In contrast the 'Superman' movies of the seventies were better developed, more measured, and not so predictable.  Here the fight scenes are too much and too long.  A comparison to 'Skyfall,' the recent 007 masterpiece, nails home the point that it isn't so much quantity than quality that make for a well-honed action adventure picture.  Still, while the story is often a hodge-podge mish-mash, I love watching the talent they too often squander, especially Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe, Laurence Fishburne, Christopher Meloni, Diane Lane, and another welcome screen performance by Kevin Costner.  And, it doesn't hurt to have the values they espouse in the screenplay mix, either.

I watched it in 3D and even that was disappointing.  The story was re-told in a way that would have embarrassed Christopher Reeve if he were still around.  Henry Cavill, although chiseled etc., had a constant dumbfounded look on his face like he just didn't understand why the chicken had to get to the other side.  Russell Crowe was the best part of this movie hands down and his presence throughout the film granted the second star in my rating.  Kristen/Amy Bell/Stewart/Adams or whatever it is, was absolutely useless for this role and a good actress that should stick to Oscar caliber films.  These guys going around re-making superhero films should get their act together and stop pretending that they're too cool for school by cutting up the story.  The experienced would have been so much more fulfilling if they would have followed the same timeline as the original and allowed the characters to develop without flashing all over and behaving stupidly.

1561130,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B008JFUPFI,Ace Reader,"[8, 16]","*** Warning! May contain spoilers. ***I really enjoyed director Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"". British actor Henry Cavill admirably plays the man of steel in this new version of ""Superman"". It's entertaining, exciting and at times emotional. I'm not a comic book reader myself but I do know something about the ""Superman"" origin story. If you are a Comic book story purist, you may strongly dislike this new ""Superman"" film. If the purist can get past the fact that the main story has been slightly altered and try to enjoy it for the pure fact it's a fantasy based on a theme, then you may find a way to enjoy this new take on ""Superman"". It's a different ""Superman"" story than anything I've seen before. It has been tweaked a lot and I liked it a lot. This new story line is interesting accompanied by jaw dropping ""CGI"" special effects. You get to see the magnificent Krypton home world realized as never before. Kal-El's father, Jor-El is played wonderfully by Russel Crowe who commands this film from the beginning and he owns it every time thereafter whenever he appears on screen. One of my biggest disappointments in this film is that there wasn't enough screen time between characters Jor-El and Kal-El. In past ""Superman"" films, I have always enjoyed this simple part when Kal-El finely meets his Dad from another world, Jor-El for the first time, converses with him and finally learns who and what he is. This part is handled well in this new version, but is sadly short lived.Our villain this time is genetically engineered Kryptonian warrior General Zod (expertly played by actor Michael Shannon), who has escaped the Phantom Zone and has traced Jor-El's son to Earth because he believes Kal-El has the Kryptonian Codex that is used to imprint on each genetically engineered Kryptonian baby what their place in life will be. He along with his sentenced Kryptonian cohorts want to change Earth into Krypton so their people can rise again using this Codex. To do that he employs a fun gadget called a World-Builder he's brought with him from the Phantom Zone. I was completely blown away by this Kryptonian Terraforming Spaceship World-Builder. Zod decides to deploy it right in the center of Metropolis City sending it's citizens fleeing in fear and panic. Metropolis is now of course, the epicenter of a new kind of Kryptonian battle. To save Earth and stop Zod's evil plans, Kal-El and General Zod engage in an epic, intense series of fight scenes that are amazing and thrilling to watch. This film is very heavy on the action side with extremely fast paced, precise (excellent, academy award winning type), film editing (by Film Editor David Brenner), that at times is hard to visually keep and up with, but beautiful to behold. If you do find that it's too much for you the first time through, I recommend seeing it a second time to clear up any problems you may have.Lois Lanes is played earnestly by actress Amy Adams who made this character her own with a sweet naivety. She's not a brunet like Lois Lane in the comics and other films. She gets herself into trouble the same way as all the others and Superman saves her as usual, but there is no emotional cement present in this film to hold these two characters together. Not one drop of romance in this entire film. Not once during this film was there any character interaction between the two main characters where any real feeling or emotions did occur. And the one really HOT kiss between Lois Lane and Kal-El seem a little out of place and forced. But I liked it all the same.I'd also like to mention three other actors who were stand-outs to me in the acting department. They are: Kevin Costner who played Clark Kent's Human Dad Jonathan Kent, Diane Lane who played Clark's Mom Martha Kent, and my favorite Christopher Meloni who impressed me playing a cocky tough-guy soldier Colonel Nathan Hardy, who goes up against powerful Kryptonians with a very cool head.During one of the many fight scenes between Zod and Kal-El, Zod picks up and throws an oil tanker at him. On the side it reads ""LEXCORP"". A hint of things to come I'm sure. ""Man of Steel"" is highly recommended.

1561132,A3KA2MOVBHFWVR,B008JFUPFI,Adam,"[16, 28]","Man of Steel, like all films from Zack Snyder, is far above average in some aspects, and far below average in others. In fact, it's about typical of his work. It's flashy and punchy and zingy, but it glosses over character and plot developments. Unlike 300, though, this film does manage to get characters into the final product, even if they aren't fully fleshed out. It's an okay film, and definitely a visual triumph, but if you're looking for a gripping time, you might want to look elsewhere. It's the perfect popcorn blockbuster.Snyder, who cut his teeth on television commercials for automobile companies and Reebok, has always been fantastic at visuals. The opening credits for Watchmen, a series of alternate universe vignettes that play out over Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-changing,"" and most of the fights in 300, despite the overuse of slo-mo, are great examples. As a result, Man of Steel looks great. The fight scenes are action-packed, even for moviegoers already overdosed on packs of action, and certain visual spectacles, like a huge building collapsing as our heroes run for cover, and, notably, the 70s-sci-fi-influenced planet of Krypton, with its dragons, underwater nurseries, and scarlet-skinned suns in the backdrop. No one can make a film look as good as Snyder, James Cameron exempted.But the characters are given no time to develop: the most we get is Clark's parents telling him what a good person he is, and Clark in turn telling everyone how good America and Earth are. It's all telling, no showing, because the `showing' is too busy wowing us with how epic everything is.One character does get developed, and is easily the best part of the film: General Zod. The guy is the only one with a clear idea of what he hopes to accomplish, he's the only one who gets screen time from the first ten minutes to the final ten minutes, and he's even the only person who really makes a worth-while effort to save Krypton in the prologue. He's a powerhouse. He essentially saves the movie by serving as its spine. With a sequel and the Justice League movie in the works, we'll see a lot more of Superman, but without Zod, we won't really know any of the characters.",3,"Looks great, but plot and characters are barebones.",1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,2191,"['Man', 'Steel', 'films', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'far', 'above', 'average', 'aspects', 'far', 'below', 'average', 'others', 'fact', 'typical', 'work', 'flashy', 'punchy', 'zingy', 'character', 'plot', 'developments', '300', 'though', 'film', 'manage', 'get', 'characters', 'final', 'product', 'even', 'are', ""n't"", 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'okay', 'film', 'definitely', 'visual', 'triumph', ""'re"", 'looking', 'gripping', 'time', 'might', 'want', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'perfect', 'popcorn', 'blockbuster.Snyder', 'who', 'cut', 'teeth', 'television', 'commercials', 'automobile', 'companies', 'Reebok', 'always', 'been', 'fantastic', 'visuals', 'opening', 'credits', 'Watchmen', 'series', 'alternate', 'universe', 'vignettes', 'play', 'out', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Times', 'Are', 'A-changing', 'most', 'fights', '300', 'overuse', 'slo-mo', 'are', 'great', 'examples', 'result', 'Man', 'Steel', 'great', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'action-packed', 'even', 'moviegoers', 'already', 'overdosed', 'packs', 'action', 'certain', 'visual', 'spectacles', 'huge', 'building', 'collapsing', 'heroes', 'run', 'cover', 'notably', '70s-sci-fi-influenced', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'dragons', 'underwater', 'nurseries', 'scarlet-skinned', 'suns', 'backdrop', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'as', 'good', 'Snyder', 'James', 'Cameron', 'exempted.But', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'time', 'develop', 'most', 'get', 'Clark', 'parents', 'telling', 'what', 'good', 'person', 'Clark', 'turn', 'telling', 'everyone', 'how', 'good', 'America', 'Earth', 'are', 'telling', 'showing', 'showing', 'too', 'busy', 'wowing', 'how', 'epic', 'everything', 'is.One', 'character', 'get', 'developed', 'easily', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'General', 'Zod', 'guy', 'only', 'one', 'clear', 'idea', 'what', 'accomplish', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'screen', 'time', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'even', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'really', 'worth-while', 'effort', 'save', 'Krypton', 'prologue', 'powerhouse', 'essentially', 'movie', 'serving', 'spine', 'sequel', 'Justice', 'League', 'movie', 'works', ""'ll"", 'see', 'lot', 'more', 'Superman', 'Zod', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'characters']",N/A

Personally I never had a problem with the Red Underwear on the outside of his costume and never really thought much about it. However I guess we all have our issues and I can't begrudge someone for that.Christoper Reeve's Superman although a bit long and dated these days will always be my the bench mark for Superman movies.  Brandon Routh in Superman Returns made a good effort and it was an entertaining film with nicely update special effects.  However he was basically playing Christopher Reeve playing Superman. Again good effort, but alas it may have sunk his career by playing it that way.  Now then flip forward a few years and we now have Man of Steel and Henry Cavil puts on the red cape. This time we have the badly needed reboot of the man with an S on his chest.Overall the movie is pretty good, and all the actors and actresses played their parts terrifically. The chemistry between Mr Cavil and Ms Adams is very good and is a credit to them that they could play their parts so well. The special effects although extreme where believable and worked when needed.My issues with this movie concern the climatic battle in Metropolis.  Am I the only that remembers all those 1000s of people who died in New York on 9/11? When you destroy a building in a major city people WILL DIE by the hundreds if not thousands.  If you destroy several large buildings 1000s more will die. Although the special effects where terrific, the battle went on far too long in my opinion. Rather they should have maybe started in Smallville, moved to Metropolis and then taken it into outer space.Another thing I found slightly annoying was the lack of legacy parts.  In the Christopher Reeve movies they always featured interesting Cameo Appearances by the past actors in bit parts.  They even did this with Superman Returns and it would have been welcomed in this movie.  How about giving the role of the Priest Clark Kent talks to someone like Jack Larson (the original George Reeves Jimmy Olsen)? The role of the Waitress in a Canadian truck stop to Margot Kidder (Ironically this would have been perfect for her, because she is from that region), Perhaps given the role of an elderly dinner in Smallville to Noel Neal. The tough guy trucker who's swings at Clark and comes out only to find his rig mangled; what a perfect part that would have been for Dean Cain. Superman is and was the ultimate superhero; even Marvel's Stan Lee once said in an interview ""none of his creations are anywhere near what Superman is, and anything he tried to create the resembled him would have been a cheap knock off."" That's pretty high praise from a rival. There was all sorts of bit parts that could have been filled by these actors and actresses from ""Superman's Past"".

1561135,ATHNYP7D3RW1A,B008JFUPFI,A. Gavin,"[5, 13]","t was with mixed feeling that I went off to Man of Steel. The trailer actually looked pretty cool, but this is a Zach Snyder film and I loathed 300 (way, way too poor a representation of that most awesome of historical battles), found Watchmen overblown, and was just plain blown by by Sucker Punch. Actually Sucker Punch fascinated me. It was both so bad and so intriguing at the same time -- plus the soundtrack rocks. The film just failed as a film.In any case, the Superman reboot. Some things I liked:The visuals and art direction. Boy does a lot of stuff explode.The soundtrack. Sounds like Batman (not surprising, Hans Zimmer returns).Henry Cavill is just about right as both Clark and Superman.Amy Adams is cute as Lois.Krypton and the Kryptonian technology. It looked cool. Somethings were silly - but it looked cool.The impressive sense of power given to Superman and his opponents.Some strong visual references to Superman II.Russel crow leading Lois through the spaceship.The fact that both dads were Robin Hood.Some things that sucked:Too many explosions. Not enough character development.Superman's cheesy Kryptonian mom and even cheesier birth sequence.A lot of the plot feels rushed and barely makes sense.Everyone seemed very calm and well informed (they needed to be to make the plot work).The extras (like the Daily Planet staff) = cheesy!The whole tornado sequence. Fromage!A lack of any dual identity antics.The forced ""Clarks gets a job"" sequence at the end.Michael Shannon as Zod. Lame. Lame. Lame.Plot holes. Lots of plot holes.Fundamentally, Man of Steel tries too hard and takes itself too seriously. There is almost no sense of humor. It focuses on plot and background at the expense of character. What arc it attempts, Superman's deliberate act of choice of humanity over his (not highly appealing) Kryptonian comrades is hardly in doubt -- and forced at best. We are treated to numerous statements on the part of both fathers as to Clark becoming the ""kind of man he should be."" Heavy handed to be sure. But still, they kinda, sorta, maybe worked, mostly I think because of the equally heavy handed but effective sound track and slow Synder-esque directorial style.I really did basically dig the whole Krypton thing and particularly the visuals of the home-world and tech. All that gray particle stuff I interpreted as nano-tech, but who knows what they had in mind. And what the hell with the dragon-fly dragons?Given that Superman is nigh on indestructible, the insane building smashing during the fights was kind of cool -- until the hundredth building. I mean they really punched through shit. Lots of CGI in this film, most shots. The battle between Superman and Zod was decent, although one does have to wonder given all this invincibility why and how one of them actually can be killed. It didn't make a lot of sense.There is no subtly to this film. The character driven mechanics of the 1978 Superman and sequel are missing entirely. Lois meets Superman as Superman, there is no Clark Kent reporter or secret identity, and hence one of the amusing/enjoyable things in secret identity superhero stories. This human drama has no room in this film of epic space battles and guys getting slapped through buildings. I can't understate this -- Kryptonians are punched through large solid structures at least 200 times in this film.Some questions:How do the new Kryptonians ""powerup"" so fast?If Superman's dad was so worried about Zod choosing the bloodlines, how come he got to choose them himself?Why is there only one copy of the codex? And while we are at it, why does it look like a plastic skull?And #1: if you planet is dying, why do you ""save"" all the villains by tucking them away in a black hole?Why do the masks/helmets of the bad guys keep fading in and out except to show who they are?How can the energy drive of the 2 part teraforming machines link up? Some cross planet induction?Why does Lois get to go on a military bombing mission?How come everyone in Metropolis hangs out for so long when the killer alien squid of doom shows up?I can understand how Superman really gets around, but it seems like Lois and the military dudes can teleport.Why does even young kent have a magnetic attraction to disasters? (tornados, falling buses, exploding oil rigs)Why doesn't Zod kidnap Superman's mom and use her as leverage?Why does he explain all his plans? Wait -- he's a comic book villain.Regardless, it's a watchable film, and certainly Snyder's best yet. It's just not a great film by any means, being about 95% style over substance. Isn't it obvious to these studio types that movies are really all about character? I guess not.And most amusingly, Man of Steel and The Last of Us (the latest Naughty Dog game) both came out on Friday.

1561138,A13UPPKNU1BO13,B008JFUPFI,A. Irey,"[402, 504]","Let me say right away that I am fan, so if you imagine that there may be some bias about this film, you'll be right.  As much as I enjoy the work done by Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan I am, first and foremost, a fan of Superman the character.  Beyond the super powers and god like awe that surrounds the character, he is inherently a symbol for the potential good of the human race.  He represents the best of both his worlds and acts as a guide for others.  Superman is often referred to as the ""constant boy scout"".  It's easier to understand when you truly see the kind of temperament and control he exhibits on a nearly constant basis.  When faced with adversity how easy would it be for him to destroy his opponent in the blink of an eye, and yet he refrains from doing so.  He is a symbol for all that we can achieve, good and bad.  In some ways he is the embodiment of hope; hope for the future, hope for the world, and hope in our own personal lives.  So, when I say that I am a fan I mean to say that this film held high expectations for me and I am glad to say that this film not only met my expectations but exceeded them.It's difficult to compare comics and movies to one another.  They are different animals, and because of that, require different things.  For those of you who are fans of the comics it may be best to show that this film has an extremely similar vibe to the ""Earth One"" story presented a few years back.  It is a reboot that while fresh and rewarding for the casual viewer truly gives back to the fans.  It's worth mentioning that I believe a movie based on a comic book should remain faithful to its original material it also needs to separate itself and be its own thing.  Thankfully that is the case with the ""Man of Steel"".  The Nolan brothers' screenplay brought to life by Zack Snyder is a wonderful homage to past material while remaining original in its own way.  The very human aspect brought to the character removes some of the awe that may separate us from him and  witnessing the struggle he deals with in understanding his two sides is the needed heart thread that grounds the film.  The characters, most of which, are easily picked out by fans of the comics are played by some rather extraordinary actors and actresses.  You can tell by the quality of actors how serious Warner Bros. was about making this a legitimate project.  I could mention each one in particular and yet somehow I feel as though it doesn't do justice to the ensemble as a whole.  Each person fits their character in a natural way and one of the things that I found myself enjoying about the film is that not one person overshadows another, they are each a piece of the puzzle that fits well into the mold.Another important facet to any Zack Snyder film is the look and feel of the film.  While the film itself is grounded in many ways due to the wonderful cast it is hard to forget just how magnificent this movie looks at times.  While each shot is truly worthy of a movie still the action scenes are the stuff of legend.  Remember that awe I spoke of surrounding the character of Superman?  This is where it shines.  Snyder is able to envision Superman and his battles in a way that captures the eyes and truly keeps us glued to the screen.  The movie has a somber low tone visually, with most of the colors subdued, but when given the opportunity to for action the screen suddenly shines and explodes.  For much of the movie I had pure goosebumps traveling up and down my spine.  So, if there are any reservations you have about buying this film on blu-ray, get rid of those right now.  You'd be doing yourself a disservice buying it on another format. Thankfully, like the ""Batman"" trilogy Nolan is so well known for, there are a few moments among the drama and action for humor, so it's not a horribly dry film without levity.  Also, the amazing Hans Zimmer has lent his talents to this film and truly created a soundtrack befitting the movie.  I'd like to point out that any time Hans Zimmer is part of a film I get a bit excited but when it was officially announced that he would do the score for this film I was eager to hear how he would pull it.  The movie moves seamlessly with each passing score and Zimmer's soundtrack only enhances the experience.In this day and age I know the idea of having two options available to customers is nice, in terms of DVD and blu-ray format, but in the case of ""Man of Steel"" I'd recommend that you buy the bundle pack.  Yes, you may not have a blu-ray player but if you ever decide to get it then you'll already have the blu-ray copy along with the DVD one.  Truth be told, I have a hard time recommending that this movie be bought solely on DVD cause it's simply too visual a movie to experience any other way than blu-ray.One of the best indicators I have for a film are the feelings I have the day afterwards.  I left my local theater following the midnight premiere and I had a hard time sleeping.  Almost a full day later I still have a sense of excitement over the movie.  This film has that something truly special.  It's not often I sit in a theater and feel like I'm taken back to being that same young kid who had aspirations of saving the world while wearing a cape (I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in this).

So, being a little restless, I was disappointed when the movie started with no exciting opening credits.The film jumps right into the origin story and the visuals are arresting. As the movie progressed I felt it slipped into some overly long moments, moments that the audience is smart enough to figure out without a rehash. Once the major action scenes kick in, about an hour into the film, Superman is poised to tear up the place, and he does just that. Henry Cavill plays Superman with a ton of humility. But he's a humble guy that has been restraining the usage of his powers that once released brings out two Hulks in one. Most of the effects are great. Some are only good because I've seen the blotchy and bubbly silver stuff a hundred times over in Terminator 2.Also needed and done to good effect are more than a few genuine moments of sentiment. Clark's childhood tells you why he is the man he is. All the big actors turn on their talents which definitely gives a credible gelling feel to it all. There are also some rightly timed chuckle inducing pieces of verbiage aimed at the name ""Superman"". Those moments are quickly and willingly sucked up due to the generally sullen nature of the characters.Lets talk FAORA (the incredible Antje Traue). She's a scene stealer, and can steal as many scenes as she wants as far as I'm concerned. Her presence pushed ""Man Of Steel"" into the statosphere. With her scary otherworldly vocals, unrestrained brutality and pure sex appeal, the sci fi lover gets a true villainess to be blown away by. I think she could hold a film of her own and would love to see her somehow brought back in future installments of the franchise. Her evil far exceeded Zods (Michael Shannon)with his slow-burn approach.Amy Adams (Lois Lane) by contrast embodies the most accurate portrayal of a professional woman for a change. The action between Faora and Lane is tremendous and well thought out. Two females from different worlds colliding without all the beauty and affection type banter. I loved that angle. I feel this film was simply an ""establish who Superman is"" film, only waiting for the real everyday occurrences of Earth and a friendly alien, Kal El, to unfold. Toward the close as a lighter tone emerges, I saw exactly what was happening as the Daily Planet becomes a focal point. A nice transition and very welcomed after a mostly somber Clark/Superman did what he had to do. You will see a few easter eggs. It's a ride that takes you through a very interesting and introspective tale about the greatest superhero ever. Multiple viewings may be required and is recommended at least at this stage for full absorption.At my showing, the audience clapped.

This one was different perhaps because it was updated. As a young man he faced a great many obstacles knowing he was different but having to hide what and who he was. The flashbacks were done very well as his youth and young adult life is explained as tragedy overtakes his family and while he can do something about it, he cannot for fear of revealing his powers. He wanders across the country going from job to job, helping in one disaster after another then disappearing. Enter Lois Lane, intrepid and determined reporter who finds herself in mystery she is determined to solve. And solve she does but Perry White refuses to go with her story. She finds a way. Unfortunately the consequences are devastating not only to Clark's family but to Earth as a threat from Krypton arrives. Once again, more insight, better explanations of a world and culture long dead make it a far superior storyline. And when General Zod comes calling, it is anything but the antiseptic battle of the old Superman as Metropolis is under siege and while it is carefully edited to show no real bloodshed, falling building, explosions and upheaval as well as destroyed jets and downed copters tell us there are a great many casualties.

1561166,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B008JFUPFI,amerdale876,"[18, 32]","So this is it. The moment all Superman fans have been waiting for since it was revealed that Dark Knight trilogy helmsman Christopher Nolan and director Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead - Unrated Director's Cut,300 (Two-Disc Special Edition),Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut) were rebooting the franchise. Of course, ""Man of Steel"" is better than any current standalone Marvel Comics movie (i.e., Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, or any of the Iron Man trilogy). But the question most people may ask is: ""Is it better thanMarvel's The Avengers?"" More on that in a moment.Anyone who knows me knows I'm a big Supermen fan and not much of a Marvel fan (save for Daredevil and The Punisher), but I can honestly say that ""The Avengers"" was an excellent film -- the most perfect (next toThe Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition)) comic book adaptation to date. When critiquing a comic book film, I not only look at story, acting, and directing, but also if the film sticks to or addresses the original material. Both Marvel and DC comic characters' origins have been retconned, reimagined and rewritten so many times over the years since they first were originally introduced to the world that filmmakers have had a lot of material with which to work. And while some creative license is allowed, the story must stay mostly true to the comic book story and the characters have to definitely stay true to their comic book counterparts.I remember seeing the original 1978Superman - The Movie (Four-Disc Special Edition), starring Christopher Reeve, and loving it. I still love it to this day. But that Superman was one for younger and/or more general audiences -- a tongue-in-cheek Lex Luthor, his goofy, bumbling sidekick Otis, the sexy, misunderstood ""bad"" girl Miss Teschmacher, and a Lois Lane who is nothing short of annoying. Reeve's performance was excellent, but, as most Superman fans can tell you, his Clark Kent was the C.K. of old. The new Clark Kent -- while still a little bit of a klutz and wearing glasses -- isn't quite so dorky (think Tom Welling's portrayal from The CW'sSmallville: The Complete Series). Also, no offense to Richard Donner's masterpiece, but the 1978 film simply does not achieve the greatness of the comic and who Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman has become over the years since. When I was a kid and a teenager, I always preferred Batman to Superman because Batman was a darker comic and darker character; his parents were murdered, people died. The teen angst in me related to him and his plight. Whereas Superman -- at the time -- seemed like a goody-two-shoes, a boy scout. And while he still may be that kind of superhero, as I've grown, my admiration for the Kryptonian has grown, seeing how he has more problems than one may contemplate. If you were to think more about Superman's plight, you'd see that he doesn't have it so easy either. There are many philosophical complexities and moral dilemmas presented in Superman's stories. ""Man of Steel"" features all of these complexities of Kal-El's existence:1) The knowledge that despite his love for humans and his feeling of being one, knowing he will always be an outsider -- check!2) The knowledge that any time an alien comes to defeat him or make him suffer, it is his mere presence on Earth that brings them there so he believes any destruction or human casualty is his fault -- check!3) The knowledge that any small physical reaction could lead to instant disaster and would garner great scrutiny and fear from the humans he so loves -- check!4) Having to truly sacrifice those he loves the most ... even meaning letting loved ones die for the ""greater good"" -- check!5) Being solely opposed to killing ... no matter good or evil -- check!It has been reported that the ""controversy"" (if that's what you want to call it) of ""Man of Steel"" particularly touches on two aspects of the film. One involves that last bullet point I just mentioned. The other is the destruction of Metropolis at the end of the film when Superman (Henry Cavill) fights General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his Kryptonian cronies -- an inevitable result considering a bunch of super-powered alien beings are there to take over the planet and trying to kill Superman (this is definitely no Superman II where Superman flies away to avoid destruction and human casualties). The fact that the destruction of a city is even an issue proves that critics and audiences are merely nitpicking for any negative criticism they can find. Was there a lot of this nitpicking when ""The Avengers,"" ""Watchmen,"" ""Transformers 3,"" or ""G.I. Joe"" were released (and that doesn't include all of the numerous alien-related films where New York is destroyed)? Did their destruction of a city sully the film's worth? Besides, if you want to get into semantics, then you have to remember that Superman has unlimited strength and can move at the speed of light, so I'm sure the city could be rebuilt in no time. Besides, if it weren't for the heavy action you expect from a Superman film, then those same critics who are moaning about the destruction of a city would be saying how little action there was in the film (remember what most people said about Bryan Singer's 2006Superman Returns (Two-Disc Special Edition)?).So ... onto the question I originally posed: Is ""Man of Steel"" better than ""The Avengers?"" Yes. And I'll tell you why. Basically the same type of threat that was in ""The Avengers"" (i.e. a demigod being attempting to have alien beings take over Earth, starting with a major city) is the same threat in Man of Steel. The one major difference? The threat that took an entire superhero team (and a few random regular humans) to diffuse in ""The Avengers"" took only one man (and a few random regular humans) in ""Man of Steel!"" But it's just not that. Man of Steel takes the audience into every aspect of Superman's character (his birth and more background into his birth parents and home planet, his formative years, and his reclaiming his heritage and powers), and also injects some of the new origin material that has inhabited the comics for the past few years. The scope is massive and Snyder pulls it off without making the audience roll their eyes. To say this is not your grandfather's or father's Superman is a huge understatement! ""Man of Steel"" introduces the audience to the contemporary Superman. Nolan and screenwriting partner David S. Goyer inject more of the alien world and technology of Krypton into the story, which is necessary seeing how the main hero and villain(s) are alien (Kryptonian) and this is an origin story. The film explores both Clark's farm-bred past and his isolated present, which is what makes the story so great. Unlike ""Avengers,"" which would not have worked if not for each character (save Hawkeye and Black Widow) having their own respective movie before its release, ""Man of Steel"" shows both Kal-El and Zod's background, almost making Zod a character with which to sympathize. In fact, there is a bit of art imitating life when it comes to Zod's views as well as the reason behind Krypton's fate. But I cannot go into those points without giving away the story.I believe an updated cinematic origin and retelling of Superman is long overdue, and Nolan, Snyder and company have greatly succeeded! The acting is well-done, the writing is stellar (with plenty of quotable lines), there is plenty of action (at least enough of what a fan would expect from a Superman movie), and every major complexity of Kal-El's life is conveyed in all of its bittersweet glory. Plus, there are hidden hints at the existence of both Lex Luthor (see the tractor trailer logos?) and Bruce Wayne (see the satellite Zod throws at Superman?). What more could a true fan ask for?****SPOILER ALERT****Some may not like the fact that Lois Lane (Amy Adams) finds out Superman's true identity but I thought it was a breath of fresh air. Honestly, how could a respective, professional reporter like Lois not tell who Clark was just because of him wearing glasses?****END OF SPOILER****Some critics did not like the way particular characters were treated but I found all situations understandable and adding more depth to the story. It should be pointed out that if Nolan & company did a somewhat ""traditional"" origin story -- the same one all audiences have seen over and over again -- critics and audiences alike would be quick to point it out and complain about how unoriginal and ho-hum the film would be. If there are two things that ""Man of Steel"" is not, it's unoriginal and ho-hum! These people are just overly critical blowhards who can't be pleased. And for anyone who thought any part of the film's story was confusing, I'd wonder where they were coming from as I found the film's story not that difficult to follow. When you go to see ""Man of Steel,"" prepare for lots of action, a good glimpse at Krypton, a touching story and the epic beginning of a spectacular universe of characters! If ""Man of Steel"" is the beginning franchise in what DC Comics Films will be offering, we're in for one hell of a fun, imaginative, heartfelt, cool ride!

1561169,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B008JFUPFI,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 5]","I have to say, the reviews weren&#8217;t very kind, and word of mouth was even worse.  True comic book fans were furious, offended even, and the comic universe, while months earlier were brimming with pure excitement and anticipation, were pretty much ticked off that all that hype and all that buzz was for something they deemed unworthy.  Sure, it had it&#8217;s nice points and found validation in the slew of comments about those special effects, but outside of that many found themselves disconnected from Zack Snyder&#8217;s direction and found the film&#8217;s epic conclusion to be more controversial than desired.Despite all of this going on, I really wanted to see this in the theaters but wound up missing it entirely, even when it hit the local dollar theater.So, I settled in last night and geeked out while I apparently appreciated this far more than the rest of the world.  I guess the fact that I was never really a Superman fan in general probably helped a lot, since I had no expectations and no nostalgic attachments to who or what Superman was supposed to represent.  At the end of the day, I just wanted to be entertained&#8230;and I was!Like many new action films today, there was a detractor for me in that elongated ending that really should have been cut in half.  &#8216;Iron Man 3&#8217; suffered from it, as did &#8216;Star Trek Into Darkness&#8217;.  It&#8217;s weird to me the sudden shift in action films being rather lengthy, when for the longest time they were notoriously brisk and easy to sit through.  &#8216;Gravity&#8217; was a brisk 90 minutes, but the bulk of these summer Blockbusters are pushing 2  hours and I just don&#8217;t get it.  I understand you have a story to tell, but do we really need you to unload all your special effects glory in a full on thirty minute fight scene where you basically just destroy building after building to the point where it becomes a redundant blur of special effects?  I mean, I enjoy a good fight scene/action scene/explosion sequence or whatever, but let&#8217;s try and show a little restraint.But let&#8217;s move onto more positive feedback.Seriously, if we exclude that final act, &#8216;Man of Steel&#8217; is kind of perfect.  It feels more serious in tone, but not quite as dark as Nolan&#8217;s universe (which is appropriate considering the hero in question).  The use of flashbacks are great at filling in the gaps without taking away from the crux of the story.  We don&#8217;t need to watch Clark grow up, but the selected &#8216;moments&#8217; from his childhood are great (that closet schoolroom scene is perfection).  The cinematography is gorgeous, and calls to mind more artistic fare (I remember all the Malick comparisons when the trailer hit), and the pacing for the first two thirds of the film is fantastic.  The way that the story is built, it just feels so organic and the acting from all (especially Costner, Crowe and Lane) are so natural and free flowing that you can&#8217;t help but become completely sucked in.Speaking of Crowe, I could have watched an entire feature length film revolving around Jor-El and the destruction of Krypton.  Seriously, that world was gorgeous and that dragon soaring was marvelous(eat your heart out &#8216;Avatar&#8217;) and Crowe was easily the best thing about this film (I was so happy he kept popping up).And then there is that finale.  So many things have been written and debated about the ending and I just have this to say (without spoiling anything)&#8230;while I take issue with the fact that it last SO LONG (seriously, that fight scene between Superman and Zod&#8217;s henchmen was ridiculous), the actual final moment that has all the Superman fans riled up was, in my eyes, PERFECT.  YES, this is what we need with these superhero reboots.  Give him a moral dilemma!  Confliction!  He may be super, but let&#8217;s attack him where it counts!  His final cry, his emotional and moral defeat&#8230;it was everything this movie needed to be.Yes, I understand that fans have their issues with this, but it really MADE ME a fan.Snyder tries something really good here, and while he doesn&#8217;t completely pull it off (his true limitations as a director came in the editing and the over ambitiousness of the finale) he creates something worthy of praise and really creates a nice stepping stone for himself here.  I hope he can follow it up with something equally inspired and continue to build on the character development he initiated here.",4,Can we take a few moments to discuss how this film doesn&#8217;t suck?,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,4494,"['have', 'say', 'reviews', 'weren', '8217', 'very', 'kind', 'word', 'mouth', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'True', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'were', 'furious', 'offended', 'even', 'comic', 'universe', 'months', 'earlier', 'were', 'brimming', 'pure', 'excitement', 'anticipation', 'were', 'pretty', 'much', 'ticked', 'off', 'hype', 'buzz', 'was', 'something', 'deemed', 'unworthy', 'Sure', 'had', '8217', 'nice', 'points', 'found', 'validation', 'slew', 'comments', 'special', 'effects', 'many', 'found', 'disconnected', 'Zack', 'Snyder', '8217', 'direction', 'found', 'film', '8217', 'epic', 'conclusion', 'be', 'more', 'controversial', 'desired.Despite', 'going', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'theaters', 'wound', 'up', 'missing', 'entirely', 'even', 'when', 'hit', 'local', 'dollar', 'theater.So', 'settled', 'last', 'night', 'geeked', 'out', 'apparently', 'appreciated', 'far', 'more', 'rest', 'world', 'guess', 'fact', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'Superman', 'fan', 'general', 'probably', 'helped', 'lot', 'had', 'expectations', 'nostalgic', 'attachments', 'who', 'what', 'Superman', 'was', 'supposed', 'represent', 'end', 'day', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'entertained', '8230', 'was', 'many', 'new', 'action', 'films', 'today', 'was', 'detractor', 'elongated', 'ending', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'half', '8216', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', '8217', 'suffered', 'did', '8216', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', '8217', '8217', 's', 'weird', 'sudden', 'shift', 'action', 'films', 'being', 'rather', 'lengthy', 'when', 'longest', 'time', 'were', 'notoriously', 'brisk', 'easy', 'sit', '8216', 'Gravity', '8217', 'was', 'brisk', '90', 'minutes', 'bulk', 'summer', 'Blockbusters', 'are', 'pushing', '2', 'hours', 'just', 'don', '8217', 'get', 'understand', 'have', 'story', 'tell', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'unload', 'special', 'effects', 'glory', 'full', 'thirty', 'minute', 'fight', 'scene', 'where', 'basically', 'just', 'destroy', 'building', 'building', 'point', 'where', 'redundant', 'blur', 'special', 'effects', 'mean', 'enjoy', 'good', 'fight', 'scene/action', 'scene/explosion', 'sequence', 'whatever', 'let', '8217', 'try', 'show', 'little', 'restraint.But', 'let', '8217', 's', 'move', 'more', 'positive', 'feedback.Seriously', 'exclude', 'final', 'act', '8216', 'Man', 'Steel', '8217', 'kind', 'perfect', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'dark', 'Nolan', '8217', 's', 'universe', 'appropriate', 'considering', 'hero', 'question', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'great', 'filling', 'gaps', 'taking', 'away', 'crux', 'story', 'don', '8217', 'need', 'watch', 'Clark', 'grow', 'up', 'selected', '8216', 'moments', '8217', 'childhood', 'are', 'great', 'closet', 'schoolroom', 'scene', 'perfection', 'cinematography', 'gorgeous', 'mind', 'more', 'artistic', 'fare', 'remember', 'Malick', 'comparisons', 'when', 'trailer', 'hit', 'pacing', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'fantastic', 'way', 'story', 'built', 'just', 'feels', 'so', 'organic', 'acting', 'especially', 'Costner', 'Crowe', 'Lane', 'are', 'so', 'natural', 'free', 'flowing', 'can', '8217', 'help', 'become', 'completely', 'sucked', 'in.Speaking', 'Crowe', 'could', 'have', 'watched', 'entire', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'revolving', 'Jor-El', 'destruction', 'Krypton', 'Seriously', 'world', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'dragon', 'soaring', 'was', 'marvelous', 'eat', 'heart', '8216', 'Avatar', '8217', 'Crowe', 'was', 'easily', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'kept', 'popping', 'up', '.And', 'then', 'finale', 'So', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'debated', 'ending', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'spoiling', 'anything', '8230', 'take', 'issue', 'fact', 'last', 'SO', 'LONG', 'seriously', 'fight', 'scene', 'Superman', 'Zod', '8217', 's', 'henchmen', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'actual', 'final', 'moment', 'Superman', 'fans', 'riled', 'up', 'was', 'eyes', 'PERFECT', 'YES', 'what', 'need', 'superhero', 'reboots', 'Give', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'Confliction', 'may', 'be', 'super', 'let', '8217', 's', 'attack', 'where', 'final', 'cry', 'emotional', 'moral', 'defeat', '8230', 'was', 'everything', 'movie', 'needed', 'be.Yes', 'understand', 'fans', 'have', 'issues', 'really', 'MADE', 'ME', 'fan.Snyder', 'something', 'really', 'good', 'here', '8217', 'completely', 'pull', 'off', 'true', 'limitations', 'director', 'came', 'editing', 'over', 'ambitiousness', 'finale', 'something', 'worthy', 'praise', 'really', 'nice', 'stepping', 'stone', 'here', 'hope', 'can', 'follow', 'up', 'something', 'equally', 'inspired', 'continue', 'build', 'character', 'development', 'initiated', 'here']",N/A

I don't ""gush"" about movies, ever, and I am not in the habit of rating action movies or superhero movies with 5 stars. But my choice to rate Man of Steel so highly is not my own. Well actually, it is my own. But it was my own several weeks ago, when I saw Man of Steel in the cinema.Below is what I wrote, or rather, transcribed, as the words flowed from my fingers through the keyboard. This is a moment captured in time, written several hours after I saw the film. They are my thoughts on the film before I had a chance to think it over, to contemplate it, to read what the critics thought.These were my INITIAL feelings on Man of Steel:""WOW! Now THIS is how to do a Superman movie! For once, a film that lives up to the hype! For once, a film that makes Superman compelling, relateable, and conflicted. Sure, it's nothing like the comics! There's little humour, less warmth, and Superman is given the Dark Knight treatment (and proves that he can stand up to it, unlike some other superheroes. Marc Webb, I am looking directly at you (Thanks for ruining The Amazing Spider-Man)). But the entire cast gives stunning roles: Crowe and Costner manage the weightier bits with ease, Cavill is perfect (mastering the human side and the super side of Kal-El, and looking the part 100%), Adams is good, but feels underutilized. Shannon oozes menace and quivering rage, and Lane is great too.The villains are a real menace, with Shannon managing to keep up with Terrence Stamp (a very hard act to follow), and the other Kryptonians providing muscle and real danger. For once, Superman feels vulnerable and weak compared to these machines of war. This is superhero fighting without arrows, webs, batarangs, or hammers. This is superheroes fighting down and dirty, mano el mano. Matrix style, with less kung fu and bullet time.The action is grand, gritty, and intense. The score by Hans Zimmer is brilliant and blood-rousing! Nolan appears to be keeping Snyder's wilder side grounded (No ramping! No super--slow motion!). The result is a large, sprawling, and weighty Superman movie. Where Iron Man 3 was perfect popcorn Marvel entertainment, Man of Steel strives for something greater. It does not always reach it, but when it does, the result is truly incredible.THIS! IS! SUPERMAN! 4.5 Stars!""Woah. Check that out. I really WAS gushing. I was using ALL-CAPS and exclamation marks. I inserted a slightly cheesy Zack Snyder joke. I must not have been in my right mind.And I wasn't.The film had overwhelmed me. There was just too much to comprehend. My brain was still in awe from booming Zimmer music, darkly comedic and completely awesome one-liners, gigantic all-destroying setpieces, and the sight of two Spandex-clad superheroes throwing punches that would level a city.If I was to rate the film now, I would probably give it 4 stars, not 5. I see now, why critical reception has been mixed. There is an absence of strong female characters. The plot is jumbled and does not always work. What on earth was up with hologram Jor-El? There is just TOO much CGI city destruction (and you though Transformers was bad), and the casual attitude in which superheroes destroy gigantic buildings, most likely killing thousands, is, well, sickening. And Superman does something completely unlike Superman - he kills.Man of Steel is, like Zack Snyder's 300, a relatively simple minded affair. A film where you leave your brain at the door. Lots of action, lots of six-packs, a lot of punching, and not many female characters.And like 300, the action is superb and intense and gritty, the six-packs are present, the punching is awesome, and the result is an epic (I say this in the truest sense of the word) action superhero film.I repeat my praise for the actors. I felt Henry Cavill turned in a (literal) towering performance. Michael Shannon was a quivering, bellowing mass of rage. Superman's two dads are perfect. Both Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner moved me to (metaphorical) tears with ""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders,"" and pretty much anything Costner said. Seriously, Costner was TERRIFIC!You may pine for the simplicity and the charm of Superman I, and Christopher Reeves' dimple and forelock. I certainly pined for the criminally underrated Superman Returns (don't kill me for it, please, please, please), since it captured the Big Blue Boy Scout side of Superman. But Man of Steel is in a category of it's own.It is not a wholly seamless film. It has many, many problems. But I ask you to overlook that, and see the greatness beyond. I feel the words of Jor-El are appropriate in describing Man of Steel: It stumbles, it falls. But in time, it accomplishes WONDERS.The result is nothing short of amazing.My critical rating: 4.2My initial Rating: 4.5 Stars.Highly Recommended! 4.5 Stars!P.S.

1561181,A3327KH3Z7GZ1F,B008JFUPFI,"Anthony L. Wallace ""ALW""","[5, 15]","Of any film to be released with Christopher Nolan's name somewhat behind a project it was Man of Steel. What I enjoyed most was the first twenty minutes of the movie that took place on the planet Krypton. I would have enjoyed seeing more of planet Krypton be fleshed out. Then the story comes to earth and that's where I felt everything was rushed. To start, the story was all over the place and was trying to be told through action-set pieces, disasters, and chaos. It was difficult for me to care or understand what Cal-El was going through as he took on the mantel. Cal-El's relationship with Lois Lane was forced considering I didn't feel any kind of chemistry between the two. I think there could have been more character development for Lois and maybe carry the love element into the sequel rather than all in just one film.Another thing I wasn't a big fan of was there being too much action in the last 45 minutes of the movie. Now it's not like action is terrible to be in a movie but there needs to be balance. The story got muddled in-between with Zach Snyder's style and Christopher Nolan's vision. There were a lot of great elements in the movie: planet Krypton; the S symbol being a sign of hope; and the task in keeping your secret from others and the amount of responsibility placed in the hands of someone who is different from everyone else.Lastly I will mention one individual who did not disappoint and that was Hans Zimmer. If I can say the one thing that was great it would have to be Hans Zimmer's score for this movie. Hans continues to amaze me and every film he becomes a part of. So for Man of Steel I would say there was potential and unfortunately it became a disappointment. With the sequel of Man of Steel including Batman in the mix I am worried that too much will be forced into the movie; especially if they still have to introduce Lex Luthor, Batman, kryptonite, and how long after it has taken to rebuild the city.",3,Man of Epic Disappointment,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,1949,"['film', 'be', 'released', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'name', 'somewhat', 'project', 'was', 'Man', 'Steel', 'What', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'was', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'took', 'place', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'more', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'be', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Then', 'story', 'earth', 'where', 'felt', 'everything', 'was', 'rushed', 'start', 'story', 'was', 'place', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'told', 'action-set', 'pieces', 'disasters', 'chaos', 'was', 'difficult', 'care', 'understand', 'what', 'Cal-El', 'was', 'going', 'took', 'mantel', 'Cal-El', 'relationship', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'was', 'forced', 'considering', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'kind', 'chemistry', 'two', 'think', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'Lois', 'maybe', 'carry', 'love', 'element', 'sequel', 'rather', 'just', 'one', 'film.Another', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'was', 'being', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'last', '45', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Now', 'not', 'like', 'action', 'terrible', 'be', 'movie', 'there', 'be', 'balance', 'story', 'got', 'muddled', 'in-between', 'Zach', 'Snyder', 'style', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'vision', 'were', 'lot', 'great', 'elements', 'movie', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'S', 'symbol', 'being', 'sign', 'hope', 'task', 'keeping', 'secret', 'others', 'amount', 'responsibility', 'placed', 'hands', 'someone', 'who', 'different', 'everyone', 'else.Lastly', 'will', 'mention', 'one', 'individual', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'was', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'great', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'movie', 'Hans', 'amaze', 'film', 'part', 'So', 'Man', 'Steel', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'potential', 'unfortunately', 'became', 'disappointment', 'sequel', 'Man', 'Steel', 'including', 'Batman', 'mix', 'am', 'worried', 'too', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'movie', 'especially', 'still', 'have', 'introduce', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Batman', 'kryptonite', 'how', 'long', 'taken', 'rebuild', 'city']",N/A

The difference here, aside from the flashbacks to Superman's childhood, is the more in-depth character development of General Zod.  Sure he is evil, however, from the standpoint of wanting to preserve his race, you could at least see where he is coming from.  He is not just evil for evil's sake - he thinks he is right - even if it means obliterating another race (ours) to save his own.Of course, lots of action and Henry Cavill makes a superb Superman!Worth a watch, in my opinion.",4,Nice angle on a popular superhero.,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,545,"['thought', 'was', 'nice', 'angle', 'story', 'already', 'know', 'difference', 'here', 'aside', 'flashbacks', 'Superman', 'childhood', 'more', 'in-depth', 'character', 'development', 'General', 'Zod', 'Sure', 'evil', 'however', 'standpoint', 'wanting', 'preserve', 'race', 'could', 'least', 'see', 'where', 'coming', 'not', 'just', 'evil', 'evil', 'sake', 'right', 'even', 'obliterating', 'race', 'save', 'own.Of', 'course', 'lots', 'action', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'superb', 'Superman', 'watch', 'opinion']",N/A
1561183,AI37X1O7K72FZ,B008JFUPFI,Anti-Hipster,"[6, 17]","Man of Steel highlights just how far special effects have come since the 1978 Superman film. In Man of Steel, Superman really looks like a man suspended in flight, compared to the 1978 film, where Superman looks like he is suspended in front of a jittery screen. In addition, there are plenty of explosions, CGI-laden battles and an epic bad guy showdown--in short, everything you'd expect from a big-budget summer blockbuster. On the downside, there was a great deal of product placement in the movie. The Daily Planet is not a real newspaper, so why do the businesses need to be real? Some of the ads are downright intrusive, so much so that they momentarily stall the action. The worst ad appears toward the end of the movie, when Superman takes off into the air from a street. When this happens, the camera doesn't follow Superman's path; instead, it stays focused on the street. Now, why did the audience need to see that shot? Why didn't the camera immediately follow Superman? Obviously, the director wanted the audience to see a Sears store on the street, even though that put a temporary lull in the action. That was such a blatant product placement that some people in the audience laughed. There were also some odd scenes involving Lois Lane. What was she doing aboard a military aircraft carrying a special weapon designed to kill the bad guys? She's a reporter, not a bombardier. And when an alien small arm fell into her hands, how did she know how to fire it? Lois Lane should have played a minor role in the film, since she doesn't investigate Superman until Clark Kent is working at the Daily Planet.

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[10, 17]","A sole survivor of the doomed planet Krypton grows up on Earth and discovers he has abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Once grown, he sets off to find out who he is and where he comes from. The answer is discovered in a spaceship in the arctic and Krypton's last son, Kal-El--Clark Kent--meets a hologram of his long-dead father, Jor-El, who reveals to him his destiny: a beacon of hope for humanity, and also one who could one day restore the doomed Kryptonian race.Enter Zod, a harsh general and one who has fought his whole life to protect Krypton and its people. During an altercation with Jor-El he finds out that Jor-El has sent his newborn son off world and along with the child plans for Kryptonian's future. A battle ensues and Zod is sent off planet, too, him and his cohorts banished to the Phantom Zone for rehabilitation. When Krypton explodes, the containment units holding Zod and his followers release them and he spends the next thirty-three years combing the stars, searching for Jor-El's son.Locating Kal-El on Earth, Zod sends an ultimatum to the planet, forcing Kal-El to reveal himself to the humans and to stop Zod from using Earth as ground zero for a new Krypton. Zod, like Kal-El, is now powered by the Earth's yellow sun and is empowered with superabilities. An enormous battle ensues between Krypton's general and Kal-El, the fate of the Earth hanging in the balance.What can I say? This movie is mind blowing! It's epic, it's incredible. So much was riding on this film to deliver a Superman movie that would captivate audiences and restore the Man of Steel to his rightful place as king of the superheroes. Man of Steel does just that and then some, bringing with it the awesome sci-fi factors of Star Wars to the dense storytelling of The Dark Knight Trilogy.There has never, ever been a superhero movie like this before. Henry Cavill as Superman nailed the part. He's a nice guy, a caring guy, but he's dead serious about doing the right thing and exudes the confidence that only one who has sold himself out for the good of all can portray. He did something that was never done before by any other Superman actor: showing Clark Kent before he was Superman or even the bumbling reporter of the Daily Planet. (I'm referring to the movies, not Smallville). In fact, he's this version of Clark Kent for nearly the whole movie. You can see him making the big decisions, weighing his upbringing against this new task of saving the world that was suddenly dropped on his lap. You journey along with him as he wrestles with his being different and how those differences apply to not just his life, but the lives of others. As Superman, he's the Superman. I never thought Christopher Reeve's performance could be outdone, but Henry Cavill matches, if not exceeds, what Mr. Reeve brought to the character. Cavill's Superman is one hundred percent devoted to staying true to who he is, his abilities, his upbringing, his quest for truth and justice, and for putting his foot down both with men and rebel Kryptonians when needed. I can't really comment on his reporter Clark persona because that's not a big role in this movie. I hope, however, it will be in the sequel and we'll see plenty of Lois and Clark interaction in the next one, especially after the way the Lois and Clark relationship is portrayed in this movie. You'll have to see for yourself to see what I mean.Michael Shannon as Zod was crazy good. The guy can act and his Zod is much different than Terrence Stamp's. Yes, both are ruthless, but whereas Stamp's Zod was more about power grabbing and his desire to rule, Shannon's is about giving it his all to restore the former glory of Krypton at any cost, even if that means eradicating all of Earth's population to do it. The best villain is always the villain you accidently find yourself rooting for, and that happened to me throughout this movie. Every so often I felt for Zod and understood what he was trying to accomplish. It made sense and made me consider that maybe if I was in his shoes I would've done the same thing or something similar.Amy Adams as Lois Lane was a good choice. I wasn't sure at first, as I know Amy Adams as more of a happy-go-lucky girl from other movies far removed from the superhero genre--though she was in one episode of Smallville during its first season--but she sold me on the part and she reminded of the Lois Lanes from the old cartoons: warm, but cut and dry. Funny, but serious about what she does and her desire to go the distance to get a story.The action in this movie was crazy huge. The bar has been set so high in terms of superhero cinema in recent years and Man of Steel makes every superhero movie that's come before it look like a puppet show in comparison. The wide-scale destruction wrought by Superman and Zod--never mind Zod's right-hand-woman Faora and the other rebel Kryptonians--is what you'd expect if people with god-like powers let loose in an all-out brawl across a city. And the speed, man, the speed! Normally super speed is shown as either a big blur or done in slo-mo, with the super speedsters moving quickly while everyone else is frozen. In this one, you see Superman et al. zipping around, pausing, breaking sound barriers, and bringing the viewer along as if we're in his shoes the whole time and experiencing the thrill of super speed ourselves. The way Superman flies in this is unlike any other portrayal before, and while I loved how he flies in the other movies and TV shows, in this one he seems to hurl himself through the air at times, while at others flies with precision and care. The heat vision effect in this was stellar. The glow beneath the skin around the eyes and to see the veins beneath its surface made it all the more menacing. The super hearing and X-ray vision were familiar territory to those who've watched Smallville, but there was no all-out X-ray vision where everything is dark blue and white.The fighting between Superman and Zod was serious business and was truly a portrayal of two warriors going toe-to-toe and not just wrestling or tapping each other. It was one crazy hard blow after another, some slow, some rapid, even some in the sky! Insane! So many times I was blown away and just going wow, wow, wow! Zod fought the skill of a trainer warrior, whereas Superman fought with brute force.Man of Steel is a crazy good movie with a strong story, an incredible cast, and superhero action that has now become the benchmark for anything to follow. To be honest, I don't know if it can be followed. Hopefully in Man of Steel 2.Super recommended.",5,In A Word? EPIC. In Two?

Apparently on Kripton if you do something bad they spend TONS of manpower, money, energy, and time on putting people into ice crystal things and rocketting them into space. All I could think was how annoying that must be for the people of Kripton who would most likely be saying ""Why can't we just put them in a cell and have them walk there? It would save money and resources."" The worst part is that they send the criminals into space just before the planet dies making sure they are the only ones who live. What was the point of that? Just keep them on the planet so they die with everybody else. And let's not forget that those scenes lasted for over TWENTY MINUTES! I missed the very end of the movie because I just got tired of sitting there for so long watching such a long movie. They really could have cut that first part down by a lot!So it was a very long and dramatic lead up to superman arriving on Earth, but then they just SKIP OVER his arrival and have him as a grown up. They do some flash backs of when he was a kid though. I wouldn't mind if they skipped over his arrival if they didn't just spend over 20 minutes building up to that point.I did like Lois and her tracking back his deeds and find out who he was. It was always unrealistic that somebody like Lois would not be able to figure out who superman really was so PROPS to that.I didn't like how superman STOLE clothes. Superman wouldn't do that. He could have just ASKED for some clothes. Superman is an honest and good guy with strong moral character .. that's why people love him, not just because he has powers. He's not a thief.

First what I liked about the film, I thought casting Cavill as Superman they couldn't' t have found a better actor to fit this role. The director and screen writer, editor of this film, I can' t say much about them! These 3 people made this film into another typical action pack super hero movie! Superman is not typical, he represents more than being your regular super hero than the others do!But that is how he is portrayed in comic books with movies this film I do give it credit by making the film up to date. By his costume and the great sequences of Krypton! The tongue and cheek of past Superman movies you will not find here. This movie takes itself seriously and the director wants you as the viewer to do so too! The biggest complaint is the character development in this film was lost and replaced with more action sequences than dialogue.For the kids today to know who Superman is they won't by this film! In fact, the violence, religious undertones ( in which Superman is NOT religious)I would be cautious in allowing a child under the age of 10 to view this picture! Watching Cavill is captivating and I will look forward to the second one which I hope they give him more lines to speak than just a couple here and there! Additionally, find another director for this movie is not about a rich man with gadgets but a man from another world who is struggling with inner turmoil of being a man from another planet who is carrying a lot of weight on his shoulders and that weight is to save people in a world he didn't come from but was raised in.",4,Henry Cavill rocks as Superman!,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,1655,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Superman', 'reading', 'comics', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'First', 'what', 'liked', 'film', 'thought', 'casting', 'Cavill', 'Superman', 'could', ""n't"", ""'"", 't', 'have', 'found', 'better', 'actor', 'fit', 'role', 'director', 'screen', 'writer', 'editor', 'film', 'can', 't', 'say', 'much', '3', 'people', 'made', 'film', 'typical', 'action', 'pack', 'super', 'hero', 'movie', 'Superman', 'not', 'typical', 'more', 'being', 'regular', 'super', 'hero', 'others', 'do', 'how', 'portrayed', 'comic', 'books', 'movies', 'film', 'do', 'give', 'credit', 'making', 'film', 'up', 'date', 'costume', 'great', 'sequences', 'Krypton', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'past', 'Superman', 'movies', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'here', 'movie', 'seriously', 'director', 'viewer', 'do', 'so', 'too', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'was', 'lost', 'replaced', 'more', 'action', 'sequences', 'dialogue.For', 'kids', 'today', 'know', 'who', 'Superman', 'wo', ""n't"", 'film', 'fact', 'violence', 'religious', 'undertones', 'Superman', 'NOT', 'religious', 'would', 'be', 'cautious', 'allowing', 'child', 'age', '10', 'view', 'picture', 'Watching', 'Cavill', 'captivating', 'will', 'look', 'forward', 'second', 'one', 'hope', 'give', 'more', 'lines', 'speak', 'just', 'couple', 'here', 'there', 'Additionally', 'find', 'director', 'movie', 'not', 'rich', 'man', 'gadgets', 'man', 'world', 'who', 'struggling', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'being', 'man', 'planet', 'who', 'carrying', 'lot', 'weight', 'shoulders', 'weight', 'save', 'people', 'world', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'was', 'raised']",N/A

Prologue vignettes of Clark saving people before donning the suit were magnificent as well as his heroic self discipline not to abuse his powers akin to the newest (ie best) rendition of Amazing Spider-Man 2012.  However, the 20 minutes of wasted time during the fight scene to simply demonstrate special effects was a tedious waste of time akin to derailment that constituted Transformers 3 and Inception.  Hollywood still does not realize that action is fine if it fits the story as with Eagle Eye.  A believable Superman would have diverted Zod to the ocean or desert away from the urban populace to minimize risks to life and infrastructure assets.  We want a story, not crap action if action is pointless and noncontributory.Also, America consists of whites, blacks, Asians, latinos...  Normal Americans embrace that all law abiding citizens are equal.  Akin to Brad Pitt's boss in World Wide Z being black, Avengers re-written to make Nick Fury black, President and 2nd in command in 2012 being black, making the general black and colonel white while simultaneously rewriting comic lore for 70+ years to make Perry White a black is insulting as Hollywood pushes their agenda without cause.  We are all equal and if Hollywood truly believed this then they would not pander to solicit approval.  All of the black actors were fantastic and incredibly skilled but I tire of the unsolicited Hollywood repetative agenda.Finally, I encourage all viewers to embrace a one year boycott of all distracting advertising during movies that WE PAY TO VIEW as paying for advertising in the midst of our movies is insulting to the viewer and detracts from the continuity of enjoying the film.  IHOP was advertised no less than 3 times during the movie and Sears was distinctly advertised once with the camera fixated on the Sears logo. For one year from my 6/22/13 viewing I will refuse to enter IHOP or Sears such that companies realize that by submitting to maximizing Hollywood profits they will minimize their own profits by consensus public boycott.  We can teach Hollywood not to sacrifice the story line by intrusive inappropriate advertising.In conclusion, Man of Steel, if one ignores the wasteful protracted action fight scene, contrived ""need"" to terraform Earth despite the infinite planets accessible via the movie's hyperspace drive (see: contrived conflict between Zod and Kal El simply to justify combat action protracted event), redundant and unnecessary racial messaging, and inappropriate money hungry advertising, was great!If Director Snyder learns from his mistakes and keeps same actors for Clark and Lois with greater attention to the human component (the essence of science fiction) then I cannot wait for the sequel(s)!!!Henry Cavill and Amy Adams were so truly fantastic, however, that I have to grant 4 stars despite Snyder's questionable skills.",4,Man of Steel - Accolades to Cavill and Adams despite Snyder,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,2944,"['Man', 'SteelHenry', 'Cavill', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'Superman', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'Prologue', 'vignettes', 'Clark', 'saving', 'people', 'donning', 'suit', 'were', 'magnificent', 'as', 'well', 'heroic', 'self', 'discipline', 'not', 'abuse', 'powers', 'akin', 'newest', 'ie', 'best', 'rendition', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man', '2012', 'However', '20', 'minutes', 'wasted', 'time', 'fight', 'scene', 'simply', 'demonstrate', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'tedious', 'waste', 'time', 'akin', 'derailment', 'constituted', 'Transformers', '3', 'Inception', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'not', 'realize', 'action', 'fine', 'story', 'Eagle', 'Eye', 'A', 'believable', 'Superman', 'would', 'have', 'diverted', 'Zod', 'ocean', 'desert', 'away', 'urban', 'populace', 'minimize', 'risks', 'life', 'infrastructure', 'assets', 'want', 'story', 'not', 'crap', 'action', 'action', 'pointless', 'noncontributory.Also', 'America', 'whites', 'blacks', 'Asians', 'latinos', 'Normal', 'Americans', 'embrace', 'law', 'abiding', 'citizens', 'are', 'equal', 'Akin', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'boss', 'World', 'Wide', 'Z', 'being', 'black', 'Avengers', 're-written', 'make', 'Nick', 'Fury', 'black', 'President', '2nd', 'command', '2012', 'being', 'black', 'making', 'general', 'black', 'colonel', 'white', 'simultaneously', 'rewriting', 'comic', 'lore', '70+', 'years', 'make', 'Perry', 'White', 'black', 'insulting', 'Hollywood', 'pushes', 'agenda', 'cause', 'are', 'equal', 'Hollywood', 'truly', 'believed', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'pander', 'solicit', 'approval', 'black', 'actors', 'were', 'fantastic', 'incredibly', 'skilled', 'tire', 'unsolicited', 'Hollywood', 'repetative', 'agenda.Finally', 'encourage', 'viewers', 'embrace', 'one', 'year', 'boycott', 'distracting', 'advertising', 'movies', 'WE', 'PAY', 'TO', 'VIEW', 'paying', 'advertising', 'midst', 'movies', 'insulting', 'viewer', 'detracts', 'continuity', 'enjoying', 'film', 'IHOP', 'was', 'advertised', 'no', 'less', '3', 'times', 'movie', 'Sears', 'was', 'distinctly', 'advertised', 'once', 'camera', 'fixated', 'Sears', 'logo', 'one', 'year', '6/22/13', 'viewing', 'will', 'refuse', 'enter', 'IHOP', 'Sears', 'such', 'companies', 'realize', 'submitting', 'maximizing', 'Hollywood', 'profits', 'will', 'minimize', 'own', 'profits', 'consensus', 'public', 'boycott', 'can', 'teach', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'sacrifice', 'story', 'line', 'intrusive', 'inappropriate', 'advertising.In', 'conclusion', 'Man', 'Steel', 'one', 'wasteful', 'protracted', 'action', 'fight', 'scene', 'contrived', 'need', 'terraform', 'Earth', 'infinite', 'planets', 'accessible', 'movie', 'hyperspace', 'drive', 'see', 'contrived', 'conflict', 'Zod', 'Kal', 'El', 'simply', 'justify', 'combat', 'action', 'protracted', 'event', 'redundant', 'unnecessary', 'racial', 'messaging', 'inappropriate', 'money', 'hungry', 'advertising', 'was', 'great', 'Director', 'Snyder', 'mistakes', 'keeps', 'same', 'actors', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'greater', 'attention', 'human', 'component', 'essence', 'science', 'fiction', 'then', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'sequel', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'were', 'so', 'truly', 'fantastic', 'however', 'have', 'grant', '4', 'stars', 'Snyder', 'questionable', 'skills']",N/A
1561197,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B008JFUPFI,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[2, 7]","Man of Steel is, technically, the first movie reboot of the Superman mythos since 1978's Superman: The Movie. Produced by the Christopher Nolan, written by David Goyer and directed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen), it's an attempt to bring the moral ambiguity and 'grittiness' of Nolan and Goyer's Dark Knight trilogy of Batman films to the Superman franchise, and set up a new shared universe of films based on DC comics characters.Things start promisingly with a visit to Krypton, depicted as something between Avatar (the Cameron movie) and Dune, with a mixture of ultra-advanced technology and feuding nobles. Russell Crowe plays Jor-El, here depicted as a scientist trying to save his world from imminent destruction but, in typical Russell Crowe style, is also capable of laying waste to entire platoons of soldiers single-handedly. Crow runs afoul of Michael Shannon's General Zod during a coup but still manages to blast his infant son (eventually a capable and reasonably good Henry Cavill) into space before the planet explodes. Zod and his cohorts are sentenced to eternal imprisonment in the Phantom Zone, which works out about as well as it ever does.The infant Kal-El arrives on Earth and is found and raised by Kent family near Smallville, Kansas. Kal-El aka Clark's crazy powers and abilities soon manifest and his human parents (ably played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) are soon spending their time running around quashing rumours that their son is a space alien and instilling him with noble human values. Clark attempts to lie low in a number of fairly innocuous jobs but his tendency to rush into dangerous situations to rescue people soon attracts the attention of a reporter, Lois Lane (Amy Adams). Clark discovers a Kryptonian ship which he can use with technology from his own crashed vessel to create an interactive AI based on his father's personality. This allows him to learn about his heritage, but also sends out an automated SOS which lures Zod and his crazy crew to the planet. Cue a lot of carnage as showdown follows showdown until the film climaxes.The storyline is, in principle, a good idea. The film avoids any mention of Lex Luthor or Kryptonite, and the use of Krypton, Zod and Jor-El as an AI are all good notions that give the story a personal investment for Superman whilst allowing the origin story part of the narrative to flow into the actual present-day storyline. Unfortunately, this doesn't work out in practise. The film's first hour, just under half the total running time, is overwhelmed by backstory and exposition. The Krypton sequences with Russell Crowe are pretty good, with a strong visual identity and Crowe - easily the best performer in the movie - doing some excellent work, grounding the fantastical landscapes and events in more relatable issues of family. Michael Shannon is a bit thuggish and lacking in nuance as Zod (especially as the film goes on and he gets more shouty), but he has credible motivations and presence. The Krypton sequence is imaginative and involving, but also overlong.Once on Earth, the film becomes a confused morass of flashbacks (many of them pretty pointless) and present-day story. Kevin Costner is very good as Superman's human father, right up until he gets what is, by a considerable distance, the stupidest, most pointless and most unconvincing death scene in the history of cinema. The overwhelming stupidity of this sequence, not to mention that it was completely unnecessary, may be the film's lowest point. Some individual sequences such as Superman saving the crew of an oil rig or learning to fly by first jumping really high (a nod to early versions of the character who couldn't fly at all, only jump miles at a time) are much more successful. Amy Adams's Lois Lane, who soon enters the story, is also really good. She plays Lois as a smart, intelligent reporter in her thirties who is more plausible than other takes on the character. Crucially, she is also aware of who Superman is from the off. This is an obviously different take on the character relationship, avoiding the whole 'wears glasses as a disguse' cliche, even if it makes no sense whatsoever (Perry meets Superman but later falls for the old 'glasses' trick hook, line and sinker). But still, points for trying on that score. More disappointing is that Adams and Cavill don't really have much chemistry, and their eventual romance is utterly unconvincing.The film continues to try hard to succeed: Zod's plans for Earth are actually somewhat logical and make sense. They also give hope to Clark that one day Krypton can live again, which should lead to greater moral confusion over what is the right thing to do. But this never happens: Clark decides early on to defend Earth no matter the cost and never budges from that, making these attempts to complicate things fail outright.This leads into the film's climactic action sequences which are, on the whole, highly disappointing. The action sequences are over-indulgent and seem to go on forever. They also frequently lack context or conviction: seeing two invulnerable beings fight one another knowing they can't hurt one another makes for zero tension. The CGI is also flat-out terrible in these battles, rather bafflingly since Krypton is so impressive at the start of the film. The character-replacement CGI is unconvincing, the placing of the actors' faces on CGI bodies is amateurish and some of the flight and movement CGI is worse than the twelve-year-old original Spider-Man movie. Usually in 2013 the very least you can say about an otherwise terrible movie is that the effects are good, but Man of Steel can't even manage that right. The final battle also indulges in some dubiously lingering shots of collapsing skyscrapers with hundreds of people in them (or about to be squashed by them) which makes for uneasy viewing in a Superman feature.Man of Steel (**) shows hints of a fertile imagination and originality (mostly in the opening act set on Krypton) whilst showcasing a few good performances, but these are soon buried by inane dialogue, terrible action sequences, poor CGI and a total collapse in logic at several key points in the film. Man of Steel is not only not very good, but even manages to make Superman Returns look like a capable and competent film in comparison. Overall, not recommended.",2,Terrible effects and pacing ruin some promising performances,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,6344,"['Man', 'Steel', 'technically', 'first', 'movie', 'reboot', 'Superman',

1561204,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B008JFUPFI,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[15, 34]","We seem to be living in an age where writers/producers/directors of big summer movies, especially superhero movies, want so badly to jump on the ""super gritty, realistic, real world"" fad of the last several years, that they make movies that the audiences have to endure until the end, instead of being entertained by and filled with joy and excitement by the end. This being the 2010s (or whatever you want to call it), it seems uncool for these movies (and other things) to have that sense of awe and wonder and pure popcorn joy that going to these movies used to have. Now, it has to be super realistic, gritty, angsty, etc. To be in the real world. Well, I live in the real world, and I want to go to these movies, especially a ""Superman"" movie, to get away from reality for 2 hours. Needless to say, I was not a fan of the movie, despite some excellent work. When I first heard of the movie and the people involved, I feared for what it might be. And that's what it turned out to be.The story, such as it is, deals with a lot of the backstory/origin of Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman. I don't want to say too much or go into anything at length here about the movie, but we all get the gist. There is a battle on Krypton and Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sends his only son, Kal-El, on a ship to earth. We see through flashbacks (in a jarring and out of touch style) how Clark was raised by the Kents ( the strong Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, in the only parts of the movie that seem to have anything resembling heart and warmth) in Smallville. About an hour in, Clark dons the famous suit (but don't you dare utter the name 'Superman'), and General Zod (Michael Shannon) comes a calling, looking for something that Jor-El had shipped with Kal-El to earth. It then boils down to a battle royale that, at first impressive, becomes repetitive and as hollow and clinical as the worst ""Transformers"" movie. I don't want to say much more than the basics. Leave the rest to you actually seeing it.Henry Cavill certainly looks good in the part and can fill out the suit nicely, but that's about it. His Super-, uh, I mean, his Kal-El is pretty robotic and one note, not showing much of any emotion other than sour and seriousness. None of the appealing charm or wit is here. Out of all the actors to play the role on film or TV ( I have personally been through 5 previously), Cavill's is the least likeable and relatable, with a cold distachment to boot. Writer David Goyer says he wanted to make Superman more realistic and in the real world. So, that means cold and joyless? Everything that is Superman, that has made him the character for all these years, is stripped away. They want to make him relatable, but I found it more relatable in any given episode of ""Smallville"". There isn't much to say about the rest of the cast either. They all do what they can with the material, but really, this movie belongs to the action and CGI. There isn't enough material for Amy Adams' Lois Lane for her to bring anything to the role other than just showing up. The chemistry between the two is also non-existent. Hopefully, the expected sequel will atually give this wonderful actress a real part, and amp up the romance and chemistry, which is pretty much a cold fish here. Shannon as Zod is insane, but also way over the top.  I guess shouting makes you real evil. The only ones here I thought did a real portrayal were Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as the Kents. Those are the best moments of the movie, and one would of wished the whole movie was with them in Smallville.There is action a plenty in the massive destruction/overly CGI way that it gets to the point of being ""been there, done that"". It just becomes two super powerful guys slamming into each other and buildings. It gets old fast and loses any and all impact. Sublety and nuance is not something Zack Snyder seems to strive for here....or ever, really. It's a noisy movie that is noisy for the sake of being noisy. The loud music doesn't help. Composer Hans Zimmer is a wonderful artist. He has done a lot of good work, but there is nothing here. It's just typical action movie music to go along with the noise on screen. Honestly, I am having a hard time even remembering the music now.In the end, ""The Man Of Steel"" is a very modern superhero movie in the Christopher Nolan mold. Super serious and dark because, as you know, life is serious and dark with no joy or happiness, at least according to Nolan and Goyer. It's a style that has grown rapidly old. It's gotten to the point where it doesn't seem much fun to be the hero anymore or to watch them. Can't we have a Superman movie that is relatable and fun but without all the seriousness? Is that really too much to ask? Can't we have fun? Oh, that's right. I forgot. It's the modern age where that kind of thing is frowned upon. A soulless, joyless, noise machine that Michael Bay could direct in his sleep. It truly appears that the party is over.",2,"""S"" Stands For Squandered",1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,4953,"['seem', 'be', 'living', 'age', 'where', 'writers/producers/directors', 'big', 'summer', 'movies', 'especially', 'superhero', 'movies', 'want', 'so', 'badly', 'jump', 'super', 'gritty', 'realistic', 'real', 'world', 'fad', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'make', 'movies', 'audiences', 'have', 'endure', 'end', 'instead', 'being', 'entertained', 'filled', 'joy', 'excitement', 'end', 'being', '2010s', 'want', 'call', 'uncool', 'movies', 'other', 'things', 'have', 'sense', 'awe', 'wonder', 'pure', 'popcorn', 'joy', 'going', 'movies', 'used', 'have', 'Now', 'be', 'super', 'realistic', 'gritty', 'angsty', 'etc', 'be', 'real', 'world', 'Well', 'live', 'real', 'world', 'want', 'go', 'movies', 'especially', 'Superman', 'movie', 'get', 'away', 'reality', '2', 'hours', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'not', 'fan', 'movie', 'excellent', 'work', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'people', 'involved', 'feared', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be.The', 'story', 'such', 'deals', 'lot', 'backstory/origin', 'Kal-El/Clark', 'Kent/Superman', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'go', 'anything', 'length', 'here', 'movie', 'get', 'gist', 'battle', 'Krypton', 'Jor-El', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'only', 'son', 'Kal-El', 'ship', 'earth', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'jarring', 'touch', 'style', 'how', 'Clark', 'was', 'raised', 'Kents', 'strong', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'only', 'parts', 'movie', 'seem', 'have', 'anything', 'resembling', 'heart', 'warmth', 'Smallville', 'hour', 'Clark', 'famous', 'suit', 'do', ""n't"", 'dare', 'name', ""'Superman"", 'General', 'Zod', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'calling', 'looking', 'something', 'Jor-El', 'had', 'shipped', 'Kal-El', 'earth', 'then', 'down', 'battle', 'royale', 'first', 'impressive', 'repetitive', 'hollow', 'clinical', 'worst', 'Transformers', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'basics', 'Leave', 'rest', 'actually', 'seeing', 'it.Henry', 'Cavill', 'certainly', 'good', 'part', 'can', 'fill', 'out', 'suit', 'nicely', 'Super-', 'uh', 'mean', 'Kal-El', 'pretty', 'robotic', 'one', 'note', 'not', 'showing', 'much', 'emotion', 'other', 'sour', 'seriousness', 'None', 'appealing', 'charm', 'wit', 'here', 'actors', 'play', 'role', 'film', 'TV', 'have', 'personally', 'been', '5', 'previously', 'Cavill', 'least', 'likeable', 'relatable', 'cold', 'distachment', 'boot', 'Writer', 'David', 'Goyer', 'wanted', 'make', 'Superman', 'more', 'realistic', 'real', 'world', 'So', 'cold', 'joyless', 'Everything', 'Superman', 'made', 'character', 'years', 'stripped', 'away', 'want', 'make', 'relatable', 'found', 'more', 'relatable', 'given', 'episode', 'Smallville', ""n't"", 'much', 'say', 'rest', 'cast', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'material', 'really', 'movie', 'action', 'CGI', ""n't"", 'enough', 'material', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'bring', 'anything', 'role', 'other', 'just', 'showing', 'up', 'chemistry', 'two', 'also', 'non-existent', 'Hopefully', 'expected', 'sequel', 'will', 'atually', 'give', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'real', 'part', 'amp', 'up', 'romance', 'chemistry', 'pretty', 'much', 'cold', 'fish', 'here', 'Shannon', 'Zod', 'insane', 'also', 'way', 'top', 'guess', 'shouting', 'real', 'evil', 'only', 'ones', 'here', 'thought', 'did', 'real', 'portrayal', 'were', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Kents', 'are', 'best', 'moments', 'movie', 'one', 'would', 'wished', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'Smallville.There', 'action', 'plenty', 'massive', 'destruction/overly', 'CGI', 'way', 'point', 'being', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'just', 'two', 'super', 'powerful', 'guys', 'slamming', 'other', 'buildings', 'old', 'fast', 'impact', 'Sublety', 'nuance', 'not', 'something', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'strive', 'here', '.or', 'ever', 'really', 'noisy', 'movie', 'noisy', 'sake', 'being', 'noisy', 'loud', 'music', ""n't"", 'help', 'Composer', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'wonderful', 'artist', 'done', 'lot', 'good', 'work', 'nothing', 'here', 'just', 'typical', 'action', 'movie', 'music', 'go', 'along', 'noise', 'screen', 'Honestly', 'am', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'even', 'remembering', 'music', 'end', 'Man', 'Steel', 'very', 'modern', 'superhero', 'movie', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'mold', 'Super', 'serious', 'dark', 'because', 'know', 'life', 'serious', 'dark', 'joy', 'happiness', 'least', 'according', 'Nolan', 'Goyer', 'style', 'grown', 'rapidly', 'old', 'gotten', 'point', 'where', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'fun', 'be', 'hero', 'anymore', 'watch', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Superman', 'movie', 'relatable', 'fun', 'seriousness', 'really', 'too', 'much', 'ask', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'fun', 'Oh', 'right', 'forgot', 'modern', 'age', 'where', 'kind', 'thing', 'frowned', 'soulless', 'joyless', 'noise', 'machine', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'could', 'direct', 'sleep', 'truly', 'party']",N/A

1561210,A11PRT1CCVHB52,B008JFUPFI,"B. Daniel ""ComicBOOK Lover""","[3, 7]","Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"" is a divisive movie among fans. Much like Christopher Nolan's swan song for ""The Dark Knight Trilogy,"" it has caused quite a stir either being loved or hated, there are few who are in the middle. I am personally of the mind that it was a great modernization of the character and his mythos much the way both ""Batman Begins,"" and ""Amazing Spiderman"" took the stories we know and added some reality and humanization to them. Say what you want about the film though, it was a complete success for WB/DC/Legendary and has set a fire under DC's that has them scrambling to capture some of that shared universal goodness that Marvel has been riding for almost a decade now.  What I am giving here is my personal opinion on what was well done, and the much debated destruction of Metropolis and killing of Zod.Let's start with the stuff that most people will agree with:Krypton: The opening of the film was absolutely fantastic. This was a real world and it showed in every detail. From the landscape to the science and politics, Krypton felt more real than any other iteration I'd seen on screen. Also the little time we spent with the characters while still on planet really helped sell the relationships later on, and set up the drama as well. I wish there had been more, and I would love to see some flashbacks when we get the next solo sequel, and they could easily set up Supergirl in that flashback as well.The Cast: The cast of the movie truly elevated it to great heights to me. Starting with Henry Cavil who you believe as the outsider that just wants to help, he embodied a version of Clark Kent we hadn't seen before on the big screen. On that same note, Amy Adams played a no-nonsense Lois Lane, who would never be fooled by a pair of glasses. Her investigative skills bring her right to the doorstep of the man of steel, showing she's more than a damsel in distress. Michael Shannon could've chewed scenery all film after seeing his performance in ""Premium Rush,"" but instead we got a nuanced, thinking man's performance. His reasoning was completely understandable and though he was vicious you feel for his plight. Laurence Fishburn was a great and inspired choice for Perry White, and I only wish they had given him more to do, and Antje Traue was a great right hand for Shannon, beautiful and ruthless. But it was Russell Crowe's Jor-El and Kevin Costner's Johnathan Kent that really stood out for me, as they exemplified the duality of the lessons they were teaching Clark/Kal. Diane Lane should not be forgotten as she was still Clark's anchor and she definitely played a great Martha Kent.Modern Superman: This is definitely a new take on Superman. Closer to many of the recent modern takes seen in comics and on ""Smallville,"" here we have a Clark who is unsure of himself, and his place in the world, he wanders the country and the world simply trying to get by and figure himself out, but can't fight his nature to help people in need. This Clark was a real person that we see, not a caricature of a person so goofy people won't look twice at him.  Clark is Superman and they established that by having him not be the Clark we all know until the end, and even then he's just a normal guy, not a bumbling fool. And once he does figure out his place he embraces it wholeheartedly. And that's the beginning of the Superman we all love.The Suit: The movie rested on how Cavil looked in the suit and he fit it perfectly. Starting by building an impressive physique to go under the suit, Cavil and Snyder wanted real muscle not padded musculature for this new Superman to feel like he really could lift a car above his head. The design of the suit itself is a testament to the dedication to detail. The suit looks alien, and yet it still looks classic. Sure it's missing the underoos but it still says Superman when you see it. The use of the CGI cape was awesome as it allowed for some truly iconic poses.Flight and Fight: So for the longest time, and I mean as long as I can remember fans have wanted to see Superman truly let loose onscreen. We finally got that here, and though the reactions to it will be discussed later in the debated section I wanted to mention it here as well. THIS is what a Superman fight should look like! I mean the man can toss cars around like  we do balls, so the action NEEDS to be on an insane level. Not just relegated to lifting heavy stuff, and throwing it the fights were kinetic, and destructive as a fight of that magnitude would be. I remember watching ""Superman: Doomsday"" and saying ""Now that's what I'm talking about!!"" this was truly what I as a fan had been waiting for. Then there was the flying, and yes I know it comes first in the film but we had seen flying before. Christopher Reeve made us truly believe a man could fly! And Neo did a damned fine job in the last two Matrix films, and Iron Man has made flying just look cool and fun. But here we get the true feeling of speed that Superman has as well. It's not that he's soaring through the sky or weaving in and out of mountains it's the visceral feeling of speed as things blur around him, and the unbridled joy Clark is experiencing when he flies. I think it was actually a great move to have him learn how to fly so late in life, it allows the audience to experience it with him as well as show that even though he is used to having abilities he can still take pleasure in things like flight.Military Involvement: Much like Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" franchise MoS chose to highlight the alien aspect of Superman's origin, and in doing so to touch on the phobias that humanity has towards things they don't understand. This film is very much a first contact story in that the world reacts to aliens with fear more than awe and curiosity. Granted had Superman come out to the world before Zod appeared threatening Earth, things may have gone different, but not much. The military involvement is proof of that. From the moment there was a possibility of a threat to national security the Military was involved, and this is shown from the fact that it's not until AFTER the battle of Smallville that they consider Superman and ally. The whole battle they are firing indiscriminately at the Kryptonians, including Superman. Xenophobia is a major part of this film, and the military is pretty much the embodiment of that in the film.Easter Eggs: From a Wayne Enterprises satellite, to several LexCorp objects, to even lesser known references, Man of Steel was chalk full of goodies for long time fans to find. Hell you can Google them at this point they've been pointed out so much. I won't list them here but there are quite a few, some of which are pretty fun, like the ""Keep Calm and Call Batman"" sign in the bank during the Smallville battle.THE DEBATED!!!!!Herein lies the topics that are still being debated to this day about the film. Mind you these are my opinions. I state none of this as fact and am writing simply to start discussions. Please no hate messages or telling me how stupid I am. I'm a sensitive individual!!Pa Kent: First of all I want to start with the fact that everyone is complaining about the part from the trailer where Pa Kent's response to a young Clark's question of ""What was I supposed to do? Let everyone die?"" was ""Maybe."" It took a second viewing of the film to get the whole idea of what I think they were trying to do with Pa Kent. That scene, or any of the scenes with Pa Kent can't be taken as stand alone, and they really work best as part of the entire film. Taken as a whole, the lesson that was attempting to be taught to Clark isn't one of shame, or hiding, or cowardice or anything like that. He was simply a father trying to protect his son. He wasn't saying not to help, but to do it as secretly as possible, until he is ready to stand before the world. At first I thought he was trying to tell him to wait until the world was ready for him, but that would never happen. Perry White reiterates this when Lois tries to drop the story basically echoing what Jonathan Kent believed; that the world would react out of fear towards him. Jonathan knows his son and knows that it's not in him to not help people. Lois sees this too. It's anonymity that Jonathan wants for Clark, until he is ready for what will come. He wants him to understand that human nature is to fear what they don't understand and that for every grateful person there will be more that want to exploit or hurt him because they fear him, and that puts everyone else at risk, and he has to think about the bigger picture. I know a lot of people feel it's not a good lesson, but it's the one that makes sense for the world today. Besides the fact that the lesson from the original Superman film, that there are just some things you can't change was COMPLETELY lost on Superman in that film, as he reverses time to save Lois. So he didn't learn a damned thing from Pa Kent's death in that. As a matter of fact Superman 2 had another instance of him making a decision and not having to live with it when he gave up his powers, easily rectified by a glowing green crystal, and this actually leads into the next issue of debate.Superman Kills Zod: In 1988 Superman was forced to execute not one but three Kryptonian criminals from a parallel dimension, in Superman #22, which took place after the ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" event that rebooted the DCU for the 80's. But this wasn't Zod's first death. No, Superman killed Zod for the first time in the classic Superman 2 film. YUP! Sure he didn't snap Zod's neck, but letting him drop to a bottomless pit isn't much better. And again three died that day. No one thinks about it because it was a non violent end, but they weren't in a floating piece of mirror anymore. Plus even if the pit isn't bottomless, they were powerless so they either froze to death in pain or jus broke their necks or something. Real humanitarian that is. In Man of Steel we get a serious internal struggle over what to do as you see it on Clark's face. And that death at his hands, the last of his kind, a former friend to his father and the cause of so many deaths in the city will haunt him forever. And THAT bring us to the Superman with the no kill rule. Also it brings us to the final debated topic.Destruction of Metropolis: So people wanted a great Superman fight but they were unhappy with the level of destruction caused by said fights. Well um, sorry it's called collateral damage. Am I a cold callous individual? No! I'm a realist. Plus this is entertainment. That kind aof level of fight does not happen without some buildings and part of the city damaged. I mean watch any comic cartoon with large scale battles. ""Superman:Doomsday"" is an example, ""Justice League and JL: Unlimited"" are other good examples. The only difference is that there were actually people shown running for cover and such during the battle on MoS. This to me just gave a sense of realism. The city didn't just get magically evacuated when trouble started. Also many people have said ""Why didn't Superman just take the fight out of the city?"" And how do you suppose he did that? Ask Zod politely to take it to an abandoned desert or something? Run away and hope Zod followed? Yeah not with the Black Zero above Metropolis, and not while he had to take out the World Engine over the INDIAN OCEAN!!!  Yes he flew round the world in a few minutes to get back to Metropolis. And my personal favorite ""Why didn't he try and save people in Metropolis?"" When? While he was fighting Zod? Or While he was trying to destroy the World Engine? My point is he did everything he could to minimize damage by stopping the threat. Simple as that.I love to plays Devil's Advocate and try and defend bad movies. But this isn't a bad movie at all. I loved it. It was a modern retelling of a classic and modern myth. I really though all the changes made sense and were made organically. This was a great way to start their shared universe and I look forward to seeing what they come up with",5,Modern Man of Steel,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,12033,"['Zack', 'Snyder', 'Man', 'Steel',

When it comes to almost any superhero film there is always drama across the internet because you have varying factions that, when taken as a whole, never will like anything that comes out.  It's either too sanitized so it will appeal to a wider audience, or the character isn't exactly as it appeared in print, or character interactions or back story don't mesh exactly as they have before.  While I can appreciate super fans know a ton about their favorite characters, the general public (in my opinion) just doesn't care that much about the small stuff.  This is why some are frequently disappointed with what is otherwise a great movie, as is the case with the new Superman: Man of Steel.

1561223,A1H9F6VOJ55DBM,B008JFUPFI,"Beth Smith ""FilmSeeker""","[1, 3]","I got this movie because I'm a Superman fan in general.  I have liked Superman since I was a kid and watched the George Reeves syndicated serials in the 70's and 80's.  I bought comic books and watched the Christopher Reeve movies, and Superman Returns with Brandon Routh a few years back.  I never really watched Lois and Clark or Smallville though, but still enjoyed them from time to time, but let's just say, I am comfortable with Superman.However there are some things about this movie that bugged me.  While it was pretty good in regards to fight scenes, special effects, etc....it jumped around in flashback mode too much.  I would be watching the movie and getting into it then suddenly you'd see Clark as a boy again.  The movie would have been better off staying linear instead of flashing back as it made the story confusing in so doing.  We see him being jettisoned off to earth then suddenly he's a grown man of 33, rescuing guys on an oil rig, with no explanation of how he got there.  We see his dad's grave before we see how his dad died.Also, if you are expecting this film to be somewhat canonical  here are a few spoilers for you.Lois Lane knows Clark Kent is an &#34;alien&#34; from the get go, and his identity isn't really a secret to many other people either.  By the time he goes to work as that &#34;mild mannered reporter&#34; only Lois knows.Any other versions I have seen, Jonathan Kent died from a heart attack but in this film, he's sucked up by a tornado.I think in the originals, if I am not mistaken, Kryptonians are good guys.  But it would seem in this movie, Kal El (Superman) is in this good vs. evil battle with his own people and with the human beings he was sent to live among.  He also doesn't like the idea that he's an alien in the first place.A lot of the scenes where Zod is creating destruction looks too close to the destruction on 9-11 for comfort as well.For visual effects and a twist on the storyline, this is an OK movie.  But for the origins of Superman, there are better ones out there.

I'm a girl, so I had my Wonder Woman, but I had Spiderman and my favorite right after Wonder Woman was Superman.  But I was never a purist when it came to comic books.  We had a local books store that my parents and I visited weekly that I would take my foot thick stack of comic books down to, to trade for new ones to read.  Eventually I moved on to reading novels - but I never lost my love of super heroesWhen Man of Steel came out I was a little hesitant.  To me Christopher Reeves had been THE Superman.  I did like Dean Cain as the TV Superman and I enjoy that series. (yes, I did watch George Reeves too)  But to me, it seems that it would be really hard to fill Christopher Reeves shoes.  It always will be, but man-o-man-o-man one look at Henry Cavill with his hairy chest, his body on fire, framed in that door, set to rescue those guys on the oil rig, really caught my attention. (note to guys, one thing that many women find very appealing about guys like Henry Cavill and Hugh Jackman is that well built hair chest - shaved chests aren't always sexy)Okay, hormones on the back burner.  I really like the intensity of this movie.  There was a very dark vibe to Cavill's Superman and I understood it.  It had to be tough growing up being so different, being bullied and not able to defend yourself.  I really didn't like Costners' reply when Clark asked him &#34;should I just have let them all die&#34; and he replies, &#34;yes, maybe, I don't know&#34;.  That was WRONG.  That is not the values that the original Kents raised Clark Kent with.And how Clark's father died was extremely upsetting to me.  First being the year on the tomb stone was the year that my own father died, I will not expand on that.  The tornado was too much for me.  My family is from Texas, right on the tornado belt and I'm am deathly afraid of tornadoes.  I've been thru way too many of them - imagine being woken up as a 7 year old from a dead sleep, yanked out of bed by your father and carried at a dead run for a storm cellar.  The cellar is small, filled with more than 10 people, 1 big bed, lots of preserves and other types of items folks on farms keep in storm cellars and the entire time the grannies are praying.  I had to stop the video and go take a walk outside.But moving on - you can see why this movie was stirring a lot of emotions for me - first part of the movie was much more detailed than the original movies and I caught an interesting detail.  That the family's name was actually El.  For all these years I had thought Superman's first name was Kal-el, when in fact that was his full name.  Funny thing is my husband's name is Jorel, but it is a German name, where the J is pronounced with a Y sound....we have joked over the years about this.  People always say, &#34;oh, like Superman's Dad's name&#34; - Now he can say, &#34;no, his dad's first name was Jor&#34;Also seeing all the babies in the bubbles didn't make sense at first until I listened to General Zod rant later in the movie - then it dawned on me why he was so driven.  I knew that Jor-El and Lor-El had conceived and birth the first natural born child against their societies laws from the first part of the movie, but I didn't realize WHY it was against the law.  With Zod's rant it became clear that while the babies were growing and maturing in their little bubbles they were being &#34;programed&#34; to fit into society within a specific job.  Zod for example was bred to be a warrior, it was hard coded into his genes to look after and protect Kyronite citizens.  With all the citizens dead, he had an over whelming drive that verged on madness to jump start the race again so that he could full fill his purpose in life.  He was willing to do anything to see his plan thru, his genetics had too strong of a pull and drive, forcing him to go over the top.As for the violence during the fights that happened between Superman, Zod and his people - it was rather shocking.  Usually Superman would have tried to lure the enemy away to a place that didn't have human population or building to fight.  I was rather surprised that he didn't use that technique, but HEY, it's a movie - most of it was CG.  In the end the way that he killed Zod, I didn't buy it.  All that fighting, punching, slamming, etc and he simply snaps his neck?  First he should not have been able to snap his neck - Zod's skeletal structure should have withstood it.But did it upset me to see Superman kill, yes and no.  Some reviews have said that Superman has always been held up as the ultimate Boy Scout and that is true.  He has always kept in mind that his strength is much greater than those of us on earth and never killed a human enemy.  But in the case of Zod, he wasn't human, so I pretty much look at it like this - All Bets Were Off.  The only way to stop Zod and his people were to kill them, because their genetics would have driven them to continue their efforts and there would have never been peace.I do highly recommend this movie.  If you pay close attention it might give you some things to think about after the fact.  Or you can just enjoy it for what it is.",5,This film had me thinking about it several days after I watched it,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,5231,"['**some', 'mild', 'spoilers**Growing', 'up', '70',

There are some movies that are timeless (star wars), and other that, to me, just come off cheesy and reek of the time period they were made in. I guess it comes down to taste. I know others who are staunch fans of the Reeve Superman films and I wouldn't try to convince them otherwise. They just never appealed to me.I loved this movie. I loved Henry Cavill as Superman, and the story IMO was very involved and a bit darker to match today's taste. The special effects were top notch, Amy Adams was adorable as Lois Lane, and I really enjoyed Kevin Costner and Russel Crowe as Kal El/Clark's two fathers. Michael Shannon was a great villain who had motivation for what he was doing, something I often find lacking in these super hero movies. The villain often has some lame reason for chasing our hero, but here it was justified. I saw it in IMAX 3D and was amazed, especially at the final showdown.I guess it depends on your taste-there were some older people in the theater I was in who left-there is A LOT of violence/fighting in the last 1/3 of the movie, so if you are looking for the innocent comic book fare of the old movies this might not be for you.

Sometimes we can over analyze a movie and all of it's underpinnings to death. Whether it's in popular media or the world of sports our society loves ""to build someone (or something) up, and we love to tear it down."" Second guessing is now a cottage industry.Certain things sometimes just need to be less-conditionally enjoyed. And I have to say that I enjoyed this movie immensely. (I would have enjoyed it more had I witnessed it at the theaters but I wasn't able to view it until this past week when it was released to DVD.) I found it interesting and entertaining on so many levels. To me it was like having ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" all rolled into one viewing.I saw an article that read ""Is This the Best Superman Movie Ever""?  It is always comical and somewhat frustrating when humans start to contemplate matters in this mode. We do it with so much....music, movies, sports...just to cite a few examples. ""Is the read-option going to revolutionize the NFL?"" And ""Are the Beatles really just elevator muzak?"" (MS-R.E.M.) Sometimes some of us slip into heresy.Why does there need to be a determination as to whether this Superman movie is the best ever? (Beyond, of course, the ravenous appetite of the 24/7 media and its proclivity to assuage its hunger through creative journalism.) I read that the director Zack Snyder explained something to the effect of ""finding the version of Superman that speaks to this generation."" And I feel that he succeeded in this wonderfully. I was very moved by the subtle gravity to the answer that Jonathon (Kevin Costner) Kent gave a young troubled Clark when he asked ""What was I supposed to do....let them die?"" For me, this reality also perfectly rationalized the finale.I have heard grumblings over Superman's attire. Did we want the bold red & blue that were originally patterned after the costumes of circus strongman attire? And how then does that reconcile with the need today for everything to be dark, real and ""edgy""? The explanation for the ""S"" symbol was excellent.And the worthy performance by Michael Shannon (Boardwalk Empire) as General Zod. No longer is he a one dimensional psycho power hungry to the point of genocide. Now there is a much more complex explanation bordering on delusional ""anti-hero"".I have heard complaints over the high-speed quantum destruction that takes place when Superman & General Zod go ""mano y mano"". While watching the movie it took a moment for me to get used to this and then it made perfect sense. Here is a superhero that is so powerful he can reverse time by flying counter-clockwise to the earth's rotation. (Ugh!) Or simply hold back a crumbing ocean oil rig. I did get an eerie feeling watching these unfolding images that had such a surrealistic similarity to the gulf oil spill and the destruction of the World Trade Centers.One of the biggest problems with the Superman mythos is how do you have an entity that is so immensely powerful yet still have vulnerabilities? I thought this was yet another critical aspect that was handled so well in this film.So before I become victim to my own burgeoning micro analysis let me finish by saying that I truly enjoyed this movie, one of the better ones I have viewed this past year, and congratulations and much appreciation to Snyder, Nolan, and all the rest of the MOS creative cabal.",5,"""Are The Beatles Really Just Elevator Muzac?""",1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,3519,"['What', 'can', 'say', '824', 'reviewers', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'said', 'therein', 'problems', 'have', 'towards', 'complaints', 'have', 'seen', 'described', 'here', 'Sometimes', 'can', 'over', 'analyze', 'movie', 'underpinnings', 'death', 'popular', 'media', 'world', 'sports', 'society', 'build', 'someone', 'something', 'up', 'love', 'tear', 'down', 'Second', 'guessing', 'now', 'cottage', 'industry.Certain', 'things', 'sometimes', 'just', 'need', 'be', 'less-conditionally', 'enjoyed', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'immensely', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'had', 'witnessed', 'theaters', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'view', 'past', 'week', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'found', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'was', 'having', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'rolled', 'one', 'viewing.I', 'saw', 'article', 'read', 'Best', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'Ever', 'always', 'comical', 'somewhat', 'frustrating', 'when', 'humans', 'start', 'contemplate', 'matters', 'mode', 'do', 'so', 'much', '.music', 'movies', 'sports', 'just', 'cite', 'few', 'examples', 'read-option', 'going', 'revolutionize', 'NFL', 'Are', 'Beatles', 'really', 'just', 'elevator', 'muzak', 'MS-R.E.M', 'Sometimes', 'slip', 'heresy.Why', 'there', 'need', 'be', 'determination', 'Superman', 'movie', 'best', 'ever', 'Beyond', 'course', 'ravenous', 'appetite', '24/7', 'media', 'proclivity', 'assuage', 'hunger', 'creative', 'journalism', 'read', 'director', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'explained', 'something', 'effect', 'finding', 'version', 'Superman', 'generation', 'feel', 'succeeded', 'wonderfully', 'was', 'very', 'moved', 'subtle', 'gravity', 'answer', 'Jonathon', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Kent', 'gave', 'young', 'troubled', 'Clark', 'when', 'asked', 'What', 'was', 'supposed', 'do', '.let', 'die', 'reality', 'also', 'perfectly', 'rationalized', 'finale.I', 'have', 'heard', 'grumblings', 'Superman', 'attire', 'Did', 'want', 'bold', 'red', 'blue', 'were', 'originally', 'patterned', 'costumes', 'circus', 'strongman', 'attire', 'how', 'then', 'reconcile', 'need', 'today', 'everything', 'be', 'dark', 'real', 'edgy', 'explanation', 'S', 'symbol', 'was', 'excellent.And', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'General', 'Zod', 'No', 'longer', 'one', 'dimensional', 'psycho', 'power', 'hungry', 'point', 'genocide', 'Now', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'explanation', 'bordering', 'delusional', 'anti-hero', '.I', 'have', 'heard', 'complaints', 'high-speed', 'quantum', 'destruction', 'place', 'when', 'Superman', 'General', 'Zod', 'go', 'mano', 'y', 'mano', 'watching', 'movie', 'took', 'moment', 'get', 'used', 'then', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'Here', 'superhero', 'so', 'powerful', 'can', 'reverse', 'time', 'flying', 'counter-clockwise', 'earth', 'rotation', 'simply', 'hold', 'back', 'crumbing', 'ocean', 'oil', 'rig', 'did', 'get', 'eerie', 'feeling', 'watching', 'unfolding', 'images', 'had', 'surrealistic', 'similarity', 'gulf', 'oil', 'spill', 'destruction', 'World', 'Trade', 'Centers.One', 'biggest', 'problems', 'Superman', 'mythos', 'how', 'do', 'have', 'entity', 'so', 'immensely', 'powerful', 'yet', 'still', 'have', 'vulnerabilities', 'thought', 'was', 'yet', 'critical', 'aspect', 'was', 'handled', 'so', 'well', 'film.So', 'become', 'victim', 'own', 'burgeoning', 'micro', 'analysis', 'let', 'finish', 'saying', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'have', 'viewed', 'past', 'year', 'congratulations', 'much', 'appreciation', 'Snyder', 'Nolan', 'rest', 'MOS', 'creative', 'cabal']",N/A
1561255,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B008JFUPFI,Brent Butler,"[18, 28]","Superman was one of the very early comic books I enjoyed as a young kid, and I've read those comics for decades. I haven't always liked the changes they've put the character through, but nothing I had reservations about in his comic book portrayals disappointed me in the manner this movie did.First, very little about this movie and virtually nothing about the character spoke out to me as being Superman. Henry Cavill's portrayal of our single favorite super strong, super fast, invulnerable hero was almost devoid of emotion. Even his brief and infrequent outbursts of anguish seemed forced, and that was virtually the only emotion the writers or director allowed him to show. I just didn't get ""I'm Superman"" out of this performance in any way. Yes, he was brave. Big deal.Amy Adams as Lois Lane was OK, but brought little life and only a dab of the spunk to the role that we've watched over and over again from Margo Kidder's performance. It's as if the direction was afraid to ""go big"" with the acting in a genre that demands its characters be very, very big.Laurence Fishburne was wasted, as Perry White's scenes in the film were throw away moments that really added nothing to the story or the atmosphere of the film. If they had been completely cut you'd never have noticed them missing.And that's just the acting ... when I start discussing the story decisions thing go downhill in a hurry:1. As a Superman ""traditionalist"" I didn't get having Lois Lane track the mysterious super-alien back to his roots with an over-simplistic and hardly detailed investigation that took her directly to the Kent farm. This is not a spoiler, as this happens early in the film and you can see it coming a mile away.2. The entire sub-plot about her desire to have an expose on an alien presence in the form of a super being on Earth had some interesting potential but in the end was just a throw away story element. More on that later.3. These writers decided to follow the course of many on having Jonathan Kent die. The manner of his death, especially vis a vis Kal-El as his adopted son, was a complete disconnect for me from the possibility of this character being Superman. It was supposed to provide some deeper psychological underpinning for this Superman story, but it was merely ill thought and useless.4. Having Superman's relationship with ""Earth"" transition from moving from a suspected alien threat to a friend and savior was horribly bungled. It was an idea. It just wasn't an idea these writers could competently plot.5. Turning the end of the movie into an extended battle pretty much resulting in the destruction of Metropolis (sorry if that's a spoiler) was a decision made for the purpose of having a special effects spectacular with what the writers/director hoped would be shock value. Sorry, that's been done. And in this context it made little sense and by logic hampers the story. At the time this happens, ""Superman"" is completely unknown to the public Even with General Zod's public announcement, this is not a character known, trusted, or beloved by the public. The virtual destruction of Metropolis, in which he participated even as he tried to stop it, would leave pretty much everyone resentful and suspicious of this being. From either the standpoint of logic OR emotion, it just doesn't work.6. As I promised, back to Lois' expose: That could have been a really interesting element of a Superman introduction if handled with any subtlety or intelligence at all. If it had been the main theme of the movie and been well written, it could (and probably should) have carried the film. Yet the moment Zod shows up with his announcement, ALL of the effort put into that sub-plot became completely wasted. It is obvious that the creators of this story had many ideas, didn't have the skill or talent to boil them down to a few that would work well together, and just jumbled everything they thought might be ""cool"" into one extended, illogical mess that had little to do with a satisfying ""Superman Origin"" story.7. Then at the end, we have Clark Kent merrily showing up for work as a reporter at the Daily Planet (where of course Lois already knows his secret!). But how? When? With the damage and evident loss of at least tens of thousands of lives, Metropolis would have had to be essentially abandoned as a toxic environmental nightmare, not to mention graveyard ... and that included extensive damage to the Daily Planet Building itself that likely would have taken years of repair, if it was even deemed structurally to be salvageable!It's like this film was written by clueless 20-somethings with no idea of even the most simple practical results of the events they were so proud of. These writers seem like the kind of people you'd see Jay Leno quizzing on the street and finding incapable of locating Canada on a map of North America. LOLThere is more but this review is long enough.Suffice it to say that if this movie is at some point in the future playing on one channel, and Christopher Reeve's Superman of 1978 happens to be playing on another at the same time, I'll be watching the 1978 version. This film simply has none of the charm, humor or life of the first series. In fact, the much lambasted ""Superman Returns"" had a far more convincing and embraceable story than this film.I've always been a DC fan over Marvel, but Marvel and who they choose to work with in films is flat-out putting the DC portrayals to shame. Comparing this film to ""The Avengers"" leaves ""Man of Steel"" looking as flat as a pancake. It's very sad, as I was really looking forward to the prospect of an excellent new Superman movie.To finish with a technical note, the special effects are well executed. In my opinion 3D is wasted, just get the regular Blu ray if you must see this. Nothing about the 3D stood out to me at all in the frequent jumble of wreckage presented in this film.I was often annoyed by the decisions to go with a ""pushed"" look for most of the film (especially the flashbacks) that often left scenes looking grainy and washed out. It was a stylistic choice that didn't work for me as a viewer.Whether you enjoy the CGI effects and scenes or not, nothing about the excellent technical presentation can make up for the ineptitude of the plotting or writing.I was looking forward to this film a lot. In the end I cannot recommend it whatsoever. I will try out the sequel and see if they do better, and hope that I can completely forget this one and pretend that the next one is first in the reboot sequence. If they can't get the next one right, that will be the last of this series I watch, if it even survives the next installment.",2,I really thought I was going to like this film ...

Nowadays, it's not enough to have an action movie; in order to humanize a comic book icon it's important but to give the hero a strong sense of introspection, a psychological neediness. MAN OF STEEL lands somewhere in between: it's the story of a man who is not quite a superstar, and a hero who is not quite ready for prime time.Directed by Zack Snyder, MoS achieves its greatest successes in the first half of the film, having wisely decided to condense our hero's upbringing into only those certain new elements. Most already know the overall story: born on a crumbling Krypton doomed by overzealous energy demands, the infant Kal-El is sent to Earth by his scientist parents, Jor-El and Lara (Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer). Whereas other films have concentrated on our super tadpole's upbringing by Kansan farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), who instill in him humble middle-American values, MAN OF STEEL chooses not to relate any more of his story than is necessary to develop the plot. It's a wise move that makes the movie less top heavy, leaving us to glean only those elements necessary to this incarnation - it's only a shame they didn't follow this practice at the end, too.  More on that later.Henry Cavill is an interesting choice for Superman - the first non-American to play the part, he projects almost the opposite image in each of his personages. While I found him to be a virile, bold Clark - as comfortable holding up collapsing derricks as he is lifting buses - he projected a smiling calm as Superman, fitting in the suit as if his highly pumped pecs and abs were born to it...which, as it turns out, they were.  He's certainly credible as Superman, but I found him to be more interesting as Clark; that is, the pre-Superman Clark, when there was no disguise to dilute him. As Clark he was troubled, searching, and three-dimensional, and not only in the pay-four-extra-dollars-for-your-ticket kind. He seemed to lose that dimension when he divided himself: like a lobotomized patient, he was only half as interesting anymore.Yet still, the movie is compelling and enjoyable...certainly more enjoyable thanSuperman Returns, the Bryan Singer-directed movie starring Brandon Routh, I found myself liking MAN OF STEEL even while it tried to wow us with action scenes at the end that were a little too dependent upon the same stunts done endlessly: I mean, how many times do we have to see them knock each other through buildings?I don't know if the problem with the movie's third act was solely Superman's; I liked the concept behind a world having to come to term with this new alien in their midst. But there was simply something missing once they did so: having accepted Superman, it seemed the drama was replaced by bad guys, super-fisticuffs and exploding buildings.You see, our bad guys this time around are General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his fellow renegades, who led a revolt against Jor-El and the council because of their foolish raping of the planet's natural resources (sound familiar, anyone?). Banished to the Phantom Zone until Krypton's explosion frees them, they spend the next three decades searching for Kal-El, whom they believed to carry enough coded genetic information to re-animate their race. They decide to use Earth as a giant nursery upon which to recreate their species, wiping out all existing humans in the process.Part of the problem was that their conclusion chose the weakest elements of their story to promote. For instance, right from the beginning I thought General Zod's rebellion had legs; certainly, the council's actions DID destroy their planet...but now that Krypton was no more, his plan to destroy our race was simply too easy to dislike; their hope to recruit Kal-El/Clark could have have been interesting if they hadn't made Shannon's Zod so one-dimensional and unlikeable. Kal/Clark had spent the whole early film trying to find out why he was, in effect, a freak...couldn't Zod and his ilk have given him a more compelling choice to make in this regard? Shannon's a terrific actor - seeTake Shelterif you have any doubt. He would have quite ably handled a better script.Another problem for me - a BIG one - concerned a late-movie decision Superman was forced to make; it should have been more psychologically difficult for him, and other than a mighty shout the issue was over. Nothing more. This should have been another area of EXTREME importance to the myth, yet it was passed over like toppings on a pizza.These things said, I enjoyed the movie overall. Snyder has directed his movie capably, lending itself a proper air of fresh excitement. Indeed, there was even a sense of discovery here, and a palpable feeling of true franchise value. There were several Easter Eggs for the observant: LexCorp was written on the side of several trucks, and there was at least one mention of Wayne Enterprises. And the movie always kept a sense of fun: as Superman is sent crashing into a just-constructed wall, the OSHA sign there drops the 1 and 6 from ""106 Days Without an Accident,"" leaving just the 0. And there's a sign in a soda shop proclaiming ""Go Smallville Spartans."" The tie-in? One of Zack Snyder's previous films was...300. Go Spartans, indeed.While there were a few weak choices in writing, there were some particularly interesting ones concerning Lois. Ably acted by Amy Adams (check that alliteration!), she was no femme fatale, but a capable and loyal partner of not only Superman but also Clark the Reporter. While she needed a rescue now and then, she is the most capable Lois I've seen since Noel Neill, back in the days of black and white television of my youth. She not only gives the series a smart compass, but she will also likely serve as a ""sidekick,"" given this movie's script. I do believe that the core of this enterprise is a solid one, capable of leading the franchise onward. Other than those misplaced early steps, it looks like the movie is on solid footing.",4,"Some Weak Points, But The Franchise Lives On",1372032000,"06 24, 2013",2013,6105,"['much', 'like', 'MAN', 'OF',

Their talents were wasted in this flick. The script was poor and the storyline didn't make sense. Did anyone who produced this movie read the Superman comic books? One of the main parts of the original comic that makes Superman fascinating is the fact that no one knows who Superman is, particularly Lois Lane. The Clark Kent alter ego makes the story interesting. Instead they make Clark out to be some drifter with no purpose in life. What nonsense!!Also, what made the original Superman movie (and other big budget films of the 70s like Star Wars and Close Encounters) was that less is actually more. Its time for Hollywood to get off its CGI addiction and get back to simple, down to earth special effects. Back then, the production effort was spent on characters, storyline and special effects. These days its all about the visual graphics and not about the story. Its a direction for disaster.

Even Elektra and Daredevil. That being said, I can watch X-Men Origins Wolverine, but I really dislike that movie. I love the Avengers, and in my opinion Man of Steel was a lot better than Avengers. The formula for Avengers was awesome but predictable. World needs heroes, heroes clash, heroes make up, heroes save the world. And while Man of Steel and Avengers are two different types of movies, the formula for man of Steel made things unpredictable. MoS was gritty, sort of dark, with alot of destruction that would come from gods fighting on Earth.Many people complained about the death and destruction in Mos. I say this, it was realistic. Superman had just learned who he was and then his ancestors descend on Earth. A ship full of Supermen and women. I know when watching a Justice League cartoon, and we see Superman punch someone through buildings, we all have said, I wish a Superman movie could be like that. Well, now we have it.People complained about the ending. What Superman did. If you don't know, you will and it will be amazing. And when you do see it, try to understand that this is the first event in Superman's life were he is faced with anything. He makes mistakes just like a young Batman would, only when Superman makes mistakes, buildings are flattened and millions die. AS his life progresses, I bet he will adopt a personality much like the Superman we all know and love.People found plot holes, well not so much plot holes, just scientific inaccuracies. Like Lois falling from a black hole when everything around her is being sucked in. And there was this machine that the military had to transport, but people were up in arms saying, why couldn't Superman do it for them?

1561271,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B008JFUPFI,California Dreaming,"[2, 4]","I watched &#34;The Amazing Spider Man&#34; awhile back, and I found it neither amazing nor about a man.  And forget about the spider even.  I really thought that that film was a huge misfire, and for the life of me I couldn't figure out why they rebooted that series.  Oh, that's right; I know why.  They just wanted to trap more of your money in a web of lies.  For the second time.  At any rate, my title for that review was &#34;Boot the Reboot,&#34; which to me usually holds.But this series is different.  First of all, the &#34;original&#34; with Christopher Reeves -- there were surely Superman films before that -- was made over 30 years ago.  Naturally, special effects have vastly improved over that time frame, while in the Spiderman series, the films were made so close together in time that those effects didn't improve much.  And times have surely changed; we're not really fighting the Russians nowadays (or perhaps we still are?)  So I'm not sure that the subject matter of the Reeves films necessarily fit into the Zeitgeist of our day.But most importantly, I believe that Henry Cavill is a huge improvement over Mr. Reeves.  Yes, I know that the latter died tragically quite a few years ago, and yes, I know that the first sentence of this paragraph will upset some people.  But the truth is the truth, and Mr. Cavill doesn't come across as being cheesy here; he seems to be a &#34;super man&#34; if you will.  And I also found the Amy Adams casting a huge upgrade too; sorry to you Margot Kidder fans out there (and I'm not really one of them).  And finally, throwing Russell Crowe into the mix always adds to the story.Without giving away much plot, I also liked how the writers changed the story up here a bit.  The whole Clark-Kent-is-the-mild-mannered-journalist-thing is gone.  Sure, he's a little bit too much of a pacifist for my taste, but overall, you know that he will eventually come around, kick some tail and take some names.  That's what Superman does.  And I did like how they made the overall look and feel of this film darker than the original, while not taking that darkness too far.Surprisingly, almost a five for me.  In reality, because of the genre -- I'm not really a fan to tell you the truth of superhero flicks -- I almost should go five because it's so much better than most of these films.  I'll go with a pretty big recommendation here, and I'll change my mind about the general case to boot:  maybe we shouldn't boot the reboot, after all.",4,Maybe Don't Boot the Reboot. . . .,1396828800,"04 7, 2014",2014,2488,"['watched', '34', 'Amazing', 'Spider', 'Man', '34', 'awhile', 'back', 'found', 'amazing', 'man', 'forget', 'spider', 'even', 'really', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'huge', 'misfire', 'life', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'rebooted', 'series', 'Oh', 'right', 'know', 'why', 'just', 'wanted', 'trap', 'more', 'money', 'web', 'lies', 'second', 'time', 'rate', 'title', 'review', 'was', '34', 'Boot', 'Reboot', '34', 'usually', 'holds.But', 'series', 'different', 'First', 'all', '34', 'original', '34', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'were', 'surely', 'Superman', 'films', 'was', 'made', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'Naturally', 'special', 'effects', 'have', 'vastly', 'improved', 'time', 'frame', 'Spiderman', 'series', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'so', 'close', 'together', 'time', 'effects', 'did', ""n't"", 'improve', 'much', 'times', 'have', 'surely', 'changed', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'fighting', 'Russians', 'nowadays', 'perhaps', 'still', 'are', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'subject', 'matter', 'Reeves', 'films', 'necessarily', 'fit', 'Zeitgeist', 'day.But', 'most', 'importantly', 'believe', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'huge', 'improvement', 'Mr.', 'Reeves', 'Yes', 'know', 'latter', 'died', 'tragically', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'yes', 'know', 'first', 'sentence', 'paragraph', 'will', 'upset', 'people', 'truth', 'truth', 'Mr.', 'Cavill', ""n't"", 'come', 'being', 'cheesy', 'here', 'be', '34', 'super', 'man', '34', 'will', 'also', 'found', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'casting', 'huge', 'upgrade', 'too', 'sorry', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'fans', 'out', 'there', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'one', 'finally', 'throwing', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'mix', 'always', 'story.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'much', 'plot', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'writers', 'changed', 'story', 'up', 'here', 'bit', 'whole', 'Clark-Kent-is-the-mild-mannered-journalist-thing', 'gone', 'Sure', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'pacifist', 'taste', 'overall', 'know', 'will', 'eventually', 'come', 'kick', 'tail', 'take', 'names', 'what', 'Superman', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'made', 'overall', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'darker', 'original', 'not', 'taking', 'darkness', 'too', 'far.Surprisingly', 'almost', 'five', 'reality', 'genre', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'fan', 'tell', 'truth', 'superhero', 'flicks', 'almost', 'should', 'go', 'five', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'films', ""'ll"", 'go', 'pretty', 'big', 'recommendation', 'here', ""'ll"", 'change', 'mind', 'general', 'case', 'boot', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'boot', 'reboot']",N/A

1561287,A3MU9G6YWKTGTA,B008JFUPFI,Cary L. Brown,"[4, 8]","I really, really wanted to see this at the theaters, but missed it (due to some...  logistical concerns?) so I only got to see the film, for the very first time, this last weekend.  I was hopeful, but cautious...  who would know if it would be any good?I avoided the reviews, until after I'd seen it, and then read the ""rotten tomatoes"" reviews on the film.  I find myself wondering what film some of these people were watching, and whether or not the reviewers have any idea what they're talking about.  It seems that most of them refer to the 1979 movie as ""the source material"" and have no idea that the character of Superman has been around a LOT longer than that, and that the character has been played by many, many different actors, not just the late Christopher Reeve.I knew, the moment I first saw the actor in-character, though, that they'd finally gotten the casting RIGHT.  I've liked various actors at various times to various degrees, but I'd never seen any of them who looked like the character in the books, until now.  Henry Cavill is, in my personal opinion, the single best casting choice for this character yet, and I find it hard to believe that there will be a better one to follow.So...  the film starts, and we get Krypton.  Not the Krypton from the 1979 movie, but an amalgam of different Kryptons from the history of the character.  We see the ""organic, grown technology aspect,"" we get the floating drones (taken almost without alteration from the 1980s comic book reboot, by the same title as this film, ""The Man of Steel""), but we also get the ""pulp sci-fi"" elements of the older versions of Krypton as well...  including the once-ever-present ""flying beasts"" and so forth.Many, many reviewers recoiled with horror from this sequence... not because it's not faithful to the source material, and not because it's not ""good storytelling,"" but simply because it's ""not big white crystal spires with Marlon Brando in white"" just redressed.  So, let's be clear... THE KRYPTON IN THE MOVIE IS CLOSER TO THE SOURCE MATERIAL VERSION THAN THE VERSION SEEN IN THE 1979 FILM!  Got it, folks?The film, wisely, skips over the ""chronological origin story"" since we all, pretty much, know that the Kents found Kal-L, named him ""Clark,"" and raised him as their son.  We're not pounded over the head with a repeat of the full ""Clark growing up backstory"" but we are shown enough to tell the (rare) newcomer pretty much what's going on, without just rehashing old territory.We are shown General Zod...  but, unlike the (forgive the term) ""Cartoon villain"" Zod we've seen previously, we get a character who actually is not (at least in his own eyes) the ""bad guy.""  There is no doubt, in this film... Zod sees himself as the hero.. the savior of his race.What a refreshing thing to see in a film...  a ""bad guy"" who actually has a real motivation, real emotions which we, as the audience, can relate to.  Isn't it almost shocking to see a ""villain"" who becomes the villain because, in some twisted way, he's trying to ""do good?""  I LOVED this.  It was so, so much more satisfying than another ""mustachio-twirling guy"" (through granted, I still love the cartoonish villains from the 1979 film in their own way)We didn't get a full backstory for Clark... instead, we ""discover"" key moments in his past through flashbacks.  It works very well, because it's in no way ""contrived.""  We see scenes we KNOW are important, not because the producers are showing them to us, but because the CHARACTER is showing them to us...  it makes a difference in terms of the impact of each scene.There are stumbles, of course.  I found the ""death of Jonathan Kent"" to be really, really badly handled.  I get what they were trying to do...  show us that Jonathan Kent was more concerned with hiding Clark's nature than with anything else.  But...  I'm sorry, it was just SILLY.  Why not have Jonathan carry the child, and have Clark run back to get the dog?  (I mean, Clark would be faster...  and a LOT stronger...  and would have a far better chance of success.  And even if he had to use ""super power"" in some way, with the tornado behind him most people would not really notice, or would attribute it to their imagination!)I also didn't like how obvious it is, now, where Superman hails from.  Surely SOMEONE would stop to ask ""why did the Kryptonians attack Smallville, Kansas?""  Especially now that it's known that Superman ""grew up in Kansas.""  Martha, expect to see some visitors in black helicopters coming your way soon!I liked the ""wandering to find my way"" bit...  which, by the way, IS canonical, depending on which version of Superman you're talking about (Clark didn't necessarily go straight from Smallville High to the Daily Planet).  I realize some people will find this derivative of the scenes at the beginning of ""Batman Begins"" but the ""derivation"" of this far, far predates that...  read some Joseph Campbell, for his discussion of the ""hero's journey"" which always involves some period of self-exploration and even self-denial.I will admit that I was surprised to see Lois learning about Clark's identity before he worked at the Planet, but I'm OK with that.  And I liked the portrayal of Lois Lane, though I must admit, the actress playing her was... to my mind...  fairly ""generic,"" and easily replaceable.  (I actually think that the best Lois to date is Erica Durance, from the series ""Smallville."")The final conflict-stage of the film showed a LOT of violence and devastation...  and the action was non-stop.  This could have been toned down, a bit, I think...  the CGI effects went over the top...  but this was more consistent with what we see in the comic books than you might think.  (I just hope that Superman takes an active hand in the reconstruction, or it'll take many decades... after all, we've still yet to see a completed replacement for the World Trade Center!)The biggest compliant from ""serious"" Superman fans is the end of the final battle sequence...  where Superman kills.  But I find that to be a truly sad complaint, showing a lack of grasp of reality (an odd statement to make in relation to a ""comic book movie"" I suppose).  IN REAL LIFE, there are situations when there's simply no option.  You can try to ""make peace"" but sometimes, if the other guy is unwilling to make peace with YOU, you have no choice but to knock him down, and make sure he can't get back up again.  In this case, Zod was trying to continue to murder people...  personally, no less (the tens of thousands of dead from his ""technological attacks"" previously would, to his mind, be collateral damage, not ""murder"" per-se) and there was NO WAY that you could restrain him, imprison him, or otherwise make him stop... other than simply stopping him, permanently.By killing Zod, Superman saved hundreds of millions, if not six billion, human lives.  A heavy price to pay, but one that a TRUE HERO would have to pay (side note - this is an ongoing discussion in ""Batman"" circles...  is Batman actually responsible for all the deaths caused by The Joker, since had Batman simply killed the Joker early on, none of those people would have died?)The end of the film... apparently after a major reconstruction effort in Metropolis (and maybe it was the ongoing help in reconstruction which results in Superman becoming, nominally, headquartered in Metropolis rather than, say, New York or Los Angeles or Chicago)...  we find ourselves with the ""status quo"" we all expect to see...  Clark Kent as reporter at the Daily Planet, working with Lois Lane.  Any future films in this ""cycle"" will feel much more... familiar?...  to the casual fan.There is NO LEX LUTHOR in this film...  but there are signs aplenty of the presence of ""LexCorp,"" as well as several small references to ""Wayne Enterprises"" and ""Ferris Aircraft,"" among others... showing that this film takes place in a larger DC Comics universe.And it's being talked about now that the sequel to this film will likely involve some other characters...  Batman and Wonder Woman, very likely (who MAY have even been seen in this film, in a much-debated point), along with Green Lantern.  Maybe we'll even see Green Arrow or some of the other characters come along, in ""realistic"" forms.You see, DC has taken note of the success of ""The Avengers"" and the ""whole Marvel Universe"" approach...  and they're unlikely to let this go.What you see in this film is the origin story of Superman...  in a way you've never seen before.It's not a ""darker"" story...  but it's not CAMP.  It's perhaps the first fully SERIOUS take on the Superman concept (Smallville, the series, was pretty serious at times, but was a bit too ""soap opera-ish"" to really count, in my opinion... and all the other versions were light-hearted, non-serious approaches).This is a Superman who exists in a world which we can recognize, with rules we can recognize...  and people who act like real people, not like ""cartoon characters.""I, for one, have been waiting to see this for a very long time.  And this film, a few minor flaws aside, delivers what I was looking for!EDIT:  As a side note, I strongly recommend the following (I have it as an audiobook) to give you a better vision of Krypton.  The Krypton as seen in this film is really very consistent with this book...***************Last Days Krypton Kevin Anderson*****************",5,Best Superman Film Yet Made (warning - spoilers

First there are the comic marvel fans somewhat brainless praising the nonsense in the Iron man, Thor, & Captain America films ( not to almost mention everything but the first 2 X-men & Spiderman 2 ) and hating the Nolan Batman films. Green Lantern sure. But the question is, what would happen if aliens very superior in all ways to us landed on Earth.  We're not talking the weak ones in the Avengers who it seems anyone could beat if you watch the Widow, Hawkeye & Cap to a degree in action. We're talking very powerful beings who in reality only one could destroy the planet. If you accept that then you have one of the most thrilling movies in which one decent powerful man from space battles 3 ( more if the rest had joined in ) crazed equally give or take powerful beings. This isn't the playtime in Superman 2. It turns into everyone on earth needs to die unless they are stopped.  Superman doesn't have the ability to keep destruction or death from happening while in battle with foes who have the same power. Green lantern might be able to place a blanket force field over a area for a while, while getting his brains kicked in.  Without a doubt the best movie based on a comic book character to this point. The only other to debate are the Batman's.  The movie has emotion, in fact it has everything. Points to remember are that the movie explains why everything that happens, happens. Compare the amount of destruction in the Avengers ending to Superman ( could have been a few minutes shorter but extender version early ). You would be glad that you lived in the Superman movie then the Avengers because Superman would have beaten those aliens in not even half the time, while the Avengers would be down to how long will Hulk last after Thor is finished.

1561302,A2O39VY1UEDCKH,B008JFUPFI,Charles Jannuzi,"[4, 15]","This review is based on seeing the film (last night) in the theater and does not review or rate the DVD and/or Blu-ray or other digital release.MOS isn't the worst superhero film I've ever seen, but it is something of a disappointment. It actually has a lot of the same issues that Superman Returns had--that is, what to keep from the comics and the Reeves films vs. what to do differently, plus story bloat.The choices that get put up on the screen in MOS leave me shaking my head. There were so many things done well and yet so many things aggravatingly awful. I think where it really goes wrong is in what is supposed to be the exciting climax vs. Zod.I like Henry Cavill as Supes, but I think he would make an even better Wolverine. Brandon Routh looked better as Superman in SR's version of the updated tights, in my opinion. Cavill looks more like the guy from Twilight or something in a sculpted body suit (which he doesn't need because his body is so sculpted anyway).I'll give this a slight edge over Superman Returns. I thought SR had more satisfying moments and was more visually interesting in terms of giving us the world in which Superman is supposed to exist. But the homage to the first two SM films got tiring, and Lex Luthor as the ultimate villain is too under-motivated to take up so much film time. They should have spent more time with BR as CK and/or SM. And they should have made much more of his trip back to Krypton (stuff that was basically cut from the release).I know many fans will say MOS is more original--because it doesn't draw on the first two Reeve films at all. But visually it seems to recycle a lot of ideas from Dune, Aliens, Spielberg's War of the Worlds, Avatar, even Transformers (and that is not good), etc. The depiction of US military forces doing their thing, done to death in how many films anyway, is just tedious.I realize that films like SR and MOS are really huge collaborations, but as with the recent ST films, perhaps the producers and directors are bringing in TOO MANY different pieces and visual coherence suffers. It was supposed to be a more 'realistic' Superman, but instead what I saw was this very jarring shift from an intergalactic civilization (that would belong in Green Lantern) to a world that looked like it was filmed more cheaply than Smallville and then to a world that gets destroyed (seriously did Metropolis really look like a real city to anyone, even before it got levelled?).There just was no really believable social realism to the film (something for example Spielberg got so right in the first hour of War of the Worlds). It did look like he was walking around as a fugitive in the landscape where they filmed the last X-files film.Another strike against originality is just how much this film draws on Superman Returns--the use of flashbacks to childhood, holographic projections of the dead father, Christ-like imagery in presenting SM--and even in the climactic action of doing something really titanic and confusing with something going on in the ocean that was titanic and confusing, while his powers are being zapped.And then there is the implausibility of the story once you accept the fantasy reality scenario that is given you--basically the destruction of Krypton. I guess the writers (including Nolan?) subscribe to some sort of theory about civilization collapses, but why Krypton would need Earth and why it couldn't survive in all its previous colonies is beyond me.Might have worked better had they done a parallel story of two Kryptonians--Supes and Zod.

It begins on Krypton (sp?) and gives the audience a better understanding of Superman's origins. It actually made sense and didn't rely so much on ""comic book"" logic. It actually sounded plausible.  I'm not a comic book reader, but the stories behind some of these characters are so out there, I'm like ""Yeah, right."" Don't get me wrong. I have enjoyed most of the movies so far that have come from comics, so no hate comments PLEASE!  I watched the cartoons as a kid. I loved X-Men and Spiderman cartoons.

I never heard much about Iron Man, but the movies are now part of my favorites...Go RDJ!But I'm getting off the subject. I was impressed with Superman's back story. I liked the fact that he had a spiritual background that was brought prominently to the front. The hero is just an average person like anyone else who is searching for his identity. When he finds it, he has to make a choice.Henry Cavill does a pretty good job. But he was just big for no earthly reason! Well, they saved money on not having to pad the costume. I think anyone could've played Lois Lane the way Amy Adams portrayed her. And why was Laurence Fishburne in this movie at all? Did he need gas money for his jet or something? Kevin Costner was Kevin Costner, doesn't matter which movie. Loved Christopher Meloni! Ok I just like him because I liked his character on Law & Order so he can do no wrong.

I give the movie credit for the special effects and the perfectly buffed actor that plays the starring role (I am a heterosexual male so giving this guy credit for being so fit says a lot). The movie explodes into action soon after the credits are finished rolling. Russell Crowe and the opening cast grabbed and held my attention. After that the movie slows to a dead stop for far too long.- SPOILER ALERT BEYOND THIS POINT -I assume this was supposed to be the ""character development"" phase of the movie which was an epic fail in my view. They spent too much time on ensuring we saw the turmoil within Superman's soul due to unanswered questions. They did it via completely disjointed ""flash backs"" and ""flash forwards"". At any given moment you were either seeing his flashbacked turmoil as a child or as a flashback young adult. I just wanted to say ""I get it already! He has daddy issues!"". Yet the flash-back and flash-forward continued throughout the lion's share of the film. I did not see the need to spend an hour watching Superman search his soul via flash-backs and flash-forwards that seem too disconnected to waste energy keeping up with.He also was extremely moody and seemed ""super"" depressed. I wasn't sure if during one of the flash-back/forward segments if he was going to punch a hole through his adopted father as a child or run off into the woods crying as a young adult because the world was so mean. One bizarre seen is when he was a grown man working in some dive. A customer picked on a lady that also worked at the dive. Clark Kent approaches the guy and says something like ""I'm going to have to ask you to leave"". The guy stands there with attitude so I'm thinking he is going to throw a punch and hurt his hand or something. As I sat there an waited with bated breath thinking ""finally"", Clark Kent stands there for a few seconds, turns around, pouts, and runs out of the dive. Yet another good build up to absolutely nothing!!! It takes a loooooong time before he finally decides to stop pouting/brooding and takes action. You may as well go get some popcorn and stand in the lobby and text for an hour before anything noteworthy happens (after Krypton explodes). Walk out to the car and play some tunes for a while and then come back. You won't feel like you missed a thing because he will still be awash in disjointed segments of rage and self pity.The last fight scene went on far too long and it appears that Superman didn't give a crap about injury to civilians as he punches the villain through several skyscrapers filled with people. I'm also not sure why Zod was so hell bent on building a new Krypton on Earth??? He could have taken his planet scrubbing machine anywhere in the galaxy to do it. There was no incentive to kill all life on Earth when the terraforming machine could have done the same thing on an uninhabited planet. They even took the machine from a former colonized planet. Why not just rebuild Krypton there? Also, why did such an advanced race blow up their own planet via using too much energy? In the original version the sun explodes or some natural calamity kills Krypton. In this version the political leaders tapped into the core for energy knowing the planet would be destroyed in the end. They had colonized other worlds previous to that so why did they a) kill their own planet and b) stay there to die with it when they clearly had options??? I could see if their sun was exploding which would narrow the options quite a bit.Why was a Kryptonian ship buried in the ice on Earth for tens of thousands of years suggesting (at least to me) that humans are the descendants of Kryptonians? Did I miss something? I didn't see them explain why that ship was there waiting for Clark Kent to activate it 50 thousand years later or what have you. The writers only cared about fight scenes and Clark Kent's disjointed, never ending, deep seated flash-back/forward depression. I will say this was the best special effects effort for a superman movie that has ever been made. That does not undue the rest of the issues with this poorly written movie.The title should be changed from ""Man of Steel"" to ""Man Who Broods"". It is a shame because with the powers he has and his popular strength of character this Superman movie could have been so much more. I won't be buying this BlueRay like I often do with these types of movies.",2,This movie was terrible.

I truly couldn't be happier with this. What's  really great here is that this movie is unlike any Superman flick we've seen before with it's smartly grounded & modern approach that's a clear influence from Nolan & Goyer's successful Batman Trilogy yet their both very different movies. That said, Henry Cavill IS Superman & Amy Adams' Lois Lane is wonderfully re-imagined. Like Clarke's computer program father, this Lois Lane is more like an anchor for Superman throughout the movie as he battles Zod & his cold blooded militant minions who are also excellent in their H.R. Giger armor. In the opening scene, Krypton is wonderfully brought to life as it resembles some sort of primordial dark age meets Flash Gordon, & this was personally one of the real highlights of this movie. The action & awesome battles scenes are dazzling with special effects that are awesome to behold, & a real treat for fans. Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"" sets out to modernize Superman for a new movie going generation & the legions of comic book fans the world over. Personally, they've done just that. Maybe some purists will hate it but I would think most comic book fans would be most pleased with this latest take.

1561316,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B008JFUPFI,Chris Kennison,"[6, 12]","Okay folks... come down to EARTH. This is not the best superhero movie ever and if it is, than that means no other superhero movies had a story. The story is basic as it comes, we have Australian Kryptonians, a Superman who kills, the Air Force opening fire upon a Kansas town with civilians, boring delivery and 9.11 x 15 destruction at the end of the movie just because the creators found a new effect to use. Now... my review.My first and still lingering thought about watching ""Man of Steel"" for all of twenty minutes was the overwhelming excitement of watching the capabilities of today's technology. Regardless of what you think of big over the top action movies, when they are done properly, they are breathtaking. We are presently walking into and through a new generation of film that has taken movie experiences to a brand new level. With the addition of 3D, high definition and improvements in sound technology, movies such as ""Man of Steel"" can be realized at a level that previous Superman movies could not.That being said, there is also a fine line with that technology that movie makers are still fleshing out; still trying to figure out what is too much and what is not enough. For instance, the effect that showed Superman attacking villains or visa/versa into buildings was pretty cool and it were as if the creators thought so too; so much that they used it too much. Way too much. The ridiculous building destruction at the end of the film was cool once, maybe even twice, but to the extent they took it was not done with common sense or thought of HOW MANY PEOPLE DIED, but ""this is cool, lets keep doing it"". The destruction in the finale was laughable. Even if it can be explained, humans would not be so happy about the total desolation of nearly an entire city and catastrophic body count caused by this alien, regardless if he were good or not.I would also like to make one very important suggestion to future movie makers who are filming in 3D; shaky cam and 3D don't mix. Shaky camera is 95% of the time awful anyway.Despite the obvious praises and dissatisfaction with ""Man of Steel"" in a technological aspect, its greatest asset may just be its humanity. For once, an action or superhero movie did that part of their movie correctly. Yes, the film is drenched in explosions and destruction, but while they were introducing us to the `Super' of Clark Kent, aka Kal-El, they also introduce us to the man. This was the movies greatest asset. It wasn't the visuals or the ridiculous chaos that ensues toward the end that left a lasting impression on me, it was the connection that Clark Kent has with his parents, played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane.""Man of Steel"" is a good movie that was not without fault. The story arch that we are all familiar with moves quickly. Yet, while it succeeded mightily in realizing and portraying the powers of Superman and the personality of Superman, it took many liberties with the story and dragged boringly along with a somber delivery; as if this movie were a tragedy. Throw in dozens of illogical occurrences that I listed earlier and this movie can easily leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. The most unforgiving of those is hands down... an inexplicable boredom, despite everything going on.",3,a BETTER THAN AVERAGE movie,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,3268,"['Okay', 'folks', 'come', 'EARTH', 'not', 'best', 'superhero', 'movie', 'ever', 'other', 'superhero', 'movies', 'had', 'story', 'story', 'basic', 'have', 'Australian', 'Kryptonians', 'Superman', 'who', 'Air', 'Force', 'opening', 'fire', 'Kansas', 'town', 'civilians', 'boring', 'delivery', '9.11', 'x', '15', 'destruction', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'creators', 'found', 'new', 'effect', 'use', 'Now', 'review.My', 'first', 'still', 'lingering', 'thought', 'watching', 'Man', 'Steel', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'was', 'overwhelming', 'excitement', 'watching', 'capabilities', 'today', 'technology', 'Regardless', 'what', 'think', 'big', 'top', 'action', 'movies', 'when', 'are', 'done', 'properly', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'are', 'presently', 'walking', 'new', 'generation', 'film', 'taken', 'movie', 'brand', 'new', 'level', 'addition', '3D', 'high', 'definition', 'improvements', 'sound', 'technology', 'movies', 'such', 'Man', 'Steel', 'can', 'be', 'realized', 'level', 'previous', 'Superman', 'movies', 'could', 'not.That', 'being', 'said', 'also', 'fine', 'line', 'technology', 'movie', 'makers', 'are', 'still', 'fleshing', 'out', 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'not', 'enough', 'instance', 'effect', 'showed', 'Superman', 'attacking', 'villains', 'visa/versa', 'buildings', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'were', 'creators', 'thought', 'so', 'too', 'so', 'much', 'used', 'too', 'much', 'Way', 'too', 'much', 'ridiculous', 'building', 'destruction', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'cool', 'once', 'maybe', 'even', 'twice', 'extent', 'took', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'common', 'sense', 'thought', 'HOW', 'MANY', 'PEOPLE', 'DIED', 'cool', 'keep', 'doing', 'destruction', 'finale', 'was', 'laughable', 'Even', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'humans', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'happy', 'total', 'desolation', 'nearly', 'entire', 'city', 'catastrophic', 'body', 'count', 'caused', 'alien', 'regardless', 'were', 'good', 'not.I', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'make', 'one', 'very', 'important', 'suggestion', 'future', 'movie', 'makers', 'who', 'are', 'filming', '3D', 'shaky', 'cam', '3D', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'Shaky', 'camera', '95', '%', 'time', 'awful', 'anyway.Despite', 'obvious', 'praises', 'dissatisfaction', 'Man', 'Steel', 'technological', 'aspect', 'greatest', 'asset', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'humanity', 'once', 'action', 'superhero', 'movie', 'did', 'part', 'movie', 'correctly', 'Yes', 'film', 'drenched', 'explosions', 'destruction', 'were', 'introducing', 'Super', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'aka', 'Kal-El', 'also', 'introduce', 'man', 'was', 'movies', 'greatest', 'asset', 'was', ""n't"", 'visuals', 'ridiculous', 'chaos', 'end', 'left', 'lasting', 'impression', 'was', 'connection', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'parents', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Man', 'Steel', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'fault', 'story', 'arch', 'are', 'familiar', 'moves', 'quickly', 'succeeded', 'mightily', 'realizing', 'portraying', 'powers', 'Superman', 'personality', 'Superman', 'took', 'many', 'liberties', 'story', 'dragged', 'boringly', 'along', 'somber', 'delivery', 'movie', 'were', 'tragedy', 'Throw', 'dozens', 'illogical', 'occurrences', 'listed', 'earlier', 'movie', 'can', 'easily', 'leave', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'most', 'unforgiving', 'hands', 'down', 'inexplicable', 'boredom', 'everything', 'going']",N/A

1561323,A286RTX7LFZSJQ,B008JFUPFI,Christopher Price,"[353, 490]","The ""Man of Steel"" movie is both action and plot heavy, dealing with complex spiritual issues as well as what it means to be human. On the other hand, the action is heavy-handed, with punches, bullets, and other weaponry being thrown at people on a regular basis. This combination of depth and intensity creates a powerful film, both visually as well as in theme. The performance of the story was breathtaking. As expected, the visuals were stunning; the special effects were phenomenally crisp and the scope of the camera was often wide, presenting the scenery itself as a spectacle. The acting was exceptional as well. Shannon's Zod was angry, driven, and resourceful, everything a good soldier is meant to be. His lines were powerful and his intentions and thoughts were practically visible on his face as he acted. Cavill's Superman also performed exceptionally. Each line was delivered with honesty to the character. His part was not really dialogue heavy, but his role was emotionally demanding, requiring sadness, fury, remorse, and empathy at various points in the film. His character is vulnerable and emotional, unsure of himself, which Cavill communicated well. Adams as Lois Lane was an interesting choice, and her role is not given as much screen time for development, but she did do a good job playing a driven reporter, dedicated to her work, even if it means bending the rules. It will be interesting to see where her character is taken in the next film (which is confirmed as a Batman/Superman movie according to news from Comic Con). The standout performances are definitely the two fathers, Costner and Crowe. The fathers, without giving anything away, are given numerous occasions where emotional scenes are required of them. Their sequences were powerful and convincing. I almost cried in the movie twice, and they were involved in them both. Their performances were moving.The story itself was the highlight for me. The story fearlessly stepped into religion, humanness, choice, evolution, and power, stepping out unscathed. There will be many who disagree with the film's presentation of the ideas, even I would disagree in places, but, by dealing with them, they gave the film depth. Also, besides philosophical depth, the movie's plot was gripping from the beginning and, overall, solid. The film revealed just enough of the plot to keep the audience informed and then continued, using flashbacks to catch the audience up as necessary. The plot had no real twists, but the plot was not necessarily predictable (I have not read the comics, but the comics could deal with the story. So, comic book fans could be familiar with the plot; I am not sure). The story was compelling, emotional, and relatable. This film ranks, in my opinion, as the best so far this year. The acting, story, and music were all great, giving the Man of Steel a five star return to the big screen.Acting: 4.7Plot: 4.8Overall: 4.74",5,Nolan Plot and Snyder Action Makes for the Best Movie This Year,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,2928,"['Man', 'Steel', 'movie', 'action', 'plot', 'heavy', 'dealing', 'complex', 'spiritual', 'issues', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'other', 'hand', 'action', 'heavy-handed', 'punches', 'bullets', 'other', 'weaponry', 'being', 'thrown', 'people', 'regular', 'basis', 'combination', 'depth', 'intensity', 'powerful', 'film', 'visually', 'as', 'well', 'theme', 'performance', 'story', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'expected', 'visuals', 'were', 'stunning', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'phenomenally', 'crisp', 'scope', 'camera', 'was', 'often', 'wide', 'presenting', 'scenery', 'spectacle', 'acting', 'was', 'exceptional', 'as', 'well', 'Shannon', 'Zod', 'was', 'angry', 'driven', 'resourceful', 'everything', 'good', 'soldier', 'meant', 'be', 'lines', 'were', 'powerful', 'intentions', 'thoughts', 'were', 'practically', 'visible', 'face', 'acted', 'Cavill', 'Superman', 'also', 'performed', 'exceptionally', 'line', 'was', 'delivered', 'honesty', 'character', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'dialogue', 'heavy', 'role', 'was', 'emotionally', 'demanding', 'requiring', 'sadness', 'fury', 'remorse', 'empathy', 'various', 'points', 'film', 'character', 'vulnerable', 'emotional', 'unsure', 'Cavill', 'communicated', 'well', 'Adams', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'was', 'interesting', 'choice', 'role', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'development', 'did', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'driven', 'reporter', 'dedicated', 'work', 'even', 'bending', 'rules', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'where', 'character', 'taken', 'next', 'film', 'confirmed', 'Batman/Superman', 'movie', 'according', 'news', 'Comic', 'Con', 'standout', 'performances', 'are', 'definitely', 'two', 'fathers', 'Costner', 'Crowe', 'fathers', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'are', 'given', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'where', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'are', 'required', 'sequences', 'were', 'powerful', 'convincing', 'almost', 'cried', 'movie', 'twice', 'were', 'involved', 'performances', 'were', 'moving.The', 'story', 'was', 'highlight', 'story', 'fearlessly', 'stepped', 'religion', 'humanness', 'choice', 'evolution', 'power', 'stepping', 'out', 'unscathed', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'who', 'disagree', 'film', 'presentation', 'ideas', 'even', 'would', 'disagree', 'places', 'dealing', 'gave', 'film', 'depth', 'Also', 'philosophical', 'depth', 'movie', 'plot', 'was', 'gripping', 'beginning', 'overall', 'solid', 'film', 'revealed', 'just', 'enough', 'plot', 'keep', 'audience', 'informed', 'then', 'continued', 'using', 'flashbacks', 'catch', 'audience', 'up', 'necessary', 'plot', 'had', 'real', 'twists', 'plot', 'was', 'not', 'necessarily', 'predictable', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'comics', 'comics', 'could', 'deal', 'story', 'So', 'comic', 'book', 'fans', 'could', 'be', 'familiar', 'plot', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'story', 'was', 'compelling', 'emotional', 'relatable', 'film', 'ranks', 'opinion', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'acting', 'story', 'music', 'were', 'great', 'giving', 'Man', 'Steel', 'five', 'star', 'return', 'big', 'screen.Acting', '4.7Plot', '4.8Overall', '4.74']",N/A

The 3D was decent but not totally necessary I'd be happy with 2D. Spoiler free review starts now.Ok I'm somebody who generally agrees with Rotten Tomatoes and their critics reviews of movies but this is one time gladly I do not ( Currently this movie since that 57% on Rotten Tomatoes which is insane to me). The Man of Steel is a great Superman movie I love it and to me it's 100 times better than Superman Returns (which ironically scored better on RT how I have no idea). While it's a movie that may have slight pacing problems in regards to the story I went into it just wanting the Superman movie that I think many of us have always wanted. I want to see Superman fighting enemies and saving people like the hero that he is. And I think this movie delivers on that front almost 100%. I see some people online complaining about the way they show Clark growing up in more flashback type scenes and then in the straight story line as a negative, and to me I find that sad. We really need to see Clark as a child learning about himself in a linear fashion most people know that story we've seen it, read it or even heard about it before. I think the way that was handled made the action start up much faster and made this movie enjoyable.Now again I'm somebody I like movies that show you the characters and talk about their pasts and give you reasons to love or hate them in his will he does a pretty decent job in the way it covers General Zod, Jonathan Kent and even Clark. I think Lois Lane could've used a little bit more back story but I think this would've slowed down the movies progression.One other thing I have a gripe about his sometimes the action is so fast-paced you can't quite tell what you're looking at and the shaky cam of people running is sometimes ridiculously shaky. But again it's Superman it's an action movie I can put up with that because watching him fly around and bash people and save the day is incredible.One thing to note there is no after the credits scene like in many other superhero movies that you need to wait for. I'm glad he knew that going in because sitting through this credit roll would take a while.And one thing I also liked there are a lot of little nods to the greater DC universe like Lex Corp. signs and even Wayne Enterprises. So if you're real comic fan or DC movie fan there's a lot a little nods that you're going to love to see. I think this movie is a great starting point for the Justice league movies that are certainly going to follow.So all in all if you go into Man of Steel expecting an exciting comic book movie, you're going to get so much more enjoyment out of it. I like to think it's not as much a character background type movie like The Dark Knight and not as much comic booky action as The Avengers I feel it was the perfect blend. It's definitely the Superman for a new generation and I think it does its job amiably.Thanks for reading be super man!PS Michael Shannon as General Zod was soooo good loved it!",5,It's the Superman I always wanted!!!

This latest rendition of superman is nothing short of superb. A colossal visual extravaganza of modern day technology, artistry and very strong story telling. The film begins very syfy, I was thinking ""Star Wars for several moments"" while watching the set up, but quickly turns into the comic hero, action adventure with lots of heart. The action sequences were bombastic and goosebump inducing. The fans who have been following the many editions and evolution of this superheroe saga will find this film a bit darker, more serious than previous versions.Unlike the final two renditions from the early eighties starring Christopher Reeve, thankfully there are no signs of this superhero ever going the comedic route. You may find that this Superman is pose to break many expectations specially from skeptics. Carrying the film with great elegance, character and charm and as a perfect fit is Henry Cavill. He conveys enough sensitivities to swoon the viewer yet he has all the powers it takes to crash through many buildings as he fights his nemesis General Zod and his bad guys from Krypton.The clever part of this story is that the bad guys are not the usual bad guys we have come expect, because they too have their purpose and noble agenda as well, so its not too difficult to empathize with their plight of survival. Their arrival onto earth is understandable. The stellar cast who accompany Cavill on this latest journey will leave you wanting an additional two to five hours more of ""Man of Steel"". But fear not, clocking in at almost two hours and a half you are sure to leave the theatre with your expectations fulfilled and you may very well treat yourself to repeated viewings if only to revisit the magnificence and scale of this spectacle. It is safe to say, this latest superman is so far the event film of 2013. The film you are not soon to forget. It's hair raising emotional content in conjunction with some very real and well done action sequences will keep both men and women coming back for more. The ending does a great job setting the tone for the upcoming sequels. Without question, this latest version of Superman brands Cavill into the hall of fame of superheroes and cements ""Man of Steel"" into a new, fresh longstanding franchise. 10/10Entertainment Film News review",5,"""Man of steel"" is simply superb.

1561329,ACJVGDN8G386P,B008JFUPFI,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[1, 3]","The main issue with the latest version of Superman via Christopher Nolan is whether audiences will buy into looking at Superman through a new lens; a lens which takes the Superman mythos and warps into something quite new. Is it better? That's the fundamental question. Many of the elements from the 1979 version are here: the planet Krypton, Jor-El, General Zod, Jonathan Kent, Lois Lane, Perry White and of course the Man of Steel. However, in this version, the many ingredients are switched around and the order of the recipe turns out quite different. It's still the recognizable Superman, or is it? Several elements are changed, including Lois meeting with Superman, and later the arrival of Zod on a mission so different than any previous offering whether it be comic book, film, or television.Probably the strongest aspect of the film is its imagery rather than the dialog or the acting. The story begins on Krypton like the older film. Alternatively, the imagery of Krypton and the inhabitants ring of 1930's and 1940's SF rather than the 1979 film or the comic books from the 1940's through 1960's. The ships and devices have their roots more in the original Alien film, with dark gray's and brown's instead of the bright crystals of the 1979 version. The story is updated to reflect 21st century United States rather than Superman of the 1940's or the 1970's. Lois Lane has a cell phone and even posts a story online. When General Zod and the baddies arrive, albeit before Superman is really known, the imagery and feel is much more like a current science fiction film than Superman battling domestic bad guys. This could frustrate some purists who wanted the story to reflect the Superman of tradition.Although the look of the film is tremendous, the acting and writing department is not equal to the first two offerings starring Christopher Reeve. While Russel Crowe is not a bad choice as Jor-El, the script and his subsequent performance are not as compelling as Marlon Brando's Jor-El several decades earlier. When Brando's Jor-El appeared in a black cloak with the &#34;S&#34; insignia, proclaiming an indictment against the traitors of Krypton, Zod and company, with the words &#34;This is no fantasy&#34;, we are pulled into a story about justice, right and wrong. The myth of Superman embodies the ideas of justice and morality. Although Superman itself is a fantasy, the issues of right and work, good vs evil, are every-present. Unfortunately, the present script didn't quite find a rhetorical theme from which to build a story. I had trouble really understanding what this film was about.The one character which was the most disappointing was General Zod. I realized what a tremendous performance Terence Stamp offered as Zod in the earlier films and yet here the present casting and his script were far less compelling. Somehow, the current Zod seems less intelligent and more prone to fits of rage. When Zod and his cohorts are on trial in the original film, you never sense that Zod is a victim but an individual who has acted out of malice by pure choice. In fact at the beginning of the 1978 version, we know that the failed coup, although we never saw it play out. We recognize because of the seriousness of the criminal proceedings, the overthrow came dangerously close to succeeding. The current Zod seems over his head, and not in fully in control. The coup is shown but somehow seems less believable, maybe even slightly contrived. Zod will essentially continue what he began on Krypton on Earth.What may save the film is the two leads played by Henry Cavill and Amy Adams. Cavill is a decent Superman and Adams holds her own as Lane. They definitely had more chemistry than the 2006 Superman Returns but not quite the magnetism as Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder.

That having been said, Superman needed an update to appeal to modern viewers, if you don't believe that look at how poorly Superman Returns did at the box office. Now don't misinterpret that whole modernization part,I still wholeheartedly believe that it is Supermans morals, nobility and character that make him super and not his powers. The modernizing I'm referring to is putting that character in a sleek, well thought out package that draws in the action oriented moviegoer so they can discover Supermans true greatness. I love how director Zack Snyder didn't go for a straight up linear timeline origin and instead used flashbacks to uncover his upbringing. It allowed us to move forward in Clarks story while looking back to defining moments in his life that have helped make him who he is. The influence of his Kryptonian and Earthly fathers is clear and the portrayals of both, by Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner respectively, are excellent and their presence is felt even when they aren't on screen. Michael Shannons General Zod is sympathy for the devil villainous in that you can understand his reasons if not his methods. Antje Traue is a suprising standout as Faora, Zods zealously loyal 1st Lietenant. The special effects are top notch and the scale of the battle scenes rivals Avengers.

1561339,AHMBRRDMGIFV3,B008JFUPFI,Conelius III,"[6, 14]","This movie was bad.I could end this review right here but why would I?This movie is a mess, it attempts to deliver an origin story for Superman but the problem is that we never connect to Clark as a character. The first chunk of the movie takes place on Krypton, a location that in all honesty doesn't matter because it explodes, the only reason Krypton is shown is because A) Avatar was popular, let's show an Avatar-esque world and B) Thor was popular and that took place in part in an alien world so let's show another world's culture. The problem was this is a Superman movie and at the 30 minute mark we still know nothing about Clark.In fact even by the big moment in the movie when Clark flies for the first time we have a problem in that we still don't know who Clark is as a person. We saw him as a child, and we see him get punched and then destroy a trucker's livlihood in retaliation, so we know two things: Clark wants to save some people and Clark is petty. The next problem is that his father sent him from Krypton so he'll have a choice, but as soon as he meets his father's ghost he says something to the effect of ""this is what you should do."" So Clark then has no choice.Ok got it.So at no point in the movie do we get to see Clark as a person, he's an emotionless beast who does nothing and even when he does show himself he's simply too cocky to have any personality other than that of a jerk. Who then is the main character? Is it Amy Adams? Well I mean she is the one we learn the most about but even she is barely deveolped as a character, instead she somehow is brought into any and every situation for no reason.So here's the next problem. Superman gets his power from earth's atmosphere right? The Kryptonians get their power from Earth's atmosphere. Why then can these characters jump far and run fast even when they have their suits on? It's the atmosphere but that only gives them xray vision and laser eyes... Why then do they want to terraform earth? Wouldn't they want to be superhuman? Leave earth alone and kill the people then live as GODS.Ok, logic problems aside let's look at the ""story"" any origin story should follow the basis of the heroes journey, this is just how it works. Superman has an awful heroes journey because we don't know who he is.

1561340,AUCISQA1YXX86,B008JFUPFI,Confederate,"[2, 5]","Unless I give a movie three stars or more, I wouldn't recommend owning it. The MAN OF STEEL is just more of the same. A man with the powers of a god is cast as a modern savior of the world, being in the world but not of the world. In some versions, Superman can be seen floating unconscious, as if on a cross. In this movie, he seeks out a priest when a window showing Christ praying in the Garden.MAN OF STEEL is convoluted and despite the fact that everyone knows the story, writers continue to insist on retelling it. Krypton, invariably a cold, distant planet, is doomed. There are no mountains or beautiful valleys or rivers, just a sterile world of varying shades of gray. Superman's father, Jor-el, sends his only son, Krypton's Only Begotten Son, to Earth, where its sun will give the child near limitless powers.This movie lacks warmth, humor or ingenuity (unlike Marvel's outstanding films). Faced with three super-powerful villains from his home world, Kal-el relies only on his power, leveling much of New York. Just rebuilt after the Avengers' famous battle, these new villains destroy much of the city in the ensuing battle with Kal-el. In scenes disturbingly reminiscent of 911, buildings topple and thousands are killed. Superman wins the day with his fists, but it would have been a better story if he'd used his brains to outwit his opponents, setting decisive and humorous traps. I also think it would have been better if the Man of Steel had lured them out West, where people would have been spared.In an ending which is incredible for its irony, Superman is scolded for destroying a satellite that, as a military officer informs the audience, ""cost us twelve and a half million dollars!"" Really? After billions of dollars and an incalculable loss of human life, this officer is concerned about a $12-million satellite. Doesn't anyone read the scripts? Even in THE AVENGERS, the loss of life and destruction was major news. And Iron Man comes away from it with emotional scars which nearly destroy his alter ego, Tony Stark. But Superman is only happy to have found his niche on Earth.The computer generated effects were astounding, but this isn't a movie you'll want to dig out and watch repeatedly. Why would one want to? Kent's odd jobs such as working on an oil rig to hide his abilities and identity remind me of Marvel's Wolverine, living as a lumberjack. In fact, the similarities are more than just a bit creepy.

At least I didn't text through the whole movie.This new Superman gets off to slow start, spending a fairly long time on Krypton.  It's an interesting Krypton though, with a sort of Dark City wardrobe.  A lot of gadgets that look like jellyfish with snow crab claws for legs.  Nice!  Jor-El uses a giant bird-like critter as a taxi, pretty much straight out of the Taarna sequence in Heavy Metal.  Suffice to say, this is not the type of Krypton where they have achieved peace and everyone walks around wearing a toga.Once Cal gets to earth, it's a different movie.  Instead of mapping things out the way they did on Krypton, on earth there are just a few flashbacks and (I guess) the assumption that maybe you've already heard Superman's story.  The rest is 90 minutes of special effect battle scenes.  While not much is new, they will be hard to top.  I particularly enjoyed the incredibly good looking Antje Traue.  The effects are academy award level and if they give an award for product placement, Nikon and iHop are a shoe-in.  There is also a religious vibe as Superman gets his strength from the sun and you can literally hear the angels singing.

1561349,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B008JFUPFI,C. Sawin,"[8, 16]","With Zack Snyder's last few directorial efforts being a bit better than lukewarm at best, ""Man of Steel"" felt like Snyder's way of going all in. It is incredibly difficult to get excited about ""Man of Steel"" if you aren't a fan of the character and if you didn't like the last live action Superman film ""Superman Returns"" (spoiler: not many did). The teaser for the film didn't help matters. Clark hitchhiking and enlisting as an extra on ""Deadliest Catch"" seemed to hint at an incredibly painful and unbearably long wait until Kal-El finally donned the blue tights, red cape, and S-shield to transform into one of the most iconic comic book heroes in the history of the medium. While there are several hiccups in ""Man of Steel,"" Zack Snyder has unleashed a super heroic powerhouse of a film and has made someone who has ragged on Superman for years change his tune.You see the last days of Krypton as Kal-El's parents Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) send him to Earth to not only escape certain death, but also have the opportunity to choose his own destiny. You witness the threat that General Zod (Michael Shannon) has become. Most of the film is devoted to Kal-El (Henry Cavill), given the name Clark Kent on Earth, coming to terms with himself, gaining control of his powers, and learning where he comes from. There are flashbacks to his childhood and his adopted parents Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane). Along the way, Clark crosses paths with Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) where an investigation of the century slowly evolves into an incredible bond. After 33 years of peace since his arrival, Zod finally finds the Kryptonian that slipped through his grasp. Clark is now left with a choice to either turn himself in or see the planet he's grown to call home completely decimated.As you witness the jaw dropping opening sequence of the destruction of Krypton, you can't help but imagine how massive the budget of this film must be ($225 million). The Kryptonian technology is even more alien than you're expecting and the massive destruction left in the aftermath of alien titans battling each other on a fragile planet is overwhelming. This is one visually dazzling film. The sound is also marvelous. The world engine makes your insides quake as every punch and every blow during each battle practically rocks your movie theater seat. Hans Zimmer's score is just as impressive as you've come to expect from the award winning composer and may be even better than the score for ""The Dark Knight Rises.""One of the things people disliked about ""Superman Returns"" was its lack of action. ""Man of Steel"" begins with Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon beating the holy hell out of one another and then is mostly quiet on the action front for a big chunk of the film. Then the last hour just hammers you down into the dirt and repeatedly rubs your face in it until the credits roll. Your goose bumps will have goose bumps. It's extraordinary.Henry Cavill is an extremely solid Superman, but you don't get to see much of him as the nerdy Clark Kent that works at the Daily Planet. That seems to be what really makes or breaks the actor in the role. Brandon Routh was criticized for attempting to mimic Christopher Reeve too much in ""Superman Returns."" So when the sequel comes around, it'll be interesting to see how Cavill handles dual identities. Michael Shannon is freaking outstanding as Zod. The man just has so much passion and anger. Shannon steals every scene he's in and continuously delivers impeccable performances in everything he's a part of.There's at least a good hour where you're shown nothing but Superman's past, the jobs he's taken on as an adult, and are stuck learning his origin from Krypton, so impatient individuals may get antsy in the middle of the film since there's a pretty long gap in between action sequences at first. The film clocks in at just under two and a half hours, but if it feels long just know that it pays off. The camera work may be the deal breaker for you, as well. It's pretty shaky at times and has a tendency to open with a wide shot and then zoom-in in nearly every major action-heavy sequence. However, you find yourself adjusting to it as the film advances.There are legitimate points in the film where it seems like there is no hope; not only for Superman but for all mankind. That's the way a superhero film should be; a hero defying the odds to save the world from what was thought to be an unbeatable enemy. ""Man of Steel"" is a chill-inducing visual spectacle that is absolutely Herculean in nature with a downright glorious performance by Michael Shannon, an epic score, and extremely intense

1561351,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B008JFUPFI,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[4, 13]","DC Comics has rivaled and preceded Marvel Comics for many decades with its roster of super heroes and is now attempting to reestablish their greatest character, Superman. Having been previously depicted in movies and television, Man of Steel is the biggest production to date.  Is it any good, and is it better than Superman Returns?  Yes and yes.  Despite a darker tone, (courtesy of the creative tandem of producer Christopher Nolan and writer David Goyer from The Dark Knight films and director Zach Snyder of Watchmen), this adventure is an entertaining action piece with a deep psychological subtext.The planet Krypton is dying, and scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Lara launch a spacecraft to send their newborn son, Kal-El, to a promising world, Earth.  General Zod (Michael Shannon), whose attempted coup is thwarted, is banished into a wormhole.  When Krypton is destroyed, Kal-El lands on earth, and through a series of flashback vignettes, we see the school boy named Clark struggling with growing pains and the values instilled by his adoptive human parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane)  who try to hide his superhuman strength and abilities.  As an adult, Clark (Henry Cavill) takes a series of jobs and remains anonymous, off the grid until odd reports begin to circulate of a mysterious man who saves lives with remarkable powers which brings reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) hot on his trail.  The setting shifts from the cornfields of Midwest America to Metropolis.  As General Zod reappears to claim earth for his race, the stage is set for a grand battle with the fate of the world in the hands of a true blue hero.There are some fine moments such as the young Clark befriending a former bully and being repaid in kind.  There is the tornado scene that brings Clark's non-use of his powers to a turning point.  Later, when the military first meet Superman and question his intentions, he responds by rescuing scores of people and is vindicated in a touching moment.This Superman (with more than a passing parallel with Jesus) is depicted as an emotionally vulnerable soul, and although he possesses great powers and invincibility, he does feel pain especially when meted out by his own kind.  The whole film is ultimately a moral struggle and contrast between two fathers and whether their son's powers are meant for good or to be kept hidden no matter what the cost.  It's also about his personal journey to find his purpose amid a normal life and search for his origins.  Can he embody the best of both worlds, and to what lengths will Superman go to save humanity?Cavill is quite convincing as Superman, certainly an improvement on Brandon Routh's turn in Superman Returns.  Adams shows a thoroughly capable yet vulnerable Lane, a strong reporter and Pulitzer Prize winner to boot!  Her scenes with Superman work quite well especially in the quieter, intimate moments which one hopes will lead to much more in future installments.The supporting cast excels.  Crowe lends gravitas to a subordinate role, and he registers every time he appears. Diane Lane is good as the compassionate Momma Kent.  (Ironically Lane starred in Hollywoodland about TV's Superman, George Reeves).  Costner makes a strong impression as the resolute, adoptive dad who is willing to risk his life for a principal.  Laurence Fishburne is a more three-dimensional Perry White, and Christopher Meloni is effective as a hardnosed military commander.Special visual effects have come a long way since 1978's Superman when the slogan was, ""You'll Believe a Man Can Fly!"" Some of the effects show incredibly fast motion which makes you wonder how cool it would be to realize such DC Comic characters as The Flash.  While Hans Zimmer has the appropriate, heroic musical score in place here, John Williams truly memorable theme song is a hard act to follow.The action is not the cartoon variety; people do get hurt and some perish.  Regarding that final battle in the streets of Metropolis (previously depicted in Superman II), enough already!  We've seen The Avengers decimate New York City and The Transformers wreak havoc on a massive scale.  These scenes are becoming old hat (even in a post 9/11 world), and are starting to seem repetitive overkill.  Don't get me started on the obvious product placement; when it begins to be noticeable, it becomes annoying.Perhaps the only disappointment here is the lack of much humor or lightheartedness. There are a couple funny moments; the film could have used a few more.  One hopes a lighter tone is in store for the next chapter. Maybe we will see Lex Luthor and Jimmy Olsen who are both missing here. You barely see Clark Kent get his gig at The Daily Planet before the credits roll.  Oh, and contrary to the Marvel films, do not bother staying through the credits in hope of a post credit tease.  The film's greatest accomplishment is setting a strong foundation for the next Superman adventure and possibly the beginnings of a Justice League of America (emulating Marvel's The Avengers).

The only thing this movie set out to do for me was take my money providing no real entertainment value. It's an overrated mess of a story for the first true comic book super hero.The ""S"" stands for shaky.Zach Snyder's cinematography for this movie is such a joke. I'm not talking about the sets, super use of CGI, or look of the film. I'm talking about his over use shaky hand cam he used to film this thing. Ever scene, and I'm being serious here, had a shaky documentary effect that proved to be more annoying and completely pointless when watching this film on the big screen. I thought the Hunger Games was annoying. Heck no, this blows that shaky cam issue out of the water! Also there are segments of ""scenery"" of object emphasis that I thought was tailored only for that teaser trailer that ran in front of the Dark Knight Rises. You get that here no matter what, ladies and gentleman. And to top it all off we have another over used camera effect for almost ever CGI scenes. A very Battlestar Galactica (redo series) zoom in tactic when anything flies or falls down in this movie. It becomes so predictable with Hans Zimmer score that you could literally turn it into a drinking game. The Dark Knight Trilogy, hell Pacific Rim's, action scenes are tame to Man of Steel's calmer sections. Why do we need to shaky cam a conversation between Pa Kent and young Clark and why do we need to zoom in on Lois's escape pod as it falls to the ground when we clearly see it the first angle? The fight scenes are what you call the meat and the bones of this feature. Some seem to just go on and on like I was watching a hyper violent Anime like Dragon Ball Z. Don't get me wrong here, Zach's intention of Kyrptonians fighting each other would be on the same destruction plane as this, but at least make them interesting and not a chore to get through.The ""S"" stands for Superfluous.Oh boy, then the plot! Which had either too much going on or ended up confusing it self with the littlest things. Because we know if Christopher Nolan is involved as producer and David S. Groyer is here to write the story, then we're going to have things overly explained. Segments like the atmosphere issue with Kryptonians, Kal-El being the first natural birth in awhile, the Phantom Drive and exploratory machines, and the codex felt like moments from the infamous plot shotgun (where writers throw ideas into one barrel then blast it at the wall and try to make sense out of it.) Story elements like these could have been explained easier or completely cut out. Remember Superman II, people? The explanation for why Zod and his lackeys are super powered were explained in 5 minuets. NOT ALMOST THE WHOLE MOVIE. So I'll get this out of the way then: If Groyer states that a Wonder Woman movie is impossible to write, but Marvel literally lets a talking raccoon use a machine gun, then I can honestly say that Groyer knows nothing about how to make Superman interesting. I mean they put Zod into this movie for the sake that he is the villain mostly everybody remembers from the old Superman movies. While we don't get any amazing lines like ""KNEEL BEFORE ZOD!"" We get a muddled CGI science fiction plot that was mixed with action scenes that overstayed their welcome. I'm going to say they should have made a live action version of the first three episodes from the Superman The animated series cartoons (seriously, go watch them!), because the technology reeked of a different villain. ""Nah! We'll just use Zod again. Everybody knows Zod. And I like redoing old movie stories. Nobody would would like Brainiac"" as told in my interpretation of David S. Groyer's mind.The ""S"" stands for Sub-par.There is no point in going into the full detail of the main actor's Superman because he's about as interesting as a painted brick. He's there to look shiny, but there is not real oomph to it. I have no idea where critics get the idea that the supporting cast was purely awesome.  Amy Adams became the weakest link in the whole bunch with Kevin Costner being bland as ever. No wait, Kal-El's mother was the bland 2 X 4 here. I'm assuming that Kyrptonioan physiology must be that different from humans, but come on! You just gave birth the kid with the imminent destruction of your home planet! I know I would be bawling my eyes out. I guess Russell Crowe's ""space ghost dad"" had some good moments. But because the bleakness of this film, it was hard for me to enjoy most of the acting performances presented. If there was any charm, wit, or humor, well, I certainly didn't notice that much. Like, why am suddenly supposed to care about Jimmy Olsen's replacement? Why am I more of perplexed instead of saddned of Pa Kent's random death? The only person here who knows to bring his ""A game"" to the table was Michael Shannon as Zod. If nothing else, watch it for him, and the commercial placement getting wrecked because they had more characteristics than the rest of the cast. Seiously, the movie should have been called ""Zod Breaks Steel.""The ""S"" stands for Sort of?So did I enjoy anything in this movie? Pretty much anytime the camera wasn't shaking or zooming in. Like the epic science fiction Kyrpton segments that showed scale of the Phantom Zone drive. There were scenery shots that reminded me of some of my favorite comic book moments. For example, when Superman finally reveals himself, that scene was something like reading Alex Ross's Kingdom Come. Hans Zimmer's score here is now one of my favorites of his. While there is no triumphant John Williams theme that can make adults and children hum at anytime, this score is full of emotions that makes you want fly or fight for humanity...you know while you destroy your beloved city in the process. When Superman and Zod finally fight just each other, I was actually entertained. I thought to myself, ""this right here is what I paid to see."" Hell, I wasn't even shocked by what Superman had to do at the end of the fight. I myself thought it was a justified action since this could be the lesson for Superman to learn. Then the ""I'm sorry sir, he's just SO hot"" dialogue part happens. BOOM! like an airplane crash, I immediately remembered everything of why I hated this film. Thank you so much Mr. Snyder and Groyer!The ""S"" stands for Scared.I am a huge DC comics nerd and I was hoping this movie was going to return some of that inner teen when I watched marathons of the Justice League from the still perfect DC Animated Universe. I was scared that with Snyder directing, because his 300 and Watchmen approaches were, although true to source material, his execution of it ended up as still meh. I understand that this is not the Superman I grew up with and the movie was striving to be something different. I'm open to revamps or reincarnations, but only when they are done right and it's enjoyable to watch as a whole. What we got was a movie that either pleases fans or non fans but also created a huge negative reception from fans and non fans. Usually you strive to please the most, not cause a huge rift between the two. I have no clue what Snyder's attempt was with direction this movie, but I have to assume that he thinks newer audiences always dig grittier things for heroes that usually aren't. Also we apparently have attention spans of fleas with these camera techniques used. The thing that hurts the most? This movie is now Warner Brothers and Legendary picture's template for the DC cinematic Universe, and that is a serious problem. See, the difference between this and Marvel's approach, was that Iron Man was enjoyable from the start and Robert Downey's acting enthusiasm that charms the audience right from the start! For DC, I'm scared of what the next set of movies are going to be like if this is what they base it off of.I have to point out one final issue: Why was it called ""Man of Steel?"" Was it because it's a Superman movie and the title pertains to one of his many comic identities? At least in The Dark Knight we received Jim Gordon's message for the climax of the film to help personify why Batman is called this, or you know, they say the freaking title and it meant something! In this movie, we get nothing! I'm assuming it's titled that because Kal-El crashed through tons of steel then. I don't know, you tell me!Well, for now, this ""S"" definitely stands for SUCKS.",2,"Zack Snyder's ""S"" stands for Sucker Punched.",1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,8440,"['Star', 'Trek', 'Into',

But he knows he's destined for something special, and grows into a wayfaring stranger who saves lives wherever he goes, leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for a dedicated young reporter.  She finds him...just as an outcast from his homeworld does, an egomaniacal patriot who plans to remake the Earth...by killing off all of humanity.He is...Superman...kinda.Purists will probably despise MAN OF STEEL, or at least have several bones to pick with it.  I, for one, have never really been into the SUPERMAN movies per say; I'm very picky about my superheroes, at least as far as film goes, and prefer darker, layered stories than what one usually gets with Superman.  Even with DARK KNIGHT director Christopher Nolan on board as producer, and David Goyer penning the script, MAN OF STEEL is still happy fluff; there's rarely anything at stake, we know how it's gonna turn out (mostly; there's a nice twist there at the end), and we know our hero will end up happily ever after. There are a few too many flashback scenes, almost all of them repetitive, and the strongest feature a very good Kevin Costner.  And the antagonism between Michael Sheen's General Zod and Henry Cavill's Kal-El just isn't quite there; this is largely the result of shoddy dialogue for Sheen, who has moments of brilliance interspersed between by-rote delivery (as though he's aware the character could've been better written).What helps MAN OF STEEL stand out, and makes it worthwhile, is the crew behind it.  The film is visually stunning; say what you want about director Zack Snyder, but he always brings a visual flair to his films.  (By the way: this doesn't feel like a Snyder film until the final confrontation, which is actually quite breathtaking.)  Nolan's big-budget fingerprints are all over this, though it is wholly distinct from any of his own films.  The story itself makes little sense, and is so full of holes, if you aren't careful, you'll fall right through.But story isn't the point; most of us know the story.  What MAN OF STEEL sets out to do is give a fresh take on the Superman mythos, while still adhering to its roots.  It does this (again, for the most part) fairly well, thanks to the crew behind the camera, and the film's principle star in front.  In Henry Cavill, we finally have a modern Superman we don't feel bad rooting for.  Cavill is charismatic enough to bring the character to life, but has enough depth to his performance to let us know there are things ticking beneath the surface.  It's not an Oscar-caliber performance, but it's good enough to help carry the film, and that's a step up from where we've been.  While MAN OF STEEL may not have been everything its makers hoped for, it's better than what some fans feared, and should at the very least inspire anticipation for the inevitable sequel.",4,"""You will help them accomplish wonders.""",1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,2945,"['been', 'living', '33', 'years', 'raised', 'caring', 'farming', 'couple', 'who', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'existence', 'out', 'destined', 'something', 'special', 'wayfaring', 'stranger', 'who', 'leaving', 'trail', 'breadcrumbs', 'dedicated', 'young', 'reporter', 'just', 'outcast', 'homeworld', 'egomaniacal', 'patriot', 'who', 'remake', 'Earth', 'killing', 'off', 'humanity.He', 'Superman', 'kinda.Purists', 'will', 'probably', 'despise', 'MAN', 'OF', 'STEEL', 'least', 'have', 'several', 'bones', 'pick', 'one', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'SUPERMAN', 'movies', 'say', ""'m"", 'very', 'picky', 'superheroes', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'film', 'prefer', 'darker', 'layered', 'stories', 'what', 'one', 'usually', 'Superman', 'Even', 'DARK', 'KNIGHT', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'board', 'producer', 'David', 'Goyer', 'penning', 'script', 'MAN', 'OF', 'STEEL', 'still', 'happy', 'fluff', 'rarely', 'anything', 'stake', 'know', 'how', 'gon', 'turn', 'out', 'mostly', 'nice', 'twist', 'end', 'know', 'hero', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'happily', 'ever', 'are', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'almost', 'repetitive', 'strongest', 'feature', 'very', 'good', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'antagonism', 'Michael', 'Sheen', 'General', 'Zod', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'Kal-El', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'there', 'largely', 'result', 'shoddy', 'dialogue', 'Sheen', 'who', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'interspersed', 'by-rote', 'delivery', 'aware', 'character', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'written', 'MAN', 'OF', 'STEEL', 'stand', 'out', 'worthwhile', 'crew', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'say', 'what', 'want', 'director', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'always', 'visual', 'flair', 'films', 'way', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Snyder', 'film', 'final', 'confrontation', 'actually', 'quite', 'breathtaking', 'Nolan', 'big-budget', 'fingerprints', 'are', 'wholly', 'distinct', 'own', 'films', 'story', 'little', 'sense', 'so', 'full', 'holes', 'are', ""n't"", 'careful', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'right', 'through.But', 'story', ""n't"", 'point', 'most', 'know', 'story', 'What', 'MAN', 'OF', 'STEEL', 'sets', 'out', 'do', 'give', 'fresh', 'take', 'Superman', 'mythos', 'still', 'adhering', 'roots', 'again', 'most', 'part', 'fairly', 'well', 'thanks', 'crew', 'camera', 'film', 'principle', 'star', 'front', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'finally', 'have', 'modern', 'Superman', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'bad', 'rooting', 'Cavill', 'charismatic', 'enough', 'bring', 'character', 'life', 'enough', 'depth', 'performance', 'let', 'know', 'are', 'things', 'ticking', 'surface', 'not', 'Oscar-caliber', 'performance', 'good', 'enough', 'help', 'carry', 'film', 'step', 'up', 'where', ""'ve"", 'been', 'MAN', 'OF', 'STEEL', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'everything', 'makers', 'hoped', 'better', 'what', 'fans', 'feared', 'should', 'very', 'least', 'inspire', 'anticipation', 'inevitable', 'sequel']",N/A

1561365,AQYQYHHBN5PXO,B008JFUPFI,Daniel Knight,"[4, 7]","Simply put: Man of Steel was freaking awesome. I have been waiting for this type of Superman movie for longer than I can remember.  The original Superman movie was a good flick for its time, and Christopher Reeves did a masterful job of making us believe Superman could hide his identity behind the faade of a bumbling Clark Kent. But I'm not ashamed to admit I am from a generation that loves spectacular action and special effects, and I have been craving a Superman movie that really taps into the modern day potential of movie magic, with an equally engaging storyline and characters. Man of Steel delivers in spades.I don't give this praise lightly. I had serious reservations and doubts about this movie going into the theater. The bitter taste of Superman Returns was still fresh in my memory. I know the critics have been espousing that the former movie was better than people gave it credit for, that it actually got better reviews, etc.  Maybe Superman Returns wasn't a bad movie, but it certainly wasn't a good movie either. At best it was a ""blah"" movie, and for a Superman movie that just won't cut it. Superman never even throws a punch in the movie. In fact he gets his ass kicked by a couple of thugs while under the influence of kryptonite. In fact the biggest ""super"" feat in the movie was lifting a big rock, incongruously while under the influence of the same kryptonite that allowed the thugs to beat him nearly to death. In contrast, Man of Steel has some serious throwdowns with other Kryptonians. Even the super lifting feat included in this movie, holding up a collapsing oil rig tower, is a heck of a lot cooler than slowly lifting a big rock into space.My reservations about Man of Steel continued in the early days of the production as news trickled out. Nolan and Goyer became involved, and though they did a spectacular job with the first two installments of their Batman series, I was skeptical about their suitability for the Superman franchise. How would their dedication to ultra-realism translate to a story about a man who can bench press mountains and fly through space? Furthermore, in my opinion the last installment of their take on the Batman mythos strayed way off course, compounding my doubts. We soon learned that Zod would be the major antagonist of the new movie, and while I was encouraged that Superman would have a real superhuman opponent, I feared we would get another poor copy of the original movies, just as Superman Returns came across as a poorly plagiarized version of the original. The earliest trailers for the new movie didn't help either. They seemed to suggest a long drawn out discovery process, devoid of the Superman action sequences I was craving. The most exciting thing they showed in the original trailer was Superman flying. We've been there, done that.Subsequent trailers offered more promise, though they still didn't show a lot. I guess they were using the old trick of the strip tease, show us just enough to get us interested. In hindsight I'm glad they didn't show or reveal more, because every moment of the movie was a treat, unspoiled by over divulging trailers prior to release. I often despair when I have to sit through another origin story for these comic books icons that I know so well. I'm anxious to get to the good stuff. But Man of Steel managed to make the new origins fresh and interesting, and extremely relevant to the overall story.And holy crap did they nail the casting of the new Superman. Henry Cavill's Superman makes previous movie renditions of the character look like guys playing Halloween dress-up. This guy looks like he could bend steel, even without the movie magic. The acting was solid all the way around. Superman came across as caring, complicated, and heroic. Lois Lane was likable, smart, and had a real adventurous spirit, and loads of integrity. You could easily see why Superman would fall for this mortal woman. Contrast that with super-bitchy Lois from Superman Returns. Is it any wonder he decided to leave the planet for five years?Some critics have argued that this Superman is too violent and not true to the character. These people obviously don't know much about the character. Most of Superman's stories (comic books, animated series, original Superman movies) involve violent conflicts with other superhuman opponents. Do they really think we want another movie where Superman battles the elements and catches falling airplanes.So to summarize, why is Man of Steel the best superman movie ever:1. Awesome action that makes great use of the environment (smashing buildings to pieces, mega explosions).2. Intense superhuman versus superhuman combat (can you say using a train as a weapon -  gives new meaning to more powerful than a locomotive).3. A villain with a goal that makes sense (unlike Lex Luthor from Superman Returns, who thought an ugly chunk of black crystal/rock would make for prime real estate).4. A Superman that looks the part (I am very much a straight man - but even I had to think DAMN when I saw Henry Cavill as Superman, and sans shirt in a particular scene).5. A Superman who embraces his role as humanity's protector (I loved Smallville, but Clark's crying about being different could be tiresome in the early seasons - come on you can run faster than the speed of sound and juggle tractors - yeah, sucks to be you. Not to mention being able to see into the girl's locker room).6. Lois Lane is no dummy (A pair of glasses were never going to fool this girl).7. No more camp (Man of Steel has it's humorous moments, without resorting to the type of campy antics that were pervasive throughout Superman Returns).In summary, Man of Steel is the Superman movie I have been waiting for since I first fell in love with the character. I can't wait to see where they take us next.",5,Man of Steel: Best Superman movie...ever!,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,5822,"['Simply', 'put', 'Man', 'Steel', 'was', 'freaking', 'awesome', 'have',

Cooter,"[17, 27]","First off, this is NOT one of the Donner/Reeves Superman movies, nor is it Superman Returns - that seems to be the beef with many people giving this movie bad reviews.  This movie stands on its own, as those earlier movies did, too.  But, to paraphrase someone else, if you are a true Superman fan, you'd like 'em all.The movie spends a lot of time delving into the experiences and events shaping Clark Kent's life prior to donning the Superman suit, but without dwelling too long on them (think flashbacks), including the fate of Krypton at the time of his birth.  This also explains his actions once he dons the suit.  At times the movie is fast paced, and as this is in effect an origin story, character development for some of the supporting cast is therefor sacrificed (fodder for sequels?).  Some have commented that the ""spark"" between Superman and Lois is missing, but given the amount of time they spend together in the movie, and under the circumstances they are together, romance would be far-fetched, but their budding relationship is established.  The movie has also been criticized for excessive violence - perhaps, but if a ship load of Kryptonians arrived with the same powers as Superman, and they were intent on destroying Earth to remake it as a new Krypton, wouldn't you expect violence to ensue?  Another criticism I feel is unwarranted is the lack of humor (again, shipload of really bad Kryptonians - where's the humor in that?) - the movie has some humor, but it is subtle - such as when he is learning to fly, or when he is handcuffed...and then there is the episode with the truck.  At no point did I find the movie slow or boring.  To be honest, there were a few things I found questionable - I had a hard time understanding what some things were on Krypton, and it wasn't explained how General Zod and his crew could speak English (especially since they were just alerted to the planet's existence).  I also thought the peoples' (of Earth) reaction to the arrival of aliens from outerspace to be too low-keyed (wouldn't you expect a lot of people to be freaking out?).The casing was great, and credit must be given to Henry Cavill - he LOOKS like Superman - he could have literally jumped off a page in the comic books.

Unfortunately for the Man of Steel, every story has a beginning, middle and end. Something the average person learns when they are in kindergarten or First Grade! All three parts of a story need to be done well or else it's no fun! A great beginning does not make-up for a mediocre middle or a disastrous ending!The Man of Steel starts with a fantastic back story. For the very first time we really get to observe Krypton in all it's technological glory! Only to see the story slowly degenerate into camp with cardboard characters from the military that you could find in any comic books story. And, then like a car with a stuck accelerator, the story rapidly turns into another brainless war porn and 9/11-type flick (Chicago gets trashed instead of New York.  When your story is so rotten you distract your audience by wrecking another major city! Wow! That was imaginative!)Man Of Steel is also the ultimate product placement film. In fact, you could randomly choose a half-dozen movies that have been shown on the big screen this past year - and I'll bet you the Man of Steel has more product placement then all of them COMBINED! It was so obnoxious it was distracting! In the 45 years of watching movies I can only think of a handful of times that product placement has been this aggressive!! It's also symptomatic of an incredibly weak story!The Man of Steel is so bad I was dying to walk out; but, I went to see the film with a friend so I felt obligated to stay. At least I had the sense to close my eyes and tune-out the last half hour of explosions, grunting and screaming in order to put my meditation skills to the test! I'm happy to report that even though I was totally sober I was able to completely tune-out the last 30 minutes of the Man of Steel and I could care less about what happened to any of the story's characters!See:Product Placement in Hollywood Films: A HistoryandSo Bad, It's Good: More Than 50 Great Films for Your Bad Movie NightP.S.

""Long"" and ""loud"" should not be the first descriptors used when discussing one of the finest comic characters ever to grace the silver screen, but one has few alternatives in this case. It's understandable that Zach Snyder would have no grasp of the character, because the mere concept of ""character"" is completely lost on this big budget video-game cut-scene director. Chris Nolan should know better, however, even if he lost his grasp on the Batman character more and more with each successive Dark Knight film.It was obvious things were going to be rough when during the early promotional appearances Snyder and company said they used the ""Death of Superman"" storyline as the inspiration for much of the film. Choosing to use the most universally reviled storyline in the Superman canon? Sure, why not? What could go wrong?Everything. Throughout the film Superman is a cipher, and the last hour plus of mayhem is antithetical to the character's entire purpose.Not to mention that this movie has some of the most dumbfoundingly stupid dialogue of all time. Examples (paraphrased because who gives a flying patoot):1) Zod: ""There's only one way this ends: Either I die, or you die."" Actually, Zod old sport, that's *TWO* ways.2) Random Generic Female Villain: ""We have an evolutionary advantage, because we have no morality. And as history has shown, evolution always wins."" Always wins WHAT? EVOLUTION?????3) Lois: ""They say it's all downhill after the first kiss."" Superman: ""I think that only applies if you're kissing a human."" So.... Clark is saying that he's going to get bored with Lois because she's human. Well, forget you too, buddy.This movie is start to finish a disaster.

After about 20 minutes, I just quit watching ""Sharknado"".  In  ""Man of Steel"", a Krypton lady  (on loan from the ""Matrix"" trilogy, from the looks of her) tosses a military jet into a feed store in a Kansas town, and it was at that point that I just sighed and got up to make a sandwich.

1561376,A1UIMU8Q87ZPCH,B008JFUPFI,"Darren Levine ""He shoots, He Edits, He freque...","[4, 14]","My initial impression after the viewing? Wow, they tried so hard, and accomplished so little...************This is a really LONG review, so i'll give you a summary to start, if you just want the rundown, read the next paragraph, if you want more detail and insight, the rest of it awaits you after that:MOS is a big, long, drawn out movie. It DOES entertain, and i'm glad that i saw it, but it left me with more disappointment than satisfaction. It is plenty better than that last superman garbage, but that's not saying much is it? The action, it's great, these filmmakers know proper action, but the story takes too long to flesh out, and instead of getting an exciting buildup, it just kind of tugs along. Do i recommend seeing it? Sure, it should provide you with some entertainment, just don't go into with with big expectations, it's just a flick, not a slice of cinematic brilliance.************What i mean is that the film is cramming so much in there, with story, effects, drama, emotion, explosions, screaming, and so many kitchen sinks, that it just kind of blows past you. Let me break it down.Too much backstory. Batman Begins kind of jump started the whole backstory crazy. But with batman, the backstory had focus, it was engaging, and it didn't get in the way of the main story once that kicked into gear, it just revisited here and there intelligently to add to the main story. With MOS, the backstory is a beast that starts the movie off with a huge bite and it keeps on chewing throughout the whole movie. It takes so long for it to get to the point, i ran out of expectation for the climax, the build up was just fizzling for over a half an hour.The backstory basically nulled the main story, some might say that the movie is all about the backstory, but unless you're talking about Memento, i say that it just doesn't work well like that. The irony, is that I'm referencing well done movies which were written by the same people, the Nolan & Goyer! It's not to say that MOS is a bad movie, it just wasn't as good as it made itself out to be. Blame marketing for that, but i also blame the whole feel of the movie for that. These filmmakers are exceptional at making scenes that feel big and impressive.The problem is that those big impressive scenes just didn't have a whole lot of meaning/depth. The opening scene for instance, feels like it has a lot of meaning, but we're supposed to connect with a character who we just met, fighting someone we just met, on a planet we have no idea about? This is why i really shy away from films which kick things off with an action sequence, it rarely gets me engaged like it's supposed to. The one exception are sequels, such as empire strikes back, we're already connected with the characters, we know what's going on, that and our expectation and excitement are built up from the previous film. So in that case, a large battle to kick off the film works. In this case, i don't care that most of us already know the story, I'm not connected to any of these characters or what's going on. I would guess that the filmmakers thought that they should expand on what the original film showed us with the kryptonians, again, because we looooove backstory so much, we just can't get enough of it right? I think the original film got it much more right, it gave us what we needed to know about the kryptonians, and got us over to what the movie is about.I did like that the bad guy, general zod, had lots of things going on. His character had an interesting depth behind a stone wall face. In the same way professor X and magneto are friends but also enemies, zod and jor-el share a core desire, but with different drives and moral boundaries.Spoilers from here on. When the film finally starts getting to the point, it really takes its time leaning into it. It drags... and drags... and doesn't throw in any geek factor either to make us giggle, like when the hulk transforms-smashes giant flying alien thing, or when batman flip corrects his cycle off a wall... Yes I'm keeping references in the superhero realm, because that's whats relevant to MOS.The ending is what seemed to annoy a lot of people. Superman never kills, blah blah. I didn't mind, he actually had some conflict there, but it didn't have any build up or connection to anything, so i didn't feel much when he made the choice to snap zod's neck. Zod basically irks superman to do it, under the pretense that he has no more people, so he's going to kill superman's new people. It would have had more meaning for zod's character if he just wanted superman to kill him, and threatened to kill humans until he did, or until zod killed him. Then we'd get that nice ""i will not fight you"" kind of dynamic (hint: ROTJ)And then there was the issue i heard people had with superman not helping out the poor humans. Superman's character typically always takes time out of fighting the bad guy to save a few humans. And yes, he did neglect them a bit, but seriously, he had a lot on his plate. Poor guy never even had anything to eat the whole film. He did save some people, heck that's how he gained their trust.And then there's the big plot device, the terraforming thing to make the earth kill all humans and be habitable by kryptians. As a plot device, not bad, the details, not so good. first of all, since most people have seen the original films, we get the idea that superman gets his power from the sun. This movie says that too, but it adds that it's also from the atmosphere.... umm... ok... I'm listening... Yea so this terraforming thing changes the atmosphere to kryptonian and that's poisonis to humans, and human atmosphere is kinda crappy for kryptonians, it makes them cough and dizzy and stuff. But wait... superman can fly through space... no atmosphere... no breathing... so he can go to space and get away with not breathing... so why can't he do that when he's flying around the terraforming thing that's starting to make kryponian atmosphere and starts to make him cough and have a tummy ache?... oh well i guess they reasoned it's kinds blocking the sun a bit so superdude isn't getting his full does of no-need-to-breath ability. Not a huge deal, just an odd inconsistency that irked me.Ya know what else irked me? No lex luthor! Now there's a fun character to add some levity to the situation! That's what this film could have used, not necessarily lex, but something to drag it out of it's relentless seriousness the whole time. At least they had a truck with lexcorp on it, i liked that.They also made more than a subtle deal about the krptionian incubation/genesis ship being buried in 20,000 year old ice. why? who cares how long it's been there? and oh how coincidental it is that they just now discovered it as clark is coming into his own, and even more convenient that clark overhears some army guys talking about the weird thing they found, leading him to check it out and inadvertently send out a beacon to zod. a few too many conveniences.I did want to like this film, i was looking forward to it, and i think if the filmmakers didn't try so much to add/intensify to the originally story, and kept it simpler, it probably would have helped tremendously. It could probably even be trimmed down and made a bit better as it is, as is usual with long films that drag on.",3,"Really in depth review as to why this movie fell short, quite short",1382659200,"10

1561377,A3O0N562BLZ4Y8,B008JFUPFI,Dave,"[1, 6]","I had my hopes up very high for this movie. I was very disappointed because I was loving the trailers. Henry Cavill (the guy that played superman) was very good for the part. It's just a shame that the movie sucked. I thought the story could have been way better. The problem with all these new superhero movies coming out is that they can't get a good story line together. I feel like every movie it always has to be the end of the world. I don't even go to see any of these superhero movies in theaters anymore because it's always the same problem. Someone is always trying to destroy the world. These ppl making millions off these movies suck and it makes me sick that Hollywood can't come up with better stuff. However I will say there was some good that came from this movie. The superman ''S'', wow! I loved what they did with that. A symbol of hope. They changed the whole meaning of the ""S"" and I loved it. I always hated that it stood for Superman. I like that on his planet that it does not stand for a ""S"". It is a symbol of hope. And of course on Earth Louis made it into Superman. Very good thinking, loved it!I feel as if they should almost have 2 movies, a krypton movie and then a movie with superman on earth. I feel like superman is very complex and should be. After all he is from another planet. There was many parts in the movie to where I was just ready to turn it off, including the beginning with some stupid damn skull crap that they produce babies with lol. What bull crap - Its not the damn matrixs, its superman. Also almost the whole city got destroyed and at the end of the movie everything was fine lol. Yeah they must have forgotten that. I can't stand some of these stupid ignorant high paid story writers and producers. They are messing up movies that could be amazing. Movies now days lack a good well put together story line and lack making it believable. I know some movies you can't make things realistic all the time, but at least make it believable. I felt like damn idiots made this movie and it's a shame because Henry Cavil was a great guy to play the role of superman. I loved Henry Cavill's part/acting in Immortals and saw his great potential for being a great superman in that movie. Too bad it got effed up. Anway I had a idea about supermans suit because I felt like in the movie his suit came out of no where and there was no explaining of why having the suit was important. I think on his planet just as how we wear business suits, on krypton the superman suit should be what they wear on his planet for important situations. Colors and symbols should mean different things. Also on another note they need to come up with a better idea of clark kent because glasses to disguise himself does not work at all lol. I also find it hard to believe that a planet millions of light years away speak the same language as ppl on earth do. And I hated Zod in this movie and his reasoning for destroying earth. It was very stupid that zod wanted to make earth like kryton and lose his powers. If anything he should have been amazed by the powers he had on earth and wanted to just rule the planet. But no instead he wanted to lose his damn powers and kill everyone off lol. This movie just really sucked and i'm mad I bought it. I hope someone out there will make a great superman movie one day soon.",1,Still waiting to see a really good Superman movie.,1388707200,"01 3, 2014",2014,3340,"['had', 'hopes', 'up', 'very', 'high', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'was', 'loving', 'trailers', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'guy', 'played', 'superman', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'part', 'just', 'shame', 'movie', 'sucked', 'thought', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'better', 'problem', 'new', 'superhero', 'movies', 'coming', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'together', 'feel', 'movie', 'always', 'be', 'end', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'see', 'superhero', 'movies', 'theaters', 'anymore', 'always', 'same', 'problem', 'Someone', 'always', 'trying', 'destroy', 'world', 'making', 'millions', 'movies', 'suck', 'sick', 'Hollywood', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'better', 'stuff', 'However', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'good', 'came', 'movie', 'superman', 'S', 'wow', 'loved', 'what', 'did', 'symbol', 'hope', 'changed', 'whole', 'meaning', 'S', 'loved', 'always', 'hated', 'stood', 'Superman', 'like', 'planet', 'not', 'stand', 'S', 'symbol', 'hope', 'course', 'Earth', 'Louis', 'made', 'Superman', 'Very', 'good', 'thinking', 'loved', 'feel', 'should', 'almost', 'have', '2', 'movies', 'krypton', 'movie', 'then', 'movie', 'superman', 'earth', 'feel', 'superman', 'very', 'complex', 'should', 'be', 'planet', 'was', 'many', 'parts', 'movie', 'where', 'was', 'just', 'ready', 'turn', 'off', 'including', 'beginning', 'stupid', 'damn', 'skull', 'crap', 'produce', 'babies', 'lol', 'What', 'bull', 'crap', 'not', 'damn', 'matrixs', 'superman', 'Also', 'almost', 'whole', 'city', 'got', 'destroyed', 'end', 'movie', 'everything', 'was', 'fine', 'lol', 'Yeah', 'must', 'have', 'forgotten', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'stupid', 'ignorant', 'high', 'paid', 'story', 'writers', 'producers', 'are', 'messing', 'up', 'movies', 'could', 'be', 'amazing', 'Movies', 'now', 'days', 'lack', 'good', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'story', 'line', 'lack', 'making', 'believable', 'know', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'things', 'realistic', 'time', 'least', 'make', 'believable', 'felt', 'damn', 'idiots', 'made', 'movie', 'shame', 'Henry', 'Cavil', 'was', 'great', 'guy', 'play', 'role', 'superman', 'loved', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'part/acting', 'Immortals', 'saw', 'great', 'potential', 'being', 'great', 'superman', 'movie', 'Too', 'bad', 'got', 'effed', 'up', 'Anway', 'had', 'idea', 'supermans', 'suit', 'felt', 'movie', 'suit', 'came', 'where', 'was', 'explaining', 'why', 'having', 'suit', 'was', 'important', 'think', 'planet', 'just', 'how', 'wear', 'business', 'suits', 'superman', 'suit', 'should', 'be', 'what', 'wear', 'planet', 'important', 'situations', 'Colors', 'symbols', 'should', 'mean', 'different', 'things', 'Also', 'note', 'need', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'idea', 'clark', 'kent', 'glasses', 'disguise', 'not', 'work', 'lol', 'also', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'planet', 'millions', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'speak', 'same', 'language', 'ppl', 'earth', 'do', 'hated', 'Zod', 'movie', 'reasoning', 'destroying', 'earth', 'was', 'very', 'stupid', 'zod', 'wanted', 'make', 'earth', 'kryton', 'lose', 'powers', 'anything', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'amazed', 'powers', 'had', 'earth', 'wanted', 'just', 'rule', 'planet', 'instead', 'wanted', 'lose', 'damn', 'powers', 'kill', 'everyone', 'lol', 'movie', 'just', 'really', 'sucked', 'i', ""'m"", 'mad', 'bought', 'hope', 'someone', 'there', 'will', 'make', 'great', 'superman', 'movie', 'one', 'day', 'soon']",N/A

I loved the actor who played superman he was really good he got the character down very well. we all know that we can not replace Christopher reeves as superman but he comes pretty close. I thought he was better than Brandon Roth. this movie had so many intense fight scenes espicialy the ones between general zod and superman. I was glad they put a different villain besides lex luthor in the movie. I thought Michael Shannon did a great job as general zod. and I loved what they did with krypton they made it an actual planet with plants and animals it was very imaginative. this series is going to be great. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do.

Self-doubting and lonely, young Clark Kent wanders aimlessly until a band of militarists, led by General Zod (Michael Shannon), arrive to subjugate Earth and use Clark in their plan to revive their dead civilization.  Superman (Henry Cavill) is born.This film was too long and the plot was too busy to rate a top score, but I quite enjoyed it.  Director Zack Snyder, with David Goyer and Christopher Nolan, really make an effort to get under Superman's skin here and make him more than just an overstuffed Boy Scout.  I think they are successful, but the rest of the cast, with the possible exception of his two fathers, is given little to do as a result.  Unlike many, I kind of liked the flashbacks to Clark's boyhood; we were already on familiar ground with yet another retelling of Superman's origin, and I didn't much feel like sitting through thirty minutes of his Nebraska upbringing.  However, you really can't leave Pa and Ma Kent out of it, so it seemed like a reasonable choice.  Cavill is a great Superman but it looks like we have to wait for the next movie to we see whether he is a great Clark Kent as well.

Of course, with Superman there are numerous parallels to the spiritual life; a father sending his son to save the world, to be the bridge between their world and ours. Sounds familiar indeed. And in fact, the director (Snyder) intentionally played up these parallels between Superman and Jesus Christ, even explicitly stating such in the ""Special Features"" of the DVD. This approach, I think, produced a well crafted movie.It is always beautiful to see great strength joined to great humility in one person.

1561393,A1HDDJMKB2G5KC,B008JFUPFI,D. Barker,"[1, 4]","First, I think this is the best Superman movie out there, and I've watched all of them.  I'm not a purist.  I didn't read comic books when I was a kid, and I don't have the silly notion that a remake of a movie needs to be true to ANYTHING.  Because of that I get to judge each movie on its own merit.The one thing I never liked about other superman movies, and ESPECIALLY the old superman tv show series is the feel good aspect to it.  Now I know that the comics made Superman out to be some morally perfect being, but I never really liked that because it seemed too strange to me.  There has to be good and bad in everything for me to find something enjoyable and realistic since I've never seen anything different, because that's the way life is.  So I like the fact that this movie takes you through his journey as a boy and teenage years while he's struggling with life's challenges, the ones that every thing that speaks a language on this planet and looks like a human.  Some of the people most critical of the movie are critical for this reason, because it's too different.  OK, that's exactly why I like it so much since the other superman movies never really stirred my interest much.The other big criticism was that it doesn't flow evenly, difficult to follow, disjointed and various other criticisms where it seems like the reviewer is studying to be a film critic and needs to pic the thing apart.  I followed the movie just fine, I didn't have a problem with it focusing on the present moment more than anything else, which means there was a lot of constant action for a while (Superman is an action movie, right?)  After all the style was flashbacks to the past, so at some point the movie has to stop flashbacks and focus on the current moment, otherwise you have a drama or some other type of movie other than an action movie.  My wife is the gauge for me on a successful movie.  She falls asleep pretty easily, and she didn't watching this movie even though it's a little long.So as far as the content of the movie, I enjoyed this movie WAY more than any other superman movie.  Also, this is probably close to a record with how fast Amazon has over 2000 reviews on a movie, an overwhelming amount of which is 5 star.The thing I don't like is that the production wasn't very well done as far as image quality, and overall the movie looks a little bit grainy, which is my opinion is totally unacceptable in 2013 for such a big budget movie made by a big budget production company.  Other reviewers like to use the term CGI. I don't care if it's CGI or a real image of a cow.  In 2013 the capability to make a movie with fantastic picture quality is no longer new, and even the picture quality of the people, who are not CGI, looks grainy.If Warner Bros. does this again I won't buy anymore of their movies.  I dislike the quality that much.  It's not like War of the Worlds (2000s version with Tom Cruise which I can't even watch because the picture is so bad) bad, but even when I watched it in the theatre it seemed grainy.  I guess that should have been my clue to NOT buy it.",3,"Awesome movie, not awesome picture quality",1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2014,3095,"['First', 'think', 'best', 'Superman', 'movie', 'there', ""'ve"", 'watched', ""'m"", 'not', 'purist', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'comic', 'books', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'silly', 'notion', 'remake', 'movie', 'be', 'true', 'ANYTHING', 'get', 'judge', 'movie', 'own', 'merit.The', 'one', 'thing', 'never', 'liked', 'other', 'superman', 'movies', 'ESPECIALLY', 'old', 'superman', 'tv', 'show', 'series', 'feel', 'good', 'aspect', 'Now', 'know', 'comics', 'made', 'Superman', 'be', 'morally', 'perfect', 'being', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'seemed', 'too', 'strange', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'everything', 'find', 'something', 'enjoyable', 'realistic', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'different', 'way', 'life', 'So', 'like', 'fact', 'movie', 'journey', 'boy', 'teenage', 'years', 'struggling', 'life', 'challenges', 'ones', 'thing', 'language', 'planet', 'human', 'people', 'most', 'critical', 'movie', 'are', 'critical', 'reason', 'too', 'different', 'OK', 'exactly', 'why', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'superman', 'movies', 'never', 'really', 'stirred', 'interest', 'much.The', 'other', 'big', 'criticism', 'was', ""n't"", 'flow', 'evenly', 'difficult', 'follow', 'disjointed', 'various', 'other', 'criticisms', 'where', 'reviewer', 'studying', 'be', 'film', 'critic', 'pic', 'thing', 'apart', 'followed', 'movie', 'just', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'focusing', 'present', 'moment', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'was', 'lot', 'constant', 'action', 'while', 'Superman', 'action', 'movie', 'right', 'style', 'was', 'flashbacks', 'past', 'so', 'point', 'movie', 'stop', 'flashbacks', 'focus', 'current', 'moment', 'otherwise', 'have', 'drama', 'other', 'type', 'movie', 'other', 'action', 'movie', 'wife', 'gauge', 'successful', 'movie', 'asleep', 'pretty', 'easily', 'did', ""n't"", 'watching', 'movie', 'even', 'little', 'long.So', 'as', 'far', 'content', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'WAY', 'more', 'other', 'superman', 'movie', 'Also', 'probably', 'close', 'record', 'how', 'fast', 'Amazon', '2000', 'reviews', 'movie', 'overwhelming', 'amount', '5', 'star.The', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'production', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'done', 'as', 'far', 'image', 'quality', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'grainy', 'opinion', 'totally', 'unacceptable', '2013', 'big', 'budget', 'movie', 'made', 'big', 'budget', 'production', 'company', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'use', 'term', 'CGI', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'CGI', 'real', 'image', 'cow', '2013', 'capability', 'make', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'picture', 'quality', 'no', 'longer', 'new', 'even', 'picture', 'quality', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'CGI', 'grainy.If', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'anymore', 'movies', 'dislike', 'quality', 'much', 'not', 'like', 'War', 'Worlds', '2000s', 'version', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'watch', 'picture', 'so', 'bad', 'bad', 'even', 'when', 'watched', 'theatre', 'seemed', 'grainy', 'guess', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'clue', 'NOT', 'buy']",N/A

1561433,AQKLGDNJJAFPK,B008JFUPFI,dj,"[6, 10]","Normally, I'm not one who likes super hero movies. To me, they fizzled out with the repeated Batman movies of the 1990s, which got cheesier and cheesier with each launch. Chris Nolan's revival of Batman 10 years ago broke through a lot of barriers of the previous decade. What I disliked about the 1990s super heroes with all their irreverent gadgetry, silly attempts at comic relief, sloppy storytelling, and corny villains, etc. etc. - all this took a back seat to story-telling when Nolan gave us ""Batman Begins."" We got deep inside the psyche of Bruce Wayne and could follow and understand his struggles as he became the Batman. Once the Batman was established, we followed him along through another film where he wrestled with numerous moral dilemmas, and even picked up some socio-political commentary along the way, particularly when Lucius Fox refused to engage in Patriot Act style domestic espionage. While I felt Dark Knight Rises missed the mark, simultaneously I felt that Nolan's first two Batman films stood out as a resurgence of the super hero genre in the form of gripping stories where hero and villain had clear motives, good plot lines, captivating dialogue, plot twists, great backstories, exciting climaxes, and all of these things enhanced by great stage-fighting choreography, minimalistic use of CGI, and a very believable backdrop for Gotham City, primarily the city of Chicago. He showed us that he can powerfully tell the ""genesis"" story behind a super hero.So I anxiously awaited the release of ""Man of Steel,"" excited to see what Nolan was going to do with Superman, who became a national treasure in the 20th century with countless comic book storylines to choose from (so diverse are the storylines to choose from, that at one point in the comic series during the early 1990s, Superman was even killed). I think Nolan had many different avenues to explore with Superman. We had the endearing love story as portrayed by Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder in the 1970s and 1980s, which also simultaneously carefully balanced the psychological dichotomy of Clark Kent's struggle both to assist humanity and at the same time try to explore it. For ""Batman Begins,"" Nolan knew what he wanted from the start, and drew upon Bladerunner, Batman as comic book hero, modern day warfare and struggle, and even drew upon (ironically) the Superman movies from the 70s/80s. What most excited me was how Nolan was going to help me relate to Clark first, and then relate to Superman, just like he did with Bruce Wayne/Batman. I suspected we would get down to the basics like he did with Batman. I expected a great story. Instead what I got was a headache in the form of a 2 hour, 20 minute toy commercial.Right from the start, I had a lot of questions. I'm vexed how the Kryptonian race was unable to reproduce naturally, aside from Jor-El and his wife. I'm confused how the Kryptonians managed to destroy their own planet by siphoning off energy from its core. Why would Jor-el choose to lampoon his son to Earth and simultaneously send Zod and his companions along the same trajectory in space if he knew Zod was out to get his only son (and any hope of restoring Krypton)? The explanation is confusing regarding why Kal-El's parents didn't exile from Krypton with him when in just moments prior to jettisoning his son into space he managed to exile Zod and many of his companions into space safely. Also, how is it the ice surrounding Zod's ship is over 18,000 years old but Clark has only been on earth maybe 25 years? Does that mean Zod was here first? What took Zod and his companions so long to wake up? And why leave earth to orbit the moon to make a grand entrance when you're already on Earth? How come one of Zod's companions decomposed during exile, but Zod didn't? How did Lois piece all of the stories together to find the Kent household? Aside from a few fleeting scenes depicting Clark's superhuman strength, what was childhood like? Adolescence? When Clark's earthly father died in the original Superman movie, we felt Clark's pain, his inability to use his power to save life, and we wept along with him. The real genius behind John Kent's death in the original 1978 Superman movie was that even if Clark WANTED to save his earth-father's life, he COULDN'T. It was a heart attack that killed John. In Nolan's version, Clark COULD HAVE saved his earth-father, but John stayed Clark's willingness, which I think weakens the story, because it showed that Clark's power is virtually limitless. In the original version, there was NOTHING Clark could do to save his earth-father. Even the ""almighty"" Superman had limits. But Nolan's version fell flat, because ultimately it showed us that Clark could have stopped this tragedy from happening but didn't. All we got from Nolan's Superman was a scream of rage, and all for what - to save the family dog from a tornado? So Superman's Mothership (a veritable flying version of the Fortress of Solitude, naturally) has a key which magnetically flies out of your fingertips just before insertion, but the ship can't straighten its own nose cone properly so that all its electrical circuits line up so it can fly? And what would prompt some Air Force shlub to twist the nose cone in the first place? Once Superman turned himself over to Zod, then what? How would Zod extract all the DNA from Superman's body, and what would he do with those genetic codes? If he could clone all that DNA, wouldn't Kal-el be interested in seeing his parents, clones or not? And if he cloned Jor-el, could he merge Jor-el's cloned body with Jor-el's consciousness which is floating around somewhere inside the Flying Fortress of Solitude?I have a myriad of additional questions like this. And even if some of them are answered in the film, they're not answered adequately or in a plausible way. The problem for me is that Nolan and the other writers raise more questions than they can answer. And that's the trick with filmmaking. I think what peeves me most is that we've seen Nolan succeed at reincarnating a super hero before. Lastly, when it comes to telling the story of a super hero, there has to be common ground established with the audience. We have to relate to Kal-el, or the story isn't going to work.My final gripe I do not see among other reviewers too often, but to me, it was the WORST idea to interject into a Superman movie: Superman killing Zod. Do these filmmakers not know what Superman is all about? SUPERMAN. DOES. NOT. KILL. It's not in his nature. It never has been. And in this film, his killing of Zod flew in the face of everything Superman (supposedly) stood for up to that point. The movie completely ""broke"" at that point, violating the character of Superman- and for what purpose? I understand they wanted to reboot the Superman franchise, but if this is how Superman is depicted - NOT practicing what he preaches - then I'll go back to the Superman of the 1970s. At least the previous Superman had ethics and a moral code. Nolan's Superman has no control over himself.Lastly, the special effects. After 20 years in practice, I think CGI has finally arrived. This is the first film I've seen where the green/blue screening wasn't immediately apparent (Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" also finally got it right). I had a tough time distinguishing real images vs. CG images, which in the past gave themselves away with overly smooth motion, poor shadowing, or fuzzy details. I was impressed with the care given to Superman's flight. Daniel Tosh would be excited to know that we actually do see Superman speeding up in mid-air by giving it more ""umph."" We also see contrails from Superman's feet and hands. We see the cone of water vapor that forms around Superman's body while he is transonic. We hear a small sonic boom ""pop"" through the air as he breaks the sound barrier. We see him punch things and they break in realistic ways. We see x-ray vision in all its splendor - bone, tissue, organs, and beating hearts. The only problem with all of this is the level of noise that comes along with it. This is the noisiest film since Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" series. Everything is unbelievably loud. The noise is so ubiquitous I felt fatigued by the end of the movie. The noise is not warranted or even necessary. In my mind, special effects are not supposed to carry the story, and in ""Man of Steel,"" it felt like the producers attempted this. In fact, the final 20 minutes or so is one long fight scene. Yes, we have longed for the day when we could see Superman in a fight like this, and it is cool to watch, but when conjoined with poor storytelling, it felt gratuitous. We could have had the exact same fight sequences on the tail end of a great story and it would have felt justified. If these filmmakers would put a great story first, it actually makes fight scenes and special effects that much more ""special."" Case in point: remember in Star Wars how we felt when we saw spaceships dogfighting like WW2 aces for 15 minutes, climaxing in the explosion of the Death Star way back in 1977? The effects enhanced the story we were told for the two hours before it. Had the story buildup failed, the ending and all its technical accomplishments would have failed with it. I could say the same thing about ""Jaws"" as well, or a myriad of other well-written stories that required cutting edge special effects to tell. So yes, while ""Man of Steel"" is a technological accomplishment, the poor storytelling made it feel cheap.So an in all, I think the film is a failure from the standpoint of drawing the audience into the psyche of Superman, telling his story in a modern age (akin to ""Batman Begins"" and even the recent James Bond reboots). I think it also made the mistake of raising more questions than it answers. For this the movie garners one star from me. I'm awarding an additional star for the special effects, but in my mind, special effects should be the icing on the cake, not the cake itself.",2,Polarized reviews come from bad storytelling + great

1561434,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B008JFUPFI,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[11, 19]","""Man Of Steel""(Warner-DC, 2013)I went to see this one in the theater, with full-bore, big, loud 3D-IMAX, and it was pretty impressive.  I'd read a couple of harsh reviews slamming the film as a pile of slag, and I've never been that into the previous Superman movies, but I was ready to give it a chance: the trailer I saw months ago looked cool.So, yeah, it's pretty good.  The script is definitely on the serious side, tilting towards tragedy, and it grinds a little bit as they make absolutely sure we understand how tough Clark Kent's life has been. There are precious few light moments in the drama, certainly none of the slapstick seen in Joss Whedon's (excellent) ""Avengers"" and some of the plot points seemed excessively harsh -- the fate of Pa Kent, for example -- but all the grim realism effectively set the tone for the massive battle sequences, and that's where the heart of this film lies.This is a stunningly violent, amazingly kinetic film. I had thought Whedon nailed super-FX in ""The Avengers,"" but ""Man Of Steel"" takes superhero movies to a plateau several levels above anything we've seen so far. The on-screen destruction is massive, from the near-nuking of Smallville to the mega-9/11-ing of Metropolis, the digitally-produced havoc is truly epic -- at some point I realized I'd been immersed in nonstop chaos for about twenty minutes and I was still riveted and awed by what was onscreen. Very few moments looked awkward or dorky, the stiffness of motion that we've come to accept in high-tech action films was almost entirely smoothed away, and the impression of being there in the moment, keeping up with the speed and power of these thunderous metahumans was very convincing. The closest thing we've seen elsewhere was the forest battle scene between Iron Man and Thor, but this was that scene, cubed.In terms of translating the imaginative scope of comics-in-print into film, this was amazingly successful. They may have trouble living up to this film if a franchise begins, but they certainly don't need to re-re-reboot Superman again: they nailed it. Plus, Henry Cavill is a great Clark Kent.  Hopefully the Warner studio can resist the temptation to make the next film into an overwrought epic that brings Superman's story to a grand, premature conclusion (the curse of Hollywood superfilm scripts) and just have Superman have one adventure after another, and shed some of the darker psychological overtones. If they can sustain this level of impact and excitement, I'll go to as many of these films as they can make. I suspect I'm not the only person who feels this way.

1561445,A2Z65D8FBYDY63,B008JFUPFI,Donald J. Wurzelbacher,"[4, 7]","There have been numerous opinions about positive and negative points dealing with this film. No movie will ever be perfect and please everyone but I have to applaud Zack Schneider for giving us a new vision of Superman never seen on screen before. When 'Superman Returns' came out in 2006 most fanboys were screaming about having no action in the film. ""Superman didn't even throw a punch"" was a common critique. Well, WB heard their complaints and made a 180 degree turnaround. As far as I'm concerned, they went from one extreme to the other. I've described this film to others as a rollercoaster ride that rarely stops. It's shocking how much is thrown at you during the course of this story.You will not see a Clark Kent with perfect parents who bake apple pies and have the perfect answers for any questions Clark has. You will not see a completely happy childhood where little Clark has no real cares and worries until his father dies. You will not find a Superman who has all of the answers of exactly what he needs to do to solve a problem. This is a movie where Clark is uncertain who he is and doesn't necessarily want to have his powers and abilities that set him apart from everyone else causing him to be a target by others. He learns how to control his anger with people he would be able to turn into a pretzel if he wanted to. He does not know how to deal with another kryptonian named Zod who wishes to rule planet earth. He just knows he needs to stop him from this alien invasion.There are a few scenes that I believe were inspired partially from the Avengers. When Superman is handcuffed and marched into custody it is almost exactly the kind of shot used when Loki was marched to his cell in the Avengers. Near the end of the film there is an invasion that also takes me back to be Avengers inspired. Is that bad? I would say no. Zack Schneider had a tremendous undertaking to take a hero who was losing interest to Batman and give him a huge comeback while also setting up a DC universe of films at the same time.There were big changes made to Superman's origin story. There are changes in how his father dies. His fortress of solitude is very different than what you imagine in any other Superman film before it. But none of these things take away from the identity of the character of Superman. Only people like me who grew up with the Reeve version may try to compare films like this.Of course, there is an extremely controversial ending. If you don't know what I mean, this is a SPOILER ALERT.... Superman makes the ultimate life or death decision to either allow Zod to continue his mission of death to all humans or stop him. In one pivotal scene he makes the quick decision to break Zod's neck rather than allow him to do any more killing and destruction. Some people were screaming how Superman doesn't kill. They need to realize that Superman has killed before. For goodness sakes, he fought and killed Doomsday in the comics. In Superman II he allows the three Kryptonian villains to fall to their death. In Schneider's world Superman doesn't have the hard and fast rule that you NEVER take a life. He made this decision based on the basis of a killer who cannot be killed. And now he will live with it for the rest of his life. For this Superman, it probably is the origin of the no-kill rule. It's going to be interesting to find out how they deal with this in the next installment.I loved the casting. Russell Crow is a wonderful Jor El. There are also ties to other Superman shows. Diane Lane was in ""Hollywoodland"" where she played the girlfriend of George Reeves, the actor who portrayed Superman in the 1950s. By the way, I also was very excited to find out Ben Affleck will be Batman in the sequel because he played George Reeves in the previously mentioned movie and donned a Superman costume. Lois Lane Amy Adams was in the first season of Smallville. For me it was just fun to watch these characters who had a Superman connection previously.Was it a perfect film? No. Name one film that is. But it does do justice to the world's first Superhero and tried to find a balance between the darkness of Batman and the opposite brightness of Superman. This movie is not a bright one like the previous films. It is shot in a grittier fashion. For those seeking a Superman film with bright scenes and beautiful colors, you won't find it here. Go back to the Reeve films. But Superman is finally given a story that many fans have been waiting a very long time to see. I think it's a very well done film and I hope you do too. Superman flies high and seems to relate to what happens in today's world. I enjoyed it and am looking forward to the sequel in 2015.",5,From one extreme to the other,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,4690,"['have', 'been', 'numerous', 'opinions', 'positive', 'negative', 'points', 'dealing', 'film', 'movie', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'perfect', 'please', 'everyone', 'have', 'applaud', 'Zack', 'Schneider', 'giving', 'new', 'vision', 'Superman', 'never', 'seen', 'screen', 'before', 'When', ""'Superman"", 'Returns', 'came', '2006', 'most', 'fanboys', 'were', 'screaming', 'having', 'action', 'film', 'Superman', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'throw', 'punch', 'was', 'common', 'critique', 'Well', 'WB', 'heard', 'complaints', 'made', '180', 'degree', 'turnaround', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'went', 'one', 'extreme', 'other', ""'ve"", 'described', 'film', 'others', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'rarely', 'shocking', 'how', 'much', 'thrown', 'course', 'story.You', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'perfect', 'parents', 'who', 'bake', 'apple', 'pies', 'have', 'perfect', 'answers', 'questions', 'Clark', 'will', 'not', 'see', 'completely', 'happy', 'childhood', 'where', 'little', 'Clark', 'real', 'cares', 'worries', 'father', 'dies', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'Superman', 'who', 'answers', 'exactly', 'what', 'do', 'solve', 'problem', 'movie', 'where', 'Clark', 'uncertain', 'who', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'want', 'have', 'powers', 'abilities', 'set', 'apart', 'everyone', 'else', 'causing', 'be', 'target', 'others', 'how', 'control', 'anger', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'turn', 'pretzel', 'wanted', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'kryptonian', 'named', 'Zod', 'who', 'rule', 'planet', 'earth', 'just', 'stop', 'alien', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'believe', 'were', 'inspired', 'partially', 'Avengers', 'When', 'Superman', 'handcuffed', 'marched', 'custody', 'almost', 'exactly', 'kind', 'shot', 'used', 'when', 'Loki', 'was', 'marched', 'cell', 'Avengers', 'end', 'film', 'invasion', 'also', 'back', 'be', 'Avengers', 'inspired', 'bad', 'would', 'say', 'Zack', 'Schneider', 'had', 'tremendous', 'undertaking', 'take', 'hero', 'who', 'was', 'losing', 'interest', 'Batman', 'give', 'huge', 'comeback', 'also', 'setting', 'up', 'DC', 'universe', 'films', 'same', 'were', 'big', 'changes', 'made', 'Superman', 'origin', 'story', 'are', 'changes', 'how', 'father', 'dies', 'fortress', 'solitude', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'imagine', 'other', 'Superman', 'film', 'none', 'things', 'take', 'away', 'identity', 'character', 'Superman', 'Only', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Reeve', 'version', 'may', 'try', 'compare', 'films', 'this.Of', 'course', 'extremely', 'controversial', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Superman', 'ultimate', 'life', 'death', 'decision', 'allow', 'Zod', 'continue', 'mission', 'death', 'humans', 'stop', 'one', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'quick', 'decision', 'break', 'Zod', 'neck', 'rather', 'allow', 'do', 'more', 'killing', 'destruction', 'people', 'were', 'screaming', 'how', 'Superman', ""n't"", 'kill', 'need', 'realize', 'Superman', 'killed', 'before', 'goodness', 'sakes', 'fought', 'killed', 'Doomsday', 'comics', 'Superman', 'II', 'three', 'Kryptonian', 'villains', 'fall', 'death', 'Schneider', 'world', 'Superman', ""n't"", 'have', 'hard', 'fast', 'rule', 'NEVER', 'take', 'life', 'made', 'decision', 'based', 'basis', 'killer', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'killed', 'now', 'will', 'live', 'rest', 'life', 'Superman', 'probably', 'origin', 'no-kill', 'rule', 'going', 'be', 'interesting', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'deal', 'next', 'installment.I', 'loved', 'casting', 'Russell', 'Crow', 'wonderful', 'Jor', 'El', 'are', 'also', 'ties', 'other', 'Superman', 'shows', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'was', 'Hollywoodland', 'where', 'played', 'girlfriend', 'George', 'Reeves', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Superman', '1950s', 'way', 'also', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'find', 'out', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'will', 'be', 'Batman', 'sequel', 'played', 'George', 'Reeves', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'donned', 'Superman', 'costume', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'Smallville', 'was', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'characters', 'who', 'had', 'Superman', 'connection', 'previously.Was', 'perfect', 'film', 'No', 'Name', 'one', 'film', 'do', 'justice', 'world', 'first', 'Superhero', 'tried', 'find', 'balance', 'darkness', 'Batman', 'opposite', 'brightness', 'Superman', 'movie', 'not', 'bright', 'one', 'previous', 'films', 'shot', 'grittier', 'fashion', 'seeking', 'Superman', 'film', 'bright', 'scenes', 'beautiful', 'colors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'Go', 'back', 'Reeve', 'films', 'Superman', 'finally', 'given', 'story', 'many', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'see', 'think', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'hope', 'do', 'too', 'Superman', 'high', 'relate', 'what', 'today', 'world', 'enjoyed', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'sequel', '2015']",N/A

Unfortunately, they just didn't have much to work with. The first part of the movie are very brief flashbacks which have no depth and very little purpose. Seems like where theres trouble, our hero just happens to be in the neighborhood to deal with it but the disbelief and wonder of it just isn't expounded upon. We don't get to see him growing up, how he deals with everyday human issues with the powers he has and if youre looking for any of that feel good humor from the Supermans of the 80s, forget about it here. There is none, and I do mean........NONE.  Its mostly anguish and indecision and then more anguish. The second half of the movie is just another Transformers redone...............again. Blowie uppie stuff, lotsa loud noises and fires, a long fight,utter destruction and once again, Superman uses no wits, only brawn to beat the baddies.

Gone is the crystal world of Krypton and floating ghost heads. In it's place is an intriguing take on the downfall of an ancient society and the choices and struggles of young Clark Kent to either preserve his people or those of the earth. The visual presentation of Krypton is spectacular. Hans Zimmer does the unthinkable and outshines John Williams' original Superman theme. The music is superb and perfectly conveys the inner struggles of characters and drives the plot forward. A solid 5 Stars for Story and Visual & Musical Presentation.The only problem I have with this movie is the action. Yes, it's a super hero movie. Yes, Superman is supposed to be able to do everything he can do in the comics. But, this is a live action movie and not everything transfers well to real life situations. My main objection to this film is the excessively over the top fighting scenes. When CGI'd confrontations between individuals is required, credibility is instantly lost. This is the case as we watch CGI characters demolish their surroundings using each other as tools of destruction. These romp fests last way too long. When the ash and dust settle and you think the movie is over, on comes a 15 minute brawl the destroys half of metropolis. So much for Saving the day. 3 stars for over the top Action.Excessive action aside, If you loved Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy and wish for more heroes without marvel's flash and camp, this is for you.

1561453,A25B2MHTM82H4I,B008JFUPFI,dray83,"[1, 4]","First off, I have never read any reviews on &#34;Man of Steel&#34; since it was released and wanted to give it an honest chance.  I am a big fan of the Superman franchise whether it be the Christopher Reeve films, &#34;Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&#34;, Smallville and even somewhat liked Superman Returns despite its awful reviews by critics and fans alike.  The common denominator in all of those different Superman incarnations was that they all stayed true to the comics and felt authentic in their executions and portrayals.  I remembered reading IGN's preview of &#34;Man of Steel&#34; and seeing that Zack Synder wanted to make it different than the other more authentic Superman movies/series'.  While some things were okay to change[like Superman's costume] other things were simply inexcusable for me as a fan of the Superman franchise.The whole film seems like sci-fi drama mixed with action which in the end made the whole movie pointless.  The overall pace of the movie borders on intolerable and excessive especially in numerous long running action sequences.  The first 20-30 minutes of the film was focused on Krypton's destruction, which might have been nice if it didn't look like futuristic alien homages to past sci-fi action films.  If that weren't bad enough, wait there's more!  The better part of the last hour or more is solely one big action sequence between Superman[I use that term loosely here] and the Kryptonians[mostly Zod].  This isn't the Superman II action sequence most of us remember from the Christopher Reeve films which was classic not even close!  Superman of the Reeve films was all about his sense of morality and humanity when dealing with his alien foes.  He went out of his way to save the people of Metropolis from collateral damage when the fight started getting heavy.  He flew away and drew his foes into his fortress which then allowed for a smarter fight on his turf.  Not in this movie.  There are numerous people caught in the crossfire between Superman & the Kryptonians.  It is all collateral damage and action.  No forethought is given to the ensuing fight sequence and how it affects the people of Metropolis in regards to Superman's strong morality and sense of being a protector[which super heroes do, btw].  The least of all these evils is that Superman breaks one of his cardinal no-noes and KILLS Zod.  Superman stands for all that is right and moral, yet he has to kill Zod to defeat him which is simply unacceptable as a fan of this series and pretty much crushes all the things the iconic superhero stands for.  Plus, it seems like very lazy and poor storytelling.In the end, &#34;Man of Steel&#34; does not even come close to being anything resembling a Superman movie.  Everything from the look/feel of the film combined with Zack Synder taking all the liberties he did makes this film suck!  Take Zod for example.  In the Reeve film[s], Zod was a very likeable villain who people could love to hate.  His &#34;Kneel Before Zod&#34; is never even uttered in this film, which is bastardizing what Terence Stamp made Zod in that role.  In &#34;Man of Steel&#34; Zod is an impulsive psychopath who has no clever wit about him and doesn't come off as a real threat overall.  Which is another I hated about this movie: It is said over & over by Jor-El and others that Superman will defeat Zod, with no surprise in how it ends aside from the fact that Superman takes a life to save more.  Some of the concepts in this film were risky which some might see as admirable but most die-hard fans of Superman will absolutely hate!  This comes off as being a low-rent, bad imitation of a superhero movie let alone a Superman film.  It is more Avatar/Aliens meets War of the Worlds.  It is less about Superman and how he becomes a superhero and more about changing everything that made the prior version[s] of Superman what they were.  I am glad I rented this instead of going to theaters because it is exactly what I thought it was going to be: just another horrible reboot that took away the identity of what made the original[s] so great.  Zack Synder did to Superman what Rob Zombie did to the Halloween movies, which is made it something completely different than what it has always been prior to the reboot.

Naturally, that is the flick that MAN OF STEEL is going to be compared to ~ 35yrs later!  Wow, has it really been that long?As such, let's take a look at the actors.  Unlike SUPERMAN 1978, MAN OF STEEL is a star-studded venture.  Outside of Marlon Brando & Gene Hackman, most of the cast of SUPERMAN were relative unknowns.  MAN OF STEEL, on the other hand, features Russel Crowe as Jor-el, Kevin Costner & the lovely Diane Lane as the Kents and Lawrence Fishburne as Perry White.The current superhero reboot departs from the old Krypton mythology, where the red giant sun of Krypton causes the planet to explode.  Instead of its sun, it's the Kryptonians' messing with the planet's ecology that is screwing everything up (an obvious allusion to the threat of global warming here on earth).  As intelligent & sophisticated as the Kryptonians are, they have something in common with we earthlings:  a high council that bears an uncanny resemblence to our very own do-nothing congress!  Jor-el struggles to get them to ""see the light"" but his oratorical reasoning is all in vain.  Crowe does a great job of relaying a sense of frustration in a dignified manner.Costner & Lane are a perfect fit as a midwestern couple that accidentally become a part of the greatest adoption story ever told.  Also in a departure from the typical Superman mythology, they are not elderly but middle aged;  young enough to be Clark's parents rather than his grandparents.Fishburne's Perry White has more depth than the usual depiction of White as the archetypal ornery & demanding boss.  This Perry White has a paternal interest in his employees and genuinely cares about their well being.  That's new territory in a character that's mostly known more for yelling & screaming than anything else.And then, of course, we have Amy Adams as Lois Lane.  My, oh my, oh my ~ Amy Adams!!  Listen:  I actually liked Margot Kidder as Lois way-back-when, but Amy Adams is a HUGE upgrade!!  She is beautiful yet feisty, feminine yet proactive and no-nonsense.  I dare say that they could make a movie about Lois Lane & subtract Superman out of the equation altogether.  So long as Amy Adams portrayed Lois, it would fly!!  {pun intended}Finally, Henry Cavill nailed the part of Kal-el / Clark Kent.  He has a very impressive physique ~ much more buffed up than the late Christopher Reeve was in the original.  This is a very introspective story of the superhero;  a superhero who struggles & is actually pained by his attempts to gain control of his powers.  Cavill plays the shy / strong-silent type who is condemned to being a loner very well.If you're looking for a re-imagined telling of the story of Superman, then this movie is for you!  If you don't think you'll like another reboot of the Superman mythology, then I would admonish you to give this 1 a try anyway.  It's worth getting on Blu Ray for the tremendous sound quality & eye candy special effects.  That said, it's the acting & the ""different direction"" that this Superman movie takes that separates it from its predecessors.",5,Superman REALLY returns!,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,3119,"['kid', 'favorite', 'movie', 'wasSuperman', 'Movie', '1978', 'Naturally', 'flick', 'MAN', 'OF', 'STEEL', 'going', 'be', 'compared', '~', '35yrs', 'later', 'Wow', 'really', 'been', 'long', 'such', 'let', 'take', 'look', 'actors', 'SUPERMAN', '1978', 'MAN', 'OF', 'STEEL', 'star-studded', 'venture', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'most', 'cast', 'SUPERMAN', 'were', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'MAN', 'STEEL', 'other', 'hand', 'features', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'Jor-el', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'lovely', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Kents', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'Perry', 'White.The', 'current', 'superhero', 'reboot', 'departs', 'old', 'Krypton', 'mythology', 'where', 'red', 'giant', 'sun', 'Krypton', 'planet', 'explode', 'Instead', 'sun', 'Kryptonians', 'messing', 'planet', 'ecology', 'screwing', 'everything', 'up', 'obvious', 'allusion', 'threat', 'global', 'warming', 'here', 'earth', 'intelligent', 'sophisticated', 'Kryptonians', 'are', 'have', 'something', 'common', 'earthlings', 'high', 'council', 'uncanny', 'resemblence', 'very', 'own', 'do-nothing', 'congress', 'Jor-el', 'struggles', 'get', 'see', 'light', 'oratorical', 'reasoning', 'vain', 'Crowe', 'great', 'job', 'relaying', 'sense', 'frustration', 'dignified', 'manner.Costner', 'Lane', 'are', 'perfect', 'fit', 'midwestern', 'couple', 'accidentally', 'become', 'part', 'greatest', 'adoption', 'story', 'ever', 'told', 'Also', 'departure', 'typical', 'Superman', 'mythology', 'are', 'not', 'elderly', 'middle', 'aged', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'Clark', 'parents', 'rather', 'grandparents.Fishburne', 'Perry', 'White', 'more', 'depth', 'usual', 'depiction', 'White', 'archetypal', 'ornery', 'demanding', 'boss', 'Perry', 'White', 'paternal', 'interest', 'employees', 'genuinely', 'cares', 'well', 'being', 'new', 'territory', 'character', 'mostly', 'known', 'more', 'yelling', 'screaming', 'anything', 'else.And', 'then', 'course', 'have', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'My', 'oh', 'oh', '~', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Listen', 'actually', 'liked', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'Lois', 'way-back-when', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'HUGE', 'upgrade', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'feisty', 'feminine', 'yet', 'proactive', 'no-nonsense', 'dare', 'say', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'subtract', 'Superman', 'equation', 'altogether', 'So', 'long', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'portrayed', 'Lois', 'would', 'fly', 'pun', 'intended', 'Finally', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'nailed', 'part', 'Kal-el', '/', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'very', 'impressive', 'physique', '~', 'much', 'more', 'up', 'late', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'was', 'original', 'very', 'introspective', 'story', 'superhero', 'superhero', 'who', 'actually', 'pained', 'attempts', 'gain', 'control', 'powers', 'Cavill', 'shy', '/', 'strong-silent', 'type', 'who', 'condemned', 'being', 'loner', 'very', 'well.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 're-imagined', 'telling', 'story', 'Superman', 'then', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'like', 'reboot', 'Superman', 'mythology', 'then', 'would', 'admonish', 'give', '1', 'try', 'anyway', 'worth', 'getting', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'tremendous', 'sound', 'quality', 'eye', 'candy', 'special', 'effects', 'said', 'acting', 'different', 'direction', 'Superman', 'movie', 'predecessors']",N/A

Like &#34;Batman Begins&#34;, it focuses on the journey of the future superhero, investing in a serious way in the origins of Clark Kent, including the challenges of growing up different.The movie begins with the birth of Kal-El, the future Superman, on the dying planet of Krypton. A deadly feud between his father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and arch-enemy General Zod (Michael Shannon) leads to the launch of the infant Kal-El to earth. Clark Kent's difficult childhood is told grainy flashbacks as the conflicted adult Clark (Henry Cavill) wanders from job to job, performing guardian angel good deeds while seeking answers about his identity. The discovery of an ancient spacecraft in an Arctic glacier leads Clark to some of his answers, while putting him in the path of investigative reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams). Lois tracks Clark and the story of the century back to Kansas, just about the time General Zod arrives on earth. Zod will make life-changing demands of Clark; Smallville and Metropolis will become battlefields, and the Man of Steel will face tough choices.Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are wonderfully convincing as Ma and Pa Kent, teaching life lessons to the young Clark Amy Adams is a different Lois Lane, a plucky collaborator willing to give up her big story to help Clark save the world.

It was a slow night, did not feel motivated to go out, so, I decided to chance it and rent the movie for $4.99.SURPRISE!  The movie was A W E S O M E!!!This version I think heavily relates to the way he acts in the New 52! and not the classic Christopher Reeve (RIP) Gold and Silver Age comics, or even the pre-52! Superman.  This Superman feel more like an outcast and loaner than his predecessor and it shows in his behavior, the way he interacts with other kids, and really fits with the New 52! version of him before he officially becomes SUPERMAN and just wears a T-shirt with his cape.  I also was fond of how film showed more scenes from Krypton than before and how Krypton society worked.  That was a refreshing pace.  Lastly, the biggest change I thought was interesting was the choice of Superman's weakness in the movie.

Those two epic films are very hard to top, and overall, I have to say that ""Man of Steel"" doesn't step out of the Dark Knight's shadow. However, it is a solid, very good foundation. --Spoilers from here on--I enjoyed the movie's fight scenes, especially the battles in Smallville and Metropolis. I, for one, was not upset at all when Superman killed General Zod. Superman will do what he has to do in order to protect the citizens of Metropolis. Batman is the one with the no-kill rule, not Superman. And if you go back far enough in the comics, even Batman killed in the beginning. The movie was not perfect; in fact, for me the weakest point was when Jonathan Kent was standing by the cars with a tornado coming up behind him. He motions to Clark to stay put, so as not to reveal his secret. Then Jonathan stands there grinning and lets the tornado sweep him away. Rather than hobbling to the safety(?) of the overpass that was maybe 20 feet away. That made no sense to me. Even with a conveniently bad leg, he could have made it.While watching the movie, especially at the end, I couldn't help but wonder if humanity will develop a hate-fear relationship of all Kryptonians, not just Zod and his followers. After all, Metropolis and Smallville got smashed up pretty badly, and it wouldn't be unheard of for people to harbor an irrational hatred of another race. I imagine there will be some negative consequences of the giant brawl for Superman to deal with in the next film. The movie itself winks at the audience regarding a sequel, showing us a Lexcorp truck and a satellite belonging to Wayne Enterprises. Hello, Lex Luthor and Bruce Wayne!Speaking of which, I was let down to hear that the next movie will feature Superman and Batman at odds with each other. I'd much rather see them team up, because let's be honest, Batman isn't winning a fight with Superman without Kryptonite, which was never mentioned in ""Man of Steel."" I think Lex Luthor could be an epic enough villain to keep both superheroes occupied.So, to my original comment; I think that the next sequel could be a truly great movie, and that's about the only way to get people to stop comparing to the Dark Knight movies: make a movie that is decisively better.

1561483,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B008JFUPFI,Eric S. Kim,"[1, 3]","Before watching this movie, I had very modest expectations. I'm not a fan of Superman (I'm not a fan of comic books in general). I did watch the first Superman movies that starred the late Christopher Reeve, though I can't really remember since I watched them as a little kid. When Man of Steel came along, I discovered that Christopher Nolan had produced it. Seeing as how I did enjoy his Batman films, I thought I would enjoy this one. When the movie ended, I had mixed feelings.First off, I will say that the special effects are quite spectacular. The music score from Hans Zimmer was a nice touch (even if it was a little unoriginal). Director Zack Snyder and the SFX crew did a real good job with the visuals. The set and costume designs looked quite impressive, and the dialogue didn't sound too cheesy at all. The action sequences didn't tend to drag: I quite liked it. I didn't mind the inconsistent flashbacks in this movie, since I actually did follow the film very well. Henry Cavill, Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, Diane Lane, and Lawrence Fishburne gave good performances, but nothing groundbreaking.So there's that. Then, there were the things that bothered me about the film.For some reason, I didn't like Amy Adams as Lois Lane. Not only did she not look the part, but her acting seemed very wooden. I'm sure Adams is a wonderful actress; I just didn't see the evidence in this specific movie role.And speaking of Lois, the romance between Clark Kent/Superman and Ms. Lane didn't prove to be effective in this movie. I couldn't feel the chemistry between the two. I'm not sure if it's because of the way these characters were handled by the writers or the director.And oh boy, General Zod was one heck of a DULL villain. He didn't seem very threatening when onscreen, and he didn't have that authoritative appearance. Although Michael Shannon did his best with this character, I don't think I'll find Zod to be a favorite of mine anytime soon.The climax...well, it didn't have that spark that could be found in many other action films. It felt too abrupt and it lacked that epic scope that you would normally find in Batman and Avengers.Man of Steel is not really groundbreaking material. The visuals are terrific, but everything else is either average or below. It's more of a &#34;style-over-substance&#34; approach that didn't really work for this type of film. I will recommend this film to those who love Superman (and comic book franchises in general). Everyone else will probably find this one mediocre.

1561484,A36VI4D8V3B03T,B008JFUPFI,Ernie McHone,"[4, 8]","I've been a fan of Superman since before I can remember. As a child, I would immerse myself in the comic books and film series starring Christopher Reeve. Christopher Reeve was a great Superman, and nothing can change that. I don't compare Michael Keaton's Batman to Christian Bale's and I'm certainly not going to compare Christopher Reeve to Henry Cavill. That was another era and I'm thankful that he brought Superman to life for me as a child.Flash forward to 2013, the world's greatest superhero has been stagnant for the last 26 years. Superman Returns in 2006 was basically an homage to the Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve films and really didn't move the character forward in any way. Superman deserved to be brought back in style, so Warner Bros assembled Christopher Nolan, Zack Snyder and David S. Goyer to bring the story back to life. What did they accomplish? Not only the best Superman film made to date, but quite possibly the best superhero movie ever made.Regardless of what many will say, Henry Cavill brings alot to this role. His acting isn't bad or mediocre. It is excellent. He portrays Superman as the patriotic strong silent type (""I was raised in Kansas General, it doesn't get more American than that"") From his sadness as a child figuring his powers out to losing his father or his regret in killing Zod, Cavill plays it all beautifully.Many have complained about this movie being too dark and devoid of joy. The movie itself is about hope and doing the right thing when no one else wants you to. it is dark at times but there are countless joyous moments throughout the film. Just watch the scene where Superman flies for the first time or his revenge against the bully in the bar and try not to smile.The rest of the cast shine as well - Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent and Russell Crowe as Jor-el - Besides Cavill, they are the heart and soul of this film. I cheered when Jor-el showed Superman the famous symbol for the first time. His fight with General Zod is nothing short of epic. Costner, with his limited screen time could not have been a better Jonathan Kent. One of the final scenes features Jonathan watching his young son play around the yard in a homemade cape and it is powerful.Amy Adams. What can I say? The woman is gorgeous and is such a fine actress. She makes an amazing Lois Lane. Her spunk, attitude and everything is spot on from the comic books. Many have complained about her age. Don't be so shallow. Watch the movie again and you'll see she gave a fine performance.And last but not least, Michael Shannon. He was amazing as General Zod. I felt no sympathy for him. Even though the character thought he had the best interests of Krypton at heart, he really didn't. Shannon is both sad and evil at the same time.

1561485,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B008JFUPFI,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[2, 4]","&#34;Man of Steel&#34; leaps on to Blu-ray and DVD and the question on everyone's mind is, &#34;How does it hold up in a home entertainment setting?&#34; I'm happy to say it fares well and doesn't lose any of its charm or excitement. I've watched it both on a 32-inch and 45-inch TV and it held up as an emotional and action-packed rollercoaster ride filled with enough well-crafted eye-candy to stun even the most cynical CGI naysayer.Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) has known since his early childhood that he's endowed with super powers and an orphan from another planet. As he grows into manhood, he begins to drift from one job to another on his journey to discover who he is and why he's here. When the Earth is threatened by an extraterrestrial invader, Clark must embrace his destiny to save mankind from certain doom.Director Zack Snyder and writers David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan successfully update the mythology of Superman while hanging on to the classic aspects of the character that have kept him in our hearts and minds for 75 years. We might see the &#34;New 52&#34; version of the super hero visually, but he's still the same old great American Man of Steel creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster brought to the printed page in 1936. Sure, the enemies are equipped with more technology and deadlier weapons than the two-bit gangsters he went up against in the days of World War II, but he still stands for truth and justice.As a personal note, I would like to comment on the way Superman identifies himself to the military as being as American as he can be in &#34;Man of Steel.&#34; After all, he did grow up in Kansas he states. I can't help but feel this line in the film was added by Goyer to make amends for his ridiculously PC contribution to Action Comics #900. He had the hero renounce his citizenship as an American and state he was now a citizen of the world in it.The high-definition audio and video transfer for &#34;Man of Steel&#34; is pristine. The 7.1 surround sound drops the viewer right into the center of all the action and successfully transports you to the faraway world of Krypton. The picture is vivid and clear, showing off the incredible mind-blowing special effects. It's amazing how real everything looks in the CGI-heavy battle scenes.Besides some bad language and violence, &#34;Man of Steel&#34; is perfect for the whole family. It is a darker take on Superman than we've seen in the past. The moral messages of standing up for what is right and striving to be good in the face of great evil is still found.There are many references to Christianity made as well. Our hero begins his life of crime-fighting in the public eye at 33 years old, which is the time Jesus is said to have embarked on his ministry. Another example is how he spreads out his arms like Christ on the cross just as he sweeps down to save Lois Lane and the entire world from Zod and his forces.The Blu-ray version of &#34;Man of Steel&#34; includes a few special features. &#34;Journey of Discovery: Creating 'Man of Steel'&#34; is over two and a half hours of supplemental material, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and interviews you can take in while watching the film. It also includes four other featurettes that explore the making of the film and delve into the characters and Krypton. There's also a six minute featurette entitled &#34;New Zealand: Home to Middle Earth.&#34; Apparently, Warner Bros. feels it's necessary to constantly remind us that &#34;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&#34; is coming out soon.&#34;Man of Steel&#34; is a pleasing addition to any comic book movie enthusiast's home entertainment library. Consumers will find it to be a worthy purchase because of a great feature film and plenty of bonus material to be excited about. While not as epic as &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; trilogy, it will definitely stand as a fine example of super hero movies for years to come.",4,&#8220;Man of Steel&#8221; Flies into Homes on Blu-ray,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,3918,"['34', 'Man', 'Steel', '34', 'leaps', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'question', 'everyone', 'mind', '34', 'How', 'hold', 'up', 'home', 'entertainment', 'setting', '34', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'well', ""n't"", 'lose', 'charm', 'excitement', ""'ve"", 'watched', '32-inch', '45-inch', 'TV', 'held', 'up', 'emotional', 'action-packed', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'filled', 'enough', 'well-crafted', 'eye-candy', 'stun', 'even', 'most', 'cynical', 'CGI', 'naysayer.Clark', 'Kent', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'known', 'early', 'childhood', 'endowed', 'super', 'powers', 'orphan', 'planet', 'manhood', 'drift', 'one', 'job', 'journey', 'discover', 'who', 'why', 'here', 'When', 'Earth', 'threatened', 'extraterrestrial', 'invader', 'Clark', 'must', 'embrace', 'destiny', 'save', 'mankind', 'certain', 'doom.Director', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'writers', 'David', 'S.', 'Goyer', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'successfully', 'update', 'mythology', 'Superman', 'hanging', 'classic', 'aspects', 'character', 'have', 'kept', 'hearts', 'minds', '75', 'years', 'might', 'see', '34', 'New', '52', '34', 'version', 'super', 'hero', 'visually', 'still', 'same', 'old', 'great', 'American', 'Man', 'Steel', 'creators', 'Jerry', 'Siegel', 'Joe', 'Shuster', 'brought', 'printed', 'page', '1936', 'Sure', 'enemies', 'are', 'equipped', 'more', 'technology', 'deadlier', 'weapons', 'two-bit', 'gangsters', 'went', 'up', 'days', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'still', 'truth', 'justice.As', 'personal', 'note', 'would', 'like', 'comment', 'way', 'Superman', 'military', 'as', 'being', 'as', 'American', 'can', 'be', '34', 'Man', 'Steel.', '34', 'did', 'grow', 'up', 'Kansas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'line', 'film', 'was', 'added', 'Goyer', 'make', 'amends', 'ridiculously', 'PC', 'contribution', 'Action', 'Comics', '900', 'had', 'hero', 'renounce', 'citizenship', 'American', 'state', 'was', 'now', 'citizen', 'world', 'it.The', 'high-definition', 'audio', 'video', 'transfer', '34', 'Man', 'Steel', '34', 'pristine', '7.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'viewer', 'right', 'center', 'action', 'successfully', 'transports', 'faraway', 'world', 'Krypton', 'picture', 'vivid', 'clear', 'showing', 'off', 'incredible', 'mind-blowing', 'special', 'effects', 'amazing', 'how', 'real', 'everything', 'CGI-heavy', 'battle', 'bad', 'language', 'violence', '34', 'Man', 'Steel', '34', 'perfect', 'whole', 'family', 'darker', 'take', 'Superman', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'moral', 'messages', 'standing', 'up', 'what', 'right', 'striving', 'be', 'good', 'face', 'great', 'evil', 'still', 'are', 'many', 'references', 'Christianity', 'made', 'well', 'hero', 'life', 'crime-fighting', 'public', 'eye', '33', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'Jesus', 'said', 'have', 'embarked', 'ministry', 'example', 'how', 'out', 'arms', 'Christ', 'cross', 'just', 'down', 'save', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'entire', 'world', 'Zod', 'forces.The', 'Blu-ray', 'version', '34', 'Man', 'Steel', '34', 'few', 'special', 'features', '34', 'Journey', 'Discovery', 'Creating', ""'Man"", 'Steel', '34', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'supplemental', 'material', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'interviews', 'can', 'take', 'watching', 'film', 'also', 'four', 'other', 'featurettes', 'explore', 'making', 'film', 'delve', 'characters', 'Krypton', 'also', 'six', 'minute', 'featurette', 'entitled', '34', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Home', 'Middle', 'Earth.', '34', 'Apparently', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'necessary', 'constantly', 'remind', '34', 'Hobbit', 'Desolation', 'Smaug', '34', 'coming', 'out', 'soon.', '34', 'Man', 'Steel', '34', 'pleasing', 'addition', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'enthusiast', 'home', 'entertainment', 'library', 'Consumers', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'great', 'feature', 'film', 'plenty', 'bonus', 'material', 'be', 'excited', 'not', 'as', 'epic', '34', 'Dark', 'Knight', '34', 'trilogy', 'will', 'definitely', 'stand', 'fine', 'example', 'super', 'hero', 'movies', 'years', 'come']",N/A

1561491,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B008JFUPFI,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[1, 4]","Contains Minor Spoilers... I guess.Ahh yes, ""Superman"", that movie that brought such joy to my childhood. I still remember those vivid memories of ""Superman"" airing on TV and the next morning, it is all we talked about in school and during recess. ""My favorite scene was when Louis fell from the helicopter and Superman caught her""... ""yeah, mine too""... ""and when he makes time go backwards"" .. ""yeah, that was so cool"". The memories. It was an event. Unfortunately those are moments now frozen in time and I can now forgive the incredibly bad sequels (minus Superman II which despite some obnoxious humor, was a good, solid entry).Now the newer generation has ""Man of Steel"" (and to a lesser degree ""Superman Returns"" - 2006 but it seems to be forgotten now). I dunno. There is something missing in this film. I am not sure what it is exactly. It is bigger, louder, over-blown, sometimes numbing but this should be expected from an action film that boasts a $225 million budget, and it does have a heart .. buried somewhere underneath all of the chaos but this was not the Superman I enjoyed as a youngster. The characters are different and this includes our hero. The movie is a lot darker, it possesses no sense of humor or light weight moments that made the original so charming (the sequels would over-do it to a ridiculous degree) and our hero's flaming red trunks are a thing of the past (this may be the one good thing about this re-visioning).After several scenes in the prologue showing us the origins of Kal-El, the imprisonment of Zod and the destruction of Krypton, the story deals with Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman (played as an adult by Henry Cavill), ""finding himself' on earth. The villains, the megalomaniacal General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his obedient army, who were previously trapped in the Phantom Zone and managed to escape, travel to earth in search of Kal-El. Wanting to turn earth, at the expense of all its citizens, into Krypton, it all turns catastrophic when Superman refuses to co-operate and much havoc and destruction ensues. Our protagonist, Clark Kent is emotional, constantly struggling with himself and his extraordinary abilities throughout his life, but at times, it got a little silly where I started yelling at the scream ""oh boo-hoo, you have super powers, deal with it and move on already"". Clark's father, Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) is even worse. He is fearful that his special son will be rejected by society since they will be unable to understand his origins, his powers and prefers that Kent keeps this side of himself hidden until, I guess, the right time comes along *rollseyes*. The issues I have with several of these scenes lie with the writers and I do not fault the actors since they did a great job with the material given, for instance Cavill and Costner are both good in their roles, but there are moments I simply did not like. Due to spoilers, I will not discuss in more details.Others in the cast include the always compelling Russell Crowe who is great as Kal-El's original father Jor-El. Diane Lane plays Martha Kent, Clark's earth mother. You know you are getting old when you are you watching an actress whom you had greatly admired in ""Streets of Fire"" back in 1984, and she now appears before you complete with some added wrinkles and grey hairs, yikes ... but Lane is still gorgeous and she brings some much needed heart and soul to the movie. Lois Lane is played by Amy Adams. At first I was a bit hesitant since Adams is as far away from Margot Kidder as you can possibly get, however as the film moves along, her character grows on you. She is one of the stronger characters here and her Lois is no weakling. She possesses no humor, I guess the film's tone leaves no room for it, and she is more of a help to Superman (and to mankind) than a hindrance, and I have to admit, the old school Lois Lane was a bit loopy but the charm that made the original cinematic character enduring is sadly missing.Part of me liked that the film deviates from the source material and the original 1978 film. I guess this film serves as the introduction to Superman, dealing mostly with his life in his home-town, his relationship with his earth parents, his odd jobs etc. His powers are also discovered by many, so despite his many aliases, his true identity is not really a secret. Where I found this film lost it was during the far too many prolonged fight sequences showing these all too powerful aliens constantly throwing each other through structures and buildings with far too many explosions and crumbling skyscrapers. Yes, I understand I live in a time where audiences expect more from our super-heroes than simply saving a frightened kitty cat from a tree and throwing a villain who resembles Maurice Gibb from the Bee Gees into a giant, illuminated ""Coca-Cola"" sign, especially when that super hero is the titular character in a $225 million dollar production but the destruction in this film was a bit far-fetched and reminiscent of ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Independence Day"" with probably millions dead. I also would have preferred a shorter running time as the CGI fight scenes went on far too long. I am fully aware that you cannot make a super-hero movie without the use, or over-use of CGI, but let's be honest with ourselves, there was not one fight sequence that looked remotely realistic and for several seconds, or minutes of screen time, it looked like I was watching a video game.I have mixed emotions about ""Man of Steel"". Despite too much CGI, the film looks good on a technical level and it is an interesting re-visioning of the Superman tale. I thought Cavill did a good job in the role, definitely an improvement over Brandon Routh. I also liked Adams' Lois Lane and Shannon was fantastic as General Zod but it is over-done and without much character development and none of the original films charm, it drags in parts. Special effects alone do not a great movie make and the numbing effects here over shadow the actors. There are far too many fight scenes, far too much CGI, far too many explosions and it all left me with one big, terrible headache and very little else. Didn't anyone learn from ""Transformers 2""? I don't think I cared enough about these characters to re-watch this a second time which is a shame, since, despite its flaws and period stamp, I've managed to re-watch the original ""Superman"" and ""Superman II"" countless times throughout 3 decades.Still, it's action packed and there are worst ways to kill 142 minutes.",3,War of the Worlds,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,6524,"['Contains',

1561492,A36NMMVWY6BP1V,B008JFUPFI,evani1997,"[3, 7]","Honestly, I've never been that big of a Superman fan. I liked him in the Justice League show, and I liked the Christopher Reeve version, but my opinion never reached much farther than &#34;liked.&#34; Man of Steel, however, looks to change that.The origin story is very similar to what we've previously seen. Krypton is dying, so Jor-El sends his newborn son into space to live among the humans. This son gets raised by two Kansans: Jonathan and Martha Kent. He later discovers that earth's sun gives him superpowers. Long story short, he becomes Superman. These aspects are the same as any other Superman origin story. However, several little details are changed. To avoid spoilers, I'm not going to go into them. These changes that I'm going to avoid mentioning really advance and dramatize the classic story, as did Batman Begins and The Amazing Spider-Man.One of the things I particularly liked was the characters. Superman is very similar to what we normally see, although I sympathize with him easier. I really like Henry Cavill's performance, and I would say that this is by far my favorite version of Superman. With him as Superman,Christian Bale as Batman, and Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man, I'm starting to believe that British actors playing the lead is like good luck when it comes to superhero movies. Other characters such as Perry White who didn't stick out to me before are really good characters in this one. Jor-El, being played by Russell Crowe, much cooler than any other version of him. Speaking of which, the fact that this movie could get acting legends Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner is quite surprising. Another notable character change is Lois Lane. In pretty much every version previously, I've never liked her. She was generally very screamy. This one is actually not annoying, and at least tolerable. Amy Adams' performace surprised me, because she usually plays very lighthearted characters.Like the Dark Knight trilogy, Hans Zimmer does the music to this film and, as expected, makes an epic soundtrack. Though it consists of sounds that sound like the same instruments of the Dark Knight soundtrack, the sound is very much different, with a more lively, exciting sound to it.What surprised me the most about this movie was the action scenes. Superman, at least to my knowledge, isn't generally known for his action scenes. That being said, I didn't think Superman could ever have a cool action sequence. Man of Steel not only proved me wrong, but proved that Superman could have some of the coolest action scenes in the history of ever! The final battle scene in particular rivals action scenes from any of the Transformers movies and The Avengers.Man of Steel is pretty much the best thing to happen to Superman in a long time. The characters and story are great, the soundtrack is very cool, and the action and special effect are phenomenal. This movie turned Superman into one of my favorite superheroes. I would highly recommend this to any fan of Superman or just superheroes in general.Final Score: 8.9/10",4,Excellent Adaption,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,3044,"['Honestly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'Superman', 'fan', 'liked', 'Justice', 'League', 'show', 'liked', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'version', 'opinion', 'never', 'reached', 'much', 'farther', '34', '34', 'Man', 'Steel', 'however', 'change', 'that.The', 'origin', 'story', 'very', 'similar', 'what', ""'ve"", 'previously', 'seen', 'Krypton', 'dying', 'Jor-El', 'sends', 'newborn', 'son', 'space', 'live', 'humans', 'son', 'raised', 'two', 'Kansans', 'Jonathan', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'later', 'earth', 'sun', 'superpowers', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'Superman', 'aspects', 'are', 'same', 'other', 'Superman', 'origin', 'story', 'However', 'several', 'little', 'details', 'are', 'changed', 'avoid', 'spoilers', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'changes', ""'m"", 'going', 'avoid', 'mentioning', 'really', 'advance', 'dramatize', 'classic', 'story', 'did', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Amazing', 'Spider-Man.One', 'things', 'particularly', 'liked', 'was', 'characters', 'Superman', 'very', 'similar', 'what', 'normally', 'see', 'sympathize', 'easier', 'really', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'performance', 'would', 'say', 'far', 'favorite', 'version', 'Superman', 'Superman', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'Batman', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'Spider-Man', ""'m"", 'starting', 'believe', 'British', 'actors', 'playing', 'lead', 'good', 'luck', 'when', 'superhero', 'movies', 'Other', 'characters', 'such', 'Perry', 'White', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'stick', 'out', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'characters', 'one', 'Jor-El', 'being', 'played', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'much', 'cooler', 'other', 'version', 'Speaking', 'fact', 'movie', 'could', 'get', 'acting', 'legends', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'quite', 'surprising', 'notable', 'character', 'change', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'pretty', 'much', 'version', 'previously', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'was', 'generally', 'very', 'screamy', 'one', 'actually', 'not', 'annoying', 'least', 'tolerable', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'performace', 'surprised', 'usually', 'very', 'lighthearted', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'trilogy', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'music', 'film', 'expected', 'epic', 'soundtrack', 'sounds', 'sound', 'same', 'instruments', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'soundtrack', 'sound', 'very', 'much', 'different', 'more', 'lively', 'exciting', 'sound', 'it.What', 'surprised', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'action', 'scenes', 'Superman', 'least', 'knowledge', ""n't"", 'generally', 'known', 'action', 'scenes', 'being', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Superman', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'cool', 'action', 'sequence', 'Man', 'Steel', 'not', 'only', 'proved', 'wrong', 'proved', 'Superman', 'could', 'have', 'coolest', 'action', 'scenes', 'history', 'ever', 'final', 'battle', 'scene', 'particular', 'rivals', 'action', 'scenes', 'Transformers', 'movies', 'Avengers.Man', 'Steel', 'pretty', 'much', 'best', 'thing', 'happen', 'Superman', 'long', 'time', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'cool', 'action', 'special', 'effect', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'movie', 'turned', 'Superman', 'one', 'favorite', 'superheroes', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fan', 'Superman', 'just', 'superheroes', 'general.Final', 'Score', '8.9/10']",N/A

I love the Nolan Batman films and as I think most people will agree Superman Returns was a fun but very weak attempt to recreate the Reeve years.Kevin Spacey is an amazing actor but completely wasted in that film because all he did was ape Gene Hackman's portrayal when he could have been saved for this franchise and been the most menacing Luthor ever.Man Of Steel to me is the perfect flipside of the coin to Batman Begins, while Batman is an intellectual and uses mostly his brain Superman is the brawn and while the Dark Knight Trilogy is mostly a drama Man Of Steel is mostly an action film.I love THIS Superman and Cavill is perfectly cast as is Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and the rest... THIS is the Superman we finally deserve.The only thing to ruin it is the casting of Ben Affleck as Batman in the forthcoming sequel ... Christian Bale really should be back in the cape & cowl again for Man Of Steel or whatever it is called.But this Man Of Steel it seems is already going to be another stand alone movie because I'm certainly not interested in seeing Ben Affleck as Batman in the sequel... it really is a pity because Man Of Steel complimented Batman Begins so well, just as Batman and Superman should be: opposite sides of the same coin.Light and dark, day and night, hope and obsession...I was so happy when I saw MOS steel in the cinema and saw it 5 times, it's not my favorite action film or even comic book movie but I agree with another reviewer on here that has said people can't seem to make up their mind what they want in a Superman film.It will never be Christopher Reeve again, and they already tried that and failed with Superman Returns. I loved MOS because it was a reinvention of the cinematic version of the character exactly the same that Batman Begins was a reinvention of Batman and both work wonderfully.Man Of Steel was also more than just a new Superman movie, I'm not religious but the allegory to Christ was unmistakable giving the story layers and comparing Superman/Clark Kent to Jesus Chris has been in the comics for decades...Also, and no one else seems to see this besides Man Of Steel being a great Superman film it is also in its own right the best science fiction movie I've seen in a very long time.If you watch The Day The Earth Stood Still, MOS has many themes very similar to that classic of science fiction. The outsider/alien who tries to save humanity because although he will never truly be a part of it connects with a few individuals who show him that humankind are worth preserving.The invasion of earth and the uncaring tidal force that threatens humanity, and I'm talking the original classic TDTESS not the Keanue Reeves terrible remake movie.Lois in Man Of Steel is like the mother in TDTESS and Kal-El is Kaatu while te Kryptonians and especially Zod of course are akin to Gort... there are so many layers to Man Of Steel that make more than simply an ""action movie"" or a ""superhero"" movie that blows Superman Returns out of the park.The journey of Kal-El from childhood to adulthood, the Christ allegory, in many ways a much better remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still.This is an intelligent, remarkable, entertaining film filled with action, romance, comedy, wit and even tragedy when Kal-El is forced to decide between his own people who he has sought his entire life and the human race.Do not underestimate MAN OF STEEl, it is a movie worth watching many times over because of all those reasons and more.I do love how Lois and Clarks relationship is subtle, these characters are just meeting for the first time. They don't have time to fall in love yet but they are attracted to each other...Give MAN OF STEEL a chance, it's just a terrible shame that WB and Chris Nolan and Zack Snyder aren't doing everything humanly possible to get Christian Bale to come back for MAN OF STEEL II.",5,"Man Of Steel is the perfect flipside to Batman Begins, too bad its ruined...",1384128000,"11 11,

1561497,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008JFUPFI,FNDNreview,"[41, 122]","Over the years, the Superman franchise has had its share of hits and misses - both on the big screen and the little screen.  Depending on who was wearing the cape, Superman has soared to the amazement of viewers, and also crashed and burned, falling out of favor with fans and ending with cancellation.  George Reeves was nearly every child's idol in the 1950s.  In the late 1970s and 80s, Christopher Reeve did such a tremendous job with the iconic red and blue character that it's quite possible no one will ever wear the cape quite as well again.  Through the 1990s and 2000s, Dean Cain and Tom Welling kept Superman alive on TV, while the Superman film franchise lay in ruins, desperate for someone to return the character to prominence.  In 2006, Bryan Singer did an admirable job, casting Brandon Routh as the lead, yet the film never quite clicked with Superman fans.  Now, seven years later - director Zach Snyder and the man responsible for Batman's return to fame, Christopher Nolan, have completely re-imagined a modern Superman.  Will the summer of 2013 belong to the Man of Steel, or is this just another poorly executed effort that fails to find the essence of the greatest comic book character of all-time?Directed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen), Man of Steel stars Henry Cavill as Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El, an alien sent to earth from a dying world.  As a child, Clark Kent desperately tries to fit in, even though he has extraordinary super powers.  As an adult, he must either embrace the idea that he's humanity's protector, or risk watching the earth be destroyed by the arrival of General Zod (Michael Shannon) - a Kryptonian criminal hell-bent on repopulating his race on earth.  Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Antje Traue, and Russell Crowe also star in supporting roles.It's a travesty to watch a character so engrained in American culture treated in such a poor, careless manner.  Man of Steel is an absolute mess and you can place the blame squarely on the writer and director.  Christopher Nolan and David Goyer may have had a pulse on Batman in The Dark Knight trilogy, but as far as Superman goes - they should be ashamed of themselves and never be allowed to touch this character ever again.  Director Zack Snyder completely misses the mark, spending the majority of his time focused on uninteresting spaceships and the endless amount of buildings falling down.  Snyder completely sacrifices screen time that would have been much better spent establishing characters, including but not limited to Lois Lane, Martha Kent, Perry White, and the completely absent Jimmy Olson.  And, don't even both with that ""we were saving him until the sequel"" crap because Jimmy Olson is just as important to Superman lore as Lois Lane, Smallville, and Krypton.  Superman Returns was a flawed film, but at least that film took the time to incorporate the important aspects of the Superman universe.Who is this Superman in Man of Steel?  He's certainly nobody you'll recognize from the comic books, previous films, or basically any other variation of the character.  For instance, someone needs to explain the logic behind the most powerful superhero on the planet being forced to hitchhike.  It defies comprehension how in the snap of a finger this character can be on the other side of the world, yet when a bar rat half his size gets under his skin, his first reaction is to quit his job and hitchhike to the next town (and no, it doesn't make up for such a ridiculous idea even if the truck says LexCorp on it).  While we're on the subject, why is Superman working in a bar?  You have to be kidding with this stuff.  Not only has Superman worked in a bar, he's also tried his hand at being a sea fisherman, too.  Feel free to drop your jaw and say, ""huh?""  These are just the small, tiny nuances that will make you want to scratch your head.  We haven't even got to the completely flawed decision that Superman makes at the end of the film, which completely goes against every single standard set for the character since his creation.  Suddenly, the decision to make Superman a parent (Superman Returns) doesn't seem like the dumbest decision ever made.Superman is a character with near limitless power at his disposal, yet he fails to use half of his abilities in the film for more than mere instances.  Several attributes, like his x-ray vision, heat vision, and superhuman hearing are briefly displayed, while one of his most prominent powers, super breath, is nonexistent.  This superhero is supposed to be invulnerable, but somehow manages to spend the majority of this film getting beat up and knocked down, not just by his fellow Kryptonians, but also by bullies at school.  For a reboot film that is meant to establish Superman as a character to be feared, he certainly doesn't stand out above any of the other countless Kryptonians that manage to find their way to earth.  Superman is a character of standards, standing prominently in the defense of humanity, but his human side appears to dominate his thoughts, showing little interest in preserving the future of his native people.  Sadly, it's hard to call him anything other than slightly above average in Man of Steel.Even though the plot is complete trash and does absolutely nothing for the advancement of the DC Cinematic Universe, the film is not devoid of a few shining stars.  Did you ever imagine Russell Crowe or Kevin Costner wouldn't bring their A-game for this film?  As the fathers of Kal-El/Clark Kent, these two masterful actors display a complete understanding of their characters, quickly establishing that they are out to nudge their son in the right direction, ultimately leaving Clark to decide the man he wants to be.  Michael Shannon is no Terence Stamp, but he does mold the role of the vengeful, angry General Zod into his own, creating a grander villain as opposed to the character Stamp displayed in Superman and Superman II.  And, while we're on the subject of Zod - sadly, there's no classic ""kneel before Zod"" quote to look forward to in this disappointing film.As far as the rest of the cast goes, they are basically average at best.  Henry Cavill brings the attractive features to the role of Superman, but he suffers from the same fate as his predecessor (Brandon Routh) - a proper dialogue for the character.  He's a far cry Christopher Reeve, not to mention Tom Welling.  Superman's romance interest, Lois Lane, ineloquently follows the gigantic breadcrumbs right to the front door of the Kent farm, eliminating any possibility of future quirky exchanges between Lois and Clark at the Daily Planet with Superman (disguised) staring her right in the face.  Speaking of the Planet, Laurence Fishburne showed such great potential in the role of the Planet's editor, Perry White, but is left to flounder around for more than half of the film due to yet another nauseating and destructive alien invasion.  This all just goes to show you that no matter how many high profile names are in your film, they all look foolish without an interesting story and progressive dialogue.With an array of villains in Superman's rough gallery, it's unfortunate that the writers and filmmakers choose to go with another General Zod story.  Man of Steel feels much more like a Brainiac story than a Kryptonian origin story, leaving far too many questions unanswered.  The countless blunders of this film compared to previous comic book failures, like Ang Lee's Hulk and Green Lantern.  Speaking of the green guardian, there is no mention of him or any other major characters from the DC Universe - meaning there's absolutely no lead-in to a potential Justice League film or a Batman/Superman team-up.  Allegedly, there's a Wayne Enterprises logo on a satellite during the film, but if that's the best they can do for a reference, that's just sad and bothersome - which is basically the overlying theme of this film anyway.Overall, Man of Steel is one of the worst comic book films to date.  Not only did they do away with John Williams' famous theme music, the filmmakers completely failed to make Superman interesting and frankly, they obviously don't understand the character at all.  This all comes as a bit of a shock, but there it is in all of its CGI-abusive glory.  Granted, Superman's costume looks great and his origin remains intact, but that doesn't change the fact that this film is too long, bumbling from the get-go, and a complete misrepresentation of the Superman character.  In any event, a Man of Steel sequel has apparently been fast-tracked, so we're apparently stuck with Zack Snyder and his poor re-imagining of Superman.  Hopefully a sequel can right the ship before we're forced to go another seven years without a Superman flick.Overall Grade:  D-FNDNreview.com",1,'Man of Steel' fails to depict the essence of

1561500,A3UHRZG3CS022C,B008JFUPFI,"frankbif ""frankbif""","[8, 14]","I'm not a comic book aficionado.  I grew up with cartoons in the 1960's and 1970's and leaned more to DC Comics than Marvel, but even I had to say that up to the BATMAN re-boot with the Nolan Trilogy, Marvel films were better action and better stories.  But MAN OF STEEL comes up to bat and while it might not be a grand slam, it is certainly a home run.Zach Snyder and Christopher Nolan have added a new layer of complexity to the Superman storyline, while still allowing for character development, action, and a storyline that stays true to the original mythology.  Henry Cavill (Superman/Clark Kent), Amy Adams (Lois Lane; she had an appearance as a villain in ""SMALLVILLE""), Michael Shannon (Zod), and Diane Lane (Martha Kent) all give great appearances in their roles, big or small.  Russell Crowe is a fantastic and very believable Jor-El; let's hope they can re-utilize him in future DC Comics/SUPEMAN/Justice League sequels.MOS is a unique film compared to previous Superman storylines.  From the 1951 ""ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN"" through the cartoons of the 1960's and 1970's to the 1978 SUPERMAN film with Christopher Reeve to the recent SMALLVILLE TV series, every showing of Superman has shown Superman advancing in chronological order, usually from birth/his appearance on Earth.  But MOS took a different tack which makes the film very interesting, where series of flashbacks (like dream sequences) from Clark's time on Earth are interspersed with the main storyline.  So you see a very young Clark in school, an adolescent Clark saving a school bus, an early-20's Clark working at a bar, Clark on a fishing vessel, and the death of Jonathan Kent (great performance by Kevin Costner) at different times in the film, seemingly popping up at random.  It accentuates the importance of these events in the younger Clark's life and tells the story of his time on Earth in a different perspective.  The ordering of the appearances fills in the blanks and makes the story arc of the Last Son Of Krypton riveting and appealing to those who already know the Superman mythology (which is probably most of us).  Very well done !!As for the movie itself:  Jor-El and Zod's relationship is dramatic and a new twist on Zod's megalomania; it is too bad they couldn't explore this in further detail or go back in time when they were strong allies (perhaps in a sequel?).  I have always thought that a story arc focusing solely on what happened with Jor-El/Zod and the rest of Krypton before the planetary cataclysm would have made for a great storyline.  The darker tone of MOS would have lent itself more to such a story (more so than the Kryptonian Council scenes at the beginning of the 1978 SUPERMAN movie).  Pay attention to the difference in Clark's tone and attitude toward his parents when he is complaining to Jonathan Kent about following in his footsteps as a farmer, and later in the movie when he goes after Zod for 'threatening his mother.'Lois Lane's relationship to Superman is introduced in a different fashion than in previous incarnations of Superman.  Another positive; the writers and producers stayed true to the basic Superman story arc but knew they needed a few 'changeups' to make this different to captivate the audience, besides the darker tone.  Perry White's character is much less interesting (and funny) than Jackie Cooper's portrayal in the 1978 film.  But if Lawrence Fishburne is OK with it, who am I to complain ?The ending has plenty of action, and the complaints by some that there is too much rock-'em-sock-`em action is a bit off base.  This isn't the BATMAN trilogy where you are dealing with a brilliant martial arts detective, you are talking about super-powered beings whose dense molecular structures are magnified probably 1 trillion-fold by the power of Earth's Sun.  The complaint about SUPERMAN RETURNS was that the trailers had most of the action and the movie had very little follow-up.  That isn't the case in MOS.  Even little things are accentuated, as this film pays attention to detail: check out Clark's eyes when he helps heals Lois' injury.  Nice touch !Plenty of extras are to be included in the Blu-Ray version of the movie:  behind-the-scenes, deleted scenes, etc.  The move lasts 143 minutes, which is rather long, but it flows very evenly.  The movie is laid out in such a way with different `story blocs'  that it flows better than if they had followed the chronology of the 1978 movie from Clark's rocketship appearance on Earth to the present.""MAN OF STEEL"" is a great film in its own right and a worthy successor to the 1978 movie which was one of the biggest box office hits of the 1970's.  Some have commented that the ticket sales for MOS were disappointing, but it is possible that the SMALLVILLE TV series (ended 2011) and SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006) both dampened any pent-up demand for a successful and new version of the story.  BATMAN BEGINS was 8 years after the final George Clooney semi-camp Batman movie but the Nolan Trilogy didn't kick into high gear until THE DARK KNIGHT hit in 2008.  MOS did better than BATMAN BEGINS by almost 50%.  When THE DARK KNIGHT followed up BATMAN BEGINS 3 years later it more than doubled the earlier film.  One wonders if there was a Superman-only follow-up (instead of the rumored Batman-Superman ""Justice League"" hookup) if it could springboard on the first film's success and reach the levels of the 2nd and 3rd films in the Nolan Trilogy.  Looks like we'll never know, so let's hope Ben Afleck and the scriptwriters don't screw up the successor to MAN OF STEEL.",5,Steel Yourself For A Spectacular Visual Display - MOS Is A Winner

The Superman I grew up with would NEVER, EVER kill! As Kal-el says in "" Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow"" ""Nobody has the right to kill. Not MXYZPTLK, not you ( Lois ) not Superman. Especially not Superman""The DVD interview with cast and crew was ok but I was insulted as to their thinking that they, the writers, were explaining Clarks coming to grips with his being different and how this was so innovated.

1561508,A212BN81DP6FRI,B008JFUPFI,freelancer26,"[24, 39]","Seventy five years ago this month, Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster brought The Man of Steel into the world through DC Comics. Today (appropriately) on Flag Day, the first, the best imagined superhero of all time has been reintroduced to the world by director Zack Snyder, writer David Goyer, producer Christopher Nolan and personified in the perfect embodiment of Henry Cavill. ...For those wary of long reviews, here's the condensed version: WOW!!Upon watching ""Captain America the First Avenger"" two years ago, I declared it to be the best superhero movie ever made. That sentiment remained a year later after watching ""The Avengers."" No question it was FUN - magnificently made sheer escapist fantasy but it wasn't more than that. It lacked its predecessor's heart. Well, ""Man of Steel"" combines the nonstop action and state of the art special effects of The Avengers with the soul and spirit of The First Avenger (which Captain America borrowed from Superman). Here's how:- It doesn't pull any punches... Almost every aspect of this film is Academy Award worthy. While I agree that Christopher Nolan is a very competent and interesting film maker, I've always found his work muddled where the special effects take over the storytelling resulting in minimal depth and often confusing the story told. His talents were better served here in a hands off approach. I commend him for his decision to turn over creative control to Zack Snyder who clearly owns this film together with Cavill. These two men carried the initial premise of a one of a kind child born to an extraordinary couple from a race of extraordinary beings to its logical conclusion without ever flinching. There's one particular scene toward the end that made me cry like a baby for a good five minutes. It's a powerful scene in a film full of powerful scenes. I read a preliminary review a few days ago criticizing this film for lacking humanity. Now that I've seen it for myself, I couldn't disagree more. In that one scene, not only did I feel Superman's humanity but I think I understand now what it must be like for an American soldier when he/she takes up arms to defend all they love from those who promise to destroy it. The extraordinary price they pay for their patriotism and commitment is heartbreaking.- This film answers the question of which is the real man and which is the disguise... The truth is that there is no disguise. Kal-El, Clark Kent, Superman - they're all facets of the same man - all real in the context of different aspects of his life and experience. And for those who roll their eyes at the idea of a simple pair of glasses serving as a ""disguise"" ... you try it some time. You'd be surprised at how many people are willing to dismiss someone from extraordinary contention if they consistently keep themselves to behind the scenes work, don't behave in a flamboyant or even assertive manner, they don't announce everything they do and say and don't make themselves the story on social media or anywhere else. Yes. There are still people who value their privacy. Thankfully, as long as they don't show off anything that might be coveted by others, most people are very much willing to let them continue in anonymity.- Henry Cavill's performance is Perfect... I don't use this word lightly. Before today, George Reeves from the 1950's ""Adventures of Superman"" was my favorite Clark Kent and Christopher Reeve from the late 70's/80's movies was my favorite Superman. Cavill not only matches them in caliber but surpasses them in presence and personification. He is STRONG in every way. The love he oozes throughout the film makes him that much more powerful. With Snyder's guidance (similarly like Gerard Butler in ""300"") he walks the fine line of being vulnerable without ever seeming corny or weak. Besides having Kirk Alyn's earnestness, George Reeves' intelligence, Christopher Reeve's strength, Dean Cain's charm, Brandon Routh's charisma and Tom Welling's looks, Henry Cavill brings passion to the role -something that was sorely lacking all these years. (Welling did exude passion in Smallville  season 9 but in season 10 he was only able to sustain passion in his scenes with Durance.) Cavill seems to get along with his leading lady. However, as I predicted after watching the final two minutes of ""Smallville"" two years ago, no couple will ever surpass the perfect combustible chemistry of Erica Durance and Tom Welling in their combined portrayal of Lois and Clark. Durance stated that she'll never again play Lois Lane without Welling in the lead and I suspect Welling has privately made the same decision. Their commitment to each other is admirable but it is a shame we'll never see Cavill's Clark with Durance's Lois. Durance (together with Phyllis Coates) remain my favorite Lois Lane.I wasn't much of a fan of any of the supporting players before this. I particularly didn't care for Russell Crowe or Kevin Costner but by their second and third scenes, respectively, I actually forgot their previous work and accepted them as Superman's two fathers. Laurence Fishburne was really good as Perry White. I didn't mind the actress who played Ma Kent as much as I thought I might and all the Krypton and armed forces actors were excellent. Hans Zimmer music was inspired - it fit Cavill's portrayal. Surprisingly, I didn't miss John Williams' signature piece. And by the way, there are countless ""Easter eggs"" paying homage to previous Superman renditions. For example, one of the times Superman saves Lois, they land in a Kansas corn field - exactly where Lois first meets Kal-El in ""Smallville"" - only she was saving him in that version. Also, the way Jor-El and Lara launch their baby to Earth is very similar to ""Superman the Animated Series"" and the 1948 ""Superman"" theatrical serial.July 4, 2013 UPDATE: Saw this film again yesterday but in IMAX. It was really loud(!) but most everything else was as I remembered except ... This time I found myself annoyed by the actress who played Superman's Girl Friday ... she's almost as bad as the one in ""Superman Returns"" (but at least that one sort of looked the part after they put that long, dark, curly wig on her). Perhaps I didn't really pick up on it the first time because I was so focused on the main character but she was seriously miscast. Clark's partner needs to be his mortal female mirror image: tall, dark and beautiful with a temperament and physicality to match her traditional upbringing by a four star general to make her action scenes believable. Here, she just looked like a short, red-head little kid (with wrinkles) playing in her mom's high heels and holding a toy ray gun. She's a full nine years older than Cavill and looks it, too! I don't blame Zack Snyder for this. It seems Nolan cast her before Snyder was given the helm. It's too bad because Snyder knows so much more about picking leading ladies than Nolan does - just compare the female leads in ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" to those in the ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy (you'd think Nolan was allergic to beautiful women!). Regardless, I found myself inspired by Henry Cavill even more this second time around.For those involved, this film might very well end up being their magnum opus - their masterpiece. And for this film's audience - at least, for my part, I'm grateful for their excellence. For Zack Snyder and Henry Cavill in particular, Congratulations. ... And for The Man of Steel, himself ...

Why RT only gives it a 57% is a question I cannot even begin to answer.Man of Steel is the first Superman movie that's worthy of the character it portrays.  Everything about it, including the story line, the scenes, the action, the character development, and everything else is truly epic in scale.  Forget Gene Hackman in a toupee trying to drive up real estate prices.  This time the enemy is an invader from the stars who wants to wipe out humanity - and he can do it.This time Clark is so overwhelmed by the power within him that he spends years trying to figure out what to do with it. This time we have a noble yet tormented soul, who struggles with the voices calling him in a thousand different directions all at once.In short, this time we have an epic, which is exactly what the life story of an ultra-powerful messianic figure should be.  No corniness, no silliness, no flying around the earth to make time go backwards.  Oh, and no supposedly intelligent people fooled about his identity by a pair of glasses (I always hated that in the comic books).And Superman is no naive boy scout.

1561511,A17PNW5KFXRDT3,B008JFUPFI,fsnva,"[8, 17]","I am a lifelong reader of comic books and have been a viewer of every incarnation of Superman starting with George Reeves in the original TV show.  So how does MAN OF STEEL stack up when compared to its predecessors?Pretty damn good, I would say, mainly because:Plot tension: is Kal-El/Clark Kent the last son of Krypton or a freak marooned among an alien race?  This one of many questions driving David Goyer's script which tackles what it means to be an outsider and whether one's destiny is predetermined or a result of free will. This gives Superman some much needed internal conflict and a theme to drive the story.A great Superman: Henry Cavill has the looks and the physique to pull it off, but he has the talent to convey Kal-El/Clark Kent's inner battles.  Cavill has to do a lot of acting without dialogue and express a broad range of emotions with his eyes and body language.  He is far from the cipher some critics have charged him with being.  He doesn't make you forget Christopher Reeve, but perfectly compliments the earlier performance.A great villain:  Michael Shannon is a terrific General Zod, and that's not taking anything away from Terrance Stamp's version of the character.  But MAN OF STEEL manages to explain and deepen his motivation, giving his animus toward Kal-El a real edge.  All super hero movies need a great bad guy to go up against, and MAN OF STEEL really delivers in this department.Great fathers:  Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner as Jor-El and Jonathan Kent respectively.  Crowe's Jor-El sees his son as a future champion, the embodiment of all the greatness of Krypton; while Costner's Jonathan Kent raises Clark to hide his powers from a public that fears and hates what it does not understand and can't control.  And there is one hot Momma here as well as Diane Lane makes Martha Kent sexy for the fist time in a Superman movie.  (I'm not forgetting Annette O'Toole on Smallville, but that was TV.)Great battles: the final throw down between Superman and Zod makes skyscrapers crumble and the earth itself shake.  This is exactly the kind of fight we've waited years to see.  And I have no problem with the way the battle is resolved, something many Superman fans did not like.Great tweaks in the origin story: I'm not going to detail them here, but let's just say they work.  I especially like how Crowe's Jor-El was given a lot more screen time and the demise of Costner's character was changed so that it resonated more.  Lot's of die hard fans most emphatically did not like these changes, and some of them I would agree with, like when Jonathan Kent implies that Clark should have let his friends drown rather than risk revealing his powers.  Then there are those who just can't buy into ""comic book logic,"" and for them there is no help.Amy Adams is a fine actress, and she does give Lois Lane the proper amount of pushiness, but I just don't like the way the script has her simply slip onto the long buried Kryptonian ship and discover Superman's origin and identity.  At the same time I like the way the story does right by some minor characters like Pete Ross.  But where is Jimmy Olson?  I do miss some of the humor Richard Donner brought to his 1978 movie; everyone in MAN OF STEEL is very serious and very earnest.Nevertheless, MAN OF STEEL is a great reboot or re-imagining (whatever) for one of the 20th Century pop culture's greatest icons, making him relevant again in the 21st.

Denick,"[0, 0]","This is the first Superman movie I have seen where the abilities of the character (as defined in the comics and lore) are accurately depicted, and for that reason I rate it five stars. I truly felt like Superman was a demigod-like alien, as opposed to being somebody who was slapped around by Lex Luthor's humble human bodyguards (as was the case in &#34;Superman Returns&#34;). The speed, power, and energy of the last son of Krypton is truly a sight to behold in this film, and it was a stroke of genius to finally set Superman across from some enemies who could truly test his abilities. Furthermore, I feel that the actor who plays Clark Kent does a wonderful job of conveying the humility, humbleness, and strong values of the character.Christopher Nolan's cinematography style is thoroughly imprinted on this movie (and I think that's a good thing), though the tone is strikingly different from the Batman movies. This is as it should be, I feel, because the two characters play on completely different ball fields. There is no sense in pitting Superman against human sociopaths like the Joker or Scarecrow, instead it makes far more sense to have him do battle with supremely powerful alien beings and their advanced technology. Nolan and Snyder take advantage of the power at their disposal in the Superman character (finally, somebody does!), and they put on a sci-fi extravaganza that is nothing short of astounding. However, they also maintain the character's most interesting flaws, as well- his sense of uncertainty and vulnerability as he tries to find his place in a world that was never supposed to be his, but that he has come to adopt as his own.The Blu-ray transfer is top notch, with incredibly sharp visuals and great audio.

1561522,AX53DA3FTILL0,B008JFUPFI,Gene Siskel,"[41, 66]","The Good: The special effects are phenomenal. The fight scenes capture the feel of the Superman: animated series with Superman putting baddies through buildings. Henry Cavill does a solid job with what he is given to work with. From an acting standpoint, Russell Crowe is the best thing about the movie. The movie also presents some interesting twists on the mythology of Superman (or as they refer to him in this movie, Kal-El).The Bad- The plot, despite all it's tweaks to the known story is at an elementry school level. That may work for some action movies, but for Superman, with 70 years of history I expect a lot more. Here is the plot: General Zod wants to build Krypton on earth. Superman must stop him. There are no sub-plots, good dialogue, character development, and most importantly, no real emotion in this film. Superman is extremely stoic. In the far superior Christopher Reeve films (1,2), you can see Superman take joy in getting a cat out of a tree or saving a kid from plunging to his death at the Niagra falls. He throws a light-hearted quip 'Sorry, only one ride per customer' and flies off. That element was sorely lacking in this film. I guess this is the 'Nolan-ized' version of Superman. Unfortunately, brooding is not an adjective that should ever apply to Superman. So it misses by a mile in terms of characterization.The Deal: This movie is a bootleg view at best. For a movie with virtually no story, this thing drags for nearly two-and-a-half hours. The best comparsion I can make for this film is that of Star Wars: Episode II, great special effects, but you could care less what happens to any of the characters. Chris Nolan should take a break, between the overthought and convoluted 'Dark Knight Rises' and now this. It looks as if he is suffering from a case of burnout. Any chance they can reboot Superman a third time? They ain't building a franchise based on this movie. It's only marginally better than the loathed 'Superman Returns' This movie has the feel of a Michael Bay movie, explosions for the sake of explosions.  In other words, it's a dumbed down version of Superman, enjoyable special effects and some cool scenes, but I expected something that would do superman justice.

1561529,A26IVJJTXOE85B,B008JFUPFI,Georgio Alfani,"[8, 18]","This movie is completely emotionless and has no heart at all. It's like watching someone else play a video game for 2hours and 20 minutes. If you were to take out all the action this film would be 15 minutes (I'm not joking)! Even when they try to do character development...there's an action scene (seriously!) This film never slows down to develop the characters, the whole time while watching this I keep thinking ""who cares!"" I don't care about any of these characters because we never get to know them. There's no romance, no heart, no humor but the film makers carry on as if there were. When Ms. Lane finally kisses Superman, it's completely flat and lifeless. This film is also illogical in the sense that they sent Zod to the phantom zone KNOWING THAT THE PLANET WOULD BE DESTROYED, whereas in the 1979 film they were sent to the phantom zone before the knowledge that the planet was going to be destroyed was revealed to the council. That was logical, here even my Mom said that was stupid. Also seeing Superman be so reckless just felt wrong. i love action but when he plunges Zod into the gas station and the K Mart, I thought to myself, ""He probably just killed about 20 people right there."" I always thought superman thought of the people that might be hurt in his surroundings but here it's like he's on meth and on a beserker rage.  How do you take your superheroes? I prefer mine light and sweet, but these days they mostly come dark and bitter. In the wake of Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy, Spider-Man has gone all angsty, Iron Man suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and now we have a brooding ""Man of Steel.""Look, up in the sky! It's a guy struggling with inner conflict! By casting Superman as a literal and metaphorical alien, ""Man of Steel"" aims to update a beloved but creaky icon for a problematic, post-9/11 world. It's written by David S. Goyer, who collaborated on Nolan's three ""Batman"" films, but this time the dark shadings feel like a fashionable Hollywood pose.A reworking of the 1978 and 1980 ""Superman"" movies, ""Man of Steel"" can be entertaining and hits some satisfying notes. Brit Henry Cavill, chiseled and soulful, replaces the cherubic Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent, now a scruffy drifter hiding his superpowers. Clark (called ""Superman"" only twice) keeps rescuing folks and moving on, like Bruce Banner hiding his Hulk-ness. It's slow going, but director Zack Snyder handles the material sensitively. Clark's adoptive parents are played by Diane Lane and a genuinely moving Kevin Costner.Reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams), whose Daily Planet is now edited by Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, has grit and swagger but disappointingly little gift for banter. She mostly regards Clark as a source. ""It's all downhill after the first kiss,"" she says, a dry wisecrack that turns out to be too true.Superman's new costume has trendy new textures (and no red briefs!), but the biggest suit to fill may belong to the ruthless General Zod, first immortalized by Terence Stamp and here played by Michael Shannon (""Revolutionary Road""). Zod has now-obligatory whiffs of terrorism, but Shannon, an actor of almost supernatural intensity, plays him with a rage and empathy worthy of Shakespeare's Richard III. When he's on screen, ""Man of Steel"" earns its air of gravitas.Mostly, though, the movie panders. Krypton is needlessly refashioned into Middle Earth, with dragons and wizards (Russell Crowe pontificates as Superman's all-knowing father, Jor-El), while Metropolis is decimated in a long sequence that's part Twin Towers re-enactment, part special-effects bonanza. ""Man of Steel"" may successfully resuscitate our most cherished superhero, but now he just looks like all the other guys in tights.The only thing this film succeeds at are three things: Making the 1979 film seem even more like a Masterpiece, making Superman 2: The Richard Donner Cut even more revered and adored, and making Superman Returns not seem so bad...i'm even grateful for the film now and retract all my complaints after seeing this drivel...",1,"This is NOT Superman, it's SOULLESS MAN!

My problem is that Man of Steel is a TERRIBLE movie that, for some inscrutable reason, people seem to think was good. Goyer seems to have forgotten the rule in writing &#34;show, don't tell.&#34; This movie is full of subplots that go nowhere, flashbacks that serve no narrative purpose, good actors going completely to waste, and action set pieces that drag on for so long that the action actually becomes boring. The cast is amazing, but the actors have nothing to work with because there is nothing resembling actual characters in this movie. People just go through the motions that we're supposed to expect from Superman-related characters, but none of it feels genuine or earned, and there is no character development of any kind, no actual arc at all. The entire second half of the film is one long action sequence that is so repetitive that I was begging for it to be over. I love myself some gratuitous explosions, don't get me wrong, but there is so little variation in the action, and the action does little to nothing in the way of advancing the story, that it became tedious. The audience should never be bored when godlike superbeings are duking it out with the fate of the world in the balance, but I was. The movie is not without some good features. As I said, the cast is excellent; visually, it's very pretty; the music is fine, if a bit forgettable (not as iconic as John Williams's Superman theme, or Danny Elfman's Batman, or Hans Zimmer's earlier work on the Dark Knight trilogy). Where this movie failed was in the writing. I've come to expect much better from David S. Goyer. This is some of his worst work, worse than The Crow 2, worse than the David Hasselhoff Nick Fury movie. I guess I should have had lower expectations because of Zack Snyder, because this movie is consistent with his level of work. It was worse than Watchmen, but not as bad as Suckerpunch.

So, there was definitely a considerable audience for Man Of Steel, one that was longing for a proper Superman movie. At the same time, though, with all the superhero franchises out there that have already been successful, and already have satisfied many needs for great comic book adaptions, you really have to knock one out of the park to be considered in the same league as Batman, Spider-Man, Iron Man or The Avengers.

With Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder, whose Watchmen was a good piece of film making, one would think the right people were in place.So, does it hold up? In a word, no.If you want to save yourself the hassle of reading this lengthy review to its bitter end, let me sum it up for you quickly: Man Of Steel is the result of taking Superman The Movie and Superman 2, making the lead actor seem uncharismatic, removing the sense for delight and adventure, replacing the poignant dialogue with pseudo-drama, and unleashing ridiculously long Transformers-like CGI action sequences upon the unsuspecting audience.Condensing this down even further, I would pick three words to describe this film: stupid, tedious and superficial. ""Stupid"" sounds, well, stupid, but is in its simplicity a great word to describe the intangible feeling hanging over this entire thing.The prologue already alienated me from the entire Superman universe. It looks like a combo of a George Lucas directed Star Wars prequel and Transformers, complete with silly flying pteranodons. In the council scenes, I almost expected Yoda to come forth and say ""Evacuate Krypton, we will not!"" Had this prologue not key scenes of the Superman mythology, you would surely mistake it for a second-grade sci-fi flick.The CGI mumbo-jumbo goes completely over board here (and later on), and showcases perfectly the difference between well-designed thought through sets, and the misleading notion ""more and bigger is better"". It is quite the achievement on part of the design team to make a 2013 movie look more ridiculous than Superman The Movie from 30 years ago. I usually don't nitpick on things like this, but when Zod and his accomplices were taken into the Phantom Zone in what looked exactly like big black rubber penises, I sunk just a tiny bit lower in my seat.The story is nothing revolutionary, but I lost complete faith in the credibility of the film when it was revealed that Jor-El hid the DNA of every single Kryptonian in Superman's cells. That's when I knew someone on this project had to have lost his mind.There was some doubt and fear that Christopher Nolan's involvement could mean a Dark Knight treatment for a character that is, and should be, arguably almost the polar opposite of Batman in tone. And gues what? These fears were justified. No movie to this day managed to suck the life and heart out of a superhero as thoroughly as Man Of Steel.What makes this movie so absolutely tiresome is two things: the story, which is atrociously told, and the action sequences that are overlong and tedious in their visual and sonic overkill.You have here the origin story of Superman, which has already been told twice before. You would think that, as a film maker, you want to really make it work, you want to make it exciting and fresh, with good dialogue and so on. Instead, what we have here is a Clark Kent/Superman that could as well be Bruce Wayne, or Peter Parker, with all the incessant self-doubts and thoughtful and sorrowful looks. It is truly annoying and frustrating, not to mention overdone, that producers/directors of superhero flicks apparently think lots of superficial drama and a hero with self-doubts and worried eyes can replace a well-written story and well-portrayed and fleshed out characters.If these inner conflicts were at least portrayed well and believable, but they are not. It works on a very basic level, but everything beyond appears to be just pure superficial drama. And this is simply due to the fact that Superman/Clark Kent is not, and never was, such a deeply troubled individual such as Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker. The whole world knows it, and you simply don't buy it.Ironically, when the writer/director does have the opportunity to create something worthwhile and heartfelt, it feels half-assed and rushed, like the exposition of his space capsule to young Clark.Looking at Man Of Steel, it doesn't get any more superficial, especially in the last hour of the movie, where basically nothing happens except loads of explosions and CGI wizardry. There is no sense of heroism in this film, no sense of adventure or romance, just superficial drama and mind-numbing action sequences. If you want to know how bad it is, let me just say that the film makers managed to suck the life out of the characters and the story to such an extent that the first kiss between Superman and Lois Lane, probably one of the most iconic love couples in cinema, feels wierd and out of place. Speaking of Lois Lane, Amy Adams does her best, but falls victim to the overused marketing ploy of squeezing a female character into the story, or in this case taking an existing character and blowing it out of proportions, in order to capture female demographics. Not to mention that the decision to make her meet Clark and his superpowers early on is one of the worse decisions in this film.Indeed, one could rightfully say that out of all the major superhero films in the last 10 years, Man Of Steel is the one that comes closest to compromising the entire heart and soul of its title character. Superman Returns was way more enjoyable than Man Of Steel, on many levels.Just as an example, Superman Returns had a focus, and you knew what the film makers were trying to do, and they did it, no matter how clumsily you think they did it. But in Man Of Steel, there is literally not a single thing the movie focuses on for a prolonged time except that Zod wants to turn earth into Krypton. There is a lot of jammering about finding your place, finding yourself, finding destiny, but there is no effort done by the writers or the director to show me, the audience, how the main character develops. That feeling of development is never there, so I stopped caring halfway through.It also doesn't help the entertainment value of the film that the producers decided to turn this into an alien invasion movie, when alien invasion movies seem to reproduce themselves like rabbits these days.The picture also has enormous pacing problems. From the very first scenes on, you get the impression nobody did a test screening, not even for the director.Man Of Steel is in its first half extremely slow and tedious because of the uninteresting dialogues and bad chracterisations, to the point were the ongoing flashbacks stop the movie dead in its tracks, and in its second half, it is just mind-numbing in its over the top action, which almost reaches Transformers' level of absurdity, albeit thankfully without the pre-school humour. Speaking of humour, it doesn't exist in this film. I don't know, maybe Snyder and Nolan talk about their own director's cut when they speak of the fun aspects of this film, but the cut that was shown at my theatre didn't have any of that. Instead, everything is teinted with this aforementioned, theatrical drama, which puts an enormous distance between the film and the audience.To make clear how bad this movie needs some light moments and good-natured dialogue, the only time I genuinely smiled in this movie was at the very end, when a young female soldier made a remark about Superman being hot. Can you imagine how dry this film is sucked from everything fun when the only laugh it gets comes from an unoriginal sex joke?A major factor in this exhausting film experience that is Man Of Steel is one trick p(h)ony Hans Zimmer, who is so subtle in his approach that he hammers away huge minor harmonies every 3 minutes, to signify this is most epic thing we have seen since, well, since three minutes ago. His music not only severely lacks understanding for the subject, it also lacks the ability to feel, embrace or enhance cinematic pace, or indeed on screen action, and fails to infuse the movie with anything except horribly overbearing melodrama, stone old synth sounds and repeating drum loops around every corner. While this is certainly true of many of Zimmer's scores, I feel with Man Of Steel, he has reached the absolute peak. In my wildest nightmares I didn't imagine Superman flying to hammy ""High Noon at Daisy Town"" guitar figures and fake sounding drum loops. If you look at scenes like Kal-El's capsule flying to earth or his first appearance in his suit, and imagine Williams' music, you should break out in tears.The score wanders through Zimmer's opus like a ""Best of 2000s"" album: from DaVinci Code over Dark Knight all the way to ""Mermaids"" from Pirates 4, all quoted near verbatim.This is lazily conceived, badly spotted, worse orchestrated, mind-numbingly mixed wallpaper that also happens to be laughably simplistic in composition and absolutely interchangable in style. I won't even begin to discuss the lack of anything remotely resembling heroism, which is inherent in the Superman character, no matter how hard Snyder and Nolan try to remove it.Man Of Steel has some of the worst mismatches between picture and music I have ever seen. And you don't have to compare it to John Williams to realise this.Man of Steel, all together, is creepily reminiscent of Matrix Revolutions. A saviour is forced to accept his role and deal with his powers in a different world, a lot of pseudo-deep stuff is thrown in seemingly randomly and doesn't come together in the end, there are silly, gigantic robots fighting in overlong sequences, the female protagonist tries to destroy the hero's doubts and drives him forward, and at the end, the two main antagonists have a cartoony fight between rooftops - two gods pitched against each other. You even have Laurence Fishburn in a wise-cracking role and Harry Lennix in the exact same role as the iron balls, asshole commander. To be fair though, Matrix Revolutions had good music.The acting is thoroughly competent, even though it is terribly sad to watch so much talent being wasted in such a mundane movie. It is especially bad for Henry Cavill, who makes for a great Superman, or would make for a great one were he not asked to constantly act like he forgot to take his anti-depression medication, and forced to wear a dull costume better suited for Bizarro than Superman.The biggest sin of all however is that Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder failed to make Man Of Steel unique and recognisable. It is a copy of The Dark Knight and Spider-Man at the best, and just another noisy sci-fi flick at the worst of times. I want to watch this film again as much as I want to hear the soundtrack album for a second time.As much as I love Superman, this movie barely makes it to the 2 out of 5 stars mark.",2,Superman Rises

It is an epic in the highest sense in that regard with actors who were made to play the parts and a magnificent soundtrack that conveys the urgency of the combat between good and consummate evil with a portrayal of a humble Superman who proved beyond a shadow of a doubt the ""He who humbles himself shall be exalted"".  The spiritual parallels are unmistakable with the most glaring being the sub-commander of General Zod telling Superman that he was too weak because he had morals, and that she would overcome because she had none with evolution always winning out in the end, which it didn't in this movie mirroring real life.

They dropped Brandon Routh into the roll in &#34;Superman Returns&#34;, 2006, trying to ignore that he wasn't the same actor from the 4 previous movies, and although I thought he actually did a fairly decent job, he was disregarded.  The revamp gives you the feel that the roll is this actor now, however right or wrong. Plus, Henry Cavill, yummy!!!  But I digress ;) ........BE SHARP HERE FOLKS , THE FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.....I TRY NOT TO GIVE MUCH AWAY, BUT......... The movie starts us back on Krypton (which for some reason made me think  of  Star Trek's planet of Vulcan, not sure why), where we see his birth to Jor-El and Lara and learn the significance of this.  It flows into his travels to find himself, interspersed with flashbacks of his days with his Earth parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, and his struggles to fit in with humans as his powers emerge.  This movie is not played for camp.  It takes us on this journey as with real life, humor where it may be found, but no over the top comedic villains here.

The cast is very fine &#8211; hunky Henry Cavill is a rather demure Superman and that is in his favor, Amy Adams makes Lois Lane credible, Michael Shannon is ominous as the evil General Zod, and then there are the home-baked goodness of Diane Lane and Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe and Amtje Traue as the variable parents (Krypton genes, Kansas adoption). Nods also go to Christopher Meloni, Ayelet Zurer, Harry Lennix, Richard Schiff, and Laurence Fishburne for trying to take all this seriously.Plot (not really adapted from the original comic books):  A child, sent to Earth from a dying planet, is adopted by a couple in rural Kansas. As a young boy he learns that he has extraordinary powers and is not of this Earth. As a young man, he journeys to discover where he came from and what he was sent here to do. But the hero in him must emerge if he is to save the world from annihilation and become the symbol of hope for all mankind.Sounds like a good story through the sci-fi telescope.

1561552,A1ULOEMZ3FA0C6,B008JFUPFI,Greg,"[5, 14]","During The Great Depression two young adult's imagined a hero that would allow them to forget the sorrows of the time.  In 1938 Superman was published by Action Comics and has adapted over the next seventy five years.  The character has become one of the most recognizable characters to date.  The character has had several iterations in book and movie form; including a movie which helped propel this American culture icon to new heights in 1978.  This particular adaptation didn't follow a comic, it bent the archetype to the movie.  Which worked well, Christopher Reeve has become so engrained as this icon that in 2006 Brian Singer's remake Superman Returns became a train wreck.You are probably thinking ""Why am I getting a history lesson on Superman?""The reason is simple, many people are only familiar with the adaptation from Richard Donner.  Man Of Steel sought to not only reinvigorate the character but the entire franchise.  Similar to the approach in comics.  They've molded the character into a very real, compassionate character, that is loved by millions.  However, this character has a distinct principal that violates all other characters- he will always be a strong and fast as he needs to be.  Which means this character by nature will always be considered the most powerful character.All of this information is important is it muddled several viewers; it became a ""you like it"" or ""you don't like it.""  Which from history doesn't bode well with the audience.  The reason this has become evident is because Man Of Steel tries to take too much and pack it into the film.  An example would be Batman Begins, it created a drama which engrossed viewers in a powerful manner. Unfortunately this didn't bode well for a large amount of audience people who wanted to truly see Superman's power with some originality.  The Amazing Spiderman or Superman the movie, they sought to focus on the relate able nature of the character. The Avengers who was an action spectacle, with earths mightiest heroes created havoc in New York City from an alien invasion.By themselves they are all strong movies as they committed to a style.  Man Of Steel deviated drastically from that approach, it tried to encompass it all.  This had merit and value, which made the movie quite good but not great.  The methodology for telling Kal-El's origin was done uniquely and quickly, which had a very strong flow earlier in the movie.  Some of the modification to the story made it quite odd, especially with Johnathan and Martha Kent.  They are ultimately the ones whom instill the morality of right and wrong for a Godly being.  This lacked severe depth, which ultimately makes the climactic shock at the end extremely difficult to relate or empathize.The next hurdle was a balance of story and action; clearly Zack Snyder chose the Godly aspect. Really focusing on how young and immature Kal-El is in the usage of his powers; they continually wanted to show how he tried to figure out how to beat the villain.  Also they wanted to show how a structure wasn't able to stand against his presence.  Though this was a nice touch, it became excessive.They also really wanted you to relate to the character as an outcast, which did move and capture this nature.  Unfortunately by poor editing or a lack of foresight the movie felt choppy especially for a movie at two hours and thirty five minutes.  Almost like they didn't want too much of one style, but more of a balance between the three.  So it made a potentially great movie and made it okay.Each time I watched it I captured more elements, but it was quickly followed by an imaginative thought about the direction.  Mostly because they chose to be vague rather specific; which made the plot quite opaque when viewing.  You continually created assumptions rather then concrete evidence.  When viewing it and dissecting each aspect it becomes a more full movie, but as a whole it becomes hard to rate it.  Mostly because it tries too hard to be everything.I would highly recommend the movie, it was enjoyable.  They imagined Superman differently, they did it well but still could be better.  If you are expecting Man Of Steel to be campy, you're mistaken.  It is a darker more serious approach, as I mentioned above is due to them trying to encompass two additional movie elements to the stories tone.  I wouldn't rule the movie out, but go in with an open mind and you might enjoy it.Hopefully this helps.",5,An Accurate Portrayl,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,4445,"['Great', 'Depression', 'two', 'young', 'adult', 'imagined', 'hero', 'would', 'allow', 'forget', 'sorrows', 'time', '1938', 'Superman', 'was', 'published', 'Action', 'Comics', 'adapted', 'next', 'seventy', 'five', 'years', 'character', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'recognizable', 'characters', 'date', 'character', 'had', 'several', 'iterations', 'book', 'movie', 'form', 'including', 'movie', 'helped', 'propel', 'American', 'culture', 'icon', 'new', 'heights', '1978', 'particular', 'adaptation', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'comic', 'bent', 'archetype', 'movie', 'Which', 'worked', 'well', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'become', 'so', 'engrained', 'icon', '2006', 'Brian', 'Singer', 'remake', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'became', 'train', 'wreck.You', 'are', 'probably', 'thinking', 'Why', 'am', 'getting', 'history', 'lesson', 'Superman', 'reason', 'simple', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'only', 'familiar', 'adaptation', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Man', 'Steel', 'sought', 'not', 'only', 'reinvigorate', 'character', 'entire', 'franchise', 'Similar', 'approach', 'comics', ""'ve"", 'molded', 'character', 'very', 'real', 'compassionate', 'character', 'loved', 'millions', 'However', 'character', 'distinct', 'principal', 'other', 'characters-', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'strong', 'fast', 'be', 'Which', 'character', 'nature', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'considered', 'most', 'powerful', 'character.All', 'information', 'important', 'muddled', 'several', 'viewers', 'became', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'history', ""n't"", 'bode', 'well', 'audience', 'reason', 'become', 'evident', 'Man', 'Steel', 'tries', 'take', 'too', 'much', 'pack', 'film', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'created', 'drama', 'engrossed', 'viewers', 'powerful', 'manner', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'bode', 'well', 'large', 'amount', 'audience', 'people', 'who', 'wanted', 'truly', 'see', 'Superman', 'power', 'originality', 'Amazing', 'Spiderman', 'Superman', 'movie', 'sought', 'focus', 'relate', 'able', 'nature', 'character', 'Avengers', 'who', 'was', 'action', 'spectacle', 'earths', 'mightiest', 'heroes', 'created', 'havoc', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'alien', 'invasion.By', 'are', 'strong', 'movies', 'committed', 'style', 'Man', 'Steel', 'deviated', 'drastically', 'approach', 'tried', 'encompass', 'had', 'merit', 'value', 'made', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'methodology', 'telling', 'Kal-El', 'origin', 'was', 'done', 'uniquely', 'quickly', 'had', 'very', 'strong', 'flow', 'earlier', 'movie', 'modification', 'story', 'made', 'quite', 'odd', 'especially', 'Johnathan', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'are', 'ultimately', 'ones', 'whom', 'instill', 'morality', 'right', 'wrong', 'Godly', 'being', 'lacked', 'severe', 'depth', 'ultimately', 'climactic', 'shock', 'end', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'relate', 'empathize.The', 'next', 'hurdle', 'was', 'balance', 'story', 'action', 'clearly', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'chose', 'Godly', 'aspect', 'Really', 'focusing', 'how', 'young', 'immature', 'Kal-El', 'usage', 'powers', 'continually', 'wanted', 'show', 'how', 'tried', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'beat', 'villain', 'Also', 'wanted', 'show', 'how', 'structure', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'stand', 'presence', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'became', 'excessive.They', 'also', 'really', 'wanted', 'relate', 'character', 'outcast', 'did', 'move', 'capture', 'nature', 'Unfortunately', 'poor', 'editing', 'lack', 'foresight', 'movie', 'felt', 'choppy', 'especially', 'movie', 'two', 'hours', 'thirty', 'five', 'minutes', 'Almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'style', 'more', 'balance', 'three', 'made', 'potentially', 'great', 'movie', 'made', 'okay.Each', 'time', 'watched', 'captured', 'more', 'elements', 'was', 'quickly', 'followed', 'imaginative', 'thought', 'direction', 'Mostly', 'chose', 'be', 'vague', 'rather', 'specific', 'made', 'plot', 'quite', 'opaque', 'when', 'viewing', 'continually', 'created', 'assumptions', 'rather', 'then', 'concrete', 'evidence', 'When', 'viewing', 'dissecting', 'aspect', 'more', 'full', 'movie', 'whole', 'hard', 'rate', 'Mostly', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'everything.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'imagined', 'Superman', 'differently', 'did', 'well', 'still', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'are', 'expecting', 'Man', 'Steel', 'be', 'campy', ""'re"", 'mistaken', 'darker', 'more', 'serious', 'approach', 'mentioned', 'above', 'due', 'trying', 'encompass', 'two', 'additional', 'movie', 'elements', 'stories', 'tone', 'would', ""n't"", 'rule', 'movie', 'out', 'go', 'open', 'mind', 'might', 'enjoy', 'it.Hopefully']",N/A

The answer is, yes, of course. But it's not the fault of the movie - it's always been that way. Alien sent to earth by father, takes on the nature of a human being, but he's still much more than that, etc. etc. ... that's part of the Superman mythos. Sure, there's the cross-pose in space, and he ""descends into Hades"", and so on, in this movie. But just because it retells themes of The Greatest Story, doesn't mean it can't be fun. And, generally, it is.On the flip side, it also exposes the dark side of Darwinism - the conclusion that the strong should rule the weak. That's exactly what Hitler based his holocaust upon, and the historical records show it. Hitler sought to exterminate the Church because the Nazis considered her care for the weak ""effete"" and ""anti-evolutionistic"". Darwin himself lamented that ""We civilized men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. ... Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man."" This is a sentiment echoed aloud by the bad guys here.Well, I think they erred on making Clark so buffed. It takes away from his ""ordinariness"" on the human side. But the other parts and ideas of the reboot are interesting. His weakness is no longer Kryptonite, for example, but something that makes a bit more sense. Couldn't explain the flying, but then again, no one can.Interesting questions are posed. Should he let a bus of kids drown? His dad gives us an answer that makes us uneasy. Krypton has abandoned ""natural"" birth, opting for programmed traits a al ""Brave New World"" where everyone's job is determined. This is contrasted to our own vision of individual choice. Zod's anguish at the end when his life-purpose is destroyed is also disquieting. And raises questions regarding what it means to be human and the nature of idolatry - centering your life around something that will, in the end, betray you.This film is epic in the way ""Thor"" should have been, instead of being played out in some dinky town. But in the last part of the movie, there were WAAAAAAY too many explosions and general destruction. I understand why they did it - it had to be a big battle - but after a while it just became numbing (boom boom boom crash etc.). And the final act with Zod was strangely muted.There are great visuals and effects, and Jor-El is much more prominent here, in a welcome way. The Krypton tech seems a bit klunky to us viewers used to looking at colorful displays, but that's aliens for you.The logic of the hapless Krypton council also seems hokey. Surely they could have seen their destruction coming and escaped. And surely some of their outposts could have begun supporting themselves. But that's the setup. Just go with it.Some critics complained that Lois and Clark didn't click. It didn't seem that way to me.The last line was pretty good.All in all, enjoyable and spectacular, but for the mind-numbing destruction marathon, which could have been 20 minutes shorter. 3.5 stars would be more accurate.",4,"Great, but a bit too loud",1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,3409,"['So', 'let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'Insert', 'knee-jerk', 'not', 'helpful', 'vote', 'here', 'Superman', 'Christ-figure', 'answer', 'yes', 'course', 'not', 'fault', 'movie', 'always', 'been', 'way', 'Alien', 'sent', 'earth', 'father', 'nature', 'human', 'being', 'still', 'much', 'more', 'etc', 'etc', 'part', 'Superman', 'mythos', 'Sure', 'cross-pose', 'space', 'Hades', 'so', 'movie', 'just', 'themes', 'Greatest', 'Story', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'fun', 'generally', 'flip', 'side', 'also', 'dark', 'side', 'Darwinism', 'conclusion', 'strong', 'should', 'rule', 'weak', 'exactly', 'what', 'Hitler', 'based', 'holocaust', 'upon', 'historical', 'records', 'show', 'Hitler', 'sought', 'exterminate', 'Church', 'Nazis', 'considered', 'care', 'weak', 'effete', 'anti-evolutionistic', 'Darwin', 'lamented', 'civilized', 'men', 'other', 'hand', 'do', 'utmost', 'check', 'process', 'elimination', 'build', 'asylums', 'imbecile', 'maimed', 'sick', 'institute', 'poor-laws', 'medical', 'men', 'exert', 'utmost', 'skill', 'save', 'life', 'one', 'last', 'moment', 'Thus', 'weak', 'members', 'civilized', 'societies', 'propagate', 'kind', 'one', 'who', 'attended', 'breeding', 'domestic', 'animals', 'will', 'doubt', 'must', 'be', 'highly', 'injurious', 'race', 'man', 'sentiment', 'echoed', 'aloud', 'bad', 'guys', 'here.Well', 'think', 'erred', 'making', 'Clark', 'so', 'buffed', 'away', 'ordinariness', 'human', 'side', 'other', 'parts', 'ideas', 'reboot', 'are', 'interesting', 'weakness', 'longer', 'Kryptonite', 'example', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'sense', 'Could', ""n't"", 'explain', 'flying', 'then', 'again', 'one', 'can.Interesting', 'questions', 'are', 'posed', 'Should', 'let', 'bus', 'kids', 'drown', 'dad', 'answer', 'uneasy', 'Krypton', 'abandoned', 'natural', 'birth', 'opting', 'programmed', 'traits', 'al', 'Brave', 'New', 'World', 'where', 'everyone', 'job', 'determined', 'contrasted', 'own', 'vision', 'individual', 'choice', 'Zod', 'anguish', 'end', 'when', 'life-purpose', 'destroyed', 'also', 'disquieting', 'questions', 'regarding', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'nature', 'idolatry', 'centering', 'life', 'something', 'will', 'end', 'betray', 'you.This', 'film', 'epic', 'way', 'Thor', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'instead', 'being', 'played', 'out', 'dinky', 'town', 'last', 'part', 'movie', 'were', 'WAAAAAAY', 'too', 'many', 'explosions', 'general', 'destruction', 'understand', 'why', 'did', 'had', 'be', 'big', 'battle', 'while', 'just', 'became', 'numbing', 'boom', 'boom', 'boom', 'crash', 'etc.', 'final', 'act', 'Zod', 'was', 'strangely', 'muted.There', 'are', 'great', 'visuals', 'effects', 'Jor-El', 'much', 'more', 'prominent', 'here', 'welcome', 'way', 'Krypton', 'tech', 'bit', 'klunky', 'viewers', 'used', 'looking', 'colorful', 'displays', 'aliens', 'you.The', 'logic', 'hapless', 'Krypton', 'council', 'also', 'hokey', 'Surely', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'destruction', 'coming', 'escaped', 'surely', 'outposts', 'could', 'have', 'begun', 'supporting', 'setup', 'Just', 'go', 'it.Some', 'critics', 'complained', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'did', ""n't"", 'click', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'way', 'me.The', 'last', 'line', 'was', 'pretty', 'good.All', 'enjoyable', 'spectacular', 'mind-numbing', 'destruction', 'marathon', 'could', 'have', 'been', '20', 'minutes', 'shorter', '3.5', 'stars', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate']",N/A

1561561,A3OHB78Y7L7ZK,B008JFUPFI,GSD,"[5, 11]","Man of Steel is to Superman as Batman Begins is to Batman; It brings back a popular comics character to the big screen in a fresh way. While Man of Steel is not quite as triumphant a success as Batman Begins was, it is the best Superman film since the 1978 masterpiece. It has a bit in common with Batman Begins, like the realistic approach, but the alien world aspect makes this film feel more like a sci-fi/fantasy adventure than a conventional comic book movie.Man of Steel`s narrative structure is similar to Batman Begins. This is not surprising considering it has the same screenwriter David S. Goyer and the Batman trilogy's director Christopher Nolan acts as a producer.The first fifteen minutes or so are the most entertaining part of the film. The movie treads in full sci-fi fantasy territory, on the dying world of Krypton, where, as is familiar to any Superman fan, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) places his infant son Kal-El into a tiny spacecraft and sends him across the stars to our planet. Meanwhile, Krypton's military leader General Zod (Michael Shannon) attempts a coup, but is caught and tossed with his followers into The Phantom Zone. The dying planet is visually impressive and the previously mostly unexplored territory makes things feel fresher and less generic.After the epic Krypton sequence, the film starts with Clark as an adult and then periodically uses a series of flashbacks sketching out his past. The first half or so deals mainly with Clark's background: his birth, his childhood with the Kents, his feats of strength, he and Lois crossing paths, Clark finding his father's hologram and learning the full potential of his powers.Things get far darker than any Superman film ever has been about half way through this movie when Zod shows up with his minions on Earth. This is where the movie turns into a colossal action extravaganza, serving up both epic spectacle and lots of bombastic superhero action, which is something Superman fans have been starved for on the screen.Needless to say, Superman defeats Zod but at the great cost of probably a billion dollars in property destruction and a great loss of life, which may seem a bit too un-Superman-ish. Is this the right tone befitting the character of Superman? Maybe. Maybe not. There may be something a little iffy about a movie centering around one of the most unfailingly noble, pure-hearted superheroes reveling so much in Transformers-level carnage. The Man of Steel of the golden age comics was brutish and took no prisoners, so for this Superman fan, it works. The ending sequence gives us Clark Kent, mild mannered reporterThe visual effects are first-rate, and the action scenes, which are frequent and lengthy, have a quick pace. Sharp-eyed viewers will appreciate some Easter eggs as well (most prominently the LexCorps logo). Goyer also dispenses with at least one hackneyed plot point from most previous films by having Lois discover early on that Clark Kent and Superman are one and the same (though the ending suggests the glasses that magically render him unrecognizable might still have their effect on everyone else).All in all, Man of Steel is far from a perfect motion picture, but it's highly-enjoyable summer blockbuster entertainment, serving up epic spectacle that should entertain most moviegoers, albeit at the cost of sacrificing some heart along the way. Faults aside, I never found the movie boring, but it is not as pure as the 1978 film.",4,A Worthwile Treatment For An American Icon!,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,3454,"['Man', 'Steel', 'Superman', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Batman', 'back', 'popular', 'comics', 'character', 'big', 'screen', 'fresh', 'way', 'Man', 'Steel', 'not', 'quite', 'triumphant', 'success', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'was', 'best', 'Superman', 'film', '1978', 'masterpiece', 'bit', 'common', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'realistic', 'approach', 'alien', 'world', 'aspect', 'film', 'feel', 'more', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'adventure', 'conventional', 'comic', 'book', 'movie.Man', 'Steel', 's', 'narrative', 'structure', 'similar', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'not', 'surprising', 'considering', 'same', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'S.', 'Goyer', 'Batman', 'trilogy', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'producer.The', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'most', 'entertaining', 'part', 'film', 'movie', 'treads', 'full', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'territory', 'dying', 'world', 'Krypton', 'where', 'familiar', 'Superman', 'fan', 'Jor-El', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'infant', 'son', 'Kal-El', 'tiny', 'spacecraft', 'stars', 'planet', 'Meanwhile', 'Krypton', 'military', 'leader', 'General', 'Zod', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'coup', 'caught', 'tossed', 'followers', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'dying', 'planet', 'visually', 'impressive', 'previously', 'mostly', 'unexplored', 'territory', 'things', 'feel', 'fresher', 'less', 'generic.After', 'epic', 'Krypton', 'sequence', 'film', 'Clark', 'adult', 'then', 'periodically', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'sketching', 'out', 'past', 'first', 'half', 'so', 'deals', 'mainly', 'Clark', 'background', 'birth', 'childhood', 'Kents', 'feats', 'strength', 'Lois', 'crossing', 'paths', 'Clark', 'finding', 'father', 'hologram', 'learning', 'full', 'potential', 'powers.Things', 'get', 'far', 'darker', 'Superman', 'film', 'ever', 'been', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'when', 'Zod', 'up', 'minions', 'Earth', 'where', 'movie', 'colossal', 'action', 'extravaganza', 'serving', 'up', 'epic', 'spectacle', 'lots', 'bombastic', 'superhero', 'action', 'something', 'Superman', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'starved', 'screen.Needless', 'say', 'Superman', 'Zod', 'great', 'cost', 'probably', 'billion', 'dollars', 'property', 'destruction', 'great', 'loss', 'life', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'too', 'un-Superman-ish', 'right', 'tone', 'befitting', 'character', 'Superman', 'Maybe', 'Maybe', 'not', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'little', 'iffy', 'movie', 'centering', 'one', 'most', 'unfailingly', 'noble', 'pure-hearted', 'superheroes', 'reveling', 'so', 'much', 'Transformers-level', 'carnage', 'Man', 'Steel', 'golden', 'age', 'comics', 'was', 'brutish', 'took', 'prisoners', 'so', 'Superman', 'fan', 'ending', 'sequence', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'mild', 'mannered', 'reporterThe', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'first-rate', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'frequent', 'lengthy', 'have', 'quick', 'pace', 'Sharp-eyed', 'viewers', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'prominently', 'LexCorps', 'logo', 'Goyer', 'also', 'least', 'one', 'hackneyed', 'plot', 'point', 'most', 'previous', 'films', 'having', 'Lois', 'discover', 'early', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'are', 'one', 'same', 'ending', 'glasses', 'magically', 'render', 'unrecognizable', 'might', 'still', 'have', 'effect', 'everyone', 'else', '.All', 'Man', 'Steel', 'far', 'perfect', 'motion', 'picture', 'highly-enjoyable', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'entertainment', 'serving', 'up', 'epic', 'spectacle', 'should', 'entertain', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'albeit', 'cost', 'sacrificing', 'heart', 'way', 'Faults', 'aside', 'never', 'found', 'movie', 'boring', 'not', 'as', 'pure', '1978', 'film']",N/A

Now, the new Superman movie, Man of Steel, has been released to great fanfare. I dutifully saw it on opening weekend and was largely unimpressed.What I liked: Henry Cavill does an excellent job portraying Kal-El, giving a slightly more brooding turn than usual. Some purists will object to a Briton portraying America's superhero, but as Superman is not even human, I'm fine with it. As for Clark Kent, we see very little of him - the famous glasses are not even worn until the last few frames of the movie. Amy Adams brings a knowing glint to Lois Lane, sadly missing from Kate Bosworth's limp portrayal in Superman Returns. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent in every respect, particularly Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent.  The non-linear plot construction was a nice touch, and a creative way to tell Superman's back story - which everyone should know by now.What I disliked: I didn't like the reimagined Krypton - give me the Donner icy galactic version any day. Nor did I care for the dumbed down plot and solution. In previous incarnations, from the comic books, to the serials, the classic 50s TV show and Christopher Reeve movies, Superman was always victorious in the end because he used his most important superpower: his brain. Here, we just have a series of endless action sequences ending in a snapped neck. The tuneless, percussive score droned monotonously. There's quite a bit of product placement in Man of Steel - but there was in the 1978 Superman movie as well. Cheerios and Timex watches have been replaced with IHOP and Sears.Best for a rental, this will not hold up to repeat viewing.",3,The magic is missing...,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,1755,"['SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'showing', 'age', 'First', 'newStar', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'Blu-ray', '+', 'DVD', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'movie', 'largely', 'left', 'cold', 'Now', 'new', 'Superman', 'movie', 'Man', 'Steel', 'been', 'released', 'great', 'fanfare', 'dutifully', 'saw', 'opening', 'weekend', 'was', 'largely', 'unimpressed.What', 'liked', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Kal-El', 'giving', 'slightly', 'more', 'brooding', 'turn', 'usual', 'purists', 'will', 'object', 'Briton', 'portraying', 'America', 'superhero', 'Superman', 'not', 'even', 'human', ""'m"", 'fine', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'famous', 'glasses', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'worn', 'last', 'few', 'frames', 'movie', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'knowing', 'glint', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'sadly', 'missing', 'Kate', 'Bosworth', 'limp', 'portrayal', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'rest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'respect', 'particularly', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'non-linear', 'plot', 'construction', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'creative', 'way', 'tell', 'Superman', 'back', 'story', 'everyone', 'should', 'know', 'disliked', 'did', ""n't"", 'reimagined', 'Krypton', 'give', 'Donner', 'icy', 'galactic', 'version', 'day', 'did', 'care', 'dumbed', 'plot', 'solution', 'previous', 'incarnations', 'comic', 'books', 'serials', 'classic', '50s', 'TV', 'show', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'movies', 'Superman', 'was', 'always', 'victorious', 'end', 'used', 'most', 'important', 'superpower', 'brain', 'Here', 'just', 'have', 'series', 'endless', 'action', 'sequences', 'ending', 'snapped', 'neck', 'tuneless', 'percussive', 'score', 'droned', 'monotonously', 'quite', 'bit', 'product', 'placement', 'Man', 'Steel', 'was', '1978', 'Superman', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Cheerios', 'Timex', 'watches', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'IHOP', 'Sears.Best', 'rental', 'will', 'not', 'hold', 'up', 'repeat', 'viewing']",N/A

1561574,A2SSWMJKNZLSPY,B008JFUPFI,hawkeye,"[3, 5]","If you liked Christopher Reeves, if you think Superman is a good and simple man, a man who always stands for simple old fashioned American ethics, if you think Superman is strong and unwavering in his righteousness, and these are the reasons you like the character, then please do not watch this movie. I'll warn you, you're going to get angry when you try to sit through this thing.This movie is just one more example of Hollywood's sickness: taking everything that was previously good (and I mean good in the altruistic way) and turning it into a contorted modern flawed ugly thing. They have destroyed so many of the nice and righteous parts of our culture by rewriting them or ""rebooting"" them. This is another sad example of how the soulless Hollywood machine can no longer express any goodness. Everything, even Superman is flawed, gray and unattractive. Nothing can be simply brave and true and simple anymore. They think that's progress. They don't see that it's actually digression. Sad.Superman over the last 76 years has stood as a fictional symbol of simplicity, goodness.... well, as he used to say: ""truth, justice and the American way."" Now we see the media machine pumping out a driveling, pathetic self pitying little floppy haired pouty boy as the ""Man of Steel"". It is interesting that as American itself doesn't any longer stand for truth and justice, neither does it's central comic book symbolic hero. The whole altruistic good vision is gone from the minds of our movie makers. They've lived too long in a gray shadowed existence in their all too real world of corporate compromise. Gone are the days of simple good male character finding their way onto the silver screen. And when they do come back they are changed beyond recognition. The saddest thing about this is that the younger generation will just eat this up and think that this Emo-Superdud is what this character is!Here's some annoyances you'll have to swallow if you decide to torture yourself with this movie:(1) Krypton is failing because of their environmentally unsound industrial practices. Oh my. How obvious can the brainwashing agenda be?!?! Can't they just make a movie anymore !?! Or does it all have to be some sort of message device, a soap box? When I pay to be entertained I am not paying to be preached at yet again about how terrible we are to the planet. Guilt guilt guilt. O.k., I feel crappy about using fossil fuels, now what? I can't just watch a Superman movie for an hour or two and then get back to the guilt after that? No. Can't we just watch a freakin' comic book movie and have a little fun? No. No you can't. Everything must be on message. Uh... such a waste. Inevitably all these dvd's need to be thrown in the dumpster.(2) Don't worry though... if you like being preached at they've got more for you. Old self-pitying Superbrat needs to save the off shore oil rig from itself in a big explosion scene. At least this stops his super-poutying teenage angst for a minute or two. But again, can these soulless Hollywood types think their own thoughts at all. No. They saw oil spills on the news and it was getting ratings and so they thought that was a good idea. Preachy and transparent. I really dislike movies that aren't really what they're supposed to be and are actually about getting bullet points or messages into the audience. Again, I thought I was buying a comic book movie.(3) This may seem small, but to the Superman fan it is not. It's a detail but I've always thought them smart to avoid. The scruff, the beard, shaving. In almost all Superman movies and tv, they avoid this issue, very wisely I think. What on the planet can he shave with. Bullets literally bounce off his pupils, so what does he shave with? Almost all other directors and producers cared just enough about the suspension of disbelief enough to avoid this issue. These filmmakers thought it more important to make him look cool or dramatic than to make the character make sense. Again, if you're not really a comic book person, sci-fi fan, or Superman buff, you might think this point silly, but it is not.(4) Krypton. Originally it simply died of old age. It was vague way back when. But it is clear that there was no rebellion or internal war. It is so pathetic that Hollywood has to take a place of enlightened higher level beings and lower them down, not only to our brutal human level, but to this very moment of war and brutality. No longer is Superman and his race a dream or ideal of an advanced species we might try to be like, no longer are we in awe of their peace and beauty. No, they are dumb and warlike like us. Great right! Don't you just identify with them so much more now that they cannot focus on the environmental issues tearing their planet apart because they're too busy killing each other. Isn't it great that they're just like us? These stupid filmmakers think people tune into Superman to see ourselves!!!!!No, Superman is supposed to be an ideal, not a reflection of our own inadequacies.(5) We can get into Zod and all the rewriting if you like, but let's just cut to the chase: they have no ideas in their manikin heads out there in Southern California. Everything is a pale rewrite of some previous material. They cannot simply pick Superman up where the last movie left off and writing from there. No, they have to retell the beginning because they have no original thoughts.All the media machine can do is regurgitate the same plots... each time releasing it with more bile left all over the product than the last time. So we have to use Superman II ideas. We have to retell the beginning of Superman I. And we have to puke it up through the ugly and contorted lens of our modern gray minds. They've forgotten what good looks like. They've forgotten how think, and apparently they don't seem to hire those people... what are they called.... oh, it's been so long since we've seen one... oh, yeah they're called writers. ""Re-writers"" seem to fit the bill just fine.Note to any Hollywood ""writers"" out there:If someone asks you to take an old idea that was good and touch it, rewrite it, or otherwise make it palatable for the modern audience, you should remember that you're a artist not an office secretary. Artists create, they do not destroy other people's creations and call themselves artists. No one calls themselves a painter when they've painted a new Mona Lisa. We call them forgers.I mean, this movie is an amalgam of pop culture hot words: terraforming, oil spill, coup d'&eacute;tat, military investigation, genetic engineering... blah, blah, etc. Tiring, obvious soap box big media messaging, wrapped in a flesh of a childish unmanly super-emo-man, who's self doubt and pity are pathetic.This is certainly not Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's Superman. You actually like that guy.Max Fleischer's Superman would not understand this movie at all. He lived in a different time, a simpller time, when good was obvious and Superman was a symbol of strength. Period.George Reeves' Superman was like your ideal, strong, caring, dad figure compared to this super-brat, who is like your wimpy, video game playing, pouty teenage emo son.And Finally, Christopher Reeves' likable, kind, simply, strong, bold, loving and brave Superman would simply shake his head and feel sorry for this pathetic little thing. Christopher as a human was immensely more charismatic, and as an actor was, well, a good actor ! You believed he was Superman. And finally, you liked him. And you like Superman. You wanted to be like him, and as a parent, you didn't mind your child wanting to be like him.I do not think Man of Steel is appropriate for small children the way almost all other Superman series were. I certainly don't want my son to be like this guy.I'd suggest passing on this movie. I wish I could give it zero stars.It's the worst Superman anything... ever.Finally, Superman does not kill. He is supposed to be a good person. Period. Therefore, this is not Superman.

1561575,A7EVXVUNYH7JC,B008JFUPFI,H. Baer,"[23, 50]","*Spoiler Alert*Though Man Of Steel had great production values, a handsome Superman (Henry Cavill), a brilliant Jor-El (Russell Crowe), and a competent cast overall, I found this to be a dark, militaristic version of the Superman tale. The film starts well, with Jor-El and Lara launching their infant son into space to avoid the destruction of Krypton. Russell Crowe was wonderful as always and looked awesome in his spandex (he must have worked out hard to achieve spandex perfection!). But I found other elements of the film less wonderful; for example, Kevin Costner was playing Kevin Costner, and I felt that though she was good, Diane Lane was miscast as Ma Kent. But I went along with the story changes and understood the desire of the director to take a different direction with the mythology, at least until the last 40 or so minutes when the movie degenerated into a repetitive and un-exciting battle between Kryptonians Superman and General Zod. It gets tiring watching super people throwing one another through buildings and destroying an entire city, especially when at the end of the fight, Superman simply wrings Zod's neck and kills him. Why didn't he do it 40 minutes earlier? (Okay, 38 minutes sooner) If Zod was going to die, why put us through so much overdone CGI? Also, in the original comics and previous incarnations of Superman, Superman NEVER killed anyone! Super villains were returned to the Phantom Zone, or wherever they came from. Crooks were sent to jail. Superman never ever would have wrung someone's neck. I found the gratuitous violence totally unnecessary and felt it denigrated the heroic qualities we look for in any re-telling of the Superman story.I would have given the movie 3 1/2 half stars if I had the option because there were many good elements, but I couldn't bring myself to give it 4 stars, so 3 it is. I know they'll do a sequel of some kind, and am not looking forward to it. For this re-boot, one was enough.Christopher Reeve's Superman was more fun, more true to the creators' vision, and suitable for kids to see. Reeve played 2 parts: the bumbling Clark Kent and the beautiful, charming Superman, contrasted with Cavill's single characterization of a Superman filled with angst and uncertainty, which for a guy who can fly and resist being killed by normal means, seemed a bit tough to believe. I suppose I'd recommend the movie if only to watch Crowe steal the show as he so often does.",3,A little disappointed,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,2444,"['*Spoiler', 'Alert*Though', 'Man', 'Steel', 'had', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'handsome', 'Superman', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'brilliant', 'Jor-El', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'competent', 'cast', 'overall', 'found', 'be', 'dark', 'militaristic', 'version', 'Superman', 'tale', 'film', 'well', 'Jor-El', 'Lara', 'launching', 'infant', 'son', 'space', 'avoid', 'destruction', 'Krypton', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'was', 'wonderful', 'always', 'looked', 'awesome', 'spandex', 'must', 'have', 'worked', 'out', 'hard', 'achieve', 'spandex', 'perfection', 'found', 'other', 'elements', 'film', 'wonderful', 'example', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'was', 'playing', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'felt', 'was', 'good', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'was', 'miscast', 'Ma', 'Kent', 'went', 'along', 'story', 'changes', 'understood', 'desire', 'director', 'take', 'different', 'direction', 'mythology', 'least', 'last', '40', 'so', 'minutes', 'when', 'movie', 'degenerated', 'repetitive', 'un-exciting', 'battle', 'Kryptonians', 'Superman', 'General', 'Zod', 'tiring', 'watching', 'super', 'people', 'throwing', 'one', 'buildings', 'destroying', 'entire', 'city', 'especially', 'when', 'end', 'fight', 'Superman', 'simply', 'Zod', 'neck', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', '40', 'minutes', 'earlier', 'Okay', '38', 'minutes', 'sooner', 'Zod', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'why', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'overdone', 'CGI', 'Also', 'original', 'comics', 'previous', 'incarnations', 'Superman', 'Superman', 'NEVER', 'killed', 'anyone', 'Super', 'villains', 'were', 'returned', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'came', 'Crooks', 'were', 'sent', 'jail', 'Superman', 'never', 'ever', 'would', 'have', 'wrung', 'someone', 'neck', 'found', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'felt', 'denigrated', 'heroic', 'look', 're-telling', 'Superman', 'story.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', '3', '1/2', 'half', 'stars', 'had', 'option', 'were', 'many', 'good', 'elements', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'so', '3', 'know', ""'ll"", 'do', 'sequel', 'kind', 'am', 'not', 'looking', 'forward', 're-boot', 'one', 'was', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'was', 'more', 'fun', 'more', 'true', 'creators', 'vision', 'suitable', 'kids', 'see', 'Reeve', 'played', '2', 'parts', 'bumbling', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'beautiful', 'charming', 'Superman', 'contrasted', 'Cavill', 'single', 'characterization', 'Superman', 'filled', 'angst', 'uncertainty', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'fly', 'resist', 'being', 'killed', 'normal', 'means', 'seemed', 'bit', 'tough', 'believe', 'suppose', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'only', 'watch', 'Crowe', 'steal', 'show', 'so', 'often']",N/A
1561576,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B008JFUPFI,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[7, 16]","Parties giddy with delight, parties up in arms. MAN OF STEEL's reaped enough box office duckets that they can for sure green light that Justice League movie. But MAN OF STEEL was always going to make money, even if it had sucked copious bat guana. If you loved the movie, I envy the he11 out of you. I wanted to love it. Instead, I'm ambivalent. I liked it okay, did not love it. I think Mark Waid's scathing review has merit. MAN OF STEEL falls short of my expectations. Mostly, it's the adaptation I'd dreaded Christopher Nolan and Zach Snyder would produce: overly somber and ponderous and absent of that twinkle in the eye with which Richard Donner's 1978 version has charmed generations.The narrative unfolds in non-linear fashion. It occasionally skips back to Clark's childhood past but not in sequential order. I was cool with that approach. If anything, I wish there'd been more flashback moments with young Clark and his parents. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are solid in fleshing out Ma and Pa Kent, with Diane Lane providing the film's emotional linchpin. Russell Crowe's take on Jor-El is the most kickasss incarnation of Clark's biological dad yet. I thought he was fantastic, before and after he died. I love Amy Adams so I won't discuss her Lois Lane. I did like that sequence in which she proves her mettle as a Pulitzer Prize reporter by back-tracking the trail of good deeds done by that mysterious good samaritan.Speaking of whom, Henry Cavill is tremendously buff and earnest and humorless as Clark Kent. It's weird but there were moments in which he resembled Tom Welling. I don't know how to feel about that. I thought, overall, Cavill does a fine job with what he's given to work with. It's almost as impressive as his dating Gina Carano.The sometimes iffy trajectory of plot and character shortchanges the film. Equally debilitating, Cavill and Adams have minimal chemistry. I guess I'm crying out for that classic Lois & Clark banter. A huge positive is Antje Traue who as Zod's Sub-Commander, Faora-Ul, is attractive in a ruthless, genocidal kind of way. On the field of battle, Faora impresses as someone even more lethal than Zod. The film showcases her application of super-speed much better than it does Superman's.It's a Nolan and Snyder joint, and we should've predicted the dark and incredibly serious tone. There are some good bits, even some great bits. It is visually stunning. For the most part, it's an exhilarating spectacle. But while the film focuses on the majesty of the Man of Steel, it's missing that sense of joy. One of the few times that the film really captures the spirit of Superman was during Clark's learning-how-to-fly sequence, which, by the way, trumps John Carter's learning-how-to-jump-really-high sequence. Clark's gleeful grin when he finally stabilizes himself in the air is pretty awesome. I anticipated more joyful scenes like that. There's a crap1oad of epic CG-generated action set pieces - and, yay, we should celebrate a big screen Superman who goes ba11s out in exhibiting his otherworldly skills set - but the final 40 minutes are so overwhelming and unrelenting that there eventually is this desensitizing effect.The ""You are not alone"" broadcast inspires a genuine frisson of disquiet. Sucks then that it's undermined by the sheer lack of suspense as to who's transmitting the message. For a film loaded with the actiony stuff, too much exposition goes down in which things are told to the viewer rather than shown. Paraphrasing a conversation between a scientist and some grunt who should've known better:- Scientist: ""They're terraforming!""- Grunt, on cue: ""What's that?""- Scientist: ""Well, terraforming is a process in which yada yada yada..."" (You get the picture.)Further stuff to ponder and also this ***SPOILER*** tag (you've been warned):- MAN OF STEEL is still miles ahead of SUPERMAN RETURNS. The one cool scene in SUPERMAN RETURNS? Bullet bouncing off the eyeball.- Jenny Olson spends a huge chunk of her screen time in need of rescuing, so thanks to whoever thought up the gender swapping for a long-established character. What was the point? Somewhere, Katee Sackhoff is laughing her a-- off.- It's baffling that Clark isn't stronger than these Kryptonians newly exposed to yellow sun. Clark had only been soaking up the sun's rays for, like, all his life.- What's up with Clark's finding his spiffy Superman suit on a ship that's supposedly been buried in ice for over 18,000 years?- When Clark steps into the suit, it doesn't feel like he'd earned it.- As a tornado descends on the highway and everyone flees, but the Kents' dog gets left behind in the car, it's ridiculous that it's Pa Kent who goes back to fetch the dog, instead of his son who, spoiler alert, is friggin' superhuman.- I don't buy Pa Kent's sacrifice. You can't convince me Clark was willing to just stand there and watch his dad die because the world isn't ready yet for what he is. Bu11crap!- In one flashback Pa Kent advises boy Clark that he was wrong to save the bus full of drowning children because it might have exposed him. WTF? Which leads to this next one...- Pa Kent needs to have a beer and a chat with Spider-Man's Uncle Ben.- What does it say when a film either plays it so coy or is so embarassed of its source material that it shies away from calling our guy ""Superman""?- For a hero who's supposed to be so concerned about saving lives, Superman seems awfully oblivious to all the folks in danger while he was punching and getting punched thru the cityscape. The casualties must've numbered in the hundreds of thousands, easy.- That was an awkward, unearned and uncomfortably extended kissing scene between Clark and Lois, given that in the backdrop you can see the smoking ruins of Metropolis and its people trying to pick themselves up.- I miss Teri Hatcher and Margot Kidder. And Dana Delaney.- Michael Shannon's Zod kneels before Terence Stamp's Zod.- And, yes, the most controversial element is Superman snapping General Zod's neck, thanks to Snyder and script doctor David S. Goyer's need to explain Superman's aversion to killing. Why must you explain why someone doesn't want to kill? Isn't it enough that he doesn't want to kill? I don't at all buy that Superman had no other recourse but to kill Zod. This act absolutely jettisons what he stands for. It redefines Superman. It lowers him to Wolverine's level. Superman's killed before in the comics, so it's not like it's unprecedented. But this just smacks of being incredibly contrived, with Snyder and Goyer intent on making their mark on the Superman mythos.- The Clark Kent (finally with glasses) that we see in the last two minutes or so is pretty great. This is the Clark Kent I was waiting for, warm and awkward and human and not vigorously waving that messianic flag.Okay, finally, (and, again, SPOILERS!!!!) here are a few things Clark could've done besides celery stalking Zod's neck:- Tell that endangered family to MOVE, dammit.- Cover Zod's eyes.- Distract Zod by telling him Terence Stamp is talking smack behind his back.- Using a raspy voice, whisper in Zod's ear: ""I'm the g0ddamned Batman!""- Ticklefest.",3,Zack Snyder tugs on Superman's cape,1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,7155,"['Parties', 'giddy', 'delight', 'parties', 'up', 'arms',

Although i'm not too bothered by the case of the missing iconic red pants giving director snyder reasons for not having them in this release so guess i'll let him have this one but that was it, that was the only good thing about this movie period.Now for the bad things wrong with this movie when a new film struggles to be a blockbuster you should already know by now that there's a problem and the problem was that this movie completely screwed up and basically pulled a ""smallville"" by changing everything and messing up some major superman canon, it was NOT the dc universe or for that matter have any true superman mythology implicated in this garbage flick. There is a reason that certain things are put in place and when that's out of the window all is lost, and why all of a sudden do they have to darken the colors of superman's cloth to fit this ""dark knight"" image persona superman after all he is a force for good and is the reason why he's clothes are bright and what also happened to ""truth and justice in the american way"". All through out the time when cavill becomes superman let's not forget they also have him do a lot of collateral damage when in actuality superman refrains from doing such things knowing people could get hurt which i recall is part of superman's fighting technique ""preserve life at all cost"". Superman i'm afraid is no longer an american hero and instead is trying to be turned into this anti cult hero like spawn, guyver, batman or even deathstroke and has been botched by the masses and the idiotic entertainment industry - R.I.P SupermanIn the end when it comes down to it, i wouldn't recommend this movie to any REAL superman fans especially those who have read the comics let alone those who know very little and would like to expand their knowledge on the character. To those who wanna learn more about superman i would recommend the first 2 ""alexander & illya salkind"" movies with christopher reeve or if you want to see a much more updated version of a superman movie then watch ""superman returns"" of 2006 it fared much better...even though that movie doesn't offer a whole lot it still is the latest movie that is canon to the superman mythology.",1,Man Of Steel: Movie That Needs To Be Killed,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,2724,"['Now', 'growing', 'up', 'popular', 'lesson', 'i', 'grew', 'up', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke', 'do', ""n't"", 'fix', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'wrong', 'movie', 'i', ""'ll"", 'start', 'good', 'thing', 're-imagining', 'remake', 'seem', 'have', 'finally', 'outdone', 'changing', 'look', 'S', 'i', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'previous', 'routh', 'S', '2006', 'also', 'added', 'few', 'alterations', 'sides', 'waist', 'cavill', 'suite', 'little', 'alien', 'touch', 'was', 'awesome', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'bothered', 'case', 'missing', 'iconic', 'red', 'pants', 'giving', 'director', 'snyder', 'reasons', 'not', 'having', 'release', 'so', 'guess', 'i', ""'ll"", 'let', 'have', 'one', 'was', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'period.Now', 'bad', 'things', 'wrong', 'movie', 'when', 'new', 'film', 'struggles', 'be', 'blockbuster', 'should', 'already', 'know', 'now', 'problem', 'problem', 'was', 'movie', 'completely', 'screwed', 'up', 'basically', 'pulled', 'smallville', 'changing', 'everything', 'messing', 'up', 'major', 'superman', 'canon', 'was', 'NOT', 'dc', 'universe', 'matter', 'have', 'true', 'superman', 'mythology', 'implicated', 'garbage', 'flick', 'reason', 'certain', 'things', 'are', 'put', 'place', 'when', 'window', 'lost', 'why', 'sudden', 'do', 'have', 'darken', 'colors', 'superman', 'cloth', 'fit', 'dark', 'knight', 'image', 'persona', 'superman', 'force', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'clothes', 'are', 'bright', 'what', 'also', 'happened', 'truth', 'justice', 'american', 'way', 'time', 'when', 'cavill', 'superman', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'also', 'have', 'do', 'lot', 'collateral', 'damage', 'when', 'actuality', 'superman', 'doing', 'such', 'things', 'knowing', 'people', 'could', 'get', 'hurt', 'i', 'recall', 'part', 'superman', 'fighting', 'technique', 'preserve', 'life', 'cost', 'Superman', 'i', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'no', 'longer', 'american', 'hero', 'instead', 'trying', 'be', 'turned', 'anti', 'cult', 'hero', 'spawn', 'guyver', 'batman', 'even', 'deathstroke', 'been', 'botched', 'masses', 'idiotic', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'R.I.P', 'SupermanIn', 'end', 'when', 'down', 'i', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'REAL', 'superman', 'fans', 'especially', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'comics', 'let', 'alone', 'who', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'would', 'like', 'expand', 'knowledge', 'character', 'who', 'wan', 'learn', 'more', 'superman', 'i', 'would', 'recommend', 'first', '2', 'alexander', 'illya', 'salkind', 'movies', 'christopher', 'reeve', 'want', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'updated', 'version', 'superman', 'movie', 'then', 'watch', 'superman', 'returns', '2006', 'fared', 'much', 'better', 'even', 'movie', ""n't"", 'offer', 'whole', 'lot', 'still', 'latest', 'movie', 'canon', 'superman', 'mythology']",N/A

1561601,AHRQOLXJE4CBV,B008JFUPFI,"JACK LOBO ""ljb926""","[20, 66]","Seriously, this movie sucked plain and simple. I'll tell you why it sucked. Now telling you why it sucked means there's going to be spoilers. So stop reading if A you want to see the movie first, or B you might get your feelings hurt. Right now I don't care about your feelings. I'm telling you right up front I will be making comparisons of this to Superman The Movie and Superman II. First off Henry Cavill is no Superman. Great build? Yes. But if not for the suit he wouldn't look like Superman. Someone started the idea that Clark Kent putting on glasses, changing his hair style, speaking with a lighter voice, and acting unsure of himself made him still too obvious he was still Superman. All of a sudden people are now popping up everywhere that agree with that assessment. Well I don't, that disguise worked just fine for me. As I was saying about Henry Cavill looking like Superman only when he was in the Superman costume. The moment  Christopher Reeve took off the glasses, no matter what he was wearing, he looked like Superman. Even when he gave up his powers and had the fluffed hair and the civvies he STILL looked like Superman. But when the glasses went back on... Hey! Where did Superman go? They pulled it off brilliantly. Now for the opening of Man of Steel we're given an in depth and unique view of Krypton. Flying dragons and babies in underwater bubbles? I rolled with it. Russell Crowe? I did not think his Jor-El was all that spectacular, and that he was the best Jor-El ever. It was solid, but nothing to write home about. He may have been given more to do, but it wasn't better than Marlon Brando's Jor-El. I'm sorry, but it just wasn't. Now after General Zod made his trouble on Krypton he and his brigade are mummified then put into a weird ship that once they're on the ship they're no longer mummified. With Krypton moments away from total destruction, and Zod and crew safely aboard a vessel of sorts, in what rational universe is this a punishment? So the planet goes KaPow! and Baby Kal-El is on his way to earth. Now we jump to Clark being full grown on some sort of fishing freighter. He disappears to save people on an oil tanker. Good for him. But when he busts through that room to open the door with all the flames all around him, nobody acts shocked or startled. I would have been freaking out and screaming if I saw that. Now there is just way too much jumping around in this movie to go into every detail. So let's just skip to Lois Lane. On second thought. Let's just skip Lois Lane. Other reviewers have already established  the faux pas with all that, and get to the meat and potatoes of this movie. General Zod. Why on Earth would he want to turn Earth into a second Krypton. Once he did that he would no longer have his cool super powers. At least the General Zod of Superman II was more rational in his thinking to want to use his powers to rule the earth. Now the big battles. In Man of Steel we have the realistic premise of total destruction of a major city if super beings battle with each other. Realistic premise, but it didn't LOOK real. CGI may look real to you gamers, but it doesn't look real to me. It has that high end video game cartoonish look. Everything was moving too fast. I know Kryptonians are supposed to move with blinding speed, but if I'm not enjoying what I'm watching doesn't that defeat the purpose of making a movie? In Superman II it really looked like Superman tossed Zod into the giant electric Coca Cola sign. It looked like Ursa frisbeed a manhole cover at Superman. Or Non getting knocked upward through a skyscraper. That and a whole lot more looked much realer than anything in this Man of Steel movie. Regardless of whether you think the first two Superman movies were hokey or silly, you can't deny that the people involved didn't put a lot of love, effort, sweat, and determination to truly give us great Superman movies. Well at least the first two. Be honest, was there one single moment in this movie that made you want to clap or cheer when Superman performed a heroic act? In Superman, his first revealing to the world when he saved Lois from the helicopter incident sent goose bumps up my spine. Then he catches the falling helicopter. That made me verklempt. Or him saving the children in the school bus that was almost going to go off the bridge in the first movie, becoming more exciting as a recap in the second movie set to Ken Thorne's rousing musical version of John William's original work. Which brings me to the score of Man of Steel. There were moments when the music was serviceable, but not spectacular. I'll end my review here. If I wish to add more I will do so.",1,THIS MOVIE SUCKED.,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,4672,"['Seriously', 'movie', 'sucked', 'plain', 'simple', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'why', 'sucked', 'Now', 'telling',

1561605,A1BATHNY2QAZI2,B008JFUPFI,"Jaime Contreras ""donjaime""","[3, 6]","For me, this movie worked because it is told as the tale of a reluctant hero who is uncomfortable with his fate. The movie is one of self-discovery of where he comes from, who he is and what he must do. Henry Cavill plays Kal-El/Clark Kent with the perfect mix of reluctance and self-doubt. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are perfect as the loving surrogate/adoptive parents (Martha and Jonathan Kent) who know the truth and love the boy. As Clark grows and discovers his extraordinary powers, he retreats. He almost seems afraid of 'who' he is. In time, Clark Kent is told he is not of this Earth. As a young man, Clark begins a sojourn of self-discovery and flight. Eventually, he becomes a solitary force of one who helps others in dire straits. In time, an intrepid reporter,Lois Lane (Amy Adams) tracks him down. Simultaneously, an enemy, General Zod (Michael Shannon) of his father, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) comes looking for revenge and Kal-El. It is when the world is threatened and his loved ones are in peril that Clark/Kal-El embraces the mantle of protector that he becomes a hero, a symbol for the world.

1561608,A1IIBAE9HHDEMW,B008JFUPFI,J. Alvarez,"[24, 76]","I wasn't expecting much to begin with from this film since I consider the 1977 SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE an amazing film that beautifully captures the essence of what Superman is.  After watching this film, I don't have high homps for this new, twisted franchise that made SUPERMAN RETURNS look like a masterpiece.It's the screenwriter's and the director's job to establish a cohesive storyline that resolve every point it inserts into the film.  It makes sense to leave a few crumbs that will establish the next set of stories for the franchise but this film did a horrid job of creating a character people can relate to.Watch it for yourself and see.  You may like it or you may hate it as much as I do since this film is so divisive.SPOILERS BELOW -- YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!The things they tried to pull off in this movie were just unbearable ---The Codex is absolutely BS. Another useless plot point. What the hell was this skull all about and why was it so important? All I saw was a skull jizzing into the embryos of Kryptonians. Granted the connection of Lois to Superman was leaked throughout the news but that doesn't justify taking her back to the ship at all. Again, it was a simple way to use her as a way for Superman to escape, nothing more.- About this environment BS, we all know Superman gets his power from the sun. They decide to through this wrench of environment issues just to make it ""believable"". Seems like MAN OF STEEL raided AVATAR's closet by having people ride flying animals in Krypton and throwing in the ""we're having atmospheric issues"" for good measure. Superman had over 30 years to get over it but it took Zod 5 min? Please. Lack of atmosphere didn't seem to be an issue for Superman when he decided to fly to the edge of space where there's no atmosphere whatsoever. He seemed happy and ""breathing"" fine.- With regards to terraforming Earth, what's the point? If Krypton sent thousands of ships for exploration and not 1 was able to create a habitable world after their amazing ""terraforming"", why the hell would Zod think it would work in this instance (BTW, Zod states he's a warrior while Jor El is a Scientist. How the hell were these brute warriors smart enough to change the Phantom Zone equipment to a Warp Drive? Thought that's what scientists do, not warriors). Looks to me the scientists messed up big time developing that terraforming machine.- What was the point of showing a ship with an kryptonian empty pod?  To me it looked like the director wanted to imply that a Kryptonian did survive when the ship crash landed 20,000 yrs ago and may even be alive.  What happened to that plot point?  Forgotten, much like the brains of the creators of this abomination.- Couldn't stand the embryos-in-a-ship plotpoint as it held the potential for a can of worms. As for Superman playing abortion doctor, the embryos were on the ship AKA the ""Fortress"" of Solitude that landed over 20,000 years ago that Superman discovers in Canada. The ship was undisturbed for al that time until he showed up. If Superman is supposed to be the only hope for ""his people"" he should have found a way to acclimate them to this world. If HE could survive, why can't they?- If a group of people as strong as Superman were in town and I were Superman, I would tell them to get the hell out of town. And if the people decided to run screaming, I wouldn't blame them for one bit. That's when genocide comes knocking on your door. A quiet community suddenly disturbed in such a fashion would certainly cause understandable fear and panic. I wouldn't tell them to stay in their homes or businesses. That was just insane to me. If he would have at least moved the fight elsewhere, it would have shown that he was thinking about the welfare of others, not just his mom or Lois.- Fact is two ships came straight to the Kent Farm to find the Cryo-ship that held Kal El to find the codex (stupid codex). No other reason than that. Can't say there weren't looking as Zod was so pissed that he flipped the car into the house. If the military noticed this (in real life they would have), they would ask: Why go there? What's so important there? Must be important if Lois Lane was at the house to. (Hell, ET handled the arrival of an alien better than this turd).- Superman's Cryo-Ship. How was that even picked up by the military? They don't know where it is except Superman and Ma Kent. Lois knows how to kickoff the phantom zone but needs the ship. Last I checked, Lois isn't Supergirl nor did she have a spare tow truck lying around. All we see is the ship sitting on a military truck about to be loaded onto a plane. Why didn't Superman just fly the Cryo-ship to the plane? What the hell was he doing that was so important that he couldn't do it himself (risking the exposure of his identity)? Wouldn't that raise questions?- Superman killing Zod was a low point that was immediately followed up with a shallow comedic scene involving unmanned surveillance plane. People keep comparing Superman to a cop who has to sometimes use lethal force. Difference is a cop isn't faster than a speeding bullet. If cops we're they wouldn't need guns. Why didn't Superman just cover Zod's eyes when he was shooting heat vision at a family of idiots? Why stand there when you can, I don't know, move to the right & out the door? Why didn't Superman just pull a KILL BILL 2 and rip Zod's eyes out (or at the very least gouge them)? Killing is ok but eye removal is too much? You can't heat what you can't see and you certainly can't heat without eyes. Since solar radiation is what powers Kryptonians, why didn't Superman just bury Zod deep in the ground and surround him in lead (lead blocks radiation)? He'd be blind and unable to stay powered without the Sun's Ray. If friggin' smoke from a terraforming machine can weaken Superman in South Asia, why can't he do something similar to Zod?I love Superman and his history but this movie butchered the character's image. Amazed people don't realize what they're watching. Puppets just enjoying the half-assed special effects and glossing over the obvious mistakes the film had.Comics Alliance and Mark Waid (writer of SUPERMAN: BIRTHRIGHT and KINGDOM COME) wrote on this

1561609,A1YS3I3BIO5M7B,B008JFUPFI,James D. Best,"[6, 10]","When I saw Man of Steel in the theater, I was disappointed. Actually, more than disappointed. My first words to my wife were, &#8220;I hated that movie.&#8221; My wife felt differently, so I decided to give it a second chance. I still hate the film.Man of Steel is a prime example of Hollywood&#8217;s penchant for CGI over storytelling. We don&#8217;t need characters, just eye-popping explosions with booming sound effects. I&#8217;m a fan of Amy Adams, but in this film she came across flat. And Perry White? What was that about? His role contributed nothing to the storyline. This darker Superman moves in the direction of an anti-hero, so perhaps that explains his complete lack of humor. The bad guys and gal were unmemorable, which is crucial to storytelling.When director Zack Snyder met with his CGI geeks, I&#8217;ll bet the conversation went like this:&#8220;We got some really terrific stuff,&#8221; the head-honcho geek says. &#8220;We put together thirty sequences of Superman and Zod crashing through buildings so you can pick the ones you like.&#8221;After watching the special effects, Snyder slaps the honcho guy on the back and says, &#8220;Nice work. We&#8217;ll use &#8216;em all.&#8221;&#8220;Okay, what about the fanciful creatures on Krypton? We&#8217;re over budget.&#8221;&#8220;Just slap something together. Maybe adjust some of that flying dragon stuff you used before. Just get something quick and cheap.&#8221;The CGI was intended to appeal to the younger, hearing-impaired market, but some hacks also tried to wrench the plot around to appeal to women. One of the major themes of the saga is Lois Lane trying to discover the identity of Superman. But some Hollywood genius said women want romance, and they&#8217;re unwilling to wait for a sequel. Simple. We&#8217;ll discard that useless bit of tinsel and rewrite Lane as the strong champion and savior of Superman, and that way they can flirt from the gitgo.I could be wrong, of course. Man of Steel may be a classic. A smart retooling of the saga for a modern worldwide audience. The movie did gross nearly $300 million in the United States alone. However, it cost somewhere around a quarter billion dollars. Even with foreign box office and home rentals, that does not qualify as a blockbuster.I might be a curmudgeon, but I liked the original Superman better. I preferred the humor and light tone and creativity. The domestic gross was three times the budget, so they must have got something right.",2,Hollywood Gone Wrong,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,2484,"['When', 'saw', 'Man', 'Steel', 'theater', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Actually', 'more', 'disappointed', 'first', 'words', 'wife', 'were', '8220', 'hated', 'movie.', '8221', 'My', 'wife', 'felt', 'differently', 'decided', 'give', 'second', 'chance', 'still', 'hate', 'film.Man', 'Steel', 'prime', 'example', 'Hollywood', '8217', 'penchant', 'CGI', 'storytelling', 'don', '8217', 'need', 'characters', 'just', 'eye-popping', 'explosions', 'booming', 'sound', 'effects', '8217', 'fan', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'film', 'came', 'flat', 'Perry', 'White', 'What', 'was', 'role', 'contributed', 'nothing', 'storyline', 'darker', 'Superman', 'direction', 'anti-hero', 'perhaps', 'complete', 'lack', 'humor', 'bad', 'guys', 'gal', 'were', 'unmemorable', 'crucial', 'storytelling.When', 'director', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'met', 'CGI', 'geeks', '8217', 'bet', 'conversation', 'went', '8220', 'got', 'really', 'terrific', 'stuff', '8221', 'head-honcho', 'geek', '8220', 'put', 'together', 'thirty', 'sequences', 'Superman', 'Zod', 'crashing', 'buildings', 'can', 'pick', 'ones', 'like.', '8221', 'watching', 'special', 'effects', 'Snyder', 'honcho', 'guy', 'back', '8220', 'Nice', 'work', '8217', 'use', '8216', 'all.', '8221', '8220', 'Okay', 'what', 'fanciful', 'creatures', 'Krypton', '8217', 're', 'budget.', '8221', '8220', 'Just', 'slap', 'something', 'together', 'Maybe', 'adjust', 'flying', 'dragon', 'stuff', 'used', 'Just', 'get', 'something', 'quick', 'cheap.', '8221', 'CGI', 'was', 'intended', 'appeal', 'younger', 'hearing-impaired', 'market', 'hacks', 'also', 'tried', 'wrench', 'plot', 'appeal', 'women', 'One', 'major', 'themes', 'saga', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'trying', 'discover', 'identity', 'Superman', 'Hollywood', 'genius', 'said', 'women', 'want', 'romance', '8217', 're', 'unwilling', 'wait', 'sequel', 'Simple', '8217', 'discard', 'useless', 'bit', 'tinsel', 'rewrite', 'Lane', 'strong', 'champion', 'savior', 'Superman', 'way', 'can', 'flirt', 'gitgo.I', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'course', 'Man', 'Steel', 'may', 'be', 'classic', 'smart', 'retooling', 'saga', 'modern', 'worldwide', 'audience', 'movie', 'did', 'gross', 'nearly', '300', 'million', 'United', 'States', 'alone', 'However', 'cost', 'somewhere', 'quarter', 'billion', 'dollars', 'Even', 'foreign', 'box', 'office', 'home', 'rentals', 'not', 'qualify', 'blockbuster.I', 'might', 'be', 'curmudgeon', 'liked', 'original', 'Superman', 'better', 'preferred', 'humor', 'light', 'tone', 'creativity', 'domestic', 'gross', 'was', 'three', 'times', 'budget', 'must', 'have', 'got', 'something', 'right']",N/A

1561612,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B008JFUPFI,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[5, 13]","Arguably, the best pedigree for a superhero/comic book film comes from having the involvement of either Joss Whedon (who gave us last summer's brilliant AVENGERS) or Christopher Nolan (who gave us the epic, extraordinary DARK KNIGHT trilogy). Marvel Studios will continue to benefit from the involvement of Whedon, but Warner Bros, and its DC Entertainment subsidiary, is continuing to benefit from the involvement of Nolan, whose more grounded and realistic take on Batman was sought out to bring DC's preeminent superhero, Superman, to big-budget film once again. Of the five theatrical releases that preceded this summer, it's still the first one, Richard Donner's 1978 SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE that was held for years as the gold standard of how to make a great superhero film. It was filled with solid performances, imagery that was breathtaking for the time, and really framed the character of Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman in a way that would come to define him for three decades. But now, it's time for a new take, and that comes via the mind of Nolan, his co-creator of the DARK KNIGHT trilogy David S. Goyer, and ""visionary"" director Zack Snyder to reboot the character of Kal-El and bring him down to Earth once again in the visceral yet heavy MAN OF STEEL.From its opening somber notes on Krypton, as Jor-El (a terrific Russell Crowe) continues to be the lone voice in the wilderness predicting the imminent implosion of the planet, and General Zod (a strong Michael Shannon) looks to protect Krypton's heritage that may or may not involve the destruction of some of Krypton's most influential houses (to tell the truth, I'm still a little fuzzy on that plot point), Jor-El risks everything to send his infant son to Earth, along with something called The Codex, which seems to mean everything to the planet's history and heritage. Once the rocket is launched, the audience is immediately whisked into the present, where we see the 33-year-old Clark Kent (a fine Henry Cavill with very big shoes to fill) working odd jobs and trying to find his way in the world. Strange twists of fate begin to weave together as Clark eventually comes face-to-face with Pulitzer Prize-Winning journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams, doing a lot of good work as per usual) as they both end up investigating a 20,000 year-old Kryptonian ship buried in the ice in the Great White North. As the present goes on, we get glimpses of Clark's life as a young man and of his adoptive parents Jonathan (Kevin Costner, doing some of his best work in years) and Martha Kent (a strong Diane Lane) back in Smallville. He strives for identity and purpose and his parents look to give that to him, but still he feels utterly alone. So when the presence of General Zod arrives on Earth, Kal starts to become even more torn between his Kryptonian and Human sides. As Zod reveals himself to be more of a monster, though, Kal-El uses his very super powers and fights his own kind to save Earth and along the way, he picks up the nickname ""Superman"".First, the good things about this film. By and large, the performances are very good, with the standouts being both the fathers of Kal/Clark, Crowe and Costner respectively. Lane, Shannon, and supporting players like Christopher Meloni, Harry Lennix, Laurence Fishburne and Richard Schiff are all strong in their roles. Adams is very solid, and I appreciated the efforts that Snyder and company take to give Lois more to do other than being the damsel-in-distress that her representation has so often shown in the films. Cavill seems kind of tailor-made to play the adult Kal/Clark; he has perfectly chiseled good looks and is built perfectly, but time will tell if they end up going in the direction of the more bumbling and cowardly Clark Kent persona, since we don't get around to that, but that leads us to another strong note: This reboot has enough surprises to keep you on your toes, particularly when it comes to the physicality of Jor-El (who frankly after being played by Marlon Brando, just about anyone would be more physical), and especially the beginnings of the relationship between Lois and Clark. I won't spoil it here, but it plays out much differently than in any incarnation we've seen of this couple before. The special effects and also the art direction by Alex McDowell are extraordinary. Also this film gives us something we've never really seen in a Superman film, which brings us to a mix of great and not-so-great: it shows us Superman FIGHTING. Now, fans of the series and of the character have seen this to some extent before during SUPERMAN II, and also during SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE. Other than those fun but ultimately unsatisfying fights, we have seen Superman lift impossibly heavy things and fly so fast, he could reverse time... but in MAN OF STEEL, we see him let loose with all of his power in fights that plow combatants miles away or demolish towns.This is part of the problem as I stated earlier, because the final act of this film is a long orgiastic eruption of fighting, violence and rampant destruction which veers a little too far into the area of what people have termed ""Disaster Porn"". We see a pretty large portion of Smallville and especially Metropolis being reduced to complete rubble in a way that feels uncomfortably reminiscent of images from 9/11. To add even further injury, Kal doesn't really seem to care about all the people he's apparently trying to save, with maybe the exception of Lois. As he and his foes pound each other through skyscrapers and businesses (some of which are certain to have people in them), he doesn't show the concern that the long-established characterization of Superman has shown. He always puts the safety of people first unless he simply has no choice, and that is something that is really shown in the finale of the confrontation between Kal and Zod, and Kal makes a choice there that will likely upset a great many true Superman fans. Also, the film does seem a little too heavy at times for a Superman film, and many times, just seems tonally inconsistent. Goyer's script is smart more often than it's dumb, but this seems like a very average effort for his talents. Snyder thankfully does away with all of his slow-fast-slow combat sequences that he practiced VERY heavily in 300, WATCHMEN and SUCKER PUNCH, but this still doesn't make him the ""visionary"" director that he's hyped as. Some of the camera work also is a little jarring as it seems to switch from steady to shaky at any given moment.However, there are more good moments than bad in this film, which leads me to give this latest effort of bringing the mythology of Superman to the big screen again a positive review. I can only hope that better things lie ahead for the Man of Steel in the future on the big screen.3.5 out of 5 stars.",3,An otherwise solid STEEL unfortunately breaks when it should

1561613,AHMRHGIWPMQPI,B008JFUPFI,James D. Porter,"[4, 12]","Ive always loved the first Chris Reeve Superman film from the 70's and the second one wasnt half bad either.  This new film ""Man of Steel"" has a lot of good things going for it but most of the movie deals with an alien invasion that steals the show.  Zod and his cronies from Krypton attempt to take over the planet earth with their scary technology much like the martians did in ""War of the Worlds"".We dont even get to see Clark in his glasses working with Louis at the Daily Planet!

Superman created by Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster.Fans who fondly remember and still enjoy the Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" moviesThe Christopher Reeve Superman Collection (Superman - The Movie / Superman II / Superman III / Superman IV - The Quest for Peace)(1978-87) may enjoy this re-telling of Clark Kent/Superman, but there are many differences.The movie begins on the planet Krypton. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) is awaiting his wife, Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer), to give birth to their newborn baby. It is a son and he is named ""Kal-El"".Later, General Zod (Michael Shannon), kills the Kryptonian Council. Jor-El swims into the Genesis Chamber and obtains a skull that has the codex to continue the Kryptonian race. This is exactly what the evil, General Zod is after because he wants the power.Knowing himself and his wife will not survive the destruction of Krypton, he puts his newborn son in a spaceship with the codex. The spaceship lands in Smallville, Kansas. Kal-El is found by Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane).That is all I'm going to tell you. You will have to buy this DVD to find out the rest.After you see this movie, you will want to be Superman too.May be the first time we see Superman with chest hair poking over his suit.Also in the cast: Amy Adams as ""Lois Lane"", Laurence Fishburne as ""Perry White"".Cooper Timberline, Dylan Sprayberry, Jadin Gould, Christopher Meloni, Mackenzie Gray, Joe Minoso.Some people think they see a very subtle image of Christopher Reeve's face in a few frames of film. Henry Cavill morphs into Reeve done by CGI-effects. It is too quick to be inconclusive. We will have to wait until the DVD release to see it better.The characters of Ursa, Non, Lex Luthor and Jimmy Olsen are not in this remake.In-film advertising: IHOP Restaurant, 7-Eleven Store, Sears, Kenmore, Norad, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U-Haul.Henry Cavill will be in the film, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., as ""Napoleon Solo"", to be released January 16, 2015.

Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[6, 12]","Directed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen), Man of Steel is a re-telling of Superman's origins, where Kal-El, or Clark Kent to humanity, must protect the Earth from General Zod, who was banished for war crimes and has come back to save and &#34;advance&#34; their race after their planet is destroyed, wiping out most of the Kryptonians. But as General Zod raises the stakes and begins to cause utter chaos and destruction, Kent learns that he must go beyond what he knows if he is to save us.Man of Steel is, by far, the best Superman film to date. I will admit, I am of a younger generation and was not there to see the first Superman hit screens, but I still liked it when I saw it, and I still do. But this Superman doesn't necessarily stick to the comics more-so (more than the other films, in certain respects) but it captures Superman in a different light. When we see Kent in other films, he's already become part of society and saves the day when need be. Here, Kent is an outsider, and he doesn't know what to do with his life. He's always moving, going state to state and job to job, never settling down. But when he discovers an ancient Kryptonian craft the government is trying to excavate, he finds out the truth of who he is and where he came from. But it's when General Zod comes, when he discovers his true purpose in life; his destiny. Zack's directing is superb, capturing the epic scope of a Christopher Nolan film (who also produced this), all the while showing the scale as well, instead of just a small look at the conflict. The acting is great, especially Michael Shannon as Zod, who is both terrifying and yet, somewhat understandable. Russell Crowe was also incredible, and very deserving of an Oscar nomination along side Shannon. Cavil is damn good as Superman, but it's Crowe and Shannon who stand out the most. The visual effects are top-notch, Hans Zimmer's musical score is haunting and grand, and the script is good. It's not award-winning, but very memorable and worthy of note.Man of Steel is not for everyone, but is a great sci-fi epic. I also wanted to say, not only am I disappointed with the critics (like most), but I don't understand comments on the character development. Superman does develop over the course of the film, greatly. From discovering who he is, &#34;adapting&#34; to disasters that have befallen him over time (shown through flashbacks), and a price he paid dearly at the end of the film, when he's left with no choice.

Another re-boot of a classic comic book (""graphic novel"") ready to be one of the box office smashes of the summer. Be warned...this thing is looooong (143 minutes), so watch your liquid intake! I found it interesting that in the packed screening last night, I didn't see ONE person dash out for a quick potty break, everyone was fascinated as we watched a little boy learn to cope with x-ray vision, super hearing and uncommon strength. I had never given it a second thought, had you?We have:* Henry Cavill (""Immortals"") is our appealing new Kal-El/Superman. I hope this Brit is ready for the inevitable wave of publicity.

He's craggier than Christopher Reeve, but has that same impossibly good-looking, sweet presence.* Amy Adams (""Trouble with the Curve"") is Lois Lane, the bright-eyed reporter who is in his face from the get-go. She's too smart and is eager to spill the beans about our hero's identity. What a scoop!* Russell Crowe (""Les Miserables"") as Jor-El, sends his infant son from Krypton, his own doomed planet. The heart and soul of this 90-minute plot is contained in that decision.* Kevin Costner (""Hatfields & McCoys"") is Jonathan Kent the wise corn farmer who pulls that infant from the space capsule and raises him as his own.

1561644,A20NWLD1RSX06X,B008JFUPFI,"jedi105 ""jedi105""","[1, 6]","My first reaction to ""Man of Steel"" when I heard about it being made was .... Zack Snyder... Who the heck is Zack Snyder. Then I thought, OMG, Not that guy who made The Watchmen and (gulp) Suckerpunch. 2 of the worst comic book movies in my opinion. Only Daredevil and the Ang Lee Hulk film are worse. Then I realized, well... he did also make 300. Now that was a good movie. So even though I was concerned that a director who had 3 of the biggest stinkers I ever watched (lets not forget Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole)to his credit, I figured Nolan would be the one to set the tone. Nolans story was well fleshed out. Yes, we have seen all of this before but it is necessary to do an origins story when trying to reboot a franchise. Batman Begins was excellent and I hoped Man of Steel would be equally so. I wasn't disappointed. Between Nolan's story and Snyders action sequences, it was a very good escape. That is not to say it was perfect or it didn't have its flaws. It did. My biggest gripe was the final battle between Superman and Zod. It was certainly action packed but I felt like the director was simply trying to ""one up"" the Avengers. The destruction of Metropolis was too extreme. Every other building was falling down and in the end, it looked like a nuclear bomb went off. I know that was the point, after all, you had 2 indestructible god like beings battling it out, but again, I just thought it was too much. When Superman finally won that battle, by breaking his biggest rule, I genuinely felt for Superman. I could feel his anguish, and I give credit to Henry Cavill. I was very concerned when I heard he was going to play Superman but when I saw him in the suit, I thought to myself, He IS Superman. The rest of the cast was absolutely perfect. Kevin Costner was totally believable and Russell Crowe was a perfect Jor El. The wonam who played Lara (Supermans biological mother) was heartbreaking as was Diane Lane as Martha Kent. Even Zod's second in command was wonderfully cast. Amy Adams was absolutely beautiful and perfect for Lois Lane. That leaves me with my second gripe. Zod....Michael Shannon, Umm, No. He is a good actor but I did not feel him as Zod for even a second. But then, After Terence Stamp, no one really has a prayer of pulling off Zod. When Stamp so arrogantly commanded ""Kneel before Zod"", yeah, you know what I'm saying. Shannon was a suitable villian, but he just didnt ""feel"" like Zod to me. My third biggest gripe, and its a whopper..... Not once did we hear the signature Superman theme. Yes, I know it was a reboot and they wanted to get as far away from the earlier movies as possible, but Superman, above ALL OTHER super heroes, is identified by his theme music from the original Superman movie. I usually like Hans Zimmers musical scores, but this one was so lacking. Part of it actually sounded like a previous score he did and to me, that is blasphemy. John Williams would never rehash his music for different movies. The decision to avoid the Superman theme music was wrong.

Yet the concept behind Man Of Steel is not one that allows the revisiting of the same exact Superman from Donner's films or the one that many grew up with.  That's not to say that this Superman does not share the values of that Superman - he does.  Yet Snyder, Goyer, and Nolan are more interested in HOW he got to that point and how the world would truly react if a superpowered being lived among us.  There's a reason why massive destruction happens when Kal-El fights - because he is THAT powerful.  Frankly, I'm not sure that any superhero has the overall power of Superman.  It is his power that also makes him most interesting.  For years, Superman has been seen as a mere Boy Scout.  He does the right thing.  He's the good guy.  But why?Let's think about this.  If you were the most powerful person on the planet, capable of taking out whole military detachments by yourself, would you SERVE humanity or decide to DOMINATE it?  The most amazing thing about Superman is his CHOICE to serve, not to control.  We have so often taken this aspect of the character for granted, yet the filmmakers delve into this superbly.  At the heart of the reason are Martha and Jonathon, played superbly by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane.  It is through their love and care of young Clark that he matures and becomes Superman.There are so many things to praise here, from the score to the plot to the pacing to the effects.  It is also worth noting that the screenwriter has stated that the destruction will be an issue in the second film and is also a reason why people do not fully trust Superman.If you can, separate yourself from the past.  Christopher Reeve was wonderful in his day, but this is not that Superman.  It is the modern Superman that lives in a more complex world that would not embrace him unthinkingly.Henry Cavill is also wonderful here, as is the entire cast.  Frankly, this movie doesn't miss a beat at all.  And the Special Features with the Blu-Ray reveal even more.  There are many things that I thought were not special effects that were.  The amount of detail the set and design was given is incredible.  You can just see the love so many had for this project.With Man Of Steel, Superman soars like never before.  This film will tug on your heart strings, cause you to cheer, and let you look in wonder at Superman once more.  It is the greatest of the modern slew of comic book films, surpassing even the wonderful The Dark Knight and far exceeding anything done by Marvel (and most of that HAS been quite good).",5,Superman Soars,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,2717,"['controversy', 'mind', 'minor', 'surrounded', 'film', 'release', 'shed', 'great', 'light', 'affection', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'Superman', 'least', 'how', 'dear', 'THEIR', 'idea', 'Superman', 'concept', 'Man', 'Steel', 'not', 'one', 'revisiting', 'same', 'exact', 'Superman', 'Donner', 'films', 'one', 'many', 'grew', 'up', 'not', 'say', 'Superman', 'not', 'share', 'values', 'Superman', 'Snyder', 'Goyer', 'Nolan', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'HOW', 'got', 'point', 'how', 'world', 'would', 'truly', 'react', 'superpowered', 'being', 'lived', 'reason', 'why', 'massive', 'destruction', 'when', 'Kal-El', 'fights', 'powerful', 'Frankly', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'superhero', 'overall', 'power', 'Superman', 'power', 'also', 'most', 'interesting', 'years', 'Superman', 'been', 'seen', 'mere', 'Boy', 'Scout', 'right', 'thing', 'good', 'guy', 'why', 'Let', 'think', 'were', 'most', 'powerful', 'person', 'planet', 'capable', 'taking', 'out', 'whole', 'military', 'detachments', 'would', 'SERVE', 'humanity', 'decide', 'DOMINATE', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'Superman', 'CHOICE', 'serve', 'not', 'control', 'have', 'so', 'often', 'taken', 'aspect', 'character', 'granted', 'yet', 'filmmakers', 'delve', 'superbly', 'heart', 'reason', 'are', 'Martha', 'Jonathon', 'played', 'superbly', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'love', 'care', 'young', 'Clark', 'Superman.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'praise', 'here', 'score', 'plot', 'pacing', 'effects', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'screenwriter', 'stated', 'destruction', 'will', 'be', 'issue', 'second', 'film', 'also', 'reason', 'why', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'fully', 'trust', 'Superman.If', 'can', 'separate', 'past', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'was', 'wonderful', 'day', 'not', 'Superman', 'modern', 'Superman', 'more', 'complex', 'world', 'would', 'not', 'embrace', 'unthinkingly.Henry', 'Cavill', 'also', 'wonderful', 'here', 'entire', 'cast', 'Frankly', 'movie', ""n't"", 'miss', 'beat', 'Special', 'Features', 'Blu-Ray', 'reveal', 'even', 'more', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'thought', 'were', 'not', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'amount', 'detail', 'set', 'design', 'was', 'given', 'incredible', 'can', 'just', 'see', 'love', 'so', 'many', 'had', 'project.With', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Superman', 'never', 'before', 'film', 'will', 'tug', 'heart', 'strings', 'cause', 'cheer', 'let', 'look', 'wonder', 'Superman', 'once', 'more', 'greatest', 'modern', 'slew', 'comic', 'book', 'films', 'surpassing', 'even', 'wonderful', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'far', 'exceeding', 'anything', 'done', 'Marvel', 'most', 'HAS', 'been', 'quite', 'good']",N/A

I know a lot of people were on the fence about the amount of action and violence in this movie but this film has a HIGHLY realistic tone. If you want a campy, fun loving, almost cartoonish take on what an alien invasion in a major city would be like then The Avengers is for you. The climax of this film is basically what would happen if a large alien force invaded a city and there was only ONE super powered being present to fight off the attack in a realistic way. There are real consequences to the battles in this film. The action is over the top and looks amazing.The music in this film is amazing as well. I honestly didn't think the John Williams score could ever be topped but that music was for Christopher Reeve and the music in this film is PERFECT. When the main score kicks in at the end of the film if you're a true Superman fan you'll get Goosebumps and it will make you anticipate the sequel even more.All of the performances in this movie are amazing. Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe are amazing as Superman's Earth and Krypton father respectively. Henry Cavill IS Superman. This guy isn't just doing his best Christopher Reeve impersonation. He takes the role and makes it his own. He is jacked beyond belief and just looks like he could tear a city apart with his bare hands. There are times where he's standing there in the Superman costume not even speaking and you just KNOW that this guy IS Superman.The special features are very, very good and loaded with entertaining and interesting stuff.

Their Batman Begins like script with all the flashbacks to Clark's childhood didn't work as well for Superman and slowed the film down too much.

Laurence Fishburne is a great actor but so far him being cast as Perry White seems to just be for the hell of it and not because he was perfect for the part.I am a fan of the Nolan's but they need to realize that Superman films need to be a little whimsical and have some humor.

Superman was my favorite. The story line follows the comics to some extent and yet it also develops its own new Superman genre. I can accept that and see how they were trying to create an interesting and fast action movie.

1561671,A4GPHAI2LRIQI,B008JFUPFI,"JJD ""John""","[30, 46]","Having seen the film nearly a week ago, I wanted to take a few days to let it all soak in. I wanted to be able to highlight what was done right and what was done wrong as objectively as possible. Despite the fact that I know many of the folks here gave it a stellar five-star review, I simply couldn't. I wanted to love this film so much and, while I enjoyed it, I couldn't help but feel something was missing. Upon much deliberation and thought on the matter, the most nagging question that came to mind was...""Where is the JOY??"".I was nine years old when my father took my brothers and I to see Richard Donner's Superman film the day after Christmas in 78. As a kid, it was a mind-blowing experience. From the opening credits to the iconic shot of Chris Reeve as he smiles passing over Earth, it was enchanting and beyond what I thought Superman could be. Granted, I was NINE at the time. However, to this day, it still holds up as a fun and visually breathtaking film. For my money, I still maintain it's the best ""superhero movie"" ever made. Now...I know what many of you are going to say. The typical argument against those critics who took issue with Man Of Steel is that they are too set in their ways and vision, as if living in the past and kneeling at the altar of Donner's classic interpretation. I would certainly concede that is valid to a degree. However, I went into it expecting something different and more ""today"". I'll admit that, while I love the Donner film, it is certainly dated in terms of special effects and had a rather silly plot at times. That said, despite what would now be seen as shortcomings to the film, it had something that Man Of Steel was lacking in spades. It's an element that should be at the very center of a character that has remained a symbol of hope and goodness for seventy-five years. Quite simply, it lacked ""heart"".Having been absolutely ""gutted"" when I saw Superman Returns seven years ago, I was absolutely thrilled when it was announced that Christopher Nolan and David Goyer (the team that brought Batman back from the cinematic dead after Joel Schumacher's horrid take on the character in the mid-to-late nineties) would be taking on Superman for a new generation. Moreso, I was positively stoked that Zack Snyder, the man that brought ""Watchmen"" to the screen, would be at the helm as director. I knew Snyder had a penchant for visually stunning action sequences and very comic-styled scenery. I figured if anyone could bring Supes back from Bryan Singer's abysmal ""Returns"", it would be them. Of course, after some thought on the matter, it occured to me that maybe Nolan and Goyer, who grounded Batman in a quasi realistic world, might not be the right people to handle Superman. Let's be honest. Superman and Batman are polar opposites. Batman is, by his very nature, a troubled and dark vigilante. ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" were befitting for that character (although Nolan ""nuked the fridge"" with ""Dark Knight Rises""). Superman, on the other hand, is Earth's favorite adopted son. The character is grounded in religious iconography (more Moses than Jesus in my opinion), classic mythological archetypes (think Hercules), and raised by ""salt of the earth"" midwestern farmers to give him an absolute moral center. Batman is ""grey"" and Superman is ""black and white"" or ""right and wrong"". This is why their shared stories have a great dichotomy. As a team, they're great foils for each other...but separately, their stories should be as different as ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Wizard Of Oz"".Now, with all that in mind, let me give my opinion on what they got RIGHT.Krypton was fantastic!! This was the only area where I thought this film surpassed Donner's crystaline world. There was a hierarchy involved. You had the counsel, the scientists, and the military. I thought the notion of a world with genetically engineered offspring was fascinating and the notion of Kal-El being the first ""natural"" birth in centuries was intriguing. Russell Crowe, as Jor-El, hit it out of the park. Crowe brought a bit of Gladiator's Maximus to the table. He carried himself with nobility and fearlessness as the father of Earth's mightiest hero and prophet of Krypton's doom. Michael Shannon's Zod was stoic and convincing as Krypton's military leader who sought to preserve their culture and heritage. This is another plot point I thought was well done. Zod was not a clear-cut villain who only sought revenge. Like most military leaders throughout history, he carried out his machinations with the best of intentions for his people. Those are usually the best kind of antagonists, the ones that truly feel they are on the side of right. If there's a true villain (in the ""love to hate"" sense) in this movie, it's Zod's right-hand Faora. Played with delicious coldness by Antje Traue, Faora is really fun to watch. Her motives aren't as noble as Zod's in that she seems to relish the violence she inflicts.When the film moves to Earth, it immediately cuts to an adult Clark Kent. Unlike the traditional origin story, the film tells Clark's story through multiple flashbacks. It's an interesting device that works in the sense that we don't have to wait a full hour to see Superman come into the picture. It's not unlike Mark Waid's brilliant ""Superman: Birthright"" mini series, where Clark, before taking on the mantle of Superman, goes on a soul-searching trek to find his place in the world.Kevin Costner takes on the role of Jonathan Kent with his usual earnestness and Diane Lane was an inspired choice to play Martha. They convincingly play their roles as Clark's earthbound parental role models.Henry Cavill was a great casting choice. He certainly looks the part and, let's face it, he did as well as he could with what he had to work with. He's certainly a fine actor (The Tudors) and didn't try to be a Reeve clone (like Routh in ""Returns""). However, by saying ""what he had to work with"", it allows me to segue into what I believe the film got wrong. Before I do, I please ask that, should your opinion differ from mine, please maintain some civility in your comments. We all have opinions and these are merely my own.Christopher Nolan and David Goyer were clearly the wrong people to tell Superman's story. As I mentioned earlier in this already lengthy review, Superman and Batman are polar opposites. It would seem that they really wanted to give this film a ""realistic"" take on how the world and humanity would react to an alien presense with god-like powers. Naturally, he would be met with cynicism, fear, and distrust. While this is an intriguing premise, by doing so they have erased Superman's sense of wonder, hope, and goodwill. While we all know Superman/Kal-El is an alien, Superman is also Clark Kent. As a matter of fact, and please go back and look through the history of the character over seventy-five years, Superman is more Clark Kent than he is Kal-El. Despite his alien birth and phenomenal powers, Clark Kent is one of us. His humanity and midwestern upbringing gives him the moral fiber to use his powers responsibly. In other words, he knows when and where to pull his punches. It's not only about saving the people of Earth, it's about protecting them and striving to keep them from harms way. So...where was THIS Superman in the latter half of the film???One of the biggest complaints most had with ""Superman Returns"" was the lack of action. We all wanted to see Supes throw a punch and kick a little butt. I was certainly one of those who longed for a real global threat as opposed to yet another Lex Luthor feeble real estate scam. However, while this film certainly delivers the action many of us wanted to see, they took it to levels of mayhem and destruction that was (for lack of a better term) in poor taste. Poor taste for Superman, anyhow. As a sci-fi epic, it works. As a Superman movie, it fails on many levels. It's as if they were trying to make up for ""Returns"" lack of action by over compensating and saying ""this is not your father's Superman"". The collateral damage in this film is nearly unforgivable. There comes a point where I, as a movie buff, stop suspending disbelief and start paying attention to the staggering loss of life that has to be occurring in the midst of all the ""action"". When action gives way to absolute mayhem and wanton destruction, I find myself detached and disillusioned. I wanted to root for Superman. I wanted to root for Smallville's favorite son. I wanted to root for Clark. However, the last third of the film had me asking myself "" Why isn't he taking this fight AWAY from the already decimated Metropolis???"". My son and I often joke, being comic book fans, about how much insurance premiums must cost for the average citizen of Metropolis. As I was watching the climactic final battle, I found myself thinking of the escalating body count with each punch landed by either Superman or Zod. ""Ooops...there goes Zod through another building...that's probably two or three hundred people dead right there"", and et cetera. Have film makers become so jaded that they don't think people will notice or care? What does that say about us as a movie going public??Now, I'm taking into consideration the Kryptonian threat. Naturally, there are high stakes in this story (maybe too high because I'm not sure how they will up the ante for a sequel or subsequent films), but the failure here is that the crash-bang-wallop happens before you're genuinely in a position to care about any of these people. Superman, in this story, is more Kal-El than Clark. He's somewhat detached and unsympatheic most of the time. He's grown up in Kansas, yet seems all too eager to be more Kryptonian than Earthling. Instead of being uplifted and optimistic, as should have been my sense when watching Superman, I was unsettled and cynical after a while. All the great special effects and CGI in the world mean absolutely nothing without a solid and engaging story to tell. However, I think the greatest sin inherent in Man Of Steel is that it takes itself WAY too seriously. I can't recall a single point in the film where I laughed (save for the moment outside the bar where Clark was bullied by a drunken patron). As a matter of fact, I don't think I even smiled a whole lot either. My point is this...shouldn't we be smiling when watching Superman? Shouldn't we come out of a Superman movie longing to take to the skies and fight the good fight? That sensation was lost on me here. Granted, I wasn't as livid and angry as I was coming out of ""Superman Returns"", I simply was left feeling uninspired. A great movie has me coming out talking about it for days on end. Man Of Steel simply left me stupified. It's like watching a big fireworks display on the Fourth Of July that goes on much longer than it should. After about fifteen minutes of big bangs and spectacle, at some point you just want to go home as if to say ""enough already""... Too much of anything is not a good thing, and Man Of Steel gets to be too much after a while.Great Scott!! Superman shouldn't be THIS difficult to get right! We live in a cynical age. We don't trust our government. We don't trust our media. Sensationalism and exploitation mire the airwaves, films, books, and music. Shouldn't a Superman movie be a welcome distraction from all of this cynicsm? Again, this is my humble opinion, but shouldn't Superman be inspiring? To me, Superman should be the best of ALL of us. No matter what race, creed, or philosophical background you have, Superman should encapsulate all that strive for and not just some comic book with unrealistic powers and oversimplified morality. Is being the ""big blue boy scout"" such a bad thing???I didn't hate the movie. It was enjoyable at times and provided some ""geek out"" moments for me as a comic book fan. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good Superman movie. Yes...there is a difference between a good eye candy flick and a Superman movie. Namely....having respect and reverence for a character that has been a global beacon of good for seventy-five years.Sorry to all you Nolan, Goyer, and Snyder fans out there..but Superman deserved better than this.",3,Where is the joy???,1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,12182,"['Having', 'seen', 'film', 'nearly', 'week', 'ago', 'wanted', 'take', 'few', 'days', 'let', 'soak', 'wanted', 'be',

1561674,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B008JFUPFI,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[12, 21]","WOW! What a film, the finest film of the summer so far.  I enjoyed Man of Steel so much I really did not know where to start with my review, I had to rewrite the first paragraph a couple of times.  Should I begin with the astonishing action and effects or the characters that come alive on the screen?  Maybe I should talk first about Zack Snyder, and with his direction of Man of Steel he solidifies as one of the best modern day directors along with the likes of Christopher Nolan and David O. Russell.  I thought about first talking about the characters and how they came alive on screen giving emotional depth and impact to the film, but I have decided to first talk about my knowledge and opinion of Superman, in that way you can understand how surprising it is for me to love Man of Steel.In all honesty my attitude toward Superman and the Superman comics is one of indifference.  Clark Kent or Superman was just never a compelling character to me.  I mean come on he is essentially a god, and was so invincible that the writers of the comics had to find some kind of weakness for Superman and came up with the lame excuse of Kryptonite.  It just seemed ridiculous to me.  My only contact with Superman in the comics was with the whole Death of Superman saga when the Death of Superman storyline came out in 1992 it captivated me.  The comics were brilliantly written, and the story was emotionally compelling, but then DC writers decided to make clones or whatever of Superman, and what was even more of a middle finger to the fans was that the fans brought Superman back to life and so quickly.  It just came of as an insult to fans, and I do not understand how fans of the comics and the character could forgive that slight so easily.  Needlessly to say that turned me off to the comics.  I still watched the cartoons along with the old Christopher Reeve films and the regrettable Superman Returns.  My favorite adaptation of Superman was in the Lois & Clark television show staring Dean Kane as Clark Kent/Superman, and Teri Hatcher as Lois Lane.  It was well crafted and Kane and Hatcher had chemistry on screen, but still I was never that impressed with the character and my opinion over the years has turned to indifference until the Man of Steel.  DC comics along with the heavily underrated Zach Snyder and Christopher Nolan have created a near masterpiece in Man of Steel that pulled me into Superman's universe making me emotionally invested in Superman, and the rest of the characters creating the best film of the summer so far, and one of the best films of the year.I cannot speak on accurate the storyline is compared to the comics, so I will not discuss or try and compare the two.  The script was written by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, and together they do a superb job of creating a realistic world for Superman and what would it be like if Superman really appeared on Earth along with our reactions toward him and the reality if someone like Superman got involve in a battle in a major city like New York.  The two writers along with Snyder bring to life Krypton like I have never seen before.  I do not know if what happens in the film actually happened in the comics, and honestly I do not care if it did, because I loved the world Goyer and Nolan wrote, and that Snyder brought to life.  On Earth Clark struggles to find his place in the world where he grew up, yet is an alien to it.  Clark becomes a wanderer traveling from place to place helping people along the way, and in doing so he finds a friend and confidant in Lois Lane.  Clark is forced to make a decision about the direction of his life when General Zod appears demanding that Earth hand over Superman to him.  Does Clark keep his identity hidden because he does not know if he can trust the humans or not, or does he turn himself over to Zod even though he knows without a doubt that General Zod cannot be trusted?  The depth of the writing is as I said outstanding giving everything you could want from a terrific film.Who do DC and Snyder cast to play Superman?  It is an important question, because without the right actor for the role a Superman film will fail, and I believe you need an actor with both the acting ability along with the physical presence to play the iconic character.  Reeves did an admirable job in the role through four films while Kane lacked the acting ability to pull off the emotional depth I think the character should have, and Brandon Routh was just a plain terrible choice to play Superman.  Henry Cavill I believe was the perfect choice as he has both the physical presence and acting ability to pull off playing a god on Earth, and Cavil performance splendidly showing viewers how conflicted Clark is about whom he is where he comes from, and who he supposed to become.  Amy Adams is gives a great performance as Lois Lane the investigative journalist for the Daily Planet.  Along with having great chemistry with Cavill she shows that Lois is more than just a pretty face, and a damsel in distress.  Russell Crowe gives a memorable performance as Jor-El, Clark's biological father giving an emotional performance especially in the beginning of the film on Krypton.  Michael Shannon has already given a great performance earlier this year in Mud, that I believe he should be nominated for his role as a supporting actor.  Shannon's performance in Mud was more subdued than in the Man of Steel, but playing General Zod you should expect that.  I have read criticism of his performance in his performance as Zod, but I thought he did a wonderful job playing the flawed character.  Zod is a man whose job it to protect and ensure the survival of the people of Krypton at all costs even if it means damning his own soul in the process.  Zod I do not believe is a truly evil character, he is doing what he believes he has to do to ensure the survival of his race and Shannon does a good job displaying that especially one scene in the film when all hope is lost for him and his people.  The rest of the supporting cast does a good job.  Diane Lane does a good job as Martha Kent as does Laurence Fishburne who gives a good performance in his limited role as Perry White, and Christopher Meloni is does a decent job as Colonel Nathan Hardy.  The only casting choice I had a problem with was Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent or maybe it had to do more with the how the character was written than Costner's performance.  It just seemed like Goyer and Nolan did not know exactly what to do with the character and his relationship with Clark.For all the criticism Zach Snyder gets he is without question on of the best visual directors around, and has proven so with 300 and Watchmen.  Snyder finds a way to bring his films to life for his audience pulling them into his films like no other director can, and he does it again with the help of Warner Brothers, DC and a large budget.  The effects are breathtaking from the war on Krypton to Superman battling two other Krytonians in Smallville are mesmerizing, and I do not believe any other director could bring to life Superman like Snyder had.  His visual expertise along with the CGI bring to life the action making to real, and that what you are seeing is actually happing, and is that not the point of great CGI in that you cannot tell the difference in what is real and what is fake, or that the CGI and action is so good that the viewer does not care, and that is what you get with Man of Steel that Superman action film fans have always wanted as well as showing the devastating impact of gods fighting on Earth.I really do not understand why people bash Zach Snyder.  The man is a really good film director with an outstanding visual eye.  I am not a big fan of 300, but the film was visually wonderful.  With Watchmen Snyder beautifully brought to life one of the best comic graphic novels ever, and created one of the best comic films to date.  Here in Man of Steel he continues his journey in becoming one of the better directors in Hollywood.  With the help of Nolan and Goyer, Snyder creates a beautiful film and a memorable world of Superman that no director has done before.  The only problem with the production of the film is with the score that was done by Hans Zimmer which is surprising because I usually love his film scores, but with Man of Steel the music was a little too bombastic in tone, which I thought took away from the film.What are the critics thinking I do not know, because I loved Man of Steel.  Maybe it is because I am not a fan of the Superman comics or the character.  Who knows, but I thought the Man of Steel was an excellent film with great direction, a well-crafted screenplay, well written characters that were wonderfully performed along with simply amazing visuals and effects that make Man of Steel the best film of the summer, one of the best films of the year and a must for comic and non-comic fans alike.  I think DC has finally realized what they do to continue their longevity of the comic properties and though I am definitely not a DC fan I am surprisingly looking forward to a sequel and what DC does next with its properties.  I highly recommend Man of Steel and I do not think anyone should be disappointed with the film.",5,What if a child dreamed of becoming something other than what society had intended?

1561677,ARYPK3ZRXTGWB,B008JFUPFI,"J.N. ""Fat Loser""","[4, 9]","OMG!  Really?  Why is it so hard to make a good Superman movie?  The basic foundation already exists.  1 part Christopher Reeve, 1 part CGI special effects that are now available to make a kick butt film, a dash more action and a hotter Lois Lane and you got yourself the best Superman movie ever!  I'm puzzled why such a great property like Superman is so hard to reboot on the silver screen.  Superman Returns, ugh, enough has been said about that one.  I was pinning all my hopes on Man of Steel and was tragically disappointed.  Henry Cavill is totally buffed and the movie has alot of special effects, but everything else was missing.  Being an older film viewer, I was hoping to see the &#34;Golly Gee&#34; factor that was evident in the Christopher Reeve Superman movie.  People were amazed to see a man fly, they oohed and aahed when he swooped down and saved a cat out of a tree, they cheered when he rescued a lady falling from a building and they saluted when he vowed to fight for truth, justice and the American way.  He was tall, muscular and imposing, yet a sensitive and caring superhero.  Unfortunately, The Man of Steel is a completely different creature.  Firstly, the whole Krypton scene was just trash.  They made it WAY TOO long and complicated then it needed to be, which subtracted from more Clark Kent / Superman scenes.  All that weird Kryptonian cloning, genetic engineering, political battle scenes in Man of Steel was unnecessary.  What happened to the simple scene of the caring alien husband/ father/ scientist clinging to his loving wife, with tears and hope in their eye, as their world crumbled around them, while their son rockets to another world?  That's all you really needed, it spoke volumes.  Even the adoptive parents, the Kents, are kind of strange and stilted in this film.  It makes you yearn for Glen Ford and Phyllis Thaxter with their loving and poignant portrayal of parent's who adopt an extraterrestrial savior.  And you know what?  For all the dazzling special effect, can they just slow it down so you can watch Superman fly.  I really think some of the best scenes in a Superman movie is watching him lift off and flying around the city.  Not all the sudden bursts and blurring backgrounds that look like he's caught in a tornado.  Maybe The Man of Steel represents the kind of film people like today.  I still see in my minds eye a Superman movie with a wiser, more innocent hero, patrolling Metropolis in the air, taking time to wave at a little child looking up at him in awe.",2,Why is it so hard to make a good Superman movie?,1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,2533,"['OMG', 'Really', 'Why', 'so', 'hard', 'make', 'good', 'Superman', 'movie', 'basic', 'foundation', 'already', '1', 'part', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', '1', 'part', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'make', 'kick', 'butt', 'film', 'dash', 'more', 'action', 'hotter', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'got', 'best', 'Superman', 'movie', 'ever', ""'m"", 'puzzled', 'why', 'great', 'property', 'Superman', 'so', 'hard', 'reboot', 'silver', 'screen', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'ugh', 'enough', 'been', 'said', 'one', 'was', 'pinning', 'hopes', 'Man', 'Steel', 'was', 'tragically', 'disappointed', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'totally', 'buffed', 'movie', 'alot', 'special', 'effects', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'missing', 'Being', 'older', 'film', 'viewer', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', '34', 'Golly', 'Gee', '34', 'factor', 'was', 'evident', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'movie', 'People', 'were', 'amazed', 'see', 'man', 'fly', 'oohed', 'aahed', 'when', 'swooped', 'down', 'saved', 'cat', 'tree', 'cheered', 'when', 'rescued', 'lady', 'falling', 'building', 'saluted', 'when', 'vowed', 'fight', 'truth', 'justice', 'American', 'way', 'was', 'tall', 'muscular', 'imposing', 'yet', 'sensitive', 'caring', 'superhero', 'Unfortunately', 'Man', 'Steel', 'completely', 'different', 'creature', 'Firstly', 'whole', 'Krypton', 'scene', 'was', 'just', 'trash', 'made', 'WAY', 'TOO', 'long', 'complicated', 'then', 'needed', 'be', 'subtracted', 'more', 'Clark', 'Kent', '/', 'Superman', 'scenes', 'weird', 'Kryptonian', 'cloning', 'genetic', 'engineering', 'political', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Man', 'Steel', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'What', 'happened', 'simple', 'scene', 'caring', 'alien', 'husband/', 'father/', 'scientist', 'clinging', 'loving', 'wife', 'tears', 'hope', 'eye', 'world', 'crumbled', 'son', 'rockets', 'world', 'really', 'needed', 'spoke', 'volumes', 'Even', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'Kents', 'are', 'kind', 'strange', 'stilted', 'film', 'yearn', 'Glen', 'Ford', 'Phyllis', 'Thaxter', 'loving', 'poignant', 'portrayal', 'parent', 'who', 'adopt', 'extraterrestrial', 'savior', 'know', 'what', 'dazzling', 'special', 'effect', 'can', 'just', 'slow', 'down', 'so', 'can', 'watch', 'Superman', 'fly', 'really', 'think', 'best', 'scenes', 'Superman', 'movie', 'watching', 'lift', 'off', 'flying', 'city', 'Not', 'sudden', 'bursts', 'blurring', 'backgrounds', 'look', 'caught', 'tornado', 'Maybe', 'Man', 'Steel', 'kind', 'film', 'people', 'today', 'still', 'see', 'minds', 'eye', 'Superman', 'movie', 'wiser', 'more', 'innocent', 'hero', 'patrolling', 'Metropolis', 'air', 'taking', 'time', 'wave', 'little', 'child', 'looking', 'up', 'awe']",N/A

When he's in the suit they put entirely too much makeup on his face. This makes it feel like a daytime soap actor thrown into a major motion picture. I was not feeling Amy Adams as Lois Lane at all. Michael Shannon (Zod) has way more potential as an actor than what the writers gave to him.There is not nearly enough action sequences to save it. Some of the reviews here rave about the action and scenery. I feel like I watched a completely different movie. There's nothing new here that we haven't seen from the other franchises in recent years.I can not recommend this movie. My advice to a Superman fan would be to go rewatch Superman II.

Connor ""dragonsandsuch""","[2, 4]","This is by far the best Superman movie to date, but it does, unfortunately have some problems as well.(Likely spoilers ahead.)First, I especially liked the way the movie portrayed the Kryptonians having to adapt not only to earth's different atmosphere, but also to there new found powers. It always bothered me that every other Superman story (Superman II, Lois and Clark, Smallville) that involved Zod (or other evil Kryptonians) had them mastering their abilities as if they had them all their lives (Smallville being the worst offender, as Zod and his pals had greater mastery of their powers than even Clark had).Second, I liked how they skipped the hidden identity (at least from Lois). It has been done to death and, as most Superman fans know, the two are cannonically an item (married even) so I'm glad they did not feel the need to go back to the &#34;will she find out and when&#34; scenerio of previous incarnations. This does lead to one logic problem, though. If Lois can find out so easily, why can't anyone else?I really liked the way Jor-El was protrayed as well - as the father that inspires his son to greatness. This also leads to my biggest problem with the movie - Jonathon Kent. Worst incarnation ever. On the one hand he is telling Clark that the type of man he will become, for good or for evil, will change the world, but then he's teaching his son that it is OK for him to let a bus load of school kids die in order to maintain his secret identity. Then, later, after telling Clark he is here for some great purpose, he's angry with Clark for not wanting to be a farmer. Farmers are great and all, but it does not take superpowers to be one. That would be am obvious waste of Clark's abilities. His death was just plan lame as well. Better to have had Clark just reminising about his father at his grave and saying how he beleived that the world was not ready. Too bad he did not hear Jor-El in the beginning when Lara said &#34;He'll be an outcast. They'll kill him.&#34; The simple response was &#34;How?&#34;The next problem issue for me was the battle at the end. Drawn out and the CGI, while looking good, did not feel real. This is one area where Superman II out did this with the &#34;less is more&#34; motto. The battle felt real in Superman II. It was more video game like in MOS. (Still, I liked MOS much more than SM2).Finally, the final solution concerning Zod was very well done. I know there are a lot of viewers that don't like it, but I found it the most realistic and moral choice Superman could have made given the circumstances. Seriously, how is Superman going to subdue and detain Zod? But instead of going the easy, convenient death that the hero is not responsible for (such as Green Goblin in the Spider-Man movie), they forced Superman to make the hard choice. In the end, he made the correct (though painful) choice.",4,"Best Superman movie ever, but still not without a few problems.",1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,2869,"['far', 'best', 'Superman', 'movie', 'date', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'problems', 'well', 'Likely', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'First', 'especially', 'liked', 'way', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'Kryptonians', 'having', 'adapt', 'not', 'only', 'earth', 'different', 'atmosphere', 'also', 'new', 'found', 'powers', 'always', 'bothered', 'other', 'Superman', 'story', 'Superman', 'II', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'Smallville', 'involved', 'Zod', 'other', 'evil', 'Kryptonians', 'had', 'mastering', 'abilities', 'had', 'lives', 'Smallville', 'being', 'worst', 'offender', 'Zod', 'pals', 'had', 'greater', 'mastery', 'powers', 'even', 'Clark', 'had', '.Second', 'liked', 'how', 'skipped', 'hidden', 'identity', 'least', 'Lois', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'most', 'Superman', 'fans', 'know', 'two', 'are', 'cannonically', 'item', 'married', 'even', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'need', 'go', 'back', '34', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'when', '34', 'scenerio', 'previous', 'incarnations', 'lead', 'one', 'logic', 'problem', 'though', 'Lois', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'so', 'easily', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'else', 'really', 'liked', 'way', 'Jor-El', 'was', 'protrayed', 'as', 'well', 'father', 'son', 'greatness', 'also', 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'Jonathon', 'Kent', 'Worst', 'incarnation', 'ever', 'one', 'hand', 'telling', 'Clark', 'type', 'man', 'will', 'become', 'good', 'evil', 'will', 'change', 'world', 'then', 'teaching', 'son', 'OK', 'let', 'bus', 'load', 'school', 'kids', 'die', 'order', 'maintain', 'secret', 'identity', 'Then', 'later', 'telling', 'Clark', 'here', 'great', 'purpose', 'angry', 'Clark', 'not', 'wanting', 'be', 'farmer', 'Farmers', 'are', 'great', 'not', 'take', 'superpowers', 'be', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'am', 'obvious', 'waste', 'Clark', 'abilities', 'death', 'was', 'just', 'plan', 'lame', 'as', 'well', 'Better', 'have', 'had', 'Clark', 'just', 'reminising', 'father', 'grave', 'saying', 'how', 'beleived', 'world', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', 'not', 'hear', 'Jor-El', 'beginning', 'when', 'Lara', 'said', '34', ""'ll"", 'be', 'outcast', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'him.', '34', 'simple', 'response', 'was', '34', 'How', '34', 'next', 'problem', 'issue', 'was', 'battle', 'end', 'Drawn', 'CGI', 'looking', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'real', 'one', 'area', 'where', 'Superman', 'II', 'out', 'did', '34', 'less', 'more', '34', 'motto', 'battle', 'felt', 'real', 'Superman', 'II', 'was', 'more', 'video', 'game', 'MOS', 'Still', 'liked', 'MOS', 'much', 'more', 'SM2', '.Finally', 'final', 'solution', 'concerning', 'Zod', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'know', 'are', 'lot', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'found', 'most', 'realistic', 'moral', 'choice', 'Superman', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'given', 'circumstances', 'Seriously', 'how', 'Superman', 'going', 'subdue', 'detain', 'Zod', 'instead', 'going', 'easy', 'convenient', 'death', 'hero', 'not', 'responsible', 'such', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'Spider-Man', 'movie', 'forced', 'Superman', 'make', 'hard', 'choice', 'end', 'made', 'correct', 'painful', 'choice']",N/A

1561702,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B008JFUPFI,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[3, 11]","***This review may contain spoilers***I must admit I was a bit leery about watching ""Man of Steel"" (hereafter MoS) after hearing rumors that he would undergo some sort of dark, tortured, and psychologically probing ""Dark Knight"" makeover, or some sort of Spiderman-like brooding existential angst.  No matter how eager you are to confirm realistically Superman's importance to our modern jaded times, you really don't have a lot of dramatic wiggle room with the legendary Kryptonian.  We must face facts; for over 75 years, Superman has been as close to God as a mortal can hope to get.  How do you reintroduce Superman as a new, fresh character without fundamentally changing who he is?MoS addresses this unenviable dilemma by, yes, combining some of that Spidey existential angst with the old ""journey towards your destiny"" plot, while still maintaining and elaborately explaining the basic elements of his origin.  This time, though, the realization of his Christ-like destiny as mankind's protector and savior is more tentative, erratic, and uncertain.  Superman has all the marvelous powers we know and love, but he must learn to control, focus, and use them at the right time.  The movie's shocking depiction of young Clark's uncontrolled X-ray vision and how it compels him to hide in his school's janitor's room is a novel illustration of this.  Also, his forbearance will be interpreted as wimpiness, so he will be unwisely baited by kid and adult bullies to fight back. Clark/Kal-El (buff but endearing hunk Henry Cavill) will learn from his holographic father/mentor Jor-El (a solemn Russell Crowe) that he is the symbolic AND genetic embodiment of his race and must accept the task of not only setting an example for Earth, but also somehow regenerating Krypton.  Furthermore, he must accomplish this task without frightening the suspicious, fearful earthlings. This is indeed a heavy Herculean burden.But, was there any real doubt that Superman could bear this burden?  Besides Jor-El, he receives unexpected guidance from intrepid, globetrotting newspaper reporter Lois Lane, no longer the clueless, hopelessly reckless victim of old.  She doggedly follows Clark's odd job wanderings and convincingly pieces together who he is and cares about him as a person first (and not a love at first sight).  Of course Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) provide the down-to-earth grounding and patient nurturing that Clark needs as an emotional anchor.  MoS shows that Superman will need that guidance when the wild-eyed maniacal Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his troops accidentally burst free from the Phantom Zone due to Krypton's explosion, and make a beeline towards Earth as a platform for his own ruthless resuscitation of the old homeworld.  There's nothing like a planetary threat to help a superhuman decide what he wants to do with his life.Of course, this will involve epic, world-shattering clashes that would make the Transformers rust with envy.  But once the dust and rubble clears, the iconic, and reassuring Superman (and Clark Kent) personas emerge at last.  That is why I mainly enjoyed MoS - it respects what Superman represents and is while still exploring his thoughts, feelings, and hopes for the future, and challenging his values and morals.  This is a tricky dance, but MoS executed it well.P.S.  As other posters have logically and thoroughly documented, MoS does have its head-shaking inconsistencies and plot stumblings.  For example, we have the infamous tornado scene; Jonathan should have realized that Clark could have saved him at blurry super-speed without revealing his identity.  This could have also applied to the school bus rescue.  Jonathan's obsession with concealing Clark's true nature was also maddeningly baffling. And, of course, the destructive Superman/Zod showdown.  Superman realistically would be facing a tidal wave of civil and even criminal litigation, and the Smallville/Metropolis populace would be outraged and want these aliens gone. Finally, Superman's deadly resolution of the Zod problem was most likely unnecessary.  There were numerous other ways to end the threat before resorting to that uncharacteristic act.  Nonetheless, MoS is both thoughtful, introspective, and just plain rousing, slam-bang entertainment that rates a 4.5",4,"The More You Try to Reimagine Superman, The More He Remains Gloriously True to Himself",1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,4334,"['***This', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers***I', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'bit', 'leery', 'watching', 'Man', 'Steel', 'hereafter', 'MoS', 'hearing', 'rumors', 'would', 'undergo', 'sort', 'dark', 'tortured', 'psychologically', 'probing', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'makeover', 'sort', 'Spiderman-like', 'brooding', 'existential', 'angst', 'matter', 'how', 'eager', 'are', 'confirm', 'realistically', 'Superman', 'importance', 'modern', 'jaded', 'times', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'wiggle', 'room', 'legendary', 'Kryptonian', 'must', 'face', 'facts', '75', 'years', 'Superman', 'been', 'close', 'God', 'mortal', 'can', 'hope', 'get', 'How', 'do', 'reintroduce', 'Superman', 'new', 'fresh', 'character', 'fundamentally', 'changing', 'who', 'MoS', 'unenviable', 'dilemma', 'yes', 'combining', 'Spidey', 'existential', 'angst', 'old', 'journey', 'towards', 'destiny', 'plot', 'still', 'maintaining', 'elaborately', 'explaining', 'basic', 'elements', 'origin', 'time', 'though', 'realization', 'Christ-like', 'destiny', 'mankind', 'protector', 'savior', 'more', 'tentative', 'erratic', 'uncertain', 'Superman', 'marvelous', 'powers', 'know', 'love', 'must', 'learn', 'control', 'focus', 'use', 'right', 'time', 'movie', 'shocking', 'depiction', 'young', 'Clark', 'uncontrolled', 'X-ray', 'vision', 'how', 'hide', 'school', 'janitor', 'room', 'novel', 'illustration', 'Also', 'forbearance', 'will', 'be', 'interpreted', 'wimpiness', 'will', 'be', 'unwisely', 'baited', 'kid', 'adult', 'bullies', 'fight', 'back', 'Clark/Kal-El', 'buff', 'endearing', 'hunk', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'will', 'learn', 'holographic', 'father/mentor', 'Jor-El', 'solemn', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'symbolic', 'AND', 'genetic', 'embodiment', 'race', 'must', 'accept', 'task', 'not', 'only', 'setting', 'example', 'Earth', 'also', 'somehow', 'regenerating', 'Krypton', 'Furthermore', 'must', 'accomplish', 'task', 'frightening', 'suspicious', 'fearful', 'earthlings', 'indeed', 'heavy', 'Herculean', 'burden.But', 'was', 'there', 'real', 'doubt', 'Superman', 'could', 'bear', 'burden', 'Jor-El', 'unexpected', 'guidance', 'intrepid', 'globetrotting', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'no', 'longer', 'clueless', 'hopelessly', 'reckless', 'victim', 'old', 'doggedly', 'Clark', 'odd', 'job', 'wanderings', 'convincingly', 'pieces', 'together', 'who', 'cares', 'about', 'person', 'first', 'not', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'course', 'Jonathan', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'provide', 'down-to-earth', 'grounding', 'patient', 'nurturing', 'Clark', 'emotional', 'anchor', 'MoS', 'Superman', 'will', 'need', 'guidance', 'when', 'wild-eyed', 'maniacal', 'Kryptonian', 'General', 'Zod', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'troops', 'accidentally', 'burst', 'free', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'due', 'Krypton', 'explosion', 'make', 'beeline', 'towards', 'Earth', 'platform', 'own', 'ruthless', 'resuscitation', 'old', 'homeworld', 'nothing', 'planetary', 'threat', 'help', 'superhuman', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'life.Of', 'course', 'will', 'involve', 'epic', 'world-shattering', 'clashes', 'would', 'make', 'Transformers', 'rust', 'envy', 'once', 'dust', 'rubble', 'clears', 'iconic', 'reassuring', 'Superman', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'personas', 'emerge', 'last', 'why', 'mainly', 'enjoyed', 'MoS', 'what', 'Superman', 'still', 'exploring', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'future', 'challenging', 'values', 'morals', 'tricky', 'dance', 'MoS', 'executed', 'other', 'posters', 'have', 'logically', 'thoroughly', 'documented', 'MoS', 'have', 'head-shaking', 'inconsistencies', 'plot', 'stumblings', 'example', 'have', 'infamous', 'tornado', 'scene', 'Jonathan', 'should', 'have', 'realized', 'Clark', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'blurry', 'super-speed', 'revealing', 'identity', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'applied', 'school', 'bus', 'rescue', 'Jonathan', 'obsession', 'concealing', 'Clark', 'true', 'nature', 'was', 'also', 'maddeningly', 'baffling', 'course', 'destructive', 'Superman/Zod', 'showdown', 'Superman', 'realistically', 'would', 'be', 'facing', 'tidal', 'wave', 'civil', 'even', 'criminal', 'litigation', 'Smallville/Metropolis', 'populace', 'would', 'be', 'outraged', 'want', 'aliens', 'gone', 'Finally', 'Superman', 'deadly', 'resolution', 'Zod', 'problem', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'unnecessary', 'were', 'numerous', 'other', 'ways', 'end', 'threat', 'resorting', 'uncharacteristic', 'act', 'Nonetheless', 'MoS', 'thoughtful', 'introspective', 'just', 'plain', 'rousing', 'slam-bang', 'entertainment', 'rates', '4.5']",N/A

I was never a fan of Superman, he just never appealed to me. When I went to The Dark Knight Rises midnight screening, the first trailer that played was the Man of Steel teaser trailer. I said to myself, &#34;I need to go see this when it comes out.&#34; I did, and I was greatly satisfied. The only real complaint I have with the film is that it takes itself WAY too seriously. Snyder and David Goyer could've thrown in some more humor into the film. Not the best superhero movie, but certainly not the worst out there. Also, the bonus features are fantastic. The features go into the action of the movie, some of the main casts workout sessions, Hans Zimmers experience on making the film's score, and watching the movie and learning how the film was created simultaneously. If you had to pick between the Blu Ray case or steelbook, get the steelbook. The regular Blu Ray case stack the discs on each other.

Two important roles, for example, Jor-El and Pa Kent might as well have been played by anyone while a lesser known actor, Shannon, steals the show as Zod. Adams and Cavill have zero chemistry here, leading you to wonder just how easy it is to get a job casting movies in Hollywood. Then there's the matter of the movie's pace; it takes an hour to get around to seeing Supes in uniform? Well, that could have worked had Clark Kent been given something to do leading up to his transformation instead of bumbling around the country giving long dramatic stares. Is there any action in this movie? Certainly; too much in fact. I say that because just punching each other around for 45 minutes kinda gets old at some point. And that's where Synder's vision of Supes fails - too much brawn and none of the brains that Reeves' Superman displayed. I still gave the movie two stars for Zod's portrayal and the swerve Supes takes in the end of this movie, but overall, this didn't blow me away. (In fact, Supes never uses that power in this movie.

1561707,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B008JFUPFI,Joker,"[1, 3]","For a description of the plot, etc., read some of the other 660+ reviews.  I just want to give a drive-thru evaluation of this movie...Man Of Steel (2013) is another reboot of the Superman franchise.  We had the Christopher Reeve movies, then Superman Returns in 2006.  I like the first two Reeve movies and I also like Superman Returns.  When it comes to Superman in general, I have a mild interest at best.  I'm a way bigger fan of Batman than I am of Superman.  Batman is mortal, so that's what's appealing right off the bat, not to mention the villains Batman faces are very interesting.  In contrast, Superman is immortal, so that changes the whole ballgame.  Anyway, about Man Of Steel...This movie's title is an indication that there have been an excessive number of Superman movies made over the years, so change was in order.  This movie has a ton of action in it.  Special effects of the CGI variety are used to the maximum.  Even with all the advances in computer generated images, it still looks too cartoonish and computerized, and this movie has a tremendous amount of it.  Way too much.  I think the action sequences are good, but I was distracted by the fact that there was too much action all while looking cartoonish.  When action sequences are used more sparingly, I can accept the cartoonish CGI much more easily, but the fact that there was way too much was a distraction.  A lot of the fighting that took place between Superman and his enemy was way over the top and some of it looked ridiculous.  I also think the story and plot suffered quite a bit due to the &#34;let's wow the audience with our special effects&#34; mentality of the makers of this film.  I did feel that the story was a little thin in favor of a special effects extravaganza.  Another thing I noticed is that this movie is darker in tone than other Superman movies, almost taking itself too seriously.  However, all of this aside, I did find the movie entertaining.  This Superman had a cool costume, maybe the best one ever.  The acting was pretty good.  Lois Lane was good.  Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe did well.  I found the movie entertaining because that's all I expect from a Superman movie (the good ones, anyway).  I expect to see, especially in this day and age, over the top action sequences and tons of special effects in Superman movies.  So while I was being critical of these very things earlier in this review, I'm saying now that I expect this kind of stuff in Superman movies, especially the modern ones.  Superman has super powers, just like how computers nowadays have super powers.  When you have a character who has super powers and you want to make a movie about him, you need to have super powered computers to generate the special effects that are needed to portray Superman's super powers to maximum effect.  In this aspect, the makers of this movie succeeded. though I do think it was OVERDONE.  I guess what I'm saying here is that when I'm watching a Superman movie - any modern Superman movie within the last decade - I'm enjoying it, but in the back of my mind I'm thinking about how I want to watch a Batman movie right after so I can get back to seeing a mortal super hero.  In other words, get back down to earth.So, with that said, I do recommend seeing Man Of Steel.",4,"I saw it for pennies.

The Film of course is about Clark becoming Superman but he isn't Superman just yet. One of the reasons he's not called Superman in the film or any where on the title of the movie is because he's not Superman just yet. So for respect of the movie, I'll just call him Super Clark. Well Super Clark makes a lot of mistakes, things he WON&#34;T make in the future, when he finally becomes the Superman. However, this movie made it clear that this was the beginning of his journey. One of the best flashbacks I have seen in a movie, allowed the film to progress very quickly and get to the real meat of the film, which was his Kryptionian brothers trying to obtain him, as Super Clark is a bit more essential and special when compared to his people. (Don't wont to spoil It) Anyways, once the Kryptionians come to get him, EPIC fight scenes occur and for the first time in live action, we get to see what a true Superhero can do. When I went to the theaters and saw this movie, I was purely wowed and if you give this movie a shot, you will too.

1561712,AHR9GFUXXEHY0,B008JFUPFI,Jon Thompson,"[6, 9]","I would honestly have to say I found this latest reboot of the iconic character to be just a bit disturbing. Certainly the visual and special effects were stunning, and there is plenty of action. The acting is fine, considering the story being told, and I even admired the attempt to make the entire saga more realistic.And perhaps that is the problem. Because Superman isn't supposed to be 'real'. Superman is a modern myth, like that of Zeus or Hercules or Mars, all rolled into one. It is only possible in a fantasy world because it is basically a morality tale. And the thing about morality tales is they can't have moral shades of grey. They are intended to clearly show what is right and what is wrong, and display the rewards and punishments of choosing either.But here the story is trying very hard to be 'real', and that makes it somewhat disturbing. For example, considering the amount of carnage and destruction wrought in high population areas throughout the film, it is impossible to escape the looming sense that quite a number of innocent bystanders are being slaughtered. We may not see bodies flying through the air in pieces, but when a skyscraper explodes in a ball of fire, it's difficult to accept that there was no one inside at the time.What makes that realization unsettling is the fact that Superman more or less chooses that as the battleground. As he was the focus of the aggression, being persued by Zod, he could just as easily have lured the enemies to the Gobi desert and had it out there. Instead he blows up his home town and half of Metropolis. Not what you would consider Superman behavior.And it's also difficult to reconcile the Superpowers which clearly toss all physics out the window, with a world with unbreakable physical limitations. And exactly what can and can't hurt these aliens? You can literally hit them with an entire building... repeatedly... and they don't sustain so much as a scratch. But you can snap their necks easily enough. Huh?The other thing that just felt awkward and wrong was the not so subtle attempt to equate Superman to Jesus Christ. Granted, that is implied in the overall mythos of the character, as it is in all myths, but here they kind of poke you in the face with it. Superman is 33 years old. Hmmm. He's going to change the world. Hmmm. He has a heavenly (albeit computer stored) father. Big hmmm. And when that father sends him to Earth (from the spaceship Lois Lane has just been ejected from in an escape pod), he reminds his son he can save them all. Is it necessary for Superman to float out into space in a perfect crucifiction pose?So I suppose that in attempting to make this culturally iconic character more 'real', they simply exposed parts of him that are a little disturbing to consider. This is a film where it would not have been out of place to show Superman coming out of the bathroom with a newspaper in his hand to the sound of a flushing toilet.That's a bit too much reality for my taste.",3,"The ""S"" means what, now?",1386288000,"12 6, 2013",2013,2983,"['would', 'honestly', 'have', 'say', 'found', 'latest', 'reboot', 'iconic', 'character', 'be', 'just', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'Certainly', 'visual', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'stunning', 'plenty', 'action', 'acting', 'fine', 'considering', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'even', 'admired', 'attempt', 'make', 'entire', 'saga', 'more', 'realistic.And', 'perhaps', 'problem', 'Superman', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', ""'real"", 'Superman', 'modern', 'myth', 'Zeus', 'Hercules', 'Mars', 'rolled', 'one', 'only', 'possible', 'fantasy', 'world', 'basically', 'morality', 'tale', 'thing', 'morality', 'tales', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'moral', 'shades', 'grey', 'are', 'intended', 'clearly', 'show', 'what', 'right', 'what', 'wrong', 'display', 'rewards', 'punishments', 'choosing', 'either.But', 'here', 'story', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'be', ""'real"", 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'example', 'considering', 'amount', 'carnage', 'destruction', 'wrought', 'high', 'population', 'areas', 'film', 'impossible', 'escape', 'looming', 'sense', 'number', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'are', 'being', 'slaughtered', 'may', 'not', 'see', 'bodies', 'flying', 'air', 'pieces', 'when', 'skyscraper', 'ball', 'fire', 'difficult', 'accept', 'was', 'one', 'inside', 'time.What', 'realization', 'unsettling', 'fact', 'Superman', 'more', 'less', 'chooses', 'battleground', 'was', 'focus', 'aggression', 'being', 'persued', 'Zod', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'have', 'lured', 'enemies', 'Gobi', 'desert', 'had', 'out', 'there', 'Instead', 'up', 'home', 'town', 'half', 'Metropolis', 'Not', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'Superman', 'behavior.And', 'also', 'difficult', 'reconcile', 'Superpowers', 'clearly', 'toss', 'physics', 'out', 'window', 'world', 'unbreakable', 'physical', 'limitations', 'exactly', 'what', 'can', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'aliens', 'can', 'literally', 'hit', 'entire', 'building', 'repeatedly', 'do', ""n't"", 'sustain', 'so', 'much', 'scratch', 'can', 'snap', 'necks', 'easily', 'enough', 'Huh', 'other', 'thing', 'just', 'felt', 'awkward', 'wrong', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'attempt', 'equate', 'Superman', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'Granted', 'implied', 'overall', 'mythos', 'character', 'myths', 'here', 'kind', 'poke', 'face', 'Superman', '33', 'years', 'old', 'Hmmm', 'going', 'change', 'world', 'Hmmm', 'heavenly', 'computer', 'stored', 'father', 'Big', 'hmmm', 'when', 'father', 'Earth', 'spaceship', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'just', 'been', 'ejected', 'escape', 'pod', 'son', 'can', 'save', 'necessary', 'Superman', 'float', 'out', 'space', 'perfect', 'crucifiction', 'pose', 'So', 'suppose', 'attempting', 'make', 'culturally', 'iconic', 'character', 'more', ""'real"", 'simply', 'exposed', 'parts', 'are', 'little', 'disturbing', 'consider', 'film', 'where', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'place', 'show', 'Superman', 'coming', 'out', 'bathroom', 'newspaper', 'hand', 'sound', 'flushing', 'toilet.That', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'reality', 'taste']",N/A

If you like big spectacle movies, with lots of action and special effects, than this movie will be right up your alley.  If you are even a peripheral Superman fan (i.e. saw the old movies when you were a kid, and read a few of the comics and watch the animated TV shows and movies) then this movie is a little harder to love.  It just doesn't really get into what makes Superman the iconic character that we all know and like/love.  It is the 1st movie in obviously and ongoing story/universe, so there is still time for them to address a lot of those issues as the stories progress.

1561715,A3AVNX9RHHNSLD,B008JFUPFI,Jorge A. Lacayo,"[5, 14]","The worst Superman movie since 1987's Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Man of Steel follows Henry Cavill's Clark Kent as he struggles to find his place in a world that's not his own - with the character's existential musings interrupted by the arrival of a vicious Kryptonian warlord (Michael Shannon's Zod) bent on world domination. There's little doubt that Man of Steel gets off to a less-than-promising start, as filmmaker Zack Snyder, working from David S. Goyer's screenplay, opens the movie with a tedious stretch set on Superman's dying home planet of Krypton - with the overuse of computer-generated effects lending such scenes a derivative and surprisingly campy feel (ie if Avatar had been incompetent and terrible, it might've resembled this). The movie does, however, improve considerably once the action shifts to Earth, with the time-shifting script ensuring that the emphasis on the central character's early days rarely fares as poorly as one might've feared (ie Snyder and Goyer wisely skip over some of the more familiar aspects of Clark/Superman's origin story). Man of Steel's completely watchable atmosphere is heightened by its proliferation of impressive performances, with Cavill's strong work as the title figure matched by a supporting cast that includes, among others, Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, and Kevin Costner. (The latter's engrossing turn as Clark's adoptive father stands as an obvious highlight within the proceedings.) It's only as Zod (re)enters the picture that one's interest begins to slowly-but-surely dip, as the film's final hour is devoted entirely to the epic battle between Zod and Superman - with the ineffectiveness of this stretch (ie it's like watching someone else play a poorly-rendered video game) compounded by Snyder's inept directorial choices (ie the shaky camerawork renders the majority of this stuff incoherent). The endless third act ultimately transforms Man of Steel into a disappointing (and surprisingly second-rate) piece of work, with the movie's lack of magic or wonder standing in sharp contrast to the previous portrayals of this iconic character (ie Bryan Singer's Superman Returns is looking positively masterful by comparison).",1,"Worst than ""Superman Returns""",1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,2206,"['worst', 'Superman', 'movie', '1987', 'Superman', 'IV', 'Quest', 'Peace', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'find', 'place', 'world', 'not', 'own', 'character', 'existential', 'musings', 'interrupted', 'arrival', 'vicious', 'Kryptonian', 'warlord', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'Zod', 'bent', 'world', 'domination', 'little', 'doubt', 'Man', 'Steel', 'off', 'less-than-promising', 'start', 'filmmaker', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'working', 'David', 'S.', 'Goyer', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'tedious', 'stretch', 'set', 'Superman', 'dying', 'home', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'overuse', 'computer-generated', 'effects', 'lending', 'such', 'scenes', 'derivative', 'surprisingly', 'campy', 'feel', 'ie', 'Avatar', 'had', 'been', 'incompetent', 'terrible', 'might', ""'ve"", 'resembled', 'movie', 'however', 'improve', 'considerably', 'once', 'action', 'shifts', 'Earth', 'time-shifting', 'script', 'ensuring', 'emphasis', 'central', 'character', 'early', 'days', 'rarely', 'as', 'poorly', 'one', 'might', ""'ve"", 'feared', 'ie', 'Snyder', 'Goyer', 'wisely', 'skip', 'more', 'familiar', 'aspects', 'Clark/Superman', 'origin', 'story', 'Man', 'Steel', 'completely', 'watchable', 'atmosphere', 'heightened', 'proliferation', 'impressive', 'performances', 'Cavill', 'strong', 'work', 'title', 'figure', 'matched', 'supporting', 'cast', 'others', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'latter', 'engrossing', 'turn', 'Clark', 'adoptive', 'father', 'obvious', 'highlight', 'proceedings', 'only', 'Zod', 're', 'picture', 'one', 'interest', 'slowly-but-surely', 'dip', 'film', 'final', 'hour', 'devoted', 'entirely', 'epic', 'battle', 'Zod', 'Superman', 'ineffectiveness', 'stretch', 'watching', 'someone', 'else', 'play', 'poorly-rendered', 'video', 'game', 'compounded', 'Snyder', 'inept', 'directorial', 'choices', 'ie', 'shaky', 'camerawork', 'renders', 'majority', 'stuff', 'incoherent', 'endless', 'third', 'act', 'ultimately', 'transforms', 'Man', 'Steel', 'disappointing', 'surprisingly', 'second-rate', 'piece', 'work', 'movie', 'lack', 'magic', 'wonder', 'standing', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'previous', 'portrayals', 'iconic', 'character', 'ie', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'looking', 'positively', 'masterful', 'comparison']",N/A
1561716,AS49OK4MP42D0,B008JFUPFI,Jose Concepcion,"[4, 7]","I got the Man of Steel Collector's Edition combo pack, number 17,444 out of 50,000. Obviously I didn't buy it here. Got it directly from Warner Brothers online shop. Anyways it comes with what you see in the pictures. It's great to have on display(comes with a stand). UltraViolet makes it convenient to watch the movie online rather than using the physical discs. Still the discs are convenient for when you don't have internet. Then there's the special features disc, where you can see the making of the film and how much work they have put into making this movie such as the CGI that they use to create Krypton entirely or how they put together the Superman versus Zod fight, or how the actors were so great at what they do in certain scenes, such as the part of where that one trucker was being a bully to Clark Kent or how young Clark was sensing everything and ran to the Janitors closet. I am very satisfied with this. As for the movie itself, I will do sections of what I think of it.The Story -Lots of action, it never gets boring. Unlike Superman Returns where it was slow and dull. Man Of Steel gets right into action where you see Jor-El fight off Zod's forces sometime after Superman's birth, that's how fast the action starts. There's some flash backs to Superman's childhood, I was able to relate to him because of those flash backs, due to him getting bullied and feeling like an outcast, I went through the same thing in my childhood. The action is exactly like the comics, because there is a lot of destruction of Metropolis. Just go read Action Comics #700 for proof of that. Anyways the fight scene between Superman and Zod was excellent, it was like a live action Dragonball Z fight. The part were Superman snaps Zod's neck got a lot of criticism, but did they not read any of the comics? Did they missed out on what Superman did to Zod in Superman 2? Superman kills Zod. There is no other way to stop him. Hell he even kills Nuclear Man in Superman 4. Anyways over all the story was great and epic.The Music -Hans Zimmer does a fantastic job of scoring this film. It's one of the main reasons I love this film, it was a very epic and poetic score. What else is there to be said?  It's the same guy that scored The Dark Knight trilogy.Content -When you get the Man Of Steel Collector's Edition, it comes with four discs and a code for the digital copy. The special features gives you many details about what happens behind the scenes when creating this movie. It also gives you a closer look at Planet Krypton and how much work they put into every last detail, including the language. I have yet to see the 3D version of the film, but since I don't have a 3D HDTV, it will have to wait. I have not used the Blu-Ray version of the film since I got my digital copy that I can view instead. I did however use the DVD version when I went to my brothers house, since they don't have internet, however one of them took the PS3 controller with him, making it impossible to see this movie on Blu-Ray without it. So I had to use the DVD version on the Xbox 360. Which solves everything as we eat pizza and enjoyed the movie. The casing that houses the discs folds out. The steel case looks nice when it's on the stand when being displayed. The magnets on the stand keeps that S-shield in place.Overall -There is less than 50,000 of these available. So buy it when you have a chance, because once it's gone, the value of this will go up just like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collectors edition party wagon of the 1987 cartoon series. Should have paid $99.99 for it when I had the chance, now it sells for $400 on ebay ridiculously.  It is highly recommended for hardcore Superman fans out there, so grab it while you can.",5,Best Superman movie ever.,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,3737,"['got', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'combo', 'pack', 'number', '17,444', '50,000', 'Obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'here', 'Got', 'directly', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'online', 'shop', 'what', 'see', 'pictures', 'great', 'have', 'display', 'stand', 'UltraViolet', 'convenient', 'watch', 'movie', 'online', 'rather', 'using', 'physical', 'discs', 'Still', 'discs', 'are', 'convenient', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'internet', 'Then', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'making', 'film', 'how', 'much', 'work', 'have', 'put', 'making', 'movie', 'such', 'CGI', 'use', 'create', 'Krypton', 'entirely', 'how', 'put', 'together', 'Superman', 'versus', 'Zod', 'fight', 'how', 'actors', 'were', 'so', 'great', 'what', 'do', 'certain', 'scenes', 'such', 'part', 'where', 'one', 'trucker', 'was', 'being', 'bully', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'how', 'young', 'Clark', 'was', 'sensing', 'everything', 'ran', 'Janitors', 'closet', 'am', 'very', 'satisfied', 'movie', 'will', 'do', 'sections', 'what', 'think', 'it.The', 'Story', '-Lots', 'action', 'never', 'boring', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'where', 'was', 'slow', 'dull', 'Man', 'Steel', 'right', 'action', 'where', 'see', 'Jor-El', 'fight', 'Zod', 'forces', 'sometime', 'Superman', 'birth', 'how', 'fast', 'action', 'flash', 'backs', 'Superman', 'childhood', 'was', 'able', 'relate', 'flash', 'backs', 'due', 'getting', 'bullied', 'feeling', 'outcast', 'went', 'same', 'thing', 'childhood', 'action', 'exactly', 'comics', 'lot', 'destruction', 'Metropolis', 'Just', 'go', 'read', 'Action', 'Comics', '700', 'proof', 'fight', 'scene', 'Superman', 'Zod', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'live', 'action', 'Dragonball', 'Z', 'fight', 'part', 'were', 'Superman', 'Zod', 'neck', 'got', 'lot', 'criticism', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'comics', 'Did', 'missed', 'out', 'what', 'Superman', 'did', 'Zod', 'Superman', '2', 'Superman', 'Zod', 'other', 'way', 'stop', 'Hell', 'even', 'Nuclear', 'Man', 'Superman', '4', 'Anyways', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'epic.The', 'Music', '-Hans', 'Zimmer', 'fantastic', 'job', 'scoring', 'film', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'love', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'epic', 'poetic', 'score', 'What', 'else', 'be', 'said', 'same', 'guy', 'scored', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'trilogy.Content', '-When', 'get', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'four', 'discs', 'code', 'digital', 'copy', 'special', 'features', 'many', 'details', 'what', 'scenes', 'when', 'creating', 'movie', 'also', 'closer', 'look', 'Planet', 'Krypton', 'how', 'much', 'work', 'put', 'last', 'detail', 'including', 'language', 'have', 'yet', 'see', '3D', 'version', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', '3D', 'HDTV', 'will', 'have', 'wait', 'have', 'not', 'used', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'film', 'got', 'digital', 'copy', 'can', 'view', 'instead', 'did', 'however', 'use', 'DVD', 'version', 'when', 'went', 'brothers', 'house', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'internet', 'however', 'one', 'took', 'PS3', 'controller', 'making', 'impossible', 'see', 'movie', 'Blu-Ray', 'had', 'use', 'DVD', 'version', 'Xbox', '360', 'Which', 'everything', 'eat', 'pizza', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'casing', 'houses', 'discs', 'out', 'steel', 'case', 'nice', 'when', 'stand', 'when', 'being', 'displayed', 'magnets', 'stand', 'S-shield', 'place.Overall', 'less', '50,000', 'available', 'So', 'buy', 'when', 'have', 'chance', 'gone', 'value', 'will', 'go', 'up', 'just', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'collectors', 'edition', 'party', 'wagon', '1987', 'cartoon', 'series', 'Should', 'have', 'paid', '99.99', 'when', 'had', 'chance', 'now', '400', 'ebay', 'ridiculously', 'highly', 'recommended', 'hardcore', 'Superman', 'out', 'there', 'grab', 'can']",N/A

1561719,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B008JFUPFI,Joseph M. Reninger,"[1, 4]","I watched this movie with medium to low expectations. Critics weren't too impressed with it; only one person I know raved about it. It sure looked like another clunky Superman film. Many complained about the modern revision of Superman.We've seen these characters before, but they are all given some different twists. Clark Kent/Superman is interesting in that there is no big contrast between the two. Clark spends the first half of the movie in hiding and not knowing about his Kryptonian origins. He's a drifter with no life of his own--he'll work a job until something happen that causes him to use his powers. Then he moves on so people won't know what powers he has. Even after he gets his background story and his suit, he has almost no&#34;Clark Kent&#34; life. The &#34;mild mannered reporter&#34; is set up at the end of the film, so maybe in the future they will explore that duality. For this movie, he's a bit of a lost soul who finds his place on Earth.Lois Lane is a lot smarter than in previous movies, though she does fill in the &#34;damsel in distress&#34; role. Jonathan Kent is less noble than in previous stories--he tells Clark it might be okay to let people die rather than reveal his secret (right after Clark saves a bus full of his fellow school students!). You can see how this Clark winds up drifting without a true sense of purpose or identity. General Zod is less colorful and over-the-top than Superman II's Terence Stamp, though that degradation seems driven by the &#34;Krypton as Plato's Republic&#34; theme running through the film, which no one comments on.Several characters talk about Krypton's fall. One component of it is the genetically-engineered population. Zod explains how he was made to be a soldier and that's what he's done all his life, so Superman can't possibly beat him in a fight. Superman's Kryptonian parents decide to have a child naturally so that he will be free to do what he wants rather than be put in a distinct class all his life. Plato's Republic has a similar scheme--children are taken from their parents and raised in one of three classes to serve the state. The movie criticizes this on the grounds of personal freedom, which is interesting if not fully satisfactory.Another component is the exploitation of resources, including Krypton's planetary core, which provided power but becomes unstable and soon explodes. The Kryptonians had tried to colonize other planets by terraforming them but were unsuccessful. Terraforming the Earth is Zod's plan to continue the Kryptonian race, even if that means killing all the humans. Superman decides to stop it since &#34;Krypton had its chance.&#34;The movie does end with a big fight between Zod and Superman which goes on long enough for viewers to get the idea that they will never really hurt each other no matter how many buildings they plow through. And then it goes on longer. The very end of the fight is a bit contrived but at least it ends things in a sensible way. It's a common problem with superhero movies that they end with a big battle that is more numbing than exciting.The ending of the movie also injects some much needed humor. This movie could have used a little more levity sprinkled throughout. Even so, Man of Steel surprised me with how good it was. Though it gives a more somber Superman (the bad side of the modern revision), it vastly exceeds Superman III and IV and the failed reboot Superman Returns in writing quality.",3,A bit all over the place but good,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,3461,"['watched', 'movie', 'medium', 'low', 'expectations', 'Critics', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'impressed', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'know', 'raved', 'sure', 'looked', 'clunky', 'Superman', 'film', 'Many', 'complained', 'modern', 'revision', 'Superman.We', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'different', 'twists', 'Clark', 'Kent/Superman', 'interesting', 'big', 'contrast', 'two', 'Clark', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'hiding', 'not', 'knowing', 'Kryptonian', 'origins', 'drifter', 'life', 'own', ""'ll"", 'work', 'job', 'something', 'happen', 'use', 'powers', 'Then', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'powers', 'Even', 'background', 'story', 'suit', 'almost', '34', 'Clark', 'Kent', '34', 'life', '34', 'mild', 'mannered', 'reporter', '34', 'set', 'up', 'end', 'film', 'so', 'maybe', 'future', 'will', 'explore', 'duality', 'movie', 'bit', 'lost', 'soul', 'who', 'place', 'Earth.Lois', 'Lane', 'lot', 'smarter', 'previous', 'movies', 'fill', '34', 'damsel', 'distress', '34', 'role', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'less', 'noble', 'previous', 'stories', 'Clark', 'might', 'be', 'okay', 'let', 'people', 'die', 'rather', 'reveal', 'secret', 'right', 'Clark', 'bus', 'full', 'fellow', 'school', 'students', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'Clark', 'up', 'drifting', 'true', 'sense', 'purpose', 'identity', 'General', 'Zod', 'less', 'colorful', 'over-the-top', 'Superman', 'II', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'degradation', 'driven', '34', 'Krypton', 'Plato', 'Republic', '34', 'theme', 'running', 'film', 'one', 'comments', 'on.Several', 'characters', 'talk', 'Krypton', 'fall', 'One', 'component', 'genetically-engineered', 'population', 'Zod', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'soldier', 'what', 'done', 'life', 'Superman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'beat', 'fight', 'Superman', 'Kryptonian', 'parents', 'decide', 'have', 'child', 'naturally', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'free', 'do', 'what', 'rather', 'be', 'put', 'distinct', 'class', 'life', 'Plato', 'Republic', 'similar', 'scheme', 'children', 'are', 'taken', 'parents', 'raised', 'one', 'three', 'classes', 'serve', 'state', 'movie', 'grounds', 'personal', 'freedom', 'interesting', 'not', 'fully', 'satisfactory.Another', 'component', 'exploitation', 'resources', 'including', 'Krypton', 'planetary', 'core', 'provided', 'power', 'unstable', 'soon', 'explodes', 'Kryptonians', 'had', 'tried', 'colonize', 'other', 'planets', 'terraforming', 'were', 'unsuccessful', 'Terraforming', 'Earth', 'Zod', 'plan', 'continue', 'Kryptonian', 'race', 'even', 'killing', 'humans', 'Superman', 'stop', '34', 'Krypton', 'had', 'chance.', '34', 'movie', 'end', 'big', 'fight', 'Zod', 'Superman', 'long', 'enough', 'viewers', 'get', 'idea', 'will', 'never', 'really', 'hurt', 'other', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'buildings', 'plow', 'then', 'longer', 'very', 'end', 'fight', 'bit', 'contrived', 'least', 'things', 'sensible', 'way', 'common', 'problem', 'superhero', 'movies', 'end', 'big', 'battle', 'more', 'numbing', 'exciting.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'also', 'much', 'needed', 'humor', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'little', 'more', 'levity', 'sprinkled', 'Even', 'so', 'Man', 'Steel', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'more', 'somber', 'Superman', 'bad', 'side', 'modern', 'revision', 'vastly', 'Superman', 'III', 'IV', 'failed', 'reboot', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'writing', 'quality']",N/A

1561724,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B008JFUPFI,Josh,"[13, 22]","10 years ago a movie by the name of Hulk came out and I being just a young boy was ecstatic. But once I saw the movie, I was disappointed. Similarily, in 2006 a movie called Superman Returns came out; however, once I viewed it, I again found myself disappointed. Alas, came the year 2008 a movie called The Incredible Hulk was released and finally it was everything I wanted (and more) the first time.Then on June 14th, 2013 came a day like no other. A movie entitled: Man Of Steel was released and after watching it, I was emotionally/extremely satisfied.(November 17,2013 Update after blu-ray purchase)When I wrote the review for Man of Steel back in June, I was excited, and admittedly overwhelmed. I was also determined to give a perfect review; but in having those feelings, I now realize made me rush my review. And that was not my intention. After watching the blu-ray, I felt the need to re-write and give a new score and apologize for giving a rushed review. To those of you who have followed my reviews from the start, I do apologize. And for your consideration, here are my thoughts on Man of Steel.Actor Henry Cavill stars as Superman. I have seen Henry Cavill in an episode or two of The Tudors and also remember seeing him in the movie Immortals. He does possess a rather diverse, yet sensible acting ability so he is a great choice for Superman.The Story in this movie: to describe it or rather compare it to other great comic book movies: It shares common traits found in the movie Thor, but with a darker and more serious tone, combined with some elements of Batman Begins. That being said, This movie undeniably flies with style.There have been complaints made about there being TOO much action in Man of Steel; but that was one of my main issues with Superman Returns, there not being enough, if ANY action in the movie. I don't feel it was that big of an issue. One of the many good things that you will notice in Man of Steel is the music. For every punch, every scene of Superman taking flight the music that plays fits perfectly with those scenes. Zack Snyder, well what can i say. The minute I heard he would be the director of this film, I knew I would get two things: great visuals, and detailed action sequences. And you do get both in Man of Steel. And with that, we get a Superman movie that digs deep into the mythos. I was actually shocked at how deep the story is in this movie. I am also happy that Christopher Nolan had a helping hand as the producer of this movie. As a whole once the movie was over, I felt relieved. The same feeling I felt after watching the 2008 reboot The Incredible Hulk, is the same feeling I had after viewing this movie. DC has not had the best filmography as of late (except for the Nolan Batman movies), but Man of Steel is definitely an excellent way to give DC fans hope excitement/anticipation for more heroes like Aquaman, Flash, etc. to get their own movies. Man Of Steel did not exceed my expectations, but it met them by a big margin. GO SEE/BUY MAN OF STEEL.This long awaited movie gets a score of:4 StarsHenry Cavill: Clark Kent/SupermanRussell Crowe: Jor-ElKevin Costner: Jonathan KentAmy Adams: Lois LaneLaurence Fishburne: Perry WhiteMichael Shannon: General ZodDiane Lane: Martha KentChristopher Meloni: Colonel Hardy",4,"To Some he is a hero, to others he is a symbol hope",1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,3292,"['10', 'years', 'ago', 'movie', 'name', 'Hulk', 'came', 'being', 'just', 'young', 'boy', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'once', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Similarily', '2006', 'movie', 'called', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'came', 'out', 'however', 'once', 'viewed', 'again', 'found', 'disappointed', 'Alas', 'came', 'year', '2008', 'movie', 'called', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'was', 'released', 'finally', 'was', 'everything', 'wanted', 'more', 'first', 'time.Then', 'June', '14th', '2013', 'came', 'day', 'other', 'movie', 'entitled', 'Man', 'Steel', 'was', 'released', 'watching', 'was', 'emotionally/extremely', 'satisfied', 'November', '17,2013', 'Update', 'blu-ray', 'purchase', 'When', 'wrote', 'review', 'Man', 'Steel', 'back', 'June', 'was', 'excited', 'admittedly', 'overwhelmed', 'was', 'also', 'determined', 'give', 'perfect', 'review', 'having', 'feelings', 'now', 'realize', 'made', 'rush', 'review', 'was', 'not', 'intention', 'watching', 'blu-ray', 'felt', 'need', 're-write', 'give', 'new', 'score', 'apologize', 'giving', 'rushed', 'review', 'who', 'have', 'followed', 'reviews', 'start', 'do', 'apologize', 'consideration', 'here', 'are', 'thoughts', 'Man', 'Steel.Actor', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'Superman', 'have', 'seen', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'episode', 'two', 'Tudors', 'also', 'remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Immortals', 'possess', 'rather', 'diverse', 'sensible', 'acting', 'ability', 'great', 'choice', 'Superman.The', 'Story', 'movie', 'describe', 'rather', 'compare', 'other', 'great', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'shares', 'common', 'traits', 'found', 'movie', 'Thor', 'darker', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'combined', 'elements', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'undeniably', 'style.There', 'have', 'been', 'complaints', 'made', 'there', 'being', 'TOO', 'much', 'action', 'Man', 'Steel', 'was', 'one', 'main', 'issues', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'not', 'being', 'enough', 'action', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'big', 'issue', 'One', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'will', 'notice', 'Man', 'Steel', 'music', 'punch', 'scene', 'Superman', 'taking', 'flight', 'music', 'perfectly', 'scenes', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'well', 'what', 'can', 'i', 'say', 'minute', 'heard', 'would', 'be', 'director', 'film', 'knew', 'would', 'get', 'two', 'things', 'great', 'visuals', 'detailed', 'action', 'sequences', 'do', 'get', 'Man', 'Steel', 'get', 'Superman', 'movie', 'deep', 'mythos', 'was', 'actually', 'shocked', 'how', 'deep', 'story', 'movie', 'am', 'also', 'happy', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'had', 'helping', 'hand', 'producer', 'movie', 'whole', 'once', 'movie', 'was', 'felt', 'relieved', 'same', 'feeling', 'felt', 'watching', '2008', 'reboot', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'same', 'feeling', 'had', 'viewing', 'movie', 'DC', 'not', 'had', 'best', 'filmography', 'late', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'movies', 'Man', 'Steel', 'definitely', 'excellent', 'way', 'give', 'DC', 'fans', 'hope', 'excitement/anticipation', 'more', 'heroes', 'Aquaman', 'Flash', 'etc', 'get', 'own', 'movies', 'Man', 'Steel', 'did', 'not', 'exceed', 'expectations', 'met', 'big', 'margin', 'GO', 'SEE/BUY', 'MAN', 'STEEL.This', 'long', 'awaited', 'movie', 'score', 'of:4', 'StarsHenry', 'Cavill', 'Clark', 'Kent/SupermanRussell', 'Crowe', 'Jor-ElKevin', 'Costner', 'Jonathan', 'KentAmy', 'Adams', 'Lois', 'LaneLaurence', 'Fishburne', 'Perry', 'WhiteMichael', 'Shannon', 'General', 'ZodDiane', 'Lane', 'Martha', 'KentChristopher', 'Meloni', 'Colonel', 'Hardy']",N/A

1561729,A146W4L7BDSL8V,B008JFUPFI,J. Pizzuto,"[2, 5]","Superman is a difficult icon to bring to the big screen.  That's sort of counter intuitive, since the Man of Steel is the premiere action superhero.  However, there are several hurdles that the screenwriter needed to clear, and I believe that, for the most part, he succeeded:1.)  Which Superman? (popular media) - Everyone has their own idea of who Superman is.  In addition to the comic books, he has a long history on television, in movies, and in other merchandise and media.  Everyone can agree that he is iconic, but how is that American iconism supposed to be conveyed?  Should he be a boy scout?  Should he hearken back to the sort of gee-gosh moralism and simplicity from which he emerged in the WWII era?  David S. Goyer manages to avoid all of the hokiness and goes for a modern appeal.  (Pa Kent dies in 1997 when Clark is a teenager, so he likely arrived in Kansas in the 1980s and came to adulthood in the the 2010s.)  He is charming, but not in an outdated sort of way.  He also isn't a comedic figure as Clark Kent, as he increasingly became in the 1970s-era Superman movies.  As for his supporting cast, there is no sign of Lex Luthor or Jimmy Olsen, although we do see some lesser know characters (popularized for a wider audience in the Smallville television series) in Lana Lang and Pete Ross.2.)  Which Superman? (comics) - He is undoubtedly a post-Crisis Man of Steel.  Goyer could have went for a Morrison-esque, All-Star Superman vibe, but he wisely goes for a less flamboyant Superman.  He isn't super-intelligent, and his powers are well defined, even though they are never spelled out in the movie.  This is a huge positive.  The viewing audience learns about Clark's powers experientially as they develop.  The only modern iteration of his powers we fail to see is his super-breath, which I don't recall him using.  It was also interesting to see which iteration of Krypton Goyer used.  Of course, he blended several versions, with director Snyder taking some visual cues from pre-Crisis Krypton and the more recent Johns era Krypton, but with modern updates.  Krypton is very dark; however, we do only get to see it in its death throes, so that's fine so far as it goes.  Also, apart from the look of Krypton, the feel of Krypton evokes John Byrne's version--sterile and loveless.3.)  Superman is Boring - Most people don't associate Superman with deep pathos, and that goes hand in hand with viewing him as a bright, invulnerable do-gooder who never fails.  In the comics, unfortunately, this characterization is still predominant.  Goyer was very careful to avoid having Superman come off as shallow.  To be captivating, we need to be able to form an emotional connection.  Some may think that Goyer overcompensated here, making Clark too dark--even depressed/depressing--but overall he strikes the right balance, especially considering that the theme of this first film is alienation and finding your place in a complex world.  At the beginning of Clark's life, he's a tortured soul--having to keep secrets, unable to fight back, in a rocky relationship with his adoptive father--and by the end of the movie, he's still tortured, owing to the fact that he is forced to take a life.  (This was a gutsy decision by Goyer.  In this film he opts to depict Superman doing the one thing he rarely ever does--kill.  To Goyer's credit, he needed to take this route.  The movie needs to culminate in a one-on-one battle with General Zod, and by the end of it, there can only be one Kryptonian left on Earth.  Also, there is precedent for this in the comic books; the post-Crisis Superman similarly kills Zod and agonizes over it.)  Despite the stark realism and dark camera work (which Snyder is known for), for the larger part of the movie Superman can actually be fun (without being corny).  Deftly, Goyer has the character of Lois bring this side of him to the fore.4.)  Everyone Already Knows This Story - This is true.  Cleverly, Goyer undermines this by throwing in curve balls.  The first part of the movie spends a great deal of time on Krypton, a place the casual audience may not be very familiar with from the previous films.  The story also isn't linear.  It proceeds this way:  Krypon->Adult Clark Finding Himself->Flashbacks to Childhood->Present->Flashbacks to Krypton->Present.  This keeps the viewer feeling fresh and challenged.  The groundwork for the present plot is actually laid out in the Krypton scenes, where Kal-El isn't the focus at all.  (Jor-El, played by Russell Crowe, is the focus.  And he is brilliant.)  The issue could be raised that we've already seen the General Zod plotline in the 1970s Superman films and that it's now time for some new villains.  That may be true, but here the choice of the Kryptonian adversary is thematically mandated.  This film seeks to dissect Superman as man and alien, so the threat of Krypton must be felt.  If he wanted to be daring, Goyer could have opted to use the Eradicator as the Kryptonian villain rather than Zod, but plot-wise, having the villain try to terraform Earth in the image of Krypton atop the bones of humanity was the only way to go.  And it was a smart move to keep Luthor out of it altogether.",3,Leaps Low Expectations in a Single Bound,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,5206,"['Superman', 'difficult', 'icon', 'bring', 'big', 'screen',

1561731,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B008JFUPFI,J. Richardson,"[2, 8]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.The more I think about my experience with Man of Steel the more I realize how indifferent I feel towards the film. Nothing about it was inherently bad, but I kind of left the theater feeling like I didn't really get anything out of the movie. It should be noted that I've never been Superman's number one fan. Personally, I always enjoyed the cartoon that aired when I was a child over any of the films, but I expected this to be different. I think part of my indifference stems from me expecting one thing based on the trailers, but ending up receiving something slightly different. Now this has been a somewhat common occurrence as of late (Iron Man 3 & Now You See Me come to mind), but it never ceases to be annoying.By now it's common knowledge that the last attempt to reboot the Superman franchise was a total disaster. I have yet to meet someone who has anything nice to say about Superman Returns, but I think audiences will be singing a different tune about Man of Steel. While Returns was boring, predictable, and, to be honest, a little stupid, Man of Steel is strong, heartfelt, and confident in what it sets out to do. With that said, there was just something about its execution that didn't sit right with me.Man of Steel begins with the origin story; providing some slight deviations from the source material, but that's not what threw me off. While we were going through the events on Krypton I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a Star Wars movie. The environments, the color scheme, the weird lizard/dragon thing that Jor-El (Russell Crowe) kept riding around; it all looked like something ripped out of the prequel films. Not only that, but these environments aren't completely believable. Obvious CGI is obvious and I found it hard to focus on what was going on because everything just looked so fake. The worst part of it is that they spent at least a good 15-20 minutes (estimation, didn't time it) wasting time going over something that everyone knows about. I don't mind retelling an origin story, but make it snappy.Once we get off Krypton and find ourselves on Earth things start to smooth out a bit. From there we follow a confused Clark Kent aka Kal-El (Henry Cavill) as he tries to figure out who he is and where he came from. As the story progresses we get glimpses of Clark's upbringing through flashbacks. Usually these flashbacks occur after he passes out from doing some great feat like saving a ship crew. He soon meets Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and saves her life as she's doing a news report up in the mountains. We're given more details into his past as he explains his story to her and why he tries to keep himself hidden.To be honest, the connection being made between Clark and Lois is one of the best things about Man of Steel. It's very honest and pure and both parties know that neither of them are capable of understanding what the other is going through because they're two completely different people. Yet they know that there's some weird connection between the two of them and they're not sure what the appropriate action should be. All of this is excelled even further because Cavill and Adams have a beautiful chemistry onscreen that makes the whole thing just feel right.While I loved the introduction to these characters, I wasn't too fond of the predictability of the story. The antagonist in the film is General Zod (Michael Shannon), an ex-rebel on Krypton who gets sent to the Phantom Zone after killing Jor-El. Our time on Krypton comes to a close shortly after these events, but what got to me is the fact that Krypton exploded right after Zod was exiled. Not only that, but Lara Lor-Van (Ayeket Zurer) acted as if this were expected. If that's the case why send Zod to the Phantom Zone in the first place? Just let him blow up with everyone else. I knew that after they sent him off the planet he was going to eventually find his way to Earth. I knew this as someone who's only read a handful of the comics. Unfortunately, in movies like this, being able to predict the story 20 minutes in winds up taking some of the fun out of the experience.The other thing I really loved, aside from the perfectly cast Clark and Lois, was the fight sequences. This is how you make fight scenes in a comic book movie, or at least a Superman movie. Because these individuals aren't human their punches need to look powerful. Not only that, but the audience needs to be able to feel the force of the blows just by watching them on screen. Well Zack Snyder nailed it. Not all movie goers will understand the reference, but I found that the fight sequences reminded me of the fighting mechanics in the recently released Injustice: Gods Among Us (a fighting game featuring an extensive cast of DC characters.) The action is fast, it's powerful, and you can see just how hard they're hitting each other based on the destruction around the city. It was everything it needed to be and then some.Overall I felt the casting was very well done. I already mentioned my love for Cavill and Adams, but they're not the only ones who delivered with their performances. Kevin Costner and Diana Lane appear as Jonathan and Martha Kent, respectively. Both of them were perfectly cast for their roles and Diana Lane absolutely nailed her performance. Oh, that reminds me, the way Cavill was able to bring out the love that Clark has for Martha was outstanding. There's a scene where Zod goes to his house and Clark goes on a mini-rampage. Everything from his dialogue to his actions was beyond perfect. Michael Shannon gave another solid performance as Zod and Laurence Fishburn, a perfect choice by the way, was spot on as Perry White.Finally, the score, composed by Hans Zimmer, was a little underwhelming. I've grown very fond of Zimmer over the years, but most of the compositions just didn't seem to fit with their corresponding scenes. It seemed as if every single piece was this grand, larger-than-life composition and not every scene calls for that sort of thing. The occasional somber composition usually worked out, but there wasn't enough of it. Definitely not his strongest score, but I've heard worse.Overall Score: 7.75/10 - Man of Steel isn't one of those films that's perfect from start to finish. It's kind of a bumpy ride, but it more than makes up for it with the wonderful casting and the gripping action sequences. There's definitely room for improvement, and there's obviously going to be a sequel, so I look forward to seeing where they take this rebooted series in the future.",4,7.75 - Good,1372032000,"06 24,

Previous films dealt with more Silver age type adventures as the character of Superman became more and more like Clark Kent, instead of the reverse. Now we are presented with yet another version as another new-ish actor and a new hot director try to solve the long standing riddle of making a great Superman movie. In this case it appears they have. Man of Steel finally just shucks aside the humanity and admits that despite any protestations to the opposite, Kal El is a God. And he needs to fight other Gods. Like Zod. And when Gods do battle among mere mortals, humanity is swept aside in a terrible wave of carnage. And it is finally exciting because we are shown this is a film where there are terrible consequences to punching someone with the power of a thousand tons of TNT and driving them through multiple buildings. Buildings collapse and the people inside die, often falling like confetti to the streets below. It is at once both terrible and wonderful to behold. Finally the feeling of the danger and the speed inherit in the concept of a super powered slugfest is fully expressed with astounding visual and audio effects.

1561743,A1ZXYVYPOEDGTV,B008JFUPFI,Jus B. Cuz,"[5, 7]","Growing up, I was the Marvel Comic fan and my brother was into DC. We always challenged each others favorite superhero against each others. Eventually, we just agreed to disagree. To my appeal, in the past decade or so, there were many more Marvel movie adaptations created than DC. Sure, I loved the Dark Knight trilogy, but The Avengers and all the separate related movies for each superhero kept my Blu-Ray player busy.Until Man of Steel came out! Initially, I knew this picture would be something special and quite unique under Zack Snyder's direction. I have enjoyed his visionary work for years. Along with Christopher Nolan, Man of Steel was a relished break from my Marveldom. Having watched all previous Superman movies and re-runs of the George Reeve TV series, I couldn't resist. How happy I was!As I try to avoid the usual trash talk on the internet, my son was telling me these terrible things that people were saying about Man of Steel. To put his (and my own) reservations to rest, we saw this fabulous movie on opening day. 3D I-Max. Got my $17 ticket worth! While he saw it from a 12 year olds eyes, I saw so much more! Unlike Val Kilmer's Batman or George Clooney as the more goofy version, I will venture to say that EVERY cast member in Man of Steel was fully fleshed out. 3 dimensional characters who made you feel what they felt.From the beginning scenes on Krypton, WE were on Krypton like never before. How the Kryptonian's lived for as long as they lived it. A fully immersive environment that was more biological than ecological. Hence their impending destruction. Before now, we only had glimpses or notions of Krypton in prior movies, comics or cartoons. Each member of Krypton society has (or had) a specific function, and lived to that end. Of those we do meet, no matter how diabolical, one gets their full depth of meaning to said function. There are no ""cardboard"" actors here! General Zod/Michael Shannon truly believes that killing Jor-El/Russell Crowe was out of fury. We can feel this out of the passion of pain. As he watched the only future he had rocket away. The 2 were friends and this death on Zod's hands scars him to the end.On Earth, Kevin Costner/Jonathan Kent takes in baby Kal-El/Clark Kent. Along with Martha/Diane Lane, as adopted parents, I believe they do the best any parent would. Unconditional love, teach wrong from right and seek spiritual guidance. As seen several times, the ""human condition"" prevails. As Clark grows from a young boy, he naturally questions these powers he finds he has. Yet Jonathan continues to allow Clark to make the choice. At one point, Clark even asks Jonathan, ""Why did God do this to me?"" Purely in a hypothetical way as he knows there is no answer. THIS is the spirituality essence of this film. At another critical juncture, and more likely the most important, Clark walks into a church to further seek spiritual guidance as to how and what to do when he knows the fate of all life on Earth depends on his ""coming out"" as Kal-El. Ultimately, a Man of the Cloth gives him the support needed.  While Superman may be seen as ""god-like"", he too needs a ""Higher Power"" to look to for the unknown. I thought this was not only relevant but highly un-noticed by all the nay-sayers!These vignettes that occur throughout Clark's life is, inevitably, what makes him the man he becomes. Well before he is the Man of Steel. In his life, in life itself, we must learn morals, values and principals. This goes for anybody. To know the difference from right and wrong and WHY? Jonathan continually tells Clark that ""the world isn't ready to find out about him."" He makes the ultimate sacrifice to keep the ""secret."" As that tornado is about to suck him away, he waves Clark off. Had Clark ran or flew to save Jonathan, those under the underpass would surely have found out! Spread the word about the ""guy who can fly!"" But the time wasn't right because CLARK wasn't ready.In turn, now fully Kal-El, Superman makes his own ultimate sacrifice. Just before Zod was able to depress the fire button and blow up the plane ahead, as it was preparing to destroy the Dark Zero, Kal crashes through Zod's ship. Kal's eyes are lit wit  his heat vision and ready to take out Zod, Zod yells out and stops him. ""Wait, if you destroy this ship, you destroy Krypton!"" Kal thinks for a second and retorts, ""Krypton had its chance!"" Then relights his eyes and proceeds to take out Zod's ship. THAT was Clark's/Kal-El's/Superman's ultimate sacrifice.Was Man of Steel too violent as some (many) have claimed? Actually, no? When the fighting scenes happen, the special effects are some of the best I have seen in many years! But they are NOT RAMPANT throughout the movie. The destruction of Krypton was no more graphic than ""Vulcan's"" destruction in ""Star Trek."" The fight scenes are limited to either Smallville or Metropolis. I mean, there are aliens fighting that are god-like status. This is Superman! Who doesn't know the Superman mythos? The city of Metropolis being crushed, well, let's see... Godzilla has done worse. Clover in ""Cloverfield or ""The Avengers"" battling the ""Tretarri"" took out a bigger chunk of Manhattan. There are many others...Look, this is a Superman for THIS generation. I had no problem having my 12 year old son watch this with me. And Blu-Ray too now. Man of Steel is by NO MEANS OVER THE TOP. I fear more from what both of my kids can view on the internet. And as far as what the ""internet talking heads"" say, well, I have a few choice words I shan't post here for them!I absolutely suggest, highly recommend getting Man of Steel on Blu-Ray! DVD doesn't do this justice. The special effects are outstanding! If you do get this package, this comes with a bonus 3rd disc full of extras. I was floored when I saw just how much was special effects! You will not be disappointed!Final thought here... to those who wrote the 1 or 2 Star reviews... I think that there are just some people out here who will not be happy with anything. Maybe they secretly watched Man of Steel and loved it, but were bummed out because their ""date"" stood them up & popcorn was cold!",5,"""DC's"" Man of Steel...Steals this ""Marvel"" Superhero Fan!

I was not disappointed, this new remake blew me away with its visual effects (including the 3D), a great story, great action and an awesome villain.  Henry Cavill played a great superman who is trying to find his way.

It starts at the beginning, with SuperBaby being born on the planet Krypton to the mother and father Jorell(Russell Crowe).  (Please forgive name mispellings) The core of Krypton is collapsing.  War has broken out as General Zod fights for control.  He kills one of the high muckity mucks and attempts to take Jorell.  Just in the nick of time, Mom and Dad catapult SuperBaby to Planet Earth, so that he may live, along with a metal object for his later use.  Back on Krypton, General Zod and his henchpersons are banished to the Phantom Zone but swears he will find the son of Jorell one day and take revenge.  (You know all this anyway from the former versions of Superman.)We fast-forward about 30 years where we meet a grown up Superguy Clark Kent (Henry Cavill, who also played in the Immortals).  Superguy is working on a ship.  We flip back and forth for awhile to Clark at different ages and learn about how he got to Earth, how he was found by his Earth Mom and Dad Kevin Costner.  We also look at how Clark grew up and the wisdom his dad taught him.  Now Clark is about age 30 and he moves around a lot, to keep from being identified for his unique skills.In Antartica, he meets reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams from the Disney musical Enchanted), and Lois realizes there is something real special about Super Dude.  As with any nosey reporter, and against the wishes of her editor (Lawrence Fishburn), she begins to snoop.  Meanwhile General Zod is out and about and looking for Cal-El (aka Superman) to get the Codex and bring it back to what's left of the people of Krypton.This is a high-action movie.  Once the action starts, it will blow you away.  The CGI is awesome and so much gets blown and blasted and smashed.  The CGI people did one fantastic job.  BTW - Christopher Meloni (Law and Order SVU) is also in the film and my son recognized lots of other folks that I didn't remember, other than they looked familiar.This was a great movie to see on the big screen and I think you will probably want to own it when it comes out too.

This man clearly likes sex on the first date and then probably spends a lot of money on gifts trying to find romance.  The Superman story is a classic mythology that has been told many times better than this.  Of course he has a ton of video games to his credit, so that explains the jerky back and forth story line that relies on too much flash back, because he wanted to get to the action right away.What this does is steal from the audience, that wonder of self-discovery and conflict of the youthful Clark Kent.  Also lost is the Clack and Lois dance of discovery.  What we are left with is lots of top notch special effects, some clever game puzzle moments and a story that in the end is not satisfying.It would be as if Harry Potter started at the last half of book seven than inserted parts of the previous six books to try to get you to care about the characters you never had a change to grow with.  My wife who enjoys the super hero genre went to bed, annoyed with the whole mess.Particularly bad is the self-indulgent, hot aired pretentious Jonathan Kent, played and I suspect partially written by Kevin Costner at his worst.  Even John Schneider of TV's Smallville was a more down to earth and real father.  {small spoiler}  When we reach the moment of Papa Kent's required death, it is over the top, pretentious and pathetic.  Our reaction was, &#34;I hope that's the last flash back with him in it, glad he's gone. &#34; This moment should bring pain to the audience.. It won't because the relationship is disjointed.When I look at the cast on paper.. this should be a winner.  but in the end.. The writer gave the director very little to salvage out of this weak video game construction.  I gets three stars because I like who this Superman is trying to be you could do something with this cast as long as you never ever let the writer of this film near the franchise.

1561779,AMS0KR29YZXCE,B008JFUPFI,"Kenneth Sohl ""ksohl@bellsouth.net""","[2, 5]","Upon watching &#34;Superman Returns&#34;, I was surprised that, after all the years that has passed since the 1st Chris Reeves film, it was simply a rehash of that older (and better) film, though Brandon Ruth did a passable imitation of Reeves, and Kevin Spacey did a good impression of Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor. Therefore, I was expecting &#34;Man of Steel&#34;, following hard on &#34;Returns&#34;' trail, to be an apology and take it to the next level, and I'm glad to say that I was definitely not disappointed.The first thing I noticed was the photography, done in a grittily realistic way, with harsh shadows and realistic lighting.  I wouldn't have thought that a fantasy like &#34;Superman&#34; would lend itself to that sort of filming, and it was a daring choice on the part of the director, but it works great in this instance.  Perhaps that's just the kind of detail it takes to bring the viewer intimately into the action and suspending disbelief while watching a story that is based on a premise utterly devoid of any reality.I understand that in the last 2 decades, the Superman comics have taken a turn for the darker, as most superhero titles have in emulation of Frank Miller's &#34;the Dark Knight&#34;, so I was rather concerned as to how they would portray him here.  No worries, this is still the same Superman we all know;  he's just in the real world now.  Henry Cavill's portrayal is also spot on, reflecting Reeve's optimism tempered with a slight reserve that might be instilled in him by the harsh choices the real world forces him to make.  And in spite of some very minor &#34;re-imagining&#34;, I'm pleasantly surprised at how political correctness never reared its ugly head.I've noticed a recurring theme in fantasy/sci-fi blockbusters recently.  &#34;Star Trek: Into Darkness&#34; and the &#34;Dark Knight&#34; films explored pretty much the same theme: the hero trying to defeat evil while struggling to keep himself above it.  MOS actually turned that theme on its head as only Superman can do.  Here, our hero has to struggle to find enough negativity in himself to do what needs to be done, then live with his actions.I'd also like to address some criticisms of this movie.1) All CGI and no content - Bull, this movie had a lot of heart, a great cast, and a great story.  Yes, there is a lot of destructionaction at the end, but everything happens to further the plot, and this is SUPERMAN!  What do you want, a lot of talkyphilosophical debates??  Also, though I, too, prefer rubber monsters over computer cartoons in my grade-B movies, theFX here are truly exceptional.  CGI has finally arrived, and the film makers themselves are no longer using it like somepunk kid who just learned something new, but actually using some restraint in the camera angles and zooming close-ups.2) Superman should have lured the villains away from the city - this is an utterly stupid comment.  How many villains do youknow who are so cooperative?  That's why they are villains.  Reality isn't always so convenient.  That might have workedin the comics of the '50s, but anyone who watches the film will see that Supes never really had the chance, things hap-pened so fast.  Superman has been toned down in the last 2 decades to not be QUITE so &#34;super&#34;.3) Superman should have saved his father - I agree, but what happens does lend itself to a recurring theme in this movie.At any rate, it came nowhere near to spoiling the rest of the movie for me.4)Krypton's atmosphere...Earth's Sun...blah,blah... - I'm reviewing this movie based on the skill and imagination it took tomake it, not judging it by how closely it sticks to the comics.  Yes, it should be faithful to its source material, and I'd saythat it is in the most important aspects.  As for details of how kryptonians achieve super powers, is anybody really brain-dead enough to think that there can be any plausible theory put forth to explain what they do in this movie?  It's a &#34;whatif&#34; fantasy;  accept that they do it and move on, otherwise, the whole thing will be made impossible, no matter how muchtechno-babble you inject.After years of shaking my head at Hollywood's inability to come up with anything truly original, I'm finding that it is coming up with films that are really, really entertaining, at least. Yes, I enjoy Cohen Brother's and David Lynch films, as well as Sergio Leone, orold classics like &#34;Frankenstein&#34; and &#34;Johnny Guitar&#34;, but I'm not so narrow-minded as to turn my nose up at popular fare like thismovie, or &#34;the Avengers&#34;.  This was a great viewing experience, if you give it a chance, and (shame for a die-hard Batman fan to admit), perhaps the most enjoyable superhero flick ever.  If you fanboys don't like it, then go pull your comic book collection out from under your bed.  I will be looking forward to the next installment.I",5,BEST SUPERMAN YET!,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,4884,"['watching', '34', 'Superman', 'Returns', '34', 'was', 'surprised', 'years', 'passed',

1561786,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B008JFUPFI,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[7, 15]","Let me first say that I've always believed that Superman as a whole is somewhat dull.  Supes is bogged down by the fact that he ignited the Golden Age of Comics.  He's an almighty being with few, if any, flaws, and that makes him boring to me.  There have been many attempts over the years to ""humanize"" him and give him flaws on the printed page (all to varying degrees of success) and even an attempt on the big screen with ""Superman Returns,"" whenever he was given a son born out of wedlock to Lois Lane.  He's the perfect hero for youngsters, as his super powers make him a wonderful being to dream about and pretend to be while playing.  When puberty or another harsh reality of life hits and things become complicated, children turn to darker heroes such as Batman, Daredevil, etc.Now for my review.The film opens with the token destruction of Krypton, albeit with a slight twist in the relationship of the main antagonist, General Zod, and Jor-El.  Kal-El is sent to Earth with hope for the future entrusted to him by his father and mother.  Zod and his comrades are imprisoned, but not before they promise to find Kal-El.  Once they find him, their intentions are fairly obvious.  From there, we witness the development of Superman in real time and flashbacks.  I enjoyed this aspect of the film, as we got to see Kal-El experience and deal with things like heat vision, x-ray vision, super hearing, and super strength for the first time.  We also get to see him struggle with the urge to use his powers when certain situations call for them.Eventually fate catches up with Kal-El, and Zod and his pleasant pals find Superman on Earth.  Zod is on a mission to start a new Krypton and will stop at nothing to make this mission come to fruition.  The only thing standing in his way is the boy who fell from the sky in Kansas and an all-out slugfest ensues.***POTENTIAL SPOILER WARNING***The results, despite being very loud and destructive, are fairly by-the-book.  At no time in the film did I have any doubt that Superman would stop Zod.  While the battles were taking place, all I could think about were the jumbled, blurry battles of the ""Transformers"" films.  I knew that action was taking place, but I really couldn't see it.  The 3-D factor didn't help the situation either.  In fact, if you are reading this review while ""Man of Steel"" is still in theaters, save your money and do not watch it in 3-D.  It adds nothing to the film.As many have already alluded to, Superman does quite a few un-Supermanly things.  While I understand the argument that some use for a few of his actions in the film (He was still developing his powers and/or had not realized how much danger those powers would put himself or others in), I also know that from the beginning, even within this film, Kal-El was ingrained with the ideals of protecting humanity at all costs and doing what is right.  I don't even mind the fact that in this film he kills someone.  What bothers me is the fact that he endangers the lives of innocents, which is something Superman ALWAYS tries to avoid.***END POTENTIAL SPOILERS***""Man of Steel"" attempts to make Superman grittier, and for that, I do applaud writers David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan.  Nolan did a brilliant job with his take on Batman on the big screen, making a grim character even darker.  Goyer has had his ups and downs over the years.  In my opinion he either knocks a story out of the park (""Blade"" and ""Blade II"") or fails miserably (""Blade: Trinity"" and ""Jumper"").  Somehow he and Nolan managed to make Superman grittier but still dull at the same time with ""Man of Steel.""Of course, having Zack Snyder guide the entire project is hit and miss as well.  I have really enjoyed some of Snyder's work (""Watchmen"") but often find myself shaking my head at his projects like ""300"" and ""Sucker Punch.""  He relies very, very heavily on a stylized look for his films.  This worked brilliantly for ""Watchmen,"" but the story suffered in ""300"" and ""Sucker Punch.""Ironically, Snyder seems to have held back a bit on the style this go 'round, losing a lot of the polish his films usually come with, and amped up the action to near-Michael Bay levels.  This, in my opinion, hurt ""Man of Steel"" more than it helped.  For those of you who skipped the ""spoiler"" section, know that 3-D adds nothing to the film.I also believe that Snyder's guidance of the actors lead to a few wooden performances.  Henry Cavill is okay as Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El, but there are moments in the film where he seems to be attempting to channel Christopher Reeve (something I believe Brandon Routh managed to do brilliantly in ""Superman Returns""), that actually hurt his performance.  This isn't Reeve's version of Superman, apparently, so why attempt to bring some of that character to the table?  I also felt that Diane Lane (Martha Kent) delivered a less-than-stellar performance.  I enjoy watching Lane in other films, but something just didn't click with me in her portrayal of Martha.  Ayelet Zurer portrays Lara, Superman's mother, and while her role is quite small in the film, I felt that her performance overall was average at best.Amy Adams was decent as Lois Lane.  When first introduced to her character, Adams brought the fearlessness of Lois to the forefront.  As the film wore on, however, the character seems to lose a step.  Michael Shannon (General Zod) chewed up any and every scene he was in.  His Zod was burly, barking, and one-track minded.  I never could really find any attachment to his character though and in the end, I was glad when his barking stopped.Despite these bumps in the road, there were quite a few bright spots in this film, however.  Kevin Costner nailed his brief turn as Jonathan Kent.  Costner is starting to show his age, and was perfect for the role.  Another bright spot was Russell Crowe as Jor-El.  Even though I knew what was going to happen to him, I cheered him on in the beginning of the film.  He seemed genuinely concerned for his people and for his son's life.  He was quite possibly the best performer in the entire film.  One other performance worthy of special mention is that of Antje Traue, who portrayed Zod's right hand man...er..woman, Faora-Ul.  While she didn't have many lines in the film, she was excellent with the few she had.  I actually hope to see her return in the next film, as I felt she was more imposing than Zod.Other performances worth noting are those of Michael Kelly (Lombard), Rebecca Buller (Jenny), Laurence Fishburne (Perry White), and Mackenzie Gray (Jax-Ur).  While all of these actors had small roles, they did solid jobs with them.Overall, I'd have to say that ""Man of Steel"" is a mediocre flick.  I went in hoping to see a new spin on an old hero and I got that, but so much of the core character was peeled away that the film ended up somewhat hollow.  I do believe that Henry Cavill has the goods when it comes to portraying Superman, I just believe that a better director and better story would have helped him greatly.  Much like Brandon Routh, he was weighed down by good intentions that eventually killed the film overall.Mildly recommended, as it was nice to see Supes on the big screen again.

I've read some reviews that said there was not enough character development and that the final third of the film had too much action. I don't agree with either of those opinions. I thought the setup with Clark searching for his origins was really well done, I thought the use of flashbacks moved things along faster and was very interesting, and I loved the way Lois tracked him down and the way their first meeting went.As far as the action and special effects went. Wow!! I will say that I can understand how some people would feel that the length and intensity of the action at the end might be exhausting, but in my case, I have been wanting to see Superman in that kind of building-collapsing slugfest since I first HEARD of the character. It was GREAT!! And the part where you see Zod gaining the power of flight and taking off his Kryptonian armor was truly scary. I found myself thinking, ""Jeez, if Superman doesn't take him down right now, he may not be able to later, and the world will be lost!"".

Henry Cavill truly provides an excellent portrayal of Clark Kent/Superman and hopefully is permitted to remain in the character until the conclusion of the much anticipated, although unannounced, Justice League. The bonus features explain what it took to get his body transformed to the chiseled physique witnessed in and out of uniform, as well as the changing that took place mentally that literally caused him to take on the persona. Such characters as Superman come with a lot of weight due to the portrayal left former actors that have become iconic, and in this instance it is none other than Christopher Reeves, who acted so superbly and therefore his movies have become seared in the minds of us who are old enough to draw from that experience. I do not know if Cavill can ever hope to top the legacy Christopher Reeves left with the way he owned the character, and that may not be his aim. But nonetheless he knows this is the expectation; at the very least to come close to the pinnacle even if he does not stand atop of it. That will be cool, too because he now stands in a very exclusive club of men who have donned the blue and red. That aspect alone is something to share with family & friends and treasure for the rest of his life. The supporting cast molded together nicely, and even with the Man of Steel having to kill General Zod rather than banishing him to the Phantom Zone as done previously, was shocking but clearly showed that struggle anyone can and could face when there is no other option.

What started off as a somewhat promising flick turned into a CGI on steroids descent into apathy for me. I swear Zod and Kal-El had to have fought for 3 hours smashing each other through buildings and refineries and throwing cars and UPS trucks at each other. It got downright annoying. It wasn't the kind of awesome CGI fighting like in the Return of the King battles, this is just plain annoying.Henry Cavill is a good guy, but frankly he lacks the spark, the twinkle in his eye, the fun, and the overall &#34;esse&#34; of Superman. Yeah, I grew up with Chris Reeves as Superman, but I was 100% ready to give Cavill a chance. Afterall, I like Christian Bale's Batman a whole lot better than the previous actors who portrayed the Dark Knight when I was younger, but Cavill is just lackluster. I blame Chris Nolan for that a bit.I think when it comes to dark characters like Batman, Chris Nolan is the ONLY guy who should be directing or producing! However, when it comes to Superman, it doesn't work. Nolan and company make Superman dark and brooding, quiet and complicated, melancholy and odd.Amy Adams is so-so.Michael Shannon is a TERRIBLE General Zod. And I hate how Nolan tries to make him somewhat sympathetic. Shannon overacts like crazy and really got under my skin. If only Michael Fassbender weren't already playing Magneto! Guys like Fassbender fit the role much better. Zod is sinister in the comics (as if anyone reads the comics anymore and knows these characters anyway!) and a terror. This Zod is a whiny baby and, as stated, overacted.There wasn't the cool banter or interesting stuff at the Daily Planet, the story about Krypton was a change from the original material but rather went along with the 1980's re-imagined story, etc.What do I hope (even though I KNOW this won't happen!), just re-boot this movie. Re-cast Cavill but this time give him some room to smile and be an interesting character. Put Michael Emerson in as Lex Luther, DROP Hans Zimmer from the soundtrack (I LOVE Zimmer! His Last Samurai and Batman scores were awesome!, but Superman needs to be more upbeat and hopeful, exciting and fun, less brooding and dark), change things up.

Growing up in Jamaica in the late-1970s and 1980s with a black-and-white box, then the first colour box in my neighbourhood, meant my house was movie central. The television station was 9 to 5 for most of my youth, and evolved to late night viewing on holidays. Rambo, Dirty Harry, Rocky, spaghetti westerns, and SUPERMAN were highlights of Christmas holidays. Sylvester Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, and Christopher Reeve were family who came to visit on the holidays. We waited eagerly in front of the tube for them, were overjoyed when they arrived, and weeping when they left. The evolution of Superman over the years is a rite of passage along a mystical timeline for me. In 1978 I was still turning a knob to change a channel, and my dada was climbing on the roof in the rain to re-position the antenna. In 2013, I'm watching movies on demand, commercial-free, and online. From 1978 to 2013, Superman movies represent more than film production, acting, and criticisms; that's 35 years of entertaining all walks of life across the world, 35 years of technological advancement, 35 years of keeping the hope of mankind alive. Movies like Superman encouraged a little island girl to dream beyond boundaries, push the limits, and achieve beyond her imagination. The movie has come a long way since 1978, and so have I.

1561807,A39675KXEV8UK8,B008JFUPFI,Kyle Shultz,"[11, 16]","After seeing this film, I can understand why the critical reaction to it was largely mixed. However, for the life of me, I don't see why it got a worse reception than ""Superman Returns"". If you're looking for a Superman movie that avoids the mistakes of that film, you have definitely come to the right place - even if ""Man of Steel"" doesn't succeed on every level.Here's a rundown of the good and the bad. WARNING: some spoilers within, though I'll try to avoid revealing any major plot twists.THE GOOD:The Effects: I can't say enough good things about this aspect of the film. This is the most truly alien take on Krypton we've seen in any Superman film yet. The harsh yet beautiful landscape, the intricate spaceships, the three-dimensional liquid metal displays...the entire opening sequence featuring Kal-El's home planet was truly jaw-dropping. The same level of quality holds for the scenes with Superman displaying his powers. Zack Snyder's more ""violent"" take on the hero's flying makes it look remarkably realistic. The visuals in this film never ""pop"" the viewer out of the story, they draw you in. Actually, if the FX were the only point in the movie's favor, I'd still say it was worth watching once just to see them. Fortunately, there's more.The Storyline: I was somewhat disappointed when I learned Lex Luthor would not be returning for this film (though his presence in the Man of Steel universe is acknowledged in a very subtle fashion). Fortunately, the plot manages quite well without him, focusing on Superman's alien heritage rather than humans trying to bring him down. The theme of the implications of discovering that an alien walks among us lies at the center of the story, and leads to some interesting conversations among the main characters. The new mythology established for Krypton is very clever, and makes some of the typical elements of Superman's origin more rational. Kryptonite is absent, which is a good thing, in my opinion. Another weakness of Superman from the comics is used to prevent him being completely undefeatable - namely, his reliance on yellow sun radiation. All together, the plot is very coherent, though the actual storytelling suffers at times, as I'll explain later on.The Main Character: The film's missteps aside, it did give us a worthy new version of the world's greatest superhero. Cavill nails the many faces of Clark Kent. Kansas farm boy, reluctant hero, alien visitor - he skillfully pulls off every aspect of the character...except perhaps for one, which may or may not disappoint the viewer. Clark Kent the bumbling reporter is not really featured here. I won't reveal exactly how the idea of Superman's dual identity plays out, but let's just say it's a bit more complicated than putting on a pair of glasses and magically deflecting suspicion. Also, in regard to a certain difficult decision Superman makes toward the end of the film - in context, it's made very clear that he had no other choice. That's not to say this scene was perfectly executed, but it definitely still belongs in the movie.THE BAD:The Pacing: This is Man of Steel's biggest flaw. Everything just happens too quickly. In the Batman films, we had time to breathe between fights and dramatic twists, thanks to scenes that helped flesh out the characters and make their journeys more believable. Despite MoS's two-and-a-half hour length, it feels like Snyder and Nolan were struggling to fit everything in that they wanted to show. The first half of the movie is so rapid-fire it feels surreal at times, and the second half is so congested with concrete-smashing fights that by the time I was done watching, I felt exhausted.The Storytelling: I'm all for innovation in this category, but Man of Steel would have benefited from a good old-fashioned linear storyline. Once the Krypton scenes are done, we start jumping haphazardly between Clark's childhood and his adulthood, then back again. It's enough to make you seasick. I got the feeling that Snyder was trying to reinvent the wheel here. He veered off in another direction just as we were about to see the classic ""spaceship in the cornfield"" scene - no doubt an attempt to subvert expectations - but it didn't actually improve the film at all. Yes, we've seen the Kents finding Clark a hundred times before, but honestly, I wouldn't have minded seeing it again. And Clark would have seemed more relatable if his childhood scenes had all taken place at the beginning, giving the audience a better perspective on the gradual changes in his motivations and personality.The Fights: This has been brought up many times before by other reviewers, but there really is too much property damage in Man of Steel. I realize that the locations in question were mostly abandoned, so the death toll from the actual battles was probably zero (not counting what Zod's evil plot probably did to a few unfortunate citizens of Metropolis), but I feel that there's still a problem here. Snyder was obviously trying to show the raw power of Superman and Zod by showing how much damage they did just by tripping over a piece of rebar (that's an exaggeration, but you get what I mean). However, after a while, you start to concentrate more on how many buildings are getting leveled than on who's winning the fight. It's distracting. You can't help but wonder, right in the middle of all the action, how Metropolis will ever recover from all this, and that takes your focus off the story itself.The Humor: Or rather, the lack thereof. Let's face it - cool as it may be, Superman's story isn't exactly ""believable"". You could picture a billionaire playboy using gadgets to fight crime in real life, but not an alien with incredible powers living secretly among humans. Some gentle mockery here and there would actually have helped the movie. Instead, every single element of the Superman tale is treated as deadly serious. There are only a handful of funny moments here, and while they work, there aren't nearly enough of them. A few more laughs would have done wonders for the Clark/Lois romance as well. Also, call me old-fashioned, but I feel that a Superman movie should be family-friendly. It's just in the nature of the character. Instead, there are far too many moments of profanity (not from Supes, but still) and a little too much PG-13 violence. It's mostly bloodless, but it could have been toned down without adversely affecting the story. Sorry, but the world doesn't need a gritter Superman.Amy Adams: Don't get me wrong, she's adorable, and she's a fantastic actress, but she brings nothing new to this role. I don't feel that she had no chemistry with Clark, but she lacked that feistiness that made previous Loises so enjoyable. The more subdued nature of her performance could, of course, be partly blamed on the lack of light-heartedness I mentioned. Erica Durance's Lois would have been asking why everyone was so glum. (I'm not a Smallville fan by any stretch, but she was amazing.)Michael Shannon: He's not a bad actor, but his Zod came across as more petulant than intimidating. It may sound silly, but a British accent would have done wonders here - possibly because that's what people commonly associate with Zod. Antje Traue's Faora is far more successful as a compelling villain, even if she doesn't get much development.CONCLUSIONS: Man of Steel is an essentially good film with some elements of greatness, and I believe that it signals a new and better age for the character of Superman. I probably will want to watch it again someday, though I'm still glad I rented it instead of buying it sight unseen. Hence the three stars instead of four. It doesn't quite deserve the 56% it got on Rotten Tomatoes, but it suffers from some unwise directorial decisions, a couple of poorly cast roles, and and a paucity of wit and charm. I highly recommend watching it, but don't expect the Superman movie you've been hoping for since the Christopher Reeve era. Perhaps that day will come in time.",3,"Flawed, but a step in the right direction",1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,7983,"['seeing', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'critical', 'reaction', 'was',

1561809,A2VQ3I1TR364UU,B008JFUPFI,LADY HA! HA!,"[7, 17]","Super OverdoseThe Man of Steel was the man of over-do. This movie was filled with SUPER Action, SUPER noise and SUPER Side effects.  It's obvious we all know how it ends, good verses evil and Superman saving the world, so with that said,  I will share my  thoughts on what those who haven't seen the movie may not know. We have a movie that is filled with loads of action, trips to space, galaxy's, mixed with earthy surroundings, and lots of flashbacks through out the movie.  The space ships to me, looked like the Cicad's bugs that have been hiding for the past 17 years and just recently  have been circulating amongst us. Who knows, maybe Michael Shannon who played the truly believable villain,""General Zod"" brought them with him after he resurfaced to earth after 33 years of living in some type of cocoon. Shannon did a excellent job as portraying a villain. He was forceful, uncompassionate, tuff, strong and powerful. His facial expressions were even  convincing to  be the cold hearted character he played.  Lets face it, everyone likes a Super Hero, but Shannon was a Super Villain and I enjoyed his role and acting immensely.  Then we have Russell Crow who played the biological  father of superman. He made me Super happy when he didn't belt out a song ""singing"" a Super lullaby to baby Superman before sending the small wonder off into space to save the world.  The booms and the crashes through out the movie were bit much. The constant jumping  from one point to another, zig zagging  was as if there was a tennis match going on, and the dialogue did not always gel at times. Speaking of gel, Henry Cavill did a excellent job  in playing the part as Superman. While we watched him bounce off walls, crash into buildings, fly in the ski, I couldn't help but to notice how Super wonderful Superman's hair looked through out the movie, no doubt Super Gel, it never moved. The flashback during the movie showing superman childhood were my favorite parts of the movie, that's where you saw and felt  the true heart of the show.  All in All, if your  into  super action, your going to like it. What I felt it lacked was being able to reach the young viewers.

Kal-El/Superman looked perfect, so I think they chose wisely. I do appreciate that they tried to do what the other films didn't, and that's go back and give you more information about Jor-El and Kal-El from Krypton, and what really happened before he became Superman. Instead of just showing you when he lands in Smallville where he is raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent, or even before he heads to Metropolis, works for the Daily Planet, and meets Lois Lane.Overall, I understand this movie is about the inner struggle with understanding your destiny, knowing who you are, and asking yourself if that's the person you want to be. In the end, we can run from who or what we are, but we'll never be able to change it. I loved the film's message. However, I have to agree with a lot of people on General Zod. I was disappointed there was no classic ""kneel before Zod"" line. You can't remake a classic and leave out important things like that because you know the fans are going to be looking for it. That was a huge mishap. I gave it 3 stars because while it was way better than Superman Returns by 5 miles; this still could have been so much better. They had some good ideas, but they relied to heavily on the special effects to wow the audience. Which worked for some people.

So once again we have a remake. This time its the third Superman actor and movie. Alright, if you want to do Superman again, give us a new story with likable characters. Why do you always have to rehash his origins over and over again? The movie is nothing more than a computer game- no personality, no plot, dark scenes, no humor, just graphics and special effects. End of rant.I must say that this version of Krypton was more interesting than the bleak ice world depicted in Christopher Reeve&#8217;s Superman movie. And when it jumped straight to Clark as a man, I thought, well at least we don&#8217;t have to waste time on a rehash of his youth - wrong! His youth was told via flash-backs.(BTW: There are a few spoilers from here on) The story/script is a departure in the normal story-line/time sequence in that Lois Lane meets Clark before he becomes her co-worker. She even tracks down where his home is/was! What a departure from the norm.Too much fighting. About half of the movie is one fight scene after another. I also didn&#8217;t like that in his fights with Zod, he was always the one huffing and puffing. Zod should be the one huffing since he isn&#8217;t used to Earth&#8217;s environments. Also, why would Superman have a hard time breathing aboard Zod&#8217;s ship that is filled with the atmosphere from Krypton? If Superman can fly into space, he shouldn&#8217;t have to breath anything - story writer&#8217;s error.My final grievance is with Superman killing someone with his bear hands. I don&#8217;t remember him ever doing that. He has always been pictured as a wholesome alien. He may push someone into a sun, but never to actually break someone&#8217;s neck! Boooh!

Even though I purchased this movie when it came out, it was still in the condition it was advertised as.  I also received it when I ordered it, which was two day service so I could receive it on the day it was released.  I would use this company again for future orders.As I put in almost all my reviews, I will not disclose much detail about the movie itself.  My reasoning for that is I don't want to take a chance of ruining it for other viewers.  With that said:This movie was awesome! Henry Caville plays an excellent Superman.  You have your Lois Lane, Clark Kent and that type of scenario in this movie, however, there are a quite few differences. But these are really good differences. For example, like you see in the reviews, you watch a young Clark Kent saving a bus load of children that ends up leaving witnesses.  Those witnesses cause him a little bit of trouble.  There's not that much more I can tell you without giving it away, except for:  There is awesome action, (a LOT of action), a much better storyline than the old one, and a fantastic ending.I've watched this movie about four times already and I can't wait to see what they come up with next with this Superman.  Or should I say Man of Steel.  As for it being in 3-D, there really isn't that much that comes out at you, but it was still better to watch in 3-D than it was in 2-D.

1561830,A24WWT2W1M61AQ,B008JFUPFI,"Lisa Traverso ""tripleSps3""","[6, 16]","Superman is one of the most iconic and well known characters not only in comics, but in entertainment history. Superman was the ideal that brought the modern day superheroes to life, and through the combination of revolutionary action comics and successful films (at least earlier on), Superman rose to become the best of superheros. However, after his second big screen adaptation, Superman lost his throne as king of comic books. His drop in quality in comic books and films made a lot of people lose respect and love for the character, and the original Superman film was dethroned by ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"" to many people as the greatest comic book movie of all time.This summer, director Zack Snyder (Watchmen, 300), producer Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception), and screenwriter David S. Goyer (Batman Begins, Blade) are here to attempt to change this, with Man of Steel. Man of Steel promises to be a more realistic take on the character, promising to finally make the character of Superman relatable, while delivering a Nolan-esque story, and promising to deliver on the epic action sequences after the lack of them in the latest Superman film, Superman Returns. Being hyped up as one of the most anticipated films of the year, can Man of Steel live up to the hype, or will this be the final piece of Kryptonite for the Superman film franchise?Man of Steel is the retelling of the Superman origin story. For those of you who aren't aware of the origin story, the film involves a planet far away called Krypton. At the start of the film, a baby is born on this planet, and shortly after, we learn that the planet is doomed, and that its core is collapsing on itself. So the parents of this baby, the father being Jor-El (played by Russel Crowe), are forced to send the baby to Earth to guarantee the survival of it and Krypton's citizens. Along with this, you also are introduced to the main protagonist, General Zod (played by Michael Shannon), as well as some other elements to the plot which I will not give away here.Once we reach Earth, the film jumps right into the main plot of the film, which juggles flashbacks to Clark Kent's childhood which run parallel to the events and character development in the main plot. The main plot involves the Superman origin story that we know: Clark Kent growing up being a bit of an outsider to most people, finding the Fortress of Solitude (which is much different in Man of Steel than in the previous films), and becoming Superman. However, shortly after finally donning the cape, General Zod invades Earth, threatening the existence of man kind. From there, it is up to Superman to stop him.I know, I know, a lot of people are most likely sick of superhero origin stories, especially reboots. However, to those who cry foul at these origin stories, you can be rest assured that Man of Steel's approach is the freshest and most exciting yet seen in recent comic book movies. Man of Steel includes the origin story of Superman, but this is NOT the same one that we saw in Richard Donner's film. Many new themes are explored, characters are given more of an amount of depth than in the previous films, and the storytelling, thankfully, doesn't focus on events we have had beaten into our heads before. For example, in the original Superman movie, the film went straight from a couple of scenes in Smallville straight to the Fortress of Solitude where he becomes Superman, but Man of Steel does a good job at exploring the character of Clark Kent before that.We learn more about how Clark Kent was an outsider, how he had to struggle with being human when he really wasn't (might I add, in a realistic way), and we also get to see a bit more of what happens to Clark between his voyage from Smallville and him finding the Fortress of Solitude. So, in this respect, even though it tells an origin story again, Man of Steel's storytelling does not feel at all like the previous films. In fact, thanks to Goyer's persistence at slowly feeding information about Clark's past to the audience throughout the film (even to the very last scene), Man of Steel's storytelling is interesting, fresh, and exciting.One of the biggest complains people have about the character of Superman is that he isn't relatable. Well, thanks to a clever script and a story centered much more around the development of Clark Kent, Man of Steel fixes this. This take on Superman shows Superman as much more vulnerable, and much more of a ""man"" in the title of ""Superman"" than the previous incarnations. Goyer's attempts at making a more relatable and modern Superman really work. While this Superman still stands for justice and is selfless, he is also human, feels pain, and is, ultimately, a man inside of an alien body. The film does an excellent job at displaying this, making the audience feel far more connected to its hero than in previous Superman films.In addition to making Superman more relatable, the main villain, General Zod, has been given a surprising amount of depth in the film. People say that great drama comes from opposing ideas of right and wrong, and Man of Steel really embodies this with General Zod. General Zod certainly is menacing and villanous, but some of his actions are also justified. He is a villain who is a bit misunderstood, who has good intentions in regards to his own people, but someone who uses violent methods, and is ultimately holding onto a world that is helplessly gone forever. It is great stuff, and a fantastic reimagining of the classic villain.What has also been further explored in Man of Steel is the father son relationship. I wish I could talk more about it, but suffice to say, both Jor-El and Jonathan Kent, Superman's human father, are both further explored and freshened out in the film, and the scenes with them and Clark really make for an emotionally captivating and moving experience. I never thought these characters would be fleshened out, or given the amount of screen time, that they were, but I am certainly glad that they were.There are other elements to the plot, such as some sci fi elements that relate to the comics, the story of Lois Lane and Superman growing as a couple, the film treating Superman's arrival as sort of a ""first contact"" type scenario (which is brilliantly executed by the way), and some other plot points that I can't really further talk about here, but suffice to say, despite the number of things that it has to juggle at times, the story is simple enough, but deep enough, that it is all satisfying. Man of Steel's story is extremely ambitious, and fortunately, it does a fantastic job at delivering.Delivering as many thrills as the story is the ensemble. To start, Henry Cavill is a fantastic Superman, and is without a doubt the best one we have seen since Christopher Reeves. Henry Cavill is humble, selfless, and heroic as Superman, but also bringing out the pain in his character, as well as his human side, far more than many interpretations of the character. When we see what he has to sacrifice, the choices he has to make for the better of people, and see him grow as a charater is so satisfying thanks to Cavill's performance. Additionally, he REALLY looks the part, and he sounds exactly like you would imagine Superman sounding like.Just as fantastic, although not sharing as much screen time, are the two fatherly figures: Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent and Russel Crowe as Jor-El. Jonathan Kent is far more concerned about Clark Kent revealing who he really is to the world, but he still loves him like a son, and Kevin Costner does a brilliant job at displaying that. There are some truly emotionally moving scene between him and Clark throughout the film that really make us connect to both characters, and Kevin Costner's performance  sells every single minute. In a similar sense, Russel Crowe does a fantastic job at playing a father who, ironically, wants his son to explore who he really is, and to help other people with it, and these sort of opposing ideas really play out in interesting ways, and in ways that aren't so black and white, and it is quite refreshing.Michael Shannon does a great job as General Zod for the interpretation of the character that we are given. While I wish he was slightly more menacing, I still very much appreciated his performance, and I felt that he was a very good villain for Superman to go up against. On the other hand, I found Amy Adams to be the best Lois Lane in the history of the Superman franchise, thanks to her charm and her display of feminist qualities that make her far more than another damsal in distress. Additionally, her relationship with Superman felt much more natural than it does in other comic book films. While they didn't explore the relationship as much as some people would want, there is definitely room for growth in future sequels.Additionally, the rest of the supporting cast, including Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, and some extremely talented kids playing young versions of Clark Kent (seriously I normally hate kid actors, but they were great in Man of Steel), the acting across the board is fantastic.One of the biggest complaints of past Superman films is that the action is seriously lacking, and Superman simply doesn't kick enough butt. Well, to everyone who had previously complained about that, your prayers have been answered with Man of Steel. The action sequences in this film are big in scale, epic, and powerful. Superman throws more than just a couple of punches, and buildings and city blocks are knocked over and destroyed like legos with a little kid. These fight sequences feel as if they were ripped straight out of Superman comic books, and they are awesome. They really display how powerful Superman is, how deadly a fight with him can be, and the modern wonders of CGI that can be used to show off a powerful superhero.All of these scenes, both the amazing action sequences (including the best final fight I have seen in a superhero movie) and the quieter, more tender moments in the film, are complimented with an amazing original score by Hans Zimmer. While nothing can top the original Superman theme by John Williams, the score here by Hans Zimmer is truly amazing, and compliments the film brilliantly. It also isn't as heavy on drums as some of his previous scores, and there are some more memorable themes to be found here, which is great.While there are so many things in Man of Steel that delivered, there are some minor flaws that are worth pointing out. First of all, as stunning and incredible as the action scenes are at times, I found that they were a little exhausting towards the end. Again, the quality of the action scenes were amazing, but I felt as if they could have cut out a little bit of it in the end. Additionally, there is a point in the plot between where Clark leaves  Smallville and finds the Fortress of Solitude where he is job hopping while also saving people and developing as person. The scenes we are given here are amazing, but I wish we had more of them. There were maybe only two or three of these scenes throughout the film, and I thin that the film would have benefited a bit more from just a few more.However, these flaws, while significant, are more forgivable withe everything the film does right, as well as one thing that really makes Man of Steel a truly ballsy and incredible reboot: the ending. I won't spoil exactly what happens, but I will say that my reaction to it could be described only in one word: wow. It was incredible in my mind, and really did an amazing job at bringing closure to the story, exploring parts of Superman that hadn't been explored before, and also somehow bringing the lore back to familiar, yet fresh territory. It was amazing, and I couldn't think of a better way to end the film.All in all, while Man of Steel has minor flaws holding it back from perfection, it undoubtedly delivers on all fronts. Its fresh and exciting storytelling, stellar cast, beautiful action sequences, and fantastic new direction make Man of Steel one of the best movies of the year so far. The fantastic direction of this franchise makes Superman relatable and awesome again, and seeing one of the greatest comic book characters of all time in that stage again is truly remarkable. The amazing thing too is, while the film does leave open for the future, and the audience does want more, the film ultimately wraps up in incredible fashion, also leaving me entirely fulfilled and satisfied.Combine all of these elements, and you have a film that truly is, well, super. It is one of the best comic book movies of all time.",5,"""An ideal to strive towards...""",1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,12673,"['Superman', 'one', 'most', 'iconic', 'well', 'known', 'characters',

1561836,ADY1E4CAPP1W1,B008JFUPFI,LopsidedMidget,"[0, 3]","I really enjoyed man of steel and think that it's a great start to what can potentially be a very entertaining reboot of one of my favorite childhood superheros. With that said, I think the 3D aspect of this film was done terribly. I usually vet my 3D titles pretty thoroughly prior to buying them and wouldn't averagely just go out and purchase one on a whim. Alas, I did this with Man of Steel, figuring that it's pretty much the ideal movie for this medium. Boy, was I wrong! My feelings on each aspect of the film are as follows:Audio: 5/5This is one of the best parts of this film. I was thoroughly entertained as every aspect of the film was tied extremely well to sounds that surrounded you. The use of LFE, the surround speakers, and the score itself were all exceptionally fun to listen to and well implemented.3D: 1/5This was depressing. Just watch the 2D version and save yourself some money. The best 3D that you'll see throughout the entire movie is the title screen. This was a movie that was very obviously rushed or not geared towards 3D during the filming, and it shows. Most of the movie has a fatigued graininess to it that does not convert appropriately to a 3D setting. 3D requires sharp clean lines, Snyder went with an aged look for the filming method when scenes in the past are taking place and much of what would have added depth to a scene was intentionally made blurry for a 2D rendition. Simply put, I felt like I was watching a 2D movie with the 3D glasses on, and it took away from the experience. If I had watched it in 2D I'm fairly certain that the visuals would have been much better than what I got with 3D.Regarding the 3D: I do not only look for and gauge the 3D quality by the gimicky pop outs, but take depth into consideration. There are a few scenes in this movie that the 3D does benefit the movie, but they are few, far between, and insignificant to the bigger picture. Post conversion films are hit or miss when it comes to the quality of the conversion. This one was simply a miss.2D Version ?/5I will update this review once I have a chance to sit down for two hours to watch the 2D version of this film.Movie: 4/5A very enjoyable reboot of a series that has seen hard times. While this particular film seems to be hit or miss with a lot of people, I think that it sets the groundwork for future films that required a pretty solid base. I enjoyed how Snyder developed Superman's character and how he represented his ties to humanity, etc. I think the next (superman standalone) movie has a lot of potential.",4,"Good movie, but avoid the 3D version",1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,2554,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'man', 'steel', 'think', 'great', 'start', 'what', 'can', 'potentially', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'reboot', 'one', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'superheros', 'said', 'think', '3D', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'terribly', 'usually', 'vet', '3D', 'titles', 'pretty', 'thoroughly', 'prior', 'buying', 'would', ""n't"", 'averagely', 'just', 'go', 'out', 'purchase', 'one', 'whim', 'Alas', 'did', 'Man', 'Steel', 'figuring', 'pretty', 'much', 'ideal', 'movie', 'medium', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'feelings', 'aspect', 'film', 'are', 'Audio', '5/5This', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'tied', 'extremely', 'well', 'sounds', 'surrounded', 'use', 'LFE', 'surround', 'speakers', 'score', 'were', 'exceptionally', 'fun', 'listen', 'well', 'implemented.3D', '1/5This', 'was', 'depressing', 'Just', 'watch', '2D', 'version', 'save', 'money', 'best', '3D', ""'ll"", 'see', 'entire', 'movie', 'title', 'screen', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'obviously', 'rushed', 'not', 'geared', 'towards', '3D', 'filming', 'Most', 'movie', 'fatigued', 'graininess', 'not', 'convert', 'appropriately', '3D', 'setting', '3D', 'sharp', 'clean', 'lines', 'Snyder', 'went', 'aged', 'look', 'filming', 'method', 'when', 'scenes', 'past', 'are', 'taking', 'place', 'much', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'depth', 'scene', 'was', 'intentionally', 'made', 'blurry', '2D', 'rendition', 'Simply', 'put', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', '2D', 'movie', '3D', 'glasses', 'took', 'away', 'experience', 'had', 'watched', '2D', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'certain', 'visuals', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'got', '3D.Regarding', '3D', 'do', 'not', 'only', 'look', 'gauge', '3D', 'quality', 'gimicky', 'pop', 'outs', 'take', 'depth', 'consideration', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'movie', '3D', 'benefit', 'movie', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'insignificant', 'bigger', 'picture', 'Post', 'conversion', 'films', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'when', 'quality', 'conversion', 'one', 'was', 'simply', 'miss.2D', 'Version', '/5I', 'will', 'update', 'review', 'once', 'have', 'chance', 'sit', 'down', 'two', 'hours', 'watch', '2D', 'version', 'film.Movie', '4/5A', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'reboot', 'series', 'seen', 'hard', 'times', 'particular', 'film', 'be', 'hit', 'miss', 'lot', 'people', 'think', 'groundwork', 'future', 'films', 'required', 'pretty', 'solid', 'base', 'enjoyed', 'how', 'Snyder', 'developed', 'Superman', 'character', 'how', 'represented', 'ties', 'humanity', 'etc', 'think', 'next', 'superman', 'standalone', 'movie', 'lot', 'potential']",N/A

1561839,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B008JFUPFI,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[15, 35]","Zack Snyder (300, Watchman) did an honest job in trying to reinvent the franchise, however he fell short in the most important area, the story.  Man of Steel had no real plot that develops. I don't mind adjusting the lore (SPOILER: Jonathan Kent dies in a twister?), but above all else you need a story that engages me into the characters.  David S. Goyer (Threshold, Flashforward) story that was penned by himself and Synder lacked any real depth or for that matter originality.I am a huge Superman fan (from Kirk Allen to Dean Cain), and I could even appreciate the better points of Superman Returns a few years back with Brandon Routh as the alien from Krypton which also had major issues, but this film had no ""WOW"" Superman moments. It was like watching 300 (nothing but fighting) meets Transformers (hard to follow who was hitting who) meets Cloverfield (the camera shook even on the most intimate close-ups) meets the remake of Godzilla (what's the point?).Now, the good things I saw were actually for once Russell Crowe (Gladiator, Les Miserables) was properly cast as the father of Kal El (Superman), Jor El. Although a short part, his pushy nature of guiding his son as well as the earthlings seem every sincere and more so on the scenes where he puts his baby son in the spaceship that takes him to a strange new world.Okay, Henry Cavill (The Immortals, Stardust) does an honest attempt at playing the American Icon even though he is British. He seems sincere in his convictions and honest to the character. Defiantly a good looking man, but again he as an actor and as a character had very little to stretch his acting muscles on.Amy Adams (Enchanted, Monster) as Lois Lane, although small in part is always a delight to watch. Once again, she didn't have a lot to work with, but what she did with what she had was good. Amy is a far more talented performer than what they gave her to do here in the movie. Another good, short but memorable performance came from Christopher Maloni (Oz, Law & Order) who plays a military sergeant who is the first one to believe and trust in Superman besides Lois of course, weirdly enough.Kevin Costner (Dances With Wolves, The Untouchables) as Jonathan Kent and Diane Lane (Perfect Storm, Jumper) as Martha Kent were perfectly cast if not for the re-inventing of the famed Superman lore. Diane was amazing sincere and real while Costner was the most fatherly I have ever seen him perform.General Zod played like a punked up with steroids version of Adam Ant was performed by Michael Shannon (Take Shelter, The Iceman). Although he looked menacing and shouted well, he didn't have the gravitas as an actor to play the broadly proud and menacing personality that is the character. He just came off like a big bully with special powers. Weak of spirit of conviction  if strong in his efforts of pointless violence.The film is too dark to be a Superman film. It is not triumphant and proud and downplays the grandeur of what the American Icon has always represented. I hope Synder does not direct the sequel if there is one and coupled with the gloomy cinematography Amir Mokri (Pacific Heights, Queen's Logic), the not so interesting redesigning of the costumes by Michael Wilkinson (Sucker Punch, 300) and the bold and broad but un-heroic score of Hans Zimmer (The Lion king, Pirates of the Caribbean ), I really hope it doesn't destroy the DC Line of super heroes. Although The dark Knight series did okay (Heath Leadger in the second was my favorite even without Batman in it), I just wish that kids could walk out of Superhero movies these days feeling like a superhero themselves and having fun. Like the Avengers film! There were no claps, cheers, boos or applauds during this film. Superman Return's had that and I won't begin to mention the standing cheers of crowds at Christopher Reeve's Superman: The Movie directed by Richard Donner.  I was more than disappointed and I was really looking forward to this one!

Cavill makes a decent Clark/Kal-El (""Superman"" isn't acknowledged in the end titles), and Diane Lane acquits herself nicely as Martha Kent, but Amy Adams is an awful Lois (Lois Lame might be a more appropriate name for her character), and Laurence Fishburne's Perry White (complete with earring! ) is more Frank Langella than Jackie Cooper.  The one casting choice I had high hopes for was Michael Shannon as Zod, and while he brings a great deal of menace to the proceedings, he lacks the calm, cool confidence of Terence Stamp's interpretation.  Perhaps modern audiences expect their villains to be over-the-top bad asses with no shades of grey, and if that's the case, then this new Zod delivers.  Christoper Meloni, one of my favourite LAW & ORDER actors, has a nice supporting role as an army officer.But my main quibble with the film is the way it approaches the action sequences.  Perhaps I'm out of step with the times, but I don't see the point in making a SUPERMAN movie where it's painfully obvious all the actors are standing in front of a green screen and the ""epic"" digital action is out of focus and cut with attention deficit sufferers in mind.  When Christopher Reeve played Superman, you could actually see his derring-do whereas in MAN OF STEEL the action is cut so quickly you have to guess.  Also, the Kryptonian architects were most definitely inspired by H.R. Giger this time out, so it's little wonder Jor-El and the Missus had no interest in raising a child in such a dark and uninviting environment.

1561852,A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY,B008JFUPFI,MacheteJason,"[14, 25]","*SPOILER WARNING*Man of Steel was good but not great. Heavy emphasis on special effects with a thin story. Reeve's portrayal remains superior though Cavill is convincing as Kal-El (being given more lines might have helped him even more). Cavill did come across as a true pro in the marketing interviews for this film and that counts for a lot. Most but not all of the performances are good. This seems like a remake of Superman: The Movie and Superman II. This slightly different take on the Superman mythology sees Superman discarding his dual identity so don't expect him to be jumping back and forth as Clark Kent (who appears only in the final seconds). Lex Luthor, Otis and Jimmy Olsen are missing. The scene of old Pa Kent (Kevin Costner) dying is particularly irksome and laughable as he is engulfed in a slow-moving tornado while he yells at Young Clark who stands ""helpless"" nearby. Some of the backstory is also changed from Krypton ""reversing its axis"" to a civil war/resource shortage. Admittedly Crowe does a good job as Superman's biological dad but it's hard to forget he is Russell Crowe. Loved certain touches, such as Young Clark reading Plato. The movie plays out in flashback sequences of Young Clark. Those tend to be the best scenes.Superman's traveling name is only mentioned once or twice and I don't recall Metropolis being mentioned at all. There isn't much to describe in the way of plot development because they don't advance the story beyond a sci-fi alien invasion theme with lots of punches thrown by both sides. Information content is lower than the original (we see more but we don't learn much more). So we don't get as close to the characters since it's mostly Transformers meets Total Recall-like action. The whimsical fun of the original films and comic books is tossed here in favor of a darker Superman which almost works but is not explored sufficiently. The downside is that Superman doesn't seem so super without his powers (it seems to be an attempt to make Superman more ""human"" or real with some but not all of his powers). As a ""Superman spinoff"" it does work well. This is an attempt to re-invigorate the crown jewel of superhero franchises. It is admittedly much better than Superman Returns and the action works for what it is. Visually it looks good with the costumes and CGI but Superman is turned into a sci-fi/boxing story. So forget about all the tall buildings, locomotives and cats to rescue because Kal-El has important work to do. It's worth checking out but it's no ""Dark Knight"" so fans of the franchise are warned. Christopher Nolan lent his name to this work as a producer/writer but don't expect to see his stamp of Batman panache here. Zack Snyder directed Man of Steel and the impressive Dawn of the Dead remake. He does the best he can with the material. The focus on explosions and action allows the CGI to take over. The result is that few of the scenes have any magic. Things just happen. Superman getting arrested was used heavily in the promotions but he is quickly released so it lacks credibility, purpose and plot development. Clark getting beat up by some bully and flying in to save the day in Superman II makes a lot more sense. An amazing score and soundtrack is also missing.Forget about chemistry between the characters because it's mainly green screen stuff. Most are in their own world. Doesn't look like General Zod was in the same room as the rest of the cast. Zod indicates ""I'm taking over now"" before he is captured 21 seconds later and sent off-world. So they introduced him to set-up the CGI and go 12 rounds with Kal-El? Man of Steel tries too hard to be convincing (""this could really happen"") but it feels restrained as if Superman flying and acting super would turn movie buffs off. It's science fiction and fantasy so why not make it imaginative and dramatic? Box office estimates indicated Man of Steel would gross over $1 billion but it looks like that was optimistic.

The opening scenes on Krypton are beautifully realized and the designs are reminiscent of H.R. Giger for those who have followed his career (i.e., Alien, etc.). The fluid metal technology which recalled Terminator 2 was also especially cool.The middle dragged a bit but the final action scenes go on seemingly forever and are absolutely spectacular and intense.A few plot elements don't seem to make much sense (such as General Zod wanting to transform earth into Krypton which would nullify their superpowers, also mentioned by other reviewers here), but what the heck, it's a movie based on a comic-book character so I don't expect a Vulcan level of logical consistency. It's just plain rock 'em sock 'em fun as God-like super-humans decide to stage the ultimate fight between good and evil with our little rock of a planet as the battlefield.Cast was excellent overall even if the script wasn't always stellar, but again, it's a comic book based movie and I don't expect Madame Bovary. If I want that I can always read Madame Bovary. No thanks, Les Miserables at over 1000 pages by Victor Hugo was enough for me.It was also good to see Kevin Costner as Superboy's father. The leading man roles he commanded in the 80s and 90s are now long gone, but he does a fine job as Superboy's father who must mentor a very unusual son.So overall a very visually exciting and action-packed movie that delivers a lot of bang for your buck.",4,A bit uneven but very intense overall,1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,1490,"['Great', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'are', 'high', 'points', 'MOS', 'opening', 'scenes', 'Krypton', 'are', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'designs', 'are', 'reminiscent', 'H.R', 'Giger', 'who', 'have', 'followed', 'career', 'i.e.', 'Alien', 'etc.', 'fluid', 'metal', 'technology', 'recalled', 'Terminator', '2', 'was', 'also', 'especially', 'cool.The', 'middle', 'dragged', 'bit', 'final', 'action', 'scenes', 'go', 'seemingly', 'forever', 'are', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', 'intense.A', 'few', 'plot', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'such', 'General', 'Zod', 'wanting', 'transform', 'earth', 'Krypton', 'would', 'nullify', 'superpowers', 'also', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'what', 'heck', 'movie', 'based', 'comic-book', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Vulcan', 'level', 'logical', 'consistency', 'just', 'plain', 'rock', 'sock', 'fun', 'God-like', 'super-humans', 'decide', 'stage', 'ultimate', 'fight', 'good', 'evil', 'little', 'rock', 'planet', 'battlefield.Cast', 'was', 'excellent', 'overall', 'even', 'script', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'stellar', 'again', 'comic', 'book', 'based', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Madame', 'Bovary', 'want', 'can', 'always', 'read', 'Madame', 'Bovary', 'No', 'thanks', 'Les', 'Miserables', '1000', 'pages', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'was', 'enough', 'me.It', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'see', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Superboy', 'father', 'leading', 'man', 'commanded', '80s', '90s', 'are', 'now', 'long', 'gone', 'fine', 'job', 'Superboy', 'father', 'who', 'must', 'mentor', 'very', 'unusual', 'son.So', 'very', 'visually', 'exciting', 'action-packed', 'movie', 'lot', 'bang', 'buck']",N/A

There was too much change when compared to the original story and I might have considered it more worthy if they just created a totally new superhero. Maybe Alien man since Krypton and their ships reminded you of something you'd see on the movie ""Alien.""Also it was entirely TOO LONG.  The fight scenes were one big blur and you rarely knew where they were actually fighting. The ""Finding Myself"" time of Superman was also TOO LONG. There was all of this focus on the inner Superman and all it did was make one feel like you knew him less and there was this vibe of his depression etc.Superman is suppose to be about action, love and heart. Not Superman's inner state. Especially since the character hasn't been fully developed yet. People cared about Christopher Reeves rendition bc it was a slow build like a peeling effect. First starts off awkward, wants to show off, angry for not doing more, exploratory and traveler, back to geek, funny and comical at times, to hero savior, to man in love, to man being depressed bc he can't be w Lois. It took awhile bf the depressed state came and all of his insecurities were brought to the forefront.And that's what's missing from most of the new Superman movies.Also Krypton originally was an ice planet. Not a desert land. It also had no dinosaurs on the planet.Hated that he allowed his dad to die in tornado. He cud have blurred his way through the debris and saved him like on Smallville.Didn't understand why they didn't just have Jonathan to die of a heart attack like before. That's more realistic that he Wudnt be able to save him. Not the tornado part.The major major big turn off of the film is that nearly everyone knows or could easily find out who he is since his classmates and the town saw him save them from drowning in a river.Lois was even able to track him down to the Kent farm to find out about his spaceship. This isn't how they first met. And plus it takes away from the build up effect.Also at the end of the movie he decides to go incognito wearing his eyeglasses and supposedly Lois doesn't know who he is even though he has the same last name as Superman which is Kent. She tracked him down. And he didn't kiss her to make her forget.Overall this was a bizarre film.The only parts I liked was the explaining Zod's side or reason for him becoming a moron. Also liked the film telling what happened after Clark left his mother and went traveling along the way to meet his shadow father who should have taught him for 12 years if you go by Christopher Reeves rendition.

Actually it's beyond disappointment...I hated this film and what they did to the hero I grew up with.  This is of course a personal opinion only...a lot of folks liked the film and who am I tell them they are wrong?There wasn't one redeeming quality about it at all, well maybe one.  I didn't give a crap about any of the characters including Superman.  The dialogue must have been written by the same people who wrote ""The Brady Bunch,"" especially Kevin Costner's dialogue.  There is absolutely no warmth or emotional attachment between any of the characters, even between Clark and his earthly mother, Diane Lane who played Martha Kent.  Even the make-up was terrible; the older Martha Kent looked more like a crack addict than matriarchal.The tornado scene was absolutely ridiculous.  Why didn't Clark rescue the dog?  He could have easily done it without giving away his secret.  Instead he lets his father push him away pretty much knowing dad is a goner.  And did I miss something, didn't Lois Lane and everyone else already know that the alien was Clark Kent from Nebraska, so what was with the ending?  And what was with the suite?  There was no explanation why there was a suite or why it had those colors or anything, it just happens to appear on a ship, put there by the dead Krypto father 20,000 years ago.  How fast Lois and Clark became an item?  The casual way earth accepted the news about alien life?  How quickly Lois and the scientist were able to understand, interchange, interconnect, blah blah General Zod's ship's drive field with Clark's baby ship's drive field blah blah and send everyone except Zod back to the Phantom Zone?

1561871,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B008JFUPFI,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[28, 80]","This film is caught up in a whole set of rather odd philosophical ideas that are somewhat pervasive in modern culture. The primary one being the religion of the alien.The religion of the alien presupposes the coming of the ""alien"" savior who will banish all human ideology and religion by only their presence. Reason and ""science"" will conquer all and the aliens will guide humanity to its rightful place as gods. Strength is the ultimate morality and what is to be worshipped. The unworthy, clinging to the failed past, will attempt to kill the alien savior but will fail.David S. Goyer takes it a step further by grafting a sort of philosophical darwinism on the top of. A philosophical darwinism where there are ""winners"" and ""losers"". There are those who follow the path upward and there are who do not. Those who do not follow the path upward don't simply make themselves extinct, but must (apparently) be made extinct by their betters.Krypton deserved extinction for turning its back on genetic evolution as well as the battle for Lebensraum out in the universe. But under the careful protection of Superman, that mistake will not be made on Earth.The is an odd basis for a superman film. But this is where we are in 2013.The film starts out with a dying planet (Krypton) which is dying seemingly for turning its back on progress, expansion and genetic evolution. The politicians do nothing. The military tries to preserve the status quo. But the father of little superman seems to see their destruction as a moral judgement. They must all die so that the path upward can begin again but only through HIS son of course. No small irony in Jor-El attacking Zod over choosing bloodlines when he decides that only HIS son should survive.Young superman comes to earth. Then the survivors of his people come after him. After a whole lot of pointless overly destructive fighting, Superman makes an active decision to carry out the genocide of his own people. The film doesn't dwell on the awful moral nature of that decision or the questionable reasoning behind it. Humanity will be led forward by its new shephard and the fate of those not moving forward is to be made extinct. Though each side has what the other needs, there can be no negotiation or second thoughts. Its a pure darwinian struggle between those who will survive and those who will be made extinct.The film then degenerates into a pointless excess of destructive violence. The excess makes it all very uninteresting. Its a very boring fight that ends in a very predictable way. Superman fights without a second thought to the consequences of his actions. He destroys his home town. He destroys the city center of Metropolis. He never even makes an attempt to take the fighting away from places where many, many people will die. If someone in front of him is to be killed, it somehow matters. But the deaths of thousands of people who can't be seen in front of him are not worth a second thought.The film could have been rather emotional had Zod actually made the accusation of Genocide and talked of bringing Superman to justice before their final fight. But the film always repairs its moral shortcomings by making Zod irrationally homicidal toward humans. Even when he supposed to be angry beyond words at Superman, killing a few humans always seems the higher priority.In terms of disguisting ideas, the only thing I can compare it to is ""300"" which is not exactly ironic considering that they share the same director. Oddly enough, many of ideas are also a ""blowing up"" of the ideas of the Dark Knight from the scale of a city to the scale of a world: the lone orphan sacrificing himself to become a sort of civilizational avatar. The overtly fascist undercurrent in all these ideas is somewhat disturbing.Michael Shannon gives by far the best performance in the film. He escapes from the shadow of Terence Stamp and makes the character his own. Kevin Costner plays his predictable character actor role. Russell Crowe appears to have prepared by watching Star Wars Films.Henry Cavill looks the part but is given almost nothing to do as an actor. I cant think of a single memorable scene with him. Laurence Fishburne was trying to be Ed Bradley rather than do a fictional character role and is in far too many scenes in which he was not needed.Its not a bad film technically. But its philosophy is horrible and the whole urban alien invasion thing has been done to death in films.

Superman (inner and outer) searches for the answers to:  How can I use my talents and strength?  What's my place in this world?  Who am I?  What do I follow?  In other words, this is more than a rescue fantasy for the young and old.  Before working for the newspaper, we see superman as a waiter and a truck driver.Zod saying that he was raised to be aggressive reminds me of a story I once heard  about a woman who experienced a lot of betrayal in her life.  One day upon hearing that she was pregnant decided to groom her child to grow up and take revenge on others so that the mother could vicariously take pleasure in his behaviour.  Decades later, in therapy, the daughter told her therapist that she felt like her mother's weapon and that she disliked people and wanted to heal.  Zod, in order to receive his mother's love, most likely had to accept his mother's wishes. I think a clue to this phenomenon occurs at the very beginning of the movie when superman, just after being born, was told by his parents, ""Our hopes and dreams go with you.""  The intention and context is different but the idea is there that parents have wishes for their children.  What (un)conscious beliefs might a child pick up from their parents?

I have to say Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan have done the Man of Steel perfectly. The new way of looking at Superman they have given us is a great adaptation and addition to his story. The way the movie was shot is amazing, the way they incorporate flash backs to help us understand the back story in a fast and detailed way is miraculous. Some will say this movie was horrible in the way that the story is or how Superman is portrayed, but you have to keep in mind that several dozen writers across the decades have written countless stories and their own adaptations of the Krytponian hero, and this is no exception. Zack Snyder made Man of Steel his own version of Superman, while still sticking to the basic story of him.If you are a fan of the Dark Knight Trilogy then definitely pick this up! Obviously the same staff and company made Man of Steel, and the artistic style and storylines are similar. In my book, this is the best Superman movie out there, even the Chris Reeves ones. Henry Cavill brings a great acting style and new life to Superman that is very welcomed. The only downfall to this movie is the fact that it was a slow start (even though I thoroughly enjoyed this, many may not) then a huge fight for the last third of the movie.

There is nothing ""campy"" in this film and that is ok by me.  The film opens with the birth of Kal-el on Krypton.  His father has hidden Ka-el's birth because he is the first natural birth to happen in a few hundred years.  Like the book Brave New World all babies are born in a laboratory and conditioned to have specific careers.  As Krypton is in its last days Kal-el's parents want him to start Krypton over with ""free choice"" on the Earth.General Zod learns what the els have done and comes to steal Kal-el.  He and his forces arrive a minute too late as Lara has sent her son to the heavens in a ship bound for Earth.  Zod kills El and gets ready to intercept Kal-el's ship but he and his forces are caught and are exiled to the Phantom Zone.  Shortly after Krypton self destructs.We see an adult Kal-el on Earth using varous identies and going from place to place (like David Banner in the old Incredible Hulk tv series) each time someone suspects something about him.  He has several flashbacks to growing up under the tutelage of Jonathan Kent who kept telling him that nobody must know of his special abilites because he will be feared.He will later learn of his Krypton birth and will discover an ancient outpost where he can insert a special key that was sent with him in the ship by his Krypton father.  This key activiates the ancient outpost with a holographic image of his father complete with his father's memories.  He will also be provided the costume that we have come ot know.Of course the baddies led by Zod will escape the Phantom Zone and learn where Kal-el is living and come to threaten Earth.  It will be up to Kal-el to make some serious decisions.  Does he defend his Earth identity and the only planet that he knows or should he go with Zod and further his plans for a new Krypton.This movie is filled with a lot of inner turmoil and like Bruce Wayne in the Nolan Dark Knight films, Kal-el must dig deep down and figure out who he is and what he wants to be.  Lois Lane is also in the film and she tries to help Kal-el with solving his identity.  She is on thin ice with her newspaper and her editor (played brilliantly by Larry Fisbourne).  I thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish.  Some people complained that the special effects and fight scenes were overdone.  I did not get that but maybe because I only saw the 2D version.My only complaint is that Lois Lane seemed to be able to get to places quickly that maybe she shouldn't have been able to get to.  As weveral people have mentioned, we do so a fuel truck with ""LexCorp"" on it so maybe a sequel is in the works with a very familiar Superman foe.",4,"A ""Darker"" Superman Works Well As A Film!",1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,2772,"['who', 'remember', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'campy', 'Superman', 'films', '1970', 'can', 'forget', 'anything', 'saw', 'films', 'nothing', 'campy', 'film', 'ok', 'film', 'birth', 'Kal-el', 'Krypton', 'father', 'hidden', 'Ka-el', 'birth', 'first', 'natural', 'birth', 'happen', 'few', 'hundred', 'years', 'book', 'Brave', 'New', 'World', 'babies', 'are', 'born', 'laboratory', 'conditioned', 'have', 'specific', 'careers', 'Krypton', 'last', 'days', 'Kal-el', 'parents', 'want', 'start', 'Krypton', 'free', 'choice', 'Earth.General', 'Zod', 'what', 'els', 'have', 'done', 'steal', 'Kal-el', 'forces', 'arrive', 'minute', 'too', 'late', 'Lara', 'sent', 'son', 'heavens', 'ship', 'bound', 'Earth', 'Zod', 'El', 'ready', 'intercept', 'Kal-el', 'ship', 'forces', 'are', 'caught', 'are', 'exiled', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'Shortly', 'Krypton', 'self', 'destructs.We', 'see', 'adult', 'Kal-el', 'Earth', 'using', 'varous', 'identies', 'going', 'place', 'place', 'David', 'Banner', 'old', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'tv', 'series', 'time', 'someone', 'something', 'several', 'flashbacks', 'growing', 'up', 'tutelage', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'who', 'kept', 'telling', 'nobody', 'must', 'know', 'special', 'abilites', 'will', 'be', 'feared.He', 'will', 'later', 'learn', 'Krypton', 'birth', 'will', 'discover', 'ancient', 'outpost', 'where', 'can', 'insert', 'special', 'key', 'was', 'sent', 'ship', 'Krypton', 'father', 'key', 'ancient', 'outpost', 'holographic', 'image', 'father', 'complete', 'father', 'memories', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'provided', 'costume', 'have', 'come', 'ot', 'know.Of', 'course', 'baddies', 'led', 'Zod', 'will', 'escape', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'learn', 'where', 'Kal-el', 'living', 'come', 'threaten', 'Earth', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'Kal-el', 'make', 'serious', 'decisions', 'defend', 'Earth', 'identity', 'only', 'planet', 'should', 'go', 'Zod', 'further', 'plans', 'new', 'Krypton.This', 'movie', 'filled', 'lot', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'films', 'Kal-el', 'must', 'dig', 'deep', 'down', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'what', 'be', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'also', 'film', 'help', 'Kal-el', 'solving', 'identity', 'thin', 'ice', 'newspaper', 'editor', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Larry', 'Fisbourne', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'people', 'complained', 'special', 'effects', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'overdone', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'maybe', 'only', 'saw', '2D', 'version.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'seemed', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'places', 'quickly', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'able', 'get', 'weveral', 'people', 'have', 'mentioned', 'do', 'so', 'fuel', 'truck', 'LexCorp', 'so', 'maybe', 'sequel', 'works', 'very', 'familiar', 'Superman', 'foe']",N/A

Again, it made me *think* and not be caught up in waves of sentimentality of this is not how the first Superman movie played out.

1561908,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B008JFUPFI,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[9, 16]","It's hard to remake Superman these days. Batman taps into the deep psyche of vigilantism that has always haunted America, but Superman has come to embody a 1950s-style ideal of innocence  that many feel no longer applies in a cynical modern world.  Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer came up with a simple solution. Just show Superman the way we would see him today.And the reality of ""Man of Steel"" is that Superman is terrifying.  He is all-powerful, all-knowing, and he lives among us.  He is, in essence, the ultimate terrorist.  Is it any wonder America doesn't accept him at first?With that perspective in mind, ""Man of Steel"" does what other superhero movies have failed to do (I'm looking at you, ""Green Lantern""), and that's present a superhero in a realistic fashion.  Kal-El AKA Superman AKA Clark Kent (Heny Cavill) is literally Krypton's last hope, but he's also a wanderer, a cipher, and yes a hero.  Sprinkled throughout ""Man of Steel"" is flashbacks to the difficulty of growing up as an alien pretending to be a human, shepherded by Martha (Diane Lane) and Jonathan (Kevin Costner) Kent. Both of Superman's father figures haunt him figuratively and literally to shape who Superman was, is, and will be. It's compelling stuff.But this is a Superman movie, not a Batman movie, so the potential for world-shaking destruction is never far away. In fact, the level of destruction reaches uncomfortable levels -- those of us affected by 9/11 will find those wounds reopened in the face of superheroes blithely ignoring the massive casualties around them.  It's all filmed with a shaky-cam (tinged by the occasional faux lens flare), demonstrating just what Superman would look like exceeding the speed of sound.""Man of Steel"" takes the Superman story and makes logical connections. Lois Lane (plucky Amy Adams) is the logical person to track down the alien -- not because of her sassy attitude but because she's a good reporter tracking down a lead.  Superman doesn't just decide to put on a cape -- he wears a mantle of leadership he willingly embraces. And when Superman comes face-to-face with Zod (Michael Shannon), he's staring down the regimented hierarchy of his past.Goyer and Nolan have pulled of a believable Superman by making him a scary possibility to face.  And yet Superman is woefully unprepared for his role as world savior -- as Zod is fond of pointing out, he's just a farm boy -- or is he? Superman's reintroduced to the DC film universe leaves Metropolis and Smallville irrevocably changed.  And if the other movies planned in the shared universe are any indication, hopefully for the better.",5,Terrifying,1372377600,"06 28, 2013",2013,2625,"['hard', 'remake', 'Superman', 'days', 'Batman', 'deep', 'psyche', 'vigilantism', 'always', 'haunted', 'America', 'Superman', 'come', 'embody', '1950s-style', 'ideal', 'innocence', 'many', 'feel', 'no', 'longer', 'applies', 'cynical', 'modern', 'world', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'David', 'S.', 'Goyer', 'came', 'up', 'simple', 'solution', 'Just', 'show', 'Superman', 'way', 'would', 'see', 'today.And', 'reality', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Superman', 'terrifying', 'all-powerful', 'all-knowing', 'essence', 'ultimate', 'terrorist', 'wonder', 'America', ""n't"", 'accept', 'first', 'perspective', 'mind', 'Man', 'Steel', 'what', 'other', 'superhero', 'movies', 'have', 'failed', 'do', ""'m"", 'looking', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'present', 'superhero', 'realistic', 'fashion', 'Kal-El', 'AKA', 'Superman', 'AKA', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Heny', 'Cavill', 'literally', 'Krypton', 'last', 'hope', 'also', 'wanderer', 'cipher', 'yes', 'hero', 'Sprinkled', 'Man', 'Steel', 'flashbacks', 'difficulty', 'growing', 'up', 'alien', 'pretending', 'be', 'human', 'shepherded', 'Martha', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Jonathan', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Kent', 'Superman', 'father', 'figures', 'haunt', 'figuratively', 'literally', 'shape', 'who', 'Superman', 'was', 'will', 'be', 'compelling', 'stuff.But', 'Superman', 'movie', 'not', 'Batman', 'movie', 'potential', 'world-shaking', 'destruction', 'never', 'far', 'away', 'fact', 'level', 'destruction', 'reaches', 'uncomfortable', 'levels', 'affected', '9/11', 'will', 'find', 'wounds', 'reopened', 'face', 'superheroes', 'blithely', 'ignoring', 'massive', 'casualties', 'filmed', 'shaky-cam', 'tinged', 'occasional', 'faux', 'lens', 'flare', 'demonstrating', 'just', 'what', 'Superman', 'would', 'look', 'exceeding', 'speed', 'sound', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Superman', 'story', 'logical', 'connections', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'plucky', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'logical', 'person', 'track', 'down', 'alien', 'not', 'sassy', 'attitude', 'good', 'reporter', 'tracking', 'down', 'lead', 'Superman', ""n't"", 'just', 'decide', 'put', 'cape', 'mantle', 'leadership', 'willingly', 'when', 'Superman', 'face-to-face', 'Zod', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'staring', 'down', 'regimented', 'hierarchy', 'past.Goyer', 'Nolan', 'have', 'pulled', 'believable', 'Superman', 'making', 'scary', 'possibility', 'face', 'yet', 'Superman', 'woefully', 'unprepared', 'role', 'world', 'savior', 'Zod', 'fond', 'pointing', 'out', 'just', 'farm', 'boy', 'Superman', 'reintroduced', 'DC', 'film', 'universe', 'Metropolis', 'Smallville', 'irrevocably', 'changed', 'other', 'movies', 'planned', 'shared', 'universe', 'are', 'indication', 'hopefully', 'better']",N/A

From start to finish is an engrossing movie experience that has a wonderful balance of story and action. Christopher Nolan's hand in this movie is very evident. Like Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy Man of Steel is a dark and serious movie start to finish. The movie is driven by story and action and there are very few comedic moments in this movie. And thankfully there's very little romance in this movie. Like Batman Begins and the 2009 Star Trek Man of Steel ignores prior movies in the series and is portrayed as a beginning story. The tension between Jor-el and Zod and Later Superman and Zod is palpable. The acting in this film was wonderful and the characters well performed and convincing. Then there's the story itself. The struggle for self identity story Clark Kent goes through once on earth is very human and very well written. The human element is much more present in this film than in Superman Returns. The more notable presence of the human element and a much better story make this film soar above Superman Returns. Nolan's plot has brought some of the brilliance the Dark Knight trilogy gave the Batman series and brought it to the Superman series. And Zack Snyder's directing gave us a wonderful action movie. The action in this movie is flat out awesome and far superior to the action in Superman Returns. The special effects and visuals are right on. Intense and realistic but not overdone. Man of Steel's wonderful balance of story and action and lack of romance make it an extremely satisfying movie. Both Superman fans and general audiences should love Man of Steel.

1561926,A1NX50T5CBEZ1G,B008JFUPFI,Minutemarch,"[9, 27]","I really really wanted to like this film.  I so wanted Superman to received a movie worthy of his enduring affection in the public eye (and in mine).  I came out of Man of Steel wishing it had been made by someone else and hoping there will be no sequel produced by this team.Why?  To be honest I think they were embarrassed by their subject matter.  The word ""Superman"" is barely mentioned.  His colours are muted and strong attempts are made to turn the Man of Steel into the Son of God.  (He's 33 years old.  He's been wandering in the wilderness.  He's a powerful being hiding among men with the requisite beard.  His scenes with his adoptive parents reinforce the image).  To be honest I highly doubt his Jewish creators intended him to be Jesus but apparently super-powered Jesus is less embarrassing than Superman to Nolan and co.  Not to mention the fact the thing is as serious as a sermon.  There is little-to-no fun to be had here with only a moment of joy when the young Supes flies for the first time and a couple of clever bits of business, mostly involving Russell Crowe.If you know the Superman story there are no surprises and it's retold here (twice over in case the 30 minute prologue didn't do it for you).  To me it felt like going down a list and checking off element after element.  The editing was awkward, jarring at times.  The music was lifted straight out of Inception (though I don't blame Zimmer.  Who could find much fresh inspiration in the awkward and perfunctory script?)  It was almost as if the movie wasn't made for earth at all but for distribution to some far-away planet where no one knew anything about Superman.  It's a primer, a beginning.  It fills in but it has very little to say, especially if you know anything about Superman going into it.There is an emotional story to be told with Superman but it wasn't told here. I didn't feel a thing aside from an uncomfortable boredom.It wasn't all bad.  There were a few effective scenes.  I especially loved the cleverly orchestrated escape from a certain Kryptonian vessel, assisted by an effectively played holographic blast from the past.  I also liked that they found a much more interesting way to handicap Supes than throwing Kyrptonite at him.  The way the interloper's powers developed as they went along was also a nice idea.  There are even nods to Wayne Enterprises and Luthorcorp.  There was potential but the heart of the thing was in the wrong place.The cast were good, certainly very (very) earnest.Superman/Clark himself was a blank slate, low on personality, but that was more due to the clumsy script than Cavill's efforts.  Zod was angry and driven (and that's it).  Lois was bold and curious (though used in a very contrived way).  Everyone was just as you'd expect if Superman was a joyless franchise.Colour is desaturated as if Metroplis has been mistaken for Gotham City and Superman, who risked exposure for a handful of kids on a bus at one point, is knocking down sky-scrapers without a care in the overly-long fight scenes that make up the second part of the film, apparently giving no thought to the civilian population (Also known as Acting Out of Character).Nolan may get Batman but he doesn't appear to get Superman and I am not sure he minds.  Batman was made for love. I left feeling Man of Steel was made for money.  Nolan doesn't know how to come at his subject matter.  He doesn't know that you can be a little silly so long as you give Superman a real challenge and some balance.  Superman is good, he's almost too good, and if he isn't tempered he can be dry and dull.  He can be a Sunday sermon, an overpowered boy scout, and little more.  (Perhaps Nolan should have watch Captain America: the First Avenger to get some ideas on how to give a spirited treatment to a slightly hokey ideal).In Nolan's Gotham there was more fun to be had than in its less oppressive sister city.  After sitting through this joyless retelling I firmly believe there is something wrong with that.So I will keep waiting for the Man of Steel to truly take flight and rise again.",2,Heart of steel,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,4085,"['really', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'so', 'wanted', 'Superman', 'received', 'movie', 'worthy', 'enduring', 'affection', 'public', 'eye', 'mine', 'came', 'Man', 'Steel', 'wishing', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'someone', 'else', 'hoping', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', 'produced', 'team.Why', 'be', 'honest', 'think', 'were', 'embarrassed', 'subject', 'matter', 'word', 'Superman', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'colours', 'are', 'muted', 'strong', 'attempts', 'are', 'made', 'turn', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Son', 'God', '33', 'years', 'old', 'been', 'wandering', 'wilderness', 'powerful', 'being', 'hiding', 'men', 'requisite', 'beard', 'scenes', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'reinforce', 'image', 'be', 'honest', 'highly', 'doubt', 'Jewish', 'creators', 'intended', 'be', 'Jesus', 'apparently', 'super-powered', 'Jesus', 'less', 'embarrassing', 'Superman', 'Nolan', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'thing', 'as', 'serious', 'sermon', 'little-to-no', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'only', 'moment', 'joy', 'when', 'young', 'Supes', 'flies', 'first', 'time', 'couple', 'clever', 'bits', 'business', 'mostly', 'involving', 'Russell', 'Crowe.If', 'know', 'Superman', 'story', 'are', 'surprises', 'retold', 'here', 'twice', 'case', '30', 'minute', 'prologue', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'felt', 'going', 'down', 'list', 'checking', 'off', 'element', 'element', 'editing', 'was', 'awkward', 'jarring', 'times', 'music', 'was', 'lifted', 'straight', 'Inception', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Zimmer', 'Who', 'could', 'find', 'much', 'fresh', 'inspiration', 'awkward', 'perfunctory', 'script', 'was', 'almost', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'earth', 'distribution', 'far-away', 'planet', 'where', 'one', 'knew', 'anything', 'Superman', 'primer', 'beginning', 'very', 'little', 'say', 'especially', 'know', 'anything', 'Superman', 'going', 'emotional', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'Superman', 'was', ""n't"", 'told', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'thing', 'aside', 'uncomfortable', 'boredom.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'were', 'few', 'effective', 'scenes', 'especially', 'loved', 'cleverly', 'orchestrated', 'escape', 'certain', 'Kryptonian', 'vessel', 'assisted', 'effectively', 'played', 'holographic', 'blast', 'past', 'also', 'liked', 'found', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'way', 'handicap', 'Supes', 'throwing', 'Kyrptonite', 'way', 'interloper', 'powers', 'developed', 'went', 'along', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'idea', 'are', 'even', 'nods', 'Wayne', 'Enterprises', 'Luthorcorp', 'was', 'potential', 'heart', 'thing', 'was', 'wrong', 'place.The', 'cast', 'were', 'good', 'certainly', 'very', 'very', 'earnest.Superman/Clark', 'was', 'blank', 'slate', 'low', 'personality', 'was', 'more', 'due', 'clumsy', 'script', 'Cavill', 'efforts', 'Zod', 'was', 'angry', 'driven', 'Lois', 'was', 'bold', 'curious', 'used', 'very', 'contrived', 'way', 'Everyone', 'was', 'just', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Superman', 'was', 'joyless', 'franchise.Colour', 'desaturated', 'Metroplis', 'been', 'mistaken', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Superman', 'who', 'risked', 'exposure', 'handful', 'kids', 'bus', 'one', 'point', 'knocking', 'down', 'sky-scrapers', 'care', 'overly-long', 'fight', 'scenes', 'make', 'up', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'apparently', 'giving', 'thought', 'civilian', 'population', 'Also', 'known', 'Acting', 'Character', '.Nolan', 'may', 'get', 'Batman', ""n't"", 'appear', 'get', 'Superman', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'Batman', 'was', 'made', 'love', 'left', 'feeling', 'Man', 'Steel', 'was', 'made', 'money', 'Nolan', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'come', 'subject', 'matter', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'silly', 'so', 'long', 'give', 'Superman', 'real', 'challenge', 'balance', 'Superman', 'good', 'almost', 'too', 'good', ""n't"", 'tempered', 'can', 'be', 'dry', 'dull', 'can', 'be', 'Sunday', 'sermon', 'overpowered', 'boy', 'scout', 'little', 'more', 'Perhaps', 'Nolan', 'should', 'have', 'watch', 'Captain', 'America', 'First', 'Avenger', 'get', 'ideas', 'how', 'give', 'spirited', 'treatment', 'slightly', 'hokey', 'ideal', 'Nolan', 'Gotham', 'was', 'more', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'less', 'oppressive', 'sister', 'city', 'sitting', 'joyless', 'retelling', 'firmly', 'believe', 'something', 'wrong', 'that.So', 'will', 'keep', 'waiting', 'Man', 'Steel', 'truly', 'take', 'flight', 'rise', 'again']",N/A

1561928,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B008JFUPFI,mirasreviews,"[1, 5]","&#8220;Man of Steel&#8221; is a reboot of the Superman franchise with a very different sensibility than the original film series that starred Christopher Reeve and the more recent semi-sequel &#8220;Superman Returns&#8221; (2006). This film is quite a bit darker in its imagery and general sense of doom, and it&#8217;s a science fiction film of the &#8220;alien invasion&#8221; variety. On the planet Krypton, whose core is about to collapse, scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) tries to convince its leaders to abandon the planet and find a different home and values, while General Zod (Michael Shannon) attempts a coup to impose his own solution. Caught between politics and explosions, Jor-El and his wife Lara (Alyelet Zurer) launch their infant son into space along with a codex containing the genetic future of their species. The boy lands on Earth, where he is raised on a farm in Kansas by human parents who name him Clark.I&#8217;m sure we all knew that much, but &#8220;Man of Steel&#8221; spends 20 minutes on Krypton&#8217;s destruction, so we get a lot more exposition than in previous films. I like Krypton&#8217;s art nouveau-inspired technology and architecture. I like that the film shows Clark&#8217;s struggles to get on with other children while concealing his abilities, as well as his struggle to adapt his otherworldly sensory perception to a world that overwhelms it. Superman is typically an optimistic individual, in contrast to many superheroes. He&#8217;s a Good Samaritan, not an angst-ridden vigilante. But &#8220;Man of Steel&#8221; shows his inevitable isolation and the hardship that it brings, in spite of the fact that Clark (Henry Cavill) is a gentle and moral person. Then one day General Zod, formerly of Krypton, parks his spacecraft in Earth&#8217;s orbit and demands that his kinsman living on Earth be surrendered to him&#8230;or else.This is a terrific cast. Russell Crowe and Alylet Zurer are Superman&#8217;s biological parents. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are his adoptive parents. Michael Shannon is the villain. Amy Adams is Lois Lane, the intrepid journalist heroine/damsel in distress. I especially liked Antje Traue as Faora, one of General Zod&#8217;s lieutenants. She is more compelling than the General. I would love to see her play a primary villain. I could do without the grey palette for the entire film, which makes it looks like the color was sucked out of Earth long before hostile aliens arrived. Some worthless scenes of the Daily Planet newspaper staff should have been cut. But most problematic are the fights between Superman and Zod, which simply aren&#8217;t interesting. The film lost my attention there. Otherwise, though it is not great or thought-provoking, &#8220;Man of Steel&#8221; was entertaining.",3,Sci-Fi Superman.,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,2773,"['8220', 'Man', 'Steel', '8221', 'reboot', 'Superman', 'franchise', 'very', 'different', 'sensibility', 'original', 'film', 'series', 'starred', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'more', 'recent', 'semi-sequel', '8220', 'Superman', 'Returns', '8221', '2006', 'film', 'quite', 'bit', 'darker', 'imagery', 'general', 'sense', 'doom', '8217', 's', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', '8220', 'invasion', '8221', 'variety', 'planet', 'Krypton', 'core', 'collapse', 'scientist', 'Jor-El', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'convince', 'leaders', 'abandon', 'planet', 'find', 'different', 'home', 'values', 'General', 'Zod', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'coup', 'impose', 'own', 'solution', 'Caught', 'politics', 'explosions', 'Jor-El', 'wife', 'Lara', 'Alyelet', 'Zurer', 'launch', 'infant', 'son', 'space', 'codex', 'containing', 'genetic', 'future', 'species', 'boy', 'lands', 'Earth', 'where', 'raised', 'farm', 'Kansas', 'human', 'parents', 'who', 'name', 'Clark.I', '8217', 'm', 'sure', 'knew', 'much', '8220', 'Man', 'Steel', '8221', '20', 'minutes', 'Krypton', '8217', 'destruction', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'exposition', 'previous', 'films', 'Krypton', '8217', 's', 'nouveau-inspired', 'technology', 'architecture', 'like', 'film', 'Clark', '8217', 's', 'struggles', 'get', 'other', 'children', 'concealing', 'abilities', 'as', 'well', 'struggle', 'adapt', 'otherworldly', 'sensory', 'perception', 'world', 'Superman', 'typically', 'optimistic', 'individual', 'contrast', 'many', 'superheroes', '8217', 's', 'Good', 'Samaritan', 'not', 'angst-ridden', 'vigilante', '8220', 'Man', 'Steel', '8221', 'inevitable', 'isolation', 'hardship', 'spite', 'fact', 'Clark', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'gentle', 'moral', 'person', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'General', 'Zod', 'formerly', 'Krypton', 'spacecraft', 'Earth', '8217', 'orbit', 'demands', 'kinsman', 'living', 'Earth', 'be', 'surrendered', '8230', 'else.This', 'terrific', 'cast', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Alylet', 'Zurer', 'are', 'Superman', '8217', 'biological', 'parents', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'are', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'villain', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'intrepid', 'journalist', 'heroine/damsel', 'distress', 'especially', 'liked', 'Antje', 'Traue', 'Faora', 'one', 'General', 'Zod', '8217', 's', 'lieutenants', 'more', 'compelling', 'General', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'play', 'primary', 'villain', 'could', 'do', 'grey', 'palette', 'entire', 'film', 'color', 'was', 'sucked', 'Earth', 'long', 'before', 'hostile', 'aliens', 'arrived', 'worthless', 'scenes', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'newspaper', 'staff', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'most', 'problematic', 'are', 'fights', 'Superman', 'Zod', 'simply', 'aren', '8217', 'interesting', 'film', 'lost', 'attention', 'there', 'Otherwise', 'not', 'great', 'thought-provoking', '8220', 'Man', 'Steel', '8221', 'was', 'entertaining']",N/A
1561929,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B008JFUPFI,mitchell5954,"[1, 3]","Man of Steel is, in my opinion, a great re-introduction of Superman to the big screen.  Zack Snyder did an awesome job at giving new life to a character that has been off the big screen for about eight years.  A great deal was riding on this film from the beginning.  Superman has not been in theaters for a long time and the three installments that came before it (Superman 3, Superman 4, and Returns) have ranged from subpar to just plain abysmal.  Snyder had to have been under a great deal of pressure to make this movie good and, in my opinion, he succeeded.  This is probably my favorite Superman movie to date.  I even enjoy this a little more than the first Superman movie.  In fact this is probably my second favorite incarnation of Superman (first being Superman TAS).  I like that Snyder made the film more realistic, as least as far as Superman goes.  He also made it darker, but not dark like the Nolan Batman films.  For all those people who are expecting to see a movie as dark as those film, then you will be disappointed.The cast is decent though I do have some issues.  Henry Cavill does an awesome job as Superman.  He is not as good as Christopher Reeve or Tim Daly, but he does do an adequate job at filling their shoes.  Superman in this film is made more human than in any of the other movies, even the first one.  Clark is a good person to look up to but not to the point where we cannot relate to him.  The moral dilemma he goes through in the beginning of the film makes him feel very real.Amy Adams is not bad as Lois Lane but I did not love her as the character.  She does not have a lot of the wit and spunk that Lois Lane is supposed to have.  To me Margot Kidder is still the best Lois Lane.  I, however, do like how Lois is given a bigger role in the plot instead of being Superman&#8217;s love interest and the damsel-in-distress.  She is given more to do here than in any of the other movies which I like.Russell Crowe does an amazing job playing Jor-El.  He is a great leader and a good father figure for Clark.  I also like how he helps Clark and Lois out in the movie.  I personally believe that Crowe&#8217;s performance in this film is on par with Marlon Brando&#8217;s.  Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Jonathan and Martha Kent do a decent job as well.  They also play the parental figures pretty well.It pains me to say it but I did not like the villain Zod here.  The character is right but the actor, Michael Shannon, did nothing for me.  He does not sell the character of Zod well at all.  Compared to Terrance Stamp and even the Zod in Smallville Shannon&#8217;s performance was lacking.Laurence Fishburne as Perry White does a good job also.  The fact that Perry is black instead of white in this film does not bother me as long as the actor can pull of the role, which he does.  He plays the character of Perry well, but he is not given much to do.The effects are easily the selling point of the film.  The effects in this movie are vastly superior to the effects in any of the previous installments.  This film looks even better than Superman Returns.  I did not see this in 3D so I cannot comment on how good the 3D is.The thing I liked most is how they portray Krypton.  In any other continuity, including the previous movies, Krypton is portrayed as an ice planet, and the Kryptonians&#8217; technology derived from crystals.  That is not the case here.  The Kryptonian technology is like something you see in Star Wars or the new Star Trek movies.  I also love how they go into the culture and history of Krypton and why Zod betrayed them.  I do not recall this being done to this extent in any of the other movies.  There are things that they added to the Kryptonian mythos that deviates from the source material but it works well.The fight scenes are phenomenal.  The action in this film trumps the action in the other movies by leaps and bounds.  I was waiting for the day I would finally see action of this caliber in a Superman movie.  The action scenes are fun, explosive, and intense, though several really drag on.  I especially love the fight between Superman and Zod, though it ends on a controversial note.  Many Superman fans will probably not like how the fight ends.  I also found it weird but it did not ruin anything for me.Overall this is a great re-introduction to Superman for both longtime fans and a new audience.  Any Superman fan should be excited.  I am very much looking forward to future installments.",4,The Best Superman Movie Since The Original!,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,4479,"['Man', 'Steel', 'opinion', 'great', 're-introduction', 'Superman', 'big', 'screen', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'did', 'awesome', 'job', 'giving', 'new', 'life', 'character', 'been', 'off', 'big', 'screen', 'eight', 'years', 'great', 'deal', 'was', 'riding', 'film', 'beginning', 'Superman', 'not', 'been', 'theaters', 'long', 'time', 'three', 'installments', 'came', 'Superman', '3', 'Superman', '4', 'Returns', 'have', 'ranged', 'subpar', 'just', 'plain', 'abysmal', 'Snyder', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'deal', 'pressure', 'make', 'movie', 'good', 'opinion', 'succeeded', 'probably', 'favorite', 'Superman', 'movie', 'date', 'even', 'enjoy', 'little', 'more', 'first', 'Superman', 'movie', 'fact', 'probably', 'second', 'favorite', 'incarnation', 'Superman', 'first', 'being', 'Superman', 'TAS', 'like', 'Snyder', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'realistic', 'as', 'least', 'far', 'Superman', 'also', 'made', 'darker', 'not', 'dark', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'films', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'see', 'movie', 'as', 'dark', 'film', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'cast', 'decent', 'do', 'have', 'issues', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'awesome', 'job', 'Superman', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'do', 'adequate', 'job', 'filling', 'shoes', 'Superman', 'film', 'made', 'more', 'human', 'other', 'movies', 'even', 'first', 'one', 'Clark', 'good', 'person', 'look', 'up', 'not', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'relate', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'beginning', 'film', 'feel', 'very', 'real.Amy', 'Adams', 'not', 'bad', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'did', 'not', 'love', 'character', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'wit', 'spunk', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'supposed', 'have', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'still', 'best', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'however', 'do', 'how', 'Lois', 'given', 'bigger', 'role', 'plot', 'instead', 'being', 'Superman', '8217', 'love', 'interest', 'damsel-in-distress', 'given', 'more', 'do', 'here', 'other', 'movies', 'like.Russell', 'Crowe', 'amazing', 'job', 'playing', 'Jor-El', 'great', 'leader', 'good', 'father', 'figure', 'Clark', 'also', 'how', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'out', 'movie', 'personally', 'believe', 'Crowe', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'film', 'par', 'Marlon', 'Brando', '8217', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Jonathan', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'play', 'parental', 'figures', 'pretty', 'well.It', 'pains', 'say', 'did', 'not', 'villain', 'Zod', 'here', 'character', 'right', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'did', 'nothing', 'not', 'sell', 'character', 'Zod', 'well', 'Compared', 'Terrance', 'Stamp', 'even', 'Zod', 'Smallville', 'Shannon', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'was', 'lacking.Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Perry', 'White', 'good', 'job', 'also', 'fact', 'Perry', 'black', 'instead', 'white', 'film', 'not', 'bother', 'as', 'long', 'actor', 'can', 'pull', 'role', 'character', 'Perry', 'well', 'not', 'given', 'much', 'do.The', 'effects', 'are', 'easily', 'selling', 'point', 'film', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'vastly', 'superior', 'effects', 'previous', 'installments', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'did', 'not', 'see', '3D', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'how', 'good', '3D', 'is.The', 'thing', 'liked', 'most', 'how', 'portray', 'Krypton', 'other', 'continuity', 'including', 'previous', 'movies', 'Krypton', 'portrayed', 'ice', 'planet', 'Kryptonians', '8217', 'technology', 'derived', 'crystals', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'Kryptonian', 'technology', 'something', 'see', 'Star', 'Wars', 'new', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movies', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'go', 'culture', 'history', 'Krypton', 'why', 'Zod', 'betrayed', 'do', 'not', 'recall', 'being', 'done', 'extent', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'things', 'added', 'Kryptonian', 'mythos', 'source', 'material', 'well.The', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'action', 'film', 'action', 'other', 'movies', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'was', 'waiting', 'day', 'would', 'finally', 'see', 'action', 'caliber', 'Superman', 'movie', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'explosive', 'intense', 'several', 'really', 'drag', 'especially', 'love', 'fight', 'Superman', 'Zod', 'controversial', 'note', 'Many', 'Superman', 'fans', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'how', 'fight', 'also', 'found', 'did', 'not', 'ruin', 'anything', 'me.Overall', 'great', 're-introduction', 'Superman', 'longtime', 'fans', 'new', 'audience', 'Superman', 'fan', 'should', 'be', 'excited', 'am', 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'future', 'installments']",N/A

The movie was fantastic maybe some of the fight scenes went a little to long but they were still very good. It keeps true to the superman orgins and gives it a little bit more darkness to the story. cavil plays a great superman(i'm still more into Reeves but cavil rocked too.) michael Shanon was a very good and very dark Zod and thought he played the role to a tee. I felt every one did a great job except maybe amy adams as lois. i have nothing agianst adams and most of the time enjoy her acting but she just didnt sell me on the lois lane role. but i'm sure others might disagree.Now about the 3D. I have written a lot of 3d reviews and i do love that style. man of steel however is what most would call a mixed bag. now to all those who saw man of steel in the theater like myself probably came out thinking this was a lackluster 3d movie and i 100% agree with them. However the 3d blu ray release has gone pardon the pun ""leaps and bounds"" better than the theater 3d experirence. It is still kind of lack luster comopared to how it could have been. The depth is way better on 3d blu ray and there are about 5-8 pop outs i can remeber and most happen pretty quickly. The only thing that makes me sad on the 3d area is that with the story,lay out and with all the cgi they used they could have made a big time 3d experince that would have made avatar look like amauter hour.But the kept the 3d in the reserve area. so in other words, did they use 3d in the movie and have it shown..Yes is it as good as it could have been...far from.The movie is a 4.5/5the audio is a 5/5the 3d is a 3.75/5 to a 4/5Overall a great movie. fans of the dark knight series/superman or comics in general will probably like the movie. I gave it 4 stars cause everything was there for me to like except i wish they would have pushed the 3d a bit more cuase they could have the 3d in this movie go from average to one of the best 3d experinces you could bring home. either way it is a great movie and i highly recommend it.",4,Superman the 3D review,1384214400,"11 12, 2013",2013,2070,"['start', 'off', 'i', 'grew', 'up', 'superman', 'loved', 'comics', 'even', 'more', 'movie', 'was', 'fantastic', 'maybe', 'fight', 'scenes', 'went', 'little', 'long', 'were', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'true', 'superman', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'darkness', 'story', 'cavil', 'great', 'superman', 'i', ""'m"", 'still', 'more', 'Reeves', 'cavil', 'rocked', 'too', 'michael', 'Shanon', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'dark', 'Zod', 'thought', 'played', 'role', 'tee', 'felt', 'one', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'maybe', 'amy', 'adams', 'lois', 'i', 'have', 'nothing', 'agianst', 'adams', 'most', 'time', 'enjoy', 'acting', 'just', 'didnt', 'sell', 'lois', 'lane', 'role', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'others', 'might', 'disagree.Now', '3D', 'have', 'written', 'lot', '3d', 'reviews', 'i', 'do', 'love', 'style', 'man', 'steel', 'however', 'what', 'most', 'would', 'call', 'mixed', 'bag', 'now', 'who', 'saw', 'man', 'steel', 'theater', 'probably', 'came', 'out', 'thinking', 'was', 'lackluster', '3d', 'movie', 'i', '100', '%', 'agree', 'However', '3d', 'blu', 'ray', 'release', 'gone', 'pardon', 'pun', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'better', 'theater', '3d', 'experirence', 'still', 'kind', 'lack', 'luster', 'comopared', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'depth', 'way', 'better', '3d', 'blu', 'ray', 'are', '5-8', 'pop', 'outs', 'i', 'can', 'remeber', 'most', 'happen', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'only', 'thing', 'sad', '3d', 'area', 'story', 'lay', 'out', 'cgi', 'used', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'big', 'time', '3d', 'experince', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'avatar', 'look', 'amauter', 'hour.But', 'kept', '3d', 'reserve', 'area', 'so', 'other', 'words', 'did', 'use', '3d', 'movie', 'have', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'from.The', 'movie', '4.5/5the', 'audio', '5/5the', '3d', '3.75/5', '4/5Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'fans', 'dark', 'knight', 'series/superman', 'comics', 'general', 'will', 'probably', 'movie', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'cause', 'everything', 'was', 'there', 'like', 'i', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'pushed', '3d', 'bit', 'more', 'cuase', 'could', 'have', '3d', 'movie', 'go', 'average', 'one', 'best', '3d', 'experinces', 'could', 'bring', 'home', 'way', 'great', 'movie', 'i', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

1561936,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B008JFUPFI,M. Oleson,"[3, 9]","This is a theatrical review of ""Man of Steel"" and may contain spoilers.Like Spider-Man and Batman, Superman gets a reboot as director Zack Snyder, with a big assist from producer Christopher Nolan, conjure a darker setting for the Krypton immigrant. The film opens on the doomed planet Krypton where Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) have borne a child, conceived the old fashion way which is illegal based on the government's genetically manipulative mandate. Consistent with Superman lore, the planet will soon self-destruct mostly due poor management by the government.In actuality both Jor-El and Gen. Zod (Michael Shannon) have beefs with the government, but Zod acts on his own authority which gets him sentenced to a lifetime of floating in space. Jor-El and Lara manage to send baby Kal-El into the void destined for Earth along with some magical codex which will allow Jor-El to materialize later and provide fatherly advice. I was quite impressed with this original act. The artwork is excellent and there is a nice mixture of advanced science mixed in with rides on flying dragon-like creatures.As the scene changes quickly to Clark Kent working on a fishing boat then a young Clark having to ""save"" a school bus that plunges into a lake, I'm wondering where all those earlier years went. We do get to fill in the gaps as the film occasionally goes into flashback. What makes this second act compelling is that we understand Clark/Kal-El's dilemma. His adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (nicely played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), believe Clark (a bulked up Henry Cavill) should keep his super powers a secret. They are rightly concerned that this ""difference"" will ultimately be detrimental to his growth. Mankind has a history of not always accepting others who may be different.Clark eventually leaves Kansas searching for the right answers. This leads him to the Arctic where he finds his biological father in the form of a codex hologram. Jor-El suggests that Clark was sent to Earth to improve human existence where they failed on Krypton. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) has entered the picture by now. She's a prize winning reporter who is searching for the mysterious man who has saved many lives.""Man of Steel"" does depart from familiar legend in several ways. First, Superman is only spoken once that I recall. The ""S"" on the eventual suit is a Krypton symbol, not an ""S."" While Superman can indeed be weakened, it isn't by some glowing green rock. Most interesting of all is that, there are few secrets between Clark and Lois. We don't have to ask ourselves why Lois doesn't recognize that ""Sup"" is Clark with horned-rimmed glasses.So where does this movie begin to falter. In the final act, as Superman must deal with Zod who was freed when Krypton exploded. Zod, and his hot lieutenant and man hater Faora-Ul (Antje Traue), want the illegally conceived Kal-El destroyed and wants to take over Earth for his own species. The movie goes into full out ""Transformer""-styled destructive mode. While some will feel this adrenaline rush is needed after the cerebral middle section, I found it tedious, loud and frankly, pretty boring. We've all seen it before in ""Thor,"" ""The Avengers"" and many other movies. It goes on forever. It's as if the producers said, ""Hey, we've still got some budget left, let's get the computerized wreckage in high gear."" Those looking for romance and humor will find little of it here. I suspect we may see more of that in the next episode. A final note. I saw this movie on a big screen (not IMAX) and in 3-D. I found the 3-D to be very good if conservative.

I noticed a lot of smaller details I missed in the theatre, especially in the Krypton scenes. The sound mix is good also. The score is really fantastic, all the other noises like spaceships and explosions don't drown out the dialogue. My gripe with this set is the special features. I thought there would be more. The big one is like a video commentary. I didn't care for it. It's sort of half way between a commentary and a documentary. I like how I can still sort of watch a film with the commentary going, you can't really do that here because the screen is some times split in two or three smaller screens with the film, documentary footage and interview all going at the same time...

In fact, after Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, I would rank Man of Steel as the second best of all the recent comic book turned movies. I knew going in that the critics were nearly 50/50 on the good and bad side of the fence, so my expectations might have been lowered enough to prepare for the worst and surprised when it didn't happen.The story begins with the same old origin of Superman, but there are enough little changes in the script and nice visual touches to make it seem fresh. As expected, the CGI FX and Hans Zimmer's score are stunning throughout.Henry Cavill makes for a good and believable Superman and Michael Shannon plays a memorable villain in General Zod. Russell Crowe really surprised me with a strong emotional turn as Jor-El. He is a good actor, but his work of late has been rather weak. I normally can't stand the character of Lois Lane, but I like her here, so that is saying something about Amy Adams.It's not perfect of course. The narrative did not always gel, jumping around too often, and it ran for maybe 15 minutes too long.I saw it in digital 2-D due to all the bad IMAX and 3-D reviews. It cut my ticket price in half and I didn't feel like I missed out. Also, my full theater clapped and cheered loudly when it was over.

Who will save us when we're at our worst?  HE will.  He is a symbol of hope, the one who is going to save us.  Many had complained over the years that he has become far too Boy Scout like, that he was too good and almost a goody two shoes of comic book heroes.  Here he used his super powers to do some bad as much as he did good with it, and people still complained about it.  Because Superman is such an old character, it's difficult to inflict changes upon him and have the general public just accept them as such.  Still, this movie had it's pitfalls as much as it had its good points.Like all reboots, we started at the beginning once again: Jor-El, a wise scientist from the planet Krypton, sent his infant son to Earth to save him from a dying world and who would become the Earth's greatest protector.  This was about seeing Henry Cavill's ripped and toned body to be sure (which was no small feat to achieve by any means), and the updated Superman costume.  Where this movie fails is that the story being told is choppy, jumps from place to place in terms of time and events, and there was a feeling like they were trying to squeeze too much into one movie.  They &#34;updated&#34; the relationship between Lois Lane and Superman / Clark Kent into an equal partnership and where she will know of his persona before he begins his job at the Daily Planet, which didn't seem like it had much of a difference whether or not she knows or doesn't know that they are the same person.  Superman fights General Zod and his minions, but it's more like he is preventing an alien invasion rather than the dilemmas faced in Superman 2 (which, like it or not, we measure this against).  The special effects were wonderful, but it wasn't enough to carry the movie unfortunately.  We got lost in a bunch of nonsense that didn't seem to make much sense once we got to the halfway point.Still, I have hopes for the franchise.  Henry Cavill is set to be in another movie (this time with Batman to pick it up more by adding the DC character who surpassed him in popularity about 30 years ago), and we'll see what we'll see.

Henry cavill was a good choice he definitely fills the roll.this was done in a whole new approach  I glad they did not do the kryptonite thing for it is getting oldthis movie does the same pace as batman begins you don't show the super hero yet you show the man from within who makes his own decisions based on what he was taught in the home. Diane lane and Kevin Costner were good as his parents.  the story is done very intelligently.Now for the action it is nothing but intense  as well as heart pumping  antje trave who plays faora ul zod's  female companion is awesome at total destruction .and the final battle with zod  leaves a destruction bigger than the avengers movie and keep in of this is only with 2 people fighting.The damage is done on such a larger scale one would find it kind of Michel bay ish  but you could not call it over the top for these are people from krypton and we all know when they come to our would and the fight each other  THINGS GET BROKEN  but the fights are done perfectly like cheering a rocky movie .Another interesting thing is in one scene when faora ul  fights superman in smallville she destroys a tanker truck belonging to LEXCORP  and in the final battle with zod a satellite  with the logo of WAYNETECH was totaled so we know what to expect for the next filmsThere maybe lots of people who are so over zealous of the movie but if the take the time and give this fantastic cast a chance I'm sure they would enjoy just the same .

1561945,A1Z1ZP2QPD9D3L,B008JFUPFI,Movie Gal With a Brain,"[13, 23]","MAN OF STEEL delivers one of the most visual and dramatically rich films of the year.  Brilliantly crafted and realized by director Zach Snyder, the film wastes not a moment in weaving a complex tapestry that redefines the greatest superhero in history on an unheard of epic scale.And make no mistake, this is the Superman of the 21st Century.  Director Zach Snyder and writer David S. Goyer have combined elements and touches of the most definitive Superman comics and graphic novels of the character's last 27 years to insure MAN OF STEEL is a faithful reboot, unlike Bryan Singer's failed ""Superman Returns.""  References and scenes abound from `Man of Steel,' `Earth One,' `Secret Origin,' `Battle of the Supermen,' `Birthright,' `Last Son of Krypton,' `Secret Identity,' and `New Krypton,' along with the New 52 re-launches of `Action Comics' and `Superman.'  Snyder and Goyer also courageously mix in new mythological elements that address our own world's controversial geo-political issues, all of which are grounded in the character's high morals and science-fiction mythos.Those with pacemakers, heart conditions or in walkers better get out of the way - this is also 21st Filmmaking at its best.  Snyder has become one of the leading stylists in a new breed of directors who mix film stocks, exposure speeds, camera movement styles, visual effects and processing textures for narrative purposes - and he's never been more in tune with his gifts than he is here.At times, the tone and drama of the dialogue and performances fly at you just as fast as his visuals, with each line and intonation as vital as his visual effects.  The extended opening on Krypton is layered with as much philosophy, religious contemplation, and environmental debates as it is with stunning renderings of technology and creatures.Yet, Snyder takes time to slow down when emotion, performances, earthbound reality, and narrative tone demand it.  Writer David S. Goyer has structured his screenplay in a fashion similar to ""Batman Begins,"" which he co-authored with MAN OF STEEL co-producer and co-story author Christopher Nolan.  While Nolan maintained a consistent pace and stylistic approach in ""Batman Begins,"" while cross-cutting `timelines' in that film, Snyder utilizes stylistic shifts to allow his visuals to become a visceral extension of Goyer's screenplay structure and dialogue.With regard to the film's performances, the casting could not be more perfect.  Henry Cavill embodies his triple roles as Kal-El, Clark Kent and Superman with levels of subtlety, regret, humanity, humor, compassion and - above all - humility.  He paces himself in each scene as `evolution' is the key demand of the role.  This is really a Clark Kent story, as film reveals to Clark just who he is and who he is destined to be.  In the first half, Cavill portrays a Clark Kent expressing loneliness, heroism, determination, and - yes - wit and humor as he wanders the country, struggling with a personal crisis - who am I, and what should I do?  Once he discovers his Kryptonian heritage, and identity as Kal-El, he `suits-up' as Superman.  Tragically, he must immediately face General Zod and his troops.  Cavill is a Superman who has yet to be anointed with that name by the people of earth.  Worse, he has yet to gain their trust.  For the balance of the film, we witness a Superman learning how to use his powers, protect the people of earth, and realizing you must have faith in people first before trust can be established.  It is a lesson he instills on the US military - those who most doubt his insistence he is a loyal American, through and through.  By the end of the film, Cavill delivers audiences' expectations of seeing the fully formed Superman and Clark Kent.Amy Adam's Lois Lane is the exact embodiment of what we'd expect from an aggressive, Pulitzer Prize winning reporter.  She expresses hard-edged yet beautiful humanity when she stumbles onto the story of the century, only to realize she can't run it as it means ruining a man's life.  Michael Shannon brings to Zod a level of depth beyond just rage and vengeance.  A key revelation in his character is a tragic one.  We learn that he faces fulfilling a destiny he did not choose for himself.  As Clark's mother, Diane Lane balances showing concern and fear for her son as his powers emerge and he begins questioning why God made him this way.  Lane treats her Kryptonian adopted son as she would any child, hiding her fear and learning how to help her son control his powers.  Her goal is that of all mothers - teaching her son that childhood is just a phase of life, not its end.In the Superman saga, the most important parental figures have always been the fathers - Jor-El and Jonathan Kent.  It's the casting of Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent that illustrate to audiences who Clark is when we meet him, and how he becomes Superman by the end of the film.  In Snyder's MAN OF STEEL, it is done better than in any previous cinematic version of the character.Costner's Jonathan Kent is a complex man.  Upon learning young Clark has saved a school bus full of his classmates from sinking into a river, Costner is angered.  Insisting Clark must keep his powers a secret, when young Clark asks him if he should have let them die, Costner honestly responds, ""Maybe.""  He is a father desperate to protect his son from a world he knows is not ready to accept him.  A world he fears will turn its mightiest weapons against his son to kill him.Yet, with each flashback featuring Costner's Jonathan Kent, the wisdom he departs deepens, as does the love he has for his son.  And Costner's Jonathan Kent imparts unto his son the ultimate example any father who truly believes in principles can - showing your son that you stand behind them at all cost. It's the film's most moving sequence.Russell Crowe's Jor-El is equally full of dimension.  His role in the film is not limited to his scenes on Krypton.  When Kal-El finally discovers a way to download his father's `consciousness,' Crowe plays the scenes with kindness, reason and - above all - a powerful conviction of faith in his son.  Crowe is able to balance acknowledging the burden his son will face as he reveals Kal-El's Kryptonian origins to him, and the awesome responsibility Jor-El as a father is asking of Kal-El as a son to use his powers in becoming an inspiration and symbol of hope for the human race.  Like Costner's Jonathan Kent, Crowe inspires confidence in his son by reinforcing principles.There is a sense of consistency in the values of Jonathan Kent and Jor-El as played by Costner and Crowe - a bridged gap that seems almost cosmic.  As if the two fathers are at once separate, yet part of a whole.This is not a Superman for those clinging to the Fleischer animated shorts, the Reeves TV series, or the Richard Donner film.  And it doesn't need to be.  For those longing for those depictions of Superman, they will always exist - wonderfully preserved on Blu-Ray and DVD.  MAN OF STEEL does not negate these past incarnations, and it shouldn't.  Audiences should always treasure these previous versions of Superman.Yet, the vitriol and anger expressed by critics and some Superman fans against MAN OF STEEL mystifies.  The accusation that the last hour of the film is just an over-the-top, empty, bombastic, visual effects laden disaster movie?  Not true.  There's as much drama, character development and emotion to be found in these scenes as there is in the rest of the film.  Furthermore, the film's climax is a `toned down' version of many modern Superman PG-13 animated films, graphic novels and comic book sagas, including the classic 1993 ""The Death of Superman"" story.In 2007, the DC Animated Universe division released a direct-to-video film of this story entitled ""Superman: Doomsday.""  Rated PG-13, it contained more killings, violence, brutal action sequences, destroyed cities and adult content than MAN OF STEEL - and its running time was only 75 minutes.  I can only imagine what critics and many Superman fans would be saying this weekend had Warner Bros. chosen to release that 5 year old animated film instead of MAN OF STEEL.",5,MAN OF STEEL - The

Certainly because of Christopher Nolan's influence this reboot had a more &#34;real&#34; component to the story, rather than the campy versions before, although I think the reboot with Brandon Routh was too harshly criticized.  My criticism of the movie is that I thought the early development of the character and his back story was disjointed and not fully explored or explained before the invasion by General Zod.  The truth is that I wish General Zod had come in the SECOND Superman movie, after a &#34;Superman Begins&#34; movie, just like there was a &#34;Batman Begins&#34; before there was The Joker.  I'm worried too now for the franchise because Superman 2 will not jump right to a Justice League movie with Batman and Wonder Woman.  There is so much more to explore with Superman before we jump into a team movie, but that doesn't seem as if it will happen.  So, the director and producers have their work cut out for them.

Eschewing the trappings of any of the previous films, this goes back to scratch, effectively a remake of Superman 1 and 2 rolled into one.  It follows the demise of Krypton, Russell Crowe as Supe's dad sending him towards earth, and then wraps into that the story of General Zod (the always good value Michael Shannon), as a nemesis for our man of steel.So what do we get - an origin story, which is quite well done, and a coming of age story for Superman as he grows up on earth.  This is all told in quite condensed and non-linear format, and I for one was left wanting to see a bit more of Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as the conscience of Superman, his adoptive parents.  It segues in to a final half which is a long, oh yes, really too long, series of action set pieces as Zod and Superman face off.  Frankly, it has a few endings too many, Snyder belying his love of action over substance, and the action becoming more and more devoid of thrills.  As a whole then, it's just impossible not to compare to the original, and it really does serve to remind you just how clever the structure of that first Superman movie was.  Cavill is a wonderfully brooding and intense Superman - but where is the vulnerability of Clark Kent?  There is just something missing in the beats of how Kal-El becomes Superman, the elements of him learning about what it is to be human.  The sci-fi elements might surprise you, and the colours are very muted in contrast to the primary coloured days of Christopher Reeve.  Hans Zimmer has delivered an effective score underlying the dark and serious tone - but as with the rest of the movie, it all lacks just a tad of humour which would have made it all easier to swallow.Ultimately a reasonably well put together movie with genuinely decent effects is let down by its lack of the one thing that Superman was really all about - humanity.  Instead of gaining an understanding of humanity by looking at it through an aliens eyes, the movie spends its time trying to understand the alien looking through humanities eyes.  Still, if action, sci-fi and set-piece after set-piece are your thing, then go ahead, you'll have a blast.  For the rest of us, we will mourn the passing of the Superman we once knew.(4/10)",3,Superman Reimagined,1395878400,"03 27, 2014",2014,2375,"['Henry', 'Cavill', 'Tudors', 'out', 'suit', 'Zack', 'Snyder', '300', 'directing', 'duties', 're-imagining', 'Superman', 'story', 'Eschewing', 'trappings', 'previous', 'films', 'back', 'scratch', 'effectively', 'remake', 'Superman', '1', '2', 'rolled', 'one', 'demise', 'Krypton', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Supe', 'dad', 'sending', 'towards', 'earth', 'then', 'wraps', 'story', 'General', 'Zod', 'always', 'good', 'value', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'nemesis', 'man', 'steel.So', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'origin', 'story', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'Superman', 'up', 'earth', 'told', 'quite', 'condensed', 'non-linear', 'format', 'one', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'see', 'bit', 'more', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'conscience', 'Superman', 'adoptive', 'parents', 'final', 'half', 'long', 'oh', 'yes', 'really', 'too', 'long', 'series', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'Zod', 'Superman', 'face', 'off', 'Frankly', 'few', 'endings', 'too', 'many', 'Snyder', 'belying', 'love', 'action', 'substance', 'action', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'devoid', 'thrills', 'whole', 'then', 'just', 'impossible', 'not', 'compare', 'original', 'really', 'serve', 'remind', 'just', 'how', 'clever', 'structure', 'first', 'Superman', 'movie', 'was', 'Cavill', 'wonderfully', 'brooding', 'intense', 'Superman', 'where', 'vulnerability', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'just', 'something', 'missing', 'beats', 'how', 'Kal-El', 'Superman', 'elements', 'learning', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'might', 'surprise', 'colours', 'are', 'very', 'muted', 'contrast', 'primary', 'coloured', 'days', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'delivered', 'effective', 'score', 'underlying', 'dark', 'serious', 'tone', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'tad', 'humour', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'easier', 'swallow.Ultimately', 'reasonably', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'decent', 'effects', 'let', 'down', 'lack', 'one', 'thing', 'Superman', 'was', 'really', 'humanity', 'Instead', 'gaining', 'understanding', 'humanity', 'looking', 'aliens', 'eyes', 'movie', 'time', 'trying', 'understand', 'alien', 'looking', 'humanities', 'eyes', 'Still', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'set-piece', 'set-piece', 'are', 'thing', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', ""'ll"", 'have', 'blast', 'rest', 'will', 'mourn', 'passing', 'Superman', 'once', 'knew', '4/10']",N/A

1561962,A3QQG36VOYQB5U,B008JFUPFI,MurphtheSurf,"[0, 2]","Just for fun.Man of Steel: Five stars right up to the last moments and then the flight falters&#8230;.a bit. I disagreed with the &#8220;thumbs down&#8221; reviewers in their assessment of most of the film, until the last few minutes and then I agreed with them: thus four stars out of five.The first two hours of the film was a surprise and generally a delight. But the last 10 minutes had the feel of a film where the script, the direction and the production did not know how to close the deal with the viewer effectively. Here is where they went wrong: An overly long fight scene between Kal-El and Zod, an inexplicable death dealing neck twist, and the emergence of a completely undisguised Clark at the Planet left me and those I was with a bit let down.The combat went on and on and on and on and was the same set of moves at different toppling skyscrapers. Lop five minutes off of it and it improves.Superman does not intentionally kill others- that&#8217;s one of his DC Canon hallmarks. Why couldn&#8217;t there have been a &#8220;Kansas Farm Boy&#8221; bit of wisdom?&#8230;..have Kal-El warn Zod that just as super-hearing can overwhelm so can the other powers and then have Zod burn himself out overusing his heat vision. Kansas wisdom: take it slow, moderation in all things, know your field before you plow it.And then Clark is &#8220;welcomed to the Planet&#8221; (a lame word play? in a city that is all but destroyed with a smoldering Smallville somewhere off in the distance) this whole things seemed surreal. How can EVERYONE NOT recognize him? His public presence during the face off with the Fascist Kryptonians certainly was filmed by someone in this day of ubiquitous camera phones. Why not dare to take the Martian Manhunter approach where his physical appearance as John Jones is completely different from J&#8217;onn J&#8217;onzz? What if Clark had altered features like Lemont Cranton, the Shadow, did? I suppose it is too much of a chance, too big of a gamble, too far a reach&#8230;but it would have gone a long way it making his so-called &#8220;secret identity&#8221; a bit more real.Still I loved the origin story with all its angst. We loved the two dads (and saw hints of the borderline personality in Jor-El that we got used to in Smallville). Their combined presence (in his Kryptonian genes and his Kansas jeans) are evident. We loved his &#8220;I can&#8217;t help myself&#8221; heroism.The Kryptonian science was interesting if not spectacular. Zod and gang were nasty enough. Lois was outstanding- a modern go-getter with as much drive as Kal-El but more certainty. She is Kal-El&#8217;s partner almost from the start. Indeed a common theme in the film, as in Smallville, is that despite all his power, Superman cannot do it without a little (and sometimes a lot) of help from his friends: Ma and Pa Kent, a clergyman, a general, a colonel, a scientist, and his &#8220;love at first sight&#8221; star crossed lover Lois.Will there be a sequel? I sincerely hope so.Afterthought- As I watched the film my mind wandered once or twice to a more serious interpretation of the films underlying themes. Jonathan Kent raises the issue of &#8220;being different&#8221; with Clark and worries that he will not be accepted, or worse, will be rejected and attacked, if his true nature becomes known. In our oh-so real world the question is not a new one. The danger posed by &#8220;aliens&#8221; who superficially look like us but unless they have been fully acculturated could bring us down and then replace us was played out. When key characters recognize that: &#8220;He is one of us.&#8221; It&#8217;s a turning point in the film. Could it be a turning point in our discussion of immigration, foreign policy, caring for the needy etc.  Hmmmm&#8230;.",4,Man of Steel Flies High....Mostly,1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,3780,"['Just', 'fun.Man', 'Steel', 'Five', 'stars', 'right', 'last', 'moments', 'then', 'flight', 'falters', '8230', '.a', 'bit', 'disagreed', '8220', '8221', 'reviewers', 'assessment', 'most', 'film', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'then', 'agreed', 'thus', 'four', 'stars', 'five.The', 'first', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'was', 'surprise', 'generally', 'delight', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'had', 'feel', 'film', 'where', 'script', 'direction', 'production', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'close', 'deal', 'viewer', 'effectively', 'Here', 'where', 'went', 'wrong', 'overly', 'long', 'fight', 'scene', 'Kal-El', 'Zod', 'inexplicable', 'death', 'dealing', 'neck', 'twist', 'emergence', 'completely', 'undisguised', 'Clark', 'Planet', 'left', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down.The', 'combat', 'went', 'was', 'same', 'set', 'moves', 'different', 'toppling', 'skyscrapers', 'Lop', 'five', 'minutes', 'improves.Superman', 'not', 'intentionally', 'kill', 'others-', '8217', 'one', 'DC', 'Canon', 'hallmarks', 'Why', 'couldn', '8217', 'have', 'been', '8220', 'Kansas', 'Farm', 'Boy', '8221', 'bit', 'wisdom', '8230', '..have', 'Kal-El', 'warn', 'Zod', 'just', 'super-hearing', 'can', 'overwhelm', 'so', 'can', 'other', 'powers', 'then', 'have', 'Zod', 'burn', 'out', 'overusing', 'heat', 'vision', 'Kansas', 'wisdom', 'take', 'slow', 'moderation', 'things', 'know', 'field', 'plow', 'it.And', 'then', 'Clark', '8220', 'welcomed', 'Planet', '8221', 'lame', 'word', 'play', 'city', 'destroyed', 'smoldering', 'Smallville', 'somewhere', 'off', 'distance', 'whole', 'things', 'seemed', 'surreal', 'How', 'can', 'EVERYONE', 'NOT', 'recognize', 'public', 'presence', 'face', 'Fascist', 'Kryptonians', 'certainly', 'was', 'filmed', 'someone', 'day', 'ubiquitous', 'camera', 'phones', 'Why', 'not', 'dare', 'take', 'Martian', 'Manhunter', 'approach', 'where', 'physical', 'appearance', 'John', 'Jones', 'completely', 'different', 'J', '8217', 'J', '8217', 'onzz', 'What', 'Clark', 'had', 'altered', 'features', 'Lemont', 'Cranton', 'Shadow', 'did', 'suppose', 'too', 'much', 'chance', 'too', 'big', 'gamble', 'too', 'far', 'reach', '8230', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'so-called', '8220', 'secret', 'identity', '8221', 'bit', 'more', 'real.Still', 'loved', 'origin', 'story', 'angst', 'loved', 'two', 'dads', 'saw', 'hints', 'borderline', 'personality', 'Jor-El', 'got', 'used', 'Smallville', 'combined', 'presence', 'Kryptonian', 'genes', 'Kansas', 'jeans', 'are', 'evident', 'loved', '8220', 'can', '8217', 'help', '8221', 'heroism.The', 'Kryptonian', 'science', 'was', 'interesting', 'not', 'spectacular', 'Zod', 'gang', 'were', 'nasty', 'enough', 'Lois', 'was', 'outstanding-', 'modern', 'go-getter', 'as', 'much', 'drive', 'Kal-El', 'more', 'certainty', 'Kal-El', '8217', 'partner', 'almost', 'start', 'Indeed', 'common', 'theme', 'film', 'Smallville', 'power', 'Superman', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'little', 'sometimes', 'lot', 'help', 'friends', 'Ma', 'Pa', 'Kent', 'clergyman', 'general', 'colonel', 'scientist', '8220', 'love', 'first', 'sight', '8221', 'star', 'crossed', 'lover', 'Lois.Will', 'be', 'sequel', 'sincerely', 'hope', 'so.Afterthought-', 'watched', 'film', 'mind', 'wandered', 'once', 'twice', 'more', 'serious', 'interpretation', 'films', 'underlying', 'themes', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'issue', '8220', 'being', 'different', '8221', 'Clark', 'worries', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'accepted', 'worse', 'will', 'be', 'rejected', 'attacked', 'true', 'nature', 'known', 'oh-so', 'real', 'world', 'question', 'not', 'new', 'one', 'danger', 'posed', '8220', '8221', 'who', 'superficially', 'look', 'have', 'been', 'fully', 'acculturated', 'could', 'bring', 'down', 'then', 'replace', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'When', 'key', 'characters', 'recognize', '8220', 'one', 'us.', '8221', '8217', 's', 'turning', 'point', 'film', 'Could', 'be', 'turning', 'point', 'discussion', 'immigration', 'foreign', 'policy', 'caring', 'needy', 'etc', 'Hmmmm', '8230']",N/A

The last fight (SM vs the bad guy) seemed to have no end. After 5 minutes of fighting with no end in sight I started checking my cellphones's messages to pass the time. I knew SM will win at the end so what was the use of watching punches and kicks for so long. The only interesting thing was that the bad guy was a better fighter than SM.

[SOME SPOILERS HERE]  THE GOOD: Superman fans have been crying for the perfect Superman Movie, the perfect actor, the perfect special effects, the perfect story set & plot. We got the right actor, Henry Cavill in my opinion, does a marvelous job portraying the man of steel. Let&#8217;s face it no one will truly replace Christopher Reeve, but I think Henry C makes his own mark. He has the look & the body. Spot on with that. Kevin Costner does very well as Johnathon Kent although his scenes were very brief.  Michael Shannon did very well on Zod. Special effects were good. The ground shaking blast off when he flies was enough for me to like that sort of buildup. The destruction of the city buildings & fights scenes were all done well. The atmosphere for the movie was definitely on the dramatic serious side, this is good and something I was hoping for. For atmosphere, special effects, actors the respect was there and done great. Now for the flip side, unfortunately the bad outweighs the good in my opinion.THE BAD: [SOME SPOILERS] Just to warn those who loved this movie, this will be a bit harsh.  As much as I want to really like & love this movie I just can&#8217;t. It feels as if no effort went into developing Clark Kent&#8217;s story. Although what I mentioned above are all good points, special effects and good actors don&#8217;t complete a movie. In this case the movie lacks character development & story development and as I said no respect to the original story line. Oh we all know they can&#8217;t recreate the comic book exactly, that&#8217;s been tried, they can&#8217;t just do a Christopher Reeve remake either, that would be boring. What we got was Clark Kent youth in a series of flashbacks mixed with choppy scene changes during the main story, it did not flow well. On a side note to that, they did not do a great job making 30 yr old Henry C look like he was 18-19 in these flashbacks.  The movie just jumps right in to his struggle to transform to the red cape from the start, giving us no chance what so ever to relate to his character in this way. The movie has a feel as if we missed the whole first half.LOIS LANE: [SPOILERS] This important detail of the Superman story has been totally bastardized in this movie. It seems they spent so much time on special effects they actually forgot to include any original retelling of Lois Lane & Clark Kent. Lois goes to the house where Superman grew up and meets his Mom??!! And he doesn&#8217;t even work at the Daily Planet yet??!! Also although I like Henry Cavil, he certainly didn&#8217;t convince anyone in the last 5 mins of the movie that he could be a bumbling boring UN-attractive reporter, anyway what would be the point at this stage Lois already knows all about him. & who he is.  As I said, way too much emphasis on ending fight scenes & special effects, little emphasis on character development and main story line.As others have already stated, this is an over the top action super hero movie with just a shell or the appearance of substance. Superman story deserves more than Zack Snyder & Christopher Nolan gave it. Although the Christopher Reeve movies are dated, and at times a bit cheesy to watch, I will continue to pull Superman 1 & 2 off the shelf every now and then to watch. This movie will likely collect plenty of dust, I doubt I will ever  watch it again.",2,"No Substance, No Respect to Original Story",1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,3447,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'super', 'heroes', 'movies', 'portraying', '[', 'SOME', 'SPOILERS', 'HERE', 'THE', 'GOOD', 'Superman', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'crying', 'perfect', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'perfect', 'actor', 'perfect', 'special', 'effects', 'perfect', 'story', 'set', 'plot', 'got', 'right', 'actor', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'opinion', 'marvelous', 'job', 'portraying', 'man', 'steel', 'Let', '8217', 'face', 'one', 'will', 'truly', 'replace', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'think', 'Henry', 'C', 'own', 'mark', 'look', 'body', 'Spot', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'very', 'well', 'Johnathon', 'Kent', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'brief', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'Zod', 'Special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'ground', 'shaking', 'blast', 'off', 'when', 'was', 'enough', 'like', 'sort', 'buildup', 'destruction', 'city', 'buildings', 'fights', 'scenes', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'dramatic', 'serious', 'side', 'good', 'something', 'was', 'hoping', 'atmosphere', 'special', 'effects', 'actors', 'respect', 'was', 'there', 'done', 'great', 'Now', 'flip', 'side', 'unfortunately', 'bad', 'good', 'opinion.THE', 'BAD', '[', 'SOME', 'SPOILERS', ']', 'Just', 'warn', 'who', 'loved', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'bit', 'harsh', 'As', 'much', 'want', 'really', 'like', 'love', 'movie', 'just', 'can', '8217', 't.', 'effort', 'went', 'developing', 'Clark', 'Kent', '8217', 's', 'story', 'what', 'mentioned', 'are', 'good', 'points', 'special', 'effects', 'good', 'actors', 'don', '8217', 'complete', 'movie', 'case', 'movie', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'development', 'said', 'respect', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'know', 'can', '8217', 'recreate', 'comic', 'book', 'exactly', '8217', 'been', 'tried', 'can', '8217', 't', 'just', 'do', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'remake', 'would', 'be', 'boring', 'What', 'got', 'was', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'youth', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'mixed', 'choppy', 'scene', 'changes', 'main', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'well', 'side', 'note', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'making', '30', 'yr', 'old', 'Henry', 'C', 'look', 'was', '18-19', 'flashbacks', 'movie', 'just', 'jumps', 'right', 'struggle', 'transform', 'red', 'cape', 'start', 'giving', 'chance', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'relate', 'character', 'way', 'movie', 'feel', 'missed', 'whole', 'first', 'half.LOIS', 'LANE', '[', 'SPOILERS', ']', 'important', 'detail', 'Superman', 'story', 'been', 'totally', 'bastardized', 'movie', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'special', 'effects', 'actually', 'forgot', 'include', 'original', 'retelling', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Lois', 'house', 'where', 'Superman', 'grew', 'up', 'Mom', '8217', 't', 'even', 'work', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'yet', 'Also', 'like', 'Henry', 'Cavil', 'certainly', '8217', 'convince', 'anyone', 'last', '5', 'mins', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'bumbling', 'boring', 'UN-attractive', 'reporter', 'anyway', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'point', 'stage', 'Lois', 'already', 'who', 'said', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'ending', 'fight', 'scenes', 'special', 'effects', 'little', 'emphasis', 'character', 'development', 'main', 'story', 'line.As', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'stated', 'top', 'action', 'super', 'hero', 'movie', 'just', 'shell', 'appearance', 'substance', 'Superman', 'story', 'more', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'gave', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'movies', 'are', 'dated', 'times', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'watch', 'will', 'continue', 'pull', 'Superman', '1', '2', 'shelf', 'now', 'then', 'watch', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'collect', 'plenty', 'dust', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

1561987,A1DJYI522AO1MN,B008JFUPFI,"Noah Arsenault ""Winter's Read""","[10, 18]","To start, watch out for the first period of the film, set on Krypton. It's full of sci-fi and comic eye-candy.It was great that Christopher Nolan chose a darker hero for his superhero debut. Given that he'd been directing such-themed movies (Memento, The Following, Inception), wouldn't it follow that the Man of Steel himself would take on a darker tone? While in a few ways it did, Zack Snyder's fantastic vision (as per usual) and Zimmer's cold, bright score helped breathe a different life into DC Comics' newest film feature.While I'm familiar with only some films (and none of the comics) with Superman, I will say I enjoyed this one most. It is a wonderful, emotionally-involved origin story that leads you through the development of this Man of Steel quite well. Henry Cavill plays an extraordinary man learning what it means to be a hero. I appreciated seeing his normal human attitude shine through. After all, he grew up knowing no other way to act.Amy Adams as Lois Lane didn't fit as I hoped, though she did fair. The Daily Planet group did well, but were slightly off-putting. I'm hoping they do more in future films, if they appear. Michael Shannon's was my favorite performance: a near-emotionless (yet obsessed) general with a greater good in mind, and nothing will stay in his way. The climax of the story was just as it should have been.Here are a few ways Nolan's darker presence have seeped in. Krypton is seen as a plague, destroying to survive, but I won't go further into that. The threats in Man of Steel are very real, and have dire effects. This isn't Avengers. People die, destruction reigns. That said, the violence isn't blatant, but does happen. On that note, there is some language and frightening/intense scenes, but nothing more to worry about. I highly appreciate the lack of inappropriate material in this film.In conclusion, Man of Steel has not let much in the past explicitly define it. A unique costume, altered chronology, real terror and threats, character accuracy and development, and more are all defined by this film more than the previous ones (or other superhero films). I recommend it to all fans and newcomers.",4,A unique treat!,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,2160,"['start', 'watch', 'out', 'first', 'period', 'film', 'set', 'Krypton', 'full', 'sci-fi', 'comic', 'eye-candy.It', 'was', 'great', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'chose', 'darker', 'hero', 'superhero', 'debut', 'Given', ""'d"", 'been', 'directing', 'such-themed', 'movies', 'Memento', 'Following', 'Inception', 'would', ""n't"", 'follow', 'Man', 'Steel', 'would', 'take', 'darker', 'tone', 'few', 'ways', 'did', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'fantastic', 'vision', 'usual', 'Zimmer', 'cold', 'bright', 'score', 'helped', 'breathe', 'different', 'life', 'DC', 'Comics', 'newest', 'film', 'feature.While', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'only', 'films', 'none', 'comics', 'Superman', 'will', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'most', 'wonderful', 'emotionally-involved', 'origin', 'story', 'development', 'Man', 'Steel', 'quite', 'well', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'extraordinary', 'man', 'learning', 'what', 'be', 'hero', 'appreciated', 'seeing', 'normal', 'human', 'attitude', 'shine', 'grew', 'up', 'knowing', 'other', 'way', 'act.Amy', 'Adams', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'hoped', 'did', 'fair', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'group', 'did', 'well', 'were', 'slightly', 'off-putting', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'do', 'more', 'future', 'films', 'appear', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'was', 'favorite', 'performance', 'near-emotionless', 'yet', 'obsessed', 'general', 'greater', 'good', 'mind', 'nothing', 'will', 'stay', 'way', 'climax', 'story', 'was', 'just', 'should', 'have', 'are', 'few', 'ways', 'Nolan', 'darker', 'presence', 'have', 'seeped', 'Krypton', 'seen', 'plague', 'destroying', 'survive', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', 'threats', 'Man', 'Steel', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'have', 'dire', 'effects', ""n't"", 'Avengers', 'People', 'die', 'destruction', 'reigns', 'said', 'violence', ""n't"", 'blatant', 'happen', 'note', 'language', 'frightening/intense', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'more', 'worry', 'highly', 'appreciate', 'lack', 'inappropriate', 'material', 'film.In', 'conclusion', 'Man', 'Steel', 'not', 'let', 'much', 'past', 'explicitly', 'define', 'unique', 'costume', 'altered', 'chronology', 'real', 'terror', 'threats', 'character', 'accuracy', 'development', 'more', 'are', 'defined', 'film', 'more', 'previous', 'ones', 'other', 'superhero', 'films', 'recommend', 'fans', 'newcomers']",N/A

Actually it'll give you a headache. There is at least 45 minutes or so of fighting that is incredibly destructive to the environment. Bursting through buildings, smashing stuff, and my favorite; Superman or Zod (or one of his henchmen/henchwomen) getting smacked on the puss and sliding 100 feet on their backsides while making a furrow in the tarmac. Repeat 25 + times or so, since they can't hurt each other.The characterizations are bland. Mike Shannon's Zod isn't scary, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) doesn't seem very excited considering his planet is blowing up. Amy Adams and Henry Cavill don't get anything much on. Diane Lane is a grandma. Kevin Costiner is a farmer that doesn't look or act like one, and doesn't seem to be farming much. The premise of the codex(I won't give any spoilers) isn't plausible, and actually confusing. The organically depicted Krypton ships and the El family dwelling have no furnishings which leaves you with a feeling of disquiet until you figure our what's missing.But the real problem is that the production company let the special effects team go nuts.

There's a profound canonical error in the film: young Clark learns a life lesson about the limits of his powers when Pa Kent dies of a heart attack that he cannot fix. In the film, Pa Kent gets caught up in a tornado that Young Clark could have easily and, likely, anonymously prevented. Major faux pas, Mr. Snyder. The rest of the film is...boring? Uninspired?

Like Thor, I think most audiences have a hard time with the superheroes in capes (except Batman).First, the star power in this show seemed like overkill.  Amy Adams, great beautiful actress, but woefully miscast for this role especially where it was underused and very little backstory. ""Fish""? Another great actor but didn't need Perry White in this movie. Kevin Costner? gives good farmer ruggedness appearance (along with the acting chops) but again, he seemed angry. Why? Diane Lane is just too hot to be believable as a widowed farmer's wife.  Russell Crowe, great actor, he is MAXIMUS! But is largely wasted here.Second, the storyline is massive!  Too many things going on. I mean I could have watched at least 45 minutes worth of life on Krypton.  That was great!  I've always wanted to see more of what Krypton was like (as opposed to looking like a crystalline world.)Kal-El's basket-in-Nile-River-ride to Earth was quick then BAM! he's an adult.  But I did like the flashbacks to his childhood.  Again, I could watch more of this especially where there were poignant moments.  But we still had to get to the destruction, so cut short this part of the film.The idea of an alien invasion was actually captivating but the movie didn't go too much more into this.  By show of hands, who thought this part of the movie was reminiscent of ""Signs""?Then, it turns into the destruction of our beloved IHOP (plus a few other skyscrapers) while Sears stood tall.  Oh the subtle advertisement.  Then all of a sudden, we're back in the middle of the streets of Metropolis at the Daily Planet (like the mass destruction never happened.)I know, I know. Sounds like I should be giving this movie a bad rating then.  Sure there are gaping plot holes and a lot going on.  But this is one of the better versions of the Man of Steel since Superman 2.  It's a reimagining.  It's not Smallville or the one with Richard Pryor in it (RIP) but MAYBE the start of it's own franchise.  Hence, the ""too much going on"" is probably warranted.  It's a rollercoaster of ride especially in terms of bang for your buck.  I think Henry Cavill is great (if not a little wooden) but the Man of Steel has to be stoic for truth justice and the American Way.  After all, he grew up in Kansas.Should you buy it?? Sure why not.

I had hoped that Avatar had put an end to the CGI-for-CGI's-Sake big budget film, but apparently Christopher Nolan, who produced Man of Steel, didn't get the memo.The director and producers of Man of Steel were more into a special effects extravaganza than into presenting a film with a dramatic core or characters to which the audience can relate. There's nothing wrong with the special effects except that there's far too much of them and everything else in the film plays second fiddle to one more explosion, crashing building, or fist fight.Batman benefited from the Christopher Nolan treatment.

Unfortunately the few moments that shined were overpowered by haphazard storytelling and a script with little joy. Henry C. was never given enough to really take charge of the movie and put his stamp on it. CG action seemed to be the main focus and a solid story that flowed took a backseat. I enjoyed most of the changes they made, that's not what bothered me, it was they way it was given to us. Any given scene with Clark/Lois/Perry etc. seemed to last about a minute maybe, very hard to get involved in the characters when scenes fly by like that. Again, I thought the movie was decent but they could've utilized these great actors so much more. It seemed they were a means to get to the Star Wars style effects/action scenes. And the movie was really void of any great Superman flying scenes that the 1978 Superman had. I know the creators wanted a fresh take on the genre, but it's Superman, show us a little bit of humanity with the character.

1562045,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B008JFUPFI,P. Hardy,"[6, 15]","At this point in its seventy five years of existence, ""Superman"" has really become more of a concept than a character. As one of the progenitors of the superhero comic book genre, and a automatic staple for religious allegory and minorities, the character known as Superman is a recipe for success when done right. It's just too bad that most really can't seem to perfect the ""done right"" part.I went into ""Man of Steel"" with no expectations outside of a good movie. At this point of my life, ""Superman"" as licensed product either delivers or he doesn't. The discussions you can have with diehard fans usually ends up being the most interesting part of ""Superman"" itself (sometimes). The worst I could say about Bryan Singer's ""Superman Returns(2006)"" is that it was as offensively boring as Tarsem Singh's ""Immortals(2011)"". Unlike the latter (which is as shallow as it gets), it was full of good intentions, but nothing remotely decent to support those intentions. (If you were fan of the Super-stalker and scorned women Lois, then ""Superman Returns"" was probably the movie for you.) Zack Snyder's biggest challenge was simply making an engaging film. Something he is not incapable of. However, his biggest Achilles heel in this regard was the same weakness that director's Stephen Norrington, Guillermo del Toro and Christopher Nolan had to deal with. David S. Goyer and his own affinity for visual, but not detail.THE SET UP:""Man of Steel"" aims to be what ""Smallville"" was in the bumpy span of ten years. The story of Clark ""Kal-El"" Kent; the son of two worlds, searching for purpose and stability in a world that he actively hides himself from because of his literal status as an [humanoid] alien from another planet. From his birth, through his adolescence to his adulthood, Clark Kent goes through the motions of heartache, wondering if he'll ever be accepted for what he is, should he decide to show him. If he'll ever know his parentage. That is, until a tip leads him to 20,000 year old ship that connects him to the world he never knew ...And leads a group of exiled Kryptonians to Earth. Their sole purpose is to recreate the planet they lost as a result of their species' hubris, even if that means it's at the expense of the present occupants of Earth.WHAT THEY GOT RIGHT:CONCEPT:Krypton has experienced as much iteration as the character of Superman himself has; but somewhere down the line, the affinity and mythos that Richard Donner injected into the license really brought iteration to a stagnate halt. Here, there was clearly an effort made to inject a different kind of culture and lifestyle into Krypton, even under the stipulation that it still had to be blown to smithereens. And it's not that the previous incarnations of ""Superman"" and Krypton never had a culture or a way of life, no. It's that the biggest thing about Krypton was how Superman left the planet to come to ours.Here, the film gives you a proactive glimpse into said culture, either through expository dialog, a billion things racing at the screen, or the implication that Krypton is so sterile and self-controlled that they breed children for a specific duty and that duty alone. Everything on the planet is coded, cataloged and processed, much like every industry that provides its services to the public here on Earth. Their clothing, however ""World of Warcraft"" and ""generic sci-fi concept art""-ish much of it comes off, intrigues you at the very least with the idea of how their lives operated on the dying planet. There is a concrete reason for the existence of the ""S"" and oddly shaped symbols on the shields on their chests. It's an extension of their language and the clique mentality of the planet itself.The concept of Clark Kent becoming some nomad because he either draws too much attention to himself or is proactively searching for whatever that makes him who he is, outside the influence of humankind, is also an interesting idea. I like the idea of Clark not immediately knowing what the heck to do with himself as an adult; either being too enamored in his quarter-life-crisis waywardness that any job is never too lowly for him take, or he's really scared of interacting with people in general. It also implies that the people he meets, all of them of varying walks of life and personalities, would at the very least inspire him to become a superhero, if that's his intention to begin with.Carrying over ""Smallville"" Lois Lane's ability to connect the dots herself between Clark Kent and whatever guise of heroism he happens to take the mantle of was also a great idea. I've heard it argued that Lois deducing his identity ruins the ""love triangle"" between herself, Superman and Clark (basically Clark) and diminishes their relationship, but I don't see it that way. I'd argue the mere suggestion of throwing them into a romantic relationship, without pretense of setting up a foundation of friendship it can grow from, is the bigger crime as far as their relationship goes. It like, Superman as a character, is integral to what makes the franchise what it is. To move directly into romance because it's expected of Lois/Clark, is not only insulting, but an affront to both characters and anyone who appreciates their rapport.Villains with marginally sympathetic motives that drive them is another concept I enjoyed. Zod, Jor-El, Faora and the Kryptonians whom survived the destruction of Krypton, all of them are motivated to restore the lives of their lost civilization and that is something anyone can sympathize or relate to --- even if that was never the intention of the writer or director. You connect with Zod's mission: A man who is bred for war decides to do something about the degenerating state of his society because of the complete apathy of his culture. You sympathize with what he wants to do, even if you disagree with his methods. It's just a shame he's made out to be a complete idiot because he's never aware of the planet's destruction. It's all in the name of painting him as the antagonist against Jor-El who's content with dying but wants to save what's caused the problem for his culture altogether.ACTION:Hands down, ""Man of Steel"" contains the best Superman fight scenes and choreography in a live action ""Superman"" adaptation, period. Outside of the composition for the score, this is where the movie both excels and stumbles. The sense of speed and strength that's translated to the screen through the actions of the Kryptonians speaks in volumes and is delivered to the viewing audience perfectly in the second half of the film (Smallville brawl). The first half's action is almost incomprehensible with how much camera blur is used. Elsewhere, the film at least steady enough to focus on a particular event. Faora's and her giant Non-type friend, Nam-Ek, fight scenes with Superman are arguably the best the film had to offer. Zod and Superman's battle near the end of the while, while great for merely showing off Zod's prowess in battle, really can't be appreciated because of the fatigue from almost endless battle sequences that run on for nearly the length of a ""Smallville"" episode.PERFORMANCE:Performances range from great to stilted. In the end, it really depends on the amount of time given to an actor and how they deal with the material in the given time. Laurence Fishburne's performance as Perry White is probably the only performance from the minor human characters I enjoyed outside of Christopher Meloni as Colonel Hardy. He was barely on the screen, but Fishburne never fails to deliver an otherwise great performance. He embodies the hardnosed Perry White without ever breaking a sweat, and Meloni? Dude continued to surprise me with the little things he did as the skeptic Hardy who finds antagonistic kinship with Faora.CHARACTER:Starting off with the best character: Faora is ultimately the brightest and strongest elements of ""Man of Steel"" by the virtue of her actress, Antje Traue (""Pandorum""). How she handles what little is given to her speaks to her talent. The mere fact that this character is allowed to be as vicious and as powerful as her commander, Zod, without the sexist stigmatization that follows her gender is amazing. Faora is defined by what she does in the name of her planet and the role she was given in that society. She lives for war, she is a warrior and the film never judges her for that. Instead they meet her head on with respect and as a result, you've got a standout character and a standout performance.Similarly, Michael Shannon's Zod is probably my favorite take on the character. For the all the Aryan nation and Eugenic driven ideals that this character is motivated by, for all the crap he ends up handicapped by as a result of shoddy storytelling, Shannon chews the scenery in a way that is both self-aware and dedicated to the essence of the character. Zod is literally driven mad and to the extremes because of what his society programmed him to do and to watch him attempt to justify his genocidal ideas under the helm of Shannon's performance is incredible.Henry Cavil, like Brandon Routh, is severely limited by what he is allowed to do with the character of Superman/Clark Kent. He has charisma, but he's never really allowed to use any of it. This is largely as a result of the screenwriter never having a firm concept of what he wanted Clark Kent or Superman to be. Cavil and Goyer get the little tidbits that make Superman/Clark who he is (the need to save people because he has that power, the need to know where he's from; his determination), but when it comes to a solid characterization, the most that ever merges from both parties is ""brooding"" and ""aimless"". Also, glasses do not work with his face. At least, not the ones they chose.Russell Crowe as Jor-El is another good performance in the movie, but it isn't until the character's dead that he appears to actually get a feel for Jor-El. This makes his death a pointless endeavor to begin with. This isn't to say he's bad in the first act, but he is by no means as entertaining as he was as a hologram designed solely for expository dialog about things you already know about. He has a particularly great chemistry with Michael Shannon. The two do more to sell that Zod and Jor-El are estranged friends than the dialog really does through their actions and that's pretty amazing, considering what they're given to work with.MUSIC:I'll be upfront, I think Zimmer's score is better than ""Man of Steel"" itself. It's certainly better than his ""Dark Knight Rises"" score (the only good thing about that was Catwoman's theme). Most the things that occurred in the film never felt like they earned the grandiose personality of the score, which felt out of place in a lot of scenes. Other times it didn't and that was usually in the action sequences that hinged on ""Zod's Theme"" (""Arcade"", ""You Die or I do"", ""Terraforming""). With the exception of ""What are you going to do when you're not saving the world?"" and ""Flight"" the score itself really doesn't work on its own until you're given some kind of context, which is a weakness for a lot of Zimmer's scores. That said, Zimmer created a solid theme for reboot Superman and its one I hope he's given the chance to expand upon.WHAT THEY DIDN'T GET RIGHT:PERFORMANCE:Jenny Olsen is a character I would've liked to have seen more of. She's a genderbent Jimmy Olsen and that's fantastic (it certainly upped the number of female characters present onscreen), but Rebecca Buller never gets to do anything to warrant the necessity of her character's existence. She walks about in the background, states the obvious and unfortunately becomes a damsel in distress (obviously because Lois isn't fulfilling that role). The only time she's allowed shine as an actress is that one single scene between herself Fishburne that sells a particular moment of peril, but it never really resonates completely because you know they're not allowed to die in the narrative anyway. It feels unnecessary to cut back to Buller and Fishburne outside of reminding us that they're still in the movie, a movie where they haven't done much of anything. Harry Lennix is particularly underwhelming as a gruff General Swanwick, whose sole purpose in the film appears to merely give reaction shots, state the obvious in tense situations (""whatever they want, it's not good"") and frown at insubordinate soldiers under his command. He is really not given anything to work with, even as a character minimally ingrained in the action of the film.I went into ""Man of Steel"" with no expectations for Lois Lane, but Amy Adams was pretty underwhelming to be honest: The most I could say is that she outdid Kate Bosworth, but that's not a difficult task at all. At the very least, the character was honored enough to be allowed to participate in the film's narrative itself (what little there was), but there's so much it does to put her into a position that never feels earned. Other than that, she was just ""there"". There were far too many instances in the movie where her presence never felt necessary but she ended up in key moments (via teleportation or some other contrivance) because she was Lois and this is a ""Superman"" movie. She didn't have much to contribute to plot beyond a brief exposition that would've had her running from buildings like Perry and Jenny. If they really wanted Lois to be in the middle of the action, Goyer should've fell back on her history as military brat/daughter with connections to the military via her father, General Sam Lane (which means they should've used him). At the very least that would've facilitated a plausible excuse for her being in places where civilians are actively excluded.More to the point, her chemistry with Cavil as Superman never quite took off. As associates or friends, this carnation of Superman and Lois works, because that's all there is between them. Friendship based on gratitude for keeping his secret, saving her life and, well, a shared goal (save Earth). And I was seriously digging this because I thought they were going to handle this like ""Smallville"" did. Friendship first, romance way, way later. But the moment they even tried to inject the romantic angle into their dynamic it was like watching Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth all over again. It was just awkward as heck and never earned by the film itself. You could really see it in the actor's faces when they had to execute the kissing scene (they were not into it). Superman and Lois in ""Man of Steel"" make great Bros, but love interests? That is a galactic ""How about No"".David Goyer --- as per his usual methods --- has no real conceptual or concrete understanding of the characters he's dealing with. Really, I don't think Synder's direction helped all that much either, but he does not have the same impact on the character of Lois like Goyer does. This guy is a poor screenwriter who happens to understand the basic idea of a great concept for a movie, but cannot for the life of him execute it. I mean, he is just mediocre and continues to produce mediocre screenplays. I'm sorry Adams had to work with what was a bland interpretation of an otherwise passionate character. I'd hope she'll end up with better material, but seeing as I doubt they'll be rid of Goyer, I expect nothing more except a blander Goyer Lane.Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are really miscast as Jonathan and Martha Kent. Disregarding the ten years Annette O'Toole and John Schneider had as Clark's adoptive parents in ""Smallville"", Lane and Costner were not only limited in what they could do with the characters, they never truly felt as though they embodied them either despite their efforts. Lane as Martha is pedestrian. There's nothing remarkable about her performance, the film treats her like Rosemary Harris in ""Spider-Man 3"". It ignores her contributions to the film outside of a few moments and continues to hold the father figure up as the crux of importance despite her survival over the latter. She's not horrible (heck she's got a nice chemistry with Cavil), but I don't think she was great either. Costner phones in a performance that is perhaps crippled by more ""trailer quotes"" than even Russell Crowe was as Jor-El. I understand the intention was to merely depict Jonathan as concerned for his son's safety in the face of mankind's xenophobia, but the manner in which this concern is delivered is awful. His dialog is full of mixed signals. He insulates that he wants Clark to wait until the right time to reveal himself (meaning waiting until CLARK feels the time is right), but is actively against any decisions Clark makes for himself in regards to his own fate and that is by no means an intentional result of the narrative. It comes off both confusing and overly paranoid as opposed to a protective father who wants the best for his son. And worse, in a desperate need to differentiate itself from other Supermen origin tales, Jonathan is killed off in a manner that harkens back to Snyder's directorial debut, ""Dawn of the Dead(2004)"".It's literally a ""Went to save my dog. If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, everyone drop everything and come save me*"" moment. Except no one goes save him because it's supposed to be a heartbreaking and dramatic moment. The entire scenario is a plot contrivance that you could literally counter with a thousand different scenarios and come out with a better result. The moment comes off like a scene from a parody and I had to stop myself from laughing at the scene in the theater because it was so earnest in its intentions. The setup and execution was atrocious. To say the least, nothing was lost when Costner was removed from the film and I'm beginning to think it would've been less flawed if he wasn't in it to begin with.EXECUTION: NARRATIVE and PACING:The pacing and editing in ""Man of Steel"" is truly awful. For all the ideas that ""Man of Steel"" has, where it fails is the execution of these ideas. ""Man of Steel"" wants to be a film about moral quandaries, xenophobia, and acceptance of the different alongside a coming of age story. Instead what we get is a near-three hour film that feels more like a coming attractions reel for a movie that never came to fruition. Most of the important things, like how mankind reacts to Clark during his outing and afterward (like when half the city is nuked on ""Dragon Ball Z"" and ""Gundam"" proportions that makes both look tame), are glossed over in a painful show of a lack of attention to the world around the characters.Despite strengths lie within the visual and not so much the technical, Zack Snyder has proven he can and is able to focus on the finer details of characters in a film, particularly when the film has not been written by him. ""Man of Steel"", however, is just another instance when his collaboration with weaker elements and too many hands in the pot. This has him falling back on his visual eye. The film focuses more on the visual instead of the technical (what is happening instead of how it its happening) and as a result none of the characters really feel all that important verses the environment that surrounds them.The biggest problem with ""Man of Steel"" is that it's a three part story squashed into a two hour and a half film. And this is where I think, as a franchise, ""Superman"" has always fared better as a written and televised format. Bruce Timm, progenitor of the DC Animated Universe, proved that a ""Superman"" origin story can be told and be told well with ""Superman: The Animated Series"". The problem is that it has to be treated as separate from Clark Kent's life, because the biggest part of Superman's origin has little to do with him. It's about his parents and what they do that allows him to become the protagonist of what is essentially his story. ""Smallville"" sacrificed showing Krypton altogether and instead peppered its series with bits of Krypton the older Clark got and it was usually how it related to Clark and not the other way around.""Superman: The Movie"" managed to allow its audience to get a feel for Krypton and how it related to Clark's story in probably less time than ""Man of Steel"". All three previous ""Superman""-related media got across the necessity of Krypton in a manner that worked for its format and Clark Kent. The problem with the opening for ""Man of Steel"" is that it's wants to be more than about getting Superman to earth and while that is not bad it muddles the point of the film. The difference in Jor-El and Zod is appreciated, but the film strays from its objective: Superman's origin story, which is less about Krypton and more about getting him off Krypton.Here, it's more about Krypton, and Jor-El's relationship with Zod, their differing opinions on the same thing (Krypton is doomed; Krypton needs better leadership and less of what they've built their society as). It's twenty minutes of far too many things going on at too quick a pace. You're introduced to several characters at once, a conflict that you really don't have a great grip on or allowed to understand and the end of the world all at once. Why are these people at war? What led Zod to think his leadership would be better than the present leadership (besides hubris)? Goyer and co. really wanted to make an epic film about Krypton and for all intents and purposes, maybe that's what they should've done.But if they were really adamant about getting this into a film about Clark Kent and not Jor-El and Zod, then the entire Krypton sequence should have been moved to the second act of the film where Clark discovers the ship. Start the movie either with Young Clark Kent or Clark Kent on the fisherman's boat for ""The Deadliest Catch"". Get into his turmoil first. That way, the holographic version of his father isn't telling US, the AUDIENCE, everything we already know about in a show of really poor screenplay structure through expository dialog. As interesting as the CONCEPTS of Krypton was, the entirety of the events themselves don't resonate with me, no matter how much is TOLD to me as opposed to SHOWN through the actions of the characters about to bite it. And this continues to happen over and over in the movie. We and the characters are told a lot of things, but we're never shown them. Clark even tells how Zod to use his powers on Earth (""Focus on one thing"") just to justify the ending.Clark's childhood and young adulthood is sacrificed in the name of choppy ""in medias res"" editing. I'm not against non-linear storytelling, but they don't do it well at all here. The editing is just really, really sloppy. Christopher Nolan managed to make it work in a film like ""Batman Begins"". He knows how to pace a film and show us what was necessary to Bruce Wayne's character arc after his parent's death. Snyder and Goyer? Everything that happens to Clark in his youth feels like ""A series of unfortunate events"" that are meant to tease something greater but never come to full fruition. These are the moments where we're supposed to be getting to know Clark Kent as a character, why he is the way he is. But on top of some poorly set up plot points that are meant to be stirring and dramatic (Jonathan's death and the Oil Rig sequence), everything that occurs before the third act has nothing to predicate them.The pilot for ""Smallville"" shows us why Lex Luthor crashed his car and ran Clark over (it even sets up a great relationship). ""Man of Steel"" is perfectly content with the bus' wheel exploding for no reason and the bus going over the edge with nothing to show us why. ""Smallville"" shows us why Clark's powers are manifesting and how he learns to control them. ""Man of Steel"" is content to show us one really great instance of the how, but never the why and never how he learns to adjust after the first try. And this really makes the flying sequence come off as incredibly flat and without the sense of awe it should've had. If he isn't used to flying, how does he even know he can do it well? I'm not asking for three hours of a young Clark Kent story, but I am asking for some kind of attention to detail, some sign they cared about young Clark Kent as something other than a plot device to get them to adult Clark Kent.There is very little care taken into Clark Kent as a character, almost none, because they're more interested in getting him into the suit than they are developing him as a character. Show us how he interacts with the people before he ends up saving them. Show us why'd he chose the jobs he did. Does he even want to become a ""superhero"", is that even his reasons for searching for his origins? Why he is totally okay with revealing his identity to almost everyone he meets (defeating the purpose of ""Glasses"") and why is Lois calling him ""Clark"" in front of everyone instead of ""Superman""? Basically, it's another case of the writer dismissing Clark Kent as a valid character in his own right over his ""alter ego"" Superman, instead of treating them like one and the same.The antagonism between Clark and Zod's men is poorly set up. The crux of the story lives and dies on Zod's need to recreate Krypton on Earth and the Codex thingy and without compromise. There's an opportunity wherein Clark and Zod could've had a dialog with each other, maybe not have Zod come off as completely hostile from the word go. Plant some doubt in Clark who has nothing but the word of a hologram to go off of. It's basically one of the most avoidable conflicts in the world, either by Jor-El never telling Zod where he sent his son or sending the Codex in something else besides his son's blood (which literally made me laugh when that was revealed). But because it's ""Earth"" and this is ""Superman"", the narrative has Zod attack the planet without thought or consideration of other or adjacent planets.There's not even a moment where Superman attempts to dissuade Zod from Earth to someplace else (like Mars), no real argument whatsoever. The moment he finds out this is what Zod wants to do (in a dream interrogation because reasons and skulls), he's full on antagonistic. I also don't know why a general, a guy who looks for the best possible solutions through tactics and or strength alone, is against the idea of taking over a planet where he is literally stronger than his worst enemies. The reasoning provided is flimsy and at best something a petty child could come up with and Zod is anything but. Worst of all, excluding Nam-Ek, Jax-Ur and Faora, most of Zod's men aren't even used. Here we have a literal army of Supermen and none of them are used to their fullest abilities in a manner that would've benefited the film. Instead they all hang out in their ship and don't do anything. Superman's basic compassion for mankind is rather null and void. For all ""Red Rookie""-isms in this film, the basic concept of leading your enemy away from populated areas is a given for anyone who's even privy to the definition of collateral damage or risk management.""Man of Steel"" instead leads the combat straight into the heart of Smallville and Metropolis without ever showing Clark considering that maybe he should move his rear end elsewhere, instead of telling the populace to run into buildings that are about to be demolished by his very being. The massive levels of destruction really fly into the face what Superman is actually fighting to accomplish (as little death as possible) and is, in the end, all for a large special effects extravaganza that will either excite or bore you to death. There are more dead people from the combined efforts of Zod and Superman than there are people saved. It's probably one of the things that make the ending so horrendously awkward because there should be attention to detail. Superman should be held accountable for everything that happened and there should've been some sign that the destruction would hold repercussions. Instead we get an ending like Superman ended a hostage situation, the city presumably back to normal again.The religious parallels that extend beyond positioning Henry Cavil before a painted glass window of Jesus praying to his father or flying backward out of a ship like he's been crucified for our sins, bother me more than anything. For all the ""goodness"" that supposedly exudes from Jor-El, he really comes off like a man with a bigger superiority complex than Zod. He assumes that mankind needs an Uberman like Clark Kent without ever assessing that the planet was probably better off without him (because, for all intents and purposes, he's reason they end up needing him anyway. Clark's a self-fulfilling prophecy).He assumes Earth needs a guardian and continues to boost his son up as one, even in death. There's never an instance where Clark rejects the idea of the ""Godhood"" Jor-El preaches about, he just accepts it. That's troubling because it suggests that Clark believes, on some level, he is God-like and not someone who just wants to help. Whether or not that was Goyer's intent becomes irrelevant as I doubt he could properly address the issue anyway.TO SUM IT ALL UP:The problem with ""Man of Steel"" is that, despite all its good intentions, its acute lack of attention to detail and poor execution cuts its legs out from under it. If could I say anything about the movie it's that everyone who wasn't Clark Kent/Superman, Martha, Jonathan and Lois Lane made this movie half as enjoyable as it was when things weren't exploding and fists weren't being exchanged. Michael Shannon and Antje Traue really made the villains of this film. Superman, when it comes down to it, feels like a character that reacted to a series of events but was never truly affected by them. And that's not to say Cavil was bad --- he, like every other Superman so far, works what he's given and makes the best of a limited situation. That's about it.Or maybe I just can't get over, how, for a movie that's almost three hours, they were in such a hurry to get Krypton, Clark's past and the reintroduction of his heritage out of the way so they could blow stuff up. And if I didn't know any better, they worked on the latter part of the film far more than they did the earliest parts of it. There were some great ideas in the movie and for what its worth, I really enjoyed it. But, its problems are just glaringly obvious and the ideas weren't executed well at all.

1562047,A3V61K0EF38GP4,B008JFUPFI,Philip Scholz,"[2, 5]","I wanted to absolutely love this film.  I wanted to give it five stars and hold it up to the same praise as superhero films like ""The Dark Knight"".  But I could not.I could not for a number of little things that just added up and cost this film here that fifth star.  And, with about two minutes of extra footage and maybe a dozen or so more lines, a number of these issues could have been eliminated.  My best example is the reason for why the Kryptonians brought Lois Lane onto their ship.  I'm fairly certain I know why they did this, but I won't spoil it.  Had the film added just a bit more footage and a line or two and I wouldn't even need to bring it up.  If you want to think about it and other similar issues long and hard, go ahead and watch the film as is.Second, too many characters were either too calm or too soft spoken most of the time.  The biggest offender for the latter was our new Cal El/Clark Kent/Superman, Henry Cavill, who almost always spoke quite softly.  Apart from that, he was beyond a fine successor to the likes of Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh.  As for everyone else, they all lost their calmness about halfway through the destruction of Metropolis...and I mean in the entire film, including the flashbacks.  Speaking of flashbacks, they were sometimes placed rather randomly, like during the rescue on that oil rig...kind of a bad time to be reflecting on your past, Mr. Kent.My final complaint is that Kevin Costner and Christopher Meloni didn't get enough screen time...goes back to that little extra footage thing I was talking about earlier.  Though I'm a fan of both men, I do have another reason for bringing this up.  Christopher Meloni wasn't really built up for the audience, so when he was in the battle and when he informed his fellow military men that Superman wasn't the enemy, it didn't leave as much of an impact as it could have.  I'm sure he had the rank and reputation for his fellow soldiers to take him seriously, but for the audience, it's just ""movie speak""...the general, played by Harry Lennix, was built up better and the line in question would have had a bigger impact on an audience because of this alone.  Kevin Costner was great as Jonathan Kent and I just didn't get enough of him...that's all there is to that, even though he too was a little too calm during that tornado.Without a doubt, my favorite in this film was Amy Adams as Lois Lane and she could never get enough screen time.  She's been wanting to play this role for years and, now that her chance has come, the wait was well worth it...it's a performance I won't soon forget.  As I mentioned earlier, I actually liked Henry Cavill as Superman, once he got loud every so often.  I'm glad to see the tradition of casting unknown actors in the role continues, because that definitely helps me absorb the character than someone's performance as that character.  I had no prior expectations of Mr. Cavill himself, but because the rest of the cast was filled with such heavy-hitters from Hollywood like Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, and Laurence Fishburne, the bar for whoever would play Superman was set pretty high.  Mr. Cavill met that bar and, for the most part, surpassed it.Apart from my previously discussed issues, the cast all did very well.  Laurence Fishburne was a tough boss as Daily Planet editor Perry White.  I normally have no opinion of Russell Crowe, but I really liked him as Jor El.  My favorite scene in the entire movie was the one he shared with Amy Adams on the Kryptonian ship.  Michael Shannon played a fine General Zod, even if his behavior wasn't always conducive to military conduct.  Of course, Zod pretty much lost his mind and was now writing his own rules as he went along, having not sat down and done so beforehand.  Overall, the cast all did fine.  By the way, Faora was the original comic book character in her position as second-in-command and Ursa was a newly-created homage for this character in Superman II.Overall, I still really liked this movie.  The story was good, giving us a new twist to a tale told about a thousand times before.  The new darker, edgy Superman wasn't something I spent my life waiting for, but now that it's here, I like it as much as the first two Christopher Reeve movies, which were campier.  Also, it's nice to see what will be the first in a superhero's movie series where the superhero's arch enemy wasn't in the first movie.  Despite all my complaints, I do appreciate the effort that went into making this film and I look forward to its sequel(s).

Watching MAN OF STEEL again, I understand this movie better than before.  I'm much more open to admitting that there isn't really a definitive Superman in movies, or on TV, or even (pardon my herecy) in comic books.  When I first watched this movie, I felt like they had missed the point of what Superman was all about.  I couldn't wrap my head around certain actions Superman performed in the ending of this movie (I don't want to spoil anything) Re-watching this changed everything.  I feel I can understand Jor-el and his actions now.  Jonathan and Martha make more sense to me.  I actually like this movie now.

While movie critics often rehash the same old cliches and viewpoints filtered through the pseudo-sophisticated lens of reminding everyone that this is a ""comic book movie"", user reviews can get deeper and more interested in the guts of these films and generally treat them with far greater reverence. Why the need to mention this? Simply, ""Man Of Steel"" has to be the most dissected film since ""Watchmen"" (interesting that both are Zack Snyder films). I cannot remember many other films that have such polarizing responses to them.When it comes to the comic book versions of Superman, I am still scratching the surface. When I visit either the comic shop or Barnes & Noble, it's generally Batman that dominates the shelves. Couple this with Superman being the type of character he has been over the years, the shade of each story arc can vary greatly. While something like ""Earth One"" gets to the true essence of the character, there also exists a version where Superman is wearing an apron and doing housework. Overall, the Superman that everyone knows and loves can be quite different.As for the film itself, this is handily my favorite of any live action version of Superman. To me, this is an adult take on the Man Of Steel while still being available for viewing to the kids who are now growing to admire Superman. This reboot is about a stranger in a strange land who is trying to understand how and why he has powers that his peers do not. The entre crux of the story felt like Clark Kent's journey inward to make sense of the person he is on the outside. And like any comic book film worth its weight, it has more than one iconic moment that, if you felt as I did, will leave you with chills.Much has been made of the spectacle that takes place in Act 3 and while I believe some of it to be valid and interesting in it's way, a good amount of it can be thought of us a reimagining of the downtown fight scene of Superman 2 fully realized. When you consider two men who can lift a car over their head with one hand, the idea of them crashing through a building makes more sense. For my money, it felt massive and enjoyable.I have been anxiously awaiting the chance to view ""Man Of Steel"" again.

With an hour left in the film it came to me how to watch this movie, and how to review and rate it.I watched and rated this not as a superhero movie, nor as a Superman movie.  I watched and rated it as a sci-fi alien-invasion-of-the-earth movie, like Independence Day, for example.  Based on that, I rated this with one star.  I'm not a fan of those kinds of films.  They usually have flimsy stories, rife with senseless symbolism, colossal explosions, epic-style special effects and lots of screaming, both in fear and rage/pain/angst.  This seemed no different.  And, in that light, How the story's hero defeats the villain is not surprising, or all that shocking, if one doesn't view this as a Superman story.  I found this relatively easy to do.  Then at the end, they decided to connect this alien-invasion story to a Superman character.I thought the writing to be shallow and obvious, the acting to be okay, the special effects highly proficient and boring, in the sense that they were really the story, with the actual plot and dialogue there to break the monotony.

Is this the Superman movie we wanted or needed?  I cannot say.  But, overall, it hangs together pretty well, and the serious stuff is not overloaded (as in the Nolan Batman flicks).  In my humble opinion, a superhero movie should first and foremost be fun to watch.  I cannot recommend this to very young kids because there is a considerable amount of violence.  If your kid can handle watching NY City basically leveled then go ahead.  Now, all we can do is cross our fingers that a Superman/Batman crossover (coming up next) won't be a gigantic bomb.",4,Considerably Better Than Expected,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",2013,1159,"['better-than-average', 'film', 'can', 'tell', 'fairly', 'easily', 'production', 'crew', 'was', 'trying', 'create', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'bit', 'original', 'displaying', 'state-of-the-art', 'craftsmanship', 'Not', 'everything', 'perfectly', 'are', 'holes', 'story', 'incongruities', 'one', 'tendency', 'let', 'pass', 'scenes', 'do', 'work', 'work', 'tremendously', 'well', 'was', 'VERY', 'skeptical', 'going', 'movie', 'having', 'learned', 'was', 'attempt', 'become', 'Nolan-like', 'serious', ""'ve"", 'never', 'considered', 'idea', 'creating', 'serious', 'Superman', 'movie', 'anything', 'instant', 'failure', 'Superman', 'movie', 'wanted', 'needed', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'overall', 'together', 'pretty', 'well', 'serious', 'stuff', 'not', 'overloaded', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'humble', 'opinion', 'superhero', 'movie', 'should', 'first', 'foremost', 'be', 'fun', 'watch', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'very', 'young', 'kids', 'considerable', 'amount', 'violence', 'kid', 'can', 'handle', 'watching', 'NY', 'City', 'basically', 'leveled', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'Now', 'can', 'do', 'cross', 'fingers', 'Superman/Batman', 'crossover', 'coming', 'up', 'next', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'gigantic', 'bomb']",N/A
1562068,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B008JFUPFI,Ranny Levy,"[6, 12]","""Man of Steel"" is a story about more than just good guys and bad guys, like most superhero films. In fact, it's very different from Superman stories of the past. Yes, Superman is still trying to save Earth, but ""Man of Steel"" also tells the story behind the hero. This addition of a more personal storyline adds a more human touch to the superhero we have come to know and love through the years. ""Man of Steel"" is rated PG-13 for intense and violent scenes.KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Gerry O., age 11, says, ""the events, the story line and amazing effects will blow your mind"" and Anthony A., 10-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic also likes the special effects saying that Superman, ""has cool powers such as superhuman strength, x-ray vision, ability to shoot lasers from his eyes and of course, he can fly!"" You won't want to miss this new film after reading and watching Gerry's review below.""If you have seen the Superman films and read the comics, you will hear about this film and think to yourself - another Superman movie?! My moms are big fans of Superman so I was positive I knew what to expect. Well, I was in for a huge surprise.This movie is not at all like other movies about famous superheroes. It starts by showing where Superman is born on another planet and what happens to his home. It touches your heart to see what sacrifice his real parents go through in order to save his life.The movie shows Superman's life from a little kid to a grown man; how he has to adjust to Earth's atmosphere and learn to control his powers. Other kids think he is weird and pick on him, but his earth parents teach him to be patient and not to attract too much attention so he can grow up and fulfill his destiny. You probably would like to know what his destiny is, but you have to watch the movie to find out. The events, the storyline and amazing effects will blow your mind, especially if you get chance to see it in 3D.I like this film for number of reasons. The graphics and storyline are very engaging. I also think they couldn't have done a better job with the cast. The funny and courageous reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams), proud warrior and real father of our famous superhero Jor-El (Russell Crowe), Clark's earth father (Kevin Costner) and a new face on the Hollywood horizon, Henry Cavill, who plays Superman.My favorite scene is when Clark surrenders to FBI so he can save the Earth and while he is there, FBI agents observe him through a one-way mirror window. Superman has super powers so he can see through the glass. He starts making funny comments and shocks the FBI agents with his skills. But best of all is the reaction of the agents on the other side of the glass. You can see that they struggle to believe that this is real and they are also amazed and fascinated by Superman.I recommend this great movie to ages 10 and up. It has elements of violence and a bit of harsh language. The graphic depiction may be too intense for a younger audience. I love the film and would definitely enjoy watching it again, though it does get a little predictable in the last 15-20 minutes.""Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Gerry O.

And yes, I grew up in the Christopher Reeves era. I still enjoy Superman 2(the first was always just ok to me). But never has Superman reached his potential on film. Not like other superheroes have. Until now. There's no comparison. I don't feed on nostalgia. I still love my old classics but some newer interpretations are simply better. This had a good story and nicely paced origin retelling, great comicbook style action(about time) and I love the smart way of how Clark Kent can maintain his secret identity. They did it also in Smallville. Makes more sense. For the critics and few other naysayers, I don't think they are or ever will be ready for a true Superman movie like we just got.

With that said let me say that i am very pleased with this movie in this movie you could really tell that zack snyder and the rest of the crew really tried to do justice to the superman mythos and cared how things were done. While this is a good attempt and a very well done movie it is no avengers and it is not a great movie.First off what i likethe story is well done, all the characters from Johnathan, to martha, to clark, and lois are done and the modern spin on the daily planet is a good shot in the arm the series needed after the fall of superman returns.the effects are great they really tried to give you the feel of superman flying fighting and all the super heroics he does.general zod is a truly evil villain, from the beginning to the end he is single minded in his belief of what he does and his army follows blindly behind him.for dc fans there are a couple of easter eggs you will notice if you look like certain names and what not but beyond that nothing for the dc fans out there.The special features are good the examination of krypton is really good as well as the other features and the 75th anniversary short is also very welcome for the fans.they also made him more relate able in the movie which is a major plusNow for what i did not likefirst off zack could have done more to connect this to the larger dc universe now i dont know if this was a decision he made or one made for him but i believe it was a mistake.if there ever was a movie that deserved a post credits scene it was superman, this i believe was a major mistake, they could have linked it to the Dark knight saga or they could have set the ground for the now announced superman batman movie they did neither and i think this was an opportunity wasted.Marvel movies are known for the little shout outs to the larger marvel universe, little names, events or even characters not known to the non comic fans but little things that are known to the fans this could have been done so many times and while there is one or two there could have been more.the movie takes a little bit to get started, and while i believe there was no way around this many movies have this problem they still make the first part enjoyable, in this case it is good but the back half of the movie is so much better.some of the changes that have been made to the character many true fans may not like.This is a good movie and i truly believe that zack snyder and his crew were and did do justice to the character there was so much more that could have been done, this is a good movie with lots of missed opportunities that could have been

The actions scenes are compelling and the torn natures of the &#34;bad&#34; guys are also engaging and make for a great story.  The great flaw here is that the special effects are so over blown and at times ridiculous that they detract from the over all story.  The destruction of Metropolis and its miraculous rebirth only a short time later is just so silly.  In fact the bloodless nature of it is distributing and detracts from the story as a whole.

(I pre-ordered it the minute I could, which was about 4 months ago - shame on you Amazon for doing that! That is too long!!)  Anyway, I got my popcorn and soda ready, turned the phone off, and was ready to enjoy what I had heard was finally a great Superman movie.  REALLY??!!  Did I just get the special effects version that totally sucked?  Maybe it was just me that got the version that had absolutely no plot, no story line and just lots of a beautiful man in a tight uniform fly around and let towns and cities be destroyed.  Lois Lane met him for about 3 minutes before she became ""the one"".The actors did a great job, the CGI was good but became too much after a while.  When Zod was somehow (story line lacked and I got bored - forgive me) still on Earth after Superman had ""won"" the battle, I just turned it off.  I was ready to watch water boil at that point and had no interest in spending another minute watching this major FAIL of a movie.DC is getting their butts kicked by their rival studio because they don't seem to realize that the public wants more than just CGI.  You need a good script too.  What I don't understand is that if you watch the animated DC movies, they are usually excellent!  Why not adapt one of those?Overall, I am sincerely disappointed in the movie and can't believe I couldn't even finish it.

Poor New York gets it again, with buildings collapsing, exploding, imploding, shattering, falling, etc. The scene where Superman discovers flying was really well done. Henry Cavill looks ah-ma-zing in that suit, let me tell you, mmm-mmm. Now for the bad. This is a very serious Superman. It lacked the charm and humor of the Christopher Reeves Superman, and that's okay, I guess, but it got to be kind of boring after a while. Poor little Clark, picked on by bullies and his ever-so-serious dad being ever so serious about the whole thing. I thought the external plot was good - I liked that Gen. Zod was motivated to save his entire race -- too bad he wasn't so temperamental and looked to another habitable planet - surely there was another one nearby (Mars?). Seemed like they could have worked something out... Anyhow, the thing that bugged me the most, beyond the boring bits and the weird sepia cast to most of the movie, was the religious, Jesus-y overtones. Oh, Clark is 33! What a co-inky-dink! He leaves the ship and assumes the crucifix position. Not too subtle there. And he keeps getting lectured on how he's going to save everyone, and we're reminded that &#34;he saved us all!&#34; Good grief... I really wondered if they'd allow Sup to kiss Lois at the end or if they were going to maintain his priestly purity.

1562087,A39W3263A9HCMN,B008JFUPFI,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[12, 47]","Please bear in mind that I am a fan of both Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan. I'll spend pretty much every day until my terminal breath defending Sucker Punch and Snyder's Watchmen adaptation. Nolan's work with the Batman movies is nothing short of absolutely amazing and he has one eye for a tragic superhero story. He turned the story of Bruce Wayne into a beautiful tragic story of a man who must choose heroism or sanity. Watchmen is the story of former superheroes who realize that even though they're retired, they have a lot of saving to do- themselves for a starting point. And so when you take Superman and give it a dark spin, it's bound to succeed, right?Absolutely wrong.Alright, so maybe the movie isn't bad. If you're a pedestrian viewer wanting an explosion filled action movie, then you'll get that here. But for us Superman fans, it's a disgrace. I don't know who these &#34;fans&#34; are telling us that this is close to the graphic novels, in fact the way they adapted the comics is among some of the most appalling adapting work I've ever seen. There are problems right off the bat when Jor-El is stabbed to death by General Zod. REALLY? If anyone has even read the comic books, you'd realize that Jor-El is much stronger and more defensive than that. But it doesn't stop thereTo begin with, the Superman is greatly raped with a stove pipe and executed Tarantino- style throughout. He spends the whole movie angsting and whining. It's as annoying as The Tenth Doctor's final episode of Doctor Who. Alright, that's a little dramatic, sure. But half the exchanges between Clark Kent and people around him consist of:PERSON X: Clark, can we talk? CLARK: I don't want to. PERSON X: Look Clark, nothing is wrong with you. CLARK: I know. PERSON X: so why don't you send your powers to the world? CLARK: No, you don't understand. People CAN'T know who I am. They'll reject me.Every time one of these rubbish soap opera dialogues rung out over the cinema speakers, I groaned. To be fair, it is SLIGHTLY true to the comics, but they take it up to 11 here and it's unnecessary. The cutting of the film is really off here too. One minute, Superman is being interrogated, the next he's in the desert. It comes off as if Snyder dropped the script on the ground one day thus messing up the pages, then decided, &#34;ah, never mind, let's just shoot it like this&#34;. Your head will explode trying to make sense of this thing, man.And then there's the second half, filled with nothing but action, explosions, Superman pushing General Zod through several buildings (I laughed several times). The action itself is bloated, boring and incomprehensible too. Shaky camera and quick cutting combined with 3D, when I wasn't falling asleep, I was wondering what in the hot frak was going on. And then the climax, or lack of was just laughable.So, are there any positives? Well, the cast do a good job. I did like Henry Cavill a lot and I think given the terrible script that he had to work with, he did a decent job. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are also great, but the highlight of the film is easily Michael Shannon as General Zod. He really knows how to make a bad guy scary- watch the film &#34;Bug&#34; for proof. But he shines here and he plays the villain in such a way that you both feel bad for him and hate him at the same time, which is proof of a well executed villain.Otherwise, stay away from this turkey at all costs. Don't believe the positive reviews, the critics are right for once. I figured it was just the unhealthy and unfair hate-on they have for Snyder, but nope. They're right. I'm guessing WB hired plants to write reviews, because a lot of the reviews do seem very much vague.

Kevin Costner and Diane Lane were wonderful as Clark Kent's Earthly parents (see ""the bad"" point #1).2. Clark before embracing his Superman side and out on his soul-searching journey was interesting and fun to watch (see ""the bad"" point #2).3. The evolution of the battle on Krypton and it's demise was interesting (see ""the bad"" point #3).4. The kid who was mean but grew up to become the manager of IHOP was amusing, what little there was of him.5. Lois Lane investigating Superman to figure out who he was.Now, the bad:1. The method of Dad's death was ridiculous. There was no reason for that to have played out the way it did; it came across as contrived and forced.2. Once Clark became Superman and allowed himself to fully embrace that role he became even more sullen and rather lackluster.3. The battle on Krypton, like all the battles in the movie, went on too long.4. No matter what they did to each other, no one from Krypton was able to injure each other in any fight until the last battle and the manner of death was nothing that we haven't seen humans do in war movies.5. Thousands, possibly millions, dead and Superman only reacted to save a human when he saw that it was Lois.6. Having never been a fan of Superman but willing to give him a try since he was no longer wearing his red underwear on the outside (much like the Batman revamp), I went into this movie hoping to like it but found little redeeming in the plot or Superman himself.7.

1562095,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B008JFUPFI,Richard Masloski,"[35, 100]","What a strange time for Hollywood of late, wherein history is turned into comic book and comic book is turned into history: thus we have Lincoln as a vampire hunter and the new Superman as leaden and lugubrious as so much history is made out to be.  Superman was born, not on Krypton, but in the pages of a comic book - yet this new take has naught of comic book charm, color, character or charisma.  One four minute Fleischer cartoon from the forties has more excitement and enchantment than this entire two and a half hour cinematic computer game.  Any one of those seventeen animated masterpieces is more artistic, better scripted, better scored, better acted and better directed than the whole of this CGI dominated disaster.This movie is like a baked potato overloaded with cheese, bacon bits, chives, more cheese, onions, some more bacon bits, loads of sour cream, a bit more bacon bits, another glob of sour cream....so overloaded in fact that the taste of the baked potato is completely lost!  All that is left of the meal is...overload! Which is to say that special effects submerge whatever story there is herein.  And that is a pity, because Henry Cavill is a super-looking Superman.  But he says next to nothing.  His dialogue could fit on one page.  General Zod and Jor-El seem to never zip it.  Yet the Man of Steel, well, I guess he is the literal strong and silent type.  But...it is a silence that squanders. And so much is squandered here and totally enslaved by...special effects.  How many explosions can one watch?  How many toppling buildings must one endure?  How many totally unbelievable alien landscapes must one navigate?  How many Superhero fisticuffs that seem more like WrestleManias on super-steroids can one watch?  How many cars and buses and planes spinning out of control and crashing all over Creation must there be?  When does the audience ever say 'Enough'?  When will the film-makers ever use some directorial discretion and say 'Cut'?  When will stories matter more again than special effects???But this is no longer a matter of taste.  Not really.  It is a matter of unasked for addiction.  A twig grows the way it is bent.  Recent generations have known little else.  For one, speed is essential in this technologically dominated time leading to rapidity of movement and thought and deed. No seeming time to smell the roses anymore. And it seems the daily diet of our days anymore is...disaster. All disasters, man-made and acts of God, are in our backyards anymore thanks to our technological tools. Last but nowhere near least are the unimaginable horrors of the forever caught-on-film, cinematic-seeming exploding, collapsing Twin Towers and the nightmares of future ones that have impacted EVERYTHING: mind, mortality, morality...and movies.  Our movies, our entertainments are now packed with even worse visions of total immolation seemingly to subconsciously prepare our precarious world for tomorrow's cataclysms - and also to act as a catharsis to what has already been lived and witnessed and forever seared into our collective conscious, the sub as well.  In the movies, no matter how many skyscrapers collapse and bombs go off, there will be the hero to set things right.  ""It was like a movie"" say so many when interviewed after whatever disaster has been witnessed.  So it would seem then that many (if not most) movies are not simply about entertainment any longer - but moreso on an unspecified, unstated mission to inoculate us all against the coming Armageddon, the next Holocaust.  Yet movies of the sort I am speaking of do not simply assist viewers in dealing with the chaos and calamity of Life.  Addiction leads, alas, too often to actualization. 3-D is an attempt to actualize - but it falls short.  Almost being able to reach out and touch the 3-D CGI bomb is close...but no cigar.  And that is but one of the dangers inherent in a majority of the action-addictive movies of today.We are all addictive personalities in a world that passes away faster and faster, that is much more disposable anymore than enduring. Perhaps the only way to end an addiction is to introduce a new one. Our humanity is truly being lost to the technologic. So a movie such as MAN OF STEEL could and should have used much more story, more character development, more humanity, more humor, more fun, more delight, more awe and, yes, more love - and way less CGI action by far!  Alas, as it is, it merely feeds the addiction for mind-numbing, sense-deadening, emotionless, brainless action.  Action at all costs. ALL costs. So despite its having ten minutes of value, this is not a movie.  It is madness.",1,"IT'S A BIRD...IT'S A PLANE...NO, IT'S...CGI!!!",1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,4646,"['What', 'strange', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'late', 'wherein', 'history', 'turned', 'comic', 'book', 'comic', 'book', 'turned', 'history', 'thus', 'have', 'Lincoln', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'new', 'Superman', 'leaden', 'lugubrious', 'so', 'much', 'history', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'Superman', 'was', 'born', 'not', 'Krypton', 'pages', 'comic', 'book', 'yet', 'new', 'take', 'naught', 'comic', 'book', 'charm', 'color', 'character', 'charisma', 'One', 'four', 'minute', 'Fleischer', 'cartoon', 'forties', 'more', 'excitement', 'enchantment', 'entire', 'two', 'half', 'hour', 'cinematic', 'computer', 'game', 'one', 'seventeen', 'animated', 'masterpieces', 'more', 'artistic', 'better', 'scripted', 'better', 'scored', 'better', 'acted', 'better', 'directed', 'whole', 'CGI', 'dominated', 'disaster.This', 'movie', 'baked', 'potato', 'overloaded', 'cheese', 'bacon', 'bits', 'chives', 'more', 'cheese', 'onions', 'more', 'bacon', 'bits', 'loads', 'sour', 'cream', 'bit', 'more', 'bacon', 'bits', 'glob', 'sour', 'cream', '.so', 'overloaded', 'fact', 'taste', 'baked', 'potato', 'completely', 'lost', 'left', 'meal', 'overload', 'say', 'special', 'effects', 'submerge', 'story', 'herein', 'pity', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'super-looking', 'Superman', 'next', 'nothing', 'dialogue', 'could', 'fit', 'one', 'page', 'General', 'Zod', 'Jor-El', 'seem', 'never', 'zip', 'Man', 'Steel', 'well', 'guess', 'literal', 'strong', 'silent', 'type', 'silence', 'squanders', 'so', 'much', 'squandered', 'here', 'totally', 'enslaved', 'special', 'effects', 'How', 'many', 'explosions', 'can', 'one', 'watch', 'How', 'many', 'toppling', 'buildings', 'must', 'one', 'endure', 'How', 'many', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'alien', 'landscapes', 'must', 'one', 'navigate', 'How', 'many', 'Superhero', 'fisticuffs', 'seem', 'more', 'like', 'WrestleManias', 'super-steroids', 'can', 'one', 'watch', 'How', 'many', 'cars', 'buses', 'planes', 'spinning', 'control', 'crashing', 'Creation', 'must', 'there', 'be', 'When', 'audience', 'ever', 'say', 'When', 'will', 'film-makers', 'ever', 'use', 'directorial', 'discretion', 'say', ""'Cut"", 'When', 'will', 'stories', 'matter', 'more', 'again', 'special', 'effects', 'no', 'longer', 'matter', 'taste', 'Not', 'really', 'matter', 'unasked', 'addiction', 'twig', 'way', 'bent', 'Recent', 'generations', 'have', 'known', 'little', 'else', 'one', 'speed', 'essential', 'technologically', 'dominated', 'time', 'leading', 'rapidity', 'movement', 'thought', 'deed', 'No', 'seeming', 'time', 'smell', 'roses', 'anymore', 'daily', 'diet', 'days', 'anymore', 'disaster', 'disasters', 'man-made', 'acts', 'God', 'are', 'backyards', 'anymore', 'thanks', 'technological', 'tools', 'Last', 'nowhere', 'least', 'are', 'unimaginable', 'horrors', 'forever', 'caught-on-film', 'cinematic-seeming', 'exploding', 'collapsing', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'nightmares', 'future', 'ones', 'have', 'impacted', 'EVERYTHING', 'mind', 'mortality', 'morality', 'movies', 'movies', 'entertainments', 'are', 'now', 'packed', 'even', 'worse', 'visions', 'total', 'immolation', 'seemingly', 'subconsciously', 'prepare', 'precarious', 'world', 'tomorrow', 'cataclysms', 'also', 'act', 'catharsis', 'what', 'already', 'been', 'lived', 'witnessed', 'forever', 'seared', 'collective', 'conscious', 'sub', 'as', 'well', 'movies', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'skyscrapers', 'collapse', 'bombs', 'go', 'off', 'will', 'be', 'hero', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'was', 'movie', 'say', 'so', 'many', 'when', 'interviewed', 'disaster', 'been', 'witnessed', 'would', 'seem', 'then', 'many', 'not', 'most', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'simply', 'entertainment', 'longer', 'moreso', 'unspecified', 'unstated', 'mission', 'inoculate', 'coming', 'Armageddon', 'next', 'Holocaust', 'movies', 'sort', 'am', 'speaking', 'do', 'not', 'simply', 'assist', 'viewers', 'dealing', 'chaos', 'calamity', 'Life', 'Addiction', 'alas', 'too', 'often', 'actualization', '3-D', 'attempt', 'actualize', 'short', 'Almost', 'being', 'able', 'reach', 'out', 'touch', '3-D', 'CGI', 'bomb', 'close', 'cigar', 'one', 'dangers', 'inherent', 'majority', 'action-addictive', 'movies', 'today.We', 'are', 'addictive', 'personalities', 'world', 'away', 'faster', 'faster', 'much', 'more', 'disposable', 'anymore', 'enduring', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'way', 'end', 'addiction', 'introduce', 'new', 'one', 'humanity', 'truly', 'being', 'lost', 'technologic', 'movie', 'such', 'MAN', 'OF', 'STEEL', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'more', 'humanity', 'more', 'humor', 'more', 'fun', 'more', 'delight', 'more', 'awe', 'yes', 'more', 'love', 'way', 'less', 'CGI', 'action', 'far', 'Alas', 'merely', 'addiction', 'mind-numbing', 'sense-deadening', 'emotionless', 'brainless', 'action', 'Action', 'costs', 'costs', 'So', 'having', 'ten', 'minutes', 'value', 'not', 'movie', 'madness']",N/A

The parents were portrayed superbly; Costner and Lane have always been favorites.I have been a follower of the Superman story since B.C. and I like the new take on the further development on Krypton. The story line was interesting: finally getting to learn the details of the interrelationships of all the adversaries. Superman uses some of the affects from the Matrix, the metal attackers, and also has Superman finding himself similarly to how Batman did in his wanderings: the obviousness of copying is jarring. I gave it four stars for a great try. Too bad that they gave it all up with the simplistic last half.

Although I&#8217;m a fan of comics and like most people, I love when a movie lives up to the original comic/graphic novel &#8211; I had no such expectations for Superman.  Mainly because Superman was introduced back in 1938; at 76 years old, I couldn&#8217;t imagine how they would make Superman&#8230; super.  I expected boring.  Aside from his super powers, his character is hokey and has become the foundation for every tired comic clich&eacute; ever.  Seriously, he puts on glasses and suddenly no one recognizes him??&#8230;  Thank God for the creative genius of Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan.  And to top it off, there is this delicious eye candy by the name of Henry Cavill (who also happened to be a very good actor).  Instead of hokey, they made Superman a Gentleman (which is lacking in our modern world); and it worked because seriously, if a man with the kind of powers that Superman possessed were anything but gentle&#8230; he&#8217;d be the ultimate nemesis.I had first thought that Russell Crowe would have a small introductory part, but he was a huge part of the movie &#8211; which I believe is one of the reasons why this movie was intense.  Russell Crowe is a great actor and he makes any movie more memorable.  Amy Adams was wonderful as Lois Lane (she played a strong independent woman; not just someone sitting around waiting for her &#8220;superman&#8221;).  But my favorite was Michael Shannon as General Zod.  If you have ever seen him as Nelson on HBO&#8217;s Boardwalk Empire, then you know this guy does crazy evil perfectly!Superman, Man of Steel was dark enough to make needing a super hero believable.

The extended battle scenes are ludicrous.The lead actor is silly and has no screen magnetism, but maybe he must have slept with someone to get cast in the lead. His body looks great, but so does everyone in Hollywood, where people spend days working out to be on screen, so that is NO excuse to cast them in a movie, unless they occupy the casting couch. His screams of effort in the movie are pathetic (I blame the Director for that stupidity).The man playing General Zod is silly, too, and sounds like Kenneth McMillan, a character actor with a very distinguished past in Hollywood, but again, Zach Snyder, as he did in WATCHMEN, miscasts an entire movie, with bland actors who don't scare or inspire ANYONE...The music score in the film, by Hans Zimmer, is musical leprosy, and completely tuneless.

Man of Steel is much deeper than &#34;Superman smashes sh&$&#34;.  It covers the clash between two cultures, one based on predetermined order and purpose and another that embraces free will and the being trapped in the middle with the power to move the needle in either direction.Ignore any of the negative remarks on about this, they are from inconsolable nerds and the feeble minded who have no emotional depth beyond being hungry, horny,  And this is an emotional movie, sophisticated enough that your average child and emotionally stunted adult will have completely missed the nuances as well as the on the nose tells.  Pa Kent's gentle smile as he realizes that he's going to die, that he's choosing to sacrifice himself for a young man who just yelled at him and reminded him that he's not his father.  Ma Kent's broken heart masked with a smile and false excitement when Clark tells her that he's found his parents.There's a lot going on in this movie, and it's sad that so many people and critics were blind to it all and just complained about things that were simply stupid.

I finally decided to give it five stars because Amazon's rating system has five stars equaling ""I love it.""First, the packaging....If you want something that can be put on display in your man-cave, and you're a Superman fan, this is great to have. The Blu-Ray discs and DVDs are in a fold-out sleeve in the shape of Superman's ""S"" shield. As you unfold the sleeve, you're treated to the main actors in the movie. The box is metal and in the shape of Superman's ""S"" shield. It holds the DVDs and an acrylic stand. The stand is two-part clear acrylic with magnets along the back to hold the display case in place. The base is in the shape of the ""S"" shield, and when the display is resting on the stand, only the box and base are visible. The only complaint I have is that the two pieces fit together VERY tightly. Do not try to force them! I sent it back once because while trying to get the two pieces together, the base cracked. The new pieces are likewise a very tight fit, so be careful. When assembled though, it sits nicely on a shelf and holds your movie. It's more of a display piece than anything, and is a very nice bonus to owning the movie.Now for the movie and its rendition on BD/DVD....The picture quality of the 3D movie I watched was fine, and the sound was good. I'm not a discriminating audiophile, so I can't comment on details of the audio other than the sound was immersive on my 5.1 surround-system. Picture clarity was great, and it appears the transition from screen to disc was done nicely. I watched the 3D version, and it was fine on my passive 3D TV. You get the 3D movie on BD, the regular HD release on BD, the same movie on DVD (which is handy if you have TV or portable unit somewhere with only DVD capability), and a disc of extras. You also get an Ultraviolet code that allows you to register a digital copy of the movie. I use the Flixter service, and it seemed to work fine. Using the Ultraviolet service is not self-explanatory. You need to create an account for yourself at Ultraviolet (they keep a record of which movies you are licensed to view) and create an account at a service that actually streams the movie (I chose Flixter), then link the two services together. You then enter the code at the secondary service (Flixter, in my case), and the movie is added to your library in Ultraviolet. From the service (again, in my case, Flixter), you can stream the movie to any device that has the app (tablets, smart TV, etc.) or computer. I tried it and it works fine. I'm now registered for this movie and can stream it to my laptop, tablet, etc.I enjoyed the movie itself, but it's not without flaws. From a pure action-movie perspective, it's very good. The plot gets a bit convoluted, and the action scenes towards the end are overwhelming after a while. But there's also some very good scenes that are a bit quieter, and the overall acting is very good. Henry Cavill plays a very good Clark Kent/Superman and Amy Adams is refreshing as Lois Lane, choosing to portray her more subtly than is normal. The rest of the cast is good, and there's many heartfelt moments throughout the movie. That said, it's debatable whether it actually is a ""good"" rendition of Superman. During key battles, there's a lot of destruction that many feel a ""true"" Superman would have tried to steer away from civilians. Some people like this shift towards realism, some don't. It's a purely personal and subjective opinion, so I won't dwell on it longer.In the end, I'll rate this particular product five stars. I'd honestly give it about four and a half because the acrylic stand is difficult to assemble and can break if you're not careful, but you can't give half stars, so I'll round up to five.

I remember watching the Christopher Reeves version on TV and LOVING IT!  But I went back when I got my blu-ray player and watched it again.  As a grown up looking at it, that version aged horribly.  But more than that; the villains were simply too comical (no pun intended).  I never felt threatened.  Plus I've ALWAYS had a problem with the &#34;disguise&#34;; I mean he's what? 6'2&#34; and built like a wall?!?!??!  And no one would notice him?!With Superman Returns, the studios tried to pay homage to that version and people complained.  Too slow, too sappy, too...whatever.  Superman is an incredibly difficult hero to get right.  I think they did a pretty good job on this one.  They tried to make the movie more relevant to this day and age, and a little less predictable.  The director stated in an interview that there were two things he was concerned about:  1) The red panties on the outside of his costume.  2) Kryptonite.  They tried to make the underwear work, but it just didn't, so the director got rid of them.  And a lot of people felt that to give someone such amazing powers and then have them fall over from what is essentially an allergic reaction to kryptonite was even sillier.  To do a movie without both shows plenty of balls, IMO.Finally an all out war between Supes and General Zod and Faora + the other aliens sporting alien weapons, should result in PLENTY of destruction with millions being killed.  Sure, he should have taken Zod out to a deserted area, but I have a feeling that Zod would not have given up this advantage so easily.All in all, given the ridiculousness of this character, I think they did a good job of balancing the mythos while giving him some REAL problems.",4,Better than ANY previous Superman movie...,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,1770,"['one', 'thing', 'want', 'say', 'not', 'troll', 'e-mail', 'remember', 'watching', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'version', 'TV', 'LOVING', 'IT', 'went', 'back', 'when', 'got', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'watched', 'again', 'grown', 'up', 'looking', 'version', 'aged', 'horribly', 'more', 'villains', 'were', 'simply', 'too', 'comical', 'pun', 'intended', 'never', 'felt', 'threatened', ""'ve"", 'ALWAYS', 'had', 'problem', '34', 'disguise', '34', 'mean', 'what', '6', '2', '34', 'built', 'wall', 'one', 'would', 'notice', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'studios', 'tried', 'pay', 'homage', 'version', 'people', 'complained', 'Too', 'slow', 'too', 'sappy', 'too', 'Superman', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'hero', 'get', 'right', 'think', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'one', 'tried', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'relevant', 'day', 'age', 'little', 'less', 'predictable', 'director', 'stated', 'interview', 'were', 'two', 'things', 'was', 'concerned', '1', 'red', 'panties', 'outside', 'costume', '2', 'Kryptonite', 'tried', 'make', 'underwear', 'work', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'director', 'got', 'rid', 'lot', 'people', 'felt', 'give', 'someone', 'such', 'amazing', 'powers', 'then', 'have', 'fall', 'what', 'essentially', 'allergic', 'reaction', 'kryptonite', 'was', 'even', 'sillier', 'do', 'movie', 'shows', 'plenty', 'balls', 'IMO.Finally', 'out', 'war', 'Supes', 'General', 'Zod', 'Faora', '+', 'other', 'aliens', 'sporting', 'alien', 'weapons', 'should', 'result', 'PLENTY', 'destruction', 'millions', 'being', 'killed', 'Sure', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'Zod', 'deserted', 'area', 'have', 'feeling', 'Zod', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'advantage', 'so', 'easily.All', 'given', 'ridiculousness', 'character', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'balancing', 'mythos', 'giving', 'REAL', 'problems']",N/A

1562124,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B008JFUPFI,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 6]","****1/2Comic book purists may well balk at 'Man of Steel,&#34; writer David S. Goyer and director Zack Snyders's radically re-imagined take on the Superman story (with a hefty assist from Christopher Nolan). However, those who think that even a universally recognized slice of Americana could use a little updating every now and again will find much of interest in this new film.This one starts off fairly traditionally, as we are once again shown the origin story of the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes who would later grow up to be the super hero famous for being faster than a speeding bullet and being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. We see again how, with their planet Krypton on the verge of being blown to smithereens, the baby's parents (Russell Crowe and Ayulet Zurer) launch him into outer space in a ship programmed to land on a planet called Earth, where he will go on to be found by a loving Kansas couple (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) and raised as their very own. And how this baby, dubbed Clark Kent, will grow up to be a man with super powers that he first will not understand but over time will come to accept and to use for good by rescuing the innocent and vanquishing the evil.But after following the conventional path for a time - and just as you're settling in for a rehash of the famous 1978 movie version of the same material - &#34;Man of Steel&#34; suddenly verges off onto radically untrod territory. First of all, this Clark Kent is a much more psychologically conflicted creature than we are used to finding in depictions of Superman, who hitherto has been one of the sunnier, less brooding and more well-adjusted figures in the superhero canon. This Clark is genuinely struggling with his place in the universe, wondering why it is that he is &#34;different&#34; from all the other kids and why his parents keep telling him not to let anyone else know of all the marvelous feats of strength and heightened perception he is capable of doing. Even more radically, the Lois Lane (Amy Adams) in this version, while still a reporter for the Daily Planet, is onto Clark right from the start and, in fact, pursues him to find out what it is that makes him tick. No double identities, no coy disguises for this couple (if one could ever call a pair of black-rimmed glasses and a fedora a disguise).&#34;Man of Steel,&#34; in many ways, plays less like a superhero movie and more like an alien-invasion thriller, as Clark is reluctantly forced to reveal his identity and special powers to the world when one of the survivors from Krypton, the evil General Zod (Michael Shannon), comes to Earth, all guns a-blazing, intent on making it his own.At first, Henry Cavill seems a bit stiff as the man of steel (pardon the pun), but, as that moniker suggests, that might not actually be a bad thing, for it underlines the earnestness and innate goodness of the character in a way that a more emotive performance likely would not.I must also add that among recent blockbusters, &#34;Man of Steel&#34; easily has the most spectacular special effects and the most exciting action scenes, bar none. Yet, Snyder clearly has his sights set higher than a mere comic book fantasy. The flashback scenes, recalling Clark's childhood spent on the farm, have an almost Terrance Malick, impressionistic feel to them, as they evoke the poetic richness of nature. This enhances the mythic quality of the storytelling and neutralizes the cheesiness that is regularly so much a part of the genre.To those who complain that this is not the Superman story they've known and grown up with, I'd respond by asking what the point would be of remaking an already overly familiar film if you're just going to do the same old thing anyway.

What I will state in this review is the good and the bad regarding this 2013 summer epic.1. Henry Cavill did a fantastic job, I really liked his performance and he is worthy of the role the late Christopher Reeve made famous.2. The action and drama, including a very different but detailed take on the planet Krypton and Superman's origins are explained in much better detail (just like Christian Bale's Batman films) then the original films.3. The special effects and computer animation are great.4. I did very much appriciate the inclusion of the US & Canadian Militaries in this film, especially their very active roles in fighting the villains.  The fantasy heroes are depicted fighting side by side with the real heroes of this world.5. The plot angle involving General Zod's character is much more convincing and more complicated then the original &#34;Superman II's&#34; version with actor Terrance Stamp's classic work.6.

1562184,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B008JFUPFI,Sean Pasek,"[7, 17]","***SPOILER ALERT!!!***Superman is arguably the most iconic comic book hero in the world, and he has been for many years.  People all over the world know who he is.  Superman may be the only superhero who is not thought of as an American hero, but as a world hero.  Why is that?I collected comic books for over 15 years.  I grew up watching ""The Adventures of Superman"" and the Superman movies in the 70s and 80s.  No other hero embodies what it means to be a hero more than Superman.  He embodies it so much that he has often been ridiculed over the years for being cheesy, a boy-scout, or just plain boring.  Superman embodies all that is good...so much so that over the last 35 years, the writers have even endowed him with a ""Messiah-complex.""  We can always trust Superman to do the right thing when it comes to the safety and welfare of others.  These have been timeless qualities that make him who he is, as much as brooding and incredible deductive reasoning make Batman who he is.""Man of Steel"" attempts to change much of Superman's character.  The writers are trying desperately to make Superman more realistic and gritty; more of what they feel the world wants Superman to be.  I am a Peace Corps volunteer in Macedonia.  I lost count of how many people here, in this small country, have seen the film and asked me, ""why did they change him?  That isn't Superman.""  One thing that I liked about the film was that the ""S"" symbol is defined as ""hope.""  And that is the one thing that Superman has always meant to so many people.Unfortunately, ""Man of Steel"" gives us a Superman film that is practically all flash and very little substance.  Given the incredible cast that they had to work with, I was disappointed in how little time and development is given to Clark, Lois, Perry, and others.We get a fairly impressive scene on Krypton.  No longer is Krypton a crystallized world, but one of metal and technology.  The writers decide to take a page out of the ""Matrix"" playbook as people on Krypton are not born, but grown.  Kal-El (referred to laughably as Kal, which makes me think of Titanic), is the first naturally born Kryptonian in thousands of years.  As we know, Kal-El is sent to earth as the planet explodes, but not before Zod and his minions are banished and the explosion of Krypton frees them.The film opens with Clark wandering around in the north somewhere.  Yes, he leaves his mother behind on the farm.  We aren't given much of an explanation as to why.  Jonathan Kent has all but instilled a sense of paranoia within Clark; so much so that Jonathan sacrifices his life to preserve Clark's secret.  This is done is a very implausible manner.  Jonathan is about to be killed by a tornado (notice that his hair doesn't even move when he's within a few hundred feet of it!), and Clark stands by and watches, even though Jonathan does hold up his hand and shakes his head.  I haven't seen a version of Clark Kent, until now, who would stand idly by and watch his own father be killed.  In fact, I don't know many people who would do this, if they felt that they had the chance to save a loved one; secret be damned.  Not to mention that Clark has super-speed and could have saved Jonathan without anyone seeing him.Lois Lane is given an assignment in the north to cover a scientific-military operation.  She sees Clark in the distance and wanders out in -40 degree weather without a hat or facial protection.  I have been in temperatures that low before, and your ears would be frost-bitten within ten minutes, and Lois isn't even shivering.  Just like that, she happens upon a large alien craft where Clark is finally introduced to Jor-El.  Naturally, Clark ends up having to save her life when Kryptonian defenses see Lois as an intruder and attempt to kill her.  We have a couple of minutes of Lois & Clark time before we shift the story again.Virtually the entire second-half of the film is a CGI-action fest (which is okay at best).  Zod and his minions (easily over 20) come looking for Kal-El and decide to make Earth their new utopia.  Here is where things really get pushed over the edge.  Up until now, we have had little character development and suddenly Superman who has just mastered flying, is thrown into the frying pan as a large invasion force descends upon the Earth.  The amount of destruction and deaths are higher than in any other Superman feature film.  I also lost count of the number of times Superman would hit one Kryptonian fifty feet above the ground, sail for a few miles, and then back the other way we come.  Zod, a great military general, only allows two other Kryptonians to attack Superman, when he could send over a dozen of his people to different points on the globe and thus, incapacitate Superman's ability to save the planet.The action scenes, frankly, were not that impressive to me.  After a few times of people slamming into each other and through buildings, it became tedious.  Frankly, I wasn't emotionally invested in Superman.  There wasn't enough character development for me to care.  Lois, a reporter, is even given a military mission.  I guess there weren't any military personnel qualified to do it; to put a Kryptonian computerized device into a slot.I also wish the flying scenes were better.  Superman and Superman II still have the best flying sequences of any Superman film, and there was no CGI.  Christopher Reeve contorted and turned his body to mimic flying.  We see Henry Cavill straight on a few times and then these fast, distant fly-bys.I, like many others, also have a problem with Superman's ""killing"" scene.  Had there been no other options, I might have considered that Superman had no choice.  But that isn't the case here.  He could have turned Zod's head in a safer direction (if you're strong enough to break someone's neck, then you can turn their head), or he could have grabbed him and flown him out of the train station.  In other words, he had options.  And even though Superman is overcome with grief for his action, it simply doesn't work.If you're going to do a good Superman film, then you first have to know the character.  Zack Snyder and the writers clearly don't.  They tried to change and mold an iconic character to make him relevant (in their minds) to today's world.  For me, it didn't work.  We are given a transformers-type action fest that detracts from the story rather than enhance it.Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, Diane Lane, and Kevin Costner are given very little screen time. Cavill makes the most of what little time he does have.  Michael Shannon's Zod is the best and most developed character of the film along with Russell Crowe's Jor-El.I was really looking forward to seeing this film, based on what I saw in the trailers.  And again, I was disappointed that a movie that is nearly two and a half hours long, failed to give me a Superman and characters that I care about.  If you can't do some character development and go deeper within that amount of time, then as a writer, you might want to look into a new profession.I will say that the music in this film is pretty good, but it's hard to top the epic score of John Williams that exemplifies power, greatness, and hope.For now, I will stick with Superman I & II.  They may be older films, but they are still classic films that work today and give us the Superman that most of us know and love.  Perhaps someday, we'll get a film that does justice to the world's greatest superhero.",2,All Flash And Little Substance Leaves This Superman Film Bare,1382227200,"10 20,

1562186,AMP6LJ9WW3YC,B008JFUPFI,sebastian crane,"[6, 10]","So, a Superman reboot. One thing I liked about Superman Returns was that it was an intelligent and elegant film with beautiful visuals of Superman and the city itself. Like a lot of people, one thing I didn't like is that there just wasn't enough ""pulse pounding"" sequences. Well, you definitely get all the mayhem and destruction you could want in Man of Steel. And yet, now I want some of the elegance that Bryan Singer was able to bring to the Superman concept. Maybe I'm just fickle, but can't there be both? The following comments I make not as a criticism but as a personal reflection. Now, I knew long before I saw the film that Zack Snyder hadn't used the John Williams music, but in my heart, the filmic Superman just doesn't exist without the genius of John Williams's score. I can't believe how well it holds up over the years--it sounds like it could have been written today, and Superman Returns was all the better for using it. The score for Man of Steel felt like your typical action movie crescendos and thumping. (I can only remember one, understated theme from the movie.) In a way, the soaring Williams themes felt like they gave Superman the ability to come alive and fly, since the association between the character concept and the music was so innately, strongly irresistible. That's Williams's gift. He has a profound ability to understand the source material and bring it alive with music. Would Jaws have been as effective if it didn't have that unbelievable, two-note theme that you could come out of the theater humming to yourself? And in E.T. you can instantly see the scene of the bikes flying through the air when that music plays. Are there any music sequences in Man of Steel that make you instantly remember the scene? The word for Williams's many iconic themes and melodies is, ""indelible."" I admire Hans Zimmer and the many other talented film composers out there,  but I don't think, in my lifetime anyway, there will be any film composer who captures the essence of film magic and the characters that inhabit that world in the way that John Williams has over his career. I say that understanding that there are plenty of people who turn their noses up at a melodic, gossebump score, the same way they turn their noses up at Tchaikovsky, and go to bed at night dreaming of having Alban Berg or Arnold Shoenberg as film composers.That said, I liked the movie for what it is. But I would say only about half of the substance of the film felt like a Superman film. And I definitely understand the reasoning. The filmmakers wanted to break from the tradition of Superman movies, not be bound by the filmic tropes that have been so firmly attached to it, and to see what comes out. (One thing they did keep, which I like, was the Superman-as-Christ figure, with his crucifixion poses; the scene of him in the church seeking guidance as he sits directly in front of a stained-glass window depicting Jesus in Gethsemane praying to God for strength and guidance; and the ""He will be like a God to them"" line...) Let me say this, I've figured that Zack Snyder's style is something most people either love or hate. Me, I'm a lover. I like watching his imagination and visual sense on the screen. (I think Watchmen and 300 are both great films). So, for what it is, this is a very solid action movie. For me personally, can I say that this a fulfilling Superman movie? No, I don't think I can. I think the creators went a few steps too far in re-inventing the representation of Superman on film. There was nothing as elegant as Singer's version, or as operatic as Richard Donner's vision, and no moment as singularly powerful as Superman's harrowing reaction to Lois Lane's death in the original film.As I was watching, I was wondering if there is a metaphor in here regarding those breathing masks that Zod and his gang have to wear. When they get removed, the character becomes disoriented and has to adjust to Earth's ""atmospherics."" Are we, the audience, wearing masks of preconception that the movie rips away, forcing us to adapt to this new vision of Superman? Maybe so, but I don't think I'll be re-watching this movie that much because--and I admit it, I did go in with preconceptions-- I felt punched in the gut when it was over and I didn't get to hear the Fanfare, or the Superman march theme, or the romance theme. And yes, I know that sequels are forthcoming, but to see the mild-mannered reporter only at the very end, left me feeling a little empty too. A lot has been made about the seriousness with which Christopher Reeve took the role (even to the astonishment of the cast and crew). As and actor somehow Reeve was able to separate the two consciousness, Clark Kent/Superman, that the metaphor I think is most important in the Superman mythos is that there is a wellspring of goodness in all of us (Singer carries this forth beautifully by make the James Marsden not an antagonist, but a character who represents the potential for heroism in the common man). As an aside, this contrasts with Batman, who commonly represents the darkness that exists in all of us.Regarding the carnage, it was thrilling to watch, but I wonder if the pontificating in that movie Clerks about the genocide of innocents when the Death Star was destroyed by Luke Skywalker is applicable here. That is, the good guys won, but at the cost of killing perhaps a million people. In Man of Steel, yes we're glad Superman wins, but he was probably responsible for the deaths of untold thousands of people. One thing the Christopher Reeve character had to contend with in Superman II is that he had to protect the people WHILE fighting the 3 Kryptonians. His regard for the lives of the people is what prompts him to leave the city so that the fight can take place elsewhere and won't endanger the lives of the people of Metropolis.C'mon though, who's going to believe that the reporter with the world's most distinctive jawline isn't the same as the Super Hero with the world's most distinctive jawline. Christopher Reeve thoroughly understood the dichotomy of Superman--that Clark Kent and Superman really are two separate consciences-- and he could play that beautifully. Indeed, as I said, I think THAT--the dual nature of Christ and Man--is at the center of the Superman mythos, in the same way Superman and Clark Kent are at once both separate and the same, and the way humans have the potential to be both common and heroic. Brandon Routh didn't understand it quite as well, and I'm skeptical that Henry Cavill is going to be able to pull it off. But hey, I could be wrong. I was one who liked the casting of Routh. He had a good ""look"" for Superman. I wish he could have continued in the role. Once again, the thing I think Man of Steel misses is that Superman is a kind of foil for Batman. While Batman explores the hidden darkness within us all, Superman, to me, has always represented the potential for courage, nobility, and goodness within us all. Although the movie is dark, and I'm glad that it is relatively free of wisecracks and stupid comic relief, the tone of the film seems to undercut the theme I just mentioned. Comments about the music can be added here too. The Williams theme was inspiring to the viewer (and it was the mandate upon Superman that he inspire the people of earth, not fight their fights for them), and it was, well, quintessentially American sounding. (While Superman has powers because he is Kryptonian, but he gets his ""aw, shucks"" moral values from his Middle-American upbringing). Hans Zimmer, while he produced a rich score, it reinforces the darkness of the film, and will never be one of those ""iconic"" scores.Objectively: Spectacular action and a story that benefits from a prepackaged archetypal narrative. Good visual sense, and I like the cutting back and forth between the present and the past, similar to what Christopher Nolan did in Batman Begins. I like that the sedition of Zod and his group is more fleshed out on Krypton. It's Missing that ""something special,"" and I'm not referring just to the music. I love the very brief Christopher Reeve cameo in Cavill's face. The film does seem to borrow an awful lot in the visuals--the Pandora-esque vision of Krypton; the repeated Matrix allusions. Oh, and has Jimmy Olsen been replaced by a Jenny Olsen? I can't exactly tell.Personally: What can I say? I'm a child of the 80's. I feel like a little bit of me was ossified after watching the movie. The ongoing saga has taken a dramatic turn, and the old Superman has been laid to rest, and I mourn.I do recommend the movie.",4,Two different results if judged personally versus

1562187,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B008JFUPFI,Sebastian Fernandez,"[1, 3]","Being a big fan of Superman, I was looking forward to this new movie, especially after seeing the great job that was done with the Batman movies in the last few years. When this film started my hopes were being met, since I encountered a very nice setup to the story, and I was appreciating the nice blend of original story with a some new elements and a very imaginative depiction of Krypton.The beginnings of the story in Earth was also good, with Clark discovering his powers and learning about where he came from, the relationship with his parents in Earth, and the fear of being discovered, while at the same time having the need to help others. But sadly, this is when thing start to go awry.The confrontations with General Zod and his group are a big part of this film, and here I felt that they decided to put the story in second place and focus on special effects. It may be cool when you see the first building collapse, or huge explosions take place, but after seeing this over and over, things get old pretty fast. I'd rather see a fight between Superman and Zod, than see one hit the other, five building collapse one after the other, going back to the fight for the next hit, etc.Overall this was an OK film, but it definitely did not meet the high expectations I had. A clear test for me is when I think about which movie I'd rather see, this one or the one from 1978, and in my case the answer is that I prefer the old one. Therefore, it is clear something went wrong in the way they decided to create this new film.",3,We got it. You have special effects.

I'm sure they are hoping to make at least 3 or 4 of these new ones.I am definitely interested in the sequel, Batman vs. Superman. I think Ben Affleck will do just fine as Batman. I don't mind when movies stray from cannon and I don't compare this to the classic ones or comics. Obviously, no one can ultimately compare to Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, but I think Henry Cavill does just fine, and he is definitely easy on the eyes. ;) I have no issues with his portrayal, the writing, or the directing.

As for the movie itself, I went in with high expectations. Although the last Zack Snyder film I saw, I didn't like, I had high hopes for Man of Steel. I was richly rewarded. This is a spectacular film on many levels. The music alone is so epic that I just can't stop listening to the soundtrack, it's beautiful, calming, powerful, thoughtful, sweeping, majestic, etc, just like the film itself. It is also such a visual feast that I can't wait to watch it again to pick up things I missed. Henry Cavill did an incredible job as Clark/Kal-El/Superman. Whoah, poor Superman has three personalities, not just two like most Superheroes. Anyway, he looked amazing, and his acting was perfect for the part, IMO. Russell Crowe did a good job as Jor-El, and I liked the scenes on Krypton a lot. It was nice to bring more of Krypton into the cinematic world of Superman. Kevin Costner did an excellent job as Jonathan Kent. Pa Kent's contribution to this film had some controversial elements, but it felt real to me, and I thought Costner' execution of the role was brilliant. Michael Shannon's Zod was very good. I liked his Zod a lot. But, I felt that newcomer Antje Traue as Faroa Ul, Zod's lieutenant was the best villain in the film. She was down right creepy cool! She was more of an enigma than Zod. Her personality was ruthless, and knowing less about her and her motives/motivation made her more intriguing to me. Traue did a marvelous job of making her screen time memorable. I hope she makes it back from the Phantom Zone in upcoming films. Her fight scene with Superman in Smallville was the best one in the entire movie, IMO.

1562204,A3V43IU15LA3HA,B008JFUPFI,snow47,"[13, 24]","This is the modern Superman film that we have been waiting for. I cannot emphasize that enough. It is not a flawless masterpiece - in spite of the obvious similarities and parallels, this is not on quite the same level as Batman Begins - however, it absolutely gets the conceptual approach that was needed to take this character and re-launch him as a realistic, real-world entity in the heavier landscape of the twenty-first century. Not everyone likes this, but that just goes to demonstrate an ideological divide among viewers.Superman has spent far too long chained to nostalgia for either his 1930s/1940s origins and/or the aesthetic and tone of Richard Donner's iconic 1978 film. Even in 2006 Superman Returns was looking decades back into the past for inspiration. Not that there is anything wrong with reveling in a franchise's heritage. But that should never consume a character. Man of Steel takes the core concepts and brings them forward to the present, and it does a wonderful job of it.I used the word ""realistic"" a few sentences back - of course a being with superhuman powers is not a real thing in our world. But this film is science fiction. It is a first-contact story, designed to show how such an event might play out if it did occur. Thus, the characters (all of them, including Superman and the other the Kryptonians) act and react like real people, because they are real people. This version of Krypton involves more of a focus on technology, but it is just advanced technology, not magic. As the saying goes, any sufficiently advanced technology at first seems that way.Again, I do not consider this film a masterpiece. The script could be better, for one thing, and some of the editing is a bit jumpy. And so forth. But the thing is, Man of Steel's virtues far, far, far outweigh any of its weaknesses. It is beautifully rendered in the cinematography and visual effects, wonderfully cast with a group of terrific actors, and contrary to what some may say, has substantial heart and emotion at its core.There is the issue of the ending, but for me, it is a complete non-issue. Again, this is intended to be a realistic take on Superman. He is not a god, he is not immune to mistakes or shortcomings, and he is just starting to fully embrace the implications of his heritage and his abilities when everything goes crazy, and the earth and humanity are basically in danger of destruction. Nothing about what happens contradicts the identity of the character. Those who disown this film because of the levels of action or destruction are completely missing the point, if I may be so bold as to say so.The main thing is that in spite of its imperfections, Man of Steel is a very special film. It is a new type of superhero film. It looks different, feels different, is different. We are fortunate that we were not given just another cartoonish episode or just a retread of what has already been done in the past. This is the opening chapter of a new world. Not everyone will love it or appreciate its qualities, but this mythology is moving forward, and I am energized and inspired to be along for the ride. If you have not seen it yet, approach it with an open mind, treat it like it is really happening, and it may very well take you someplace beautiful and meaningful.",5,"A Beautiful, Inspiring New Type of Realism-Driven Superhero Film",1377993600,"09 1, 2013",2013,3293,"['modern', 'Superman', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'can', 'not', 'emphasize', 'enough', 'not', 'flawless', 'masterpiece', 'spite', 'obvious', 'similarities', 'parallels', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'level', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'however', 'absolutely', 'conceptual', 'approach', 'was', 'needed', 'take', 'character', 're-launch', 'realistic', 'real-world', 'entity', 'heavier', 'landscape', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'Not', 'everyone', 'just', 'demonstrate', 'ideological', 'divide', 'viewers.Superman', 'spent', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'chained', 'nostalgia', '1930s/1940s', 'origins', 'and/or', 'aesthetic', 'tone', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'iconic', '1978', 'film', 'Even', '2006', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'was', 'looking', 'decades', 'back', 'past', 'inspiration', 'Not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'reveling', 'franchise', 'heritage', 'should', 'never', 'consume', 'character', 'Man', 'Steel', 'core', 'concepts', 'forward', 'present', 'wonderful', 'job', 'it.I', 'used', 'word', 'realistic', 'few', 'sentences', 'back', 'course', 'being', 'superhuman', 'powers', 'not', 'real', 'thing', 'world', 'film', 'science', 'fiction', 'first-contact', 'story', 'designed', 'show', 'how', 'such', 'event', 'might', 'play', 'out', 'did', 'occur', 'Thus', 'characters', 'including', 'Superman', 'other', 'Kryptonians', 'act', 'react', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'version', 'Krypton', 'more', 'focus', 'technology', 'just', 'advanced', 'technology', 'not', 'magic', 'saying', 'sufficiently', 'advanced', 'technology', 'first', 'way.Again', 'do', 'not', 'consider', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'script', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'one', 'thing', 'editing', 'bit', 'jumpy', 'so', 'forth', 'thing', 'Man', 'Steel', 'virtues', 'far', 'far', 'far', 'outweigh', 'weaknesses', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'cinematography', 'visual', 'effects', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'group', 'terrific', 'actors', 'contrary', 'what', 'may', 'say', 'substantial', 'heart', 'emotion', 'core.There', 'issue', 'ending', 'complete', 'non-issue', 'Again', 'intended', 'be', 'realistic', 'take', 'Superman', 'not', 'god', 'not', 'immune', 'mistakes', 'shortcomings', 'just', 'starting', 'fully', 'embrace', 'implications', 'heritage', 'abilities', 'when', 'everything', 'crazy', 'earth', 'humanity', 'are', 'basically', 'danger', 'destruction', 'Nothing', 'what', 'identity', 'character', 'who', 'disown', 'film', 'levels', 'action', 'destruction', 'are', 'completely', 'missing', 'point', 'may', 'be', 'so', 'bold', 'say', 'so.The', 'main', 'thing', 'spite', 'imperfections', 'Man', 'Steel', 'very', 'special', 'film', 'new', 'type', 'superhero', 'film', 'different', 'feels', 'different', 'different', 'are', 'fortunate', 'were', 'not', 'given', 'just', 'cartoonish', 'episode', 'just', 'retread', 'what', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'past', 'opening', 'chapter', 'new', 'world', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'love', 'appreciate', 'qualities', 'mythology', 'moving', 'forward', 'am', 'energized', 'inspired', 'be', 'along', 'ride', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'yet', 'approach', 'open', 'mind', 'treat', 'really', 'happening', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'take', 'someplace', 'beautiful', 'meaningful']",N/A

Similarly, in every other incarnation of Superman, Clark probably would have found a way to save his father rather than standing by and letting a tornado sweep him away into oblivion.

I rather have him to play superman in this movie, instead of him.  No offense, but I really enjoy this movie, it has an excellent plot, great character and great action.  I have to give Amy Adams full credit for this movie, she did a great job playing Lois Lane.  So does, the rest of the actors who plays in the superman franchise.  I also like the music in this movie, it was really amazing.  One thing I also respect in this movie, it was a lot different than the superman movie with christopher reeve.  Where Clark Kent travels to the artic to find the fortress of solitude and starts his kryptonian training.  But here it shows Clark traveling around the world, saving people and catching bad guys as an anyomus superhero before he heads to the fortress of solitude.  Lois Lane meets Clark Kent for the first time, before he became superman and knows his identity a lot faster than a few years.  It reminds me of Smallville Lois Lane meeting Clark Kent without the glasses before he became Superman.  That's the reason, why Amy Adams made an extraordinary performance in this movie.  This is an excellent movie that was box office gold, I can't wait for the sequel to start.",5,man of steel review,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,1841,"['seen', 'movie', 'three', 'four', 'times', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'look', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'movie', 'movie', 'star', 'cast', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'third', 'british', 'actor', 'play', 'american', 'superhero', 'Superman', 'had', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'play', 'Batman', 'was', 'favorite', 'also', 'have', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'play', 'Spider-man', 'two', 'guys', 'were', 'favorite', 'actors', 'play', 'two', 'top', 'american', 'superheroes', 'always', 'admired', 'offense', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'good', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'play', 'superman', 'miss', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'play', 'superman', 'rather', 'have', 'play', 'superman', 'movie', 'instead', 'offense', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'excellent', 'plot', 'great', 'character', 'great', 'action', 'have', 'give', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'full', 'credit', 'movie', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'So', 'rest', 'actors', 'who', 'plays', 'superman', 'franchise', 'also', 'music', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'amazing', 'One', 'thing', 'also', 'respect', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'different', 'superman', 'movie', 'christopher', 'reeve', 'Where', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'artic', 'find', 'fortress', 'solitude', 'kryptonian', 'training', 'here', 'Clark', 'traveling', 'world', 'saving', 'people', 'catching', 'bad', 'guys', 'anyomus', 'superhero', 'fortress', 'solitude', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'meets', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'first', 'time', 'became', 'superman', 'identity', 'lot', 'faster', 'few', 'years', 'Smallville', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'meeting', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'glasses', 'became', 'Superman', 'reason', 'why', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'made', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'movie', 'excellent', 'movie', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'gold', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'sequel', 'start']",N/A

At least that film had something going for it and the actor who played the character actually seemed like Superman.First, the pacing of this movie is horrible. It keeps jumping back and forth, back and forth. Seriously, let's get on with it already.It really has no originality and pretty much nothing going on for it plot wise at all. I like Henry Cavill, but I think he was a very poor choice for Superman. He doesn't play him well at all. In fact, through out most of the movie he doesn't even seem like the &#34;Man of Steel,&#34; he just seems like a sissy. Lois Lane in this movie was also really poorly cast in this movie and isn't believable in any way possible. Another bad thing about this movie is a lot of the fight scenes in it are just ridiculous and too long and drawn out. There's way too much emphasis on them. This movie really feels like nothing more than a Superman movie with a Dark Knight vibe to it, and not in a good way.Don't get me wrong, though. There are a few things I did like about this movie. The beginning with all the scenes on Krypton, along with Jor-El and General Zod are pretty cool.

1562229,A2MHGHI8NCSOXQ,B008JFUPFI,Stephen P. Suelzle,"[1, 6]","I liked this movie a lot.  Yes, it was a little different take on Superman than most modern people are used to, but not so different from the original.  Right away, I would like to say this to all the people that are upset about this Superman:  This character has been around for 70+ years and has gone through many changes and additions in that time.  The original Superman could not fly, only jump really far, and certainly couldn't hover.  He was not invulnerable, just really really tough.  He wasn't strong enough to lift or punch anything, just really really strong.  Many of his other powers weren't there in the beginning. He could get tired or hurt and had to sometimes strain to do something he was trying to do.  He wasn't perfect.  He got mad and sometimes he even did the wrong thing.  The point I'm making is that a character that has been around this long doesn't stay the same.  That's a good way to  stay interesting and to explore different aspects of the character.So, this Superman is a very good real take on him.  For those who were looking for a full blown Superman, this movie has something much more interesting, a Superman that is trying to discover what and who he is.  He wants to know what his relationship should be with his adopted world and is concerned about how they will treat him.  These are all issues that a real, human person might experience.  Christopher Reeve has always been my personal favorite for being the most like the Superman I imagined in the comics.  He also breathed a great deal of realness into the character.  The first two movies, especially are awesome Superman movies, even though the whole Krypton/Fortress of Solitude thing was completely reworked and reworked well.  The reason I mention all that is because this movie feels very related to those Christopher Reeve movies.  This Superman might be the one we would see before he was quite so sure, quite so calm, or quite so confident.  To me, its OK for our heroes (even super heroes) to be real people.Superman stands up for himself and makes us all proud.",5,"If you love the man in Superman, I would watch this movie.",1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,2069,"['liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'Yes', 'was', 'little', 'different', 'take', 'Superman', 'most', 'modern', 'people', 'are', 'used', 'not', 'so', 'different', 'original', 'Right', 'away', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'people', 'are', 'upset', 'Superman', 'character', 'been', '70+', 'years', 'gone', 'many', 'changes', 'additions', 'time', 'original', 'Superman', 'could', 'not', 'fly', 'only', 'jump', 'really', 'far', 'certainly', 'could', ""n't"", 'hover', 'was', 'not', 'invulnerable', 'just', 'really', 'really', 'tough', 'was', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'lift', 'punch', 'anything', 'just', 'really', 'really', 'strong', 'Many', 'other', 'powers', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'beginning', 'could', 'get', 'tired', 'hurt', 'had', 'sometimes', 'strain', 'do', 'something', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'got', 'mad', 'sometimes', 'even', 'did', 'wrong', 'thing', 'point', ""'m"", 'making', 'character', 'been', 'long', ""n't"", 'stay', 'same', 'good', 'way', 'stay', 'interesting', 'explore', 'different', 'aspects', 'character.So', 'Superman', 'very', 'good', 'real', 'take', 'who', 'were', 'looking', 'full', 'blown', 'Superman', 'movie', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'Superman', 'trying', 'discover', 'what', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'relationship', 'should', 'be', 'adopted', 'world', 'concerned', 'how', 'will', 'treat', 'are', 'issues', 'real', 'human', 'person', 'might', 'experience', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'always', 'been', 'personal', 'favorite', 'being', 'most', 'Superman', 'imagined', 'comics', 'also', 'breathed', 'great', 'deal', 'realness', 'character', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'especially', 'are', 'awesome', 'Superman', 'movies', 'even', 'whole', 'Krypton/Fortress', 'Solitude', 'thing', 'was', 'completely', 'reworked', 'reworked', 'well', 'reason', 'mention', 'movie', 'very', 'related', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'movies', 'Superman', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'would', 'see', 'was', 'quite', 'so', 'sure', 'quite', 'so', 'calm', 'quite', 'so', 'confident', 'OK', 'heroes', 'even', 'super', 'heroes', 'be', 'real', 'people.Superman', 'up', 'proud']",N/A

1562232,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,B008JFUPFI,Steven Hancock,"[2, 7]","Although I absolutely loveSuperman Returns, I realize now that doing it the way they did (Staying true to the feel of the 1978 Classic) would not be enjoyed by a modern movie-going audience. Now, seven years removed from the previous attempt to reignite the Superman franchise, Producer Christopher Nolan, Director of the acclaimedThe Dark Knight Trilogy (Batman Begins / The Dark Knight / The Dark Knight Rises) [Blu-ray]), teams up with ""Batman Begins"" screenwriter David S. Goyer, and Director Zack Snyder (Watchmen,300) to reboot the Superman saga for a modern audience. And overall, their effort, ""Man of Steel,"" delivers on the promise of making Superman accessible to a modern audience.The major problem the film has is, unlike ""Superman Returns,"" where the focus was on character and story, at the expense of action and spectacle, ""Man of Steel"" is the exact opposite, focusing on action and spectacle, at the expense of character and story. The filmmakers seemed to be working hard at making a ""Batman Begins"" version of a Superman film, which sadly does not entirely work. While the action and visual effects are awesome to behold, it turns out that there are just too many action sequences. And as a result, there is a good lack of character development and story. For me, I'm still trying to decide if I like actors in certain roles. Henry Cavill as Kal-el/Clark Kent/Superman is one of those I'm still trying to figure out. I'll admit, he does great with what character moments he has. But when we are thrust into action sequence after action sequence, it becomes hard to focus squarely on the characters. This movie could definitely have used either ten minutes less action and spectacle, or ten minutes more character and story, to help balance out the epic story that Nolan, Goyer and Snyder were attempting to tell.Despite these flaws, the movie still comes out as good. Although there are too many of them, the action is definitely exciting and, in some cases, unlike anything seen so far on film. And there are a number of good performances in the bunch. Michael Shannon surprisingly does a great job as General Zod, the main villain of the piece. While nobody could match Terence Stamp from the first two films, he does a great job of making Zod both villainous, but also understandable. Amy Adams is really good as Lois Lane. And although they are not in it all that long, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane do a fine job as Jonathan and Martha Kent, the human parents of Superman, who instill their adopted son with a strong moral core. But to me, the highlight of the cast was Russell Crowe as Jor-el, Superman's Kryptonian father. He gives the film a truly iconic screen presence, similar to what Marlon Brando did withSuperman: The Movie. His gravitas gives the film a good emotional jolt, and his scenes are truly memorable. Christopher Meloni, Laurence Fishburne, Harry Lennix and Richard Schiff also turn in great performances.Another fantastic element of the film is Hans Zimmer's remarkable score. While not as memorable as John Williams' classic, it is still a truly remarkable addition to the film, adding additional excitement and emotion to the story. Zimmer is definitely a force to be reckoned with when it comes to film scores, and his work for ""Man of Steel"" is definitely destined to be another classic work of his. In particular, the scene where Clark flies for the first time in the suit is truly exciting and awe-inspiring, even more so with Zimmer's music playing over it. This helped to make that scene the best in the film.Overall, ""Man of Steel"" is a good-but-not-great return for Superman to the big screen. Despite having too much action and spectacle, some strong performances and a great Hans Zimmer score make up for the weaknesses in the story. If you are a fan of Superman and comic book/superhero/action-adventure films, then ""Man of Steel"" is one you're sure to enjoy.Grade: B+",4,"""Man of Steel"" is the Good-but-not-great Return of Superman to the Big Screen",1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,3926,"['absolutely', 'loveSuperman', 'Returns', 'realize', 'now', 'doing', 'way', 'did', 'Staying', 'true', 'feel', '1978', 'Classic', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'modern', 'movie-going', 'audience', 'Now', 'seven', 'years', 'removed', 'previous', 'attempt', 'reignite', 'Superman', 'franchise', 'Producer', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'Director', 'acclaimedThe', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Trilogy', 'Batman', 'Begins', '/', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Rises', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'up', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'S.', 'Goyer', 'Director', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'Watchmen,300', 'reboot', 'Superman', 'saga', 'modern', 'audience', 'overall', 'effort', 'Man', 'Steel', 'delivers', 'promise', 'making', 'Superman', 'accessible', 'modern', 'audience.The', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'where', 'focus', 'was', 'character', 'story', 'expense', 'action', 'spectacle', 'Man', 'Steel', 'exact', 'opposite', 'focusing', 'action', 'spectacle', 'expense', 'character', 'story', 'filmmakers', 'seemed', 'be', 'working', 'hard', 'making', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'version', 'Superman', 'film', 'sadly', 'not', 'entirely', 'work', 'action', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'awesome', 'behold', 'out', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'action', 'sequences', 'result', 'good', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'story', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'decide', 'like', 'actors', 'certain', 'roles', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'Kal-el/Clark', 'Kent/Superman', 'one', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'great', 'what', 'character', 'moments', 'when', 'are', 'thrust', 'action', 'sequence', 'action', 'sequence', 'hard', 'focus', 'squarely', 'characters', 'movie', 'could', 'definitely', 'have', 'used', 'ten', 'minutes', 'action', 'spectacle', 'ten', 'minutes', 'more', 'character', 'story', 'help', 'balance', 'out', 'epic', 'story', 'Nolan', 'Goyer', 'Snyder', 'were', 'attempting', 'tell.Despite', 'flaws', 'movie', 'still', 'out', 'as', 'good', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'action', 'definitely', 'exciting', 'cases', 'anything', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'film', 'are', 'number', 'good', 'performances', 'bunch', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'job', 'General', 'Zod', 'main', 'villain', 'piece', 'nobody', 'could', 'match', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'Zod', 'villainous', 'also', 'understandable', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'really', 'good', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'are', 'not', 'long', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'Jonathan', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'human', 'parents', 'Superman', 'who', 'instill', 'adopted', 'son', 'strong', 'moral', 'core', 'highlight', 'cast', 'was', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Jor-el', 'Superman', 'Kryptonian', 'father', 'film', 'truly', 'iconic', 'screen', 'presence', 'similar', 'what', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'did', 'withSuperman', 'Movie', 'gravitas', 'film', 'good', 'emotional', 'jolt', 'scenes', 'are', 'truly', 'memorable', 'Christopher', 'Meloni', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Harry', 'Lennix', 'Richard', 'Schiff', 'also', 'turn', 'great', 'fantastic', 'element', 'film', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'remarkable', 'score', 'not', 'as', 'memorable', 'John', 'Williams', 'classic', 'still', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'addition', 'film', 'adding', 'additional', 'excitement', 'emotion', 'story', 'Zimmer', 'definitely', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'when', 'film', 'scores', 'work', 'Man', 'Steel', 'definitely', 'destined', 'be', 'classic', 'work', 'particular', 'scene', 'where', 'Clark', 'first', 'time', 'suit', 'truly', 'exciting', 'awe-inspiring', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Zimmer', 'music', 'playing', 'helped', 'make', 'scene', 'best', 'film.Overall', 'Man', 'Steel', 'good-but-not-great', 'return', 'Superman', 'big', 'screen', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'action', 'spectacle', 'strong', 'performances', 'great', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'score', 'make', 'up', 'weaknesses', 'story', 'are', 'fan', 'Superman', 'comic', 'book/superhero/action-adventure', 'films', 'then', 'Man', 'Steel', 'one', ""'re"", 'sure', 'enjoy.Grade', 'B+']",N/A

1562238,AI0BCEWRE04G0,B008JFUPFI,Stoney,"[22, 37]","IN SHORTMAN OF STEEL begins with a well-done 20-minute setup on Krypton, relying heavily on fairly-well-designed stunningly-executed computer graphics, and would probably rate 4 out of 5 on its own.  The remainder of the movie is almost entirely action in excellent, seamless CG, but repetitive and excessive, and utterly lacking in any other essential components of a story, such as plotting and character development, and with problems of internal inconsistency and implausibility.  The resolution is implausible and incomplete.PERSONAL COMMENTLike THE HOBBIT 1, MAN OF STEEL could have been greatly improved by cutting a half-hour of unnecessary, repetitive, gratuitous violence.  I'm a guy, I like action---but it simply went on and on so long, and so repetitively, that it got boring.  It really burns my butt that a superb series like STARGATE UNIVERSE was canceled because the very-limited computer graphics were ""too expensive"".  Five minutes of the CG wasted on MAN OF STEEL (or HOBBIT 1) could have paid for a whole season of SG-U, the whole budget of SG-U, not just the CG.CRITIQUE---from a storyteller's perspective> MAN OF STEEL is unconstrained even by the ""laws"" of physics.  The aliens are utterly invincible and omnipotent.  So the audience is reduced to passive observers of the inexplicable.  That is very poor storytelling.> The best stories are about successes which are achieved with great difficulty by struggling within constraints, of law, of human nature, of expectations, of morality, etc..  Many stories are precisely about stretching or testing those limits.  This is what stories are made of---because these are precisely the challenges we all experience in our ordinary lives.RULES OF THE GAME> In fantasy (or any game or any sport, which are very simplified fantasy worlds), the ""rules"" are essential.  Not merely important, but rather essential.> If the audience knows the rules-of-the-game or constraints-of-the-fantasy-world, they can become involved by anticipating potential problems and they can figure out solutions to the problems.EXAMPLE: When watching football---the main viewer activity is yelling at the quarterback, telling him what play to call, and how to execute it.  Would watching a football game be any fun if three were no rules at all, no ""plays"", if any ""player"" could do anything at any time?EXAMPLE: in ERAGON (the book, not the mediocre movie), doing magic was a great strain on the user, so his/her physical strength had to be conserved and wisely used.  Readers could anticipate when a character might be be tempted to over-extend himself.  Readers could anticipate strategies which could be used do conserve strength.  And as it happened, the character usually did what the reader expected (or feared). That made the reader a participant in the story, and made the novels very satisfying.  Same for Rowling and Tolkien novels and movies.DEUS MACHINA> Even the ancient Greeks had a derisive term (""deus machina"") for poorly crafted stories which ended by a god just showing up and resolving all conflicts and problems by decree (essentially by unconstrained unspecified ""magic"").> The ""resolution"" of the movie (when the Big S smashed head-first through the terraforming machine and ""black hole"" reactor and then snapped the even thicker neck of his equally invincible fellow alien) were pure (and self-contradictory) ""deus machina"" moments.HEROISM?I refuse to call the main character in this movie SUPERMAN---because he isn't the Superman I grew up with.  The Big S is supposed to be a heroic figure--Right?  Heroism is about overcoming ordinary limits (especially of fear and pain) and scraping hard against absolute limits (such as risking death).  If there are no limits, no effort, no challenge, no risk, there is no heroism.  There is nothing heroic about the Big S.AN AMERICAN EMBLEM?Are we suppose to get all mushy over a guy (the big S) who selectively ""saves"" a few random individuals, ignores dozens falling from buildings, and indirectly murders tens of thousands by carelessly destroying occupied vehicles and buildings?  The Big S is just a big dumb brainless thug---""a bull in a china shop"".  The best you can say about him is that he is a thug on our side.  Tragically, is how most of the world thinks about America.  The SUPERMAN of my childhood was an admirable moral man, a strong man, but a man, who tried his best---an appropriate symbol for the America which was once respected.OVERDONE ACTIONViolence is pointless if all the characters are utterly invincible.  A contest of strength is only interesting if there is the possibility and likelihood that one will win and the other will loose.  The Big S and his fellow aliens can be thrown through a dozen buildings without mussing their hair.  Once you are satiated by the shear visual impact of the CG, MAN OF STEEL is about as exciting as watching two babies throw marshmallows at each other.IMPLAUSIBILITIESSuspension of disbelief can go only so far, and MAN OF STEEL was way over-the-top for any intelligent unimpaired individual.> Why do invincible aliens pay the slightest attention to soldiers with mere guns, when missiles have no effect on them?> Why punch a helpless pathetic human when you can toss him (or her) a mile away with a flick of your wrist?> And, these super-aliens happen to carry knifes in case a knife fight with a human is in order?  Really?> What happened to the aliens which were not on the terraforming machine when it was destroyed?  Perhaps they just surrendered, formed a little farming community in Iowa, and applied for green cards ??> While it was reasonable that the original SUPERMAN worked as a shy, self-effacing, mild-mannered newspaper reporter, it is utterly implausible that the bulky negligent egocentric Big S could do so.> Is destroying multi-million dollar aircraft really the best way a guy with god-like powers and technology can conceal his liar from human eyes?  And just what lair is that? Wasn't his spaceship destroyed?  Is the writer/director confusing the Big S with Batman?> A complete list of implausibilities and inconsistencies could go on for pages.  The above are just the ones that particularly triggered my barf reaction.  MAN OF STEEL is a two-rolls-of-duct-tape movie (you wind it around your head to keep it from exploding).GRAPHIC DESIGNThe design of much of the other worldly technology was imaginative---but largely derivative.  That is, most has been done before, much has been done better, and most of the original stuff simply makes no sense.  Are these aliens color blind? or just plain blind??---all their graphic displays are circular very-low-resolution monochrome (apparently in flowing textured metal).  Could you work with such a crappy computer display?  They might be great touch (feel) displays for the visually impaired (blind), but not so great for folks with normal vision; ridiculous for aliens with super-vision.ACTINGMany reviewers complain about the acting.  In my opinion the acting in the few pauses between the endless CG action scenes was mostly maudlin and cliched, but adequate.  The failure of the underlying story to engage the audience was the fault of the directors/editors, not the actors.STARGATE UNIVERSE---recommendationIf you haven't watched SG-U since the series, I very strongly recommend that you try it.  It is MUCH better the second time, and MUCH better as  binges.  The first time you watch SG-U, you don't know the characters, and don't care what happens to them, and so the story kinda drags, but the second time you watch it is an entirely different experience--you become emotionally involved, because you know the characters.  The individual episodes, aired a week apart, were often depressing, because the resolution didn't happen until next week---but in binges of 4 or 5 episodes in an evening you get the crises and the resolutions together.  I'm not an SG fan in the normal since.  (I know no SG trivia, I've never been to an SG website, I know nothing of the actors, and you couldn't drag me to an SG convention).  Yet I've watched the whole series 4 times (in binges 6--9 months apart)---and every time, I have enjoyed it more.  The two complete seasons are about $10 each used, or $15 each new on DVD.SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete First Season,SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete Final Season",1,NOT THE SUPERMAN I

1562239,A26MJME9IBNETY,B008JFUPFI,StrangePegs,"[8, 22]","Back in the summer of 1989, I was walking out of the most ginormous superhero movie ever made. Actually, it was the most ginormous movie release ever, at the time, bringing in $40 million its opening weekend. All of my friends were ecstatic and cheering, and my cousin wouldn't shut up about how the Joker had pulled that three feet long pistol out of his pants and shot down the Batwing, a moment I'd thought was especially stupid, and I wasn't really happy.Yeah, I know. I hear all of you out there being oh so shocked.But, see, the thing I kept thinking, the thing I still think today, was, ""Maybe, if Burton had just been honest and called the movie The Joker, I would have liked it."" [And I could go into a whole thing of all of the things wrong with having Burton make that movie to begin with and how the Joker was the only character he found interesting and how he didn't (and doesn't) like the movie nor, even, the idea of making it--he just wanted to be a part of what he expected to be a vast pop culture phenomenon. But all of that is for some other time.]And that's how I feel about Man of Steel. If Nolan wanted to make a movie about General Zod, he should have just called it General Zod. As it is, I'm left with feelings of dissatisfaction because Superman was only included as what amounts to an afterthought. He's the guy that's going to defeat Zod, and there's only just enough information in the movie to let us know who he is.Which brings me to what I think is the biggest issue with Man of Steel, which includes Nolan's abuse of the title (and let's not fool ourselves into thinking that this was not Nolan's movie, even if Snyder directed it. The story and style was Nolan's, which makes it his). Nolan exploits our outside knowledge of who and what Superman is to skimp on the origin, which he then changes. It's sloppy storytelling. Worse than sloppy. And I don't like feeling exploited. The truth is, if I didn't already know Superman's background, I would have had a difficult time with the movie.For instance, my sister-in-law is a Marvel girl, so she doesn't really know about Superman, not the details, anyway. Her entire exposure to Superman was the godawful Superman Returns, so there were parts of Man of Steel that she didn't get. Like why we should care about Perry White. Within the context of the movie, the fact that we spend so much time watching Perry and friends run away from falling buildings makes no sense. We have no reason to care about that character UNLESS we already know about who he is from the comics (or previous movies or whatever). And she didn't feel any real connection to Clark because the whole reason we care about Clark is we know the Kents took him in and raised him as their own. They accepted him. But what we get from the movie is Jonathan Kent constantly telling Clark what an outsider he is. And don't get me started on the ridiculousness of Jonathan sacrificing himself to the tornado to ""protect"" Clark's secret. All of this includes the lack of context for calling the movie Man of Steel, which does not come from the movie. Unless you know that Superman is called the man of steel, there's no reason to understand the title, so, again, outside knowledge. Also, the name the ""Man of Steel"" was given to Superman when humans thought Superman was actually human. They never think that in the movie, so that particular moniker becomes inappropriate, so, in effect, it's a stupid title for the movie and something only chosen to distinguish it from the other Superman movies. He should have just gone with Superman or, even better, General Zod.So, with all of that in mind, no, I did not like the middle of the movie. I thought the origin part of the origin story of Superman was very poorly handled. We have no idea of who this new guy is, no idea of the strength of his character, no idea of why we should trust him. Other than, well, he says we should, and that after trashing Metropolis (at least, I suppose it's Metropolis--the movie wasn't explicit with that). What we do know is that, when he was a kid, he saved a busload of kids and got in trouble for it. Later, after having a fight with his dad, he allowed his dad to be killed by a tornado.Also, the idea of Clark having spent 15 years as a drifter while looking for his origins is... well, it's dumb. Why didn't he ever stick that key into the spaceship in the barn? The technology should have been exactly the same. Or is it that the spaceship was ""broken""? I'm just not buying that explanation. And why would he even expect to find anything else on Earth from wherever it was he was from? There's no good logic for any of that. It's just a contrived way to bring Lois into contact with Clark and not a very good one at that. And I have nothing to say about the ""symbolism"" of having Clark be 33 when Zod comes to Earth. That, also, was just dumb. As was Clark learning to fly, basically, because daddy left him a super suit. For which, by the way, there is no good reason for it to have been on a spaceship buried under arctic ice for 20,000 years.The beginning of the movie, though, I liked. Mostly. It was good to have a back story for Zod beyond ""space criminal."" The swimming scene and the codex being a skull, though, was, again, dumb. As was depositing the codex within the body of baby Kal-El. The rest was pretty cool, even if it was rather like watching Star Wars what with the big battleships while Jor-El flew around on some kind of giant insect. Yes, I'm overlooking the part where, basically, the entire population of Krypton chooses to stay on Krypton and die rather than evacuate despite having the technology to do so. [I'm also overlooking the fact that, evidently, every single Kryptonian colony failed despite having huge world engine terraforming machines.]So... we open the move with Zod, and we end the movie with Zod. It was a movie about Zod. And the end of the movie just went on and on and the destruction was beyond my ability to accept. See, here's the thing, we, as viewers, accept that Superman is a good guy, because, well, we know he's a good guy. We have 75 years of prior knowledge that tells us he's a good guy. But the people of Earth in the movie have no such prior knowledge. They don't know who Superman is any more than they know who Zod is. What they do know is that two aliens showed up and destroyed a major city and tried to destroy the world. But, yet, they just accept that Superman is a ""good guy,"" and Nolan gets away with it because he bases that on our knowledge of the character, not what's revealed of the character in the movie (who, remember, allowed his human father to die because of an argument).But how was Zod? So much of the focus is on him, so how was he? Michael Shannon was, actually, very excellent as Zod. If you've seen him in Boardwalk Empire, it's apparent why he was chose, and it was a good call. He brings just the right amount of zeal to the role to make it believable.Russel Crowe, whom I generally dislike, was pretty good in his role as Jor-El. Well, except for the hide-and-seek bit in the spaceship, but that was hardly his fault. Seriously? The virtual Jor-El is going to play hide-and-seek with his son upon being uploaded? Another bit of contrivance to get Clark out of the way so that Lois could injured. [And, um, just why didn't Clark hear her coming down  the tunnel? It's not like she was being quiet. Or that that should have mattered at all.]Henry Cavill was adequate as Superman, although I think he really got the part due to his resemblance to Tom Welling from Smallville. They have the same ""farm-boyish"" grin. I liked Costner as Jonathan, even if I didn't like the part, much, as it was written. I don't have, however, have strong positive feelings for Diane Lane as Martha. I also thought Amy Adams was good in her role. The rest were non-spectacular.The final result is that I have a lot of mixed feelings about this newest Superman, which is a far cry better than how I felt about the last Superman. This new one is just too much Nolan for me, who seems to be more concerned on an ongoing basis with what seems cool rather than what makes a good story. Seriously, I didn't need more of the Inception-type building collapses. I am interested to see where Nolan is going to take the story, unless this just ends up being a setup for the JLA movie that DC and Warner Brothers are still trying to get off the ground, at which point, I will decide that DC needs to scrap all the previous movie history it's developed and start over, just like they keep doing with their comic book world. Maybe, someday, they'll get it right.",3,Bait and Switch,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,8647,"['Back', 'summer', '1989', 'was', 'walking', 'most', 'ginormous', 'superhero', 'movie', 'ever', 'made',

1562243,A3T66CI257EYWX,B008JFUPFI,superman fan,"[3, 11]","Superman is considered the first and the greatest Super hero ever created. The Man of Steel is a horrible movie and is nothing like the comic character we all know and love. At the begging when Russell Crowe was flying around on a dragon it was so stupid. Come on this is a superman movie, not some stupid harry potter avatar fantasy crap. The planet krypton in this movie was awful and looked like red planet from a star wars movie. What happened to the beautiful place with crystals? The Kryptonian council looked incredibly stupid wearing gold and looking like Egyptian pharaohs instead of the traditional white robes with their family crest on them. If there were spaceships and dragons only in this new version on Krypton, why didn't the kryptonians just fly away on there ships when the planet started to rumble and explode? They should have also never had zod stab and kill jor-el at the beginning, it changed the greatness of seeing Jorel and Lara together as the only survivor of krypton took off in the sky in his rocket. In the movie they then skipped the whole story of Kal-el landing on earth and the Kent's finding him in a field. This film has tons of flash backs when he was a kid that are really short and you don't get that much information, they were ok, but since there were so much of them it drives you a little crazy. They should have done some sequences in order. The Kent parents did not really show at all any love an compassion like they were meant to do. I hated how instead of having the dramatic sad event when Johnathan has a heart attack, they had him disappear in the twister because he didn't want Clark to save him and expose himself in front of the other people. Come on Clark exposed his secret 1 or 2 times before that. Anyone who had the ability would reveal there powers in order to save their father. Having Lois find out that this person with powers is Clark Kent even before he was superman ruined the whole movie. This is not how it should have been done. During the scene when a hologram Jor-el kept popping up and opening and closing doors on the spaceship was totally lame. I thought that the kryptonian suites were ridiculously stupid and they looked like mini transformers.As he became superman the character wasn't special, and he didn't portray who superman really is. The Last hour of the movie was really terrible and full of a bunch of crazy s***! Boom boom! Fighting, and they totally wrecked the whole city. For a long time they are standing and fighting in front of a Sear's building, and it just seems like we got nothing going here let's advertise Sear's so we can get some customers to our stores. In this film it is all dark and gloomy like they were trying to make a dark knight movie which was a total disaster. Pretty much everyone except his parents hated him whether he was Clark Kent or Superman. Even Lois lane didn't like him as either Clark or as superman. She and Supes had a big lame kiss at the end that didn't really fit because she shows no liking of him. The Lois lane in the comics and movies goes crazy over superman and is madly attracted but not in this one Oh did I mention they only called him Superman once or twice!I found the new suite to be okay but I didn't love it. If you compare the suite with the ones in the Spider man movies, it is the same thing with the colors and scaly fabric, take off the spider and put on an S. I am not hung up on the original superman movies and do think that some parts are boring, but the first two were good examples of what superman stands for. What they should have done with the Man of Steel was recreated the original superman movie up to the point were he becomes superman and than created what ever movie they wanted but no crap. They could have even still used the same suit and the same actors but actually made a wonderful memorable movie like they did a long time for the older generation. What can you expect about the movie is that this is not the beloved superman we have always known, the story is mostly completely told backwards and there is no kryptonite, fortress of solitude, lex luthor, and jimmy olsen. There is also is no love, passion, and or some one to look up too. Finally this is just not a good movie. Man of steel is essentially so jam-packed and busy that it's an origin story, a coming-of-age story, a science fiction film, a superhero movie, an alien invasion, a war movie, and a disaster movie all bumping into each other. This is a really messed up superhero movie using the superman characters, but this is not Superman we have known for 75 years. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster the creators of superman have watched this movie from heaven and are completely ashamed of what has become of their 75 year old superhero that they had created.",1,Superman 75th anniversary ruined!!,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,4793,"['Superman', 'considered', 'first', 'greatest', 'Super', 'hero', 'ever', 'created', 'Man', 'Steel', 'horrible',

I had trouble seeing how his story can make a comeback.  Marvel was taking all the fame and glory with ""Iron Man"", ""Hulk"", ""Thor"", ""Captain America"", and ultimately, ""The Avengers"".  Not to mention that the ""Dark Knight Trilogy"" had taken Batman's story to a whole new level.  I was worried that there was no room left or even a but least of chance for Man of Steel hero.  I really did, at first, believe that ""Man of Steel"" was going to fail.But then I saw the movie in theaters and I was completely corrected by the amazingness of ""Man of Steel!  I was surprised that I actually started loving this movie when it first began!  The story, the acting, and the suspense had me looking on to see what happens next!  For once in my life, I was shocked and excited for this movie.When I found out that the legendary, ""Christopher Nolan"" had written the story for the film, I was freaking out of my mind!  I knew that I recognized the beautiful development of the world and of the storyline as well.  Christopher Nolan was (and still is) my inspiration.  Since his work on the ""Dark Knight Trilogy"", I have used him as an inspiration.  And then we even have Zach Synder directing the movie too.  I love his work on ""300"" and ""Legend of the Guardians""!We also have great actors who helped bring their characters to life.  Like Henry Cavill, who did an amazing job at portraying Superman and actually making us feel for him.  A man who is trying to discover who he is and where his place is in this world, while trying to stay hidden from a world that fears him.  Amy Adams's Lois Lane was one of the greatest acting characters I have ever seen!  She completely allowed us to see a ""real"" Lois inside of her and also bring out something new as well.  And we also have the legendary Russell Crowe, who finally brings us a ""badass"" Jor-El.  Russell allows us to see Mr. El in action and also allows us to actually like him and bring out a whole new personality of him too.  But then we have the villain, Zod!  Michael Shannon brings out his ""soldier"" acting and transforms it into something amazing with one of the greatest foes that Superman has ever faced!  We see his evilness and also his will to do what is necessary for the greater good.  He is what a good soldier really is about and Michael brings it to life for the first time.  Both Martha and Jonathan Kent are played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, who make everything about them from the comics come to life and show us how they really would be in a movie like this.  And finally, we have Laurence Fishburne, who gives us perhaps the greatest acting as Perry White since the original Superman films.  Not only do we see a familiar Perry White, but we also get to see a little bit of ""Morpheus"" inside his character.  Trust me when I say it, the acting is just amazing from every single actor and the people who chose them did very good!The storyline of this movie was beautiful and it was so Christopher Nolan-style!  Everything was great in depth of every character, including moments as well.  Despite the lack of character-development, the story of this movie was amazing and it brought back Superman from the grave!

While the first Superman movie with Christopher Reeve was fun, iconic and kept with the true spirit of the Simon and Schuster comic book classic, it was a bit on the light side and a bit too humorous. When it was announced that Zack Synder was directing this new interpretation of the Son from Krypton, my expectations were unexpectedly high. Both Watchmen and 300 were brilliant comic book based movies. Unfortunately, Man of Steel, was not.Despite having some very interesting and creative scenes of Krypton with Russell Crowe and some very touching scenes with Kevin Costner and young Clark Kent, there was a definite disconnect with the plot due to large gaps in sequencing. The movie felt choppy and uneven in trying to teeter back and forth between present day and past scenes of Clark Kent.  It seemed Synder was more concerned about creating atmosphere instead of adequately telling a story. Worst of all, there were absolute lapses of logic. The first meeting and subsequent meetings between Clark and Lois Lane felt hallow, unconvincing and most of all, lacking of any chemistry whatsoever. You felt absolutely nothing between this new take of Superman and Lois while in contrast, the 1978 version of Clark and Lois felt genuine and magical. In the final battle between Zod and Superman, Superman tosses Zod through building after building, causing 9-11 level destruction as buildings collapse in the middle of Metropolis, resulting in thousands of innocent deaths, and yet, all he cares about is saving Lois? And in the end of the movie, people are supposed to honor and respect as a hero after all the death and destruction his presence has caused??? One pivotal scene at the end of the movie (without revealing a spoiler) is so uncharacteristic of Superman, that it's literally inexcusable and unforgivable for us that grew up reading Superman.  By emulating Christopher Nolan in reworking the superhero mythos, Synder has given us a sad, moody and emo Superman. While this may work for Batman, that's not Superman. For that reason, this movie fails to revitalize the myth to modern sensibilities. It lacks the charm, the chemistry and the solid storytelling that the 1978 original brought.",2,Disjointed and disappointing,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,2354,"['When', 'previews', 'new', 'Superman', 'movie', 'made', 'rounds', 'internet', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'new', 'modern', 'more', 'serious', 'take', 'Man', 'Steel', 'first', 'Superman', 'movie', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'was', 'fun', 'iconic', 'kept', 'true', 'spirit', 'Simon', 'Schuster', 'comic', 'book', 'classic', 'was', 'bit', 'light', 'side', 'bit', 'too', 'humorous', 'When', 'was', 'announced', 'Zack', 'Synder', 'was', 'directing', 'new', 'interpretation', 'Son', 'Krypton', 'expectations', 'were', 'unexpectedly', 'high', 'Watchmen', '300', 'were', 'brilliant', 'comic', 'book', 'based', 'movies', 'Unfortunately', 'Man', 'Steel', 'was', 'not.Despite', 'having', 'very', 'interesting', 'creative', 'scenes', 'Krypton', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'very', 'touching', 'scenes', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'was', 'definite', 'disconnect', 'plot', 'due', 'large', 'gaps', 'sequencing', 'movie', 'felt', 'choppy', 'uneven', 'trying', 'teeter', 'back', 'forth', 'present', 'day', 'past', 'scenes', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'seemed', 'Synder', 'was', 'more', 'concerned', 'creating', 'atmosphere', 'instead', 'adequately', 'telling', 'story', 'Worst', 'were', 'absolute', 'lapses', 'logic', 'first', 'meeting', 'subsequent', 'meetings', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'felt', 'hallow', 'unconvincing', 'most', 'lacking', 'chemistry', 'whatsoever', 'felt', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'new', 'take', 'Superman', 'Lois', 'contrast', '1978', 'version', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'felt', 'genuine', 'magical', 'final', 'battle', 'Zod', 'Superman', 'Superman', 'Zod', 'building', 'building', 'causing', '9-11', 'level', 'destruction', 'buildings', 'collapse', 'middle', 'Metropolis', 'resulting', 'thousands', 'innocent', 'deaths', 'yet', 'saving', 'Lois', 'end', 'movie', 'people', 'are', 'supposed', 'honor', 'respect', 'hero', 'death', 'destruction', 'presence', 'caused', 'One', 'pivotal', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'revealing', 'spoiler', 'so', 'uncharacteristic', 'Superman', 'literally', 'inexcusable', 'unforgivable', 'grew', 'up', 'reading', 'Superman', 'emulating', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'reworking', 'superhero', 'mythos', 'Synder', 'given', 'sad', 'moody', 'emo', 'Superman', 'may', 'work', 'Batman', 'not', 'Superman', 'reason', 'movie', 'revitalize', 'myth', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'charm', 'chemistry', 'solid', 'storytelling', '1978', 'original', 'brought']",N/A

I couldn't wait to see that universe unfold. I went opening day with my comic loving friends. As we watched all 3 of us couldn't believe what we were seeing. Horrible wooden dialogue and acting, a plot that seemed too rushed at times and then would speed up at other times, constant flashbacks, uncomfortable awkwardness, and digital effects that seemed out of date and not as seamless as other films in the genre.

Are those the words that should come to mind when someone thinks ""Superman""?Probably the biggest problem here is Superman's motivation. Here we have a Superman motivated by childhood trauma. Where in all other incarnations, Superman is motivated by a sense of personal responsibility and his own goodness, instilled in him by both his earthly and other-earthly fathers. Having a Superman motivated by personal confusion, fear, and pain just doesn't work.There's no joy in this movie. No love. Everyone in it is so serious at all times, if anyone dares crack a smile, it seems forced and out of place.The father relationships in this movie are off, big time. The Kryptonian father has nothing to do with his son at all. Only pops up in the middle to answer a question or two, that's it. His earthly father spends all his time obsessing over making Clark feel so worried about his own powers that he shouldn't DARE use them to help humanity. The whole thing is just weird!People in this movie don't act the way real people would. When little Clark saves his classmates, instead of their parents saying ""thanks""! and thanking God for the miracle, they just get all spooked and serious. (Oh that's right I forgot, because in this movie anytime something interesting happens, it's time to double down on the seriousness...) Give me a break.Another big problem in this movie is there is no chemistry between the leads. When Supes is in prison and Lois Lane is interviewing, they both start getting all smiley and making googly eyes at each other. I'm sorry, but this just does not work. It seems forced and phony. It's there just because the plot dictates that the two are supposed to be together. But the problem is, this idea works against the character of the new Superman they created. By changing the backstory, they've made a Superman who has no business caring about or loving anyone. This is a Superman who is so self-absorbed, so wrapped up in his own childhood trauma, that he couldn't possibly step out of that for a few seconds and smile.I hated the muddled plot in this movie. It made no sense whatsoever. Kryptonian genetics? An argument over eugenics? What is all this nonsense? The core problem of Krypton is its imminent destruction - not stem cell research!No natural births on Krypton... Oh-kay. And Superman is the only one in years. Why? Because his body holds ""the codex"" that's supposed to... I don't know. Allow him to repopulate a new Krypton later after he assembles a harem of 1,000 willing females? The whole thing is just goofy.(And speaking of the ""Codex"", is that kind of like the ""All Spark""? Are we watching a Transformers movie here or what?)Everything about this new Superman was bizarre and wrong. Ironic, since he has an enemy in the comics called ""Bizarro"". I guess if they made a Bizarro version of the Superman in this movie it would be a Superman we could actually like.It is strange to think that I can look back on ""Superman Returns"" and say with no hesitation that that was a far better movie than this one. That movie wasn't perfect or even great by any means. But it had heart. At least that Superman cared about others. When Bryan Singer made that movie, he didn't get so wrapped up in the special effects that he forgot to give it a soul.For me, the biggest indightment against ""Man of Steel"" it is that it is NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY. Grim and grisly are not words that should come to mind when I think of Superman. Yet here we have young Clark terrified as he sees the skulls of his teacher and classmates. An older one letting his father DIE because... well, who knows really? To add to the drama, I suppose. And we see a Superman sinking into a field of skulls. How to explain THAT one to your kids?I hated this movie. It disgusted me. It had awesome special effects, sure. But it had no heart and soul. It was a Superman Parody, a generic product for the masses driven by egotism and greed.

I was in favor of a continuation, and I thought ""Superman Returns"" was pretty well done, although it had an odd plot.  I wanted to find a reason to not like ""Man of Steel""; after growing up with ""Superman"" and later watching/enduring 10 seasons of ""Smallville"", I thought the last thing the public needed was another retelling of the origin of Superman.  I am a big fan of the original Superman movie and the spirit behind ""Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut"".  I did not think a reboot could capture the spirit and good feeling of the original.  ""Man of Steel"" turned out to be a movie I thoroughly enjoyed and even came back to see it again.  I don't mind at all if my initial presumptions are proven wrong and I have to eat my own words - ""Man of Steel"" exceeded expectations and was an awesome movie.  The story on Krypton was ok, but when the movie really gets moving it does not let up.I was initially skeptical of Michael Shannon playing General Zod, especially given his eccentric role on ""Boardwalk Empire"", but he did fine.  The pleasant surprise is the character of Faora, General Zod's second in command, played by basically unknown actress Antje Traue.  She has these beautiful, yet predatory eyes, and stands out in the movie. There are some actually unique aspects of a story told many times, like with the Kryptonians having a hard time adjusting to the Earth's atmosphere.  The cheesiness of Superman past is diminished, and he is often known as just ""Clark"", ""Kal-El"" or ""Kal"".  The story of his growing up in Smallville is smartly told in flashbacks to get right to Clark/Kal as a man.  Amy Adams does a nice job as Lois Lane as does Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, Kevin Coster as Jonathan Kent, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, and Russell Crowe as Jor-El.  Henry Cavill does an excellent job in the title role; his face conveys a lot of emotion, he is absolutely ripped, and probably looks the closest to the comic book version of any actor yet.  The franchise follows in a solid foundation that Christopher Nolan established with the newer Batman movies.  Like ""The Dark Knight"" series, the movie has a good story and has the best interest of the franchise in mind vice following a basic formula to try and just make a blockbuster movie.  ""Man of Steel"" is a homerun; it does not take away from the original ""Superman"", but compliments it as a different, modernized version.  The special and visual effects are amazing as you would expect.

1562280,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B008JFUPFI,The People's Critic,"[5, 12]","""Yes, it's Superman, strange visitor from another planet, who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel in his bare hands, and who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way..."" But what lead to all of this? That's the question director, Zack Snyder attempts to answer in the latest treatment of ""the last son of Krypton,"" Man of Steel.It has been 75 years since Superman first appeared in 1938's Action Comics' premier issue. Since then, the character has starred in countless comics, TV shows, and movies. Yet, with Man of Steel, Superman's sixth cinematic appearance, most of the buzz revolved around Christopher Nolan's involvement with the project. Nolan, most known as the director of the remarkable Dark Knight trilogy, teamed up with his Dark Knight series co-writer, David S. Goyer to write the screenplay for Man of Steel. Nolan and Goyer successfully revitalized the Batman franchise by making it edgy, making it smart, and taking a fresh take on a familiar story. Thus, the hopes are that they were able to do the same to DC Comic's most popular hero, Superman. Man of Steel, unfortunately, does not quite deliver the goods.The film opens on Krypton as the doomed planet is self-destructing after its inhabitants have mined the nutrients of its core, causing a full on apocalypse. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Laura decide to place their newborn son, Kal-El in a capsule headed for Earth in the hopes that he will know a better life and continue a form of the Kryptonian line of people. Kal-El is, of course discovered and raised by Kansas farmers, The Kents where he is famously renamed ""Clark."" Conflict arrives when Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon) arrives on Earth searching for Kal-El as part of his mission to obliterate man-kind in a genocidal plot to repopulate Earth with pure Kryptonians.Man of Steel sets out to offer a different tone than is usually found in a Superman film. Henry Cavill's performance as the title character is far more serious, insightful, and raw than any previous Superman. Additionally, this is the most violent Superman film to date, proliferated with tragedy and destruction. Director, Snyder does offer a fresh take on the well-known origin story with a non-linear timeline that bounces back and forth through Superman's first 33 years on Earth. He also, gives audiences a lengthier glimpse at Krypton than found in previous films. The non-traditional timeline works very well, preventing the film from hitting snags as the character grows. Instead, audiences are able to see Superman earlier with a peppering of flashbacks to add context to his story. With all of this being said, the film lacks the edge and intelligence necessary to allow it to, well, soar. The opening sequence on Krypton is a welcomed change, but the planet is already experiencing so much unrest that it is hard to believe these alien people are anything but flawed and miserable. In fact, this scene introduces a sort of Brave New World motif where choice has been bred out of Krypton, and society chooses the fate of all inhabitants. The screenplay opts for simplicity over complexity, which forces the film into a brainless extended action scene for the final hour; a scene that puts the ""never-ending"" in the ""never-ending battle for truth, justice, and the American way."" Coupled with these extended action scenes is Snyder's shooting technique. He uses a lot of shaky, hand-held camera shots, which do become strenuous at times.Perhaps the most major missed opportunity is the weak exploration of young Kal-El's/Clark Kent's struggles as an alien in a strange world. While Snyder does explore this, he does so in a fashion that merely glosses over the surface. Scene's involving Superman's youth are far too underdeveloped and border on stereotypical. Furthermore, the fun and the romance that are expected from a Superman story are in short supply in Man of Steel. Instead, this reboot attempts to ground a movie about alien superpeople living and battling on Earth in some sort of reality, which is a bit preposterous.The casting is certainly the film's major strength. Cavill is, of course, an excellent choice for Superman. He looks the part and has great presence on the screen. Amy Adams gives a performance as Lois Lane that veers far from her just being a silly girl getting into trouble all of the time, and Michael Shannon gives another full-tilt-crazy performance as Zod. Other familiar minor characters are also well cast including Laurance Fishburne as Perry White and Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Ma and Pa Kent.All together, Man of Steel shows promise, but mostly for what is yet to come. Warner Brothers has already green-lit a sequel that will be fast-tracked to release before 2015's Justice League. Man of Steel feels like a bloated set-up piece to what promises to be a far more superior sequel. B-Man of Steel is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 2 hours and 28 minutes. The film was post-converted to 3-D, however there are some exciting sequences that are enhanced by the conversion. Nonetheless, 2-D is recommended and there is no stinger after the credits, so feel free to go home if you're not interested in who the 2nd assistant sound editor was.",3,"Good, but You've Seen it all

The action was incredible, the special effects were pristine, and the music was great. I really enjoyed the way this movie had more of a science fiction feel to it compared to the Christopher Reeves / Brandon Routh movies.But there were a couple of things that really bothered me about this movie, and no, neither of them were the end of the Zod / Superman fight (Possible spoiler alerts):1. I didn't like the way they handled Jonathan Kent's death. Seriously? He can't get away from the tornado and he holds up his hand to stop his son from saving him? I understand that he wanted to protect his son from the world, but the writers couldn't find a better way to do it?2. In this movie, Superman's arch nemesis Zod is fought and beaten, a giant terraforming device attempts to destroy life on Earth, and half of Metropolis is destroyed from the final battle. Where are the movies supposed to go from here? How can they evolve after a movie like this? Sequels are always built to be bigger and better, but I have no idea how they can ever go bigger.So in the end, this movie is fun to watch, but there was far too much thrown in it. I honestly feel that the reason Man of Steel 2 is now Batman vs. Superman is because the writers have no idea how to write a stand-a-lone story that can be bigger.

That film managed to push all the right buttons to satisfy any film fan. Man of Steel's initial look at an adult Clark Kent casts him not as the mild mannered reporter in glasses but more as The Fugitive.

1562287,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B008JFUPFI,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[6, 14]","First off when dealing with such an iconic character a director has no chance at making everyone happy...stay too true to the source material (especially when it's been done before) and the director has simply made another unnecessary reboot; stray too far from the material or change things radically and the director is a hack, a savage who doesn't understand the character or what he's doing.  In many ways Snyder, with hopes riding so high, was a damned man the moment he sat in the director's seat.  Some fans will drool and many more will say, ""Not cool.""My wife and I, people who enjoy action/ fantasy movies (and superhero movies in particular), were somewhere in the middle.  The trailer for this feature film got us excited and the movie delivered overall, it was enjoyable and had action spread throughout (mind you not all of the action was the beat-'em-up type).  We would easily recommend it for a variety of reasons.Perhaps first and foremost, for me at least, is that this movie portrays ideas that the characters live out; in many ways it's about metaphysics and philosophy, beliefs and attachments that come to define a person.  The movie doesn't shy away from embracing this either.  Superman the icon in this film is an embodiment of a man's ability to choose who he will be and how he will define himself over and above a deterministic, naturalistic path of evolution; he is the man who is able to value integrity, goodness, and be a respector of life as inherently valuable (something we are fast losing in our culture--and something that causes him emotional anguish when he is forced to take life to save life); he is the man who can rise above it all, take a leap of faith, because he can see and has been taught that there is a spark of divinity in all of us.  It comes as no surprise that Superman is regarded as savior and in one scene he is in a church talking to a priest with two stained-glass windows behind him, one depicting Jesus Christ sacrificing himself and another showing Jesus as the good shepherd caring for his sheep; and in another scene he adopts the iconic arms outstretched pose of the cricified savior of mankind.  All of this is very deliberate and so is the drawing links of these beliefs to what has been considered distinctly American ideology in past decades.  Supes also wrestles with his interpersonal connections; he is a man of two worlds, but he is encouraged to embrace the best wisdom of both.  He receives and values guidance both from his heavenly...er, Kryptonian father as well as his earthly father.  He yearns for connection, and he's given the chance to be connected to the human race but is also given the opportunity to reconnect and align himself with his Kryptonian heritage; but he has to make a bitter choice (the film doesn't really dwell on this though) as to whom he will ultimately align with and he makes his decision based on belief, on ideology...some might even say on love (but not of an erotic or romantic sort).This film invites discussion and even reflection.  It's more than standard superhero fare for those who have ears to hear.  But many people will miss this and they will see it more than hear it.  The film isn't a visual powerhouse though it is visually stimulating.  It actually goes more for an emotional tone visually; one of nostalgic memory, lingering and longing and at other times resolution, strength, and power.  The tone is about what has happened before and how that is affecting Superman's ""now"".  Visually the film is slightly and intentionally grainy, or filtered to increase shadow.  One thing that I didn't like about the film is that it could have used a lot more steadicam.  Sometimes I want to see my money shots crisply and clearly, not as if I'm standing near ground zero with my vision having to adjust to all of the shaking movement.  The fight scenes aren't really anything sci-fi and fantasy fans haven't seen before and, this is important, the real reason that they work is because they are usually given the emotional weight of Supes caring about the outcomes of the fight, and the participants of the fight.  But there are some things that we thought didn't work that well.Amy Adams as Lois Lane.  No.  Nothing against her, she's a fine actress, but Lane simply needs to be a strong-willed, raven-haired woman with not just feisty determination as portrayed by Adams but someone with more grit and sass.  And there was virtually no chemistry between her and Cavill!  Personally I also had problems with Michael Shannon.  There was something about him that just, for me at least, didn't seem to be able to carry or convey the weight of this brutal and determined Kryptonian.  Shannon seemed like he was trying to play General Zod in an imperialist fashion but it just didn't quite convincingly carry.  Many of the other secondary characters were also a bit flat.Countering this, though, is Henry Cavill.  Great, great job.  Great bit of casting.  He nailed it.  We didn't get to see him as the Clark Kent of the Daily Planet (except for a snippet) so we didn't get to see him trying on a nebbishy affect; I don't know how he'll do with that and we shall see in the sequel.  But as the young man finding his way, as the young man quietly taking in the sun's rays and recalling his fathers' talks, as Superman in tights and cape, he nailed it.  He possessed a strong, assured, and determined presence that still managed to exude concern and humility.  Did I say great job, Henry Cavill?  Yes?  Well, I mean it.  Major reason to see the movie.Russell Crowe as Jor-El, Kal-El's Kryptonian father, also gave an understated but clear performance that felt like it was spot on.But in summing up (watch out for that Lex-Corp truck Superman!) director Zak Snyder gives audiences a Superman origin story that is fleshed out with a sense of history, introduces a variety of important characters within the Superman mythology, and (most importantly) presents us with a Superman we can and will care about in a story that slowly builds its excitement but develops plenty of heart and throws at us some important thoughts.Oh, and isn't it refreshing that we don't have any Lex Luthor or kryptonite to throw at Superman in this film?

1562288,A3BP3B77JU68KZ,B008JFUPFI,Thursday's Child,"[12, 26]","This is the third revamping of the General Zod storyline. Superman, Smallville and now this. Alex Ross redefined Superman in the comic books and Henry Cavill is obviously designed to fit the image. The problem is that none of the characters are particularly likable. Perry White (Lawrence Fishburne) is now black. Well, I guess that's okay because now the green Lantern of Earth 2, Alan Scott, has come out as being gay in the comics. (Please DC, don't make Robin a victim of child molestation by Bruce Wayne just to be politically correct and honor the memory of Dr. Frederick Wertham, who said as much decades ago in his book, Seduction of the Innocent). All of the performances in Man of Steel seem soulless and wooden. CGI ridden, writing deficient, I felt like I was watching Transformers II. I did not care much for Zod either. Callum Blue was far, far better.The General Zod storyline didn't really emerge as anyone of significance in the Superman arc until 39 years after the legend began with the first Superman movie, which appears somewhat cheesy today, but there's no excaping the fact that Christopher Reeve made Clark Kent human. Warner Brothers then went and took the evil Zod and turned him into Jor-El when ""Smallville"" was made with Terrance Stamp playing both characters. Lest we not forget that ""Smallville"" also had Clark's girlfriend become Clark's earth mother and his cousin, Kara become his Kryptonian birth mother, leaving one wonder whether Smallville is really somewhere in Kentucky. The fact of the matter is that Zod is not that interesting a character, and why are we made to suffer through a rehash of a storyline that we know the outcome of? At least, Callum Blue added dimension of Zod's character. Henry Cavill's Zod is just angry all the time.Before DC writers went insane, science on Krypton wasn't that advanced. Krypton didn't have any space travel and the rocket in which baby Kal-El was sent to earth was a prototype. Krypton exploded, because of uranium core that fissioned and Jor-El was a respected scientist, as was Zor-El, his brother. Krypton wasn't in some other galaxy. It was in the Milky Way, and when it exploded, two parts of it had survived: Argo City, which came off as a huge chunk, which continued to revolve around Krypton's sun, and Kandor, which had been stolen, people and all, by Brainiac, who turned out to be a robot, who went around collecting cities from various planets and displaying them in bottles. After Krypton blew up, every bit of ground in Argo City turned to kryptonite, which shouldn't have affected non super Kryptonians, but for some reason it did. Fortunately, apparently, there was a sheet lead factory on the outskirts and Zor-El was able to direct the survivors to roll out tons of it to cover every bit of land, as others  worked furiously to make use of the plastic from the plastic factory to create a huge bubble to hold in the atmosphere. Rockets were later installed underneath the planet fragment (from the steel factory) and with fuel from the jet fuel refinery, propel Argo City to our solar system, which all of the Argonauts gained superpowers. Zor-El, idiot leader, decided this was bad, so back they rocketed to Kryptonian space until around fifteen years later, there is a meteor storm that smashes the dome and using the only other rocket prototype, Zor-El is able to send his only daughter, Kara, to earth, where she becomes ""Superman's Secret Weapon"". As the only other survivor from a dead planet, Supes should have mated with her to renew the Kryptonian race. Forgetting the fact that she was only 15, it was the Kentuckian thing to do. But, he had this thing going for the idiotic earth woman who drove him nuts trying endlessly to destroy the one thing that gave him some measure of peace, his secret identity. Let's not even try and figure how a man with superpowers can have sex with an ordinary person or how his super-sperm didn't blast right through her. On the Tonight Show, Johnny Carson asked Margot Kidder how this was made possible. Kidder, kidding, said that Lois Lane used a kryptonite coil. Or maybe it was the fact that Zor-El and his wife escaped at the last minute into the Safety Zone, a Phantom Zone-type dimension that Zor-El had invented. (several questions: why didn't Jor-El save all of Krypton by projecting them into the Phantom Zone or at least his own family? Or why didn't Zor-El do the same with the Safety Zone. And when Argo City blew off, how was it that there was enough gravity to hold everything and everyone to the planetary chunk? Well, all this took place long before we were all savvy to such things and knew how yellow sun radiation can cause Kryptonians, apparently all built from transuranium elements, to gain superpowers.The point being that Brainiac was a far more interesting adversary than Zod, as was Metallo, a criminal, given a robot body with a uranium-powered heart that he eventually switches out for kryptonite (hmmm, did Stan Lee steal this concept for Iron Man and a later steal for Robocop?) or the Parasite, a man who gained superhuman strength by absorbing life energy from anyone he came in contact with, including Superman. The Parasite would have been an even greater concept as to why he turned bad, since, like Rogue in X-Men, he could never have a relationship, since his condition would kill anyone who comes near.There was a great episode of the Adventures of Superman with George Reeves that would have done far better than the storyline here. Season 2, Episode 12: Panic in the Sky, December 5, 1953  ""Superman rams a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth. The impact causes the asteroid to now orbit the planet. However, Superman is staggered as he returns to Earth. He manages to change back to Clark Kent (apparently a reflex action) but doesn't remember who he is. Meanwhile, the orbiting asteroid still presents hazards for Earth. Only Superman can place an explosive device that will demolish the asteroid -- and no one, including Clark, knows where Superman is."" No villains. No CGI every minute. This was a story about a man who subconsciously just wanted to be like everyone else and had to come to the realization that his own personal life was less important that that of the rest of the world. This was sort of the theme of Superman II. In fact, the best part of all of the Christopher Reeve movies was where Lois Lane dies and, despite Jor-el's warning, Superman turns back time to save her.So why Zod all the time? And, by the way, in the comic books, Clark would have given out a high-pitched super shriek to cause everyone in the crowd to wince and grab their ears, as he rescued his father. Not let him die.Man of Steel simply lacks heart, but then I see David S. Goyer as more of a rewriter than a screenwriter. I guess, though, if you have enough money to spend as does Warner Bros., you can bag rocks and label them diamonds. Man of Steel was as much of a disappointment to me as was Prometheus, which was replete with gaping plot holes and riddled with screen written stupidity. But I can't wait to see Ben Affleck as Batman (I say that with extreme sarcasm) in the comic book heroes first filmatic get together (first united in World Finest Comics in 1954).",2,I Feel

1562289,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B008JFUPFI,Tim Janson,"[0, 4]","So apparently there is some controversy over the Man of Steel and Superman killing General Zod&#8230;But what a minute!  Didn&#8217;t Superman kill Zod way back in 1980&#8217;s Superman II?  Superman uses the molecule chamber to take Zod&#8217;s powers away, essentially turning him human.  He crushes his hand into mush, picks him up then tosses him into a seemingly bottomless pit of ice and snow. (and don&#8217;t give me any crap about the Donner Cut). Did anyone think Zod survived that? Ok so having your neck snapped like a twig might be a bit more in your face than being tossed into a ravine but dead is dead.Seems to me Man of Steel pits long time Superman purists against modern day fans who grew up in the post mid-1980s era of The Dark Knight Returns, anti-heroes like The Punisher and Lobo, and The Death of Superman storyline.  Man of Steel is very much a Superman film for the modern age, delving far more into socially conscious subjects like bullying and individuality than the Christopher Reeve films of 1970s and 1980s which were pure comic book cheese&#8230;but good cheese.Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer give a new take on the planet Krypton and its destruction.  They design Superman&#8217;s home world as one that is a mix of the high-tech and the primitive.  This isn&#8217;t the stark, emotionless world of the Reeve films but rather one of great passion and angst.  The Kryptonians have sealed their planet&#8217;s fate by stripping their world&#8217;s resources and destabilizing their core.  The ruling council is overthrown by General Zod (Shannon) and the military but not before Jor-El (Crowe) can blast his newborn son off the dying planet, infusing him with the genetic codex of the entire Kryptonian race.  Zod kills Jor-El but he and his followers and captured and banished to the Phantom Zone.  However when Krypton explodes, Zod and his soldiers are freed and track Kal-El to Earth where he has now grown into an adult.Henry Cavill&#8217;s Clark Kent/Superman is one who is very unsure of his place in the world.  He lives as a loner, travelling from place to place working odd jobs and saving people quietly and under the radar. He infiltrates a military operation in the artic that is investigating an ancient Kryptonian ship found in the ice.  The ship&#8217;s activation sends out a distress call leading Zod to Earth where he demands that Superman surrender to him.People may still be unfamiliar with Michael Shannon but he is an incredible actor.  His portrayal of Zod is many layered.  Zod is a tragic and sympathetic figure.  He&#8217;s not motivated by a lust for power but rather the desire to see his race survive and who can argue with him for that?  Man of Steel is laden with performances that work on many levels and depth which the Reeve films often lacked.  That&#8217;s not a criticism against the Reeve films.  Those films accomplished what they set out to do in making pure comic book magic come to life.  It&#8217;s just we see these familiar characters doing things we haven&#8217;t seen before.  From Diane Lane&#8217;s caring and vulnerable turn as &#8220;Ma Kent&#8221; to Lawrence Fishburne&#8217;s caring portrayal of Daily Planet Editor Perry White.The battle in Metropolis between Superman and Zod results in the kind of wholesale destruction that you&#8217;d expect to see.  Snyder doesn&#8217;t candy coat the resulting devastation.  Entire city blocks lie in ruin and while we don&#8217;t see it, no doubt thousands had to have perished in the battle.  It&#8217;s a grim picture to be sure.  But here is where Man of Steel falls somewhat short.  It doesn&#8217;t feel heroic.  It lacks those rousing moments that made you cheer such as when Superman catches Lois Lane freefalling from a building or challenging Zod to &#8220;step outside&#8221;.  Those moments accompanied by the unforgettable score by John Williams have become the stuff of cinematic legend.  This is one time when a big hunk of comic book cheese was sorely needed.Blu-Ray ExtrasJourney of Discover: Creating the Man of Steel (2:54:00) &#8211; this nearly three hour feature is integrated into the film itself and features pop up split screen and even triple screen commentary by Snyder, the cast and crew breaking down just about every scene in the film.

It's unfortunate that I conclude that this movie felt more like the aforementioned movies and miniseries' than Superman. I strongly feel that this movie is a sellout from a creative standpoint.

The trailers looked great. And then as the film rolled I sunk lower and lower in my seat until I just couldn't stand it anymore and left when the final battle got underway. Believe the negative reviews from many of the professional film critics. Nolan might have been involved as a producer, but he wasn't the principal script writer and he wasn't the director, and that makes all the difference. The script was terrible. The direction was terrible. The only reason I can come up with for the film's popularity among so many Superman fans is that they have been so hungry for a film that they would have liked almost anything. I give it 2 stars for at least trying to make Superman relevant again.The thing to remember is that even though Superman has Kryptonian abilities, his personality is 100% human. He was raised since infancy on a farm in Kansas. He might feel different, but at heart he is a small town American and this film completely missed that. In focusing on the 'alien among us' angle, they gutted Superman's personality that was so well portrayed by Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh. The Clark Kent we have all come to know and love through the years was completely missing. There were so many elements of the plot that made no sense. There was CGI overkill. Superman Returns had some plot problems, and could have put Superman in a few more action scenes, but overall that movie was far more faithful to the origins of the Superman character.The fact that Avengers was so successful should prove that a superhero movie doesn't have to copy The Dark Knight to be a hit. A superhero movie can be light, it can be funny, it can be human, and still be a fantastic movie. I have nothing to say about the relationship of this movie to recent comic book adaptations or graphic novels.

And now that Man Of Steel has been made I can never see myself going back to any other Superman film. Here is why:The Cast:Whether it be Costner or Crowe, Adams or Lane the cast was top notch and treated this Superman with respect. Did I leave out Cavill? Cavill had many doubters asking themselves ""why"" when he was cast. Though after this film's release I couldn't imagine anyone doubting him anymore. Cavill was top notch and above and beyond what I expected, he is the Man Of Steel. One could nitpick this film like many others (Star Wars, 2001, etc) but not I and in my eyes Man Of Steel is a perfect Superman film and it deserves a perfect score.The Director:Say what you will about Zack Snyder but he does know action and very much knows how to treat an audience visually. And despite some claiming he cannot develop character well he can. He really had a strong vision as to what David Goyer and Nolan had come up with and despite speculation well this is Snyder's baby and it was as soon as the script was in his hands. If you watched 300 or Watchmen and then Man Of Steel and still feel you must doubt him then that is to bad as he is one of Hollywood's best blockbuster directors.The Writers:While the screenplay was written by David Goyer, Christopher Nolan helped with the story. Both whom worked as writer/director respectively in the 'Dark Knight Trilogy"" having said that I need not say anything more. They are top notch and have proven it many times.My review was not intended to state the obvious about the plot or give spoilers. Instead I will say that if you think you were a Superman fan before watching this just wait because once Man Of Steel is over you'll feel like a kid again. Everyone from the cast, writers, director all gave it their all and IMO made the best Superman to date.5/5 Stars.",5,Man Of Steel comes into the 21st century with everything done right!,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,1940,"['First', 'foremost', 'respect', 'Reeve', 'films', 'even', 'respect', 'Singer', 'Returns', 'nonetheless', 'were', 'far', 'perfect', 'now', 'Man', 'Steel', 'been', 'made', 'can', 'never', 'see', 'going', 'back', 'other', 'Superman', 'film', 'Here', 'why', 'Cast', 'Whether', 'be', 'Costner', 'Crowe', 'Adams', 'Lane', 'cast', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'treated', 'Superman', 'respect', 'Did', 'leave', 'out', 'Cavill', 'Cavill', 'had', 'many', 'doubters', 'asking', 'why', 'when', 'was', 'cast', 'film', 'release', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'doubting', 'anymore', 'Cavill', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'above', 'what', 'expected', 'Man', 'Steel', 'One', 'could', 'nitpick', 'film', 'many', 'others', 'Star', 'Wars', '2001', 'etc', 'not', 'eyes', 'Man', 'Steel', 'perfect', 'Superman', 'film', 'perfect', 'score.The', 'Director', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'about', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'know', 'action', 'very', 'much', 'how', 'treat', 'audience', 'visually', 'claiming', 'can', 'not', 'develop', 'character', 'well', 'can', 'really', 'had', 'strong', 'vision', 'what', 'David', 'Goyer', 'Nolan', 'had', 'come', 'up', 'speculation', 'well', 'Snyder', 'baby', 'was', 'as', 'soon', 'script', 'was', 'hands', 'watched', '300', 'Watchmen', 'then', 'Man', 'Steel', 'still', 'feel', 'must', 'doubt', 'then', 'bad', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'blockbuster', 'directors.The', 'Writers', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'David', 'Goyer', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'helped', 'story', 'whom', 'worked', 'writer/director', 'respectively', ""'Dark"", 'Knight', 'Trilogy', 'having', 'said', 'need', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'have', 'proven', 'many', 'times.My', 'review', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'state', 'obvious', 'plot', 'give', 'spoilers', 'Instead', 'will', 'say', 'think', 'were', 'Superman', 'fan', 'watching', 'just', 'wait', 'once', 'Man', 'Steel', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'kid', 'again', 'Everyone', 'cast', 'writers', 'director', 'gave', 'IMO', 'made', 'best', 'Superman', 'date.5/5', 'Stars']",N/A

RHEAULT,"[3, 9]","As someone who really enjoyedSuperman Returns- which I know puts me in the minority as far as fanboys are concerned (although, to be fair, also puts me with the the majority of Rotten Tomato movie critics)- I had hoped that Warner Bros. would  give director Bryan Singer the opportunity to make a sequel in the Richard Donner-verse he had reprised in his 2006 film.  However, with the prevailing opinion that Superman Returns was not a good movie and did not do as well as it should have financially because Superman doesn't punch someone, we were given this ""Man of Steel"" reboot.  Given my disappointment of a studio doing yet another reboot (on the heels' of last year's too-soon [IMHO]The Amazing Spider-Manreboot), this movie had two strikes against it in my mind when I went to see it.  However, color me ""pleasantly surprised.""Okay, if you're on the fence as to whether to go to see ""Man of Steel"" (or buy it on DVD/Blu-Ray), I'll keep this simple.  If you enjoyed the fight scenes between Superman and the Phantom Zone villains inSuperman II, and would like to see them played out over the course of 40 minutes in a CGI slugfest of punches, explosions, and buildings being demolished ""Transformers""/Michael Bay style, you will love Man of Steel.*Spoilers ahead*  In short, Man of Steel combines the plotlines of the original Superman and Superman II - giving us, once again, the destruction of Krypton to begin the film.  Then the movie proceeds in a non-linear manner, showing us Clark Kent's upbringing, eventually leading to his donning of the iconic Superman suit.  The non-sequential manner of the initial scenes- beginning with Clark as an adult, then as a young child, then as an adult again, then as a teenager, etc.- was initially confusing, but I came to appreciate their merit as the movie progressed.  Eventually General Zod and his henchmen arrive on Earth and the battle royal is on, with Superman fighting the Phantom Zone villains in Smallville and eventually in Metropolis in an epic clash featuring excellent CGI effects that I found thrilling (even if they go on a bit too long- more on this later).*Casting* Everyone is perfectly cast in this film.  Henry Cavill is excellent as Clark and Superman; I look forward to seeing more of him in the (presumably) inevitable sequel, when hopefully he is given some lighter material to work with instead of constantly having to wear a grim expression as he goes about saving the world.  Amy Adams (as Lois Lane) is excellent as always, as is Russell Crowe (Jor-El), Kevin Costner (Jonathan Kent), and Diane Lane (Martha Kent).  Michael Shannon is also good as General Zod, but perhaps falls a bit short of Terence Stamp's almost regal villainy as the original cinematic Zod.  A special word of praise has to be directed to Antje Traue's performance as the Phantom Zone criminal Faora.  Channeling Sarah Douglas' Ursa from Superman I/II, Traue's Faora dishes out death without hesitation or remorse; moving and fighting in a vaguely serpentine manner, she takes pleasure in her killings and destruction, making her a delicious villain to watch.*Soundtrack* I consider John Williams' soundtrack from theSuperman: The Movieto be not only classic, but iconic; thus, I would have preferred that director Zack Snyder and composer Hans Zimmer retain the Williams theme.  Alas, this was not to be.  The talented Zimmer gives it his best shot and swings for the fences, hitting a solid double with his Man of Steel soundtrack.  It probably won't make you forget the Williams theme (or have you absent-mindedly humming it to yourself, as many Superman fans- myself included- have done with the Williams theme), but it is appropriately epic and even memorable in its main theme.I would have given this movie five stars but for two reasons (again *Spoilers Ahead*):1.  *The movie's length*  At 143 minutes, this movie is probably 30 minutes too long.  In particular, I think the final battle between Superman and Zod could have been trimmed down.  This Superman-Zod fight sequence comes on the heels of an extended battle sequence between Superman, the Phantom Zone villains, and the U.S. military- as a viewer I felt a bit spent.  I love the final battle itself, leading to the brilliant scene depicting  Superman's first choice as to whether to take a life in order to save innocent lives, but I didn't need to see another 10 CGI buildings destroyed with the accompanying explosions.  I'm sorry but eventually endless CGI mayhem gets a bit numbing, and loses its punch (no pun intended).2.  *Where's the joy?*  One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Superman learns to fly.  In a manner reminiscent of Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man learning to web-sling inSpider-Man, Superman gets the hang of flying and you can see the joy and wonder on his face as he zooms across the world, and eventually into space and back to Earth.  This sequence was one of the few where we see Superman actually experiencing some fun of being a God-like superhuman (as I'm sure we all would feel in his place), and I just wish there were more scenes like that.  Richard Donner really captured this whimsical aspect of the Superman character in his iconic 1978 film, and I think it is regrettable that writer David S. Goyer didn't heed the advice of one of his iconic Batman characters in writing the Man of Steel screenplay: ""Why so serious?!""In summary, Superman is back and I look forward to the next movie installment and hopefully a Justice League movie.  If the next film retains the epic nature/scope of Man of Steel, while upping the ""fun"" factor of Superman's character and not going overboard on the CGI, we may have the ultimate Superman movie to look forward to.In the meantime, Man of Steel is a dandy film, and well worth your time if you are a Superman fan or a fan of action/superhero films in general.  To borrow the catchphrase from the original 1978 movie, you will believe - again - that a man can fly.",4,Superman Returns - Again!,1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,5961,"['someone', 'who', 'really',

1562319,A1TXEMVNBAPXSR,B008JFUPFI,"Troy Lyons ""troythegeek""","[1, 2]","I've never seen a movie about Superman be so devisive as this one.  Yes, I'm partial to the Christopher Reeve films, but I also understand that times change.  Superman has been attempted to be rebooted in the comics multiple times and they always end up going back to the basics.  This is the first reboot attempt on film and it does some things right, but many things wrong.What worked?- Krypton.  The beginning of this film is gold.  The worst parts of the Reeve film was the silly Krypton parts.  This movie does that right and it is perfectly cast and executed.  I want to see more of this Krypton and Crowe as Jor-El.- Henry Cavill.  At times I saw Reeve and Tom Welling from Smallville in Cavill.  He has the look and build and I had no problems with his portrayal.- Zod.  Michael Shannon did a great job as Zod.  He felt more like the Zod from the past several years in the comics.  A soldier that loves Krypton and wants to protect it at all costs.What didn't work?Amy Adams.  I just didn't like her as Lois.  My opinion softened a little after watching it a second time, but Lois needs more bite than I think Adams can deliver.Secret identity. He did nothing to protect it in this movie.  Lois figured it out in no time and it wouldn't be hard for anyone else to either.Jonathan Kent.  Costner did fine in the role, but he just doesn't act like any Jonathan we've seen before.  He protects his son, that much is true, but the way he teaches him is all wrong.The ending.  I can't discuss without spoiling, but I hated the ending.  Many defend Superman's decision as being necessary, but that choice goes against 75 years of history about the character.  Yes, the same decision has been made in comics, but it has always been retconned.  Superman does what he does to protect a single family.  This is true to the character, but that same character does nothing to avoid the destruction of building after building in the city.  Buildings that fall on top of people and that could be full of people.  Why would he care so much about one family, but not seem to care about the potential deaths of hundreds of other people?It's a first step in a revamp.  I'm hoping that the events in this movie shape the character into more of what Superman traditionally has been.  If that is the case, then I will see this movie in a different light.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure if the Superman/Batman/Wonder Woman filled sequel will allow the character to develop.  Time will tell.",3,I'm glad the name Superman was never mentioned in this movie,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,2474,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'Superman', 'be', 'so', 'devisive', 'one', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'partial', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'films', 'also', 'understand', 'times', 'change', 'Superman', 'been', 'attempted', 'be', 'rebooted', 'comics', 'multiple', 'times', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'back', 'basics', 'first', 'reboot', 'attempt', 'film', 'things', 'right', 'many', 'things', 'wrong.What', 'worked', 'Krypton', 'beginning', 'film', 'gold', 'worst', 'parts', 'Reeve', 'film', 'was', 'silly', 'Krypton', 'parts', 'movie', 'right', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'executed', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'Krypton', 'Crowe', 'Jor-El.-', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'times', 'saw', 'Reeve', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Smallville', 'Cavill', 'look', 'build', 'had', 'problems', 'portrayal.-', 'Zod', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Zod', 'felt', 'more', 'Zod', 'past', 'several', 'years', 'comics', 'soldier', 'Krypton', 'protect', 'costs.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Lois', 'opinion', 'softened', 'little', 'watching', 'second', 'time', 'Lois', 'more', 'bite', 'think', 'Adams', 'can', 'deliver.Secret', 'identity', 'did', 'nothing', 'protect', 'movie', 'Lois', 'figured', 'out', 'time', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'hard', 'anyone', 'else', 'either.Jonathan', 'Kent', 'Costner', 'did', 'fine', 'role', 'just', ""n't"", 'act', 'Jonathan', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'son', 'much', 'true', 'way', 'wrong.The', 'ending', 'ca', ""n't"", 'discuss', 'spoiling', 'hated', 'ending', 'Many', 'defend', 'Superman', 'decision', 'being', 'necessary', 'choice', '75', 'years', 'history', 'character', 'Yes', 'same', 'decision', 'been', 'made', 'comics', 'always', 'been', 'retconned', 'Superman', 'what', 'protect', 'single', 'family', 'true', 'character', 'same', 'character', 'nothing', 'avoid', 'destruction', 'building', 'building', 'city', 'Buildings', 'fall', 'top', 'people', 'could', 'be', 'full', 'people', 'Why', 'would', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'family', 'not', 'seem', 'care', 'potential', 'deaths', 'hundreds', 'other', 'people', 'first', 'step', 'revamp', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'events', 'movie', 'character', 'more', 'what', 'Superman', 'traditionally', 'been', 'case', 'then', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'different', 'light', 'Unfortunately', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Superman/Batman/Wonder', 'Woman', 'filled', 'sequel', 'will', 'allow', 'character', 'develop', 'Time', 'will', 'tell']",N/A

""Man of Steel"" takes itself very seriously, with the re-imagined DC Comics hero that is much darker than you would expect. This is not surprising after all because the 2013 film is directed by Zack Snyder of ""Watchmen,"" co-produced by Christopher Nolan and written by David S. Goyer, which is based on a story by Nolan and Goyer.From the very opening that describes the last day of Planet Krypton with spectacular visuals, you know ""Man of Steel"" is going to be different. After the promising start, however, the film's narrative gets more and more complex with frequent flashbacks to Superman/Kal-El's younger days. This might have worked with Christopher Nolan who effectively employs non-linear narrative to make his characters' back stories more intriguing, but Snyder only confuses us, making the film's pace slower than necessary.When the Kryptonian warriors led by General Zod (Michael Shannon) arrive, the action finally picks up, but despite the big and loud sequences (with flying cars and so many destroyed buildings), the effect-ridden climactic action becomes soon repetitious. No matter how fast and high he flies like a supersonic plane, Superman here (played by Henry Cavill) looks like just another action superhero, humorless and frustrated, and nothing more.Plus, there is a subplot about a Daily Planet journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams), who meets Superman in the most contrived way. This is a visually dazzling re-imagination of the Superman saga that could have been much better with a more skilled storyteller.",3,Visually Dazzling Re-Imagination Needs a Better Storyteller,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,1661,"['What', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'here', 'Man', 'Steel', 'not', 'Superman', 'Actually', 'IS', 'Superman', 'not', 'one', 'knew', 'past', 'Man', 'Steel', 'very', 'seriously', 're-imagined', 'DC', 'Comics', 'hero', 'much', 'darker', 'would', 'expect', 'not', 'surprising', '2013', 'film', 'directed', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'Watchmen', 'co-produced', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'written', 'David', 'S.', 'Goyer', 'based', 'story', 'Nolan', 'Goyer.From', 'very', 'opening', 'last', 'day', 'Planet', 'Krypton', 'spectacular', 'visuals', 'know', 'Man', 'Steel', 'going', 'be', 'different', 'promising', 'start', 'however', 'film', 'narrative', 'more', 'more', 'complex', 'frequent', 'flashbacks', 'Superman/Kal-El', 'younger', 'days', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'who', 'effectively', 'non-linear', 'narrative', 'make', 'characters', 'back', 'stories', 'more', 'intriguing', 'Snyder', 'only', 'making', 'film', 'pace', 'slower', 'Kryptonian', 'warriors', 'led', 'General', 'Zod', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'arrive', 'action', 'finally', 'up', 'big', 'loud', 'sequences', 'flying', 'cars', 'so', 'many', 'destroyed', 'buildings', 'effect-ridden', 'climactic', 'action', 'soon', 'repetitious', 'matter', 'how', 'fast', 'high', 'supersonic', 'plane', 'Superman', 'here', 'played', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'like', 'just', 'action', 'superhero', 'humorless', 'frustrated', 'nothing', 'more.Plus', 'subplot', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'journalist', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'who', 'Superman', 'most', 'contrived', 'way', 'visually', 'dazzling', 're-imagination', 'Superman', 'saga', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'skilled', 'storyteller']",N/A
1562325,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B008JFUPFI,Turfseer,"[10, 16]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***For those who are not completely convinced that the latest Superman reboot, 'Man of Steel', is nothing more than a bloated, overwrought mess, please consult the CinemaSins series on Youtube entitled, 'Everything Wrong With Man Of Steel In 8 Minutes Or Less'. This hilarious video summarizes all the absurdities of the 'Man of Steel' narrative as promised (In 8 Minutes Or less!). Perhaps the most absurd scene highlighted is when Superman saves Lois Lane while she's falling toward earth while everything else is being sucked into a vortex in the other direction.Superman begins with an incredibly long twenty minute or so sequence chronicling the destruction of the planet Krypton which could have been done in a much more compact five minutes. When General Zod (played by Michael Shannon of Boardwalk Empire fame, sporting a bowl cut haircut) attempts to stop Superman's father Jor-EL from sending his newborn son, the future Superman, in a spaceship to earth, he fails to stop the launch after getting into an absurd fistfight with Jor-EL without the assistance of any of his minions (who could have easily accompanied him to the launch site and destroyed the launch console).If all signs pointed to the fact that Krypton was doomed, why does the council of Elders sentence Zod and his crew to the Phantom Zone? The destruction of the planet means that the device that controls the Phantom Zone will be destroyed, thus releasing Zod from his eternal prison. They would have known this. Instead, Zod and company could have been put into stasis and launched in a spaceship, where it would have been much more likely they would have never been found in the vastness of outer space.If you're expecting to see Superman disguised as ""mild mannered reporter"" Clark Kent, working for the Daily Planet, you will be disappointed. Clark Kent the reporter only appears at the end of the film and now you will have to wait for the sequel to see him. Instead, Clark pursues a nomadic lifestyle working in such places as a fishing trawler and using his superpowers to save lives (for example) during the collapse of an oil rig.During these sequences, we're also treated to flashbacks detailing Clark's ostracism amongst his peers while he's growing up and how he redeems himself (again for example) by saving his schoolmates after a bus plunges into a river. Kevin Costner and Diana Lane do an excellent, understated job as Ma and Pa Kent but the scene in which Jonathan Kent chooses to sacrifice himself, to save the family dog, doesn't ring true. Why doesn't Clark try to save his father as the tornado bears down? After depositing his mother at the underpass, using his super speed, no one would have seen him, as he could have flown into the tornado and shifted its direction, so that his father wouldn't have been swept away.Somehow Clark then manages to get a job working at a secret military site investigating what turns out to be a Kryptonian ship buried in the Artic ice. There he learns about his origins from a hologram of Jor-EL. The hologram is so prescient that he later even recognizes Lois Lane. In the sci-fi universe, I was always under the impression that the ability of holograms to communicate with humans was quite limited (perhaps answering yes and no questions, as in the film, 'I, Robot'). But here Russell Crowe's ability to communicate appears unlimited.And another thing while Clark is down there in the ice, snooping around. Why doesn't Superman, utilizing his super hearing, hear Lois enter the cave and prevent her from being injured? Instead, he ends up using his X-ray vision to repair Lois' wound, and she's in agony while undergoing the procedure.Even if you're willing to suspend your disbelief concerning all these contrivances, the rest of 'Man of Steel' is a big bore. The problem is that the human characters here are an afterthought. Compared to the superpowers of Superman and Zod, humans are absolutely helpless as the good guy and bad guys from Krypton, battle it out. Perry White (played by a solid Lawrence Fishburne) has little to do except save one of his employees after she's trapped when a piece of concrete falls on her. Lois Lane is given the small task of using a special key to jump start the craft that Superman came to earth in, which is used by the US military to send Zod's minions, back to the phantom zone.Before battling Zod in Metropolis, Superman must dispose of the Krypton bad girl, Faora and another Kryptonian. Those sequences are no different than the final battle with Zod, where trucks are thrown into buildings and each principal punch one another, where they themselves end up being thrown great distances into such recognizable structures as the International House of Pancakes (IHOP).As so cogently pointed out in 'CinemaSins' on Youtube, after the ridiculously long battle between Zod and Superman, the Man of Steel ends the whole thing by merely snapping Zod's neck. Before that, even with Zod being thrown into a building which collapses on him, that isn't enough, to do the trick. Presumably, Zod is so spent that Superman is then able to kill him by such a sleight of hand. But after all the grand CGI effects, the snapping of the neck, is a big let down (and not very believable, to boot).If your thing is special effects, then 'Man of Steel' is for you. But if you require that Superman be all about the human interactions between the characters, then go elsewhere. May I suggest purchasing the complete collection of the original 1950s Superman TV Series? The special effects back then were nothing to jump up and down about, but the 50s incarnations of the iconic characters of Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Perry White and Jimmy Olsen, were all so endearing.",2,Human characters get short shrift in this unimpressive effects laden superhero slug-fest,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",2013,5765,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***For',

Zack Snyder a man in my eyes who can do no wrong in the world of comic book films, finally achieved what has been attempted for years...a GOOD Superman movie!Christopher Nolan has surely set the bar thanks to his Dark Knight Trilogy and with the Marvel Universe films raking in the big bucks DC has finally gotten the film needed to catch up. Man of Steel is everything I wanted in a Superman film. An origin story with a very human twist. This film was not just about a young boy with powers growing up, it was about about a hero learning to discover his own heroism. The cast was well rounded Michael Shannon did a tremendous job as Zod and Henry Cavil was exactly how I expected Superman to be. I could tell that Snyder definitely dabbled in Bruce Timm's world just a little bit while he is a man with powers beyond humans, he showed a weakness and vulnerability. Finally, what I loved the most was we finally got a Superman film in which Superman actually fights! The action sequences were fast and furious exactly what a battle between Kryptonians should be.Of course people do have their gripes one of which is the fact that there was no real love story between Superman and Lois Lane, I didn't find that a problem. I feel there was no place for it in this movie because once again it was about Superman becoming Superman. What I really was happy about was that unlike Bryan Singers' Superman Returns, this film didn't try to go back to find the glory days. No John Williams theme, no classic Superman taglines, just an in your face raw and fresh adaption of The Man of Steel.Thank goodness this film did well because the flood gates are finally about to open with a sequel on the horizon which will feature two more DC comic book heroes, including the first film adaption of Wonder Woman.

I must confess to being let-down. I am not a huge Superman fan. I did enjoy the Christoper Reeve versions but that's about it. I'm a Batman fan. But when I heard this was coming out, for some reason I was giddy with excitement. While others were in shock that a British man would be playing Superman, I was excited. I had just finished watching The Tudors when the announcement was made(Cavill is fantastic in it!) and I was surprised, and excited. Henry Cavill is a great actor. Subtle, but commanding. I did not mind his Superman. In fact, his brooding nature was a positive in my mind. I wanted a more serious version of Superman than the ones previously made. Cavill is not at fault here.The main problem with Man of Steel is it just feels discombobulated. The pacing felt off and the flashbacks, which I assume were supposed to help form a backstory, just felt out of place. They took you away from the drama and distorted the focus of the film. It's nice to see how Clark established himself as a human, always trying to fit in. His life was clearly not an easy one, but he was certainly loved by his adoptive parents ( Diane Lane and Kevin Costner). It's not that I minded the flashbacks aspect of it, I just didn't quite like the way they were handled.Amy Adams is adorable. But she isn't Louis Lane. She isn't even pretending to be a reporter. She offered nothing to this tale, not even romantic attachement. Her 'relationship' with Clark felt forced and just odd. She might as well have been eliminated from the film alltogether.Michael Shannon as Zod did OK with what he had, although it was a bit over the top at points. His climactic fight scene with Superman was borderline comical since they managed to destroy 90% of Metropolis within minutes. His backstory isn't very interesting either.There are quite a few things going for Man of Steel-Visual effects, musical score, his costume(which I really liked), and of course Superman himself.

1562336,A39RPTCDEWG7RL,B008JFUPFI,Vamphaery,"[7, 11]","Warning: This review will contain spoilers. Please do not read if you do not wish to know anything about the film or its plot.I am a lifelong Superman fan, both on film and in the comics. The first movie I ever saw as a child was the original Donner film. Watching Superman films - good, bad, and ugly - has been a tradition in my family for over 30 years. I was an avid collector and reader of the comics in my youth. I cried when ""The Death Of Superman"" reached its bloody climax. And while not exactly a comics aficionado today, I do still peek in to follow the latest New 52 incarnations of this character that has meant so much to me over the years. My love of Superman is probably second only to my love of Star Trek.With those ""credentials,"" such as they are, having been stated... let's get this out of the way. This is not ""The Dark Knight"" of Superman films. Nor is it ""The Avengers"" of Superman Films. For those hoping for, at long last, a cinematic experience starring DC's flagship hero equal to the very best super hero films Hollywood has had to offer in recent years... this still exceptional film falls just shy of the mark. It may be, however, the ""Batman Begins"" or ""Iron Man"" of Superman films. And for a franchise that has arguably not successfully produced a great film since the 1980s, that is saying a great deal.I mentioned my love of Star Trek above for a reason. The recent Star Trek reboot and its sequel Into Darkness hurt me to watch. I mean they literally hurt. They broke my heart. That sounds like hyperbole, but to justify this review it's important that people understand how much I love these properties and these characters. The new Trek films were fun summer action flicks. They were even great reasons to expect JJ Abrams to bring us a good Star Wars film in the future (I do love Star Wars as well - who doesn't?) But they were so antithetical to the spirit, premise, and themes of Star Trek by my personal standards that knowing they would be all an entire generation would ever grow up equating with the words ""Star Trek"" literally depressed me.So it should not be taken lightly when I say that Man of Steel in my opinion manages something I doubted was even necessarily possible: the creation of a modern, contemporary, unique take on the mythos, premise, and spirit of Superman - both as a character and a symbol - that works as a movie accessible to modern audiences, AND a validation of what Superman is all about, without compromise.What is Superman all about you ask? Well, the answer to that will differ a bit depending upon who you ask. But there are certain core elements I think we can all agree on. Superman is a hero in the truest, most pure sense. He seeks only to serve and protect the people of Earth. He has a dual heritage - Kryptonian and American - yet is ultimately a citizen of Earth and a champion of humanity.He is sent to Earth just before Krypton's imminent destruction. He grows up on a farm in Smallville, Kansas where his human parents instill in him the values and beliefs he will carry with him in his role as a super hero. He upholds principles of compassion, fairness, and self sacrifice. He works as a reporter at the Daily Planet in Metropolis. He desires to protect life and agonizes over its loss. All of these things are utterly true by the end of Man of Steel, in a visceral, dramatic way never before depicted on film in my opinion. But it goes so far above and beyond these essentials.The approach taken to the story told here is more science fiction than comic book. We see Krypton as we never have before. A technologically advanced civilization that while far beyond any human achievement, is in decline and is a victim of its own mastery of a harsh environment. The costumes, architecture, and technology are more inspired by the comic book than any other cinematic depiction to date if you look closely, yet on a more general aesthetic level are akin to something you might see in Prometheus or the machine world of The Matrix Revolutions. And this synergy between the comics and cinematic, grounded reality runs throughout the film.The primary antagonist, Zod, is not merely a mustache twirling caricature of evil, but a true General; a military man with a clearly defined mission and purpose, his own principles, and credible - even relatable, if frightening - motives. By the film's conclusion, his story is almost more tragic than it is deplorable. This is a testament to Michael Shannon's intense yet subtle performance, which not only gives us a take on Zod we've not seen before, but also gives the conflict between he and both Russell Crowe and Henry Cavill emotional depth that I found surprising and welcome.Russell Crowe for his part delivers a beautifully delicate performance, first on Krypton as a father sacrificing his son (with Ayelet Zurer doing the same as his mother,) and then as a just-ever-so-different (that's the delicate part) AI recreation of the same man. The difference is almost intangible but is there, and that change was a brilliantly understated bit of acting by Crowe. His scenes with Shannon in particular really sizzled.Surprisingly, it is these emotional qualities which give the film its strength. This is equally true of Clark's relationship with his Earthly parents, the Kents. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are wonderfully compassionate and restrained in their performances, as they imbue that restraint and patience into a Clark/Kal struggling with his powers and the weight of responsibility that comes with them. This stirring affection and love make Kevin Costner's sacrifice to protect Clark's secret all the more tear jerking when it comes.Much has been made about this scene and how ""Superman would never do this,"" but I say that's precisely the point. At this point in his life, Clark ISN'T Superman. He's a young adult trying to figure out who he is and what to do with his life, and his father's insistence upon secrecy weighed heavily upon him. It isn't until later that we see Superman take flight and become the character we know and love. I fully understand and appreciate that people don't want this to be the way Jonathan perishes, but it isn't a failure of consistency with Superman's characterization; it's a manifestation of WHERE he is on his journey toward BECOMING Superman eventually, at that point in time.While on the topic of points of contention... another arguable ""inconsistency"" people debate is Clark's powers being neutralized aboard the ship. Although not explained as transparently or forthrightly as it could have been, which makes the confusion understandable, this IS explained. The use of the word ""atmosphere"" seems to be what throws people off, but another word is used just before that: ecology. And that's a more appropriate term, as Earth's ecology includes solar radiation.The interior of the ship not only simulates Krypton's atmosphere, but as the interrogator states, it also neutralizes the effect of Earth's sun. There is no contradiction here between the two. It simply does BOTH. We can see this by virtue of the fact that Zod is fine on the ship, but again becomes overwhelmed by his enhanced senses upon exposing himself to Earth's atmosphere and sun again.Returning to the review... Amy Adams' Lois Lane is a delight and finally gives us a portrayal that is true to the nuances of her relationship with Clark in the comics. She is, first and foremost, a skilled reporter that doesn't shy away from arduous or dangerous assignments. The film also deftly leapfrogs over the ""why can't she tell Clark is Superman if she's such a great investigative journalist?"" problem, rather than insulting her intelligence.But perhaps just as importantly, by the film's end we see a level of empathic comprehension on Lois' part of what Superman truly suffers because of the burden only he can bear. This is critical, because her knowledge not only of his identity but of his burden is what makes them effective partners - and not just romantically - in the comics. And this is the first time that has been articulated this well on film in my opinion. Her determined sparring with the almost always great Laurence Fishburne as Perry White successfully establishes a contentious but mutually respectful relationship between editor and reporter as well.Antje Traue as Zod's second in command, Faora-Ul, was a surprisingly awesome addition to the film. Her fight with Superman was arguably the most memorable, and her intimidating, amoral lust for battle was genuinely cold. Her insistence that, ""You will not win. For every million you save, we will kill a million more,"" underlined just what was at stake, and her wince of pain due to her senses being overwhelmed - as Zod's and Clark's had been earlier as their powers emerged and normalized - was pitch perfect.Which, eventually, brings us to the controversial final confrontation between Clark and Zod. So much has been made of this that I almost feel reticent to even bring it up, but the record needs to be set straight. That Superman does not kill is a myth. Period. It's not a matter of opinion, it's not up for debate. Superman has killed before, both on film and in the comics. Full stop. This is not the unprecedented breach of characterization that so many have made it out to be.Moreover, the film sets this up beautifully. Earlier in the movie, we see Clark learning to fly. He jumps several times before soaring briefly. He then loses control and falls awkwardly. It took real effort to control his powers, as we see several times and at different points. After Zod says to Clark, ""I was bred to be a warrior, Kal. Trained my entire life to master my senses,"" he effortlessly throws off his armor, and gracefully hovers into the air. Kal looks on, a mixture of fear and surprise on his face.Clearly we are meant to comprehend at this moment that Zod is mastering his powers faster than Kal ever did. He has been on Earth for days, and is already nearly equal to Clark in strength and ability. (Which makes perfect sense, given his genetic design.) And he's a better fighter than Clark, who has had to restrain himself from combat all his life for fear or harming powerless humans.Zod makes it abundantly clear, ""Either you die, or I do."" When begged to stop he replies simply, with his convictions and madness at the loss of his people, his reason for being, ""Never."" He was never going to stop. The phantom singularity had already been created and used so banishing him wasn't an option. He was becoming more powerful. He was about to kill innocent human beings, and after that, would have gone on to kill more.Within the context of the story being told here, and as presented with abundant clarity, Kal had no other choice. We can speculate all day about how he could have ""flown away"" with Zod or ""taken the fight elsewhere,"" but it's quite clear that he could barely even restrain him.The other point I see frequently raised is the massive damage to the city. I counter this with another important aspect of Clark's journey. That being, that this is his first time engaging in combat as Superman against a similarly powered opponent... or perhaps more pertinently, ANY opponent, ever. Before these Kryptonians arrived on Earth, he never so much as killed a fly.You can see this in the way he actually FLEES to avoid being shot by the gunships during his fight with Faora. He doesn't even know yet that bullets don't hurt him! Later we see him flinch as he takes a bullet to the head. It seems to me that this, although subtle, was his first exposure to the knowledge that he is bulletproof. And as he fights Zod, it's clear that he's being tossed around against his will as much as he's trying to put the beat down on an implacable foe threatening humanity.But even setting all of that aside... seriously... if you've read the comics, then you know Metropolis gets trashed in virtually every issue! It amazes me that The Avengers and Loki can destroy most of Manhattan, people can complain that in Superman Returns Kal never throws a punch, and the comics can depict devastation on an unimaginable scale with shocking regularity... but what we get in this film, which people have asked for for years, somehow doesn't sit well with people. Really?I can only surmise that those who take issue with any of the above are not longtime fans of the character or the comics, and base their opinion of the character on a few specific comic arcs or on the Donner films. (Even though he arguably killed Zod et al in Superman II. With a smile on his face no less.) With this, I feel the arguments that Superman's actions and characterization in Man of Steel contradict the traditional values of the character, are now convincingly refuted. Feel free to disagree.Much more valid criticisms, in my opinion, would be of its pacing, and certain plot points which seem like stretches or aren't communicated as well as they might have been. (Supes leaving Faora and crew with his mother while he plows into Zod, or the vision sequence aboard Zod's ship for instance.) Or the few lackluster cgi moments (such as asphalt cracking, which seems to be a tricky thing to get right in every movie I see for some reason.) But everyone seems too busy worrying about Superman having a Superman-like fight on film (finally) to notice any of that. To each their own I suppose.And so it is with this climactic, final act that Cavill releases a remarkable cry of pain and sorrow. At having killed. At being alone. At having not found another way. At his revelation to the world having ended in death. But it is also here where some great acting by both Cavill and Adams shows us that Lois understands Clark and what he's experiencing fully. And that for all his power, Superman NEEDS the love of this human woman in order to endure his role in the world.And that, my friends,is the beauty of this depiction of Superman. There is a Man of Steel here. But there is also, simply, a man.",4,"While not perfect, I daresay this is the best Superman tale put to film since 1978.",1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,13984,"['Warning', 'review', 'will', 'contain',

1562343,A107ZX1O8JZCN5,B008JFUPFI,"Vicki Hopkins, Author ""Vicki Hopkins, Author""","[5, 13]","After being hyped up for months on end with trailers, pictures, and secrets about this movie, it's over.  Superman has arrived in a new cool suit.Wow, where do you begin?  Well, how about Russell Crowe delivering a baby on the dying planet of Krypton.  I often wonder if alien planets were out there, would their technology look as cool as the stuff we imagine?  Kudos to the minds who thought up these visuals.  Perhaps they had an alien muse from Area 51. Aside from the nifty technology, Crowe was great throughout the picture alive and dead (you'll have to figure that one out).Move onto planet earth with Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, more legends on the screen giving great performances.  The movie offers insight into Superman's younger years with terrific performance from the young lad (Dylan Sprayberry), who plays his part.  It's an internal struggle that Clark must journey on his own to find his identify.  His earthly father teaches him wisdom and restraint with his gifts, until he finally meets his real father and learns of his origins and why he is on planet earth.Enter cute Amy Adams who plays Lois Lane, destined to fall in love with Superman.  As one army woman says at the end, ""I think he's hot.""  And hot he is!  Henry Cavill did a great job in the role with the internal identity struggle and the will to do good among the humans he has lived with for thirty-plus years.  It's not until the end in order to save the planet does he finally succumb to willfully killing another to save others.  Amy is cute in her own right, falling in love with a handsome well-dressed alien in red and blue, but she is also acquainted with the man in jeans and a tee shirt.  I'm sorry, but you just can't help but wonder what making love to Superman would be like - perhaps we shouldn't go down that road.The technology of the aliens is quite cool.  The alien ships, suits, and costumes are unique. Though many humans are killed in the battle for earth, there isn't a lot of blood and gore.The only complaint I really had about the movie was the lengthy fight scenes between Superman and the aliens.  They seemed to go on forever, and frankly I think they could have cut a good half-hour out of the movie.  All right, you get the point, it's a fight of evil and good, but a few good cuts on the editing floor would have done the movie better.  My guess is the guys in special effects were like kids having too much fun seeing how many walls and buildings they could throw Superman and his enemies through.Of course, as you watch the movie you think things like -- How can he fly in space without air?  How can he get beat up for a half hour straight and not have a scratch or drop of blood on him?  How can he walk through fire?  How can he breathe under water? How could society recover at the end with so much devastation?  The list goes on and on - but hey, it's Superman!  I suppose if we ever do get invaded by aliens, I'd like this dude on my side.It's quite obvious at the end that sequels are coming, because it ends with Clark Kent getting a job at the Daily Planet to blend into society. Of course, Lois Lane, who has probably kissed him a few more times by now, knows his secret!One more note, Hans Zimmer does a great job at a musical score.  A bit dark like the Dark Knight, but nonetheless quite good.  I love the guy's music anyway.Is it worth the watch?  Sure.  Just for the story and the visuals, plus the top-notch stars in the movie.  Is it worth two-hours and twenty-three minutes?  I could have done with one and forty-five and less fighting between Superman and Zod (played by Michael Shannon), who by the way is one of those damn villains who just won't die!All in all, Superman is just super. It is not a movie filled with jokes and lighthearted scenes. It's serious. He overcomes obstacles constantly when he should have died at least twenty times in the movie from all that he went through to save the human race.  Probably a little over-the-top but that's the movies.  It's all make believe, epic sci-fi special effects, and cute Henry Cavill in one good looking suit.And it's not an ""S"" on his chest - it's a symbol that means hope.  But on earth, it's an ""S"" to us, standing for Superman.  There are some great lines in the movie that stay with you.""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards.

Henry Cavill has great potential, but he spends far too much time crashing through buildings and not enough time interacting with the other characters. The best parts are Cavill's scenes with his parents (Diane Lane and Kevin Kostner). The rest of the film is weighed down by SFX overkill. The screenwriters' vision of Superman isn't the mysterious, slightly sinister figure of the early years (1938-48) or the squeaky-clean hero of the middle period (1949-86), but rather a conflicted outcast in the mold of Wolverine or Spiderman. That's a sad fate for the costumed superhero archetype. The story is bland but functional and a talented cast do their best with weak material, especially Russell Crowe who tries hard to make a dull origin story interesting.

1562354,A1C80B497LCYKA,B008JFUPFI,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[11, 19]","After a mediocre Iron Man 3 and a good-but-not-great Star Trek: Into Darkness - both films being nothing more than entertaining roller coaster rides, which is fine for some viewers but not for me - Man Of Steel delivers, not just the requisite ride, which is expected of all summer blockbuster movies, but a good story and a Christian message to boot. Henry Cavill (Immortals, The Tudors) gives us a version of Superman that is naturalistic and emotional, as opposed to Christopher Reeves' take from the 1980s that was stiff and two-dimensional. With the script, David S. Goyer (Batman Begins, Dark Knight, Dark Knight Rises) introduces us to a darkly realistic Superman: one full of introspection and doubts, full of past hurts and pain, and yet determinedly hopeful.Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Dark Knight, Dark Knight Rises) started production on the film, and then turned it over to Zack Snyder (300) to direct. I had my doubts about this triumvirate - Nolan-Snyder-Goyer - simply because Superman is not Batman, and these guys had Batman in their blood. (300 has that same ""Dark Knight"" kind of feel.) DC Comics' Superman is a character very much like Marvel Comics' Captain America - you could almost add him to the list of baseball, hot dogs and Mom's apple pie. He's all-American and he's uncomplicated. Batman, on the other hand, is darkly complex, a psychological roadmap of twists and turns. I was afraid they would turn this simple, refreshing character into a Dark Knight clone.But, delightedly, they did not. What they did do, surprisingly, is give us Superman as a Christ figure - the Son of Man as the Man of Steel. Man Of Steel is fraught with Christian symbols. Where this came from, I do not know, because, while there is a lot of spirituality in comics and graphic novels - and much of it Christian - I don't think it's this blatant. I know that Superman is the most righteous of all the superheroes - again, like Captain America, who is also full of virtue and a model for boys to follow. But to think of him as a Christ figure is to take him to a new level. Yet, there it is, throughout the film: Superman is Christ. Substitute Superman's muscles for Christ's spirit, Kansas for Galilee and Metropolis for Jerusalem and you have, in essence, the same story - the salvation of mankind by a dual-nature being - fully God and fully man.Superman is a savior. The first thing that tipped me off was the scene where Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife are putting the baby Kal-El into a spaceship destined for Earth in order to save him from the destruction of the planet Krypton. I thought, ""That is Moses being placed in the reed basket and sent down the River Nile."" Think about it. He's being sent away from destruction to a people with which he has nothing in common in order to save them. That was not only the calling of Moses, it was the calling of Christ. Notice that both Kal-El's name, and that of his father Jor-El, end in El. El in Hebrew means God. I doubt if that was an accident.Like Jesus, Kal-El (Clark) was raised by an adopted father - in his case, Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner). Kent instills in his son the idea of always being a force for good, and of always doing the right thing. He warns Clark that people may not accept him, and that they'll probably be afraid of him because of his powers; and so he needs to keep his identity a secret. This is not unlike Christ's warning to his disciples not to make His identity known.Superman begins his ""career"" of saving people at the age of 30. So did Jesus. He begins as an itinerant worker. Jesus began as an itinerant preacher. Both men did so, partly to conceal their identities, and partly to avoid their enemies.Superman discovers his origins and purpose from his father's facsimile in an arctic outpost. Moses did the same thing from a burning bush, and it could be argued that Jesus discovered these things during his 40 days and 40 nights in the wilderness. Such a""briefing"" could be said to be a rite of passage - a spiritual rite of passage. Every believer, and every great character in literature and film, has one. It is what defines them. Superman is such a character.I really like the fact that the story of Superman has a ""grunge"" phase, which is what his time as an itinerant worker is. It makes his story more real. I also like how the filmmakers tell his backstory using flashbacks. It's far more effective than if they had just told a straight chronological story, because it relates those events to his present sufferings. When Clark finally becomes Superman, he's spectacular, as you would imagine. He's got the hair, the muscles and the cape. But he has more than that. One of the things we discover in his conversations with Lois Lane is the meaning of the ""S"" on his chest: it isn't an ""S"" for Superman; rather, it's the symbol for hope on the planet Krypton. Superman represents hope. That's what Christ represents as well.As Superman, Henry Cavill has it over Christopher Reeve hands down. Not only is he more comfortable with his muscles - Reeve was stiff and bulky - but he's a far better actor. He has some very emotional scenes, and is very believable in them. His relationship with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) works well, as far as chemistry. In the analogy with Christ, we are Lois Lane - the one he loves, the one he saves time and time again, the one he would die for. The best part of Clark Kent is his struggle with himself - his attempt to reconcile his two natures - and thereby decide where his allegiances lie - with the remnant of Krypton, who are basically the bad guys; or with residents of his new home, Earth. Of course, he chooses the latter.Trust is a prime motif in Man Of Steel. I already mentioned Clark's father's advice about not trusting people with his identity. In one scene, Clark is in a church, seeking answers to the question of who he is and what he should be. As he's leaving, the pastor, in a desperate attempt to help, blurts out something to the effect of, ""Trust people."" Later, when Superman is finally recognized by Colonel Nathan Hardy (Christopher Meloni) as a friend, not an enemy, he says something to the effect of, ""I trust you."" Trust is the foundation in any relationship, and certainly with both the Man of Steel and the Son of Man.In Man Of Steel, there's the obligatory violence, as Superman fights against the bad guys - the only other survivors from the destroyed planet Krypton, who are traitors, exiled from the planet for insurrection. The leader of this group, General Zod (Michael Shanno), is not my favorite villain of all time. There is nothing compelling about him. And the final showdown with Superman is over-kill, in my opinion. It would have been just as effective - and the movie could have been brought in at 2 hours run time instead of 2:23 - by having him die with his compatriots. Must every action-adventure movie end with a final showdown? In this case, I don't think it was needed.One of my favorite scenes is the last one. I won't be giving anything away if I say that it is when Clark Kent shows up at the Daily Planet for the first time wearing his glasses, obviously promising a sequel. I thought, ""Now that is Clark Kent."" At last: an actor who can pull off both Superman and Clark Kent without one of them seeming ridiculous. Bravo!Final Note: I've mentioned before how Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan is a cultural Christ figure (http://www.waitsel.com/classic_literature/Tarzan.html). Well, so is Superman. As such, I think he's also a symbol of Righteousness (http://www.christianknighthood.com/Righteousness.html). Both of these characters came out of the early part of the 20th Century, reflecting the values of Americans at that time. Can we recapture those? We need to, and this film definitely gives promise to that hope.",5,Man Of Steel as Son Of Man - Superman as a Type of Christ,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,7817,"['mediocre', 'Iron', 'Man', '3',

A slightly different approach but remains close to the basics. The weakest point of the storyline was the love story between Lois and Clark. It just didn't jive at all. Since a large portion of the movie revolves around Lois, the poor integration of Lois into the plot weakens the movie significantly. So, once I ignored the Lois portion of the movie, the rest was really good.The acting was very good, especially from Henry Cavill. Russel Crowe was a great Jor-El. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane were good as the Clark's parents, but I feel no one will ever be as good as the parents of Superman as Annette O'Toole and John Schneider from Smallville. Michael Shannon was an excellent villain. It is nice to see Christopher Meloni in another role.The acting also had some weak points, especially from Amy Adams (Lois Lane) and Laurence Fishburne (Perry White). The audience is almost automatically made to dislike Lois and there is not a lot done to warm her up. There is a reason CSI got rid of Laurence Fishburne. Lois and Perry were by far the worst parts of this movie.The computer generated graphics were superb. Top notch.Family friendly: No cursing, no nekkid people, no sexual stuff. There is a lot of fighting and destruction.If the makers of this Superman would have left the Lois part out, or made it better, this would have been a really top notch movie.

The young Clark (whoever the Brit actor is) broods and pouts and at times yells disrespectfully to his father. That was NEVER in the real Superman concept.  This character brooded and brooded through most of the movie and finally got up enough gumption to wake up and start protecting the world from a sociopathic soldier from Krypton planning on destroying Earth.The actor was not attractive and balding. Lois was frumpy and bloated in her face. She swore and joked about men's private parts. She dressed terribly and had no manners. She was in scenes where she did not belong in. Like flying around in a military cargo plane attempting to attack the bad guys. Superman's uniform looked like dark blue waffle long johns. His cape was just a big piece of dark velvet cloth. Of course the colors HAD to be dark.Clark's mom and dad (both in Krypton and Earth) were redeeming actors--Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe added class whenever they were in the movie.The rest of the cast was just set dressing.Towards the end there was so much smashing and destroying, it got to sound like a bad video game. Superman against the bad guys. Smashing up entire cities and sky scrapers. Lois always nearby panting with fear that her heartthrob might get hurt. Yawn.

Carrabine ""Logan""","[9, 21]","This movie was an awesome action movie with a great cast from Laurence Fishbourne as Perry White to Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman. Russell Crowe did a great job as Jorell, and the back story of Krypton was also enjoyable. So how with all these great things did I feel the movie missed the mark from being the greatest Superman movie since Christopher Reeve, well here is the list and don't read further if you want to avoid SPOILERS!!!!!!!!I'm doing my list by the worst decisions made in the movie to least important.1. Superman/Clark Kent does not kill. He has a heightened sense of right and wrong, and would have stopped Zod without killing him. Superman is the Boyscout, and would not cross that line. Batman would be more apt kill someone for the greater good, and even he has principle about killing. That last scene in the movie ruined the whole film for me personally.2. The first 20 minutes or so of the film I felt I was watching Batman Begins again. You can defiantly tell Christopher Nolan directed this film since he took the story ideas from Batman begins and brought it directly to Man of Steel. No where in the comics did Clark Kent travel on a fishing ship all rugged trying to find himself. The only thing missing was Liam Neeson making an appearance to mentor him and give him purpose. Oh wait I forgot Russell Crowe filled that void when Clark made his way upon the spaceship.3. I feel Lois Lane was miscast, she did not have the feisty and strong personality of Margot Kidders Lois Lane or Erica Durance from Smallville who I personally feel would have done a much better job in the role. I also feel Tom Welling would have done an awesome job as Clark/Superman since he had done it for 10 years, and basically had the torch handed over to him from Christopher Reeve, but hey what does he know, he was just the only successful actor to portray Superman on the big screen and succeed. I don't want to knock Henry Cavill though he did a great job in the role.4. In the comics Krypton was shown and being more technically advanced, but also a beauty to behold. Krypton in the movie got the technical part right, but made the world a dark and ugly place. This is more an aesthetic opinion than a deal breaker for the film.My bottom line on this film is that if you never read the books you will probably love this movie and as a stand alone sci-fi action film it is a entertaining movie, if you are a purist like myself you will walk away from it, and hope one of these days Dc comics will get it right when it comes to these superhero films and stop Hollywood and their directors from trying to put their own stamp on the movies.",3,"GREAT ACTION MOVIE, BUT NOT TRUE TO SUPERMAN'S SENSE OF MORALITY, SPOILERS !!!!",1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,2654,"['movie', 'was', 'awesome', 'action', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'Laurence', 'Fishbourne', 'Perry', 'White', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'Clark', 'Kent/Superman', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Jorell', 'back', 'story', 'Krypton', 'was', 'also', 'enjoyable', 'So', 'how', 'great', 'things', 'did', 'feel', 'movie', 'missed', 'mark', 'being', 'greatest', 'Superman', 'movie', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'well', 'here', 'list', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'further', 'want', 'avoid', 'SPOILERS', ""'m"", 'doing', 'list', 'worst', 'decisions', 'made', 'movie', 'least', 'important.1', 'Superman/Clark', 'Kent', 'not', 'kill', 'heightened', 'sense', 'right', 'wrong', 'would', 'have', 'stopped', 'Zod', 'killing', 'Superman', 'Boyscout', 'would', 'not', 'cross', 'line', 'Batman', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'apt', 'kill', 'someone', 'greater', 'good', 'even', 'principle', 'killing', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'ruined', 'whole', 'film', 'personally.2', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'again', 'can', 'defiantly', 'tell', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'directed', 'film', 'took', 'story', 'ideas', 'Batman', 'begins', 'brought', 'directly', 'Man', 'Steel', 'where', 'comics', 'did', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'travel', 'fishing', 'ship', 'rugged', 'trying', 'find', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'was', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'making', 'appearance', 'mentor', 'give', 'purpose', 'Oh', 'wait', 'forgot', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'filled', 'void', 'when', 'Clark', 'made', 'way', 'spaceship.3', 'feel', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'was', 'miscast', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'feisty', 'strong', 'personality', 'Margot', 'Kidders', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'Smallville', 'who', 'personally', 'feel', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'role', 'also', 'feel', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'awesome', 'job', 'Clark/Superman', 'had', 'done', '10', 'years', 'basically', 'had', 'torch', 'handed', 'over', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'hey', 'what', 'know', 'was', 'just', 'only', 'successful', 'actor', 'portray', 'Superman', 'big', 'screen', 'succeed', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'knock', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'role.4', 'comics', 'Krypton', 'was', 'shown', 'being', 'more', 'technically', 'advanced', 'also', 'beauty', 'behold', 'Krypton', 'movie', 'got', 'technical', 'part', 'right', 'made', 'world', 'dark', 'ugly', 'place', 'more', 'aesthetic', 'opinion', 'deal', 'breaker', 'film.My', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'movie', 'stand', 'alone', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'film', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'are', 'purist', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'hope', 'one', 'days', 'Dc', 'comics', 'will', 'get', 'right', 'when', 'superhero', 'films', 'stop', 'Hollywood', 'directors', 'trying', 'put', 'own', 'stamp', 'movies']",N/A

It started feeling as if the entire last half of The Man of Steel was one very long extended fight scene with essentially the same tricks done over and over, most particularly where Superman and Mr. Bad Man throw each through building after building. This was among one of the several factors that nearly levels the entirety of dear old Gotham City, yet, by the end, everything is just perfectly back to normal. The offices of the Daily Planet are in pristine condition. No one has aged a day and, of course, no one even recognizes ol' Clark Kent in spite of the fact that every major player in all of the mayhem was deeply involved with the goings on involving Superman. It has always been a gripe of mine that the denizens of the Daily Planet were so unbelievably dense that they could not recognize Clark Kent as Superman in spite of all of their many observations of Superman. The only apt explanation it would seem is that, in addition to his X-Ray vision and super hearing and super strength and ability to fly and all of that, that Superman is somehow capable of manipulating the human mind to such a degree that he is able to selectively destroy all observational memory of this person. Perhaps he uses his super-ray eyes to fry that portion of the brain responsible for selective memory recall. That is just my theory.While The Man of Steel has a certain degree of entertainment value, it is also a story already told on film so many times that it seems completely redundant to visit it just one more time. The props and scripts change slightly each time, but it is essentially the same story. In addition, this version has more cuss words in it presumably to make it more ""real""; at least in the beginning, developmental stages coming primarily out of the mouth of a childhood bully. Just be warned in the event you have issues about letting your kids watch it and find certain language objectionable.The end really baffles me. Here Superman has just saved THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE from total destruction and now they have to depict this anal retentive army dude who is STILL suspicious that Superman just might turn against the good ol' USA. Now how stupid is that? No one would be alive, fer cryin' out loud. How logical is it then to have this stereotypical army dude STILL distrusting Superman? That just makes zero sense except as an excuse to have a sequel using this particular Superman. Oh well. One cannot expect to attempt to scratch the surface of any of these superhero action movies without the entire facade crumbling to dust. So be it.So would I recommend The Man of Steel? I suppose it's worth seeing it. It has some very impressive CG and special effects work in it, although it is often repetitive to the point of tedium. The acting is okay, although no one really truly stands out. All-in-all it's a oft-told tale with a lot of noise and explosions.

1562379,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B008JFUPFI,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[4, 12]","Of all the episodes of ""Adventures of Superman"", the best-remembered -- //the// best, in fact -- is ""Panic in the Sky"". It's the series' only true drama. In nearly every other episode, Superman simply steps in before the final Kellogg's commercial and fixes the problem. In ""Panic"", he's the one with the problem. No one can help, and he has to find the strength to face it alone. (The ""Lois & Clark"" remake is botched, completely missing this point.)If drama is defined as stories about plausible human emotions and conflicts, Superman is fundamentally anti-dramatic. He can't be hurt, can't be killed, and he can resolve almost any issue by the application of force (which is why the infamous Dr Wertham called him a fascist, ""giant the Jack-killer""). Unlike Batman, who's not only mortal, but a flawed human being, it's difficult to tell compelling stories about Superman. He's not only ""inhuman"", but has been raised by his Earth parents to believe he must observe the highest standards of morality, in order to be a model of ""niceness and goodness"" (as Maxwell Smart put it).Kryptonite (which was actually invented by Jerry Siegel in the rejected story ""The K-metal from Krypton"" -- you can find it on the Web) isn't a solution to this problem. By temporarily weakening Superman, kryptonite complicates the story, but doesn't prevent his ultimate resolution-by-force.Of the six preceding theatrical films (are you forgetting ""Mole Men""?), only S2 included real dramatic conflict -- Superman's decision to give up being Superman in exchange for human love and companionship. Of course, there's only one possible resolution -- especially if you want the franchise to continue.As John Steranko pointed out in his history of comic books, Batman first appeared in ""Detective Comics"", but Superman premiered in ""Action Comics"". Superman is not generally a cerebral or introspective person. * Batman translates easily to being a ""conflicted"" crime fighter. Superman does not.How much thought Christopher Nolan gave this when he decided to helm ""Man of Steel"" is not known. But the first of what one hopes will be a series of increasingly good films, suggests ""not much"". MoS is a loud, noisy film (though an exceptionally good one for that genre, which seems to be devouring American ""popular"" film making). Its principal failing -- as many critics have pointed out -- is that there are few moments of tenderness or wit. Contrast this with S1's scene of Clark leaving home and saying good-bye to his mother, accompanied by John Williams' uncharacteristically good music. One critic said it was one of the most-moving moments in all the films of 1978. There is nothing remotely comparable in MoS.David Goyer's script is, not surprisingly, much inferior to his ""Dark Knight"". (I haven't yet seen ""Rises"".) There are too few scenes of strong human interaction. (Why isn't there a heartfelt scene between Jor-El and his son?) Most of it simply drives along the plot. Given that S1 has so many memorable lines and iconic scenes, is this fair criticism? Yes. The rules of story structure and dramatic development are well-understood. A writer cannot ignore them, regardless of genre. Stories in which the principal conflict is physical are ultimately not very satisfying.Fortunately, most of the remaining negative criticism is wrong. The non-linear first half is no harder to follow than ""Citizen Kane"". The fight sequences at the end are well-paced and not overly long. (MoS is one of the subjectively shortest 143m films I've seen.) And though Michael Shannon is a flat villain (Terence Stamp made Zod his own, and Shannon doesn't seem the least concerned with finding something interesting about the character (though the script suggests a thing or two)), Kevin Costner rises from his usual torpor to deliver a creditable performance.How MoS is viewed in the long run will likely depend on where Nolan takes the stories. Without a grounding in characters with real emotions and real problems, Superman cannot fly.I have treatments for MoS3 and MoS4, which are real dramas. Care to see them, Mr Nolan?* One of the few ""good"" Silver Age stories, ""The Loneliest Man in the World"", has Clark at an apartment-house party, standing by himself and not talking with anyone, agonizing over how to help people with their problems (paying the rent, not having enough food, etc).",4,Disappointing -- but not the dog it's been painted.,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,4363,"['episodes', 'Adventures', 'Superman', 'best-remembered', '//the//', 'best', 'fact', 'Panic', 'Sky', 'series', 'only', 'true', 'drama', 'nearly', 'other', 'episode', 'Superman', 'simply', 'steps', 'final', 'Kellogg', 'commercial', 'problem', 'Panic', 'one', 'problem', 'one', 'can', 'help', 'find', 'strength', 'face', 'alone', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'remake', 'botched', 'completely', 'missing', 'point', 'drama', 'defined', 'stories', 'plausible', 'human', 'emotions', 'conflicts', 'Superman', 'fundamentally', 'anti-dramatic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'hurt', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'killed', 'can', 'resolve', 'almost', 'issue', 'application', 'force', 'why', 'infamous', 'Dr', 'Wertham', 'called', 'fascist', 'giant', 'Jack-killer', 'Batman', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'mortal', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'difficult', 'tell', 'compelling', 'stories', 'Superman', 'not', 'only', 'inhuman', 'been', 'raised', 'Earth', 'parents', 'believe', 'must', 'observe', 'highest', 'standards', 'morality', 'order', 'be', 'model', 'niceness', 'goodness', 'Maxwell', 'Smart', 'put', '.Kryptonite', 'was', 'actually', 'invented', 'Jerry', 'Siegel', 'rejected', 'story', 'K-metal', 'Krypton', 'can', 'find', 'Web', ""n't"", 'solution', 'problem', 'temporarily', 'weakening', 'Superman', 'kryptonite', 'story', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'ultimate', 'resolution-by-force.Of', 'six', 'preceding', 'theatrical', 'films', 'are', 'forgetting', 'Mole', 'Men', 'only', 'S2', 'included', 'real', 'dramatic', 'conflict', 'Superman', 'decision', 'give', 'up', 'being', 'Superman', 'exchange', 'human', 'love', 'companionship', 'course', 'only', 'one', 'possible', 'resolution', 'especially', 'want', 'franchise', 'continue.As', 'John', 'Steranko', 'pointed', 'out', 'history', 'comic', 'books', 'Batman', 'first', 'appeared', 'Detective', 'Comics', 'Superman', 'premiered', 'Action', 'Comics', 'Superman', 'not', 'generally', 'cerebral', 'introspective', 'person', '*', 'Batman', 'easily', 'being', 'conflicted', 'crime', 'fighter', 'Superman', 'not.How', 'much', 'thought', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'gave', 'when', 'decided', 'helm', 'Man', 'Steel', 'not', 'known', 'first', 'what', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'series', 'increasingly', 'good', 'films', 'not', 'much', 'MoS', 'loud', 'noisy', 'film', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'one', 'genre', 'be', 'devouring', 'American', 'popular', 'film', 'making', 'principal', 'failing', 'many', 'critics', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'tenderness', 'wit', 'Contrast', 'S1', 'scene', 'Clark', 'leaving', 'home', 'saying', 'good-bye', 'mother', 'accompanied', 'John', 'Williams', 'uncharacteristically', 'good', 'music', 'One', 'critic', 'said', 'was', 'one', 'most-moving', 'moments', 'films', '1978', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'comparable', 'MoS.David', 'Goyer', 'script', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'much', 'inferior', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'Rises', 'are', 'too', 'few', 'scenes', 'strong', 'human', 'interaction', 'Why', ""n't"", 'heartfelt', 'scene', 'Jor-El', 'son', 'Most', 'simply', 'plot', 'Given', 'S1', 'so', 'many', 'memorable', 'lines', 'iconic', 'scenes', 'fair', 'criticism', 'Yes', 'rules', 'story', 'structure', 'dramatic', 'development', 'are', 'well-understood', 'writer', 'can', 'not', 'ignore', 'regardless', 'genre', 'Stories', 'principal', 'conflict', 'physical', 'are', 'ultimately', 'not', 'very', 'satisfying.Fortunately', 'most', 'remaining', 'negative', 'criticism', 'wrong', 'non-linear', 'first', 'half', 'harder', 'follow', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'fight', 'sequences', 'end', 'are', 'well-paced', 'not', 'overly', 'long', 'MoS', 'one', 'subjectively', 'shortest', '143m', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'flat', 'villain', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'made', 'Zod', 'own', 'Shannon', ""n't"", 'seem', 'least', 'concerned', 'finding', 'something', 'interesting', 'character', 'script', 'thing', 'two', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'usual', 'torpor', 'deliver', 'creditable', 'performance.How', 'MoS', 'viewed', 'long', 'run', 'will', 'likely', 'depend', 'where', 'Nolan', 'stories', 'grounding', 'characters', 'real', 'emotions', 'real', 'problems', 'Superman', 'can', 'not', 'fly.I', 'have', 'treatments', 'MoS3', 'MoS4', 'are', 'real', 'dramas', 'Care', 'see', 'Mr', 'Nolan', '*', 'One', 'few', 'good', 'Silver', 'Age', 'stories', 'Loneliest', 'Man', 'World', 'Clark', 'apartment-house', 'party', 'standing', 'not', 'talking', 'anyone', 'agonizing', 'how', 'help', 'people', 'problems', 'paying', 'rent', 'not', 'having', 'enough', 'food', 'etc']",N/A

And, it's not afraid to shake up the myth a bit: Lois discovers his secret identity before he joins the Plant, nary a scrap of kryptonite to be seen (which would have been inconvenient with all that Kryptonian matter in the various spacecraft), and so on.Things fall pretty clearly into monochrome - evil Zod and crew, saintly JorEl and Ma and Pa Kent, Lois earnestly trying to Do The Right Thing, and the U.S. military in a flatly neutral shade of gray. The plot comes across as predictable, mostly: Invader wants Earth, irrespective of current residents, and Superman's kind of fond of Earth. (You know how that one comes out.) So, to make it watchable, they pile on the action and effects, both with very good effect.

So the bar wasn't exactly set high for me.

He's just Clark Kent, the well-manered alien with a  passive personality who is always restrained in his actions. Great person to be around in real life, not so great for the big-screen.

1562385,A3EVGPGOFVAP09,B008JFUPFI,"WorknMan ""worknman""","[10, 28]","Someone on IMDB said that those who read the Superman comics tend to like this film and those who don't are the ones who don't like it. I'd say that's very accurate in my case, as I've never read a comic in my life, and I don't care for this movie at all. I am much more a fan of the Reeve movies, which this has absolutely nothing in common with, making it much like the Star Trek series reboot.Some think that those of us who liked the older movies more just wanted a lot of camp in the new one. But for me, that couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, I hated the camp in the older movies. But the superman of old had a charisma about him that is completely missing here. In Superman (1978), we get a chance to get to know the character a little before the plot shifts into full gear.  In MoS, he puts on the cape, barely has time to learn how to fly, and then Zod shows up. From that point on (about halfway through), the movie basically becomes a non-interactive video game that pretty much doesn't stop until the end. You can tell that he's not yet comfortable in the suit, and the humans don't even know if he means to do them harm.When the fight between superman and the bad guys starts, you will see them get thrown about and plow right through buildings and completely rip up the streets until they finally skid to a halt. And I was actually impressed the first couple of times this happens. But after it happens a couple more dozen times, I found myself glancing at my watch, wondering when it was going to end, and getting a headache because the soundtrack is LOUD, and they had dragged it on entirely too long. There is a point where you can have too much of a good thing in this regard. (Oh, and of course you're going to see the military get involved, who are virtually useless.)Probably the most disturbing thing about it is all the destruction that happens as a result of these fights. You'd think superman would try to draw the fight away from the city in order to avoid as much loss of life as possible, but nope. This version of superman doesn't appear to care one way or the other.  Fans of MoS would say that 'this is the comic book version of superman, not the Reeve version.' Well, apparently then, the comic book superman is kind of a jerk with little regard for human life, whom I really don't care to root for. But the biggest problem is at the end, when he appears overly concerned with the fate of one family, we're supposed to feel his anguish over the decision he has to make, but the filmmakers apparently want us to forget that this comes right after the fight he just had with the villains probably killed thousands of people.In the end, if you went to see the Star Trek reboot in 2009 and ended up angry that you got Star Wars instead, you might have a similar reaction to this film. It isn't Star Wars, but it isn't Superman either. It's more like Independence Day.

The first half is a decent origin story for the hero, but the second half devolves into so much mindless action that I found myself bored despite all the ""exciting"" things going on. Say what you want about 2006's ""Superman Returns,"" but it didn't make this mistake. ""Superman Returns"" had great character development and was engrossing, and more so as the story progressed. ""Man of Steel"" is the exact opposite: The more the story progressed the more detached I became.""Man of Steel"" has a lot going for it. For one, the cast is superb. Henry Cavill is the best actor to play Superman yet, and Amy Adams (Lois), Michael Shannon (General Zod), Russell Crowe (Supe's dad) and Kevin Costner (Clark's stepdad) are all fine here, not to mention Zod's female assistant, played by Antje Traue, who steals the show!Like the original 1978 ""Superman"" with Christopher Reeve, the sci-fi in ""Man of Steel"" is stellar, only more so. Despite this, the first half's origin tale isn't as engrossing or entertaining as the first half of the '78 version. Still, it's not bad. Things go wrong in the second half, however, where one action scene is lumped on another with top-of-the-line F/X. It's similar to the Terminator films where two or more invincible inhumans pummel each other through walls and buildings, and humans shoot billions of ineffective rounds into them, except that the first three Terminator films keep your interest (especially the first two).FINAL WORD: So my feelings are mixed on ""Man of Steel."" In many ways it's great filmmaking, but they fumble the ball in the most important department -- an interesting story and characters you care about. They somewhat succeed in the first half, but the second half is an overload of ""exciting"" action scenes that quickly wear out their welcome and bore the viewer.The film runs 143 minutes but seems longer.GRADE: C+",3,"Decent, but overkill in the second half (i.e. boring)",1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,1994,"['curious', 'thing', 'movie', 'action', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'boring', 'Such', 'case', 'second', 'half', 'Man', 'Steel', 'first', 'half', 'decent', 'origin', 'story', 'hero', 'second', 'half', 'devolves', 'so', 'much', 'mindless', 'action', 'found', 'bored', 'exciting', 'things', 'going', 'Say', 'what', 'want', '2006', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'mistake', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'had', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'engrossing', 'more', 'so', 'story', 'progressed', 'Man', 'Steel', 'exact', 'opposite', 'more', 'story', 'progressed', 'more', 'detached', 'became', 'Man', 'Steel', 'lot', 'going', 'one', 'cast', 'superb', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'best', 'actor', 'play', 'Superman', 'yet', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Lois', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'General', 'Zod', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Supe', 'dad', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Clark', 'stepdad', 'are', 'fine', 'here', 'not', 'mention', 'Zod', 'female', 'assistant', 'played', 'Antje', 'Traue', 'who', 'show', 'original', '1978', 'Superman', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'sci-fi', 'Man', 'Steel', 'stellar', 'only', 'more', 'so', 'first', 'half', 'origin', 'tale', ""n't"", 'engrossing', 'entertaining', 'first', 'half', ""'78"", 'version', 'Still', 'not', 'bad', 'Things', 'go', 'wrong', 'second', 'half', 'however', 'where', 'one', 'action', 'scene', 'lumped', 'top-of-the-line', 'F/X', 'similar', 'Terminator', 'films', 'where', 'two', 'more', 'invincible', 'inhumans', 'pummel', 'other', 'walls', 'buildings', 'humans', 'shoot', 'billions', 'ineffective', 'rounds', 'first', 'three', 'Terminator', 'films', 'keep', 'interest', 'especially', 'first', 'two', '.FINAL', 'WORD', 'So', 'feelings', 'are', 'mixed', 'Man', 'Steel', 'many', 'ways', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'fumble', 'ball', 'most', 'important', 'department', 'interesting', 'story', 'characters', 'care', 'somewhat', 'succeed', 'first', 'half', 'second', 'half', 'overload', 'exciting', 'action', 'scenes', 'quickly', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'bore', 'viewer.The', 'film', '143', 'minutes', 'longer.GRADE', 'C+']",N/A

The penultimate issue of the original Miracleman storyline has become a collector's item for it's emotional and brutally graphic depiction of mayhem, murder and mass destruction enacted by the hero Miracleman and the series' villain, Kid Miracleman - a former child sidekick gone bad. The two are depicted as godlings, answerable to none but themselves suggesting that this is the realistic mindset of all super-powered heroes. It is this issue alone which appears to have served as the inspiration for the action depicted in ""Man Of Steel"" - anyone familiar with this comic book, Miracleman #15, would see that right away in ""Man Of Steel"". Fortunately for the film's creators the comic hasn't been reprinted since the late 1980s and is out of print and unaffordable for most.Even the movie's depiction of Superman's home planet of Krypton, filled to the brim with bizarrity, is an homage to the utterly strange alien technology that is the source of Miracleman's abilities. Alan Moore went out of his way in the comic's script to emphasize this strangeness which is manifested on film in ""Man Of Steel"" in it's own right, but owing much to the comic book.Then there is the clearly deliberate ommision of using ""Superman"" by name in what might be an attempt by the producers and writers to circumvent the impossibility of making a ""Miracleman"" film by substituting Superman under Warner Brothers/DC Comics very noses. ""The Man of Steel"" as played by Henry Cavill is fairly generic in his appearance and much has been done in the film to enrich the strange qualities and de-familiarize the audience with a character they think they know; even Lois Lane is a mellow and kind blonde and not the brick-eating jet-black haired/ivory skinned go-getter the public knows her as since her first comic book appearance in the late 1930s.To the film-maker's credit and fortunately for the audience, accustomed to cliche'd multi-angle slow-motion in almost every film depicting any sort of violent action for the last 15 years, the violence in the film is show in real-time ""super"" speed which makes it quite shocking and refreshing and certainly reflects the spirit of Miracleman the comic's imagery.Michael Shannon's ""General Zod"" character is a wonderfully horrifying re-imagining of Terence Stamp's original role in 1978's ""Superman"" and is the best part of the film, being  a more realistic villain in the spirit of ""The Dark Knight""'s Joker as played by the late Heath Ledger. Regarding ""Man Of Steel""s similarities with the ""Miracleman"" comic book, the results of Superman's epic battle with Zod are the most striking and blatantly lifted as is his final reaction and moral dilemma - but, no spoilers: you'll just have to see the film and take my word for it.If all this were not enough to convince anyone of the film's debt to Moore's comic, consider that Snyder's last comic book oriented film was Alan Moore's OTHER creepy ode to superherodom: ""The Watchmen"".Over-all, ""Man of Steel"" is entertaining without being the definitive Superman film it might have been, leaving that laurel still firmly atop the heads of the late Christopher Reeve and director Richard Donner, and deserves to be seen on the big screen - in 3D even. Though not actually a film depicting ""Miracleman"" by any stretch, it has enough of the that series' ""geist"" behind its most apparent qualities to remind those familiar with the Alan Moore's comic opus of Miracleman on nearly evey level.",3,"Oops!

1562394,A24JDJQWQDDH14,B008JFUPFI,Yu Narukami,"[1, 2]","Everyone knows the Superman story, it's one that's seemingly burned into the subconscious from birth. So clearly and definitively rendered was this comic tale in Christopher Reeve's 1978 blockbuster that the last filmmaker to tackle the character (X-Men's Bryan Singer) lifted its iconography wholesale for 2006 misfire Superman Returns.That film was hamstrung by nostalgia and left audiences nonplussed, so the latest big-screen version is understandably a clean break from the past with Dark Knight duo Christopher Nolan and David S Goyer hatching a story to re-invent DC Comics' flagship hero.Man of Steel begins on Krypton as Lara (Ayelet Zurer) and Jor-El (Russell Crowe) welcome the planet's first natural birth in centuries. Their people, once ambitious intergalactic explorers, genetically engineer newborns to serve in pre-determined roles. With the planet's natural resources exhausted and Krypton in its final days, Jor-El rockets his son to safety as military leader General Zod (Michael Shannon) stages a last-minute coup with designs on purifying the race and starting over. He's banished to the Phantom Zone, but only after vowing to find Kal-El.Director Zack Snyder then makes a daring cut from Kal's plummeting rocket to a fishing trawler carrying a bearded Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), wandering the globe looking to help those in need. In a neat structural trick similar to the one employed in Batman Begins, we flash back to see a younger Clark struggling through adolescence due to his nascent superpowers. In the present day, a spaceship buried deep in the Arctic Circle points Clark in the direction of his destiny, while also putting him on a collision course with a Zod hellbent on resurrecting his obliterated homeworld.Whereas previous films have used Lois Lane (here gamely played by Amy Adams) as a key emotional crutch for Superman, here the emphasis is on fathers and sons, the push-pull between Kryptonian and human heritage and Clark's desire for belonging and acceptance.Screenwriter Goyer cleverly plays out this thematic thread between Clark, the Kents and Jor-El ('alive' as an echo of his preserved consciousness), while also keeping it a key component to Zod's masterplan (and thus a way to conjure up jaw-dropping spectacle).Snyder's instincts as an action director quickly come to the fore as he marshals skirmishes on Krypton, a huge-scale battle in Smallville and a Metropolis smack-about that sends Superman and Zod careening through skyscrapers. With the latest digital tools at its disposal, Man of Steel is easily the most exhilarating and arresting interpretation of Superman yet. When Cavill's predecessors took flight it all seemed so leisurely. Here, his lift-offs are positively supersonic.The Brit actor cuts an impressive figure both in and out of the red and blue. He tackles the role without a trace of irony,meaning he's in keeping with the straight-arrow seriousness of the film but perhaps lacking the immediate charm of Reeve's Superman. When it comes to sheer physicality, though, he's far more dynamic and intimidating than any of his predecessors. Snyder and co have gone to great lengths to ditch the boy scout label.Man of Steel's supporting players, a veritable who's who of A-list talent, are all excellent in their limited screen time. Daily Planet chief Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) acts as a nice counterweight to Lois's early eagerness to expose Clark's anonymous do-goodery, while Shannon is chilling in his dogged commitment to duty.Costner and Crowe both crucially find emotional poignancy as the guiding lights who help Clark on his way to greatness. They're helped in part by a great score by Hans Zimmer, who hits upon a motif that can be tinkled quietly on the piano or blasted out by an orchestra.Impressive as all this is, Man of Steel is not quite the perfect movie. Snyder's deployment of handheld camerawork works to create an intimacy between viewer and action, but this aesthetic jars horrendously with the 3D conversion (see in 2D if you can). Character loses focus in favor of action in the final third and there are also shades of Clark's character that go unexplored (for instance his split identity and deeper relationship with Lois). These threads are left tantalisingly open for a sequel, though. The foundations are firmly in place for what could be exciting further adventures of Superman.",4,Man of steel is here!,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,4385,"['Everyone', 'Superman', 'story', 'one', 'seemingly', 'burned', 'subconscious', 'birth', 'clearly', 'definitively', 'rendered', 'was', 'comic', 'tale', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', '1978', 'blockbuster', 'last', 'filmmaker', 'tackle', 'character', 'X-Men', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'lifted', 'iconography', 'wholesale', '2006', 'misfire', 'Superman', 'Returns.That', 'film', 'was', 'hamstrung', 'nostalgia', 'left', 'audiences', 'nonplussed', 'latest', 'big-screen', 'version', 'understandably', 'clean', 'break', 'past', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'duo', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'David', 'S', 'Goyer', 'hatching', 'story', 're-invent', 'DC', 'Comics', 'flagship', 'hero.Man', 'Steel', 'begins', 'Krypton', 'Lara', 'Ayelet', 'Zurer', 'Jor-El', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'welcome', 'planet', 'first', 'natural', 'birth', 'centuries', 'people', 'once', 'ambitious', 'intergalactic', 'explorers', 'genetically', 'newborns', 'serve', 'pre-determined', 'roles', 'planet', 'natural', 'resources', 'exhausted', 'Krypton', 'final', 'days', 'Jor-El', 'rockets', 'son', 'safety', 'military', 'leader', 'General', 'Zod', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'last-minute', 'coup', 'designs', 'purifying', 'race', 'starting', 'over', 'banished', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'only', 'vowing', 'find', 'Kal-El.Director', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'then', 'daring', 'cut', 'Kal', 'plummeting', 'rocket', 'fishing', 'trawler', 'carrying', 'bearded', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'wandering', 'globe', 'looking', 'help', 'need', 'neat', 'structural', 'trick', 'similar', 'one', 'employed', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'flash', 'back', 'see', 'younger', 'Clark', 'struggling', 'adolescence', 'due', 'nascent', 'superpowers', 'present', 'day', 'spaceship', 'buried', 'deep', 'Arctic', 'Circle', 'points', 'Clark', 'direction', 'destiny', 'also', 'putting', 'collision', 'course', 'Zod', 'hellbent', 'resurrecting', 'obliterated', 'homeworld.Whereas', 'previous', 'films', 'have', 'used', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'here', 'gamely', 'played', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'key', 'emotional', 'crutch', 'Superman', 'here', 'emphasis', 'fathers', 'sons', 'push-pull', 'Kryptonian', 'human', 'heritage', 'Clark', 'desire', 'belonging', 'acceptance.Screenwriter', 'Goyer', 'cleverly', 'out', 'thematic', 'thread', 'Clark', 'Kents', 'Jor-El', ""'alive"", 'echo', 'preserved', 'consciousness', 'also', 'keeping', 'key', 'component', 'Zod', 'masterplan', 'thus', 'way', 'conjure', 'up', 'jaw-dropping', 'spectacle', '.Snyder', 'instincts', 'action', 'director', 'quickly', 'come', 'fore', 'skirmishes', 'Krypton', 'huge-scale', 'battle', 'Smallville', 'Metropolis', 'smack-about', 'Superman', 'Zod', 'careening', 'skyscrapers', 'latest', 'digital', 'tools', 'disposal', 'Man', 'Steel', 'easily', 'most', 'exhilarating', 'arresting', 'interpretation', 'Superman', 'yet', 'When', 'Cavill', 'predecessors', 'took', 'flight', 'seemed', 'so', 'leisurely', 'Here', 'lift-offs', 'are', 'positively', 'supersonic.The', 'Brit', 'actor', 'cuts', 'impressive', 'figure', 'red', 'blue', 'role', 'trace', 'irony', 'meaning', 'keeping', 'straight-arrow', 'seriousness', 'film', 'perhaps', 'lacking', 'immediate', 'charm', 'Reeve', 'Superman', 'When', 'sheer', 'physicality', 'though', 'far', 'more', 'dynamic', 'intimidating', 'predecessors', 'Snyder', 'co', 'have', 'gone', 'great', 'lengths', 'ditch', 'boy', 'scout', 'label.Man', 'Steel', 'supporting', 'players', 'veritable', 'who', 'who', 'A-list', 'talent', 'are', 'excellent', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'chief', 'Perry', 'White', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'nice', 'counterweight', 'Lois', 'early', 'eagerness', 'expose', 'Clark', 'anonymous', 'do-goodery', 'Shannon', 'chilling', 'dogged', 'commitment', 'duty.Costner', 'Crowe', 'crucially', 'find', 'emotional', 'poignancy', 'guiding', 'lights', 'who', 'help', 'Clark', 'way', 'greatness', ""'re"", 'helped', 'part', 'great', 'score', 'Hans', 'Zimmer', 'who', 'motif', 'can', 'be', 'tinkled', 'quietly', 'piano', 'blasted', 'out', 'orchestra.Impressive', 'Man', 'Steel', 'not', 'quite', 'perfect', 'movie', 'Snyder', 'deployment', 'handheld', 'camerawork', 'create', 'intimacy', 'viewer', 'action', 'aesthetic', 'jars', 'horrendously', '3D', 'conversion', 'see', '2D', 'can', 'Character', 'focus', 'favor', 'action', 'final', 'third', 'are', 'also', 'shades', 'Clark', 'character', 'go', 'unexplored', 'instance', 'split', 'identity', 'deeper', 'relationship', 'Lois', 'threads', 'are', 'left', 'tantalisingly', 'open', 'sequel', 'though', 'foundations', 'are', 'firmly', 'place', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'exciting', 'further', 'adventures', 'Superman']",N/A
1562395,AP3B615GM191G,B008JFUPFI,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[6, 17]","Though few and far between, there are movies (or movie franchises) that absolutely repel the notion of being re-made or re-imagined.  For instance, it would be asinine to remake Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (e.g. they are now the definitive version that will stand the test of time).  Or, imagine the heresy in trying to recreate the ""Back To The Future"" series.  Those same problems are part of the reason why ""Man of Steel"" will not fully take flight.  It just so happens that the 1970s Christopher Reeve version of the character might never be improved upon.  It is just tough for movie-goers to believe this notion regarding a movie made in the 70s.For a basic plot summary, ""Man of Steel"" basically uses the familiar story (from ""Superman II"") of Superman's (Henry Cavill) battle with General Zod (Michael Shannon) of Krypton.  The film serves as yet another origin story (though this time with many key differences from traditional canon) with Clark Kent interacting with human father Jonathan (Kevin Costner), human mother Martha (Diane Lane), Lois Lane (Amy Adams), and Kryptonian father Jor-El (Russell Crowe).In analyzing why this movie will be viewed as somewhat of a failure (despite not being all that terrible standing on its own) I will now have to use some spoilers.  You have been warned.The trouble with ""Man of Steel"" is primarily two-fold:First, this is not as ""deep"" of a movie as what was expected (or what we were lead to believe in the trailer).  Despite my sincere hope that Christopher Nolan could pull off a ""dark, gritty Superman"" character like he did with his ""Batman"" trilogy, it just doesn't work.  One can easily liken this film to ""Batman Begins"", except whereas ""Begins"" felt so natural to the Batman character, ""Man of Steel"" feels forced.Secondly, most of the changes made to the Superman canon of previous material are changes for the worse.  For example (here come some spoilers...)-Clark letting father Jonathan die in a Kansas twister so as not to reveal his powers-Lois meeting Clark very early on in the narrative and discovering his true identity-The look and feel of Krypton (dark and gloomy)-Transformers-esque fight scenes that stimulate all senses but the mind/emotions.Now, granted, this film did enough things right to be decent. The character of Zod is given (in true Nolan ""develop the villain as much as the hero fashion"") a much better backstory in this installment than any previous.  It is fascinating to contemplate the notion of why exactly he is so ruthless and bent on restoring Krypton.  Also, the acting is pretty solid as well.  Even lacking great script material to work with, all the principles perform solidly.When it comes right down to it, though, ""Man of Steel"" might be the ""proof in the pudding"" that Superman's definitive version was created by Richard Donner and Christopher Reeve in the 1970s.  In ""Superman Returns"", Bryan Singer had a great kernel of an ideal (""Superman returns to a world in need of him"") but couldn't correctly navigate the logistics to pull of even a decent film.  In ""Man of Steel"", Nolan gets the procedural stuff right but completely loses the heart of the story in the process.I wanted very much to like this movie but after viewing left the theater mostly disappointed.  Had this been the first version of Superman ever created for the big screen (or if this is the first Superman movie you've ever seen) it will probably be decent for you.  However, as a big fan of all things ""Supes"", my exact ranking would be 2.5 stars, barely clocking it ahead of ""Superman Returns"" (a sad statement indeed considering my expectations for the experience).",3,Hardly Improves Upon Anything,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,3659,"['few', 'far', 'are', 'movies', 'movie', 'franchises', 'absolutely', 'repel', 'notion', 'being', 're-made', 're-imagined', 'instance', 'would', 'be', 'asinine', 'remake', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'e.g', 'are', 'now', 'definitive', 'version', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'imagine', 'heresy', 'trying', 'recreate', 'Back', 'Future', 'series', 'same', 'problems', 'are', 'part', 'reason', 'why', 'Man', 'Steel', 'will', 'not', 'fully', 'take', 'flight', 'just', 'so', '1970s', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'version', 'character', 'might', 'never', 'be', 'improved', 'just', 'tough', 'movie-goers', 'believe', 'notion', 'regarding', 'movie', 'made', '70s.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Man', 'Steel', 'basically', 'familiar', 'story', 'Superman', 'II', 'Superman', 'Henry', 'Cavill', 'battle', 'General', 'Zod', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'Krypton', 'film', 'as', 'yet', 'origin', 'story', 'time', 'many', 'key', 'differences', 'traditional', 'canon', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'interacting', 'human', 'father', 'Jonathan', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'human', 'mother', 'Martha', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Kryptonian', 'father', 'Jor-El', 'Russell', 'Crowe', '.In', 'analyzing', 'why', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'viewed', 'somewhat', 'failure', 'not', 'being', 'terrible', 'standing', 'own', 'will', 'now', 'have', 'use', 'spoilers', 'have', 'been', 'warned.The', 'trouble', 'Man', 'Steel', 'primarily', 'two-fold', 'First', 'not', 'deep', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'expected', 'what', 'were', 'lead', 'believe', 'trailer', 'sincere', 'hope', 'Christopher', 'Nolan', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'dark', 'gritty', 'Superman', 'character', 'did', 'Batman', 'trilogy', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'One', 'can', 'easily', 'liken', 'film', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Begins', 'felt', 'so', 'natural', 'Batman', 'character', 'Man', 'Steel', 'feels', 'forced.Secondly', 'most', 'changes', 'made', 'Superman', 'canon', 'previous', 'material', 'are', 'changes', 'worse', 'example', 'here', 'come', 'spoilers', '-Clark', 'letting', 'father', 'Jonathan', 'die', 'Kansas', 'twister', 'so', 'not', 'reveal', 'powers-Lois', 'meeting', 'Clark', 'very', 'early', 'narrative', 'discovering', 'true', 'identity-The', 'look', 'feel', 'Krypton', 'dark', 'gloomy', '-Transformers-esque', 'fight', 'scenes', 'stimulate', 'senses', 'mind/emotions.Now', 'granted', 'film', 'did', 'enough', 'things', 'right', 'be', 'decent', 'character', 'Zod', 'given', 'true', 'Nolan', 'develop', 'villain', 'as', 'much', 'hero', 'fashion', 'much', 'better', 'backstory', 'installment', 'previous', 'fascinating', 'contemplate', 'notion', 'why', 'exactly', 'so', 'ruthless', 'bent', 'restoring', 'Krypton', 'Also', 'acting', 'pretty', 'solid', 'as', 'well', 'Even', 'lacking', 'great', 'script', 'material', 'work', 'principles', 'perform', 'solidly.When', 'right', 'down', 'though', 'Man', 'Steel', 'might', 'be', 'proof', 'pudding', 'Superman', 'definitive', 'version', 'was', 'created', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', '1970s', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'had', 'great', 'kernel', 'ideal', 'Superman', 'world', 'need', 'could', ""n't"", 'correctly', 'navigate', 'logistics', 'pull', 'even', 'decent', 'film', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Nolan', 'procedural', 'stuff', 'right', 'completely', 'heart', 'story', 'process.I', 'wanted', 'very', 'much', 'like', 'movie', 'viewing', 'left', 'theater', 'mostly', 'disappointed', 'Had', 'been', 'first', 'version', 'Superman', 'ever', 'created', 'big', 'screen', 'first', 'Superman', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'decent', 'However', 'big', 'fan', 'things', 'Supes', 'exact', 'ranking', 'would', 'be', '2.5', 'stars', 'barely', 'clocking', 'ahead', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'sad', 'statement', 'indeed', 'considering', 'expectations', 'experience']",N/A
1562396,A1S1BJFTA644TU,B008JFUPFI,Zalmorion the Fantastic,"[3, 6]","Wow . . . I am not a Superman fan, but this movie interested me.  I am GLAD I tried it.The action is intense and of the kind that makes you want to re-watch scenes over and over.  Great fights.  Great explosions.  Science fiction aspects that are truly different.  From the ships to the creatures to the architecture to the suits--all very cool.  The effects are grand and incredible.The acting is superb.  Cavill becomes Superman.  I am genuinely impressed.  There is no other Superman now.  He is the best.  Never expected that.  Most of all--because I have always hated Lois Lane--I actually liked Lois Lane's character for the first time ever! Amy Adams (and the writing) makes her likable, interesting, and admirable.  Zod and his right hand woman Faora are excellent villains fighting for a cause we can relate to.  They are unpredictable, believable, and never melodramatic.  The Kents are brought to life like never before.  They are not props or background pieces.  They are legitimate inspirations--superheroes in their own way.Only the story and characterization lack--no fault of the writers, though.  The movie just is not long enough to address all of the questions, quirks, and revelations that would make this story perfect.  The film can only touch upon what makes each character tick, what made Krypton and its people unique, and the science behind Superman.  So that is a weakness.  Also, who the heck was that giant and why wasn't he characterized!?!  Wow.They do not explain how and why Superman gets weak near the ""atmospheric conditions"" of Krypton.  That seems like a pretty stupid thing to neglect.  They would have been better off using the standard Kryptonite and applying plausible scientific explanations.The big surprise?  Jor-El is an incredible hero.  His scenes are probably the among the very best in the film.  Crowe is incredible.  The action is incredible.  His downloaded consciousness is fun and entertaining and very helpful.  Basically, Jor-El goes from being a hero like Batman to a heroic mentor figure who is a combination of Tony Stark's Jarvis and Obi-Wan Kenobi!
