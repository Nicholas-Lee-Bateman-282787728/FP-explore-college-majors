The second episode tells how Kamui's mother died and what she told him to do, the second divine sword is born in this episode. The third episode is a milestone episode. Kamui finally picks a side!!! And Fuma awakens as the other Kamui. I'm not going to tell which side he picked. The ending of this volume is rather sad, someone is killed by a Dragon of Earth. I love this volume, check it out.",5,X Volume 4 Review,1058227200,"07 15, 2003",2003,536,"['first', 'episode', 'kind', 'dull', 'Yuzuriha', 'childhood', 'invisible', 'spirit', 'dog', 'Inuki', 'other', 'two', 'make', 'up', 'second', 'episode', 'how', 'Kamui', 'mother', 'died', 'what', 'told', 'do', 'second', 'divine', 'sword', 'born', 'episode', 'third', 'episode', 'milestone', 'episode', 'Kamui', 'finally', 'side', 'Fuma', 'other', 'Kamui', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'side', 'picked', 'ending', 'volume', 'rather', 'sad', 'someone', 'killed', 'Dragon', 'Earth', 'love', 'volume', 'check', 'out']",X: Four - Volume 4

Being the only one who can see her spirit dog, the others in her age group have always looked at her as a weirdo. She begins to have strong feelings for Kusanagi, though she doesn't know that he's the enemy. Kamui also makes an important decision. When he does the divine sword appears; but at a terrible cost.This is an excellent series. It has action, drama, and suspense. The animation, plot, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent. There are also lots of great characters and plot twists. I try to be objective and think of just 1 bad thing to say about this series, but I can't. This is an all around incredible story. CLAMP has done it again! This is a must see for every anime fan.",5,A tragic event,1355184000,"12 11, 2012",2012,729,"['Yuzuriha', 'past', 'been', 'lonely', 'Being', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'spirit', 'dog', 'others', 'age', 'group', 'have', 'always', 'looked', 'weirdo', 'have', 'strong', 'feelings', 'Kusanagi', ""n't"", 'know', 'enemy', 'Kamui', 'also', 'important', 'decision', 'When', 'divine', 'sword', 'terrible', 'cost.This', 'excellent', 'series', 'action', 'drama', 'suspense', 'animation', 'plot', 'voice', 'acting', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'excellent', 'are', 'also', 'lots', 'great', 'characters', 'plot', 'twists', 'try', 'be', 'objective', 'think', 'just', '1', 'bad', 'thing', 'say', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'incredible', 'story', 'CLAMP', 'done', 'again', 'must', 'see', 'anime', 'fan']",X: Four - Volume 4
738172,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B00008DDFT,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[9, 9]","One of interesting episodes that will no doubt get lost amongst the more dramatic episodes is 'Inuki.'  This is Yuzuriha Nekoi's story.  As a child, this Dragon of Heaven acquired an invisible friend a puppy named Inuki, whose duty was to protect her.  It always hurt her that no one else could see Inuki.  The delight of her coming to Tokyo was discovering that the other Dragons could see the dog.  Especially Kusanagi Shiyu, one of the few sympathetic Dragons of Earth.The remaining two episodes delineate the crisis point of this series - Kamui's decision.  The interactions between Kamui, Kotori, and Fuma are lovingly detailed, as the second Shinken makes its appearance and the inexorable mid-point is reached.  These are terrible events whose repercussions drive the remainder of the series.  The viewer will have to forgive me for being as mysterious as possible.One of the things worth musing on at this point is how negatively the Dragons of Earth are painted.  In reality, they represent the divine urge to sweep all away and start over, while the Dragons of Heaven speak for the need to care and preserve.  Shiva and Vishnu, ever in conflict, but both needed.  As such, I am surprised that they are very nearly cast as the villains.  Regardless of the final resolution of the series, neither side represents evil, nor should either be allowed to rule on its own.  It will be interesting to see how Yoshiaki Kawajiri brings this to closure.In any case, this continues to be a brilliant, disquieting series that speaks with both metaphor and action.  This effort is amazingly superior to the jagged presentation of the film.  And continually lives up to its artistic promise.  I'm glad the decision was made to create this reinterpretation.  Of course, by now, you have discovered the same thing yourself.",5,The Choice...

And certainly alter the future of the world.X, up to this point has been beautiful and surreal. The episodes on this DVD change the mood of the show.
