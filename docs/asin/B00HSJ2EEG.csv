1691923,A1NASOLPXWNPYQ,B00HSJ2EEG,A Reader,"[0, 0]","My rating is a 3.5.  The movie was too convoluted for its own good.  However, it is an interesting, suspenseful film. Plausible premise on the buying and selling thus upsetting of world markets. My question is the story  based on something that was reported in the papers in years gone by?  With the 1st viewing I had a hard time keeping up with the names, and code names of the principle parties.  The 2nd viewing made it all clear.  Believable chemistry between De France and Dujardin.  A bit of a stretch accepting Tom Roth as a Russian, yet, he is a good actor.",3,Overall a good film,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,565,"['rating', '3.5', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'convoluted', 'own', 'good', 'However', 'interesting', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'Plausible', 'premise', 'buying', 'selling', 'thus', 'upsetting', 'world', 'markets', 'question', 'story', 'based', 'something', 'was', 'reported', 'papers', 'years', 'gone', '1st', 'viewing', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'keeping', 'up', 'names', 'code', 'names', 'principle', 'parties', '2nd', 'viewing', 'made', 'clear', 'Believable', 'chemistry', 'De', 'France', 'Dujardin', 'A', 'bit', 'stretch', 'accepting', 'Tom', 'Roth', 'Russian', 'yet', 'good', 'actor']",Mobius

Stayed for the international espionage, double and triple agents and the overwhelming passion of a man and woman for each other.  This is a quiet film.  Not one explosion, no car crashes and not one drop of blood.  A spectacular sex scene with not one scream and no nudity.  Never would have guessed the ending and it brought a tear to the eye.A truly twisting story with nary a clich&eacute;, only the most essential of dialogue with no filler, no waste and very intimate direction.

Unfortunately, he didn't understand Hitchcock's brilliance as a meticulously focused storyteller. This movie's ludicrously convoluted and rambling tale of money-laundering, corruption among international oligarchs, and two secret agents falling for one another is brilliant only in the director's imagination.

When a powerful Russian finds her and forces her to help him she meets Mose (Dujardin), a Russian operative. Her and Mose strike up a fast relationship both trying to hide who they really are from each other, but you can only hide the truth for so long. This is a hard movie to review, mainly because the plot was a little hard to follow, for me at least. It was really just a movie about a type of espionage triangle and you begin to question everyone's motives. It was pretty slow moving and went back and forth between french and english so if you aren't a big foreign movie fan that is your warning. This is a movie for a select group of people. For me it was a little too slow and predictable for me to fully get into. Overall, nothing that I would rush and see or see again. I give this a C+.",3,This is a movie for a select group of people.
