160399,A3UWYCISNFHO2X,0800102150,albarino,"[0, 3]","After the 1960s, American historians turned their attention to the African American experience and found buried and previously unknown information. Among the more revelatory finds was the participation of blacks in combat units in the final years of the Civil War. (The Civil War centennial was also a contributory factor, as later was the Roots TV series.)As this information became better known, Hollywood screenwriters became interested in new story angles, and studio executives in new markets. Thus ""Glory"" made it to the screen. It had much going for it:  a strong cast of African American lead actors to tell the story of the first black combat regiment in the war. It is a fairly well-polished film, though it retains too many conventions to make it significant. I've seen it three times, and still find it a cut above the usual Civil War film, and far ahead of the awkward and clumsy ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"". In capturing the atmosphere and look of the 1860s (set & scenic design and costumes), ""Glory"" excels. It also has a moving choral soundtrack.However, one of the biggest challenges facing writers, directors and actors dealing with historical material is how to get a blend of accurate history and contemporary audience interest combined into a compelling film. Here and there, ""Glory"" manages to break through on these counts, but in the end it relies to heavily on conventions.Among the first conventions was the stagey lionizing of the abolitionist writer, Frederick Douglass, who dramatically turns from a looking out a window to fix with a magisterial gaze on a still shell-shocked Captain Robert Gould Shaw. For me, this made Douglass into a virtual  Olympian deity, not a flesh-and-blood human being. Actor Matthew Broderick's Shaw is an all too-restrained character and we really never get a sense of the man inside. He is ever dutiful and little else.The African American soldiers rise above the types the writers have created, largely through fine characterizations: Denzel Washington's incandescent cynicism and realpolitik about race and America AFTER the fighting stops. And here ""Glory"" pulls no punches. Morgan Freeman does his usual dignified, paternal African American turn, and Andre Brougher is a real surprise as a freeman -  a relatively privileged and educated northern African American struggling to master common soldiering.One of my favorite scenes is the tension between a Southern-hating, abolitionist Union officer (actually, a Kansas guerrilla commanding undisciplined liberated slaves that he holds in contempt) and Col Shaw, by contrast, who wants to put his very disciplined troops into real military action - not looting and destroying towns and farms in South Carolina. The former is a vindictive cynic; Shaw is a firm believer in the martial ethos AND the capacities of his troops, and above all, the righteousness of the Union cause.The battle scenes are a mix of realism and theatrics, and are more or less successful. But then Steven Speilberg's harrowing D-Day invasion in ""Saving Private Ryan"" has become the gold standard of the chaos and destruction of combat. ""Glory"" seems tepid by comparison, although the opening scenes in a military field hospital are sobering.All in all, if there is one Civil War film I would recommend as the first to view, ""Glory"" is my choice. One hopes that future directors and writers will more deeply engage with this crucial era in American history and its impact on the people who fought or lived through the Civil War.",3,A respectable effort: 3 1/2 stars,1315872000,"09 13, 2011",2011,3523,"['1960s', 'American', 'historians', 'turned', 'attention', 'African', 'American', 'experience', 'found', 'buried', 'previously', 'unknown', 'information', 'more', 'revelatory', 'finds', 'was', 'participation', 'blacks', 'combat', 'units', 'final', 'years', 'Civil', 'War', 'Civil', 'War', 'centennial', 'was', 'also', 'contributory', 'factor', 'later', 'was', 'Roots', 'TV', 'series', 'information', 'became', 'better', 'known', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriters', 'became', 'interested', 'new', 'story', 'angles', 'studio', 'executives', 'new', 'markets', 'Thus', 'Glory', 'made', 'screen', 'had', 'much', 'going', 'strong', 'cast', 'African', 'American', 'lead', 'actors', 'tell', 'story', 'first', 'black', 'combat', 'regiment', 'war', 'fairly', 'well-polished', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'conventions', 'make', 'significant', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'three', 'times', 'still', 'find', 'cut', 'usual', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'far', 'ahead', 'awkward', 'clumsy', 'Gettysburg', 'Gods', 'Generals', 'capturing', 'atmosphere', 'look', '1860s', 'set', 'scenic', 'design', 'costumes', 'Glory', 'excels', 'also', 'moving', 'choral', 'soundtrack.However', 'one', 'biggest', 'challenges', 'facing', 'writers', 'directors', 'actors', 'dealing', 'historical', 'material', 'how', 'get', 'blend', 'accurate', 'history', 'contemporary', 'audience', 'interest', 'combined', 'compelling', 'film', 'Here', 'there', 'Glory', 'manages', 'break', 'counts', 'end', 'heavily', 'conventions.Among', 'first', 'conventions', 'was', 'stagey', 'lionizing', 'abolitionist', 'writer', 'Frederick', 'Douglass', 'who', 'dramatically', 'looking', 'out', 'window', 'fix', 'magisterial', 'gaze', 'still', 'shell-shocked', 'Captain', 'Robert', 'Gould', 'Shaw', 'made', 'Douglass', 'virtual', 'Olympian', 'deity', 'not', 'flesh-and-blood', 'human', 'being', 'Actor', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Shaw', 'too-restrained', 'character', 'really', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'man', 'inside', 'ever', 'dutiful', 'little', 'else.The', 'African', 'American', 'soldiers', 'rise', 'types', 'writers', 'have', 'created', 'largely', 'fine', 'characterizations', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'incandescent', 'cynicism', 'realpolitik', 'race', 'America', 'AFTER', 'fighting', 'stops', 'here', 'Glory', 'punches', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'usual', 'dignified', 'paternal', 'African', 'American', 'turn', 'Andre', 'Brougher', 'real', 'surprise', 'freeman', 'relatively', 'privileged', 'educated', 'northern', 'African', 'American', 'struggling', 'master', 'common', 'soldiering.One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'tension', 'Southern-hating', 'abolitionist', 'Union', 'officer', 'actually', 'Kansas', 'guerrilla', 'commanding', 'undisciplined', 'liberated', 'slaves', 'contempt', 'Col', 'Shaw', 'contrast', 'who', 'put', 'very', 'disciplined', 'troops', 'real', 'military', 'action', 'not', 'looting', 'destroying', 'towns', 'farms', 'South', 'Carolina', 'former', 'vindictive', 'cynic', 'Shaw', 'firm', 'believer', 'martial', 'ethos', 'capacities', 'troops', 'righteousness', 'Union', 'cause.The', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'mix', 'realism', 'theatrics', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'successful', 'then', 'Steven', 'Speilberg', 'harrowing', 'D-Day', 'invasion', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'become', 'gold', 'standard', 'chaos', 'destruction', 'combat', 'Glory', 'tepid', 'comparison', 'opening', 'scenes', 'military', 'field', 'hospital', 'are', 'sobering.All', 'one', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'first', 'view', 'Glory', 'choice', 'One', 'future', 'directors', 'writers', 'will', 'more', 'deeply', 'engage', 'crucial', 'era', 'American', 'history', 'impact', 'people', 'who', 'fought', 'lived', 'Civil', 'War']",N/A
160400,AGEIT17HENDIS,0800102150,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 1]","Over the past several years that this space has existed I have touted the heroic experiences of the American Civil War pro-Union black volunteer regiment, the Massachusetts 54th Infantry many times. Recently in preparing materials for this space to be posted in honor of Black History Month I noticed that I had not reviewed the subject of this entry, the Oscar-winning film ""Glory"". I make amends here.This fictionalized version of the creation of an all black volunteer regiment (at least in the ranks) hews pretty closely to the actual events in that process, taking into account the inevitable dramatizations required by the ""laws"" of cinematic license. And that fact is important. In other commentary on the history of the 54th, and in previous recollections of my own personal history of ""discovery"" of the regiment I have noted that in my high school years in the 1960s no mention was ever made of the exploits of this hardy band of soldiers fighting for their freedom and the preservation of the American union. None. And that, my friends, was here in Massachusetts the home of the regiment and of the famous, if then obscure, Saint-Gaudens memorial plague to the regiment that in front of the State House that, at one point in my life I passed every day.Lincoln and other Northern war leaders hesitated to create all black regiments for a number of reasons despite the need for man power on the battlefield as the war drew out inconclusively for a long period. Those reasons did not include the fact that the likes of the revolutionary black abolitionist Frederick were clamoring for black soldiers not only to preserve the union but to actively gain their own freedom, to prove their manhood and worth in the parlance of the time. This film details the struggle by hard abolitionist Massachusetts Governor Andrews and a significant portion of the white Boston citizenry, including the eventual leader of the regiment, Robert Gould Shaw and his parents, to create such a unit.The film goes on to look at the actual creation of the unit , its training, the troubles over pay, the racial animosities on both sides of the class line that were then current in that American time, the deployment of the regiment South and the mauling that it took at Fort Wagner, including the deaths of Shaw and many brave black soldiers. I will tell you the best part though, although this is not brought up in the film. At war's end what was left of the Massachusetts 54th marched through Charleston, South Carolina, in many ways the ideological and political center of the Confederacy, singing ""John Brown's Body"". That seems just about right. Hat's off to the 54th.Note: I have not mentioned the very good performances here by Denzel Washington as a testy recruit and Morgan Freeman as the wise old man of the regiment. Let me put it this way, if you had a choice, wouldn't you have this pair in this type of film. No-brainer, right?

Shaw and his drill sergeant prepare the recruits for war unaware that their superiors have no intention of using these troops in combat.The frustrated manual laborer-soldiers were eventually given the chance to engage a Confederate patrol and acquitted themselves well. They next spearheaded an assault on South Carolina's Fort Wagner. Shaw and over 100 of his men were killed in this action and more than 150 were wounded and/or captured.This film's strength is the depiction by a sterling cast of friendships between the men, their struggles with a bigoted military, and the at times uneasy interactions with an empathetic white commander. The battle scenes, culled from two sources (including a 1988 Gettysburg reenactment) are secondary to the human story.(DVD versionof GLORY is here)Also recommended: the 4-hour epic, GETTYSBURG-- one of the greatest war movies ever made.

With much narration taken from the actual letters written by the 25 year old white Colonel in charge of this, the first, all-black Regiment recruited from run-away slaves and freedmen in Massachusetts, it is beautifully filmed (Oscar to Freddie Young) and told with great, direct, emotional-truth; a fine & astonishing first directorial effort from Ed Zwick.All the performances in this superb ensemble cast are excellent.  Denzel Washington won the supporting Oscar, but it could just as easily have gone to Morgan Freeman (is that man capable of a bad performance?).  All the rest (Jimhi Kennedy, Cary Elwes, Andre Braugher)are fine as well.The performance I think overlooked is Mathew Broderick as the young Robert Gould Shaw.  A nuanced, sensitive and complex portrayal, Broderick captures the man's fluctuations between doubt and confidence, fear & courage.  His Shaw believes in the rightness of his cause, has seen (and been frightened by) the horrors of battle, is unsure of himself as a commander and leader.  We watch him grow & learn.  We see him come to understand these strange men (to his experience)he's been chosen to lead and we see him learn to love them.  One  great scene of many is where he tears up the pay chit if his men won't be paid fully (the moment he becomes THEIR Colonel).  Another, the guilty looking down and away at Washington's scars & subsequent flogging.But, the scene indelible in my memory is Shaw on horseback, looking out to sea before the last battle, and the play of emotions over Broderick's face.  At that moment you know he is in love with life and you know that HE knows he is going to die in the battle. It is silent, bittersweet & utterly truthful about all young men facing death in battle. And finally, we see his acceptance & resolve to carry on, and the bond between him and his men is final.  Courage.The story of the 54th Massachusetts is inspiring.  There is no better moment in film than when Denzel Washington picks up the dropped colors (which he had previously refused the honor of carrying) and charges forward.  At that moment, the black troops of the 54th claimed THEIR right to their part of the American dream... One last footnote, the famous sculpture shown at the end of the film of Shaw & the 54th was not, as I mistakenly surmised, commissioned by his wealthy family.  It was commissioned and paid for by veterans of the 54th.  There truly must have been a bond of respect and love between Shaw and his men.",5,Their Glory Was Real!,1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,2604,"['fine', 'true', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Civil', 'War', 'timeless', 'classic', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'much', 'narration', 'taken', 'actual', 'letters', 'written', '25', 'year', 'old', 'white', 'Colonel', 'charge', 'first', 'all-black', 'Regiment', 'recruited', 'run-away', 'slaves', 'freedmen', 'Massachusetts', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'Oscar', 'Freddie', 'Young', 'told', 'great', 'direct', 'emotional-truth', 'fine', 'astonishing', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Ed', 'Zwick.All', 'performances', 'superb', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'are', 'excellent', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'won', 'supporting', 'Oscar', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'have', 'gone', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'man', 'capable', 'bad', 'performance', 'rest', 'Jimhi', 'Kennedy', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'are', 'fine', 'well.The', 'performance', 'think', 'overlooked', 'Mathew', 'Broderick', 'young', 'Robert', 'Gould', 'Shaw', 'A', 'nuanced', 'sensitive', 'complex', 'portrayal', 'Broderick', 'man', 'fluctuations', 'doubt', 'confidence', 'fear', 'courage', 'Shaw', 'rightness', 'cause', 'seen', 'been', 'frightened', 'horrors', 'battle', 'unsure', 'commander', 'leader', 'watch', 'grow', 'learn', 'see', 'come', 'understand', 'strange', 'men', 'experience', 'been', 'chosen', 'lead', 'see', 'learn', 'love', 'One', 'great', 'scene', 'many', 'where', 'up', 'pay', 'chit', 'men', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'paid', 'fully', 'moment', 'THEIR', 'Colonel', 'guilty', 'looking', 'down', 'away', 'Washington', 'scars', 'subsequent', 'flogging.But', 'scene', 'indelible', 'memory', 'Shaw', 'horseback', 'looking', 'out', 'sea', 'last', 'battle', 'play', 'emotions', 'Broderick', 'face', 'moment', 'know', 'love', 'life', 'know', 'HE', 'going', 'die', 'battle', 'silent', 'bittersweet', 'utterly', 'truthful', 'young', 'men', 'facing', 'death', 'battle', 'finally', 'see', 'acceptance', 'resolve', 'carry', 'bond', 'men', 'final', 'Courage.The', 'story', '54th', 'Massachusetts', 'inspiring', 'better', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'up', 'dropped', 'colors', 'had', 'previously', 'refused', 'honor', 'carrying', 'forward', 'moment', 'black', 'troops', '54th', 'claimed', 'THEIR', 'right', 'part', 'American', 'dream', 'One', 'last', 'footnote', 'famous', 'sculpture', 'shown', 'end', 'film', 'Shaw', '54th', 'was', 'not', 'mistakenly', 'surmised', 'commissioned', 'wealthy', 'family', 'was', 'commissioned', 'paid', 'veterans', '54th', 'truly', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'bond', 'respect', 'love', 'Shaw', 'men']",N/A
160409,AFDYHKAH8AJDT,0800102150,A. Sloan,"[0, 0]","Once again you can't possibly have enough stars to rate this one in my opinion.  With the role that African Americans and other ethnic groups played in every war foreign and domestic being downplayed left and right, throughout history and films this was a long awaited breath of fresh air.  There was no sugar-coating, no side-stepping in this film at all from the opening battle at Antietum with it's very graphic war effects to it's heartbreaking, breath-taking ending.  The racism, self-loathing, pride, elation, fear, rage, strength and most of all bravery is all portrayed here and it keeps you mesmerized. It's such a mix of emotions.Every last performer in this movie was outstanding; even Cliff DeYoung's small role left a strong impression.  Matthew Broderick should have been nominated for an Academy Award for his performance as Robert Gould Shaw.  He was sedate yet he displayed such strength and determination. It was incredible and I can't say I've seen those traits come from him since.  Morgan Freeman also should have been nominated for his dignified portrayal as the newly promoted Sargent Major rallying his men. (I believe this was his breakout role). Another standout was the vulnerable and nave performance of Andre Braugher as Thomas, Robert Gould Shaw's friend/servant from home who volunteer's with the 54th.Last, but certainly not least is Denzel Washington the one-tear wonder!  His part of his portrayal of Pvt. Tripp is why he won the Oscar for this role.  Although there is very little dialogue between Matthew and Denzel except shortly before the last battle, their eyes tell the story between them which is a sight to behold.  The scenes between he and Andre Braugher were fantastic too.  There was such tension and anger and resentment over Thomas being educated from Denzel's  loose-cannon character that you wonder if he will derail any hopes of the 54th banding together.  It's Brilliant!  James Horner's score is perfection with the angelic voices of the Harlem Boys Choir being a perfect accompaniment to this masterpiece.

The raising of an all-black regiment in the Union Army is the focal point. There would be of course some racism involved like a black soldier's salary would be $3 less than a white soldier in this Union Regiment. But on the other side ( or enemy side), the Confederacy rules  that any black soldier caught by the Confederate Army and wearing a Union uniform would be summarily executed. There are always conflicts present in any good plot  like for example a black deserter named Trip ( played excellently by Denzel Washington) has to be punished severely, sometimes executed by courtmartial. But Trip was flogged until it was discovered that he already had scars on his back. All the roles played by Col.Shaw(Matthew Broderick), Trip (Denzel Washington) and Morgan Freeman,etc,etc were played so good according to many.One objection a few of my friends and I have is the battle strategies during those times, especially the Civil War. The same thing we observed in that excellent documentary ""Gettysburg"". Why these suicidal charges made by the Union soldiers (in this movie) and the Confederate soldiers ( in Gettysburg) against a relentless enemy fire from rifles and cannons. They just kept marching on and on and on without scattering here or there. Why not do it like the British soldiers in the Revolutuon: after the soldiers in front finish firing their muskets and begin reloading, the same soldiers behind them fire their muskets and then reload letting the third line of soldiers fire theirs,and so on and on.... so there will be a continuous volley of firepower. Maybe that was probably the Union or Confederate discipline in those days which we think is quite stupid.However, any criticsm aside, the movie Glory itself is worthwhile watching.

Nothing is expected in Glory, and certainly it is one of the most moving films I've seen. Outstanding all-around performances are given including by Cary Elwes, Morgan Freeman, Andre Braugher, Jihmi Kennedy, and John Finn. Above all, Matthew Broderick and Denzel Washington gave their bests. I am disappointed that not enough credit is paid to Matthew Broderick for his finest performance of his career. He certainly led the film on a high note throughout; and even though by looking at him, you wouldn't think of him as a great lead actor since his face isn't strong and articulate, but he proves it wrong in Glory. The one who gave the most spectacular performance is Denzel Washington, who shines in every scene in Glory and stuns me even greater through the nefarious flogging scene. Also, his heartfelt speech, at near of the end, is another remarkable scene. The ending, most of all, symbolizes what Glory is all about. Edward Zwick directed a masterpiece by its great cinematography work and realistic visual of the Civil War period, especially in the final sequence where Fort Wagner is depicted. Glory is probably one of the rare films portraying Denzel Washington at his very best because his potential was largely wasted by inferior directors including Spike Lee.7/11: Unquestionably, Glory is one of the, if not the, finest Civil War pictures made.

Matthew Broderick is  excellent as the Commander who received his position for politcal reasons  only and is in no way qualified to command this regiment.  The men he  commands are also not qualified for the positions they are in in the  regiment.  But everyone has the same goal in mind, and because of this they  manage to become a more-than-competent fighting machine.

If you want that then read a book.However, this movie is just as good as:1.  Blackhawk Down2.  All Quiet on the Western Front (Black and White version from the 1930s)3.  Tora, Tora, Tora4.  Apocalypse Now5.  Band of BrothersYes, Glory deserves to be on that list of great war movies.This movie is the first correct movie.  It correctly gets the muskets, the uniforms, the way of marching, and the general feel of the American Civil War.  Most movies prior to this movies were wrong, plain wrong.  Soldiers are shown moving in a WWI like movement of forces.  The old 1873 Springfield .45-70 ""trapdoor"" was used in movies prior to this.  It's like using an M-16 for a WWII show.  It's wrong.Glory is the first movie that got it all right.I would advise the viewer to watch this movie on a large screen TV.  The attack at the beginning of the movie on Confederate Positions at the Battle of Antitiam is one of the best cinema shootings of the Civil War ever made on the film.  Rumor has it that exploding dummy, used to replicate the union officer after getting hit by a cannon ball, was kept secret from Matthew Broderick to get a shot of his ""shocked"" look.That is what sort of gets to a viewer on this movie.  Union men are killed like cattle because of the wretched infantry tactics of the time and the equally wretched union generals (in any other army, like the Russian, they would have been shot).  However, activists will say this movie is full of hateful language.  Well, the movie is darn full of hate full language.  And it's a lot more full of dead men.The number of Union men killed and wounded at Antitiam was half of Vietnam in one day.  It's not an exaggeration that Robert Gould Shaw comments at a party ""they put me in charge because the rest of them [the other officers] are dead"".This reviewer really liked the part of the ""mustering in"" of the 54th Massachusetts.  It does a great job showing the rural setting of old America.  It also shows the rather hard scrabble life all African-American volunteers had to endure in the volunteering for service in America.This movie could be said to come in chapters.  The first two chapters are a prologue of Gould's life.  The middle chapters are about the trials and tribulations of the 54th in its training.  The last chapters are about the combat episodes of the 54th.Now, a new viewer will see some ""commerce"" raiding by Federal troops.  If anything it's not as bad as it actually was back then.  It was not without much grim truth that the smoking chimneys of burnt houses were called ""Sherman Monuments"" back in the 1864 era.I'm not going to give away too much of the movie.  I feel that the uninformed buyer has already been tripped off to the carnage that awaits them at the battle of Antitiam.  However, I have not even mentioned the face-to-face battles the 54th has with a Confederate unit on the coasts of the Carolinas.This move is 10 out of 10, not a minor 5 stars.  Personally, I think this movie should be required viewing for all 11th grade American history students.  Why?  There are two big reasons.  African Americans fought to save this nation.  Hundreds of thousands of Whites died to make African Americans free.If this movie does not move you then you're as brainless as Paris Hilton.",5,Perhaps the best Civil War Movie ever made,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,3355,"['5', 'StarsThis', 'one', 'great', 'war', 'movies', 'totally', 'historically', 'accurate', 'want', 'then', 'read', 'book.However', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'as:1', 'Blackhawk', 'Down2', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'Black', 'White', 'version', '1930s', '3', 'Tora', 'Tora', 'Tora4', 'Apocalypse', 'Now5', 'Band', 'BrothersYes', 'Glory', 'be', 'list', 'great', 'war', 'movies.This', 'movie', 'first', 'correct', 'movie', 'correctly', 'muskets', 'uniforms', 'way', 'marching', 'general', 'feel', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'Most', 'movies', 'prior', 'movies', 'were', 'wrong', 'plain', 'wrong', 'Soldiers', 'are', 'shown', 'moving', 'WWI', 'movement', 'forces', 'old', '1873', 'Springfield', '.45-70', 'trapdoor', 'was', 'used', 'movies', 'prior', 'using', 'M-16', 'WWII', 'show', 'wrong.Glory', 'first', 'movie', 'got', 'right.I', 'would', 'advise', 'viewer', 'watch', 'movie', 'large', 'screen', 'TV', 'attack', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Confederate', 'Positions', 'Battle', 'Antitiam', 'one', 'best', 'cinema', 'shootings', 'Civil', 'War', 'ever', 'made', 'film', 'Rumor', 'exploding', 'dummy', 'used', 'replicate', 'union', 'officer', 'getting', 'hit', 'cannon', 'ball', 'was', 'kept', 'secret', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'get', 'shot', 'shocked', 'look.That', 'what', 'sort', 'viewer', 'movie', 'Union', 'men', 'are', 'killed', 'cattle', 'wretched', 'infantry', 'tactics', 'time', 'equally', 'wretched', 'union', 'generals', 'other', 'army', 'Russian', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'However', 'activists', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'full', 'hateful', 'language', 'Well', 'movie', 'darn', 'full', 'hate', 'full', 'language', 'lot', 'more', 'full', 'dead', 'men.The', 'number', 'Union', 'men', 'killed', 'wounded', 'Antitiam', 'was', 'half', 'Vietnam', 'one', 'day', 'not', 'exaggeration', 'Robert', 'Gould', 'Shaw', 'comments', 'party', 'put', 'charge', 'rest', '[', 'other', 'officers', ']', 'are', 'dead', '.This', 'reviewer', 'really', 'liked', 'part', 'mustering', '54th', 'Massachusetts', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'rural', 'setting', 'old', 'America', 'also', 'rather', 'hard', 'scrabble', 'life', 'African-American', 'volunteers', 'had', 'endure', 'volunteering', 'service', 'America.This', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'come', 'chapters', 'first', 'two', 'chapters', 'are', 'prologue', 'Gould', 'life', 'middle', 'chapters', 'are', 'trials', 'tribulations', '54th', 'training', 'last', 'chapters', 'are', 'combat', 'episodes', '54th.Now', 'new', 'viewer', 'will', 'see', 'commerce', 'raiding', 'Federal', 'troops', 'anything', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'actually', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'not', 'much', 'grim', 'truth', 'smoking', 'chimneys', 'burnt', 'houses', 'were', 'called', 'Sherman', 'Monuments', 'back', '1864', 'era.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'feel', 'uninformed', 'buyer', 'already', 'been', 'tripped', 'carnage', 'battle', 'Antitiam', 'However', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'mentioned', 'face-to-face', '54th', 'Confederate', 'unit', 'coasts', 'Carolinas.This', 'move', '10', '10', 'not', 'minor', '5', 'stars', 'Personally', 'think', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', '11th', 'grade', 'American', 'history', 'students', 'Why', 'are', 'two', 'big', 'reasons', 'African', 'Americans', 'fought', 'save', 'nation', 'Hundreds', 'thousands', 'Whites', 'died', 'make', 'African', 'Americans', 'free.If', 'movie', 'not', 'move', 'then', ""'re"", 'as', 'brainless', 'Paris', 'Hilton']",N/A

I was pretty young when this movie was first released in 1989, but I can still remember all the discussion and controversy that ensued after its release.  I happened upon this movie and decided to see for myself if all the hoop-la was warranted.  While it may have been controversial in the 80s, the years have softened the movie's shock value, but it still remains a masterfully made and entertaining movie.This is the story of the black soldiers who fought for the Union during the Civil War.  Matthew Broderick plays a young colonel assigned to train a company of former slaves to become soldiers who will fight in the battle against the Confederacy.  Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Andre Braugher play three of the hundreds of black men who volunteer to join the army.  At first, the heads of the Union army treated this company of black soldiers as a joke.  They were recruited to fulfill some sort of quota.  They received poor equipment and low wages, and were never intended to fight in battle.  However, the colonel sees their desire and convinces his superiors to send them into battle.  The end of the movie has this company of black soldiers leading the Union arm into the battle at Fort Wagner in South Carolina.  Since this movie is based on actual events, it isn't too much of a spoiler to mention that they lost the battle for Fort Wagner, but the outcome of the battle isn't as important as the solidarity and patriotism with which they fought.I've seen ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"" many times, so I'm a little uncomfortable seeing Matthew Broderick in a serious role.  He's not much of a dramatic actor, but he does a solid job here.  Though Denzel Washington won an Academy Award for his supporting role, this was clearly an ensemble cast that equally shares the acclaim for their terrific performances.  Morgan Freeman seemed a little too old to be in a movie like this, but he also did a commendable acting job, as did Andre Braugher.This movie receives some criticism because historians claim that it doesn't accurately depict the actual events on which it is based.  I, personally, don't believe that historical accuracy should be a consideration when determining the quality of a movie.  I watch movies to be entertained, not educated.  If I wanted to learn about the actual facts I'll open a textbook or watch a documentary.  There was also a slight uproar by leaders of the black community who didn't appreciate a movie where black people were being taken advantage of.  Many were angered by the fact that they were deliberately put on the front lines in battle so they would be the first to die.All these disputes may never be resolved, but they cannot diminish the fact that this is a great movie.  Besides the great acting, there are very good special effects, good camera angles, and an awesome musical score.  I highly recommend that you see this movie.",4,"Controversial, But An Excellent Movie, Nevertheless",1043452800,"01 25, 2003",2003,2963,"['movie', 'most', 'definitely', 'one', 'greatest', 'war', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'pretty', 'young', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'released', '1989', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'discussion', 'controversy', 'ensued', 'release', 'happened', 'movie', 'decided', 'see', 'hoop-la', 'was', 'warranted', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'controversial', '80s', 'years', 'have', 'softened', 'movie', 'shock', 'value', 'still', 'masterfully', 'made', 'entertaining', 'movie.This', 'story', 'black', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'Union', 'Civil', 'War', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'young', 'colonel', 'assigned', 'train', 'company', 'former', 'slaves', 'become', 'soldiers', 'who', 'will', 'fight', 'battle', 'Confederacy', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'play', 'three', 'hundreds', 'black', 'men', 'who', 'volunteer', 'join', 'army', 'first', 'heads', 'Union', 'army', 'treated', 'company', 'black', 'soldiers', 'joke', 'were', 'recruited', 'fulfill', 'sort', 'quota', 'received', 'poor', 'equipment', 'low', 'wages', 'were', 'never', 'intended', 'fight', 'battle', 'However', 'colonel', 'desire', 'superiors', 'send', 'battle', 'end', 'movie', 'company', 'black', 'soldiers', 'leading', 'Union', 'arm', 'battle', 'Fort', 'Wagner', 'South', 'Carolina', 'movie', 'based', 'actual', 'events', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'spoiler', 'mention', 'lost', 'battle', 'Fort', 'Wagner', 'outcome', 'battle', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', 'solidarity', 'patriotism', 'fought.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ferris', 'Beuller', 'Day', 'Off', 'many', 'times', ""'m"", 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'seeing', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'serious', 'role', 'not', 'much', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'solid', 'job', 'here', 'Though', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'supporting', 'role', 'was', 'clearly', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'equally', 'shares', 'acclaim', 'terrific', 'performances', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'movie', 'also', 'did', 'commendable', 'acting', 'job', 'did', 'Andre', 'Braugher.This', 'movie', 'criticism', 'historians', 'claim', ""n't"", 'accurately', 'depict', 'actual', 'events', 'based', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'should', 'be', 'consideration', 'when', 'determining', 'quality', 'movie', 'watch', 'movies', 'be', 'entertained', 'not', 'educated', 'wanted', 'learn', 'actual', 'facts', ""'ll"", 'open', 'textbook', 'watch', 'documentary', 'was', 'also', 'slight', 'uproar', 'leaders', 'black', 'community', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'movie', 'where', 'black', 'people', 'were', 'being', 'taken', 'advantage', 'Many', 'were', 'angered', 'fact', 'were', 'deliberately', 'put', 'front', 'lines', 'battle', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'die.All', 'disputes', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'resolved', 'can', 'not', 'diminish', 'fact', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'good', 'camera', 'angles', 'awesome', 'musical', 'score', 'highly', 'recommend', 'see', 'movie']",N/A

Sometimes it takes a realm of fiction to bring that history to the masses. Director Edward Zwick's *Glory* not only revealed a small piece of history to 1980's America, but turned out to be a top-notch story. Tri Star's Special Edition DVD of *Glory* brings this well-made drama to current audiences.Story of *Glory**Glory* concerns the origin of the 54th Massachusetts: a black regiment formed early in the American Civil War. Based on history books and personal letters, Glory shows how the 54th was authorized initially to placate abolitionist groups. It follows Colonel Robert Gould Shaw as he turns this symbol into a genuine fighting force. Rampant racism in the Union Army obstructs the 54th, as they are denied the equipment, pay, and experience to prove itself. But our heroes fight back, beating the corrupt Army at its own game. Likewise, all of the main characters must overcome their differences and their own internal demons. *Glory* concludes with the bloody assault on Fort Wagner. A military failure, it succeeded on a political, social, and personal front.Special EditionBoth this DVD edition and the special edition VHS contain ""The True Story of *Glory* Continues"", a documentary narrated by Morgan Freeman. The DVD set also contains an additional supplementary short on letters written by members of the 54th. These documentaries provide the actual history behind the 54th Massachusetts, since *Glory* itself takes plenty of artistic liberties. Zwick explains his two deleted scenes, arguing they were redundant. Tri Star also provides a theatrical trailer for three films featuring Denzel Washington. *Glory's* image quality is good, but like most films, it has that annoying tendency to drop down the sound of battle, even when no one is talking. I shoot guns and I know how loud they can be; I want to hear those longarms crack!The Heart of It AllWhile Zwick's battle scenes mark the film, he is clearly more interested in the human drama set against the backdrop of history. He says as much in the commentary, and he shows it. Denzel Washington's character Trip is a cynic and a bully, who keeps himself and everybody down with racist language. He particularly targets Thomas, an educated freeman and family friend of Colonel Shaw, who has difficulty relating to his fellow soldiers. Sergeant Rawlins stands between these men; and he finds himself caught between the enlisted men and their officers (who don't always have the right solutions to the regiment's problems).Colonel Shaw in particular demonstrates the problems of the combat leader, and both the director and Matthew Broderick bring depth to his character. Much of the time, his character is confident, talented, and brave. But behind his bravado lurks a traumatized combat veteran, driven to prepare his regiment for the horror of rifled muskets, repeating pistols, and high-explosive shells. After the battle of Antietam Creek, loud noises make Shaw jump, and he suffers from flashbacks of a fellow captain's grisly death. When his character is promoted from Captain to Colonel, the audience can see the doubt in Broderick's face. Consequently, Shaw brutalizes his men in basic training, employing a particularly harsh Sergeant Major to prepare them. Soon, even his officers grow to resent Shaw.These details stand in contrast to films like director Randall Wallace's *We Were Soldiers* (2002), another major effort to bring dignity to a little-known piece of American history. Mel Gibson's characterization of Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore is so unflappable as to be unbelievable. He comes across as having conquered his demons, fearing only that he is leading his men into a massacre. Moore's men are pluralistic and loyal, with no interpersonal conflict. While the 54th must fight tooth and nail simply to get shoes, the 3/7 Air Cav has everything already handed to it. Ultimately, Moore's victory gave way to America's failure in Vietnam, whereas the 54th's defeat paved the way for an American victory. So while these two films might have a similar idea, *Glory* presents a sense of depth and achievement absent from *We Were Soldiers*.True, both groups of soldiers must grow. But Zwick takes his characters from nothing to something, whereas Wallace presents a troop with everything but their first blood. This is not to say that *Soldiers* doesn't please, but that it appeals on a completely different level than *Glory*.*Glory*, then, exemplifies classic story telling. Much of this can be attributed to the editing and cinematography. Zwick and photography director Freddy Francis indulge in plenty of dramatic camera movements, using then-new cranes and cradles. But Zwick minimizes the depiction of blood, and quick-cuts violence. This actually lets him pack multiple incidents in his battle scenes, and his battles arouse a chaos other films fail to achieve. Francis continues this trend by maximizing the extras, props, and set seen in frame. The directors and editors also make the most of the actors' facial expressions and body language, helping Denzel Washington to walk away with that Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.Zwick and Francis even use the sun and the sky to set mood. When Shaw is optimistic in the first minute of the film, the sun is bright and clear; but when Shaw marches into his first battle at Antietam, the filmmakers show the sun obstructed by black smoke. Gray and fog cover the skies all the way until the last act, when the sun shines bright and clear again.ConclusionIn the end, *Glory* satisfies. The film's payoff comes from its theme and its telling. The characters overcome different obstacles to achieve human dignity. *Glory* uses the American Civil War to demonstrate that if men are created equal, they die equal. And if humans are born alike and die alike, little excuse exists for the inequity in between.",5,Glory for Glory,1054339200,"05 31, 2003",2003,5915,"['History', 'shelves', 'files', 'yet', 'so',

160435,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,0800102150,Char,"[0, 0]","Am not qualified to comment about the factual accuracy of ""Glory,"" but from reading other reviews in the 4, 3, 2, and 1 categories, I've become convinced that the movie contains a lot of factual distortion and  would not be good material to use as a history lesson.  (Therefore, I'm puzzled about the credits at the end of the movie listing Shelby Foote as an adviser on the film.  Surely Foote would have known the facts and would have stood up for them.  So why all the discrepancies?)Well, most movies do play loose with ""facts"" in order to create moving dramatizations.As for the ""colored"" soldiers, their dialogue sounded very modern to me.  While watching the movie, though, I was inclined to go along with what was offered in the way of dialogue and story-line because I realized that the script-writer would have had to contrive all the human conflict and inter-action that occurred among the characters.  I rationalized that the script-writer probably felt that more modern-sounding dialogue would ""grab"" viewers more effectively.Since one reviewer documented the fact that the soldiers were not deprived of shoes and uniforms but were supplied them without any delays, and that there was no incident of any soldier being whipped, I've become less inclined to overlook the implausible dialogue and the story-line.  I would now agree with those who complain that there was a deliberate sensationalistic slant in the dramatization.Overall, in various scenes (for instance, in the conflict between Montgomery and Shaw which severely distorted the facts about Montgomery's actual attitudes which were non-racist and Shaw's actual attitude toward Montgomery which was not inimical--all of which I now know the truth about from having read a seemingly well-informed reviewers' complaints), I am thinking that there was a deliberate tendency to manipulate facts in order to create in viewers enhanced feelings of outrage with regard to racial matters.I suppose it is true what several reviewers say about the 54th Mass. regiment--that it was really made up of freed men, not run-away slaves.  What could have been the reasoning behind the distortion of that fact?War is not beautiful, but the main thing I liked about this movie was that the movie itself was artistically beautiful.  The cinematography was excellent and the terrific musical score added great depth of feeling.  While some viewers would fault any tendency to romanticize or glorify war (and I would agree, excepting I do greatly honor soldiers who willingly, sacrifically give their lives in some conscientious causes that are right and good),  I think it is also important to notice the high-minded sensibilities that motivated many of the people who took a responsible part in the Civil War, even though many of them surely would have avoided the horrors of war if they had believed there was any effective way to avoid it and settle the differences of the nation without it.  And yet there were surely many men who were gungho for war above all else.  I was touched by the passages from Shaw's letters to his parents, beginning with the one with his quote from Emerson.  It, like all the quotes from his letters, showed what a sensitive and idealistic, (and perhaps even ""delicate"" would be an appropriate adjective) conscience Shaw had.  He seemed to be a person who acted out of response to Truths that he believed were right and honorable, which was the mindset of all the abolitionists.  (And very likely Montgomery did act from those motives, too, from what I've now read about him, and yet he was depicted falsely in this movie as what seemed to me to be a despicable racist bigot--typical of Hollywood's usual portrayal of loathesome, hatable  ""Southerners.""  I was asking myself during scenes with Montgomery, ""Now wait, Is this Union officer a horrid Southern bigot, and, if not, why is he acting so much like the way Southerners are always portrayed in movies?"") (I am not a Southerner myself but I feel for them because of the prejudicial image of them that is perpetrated.)All through the movie I was aware that the actor playing Shaw was a slight, mild, boyish-seeming man.  He didn't seem to be a tough enough character to fulfill his role as a Colonel.  I wondered if the real Shaw was like that.  There was one quote from Shaw's letters in which he feared to seem too ""weak.""  Anyway, I thought the part was well-acted.  It made Shaw a lovable, gentle man, whether that was really the way he was or not.  The scene where Shaw passes his parents in a public parade with his soldiers who look so good struck me as very moving; it caused me to burst into tears.  (Military displays often have that effect, I guess, what with the drama of the spectacle.  Some people always cry at any kind of parade--and weddings and funerals.  I guess I'm becoming one of those types as I grow older and more full of human feeling.)While it is true that the story is told from the point of view of Shaw, especially at the beginning, the major black characters turned out looking like just as heroic good men as Shaw by the end of the movie.  All these major figures were equally memorable in their acting roles.  And in the real historical story, as in the movie, all the men were buried in a common grave where they still remain, together.  I see the movie as giving ""glory"" to all of them equally, not Shaw above the others.I was glad that the movie-makers included the worship service with prayer and singing that took place among the soldiers on the night before the crucial encounter that would cost many lives.In conclusion, I'd say again that this was a very good movie that I liked especially because it was artistically excellent.",4,"Good movie, artistically well done, fine musical score",1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,5708,"['Am', 'not', 'qualified', 'comment', 'factual', 'accuracy', 'Glory', 'reading', 'other',

I liked it when it first came out, and now watching it with my children all these years later, I like it even more.  It is a rare film that not only holds up over time, but I found it a more powerful experience than I had remembered.  Why does it hold up so well?It isn't just the story that this regiment plays in the Civil War, or the story of Shaw leading and fashioning these brave men into soldiers, although that is a terrific story.  There are also the very powerful moments in the film that stay in the memory.  Matthew Broderick shows the qualities and the youth of Robert Gould Shaw.  He is a young man of high ideals despite his family's wealth and position.  He also has the ability to show courage despite his very real fears.Denzel Washington is quite powerful as the powerful Private Trip.  He is a man who has been so tortured and so abused that his anger has twisted him.  Yet, he still has a strength and nobility that shines through in several unforgettable scenes.  Morgan Freeman provides his magisterial presence as John Rawlins, who is tender enough to care for the mute drummer boy and tough enough to provide credible leadership as the eventual Sergeant Major to these new soldiers.Andre Braugher is fantastic as Shaw's friend, the very literate freeman Thomas.  His enthusiasm for the cause is boundless and his transition to becoming a soldier is quite hard for him.  He has so far to go from his comparatively privileged private life to the hard life of an infantryman.  He makes the role live brightly.  Jihmi Kennedy brings a lot to the role of the illiterate, but kindhearted Jupiter and I wish we saw more of him  on the screen whether big or little.All of them make that gospel meeting the night before battle a powerful scene in the movie.And don't forget the wonderful Cary Elwes who plays Shaws more worldly friend Cabot Forbes.  While he is Shaw's subordinate, he also has a fierce independence.  In some ways he is stronger than Shaw and in other he is less.  However, I don't believe Forbes could have accomplished the job in getting these men formed and into battle simply because his worldliness would not have let him believe it was possible.  It was Shaw's idealism (in the movie) that made it happen.Terrific.

As a proud Southerner, I have to say no other film has ever had me cheering for a Union regiment taking on a company of Confederate soldiers.  I was a little worried that this film would demonize the South, but it proved to be a most even-handed treatment of all parties.  By demonstrating the racism of Northerners - soldiers and civilians alike - it paints a most nuanced portrait of the African-American men who seized the opportunity to don the blue uniforms and fight for a country many of them must have been unable to truly call their own.  That only makes their heroism and bravery all the more poignant.  The War Between the States can never be understood in simple black and white terms on any level, as many a Union soldier clearly wasn't fighting to emancipate the slaves (just as many a Rebel soldier wasn't fighting for slavery).Even when they actually used to teach actual history in the schools, the story of the 54th Massachusetts regiment was a subject that never really came up - and that is what gives Glory such an extraordinary amount of historical importance.  I wouldn't go so far as to say the heroism and sacrifice of this first African-American regiment in the Union army turned the tide in the War, but it did lead to the acceptance of actual black fighting soldiers in the Union ranks - and 210,000 such recruits certainly proved important for a fighting force that basically won through strength of numbers (as more blues than grays died in the war).The movie itself, though, is really about the men who led and made up the 54th Massachusetts regiment - and there are sterling performances all over the place.  As I have said many times in the past, Morgan Freeman is the best actor living today, and his character, Sgt. Major John Rawlins, is really the heart and soul of the whole film.  As an older, runaway slave, he has gained a measure of wisdom and restraint that Private Trip (Denzel Washington) has never even imagined.  Trip wears the scars on his back proudly, and he is not about to stand down before any man.  Washington earned a Best Supporting Actor award for his role, and rightly so.  Educated freemen are represented by Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), who seems ill-suited to the harsh realities of war but shoulders the burden with pride and determination.  At the head of these men rides Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), a young officer who secured the position more by family influence than merit, perhaps, but he more than rises to the challenge to fight both for and with his men.  Despite his lifelong friendship with Thomas, he has almost no connection with the men of the 54th and must learn to know them and earn their respect.  The Union army doesn't even want to supply his men with necessities such as decent shoes and a uniform, nor does it really have any intention of actually sending them into combat.  Thanks to the Colonel, though, the fighting men of the 54th do eventually get their chance to prove themselves by leading what is basically a suicidal charge against Fort Wagner in South Carolina.Aside from the multi-layered story itself, one must be impressed by the realism of the action.  War is an ugly business, and that fact is brought home in the very first scenes showing Colonel Shaw's charge during the Battle of Antietam.  While there should have been small rivers of blood covering the battlefield, watching a soldier's head basically explode makes for a vivid stamp of realism.  While I would question the tactics employed on the assault on Fort Wayne at the end, the movie certainly does capture the nature of the fog of war and the viciousness of hand-to-hand fighting by heroes on both sides.  Of course, this is a movie, so there are numerous historical inaccuracies as to the main characters (none of whom, other than Col. Shaw, are based on the actual soldiers) and battles, yet Glory certainly does succeed in telling the story of the 54th Regiment in the most compelling of ways.",5,They were soldiers,1152576000,"07 11, 2006",2006,4051,"['Glory', 'truly', 'extraordinary', 'motion', 'picture', 'sorts', 'ways', 'proud', 'Southerner', 'have', 'say', 'other', 'film', 'ever', 'had', 'cheering', 'Union', 'regiment', 'taking', 'company', 'Confederate', 'soldiers', 'was', 'little', 'worried', 'film', 'would', 'demonize', 'South', 'proved', 'be', 'most', 'even-handed', 'treatment', 'parties', 'demonstrating', 'racism', 'Northerners', 'soldiers', 'civilians', 'alike', 'most', 'nuanced', 'portrait', 'African-American', 'men', 'who', 'seized', 'opportunity', 'don', 'blue', 'uniforms', 'fight', 'country', 'many', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'unable', 'truly', 'call', 'own', 'only', 'heroism', 'bravery', 'more', 'poignant', 'War', 'Between', 'States', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'understood', 'simple', 'black', 'white', 'terms', 'level', 'many', 'Union', 'soldier', 'clearly', 'was', ""n't"", 'fighting', 'emancipate', 'slaves', 'just', 'as', 'many', 'Rebel', 'soldier', 'was', ""n't"", 'fighting', 'slavery', '.Even', 'when', 'actually', 'used', 'teach', 'actual', 'history', 'schools', 'story', '54th', 'Massachusetts', 'regiment', 'was', 'subject', 'never', 'really', 'came', 'up', 'what', 'Glory', 'extraordinary', 'amount', 'historical', 'importance', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'heroism', 'sacrifice', 'first', 'African-American', 'regiment', 'Union', 'army', 'turned', 'tide', 'War', 'did', 'lead', 'acceptance', 'actual', 'black', 'fighting', 'soldiers', 'Union', '210,000', 'such', 'recruits', 'certainly', 'proved', 'important', 'fighting', 'force', 'basically', 'won', 'strength', 'numbers', 'more', 'blues', 'grays', 'died', 'war', '.The', 'movie', 'though', 'really', 'men', 'who', 'led', 'made', 'up', '54th', 'Massachusetts', 'regiment', 'are', 'sterling', 'performances', 'place', 'have', 'said', 'many', 'times', 'past', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'best', 'actor', 'living', 'today', 'character', 'Sgt', 'Major', 'John', 'Rawlins', 'really', 'heart', 'soul', 'whole', 'film', 'older', 'runaway', 'slave', 'gained', 'measure', 'wisdom', 'restraint', 'Private', 'Trip', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'never', 'even', 'imagined', 'Trip', 'scars', 'back', 'proudly', 'not', 'stand', 'down', 'man', 'Washington', 'earned', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'award', 'role', 'rightly', 'so', 'Educated', 'freemen', 'are', 'represented', 'Thomas', 'Searles', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'who', 'ill-suited', 'harsh', 'realities', 'war', 'burden', 'pride', 'determination', 'head', 'men', 'rides', 'Colonel', 'Robert', 'Gould', 'Shaw', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'young', 'officer', 'who', 'secured', 'position', 'more', 'family', 'influence', 'merit', 'perhaps', 'more', 'rises', 'challenge', 'fight', 'men', 'lifelong', 'friendship', 'Thomas', 'almost', 'connection', 'men', '54th', 'must', 'learn', 'know', 'earn', 'respect', 'Union', 'army', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'supply', 'men', 'necessities', 'such', 'decent', 'shoes', 'uniform', 'really', 'have', 'intention', 'actually', 'sending', 'combat', 'Thanks', 'Colonel', 'though', 'fighting', 'men', '54th', 'do', 'eventually', 'get', 'chance', 'prove', 'leading', 'what', 'basically', 'suicidal', 'charge', 'Fort', 'Wagner', 'South', 'Carolina.Aside', 'multi-layered', 'story', 'must', 'be', 'impressed', 'realism', 'action', 'War', 'ugly', 'business', 'fact', 'brought', 'home', 'very', 'first', 'scenes', 'showing', 'Colonel', 'Shaw', 'charge', 'Battle', 'Antietam', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'small', 'rivers', 'blood', 'covering', 'battlefield', 'watching', 'soldier', 'head', 'basically', 'explode', 'vivid', 'stamp', 'realism', 'would', 'question', 'tactics', 'employed', 'assault', 'Fort', 'Wayne', 'end', 'movie', 'certainly', 'capture', 'nature', 'fog', 'war', 'viciousness', 'hand-to-hand', 'fighting', 'heroes', 'sides', 'course', 'movie', 'are', 'numerous', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'main', 'characters', 'none', 'whom', 'other', 'Col.', 'Shaw', 'are', 'based', 'actual', 'soldiers', 'battles', 'yet', 'Glory', 'certainly', 'succeed', 'telling', 'story', '54th', 'Regiment', 'most', 'compelling', 'ways']",N/A

Amith (kndy),"[18, 19]","In 1989, ""GLORY"" would become an important movie that introduced many Americans unfamiliar to Civil War history but most of all, to show viewers the impact African Americans had in the role of fighting for the Union.The film would focus on Col. Robert Gould Shaw, the letters he sent to his family and him leading a group of African American men who volunteered to fight against the Confederate Army.  This group is known as the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.  The film is also adapted from Lincoln Kirstein's book ""Lay this Laurel"" and Peter Burchard's book ""One Gallant Rush"".""GLORY"" was directed by Edward Zwick (""DEFIANCE"", ""Blood Diamond"", ""The Last Samurai"" and ""The Siege""), screenplay by Kevin Jarre (""The Mummy""and ""Rambo: First Blood Part II""), music by James Horner ""Enemy at the Gates"", ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Troy"") and cinematography by Freddie Francis (""Dune"", ""Clara's Heart"" and ""Cape Fear"").The film would star major talents Matthew Broderick (""WarGames"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""Godzilla"" and ""Inspector Gadget""), Denzel Washington (""American Gangster"", ""Training Day"", ""Man on Fire"" and ""Remember the Titans""), Morgan Freeman (""The Dark Knight"", ""Wanted"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Deep Impact""), Cary Elwes (""The Princess Bride"", ""Twister"", ""Liar Liar"" and ""Days of Thunder"") and Andre Braugher (""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"", ""Poseidon"", ""Frequency"" and ""Primal Fear"").The film would receive five Academy Award nominations and win three for ""Best Actor in a Supporting Role - Denzel Washington"", ""Best Cinematography - Freddie Francis"" and ""Best Sound Mixing"".""GLORY"" is powerful!VIDEO & AUDIO:""GLORY"" is presented on 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:85:1).  The film manages to capture the haziness of war due to the smoke in the battlefield and the colors are not featured as vibrant as most of the settings are in blues and browns but you will see reds on the flag and the flares, amber colors from the gunfire and the greens of the grass and tress, but I believe that the limit of color was the Director Edward Zwick's purpose.  Zwick is director that has made several films to capture the dreariness of war as he did nearly a decade later with ""ENEMY AT THE GATES"", he manages to capture the look of the battlefield in 1989 with ""GLORY"".The film does have quite a bit of grain that comes clear due to its High Definition transfer but I would rather have grain than overly used digital noise reduction that would make the characters look waxy and the picture quality as soft.  In fact, one thing you will notice with ""GLORY"" is you see quite a bit of detail of the actors, their surroundings but also objects such as shovels, rifles, clothing, etc.  But overall, the picture quality is solid.As for the audio, the film is featured in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (also in French, Portuguese in Dolby True HD 5.1 and Spanish 5.1) and the lossless soundtrack manages to capture the many explosions on the battlefield.  But what captures your attention when it comes to sound is James Horner's musical score.  The music sets the tone of the film especially during the final battle.  Dialogue is clear and very clean and many of the scenes during the battles where artillery, gun fire and people yelling (even those yelling from a far distance) can be heard.  There were scenes that do utilize the rear channels effectively and I believe there were some scenes where explosions took advantage of some low frequency booms on the subwoofer.  Overall, ""GLORY"" receives its best audio presentation compared to its original DVD counterpart.As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""GLORY"" comes with the following special features:* Audio Commentary by Director Edward Zwick - Edward Zwick is known for his war films from ""GLORY"", ""Enemy at the Gates"" and ""The Last Samurai"" and one thing that I enjoy about his commentaries is that he really gets into the technical goals and explain the difficult scenes.  ""GLORY"" features just that as he really goes into detail of the filming techniques used on the film.  Such as trying to drown out the blue skies with smoke, working with the talent, the staff, James Horner for the music and tidbits such as not having enough money to hire more stuntmen, so the stuntmen trained the extras on several scenes.  Also, how challenging it was for Morgan Freeman to have to run countless times especially uphill to having horses that were trained to fall.  A very informative commentary.* Virtual Battlefield - Civil War Guide Map - This was actually pretty good.  By using your remote, you can learn about certain battles from the Civil War with photography and text information.  But some have video commentary by Civil War historians which was quite informative.* The Voices of Glory - (11:16) This features letters from the Civil War written by actual soldiers of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry and giving a voice to the men who fought in the various battles including the battle at Fort Wagner. Featured in Standard Definition.* Documentary: The True Story of Glory Continues Narrated by Morgan Freeman - (45:18) A documentary featuring the factual information of the soldiers that fought during the war and were members of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry with additional detail on Col. Robert Gould Shaw.  Also, the coverage on the Civil War re-enactments that are ongoing today and an actual re-burial of soldiers.  A documentary that is very informative and you learn about other names that were instrumental during the battle against the Confederate Army at Fort Wagner.  Featured in Standard Definition.* Original Theatrical Making-of Featurette - (7:35) Featured in Standard Definition, this is the original featurette with interviews with the talent and Director Edward Zwick.  The featurette has a few behind-the-scenes footage from the film.* Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary - There is commentary by Director Edward Zwick on two scenes.  For The Applepicker (3:03), a scene which revolves around Pvt. Trip making his first kill.  The second and final deleted scene is one that Zwick calls one of his worst and glad it was cut from the film.  The scene is titled ""Crisis of Conscience"" (2:35) which is a scene involving both Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes).For those who owned the two-disc special edition DVD release of ""GLORY"", you may not want to ditch your DVD just yet as the ""Picture-in-Picture Video Commentary featuring Ed Zwick, Morgan Freeman & Matthew Broderick"" is not included on this Blu-ray disc.  Nor are the scene selections on the Blu-ray sporting any motion.JUDGMENT CALL:""GLORY"" is a powerful war film that shows an epic depiction of the battles that have taken place at that time.  Powerful performances from Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington and Andre Braugher, I was in awe of how epicly enormous this film was from start to finish.I really enjoyed ""GLORY"" for its storyline but also being educated about a part of Civil War that many people are probably not familiar with.In fact, Director Edward Zwick talked about in the commentary of going to Harvard University and living in Boston and never knowing the significance of the Memorial to Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment on the Boston Common.  And how he felt that this film not only was a positive for the people who worked on the film, great for his career but mostly for how significant the film is used by teachers using ""Glory"" as a tool to teach about the Civil War.The film definitely made me interested in learning more about the war but also key figures which include Colonel Shaw and American abolitionist Frederick Douglass.  But the film also opened my eyes at the time of how soldier placement truly was.  This is very interesting because these people stood probably less than a hundred yards from each other before they shot at each other.  Where forts had the use of cannonballs and artillery for long distance destruction, foot soldiers were just really close to each other and had to constantly reload their rifles.  And watching the final battle and in a way, oncoming military groups were like sitting ducks.  The military tactics of the time made me realize why the Civil War had the most number of deaths compared to Americans killed in World War I, II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined.Of course, the film and the actual history have some differences and its important to note that the only major character from the film's regiment that truly existed was Col. Robert Gould Shaw but the challenges that the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry faced during that time was quite real.  The combat role that African-Americans played in Civil War very much real.  The factual events, especially details that have come out right after the film was released is documented on ""The True Story Continues"" documentary which is included on the Blu-ray.Again, for those who own the 2-disc DVD Special Edition released back in 2007 and wonder if its worth the double dip.  For picture and audio quality, my answer is yes but I highly recommend not to get rid of the DVD as the ""Picture-in-Picture Video Commentary featuring Ed Zwick, Morgan Freeman & Matthew Broderick"" is not included on this Blu-ray release.  Personally, I think people would have loved to hear insight from both Freeman and Broderick about working on this film.  So, I'm a bit surprised it was not included on this Blu-ray release.But nevertheless, ""GLORY"" is still a solid Blu-ray release.  The HD transfer definitely gives the viewer more detail and makes the battlefield come alive.  It's a powerful film and definitely worth owning and having in your Blu-ray collection.",5,Blu-ray: Wonderful on Blu-ray.

The writing is excellent, the acting is superb, the cinematography is outstanding, the scope is epic with a phenomenal score that courses through the movie lending it amazing depth of emotion.  This film is flawless and filled to the brim with interesting characters and historical significance.  There are many fine acting performances here, the lead actors shining on several occasions.  Matthew Broderick has the performance in his career that finally shed that ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" stigma and established him as an A-list actor capable of carrying a dramatic role as well as sustaining comedy.  Denzel Washington is mesmerizing to watch, owning each and every scene he is in and completely earning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  Cary Elwes, fresh from his enthusiastic performance in the 1987 classic ""The Princess Bride,"" also shows some dramatic chops as surprising as Matthew Broderick brings to the table.  Then there is Morgan Freeman, who is the pride and center of the 54th Regiment of Massachusetts, and his performance sparkles accordingly.  There are so many great performances in this film that I could write for pages describing them all.  Of course, there are the incredible battle scenes, as well.  They are brilliantly staged, from long-range battle tactics to hand-to-hand combat with muskets fixed with bayonettes.  The intensity is realistic and exciting and oftentimes chilling.  At the time I saw this film in the theater back in 1989 I considered it the best Civil War film ever made.  In my mind, it has yet to be surpassed.

GLORY, director Edward Zwick's Civil War masterpiece, shows us the evolution of the 54th, from a ragtag group of former slaves and freemen--a group under supplied, underpaid, and initially used for manual labor and looting--to an efficient fighting machine.Like many other reviewers, I was pleasantly surprised by Matthew Broderick's portrayal as Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the young, idealistic leader of the 54th.  Broderick gives this character depth, compassion, credibility, and yes, maturity.  And what else can be said about the supporting cast, including Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Cary Elwes, other than &quot;exceptional?&quot;GLORY is profound entertainment:  gripping, violent, raw, and emotional as the fragile subject of race--of racism--is brought to the forefront.

Robert Shaw, this is a great movie for all and a great helper for the classroom (trust me, thanks to this movie I aced my American History final with ease).Matthew Broderick is young Col. Robert Shaw and he has been apointed to lead one of the first all black regimens following news of the Emancipation Proclamation made by President Abraham Lincoln.  From there, it follows all of his diary entries and his letters to home, showing the pride of soldiers and the strength to win a war.  Plus with the strong supporting cast of Carey Elwes, Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington, GLORY is a strong, dramatic and in some parts touching movie.I have to admit I was a skeptic when I heard that Matthew Broderick was going to be a lead in this movie because when I think Matthew Broderick, I think FERRIS BUELER.  Broderick really showed that he is a true actor in this movie and he did a very good job.  Denzel really showed why he won his Best Supporting Actor with his role and this movie and as usual, Morgan Freeman did very well.Now of course, this is the Civil War era and the N word is thrown around a lot.  In most cases, it's used out of context in a racist and/or derogatory way.  You have to get past that because as unfortunate as it is, that was a part of history.

Colonel Shaw is, at the beginning of the film (and forgive me for the change in genre and scale), like Frodo in The Lord of the Rings: a seemingly ordinary, anonimous, humble official of the Federate army who has been burdened (like Frodo) with a task that nobody wishes: the mustering and training of the first all-coloured volunteer regiment. However, his idealism and firm principles push him to do the best he can, and that turns out to be a lot. Throughout the movie we discover (with him, since he did not really know all the good qualities that he had inside) that he has the strength and courage to rise up to the moral, bureocratic and military-life challenges that are thrown in his way, always in accordance with his high idealistic, military and moral standards. These same standards give him the authority, towards the end of the film, to make life-or-death decissions for his men, and the courage to carry them out himself to the utmost consequences. The whole story revolves around this character, who is so superbly interpreted by Matthew Broderick that we can read on his face his feelings of embarrassment, outrage, fear, etc, although always in a subdued no-histrionic tone.

From the creation, the development and the heroic demise of the 54th.As all great epics do...artistic freedom is exercised by the creation of dramatized subplots.  Whereas some movies drop the ball here (AHEM, PEARL HARBOR), this movie excels.My favorite subplots are Morgan Freeman's, Denzel Washington's and the character Thomas (a free-black &quot;sissy&quot;).  One is the master of his soul.  He's a mature leader with great ideals and easily lovable.  Denzel is the anti-hero.  He is so dislikable yet admirable.  The character Thomas is neither accepted by blacks nor whites.  He is the Uncle Tom character who wins his battle for respect.I cried numerous times throughout this movie for reasons of tragedy and joy.  The highlight of this movie is the gospel-like campfire prayer of the black soldiers prior to the final scene of the movie.Every subplot is emotionally draining.  I rate this movie in my Top 5 of all time alongside Godfather 1 &amp; 2, Mississippi Burning, Empire Strikes Back and Black Rain.The DVD is the most feature-packed I own, and I own over 40.  Brilliantly remastered.  The sound, visuals, and features are incredible.  An 80's movie that makes 2000 movie's shameful in technical brilliance.  The play-along commentary by Morgan Freeman, Matthew Broderick and the creators were done separately.  But the DVD creators have brilliantly mixed up various comments so as to appear that all were in the same room together.  From Morgan Freeman's racially charged comments, the director's great insight into why he did what he did, to Matthew Broderick's anectdotal tales of his experiences making the movie.Don't just rent this DVD...BUY IT and watch it over and over again.

It is different from most civil war movies I've ever seen in that is focused on 1 regiment & it's struggles to serve.  I particularly like the job Matthew Broderick does in bringing his charcter Col. Robert G. Shaw to life as well as Morgan Freeman in his role as the top sergeant in the regiment. Fantastic stuff there!  The story is great, their first arrival, through the training & many hardships & some ridicule to their first battle ( after being used for looting & manual labor ) & their epic attack on Fort Wagoner.  One of my favorite lines in the movie  give 'em hell 54th!  was spoken by a soldier who earlier had harrased these same 54th soldiers for doing manual labor instead of fighting. This shows at least to a point these soldiers were accepted. ( I have a diary from an ancestor who fought in the civil war & in them the writer speaks of, well, barely accepting the idea of black soldiers in the army ). This is NOT my view by the way! I am a veteran & have had the privilage of serving with many fantastic, brave african american soldiers.

160500,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,0800102150,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[6, 6]","The title of this review pretty much says it all, but I'm going to go into a little more detail because it's necessary. Sadly, this film was nominated for very few awards in 1989, but it did win some. The most easily recognizable being Denzel Washington's Best Supporting Actor Oscar. He deserved it.Onto the film. Very few directors have been able to catch the sheer horror of war as well as Ed Zwick, especially since the film opens during The Battle of Antetiam, one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War, which is arguably the worst time in American History. I would have to say that the horror of the opening sequence, with the battle on the field to the grotesque conditions of an Army field hospital, can only be trumped by Spielberg's D-Day sequence in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Both that film and GLORY have a great deal in common. They both begin and end as epic war films but have an undeniable human element that reflects throughout the rest of the film. However, GLORY succeeds on a higher level because of its players and its story, which until this film was released, was largely unknown.First the story, with a brilliant script by Kevin Jarre, centers around the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first unit of soldiers in American History to have blacks. It was only a footnote, as I stated before, until the film was released. Unfortunately for the soldiers of the 54th, they would be confronted by prejudice at every turn; by their fellow Northerners, even the government. They would overcome and inspire, and the story, sad as it is, has inspired generations.Now the players: Matthew Broderick, in the finest performance he will ever commit to celluloid, portrays Col. Robert Gould Shaw, the son of a very wealthy Boston family, whose idealism of a whole nation inspired him to become a soldier, whose family and their political connections assisted his rapid rise in rank into eventually commanding the 54th, but whose own courage inspired him to lead this unit. Broderick is magnificent in this film. He never has a moment that rings false.Morgan Freeman, who has never given anything but a truly authentic performance (ok, there's DREAMCATCHER) but as Rawlins, the gravedigger who has buried the bodies of those who have died to free the slaves, he brings a deep intelligence and great strength to this role.Cary Elwes, when he was in his prime, before films like DAYS OF THUNDER and KISS THE GIRLS, is terrific as Shaw's best friend and second-in-command Major Cabot Forbes, who sees himself as a screw-up but is in actuality a very good commanding officer and a true friend to Shaw (and also a great devil's advocate for him as well).Andre Braugher is dynamic as Thomas, a lifelong friend of Shaw and Forbes who also grew up in relative luxury, is a somewhat superior ""man of the world"" but has much to learn about being a soldier. Also his friendship with Shaw and Forbes becomes endangered because of his status as an enlisted man, unable to speak freely to his friends.And then there's Denzel. He's Denzel. Essentially he is an actor much like Freeman who can dissolve into any role. In GLORY, he is Tripp, a runaway slave who wants to fight. In some moments it seems he wants to fight so badly that he will fight his own comrades. But in a role that could just be there for antagonism, Denzel gives it such depth and layering that what may have been very two-dimensional in a lesser actor's hands becomes the highlight performance of the film.Also shining in the film are Bob Gunton and Cliff DeYoung who see the black soldiers as nothing more than animals who steal and destroy for their own personal gain.Ed Zwick is a masterful director, and he has a great flair for directing the epic scenes and the smaller interpersonal scenes. The recreation of the time period is superb, and the entire look of the film is aided in no small part by Freddie Francis' awesome cinematography. I also have to mention something that elevates this film even further than it was even with all these assets already, and that is James Horner's magnificent score. You may see reviews of the score who claim plagarism. Even if that were true, it still compliments the film 100% of the way through. It's one of the few film scores, in my estimation, that can tell a tale on it's own without even having seen the film.All in all, I cannot find a flaw with this film. And it is so entertaining and intelligent and supremely involving, you will feel that you're there.

Glory is the true story of how the Black Americans in the 54th Regimen fought for a country that didn't appreciate them.  Not enough can be said about this movie.  The story is solid, the performances by the actors is excellent.  Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington and several other black actors give fantastic performances as black men, but all of them very different black men.  An escaped slave, a grave digger, and an educated free black man (from the time when blacks were free in Boston).  Broderick gives one of his most unique performances to date, setting aside the image of Ferris Bueller to play a young Colonel who trains and prepares the men for combat.  His performance is accurate, playing a young but smart and wise Commanding officer who genuinely believes his men are equal soldiers to any other regimen.  The movie is powerful, beautiful, frightening and thought provoking.  The men who died in this story died for real, and for almost nothing.  Their story should be told to everyone, so they can realize that more then just the heroes who wrote history existed.  Highly recommended, especially the Special Edition DVD.

160509,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,0800102150,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[9, 10]","""Glory"" is a modern film classic that highlights a little-known chapter of the Civil War that I'm happy to own. This film brings the issues of the time - slavery, freedom and sacrifice - down to human scale. We can understand why the men of the 54th were willing to take up arms, and how tragic it was that they had to sacrifice their lives in order to be considered men.Broderick, Freeman, and Washington, along with a stellar cast play it faultlessly. Broderick actually does bear a resemblance to Shaw, and shouldn't be criticized for his boyish looks. I felt every nuance of the burden he carried, and thought Broderick did a wonderful job.Denzel Washington's powerful acting may never again have a showcase like it did in ""Glory."" His beauty, rage, and pride scream in every frame. His Oscar for this break-out role was highly deserved. Trip's character is really the distillation of what this film is all about: the black man's heart-rending battle for worth, recognition, and dignity. As far as I'm concerned no one BUT Washington could have played Trip. Thank God for Denzel!Morgan Freeman is the film's human core. His quiet compassion and leadership keeps the soldiers focused. His one angry confrontation with Trip proves he has the goods to back up a field promotion to Sergeant Major.Freeman (an appropriate reminder of where surnames come from) is the father figure the regiment desperately needs in a time of death and crisis. The men look to him for his calming wisdom and reasonable, fair demeanor.Films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" raised the technical bar for battle scenes.The fighting scenes in ""Glory"" are, unfortunately, it's weakest element. The staging and choreography are mediocre at best. And other than a scene where the 54th Massachusetts is given a hero's flanking onto the battlefield beaches of South Carolina, these shots don't emotionally engage the viewer. Still, in the end, ""Glory"" isn't about big, noisy battles. It's about the transcendence of the human spirit in the face of bigotry, bad treatment, and almost certain death. It's about a watershed moment in our bloody history that elevated us all and must never be forgotten.""Glory"" is, indeed, glorious.",5,I am compelled to feel too many emotions while watching this film.,1144281600,"04 6, 2006",2006,2194,"['Glory', 'modern', 'film', 'classic', 'little-known', 'chapter', 'Civil', 'War', ""'m"", 'happy', 'own', 'film', 'issues', 'time', 'slavery', 'freedom', 'sacrifice', 'down', 'human', 'scale', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'men', '54th', 'were', 'willing', 'take', 'up', 'arms', 'how', 'tragic', 'was', 'had', 'sacrifice', 'lives', 'order', 'be', 'considered', 'men.Broderick', 'Freeman', 'Washington', 'stellar', 'cast', 'play', 'faultlessly', 'Broderick', 'actually', 'bear', 'resemblance', 'Shaw', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'criticized', 'boyish', 'looks', 'felt', 'nuance', 'burden', 'carried', 'thought', 'Broderick', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job.Denzel', 'Washington', 'powerful', 'acting', 'may', 'never', 'again', 'have', 'showcase', 'did', 'Glory', 'beauty', 'rage', 'pride', 'scream', 'frame', 'Oscar', 'break-out', 'role', 'was', 'highly', 'deserved', 'Trip', 'character', 'really', 'distillation', 'what', 'film', 'black', 'man', 'heart-rending', 'battle', 'worth', 'recognition', 'dignity', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'one', 'BUT', 'Washington', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'Trip', 'Thank', 'God', 'Denzel', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'film', 'human', 'core', 'quiet', 'compassion', 'leadership', 'soldiers', 'focused', 'one', 'angry', 'confrontation', 'Trip', 'goods', 'back', 'up', 'field', 'promotion', 'Sergeant', 'Major.Freeman', 'appropriate', 'reminder', 'where', 'surnames', 'come', 'father', 'figure', 'regiment', 'desperately', 'time', 'death', 'crisis', 'men', 'look', 'calming', 'wisdom', 'reasonable', 'fair', 'demeanor.Films', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'raised', 'technical', 'bar', 'battle', 'scenes.The', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'Glory', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'weakest', 'element', 'staging', 'choreography', 'are', 'mediocre', 'best', 'other', 'scene', 'where', '54th', 'Massachusetts', 'given', 'hero', 'flanking', 'battlefield', 'beaches', 'South', 'Carolina', 'shots', 'do', ""n't"", 'emotionally', 'engage', 'viewer', 'Still', 'end', 'Glory', ""n't"", 'about', 'big', 'noisy', 'battles', 'transcendence', 'human', 'spirit', 'face', 'bigotry', 'bad', 'treatment', 'almost', 'certain', 'death', 'watershed', 'moment', 'bloody', 'history', 'elevated', 'must', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'Glory', 'indeed', 'glorious']",N/A

Michael Click,"[72, 82]","Here's one of those rare movies that succeeds as both a sweeping, visually sumptuous historical epic AND an intimate, character-driven personal drama.  This fact-based account of the first black regiment to fight for the Union in the Civil War is filled with scenes of grand pageantry: the bloody battle at Antietam Creek; the first assembly of the 54th Regiment; the proud parade of the finally-trained and uniformed soldiers; the climactic attack on Fort Wagner.  And yet despite these heart-pounding, majestic sequences, the film at no time loses its focus on the individual characters  whose stories provide an emotional connection to the action.  The performances of the once-in-a-lifetime cast are uniformly superb: Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman, and Andre Braugher are all at the top of their game, and Denzel Washington (who deservedly won the Supporting Actor Oscar) is amazing, especially in the scene in which he undergoes a bitterly harsh punishment.  The dozens of emotions that flicker across Washington's face in that sequence, wordlessly conveying his character's essence, represent a powerful economy of acting that is rarely achieved in any medium.Happily, the DVD transfer of this cinematic masterpiece is  exceptional.  The Oscar-winning Cinematography and Sound are beautifully showcased, putting the viewer right in the middle of the story.  (You'll understand Francis Scott Key's line about ""the rockets' red glare"" on a level you never before imagined!)  And James Horner's soaring, elegant musical score is a revelation.  This absorbing film makes for a phenomenal DVD experience!________________________________________BLU-RAY UPDATE:  My original review was based on the first, single-disc DVD edition of ""Glory"".  At the time, I lamented the lack of special bonus features that I felt would have enhanced viewers' understanding and enjoyment of the film.  A few years later, a 2 Disc DVD of the film was released, which contained a wealth of bonus materials.  I upgraded, and was very happy with the 2 disc edition.I recently upgraded again, to the 2009 Sony Blu-Ray release, and am happy to report that the film looks and sounds better than ever.  Comparing it to the previous Laser-Disc and DVD editions, I can honestly say that the Blu-Ray package is worth the additional expense, if you're as big a fan of the movie as I am.  Several of the bonus features from the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD have been retained, and there's also an impressive Virtual Civil War Interactive Battlefield Map exclusive to the Blu-Ray.

The actors are excellent, the musical score is something special and it tells an extraordinary story &#8211; that of the men that formed the first Black regiment to actively fight in the US Civil War. While slavery was not the main reason the war started, it certainly became a bigger element as time progressed. The four main black characters give face to some of the types of men who were products of this system. Together they experience the harsh training, ongoing racism and ultimately deadly combat. I particularly liked how the film focused on the military aspect. War is shown in its full horror, with the final charge covered in great detail. There are also no unnecessary sub-plots. The focus is on the men and their mission. Yes, some latitude has been taken with the precise history of the unit (that first fight wasn&#8217;t as destructive to the Confederate cause as implied here) but I liked how the characters, Shaw aside, were fictional and could be developed to inform us of the times.

Those scenes look even more out of place when compared to the hi def look of the rest of the movie.  Again, this comes down to whether you really want ""what the director intended"" or a cleaned up version of the film.  I just found these scenes and certain re-recorded dialogue scenes sorely out of place in a hi def movie.  I also found some of the normal dialogue hard to hear at times, so it seemed like overall the soundtrack was a bit uneven.I didn't compare it back to back with the standard DVD, but for me the mix of intentionally hazy scenes/muffled dialogue and hi def scenes and audio resulted in an uneven final product.",3,Blu ray a mixed bag,1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,1258,"['only', 'review', 'blu-ray', 'are', 'plenty', 'reviews', 'movie', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'blu-ray', 'reaction', 'will', 'probably', 'depend', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'want', 'faithful', 'recreation', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'theaters', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'are', 'are', 'looking', 'blu-rays', 'be', 'noticeable', 'improvement', 'DVDs', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed.There', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'movie', 'where', 'hazy', 'look', 'when', 'Robert', 'out', 'morning', 'ride', 'chopping', 'watermelons', 'still', 'remain', 'blu-ray', 'scenes', 'look', 'even', 'more', 'place', 'when', 'compared', 'hi', 'def', 'look', 'rest', 'movie', 'Again', 'down', 'really', 'want', 'what', 'director', 'intended', 'cleaned', 'up', 'version', 'film', 'just', 'found', 'scenes', 'certain', 're-recorded', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'sorely', 'place', 'hi', 'def', 'movie', 'also', 'found', 'normal', 'dialogue', 'hard', 'hear', 'times', 'seemed', 'overall', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'bit', 'uneven.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'compare', 'back', 'back', 'standard', 'DVD', 'mix', 'intentionally', 'hazy', 'scenes/muffled', 'dialogue', 'hi', 'def', 'scenes', 'audio', 'resulted', 'uneven', 'final', 'product']",N/A

I saw the film when it came out in 1989 and was impressed.  I recently saw it again with my daughter, who is fascinated with the Civil War and had not seen the film.  It holds up as well over the years as any film I have seen.  The music, the cinematography, everything is outstanding.  I was in tearful awe throughout the second half.Drawing on the letters of Commander Shaw, the story is told through his eyes.  A young man, he is growing into maturity as a person.  As a soldier he is training the black men in his command to be disciplined troops when most people don&#8217;t believe they are capable of such.  Matthew Broderick is believable as Shaw, and Denzel Washington (who won an Academy Award for his role) and Morgan Freeman are perfectly cast as the leaders in the black company who educate Shaw about race and human nature.Everything in the film leads up to the final bloody battle scene, a suicidal march up a hill that accomplishes little in concrete military terms but is of incalculable symbolic importance, giving depth to the word &#8220;glory&#8221; and making it the appropriate title for this film.",5,A glorious film,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",2013,1356,"['Glory', 'story', '54th', 'Regiment', 'Massachusetts', 'Volunteer', 'Infantry', 'made', 'black', 'soldiers', 'Northern', 'freemen', 'escaped', 'slaves', 'led', 'whites', 'including', 'Robert', 'Gould', 'Shaw', 'son', 'Boston', 'abolitionists', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'out', '1989', 'was', 'impressed', 'recently', 'saw', 'again', 'daughter', 'who', 'fascinated', 'Civil', 'War', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'years', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'music', 'cinematography', 'everything', 'outstanding', 'was', 'tearful', 'awe', 'second', 'half.Drawing', 'letters', 'Commander', 'Shaw', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'young', 'man', 'growing', 'maturity', 'person', 'soldier', 'training', 'black', 'men', 'command', 'be', 'disciplined', 'troops', 'when', 'most', 'people', 'don', '8217', 'believe', 'are', 'capable', 'such', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'believable', 'Shaw', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'role', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'leaders', 'black', 'company', 'who', 'educate', 'Shaw', 'race', 'human', 'nature.Everything', 'film', 'up', 'final', 'bloody', 'battle', 'scene', 'suicidal', 'march', 'up', 'hill', 'little', 'concrete', 'military', 'terms', 'incalculable', 'symbolic', 'importance', 'giving', 'depth', 'word', '8220', 'glory', '8221', 'making', 'appropriate', 'title', 'film']",N/A

I was never a student of the civil war and I started to research the subject but I could not find  very much about this battle at Fort Wagner.  Finally I found a reference to  this battle and drove to Chicago and went to the Historical Society.  I  later purchased an antique book listing all the Michigan Regiments and the  101st Michigan Black Vounteers that fought alone side the 54th  Mass.Other than the fact of being enlightened by a wonderful story I was  moved by their pride.  I later joined a Michigan Re-enactment Regiment.  I  continued to watch a particular part of the movie to motivate me in my  business.  It has changed my life.  The troops are sitting together around  a fire signing to build their spirt.  Tomorrow their are going to find  themselve in front of a Fort that is well protected and they know and  realize that they will be in harms way and the majority of them with be  killed.

160526,A18BV4O63DOWNH,0800102150,"""juno2""","[17, 19]","probably because it tells such a unique story.  *Glory*  traces the fortunes of the first African-American regiment in the history of the U.S. military, and as such should be an eye-opener for those who picture the Civil War as mainly old daguerrotypes of bearded generals chomping cigars a la Grant or Lee.  It's also an important reminder of what the war was, when you get down to it, really about:  the bid for Black freedom.  By telling the story of the Massachusetts 54th, director Edward Zwick finds a natural and compelling focus of our nation's greatest conflict.Zwick takes some mighty risks, courting the mawkish.  Several scenes stand out as breathtaking, all the more so because they could have been  (and typically are)  so badly executed:  the scene where Matthew Broderick's Colonel Shaw stands watching, aghast, as his new recruits receive their first Government-issue rifles, acting as if they're about to go on a grand hunting-party, knowing nothing of the horrors that await them . . . another scene late in the film when the 54th are about to take a beach-side fort in the Carolinas, where the camera massively sweeps the fort itself, the surrounding geography, the massing troops straining at the slip  (the ensuing charge is THRILLING) . . . the scene where the 54th enters the South  (a return trip for most), encountering along the way a group of African-American children whose awe at seeing Black men in uniform provides one of the finest depictions of  &quot;hope&quot;  I've ever seen in cinema . . . the arguably  &quot;centerpiece&quot;  scene midway through, where Colonel Shaw and Denzel Washington's angry Private Trip enact, in a matter of a few heartbreaking cinematic moments, the entire basis of the causes of the Civil War as well as of our ongoing troubles  (the defiance with which Trip rips off his tattered shirt, almost proudly revealing the many quirt-scars on his back, is also THRILLING) . . . and perhaps my favorite scene, just before the attack on the fort, where Colonel Shaw, alone on the beach, frees his horse, watches the gulls fly seaward, and, knowing full well he and most of his troops won't survive the attack, says farewell to the sky, the sea, the earth, and his own life.  The notion, of course, being that it just might be a glorious thing to give one's life for a cause that is greater than that life.  Now that's an old-fashioned notion, ridiculed by the cynics who  (understandably)  have been disillusioned by the recent examples of our Vietnam and Kuwait adventures, but then the events portrayed in  *Glory*  happened in old-fashioned times.  Old-fashioned or not, men like Colonel Shaw, Privates Trip and Rawlins, by giving their lives fighting a war that had to be won so that we could all be free, &quot;so that all can speak&quot;, are what made this nation the greatest in the world, and are heroes we can point to with solemn and real patriotic pride.  *Glory*  is a masterpiece.",5,"The best Civil War movie, ever . . .",979171200,"01 11, 2001",2001,2954,"['probably', 'such', 'unique', 'story', '*Glory*', 'fortunes', 'first', 'African-American', 'regiment', 'history', 'U.S.', 'military', 'such', 'should', 'be', 'eye-opener', 'who', 'picture', 'Civil', 'War', 'mainly', 'old', 'daguerrotypes', 'bearded', 'generals', 'chomping', 'cigars', 'la', 'Grant', 'Lee', 'also', 'important', 'reminder', 'what', 'war', 'was', 'when', 'get', 'down', 'really', 'bid', 'Black', 'freedom', 'telling', 'story', 'Massachusetts', '54th', 'director', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'natural', 'compelling', 'focus', 'nation', 'greatest', 'conflict.Zwick', 'mighty', 'risks', 'courting', 'mawkish', 'Several', 'scenes', 'stand', 'out', 'breathtaking', 'more', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'typically', 'are', 'so', 'badly', 'executed', 'scene', 'where', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Colonel', 'Shaw', 'watching', 'aghast', 'new', 'recruits', 'receive', 'first', 'Government-issue', 'rifles', 'acting', ""'re"", 'go', 'grand', 'hunting-party', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'horrors', 'await', 'scene', 'late', 'film', 'when', '54th', 'are', 'take', 'beach-side', 'fort', 'Carolinas', 'where', 'camera', 'massively', 'fort', 'surrounding', 'geography', 'massing', 'straining', 'slip', 'ensuing', 'charge', 'THRILLING', 'scene', 'where', '54th', 'enters', 'South', 'return', 'trip', 'most', 'encountering', 'way', 'group', 'African-American', 'children', 'awe', 'seeing', 'Black', 'men', 'uniform', 'one', 'finest', 'depictions', 'quot', 'hope', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'cinema', 'arguably', 'quot', 'centerpiece', 'quot', 'scene', 'midway', 'where', 'Colonel', 'Shaw', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'angry', 'Private', 'Trip', 'enact', 'matter', 'few', 'heartbreaking', 'cinematic', 'moments', 'entire', 'basis', 'causes', 'Civil', 'War', 'as', 'well', 'ongoing', 'troubles', 'defiance', 'Trip', 'tattered', 'shirt', 'almost', 'proudly', 'revealing', 'many', 'quirt-scars', 'back', 'also', 'THRILLING', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'scene', 'just', 'attack', 'fort', 'where', 'Colonel', 'Shaw', 'alone', 'beach', 'horse', 'gulls', 'fly', 'seaward', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'most', 'troops', 'wo', ""n't"", 'survive', 'attack', 'farewell', 'sky', 'sea', 'earth', 'own', 'life', 'notion', 'course', 'being', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'glorious', 'thing', 'give', 'one', 'life', 'cause', 'greater', 'life', 'Now', 'old-fashioned', 'notion', 'ridiculed', 'cynics', 'who', 'understandably', 'have', 'been', 'disillusioned', 'recent', 'examples', 'Vietnam', 'Kuwait', 'adventures', 'then', 'events', 'portrayed', '*Glory*', 'happened', 'old-fashioned', 'times', 'Old-fashioned', 'not', 'men', 'Colonel', 'Shaw', 'Privates', 'Trip', 'Rawlins', 'giving', 'lives', 'fighting', 'war', 'had', 'be', 'won', 'so', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'free', 'quot', 'can', 'speak', 'quot', 'are', 'what', 'made', 'nation', 'greatest', 'world', 'are', 'heroes', 'can', 'point', 'solemn', 'real', 'patriotic', 'pride', '*Glory*', 'masterpiece']",N/A

Ignored for the &quot;big&quot; Academy awards, the film has become a classic on VHS and DVD.  This version allows the watcher to view in either widescreen or full screen.  Each CD has different special features and all are laudable.  I especially enjoyed the feature with Morgan Freeman narrarating the related documentary.All the effects of war demonstrated by Spielberg in &quot;Private Ryan&quot; are covered in realistic detail at the time of the Civil War.  The tale is of the 54th - a division of the Union army, staffed, through political pressure of the day, with Negro soldiers and white officers.  The complexity of emancipation is demonstrated throughout the division, in gathering Negroes from all walks of life.  Andre Braugher is unforgettable as Thomas, a second generation &quot;free man&quot;, well educated, and completely unfamiliar and uncomfortable with his fellow black men.  Newly freed slaves mingle and learn with black men who have been outside the yoke of slavery for many years.  The parochialism of even the abolitionists when it comes to understanding the rich texture of the Negro experience in the 19th century is vested in the officers of the regiment.Denzel Washington took home the only major Oscar, for best supporting actor.  His role can be best described by viewing the two most powerful scenes in the movie - his punishment at the hands of the white colonel, and his leadership in the &quot;paycheck&quot; rebellion.  Braugher, Washington &amp; Freeman have all reaped rewards in 90's film and TV by virtue of their strong performances here.  Matthew Broderick lets you know that he is not only a gifted comedic actor, but a believable hero in a lead dramatic role.The music is brilliant.  It soars above the commonplace scenes of soldiers' lives and the battleground clashes as though it was always there.It is difficult to define the impact this film had on me, and why I regard it with such esteem.

Fortunately this is not the case!It is a great reconstruction of the Civil War period based on personal letters from Col. Shaw and two books: Kirstein's ""Lay this Laurel"" and Burchard's ""One Gallant Rush"". From this solid documental background an outstanding film emerges.The storyline follows the evolution of the first all Afro American Regiment in the USA Army.Show step by step from the recruiting, boots camp practice, first war actions till the mighty final charge.Col. Shaw and his aide Maj. Forbes should fight prejudice within the officers and high command.Sgt. Major Rawlings should fight to bring together his green bunch of recruits into a soldier's team, proud of themselves and capable to endure and overcome all obstacles.Pvt. Trip should fight to tame his rebel soul in order to be part of the group.The movie has many great moments; three of them are delivered in the last fifteen minutes: the soldier's meeting the night before the attack, the regiment passing thru the deployed army and the glorious final charge. Really unforgettable!Matthew Broderick has the perfect physque-du-rol to impersonate a very young man (almost wet behind the ears) charged with an overwhelming task. He delivers a nice acting piece.This said, undoubtedly, the best acting performance are in charge of Denzel Washington, justly awarded with Best Supporting Actor Oscar, and Morgan Freeman.Edward Zwick as director (he is also a very successful producer) delivers his best film up to this day. Better IMHO to ""The Last Samurai"" (2003) that was a very good one.I hope he will give the public a good version of one of my favorite fiction book: ""The Lions of Al-Rassan"" (promised for next year).This is for me the best Civil War movie I've seen.

It's already been said.  Morgan Freeman should receive awards just for breathing.  He's phenominal.  Just think, all that talent going to waste on that kids show, the electric company, many years ago.  His best scene is probably when he comes across Shaw for the second time.  The first time they meet is just after a battle where Shaw is wounded and laying on the ground, unconcious.  Freeman's character kicks Shaw to see if he's still alive (he was the grave digger).  The second time they lay eyes on each other, Shaw is reviewing the troops and Freeman's character is standing in the ranks.  Shaw is riding by on horseback.  The two men lock eyes and their heads slightly nod as they ackowledge each other.  Freeman's nod to Broderick is the coolest thing in the movie at least to me.  It lets us know that he is not easily scared or panicked.  It serves him well later on in the film.As for Matthew Broderick (Colonel Shaw), I believe that this is the best film he's ever done.  He gave a wonderful performance as the leader of an all black unit.  Broderick does a fine job of letting us see Shaw trying to find a way to communicate with his men and trying to figure out how to train men that will probably never get to fight like the white units do.  I believe due to the subject matter, all parties tried to give it the proper respect and honor to the real soldiers of the 54th.Frankly, I think all the performances were on target.  Even the costuming department went through great pains to get the uniforms exactly as they were back then.Denzel Wahington's finest scene is probably the whipping scene.  His character, private Tripp, leave the camp to find shoes so that he can fight.  Instead he finds himself charged as a deserter and is sentenced to be whipped in front of his unit.  His shirt is remove and reveals that he has already beat beaten many times with the scars from the whip to prove it.  In defiance, his stifles any screams that might escape from his throat while being beaten and instead, lets one tear roll down his cheek.  The timing of that one tear just as the music swells to the crescendo is pure genius.  Also noteworthy as this film unfolds are the relationships that develop between these three men.Unforunately, everyone in the 54th unit dies (in the movie anyway) and it always makes me sad that my favorite characters don't survive.  Shaw and Tripp who were at such odds in the beginnig of the movie are buried together in a mass grave at the end of the movie.  I had never heard the story of the 54th nor had I known that there was an all black unit anywhere.  I'm glad the movie brought the story to light.This movie is a must see!",5,We need more stars!!!,1125100800,"08 27, 2005",2005,2797,"['What', 'disappointment', 'were', ""n't"", 'more', 'oscars', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'what', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'should', 'receive', 'awards', 'just', 'breathing', 'phenominal', 'Just', 'think', 'talent', 'going', 'waste', 'kids', 'show', 'electric', 'company', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'best', 'scene', 'probably', 'when', 'Shaw', 'second', 'time', 'first', 'time', 'meet', 'just', 'battle', 'where', 'Shaw', 'wounded', 'laying', 'ground', 'unconcious', 'Freeman', 'character', 'Shaw', 'see', 'still', 'alive', 'was', 'grave', 'digger', 'second', 'time', 'lay', 'eyes', 'other', 'Shaw', 'reviewing', 'troops', 'Freeman', 'character', 'standing', 'ranks', 'Shaw', 'riding', 'horseback', 'two', 'men', 'lock', 'eyes', 'heads', 'slightly', 'nod', 'ackowledge', 'other', 'Freeman', 'nod', 'Broderick', 'coolest', 'thing', 'movie', 'least', 'know', 'not', 'easily', 'scared', 'panicked', 'well', 'later', 'film.As', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Colonel', 'Shaw', 'believe', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'done', 'gave', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'leader', 'black', 'unit', 'Broderick', 'fine', 'job', 'letting', 'see', 'Shaw', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'communicate', 'men', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'train', 'men', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'get', 'fight', 'white', 'units', 'do', 'believe', 'due', 'subject', 'matter', 'parties', 'tried', 'give', 'proper', 'respect', 'honor', 'real', 'soldiers', '54th.Frankly', 'think', 'performances', 'were', 'target', 'Even', 'costuming', 'department', 'went', 'great', 'pains', 'get', 'uniforms', 'exactly', 'were', 'back', 'then.Denzel', 'Wahington', 'finest', 'scene', 'probably', 'whipping', 'scene', 'character', 'private', 'Tripp', 'leave', 'camp', 'find', 'shoes', 'so', 'can', 'fight', 'Instead', 'charged', 'deserter', 'sentenced', 'be', 'whipped', 'front', 'unit', 'shirt', 'remove', 'reveals', 'already', 'beat', 'beaten', 'many', 'times', 'scars', 'whip', 'prove', 'defiance', 'stifles', 'screams', 'might', 'escape', 'throat', 'being', 'beaten', 'instead', 'one', 'tear', 'roll', 'down', 'cheek', 'timing', 'one', 'tear', 'just', 'music', 'crescendo', 'pure', 'genius', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'film', 'unfolds', 'are', 'relationships', 'develop', 'three', 'men.Unforunately', 'everyone', '54th', 'unit', 'dies', 'movie', 'anyway', 'always', 'sad', 'favorite', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'survive', 'Shaw', 'Tripp', 'who', 'were', 'such', 'odds', 'beginnig', 'movie', 'are', 'buried', 'together', 'mass', 'grave', 'end', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'story', '54th', 'had', 'known', 'was', 'black', 'unit', 'anywhere', ""'m"", 'glad', 'movie', 'brought', 'story', 'light.This', 'movie', 'must', 'see']",N/A

This film centers around the African-American Massachusetts regiment that became the first to fight in the Union army.  These were men who were only too eager to fight against  the hated Confederacy, but who also needed the education to become  soldiers.Their leader is Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), who  is chosen to manage this ""project"".  Cary Elwes is his friend, a major who  had a more difficult time adjusting to new troops.  Morgan Freeman plays  one soldier who possesses the maturity and leadership for this unit, Andre  Braugher (the great Frank Pembleton from ""Homicide: Life on the Street"") is  a free Massachusetts black man who volunteers for the regiment faces some  uncomfortable changes both inside and outside himself.  And then there is  Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance as one stubborn soldier who  is as difficult as can be, but becomes a soldier worthy of his  unit.Directed by the brilliant Edward Zwick, Glory features a cast and  crew that managed to excel at everything.  James Horner's score mixed with  the Harlem Boys Choir's voices, melt with the images on the screen of  troops that were ready to sacrifice everything for their cause. Perhaps  above all is Freddie Francis' cinematography.  His photography, whether of  battle, the troops themselves, or the overall atmosphere of war, brings the  audience into this film with a spirit that is rare.There have always  been some grumblings about Broderick as the choice to play an Army Colonel,  but he plays Shaw with maturity and poise.  The rest of the cast are all  terrific, and all deliver excellent performances.This is truly a film to  watch again and again, to see the horrors of the Civil War, and the heroism  of African-Americans ready for battle, and the bravery of the white leaders  that led them there.Vote: 10",5,"A story of bravery and honor, beautifully told",957484800,"05 5, 2000",2000,1873,"['truly', 'breathtaking', 'historical', 'drama', 'film', 'centers', 'African-American', 'Massachusetts', 'regiment', 'became', 'first', 'fight', 'Union', 'army', 'were', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'only', 'too', 'eager', 'fight', 'hated', 'Confederacy', 'who', 'also', 'needed', 'education', 'become', 'soldiers.Their', 'leader', 'Col.', 'Robert', 'Gould', 'Shaw', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'who', 'chosen', 'manage', 'project', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'friend', 'major', 'who', 'had', 'more', 'difficult', 'time', 'adjusting', 'new', 'troops', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'one', 'soldier', 'who', 'maturity', 'leadership', 'unit', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'great', 'Frank', 'Pembleton', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'free', 'Massachusetts', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'regiment', 'uncomfortable', 'changes', 'then', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'one', 'stubborn', 'soldier', 'who', 'as', 'difficult', 'can', 'be', 'soldier', 'worthy', 'unit.Directed', 'brilliant', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'Glory', 'cast', 'crew', 'managed', 'excel', 'everything', 'James', 'Horner', 'score', 'mixed', 'Harlem', 'Boys', 'Choir', 'voices', 'melt', 'images', 'screen', 'troops', 'were', 'ready', 'sacrifice', 'everything', 'cause', 'Perhaps', 'Freddie', 'Francis', 'cinematography', 'photography', 'battle', 'troops', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'war', 'audience', 'film', 'spirit', 'rare.There', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'grumblings', 'about', 'Broderick', 'choice', 'play', 'Army', 'Colonel', 'Shaw', 'maturity', 'poise', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'terrific', 'deliver', 'excellent', 'performances.This', 'truly', 'film', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'see', 'horrors', 'Civil', 'War', 'heroism', 'African-Americans', 'ready', 'battle', 'bravery', 'white', 'leaders', 'led', 'there.Vote', '10']",N/A

This cinematic masterpiece traces the founding and short-lived career of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first &quot;all-black&quot; volunteer regiment in the Union army. (By law, all officers had to be white.)Matthew Broderick stars as the 54th Regiment's commanding officer, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw.  Already a grizzled veteran of a the battle of Antietam at the tender age of 24, Shaw is offered command of the new all-volunteer regiment of black soldiers. He accepts the risky officer, enlists the aid of his friend, Cabot Forbes, and begins to recruit runaway slaves and northern &quot;freemen&quot; to join the regiment.Much of the movie chronicles the 54th regiment's struggle to become a credible fighting force.  It's a struggle made nearly impossible by the institutional ineptitude of the Union army and the racial bigotry of many of its officers.  The newly recruited black soldiers want nothing more than to fight; the army brass sees them as nothing more than a political expedient and a laughable experiment, capable of nothing more than digging ditches and clearing forests.  Against these odds, Shaw, with the help of Forbes and the irascible, bigoted Irishman, Sergeant Major Mulcahy, manages to turn his ragtag band of soldiers into a cohesive fighting unit.  How the 54th Massachusettes Regiment fares in its first major engagement - the assault upon Battery Wagner in 1863 - forms the beautiful climactic event of this film.Matthew Broderick moves away from his usual fluffy, comedic roles (i.e., Ferris Bueller,) and successfully proves himself a serious actor capable of bringing maturity and depth to his role as Colonel Shaw. Denzel Washington's marvelous portrayal as the embittered, cynical runaway slave Trip earned him an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor. Cary Elwes is less successful in his role as the irresponsible and sometimes insubordinate Major Cabot Forbes.  His acting seemed a bit &quot;over the top&quot; at times.  Excellent performances are also turned in by Morgan Freeman (Sergeant Major Rawlins), Andre Braugher (Thomas Searles), John Finn (Sergeant Major Mulcahy), and Jihmi Kennedy (Jupiter Sharts).&quot;Glory's&quot; cinematography is breathtaking throughout.  The screenplay is powerfully lyrical in its beauty, and James Horner's beautifully haunting musical score adds a tremendous depth of emotion to an already powerfully evocative film.&quot;Glory&quot; is a sumptuously produced and well acted movie, a sure bet to please all fans of a good war movie.

Unfortunately, it was hampered by two sets  of negative criticism: one which held the film should have been entirely  about the African-American soldiers of the 54th Massachusetts, and not at  all about their white officers; and one which said Matthew Broderick lacked  the authority to be a believable military commander. Both schools of  thought are ridiculous beyond words. What Glory celebrates is our common  humanity, particularly the bond between soldiers fighting together for the  sake of freedom; this is, in fact, the entire point of the film, and it  would be impossible to depict if either whites or blacks were  supernumeraries. As for Matthew Broderick's performance, for me his  boyishness adds to its power. His character is a pampered young man from a  privileged background who must, in a time of national emergency, become a  leader of men, and Broderick is the perfect actor to play such a character.  For me, this film goes almost beyond praise.  The performances--not only  Broderick's but also Denzel Washington's, Morgan Freeman's and Andre  Braugher's--rank among the greatest of that decade; the battle scenes are  played for maximum suspense and emotional impact; the cinematography of  Freddie Francis is blazingly brilliant.

It is still a great and moving story now, even after 45-odd viewings.Base on the true story of the Union's raising of the 54th Mass. Infantry, ""Glory"" takes the viewer into the life and Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. As the commanding officer of the 54th, he has to deal with many obstacles, including indifference amoung the army at large, out-right racism and supply problems sponsored by that racism.

Denzel WAshington is deservedly well-praised for his role as a bitter, hate-filled runaway who finds belonging in the ranks of the 54th. Thomas, Colonel Shaw's childhood friend, develops from one who tries to keep his old ties alive, to a soldier who knows his place in the army. Morgan Freeman shines also as the Regiment Sergeant Major, the glue that holds the men together and keeps them out of trouble many a time.Matthew Broderick was a surprise casting choice, and perhaps was not the best for the role, in my opinion. He comes across as a bit soft and pliable for a man who had to overcome such opposition and institutionalised bigotry. Perhaps the real Colonel Shaw was deceptively soft?Everything else about this movie was near perfect, from the acting, locations and music to the action and depth of the tale being told.

Rounding out the cast are Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington, the two finest actors of ANY color working in Hollywood these days, and Cary Elwes in easily his best performance since The Princess Bride.

When Broderick is offered the command of the regiment his reaction is worth seeing again, not to mention the initial reaction of Cary Elwes when he is offered the post of second in command. As for the character he is depicting, Broderick is about the same age - mid-20s so I think it gives a good feel for what Shaw would have experienced as a young regimental commander.The making of a disparate group of young black men; some educated to a level equal to the officers and others with little if any formal education is insightful.  The training these men endured is well depicted and accurate.Denzel Washington as a cynical young black is outstanding.  Perhaps he was drawing on some of his own experiences in life as he made the charecter come alive.  His resistance to Broderick in the matter of the flag is extremely powerful.There are a few down sides, small but worth noting for the record.  At the time of his death Shaw was married; this is never mentioned and would have made quite an impact on the story line.  Jane Alexander as his mother is fine but maybe the impact of his parents might have been further highlighted.  These are the main points and don't really detract - they are jmust points that would have made the film more interesting.Look at the comparison between the 54th and the locally recruited freed slaves they meet in South Carolina.  There is a bit of culture shock for both sides.The climactic battle is exceptional in it's depiction of the assault on the fort and the casualties the regiment suffered. The burial scene is quite moving.Throughout the film the music is a constant presence and enhances an already excellent film to even great heights.The film is a must for anyone with an interest in the Civil War or leadership under conflict and stress.

On the surface, it's the historical telling of the Union's first all-black regiment, the 54th Massachusetts, and its role in the War Between the States (or, as my southern friends refer to it, &quot;The Late Unpleasantness&quot;). Beneath the gritty surface, finely woven strands of discord intertwine. There's the unease between the new regiment and its bigoted Union counterparts (led by Cary Elwes, thoroughly unlikeable in a fine performance), and the tension and distrust amid the former slaves themselves, as crystallized in two excellent performances (what else is new?) by Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. Freeman, as Sgt. Major Rawlins, butts heads with Washington's bitter Trip in a battle for the minds and allegiances of their fellow soldiers. Self-determination is at the heart of this latter-day morality play, and the issues--particularly those broached by Freeman's character--are still pertinent today. Freddie Francis won an Oscar for his cinematography. The film is visually stunning, with horrific battle sequences. Excellent Grammy-winning score by James Horner. Denzel won a Best Supporting Oscar; too bad Morgan couldn't have received one as well. Matthew Broderick also gives a fine performance as the 54th's leader, Col. Shaw.

160585,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0800102150,Reviewer,"[3, 3]","Even as the Civil War was being fought, it was history in the making, and one of it's many chapters involved a stretch of beach on a peninsula in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, where in July of 1863, the Confederates had ensconced themselves in the strategically prominent Fort Wagner.  And the Federal command had determined that it must be taken at all costs.  But it would be a veritable suicide mission for the regiment that served as the vanguard of the assault; therefore, volunteers were called upon, rather than being chosen arbitrarily by the General in command.  At this point, a young Colonel from Boston, Robert Gould Shaw, stepped forward to offer his regiment, the 54th Massachusetts Infantry, the first unit comprised of black soldiers in the history of the U.S. Army, for the job.  ""Glory,"" directed by Edward Zwick, is their story.Soon after President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, the Army was opened up to blacks; and the first to respond were those who ultimately made up the 54th.  Shaw, an abolitionist, was approached about taking command, and he accepted, putting his beliefs on the line and determining to make real soldiers of these men.  And he did.  In the beginning, however, he had no idea of the formidable task awaiting them in the not too distant future, when they would face an enemy bastion that was heavily fortified, well manned and which maintained a decidedly advantageous position geographically.  But leading up to that, Shaw had his men trained properly and stood by them as they formed the bonds amongst themselves that ultimately saw them through the battles they had to fight, on the field and off.  It was rough going; but under Shaw's command, they were able to secure something they had never had in their lives-- dignity as human beings.Going into this project, director Zwick was adamant about adhering to historical accuracy in all areas of the story, from the events themselves, to the smallest, seemingly insignificant details they would put on the screen.  And he succeeded.  When the soldiers of the 54th, for example, are informed that their pay would be ten dollars a month, minus three dollars for clothing expenses-- seven real dollars pay-- instead of the thirteen they had been promised (which was the pay the white soldiers received), Shaw and his officers, in a show of solidarity, tear up their own pay envelopes and refuse to accept their wages until their men get their full pay.  The battles, as well, from Antietam to Fort Wagner, are authentically represented.  The assault on Fort Wagner, especially, seems like an almost romantic notion of gallantry, but the fact that if happened just as depicted here makes it all the more involving.  Zwick painstakingly recreated every aspect of the battle, and sets it up geographically and in such a way that the viewer is able to anticipate, without getting lost as the action unfolds.  The outcome of the battle is, of course, a matter of historic record, and especially for those well versed in the history of the Civil War, this film should be an entirely satisfying experience.Matthew Broderick gives an engaging, understated performance as Shaw that  captures the essence of the man, whom we get to know initially through his own words, from the letters he wrote home during his time in the Army (which are now kept in the Houghton Library at Harvard University).  The film begins, in fact, with one of Shaw's letters being read over the action.  Throughout the film, Zwick uses this method to move the story along, as well as to give some real insight into Shaw, and through his thoughts, the men of the 54th and the events in which they are engaged.  And Broderick seems to embody the man you picture as being the author of the words being read.  He portrays Shaw, not as a cinematic, John Wayne type superhero, but heroic in a very real sense; as he leads his men against Fort Wagner, you see a man obviously afraid, but determined to uphold his principles and ideals, for which he is willing to die.  It's not a flashy role, but Broderick, by creating a character to whom virtually everyone will be able to relate and sympathize, is clearly the strength and the star of the film.There are a number of outstanding performances in supporting roles, also, particularly Denzel Washington, who received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Trip, the embittered former slave who is at war, not only with the Confederates, but with life.  Trip is a complex character, and Washington gets to his soul, awakening the bitterness as well as the somewhat caustic humor with which he wages his daily battles.  From the first scene in which he appears, Washington dominates the screen, even in the scenes in which Trip is not the center of attention.  It's a powerful performance, without question deserving of the Award.  Morgan Freeman gives a memorable performance, as well, as Sergeant Major John Rawlins, the elder statesmen of the 54th, who in his way sets an example for the younger soldiers, and eventually even Trip.  Also worthy of mention are Andre Braugher, as Thomas, and Jihmi Kennedy as Jupiter Sharts.The supporting cast includes Cary Elwes (Major Forbes), John Finn (Mulcahy), Donovan Leitch (Morse), Bob Gunton (Harker), Cliff De Young (Montgomery) and Jay O. Sanders (General Strong).  Beginning with an accurate and insightful screenplay (by Kevin Jarre), Zwick uses all the tools at his disposal, including great cinematography (by Freddie Francis, who received the Oscar) and some memorable performances, to deliver an unforgettable and historically significant film.  Zwick is to be commended for the honesty of this film, and for maintaining the integrity of the story, which he never embellished simply for dramatic effect, which simply wasn't necessary; the drama that the 54th Massachusetts played out in real life was enough.  And that is what Zwick presents, in ""Glory.""",5,Outstanding Perfromances by Broderick and Washington,992563200,"06 15, 2001",2001,5945,"['Even', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'being', 'fought', 'was',

Crawford,"[4, 5]","This is one of those films with such a depth to it that you can see it many times and always see greater nuance in its message and characters.  I do not think that I have ever been so moved by any other war film, and it is a historical record, not fiction, of a decisive turning point.In this, you witness a number of men who choose to fight in one of the defining wars of the 19C.  There is Captain Shaw, who receives the commission of colonel to lead the first regiment of African Americans in the Civil War.  With the ardor and fear of talented youth, he takes on this challenge, in the face of prejudice and ridicule from his fellow officers, and enters history as he grows into a man.  It is a dazzling and subtle portrait, anchored in history and his personal flowering; yet he is a flawed character and makes many mistakes.  Nothing in this is romanticised or exaggerated.Then there are the men Shaw leads, most of them wounded and stunted by the crime that was slavery.  Denzel Washington is amazing as the enlisted man who emerges from anger at his terrible slave past - without family, without friends or education - to become a genuine hero in his own way; his growth is a deeply moving journey, completely believable.  The same can be said of Morgan Freeman, who also shows incredible potential to grow into respect for himself as a man and later a leader, courageous yet humble.  There are many other similar characters, each unique and superbly acted.Shaw struggles first with himself - his priviledged ease and inexperience, his yearning for the aristocratic life he has left behind - and then with the bureaucracy and its prejudices and racist arrogance against his men, who want to prove themselves in battle yet are held back.  At the end of the film, in perhaps a precognition of his fate, he looks at the landscape with sadness and then does his duty.

160593,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0800102150,Robert Morris,"[4, 5]","Until I first saw this film about fifteen years ago, I was unaware of the Massachusetts 54th Colored Infantry regiment which led the attack on what proved to be an impregnable Fort Wagner (near Charleston) on July 10 and 11, 1863. The all-black, all-volunteer 54th was led by Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. He was among the 351 killed during the attack, all but 12 of them wearing a blue uniform. Previously, there was a widespread belief among many whites that blacks would never be able to accept military discipline. The 54th proved them wrong. Many of these same whites doubted that blacks could and would have sufficient courage when engaged in combat. The 54th proved them wrong.FYI, about 75 years later, African-American fighter pilots in the 332nd Fighter Group -- in the then segregated U.S. military services, including the Army Air Corps -- flew P-51 Mustangs in support of B-17 and B-24 bombers during dozens of runs to/from Germany...and ""The Tuskegee Airmen"" never lost a single bomber entrusted to their care.Directed by Edward Zwick with a style that in some respects invites comparisons with John Ford, Glory focuses on the process by which Shaw (Matthew Broderick) gradually develops the leadership and management skills needed to prepare the 54th both mentally and physically for battle and, meanwhile, to overcome the resistance, indeed the hostility to the 54th among other Union officers and troops. Shaw was the 26-year old scion of a white aristocrat family in Boston.  Marshall Herskovitz and Kevin Jarre's screenplay is an adaptation of Lincoln Kirsten's Lay This Laurel and Peter Buchard's One Gallant Rush. Although the focus of the narrative is primarily on Shaw, our attention is attracted to Morgan Freeman whose John Rawlins (the 54th's elder statesman) is reminiscent to me of roles he played later, notably as Ned Logan in Unforgiven (1992), ""Red"" Redding in The Shawshank Redemption (1994), and William Somerset in Seven (1995).In what proved to be a breakthrough role as Trip (a fugitive slave), Denzel Washington dominates almost every scene in which he appears. He later received an Academy Award for actor in a supporting role. All of the other members of the cast are also first-rate. (Yes, that's Jane Alexander appearing briefly but effectively as Shaw's abolitionist mother.) Special credit to James Horner (musical score) and Freddie Francis (cinematography) for their contributions to what must have been an especially difficult film to produce. In the final sequence, Shaw leads his troops into battle. The subsequent carnage recently came to mind as I observed another scene, early on in Cold Mountain, during which underground munitions are placed and then detonated. As in Glory, the carnage is almost incomprehensible.Special features provided with the DVD version of Glory include a ""Commentary"" by director Edward Zwick, Morgan Freeman and Matthew Broderick; an exclusive featurette, ""The Voices of Glory""; a documentary, ""The True Nature of Glory Continues"" narrated by Morgan Freeman; an ""Original Featurette,"" deleted scenes, and ""Talent Files"" (Edward Zwick, Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman and Cary Elwes).",5,What Color Is Courage?,1079049600,"03 12, 2004",2004,3181,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'unaware', 'Massachusetts', '54th', 'Colored', 'Infantry', 'regiment', 'led', 'attack', 'what', 'proved', 'be', 'impregnable', 'Fort', 'Wagner', 'Charleston', 'July', '10', '11', '1863', 'all-black', 'all-volunteer', '54th', 'was', 'led', 'Colonel', 'Robert', 'Gould', 'Shaw', 'was', '351', 'killed', 'attack', '12', 'wearing', 'blue', 'uniform', 'Previously', 'was', 'widespread', 'belief', 'many', 'whites', 'blacks', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'accept', 'military', 'discipline', '54th', 'proved', 'wrong', 'Many', 'same', 'whites', 'doubted', 'blacks', 'could', 'would', 'have', 'sufficient', 'courage', 'when', 'engaged', 'combat', '54th', 'proved', 'wrong.FYI', 'about', '75', 'years', 'later', 'African-American', 'fighter', 'pilots', '332nd', 'Fighter', 'Group', 'then', 'segregated', 'U.S.', 'military', 'services', 'including', 'Army', 'Air', 'Corps', 'flew', 'P-51', 'Mustangs', 'support', 'B-17', 'B-24', 'bombers', 'dozens', 'runs', 'Germany', 'Tuskegee', 'Airmen', 'never', 'lost', 'single', 'bomber', 'entrusted', 'care.Directed', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'style', 'respects', 'invites', 'comparisons', 'John', 'Ford', 'Glory', 'process', 'Shaw', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'gradually', 'leadership', 'management', 'skills', 'needed', 'prepare', '54th', 'mentally', 'physically', 'battle', 'meanwhile', 'overcome', 'resistance', 'indeed', 'hostility', '54th', 'other', 'Union', 'officers', 'troops', 'Shaw', 'was', '26-year', 'old', 'scion', 'white', 'aristocrat', 'family', 'Boston', 'Marshall', 'Herskovitz', 'Kevin', 'Jarre', 'screenplay', 'adaptation', 'Lincoln', 'Kirsten', 'Lay', 'Laurel', 'Peter', 'Buchard', 'One', 'Gallant', 'Rush', 'focus', 'narrative', 'primarily', 'Shaw', 'attention', 'attracted', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'John', 'Rawlins', '54th', 'elder', 'statesman', 'reminiscent', 'roles', 'played', 'later', 'notably', 'Ned', 'Logan', 'Unforgiven', '1992', 'Red', 'Redding', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', '1994', 'William', 'Somerset', 'Seven', '1995', '.In', 'what', 'proved', 'be', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'Trip', 'fugitive', 'slave', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'almost', 'scene', 'later', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'actor', 'supporting', 'role', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'are', 'also', 'first-rate', 'Yes', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'appearing', 'briefly', 'effectively', 'Shaw', 'abolitionist', 'mother', 'Special', 'credit', 'James', 'Horner', 'musical', 'score', 'Freddie', 'Francis', 'cinematography', 'contributions', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'especially', 'difficult', 'film', 'produce', 'final', 'sequence', 'Shaw', 'troops', 'battle', 'subsequent', 'carnage', 'recently', 'came', 'mind', 'observed', 'scene', 'early', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'underground', 'munitions', 'are', 'placed', 'then', 'detonated', 'Glory', 'carnage', 'almost', 'incomprehensible.Special', 'features', 'provided', 'DVD', 'version', 'Glory', 'include', 'Commentary', 'director', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'exclusive', 'featurette', 'Voices', 'Glory', 'documentary', 'True', 'Nature', 'Glory', 'Continues', 'narrated', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Original', 'Featurette', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Talent', 'Files', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Cary', 'Elwes']",N/A

160595,A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,0800102150,Rocco Dormarunno,"[6, 7]","For so long, the image of the Civil War has existed in the collective American mind as a series of sepia-tone Matthew Brady photographs: ghoulish and nightmarish landscapes littered with bodies and body parts. However, with the notable exceptions of his portraits of the field generals, there is a sort of anonymity to the corpses in Brady's works. In one of GONE WITH THE WIND's most powerful scenes, scores upon scores of wounded soldiers lie in the streets, until they appear to be one large, unidentifiable mass of pain--which was the filmmaker's point. Edward Zwick's GLORY was one of the first films to put a human face and individuality to those who fought and died in America's most brutal years. Based upon the true story of Boston's young colonel, Robert Shaw, and his efforts to allow his all African-American outfit (the &quot;54th&quot;) to fight on the side of the Union, GLORY is one of those rare films that successfully combines history with movie-making.Wonderful performances abound in this powerful film: Washington, Broderick, Freeman and Elwes all give their best efforts. But the real star of the show is the camera. The battle sequences, as other reviewers have mentioned, are horrific, as is the scene in the triage tent. (THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH WEAK STOMACHS.) But the scenes in between, the relatively quiet ones, have as great an impact. I especially have in mind the training sequences. In another director's hands, the scenes in which the troops begin understanding each other, and as the officers begin understanding their troops could have wound up a syrupy mess. Instead, their horrible predicament unites them in an unsentimental, yet sensitive manner. Zwick's camera-work throughout is exemplary, making GLORY one of the best films about America's most tragic episodes.",5,American tragedy,1087344000,"06 16, 2004",2004,1815,"['so', 'long', 'image', 'Civil', 'War', 'existed', 'collective', 'American', 'mind', 'series', 'sepia-tone', 'Matthew', 'Brady', 'photographs', 'ghoulish', 'nightmarish', 'landscapes', 'littered', 'bodies', 'body', 'parts', 'However', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'portraits', 'field', 'generals', 'sort', 'anonymity', 'corpses', 'Brady', 'works', 'one', 'GONE', 'WITH', 'THE', 'WIND', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'scores', 'scores', 'wounded', 'soldiers', 'lie', 'streets', 'appear', 'be', 'one', 'large', 'unidentifiable', 'mass', 'pain', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'point', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'GLORY', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'put', 'human', 'face', 'individuality', 'who', 'fought', 'died', 'America', 'most', 'brutal', 'years', 'Based', 'true', 'story', 'Boston', 'young', 'colonel', 'Robert', 'Shaw', 'efforts', 'allow', 'African-American', 'outfit', 'quot', '54th', 'quot', 'fight', 'side', 'Union', 'GLORY', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'successfully', 'history', 'movie-making.Wonderful', 'performances', 'abound', 'powerful', 'film', 'Washington', 'Broderick', 'Freeman', 'Elwes', 'give', 'best', 'efforts', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'camera', 'battle', 'sequences', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'are', 'horrific', 'scene', 'triage', 'tent', 'THIS', 'MOVIE', 'NOT', 'FOR', 'PEOPLE', 'WITH', 'WEAK', 'STOMACHS', 'scenes', 'relatively', 'quiet', 'ones', 'have', 'as', 'great', 'impact', 'especially', 'have', 'mind', 'training', 'sequences', 'director', 'hands', 'scenes', 'troops', 'begin', 'understanding', 'other', 'officers', 'begin', 'understanding', 'troops', 'could', 'have', 'wound', 'up', 'syrupy', 'mess', 'Instead', 'horrible', 'predicament', 'unsentimental', 'yet', 'sensitive', 'manner', 'Zwick', 'camera-work', 'exemplary', 'making', 'GLORY', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'America', 'most', 'tragic', 'episodes']",N/A

Volunteers was the first uniformed black regiment to fight in the Civil War.  The story here is wonderfully told, and the film pulls no punches about the prejudice and adversity that the soldiers of the 54th had to endure in order to get what white soldiers took for granted--acceptance by the rest of the Army as the fighting men that they were.The 54th was officered by white soldiers, and here Matthew Broderick puts in a fine performance as the Colonel of the regiment.  His eventual bonding with the men, and the mutual respect that gradually develops as the regiment congeals into a well-trained fighting force, is wonderfully done and quite inspirational.  Morgan Freeman does his customary stellar job as the regimental Sergeant Major, to whom the Colonel comes to look for insights about leadership and the problems of the men.  Denzel Washington (disclosure: this is one of my favorite actors) plays a signficant role as Private Trip, who enlists out of pride and the desire to prove he is the equal of anyone.  Trip refuses to accept the lesser pay afforded to black soldiers. White soldiers were paid $13/month, black soldiers $10.  It is a historical fact that many black soldiers refused to accept the $10, or any pay at all, until Congress eventually corrected this outrage.  The rest of the cast was quite good as well.The battle scenes in this film are incredibly good--in my opinion this sets the standard for how a battle should be done in a film.  The action never takes precedence over the plot, but I was quite literally absorbed by the intensity and the drama of both the first skirmish in which the regiment is blooded, and the later major assault in which the regiment is given the (nearly suicidal) lead position.This is a big budget film, and deserves every one of its five stars.  It features an inspiring story, excellent acting, lots of action, and realistic sets and battles.  What more can one ask?

Shaw and throwing him in the trench in the saddest part of the  movie we see almost all of the 54th have lost there lives.If you do  not cry at or at leat think the ending of Glory is sad then you don't know  what sacrifice is.A truly moving and heroic masterpeice one of the best  movies of the milleniuum.By ross",5,Glory - DVD,947203200,"01 7, 2000",2000,3166,"['Quite', 'frankly', 'best', 'Civil', 'War', 'drama', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'best', 'war', 'movies', 'ever', 'made.When', 'see', 'DVD', 'version', 'even', 'preview', 'grips', 'hooked', 'truly', 'epic', 'vison', 'Edward', 'Zwick.The', 'film', 'shines', 'brand', 'new', 'film', 'DVD', 'cinamatography', 'incredable', 'score', 'James', 'Horner', 'monumental.The', 'story', 'Col.Robert', 'Gould', 'Shaw', 'leading', 'union', 'soldiers', 'important', 'victory', 'war.When', 'back', 'haunted', 'memories', 'battle.He', 'given', 'assignment', 'command', 'group', 'African', 'American', 'soldiers', 'battle.One', 'who', 'played', 'remarkable', 'realizm', 'slave', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance.Robert', 'accepts', '54th', 'mistrusted', 'Union', 'soldiers.The', '54th', 'first', 'are', 'given', 'proclamation', 'give', 'will', 'be', 'punished', 'severly.But', 'one', 'meraculous', 'scene', 'movie', 'stay', 'hopes', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'defend', 'there', 'country', 'die', 'battlefeild.But', 'meet', 'General', 'who', 'seemingly', 'bent', 'useing', 'manual', 'labor', 'not', 'giving', 'chance', 'fight.Robert', 'demands', 'union', 'soldiers', 'be', 'able', 'fight.In', 'first', 'battle', 'do', 'almost', 'superb', 'bearly', 'casultys', 'proving', 'have', 'what', 'go', 'war.The', 'next', 'morning', 'Genral', 'Robert', '54th', 'main', 'opposition', 'stronghold', 'FT.Wagner', 'almost', 'invincible', 'fortress', 'heavily', 'armed.Col.Robert', 'will', 'lead', 'army', 'first', 'attact', 'fort', 'even', 'knowing', 'price', 'soldiers', 'will', 'most', 'ceartainly', 'be', 'death.The', 'morning', 'Col.', 'Robert', 'readys', 'men', 'battle', 'finally', 'see', 'soldiers', 'have', 'earned', 'respect', 'union', 'soldiers.Robert', 'tell', 'reporter', 'should', 'fall', 'remember', 'what', 'saw', 'here', 'today', 'most', 'powerful', 'line', 'movies', 'was', 'Robert', 'telling', 'one', 'person', 'should', 'fall', 'who', 'will', 'carry', 'flag.The', 'final', 'battle', 'scene', 'Wagner', 'heartwrenching', 'heroic', 'bravery.We', 'see', 'fire', 'what', 'soliders', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'wa', ""n't"", 'continue', 'one', 'best', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'made.We', 'see', 'charging', 'fort', 'men', 'dying', 'horribly.Shaw', 'remain', 'trench.When', 'Shaw', 'make', 'attack', 'killed', 'gunfire', 'most', 'harrowing', 'scene', 'hole', 'movie', 'one', 'soliers', 'up', 'fallen', 'flag', 'make', 'brave', 'charge', 'fort', 'see', 'men', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'soldiers', 'MEN.James', 'Horner', 'score', 'incredable', 'scene', 'not', 'let', 'up.As', 'men', 'race', 'take', 'fort', 'still', 'heavy', 'casuiltys', 'are', 'horribly', 'met', 'entrence', 'confederate', 'soldiers', 'killing', 'final', 'scene', 'see', 'confederate', 'soldiers', 'lifting', 'body', 'Col.', 'Shaw', 'throwing', 'trench', 'saddest', 'part', 'movie', 'see', 'almost', '54th', 'have', 'lost', 'lives.If', 'do', 'not', 'cry', 'leat', 'think', 'ending', 'Glory', 'sad', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'sacrifice', 'is.A', 'truly', 'moving', 'heroic', 'masterpeice', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'milleniuum.By', 'ross']",N/A

It gallantly shows that the  Americans of African descent that fought in that regiment or as it would be  any other regiment were indeed worthy to fight for their freedom.(And for  human decency and sanity! ) It showed just how asinine an idea of slavery  really was. The comradery displayed by the actors who played the few  soldiers focused on in the regiment really added to the impact of the  story. The tension between this band of brave souls was released at  precisely the right moments and enhanced by the tear jerking score by James  Horner. The horrors of war that these men would face would bring them  closer together. It is understood why &quot;war buddies&quot; sometimes  stay friends forever or if lost are never forgotten. For me the outstanding  way the battle scenes looked and sounded was definitely worthy of praise  but the acting by Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Matthew Broderick, and  everyone in the cast is what makes this such a great film. It was a great  team effort. Nobody really stood out as having a poor performance. Nobody  seemed disinterested in their work.

Lincoln credited these brave soldiers for turning the tide of the war for the Union victory. Glory is also the most realistic of the Civil War films - Gettysburg is a good film, though it's obvious the actor's are wearing fake beards, and there's a questionable blank spot to the whereabouts of Jeb Stuart in the film, never explained. Gods And Generals, is a long and boring film, and most disappointing is Robert Duvalls role as Lee, it's not Duvall's always superb acting, but the lack of, strictly a cameo role for Duvall... Glory is a classic wartime epic not only for history, this film is a milestone achievement for the entire motion picture industry, worthy of watching over and over again, superb acting, spectacular cinematography, close to accurate story/screenplay, although a little stingy on the battle scenes, the explosive grand finale makes up for it leaving the viewer stunned.

160607,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,0800102150,Sean Pasek,"[0, 0]","Glory is one of the most powerful war films ever made as well as one of my all-time favorite films.  And the quote given by Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, ""If I should fall, remember what you see here,"" speaks volumes for the courage and bravery of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment as well as for all Negro soldiers who have ever served in the military to fight for this country.Aptly titled, ""Glory"" references the impact that these men had upon history.  It doesn't matter that they were unsuccessful in taking Fort Wagner.  What matters is that in that assault, they earned the respect of many of the white soldiers and men who witnessed their courageous attempt.  Why is this so pivotal?  Because during that time period, even their white allies viewed the Negro soldier as being useless in a fight.  Remember that most people felt that they were largely inferior.  The assault on Fort Wagner proved them wrong, and at least, this began a change in views about the value of Negro soldiers, in not only the Civil War, but in subsequent wars that followed.Matthew Broderick leads and all-star cast as Robert Gould Shaw in this epic film about a young, white abolitionist from Boston who is offered command of the 54th Massachusetts regiment...one of the first all-Negro regiments to serve in the Civil War for the Union.  Shaw initially shows his inexperience as a commanding officer.  He makes mistakes, but he is quickly able to win the hearts of the men he commands.  His ideal is in the right place, as he tries to not only train them, but to understand them.  Even many of his officers don't believe that the 54th will ever see combat.  Shaw feels that it is his duty to prepare them, and prepare them properly, as evidenced in a wonderful scene in which he chews out his best friend and XO, Major Forbes, for not teaching the men how to use a rifle properly.Denzel Washington, who earned a well-deserved supporting actor Oscar, plays a runaway slave, Trip, who embodies the heart and soul of the regiment.  He's an angry man, and one can hardly blame him once we see the wounds on his back from repeated beatings.  He's full of anger and hatred, and he desperately wants to fight, even though a large part of him thinks that it will all be for nothing (how ironic considering that African-Americans would not be given their true rights and freedom by the government for nearly 100 years).  Denzel is perfect in the role, especially during the whipping scene in which a continued, painful stare is held until a single tear falls from his face.  It's one of the best scenes in the entire film.Morgan Freeman is equally riveting as another runaway slave, John Rawlins, who has been living in the North for a number of years, working as a grave-digger, and wondering when, if ever, he would be given the opportunity to fight.  Rawlins's prime role is not only in helping Shaw relate to the men, but also in looking out for the men as well.At first, Shaw finds himself having to push against the system to get even the most basic needs for his men, such as shoes and socks (considering most of his men are either barefoot, or have shoes that barely function).  When he finds that his men are only being used for slave labor, as well as for helping to illegaly pillage southern towns, he finally uses his powerful government connections to put pressure on the general to allow his men to fight.This film has so many powerful and touching moments, I could fill up pages relaying them all to you.  One of my favorites, is the men singing the night before the assault on Fort Wagner.  They are singing around a campfire and asking the Lord for his blessings.Another, is Shaw on the beach, realizing that he probably won't be coming back from what seems to be an almost suicidal mission.  However, Shaw realizes, that regardless of the outcome of the battle, a great victory is on the verge of being won even though he is fighting through his own fear of an almost certain death. And this is why he says those epic words to the reporter as he hands over his journals, ""If I should fall, remember what you see here.""I must mention that powerful music that accompanies this film by James Horner.

Why are we made to see the African American troops through his eyes instead of seeing him through theirs?Despite that petty rant, and some historical inaccuracies (e.g., the 54th was not the first regiment to hire non-whites), this is a very well-made movie that's definitely worth owning for its absolutely electric atmosphere.

It catalogues perhaps one of the Civil War's youngest Commanders; Colonel Robert Gould Shaw who led the 54th Masschusettes Volunteers which was also the US's first ever all Black Regiment against the South in the 1861-65 conflict that shaped America as we know it today. It's a gorgeous epic film of sweeping proportions with I think, has one of the best stirring soundtracks I've heard in any civil War movie which captures the spirit even if a little 'thatrical' in some areas. ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" actor Matthew Broderick carries off well the young & spirited Robert Shaw with sterling performances from venerable veterans such as Denzel Washington & Morgan Freeman. This is a Civl War must-have film alongside Gettysberg and classics such as ""The Red Badge of Courage"" of America's first black regiment, right up until their heroic downfall during the assault on Charlston's Fort Wagner in which they suffered horrendous losses in any known campaign throughout the Civil War. In fact, ""Fort Wagner"" repelled the 54th's brave if perhaps overwhelmed assault and prevailed, Fort Wagner in fact was never taken... I can watch this movie over and over, as it details the period's elite American socialite families that were given commissions as they were to lead such as Shaw was.

It was just another boring day at school sitting in my history class drawing random drawings in my notebook. Suddenly my teacher says we're going to watch a movie. I wake up from my dreamy state and I decide I'll give it a chance. He loads the VCR tape into the machine and I fix my eyes upon the screen.I will put ""Glory"" into a few words--this is what every war movie strives to be and beyond. Glory tells the story of a Civil War colonel (Matthew Broderick) who leads the war's first all-black volunteer regimen into battles and discovers along the way he has to confront the moral question of racial prejudice within, and outside of, his regimen.So as I'm sitting in history class watching ""Glory,"" I immediately begin to perk up. From the explosive first scene, I was fully awake. My luck skyrocketed when I discovered two of my all-time favorite actors in the film, Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The movie progressed and I found myself becoming yet more and more drawn into the film--not just watching it, but actually EXPERIENCING every ounce of war, prejudice, and moral questions that face the characters in the movie.What's even more, is that you find yourself becoming attached to ALL of the characters--every single black soldier--in some strange way, so strange, that when these men fall in battle you feel a jolt of power inside of you that is converted to emotional sadness in your mind.The final scenes in Glory are mesmerizing. No, more than that--utterly spectacular. The final battle scene at Fort Wagner is so amazingly shot you will think you're actually there fighting along with the black regimen. You're not in your seat watching the film--you feel like you're there! The final battle scene is so spectacular, it will easily remain one of the most memorable battle scenes I've ever witnessed in all of film. After watching Glory, you will find yourself truly moved in all ways possible. You will almost feel like a new person.All of this paired with a beautiful score by James Horner, Glory is simply one of the best war movies of all-time. Anyone who misses this film is missing out one of the most powerful, moving, and memorable experiences a movie can bring you.I'm so glad I found myself in history this year.",5,This is the definition of a truly great war movie.,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,2302,"['be', 'quite', 'honest', 'had', 'low', 'expectations', 'Glory', 'was', 'just', 'boring', 'day', 'school', 'sitting', 'history', 'class', 'drawing', 'random', 'drawings', 'notebook', 'Suddenly', 'teacher', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'wake', 'up', 'dreamy', 'state', 'decide', ""'ll"", 'give', 'chance', 'VCR', 'tape', 'machine', 'fix', 'eyes', 'screen.I', 'will', 'put', 'Glory', 'few', 'words', 'what', 'war', 'movie', 'be', 'Glory', 'story', 'Civil', 'War', 'colonel', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'who', 'war', 'first', 'all-black', 'volunteer', 'regimen', 'battles', 'discovers', 'way', 'confront', 'moral', 'question', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'regimen.So', ""'m"", 'sitting', 'history', 'class', 'watching', 'Glory', 'immediately', 'begin', 'perk', 'up', 'explosive', 'first', 'scene', 'was', 'fully', 'awake', 'luck', 'skyrocketed', 'when', 'discovered', 'two', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'film', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'movie', 'progressed', 'found', 'becoming', 'yet', 'more', 'more', 'drawn', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'watching', 'actually', 'EXPERIENCING', 'ounce', 'war', 'prejudice', 'moral', 'questions', 'face', 'characters', 'movie.What', 'even', 'more', 'find', 'becoming', 'attached', 'characters', 'single', 'black', 'soldier', 'strange', 'way', 'strange', 'when', 'men', 'fall', 'battle', 'feel', 'jolt', 'power', 'converted', 'emotional', 'sadness', 'mind.The', 'final', 'scenes', 'Glory', 'are', 'mesmerizing', 'No', 'more', 'utterly', 'spectacular', 'final', 'battle', 'scene', 'Fort', 'Wagner', 'so', 'amazingly', 'shot', 'will', 'think', ""'re"", 'actually', 'there', 'fighting', 'black', 'regimen', ""'re"", 'not', 'seat', 'watching', 'film', 'feel', ""'re"", 'final', 'battle', 'scene', 'so', 'spectacular', 'will', 'easily', 'remain', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'battle', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'witnessed', 'film', 'watching', 'Glory', 'will', 'find', 'truly', 'moved', 'ways', 'possible', 'will', 'almost', 'feel', 'new', 'person.All', 'paired', 'beautiful', 'score', 'James', 'Horner', 'Glory', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'war', 'movies', 'all-time', 'Anyone', 'who', 'film', 'missing', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'moving', 'memorable', 'experiences', 'movie', 'can', 'bring', 'you.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'found', 'history', 'year']",N/A

However, compared to my SD copy, I don't believe you will see a night and day difference.Audio..3 stars...Dolby True HD...very good audio levels.  Most all audio is across the front stage with discreet channeling, at rare times, between the left and right fronts.  Almost no use was made of the rear channels other than for ambience sounds that really do not come across.  No use of the rears for the discreet directionality when, and especially for battle scenes, there could and should have been considerable use of them.  I was disappointed in the audio though the lossless soundtrack sounded quite nice.  Obviously, with the many battle scenes, your LFE channel is nicely used tho the bottom end does not go quite as deep as you might hear from the cannons in Master and Commander or The Patriot.Glory is a wonderful movie to have in any collection of films.  If you have it in SD I would suggest the blu ray simply for its fine extras and slight improvement in video quality.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",3,Glory on Blu Ray,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",2013,2409,"['question', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'am', 'only', 'reviewing', 'quality', 'transfer', 'SD', 'BluRay', '3', 'stars', 'basis', 'discuss', 'actual', 'quality', 'BR', 'disc', 'let', 'say', 'extras', 'transfer', 'are', 'solid', '5', 'star', 'material', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'history', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'student', 'are', '2', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'well.I', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'never', 'create', 'emotional', 'welling', 'white', 'man', 'can', 'never', 'understand', 'ignorance', 'bigotry', 'brought', 'about', 'slavery', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'might', 'sound', 'naive', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'tho', 'marched', 'civil', 'rights', 'marches', 'Washington', '60', 'even', 'today', 'fail', 'completely', 'understand', 'how', 'one', 'can', 'think', 'race', 'inferior.Video', 'transfer', '4.5', 'stars', '.slight', 'grain', 'depth', 'dimension', 'Good', 'details', 'muted', 'colorization', 'Shadow', 'dark', 'details', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'are', 'complaints', 'saw', 'artifacting', 'aliasing', 'point', 'However', 'compared', 'SD', 'copy', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'will', 'see', 'night', 'day', 'difference.Audio..3', 'stars', 'Dolby', 'True', 'HD', 'very', 'good', 'audio', 'levels', 'Most', 'audio', 'front', 'stage', 'discreet', 'channeling', 'rare', 'times', 'left', 'right', 'fronts', 'Almost', 'use', 'was', 'made', 'rear', 'other', 'ambience', 'sounds', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'use', 'rears', 'discreet', 'directionality', 'when', 'especially', 'battle', 'scenes', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'considerable', 'use', 'was', 'disappointed', 'audio', 'lossless', 'soundtrack', 'sounded', 'quite', 'nice', 'Obviously', 'many', 'battle', 'scenes', 'LFE', 'channel', 'nicely', 'used', 'tho', 'bottom', 'end', 'not', 'go', 'quite', 'as', 'deep', 'might', 'hear', 'cannons', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Patriot.Glory', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'have', 'collection', 'films', 'have', 'SD', 'would', 'suggest', 'blu', 'ray', 'simply', 'fine', 'extras', 'slight', 'improvement', 'video', 'quality.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

Oftentimes the contributions of African-Americans to the Union's war effort have never been given their just due in the various chronicles of the War.  ""Glory"" attempts to correct this oversight by shining the spotlight on a relatively little-known chapter in history.Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) returns home after being injured in battle at Antietam.  He learns that the Union is planning to organize black soldiers into a new regiment.  When he is offered command of this regiment, Shaw accepts and takes along Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes) to help him train the troops.  The new soldiers include Private Trip (Denzel Washington), Private Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy), Corporal Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), and the wise Sgt. Maj. John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman).  There are growing pains and tension as the officers and enlisted men interact with each other, but eventually the Massachusetts 54th coalesces into a viable fighting force.While the battle scenes in ""Glory"" are outstanding, it is the attention to the men inhabiting the film that is most responsible for making it special.  All of the characters are written exceptionally well and the actors that fill the various roles do outstanding work across the board.  Broderick surprises in a role that seems ill-suited for him and Washington and Freeman are exceptional as usual.  ""Glory"" also manages to effectively critique the cultural dynamics of the era without becoming overly-preachy.  Difficult issues and ingrained attitudes are honestly explored and not glossed over in order to play it safe.  This is the rare film that manages to not only entertain but to give you something to mull over when upon its conclusion.",3,"""We were a sight to see!""",1095465600,"09 18, 2004",2004,1781,"['Edward', 'Zwick', 'Glory', 'Civil', 'War', 'tale', 'different', 'perspective', 'contributions', 'African-Americans', 'Union', 'war', 'effort', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'given', 'just', 'due', 'various', 'chronicles', 'War', 'Glory', 'attempts', 'correct', 'oversight', 'shining', 'spotlight', 'relatively', 'little-known', 'chapter', 'history.Colonel', 'Robert', 'Gould', 'Shaw', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'home', 'being', 'injured', 'battle', 'Antietam', 'Union', 'planning', 'organize', 'black', 'soldiers', 'new', 'regiment', 'When', 'offered', 'command', 'regiment', 'Shaw', 'along', 'Major', 'Cabot', 'Forbes', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'help', 'train', 'troops', 'new', 'soldiers', 'include', 'Private', 'Trip', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Private', 'Jupiter', 'Sharts', 'Jihmi', 'Kennedy', 'Corporal', 'Thomas', 'Searles', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'wise', 'Sgt', 'Maj.', 'John', 'Rawlins', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'are', 'growing', 'pains', 'tension', 'officers', 'enlisted', 'men', 'interact', 'other', 'eventually', 'Massachusetts', '54th', 'coalesces', 'viable', 'fighting', 'battle', 'Glory', 'are', 'outstanding', 'attention', 'men', 'inhabiting', 'film', 'most', 'responsible', 'making', 'special', 'characters', 'are', 'written', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'actors', 'fill', 'various', 'roles', 'do', 'outstanding', 'work', 'board', 'Broderick', 'role', 'ill-suited', 'Washington', 'Freeman', 'are', 'exceptional', 'usual', 'Glory', 'also', 'effectively', 'critique', 'cultural', 'dynamics', 'era', 'becoming', 'overly-preachy', 'Difficult', 'issues', 'ingrained', 'attitudes', 'are', 'honestly', 'explored', 'not', 'glossed', 'over', 'order', 'play', 'safe', 'rare', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'entertain', 'give', 'something', 'mull', 'over', 'when', 'conclusion']",N/A

After all, the story of the 54th Massachusetts, the first black regiment in the Union Army and its courageous assault on the formidable defence works of Fort Wagner, is a great one and a major step forward for the blacks of the USA. However, I found the whole thing to be rather bloodless and, well, lacking fire in its belly. I have no idea what the real Col. Shaw was like, but I can't imagine the character as played by Matthew Broderick being terribly inspirational. I thought it was overall a poor acting performance, redeemed slightly at the end as he confronts the likelihood of his death in the assault on Fort Wagner. Morgan Freeman plays a version of his wise old uncle act and even the usually excellent Denzel Washington I found not particularly impressive.The best bit is the assault on Fort Wagner, which is very well done, and accompanied by a splendid score from James Horner (inspired at least in part by Carl Orff's ""Carmina Burana""). Even there it has a disappointing, abrupt ending, leaving the viewer to puzzle what happened next (there is no mention of the retreat, or of the wounded sergeant who brought back the flag and was to be the first black man to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor).I realise that the characters for such a film have to be largely fictitious, or composites of real characters, but I'm sure it could have been better done.

They took horrendous casualties, nearly fifty percent, including the young colonel who commanded them, Col. Robert G. Shaw. Tactically, this battle was of little account to the course of the war, but symbolically it had the power of a mighty Niagara. It proved that black men could and would fight and die for their country and their freedom, and opened the way for thousands more to join the ranks of the Union. The balance on the scales of war was tipped unalterably to the Union.Like that battle whose history it chronicles, `Glory' is a movie whose primary importance lies in its symbolism. While it is a cut above most movies made about the Civil War, it is not of itself a great movie. While adequate, none of the actors involved were up to their best work, not even Denzel Washington who won the best supporting actor Oscar for his role. Matthew Broderick was down-right wooden as Colonel Shaw in one of the weakest performances of his career. And direct Zwick depended far too heavily on the swell of the orchestral score and chorus to note significant moments in his film. Still, after shining through the prism of the symbolic events that it portrayed, this movie somehow managed to become more than the sum of its parts, and if I cannot call it great, I can at least say that it is a good film that is well worth your viewing.The historical details of uniforms and equipment are nearly flawless in `Glory'. It does take some creative liberties with the history, chiefly by portraying the 54th as being made up mainly of escaped slaves from the South rather than being composed of mostly free black men from New England, as was the case. I found this to be an acceptable liberty, as I believe the writers were trying to tell the larger story of the black Union soldier with this opening chapter. Thomas, one of the principal characters in the regiment is portrayed as an educate free black man from Boston, and stands in for the men who historically made up the 54th.`Glory' includes several scenes of battle, and for the most part, they are well done. Though they stop far short of showing the actual horror, gore, and savagery that was the typical battle field of the Civil War, they hint most effectively at it. They are far better than the typical re-enactors pageants that pass for battle scenes in many Civil War movies. Unfortunately Zwick chose to use a swelling orchestral score behind the battles instead of allowing the natural din of the fight to enhance the realism of the scenes, and this detracts slightly from their effectiveness.While `Glory' is not a great movie, it is good enough, with enough stirring moments to make it memorable. It does a fair job of telling a most important story, and should not be missed by anyone with more than a passing interest in the Civil War.Theo Logos",4,"Great Story, Fair Movie",1114819200,"04 30, 2005",2005,2991,"['summer', '1863', '54th', 'Massachusetts', 'Infantry', 'Regiment', 'nation', 'first', 'black', 'regiment', 'led', 'unsuccessful', 'attack', 'Confederate', 'Fort', 'Wagner', 'South', 'Carolina', 'took', 'horrendous', 'casualties', 'nearly', 'fifty', 'percent', 'including', 'young', 'colonel', 'who', 'commanded', 'Col.', 'Robert', 'G.', 'Shaw', 'Tactically', 'battle', 'was', 'little', 'account', 'course', 'war', 'symbolically', 'had', 'power', 'mighty', 'Niagara', 'proved', 'black', 'men', 'could', 'would', 'fight', 'die', 'country', 'freedom', 'opened', 'way', 'thousands', 'more', 'join', 'ranks', 'Union', 'balance', 'scales', 'war', 'was', 'tipped', 'unalterably', 'Union.Like', 'battle', 'history', 'Glory', 'movie', 'primary', 'importance', 'symbolism', 'cut', 'most', 'movies', 'made', 'Civil', 'War', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'adequate', 'none', 'actors', 'involved', 'were', 'up', 'best', 'work', 'not', 'even', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'who', 'won', 'best', 'supporting', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'was', 'down-right', 'wooden', 'Colonel', 'Shaw', 'one', 'weakest', 'performances', 'career', 'direct', 'Zwick', 'depended', 'far', 'too', 'heavily', 'swell', 'orchestral', 'score', 'chorus', 'note', 'significant', 'moments', 'film', 'Still', 'shining', 'prism', 'symbolic', 'events', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'somehow', 'managed', 'become', 'more', 'sum', 'parts', 'can', 'not', 'call', 'great', 'can', 'least', 'say', 'good', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing.The', 'historical', 'details', 'uniforms', 'equipment', 'are', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'Glory', 'take', 'creative', 'liberties', 'history', 'chiefly', 'portraying', '54th', 'being', 'made', 'up', 'mainly', 'escaped', 'slaves', 'South', 'rather', 'being', 'composed', 'mostly', 'free', 'black', 'men', 'New', 'England', 'was', 'case', 'found', 'be', 'acceptable', 'liberty', 'believe', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'tell', 'larger', 'story', 'black', 'Union', 'soldier', 'opening', 'chapter', 'Thomas', 'one', 'principal', 'characters', 'regiment', 'portrayed', 'educate', 'free', 'black', 'man', 'Boston', 'men', 'who', 'historically', 'made', 'up', '54th.', 'Glory', 'several', 'scenes', 'battle', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'stop', 'far', 'short', 'showing', 'actual', 'horror', 'gore', 'savagery', 'was', 'typical', 'battle', 'field', 'Civil', 'War', 'hint', 'most', 'effectively', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'typical', 're-enactors', 'pageants', 'pass', 'battle', 'scenes', 'many', 'Civil', 'War', 'movies', 'Unfortunately', 'Zwick', 'chose', 'use', 'swelling', 'orchestral', 'score', 'battles', 'instead', 'allowing', 'natural', 'din', 'fight', 'enhance', 'realism', 'scenes', 'slightly', 'effectiveness.While', 'Glory', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'good', 'enough', 'enough', 'stirring', 'moments', 'make', 'memorable', 'fair', 'job', 'telling', 'most', 'important', 'story', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'anyone', 'more', 'passing', 'interest', 'Civil', 'War.Theo', 'Logos']",N/A

Shaw at first does not realize what he has gotten himself into, as the soldiers blatantly disrespect the commander, causing more havoc than training for a war.  With the help from fellow officer Morgan Freeman and the intense soldier Denzel Washington (the Oscar-winning role that made him a star), the regiment learns how to overcome the obstacles of racism, learn how to prepare for battle like a family, and ultimately get the chance to fight for what they believe in.  Withstanding adversity and finally getting the chance to engage in combat, the 54th regiment stages an incredible battle against the Confederate forces at Fort Wagner, Carolina-paving the way for not only an unforgettable finale, but showing a portrayal of true bravery and pride as the soldiers' heralded defeat cemented a place in history.Broderick is outstanding in one of his first dramatic roles (branching from stellar comedic roles in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and ""Biloxi Blues""), Freeman delivers his usual grand role as Major John Rawlins, and Denzel Washington is timeless as the rebel soldier Private Trip.  A fantastic musical score accompanies much of the training rituals and battle sequences, adding a touch of harmony to the exceptionally choreographed war illustrations.  Although it did not receive any major Academy Award wins (diagnosed later as the ""Saving Private Ryan"" syndrome), ""Glory"" is one of the most important war films to ever be made.  Eloquent, striking, ruthless, brash, and spectacular.  The DVD features exceptional bonus commentaries from the main assets of the cast, as well as interesting historical information and readings of Shaw's letters.",5,Glory  (1989),1085875200,"05 30, 2004",2004,2438,"['Director', 'Edward', 'ZwickCast', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Andre', 'Braugher.Running', 'Time', '202', 'minutes.Perhaps', 'most', 'beautiful', 'honest', 'mesmerizing', 'combat', 'depiction', 'time', 'Glory', 'quintessential', 'tale', 'set', 'standard', 'Civil', 'War', 'representations', 'Loosely', 'based', 'Robert', 'Gould', 'Shaw', 'letters', 'books', 'Lay', 'Laurel', 'Lincoln', 'Kirstein', 'One', 'Gallant', 'Rush', 'Peter', 'Burchard', 'superb', 'motion', 'picture', 'what', 'great', 'filmmaking-promoting', 'bravery', 'heart', 'standing', 'up', 'beliefs', 'most', 'importantly-freedom.Matthew', 'Broderick', 'stars', 'Shaw', 'young', 'son', 'famed', 'Boston', 'abolitionist', 'volunteer', 'commander', 'chief', 'African-American', '54th', 'regiment', 'Massachusetts', 'Shaw', 'first', 'not', 'realize', 'what', 'gotten', 'soldiers', 'blatantly', 'disrespect', 'commander', 'causing', 'more', 'havoc', 'training', 'war', 'help', 'fellow', 'officer', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'intense', 'soldier', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Oscar-winning', 'role', 'made', 'star', 'regiment', 'how', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'racism', 'learn', 'how', 'prepare', 'battle', 'family', 'ultimately', 'get', 'chance', 'fight', 'what', 'believe', 'Withstanding', 'adversity', 'finally', 'getting', 'chance', 'engage', 'combat', '54th', 'regiment', 'stages', 'incredible', 'battle', 'Confederate', 'forces', 'Fort', 'Wagner', 'Carolina-paving', 'way', 'not', 'only', 'unforgettable', 'finale', 'showing', 'portrayal', 'true', 'bravery', 'pride', 'soldiers', 'heralded', 'defeat', 'cemented', 'place', 'history.Broderick', 'outstanding', 'one', 'first', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'branching', 'stellar', 'comedic', 'roles', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'Day', 'Off', 'Biloxi', 'Blues', 'Freeman', 'usual', 'grand', 'role', 'Major', 'John', 'Rawlins', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'timeless', 'rebel', 'soldier', 'Private', 'Trip', 'A', 'fantastic', 'musical', 'score', 'accompanies', 'much', 'training', 'rituals', 'battle', 'sequences', 'adding', 'touch', 'harmony', 'exceptionally', 'choreographed', 'war', 'illustrations', 'did', 'not', 'receive', 'major', 'Academy', 'Award', 'diagnosed', 'later', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'syndrome', 'Glory', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'war', 'films', 'ever', 'be', 'made', 'Eloquent', 'striking', 'ruthless', 'brash', 'spectacular', 'DVD', 'exceptional', 'bonus', 'commentaries', 'main', 'assets', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'historical', 'information', 'readings', 'Shaw', 'letters']",N/A

Gettysburg is indeed the most famous but yet when it comes to the fighting, I would have to say Glory takes the lead!  Glory is a great movie that captures the nations thoughts and ideas about a black regiment coming to arms to fight for the Union.

The cast is a wonderfully set group featuring Matthew Broderick,Morgan Freeman and Densel Washington. Each offers excellent acting and Morgan Freeman I would have to say was at his best!  The story is bit off of history as the character Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) was bit off from history as he wasn't as nice or thoughtful to black soldiers as the movie may portray.Undoubtedly, this movie has the best fighting scenes I've ever seen in a Civil War movie.  The first large scale battle scene at Antietam was absolutely outstanding and deserves a lot of credit as it captured the hostilities of war.

Freeman's character is the opposite: sharing wisdom gained from years of hardship, leading those around him with strength and a more positive attitude. As the movie progresses, both men demonstrate different strengths that serve them and others well in battle.",5,Powerful,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,702,"['have', 'watched', 'Glory', 'least', 'three', 'times', 'powerful', 'moving', 'story', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'shines', 'difficult', 'role', 'playing', 'colonel', 'who', 'must', 'hide', 'feelings', 'friends', 'make', 'painful', 'decisions', 'put', 'lives', 'entire', 'command', 'risk', 'death', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'performed', 'brilliantly', 'too', 'Washington', 'angry', 'resentful', 'young', 'man', 'bitterness', 'infect', 'Freeman', 'character', 'opposite', 'sharing', 'wisdom', 'gained', 'years', 'hardship', 'leading', 'strength', 'more', 'positive', 'attitude', 'movie', 'men', 'demonstrate', 'different', 'strengths', 'serve', 'others', 'well', 'battle']",N/A

This DVD only made me appreciate more and I'm glad I rented it.Matthew Broderick gives an excellent portrayal of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, who is selected to lead the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first all black regiment of the Civil War. He not only has to fight for respect for his men, but also for his own respect. Cary Elwes is Shaw's brother, who is picked to help lead the 54th. Among the soldiers is Denzel Washington, in an Academy Award Winning Performance and Morgan Freeman. Washington, in the beginning of the movie, has no respect for the White man and hates him. But at the end, he gets rid of his hatred. That's what I think the film's final image represents: the unity of the black and white man as one. Shaw also gains the respect of his men when they charge Fort Wagner.The extras on the DVD are excellent. There is a commentary track from Director Edward Zwick that is excellent, though it may distract you from the movie. There are two featurettes: The original 1989 featurette that briefly covers the film's making and ""Voices of Glory"", which covers the story of the 54th from the actual letters from those who served. There is the original theatrical trailer as well as trailers for two other Denzel Washington movies (A Soldier's Story and Devil in a Blue Dress). There are also talent files and two deleted scenes. Though fascinating, after watching these scenes (With or without Zwick's commentary), it will be easy to see why they were deleted in the first place.The picture and sound quality is excellent. My only gripe is that in some scenes the sound is a bit low. Glory is one of those movies that uses both images and sound to its advantage. Nevertheless, the film is still just as powerful, especially during the final scenes at Fort Wagner.So all things considered, this DVD transfer is excellent and would make a welcome addition to anyone's collection",5,Excellent DVD of an excellent movie,1003363200,"10 18, 2001",2001,1993,"['Recently', 'rented', 'DVD', 'Civil', 'War', 'epic', 'Glory', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'loved', 'DVD', 'only', 'made', 'appreciate', 'more', ""'m"", 'glad', 'rented', 'it.Matthew', 'Broderick', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'Colonel', 'Robert', 'Gould', 'Shaw', 'who', 'selected', 'lead', '54th', 'Massachusetts', 'Regiment', 'first', 'black', 'regiment', 'Civil', 'War', 'not', 'only', 'fight', 'respect', 'men', 'also', 'own', 'respect', 'Cary', 'Elwes', 'Shaw', 'brother', 'who', 'picked', 'help', 'lead', '54th', 'soldiers', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winning', 'Performance', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Washington', 'beginning', 'movie', 'respect', 'White', 'man', 'end', 'rid', 'hatred', 'what', 'think', 'film', 'final', 'image', 'unity', 'black', 'white', 'man', 'one', 'Shaw', 'also', 'gains', 'respect', 'men', 'when', 'charge', 'Fort', 'Wagner.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'track', 'Director', 'Edward', 'Zwick', 'excellent', 'may', 'distract', 'movie', 'are', 'two', 'featurettes', 'original', '1989', 'featurette', 'film', 'making', 'Voices', 'Glory', 'story', '54th', 'actual', 'letters', 'who', 'served', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'as', 'well', 'trailers', 'two', 'other', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'movies', 'Soldier', 'Story', 'Devil', 'Blue', 'Dress', 'are', 'also', 'talent', 'files', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'fascinating', 'watching', 'scenes', 'Zwick', 'commentary', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'were', 'deleted', 'first', 'place.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'only', 'gripe', 'scenes', 'sound', 'bit', 'low', 'Glory', 'one', 'movies', 'images', 'sound', 'advantage', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'still', 'just', 'powerful', 'especially', 'final', 'scenes', 'Fort', 'Wagner.So', 'things', 'considered', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'would', 'make', 'welcome', 'addition', 'anyone', 'collection']",N/A

There is always one bad seed(Actor) in the bunch who just stand out like a sore thumb amoung others and doesnt belong. Any guesses who? Yep Matthew Broderick, i have never liked him as an actor and i never will, Broderick is not even in the same solar system let alone acting league as greats like Washington and Freeman. When the movie started i thought oh great, i didnt even remember that he was in this. Now i know why its been over 20 years since i decided to. The making of the Emancupation Proclamation was a very good story, and showing the colored folk finally get to go to wars after years of slavery and oppression. I would have taken a good 80's actor like Sam Elliot, Kurt Russell or even Kevin Costner for that matter over Broderick any day. He's to much of a kid, and every time i think of him my first thoughts are Ferris Buelers day off and War Games, two movies i also hated. So basically you have a fantastic premise, a fine cast minus Matt, good atmosphere and just the right amount of drama for a great film. Its just bad i can't look past the fact of how bad an actor Broderick is. If you wanna watch it, i'm sure you'll love it. Me, i just can't look past the one bad seed.Other horrid actors to steer clear of in very popular films. Brandon Freiser-How in gods name he ever became popular is beyond, me, Encino Man anyone? And he was in Crash an Oscar winning film, wow.Kneanu Reeves-DUDE!!, Go out there o foul demons, Constantine, The Devils Horrible Advocate(working with a legend like Al Pacino) HOW!!I won't go on a rant since it has little to nothing to do with this film, but you get the point, one bad member of the cast can ruin a great film.
