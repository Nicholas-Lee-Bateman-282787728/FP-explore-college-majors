These movies have nothing to do with original movie (one of my favorites) except in basic thought.  Millionaire giving party for cheating wife with strangers and nothing goes as planned for wife or husband.  This version is scarier, I didn't think I'd like it but watched by accident and got hooked and have now watched several times and am looking forward to adding to my collection.

1259007,A17HQQGIT3PDWJ,B002AS45VK,G.M. Vans,"[0, 0]","I watch both of these films.  And, their vexatious nature kept me upset the entire time.  If you enjoy the horror genre in films, these two movies will ""Fill Your Cup"".  I purchased the films because I remembered the original starring Vincent Price in 1959.  Since I viewed that film as a child, it gave me the creeps as well.  But, modern technological advancement in film making has created a subtle work of art, turgid, with continual images of horrid events.  In my opinion, Actor Jeffrey Combs's character, Dr. Richard Vannacut, and his glowering psycho nurses, epitomized this films content.  To me, they were the examples of nightmarish terror at the highest levels.  These characters were in both films.Therefore, I always view this movie during the daylight hours.  And, I make sure that my lunch or dinner is deep in my digestional track.  Because a few times, I had to cover my mouth so that I wouldn't vomit.  I'm glad its only a movie and not reality.  Lately, I view the film for desensitizing purposes.  I think I need to view it another ten times and then, maybe, I'll be cured of ""House on Haunted Hill"" and its ""Return"".",5,Nightmare Film,1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,1138,"['watch', 'films', 'vexatious', 'nature', 'kept', 'entire', 'time', 'enjoy', 'horror', 'genre', 'films', 'two', 'movies', 'will', 'Fill', 'Cup', 'purchased', 'films', 'remembered', 'original', 'starring', 'Vincent', 'Price', '1959', 'viewed', 'film', 'child', 'gave', 'creeps', 'as', 'well', 'modern', 'technological', 'advancement', 'film', 'making', 'created', 'subtle', 'work', 'art', 'turgid', 'continual', 'images', 'horrid', 'events', 'opinion', 'Actor', 'Jeffrey', 'Combs', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Richard', 'Vannacut', 'glowering', 'psycho', 'nurses', 'epitomized', 'films', 'content', 'were', 'examples', 'nightmarish', 'terror', 'highest', 'levels', 'characters', 'were', 'films.Therefore', 'always', 'view', 'movie', 'daylight', 'hours', 'make', 'sure', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'deep', 'digestional', 'track', 'few', 'times', 'had', 'cover', 'mouth', 'would', ""n't"", 'vomit', ""'m"", 'glad', 'only', 'movie', 'not', 'reality', 'Lately', 'view', 'film', 'desensitizing', 'purposes', 'think', 'need', 'view', 'ten', 'times', 'then', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'cured', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'Return']",House on Haunted Hill / Return to House on Haunted Hill

1259009,A1LGDLGQXO4XO0,B002AS45VK,Jackie Morton,"[0, 0]","I choose this rating because the movies is good. What I like about the movies is that Geoffrey Rush stars in this chilling remake of William Castle's cult classic. Five strangers are each offered a chance to earn one million dollars if they can survive a night in a house that was once an insane asylum run by a deranged and sadistic doctor. But what starts out as a harmless birthday prank soon turns into a night of horrific terror. Sarah Wolfe was the only living survivor from the massacre at the Vanacutt Mansion, but no one believed her claims that ghosts were responsible for the gruesome murders that took place there. Now her recent and questionable suicide leaves her sister, Ariel, no choice but to devote herself to finding out who or what was responsible for her death. Ariel discovers that Sarah sent her the diary of the sadistic Dr. Vanacutt just before she died, offering clues to the diabolical evil that resides within the house. But the diary also makes Ariel a target in a deadly treasure hunt that leads a group of unwitting victims back to the Vanacutt Mansion, reawakening the terror imprisoned within the house on the hill, This time, the house and the evil spirits inside are out to make sure that no one leaves alive.  What I dislike about the movies is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movies to other people.",5,House on Haunted Hill / Return to House on Haunted Hill (Double Feature),1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,1360,"['choose', 'rating', 'movies', 'good', 'What', 'like', 'movies', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'chilling', 'remake', 'William', 'Castle', 'cult', 'classic', 'Five', 'strangers', 'are', 'offered', 'chance', 'earn', 'one', 'million', 'dollars', 'can', 'survive', 'night', 'house', 'was', 'once', 'insane', 'asylum', 'run', 'deranged', 'sadistic', 'doctor', 'what', 'out', 'harmless', 'birthday', 'prank', 'soon', 'night', 'horrific', 'terror', 'Sarah', 'Wolfe', 'was', 'only', 'living', 'survivor', 'massacre', 'Vanacutt', 'Mansion', 'one', 'believed', 'claims', 'ghosts', 'were', 'responsible', 'gruesome', 'murders', 'took', 'place', 'there', 'Now', 'recent', 'questionable', 'suicide', 'sister', 'Ariel', 'choice', 'devote', 'finding', 'out', 'who', 'what', 'was', 'responsible', 'death', 'Ariel', 'Sarah', 'sent', 'diary', 'sadistic', 'Dr.', 'Vanacutt', 'just', 'died', 'offering', 'clues', 'diabolical', 'evil', 'house', 'diary', 'also', 'Ariel', 'target', 'deadly', 'treasure', 'hunt', 'group', 'unwitting', 'victims', 'back', 'Vanacutt', 'Mansion', 'reawakening', 'terror', 'imprisoned', 'house', 'hill', 'time', 'house', 'evil', 'spirits', 'are', 'make', 'sure', 'one', 'alive', 'What', 'dislike', 'movies', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'would', 'recommend', 'movies', 'other', 'people']",House on Haunted Hill / Return to House on Haunted Hill
