In fact, the last two minutes go by so fast you have to look quick to see what's happening. This great story was not handled very well at the end, mostly due to the speed of events. It's like being served a big juicy steak and then forced to swallow it whole.In Mr Schneider's commentary he says ""The purpose of the movie is to raise questions, then answer them at the end"". But they were not answered.Why didn't the director add a few seconds of text to complete the story as other movies do. To me, we were cheated out of a complete ending to a very good story.Did Mary go home on Christmas eve? What were the conservations after the miracles? What did Mary include in the ""At Home For Christmas"" final program? Did Mary get her job promotion and become a part-time mother? Did everyone accept the miracles and become an instant family with Mary becoming a full time mother? These are just a few questions that come mind. I haven't been able to find a book that may furnish some of the answers.It's too late to fix this movie because Jenna Boyd would be too old now, but there could be a second movie that starts out with some explanation.
