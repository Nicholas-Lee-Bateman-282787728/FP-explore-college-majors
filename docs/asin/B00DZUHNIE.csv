1663168,A8IZZHVLE87TV,B00DZUHNIE,L. Miller,"[0, 0]","A group of people are gathered on Dead Man's Island. The owner's life is threatened. A storm is brewing.  This, to me, is an almost unfailing recipe for a good time.  There's nothing I like better than a classic mystery set on an island, train or boat.  Think And Then There Were None, Evil Under the Sun or Death on the Nile by Agatha Christie.  Of course, the quality is not up to that standard, or even the book by Carolyn Hart, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  But who cares?  The cast is a collection of veteran tv and movie actors, which was fun in itself (do you recognize the maid?), and I smiled through the whole thing.  If you enjoy old classic mysteries, and are willing to lower your expectations a bit and just enjoy this for what it is, give it a try.  I wish there were more movies like this to be had, can't get enough.",4,Relax and enjoy,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,832,"['group', 'people', 'are', 'gathered', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Island', 'owner', 'life', 'threatened', 'storm', 'brewing', 'almost', 'unfailing', 'recipe', 'good', 'time', 'nothing', 'like', 'better', 'classic', 'mystery', 'set', 'island', 'train', 'boat', 'Think', 'Then', 'Were', 'None', 'Evil', 'Sun', 'Death', 'Nile', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'course', 'quality', 'not', 'up', 'standard', 'even', 'book', 'Carolyn', 'Hart', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'who', 'cast', 'collection', 'veteran', 'tv', 'movie', 'actors', 'was', 'fun', 'do', 'recognize', 'maid', 'smiled', 'whole', 'thing', 'enjoy', 'old', 'classic', 'mysteries', 'are', 'willing', 'lower', 'expectations', 'bit', 'just', 'enjoy', 'what', 'give', 'try', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'movies', 'be', 'had', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough']",Dead Man's Island

1663170,ASRUYRC3R5J6Q,B00DZUHNIE,sasha,"[2, 3]","This movie is based on the book ""Dead Man's Island"" written by Carolyn Hart and is part of the Henrie O series.  The movie followed the book except for one section.William Shatner plays Chase Prescott, a wealthy businessman whose life is threatened.  He invites everyone who was present during several attempts on his life to his island.  Barbara Eden played the role of Henrie O, an investigative journalist, invited by Chase Prescott to the Island to discover who wants to kill him.  Eden was excellent as Henrie O and seemed made for that particular part.Other guests were Morgan Fairchild, Roddy McDowell and Christopher Cazenove.A storm is brewing.  There is no way off the island (to discover the reason for this you have to read the book or see the movie).  Chase Prescott is murdered or is he?  As the storm intensifies the trees crash into the windows in the house and the guests are forced to seek higher ground until they are rescued.This is a very short version of events as I did not want to spoil it for you.  The book gives a detailed description of a long night in the house surrounded by snakes and people surviving on pieces of lumber.Color and sound were excellent.  There are no subtitles but my husband who has hearing difficulties could hear the movie very well.I enjoyed the movie and so did my husband.  The identity of the murderer if there was a murder is a real surprise and I won't say anymore to spoil it for you.  If you have read the book I think you will enjoy the movie.",5,MURDER ON DEAD MAN'S ISLAND,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,1503,"['movie', 'based', 'book', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Island', 'written', 'Carolyn', 'Hart', 'part', 'Henrie', 'O', 'series', 'movie', 'followed', 'book', 'one', 'section.William', 'Shatner', 'Chase', 'Prescott', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'life', 'threatened', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'present', 'several', 'attempts', 'life', 'island', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'played', 'role', 'Henrie', 'O', 'investigative', 'journalist', 'invited', 'Chase', 'Prescott', 'Island', 'discover', 'who', 'kill', 'Eden', 'was', 'excellent', 'Henrie', 'O', 'seemed', 'made', 'particular', 'part.Other', 'guests', 'were', 'Morgan', 'Fairchild', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'Christopher', 'Cazenove.A', 'storm', 'brewing', 'way', 'island', 'discover', 'reason', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'see', 'movie', 'Chase', 'Prescott', 'murdered', 'storm', 'trees', 'crash', 'windows', 'house', 'guests', 'are', 'forced', 'seek', 'higher', 'ground', 'are', 'rescued.This', 'very', 'short', 'version', 'events', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'spoil', 'book', 'detailed', 'description', 'long', 'night', 'house', 'surrounded', 'snakes', 'people', 'surviving', 'pieces', 'lumber.Color', 'sound', 'were', 'excellent', 'are', 'subtitles', 'husband', 'who', 'hearing', 'difficulties', 'could', 'hear', 'movie', 'very', 'well.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'so', 'did', 'husband', 'identity', 'murderer', 'was', 'murder', 'real', 'surprise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore', 'spoil', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie']",Dead Man's Island

Fortunately, it is also one of her best TV movies.Barbara has the lead role in this movie- everyone else has a supporting part. Barbara stars as a woman who is asked by her old friend (William Shatner) to join him and some guests on his private island. (He has a mansion on the island.) After Barbara gets there, Shatner explains to her that an unknown person is trying to kill him, so he's gathered all of the suspects on the island, and he wants Barbara to figure out who the would-be killer is.Barbara still looks stunningly beautiful in this fun mystery (incredibly she was 65 when she made this!)
