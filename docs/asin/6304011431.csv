The answer comes in many forms. The main answer is that powder is an overlooked work of art and if you stand back and take a breath, can see the many religeous implications that you can get from viewing. I have been hesitant in reviewing powder for the past few months, because I feared that I wouldn't do it justice. I wanted to prepare myself and grow in my writing skills so that you would understand exactly why Powder is so effective.When you think of enduring characters, you may think of Citizen Kane, or William Wallace, maybe even Forest Gump, but due to the unabashadly blatant remarks from Hollywoods critics you are unlikely to think of powder. This is a shame. Though powder is not the all time greatest film, nor will it ever be, it falls into the category of ""timeless"". The special effects were done with next to zero computer effects, so that when C.G. are so realistic you can't tell the difference between real and artificial actors, powder will still be terrific in appearance style wise.At the heart of the story is Jeremy, an albino that is cursed and blessed with multiple abilities. His mind is plagued with clarity and soaks knowledge like a sponge. Jeremy's body is electromagnetic and can manipulate the energy around him. One of the many scenes that catches you with your mouth open, is when his teacher brings in a Jacobs latter (two rods that channel an electric current which climbs up them in a strand). Jeremy grips his desk as a thick electrical bolt rushes him and raises him into the air by his heart.Jeremy is surrounded by people that love and hate him. Or, like the sherrif, just don't understand him. Though his eyes must be shielded from the light of the sun, Jeremy radiates and equally bright amount of love and care on those that need it. To show some what he sees and feels, he makes them feel the pain of the violence that they deliver.Sean Patrick Flannery Gives the performance of his life, and the character he creates, and the humbleness he uses is unforgettable.",5,Lifted by Jacob's Latter,1002067200,"10 3, 2001",2001,2137,"['am', 'supposed', 'tell', 'reader', 'not', 'should', 'see', 'buy', 'powder', 'not', 'time', 'answer', 'many', 'forms', 'main', 'answer', 'powder', 'overlooked', 'work', 'art', 'stand', 'back', 'take', 'breath', 'can', 'see', 'many', 'religeous', 'implications', 'can', 'get', 'viewing', 'have', 'been', 'hesitant', 'reviewing', 'powder', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'feared', 'would', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'wanted', 'prepare', 'grow', 'writing', 'skills', 'would', 'understand', 'exactly', 'why', 'Powder', 'so', 'effective.When', 'think', 'enduring', 'characters', 'may', 'think', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'William', 'Wallace', 'maybe', 'even', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'due', 'unabashadly', 'blatant', 'remarks', 'Hollywoods', 'critics', 'are', 'unlikely', 'think', 'powder', 'shame', 'powder', 'not', 'time', 'greatest', 'film', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'category', 'timeless', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'next', 'zero', 'computer', 'effects', 'when', 'C.G', 'are', 'so', 'realistic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'difference', 'real', 'artificial', 'actors', 'powder', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'terrific', 'appearance', 'style', 'heart', 'story', 'Jeremy', 'albino', 'cursed', 'blessed', 'multiple', 'abilities', 'mind', 'plagued', 'clarity', 'soaks', 'knowledge', 'sponge', 'Jeremy', 'body', 'electromagnetic', 'can', 'manipulate', 'energy', 'One', 'many', 'scenes', 'mouth', 'open', 'when', 'teacher', 'Jacobs', 'latter', 'two', 'rods', 'channel', 'electric', 'current', 'climbs', 'up', 'strand', 'Jeremy', 'desk', 'thick', 'electrical', 'bolt', 'air', 'heart.Jeremy', 'surrounded', 'people', 'love', 'hate', 'sherrif', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'eyes', 'must', 'be', 'shielded', 'light', 'sun', 'Jeremy', 'equally', 'bright', 'amount', 'love', 'care', 'need', 'show', 'what', 'feels', 'feel', 'pain', 'violence', 'deliver.Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'performance', 'life', 'character', 'humbleness', 'unforgettable']",Powder VHS

395658,A2EOE85SDD3ULP,6304011431,Alan Dean Foster,"[1, 1]","Fine, underrated film loosely based on/ripped off from Olaf Stapeldon's SF classic early novel ODD JOHN (available via Amazon, among other sources).  ODD JOHN is about an incredibly intelligent, not-like-us albino child and what happens to him and those around him as he matures.  POWDER is about an incredibly intelligent, not-like-us albino child and what happens to and those around him as he matures.That caveat/complaint aside, POWDER is a fine example of how to make a a science-fiction film that deals with ideas instead of smash-ups on a reasonable budget.  Excellent casting from the stars to the minor roles.  An intelligent human being, Jeff Goldblum gets to play an intelligent role, though I do get a bit tired of his singular stare-of-wonder from time to time (Director: ""Jeff, it's okay to close your mouth once in a while"").  Usual pro score by Jerry Goldsmith, right up there with his little-known work for BALTO.  Film gets 4 stars instead of 5 because of occasional plot contrivances that substitute story convenience for logic.  For example, both Goldblum and Mary Steenburgen's character quickly recognize Powder's exceptionalism, yet neither thinks to apply to take him home with them or otherwise find a proper venue for his maturation.  They can only repeatedly stick him in a home for boys that borders on the Dickensian, thereby jeopardizing his life and wasting his abilities.  In real (as opposed to cinematic) life, as soon as these abilities manifested themselves, Powder would find himself taken in and treated properly by the first university to be made aware of his uniqueness.  Instead, for dramatic purposes the plot is compelled to keep him stuck in a small Texas town.  There are additional breaks in logic that leave the viewer shaking their head...but are necessary for director Salva to hammer his point across to the viewing audience (and judging by some of the thick-headed negative reviews here he could have hammered twice as hard and certain viewers still wouldn't have got it).The acting and direction are a bit heavy-handed, but that's the conundrum faced by anyone wishing to make a science-fiction film about ideas.  Witness the first (negative) reviews of Kubrick's 2001.  The uncredited ""borrowing"" from Stapeldon aside, POWDER is well worth seeing.  Just as ODD JOHN, and all of Stapeldon's pioneering works, are well worth reading.",4,126 reviews and no mention of Olaf Stapeldon's ODD JOHN...sad.,1349136000,"10 2, 2012",2012,2384,"['Fine', 'underrated', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'on/ripped', 'off', 'Olaf', 'Stapeldon', 'SF', 'classic', 'early', 'novel', 'ODD', 'JOHN', 'available', 'Amazon', 'other', 'sources', 'ODD', 'JOHN', 'incredibly', 'intelligent', 'not-like-us', 'albino', 'child', 'what', 'around', 'POWDER', 'incredibly', 'intelligent', 'not-like-us', 'albino', 'child', 'what', 'around', 'caveat/complaint', 'aside', 'POWDER', 'fine', 'example', 'how', 'make', 'science-fiction', 'film', 'deals', 'ideas', 'instead', 'smash-ups', 'reasonable', 'budget', 'Excellent', 'casting', 'stars', 'minor', 'roles', 'intelligent', 'human', 'being', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'play', 'intelligent', 'role', 'do', 'get', 'bit', 'tired', 'singular', 'stare-of-wonder', 'time', 'time', 'Director', 'Jeff', 'okay', 'close', 'mouth', 'once', 'while', 'Usual', 'pro', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'little-known', 'work', 'BALTO', 'Film', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'occasional', 'plot', 'contrivances', 'substitute', 'story', 'convenience', 'logic', 'example', 'Goldblum', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'character', 'quickly', 'recognize', 'Powder', 'exceptionalism', 'yet', 'thinks', 'apply', 'take', 'home', 'otherwise', 'find', 'proper', 'venue', 'maturation', 'can', 'only', 'repeatedly', 'stick', 'home', 'boys', 'borders', 'Dickensian', 'thereby', 'jeopardizing', 'life', 'wasting', 'abilities', 'real', 'opposed', 'cinematic', 'life', 'as', 'soon', 'abilities', 'manifested', 'Powder', 'would', 'find', 'taken', 'treated', 'properly', 'first', 'university', 'be', 'made', 'aware', 'uniqueness', 'Instead', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'plot', 'compelled', 'keep', 'stuck', 'small', 'Texas', 'town', 'are', 'additional', 'breaks', 'logic', 'leave', 'viewer', 'shaking', 'head', 'are', 'necessary', 'director', 'Salva', 'hammer', 'point', 'viewing', 'audience', 'judging', 'thick-headed', 'negative', 'reviews', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'hammered', 'twice', 'as', 'hard', 'certain', 'viewers', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'got', 'acting', 'direction', 'are', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'conundrum', 'faced', 'anyone', 'wishing', 'make', 'science-fiction', 'film', 'ideas', 'first', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'uncredited', 'borrowing', 'Stapeldon', 'aside', 'POWDER', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Just', 'ODD', 'JOHN', 'Stapeldon', 'pioneering', 'works', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'reading']",Powder VHS
395659,A24B06IPXG2BL8,6304011431,"""aldahia905""","[8, 15]","One thing that Powder brings to mind is that humanity has failed.  Humanity has been succumbed to insatible greed, violence, destruction, religious fundamentalism in a bid to have dominance, power and control over others, so insecure male supremacists can play people for fools while laughing all the way to the bank.  Most of the customers who gave this movie a bad review, are more or less likely to be racist, sexist, homophobic, and were angered by the movies' universal themes for they found their faults through Powder's character.  It is irrelevant whether or not ""god"" is simply energy that relays from live form to another.  The message in this movie is that humans before male supremacy were loving, caring, empathetic, sympathetic, open-minded, intellectuals whose values were not the least bid superficial or materialistic.  Their motives for being was working for leisure, living for pleasure, enjoying one another, laughing and loving and reflecting upon themselves and others around them.  People must take the time to connect with others as well as the universe and maybe then the human race will finally stumble OUT of the Dark Ages of which we still reside today.  Jerald Brockert wrote the best review of this movie and emphasized that those who feared this movie (as I have come to notice) are incredibly prejudiced and narrow-minded, and can only feel ""superior"" to others by destroying the lives of otehrs.  Powder represented what humanity was and what it should return to being.  Living for living.  I, personally, don't take any pleasure in destroying the lives of others and if you do, then I don't recommend you watch this film for you are the very evil that you feared most seeing reflected in this film.  Having suffered immense discrimination for my ""liberal-minded"" views, my being mixed-race, and being female as well, I can relate to Powder on every level of this film.All of the scenes were well-planned.  It was a pleasure to finally see de-sexualized women as full human beings and not sex objects to be raped for the picking nor properties of men but contributors to human society.  Jeff Goldblum was outstanding as the science teacher.  Mary Steinburger, although having good intentions, still did not do what she thought best for Powder giving him a supposedly ""adequate"" home.I believe that if you have the humanity and compassion, which most of us all lacking, to cry then you truly are human.  Those of us who are selfish, arrogant, and narrow-minded enough to think we are superior to others because of ""what"" we are as opposed to what one thinks, is a pathetic excuse of existence on Earth.  If we keep whining about violence, racism and prejudice then let's do something about it...eliminate it...if you're down with capitalism or supremacy of any RACE...then let Powder set the example that with compassion, empathy, and an ""attached"" vision with which to look at the world we can overcome all.Brilliant, stunning, captivating, and remarkably touching for those of us with even a little humanity inside.  Powder will remind us all that our technology has surpassed our humanity.  That in the end we are all connected to one another.  If you are MATURE, a FreeThinker, with your own sense of individuality, never longing to be oppressed by any ideology, or fundamentalist behavior (like our beloved Muslim terrorists or capitalist junkies) than liberate yourself, free your soul and try just being HUMAN for once in your life...An eye-opener...Powder plays on your fears like Madonna plays on feminism.I dedicate this movie to intellectuals, women, goths, gays, lesbians, Jews, political activists, children and those who dare to open their minds.",5,All Things Are Possible,1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,3692,"['One', 'thing', 'Powder', 'mind', 'humanity', 'failed', 'Humanity', 'been', 'succumbed', 'insatible', 'greed', 'violence', 'destruction', 'religious', 'fundamentalism', 'bid', 'have', 'dominance', 'power', 'control', 'others', 'insecure', 'male', 'supremacists', 'can', 'play', 'people', 'fools', 'laughing', 'way', 'bank', 'Most', 'customers', 'who', 'gave', 'movie', 'bad', 'review', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'likely', 'be', 'racist', 'sexist', 'homophobic', 'were', 'angered', 'movies', 'universal', 'themes', 'found', 'faults', 'Powder', 'character', 'irrelevant', 'not', 'god', 'simply', 'energy', 'live', 'form', 'message', 'movie', 'humans', 'male', 'supremacy', 'were', 'loving', 'caring', 'empathetic', 'sympathetic', 'open-minded', 'intellectuals', 'values', 'were', 'not', 'least', 'bid', 'superficial', 'materialistic', 'motives', 'being', 'was', 'working', 'leisure', 'living', 'pleasure', 'enjoying', 'one', 'laughing', 'loving', 'reflecting', 'others', 'People', 'must', 'take', 'time', 'connect', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'universe', 'maybe', 'then', 'human', 'race', 'will', 'finally', 'stumble', 'OUT', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'still', 'reside', 'today', 'Jerald', 'Brockert', 'wrote', 'best', 'review', 'movie', 'emphasized', 'who', 'feared', 'movie', 'have', 'come', 'notice', 'are', 'incredibly', 'prejudiced', 'narrow-minded', 'can', 'only', 'feel', 'superior', 'others', 'destroying', 'lives', 'otehrs', 'Powder', 'represented', 'what', 'humanity', 'was', 'what', 'should', 'return', 'being', 'Living', 'living', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'pleasure', 'destroying', 'lives', 'others', 'do', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'watch', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'evil', 'feared', 'most', 'seeing', 'reflected', 'film', 'Having', 'suffered', 'immense', 'discrimination', 'liberal-minded', 'views', 'being', 'mixed-race', 'being', 'female', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'relate', 'Powder', 'level', 'film.All', 'scenes', 'were', 'well-planned', 'was', 'pleasure', 'finally', 'see', 'de-sexualized', 'women', 'full', 'human', 'beings', 'not', 'sex', 'objects', 'be', 'raped', 'picking', 'properties', 'men', 'contributors', 'human', 'society', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'was', 'outstanding', 'science', 'teacher', 'Mary', 'Steinburger', 'having', 'good', 'intentions', 'still', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'what', 'thought', 'best', 'Powder', 'giving', 'supposedly', 'adequate', 'home.I', 'believe', 'have', 'humanity', 'compassion', 'most', 'lacking', 'cry', 'then', 'truly', 'are', 'human', 'who', 'are', 'selfish', 'arrogant', 'narrow-minded', 'enough', 'think', 'are', 'superior', 'others', 'what', 'are', 'opposed', 'what', 'one', 'thinks', 'pathetic', 'excuse', 'existence', 'Earth', 'keep', 'whining', 'violence', 'racism', 'prejudice', 'then', 'let', 'do', 'something', 'eliminate', ""'re"", 'down', 'capitalism', 'supremacy', 'RACE', 'then', 'let', 'Powder', 'set', 'example', 'compassion', 'empathy', 'attached', 'vision', 'look', 'world', 'can', 'overcome', 'all.Brilliant', 'stunning', 'captivating', 'remarkably', 'touching', 'even', 'little', 'humanity', 'inside', 'Powder', 'will', 'remind', 'technology', 'surpassed', 'humanity', 'end', 'are', 'connected', 'one', 'are', 'MATURE', 'FreeThinker', 'own', 'sense', 'individuality', 'never', 'longing', 'be', 'oppressed', 'ideology', 'fundamentalist', 'behavior', 'beloved', 'Muslim', 'terrorists', 'capitalist', 'junkies', 'liberate', 'free', 'soul', 'try', 'just', 'being', 'HUMAN', 'once', 'life', 'eye-opener', 'Powder', 'fears', 'Madonna', 'feminism.I', 'dedicate', 'movie', 'intellectuals', 'women', 'goths', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'Jews', 'political', 'activists', 'children', 'who', 'dare', 'open', 'minds']",Powder VHS

395674,ASKUZHOKQ1W3E,6304011431,"Dane R. Youssef ""surfur""","[2, 8]","by Dane YoussefVictor Salva's ""Powder"" is the kind of movie that when you first read the screenplay, you think... God, this is so full of potential.Think of the endless possibilities. It just needs a rewrite, maybe even a script doctor and we can make this the talked-about film of the year.But the movie gets rushed into filming and it's left with an unfinished feeling.It feels like the studio or the director wanted to make a movie about persecuted outsiders and then thought, ""Well, we want this movie to drive people here in hoards. We need a mainstream film... so lets not make it too smart for people to follow and too deep for people to want to get into. We don't wanna go over people's heads.""It takes a truly original character and plugs him into a movie as routine and unremarkable as the bullying, red-neck catalysts who flaunt 85% of the film's supporting roles. Who just gawk and insult 'cause they're so damn screwed-up themselves, on a personal level.Who's fault is this? The director... or the executives?""Powder"" has some moments that are almost Spielberg-Ian and insights that cause you to think. But there are too many others that almost feel phoned in.Sean Patrick Flanery plays Jeremy Reed, nicknamed ""Powder"" is an amazing superhuman who is almost pure energy and conducts electricity better than water or metal. He has the ability to read minds, magnetize and he can also shatter glass telepathically. He is also a genius.The movie begins with an establishing scene where an expectant mother is driven screaming in an ambulance to the nearest hospital. And not only has her water broke, she has just been struck by lightning.The father demands to see him. The baby is screaming inside the oxygen tent as if it's a burn victim. It almost seems to know what's going on right now. The cries are deafening and heartbreaking.And the father abandons him. The boy lives with his grandparents until they die and poor Powder is once again without family.People who find Powder downstairs in the basement, hiding. From them. From outsiders. From the world.They bundle him up, take him away to a reform school. Why?Um...shouldn't he be sent to an orphanage or something? Why throw him in with criminals who can't be tried as adults?Oh, the formula. Sorry, I forgot.Jeremy is bullied all throughout the movie and takes way too long to retaliate. As if the director is getting too damn into this or has time to kill. Even when it's clear there's no other choice. ""Not much fight in you, huh?"" asks one of them at one point. Obviously not.I can't tell if we takes so long to just use his abilities because he's afraid, he's too good... or the film's gotta too much time to kill and the director's enjoying lashing back.We see Jeremy's pale as death skin and his defined male form. Salva incorporates this scene because of his preference for the male physique. He shows male nudity in a lot of his movies and homosexual elements. There is a moment that suggests that Jeremy might be gay or some of the other kids in the film might have those elements as well.These scenes are well-drawn, no doubt related to Salva's experiences dealing with his own sexuality. Salva himself is gay, yes.Which explains a lot of the endless elaborate homo put-downs throughout the movie and male nudity as well. Even the southern redneck kids don't mind too much getting a gander at Powder's privates.Of course we need (yes, NEED) scenes where Jeremy is persecuted for the way he is. But there are too many of those. They take up way too much of the movie. A scene in a cafeteria, in the woods and in the gymnasium that moves outside onto the field.There are many, many scenes where Jeremy shows his endless powers. Yet too many people are slow to catch on, even the smart ones.There's a truly great scene where a redneck hick deputy sheriff (Brandon Smith) shoots a deer and Powder uses an empathy power so the deputy can feel the deer's pain and suffering.And another where Jeremy is getting involved with the only sweet girl in town and they have a moment where they share kind of Vulcan mind-meld.He has every superpower known to man. He's smart, sweet, kind and all-powerful.But for some reason, he lacks the ability to do the simplest thing and the most obvious thing when the opportunity is right there. So does pretty much everyone else in this film most of the time.I asked myself, why?Oh, the formula. Sorry, I forgot.Jeff Goldblum believes in Jeremy and thinks he could be an advanced step in human evolution. He delivers eloquence about where he explains what Powder is and again later with everything wrong with humanity and how we haven't moved very far in the great human race. And Jeremy could be humanity's answer.The ending is inevitable, but sad. I guess there was just no other way for Powder or the movie. But you walk away wishing Powder AND the movie itself just did more than have big moments involving special effects, dealing with antagonists and only occasionally having a real moment.Still, it's a nice renter. Goldblum's lines about humanity will make you think and Patrick Flanery's performance as the title character are all worthwhile.And there are several scenes that really do stay stuck with you....danessf@yahoo.com[...][...]",2,A unique person.

His science teacher (played by Jeff Goldblum) and the schoolmaster (played by Mary Steenburgen) discover that Powder can control electricity--and has profound wisdom and empathetic insight.Powder is peaceful, tragic Christ-figure who is persecuted for being different and, perhaps, for being prophetic and ""otherworldly"" as well.The ending is powerful and satisfying, especially given the gut-wrenching treatment that Powder endures. Some fascinating mystical themes in this movie include the transformation from the physical into pure spirit, the evolution of man, the capacity of Spirit, the power of love, and the archetypal metaphor of feeling ""not of this world.""",5,Not of This World,1133827200,"12 6, 2005",2005,1057,"['Many', 'individuals', 'feel', 'outcasts', 'world', ""'re"", 'somehow', 'different', 'rest', 'humanity.The', 'central', 'character', 'movie', 'defintely', 'outcast', 'Called', 'Powder', 'snow-white', 'skin', 'teenager', 'was', 'kept', 'grandparent', 'basement', 'entire', 'life', 'brought', 'school', 'system', 'where', 'kids', 'ridicule', 'abuse', 'misunderstand', 'even', 'fear', 'science', 'teacher', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'schoolmaster', 'played', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'discover', 'Powder', 'can', 'control', 'electricity', 'profound', 'wisdom', 'empathetic', 'insight.Powder', 'peaceful', 'tragic', 'Christ-figure', 'who', 'persecuted', 'being', 'different', 'perhaps', 'being', 'prophetic', 'otherworldly', 'well.The', 'ending', 'powerful', 'satisfying', 'especially', 'given', 'gut-wrenching', 'treatment', 'Powder', 'endures', 'fascinating', 'mystical', 'themes', 'movie', 'include', 'transformation', 'physical', 'pure', 'spirit', 'evolution', 'man', 'capacity', 'Spirit', 'power', 'love', 'archetypal', 'metaphor', 'feeling', 'not', 'world']",Powder VHS

It takes place in a small town in Texas where Powder was locked in his grandparents basement for most of his life. They die when hes a teen (he's 16 i think?) and he is picked up by the local sheriff and brought to a school for him to learn. The shock is that he is pure white and bald so immediately he stands out and since hes not really had any interactions with people except in the books he read, he is a total outcast. He befriends a girl that doesn't think hes too different until he gets just a little too close to electricity. What happens next is phenominal.

395699,AFOK05KDCHSHL,6304011431,Libretio,"[79, 80]","POWDER(USA - 1995)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby DigitalEvery so often, a movie comes out of nowhere which touches you so deeply, on so many levels, that it stays in your heart forever. POWDER is such a movie.The premise is deceptively simple: Following the death of his last remaining adult guardian on their isolated farm, a young albino man nicknamed 'Powder' (Sean Patrick Flanery) is taken into the custody of local authorities. But his genius IQ and ability to harness electricity - leading to spectacular displays of apparently 'magical' behavior - arouses the suspicions of frightened townsfolk, and while he's able to change some people's lives for the better (and how!), others are too consumed by hatred to accept this strange, unique outsider. Thus, the stage is set for potential tragedy...Writer-director Victor Salva (also responsible for the superb RITES OF PASSAGE, 1998) has constructed a modern parable which works both as a simple entertainment and as a powerful meditation on the nature of Good and Evil. Episodic in structure, the narrative pitches Powder's strange appearance and gentle manner against some of the worst aspects of the human condition - bigotry, mistrust, cruelty - and though Salva makes a brave attempt to portray these shameful characteristics in various shades of grey, his script acknowledges that some people are defined by their hatred and cannot easily be changed. That said, whilst the film doesn't flinch from the rough stuff, it's ultimately a joyous celebration of the human spirit: Though evil flourishes, goodness prevails.POWDER contains a wealth of memorable moments, but some scenes are truly outstanding, such as Powder's first appearance as a ghost-like figure hovering in the darkness of the cellar where he's been hiding since his grandfather's death; the beautiful/terrible moment in the dining hall of the reformatory when Powder realizes he's never going to be accepted by his peers, no matter how hard he tries; the emotionally devastating sequence with the wounded deer (absolutely unforgettable!); and the sheriff's (Lance Henriksen) last desperate attempt to communicate with his terminally-ill wife (a touching, wordless performance by Dannete McMann). Few other 'fantasy' films of recent years have been so deeply, profoundly moving as this.Production values are top-notch all the way down the line: From Jerzy Zielinski's beautiful, flawless cinematography, to Jerry Goldsmith's low-key score; from Waldemar Kalinowski's unobtrusive production design, to Dennis M. Hill's expert editing - this is the work of talented craftspeople operating at the top of their game, perfectly in tune with the director's intentions. But the real magic is conjured by a superb cast: Top-billed Mary Steenburgen and Jeff Goldblum are quietly effective in virtual supporting roles, while Brandon Smith underplays the part of a bigoted deputy sheriff whose life is changed forever by his encounter with the title character. As always, Lance Henriksen (who also played the lead in Salva's earlier THE NATURE OF THE BEAST, 1994) distinguishes himself as a humane but disillusioned lawman whose convictions are thoroughly shaken by Powder's remarkable abilities. Look out, also, for terrific turns by Bradford Tatum (as the leader of the bullies who make life a misery for Powder), Missy Crider (the potential love-interest) and the always-wonderful Susan Tyrrell (the sheriff's well-meaning but narrow-minded housekepeper) in small but crucial roles.But the heart and soul of the picture is, of course, Powder himself, played with heartbreaking sensitivity by Sean Patrick Flanery. Almost unrecognizable beneath an unusual makeup job (by industry veterans Thomas R. Burman and Bari Dreiband-Burman) which preserves much of his natural beauty whilst also emphasizing the characters' appealing otherworldliness, he plays Powder without any trace of self-pity; instead, he highlights the kindness and vulnerability of a Christ-like figure whose greatest curse is his total comprehension of the world and its inequities, and by his understanding that he'll never be a part of it (when a vicious thug whispers in his ear: ""You really think you can be like us...?"", you half-expect Powder to reply: ""Who'd WANT to be?!""). Powder embodies many of the qualities which are largely absent from our own lives - goodness, compassion, and an appreciation of Nature in all its rich diversity - and Flanery captures those qualities with vivid grace. Of all the fine performances in this exceptional film, his is the most dignified and triumphant.Though aimed at the widest possible audience, POWDER's theme of the persecuted loner will strike a real emotional chord with anyone who's ever found themselves on the sidelines, watching the rest of the world go by. This is a movie which speaks loudest to the outsiders amongst us, the disenfranchised and the dispossessed. It will be warmly embraced by anyone who's ever reached out to others and been rejected... anyone who's ever felt lost and afraid, or found themselves alone in the dark... anyone who's ever believed that the world has turned its back on them because of WHO and WHAT they are... anyone who's ever stood aside from the crowd and refused to relinquish their ideals in the face of overwhelming odds... POWDER is THEIR movie, their glimmer of hope.

Although there are some fantastic and sci-fi elements to it, the real story is about how the people of a small town are affected by a young man with special abilities whose albinism causes him to be the target of suspicion, hatred, and abuse. It's basically the story of the pink monkey that was put in a cage with ""normal monkeys"" and got torn apart because he was different.

395704,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,6304011431,"Maine Writer ""David""","[12, 22]","I liked Powder.  It's not a great movie--there are a few too many problems for that accolade.  But it is creative in a number of respects, and certainly worth seeing.  I must admit, however, that having recently seen that creepy interview with Michael Jackson, he might have seen this movie too, and his skin bleachings may well be proof.First, the flaws.  There's a gnawing and out-of-left-field piece of this film that is suggestive that one of the filmmaker's points was to glorify the ""odd, smart, and sensitive, yet persecuted homosexual"" stereotype.  Perhaps the clearest indication of this is the scene in which Powder stares at a muscular jock in a boy's locker room.  It was a scene that felt entirely out of place in the movie--an add-on that seemed to be intended as an ""in your face"" revelation that Powder represents gays.  The camera also seem to linger a bit too long on the male characters, with the female characters left oddly de-sexualized.  What was irritating about this apparent subtext was that it took away and trivialized what seemed to be a broader message, the message that human beings might well kill someone meant to save them.  In this regard, the more powerful metaphor for Powder seemed to be a Jesus story--with an odd, highly empathic, and powerful ""savior"" born under strange circumstances and ultimately persecuted by those he tried to help.  For me, it work on that level.A number of critics pointed out that the story was derivative.  I agree.  But I thought it took various pieces from other stories and movies and wove them together in a compelling new way.  For me, Powder also worked as a kind of comic book tale of how a superhero might come to pass, and what a person with such powers might be like in real life.  (It was more successful in humanizing a superhero than Unbreakable, in my opinion.)The casting could have been better, though.  Jeff Goldblum was awful.  Apart from his role in the Fly, where I thought he was perfect, he hasn't been able to pull together a decent performance.  I hope Igby Goes Down, which I have yet to see, is redemptive for him.  I've never liked Mary Steenbergen, and found nothing admirable in her performance.  I thought the young actor who played Powder was solid in the role.This is a pleasant entertainment with quite a bit to offer the viewer.  It isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I think it merits three stars.",3,"Come on, people!

After you watch the movie, you will ruminate over it for days. It is that powerful.Powder is our hero, a teenager who is misunderstood and unloved, even by his own family. When he emerges into our world from his grandparents' basement, he cannot even comprehend how cruel people can be every day.Some films have various layers you have to get underneath before they go to your heart, like Forrest Gump. Powder is a film that will go straight to your heart, and will not leave.The setting in which the movie takes place is rural middle America, but seems like another world. The entire movie is akin to a dream. It will probably wont make you cry when you see it, but rather when you have time to fully digest what you have just watched.The best part about this movie is it provides deep emotion without being visually disturbing or graphic. It keeps a very respectable PG-13 rating. You can even feel sorry for the antagonists in the film, and soon you start to empathize with Powder. You could call it a teen Forrest Gump, although Powder's character is less real, but more beautiful than Forrest.I highly recommend this movie. I have talked to ruffian-type teenagers who saw this movie and they despised it. This is because they saw themselves in the antagonists so vividly, that it deeply disturbed them. I liked that.

There were some moving scenes, but i did not like it when everyone used powder and stabbed him in the back after they got what they wanted. I remember my mom saying ""were they his friend or what towards the end they all practicaly turned on him"" I agreed. And the ignorant prejudice against powder for being an albino was exaggerated. I remember saying HE'S JUST REALLY WHITE, so what, but from the very beginning, even before they knew of his powers, they said WHAT THE F*CK WAS THAT? As if he was some sort of inanimate object. It's weird. jUST Stupid demented ideas throughout the story. For instance the spoon scene. The purpose of that failed to be obvious. What is suppose to be cool? Did he do it to show off his abilities but if he was smart and knew people were already very discriminating against him, why let the whole school know that he had powers? WEIRD movie. Nothing made sense. The only scene that did make sense was the deer scene. I'm against sport hunting and i liked it when he put the deers pain and suffering death into the shooter so he could feel what the deer was feeling. That was the one message i had no problem with. THAT and the ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" but that message fails miserably because no one seems to learn that message. The characters keep getting stupider and stupider. And the terminally ill scene was also moving, but like i said they used him, and then turned on him. I havent seen this movie in years but i remember it quite well. It's full of flaws and weird scenes, and comes off as being cheesy at times, and it gets you mad at times TOO.

Why, he would automatically be labeled as a freak, defective, retardate, and deviant, of course!That's the message of this message film, namely, that all you have to do to be denigrated and dehumanized in most of American society is to be ""different."" Whether that difference makes you fundamentally superior or inferior to the norm is irrelevant- all that matters is the fact that one is different. If you don't ""smell right"" to the dominant ape-like personalities in charge, then you must be rejected and driven out. I wish that I could say that the hateful characters in this film came across as cartoonish, but the fact is that they do not- they are perfect examples of the American norm. Even the more intelligent and sympathetic characters, such as Mary Steenburgen's character, participate in the dehumanization by mindlessly following the rules like good ""professionals.""  So, what you have here are the two extremes of human evolution, the god-like man, and the ape-like majority.While it is the writing and message that stands out in this film, the special effects and the quality of dramatic acting are also far above the average.

It shows what man may yet become, by contrasting the ideal with the all-too-prevalent current state of the species. As Jeff Goldblum states at the end, ""I see you and I think that one day our humanity may one day surpass our technology.""I've found that there are few neutral opinions on this movie- people tend to either love it or hate it.

I love everything about this film, from the direction, acting, photography and score... which provides the perfect mood for every scene. The acting especially is incredible... with Sean P Flannery delivering hands down, his best work to date...  a dream role for any actor really.... but its good that he didnt overplay it.... gave it just the right amount of intensity and especially, subtlety to make it authentic and not pretentious. Jeff Goldblum is pretty much perfect in anything he does to me..  and even more when he's playing middle aged intellectuals... pretty much his forte.. lol  Lance Herickssen is amazing in it as well... and there is a scene involving Powder, him and his wife that will remind you what an underated and underused actor the guy is...  guy is another one of those... wipes the floor w most of the hollywood elite kinda actors that truly doesnt get the work that he deserves... what a shame. The message in this film is incredible and really makes you understand how flawed and ignorant society is... especially around things which we dont understand. Some people treat others very bad and the majority of the time, its based on fear or just plain ignorance, which is the case in this film....  but there is always room for growth and this movie reminds u of that....  often more than not, we get caught up in our own little existence and dont really give others the respect and attention that they deserve, not knowing that those others could lead to become very important people in our lives if we give them more entry into our existence... there's a lot to learn from the most unexpected sources.

Well, he is only a man with undesirable urges that got out of control.  At least he had improved or learned to control himself admirably.  He had to direct Sean Patrick Flanery being molested in nude by the tough boys in the movie.  Flanery is a very goodlooking or, may I say, a young man of great beauty.  May be the director is not gay, in the editor's review he didn't say whether the child Salva molested was a boy or girl.  Or may be Mr. Salva doesn't like grownup boy.However, we really shouldn't take issue with Mr. Salva's sexual  inadequacy and concentrate instead on the message that he tried to convey to the viewing public--HUMANITY OVER TECHNOLOGY.  This is an age-old issue of human morality deficiency that man has not been able to correct or improve.  Not only that human cruelty has not been subsided it seems to increase in abominable degree. Just look at the world around you, have you seen any improvement at all.  I don't mean materially of course.Now let come back to the movie, I give it a five-star rating because it's not only quite meaningful, it also very entertaining.  All the actors are good and adequate for their roles, especially, the bad boy who takes great pleasure in harassing Powder.  I don't think Powder is looking at the young man who takes off his shirt and splashes water over himself in front of the mirror in the bathroom with homosexual overtone.  He is only curious and fascinated by a normal barechested male body, all right with admiration if you have to make it that way.  Mr. Salva is undeniably a very intelligent man to be able to write and direct a movie like this.  He is very good in depicting the narrow-mindedness of men.  To involve the divine power and intention to test the human potentiality of human advancement to a higher plane spiritually is more viable or interesting than scientifically.

Lance Henriksen has rarely gotten roles this good. He is allowed a range of emotion that is way beyond most of the stuff he's been doing in the last couple of years.

395740,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6304011431,trebe,"[3, 3]","Directed by Victor Salva (Jeepers Creepers series), Powder (1995) is an odd tale about a young man with paranormal abilities, who has problems adjusting to society.  The story bumps along slowly unfolding like a mystery, developing on several fronts.  The film seems to have aspirations of saying something quite profound, but it perhaps falls short of meeting them.Jimmy Reed (Sean Patrick Flannery) was raised by his grandparents, who because of his unique physical characteristics educated him at home, and never let him leave their house.  The teenager, nicknamed `Powder', is left alone in the world, when his grandfather passes away, and is found in the basement of his home by Sheriff Doug Barnum (Lance Hendriksen), and Jessie Caldwell (Mary Steenburgen) a psychologist.  The young man is an albino, extremely intelligent, but not used to dealing with people.  His body has a strange electrical charge that draws electricity to him.The story follows Reed's adventures as a ward of the state in a boy's home, and in high school.  Wherever is he is, he doesn't exactly fit in, and strange things keep happening.  An experiment in Donald Ripley's (Jeff Goldblum) physics class, demonstrates how electricity has an affinity for Jimmy, as an arc shoots through his body.  Powder displays many strange abilities, acting as a telepath between Barnum and his dying wife, and displaying an ability to tap into people's thoughts.  Powder is found to be a super-genius, and though Caldwell and Ripley try to help him, no one really understands him or can comprehend that he just wants to go home.  With no place left to go, Powder finds freedom in his own unique way.This is more a drama with some supernatural elements, rather than a science fiction horror film.  Sean Patrick Flannery performance is very strong, and Lance Hendriksen shows his sensitive side.  This may make an interesting watch for some, as the viewer is mostly left to fill in many of the blanks.",3,completes the circuit...,1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,1964,"['Directed', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'series', 'Powder', '1995', 'odd', 'tale', 'young', 'man', 'paranormal', 'abilities', 'who', 'problems', 'adjusting', 'society', 'story', 'bumps', 'slowly', 'unfolding', 'mystery', 'developing', 'several', 'fronts', 'film', 'have', 'aspirations', 'saying', 'something', 'quite', 'profound', 'perhaps', 'short', 'meeting', 'them.Jimmy', 'Reed', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'was', 'raised', 'grandparents', 'who', 'unique', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'educated', 'home', 'never', 'let', 'leave', 'house', 'teenager', 'nicknamed', 'Powder', 'left', 'alone', 'world', 'when', 'grandfather', 'away', 'found', 'basement', 'home', 'Sheriff', 'Doug', 'Barnum', 'Lance', 'Hendriksen', 'Jessie', 'Caldwell', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'psychologist', 'young', 'man', 'albino', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'not', 'used', 'dealing', 'people', 'body', 'strange', 'electrical', 'charge', 'electricity', 'him.The', 'story', 'Reed', 'adventures', 'ward', 'state', 'boy', 'home', 'high', 'school', 'Wherever', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fit', 'strange', 'things', 'keep', 'happening', 'experiment', 'Donald', 'Ripley', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'physics', 'class', 'how', 'electricity', 'affinity', 'Jimmy', 'arc', 'shoots', 'body', 'Powder', 'many', 'strange', 'abilities', 'acting', 'telepath', 'Barnum', 'dying', 'wife', 'displaying', 'ability', 'tap', 'people', 'thoughts', 'Powder', 'found', 'be', 'super-genius', 'Caldwell', 'Ripley', 'try', 'help', 'one', 'really', 'can', 'comprehend', 'just', 'go', 'home', 'place', 'left', 'go', 'Powder', 'freedom', 'own', 'unique', 'way.This', 'more', 'drama', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'rather', 'science', 'fiction', 'horror', 'film', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'performance', 'very', 'strong', 'Lance', 'Hendriksen', 'sensitive', 'side', 'may', 'make', 'interesting', 'watch', 'viewer', 'mostly', 'left', 'fill', 'many', 'blanks']",Powder VHS

395742,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,6304011431,Tristan,"[0, 0]","The unusually controversial 90s cult classic Powder is one of those films that works best when the audience watches it knowing little about it. Powder is a beautiful and touching picture with serious artistic value and imagery, but it also gives you plenty to think about as its credits roll. I'll get into all of that later on in this review, and I promised myself that I wouldn't get too into the messiness of the behind-the-scenes antics that have gone on. It is a magnificent film in a lot of ways, and I truly love it. However, I highly recommend that nobody read the IMDB message boards for the film and it's director. If I had the ability, I would tell the world that director Victor Salva is a completely different person than who he used to be, and for people to just move on. His behind-the-scenes drunken behavior on the set of his theatrical debut Clownhouse was unacceptable, and I'm not denying that. It was completely disgusting what he did and I doubt I'll ever have the respect for him as a person as I do as an artist, but I'm not going to go into detail about it here and publicize it any more than it already has been. It's not the kind of thing I like to talk about when I talk about films that I love. That's the only problem this film technically has, however, despite the fact that nothing like that took place behind the scenes of this film. The film has been forever tainted because of the man who made it. People hate the director. People cannot seem to separate the fiction of this film from the reality of the director, and so they'll find questionable material here to gawk over and re-examine despite the fact that none of those ideas existed in the film in the first place.Two novels that I love are The Education of Little Tree by Asa Earl ""Forrest"" Carter and Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. Those books were written by people who I cannot, in good conscience, call anything other than scumbags. However, they were both able to write beautiful novels all the same. At least director Victor Salva was convicted of his crimes and did the time that was required of him. Sure, there will be people out there who say that nothing can ever change the fact that he did what he did, and I totally agree. Nothing can, so lets move on because all you're doing is making the people who suffered out to be nothing more than victims. People are too quick to see them as nothing more than victims. I don't think that a lot of folks realize just how tough it can be to be called a victim for your entire life, and if people would just smarten up and realize that these sorts of bad things happen all the time, they would realize that the true measure of a man is how fast they can pick themselves back up. People who label Victor Salva as nothing more than a monster are simply slowing down the process, and I feel the same way about those who label people like Roman Polanski and Woody Allen as similar things. Folks, just please move on. There's nothing more that you can call him that he hasn't been called, and guess what. He's still making films. Not only that, but he's making good films. In my opinion, his best film is Powder.Anyway, Powder tells the story of an electromagnetic albino boy named Jeremy Reed who is nicknamed ""Powder"" (Sean Patrick Flanery) due to his pale complexion. Powder spent his childhood in the basement of his grandparents reading and re-reading every single book he could manage to get his hands on. By the time he was discovered by the public, he had learned so much but had yet to try and survive in the outside world. Things don't go so well for him as he ends up becoming an outcast to society at large. He is misunderstood almost constantly by his peers. His one brave attempt to make them laugh or even smile falls flat. He is bullied at his reform school almost relentlessly and is shunned by the people around him accept for the sheriff (Lance Henriksen), a psychologist (Mary Steenburgen), and his physics professor (Jeff Goldblum). Eventually it is established that Powder has unique, almost messiah-like abilities and a level of intelligence far beyond any human being in existence. It may be possible that Powder is simply a lost soul whose innocence and purity has been corrupted by this angry and complicated world full of people who are simply afraid of themselves and afraid to take any chances. People like to adapt to habits and hobbies in order to try and define themselves and shield themselves from the public out of fear for the people around them to find out who they really are. This film is simply about a man who is unable to hide who he is from the public and cannot adapt to rituals and hobbies like everyone else can, and therefore he becomes victimized by a harsh and unforgiving world that refuses to even make an attempt to try and understand him. Powder is a man who is born an irreversible non-conformist.Powder is basically a fable, not unlike films such as Edward Scissorhands or Danny Deckchair. To me, however, it is a film that was ahead of its time and will not be able to be fully appreciated by anyone other than those who take the entire film on its own merits. Even for those people, however, there will be some challenges. The film is a lot like Powder, the character. I'm going to be honest. This film's magic did not work on me the first time I viewed it. I thought it was an enjoyable film, but I was also young and it didn't fully resonate with me. Sure, many of the images certainly stuck with me and I found the film to be quite emotional, but I couldn't really see past what made the whole thing so damn exceptional other than the fact that there was a lot of passion and emotion involved in the picture itself. The scene with the deer made me cry when I was little, but I didn't really understand why. This is the kind of film that obeys a lot of pretty typical genre conventions, but then has moments of terrifying realism, not unlike the film Monster's Ball, that made the whole picture very bizarre, surprising, and disturbing. It's sort of like Werner Herzog's Invincible, only without the unbelievable heartache and tragedy. Powder is a much more misunderstood and unhappy character, but never once does he just let his own situations get the better of him. He feels weak and damaged, but that's only because he is. Powder is meant to be portrayed lightly as a kind of messiah, but this isn't so that small-minded viewers can pretend that Victor Salva was trying to paint a portrait of Jesus Christ and all of his glory. Salva directed the film this way because he wanted to craft a metaphor for Powder being a misunderstood man like Jesus Christ was, because lets face it. Who was more misunderstood than Jesus Christ? Abraham Lincoln? Michael Jackson? I think not. To me, if you're going to make a film about a selfless human being, you need to go all the way in showing how helpless man can become as it progresses through its many turmoils. Powder is too pure for this world, and may always will be. This is why this film worked so damn well to me, because it was lightly traumatic and emotional and it didn't pour it all on screen for people to gawk at and hail it as a masterpiece when it's really a freak show. The film approaches the material with a fearlessness, but also with a sense of tactfulness. This is a film made up of small moments in order to convey a story with a lot of heart, passion, and humanity. I was very moved by it.Powder is a powerful and quiet film for me, but it doesn't try to overstay it's welcome either. There are a lot of ideas in this film that are put forth, and many people may be frustrated by the fact that the film doesn't take the time to explore a lot of it. People have a similar problem with the Ken Russell film Altered States. I think that, in general, if you can at least establish the essence of what is going on and make the viewer at least feel that they are getting the chance to explore such heavy material that it doesn't matter to me if it works completely. For me, I appreciated the fact that this film brought so many ideas to the table without trying to dwell on them. This film wasn't meant to be like Sphere, which I personally found to be scary but which many people found to be preachy. Powder certainly isn't preachy, but it can be misconstrued for being that way due to the fact that it has it's occasional moments where it will dwell on certain characters and events. Many folks like to bring up a scene in which Powder passionately watches a young teen wring his wet shirt over his body and claim it to be homoerotic when in reality it is supposed to symbolize the fact that Powder doesn't have any bodily hair on him and wishes that he could have experienced what it would have been like to grow up and develop hair in various places on the body, which was a time in the lives of many adolescent boys that was unpleasant and unnerving. Ironically, the character of Powder is also judged after being witnessed gawking at the boy. I think that's one of the most challenging aspects of the film for a lot of people. There's an ominous temptation to read into aspects of the film that don't actually exist. There always will be with a Victor Salva film, and because of this I don't think that many people will unfortunately be able to ever comprehend how truly deep and powerful this film really is. However, the ending to Powder has an element of optimism to it. Powder is too pure and too innocent for this world to accept him, but the characters that surround him hold out hope that there is a place for someone like him to go where he will never be judged or harassed for who he is. I too hold out hope that one day people will accept this film and not judge it by the people attached to it. I accept the fact that people will do that and still won't like the film, and that's fine. However, I didn't like the film either when I was younger, and I didn't know anything about was Salva did. This film did much more than grow on me though. It moved me deeply.",4,One of the most misunderstood films I've seen,1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,10039,"['unusually', 'controversial', '90s', 'cult', 'classic', 'Powder', 'one', 'films', 'best',

395743,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,6304011431,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[1, 2]","""Powder"" is a deeply moving film about the very difficult topic of what we humans do when someone different is in our midst and we have to deal with him or her. Some people have difficulty with 'difference', and this can be the cause of much pain and suffering.The movie is basically dealing with this topic, while also offering some quasi-spiritual/psychological insights into the nature of the Universe and who we really are, specifically something like: ""All matter is energy. We are matter. Therefore, we are energy."" Whether or not you agree with this logic, it makes the premise of the 'difference' in the movie.Other reviewers discuss the plot and script, and their strong and weak points, but what I found outstanding in the movie was the character -- Sheriff Doug Barnum -- played brilliantly by Lance Henriksen.I think he has not received proper credit for the compelling job he has done in this film.Henriksen is mostly known for his roles in horror films (i.e. some of the Alien movie franchise, Pumpkinhead, Near Dark, etc.) and he can certainly play a ""baddie"" with conviction. He's always fun to watch and brings a lot of energy and menace to his roles. But his acting ability far exceeds these roles, and he has a much greater depth than the villains he plays - entertaining as they are.In ""Powder"", we get to see more of that wonderful depth as Henriksen delivers a stellar performance that stands out. This is a real accomplishment when you consider he is working with other powerful actors, including Jeff Goldblum, Mary Steenbergen, and Sean Patrick Flannery -- who also demand our attention. They are, of course, excellent. But Henriksen somehow brings something extra to his role, a spirit, an energy that compliments, yet rises above, these marvelous actors and their characters.The character that Henriksen plays, Sheriff Doug Barnum, is at heart a good and decent man, trying to honor his role as law officer and balance it with the tragedy in his personal life. As an officer, he must do what the law says, whether he agrees with it or not, but as a human being, he can do so with compassion and dignity. That is what Henriksen brings to the role and it is wonderful to watch.He is tough, no nonsense, strong, yet at times so compassionate and tender. Watch the scene between the Sheriff and his son as they reconcile their differences very carefully. Henriksen makes his character poignantly human, not just a part in a film. It is completely believable and heart wrenching. You really feel for the guy and what he is going through. This happens throughout the film.Of course, much of this is in the script, and is supported by the excellent musical score. The trick is to WATCH Henriksen closely, his facial expressions and his body language, the way he cocks his head, rolls his very expressive eyes. This is where his skills as an actor shine through. He delivers a beautiful performance filled with pathos and emotion, which is the strong point of the film.If you are a Lance Henriksen fan but are used to his horror roles, I think you will find this performance different and refreshing, and a tribute to his skill as an actor.And the movie is very good too.Enjoy!",5,Deeply Moving Film and Watch Lance Henriksen Walk Away With It,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2013,3196,"['Powder', 'deeply', 'moving', 'film', 'very', 'difficult', 'topic', 'what', 'humans', 'do', 'when', 'someone', 'different', 'midst', 'have', 'deal', 'people', 'have', 'difficulty', ""'difference"", 'can', 'be', 'cause', 'much', 'pain', 'suffering.The', 'movie', 'basically', 'dealing', 'topic', 'also', 'offering', 'quasi-spiritual/psychological', 'insights', 'nature', 'Universe', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'specifically', 'something', 'matter', 'energy', 'are', 'matter', 'Therefore', 'are', 'energy', 'Whether', 'not', 'agree', 'logic', 'premise', ""'difference"", 'movie.Other', 'reviewers', 'discuss', 'plot', 'script', 'strong', 'weak', 'points', 'what', 'found', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'was', 'character', 'Sheriff', 'Doug', 'Barnum', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Lance', 'Henriksen.I', 'think', 'not', 'received', 'proper', 'credit', 'compelling', 'job', 'done', 'film.Henriksen', 'mostly', 'known', 'roles', 'horror', 'films', 'i.e', 'Alien', 'movie', 'franchise', 'Pumpkinhead', 'Near', 'Dark', 'etc', 'can', 'certainly', 'play', 'baddie', 'conviction', 'always', 'fun', 'watch', 'brings', 'lot', 'energy', 'menace', 'roles', 'acting', 'ability', 'far', 'roles', 'much', 'greater', 'depth', 'villains', 'entertaining', 'are.In', 'Powder', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'wonderful', 'depth', 'Henriksen', 'stellar', 'performance', 'out', 'real', 'accomplishment', 'when', 'consider', 'working', 'other', 'powerful', 'actors', 'including', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Mary', 'Steenbergen', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flannery', 'who', 'also', 'demand', 'attention', 'are', 'course', 'excellent', 'Henriksen', 'somehow', 'something', 'extra', 'role', 'spirit', 'energy', 'compliments', 'rises', 'marvelous', 'actors', 'characters.The', 'character', 'Henriksen', 'Sheriff', 'Doug', 'Barnum', 'heart', 'good', 'decent', 'man', 'trying', 'honor', 'role', 'law', 'officer', 'balance', 'tragedy', 'personal', 'life', 'officer', 'must', 'do', 'what', 'law', 'not', 'human', 'being', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'compassion', 'dignity', 'what', 'Henriksen', 'role', 'wonderful', 'watch.He', 'tough', 'nonsense', 'strong', 'yet', 'times', 'so', 'compassionate', 'tender', 'Watch', 'scene', 'Sheriff', 'son', 'reconcile', 'differences', 'very', 'carefully', 'Henriksen', 'character', 'poignantly', 'human', 'not', 'just', 'part', 'film', 'completely', 'believable', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'really', 'feel', 'guy', 'what', 'going', 'film.Of', 'course', 'much', 'script', 'supported', 'excellent', 'musical', 'score', 'trick', 'WATCH', 'Henriksen', 'closely', 'facial', 'expressions', 'body', 'language', 'way', 'head', 'very', 'expressive', 'eyes', 'where', 'skills', 'actor', 'shine', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'filled', 'pathos', 'emotion', 'strong', 'point', 'film.If', 'are', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'fan', 'are', 'used', 'horror', 'roles', 'think', 'will', 'find', 'performance', 'different', 'refreshing', 'tribute', 'skill', 'actor.And', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'too.Enjoy']",Powder VHS

395745,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6304011431,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","""Powder"" was the first of two films that came out in 1995-1996 dealing with a gifted individual who is super-smart and has paranormal powers; the second was ""Phenomenon"" with John Travolta. ""Powder"" is the superior. While ""Phenomenon"" is good, ""Powder"" reaches for greatness and, in some ways, achieves it.Sean Patrick Flanery plays a hairless albino teen in East Texas, nicknamed Powder, who's discovered living in a basement after his grandfather's sudden death. As a ward of the state, he is placed in a boy's school where his uniqueness stirs up trouble.For a film like this to work you have to buy into the character, and this is one of the movie's strengths. Flanery reveals his acting expertise in his utterly convincing portrayal of the gifted teen. Seriously, Flannery's Powder stands strong with the greatest misfits in cinema, like Nimoy's Spock and Hank's Forrest Gump.Actually, the acting is great across the board: Lance Henriksen as the hardened-but-open sheriff, Mary Steenburgen as a psychologist who grows to really love Powder (in a motherly way),Jeff Goldblum as a science teacher who's astonished, Bradford Tatum as Powder's main enemy at school, Brandon Smith as a redneck deputy who instinctively hates him, but actually fears him, and the beautiful redhead Missy Crider, Powder's fellow student and potential love interest.Roger Ebert dissed the film for a number of reasons, one being Powder's enemy's don't learn from him. On the contrary, one enemy makes a 180 after being enlightened, but ultimately reverts back to his former base mentality. This happens all the time in real life. On another occasion Powder does something miraculous and you can clearly see the change on his enemy's face -- the realization & acceptance. Whether this will prove to be a lasting change or temporary, we'll never know.Ebert also complained that Powder's electrical tricks upstage his emotional insights. Really? I think it's the reverse. While the electrical tricks are there to maintain the attention of those with cinematic ADHD, it's the film's potent insights that stay with the viewer. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the electrical tricks, but they're way too overdone to be realistic. At the same time, I understand why the writer/director (Victor Salva) included them -- this is a MOVIE, not real life; it's meant to transfer ideas AND entertain, and it does both pretty effectively.Ebert also griped that the ending is unsatisfying the more you think about it. Actually, the ending makes a powerful statement and is reminiscent of the spectacular translations of Elijah and Enoch in the Bible. Let's just say Powder was too good, too spiritual, for the simpleminded and mundane.I'm not saying the film doesn't have flaws or roll-your-eyes moments, but they can be overlooked in view of the big picture and the film's successes.As for the paranormal phenomena featured in the story -- like psychokinesis, telepathy, extraordinary empathy and what the Bible calls ""the word of knowledge"" -- although some of these are exaggerated in the film I have a secret:They're real.=========================The film was shot in SE Texas and runs 111 minutes.GRADE: A-",5,"""Can't imagine there's meanness; can't imagine one lie""",1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,3171,"['Powder', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'came', 'out', '1995-1996', 'dealing', 'gifted', 'individual', 'who', 'super-smart', 'paranormal', 'powers', 'second', 'was', 'Phenomenon', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Powder', 'superior', 'Phenomenon', 'good', 'Powder', 'reaches', 'greatness', 'ways', 'achieves', 'it.Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'hairless', 'albino', 'teen', 'East', 'Texas', 'nicknamed', 'Powder', 'who', 'discovered', 'living', 'basement', 'grandfather', 'sudden', 'death', 'ward', 'state', 'placed', 'boy', 'school', 'where', 'uniqueness', 'up', 'trouble.For', 'film', 'work', 'have', 'buy', 'character', 'one', 'movie', 'strengths', 'Flanery', 'acting', 'expertise', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'portrayal', 'gifted', 'teen', 'Seriously', 'Flannery', 'Powder', 'strong', 'greatest', 'misfits', 'cinema', 'Nimoy', 'Spock', 'Hank', 'Forrest', 'Gump.Actually', 'acting', 'great', 'board', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'hardened-but-open', 'sheriff', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'psychologist', 'who', 'really', 'love', 'Powder', 'motherly', 'way', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'science', 'teacher', 'who', 'astonished', 'Bradford', 'Tatum', 'Powder', 'main', 'enemy', 'school', 'Brandon', 'Smith', 'redneck', 'deputy', 'who', 'instinctively', 'actually', 'beautiful', 'redhead', 'Missy', 'Crider', 'Powder', 'fellow', 'student', 'potential', 'love', 'interest.Roger', 'Ebert', 'dissed', 'film', 'number', 'reasons', 'one', 'being', 'Powder', 'enemy', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'contrary', 'one', 'enemy', '180', 'being', 'enlightened', 'ultimately', 'back', 'former', 'base', 'mentality', 'time', 'real', 'life', 'occasion', 'Powder', 'something', 'miraculous', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'change', 'enemy', 'face', 'realization', 'acceptance', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'lasting', 'change', 'temporary', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know.Ebert', 'also', 'complained', 'Powder', 'electrical', 'tricks', 'upstage', 'emotional', 'insights', 'Really', 'think', 'reverse', 'electrical', 'tricks', 'are', 'there', 'maintain', 'attention', 'cinematic', 'ADHD', 'film', 'potent', 'insights', 'stay', 'viewer', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'enjoy', 'electrical', 'tricks', ""'re"", 'way', 'too', 'overdone', 'be', 'realistic', 'same', 'time', 'understand', 'why', 'writer/director', 'Victor', 'Salva', 'included', 'MOVIE', 'not', 'real', 'life', 'meant', 'transfer', 'ideas', 'AND', 'entertain', 'pretty', 'effectively.Ebert', 'also', 'griped', 'ending', 'unsatisfying', 'more', 'think', 'Actually', 'ending', 'powerful', 'statement', 'reminiscent', 'spectacular', 'translations', 'Elijah', 'Enoch', 'Bible', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Powder', 'was', 'too', 'good', 'too', 'spiritual', 'simpleminded', 'mundane.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'flaws', 'roll-your-eyes', 'moments', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'view', 'big', 'picture', 'film', 'successes.As', 'paranormal', 'phenomena', 'featured', 'story', 'psychokinesis', 'telepathy', 'extraordinary', 'empathy', 'what', 'Bible', 'word', 'knowledge', 'are', 'exaggerated', 'film', 'have', 'secret', ""'re"", 'real.=========================The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'SE', 'Texas', '111', 'minutes.GRADE', 'A-']",Powder VHS
