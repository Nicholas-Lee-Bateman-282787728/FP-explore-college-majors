25596,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,0780021320,Andrew Raker,"[2, 4]","Broad Introductory Statements:Probably close to  of the dialogue is cut from this film version. Olivier is very loud, but not particularly emotionally expressive. As Henry, Olivier basically shouts the lines of many of Henry's famous speeches (ex: the ""tennis ball"" speech to the Dauphin's messenger, the speech to his soldiers at Harfleur, and his ""we band of brothers"" speech before the major battle scene). Olivier's Henry is very patriotic, courageous, and favorably portrayed. (Basically all scenes in the play that present Henry's character in a more complex light are eliminated.) The idea that God will provide the English victory (i.e. that God is on the side of the English) is hinted upon but not played up nearly so much as in the actually folio text.Notes and Changes from Folio Text:  **** REVEALS PLOT*****Play begins with an aerial shot of a model of London in the late 1500s. The camera zooms in to the Globe theatre where the beginning scenes of the play take place.Prologue is partially included, where the speaker asks the audience members to use their imaginations.During the earlier scenes, a good amount of comedy is included. For example, the Bishop of Ely loses his hat while backstage, since he has been called on stage but is running a little late because he wished to taste a last sip of (what is probably) wine.In a serious manner, King Henry (i.e. Lawrence Olivier) asks the bishops if he has a right to the crown of France.While explaining to King Henry why he has a right to the crown of France, the bishops engage in an interesting scene of comedy, in which they consistently forget which document to read next, as they try to prove that Henry's claim to the French crown is just. Eventually, the Bishop of Ely throws all the papers into the air in an act of desperation, which really makes the crowd laugh.The word ""dauphin"" is pronounced in its English accentuation - not the French accentuation.Unlike in the play, in this film adaptation, it is not Canterbury who instructs Henry to invoke the spirit of his ancestors.Scene where Pistol and Nim threaten to fight one another is still included. However, the scene is considerably cut.One really feels sorry for Sir John Falstaff as he lies on his deathbed, hallucinating about Henry's rejection of him.Sir John's companions really seem to lament his death in a more emotionally powerful manner than what the text would indicate.Scene 2.2. is almost entirely eliminated. The only portion of the scene that is included is the portion where Henry grants a pardon to a drunken man. [All references to the traitorous activities of Scrope, Cambridge, and Grey have been eliminated.]The French king is really portrayed as timid/meek and potentially mentally challenged. The other way to read the French king is as so old that his once capable intellect is no longer very capable. [Yet, either way, in this adaptation, it is clear that the French king is not nearly so capable a leader as King Henry - a clear contrast is made between these two monarchs.]In general, the French court is portrayed as stupid - filled with members who have nothing beneficial to do with their time.In this adaptation, the Dauphin appears quite timid as well after Exeter mocks him. For example, the Dauphin does not give his famous retort: ""I desire / Nothing but odds with England.""After Exeter delivers his message to King Charles, the French king faints. Clearly, this plays up the idea that King Charles is quite weak minded.In scene 3.2, the boy does not give his lengthy speech that demonstrates that Nim, Bardolph, and Pistol are cowards and petit thieves. Instead, the film shows Pistol running around with a broken sword. When Nim, Bardolph, and Pistol try to avoid fighting at Harfleur, soldiers force toward the fighting. One soldiers spanks (Pistol?) a few times with the broad side of his sword to make him move toward the fighting [obviously added for comic effect].Captain MacMorris really appears angry after Fluellen says: ""there is not many of your nation"" (3.3.60). Perhaps, Captain MacMorris should be angry because the film adaptation seems to indicate that Fluellen was trying to make MacMorris angry through the comment.Later in 3.3, Henry does not make threats to the mayor of Harfleur about his soldiers raping the women and impaling the children, if the mayor refuses to surrender. [Again, the intent is to portray Henry as very patriotic.]Alice's character is probably in her 60s. The text of the play does not signify how elderly Alice is, but one receives the impression that the Alice in this adaptation is probably more aged than what Shakespeare had in mind, especially since young male actors played the female roles.Alice and Catherine are in the garden picking flowers when they have the conversation about English body parts. The conversation, like in the text of the play, is mostly spoken in French. [Verify: I think the most controversial parts of the conversation (i.e. the foutre, and con parts) are eliminated.In scene 3.5, when the French nobles talk about how French women want to have sex with young English men (lines 28-30), the French ladies (including Catherine and Alice) are present and gasp at the accusation.The part of 3.6, in which Bardolph is hung is completed skipped. One never receives any indication that any of the first 100 lines of 3.6 ever occurred.Henry throws Montjoy a sack of coins after saying: ""So tell your master"" (3.6.152).In 3.7, the Dauphin is the one who lauds his horse and says his horse is his mistress. [Note: In most text versions of the play, Bourbon lauds the virtues of his horse since the Dauphin is not present.]French, after midnight, really insult the English and the intelligence of the English. However, the film adaptation clearly portrays that the French are the real bumbling idiots.In 4.1, Pistol never really gets to see Henry's face during the early morning conversation. During this conversation, Henry pronounces his assumed named ""Leroy"" rather than ""Le roi"". Perhaps, this is more interesting, but it does limit the humor of Pistol's response.A (unnamed?) teenage boy is the one who says: ""if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the King that led them to it"" (4.1.136-137). [In the text, Williams utters the lines in this conversation]In this film adaptation, Henry gives the speech where he says: ""Every subject's duty is the King's / but every subject's soul is his own"" (4.1.164-165). Of course, a good number of the lines of this speech are cut. Yet, the integrity of the ideas remains approximately the same.Henry and Williams do not exchange gloves. [Also, the portions of Act 4.7 and 4.8 that deals with the matter of the gloves are eliminated.]When Henry gives the speech in which he reflects upon his responsibility as king (end of 4.1), the viewer sees Henry's face. However, a voiceover provides the words (i.e. Henry does not move his lips).A very short scene is added in which churchmen are praying in Latin for King Henry's victory.Scene where Henry asks forgiveness for the crimes of his ancestors is skipped (4.1.275-287).Scene 4.2 is largely eliminated. A few lines are kept.Henry shouts his famous speech in 4.3 ""What's he that wishes so?"" in front of hundreds of his troops. [In play, it is not clear how many soldiers would actually hear his words.]In another comic scene, Henry's horse seems to shake its head ""no"" after Montjoy gives his final appeal that Henry allow himself to be ransomed. Also, Montjoy, when presenting his appeal does not insult Henry about the proposed random not being large enough for the crimes that England committed against the French.Scenes 4.4 and 4.6 are excluded. Scene 4.5 is partially included, although the Dauphin speaks some of Bourbon's lines (at least according to the Norton text).Scene in which the French nobles murder all the boys is shown.After Henry finds out that the boys have been murdered, he goes back to the battlefield (where the fighting is still continuing) and fight even more diligently (clearly very angry at the French for what they had done).[Overall, the battle scene is nearly as realistic as the battle in the Branagh 1989 adaptation - perhaps a bit less so but not really a horrible battle scene.]Film conveys that the number of English deaths  (excluding the nobles) were ""5 and 20 score"" (i.e. 405). In the text of the play, the number is 5 and 20 (i.e. 25).Scene 5.0 is largely skipped.Scene 5.1 is included. In this scene, Fluellen strikes Pistol over his head with the handle of Pistol's own sword (~ very comic). Pistol is forced to eat a leek. Pistol discovers that his wife has died. Pistol utters the famous line: ""To England will I steal, and there I'll steal"" (5.1.78).In Scene 5.2, the Duke of Burgundy correctly focuses upon the decaying nature of France during the war. As the Duke speaks the words, the audience is presented with images of the decaying of France.Henry shakes his head ""yes"" when he asks Queen Isabel if she wants to go with King Charles to review the articles of peace. Henry shakes his head ""no"" when he asks her if she wants to stay (5.2.91).Catherine and Anne seem shocked after Henry tries to kiss Catherine's hand and later suggests kissing her lips.Visual scene is included in which Henry and Catherine walk to their thrones with their crowns upon their heads. They look at one another and sit down upon their thrones, with a bishop [of Canterbury?] between their thrones with a look of satisfaction on his face.Film shifts back to the stage, where part of the epilogue is given (although not the part that tells how advisors to the young Henry VI lost possession of France).After the epilogue, the camera shifts backward and out of the theatre and into the model of late 1500s England (i.e. the oppose of the way the film began).OVERALL:Worth one's time and money if one particularly appreciates Shakespeare. However, if you are looking for a more psychologically-complicated King Henry, I would definitely recommend the Branagh adaptation instead. If you want an adaptation that keeps the most text from the play, try the BBC circa 1980 adaptation.",4,Largely a period piece promoting English patriotism during WWII,1287273600,"10 17,

It gets a tad more complex as the bulk of the story is told by Chorus (Leslie Banks.) First time through the play I was surprise to find the content of the treasure chest given to Henry V by Lewis (Max Adrian) the French Dauphin.I am glad this is not my first exposure to Henry V or I may not have finished the film.We start out with miniatures of London and zoom in on what is recognizable as the globe. It starts out as a play that is a farce of the play. It is presented as a comedy. We wait patiently through the bulk of the introductory scenes just knowing that any minute it will become a movie. O.K. any minute now. Come on you can do it. And just as you are about to give up it finally becomes a movie with exadurated backdrops. By this time the dramatic introduction that should be set up has passed.Still even as a movie all the main characters (especially the French) portrayed as fops. The narrator the again is supposed to be moving the story along is short of an orator. We finally see our first horse.While eating for someone to act we get to have time to think where we have seen the actors before such as The Constable of France (Leo Genn) being in ""Green for Danger"" (1946).Finally they forget that this is a farce and just before the dawn of the battle of Agincourt Laurence Olivier actually acts and is in great form. You can really feel that you are there with Henry planning the battle. At least Henry comes alive and saves the film after wasting the introduction and build-up.There are sections of the play missing but that is understandable given the short time of the film. When the French attacked Henrys luggage, the pre-announcement was left out. After which his horsing around with The Constable of France was put in (maybe it is some version of the play but I do not recall).Again Laurence does an excellent job of wooing Princess Katherine played quite well by Renee Asherson.I still find myself watching the film over and again.---------------For those people interested in media I watched the Criterion version. They did not clean up all the scratches and dings. The voice over commentary gives value to the film. One point they make is that a little over half of the play was cut out.

25598,A1YB29BIDULEYE,0780021320,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[4, 5]","Besides Sir Laurence Olivier of course, the best thing about this movie is that it alternates between appearing as real and as a play in the Globe Theatre. Only Sir Laurence Olivier could manage this so smoothly and convincingly. That said, it may help to understand what happened before Henry V. Henry IV usurped the crown from Richard II. (Henry IV is of course Henry V's father.) Well, the eventual Henry V had spent a lot of time with rogues Bardolph, Pistol, Nym, and Falstaff (whose death we see in the film). Well, Henry IV faced revolts for what he had done, and he was overcome with sorrow and guilt over what he had done. One of Henry IV's last suggestions to Henry V was to unite England against a foreign foe to help unite them. (This may seem deplorable, but it was accepted in those times, and to some extent still is.) Well, as it turns out, the partially French Henry V IS the legitimate heir of the French throne, but France of course would rather choose someone of lower rank as their king. But France makes the mistake of mocking England and forcing Henry V's hand. This is when the scenery changes from a performed play to more realistic. Sir Laurence Olivier convincingly portrays Henry V's tremendous energy as well as the famous passages. (""Once more unto the breach dear friends...."") One scene of horror from the play that is omitted in this movie is when Henry V orders the execution of Bardolph for stealing a mere cross.  Moving on, France's plan (in the play as well as actual history) was to let Henry V get so far and then wear himself and his forces out. This helps make sense of the early victories followed by the weakened and vulnerable state of King Henry V and his forces. 4.1 is arguably the best scene in this play. This is the night before battle and Henry V disguises himself and converses with his men. Then comes the battle that is done surprisingly well with the limited resources back then. (And as in history, France's plan to let England wear itself out backfired miserably.) Then of course comes the tastefully funny scene where Henry V meets his to be wife Katharine. SIDE NOTE: In the reign of his son Henry VI, England was to lose all of France except Calais.

When I saw his version of ""Henry V"" in the theater, it was the first time I really came to appreciate the brilliance of William Shakespeare as a wordsmith. For me it was the way Shakespeare was meant to be, full of gritty realism. And a few years ago when I tried watching Lawrence Olivier's 1944 version on TV, I ended up turning it off after ten minutes or so, it seemed so cartoonish by comparison.But last night TCM broadcast Olivier's ""Henry V"" again, and this time I was determined to give it a chance. I'm glad I did. While I still much prefer Branagh's version, this earlier production is a perfect example of how an older film has to be considered in the context of the time it was made, namely during the German blitzkrieg. Under those wartime circumstances this film had to be made on the cheap, and it shows. In this version, Shakespeare's play begins as though one might actually be watching it performed for the first time in 1600 at the old Globe Theater. Eventually, through the magic of cinema, the story FAAAAADES into a slightly more realistic environment, but only slightly. For the most part the sets and painted backdrops retain a very theatrical quality, and only the Battle of Agincourt (filmed in the Irish countryside) has a purely realistic feel to it. And I must admit there were a few shots during that battle scene that I was quite impressed with, particularly the tracking shot of the French army picking up speed while on horseback and one great special effect involving swarms of English arrows.It must be noted that this production was designed in part to pump up the morale of the British troops during the war with Germany; therefore some of text that reflected a bit more poorly on the British was left out. The treacherous assassination plot against King Henry is gone, as are the king's horrific threats outside the gates of Har Fleur, and the hanging of one of Henry's own men for stealing from a church. Also gone is most of Chorus' denouement at the end of the play, in which he describes how the gains made by King Henry were sadly lost in the years to come.Still, despite these lapses and a lot of overacting, this version of ""Henry V"" kept my rapt attention through its nearly 2.5 hour length.

Olivier was an absolute genius, beginning the film as a theatrical production at the Globe Theater, England in 1600 and gradually opening it up into a full-fledged cinematic experience 20-25 minutes into the movie. Here, he uses an excellent supporting cast to round out the characters in the play: Felix Aylmer as Archbishop Of Canterbury, Leslie Banks as Chorus, Renee Asherson as Katherine, Harcourt Williams as King Charles VI, Russell Thorndike as the Duke Of Bourbon, John Laurie as Captain Jamie and Esmond Knight as Fluellen, some of whom would reappear in Olivier's ""Hamlet,"" with Olivier again at the helm. The famous line ""Once more unto the breach, dear friends"" and the Saint Crispian's Day Speech are included in this faithful adaptation of one of Shakespeare's best historical plays (besides ""Richard III"" which to my mind classifies more as a tragedy). Unfortunately, Olivier was under certain restrictions by the English government, which hindered him from depicting the English as brutal, as can be inferred from the scene in which Henry makes a violent, but empty threat to do horrible things to the people of Harfluer, should they refuse to surrender (the part where he makes the threat was never filmed, but the rest of the scene is included in the movie)which is entirely understandable, as England was in the midst of World War II and wanted Olivier to make a pro-war ""Henry V"" to boost the morale of their soldiers in battle. Kenneth Branagh's version of ""Henry V"" would certainly not be a bad viewing choice for anyone wishing to compare both films or just for a general movie fan. Some will complain about the many liberties taken with the text in both versions, but how much of a V Act play can be put into a 2-2/1/2 hour movie? Certainly not everything. Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet"" is the first (and only version of Shakespeare's plays, so far) to preserve the ENTIRE text of the play and transfer it to the silver screen, while throwing in some creative touches of his own (see my review on both versions of ""Hamlet"" and on Zeffirelli's, if you're looking for variety).In short, Sir Laurence Olivier's ""Henry V"" is the best version of the play, but by all means, view Branagh's interpretation, which adds in other details missing in Olivier's version, for those who want to see the battles, which are only implied in the play and absent from Olivier's version, as well.

25605,ANEZJYKUDNJYQ,0780021320,Jack Rice,"[58, 61]","This is a brilliantly conceived movie-within-a-play-within-a-movie that showcases the genius of Laurence Olivier.  Today's audiences are exposed mainly to Olivier the movie star. But if you want to see a purer form of acting, see Olivier the stage actor. This is possible by watching his Shakespeare plays on film.  And these films are by  Olivier the &quot;auteur,&quot; long before the title was coined.  Olivier's is the legacy to which Branaugh, the darling of the current generation, fancies himself the pretender.And lest you're expecting a camera pointed at a stage, don't worry. Olivier, who produced and directed most of his Shakespeare films, has actually used the film medium to enlarge his plays' visual scope, while maintaining the intimacy that is the essence of live theatre. Moreover, Olivier is mindful of how daunting the language of Shakespeare is for modern audiences and has modified much of the original script to be more comprehensible, while preserving the feel of Elizabethan English.Olivier's &quot;Henry V&quot; was to England what Eisentein's &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; was to Russia - a familiar history rendered as a national epic, for morale purposes, while audiences were fighting off the Germans during World War II.  There are other parallels. For example, both use static, formalized composition, in Henry V's case, meant to resemble the images in medieval illuminated manuscripts and books of Hours. (In Ivan's case, according to Kael, like Japanese Kabuki.) Thus, a soundstage &quot;exterior&quot; backdrop becomes a tableau that serves to enhance, with its flat perspective and subjective scale, the view we have of that fabulous Age of Chivalry, for which the play's Battle of Agincourt was the closing act.I've always sneered at the extravagant accolades which show business gives its own.

Up to that point, filmmakers had tried to translate the Bard to film, but failed to achieve any success.  Sir Laurence was given the task to create a film that would be pro war and pro England in order to bolster the spirits of the people during World War II.  While his version of Henry V is far from a faithful adaptation, it captures the essence of the play and was a tremendous critical and commercial success.  It showed Sir Laurence's tremendous talent not only as an actor but as a writer and director.  The film is a visual marvel, shot in glorious Technicolor, it opens with the play being performed on stage at the Globe Theater circa 1600 and then dissolves into the actual battlefields of Agincourt.  Through the years the film has come to be derided as just a piece of wartime English propaganda.  The film definitely was made to serve that type of purpose, but to simply classify in that vein is take away from the masterful job of producing a visually stunning and well crafted film that was very much on the cutting edge of filmmaking in 1945.

I'd have to disagree, there is a Max Reinhardt version of A Midsummer Night's Dream antedating Henry V and at least as good.  This version of Henry V was produced during WWII and was intended as a morale booster.  The screenplay is an edited version of Henry V with portions that show Henry's ruthlessness excised.  These include his orders to execute English traitors, the famous speech before Harfleur in which he threatens to kill all the inhabitants of the town, and this orders to kill French prisoners after the battle of Agincourt.  While one-sided, this is a successful production.  Henry is portrayed by the young and glamorous Olivier in a tremendously attractive performance.  The play is staged theatrically and in full Technicolor glory.  The other actors are very good.  This version is definitely worth seeing though the more recent Kenneth Branagh version is much closer to the original play.  If you're going to see or own one version, use the Branagh version.

I looked forward to see the Olivier film version but I was concerned that it might move along too quickly for me to follow.  As I sat back to watch the movie on TCM, I was treated to some background on how the film was produced in England at the height of WWII where just about everything was in scarce supply.  The many innovation that enabled the film to come off were impression as was the reminder that ""Henry V"" was an excellent choice for an audience challenged by the strife of war.It was the very beginning of ""Henry V"" that impressed me the most.  We view the play being presented at the Globe Theatre in Stratford on Avon and we view it as part of the rauscious audience.  The positive effects of this vantage point are numerous; we get a better sense of the humor when the audience periodically breaks out in laughter, we get a better sense of how Shakespeare wrote in various scenes to enhance its' impact on the audiences of his day (which were NOT the tuxedo wearing crowd that dropped a bundle to see Shakepeare at an exclusive theater),but mostly, we see the players playing to the audience.  The major problem with film versus on-stage production is the lack of interplay between audience and performers.  The actors tend to ham it up more for the humorous scenes and tighten the emotion more for the serious scenes.  Each side of the stage feeds on the output of the other and a well-produced play leaves all with a sense of a common-shared experience.  Not so when acting before a camera and that is why I was so impressed with this approach.Eventually the panorama of the battle field leads us away from the audience to the movie sets.  I was grateful for the introduction about the play that prefaced the movie because I understood the backdrop to me more of an artistic expression than a cheap attempt to kid us that it was a real background.  I suspect Olivier's approach to the play helped to raise the emotional level of the cast.  The ability of a leader to command the respect and inspiration of his troops was a major part of the play and it came through very well in this movie version.My one objection to the movie (and the play since this is how Skakepeare wrote it into the play) was the closing scenes.  Maybe it was to woo that same audience that shows up again at the end by adding a romantic angle to the drama.  However, I felt that ""Henry V"" was meant to end on the battle field of victory rather than the wedding chapel of a new alliance.  I suspose Shakespeare added that out of concern about how it would play in Paris.  Oh well, alls well that almost ends well (as well).",5,Unique,1153008000,"07 16, 2006",2006,2735,"['read', 'play', 'Henry', 'V', 'earlier', 'year', 'found', 'parts', 'very', 'stimulating', 'other', 'parts', 'somewhat', 'distracting', 'looked', 'forward', 'see', 'Olivier', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'concerned', 'might', 'move', 'along', 'too', 'quickly', 'follow', 'sat', 'back', 'watch', 'movie', 'TCM', 'was', 'treated', 'background', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'England', 'height', 'WWII', 'where', 'just', 'everything', 'was', 'scarce', 'supply', 'many', 'innovation', 'enabled', 'film', 'come', 'off', 'were', 'impression', 'was', 'reminder', 'Henry', 'V', 'was', 'excellent', 'choice', 'audience', 'challenged', 'strife', 'war.It', 'was', 'very', 'beginning', 'Henry', 'V', 'impressed', 'most', 'view', 'play', 'being', 'presented', 'Globe', 'Theatre', 'Stratford', 'Avon', 'view', 'part', 'rauscious', 'audience', 'positive', 'effects', 'vantage', 'point', 'are', 'numerous', 'get', 'better', 'sense', 'humor', 'when', 'audience', 'periodically', 'out', 'laughter', 'get', 'better', 'sense', 'how', 'Shakespeare', 'wrote', 'various', 'scenes', 'enhance', 'impact', 'audiences', 'day', 'were', 'NOT', 'tuxedo', 'wearing', 'crowd', 'dropped', 'bundle', 'see', 'Shakepeare', 'exclusive', 'theater', 'mostly', 'see', 'players', 'playing', 'audience', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'versus', 'on-stage', 'production', 'lack', 'interplay', 'audience', 'performers', 'actors', 'tend', 'ham', 'up', 'more', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'tighten', 'emotion', 'more', 'serious', 'scenes', 'side', 'stage', 'feeds', 'output', 'other', 'well-produced', 'play', 'sense', 'common-shared', 'experience', 'Not', 'so', 'when', 'acting', 'camera', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'approach.Eventually', 'panorama', 'battle', 'field', 'away', 'audience', 'movie', 'was', 'grateful', 'introduction', 'play', 'prefaced', 'movie', 'understood', 'backdrop', 'more', 'artistic', 'expression', 'cheap', 'attempt', 'kid', 'was', 'real', 'background', 'suspect', 'Olivier', 'approach', 'play', 'helped', 'raise', 'emotional', 'level', 'cast', 'ability', 'leader', 'command', 'respect', 'inspiration', 'troops', 'was', 'major', 'part', 'play', 'came', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'one', 'objection', 'movie', 'play', 'how', 'Skakepeare', 'wrote', 'play', 'was', 'closing', 'scenes', 'Maybe', 'was', 'woo', 'same', 'audience', 'up', 'again', 'end', 'adding', 'romantic', 'angle', 'drama', 'However', 'felt', 'Henry', 'V', 'was', 'meant', 'end', 'battle', 'field', 'victory', 'rather', 'wedding', 'chapel', 'new', 'alliance', 'suspose', 'Shakespeare', 'added', 'concern', 'how', 'would', 'play', 'Paris', 'Oh', 'well', 'alls', 'well', 'almost', 'well', 'well']",N/A

Olivier in period costume is mesmerizing.  As Shakespeare's bad-boy prince turned earnest King, Olivier takes charge and demands the return of English lands from the rather effeminate French nobility.  Outnumbered 10 to one, his merry band of Englishmen dispatches the Dolphin at Agincourt.  Then he courts the French speaking princess Katherine with broken French and elegant economy.The recreation of old London and the Globe Theatre was delightful.  The audience and players went on in heavy rains without complaint.

When Olivier filmed the play over 3 centuries later, England was threatened and the times again called for a patriotic rendering of what was always a patriotic play. Lord Olivier's version of Henry V , filmed during WWII, is remarkable on many levels. I found the opening where the play is actually being staged at the Globe to be a wonderfully creative approach to kicking this off before moving to more realistic live action. The acting is outstanding as would be expected and Olivier's Henry V is in total command. This for me was more enjoyable than Kevin Branaugh's more recent film version although I liked that as well.

25617,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0780021320,Robert Morris,"[40, 42]","From various reference sources, in brief, here's the historical background both to Shakespeare's play and to this film. Henry V, the eldest son of Henry IV and Mary Bohun, was born in 1387.  An accomplished and experienced soldier, at age fourteen he fought the Welsh forces of Owen Glendower; at age sixteen he commanded his father's forces at the battle of Shrewsbury; and shortly after his accession he put down a major Lollard uprising and an assassination plot by nobles still loyal to Richard II . He proposed to marry Catherine in 1415, demanding the old Plantagenet lands of Normandy and Anjou as his dowry. Charles VI refused and Henry declared war, opening yet another chapter in the Hundred Years' War. His invasion of France served two purposes: to regain lands lost in previous battles and to focus attention away from any of his cousins' royal ambitions. Henry, possessed a masterful military mind and defeated the French at the Battle of Agincourt in October of 1415. By 1419 he had captured Normandy, Picardy, and much of the Capetian stronghold of the Ile-de-France.By the time when the Treaty of Troyes was signed in 1420, Charles VI not only accepted Henry as his son-in-law but passed over his own son to name Henry heir to the French crown. Had Henry lived a mere two months longer, he would have been king of both England and France. However, he had prematurely aged because of having lived the hard life of a soldier, became seriously ill, and died after returning from yet another French campaign. Catherine had given birth to his only son while he was away but Henry died without ever seeing the child.The historian Rafael Holinshed, in Chronicles of England, summed up Henry V's reign as follows: &quot;This Henry was a king, of life without spot, a prince whom all men loved, and of none disdained, e captain against whom fortune never frowned, nor mischance once spurned, whose people him so severe a justicer both loved and obeyed (and so humane withal) that he left no offence unpunished, nor friendship unrewarded; a terror to rebels, and suppressor of sedition, his virtues notable, his qualities most praiseworthy.&quot;It would be a disservice to compare and contrast this film with the version which Kenneth Branagh directed 45 years later. Each has its own unique strengths and both are worthy of high regard. The year is 1413. As Shakespeare's play begins, newly crowned Henry V (Olivier) attempts to resolve animosities between England and France. In the film, however, Olivier creates a truly magical introduction which enables us to wend our way out of London and across the fields to a performance at the Globe Theatre. Once inside, we observe the audience around us but he also takes us backstage as the actors prepare. Following a welcome greeting by Chorus (Leslie Banks), the brief portrayal of a live performance continues as a film in 15th century England. This is a brilliant device. For many years, I showed this opening sequence to my English students before their reading of one of Shakespeare's plays. The ""You Are There"" effects are compelling and unforgettable.The quality of acting throughout the cast is outstanding, notably Olivier, Robert Newton (Pistol), Renee Asherton (Princess Katherine), Esmond Knight (Fluellyn), Leslie Banks (Chorus), and Felix Aylmer (Archbishop of Canterbury). Special note should also be made of the cinematography (Jack Hilyard and Robert Krasker) and production design (Carmen Dillon), given the severe limits on what could be done (and what could not be done) when producing a film in England during World War Two.Whereas Branagh chose to film Shakespeare's play in intensely human terms, and does so with great skill, Olivier takes a more formal approach after the initial scenes discussed earlier. His is a more regal Henry V, cunning as well as eloquent to be sure, but (or so it seems to me) a far more mature, self-assured monarch. Stated another way, Branagh's style reminds me of Mel Gibson as Hamlet or Braveheart whereas Olivier's style reminds me of, well yes, Olivier: In total self-control and of all he surveys. Never for a single moment did I doubt that his Henry V would conquer the French and wed Katherine.

It won Olivier an Academy Honorary Award for ""his outstanding achievement as actor, producer, and director in bringing Henry V to the screen.""""Henry V"" is the only history play that doesn't revolve around the seizure of the crown.  Hal, the young rebel of ""Henry IV"" has become the hero of Agincourt (a place in Northern France), where the English, against all odds, defeat the French (France's casualties 10,000; England's, 25).This play is also a masculine play.  It has only four women, and they all have small parts.Olivier designed this film for people who believed that ""Shakespeare was not for the likes of them,"" and it is said to be one of the most likeable Shakespearean movies ever made.  It has a ""we can lick 'em"" attitude, not surprising, since it was made at the request of then Prime Minister Winston Churchill in a effort to boost British morale in 1943.  All the guts and glory, myths, and clich&eacute;s about patriotism come vividly to life.  The English are portrayed as manly and true, the French (read Nazi) as ridiculous.Since, as has been mentioned, this movie was meant to be a morale booster, Olivier intentionally left out some of Henry's harsher traits as Shakespeare wrote them in the actual play.  As a result, the essence of the play is retained but it has been trimmed to nearly half its length.  (This is good because the movie would have been far too long.)The film opens with Olivier as the actor who originally played Henry V in the Globe Theatre (built in 1599 by Shakespeare's theatrical company).  Olivier's acting here is intentionally wooden.  This part, which has lines not from the play, is brilliant.  This introductory part (that lasts about fifteen minutes) provides a transition to the actual play itself (especially helpful for the people not familiar with the plays before this one).As the play-within-the-movie progresses, something extraordinary happens.  The viewer's involvement deepens, the Globe becomes the actual globe itself: the stage disappears, the setting grows increasingly naturalistic, and the actor PLAYING Henry BECOMES Henry.  And to show that our imagination need not be confined to reality, the film bursts through the constraints of realism, ending at the French court, seemingly a dream kingdom.By the end, we are returned to the Globe Theatre (where the movie began), suggesting that our imaginations must inevitably return to Earth.This movie was filmed in glorious Technicolor (a color film process popular at this time the movie was made).  The costumes and music score as well as the fighting scenes are spectacular.  (Note that Olivier directly modeled his appearance of Henry V on the portrait of the actual Henry V found in the National Portrait Gallery.)Finally, the DVD (the one released in 1999) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has five extras with the commentary being excellent.BOTTOM LINE:This movie is a worthy addition to the Bard's cinematic canon.(1944;  2 hr, 15 min;  full screen;  42 scenes)&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>>XXXXX",5,The first Shakespearean play to be made into a successful movie!!,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",2009,3819,"['XXXXX', 'few', 'happy', 'few', 'band', 'brothers', 'today', 'blood', 'meShall', 'be', 'brother', 'be', ""ne'er"", 'so', 'vile', 'day', 'shall', 'gentle', 'condition', 'gentlemen', 'England', 'now', 'a-bedShall', 'think', 'accurs', 'were', 'not', 'here', 'hold', 'manhoods', 'cheap', 'speaksThat', 'fought', 'Saint', 'Crispin', 'day', 'above', 'just', 'one', 'speeches', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'exciting', 'movie', 'based', 'William', 'Shakespeare', '1564', '1616', 'history', 'play', 'Henry', 'V', 'circa', '1599', '.The', 'actual', 'on-screen', 'title', 'movie', 'Chronicle', 'History', 'King', 'Henry', 'Fift', 'Battell', 'Fought', 'Agincourt', 'France', 'actually', 'title', '1600', 'quarto', 'edition', 'small', 'book', 'version', 'play', 'movie', 'stars', 'Sir', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'won', 'Olivier', 'Academy', 'Honorary', 'Award', 'outstanding', 'achievement', 'actor', 'producer', 'director', 'bringing', 'Henry', 'V', 'screen', 'Henry', 'V', 'only', 'history', 'play', ""n't"", 'revolve', 'seizure', 'crown', 'Hal', 'young', 'rebel', 'Henry', 'IV', 'become', 'hero', 'Agincourt', 'place', 'Northern', 'France', 'where', 'English', 'odds', 'defeat', 'French', 'France', 'casualties', '10,000', 'England', '25', '.This', 'play', 'also', 'masculine', 'play', 'only', 'four', 'women', 'have', 'small', 'parts.Olivier', 'designed', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'believed', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'not', 'likes', 'said', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'likeable', 'Shakespearean', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'can', 'lick', 'attitude', 'not', 'surprising', 'was', 'made', 'request', 'then', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Winston', 'Churchill', 'effort', 'boost', 'British', 'morale', '1943', 'guts', 'glory', 'myths', 'clich', 'eacute', 'patriotism', 'come', 'vividly', 'life', 'English', 'are', 'portrayed', 'manly', 'true', 'French', 'read', 'Nazi', 'ridiculous.Since', 'been', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'morale', 'booster', 'Olivier', 'intentionally', 'left', 'out', 'Henry', 'harsher', 'traits', 'Shakespeare', 'wrote', 'actual', 'play', 'result', 'essence', 'play', 'retained', 'been', 'trimmed', 'nearly', 'length', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'Olivier', 'actor', 'who', 'originally', 'played', 'Henry', 'V', 'Globe', 'Theatre', 'built', '1599', 'Shakespeare', 'theatrical', 'company', 'Olivier', 'acting', 'here', 'intentionally', 'wooden', 'part', 'lines', 'not', 'play', 'brilliant', 'introductory', 'part', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'transition', 'actual', 'play', 'especially', 'people', 'not', 'familiar', 'plays', 'one', 'play-within-the-movie', 'progresses', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'happens', 'viewer', 'involvement', 'deepens', 'Globe', 'actual', 'globe', 'stage', 'setting', 'increasingly', 'naturalistic', 'actor', 'PLAYING', 'Henry', 'BECOMES', 'Henry', 'show', 'imagination', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'confined', 'reality', 'film', 'constraints', 'realism', 'ending', 'French', 'court', 'seemingly', 'dream', 'end', 'are', 'returned', 'Globe', 'Theatre', 'where', 'movie', 'began', 'suggesting', 'imaginations', 'must', 'inevitably', 'return', 'Earth.This', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'glorious', 'Technicolor', 'color', 'film', 'process', 'popular', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'costumes', 'music', 'score', 'as', 'well', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'spectacular', 'Note', 'Olivier', 'directly', 'modeled', 'appearance', 'Henry', 'V', 'portrait', 'actual', 'Henry', 'V', 'found', 'National', 'Portrait', 'Gallery', 'Finally', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', '1999', 'perfect', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'five', 'extras', 'commentary', 'being', 'excellent.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'movie', 'worthy', 'addition', 'Bard', 'cinematic', 'canon', '1944', '2', 'hr', '15', 'min', 'full', 'screen', '42', 'scenes', 'lt', 'lt', 'Stephen', 'Pletko', 'London', 'Ontario', 'Canada', '>', '>', 'XXXXX']",N/A
