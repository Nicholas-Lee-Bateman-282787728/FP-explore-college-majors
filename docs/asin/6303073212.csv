The story holds together and pulls you along with ease.  My appreciation of the actors has been advanced after seeing this wonderful film.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you can be prepared to laugh but keep a box of tissues handy--they will be necessary.  Is the movie sad?  No, it is real and real life does not always make us laugh or cry, but the tenderness of this show will moisten your eyes unless you are dead.  While the whole movie is superb, you will not soon forget nor disregard the ending.I saw this for the first time the other day.  I tried to tell my kids about it tonight.  I coulsn't finish without breaking down.  This is the most moving movie I've seen.  Why did I wait so long to see it?  Amazon needs to change the rating system!

A story to teach younger generations why they deserve our praise, thanks, and respect. An emotional trek of a small group of war vets that accidentally meet in the Normandy location of their original acquaintance. The story seems to begin slow, due to the fact that we must find these characters as they collide in confrontation 50 years after the D-Day landing. Much has changed for them all, but some things have not. Some face survivor's guilt. A beautiful French set for this 1994 story that takes the minds of several survivors back 50 years to 1944. It is the changes, the eventual understandings, the the magical camaraderie that is expected to take place--after all it was a Masterpiece Theatre show.--A war memorial drama.--Heartwarming. It brings back the generation of my father that was there, and the 9000 that were killed or wounded on the Normandy beach sand. We see in this story, among a handful of travelers, a mini-resurgence of the cold war, then peace.A Foreign Field is not new, but that means a value can be found buying used. It's one to own, to watch each Memorial Day and Veterans Day. One to teach the next generation of the sacrifice of those who went before them.Huge stars, Alec Guiness (Star Wars), Leo McKern (Rumpole of the Bailey), Lauren Bacall, Edward Herrmann, Geraldine Chaplin, & John Randolph.",5,"Super cast, gripping emotion, and historically memorable",1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,1385,"['film', 'understand', 'men/women', 'who', 'fought', 'WWII', 'A', 'story', 'teach', 'younger', 'generations', 'why', 'deserve', 'praise', 'thanks', 'respect', 'emotional', 'trek', 'small', 'group', 'war', 'vets', 'accidentally', 'Normandy', 'location', 'original', 'acquaintance', 'story', 'begin', 'slow', 'due', 'fact', 'must', 'find', 'characters', 'collide', 'confrontation', '50', 'years', 'D-Day', 'landing', 'Much', 'changed', 'things', 'have', 'not', 'face', 'survivor', 'guilt', 'beautiful', 'French', 'set', '1994', 'story', 'minds', 'several', 'survivors', 'back', '50', 'years', '1944', 'changes', 'eventual', 'understandings', 'magical', 'camaraderie', 'expected', 'take', 'place', 'was', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'show.', 'A', 'war', 'memorial', 'drama.', 'Heartwarming', 'back', 'generation', 'father', 'was', 'there', '9000', 'were', 'killed', 'wounded', 'Normandy', 'beach', 'sand', 'see', 'story', 'handful', 'travelers', 'mini-resurgence', 'cold', 'war', 'then', 'peace.A', 'Foreign', 'Field', 'not', 'new', 'value', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'buying', 'used', 'one', 'own', 'watch', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'Veterans', 'Day', 'One', 'teach', 'next', 'generation', 'sacrifice', 'who', 'went', 'them.Huge', 'stars', 'Alec', 'Guiness', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'Rumpole', 'Bailey', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin', 'John', 'Randolph']",Foreign Field VHS

Growing up lucky enough to be exposed to Sir Alec's Ealing comedies, I felt I should try to score this. Not to mention the fact that the movie co-starred the late, great Leo McKern. I found a used copy via Amazon, & though the ex-rental tape doesn't track well, I'm not disappointed in the least. Sir Alec & McKern portray old comrades returning to Normandy. McKern is right out front, as an irascible, less than charming Rumpolesque figure. Sir Alec's character, Amos, is ""retarded"", but though we suspect war wounds, we don't get any info along this line until late in the film. The rest of the ensemble cast works amazingly well, even Geraldine Chaplin, who has grated on me in everything since Dr. Zhivago. FDR, excuse me, Edward Herrman, is very good, as are Lauren Bacall, Jeanne Moreau, and John Randolph. The moving look at the return of old soldiers to ""a foreign field"" behind Sword or Juno beach is reminiscent of ex-private James Ryan visiting Capt James Miller's gravesite in ""Saving Private Ryan"". I don't know, but I think Sir Alec Guinness was very ill when this was filmed. He says very few words, but his subdued, almost delicate Amos says volumes without verbalizing.

Listed as a comedy - yes, it does have it's funny moments but I would classify it more as classic ""comfort food"".  I think this is a movie for anyone who has loved someone who has seen action, died in action or been in action. The acting is superb, the story is absolutely perfect and it should not be missed.  I would recommend it to anyone over perhaps 16 - but only because I think a younger person could not understand the drama involved.",5,A Foreign Field - movies at their absolute best,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,529,"['now', 'become', 'time', 'favorite', 'movie', 'Amazing', 'emotions', 'can', 'stir', 'up', 'Listed', 'comedy', 'yes', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'would', 'classify', 'more', 'classic', 'comfort', 'food', 'think', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'loved', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'action', 'died', 'action', 'been', 'action', 'acting', 'superb', 'story', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'perhaps', '16', 'only', 'think', 'younger', 'person', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'drama', 'involved']",Foreign Field VHS

For starters, the cast is impressive and each member does a superb job.
