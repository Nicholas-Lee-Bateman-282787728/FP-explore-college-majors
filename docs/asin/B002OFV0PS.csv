1280873,A25FAJE4T2C6LU,B002OFV0PS,Aaron J. Krohn,"[0, 1]","""I Can't Think Straight"" is a good lesbian love affair movie which could've been a whole lot better.The story is of a Christian Arab (Jordanian) girl (Tala) who's on her 4th engagement, and isn't perfectly happy  with this one either!(She'd dumped the first 3, usually on or near the day of their wedding!)The other woman (Leyla) is a shy but confident Muslim from Israel, who is striving to be a novelist.They meet while living in London (through a mutual friend), fall in love, break up, then resolve everything at the end.It has the makings of a wonderful little movie, except ""I Can""t Think Straight"" got the recipe wrong.First, it's too short, at 80 minutes.  Another 20 to 30 minutes would've helped.Second, it can't decide whether it's a drama with comedic elements, or a comedy with dramatic elements.The housekeeper has some hilarious scenes, enhanced by her facial gestures.But Tala's mom makes some anti-semitic remarks in Leyla's presence.This brings out equally disparaging remarks by Tala about Israel's penchant for ""murdering children""!!While discussion of Israeli-Arab disunity is welcome, it doesn't quite fit in a romantic comedy!!Third, there's just one really serious bedroom scene, yet both actresses remain almost fully clothed--not a bare breast or rear end in sight!!While nudity and graphic sex aren't really necessary in a great lesbian movie, heat is enhanced by the rubbing of two bodies together.  These women barely even touch each other, for the most part.Add a half hour to ""flesh out"" (pun intended!) the story, do a bit of revision, and you've got yourself a potential 5-star movie!!But it's still worth your time!!",3,Not as good as it could've been...,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,1650,"['Ca', ""n't"", 'Think', 'Straight', 'good', 'lesbian', 'love', 'affair', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'whole', 'lot', 'story', 'Christian', 'Arab', 'Jordanian', 'girl', 'Tala', 'who', '4th', 'engagement', ""n't"", 'perfectly', 'happy', 'one', 'either', ""'d"", 'dumped', 'first', '3', 'usually', 'day', 'wedding', 'other', 'woman', 'Leyla', 'shy', 'confident', 'Muslim', 'Israel', 'who', 'striving', 'be', 'novelist.They', 'meet', 'living', 'London', 'mutual', 'friend', 'fall', 'love', 'break', 'up', 'then', 'resolve', 'everything', 'end.It', 'makings', 'wonderful', 'little', 'movie', 'Can', 't', 'Think', 'Straight', 'got', 'recipe', 'wrong.First', 'too', 'short', '80', 'minutes', '20', '30', 'minutes', 'would', ""'ve"", 'helped.Second', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'drama', 'comedic', 'elements', 'comedy', 'dramatic', 'elements.The', 'housekeeper', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'enhanced', 'facial', 'gestures.But', 'Tala', 'mom', 'anti-semitic', 'remarks', 'Leyla', 'presence.This', 'out', 'equally', 'disparaging', 'remarks', 'Tala', 'Israel', 'penchant', 'murdering', 'children', 'discussion', 'Israeli-Arab', 'disunity', 'welcome', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Third', 'just', 'one', 'really', 'serious', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'yet', 'actresses', 'remain', 'almost', 'fully', 'clothed', 'not', 'bare', 'breast', 'rear', 'end', 'sight', 'nudity', 'graphic', 'sex', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary', 'great', 'lesbian', 'movie', 'heat', 'enhanced', 'rubbing', 'two', 'bodies', 'together', 'women', 'barely', 'even', 'touch', 'other', 'most', 'part.Add', 'half', 'hour', 'flesh', 'out', 'pun', 'intended', 'story', 'do', 'bit', 'revision', ""'ve"", 'got', 'potential', '5-star', 'movie', 'still', 'worth', 'time']",N/A

1280880,ADJ9W8DJJKDJO,B002OFV0PS,Erika Young,"[7, 15]","The real agenda in this movie is not lesbian relationships and social acceptance, but anti-Semitism and anti-Israel propaganda. At every conversation, the Arab characters are saying something derogatory about the Jews or Israel. Their lies and hateful remarks are very reminiscent of Nazi propaganda. Example of what the Arabs in the movie said; ""Israelis kill children, so that's why the Palestinians suicide bombers are justified in killing Israeli children, who grow up to be soldiers"". Or; ""The last thing we need are more Jews in the Middle East"" or; ""Israel stole the Palestinians land"". Everyone who knows anything about Israeli history, Jewish people and the atrocities of the Palestinians knows there is nothing further from the truth.Even when one character is ""defending"" Israel she still lies! She said; ""Israel is the closest thing to democracy in the middle east"". Excuse me, correction; ISRAEL IS A DEMOCRACY, ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE,  WHILE EVERY SINGLE ARAB OR MOSLEM COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS A DICTATORSHIP (excluding  Turkey, which is a Moslem but not Arab country, and has a relative democracy, not a real democracy like Israel).One of the Arab women in the movie has a Jewish boyfriend and she wants to marry him, but she is DISGUSTED, because he wants to raise their future kids Jewish.Enough said, I rest my case!The Arab Palestinian characters are Christians from Jordan, not Moslems like almost all Palestinians are, and are played by Canadian actors from Indian decent, and that's why they appear so westernized, wealthy and well educated. Again, this is not depicting reality even remotely. And why are they spewing pro-Palestinian propaganda, since Jordan has had a lasting peace with Israel for the last 19 years? It's all very questionable!As far as the Lesbian subject, it is also very unrealistic; the 2 young gorgeous women had no gay tendencies at all until they meet, and out of the blue fall in love and want to spend the rest of their lives together. Again, very unrealistic and unbelievable. The only people who would like this movie are the ones who enjoy looking at sex scenes with 2 beautiful women. Since I am not one of these people, I didn't care for this movie at all and stopped watching it midway. The hateful anti-Semitism made me very angry and I just didn't want to waste another minute on this crap. It is shameful how the Arab lesbian director built this whole ridiculous fantasy about the ""admirable, glorious, innocent Palestinians"" who are victimized by the ""blood thirsty Jews"".Ha ha...it should be billed as a black comedy.",1,"The real agenda is anti-Semitism propaganda, not Lesbian relationships",1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,2596,"['real', 'agenda', 'movie', 'not', 'lesbian', 'relationships', 'social', 'acceptance', 'anti-Semitism', 'anti-Israel', 'propaganda', 'conversation', 'Arab', 'characters', 'are', 'saying', 'something', 'derogatory', 'Jews', 'Israel', 'lies', 'hateful', 'remarks', 'are', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Nazi', 'propaganda', 'Example', 'what', 'Arabs', 'movie', 'said', 'Israelis', 'kill', 'children', 'why', 'Palestinians', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'are', 'justified', 'killing', 'Israeli', 'children', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'soldiers', 'last', 'thing', 'need', 'are', 'more', 'Jews', 'Middle', 'East', 'Israel', 'stole', 'Palestinians', 'land', 'Everyone', 'who', 'anything', 'Israeli', 'history', 'Jewish', 'people', 'atrocities', 'Palestinians', 'knows', 'nothing', 'further', 'truth.Even', 'when', 'one', 'character', 'defending', 'Israel', 'still', 'said', 'Israel', 'closest', 'thing', 'democracy', 'middle', 'east', 'Excuse', 'correction', 'ISRAEL', 'DEMOCRACY', 'ALWAYS', 'HAS', 'BEEN', 'AND', 'ALWAYS', 'WILL', 'BE', 'EVERY', 'SINGLE', 'ARAB', 'OR', 'MOSLEM', 'COUNTRY', 'IN', 'THE', 'MIDDLE', 'EAST', 'DICTATORSHIP', 'excluding', 'Turkey', 'Moslem', 'not', 'Arab', 'country', 'relative', 'democracy', 'not', 'real', 'democracy', 'Israel', '.One', 'Arab', 'women', 'movie', 'Jewish', 'boyfriend', 'marry', 'DISGUSTED', 'raise', 'future', 'kids', 'Jewish.Enough', 'said', 'rest', 'case', 'Arab', 'Palestinian', 'characters', 'are', 'Christians', 'Jordan', 'not', 'Moslems', 'almost', 'Palestinians', 'are', 'are', 'played', 'Canadian', 'actors', 'Indian', 'decent', 'why', 'appear', 'so', 'westernized', 'wealthy', 'well', 'educated', 'Again', 'not', 'depicting', 'reality', 'even', 'remotely', 'why', 'are', 'spewing', 'pro-Palestinian', 'propaganda', 'Jordan', 'had', 'lasting', 'peace', 'Israel', 'last', '19', 'years', 'very', 'questionable', 'As', 'far', 'Lesbian', 'subject', 'also', 'very', 'unrealistic', '2', 'young', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'had', 'gay', 'tendencies', 'meet', 'blue', 'fall', 'love', 'want', 'spend', 'rest', 'lives', 'together', 'Again', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'unbelievable', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'movie', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'enjoy', 'looking', 'sex', 'scenes', '2', 'beautiful', 'women', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'stopped', 'watching', 'midway', 'hateful', 'anti-Semitism', 'made', 'very', 'angry', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'minute', 'crap', 'shameful', 'how', 'Arab', 'lesbian', 'director', 'built', 'whole', 'ridiculous', 'fantasy', 'admirable', 'glorious', 'innocent', 'Palestinians', 'who', 'are', 'victimized', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'Jews', '.Ha', 'ha', 'should', 'be', 'billed', 'black', 'comedy']",N/A

What does this film have that I love? Beautiful woman, romantic storyline, beautiful backdrops, romantic and erotic lovemaking (that's not explicit but still very erotic), a compelling storyline, but most of all, a happy ending.  The movie concerns two women, one an English Christian Jordanian, the other an English Muslim Indian, who fall in love but feel stiffled by their respective cultures, religions and family and the expected roles they are supposed to play (be straight and marry).  Falling in love is so out of their expectations, they both freak out a bit but their attraction to each other is undeniable. Lisa Ray is the PERFECT romantic lead and is quite fetching and debonair as Tala and I ate her up in this movie.  I only had a few minor issues with this DVD, namely it was too short (this movie is less than 90 minutes long) and my DVD crapped out of me, which had never happened to me before (I own about 350 DVDs). Despite that, I did not hesitate to buy another copy of this wonderful movie.  Like the title of my says, this is one of my favorite lesbian movies, which is saying a lot.

She has been engaged 3 times before and has broken off the engagements just before marriage. Her family hopes this marriage will go through.Leyla - a 16-year-old British Indian woman living in London (The actress is obviously not 16 and whenever the dialogue mentioned she is 16, I found myself surprised. She looks late 20s/early 30s.)I liked the movie, but I think there is a bit of room for improvement. Character development was lacking and the plot line jumps around a bit making you feel a bit lost at times. But - with that said and the fact that there are not many decent lesbian movies out there - I think this movie is definitely worth watching.The two women meet on a double date to play tennis. Instantly there is competition and challenge between them. Tala is the one who comes across as a billy to the younger Leyla. I felt like the two women were disliking each other and then all-of-a-sudden they are going away together staying in the same hotel room. And then they have a few moments of dancing together in the hotel room and then there is kissing and desire. It seemed to come out of nowhere. I think the author thought the competition was the smoldering embers of desire, but it didn't seem that way to me.The love scene between the two women is a collage of images of the two of them kissing and caressing. Nice to watch, don't get me wrong, but I would have preferred a real love scene that showed a blooming of their passion along with some hesitation about what they were getting into. Considering this was Leyla's first sexual experience with a woman (and maybe even with anyone) she seemed right at home with what was unfolding and had no hesitation about what to do. I can see that the director did not necessarily want this to be a coming-of-age movie, but there could have been a moment or two spent to show the epiphany of Leyla's realization that she is a lesbian.I give the movie a lot of artistic license and forgive a lot of the plot shortcomings because the actresses are both very attractive and there is chemistry between the two actresses.Both of the women are very privileged and come from rich families. Their heritage plays into the difficulties with family expectations in pursuing a lesbian lifestyle. But the fact that both of their families are filthy rich and that each of the women's fathers adore them help to cushion their coming out experience and make it relatively easy.
