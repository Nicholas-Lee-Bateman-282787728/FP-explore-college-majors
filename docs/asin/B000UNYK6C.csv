1095712,A2CL31ZUL0TQHP,B000UNYK6C,"Biff Fearless ""World Reknowned Adventurer""","[3, 3]","Having recently developed an interest in Poker, I have started watching a few movies about the game. Seeing that it ""starred"" Michael Madsen and Louis Gossett, Jr. gave me some hope for the film, but I was soon to learn that these actors are more supporting players (almost cameo) rather than featured performers. Dominique Swain stars as ""Ace"" the daughter of a professional gambler who tries to pay her way through med school by playing Texas Hold 'Em. To me, the biggest flaw of the movie is the part set in the learning hospital. The acting and storyline are so over the top that it is very hard to take seriously, despite a very dark subject matter. If this type of thing was going to be introduced, it needed to be treated more significantly than the Poker games.And what about those Poker games? The games are very shallow in the movie, but are at least moderately entertaining as ""Ace"" tries to win a big tournament. If you are a serious student of the game you will not find the sequences authentic, but then the recent spate of poker movies are really just in the vein of most Hollywood sports movies. Holding it to too high of a standard isn't really fair either.",2,All in?

1095715,A1HOLE9R6WPT85,B000UNYK6C,Mad Max,"[0, 0]","A great idea for a movie (also see [[ASIN:B0002DRDB4 Rounders]). A bunch of poor med students try to put together a ""dream team"" of card players to help with tuition.But the execution was extremely poor, and the acting was pretty bad. There was hardly any strategy, and both the ""dream team"" and the card playing took a back seat to an awful plot development between the main character & her long-lost father.It's hard to imagine how you can mess up such a simple plot, but they actually managed to make the movie a bit confusing. Card players will definitely be disappointed with this one. Actually, I'm not sure who to recommend this to.",2,Very few nice things to say about this movie,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",2008,639,"['great', 'idea', 'movie', 'also', 'see', '[', '[', 'ASIN', 'B0002DRDB4', 'Rounders', ']', 'bunch', 'poor', 'med', 'students', 'try', 'put', 'together', 'dream', 'team', 'card', 'players', 'help', 'execution', 'was', 'extremely', 'poor', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'bad', 'was', 'hardly', 'strategy', 'dream', 'team', 'card', 'playing', 'took', 'back', 'seat', 'awful', 'plot', 'development', 'main', 'character', 'long-lost', 'father.It', 'hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'can', 'mess', 'up', 'such', 'simple', 'plot', 'actually', 'managed', 'make', 'movie', 'bit', 'confusing', 'Card', 'players', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'one', 'Actually', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'recommend']",All In

I suppose it is like seeing a movie about a war...in reality the movie would have flaws if you are a combat soldier but to the layman it is entertaining. So it is with this movie.
