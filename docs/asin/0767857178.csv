This movie is great and with Jackie Chan directing it, well it just cannot fail to be a hit. It is a case of being in the right place at the right time for the charactor Jackie plays in it. Conned out of his last few dollars and destitute all this changes when a lady gives him a rose for luck. He finds himself the leader of one of the top mobs and goes from rags to riches. The only thing is that this gang leader will not go anywhere without the rose that he believes changed his luck. Thats when this story starts to take off so great when the rose lady needs a lot of help and Jackie and his girlfriend promise to help her out.

If you're just out for an action fix, you may want to pick up another Chan movie instead. Although the fight scenes have quality work in choreography, execution, and creativity (beautiful fight in a rope-factory), it focuses on plot and dialogue for good chunks of time. If you don't mind a balanced movie between plot and action, you might want to jump on this one.Jackie Chan did a nice job in both directing and starring the movie. He played the naive poorboy with a heart of gold perfectly. The comedy in the movie didn't evoke the laughter Chan movie's usually get out of me, but it's still abit humorous nevertheless. It's a shame Anita Mui didn't get much development throughout the movie. Her love-relationship with Jackie in the movie seems strained, out of place, and unnecessary. I guess since there were so many things going on in the plot at once, their relationship was underdeveloped and took a back seat.Chan's directing throughout the movie is, in my opinion, his best effort as a director yet. He did a great job organizing the hectic mess of plotlines that consistently intervened and conflicted with each other, while ultimately leading it up to a climatic finish with the different plots being intertwined and combined.Note: I only viewed the movie through Cantonese dubbing w/English subtitles.

Unfortunately, i found Columbia-Tristar's DVD version to have a significantly degraded picture quality. Sometimes the images break up quite a bit, looking like a third generation dub of a vhs tape. Characters in long shots will often look as though they are on the COPS show as criminals with their faces electronically obscured. I wish C/star had gone to the trouble to get ahold of a real print of the film and had then handed it over to a digital transfer expert (in contrast,for example, much care was taken with the new Shanghai Noon DVD, and it has a spectacular look to it).

Jackie Chan is funny as a &quot;good&quot; gangster and, as always, amazes with his stunts. I particularly liked the fight scene in the restaurant and the chase in the streets. Anita Mui, who plays his lover, is not as funny as in movies like Drunken Master II, but is still adding a nice touch to the comedic aspect of the film.Unfortunately, the quality for the picture and the sound of the DVD isn't what we're accustomed from Columbia/Tri-Star. A few scratches from time to time destroy a little bit our pleasure. And I can't believe that this edition is offered in mono only. It should at least have been in dolby surround.A strange thing is that the subtitled version on the disc is 127 mins. long, but the dubbed one on the other side of the disc is 106 mins. long.

A lavish Hong Kong reworking of the Frank Capra-Damon Runyon classic Lady For a Day set in a lovingly recreated Twenties Hong Kong, you can see where the money's been spent, but too often the film feels like it's all window dressing. Director-star Chan is so enamoured of the project that he loses sight of the story and the audience and it constantly tips over into drawn-out self-indulgence even in the two hour version, so it's hard to imagine how slow Chan's original unreleased and reportedly lost three-hour cut must have been. Chan's a down-on-his-luck chancer who, after buying a lucky rose from an old woman, finds his luck changing, quickly working his way to the top as a gangster-cum-gambler-cum-club owner (of the kind who never kills anyone, naturally) and repays the favor by roping in his gang and various IOUs to masquerade as the cream of high society when the flower seller's daughter - who believes her mother to be a rich socialite - comes to visit. Action is thin on the ground until the elaborate ladder-fight finale, but that's less of a problem than the fact that neither the film nor the characters really engage your sympathy or much of your interest along the way. There are some good sequences, including a virtuoso single-take shot of making over a gambling den into a fancy restaurant with several nods to Buster Keaton along the way, but there just aren't enough of them.As others have noted, this DVD includes the 127-minute subtitled version that was released in Hong Kong theaters.",2,Less than miraculous,1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,1612,"['1987', 'Miracles', 'was', 'one', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'biggest', 'flops', 'not', 'difficult', 'see', 'why', 'lavish', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'reworking', 'Frank', 'Capra-Damon', 'Runyon', 'classic', 'Lady', 'Day', 'set', 'lovingly', 'recreated', 'Twenties', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'money', 'been', 'spent', 'too', 'often', 'film', 'feels', 'window', 'dressing', 'Director-star', 'Chan', 'so', 'enamoured', 'project', 'sight', 'story', 'audience', 'constantly', 'over', 'drawn-out', 'self-indulgence', 'even', 'two', 'hour', 'version', 'hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'slow', 'Chan', 'original', 'unreleased', 'reportedly', 'lost', 'three-hour', 'cut', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'Chan', 'down-on-his-luck', 'chancer', 'who', 'buying', 'lucky', 'rose', 'old', 'woman', 'luck', 'changing', 'quickly', 'working', 'way', 'top', 'gangster-cum-gambler-cum-club', 'owner', 'kind', 'who', 'never', 'anyone', 'naturally', 'favor', 'roping', 'gang', 'various', 'IOUs', 'masquerade', 'cream', 'high', 'society', 'when', 'flower', 'seller', 'daughter', 'who', 'mother', 'be', 'rich', 'socialite', 'visit', 'Action', 'thin', 'ground', 'elaborate', 'ladder-fight', 'finale', 'less', 'problem', 'fact', 'film', 'characters', 'really', 'engage', 'sympathy', 'much', 'interest', 'way', 'are', 'good', 'sequences', 'including', 'virtuoso', 'single-take', 'shot', 'making', 'over', 'gambling', 'den', 'fancy', 'restaurant', 'several', 'nods', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'way', 'there', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'them.As', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'DVD', '127-minute', 'subtitled', 'version', 'was', 'released', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'theaters']",N/A
