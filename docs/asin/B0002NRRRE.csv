The show was filmed live, so you have to make some allowances, but there aren't too many defects in the image and the digital conversion doesn't seem to have introduced any new problems.The original commercials are intact.  The show was filmed around the commercials, so cutting them out is not very smooth, although some of the DVD versions have apparently done so.Almost forty episodes for just under $9 seems like a pretty good deal.

Tales actually owes much of it's style to the Tales of Tomorrow radio show than anything else. That is how the show originally got it's start, and for a while after it's introduction to television, the radio show still existed alongside it.Production values were questionable at best, and much of the series feels claustrophobically trapped in tiny, poorly accoutoured soundstage sets that wouldn't fool a sci fi fan even in it's original airtime. Acting was often typical of the day, with emphasis on OVER-acting permeating much of the show's episodes.Writing was often repititious and stories thin and in need of filler.Still, if you want to see how it all started for sci fi television and have a penchant for nostalgia, you should definitely watch this vision of the future.

841556,A1VHBWB4FVDLX5,B0002NRRRE,"J. A. Hazelwood ""TheSynapZe""","[98, 101]","Not long ago, I had only heard about the television show Tales of Tomorrow just twice: once as a passing reference as an inspiration of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone in his PBS documentary, and once more when I saw the episode ""All the Time in the World"" at the Museum of TV and Radio in NYC when I visited there last August.  I had always liked TZ and I was happy to see one of it's predecessors which had left the air before my parents were even born.  I was not disappointed as the episode was another example of intelligently wielded suspense and science fiction, the kind of show that they just don't make any more (well UPN tried, but let's not talk about that right now).  There were other available episodes, but my family and I had to leave the museum, but imagine my happiness when I heard that a DVD boxset of Tales was coming.Tales of Tomorrow: Collection One is a series of selected episodes from the first season of televisions first sci-fi anthology series (including the one I previously mentioned); many of us are used to full season sets but after all, some episodes may no longer be accounted for.  There are no extras at all except for scene selection, though somehow I doubt there could be things like deleted scenes or creator commentaries (since many of the creators are probably no longer with us).I'm giving this collection 5 stars not because these episodes are timeless classics but because they are a rare and fascinating window into television's early history.  The shows feature commercials recorded on the same film as the show, and it's also apparent that TV producers at the time weren't big advocates for reshoots as they could be called today.  Actors badly flub their lines in many shows but keep on going.  Lon Chaney gives a well-known and confusing scene as Frankenstein where he hefts a chair in rage, calmly puts it down, then pantomimes smashing it.  My favorite is from the ""Miraculous Serum"" where a doctor listens for a dying woman's breathing without putting the stethoscope in his ears first.  Ha!But these stories don't deserve to be laughed at.  Seeing these shows made so long ago with such clarity is one of the greater gifts of the DVD revolution and I would recommend ""Tales of Tomorrow"" to anyone who loves television in general.  I'd love to see another installment, perhaps with a documentary.  Who knows what tomorrow will bring?",5,See Yesterday's Tales of Tomorrow ...

841560,A5UGX57EV695M,B0002NRRRE,Kenneth M. Pizzi,"[38, 38]","Tales of Tomorrow is really the forerunner of so many popular science fiction programs that dominated sci fi's ""golden age"" during the late 50's thru the 60's.  The ideas for series like ""One Step Beyond,"" ""Twilight Zone,"" and ""Outer Limits"" can trace their ideological and creative roots back to this series.  For example, one episode, ""What You Need"" was also picked up by Rod Serling as a story idea. Even John Newland, host of ""One Step Beyond,"" plays a protagonist in one of the less memorable and weaker episodes.While it is easy to be put off by the flubs in dialogue or the flimsy and cheap sets, the series is fun to watch while the story ideas remain different, imaginative, and creative.  The episodes have been restored and remastered as best as possible by Wade Williams Productions.  Wade Williams and his production team was responsible for restoring such greats as ""Rocketship XM"" and ""Destination Moon"" back in the mid-80's, often finding and restoring lost (in some cases replicating long shots with extras) or damaged footage from the original print.The episodes here are restored with their original commercials for Kreisler watch bands in their appropriate commerical breaks, and watching the epsidoes in their original and intended format is a fascinating glimpse into television history.",4,Most interesting artifact from television's early days....,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",2006,1310,"['Tales', 'Tomorrow', 'really', 'forerunner', 'so', 'many', 'popular', 'science', 'fiction', 'programs', 'dominated', 'sci', 'fi', 'golden', 'age', 'late', '50', 'thru', '60', 'ideas', 'series', 'One', 'Step', 'Beyond', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'can', 'trace', 'ideological', 'creative', 'roots', 'back', 'series', 'example', 'one', 'episode', 'What', 'Need', 'was', 'also', 'picked', 'up', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'story', 'idea', 'Even', 'John', 'Newland', 'host', 'One', 'Step', 'Beyond', 'protagonist', 'one', 'less', 'memorable', 'weaker', 'episodes.While', 'easy', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'flubs', 'dialogue', 'flimsy', 'cheap', 'sets', 'series', 'fun', 'watch', 'story', 'ideas', 'remain', 'different', 'imaginative', 'creative', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'restored', 'remastered', 'as', 'best', 'possible', 'Wade', 'Williams', 'Productions', 'Wade', 'Williams', 'production', 'team', 'was', 'responsible', 'restoring', 'such', 'greats', 'Rocketship', 'XM', 'Destination', 'Moon', 'back', 'mid-80', 'often', 'finding', 'restoring', 'lost', 'cases', 'replicating', 'long', 'shots', 'extras', 'damaged', 'footage', 'original', 'print.The', 'episodes', 'here', 'are', 'restored', 'original', 'commercials', 'Kreisler', 'watch', 'bands', 'appropriate', 'commerical', 'breaks', 'watching', 'epsidoes', 'original', 'intended', 'format', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'television', 'history']",N/A

The booklet included also offers good information about casts, first broadcast dates and chapters in the programs.  For those not familiar with early television, these programs were performed live on staged sets and recorded for later broadcast on the west coast.  Actors do indeed flub lines, camera focus is not always steady etc. because they just kept going rather than stop and reshoot as they would have done on film.  This is considered to be the first actual sci-fi series.  I have to say the scripts are not up the the standards of later shows like Twilight Zone and Outer Limits.  Some of the performances are uneven as well, but it's fun to see future stars like Paul Newman in their early days.  The commercials from the original broadcasts are included and are interesting in showing how things have changed.  Some episodes were sponsored by a carpet company, which also made fishing vests.  Watching the man demonstrate the vests is  a lot of fun.  Most episodes were sponsored by a watchband company featuring things like a watchband called the ""Monte Cristo"", which came in plastic dueling pistol case! They  also feature the Kreisler Kids,  a singing duo with a jingle that is so funny it sounds like a Saturday Night Live parody of early commercials. I warn you it is also one of those tunes that gets caught in your mind for days!  The disc set is very inexpensive, and a lot of fun,  if you are a fan of any of the actors in particular or just old tv shows in general.",4,early tv and early advertising,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",2013,1564,"['other', 'reviews', 'say', 'good', 'things', 'quality', 'discs', 'so', 'booklet', 'included', 'also', 'good', 'information', 'casts', 'first', 'broadcast', 'dates', 'chapters', 'programs', 'not', 'familiar', 'early', 'television', 'programs', 'were', 'performed', 'live', 'staged', 'sets', 'recorded', 'later', 'broadcast', 'west', 'coast', 'Actors', 'do', 'indeed', 'flub', 'lines', 'camera', 'focus', 'not', 'always', 'steady', 'etc', 'just', 'kept', 'going', 'rather', 'stop', 'reshoot', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'film', 'considered', 'be', 'first', 'actual', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'have', 'say', 'scripts', 'are', 'not', 'standards', 'later', 'shows', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'performances', 'are', 'uneven', 'well', 'fun', 'see', 'future', 'stars', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'early', 'days', 'commercials', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'interesting', 'showing', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'episodes', 'were', 'sponsored', 'carpet', 'company', 'also', 'made', 'fishing', 'vests', 'Watching', 'man', 'demonstrate', 'vests', 'lot', 'fun', 'Most', 'episodes', 'were', 'sponsored', 'watchband', 'company', 'featuring', 'things', 'watchband', 'called', 'Monte', 'Cristo', 'came', 'plastic', 'dueling', 'pistol', 'case', 'also', 'feature', 'Kreisler', 'Kids', 'singing', 'duo', 'jingle', 'so', 'funny', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'parody', 'early', 'commercials', 'warn', 'also', 'one', 'tunes', 'caught', 'mind', 'days', 'disc', 'set', 'very', 'inexpensive', 'lot', 'fun', 'are', 'fan', 'actors', 'particular', 'just', 'old', 'tv', 'shows', 'general']",N/A
