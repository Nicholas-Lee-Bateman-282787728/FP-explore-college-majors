It could be the age factor that she was really young on thi particular soap.  I was not engaged at all on this soap.  This is one of the boring soap that I have and would not watch again.  It will be on my book stand for ever.,2,Dulce and Boring!!!,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,355,"['Goddness', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'be', 'was', 'extremely', 'boring', 'like', 'adela', 'noriega', 'was', 'so', 'not', 'soap', 'could', 'be', 'age', 'factor', 'was', 'really', 'young', 'thi', 'particular', 'soap', 'was', 'not', 'engaged', 'soap', 'one', 'boring', 'soap', 'have', 'would', 'not', 'watch', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'book', 'stand', 'ever']",Dulce Desafio

It did have 3 CDs but I didn't think the plot of the novela had substance and didn't think it flowed well.

1057034,A3E8VO5PI4EB2X,B000NIVNC8,Rob Ez,"[11, 11]","I just finished watching this telenovela, abridged to 12 hours on 3 double sided discs. While on other telenovelas released one can really feel the editing, this one however really felt as if the whole story was present!I don't know if this telenovela was on for a short period of time or there were simply lots of filler scenes that allowed themselves to be easily removed, but the whole telenovela moves seamlessly and you really see their hatred, friendship and subsequent love affair really blossom. It just doesn't happen in an instant.Originally aired in 1988 in Mexico, this telenovela was criticized for glorifying teacher-student love affairs. Whilst I do agree, it serves for an entertaining and trashy soap. Though not my favourite of the DVD-telenovela bunch, ""Dulce Desafio"" was entertaining enough and certainly felt more complete than alot of the others released.",5,12 hours really felt complete this time!!,1179878400,"05 23, 2007",2007,878,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'telenovela', 'abridged', '12', 'hours', '3', 'double', 'sided', 'discs', 'other', 'telenovelas', 'released', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'editing', 'one', 'however', 'really', 'felt', 'whole', 'story', 'was', 'present', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'telenovela', 'was', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'were', 'simply', 'lots', 'filler', 'scenes', 'allowed', 'be', 'easily', 'removed', 'whole', 'telenovela', 'moves', 'seamlessly', 'really', 'see', 'hatred', 'friendship', 'subsequent', 'love', 'affair', 'really', 'blossom', 'just', ""n't"", 'happen', 'instant.Originally', 'aired', '1988', 'Mexico', 'telenovela', 'was', 'criticized', 'glorifying', 'teacher-student', 'love', 'affairs', 'Whilst', 'do', 'agree', 'entertaining', 'trashy', 'soap', 'not', 'favourite', 'DVD-telenovela', 'bunch', 'Dulce', 'Desafio', 'was', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'certainly', 'felt', 'more', 'complete', 'alot', 'others', 'released']",Dulce Desafio
