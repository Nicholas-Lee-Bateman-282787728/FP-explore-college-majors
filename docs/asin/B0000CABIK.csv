I'll say one thing, they definitely need to be making more positive movies like this one for our little boys (and girls!). My little guy just sat there glued to the screen when he watched this. He just loves Billy Blazes and the earthquake, wow! He just loved that and seeing all the rescue sequences that followed. What a positive influence this movie is - action packed but with positive action instead of negative. I hope there are more to come!  It's also nice for them to see what real-life rescue workers really do.  Although this is fictionalized, it does give a good example and ""feel"" for what are rescue folks may face in a given situation.

774917,A1GALZCXD8FHOR,B0000CABIK,Daniel L Edelen,"[37, 41]","""Rescue Heroes: The Movie"" is a boon to parents looking for positive entertainment for young children. If there is a better way to capture the attention of a four year old boy for an hour and a quarter, I can't think of what it is. My son repeatedly asked to watch this movie, spurning just about every other kid-oriented DVD out there.The formal Amazon.com review by Tom Keogh (above) says everything you need to know about the simple plot, so I won't go into detail here. The key differentiator between the movie and episodes of the TV series (by Canadian animators Nelvana) is the movie's reliance on CGI animation. That said, the CGI here is spotty. Some of it looks ""Tron""-era while other bits sparkle. The DVD itself is as basic as it gets, consisting of the movie, two episodes of the TV cartoon series, some still-frame background info on the characters (you'll have to read it to your kids yourself--the print is minuscule and hard to follow for the target age group), and a commercial for Mission Select versions of the Rescue Heroes toys, of course.Yes, this movie is nothing more than a slick marketing campaign featuring the latest redesign of the figurines. How much that troubles you is your decision. My son enjoys a limited amount of the toys, and the idea of him asking me for the newer Mission Select Team is to be expected having digested the advertising that is the movie. Fisher-Price was truly calculating on this one.Appropriate movies for the under-6 set are hard to come by, so having one geared to that group is nice. This movie is obviously not in the league of ""Citizen Kane"" and it's a giant ad dressed up as entertainment. Still, the characters display decent values (teamwork, safety, caring for others, courage, and such) and are based on real professions that are heroic in nature, good role models all. The action in the movie is a tad high on the peril factor, so some younger children may find it too intense. On first viewing, my son was a little worked up during the most threatening action scenes, but repeat viewings were not an issue. In fact, he asked for this DVD again and again.""Rescue Heroes: The Movie"" won't win awards from children's educators, but considering the rest of the junk out there aimed at young children, it's better than most.",3,"An ad for the toys, but still fun and with decent values",1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,2289,"['Rescue', 'Heroes', 'Movie', 'boon', 'parents', 'looking', 'positive', 'entertainment', 'young', 'children', 'better', 'way', 'capture', 'attention', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'hour', 'quarter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'what', 'son', 'repeatedly', 'asked', 'watch', 'movie', 'spurning', 'just', 'about', 'other', 'kid-oriented', 'DVD', 'out', 'there.The', 'formal', 'Amazon.com', 'review', 'Tom', 'Keogh', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'simple', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'here', 'key', 'differentiator', 'movie', 'episodes', 'TV', 'series', 'Canadian', 'animators', 'Nelvana', 'movie', 'reliance', 'CGI', 'animation', 'said', 'CGI', 'here', 'spotty', 'Tron', '-era', 'other', 'bits', 'sparkle', 'DVD', 'as', 'basic', 'consisting', 'movie', 'two', 'episodes', 'TV', 'cartoon', 'series', 'still-frame', 'background', 'info', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'have', 'read', 'kids', 'print', 'minuscule', 'hard', 'follow', 'target', 'age', 'group', 'commercial', 'Mission', 'Select', 'versions', 'Rescue', 'Heroes', 'course.Yes', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'slick', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'featuring', 'latest', 'redesign', 'figurines', 'How', 'much', 'troubles', 'decision', 'son', 'limited', 'amount', 'toys', 'idea', 'asking', 'newer', 'Mission', 'Select', 'Team', 'be', 'expected', 'having', 'digested', 'advertising', 'movie', 'Fisher-Price', 'was', 'truly', 'calculating', 'one.Appropriate', 'movies', 'under-6', 'set', 'are', 'hard', 'come', 'so', 'having', 'one', 'geared', 'group', 'nice', 'movie', 'obviously', 'not', 'league', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'giant', 'ad', 'dressed', 'up', 'entertainment', 'Still', 'characters', 'display', 'decent', 'values', 'teamwork', 'safety', 'caring', 'others', 'courage', 'such', 'are', 'based', 'real', 'professions', 'are', 'heroic', 'nature', 'good', 'role', 'models', 'action', 'movie', 'tad', 'high', 'peril', 'factor', 'so', 'younger', 'children', 'may', 'find', 'too', 'intense', 'first', 'viewing', 'son', 'was', 'little', 'worked', 'up', 'most', 'threatening', 'action', 'scenes', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'were', 'not', 'issue', 'fact', 'asked', 'DVD', 'again', 'again', 'Rescue', 'Heroes', 'Movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'children', 'educators', 'considering', 'rest', 'junk', 'there', 'aimed', 'young', 'children', 'better', 'most']",Rescue Heroes - The Movie VHS

774919,A2HBRINA3F9YHV,B0000CABIK,Doctor Trance,"[15, 15]","You get one full length movie, done in excellent looking computer animation, and two animated shorts from the standard cel animation tv show.  I am usually not in favor of some of these modern, CGI looking movies, but this one doesn't stray very much from the characters normal likenesses and looks good.  The two bonus tv shorts are from the 2nd batch of Rescue Heroes animation, which featured better animation than the 1st.  You will notice a big difference in how some of the characters were drawn, especially Rocky Canyon.  He had a very fat face and looked bulky in the 1st batch, but his face got much more realistic looking in the 2nd batch, and he looks leaner.  They definitely found better animators for the 2nd series, and it shows in the character's faces.All the videos and DVD's that come free with the toys are usually the 1st batch of shows, which is why this set is nice to have the newer ones, even though there are only 2.  If you are looking for the rest of the shows on DVD, you can get an order form with most of the figures, advertising 4 volumes of Rescue Heroes animated shows.  Volumes 1 & 2 feature the older shows (2001) and Volumes 3 & 4 feature the 2003, updated animation ones.  They are not for sale on Amazon and can only be ordered through Fisher Price (which takes much shorter than their listed 6 weeks time), or through online auction.If your child is a fan of the toys or the show, they should love this movie, which features tons of action right from the start.  The movie also features some secondary characters such as Rip Rockefeller and Pat Pending.  The main characters of Jake Justice, Billy Blazes, Wendy Waters, Ariel Flyer, Jack Hammer, and Rocky Canyon are all here, with Rocky getting a lot of screen time, as the movie focuses on his eagerness to be a RH team leader.A must have for any Rescue Heroes fan.  This DVD is VERY hard to find in most local stores, so I would just order right here through Amazon.",5,A must have for Rescue Heroes fans.,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,1959,"['get', 'one', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'done', 'excellent', 'looking', 'computer', 'animation', 'two', 'animated', 'shorts', 'standard', 'cel', 'animation', 'tv', 'show', 'am', 'usually', 'not', 'favor', 'modern', 'CGI', 'looking', 'movies', 'one', ""n't"", 'stray', 'very', 'much', 'characters', 'normal', 'likenesses', 'good', 'two', 'bonus', 'tv', 'shorts', 'are', '2nd', 'batch', 'Rescue', 'Heroes', 'animation', 'featured', 'better', 'animation', '1st', 'will', 'notice', 'big', 'difference', 'how', 'characters', 'were', 'drawn', 'especially', 'Rocky', 'Canyon', 'had', 'very', 'fat', 'face', 'looked', 'bulky', '1st', 'batch', 'face', 'got', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'looking', '2nd', 'batch', 'leaner', 'definitely', 'found', 'better', 'animators', '2nd', 'series', 'character', 'videos', 'DVD', 'come', 'free', 'toys', 'are', 'usually', '1st', 'batch', 'shows', 'why', 'set', 'nice', 'have', 'newer', 'ones', 'even', 'are', 'only', '2', 'are', 'looking', 'rest', 'shows', 'DVD', 'can', 'get', 'order', 'form', 'most', 'figures', 'advertising', '4', 'volumes', 'Rescue', 'Heroes', 'animated', 'shows', 'Volumes', '1', '2', 'feature', 'older', 'shows', '2001', 'Volumes', '3', '4', 'feature', '2003', 'updated', 'animation', 'ones', 'are', 'not', 'sale', 'Amazon', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'ordered', 'Fisher', 'Price', 'much', 'shorter', 'listed', '6', 'weeks', 'time', 'online', 'child', 'fan', 'toys', 'show', 'should', 'love', 'movie', 'tons', 'action', 'right', 'start', 'movie', 'also', 'secondary', 'characters', 'such', 'Rip', 'Rockefeller', 'Pat', 'Pending', 'main', 'characters', 'Jake', 'Justice', 'Billy', 'Blazes', 'Wendy', 'Waters', 'Ariel', 'Flyer', 'Jack', 'Hammer', 'Rocky', 'Canyon', 'are', 'here', 'Rocky', 'getting', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'movie', 'eagerness', 'be', 'RH', 'team', 'leader.A', 'must', 'have', 'Rescue', 'Heroes', 'fan', 'DVD', 'VERY', 'hard', 'find', 'most', 'local', 'stores', 'would', 'just', 'order', 'right', 'here', 'Amazon']",Rescue Heroes - The Movie VHS
