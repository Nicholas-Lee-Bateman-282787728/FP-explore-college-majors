But it's still a well-done movie, and I enjoyed it.Eddie Hodges plays Huck, and I'm sure I've seen him elsewhere, but I admit I don't remember where. Archie Moore, who was a champion boxer before he took up acting, plays Jim, and shows he's quite a good actor. It would be interesting to know what other films he's done. Neville Brand plays Pap, as mean as he can be.Tony Randall plays the smooth-talking con man who calls himself the lost King of France, and Mickey Shaughnessy is the Duke. Patty McCormack (remember her? I think she played Pollyanna.) is the younger sister who does not believe the King and the Duke and Huck are their long-lost relatives from England. Sterling Holloway is the town barber who first announces the arrival of the English relatives when the three frauds show up, and then again when the real English relatives show up. Andy Devine plays the circus manager who takes in, and is taken in, by Huck and Jim, to keep Jim away from the slave-catchers. Buster Keaton plays the long-suffering lion-tamer.The incidents in the movie are enough like the book that I wouldn't want to tell the story over again. But you can tell with all those excellent talents listed above -- and more -- that it's a well-made movie version of a great story.",4,One of the Better Versions of this Much-Filmed Favorite,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,1368,"['Well', 'movie', 'made', 'book', 'had', 'leave', 'lot', 'had', 'change', 'things', 'still', 'well-done', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'it.Eddie', 'Hodges', 'Huck', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'elsewhere', 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'where', 'Archie', 'Moore', 'who', 'was', 'champion', 'boxer', 'took', 'up', 'acting', 'Jim', 'quite', 'good', 'actor', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'know', 'what', 'other', 'films', 'done', 'Neville', 'Brand', 'Pap', 'as', 'mean', 'can', 'be.Tony', 'Randall', 'smooth-talking', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'King', 'France', 'Mickey', 'Shaughnessy', 'Duke', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'remember', 'think', 'played', 'Pollyanna', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'not', 'believe', 'King', 'Duke', 'Huck', 'are', 'long-lost', 'relatives', 'England', 'Sterling', 'Holloway', 'town', 'barber', 'who', 'first', 'arrival', 'English', 'relatives', 'when', 'three', 'frauds', 'show', 'up', 'then', 'again', 'when', 'real', 'English', 'relatives', 'show', 'up', 'Andy', 'Devine', 'circus', 'manager', 'who', 'taken', 'Huck', 'Jim', 'keep', 'Jim', 'away', 'slave-catchers', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'long-suffering', 'lion-tamer.The', 'incidents', 'movie', 'are', 'enough', 'book', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'tell', 'story', 'again', 'can', 'tell', 'excellent', 'talents', 'listed', 'above', 'more', 'well-made', 'movie', 'version', 'great', 'story']",N/A
