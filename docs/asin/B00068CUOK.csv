862927,A3STFVPM8NHJ7B,B00068CUOK,A. Pierre,"[2, 3]","Ive watched Unsolved Mysteries ever since I was little, and I was excited to see sets come out for the series. I got this set for cheap, but just like Ghosts-it lacks some great stories. Ghost might be a better buy, but this is still a good set. Unsolved Mysteries was on for over 10 years I belive, so if the sets were entitled Bizarre Murders Volume 1 or Ghosts Volume 1, id be happy. So many more better and chilling stories are left out, which you can probably find on reruns somewhere. This set is worth the money, but I fondly remember so much better cases then the ones presented. I think Whistle Blown is probably the best story on here.",3,Yes its good but...,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,645,"['Ive', 'watched', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'ever', 'was', 'little', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'sets', 'come', 'out', 'series', 'got', 'set', 'cheap', 'just', 'Ghosts-it', 'great', 'stories', 'Ghost', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'buy', 'still', 'good', 'set', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'was', '10', 'years', 'belive', 'so', 'sets', 'were', 'entitled', 'Bizarre', 'Murders', 'Volume', '1', 'Ghosts', 'Volume', '1', 'id', 'be', 'happy', 'So', 'many', 'more', 'better', 'chilling', 'stories', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'can', 'probably', 'find', 'reruns', 'somewhere', 'set', 'money', 'fondly', 'remember', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'cases', 'then', 'ones', 'presented', 'think', 'Whistle', 'Blown', 'probably', 'best', 'story', 'here']",N/A
862928,A1C9E7RJQ0R0NV,B00068CUOK,"dargxj ""dargxj""","[10, 10]","I have this set, as well as the ghosts and UFOs sets, which are also worth picking up. I will say that I have been a longtime viewer of this show, ever since the early 90's. I feel that putting this show on DVD is a most excellent choise, and allows veteran viewers like myself to re-watch their favorite segmants without having to wait for reruns on Lifetime(currently reruns are shown back to back 5 day a week). It also gives newcomers a chance to see what they were missing back when these episodes were new, and they can take their time catching up on the series.Anyway, the episodes have already been listed so I will only give details on the ones that I feel stick out the most. You may remember some of these cases from when they originally aired over a decade ago....Trailer Terror-A couple is shot dead and their home torched. The couple's daughter and her friend were home at the time but their bodies were never found. No one knows if they were abducted, ran away, or themselves committed the crime.Journalist's Murder-An investigative reporter is found dead in a hotel bathtub. At the time he was investigating ties between organized crime and government personnel. Many use his fear of blood to refute the police ruling of suicide.Scared To Death-A chilling story of a nurse who supposedly experienced seven years of inescapable stalkings before she was found dead, tied up, and drugged. Some say she staged the who ordeal and in the end killed herself, but other disagree.Unicorn's Secret-Case of the hippy guru and woman-abuser Ira Einhorn, who killed his girlfriend and kept her body in a Closet for a year and a half. Upon the discovery of the body, he convinced people it was a government set-up and was released, than spent 16 in Europe until his 2001 extradition from France. He was later sentenced to life.Backyard Bones-Police recievce a tip that a man killed his wife and buried her in their backyard. When police excavate there, they find hers, and several other peoples', chopped into small fragments and scattered about under the dirt.Mistake Hit-A reporter writes stories on local mob figures and later gets death threats, but his neighbor across the street, who has a similar-looking home and car, winds up dead. It could have been a mistake, or a warning to the reporter to back off. References to the case in the Journalist's murder segment show up in this episode.Friends To The End-To teens were found dead on the railroad tracks, but evidence later showed that they were killed elsewhere. Motives for the killings revolved alot around drug deals, which were common in that area.Whistle Blown-A man who fits pipes at a uranium processing factory dissappears, and his remains are later found charred in the plant's furnace. Many say that his death was the result of his knowing too much about safety violations and illegal dumping of toxic waste that the plant was involved with.Two Mary Murders-Two women with the same first and last name who live in the same area are killed within days of each other. Motives are not known and the best idea is that the first hit was a mistake that was later corrected with the second hit.Of course there is more to this set than described above, but if you want the whole nine yards you will have to buy this. There are some cases that should have been here but were not included on this set(as there are cases that could have been on the other box sets and were not). Maybe they will release another volume of this catagory, and maybe even put out a set on their missing persons stories as well. But for now I will be content with my three 4-disc sets of a show that ended on a sad note with the sudden death of its host. If you never saw the show but love true crime stories, you should purchase this ASAP. If you liked the show that you most likely have it already.",5,Excellent subject from a timeless show,1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,3837,"['have', 'set', 'as', 'well', 'ghosts', 'UFOs', 'sets', 'are', 'also', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'will', 'say', 'have', 'been', 'longtime', 'viewer', 'show', 'ever', 'early', '90', 'feel', 'putting', 'show', 'DVD', 'most', 'excellent', 'choise', 'veteran', 'viewers', 're-watch', 'favorite', 'segmants', 'having', 'wait', 'reruns', 'Lifetime', 'currently', 'reruns', 'are', 'shown', 'back', 'back', '5', 'day', 'week', 'also', 'newcomers', 'chance', 'see', 'what', 'were', 'missing', 'back', 'when', 'episodes', 'were', 'new', 'can', 'take', 'time', 'catching', 'up', 'series.Anyway', 'episodes', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'listed', 'so', 'will', 'only', 'give', 'details', 'ones', 'feel', 'stick', 'out', 'most', 'may', 'remember', 'cases', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'decade', 'ago', 'Terror-A', 'couple', 'shot', 'dead', 'home', 'torched', 'couple', 'daughter', 'friend', 'were', 'home', 'time', 'bodies', 'were', 'never', 'found', 'one', 'were', 'abducted', 'ran', 'away', 'committed', 'crime.Journalist', 'Murder-An', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'found', 'dead', 'hotel', 'bathtub', 'time', 'was', 'investigating', 'ties', 'organized', 'crime', 'government', 'personnel', 'Many', 'fear', 'blood', 'refute', 'police', 'ruling', 'suicide.Scared', 'Death-A', 'chilling', 'story', 'nurse', 'who', 'supposedly', 'experienced', 'seven', 'years', 'inescapable', 'stalkings', 'was', 'found', 'dead', 'tied', 'up', 'drugged', 'say', 'staged', 'who', 'ordeal', 'end', 'killed', 'other', 'disagree.Unicorn', 'Secret-Case', 'hippy', 'guru', 'woman-abuser', 'Ira', 'Einhorn', 'who', 'killed', 'girlfriend', 'kept', 'body', 'Closet', 'year', 'half', 'discovery', 'body', 'convinced', 'people', 'was', 'government', 'set-up', 'was', 'released', 'spent', '16', 'Europe', '2001', 'extradition', 'France', 'was', 'later', 'sentenced', 'life.Backyard', 'Bones-Police', 'recievce', 'tip', 'man', 'killed', 'wife', 'buried', 'backyard', 'When', 'police', 'excavate', 'there', 'find', 'hers', 'several', 'other', 'peoples', 'chopped', 'small', 'fragments', 'scattered', 'dirt.Mistake', 'Hit-A', 'reporter', 'stories', 'local', 'mob', 'figures', 'later', 'death', 'threats', 'neighbor', 'street', 'who', 'similar-looking', 'home', 'car', 'up', 'dead', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'mistake', 'warning', 'reporter', 'back', 'off', 'References', 'case', 'Journalist', 'murder', 'segment', 'show', 'up', 'End-To', 'teens', 'were', 'found', 'dead', 'railroad', 'tracks', 'evidence', 'later', 'showed', 'were', 'killed', 'elsewhere', 'Motives', 'killings', 'revolved', 'alot', 'drug', 'deals', 'were', 'common', 'area.Whistle', 'Blown-A', 'man', 'who', 'pipes', 'uranium', 'processing', 'factory', 'dissappears', 'remains', 'are', 'later', 'found', 'charred', 'plant', 'furnace', 'Many', 'say', 'death', 'was', 'result', 'knowing', 'too', 'much', 'safety', 'violations', 'illegal', 'dumping', 'toxic', 'waste', 'plant', 'was', 'involved', 'with.Two', 'Mary', 'Murders-Two', 'women', 'same', 'first', 'last', 'name', 'who', 'live', 'same', 'area', 'are', 'killed', 'days', 'other', 'Motives', 'are', 'not', 'known', 'best', 'idea', 'first', 'hit', 'was', 'mistake', 'was', 'later', 'corrected', 'second', 'hit.Of', 'course', 'more', 'set', 'described', 'want', 'whole', 'nine', 'yards', 'will', 'have', 'buy', 'are', 'cases', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'here', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'set', 'are', 'cases', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'box', 'sets', 'were', 'not', 'Maybe', 'will', 'release', 'volume', 'catagory', 'maybe', 'even', 'put', 'out', 'set', 'missing', 'persons', 'stories', 'as', 'well', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'content', 'three', '4-disc', 'sets', 'show', 'ended', 'sad', 'note', 'sudden', 'death', 'host', 'never', 'saw', 'show', 'love', 'true', 'crime', 'stories', 'should', 'purchase', 'ASAP', 'liked', 'show', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'already']",N/A

Part of the set deal with murders that were solved, but the other half are murders that are still unsolved to this day. This is what interested me the most, not just that they were unsolved but why.Of the top of my head, the ""Danny Casolara"", ""Prison Killings"", ""Plane Sabotage"", ""Dakota Double Murders"", and ""Civil Rights Murders"" were the most intriguing partially do the fact that Robert Stack and show made it obvious that these murders were part of a cover-up. Whether they are part of a cover-up made from the government, a crazy person, or sloppy police-work is open to debate. The Casolara case is entirely disturbing. A man allegedly slashes his wrists while working on a top secret journalist report and the cops are dumb enough to conclude it is suicide? Give me a break.The late Robert Stack is great in presenting these stories adding his own input into the story. The only bad thing about the set is that the Special Features are very limited. In this case, per DVD we get about two audio commentaries on select episodes but that's it.

A few segments such as ""Texas Most Wanted"", ""Margo Freshwater"" and ""Richard's Rampge"" don't qualify as ""Bizarre Murders"" because their about people who have gone on killing sprees and aren't bizarre.

862932,A3UIBKQBKF0PKV,B00068CUOK,"Jonathan Turbide ""The Investigator""","[0, 1]","I have a lot of documentary on DVD. From Cities of the Underworld to almost anything made by the history channel I have a lot of DVDs about History, True Crimes and the Paranormal. After all these years and countless Hours spent in front of the TV I think my Unsolved Mysteries DVDs are still my favorites.I bought this set 4 years ago and I still enjoy watching some of the stories featured on this set: The Zodiac/Unabomber Connection, the Murder of Danny Casolaro, ""Friends to the end"", ""Plane Crash Investigation"", ""Whistle Blown"", the Murder of Joyce Chiang, ""Mistake Hit"", ""Scared to death"", ""Dakota Double death"", ""Bad Chief"", The Disappearance of Ashley and Lauria....So there's a lot of very interesting stories there. However where is the segment about The Black Dahlia ?? Some of the segments are just awful (Margo Freshwater, Campus Calamity, The Heiress story) and I think the producers could have done a better job picking the stories for this set. In my opinion there is 14 really good, interesting stories and that's not a lot if you think about all the great Unsolved murders segments UM aired over the years. So it was a disappointment.As a huge fan of documentaries about True Crimes/Murder Mysteries I can't say that this set is a must have, I think a DVD Set like ""Crimes of the Century"" (available here on Amazon) is way better. But Unsolved Mysteries always have this special atmosphere, this special ""aura"", and just for that the set is really special. It's far from being perfect, but it's still a very good set if you enjoy watching documentaries about True Crimes/Real life Mysteries.",3,"Not a must have, but still pretty good.",1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,1611,"['have', 'lot', 'documentary', 'DVD', 'Cities', 'Underworld', 'almost', 'anything', 'made', 'history', 'channel', 'have', 'lot', 'DVDs', 'History', 'True', 'Crimes', 'Paranormal', 'years', 'countless', 'Hours', 'spent', 'front', 'TV', 'think', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'DVDs', 'are', 'still', 'favorites.I', 'bought', 'set', '4', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'stories', 'featured', 'set', 'Zodiac/Unabomber', 'Connection', 'Murder', 'Danny', 'Casolaro', 'Friends', 'end', 'Plane', 'Crash', 'Investigation', 'Whistle', 'Blown', 'Murder', 'Joyce', 'Chiang', 'Mistake', 'Hit', 'Scared', 'death', 'Dakota', 'Double', 'death', 'Bad', 'Chief', 'Disappearance', 'Ashley', 'Lauria', '.So', 'lot', 'very', 'interesting', 'stories', 'there', 'However', 'where', 'segment', 'Black', 'Dahlia', 'segments', 'are', 'just', 'awful', 'Margo', 'Freshwater', 'Campus', 'Calamity', 'Heiress', 'story', 'think', 'producers', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'picking', 'stories', 'set', 'opinion', '14', 'really', 'good', 'interesting', 'stories', 'not', 'lot', 'think', 'great', 'Unsolved', 'murders', 'segments', 'UM', 'aired', 'years', 'was', 'disappointment.As', 'huge', 'fan', 'documentaries', 'True', 'Crimes/Murder', 'Mysteries', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'set', 'must', 'have', 'think', 'DVD', 'Set', 'Crimes', 'Century', 'available', 'here', 'Amazon', 'way', 'better', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'always', 'have', 'special', 'atmosphere', 'special', 'aura', 'just', 'set', 'really', 'special', 'far', 'being', 'perfect', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'set', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'documentaries', 'True', 'Crimes/Real', 'life', 'Mysteries']",N/A

862935,A21P8800ZGRGIP,B00068CUOK,Miketheratguy,"[5, 5]","THE SHORT: Surprisingly interesting and sometimes freaky selection of segments from a show that I used to watch just for the more out-there stuff.THE LONG: I grew up watching this show for its UFO and ghost stuff, so when those two sets of dvds came out I picked them up right away and was pretty satisfied (less so with the ghost set). I've always been interested in murder stories and criminal psychology, but I just didn't check this set out right away. Getting it for a gift however, I was quite surprised. This isn't just a collection of ""America's Most Wanted"" style crime such as ""Two fugitives killed Bill Anderson as they ran from a bank heist"". Rather, it's as the title of this dvd set suggests: Bizarre murders.You'll learn about two boys, apparently alive, who were prone and motionless on the tracks as they were run over by a train. A factory worker who disappeared, only for records to show that the furnace temperature momentarily dipped 28 degrees ""as if something foreign had been dumped into it"". A man who heard strange noises outside his house and was found shot days later, with reason to suspect the friend who found him and even the sheriff who investigated. And a woman who received threatening letters, strange phone calls, assaults in the night, and was found bound and strangled- only for police to call it a suicide, with decent conjecture.Many of the stories on this more than 6 hour set are like this-murder cases that have a strange aspect that just doesn't add up, or have a somewhat unsettling ""campfire story"" vibe to them. And like all of the sets, they're perfectly as advertised: uncut segments, from their beginning to end, introduced and narrated by Robert Stack as if you put the moments on a collection dvd yourself right from the show. Each of the 4 discs is about an hour and a half long, come in a black slipsleeve, and have some moderate extras such as a few segment commentaries per disc. It's all flat-out interesting; if you like Unsolved Mysteries at all you'll like this well-done set. If anything, the only complaint is that even at 6 hours, it honestly seems to be over a lot faster. Quite worth the twenty bucks these sets usually go for.",5,Good set- some genuinely creepy and interesting stories.,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,2193,"['SHORT', 'Surprisingly', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'freaky', 'selection', 'segments', 'show', 'used', 'watch', 'just', 'more', 'out-there', 'stuff.THE', 'LONG', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'show', 'UFO', 'ghost', 'stuff', 'so', 'when', 'two', 'sets', 'dvds', 'came', 'out', 'picked', 'up', 'right', 'away', 'was', 'pretty', 'satisfied', 'less', 'so', 'ghost', 'set', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'murder', 'stories', 'criminal', 'psychology', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'check', 'set', 'out', 'right', 'away', 'Getting', 'gift', 'however', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', ""n't"", 'just', 'collection', 'America', 'Most', 'Wanted', 'style', 'crime', 'such', 'Two', 'fugitives', 'killed', 'Bill', 'Anderson', 'ran', 'bank', 'heist', 'Rather', 'title', 'dvd', 'set', 'suggests', 'Bizarre', 'murders.You', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'two', 'boys', 'apparently', 'alive', 'who', 'were', 'prone', 'motionless', 'tracks', 'were', 'run', 'over', 'train', 'factory', 'worker', 'who', 'disappeared', 'only', 'records', 'show', 'furnace', 'temperature', 'momentarily', 'dipped', '28', 'degrees', 'something', 'foreign', 'had', 'been', 'dumped', 'man', 'who', 'heard', 'strange', 'noises', 'house', 'was', 'found', 'shot', 'days', 'later', 'reason', 'suspect', 'friend', 'who', 'found', 'even', 'sheriff', 'who', 'investigated', 'woman', 'who', 'received', 'threatening', 'letters', 'strange', 'phone', 'calls', 'assaults', 'night', 'was', 'found', 'bound', 'strangled-', 'only', 'police', 'call', 'suicide', 'decent', 'conjecture.Many', 'stories', 'more', '6', 'hour', 'set', 'are', 'this-murder', 'cases', 'have', 'strange', 'aspect', 'just', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'have', 'somewhat', 'unsettling', 'campfire', 'story', 'vibe', 'sets', ""'re"", 'perfectly', 'advertised', 'uncut', 'segments', 'beginning', 'end', 'introduced', 'narrated', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'put', 'moments', 'collection', 'dvd', 'right', 'show', '4', 'discs', 'hour', 'half', 'long', 'come', 'black', 'slipsleeve', 'have', 'moderate', 'extras', 'such', 'few', 'segment', 'commentaries', 'disc', 'flat-out', 'interesting', 'like', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', ""'ll"", 'like', 'well-done', 'set', 'anything', 'only', 'complaint', 'even', '6', 'hours', 'honestly', 'be', 'lot', 'faster', 'Quite', 'twenty', 'sets', 'usually', 'go']",N/A

There are 32 murder mysteries in all with a running time of over 6 hours.  These aren't just mediocre cases either, but rather the very best that 'Unsolved Mysteries' had to offer from it's 13 seasons on television!  The mysteries profiled range from crooked Police Chiefs and dead college students to the Zodiac Killer and a downed Army plane that killed 248 soldiers.  There's even an appearance by a young Matthew McConaughey playing the murder victim Larry Dickens in the segment entitled 'Texas Most Wanted'.  Another great addition to this set are the updates which accompany some of the mysteries that have since been solved.
