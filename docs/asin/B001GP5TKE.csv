Kathy Smith is great.  She is encouraging and fun without seeming fake.  There is also chaptering so you can customize your workout.  It contains the best combination of movements and you can feel how effective it is without becoming frustrated.  I definitely recommend this one.",5,Kathy Smith does not disappoint.,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,420,"['Tracy', 'Andersen', 'DVDs', 'are', 'favorite', 'Callanetics/Lotte', 'Berke', 'method', 'inspired', 'videos', 'one', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'less', 'expensive', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'great', 'encouraging', 'fun', 'seeming', 'fake', 'also', 'chaptering', 'can', 'customize', 'workout', 'best', 'combination', 'movements', 'can', 'feel', 'how', 'effective', 'becoming', 'frustrated', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'one']",Kathy Smith: Total Body Lift

Her workouts are well thought out and well planned, and the most effective.I believe this video was more challenging than most of her other muscle toning videos because of the intricacy of the movements. The movements are very slight, but they are more intense and the angles are more awkward.Because the exercises are more unconventional than other videos, it provides a nice change. However, one must be careful about hurting themselves while doing this workout (i.e., knees). The individual workouts themselves are not long, but they are intense. They work your muscles in directions they don't normally go.",4,Advanced,1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,706,"['believe', ""'ve"", 'done', 'ninety', 'percent', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'videos', 'good', 'reason', 'workouts', 'are', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'well', 'planned', 'most', 'effective.I', 'believe', 'video', 'was', 'more', 'challenging', 'most', 'other', 'muscle', 'toning', 'videos', 'intricacy', 'movements', 'movements', 'are', 'very', 'slight', 'are', 'more', 'intense', 'angles', 'are', 'more', 'exercises', 'are', 'more', 'unconventional', 'other', 'videos', 'nice', 'change', 'However', 'must', 'be', 'careful', 'hurting', 'doing', 'workout', 'i.e.', 'knees', 'individual', 'are', 'not', 'long', 'are', 'intense', 'work', 'muscles', 'directions', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'go']",Kathy Smith: Total Body Lift

I have very little time to workout each day and after trying this workout yesterday and again today I feel I've wasted two exercise days.I enjoyed the warm-up to Total Body Lift and wish the rest of the workout could have followed the format of the warm-up (large flowing, stretching, toning moves), but it didn't. The first section (arms) had some great exercises and was the only section where I really felt any benefit, but it's short and there aren't a lot of repetitions. The legs and butt sections seemed like watered down versions of the Lift Weights to Lose Weight workouts (which are much more intense and effective than this one). I turned the abs section off midway through, as I just wasn't enjoying it and felt like I was wasting my time.I don't know if I was just doing all the moves wrong or what, but my heartrate was never at all elevated, I never felt much isometric resistance, and I didn't feel sore or ""worked-out"" after this DVD, just annoyed. I love Kathy's Matrix method DVD's, but will be returning this one.",2,Disappointed!,1267747200,"03 5, 2010",2010,1147,"['very', 'rare', 'finish', 'new', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'workout', 'feel', 'disappointed', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'fan', 'one', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'workout', 'day', 'trying', 'workout', 'yesterday', 'again', 'today', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'wasted', 'two', 'exercise', 'days.I', 'enjoyed', 'warm-up', 'Total', 'Body', 'Lift', 'wish', 'rest', 'workout', 'could', 'have', 'followed', 'format', 'warm-up', 'large', 'flowing', 'stretching', 'toning', 'moves', 'did', ""n't"", 'first', 'section', 'arms', 'had', 'great', 'exercises', 'was', 'only', 'section', 'where', 'really', 'felt', 'benefit', 'short', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'repetitions', 'legs', 'butt', 'sections', 'seemed', 'watered', 'down', 'versions', 'Lift', 'Weights', 'Lose', 'Weight', 'workouts', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'effective', 'one', 'turned', 'abs', 'section', 'midway', 'through', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enjoying', 'felt', 'was', 'wasting', 'time.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'just', 'doing', 'moves', 'wrong', 'what', 'heartrate', 'was', 'never', 'elevated', 'never', 'felt', 'much', 'isometric', 'resistance', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sore', 'worked-out', 'DVD', 'just', 'annoyed', 'love', 'Kathy', 'Matrix', 'method', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'returning', 'one']",Kathy Smith: Total Body Lift

This is a workout based on those dance/pilates/yoga moves with some barre work, here done with a chair. The arm section is particularly good. I like this workout, and the variations on standard ballet plies (with a towel between your knees, for instance)are an inovative change,especially if you've been doing ballet barre exercises for awhile, as I have.
