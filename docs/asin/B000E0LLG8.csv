964101,AZJE6RT4HBXSJ,B000E0LLG8,"C. Kirby ""drhuckyit""","[3, 4]","A very intense film that seems to have some Lynch ideas, but more akin to Hitchcock to real film fan.  Even some of the acting direction harkens back to the fifties, I'm reminded of Night of the Hunter during the scene with Frank and the shopgirl, the almost bad acting over the top performance.  I guess this got panned as a Lynch wannabe, but I guess I found it a lot more disturbing than Lynch's twisted sense of humor and irony.  And I love Lynch..",5,Dark Pulp Reality,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,452,"['very', 'intense', 'film', 'have', 'Lynch', 'ideas', 'more', 'akin', 'Hitchcock', 'real', 'film', 'fan', 'Even', 'acting', 'direction', 'back', 'fifties', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'Night', 'Hunter', 'scene', 'Frank', 'shopgirl', 'almost', 'bad', 'acting', 'top', 'performance', 'guess', 'got', 'panned', 'Lynch', 'wannabe', 'guess', 'found', 'lot', 'more', 'disturbing', 'Lynch', 'twisted', 'sense', 'humor', 'irony', 'love', 'Lynch..']",N/A

Then I noticed it on Amazon so I decided to buy it. I was told that it was a great cinema masterpiece that ranked along the lines of Blue Velvet. Again this is an independent film, and I try to support Independent movies because some of the best movies have been Independent films.Needless to say, I was disappointed. It is about a young man who is abused at home and sneaks off to town to go to a carnival. He becomes somewhat obsessed with Karen Black's character but she seems to be under some sort of spell by the owner of the carnival. There are some interesting filming techniques that you do not see in movies often, but other than that I did not quite get the story. I am not sure if the characters are ghost or trapped souls that move from place to place or what, but sadly I can not recommend spending any large amount of money on this movie. It's too long and hard to follow. Rent or buy at your own risk.",1,Not worth the wait to make it to DVD.,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,1033,"['had', 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'forgot', 'awhile', 'Then', 'noticed', 'Amazon', 'decided', 'buy', 'was', 'told', 'was', 'great', 'cinema', 'masterpiece', 'ranked', 'lines', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'Again', 'independent', 'film', 'try', 'support', 'Independent', 'movies', 'best', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'Independent', 'films.Needless', 'say', 'was', 'disappointed', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'abused', 'home', 'sneaks', 'off', 'town', 'go', 'carnival', 'somewhat', 'obsessed', 'Karen', 'Black', 'character', 'be', 'sort', 'spell', 'owner', 'carnival', 'are', 'interesting', 'filming', 'techniques', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'movies', 'often', 'other', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'get', 'story', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'characters', 'are', 'ghost', 'trapped', 'souls', 'move', 'place', 'place', 'what', 'sadly', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'spending', 'large', 'amount', 'money', 'movie', 'too', 'long', 'hard', 'follow', 'Rent', 'buy', 'own', 'risk']",N/A

I saw the display cover and looked at it and I noticed that Mike Patton was on of the actors.  So me being a huge Mike Patton fan(Faith No More,Mr. Bungle,Fantomas,Tomahawk,etc...) I had to rent this.  I'm glad to say that this film did not dissapoint and Patton gave an outstanding performance.  I cant really explain much of the plot.  Its one of those films that you just have to watch to understand.  Its about a string of weird events that actually happened in a small town in Kansas some years ago.  It does have some disturbing scenes, but dont most ""independent"" films.  This kept reminding me of a David Lynch movie the more I watched it.  Great direction, great acting, and a killer musical score.

964106,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000E0LLG8,Lee Armstrong,"[9, 13]","Steve Balderson's ""Firecracker"" could be better titled ""Sparkler.""  It doesn't exactly pop with excitement.  The themes are dark.  Male rape, especially by an older brother on a younger possibly mentally retarded boy, is a subject that needs sensitive handling.  Instead Faith No More's frontman Mike Patton is cast in the dual role of David who rapes & probably has a history of abuse with his brother Jimmy and as the circus sadist Frank who surgically scars his lead singer Sandra (Karen Black) so she will be unattractive to other men.  There really is no redeeming grace for either character, with Frank's fake goatee and strained sadism being less than convincing.  The movie really stars newcomer Jak Kendall whose naked behind is frequently in view.  As Jimmy, Kendall seems like a deeply disturbed lad; whether caused by mental retardation or severe stress of sexual abuse, it is hard to say.  Karen Black's Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination was way back in 1970 for ""Five Easy Pieces.""  She has worked consistently in many films, but has failed to hit with a role that propels her back before the public eye.  This film won't do it, although as the Bible-quoting mother Eleanor whose husband is failing and eventually must be put in a nursing home and as the exotic aging lounge singer Sandra that captures Jimmy's imagination, she does a good job.  Her red cape flying in the final scene is somewhere between M. Night Shamalyan and the Asian film ""Heroes"" in its visual brilliance.  Susan Traylor from ""A River Runs Through It"" & ""Finding Graceland"" plays the police chief Ed.  She adds intensity to an underwritten role.  Unfortunately, the perverse events never amount to much of a story, even with an act of violence as the climactic capper.  David Lynch uses style to elevate the story to a new level.  Here, there is more style than story.  It's nice to see Karen Black, but beyond that there is not much to attract an audience.

He said that he was excited and anxious in the hospital, until he saw his son for the first time.  He said he managed to maintain the smile of an expectant father, but he said he was horrified at what he saw emerge from his wife's womb.  He said he wanted to turn to the intern who handed his son to him and say: ""Maybe we should put him back in and let him cook a little longer.""As a big Mike Patton fan, I anxiously awaited the release of this movie.  I maintained my smile to about the halfway point.  At that point, I was unable to maintain the smile.  I decided that watching a movie of me watching the movie would've been more entertaining.  It reminded me of a movie done by a film student.  A bad one.  I think the class would've called it a worthy effort, but they would've given it an 'F'.  They would've said that the acting was stilted, it was poorly cut, and it was confusing in a manner that you were sure that the director had not intended.  Patton should probably stick to what he does better than anyone out there right now. Karen Black was good, but her performance wasn't exceptional.  The rest were terrible.  I normally don't enjoy seeing others slam any project that a person has cut blood over, but if I can save one Patton fan the disappointment of seeing him act I'll consider this a worthwhile post.",1,Just Plain Bad,1239667200,"04 14, 2009",2009,1387,"['Bill', 'Cosby', 'once', 'had', 'line', 'birth', 'first', 'son', 'said', 'was', 'excited', 'anxious', 'hospital', 'saw', 'son', 'first', 'time', 'said', 'managed', 'maintain', 'smile', 'expectant', 'father', 'said', 'was', 'horrified', 'what', 'saw', 'emerge', 'wife', 'womb', 'said', 'wanted', 'turn', 'intern', 'who', 'handed', 'son', 'say', 'Maybe', 'should', 'put', 'back', 'let', 'cook', 'little', 'longer', 'big', 'Mike', 'Patton', 'fan', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'release', 'movie', 'maintained', 'smile', 'halfway', 'point', 'point', 'was', 'unable', 'maintain', 'smile', 'decided', 'watching', 'movie', 'watching', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'entertaining', 'reminded', 'movie', 'done', 'film', 'student', 'bad', 'one', 'think', 'class', 'would', ""'ve"", 'called', 'worthy', 'effort', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', 'F', 'would', ""'ve"", 'said', 'acting', 'was', 'stilted', 'was', 'poorly', 'cut', 'was', 'confusing', 'manner', 'were', 'sure', 'director', 'had', 'not', 'intended', 'Patton', 'should', 'probably', 'stick', 'what', 'better', 'anyone', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'Karen', 'Black', 'was', 'good', 'performance', 'was', ""n't"", 'exceptional', 'rest', 'were', 'terrible', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'others', 'slam', 'project', 'person', 'cut', 'blood', 'can', 'save', 'one', 'Patton', 'disappointment', 'seeing', 'act', ""'ll"", 'consider', 'worthwhile', 'post']",N/A

Having Patton and Black take on dual roles was an interesting idea, metaphorically speaking... but in both cases, the need to keep the characters ""different"" led to one persona being shallow and over-acted compared to the other. The mixing of black-and-white and color is a bit of a cliche, and I felt that it, and the soundtrack, were /sometimes/ used as a replacement for building genuine emotional scenes. There were some truly gripping scenes throughout the film, but the lack of character development hurts the film greatly -- only one character shows /any/ growth throughout the story, and she isn't even the protagonist.
