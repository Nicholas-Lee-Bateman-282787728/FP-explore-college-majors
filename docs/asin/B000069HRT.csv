I do not like to watch movies and start feeling I know what is going to happen next.  This did not happen with this movie.,5,Good mystery,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,211,"['dvd', 'held', 'attention', 'beginning', 'end', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'ending', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'movies', 'start', 'feeling', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'movie']",N/A
707219,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B000069HRT,F. S. L'hoir,"[0, 0]","This is the first ""Morse"" that I remember seeing and liking immensely. I recall that I had to acquire a taste for the series (which I now fully appreciate). ""Last Bus to Woodstock"" is a good place to start. The mystery is intriguing and not overly-complex. Both Morse and Lewis are in their prime, and the settings are, of course, magnificent. Among the memorable characters is a rather sweet and sharp-eyed old lady (played by Fabia Drake), who seems to imagine herself as Miss Marple. The acting, as is to be expected, is first rate, and Mr Pheloung's music, with its fascinating 'Morse code', is both familiar and splendid. One has no feeling at all that the film, made in the late '80s, is dated.I took a chance and bought a used copy of a DVD made by Carlton BFS Video. The transfer is excellent; the picture sharp, and there were no scratches or skips. The 'special features' are nothing to write home about: the usual selected filmographies and trivia. And, unfortunately, there is no closed captioning.I'm glad I purchased it though. I'm putting it on the shelf along with my extensive ""Lewis"" collection.",4,Vintage Morse!,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,1113,"['first', 'Morse', 'remember', 'seeing', 'liking', 'immensely', 'recall', 'had', 'acquire', 'taste', 'series', 'now', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'Last', 'Bus', 'Woodstock', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'mystery', 'intriguing', 'not', 'overly-complex', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'are', 'prime', 'settings', 'are', 'course', 'magnificent', 'memorable', 'characters', 'rather', 'sweet', 'sharp-eyed', 'old', 'lady', 'played', 'Fabia', 'Drake', 'who', 'imagine', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'acting', 'be', 'expected', 'first', 'rate', 'Mr', 'Pheloung', 'music', 'fascinating', ""'Morse"", 'code', 'familiar', 'splendid', 'One', 'feeling', 'film', 'made', 'late', ""'80s"", 'dated.I', 'took', 'chance', 'bought', 'used', 'copy', 'DVD', 'made', 'Carlton', 'BFS', 'Video', 'transfer', 'excellent', 'picture', 'sharp', 'were', 'scratches', 'skips', ""'special"", 'features', 'are', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'usual', 'selected', 'filmographies', 'trivia', 'unfortunately', 'closed', 'captioning.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'purchased', ""'m"", 'putting', 'shelf', 'extensive', 'Lewis', 'collection']",N/A

The British seem to do this all the time; at least in the past.

707222,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000069HRT,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","In Last Bus to Woodstock, DCI Morse (John Thaw) and DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) investigate the mysterious death of a young girl, Sylvia Cain, who was working as a secretary at an insurance company. The investigation gets more complicated when Morse discovers that the deceased hitchhiked the night of her death; that her body was found by a young man who was actually waiting for her at a nearby pub that very night; and that an envelope addressed to another woman was found in Sylvia's possession, containing a letter written in code.This is a well-plotted story with many fascinating clues and details that enable viewers to puzzle out the mystery alongside Morse and Lewis. With the help of an astute old woman who happened to be one of the last people to see Sylvia alive that night, Morse and Lewis piece together what happened to Sylvia Cain, with an incredibly amazing conclusion that is also altogether plausible. I am an ardent fan of the Insp. Morse series, where the stories convincingly portray the baser emotions that propel people to commit unimaginable acts against others.",5,One of my favorite Morse episodes,1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,1086,"['Last', 'Bus', 'Woodstock', 'DCI', 'Morse', 'John', 'Thaw', 'DS', 'Lewis', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'investigate', 'mysterious', 'death', 'young', 'girl', 'Sylvia', 'Cain', 'who', 'was', 'working', 'secretary', 'insurance', 'company', 'investigation', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'Morse', 'deceased', 'hitchhiked', 'night', 'death', 'body', 'was', 'found', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'waiting', 'nearby', 'pub', 'very', 'night', 'envelope', 'addressed', 'woman', 'was', 'found', 'Sylvia', 'possession', 'containing', 'letter', 'written', 'code.This', 'well-plotted', 'story', 'many', 'fascinating', 'clues', 'details', 'enable', 'viewers', 'puzzle', 'out', 'mystery', 'alongside', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'help', 'astute', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'one', 'last', 'people', 'see', 'Sylvia', 'alive', 'night', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'piece', 'together', 'what', 'happened', 'Sylvia', 'Cain', 'incredibly', 'amazing', 'conclusion', 'also', 'altogether', 'plausible', 'am', 'ardent', 'fan', 'Insp', 'Morse', 'series', 'where', 'stories', 'convincingly', 'portray', 'baser', 'emotions', 'propel', 'people', 'commit', 'unimaginable', 'acts', 'others']",N/A
