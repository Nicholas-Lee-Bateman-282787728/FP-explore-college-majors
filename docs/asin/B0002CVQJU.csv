For the non-Mormon, there is more than one level of humor: (1) this movie takes the classic comedy formula ""everything that can go wrong must"" to an absurd extreme, (2) the quality of writing & production is somewhat comical in itself, (3) this movie gently pokes fun at some elements of Utah Mormon culture, and (4) the non-Mormon viewer finds humor in ALL elements of Utah Mormon culture, even the ones this movie takes seriously. So whether you're a Mormon or not, if you think Mormons are funny, you will find this movie funny.I do not recommend this movie to just any non-Mormon viewer, though. Without some knowledge of Mormon beliefs & culture (and the more the better), a lot of the humor will be lost on you, and you will probably just find the movie boring.",4,Especially hilarious for non-Mormons,1101945600,"12 2, 2004",2004,841,"['other', 'reviewers', ""'m"", 'not', 'Mormon', 'found', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'non-Mormon', 'more', 'one', 'level', 'humor', '1', 'movie', 'classic', 'comedy', 'formula', 'everything', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'must', 'absurd', 'extreme', '2', 'quality', 'writing', 'production', 'somewhat', 'comical', '3', 'movie', 'gently', 'fun', 'elements', 'Utah', 'Mormon', 'culture', '4', 'non-Mormon', 'viewer', 'finds', 'humor', 'ALL', 'elements', 'Utah', 'Mormon', 'culture', 'even', 'ones', 'movie', 'seriously', ""'re"", 'Mormon', 'not', 'think', 'Mormons', 'are', 'funny', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'funny.I', 'do', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'just', 'non-Mormon', 'viewer', 'though', 'knowledge', 'Mormon', 'beliefs', 'culture', 'more', 'better', 'lot', 'humor', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'will', 'probably', 'just', 'find', 'movie', 'boring']",The RM

I was in this church for a while and still have friends in that church, so to me it was very funny. The writers of this movie didn't miss many stereotypes or realities of Mormon culture and still made them funny without being offensive. As a woman, the scenes of Relief Society competition among the women (although it would never be called that in the church) were especially funny, as were the juxtaposed scenes of the women's and men's meetings. The scenes of the cookies being delivered through the mail slot and the mother making an ice sculpture of the Salt Lake Temple with a chain saw had me doubled over, barely able to breathe, I was laughing so hard. Even with all the humor, there was an underlying message of perseverance and integrity throughout the movie so that anyone of any belief could understand and be touched by it.

830651,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B0002CVQJU,Nicholas Carroll,"[36, 40]","Before reviewing this film, I must put a disclaimer up front...I'm not LDS but spent 3 years at BYU, so I know the Mormon culture quite well, from the outsider's perspective.  The flood of LDS films in the new century is a welcome relief and quite possibly is due to the conflicts I witnessed at BYU between their editing of Hollywood movies to the annoyance of the Hollywood industry, especially the battles with ""Titanic"" (when I was at BYU) and the controversial anti-Mormon film ""Orgazmo""(which was one of the worst movies I've ever seen).This film, ""The RM"" follows on the heels of ""The Singles Ward"" and while I thought the jokes were stretched thin in ""The Singles Ward"", I found the humor in this film more spread out and funnier overall.  This film pokes fun at the expectations that RMs have upon returning from their mission, from a big Welcome Home celebration, to reuniting with one's girlfriend, getting one's job back, and a new respect from family, friends and fellow churchmembers.  To the dismay of Jared Phelps (the returned Missionary), life seemed to have moved on for everyone else while he had been away for two years.  His attempts to readjust to life outside the mission field offer plenty of laughs, though one would most likely have to be familiar with LDS Culture to understand and appreciate.One thing I never understood about the LDS is that even though they believe in eternal marriage, why on earth would a person not want to wait until the mission is over to marry the ""love of her life"".  The rush to marry an RM is all too real in Happy Valley.  It all works out in the end for Jared Phelps, despite a mischievious best friend who gets him in trouble with the law (which seems more a contrivance than a realistic development in order to move the film along to a climatic conclusion).For me, the funniest scenes in the movie regards the ponzi salesmanship scheme that people are involved in.  At one company that Jared briefly works for, each time a person makes a sale, they have a hilarious cheer that is all too real for anyone familiar with some of the companies in Utah Valley and the promises of high salaries for successful salesman.  It is interesting that Returned Missionaries easily adapt to this line of work, since peddling the Book of Mormon door to door gives them the experience of salesmanship and how to deal with rejection/door slams.After seeing this film, I hope that Halestorm will continue to make films about the Mormon experience in modern society.  Its nice to see a positive reflection of a people I've come to love represented in inexpensively made, yet high quality, good acting films.  Hopefully they will spend more time working on quality stories with more plausible plots.  The talent is definitely there and there are so many more stories worth telling.",4,A good LDS Comedy from the makers of the Singles Ward,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,2821,"['reviewing', 'film', 'must', 'put', 'disclaimer', 'up', 'front', ""'m"", 'not', 'LDS', 'spent', '3', 'years', 'BYU', 'know', 'Mormon', 'culture', 'quite', 'well', 'outsider', 'perspective', 'flood', 'LDS', 'films', 'new', 'century', 'welcome', 'relief', 'quite', 'possibly', 'due', 'conflicts', 'witnessed', 'BYU', 'editing', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'annoyance', 'Hollywood', 'industry', 'especially', 'battles', 'Titanic', 'when', 'was', 'BYU', 'controversial', 'anti-Mormon', 'film', 'Orgazmo', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', '.This', 'film', 'RM', 'heels', 'Singles', 'Ward', 'thought', 'jokes', 'were', 'stretched', 'thin', 'Singles', 'Ward', 'found', 'humor', 'film', 'more', 'spread', 'funnier', 'overall', 'film', 'fun', 'expectations', 'RMs', 'have', 'upon', 'returning', 'mission', 'big', 'Welcome', 'Home', 'celebration', 'reuniting', 'one', 'girlfriend', 'getting', 'one', 'job', 'back', 'new', 'respect', 'family', 'friends', 'fellow', 'churchmembers', 'dismay', 'Jared', 'Phelps', 'returned', 'Missionary', 'life', 'seemed', 'have', 'moved', 'everyone', 'else', 'had', 'been', 'away', 'two', 'years', 'attempts', 'readjust', 'life', 'mission', 'field', 'offer', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'one', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'be', 'familiar', 'LDS', 'Culture', 'understand', 'appreciate.One', 'thing', 'never', 'understood', 'LDS', 'even', 'believe', 'eternal', 'marriage', 'why', 'earth', 'would', 'person', 'not', 'want', 'wait', 'mission', 'marry', 'love', 'life', 'rush', 'marry', 'RM', 'too', 'real', 'Happy', 'Valley', 'out', 'end', 'Jared', 'Phelps', 'mischievious', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'trouble', 'law', 'more', 'contrivance', 'realistic', 'development', 'order', 'move', 'film', 'climatic', 'conclusion', '.For', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'ponzi', 'salesmanship', 'scheme', 'people', 'are', 'involved', 'one', 'company', 'Jared', 'briefly', 'works', 'time', 'person', 'sale', 'have', 'hilarious', 'cheer', 'too', 'real', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'companies', 'Utah', 'Valley', 'promises', 'high', 'salaries', 'successful', 'salesman', 'interesting', 'Returned', 'Missionaries', 'easily', 'line', 'work', 'peddling', 'Book', 'Mormon', 'door', 'door', 'experience', 'salesmanship', 'how', 'deal', 'rejection/door', 'slams.After', 'seeing', 'film', 'hope', 'Halestorm', 'will', 'continue', 'make', 'films', 'Mormon', 'experience', 'modern', 'society', 'nice', 'see', 'positive', 'reflection', 'people', ""'ve"", 'come', 'love', 'represented', 'inexpensively', 'made', 'yet', 'high', 'quality', 'good', 'acting', 'films', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'working', 'quality', 'stories', 'more', 'plausible', 'plots', 'talent', 'definitely', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'stories', 'telling']",The RM
