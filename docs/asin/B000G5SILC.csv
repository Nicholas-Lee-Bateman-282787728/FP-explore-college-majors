998857,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000G5SILC,A Customer,"[19, 20]","A mediocre, instantly forgettable espionage American government crime thriller, The Sentinel plays out more like a trumped-up network television show than a fully-fledged motion picture crime thriller. This fractured, overly convoluted tale of a spy within the Secret Service who is trying to assassinate the President is so laughable and implausible that you'll end up being cynically amused at most of what goes on.The movie is totally dumb, and gets even dumber as it goes on. Michael Douglas - who indeed seems to be fighting the hands of time - plays Special Agent Pete Garrison. A few years back, he slept with the wife of his best friend and prot&eacute;g&eacute;, David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland). Now he's having an affair with first lady Sarah Ballentine (Kim Basinger).When Pete receives incriminating photos of himself and Sarah he realizes he's being blackmailed. At the same time he also learns that there's a ""mole"" working in the secret service plotting to assassinate the president. Things go really haywire when he realizes that someone's trying to frame him as the perpetrator.Beaten into a corner and in danger of being charged with treason, Garrison goes on the run, partly in order to clear his name and also to hopefully uncover the real architects behind presidential assassination plot. But Breckinridge stays hot on his tale, chasing his former pal with the gorgeous rookie (Eva Longoria) who adds a bit of glamour to the chase. (Eva Longoria as a Secret Service Agent?).Unfortunately The Sentinel doesn't really work that well. Apart from that fact that you can figure out whom the mole is after about twenty minutes, director Clark Johnson allows his pursuit scenes to run on for far too long. Most of the action is made up of a lot of gratuitous running, crouching, skulking around corners, aiming guns and shooting them. This of course gets a bit boring when carried on for so long.Johnson uses jerky camera work to heighten suspense and to make the film look a little more prestigious that it really is, but this ends up being annoying instead. The same can be said about the film's overpowering background music as well as its choppy editing. And are the Secret Service really this efficient and on top of things in the real world? When you think of how the government has handled recent tragedies, something tells me they're not.The Sentinel becomes even more preposterous as it lurches along. The rationale behind the assassination plot is murky at best. And then there's the big, hugely far-fetched shoot-out at the close, which suggests that infiltrating a small army of gunmen into an international assembly that is supposed to be a G8 summit must be the easiest thing in the world to do. It's also never really made that clear whom the gunmen actually are, but at least the scenes are shot in Toronto so we get to see some of the City.The movie gradually sinks into a pit of conspiracy clich&eacute;s, from the D.C. detective who talks like he's from a Manhattan borough to Pete's unkempt on-the-street informer who seems to know everything. Even worse, the characters lack in-depth development. It's also criminally sloppy writing when towards the end of the movie Sutherland's Breckinridge changes his attitude towards Garrison for the flimsiest of reasons.The performances are pretty much what you see is what you get. Douglas goes through his usual tight-lipped shtick - you would think after thirty years in the business he'd be stretching himself and taking on more interesting roles. Sutherland does his TV show spiel and Longoria - who is never going to the world's greatest actress - is wasted in a role anybody could have phoned in. And Basinger looks svelte and gorgeous but offers little beyond her appearance as a meek and decorous First Lady.

Loads of action and a plot that doesn't completely slip into the absurd as is so often the case with modern movies.Michael Douglas plays Secret Service agent Pete Garrison.  He is having an affair with the US President's wife (Kim Basinger).  This information comes to the attention of a group intent on killing the President.  Garrison is suspended from the service when he fails a polygraph test although this test is not directly related to the affair.  Garrison is simply collateral damage.In the process of redeeming himself, Garrison is isolated and is seen as a threat to the service itself.  He becomes a fugitive.  He has no where to turn.As the plot reaches its climax, Garrison's new understanding of events becomes the general knowledge.  The real threat to the President is actually a mole within the service.  Garrison emerges as a hero.While the plot is formulaic, the action grips the viewer.  Almost two hours seems to fly past as one is kept on the edge of one's seat.

In that film, he seemed to fit the role like a glove: he was fit and dashing, and was believable.

Im a huge Douglas fan, but I felt he was trying to play a younger person's role, and it didn't work. The plot seemed a bit too far-fetched, and I ended up hoping the end would come soon.

The movie, a political thriller set in Washington DC, was so uninspiring that I found it hard to put my thoughts into words. I guess the main point is you should not watch this movie for Keifer Sutherland. If you're a 24 fan, then you might be intrigued by this movie. It is one of Sutherland's few big screen appearances since becoming the star of 24. In Sentinel, Sutherland plays Jack Bauer without the motivation, the nuances or the common sense. You'll see nothing new in Sutherland. Eva Longoria plays his rookie partner. The movie needed a good looking cast member for a thankless, generic part, so they got someone with a name. Michael Douglass and Kim Basinger also star and they both are good in their roles and made the movie someone tolerable. In fact, I enjoyed parts of the movie and most of the cast was on top of their game, but the suspense and action scenes were clumsily put together and hard to follow.Michael Douglass plays a secret service agent assigned to First Lady. It seems he had a falling out with Sutherland concerning Sutherland's wife.

The result is terrible and loaded with plot holes.Michael Douglas stars as Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who ""took one"" for Reagan during the attempt on his life. Years later we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse Family, mainly as a guard for the First Lady (Kim Basinger, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Troubles arise as we see Pete's close involvement with the First Lady, and a sudden threat against the President himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete fails a polygraph test, he's singled out as a disgruntled agent by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series).As the presidential assassination plot unfolds, Pete finds himself on the run from his own people. His only confidant is the First Lady, and she's reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another (which is why Pete failed the polygraph in the first place). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the President? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the Secret Service?The one, big, overwhelming problem with this film is that there's no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat. Isn't that what the movie's supposed to be about? One would think so! But the audience is never let in on why the assassin(s) want to kill the Prez. Hmm.

998868,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B000G5SILC,Boss Fan,"[7, 7]","Here's the thing about ""The Sentinel:""  It is one of those movies you've seen a dozen times before in various incarnations, and often done better, but most often done worse.  That this movie has a TV show, miniseries, direct-to-DVD, and/or decade-or-two-past feel to it is about the worst thing that can be said about it.  Alas, that is all true.  But there are other movies you could say the same about that, if I saw them bashed, I would go to the mat in defense of (anyone remember Wesley Snipes in the taunt, but underrated because of it generics thriller ""Murder at 1600?"").Like the buddy cop thrillers, teen slasher movies, one man army flicks from Stallone and Schwarzenegger, and the Steven Seagal/Van Damme type action pics, Hollywood used to crank these political potboilers out in droves in the 80's and 90's.  So it is only fitting that this film stars Michael Douglas, Kiefer Sutherland and Kim Basinger, since this movie is a product of their film-career heydays; not to mention they have all covered similar territory before in a number of films.  The parts in this movie are a stretch for no one.  Kiefer Sutherland does Jack Baur-lite, Michael Douglas wears a suit, beds the babe and spends the movie trying to figure out a lofty conspiracy and clear his name at the same time.  Granted, Eva Langoria has never played a Secret Service agent to my knowledge, but then again she doesn't much play one here either.  Still her presence is the one way that when we look back on this movie in 10 or 15 years, we won't confuse it for something that came out in 1993.None of this makes ""The Sentinel"" bad, but it is a little disappointing that the makers didn't realize that their film was generic and try to do something to overcome the genre conventions.  All of this plays out pretty much how you'd expect.  No surprises or big twists.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a tight, straightforward thriller, and ""The Sentinel"" isn't exactly predictable, but it's never particularly engaging.  You want to see how it all ends up, but the outcome is like any other.  Of course, it is possible the makers wanted to deliver more of a Secret Service procedural, and on that level, and on the general skill of the cast and director, ""The Sentinel"" earns a recommendation.Here is a quote from the film critic at The Onion that sums up just what I was thinking after this movie:  ""Here's the problem facing the generic political thriller ""The Sentinel:"" Television is still free. As standards continue to rise and TV more readily turns out first-rate action serials, the bar has been raised for Hollywood cinema, and air-conditioning alone isn't its salvation. No one should know that better than Clark Johnson, a seasoned director of superior cop shows like ""The Shield,"" and star Kiefer Sutherland, whose heads up one of TV's tensest hours in ""24."" For the most part, the professionals on both sides of the camera know how to deliver the goods: ""The Sentinel"" gets the job done, supplying a steady mix of action and intrigue without embarrassing itself too much. Yet any given episode of The Shield or 24 is more densely plotted, more surprising, and considerably deeper in characterization.""Well, that's pretty much what I just said, and that is pretty accurate.  Even if you loved this movie, you should be able to admit to that.  But again, if that's the worst that can be said about a movie, it's probably still worth checking out.If you want to see a Secret Service thriller done right, Clint Eastwood's ""In the Line of Fire"" remains the high standard.",3,"Standard, but not bad.",1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,3559,"['Here', 'thing', 'Sentinel', 'one', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozen', 'times', 'various', 'incarnations', 'often', 'done', 'better', 'most', 'often', 'done', 'worse', 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'miniseries', 'direct-to-DVD', 'decade-or-two-past', 'feel', 'worst', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Alas', 'true', 'are', 'other', 'movies', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'saw', 'bashed', 'would', 'go', 'mat', 'defense', 'anyone', 'remember', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'taunt', 'underrated', 'Murder', '1600', 'buddy', 'cop', 'thrillers', 'teen', 'slasher', 'movies', 'one', 'man', 'army', 'flicks', 'Stallone', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Steven', 'Seagal/Van', 'Damme', 'type', 'action', 'pics', 'Hollywood', 'used', 'crank', 'political', 'potboilers', 'out', 'droves', '80', '90', 'only', 'fitting', 'film', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'movie', 'product', 'film-career', 'heydays', 'not', 'mention', 'have', 'covered', 'similar', 'territory', 'number', 'films', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'stretch', 'one', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Jack', 'Baur-lite', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'suit', 'babe', 'movie', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'lofty', 'conspiracy', 'clear', 'name', 'same', 'time', 'Granted', 'Eva', 'Langoria', 'never', 'played', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'knowledge', 'then', 'again', ""n't"", 'much', 'play', 'one', 'here', 'either', 'Still', 'presence', 'one', 'way', 'when', 'look', 'back', 'movie', '10', '15', 'years', 'wo', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'something', 'came', 'out', '1993.None', 'Sentinel', 'bad', 'little', 'disappointing', 'makers', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'film', 'was', 'generic', 'try', 'do', 'something', 'overcome', 'genre', 'conventions', 'out', 'pretty', 'much', 'how', ""'d"", 'expect', 'surprises', 'big', 'twists', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'tight', 'straightforward', 'thriller', 'Sentinel', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'predictable', 'never', 'particularly', 'engaging', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'up', 'outcome', 'other', 'course', 'possible', 'makers', 'wanted', 'deliver', 'more', 'Secret', 'Service', 'procedural', 'level', 'general', 'skill', 'cast', 'director', 'Sentinel', 'recommendation.Here', 'quote', 'film', 'critic', 'Onion', 'up', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'movie', 'Here', 'problem', 'facing', 'generic', 'political', 'thriller', 'Sentinel', 'Television', 'still', 'free', 'standards', 'continue', 'rise', 'TV', 'more', 'readily', 'out', 'first-rate', 'action', 'serials', 'bar', 'been', 'raised', 'Hollywood', 'cinema', 'air-conditioning', 'alone', ""n't"", 'salvation', 'one', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'Clark', 'Johnson', 'seasoned', 'director', 'superior', 'cop', 'shows', 'Shield', 'star', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'heads', 'one', 'TV', 'tensest', 'hours', '24', 'most', 'part', 'professionals', 'sides', 'camera', 'know', 'how', 'deliver', 'goods', 'Sentinel', 'job', 'done', 'supplying', 'steady', 'mix', 'action', 'intrigue', 'embarrassing', 'too', 'much', 'given', 'episode', 'Shield', '24', 'more', 'densely', 'plotted', 'more', 'surprising', 'considerably', 'deeper', 'characterization', 'Well', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'just', 'said', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'Even', 'loved', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'admit', 'again', 'worst', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'probably', 'still', 'worth', 'checking', 'out.If', 'want', 'see', 'Secret', 'Service', 'thriller', 'done', 'right', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Line', 'Fire', 'high', 'standard']",N/A

When an off duty Secret Service Agent is gunned down outside his home, talk begins to circle about a plot to kill the President and a potential MOLE among the Secret Service. So, when SSA Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas) fails a polygraph, the heat is not far behind.All sounds very intriguing, and it is, but the problem is with the delivery. Watching the film, it seemed like an entire season of 24 crammed into a 2 hour movie. There was SO MUCH going on. Bad guys. Possible bad guys. Moles. Possible moles. Affairs. Suspected Mole on the lamb. Informants. Assassins. A shoot out in a public place. Murders. Secrets. It all seemed too choppy.The movie sort of has an empty feeling. People do heroic things, but they didn't grab my gut. Shocking things happen, but the movie is so hyperactive that you never truly get the desired feeling from it. Characters are established, but not really fleshed out... like Jill Marin (Eva Longoria). We meet her. We see how swift she is and why she has gotten this new job, but by the end of the film, we realize that she wasn't all that necessary cause she didn't do much.But the main gripe I have is the lack of exploration and explantion given to the BRAINS behind the assassination plot. You never truly feel the danger from them because you don't know them. Why are they dangerous? Why are they doing what they're doing? There personalities are only highlighted but not given enough attention.Finally, there are a couple of VERY questionable incidents involving the bad guys. Why would the assassin open fire in a crowded mall where everyone can see him? Not only that, but why would he instigate it? They didn't know who he was. What's he shopping for anyway? The second incident would give away too much of the ending, but the brains behind the operation seemed to leave his brain in the trunk when he got there.Then of course, there was the cheesy 80s music ending. I was completely expecting Michael Douglas, as he walked away from the capital, to jump into the air, kick his heels together with glee which would be captured in freeze frame glory.The SENTINEL could have been a good film. Kiefer Sutherland is his solid self, playing David Breckinridge, a variation of Jack Bauer from 24. Michael Douglas is real, sympathetic and solid. Yet, the rest of the characters are one dimensional, not unlike the story and the execution.It's not a horrible way to spend a couple of hours, but had I spent money to see this at the movie theatre, I would have REALLY been disappointed.

Perhaps he looked too old for all that running around but, then, those guys do keep in good shape.Oh, yes, as to the picture. I liked it. It was a good action picture by a competent group of actors and a director who knew that one of the secrets of using a hackneyed plot, as most film plots are, is to keep up a fast pace so that people don't have slow stretches in which they might start thinking of all the holes you are trying to paper over. Douglas handles himself as the old pro he is as do the other younger pros. I suppose, before we learned what  some Presidents have been doing in the White House (and, presumably, at other locations) it might have seemed a bit of a stretch to have the First Lady involved; now, of course, I shouldn't think it raised even a flicker of ""oh, that could never happen"".So, not much to say that is not reported in the description of the film and the previous reviewers remarks. There is more than enough to grab and hold your attention until the end without any depressing thoughts about reality to jar your involvement.Now its two years later and I have just seen the DVD again.

Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas) is a veteran member of the White House Security but has some problems: his ex-partner David (Kiefer Sutherland), convinced that Pete slept with his wife, is suspicious of Pete; Pete is having an affair with the President's wife (Kim Bassinger); Pete is pulled into dangerous territory trying to cover his secret and use a reliable old informer (Raynor Scheine) to give him clues; a new officer appears on the scene to accompany David and is a friend, Jill (Eva Longoria).  Once the evidence points to Pete as the planner of the assassination he is the victim of a chase, a chase that eventually uncovers the true insider perpetrator of the plot.The action is well paced and the actors make their roles as credible as possible.  One of the best parts of the film is the musical score by the very talented Christophe Beck who finally gets to demonstrate his skills as an orchestrator.  The fault of the film lies in the seemingly ignored fact that when well known actors are placed in a suspense movie and given very little to do except in the beginning, then the fact that they are in the cast points a big finger that they are going to be the true culprit - and that is very much the case here.

If handled by a good director or caring cast that is. Douglas is the one who is framed. Basinger is the First Lady, with whom he is having an affair (an undeveloped, unresolved plot contrivance). Sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he didn't. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with a fortune of Maybelline and...that's it. I guess there are less requirements for women when entering the Secret Service. As usual in a film like this the role of the Prez himself is nothing more than a tool, a token and is very badly written.Clark Johnson's, he who gave us the equally as pathetic SWAT back in 2003, mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV-movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and phone-in their performances from afar. Eva Longoria, the most over-exposed woman of the 21st Century, is basically only in this to attract to the Desperate Housewives audience.

Is it because the Kazakhs have built a pipeline to sell their oil to China instead of building a pipeline across Afghanistan and Iran and Irak to sell their oil to the US ? The president ot the USA is the most wanted president in the world at least by would-be terrorists and assassins. It is true that a fair number of US presidents have been assassinated or assaulted. But hasn't it always been by Americans, and even in this case it is said to be impossible without an American mole inside the secret services ? Forget it, man, the second cold war has just been declared by Hollywood. Of course the US president gets out of it unscathed. But the film becomes ridiculous when it states a sexual affair between the oldest of the security agents and the First Lady. Both ridiculous and absurd, including pictures of the sexual meeting between the two inside the First Lady's bedroom. That is really more than a mole.

As far as the film is concerned, Clark Johnson does a good job of directing and the performances are good, but it's a little too flat as far as some of the key players. Of course Douglas and Sutherland are good, but Longoria doesn't really have much to do other than stand around looking hot, and pretty much the same thing with Basinger. Martin Donovan, who is a brilliant indie actor, and has shown such in films like AMATEUR and TRUST, just seems very out of his element here.

I know it may sound like an utterly trite, common-sense lesson, but the fact that this movie turned out the way it did shows that there are people out there in Hollywood who have not yet learned. This movie had a really solid cast, a big budget, and an exciting premise. And yet, from beginning to end, viewers are served up forgettable characters with poorly-developed back-stories, going through the motions in a plot that never hooks their interest. I watched the whole movie and could care less about Michael Douglas's fugitive character. This one does not measure up to the level of The Fugitive (1993). It is definitely more on par with say, U.S. Marshals (1998).In fact, the only thing about this film that is worthy of discussion is which of its many facets was the most one-dimensional? There is a serious competition going on between: the main-character's relationship with the first lady, his feud with Keifer Sutherland's character, the secret plot to kill the President, the rookie agent played by Eva Longoria, and finally the question of which member of the Secret Service is a mole.The film's climax and subsequent resolution one finds boring, banal answers to all of those questions that they never really cared much about to begin with. The overall impact on the viewer was virtually non-existent. This movie was lighter than air.Overall, I think a 3 stars' is reasonable mark: the movie could have gone straight to the TV (as some other users say).

Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland are still in good form though. Douglas plays a secret service agent who finds himself wanted after failing a lie detector test.

Sutherland plays a former partner and friend of his that is now after him to bring him in. Eva Longoria is good too as Sutherland's new sexy partner in training who also looks up to Douglas' character and doesn't like having to chase him.Newsday gave both Firewall and the Sentinel * 1/2 stars saying that Harrison Ford and Michael Douglas are basically too old for roles that have them in action. I disagree though, especially about Michael Douglas. He's in great shape here and looks pretty good for his age. I guess this isn't that much of a new role for him though. I mean how many movies has he done where he's having an affair ? lol. Still though it's fun seeing this guy in action, no not the kind of action we see him in, in Basic Instinct lol. He's good here as a secret service agent, maybe not as good as Clint Eastwood in In The Line of Fire, but still really good.

Michael Douglas plays Garrison, a secret agent whose inability to keep his pants on has cost him his best friend (secret agent Breckinridge, played by Sutherland) and compromised his position as head of security for the first lady (and he's the hero!). Some guys with various foreign accents want to murder the president and suspicion of being the mole in the secret service supplying them with information falls on Garrison. By an amazing coincidence, the agent chosen to bring in Garrison is Breckinridge. From then on the movie follows a pattern we've all seen many times before- Garrison fleeing, the secret service after him, the bad guys setting up a plot with the real mole, Garrison searching for evidence to clear himself and prevent the conspirators from succeeding in their vile machinations and the climactic gunfight at the OK Corral, or in this case Toronto City Hall.It's not a terrible movie, the action is exciting and the cinematography is good- some great views of Toronto, which was my home town for 25 years.

Mike Douglas did a good job in this and Keifer seems to be a turning in another '24' performance for this movie.  Eva is put in as eye candy, but the role could have been filled with any other female with little effect to the movie.  In a surreal move, they chose Dave Rasche as the president of the USA.  I kept expecting him to pull out a Magnum huge 44 caliber gun and say 'trust me. I know what I'm doing'  (sledgehammer! reference, sorry.) [perfect MST3K fodder]Allright, sum up time.  The goods... it is 'fast paced', but when you see where it will eventually lead it gets a little tired and you just want it to resolve already.  All the production and performances are good.  Kim Basinger is under-utilized as Mrs. President.  The bads... Hollywood goes too far in trying to lay down how credible this could all be.  The first 5 minutes they painstakingly show security features, code words, plans, scenarios and all the trappings of 'secret service'.  Towards the end, it all unravels and common sense has you asking 'why is he doing this?'  'why isn't he shot already?'etc.. etc...Its not that bad... its not that great either.

998908,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000G5SILC,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[6, 8]","""The Sentinel"" isn't a movie I entirely expected to like, although I've wanted to see it since it was in theatres. Even though the plot is different, it kept bringing to mind another movie released this year called ""Firewall."" Even while watching this movie, I thought it was similar to ""Firewall"" in many ways...But I also found myself entertained by it. Now presidential assassination movies are almost a cliche by now; but a few good ones do come around. My favorite movie of this kind is ""In the Line of Fire."" It was entertaining, well acted, made sense, and was a great film. The Sentinel has good performances, it's entertaining, but it doesn't always make sense. It's never really explained why the people in this film want to kill the president. Even if they just want to do it to do it, they could've told us that. Inside Man told us the bankrobbers just wanted to do it in the beginning. Anyway, Oscar winner Michael Douglas (Best Actor, 'Wall Street') plays Pete Garrison, a Secret Service agent who once took a bullet for Ronald Reagan. Years later, Pete is having an affair with the first lady (Kim Basinger) and is at odds with his former best friend David Breckinridge (a marvelous Kiefer Sutherland), also a Secret service agent. See David is under the impression that Pete had an affair with his wife. Anyway, through a rat, Pete discovers that there's a mole in the Secret Service who's helping terrorists plot to kill the President. At the same time, Pete is getting anonymously blackmailed for his affair with the first lady and, as a result of that, evidence is piling up on the fact that Pete maybe the mole. Now with the entire Secret Service after him, including David and his new partner Jill (Eva Longoria, who's got some good acting chops away from Wisteria Lane). This movie has its share of cliches. There was a few times where I was watching this movie and thinking to myself ""that sounds/looks familiar."" I saw the end coming from a mile away. But, the ending quickly redeems itself (from my point-of-view anyway) with the relationship between Pete and the first lady not going in the direction you'd think. A lot of people won't like this film for reasons I've mentioned and more...But if you want some semi-mindless entertainment (although this movie has its smart characteristics blending in with its flaws), then The Sentinel is actually a pretty good way to pass the time. Due to its flaws, with only the fact that I enjoyed it to support my case, I should give it 4 stars...But I think that it's worthy enough of 5.Entertainment goes a long way.GRADE: A-",5,Very Entertaining.,1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,2592,"['Sentinel', ""n't"", 'movie', 'entirely', 'expected', 'like', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'theatres', 'Even', 'plot', 'different', 'kept', 'bringing', 'mind', 'movie', 'released', 'year', 'called', 'Firewall', 'Even', 'watching', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'similar', 'Firewall', 'many', 'ways', 'also', 'found', 'entertained', 'Now', 'presidential', 'assassination', 'movies', 'are', 'almost', 'cliche', 'now', 'few', 'good', 'ones', 'do', 'come', 'favorite', 'movie', 'kind', 'Line', 'Fire', 'was', 'entertaining', 'well', 'acted', 'made', 'sense', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'Sentinel', 'good', 'performances', 'entertaining', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'sense', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'why', 'people', 'film', 'want', 'kill', 'president', 'Even', 'just', 'want', 'do', 'do', 'could', ""'ve"", 'told', 'Inside', 'Man', 'told', 'bankrobbers', 'just', 'wanted', 'do', 'beginning', 'Anyway', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Best', 'Actor', ""'Wall"", 'Street', 'Pete', 'Garrison', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'who', 'once', 'took', 'bullet', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'Years', 'later', 'Pete', 'having', 'affair', 'first', 'lady', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'odds', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'David', 'Breckinridge', 'marvelous', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'also', 'Secret', 'service', 'agent', 'See', 'David', 'impression', 'Pete', 'had', 'affair', 'wife', 'Anyway', 'rat', 'Pete', 'mole', 'Secret', 'Service', 'who', 'helping', 'terrorists', 'plot', 'kill', 'President', 'same', 'time', 'Pete', 'getting', 'anonymously', 'blackmailed', 'affair', 'first', 'lady', 'result', 'evidence', 'piling', 'up', 'fact', 'Pete', 'maybe', 'mole', 'Now', 'entire', 'Secret', 'Service', 'including', 'David', 'new', 'partner', 'Jill', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'who', 'got', 'good', 'acting', 'chops', 'away', 'Wisteria', 'Lane', 'movie', 'share', 'cliches', 'was', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'thinking', 'myself', 'familiar', 'saw', 'end', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'ending', 'quickly', 'redeems', 'point-of-view', 'anyway', 'relationship', 'Pete', 'first', 'lady', 'not', 'going', 'direction', ""'d"", 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'reasons', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'more', 'want', 'semi-mindless', 'entertainment', 'movie', 'smart', 'characteristics', 'blending', 'flaws', 'then', 'Sentinel', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'way', 'pass', 'time', 'Due', 'flaws', 'only', 'fact', 'enjoyed', 'support', 'case', 'should', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'think', 'worthy', 'enough', '5.Entertainment', 'long', 'way.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

They are a group of people that many Presidents have trusted with their lives for many years, and for many more to come.  There has never been a traitorous agent in all the years the Secret Service has existed, until now.  At least that is the premise for the movie ""The Sentinel"", starring Keifer Sutherland and Michael Douglas.""The Sentinel"" begins with the Secret Service dealing with the standard, every day threats that the President receives on his life.  But when a plot on the President's life appears to involve a traitorous Secret Service agent, and the evidence points to one of the most decorated agents in the service, Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas), this threat becomes anything but standard.  As two federal investigators (Keifer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) are pursuing all the facts and zeroing in on the traitorous agent, the only thing Garrison, who knows he is being framed, can do is go on the run and try to prove his innocence by finding those responsible.Let me say that the premise of the movie is one of pure fiction, there has never been a traitor within the Secret Service, the men and women that serve in this job continue day in and day out to put their lives on the line to protect one man and his family no matter the cost.  With that being said, lets move on to my thoughts on the movie at hand.When I saw the trailers for this movie, I instantly wanted to see it.  For two reasons, 1) I was a fan of Keifer Sutherland's work on Fox's hit show ""24"", and 2) the story seemed intriguing and looked like it would be a really solid action movie, with a good mystery thrown into the mix.  Now that I've finally watched the movie, I have to say that I thought it was really well done, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  All of the actors did excellent jobs, Michael Douglas even surprised me with how physical he was for as old as he is.  Keifer Sutherland turned in a solid performance, though this role didn't test him much, since he was essentially playing his character Jack Bauer from ""24"".  Eva Longoria and Kim Basinger rounded out the main cast, and both managed to do very well with not a whole lot of screen time.  The story was very well put together, with plenty of suspense to keep things interesting, and the mystery element was a nice touch to shake things up a bit.  Although the final reveal of who was behind the whole thing wasn't all that big of a surprise for me, I had the character pegged fairly early on.  Even though I had a strong suspicion as to who was the traitor, that didn't bring the movie down for me at all.  This may have been helped by the amount of detail that was shown as to what the Secret Service must go through every day to ensure the safety of the President and his family, which was really interesting to witness.I'm sure after watching this movie that any President, past, present, or future, will be very appreciative of the loyal service provided by these good men and women, but they may also be a little suspicious that one of them may betray them someday.  It's a scary thought, but a realistic one, when you know someone else is holding your life and the lives of your loved one in their hands.""The Sentinel"" is rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, and sensuality.",4,Never Let Your Guard Down...,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,3365,"['purpose', 'United', 'States', 'Secret', 'Service', 'protect', 'lives', 'President', 'family', 'costs', 'are', 'group', 'people', 'many', 'Presidents', 'have', 'trusted', 'lives', 'many', 'years', 'many', 'more', 'come', 'never', 'been', 'traitorous', 'agent', 'years', 'Secret', 'Service', 'existed', 'now', 'least', 'premise', 'movie', 'Sentinel', 'starring', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Sentinel', 'Secret', 'Service', 'dealing', 'standard', 'day', 'President', 'life', 'when', 'plot', 'President', 'life', 'involve', 'traitorous', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'evidence', 'points', 'one', 'most', 'decorated', 'agents', 'service', 'Pete', 'Garrison', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'threat', 'anything', 'standard', 'two', 'federal', 'investigators', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'are', 'pursuing', 'facts', 'zeroing', 'traitorous', 'agent', 'only', 'thing', 'Garrison', 'who', 'being', 'framed', 'can', 'do', 'go', 'run', 'try', 'prove', 'innocence', 'finding', 'responsible.Let', 'say', 'premise', 'movie', 'one', 'pure', 'fiction', 'never', 'been', 'traitor', 'Secret', 'Service', 'men', 'women', 'serve', 'job', 'continue', 'day', 'day', 'put', 'lives', 'line', 'protect', 'one', 'man', 'family', 'matter', 'cost', 'being', 'said', 'move', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'hand.When', 'saw', 'trailers', 'movie', 'instantly', 'wanted', 'see', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'was', 'fan', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'work', 'Fox', 'hit', 'show', '24', '2', 'story', 'seemed', 'intriguing', 'looked', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'solid', 'action', 'movie', 'good', 'mystery', 'thrown', 'mix', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'watched', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'bit', 'actors', 'did', 'excellent', 'jobs', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'even', 'surprised', 'how', 'physical', 'was', 'as', 'old', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'turned', 'solid', 'performance', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'test', 'much', 'was', 'essentially', 'playing', 'character', 'Jack', 'Bauer', '24', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'rounded', 'out', 'main', 'cast', 'managed', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'mystery', 'element', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'bit', 'final', 'reveal', 'who', 'was', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'surprise', 'had', 'character', 'pegged', 'fairly', 'early', 'Even', 'had', 'strong', 'suspicion', 'who', 'was', 'traitor', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'movie', 'down', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'helped', 'amount', 'detail', 'was', 'shown', 'what', 'Secret', 'Service', 'must', 'go', 'day', 'ensure', 'safety', 'President', 'family', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'witness.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'watching', 'movie', 'President', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'appreciative', 'loyal', 'service', 'provided', 'good', 'men', 'women', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'little', 'suspicious', 'one', 'may', 'betray', 'someday', 'scary', 'thought', 'realistic', 'one', 'when', 'know', 'someone', 'else', 'holding', 'life', 'lives', 'loved', 'one', 'hands', 'Sentinel', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'brief', 'language', 'sensuality']",N/A

Michael Douglas does a competent job as the aging experienced Secret Service agent, Garrison, who's framed by Russian agents seeking to kill the President, he portrays the ""aging"" part especially well.  Kiefer Sutherland portrays his former protege and detail commander pursuing Garrison with authority and Eva Longoria is better than expected as the requisite rookie Secret Service agent.  The last half dissolves in predictable denouements and is sloppy, leaving several loose ends,and is very unsatisfactory overall.  I can understand why used copies of this DVD are available for $0.01 from sellers under ""fulfillment by Amazon"".Several professional reviewers indicated this movie was mediocre, but one reason I watched it was it was directed by Clark Johnson, whom I have a soft spot for from his long-standing role as Detective Meldrick Lewis in the seminal TV series Homicide: Life on the Streets.  He did a reasonable directing job with the 2003 remake of ""S.W.A.T."", as well as several episodes of ""The Wire"".  This movie is definitely not a credit to his directing skills.  The characters are shallow and undeveloped, especially Michael Douglas and Kim Basinger, but also Kiefer Sutherland.  The assassins remain mysterious, as do their motives for assassinating the President.  The action sequences are unimaginative and pedestrian.  I did enjoy one bit of trivia:  in the midst of the movie, a Secret Service agent is heard telling his colleagues the punchline to a joke, ""The bear says, 'Now you really didn't come here to hunt.'""  Clark Johnson, the director and actor portraying the Secret Service agent who is assassinated early in the film, told the same punchline as Detective Lewis in Homicide: Life on the Streets.  ""The Sentinel"" is overall not worth purchasing or even renting.  It is not a credit to its actors or director and I hope Clark Johnson can redeem his directing career with much better movies or quality TV shows.",2,passable predictable thriller with little texture,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",2010,2012,"['first', 'half', 'Sentinel', 'engaging', 'unexceptional', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'competent', 'job', 'aging', 'experienced', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'Garrison', 'who', 'framed', 'Russian', 'agents', 'seeking', 'kill', 'President', 'aging', 'part', 'especially', 'well', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'former', 'protege', 'detail', 'commander', 'pursuing', 'Garrison', 'authority', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'better', 'expected', 'requisite', 'rookie', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'last', 'half', 'dissolves', 'predictable', 'denouements', 'sloppy', 'leaving', 'several', 'loose', 'ends', 'very', 'unsatisfactory', 'overall', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'used', 'copies', 'DVD', 'are', 'available', '0.01', 'sellers', 'fulfillment', 'Amazon', '.Several', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'indicated', 'movie', 'was', 'mediocre', 'one', 'reason', 'watched', 'was', 'was', 'directed', 'Clark', 'Johnson', 'whom', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'long-standing', 'role', 'Detective', 'Meldrick', 'Lewis', 'seminal', 'TV', 'series', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Streets', 'did', 'reasonable', 'directing', 'job', '2003', 'remake', 'S.W.A.T', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'episodes', 'Wire', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'credit', 'directing', 'skills', 'characters', 'are', 'shallow', 'undeveloped', 'especially', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'also', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'assassins', 'remain', 'mysterious', 'do', 'motives', 'assassinating', 'President', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'unimaginative', 'pedestrian', 'did', 'enjoy', 'one', 'bit', 'trivia', 'midst', 'movie', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'heard', 'telling', 'colleagues', 'punchline', 'joke', 'bear', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'here', 'hunt', 'Clark', 'Johnson', 'director', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'who', 'assassinated', 'early', 'film', 'told', 'same', 'punchline', 'Detective', 'Lewis', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Streets', 'Sentinel', 'overall', 'not', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'even', 'renting', 'not', 'credit', 'actors', 'director', 'hope', 'Clark', 'Johnson', 'can', 'redeem', 'directing', 'career', 'much', 'better', 'movies', 'quality', 'TV', 'shows']",N/A

He does an adequate job of keeping the action moving.  Following ""Timeline"" with Peter Walker & ""Oceans 12,"" screenwriter George Nolfi's 3rd screenplay bears some of the problems why this film doesn't work completely.  The major problem is that Michael Douglas' character is part hero & anti-hero.  As a loyal patriot trying to protect the president, we cheer him on.  But as the two-timing adulterer who has an affair with the First Lady, we wonder how stupid he really is & how can a hero be morally inferior?  This is the crux for me of why it's hard to cheer for the film.However, given the material, Michael Douglas turns in a good performance as Pete Garrison.  It's been a long time since Douglas first broke on the scene with TV's ""The Streets of San Francisco"" & since his 1987 Oscar for ""Wall Street.""  He still brings a good studied intensity to the screen and gives a believable performance, while not really addressing why this man has character flaws that lead him to cheat on the president.  For the story's purpose, it is this vulnerability that leads to Garrison's compromise and pursuit to prove his innocence.Other actors also do a good job.  Kim Basinger who won her Oscar a decade after Doglas (1997) for ""L.A. Confidential"" does a good job as Sarah Ballentine.  She exudes a studied elegance that well suits a first lady, but again we fail to understand why she's so overcome with passion for Douglas.  Kiefer Sutherland who won the Golden Globe for TV's ""24"" in 2001 and has appeared in the movies in ""Eye of the Killer,"" ""Phone Booth,"" & ""Taking Lives,"" does a good job as David Breckinridge who bears a grudge against his former best friend, but seeks out the truth.  Eva Longoria from ""Desperate Housewives"" on TV does a by-the-book performance as Jill Maren.  Blair Brown cameos as the press secretary.  David Rasche does a good job as a president.  His is a familiar face from films like ""United 93"" & ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.""

He's risen through the ranks, and his current job is head of the First Lady's (Kim Basinger) security detail.Complicating his life, he and the first lady have fallen in love and are having a secret affair.  Someone has found out, however, and sent the incriminating pictures to Pete.Meanwhile, Walter (Raynor Scheine), a former informant of Pete's, tells him someone is planning to kill the President (David Rasche).  When the little intel that Walter was willing to part with proves true, the Secret Service springs into action.  They have a mole in their department and need to find him or her before the murder takes place.Unfortunately, the clues begin pointing to Pete.  Internal investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland) is convinced Pete's the mole.  Pete has no choice but to take off and find the truth himself.  But can he do that without being arrested?I'll admit, I was lured to see this movie based on TV advertisement placement.  I am a huge fan of the show 24, and this movie looked like it could be similar.  Plus it starred that show's Kiefer Sutherland.Unfortunately, this movie didn't live up to my high expectations.  The story is weak.  Things came to the main characters, especially Pete, way too easily.  I like seeing characters search for the information they need.  Several pieces of information came so quickly, I had to guess how the character figured things out.  That's hardly good story telling.And don't even get me started on the climax.  Several characters, including the villain, behave in completely illogical ways.  Additionally, one plot thread is dropped, giving no resolution to that aspect of the story.Since this is a thriller, I expected some tense moments.  While I will admit to jumping a time or two, most of the time I wasn't pulled into the story.  I cared about the characters, but the scenes that should have had me on the edge of my seat were rather ordinary.The thing that works in this movie is the characters.  The actors do a great job of making us care about what happens.  Michael Douglas is in most every scene and does a fine job.  Kiefer Sutherland gets to play the guy we're all hoping our hero can work around to save the day, a switch from his 24 character.  He's up to the part.  Not being a fan of Desperate Housewives, I hadn't seen Eva Longoria before, but she does a great job of playing the rookie caught between the two leads.  Finally, Kim Basinger makes a great First Lady.Another thing that sets this movie apart is the setting.  Not only do we get great shots of Washington, DC, but we get to see the inside workings of the Secret Service, something I had no idea about.  I found those parts of the movie fascinating.  Additionally, several scenes take place in the country, and the settings are beautiful.Honestly, this felt like half a movie, with scenes cut out from start to finish.  I'm sure if I'd been able to see the whole movie, this would have been great.  If you're interested, it's worth seeing, but wait for the DVD.",3,"Clearing Your Name, Savings the President.

998923,AAW58LG72PG7I,B000G5SILC,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[1, 2]","THE SENTINEL is a film that leads with strong performances by Michael Douglas and Kiefer Southerland, both of whom are Secret Service agents who face the daunting prospect of uncovering an assassin mole in their midst. The film partially succeeds to the extant that director Clark Johnson tries mightily to engage the viewer in the day to day minutia of how the Service protects the President.  The major problem here is that the assassin mole plot is presented in a manner that guarantees to choke off that interest due to poor scripting. First, we have Douglas as Agent Pete Garrison who is having an affair with the First Lady (Kim Basinger). It strains credulity that any agent would compromise his position as bodyguard let alone that the First Lady would do likewise.  There is simply no need for this romance since its reverberations are not permitted to flesh themselves out in a manner that impacts on the plot. It is there solely for the titillation.  Next, there is the ill-defined plot to frame Garrison as the mole.  Nowhere does anyone bother to explain why he was chosen to be the mole.  If the true mole wanted anonymity, he would not have called attention to himself with a red herring.  Then there is Kiefer Southerland as Agent Breckinridge, who is no more than Jack Bauer reborn from 24.  The mid portion of the film reminded me of the chase scenes from US MARSHALS in which one cop tracks another.  Yet, it was these scenes which carried the movie.  There is never any doubt that the chase will end with one agent catching another. The crux of the film dissolves into a mess in which we are asked to believe that the extraordinary efforts of the Secret Service to protect the President are so easily thwarted by a renegade who, believe it or not, began his career as a spy for the KGB. And just as Douglas and Southerland take the high road in their cat and mouse game, so do Basinger and Eva Longoria as Agent Marin take the low road in their collective inability to be little more than eye candy who take their cues from powerful men.

There were no real surprises, but everyone connected with the movie delivered great performances that allowed the story to progress at a rapid, suspenseful pace that never broke.Michael Douglas stars as Pete Garrison, a seasoned Secret Service agent who took a bullet meant for Ronald Reagan.  He's ageing comfortably well and spending his life in service to the office of the President as a personal protector to the First Lady.  Unfortunately, Garrison has also fallen in love with Sarah Ballentine and he's been compromised for some time.In short order, a plot to kill the president is discovered.  All indications are that the plot is coming from within the Secret Service.  They go on a mole hunt at the same time one of Garrison's confidential informers tells him about the mole.  Someone also knows about Garrison's affair with the first lady.After a few tense cat-and-mouse moments, Garrison is placed in the cross-hairs of the Secret Service investigation.  His one-time best friend David Breckinridge (Keifer Sutherland) comes after him with a vengeance because he believes Garrison had an affair with his wife.  Eva Longoria stars as new Secret Service recruit Jill Marin.The movie evolves into a series of chases and mystery-solving that runs tight and neat to the end, although it doesn't really break any new ground.

The cast is very good -- Michael Douglas, Kiefer Sutherland, Eva Longoria and Kim Basinger -- and the film is well written and directed. Douglas plays a secret service agent who is having an affair with the First Lady (Basinger).

Douglas is accused of being the mole and must find the real traitor in order to clear his name and save the President.

Basinger is beautiful as usual and convincingly portray's the First Lady vulnerability, but its same old, same old for her. Eva Longoria comes off very well as Sutherland's assistant.

This time though, the threat seems to be coming from a mole inside the Secret Service.  David Breckinridge (Sutherland) and newbie Jill Marin (Longoria) are on the case, as Pete Garrison (Douglas), who's been on duty for 20 years and ""took a bullet for Reagan"", has been set up (that's about 25 minutes into the movie).  Thus the running and chasing begins as Garrison tries to find who set him up, and incidentally who blackmailed him with pictures of him having an affair with the First Lady (Basinger).The action is fairly good and so is the acting.  After a slow start the movie finds its pace and becomes a pleasant experience.  Douglas and Sutherland are both good actors and they're cast well here.  What's asked of Douglas, action-wise, doesn't pass as ridiculous (unlike Harrison Ford in ""Firewall""), so it's a fairly decent movie.  Eva Longoria shows up for about 15-20 minutes, and other than eye-candy you have to wonder what she's doing there.There lies the problem with the movie.  It's illogical and offers no explanations.  First off, you're never told why they're trying to murder the president, and you're not even allowed a slightly educated guess because you don't really have enough elements, other than that ex-KGB agents are involved.  Then it's seriously illogical and quite ridiculous when it comes to the Secret Service.  Ok, I'll allow myself to believe there's the possibility of a mole, but they fall for the dumbest tricks ever, and you have to wonder where they got their training and how no one's managed to get to the president before that.It's also fairly predictable, if you want to figure it out before the end.  Which actually leads to the problem that for a movie with this theme (of which there have been at least 30), the answer is way too simple, which in some way is the point of it, I guess. I went way more out there when I took a stab at it during the movie, and the ending ended up dissapointing me.On the whole, it's an OK movie that's risen to a tad above average thanks to a great cast, that's entertaining without being too ridiculous, which is really all you can ask for for this type of film.",3,Another one bites the dust,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,2235,"['day', 'movie', 'attempt', 'murder', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'time', 'threat', 'be', 'coming', 'mole', 'Secret', 'Service', 'David', 'Breckinridge', 'Sutherland', 'Jill', 'Marin', 'Longoria', 'are', 'case', 'Pete', 'Garrison', 'Douglas', 'who', 'been', 'duty', '20', 'years', 'took', 'bullet', 'Reagan', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'about', '25', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Thus', 'running', 'chasing', 'begins', 'Garrison', 'find', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'incidentally', 'who', 'blackmailed', 'pictures', 'having', 'affair', 'First', 'Lady', 'Basinger', '.The', 'action', 'fairly', 'good', 'so', 'acting', 'slow', 'start', 'movie', 'pace', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'Douglas', 'Sutherland', 'are', 'good', 'actors', ""'re"", 'cast', 'well', 'here', 'What', 'asked', 'Douglas', 'action-wise', ""n't"", 'pass', 'ridiculous', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Firewall', 'fairly', 'decent', 'movie', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'up', '15-20', 'minutes', 'other', 'eye-candy', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'doing', 'there.There', 'problem', 'movie', 'illogical', 'explanations', 'First', 'off', ""'re"", 'never', 'told', 'why', ""'re"", 'trying', 'murder', 'president', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'allowed', 'slightly', 'educated', 'guess', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'enough', 'elements', 'other', 'ex-KGB', 'agents', 'are', 'involved', 'Then', 'seriously', 'illogical', 'quite', 'ridiculous', 'when', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Ok', ""'ll"", 'allow', 'believe', 'possibility', 'mole', 'fall', 'dumbest', 'tricks', 'ever', 'have', 'wonder', 'where', 'got', 'training', 'how', 'one', 'managed', 'get', 'president', 'that.It', 'also', 'fairly', 'predictable', 'want', 'figure', 'out', 'end', 'Which', 'actually', 'problem', 'movie', 'theme', 'have', 'been', 'least', '30', 'answer', 'way', 'too', 'simple', 'way', 'point', 'guess', 'went', 'way', 'more', 'there', 'when', 'took', 'stab', 'movie', 'ending', 'ended', 'up', 'dissapointing', 'whole', 'OK', 'movie', 'risen', 'tad', 'average', 'thanks', 'great', 'cast', 'entertaining', 'being', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'really', 'can', 'ask', 'type', 'film']",N/A

Well, now I've seen it, and I think I know why-- I'm guessing Fox, once it saw the finished product, was a bit reluctant to release it. That, or embarrassed. Clark Johnson (probably best remembered for his acting-- he played Meldrick Lewis on the wonderful Homicide: Life on the Street) is very good at directing for the small screen-- he's done some great work on The Shield, including the pilot episode-- but as his big-screen adventures have shown, it's not translating well.The plot, for those of you who missed it in the trailers: Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas), a decorated Secret Service member, is accused of being a mole. His former best friend, David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland), is pursuing the case with, shall we say, a good deal of overeagerness thanks to a fallout between the two some years before. Meanwhile, the real mole is planning something dastardly having to do with the President (United 93's David Rasche).Much of the movie's lackluster pace and overall silliness can be pinned on scriptwriter George Nolfi (whose previous claim to fame was Ocean's Twelve; need I say more?), but its disheveled appearance is all on Johnson. You'd think someone who can make The Shield almost palpably slimy would be able to work with this stuff. And I've never quite figured out why it's so tough for successful TV directors to make the switch to the big screen, but The Sentinel provides more evidence for the hypothesis that it's so. **",2,"As much as I like Clark Johnson, I can't get behind this one.",1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,1631,"['Sentinel', 'Clark', 'Johnson', '2006', 'Back', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'little', 'confused', 'got', 'very', 'little', 'marketing', 'movie', 'cast', 'as', 'respectable', 'one', 'Well', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'think', 'know', 'why', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Fox', 'once', 'saw', 'finished', 'product', 'was', 'bit', 'reluctant', 'release', 'embarrassed', 'Clark', 'Johnson', 'probably', 'best', 'remembered', 'acting', 'played', 'Meldrick', 'Lewis', 'wonderful', 'Homicide', 'Life', 'Street', 'very', 'good', 'directing', 'small', 'screen', 'done', 'great', 'work', 'Shield', 'including', 'pilot', 'episode', 'big-screen', 'adventures', 'have', 'shown', 'not', 'translating', 'well.The', 'plot', 'who', 'missed', 'trailers', 'Pete', 'Garrison', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'decorated', 'Secret', 'Service', 'member', 'accused', 'being', 'mole', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'David', 'Breckinridge', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'pursuing', 'case', 'shall', 'say', 'good', 'deal', 'overeagerness', 'thanks', 'fallout', 'two', 'years', 'Meanwhile', 'real', 'mole', 'planning', 'something', 'dastardly', 'having', 'do', 'President', 'United', '93', 'David', 'Rasche', '.Much', 'movie', 'lackluster', 'pace', 'overall', 'silliness', 'can', 'be', 'pinned', 'scriptwriter', 'George', 'Nolfi', 'previous', 'claim', 'fame', 'was', 'Ocean', 'Twelve', 'need', 'say', 'more', 'disheveled', 'appearance', 'Johnson', ""'d"", 'think', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'Shield', 'almost', 'palpably', 'slimy', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'work', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'never', 'quite', 'figured', 'out', 'why', 'so', 'tough', 'successful', 'TV', 'directors', 'make', 'switch', 'big', 'screen', 'Sentinel', 'more', 'evidence', 'hypothesis', 'so', '**']",N/A
998943,AE8OXO15XK9NW,B000G5SILC,Robert Boyle,"[8, 10]","A ""sentinal"" (or sentry) stands watch, exercises  vigilance and generally keeps an eye on things to protect the integrity of what (s)he is charged with guarding.  This film could have used its own sentinal, for it has many good things in it worth defending, but is spoiled by bad storytelling, cobbled and disjointed to the point that one wants to send it back to the screenwriters for another draft session.  This is a great disappointment, as the film has so many potential assets (as other web critics have pointed out:  a good cast, good sets, good cinematography, etc., etc.  As others have adequately covered the plot synopsis and pointed out the specific major defects, I offer my own list of additional comments:(1) Originality:  Some complain (wrongly) that this film has an unoriginal plot. It is a genre film; just as westerns end up with a confrontation between the good cowboy and the villain, mysteries end up with the detective solving the case, and romances end with the couple getting together in the end (light romance) or are prevented by circumstance from ever getting together (dark romance).  Originality does not begin and end with ""a new story""; if it did, there would be less than a couple of dozen movies (of all kinds) in the last century.  Just as a portrait painter relies on the freshness of detail (and his/her skills as a painter) in rendering a person's likeness, rather than attempt a rearrangement of basic facial features -- ""*two* noses -- how original!""), movie ""originality"" lies mainly with the art of telling of the story (even if the story framework is not itself oringinal ).  Look at successful and intriguing (and non-original) genre films that fit into the categories I have just cited:  ""The Unforgiven"" (godd-guy-vs-bad-guy-western), ""A Perect Murder"" (not only a flat-out remake of an archtype murder mystery, but a Michael Dougls film!), ""Sleepless in Seattle"" (light (as a souffle) romance that captured the public's heart), and ""Brokeback Mountain"" (despite its ""controversial"" subject matter, a tragic love story whose basic structure and content (""unrequited and forbidden"" true love frustrated by circumstance) is lifted straight out of the Middle Ages (""Tristan and Isolde"" and Troilus and Cressida"" comes to mind).Originality in these stories (does anyone think of Clint Eastwood's ""The Unforgiven"" as a *formulaic* western?) comes from the carefully worked out details, not the ""original subject, or gimmick"".  If this sort of shallow ""originality"" was what the filmmakers (and the public) were really seeking, ""The Sentinal"" could have ended with First Lady Basinger and Agent Douglas eloping to Tahiti -- or to Cincinatti.  Even better:  First Lady Basinger and Agent Longoria tending sheep at Brokeback Mountain -- well, it *would* be ""origina""l.2) Acting:  the main character actors and even most of the supporting cast are good actors who did a fine job -- as fine as the film would allow.  I don't need to defend any of them.  Douglas and Sutherland are in their element, having grown into the sort of roles their fathers played so well, while Kim Basinger actually makes her physical age an asset in her role as a first lady (married to a comparably aged president), and manages to make her presence as a government dignitary (and not as a Bond girl, as she once was) believable.Much has been made of Eva Longoria, either as an acting hack, or as mere eye-candy.  This simply is not fair; she did what she could with an extremely limited and -- as some here have observed -- a secondary or even tertiary role.  Anyone who has seen her in converstion on late night talk shows -- even better as the guest host on ""Saturday Night Live"" -- know her to be an intrelligent, bright, quick, sharp and highly talented, trained and versatile (her rendition of Lucy Ricardo on SNL was dead-on and deadly funny) actor for whom ""Desperate Housewives"" should be no more than a thespic stepping stone.  Her acting abilities (heck, even Britney Spears' acting abilities) are not tapped in this film.  She is given so little to do (she doesn't even get to fetch coffee for the guys) and has so little interaction with the other characters (or involvement in the plot), it is surprising that she even took the role (except as a platform for better roles, -- may she get them).(3) The real problem -- and this is what is so disappointing about ""The Sentinal"" -- is that its viewers come in with reasonably high expectations for an intelligent, slick, suspenseful summer thriller, and don't get to see one.  The problem lies partly with the screen writing (did the writers even read-aloud their own script?) and mostly with the incredibly disjointed presentation of the story.  Blame the writers, the film editor, continuity, the director -- whoever is responsible for such things, and who let this draft of a film slip through the production process.  This film has the same structural flaws that a comedy does in which the delivery is not well-set-up, the punchlines are blown, and the essential ""atmosphere"" is not established, much less maintained.  One only has to look to ""In the Line of Fire"" to contrast the expertise in generating a taut, suspenseful and constantly engaging film.  (ITLOF was NOT ""original"" -- it, too, was a ""genre film"", of a kind going back more than fifty years -- but it was served up well.)  The ""flow"" of ""The Sentinal"" is attention-deficit-disorder-slug-like, the individual scenes so poorly cobbled together and the sequence of events so disjointed there is no chance for suspense, or even casual interest, to germinate.  Other critics talk of loose plot ""threads"".  This is a complete understatement.  There are a huge number of ""threads"" so short and loose they come out as dryer lint. (Only) one excruciatingly annoying example offered here:  the laborious, utterly pointless and thoroughly baffling (for the audience) ""Las Palmas Restaurant"" sequence.  Douglas is summoned (by mysterious phone call) to meet with ""someone"" who never shows up (think of Samuel Beckett's play, ""Waiting for Godot"").  Brushing aside the fact that many minutes of film time are spent with the audience watching Douglas pretending to read a newspaper (for four hours!) to no clear end (the putative purpose of this scene is to frame a ""link"" between Douglas and a drug cartel, a which is dispelled -- flatly dismissed -- soon after (as the plot clock ticks away).  A junior writer would have excised this entire scene (along with a confusing and unproductive and suspense-killing mall-chase scene that falls flat), or, made something substantial out of it.  This time killing episode contrasts sharply with, say, Douglas at the restaurant (or in other scenes) in ""The Game"", where every second exudes fear, uncertainly and suspense thick enough to carve into slabs.""The Sentinal"" could have *easily* been tweaked into at least decent summer suspense fare -- had anyone in charge bothered to do so.  The actors' (and other's) talents have been wasted in this film, along with the audience's time, money and patience.  This is sad.  Hollywood certainly knows how to make a good action/suspense film -- it does it all the time.  This movie is like a half-baked dish prepared by a distracted -- or perhaps lazy, cynical and disgruntled -- chef.  It ought to have been sent back and finished properly, if only out of respect for the patrons (audience) and restaurant staff (actors, et al) who entered this project in good faith, but were set up as badly as Douglas's secret service character.  -RDB",2,Good Project Crippled by Production's Sheer Indifference and Sloppiness,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,7555,"['sentinal', 'sentry', 'watch',

998952,A1F2L30AG4GGET,B000G5SILC,"Steven James ""Author of the Patrick Bowers se...","[4, 4]","In ""The Sentinel"" Michael Douglas stars as a veteran Secret Service agent who comes under suspicion when a plot to assassinate the president is uncovered. Keifer Sutherland plays David Breckinridge, the internal investigator who's assigned to rooting out the mole. Depending on your point of view, Sutherland plays the part to perfection (or to annoyance) as he rushes about with the same intensity (and expressions and gestures and gusto) as his ""24"" character.Eva Langoria is the rookie agent who assists Sutherland in his search for the traitor and Kim Basinger plays the weary model wife of the president who has a secret life that might cause her husband political death if it ever comes to light.This movie, despite it's thrilling trailer and talented cast, hit the box office with a thud. Here are three reasons why:1. The editing is choppy. Scenes begin and end randomly. Characters move about in inexplicable ways. As you watch the movie you get the impression that about fifteen scenes that would have helped the story make sense were deleted at the last minute.2. The pacing is uneven. The movie starts out with flashy ""kill the president"" logos / memos / charts reminiscent of ""Seven"" but then, it's as if another director picked up the movie in mid-stream and decided not to keep that part of the story going. Often the story lurches forward and then slows to a snail's pace. Weird.3. The plot is sketchy. We never really learn the motivation for the assassination attempt, the whole subplot with the informant is ridiculous, and rather than frighten us, the bad guys are almost laughable as they stomp around shooting at people.All of the actors bring an earnestness to the screen and some of the scenes while Douglas is eluding capture are clever, but in the end they're not clever enough to make up for the plot pitfalls.If you're really looking for a movie about an older Secret Service agent who's trying to protect the president against an elaborate assassination attempt, skip the mediocre ""Sentinel"" and watch the much better 1993 flick ""In the Line of Fire.""",3,not at the top of it's game,1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,2080,"['Sentinel', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'veteran', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'who', 'suspicion', 'when', 'plot', 'assassinate', 'president', 'uncovered', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'David', 'Breckinridge', 'internal', 'investigator', 'who', 'assigned', 'rooting', 'out', 'mole', 'Depending', 'point', 'view', 'Sutherland', 'part', 'perfection', 'annoyance', 'same', 'intensity', 'expressions', 'gestures', 'gusto', '24', 'character.Eva', 'Langoria', 'rookie', 'agent', 'who', 'Sutherland', 'search', 'traitor', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'weary', 'model', 'wife', 'president', 'who', 'secret', 'life', 'might', 'cause', 'husband', 'political', 'death', 'ever', 'light.This', 'movie', 'thrilling', 'trailer', 'talented', 'cast', 'hit', 'box', 'office', 'thud', 'Here', 'are', 'three', 'reasons', 'why:1', 'editing', 'choppy', 'Scenes', 'begin', 'end', 'randomly', 'Characters', 'move', 'inexplicable', 'ways', 'watch', 'movie', 'get', 'impression', 'fifteen', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'story', 'make', 'sense', 'were', 'deleted', 'last', 'minute.2', 'pacing', 'uneven', 'movie', 'out', 'flashy', 'kill', 'president', '/', 'memos', '/', 'charts', 'reminiscent', 'Seven', 'then', 'director', 'picked', 'up', 'movie', 'mid-stream', 'decided', 'not', 'keep', 'part', 'story', 'going', 'Often', 'story', 'forward', 'then', 'snail', 'pace', 'Weird.3', 'plot', 'sketchy', 'never', 'really', 'learn', 'motivation', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'whole', 'subplot', 'informant', 'ridiculous', 'rather', 'frighten', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'almost', 'laughable', 'stomp', 'shooting', 'people.All', 'actors', 'bring', 'earnestness', 'screen', 'scenes', 'Douglas', 'eluding', 'capture', 'are', 'clever', 'end', ""'re"", 'not', 'clever', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'plot', 'pitfalls.If', ""'re"", 'really', 'looking', 'movie', 'older', 'Secret', 'Service', 'agent', 'who', 'trying', 'protect', 'president', 'elaborate', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'skip', 'mediocre', 'Sentinel', 'watch', 'much', 'better', '1993', 'flick', 'Line', 'Fire']",N/A

998958,AMLV3B3JDF4HD,B000G5SILC,The Kite,"[5, 5]","With approximately fifteen kazilion schmillion movies made in the past century, the question we as audience member must ask ourselves is, are we being too demanding if we expect originality in every new film? Hmmm... my answer? Yes and no. Who wants to watch something totally bizarre or un-life like simply because it's ""different"" or who wants to watch something so cookie-cutter we can almost quote it top to bottom simply from reading the back of DVD? Its a delicate balance. Do we make a movie that twists and turns, surprising but potentially confusing the viewer? OR do we stick with the good ol' tried and true recipe, a familar friend but potentially TOO familiar?So where does The Sentinel fall? Well lets examine. We've got a president in trouble, we've got a high-profile afair, we've got two ex-best friend's having to work with and then against and then again with each other, we've got a hot rookie agent and we've got a mystery mole in the mix. If this doesn't ring any bells, I think its safe to consider yourself an absentee from the last several decades of cop/president/political films. But the pleasant surpise we get from this film is that, while it does ring bells, they probably won't start ringing till after you've left the theatre.How did they pull THAT off? I can think of three reasons.1) The Pre-Promo of the movieA problem I have seen in the film industry is that, in promoting a film(interviews, articles, previews, clips,etc.), they sell more than whats there. But the problem with this method is that movies must suceed long after the teaser trailer to make good profit. Content matters, of course. So the tricky part is selling a movie that will appeal to the masses but not decieve them into thinking they're getting something different or better than what will actually happen on the screen. The Sentinel did this much better than ALOT of movies that have come out recently. The preview told you what the movie was about, who the movie was about and what the general genre and feel would be for the movie WITHOUT giving away several ""extra"" or ""to-be-discovered"" plot details. This really is a great assett. When I went in, I had a level of expectation that was easily met which made me able to just sit back and enjoy the movie and not think about what I THOUGHT about the movie till after it was done.2) The PacingBless the screenwriter for the script and dialogue. At every moment I thought it would get cheesy or drawn-out, there were usually just a couple words and then a change of scene. Occasionally, I can enjoy and be somewhat-inspired by a passionate soliliqy.... but typically, unless its a Shakespeare-written or beautiful person-given speech, I'm simply enduring it for sake of the rest of the movie. Here, the pace never goes so fast and furious that you need too long of a breather. On the other hand, its not at all halting. Whatever is happening is interesting and moves along. This tactic can save even a mediocre movie simply because it leaves you no time to get bored while not exhausting you.3) The ActorsTruly, this is what makes or breaks the movie. Actors have the chance to really brighten a gosh-awful script or really sour a beautiful story. Believe me, it was no accident that Michael Douglas is in all but about thirty seconds of this movie(for an older actor, this guy has some serious stamina!). He IS his character, through and through and absolutely demands your attention when on screen. Brilliant actor. Sutherland was his typical terribly likable half-asleep self and Bassinger is, as always, solid. Longoria is ok. Her character seems like an after-thought and she's got the unmistakable TV-actor-aura about her but it was a good step into a potentially succesful movie career.So there's the good. But, sadly, I've got two things against this movie that swings it from the 4-Star ""Very Watchable"" catagory to the 3-Star ""Pretty Stinkin' Mediocre"" catagory.1) The StoryWhile its pretty fun when you're watching it, we all see whats coming for miles. Luckily, we're not set up to expect a huge twist but are rather drawn to focus on the drama of the characters or else the Mole would have been a bigger let down. The story line was familiar but pretty enjoyable all the way till the end when you start glancing around the theatre wondering, ""Did we just get suckered into enjoying another repeat script from Hollywood?"" Suddenly you recognize the characters for who they are... the faithful but flawed hero, the law-abiding agent and his hot pants assistant, the weepy first-lady, and, above all, the perfectly-underdevolped-but-familar, not-striking-but-averagely- handsome ""bad guy"".2) The After TasteThe good thing is, this movie is fun to watch. The bad thing is, you won't want to watch it twice. And you won't really think about it again. And you won't really talk about it. Its good, but it's merely a 2006 film... 07 and on will know nothing of it.This movie is certainly in the top percentile of its kind and I would reccomend it if I ever happen to think of it when talking about movies with people, which isn't likely. Enjoy the watch and then forget it.

Pete is a legend in the force, as he took a bullet for Regan during the Hinkley shooting. Now, he is content to help protect the First Lady, serving alongside Montrose (Martin Donovan), the Secret Service agent protecting the President (David Rasche). One of Pete's friends, another agent by the name of Charlie Merriweather (Clark Johnson, TV's ""Homicide"" and the film's director), is killed. David Breckenridge (Keifer Sutherland) and his new partner, a rookie, Jill Marin (Eva Longoria) are called in to investigate. David is a former best friend of Pete's and Jill was trained by Pete. An informant tells Pete there is a plot to assassinate the President. Soon David suspects Pete of the murder and the plot and Pete has to work on his own to uncover the mastermind behind the attempt to assassinate the President.""The Sentinel"", directed by Clark Johnson, is an okay entry in the thriller genre. Certainly one of Michael Douglas' best efforts in a while (Mr. Douglas, see ""Don't Say a Word"" for an example of what NOT TO DO again), the film holds your attention for a while, but is rife with problems.From the moment the plot is revealed, there are basically three people who could be at the heart of the plot to assassinate the President. The film does a fairly good job of throwing doubt on all three. In fact, it does such a good job that the final revelation is a letdown. In fact, when we learn who is behind the plot, an earlier scene makes little sense. They seem to be sabotaging their own effort. Presumably, we are supposed to believe the characters is having second thoughts, but this isn't adequately conveyed. So typical. It would have been much more fun to have a more outlandish mastermind, someone who really stretched the credibility. That way, if the film did its work and provided all of the clues, we would have a very memorable exercise, something we could tell all our friends about. As it is, this is the type of film you would recommend to people who read every James Patterson novel and remark ""It was pretty good. Almost as good as the last one"". (Get it. They're all the same!)In fact there are many things which aren't adequately conveyed. In an early scene, as Pete is walking to work, he passes a protester who is protesting Bush and another war. Huh? The President in the film is named Ballentine. Is the protester caught in a time warp? This is an insignificant example, but it shows the type of attention paid to the story and the film.Douglas does a good job with the role. Pete puts his heart and soul into the job and we believe wholeheartedly he could never be the mastermind. While this is good for the performance, it also hinders the film. It removes yet another person from the equation. If Pete can't have done it, it leaves a smaller circle of suspects. As he goes about his job, we see the professionalism, the attention to detail he brings to everything. Later, when a secret is revealed about Pete, it makes his character all the more interesting. It simply proves he isn't perfect.I am a huge fan of the television series ""24"" and it has resuscitated Keifer Sutherland's career. Unfortunately, I feel the character of Jack Bauer (from ""24"") is so memorable, that Sutherland is getting typecast in `Government Operative' roles. David Breckenridge is a softer, gentler government agent, but not by much. He has a bone to pick with Pete, because of some bad history, which causes him to pursue the leads like a rabid dog. He has a job and will let nothing, nothing stand in his way. The role is extremely similar to Jack Bauer, but Breckenridge does manage to show a little humanity. Very late in the film.Eva Longoria's first big screen appearance is a bit disappointing. Her character Jill Marin doesn't really play an integral part to the story. She seems to be included merely to give the male Secret Service Agents something to oogle at. When she first arrives at the White House, there is an ongoing interaction with one of Breckenridge's assistants. He can't keep his eyes off of her. It is an amusing touch, but it doesn't add anything to the story and seems an odd addition. Later, as the mechanics of the investigation get into gear, she becomes a true supporting character. ""Jill, did you get those fingerprints."" ""Yes, they are a match"". This is the type of interaction she is reduced to, as the two male leads are running all over the place, trying to solve the mystery. It is basically a role anyone could have played.Director Johnson does manage to keep the action moving. But throughout the film, he overuses a technique, wearing the effectiveness down. Early on, he starts shooting things as we might see them if we were on a surveillance team. A lot of long distance shots, through telephoto lens, with abrupt moves and zooms. It is interesting, but when the majority of the camera movements are done with this technique, it makes them less effective. It also jars us out of the story when we are constantly aware that there is a camera. The key to an effective film is when we feel as though we are a participant. If you draw attention to the fact that we are watching a film, we can't feel as though we are a participant. It feels like an exercise in filmmaking, not an exercise in storytelling.Late in the film, Breckenridge seemingly shifts his character 180 degrees and suddenly becomes Pete's ally. This shift is entirely unconvincing, because it happens so quickly and isn't sufficiently explained or detailed.""The Sentinel"" is a mildly entertaining film, worthy of a bargain matinee or DVD rental. Much more than that and you will probably feel like you have paid too much.",3,The Classic Story of Good Vs.

998961,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B000G5SILC,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[0, 0]","I was attracted to this film as I was amidst its filming in Washington. (In fact, it's amazing how much control the movie studios have over DC while they're shooting a film. Most thought the scenes were presidential motorcades. They were actually retakes from the film.)To summarize, Michael Douglas plays Pete Garrison, a secret service agent. His colleague, David Breckenridge, played by Kiefer Sutherland, used to be Douglas's best friend, until Breckenridge alleges Garrison had an affair with his wife--NOT. Frankly, I had a little problem with their being such close friends. Sutherland might be closer to one of Douglas's son's friends. But that's minor. Sutherland did demonstrate his bitterness toward Douglas so that partially remedied the credibilty problem.Garrison IS, however, getting it on with the first lady (played by Kim Bassinger who, like all of us, is not getting any younger.)Well, Garrison is framed as a potential presidential assasin, and Breckenridge goes after him with a vengeance. That's another credibility problem. No, aside from the sour grapes, I have little doubt that Breckenridge would have known better. Also, there is a ""subjective camera"" of someone taking pictures of Garrison and the first lady, and just Garrison alone, and... from a distance repeatedly throughout the film. But I'm still not sure who it is taking the pictures. Is it the culprit? The investigators? Both?There are characters whom the viewer may think are the culprits who are FBI agents. That was good...The guys that played the Eastern European ""terrorist"" did a pretty good job. One sounded like he was from Liverpool, but even that will do.Several times throughout the film, the dramatic music is blaring while the graphics on the screen are written messages, presented as a sort of collage. I suppose that was done for dramatic effect. But it were distracting, and I'm not sure particularly effective.As it turns out, there was a mole. One is kept wondering who that mole is, and that does make it a decent thriller. But there seemed to be a couple of loose ends untied. Like I'm a little confused as to the mole's role (no pun intended) relative to that of the first lady.Yeah, it was pretty good at keeping you a the edge of your seat. For that it's worth seeing. But the ""loose ends,"" designed, perhaps, to get you to see it again, are a little disconcerting. And as to other reviewers here--and others still--who've described it as ""predictable,"" I was reluctant at first to call it that. But now that I think of it, it was a little too ""they all lived happily ever after."" Sure, Garrison lost his job. But he was still the loved veteran...And one more item: I wish there had been a little more ""closure"" with the mole. One doesn't really know what happened to him.Well, again, it's a pretty good thriller. But don't expect artistic perfection.

998964,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000G5SILC,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","It was a kind of surprise that Hollywood still keeps making a political thriller about the criminals engineering a conspiracy to kill the VIPs, and a super-human agent who almost single-handedly fights it. Luckily `The Sentinel' is a reasonably entertaining if not original thriller, far better than other flops like `Shadow Conspiracy.' Director Clark Johnson (`S.W.A.T') keeps the ball rolling, and the pace is fast enough to make us forget the countless plot holes and implausible motives of the characters.Michael Douglas plays Pete Garrison, veteran secret service agent who once saved the life of President Ronald Reagan. After one of his colleagues gets killed, an informer reaches him, telling him that there is another assassination plan that is going on.Well, I can go on writing about the convoluted story, but maybe I shouldn't. There is an ex-best friend (and agent) played by Kiefer Sutherland in his `24' mood and he still wouldn't agree to bury the hatchet with Pete. There is a new recruit Eva Longoria in tailored suit who has not much to do in the story. Those who know something about the political thrillers can predict what will happen to each character, perhaps except one love affair involving the First Lady played by Kim Basinger, but that part looks sometimes out of place (partly because they altered the original book's story, which is more surprising).But the film itself is not bad. It keeps good pace, and the cast especially the lead Michael Douglas did a fine job. Usually I am not much interested in the assassination story - not because it is implausible, but too many films did that, didn't they? - but `The Sentinel' has a good rhythm that barely covers the impossibilities of the story.",3,"OK Thriller with Michael Douglas as Veteran Agent, and Kim Basinger as The First Lady",1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,1725,"['was', 'kind', 'surprise', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'making', 'political', 'thriller', 'criminals', 'engineering', 'conspiracy', 'kill', 'VIPs', 'super-human', 'agent', 'who', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'fights', 'Luckily', 'Sentinel', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'not', 'original', 'thriller', 'far', 'better', 'other', 'flops', 'Shadow', 'Conspiracy', 'Director', 'Clark', 'Johnson', 'S.W.A.T', 'ball', 'rolling', 'pace', 'fast', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', 'countless', 'plot', 'holes', 'implausible', 'motives', 'characters.Michael', 'Douglas', 'Pete', 'Garrison', 'veteran', 'secret', 'service', 'agent', 'who', 'once', 'saved', 'life', 'President', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'one', 'colleagues', 'killed', 'informer', 'telling', 'assassination', 'plan', 'going', 'on.Well', 'can', 'go', 'writing', 'convoluted', 'story', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'ex-best', 'friend', 'agent', 'played', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', '24', 'mood', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'agree', 'bury', 'hatchet', 'Pete', 'new', 'recruit', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'tailored', 'suit', 'who', 'not', 'much', 'do', 'story', 'who', 'know', 'something', 'political', 'thrillers', 'can', 'predict', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'character', 'perhaps', 'one', 'love', 'affair', 'involving', 'First', 'Lady', 'played', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'part', 'sometimes', 'place', 'partly', 'altered', 'original', 'book', 'story', 'more', 'surprising', '.But', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'good', 'pace', 'cast', 'especially', 'lead', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'Usually', 'am', 'not', 'much', 'interested', 'assassination', 'story', 'not', 'implausible', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'Sentinel', 'good', 'rhythm', 'barely', 'impossibilities', 'story']",N/A

998967,AP3B615GM191G,B000G5SILC,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","The opening scene of ""The Sentinel"", which shows the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, gives this movie a feeling of gravitas and importance.  Sadly, the direction and overall general production value of the experience fails to live up to that opening scene and instead produces little more than stock fare for this genre.For a basic plot summary, ""The Sentinel"" focuses on the Secret Service for the U.S. President (David Rasche).  When the head of the President's protection detail (Michael Douglas) is accused is being a mole, lead investigator Dave Breckenridge (Kiefer Sutherland) and his rookie partner (Eva Longoria) are called in to investigate.The simple reason this film was made was as a vehicle for the rising stars of Sutherland (who pretty much plays Jack Bauer of 24 in this film) and Longeria (sex symbol from Desperate Housewives trying to branch into more serious fare).  Douglas is thrown in for his personal background in political flicks.Thus, while there is most definitely enough ensemble acting talent to carry the movie, the story doesn't come anywhere near to supporting them.  The plot of ""The Sentinel"" is one that has been recycled time after time and adds nothing new into the mix.  The build-up is decent, but the execution leaves one wondering ""is that it...really?"".One bright spot, as usual, is the acting performance from Kiefer.  This genre suits him perfectly, and he could have been utilized even further (perhaps an interrogation scene?!).  Unfortunately, Douglas is only decent and Longoria isn't given much to do.  Perhaps, however, there just wasn't enough ""meat"" in the script to do anything with.Overall, then, ""The Sentinel"" is a stock political thriller and absolutely nothing more.  If you haven't seen many of these movies, this one will appeal to you.
