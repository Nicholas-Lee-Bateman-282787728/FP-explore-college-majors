1641200,A85KBTRAMBMG9,B00BYO8WU6,Rob S,"[0, 0]","I accidentally clicked on this title - but being open-minded I decided to watch it to see if it was worth the view.  That was likely the worst and most wasted 10 minutes of television I can remember.  I stopped counting how many times the word ""fashion"" was used (with enumerable descriptors attached - that somehow was supposed to give clarity and meaning their references).  I'm sure if I watched it through fruition, ""fashion"" would have been used to describe how a ""fashion director"" relieves themselves.  It was genuinely used to describe pretty much anything - which means the word in fact actually has no meaning.Pathetic, devoid of any substance and demonstrates (without any ambiguity) just how out of touch the arrogant, narcissistic and self-absorbed ""high-fashion"" crowd and industry as a whole really are (yes, that's a judgmental statement - but it is clearly accurate).  And yes, I easily came to that conclusion in less than 10 minutes of viewing - and I'm sure you would as well.But hey - maybe that's your 'thing'.",1,"Accidentally selected, watched for as long as I could stand - Absolute garbage.",1403049600,"06 18, 2014",2014,1032,"['accidentally', 'clicked', 'title', 'being', 'open-minded', 'decided', 'watch', 'see', 'was', 'worth', 'view', 'was', 'likely', 'worst', 'most', 'wasted', '10', 'minutes', 'television', 'can', 'remember', 'stopped', 'counting', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'word', 'fashion', 'was', 'used', 'enumerable', 'descriptors', 'attached', 'somehow', 'was', 'supposed', 'give', 'clarity', 'meaning', 'references', ""'m"", 'sure', 'watched', 'fruition', 'fashion', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'describe', 'how', 'fashion', 'director', 'was', 'genuinely', 'used', 'describe', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'word', 'fact', 'actually', 'meaning.Pathetic', 'devoid', 'substance', 'demonstrates', 'ambiguity', 'just', 'how', 'touch', 'arrogant', 'narcissistic', 'self-absorbed', 'high-fashion', 'crowd', 'industry', 'whole', 'really', 'are', 'yes', 'judgmental', 'statement', 'clearly', 'accurate', 'yes', 'easily', 'came', 'conclusion', 'less', '10', 'minutes', 'viewing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'well.But', 'hey', 'maybe', ""'thing""]",N/A
