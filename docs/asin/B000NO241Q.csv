The only thing I wish they had done with this is they could've put in games such as the game he got his 3000th hit, 400th home run, the 1991 All-Star game in which he was MVP, or even game 5 of 1983 World Series in the Orioles victory over Philly.",5,Ripken,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,311,"['Overall', 'solid', 'set', 'interesting', 'games', '90', 'only', 'thing', 'wish', 'had', 'done', 'could', ""'ve"", 'put', 'games', 'such', 'game', 'got', '3000th', 'hit', '400th', 'home', 'run', '1991', 'All-Star', 'game', 'was', 'MVP', 'even', 'game', '5', '1983', 'World', 'Series', 'Orioles', 'victory', 'Philly']",Baltimore Orioles Legends - Cal Ripken Jr.

But other than that, there isn't much worth watching more than once.  Maybe the three home-run game and the documentary.

Also the 2001 All-Star Game is a nice piece. The balance of the set is average at best.

But..there are so many classic moments that make this a MUST for any true baseball fan.The complete game where he eclipsed Lou Gehrig is wonderful and reminds me how I felt at the time and how Cal almost singlehandedly returned baseball back to prominence after the horrible strike.  The All star game is also terrific fun and the bonus disc with an hour documentary on Cal and multiple highlight clips from 3,000th hit to 400th homer etc etc is very cool.If I had a son I'd  want  him to watch this to understand what baseball is really about and  what class and  work ethic and grace are...",5,a great chunk of  classic baseball history and Cal's best moments!,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,982,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'nobody', 'reviewed', 'old', 'southern', 'californian', 'will', 'take', 'lead', 'millions', 'baseball', 'fans', 'Baltimore', 'let', 'rip.This', 'set', 'flab..whenever', 'have', 'complete', 'games', 'are', ""n't"", 'world', 'series', 'games', 'are', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'so', 'DVDs', 'Cal', 'multi-hit', 'affairs', 'are', ""n't"", 'something', 'will', 'revisit', 'too', 'often', 'But..there', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'classic', 'moments', 'make', 'MUST', 'true', 'baseball', 'fan.The', 'complete', 'game', 'where', 'eclipsed', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'wonderful', 'how', 'felt', 'time', 'how', 'Cal', 'almost', 'singlehandedly', 'returned', 'baseball', 'back', 'prominence', 'horrible', 'strike', 'All', 'star', 'game', 'also', 'terrific', 'fun', 'bonus', 'disc', 'hour', 'documentary', 'Cal', 'multiple', 'highlight', 'clips', '3,000th', 'hit', '400th', 'homer', 'etc', 'etc', 'very', 'cool.If', 'had', 'son', ""'d"", 'want', 'watch', 'understand', 'what', 'baseball', 'really', 'about', 'what', 'class', 'work', 'ethic', 'grace', 'are']",Baltimore Orioles Legends - Cal Ripken Jr.
