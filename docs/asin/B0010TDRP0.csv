Some great actors with Kirk ""Sticky Fingers"" Jones, Beautiful Jill Wagner, Nelson Lee, Neil Jackson and with guest star Bokeem Woodbine. I love the Hard Rock Theme Music even the ending rocked too. Some awesome vampirize effects as the same as Buffy & Angel... I'm so sick and tired that every time I get a great series they canceled it because they get down from the stupid ratings, I don't even know how to rate them not even know how to get the emails or phone numbers either... I'm so pissed off that they canceled it, even the writers are probably pissed too, I don't know why HBO wouldn't pick it up because it is Unrated with Blood & Gore, With Never-Before-Seen Footage Mostly Nudity (Beautiful Women I mean holy s**t like Bada Bing if you like The Sopranos). I love all vampire series like ""Moonlight"",  ""Dark Shadows The Revival"" but ""Blade The Series"" was the best if ever seen I just don't know why they never get enough time to unfold.. If they wanted to cancel it they should have gotten it with a bang instead of getting a cliffhanger!!!  At least finally Spike/New Line got all 12 Episodes Revamped with a GREAT Box Set and Artwork and will treasure them for ever..

Show was already going on the Spike Network, and I use the term Network very loosely with Spike, when I became aware of it.Knew nothing of it at the time, and was very surprised Goyer was adapting it for a weekly television run. It was nice surprise though. I wasn't much of a fan of Blade in the comic book, always came across as corny to me, but became a fan after it was adapted to the big screen with Wesley Snipes. Filled my action and drama quotos very nicely.Can't say that Sticky Fingers really compares to Snipes, or that this small screen take lives up to the big screen versions, but this was a nicely done and extremely well-written tv show. Filled with just enough action and tons of expense. Couldn't wait until the next shows I remember. The Trio of Blade/Krista/Chen worked seemlessly well together, with great Villians in lead villian Marcus/ young and old Charlotte/ undervalued Chase, plus FBI agent Collins to provide the human element I thought the feature films kind of lacked.I was only going to watch a few shows at a time, but ended up watching the entire series again in like 2 days. Finally got to see the two-part pilot, which was much better than others here say it was IMHO. Maybe we watched different ones, because I thought they were both good and set up the premise very nicely.Really wish ""Spike"" would have given this series a longer run. It's was by far the best thing they ever produced. I said at the time Spike would keep it since they only had so much wrestling and ultimate fighting they could show. Man was I wrong. Apparently Mixed-fighting re-runs are more lucrative than I thought. I digress though.This is/was a great series. Well worth a look for anyone still interested, or newly interested. Get the entire series though, and not just the House Of Chthon versions, which doesn't do the series true justice.",4,Underrated & Underappreciated,1308096000,"06 15, 2011",2011,1914,"['Finally', 'got', 'chance', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'entire', 'series', 'Show', 'was', 'already', 'going', 'Spike', 'Network', 'use', 'term', 'Network', 'very', 'loosely', 'Spike', 'when', 'became', 'aware', 'it.Knew', 'nothing', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'Goyer', 'was', 'adapting', 'weekly', 'television', 'run', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'fan', 'Blade', 'comic', 'book', 'always', 'came', 'corny', 'became', 'fan', 'was', 'adapted', 'big', 'screen', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Filled', 'action', 'drama', 'quotos', 'very', 'nicely.Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Sticky', 'Fingers', 'really', 'Snipes', 'small', 'screen', 'take', 'up', 'big', 'screen', 'versions', 'was', 'nicely', 'done', 'extremely', 'well-written', 'tv', 'show', 'Filled', 'just', 'enough', 'action', 'tons', 'expense', 'Could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'next', 'shows', 'remember', 'Trio', 'Blade/Krista/Chen', 'worked', 'seemlessly', 'well', 'together', 'great', 'Villians', 'lead', 'villian', 'Marcus/', 'young', 'old', 'Charlotte/', 'undervalued', 'Chase', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Collins', 'provide', 'human', 'element', 'thought', 'feature', 'films', 'kind', 'lacked.I', 'was', 'only', 'going', 'watch', 'few', 'shows', 'time', 'ended', 'up', 'watching', 'entire', 'series', 'again', '2', 'days', 'Finally', 'got', 'see', 'two-part', 'pilot', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'others', 'here', 'say', 'was', 'IMHO', 'Maybe', 'watched', 'different', 'ones', 'thought', 'were', 'good', 'set', 'up', 'premise', 'very', 'nicely.Really', 'wish', 'Spike', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'series', 'longer', 'run', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'produced', 'said', 'time', 'Spike', 'would', 'keep', 'only', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'wrestling', 'ultimate', 'fighting', 'could', 'show', 'Man', 'was', 'wrong', 'Apparently', 'Mixed-fighting', 're-runs', 'are', 'more', 'lucrative', 'thought', 'digress', 'though.This', 'great', 'series', 'Well', 'look', 'anyone', 'still', 'interested', 'newly', 'interested', 'Get', 'entire', 'series', 'not', 'just', 'House', 'Chthon', 'versions', ""n't"", 'do', 'series', 'true', 'justice']",Blade:Series (DVD)

Snipes looked always overacted and he felt like he was pushed to do something he did not like.  That said, I decided to give a try to the TV series after reading the reviews in Amazon.  For my surprise the TV series were extremely good, far better than expected.  I was stuck to my sit always wondering what was going to happen next.  The series are packed with a lot of action, some vampire romance and a lot of blood, not to mention that there were a couple of times when I jumped out of my sit because of the suspense and thrill.  I won't say the TV series were better than the trilogy movies but they could be as good as well and stand by themselves.  Mr Sticky Fingaz was a lot more convincing in the roll and he felt more linked to the rest of the cast specially Nelson Lee.  Marcus Van Sciver and Krista Starr are my favorite characters, but Charlotte and Chase are killing good too.  It's a pity that the series were canceled.  I wish they change their mind and decide to make a second season with the same cast.

Guess what, I was pleasantly shocked at the ability of this show to surpass the movies as a true drama. The movies were flash and action, the series is plot, subversion and mental stimulation. Blade is portrayed by rap star Sticky Fingaz and he does an adequate job as the cold, distant and brooding vampire hunter. But this show is more about the character portrayed by the lovely Jill Wagner. She starts as a quiet observer and becomes a backbone of this drama. Her determination and drive help bring guts to the storyline. As Krista, she wants only to uncover the truth of her brother's sudden and mysterious death, but you can say she bites off more than she can chew. Krista is turned after being nibbled by House of Chthon leader, Marcus Van Skyver. She painfully agrees to act as Blade's spy and infiltrates the organization that is Chthon. She bites and scratches her way towards the top, while battling the differences between her goals and those of Blade. The storyline is intricate, involved and detailed. We get a glimpse into Blade's childhood and adolescent years, the workings of the vampire hierarchy and the unknown wars between humans and vampires. This series was cut off after only one season and it's all here in this set, including uncut and never before seen footage. Bonus features are numerous and interesting. Well written, acted, directed and produced. This is excellent entertainment that won't disappoint. 5 STARS",5,Not your Mother's BLADE,1235520000,"02 25, 2009",2009,1548,"['Being', 'fan', 'Wesley', 'Snipe', 'Blade', 'movies', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'series', 'mild', 'replacement', 'Guess', 'what', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'shocked', 'ability', 'show', 'surpass', 'movies', 'true', 'drama', 'movies', 'were', 'flash', 'action', 'series', 'plot', 'subversion', 'mental', 'stimulation', 'Blade', 'portrayed', 'rap', 'star', 'Sticky', 'Fingaz', 'adequate', 'job', 'cold', 'distant', 'brooding', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'show', 'more', 'character', 'portrayed', 'lovely', 'Jill', 'Wagner', 'quiet', 'observer', 'backbone', 'drama', 'determination', 'drive', 'help', 'bring', 'guts', 'storyline', 'Krista', 'only', 'uncover', 'truth', 'brother', 'sudden', 'mysterious', 'death', 'can', 'say', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'Krista', 'turned', 'being', 'nibbled', 'House', 'Chthon', 'leader', 'Marcus', 'Van', 'Skyver', 'painfully', 'act', 'Blade', 'spy', 'organization', 'Chthon', 'way', 'top', 'battling', 'differences', 'goals', 'Blade', 'storyline', 'intricate', 'involved', 'detailed', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Blade', 'childhood', 'adolescent', 'years', 'workings', 'vampire', 'hierarchy', 'unknown', 'wars', 'humans', 'vampires', 'series', 'was', 'cut', 'off', 'only', 'one', 'season', 'here', 'set', 'including', 'uncut', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'footage', 'Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'numerous', 'interesting', 'Well', 'written', 'acted', 'directed', 'produced', 'excellent', 'entertainment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint', '5', 'STARS']",Blade:Series (DVD)

1126059,AHUHQKC55W48I,B0010TDRP0,David C. McMunn,"[0, 0]","Great mini series though, much like the Soprano's, the last episode leaves you hanging.  Krista (played by Actress Jill Wagner) portrays a U.S. Military Combat Medic returning home from war only to find her brother murdered under mysterious circumstances.  During her investigation she discovers her brother's murder was perpetrated by a Vampire named Marcus, the leader of the evil House of Chthon.  She joins forces with Blade (played by Kirk Jones) and his Asian Sidekick to bring down Marcus and his Coven, but there plans are soon thereafter discovered by Marcus...and Krista is subsequently murdered and then resurrected, as a Full-Fledged Vampire.  Kirk does an outstanding job in the title role, though Wagner and the rest of the supporting staff certainly hold their own in each of their respective roles.

I found the pilot to be only okay, but I decided to watch the series all the way through.  To my surprise it actually seemed to get better as the show went on.  There were a couple of self-contained sub plots which were wrapped up in the same episode but the main plots (there were more than one) ran through and each episode picked up exactly where the previous one left off.  Every episode (even the last one) had some sort of cliffhanger, and by the end I was disappointed that they didn't have more seasons.  With only a couple of exceptions, the most part the acting was very good.  A couple of plots were kind of flimsy, but overall it had a very solid set of plots with various individuals and factions competing with each other for their own interests.  At times it was predictable, but there were several surprises too (at least for me).  At times it seemed like it was a little too easy for people to get away with things, but that should be expected for something based on a comic book.

I generally hate movie to TV adaptations & this show didn't look to be any different.  It was with great reluctancy then that when given a copy of this box set that I actually checked it out.  The 1st couple episodes (AKA ""The House Of Chthon"" straight to video release)were pretty corny & the acting from pretty much the entire cast of likables was pretty horrendous.  You know what though, I realised that not only did I not hate it, but I was actually really intrigued to check out the next episode.  Sure enough, with every episode everything got better.  I even accepted ""Sticky Fingaz"" (remember him from the old 90's rap group Onyx? ""SLAM! Duh! Da! Da!"" :P) as a pretty good replacement for ol' Dr. Greenthumb Snipes.  You actually get alot more out of this than you would expect from a regular TV show.  In fact anything that you would find in a rated R movie, from cussing, f-bombs, nudity, blood, guts & gore, you'll find here too.  Not that any of that stuff is necassarily important (okay well the blood & gore kinda is with it being a vampire show & all), but it does go along way in making you feel right at home with the 3 other movies.  I'm not gonna lie & say that the effects and all are movie quality, but much better than most TV shows.  I have to say I think I actually like the series better than I liked the 3rd movie.  This is just one of those shows that completely sucks you in the more you watch of it.  I guarantee that if you watch just a couple episodes you'll be completely sucked in.  I really hope if enough people buy this set that maybe the show'll get picked up by another studio where it can get the recognition that it deserves cause this really is a great series worth watching.  This show would fit in perfectly on HBO or Showtime.  Not to mention the cliff hanger it ended with, all I gotta say is ""Newline, you better at least give us another movie to finish the story"".  Bottom line is that this is a show that I didn't expect, nor did I want to like but wound up being one of the better shows I've watched in a while.  I strongly recommend everyone that's ever even remotely been interested in Blade, vampires, or Sci-Fi even to check this series out, it's a buried treasure that deserves to be found.",5,Any Fan Of The Movies Will Love This Series!!!

1126070,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B0010TDRP0,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[15, 31]","After a pretty successful trilogy of films starring Wesley Snipes (the first really being the beginning of the whole comic to film adaptation craze), Blade made the transition to television on Spike TV, courtesy of the films' writer David Goyer and comic scribe Geoff Johns.  The series finds Blade (now portrayed by Kirk ""Sticky Fingaz"" Jones) and his partner Shen (Nelson Lee) coming to the aid of a Iraq War veteran (Jill Wagner, better known as the girl from the Mercury commercials) whose twin brother was a vampire familiar of powerful vamp Marcus Van Sciver(Neil Jackson), and was murdered because of something he knew.  All this leads to some revelations, flashbacks to Blade's past, and an inevitable showdown between Blade and Van Sciver; all of which really doesn't amount to much.  Don't get me wrong, there's a few moments of greatness to be found here, as Goyer attempts to weave a decent amount of the vampire world mythology he crafted in the very first film into the series' underbelly, but what really hurts Blade: The Series is Blade himself.  Kirk Jones looks the part, but his overacting and static dialogue delivery are more annoying than anything, and the same goes for a majority of the show's cast as well.  There's some solid amounts of nicely filmed action sequences, and hot women to boot (Wagner and the gorgeous Jessica Gower), but there just isn't enough here to make Blade: The Series worthwhile.  The series would end on a bit of a cliffhanger, as bad fan reaction and overall poor ratings would cause the show to get cancelled.  All in all, if you're a Blade fan, the series is worth a look if you missed it on TV, but otherwise, don't really bother.",2,Disappointing,1197936000,"12 18, 2007",2007,1684,"['pretty', 'successful', 'trilogy', 'films', 'starring', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'first', 'really', 'being', 'beginning', 'whole', 'comic', 'film', 'adaptation', 'craze', 'Blade', 'made', 'transition', 'television', 'Spike', 'TV', 'courtesy', 'films', 'writer', 'David', 'Goyer', 'comic', 'scribe', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'series', 'Blade', 'now', 'portrayed', 'Kirk', 'Sticky', 'Fingaz', 'Jones', 'partner', 'Shen', 'Nelson', 'Lee', 'coming', 'aid', 'Iraq', 'War', 'veteran', 'Jill', 'Wagner', 'better', 'known', 'girl', 'Mercury', 'commercials', 'twin', 'brother', 'was', 'vampire', 'familiar', 'powerful', 'vamp', 'Marcus', 'Van', 'Sciver', 'Neil', 'Jackson', 'was', 'murdered', 'something', 'knew', 'revelations', 'flashbacks', 'Blade', 'past', 'inevitable', 'showdown', 'Blade', 'Van', 'Sciver', 'really', ""n't"", 'amount', 'much', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'few', 'moments', 'greatness', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Goyer', 'weave', 'decent', 'amount', 'vampire', 'world', 'mythology', 'crafted', 'very', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'underbelly', 'what', 'really', 'Blade', 'Series', 'Blade', 'Kirk', 'Jones', 'part', 'overacting', 'static', 'dialogue', 'delivery', 'are', 'more', 'annoying', 'anything', 'same', 'majority', 'show', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'solid', 'amounts', 'nicely', 'filmed', 'action', 'sequences', 'hot', 'women', 'boot', 'Wagner', 'gorgeous', 'Jessica', 'Gower', 'there', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'here', 'make', 'Blade', 'Series', 'worthwhile', 'series', 'would', 'end', 'bit', 'cliffhanger', 'bad', 'fan', 'reaction', 'overall', 'poor', 'ratings', 'would', 'cause', 'show', 'get', 'cancelled', ""'re"", 'Blade', 'fan', 'series', 'look', 'missed', 'TV', 'otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother']",Blade:Series (DVD)
1126071,A11S26M1MUM7O7,B0010TDRP0,Neil Ford,"[1, 1]","One thing TV and movie producers have to take into account when making sequels or series is the ""meathead factor"". These viewers love anything that has fights and explosions and lots of rapid cutting; on the other hand, anything that doesn't include these things is BAD. If you try to follow a successful action movie with something that emphasises character, plot or mood over action, these fans will jump on you and kick the stuffing out of you. This makes TV adaptations especially risky, as the lower budget and longer timeframe mean you WILL be doing these unpopular things. This is why Blade the Series had low ratings and was cancelled. But there IS an audience for this series, who just weren't aware of the show at the time, due to its pure action image carrying over from the movies.Vampire fans, as opposed to action fans, really should seek this series out. They'll discover a great, involved story of feuding vampire clans (or ""houses""), conspiracies, double agents and dangerous relationships, supported by lots of interesting backstory for the various characters, and high quality production standards (I'd say this series looks better than the original movie, which admittedly had some weak CGI sequences). If these things appeal to you, you should definitely investigate this show, which gets deeper as it goes on. And there's still a high action quotient (high for TV, anyway), which IMO benefits from budget restrictions by looking more believable. Sensitive viewers should be warned there's some pretty nasty interpersonal violence towards the end of the series.I can't in good conscience give the series five stars, for the following reasons: (1) the fight sequence which opens the pilot movie has some overloud ADR grunts; (2) in the same pilot, the villain has to spout some rather clumsily-written exposition; (3) because the series was cancelled, the plot doesn't come to a proper conclusion (though I promise you won't be left saying ""What?!?"" at your TV); and (4) towards the end of the series, Blade himself seems to become a bit superfluous to the plot.  On the other hand, there is a great story about Blade's old street gang coming after him, which also explains his tattoos; in a later arc, we find out more about his boyhood, and meet his father (played by Shaft's Richard Roundtree!).I think the plot problems I've indicated could probably have been tidied up, if only the show had got a second season. I see Blade in this (imaginary) second season as more of a puppet-master, controlling various agents and moving between them, putting out fires. Talking of Blade, one thing I like about the TV portrayal is that he doesn't seem so much like he needs to be ""cool""; with Jones playing him, he's just Bad (in a good way).For comparison purposes, I would rank this series well above Moonlight and Blood Ties (two other little-known vampire shows), bearing in mind that Blade, unlike those shows, doesn't have a love story as its core. Blade's generally serious tone can't really be compared with True Blood or the Joss Whedon shows; Blade is grittier and grimmer all round. The vampire houses plot element was also employed in Kindred the Embraced, but that series, while innovative for its time, can't compete with any of the post-Buffy genre shows in terms of writing, acting and production.So, for vampire fans: 4.5 stars, rounded down to 4.(Or zero stars, if you only like ""teh awsum fites"" :) )(BTW, Blade fans might be interested to know there is also a Blade anime (with optional Japanese audio!). It's not brilliant (slow first ep; Blade's eyes & lips look weird) but okay if you are into this sort of thing.

Forget about Blade and his gadgets... there is a real vampire story behind it all !!! The Van Sciver and Starr Characters are very good built. Actually the series could have gone on without Blade himself (too drastic?).The story behind it reminded me of ""The Kindred"" or ""Ultraviolet"" (the British show) with vampire clans or families or ""houses"" struggling with each other for power and survival... with us caught in the middle as by-standers or simply victims.In the movies, the story around Blade is written to make him the hero or the most important figure, however here it is different. The story stands on its own, and makes Blade just another piece of the action.I thank the producers and urge them to take the iniciative again... keep the story, the characters.... discard Blade if you are afraid of the hardcore fans out there...

1126075,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0010TDRP0,Tim Janson,"[3, 4]","After getting mostly negative reviews from critics and most fans, Blade the Series ended after just 12 episodes.  New Line Home Entertainment is now bringing the complete series to fans in a four disc DVD set which includes the two-part pilot episode.  These episodes are extended and unrated so even if you saw them during their initial TV run, there will be new stuff to see.  More gore, profanity, as well as a bit of nudity.  Was the series really that bad?  Not really, there are actually some pretty good things to be found in the series.Set in Detroit (and as a native, it's so nice to see my city once again portrayed as being strewn with garbage and abandoned cars) Blade faces off against the House of Cthon, one of several houses or clans of vampires.  Leading the house of Chthon is Marcus Van Scriver (Neil Jackson) a rather dapper, gentlemanly vampire.  In the pilot episode, former soldier Krista Starr (Jill Wagner) returns home from the service but the homecoming is bittersweet.  Her brother is murdered and she intends to find out who killed him.  This leads Jill to the discovery that her brother was a lackey and wannabe vampire. Eventually murdered by Marcus for getting a little too curious.  Jill also discovers there's a new street drug called ""Ash"" made from dead vampires that gives normal humans the powers of a vampire for a couple of hours.Jill's investigations lead to her discovering the existence of vampires and meeting Blade.  She'll try to kill Marcus but is captured and bitten by Marcus.  Blade keeps her from turning full vamp by having her take the same drugs that he takes.  Jill works from the inside with Blade on the outside to bring down Marcus and the House of Chthon.Let's start with the good...the series does have a lot of action and it's certainly never boring.  The fight choreography is well done and Blade comes up with some very clever ways to kill the enemy vampires.  Jill Wagner, perhaps best known for her frequent Lincoln Mercury commercials, is quite good as Krista Starr.  She's more than just a pretty face.  I also really enjoyed Bill Mondy as Detective Boone, a dirty cop who eventually is turned into a vampire himself.  He's just wickedly fun to watch!  There's also a great rivalry between Krista and fellow female vamp, Chase (Jessica Gower) who becomes jealous of Marcus' attraction to Jill.Where Blade suffers is with the main character himself.  Wesley Snipes may not have the most range as an actor but compared to Sticky Fingaz he's Robert De Niro.  Sticky scowls his way through the entire series, hissing his lines and trying to be intimidating.  His dialog comes off as wooden and forced, partly because of the clich&eacute;d scripting and partly because of his own lack of skill as an actor.  Now for all that the directors and producers claims that they love Sticky, they seemed to realize his limitations.  Sticky is not onscreen all the time and you go through long stretches in each episode without seeing him.The other weakness of the series is making it all about Blade Vs. Marcus Van Scriver and his henchman.  I think I'd have preferred to see Blade traveling about, city-to-city, eliminating vampires along the way without him having a Lex Luthor-type archenemy.  It simplifies the series much too much.  The series had it's limitations but probably deserved a longer run.ExtrasNot a lot.  There is a solid documentary ""Turning Blade"" about the development of the show and the differences between the series and the films.  There are also two commentary tracks on the pilot episode, one from Director Peter O' Fallon and the other from writers David Goyer and Geoff Johns.",3,NEEDED A STRONG LEAD ACTOR,1213574400,"06 16, 2008",2008,3658,"['getting', 'mostly', 'negative', 'reviews', 'critics', 'most', 'fans', 'Blade', 'Series', 'ended', 'just', '12', 'episodes', 'New', 'Line', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'now', 'bringing', 'complete', 'series', 'fans', 'four', 'disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'two-part', 'pilot', 'episode', 'episodes', 'are', 'extended', 'unrated', 'so', 'even', 'saw', 'initial', 'TV', 'run', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'stuff', 'see', 'More', 'gore', 'profanity', 'as', 'well', 'bit', 'nudity', 'Was', 'series', 'really', 'bad', 'Not', 'really', 'are', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'things', 'be', 'found', 'series.Set', 'Detroit', 'native', 'so', 'nice', 'see', 'city', 'once', 'again', 'portrayed', 'being', 'strewn', 'garbage', 'abandoned', 'cars', 'Blade', 'off', 'House', 'Cthon', 'one', 'several', 'houses', 'clans', 'vampires', 'Leading', 'house', 'Chthon', 'Marcus', 'Van', 'Scriver', 'Neil', 'Jackson', 'rather', 'dapper', 'gentlemanly', 'vampire', 'pilot', 'episode', 'former', 'soldier', 'Krista', 'Starr', 'Jill', 'Wagner', 'home', 'service', 'homecoming', 'bittersweet', 'brother', 'murdered', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killed', 'Jill', 'discovery', 'brother', 'was', 'lackey', 'wannabe', 'vampire', 'Eventually', 'murdered', 'Marcus', 'getting', 'little', 'too', 'curious', 'Jill', 'also', 'new', 'street', 'drug', 'called', 'Ash', 'made', 'dead', 'vampires', 'normal', 'humans', 'powers', 'vampire', 'couple', 'hours.Jill', 'investigations', 'lead', 'discovering', 'existence', 'vampires', 'meeting', 'Blade', ""'ll"", 'try', 'kill', 'Marcus', 'captured', 'bitten', 'Marcus', 'Blade', 'turning', 'full', 'vamp', 'having', 'take', 'same', 'drugs', 'Jill', 'inside', 'Blade', 'outside', 'bring', 'down', 'Marcus', 'House', 'Chthon.Let', 'start', 'good', 'series', 'have', 'lot', 'action', 'certainly', 'never', 'boring', 'fight', 'choreography', 'well', 'done', 'Blade', 'up', 'very', 'clever', 'ways', 'kill', 'enemy', 'vampires', 'Jill', 'Wagner', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'frequent', 'Lincoln', 'Mercury', 'commercials', 'quite', 'good', 'Krista', 'Starr', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Bill', 'Mondy', 'Detective', 'Boone', 'dirty', 'cop', 'who', 'eventually', 'turned', 'vampire', 'just', 'wickedly', 'fun', 'watch', 'also', 'great', 'rivalry', 'Krista', 'fellow', 'female', 'vamp', 'Chase', 'Jessica', 'Gower', 'who', 'jealous', 'Marcus', 'attraction', 'Jill.Where', 'Blade', 'suffers', 'main', 'character', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'most', 'range', 'actor', 'compared', 'Sticky', 'Fingaz', 'Robert', 'De', 'Niro', 'Sticky', 'scowls', 'way', 'entire', 'series', 'hissing', 'lines', 'trying', 'be', 'intimidating', 'dialog', 'off', 'wooden', 'forced', 'partly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'scripting', 'partly', 'own', 'lack', 'skill', 'actor', 'Now', 'directors', 'producers', 'claims', 'love', 'Sticky', 'seemed', 'realize', 'limitations', 'Sticky', 'not', 'onscreen', 'time', 'go', 'long', 'stretches', 'episode', 'seeing', 'him.The', 'other', 'weakness', 'series', 'making', 'Blade', 'Vs.', 'Marcus', 'Van', 'Scriver', 'henchman', 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'Blade', 'traveling', 'about', 'city-to-city', 'eliminating', 'vampires', 'way', 'having', 'Lex', 'Luthor-type', 'archenemy', 'series', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'series', 'had', 'limitations', 'probably', 'deserved', 'longer', 'run.ExtrasNot', 'lot', 'solid', 'documentary', 'Turning', 'Blade', 'development', 'show', 'differences', 'series', 'films', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'pilot', 'episode', 'one', 'Director', 'Peter', 'O', 'Fallon', 'other', 'writers', 'David', 'Goyer', 'Geoff', 'Johns']",Blade:Series (DVD)
