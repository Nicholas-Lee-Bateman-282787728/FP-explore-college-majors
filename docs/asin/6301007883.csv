242555,AGEIT17HENDIS,6301007883,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 2]","The paragraphs below were used to review the book that this film is based on. Since the film very closely follows the story line of the book the comments there can, for the most part, stand here. I would only add that Jack Nicholson's role as ex- baseball player, hard guy, and hobo alkie Fran is probably more understated that the book character (and more understated for him, given some of his more in-your-face roles). Meryl Streep, well is Merlyn Streep, and plays the role of Helen, Fran's street companion/lover, to a tee (although she might be a tad bit more beautiful that your average woman rummy). The surprise treat is the secondary role played by raspy singer-songwriter Tom Waits as Fran's sidekick, Rudy. On reflection though, for those, like me, who know Waits' later musical, work his role should not be surprised. Who else lately could fill that kind of `lost soul' hobo role so naturally?William Kennedy is, at least in his Albany stories, my kind of writer. He writes about the trials and tribulations of the Irish diaspora as it penetrated the rough and tumble of American urban WASP-run society, for good or evil. I know those people, their follies and follibles,  like the back of my hand. Check. Kennedy writes, as here, about that pervasive hold that Catholicism has even on its most debased sons and daughters, saint and sinner alike. I know those characteristics all too well. Check. He writes about that place in class society where the working class meets the lumpen-proletariat-the thieves, grifters, drifters and conmen- the human dust. I know that place well, much better than I would ever let on. Check. He writes about the sorrows and dangers of the effects alcohol on working class families. I know that place too. Check. And so on. Oh, did I mention that he also, at some point, was an editor of some sort associated with the late Hunter S. Thompson down in Puerto Rico. I know that mad man's work well. CheckThe above, in a tangential way, gets you pretty much all you need to know about the why of reading this book (and other stories by Kennedy), except a little something about the plot line. Well, that is fairly simple.  Old time baseball star Fran and his erstwhile companion, a gifted singer, Helen are drunks working their way through the edges between skid row and respectability. And, mainly, losing to the lure of the bottle and to the hard, hard struggle that it takes just to get through the day when your options are limited. Put that task together with trying to survive in the jungles, with its endless twisted characters, of Great Depression (that other one in the 1930s) Albany, trying to figure out when life went wrong and trying to figure out why it all went wrong- while fighting a losing battle against society's expectations- and one's family's. This will provide enough dramatic tension to keep you interested.  Oh did I mention that Kennedy writes with verve, with an uncanny understanding of his characters (although only Fran and Helen get the full treatment here)  and with no holds barred, or punches pulled down there on cheap street. See, that is why Kennedy and Thompson connected in the literary world.  They KNOW the under side of life.

242556,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301007883,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","Despite strong performances by the entire cast, a pitch perfect depiction of a deteriorating city and a compelling story, there is something about `Ironweed' that just doesn't really work all that well.  One of my friends called it `awful' the other day, and I won't go that far, but the fact of the matter is that `Ironweed' misses its mark.The film centers around a vagabond with a troubled past living during The Great Depression.  He is a drunk and is bombarded with haunted recollections of his past (most notably the death of his son).  During the course of one Halloween, Francis (this vagabond) attempts to reunite with his family and settle old accounts.  At the same time he's trying to make a little money and keep up his relationship with fellow boozing vagabond Helen.  His troubled past continually gets in the way of his clarity as he relives poor decisions that have forced him into his life of solidarity and in a way he is struggling to come to terms with and move on from those said decisions.One of my main issues with this film is that fact that it doesn't seem to really have a complete handle on all it is trying to get across.  Despite the fact that it runs over two hours in length, it doesn't really say a whole lot in that time frame.  The exploration of Francis's past is done in flashbacks that reveal little details, but nothing truly concrete and the treatment of his familial reunion, while emotionally touching, feels out of place.  The films first twenty minutes or so (everything up until Meryl Streep starts singing) tends to drag on without really getting the audience absorbed or interested (""where is this going?"" was a question I kept asking myself) and despite the fact that we are almost immediately introduced to that weighty memory (his son's death) it isn't enough to draw me in at that particular moment.`Ironweed' just feels only halfway thought out.Despite feeling that more time was needed to truly `develop' this prose (well, not more time just time better used), all actors involved do an outstanding job in making this film feel authentic and believable.  Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors and truly one of the best actors who's ever lived, and he pulls out all the stops here while maintaining a sense of restraint which isn't always associated with him as an actor.  Tom Waits is also VERY convincing (who would have thought) as Francis's friend Rudy.  I really loved what Carroll Baker was able to accomplish with just a few short scenes (an essential character arc that surpassed the `Lifetime'ish handling of the scenes) but in the end it is Meryl Streep who really stole my every attention.  From her total deglam to her accent and complete physical transformation (down to the way she carried her body), Streep was utterly superb.She nailed it.In the end I can't say that `Ironweed' is a great film, but it is a very good `idea' with some striking performances that make it a film worth seeing at least once.",3,"It doesn't feel `whole', but it is worth seeing...",1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,2977,"['strong', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'depiction', 'deteriorating', 'city', 'compelling', 'story', 'something', 'Ironweed', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'well', 'One', 'friends', 'called', 'awful', 'other', 'day', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'fact', 'matter', 'Ironweed', 'mark.The', 'film', 'centers', 'vagabond', 'troubled', 'past', 'living', 'Great', 'Depression', 'drunk', 'bombarded', 'haunted', 'recollections', 'past', 'most', 'notably', 'death', 'son', 'course', 'one', 'Halloween', 'Francis', 'vagabond', 'reunite', 'family', 'settle', 'old', 'accounts', 'same', 'time', 'trying', 'make', 'little', 'money', 'keep', 'up', 'relationship', 'fellow', 'boozing', 'vagabond', 'Helen', 'troubled', 'past', 'continually', 'way', 'clarity', 'poor', 'decisions', 'have', 'forced', 'life', 'solidarity', 'way', 'struggling', 'come', 'terms', 'move', 'said', 'decisions.One', 'main', 'issues', 'film', 'fact', ""n't"", 'seem', 'really', 'have', 'complete', 'handle', 'trying', 'get', 'fact', 'two', 'hours', 'length', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'whole', 'lot', 'time', 'frame', 'exploration', 'Francis', 'past', 'done', 'flashbacks', 'reveal', 'little', 'details', 'nothing', 'truly', 'concrete', 'treatment', 'familial', 'reunion', 'emotionally', 'touching', 'place', 'films', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'everything', 'up', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'singing', 'drag', 'really', 'getting', 'audience', 'absorbed', 'interested', 'where', 'going', 'was', 'question', 'kept', 'asking', 'fact', 'are', 'almost', 'immediately', 'introduced', 'weighty', 'memory', 'son', 'death', ""n't"", 'enough', 'draw', 'particular', 'moment.', 'Ironweed', 'just', 'feels', 'only', 'halfway', 'thought', 'out.Despite', 'feeling', 'more', 'time', 'was', 'needed', 'truly', 'develop', 'prose', 'well', 'not', 'more', 'time', 'just', 'time', 'better', 'used', 'actors', 'involved', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'making', 'film', 'feel', 'authentic', 'believable', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'who', 'ever', 'lived', 'out', 'stops', 'here', 'maintaining', 'sense', 'restraint', ""n't"", 'always', 'associated', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'also', 'VERY', 'convincing', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Francis', 'friend', 'Rudy', 'really', 'loved', 'what', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'was', 'able', 'accomplish', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'scenes', 'essential', 'character', 'arc', 'surpassed', ""Lifetime'ish"", 'handling', 'scenes', 'end', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'who', 'really', 'stole', 'attention', 'total', 'deglam', 'accent', 'complete', 'physical', 'transformation', 'way', 'carried', 'body', 'Streep', 'was', 'utterly', 'superb.She', 'nailed', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Ironweed', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'idea', 'striking', 'performances', 'make', 'film', 'seeing', 'least', 'once']",Ironweed VHS

I can only figure that there were some legal problems preventing it's release.Based on the Bestselling novel by William Kennedy, it tells the story of hobo Francis Phelan upon his return to his hometown of Albany, NY during the Great Depression. (No, you'll find no spoilers here!)Excellent work by Jack Nicholson in the lead role (though some have complained that he looks too hefty to be a bum during the depression); an overlooked Oscar-worthy performance by Meryl Streep; and a poignant bit of acting by Tom Waits as a fellow bum. Great casting in the secondary roles as well including Fred Gwynne, Carroll Baker, Michael O'Keefe and many others. Look for a cameo of William Kennedy during Meryl Streep's singing of ""He's Me Pal""Authentically filmed on location in Albany during the chill of Autumn, Hector Babenco has done a wonderful job capturing the latter years of the Depression and transforming a great novel into a great film.ON THE DVD:While I stick by my 5 star review of the film. I can only give the DVD 1 star. I received my copy yesterday and found that it is not the aspect ratio of the theatrical release. (Thanks to all who brought this to my attention). I had hoped for remastered sound and picture and was disappointed to find it is no more than the VHS version tranferred to DVD. Lionsgate really screwed up. However it will have to serve until someone else makes a proper release of this great flick.Blu-Ray update 4-16-2013This is a no frills Blu-Ray disc; it contains no special features, commentaries or language selection. It is however in widescreen format, and though the picture quality is not up to par with many more famous older films that have been put into Hi-Res, it is still miles ahead of the horrid DVD transfer that Lionsgate put out awhile back. Also,the DTS soundtrack is MUCH better than previous versions.Given the relatively small following this film has, it is unlikely we'll see a better treatment than this in the near future.

242568,AD94D0QMN6A6G,6301007883,jblyn,"[2, 2]","In an interview about the time this movie was released, director Hector Babenco (who is Brazilian) was quoted as saying that IRONWEED was the first book he'd read in English from cover to cover. It's very apparent from the first frame all the way through that he is in total sync with the characters and the story they're in. And, no question, this is a GRIM movie: even the few joyful moments in it are undercut by the overall joylessness of Francis Phalen's life in Depression-era Albany, New York.Francis' personal demons haunt him in the form of phantoms from the past that pop up whenever they please; his sometime lover and partner-in-misery Helen deals with her own hauntings, and between the two of them is a bond that they hate and love all at once. Then there's Rudy, Francis' fellow bum who knows he's facing the end from terminal cancer but maintains a cheerful aspect all the same. It gives away nothing to say that the road each of them takes through their lives leads nowhere, but they live their lives knowing full well that they result from choices they made of their own free will. It's a stretch to say that you leave the movie (or the original book) with a sense of hope, but I for one left this story with a deep respect for all of the characters within.It's a shame it didn't do better at the box office, because this movie showcases two of the finest performances given by Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep, as Francis and Helen. These are both actors who, in the past, sometimes overwhelm the movies they're in by their own personal mannerisms that never let you forget it's THEM as the characters they portray, not the characters themselves. In IRONWEED, that doesn't happen; Nicholson particularly gives such dimension to Francis that you are totally with him AS Francis from start to finish, and Streep does the same as Helen. Strong supporting performances by Fred Gwynn, Carroll Baker and Tom Waits (as Rudy) give IRONWEED emotional heft.This is not a movie to see if you want a hopeful, positive wrap-up at the end, but it is one to see for skillful storytelling on every level.",5,Amazing,1302480000,"04 11, 2011",2011,2106,"['interview', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'director', 'Hector', 'Babenco', 'who', 'Brazilian', 'was', 'quoted', 'saying', 'IRONWEED', 'was', 'first', 'book', ""'d"", 'read', 'English', 'cover', 'cover', 'very', 'apparent', 'first', 'frame', 'way', 'total', 'sync', 'characters', 'story', ""'re"", 'question', 'GRIM', 'movie', 'even', 'few', 'joyful', 'moments', 'are', 'undercut', 'overall', 'joylessness', 'Francis', 'Phalen', 'life', 'Depression-era', 'Albany', 'New', 'York.Francis', 'personal', 'demons', 'haunt', 'form', 'phantoms', 'past', 'up', 'whenever', 'please', 'sometime', 'lover', 'partner-in-misery', 'Helen', 'deals', 'own', 'hauntings', 'two', 'bond', 'hate', 'love', 'once', 'Then', 'Rudy', 'Francis', 'fellow', 'bum', 'who', 'facing', 'end', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'cheerful', 'aspect', 'same', 'away', 'nothing', 'say', 'road', 'lives', 'nowhere', 'live', 'lives', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'result', 'choices', 'made', 'own', 'free', 'will', 'stretch', 'say', 'leave', 'movie', 'original', 'book', 'sense', 'hope', 'one', 'left', 'story', 'deep', 'respect', 'characters', 'within.It', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'movie', 'two', 'finest', 'performances', 'given', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Francis', 'Helen', 'are', 'actors', 'who', 'past', 'sometimes', 'overwhelm', 'movies', ""'re"", 'own', 'personal', 'mannerisms', 'never', 'let', 'forget', 'THEM', 'characters', 'portray', 'not', 'characters', 'IRONWEED', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Nicholson', 'particularly', 'such', 'dimension', 'Francis', 'are', 'totally', 'AS', 'Francis', 'start', 'finish', 'Streep', 'same', 'Helen', 'Strong', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Fred', 'Gwynn', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'Rudy', 'give', 'IRONWEED', 'emotional', 'heft.This', 'not', 'movie', 'see', 'want', 'hopeful', 'positive', 'wrap-up', 'end', 'one', 'see', 'skillful', 'storytelling', 'level']",Ironweed VHS

242572,A34D06JL7LC6MU,6301007883,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 3]","Ironweed is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by William Kennedy (who also wrote the script) and has long been out-of-print, only recently debuting on DVD.Besides Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep receiving Oscar nominations for their performances in 1987, Ironweed has never been talked about much. It doesn't make any ""Great Movies"" lists, it's not discussed in film circles, and it's seemingly just been forgotten. This is a tragedy, because Ironweed deserves to be considered a classic.The film opens in Albany, New York in 1938, with Francis Phelan (Nicholson) asleep on a street. Francis is a bum. He hasn't shaved or showered in a while, he sleeps wherever he has to with no permanent address, and he's constantly drunk. Francis takes odd jobs when he runs out of money, sometimes with fellow bum Rudy (Tom Waits) who has six months to live (""Doctor says I got cancer. First thing I ever got.""). While shoveling graves, Francis stops at the gravesite of his baby son Gerald for the first time. Gerald died when Francis dropped him. Unable to take the guilt, Francis left his wife and two other children...He's been gone 22 years. While at a soup kitchen, Francis runs into his lover Helen (Streep), also a drunk, once a singer. Frank Whaley co-stars as younger Francis.The look of the film is perfect. It does look like Depression-era New York from the costumes, to the art direction, to the cinematography. There are some subtle touches in keeping the film within its timeframe as well, such as when Helen enters a diner and on the radio there is a discussion about Orson Welles' famed ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast.It's very well-made, but the thing that really captured my attention was the acting...Actors tend to overact when playing drunks; Nicholson and Streep are flawless. Their performances are very subtle, low-key, and powerful. Nicholson has played some of the most beloved characters to ever grace the screen...His performance as Francis is no exception. Nicholson really taps into the psyche of his character here and, in doing so, gives one of his best performances. Streep is an actress who can seemingly play anything. Here, she is terrific. The scene where Helen sings to Francis (and the patrons) in the bar is a perfect example of how completely this woman can inhabit a role. At first I was wondering what place this scene had in the film. When the scene ends, it's rather heartbreaking.Tom Waits gives a very good performance, although I'm not sure how out of his element he is here.Besides the depth these three actors give to their characters, one of the greatest achievements in these performances are the way the actors make you fall in love with their characters.Ironweed is really a wonderful film, worthy of much more credit and praise than it ever received. It plays on your emotions the way few films can and it features two of the greatest living actors giving two of their greatest performances.A forgotten classic in every sense of the word, I doubt you'll forget it once you see it.GRADE: A",5,A Forgotten Classic,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,3039,"['Ironweed', 'based', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize-winning', 'novel', 'William', 'Kennedy', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'long', 'been', 'out-of-print', 'only', 'recently', 'debuting', 'DVD.Besides', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'receiving', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'performances', '1987', 'Ironweed', 'never', 'been', 'talked', 'much', ""n't"", 'make', 'Great', 'Movies', 'lists', 'not', 'discussed', 'film', 'circles', 'seemingly', 'just', 'been', 'forgotten', 'tragedy', 'Ironweed', 'be', 'considered', 'classic.The', 'film', 'Albany', 'New', 'York', '1938', 'Francis', 'Phelan', 'Nicholson', 'asleep', 'street', 'Francis', 'bum', ""n't"", 'shaved', 'showered', 'while', 'wherever', 'permanent', 'address', 'constantly', 'drunk', 'Francis', 'odd', 'jobs', 'when', 'money', 'sometimes', 'fellow', 'bum', 'Rudy', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'who', 'six', 'months', 'live', 'Doctor', 'got', 'cancer', 'First', 'thing', 'ever', 'got.', 'shoveling', 'graves', 'Francis', 'gravesite', 'baby', 'son', 'Gerald', 'first', 'time', 'Gerald', 'died', 'when', 'Francis', 'dropped', 'Unable', 'take', 'guilt', 'Francis', 'left', 'wife', 'two', 'other', 'children', 'been', 'gone', '22', 'years', 'soup', 'kitchen', 'Francis', 'lover', 'Helen', 'Streep', 'also', 'drunk', 'once', 'singer', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 'co-stars', 'younger', 'Francis.The', 'look', 'film', 'perfect', 'look', 'Depression-era', 'New', 'York', 'costumes', 'art', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'are', 'subtle', 'touches', 'keeping', 'film', 'timeframe', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'when', 'Helen', 'diner', 'radio', 'discussion', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'famed', 'War', 'Worlds', 'broadcast.It', 'very', 'well-made', 'thing', 'really', 'captured', 'attention', 'was', 'acting', 'Actors', 'tend', 'overact', 'when', 'playing', 'drunks', 'Nicholson', 'Streep', 'are', 'flawless', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'subtle', 'low-key', 'powerful', 'Nicholson', 'played', 'most', 'beloved', 'characters', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'performance', 'Francis', 'exception', 'Nicholson', 'really', 'psyche', 'character', 'here', 'doing', 'so', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Streep', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'seemingly', 'play', 'anything', 'Here', 'terrific', 'scene', 'where', 'Helen', 'Francis', 'patrons', 'bar', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'completely', 'woman', 'can', 'inhabit', 'role', 'first', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'place', 'scene', 'had', 'film', 'When', 'scene', 'rather', 'heartbreaking.Tom', 'Waits', 'very', 'good', 'performance', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'element', 'depth', 'three', 'actors', 'give', 'characters', 'one', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'performances', 'are', 'way', 'actors', 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'characters.Ironweed', 'really', 'wonderful', 'film', 'worthy', 'much', 'more', 'credit', 'praise', 'ever', 'received', 'emotions', 'way', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'two', 'greatest', 'living', 'actors', 'giving', 'two', 'greatest', 'performances.A', 'forgotten', 'classic', 'sense', 'word', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'forget', 'once', 'see', 'it.GRADE']",Ironweed VHS

I saw this ages ago, and it left just a vague impression.  Decided to order it and view again, as Nicholson is one of my favorites.  I could not sympathize with any of the characters in this movie.  The actors and actresses never seemed to drop into their roles at all.  The sets and backdrops were just too phony and ordinary, and the themes and places portrayed should have come across much more raw and gritty.  The acting was sub-par and the dialogue was contrived and predictable.  Nicholson couldn't even save this flick for me.  Streep acted like a paper sack in this one.  The recurring ghosts were just annoying and the family reunion scene made me ache is was so lousy.  If you wanna see a real drama about destitute and homeless people, get Barfly.  If you wanna see Nicholson is an unforgettable role, get The Last Detail, One Flew Over..., or even Goin' South.  Streep shined much brighter in Silkwood and Sophie's Choice.  This one was a mess.  Sorry-don't blow your $$$ on Ironweed.  Two stars are for some effective flashback sequenses and Streep singing in the bar (only scene in movie that moved me at all).  Notice when Nicholson, as a youth, hits the guy with whatever he threw during the strike.  The projectile never came close to hitting the guy, and the man who (supposedly) got struck covered his face and fell backwards before anything even got near him.

242580,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6301007883,Mr. Cairene,"[88, 91]","In highschool I came across a poem called The Projectionist's Nightmare, I don't recall the name of the poet but the poem's message is still very much with me. It described a wayward bird inside a movie theatre, where an  audience was watching two poeple &quot;being nice to each other&quot;. The  bird crashes into the screen, its blood slithering onto the image, the  spell is broken, the fantasy dispelled and the audience screams. Hector  Babenco had already made this poem in substance in 1985s Kiss Of A Spider  Woman where his lead character, a prisoner, escaped his miserable  surroundings through memories and fantasies of a propaganda film. Two years  later Bebanco would make Ironweed, and his lead character Frances Phelan  (Jack Nicholson) is well past the dreaming stage, the only fantasies he has  are of ghosts from his past.Ironweed is a film many people would find  slow. Nothing much happens and the characters don't change. The stark grim  atmosphere and the dead end conditions unrelenting. There is no hope in the  story of Frances Phelan. He has abandoned his family 22 years ago after  dropping his 13 year old baby to its death. The film starts with him  visiting his dead baby's grave for the first time, and then follows him  around as he joins his companion Helen Archer (Meryl Streep) and his friend  of sorts Rudy (Tom Waits). All three of them are alcoholics, and we watch  as they wade through the alleys of Albany 1938 looking for a place to sleep  . They get robbed, they see a homeless prostitute from Alaska die of cold  and they get into fights. But there is no emotional release in their anger  or in their better moments. You'd expect there to be emancipated joy when  Streep sings in a bar in front of a full house, or rage when a bunch of  kids rob them of all their money. But Streep is quickly back to her  depression, and Nicholson shrugs off the robbery. All the characters in  Ironweed are infact dead, they live off their memories, do what they have  to do to stay alive as they await their physical death. Meanwhile there are  quietly affecting scenes of closure as Nicholson visits his abandoned  family and Streep remember her &quot;musical days&quot;. Nicholson's and  Streep's Oscar nominated performance are among their best.Babenco  holds his camera on his characters for a long time, as if waiting for them  to crack. They never do because Ironweed is not angry, it doesn't have an  agenda, it is just mournful. As I watched it for the first time tonight I  became aware that the episodic cyclic nature of the film develops in the  end to a complete whole. When the end credits roll you feel like you were  standing too close to a painting, and now for the first time you are far  enough to see it for the sad beautiful image it is. The famed author John  Fowles said that we are all poets but few of us can write it. From the  rhetorical dialogue of these hobos, the ugly poverty they endure, the dark  allyways they inhabit and the ghosts that haunt them, Ironweed emerges as a  sad and deeply affecting poem.",4,To Comfort The Dead,964656000,"07 27, 2000",2000,3066,"['highschool', 'came', 'poem', 'called', 'Projectionist', 'Nightmare', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'name', 'poet', 'poem', 'message', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'described', 'wayward', 'bird', 'movie', 'theatre', 'where', 'audience', 'was', 'watching', 'two', 'poeple', 'quot', 'being', 'nice', 'other', 'quot', 'bird', 'crashes', 'screen', 'blood', 'slithering', 'image', 'spell', 'broken', 'fantasy', 'dispelled', 'audience', 'screams', 'Hector', 'Babenco', 'had', 'already', 'made', 'poem', 'substance', '1985s', 'Kiss', 'A', 'Spider', 'Woman', 'where', 'lead', 'character', 'prisoner', 'escaped', 'miserable', 'surroundings', 'memories', 'fantasies', 'propaganda', 'film', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'Bebanco', 'would', 'make', 'Ironweed', 'lead', 'character', 'Frances', 'Phelan', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'well', 'dreaming', 'stage', 'only', 'fantasies', 'are', 'ghosts', 'past.Ironweed', 'film', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'find', 'slow', 'Nothing', 'much', 'happens', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'stark', 'grim', 'atmosphere', 'dead', 'end', 'conditions', 'unrelenting', 'hope', 'story', 'Frances', 'Phelan', 'abandoned', 'family', '22', 'years', 'ago', 'dropping', '13', 'year', 'old', 'baby', 'death', 'film', 'visiting', 'dead', 'baby', 'grave', 'first', 'time', 'then', 'around', 'companion', 'Helen', 'Archer', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'friend', 'sorts', 'Rudy', 'Tom', 'Waits', 'three', 'are', 'alcoholics', 'watch', 'wade', 'alleys', 'Albany', '1938', 'looking', 'place', 'sleep', 'get', 'robbed', 'see', 'homeless', 'prostitute', 'Alaska', 'die', 'cold', 'get', 'fights', 'emotional', 'release', 'anger', 'better', 'moments', ""'d"", 'expect', 'be', 'emancipated', 'joy', 'when', 'Streep', 'sings', 'bar', 'front', 'full', 'house', 'rage', 'when', 'bunch', 'kids', 'rob', 'money', 'Streep', 'quickly', 'back', 'depression', 'Nicholson', 'shrugs', 'off', 'robbery', 'characters', 'Ironweed', 'are', 'infact', 'dead', 'live', 'off', 'memories', 'do', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'stay', 'alive', 'await', 'physical', 'death', 'Meanwhile', 'are', 'quietly', 'affecting', 'scenes', 'closure', 'Nicholson', 'abandoned', 'family', 'Streep', 'remember', 'quot', 'musical', 'days', 'quot', 'Nicholson', 'Streep', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'are', 'best.Babenco', 'camera', 'characters', 'long', 'time', 'waiting', 'crack', 'never', 'do', 'Ironweed', 'not', 'angry', ""n't"", 'have', 'agenda', 'just', 'mournful', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'tonight', 'became', 'aware', 'episodic', 'cyclic', 'nature', 'film', 'end', 'complete', 'whole', 'When', 'end', 'roll', 'feel', 'were', 'standing', 'too', 'close', 'painting', 'now', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'far', 'enough', 'see', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'image', 'famed', 'author', 'John', 'Fowles', 'said', 'are', 'poets', 'few', 'can', 'write', 'rhetorical', 'dialogue', 'hobos', 'ugly', 'poverty', 'endure', 'dark', 'inhabit', 'ghosts', 'haunt', 'Ironweed', 'sad', 'deeply', 'affecting', 'poem']",Ironweed VHS

After 20+ years, I thought I was watching a different film. It's amazing what the years can do to one's perspective. ""Ironweed"", Hector Babenco's first American film, based on William Kennedy's Pulitzer-winning novel, is certainly in the right hands; Babenco has a profound insight into the human condition, as it may apply. Slow and precise, the period of '38 Albany is perfectly presented. Mood and delivery is deliberate, and never fails to hit a nerve. Streep is first-rate, but it's Nicholson's film, a complete portrayal of a complex but incomplete man. His enigmatic character is a multi-layered  schitzo with demons at every turn. Watching this film again, without interruptions or distractions, is essential to its powerful effect. Acting from all is flawless, most notably from Jack and Meryl, but also from a very fine Tom Waits. It was good to see Carroll Baker again, too, in a tough role, handled with clarity and dignity.  Babenco, interpreting Kennedy's own script, hit a nerve that still resonates with me, days after seeing it again. Also, a fine score. I recommend all who've seen it before to give it another viewing. Make sure there are no distractions. There's real beauty in its bleak simplicity. Homeless people haven't changed that much, even after all these years. Timeless, indeed... My only complaint is that the DVD is in full screen (1.33:1) though the closing credits say that Panavision lenses were used; some of that exquisite period detail was lost.

242584,ACIJVXJWC1SJO,6301007883,R. Geatz,"[4, 4]","I have been eager for this film to be released on DVD for years, ever since I saw a clip of Meryl Streep singing ""He's Me Pal"" in the film when she was nominated for another Oscar for this role.  I was angry when I discovered that Lionsgate is only releasing a full-frame version, which I think is inexcusable in this age of HD wide-screen TVs.  But I reluctantly bought the substandard DVD for the chance to see Jack Nicholson and Streep in their Oscar-nominated performances.I'm glad I did, but this is an unrelentingly bleak and slow 2 1/2-hour film--and I generally like depressing movies!  Streep and Nicholson are great, as is the art direction and cinematography--another reason it deserved a wide-screen release.But it's possible that Ironweed the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was unfilmable. I got the book after watching the movie, and there's a scene from early in the movie when Francis Phelan (Jack Nicholson) visits the grave of the baby son whom he accidentally dropped and killed, which led him to abandon his family.  It's worth getting the book to read this passage alone, where Kennedy expresses the ""voice"" and aura this dead baby exudes over the cemetery.  It's amazing writing that can't really be translated visually, and I expect that's what's really wrong with the movie.  In the movie, Jack Nicholson kneels before a tombstone and talks, and the haunting effect of the baby can't really be conveyed.Francis is defined by his guilt and is haunted throughout the novel/movie by many ghosts,which are conveyed as interior monologues in the novel, and director Babenco takes the stereotypical movie approach and shows them as real hallucinations in white clothing and pale make-up. It really doesn't work.Little actually happens in the movie, and some crucial plot elements are treated almost as throw-away lines.  Francis, who has returned after 22 years, learns that his wife never told anyone that he dropped their baby.  That knowledge is powerful and could be transformative, but we don't witness Francis receiving the knowledge; he merely reports that someone told him.It turns out that one of the most powerful scenes in the movie is, indeed, the one of Helen (Meryl Streep), belting out ""He's Me Pal"" in a bar where her memory, fantasy and reality are intermingled with devastating results.  In that one scene, you learn who Helen was--and in her own mind remains--and who she has become.  This is another one of those chameleon performances by Streep, accent and all.  She actually has little material to work with, but she spins straw into gold and creates another one of those complicated women she has become known for. This is also where many of us first learned that she can sing.There is also another poignant scene where Streep goes to a music store and sits down to play a piano... beautifully. The scene is enriched when we see later that she was there to steal an LP, which she got to play on the portable victrola she had just gotten out of hock. Was she consciously preparing for her death?Aside from wonderful performances by Nicholson, Streep and Carol Baker as the abandoned wife, there is lots of over-the-top ""drunken bum"" acting by others. I can see why the film got its Oscar nominations, but I can also see why audiences stayed away in droves when it was released theatrically.",3,"Great performances, but maybe the novel was unfilmable",1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,3328,"['have', 'been', 'eager', 'film', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'years', 'ever', 'saw', 'clip', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'singing', 'Me', 'Pal', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'role', 'was', 'angry', 'when', 'discovered', 'Lionsgate', 'only', 'releasing', 'full-frame', 'version', 'think', 'inexcusable', 'age', 'HD', 'wide-screen', 'TVs', 'reluctantly', 'bought', 'substandard', 'DVD', 'chance', 'see', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Streep', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performances.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'unrelentingly', 'bleak', 'slow', '2', '1/2-hour', 'film', 'generally', 'depressing', 'movies', 'Streep', 'Nicholson', 'are', 'great', 'art', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'reason', 'deserved', 'wide-screen', 'release.But', 'possible', 'Ironweed', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize-winning', 'novel', 'was', 'unfilmable', 'got', 'book', 'watching', 'movie', 'scene', 'early', 'movie', 'when', 'Francis', 'Phelan', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'grave', 'baby', 'son', 'whom', 'accidentally', 'dropped', 'killed', 'led', 'abandon', 'family', 'worth', 'getting', 'book', 'read', 'passage', 'alone', 'where', 'Kennedy', 'voice', 'aura', 'dead', 'baby', 'exudes', 'cemetery', 'amazing', 'writing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'translated', 'visually', 'expect', 'what', 'really', 'wrong', 'movie', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'kneels', 'tombstone', 'talks', 'haunting', 'effect', 'baby', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'conveyed.Francis', 'defined', 'guilt', 'haunted', 'novel/movie', 'many', 'ghosts', 'are', 'conveyed', 'interior', 'monologues', 'novel', 'director', 'Babenco', 'stereotypical', 'movie', 'approach', 'real', 'hallucinations', 'white', 'clothing', 'pale', 'make-up', 'really', ""n't"", 'work.Little', 'actually', 'movie', 'crucial', 'plot', 'elements', 'are', 'treated', 'almost', 'throw-away', 'lines', 'Francis', 'who', 'returned', '22', 'years', 'wife', 'never', 'told', 'anyone', 'dropped', 'baby', 'knowledge', 'powerful', 'could', 'be', 'transformative', 'do', ""n't"", 'witness', 'Francis', 'receiving', 'knowledge', 'merely', 'someone', 'told', 'him.It', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'movie', 'indeed', 'one', 'Helen', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'belting', 'out', 'Me', 'Pal', 'bar', 'where', 'memory', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'are', 'intermingled', 'devastating', 'results', 'one', 'scene', 'learn', 'who', 'Helen', 'was', 'own', 'mind', 'who', 'become', 'one', 'chameleon', 'performances', 'Streep', 'accent', 'actually', 'little', 'material', 'work', 'straw', 'gold', 'one', 'complicated', 'women', 'become', 'known', 'also', 'where', 'many', 'first', 'learned', 'can', 'sing.There', 'also', 'poignant', 'scene', 'where', 'Streep', 'music', 'store', 'down', 'play', 'piano', 'beautifully', 'scene', 'enriched', 'when', 'see', 'later', 'was', 'there', 'steal', 'LP', 'got', 'play', 'portable', 'victrola', 'had', 'just', 'gotten', 'out', 'hock', 'Was', 'consciously', 'preparing', 'death', 'Aside', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Nicholson', 'Streep', 'Carol', 'Baker', 'abandoned', 'wife', 'lots', 'over-the-top', 'drunken', 'bum', 'acting', 'others', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'why', 'audiences', 'stayed', 'away', 'droves', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically']",Ironweed VHS

[Brad even commented that it looked like a copy of the old VHS pan-and-scan tape].August '09 EDIT:  Butch Johnson, a projectionist, gave the film a 3 star rating (on Feb. 27, 2009); he commented that this film was originally filmed in a fullscreen (1.33 : 1) aspect ratio, and ""cropped"" on the top and bottom for commercial ""widescreen"" theatrical distribution.  Comparing this fullscreen version with the widescreen version (which can be seen on youtube in installments, numbered: 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) Mr. Johnson's claim appears quite valid.  Consequently, although there's certainly something to be said for a film that fills our widescreen television screens, this DVD does not appear to be a pan-and-scan; it actually lets us see more of the ""original"" film, in--paradoxically--a smaller ""blackboxed"" 4X3 area.UPDATE APRIL 2013:  Hosanna! The Bluray widescreen (1:77:1) version of this film is vastly superior to the previously released fullscreen version.  As mentioned in my two previous paragraphs, the top and the bottom of this newer version have been trimmed, but the film is now available the way the director intended, and it packs a much stronger wallop.  The video quality of the bluray version is greatly improved, and it makes for a considerably richer movie experience.

It is about the same quality as you would get on a crt tv.
