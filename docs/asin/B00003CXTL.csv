Hollywood may not have it within it to make a realistic movie. Days of thunder certainly isn't realistic to the racing.If you are going to get any enjoyment at all from this film you are going to have to go in with an open mind. That this is a movie and will have movie racing, movie plots and movie attitudes.If you can go in with an open mind then you may find it a fun film, it deals more with the relationships than with racing in many ways. Sly is quite good and was enjoyable to watch.I loved the racing through city streets was alot of fun. The worst thing was the crashes.

That, it definitely is not. More of Stallone's story filtered through in Rocky. Here, I have the impression that half of the story was jettisoned for ""slowing down the action.""For there is plenty of action. The speed and horror of crashing are well communicated, as is - strangely enough - the simple thrill of racing. Harlin does a good job with the action sequences, making the moment of impact truly impressive. Racing relies so much on instinct rather than preplanned thought; the pit crew and support staff can only prepare and plan so much - the race still revolves around the driver. Racing is an old sport, and any tried-and-true fans who rent or buy this film hoping accurate, down-to-the-nub details will be disappointed. Harlin and Stallone take plenty of dramatic license. The famous chase through the streets of Chicago? Come on. While obviously something like that would never happen, I understand that Harlin and Stallone were trying to communicate the rage of a rejected young man in a unique and forceful manner. I can allow for that; but the chase went on far too long, almost as though it were enjoying the spectacle for its own sake. Don't say you weren't warned.Still, in between the racing montages and the overly-loud boom-boom music, there are some good parts. Robert Sean Leonard of ""House"" fame turns a really great performance. Stallone is strangely given little to do - the story of his character, Joe Tanto, is truncated, giving the impression that is where a lot of cutting happened so the film focuses more on Jimmy Bly (a suitably intense Kip Pardue). This is unfortunate, because I speculate that it is Tanto's back-story that is the real catalyst for the final climatic race. Certain elements of the story felt forced as a result. Our introduction to Joe Tanto happens with little warning or preamble, and exactly why Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds) thought Tanto could help the situation is never clearly stated. Stallone is perfectly cast as the old veteran with a few good races left in him; but , save for the ending, all his character does is dispense advice throughout the film. We see his impact on others, but never really see the impact of events on him.And this is ultimately what drags Driven down: is it about Bly (Pardue) or Tanto (Stallone)? They assembled some good young acting talent, had Stallone ready to play the embattled-but-charming man of wisdom, had Burt Reynolds ready to chew up any scenery he was given. What was 'wrong' in the '80s for Stallone was 'right' for this movie: if it was more about his character, Joe Tanto, his relationship with Carl Henry (Reynolds), and the changes Tanto had to make to help a younger driver and allow himself to get back a little dignity, suddenly you'd have a pretty good film on your hands. Instead, what we have is an assemblage of racing montages with fragments of a story in between - a real wasted opportunity.",2,There's a Good Film in Here Somewhere...,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,3038,"['can', 'be', 'hard', 'find', 'sometimes', 'remember', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'theaters', 'friends', 'called', 'Rocky', 'wheels', 'definitely', 'not', 'More', 'Stallone', 'story', 'filtered', 'Rocky', 'Here', 'have', 'impression', 'half', 'story', 'was', 'jettisoned', 'slowing', 'down', 'action', 'plenty', 'action', 'speed', 'horror', 'crashing', 'are', 'well', 'communicated', 'strangely', 'simple', 'thrill', 'racing', 'Harlin', 'good', 'job', 'action', 'sequences', 'making', 'moment', 'impact', 'truly', 'impressive', 'Racing', 'relies', 'so', 'much', 'instinct', 'rather', 'preplanned', 'thought', 'pit', 'crew', 'support', 'staff', 'can', 'only', 'prepare', 'plan', 'so', 'much', 'race', 'still', 'driver', 'Racing', 'old', 'sport', 'tried-and-true', 'fans', 'who', 'rent', 'buy', 'film', 'hoping', 'accurate', 'down-to-the-nub', 'details', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Harlin', 'Stallone', 'take', 'plenty', 'dramatic', 'license', 'famous', 'chase', 'streets', 'Chicago', 'Come', 'obviously', 'something', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'understand', 'Harlin', 'Stallone', 'were', 'trying', 'communicate', 'rage', 'rejected', 'young', 'man', 'unique', 'forceful', 'manner', 'can', 'allow', 'chase', 'went', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'almost', 'were', 'enjoying', 'spectacle', 'own', 'sake', 'Do', ""n't"", 'say', 'were', ""n't"", 'warned.Still', 'racing', 'montages', 'overly-loud', 'boom-boom', 'music', 'are', 'good', 'parts', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'House', 'fame', 'really', 'great', 'performance', 'Stallone', 'strangely', 'given', 'little', 'do', 'story', 'character', 'Joe', 'Tanto', 'truncated', 'giving', 'impression', 'where', 'lot', 'cutting', 'happened', 'so', 'film', 'more', 'Jimmy', 'Bly', 'suitably', 'intense', 'Kip', 'Pardue', 'unfortunate', 'speculate', 'Tanto', 'back-story', 'real', 'catalyst', 'final', 'climatic', 'race', 'Certain', 'elements', 'story', 'felt', 'forced', 'result', 'introduction', 'Joe', 'Tanto', 'little', 'warning', 'preamble', 'exactly', 'why', 'Carl', 'Henry', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'thought', 'Tanto', 'could', 'help', 'situation', 'never', 'clearly', 'stated', 'Stallone', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'old', 'veteran', 'few', 'good', 'races', 'left', 'save', 'ending', 'character', 'dispense', 'advice', 'film', 'see', 'impact', 'others', 'never', 'really', 'see', 'impact', 'events', 'him.And', 'ultimately', 'what', 'Driven', 'down', 'Bly', 'Pardue', 'Tanto', 'Stallone', 'assembled', 'good', 'young', 'acting', 'talent', 'had', 'Stallone', 'ready', 'play', 'embattled-but-charming', 'man', 'wisdom', 'had', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'ready', 'chew', 'up', 'scenery', 'was', 'given', 'What', 'was', ""'wrong"", ""'80s"", 'Stallone', 'was', ""'right"", 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'character', 'Joe', 'Tanto', 'relationship', 'Carl', 'Henry', 'Reynolds', 'changes', 'Tanto', 'had', 'make', 'help', 'younger', 'driver', 'allow', 'get', 'back', 'little', 'dignity', 'suddenly', ""'d"", 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'hands', 'Instead', 'what', 'have', 'assemblage', 'racing', 'montages', 'fragments', 'story', 'real', 'wasted', 'opportunity']",Driven VHS

(yes, I know this is CART/Formula 1) The plot was a rehash of well...a dozen other movies and some of the dialog was forced, corny and uncomfortable...much like Michael Scott from the Office.  If you can get past the plot and average acting then you're left with the racing action.  While I'll admit some of the special effects were gripping I couldn't enjoy them because they were so unrealistic.  As many others have pointed out the type of fuel used doesn't burn yellow it burns clean and blue.  There is NO way that downtown race could or WOULD ever have happened.  Oh and back to the plot.  Are we really expected to believe only two people were capable of winning from week to week AND that Carl (Burt Reynolds) was ready to fire a kid who WON FIVE RACES in his rookie season?  You have got to be kidding me!  You can win the darn championship with only one win!  It's about the points (at least in NASCAR it is.)  Anyway, the movie was just bad, bad, bad...I wish it wasn't.

I'm also glad that Kip Pardue has disappeared from film, since his presence was an ink stain on anything he graced.  He is just so dull.  This flick doesn't do him any favors.  Sure, the racing sequences are exciting, but they are all so overdone and glossy that they lose their edge and become preposterous eye-soars.  The remainder of the cast is also a mess.  Estella Warren makes a pretty bland romantic interest.  She's cute enough, but she's also ridiculously dull.  Sylvester Stallone has never been `talented' in this area, and he doesn't bring any of the glimmers of promise he mustered out of that overrated 1976 boxing flick.  Instead, he grumbles through this film as if he was merely tolerating it.  The only shimmer of light comes from a predictably catty Gina Gershon who is always a delight, regardless of the fact that she can't seem to play more than one shade of character.  In the end, this tiresome bore is far from worth the price of admission.  This is easily one of the worst films 2001 had to offer, and that's saying a lot considering that the year also birthed such travesties as `Glitter', `Jurassic Park III', `Swordfish' and `The One'.",1,Drive me off the cliff...,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,1252,"[""'m"", 'glad', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'found', 'movie', 'ridiculously', 'boring', 'ill-paced', ""'m"", 'also', 'glad', 'Kip', 'Pardue', 'disappeared', 'film', 'presence', 'was', 'ink', 'stain', 'anything', 'graced', 'just', 'so', 'dull', 'flick', ""n't"", 'do', 'favors', 'Sure', 'racing', 'sequences', 'are', 'exciting', 'are', 'so', 'overdone', 'glossy', 'lose', 'edge', 'become', 'preposterous', 'eye-soars', 'remainder', 'cast', 'also', 'mess', 'Estella', 'Warren', 'pretty', 'bland', 'romantic', 'interest', 'cute', 'enough', 'also', 'ridiculously', 'dull', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'never', 'been', 'talented', 'area', ""n't"", 'bring', 'glimmers', 'promise', 'mustered', 'overrated', '1976', 'boxing', 'flick', 'Instead', 'film', 'was', 'merely', 'tolerating', 'only', 'shimmer', 'light', 'predictably', 'catty', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'who', 'always', 'delight', 'regardless', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'play', 'more', 'one', 'shade', 'character', 'end', 'tiresome', 'bore', 'far', 'price', 'admission', 'easily', 'one', 'worst', 'films', '2001', 'had', 'offer', 'saying', 'lot', 'considering', 'year', 'also', 'birthed', 'such', 'travesties', 'Glitter', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'III', 'Swordfish', 'One']",Driven VHS

The technology oftentimes takes a secondary role to scenes which makes racing look like a demolition derby at the county fair.After seeing the film, top CART driver, Cristiano da Matta, joked that his car was always involved in spectacular wrecks.

Sly also wrote the screenplay for this latest Renny Harlin flick, and as usual his running theme is that of humanity overcoming the need for competitive gain. Though his dialogue needs (and I mean needs) a lot of help, the relationships between characters in the film are much stronger than you would expect. Stallone plays an over-the-hill race car driver who quit years ago when it just got too tough, who finds himself back in the game when he's asked to mentor the new boy in town (Kip Pardue). Pardue has his own troubles, mostly those of trying to beat his racing nemesis (Til Schweiger) and maybe steal the guy's girlfriend (Olympic-medalist swimmer Estella Warren, who in all fairness can act quite measurably). The film really comes alive when Gina Gershon is on the scene; I honestly don't think any film should ever be made without her (watch the part when she wipes up the floor with Stacy Edwards and her mousy little face-it's my favourite!!)

I was virtually Reciting the lines that hadn't even been Said yet, but I Didn't See ""Driven"" for Ground-breaking Dialogue or Oscar-worthy Performances. I saw it for High Powered Car Races, Fast pace Thrills and to See Sylvester Stallone Back on Top. I got Everything I was Expecting.Sly plays Joe Tanto, a Washed-up Formula One racer who is brought back by his friend Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds) to Befriend and Help out his Troubled Hotshot Driver Jimmy Blu (Kip Pardue), who is Talented, Fast and Professional, but he's also Reckless, Young and in a bit of a Slump. He has lost the Love of racing because of all the Pressure that is on him to Win. His Manager Brother (Robert Sean Leonard) and his On-Off Girlfriend (Estella Warren) don't help his Stress Factor. Sly believes if Jimmy pulls together Off the track, he'll come together On it, so Sly has to Earn Jimmy's Trust and remind him why he began racing in the First place, for the Love of the Race. Yep, that about Sum's it all Up.The Best Scenes include a Wild Joyride involving Two Prototype Formula One Cars and Downtown Chicago, a Car Flying through the air in Super Slow Motion, and of course, the Final Race. While a lot of the film concentrates on the Behind the Scenes stuff Formula One fans don't See, (like Handling the Pressure, how Easy it is for your Racing Career to Slip away, Relationships) Race fans are Still Treated to some of the Best Formula One Racing Ever captured on Camera, the Crashes, the Casualties, the Fear, the Sound... My god, the Sound.The Sound is actually the most Memorable part of the film, both the Sound Effects and the Soundtrack are Mind-blowing. Renny Harlin Obviously knows how to use Music, and Every Race has a Different song that suits the Mood, even some of the Dialogue fits the scenes. (eg.

Sylvester Stallone, although not quite in top form here, gives an above average performance as a has been, apparantly washed-up racer, who ends up coaching and mentoring an up and coming young star racer. Burt Reynolds also gives a fine performance as an injured former racer, who at first has a hard time coming to terms with Stallone's attempted comeback onto the racing circuit, but agrees to be an advisor of sorts to Sly's character. This movie provides many action-packed, fast paced scenes throughout various parts.

537629,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00003CXTL,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[1, 1]","""Driven"" wanted to be two films at once: it wanted to be a self-enlightened human movie and it wanted to be an extreme, stylized racing film.  It hardly succeeded on being either.  The dramatic portions are a cliched joke, the races themselves are riddled with bad CG effects and weird camera shots, and in fact trying to juggle these two aspects only left the film with a state of misshapen identity.  I doubt the pitch of 'Rocky on Wheels' actually worked in the long run, since he's not really the focus of the entire film anyway.The story is about Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardue), a rising driver with mental constants that limited him from pushing to the edge, so a wheelchair-bound Burt Reynolds hired his former driver/ally Joe Tonto (Stallone) to be Bly's advisor.  Being the mentor, he helped Bly with driving assistance as well as making hammy speeches about finding one's true passion; that might've worked in ""Rocky Balboa"", but the speeches don't work here.  While on his path to win the championship, Bly also got involved in a goofy love triangle between his thick-accented racing rival Beau, played byThat One Basterd, and the rival's fiance Sophia.  It got way too personal with itself that the story is actually corny.Even if the movie's selling point are the races themselves, the races are also poorly-done due to questionable directions.  During the races, the movie had perspective shots like cameras suddenly zooming into racer's faces, 360 degrees shots of the cars, first-person view with 'blur effects' and they're all poorly implemented; I do, however, like that behind-the-shoulder perspective on the drivers. The special effects involved in these races are obvious, and the crashes are so ridiculous, they make the speedway disaster from ""The Final Destination"" look realistic. It had a crash when the car's tires flew up in close-up slow-motion and they land towards the bleachers, but more absurd is that one big crash where a car flew in the air, get knocked by several cars, jump around, explodes, and then the gas leak lit the car in flames; I know the hardcore F1/Indy fans would point out the film's other inaccuracies that I didn't notice, but I know the latter crash is more suited for a ""Burnout"" game.Renny Harlin tries to make an action film out of racing, and they look phony as a result. But those crash scenes are nothing compared to what I think has one of the dumbest chase sequences in movie history: Tonto and Bly riding on indy cars towards a busy traffic. First off, the indy cars have incredibly horse power and massive speed, and Tonto was going after Bly when there's lots of cars and civilians on the path, not to mention lots of turns. These two couldn't maintain such a hectic speed without making head-on collisions with vehicles, walls, or running over people; they should've crashed the second they got on the road. Nevermind how cheap the car effects look, how this even began is impractical. Bly got involved in a complicated romantic situation and in rage goes full throttle; he's putting countless lives and property in danger because he's being selfish, and he didn't think of venting his frustrations at home or ride dangerously on an empty track?  EvenSpeed Racerroad rage on an empty track, and that's even more zanier than this movie. It's unrealistic, silly, and unnecessary.Sometimes, ""Driven"" can be either moodless or nauseating.  The nausea occurs when there's not any races going on, since the film still tried to be stylistic by adding jump cuts and scene fades during public interviews and crowd shots; I know they're suppose to convey a sense of anxiety, but they're so frequent they became dizzying.  Besides the absurd touches added to the races, the races on their own are nothing special.  I didn't care about the characters, the song choices are uneven raging from a Fatboy Slim track to a sappy love ballad, and the movie just tried way too hard to be edgy.

The plot though it's not important deals with Stallone who is retired.  He comes back because Burt Reynolds wants him to work with a new driver played by Kip Pardue.  Kip is confused and he is starting to do badly in his races.  His brother who manages him is pulling him in an opposite direction that he wants to go.  He wants to beat Til Schweiger in a race.  Kip ends up falling for Til's estranged girlfriend played by Estella Warren.  Estella is cute in her first screen role.  There's even a scene where she's in a pool and uses techniques she learned while being on the Canadian Swim Team (from real life).  Stallone ends up taking the place of Kip's driving partner who is now married to his bitter ex-wife played by Gina Gershon.  Got that?  No problem if you don't.  The first half an hour, I had no clue what was going on plot wise.  But soon, it all fits together even if I was able to predict plot turns a mile ahead.

First the plot is lame. It's pretty much a remake of Days of Thunder.  (I kept looking for Tom Cruise.)  You know, young hot shot gets help from crusty older man. Young hot shot meets girl, young hot shot gets girl. (Oh excuse me, Stalone's character gets girl, since he wrote the movie & is the star.)Stalone sniffed around Formula I for a season and they refused his offer to make a movie.  Initially, I was disapointed, but now I see they made the right decision.  Then he hung around Cart for a year.  Obviously, he was too busy playing the celeb to really pay attention to the sport.Besides, the plot that's been done before, let me tell you technically what's wrong with the movie.1.  A lot of the in-car shots are sped up. You really don't need that in these cars, they're quite exciting enough, thank you.2.  You see flames from fires when cars crash. Cart/Champ cars burn methanol, it burns clear, you don't see flames.3.  I remember at least 2 crashes where cars end up in water. I can't remember when I've seen a crash in Champ, Cart or Formula 1 where anyone has ended up in the water!!!!4.  Oh, and while the cars are in the water, they're on fire.  I've already mentioned that you can't see methanol when it burns and do you know how you put out a methanol fire?  With water!!!5.  Plus the crashes themselves are just too over the top. About once a year you'll get a crash where a car will fly through the air like these seem to have done every time.If you want a good race movie go get a VHS copy of Gran Prix or Le Mans. (I don't think they have been put out on DVD yet. Too bad.) Or if you want some lighthearted car action, then get Days of Thunder or Gumball Rally.

While actual ABC/ESPN auto racing announcers are featured, they do not call the film's races ANYWHERE close to reality; I realize things for a film are scripted, but the passion simply is not there.

However, it turns out thatthis movie was more unrealistic than my worst fears had considered.  For example, in one seen, the movies two protagonists start their race cars, and go racing around on city streats at top speed.  I suppose that Stallone forgot that Indy Cars do not have their own starters, they must be started with an external starter.  Nothing about the racing and wrecking is realistic, despite the fact that Sylvester Stallone was seen at several races in the year prior to this movies release.When you combine the unrealistic nature of the movie, with the complete lack of plot, and the poor acting, this movie doesn't even deserve a full star.",1,The Worst Movie Ever?,1006300800,"11 21, 2001",2001,796,"['fan', 'auto', 'racing', 'particularly', 'CART', 'F1', 'had', 'been', 'cautiously', 'anticipating', 'release', 'movie', 'DVD', 'time', 'However', 'out', 'thatthis', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'unrealistic', 'worst', 'fears', 'had', 'considered', 'example', 'one', 'seen', 'movies', 'two', 'protagonists', 'start', 'race', 'cars', 'go', 'racing', 'around', 'city', 'streats', 'top', 'speed', 'suppose', 'Stallone', 'forgot', 'Indy', 'Cars', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'own', 'starters', 'must', 'be', 'started', 'external', 'starter', 'Nothing', 'racing', 'wrecking', 'realistic', 'fact', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'was', 'seen', 'several', 'races', 'year', 'prior', 'movies', 'release.When', 'combine', 'unrealistic', 'nature', 'movie', 'complete', 'lack', 'plot', 'poor', 'acting', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'deserve', 'full', 'star']",Driven VHS

537652,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B00003CXTL,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[0, 0]","Driven is a conundrum. It starts out as a movie with little action, it's slow as it gets going. Stallone tries hard in his writing of the screenplay to establish characters that are familiar with each other, have past history together, and in some cases, have conflicts. This is good. But it gets tedious and his talent as a writer seems to have severly waned since his efforts on Rocky. Then the movie moves into a more racing action orientation, this is good too, but the character development is kind of left behind. Director Renny Harlin is notorious for sacrificing character subject matter in favor of action scenes. As expected, the racing scenes in this movie are energetic and powerful at most times, but they feel fake in some ways. The computer enhanced bullet speed, Matrix-like, crash scenes are very impressive, making you catch every angle of the disaster, a true rubber neckers dream. If you pick apart this movie you can find flaw after flaw. But watching it from beginning to end without any kind of judgment can be hard. Some of the flaws stand out so much it's impossible not to notice. But at the end you do get the feeling you were entertained for the most part. A better movie like this would be Days of Thunder, although not a great movie either. True racing fans will either love Driven or hate it. The traveling scenarios that these racers take up as they move from country to country, racing in one competition after another shows how grueling these racing tours can be on the drivers and the people that do it with them. I give this movie three stars because I believe it had great potential to be better. Unfortunately, I would only recommend buying this movie if you are a true racing fan of the CART series. Otherwise, you may be disappointed with its cumbersome treatment of the characters and over played crash scenes.",3,Not great...but not bad,998784000,"08 26, 2001",2001,1851,"['Driven', 'conundrum', 'out', 'movie', 'little', 'action', 'slow', 'going', 'Stallone', 'hard', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'establish', 'characters', 'are', 'familiar', 'other', 'have', 'past', 'history', 'together', 'cases', 'have', 'conflicts', 'good', 'tedious', 'talent', 'writer', 'have', 'severly', 'waned', 'efforts', 'Rocky', 'Then', 'movie', 'more', 'racing', 'action', 'orientation', 'good', 'too', 'character', 'development', 'kind', 'left', 'behind', 'Director', 'Renny', 'Harlin', 'notorious', 'sacrificing', 'character', 'subject', 'matter', 'favor', 'action', 'scenes', 'expected', 'racing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'energetic', 'powerful', 'most', 'times', 'feel', 'fake', 'ways', 'computer', 'enhanced', 'bullet', 'speed', 'Matrix-like', 'crash', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'impressive', 'making', 'catch', 'angle', 'disaster', 'true', 'rubber', 'neckers', 'dream', 'pick', 'apart', 'movie', 'can', 'find', 'flaw', 'flaw', 'watching', 'beginning', 'end', 'kind', 'judgment', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'flaws', 'stand', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'impossible', 'not', 'notice', 'end', 'do', 'get', 'feeling', 'were', 'entertained', 'most', 'part', 'better', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'True', 'racing', 'fans', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'Driven', 'hate', 'traveling', 'scenarios', 'racers', 'take', 'up', 'move', 'country', 'country', 'racing', 'one', 'competition', 'how', 'grueling', 'racing', 'tours', 'can', 'be', 'drivers', 'people', 'do', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'believe', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'be', 'better', 'Unfortunately', 'would', 'only', 'recommend', 'buying', 'movie', 'are', 'true', 'racing', 'fan', 'CART', 'series', 'Otherwise', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'cumbersome', 'treatment', 'characters', 'played', 'crash', 'scenes']",Driven VHS

In the meantime the current world champion, Beau Brandenbourg (Til Schweiger), upset by his recent defeats, breaks in a very mean way with his gorgeous girlfriend Sophia (Estella Warren).In significant second roles we can also see Gina Gershon as Tanto's ex-wife, Christian de la Fuente as her new husband and Robert Sean Leonard (later to become famous as Wilson in ""House, M.D"") as Bly's older brother.The film tells the story of World Series races but also of tensions and conflicts between people mentioned above.Although it can certainly not be considered as a masterpiece or even a major film, I was suprised by the amount of ""flak"" this movie received (and keeps receiving) on every conceivable web page I could find. Me personally, I rather liked it and I found some moments very endearing - especially the ending. I also found that Henry, Tanto and Brandebourg were all pretty interesting characters.I was also very impressed by the scene in which Estella Warren (who, before being an actress, used to be an olympic level swimmer) gives to her boyfriend (lucky little ba..ard!) a personal show of synchronic natation - and a little bit more. And frankly, I never imagined, that a girl can say ""Ribbit, ribbit"" in such a sexy way...For me the great quality of this film was its ""feel good"" character - when the credits started to roll, I felt pretty relaxed and I was smiling. OK, may be it was a silly smile, but still - I spend a nice moment watching it. And I found the races very interesting and pretty dramatic and finally I am quite happy that I was unable to notice what was wrong with them.It is a nice, soothing, gentle, relaxing, a little bit silly but quite entertaining film, very much adapted to watch with your wife or girlfriend.

I've been waiting for another film to be made on the world of auto racing, utilizing the technology we have today to add some incredible special effects into the film. Over a decade has passed since Days of Thunder, so how did they do this time with Indy Cars? Very well. As far as the actual basis for the film's plot, it doesn't draw quite as well as Days of Thunder's did. But the acting by both Kip Pardue and Til Schweiger, and the way the plot was acted out and presented really made the film have an unexpected impact. While neither Sly or Burt could come close to matching Robert Duvall, their performances were respectable and didn't lack much. The special effects, while a little much at times in terms of reality, were still awesome and presented very well. The filming techniques such as slo-mo and POV shots were used perfectly, and in extremely good form. As far as the DVD is concerned, the Picture and Sound quality are exceptional and the Extra's are all there, from director commentary to deleted scenes with Sly's commentary. Impressive enough to get me to go out and buy the DVD after renting it, so it's certainly worth a viewing.

Not only that, but we are also subjected to very little raw racing footage and more of the same badly done CGI that makes about half the film resemble a Playstation game, right down to the false tension and generic aggro-rawk blasted loudly in the background.

537672,A9JA0MI0GFQ39,B00003CXTL,Mike Blaszczak,"[1, 1]","Driven is about CART, the open-wheel racing series. I race myself; I'm just a weekend warrior who pulls their own car behind their truck. I have lots of fun, but I don't have a huge budget, like Sylvester Stallone had. So I don't screw-up quite as much as he did.This movie was surprising in that the story was much better than I had expected. The tale is of three drivers and a couple of owners. One driver is very young and unstable, seemingly challenged more by fitting in with his new surroundings and the expectations placed upon him than by working the car. Sly plays an older driver, a veteran who might be past his prime but is still capable of winning a few races. And there's another driver in the middle--comfortable with racing in the series, but experiencing profound self-doubt in light of a few recent setbacks.The interaction between the three is what makes the plot. The caracters, on the surface, have balance and could make a great and rich storyline. But there's lots of missing pieces between them, their interaction, and their development.In the automotive press, particularly in the racing world, the making of this movie received a tremendous amount of ink. That press worked a lot of hype into the movie's most critical audience--race drivers. We read about how Bernie Ecclestone, czar of F1, discontinued a long relationship with Sly after many months of involvement. CART picked up the relationship, but I think that was a mistake.Racing films are hard to make. It's impossible to concisely capture the passion, precision, and effort put forth by everyone involved in race day. But the blunders in this movie made it nearly unbearable.That a driver would leave a Champ car during a race and be the first one to assist a wrecked driver, that cars fly 80 feet into the air after a wreck, that raindrops are visible as you drive at 130 miles an hour ... all of the those faults quickly add up to distractions that kept me from enjoying the show. Drivers hum and sing and yell in their cars, but they don't do it with their radio mic key pressed. Drivers don't suddenly decide that they'll go a little harder and pass everyone in sight during the next lap.Even though it could have been better developed, I was surprised at the strength of the story but I was profoundly disappointed in the visual aspects of the movie. I know that Stallone did lots of work to get footage, including using his relationship with CART to get access to pit row during live races, and offering many popular drivers cameos.

In that context, I watched the movie again. Sly's script is actually pretty good. He was writing it in the mindset of Joe Tanto, writing it as a former mega-celebrity who has to deal with the fact that he's not as hot a commodity as he used to be, and has to make way for the new talent. It's very open and very frank, and just plain great. Unfortunately, this great material fell into the hands of Renny Harlin, a director who isn't known for his dramatic depth, nor his subtlety.

537681,A2GHZVX5RY6DTC,B00003CXTL,"""sadistik""","[4, 9]","Just caught a pre-screening of this on my campus, and I'll be damned if this isn't one of the worst things I've seen in a while. Stallone wrote the script, but far be it from the glory of Rocky. Remember Stallone, a big budget does not a good movie make. Awful, awful, awful. I want to sue Stallone for two hours of my life that I lost watching this. Stallone actually had a decent idea for a sports movie. Instead of the young rookie, old-timer who helps him out, and the villainous arch-rival common in sports movies, we get interesting variations on these basic characters. The rookie is the typical hotshot type, but the interesting ones COULD have been Stallone and the arch rival. Stallones character is an old-timer called back to help the rookie, but feels disrespected by the owner played by Burt Reynolds (Is it just me or does reynolds have more makeup on than Gina Gershon?). He has this desire to win, though this is dropped as the story prgresses, avoiding a potentially interesting plot. The rival is a German hotshot champion who is an incredibly insecure and sensitive guy behind his tough exterior. This character is much more original than most sports movie baddies, but his character is pushed to the side in favor of chintzy (and laughably bad) FX and dialogue. The story devolves quickly into a &quot;Beautiful People Doing Dangerous Things&quot; type flick and SUCKS. If Stallone had taken the idea of three different people all with different reasons for trying to win he could have made an interesting movie about the trials of competition and the tolls it takes on those competing. Ineptitude abounds though, and the cheese is so thick I felt my arteries clogging. It's filmed like a bad soap opera and written like an even worse one.Oh and for those who will go anyway for the &quot;cool crashes&quot;,the crashes are all computer generated and look like they were created using Atari.",1,Oh wow....more big budget dreck....,988070400,"04 24, 2001",2001,1912,"['Just', 'caught', 'pre-screening', 'campus', ""'ll"", 'be', 'damned', ""n't"", 'one', 'worst', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'Stallone', 'wrote', 'script', 'far', 'be', 'glory', 'Rocky', 'Remember', 'Stallone', 'big', 'budget', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'make', 'Awful', 'awful', 'awful', 'want', 'sue', 'Stallone', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'lost', 'watching', 'Stallone', 'actually', 'had', 'decent', 'idea', 'sports', 'movie', 'Instead', 'young', 'rookie', 'old-timer', 'who', 'out', 'villainous', 'arch-rival', 'common', 'sports', 'movies', 'get', 'interesting', 'variations', 'basic', 'characters', 'rookie', 'typical', 'hotshot', 'type', 'interesting', 'ones', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'Stallone', 'arch', 'rival', 'Stallones', 'character', 'old-timer', 'called', 'back', 'help', 'rookie', 'feels', 'disrespected', 'owner', 'played', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'just', 'reynolds', 'have', 'more', 'makeup', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'desire', 'win', 'dropped', 'story', 'prgresses', 'avoiding', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'plot', 'rival', 'German', 'hotshot', 'champion', 'who', 'incredibly', 'insecure', 'sensitive', 'guy', 'tough', 'exterior', 'character', 'much', 'more', 'original', 'most', 'sports', 'movie', 'baddies', 'character', 'pushed', 'side', 'favor', 'chintzy', 'laughably', 'bad', 'FX', 'dialogue', 'story', 'quickly', 'quot', 'Beautiful', 'People', 'Doing', 'Dangerous', 'Things', 'quot', 'flick', 'SUCKS', 'Stallone', 'had', 'taken', 'idea', 'three', 'different', 'people', 'different', 'reasons', 'trying', 'win', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'interesting', 'movie', 'trials', 'competition', 'tolls', 'competing', 'Ineptitude', 'cheese', 'so', 'thick', 'felt', 'arteries', 'clogging', 'filmed', 'bad', 'soap', 'opera', 'written', 'even', 'worse', 'one.Oh', 'who', 'will', 'go', 'anyway', 'quot', 'cool', 'crashes', 'quot', 'crashes', 'are', 'computer', 'generated', 'look', 'were', 'created', 'using', 'Atari']",Driven VHS
537682,A2RN2AO4BE6F4K,B00003CXTL,"Scott Bright ""scottypotty""","[1, 3]","Movie Summary: Joe Tanto is a retired and washed up Grand Prix champion with a colorful past. He is called back into the racing game by the man who tossed him out years before. Joe is needed to help a young could be champion named Jimmy Bly. Jimmy is on the verge of throwing everything away just like Joe did. Joe has a hard time getting close to Jimmy because of Jimmy's manger brother who restricts all access to Jimmy. Eventually Joe and Jimmy become friends. Joe helps Jimmy find out what he is really made of. In the process Joe finds out what he is made of as well.My Opinion: This is a mildly entertaining story about auto racing and a men finding themselves. The plot of the feature presentation has some holes. We aren't told what happens to Joe or the Luc the reporter. This plot line is just dropped. The deleted scenes contained on this DVD edition fill out this plot line and a couple of others as well. They are interesting to watch because you get to see the evolution of the film. It was a complete story and the editors cut things out for whatever reasons and made it less than a complete story. The racing scenes are fun and it's hard no to root for Jimmy Bly. The acting isn't that great although Stallone does come off as likeable. Overall, this is a mediocre film with a decent DVD release.DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1 Very sharp and clear video. Sound: DD5.1  Extras:  There are a lot of extras on this DVD. The biggest one for me was the deleted and extended scenes. Most of them are just extended scenes with not much extra information. The deleted scenes however do as Mr. Stallone says in his commentary. They fill out the story. You get to see plot lines finished and questions answered. Other extras include the trailers, documentaries, and a commentary by the director.  Menus: The menus were ok. Nothing special.What You Should Do:  Rent this one if you like racing or Sylvester Stallone. It's not one of his best efforts, but it is entertaining. The deleted scenes show how they can cut a story up so that it becomes confusing and unfulfilling. It is also worth a rental for Estella Warren.Related Movies To Check Out: Days of Thunder, Top Gun, Death Race 2000",3,Winning is an Attitude,1001980800,"10 2, 2001",2001,2212,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'Joe', 'Tanto', 'retired', 'washed', 'up', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'champion', 'colorful', 'past', 'called', 'back', 'racing', 'game', 'man', 'who', 'tossed', 'out', 'years', 'Joe', 'needed', 'help', 'young', 'could', 'be', 'champion', 'named', 'Jimmy', 'Bly', 'Jimmy', 'verge', 'throwing', 'everything', 'away', 'just', 'Joe', 'did', 'Joe', 'hard', 'time', 'getting', 'close', 'Jimmy', 'Jimmy', 'manger', 'brother', 'who', 'access', 'Jimmy', 'Eventually', 'Joe', 'Jimmy', 'become', 'friends', 'Joe', 'Jimmy', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'made', 'process', 'Joe', 'out', 'what', 'made', 'well.My', 'Opinion', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'story', 'auto', 'racing', 'men', 'finding', 'plot', 'feature', 'presentation', 'holes', 'are', ""n't"", 'told', 'what', 'Joe', 'Luc', 'reporter', 'plot', 'line', 'just', 'dropped', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'contained', 'DVD', 'edition', 'fill', 'plot', 'line', 'couple', 'others', 'well', 'are', 'interesting', 'watch', 'get', 'see', 'evolution', 'film', 'was', 'complete', 'story', 'editors', 'cut', 'things', 'out', 'reasons', 'made', 'less', 'complete', 'story', 'racing', 'scenes', 'are', 'fun', 'hard', 'root', 'Jimmy', 'Bly', 'acting', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'Stallone', 'come', 'off', 'likeable', 'Overall', 'mediocre', 'film', 'decent', 'DVD', 'release.DVD', 'Quality', 'Video', 'Widescreen', 'Anamorphic', '2.35:1', 'Very', 'sharp', 'clear', 'video', 'Sound', 'DD5.1', 'Extras', 'are', 'lot', 'extras', 'DVD', 'biggest', 'one', 'was', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'Most', 'are', 'just', 'extended', 'scenes', 'not', 'much', 'extra', 'information', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'however', 'do', 'Mr.', 'Stallone', 'commentary', 'fill', 'out', 'story', 'get', 'see', 'plot', 'lines', 'finished', 'questions', 'answered', 'Other', 'extras', 'include', 'trailers', 'documentaries', 'commentary', 'director', 'menus', 'were', 'ok', 'Nothing', 'Should', 'Do', 'Rent', 'one', 'like', 'racing', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'efforts', 'entertaining', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'show', 'how', 'can', 'cut', 'story', 'up', 'so', 'confusing', 'unfulfilling', 'also', 'worth', 'rental', 'Estella', 'Warren.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Out', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Death', 'Race', '2000']",Driven VHS

Still, this second Sylvester Stallone-Renny Harlin collaboration is fairly enjoyable on a junk-food-cinema level. The racing sequences are exciting (despite some obvious digital effects) and, surprisingly, Stallone's character takes a back seat to the young leads. However, one wishes Stallone had written a screenplay that wasn't a ""Rocky"" retread - right down to casting Burt Reynolds in the Burgess Meredith role. As a result, ""Driven"" covers the same narrative ground that you've seen in previous Stallone efforts.

537684,A11SZO8JCMAJGH,B00003CXTL,"""seccho""","[8, 8]","When one considers that in the last ten years Harlin and Stallone have either directed/acted in such films as Judge Dredd, Daylight, Assassins, Demolition Man, Get Carter, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger(cooperatively), and Deep Blue Sea, it's almost surprising this movie isn't worse than it is.  It's bad, for sure, and if all goes well I will never see it again in my life, but I've seen worse.But the very fact that I've seen worse did nothing to negate the way I felt after watching this film.  And on that note I will attempt to review the film.  Instead of creating an organized, developed review, I will simply cover some points I thought about as I watched the movie.Although I know little about racing, I do know that you don't have to win every race of the season to be considered an excellent driver.  In the film it seems that every time the rookie Bly fails to finish first in a race it's like he's really blown it for himself.  And I do realize that Reynold's character is obsessed with winning, but seriously, even a second place season finish for a rookie in a major racing league would be a significant accomplishment.  And like I've said already, I don't know much about racing, but I do know that Formula 1 cars have steering wheel mounted gear shifters.  How Formula 1 differs or is related to CART I do not know, but I would be interested to find out.  After all, I would think that a stick shift would provide more of a dramatic effect(probably has something to do with the fallic undertones).Another thing about the movie that annoyed me was how predictable it was.  I knew from the moment that Sylvestor's character met the reporter &quot;Luke&quot; that they would get something going between them...the very instant.  Also, you know that one of the main characters is going to be injured or killed, and through the process of elimination it's not long before one realizes who it's going to be.  Also, even though the racing season is 20 races long, you know that it's all going to come down to the last race, and in all probability, the very last moments of the last race.  The movie doesn't fail in following these classic cleches.There were also other problems I had with the movie.  The night driving in the race cars through the city streets of &quot;Chicago&quot; was a joke, right?  Aside from everything else that was wrong with that segment the one thing I kept thinking about was, &quot;how can they see to drive with no helmets on&quot;.  I mean, their eyes are going to dry out.  The design of the car is probably going to deflect a certain amount of air away from the cockpit, but at near 200mph speeds, you're probably still going to need some sort of visor protecting your eyes.  Also, I had to chuckle at the mid-race rescue of Memo.  Talk about some seriously contrived bologna.  Not to mention the pragmatic ridiculousness of it all.  And as far as the between race drama goes, you could eliminate all of it and still not lose any emotional affect from the film.  As for the races themselves...Harlin relies on choppy editing and pumped up music to convey excitement.  The computer effects aren't terrible, but there are many instances when you are very, very aware that it's cgi your seeing.Ultimately, this film substitutes cleches for character development and plot, has dialogue that is only adequate at its best moments, and rarely fulfills in its capacity as an action film.

537685,A30A5I8FG82M2E,B00003CXTL,SpookyChick,"[3, 4]","This movie, as released, is a feather-weight entertainment.  Light on involving drama, high on digitally-enhanced racing sequences.  Nowhere near the best of Sly Stallone's career, but certainly better than most of the stuff he did in the '90s; like 'Specialist', 'Assassins', 'Judge Dredd'.On many DVDs, the 'deleted scenes' are often of very little interest-  you can usually tell why they ended up cut.  That is NOT the case with &quot;Driven&quot;.  The lengthy program of deleted/extended sequences gives us an idea of what Stallone's original script was like.  Character's become fleshed out, plot holes and inconsistencies are rectified.  The DRAMA of the film was clearly sacrificed for MORE ACTION.  Yes, the racing scenes are important to the movie, but this clearly was at one time a more emotionally involving movie.This deleted scene selection can also be viewed with Stallone's running commentary.  It is very clear from listening to Mr. Stallone discuss these cut scenes that there was a lot of thought put into the script.  After watching this, it is clearly incorrect to place the blame for &quot;Driven&quot;'s weaknessess on Sly.  The final product is a far cry from his original vision.It is a shame that the editor was allowed to chop so much vitality out of this movie.  Long ago, Stallone won an Oscar nomination for his screenplay to &quot;Rocky&quot;.  I wish the movie he actually wrote had made it to theaters.  This is a great example of the DVD format allowing us a glimpse into the filmmaking process.  At least Stallone was able to prove himself capable of thoughtful expression to those who doubted him.One final thought on the extensive deleted/expanded scene segment...  These scenes are presented in their 'rough form', as Stallone explains.  There is no music or special effects added.  The sound has yet to be properly mixed.  Nevertheless, the real heart and soul of the movie can be found in these 'rough' scenes.  They pack more emotional punch than all the loud music and digital effects of the final product.Give this film a chance.  Spend some time with the supplemental materials on the DVD.

There are rivalries between drivers, people who go 'way back' and therefore 'owe each other something', ticked off ex-wives, the pain of old failures still remembered, and the pressure to perform more today than yesterday.  Typical racing movie drama junk.  Of course, you are also treated to lots of crash scenes with stuff flying around, junk landing on spectators, things bursting into flames, and even a car that flys off and somehow ends up landing in a pond.  Like I said, typical racing movie blather.The thing that elevates Driven above all of that is that, with all of it's cheesiness, it is still entertaining.  If you like special effects you will love this movie.  There are some really great computer generated effects that include: showing how the cars crash together, some decent tunnel vision stuff from the POV of the driver, and a really cool effect that shows the rain drops hitting the drivers visor and being pushed off by air currents.  There is also an extra on the DVD of a particular scene that was cut, which included a car blowing up completely - created entirely by computer.  It is a morph technology, and the scene looks great.  It's a shame that they had to cut it.  They also spend some time showing you how the technology works.Overall, Driven is cheesy and without plot that you will care about - but it is still fun!",4,Fun and Entertaining,1047686400,"03 15, 2003",2003,1403,"['Driven', 'pretty', 'much', 'typical', 'racing', 'flick', 'are', 'rivalries', 'drivers', 'people', 'who', 'go', ""'way"", 'back', 'therefore', ""'owe"", 'other', 'something', 'ticked', 'ex-wives', 'pain', 'old', 'failures', 'still', 'remembered', 'pressure', 'perform', 'more', 'today', 'yesterday', 'Typical', 'racing', 'movie', 'drama', 'junk', 'course', 'are', 'also', 'treated', 'lots', 'crash', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'flying', 'around', 'junk', 'landing', 'spectators', 'things', 'bursting', 'flames', 'even', 'car', 'flys', 'off', 'somehow', 'up', 'landing', 'pond', 'said', 'typical', 'racing', 'movie', 'blather.The', 'thing', 'Driven', 'cheesiness', 'still', 'entertaining', 'like', 'special', 'effects', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', 'include', 'showing', 'how', 'cars', 'crash', 'together', 'decent', 'tunnel', 'vision', 'stuff', 'POV', 'driver', 'really', 'cool', 'effect', 'rain', 'hitting', 'drivers', 'visor', 'being', 'pushed', 'off', 'air', 'currents', 'also', 'extra', 'DVD', 'particular', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'included', 'car', 'blowing', 'up', 'completely', 'created', 'entirely', 'computer', 'morph', 'technology', 'scene', 'great', 'shame', 'had', 'cut', 'also', 'spend', 'time', 'showing', 'how', 'technology', 'works.Overall', 'Driven', 'cheesy', 'plot', 'will', 'care', 'still', 'fun']",Driven VHS

Certain characters didn't really fit in with the story, relationships didn't develop into anything.  I enjoyed the racing scenes.  I'm not knowledgeable about the sport, so I can't critique the realism (or lack of).  The racing scenes are exciting and tense, but whenever the characters talk to each other, the scenes seemed to end abruptly.Renny Harlin has directed some very entertaining movies, one of them was &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, which also starred Sylvester Stallone.  He also directed the second &quot;Die Hard&quot; movie.  He knows what he's doing when it comes to action flicks.  So does Stallone of course, like him or not- he's starred in and wrote some of the most commercially successful action films ever.  So why wasn't this movie better?Many other reviewers here have pointed out something that I will have to concur with.  In nearly an hours worth of deleted and extended scenes, we have a chance to see what someone (unwisely) decided was unneccessary to the film.  Scene after scene- not of extra, gratuitous racing footage- but of important drama between the characters.  The story becomes much more fleshed out and the relationships deepen.  No, this probably wouldn't have won any Oscars... But I think it definitely wouldn't have been laughed off the screen by so many critics and viewers.This DVD really makes good use of the format.  The extra scenes also have Stallone's commentary throughout, which gives us even more information about what this movie was like before someone butchered it.  Renny Harlin has a running commentary over the feature.  There are two documentaries, one is a 15 minute look at the making of the film.

Renny Harlin has made much better movies, with far more of an attention span, not to mention a better hold on their emotional core.  Instead, it almost appears that this film was made by a graduate of the Michael Bay School of Hyper-Editing.  The fact that this film is slightly more in-depth then your average sports film (though not by much) gets completely lost in all the hubbub.Yes, the characters and situations are entirely off-the-shelf.  We often forget that there's a reason they're up there:  sometimes, they work.  Instead of simply leaving the cliches as-is, screenwriter/star Stallone takes them in a few new and interesting directions, and it's not really as predictable as you would think from any description you would hear.  Yes, there's a pushy agent.  He's the young hotshot's brother, though, and is pushy because he really does care.  Will the girl choose the young hero/hotshot, or go back to her ex?  If you can find your way into all of this, you'd be a bit surprised how well Stallone bends the rules.Cutting through the gloss, though, is the big problem.  Director Harlin edits like he's in a race with the afore-mentioned Bay, throwing in nifty point-of-view shots that merely serve to distract, even (especially?) in the dramatic scenes.That's not to say that none of this works.  There's an amusing chase through the streets of Chicago that re-capture the fun of some of Harlin's previous films, and the final race is cleverly shot.  If I had come in at the beginning of said race and stayed until the end, I might have figured the movie could have been worth my while.

I also follow CART, and yes: even as a more casual fan I can see that this movie does not accurately portrait the sport in every aspect - but its shouldn't have to, after all: hello, this is fiction! As far as an action-packed race movie goes, this piece is not at all bad! Sly Stallone is subtle where nobody expects him to be and really surprises with the superb portrayal of an aging athlete. The young and confused shooting-star driver is not at all that far away from a young and goofy Jenson Button in his second season in Formula One, and as far as Burt Reynolds goes: yeah, the wheelchair business undoubtly meant to allude to Frank Williams is kinda cheesy, but he is actually OK once you get past his plastic surgery damage.We own the DVD of this movie, and when you watch the extra footage of the movie that was cut-out, you just want to cry: the extra scenes would have made the movie SO SO SOOOO much better. The storyline, that in the existing version sometimes is sketchy would have obtained quite a bit of meat and depth.The special effects and the cinematography are really good, absolutely no complaints there, soundtrack is cool, and, oh yes, I forgot: Till Schweiger is also really good as the German ice-man.",3,not nearly as bad as its reputation,1021852800,"05 20, 2002",2002,1397,"['preface', 'review', 'saying', ""'m"", 'F1-fan', 'acidic', 'criticism', 'movie', 'received', 'far', 'worst', 'kind', 'came', 'corner', 'F1', 'journalists', 'also', 'follow', 'CART', 'yes', 'even', 'more', 'casual', 'fan', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'accurately', 'portrait', 'sport', 'aspect', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'hello', 'fiction', 'As', 'far', 'action-packed', 'race', 'movie', 'piece', 'not', 'bad', 'Sly', 'Stallone', 'subtle', 'where', 'nobody', 'be', 'really', 'surprises', 'superb', 'portrayal', 'aging', 'athlete', 'young', 'confused', 'shooting-star', 'driver', 'not', 'far', 'away', 'young', 'goofy', 'Jenson', 'Button', 'second', 'season', 'Formula', 'One', 'as', 'far', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'yeah', 'wheelchair', 'business', 'undoubtly', 'meant', 'allude', 'Frank', 'Williams', 'kinda', 'cheesy', 'actually', 'OK', 'get', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'damage.We', 'DVD', 'movie', 'when', 'watch', 'extra', 'footage', 'movie', 'was', 'cut-out', 'just', 'want', 'cry', 'extra', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'SO', 'SO', 'SOOOO', 'much', 'better', 'storyline', 'existing', 'version', 'sometimes', 'sketchy', 'would', 'have', 'obtained', 'quite', 'bit', 'meat', 'depth.The', 'special', 'effects', 'cinematography', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'absolutely', 'complaints', 'there', 'soundtrack', 'cool', 'oh', 'yes', 'forgot', 'Till', 'Schweiger', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'German', 'ice-man']",Driven VHS
537693,A2YSOM1A805PQP,B00003CXTL,Todd Gray,"[2, 4]","The latest movie from Sly takes us in the direction that we are all supposed to believe that he is a F1 racer. Now a washup (what a cliche) he is called upon to assist a new racer in winning the championship. The whole problem is that Sly is too defiant to follow the rules.The movie is directed by Renny Harlin, a man famous for blowing things up. This film affords him the opportunity of crashing numerous cars. Something that he makes full use of. This movie is supposed to be a twisted romance movie, with the occasional race thrown into keep the whitetrash at bay. The fact is that the racing action is all that any of the audience will care about, so why bother with a romantic theme.This is a movie that does not need to have any sort of plot, but the film maker tries to make you care about every race, and every character. The real fact is that by the time of the big final race, you just do not care who wins, since you do not feel an honest connection to any of these characters. All this audience wants from these people are for them to get in their cars and drive around in a circle really fast, and to see them crash.This film had a lot of potential, it does have a rotten washed up actor, but the director can do much better. It may be the fact that Sly wrote the screenplay, but the movie just feels disconnected in some way. There should be more to it (not much more, it is about racing, but something, anything) and when nothing is put in place, this movie starts to fall apart on itself.",2,"High Octane, But Unsatisfying",988243200,"04 26, 2001",2001,1506,"['latest', 'movie', 'Sly', 'direction', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'F1', 'racer', 'Now', 'washup', 'what', 'cliche', 'called', 'assist', 'new', 'racer', 'winning', 'championship', 'whole', 'problem', 'Sly', 'too', 'defiant', 'follow', 'rules.The', 'movie', 'directed', 'Renny', 'Harlin', 'man', 'famous', 'blowing', 'things', 'up', 'film', 'opportunity', 'crashing', 'numerous', 'cars', 'Something', 'full', 'use', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'twisted', 'romance', 'movie', 'occasional', 'race', 'thrown', 'keep', 'whitetrash', 'bay', 'fact', 'racing', 'action', 'audience', 'will', 'care', 'about', 'so', 'why', 'bother', 'romantic', 'theme.This', 'movie', 'not', 'need', 'have', 'sort', 'plot', 'film', 'maker', 'make', 'care', 'race', 'character', 'real', 'fact', 'time', 'big', 'final', 'race', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'honest', 'connection', 'characters', 'audience', 'people', 'are', 'get', 'cars', 'drive', 'around', 'circle', 'really', 'fast', 'see', 'crash.This', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'have', 'rotten', 'washed', 'up', 'actor', 'director', 'can', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'may', 'be', 'fact', 'Sly', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'just', 'feels', 'disconnected', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'racing', 'something', 'anything', 'when', 'nothing', 'put', 'place', 'movie', 'fall', 'apart']",Driven VHS
