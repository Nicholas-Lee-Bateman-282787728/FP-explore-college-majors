But the scripts are highly complex and often confusing.  The best example of this flaw is ""Service Of All the Dead.""  I defy anyone to explain the plot after seeing it.  Moreover, the anti-clericalism in the film is extreme and offensive, and the ending is melodramatic and wholly unconvincing.  In short, this series on the whole is okay, but when it bombs the explosion tends to make one forget about earlier, more pleasant, programs.",3,Disappointing in places,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,561,"['collection', 'one', 'exception', 'passable', 'entertainment', 'acting', 'photography', 'are', 'consistently', 'average', 'scripts', 'are', 'highly', 'complex', 'often', 'confusing', 'best', 'example', 'flaw', 'Service', 'All', 'Dead', 'defy', 'anyone', 'explain', 'plot', 'seeing', 'Moreover', 'anti-clericalism', 'film', 'extreme', 'offensive', 'ending', 'melodramatic', 'wholly', 'unconvincing', 'short', 'series', 'whole', 'okay', 'when', 'bombs', 'explosion', 'make', 'one', 'forget', 'earlier', 'more', 'pleasant', 'programs']",N/A

There are eleven ""Sets"", called ""Inspector Morse Set One"", and so on.

According to composer Barrington Pheloung, in ""The Making of Morse"", in some episodes the Morse codespells out the name of the murderer OR the a cryptic version of the killer's name OR the name of an innocent suspect. If another viewer has a better ear than me, I would love to hear about your discoveries of a Morse episode where the theme music spells out something other than M.O.R.S.E. in Morse code! (I've added a photo of the code for M.O.R.S.E.!)Dexter has a walk-on in all but three ""Inspector Morse"" episodes.In the Inspector Morse books, written by Colin Dexter, Sergeant Lewis is in his 60's. Kevin Whately was only 26 when he auditioned, but he was so perfect that he got the part in the TV series. Good thing, given that the series lasted 13 years, and we now get to see Whately's follow-up series, ""Inspector Lewis"" [ Masterpiece Mystery: Complete Inspector Lewis ], which I also recommend.THE DEAD OF JERICHO:This episode shows us three of what will become Morse hallmarks: He is unlucky in love. He doesn't give out his first name. And when Lewis accompanies Morse to a pub, he usually ends up paying and half the time Morse is ready to go before Lewis is half-started.Chief Inspector Morse is late to choir practice. He's got his eye on another choir member, Anne Stavely (played by Gemma Jones). He walks her home and she says, ""You know, I don't know your first name.""Morse, ""That's right.""Anne, ""So?""Morse, ""I don't use it.""""That's silly!""""It's my parents who were silly.""Morse shows up at Anne's home to pick her up for their choir concert. The door is open and he calls to her, but he eventually has to go alone. She never shows up, and he finds out why. She's been found hanging in her bedroom. Morse cannot believe that it could be suicide. Detective Sergeant Lewis asks an important question: ""Did Sophocles do it?""Trivia: Jericho is an area of Oxford. The episode was written by Anthony Minghella, based on Colin Dexter's 5th Morse novel of the same name, originally published in 1981. In this first episode, Lewis (played by Kevin Whately) is attached to Chief Inspector Bell, not Morse. Bell is promoted at the end of the episode, moving up to Superintendent at another branch. This leaves Lewis to move over to work with Morse.Morse has trouble viewing Anne's body, not only because of his personal association with her, but because Morse has a phobia of dead bodies, which we see throughout the show. He also is scared of heights (hypsophobia) and flying (aerophobia).THE SILENT WORLD OF NICHOLAS QUINN:It starts with a Thursday cocktail reception at the Foreign Examination Syndicate. Nicolas Quinn, who works at the syndicate, spends most of the reception trying to adjust his hearing aid. He leaves the reception with another employee, Philip Ogleby, telling Philip that Roope and Tom Bartlett are selling exam secrets.The following Monday, Quinn's body is found at his home, and Morse is sure that it is murder. Does Morse's law apply? As he tells Lewis: ""You know Morse's Law? There's always a 50/50 chance that the man who found the body, did the deed.""This is the first episode where we see Morse with one of his passions, crossword puzzles. He interviews Ogleby (played with excellent intelligence and slyness by Michael Gough), and finds out that Ogleby is Daedelus, a demon crossword setter who frequently bedevils Morse with his 5 Down. But, is Ogleby TOO clever?Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on Colin Dexter's 3rd novel of the same name, published in 1977. Dexter knew a bit about deafness. He was a grammar school classics teacher until 1966, when he was forced to retire by the onset of deafness. He then took a post as Senior Assistant Secretary at the University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE). That's not quite the same as the type of examinations in this episode, but there are similarities.Colin Dexter is a dedicated crossword puzzler himself. He named his two main characters after his favourite crossword compilers, Sir Jeremy Morse and Mrs. B. Lewis!SERVICE OF THE ALL DEAD:Morse and Lewis are called to the church of St. Oswald's. The body of church warden Harry Josephs lies in the vestry, stabbed through the chest. They figure it was done by a tramp named Swan, who was at the service, according to the few congregants who attended. Then Max de Bryn, the rumpled pathologist who admires Morse and meets him head to head, drops a bombshell. Josephs was dead from a large amount of morphine mixed with wine - before he was stabbed. Morse tells Lewis, ""I'm not supposing anything until I've had at least two pints of beer."" Another hallmark of Inspector Morse. A pint, as he says, helps him think.Morse goes to the church to ask Vicar Lionel Pawlin to come down to the station for questioning. Then follows one of the most memorable scenes in the Morse canon, set to haunting music. (Which scene I won't give away.)Trivia: This is the first episode, but not the last, where we see Morse's fear of heights. This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on Colin Dexter's 4th novel of the same name, published in 1980.THE WOLVERCOTE TONGUE:A tour bus pulls into Oxford. It's a high-end tour with only 12 participants, lead by the tired and disaffected guide, Sheila Williams. She rushes from the bus to meet Dr. Simon Kemp - whose name should be Dr. Shallow - only to have him tell her his wife says he can't see her anymore.Laura and Eddie Poindexter are on the tour. The Oxford stop is important, because the wealthy Laura is donating the Wolvercote Tongue to the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology. The tongue is part of an ornate two piece belt buckle, somehow separated after they were dug up together. The Ashmolean already has the buckle. Eddie returns to their Randolph Hotel room to find Laura dead and the Wolvercote Tongue gone. Was it really just a heart attack?Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on a short story by Colin Dexter. In 1992, well after the TV episode first aired, Dexter expanded the short story into a novel titled ""The Jewel That Was Ours"", though there are differences between the novel and the show. This episode is full of lovely wry humor, especially in the interactions between Morse, Lewis and Max de Bryn, the pathologist.LAST SEEN WEARING:Morse is grumpy when he's given a new file. It's Valerie Craven, a teenager missing for six months. Lewis is raring to go, trying to give Morse the 3 files compiled on the missing girl, but Morse isn't interested: ""I'm sorry to disappoint you, Lewis, but she's dead.... They put me onto these things when they can smell a corpse. One file - Anybody. Two files - Ainsley or McCay. I'm the three-file man. No, she's dead.""Another reason Morse is disgusted with the case. He's supposed to solve it, but he's not supposed to bother the family. He interviews the father anyway (which gets him in trouble). Lewis: ""The thing with you is, if somebody tells you you can't do something, you go right on and do it, don't you?""Morse: ""I make it a rule.""This is a murder mystery, so there's going to be a body. But will it be Valerie's?Trivia: This episode was written by Thomas Ellice, based on the 2nd Colin Dexter novel of the same name, published in 1976.",5,Episode Synopsis of a Terrific Beginning to a
