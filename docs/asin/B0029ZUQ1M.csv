1257756,A17ELHFWMGGH3T,B0029ZUQ1M,"Christine D. Sumpter ""CanesGalactica""","[0, 0]","First of all, I would like to state that this review comes from a person who formerly had no knowledge of this show or what it was about. I bought this from Amazon on a whim, looking for new titles I hadn't seen before.Kare Kano really starts off as a story about the blossoming friendship/romance between the main two characters of the story, but actually progresses past that and delves into the stories of all the fellow classmates. In that regard, it is similar to Azumanga Diaoh and indeed, this anime has many funny points. For anyone who has been to a public high school, I think it will be easy to relate to the characters in this story, even if romance isn't your thing (certainly isn't mine). The two characters actually grow as people throughout the story as do a number of the other characters. Personally, I think that kind of thing is rare in film today, especially in a series.So I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this all the way through and actually enjoyed it.My only source of contention with this series is that it didn't feel like the ending was really an ending. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but I felt I was left hanging.Also, it should be noted that there are several different styles of animation utilized in this series, which kind of keeps things going. There's a bit of live-action play, storyboard art used in place of actual animation, manga panels, etc. This should come as no surprise to those who have seen Gainax's other titles (FLCL comes to mind). Personally, I felt this unconventional use of different styles kept the stories from getting too boring or stagnant.I would gladly recommend this to people to watch who enjoy a more down to earth story than what might typically be found in anime.",4,Highschool Romance At Its Best,1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,1754,"['First', 'would', 'like', 'state', 'review', 'person', 'who', 'formerly', 'had', 'knowledge', 'show', 'what', 'was', 'bought', 'Amazon', 'whim', 'looking', 'new', 'titles', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before.Kare', 'Kano', 'really', 'off', 'story', 'blossoming', 'friendship/romance', 'main', 'two', 'characters', 'story', 'actually', 'stories', 'fellow', 'classmates', 'regard', 'similar', 'Azumanga', 'Diaoh', 'indeed', 'anime', 'many', 'funny', 'points', 'anyone', 'who', 'been', 'public', 'high', 'school', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'easy', 'relate', 'characters', 'story', 'even', 'romance', ""n't"", 'thing', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'mine', 'two', 'characters', 'actually', 'grow', 'people', 'story', 'do', 'number', 'other', 'characters', 'Personally', 'think', 'kind', 'thing', 'rare', 'film', 'today', 'especially', 'series.So', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'when', 'watched', 'way', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'it.My', 'only', 'source', 'contention', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ending', 'was', 'really', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'intentional', 'not', 'felt', 'was', 'left', 'hanging.Also', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'are', 'several', 'different', 'styles', 'animation', 'utilized', 'series', 'kind', 'keeps', 'things', 'going', 'bit', 'live-action', 'play', 'storyboard', 'art', 'used', 'place', 'actual', 'animation', 'manga', 'panels', 'etc', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'Gainax', 'other', 'titles', 'FLCL', 'mind', 'Personally', 'felt', 'unconventional', 'use', 'different', 'styles', 'kept', 'stories', 'getting', 'too', 'boring', 'stagnant.I', 'would', 'gladly', 'recommend', 'people', 'watch', 'who', 'enjoy', 'more', 'down', 'earth', 'story', 'what', 'might', 'typically', 'be', 'found', 'anime']",His & Her Circumstances: Complete Series

The 'positive' reviews definitely say it all - there is no other way to say how wonderful this series is.  Wholly and completely, even if you watch and happen to feel the 2nd half loses some steam you will still be watching and/or have watched one of the finest anime you'll ever lay eyes on, if not only within this genre, possibly among all of them.The only thing I want to add is something missing from the Amazon list of inclusions, which is to say something that isn't noted.  Where they have listed: ""Special Features: None"" that's incorrect.  I realize not EVERYONE cares whether special features are included, ""His and Her Circumstances"" contains: Director Notes, Translation Notes, Production Notes, Character Bios (something I always read and love regardless of the title - I think these are often quite funny when done properly and they help when watching because you can watch *through* the character's eyes so to speak; and see things as they would see them.  There's also: Storyboards, VA Interviews, English VA Outtakes, Phone Messages, the Original Trailer, and of course, trailers.  (Trailers are basically a staple on any DVD/BD collection even when there are no other special features.  When the trailers are for titles I've already seen I still watch all of them for fun and fairly often I run across something I haven't seen in a while causing me to go to my own library like collection so i can re-watch something I haven't seen for a while.)Back on point - ""His and Her Circumstances"" has a nearly zero percent chance of boring you or leaving you wishing you'd never seen it.  When I first bought it I did so ""sight unseen"" (basically) and from the trailer alone.  I didn't read a single review until AFTER I'd seen it.  This is an entirely superb 26 episodes.  I'm writing this now actually because I'm back on Amazon buying another set.  My first set was loaned out to a friend and accidentally damaged (just one disc) but since I didn't want an unplayable disc she got to keep the set and go hunting for the single replacement and I'll replace the entire collection for myself.  For under 30 bucks it's a steal anyway...I'd pay double in a heart beat.  (Maybe I shouldn't say that here where an Amazonian might see it and jack the price up!  But it should also speak volumes about what I thought of the series.) :-)A quick list of some others: ""Suzuka, Ai Yori Aoshi, Peach Girl, Love Hina, To Heart, Boys Be, Rumbling Hearts, Kanon, Clannad, Air"" (there are still more of course) - and some definitely go a different route than others with truly heart-wrenching moments, a couple of which bring me to tears every time I watch them. (I'm a 40 year old man unashamed of a single tear shed simply because they are **THAT POWERFUL**).  If you've seen any or all of those I listed I assure you, you will like ""His and Her Circumstances"".  And if you're looking for more recommendations, well there ya go! ;-)I hope you enjoy as much as I have, each and every time!!",5,Hard to Top The Current Reviews!!,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,3024,"['hard', 'top', 'most', 'anyway', ""'positive"", 'reviews', 'definitely', 'say', 'other', 'way', 'say', 'how', 'wonderful', 'series', 'Wholly', 'completely', 'even', 'watch', 'happen', 'feel', '2nd', 'half', 'steam', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'watching', 'and/or', 'have', 'watched', 'one', 'finest', 'anime', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'lay', 'eyes', 'not', 'only', 'genre', 'possibly', 'them.The', 'only', 'thing', 'want', 'add', 'something', 'missing', 'Amazon', 'list', 'inclusions', 'say', 'something', ""n't"", 'noted', 'Where', 'have', 'listed', 'Special', 'Features', 'None', 'incorrect', 'realize', 'not', 'EVERYONE', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'Circumstances', 'contains', 'Director', 'Notes', 'Translation', 'Notes', 'Production', 'Notes', 'Character', 'Bios', 'something', 'always', 'read', 'love', 'regardless', 'title', 'think', 'are', 'often', 'quite', 'funny', 'when', 'done', 'properly', 'help', 'when', 'watching', 'can', 'watch', '*through*', 'character', 'eyes', 'so', 'speak', 'see', 'things', 'would', 'see', 'also', 'Storyboards', 'VA', 'Interviews', 'English', 'VA', 'Outtakes', 'Phone', 'Messages', 'Original', 'Trailer', 'course', 'trailers', 'Trailers', 'are', 'basically', 'staple', 'DVD/BD', 'collection', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'When', 'trailers', 'are', 'titles', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'still', 'watch', 'fun', 'fairly', 'often', 'run', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'while', 'causing', 'go', 'own', 'library', 'collection', 'i', 'can', 're-watch', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'while', 'Back', 'point', 'Circumstances', 'nearly', 'zero', 'percent', 'chance', 'boring', 'leaving', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'When', 'first', 'bought', 'did', 'so', 'sight', 'unseen', 'basically', 'trailer', 'alone', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'single', 'review', 'AFTER', ""'d"", 'seen', 'entirely', 'superb', '26', 'episodes', ""'m"", 'writing', 'now', 'actually', ""'m"", 'back', 'Amazon', 'buying', 'set', 'first', 'set', 'was', 'loaned', 'out', 'friend', 'accidentally', 'damaged', 'just', 'one', 'disc', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'unplayable', 'disc', 'got', 'keep', 'set', 'go', 'hunting', 'single', 'replacement', ""'ll"", 'replace', 'entire', 'collection', 'myself', '30', 'bucks', 'steal', 'anyway', ""'d"", 'pay', 'double', 'heart', 'beat', 'Maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'say', 'here', 'where', 'Amazonian', 'might', 'see', 'jack', 'price', 'up', 'should', 'also', 'speak', 'volumes', 'what', 'thought', 'series', 'quick', 'list', 'others', 'Suzuka', 'Ai', 'Yori', 'Aoshi', 'Peach', 'Girl', 'Love', 'Hina', 'Heart', 'Boys', 'Be', 'Rumbling', 'Hearts', 'Kanon', 'Clannad', 'Air', 'are', 'still', 'more', 'course', 'definitely', 'go', 'different', 'route', 'others', 'truly', 'heart-wrenching', 'moments', 'couple', 'bring', 'tears', 'time', 'watch', ""'m"", '40', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'unashamed', 'single', 'tear', 'shed', 'simply', 'are', '**THAT', 'POWERFUL**', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'listed', 'assure', 'will', 'like', 'Circumstances', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'recommendations', 'well', 'there', 'go', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'time']",His & Her Circumstances: Complete Series

1257760,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B0029ZUQ1M,"Jonathan Oyama ""Welcome to die!""","[2, 2]","""His & Her Circumstances"" eases anime watchers with touching teenager romance, even if quality declined at the end.This series has suffered from mixed reviews throughout its run. Director Hideaki Anno, known as the director of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion,"" helmed the production of this series. However, the series literally degenerated as the director fought with Masami Tsuda, the original manga artist of this series.For anyone unfamiliar with the manga, ""Kare Kano"" is about a girl named Yukino Miyazawa. She is a talented, beautiful overachiever who strives for perfection. She's frustrated with having to compete with Soichiro Arima, a boy who is also one of the top students.Unlike Arima, Miyazawa is a spoiled slob at home who studies endlessly to maintain her grades. Arima discovers her alter-ego when he arrives at Miyazawa's house to return a Brahms CD he borrowed from her. At first, he threatens to reveal her secret facade by forcing her to do his work for the student council for a few days. However, their feelings gradually deepen for each other. After a small argument, they begin to care for each other.""His or Her Circumstances"" takes a closer look at the complications of high school romance. It also looks into the deeper problems of Arima's own family conflicts. His own parents were blackmailers, who deserted him because of a huge debt they couldn't pay off. Although this series tends to ramble during some episodes, it never loses its charm until the director of the series quit working on the series.Certainly this series has its flaws. The ending sequence is a boring motion sequences with a live camera in a Japanese high school. Parts of the series were taken out of the DVD because of arguments between animation studio Gainax and the manga artist. The last story arc of the series remains unfinished.Yet the series never loses the charm it retains in the opening sequence. ""His & Her Circumstances"" easily has the best opening animation of a shoujo series ever. The theme song, ""Tenshi no Yubikiri"" (translated as ""The Angel's promise""), is a lovely ballad as charming as an American Motown song. Viewers will be even more impressed by Anno's ability to mix the psychological elements of ""Evangelion"" seamlessly into a romantic atmosphere.Overall, ""His & Her Circumstances"" is a must-buy. The warm relationship of Miyazawa and Arima is worth every penny, no matter how you may argue about the unfinished ending. Everything, from the beautiful character designs to the touching anime shading, is too wonderful to pass up.",5,Beautifully flawed anime classic,1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,2551,"['Circumstances', 'anime', 'watchers', 'touching', 'teenager', 'romance', 'even', 'quality', 'declined', 'end.This', 'series', 'suffered', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'run', 'Director', 'Hideaki', 'Anno', 'known', 'director', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'helmed', 'production', 'series', 'However', 'series', 'literally', 'degenerated', 'director', 'fought', 'Masami', 'Tsuda', 'original', 'manga', 'artist', 'series.For', 'anyone', 'unfamiliar', 'manga', 'Kare', 'Kano', 'girl', 'named', 'Yukino', 'Miyazawa', 'talented', 'beautiful', 'overachiever', 'who', 'perfection', 'frustrated', 'having', 'compete', 'Soichiro', 'Arima', 'boy', 'who', 'also', 'one', 'top', 'students.Unlike', 'Arima', 'Miyazawa', 'spoiled', 'slob', 'home', 'who', 'studies', 'endlessly', 'maintain', 'grades', 'Arima', 'alter-ego', 'when', 'Miyazawa', 'house', 'return', 'Brahms', 'CD', 'borrowed', 'first', 'reveal', 'secret', 'facade', 'forcing', 'do', 'work', 'student', 'council', 'few', 'days', 'However', 'feelings', 'gradually', 'deepen', 'other', 'small', 'argument', 'begin', 'care', 'other', 'Circumstances', 'closer', 'look', 'complications', 'high', 'school', 'romance', 'also', 'deeper', 'problems', 'Arima', 'own', 'family', 'conflicts', 'own', 'parents', 'were', 'blackmailers', 'who', 'deserted', 'huge', 'debt', 'could', ""n't"", 'pay', 'off', 'series', 'ramble', 'episodes', 'never', 'charm', 'director', 'series', 'quit', 'working', 'series.Certainly', 'series', 'flaws', 'ending', 'sequence', 'boring', 'motion', 'sequences', 'live', 'camera', 'Japanese', 'high', 'school', 'Parts', 'series', 'were', 'taken', 'DVD', 'arguments', 'animation', 'studio', 'Gainax', 'manga', 'artist', 'last', 'story', 'arc', 'series', 'series', 'never', 'charm', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Circumstances', 'easily', 'best', 'opening', 'animation', 'shoujo', 'series', 'ever', 'theme', 'song', 'Tenshi', 'Yubikiri', 'translated', 'Angel', 'promise', 'lovely', 'ballad', 'as', 'charming', 'American', 'Motown', 'song', 'Viewers', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'impressed', 'Anno', 'ability', 'mix', 'psychological', 'elements', 'Evangelion', 'seamlessly', 'romantic', 'atmosphere.Overall', 'Circumstances', 'must-buy', 'warm', 'relationship', 'Miyazawa', 'Arima', 'worth', 'penny', 'matter', 'how', 'may', 'argue', 'unfinished', 'ending', 'Everything', 'beautiful', 'character', 'designs', 'touching', 'anime', 'shading', 'too', 'wonderful', 'pass', 'up']",His & Her Circumstances: Complete Series

1257764,A1QQ5HHZ7D4EE4,B0029ZUQ1M,Russell J. LEBAR,"[7, 7]","A fun, romantic comedy. The two main characters are both the stereotypical perfect students, except it's really a facade. The humor is how the facade is revealed and the trials and tribulations the two main characters go through after they start being themselves -- or more to the point, learning who they are.This isn't a perfect series -- in fact, it's pretty obvious the budget was a big issue by the end of the project. And as another reviewer indicated, the quality of the DVD case could be better. But the first half of the series (especially the first two to three disks) are amazingly well done with insights into relationships, growing, and discovering who you really are coupled with comedic elements. The presentation often uses anga-like elements, giving it a unique style. And it works really well (at least until the budget runs out).It reminds me of Fruits Basket (though His and Her came out first). Presentation wise, a lot of different Anime styles are used throughout (e.g. exaggerated ones for comedic scenes and more realistic ones for serious ones). And there are lots of tidbits of wisdom. The difference is His and Her is mainly focused on the relationship and discovering who you are while Fruits Basket is more about life in general (including relationships).Rightstuf also did an amazing job producing the English version. There is a lot of Japanese on screen at times (the manga-like presentation elements) and Rightstuf actually spent the extra time to present the English version in the same area on the screen, using similar colors -- something that sounds easy but is actually very difficult.The way I look at this series is to consider the really well done first half as the main feature, with the weaker second half as extra bonus material. Or to put it differently, the first half is so well done that most people will overlook the weaker second half.It's that rare series that manages to be different and yet really good.",5,Amazing romance and comedy,1257984000,"11 12, 2009",2009,1957,"['fun', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'stereotypical', 'perfect', 'students', 'really', 'facade', 'humor', 'how', 'facade', 'revealed', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'go', 'start', 'being', 'more', 'point', 'learning', 'who', 'are.This', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'series', 'fact', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'budget', 'was', 'big', 'issue', 'end', 'project', 'reviewer', 'indicated', 'quality', 'DVD', 'case', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'especially', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'disks', 'are', 'amazingly', 'well', 'done', 'insights', 'relationships', 'growing', 'discovering', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'coupled', 'comedic', 'elements', 'presentation', 'often', 'anga-like', 'elements', 'giving', 'unique', 'style', 'really', 'well', 'least', 'budget', 'out', '.It', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'came', 'out', 'first', 'Presentation', 'wise', 'lot', 'different', 'Anime', 'styles', 'are', 'used', 'e.g', 'exaggerated', 'ones', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'more', 'realistic', 'ones', 'serious', 'ones', 'are', 'lots', 'tidbits', 'wisdom', 'difference', 'Her', 'mainly', 'focused', 'relationship', 'discovering', 'who', 'are', 'Fruits', 'Basket', 'more', 'life', 'general', 'including', 'relationships', '.Rightstuf', 'also', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'producing', 'English', 'version', 'lot', 'Japanese', 'screen', 'times', 'manga-like', 'presentation', 'elements', 'Rightstuf', 'actually', 'spent', 'extra', 'time', 'present', 'English', 'version', 'same', 'area', 'screen', 'using', 'similar', 'colors', 'something', 'easy', 'actually', 'very', 'difficult.The', 'way', 'look', 'series', 'consider', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'first', 'half', 'main', 'feature', 'weaker', 'second', 'half', 'extra', 'material', 'put', 'differently', 'first', 'half', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'overlook', 'weaker', 'second', 'half.It', 'rare', 'series', 'be', 'different', 'yet', 'really', 'good']",His & Her Circumstances: Complete Series

In truth, this model student was actually an obsessive narcissist who works herself ragged to win the praise of teachers and the awe of classmates. Her secret seemed safe, until she met Souichirou Arima, another seemingly perfect student, who ends up outclassing her. She at first doesn't know how to handle this, but then comes an opportunity when he actually confesses his love for her. But what at first appears to her to be as an ace in the hole ends up being the beginning of a life changing year in this unusual series.The story is told primarily through the eyes of Yukino, the seemingly perfect girl, who in truth is rather eccentric and an absolute delight to observe as she tries to adapt to her new reality. We also get to meet Arima, the nice guy with the troubled past, as well as the large number of additional cast members that come into the story line as it progresses. The story is told mostly in a straight forward manner, but there are several episodes that use flashbacks, occasional live shots, and even partly drawn single frame shots, which make this story all the more interesting. If there is any flaw in this story, it may be that the characters sometimes come off as harsh at times, but not having seen the Japanese version, I can't tell if the dialogue was correctly translated, so there may be less to this than I think.Do these characters live happily ever after? They don't say. (in fact, at the end, there's a hint of a whole other story line beginning) But I can say that this story is nicely told, and very well drawn. There's a lot to like about ""His and Her Circumstances"" and I think it's more than worth your time.",5,This is the story of a girl....and a guy.,1295481600,"01 20, 2011",2011,1762,"['Yukino', 'Miyazawa', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'girl', 'came', 'high', 'school', 'wind', 'back', 'theory', 'least', 'truth', 'model', 'student', 'was', 'actually', 'obsessive', 'narcissist', 'who', 'ragged', 'win', 'praise', 'teachers', 'awe', 'classmates', 'secret', 'seemed', 'safe', 'met', 'Souichirou', 'Arima', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'student', 'who', 'up', 'outclassing', 'first', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'handle', 'then', 'opportunity', 'when', 'actually', 'love', 'what', 'first', 'be', 'ace', 'hole', 'up', 'being', 'beginning', 'life', 'changing', 'year', 'unusual', 'series.The', 'story', 'told', 'primarily', 'eyes', 'Yukino', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'girl', 'who', 'truth', 'rather', 'eccentric', 'absolute', 'delight', 'observe', 'adapt', 'new', 'reality', 'also', 'get', 'meet', 'Arima', 'nice', 'guy', 'troubled', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'large', 'number', 'additional', 'cast', 'members', 'come', 'story', 'line', 'story', 'told', 'mostly', 'straight', 'forward', 'manner', 'are', 'several', 'episodes', 'use', 'flashbacks', 'occasional', 'live', 'shots', 'even', 'partly', 'drawn', 'single', 'frame', 'shots', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'flaw', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'come', 'off', 'harsh', 'times', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'Japanese', 'version', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'dialogue', 'was', 'correctly', 'translated', 'may', 'be', 'less', 'think.Do', 'characters', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'fact', 'end', 'hint', 'whole', 'other', 'story', 'line', 'beginning', 'can', 'say', 'story', 'nicely', 'told', 'very', 'well', 'drawn', 'lot', 'like', 'Circumstances', 'think', 'more', 'time']",His & Her Circumstances: Complete Series

I'd definitely describe this as a rom/com but there is enough drama thrown in to add an element of tension and keep you on your toes. First saw a few episodes of this series many years ago in college when I was part of the anime club and it stuck with me ever since till here, years later, I decided to track it down and order the complete series. For the price, I definitely think it is worth it.",5,Great Series,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,532,"['one', 'favorite', 'anime', 'series', 'are', ""n't"", 'bit', 'romantic', 'heart', 'then', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'entertaining', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'describe', 'rom/com', 'enough', 'drama', 'thrown', 'add', 'element', 'tension', 'keep', 'toes', 'First', 'saw', 'few', 'episodes', 'series', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'college', 'when', 'was', 'part', 'anime', 'club', 'stuck', 'ever', 'till', 'here', 'years', 'later', 'decided', 'track', 'down', 'order', 'complete', 'series', 'price', 'definitely', 'think']",His & Her Circumstances: Complete Series
