It does have many interesting quotes about the founding fathers and their faith, but its relentless pushing of prayer and Bible reading in public schools was a major turnoff.If I had to been forced to read the Qu'ran or say Muslim prayers in school, I certainly would have been offended -- and we can't ignore the fact that many Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist and nonreligious parents and children live in the United States and would be furious if students were forced to say Christian prayers and read the Bible.Whether or not the U.S. was founded as a Christian nation, the fact remains that not everyone who lives here is Christian. Our faith is not about forcing Christianity down others' throats.I also had to laugh at the part directly correlating droput rates, teen pregnancy, etc. with the decision to end prayer in schools.

This video masterpiece is packed with historical evidence that shows how our country was founded on Christian principles. It also reveals the critical situation we are in (in case you hadn't noticed) because of rogue judges that have allowed a very small minority of God-hating individuals to secularize public entities, namely schools.After seeing this video for the first time last night, my son and I are determined to do all we can to help educate and encourage others.

Lengthy digressions appear out of nowhere, sometimes serving a purpose, but sometimes serving only to derail whatever point he his trying to make.

Mr. Barton displays his familiarity with not only the attitudes and beliefs of the founders, but also the documents, speeches, acts and legal decisions over a period of centuries. He conclusively shows that America is indeed a Christian nation and that court decisions of the last fifty or so years stand the original intent of the Founders on it's head.Mr. Barton quotes directly from the early documents, and the public and private correspondence of our Founders. He shows conclusively that every court decision up to the post-WWII courts laden with ultra-leftists consistently upheld the concept of America as a Christian nation and that the US government was founded on Christian morality.The video shows so many opinions, writings, speeches and actions of the US government and courts that universally state that America is a Christian nation that the last several generations stand in stark contrast to most of the nation's history. there is no doubt that contemporary attitudes of both government and courts is the work of leftist activists without even the thinnest shred of legal precedence to fall back on.This is an excellent and well-argued production for the right-thinking American and equips the viewer to contend with the fallacious &#34;separation of church and state&#34; argument.

387363,A1LTJCQGRPTOTD,6303891284,STEPHEN T. McCARTHY,"[76, 87]","In 1993, a friend / coworker loaned me his videocassette of David Barton's, 'AMERICA'S GODLY HERITAGE.'  Knowing that I was not what the ""orthodox"" Christian Church would call a ""Christian"", he said almost half-apologetically, ""I think you might find this interesting....but I don't know.  Maybe not.""  Instead, he should have handed me the tape with immense boldness!It is a great understatement to say that I was totally unprepared for the information contained in 'AMERICA'S GODLY HERITAGE.'  Like most Americans, I had been brainwashed into believing that ""SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE"" was some foundational principle in our form of government.  I had been conditioned by our social engineers (academia; the judiciary; the media; and the scoundrels that we continually send to Washington D.C. to represent us) to accept the seeds of secular Socialism.  And being too ""busy"" (read: lazy) to read ""THE SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND"" for myself (Pssst. It's called, 'THE CONSTITUTION'), I didn't know any better.  Shame on me!  'AMERICA'S GODLY HERITAGE' convicted me of ignorance, and viewing it was the first step I took on my way to becoming a bona fide ""patriot.""I am appalled by how often I find deceivers misrepresenting the truth in their Amazon reviews; taking information out of context in order to distort it and deliberately mislead others.  Often their own words expose the fact that they are not even familiar with the material they are pretending to review.On this Product Page we have a ""Christian HISTORIAN"" who, ignoring the fact that the vast majority of America's Founding Fathers were members of orthodox Christian churches, seizes upon statements from a few of the less religious Founders to paint an inaccurate picture.  And quoting the Treaty of Tripoly out of context hardly reveals the whole story behind it!Our ""Christian HISTORIAN"" neglects to tell us that........John Adams said, ""The general principles on which the fathers achieved independence were...the general principles of Christianity.""John Jay declared, ""Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty - as well as the privilege and interest - of our Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.""  But what did John Jay know?  He was only the original Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, and one of the 3 men most responsible for the Constitution!Our ""Christian HISTORIAN"" would have us believe that the ""Father Of His Country"", George Washington, was not a Christian.  This is the same Washington who told his troops at Valley Forge :""To the distinguished character of Patriot, it should be our highest glory to laud the more distinguished character of Christian.""  The same Washington whose June 14, 1783 prayer for the U.S.A. included this plea: ""Almighty God, we make our earnest prayer that Thou wilt keep the United States in Thy Holy protection...Grant our supplication, we beseech Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.""  You'll find that on a plaque in St. Paul's Chapel in New York City, and at Pohick Church, Fairfax County, Virginia, where this ""non-Christian"", Washington, was a vestryman from 1762 to 1784.Yeah, our reviewer is a ""Christian HISTORIAN"" like I'm a six-year-old Hindu girl from Dogbreath Falls, Minnesota!  As of this date, his total Amazon content consists of only 3 reviews: 2 of them bashing David Barton, and the third one praising some Rock album with ""driving distorted guitars with a tinge of punk and attitude.""  Just what one would expect from a ""Christian HISTORIAN"", right?  He titled his review of this videotape, ""THIS IS FICTION.""  I agree with his title, but only if it is referring to the review he posted below it!'AMERICA'S GODLY HERITAGE' holds a wealth of surprising information, and David Barton has so much to tell us that he must deliver it in double-time fashion.  This tape probably won't ""entertain"" you, but it will quite possibly shock you!  But this is just the tip of the iceberg.  His masterpiece of research is the scholarly tome, 'ORIGINAL INTENT: The Courts, The Constitution, & Religion' - a Five Star book if ever there was one! David Barton is the owner of many original documents from the Founding era, and he maintains a great website: [...]The ""Christian HISTORIAN"" says that America was not founded on Judeo-Christian principles, but was intended as a secular nation.  This ""non-Christian"" says he's wrong!  Believe who you will.The 39 men who signed the U.S. Constitution concluded it with, ""Done in convention by the unanimous consent of the States present, the seventeenth day of September, in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven.""Now which ""LORD"" do you suppose the Founders had in mind?
