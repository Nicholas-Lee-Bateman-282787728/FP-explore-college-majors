303787,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,6302250161,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[9, 9]","The Smurfs and the Magic Flute was directed by the Smurfs creator Peyo and was released to theaters in 1976 in Belgium, and 1979 in the United Kingdom. In 1981, NBC aired The Smurfs from Hanna-Barbera and it was an instant success. An English dubbed version of The Smurfs and the Magic Flute came out to theaters in the USA in 1983. Despite being disliked by critics, the move was a box-office success. Over the years it has been only available on VHS, but never on DVD, until now.The movie centers on a young squire, Johan, and his goofy sidekick, Peewit, (Peyo created the characters in 1952 and then created the Smurfs in 1958). Peewit gets a hold of a flute that has only six holes. Whoever is playing the flute can control other people by making them dance.A stranger, Matthew McCreep, steels the flute from Peewit and uses the flute to rob people. The King sends Johan and Peewit to retrieve the flute or their kingdom may fall. They fail at their first attempt to get the flute back, causing them to seek the help of a wizard who magically sends them to Smurfland.Papa Smurf and the other Smurfs agree to make a new flute for them. Before the Smurfs can hand them the flute, Johan and Peewit are zapped back to their world. The Smurfs journey to the other world to help stop McCreep before he takes over the castle.Shout! Factory has brought The Smurfs and the Magic Flute to DVD, but they used the UK Dubbed version and not the English Dubbed version for some odd reason. So the voices are different, and the names have been changed, such as Peewit is now William and Johan is now John! The picture quality is pretty good, up until the ending. There are a few extras - image gallery, glossary of Smurf terms, The Smurf Story, character guide, etc.This is not the best animated movie I have ever seen. It takes forever for a Smurf to actually show up! I can only recommend the movie to Smurf fans and new fans may not appreciate it for what it is.",3,"Enjoyable Movie, but this is the UK Dub and Characters' Names Have Been Changed!",1346198400,"08 29, 2012",2012,1954,"['Smurfs', 'Magic', 'Flute', 'was', 'directed', 'Smurfs', 'creator', 'Peyo', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', '1976', 'Belgium', '1979', 'United', 'Kingdom', '1981', 'NBC', 'aired', 'Smurfs', 'Hanna-Barbera', 'was', 'instant', 'success', 'English', 'dubbed', 'version', 'Smurfs', 'Magic', 'Flute', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'USA', '1983', 'being', 'disliked', 'critics', 'move', 'was', 'box-office', 'success', 'years', 'been', 'only', 'available', 'VHS', 'never', 'DVD', 'now.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'young', 'squire', 'Johan', 'goofy', 'sidekick', 'Peewit', 'Peyo', 'created', 'characters', '1952', 'then', 'created', 'Smurfs', '1958', 'Peewit', 'hold', 'flute', 'only', 'six', 'holes', 'Whoever', 'playing', 'flute', 'can', 'control', 'other', 'people', 'making', 'dance.A', 'stranger', 'Matthew', 'McCreep', 'flute', 'Peewit', 'flute', 'rob', 'people', 'King', 'sends', 'Johan', 'Peewit', 'retrieve', 'flute', 'kingdom', 'may', 'fall', 'fail', 'first', 'attempt', 'get', 'flute', 'back', 'causing', 'seek', 'help', 'wizard', 'who', 'magically', 'Smurfland.Papa', 'Smurf', 'other', 'Smurfs', 'agree', 'make', 'new', 'flute', 'Smurfs', 'can', 'hand', 'flute', 'Johan', 'Peewit', 'are', 'zapped', 'back', 'world', 'Smurfs', 'journey', 'other', 'world', 'help', 'stop', 'McCreep', 'castle.Shout', 'Factory', 'brought', 'Smurfs', 'Magic', 'Flute', 'DVD', 'used', 'UK', 'Dubbed', 'version', 'not', 'English', 'Dubbed', 'version', 'odd', 'reason', 'voices', 'are', 'different', 'names', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'such', 'Peewit', 'now', 'William', 'Johan', 'now', 'John', 'picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'up', 'ending', 'are', 'few', 'extras', 'image', 'gallery', 'glossary', 'Smurf', 'terms', 'Smurf', 'Story', 'character', 'guide', 'etc.This', 'not', 'best', 'animated', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'forever', 'Smurf', 'actually', 'show', 'up', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Smurf', 'fans', 'new', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'appreciate', 'what']",Smurfs and the Magic Flute VHS

Ever since they saw theThe Smurfs (Two-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy), they have been hooked on the cartoon, so having this new movie to share with them just solidified their love of the little blue characters. The artistry of the film and the cartooning was amazing! Outside of the movie itself though the bonus features on this DVD were so much fun and you will leave watching them so much more ""in the know"" about Smurf lingo (my favorite) as well as character guide (a close #2) that will leave you knowing a bit about every smurf!

303796,AZP335D31XNA7,6302250161,RetroMan,"[6, 9]","So let's start by saying this is pre-80s Hanna Barbera mega popular Smurfs tv series material. It's a 1976 original Belgian film though the English version came over and was shown in the US in 1983 due to the Smurfs being so popular. So don't expect Papa Smurf or any of the other smurfs to have the same voice you're probably use to in the Hanna Barbera series. The first half of the movie is pretty much Johan and Peewit heavy. The story has already been summarized above so I'll move on to other details.The movie is about 70 mins, it's quite charming and has that European cartoon feel to it. The movie did feel rushed at the end, I think another good 10 or 20 mins could have really flushed out the story a little more and made it more satisfying. It felt like at the end just time to wrap up things like it was a television episode which was disappointing. On the plus side the picture is crisp and the colors pop and it seems like a decent job of remastering was done here BUT, and this is strange but the last 2 mins the picture goes from beautiful to some un-mastered grainy looking footage. I don't know how Shout Factory let this past but truth be known their standards have been dipping in recent times.On top of all this the dub is not the North American dub but the UK dub which has different names for characters, this is just a straight port of the Region 2 dvd, Shout Factory put no work into this, the aspect ratio is awful as well, old style letterbox. Shout Factory will defend itself saying they only distributed it but they knew it's for the North American market they could have added the NA track. Lazy indeed. All the people finding the negative reviews unhelpful must be big Shout Factory fans, c'mon we are just telling the truth. Isn't that what people want,honest reviews?The extras on here seem uninspired, most text based info (smurf terms, about the smurfs) that isn't that informative or entertaining, the font chosen especially makes it difficult to read, even if you've got great eye sight expect to be close to the screen to read the info and I was watching it on a big television.

In the story, one of the lead characters, Peewit the court minstrel, finds a six-holed flute that makes whoever listens to it dance to its tune, though extended playing causes them to pass out. A thief named Matthew McCreep finds out about this flute and steals it from Peewit so he can use it to rob the townsfolk of their valuables. Unable to stop him on their own, Johan and Peewit turn to Homnibus the enchanter, who transports them to the land of the Smurfs where they get help from them in the form of creating a second magic flute so they can retrieve the stolen first flute and return it to the Smurfs.The movie is fairly entertaining, though it is obviously made with children in mind due to the songs featured in it. The animation is decent, a little better than that of Hanna-Barbera. While none of the voice cast from the cartoon show did voices for any of the characters in this movie, there are some notable sound-alike versions of Frank Welker's Hefty and Bill Callaway's Clumsy that appear on different Smurf characters featured here. Still, I would rather listen to Don Messick doing Papa Smurf's voice (or Jonathan Winters in the 2011 movie, since Don is eternally unavailable) than the voice actor selected for his character.For what it's worth, the movie is recommended to any hardcore Smurf fan.
