Being of Irish descent and having attending an all-boys Catholic high school this movie hits home in a lot of places.  While it takes place a couple of decades before I was in school there is still a lot of truth to the scenes played out here.I've seen in some reviews that people complained about the language in this movie and all I can say is they must have missed the R rating on this one.  I can also tell you guys in Catholic schools do in fact swear, and swear a lot.&#34;Heaven Help Us&#34; is the story of a bunch of guys that go to St. Basil's Boys' Prep School in the '60's.  We get to see the pranks they pull, the punishment they receive when caught and how they react to one particular Brother who was a bit more violent than any Brother I'd ever run into.  The movie is a nice mixture of what goes on at school as well as the budding romance of the characters played by Andrew McCarthy and Mary Stuart Masterson.If you went to Catholic school you will probably love this movie as much as I did.

Know as `Catholic Boys' in the UK, I first watched this film on TV after initially never heard of it before.Even though the film is set in a Catholic school during the sixties, most people will relate to some of the characters in the film. It definitely reminded me of my time in school in England. You have Rooney (Kevin Dillon) as the bully, Brother Timothy (John Heard) as the teacher who can relate to the pupils during their strict upbringing, Brother Constance (Jay Patterson) as the teacher who rules by an iron fist. Also there is Donald Sutherland as the head teacher, Brother Thadeus, whom you would initially expect to be the nastiest of the monks, but in the end he is a nice guy, despite a slightly nutty, eccentric exterior.The film is really funny and really moving at times, the humour is perfectly balanced so it doesn't lighten the darker moments, such as the corporate punishment scenes.Heaven Help Us seems a forgotten movie, however itit has future stars laden in the cast, such as Patrick Dempsey and Yeardley Smith, who went on to do Lisa Simpson's voice. I think the film belongs to Kevin Dillon, as the hopeless Rooney. It is a shame that he hasn't been in more films like his brother has.A really touching and funny movie, forgotten maybe, but worth checking out if you have never seen it.I couldn't find this to buy in the uk so I had to purchase the region 1 version so if you buy this version outside the USA or Canada make sure you have a multi-region DVD player.5 stars.",5,Forgotten Gem...,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,1580,"['Great', 'coming', 'age', 'movie', 'set', 'Catholic', 'school', 'Brooklyn', '60s', 'Know', 'Catholic', 'Boys', 'UK', 'first', 'watched', 'film', 'TV', 'initially', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'set', 'Catholic', 'school', 'sixties', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'relate', 'characters', 'film', 'definitely', 'reminded', 'time', 'school', 'England', 'have', 'Rooney', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'bully', 'Brother', 'Timothy', 'John', 'Heard', 'teacher', 'who', 'can', 'relate', 'pupils', 'strict', 'upbringing', 'Brother', 'Constance', 'Jay', 'Patterson', 'teacher', 'who', 'rules', 'iron', 'fist', 'Also', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'head', 'teacher', 'Brother', 'Thadeus', 'whom', 'would', 'initially', 'expect', 'be', 'nastiest', 'monks', 'end', 'nice', 'guy', 'slightly', 'nutty', 'eccentric', 'exterior.The', 'film', 'really', 'funny', 'really', 'moving', 'times', 'humour', 'perfectly', 'balanced', ""n't"", 'lighten', 'darker', 'moments', 'such', 'corporate', 'punishment', 'scenes.Heaven', 'Help', 'Us', 'forgotten', 'movie', 'however', 'itit', 'future', 'stars', 'laden', 'cast', 'such', 'Patrick', 'Dempsey', 'Yeardley', 'Smith', 'who', 'went', 'do', 'Lisa', 'Simpson', 'voice', 'think', 'film', 'belongs', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'hopeless', 'Rooney', 'shame', ""n't"", 'been', 'more', 'films', 'brother', 'has.A', 'really', 'touching', 'funny', 'movie', 'forgotten', 'maybe', 'checking', 'out', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'it.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'buy', 'uk', 'so', 'had', 'purchase', 'region', '1', 'version', 'so', 'buy', 'version', 'USA', 'Canada', 'make', 'sure', 'have', 'multi-region', 'DVD', 'player.5', 'stars']",N/A

A story of friendship and first love.As a Catholic - still!- who grew up in the late fifties/early sixties, I have a personal connection with this lovely film. The first time I saw this I was a little offended (as a woman) but then it won me over, and I've since watched it a few times, and in fact given it to my teenage daughter who also loves it.  You can read the plot elsewhere, but Andrew McCarthy and Kevin Dillon do wonderful work in this film, as do all the people at St. Basil's, it's a VERY real location and everything about it rang true.This is a very funny film with a terrific soundtrack.

43286,A3FNOMJG1MKQYG,0783114664,O. Rios,"[1, 1]","Heaven Help Us actually had a very young up and coming all-star cast when it was made. Andrew McCarthy (Pretty in Pink and Weekend at Bernies), Donald Sutherland (Animal House, JFK), Patrick Dempsey (Grey's Anatomy), Kevin Dillon (Entourage), and John Heard (father from Home Alone).The film revolves around Michael Dunn (MCarthy), who lives with his sister and grandparents (parents are dead). He is attending St. Basills, a Catholic school. His grandparents want him to become a priest, possibly a bishop, and if they could have it their way, Pope.Dunn is new to the school when he is befriended by Ceasar, the chubby nerdy kid that Ed Rooney (Dillon) loves to pick on. Dillon is everything Cesar isn't. To complete the group, there is Williams, a pervert but good natured kid, and Corbett (Dempsey).Dunn, through trial by fire is offered friendship by Rooney after the two get into a fight. Rooney likes and respects Dunn for not ratting him out to the Brothers (teachers) regarding a broken chair where Rooney took apart all the screws so that Cesar could fall down. They become friends and through cleverness and perhaps fate, Rooney starts to be friends with Cesar though the occassion jabbing at him.The group hangs out at a local joint where they drink sodas, smoke cigarettes, and listen to the music of 1960s (movie takes place in 1965). Occassionally, they are forced to bolt the hangout because of local brothers raiding the joint to bust everybody who is smoking and not acting accordingly.The group hangs out and all become best friends with all one common purpose, none of them want to become priests. This bond helps them unite and become best friends and in the end, their friendship is even more solidified when one of the brothers, who loves to discipline them through physical violence, goes to far, setting off a chain reaction that only cements the bonds of their friendship.Overall, the movie is awesome. I had never scene it, but i'm glad i did. It's funny, nice, and neat to see the bonds of frienship develop from the beginning to end.

The kids who attend this school, have to deal with ridiculously strict teachers, who are all church elders. The teachers walk around in long brown robes, and have haircuts like monks. Naturally, the boys find clever ways to rebel against their school's stifling regulations, and are constantly getting into mischief.Back in the mid-60s corporal punishment was still common in all schools, not just Catholic ones. The difference in this film, is that the teachers try to use Catholic religious values, to justify their harsh punitive treatment of the students. One teacher in particular, is very sadistic whenever he wants to punish his pupils. He locks them in a closet, viciously whips their hands with a wooden paddle, slaps them, pulls their hair, ETC.When a group of boys vandalize a statue, the sadistic teacher tries to paddle their behinds with a gigantic wooden paddle. This is the last straw for the boys, who are fed-up with being brutally disciplined by this teacher. And they decide to take matters into their own hands. This is a good film overall, about 60s teens. It was very realistic, in showing the life that urban teens led in that era. By showing how barbaric corporal punishment was back then, this movie can make the viewer glad that it's been abolished in schools nowadays.I can only imagine how many kids who were in school in the 60s, have been psychologically damaged by getting beaten by their teachers. Since they had to cope with this, it's no wonder that most young people growing-up during the 60s, vehemently rebelled against authority.",4,Realistic film about 60s urban teens.,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,1666,"['film', 'place', 'mid-60s', 'Brooklyn', 'fascist-like', 'Catholic', 'school', 'boys', 'kids', 'who', 'attend', 'school', 'have', 'deal', 'ridiculously', 'strict', 'teachers', 'who', 'are', 'church', 'elders', 'teachers', 'walk', 'long', 'brown', 'robes', 'have', 'haircuts', 'monks', 'Naturally', 'boys', 'find', 'clever', 'ways', 'rebel', 'school', 'stifling', 'regulations', 'are', 'constantly', 'getting', 'mischief.Back', 'mid-60s', 'corporal', 'punishment', 'was', 'still', 'common', 'schools', 'not', 'just', 'Catholic', 'ones', 'difference', 'film', 'teachers', 'try', 'use', 'Catholic', 'religious', 'values', 'justify', 'harsh', 'punitive', 'treatment', 'students', 'One', 'teacher', 'particular', 'very', 'sadistic', 'whenever', 'punish', 'pupils', 'closet', 'viciously', 'hands', 'wooden', 'paddle', 'hair', 'ETC.When', 'group', 'boys', 'vandalize', 'statue', 'sadistic', 'teacher', 'tries', 'paddle', 'behinds', 'gigantic', 'wooden', 'paddle', 'last', 'straw', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'fed-up', 'being', 'brutally', 'disciplined', 'teacher', 'decide', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'good', 'film', 'overall', 'about', '60s', 'teens', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'showing', 'life', 'urban', 'teens', 'led', 'era', 'showing', 'how', 'barbaric', 'corporal', 'punishment', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'viewer', 'glad', 'been', 'abolished', 'schools', 'nowadays.I', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'many', 'kids', 'who', 'were', 'school', '60s', 'have', 'been', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'getting', 'beaten', 'teachers', 'had', 'cope', 'wonder', 'most', 'young', 'people', 'growing-up', '60s', 'vehemently', 'rebelled', 'authority']",N/A
