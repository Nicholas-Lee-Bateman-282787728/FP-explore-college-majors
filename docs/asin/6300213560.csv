207912,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6300213560,Charles Ashbacher,"[1, 2]","This episode could have been subtitled, ""Nazis in Space."" Unlike episode 43, ""Bread and Circuses"" and episode 54 ""The Omega Glory"" where the encounters with circumstances drawn from Earth's historical record was homegrown, the Nazi movement was imposed by a Federation official. John Gill is a historian who previously taught at Star Fleet Academy and is now a cultural observer on the planet Ekos. While on a routine mission to make contact with Gill, the Enterprise is attacked by chemical rockets bearing nuclear warheads.Kirk and Spock beam down to the planet and discover that the planet is now ruled by Nazis and Gill is the Fuhrer. In this case, their hatred is directed against the inhabitants of Zeon, another planet in the solar system that possesses rudimentary space travel. Kirk and Spock are captured, tortured, imprisoned, befriend an imprisoned Zeon and penetrate the Nazi headquarters. They learn that Gill intervened in the culture, starting the Nazi movement because Ekos was politically fragmented and in his words, ""Nazi Germany was the most efficient society in history."" However, while the strategy worked at first, Gill was then drugged by his second in command and the movement was usurped into one of hatred against Zeon to the point of brutal persecution and murder. McCoy is beamed down and with his help, they are able to get Gill to make an announcement calling off the campaign of hatred. Gill is killed after making the speech along with his second in command.This is one of the most ridiculous of all Star Trek episodes, based on some of the worst premises. They are:*) Nazi Germany was not the most efficient state in human history. No intelligent historian would ever make that claim. Under their rule, Germany suffered the greatest brain-drain ever to take place in modern times.*) The Nazi movement was based solely on a campaign of hatred of all not of ""pure"" German extraction. Beyond that, there was little else, so it would be impossible to separate the persecution from the other aspects. Again, no intelligent historian would make the attempt.*) Gill was a member of Star Fleet and bound by the prime directive, a vow that he would not easily break.Therefore, this is a combination of events that are impossible, even within the realm of Star Trek.Furthermore, the events are not carried out very well. Kirk and Spock have no difficulty penetrating the most secure areas of the party, hardly something that could occur in a Nazi state. Spock and the Zeon they befriended pose as members of a news crew to obtain entrance to the secure building, yet both wear helmets and no one notices Spock's slanted eyebrows or the presence of the Zeon. All members of the military would be wearing their dress uniforms, which does not include helmets and members of a culture as race conscious as Ekos would not fail to notice those of an inferior race.Finally, you do have to give the producers some credit for being willing to use such a controversial subject as Nazi Germany in the show. As I understand it, this episode has never aired in Germany. When I watch it, I always note the resemblance between the Nazi party leader who takes over at the end and Rudolph Hess, who was the number three man in the German Nazi hierarchy. It was an excellent bit of casting and makeup. Nevertheless, these are small points in favor and I rank this show in the lower fifteen of the original series.",2,Based on an inaccurate interpretation of history,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,3420,"['episode', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'subtitled', 'Nazis', 'Space', 'episode', '43', 'Bread', 'Circuses', 'episode', '54', 'Omega', 'Glory', 'where', 'encounters', 'circumstances', 'drawn', 'Earth', 'historical', 'record', 'was', 'homegrown', 'Nazi', 'movement', 'was', 'imposed', 'Federation', 'official', 'John', 'Gill', 'historian', 'who', 'previously', 'taught', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'Academy', 'now', 'cultural', 'observer', 'planet', 'Ekos', 'routine', 'mission', 'make', 'contact', 'Gill', 'Enterprise', 'attacked', 'chemical', 'rockets', 'bearing', 'nuclear', 'warheads.Kirk', 'Spock', 'beam', 'down', 'planet', 'discover', 'planet', 'now', 'ruled', 'Nazis', 'Gill', 'Fuhrer', 'case', 'hatred', 'directed', 'inhabitants', 'Zeon', 'planet', 'solar', 'system', 'rudimentary', 'space', 'travel', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'are', 'captured', 'tortured', 'imprisoned', 'befriend', 'imprisoned', 'Zeon', 'penetrate', 'Nazi', 'headquarters', 'learn', 'Gill', 'intervened', 'culture', 'starting', 'Nazi', 'movement', 'Ekos', 'was', 'politically', 'fragmented', 'words', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'was', 'most', 'efficient', 'society', 'history', 'However', 'strategy', 'worked', 'first', 'Gill', 'was', 'then', 'drugged', 'second', 'command', 'movement', 'was', 'usurped', 'one', 'hatred', 'Zeon', 'point', 'brutal', 'persecution', 'murder', 'McCoy', 'beamed', 'down', 'help', 'are', 'able', 'get', 'Gill', 'make', 'announcement', 'calling', 'off', 'campaign', 'hatred', 'Gill', 'killed', 'making', 'speech', 'second', 'command.This', 'one', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episodes', 'based', 'worst', 'premises', 'are', '*', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'was', 'not', 'most', 'efficient', 'state', 'human', 'history', 'intelligent', 'historian', 'would', 'ever', 'make', 'claim', 'rule', 'Germany', 'suffered', 'greatest', 'brain-drain', 'ever', 'take', 'place', 'modern', 'times', '*', 'Nazi', 'movement', 'was', 'based', 'solely', 'campaign', 'hatred', 'not', 'pure', 'German', 'extraction', 'Beyond', 'was', 'little', 'else', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'separate', 'persecution', 'other', 'aspects', 'Again', 'intelligent', 'historian', 'would', 'make', 'attempt', '*', 'Gill', 'was', 'member', 'Star', 'Fleet', 'bound', 'prime', 'directive', 'vow', 'would', 'not', 'easily', 'break.Therefore', 'combination', 'events', 'are', 'impossible', 'even', 'realm', 'Star', 'Trek.Furthermore', 'events', 'are', 'not', 'carried', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'have', 'difficulty', 'penetrating', 'most', 'secure', 'areas', 'party', 'hardly', 'something', 'could', 'occur', 'Nazi', 'state', 'Spock', 'Zeon', 'befriended', 'pose', 'members', 'news', 'crew', 'obtain', 'entrance', 'secure', 'building', 'yet', 'wear', 'helmets', 'one', 'Spock', 'slanted', 'eyebrows', 'presence', 'Zeon', 'members', 'military', 'would', 'be', 'wearing', 'dress', 'uniforms', 'not', 'include', 'helmets', 'members', 'culture', 'race', 'conscious', 'Ekos', 'would', 'not', 'fail', 'notice', 'inferior', 'race.Finally', 'do', 'have', 'give', 'producers', 'credit', 'being', 'willing', 'use', 'such', 'controversial', 'subject', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'show', 'understand', 'episode', 'never', 'aired', 'Germany', 'When', 'watch', 'always', 'note', 'resemblance', 'Nazi', 'party', 'leader', 'who', 'over', 'end', 'Rudolph', 'Hess', 'who', 'was', 'number', 'three', 'man', 'German', 'Nazi', 'hierarchy', 'was', 'excellent', 'bit', 'casting', 'makeup', 'Nevertheless', 'are', 'small', 'points', 'favor', 'rank', 'show', 'lower', 'fifteen', 'original', 'series']","Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 52: Patterns of Force VHS"

207914,ARAD4HTWWN2KZ,6300213560,Lokai,"[0, 1]","This episode is offensive on so many levels I don't know where to begin. I am surprised that so many people like this episode because it is in such poor taste. First off, I am a historian. I was insulted by the fact that the writers had a prominent Starfleet historian introduce Nazism on an alien planet. ""Even historians fail to learn from history"". True, but every historian should know that recreating a Nazi state anywhere would be ludicrous. I don't care if Professor Gill didn't include the anti-Semitic elements of Nazi Germany. This fact does not suddenly make the episode acceptable to Jewish viewers, including myself. I would never base an alien society even on a pro-Semitic Nazi Germany because the state was a failure! Gill explained himself by saying Nazi Germany was the ""most efficient state."" Please! The Nazi Party brought destruction to Germany after promising to make the country great. Nazi Germany is the best example of how to ruin your country and get your butt kicked by the world. Therefore, a Nazi Germany that is not anti-Semitic would still be an abysmal failure. The Second Season overdid it with Earth parallels.As a result, I believe that the episode is offensive to Jews. The Holocaust is a touchy subject that the writers did not handle with extreme care. Instead, we have Kirk, Spock, and McCoy laughing on the bridge after thousands of Zeons had been slaughtered. This is something that should only be in a Mel Brook's movie. How could they do this only 23 years after the end of the Holocaust?
