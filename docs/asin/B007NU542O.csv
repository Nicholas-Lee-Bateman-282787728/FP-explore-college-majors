1535102,A2NRLOUOQGGCB0,B007NU542O,Dante,"[2, 5]","I am a huge fan of the Tales of Vesperia video game so I was excited when this animated feature was released.  Sadly, it did not live up to my expectations.The movie plays more like a generic anime than it does a spin-off of the ToV game.  The story is dull and unengaging, making it a chore to watch.  The main cast of characters is not true to its original video game conception.  Rita is no longer an energetic and temperamental blastia researcher, but rather a sleepy and apathetic informer used as a plot device.  Raven is not a comical lech, but a shadowy and unremarkable guild lackey.  Yuri and Flynn have noticeably darker personalities than their original designs.  Their relationship seems more like a bitter antagonism than it does a rivalry based on mutually respected, if differing, views of the world.  There are some new generic characters tossed in as well, but they are unoriginal and easily forgotten.The whole movie is leans towards a darker and more violent storytelling direction, but without any of the depth or philosophical intelligence that should accompany a more serious drama.  It's also disappointing to see that the animation is no better than an anime one might have watched a decade or two ago.  Given that the video game was so bold and colorful, this movie seems archaic by comparison.",2,Very Disappointing,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",2013,1320,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Tales', 'Vesperia', 'video', 'game', 'so', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'animated', 'feature', 'was', 'released', 'Sadly', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations.The', 'movie', 'more', 'generic', 'anime', 'spin-off', 'ToV', 'game', 'story', 'dull', 'unengaging', 'making', 'chore', 'watch', 'main', 'cast', 'characters', 'not', 'true', 'original', 'video', 'game', 'conception', 'Rita', 'no', 'longer', 'energetic', 'temperamental', 'blastia', 'researcher', 'rather', 'sleepy', 'apathetic', 'informer', 'used', 'plot', 'device', 'Raven', 'not', 'comical', 'lech', 'shadowy', 'unremarkable', 'guild', 'lackey', 'Yuri', 'Flynn', 'have', 'noticeably', 'darker', 'personalities', 'original', 'designs', 'relationship', 'more', 'bitter', 'antagonism', 'rivalry', 'based', 'mutually', 'respected', 'differing', 'views', 'world', 'are', 'new', 'generic', 'characters', 'tossed', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'unoriginal', 'easily', 'forgotten.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'leans', 'towards', 'darker', 'more', 'violent', 'storytelling', 'direction', 'depth', 'philosophical', 'intelligence', 'should', 'accompany', 'more', 'serious', 'drama', 'also', 'disappointing', 'see', 'animation', 'better', 'anime', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'watched', 'decade', 'two', 'Given', 'video', 'game', 'was', 'so', 'bold', 'colorful', 'movie', 'archaic', 'comparison']",N/A

1535104,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B007NU542O,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","In 2008, ""Tales of Vesperia"", the tenth ""Tales"" title from Namco Tales Studio was released for the XBOX 360 in Japan and the United States.  Produced by Yoshito Higuchi (""Tales of Symphonia"", ""Tales of the Abyss""), featuring designs by Kosuke Fujishima and featuring a theme song (""Ring a Bell/Kane wo Narashite"") by Bonnie Pink.The video game would revolve around the character Yuri Lowell, a former Knight, who meets a young girl named Estelle searching for his childhood friend/rival Flynn.  In the video game, both young men noticed the corruption within the empire and Yuri, always taking action before thinking, sets out to take matters into his own hands, while the dedicated knight, Flynn, wants to change the Empire from within. And because of their opposing views, the rivalry between both men continues to intensify.While the video game would showcase the relationship between the friends, Yuri and Flynn, there is not much known of why these two friends have such a rivalry.And thus, to explain that rivalry and their origin, the animated film ""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" was created by Production I.G and released in theaters in Japan in 1999.""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" was directed by Kenta Kamei (""Bunny Drop"", ""Starship Girl Yamamoto"", ""Kuroko's Baseball""), written by Reiko Yoshida (""Bakuman"", ""Aria the Natural"", ""Dragon Ball Z"", ""Getbackers""), music by Akira Senju (""Red Garden"", ""Silent Service"", ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood""), character designs by Tokuyuki Matsutake (""Medabots"", ""You're Under Arrest TV"") and art direction by Hiroshi Ohno (""Akira"", ""Le Chevalier D'Eon"", ""Natsuki Crisis"", ""Nine"").VIDEO:""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and is HD native.  As the film is produced by Production I.G., for those familiar with the company know they are dedicated to quality.  Best known for their beautiful art backgrounds, ""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" is an animated film that manages to keep the look of the ""Tales of Vesperia"" videogame when it comes to character design but also manages to bring in that very detailed look that Production I.G. is known for.Beautiful lush backgrounds, detailed scenery... it's what I expect from Production I.G. and they deliver.  Black levels are nice and deep,  I detected no banding or any artifacts.  ""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" looks great on Blu-ray and for those who enjoyed the ""Tales of Vesperia"" video game or fans of action adventure anime, will definitely enjoy the overall look of this animated film.AUDIO:""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" is presented in Dolby TrueHD English and Japanese 5.1.  Because the film does feature quite a bit of action, the film definitely utilizes the surround channels for ambiance but also for the major action sequences from explosions or during battle.  There is a good amount of LFE during those action sequences and overall the lossless soundtrack is very good for this animated film.  As for the voice acting, both are well done but I did notice that for the English version, FUNimation opted for voice actors (for the characters of Yuri and Flynn)  that sound older than their Japanese counterpart.  But both vocal soundtracks are well-acted!Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" comes with the following special features:Promotional Footage Collection - (8:28) The promotional video for ""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"".Picture Sound  - (3:24) A musical feature showcasing the art of ""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"".U.S. Trailer - (1:34) Official FUNimation trailer for ""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"".Previews - FUNimation Entertainment and BioWare trailersEXTRAS:""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" comes with a slipcover case.JUDGMENT CALL:As a fan and collector of the ""Tales"" series, I have been following the game since it was first released.With each release, you pretty much know that you're going to get an epic tale and be introduced to a wonderful group of characters.But with ""Tales of Vesperia"", the video game was among the few Japanese RPG titles released in the United States that collector's were excited about because it was one of the first RPG collector's series to be released in America.  Granted, back then it was a metal case and a soundtrack but for fans of the series, ""Tales of Vesperia"" was a ""Tales"" game that many people purchased or is still being sought after by collectors today.And for those who had the opportunity to play the game, the storyline was of the RPG was captivating especially when it came to the rivalry amongst friends/rivals Yuri Lowell and Flynn Scifo.But with all that was featured in the video game, you knew that these two characters had some major back-story and sure enough, to showcase their history, Production I.G. created an anime series based on these two characters but also the the discussion of guilds, blastia and aer.While I haven't watched the four episode series of ""Tales of Symphonia"", I have watched and reviewed the anime series ""Tales of the Abyss"".  ""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" is rather interesting because it's a prequel and it is the first animated film that is based on an actual video game.And as much as I enjoyed the film, it is also somewhat of a caveat for western audiences who don't play video games.  Personally, I found ""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" to be accessible to any anime fan, if you have or haven't played the video games.  The reason being is that while Yuri and Flynn are showcased in the film, other characters are not in the video game.  The story was written in a way that anyone can watch it, without having knowledge of the video game and the fact that it's a prequel does help a lot.In fact, I'll also say that for an animated film inspired by a video game, ""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" is one of the better animated films that was created.  So, many animated films based on a video game stray too far from what people loved about the video game or has a storyline that is not well-planned.  Fortunately, """"Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" compliments the actual video game, so it was another reason why I enjoyed this film.As for the Blu-ray release, the animation for the film compliments the video game by its look and feel.  Production I.G. is my favorite anime studio because they emphasize detail for their art backgrounds and for the most part, they are known for their quality.  And ""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" looks and sounds great in HD.  While I did enjoy both English and Japanese soundtracks, I did notice that both Yuri and Flynn do sound much older than their Japanese counterparts in the film.  But regardless, both are well-done when it comes to voice acting.And while there are a few special features included, I was surprised that there were not featurettes promoting or linking the actual video game. It's something that you are used to seeing on anime releases with a video game tie-in.  But you do get a few special features and with the Blu-ray release, the additional DVD.""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" is a worthy prequel because it really goes into the history of Yuri and Flynn's rivalry and how both are friends but yet rivals with two different mentalities.  Yuri is headstrong and does what he feel is right, regardless of rules or regulations.  Flynn thinks before acting and follows the rules of the Knight.  And sure enough, viewers get to see why the two friends have this attitude towards each other from the video game to this animated prequel.  And also, you do get a few cool characters such as the commanding officer Niren Fedroc but also the fascinating twin sisters Hisca and Chastel Aiheap.  Also, you get to see more of Yuri's dog Repede when he was a puppy.Overall, whether or not you are a ""Tales"" fan or one who loved the ""Tales of Vesperia"" video game, if you are looking for an animated film with adventure and plenty of action, ""Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike"" is an animated film worth checking out.",4,"The animated prequel to the popular RPG game ""Tales of

1535111,AH5H0JNP3N25E,B007NU542O,ReonPremente,"[1, 1]","Taking a chance to see this movie on the Funimation Channel's Roku App, the movie is a detailed look at what events led up to the game's plot and intentions.  The world's magical power known only as Aer is somehow being corrupted and it's up to our heroes to figure out what is causing it.  A good 1 and a half hour film full of intrigue, betrayal and mystery with a great musical score and gorgeous animation with likable characters makes this movie quite enjoyable for all anime fans.A note to the people who have played the game, some of the characters are not in the game and/or act differently as this is 8 years place BEFORE the events of the game.  Repede DOES NOT carry a pipe in the movie, in fact he's quite young.  The twin sisters are (I believe) NOT in the game unless they are the multi-color haired girls you encounter later in the 360 game. Also Rita is much younger in the movie... and does not know nor does she follow Yuri.  Likewise when Flynn talks with Estelle in the movie, she is forbidden to leave with him to explore the reason for the Blastia/Aer connection that is corrupting the nearby wildlife.Also in the movie, we get to meet Repede's father and learn of his unfortunate demise something we never learned in the game... and first and foremost we learn the reason why Yuri HATES the Knights in the game and why Flynn and he are at odds with each other.  So basically it reveals a lot without revealing too much of what the game is about.  So if you're at all interested in the game, as I was, I'd highly recommend watching it.  It's done by the illustrious Production I.G. (Ghost in the Shell, The Sky Crawlers, Sakura Wars The Movie) and released by Funimation and anyone who loves the Tales game series and/or anime is in for a real treat with this film.  ^_^",4,A very good look at what the game is supposed to be about,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,1792,"['Taking', 'chance', 'see', 'movie', 'Funimation', 'Channel', 'Roku', 'App', 'movie', 'detailed', 'look', 'what', 'events', 'led', 'up', 'game', 'plot', 'intentions', 'world', 'magical', 'power', 'known', 'only', 'Aer', 'somehow', 'being', 'corrupted', 'up', 'heroes', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'causing', 'good', '1', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'full', 'intrigue', 'betrayal', 'mystery', 'great', 'musical', 'score', 'gorgeous', 'animation', 'likable', 'characters', 'movie', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'anime', 'fans.A', 'note', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'played', 'game', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'game', 'and/or', 'act', 'differently', '8', 'years', 'place', 'events', 'game', 'Repede', 'DOES', 'NOT', 'carry', 'pipe', 'movie', 'fact', 'quite', 'young', 'twin', 'sisters', 'are', 'believe', 'NOT', 'game', 'are', 'multi-color', 'haired', 'girls', 'encounter', 'later', '360', 'game', 'Also', 'Rita', 'much', 'younger', 'movie', 'not', 'know', 'follow', 'Yuri', 'Likewise', 'when', 'Flynn', 'talks', 'Estelle', 'movie', 'forbidden', 'leave', 'explore', 'reason', 'Blastia/Aer', 'connection', 'corrupting', 'nearby', 'wildlife.Also', 'movie', 'get', 'meet', 'Repede', 'father', 'learn', 'unfortunate', 'demise', 'something', 'never', 'learned', 'game', 'first', 'foremost', 'learn', 'reason', 'why', 'Yuri', 'Knights', 'game', 'why', 'Flynn', 'are', 'odds', 'other', 'basically', 'lot', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'game', 'about', 'So', ""'re"", 'interested', 'game', 'was', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'done', 'illustrious', 'Production', 'I.G', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'Sky', 'Crawlers', 'Sakura', 'Wars', 'Movie', 'released', 'Funimation', 'anyone', 'who', 'Tales', 'game', 'series', 'and/or', 'anime', 'real', 'treat', 'film', '^_^']",N/A

The movie storyline overall isn't that spectacular as it feels that the writers pretty much made the movie for what you feel it was for and that was give us the background on these characters and some information for the way they were in the game.  The animation fits the cut scenes from the game exactly which is very appreciated and the soundtrack fits nicely with the movie scenes as well.  With the exception of one or two dubbed voice cast it seems that the original actors/actresses from the game also came to do the voices of their characters in this movie as well again very appreciated.  While we didn't get a Japanese voice audio for the game the movie cast itself did a terrific job as expected.  While anyone would probably find this movie entertaining it seem obvious that it was directed towards the fans of the game more then anything else, but don't let that make people overlook this entertaining movie still.",5,Entertaining Look At The Early Years Of Some Of Our Beloved Characters From The Game,1347494400,"09 13, 2012",2012,1116,"[""'ve"", 'played', 'game', 'Tales', 'Vesperia', 'new', 'movie', 'great', 'choice', 'dvd', 'collection', 'more', 'information', 'early', 'days', 'few', 'characters', 'game', 'movie', 'storyline', 'overall', ""n't"", 'that', 'spectacular', 'writers', 'pretty', 'much', 'made', 'movie', 'what', 'feel', 'was', 'was', 'give', 'background', 'characters', 'information', 'way', 'were', 'game', 'animation', 'cut', 'scenes', 'game', 'exactly', 'very', 'appreciated', 'soundtrack', 'nicely', 'movie', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'exception', 'one', 'two', 'dubbed', 'voice', 'cast', 'original', 'actors/actresses', 'game', 'also', 'came', 'do', 'voices', 'characters', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'again', 'very', 'appreciated', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'audio', 'game', 'movie', 'cast', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'expected', 'anyone', 'would', 'probably', 'find', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'seem', 'obvious', 'was', 'directed', 'fans', 'game', 'more', 'then', 'anything', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'make', 'people', 'overlook', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'still']",N/A
