I LOVE the guild and this is fantastic with TWO music videos.  Would you like to date my Avatar, and Game On.  Lots of outtakes and hilarious extras.  The Guild are proving you don't need to be on TV to be a great show!  I already own seasons 1,2,and 3.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who plays MMORPGs or just likes to play video games.

1389514,A2E16NM4CZ1N66,B0049MTTH0,"Matt Conner ""psychiatrist""","[0, 2]","I have loved The Guild since season 1, delighting in the way the series demonstrates a love for the misfits who can find meaning online.  Unfortunately, as the budget has improved, the show has added high-quality guest stars like Wil Wheaton and Simon Helberg.  This only emphasizes the low level of talent in some of the original cast, most notably Robin Thorsen.  Her lines are still wonderfully funny, but her delivery still sounds like she has to pause to remember her line, then spit it out as fast as she can before she forgets, then giggle and roll her eyes and wait her turn to go again.  The character is still great for moving the drama, but if the show is going to keep improving along the trend of its popularity and budget, the writer needs to start applying some of the obvious talent toward finding a way to address an actress who is loveable but out of her league.  Overall, another great season for this show and well worth the investment of time and money.",4,A dip in quality but still good,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,974,"['have', 'loved', 'Guild', 'season', '1', 'delighting', 'way', 'series', 'love', 'misfits', 'who', 'can', 'find', 'meaning', 'online', 'Unfortunately', 'budget', 'improved', 'show', 'added', 'high-quality', 'guest', 'stars', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'Simon', 'Helberg', 'only', 'low', 'level', 'talent', 'original', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'Robin', 'Thorsen', 'lines', 'are', 'still', 'wonderfully', 'funny', 'delivery', 'still', 'pause', 'remember', 'line', 'then', 'spit', 'out', 'as', 'fast', 'can', 'then', 'giggle', 'roll', 'eyes', 'wait', 'turn', 'go', 'again', 'character', 'still', 'great', 'moving', 'drama', 'show', 'going', 'keep', 'improving', 'trend', 'popularity', 'budget', 'writer', 'start', 'applying', 'obvious', 'talent', 'finding', 'way', 'address', 'actress', 'who', 'loveable', 'league', 'Overall', 'great', 'season', 'show', 'well', 'investment', 'time', 'money']",N/A
