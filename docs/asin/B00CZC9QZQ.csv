From the hilarious theme song (which now haunts my dreams!), to the goofy humans, and the title creature itself, this is pure retro-50s-sci-fi entertainment.  Mihm gets everything right, including the stolid, scientist eggheads and the use of military stock footage! This is a must for all lovers of &#34;big bug&#34; films, as well as those who enjoy monster parody / homage movies.

Sadly, it was not what I thought. Although the spider effects are great, even the goofy animatronic spider face, the movie is a huge let down. Hated, hated, hated most of the atrocious acting and dialogue. Sorry, but in most of the 1950s monster movies, the actors at least took the material seriously.I think the intention is there, the execution is a let down.I loaned my copy to a few friends, they agreed with me.",3,Not what I thought......,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,532,"['read', 'several', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'How', 'nostalgic', 'was', 'So', 'blindly', 'ordered', 'asap', 'Sadly', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'thought', 'spider', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'even', 'goofy', 'animatronic', 'spider', 'face', 'movie', 'huge', 'let', 'down', 'Hated', 'hated', 'hated', 'most', 'atrocious', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'Sorry', 'most', '1950s', 'monster', 'movies', 'actors', 'least', 'took', 'material', 'seriously.I', 'think', 'intention', 'there', 'execution', 'let', 'down.I', 'loaned', 'copy', 'few', 'friends', 'agreed']",The Giant Spider
1652826,AWOY8WPL84PIB,B00CZC9QZQ,JP Fish,"[0, 0]","In the fifties and early sixties the teenagers all popped gum and made out at the drive inns watching movies like Tarantula and Black Scorpion. Stock characters included the young couple in love, the heroic scientist, maybe a teacher, a bumbling law man, and the rest of the cast from Gilligan's Island. The effects were special, in that they were outlandish and impossible, like their comic book simple scripts.  But what was most special was the talent that went into making those films.  The directors and technicians, as well as the budding actors were consummate professionals working against all odds to make a good movie. Maybe not Ben Hur. But something good enough to sell so they could earn some more money and do it all again.This kind of GREASE Goes To The Monster Movies is a sad cynical slam at these old films, counterfeiting what was good about them and then punishing the audience with bad acting and worse writing done in the name of satire. Mel Brooks did it all with Young Frankenstein already. And everyone involved was a master of their field. The Giant Spider showed use some clever technical effects that looked ""fifties but better"" just the way it was supposed to. Beyond that, it was a shallow debacle with any real talent buried in misguided or incompetent leadership. It is impossible to pawn off bad film making as comedy. Just because a film is cheap, or worse, cheap looking, it will not be funny.  There was nothing funny about the cover art that promised us so little, yet delivered nothing at all. Yet, it is said that ""no one tries to make a bad movie.""  That is not true.Troma is a company that has built it's reputation on a history of producing shamelessly tasteless, bad movies. They take pride in making some of the worst movies ever released. The simple fact is there is only one fatal flaw to create bad movies. They must never be boring in any part. To achieve that they must be entertaining. Troma accomplishes this by being crass,insensitive,sexist,crude,offensive,graphic,comically cheap and visually outlandish. But they are never flaccid,or boring. The secret is, they are un-apologetically entertaining. This is very deliberate and expertly done. They are successful because they are very good at being trashy movies. The audiences can always tell when all the ingredients are there, no matter how bad the stew might taste. An amateur can make a treasure look like tinsel, and a master can turn cellophane into gold. We love to see gold as long as it doesn't ""look fake'.There really is no difference between today's audience and the audiences of times gone by. It doesn't matter what the marketers say about who is jaded and more educated and how they should be elated in stead of frustrated. In fact the new movies that are being haled as new classics are just like those that have worn the crown for decades. They are called Classics because they are great movies! And they are great, primarily, because they are entertaining. OK, Great is rare. Good shouldn't be that hard to find.  Should it?  The best thing about this film is the cover art on the box. And I sought out this movie.  I looked forward to the time I would finally get to view this inspired retro-gem. By the end I felt robbed.  So, be warned.",2,"Well,  the spider was big alright.
