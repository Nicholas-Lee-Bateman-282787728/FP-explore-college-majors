More than once I changed television channels.  However, a more greater authority than me urged me to stick with watching her inspite of my unwillingness.  When she talked on the subject of spiritual warfare, via Battlefields of the Mind, she struck a homerun & touchdown with me.  I needed to hear that message.  I was so impressed I purchased the book and the DVD.  She has the gift of not only great oratory, but a tremendous amount of common sense derived from hard fought experience which she is able to get across to her Middle Class audiences.  If you do not have a clear mind's eye about spiritual warfare & how the devil tempts you, this would be a very helpful companion to the Holy Bible.",5,Male ego vs Meyer,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",2012,918,"['had', 'overcome', 'few', 'things', 'even', 'listen', 'Mrs.', 'Meyer', 'such', 'being', 'taught', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'preaching', 'Gospel', 'direct', 'spiritual', 'tap', 'knuckles', 'approach', 'bringing', 'up', 'contraversial', 'subjects', 'More', 'once', 'changed', 'television', 'channels', 'However', 'more', 'greater', 'authority', 'urged', 'stick', 'watching', 'inspite', 'unwillingness', 'When', 'talked', 'subject', 'spiritual', 'warfare', 'Battlefields', 'Mind', 'struck', 'homerun', 'touchdown', 'needed', 'hear', 'message', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'purchased', 'book', 'DVD', 'gift', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'oratory', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'common', 'sense', 'derived', 'hard', 'fought', 'experience', 'able', 'get', 'Middle', 'Class', 'audiences', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'clear', 'mind', 'eye', 'spiritual', 'warfare', 'how', 'devil', 'tempts', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'helpful', 'companion', 'Holy', 'Bible']",Battlefield of the Mind

It is terrific to use alone or with the book or a study guide.The DVD is 214 total minutes, broken up into four teachings around 50 minutes each.Teaching titles are:* What's Been on Your Mind Lately?* Thinking Your Way Out of Bondage* What Would Jesus Think?* Think About What You Are Thinking AboutJoyce Meyer appeals to a wide audience because she laughs at herself and is vulnerable in front of the camera.  She has been distracted in her mind and has been curt with people and done other sins just like the rest of us.  She isn't preaching down to anyone, and makes the subject very clear and easy to learn or follow.She does not preach only to women, and does not put down men or anyone in order to look better herself.  This is a great series to view and review more than once a year to remind yourself and check yourself on where your thoughts are leading you.  One of her favorite sayings about this study series is, ""where the mind goes, the man (person) follows.""This is the first series of hers that I have watched, and I highly recommend it for all ages.  Good for studying alone or as a group.  Great for teaching teens (and anyone) how to control their minds and thoughts and not just be controlled by what's outside--TV, ipods, texting, video games, what others say.  She helps you laugh at yourself as you learn to be still and think thoughts on purpose.

This has brought her joy and in this DVD she has much wisdom to share. She talks about how we should not just let our minds run rampant and that we should choose thoughts carefully.This DVD is essential viewing if you have trouble with your thoughts, especially negative thoughts about yourself or other people. Joyce Meyer explains how we are poisoning ourselves with jealousy, criticism and judging others. She also talks a bit about anger and explains the way to stop thinking bad thoughts.If you are looking to transform yourself this is a good place to start. I know what Joyce Meyer says is true because thinking positively had helped me tremendously in my life as well. What I loved about this DVD is that everything Joyce Meyer talks about is based on biblical truths.
