I watched this over a week ago and I cannot stop thinking of different possible answers, yet the storyline isn't that complicated. I loved the actors, for such a young age, they all did an excellent job. This film is set in a park with lots of beautiful green scenery.There is a suspenseful and dark tone to this film like something awful is going to happen, however, the end result is something that I didn't expect. I loved the eerie feel of the outdoor wall lights attached to the trees along the path that the older girls walked on at night. My favorite scene is when the schoolgirls are dancing, swinging, and playing in the forest with classical music in the background, it really reminded me of my childhood, where you simply enjoyed playing with no drama or tension.

952199,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000BX6FW8,Artist & Author,"[14, 22]","If there is a plot to this movie, my wife and I missed it.  However, it does have the capacity to keep one fascinated with the movie, always hoping that something by the end will tie everything together to make watching it a satisfying experience.  There are just too many unanswered aspects of this movie to make it seem to have been worth watching as far as 'story' goes.  The first question is how and why are the girls chosen to go to the 'school.'  My wife kept wondering why no parents ever seemed to show any concern about their daughter.  Could it be that each class was groomed for perfection for one to be chosen for some pagan human sacrifice at puberty?  We never know.  So, we are left to wonder for what purpose such a school existed.It also seemed a bit curious to me that the girls always seemed to wear their panties, even in the bathroom scenes and when they went swimming in the lake.  I'm old enough to remember when the YMCA required all the boys to swim naked if they used the pool.  In an all-girl, little girl, setting such as this school, it would seem that nudity would be natural.  [There is one scene where 12-year-old Bianca gets out of the tub and you see her fully naked reflection in the mirror; but she is alone.]  For a movie entitled 'Innocence' it seemed interesting that the ultimate prepubescent innocence was avoided.At the end of the movie, the oldest girls are taken by train to Paris.  We never know why.  For the first time in years the girls observe children laughing and playing like normal kids, a stark contrast to the almost militaristic lives they've led. We don't know from the story if this is just a 'field trip' or if the older women had just left them to fend for themselves.  Whatever the reason, the girls soon 'revert' from their picture-perfect selves to normal kids.  Is the message of the movie that, underneath, kids are really children no matter how regimented adults make their lives?  I would not presume to make any such judgments for you; you'll just have to watch the movie and try to figure out what, if any, meaning it has.",4,What's the Story Here?,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,2092,"['plot', 'movie', 'wife', 'missed', 'However', 'have', 'capacity', 'keep', 'one', 'fascinated', 'movie', 'always', 'hoping', 'something', 'end', 'will', 'tie', 'everything', 'together', 'make', 'watching', 'satisfying', 'experience', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'unanswered', 'aspects', 'movie', 'make', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'watching', 'as', 'far', ""'story"", 'first', 'question', 'how', 'why', 'are', 'girls', 'chosen', 'go', ""'school"", 'wife', 'kept', 'wondering', 'why', 'parents', 'ever', 'seemed', 'show', 'concern', 'daughter', 'Could', 'be', 'class', 'was', 'groomed', 'perfection', 'one', 'be', 'chosen', 'pagan', 'human', 'sacrifice', 'puberty', 'never', 'know', 'So', 'are', 'left', 'wonder', 'what', 'purpose', 'school', 'existed.It', 'also', 'seemed', 'bit', 'curious', 'girls', 'always', 'seemed', 'wear', 'panties', 'even', 'bathroom', 'scenes', 'when', 'went', 'swimming', 'lake', ""'m"", 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'when', 'YMCA', 'required', 'boys', 'swim', 'naked', 'used', 'pool', 'all-girl', 'little', 'girl', 'setting', 'such', 'school', 'would', 'seem', 'nudity', 'would', 'be', 'natural', '[', 'one', 'scene', 'where', '12-year-old', 'Bianca', 'tub', 'see', 'fully', 'naked', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'alone', ']', 'movie', 'entitled', ""'Innocence"", 'seemed', 'interesting', 'ultimate', 'prepubescent', 'innocence', 'was', 'end', 'movie', 'oldest', 'girls', 'are', 'taken', 'train', 'Paris', 'never', 'know', 'why', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'girls', 'observe', 'children', 'laughing', 'playing', 'normal', 'kids', 'stark', 'contrast', 'almost', 'militaristic', 'lives', ""'ve"", 'led', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'just', ""'field"", 'trip', 'older', 'women', 'had', 'just', 'left', 'fend', 'reason', 'girls', 'soon', ""'revert"", 'picture-perfect', 'selves', 'normal', 'kids', 'message', 'movie', 'underneath', 'kids', 'are', 'really', 'children', 'matter', 'how', 'regimented', 'adults', 'make', 'lives', 'would', 'not', 'presume', 'make', 'such', 'judgments', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'meaning']",Innocence Region 2

952205,A17CLOUQRVY0OX,B000BX6FW8,Kit van Cleave,"[14, 22]","German expressionist writer Frank Wedekind's symbolist novella ""Mini-Haha: The Corporal Education of Young Girls"" (1888) is the basis for this film, directed by Lucile Hadzihalilovic.  It takes place in a girls' school for affluent students, who arrive in a coffin, one by one, and who are not allowed to leave. (Anyone who tries to leave has to stay there forever, and become one of the old women who are servants to the current girls.) Marion Cotillard plays one of the two teachers, Eva, a ballet teacher; she is often moved to tears. The other teacher is a science teacher, who has a limp.  The girls are always dressed in white. Is this beginning to sound like a dream sequence to you? The girls wear colored ribbons to denote their seniority; some of the older girls are eventually taken by train to a city, presumably (but never guess outcome in a dream) to attend another school.  The film is admirably discussed on the DVD in two interviews with the director, who declines to ""explain"" what is happening here. Suffice it to say that this film does not respect chronology or explanation.  Like other of Wedekind's works, it exists, and was created, to be absorbed rather than ""understood,"" much as looking at a great painting is assisted by the viewer's openhearted acceptance of the effort.  Not for everyone, but an interesting look at Cotillard's choices in her early career -- how the girls' freedom is always tinged with the oppressiveness of their days.  Cotillard has a great line: ""Obedience is the only path to happiness.""  Perhaps Wedekind was remarking on the way children were raised in his day.  Perhaps the director is remembering her days growing up in an oppressive country in the l960s. It's all up to the viewer.",4,Interesting for Marion Cotillard fans....,1209945600,"05 5, 2008",2008,1738,"['German', 'expressionist', 'writer', 'Frank', 'Wedekind', 'symbolist', 'Mini-Haha', 'Corporal', 'Education', 'Young', 'Girls', '1888', 'basis', 'film', 'directed', 'Lucile', 'Hadzihalilovic', 'place', 'girls', 'school', 'affluent', 'students', 'who', 'arrive', 'coffin', 'one', 'one', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'leave', 'Anyone', 'who', 'leave', 'stay', 'there', 'forever', 'become', 'one', 'old', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'servants', 'current', 'girls', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'one', 'two', 'teachers', 'Eva', 'ballet', 'teacher', 'often', 'moved', 'tears', 'other', 'teacher', 'science', 'teacher', 'who', 'limp', 'girls', 'are', 'always', 'dressed', 'white', 'beginning', 'sound', 'dream', 'sequence', 'girls', 'wear', 'colored', 'ribbons', 'denote', 'seniority', 'older', 'girls', 'are', 'eventually', 'taken', 'train', 'city', 'presumably', 'never', 'guess', 'outcome', 'dream', 'attend', 'school', 'film', 'admirably', 'discussed', 'DVD', 'two', 'interviews', 'director', 'who', 'explain', 'what', 'happening', 'here', 'Suffice', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'respect', 'chronology', 'explanation', 'other', 'Wedekind', 'works', 'was', 'created', 'be', 'absorbed', 'rather', 'understood', 'much', 'looking', 'great', 'painting', 'assisted', 'viewer', 'openhearted', 'acceptance', 'effort', 'Not', 'everyone', 'interesting', 'look', 'Cotillard', 'choices', 'early', 'career', 'how', 'girls', 'freedom', 'always', 'tinged', 'oppressiveness', 'days', 'Cotillard', 'great', 'line', 'Obedience', 'only', 'path', 'happiness', 'Perhaps', 'Wedekind', 'was', 'remarking', 'way', 'children', 'were', 'raised', 'day', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'remembering', 'days', 'growing', 'up', 'oppressive', 'country', 'l960s', 'up', 'viewer']",Innocence Region 2

952207,AF17B68RFKUW4,B000BX6FW8,Mrs. Robinson,"[7, 7]","Maybe it's something about the French. This film, and ""Ponette"", rank with me as the loveliest, truest cinematic works dealing with childhood.(Well, I should add that men might not feel that way, since both films deal with little girls -- I am interested to know what male lovers of cinema would vote for.)Aesthetically, this is a first-rate film, from its highly stylized, deliberately old-fashioned opening to its purposefully abrupt end at the fountain. I watched this in complete absorption before watching the interviews with the charming Lucile Hadzihalilovic, and I am in complete agreement with her choices regarding filming and soundtrack. As she intended, mood is set by the interesting visuals, but there is no Hollywood-style musical score guiding the viewer's emotional response.Ms. Hadzihalilovic intended the story to be open to interpretation, but although one might quibble over details, I don't see how anyone could see this as anything other than a poetic, psychological interpretation of the voyage from young girlhood to sexual maturity. In this it is accurate, moving, and beautiful. As Hadzihalilovic intended, it is like a fairytale and a dream, something to which every viewer can bring her own experience.I am always impressed with directors who can work with young children. This director gets a naturalistic performance from her little girls, which is more than any recent American movie I can remember could boast of. As a girl who grew up in the '70s and '80s, I remember girls at single-sex schools dressed in uniform, jumping rope and playing with hula hoops, and the director gets more than that -- she gets the feel of being a little girl in that kind of environment. As she herself notes, in real life, the girls would have been crueler to each other. True, but no matter -- she gets the gentler side of it right.Some have described this movie as being somehow perverted. I disagree. It is our jaded modern view that would incline someone to see this. I think this beautiful film lives up to its name and shows innocence, a good and lovely thing, with darkness around the edges.

952208,AITI12BBKCYG9,B000BX6FW8,"N. Thomas ""LibraryFiend""","[10, 25]","""Innocence"" is a freak show.The setting is apparently some sort of school, although that is a term to be applied very loosely.  It's a semi-penitentiary; all girls, each neophyte arrives in an elaborate (and locked) wooden coffin.  There is a large starburst immediately over the (unconscious) child's face, covered in mesh wire, so the girl can respire.Each novice is then introduced to the routine of her new prison-like existence by the established girls.  Each ""year"" (reinforcing the school idea) wears an identifying color of hair ribbons.  The classes the young ladies take are divided into biology/nature studies and dance.  And dance.And more dance.It seemed to me this institution was a repressive ballet academy for young girls.  Tyros are admitted at age six, such as Iris, the newbie whose story makes the central thread of this film.  The departure age (I won't say ""graduating"" because there's hardly any kind of accuracy there) seems to be around fourteen.Several elderly ladies minister to the daily needs of the charges but their roles are very minimal.  The two instructors are Mlle. Eva (Marion Cotillard) and Mlle. Edith (Helene de Fougerolles), both younger women;Eva seems to struggle with the harshness of the daily regime while Edith apparently bears no such compunction.Iris asks repeatedly when she can return to her little brother.  The answer:  ""IT IS FORBIDDEN"".  This is the reply to most questions, such as ""When can I leave?""  ""Why can't we play in the woods?"" and ""Why can't I stop dancing""?Another young girl--Laura--who was admitted at the same time as Iris, determinedly makes her escape.  Despite the enormous, ivy-clad walls surrounding the ""campus"" of the dreary, run-down building, there is also a lake.  Mysterious, forboding gurgling noises (like water in a rushing stream) mark the film's opening scenes.  What the deeper symbolism of the creepy confluential cacophony is supposed to mean escapes me completely...Brave little Laura lights out in a small boat, witnessed by Iris, who declines to accompany her.  Laura makes it several hundred yards into the body of water when she (rather resignedly) notices the craft is leaking.In the next scene, Mlle. Eva somberly informs her pupils (she is the dance teacher) that Laura will never be seen again and that they will hold a ritual in her honor.And then they burn her--in another coffin, this one sans breathing-hole--on an immense funeral pyre.The viewer's foremost questions regarding this fable are 1) what kind of ""school"" is this?  2)  where do the girls come from and where are their families?  and  3)  who is the ""headmistress""?Once a year, Headmistress comes to visit and has a special recital put on for her benefit.  If she selects a girl, the student leaves the school with the Headmistress, never to be seen or heard from again.  One poor student, believing she has a chance of being selected (and hence taken away), meets with crushing disappointment.  Headmistress carefully examines each girl, even so far as asking to peer into her mouth (like someone choosing a thoroughbred!).At some point, each class is promoted to ""the theatre"", where they perform their dance routines for live audiences shrouded in shadows.Once each performing class meets some kind of criteria, they are shuttled out of the school via a bizarre underground subway and into Paris.There they are enrolled in a ""real world"" dance school for high-school age enrollees.""Innocence"" is a movie I have seen billed as SUSPENSE.  THRILLER.  MYSTERY.  Etc.  I cannot say I find these descriptives useful.

952209,AKI1CK229BDUC,B000BX6FW8,PsyRC,"[13, 19]","There have been a number of interpretations about this film.  I guess the important thing is to contribute...  Anyway, soon after it was over, I had the same feeling that overtook me during it's entirety, which was uncertainty.  It took almost one day for the meaning of it to permeate through my mind and help me discern what was being shown.  I truly dismiss any claims pertaining to lewd or inappropriate images... whatever abstract version of reality was being amplified, it drew me in perfectly.  It was a very powerful allegory of modern life.  Freedom is  a myth, that's common-place.  However, we continue to live one day after the next as if there weren't strings controlling our movements.  We play within our confines.  Such is this movie... there are walls, there is a hierarchy, discipline is enforced.  They arrive at a young age, albeit in a coffin (already deceased).  And they dance... Perfection is not demanded of them, the act is the goal.  As the oldest girls move across the stage every night, the shadows of the spectators loom in the background as demons foreseeing perverse omens...  Very poignant.  I guess people lose their innocence early on in life, more and more prematurely in an exponential fashion, especially in this western hyperactive, hypersexual environment we have created.  But I guess the damaged minds of the ones overseeing our children are the true monsters... no matter how secluded and whisked away the upbringing may take place, there is no escape from the wretched mold children are shaped with... they dance, and the genuine innocence in their actions is oblivious to what they are inexorably being groomed to become, even if it is only suggested in the subtext of the film.  As we view the chronology of their time in this alternative reality, all becomes clear.  However, seeing purity in its quintessential form, and then its slow death at the hands of those who are blind to its light, can become quite unbearable.  Anyway, I recommend this film (not that my recommendation means anything), if for no other reason than to show us a mirror of the running-towards-the-mousetrap philosophy reigning over our world, perpetuating our frustrations by psychotic projective identification, murdering off the beauty of future generations as if it would erase our own erroneous undertakings throughout our insipid existence.",5,Heart-breaking,1254787200,"10 6, 2009",2009,2367,"['have', 'been', 'number', 'interpretations', 'film', 'guess', 'important', 'thing', 'contribute', 'Anyway', 'soon', 'was', 'had', 'same', 'feeling', 'overtook', 'entirety', 'was', 'uncertainty', 'took', 'almost', 'one', 'day', 'meaning', 'permeate', 'mind', 'help', 'discern', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'shown', 'truly', 'dismiss', 'claims', 'pertaining', 'lewd', 'inappropriate', 'images', 'abstract', 'version', 'reality', 'was', 'being', 'amplified', 'drew', 'perfectly', 'was', 'very', 'powerful', 'allegory', 'modern', 'life', 'Freedom', 'myth', 'common-place', 'However', 'continue', 'live', 'one', 'day', 'next', 'were', ""n't"", 'strings', 'controlling', 'movements', 'play', 'confines', 'Such', 'movie', 'are', 'walls', 'hierarchy', 'discipline', 'enforced', 'arrive', 'young', 'age', 'albeit', 'coffin', 'already', 'deceased', 'dance', 'Perfection', 'not', 'demanded', 'act', 'goal', 'oldest', 'girls', 'move', 'stage', 'night', 'shadows', 'spectators', 'loom', 'background', 'demons', 'foreseeing', 'perverse', 'omens', 'Very', 'poignant', 'guess', 'people', 'lose', 'innocence', 'early', 'life', 'more', 'more', 'prematurely', 'exponential', 'fashion', 'especially', 'western', 'hyperactive', 'hypersexual', 'environment', 'have', 'created', 'guess', 'damaged', 'minds', 'ones', 'overseeing', 'children', 'are', 'true', 'monsters', 'matter', 'how', 'secluded', 'whisked', 'away', 'upbringing', 'may', 'take', 'place', 'escape', 'wretched', 'mold', 'children', 'are', 'shaped', 'dance', 'genuine', 'innocence', 'actions', 'oblivious', 'what', 'are', 'inexorably', 'being', 'groomed', 'become', 'even', 'only', 'suggested', 'subtext', 'film', 'view', 'chronology', 'time', 'alternative', 'reality', 'becomes', 'clear', 'However', 'seeing', 'purity', 'quintessential', 'form', 'then', 'slow', 'death', 'hands', 'who', 'are', 'blind', 'light', 'can', 'become', 'quite', 'unbearable', 'Anyway', 'recommend', 'film', 'not', 'recommendation', 'anything', 'other', 'reason', 'show', 'mirror', 'running-towards-the-mousetrap', 'philosophy', 'reigning', 'world', 'perpetuating', 'frustrations', 'psychotic', 'projective', 'identification', 'murdering', 'off', 'beauty', 'future', 'generations', 'would', 'erase', 'own', 'erroneous', 'undertakings', 'insipid', 'existence']",Innocence Region 2
