775022,A2KP0ONGECY1WT,B0000CABKY,"cs211 ""cs211""","[6, 13]","I saw this film with my daughter (6 years old) and her friend (7), none of whom are Rugrats fans, mostly because they consider the Rugrat's humor to be too immature and inappropriate. My daughter and I did, however, mostly enjoy last year's The Wild Thornberrys Movie.The plot is a literal and figurative shipwreck. The Rugrats and their parents end up on an uninhabited island somewhere in the Pacific, on which the Thornberrys happen to be. Various groups and individuals splinter off in search of others. By the time Nigel Thornberry gets knocked on the head and reverts to the mental age of a 3 year-old, I had lost track of who was looking for whom and why. How a kid is supposed to follow all these machinations is beyond me.The sheer number of characters and the randomness with which they run into each other prevent any sort of character depth from being explored. For example, in The Wild Thornberrys Movie, considerable attention was given to Darwin the monkey, who is one of the more interesting characters in this entire assembly (Darwin is smart and makes very insightful observations of human behavior, but he can only communicate with one person, Eliza - to everyone else, he is a dumb monkey). However, here he has what could be characterized as a cameo appearance at best. So, unless you are already familiar with all the characters, and don't expect much in terms of character development, you'll be disappointed.I think there was a moral to the story (something about leadership and redemption), but I was nodding off by the end of the movie, having lost track of the plot. The audience I saw the film with was mostly subdued, with only a few audible laughs. My daughter and her friend said they liked the movie, but they like every movie I take them to, as long as I buy them popcorn. They did not talk about the movie at all the rest of the weekend. On the way home, we listened to the Lilo & Stitch soundtrack, which has much better songs than the few musical numbers in this movie.I'm not giving this movie the worst rating, because it might be enjoyable for a few Rugrat fans. And the Rugrats' potty humor is not as bad as it could have been, although there are diaper jokes, bird droppings, and Spike the dog raises his leg a few times.",1,"Forgettable, confusing, with few laughs",1065571200,"10 8, 2003",2003,2262,"['saw', 'film', 'daughter', '6', 'years', 'old', 'friend', '7', 'none', 'whom', 'are', 'Rugrats', 'fans', 'mostly', 'consider', 'Rugrat', 'humor', 'be', 'too', 'immature', 'inappropriate', 'daughter', 'did', 'however', 'mostly', 'enjoy', 'last', 'year', 'Wild', 'Thornberrys', 'Movie.The', 'plot', 'literal', 'figurative', 'shipwreck', 'Rugrats', 'parents', 'end', 'up', 'uninhabited', 'island', 'somewhere', 'Pacific', 'Thornberrys', 'happen', 'be', 'Various', 'groups', 'individuals', 'splinter', 'off', 'search', 'others', 'time', 'Nigel', 'Thornberry', 'knocked', 'head', 'mental', 'age', '3', 'year-old', 'had', 'lost', 'track', 'who', 'was', 'looking', 'whom', 'why', 'How', 'kid', 'supposed', 'follow', 'machinations', 'me.The', 'sheer', 'number', 'characters', 'randomness', 'run', 'other', 'prevent', 'sort', 'character', 'depth', 'being', 'explored', 'example', 'Wild', 'Thornberrys', 'Movie', 'considerable', 'attention', 'was', 'given', 'Darwin', 'monkey', 'who', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'characters', 'entire', 'assembly', 'Darwin', 'smart', 'very', 'insightful', 'observations', 'human', 'behavior', 'can', 'only', 'communicate', 'one', 'person', 'Eliza', 'everyone', 'else', 'dumb', 'monkey', 'However', 'here', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'characterized', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'best', 'So', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'terms', 'character', 'development', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed.I', 'think', 'was', 'moral', 'story', 'something', 'leadership', 'redemption', 'was', 'nodding', 'off', 'end', 'movie', 'having', 'lost', 'track', 'plot', 'audience', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'mostly', 'subdued', 'only', 'few', 'audible', 'laughs', 'daughter', 'friend', 'said', 'liked', 'movie', 'like', 'movie', 'take', 'as', 'long', 'buy', 'popcorn', 'did', 'not', 'talk', 'movie', 'rest', 'weekend', 'way', 'home', 'listened', 'Lilo', 'Stitch', 'soundtrack', 'much', 'better', 'songs', 'few', 'musical', 'numbers', 'movie.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'movie', 'worst', 'rating', 'might', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'few', 'Rugrat', 'fans', 'Rugrats', 'potty', 'humor', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'diaper', 'jokes', 'bird', 'droppings', 'Spike', 'dog', 'leg', 'few', 'times']",N/A

775029,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B0000CABKY,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 3]","A slim plot conspires to shipwreck the cast of ""Rugrats"" on a tropical island being explored by the ""Wild Thornberrys"".  Tommy Pickles's father mistakenly thinks that a do-it-yourself cruise is just what everybody wants.  Instead, they all wind up on the shores of an island that is the only known habitat for a white leopard much sought after by Tommy Pickles's hero, Nigel Thornberry (he always manages to keep from getting eaten by ""crocagators"").  The characters meet and face all sorts of adventures which they overcome by working together.Though longer than a single episode of either show, this movie manages to have less interest than a single episode of each.  My kids loved it, though I remember thinking that last winter's Thornberry's movie was more imaginative, or atleast coherent.  The story is just overwhelmed by the number of different characters trying to steal the show, and doesn't do much with any of them.  (Eliza Thornberry gets barely any time, mostly around because her power to speak with animals is the only way they can explain why Spike suddenly sounds like Bruce Willis).  The animation won't win any awards - when the mystery leopard shows up, it breaks into song voiced by Chrissie Hynde, though it doesn't look or move anything like you'd expect a man-eating feline to if it sounded like it sang for ""The Pretenders"".  If you're looking for a flick your kids will like (and don't mind paying today's ticket prices to watch it), even though you'll probably sleep through most of it, this is your flick.  Nobody makes movies that are amusing for kids and adults anymore, and anybody who thinks otherwise would never consider this flick an example of that rare breed.  The flick has a few early scenes (in which the rugrats explore an imaginary ""train forest"" teeming with vicious animals, and a shipwreck scene obviously suggested by ""A Perfect Storm"") which might scare some kids, but the rest is pretty safe.",3,a extended NikToon,1057622400,"07 8, 2003",2003,1942,"['slim', 'plot', 'conspires', 'shipwreck', 'cast', 'Rugrats', 'tropical', 'island', 'being', 'explored', 'Wild', 'Thornberrys', 'Tommy', 'Pickles', 'father', 'mistakenly', 'do-it-yourself', 'cruise', 'just', 'what', 'everybody', 'Instead', 'wind', 'up', 'shores', 'island', 'only', 'known', 'habitat', 'white', 'leopard', 'much', 'sought', 'Tommy', 'Pickles', 'hero', 'Nigel', 'Thornberry', 'always', 'keep', 'getting', 'eaten', 'crocagators', 'characters', 'meet', 'face', 'sorts', 'adventures', 'overcome', 'working', 'together.Though', 'longer', 'single', 'episode', 'show', 'movie', 'have', 'less', 'interest', 'single', 'episode', 'kids', 'loved', 'remember', 'thinking', 'last', 'winter', 'Thornberry', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'imaginative', 'atleast', 'coherent', 'story', 'just', 'overwhelmed', 'number', 'different', 'characters', 'trying', 'steal', 'show', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'Eliza', 'Thornberry', 'barely', 'time', 'mostly', 'power', 'speak', 'animals', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'explain', 'why', 'Spike', 'suddenly', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'animation', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'when', 'mystery', 'leopard', 'up', 'song', 'voiced', 'Chrissie', 'Hynde', ""n't"", 'look', 'move', 'anything', ""'d"", 'expect', 'man-eating', 'feline', 'sounded', 'sang', 'Pretenders', ""'re"", 'looking', 'flick', 'kids', 'will', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'paying', 'today', 'ticket', 'prices', 'watch', 'even', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'sleep', 'most', 'flick', 'Nobody', 'movies', 'are', 'amusing', 'kids', 'adults', 'anymore', 'anybody', 'who', 'otherwise', 'would', 'never', 'consider', 'flick', 'example', 'rare', 'breed', 'flick', 'few', 'early', 'scenes', 'rugrats', 'explore', 'imaginary', 'train', 'forest', 'teeming', 'vicious', 'animals', 'shipwreck', 'scene', 'obviously', 'suggested', 'A', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'might', 'scare', 'kids', 'rest', 'pretty', 'safe']",N/A

Special numbered cards, each representing a particular smell, were available with kids' meals at participating Burger King restaurants from 6/2/2003 to 6/29/2003, and separately at Blockbuster Video stores from 6/15/2003 until supplies ran out.Participants picked up the cards, then took them to the local movie theater showing the film. When a particular number flashed on the screen, viewers scratched off the scent that had that particular number on it. Numbers flashing in red mean that the viewer should find the corresponding number on their card (glow-in-the-dark for their convenience), and be ready to scratch-and-sniff when the on-screen number turns green.Sadly, Paramount Home Video decided not to include the cards with the DVD release.

I've seen both Rugrats movies and because of my work at a day care center and some babysitting, have seen &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot; at least half a dozen times. Both shows are humorous and educational and have appeal not only for children, but to adults as well. I was really excited about the seeing RUGRATS GO WILD and how the filmmakers would bring the two different series together.  I think they did a fairly decent job.The Rugrats gang is supposed to take a cruise, but Stew arranges for something a little different: a cruise on their own little ship. On the voyage they run into a tropical storm and eventually find themselves shipwrecked on an unpopulated island. Unbeknownst to them, Nigel Thornberry and his family is on the other side of the island, trying to capture a very rare cat on film. Nigel Thornberry happens to be Tommy's hero and Tommy believes that he has to be somewhere in the jungle.  He convinces the other kids and the Rugrat babies leave their side in the island and enter the jungle hoping to run into Nigel Thornberry. Surprisingly they do. However, Nigel gets bumped on the head and reverts to a childlike state.  Angelica meets up with Debbie and Donnie switches clothes with Chucky and chaos insues.I really enjoyed watching RUGRATS GO WILD. I admit that parts of the movie might be frightening for younger children and the movie deals with some tougher issues that the two shows normally don't touch. Nevertheless, I thought the filmmakers did a wonderful job of bringing everyone together and uniting the two different worlds.  Younger children might be frightened by the storm or the wanderings of the babies in the jungle.  Some will be confused  by all the parallel story-lines.  However, older children and youth will probably enjoy the movie and all the different elements.  Adults will probably like it as well.
