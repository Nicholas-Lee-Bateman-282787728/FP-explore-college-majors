975091,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000ENYY0K,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[2, 3]","""The Loss of Nameless Things"" is a haunting documentary about the tragic life of playwright/director Oakley Hall. He was the enfant terrible son of a famous poet, and was almost burdened by his father's genius. He was a wild child, as his short about Dionysus and the Maeneads shows. He brought obscure outsider theater to the stage, from'Tis Pity She's a Whore and Other Plays: The Lover's Melancholy; The Broken Heart; 'Tis Pity She's a Whore; Perkin Warbeck (Oxford World's Classics), in which Shakespeare's contemporary, John Ford, even borrows fromRomeo and Julietin his Jacobean tragedy about incestuous sibling lovers, toThe Ubu Plays: Includes: Ubu Rex; Ubu Cuckolded; Ubu Enchained, which explored absurdity and exploitation. Oakley Hall's version ofFrankenstein (Qualitas Classics)terrified the audience. Before his tragic accident, Oakley was planning on his version ofDoctor Faustus (Signet Classics).Oakley Hall wrestled with his demons. His first marriage was haunted with bad omens at the wedding, domestic violence, and drug abuse. When he learned that his wife was pregnant, he became even more self-destructive. He struggled with his gifts. An immensely talented and charismatic actor/director/playwright, he managed to lead a theater company in the Catskills. His ""Grinder's Stand"" was a play about the mysterious death of Meriwether Lewis.Oakley's accident is surrounded with mystery. To this day, there are unanswered questions. Miraculously, he survived the ordeal. He does not remember who he is, yet he is remembered with reverence. ""The Loss of Nameless Things"" shows that Oakley Hall was like Hyperion and Icarus, the sons of Helios and Daedalus, who fell due to their pride. It was a tragic fall from grace- yet there is a sense of redemption and hope.",5,"""Whereof one cannot speak,one must remain silent""",1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,1779,"['Loss', 'Nameless', 'Things', 'haunting', 'documentary', 'tragic', 'life', 'playwright/director', 'Oakley', 'Hall', 'was', 'enfant', 'terrible', 'son', 'famous', 'poet', 'was', 'almost', 'burdened', 'father', 'genius', 'was', 'wild', 'child', 'short', 'Dionysus', 'Maeneads', 'shows', 'brought', 'obscure', 'outsider', 'theater', 'stage', ""from'Tis"", 'Pity', 'Whore', 'Other', 'Plays', 'Lover', 'Melancholy', 'Broken', 'Heart', 'Pity', 'Whore', 'Perkin', 'Warbeck', 'Oxford', 'World', 'Classics', 'Shakespeare', 'contemporary', 'John', 'Ford', 'even', 'fromRomeo', 'Julietin', 'Jacobean', 'tragedy', 'incestuous', 'sibling', 'lovers', 'Ubu', 'Plays', 'Includes', 'Ubu', 'Rex', 'Ubu', 'Cuckolded', 'Ubu', 'Enchained', 'explored', 'absurdity', 'exploitation', 'Oakley', 'Hall', 'version', 'ofFrankenstein', 'Qualitas', 'Classics', 'terrified', 'audience', 'tragic', 'accident', 'Oakley', 'was', 'planning', 'version', 'ofDoctor', 'Faustus', 'Signet', 'Classics', '.Oakley', 'Hall', 'wrestled', 'demons', 'first', 'marriage', 'was', 'haunted', 'bad', 'omens', 'wedding', 'domestic', 'violence', 'drug', 'abuse', 'When', 'learned', 'wife', 'was', 'pregnant', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'self-destructive', 'struggled', 'gifts', 'immensely', 'talented', 'charismatic', 'actor/director/playwright', 'managed', 'lead', 'theater', 'company', 'Catskills', 'Grinder', 'Stand', 'was', 'play', 'mysterious', 'death', 'Meriwether', 'Lewis.Oakley', 'accident', 'surrounded', 'mystery', 'day', 'are', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'Miraculously', 'survived', 'ordeal', 'not', 'remember', 'who', 'yet', 'remembered', 'reverence', 'Loss', 'Nameless', 'Things', 'Oakley', 'Hall', 'was', 'Hyperion', 'Icarus', 'sons', 'Helios', 'Daedalus', 'who', 'fell', 'due', 'pride', 'was', 'tragic', 'fall', 'grace-', 'yet', 'sense', 'redemption', 'hope']",The Loss of Nameless Things

Some have potentially interesting subject matter, but are ill wrought. Others are just paint by numbers formula documentaries with a political, religious, or philosophic agenda. Still others are just plain amateurish. Then there are documentaries like Bill Rose's 2005 The Loss Of Nameless Things, about the rise and violent fall of a playwright and dramaturg whose critical and artistic star seemed to be waxing, before, like many clich&eacute;d artists of talent, he kyboshed it all and nearly killed himself. Instead, he ended up destroying his brain, his marriage, his past, and his future. The artist in question was Oakley `Tad' Hall III, son of the fairly well known novelist and Academic, Oakley Hall II.Rose's film is odd because it is compelling, due to its structural innovation (its first 70% details Hall's rise, until his 1978 accident, without a single contemporaneous image of Hall, and the last 30% shows the brain damaged Hall dominating the film), even as the life it tells of is both trite and rather tritely conveyed by the man's peers and friends. Of course, like Arthur Rimbaud, Jim Morrison, Vincent Van Gogh, and countless other artists of merit who flamed out early, Hall is hagiographized as a potential great, even though the little bits of his art the film presents is, well, trite. Naturally, he had an obsession: for Hall it was the mediocre French playwright Alfred Jarry, and his rather over the top work, Ubu Roi. If that's not enough to give one a sense of the man's easy box, Hall is portrayed as a sexual magnet for the opposite sex and an artistic outsider and rebel, even though his father was a well known and influential leader of the MFA movement in California in the middle of last century. To say that Tad Hall was `connected' is an understatement. To top matters off, of course, this rebel, in the late 60s, was into partying, sex, drugs, free love, etc. Stories of his `brilliance' and `genius' and other good qualities are neverending, it seems.",3,Good,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,2083,"['many', 'documentaries', 'available', 'streaming', 'Netflix', 'very', 'few', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'have', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'subject', 'matter', 'are', 'ill', 'wrought', 'Others', 'are', 'just', 'paint', 'numbers', 'formula', 'documentaries', 'political', 'religious', 'philosophic', 'agenda', 'Still', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'amateurish', 'Then', 'are', 'documentaries', 'Bill', 'Rose', '2005', 'Loss', 'Nameless', 'Things', 'rise', 'violent', 'fall', 'playwright', 'dramaturg', 'critical', 'artistic', 'star', 'seemed', 'be', 'waxing', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'artists', 'talent', 'kyboshed', 'nearly', 'killed', 'Instead', 'ended', 'up', 'destroying', 'brain', 'marriage', 'past', 'future', 'artist', 'question', 'was', 'Oakley', 'Tad', 'Hall', 'III', 'son', 'fairly', 'well', 'known', 'novelist', 'Academic', 'Oakley', 'Hall', 'II.Rose', 'film', 'odd', 'compelling', 'due', 'structural', 'innovation', 'first', '70', '%', 'details', 'Hall', 'rise', '1978', 'accident', 'single', 'contemporaneous', 'image', 'Hall', 'last', '30', '%', 'brain', 'damaged', 'Hall', 'dominating', 'film', 'even', 'life', 'trite', 'rather', 'tritely', 'conveyed', 'man', 'peers', 'friends', 'course', 'Arthur', 'Rimbaud', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Vincent', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'countless', 'other', 'artists', 'merit', 'who', 'flamed', 'out', 'early', 'Hall', 'hagiographized', 'potential', 'great', 'even', 'little', 'bits', 'art', 'film', 'presents', 'well', 'trite', 'Naturally', 'had', 'obsession', 'Hall', 'was', 'mediocre', 'French', 'playwright', 'Alfred', 'Jarry', 'rather', 'top', 'work', 'Ubu', 'Roi', 'not', 'enough', 'give', 'one', 'sense', 'man', 'easy', 'box', 'Hall', 'portrayed', 'sexual', 'magnet', 'opposite', 'sex', 'artistic', 'outsider', 'rebel', 'even', 'father', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'influential', 'leader', 'MFA', 'movement', 'California', 'middle', 'last', 'century', 'say', 'Tad', 'Hall', 'was', 'connected', 'understatement', 'top', 'matters', 'course', 'rebel', 'late', '60s', 'was', 'partying', 'sex', 'drugs', 'free', 'love', 'etc', 'Stories', 'brilliance', 'genius', 'other', 'good', 'qualities', 'are', 'neverending']",The Loss of Nameless Things
975093,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B000ENYY0K,David R. Eastwood,"[0, 0]","THE LOSS OF NAMELESS THINGS (2006) is a documentary dealing with numerous aspects of a catastrophic head injury suffered by Oakley Hall III in 1978. It is a very uneven film with some excellent parts, but it has far too many interviews of aging 5th-rate actors/actresses who are not too bright, not well informed, and much of the time not believable.The editing is often poor, and the continuity is fuzzy at best. It seems that Bill Rose, the maker of the film, ended up with hours of footage that could be used to tell perhaps a dozen or more different stories, but he could not make up his mind which one to place in the foreground, which ones to make subordinate, and which others to eliminate ... so he jumped around and tried to do them all.Among other stories, we get (1) the personal tragedy of Oakley Hall III; (2) the personal tragedy of his family (his wife, child, parents, and siblings); (3) the tragedy of society's supposed loss of a huge literary genius, cut down just as he was about to bloom into greatness; (4) the inspiring story of Oakley Hall III surviving a terrible brain injury and gradually recovering many of his mental functions; (5) the cautionary tale of an irresponsible community of youngish, twenty-something theater folks who abused their minds and bodies with excessive alcohol and various drugs before and after Oakley Hall was injured; (6) the cautionary tale of an irresponsible array of aging, fifty-something theater folks who misremember much of what occurred (or they never knew) and who in pretentious, self-aggrandizing ways ""invent"" stories about their past with Oakley Hall III; and (7) a polemical tale about how our society and most individuals are unwilling and/or unable to deal with and/or care for people whose brains are damaged.Besides several of my life experiences as a Hospice Care volunteer, I am reminded of some other fact-based films that have dealt with people who have suffered the loss of some mental functions, usually due to schizophrenia, and how lucky or unlucky they were in receiving treatment and humane care from others. THE STORY OF ADELE H (1975) showed, among other things, that even a great genius like Victor Hugo was unable to do much when his adult child lost her mind. SHINE (1996) showed a talented musician suffering a disastrous nervous breakdown and, with luck and tenacity, achieving a comeback of sorts. A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2001) showed an undoubted genius, who with luck and ""proper care"" was able to regain parts of his mental function. THE SOLOIST (2008) showed another talented musician, again with luck, after many years of hardship, regaining some of what he'd lost. And A GUY CALLED DAD (2011) showed how a caring daughter was coping with her father's schizophrenia.Significantly, in 2008 Bill Rose released a similar but far superior documentary about the life and death of Elizabeth Wiltsee, a brilliant woman with a 200 I.Q. and a huge talent for languages, who suffered a mental breakdown. Titled THIS DUST OF WORDS, it clearly shows how she became homeless because of her disability and how, decades later, she was mercifully ""adopted"" and cared for by a group Catholic women in a small California town for a short time before her death.To return to THE LOSS OF NAMELESS THINGS, like Victor Hugo, Hall's parents were unable to provide any intelligent care for their child after his fall from the bridge ... ditto his sisters. Some of the film's footage had interviews with them, probably done almost 20 years after his accident. And most of the other folks, chiefly actors Hall had worked with, were similarly useless as any sorts of caregivers or helpers in the years following his injury.After his wife divorced him, however, Oakley Hall III was very lucky with the pair of women who served (not simultaneously but serially) as his caregivers while his brain mended somewhat. It truly WAS remarkable that Oakley Hall regained as much mental function as he did: in the footage presented, Hall is able to speak cogently and move in a ""normal looking"" way and has an excellent, educated vocabulary.In my judgment, if I were giving this film a letter grade, it would be a ""C+"". Undoubtedly, a really good film could have been made about Oakley Hall, his injury, and its aftermath. It is too bad an editor with more experience or a more balanced view wasn't brought in to sort out the various threads of this documentary and discard the material that distracts viewers and detracts from its overall effect.POSTSCRIPT: Throughout this documentary there is lots of f-word usage in the interviews, especially by two or three of the women, and there also are some clips from home movies with total nudity, male and female. It seems fair to mention these things in case your parents or your children would be bothered in any way by these factors while watching the film with you.",3,"PARTS OF THIS FILM ARE EXCELLENT, BUT
