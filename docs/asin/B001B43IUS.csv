On the surface, it is similar: set in the 1960s, with a younger, more foolish detective assisting him.How is it different?Brilliantly written, but not dwelling on witty one-liners, the characters are believable. Neither is perfect, but clearly, Inspector George Gently holds a higher moral and ethical standard than Detective Sergeant John Bacchus.The cases themselves are ordinary enough -- usually murder with some interesting nuances. As it is set in the 1960s, the writers draw from the era for issues, police procedures and cultural milieu. While they aren't in the thick of protests and court cases, they are impacted from a distance just as anyone was then.As is typical of British TV that makes it to the States, production values are high. Each episode is much like a movie, not rushing through plot points. The relationship between Gently and Bacchus develops show by show, never beyond the reality of each character.

That show was also delightfully a very different slant on crime as we got to see it from behind the bench.  Most crime shows are seen from the viewpoints of cops, or, increasingly, forensic specialists.  This series puts us back into the more traditional cop format as Shaw plays George Gently, a London cop who relocates to Northumberland in Britain to solve crimes there upon the murder of his wife.  One different twist to the show is that it is set in the 1960s with all of those changes from present day society readily apparent.  As an American viewer, I didn't find the differences quite as striking as when that time differential is presented with an American setting, such as ""Mad Men.""  You may have to be a UKer to appreciate all the changes between the UK in the 1960s and present day.The show is very well done.  Martin Shaw and his sidekick, a guy young enough to be his son, are very good together.  Shaw is also one of those English actors with a voice one could listen to forever.  It is just a gorgeous masculine voice which magnifies everything else about him.My only criticism of the show is that it is yet another crime show and I am getting tired of so many crime shows.  That is why I enjoyed him as a judge so much more.Sidenote: Female viewers who fell in love with Richard Armitage as the lead in the UK's ""The North"", will find him in the pilot of this show as one of the potential bad guys.",4,Martin Shaw Does His Usual First Rate Job,1280188800,"07 27, 2010",2010,1459,"['loved', 'Martin', 'Shaw', 'Judge', 'John', 'Deed', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'delightfully', 'very', 'different', 'slant', 'crime', 'got', 'see', 'bench', 'Most', 'crime', 'shows', 'are', 'seen', 'viewpoints', 'cops', 'increasingly', 'forensic', 'specialists', 'series', 'back', 'more', 'traditional', 'cop', 'format', 'Shaw', 'George', 'Gently', 'London', 'cop', 'who', 'Northumberland', 'Britain', 'solve', 'crimes', 'there', 'murder', 'wife', 'One', 'different', 'twist', 'show', 'set', '1960s', 'changes', 'present', 'day', 'society', 'readily', 'apparent', 'American', 'viewer', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'differences', 'quite', 'as', 'striking', 'when', 'time', 'differential', 'presented', 'American', 'setting', 'such', 'Mad', 'Men', 'may', 'have', 'be', 'UKer', 'appreciate', 'changes', 'UK', '1960s', 'present', 'day.The', 'show', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Martin', 'Shaw', 'sidekick', 'guy', 'young', 'enough', 'be', 'son', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'together', 'Shaw', 'also', 'one', 'English', 'actors', 'voice', 'one', 'could', 'listen', 'forever', 'just', 'gorgeous', 'masculine', 'voice', 'everything', 'else', 'him.My', 'only', 'criticism', 'show', 'yet', 'crime', 'show', 'am', 'getting', 'tired', 'so', 'many', 'crime', 'shows', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'judge', 'so', 'much', 'more.Sidenote', 'Female', 'viewers', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'lead', 'UK', 'North', 'will', 'find', 'pilot', 'show', 'one', 'potential', 'bad', 'guys']",George Gently: Series One
1170423,A2W8VB44L96YE3,B001B43IUS,Criosa,"[1, 1]",Season Three is now showing on BBC - two of the new episodes have aired with the Series moving from 1964 to 1966. From everything I have read this season is as good if not better than the last two with some surprising twists which is only to be expected.  The whole series is excellent and well worth the purchase price.  Having lived in England throughout the 60s I can tell you the series captures the timeframe perfectly - a large number of people questioning the status quo and pushing and challenging the limits in oh so many ways with one man holding the line and trying to do the right thing day in and day out.  The old ways of life changing for the new ways - a society moving away from Aristocracy to Socialism in just about every facet of life.  By the end of the 60s the change from a true Aristocracy to a quasi Socialist country is almost complete thus finishing the social revolution that began around the end of WWI. This is a unique snapshot of how those changes impacted both metropolitan and rural police departments in Great Britain. George Gently fought the good fight and lost in London which would be played out in the press of the eighties with the Guilford 4 and the Birmigham 6 - a direct reflection of the corruption that is discussed in Season 1 and its final outcome where the Government had to come in and clean house in many major metro police departments including the Met.  Lets hope Gently does not lose the fight in Durham County and young Sargeant Bacchus realizes what the good fight should be before he loses his way completely.

1170424,A3HD7SVBY4JZOW,B001B43IUS,Donegal Dan,"[3, 4]","I discovered this series by accident when I was trying to learn more about Martin Shaw, who plays Adam Dalgliesh in two new P.D. James mysteries, and now plays the lead character in the George Gently series.  I did not like Shaw as much as Roy Marsden, the actor who has played Dalgliesh in a long series of the P.D. James stories but I liked him enough to be curious about him.  This led to my purchase of the first George Gently series, which I like very much and in which I think Shaw is very effective.  It is reminiscent of other detective pairings, such as Morse and Lewis and the ever-shifting pair in Midsomer Murders, but I think it is better than they are in some ways.  George Gently is a particularly interesting character, mixing toughness with integrity, old-school smarts, a bit of humor and a lot of humanity, however well camoflaged. His second in command, Bacchaus, is equally interesting and a stronger character than the usual sergeant or lieutenant.  His blend of cockiness, intelligence and  inclination to cut moral and ethical corners is a constant trial to his superior officer and a constant source of fascination to the viewer watching their interaction.  Both actors are outstanding in their parts, as is the rest of the supporting cast, and the stories are very well written and engrossing.  So far they are set in the 1960's, an era of change in England as elsewhere, and this lends special interest to the mysteries.  Overall, this is a great new detective series and I hope they will continue it and dramatize all the novels on which it is based.

As played by Martin Shaw, his lack of idiosyncrasy is as memorable as is the barely controlled drinking and irascibility of Morse or the Wodehousian demeanor of Wimsey. The plots are appropriate to the time in which the show is set, the 1960's, and are, generally, still interesting today. Lee Ingleby, as Gently's chief assistant, does a fine job capturing ambition, gaucherie, shrewdness, respect, and apprenticeship, so as to make the 'side-kick' role a major component of each episode. The usual array of fine character actors people the cast and the goodly measure of the regional subcultures of the UK which they convey, spice the proceedings.

There were some shooting scenes, and the shows dealt a lot with corruption in the police force itself but I guess that was to be expected for that period of time (the 1960's).  The plot summary basically explains it. The two main characters also made it pretty good. Here, I felt that Gently's partner was a lot like Barnaby's sidekicks -- brash and like to have control and Gently, even though he was still a bit rough, he still brought out his gentler side to make it work.

1170429,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B001B43IUS,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[0, 0]","George Gently Series (1 & 2) episodes are based on selections of the 46 Gently novels by Alan Hunter. This first series shows the beginning, when Commander Gently's wife is killed right before his eyes. Even through his grief, the cop takes the high road in finding criminals and bringing them to justice. Very much like ""Midsomer Murders"" [recommended] without the multiple murdered victims, but with the multi-plots in police, private, and associates lives. Good writing, it makes the show.Gently, played by Martin Shaw, is through, calm, and plays the mentor/father to his youthful assistant, Detective Sargent John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby). Their relationship is as important to the story/series as the crimes and investigations. Both are performance perfect. Bacchus bring some jollification to the show. Gently's grief, sometimes brings on tears. A highly emotional crime series. Setting is always 1964, Northumberland, England.SUBTITLES ARE PROVIDED IN BOTH SERIES ONE AND TWO. I can vouch for them, I use them. Each episode is a feature-length mystery, suspenseful, fast moving, and packed with plot. Sad that the episodes available total only 7 when there were 46 DCI Gently books. Is there hope for more? Wise British TV did bring back ""Foyle's War"" [6-stars] for additional post-war episodes. Please, BBC, more Gently!Episode details:GENTLY GO MAN--based on novel with the same name, after Gently's wife is murdered, he asks for assignment to a crime in Northumberland because the man who killed his wife attended the victim's funeral. Gently wants a shot at him. Gently meets Sgt Bacchus working on the cycle death and they get teamed to find the killer. The relationship between Gently & Bacchus is as much a story plot as finding the killer. With Mrs. Gentley's killer in the neighborhood, the overlap of plots keeps the story moving fast. In the Gently Series tradition, also a bit gruesome--like facial parts removed by a blow-torch. Will the young Bacchus police-style work teamed with the Gently investigation methods? Time will tell.THE BURNING MAN--based on novel 'Gently Where the Roads Go', a dead body, shot in the head, then burned beyond recognition, leaves one clue. A ring inside the stomach bearing an inscription--Wanda. The investigation leads to a local Irish pub, military guns, the IRA, and an agent of the Special Branch (cop). Bacchus gets caught in the middle--but middle of what? Bacchus and Gently work well together BUT Bacchus has lots to learn.BOMBER'S MOON--based on book with same name, a fisherman hooks a human eyeball. Then the body is found in the water but with a pre-death broken back. He's ID-ed as a rich German. Plenty of suspects including his son, a farmer, and a pub heavy-weight. Meanwhile Gently is concerned about Sgt Bacchus' financial instability. Cops in financial trouble are susceptible to bribes. The murder investigation begins to unveil a trail of stories and events of the 1940s past war-time emotions of the area. Gentley gets to be a bit physical with suspects with his bully mean right.

George Gently, whose wife has just been murdered in what appears to be a British gangland revenge hit, removes from London to rural Northumberland. He encounters the cocky, intuitively brilliant and slightly tarnished DS John Bacchus, who may have scored his rank by marrying the chief inspector's daughter.These are truly hard boiled detective stories, and they get a little bit detailed, so you do have to pay attention. Then again, the cast of characters are rich, complex, perfectly acted, and truly memorable, in the model of hardboiled fiction.  It's a joy to see Gently's perfect ethics kick into play as he faces the temptations of bribes and seduction. I like good guys, and George Gently is a slightly more granite and chiseled version of Foyle from FOYLE'S WAR.Bacchus, on the other hand, needs a strong hand to rein him in. Then again, grasping, materialistic, and enticed by the easy stepping stones of corruption, John Bacchus also amazes and pleases the reader (and Gently) with the occasional act of brilliance, and every now and then a truly heroic and completely confident act of police finesse.  It's this interplay of Gently mentoring Bacchus and yet Bacchus coming back with truly valuable contributions to their efforts that truly engage you and make you feel like these are stories worth watching.Every detail of the 60's is lovingly crafted into the stories.

""The Burning Man"" is an adaptation of his novel ""Gently Where the Roads Go"" (published in 1962). He wrote 47 books in the Gently series from 1955 to 1999.It's Northumberland, England, in the mid 1960's. A man is murdered, and the body is burned, leaving nothing but the skeletal remains. An inscribed ring found in the remains leads Gently to Wanda, the sexpot owner of a caf&eacute;. It's the beginning of a series of identity mix-ups that involves gun-running for the Irish Republican Army. An RAF service member is involved in weapons disappearing. People disappear, and we are kept guessing about the identity of the burned remains.Gently (effectively portrayed by actor Martin Shaw) works with his opportunistic and argumentative Sergeant Bacchus, and the two are constantly sparring. A special branch commander, Empton, is also battling with Gently. The secret branch officer cuts corners and beats a confession out of a suspect much to the dismay of the principled Gently who doesn't like interfering London cloak and dagger blokes on his patch. Sergeant Bacchus is offered a future job with the special branch by Empton if he reveals information to him, and the ambitious sergeant says more than he should.The country settings are evocative and add authenticity to the story. Through flashbacks we see some of the key characters. It's a complicated story with lots of red herrings, smoke and mirrors.You'll be entertained by this hour and a half mystery with enough puzzles to keep you intrigued.",5,Gently Playing It Sternly,1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,1660,"['Alan', 'Hunter', '1922-2005', 'one', 'favorite', 'British', 'mystery', 'writers', 'look', 'forward', 'television', 'renderings', 'Inspector', 'George', 'Gently', 'series', 'Burning', 'Man', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Gently', 'Where', 'Roads', 'Go', 'published', '1962', 'wrote', '47', 'books', 'Gently', 'series', '1955', '1999.It', 'Northumberland', 'England', 'mid', '1960', 'man', 'murdered', 'body', 'burned', 'leaving', 'nothing', 'skeletal', 'remains', 'inscribed', 'ring', 'found', 'remains', 'Gently', 'Wanda', 'sexpot', 'owner', 'caf', 'eacute', 'beginning', 'series', 'identity', 'mix-ups', 'gun-running', 'Irish', 'Republican', 'Army', 'RAF', 'service', 'member', 'involved', 'weapons', 'disappearing', 'People', 'disappear', 'are', 'kept', 'guessing', 'identity', 'burned', 'remains.Gently', 'effectively', 'portrayed', 'actor', 'Martin', 'Shaw', 'opportunistic', 'argumentative', 'Sergeant', 'Bacchus', 'two', 'are', 'constantly', 'sparring', 'special', 'branch', 'commander', 'Empton', 'also', 'battling', 'Gently', 'secret', 'branch', 'officer', 'corners', 'confession', 'suspect', 'much', 'dismay', 'principled', 'Gently', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'interfering', 'London', 'cloak', 'dagger', 'blokes', 'patch', 'Sergeant', 'Bacchus', 'offered', 'future', 'job', 'special', 'branch', 'Empton', 'information', 'ambitious', 'sergeant', 'more', 'country', 'settings', 'are', 'evocative', 'add', 'authenticity', 'story', 'flashbacks', 'see', 'key', 'characters', 'complicated', 'story', 'lots', 'red', 'herrings', 'smoke', 'mirrors.You', ""'ll"", 'be', 'entertained', 'hour', 'half', 'mystery', 'enough', 'puzzles', 'keep', 'intrigued']",George Gently: Series One

The George Gently series contains some of the humor, the quirkiness, and the fine acting of many of these.  It is somewhat darker than some of the British police procedurals, but with more lasting interest and richer character development than some.  My wife and I still rank Midsomer Murders as the best (in that it's best matched to our tastes), but the portrayal of Gently in the episodes in series 1 has a depth that seems to go a bit beyond Cracker and The Last Detective (the Dangerous Davies series).  Compared with Gently, the Mrs. Bradley program, too, seem funny, entertaining, but thin.  The feeling of depth in this program is difficult to define, but it does make series 1 of George Gently a standout.  Still, there will always be a soft spot in our hearts for Dangerous and (especially) for Inspector Barnaby and his various assistants in Midsomer Murders that Gently just can't break through.  However, I'll take this over Murder in Suburbia and Waking the Dead. In all fairness, I should mention that we check the Gently, Murder in Suburbia, Last Detective, and Waking the Dead out of our local public library -- the only two that we've purchased are the complete run (to date) of Midsomer Murder and the complete and way-too-short run of Robbie Coltrane's Cracker.

Now a DCI, we find him in the somewhat gritty port city of Durham, Northumberland. How he recieved the demotion and the change in venue is not clearly established, but the viewer understands why immediately. The DCI rank allows Gently to take a much more active part in any investigation, and perhaps more importantly, the man he suspects of his wife's murder is known to have a base of operations in Northumberland. Gently's partner DS Bacchus is much younger and light-years less experienced than Gently, and his youthful vigor admittedly clashes with Gently's more patient investigatory style. This creates a complex yet still enjoyable relationship between the two men.The entire series is based in the mid 1960's, and to great effect. All involved have accomplished much in bringing the viewer to a very specific time and place. Although filmed in Ireland, the cars, hairstyles, fashions, and emerging 1960's attitudes bring us directly to Northumberland, England ca. 1964.The entire series is beautifully realized. Every story is interesting and rings true regarding police procedure and being true to the period. Both lead actors are most impressive, particularly Martin Shaw as DCI Gently, who brings a quiet yet smoldering intensity to his role. Picture and sound quality are spot-on.

1170457,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B001B43IUS,Stephanie De Pue,"[7, 7]","""George Gently: Series 1"" is a television series of British mysteries/police procedurals that debuted in the United Kingdom on BBC1 in April 2007, and debuted on DVD, in the United States, in November 2008.  The series is set in Northeast Britain, Geordie country, in the 1960's.  It stars respected, award-winning actor Martin Shaw (Judge John Deed: Season One & Pilot Episode) as Commander George Gently, and is based on the long-running series of detective novels by Alan Hunter.  It has been compared toFoyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day; andMidsomer Murders: Set 16, for its combination of clever writing, stylish direction, and strong casts.  It comes in a boxed set that includes the series' first three feature-length episodes, running approximately 88 minutes each, for a total of 265 min.; a text interview with, and biography of its star, Martin Shaw; and, thank goodness, subtitles, as Geordie-speak falls hard upon American ears.Gently is an inconveniently incorruptible top cop, disliked almost as much by his colleagues as by criminal elements, and, therefore, bounces from Scotland Yard to Northumbria.  There he finds an unexpected ally in ambitious young Sergeant John Bacchus, an overeager, opinionated young man who tends to play fast and loose with police procedures, a part played by Lee Ingleby (Nicholas Nickleby).  Guest stars in Series 1 include Richard Armitage (Robin Hood: Season One); Phil Davis (Vera Drake); and John Kavanaugh (The Tudors - The Complete First Season).The well-written, absorbing mysteries unfold against a beautiful backdrop we're meant to think is rural Britain, though as the series was partly financed by the Irish Film Board, I wonder if we aren't looking at beautiful rural Ireland.  Characters discuss the famous Hadrian's Wall that runs across Northumbria, and was built by the Romans during their pre-Christian era occupation of Britain, to keep those wild and wooly Scots out, but we never actually see it.  No matter, the entertainment has lovely backdrops, and is nicely filmed.  The BBC has clearly thrown money at the screen - there are excellent supporting casts, extras aplenty, and the characters' clothing and cars are appropriate to the era, when Britain was just beginning to think about shaking off its post-war deprivation and depression, and London was -possibly--just beginning to dream about swinging a bit.  None of this had reached the Northeast yet, of course - and, I can't help but wonder, did it ever? Never mind.The mysteries are:""Gently Go Man."" Gently's wife is killed in a hit-and-run accident; he reacts with bitterness, plans to take his pension, and retire somewhere to fish.  Until he discovers that Joe Webster, (played particularly strongly by Phil Davis), the sadistic criminal whom Gently believes is behind his wife's murder, has been seen in Northumbria.  Gently follows Webster there, and finds himself facing murders in a local motorcycle gang; also that his incorruptible reputation has preceded him, and is making the local cop shop quite uncomfortable.""The Burning Man.""  A body is found in a local wooded area, shot once through the head, then burned beyond recognition.  Only clue: gold ring engraved ""Wanda,"" found in the victim's stomach.  An emotionally satisfying, complex plot, dealing with IRA gunrunners and a disreputable man named Empton from the Criminal Investigation Department's Special Branch who's suddenly on the scene. Features some strong local women, too, dissatisfied with their pre-ordained roles in life.""Bomber's Moon.""  Gunter Schmeikel, a German bomber pilot who was shot down during the war, and billeted locally with a friendly pig-farming family, returns to visit. He's a fun-living, very successful businessman now, but he's got a dark side.  And his body is fished out of the harbor.  The detectives find anti-German feeling still strong locally and Schmeikel's cold and arrogant son hard to handle.  If you've read down this far in the reviews, you've likely seen that a number of reviewers have taken strong exception to a very brief scene, of an eyeball, in this episode.  Frankly, I didn't find it ""euuw""-making: the scene, like the rest of the series, is not, to me, bloody, gory, or unduly violent.These are complex plots, driven by vivid characters - and strong women--and I found them quite gripping.  Shaw plays the title character as a man of gravitas, and an insightful detective.  The 60's setting was a little problematic to me, as the quality of the film work was so obviously top-notch modern that, until and unless I was caught short by a brief scene of people smoking where they ought not to today, or heard a price given in the old money, pounds, shillings and pence, I really kept forgetting the series' historic setting.
