The actings are all great, I like it very much that David is trying different things. the directing....yeah sure I couldn't really judge since I don't see anything spetacular. The problem I have is simply the storyline. It is just S-I-L-L-Y, senseless and at times the sillyness just gets so tiresome. This is the kind of movie in which if you just want a good laugh (that is, if you think this kind of meaningless comedy is funny) it's the right movie for ya. But even though I did laugh, by the end of the movie I just felt this complete tiresome feeling from all the nonsense. It is just...fandangle.so yeah, watch it if you are this kind of comedy person and/or you are a DB die-hard fan. if not, avoid it.",3,"funny, but also really ridiculous",1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,844,"['sorry', ""'m"", 'not', 'comedy', 'person', 'least', 'not', 'kind', 'silly', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'big', 'DB', 'fan', 'why', 'saw', 'first', 'place', 'actings', 'are', 'great', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'David', 'trying', 'different', 'things', 'directing', '.yeah', 'sure', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'judge', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'spetacular', 'problem', 'have', 'simply', 'storyline', 'just', 'S-I-L-L-Y', 'senseless', 'times', 'sillyness', 'just', 'so', 'tiresome', 'kind', 'movie', 'just', 'want', 'good', 'laugh', 'think', 'kind', 'meaningless', 'comedy', 'funny', 'right', 'movie', 'ya', 'even', 'did', 'laugh', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'felt', 'complete', 'tiresome', 'feeling', 'nonsense', 'just', 'fandangle.so', 'yeah', 'watch', 'are', 'kind', 'comedy', 'person', 'are', 'DB', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'not', 'avoid']",These Girls

This is hip and smart and not at all the shallow mess it would have been if Hollywood had been involved.

Amanda Walsh(Canadians would know her as a VJ from Much Music) plays Glory Lorraine, who is the first to fall for Keith's ""charms"" & starts sleeping with him behind his wife's back. but then it gets worse, not only does she think she's in love with him but her friend, Keira(Caroline Dhavernas) sleeps with him as well. & then her other friend Lisa(Holly Lewis) decides she wants to sleep with him too to get herself pregnant. & then they all start telling each other that their sleeping with Keith without knowing their friends are also doing him. & after a long fight they slowly decide to start sharing and blackmail him to make sure he doesn't back out. I have to say, David is definitely willing to try new things here! his character is very twisted and dark, he has alot of shame in sleeping with these girls while he's married but does nothing about it. well, in the end he tries to find a way out of it but it only backfires as he gets what's coming to him. this film is silly, at times way too cheesy for its own good. lots of things don't make sense, there's no real lesson in the entire thing and I'm not sure why Keira has a change of heart at the end of the movie. it just seemed so random & stupid. this movie is sinful, funny, cheesy & I think overall, it's worth a viewing!",4,bad decisions can get worse sometimes,1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,1435,"['David', 'Boreanaz', 'Keith', 'Clark', 'sort', 'biker', 'gang', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'sure', 'what', 'real', 'job', 'not', 'overly', 'important', 'Amanda', 'Walsh', 'Canadians', 'would', 'know', 'VJ', 'Much', 'Music', 'Glory', 'Lorraine', 'who', 'first', 'fall', 'Keith', 'charms', 'sleeping', 'wife', 'back', 'then', 'worse', 'not', 'only', 'think', 'love', 'friend', 'Keira', 'Caroline', 'Dhavernas', 'as', 'well', 'then', 'other', 'friend', 'Lisa', 'Holly', 'Lewis', 'sleep', 'too', 'get', 'pregnant', 'then', 'start', 'telling', 'other', 'sleeping', 'Keith', 'knowing', 'friends', 'are', 'also', 'doing', 'long', 'fight', 'slowly', 'decide', 'start', 'sharing', 'blackmail', 'make', 'sure', ""n't"", 'back', 'out', 'have', 'say', 'David', 'definitely', 'willing', 'try', 'new', 'things', 'here', 'character', 'very', 'twisted', 'dark', 'alot', 'shame', 'sleeping', 'girls', 'married', 'nothing', 'well', 'end', 'find', 'way', 'only', 'what', 'coming', 'film', 'silly', 'times', 'way', 'too', 'cheesy', 'own', 'good', 'lots', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'real', 'lesson', 'entire', 'thing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Keira', 'change', 'heart', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'seemed', 'so', 'random', 'stupid', 'movie', 'sinful', 'funny', 'cheesy', 'think', 'overall', 'viewing']",These Girls

974213,A12KBUJ812LHZS,B000EMG922,Dave's Film Review,"[35, 38]","I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival and all the buzz was David Boreanaz is shirtless and naked through most of the movie. Well, I was more than surprised by the direction, plot, acting, and pacing of this excellent coming of age comedy. The acting bodes well all around. Caroline Dhavernas is terrific as the sly, spunky friend and fans of ""Wonderfalls"" will love this character. Amanda Walsh is really shining on ""Sons & Daughters"" and gives an excellent performance as the romantic, heart-broken friend. But most of all, these two characters are rounded out by the funniest on screen representation of repressed sexualtiy gone haywire. Holly Lewis gets the 'Most Akward' and 'Most Humorous' sex scene award. I mean this beats that  scene in Forrest Gump in Genny's dorm room. Lewis is absolutely genius in this role.  Boreanaz as always is a plus and not because he's naked (although many will disagree), but because he delivers a strong performance that will be a happy surprise to his Angel fans and a delight to everyone in general. I would definitely buy this movie. Hazlett is an excellent director with a brilliant sense of style and sound (this movie has a great soundtrack) and brings out some great performancesfrom all his actors. It is worth it just to watch the very original opening title sequence - a designer's delight.

I just love the big lug, and it's been really fun to watch him improve as an actor over the years. Second confession: my favorite part of the movie was David naked, and David playing a big pothead.That's... about all this movie has going for it. None of the leads are in any way sympathetic. In fact, I thought all four of them (including David's character Keith) were HIDEOUS human beings... and not in a fun way. The plot the three girls hatch is simply unbelievable, and Keith Too Stupid To Live for letting it happen to him. Not to mention he's completely gross for being ""that guy"" that hangs around banging high school girls well into his 30's.So... see it for David, if you're a fan.
