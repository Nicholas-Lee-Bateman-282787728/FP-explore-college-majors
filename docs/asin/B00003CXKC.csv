It lathers on the offensive in a way that gets a laugh but doesn't get to the root of the audience.  It fades quickly.  This is particularly true because of the fact that the gags are the only entertaining aspect of the film.  The core of the film, the plot itself, is a mess.  The main character, Sherman Klump, is a bore.  His whole plight (literally battling his inner demon) isn't the least bit interesting.  Add to that the fact that the token `girlfriend' role was given to a lackluster Janet Jackson (what happened to you girl?).  The film itself just doesn't work.

Well, it rarely happens that a sequel is better than the original, with THE KLUMPS it has. THE KLUMPS is a hilarious film, that will leave you laughing for a while after you see it. It picks up where the original left off, to expand on Sherman Klump's family. This time around, the plot is better, as is the quality of the film. Thus, I think it was better than the original.THE KLUMPS was not as groundbreaking as the first installment. However, it shows just how talented Eddie Murphy really is. Talented enough is he to play all the members of the Klump family (save the little boy) and a white exercise guru. Each character is wonderfully played and is unique. Also, as Sherman's love interest, we see the amazingly talented Janet Jackson. She is incredibly beautiful and adds real sparkle to the film. Her chemistry with Sherman is extremely believable, making the romance part of the film great.In essence, THE KLUMPS is a great film with a great plot and cast. If you love very very funny comedies, with great plots and a sparkle of romance, then THE KLUMPS is a film you should have. You won't be disappointed.

Not only is Nutty Prof 2 very funny, but very touching with themes about family and marriage.  Eddie Murphy is amazing - he plays men and women of all ages so convincingly that you can't spot ""the man in the suit"".  Thru the Klumps, Murphy provides us with some deeply emotional scenes in which he is just playing off of himself, acting to a blank space and people who really doesn't exist.  His timing and weight is perfect for each character.  All the Klumps are unique individuals, with their own dreams and fears.  I noticed also that many women who had seen this movie felt that Murphy's acting as women was very accurate.

After grossing more than $125 million at the box office, I would have to conclude that moviegoers couldn't get enough.  This sequel is a one-man show built around a character skit from the first movie.  Murphy plays eight different roles and gives a tour de force performance without the benefit of any story whatever.  I got the impression that the writers were superfluous anyway, since Murphy was obviously ad libbing about 90% of the time.The humor is lowbrow and delivers a good deal of physical comedy laced with sexual innuendo.  Though Murphy's caricatures are consistently droll, they rely too much on unflattering stereotypes of blacks.  The first dinner scene is a rehash of the dinner scene from the first film.  After that scene, most of the film is a repetition of the same tired sight gags.  Though Murphy's amusing electricity runs through every character, once the novelty wears off the film's appeal wears thin.Kudos to the makeup department for an outstanding job on Murphy's various alter egos.  Otherwise, the production of this film was nothing out of the ordinary.  Larry Miller also gets a very honorable mention as the obnoxious Dean Richmond, getting his just deserts at the hands of a giant hamster.This film has some laughs but not enough substance for a feature length movie.

527809,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00003CXKC,Joseph Haschka,"[3, 6]","During the 3-4 months prior to Academy Award voting, the studios sponsor for the various industry guilds an abundance of free screenings of the movies thought eligible for Oscar nominations. Such screenings give the guilds' voting members, as well as the memberships at large, an opportunity to view the fruits of their labors. Each guild member can bring one guest to a screening. It was as a guest that I attended a showing of NUTTY PROFESSOR II - THE KLUMPS. The circumstances allowing me to see this movie are irrelevant, except as I refer again to the studio screenings towards the end of this review.The plot of this comedy verges on incoherent, so please bear with my poor attempt to summarize it. Eddie Murphy plays several roles as the grossly overweight members of the Klump family, including the brilliant Professor Sherman Klump, and the professor's mother, father, grandmother and uncle. Janet Jackson, playing a professorial colleague of Sherman's at a small, private college, serves dubiously as his love interest. Sherman has developed a potion that restores youth, a discovery of potentially great wealth for the college. Unfortunately, his persona also harbors his alter ego, Buddy Love, also played by Murphy, who forces him into periodic obscene or otherwise inappropriate outbursts at awkward moments. The bulk of the film - the incoherent part - revolves around Sherman's attempt to eradicate Buddy from his personality by genetic manipulation, woo the Jackson character, and win a lucrative pharmaceutical contract for his Fountain of Youth.Now, I'll be the first to admit that Eddie Murphy has great talent. In THE KLUMPS, his ability to assume multiple roles is unquestionably demonstrated. And, the costuming and make-up enabling him to pull this off are first rate. However, the plot, which relies heavily on over-the-top bathroom humor to get the laughs, is loud, chaotic and positively moronic. As I've indicated in the first paragraph, the studio, Universal in this case, apparently thinks this film of Oscar caliber by the very fact of its free screenings. Considering the evident target audience (pre-pubescent juveniles?), I cannot imagine who they think would even be available to nominate in any award category, much less vote for, this work of crude nonsense.  What could they've possibly been thinking in Universal's corridors of power? The movie's strong points (costuming and make-up), even assuming that they're equal to or better than those in Y2K's truly great films, are positively swamped in the swill.Do not buy or rent THE KLUMPS.

527817,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXKC,Matthew Horner,"[3, 4]","To be fair, The Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps must be looked at in two ways. One should look at the performances of its star, Eddie Murphy, who plays seven different characters. One should then look at how it works as a movie. Unfortunately, the latter look almost undoes the former.Once again, Eddie Murphy show what an extraordinary actor he is. He plays Sherman Klump, the brilliant, lovable, shy and grossly overweight professor. He also play's Sherman's father, mother, grandmother, brother and the foul-mouthed, bad-tempered Buddy Love, Sherman's accidental alter-ego. It is true that Murphy played those characters before in The Nutty Professor. Obviously, the novelty is absent in the sequel, but it should be noted that in the original, he played the family only in scenes where they were seated around a dinner table. This was done for budget reasons, as the star was not as 'bankable' at the time as he once had been. Murphy's back on top now, so the Klumps in this picture have left the table and are all over the place. This change made for a far more complex production schedule, as well as a horrendously complicated job for Murphy. That he pulls it off at all is amazing. That he pulls it off with style is nearly a miracle.This time Sherman Klump has invented a formula which reverses the aging process. He does this at the university lab where he works, and the dean thinks they can make [money] from it. Naturally, Buddy Love is around to make sure things go wrong, including Sherman's romance with the beautiful Denise [Janet Jackson]. In addition to all this, Sherman must still deal with his madly dysfunctional family.As for the story, it goes nowhere fast. Some scenes are quite funny, but others lack the sparkle one would hope for in such a high profile piece of entertainment. I am certain that Mr. Murphy, who often endured five hours a day in the makeup chair, had no time or energy left to devote to the plot. That was the writers' job, and I am afraid they let both us and our people-pleasing star down. Still, compared to recent letdowns such as Martin Lawrence in Big Momma's House, the movie has enough interesting moments in it to make it worth viewing.",2,Material doesn't do justice to Murphy's fine work,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,2188,"['be', 'fair', 'Nutty', 'Professor', '2', 'Klumps', 'must', 'be', 'looked', 'two', 'ways', 'One', 'should', 'look', 'performances', 'star', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'who', 'seven', 'different', 'characters', 'One', 'should', 'then', 'look', 'how', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'latter', 'look', 'almost', 'former.Once', 'again', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'show', 'what', 'extraordinary', 'actor', 'Sherman', 'Klump', 'brilliant', 'lovable', 'shy', 'grossly', 'overweight', 'professor', 'also', 'play', 'Sherman', 'father', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'brother', 'foul-mouthed', 'bad-tempered', 'Buddy', 'Love', 'Sherman', 'accidental', 'alter-ego', 'true', 'Murphy', 'played', 'characters', 'Nutty', 'Professor', 'Obviously', 'novelty', 'absent', 'sequel', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'original', 'played', 'family', 'only', 'scenes', 'where', 'were', 'seated', 'dinner', 'table', 'was', 'done', 'budget', 'reasons', 'star', 'was', 'not', ""'bankable"", 'time', 'once', 'had', 'been', 'Murphy', 'back', 'top', 'now', 'Klumps', 'picture', 'have', 'left', 'table', 'are', 'place', 'change', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'production', 'schedule', 'as', 'well', 'horrendously', 'complicated', 'job', 'Murphy', 'off', 'amazing', 'off', 'style', 'nearly', 'miracle.This', 'time', 'Sherman', 'Klump', 'invented', 'formula', 'aging', 'process', 'university', 'lab', 'where', 'dean', 'thinks', 'can', 'make', '[', 'money', ']', 'Naturally', 'Buddy', 'Love', 'make', 'sure', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'including', 'Sherman', 'romance', 'beautiful', 'Denise', '[', 'Janet', 'Jackson', ']', 'addition', 'Sherman', 'must', 'still', 'deal', 'madly', 'dysfunctional', 'family.As', 'story', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'scenes', 'are', 'quite', 'funny', 'others', 'lack', 'sparkle', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'such', 'high', 'profile', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'am', 'certain', 'Mr.', 'Murphy', 'who', 'often', 'endured', 'five', 'hours', 'day', 'makeup', 'chair', 'had', 'time', 'energy', 'left', 'devote', 'plot', 'was', 'writers', 'job', 'am', 'afraid', 'let', 'people-pleasing', 'star', 'down', 'Still', 'compared', 'recent', 'letdowns', 'such', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', 'movie', 'enough', 'interesting', 'moments', 'make', 'worth', 'viewing']",N/A

I think this version is a bit over-hyped on back of the DVD case: The only thing &quot;wilder&quot; about the Mariachi scene is that one extra risque` line that was added back to it.

527828,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXKC,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 9]","Nobody watching ""Nutty Professor II:  The Klumps"" could ever doubt either Eddie Murphy's extraordinary talent for comic impersonation nor the ingenious skill of the special effects team that has managed to bring the actor's many characters to fruition on film.  The utterly seamless merging of all Murphy's personas into a single shot is indeed something wondrous to behold.  Unfortunately, no amount of acting or technical expertise can compensate for a weak script - for a comedy is, after all, only as good as its writing.  In the case of ""NP II,"" the writing leaves a great deal to be desired.In many ways, the film's greatest strength turns out, ultimately, to be its greatest weakness.  Murphy is so good at delineating and inhabiting his characters that it is quite understandable that the filmmakers would want to apportion virtually equal time to each and every one of them.  This turns out to be a problem.  For one thing, it manages to dilute the focus of the film's storyline quite frequently.  Time and again, we find the narrative wandering back and forth between unrelated situations.  Just as we become involved in the affairs of one character, we shift over to the quandaries of another.Still, this would be acceptable if the film at least managed to be funny.  It does offer a few laughs along the way, but the film's script rarely rises above the waistline in its humor.  If a joke doesn't deal with a specific body part (and we're not talking about hands, feet and noses here), it probably deals with a bodily function either sexual or scatological in nature.  I have no personal objection to dirty jokes, but when an entire film consists of nothing BUT such jokes, the whole enterprise ultimately becomes tasteless, tedious and unpleasant.

Likewise, calling Janet Jackson a singing superstar is also an understatement. Now where would you find these two names together I hear you say? Well in the sequel to one of the funniest films ever made in recent years of course. Unless you've been hiding for the last 2 months or just never ever listen to the radio, you won't have missed the new Janet Jackson song that goes round and round in your head forever. The catchy summer tune is one of the songs that although annoying, it's kind of catchy. Well `Doesn't Really Matter' is the theme tune to the new Eddie Murphy movie - Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps. But Ms Jackson doesn't just appear on the soundtrack; she's in the movie as well! In the movie, we see the lovable 28-stone Sherman Klump return with the rest of his family entail. If you think your way back to the 1996 re-make of the Jerry Lewis Nutty Professor, then you'll remember Buddy Love, Sherman's alter-ego. Just as Professor Klump thought he'd got rid of him for good, Buddy pops up again - but not without a plan. He breaks free of Sherman's body for good and is determined to ruin his plans to we his colleague Denise Gaines played by the illustrious Janet Jackson. Sherman's new youth formula has fallen into Buddy's hands, and it looks like Klump is losing his intelligence - for good! From the beginning I knew that it was going to be a laughter packed movie because judging by the first scene, Eddie's performances as Sherman, Mama, Papa, Ernie and last but not least Grandma Klump are so believable, that it is as if they are five different people. The second most important Klump character in the film is Granny Klumps whose sexual appetite knows no bounds, and as she spots Buddy sneaking around the Klump family home, she has only one thing on her mind! As a singer, people don't realise that Janet has a long history of acting. As a child, she starred in many American sitcoms including Fame and Good Times and went on to star in the 1993 John Singleton (Shaft, Boyz N The Hood) film `Poetic Justice' alongside the late Tupac (Shakur). `I've never stopped receiving scripts since Poetic Justice,' Janet said, `but there was either a scheduling conflict, the script was too similar to Poetic Justice or I didn't really like it. But when Nutty came along, I jumped at the chance. I mean, who wouldn't want to work with Eddie?' Although as a Janet fan, you may say I'm being biased, Janet really does a good job acting here. `I really wanted people to think of me as Denise. I hope that people will be able to separate Denise from Janet.' And one genuinely can. However, the movie isn't 100% perfect. Where it faulters is in terms of a decent storyline. It felt like a bit of a re-trip to the first movie with a similar plot. The film, though, is hilarious and will have you repeating lines for days after it, but my only recommendation is that you see it twice. The first time round, you are getting to grips with the storyline, and I have to admit, because I didn't catch all the jokes, I didn't find it that funny. But when you go back a second time, as you know the basic storyline (which is there - despite what I said earlier), you can listen in for the jokes, as they are quite hard to catch sometimes. Altogether, Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps is very good - in fact it is one of the best sequels (save M:I2) that I have seen. It was always going to be difficult to follow up the success of The Nutty Professor, but seeing that it took over $45 million in its first weekend at the US Box Office, this is sure to be a hit in the UK as well.",4,Amazing!

Jim Carey he's not, but he doesn't need to be!  Recent comparisons between Carey's character in &quot;Liar Liar&quot; and Sherman Klump serve absolutely no purpose.  All things considered, Klump is pretty boring.  What a delight if Murphy ever decides to surround himself with better writers (with a deeper vision) who can provide him enough substance to showcase his talents in a more positive light.  No doubt, most of the creative juices for this shoddy material could have originated from any low class joint that doesn't bother to remove its restroom graffiti.

Janet Jackson may have been a high point, that being that she could actually act a little, but the rest of the movie was displaying what can happen when a star gets too much power, and such a large ego, that it is impossible for the film studio to say no to him.",2,"Interesting Concept, Horrible Movie",970531200,"10 3, 2000",2000,862,"['can', 'no', 'longer', 'remember', 'days', 'when', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'made', 'funny', 'movie', 'now', 'involved', 'movies', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'pad', 'wallet', 'more', 'reputation', 'comedian', 'film', 'exception', 'first', 'film', 'made', 'good', 'anount', 'money', 'someone', 'had', 'bright', 'idea', 'make', 'sequal', 'was', 'mistake', 'number', 'one', 'second', 'mistake', 'was', 'take', 'scene', 'was', 'funny', 'original', 'film', 'make', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'scene', 'entire', 'family', 'was', 'Eddie', 'huge', 'ego', 'trip', 'was', 'taken', 'out', 'now', 'very', 'poorly', 'written', 'film', 'surrounding', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'high', 'point', 'being', 'could', 'actually', 'act', 'little', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'displaying', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'when', 'star', 'too', 'much', 'power', 'large', 'ego', 'impossible', 'film', 'studio', 'say']",N/A

You just can't say enough about that Grandma.  She was the funniest character of them all.  But I do think that this movie went onto a different, deeper level.  It showed Sherman's struggles with his girlfriend and Buddy Love and soon you feel great sympathy for him.  But that's what Eddie Murphy is capable of doing.  I think only he could pull this kind of thing off.  And he does pull it off again.  But as the movie wore on the jokes got to be a little stale.  It was funny the whole way through but the characters got a little predictable.  The family scenes are very funny but sometimes too much of a good thing is not good.  Also another good thing about this movie was that you didn't have to have seen the first movie to know what is going on.  The Nutty Professor 2 was a wonderfully acted movie with a great story that did leave you with a good feeling.  4 Stars",4,Very funny,978048000,"12 29, 2000",2000,1016,"['Nutty', 'Professor', '2', 'was', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'times', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'had', 'own', 'individual', 'humor', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'Grandma', 'was', 'funniest', 'character', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'went', 'different', 'deeper', 'level', 'showed', 'Sherman', 'struggles', 'girlfriend', 'Buddy', 'Love', 'soon', 'feel', 'great', 'sympathy', 'what', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'capable', 'doing', 'think', 'only', 'could', 'pull', 'kind', 'thing', 'off', 'pull', 'off', 'again', 'movie', 'wore', 'jokes', 'got', 'be', 'little', 'stale', 'was', 'funny', 'whole', 'way', 'characters', 'got', 'little', 'predictable', 'family', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'not', 'good', 'Also', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'Nutty', 'Professor', '2', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'movie', 'great', 'story', 'did', 'leave', 'good', 'feeling', '4', 'Stars']",N/A
