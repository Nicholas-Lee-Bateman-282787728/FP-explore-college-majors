313955,A35QF1GDLAFYCL,6302468027,"A. Calabrese ""othernj""","[1, 1]","This is just a great movie.  I love fiction about the south and this film adaptation of Fannie Flagg's novel Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe is the best of the best.It is a great story, visually pleasing.  The acting by everyone is top notch.  The director and producer of this film are to be commended for finding a location to capture the mood of Flagg's novel.  Kathy Bates as the endearing, taken for granted, house wife is wonderful.  Mary Stuart Masterson as the hero of this story, Idgie Threadgoode, is captivating.  Add to this the nursing home resident, story teller, Ninny Threadgoode, played by Jessica Tandy, and you have a treat for the eyes and ears.  And we can't forget Mary-Louise Parker as Idgie's friend Ruth Jamison.Fried Green Tomatoes should be in you DVD collection.",5,Mystery and mood make for a great film,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,803,"['just', 'great', 'movie', 'love', 'fiction', 'south', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Fannie', 'Flagg', 'novel', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'Whistlestop', 'Cafe', 'best', 'best.It', 'great', 'story', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'acting', 'everyone', 'top', 'notch', 'director', 'producer', 'film', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'finding', 'location', 'capture', 'mood', 'Flagg', 'novel', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'endearing', 'taken', 'granted', 'house', 'wife', 'wonderful', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'hero', 'story', 'Idgie', 'Threadgoode', 'captivating', 'Add', 'nursing', 'home', 'resident', 'story', 'teller', 'Ninny', 'Threadgoode', 'played', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'have', 'treat', 'eyes', 'ears', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'Idgie', 'friend', 'Ruth', 'Jamison.Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'should', 'be', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

I'm reviewing it anyway.Students are regularly shocked to hear that I haven't been to the USA in 6 years. They assume I miss ""my hometown."" I explain to them that I miss my father and his lovely wife, and once in a while my gorgeous little doggies, but not my hometown.But lemme tell you about Fried Green Tomatoes, which are delicious. This is the most accurate portrayal of Southern life I've ever seen. I don't say that lightly. I've seen many films and read many books which portray Southern life quite well. Author Fannie Flagg, who I'm old enough to remember from The Match Game, nailed it. She's more twisted than the other two Southern lady authors I adore, Harper Lee and Anne Tyler, and I like that in a person. Also, it would've been a crime if Fannie hadn't popped in for a cameo, so I'm happy she did.Fried Green Tomatoes is deceptively slow moving, as is Southern life. There's a whole lot of stuff in there, however, all of which is quite accurate. The good and the bad. Many parts of it will have you cracking up with laughter, but it's not always a happy-happy load of hooey. Our deep dark secrets are also in there. Subtly. I do appreciate subtlety. I don't see it enough.I could give you a list of all the things I loved about this film. It'd be so long you wouldn't read it. So lemme just say I'll watch it again -- I don't know how many times -- and that I may very well buy the novel. I get a strong sense that the film is quite true to the novel, but I like to see these things for myself. I betcha Fannie's got a way with words. If you haven't watched this film, get it.

You know every line and all the characters, as if it had all really happened to your life? Fried Green Tomatoes is one of those movies for me. Also, I think you will be surprised at the ""real"" connections my family has to the film.Fannie Flag wrote a book about a peculiar little town called whistlestop. The newspaper has a fit about a comet falling from the sky, and all of the locals are in a dither. I live not ten minutes from there. It's in Irondale Alabama. Just a few months ago I ate in the cafe again. Its a neat place with home cooked vegitables and your choice of two meats. (Big spenders add pie.)My Aunt Ida Hathcock was one of the afore mentioned peculiar citizens. She had some whopper stories, let me tell you. But according to her, all true. Crazy bulls that pinned people to walls - fireblazin' preachers that saw the world as the lake of fire, judging at will - (While they cheated on their wives behind the church). She was a hoot. I say all that to say, she knew the original characters Miss Flagg wrote the book about... Moonshine and all. How few are the treasured stories that remain.The Film is one of my favorites. And is easily the best ""chick-flick"" ever made in my opinion. Thats not just because of my relation to the stories, I had seen the movie atleast twenty times before the connection was made about Aunt Ida.Ninny is a lady in a nursing home that sees poor Evelyn crying her eyes out on the flower patterned love-seat, looking aweful, scarfing down candy bars. Ninny, seeing an opportunity to help the poor woman, sinks the hook of a great story, leading Evelyn to pry deeper. Ninny, ""Just sit there, and I'll tell you all about it."" Murder, conspiracy, true love amongst friends, racism, loss and hope are just a few subjects skimming the surface of this wonderful tale. I love it.I could write a book, scene by scene, on the different takes and angles I have on this film. But, now is not the day for that. I'll think about that tomorrow. (-S.O.)If there is one great moral to the story, it is the one that I have learned with my Great Aunt Ida. These people live, they have wonderful adventures, touch the world, then pass. In scripture it says to seek councel from the wise. Maybe listening to a few whopper tales wouldn't hurt either.

313970,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302468027,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 8]","`Fried Green Tomatoes' is the kind of manipulative chick flick that reminds one of earlier efforts with large female casts such as `Steel Magnolias'.  Strong women remaining strong and or learning to be stronger thanks to the strong women around them.  There is no testosterone here, for this is an estrogen lovefest that completely consumes itself with its solitary purpose of female empowerment.  I made a comment on a recent review (I think it was for `Whale Rider') where I talked about how I'm not opposed to `Girl Power' but that I have an aversion to girl power movies because they are never done right (or rarely done right).I can't say that `Fried Green Tomatoes' is any different.  It just dumbs down everything far too much.  I understand that women have to fight in a world dominated by men, but I'd rather see a realistic depiction and not one bogged down so heavily by opposition that every scene really seems like a `struggle'.It takes away the films integrity.Another sore spot is the acting.  I love me some Kathy Bates, but she's always been a spotty actress.  Here she is far too light for my liking, coming off a tad insincere in her approach, but then again, the film itself is far too light for its own good.  Mary Stuart Masterson is kind of awful here.  I can't decide, between her and Mary-Louise Parker, who botches the accent more (or who overdoes it the worst).  At least with Parker, she has the actorly bravado to carry her character's arc, and she really excels in the second half of the film.  Jessica Tandy is easily the best part of the film, so jovial and exciting and effervescent (no wonder she got that Oscar nomination).The film is told in flashbacks while Tandy's character, not residing in a nursing home, tells Bates' character Evelyn about her childhood friends, Idgie and Ruth.  Both women are bonded over the loss of Idgie's brother Buddy.  The girls, growing up in the 20's and 30's, live a hard life full of death, oppression and abuse, but they come together to strengthen each other and `fight for what they believe in'.`Fried Green Tomatoes' has tonal issues.  The film has scenes too heavy for the light-hearted delivery, and yet the light-hearted delivery can be so beautiful that you almost wish the heavier scenes weren't there.  I think that Robert Redford captured a more acceptable tone in his `A River Run's Through It' to following year, taking a similar place and time and giving it a more realistic approach.  Jon Avnet's direction just clashes and makes for an uneven film.Yet, much like `Steel Magnolias' (which was also uneven), `Fried Green Tomatoes' is certainly watchable.",3,You go girl...,1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,2639,"['Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'kind', 'manipulative', 'chick', 'flick', 'one', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'large', 'female', 'casts', 'such', 'Steel', 'Magnolias', 'Strong', 'women', 'remaining', 'strong', 'learning', 'be', 'stronger', 'thanks', 'strong', 'women', 'testosterone', 'here', 'estrogen', 'lovefest', 'completely', 'solitary', 'purpose', 'female', 'empowerment', 'made', 'comment', 'recent', 'review', 'think', 'was', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'where', 'talked', 'how', ""'m"", 'not', 'opposed', 'Girl', 'Power', 'have', 'aversion', 'girl', 'power', 'movies', 'are', 'never', 'done', 'right', 'rarely', 'done', 'right', '.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'different', 'just', 'dumbs', 'down', 'everything', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'understand', 'women', 'have', 'fight', 'world', 'dominated', 'men', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'realistic', 'depiction', 'not', 'one', 'bogged', 'down', 'so', 'heavily', 'opposition', 'scene', 'really', ""struggle'.It"", 'away', 'films', 'integrity.Another', 'sore', 'spot', 'acting', 'love', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'always', 'been', 'spotty', 'actress', 'Here', 'far', 'too', 'light', 'liking', 'coming', 'off', 'tad', 'insincere', 'approach', 'then', 'again', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'light', 'own', 'good', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'kind', 'awful', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'who', 'accent', 'more', 'who', 'worst', 'least', 'Parker', 'actorly', 'bravado', 'carry', 'character', 'arc', 'really', 'excels', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'easily', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'jovial', 'exciting', 'effervescent', 'wonder', 'got', 'Oscar', 'nomination', '.The', 'film', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'Tandy', 'character', 'not', 'residing', 'nursing', 'home', 'Bates', 'character', 'Evelyn', 'childhood', 'friends', 'Idgie', 'Ruth', 'women', 'are', 'bonded', 'loss', 'Idgie', 'brother', 'Buddy', 'girls', 'growing', 'up', '20', '30', 'live', 'hard', 'life', 'full', 'death', 'oppression', 'abuse', 'come', 'together', 'strengthen', 'other', 'fight', 'what', 'believe', ""in'."", 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'tonal', 'issues', 'film', 'scenes', 'too', 'heavy', 'light-hearted', 'delivery', 'yet', 'light-hearted', 'delivery', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'beautiful', 'almost', 'wish', 'heavier', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'think', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'captured', 'more', 'acceptable', 'tone', 'River', 'Run', 'following', 'year', 'taking', 'similar', 'place', 'time', 'giving', 'more', 'realistic', 'approach', 'Jon', 'Avnet', 'direction', 'just', 'clashes', 'uneven', 'film.Yet', 'much', 'Steel', 'Magnolias', 'was', 'also', 'uneven', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'certainly', 'watchable']",N/A

I'm glad I did.Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson, Joon of Benny &) lost her older brother to a train accident when she was a little girl. She had been his favorite, and she adored him. It came very hard for her. She grew up rather wild and self-willed, which was not appropriate for a girl in the south in the 1920s.Her story is told to Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates) by Ninny Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy), who is now a very old lady in the same retirement center as Evelyn's husband's aunt (or great-aunt?). Evelyn keeps being thrown out of her husband's aunt's room every time he goes visiting, and so she struck up a conversation with Ninny Threadgoode, who told her all about Idgie.She could drink and swear and gamble and fight as well as the guys, and wore men's clothes much of the time. One summer, her mother invited her cousin Ruth (Mary-Louisa Parker) to spend the summer with them, hoping the very proper Ruth would be a good influence on Idgie. Predictably, she was a ""bad"" influence on Ruth instead.But Ruth got married. When Idgie went to visit her in her new home, she also had a black eye and bruised cheek. Idgie is irate, of course, and threatens Ruth's SOB of a husband that she will kill him if he hurts Ruth again. Eventually, when she finds out Ruth is pregnant and scared to death of her husband, Idgie takes a couple of strong arms with her and moves Ruth back to her place.The title of the movie refers to the Whistle Stop Cafe that Idgie and Ruth opened to support themselves after Ruth's baby is born and named after Idgie's lost big brother. There's some considerable hassle over the fact that her friend Sipsey (Cecily Tyson) and her son Big George run a barbecue in the back of the cafe. Segregation was still big, and in fact the KKK got involved.Bare outline here: Ruth's ex-husband was missing for some five years, and then his truck was dredged out of the river. Because someone remembered hearing Idgie threaten him, she and Big George stand trial for murder, even though the body was never found. If you want to know how it turns out, you'll have to get the movie and see for yourself.",5,A Women's Masterpiece,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,2234,"['Well', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'one', 'was', 'new', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'get', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.Idgie', 'Threadgoode', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'Joon', 'Benny', 'lost', 'older', 'brother', 'train', 'accident', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'had', 'been', 'favorite', 'adored', 'came', 'very', 'hard', 'grew', 'up', 'rather', 'wild', 'self-willed', 'was', 'not', 'appropriate', 'girl', 'south', '1920s.Her', 'story', 'told', 'Evelyn', 'Couch', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Ninny', 'Threadgoode', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'who', 'now', 'very', 'old', 'lady', 'same', 'retirement', 'center', 'Evelyn', 'husband', 'aunt', 'great-aunt', 'Evelyn', 'being', 'thrown', 'husband', 'aunt', 'room', 'time', 'visiting', 'so', 'struck', 'up', 'conversation', 'Ninny', 'Threadgoode', 'who', 'told', 'Idgie.She', 'could', 'drink', 'swear', 'gamble', 'fight', 'as', 'well', 'guys', 'wore', 'men', 'clothes', 'much', 'time', 'One', 'summer', 'mother', 'invited', 'cousin', 'Ruth', 'Mary-Louisa', 'Parker', 'spend', 'summer', 'hoping', 'very', 'proper', 'Ruth', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'influence', 'Idgie', 'Predictably', 'was', 'bad', 'influence', 'Ruth', 'instead.But', 'Ruth', 'got', 'married', 'When', 'Idgie', 'went', 'visit', 'new', 'home', 'also', 'had', 'black', 'eye', 'bruised', 'cheek', 'Idgie', 'irate', 'course', 'Ruth', 'SOB', 'husband', 'will', 'kill', 'Ruth', 'again', 'Eventually', 'when', 'out', 'Ruth', 'pregnant', 'scared', 'death', 'husband', 'Idgie', 'couple', 'strong', 'arms', 'moves', 'Ruth', 'back', 'place.The', 'title', 'movie', 'refers', 'Whistle', 'Stop', 'Cafe', 'Idgie', 'Ruth', 'opened', 'support', 'Ruth', 'baby', 'born', 'named', 'Idgie', 'lost', 'big', 'brother', 'considerable', 'hassle', 'fact', 'friend', 'Sipsey', 'Cecily', 'Tyson', 'son', 'Big', 'George', 'run', 'barbecue', 'back', 'cafe', 'Segregation', 'was', 'still', 'big', 'fact', 'KKK', 'got', 'involved.Bare', 'outline', 'here', 'Ruth', 'ex-husband', 'was', 'missing', 'five', 'years', 'then', 'truck', 'was', 'dredged', 'river', 'someone', 'remembered', 'hearing', 'Idgie', 'threaten', 'Big', 'George', 'stand', 'trial', 'murder', 'even', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'out', ""'ll"", 'have', 'get', 'movie', 'see']",N/A

I'm ashamed over the fact that in the back of my mind for SO many years now, I assumed Fried Green Tomatoes is a chick flick.  A film only women can understand and appreciate.  This is the reason I avoided it for so many years.A chick flick? NOT AT ALL!  This is actually a really good family movie, or an incredibly moving emotional drama if you wish.The reason everyone loves Fried Green Tomatoes is because it does absolutely everything right.  The happy scenes make you feel happy, the sad scenes make you wanna grab a tissue, and the angry scenes... yeah you get the idea.  It's true though, and whenever a movie is able to move the viewer in such a way that they themselves feel the same emotions as the characters on screen, *that* my friends is how you know you're watching a fantastic and brilliantly executed storyline.Kathy Bates all by *herself* makes the overall rating shoot up a few points.  That's how fondly I think of her as an actress. She's just absolutely terrific every single time I watch her performance no matter WHAT the storyline is about.  She completely amazes me time and time again.  In Fried Green Tomatoes, you get to witness Kathy Bates go through several experiences as she portrays a normal housewife just looking for something to spice up her life.  Looking for something to take away the redundant-ness.The storyline is about Kathy's character making constant visits to an old woman in a retirement home, and getting to know the old woman a little bit more with each visit.  Kathy eventually visits the old woman enough times that Kathy's personality begins to change (just WAIT until you see a really hilarious scene involving a parking lot incident!!)However, the meat and potatoes of the storyline is a personal, life changing story that the old woman shares with Kathy.  It's a story involving the old woman reflecting on her younger years as she goes through her child, teenager, and adult life.As the story the old woman tells unfolds more and more, you not only get to know the old woman better, but you see how her stories are affecting Kathy Bates character as well.  WHAT a story she tells too.  Wow!Also, the production of this film is amazing.  It seriously does NOT look like it's 20 years old- it feels like it's about 5 years old.  Nothing about the picture looks dated to me.  Just a wonderful job there.Yes, this movie truly deserves the many perfect 5 star ratings it has received here on amazon.  I'm still angry at myself for avoiding such a classic film for... geez, nearly 20 years now.  That's just pure stubbornness right there, haha.  Don't wait 20 *years* like I did!!

It's a gentle, beautiful film about friendship and how relationships can help us grow as human beings. It's lovely to look at. The sequences from 1930's Alabama are lush and rich in lighting, color and costume (outstanding cinematography by Geoffrey Simpson). Fanny Flagg's and Carol Sobieski's script is moving as the characters lack Southern rural stereotypes and are displayed as individuals and real people.As expected, excellent performances from Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker. Anyone of them could have walked away with an Oscar. To Ms. Parker's credit, her performance here could have catapulted her to vast commercial success, yet she followed her muse and heart via the theater instead. Although the various stories and themes are interesting, funny, nostalgic and sometimes tragic, the film is driven more by the characters and how the Evelyn/Ninny relationship (Bates/Tandy) parallels Ruth/Idgie (Parker/Masterson).

In the 1980s, it was Steel Magnolias and in the 1990s it was Fried Green Tomatoes, a southern folktale based on the novel by Fannie Flagg (who also co-wrote the screenplay).Fried Green Tomatoes is a beautiful shot film that really evokes the rich, lush setting of the Deep South. Director Jon Avnet also uses warm colours to create an inviting atmosphere that draws the audience in. There is real artistic integrity to the camerawork which gives the film a Classic Hollywood vibe.Fried Green Tomatoes is the perfect lazy Sunday summer afternoon movie that evokes simpler times. The film makes us appreciate taking the time out of our busy lives to stop and smell the roses as it were. The film espouses a simple yet important message of tolerance and compassion towards one another but not in a preachy way. It is a message that is certainly applicable today (maybe even more so) making Fried Green Tomatoes even more relevant.There are a collection of ""Deleted Scenes"" that are really just little bits of added footage tagged on at the end of or in-between scenes. There is nothing too memorable here.Also included, is an amusing collection of ""Outtakes,"" featuring flubs and blown lines.""Moments of Discovery: The Making of Fried Green Tomatoes"" is an engaging, endearing retrospective documentary that runs just over an hour. Good news for fans is that Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker contribute new interviews and warmly recall filming anecdotes, including working in the intense Georgian heat, how Masterson really handled all those bees and Parker's run-in with some nasty leeches. This is a must-watch for any fan of this movie.""Sipsey's Recipes"" include actual recipes for over 15 dishes that are taken from Flagg's book and that allow you to recreate the Whistle Stop Caf&eacute;'s cuisine. This is a really nice touch.""Jon Avnet's Director's Notes"" includes script excerpts with specific directions he used as a guide when making the movie.There are ""Production Photographs"" that include behind-the-scenes pics of the delicious food and also the movie crew at work.""Poster Campaign"" features various poster designs for the movie, including some really nice hand-drawn ones that are quite artistic in nature.Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Jon Avnet.

Pure tom boy, none of the others in her home seem to understand her.  Witnessing Buddy's terrible death firsthand only causes Idgie to become withdrawn and strangely eccentric as time goes on.Thinking that only one other person can draw her out of this cocoon of grief and reaction--Ruth, the girlfriend Buddy left behind who also witnessed the same train accident--Idgie's mother calls Ruth home for a summer.  Now a young woman, Idgie seems one part tomboy, and two parts a strange kind of 1930's train-riding Beatnick (albeit a bit early for that.)The two women forge a powerful relationship, one that sees them through abusive marriage, murder, and a unique kind of love.Highly recommended for women of all ages, but don't be surprised if you need your hankies.Deidre",5,"A Bittersweet, Sometimes Melancholy Story of Enduring Friendship and Love",1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,1104,"['girl', 'power', 'movie', 'surface', 'larger', 'scale', 'how', 'loss', 'grief', 'have', 'far-reaching', 'effects.When', 'Idgie', 'Threadgood', 'older', 'brother', 'Buddy', 'killed', 'freak', 'train', 'accident', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'watch', 'part', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'big', 'brother', 'Pure', 'tom', 'boy', 'none', 'others', 'home', 'seem', 'understand', 'Witnessing', 'Buddy', 'terrible', 'death', 'firsthand', 'only', 'Idgie', 'become', 'withdrawn', 'strangely', 'eccentric', 'time', 'on.Thinking', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'person', 'can', 'draw', 'cocoon', 'grief', 'reaction', 'Ruth', 'girlfriend', 'Buddy', 'left', 'behind', 'who', 'also', 'witnessed', 'same', 'train', 'accident', 'Idgie', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'home', 'summer', 'Now', 'young', 'woman', 'Idgie', 'one', 'part', 'tomboy', 'two', 'parts', 'strange', 'kind', '1930', 'train-riding', 'Beatnick', 'bit', 'early', 'two', 'women', 'forge', 'powerful', 'relationship', 'one', 'abusive', 'marriage', 'murder', 'unique', 'kind', 'love.Highly', 'recommended', 'women', 'ages', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'need', 'hankies.Deidre']",N/A

314008,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6302468027,D. Litton,"[23, 26]","Get out the tissues and get ready for laughs and tears as Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy dish out the humor and the sadness that makes &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; such a popular hit among all types of people. The movie is a stunning vignette of life in a time gone by, regailed by an witty old lady to an aging woman who feels her femininity slipping through her fingers. The movie proves that the simplest elements of any friendship are those that are strong enough to survive any ordeal, and it tells this in such a way that one cannot help but enjoy it. For me, the movie strikes such a deep chord within my heart that it kept me captivated throughout: its powerful performances and emotional story is depressing and funny, but proves to be uplifting and joyful.The story centers around the unlikely friendship between octegenarian Ninny Threadgood, who resides at a nursing home that the menopausal Evelyn Couch happens to be visiting one day. The two meet, and Ninny begins to tell her the story of a young, rebellious girl named Igdy Threadgood, who is devastated by the death of her brother Buddy and alienates herself from her family and few friends. Captivated by the conversation, Evelyn cannot help but return for more of the story, and thus begins a close friendship between the two.Ninny's story continues into a mesmerizing tale of emotional strength and courage of two women who refused to allow anything stand in their way. Idgy soon makes her way back into her family's life, with the help of Buddy's sweetheart, Ruth Jamison. Ruth is good-natured and proper, but soon learns the ways of fun and giddiness from Idgy's rambunctious tactics. Their frienship soon begins to flounder when Ruth's marriage separates them, but upon learning that Ruth is being beaten by her husband, she comes to the rescue in a heartbeat. Upon the opening of a restaurant, their relationship grows stronger, ultimately proving that it can survive anything.And there are even more hardships in store for them, ones that cannot be disclosed for fear of giving too much of the suspenseful and sometimes hilarious ending away. There is a mystery involving the characters of the past, one that brings us into its arms and holds tight until the final resolution.Crossed with Ninny's story is the present-day life of Evelyn, whose menopausal outbursts provide some of the funniest film moments to date. Her marriage is all but fulfilling, as displayed in her attempts to get her husband &quot;in the mood.&quot; Attending classes in order to try and rediscover her femininity only succeeds in making her look and feel more foolish. And her sweet nature will not allow her to stand up for herself in any way, shape or form. This is where Ninny's story has such an uplifting impact on her: through the stories of Ruth and Idgy, Evelyn is able to turn her life into the one she has always wanted, with hilarious results.Ninny's story is universal in its themes, but is set in the 1930's in the fictional Southern town of Whistle Stop, which is decribed by Ninny as &quot;a little knock-about place.&quot; The movie doesn't just bring that time and place to life, but instead reincarnates it through vivid use of authentic set designs and costumes. Everything about this film oozes of this period in time, which is essential to a movie whose setting revolves around it. I was more than convinced by it, which allowed me to pay attention to the more important aspects the movie serves up.Its many themes are gloriously portrayed through the two friendships, in different ways and mannerisms. Ruth and Idgy have such a strong bond, and they were able to sell me on that friendship, which is what wins the movie over for me. Their willingness to do anything for one another, and I do mean anything, inspires a very warm feeling of devotion and emotional ties. The friendship between Evelyn and Ninny is so special because of the circumstances under which they meet as well as the many ways in which Ninny inspires Evelyn to take charge of her life. Like Idgy and Ruth, they are there for one another when the going gets tough, which strengthens their bond and keeps their friendship intriguing to watch unfold.The movie is full of so many elements: laughter, heartwarming emotion, depression, and tears. The laughter comes from the mischievous machinations of Ruth and Idgy, as well as from Evelyn's reawakening. The emotion comes from watching the devotion of these friends, and the lengths they go to for one another. And the tears... they are not so much tears of sadness as they are tears of joy for the message of friendship and togetherness that the movie shouts out. This story speaks to us on so many different levels, and it reaches all of these levels with peak intensity and success.The defining work in this film comes from the incredibly strong performances of the four actresses who bring their characters to life with a brilliant deluge of emotion. Jessica Tandy portrays Ninny with a charm and spry wit that makes her character loveable and realistic. Kathy Bates is a knock-out as Evelyn, and her incredible performance as a woman on the brink of losing her mind and then finding her true happiness is impeccable and delightful. Both Tandy and Bates garnered Academy Awards for their work in this film. Mary Stuart Masterson is the tomboyish Idgy, bringing out all of her character's traits and characteristics meticulously and, it appears, with incredible ease. Mary Louise Parker is convincing as the well-rounded Ruth, retaining her proper ways yet never allowing them to interfere with their friendship.I was highly entertained in many different ways by &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes.&quot; The performances were solid and convincing. The characters were intriguing and genuine, emotional and moving. The story speaks out in many ways about the ties of friendship and love, while harnessing all of its themes and messages together without falling short on delivering them. The film proves itself to be a worthy human drama with a solid backbone.",5,Immensely entertaining in many diverse ways.,987638400,"04 19, 2001",2001,6048,"['Get', 'out', 'tissues', 'get', 'ready',

314014,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,6302468027,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[7, 23]","This film was pretty much what I expected, from both word of mouth and packaging: a somewhat predictable and manipulative tear-jerker (read: soap!) rife with made-for-TV cliches but still well directed/written enough to be fairly enjoyable, with one fairly original and intriguing main character played by Mary Stuart Masterson.  There were parts so trite and corny I felt compelled to leave the room (e.g. the wife-beating husband) but otherwise the movie held my attention pretty well.It really is a story within a story, with the present-day protagonist (Bates) being inspired and, in typical Hollywood fashion, transformed by the story she's told by a woman she meets while visiting an in-law at the local nursing home---Jessica Tandy, who is easily the most radiant and splendid woman in the cast.There is a quasi-feminist subtext of women empowering themselves and other women, which I wish had been developed in greater detail and on a less superficial level and with fewer cliches.  But at least there's a subtext in the first place, something usually missing in these types of films which just concentrate on making you identify with the characters and cry/laugh on cue.Good light entertainment, on the whole.

Evelyn is a sweet and kind woman, but shows she has a more feisty side in the very funny parking lot scene.It was also a joy watching the relationship between Evelyn and Mrs. Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy) develop.Their relationship provided comic relief and a brighter light that shone over the darker main story.The main story involves two females, Idgy (Mary Stuart Masterson) and Ruth (Mary-Louise Parker) whose friendship began reluctantly and later turns into a best friendship.While their friendship develops, it seems like Idgy is romantically courting Ruth. For example, there's a scene where they're both boarding a train and Idgy reaches her hand down (like a gentleman) to help delicate Ruth onto the train. In another scene, Idgy impresses Ruth by showing her how she can charm bees. When a shocked but charmed Ruth asks her why she did it, Idgy replies, ""I did it just for you.""A very sweet gesture, but also kind of a romantic, too. There's a scene where Idgy kisses Ruth on the cheek and although they don't make out or anything, it did imply Idgy might be a lesbian...especially since she also doesn't date men and also dresses like a man.Whether the friendship is romantic or not, though, it's a strong one. These women go to great lengths to protect one another when they need it the most.Besides depicting friendship in this movie, slavery is also depicted. White people are shown as both cruel and loving towards slaves (with Idgy and Ruth being on the loving team). One thing that might upset people is seeing slaves depicted as happy slaves enjoying having a master. One slave even sings happily while he works.There's a plot twist involving this same slave that is both clever and disgusting.This movie can be a little slow at times. I understand two simultaneous stories take time to develop, but I still thought the pacing could've been sped up a bit.There were also some inconsistencies, too. For example, in one flashback, Idgy is a little girl and Ruth is a young woman. But in another flashback, both Idgy and Ruth look the same age.Also, the ending implies that Mrs. Threadgoode was actually Idgy all along.  However, in the beginning, Mrs. Threadgoode announced herself as Idgy's sister-in-law...so either she's lying about being Idgy's sister-in-law or she's lying about being Idgy. The ending doesn't clear that up.Also, although Idgy is a genuinely good-hearted and brave person, she's also a smoker, a thief, and a prankster at church which makes it hard to consider her a role model.But overall, though, I consider this a warm-hearted and clever movie.",3,Two stories about female bonding,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,2718,"['was', 'joy', 'watching', 'Evelyn', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'transforming', 'emotional', 'eater', 'someone', 'wanting', 'take', 'better', 'care', 'herself', 'Evelyn', 'sweet', 'kind', 'woman', 'more', 'feisty', 'side', 'very', 'funny', 'parking', 'lot', 'scene.It', 'was', 'also', 'joy', 'watching', 'relationship', 'Evelyn', 'Mrs.', 'Threadgoode', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'develop.Their', 'relationship', 'provided', 'comic', 'relief', 'brighter', 'light', 'shone', 'darker', 'main', 'story.The', 'main', 'story', 'two', 'females', 'Idgy', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'Ruth', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'friendship', 'began', 'reluctantly', 'later', 'best', 'friendship.While', 'friendship', 'Idgy', 'romantically', 'courting', 'Ruth', 'example', 'scene', 'where', ""'re"", 'boarding', 'train', 'Idgy', 'hand', 'down', 'gentleman', 'help', 'delicate', 'Ruth', 'train', 'scene', 'Idgy', 'Ruth', 'showing', 'how', 'can', 'charm', 'bees', 'When', 'shocked', 'charmed', 'Ruth', 'why', 'did', 'Idgy', 'did', 'just', 'very', 'sweet', 'gesture', 'also', 'kind', 'romantic', 'too', 'scene', 'where', 'Idgy', 'Ruth', 'cheek', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'out', 'anything', 'did', 'imply', 'Idgy', 'might', 'be', 'lesbian', 'especially', 'also', ""n't"", 'date', 'men', 'also', 'man.Whether', 'friendship', 'romantic', 'not', 'strong', 'one', 'women', 'go', 'great', 'lengths', 'protect', 'one', 'when', 'need', 'most.Besides', 'depicting', 'friendship', 'movie', 'slavery', 'also', 'depicted', 'White', 'people', 'are', 'shown', 'cruel', 'loving', 'towards', 'slaves', 'Idgy', 'Ruth', 'being', 'loving', 'team', 'One', 'thing', 'might', 'upset', 'people', 'seeing', 'slaves', 'depicted', 'happy', 'slaves', 'enjoying', 'having', 'master', 'One', 'slave', 'even', 'sings', 'happily', 'plot', 'twist', 'involving', 'same', 'slave', 'clever', 'disgusting.This', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'slow', 'times', 'understand', 'two', 'simultaneous', 'stories', 'take', 'time', 'develop', 'still', 'thought', 'pacing', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sped', 'up', 'bit.There', 'were', 'also', 'inconsistencies', 'too', 'example', 'one', 'flashback', 'Idgy', 'little', 'girl', 'Ruth', 'young', 'woman', 'flashback', 'Idgy', 'Ruth', 'look', 'same', 'age.Also', 'ending', 'implies', 'Mrs.', 'Threadgoode', 'was', 'actually', 'Idgy', 'along', 'However', 'beginning', 'Mrs.', 'Threadgoode', 'announced', 'Idgy', 'sister-in-law', 'so', 'lying', 'being', 'Idgy', 'sister-in-law', 'lying', 'being', 'Idgy', 'ending', ""n't"", 'clear', 'up.Also', 'Idgy', 'genuinely', 'good-hearted', 'brave', 'person', 'also', 'smoker', 'thief', 'prankster', 'church', 'hard', 'consider', 'role', 'model.But', 'overall', 'consider', 'warm-hearted', 'clever', 'movie']",N/A

314018,A1SW80RQNB3DMK,6302468027,EquesNiger,"[17, 19]","I'm always surprised how badly great storytelling makes it to the screen. Particularly, great Southern stories, which tend to make it to the big screen replete with caricatures and stereotypes. I recall, with particular sadness, the movie adaptation of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. While this adaptation to the screen of Flagg's tremendously moving novel does have its share of simple, stereotypical southern ""archetypes"", these are largely drawn from Flagg's book, and are largely essential to the story. It is, without a doubt, one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen and, ten years after first seeing it, it still brings raucous laughter and tears to my eyes. It's the classic ""story within the story"", and begins with the introduction of a tenacious elderly widow to a repressed younger southern housewife in a nursing home in rural Alabama. What starts off to the housewife as polite and indulgent small talk of past acquaintances with a likely senile elderly woman turns rapidly into an engrossing story with what must be the best ""hook line"" in storytelling (""Why anybody would have thought she killed that man is beyond me!""). This story then becomes a parable which the housewife uses to change her life for the better.While certainly a moral parable of the greater value systems of past times, and of loyalty and courage in the face of bigotry and oppression, the story never loses its infectious humor, despite some genuinely tragic events. The lesbian theme of the book is only mildly hinted at, and one would almost overlook it were one not to deliberately search for it. Some of the more brutal aspects of the book are retained, with the rampant racism and wife-abuse still harrowingly reflected, if toned down. Consequently, younger viewers may best appreciate the film in the company of an adult. Regardless, this is one of the best ""feeling good"" movies I have ever seen, and being a Southerner from an area very near that depicted in the book, makes me pine for the South in profound ways. It's a film about empowerment and, more importantly, the empowerment one gains through friends, and through standing up for one's friends, and through an unshakable belief in self-respect.No little credit for the success of the film goes to the incredibly strong performances of Masterson as the tom-boyish Idgie Threadgood, and Marie Louise-Parker as Ruth Jamison, along with the underrated performance of Stan Shaw, one of TV's great character actors, as Big George. However, the film's strongest performances come from three grande dames of the screen (and stage): Cicely Tyson, as Sissy, Jessica Tandy, as Ninny Threadgood, and Kathy Bates, as Evelyn Couch. While Tandy and Bates have received their due, Tyson's performance, as always, is often overlooked.",5,Great Southern Storytelling on the Screen,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,2791,"[""'m"", 'always', 'surprised', 'how', 'badly', 'great', 'storytelling', 'screen', 'Particularly', 'great', 'Southern', 'stories', 'tend', 'make', 'big', 'screen', 'replete', 'caricatures', 'stereotypes', 'recall', 'particular', 'sadness', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Midnight', 'Garden', 'Good', 'Evil', 'adaptation', 'screen', 'Flagg', 'tremendously', 'moving', 'novel', 'have', 'share', 'simple', 'stereotypical', 'southern', 'archetypes', 'are', 'largely', 'drawn', 'Flagg', 'book', 'are', 'largely', 'essential', 'story', 'doubt', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'ten', 'years', 'first', 'seeing', 'still', 'raucous', 'laughter', 'tears', 'eyes', 'classic', 'story', 'story', 'introduction', 'tenacious', 'elderly', 'widow', 'repressed', 'younger', 'southern', 'housewife', 'nursing', 'home', 'rural', 'Alabama', 'What', 'housewife', 'polite', 'indulgent', 'small', 'talk', 'past', 'acquaintances', 'likely', 'senile', 'elderly', 'woman', 'rapidly', 'engrossing', 'story', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'best', 'hook', 'line', 'storytelling', 'Why', 'anybody', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'killed', 'man', 'story', 'then', 'parable', 'housewife', 'change', 'life', 'better.While', 'certainly', 'moral', 'parable', 'greater', 'value', 'systems', 'past', 'times', 'loyalty', 'courage', 'face', 'bigotry', 'oppression', 'story', 'never', 'infectious', 'humor', 'genuinely', 'tragic', 'events', 'lesbian', 'theme', 'book', 'only', 'mildly', 'hinted', 'one', 'would', 'almost', 'overlook', 'were', 'one', 'not', 'deliberately', 'search', 'more', 'brutal', 'aspects', 'book', 'are', 'retained', 'rampant', 'racism', 'wife-abuse', 'still', 'harrowingly', 'reflected', 'toned', 'down', 'Consequently', 'younger', 'viewers', 'may', 'best', 'appreciate', 'film', 'company', 'adult', 'Regardless', 'one', 'best', 'feeling', 'good', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'being', 'Southerner', 'area', 'very', 'depicted', 'book', 'pine', 'South', 'profound', 'ways', 'film', 'empowerment', 'more', 'importantly', 'empowerment', 'one', 'gains', 'friends', 'standing', 'up', 'one', 'friends', 'unshakable', 'belief', 'self-respect.No', 'little', 'credit', 'success', 'film', 'incredibly', 'strong', 'performances', 'Masterson', 'tom-boyish', 'Idgie', 'Threadgood', 'Marie', 'Louise-Parker', 'Ruth', 'Jamison', 'underrated', 'performance', 'Stan', 'Shaw', 'one', 'TV', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'Big', 'George', 'However', 'film', 'strongest', 'performances', 'come', 'three', 'grande', 'dames', 'screen', 'stage', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'Sissy', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'Ninny', 'Threadgood', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Evelyn', 'Couch', 'Tandy', 'Bates', 'have', 'received', 'due', 'Tyson', 'performance', 'always', 'often', 'overlooked']",N/A

Go to marriage counseling, make her husbands dinner, and go to bed. That is until she meets Ninny (Jessica Tandy) an elderly lady living in a rest home near her house. Evelyns curiosity is growing as Ninny tells a story about two women she knew in time. The story is about stubborn Idgie (Mary Stuart-Masterson) who has stayed away from home ever since her older brothers death. Her and Ruth (Mary Louise-Parker) a family friend come to visit for the summer start to hit it off, and son become the best of friends. While Idgie the bee charmer collects honey, Ruth gets out more and learns to have fun. As the two become even closer, they decided, why not start a business? In the sleepy town of Whistle Stop, Ruth and Idgies cafe shall add a little spice to the town, and even attract some out of town visitors. Whether welcome, or unwelcome, the customers will play a big role in the story. Through everything, abusive husbands, Ku Klux Klansman, Trains, and deaths, the two will stay close friends. Evelyn is soon also giving herself more self respect, and is coming back more and more to hear Niny's story, even becoming part of the story herself. Ninny and Evelyn soon become close friends too, and learn the valuable lesson to like things while they last.Impeccable. Everything about this movie is flawless.

The result is a well performed but somewhat uneasy mixture of sentiment, comedy and soap opera.In terms of story, the film operates on two levels. An increasingly frustrated middleaged woman living in Alabama (Bates) examine her life and finds it sadly lacking--but by chance she makes the acquaintance of a nursing home resident (Tandy) whose stories of the past encourage the woman to take charge of her life. The stories she tells are shown through flashback, and concern two depression-era women (Mary Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson) who owned and operated a ramshackle diner in a small hard-times town called whistle stop. The present-day story emphasises comedy while the depression-era story tends more toward soap opera elements, and the two stories sometimes prove an uneasy mix. A great fuss is often made over the implied lesbian relationship between the two leads in the depression-era story, but I myself find this more in the eye of the beholder than in the actual film; it rather depends on how you read the characters.Much of the film is enjoyable, particularly in its performances with Bates a standout. The dreamy quality in which the depression-era story is presented is also nicely done. But the action is sometimes slow and the tone is both predictable and manipulative; I can almost hear the director telling me ""laugh now; cry now"" as the film progresses. Enjoyable for one, perhaps even two viewings, but not a film to which I greatly care to return--I'll take the more interesting novel instead.",3,"Sentiment, Soap Opera, and A Dash of Comedy",1009670400,"12 30, 2001",2001,1661,"['Fannie', 'Flag', 'interesting', 'novel', 'gallon', 'gloss', 'very', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'clearly', 'created', 'female', 'audience', 'mind', 'result', 'well', 'performed', 'somewhat', 'uneasy', 'mixture', 'sentiment', 'comedy', 'soap', 'opera.In', 'terms', 'story', 'film', 'two', 'levels', 'increasingly', 'frustrated', 'middleaged', 'woman', 'living', 'Alabama', 'Bates', 'examine', 'life', 'sadly', 'lacking', 'chance', 'acquaintance', 'nursing', 'home', 'resident', 'Tandy', 'stories', 'past', 'encourage', 'woman', 'take', 'charge', 'life', 'stories', 'tells', 'are', 'shown', 'flashback', 'concern', 'two', 'depression-era', 'women', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'who', 'owned', 'operated', 'ramshackle', 'diner', 'small', 'hard-times', 'town', 'called', 'whistle', 'stop', 'present-day', 'story', 'emphasises', 'comedy', 'depression-era', 'story', 'more', 'soap', 'opera', 'elements', 'two', 'stories', 'sometimes', 'prove', 'uneasy', 'mix', 'great', 'fuss', 'often', 'made', 'over', 'implied', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'two', 'leads', 'depression-era', 'story', 'myself', 'find', 'more', 'eye', 'beholder', 'actual', 'film', 'rather', 'how', 'read', 'characters.Much', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'particularly', 'performances', 'Bates', 'standout', 'dreamy', 'quality', 'depression-era', 'story', 'presented', 'also', 'nicely', 'done', 'action', 'sometimes', 'slow', 'tone', 'predictable', 'manipulative', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'director', 'telling', 'laugh', 'now', 'cry', 'now', 'film', 'Enjoyable', 'one', 'perhaps', 'even', 'two', 'viewings', 'not', 'film', 'greatly', 'care', 'return', ""'ll"", 'take', 'more', 'interesting', 'novel', 'instead']",N/A

So it is with the now 15 year old film FRIED GREEN TOMATOES based on the novel 'Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe' by Fannie Flagg and arranged for the screen by that author. This is a film that explores racism, feminism, respect for the elderly, women's rights, and so very much more in a manner that is infectious to watch repeatedly and defies forgetting.Told on two levels, the film is narrated by the elderly Ninny Threadgoode (a luminous Jessica Tandy) who idles away her hours in her nursing home with stories about her childhood she shares with the sad, obese, emotionally fragile Evelyn (Kathy Bates) whose life of misery is slowly corrected by Ninny's tales of how two women in the past overcame impossible odds.  The story she tells dates back to Alabama in the 1930s when a young upstart Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson) is calmed by a frightened but solid Ruth Jamison (Mary-Louise Parker) and how their partnering results in a series of events that involve murder, racism, and some very strange events.The cast is superb, the script is delicious (!), and Jon Avnet directs with aplomb not only the fresh talent mentioned above, but also such fine actors as Cicely Tyson, Chris O'Donnell, Stan Shaw, Lois Smith and a large cast of supporting actors.  The re-creation of the Old South is palpably well focused as is the hilarious and touching stance from the contemporary standpoint of the nursing home and house of the chameleon Evelyn.

They are executed to near perfection by actresses Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson, Mary-Louise Parker and Jessica Tandy.Adapted from from Fannie Flagg's novel, Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, the film tells two fascinating, intertwining stories.The first centers on the Bates character, a middle-aged woman attempting to make sense of life and menopause. She meets a nursing home resident played by Tandy, whom she visits for solace. Tandy shares her recollections of life in her hometown of Whistle Stop, which become the film's second story.Tandy and Bates are excellent, as one might expect from two Oscar winners. The star turns, however, come courtesy of Parker and Masterson; their performances make the flashback sequences the most beautiful and telling parts of the film.Though some might dismiss Fried Green Tomatoes as strictly the stuff of sentimentalists, it offers more than just good feelings. In one scene, there is a surprising act of violence that culminates in a scene of disgustingly fitting logic, and racial attitudes are also explored.No matter how you slice it, Fried Green Tomatoes is a feast of delectable entertainment.",4,A feast of delectable entertainment,1011916800,"01 25, 2002",2002,1391,"['era', 'where', 'most', 'women', 'film', 'roles', 'are', 'confined', 'stereotypical', 'sex', 'objects', 'second', 'bananas', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air.The', 'film', 'directed', 'Jon', 'Avnet', 'not', 'one', 'four', 'strong', 'women', 'roles', 'are', 'executed', 'perfection', 'actresses', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'Jessica', 'Tandy.Adapted', 'Fannie', 'Flagg', 'novel', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'Whistle', 'Stop', 'Cafe', 'film', 'two', 'fascinating', 'intertwining', 'stories.The', 'first', 'centers', 'Bates', 'character', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'attempting', 'make', 'sense', 'life', 'menopause', 'nursing', 'home', 'resident', 'played', 'Tandy', 'whom', 'solace', 'Tandy', 'shares', 'recollections', 'life', 'hometown', 'Whistle', 'Stop', 'become', 'film', 'second', 'story.Tandy', 'Bates', 'are', 'excellent', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'two', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'star', 'however', 'come', 'courtesy', 'Parker', 'Masterson', 'performances', 'make', 'flashback', 'most', 'beautiful', 'telling', 'parts', 'film.Though', 'might', 'dismiss', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'strictly', 'stuff', 'sentimentalists', 'more', 'just', 'good', 'feelings', 'one', 'scene', 'surprising', 'act', 'violence', 'scene', 'disgustingly', 'fitting', 'logic', 'racial', 'attitudes', 'are', 'also', 'explored.No', 'matter', 'how', 'slice', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'feast', 'delectable', 'entertainment']",N/A

Directed by Jon Avnet and written by Fannie Flagg and Carol Sobieski, it stars Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Mary-Louise Parker. It tells the story of a Depression-era friendship between two women, Ruth and Idgie, and a 1980s friendship between Evelyn, a middle-aged housewife, and Ninny, an elderly woman who knew Ruth and Idgie. The centerpiece and parallel story concerns the murder of Ruth's abusive husband and the accusations that follow.The film received a generally positive reception from film critics and was nominated for two Academy Awards. The filmmakers drew criticism from some reviewers for removing the lesbian content of the book's plot, but the film won a GLAAD Media Award for ""best lesbian content"".Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates), a timid, unhappy housewife in her forties, meets elderly Ninny Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy) in a Birmingham, Alabama, nursing home. Ninny, over several encounters with Evelyn, tells her the story of the now-abandoned town of Whistle Stop, Alabama, and the people who lived there. The film's subplot concerns Evelyn's dissatisfaction with her marriage and her life, her growing confidence, and her developing friendship with Ninny. The narrative switches several times between Ninny's story, which is set between World War I and World War II, and Evelyn's life in 1980s Birmingham.Ninny's story begins with tomboy Imogene ""Idgie"" Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson), the youngest of the Threadgoode children, whom Ninny describes as her sister-in-law. Idgie's close relationship with her charming older brother Buddy (Chris O'Donnell) is cut short when he is hit by a train and killed. Devastated, Idgie recedes from formal society for much of her childhood and adolescence until Buddy's former girlfriend, the straitlaced Ruth Jamison (Mary-Louise Parker), intervenes at the request of the concerned Threadgoode family.Idgie initially resists Ruth's attempts at friendship, but then gradually allows a deep attachment to develop. Ruth leaves Whistle Stop to marry Frank Bennett (Nick Searcy) and moves to Valdosta, Georgia. Idgie is upset at losing her friend and struggles to forget her. After some time she visits Ruth, now pregnant and suffering from physical abuse from Frank. Against Frank's wishes, Ruth returns to Whistle Stop with Idgie, where her child, named Buddy Jr., is born. Papa Threadgoode gives Idgie money to start a business so she can care for Ruth and Buddy Jr. Ruth and Idgie open the Whistle Stop Cafe, employing cook Sipsey (Cicely Tyson) and her son Big George (Stan Shaw), who makes a barbecue that quickly becomes popular with their patrons.Frank Bennett eventually returns to Whistle Stop in an attempt to kidnap Buddy Jr., but is thwarted by an unseen assailant. Frank goes missing and his truck is later found at the bottom of a nearby lake. Idgie is immediately a suspect, as she had publicly threatened violence against him for beating Ruth. She is arrested along with Big George for Frank's murder. The local sheriff offers to release her and pin the crime solely on Big George, but Idgie refuses to sacrifice her friend. During the subsequent trial, the local minister lies, providing Idgie and Big George with an alibi for the time of Frank's disappearance. Taking into account Frank's reputation for getting drunk, the judge rules his death an accident. Idgie and Big George are cleared of all charges.After the trial, Ruth develops cancer and dies. Following her death, the caf&eacute; closes. Over time, many Whistle Stop residents eventually move away, bringing Ninny to the end of her story, but not before the revelation of what really happened to Frank.And that's where I'll stop, because I'm no spoiler!This is an amazing Grandparents Day gift and a true masterpiece to cinema.I must have received the best copy off the shelf, P.S. ..therefore the DVD quality in my personal experience was phenomenal.",5,A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY COLLECTION,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,4114,"['Thank', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'Epic', 'classic', 'now', 'proudly', 'owned', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', '1991', 'comedy-drama', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'Whistle', 'Stop', 'Cafe', 'Fannie', 'Flagg', 'Directed', 'Jon', 'Avnet', 'written', 'Fannie', 'Flagg', 'Carol', 'Sobieski', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'story', 'Depression-era', 'friendship', 'two', 'women', 'Ruth', 'Idgie', '1980s', 'friendship', 'Evelyn', 'middle-aged', 'housewife', 'Ninny', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'knew', 'Ruth', 'Idgie', 'centerpiece', 'parallel', 'story', 'concerns', 'murder', 'Ruth', 'abusive', 'husband', 'accusations', 'follow.The', 'film', 'received', 'generally', 'positive', 'reception', 'film', 'critics', 'was', 'nominated', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'filmmakers', 'drew', 'criticism', 'reviewers', 'removing', 'lesbian', 'content', 'book', 'plot', 'film', 'won', 'GLAAD', 'Media', 'Award', 'best', 'lesbian', 'content', '.Evelyn', 'Couch', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'timid', 'unhappy', 'housewife', 'forties', 'meets', 'elderly', 'Ninny', 'Threadgoode', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'Birmingham', 'Alabama', 'nursing', 'home', 'Ninny', 'several', 'encounters', 'Evelyn', 'story', 'now-abandoned', 'town', 'Whistle', 'Stop', 'Alabama', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'there', 'film', 'subplot', 'concerns', 'Evelyn', 'dissatisfaction', 'marriage', 'life', 'growing', 'confidence', 'developing', 'friendship', 'Ninny', 'narrative', 'switches', 'several', 'times', 'Ninny', 'story', 'set', 'World', 'War', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Evelyn', 'life', '1980s', 'Birmingham.Ninny', 'story', 'tomboy', 'Imogene', 'Idgie', 'Threadgoode', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'youngest', 'Threadgoode', 'children', 'whom', 'Ninny', 'sister-in-law', 'Idgie', 'close', 'relationship', 'charming', 'older', 'brother', 'Buddy', 'Chris', ""O'Donnell"", 'cut', 'short', 'when', 'hit', 'train', 'killed', 'Devastated', 'Idgie', 'formal', 'society', 'much', 'childhood', 'adolescence', 'Buddy', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'straitlaced', 'Ruth', 'Jamison', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'intervenes', 'request', 'concerned', 'Threadgoode', 'family.Idgie', 'initially', 'Ruth', 'attempts', 'friendship', 'then', 'gradually', 'deep', 'attachment', 'develop', 'Ruth', 'Whistle', 'Stop', 'marry', 'Frank', 'Bennett', 'Nick', 'Searcy', 'Valdosta', 'Georgia', 'Idgie', 'upset', 'losing', 'friend', 'struggles', 'forget', 'time', 'Ruth', 'now', 'pregnant', 'suffering', 'physical', 'abuse', 'Frank', 'Against', 'Frank', 'wishes', 'Ruth', 'Whistle', 'Stop', 'Idgie', 'where', 'child', 'named', 'Buddy', 'Jr.', 'born', 'Papa', 'Threadgoode', 'Idgie', 'money', 'start', 'business', 'can', 'care', 'Ruth', 'Buddy', 'Jr.', 'Ruth', 'Idgie', 'open', 'Whistle', 'Stop', 'Cafe', 'employing', 'cook', 'Sipsey', 'Cicely', 'Tyson', 'son', 'Big', 'George', 'Stan', 'Shaw', 'who', 'barbecue', 'quickly', 'popular', 'patrons.Frank', 'Bennett', 'eventually', 'Whistle', 'Stop', 'attempt', 'kidnap', 'Buddy', 'Jr.', 'thwarted', 'unseen', 'assailant', 'Frank', 'missing', 'truck', 'later', 'found', 'bottom', 'nearby', 'lake', 'Idgie', 'immediately', 'suspect', 'had', 'publicly', 'threatened', 'violence', 'beating', 'Ruth', 'arrested', 'Big', 'George', 'Frank', 'murder', 'local', 'sheriff', 'offers', 'release', 'pin', 'crime', 'solely', 'Big', 'George', 'Idgie', 'sacrifice', 'friend', 'subsequent', 'trial', 'local', 'minister', 'lies', 'providing', 'Idgie', 'Big', 'George', 'alibi', 'time', 'Frank', 'disappearance', 'Taking', 'account', 'Frank', 'reputation', 'getting', 'drunk', 'judge', 'rules', 'death', 'accident', 'Idgie', 'Big', 'George', 'are', 'cleared', 'charges.After', 'trial', 'Ruth', 'cancer', 'dies', 'Following', 'death', 'caf', 'eacute', 'closes', 'time', 'many', 'Whistle', 'Stop', 'residents', 'eventually', 'move', 'away', 'bringing', 'Ninny', 'end', 'story', 'not', 'revelation', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Frank.And', 'where', ""'ll"", 'stop', ""'m"", 'spoiler', 'amazing', 'Grandparents', 'Day', 'gift', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'cinema.I', 'must', 'have', 'received', 'best', 'copy', 'shelf', 'P.S', '..therefore', 'DVD', 'quality', 'personal', 'experience', 'was', 'phenomenal']",N/A

And it took me a while to see the relationship between the two women that was more than just friends. I also was shocked by the barbequing of Frank Bennett, Ruth Jamison's Klu Kluxing, wife beating husband. I read the Kindle book after seeing the film version and there is little similarity. They left out most of the best parts. The book is 415 pages and so detailed. Fanny is a wonderful writer but somewhat sinister in this one. Most of the good humor was felt out of the film with some violence left in. The death of Idgie's brother Buddy at the very beginning, using a train, was so sad. It turned Idgie into a masculine woman so that she never married and ended up felling in love with Ruth, a family friend.At the end of the book Idgie is still alive, in her eighties, living in the woods with Julian, her oldest living brother selling honey out of an old store or so it seemed. In the book version Ninny Threadgoode died while Evelyn is at a fat farm  and she does NOT go home to live with Evelyn and Ed Couch. To go that far away from the original story is a real stretch and if I were Fanny Flagg, I would have never allowed that! The film made for a happy ending and we all love a happy endings, but it wasn't true. So much of the movie was not in the original book but Hollywood is famous for destroying so many wonderful books. It seems to be their mission in life to ruin really good books and turn them into money making enterprises which is just what they did here. A pretty good movie if you didn't read the book.

The movie has an intriguing beginning, great acting, and a positive message.Dumpy housewife Evelyn Couch befriends Ninny Threadgoode on her visit to see her husband's Aunt Vespa.  While waiting for her husband, Evelyn converses with Ninny and the two become friends.  Throughout three quarters of the movie, the audience is told of the life of Idgie Threadgoode and her frienship with Ruth Jamison.  Ruth is a victim of an unfortunate marriage.  After the death of her mother, Ruth decides to leave her husband.  She is also pregnant with their child.  After leaving her husband, Ruth and Idgie open the Whistle Top cafe that soon becomes famous for its Green Fried Tomato recipe and bar-b-que.A murder pulls the events in the story forward followed by the search for the killer and Idgie's blame for the victim's death.  We are also shown the change of Evelyn Couch from dumpy housewife to don't-push-me-around-I-love-my-feminie-organ power woman.  At times her new found feminity may seem overboard but it is not without a personal triumph that is shared by the viewer (the grocery store parking lot incident).My pet peeve with the movie is its feminist message, especially through Evelyn Couch's transformation.  Granted, I was most convinced by Idgie and Ninny's portrayl, but there is this evident lack of respect for men, namely Evelyn's husband.  Perhaps the man is incapable of change, but in this day and age, men have made progress and have learned to co-exist (if you will) with their female significant others.  There is power in being assertive and making up your own mind, granted, but not at the expense of making the jerk look even more like a jerk and somehow making him incapable of change.",3,"Great acting, skewed message",1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,1784,"['Nothing', 'do', 'Wednesday', 'night', 'watched', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomaotoes', 'TV', 'movie', 'intriguing', 'beginning', 'great', 'acting', 'positive', 'message.Dumpy', 'housewife', 'Evelyn', 'Couch', 'Ninny', 'Threadgoode', 'visit', 'see', 'husband', 'Aunt', 'Vespa', 'waiting', 'husband', 'Evelyn', 'Ninny', 'two', 'become', 'friends', 'three', 'quarters', 'movie', 'audience', 'told', 'life', 'Idgie', 'Threadgoode', 'frienship', 'Ruth', 'Jamison', 'Ruth', 'victim', 'unfortunate', 'marriage', 'death', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'leave', 'husband', 'also', 'pregnant', 'child', 'leaving', 'husband', 'Ruth', 'Idgie', 'open', 'Whistle', 'Top', 'cafe', 'soon', 'famous', 'Green', 'Fried', 'Tomato', 'recipe', 'bar-b-que.A', 'murder', 'events', 'story', 'forward', 'followed', 'search', 'killer', 'Idgie', 'blame', 'victim', 'death', 'are', 'also', 'shown', 'change', 'Evelyn', 'Couch', 'dumpy', 'housewife', ""don't-push-me-around-I-love-my-feminie-organ"", 'power', 'woman', 'times', 'new', 'found', 'feminity', 'may', 'seem', 'overboard', 'not', 'personal', 'triumph', 'shared', 'viewer', 'grocery', 'store', 'parking', 'lot', 'incident', 'pet', 'peeve', 'movie', 'feminist', 'message', 'especially', 'Evelyn', 'Couch', 'transformation', 'Granted', 'was', 'most', 'convinced', 'Idgie', 'Ninny', 'portrayl', 'evident', 'lack', 'respect', 'men', 'namely', 'Evelyn', 'husband', 'Perhaps', 'man', 'incapable', 'change', 'day', 'age', 'men', 'have', 'made', 'progress', 'have', 'learned', 'co-exist', 'will', 'female', 'significant', 'others', 'power', 'being', 'assertive', 'making', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'granted', 'not', 'expense', 'making', 'jerk', 'look', 'even', 'more', 'jerk', 'somehow', 'making', 'incapable', 'change']",N/A

It would make sense since she had photos of idgie and ruth, and knew every detail about their adventures and friendship. But at the beginning, Miss Thredgood said she married idgie's brother Cleo, and was practially adopted by the thredgood family. That contradicts actually being idgie. Or did she just say idgie was alive, so that she could keep her memory alive, because before she told Evylen to go to the grave, she said ""all these people will live, as long as you remember them"" Well anyway, I've watched Fried Green Tomatoes for years, and it's funny, and sad, and heart-warming.

This is the sort of film often disparagingly refered to as a woman's picture, but so full of charm, grace, intelligence and poignant performances that one could easily be a guy and cry by the end of the final fade out.Universal Studios has done an exceptional job on this DVD.  You not only get the extended director's cut of the film but a keen documentary and a host of other intelligent special features that, for once, do not satisfy simply superficial demands for ""made-up"" extras.The print used to remaster the film has been well preserved and is beautifully represented.  There is some minor pixelization, edge enhancement, shimmering details and faint (I mean faint) aliasing problems but nothing that will rob you from experiencing this movie with the greatest of emotional depth.  If you have never seen this movie, it is on my top ten list of American films I think every living person should be required to see.  Another is ""The Shawshank Redemption"".

314110,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,6302468027,Octavius,"[0, 0]","Jon Avnet's 1991 film on life and everlasting frienship. A very touching film with multiple themes explored through deep character studies.Kathy Bates stars as a wife in crisis who feels that she's everyone else's door mat. By accident, she becomes friends with an elderly lady (Jessica Tandy) who lives in a retirement home and receives little company. Kathy Bates becomes captivated by the old woman's stories of friends she knew a long time ago. After offering many visits to hear her stories, Bates becomes good friends with Tandy's character. Tandy's narratives change the scenes to the past to follow the lives of two women (Mary Stuary Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker) living in the South in the 20s and 30s. One of the friends is the reserved Southern Belle while the other is the fiercely independent tomboy. Because the women are both at odds with many of the customs and traditions of the South (segregation, marriage, etc.) they are soon faced with hostility. The story goes on to cover all of the trials and tribulations the women encountered in their lives and how such adversity made them stronger.Again, a very touching film on life and its challenges. The film explores how personal and social struggles can bring out the best and the worst in the human being.

Jon Avnet's debut as director is certainly admirable, as are the well received performances of Kathy Bates &amp; Jessica Tandy. Fannie Flagg's novel provided a perfect opportunity for some great female performances. The Oscar nominated screenplay of Ms. Flagg &amp; Carol Sobieski only lost the Oscar because it was up against another Woman-driven script, &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; (which won). How often will that happen again? The real driving forces in this film  are the performances of Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker (unappreciated, both, with a respectable body of work behind them)  Chris O'Donnell, just before  his remarkable performance in &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, made a big impression. It seems strange to me that I remember Lesbian overtones from the press about this film and, though, understandable, I don't know why friendship films like &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot; or &quot;Thelma&quot; or the original Oscar-winner &quot;Wings&quot; never got that buzz.

Actually it is two stories; the current story of a women in mid life crisis and the story of the 1930s restaurnt and the people involved in it. So what you get are flashbacks that actually make up half the movie. As the show progresses each story fuses together in many ways. This is also a classic good vs evil yarn in which good does triumph but not all the time. Like all good movies it will make you think a little more about life; past and the shape of the present.Now the negative stuff. Frankly i'm quite amazed that nobody seems to notice this or to have a problem with it. This is the ultimate politically correct movie. All PC issues are right there front and center. Feminism, race, lesbianism. Obviously that is at the core of the message. Despite all this nice textured story line is this rather simpleton, superfical message. White men are stupid and evil and one actually eats human flesh and likes it. All the women in the film are heroic as are the black men. When a young women dies it is a black women who stays by her side. No men in sight. The evil klan makes an appearence and the young women's husband beat her and had the klan steal the baby. Also at her side is her life long friend and business partner who has been romantically in love with her for a long time. White males are mean to blacks. White males beat and steal from women.

All the people in Fried Green Tomatoes played their parts with great enthusiasm and with heart. Staying close to the book by Fannie Flagg it focuses on Idgie and Ruth, as well as Evelyn and Ninny, showing how friendship blossoms and stays strong through out the years. The cast is sterling - No one could have played the part other than Jessica Tandy as Ninny, an elderly lady in a nursing home that brings her humor and stories to a sad candy-consumming middle age Evelyn Couch, played brilliantly by Kathy Bates. The two strike a friendship as Ninny relates the story of Idgie Threadgood (played by Mary Stuart Masterson) and her family as well as her unique friendship with Ruth Jamison (played by Mary Louise Parker). Cicely Tyson does an excellent job as Sipsey, a woman who is a cook at the cafe in Whistle Stop. There is romance, intrigue, murder, and suspense as well subtle and explicit humor. Having this movie brings parts that weren't even in the original movie or in the first video or dvd. I am glad I waited to get the extended version and plan on sharing it with MY best friend.

314138,A2PJUHR9LD9XKZ,6302468027,Skywalker,"[0, 0]","A beautifully made film, setting, music (the music in particular) and actors are marvellous and create a warm, inviting atmosphere that is agreeable to visit again and again. Unforgettable are most of all Mary Stuart Masterson in her masterly interpretation of the tomboy Idgie Threadgoode and Marie-Louise Parker as her sweet girl friend Ruth; the late friendship between Evelyn and Ninny (Virginia), beautifully played by Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy is also convincing and rounds up sensitively, but also with a few funny inserts, the rather uncommon subject ""female friendship"".One of the film's mistakes is in my opinion that when it was made in the early 90es the filmmakers obviously did not dare yet to depict the relationship between Idgie and Ruth as what it actually is, a love story between two women. Here it is ""only"" a close friendship, which sails around one of the story's main themes. In a similarly conservative way Emily's relationship to her husband is played down respectively given a more comical turn: in the film we do not learn that she is taking all of her ""marriage classes"" because her husband is being unfaithful.One of the major changes I really liked was the characterization of Sheriff Grady: though he is good-hearted and honest as in the book, he has way more character, which is a decisive advantage compared to how he was in the book. You gain the impression that he is the only man who has just as much backbone as the women he deals with, while the book is decidedly a ""female story"" where the men, good and kind as they may be, usually do not make the main decisions respectively do not carry the story on.Cleverly arranged is the film's ending, which gives the viewer the impression that the old story-telling woman from the retirement home is Idgie herself, and that she is now going to live with Evelyn; she did introduce herself to Evelyn as ""Ninny"", but the impression is emphasized by the fact that we never see young Ninny during the flashbacks to the past. This is not conform with the book, but it does make the film's ending somewhat more hopeful and less melancholy than in the book, although it is not quite understandable why Idgie should not have told Evelyn her real identity.And this leads to the third major criticism I have - the many important minor characters which are often superficially depicted and do not get enough room. Of course the film may have become too long and too complicated, but nevertheless it is regrettable that trying to shorten the story many beautiful details had to be sacrificed.Even if you love this film, I would recommend you to read Fannie Flagg's novel to round it up.",4,A beautiful film despite major alterations to the book,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,2659,"['beautifully', 'made', 'film', 'setting', 'music', 'music', 'particular', 'actors', 'are', 'marvellous', 'create', 'warm', 'inviting', 'atmosphere', 'agreeable', 'visit', 'again', 'again', 'Unforgettable', 'are', 'most', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'masterly', 'interpretation', 'tomboy', 'Idgie', 'Threadgoode', 'Marie-Louise', 'Parker', 'sweet', 'girl', 'friend', 'Ruth', 'late', 'friendship', 'Evelyn', 'Ninny', 'Virginia', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Jessica', 'Tandy', 'also', 'convincing', 'up', 'sensitively', 'also', 'few', 'funny', 'inserts', 'rather', 'uncommon', 'subject', 'female', 'friendship', '.One', 'film', 'mistakes', 'opinion', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'early', '90es', 'filmmakers', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'dare', 'yet', 'depict', 'relationship', 'Idgie', 'Ruth', 'what', 'actually', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'women', 'Here', 'only', 'close', 'friendship', 'one', 'story', 'main', 'themes', 'similarly', 'conservative', 'way', 'Emily', 'relationship', 'husband', 'played', 'down', 'respectively', 'given', 'more', 'comical', 'turn', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'learn', 'taking', 'marriage', 'classes', 'husband', 'being', 'unfaithful.One', 'major', 'changes', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'characterization', 'Sheriff', 'Grady', 'good-hearted', 'honest', 'book', 'way', 'more', 'character', 'decisive', 'advantage', 'compared', 'how', 'was', 'book', 'gain', 'impression', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'backbone', 'women', 'book', 'decidedly', 'female', 'story', 'where', 'men', 'good', 'kind', 'may', 'be', 'usually', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'main', 'decisions', 'respectively', 'do', 'not', 'carry', 'story', 'on.Cleverly', 'arranged', 'film', 'ending', 'viewer', 'impression', 'old', 'story-telling', 'woman', 'retirement', 'home', 'Idgie', 'now', 'going', 'live', 'Evelyn', 'did', 'introduce', 'Evelyn', 'Ninny', 'impression', 'emphasized', 'fact', 'never', 'see', 'young', 'Ninny', 'flashbacks', 'past', 'not', 'conform', 'book', 'make', 'film', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'more', 'hopeful', 'less', 'melancholy', 'book', 'not', 'quite', 'understandable', 'why', 'Idgie', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'told', 'Evelyn', 'real', 'identity.And', 'third', 'major', 'criticism', 'have', 'many', 'important', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'superficially', 'depicted', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'room', 'course', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'become', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'complicated', 'regrettable', 'trying', 'shorten', 'story', 'many', 'beautiful', 'details', 'had', 'be', 'sacrificed.Even', 'love', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'read', 'Fannie', 'Flagg', 'novel', 'round', 'up']",N/A

One in a nursing home, and one in the friendship retold by Cleo Threadgoode during those visits.  On the down side it was very feministic, to the point of portraying men in general of being evil ogres. Women would be up in arms about any similar one sided portrayal of women.

Bates stars as a woman who has reached middle age and is being taken for granted by her husband.

Parker and Masterson play women who eventually fall in love at a time when homosexuality wasn't accepted or permitted.
