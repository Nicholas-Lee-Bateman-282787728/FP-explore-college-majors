Inspired by the horrific true events that took place in Indiana suburbia. Similar to an American crime but way more gore and emphasis on the torture and depraved acts of a sick woman who should have never been able to look after any child. Unfortunately for Silvia lykens, she never stood a chance. It also was interesting to see how easily the other siblings and neighborhood children would join in on ""punishing"" the 16 year old girl.",5,True crime dripped in blood.,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,509,"['Wow', 'what', 'movie..', 'Not', 'everyone', 'Truth', 'always', 'worse', 'fiction', 'Inspired', 'horrific', 'true', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Indiana', 'suburbia', 'Similar', 'American', 'crime', 'way', 'more', 'gore', 'emphasis', 'torture', 'depraved', 'acts', 'sick', 'woman', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'look', 'child', 'Unfortunately', 'Silvia', 'lykens', 'never', 'stood', 'chance', 'also', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'easily', 'other', 'siblings', 'neighborhood', 'children', 'would', 'join', 'punishing', '16', 'year', 'old', 'girl']",N/A

Inspired by the true events of Sylvia Likens, I have never felt so ashamed to have watched a movie regarding this genra.  King quoted it was the most shocking thing he had seen since ""Henry"" however, I believe Henry is practically G rated compaired to this.  This movie takes you into the dark relms of child abuse, without pulling away from multiple rapes, burnings, cuttings, and beatings of a teenage girl. The writer/director used a shock factor that I believe was needed and the shock factor was showing society the not so sugar coated reality of child abuse.  I did not think the performance of the aunt was spectacular until the end when I saw her mood change from leaving the basement to speaking to the cops at her front door, as far as the rest of the characters are concerned they did wonderful jobs, especially the girl who portrayed the life of Sylvia.  So a note of advice, do not watch this if you are easily disturbed, keep away from children and the elderly, most of all don't watch on a first date.",5,"Coming from an extreme gore hound, I feel violated and dirty.",1210550400,"05 12, 2008",2008,1137,"['What', 'out', 'light', 'hearted', 'drama', 'such', 'Stand', 'Me', 'turn', 'Flowers', 'Attic', 'Hostel', 'Inspired', 'true', 'events', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'have', 'never', 'felt', 'so', 'ashamed', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'regarding', 'genra', 'King', 'quoted', 'was', 'most', 'shocking', 'thing', 'had', 'seen', 'Henry', 'however', 'believe', 'Henry', 'practically', 'G', 'rated', 'compaired', 'movie', 'dark', 'relms', 'child', 'abuse', 'pulling', 'away', 'multiple', 'rapes', 'burnings', 'cuttings', 'beatings', 'teenage', 'girl', 'writer/director', 'used', 'shock', 'factor', 'believe', 'was', 'needed', 'shock', 'factor', 'was', 'showing', 'society', 'not', 'so', 'sugar', 'coated', 'reality', 'child', 'abuse', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'performance', 'aunt', 'was', 'spectacular', 'end', 'when', 'saw', 'mood', 'change', 'leaving', 'basement', 'speaking', 'cops', 'front', 'door', 'as', 'far', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'concerned', 'did', 'wonderful', 'jobs', 'especially', 'girl', 'who', 'portrayed', 'life', 'Sylvia', 'note', 'advice', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'are', 'easily', 'disturbed', 'keep', 'away', 'children', 'elderly', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'first', 'date']",N/A
1107985,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B000WC38EQ,Allan M. Lees,"[0, 0]","It's difficult to make a movie about childhood and the teen years. When we're young, the world is a small and emotionally charged place in which mad things are taken for normal. It's a world of miniatures that seem huge and it's a claustrophobic place. All this is difficult to capture in a movie. Yet this movie succeeds brilliantly through a combination of outstanding camera work and deft direction and editing.Blanche Baker is superb as the small-scale Eichmann who vents her bitterness and frustration on the two girls in her care. She hits just the right note: neither underplaying nor overplaying her role. The ""look-the-other-way"" tendency of humanity was particularly in evidence in 50s American suburbia and that's also captured here with great subtlety yet force, in a way that reinforces the quiet insanity of ""Aunt Ruth"". Everything conspires to enable the abuser and disempower the abused.It's easy to understand why many people have difficulty in watching this movie. Unlike most of the schlock churned out by Hollywood, this has real emotional impact and it is about real-world events. The scene in which Aunt Ruth sadistically beats the helpless crippled child for whom she's supposed to be caring is authentically gut-wrenching in a way that no amount of fake-blood-Rambo-violence-stock-movie-effect can ever hope to approach. Everything here is with the volume turned down. It's the evil of banality, the evil of small but insidious things.One reviewer wrote that maybe some things shouldn't be the subject of movies but I disagree. If we don't acknowledge the evil we're all capable of, we won't try to prevent it from happening. As many scientific studies have shown, most people have the capacity for genuine evil within them. We all harbor the concentration camp guard or the exploiter within us. When society lacks the mechanisms to keep such behavior in check, it's all too easy for insigificant, insecure, embittered and inadequate individuals to become monsters. This is a movie about private hell and it's a salutary lesson for us all.",5,Difficult to Watch but Excellent,1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,2063,"['difficult', 'make', 'movie', 'childhood', 'teen', 'years', 'When', ""'re"", 'young', 'world', 'small', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'place', 'mad', 'things', 'are', 'taken', 'normal', 'world', 'miniatures', 'seem', 'huge', 'claustrophobic', 'place', 'difficult', 'capture', 'movie', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'combination', 'outstanding', 'camera', 'work', 'deft', 'direction', 'editing.Blanche', 'Baker', 'superb', 'small-scale', 'Eichmann', 'who', 'bitterness', 'frustration', 'two', 'girls', 'care', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'underplaying', 'overplaying', 'role', 'look-the-other-way', 'tendency', 'humanity', 'was', 'particularly', 'evidence', '50s', 'American', 'suburbia', 'also', 'captured', 'here', 'great', 'subtlety', 'yet', 'force', 'way', 'quiet', 'insanity', 'Aunt', 'Ruth', 'Everything', 'conspires', 'enable', 'abuser', 'disempower', 'abused.It', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'difficulty', 'watching', 'movie', 'most', 'schlock', 'churned', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'real', 'emotional', 'impact', 'real-world', 'events', 'scene', 'Aunt', 'Ruth', 'sadistically', 'helpless', 'crippled', 'child', 'whom', 'supposed', 'be', 'caring', 'authentically', 'gut-wrenching', 'way', 'amount', 'fake-blood-Rambo-violence-stock-movie-effect', 'can', 'ever', 'hope', 'approach', 'Everything', 'here', 'volume', 'turned', 'down', 'evil', 'banality', 'evil', 'small', 'insidious', 'things.One', 'reviewer', 'wrote', 'maybe', 'things', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'subject', 'movies', 'disagree', 'do', ""n't"", 'acknowledge', 'evil', ""'re"", 'capable', 'wo', ""n't"", 'try', 'prevent', 'happening', 'many', 'scientific', 'studies', 'have', 'shown', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'capacity', 'genuine', 'evil', 'harbor', 'concentration', 'guard', 'exploiter', 'When', 'society', 'mechanisms', 'keep', 'such', 'behavior', 'check', 'too', 'easy', 'insigificant', 'insecure', 'embittered', 'inadequate', 'individuals', 'become', 'monsters', 'movie', 'private', 'hell', 'salutary', 'lesson']",N/A

The story then Backtracks to the 1950's when he was a child.  Everything starts off normal... It looks like the perfect 50's town and a normal group of kids playing an innocent game.From here you're introduced to a bunch of characters including the 'Girl Next Door', along with her brothers and sisters. She is an orphan who is living in a household with her sister along with their disturbed mother and her kids...The boy ends up taking a liking to the girl next door and from there all goes downhill as you see what is really going on behind closed doors. The girl is being abused by the mother, the kid knows about it and he's powerless to stop it.  As the story progresses you can feel the tension slowly mounting as the abuse gets worse and worse..You see the slow progression of the abuse escalate as it goes from bad to shocking. The neighborhood kids and brothers of the orphaned girl are bonding and participating in this girls abuse but with the role model they have you have to wonder if they are a product of their environment or if they are as cold blooded as the mother. I'd also like to add that the woman who plays the mother is the scariest thing I've ever seen....During this film you're hoping the abuse will let up- It's relentless. By the end of the movie you are left wondering along with the victims how someone could possibly do those kinds of things to a human.All I can think of to describe this movie is it's like watching a train wreck. You feel as helpless as the victim and cant stop what's coming yet you wish you could.  It instills a sense of dread and realism that not many films can.

1107989,A20Y3T55MJBAEH,B000WC38EQ,"Anastasia Beaverhausen ""AB""","[4, 11]","Unlike An American Crime this isn't a faithful adaptation, but more kiddie snuff porn with an academic leftist feminist propaganda bent to it. I would argue that this is for perverts with an agenda, (not necessarily that of compassion). Esp. given how relentlessly this script tried to force all kinds of Hollywood political correctness upon this story:  For example they switched this to the 1950s when it took place in the '60s.  It's ironically, of course,  set in a clean peaceful luxurious suburb, which Hollywood always-nudge nudge wink wink-insists contains hidden evils.  In reality this story took place in utter squalor; the single mother who commited this crime lived in such desperate squalor that her brood had to take turns sharing three spoons, stole clothes off other peoples lines, and vegetables out of other people's gardens.This film endlessly tries to pound home the dangers of ""patriarchy"" when the reality was that this was a single mother doing and instigating all the abuse. (BTW women actually commit the majority of child abuse, not men.)  And in reality, you should know, that while this girl was sexually humiliated, starved and and physically tortured to death, she was not raped and her clitoris was not burned off.  The villain of this specific movie, who kind of reminded me of a campy Divine character, is given almost word for word speeches from Kate Millet's disingenuous feminist polemic on the real events. (Which makes you wonder who really hates women.)And while thank God Laws have been passed since to protect children, keep in mind that the real life situation that Sylvia Lykens suffered and was immolated in is actually closer to the foster family situations that the government forces children into after taking them away from their families.If out of human compassion you want to see the unimaginable ordeal of Sylvia Likens, watch An American Crime. (A film Which also screams for chivalry, personal responsibility and an abadonment of herd mentality-something so needed in the era of political correctness.) However, even An American Crime is not 100% faithful, because the reality of what happened to the actual victim is too horrible to be shown.  But Girl Next Door is some of the most evil exploitation. It does nothing to honor the real Likens.

Childhood is a period without conscience, without empathy, when the id still reigns supreme. In the film, Davy stands alone as the exception to the rule. He has some adult qualities insofar that he's more spiritually and emotionally developed than other children. He has acquired a measure of compassion. However, he's too fearful to take a stand. Rather, he rather naively resorts to trying to help Meg escape rather than go against peer pressure in a manner that is obvious. This film is perhaps the potent extract of the childhood id, and one of the more honest coming-of-age stories.

There is much more to this story than just child torture though.  It's also a period piece, a love story, a coming-of-age story.  There are heavy themes of authority, choices, morality, secrets.  Each scene is an essential patch woven into an absorbing tapestry.  It won't give you a warm feeling inside.The director Gregory Wilson does an amazing job working with these kids.  There are some devastating, adult situations that I'm pretty sure some of the young cast wasn't actually present for.  At least I hope not.  Additionally, I was impressed with how much of the horror occurs off screen, the implied brutality will leave scorching images in your mind.This film is pretty close to perfect, as far as disturbing cinema goes.  The only slight problem I had was how nearly all the kids seemed to immediately transform from childhood playmates to sadistic little psychopaths.  Hopefully no kids are this evil.  Their wicked, overbearing aunt manipulated them pretty easily.

There were only a couple of scenes where this was displayed and they were quick and hollow and for me unrealistic scenes. Imagine how much more potent the film would've been if they spent more time(another 30 minutes would've been perfect) on this subject...(how seemingly innocent children can get caught up in such evil without even realizing that what there doing is evil). They hardly dealt with any of the other neighborhood kids plites with there parents(especially the other girls). How do you skip over the heart of the matter?

Both the movie and book were loosely based on the infamous Gertrude Baniszewski murder of Sylvia Likens that took place in Indiana in the 1960's.If you watch this movie, you may be under the impression that it is over the top in terms of its horrific scenes.  However, if you read about the true life case, you'll see that the movie is in fact not as bad in certain instances than the actual brutality that took place.  In the true case, Baniszewski and her young accomplices actually made Likens eat her own feces and used a hot sewing needle to do the branding.  Amazingly enough, Baniszewski only spent 14 years in jail for the tragic crime before being paroled.As far as the movie goes, it is excellent.  The acting is superb: Blythe Auffarth does a superb job in the title role and Blanche Baker plays the diabolical murderess in outstanding fashion.  Viewers will definitely feel sorry for the victim and despise the monster who did her in due to the exemplary performances.  And, although the movie goes off the track of the Indiana case, it is an outstanding ally to Ketchum's fictionalized account in print.

I'll mention the acting, writing and directing and further get into my thoughts on the product. But for the first time I'm actually speechless. I really don't even know how to put this review together or where to even start. I've seen a lot of movies in my time, but I don't think a movie has ever made me feel the way The Girl Next Door did. As a fan of extreme cinema and exploitation flicks I've seen the most shocking of movies. But The Girl Next Door is probably the movie that most got to me. And while yes the movie has violence you don't see a lot of it, but knowing what is happening you don't have to see it.This movie isn't entertaining and I can't say I enjoyed it. It's kinda hard to enjoy a movie like this. But The Girl Next Door is simply brilliant. This is what filmmaking is all about. This movie will shock you to your core. Anybody with a heart will find this movie deeply disturbing. What makes it even worse is this is inspired by a true story and from what I hear the true story is even more horrific. What makes matters worse is that it's a child who goes through these terrible events. Not that it's ok if it's an adult, but there is something worse when these terrible things are done to a child.The Girl Next Door I have to say turned my stomach I actually felt sick watching the movie and I even got teary eyed, which is something that never happens to me. After the movie was over all I could do is stare at the screen with this terrible feeling. I was sort of numb and just well felt sick. This movie aims to disturb and it does big time. This movie will stay with you after you watch it.The screenplay was written by Daniel Farrands and Philip Nutman and it was very well written and gets the job done. They wrote one hell of a script and hopefully people take notice. I wasn't sure what to make of Farrands I've never been impressed with his writing, but this movie proves the talent he has.Director Gregory Wilson is a talent to watch for. His scenes are well paced and he made a movie to disturb the audience and he very much did that. Like I said this movie is probably the most bothered I have ever been. I felt sick and almost wanted to cry. At one point I almost shut it off. So for that I give Gregory Wilson a lot of credit. No film has ever made me feel like that.The performances are very strong and Blythe Auffarth as Meg Loughlin is an actress with one hell of a future ahead of her. She was simply brilliant and I cannot wait to see what the future has in store for her. What happens to her character is disgusting I'm not even gonna describe the scenes since they are so powerful words cannot do it justice. Even though the actress at the time was about 19, her character is only 13-years old. And what happens to her character should never ever happen to a child.Once the 40-mintue mark hits the movie becomes very disturbing and it never once lets up. The Girl Next Door is a brilliant piece of filmmaking and a movie you'll never forget. The Girl Next Door isn't really a horror flick it's more of a drama/thriller, but what happens here is more horrific than any horror movie I have ever seen so therefore I do see it as a horror movie.",5,This movie will shock you to your core.,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,3296,"['Normally', 'writing', 'review', 'quite', 'simple', 'discuss', 'what', 'liked', 'disliked', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'acting', 'writing', 'directing', 'further', 'get', 'thoughts', 'product', 'first', 'time', ""'m"", 'actually', 'speechless', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'put', 'review', 'together', 'where', 'even', 'start', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'movies', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'feel', 'way', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'did', 'fan', 'extreme', 'cinema', 'exploitation', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'shocking', 'movies', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'probably', 'movie', 'most', 'got', 'yes', 'movie', 'violence', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'lot', 'knowing', 'what', 'happening', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'it.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enjoyed', 'kinda', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'what', 'filmmaking', 'about', 'movie', 'will', 'shock', 'core', 'Anybody', 'heart', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'What', 'even', 'worse', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'what', 'hear', 'true', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'horrific', 'What', 'matters', 'worse', 'child', 'who', 'terrible', 'events', 'Not', 'ok', 'adult', 'something', 'worse', 'when', 'terrible', 'things', 'are', 'done', 'child.The', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'have', 'say', 'turned', 'stomach', 'actually', 'felt', 'sick', 'watching', 'movie', 'even', 'got', 'teary', 'eyed', 'something', 'never', 'movie', 'was', 'could', 'do', 'stare', 'screen', 'terrible', 'feeling', 'was', 'sort', 'numb', 'just', 'well', 'felt', 'sick', 'movie', 'disturb', 'big', 'time', 'movie', 'will', 'stay', 'watch', 'it.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Daniel', 'Farrands', 'Philip', 'Nutman', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'job', 'done', 'wrote', 'one', 'hell', 'script', 'hopefully', 'people', 'take', 'notice', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'Farrands', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'impressed', 'writing', 'movie', 'talent', 'has.Director', 'Gregory', 'Wilson', 'talent', 'watch', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'paced', 'made', 'movie', 'disturb', 'audience', 'very', 'much', 'did', 'said', 'movie', 'probably', 'most', 'bothered', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'felt', 'sick', 'almost', 'wanted', 'cry', 'one', 'point', 'almost', 'shut', 'off', 'So', 'give', 'Gregory', 'Wilson', 'lot', 'credit', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'feel', 'that.The', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'strong', 'Blythe', 'Auffarth', 'Meg', 'Loughlin', 'actress', 'one', 'hell', 'future', 'ahead', 'was', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'future', 'store', 'What', 'character', 'disgusting', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'gon', 'describe', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'powerful', 'words', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'Even', 'actress', 'time', 'was', 'about', '19', 'character', 'only', '13-years', 'old', 'what', 'character', 'should', 'never', 'ever', 'happen', 'child.Once', '40-mintue', 'mark', 'movie', 'very', 'disturbing', 'never', 'once', 'up', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', ""n't"", 'really', 'horror', 'flick', 'more', 'drama/thriller', 'what', 'here', 'more', 'horrific', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'so', 'therefore', 'do', 'see', 'horror', 'movie']",N/A

""The Girl Next Door"" claims variously to be ""based on a true story"", ""inspired by actual events"", etc.  It is, however, an adaptation of a novel and while both may well have been ""inspired"" by a 1965 Indiana child abuse case, the only thing I could find in common between the film and the actual case was that significant portions of both took place in a basement.Seen as a horror film, ""The Girl Next Door"" certainly delivers.  It is indeed horrifying--shockingly so.  The acting and direction are competent, and what appears to be a miniscule budget is extremely well-used.  So if you like your frights with some ""sick"" overtones, this might be for you.Viewed as a recounting of ""actual events"", however, this film fails miserably.  For reasons of their own, both novelist and screenwriters included essentially nothing from the case which inspired the story.  The time period is shifted to the 1950s, the location and basic situation are changed, and every one of the events is fictionalized.  Perhaps most disturbingly, while drawing inspiration from a real-life child abuse case, the writers found it necessary to invent utterly grotesque torments to which the victim at the center of the movie is subjected and from which the camera just barely turns away.  At that point, the film becomes an exercise in voyeurism, basically an exploitation film which, due to the age of the fictional victim and most of the other characters, has a decidedly unsavory feeling to it.  I felt dirty after watching this movie.  Not informed about a tragic and ugly historical event or about the horrors of child abuse, just used psychologically much as the film's victim was abused physically.If you have seen the infinitely superior ""An American Crime"" and considered this film as a possible alternate view of the real-life case, forget it.

It is at least loosely based upon a true story related in this book:House of Evil: The Indiana Torture Slaying (St. Martin's True Crime Library). This story is, of course, about the abuse and torture of a teenage girl at the hands of her own custodial aunt and cousins. It pulls no punches in what it shows, which, along with the torture scenes, includes some rather gratuitous adolescent nudity.The character of ""Auntie Ruth"" Chandler develops very effectively from what appears to be simply a bitter yet coarsely fun, tomboyish divorcee to something much darker. The various child characters of the ""innocent, carefree"" 1950s are especially great insofar as both acting and general characterization are concerned. There is also some very well-done foreshadowing and plot development in the children's various antics before the terror begins. While there are no ghosts, zombies, or vampires here, the human monsters are far more frightening than those in any supernatural horror film.There are a few big stretches; e.g., Wouldn't a 10-year-old boy get pretty drunk, and perhaps quite sick, after drinking two or three cans of beer, and wouldn't it eventually become obvious where he was getting it? Still, the stark realism of this film makes its more hard-to-buy qualities forgivable.As others have noted, THE GIRL NEXT DOOR requires a very strong stomach from its audience, but if you want to see something truly horrifying, I recommend it without reservation.Based upon a novel by Jack Ketchum,The Girl Next Door.

1108015,AOSQGCFCH4XCR,B000WC38EQ,E. Chen,"[2, 11]","I never write reviews, I'm a star clicker. I click a button and move on with my life. However after watching this movie I was compelled to. ""The Girl Next Door"" is a poor adaptation of a novel (based on a true crime) by Jack Ketchum and is an overall poorly made film. I don't want to judge the movie based on its on faithfulness to the book because its quite faithful, which is maybe its weakness. However many of the key elements that made the book great and in general are present in any successful horror/suspense film are lacking here. Those things are acting, atmosphere and tension.The dialogue, while true to the novel, falls flat and unnatural coming out the mouths of the actors, especially our key players Meg, Ruth and David. Meg, apart from the torture scenes, tries too hard to be a young teen in guise of the fact that she's really an adult woman. Because of that she lacks the precociousness and strength she had in the book, which also made her sympathetic. Ruth, who's supposed to be a domineering adult figure with violent outbursts, seems to have one dimension, a kind of laissez faire attitude. She's not frightening, she's not intimidating, everything she says is just sarcastic and snide, which is just annoying. Her character never changes and neither does David, our hero. From the start, David lacks the humanity and faults of a child. We never get the sense of why he doesn't just tell his parents what's going on the next door. We never get the feeling that he's feels powerless as a kid in an adult world. One huge difference between the book and the film that made David's character, is that in the book, David wanted to watch the torture in the beginning, he couldn't help himself which is why the Chandlers kept him around, cause he was one of them. In the film, from the start David is conflicted, and horrified by what he sees, he wants to get out immediately, which makes his relationship with the Chandlers awkward, because it leaves us wondering, why the hell do they keep this whiny kid around and not kick his ass already?The atmosphere and tension are nonexistent in the film. The lightening, for some reason is fairly high key in certain major scenes. Instead of adding to the horror, it kind of diminishes the power of it and makes it bland. The director also kept many of the violent scenes on a wide shot (I'm especially referring the the climax between Ruth and David), which takes you out of the film, when you realize how funny it looks, since he's pint sized. The story is so linear in attempts to stay faithful to the novel that it forgoes visual storyline and the element of surprise and by the end you're left wondering, ""Oh that's it?"".

All of them.  No movie has attacked my senses the way this movie has.  No movie has left me with a sickening feeling, a disgusted realization of the depths to which people are capable of sinking.  My jaw has never dropped so far, so fast, for so long.  My eyes cannot unsee what has been seen.  Absolutely unexpected Mike Tyson gut punch.Based upon the heart-breaking true story of Sylvia and Jenny Likens, and adapted from a novel by Jack Ketchum of the same name, the story follows sisters Meg (Blyth Auffarth) and Susan (Madeline Taylor) who, after their parents' death, are forced to live with their aunt Ruth (Blanche Baker).  After a brief period of normalcy, the relationship and situation turns into one of mental, verbal, physical, and sexual abuse that can buckle even the strongest person's knees.  Along with a mob mentality reminiscent of the children from Lord of the Flies, Ruth enlists her brainwashed children and their friends to do most of the despicable acts, eventually culminating in suspenseful tragedy.Blanche's portrayal is one of the most evil representations I have ever seen on film.  I admire her for the courage it took to accept this role, and I'll never look at her quite the same way again.  Auffarth is emotionally powerful as the defiant young soul who battles unimaginable torture to protect her younger sister, but eventually succumbs to overwhelming abuse.Director Gregory Wilson paints a picture - not unlike the infamous chainsaw scene in Scarface - that conveys the message without actually showing much.  The viewer knows what's happening to Meg, and that's more than enough to make anyone numb.  Beyond exploitation and the trivial torture - yes, trivial - of most other movies, this is so close to heart-wrenching reality, and lacking in either satisfactory retribution or reward, that it sickens me to my core.  Told through the burning lens of child abuse, this powerfully and sickeningly displays how the reality of warped parental influence and peer pressure can destroy childlike innocence.  It's perhaps the most effective horror movie I've ever seen; and considering some of the sick stuff I've seen and reviewed and laughed at (i.e. Funny Games, Hostel, Saw, etc.), that's saying a lot.Recommended ONE time hesitantly, to open eyes and witness a nearly flawless execution.",5,"Vile, Uncompromising Reality",1250121600,"08 13, 2009",2009,3010,"['watching', 'movie', 'first', 'thing', 'thought', 'was', 'What', 'movies', 'have', 'completely', 'shocked', 'surprised', 'left', 'wondering', 'WTF', 'just', 'happened', 'Here', 'first', 'ten', 'came', 'mind', 'Remember', 'ending', 'Sleepaway', 'Camp', 'Remember', 'sore', 'ankle', 'Misery', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Remember', 'Bobbit', 'bathroom', 'inspiration', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'Remember', 'bondage', 'revenge', 'Descent', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Remember', 'basement', 'scene', 'Sleepers', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Remember', 'bunny', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Remember', 'mom', 'just', 'chilling', 'original', 'Psycho', 'Remember', 'special', 'delivery', 'Se7en', 'Remember', 'surprise', 'Crying', 'Game', 'Remember', 'chest', 'buster', 'Alien', 'Child', 'play', 'movie', 'attacked', 'senses', 'way', 'movie', 'movie', 'left', 'sickening', 'feeling', 'disgusted', 'realization', 'depths', 'people', 'are', 'capable', 'sinking', 'jaw', 'never', 'dropped', 'so', 'far', 'fast', 'so', 'long', 'eyes', 'can', 'not', 'unsee', 'what', 'been', 'seen', 'Absolutely', 'unexpected', 'Mike', 'Tyson', 'gut', 'punch.Based', 'heart-breaking', 'true', 'story', 'Sylvia', 'Jenny', 'Likens', 'adapted', 'novel', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'same', 'name', 'story', 'sisters', 'Meg', 'Blyth', 'Auffarth', 'Susan', 'Madeline', 'Taylor', 'who', 'parents', 'death', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'aunt', 'Ruth', 'Blanche', 'Baker', 'brief', 'period', 'normalcy', 'relationship', 'situation', 'one', 'mental', 'verbal', 'physical', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'can', 'buckle', 'even', 'strongest', 'person', 'knees', 'mob', 'mentality', 'reminiscent', 'children', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'Ruth', 'brainwashed', 'children', 'friends', 'do', 'most', 'despicable', 'acts', 'eventually', 'culminating', 'suspenseful', 'tragedy.Blanche', 'portrayal', 'one', 'most', 'evil', 'representations', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'admire', 'courage', 'took', 'accept', 'role', ""'ll"", 'never', 'look', 'quite', 'same', 'way', 'again', 'Auffarth', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'defiant', 'young', 'soul', 'who', 'unimaginable', 'torture', 'protect', 'younger', 'sister', 'eventually', 'overwhelming', 'abuse.Director', 'Gregory', 'Wilson', 'picture', 'not', 'infamous', 'chainsaw', 'scene', 'Scarface', 'message', 'actually', 'showing', 'much', 'viewer', 'what', 'happening', 'Meg', 'more', 'enough', 'make', 'anyone', 'numb', 'Beyond', 'exploitation', 'trivial', 'torture', 'yes', 'trivial', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'so', 'close', 'heart-wrenching', 'reality', 'lacking', 'satisfactory', 'retribution', 'reward', 'core', 'Told', 'burning', 'lens', 'child', 'abuse', 'powerfully', 'sickeningly', 'displays', 'how', 'reality', 'warped', 'parental', 'influence', 'peer', 'pressure', 'can', 'destroy', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'perhaps', 'most', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'considering', 'sick', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviewed', 'laughed', 'i.e', 'Funny', 'Games', 'Hostel', 'Saw', 'etc', 'saying', 'lot.Recommended', 'ONE', 'time', 'hesitantly', 'open', 'eyes', 'witness', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'execution']",N/A

That's where the movie failed.  If you listen to the audio commentary with Jack Ketchum for the last few scenes, you will hear how disappointed/upset he was that the producers changed the ending without bothering to consult him or the script writers.

1108026,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000WC38EQ,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[14, 16]","Talk about being numb to your seat. Even though I've been warned I was still angered by it. I never cuss and fuss so much towards a film in my life. As  a parent I was totally appalled of all the actions that took place towards the sisters. Just because your (Ruth) life ended up bad doesn't mean you can take it upon a child. She's lucky I didn't bump into her in the streets but fortunately enough she got what she deserves.  In the beginning of this film, it revolves around David (played as an adult by William Atherton, the seminal 1980s), who after seeing a man hit by a car, recalls his youth and meeting Meg Loughlin (Blythe Auffarth), a 13 year old daughter of a gypsy left with her mother under the care of Ruth (Blanche Baker) and her sons. The young David (played by Daniel Manche) grows fond of his neighbors and Ruth, as she lets the boys drink beer, smoke cigarettes, and give them whatever they want. However, Ruth grows spiteful of Meg and her younger sister Susan (Madeline Taylor), crippled from polio. She starts with verbal abuse, and it soon turns into something more violent, as Ruth and her sons tie up Meg in the basement, and allow the neighborhood kids to torture her with cigarette burns, rape, and branding hot needles into her skin. David seems helpless, but slowly tries to find the courage to help her.The film starts out like any coming of age film, where David meets his new neighbors and the first act shows David's induction into Ruth's house. The second act begins the torture, and the third act is David's belated reaction to do something about it. It is successful on the filmmakers to have me react so strongly every time Ruth and her sons appeared on screen, because I know that's what they are going for. However, I felt that the process they used felt more exploitative than most. It shows in a scene before Meg's torture, where Ruth punishes Susan by dropping her pants and spanking her with a toilet bowl cleaner. We only see a view from below the bed, where Susan lies, but to see her braces fall to the ground as each slap is heard just felt sickening. The slow torture of Meg was very unpleasant to watch, and just went to a level so far it became exploitative. I know this really happened, but it didn't need to go to that level to show the point they needed to make. The director did state that the kids weren't there for explicit scenes but they were all there for Meg's first scene at the basement.Blythe Auffarth undeniably gave a brave performance as Meg, giving one of the most gut wrenching performances I've seen in a film. It is her suffering that sells the film and she succeeds admirably. Not every actress would do this role, and she should be applauded. Blanche Baker is such an evil (BEEP) as Ruth that she just made my stomach churn at her presence. Her sons were all played well as spoiled brats enjoying the evil acts they are doing, showing that children can prove to be as cruel as adults. These kids make Stewie from FAMILY GUY look like Opie Taylor. William Atherton is good as the adult David, but his scenes feel out of place and don't really provide any resolution. I've always liked Atherton as an actor, and I wish he had more to do. Some of the reviewers here along with my friends at Amazon had stated that ""The Girl Next Door"" is the most shocking for 07' and probably for the decade which I too agree upon. It's well directed, brilliantly acted (by some), and well written, but overall it's a film not made for the right reasons, and made to exploit your anger at the shocking elements of the film rather than bring this harrowing subject matter to the attention it deserves.

And then they all just go back to their normal lives. That was the creepiest part for me. The book has some literary value because it poses more questions than it answers. It's told in flashback by one of the neighbor boys. He didn't participate, but he witnessed the whole thing and did nothing to stop it. It is, in effect, a morality play.In this version (spoiler alert) the girl is barely pubescent, the boys are all children.

1108029,A3F9VH8916IA40,B000WC38EQ,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[10, 10]","WARNING, contains spoilers.Who is worse; the abuser who uses their position of power to torture and maim innocent people, or the person who sits idly by and allows the abuse to continue?How can I possibly review a movie like The Girl Next Door? I've been sitting in front of my computer screen for the last thirty minutes, knowing that I have to write something about this film but unable to do so. How can I write about the shocking nature of this film, about the brutality of human nature, the sickening imagery of a young and innocent girl forced to suffer and die to appease the demons of an insane woman? I know not the words needed to describe this film, but I will do my best none the less.Let in 1958 in suburban America, The Girl Next Door tells the story of two newly orphaned girls, Meig and Susan (who is afflicted with polio and uses leg braces to walk) who are sent to live with their Aunt Ruth after their parents are killed in an accident. David, a young boy who lives in the house next door, takes an immediate liking to her and is thrilled to learn that he'll be able to see her every day. If one is unfamiliar with the themes of this film when they start watching it, you might mistake it at first for something along the lines ofMy Dog Skip, a coming of age story set in the 50's about a boy and his friends discovering all life has to offer. The contrast between the opening ten to twenty minutes and the rest of the film is probably the most powerful aspect of the film. The children go from stealing dirty magazines from their parents and thinking fondly about what it might be like to see a real woman, the next they are torturing and raping a young girl who has done nothing to deserve their hatred and scorn.From the very beginning it is clear that Aunt Ruth has a strange dislike for these two girls. It begins simple enough with Ruth verbally abusing Meig and her sister for being too ""lady like"" and calling her a whore for making an oil painting for David, but quickly evolves into something far more sinister. David, as a close friend to Ruth's sons, has ample access to the house and witnesses first hand the brutality of Ruth when she hangs Meig by her arms from the ceiling and leaves her there to suffer all night.There are many themes that are worth looking at in this film. One is the sense of helplessness that David feels when all the adults he knows have either turned a blind eye to the abuse, want only to mind their own business, or are active participants of the torture. David seems to be the only person in the film that knows exactly what is happening and knows it's wrong, and yet does nothing to stop it. I do not want to excuse his actions at all; after all how long can someone ignore the actions of evil without turning into a monster themselves? But it isn't hard to understand why he allowed the abuse to continue; in his mind there was nothing he could have done. For children, especially those of his age (thirteen) adults represent authority, to be respected and obeyed. But even when Ruth's actions become too much for him to ignore, his parents either ignore him or tell him to mind his own business, and the police don't take his warning seriously. Peer pressure also is a major factor in how David decides to act. His best friends not only know about what is going on, but enthusiastically take part in it as well. There are few things more disturbing then a group of young children, ages eight to fourteen, boys and girls, attentively watching the oldest amongst them rape and cut a defenseless girl while sipping on a bottle of root beer. Even the youngest amongst them would like nothing more then to cut Meig with a knife to mark her as the ""whore"" Ruth believes she is. These children are David's best friends, kids he's known forever and grew up with. How can he turn on them?But as I said before, I don't want to excuse David's actions. If fact many times I found myself pleading with David to do something, anything, to make it stop. ""You know what's right David"" I'd find myself saying, ""you have to do something, and you know it."" Regardless of the peer pressure, regardless of his authority figures refusal to intervene, David is still the only person in the film with a sense of right wrong; it is his responsibility to do something.This is not a film for everyone. Although most of the abuse is done off camera and is implied rather then shown, the graphic nature of this film is truly horrifying. I could barely finish this film, and I normally have a very strong stomach. Evil is hard to confront, most people would rather turn their backs and pretend it doesn't exist, so when it is presented in such clear and unmistakable terms, such as in this film, its devastating to its viewers. The Girl Next Door is not a snuff film; it is a dark and unforgiving look into the dark side of American suburbia.

Although I do have the book, I have not read through it at the time of the review, so I will keep my review restricted to what the movie has, as I have not read the book.The Girl Next Door is a story about a girl named Meg. Meg has a hard past, but doesn't reveal much of it to David, mostly due to her insecurity and the reason why David asks, because she has a scar on her arm.Meg's just recently moved in with her sister to live with her aunt, Ruth.Everybody knows Ruth as a good woman...Of course, we already know from previous horror movies that evil can hide behind a beautiful woman or a good personality, and this is just what happens with Ruth. Behind a good-natured exterior lies a manic woman who's soul purpose is to make Meg's life a living hell.Although David witnesses terrible acts of abuse to the younger sister, Jenny, and ultimately what happens to Meg, he doesn't do anything. This is one of the main flaws of the movie. This is a kind of flaw that's an obvious plot hole. It makes the viewer go, `Why?' I already stated that I wouldn't address the book within this review, so I won't go into the mechanics of the book/movie might tie in and thread the loose plot holes together.In all, The Girl Next Door is a movie that is terrifying and at the same time, thought-provoking. All movies based off of true stories--and even in fictional tales--always make us ponder the reasons behind a person's violence or murderous intentions.

The fact that it is based on a true story makes it that much more horrific (the true story is incredible-this little girl suffered the tortures of the damned enough for ten lifetimes)! Meg (the ""girl"" of the title)and her younger sister are orphaned, and placed with ""Aunt Ruth"". Ruth already has a brood she somewhat cares for. For some unknown reason, Ruth takes exception to Meg (maybe jealousy?) and becomes the ringleader in torturing Meg for nothing more than her own depraved pleasure. One boy, David, sees the going's on, and increasingly becomes concerned for Meg. He is in no real position to do anything, but does attempt to call the police, but Ruth is a master at manipulation, herself, and placates the cop at her door.The tortures become more and more painful in nature, leaving Meg with not only mental scars, but physical ones as well. In the end, Meg is saved, but a little too late.I have read the real story behind ""The Girl Next Door"", and was almost brought to tears, alternating with anger at the human animals who perpetrated the crime. The girl was shown no mercy during the time she was held and tortured, and the majority of kids who participated were never punished! Even the mother, through legal wrangling, got life rather than the death penalty (another horrendous miscarriage of justice).I found this film to be ""Watered down Kool Aid"" compared to the true events it was based on, but an unnerving film, nonetheless.

1108037,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B000WC38EQ,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","It seems that a large number of movie goers are fans of the horror genre. Theatres fill when the exploits of Michael Meyers, Leatherface or Jason Vorhees arrive. These movies are all known as horror films, but in fact they offer more fantasy than actual horror. The same can not be said of JACK KETCHUM'S THE GIRL NEXT DOOR.Based on the novel by Ketchum which in turn was based on an actual occurrence, the film is at times disturbing, sentimental and truly horrifying. No monster that arrives infused by lightning or of indestructible strength, this one shows us a monster that could actually live in the house across the street.When their parents are killed in a car wreck, young Meg (Blythe Auffarth) and Susan (Madeline Taylor) are sent to live with their aunt Ruth (Blanche Baker). In the same house are Ruth's sons.Ruth is not your typical housewife. Abandoned years before by the boy's father, her home is one where all the boys and their friends meet to drink beer and learn about life. Next door neighbor David (Daniel Manche) is a frequent visitor. He is also the first of the gang to meet Meg while catching crawfish at the local creek.David immediately takes a liking to Meg and the two become friends. But as the story progresses, we find out that Aunt Ruth is not the nice lady she at first appears to be. David finds this hard to believe at first, but the more he sees, the more he realizes how truly evil she is.As far as Ruth is concerned, she has done nothing wrong. Even after she has her boys hang Meg from the rafters in the cellar and proceed to torture her and more. In her eyes, the eyes of someone insane, she is merely trying to teach the girl a lesson. The truth is none of the boys, Meg or David will walk away from this unscarred.The movie does not shy away from the disturbing ideas presented. But unlike what some are calling torture porn (like HOSTEL and the SAW films), this movie finds a way to present what is going on without gratuitously satisfying the voyeuristic filmgoer. Those people will be disappointed. But people who appreciate horror films or controversial films will not.This movie is not for all tastes. It is definitely not a holiday attraction. But for the more discerning viewer, those who appreciate the drama, the story and the real life horror that can be found anywhere, you may want to give this one a watch. Not for the squeamish or for children in any way.Perhaps if we were made more aware of the real life horrors that are out there, we might have a chance of preventing them. Even though it takes place in 1958, this film might make one pause to take a look around and find the monsters that lurk next door.",4,HORROR IS REAL,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,2668,"['large', 'number', 'movie', 'goers', 'are', 'fans', 'horror', 'genre', 'Theatres', 'fill', 'when', 'exploits', 'Michael', 'Meyers', 'Leatherface', 'Jason', 'Vorhees', 'arrive', 'movies', 'are', 'known', 'horror', 'films', 'fact', 'offer', 'more', 'fantasy', 'actual', 'horror', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'JACK', 'KETCHUM', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'NEXT', 'DOOR.Based', 'novel', 'Ketchum', 'turn', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'occurrence', 'film', 'times', 'disturbing', 'sentimental', 'truly', 'horrifying', 'monster', 'infused', 'lightning', 'indestructible', 'strength', 'one', 'monster', 'could', 'actually', 'live', 'house', 'street.When', 'parents', 'are', 'killed', 'car', 'wreck', 'young', 'Meg', 'Blythe', 'Auffarth', 'Susan', 'Madeline', 'Taylor', 'are', 'sent', 'live', 'aunt', 'Ruth', 'Blanche', 'Baker', 'same', 'house', 'are', 'Ruth', 'sons.Ruth', 'not', 'typical', 'housewife', 'Abandoned', 'years', 'boy', 'father', 'home', 'one', 'where', 'boys', 'friends', 'meet', 'drink', 'beer', 'learn', 'life', 'Next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'David', 'Daniel', 'Manche', 'frequent', 'visitor', 'also', 'first', 'gang', 'meet', 'Meg', 'catching', 'crawfish', 'local', 'creek.David', 'immediately', 'liking', 'Meg', 'two', 'become', 'friends', 'story', 'find', 'out', 'Aunt', 'Ruth', 'not', 'nice', 'lady', 'first', 'be', 'David', 'hard', 'believe', 'first', 'more', 'more', 'how', 'truly', 'evil', 'far', 'Ruth', 'concerned', 'done', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Even', 'boys', 'hang', 'Meg', 'rafters', 'cellar', 'proceed', 'torture', 'more', 'eyes', 'eyes', 'someone', 'insane', 'merely', 'trying', 'teach', 'girl', 'lesson', 'truth', 'none', 'boys', 'Meg', 'David', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'unscarred.The', 'movie', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'disturbing', 'ideas', 'presented', 'what', 'are', 'calling', 'torture', 'porn', 'HOSTEL', 'SAW', 'films', 'movie', 'way', 'present', 'what', 'going', 'gratuitously', 'satisfying', 'voyeuristic', 'filmgoer', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'horror', 'films', 'controversial', 'films', 'will', 'not.This', 'movie', 'not', 'tastes', 'definitely', 'not', 'holiday', 'attraction', 'more', 'discerning', 'viewer', 'who', 'appreciate', 'drama', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'horror', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'may', 'want', 'give', 'one', 'watch', 'Not', 'squeamish', 'children', 'way.Perhaps', 'were', 'made', 'more', 'aware', 'real', 'life', 'horrors', 'are', 'there', 'might', 'have', 'chance', 'preventing', 'Even', 'place', '1958', 'film', 'might', 'make', 'one', 'pause', 'take', 'look', 'find', 'monsters', 'lurk', 'next', 'door']",N/A

1108039,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B000WC38EQ,maskedgamer,"[3, 3]","There's plenty of reviews out there that break down the story of the Girl Next Door but I honestly don't think this movie gets the true credit it deserves.The Girl Next Door is not so much a movie made to entertain but a movie made to educate. Watching this movie makes you really wonder just what goes on out there in the world, and why do we let these things happen. The movie is based about a boy trying to do everything that he can to save a girl be befriended but he doesn't have the power to do so (he's only a kid). He tries to help the girl the best way he can (by doing things a boy his age would do). When he realizes that he honestly doesn't have the strength to help this girl no matter how bad he want's to he realizes the best thing he can do for her is comfort her (or so he tries). When the situation becomes to terrible the boy himself realizes that even his own safety isn't important has to save this girl somehow. He tries but again fails and finds himself worse of than he was before. It's only when he's walking in the same shoes as the girl that he really takes action and finally fights back... but still... it wasn't enough to save her.The story sends a great message to people that watch it. The true meaning of it can be caught at the end by the last sentences spoken by the grown version of David. When he criticizes himself for how he failed but ask himself what did she teach him. The girl next door taught him to take action up against atrocity.A simple concept that as cheesy as it sounds would make the world a much different place than it is. Most people don't want to go out their way to save or help someone....or look the other way when a crime is happening right in front of their face. The best example is shown at the beginning of the movie where the homeless man gets hit by a car and everyone is just standing there watching him...but David is the only one who realizes what's going on and does something to help the man.The real irony is that this also appears to happen in a busy city full of people and not a single person tries to help but David who has learned from his experience with the girl next door. There was real symbolism in that scene. It's true that people in the city and honestly those outside of it don't like to get involved...and when they choose to do that nothing ever happens and the cycle keeps continuing. It's only when people choose to get involved that the cycle is broken. Meaning it's the ""last thing they do"" that counts because it's that last thing that makes that much of a difference.The real shock of this movie that it's so disturbing to watch that you want it to just be a movie. You want to take it out your player put it in your dvd case and sit it back on the shelf and move on... but you can't. This movie isn't just a movie it's based on a true event. The most disturbing part about the movie and real life is that there never was a David to comfort the real girl that suffered and died. The real torture that the actual victim went through aside from a few scenes was actually much more cruel. It's not so easy to dispel the movie knowing that someone actually went through this and it was much worse because there wasn't anyone there to save them and they died alone.I really enjoyed watching this film for all the reasons I mentioned above. I knew of the case before the movie and even then it stuck with me. I could understand what Jack Ketchum was thinking when he made this story. There are lost of other cases out there he could have used but this case is very special. This case of Sylvia Likens is enough to bring any rational person to fury. It's about an innocent girl who was abused and tortured to death. You can only imagine how helpless she felt and was. It's one of those stories you hear that makes you yell out ""Why wasn't anyone there to stop this!""...and I honestly think that's how Jack Ketchum felt too when he learned about Sylvia.Overall this is an extremely great movie. Watch it and learn from it, and hopefully take something with you from it. You can admire the girl next door because she cared for her sister so much she would sacrifice her own well being, and you can also admire the film because it teaches you ""to do something"" and not just be another person that ""watches"" and does nothing.",5,Powerful film that sends a great message!,1282176000,"08 19, 2010",2010,4308,"['plenty', 'reviews', 'there', 'break', 'down', 'story', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'true', 'credit', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'made', 'entertain', 'movie', 'made', 'educate', 'Watching', 'movie', 'really', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'world', 'why', 'do', 'let', 'things', 'happen', 'movie', 'based', 'boy', 'trying', 'do', 'everything', 'can', 'save', 'girl', 'be', 'befriended', ""n't"", 'have', 'power', 'do', 'so', 'only', 'kid', 'help', 'girl', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'doing', 'things', 'boy', 'age', 'would', 'do', 'When', 'honestly', ""n't"", 'have', 'strength', 'help', 'girl', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'want', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'do', 'comfort', 'so', 'When', 'situation', 'terrible', 'boy', 'even', 'own', 'safety', ""n't"", 'important', 'save', 'girl', 'somehow', 'again', 'fails', 'worse', 'was', 'before', 'only', 'when', 'walking', 'same', 'shoes', 'girl', 'really', 'action', 'finally', 'fights', 'back', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'save', 'her.The', 'story', 'great', 'message', 'people', 'watch', 'true', 'meaning', 'can', 'be', 'caught', 'end', 'last', 'sentences', 'spoken', 'grown', 'version', 'David', 'When', 'how', 'failed', 'ask', 'what', 'did', 'teach', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'taught', 'take', 'action', 'up', 'atrocity.A', 'simple', 'concept', 'as', 'cheesy', 'would', 'make', 'world', 'much', 'different', 'place', 'Most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'out', 'way', 'save', 'help', 'someone', '.or', 'look', 'other', 'way', 'when', 'crime', 'happening', 'right', 'front', 'face', 'best', 'example', 'shown', 'beginning', 'movie', 'where', 'homeless', 'man', 'hit', 'car', 'everyone', 'just', 'standing', 'there', 'watching', 'David', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'what', 'going', 'something', 'help', 'man.The', 'real', 'irony', 'also', 'happen', 'busy', 'city', 'full', 'people', 'not', 'single', 'person', 'tries', 'help', 'David', 'who', 'learned', 'experience', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'was', 'real', 'symbolism', 'scene', 'true', 'people', 'city', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'get', 'involved', 'when', 'choose', 'do', 'nothing', 'ever', 'cycle', 'continuing', 'only', 'when', 'people', 'choose', 'get', 'involved', 'cycle', 'broken', 'Meaning', 'last', 'thing', 'do', 'last', 'thing', 'much', 'difference.The', 'real', 'shock', 'movie', 'so', 'disturbing', 'watch', 'want', 'just', 'be', 'movie', 'want', 'take', 'out', 'player', 'put', 'dvd', 'case', 'sit', 'back', 'shelf', 'move', 'ca', ""n't"", 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'event', 'most', 'disturbing', 'part', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'never', 'was', 'David', 'comfort', 'real', 'girl', 'suffered', 'died', 'real', 'torture', 'actual', 'victim', 'went', 'aside', 'few', 'scenes', 'was', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'cruel', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'dispel', 'movie', 'knowing', 'someone', 'actually', 'went', 'was', 'much', 'worse', 'was', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'there', 'save', 'died', 'alone.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'reasons', 'mentioned', 'knew', 'case', 'movie', 'even', 'then', 'stuck', 'could', 'understand', 'what', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'made', 'story', 'are', 'lost', 'other', 'cases', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'case', 'very', 'special', 'case', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'enough', 'bring', 'rational', 'person', 'fury', 'innocent', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'abused', 'tortured', 'death', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'helpless', 'felt', 'was', 'one', 'stories', 'hear', 'yell', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'there', 'stop', 'honestly', 'think', 'how', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'felt', 'too', 'when', 'learned', 'about', 'Sylvia.Overall', 'extremely', 'great', 'movie', 'Watch', 'learn', 'hopefully', 'take', 'something', 'can', 'admire', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'cared', 'sister', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'well', 'being', 'can', 'also', 'admire', 'film', 'do', 'something', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'person', 'watches', 'nothing']",N/A

I was really utterly wrong and taken by surprise with this one.  First of all, I am a thriller fan, and I was thinking along those lines that this movie would be a good thriller.  Well, to be honest its not really a thriller at least not what most people would understand under that genre.  Rather its a kind of thriller with a lot of horror elements in it, that's really the best way to explain it.So you might ask why was this so shocking and disturbing.  Simply, because it all seemed so real. Of course, one could say, that only makes sense when the movie has been advertised as based on true events.  Well, I can only hope that it wasen't based on such true event, because this is really horrific, something that no person should have to endure.  I don't want to give away the story, but suffice it to say, that this movie appears to be of the normal thriller type, until the girl stays over with a friend at another house were they are with other so called friends.  From here on the story starts getting really eerie and scary, since the mother of the other boys hates this girl, and has her tied up by her sons. Well, I won't get into what follows, but believe me anyone watching it will be affected by those gruesome scenes.  It is, mind you, not a horror film, since it dosen't employ any explicit graphic violence, but the things that transpire are scary enough to leave their mark on everyone.After this movie was over, I just couldn't seem to get it out of my head.  I really don't know if that is a good thing or not.  But some times I feel that it isen't something good or wholesome.  Being left with the impression that this DVD inevitably leaves you with, makes you wonder whether such movies should really be shown at all.  Even though the makers can easily claim that there is no real explicit graphic violence shown, but its really not that which scares you, its the actual idea of the torture, that makes this so morbid, especially since it is claimed that this really happend.So, better think twice before watching this one, because there is virtually no way that you won't be affect by it, its just to intense and disturbing for that.",4,"Shocking, and very disturbing !",1201651200,"01 30, 2008",2008,2319,"['When', 'movies', 'have', 'certainly', 'seen', 'fair', 'share', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'seen', 'past', 'was', 'really', 'utterly', 'wrong', 'taken', 'surprise', 'one', 'First', 'am', 'thriller', 'fan', 'was', 'thinking', 'along', 'lines', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'thriller', 'Well', 'be', 'honest', 'not', 'really', 'thriller', 'least', 'not', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'understand', 'genre', 'kind', 'thriller', 'lot', 'horror', 'elements', 'really', 'best', 'way', 'explain', 'it.So', 'might', 'ask', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'Simply', 'seemed', 'so', 'real', 'course', 'one', 'could', 'say', 'only', 'sense', 'when', 'movie', 'been', 'advertised', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'Well', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'wase', ""n't"", 'based', 'such', 'true', 'event', 'really', 'horrific', 'something', 'person', 'should', 'have', 'endure', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'story', 'say', 'movie', 'be', 'normal', 'thriller', 'type', 'girl', 'friend', 'house', 'were', 'are', 'other', 'so', 'called', 'friends', 'here', 'story', 'getting', 'really', 'eerie', 'scary', 'mother', 'other', 'boys', 'hates', 'girl', 'tied', 'up', 'sons', 'Well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'believe', 'anyone', 'watching', 'will', 'be', 'affected', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'mind', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'dose', ""n't"", 'employ', 'explicit', 'graphic', 'violence', 'things', 'transpire', 'are', 'scary', 'enough', 'leave', 'mark', 'everyone.After', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'head', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'good', 'thing', 'not', 'times', 'feel', 'ise', ""n't"", 'something', 'good', 'wholesome', 'Being', 'left', 'impression', 'DVD', 'inevitably', 'wonder', 'such', 'movies', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'shown', 'Even', 'makers', 'can', 'easily', 'claim', 'real', 'explicit', 'graphic', 'violence', 'shown', 'really', 'not', 'actual', 'idea', 'torture', 'so', 'morbid', 'especially', 'claimed', 'really', 'happend.So', 'better', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'watching', 'one', 'virtually', 'way', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'affect', 'just', 'intense', 'disturbing']",N/A

Wilson based on a true incident helmed ""the most horrific crime commited against one single person"" and Stephen King call's this movie ""The first authentically shocking American film since Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer"", and I actually agree with that statement all the way. It's a very hard-to-watch disturbing film with high production values, very sad, but very well made. I would actually think of it more as a disturbing drama flick than an actual horror film though.The true story took place in the 60's when a woman Gertrude Baniszewski offered to shelter 2 sisters Sylvia and Jenny Liken's while their parent's traveled with the carnival. Gertrude automatically took a disliking to one of the sister's Sylvia. She then manipulaed the neighborhood children (as well as her own) into punishing and torturing Sylvia in some of the most horrific way's imaginable. This is a true and horrific crime that more people should be aware of, even though this film can be hard to sit through I think it is good the story is finally being told.As close to the original story The Girl Next Door is I think it would have been more believable to follow the true event's a little more closely. The most interesting aspect I think the filmaker's left out of the film was how in real life people were told of the horrific crime's but nothing was done to help Sylvia, I think would have been an extremely intersting element to add to the movie. Also in the real story Gertrude was a truly mentally unstable woman who had a lot of her own mental and sexual issue's, but the movie does not touch upon the real mental state of Gertrude Baniszewski, but instead make's the antagonist ""Aunt Ruth"" seem fully aware of all her horrible action's and somewhat mentally stable. I think it would have been more interesting and beleivable to show just how mentally deranged this person really was. In real life she manipulated the neighberhood kid's into believing that Sylvia was bad person and she needed to be punished, but there is no manipulation in the movie, which make's the kid's action's seem like there was no reason other than pure cold heartedness. Also in the real story all of the event's (torture) took place over a couple of month's, and in the movie it make's the torture like it is a scheduled (daily) event, opposed to what was really ""punishment"" in the antagonists' eye's.Other than those minor complaint's Girl Next Door is an extremely horrific,depressing and well made film without using extreme violence or gore, but still make's you feel like the sicko that you are for watching it, just how I like it.

1108060,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000WC38EQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","The Girl Next Door (Gregory Wilson, 2007)I really, really wanted to like this movie. The Jack Ketchum novel upon which it's based is one of my favorite books, the screenplay was written by Phil Nutman, and they got themselves a good stable of actors to do the deed. So why is it ultimately as unsatisfying as it is?If you've been living in a cave since the late fifties, The Girl Next Door is based on the case known as the Indiana Torture Slaying, often considered the most horrific crime to have taken place in the state of Indiana; two girls, Sylvia and Jenny Fay Likens, had been sent to live with their aunt, Gertrude Baniszewski. While some of the details are cloudy, the end result was the gruesome death of Sylvia Likens after almost three months of sustained, increasingly brutal torture brought on, it seems, by a combination of the Likens' support payments not showing up on time and Baniszewski's deteriorating mental state, which somehow seems to have infected not only her sons, but a number of other children in the neighborhood as well.Ketchum's novel, and thus Wilson's film, takes the point of view of one of those neighbors, Davey Moran (Daniel Manche, currently on As the World Turns, who meets Sylvia's doppleganger for the purposes of the film, Meg Loughlin (Keeping the Faith's Blythe Auffarth), just after she moves in next door. The crazy aunt here is named Ruth Chandler (Blanche Baker of Sixteen Candles) and the disabled sister Susan (Madeline Taylor), but the story is the same-- Chandler snaps, and Meg becomes the object of her rage, while Chandler manipulates the neighborhood kids into complicity with her actions (at times, the kids mete out the torture themselves).There can be no denying the movie is exceptionally effective on a number of levels. It works almost entirely on suggestion and innuendo; we rarely see any of the things that happen here, thanks to creative camera angles and the like, but that makes it no less easy for us to identify with Meg Loughlin, as much as we can, anyway. Where it falls short is in a flattening of some of the characters, most notably Davey Moran. What really made the book tick was Davey's ambivalence about the situation; where the movie is just a depiction of a horrible crime, the book taken Davey's perceptions of all this and turns them into a perverse version of a bildungsroman. The movie attempts this, mostly by repeating Ketchum's wonderful opening monologue, presented by Davey as an adult, but the character of Davey in the frame of the story, when he is still twelve years old, is not ambiguous in the least; he's absolutely the good guy who's unable to do anything to save the damsel in distress. We get no inkling that Davey might well have fallen under Ruth's spell just as much as the rest of the neighborhood kids, and it's that question, always in the forefront of our minds as we read the novel, that really makes it turn. As we're identifying with Davey (and again, note that in the film version we're identifying with Meg; Davey is nothing more than a narrator for events in the film), we're exploring the idea of Stockholm Syndrome. The book is always making us question what we would do if we ever found ourselves in such a situation. The movie has none of this, and because of that, even the most brutal scenes ring somewhat hollow in comparison. Those of us who have read the book will always be aware that there is another layer, and that the film refuses to go there.It's good, for what it is, but there's no doubt it could have been a great deal more. ***",3,"Valiant, if flawed, attempt to adapt one of the great American novels.",1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,3560,"['Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'Gregory', 'Wilson', '2007', 'really', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Ketchum', 'novel', 'based', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Phil', 'Nutman', 'got', 'good', 'stable', 'actors', 'do', 'deed', 'So', 'why', 'ultimately', 'as', 'unsatisfying', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'cave', 'late', 'fifties', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'based', 'case', 'known', 'Indiana', 'Torture', 'Slaying', 'often', 'considered', 'most', 'horrific', 'crime', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'state', 'Indiana', 'two', 'girls', 'Sylvia', 'Jenny', 'Fay', 'Likens', 'had', 'been', 'sent', 'live', 'aunt', 'Gertrude', 'Baniszewski', 'details', 'are', 'cloudy', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'gruesome', 'death', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'almost', 'three', 'months', 'sustained', 'increasingly', 'brutal', 'torture', 'brought', 'combination', 'Likens', 'support', 'payments', 'not', 'showing', 'up', 'time', 'Baniszewski', 'deteriorating', 'mental', 'state', 'somehow', 'have', 'infected', 'not', 'only', 'sons', 'number', 'other', 'children', 'neighborhood', 'well.Ketchum', 'novel', 'thus', 'Wilson', 'film', 'point', 'view', 'one', 'neighbors', 'Davey', 'Moran', 'Daniel', 'Manche', 'currently', 'World', 'Turns', 'who', 'Sylvia', 'doppleganger', 'purposes', 'film', 'Meg', 'Loughlin', 'Keeping', 'Faith', 'Blythe', 'Auffarth', 'just', 'next', 'door', 'crazy', 'aunt', 'here', 'named', 'Ruth', 'Chandler', 'Blanche', 'Baker', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'disabled', 'sister', 'Susan', 'Madeline', 'Taylor', 'story', 'same', 'Chandler', 'snaps', 'Meg', 'object', 'rage', 'Chandler', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'complicity', 'actions', 'times', 'kids', 'mete', 'out', 'torture', 'can', 'be', 'denying', 'movie', 'exceptionally', 'effective', 'number', 'levels', 'almost', 'entirely', 'suggestion', 'innuendo', 'rarely', 'see', 'things', 'happen', 'here', 'thanks', 'creative', 'camera', 'angles', 'like', 'less', 'easy', 'identify', 'Meg', 'Loughlin', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'anyway', 'Where', 'short', 'flattening', 'characters', 'most', 'notably', 'Davey', 'Moran', 'What', 'really', 'made', 'book', 'tick', 'was', 'Davey', 'ambivalence', 'situation', 'where', 'movie', 'just', 'depiction', 'horrible', 'crime', 'book', 'taken', 'Davey', 'perceptions', 'perverse', 'version', 'bildungsroman', 'movie', 'mostly', 'repeating', 'Ketchum', 'wonderful', 'opening', 'monologue', 'presented', 'Davey', 'adult', 'character', 'Davey', 'frame', 'story', 'when', 'still', 'twelve', 'years', 'old', 'not', 'ambiguous', 'least', 'absolutely', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'unable', 'do', 'anything', 'save', 'damsel', 'distress', 'get', 'inkling', 'Davey', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'fallen', 'Ruth', 'spell', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'rest', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'question', 'always', 'forefront', 'minds', 'read', 'novel', 'really', 'turn', ""'re"", 'identifying', 'Davey', 'again', 'note', 'film', 'version', ""'re"", 'identifying', 'Meg', 'Davey', 'nothing', 'more', 'narrator', 'events', 'film', ""'re"", 'exploring', 'idea', 'Stockholm', 'Syndrome', 'book', 'always', 'making', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'ever', 'found', 'situation', 'movie', 'none', 'even', 'most', 'brutal', 'scenes', 'ring', 'somewhat', 'hollow', 'comparison', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'aware', 'layer', 'film', 'go', 'there.It', 'good', 'what', 'doubt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'deal', 'more', '***']",N/A
1108061,A2E96W60SMKKZL,B000WC38EQ,"Robert W. Grandcolas ""Stiggs""","[5, 12]","Bill Gibron, did an excellent, accurate and professional review on this tripe over at dvdtalk*com. I would like to make a few additional comments.First of all - the DVD box artwork gives the impression that the Girl Next Door is a substantial horror film. Especially since Stephen King's name is plastered on the front of the box. That the Girl Next Door is a horror film could not be further from the truth. That is an insult to all horror films and horror fans everywhere.So how to comment on a film that I would not want anyone to put their money towards?  How to write a review that won't entice the vilest of perverts to flock to and lay there money down on this film.  It can't be done, as there are always the sick and twisted who for whatever reason will create or salivate over the most base, banal, vile, nihilist debauchery simply because those qualities are the apex of their own virtues. Unbelievable or maybe believably Stephan King praised this junk by lending his name to the cover of the DVD box. In doing so, Mr. King added a ""bait and switch"" aspect to the marketing of this trash.  He should be ashamed - that is - if he did so willingly. If he did not? - then he should sue.I had a few one star reviews in my list of films that I have reviewed. I raised most of my one star reviews up a notch just so as to place The Girl Next Door at the very worst of my list of reviews. One of the films I merited as one-star was a piece of junk titled Cannibal Holocaust. The only reason I would give Cannibal Holocaust a lower rating then the Girl Next Door is that Cannibal Holocaust resorted to real live Animal cruelty and killing. But that is the only reason. Otherwise the Girl Next Door would easily be the worst and most worthless of the all the films I've reviewed.The Girl Next Door pretends to take place in the 50ish era of a semi-rural/semi-suburban USA. It attempts at aping the nostalgic look and feel of Stand By Me in setting, atmosphere with similar looking stereotyped white kids and their white parents.  Kind of a Leave It To Beaver in glossy, gauzy color but with a much phonier wistful feel.  This is clearly a slap at the white folks during this era as this trumped up idyllic nostalgia is saturated with endless, fowl, excruciatingly brutal child torture. This does not boarder on simulated child torture porn but IS simulated child torture porn. Director Gregory Wilson created it and stuck his camera in it and it conveys that he and his cameraman must have drooled over every disgusting and sick scene they conjured up and filmed.  They then edited and presented it as if there was an audience who might enjoy or could learn something from these images.  I would dare guess that they were projecting - and I wish I could say they were wrong - but look at the high stars gets on Amazon. Amazing.The blurbs on the DVD box state that the story is based on a true incident that occurred during the same time period as the film.  But if you read up on the actual incident you will find that much of the film, i.e. the conclusion and lives of the real people, were radically different from that of the film. This therefore makes the film useless as even a record of real events. This leaves the only apparent motive for this film as fodder for the most sick, twisted, sub-human interests.I'm not mincing words here. This film is the equivalent to someone filming Schindler's List and instead of showing a moving story, in-depth character study or a record of real events - chose to show close ups of Dr. Mengala butchering  helpless victims for 90 minutes. Or let's say a documentary of the French revolution and only showing people guillotined for 90 minutes. That is the level of aptitude that the people who made this film were working on.  There is nothing for any intelligent person to gain, and no insight into anything that takes place in The Girl Next Door. Any sensible person already knows that there are cruelties and anomalies in this world but knows that this is no reason to saturate and immerse themselves in these images for ninety minutes.  And those who feel otherwise?  One can only pity them.I was amazed that no one said ""STOP"" during the making of the film.  No one said ""wait what are we doing? This is wrong"" - not the producers, not the camera man, not the editor, not the lighting crew, not the parents of the child actors, not even the caterer.  As a matter of fact - now that I think about it- the makers of The Girl Next Door parallel the same attitudes and the behaviors of the predators of the film - the filmmakers like the cretins in the film continued on with their deviant project and not one of them said ""Stop! What are we doing!""What about the parents of the child actors in this film?  What were they thinking?  Was selling their souls so that little Johnny could be a movie star in a film like this worth it?  Is this film something little Johnny can ever be proud of? or show to his friends?  Ever?  What blinded these parents? Are they still proud that there little boy or girl was in the film?  Are they showing this film to their friends and family?  Just who would they show this film too?And as for the acting - other then the actor who played the protagonist's dad, the rest of acting in this film was the dredges including all the children.  No one seemed to be able to deliver a line. The blocking was amateurish and stagy and the closeups and set up shots clunky. I also noted that dialogue in this film was neither believable or true to life on any level.  I was a kid growing up around this time period in a similar white suburban town and I did not nor did I know anyone who spoke the way the morons in this film spoke or behaved.I'm sure the makers of this piece of K-rap defend it just like the talent-less dope who put a crucifix in a jar of p-p and called it art, and these same filmmakers probably defend this piece child torture porn as something ""we can all learn from.""In that I agree, yes, we can learn something. I learned it when I saw the long list of names during the end credits and then the five and four star reviews on Amazon. I learned that the Holocaust could happen again and likely in this century - but I did not learn this from watching the endless torture on display in this move but by the multitudes people who sanctioned this monstrosity by their collective involvement in the film, sanctioned it by attaching their names to the credits and sanctioned it with 50 plus positive reviews on amazon.",1,Dont be fooled!

A woman who hates women and herself, she takes her anger out by way of ""punishing"" the girls, Meg in particular, for the sins she imagines them to be guilty of.  It begins with verbal abuse and corporal punishment that was probably typical of the time and rapidly escalates to having Meg strung up in the basement to suffer far worse at the hands of Ruth, her sons, and other children from the neighborhood.Considering the novel appeared to be all but unfilmable, it is surprising how much content the filmmakers managed to include.  (Actually, it's surprising a film was made at all.)  However, there are two aspects of the production that keep it from reaching the levels of its source material.  Both of them involve character development.  The book spends a significant amount of time in its first act letting us get to know Meg, like her, and care about her.  This is crucial.  In the film, we see that Meg is a nice girl, and while obviously no one deserves what happens to her later, we simply don't have the same amount of emotional investment.  If the film had only spent another half hour on setting up the characters and their relationships, it might have come close to generating the kind of anguish that the novel did.  Here it just all happens to quickly.The other flaw is the removal of the first person narration from the main body of the story.  In the book this allowed us to be in the mind of the protagonist, a boy named David who is Meg's only friend and who loves her, yet becomes a passive accomplice in her torment anyway.  Many people who have watched this film come away wondering ""why didn't he do something?"" and they are correct to do so, for the film does not communicate the reasons well.  You really need to read the book to understand.  Do that, and then see the movie.  The film is difficult to watch, but the book will tear you apart.The DVD includes a making-of feature, interviews, and two worthwhile commentary tracks: one with the producer and director, and one with Ketchum and the screenwriters.",3,The Girl Next Door,1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,2512,"['Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'adapted', 'Jack', 'Ketchumnovelof', 'same', 'name', 'turn', 'was', 'inspired', 'real', 'life', 'case', 'Sylvia', 'Likens', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'tortured', 'death', 'Indiana', '1965', 'Ketchum', 'story', 'Meg', 'Loughlin', 'younger', 'sister', 'Susan', 'are', 'placed', 'care', 'Aunt', 'Ruth', 'parents', 'are', 'killed', 'automobile', 'accident', 'Ruth', 'however', 'mentally', 'ill', 'condition', 'suddenly', 'worsen', 'shortly', 'girls', 'arrive', 'A', 'woman', 'who', 'women', 'anger', 'out', 'way', 'punishing', 'girls', 'Meg', 'particular', 'sins', 'be', 'guilty', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'corporal', 'punishment', 'was', 'probably', 'typical', 'time', 'rapidly', 'having', 'Meg', 'strung', 'up', 'basement', 'suffer', 'far', 'worse', 'hands', 'Ruth', 'sons', 'other', 'children', 'neighborhood.Considering', 'novel', 'appeared', 'be', 'unfilmable', 'surprising', 'how', 'much', 'content', 'filmmakers', 'managed', 'include', 'Actually', 'surprising', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'However', 'are', 'two', 'aspects', 'production', 'keep', 'reaching', 'levels', 'source', 'material', 'involve', 'character', 'development', 'book', 'significant', 'amount', 'time', 'first', 'act', 'letting', 'get', 'know', 'Meg', 'care', 'crucial', 'film', 'see', 'Meg', 'nice', 'girl', 'obviously', 'one', 'what', 'later', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'amount', 'emotional', 'investment', 'film', 'had', 'only', 'spent', 'half', 'hour', 'setting', 'up', 'characters', 'relationships', 'might', 'have', 'come', 'close', 'generating', 'kind', 'anguish', 'novel', 'did', 'Here', 'just', 'quickly.The', 'other', 'flaw', 'removal', 'first', 'person', 'narration', 'main', 'body', 'story', 'book', 'allowed', 'be', 'mind', 'protagonist', 'boy', 'named', 'David', 'who', 'Meg', 'only', 'friend', 'who', 'yet', 'passive', 'accomplice', 'torment', 'anyway', 'Many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'come', 'away', 'wondering', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'something', 'are', 'correct', 'do', 'so', 'film', 'not', 'communicate', 'reasons', 'well', 'really', 'need', 'read', 'book', 'understand', 'Do', 'then', 'see', 'movie', 'film', 'difficult', 'watch', 'book', 'will', 'tear', 'apart.The', 'DVD', 'making-of', 'feature', 'interviews', 'two', 'worthwhile', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'producer', 'director', 'one', 'Ketchum', 'screenwriters']",N/A

1108070,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,B000WC38EQ,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[26, 32]","About a year ago I had read Jack Ketchum's novel, The Girl Next Door(after that I'd made it a point to read all of Ketchum's books), and found the book to be quite disturbing.  I've read eight billion novels over the years and very rarely have I found one that stuck with me after I'd read it.  I remember thinking it would make a powerful movie if done correctly, but it'd be damn near impossible to get what's on the pages onto the screen without an NC-17 rating.  I was excited hearing a few months ago that a movie had been made, but also quite worried.  I wanted to see it, but kept saying, ""please, please, do not screw this one up"".  They didn't.  About 15 minutes into the movie, I was happy to see the tone, the look, the choice of actors was dead on.  It includes practically all of the novel and only makes a few very minor changes.  Since the novel is told in first person, you don't get quite all of the main character's thoughts, but it doesn't effect the movie coz the performance of the young boy is so good.  It deals with a kid(David) in the 50s who meets a girl who has moved in next door.  The girl(Meg) and her younger sister(Susan) have come to live with their aunt Ruth and her two sons after both their parents had died in a car crash.  Ruth and her sons are David's best friends, and he comes and goes as he pleases to their home, as well as pretty much any kid in the neighborhood.  Ruth's home is kind of the big hangout spot for the kids in the neighborhood.  Ruth lets them drink beer and swear, and all the boys like her.  Soon, Ruth slowly loses her mind and begins a process of abuse and downright ghastly torture on Meg.  She's tied up in the basement and subjected to all manner of horrible tortures.  The neighborhood kids all drop by and participate in these events as well.  David seems to be the only one who knows this is all wrong, but feels powerless to help.  Doesn't sound realistic?  How could a bunch of neighborhood kids torture a girl and no one find out about it?  Well, truth is stranger than fiction.  Ketchum based this on a real crime that happened in the 60s.  Although much of the story is fictionalized, the main gist of the crime is here.  This is an extraordinarily unpleasant movie.  It's extremely well made, but like for instance, Requiem For A Dream, though well made, would you really wanna watch it over and over?  Apparently this movie took nine years to see the light of day.  I simply can't help but think that the current slew of torture based crap films made this movie possible.  Make no mistake about it though, this isn't Eli Roth's cartoony torture chamber of rubber limbs and American Pie jokes.  This'll kick you square in your ass, and show practically no gore in doing so.  This is all made possible through the direction of Greg Wilson(a director to watch.  I get the feeling we should be seeing interesting stuff from him in the future), who's still kind of a newcomer, but obviously not a Hollywood puppet from the school of rock videos and tv commercials.  The casting and performances couldn't have been better, especially Blanche Baker as Ruth.  I don't know if I've ever seen a more sinister woman on screen before.  She is wicked, wicked, WICKED.  I certainly have nothing to fear from a wrinkled old bag, and I found her creepy!  Director Wilson states in the bonus features that this story has no redeeming value because it has no good guy and really no message exactly.  This is true, you may be wondering what the point of this film is(of course you can ask that about alot of films).  I suppose that's for the viewer to decide, but I can say that it does open your eyes to the extent of child abuse that may be happening right now.  It also gives a face to the real victim who died so long ago.  You may not wanna watch this movie over and over, but you may not have to coz it won't be so easy to forget.",5,My Lucky Stars!

I have to say that I was a bit offended by the embellishments made in this screenplay; it's hard to explain why though.

1108075,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B000WC38EQ,Todd Smith,"[1, 2]","Jack Ketchum's 1989 novel and the subsequent film are based on one of the most infamous sex crimes in American history. The crime was truly horrific, unfortunately the film is equally as bad. The story is about a young girl who is living with a relative for the summer, a twisted and evil relative, who not only abuses the girl, but allows the neighborhood children to take advantage of her as well. The story is more than a little disturbing, but it's made worse by a film that is ridiculously tedious and boring. This story was much too straight forward and simplistic to make for a good movie, especially when they're choosing to focus on the crime itself. The one bright spot in this movie is soap actor, Daniel Manche. I'd never even heard of him prior to this film, but he was really great. It's a shame this film was so bad and cost him the recognition he deserved, but this kid was on target and really displayed the emotions that the viewers were feeling. There is another film about this crime, which focuses specifically on the ensuing trial resulting from the crime. It's called An American Crime, and while I already know the outcome, I have to see it, because it stars one of my favorite actors, Jeremy Sumpter.

I rate films primarily based on how much I personally enjoyed them with artistic credibility and execution coming secondary.  This is not a film to be enjoyed.  It has absolutely zero entertainment value.  I never want to see it again.  However, a work of art is defined by me as something that conveys or instigates feelings in the person experiencing it, and this movie meets that standard to the utmost.  It's a genre of film that I call ""soul scorchers"" and it exists only to cause the viewer pain.  Other entries into this genre includeSchindler's List,The Passion of the Christ, andGrave of the Fireflies. I do not like these kind of movies, but I consider them an occasional must-watch lest we forget the brutality and sickness that pervades the human race. And this is the king of them all for sheer evil. Anybody who honestly enjoys this film is a sick individual, and so is anybody who is not moved by it.One of the things that sickens me about today's media is the way that the 50's are held up as the pinnacle of American existence.  As if the fact that people back then simply didn't discuss the perversion and brutality of thier society in public somehow means that such things didn't exist.  Statistics show that juvenile crime, for instance, was out of control and far exceeded the purported viciousness of today's youth.  People under the age of 18 committed 53.6 percent of all car thefts; 49.3 percent of all burglaries; 18 percent of all robberies, and 16.2 percent of all rapes according to the FBI.  Picture that for a second.  The greatest generation.  Riiiiiiight.  The difference is the culture was of a ""don't ask don't tell"" mentality and so everybody ignored the neighbor's everyday brutalizing of his spouse and pretended everything was hunky-dory.  But every now and then, an author shines a light on the dark corners of America's dillusions about ""the good ol' days"" and tells it like it was.  Jack Ketchum's novelThe Girl Next Doorwas inspired by a disturbing true story of a woman who had a young girl left in her care.  It was a more innocent time, as they say, where children always knew that they could trust adults and authority figures and they did as they were told and were seen and not heard.  Ah, those were the days, eh?Back to the film. If you have not seen it, wish to have your soul scorched, and don't want to know any more about what happens, skip to the end because I will be discussing a few spoilers. This adaptation of Ketchum's novel is among the bleakest and most maddening cinematic works I've ever seen.  As a story unto itself, it is nearly devoid of merit.  It's more like 20 minutes of setup followed by 70 minutes of pure pain that escalates in brutality right up to the absolutely excruciating and sickening climax.  This is hardly the first film to psycologically harm it's viewers with the sights and sounds of physical, mental, and sexual torture.  But it's the first I've ever seen where the subject is a child and there is very little retribution.I Spit On Your GraveandThe Last House on the Leftboth featured extended sequences of unspeakable suffering and perversion enacted upon the innocent which served to drive the audience's mental cry for blood to the point where the atrocities of the second half of the film served as catharsis and bloody satisfaction, satiating the inherent psychological need for revenge.  ""The Girl Next Door"" fails in part because it simply leaves the viewer alone and unfulfilled with their anger over the vile acts they've just witnessed.  This pretty much killed the movie for me.  I've never seen a film before where I wanted to physically jump into the television and brutalize woman and child.  But this film stirred exactly those kinds of feelings in me.  I tell you this not to spoil the film for you or to tell you not to watch it, but to warn you so that you know what you're getting into.The performances in this film are masterful.  There is not one minute I didn't believe what I was seeing.  I don't know how the director could ever stand to shoot such a thing with so many children, but he did and he absolutely got what he was looking for. Blanche Baker as Aunt Ruth is one of the most disgusting cinematic villains in the history of the art form.  The way she justifies beating the girl's crippled younger sister by saying she was ""in connivance"" with her in spite of the fact that she had done nothing at all is made all the more nauseating by the fact that she makes all of the children watch her torture of the girls, thereby putting them ""in connivance"" with the crimes she commits as well as a way to keep them silent.  Eventually, she corrupts them to the point where they are willing and even enthusiastic participants.  Her motives are hinted at through her bizarre justifications for the acts she commits, but I think we can all agree that she is simply a very sick woman.  There is also a scene where the protagonist's moronic father gives a very 50's-era answer to the simple question of if it's okay to hit a woman that has to be seen to be believed.  It's almost comedy, but is just too disturbingly true to that mindset to be actually funny.Spoilers go bye-bye now.  As a truthful rebuke of the popular image of America the 1950's, and in terms of causing maximum distress to the viewer ""The Girl Next Door"" is a masterpiece.  But as a story and piece of entertainment it is, as I said before, almost completely without merit. I can't imagine a healthy human being wanting to see this more then once.  It's one of those experiences that you can never unsee and will not forget and hopefully, if nothing else, will serve as a reminder of the capacity your fellow humans possess for senseless cruelty.  If you think you can stomach such a thing, consider this a high recommendation.  But if you are looking for a flick to watch on family night or with your new girlfriend then this is about the last thing you want to put on.  Giving the film a perfect artistic score and no entertainment score I'm going with......2 1/2 stars, rounded up because baby boomers are delusional.",3,"""You think you know about

1108079,AEE52GO98PFOL,B000WC38EQ,Tyr Shadowblade (TM),"[1, 3]","When I first saw this DVD on the New Release wall I was shocked, as it hadn't been released in theaters here and I didn't even know the film had gone into production . . . but there it was, a DVD release of a film that I never expected to see made.  I looked at the box for a few moments before putting it down and walking away.  I did not want to see this movie . . . in fact, I was scared to.I read Ketchum's THE GIRL NEXT DOOR a few years earlier and was traumatized by the experience.  It pained my soul.  I had to drink a few shots to dull the horror of the words before me.  I cried.  I punched the wall.  I felt ill for a week.  I had nightmares.  Then, I put it out of my mind . . . until I saw this DVD in the video store . . . and it all came back.  It took me a month before I finally worked up the courage to rent it.It wasn't nearly as upsetting as I thought it would be . . . not even close to being on the same level as the book.  The torture scenes don't begin until the final third of the film, and since I knew what to expect the shock was reduced . . . and a number of scenes were omitted from the screenplay.  It was watchable, which surprised and relieved me.Evil exists in the world, though many deny it, and this story depicts evil in its most raw and horrendous form: systematic, ritualized child abuse which is not only perpetrated by the lawful guardian, but at her encouragement a number of neighborhood children are also brought in to participate in the torture of an innocent child . . . which some engage in with cruelty and glee; while others stand by in stunned silence, yet agree to keep the proceedings ""secret"" from parents and authorities.  It is a terrifying story because it is based on fact.I cannot give this film 5-stars due to several factors, primarilly due to the actions of the producers in rewriting the final act without the knowledge or consent of the author or screenwriters in a misguided effort to make the film more accessable and marketable (read as: Deux ex Machina + Hollywood ending) . . . the girl still dies at the end, but aside from that the travesty of the final 15 minutes is unrecognizable made-for-TV silliness, for which the producers should be soundly flogged.  Was a little perturbed by the opening scene with the bum on the street as well.  I wish the movie was truer to Ketchum's original vision . . . but then, as the producers claimed in the commentary, it probably never would've been made.  This script supposedly was written nearly 10 years ago, and no major studio would touch it . . . and when someone finally takes that step they elect to overhaul the ending.This is a powerful and worthwhile film, but the producers' ill-thought decision to rewrite the ending prevents it from being the most powerful and unforgettable film ever made . . . it's probably not even in the Top 10 . . . but at least the film was finally made, flawed though it might be.While I'm in complete disagreement with the producers' decision, they probably did have a valid point.  In the final half hour of their commentary they repeatedly attempt to justify what they did, primarilly citing time constraints and production costs.  But what was probably more of a factor was the risk of getting slapped with an NC-17 rating or receiving a majority of bad reviews from folks who were emotionally devastated by what they'd seen.  They thought that a dramatic-thriller ending was what the script needed to make it fly, and while it does sort of work it hamstrings any chance of potential greatness.  Unfortunately, the average audience member would be angered by a hollow, bleak, depressing conclusion to their cinematic experience.  This DVD sorely needs an alternate ending for those of us with above-average expectations.",4,An important and misunderstood film,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,3771,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'DVD', 'New', 'Release', 'wall', 'was', 'shocked', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'theaters', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'film', 'had', 'gone', 'production', 'was', 'DVD', 'release', 'film', 'never', 'expected', 'see', 'made', 'looked', 'box', 'few', 'moments', 'putting', 'down', 'walking', 'away', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'fact', 'was', 'scared', 'to.I', 'read', 'Ketchum', 'THE', 'GIRL', 'NEXT', 'DOOR', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'was', 'traumatized', 'experience', 'pained', 'soul', 'had', 'drink', 'few', 'shots', 'dull', 'horror', 'words', 'cried', 'punched', 'wall', 'felt', 'ill', 'week', 'had', 'nightmares', 'Then', 'put', 'mind', 'saw', 'DVD', 'video', 'store', 'came', 'back', 'took', 'month', 'finally', 'worked', 'up', 'courage', 'rent', 'it.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'upsetting', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'being', 'same', 'level', 'book', 'torture', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'begin', 'final', 'third', 'film', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'shock', 'was', 'reduced', 'number', 'scenes', 'were', 'omitted', 'screenplay', 'was', 'watchable', 'surprised', 'relieved', 'me.Evil', 'exists', 'world', 'many', 'deny', 'story', 'evil', 'most', 'raw', 'horrendous', 'form', 'systematic', 'ritualized', 'child', 'abuse', 'not', 'only', 'perpetrated', 'lawful', 'guardian', 'encouragement', 'number', 'neighborhood', 'children', 'are', 'also', 'brought', 'participate', 'torture', 'innocent', 'child', 'engage', 'cruelty', 'glee', 'others', 'stand', 'stunned', 'silence', 'yet', 'agree', 'keep', 'proceedings', 'secret', 'parents', 'authorities', 'terrifying', 'story', 'based', 'fact.I', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'film', '5-stars', 'due', 'several', 'factors', 'primarilly', 'due', 'actions', 'producers', 'rewriting', 'final', 'act', 'knowledge', 'consent', 'author', 'screenwriters', 'misguided', 'effort', 'make', 'film', 'more', 'accessable', 'marketable', 'read', 'Deux', 'ex', 'Machina', '+', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'girl', 'still', 'end', 'aside', 'travesty', 'final', '15', 'minutes', 'unrecognizable', 'made-for-TV', 'silliness', 'producers', 'should', 'be', 'soundly', 'flogged', 'Was', 'little', 'perturbed', 'opening', 'scene', 'bum', 'street', 'as', 'well', 'wish', 'movie', 'was', 'truer', 'Ketchum', 'original', 'vision', 'then', 'producers', 'claimed', 'commentary', 'probably', 'never', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'made', 'script', 'supposedly', 'was', 'written', 'nearly', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'major', 'studio', 'would', 'touch', 'when', 'someone', 'finally', 'step', 'elect', 'overhaul', 'ending.This', 'powerful', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'producers', 'ill-thought', 'decision', 'rewrite', 'ending', 'prevents', 'being', 'most', 'powerful', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'probably', 'not', 'even', 'Top', '10', 'least', 'film', 'was', 'finally', 'made', 'flawed', 'might', 'be.While', ""'m"", 'complete', 'disagreement', 'producers', 'decision', 'probably', 'did', 'have', 'valid', 'point', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'commentary', 'repeatedly', 'attempt', 'justify', 'what', 'did', 'primarilly', 'citing', 'time', 'constraints', 'production', 'costs', 'what', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'factor', 'was', 'risk', 'getting', 'slapped', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'receiving', 'majority', 'bad', 'reviews', 'folks', 'who', 'were', 'emotionally', 'devastated', 'what', ""'d"", 'seen', 'thought', 'dramatic-thriller', 'ending', 'was', 'what', 'script', 'needed', 'make', 'fly', 'sort', 'work', 'chance', 'potential', 'greatness', 'Unfortunately', 'average', 'audience', 'member', 'would', 'be', 'angered', 'hollow', 'bleak', 'depressing', 'conclusion', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'DVD', 'sorely', 'alternate', 'ending', 'above-average', 'expectations']",N/A

1108084,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B000WC38EQ,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[114, 126]","THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is a film based on Jack Ketchum's novel, which is based on true events. I've seen a lot of horror films in my time, and I have to say that the scariest ones are always the ones that hit close to home. When you read the newspaper, watch the news, you sometimes see and hear things that are almost unbelievable that humanity can sink into such aberrations. This film borders around the line between exploitation and voyeurism, but believe me, ""The Girl Next Door is a realistic, disturbing and genuine journey into one girl's personal hell.Synopsis derived from the dvd back cover:In a quiet suburban town in the summer of 1958, two recently orphaned sisters are placed in the care of their mentally unstable Aunt Ruth (Blanche Baker). But Ruth's depraved sense of will soon lead to unspeakable acts of abuse and torture that involve her three young sons, the neighborhood kids, and one 12-year old boy whose life will be changed forever.People may say that some stories don't need to be told and I agree with them. ""The Girl Next door"" is arguably something that should have been left on the shelf. However, those who deny such stories also naively deny the twisted reality of life sometimes. This film is sort of a ""coming of age"" piece with a very dark, edgy premise that plays like a morality drama. In viewing this film, the viewer has to get pass the disturbingly graphic images to be able to appreciate its subtext, otherwise one will think that it is an exploitation flick with minors involved. Being based on a true story, the viewer has to keep in mind that this case did happen, and may POSSIBLY happen again somewhere.The viewer has to pay special attention to the film's themes in order to understand why director Gregory Wilson opted to make this disturbing film. ""The Girl Next door"" is a tale of unfulfilled love, the moral responsibilities of adults, helplessness of children, and for people to be sensitive to what's going on. All these themes revolve around the film's main premise; abuse and the violence against women. The film is an emotion-driven film, no, it doesn't play on the graphic images and torture as much as the tiresome Eli Roth torture flicks. The film-makers knew what they were doing when they shot this film. They paid extra attention to the needed emotions inherent when one experiences such an ordeal. Meg, a pretty, innocent young girl is the victim. She loses all that she holds dear to humiliation, abuse and torture. Meg's sister is a victim of her own helplessness and fear. David is a young boy is sort of a victim also. He loses his innocence and up to his days as an adult, (as shown in the film's beginning and the climax) he still wishes that he could have done something to save Meg. David is a victim of his own conscience. Even Ruth's three boys are victims in their own way. They are victims of Ruth's twisted upbringing and philosophies on life and women. What is truly almost unbelievable is that the neighborhood kids are insensitive to Meg's plight, in fact, they seem to enjoy it. People may argue that some kids don't know what abuse is, thank goodness, my parents brought me up to be able to identify such things. Also, in this situation, ""birds of the same feather flock together...""The true instigator of the children's ordeal is Aunt Ruth; played by Blanche Baker. The actress makes an outstanding performance. Baker's portrayal as the main antagonist is realistic, disturbing and creepy in her own way. I've read somewhere before that the most dangerous psychopaths are those who think they are noble and serving a just cause. Such is the case with Aunt Ruth. Aunt Ruth preaches her mad, twisted indignation to her children (and to David) with convincing fervor that I couldn't blame them into buying into what she's saying. Another intense human horror is revealed: children do try to emulate their elders.Now, I haven't read the novel and I'm pretty sure the book will have more answers. The film isn't perfect, some characters aren't fleshed out and ""happy"" people will no doubt have a lot of difficulty connecting to its story line. Also, David's parents are a bit one-dimensional and felt like they were minor plot devices to emphasize David's tortured conscience. The film however, does a lot more things right than wrong. I rather thought that it was very ingenious for the screenplay to show David as an adult haunted with his past nightmare, and how he has never forgotten his childhood friend; Meg. That up to this day, he wants to do something good to another being even at the price of his own life.""The Girl Next Door"" is not a film for everyone. Controversial and disturbing to its core, the film will no doubt offend a lot of viewers but if you look at the subtle messages instead of the graphic scenes, viewers will learn to appreciate what the film's premise is all about. This film is an unrelenting look at human horror that will stay with the viewer for a long time to come. Forget monsters, vampires, demons and werewolves, the scariest thing may just be occurring right next door...Recommended timidly. The film is of such disturbing nature that only the most timid recommendation may be given.
