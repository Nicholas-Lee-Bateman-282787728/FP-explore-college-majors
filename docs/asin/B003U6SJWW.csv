Stine and followed the Twilight Zone vein, but on the lighter side, besides from each twisted ending.Here we get three more episodes:The Blog that Ate Everyone has aspiring horror writer Zack Beauchamp finding an old typewriter and he types a story about a pink blob that is terrifying everyone. There is one problem with his story, the blob has come to life.My Hairiest Adventure finds Larry Boyd and his band mates trying on the Insta-Tan they found, but they don't get a tan. Instead they start to grow hair.Piano Lessons Can Be Murder tells the tale of Jerry who takes piano lessons from the strange Dr. Shreek, but then Jerry starts seeing ghosts of the teacher's former students.These three classic Goosebumps episodes are great to watch with your kids around Halloween.",4,"The Pink, Slimy Blob!",1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,852,"['Goosebumps', 'aired', 'Fox', 'kids', 'series', '1990s', 'based', 'books', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'followed', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'vein', 'lighter', 'side', 'twisted', 'ending.Here', 'get', 'three', 'more', 'episodes', 'Blog', 'Ate', 'Everyone', 'aspiring', 'horror', 'writer', 'Zack', 'Beauchamp', 'finding', 'old', 'typewriter', 'story', 'pink', 'blob', 'terrifying', 'everyone', 'one', 'problem', 'story', 'blob', 'come', 'life.My', 'Hairiest', 'Adventure', 'Larry', 'Boyd', 'band', 'trying', 'Insta-Tan', 'found', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'tan', 'Instead', 'start', 'grow', 'hair.Piano', 'Lessons', 'Can', 'Be', 'Murder', 'tale', 'Jerry', 'who', 'piano', 'lessons', 'strange', 'Dr.', 'Shreek', 'then', 'Jerry', 'seeing', 'ghosts', 'teacher', 'former', 'students.These', 'three', 'classic', 'Goosebumps', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'watch', 'kids', 'Halloween']",N/A

1363050,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B003U6SJWW,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[8, 10]","This DVD contains three scary stories based on the children's books by R.L. Stine.The first episode is entitled ""The Blob That Ate Everyone"".  Zack dreams of becoming a horror writer.  One day after school, Zack and his friend Alex discover an abandoned shop.  Inside the shop is an old typewriter.  Immediately intrigued by its possibilities for his writing potential, Zack scoops up the typewriter and heads home.  However, weird things begin to happen as Zack begins to type.  Everything that Zack types becomes real.  It begins innocently enough, with a thunderstorm, then the lights go out in the house.  But when one of Zack's classmates writes about the blob that ate everyone, you can guess what happened next..Episode two is called ""My Hairiest Adventure"".  Larry and his band are rehearsing for an upcoming concert when they discover a bottle of instant tanning oil.  When Larry puts it on, instead of getting a cool bronze tan, he begins to grow hair!  To make matters worse for him, he's constantly being followed by a pack of dogs, and these dogs are more than they seem.  Will he be able to get rid of the hair and break the mystery of the dogs before its too late?The final episode is called ""Piano Lessons Can Be Murder"".  Jerry has just moved into a new house, and he and his father discover an old piano in the basement.  But, that's not all that Jerry sees.  he also sees the ghostly image of a woman warning him about the piano.  Undeterred, Jerry decides to take lessons at the Shreek music school.  But the mysterious Dr. Shreek is hiding a secret of his own.My children have enjoyed the ""Goosebumps"" videos for several years, and this collection is very good.  The stories are scary, but they are not REALLY scary like a horror movie.  These videos are appropriate for most children.I highly recommend this fine DVD.  Your children will certainly get a good scare (and laugh) from this collection of ""Goosebumps"" stories.",5,More Scary Stories From R.L.

In fact they should have put this out in a normal series way. but Instead it's three episodes per dvd.  Today we have r.l. stines haunted stories show which is actually scarier and more teen orientated. Todays show has cgi effects , but this one has alot of charm and effects that are good and old school all the way. After all this was  as show from the 90's-early 00's.

1363052,AUNL7H2TKVSMC,B003U6SJWW,MomOf3,"[0, 0]",Bought this as a Halloween movie marathon treat for my kids this year.  This has 3 @20 minute episodes on it.  What I enjoy out of them is that they are &#34;clean&#34; horror flicks for younger kids.  I have 7 yr old twins and a 4 yr and they all enjoyed it.  You can tell these were TV episodes due to the pauses made during them which would have been commercials when aired.  Does not take away from it and if anything it adds to the childrens' suspense.The Blob that ate everyone:  To me as an adult - it looked vastly fake and the kids really didn't understand the whole basis of a blob due to this.Piano lessons are murder:  Dropping off your child with strangers and never believing a thing he said - enough said right there.My hairiest adventure - my kids enjoyed this one the most due to the laugh factor,4,Clean and family friendly spooks,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,813,"['Bought', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'marathon', 'treat', 'kids', 'year', '3', '@', '20', 'minute', 'episodes', 'What', 'enjoy', 'are', '34', 'clean', '34', 'horror', 'flicks', 'younger', 'kids', 'have', '7', 'yr', 'old', 'twins', '4', 'yr', 'enjoyed', 'can', 'tell', 'were', 'TV', 'episodes', 'due', 'pauses', 'made', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'commercials', 'when', 'aired', 'not', 'take', 'away', 'anything', 'childrens', 'suspense.The', 'Blob', 'ate', 'everyone', 'adult', 'looked', 'vastly', 'fake', 'kids', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'whole', 'basis', 'blob', 'due', 'this.Piano', 'lessons', 'are', 'murder', 'Dropping', 'off', 'child', 'strangers', 'never', 'believing', 'thing', 'said', 'enough', 'said', 'right', 'there.My', 'hairiest', 'adventure', 'kids', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'most', 'due', 'laugh', 'factor']",N/A
