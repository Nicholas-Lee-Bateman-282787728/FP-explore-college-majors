E Jackson,"[1, 1]","While I didn't personally enjoy the Break-Up Artist because it felt too much like a ""girly-girl"" type of comedy to me (you know, the type of comedy where girls drag their boyfriends to the movie theaters to watch- ugh!) it's far from awful.In fact the concept is fairly original and creative- a woman actually works for a company that breaks up relationships.  This means the woman goes to restaurants and other places and tells the women or men that their partner is no longer interested in them.  Talk about an extremely rough, emotionless business, haha.  This of course leads to plenty of shocked, saddened, and disappointed reactions from her clients.Anyway, the jokes feel like they were designed in a way that girls would find much funnier than guys, so I felt kind of awkward watching it, but hey- a movie with some originality deserves a bit of credit, so a rating of 4 out of 5 stars seems pretty spot on.",4,a different type of comedy,1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,915,"['did', ""n't"", 'personally', 'enjoy', 'Break-Up', 'Artist', 'felt', 'too', 'much', 'girly-girl', 'type', 'comedy', 'know', 'type', 'comedy', 'where', 'girls', 'drag', 'boyfriends', 'movie', 'theaters', 'watch-', 'ugh', 'far', 'awful.In', 'fact', 'concept', 'fairly', 'original', 'creative-', 'woman', 'actually', 'company', 'up', 'relationships', 'woman', 'restaurants', 'other', 'places', 'women', 'men', 'partner', 'no', 'longer', 'interested', 'Talk', 'extremely', 'rough', 'emotionless', 'business', 'haha', 'course', 'leads', 'plenty', 'shocked', 'saddened', 'disappointed', 'reactions', 'clients.Anyway', 'jokes', 'feel', 'were', 'designed', 'way', 'girls', 'would', 'find', 'much', 'funnier', 'guys', 'felt', 'kind', 'awkward', 'watching', 'movie', 'originality', 'bit', 'credit', 'rating', '4', '5', 'stars', 'pretty', 'spot']",N/A

1278097,A2QU05H6Y0DPNC,B002MCI93Y,Romantic Glutton,"[0, 0]","Britney is a professional relationship ender. She describes breaking up as falling down as a kid and scuffing your knee- she's the kiss that makes it better. She's gentle and funny when ending relationships for people, and seems to make killer money doing it. Life is perfect for Britney- she's got her best girl friends, her own business and doesn't have to worry about that pesky thing called ""love"" for herself. Until she meets Rick... a man who sweeps her off her feet. Only Rick isn't who he seems to be. He's an impostor and he's set on stealing Britney's business away and breaking her heart as well.In order to save her crumbling business, Britney takes a ""job"" from her sister Ashley's ex-boyfriend Mike. Mike wants Ashley back and will stop at nothing to get her. He offers Britney the money she needs to recover her losses if only she'll help him win back her sister. So Britney does something she's never done- she uses all of her knowledge of why relationships go bad to try to help this man repair his relationship. What follows is a funny, touching and engaging romantic comedy of two unlikely individuals finding themselves, and each other.I'm always on the search for a good, solid, romantic comedy and I'm often disappointed. It's interesting that with all the big celebrity names out there on some pretty lame movies... this little B-budget cutie really won me over. It's an original idea, the acting is sweet and authentic, and it really did bring a smile to my face. Amanda Crew in the lead role is surprisingly hilarious and relatable. When she was on the screen, I couldn't take my eyes off. Ryan Kennedy as Mike is a perfect, scruffy artist who is gorgeous and sweet.Overall, this is one to catch. It's a feel-good romantic comedy that has enough laughs to lift your spirit and a nice little ending that really worked for me. Why not five stars?  Some of the acting is a bit cartoony- mostly Rick and the girlfriends. But overall, this is a winner.",4,Really solid and engaging romantic comedy- recommended!,1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,1972,"['Britney', 'professional', 'relationship', 'ender', 'breaking', 'up', 'falling', 'down', 'kid', 'scuffing', 'knee-', 'kiss', 'better', 'gentle', 'funny', 'when', 'ending', 'relationships', 'people', 'make', 'killer', 'money', 'doing', 'Life', 'perfect', 'Britney-', 'got', 'best', 'girl', 'friends', 'own', 'business', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'pesky', 'thing', 'called', 'love', 'herself', 'Rick', 'man', 'who', 'off', 'feet', 'Only', 'Rick', ""n't"", 'who', 'be', 'impostor', 'set', 'stealing', 'Britney', 'business', 'away', 'breaking', 'heart', 'well.In', 'order', 'save', 'crumbling', 'business', 'Britney', 'job', 'sister', 'Ashley', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Mike', 'Mike', 'Ashley', 'back', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'money', 'recover', 'losses', 'only', ""'ll"", 'help', 'win', 'back', 'sister', 'Britney', 'something', 'never', 'done-', 'knowledge', 'why', 'relationships', 'go', 'bad', 'try', 'help', 'man', 'relationship', 'What', 'funny', 'touching', 'engaging', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'unlikely', 'individuals', 'finding', 'other.I', ""'m"", 'always', 'search', 'good', 'solid', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""'m"", 'often', 'disappointed', 'interesting', 'big', 'celebrity', 'out', 'there', 'pretty', 'lame', 'movies', 'little', 'B-budget', 'cutie', 'really', 'won', 'over', 'original', 'idea', 'acting', 'sweet', 'authentic', 'really', 'did', 'bring', 'smile', 'face', 'Amanda', 'Crew', 'lead', 'role', 'surprisingly', 'hilarious', 'relatable', 'When', 'was', 'screen', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'off', 'Ryan', 'Kennedy', 'Mike', 'perfect', 'scruffy', 'artist', 'who', 'gorgeous', 'sweet.Overall', 'one', 'catch', 'feel-good', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'enough', 'laughs', 'lift', 'spirit', 'nice', 'little', 'ending', 'really', 'worked', 'Why', 'not', 'five', 'stars', 'acting', 'bit', 'cartoony-', 'mostly', 'Rick', 'girlfriends', 'overall', 'winner']",N/A
