""THE BOY WHO PAINTED JESUS BLACK"" IS VERY WARMING TO MY HEART. I BOUGHT THE DVD BECAUSE WESLEY SNIPES IS IN IT. THE STORY EXPRESSES HOW CHILDREN HAVE THEIR INNOCENT MINDS AND THEY DO THINK AND BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. I ENJOYED ALL OF THE CHILDREN IN IT. THE WHOLE DVD STORIES ARE SOME REAL LIFE THINGS AND WILL HOLD YOUR ATTENTION AND CAPTIVATE YOUR HEART. I LOVE IT AND WILL WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AS I HAVE ALL OF WESLEY SNIPES MOVIES.
