It also felt like watching some horrific B snuff film. It was like the director wanted people to get turned on by what they were watching. I fast forwarded throught 99% of the film, I just could not believe what they did to the memory of the victims, and how horrible this would be for their families. This is by far the worst movie ever made...Cabin Fever would be a better investment!

952949,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000BYA5H8,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","This is a disastrously bad, ridiculous excuse of a film.  You would think the life and crimes of a man who killed dozens and dozens of women over the course of two decades would be interesting enough for any director, but Ulli Lommel threw accuracy out of the window whenever he felt like it (either that, or he couldn't even be bothered in the first place to do a Google search for Green River Killer).  Based on what I saw here, all Lommel knows about these infamous crimes is that some fellow named Gary Ridgway killed a bunch of prostitutes in the Seattle area in the 1970s.  I'm not talking about the kind of problems that can be blamed on a low budget here; Lommel either didn't know or just didn't care about the facts.In the movie, Ridgway picks up all of his prostitutes at this tiny bar, leading each girl out in front of the same group of people time and time again.  Even when it finally dawns on the bar owner that this same weird dude left with all of her working girls right before they died or went missing, and she mentions it to the police (who seemingly don't care that she's a madam), Ridgway keeps on doing it - and no one seems to be the wiser.  Anyone of these regular bar patrons could have identified the killer, no matter how much beer poured through their bloodstreams.  Then there's Ridgway's job.  In real life, he did detailed custom painting at a trucking plant; in the movie, all he does is move boxes at some warehouse.  It's hilarious, really; he and his two co-workers literally pick up boxes and move them from one stack to an adjacent stack over and over again.  Then you have one scene showing Ridgway killing a prostitute in his house while his obviously troubled young son is in the other room.  That never happened in real life, and I find it quite odious that Lommel would take such offensive liberties with this unfortunate boy.  And don't even get me started with the salacious little tidbit Lommel chose to throw in at the very end.  This man obviously has no shame.Lommel isn't even talented enough to be an amateur filmmaker, in my opinion.  Green River Killer is a disgraceful, incompetent film in every possible way.  If you're going to exploit the victims of an inhuman serial killer for profit, at least show them or the audience a little respect.",1,"If incompetent filmmaking were a crime, Ulli Lommel would be on death row",1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,2298,"['disastrously', 'bad', 'ridiculous', 'excuse', 'film', 'would', 'think', 'life', 'crimes', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'women', 'course', 'two', 'decades', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'enough', 'director', 'Ulli', 'Lommel', 'threw', 'accuracy', 'window', 'whenever', 'felt', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'bothered', 'first', 'place', 'do', 'Google', 'search', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'Based', 'what', 'saw', 'here', 'Lommel', 'infamous', 'crimes', 'fellow', 'named', 'Gary', 'Ridgway', 'killed', 'bunch', 'prostitutes', 'Seattle', 'area', '1970s', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'kind', 'problems', 'can', 'be', 'blamed', 'low', 'budget', 'here', 'Lommel', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'facts.In', 'movie', 'Ridgway', 'up', 'prostitutes', 'tiny', 'bar', 'leading', 'girl', 'out', 'front', 'same', 'group', 'people', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Even', 'when', 'finally', 'bar', 'owner', 'same', 'weird', 'dude', 'left', 'working', 'girls', 'right', 'died', 'went', 'missing', 'police', 'who', 'seemingly', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'madam', 'Ridgway', 'doing', 'one', 'be', 'wiser', 'Anyone', 'regular', 'bar', 'patrons', 'could', 'have', 'identified', 'killer', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'beer', 'poured', 'bloodstreams', 'Then', 'Ridgway', 'job', 'real', 'life', 'did', 'detailed', 'custom', 'painting', 'trucking', 'plant', 'movie', 'move', 'boxes', 'warehouse', 'hilarious', 'really', 'two', 'co-workers', 'literally', 'pick', 'up', 'boxes', 'move', 'one', 'stack', 'adjacent', 'stack', 'over', 'again', 'Then', 'have', 'one', 'scene', 'showing', 'Ridgway', 'killing', 'prostitute', 'house', 'obviously', 'troubled', 'young', 'son', 'other', 'room', 'never', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'find', 'quite', 'odious', 'Lommel', 'would', 'take', 'such', 'offensive', 'liberties', 'unfortunate', 'boy', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'salacious', 'little', 'tidbit', 'Lommel', 'chose', 'throw', 'very', 'end', 'man', 'obviously', 'shame.Lommel', ""n't"", 'even', 'talented', 'enough', 'be', 'amateur', 'filmmaker', 'opinion', 'Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'disgraceful', 'incompetent', 'film', 'possible', 'way', ""'re"", 'going', 'exploit', 'victims', 'inhuman', 'serial', 'killer', 'profit', 'least', 'show', 'audience', 'little', 'respect']",Ulli Lommel Green River Killer

That movie is much longer, but it was excellent.  It also sparked my interest further in the topic and led me to purchase this movie.  The first few minutes into this movie I lost interest.  The acting is so bad that it seems they hired out-of-work porn actors to do this film.  Actually, the acting was even worse than that.  The ladies in the movie are alot older than the ones I remember reading about associated with the Green River killings.  Although the killer himself has the creepy intensity, it's almost to a point where it reads corny and not believable.  He keeps frequenting this one bar and picking up ladies to murder.  The movie itself lacks that documentary feel where you feel as if you are watching something unfold.  It has more of that ""TV show"" type feel which doesn't help its impact.  I guess I'm pretty big on facts and the portrayal of those facts.  Green River Killer gets a ""D"" on both.  The sexual situations are more skanky than scary.

This director also directed Zodiac Killer, the worst, most god-awful POS ever created.  Now I don't even want to see Green River Killer because it has his name on it.  I'm going to give it a shot, expecting the worst, and then finish this review.Ok, I have just actually finished this movie.  It is not entirely unwatchable, like Zodiac Killer, but is still pretty bad.  If you are a casual movie renter who tends to rent the big blockbusters or the movies that just come out nationwide in theaters, I cannot recommend this to you.  Like someone else said, the film quality looks like an America's Most Wanted reenactment.  The only really grotesque parts of the film that some people would find unwatchable would be the short little flashes of autopsy film, which I believe has nothing to do with the Green River Killer, but is added for shock value.  Other than these snippets of autopsies showing bodies being ripped open and skulls being trephinated after the persons scalp has been peeled off and over their face (which is the worst part of an autopsy to watch, actually), the movie is not that graphic.  One weird aspect of the film is whenever he goes in the same bar to pick up prostitutes, the film plays like a very bad 80's music video with a dancing serial killer.In summary, the film as a whole seems to go nowhere, is often repetitive, is not that fun to watch, but is a little enjoyable with some Evan Williams.

Its only redeeming features are the snippets of actual killer Gary Ridgeway's police interviews that are ocassionally spliced into the film's tawdry, fictionalized action scenes. I hadn't known this footage of Gary Ridgeway existed. A documentary consisting only of these interviews would have been infinitely more interesting than this trumped up movie.The movie doesn't even minimally seem to care about accuracy or authenticity. For example, the extremely amateurish actor who plays Ridgeway doesn't match the real Ridgeway's physical description at all. The real Ridgeway was not a ""tall, handsome, muscular"" fellow. He was shorter, and unassuming-looking. Also, the majority of Ridgeway's victims were not the glamorous, seasoned barroom prostitutes shown here. They were lonely, struggling teenagers whom he picked up along the Seatac Highway.If you want a better insight into the character of Ridgeway's victims and crimes, read Ann Rule's book, ""Green River, Running Red.""

This is one of those movies that would have been better if it was ""inspired"" by actual events instead of being based on them. Gary Ridgway murdered 48 women over a period of 20 years. He dumped the bodies in the same river and picked them up at what appears to be the same bar. He was suspected as being the killer by his associates and he didn't think he would get caught.There is an abundance of first person narration done by Gary (George Kiseleff) to explain his childhood and the killings. Things were done akin to a docu-drama. Gary didn't stab the women, but strangled them, sometimes with his hands and sometimes with his suspenders...which could have made a better film- remember ""Frenzy?"". Gary has a creepy son Kevin (Sebastien Szumilas) and a wife (Naidra Dawn Thomson) that doesn't seem to be all there either. Oh the possibilities of a great film squandered.It is a bad sign when your video producer also plays the bar tender (Nola Roeper). Written, produced, and directed by Ulli Lommel. He was also the detective in the cowboy hat. The movie was also had its share of anachronisms too. Okay, I did like it when he put a cigarette in the dead girls' mouth when he drove her to the river.

952968,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000BYA5H8,Tim Janson,"[11, 14]","The Green River Killer is a remarkable achievement in movie making.  It actually succeeds in making a serial killer seem dull and lifeless.  You know from the opening credits that this is an ultra-cheapo production as the killer, Gary Ridgeway rests by the bank of the Green River (which looks more like a backwoods creek) and mumbles the names of his victims.  Oh look, there's a convenient sign that reads ""Green River"" posted in the ground every time Ridgeway visits it.  Ridgeway is one of America's most notorious serial killers with an admitted body count of four dozen and perhaps more, who eluded capture in the Seattle area for some 20 years.  This film totally sucks the life out of his story with an incompetent cast, horrible dialog, and poor production values in every area.George Kiseleff is the rank amateur in the ""starring role"", and as you can probably guess, it was his first acting credit and hopefully his last.  As Ridgeway he is shown picking up prostitutes at a local tavern and taking them either home or another location to first have sex and then strangle them before dumping their bodies into the Green River.  When Ridgeway is questioned by his wife about the strange woman coming out of their bathroom, and later about the police asking questions, he merely mumbles something incomprehensible and rolls over in bed.  That's pretty much the way he handles police questioning as well...mumbling and looking stupidly nervous until the police leave.  Were the police really that dumb?  If they were as dumb in real life as they were in this film, it's no wonder Ridgeway got away with it for 20 years.  Oh, and if you're going to have women playing prostitutes, do you think you could find one or two who are actually somewhat attractive?  These women are plain ugly.The only positive thing about the film, other than its ending, is the inclusion of scenes of the real Ridgeway during his interrogation by the police.  At least this is the real guy talking about what he did.  I'd have much rather seen a documentary than this mess.  The DVD comes with the director's commentary but I could not bring myself to watch this putrid film a second time.Reviewed by Tim Janson",1,DULLER THAN WATCHING PAINT DRY,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",2006,2196,"['Green', 'River', 'Killer', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'movie', 'making', 'actually', 'making', 'serial', 'killer', 'seem', 'dull', 'lifeless', 'know', 'opening', 'ultra-cheapo', 'production', 'killer', 'Gary', 'Ridgeway', 'rests', 'bank', 'Green', 'River', 'more', 'backwoods', 'creek', 'names', 'victims', 'Oh', 'look', 'convenient', 'sign', 'Green', 'River', 'posted', 'ground', 'time', 'Ridgeway', 'Ridgeway', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'notorious', 'serial', 'killers', 'admitted', 'body', 'count', 'four', 'dozen', 'perhaps', 'more', 'who', 'eluded', 'capture', 'Seattle', 'area', '20', 'years', 'film', 'totally', 'life', 'story', 'incompetent', 'cast', 'horrible', 'dialog', 'poor', 'production', 'values', 'area.George', 'Kiseleff', 'rank', 'amateur', 'starring', 'role', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'was', 'first', 'acting', 'credit', 'hopefully', 'last', 'Ridgeway', 'shown', 'picking', 'up', 'prostitutes', 'local', 'tavern', 'taking', 'home', 'location', 'first', 'have', 'sex', 'then', 'strangle', 'dumping', 'bodies', 'Green', 'River', 'When', 'Ridgeway', 'questioned', 'wife', 'strange', 'woman', 'coming', 'bathroom', 'later', 'police', 'asking', 'questions', 'merely', 'something', 'incomprehensible', 'rolls', 'bed', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', 'police', 'questioning', 'as', 'well', 'mumbling', 'looking', 'stupidly', 'nervous', 'police', 'leave', 'Were', 'police', 'really', 'dumb', 'were', 'dumb', 'real', 'life', 'were', 'film', 'wonder', 'Ridgeway', 'got', 'away', '20', 'years', 'Oh', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'women', 'playing', 'prostitutes', 'do', 'think', 'could', 'find', 'one', 'two', 'who', 'are', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'attractive', 'women', 'are', 'plain', 'ugly.The', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'film', 'other', 'ending', 'inclusion', 'scenes', 'real', 'Ridgeway', 'interrogation', 'police', 'least', 'real', 'guy', 'talking', 'what', 'did', ""'d"", 'have', 'much', 'rather', 'seen', 'documentary', 'mess', 'DVD', 'director', 'commentary', 'could', 'not', 'bring', 'watch', 'putrid', 'film', 'second', 'time.Reviewed', 'Tim', 'Janson']",Ulli Lommel Green River Killer
