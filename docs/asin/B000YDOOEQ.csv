1119064,A2NC9G399V3UF0,B000YDOOEQ,,"[2, 5]","Dragon WarsJapan does not have the market cornered on legendary creatures. Sure, they have Godzilla and his horde of monstrous companions Mothra and family. But, dragons, while oriental, are not specifially Japanese. That was the starting point for writer/director Hyung Rae Shim and executive producer Woo Taek Kim.""We set out to make a film that had universal appeal"" they commented in the special features. ""And to do that, we had to make our Korean film as universally acceptable as possible. We set the film in locations from New York to Los Angeles, and recruited world class musicians (Dies Iraes) and sound effects specialists.""The result is an outstanding film that examines the legend of Buraki and the good Imoogi. Buraki is a 200 meter dragon/snake/serpent that can only be defeated by the Imoogi and the Yuh Yi Joo, a re-incarnated 500 year old beauty. An American reporter Ethan and his 'beloved' Sarah run from the mythical monsters through crowded city scapes while a mystical battle is being fought.With any film that deals with a 'legend', North american audiences have a tough time thinking past the obvious. Our lives are spent without a thought for the other worldly battles that rage above us, or have raged in ages past. Such is this film. The ambitious film by first time director is not a $200 m Peter Jackson production, but rather a project seething with dedication finished for a small fraction of a Jackson film.Sure, it does have deficiencies, but what do you expect when your main characters are CGI, and the FBI/CIA are battling mythical monsters with handguns. This film is the Orient meets the Americas. Mysticism meets the mafia. Legend meets the law keepers. It is exactly what you might expect in such a 'real' confrontation.The special features tell the story of the film, from concept to final production with commentary by comedian turned director. Unlike many monster films, this has a remarkable story behind the production. Younggu Art Studios is going to be a first class facility in the near future.Production wise, it is very professional. First class CGI, audio tracks, and modelling. It beats any Godzilla film fins down.

1119065,A34FEX6IPQL95G,B000YDOOEQ,,"[2, 5]","When it comes to giant monster B movies--like Godzilla for example--Japan is the first name that comes to mind but look out; Korea could be the new kid on the block. They rank in at number 10 in the overall movie market in the world--according to the Korean Film council. The Host (17.2 million dollars [budget at 11 million]) and now the ""smash hit"" D-Wars (54 million [budget between 30 and 70 million]) are the latest from the Far East. However, the movie The Host swept Korea's Blue Dragon Awards in 2006 and was considered one of the best Foreign films of 2006, but unfortunately D-Wars will probably be viewed as one of the worst movies for 2007, especially for us here in America. The poor direction by unknown Shim Hyung-rae, the confusing story, the emotionless/wooden acting and the sloppy editing are the sad focal points. All those factors destroy any possibility for the graphics to entertain (the battle sequence in LA and the final dragon fight at end of the movie). The CGI was created by Shim's Younggu-Art Movie Company. Godzilla from Toho studios, where are you? We need you back now.A CGNN television news reporter by the name of Ethan (Jason Behr) is covering his latest story in an open field in Los Angeles: where major destruction has occurred. Within moments, he notices that the police are dusting off a huge green substance; he knows that it is the scale of the legendary Korean Beast known as Imugi; a mythical dragon creature. In a short while, he returns to the news studios but has a flash back of when he was a young boy and his encounter that he had with a mystical storekeeper named Jack (Robert Forster [Ancient Warlord/Sensei]).He learns that he is the reincarnated spirit of an ancient Korean warrior-apprentice named Haram--learning the martial arts skills by the Warlord/Sensei--who has to defend Princess ""Tattoo"" Narin from all her enemies. He falls in love with her. However, his Sensei could care less because the Princess--who is now 20 years old--needs to give up her special life force to the Imugi, by scarification. They--either the good, or bad Imugi--will ascend to Dragon hood through ingestion.Within a short while, a crisis develops in this Kingdom. The evil General as well as his Power Rangers/Storm Troopers, and most importantly the evil giant serpent arrive first and a great battle ensues. There is no escape for the couple, therefore they decide to jump off a cliff. Through their failure, their reincarnated spirits will repeat this event again in 500 years to battle the bad imugi, the evil general and his evil army.It is present day again and now Ethan must find a girl named Sara Daniels (Amanda Brooks) with a tattoo marking of the good Imug (she is the Princess). However, this will be difficult because there are many girls at this age that fit this description. He uses the help of a co-worker to search through the computer database to help narrow his search but he eventually is able to locate her at a hospital. What will be the out come of Ethan and Sarah? Will they defeat these forces of evil?Confused about the story? Trust us, don't even sweat it.When seeing the preview for D-Wars I had a flashback of Destroy All Monsters, as other movies such as King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962) and All Monsters Attack (1969) that the Toho Company Ltd. released. As a kid these monsters were everything, even though they were just a bunch a people in rubber suits, there was artistry.In D-Wars you can definitely see the theme of such American Science Fiction movies as The Terminator series (1984-2003) with dialog similarities between the main characters, and even the similar cinematography from King Kong (1976) and the American Godzilla (1998). Is the director paying homage to these movies or to Korean Nationalism because at the end of the film we see Shim use Korean print and Shim quotes ""D-War and I will succeed in the world market without fail?"" Keep dreaming.We will tell you from our point of view that you cannot impress us or the world market. Especially from the American actor Robert Forster who gives us a mono log in the flash back in which he sounds like an ESL instructor, teaching a class of foreigners. The romantic chemistry that never develops from our lovers--Ethan and Sara--because they seem hopelessly confused if they even want to know each other. Should they not be able to recognize their reincarnated spirits? Where is Ethan's ability of the marital arts or even superhuman strength, he is a reincarnated warrior? He just keeps running away. Then there is the evil General along with the Atrox soilders who give us the impression of evil Power Rangers/Storm troopers from Star Wars. The General spoke and sounded like Mr. Bean. That's being funny unintentionally.For the new generation of Asians filmmakers, people wearing rubber suit and city miniatures are something from the past. For Better or for worse, they upgraded themselves to the new computer graphics extravaganza of today. Honestly we liked the classic monster films from that period. But not everything is lost in D-Wars, one of the best moments in the film is the dragon invasion of the city where we get to see some decent monster action against the military--the creatures look pretty decent at times and really terrible at others--but the action itself is quite interesting. Let's not forget the final battle between the two dragons. The loud dragons face off and goes on for a while, but it has very little realism, but quite intense nevertheless.Proceed with caution because if you're a fan of the B Japanese monster movies, you will be disappointed with the cheesiness of this ""upgraded"" Asian monster film. Where is the fun of the classic monsters from the past? Just because you have computer graphics, it doesn't mean that you're going to make a great film. despite some decent battle moments; the film is flat because of the hilarious acting, confusing plot and video-game special effects.

1119066,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000YDOOEQ,,"[2, 6]","I don't like writing bad reviews. Usually, if I don't like something, I'll simply move on. But this movie is terrible. It is, at best, a test of your own personal patience. If you can watch the entire thing without interruption, then chances are you are one of the most patient living humans on the face of this earth. D-Wars is, from start to finish, a series of melodramatic moments highlighted here and there by Power Rangers-esque special effects. If you want that kind of entertainment, then I'd check out Xena: Warrior Princess. At least that doesn't try to take itself too serious.What D-Wars is attempting to be is an action-packed disaster movie based on Korean mythology. It follows the story of how a good snake can become a heavenly dragon, and how an evil snake will stop at nothing to steal that gift away from the good one. But this gift comes from a twenty-year-old human girl with a red-dragon tattoo. And I think that's all that I need to say. The story is contrived, forced, and put together in the most cliche way. Highlights include: a bad guy conveniently stepping into place to be hit by a car so that the protagonists can escape capture; a chanting bad guy who just sounds ridiculous; a series of happenstances in which the hero suddenly gets the answer to his problem without any real work; and finally a sad unbalance of emotional content (meaning that one moment they're invoking laughs, the next they're deadly serious, ruining whatever momentum the story may have been building).So, if there is one thing that should be noted before you purchase, it's this: you'll be wasting your money.

Dragon Wars was absolutely crammed with potential and the opportunities to make a cool film about dragons fighting and destroying stuff is unlimited in scope. But somehow, someway, the makers behind Dragon Wars found the perfect way to ruin a cool idea and waste every ounce of its potential.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: 500 years ago in Korea, a young girl was supposed to be taken by an Imoogi (A serpent-like creature) and when her village is attacked, she and a young warrior run off and commit suicide to escape the evil Buraki who is an evil Imoogi and his army. Shoot forward 500 years later and we are introduced to a guy named Ethan who is the chosen one because he is the reincarnated warrior at the beginning of the film and we are also introduced to Sarah who is the reincarnated girl supposed to be given to the Imoogi centuries ago. Now Ethan must rescue Sarah and prevent her from being taken from Buraki and his army. From then on, this film has one of the most incompetent, jumbled, inconsistent and ridiculously bad plots I've ever tried to interpret and it made no sense and was laughably bad from start to finish.MUSIC: This was one of the only parts of the film that didn't suck. It was well-composed and it was enjoyable to listen to. Too bad it was wasted for this crappy film.ACTION: Even with the terrible plot, the filmmakers could have still made some really cool action scenes, but even then they still messed it up and offers virtually no cool action moments throughout. There are a few mentionable scenes, but as a whole the action scenes were in no way spectacular as they should have been.ACTING: Oh boy, let's not get started. All of the actors were awful and in a bad way to the point of where I couldn't even get a B-movie enjoyment out of the film. Oh, and on top of their bad acting, let's not forget the terrible dialogue which can't be taken seriously at any point in the film.OVERALL: Skip it. This film was bad, and a very painful failure seeing such a cool idea go to waste. I tried so hard to like this film, and every time I came close they threw another crappy moment. Worse yet, one of the studios that helped make this film; Showbox; is one of the studios that helped make The Host (A much better monster flick by the way), and I really enjoyed The Host.

The biggest problem with this film, and there are many problems with this film, is that it seems to be edited by someone using all the finesse of Freddie Kruger slashing up a screaming teenager.  Scene changes are frequently abrupt, and flip to unrelated, often confusing, acts.  The film's prologue is too long, and often snooze-worthy.  I can suspend my disbelief long enough to allow for a gi-normous snake to rampage around a city, looking for someone.  I can't suspend my disbelief long enough to allow for virtually no one interrupting their day-to-day lives while a huge snake tears up their city.  In the world of Dragon Wars, apparently no one ever heard of the concept of ""evacuation"".  Hang out; dodge pieces of building torn loose by the big snake; grab a cappuccino; and go on with your day.  The hero was tiresome; the military and FBI were portrayed as incompetent; and the whole situation was tiresome.  I found myself rooting for the big, bad, snake to take them all out, and end the misery that is this film.  The best part was the end of the film.  One reason: the film was over!  Another reason being the final scene was actually well done, with a great CG fight scene between two CG snaky-dragons.

If you happen to enjoy a mix of kids movies, old Chinese Kung Fu movies, fantasy, monster movies, and some comedy (the fat guy trying to tell people about what he saw is especially funny) you will get more out of this movie. I think unfortunately too many critics took it far to seriously. The story is about a young boy that has the power to reveal the contents of an ancient box and gains the trust of an old wizard who tells him a story of another time. As the story unfolds a reporter is trying to find out about some odd ocurrences taking place in Los Angeles. Although it jumps between the current and ancient it actually is interesting if you sit back and just soak it in without being judgemental. If Shim claimed it did not have any comedy in it I would disagree, but if he said it was not a comedy I understand, because it isn't a comedy. The amount of criticism is ridiculous because it breaks the mold of overly dramatic blockbusters.

1119082,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000YDOOEQ,Chris Pandolfi,"[34, 47]","Here's a piece of advice: if you have a movie called ""Dragon Wars,"" it's probably not a good idea to save the dragon footage for the last five minutes. The rest of the film does showcase a number of other creatures, such as winged dinosaur-hybrids and things that vaguely resemble rhinos. We even get to see gigantic snakes that have the potential to become dragons. But where are the actual dragons? Why keep us waiting until the end? This is but one example of how hopelessly incompetent this film is; ""Dragon Wars""--or ""D-War,"" or whatever it's called--is an attempt but not an actual end result, an absolute mess filled with unconvincing special effects, horrendous performances, and a plot I neither understood nor cared about.The film opens with a Los Angeles news reporter named Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr) trying to get the latest scoop on an explosion. Not much is known about what happened; all anyone can determine is that a gigantic, odd-looking animal scale is found under the soil. From what animal, no one knows. But whatever it comes from, seeing it triggers a number of flashback sequences, the first of which takes place fifteen years ago, when Ethan was only a boy. He and his father enter a local antique shop and meet Jack (Robert Forester), the elusive owner. He notices a strange sight; as Ethan approaches a wooden chest, it opens and reveals a brilliant white light. This signals to Jack that Ethan a destined young boy.With me so far? Because it only gets worse from here. After sending the father away (by faking a heart attack and begging for help), Jack tells Ethan of an ancient myth that dates back to sixteenth-century Korea. Apparently, titanic serpents called Inoogi are destined to become dragons. For its good deeds, an Inoogi is rewarded--it joins with the soul of a Yuh Yi Joo, after which it ascends to heaven. A Yuh Yi Joo, by the way, is a special girl born once every 500 years--she's recognizable because she has a red dragon tattooed on her left shoulder. Anyway, evil serpents called Buraki have always tried to stop Inoogi from ascending, and they use their minions to find the Yuh Yi Joo and destroy her. Such was the destiny of a young Korean girl back in the 1500s; she fell in love with the guard sworn to protect her, meaning she failed to meet with her destiny. Both the Inoogi and the Buraki remain roaming the earth, waiting for the next Yuh Yi Joo to be born.I apologize for rambling, but I'm trying to make sense of this story. There's no reason why a ninety-minute film has to have this much crammed into it, especially since none of it is of any interest. If they wanted an escapist film, then they should have made an escapist film; forget the complex details and just give us something entertaining. You'd think that such a convoluted back-story would add a little something, but no, it doesn't. If there's a point to this film, then I have no idea what it is.But back to the plot. As a boy, Ethan was told that the next Yuh Yi Joo will be a girl named Sarah, and at age twenty, she'll be old enough to converge with the Inoogi. He was also told that he must find and protect her, no matter what. He's then given a special talisman (what makes it special is anyone's guess). Now as an adult, Ethan uses his reporter's skills to track Sarah down; by ""reporter's skills,"" I mean he has his monotone assistant, Bruce (Craig Robinson), do the work for him. This is when we finally meet Sarah (Amanda Brooks), a pretty young girl who was born with a red dragon tattooed on her left shoulder. After seeing news footage of Ethan at the explosion site, she begins to feel funny, as if she knows something terrible is going to happen. Of course, no one believes her, and she soon finds herself locked in a psychiatric ward.The Buraki, meanwhile, is loose and hot on her trail. I don't bother questioning how it manages to find her, but I do wonder how an 800-foot long snake can go unnoticed until it attacks. How can something so large slither around buildings, over rooftops, and through streets without making even the tiniest noise? Never mind--the point is that it's after Sarah, and Ethan has to protect her from it. Through a series of laughably preposterous circumstances, they find each other and escape from the hospital. After battling the Buraki atop the Federal Building in Downtown Los Angeles, they witness the climactic fight between the Buraki and the Inoogi.The FBI gets involved about halfway through the film, and at that point, my interest had completely faded. For reasons never adequately explained, they know everything about the dragons and Sarah. They also think that killing Sarah is the only solution to the problem. I wanted to tell these people that another problem exists, one that's even bigger than feuding dragons. The movie itself is the problem; ""Dragon Wars"" is mind-numbingly bad, the kind of bad that wouldn't even give rise to a cult classic. I wasn't expecting great cinematic art, but at the very least, the filmmakers could have tried to make a fun movie. After all, I just wanted to see some dragons.

But if your looking just to be entertained, well its  a 2 inch pool of water that spans over a mile wide.So if your looking for a lot of great effects..and action, and dinosaur's chomping on people, and small flying dragons taking down apache helicopters and vise versa.. well this is the movie for you!Because it has all of this.One of the things I liked in this movie, is the fact, that the soldiers and the dinosaurs/creatures/dragons..serpents, are not invincible.

1119084,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000YDOOEQ,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 4]","When I see such things as a litany of hilarious ""things I learned from watching Dragon Wars"" and complaints that there is really only one dragon and he appears only at the very end, it does make this film seem pretty stupid - but despite all of the oddities, gaps, and other problems with the plot, I had a ball watching it.  Maybe it's just the fact that I've tried very hard to never let the kid in me fade away, but dude, there's destruction on the level of a good Japanese Godzilla movie, the CGI effects are a wonder to behold, and I don't know where else you will ever find gigantic sloths with missile launchers on their backs in the year 1507.  It also doesn't hurt that the lead actress is pretty darn hot.Admittedly, the backstory is incredibly long, complicated, and foreign (as in Korean legend), but let me break it down for you.  Let's start with Imoogis, giant serpents who lived in the heavens long ago.  Every five hundred years, one good Imoogi is rewarded for its good deeds by receiving the Yuh Yi Joo, which allows him to become a celestial dragon.  Among these Imoogis was an evil one named Baruki, who lusted for the Yuh Yi Joo.  To keep him from getting it, the Yuh Yi Joo was hidden on Earth - but it wasn't hidden very well, as Baruki knew it would be borne inside the body of a twenty-year-old woman who was born with the image of a red dragon on her shoulder.  An old warrior and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; are sent to safeguard the Yuh Yi Joo and make sure the girl is sacrificed to the good Imoogi once her twentieth birthday comes.  Last time, back in 1507, there was a problem, as the young warrior fell in love with the girl.  To cut a long story short, both the good Imoogi and Baruki were forced to wait another five centuries for a chance to ascend into the heavens.In 2007, the Yuh Yi Joo resides in the body of Sarah Daniels (Amanda Brooks), and a TV reporter named Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr) comes to realize that he is the reincarnated young warrior destined to protect her.  He has to find her first, which isn't easy given the fact that Baruki and his hordes of servants set out tearing Los Angeles apart to find her first.  Will Ethan be able to save her from Baruki?  Will he seek to change their fate once again or deliver her to the good Imoogi?Director Shim Hyung-rae reportedly spent several years trying to make this film a reality, so all of the criticisms of the plot are more than valid.  One would think, for example, that even the most star-struck of L.A. residents and tourists would actually notice a giant serpent tearing its way through the city.  You also have to wonder why the FBI would so readily accept the ""ancient legend"" explanation of the monster - or how they figured out so quickly that the serpent was looking for Sarah Daniels.  The list goes on and on.  Having enjoyed the film so much, though, I just think all of these things are funny.  In fact, they almost make me want to watch the film again to see what other goofs I can find.  I'm sure the epic scale of the action and the incredible special effects wouldn't diminish very much on a second viewing, either.  I really don't understand how so many people can label Dragon Wars one of the worst movies ever made - they obviously haven't seen a lot of the obscure B-movies I've suffered through.",4,"The film definitely has some flaws, but I loved it anyway",1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,3321,"['When', 'see', 'such', 'things', 'litany', 'hilarious', 'things', 'learned', 'watching', 'Dragon', 'Wars', 'complaints', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'dragon', 'only', 'very', 'end', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'oddities', 'gaps', 'other', 'problems', 'plot', 'had', 'ball', 'watching', 'Maybe', 'just', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'very', 'hard', 'never', 'let', 'kid', 'fade', 'away', 'dude', 'destruction', 'level', 'good', 'Japanese', 'Godzilla', 'movie', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'wonder', 'behold', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'else', 'will', 'ever', 'find', 'gigantic', 'sloths', 'missile', 'launchers', 'backs', 'year', '1507', 'also', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'lead', 'actress', 'pretty', 'darn', 'hot.Admittedly', 'backstory', 'incredibly', 'long', 'complicated', 'foreign', 'Korean', 'legend', 'let', 'break', 'down', 'Let', 'start', 'Imoogis', 'giant', 'serpents', 'who', 'lived', 'heavens', 'long', 'ago', 'Every', 'five', 'hundred', 'years', 'one', 'good', 'Imoogi', 'rewarded', 'good', 'deeds', 'receiving', 'Yuh', 'Yi', 'Joo', 'become', 'celestial', 'dragon', 'Imoogis', 'was', 'evil', 'one', 'named', 'Baruki', 'who', 'lusted', 'Yuh', 'Yi', 'Joo', 'keep', 'getting', 'Yuh', 'Yi', 'Joo', 'was', 'hidden', 'Earth', 'was', ""n't"", 'hidden', 'very', 'well', 'Baruki', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'borne', 'body', 'twenty-year-old', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'image', 'red', 'dragon', 'shoulder', 'old', 'warrior', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'are', 'sent', 'safeguard', 'Yuh', 'Yi', 'Joo', 'make', 'sure', 'girl', 'sacrificed', 'good', 'Imoogi', 'once', 'twentieth', 'birthday', 'Last', 'time', 'back', '1507', 'was', 'problem', 'young', 'warrior', 'fell', 'love', 'girl', 'cut', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'good', 'Imoogi', 'Baruki', 'were', 'forced', 'wait', 'five', 'centuries', 'chance', 'ascend', 'heavens.In', '2007', 'Yuh', 'Yi', 'Joo', 'body', 'Sarah', 'Daniels', 'Amanda', 'Brooks', 'TV', 'reporter', 'named', 'Ethan', 'Kendrick', 'Jason', 'Behr', 'realize', 'reincarnated', 'young', 'warrior', 'destined', 'protect', 'find', 'first', ""n't"", 'easy', 'given', 'fact', 'Baruki', 'hordes', 'servants', 'set', 'out', 'tearing', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'apart', 'find', 'first', 'Will', 'Ethan', 'be', 'able', 'save', 'Baruki', 'Will', 'seek', 'change', 'fate', 'once', 'again', 'deliver', 'good', 'Imoogi', 'Director', 'Shim', 'Hyung-rae', 'reportedly', 'spent', 'several', 'years', 'trying', 'make', 'film', 'reality', 'criticisms', 'plot', 'are', 'more', 'valid', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'example', 'even', 'most', 'star-struck', 'L.A.', 'residents', 'tourists', 'would', 'actually', 'notice', 'giant', 'serpent', 'tearing', 'way', 'city', 'also', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'FBI', 'would', 'so', 'readily', 'accept', 'ancient', 'legend', 'explanation', 'monster', 'how', 'figured', 'out', 'so', 'quickly', 'serpent', 'was', 'looking', 'Sarah', 'Daniels', 'list', 'Having', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'think', 'things', 'are', 'funny', 'fact', 'almost', 'make', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'see', 'what', 'other', 'goofs', 'can', 'find', ""'m"", 'sure', 'epic', 'scale', 'action', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'would', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'very', 'much', 'second', 'viewing', 'either', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'label', 'Dragon', 'Wars', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'obviously', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lot', 'obscure', 'B-movies', ""'ve"", 'suffered']",Dragon Wars - D-War
1119085,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B000YDOOEQ,Daryl B,"[0, 0]","When I saw the preview for this movie, I was looking forward to seeing the film.  The whole premise was interesting and, to be honest, a lot of countries other than the U. S. have been making some original and interesting movies (such as Japan and their horror movies).  This film is a dud, unfortunately.The story revolves around dragon folklore in ancient Korea, where two mystical dragons await the arrival of a special young woman's twentieth birthday.  At this time, the young woman, who has been born for the sole purpose of giving either the good or bad creatures the ability to become powerful celestial dragons, falls for the young man who is trained to protect her and see that she completes her destiny.  The two lovers run from their fate and die before she can bestow the special gift from heaven on either creature.Now, in present day, both are reincarnated, along with their old mentor, to finish the task that was their lot in life.  All this sounds pretty good but the entire movie falls so short of its promise.  The acting by all of the cast is weak, as though none of them cared anything about the story.  The editing was very sloppy and the horrible dialogue is, at times, cringe inducing!  The reason I gave two stars to this train wreck of a film is the special effects.  The dragons and other mythical creatures are incredibly well done and a pleasure to watch.  This is the one reason to see this film.

Consider that in the first exposition scenes you have not one, but 2 entirely different characters in different scenes say directly to the narrator in the middle of his attempted explanation of this nonsensical tale ""what are you talking about?"" I don't believe this was accidental folks, this is called comedy.One thing to be aware of when you're watching this movie is that the director is the most popular comedian in the entire country of Korea. He gained his fame and fortune as comedic actor. In other words his entire professional career has been based on making people laugh.I think most people who are reviewing this movie are completely missing the comedy.  Frankly I found the movie to be hilarious.How anyone could possibly take this movie seriously after seeing the Darth Vader character stupidly get run over by a car 2 times in a row is beyond me. That was obviously comedy (and very funny).Yes it is entirely overblown.  Layers of complete absurdity are piled with additional layers of even more absurdity. Which makes it a perfect satire of the Star Wars, Lord of the rings, Harry Potter and all of the rest of the overly pompous mega-movies.  If there is a big overblown scene in one of those movies you're going to see a similar scene in this one.A few examples.  The Gungan Army scene from Star Wars episode 4 -- only this time the Army with the cute, smiling dinosaur critters with the weapons on their backs are the bad guys.  And these smiling dinosaurs are wreaking total havoc on Los Angeles fighting the LAPD. The incongruity of the destruction and the cute smiley dinosaurs is absolutely hilarious.Remember the giant explosion scene in Independence Day with the flames and flying cars rushing up the street? It's here, but with a very funny twist.  In this movie the same thing is done by a giant snake rushing up the street.  The exorcism scene in the Exorcist?  Yep, it's here too, tossed in like the kitchen sink, completely unconnected to any plot points.Giant marching Imperial Army and Ninjas?  Sure enough.  Darth Vader character with a ridiculously laughable sinister voice?  Of course. Rampaging Jurassic Park dinosaurs?  You got it.  Dogfights straight out of Independence Day?  It's here too.Savor the site of Ray Harryhausen look-alike creatures doing massive destruction that Ray most certainly dreamed of, but couldn't accomplish with the technology of his day. I can tell you that he is smiling in his grave cause this movie delivers a wonderful tribute to his work.Let me name a few more of the movies that have tributes here.  Pitch Black, King Kong, Seventh Voyage of Sinbad, Men in Black, Dragonheart, Ghostbusters, Godzilla, Ninja Mutant Turtles, the Host, The Thing, Rodan and even Monty Python and the holy Grail. It doesn't stop there, look carefully and you'll see many many more.Does the acting suck?  Absolutely. Is the story completely incomprehensible?  It most certainly is.  Is it even more ridiculous than Star Wars, Lord of the rings or dozens of others.  Yes it is, and I believe that was exactly the point.I predict this movie will be watched at midnight showings at colleges 10 years from now with folks rolling in the aisles.I have seen lots of Hollywood studio comedies recently and have not laughed nearly as hard as I did watching Dragon wars.  I literally had tears streaming from my eyes many times because I couldn't stop laughing.So give yourself a break from any pretensions of seriousness, have a glass of wine and have a fun time watching and laughing at the funniest, most ridiculous spectacular eye candy CGI movie ever.",5,Brilliant Satire or Monumental Disaster?,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,3748,"['am', '56-year-old', 'movie', 'buff', 'right', 'off', 'let', 'confess', 'love', 'movie.In', 'opinion', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Consider', 'first', 'exposition', 'scenes', 'have', 'not', 'one', '2', 'entirely', 'different', 'characters', 'different', 'scenes', 'say', 'directly', 'narrator', 'middle', 'attempted', 'explanation', 'nonsensical', 'tale', 'what', 'are', 'talking', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'accidental', 'folks', 'called', 'comedy.One', 'thing', 'be', 'aware', 'when', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'director', 'most', 'popular', 'comedian', 'entire', 'country', 'Korea', 'gained', 'fame', 'fortune', 'comedic', 'actor', 'other', 'words', 'entire', 'professional', 'career', 'been', 'based', 'making', 'people', 'laugh.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'reviewing', 'movie', 'are', 'completely', 'missing', 'comedy', 'Frankly', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'hilarious.How', 'anyone', 'could', 'possibly', 'take', 'movie', 'seriously', 'seeing', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'character', 'stupidly', 'get', 'run', 'over', 'car', '2', 'times', 'row', 'was', 'obviously', 'comedy', 'very', 'funny', '.Yes', 'entirely', 'overblown', 'Layers', 'complete', 'absurdity', 'are', 'piled', 'additional', 'layers', 'even', 'more', 'absurdity', 'perfect', 'satire', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Lord', 'rings', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'rest', 'overly', 'pompous', 'mega-movies', 'big', 'overblown', 'scene', 'one', 'movies', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'similar', 'scene', 'one.A', 'few', 'examples', 'Gungan', 'Army', 'scene', 'Star', 'Wars', 'episode', '4', 'only', 'time', 'Army', 'cute', 'smiling', 'dinosaur', 'critters', 'weapons', 'backs', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'smiling', 'dinosaurs', 'are', 'wreaking', 'total', 'havoc', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'fighting', 'LAPD', 'incongruity', 'destruction', 'cute', 'smiley', 'dinosaurs', 'absolutely', 'hilarious.Remember', 'giant', 'explosion', 'scene', 'Independence', 'Day', 'flames', 'flying', 'cars', 'rushing', 'up', 'street', 'here', 'very', 'funny', 'twist', 'movie', 'same', 'thing', 'done', 'giant', 'snake', 'rushing', 'up', 'street', 'exorcism', 'scene', 'Exorcist', 'Yep', 'here', 'too', 'tossed', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'completely', 'unconnected', 'plot', 'points.Giant', 'marching', 'Imperial', 'Army', 'Ninjas', 'Sure', 'enough', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'character', 'ridiculously', 'laughable', 'sinister', 'voice', 'course', 'Rampaging', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'dinosaurs', 'got', 'Dogfights', 'straight', 'Independence', 'Day', 'here', 'site', 'Ray', 'Harryhausen', 'look-alike', 'creatures', 'doing', 'massive', 'destruction', 'Ray', 'most', 'certainly', 'dreamed', 'could', ""n't"", 'accomplish', 'technology', 'day', 'can', 'tell', 'smiling', 'grave', 'cause', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'tribute', 'work.Let', 'few', 'more', 'movies', 'have', 'tributes', 'here', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'King', 'Kong', 'Seventh', 'Voyage', 'Sinbad', 'Men', 'Black', 'Dragonheart', 'Ghostbusters', 'Godzilla', 'Ninja', 'Mutant', 'Turtles', 'Host', 'Thing', 'Rodan', 'even', 'Monty', 'Python', 'holy', 'Grail', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'look', 'carefully', ""'ll"", 'see', 'many', 'many', 'more.Does', 'acting', 'suck', 'Absolutely', 'story', 'completely', 'incomprehensible', 'most', 'certainly', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Lord', 'rings', 'dozens', 'others', 'Yes', 'believe', 'was', 'exactly', 'point.I', 'predict', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'watched', 'midnight', 'showings', 'colleges', '10', 'years', 'now', 'folks', 'rolling', 'aisles.I', 'have', 'seen', 'lots', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'comedies', 'recently', 'have', 'not', 'laughed', 'nearly', 'as', 'hard', 'did', 'watching', 'Dragon', 'wars', 'literally', 'had', 'tears', 'streaming', 'eyes', 'many', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'laughing.So', 'give', 'break', 'pretensions', 'seriousness', 'have', 'glass', 'wine', 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'watching', 'laughing', 'funniest', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'spectacular', 'eye', 'candy', 'CGI', 'movie', 'ever']",Dragon Wars - D-War
1119090,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B000YDOOEQ,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","I think it's a bit of a stretch to call this movie a comedy.  Yes, there are strained attempts at humor that fall flat, but that in itself is not enough to suppose the whole wreck can be excused away as a well-meaning chuckle.  I think the filmmakers fully intended to make an action/fantasy film that was meant to be taken seriously.  The results though, are quite another matter.  This movie is literally all over the place, complete with a false start, a trek back in time, reincarnation, and prehistoric creatures galore.  Precious little of this makes any sense.  It doesn't help that confusion appears to be part of the filmmaker's strategy.  Scenes are purposely kept brief, barely taking the time to establish what is going on before jumping across town or skipping merrily from one day to the next in the blink of an eye.  There are even several faux scenes that turn out to be mere dreams.  Good grief, the main character goes from a boy with blue eyes to an adult with brown eyes in a close-up no less!  A lot of this movie is just weird.  One minute it's like something out of Star Wars, then it borrows from Godzilla, it even has a berserk killer fed (Chris Mulkey)!  I think gratuitous best explains the direction this film takes.  It's outrageous, nonsensical, and oddly short at only 90 minutes.  And yet, for all its shortcomings, or because of them, I actually liked this movie.  I'm still trying to figure out how or why I do, I just do.

1119091,A5BOJX3CM4XV4,B000YDOOEQ,"Emmit W. Stewart ""movie fan""","[3, 4]","I think that most reviewers seem to be missing the point that a new form of cinematic art has been coming into existence in the last forty years. It can best described as the Heroic Fantasy Epic.  Of course, it has been around in literature for a long time, but only in the last forty years have movie makers begun developing the tools to produce the effects needed to bring these stories to life.  It requires believable creatures that cannot possibly be represented by human actors or animals in costume and makeup.  It requires a beleivable representation of magic on a huge scale.  And, it requires an audience that is willing to accept that the ""real"" physical world we see around us is not the only possible world, and that it is possible for an intelligent, imaginative person to create  a fictional world where some of the laws of science as we know it do not necessarily apply.This is such a movie.  It is complete fantasy and, as such, many of the rules of logic that govern other genres do not apply.  It is not necessary that the character of the Hero be fully developed.  It is sufficient that his intentions are Good and that he is brave and reasonably likeable.  Of course, it is much better if he is a fully rounded character and that his feelings be well expressed, but he is really a symbol for the forces of Goodness and, therefore need not be too carefully drawn.  Likewise, The villain is only a symbol for the forces of Evil, so he can be even less well defined.  In the same vein, the Deus Ex Machina is a perfectly acceptable device to bring about the destruction of the forces of Evil, since it is a major belief in almost every major religion that a human being alone is not capable resisting true Evil and that faith in, or the grace of, some deity is absolutely needed to overcome that Evil.In essence the plot of an Epic fantasy is basically a form of melodrama.  First, the Hero is introduced, along with the Heroine and the rest of the Good people.  Then the Villain enters, usually disguised (thinly) as a good person. The Villain then gathers his henchmen secretly while gaining the confidence of the good people and tricking them into doing things that will later put them completely in his power.  The Hero usually suspects the Villain but he is not believed until it is too late and the Villain has sprung his trap.  When the trap is sprung, the good people try to resist, but to no avail, the villain has them trapped and helpless.  Meanwhile, the Hero perseveres and eventually finds the Villains weakness.  He confronts the villain and foils his plan, but the villain has foreseen this and responds with brute force. The good people dispair, but the Deus Ex Machina intervenes and the Villain is driven off. the good people celebrate.  Not every Fantasy follows this plot exactly, but in almost every case the Villain menaces, The Hero resists, and Goodness wins in the end, no matter how dark the outcome appears to be at the end of the next-to-last scene.This movie is a fantasy epic.  If you follow the directors comments in the special features, you will know that it was built around some of the best special effects and CIG work I have ever seen. Once once he had that, the director took them and his script to Hollywood and recruited actors, sound designers, and a composer. The characters are not well developed because the movie is so packed with action that there is no time to waste on expressing the feelings or opinions of the cast.  There is no time to show the developing love story of the hero and heroine, so the narrator simply tells you that they fell in love and they then react to the events as a person in love would.I loved this movie.  Yes, it has some flaws, but they are overshadowed by the hard work and effort that the makers put out to bring it forth. If you examine all the great classic movies of all time, they all had their flaws.  But what made them great was that they grabbed your attention and kept you watching in spite of it. This movie does just that. You are swept from one action to the next without a pause for breathe.  You don't miss the love scenes because you know that If the charactors had stopped moving long to make love, they would have been killed or eaten.  In the final analysis, this is a well-crafted action adventure filled with exceptinally good special effects and backed with an excellent musical score.  The sound effects are just as good as the outstanding visual effects.  Ignore the critics, sit back and enjoy the story and you'll have a good time.",5,a new force in fantasy,1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,4553,"['think', 'most', 'reviewers', 'seem', 'be', 'missing', 'point', 'new', 'form', 'cinematic', 'art', 'been', 'coming', 'existence', 'last', 'forty', 'years', 'can', 'best', 'described', 'Heroic', 'Fantasy', 'Epic', 'course', 'been', 'literature', 'long', 'time', 'only', 'last', 'forty', 'years', 'have', 'movie', 'makers', 'begun', 'developing', 'tools', 'produce', 'effects', 'needed', 'bring', 'stories', 'life', 'believable', 'creatures', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'be', 'represented', 'human', 'actors', 'animals', 'costume', 'makeup', 'beleivable', 'representation', 'magic', 'huge', 'scale', 'audience', 'willing', 'accept', 'real', 'physical', 'world', 'see', 'not', 'only', 'possible', 'world', 'possible', 'intelligent', 'imaginative', 'person', 'create', 'fictional', 'world', 'where', 'laws', 'science', 'know', 'not', 'necessarily', 'apply.This', 'such', 'movie', 'complete', 'fantasy', 'such', 'many', 'rules', 'logic', 'other', 'genres', 'do', 'not', 'apply', 'not', 'necessary', 'character', 'Hero', 'be', 'fully', 'developed', 'sufficient', 'intentions', 'are', 'Good', 'brave', 'reasonably', 'likeable', 'course', 'much', 'better', 'fully', 'rounded', 'character', 'feelings', 'be', 'well', 'expressed', 'really', 'symbol', 'forces', 'Goodness', 'therefore', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'carefully', 'drawn', 'Likewise', 'villain', 'only', 'symbol', 'forces', 'Evil', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'less', 'well', 'defined', 'same', 'vein', 'Deus', 'Ex', 'Machina', 'perfectly', 'acceptable', 'device', 'bring', 'about', 'destruction', 'forces', 'Evil', 'major', 'belief', 'almost', 'major', 'religion', 'human', 'being', 'alone', 'not', 'capable', 'resisting', 'true', 'Evil', 'faith', 'grace', 'deity', 'absolutely', 'needed', 'overcome', 'Evil.In', 'essence', 'plot', 'Epic', 'fantasy', 'basically', 'form', 'melodrama', 'First', 'Hero', 'introduced', 'Heroine', 'rest', 'Good', 'people', 'Then', 'Villain', 'enters', 'usually', 'disguised', 'thinly', 'good', 'person', 'Villain', 'then', 'henchmen', 'secretly', 'gaining', 'confidence', 'good', 'people', 'tricking', 'doing', 'things', 'will', 'later', 'put', 'completely', 'power', 'Hero', 'usually', 'Villain', 'not', 'believed', 'too', 'late', 'Villain', 'sprung', 'trap', 'When', 'trap', 'sprung', 'good', 'people', 'try', 'resist', 'avail', 'villain', 'trapped', 'helpless', 'Meanwhile', 'Hero', 'perseveres', 'eventually', 'Villains', 'weakness', 'villain', 'foils', 'plan', 'villain', 'foreseen', 'brute', 'force', 'good', 'people', 'dispair', 'Deus', 'Ex', 'Machina', 'intervenes', 'Villain', 'driven', 'off', 'good', 'people', 'celebrate', 'Not', 'Fantasy', 'plot', 'exactly', 'almost', 'case', 'Villain', 'menaces', 'Hero', 'resists', 'Goodness', 'wins', 'end', 'matter', 'how', 'outcome', 'be', 'end', 'next-to-last', 'scene.This', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'epic', 'follow', 'directors', 'comments', 'special', 'features', 'will', 'know', 'was', 'built', 'best', 'special', 'effects', 'CIG', 'work', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Once', 'once', 'had', 'director', 'took', 'script', 'Hollywood', 'recruited', 'actors', 'sound', 'designers', 'composer', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'developed', 'movie', 'so', 'packed', 'action', 'time', 'waste', 'expressing', 'feelings', 'opinions', 'cast', 'time', 'show', 'developing', 'love', 'story', 'hero', 'heroine', 'narrator', 'simply', 'fell', 'love', 'then', 'react', 'events', 'person', 'love', 'would.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'Yes', 'flaws', 'are', 'overshadowed', 'hard', 'work', 'effort', 'makers', 'put', 'out', 'bring', 'forth', 'examine', 'great', 'classic', 'movies', 'time', 'had', 'flaws', 'what', 'made', 'great', 'was', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'kept', 'watching', 'spite', 'movie', 'just', 'are', 'swept', 'one', 'action', 'next', 'pause', 'breathe', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'love', 'scenes', 'know', 'charactors', 'had', 'stopped', 'moving', 'long', 'make', 'love', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'eaten', 'final', 'analysis', 'well-crafted', 'action', 'adventure', 'filled', 'exceptinally', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'backed', 'excellent', 'musical', 'score', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'outstanding', 'visual', 'effects', 'critics', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'story', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'time']",Dragon Wars - D-War

Do you remember when you were in school and a teacher might have reprimanded a student (maybe it was yourself) that you would have to ""try"" to fail this miserably? Well, this movie deserves that insult.The story is a loosely strung together tale of fate that links a man and a woman in a struggle to defeat evil in the form of a 200-meter-long snake. To defeat it they must follow in the footsteps of their ancestors (a kind of 'history repeats itself' motif) and perform the right actions this time or else the evil...snake...(boy does that sound lame) will continue to wreak havoc in future generations to come. What better way than to summon a GOOD 200-meter-long snake that will defeat the evil one. Hardly a thrilling story line.On top of this is the horrendously poor acting. A side character plays a better role than the two main ones. The script is poorly delivered and made to sound hokey and lame. What should be terrifying is laughable. Failure has truly reached its summit with this film and if I had the option to give this movie no stars I would.Though, I will say that the snakes were definitely cool looking.

Is death the end of hope?  These are philosophical questions that permeate this film.From a tranquil Korean village lost in the centuries of time to a modern metropolis, the Story of Buraki and the Good Imoogi unfold.  This is the story of two ancient Korean serpents who sought the Yeouiju, a mystical orb from heaven which would transform one of the serpents into a dragon.You have the love story of Ethan and Sarah which began in that Korean village when they first faced their destiny as young lovers, Haram and Narin.  Unfortunately, their decision to defy their destinies ended in tragedy and allowed Buraki time to create an invincible army.The war between good and evil waged as Ethan and Sarah fought to survive.  Finally, the epic, climactic battle between Buraki and the Good Imoogi came down to Ethan's bravery and Sarah's ultimate sacrifice.In the end as Ethan watches the Celestial Dragon ascend to the heavens, he says good bye to Narin, his true love and Bochun, his old master and friend.  Now, he faces his destiny alone for the first time.Hyung Rae Shim wrote and directed this film.  Steve Jablonsky composed the musical score.The film ends with Arirang, an old Korean folk song, played by the Seattle Orchestra and sung by a choir of ninety members.

From the previews, it looked, at first glance, that D-Wars got it right. You had a battle royal betweem dragons and their allies against tanks and attack choppers within the steets of a crowded city (and this sequence is why this movie get the second star from me).Unfortunately, that is a small portion of this movie.

I didn't think it could get any worse thanSahara (Widescreen Edition)but man oh man was I wrong? I actually went out of my way to go see this movie because the previews made it look like something I was in the mood to see, a mindless action flick with dragons. I love dragon movies, and I was really in the mood for some action, but NO! There is NO action in this god forsaken movie. I can honestly say that the $7 I spent on my ticket were the worst $7 I've ever spent ON ANYTHING!For a movie called Dragon Wars, there's one thing that's noticeably absent throughout almost the entire movie, the dragons. The entire first 3/4ths of this movie center around some mindless plot from ancient Korea that is so needlessly complicated that I literally fell asleep while watching. Some giant snake wants to go to heaven, so it needs to eat a Korean girl with a dragon tattoo on her shoulder but she gets away and dies so he needs to wait another 500 years for her to come back alive... in LA? Huh? And the snake thing is already there waiting for her? How did it know she was there? For that matter, how could a giant snake sneak around LA, slither onto rooftops of crowded buildings, and eat an elephant from a zoo, without anyone seeing it? Hell, at one point it charges down a crowded street and then disappears without a trace. Yeah, right.Finally, in the last 20 minutes or so of the movie, I finally got to see a battle with dragons and, uh, giant rhino things on one side and the US military on the other, and I have to admit that its not that bad, but it only lasts about five minutes and then goes back to the brain dead plot. Come on, the only reason I went to see this movie was because I wanted some mindless violence and dragon battles. Is that so much to ask for?Don't even get me started on the acting, the script, or the effects; I'd never finish this review if I tried to explain just how bad they were. Let's just say that I had to watch this movie again, I'd probably stab myself in the knee just to dull the pain.

I think this would a been a great movie if it wasn't for a few things. Number one problem (IMO) was the lead male character - I don't know if it was the actor (Jason Behr, I think) or just the character he was playing, but he just seemed to suck the life out of every scene he was in. I think if his character had a bit more personality, the movie would have been a lot better. The editor could have done a bit more with the pacing of the movie - it is a bit uneven in places. Felt like you were hitting speed bumps during some parts.What I did like: The special effects were great!

Sargent""","[1, 1]","The director, Korea's most popular comedian, decided to realize his dream of making a high-tech sci-fi/fantasy film with a budget Hollywood would scoff at. His sincerity and years of intense effort paid off. He took a Korean legend, added to it, and went to several big shot American effects people, soundtrack writers, sound man, and the City of Los Angeles, asking them to help him make this film. He wanted it to be the best and most expensive sci-fi/fantasy film Korea had ever made, and the clips he showed in the U.S. convinced the people he needed to help him for a fee WAY below their usual. He built his own studio, invited experts and amateurs alike to help him put this together, and he realized his dream. The animatronic creatures (more than just dragons here!), CGI and miniature buildings are really well done. No, it doesn't look like a Godzilla film! The American actors (most of the cast, and it was made in English) are not all that scintillating, and the details of the storyline are a little shaky here and there. But all-in-all, I enjoyed the film and recommend it. The first part is a bit slow, but once the dragons and other creatures are released, it's great fun. How the director ever talked the city of L.A. to allow him to film tanks in the street after 9/11 is a mystery to me and, judging from the bonus feature, to the director, but he did it!

Still, not having that much disposable income, I decided against it. Months later, Christmas morning, my kids gave it to me as something of a joke gift. That night, the four of us gathered together, fully anticipating a glorious B-movie cheesefest. We were all so sadly disappointed. It isn't that the armed lizards weren't in it, but it was just so insipid, so poorly written and acted, and so entirely reliant on CGI effects that we found nothing to convince us not to take it back for a trade-in. You know a movie is bad when it fails to live up (or down) to even the most jaded movie fan's low standards. This movie had the overall feel of a bad tv show, or more accurately, a long, unending toy commercial (figures sold separately). I'd rather sit through episodes of The Land of the Lost until I went insane than watch this terrible film again. As for the special effects, this is the 21st century...so what? After Jurassic Park, it's all pretty much a yawn. Alas, so many movie makers feel that all that is needed are some CGI monsters/explosions/lizards with missile launchers and all other sins will be forgiven. It seems particularly appropo to the horror/sci-fi genre and explains why so many comic books and/or video games are coming to the big screen (with such poor results). Just because you can make it seem as if Mario and Luigi really are gobbling up mushrooms and beating on geese-turtles doesn't mean you should.In a marketplace overflowing with fantastically bad movies, you have far better choices for a night of hilarity and sarcastic voice-overs than this poor excuse of a movie. Furthermore, part of the charm of the 50s-70s crap is the supremely laughable special effects.

extravaganza.After seeing the trailer for this film, I was looking forward to a pretty good flick, but then I started to read many disparaging reviews, and had second thoughts, but lucky for me, I found a new copy for a ridiculously low price, and figured, what the heck.One hour and twenty two minutes later, the film was over, one minute after that, I was in the car, racing back to the place I had gotten my copy, in hopes that the other copy they had, was still there, because I knew that once my friend had seen it, he'd want his own copy.It is really that much fun.First off, from the reviews that I had read, they made it sound like you had to wait till the end of the film to see any actual special effects, but boy, was that nowhere close to the truth, as the whole film is laced with amazing CGI creatures, interacting quite seamlessly with the real world (think Jurassic Park's T-Rex and the SUV's, but done on a grander scale, and you've got a slight idea of how cool the effects are).Now before I go any further, let me point out that I'm of the old F/X school of thought, tending to prefer models and stop motion animation to the over use of CGI, but I have to say that the CGI creatures in this film had life to them, with amazingly subtle gestures incorporated with very life like texturing and personality that just totally made you believe that what you where watching was really happening.Next I had read that the story was silly, with gapping plot holes or that it was just  completely incomprehensible, well, for any one with a short attention span, or who thinks that they don't have to actually watch the whole film to understand it, then yeah, but for majority of movie watchers who like to pop some corn, turn down the lights, and amerce themselves in a great flick, then the film makes sense, and is a whole lotta fun to watch.And lastly, I read that the acting and directing was sub par, but I found the acting to be fine, in the context of what is happening in the film, and as for the directing, this director could put Michael Bay to shame, what with the insane amount of CGI interlaced with real elements (i.e. people, cars, etc.) that appear quite seamlessly through out the film.So if you're in the mood for a fun little thrill ride, popcorn muncher of a movie, then give this one a try.",5,10+++ STARS FOR THIS FILM (I kid you

1119136,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,B000YDOOEQ,the masked reviewer,"[1, 1]","When the folks behind DRAGON WARS decide to sic that giant snake and those prehistoric dino-birds on downtown L.A., the movie becomes enormously watchable. Until then, there's nothing to indicate that anybody involved with this unintentionally hysterical fantasy knows what the hell they are doing. Funnier when it tries to be serious, this one's for connoisseurs of the Bad Movies We Love. (And you know who you are.)With its competent creature effects and even an homage to THE PHANTOM MENACE, (Of all things), you'll roar with glee over writer-director Shim Hyung-rae's insanely convoluted plot about how every 500 years, a girl is born who, at the age of 20, will grow - for lack of a better term - a giant glass energy ball inside of her, which must then be cut out -- killing the girl, mind you! -- and offered as a sacrifice to either the ""good"" Imoogi or the evil Buraka, two giant serpents who will transform into dragons if they eat said magic ball. To explain all this, we have Robert Forster as the reincarnation of an ancient Korean warlord, and some truly fashion - and acting - impaired leads in Amanda Brooks and Jason Behr. The latter plays a reporter who rather hilariously leaves his black friend behind to get killed in almost every perilous situation.In the opening minutes, a narrator explains that 500 years ago a girl was born who can turn a serpent into a dragon. The first girl, a Korean lass in the 16th century, has been reincarnated as a dull Southern Californian named Sarah (Brooks). The snake and some crypto-medieval army are after her; yet, as befits some certain pretty L.A. girls, she's clueless. Her dreams of doom get her institutionalized, but a young reporter named Ethan (Behr) - reincarnated himself, maybe from the 16th-century Korean Tom Cruise - knows what's up and tries to keep her alive.Beachfront make-outs and mysterious clothes changes ensue.The computer-generated birds breathe fire on people. The helicopters empty round after round on the relentless snake. The snake lunges at cars and slings them 200 feet. The cameras whoosh between skyscrapers and plummet with burning helicopters and dying birds. (The sequence with Behr and Brooks caressing on a rooftop while bullet casings rain down on them is truly special and should have director Michael Bay writhing with envy.)Shim was obviously going for an adventure with a GODZILLA-like feel, but the camp panic and mock seriousness undermine his efforts at every turn. And some of the dialogue suggests a John Hughes version of THE LORD OF THE RINGS: ""The fate of the world rests on your shoulders,"" says wise old Robert Forster to Jason Behr. ""Deny this. And you will deny yourself everything. Even the girl.""Hoo-boy! Cue the Psychedelic Furs and batten the hatches.",5,"A HILARIOUS PUT-ON OR THE WORST MOVIE EVER?

1119137,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000YDOOEQ,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","""Dragon Wars - D War"" harks back to the old days of Godzilla and other countless monster flicks. The concept is simple. You will be watching huge creatures, in this case a huge dragon, smash buildings and crash cars somewhere in Los Angles. You will find it extremely hard to follow the film's complicated story, but never mind. The visuals are decent and the film is certainly a guilty pleasure. It is like watching a Godzilla movie directed by Edward D. Wood Jr. You just cannot hate it, can you?Still I must say the story of ""Dragon Wars"" is terribly convoluted. Jason Behr is a reporter Ethan who recollects his meeting 15 years ago with an antique shop owner Jack (Robert Forster) who tells the young Ethan an old Korean legend about two dragons and a couple of star-crosses lovers. Understand? Me? No, but do I have to?Anyway, Ethan believes Sarah, 19-year-old American girl (Amanda Brooks), may be the key to saving the world. They meet and fall in love with each other in a most implausible way before a big dragon and an army of other creatures led by a shape-shifting warrior chase them.Comedian-turned-director Hyung-rae Shim is no stranger to monster movies. He previously worked as director in 1999 and his film was ""2001 Yonggary"" (also known as ""Reptilian""), a remake of the 1967 film ""Yongary,"" one of the Godzilla rip-offs of the day. As he did in ""Reptilian,"" Hyung-rae Shim spent much time and money on special effects. Some of them are very impressive even though some clearly need improvement.If you are looking for better acting, better story and three-dimensional characters, you can choose ""Gwoemul"" or ""The Host"" directed by Joon-ho Bong. ""Dragon Wars - D War"" is a typical case of ""so bad so good"" and should be seen and enjoyed as such.",2,Imagine a Monster Movie Directed by Edward D.

1119138,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000YDOOEQ,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","The narrator of DRAGON WARS: D-WAR explains in the opening scenes of the movie that the film is based upon a Korean legend.  Viewers should take that into account because even though the title says DRAGON WARS, the movie doesn't have any dragons until the end and is instead all about the Korean legend.The movie opens when a handsome reporter for a national news organization, Ethan Kendrick (Jason Behr) arrives upon the scene of a massive ""incident"".  It's never really revealed what the incident is, but there's lots of destruction and many people are hurt.  While at the scene, Ethan sees an object that reminds him of a strange happening of his youth.  Flashback to fifteen years earlier when Ethan is with his father at a junk and antique story run by a guy named Jack (Robert Forster).  Ethan comes across a box that contains an item just like the one he sees at the incident site in the future.  Jack pretends to have an episode with his heart so that he can be left alone in the store with Ethan to tell him what has happened.  Apparently, Ethan is the reincarnation of an ancient warrior whose sole purpose is to make sure that a young woman, the Yuh Yi Joo, who was born with a mysterious power and the mark of the dragon.  The Yuh Yi Joo is to be united with the Imoogi (good giant snake creature) so that the Imoogi can become a dragon, protect humanity, and ascend into heaven.  In his former life 500 years before, Ethan failed at his task and now is being given another opportunity.  If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry; you don't have to really know what's going on to be able to enjoy the film.Besides the Imoogi, there is also an evil giant serpent called the Buraki that tries to prevent the Yuh Yi Joo from uniting with the Imoogi. In addition to being a huge and evil snake, the Buraki have all kinds of different minions to assist him in his destruction including a Darth Vader-look- alike warrior and his armed swordsmen, giant Stegosaurus-looking reptiles that have cannons attached to their backs, ostrich-like reptiles, and miniature flying dragons.  All of these creatures and people have awakened and are on the loose roaming around L.A. seeking out the woman who is the Yuh Yi Joo.  Ethan realizes he has to find her and get her to the Imoogi before its too late.  As it turns out the Yuh Yi Joo is a girl named Sarah (Amanda Brooks) and has been having strange dreams.  Her body is also acting really strange.  Ethan finds Sarah, but ends up falling in love with her all over again (just like he did in his first life 500 years ago) and has to decide whether to let his love rule or save the world.DRAGON WARS: D-WAR was written, directed, and co-produced by Hyung-rae Shim.  After watching the documentary featurette ""5,000 Years in the Making"" on the DVD, I learned that Shim is the most famous comic in Korea.  In Korea, he's like Jim Carrey, Steve Carrel, and Will Ferrell all combined.  He had wanted to direct a major movie for sometime and decided he would adapt the Korean story of the Imoogi into a modern, Western setting.  The movie took over five years to make and cost around seven million dollars to make.  It was apparently was Shim's desire that the film serve as a springboard for Korean films to get into the lucrative Western (U.S.) market.  As for as Korean films go, the movie is one of the highest grossing Korean movies of all time and it received and was released on a wide scale in the United States.The movie does have a very complex and convoluted plot. But, that's no different than any other Asian sci-fi-action movies.  The writing is atrocious, but considering the script was written by a Korean who doesn't speak very much English, it's not as bad as it could be.  The actors do a decent job considering the material they have.  The special effects are very well done and are probably the best part of the film.  In my opinion, the action sequences are the best part of the movie.  I found it highly entertaining to watch the technologically advanced military forces fighting against giant reptiles and men wearing magically armor fighting with swords.  There's also a lot of comedy in the movie.  For instance, there is one scene when this ancient evil warrior who worships the Baraki gets ran over by a car not once, but twice within three minutes. I found myself almost rolling on the floor in laughter at that point.  I realize that even though DRAGON WARS: D-WAR was made by the biggest comic in Korea, it isn't supposed to be very funny. Nevertheless, it is.Recommended for anyone who is looking for a complete mind-candy movie that doesn't really make much sense.  If you have an interest in popular foreign-based films, you may want to watch this movie.  You may not understand why it was so popular in Korea, but at least you can say you've seen one of the top-grossing Korean movies of all time.The DVD includes the featurette ""5,000 Years in the Making"" which explains how the movie came to be made, some animatics, and conceptual art gallery.  I highly recommend watching ""5,000 Years in the Making"" either before or after watching the movie because it provides some great background information.",2,Kung-Fu Fighting Reptiles in Downtown
