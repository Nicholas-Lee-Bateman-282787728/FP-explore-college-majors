762061,A91BK8S5QH98K,B0000A9GL0,CelticWomanFanPiano,"[1, 1]","This movie is a good quality movie.  It has a very compelling theme of second chances and getting one's life straight and in order.  It does have I think two or three swear words in it, but other than that it is suitable for family viewing.  There is a light love story that's nicely done.  Casper Van Dien portrays a convict who has spent one/third of his life in and out of jail.  When faced with the reality of losing custody of his son he tries to improve himself by getting an equestrian certificate.  It is very touching how excited he gets when he is given the certificate.  It is like a made-for-tv movie, but then those are some of the best out there right now.  I do recommend this movie highly.",5,Good quality Movie,1214697600,"06 29, 2008",2008,705,"['movie', 'good', 'quality', 'movie', 'very', 'compelling', 'theme', 'second', 'chances', 'getting', 'one', 'life', 'straight', 'order', 'have', 'think', 'two', 'three', 'swear', 'words', 'other', 'suitable', 'family', 'viewing', 'light', 'love', 'story', 'nicely', 'done', 'Casper', 'Van', 'Dien', 'convict', 'who', 'spent', 'one/third', 'life', 'jail', 'When', 'faced', 'reality', 'losing', 'custody', 'son', 'improve', 'getting', 'equestrian', 'certificate', 'very', 'touching', 'how', 'excited', 'when', 'given', 'certificate', 'made-for-tv', 'movie', 'then', 'are', 'best', 'there', 'right', 'now', 'do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'highly']",Big Spender VHS

The horse does not have a ""rotten temperament,"" as one reviewer put it, but was an abused/neglected Thoroughbred who had given up and was close to death when he and Eddie (van Dien) form a bond that saves both of their futures.The movie is sentimental (which I don't necessarily consider a fault), and a little far-fetched in that winning one horse show would not in reality save anyone from financial ruin. Serious horse-showing (where the big money is) is extremely expensive and time-consuming.That said, I still highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves horses. I volunteer at a horse retirement farm, so I can relate to a lot of the things in this movie. I own a copy of this movie on VHS, and am going to order it on DVD.
