1186105,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B001EN5I3Q,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","""Reaper"" premiered on the CW network in the fall of 2007. It arrived with much critical acclaim and the backing of Kevin Smith, who directed the pilot episode. It was a step in the right direction for the CW. Something new, fresh, clever and not another teen sudser(although the network would continue to go after those kinds of shows with the same thing over and over again). ""Reaper"" debuted with soft ratings, but it held it's own and, at the end of it's first season, was slightly higher rated than the network's golden child, ""Gossip Girl"". Of course, ""Reaper"" was the one 'on the bubble'. Season one of the show was zany and fun to watch and showed a lot of potential. It had it's flaws, but we'kk get to that later. First, on with what the show is about....Sam Oliver(Bret Harrison, ""Grounded For Life"")is a 21 year old slacker who works at the Work Bench, a home depot type place, in Seattle(although actually shot in Vancouver). On his 21st birthday, he learns that his parents had sold his soul to the devil(the brilliantly engaging Ray Wise, ""Twin Peaks"", ""Jeepers Creepers 2""), and now the Devil has come calling. He tells Sam he is to be his bounty hunter, and catch escaped souls and send them back to hell. Each week, the Devil has a vessel to trap the souls in and send them back. Just like Buffy had her 'Scooby Gang', Sam has his best buddies at the work bench - Sock(the immensely talented Tyler Labine), and Ben(Rick Gonzalez). There is also Sam's dream girl, Andi(the gorgeous Missy Peregrym, ""Heroes""). Sam, along with the help of his two best buds, sets out on his mission and tries to deal with his new lot in life. Oh, and where he goes to send the souls back?. The DMV. Brilliant.The ""Pilot"" episode showed that this was a series with a great, fun premise, and a lot of potential. It was both hysterically funny and wickedly witty, strong traits of the entire series. The show never stops being very entertaining and watchable, and has a cast of unique, vibrant characters, who are brought to life by a very talented cast. Even though the show never stops being fun, there was a bit of a drop off from the potential of the first episode. Season 1's main flaw, at least with the first half of the season, is that it never rose to the potential set forth in the premiere episode. For several episodes, it seems to be standing in place. Never seeming to really be going anywhere with any sense of direction or purpose. It was basically a lost soul, get a vessel, send it back, pine for Andi. A lot of episodes seemed to be the same thing with different vessels. Of course, a lot of shows' first season is a training ground. People in front of and behind the cameras are trying to find their feet, get a firm hold on who everyone is and the premise. It could be challenging, especially with a colorful show like 'Reaper'. Thankfully, the show, in it's later episodes of season one, found it's footing and stepped into a storyarc of it's own that started to see the show reach the potential it so wonderfully showed in the first episode. Even though some episodes were routine and by the book early on, they all worked because of the wonderful wit, set-up, and the great characters. Bret Harrison is solid and likeable as Sam. You really like the guy and root for him. Missy Peregrym doesn't get a whole lot to do, but boy is she purty. She has a resemblance to Hilary Swank. Sam's buddies are just the best. Tyler Labine's Sock has to be one of the best, and funniest, characters currently on television. He's the sort of chubby, hysterical, party guy, and Labine is perfect. He makes me laugh out loud. Rick Gonzalez holds his own as Ben, or Benji as Sock likes to call him. A trusty and dependable friend. Everyone should have a Ben and Sock. And last, but certainly not least, there is Ray Wise as the Devil. He truly is Emmy-worthy. Charming, sly, sneaky, and obviously dangerous just below the smiling, well coifed persona he presents himself in. He gets off some great lines as well. Donovan Stinson, who plays the manager of the Work Bench Ted, should also be mentioned. He provides some great comic relief.""Reaper"" is just fun. There are a lot of highlights. The ""Pilot"" is a great introduction to the world of the show. It also shows Sam's younger brother, who was wisely written out of the show. He didn't fit at all. ""Charged"" and ""All Mine"" are routine, but enjoyable. ""Leon"" is a Halloween episode, and points go for the episode title ""What About Blob"". Elsewhere, you can find ""X-Files"" vet Mitch Pileggi in ""The Cop"", and Buffy/Angel star Mercedes McNab in ""Love, Bullets & Blacktop"". Beginning with ""Hungry For Fame"", which features Jamie Kennedy(""Scream""), the series picks up on it's momentum  and the rest of the season finds the show growing and developing into a well rounded series. ""Unseen"" features the wonderful introduction to two gay demons, Tony and Steve. Hilarious. The show then finds intself in a story arc beginning with ""Rebellion"", and sets itself up for the remaining 4 episodes of the series. ""Coming To Grips"", and the finale, ""Cancun"", show that 'Reaper' is a series that has truly found where it's going and the future looked bright. Speaking of episodes, season one only had 18 episodes instead of the usual 22, thanks to the writer's strike.""Reaper"" is a show that starts off so entertainingly, and only re-captures the potential by the second half of the year. But that's okay. When a show is this fun, entertaining, wickedly funny, and with a great set of characters, getting there is just a blast.",4,"The Devil, You Say....",1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,5564,"['Reaper',

I have all the Buffy, Angel, Smallville, Supernatural (though I gave up on this one after season 6) & Vampire Diaries on dvd. Reaper rates right up there with those great shows b/c it is a lot of fun. Like another reviewer said, it is a comedic show with some dramatic tones- not the other way around, like all the shows just listed. Reaper was light-hearted and cute without being too heavy with the drama. Who knows where it would have gone since it was cancelled after season two, but at least we have two seasons of fun and wacky adventures with the boys affectionately referred to as ""Satan's slackers.""Sam and his two coworker best friends have to save the day in each episode as they track down some escaped soul from hell for their boss the devil. Of course Sam's love life suffers unsurprisingly when his devil duties inevitably interfere with his relationship with coworker Andi. She eventually learns of his secret and starts helping the gang but not without encountering her fair share of trouble and danger.This show is cleverly written with great characters who are witty and fun. If you are looking for a good show to watch, this one is cute, light, fun and funny. Like I said, it leans more towards funny than dramatic but it's still a good mix of both. It even has some scary elements in it that just make it all that much more fun. Kids and adults can appreciate this gem of a show from filmmaker Kevin Smith who brought us Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma and Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back among others.

1186118,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001EN5I3Q,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Every place that seems like Hell on Earth is actually indeed a portal to Hell. If nothing else, REAPER cements the DMV's reputation as a place of the damned. Awesomely, this series is peppered with other like conceits. On his twenty-first birthday, slacker Sam Oliver learns that his parents didn't buy him a car for his present, but they did sell his soul to the Devil. More specifically, Sam's parents sold his soul to the Devil before he was even born. They just waited 'til his twenty-first birthday to tell him. A car would've gone down better. In a weird way, this infernal contract turns out to be beneficial to the rudderless Sam. Old Scratch, instead of dragging him down to Hell, tasks him with tracking down escaped souls and returning them to Hell. With each mission Sam receives a wooden box which supplies him with the appropriate fiendish tool (or ""vessel"") to get the job done, except that these tools take the shape of everyday household items.It could've been so much worse for Sam Oliver. But as Satan's bounty hunter, he still gets to eke out a normal life on Earth. And by ""normal life"" it's meant that Sam still toils at his dead-end gig at the Work Bench, the local home-improvement store, and still pines for the cute and level-headed Andi Prendergast (Missy Peregrym, who here has got that Hilary Swank look down). So, all parallels drawn to CHUCK are perhaps valid. Except that REAPER isn't written or acted or executed as well as CHUCK, and the special effects are pure queso. What REAPER has going for it is a certain shabby likability and a wonderful, quirky sense of fun. The show's primary weapon is clearly Ray Wise who plays Satan with equal doses of roguishness and menace. Ray Wise is so tanned George Hamilton is staring daggers at him. The Devil, for whatever reason, seems intent on cozying up to Sam. But Sam sort of has it in his mind to find a loophole in his contract. Meanwhile, we endure episode after episode of the guy whining and moping and acting the weak wallflower when it comes to his love life. It makes for a frustrating watch. ""Grow a set, Sam!"" I yelled at the screen until the neighbors furiously knocked on my door.Sam's best friend, Sock, is always good for laughs. Sock is one of those crazy chums that always lands you in trouble just by association. But Sock and Sam's other buddy, Ben (Rick Gonzalez), are loyal and they provide invaluable backup to Sam's demonic missions. Sock is played by the hilarious Tyler Labine who looks like Ryan Reynolds fifty pounds later.As has been pointed out, much of Sam's more mundane dealings concerns his passive-aggressive romancing of Andi. But another ongoing thread - which ties into his wanting out of his indentured service to the Prince of Lies - follows his involvement with the underground demon rebellion seeking to overthrow Satan. These fallen angels have arrived at a sly scheme, except what chance do they really have when, as they say, the Devil's in the details? The Devil's tanned, not stupid. As Satan ominously remarks to his newest bounty hunter: ""I won't be dissed, Sam.""After two seasons of laughs and quirkiness and Sam Oliver battling supernatural fugitives - with each of his targets possessed of a terrifying power - REAPER was, er, exorcised from the small screen. CW just wouldn't give the Devil his due. I'm pretty bummed out. But at least my neighbors leave me alone again.For those wondering, REAPER Season One has 5 discs containing all 18 episodes and with the following bonus material: an audio commentary for the pilot episode; deleted scenes; and a gag reel.",4,"""Sam, I'm not a carjacker.

1186123,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001EN5I3Q,Mark Turner,"[4, 4]","Once again I have to proclaim that DVD has made television more accessible than ever. Where we were once limited to watching one show or another we moved on with the advent of the VCR. All was well and fine until cable, then dish, offered us so many shows that to choose from just two seemed impossible. Now you could either go for TIVO or you could simply wait until a series came out on DVD. And as those shows have been made available, we now have the opportunity to catch them not only in all their glory but uninterrupted by commercials as well!So what buried treasure arrives now? REAPER! Yes the quirky new series that got lost in the world that is CW network is now available DVD. The first season box set offers the show's pilot as well as all episodes that aired this first year. Soon to return for season two, this disc set is the best way to prepare for what could be a new take.The story revolves around Sam Oliver (Brett Harrison), a young slacker who has no ambition of plan for his life. Living at home with his folks by choice, working at the local Work Bench (a thinly disguised Home Depot look-a-like) and doing nothing more than hang out with his friends, Sam's life changes on his 21st birthday. A seemingly chance encounter with a man proclaiming to be the Devil (Ray Wise) lets Sam know that he now owns his soul.It turns out that Sam's parents sold his soul to the devil years before. Sam's father was dying of cancer and to save him, they sold Sam off when his 21st birthday arrived. Now payment is due. But rather than just whisk him away, the Devil has other plans for Sam.Those plans have Sam capturing escaped souls from Hell. Each week the Devil points Sam in the direction of an escaped soul and provides him with the proper vessel with which to capture them. Toaster, handvac or whatever seems appropriate (or not), the vessel is used to capture the soul which is then taken to a download station. What better place to represent Hell on earth than the Dept. of Motor Vehicles?The fun of the plot revolves around the different characters that Sam must capture each week. The show feels like a cross between BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and the Three Stooges. Sure, you have demonic creatures and lost souls roaming the earth and needing capture, but at the same time enough humor is tossed in to make the show not taken so seriously.Most of the humor lies in Sam's friends Ben and Sock. Ben seems the smarter of the two, more serious and played by Rick Gonzalez he comes off as the more inventive one. Bert ""Sock"" Wysocki is played Tyler Labine. Sock is the funnier of the two, a total nutcase with low expectations of himself that he fulfills daily. Without a care in the world he floats through life being the loveable goofball of the group. But don't be fooled. Both of these friends would do anything and everything in their power for Sam and for each other.Sam also has the girl of his dreams in Andi (Missy Peregrym) who works at The Work Bench with the three soul hunters. While she has no clue as to what they are doing, she has a fondness for Sam that he shares with her while never quite expressing it. This tension makes for the romantic end of the show but not enough to infringe on the humor.As Sam, Harrison is the essential everyman. Not too good looking, not too normal, but just right as the neer do well who realizes his life has been meaningless only to find he is left with no life left to live. Or does he?Ray Wise steals the show from all actors involved with each appearance on screen. Wise has always done a fantastic job from his performance as Leland Palmer in TWIN PEAKS to a stint as Vice President in 24, Wise is always a believable character and more often than not, has that demonic look about him. Which makes him perfect for this role.The show changes midstream as we learn more about the deal with the Devil. It also turns a bit when demons begin to turn up. What this means for the show, and for season two, is yet to be seen. In the meantime, this season set will make for many an entertaining night on the old DVD player.",5,THE DEVIL YOU SAY,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,4085,"['Once', 'again', 'have', 'proclaim', 'DVD', 'made', 'television', 'more', 'accessible', 'ever', 'Where', 'were', 'once', 'limited', 'watching', 'one', 'show', 'moved', 'advent', 'VCR', 'was', 'well', 'fine', 'cable', 'then', 'dish', 'offered', 'so', 'many', 'shows', 'choose', 'just', 'two', 'seemed', 'impossible', 'Now', 'could', 'either', 'go', 'TIVO', 'could', 'simply', 'wait', 'series', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'shows', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'available', 'now', 'have', 'opportunity', 'catch', 'not', 'only', 'glory', 'uninterrupted', 'commercials', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'what', 'buried', 'treasure', 'arrives', 'now', 'REAPER', 'Yes', 'quirky', 'new', 'series', 'got', 'lost', 'world', 'CW', 'network', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'first', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'show', 'pilot', 'as', 'well', 'aired', 'first', 'year', 'Soon', 'return', 'season', 'two', 'disc', 'set', 'best', 'way', 'prepare', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'new', 'take.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Sam', 'Oliver', 'Brett', 'Harrison', 'young', 'slacker', 'who', 'ambition', 'plan', 'life', 'Living', 'home', 'folks', 'choice', 'working', 'local', 'Work', 'Bench', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'Home', 'Depot', 'look-a-like', 'doing', 'nothing', 'more', 'hang', 'friends', 'Sam', 'life', 'changes', '21st', 'birthday', 'seemingly', 'chance', 'encounter', 'man', 'proclaiming', 'be', 'Devil', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'Sam', 'know', 'now', 'soul.It', 'out', 'Sam', 'parents', 'sold', 'soul', 'devil', 'years', 'Sam', 'father', 'was', 'dying', 'cancer', 'save', 'sold', 'Sam', 'off', 'when', '21st', 'birthday', 'arrived', 'Now', 'payment', 'due', 'rather', 'just', 'whisk', 'away', 'Devil', 'other', 'plans', 'Sam.Those', 'plans', 'have', 'Sam', 'capturing', 'escaped', 'souls', 'Hell', 'week', 'Devil', 'points', 'Sam', 'direction', 'escaped', 'soul', 'proper', 'vessel', 'capture', 'Toaster', 'handvac', 'appropriate', 'not', 'vessel', 'used', 'capture', 'soul', 'then', 'taken', 'download', 'station', 'What', 'better', 'place', 'represent', 'Hell', 'earth', 'Dept', 'Motor', 'Vehicles', 'fun', 'plot', 'different', 'characters', 'Sam', 'must', 'capture', 'week', 'show', 'cross', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Sure', 'have', 'demonic', 'creatures', 'lost', 'souls', 'roaming', 'earth', 'needing', 'capture', 'same', 'time', 'enough', 'humor', 'tossed', 'make', 'show', 'not', 'taken', 'so', 'seriously.Most', 'humor', 'Sam', 'friends', 'Ben', 'Sock', 'Ben', 'smarter', 'two', 'more', 'serious', 'played', 'Rick', 'Gonzalez', 'off', 'more', 'inventive', 'one', 'Bert', 'Sock', 'Wysocki', 'played', 'Tyler', 'Labine', 'Sock', 'funnier', 'two', 'total', 'nutcase', 'low', 'expectations', 'daily', 'care', 'world', 'life', 'being', 'loveable', 'goofball', 'group', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'friends', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'everything', 'power', 'Sam', 'other.Sam', 'also', 'girl', 'dreams', 'Andi', 'Missy', 'Peregrym', 'who', 'Work', 'Bench', 'three', 'soul', 'hunters', 'clue', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'fondness', 'Sam', 'shares', 'never', 'quite', 'expressing', 'tension', 'romantic', 'end', 'show', 'not', 'enough', 'infringe', 'humor.As', 'Sam', 'Harrison', 'essential', 'everyman', 'Not', 'too', 'good', 'looking', 'not', 'too', 'normal', 'just', 'right', 'neer', 'do', 'well', 'who', 'life', 'been', 'meaningless', 'only', 'find', 'left', 'life', 'left', 'live', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'show', 'actors', 'involved', 'appearance', 'screen', 'Wise', 'always', 'done', 'fantastic', 'job', 'performance', 'Leland', 'Palmer', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'stint', 'Vice', 'President', '24', 'Wise', 'always', 'believable', 'character', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'demonic', 'look', 'Which', 'perfect', 'role.The', 'show', 'midstream', 'learn', 'more', 'deal', 'Devil', 'also', 'bit', 'when', 'demons', 'begin', 'turn', 'up', 'What', 'show', 'season', 'two', 'yet', 'be', 'seen', 'meantime', 'season', 'set', 'will', 'make', 'many', 'entertaining', 'night', 'old', 'DVD', 'player']",Reaper: Season 1

It's very light and doesn't require much thinking or involvement, but you have a darn good time watching it. This show is not about the action, though it does have some. The catching of the souls that have escaped Hell doesn't really hold much interest and is usually a minor part of each episode, but it's everything else that works so well. Okay, the special effects could be better, but the casting is just about perfect. The two standouts are Ray Wise as Satan himself and Tyler Labine as the slacker Sock. They both have great comedic timing and Tyler is just so natural and funny. Ray Wise has got the best evil (with a side of wisecracking) smile you will ever see. They are both given some great lines, so the writers deserve some credit as well. The rest of the cast is pretty good, but a certain character that I like now (that's you Ben) is not given much to do until season two. The main character (Sam) is a little boring to me, but I guess he is the glue that holds all the other more appealing personalities together. Andi's (Missy Peregrym) back and forth relationship with Sam gets tiresome, but at least she is very nice to look at. Like Ben, her character gets more to do in the current season that is coming to a close next week.Hopefully they won't cancel Reaper after only two seasons.

It has some unevenness in the storyline, like Sam's vanishing little brother, but overall the quality of acting and writing is consistent. Ray Wise is a riot as the devil:  slippery and charming, with some great one-liners.  The boss at the Work Bench, Ted, is a perfect portrayal of a petty tyrant still working through his high school issues.  Also great from late in the season are the gay neighbors when Sam moves out of his parents' house:  no spoilers, but there is something strange about these two.  Sam is a little too gullible to be believable sometimes (can he not remember that he's talking to the DEVIL?), but that might be part of why he's so likable.  I also got tired of the whole Sam and Andi ""will they ever get together?"" storyline, but whatever.

In the new CW primetime series ""Reaper"", Sam Oliver (Bret Harrison, TV's Grounded for Life) was an average slacker who's parents never pressured him in his entire life but on his 21st birthday, Sam finds out that his parents sold his soul to the Devil (Ray Wise, Jeepers Creepers 2) before he was born. Forced to serve the Devil as his bounty hunter, Sam must capture escaped evil souls and send them back to Hell. ""Reaper"" is an enthusiastic supernatural sitcom that effectively combines elements of fantasy and humor. The CW series premiered in the fall of 2007 and was well received by audiences and critics. The episodes are hilariously well-written with plenty of laughs and sharp dialogue. ""Reaper"" also features a very likable cast including Tyler Labine (TV's Invasion), Rick Gonzalez (Coach Carter) and Missy Peregrym (Stick It). As the smooth-talking ruler of the Underworld, Ray Wise really shines and often steals the show. The first season delivers some good twists and its finale offers some interesting developments for the second season. The first season features guest appearances by Patton Oswalt and Jamie Kennedy.Fans of the CW primetime series might find the DVD release of ""Reaper: Season One"" a little disappointing. All 18 episodes of the first season are presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Though the episodes air in hi-def, the standard transfer in this 5-disc DVD set is really good. The 2.0 Dolby Digital audio is pretty clear and well balanced throughout. The negative aspect in this box set lies with the special features. The only audio commentary is on the pilot episode and unfortunately it provides very little information. Other extras include a short gag reel and a few deleted scenes.

1186130,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B001EN5I3Q,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[2, 12]","I'm almost to the end of the second season now. I never watched this show when it originally aired. Basically this show is quite dumb. The first season was very slow to get going. There are a lot of actors and actresses that one will recognize over the span of the two seasons, but even with them the show was just WEAK. One will compare this some to shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Supernatural or Angel, the comparison and the similarities to those shows probably kept this show on the air for two years, but ultimately the bad scripts, the very stupid scripts just destroy the show. Some of the episodes are entertaing, but as a comedy this show will not make you laugh. As a drama, it isn't very dramatic. The Sock character is just over the top. From the very first episodes Sock, or the actor, was over acting badly. He overwhelmed the show, and he is barely funny. He finally had sex with his step sister, the Asian gal, and the prelude to this, and prologue was just plain awful and painful to watch. We had to watch Sock lusting after his ""sister"" for several episodes. Combine the lust with the fact that the actor is just a big fat ass and you have one uncomfortable viewer.And as for sinister plots and the DEVIL and so on, everything that might seem sinister and EVIL gets turned into something truely STUPID and RETARDED in due time. I like the actor playing the devil. I mean it's nice to see an adult in this cast of CHILDREN but the scripts he gets thrown into could not help him.I picked this show up because I was curious and I got both seasons for about $20. That being said I can't wait to finish viewing this show. I have one more disc and hopefully it only has a couple of episodes on it. The show has some campy fun. The ""Work Bench"" idea as a place to work was a fun idea. However, the employees literally steal everything, they destroy everything, they do not work at all and the entire scenario is completely UNBELIEVABLE most of the time and it INSULTS any viewer with much intelligence. Sure, it's all good, it's all in fun, it's just tv comedy afterall, but the show isn't intelligent, it isn't funny, it is often CRUDE. One of the major problems of this show is that every character is reduced to a SLACKER. With so many SLACKERS every plot idea becomes ridiculous. Every character has to show their lack of intelligence, or ambition, or they exhibit what a moron they are. This is like the cast of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" acting out this show, to some respect anyway. It's just hard to take anyone or anything serious on this show.I think the target audience that must have appreciated this show the most would most likely have to have been a bunch of middle school kids.

1186133,A3M7RECGYLXOPA,B001EN5I3Q,The Wickerman,"[6, 6]","Well, it looks like the evil corporate machine that is television has terminated yet another excellent show.  Joining the ranks of such programs as ""Freaks and Geeks"", ""Veronica Mars"", ""Life on Mars"" (apparently shows with ""Mars"" in the title are doomed from the start?), and so many others, ""Reaper"" has met its end far too soon.  So, in light of this, I felt the need to extol this dearly departed show's greatness.The show is centered around main character Sam Oliver (played by Bret Harrison).  Sam is your average fun-loving guy, living a simple but happy life.  Then, on his 21st birthday, he discovers that his parents sold his soul to the devil before he was born, and soon the aforementioned devil (played brilliantly by Ray Wise) shows up to collect.  Sam must spend the rest of his life as the devil's bounty hunter, capturing escaped souls from hell.This concept has been done before in similar forms (""Brimstone"", ""Dead Like Me""), but here it's done with a much more light-hearted and comedic approach, which to me gives it a fresh spin.  Most of your supernaturally themed shows (""Smallville"", ""Supernatural"", ""Buffy"", ""Heroes"", etc) tend to be more dramatically intense for the most part, and much as I love all those shows, this one had a style that really set it apart from those in a good way.This, the first season, was strong from start to finish.  Like many shows of this format, it starts off with a simpler ""villain of the week"" formula, and then slowly builds toward bigger story arcs.  Sam is faced with a seemingly never-ending array of bizarre and fearsome evildoers to capture, and armed each week with a different ""vessel"" with which to catch them (which is usually in appearance just a random object, like a toaster or a hair dryer), he rounds them up one by one.  Although he feels trapped by his unholy contract, he also gets a sense of pride from his duties, realizing he is doing good for the world and saving lives.  However, since the ""reward"" for these good deeds is an eternity in Hell as the devil's right-hand man, he knows he has to find a way out.Of course, the show's biggest allure is its excellent cast.  Harrison is perfect as a good-natured slacker forced to rise to unusual but heroic responsibilities.  He does, however, have a lot of help along the way from his small but loyal group of friends.  Tyler Labine is hilarious as the wise-cracking Sock, and although he is borderline derivative of Jack Black at times, it's hard to complain when he's this good at it.  Contrastingly, there's Ben (played by underrated character actor Rick Gonzalez), who is largely Sock's opposite personality-wise: more serious and straight-laced, even a little neurotic.  However, both prove to be stalwart and reliable companions.  Ben starts out as kind of a background character, but fortunately he gets more stuff going on as the show progresses.Last but certainly not least, there's Andi (played by the oh so lovely Missy Peregrym), Sam's close friend and love interest.  Like Sock and Ben, Andi proves to be an important ally to Sam, but still his duties continually get in the way of him having the kind of relationship with her he really wants.  Missy has this rare combination of girl-next-door sweetness and supermodel hotness, and what she brings to this smart, strong, charming character is just so endearing.And of course, as I mentioned before, Ray Wise is excellent as the devil.  He is simultaneously creepy and likable, making for a villian that's anything but one-dimensional.  He seems to genuinely like and care for Sam in some twisted way (in the second season you find out a bit more about this), even though he's pretty much taking his life away from him.  We never forget throughout that the devil is heartless and evil, but at the same time he doesn't seem like a complete monster.  At times, he's even almost a sympathetic character, which I think adds an interesting dynamic.Joining the cast later in the season are Ken Marino and Michael Ian Black, who are hilarious as a gay demon couple who organize a rebellion against the devil.  Initially they are distrustful of Sam, but soon they become powerful allies who work to help Sam find a way out of his deal.If I had to complain about something, and it's not really about the show itself, but rather how the network marketed it at first, which I think might have hurt it in some way.  As you may know, Kevin Smith directed the pilot episode, and as a result, both before and after the episode aired, the network latched onto it and used Kevin Smith's name to promote it for about half the season.  Kevin Smith was neither a writer or a creator of the show, and aside from directing that one episode he pretty much had little to nothing to do with it.  And, although the show did vaguely feel a bit like a more tv-friendly version of ""Dogma"" at times, I think it was misleading, and may have possibly messed with people's expectations.  They basically marketed it as a ""Kevin Smith show"", which is never really what it was.  But, I don't know.  That just kinda bugged me, but it's probably not that big of a deal.  Anyway...At this point, it saddens me to think that this show may never reach the conclusion it deserves.  There's been talk of it being picked up in syndication, but I'm not holding my breath.  This was a fun and unique show that I'm really going to miss.",5,"Rest in peace, Reaper",1243468800,"05 28, 2009",2009,5379,"['Well', 'evil', 'corporate', 'machine', 'television', 'terminated', 'yet',
