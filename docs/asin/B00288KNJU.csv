If you had an Other Mother, what would she be like?  A girl named Coraline is about to find out!  Coraline had just moved to The Pink Palace and finds her life thrown in turmoil when she is trapped with her ""friendly"" Other Mother, who gradually shows her dark side and turns into a ruthless witch.Coraline's overworked real parents are too busy to afford what she wants, so she thinks her caring, button-eyed Other Mother is the solution, but she is actually the problem!  Coraline's new dim-witted friend Wybie's black cat, whom Coraline nick-named ""Wuss Puss"", starts going into the Other Mother's world and begins to talk in a low, eerie voice.  Wuss Puss warns Coraline, but it is too late, the Other Mother steals Coraline's real parents.Coraline must call upon courage she never knew she had to free her parents and herself to the outside world.With amazing 3-D effect, ""Coraline"" is a spectacular movie, and for every scene, you want to know what happens next!Sometimes imagination can become reality, so don't mess with it.Coraline (Single-Disc Edition w/ 3D)",4,Be Careful What You Wish for - 4 (out of 5) Starfish Rating for Coraline,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,1313,"['following', 'review', 'was', 'published', 'Del', 'Mar', 'Times', 'Carmel', 'Valley', 'Leader', 'Rancho', 'Santa', 'Fe', 'Record', 'Solana', 'Beach', 'Sun', '[', ']', 'was', '8', 'years', 'old', 'then', 'Do', 'ever', 'wish', 'had', 'two', 'mothers', 'Real', 'Mother', 'Other', 'Mother', 'had', 'Other', 'Mother', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'girl', 'named', 'Coraline', 'find', 'out', 'Coraline', 'had', 'just', 'moved', 'Pink', 'Palace', 'life', 'thrown', 'turmoil', 'when', 'trapped', 'friendly', 'Other', 'Mother', 'who', 'gradually', 'dark', 'side', 'ruthless', 'witch.Coraline', 'overworked', 'real', 'parents', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'afford', 'what', 'caring', 'button-eyed', 'Other', 'Mother', 'solution', 'actually', 'problem', 'Coraline', 'new', 'dim-witted', 'friend', 'Wybie', 'black', 'cat', 'whom', 'Coraline', 'nick-named', 'Wuss', 'Puss', 'going', 'Other', 'Mother', 'world', 'talk', 'low', 'eerie', 'voice', 'Wuss', 'Puss', 'Coraline', 'too', 'late', 'Other', 'Mother', 'steals', 'Coraline', 'real', 'parents.Coraline', 'must', 'call', 'courage', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'free', 'parents', 'outside', 'world.With', 'amazing', '3-D', 'effect', 'Coraline', 'spectacular', 'movie', 'scene', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'Sometimes', 'imagination', 'can', 'become', 'reality', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'it.Coraline', 'Single-Disc', 'Edition', '3D']",N/A

If you like creepy movies that are also brilliantly imaginative, artistically beautiful, full of wit and good writing, this is the movie for you!As most folks know, this story is about a little girl who feels neglected.  The family has just moved to a new area, and all her friends are, of course, left behind.  In the film, there is a little boy that helps with the explication, and sets up the creepiness of the old house (divided into flats) in which Coraline now lives.Coraline finds a door to another world with a sort of ""duplicate"" family, one that pays more attention to her.  What will happen?  I don't want to say more!  But it is a wonderful story.  Actually, it is difficult to say what is more fantastical in regards to her neighbors:  They are just as interesting in the ""real world""!  Absolutely wonderful, over the top, voice characterizations.A member of my family has a phobia regarding buttons (this is really true!), which play a certain part in the film, and still found the film entrancing!I hope everyone that loves movies and a good story sees this.

It features many themes that are potentially disturbing for any age. It gets down to the basics of what happens if your parents ignore you and you decide to run away...what if your fantasy Mom turns into a monster...and for me, what is the nature of an evil, suffocating mother.The stop-motion animation was truly breathtaking, and we didn't even see it in 3-D. I'd say that whether it's too scary for a child depends on the child's temperament and sensitivity rather than age. This intense, thoughtful movie is meant to be challenging.Dakota Fanning's vocal performance combined with the animation nailed the character of a disgruntled tween girl. Loved her convincing Michigan accent.Coraline reminded me of so many different works:The Wizard of OzThe Nightmare Before ChristmasThe Spiderwick Chronicles (Boxed Set): The Field Guide; The Seeing Stone; Lucinda's Secret; The Ironwood Tree; The Wrath of MulgrathTwin Peaks(dramatically bizarre characters were David Lynchian)The Ring(the super-creepy Japanese horror film. Just a little cross-over there but significant to me.)The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeDesperate Housewives(Terri Hatcher is the voice of the Mom, and the more evil she gets, the more she looks like a character from Desperate Housewives.)and, the real-life case of Nadya Suleman, mother to octuplets + 6. I can't help but mention this current reference, because I kept thinking about her when they explored the psychology of the perfect/evil Other Mother.I am giving this four stars because it's bizarre and scary enough to be polarizing--as much genuine brilliance as it has in it, it's extraordinarily strange, too.

1255385,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00288KNJU,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","Last year was rather wonderful when you consider the smart and engaging animated films that were released.  Between the Oscar winning `Up', Anderson's crack at animation, `Fantastic Mr. Fox' and the ghoulishly fantastic `Coraline', you have a spectacular year in this field that reigns supreme as the best of the decade.  While probably my least favorite of the three, `Coraline' is still one of the better films of that year and a definite must-see for any film enthusiast.In tone, this film is far different than the other two I mentioned.  In fact, all three films are so different, and I think that is another reason why this year was so great in this field.  We were offered a variety of films that excite and entertain and appeal to different sides of our cinematic taste.`Coraline' is dark and moody.  The production design here is simply flawless, brilliantly capturing the mood and feel of the film without going so overboard as to appear clunky and campy.  The attention to detail, whether it be with the characters or with the surroundings, is astonishing to look at.  Above all else, `Coraline' is a visual feast.Still, looks aren't everything.`Coraline' tells the story of a bored little girl.  Having just moved to an old house with her work obsessed parents, Coraline finds that she has nothing to do and no one to do it with.  Her parents are so confined to their work that they disregard Coraline as seemingly unimportant and her only companions are either crazy (the circus fare she lives beside) or annoying (a strange kid named Wybie).  When Wybie finds a doll that resembles Coraline, things start to change.  Coraline finds a secret door that eventually takes her to an alternate world where she has `other' parents, perfected variations of her own.  Coraline loves being in their company, but when they attempt to make her a permanent part of their lives things turn a tad ugly.The emotionally chord behind `Coraline' involves the struggle to find balance in that parent/children relationship.  On both ends we can find ourselves working against unity.  It is apparent that Coraline's parents don't consider her feelings enough (they seem almost harsh on the outset) but it is also apparent that Coraline is your average selfish teenager (or pre-teen).  Sometimes we have to take a step back and see things through the eyes of our parent or our child in order to find that unity; meeting halfway so-to-speak.  Coraline learns that the hard way, but better late than never.Visually stunning and emotionally profound, `Coraline' is smart and charmingly creepy.  It is not a film for everyone, and some children may find it a tad scary (some adults may even find it a tad scary), but that is the point of the film.",5,Life isn't always greener on the `other' side...,1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,2734,"['Last', 'year', 'was', 'rather', 'wonderful', 'when', 'consider', 'smart', 'engaging', 'animated', 'films', 'were', 'released', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Anderson', 'crack', 'animation', 'Fantastic', 'Mr.', 'Fox', 'ghoulishly', 'fantastic', 'Coraline', 'have', 'spectacular', 'year', 'field', 'supreme', 'best', 'decade', 'probably', 'least', 'favorite', 'three', 'Coraline', 'still', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'year', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'enthusiast.In', 'tone', 'film', 'far', 'different', 'other', 'two', 'mentioned', 'fact', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'think', 'reason', 'why', 'year', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'field', 'were', 'offered', 'variety', 'films', 'excite', 'entertain', 'appeal', 'different', 'sides', 'cinematic', 'taste.', 'Coraline', 'dark', 'moody', 'production', 'design', 'here', 'simply', 'flawless', 'brilliantly', 'capturing', 'mood', 'feel', 'film', 'going', 'so', 'overboard', 'appear', 'clunky', 'campy', 'attention', 'detail', 'be', 'characters', 'surroundings', 'astonishing', 'look', 'else', 'Coraline', 'visual', 'feast.Still', 'looks', 'are', ""n't"", 'everything.', 'Coraline', 'story', 'bored', 'little', 'girl', 'Having', 'just', 'moved', 'old', 'house', 'work', 'obsessed', 'parents', 'Coraline', 'nothing', 'do', 'one', 'do', 'parents', 'are', 'so', 'confined', 'work', 'disregard', 'Coraline', 'seemingly', 'unimportant', 'only', 'companions', 'are', 'crazy', 'circus', 'fare', 'beside', 'annoying', 'strange', 'kid', 'named', 'Wybie', 'When', 'Wybie', 'doll', 'Coraline', 'things', 'start', 'change', 'Coraline', 'secret', 'door', 'eventually', 'alternate', 'world', 'where', 'other', 'parents', 'perfected', 'variations', 'own', 'Coraline', 'being', 'company', 'when', 'attempt', 'make', 'permanent', 'part', 'lives', 'things', 'turn', 'tad', 'ugly.The', 'emotionally', 'chord', 'Coraline', 'struggle', 'find', 'balance', 'parent/children', 'relationship', 'can', 'find', 'working', 'unity', 'apparent', 'Coraline', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'feelings', 'enough', 'seem', 'almost', 'harsh', 'outset', 'also', 'apparent', 'Coraline', 'average', 'selfish', 'teenager', 'pre-teen', 'Sometimes', 'have', 'take', 'step', 'back', 'see', 'things', 'eyes', 'parent', 'child', 'order', 'find', 'unity', 'meeting', 'halfway', 'so-to-speak', 'Coraline', 'hard', 'way', 'better', 'late', 'never.Visually', 'stunning', 'emotionally', 'profound', 'Coraline', 'smart', 'charmingly', 'creepy', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'children', 'may', 'find', 'tad', 'scary', 'adults', 'may', 'even', 'find', 'tad', 'scary', 'point', 'film']",N/A

Chaney,"[1, 2]","Coraline, the new movie based on Neil Gaiman's YA novella, is a visually impressive film (especially in 3D) that captures a child's fantasy/horror world in frightening detail.  Coraline is a young girl that has just moved to a new town with her distracted parents.  As Coraline is exploring her new surroundings, she discovers a tiny door in one of the rooms of her house.  She goes through the door, and discovers ""the other"" world, where everything is brighter and better--the parents more attentive, her favorite foods everywhere.  Coraline soon discovers that something is off with the other world in general, and in particular with the ""other mother"" the woman who controls this alternate world.  Soon Coraline is in a rush to escape this world--but will she make it out alive?Coraline was directed by Henry Selick, the man behind the Nightmare Before Christmas.  Coraline was done completely with stop-motion animation, which makes the animated world Coraline inhabits look creepily real at times.  The detail in the film is stunning.  And there's something neat about a movie that has dolls and an alternate world where everything is made ""by hand"" as key plot points being actually made by hand by a team of animators that make and move little miniatures to make the film.  Seeing the film in 3D just enhances the effect--and makes it feel like you are actually in Coraline's world.I've seen other reviewers describe Coraline as horror movie for kids.  I think that's accurate.  The main premise of the movie--that you could end up in a world that looks better on the surface but actually turns out to be full of evil--is a pretty scary prospect for kids, in the same way that Grimm's Fairy Tales are.  I would definitely make sure a kid is not going to be totally freaked out before I let them see this movie.  But even if the kids aren't ready (or you don't have kids) adults should see this movie just to experience the visual effects.

If you or your kiddies don't want to be frightened or disturbed or enchanted, avoid ""Coraline"" at all costs! Let's just get that out of the way and move on.Now, for those of you who thrive on dark and delightfully creepy fantasy, this movie is right up your alley.]First of all, I fell in love with this story as soon as I plunged into the book by the wonderful British storyteller Neil Gaiman, who is cemented as an icon in the world of fantasy. I am an ardent fan of children's fantasy tales, horror, and all things British... so, I was charmed to the hilt with this dark and wondrous tale. And now there is a fanastic movie to enjoy.This stop-motion movie does the book justice, totally. The character designs, sets, lighting, cinematography, lovely musical score-- everything is very nicely done. You can tell that a lot of work went into this movie. There is plenty here to entertain everyone, and enough peril and danger and scary stuff to satisfy folks like myself who enjoy a good villain and some macabre trappings. Maybe you have to be a fan of all things creepy to appreciate ""Coraline"". I just happen to love scary films, fiction, and ideas.The character voices are terrific. Teri Hatcher is very effective as the Other Mother and the real mother. Dakota Fanning, Ian McShane, Dawn French, and Jennifer Saunders all contribute quite nicely.If you (or your family) have a penchant for fantasy or horror, this is for you. (And if you're into animation, all the better.) It smacks of the best Roald Dahl tales, of Alice's wild adventures in Wonderland, and of classic horror movies I grew up loving.Henry Selick does a top notch job directing this movie, which pulls you in quickly and takes you on a spooky and colorful ride. Certain things will stand out for you, as they did for me: the opening credits sequence which shows scenes of the Other Mother creating the doll... the enchanting and gorgeous garden in the Other World... the audience of black Scottish Terriers watching Ms. Spink and Ms. Forcible's show... and the emotional core of the story, too.Part of the pleasure for someone who has read the book is seeing these scenarios that were previously only within one's imagination; now they come to life on screen almost magically, and it's the next best thing to revisiting the book.I didn't mind that the setting was changed from England to America; I guess Hollywood still thinks we can't handle that so much. No big thing. I thought the addition of the Wyborn character actually worked well in the story; In the book, Coraline talks to herself a great deal, and I suppose that does not work well on film, so they added a character to help with exposition and to help Coraline in her quest.All in all, this movie is a winner.",4,A Delightfully Dark and Imaginative Fantasy Film,1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,2818,"['4', 'stars', '[', 'First', 'brief', 'warning', 'faint', 'heart', 'should', 'steer', 'clear', 'kiddies', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'frightened', 'disturbed', 'enchanted', 'avoid', 'Coraline', 'costs', 'Let', 'just', 'get', 'way', 'move', 'on.Now', 'who', 'thrive', 'dark', 'delightfully', 'creepy', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'right', 'alley', 'First', 'fell', 'love', 'story', 'as', 'soon', 'plunged', 'book', 'wonderful', 'British', 'storyteller', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'who', 'cemented', 'icon', 'world', 'fantasy', 'am', 'ardent', 'fan', 'children', 'fantasy', 'tales', 'horror', 'things', 'British', 'so', 'was', 'charmed', 'hilt', 'dark', 'wondrous', 'tale', 'now', 'fanastic', 'movie', 'enjoy.This', 'stop-motion', 'movie', 'book', 'justice', 'totally', 'character', 'designs', 'sets', 'lighting', 'cinematography', 'lovely', 'musical', 'score', 'everything', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'work', 'went', 'movie', 'plenty', 'here', 'entertain', 'everyone', 'enough', 'peril', 'danger', 'scary', 'stuff', 'satisfy', 'folks', 'who', 'enjoy', 'good', 'villain', 'macabre', 'trappings', 'Maybe', 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'things', 'creepy', 'appreciate', 'Coraline', 'just', 'happen', 'love', 'scary', 'films', 'fiction', 'ideas.The', 'character', 'voices', 'are', 'terrific', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'very', 'effective', 'Other', 'Mother', 'real', 'mother', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Dawn', 'French', 'Jennifer', 'Saunders', 'contribute', 'quite', 'nicely.If', 'family', 'have', 'penchant', 'fantasy', 'horror', ""'re"", 'animation', 'better', 'best', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'tales', 'Alice', 'wild', 'adventures', 'Wonderland', 'classic', 'horror', 'movies', 'grew', 'up', 'loving.Henry', 'Selick', 'top', 'notch', 'job', 'directing', 'movie', 'quickly', 'spooky', 'colorful', 'ride', 'Certain', 'things', 'will', 'stand', 'out', 'did', 'opening', 'credits', 'sequence', 'scenes', 'Other', 'Mother', 'creating', 'doll', 'enchanting', 'gorgeous', 'garden', 'Other', 'World', 'audience', 'black', 'Scottish', 'Terriers', 'watching', 'Ms.', 'Spink', 'Ms.', 'Forcible', 'show', 'emotional', 'core', 'story', 'too.Part', 'pleasure', 'someone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'seeing', 'scenarios', 'were', 'previously', 'only', 'one', 'imagination', 'now', 'come', 'life', 'screen', 'almost', 'magically', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'revisiting', 'book.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'setting', 'was', 'changed', 'England', 'America', 'guess', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'so', 'much', 'big', 'thing', 'thought', 'addition', 'Wyborn', 'character', 'actually', 'worked', 'well', 'story', 'book', 'Coraline', 'talks', 'herself', 'great', 'deal', 'suppose', 'not', 'work', 'well', 'film', 'added', 'character', 'help', 'exposition', 'help', 'Coraline', 'quest.All', 'movie', 'winner']",N/A

Unfortunately my busy scehdule prevented me from getting to see it and oh how I regret it. Coraline, directed by Henry Selick (of Nightmare Before Christmas, and James and the Giant Peach fame)is an amazing journey of one lonely, misunderstood, and grossly ignored young lady, who find's everything she's ever wanted in ""Other World."" ""Other World"" is a mirror image of our own world that Coraline finds one night behind a wallpapered door, that had been bricked up when che discovered it earlier in the day. In this world there are ""Other"" versions of all the people she has just recently known, except with one difference, they are overly attentive to Coraline (even getting her name right, which no one , save for her parents can get right), and they all have black buttons for eyes. That is the first hint that something is very wrong with this place. But ""Other Mother"" is very convincing with her sweet personality, and amazing cooking abilities.It isn't long that Coraline finds out exactly whats going on and the journey takes a rather dark turn, with dark parodies of the entertaining beings the ""others"" once were. Henry Selick is a stop motion GOD, and he trully excelled here. This film surpasses his past efforts, with a story based on the superbly talented Neil Gaiman, it's an instant classic.HOWEVER this movie is NOT for little children. You know your kids best, but this movie has some really disturbing imagery, and the Button eyes are the least of it.Finally the 3D version really pops. I personally have never been a fan of 3D as it utes the colors too much except for a few (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow), but wow do the colors that show glow. And let's not even start on the craziness of the effects. Needles, ramps, mice, cotton candy, and more come flying at you and it just gets better. Definitely a keeper.

Just a REALLY strange piece of animation.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.The soundtrack is fascinating.  In fact it might be one of the best soundtracks to an animated film ever.  It's seriously THAT good.  Okay, Dumbo probably wins the award for best ever soundtrack, but Coraline is definitely a runner-up.The music seriously reminds me of the mid 70's Canterbury scene involving progressive rock bands such as Hatfield and the North, Caravan and the Soft Machine.  Plus it's entirely melodic and just perfect.  I absolutely LOVE it.The storyline is pretty good too, though incredibly simple and adventurous.  Just how a storyline *should* be.  A young girl bored out of her mind because her parents are too busy to spend time with her goes on an adventure of a lifetime right in her own home (by going back and forth through a secret doorway in the wall).On the other side of the wall lies mirror images of her parents, but with buttons for eyes!  I kid you not, haha.

1255401,A29QM4M1KVTWVF,B00288KNJU,Bitter Bunny,"[0, 0]","First off, this is not a cartoon. I've seen many reviewers describe this as a cartoon and that is incorrect. Simply, a cartoon is a segment of many two-dimensional illustrated pieces of art placed together in an effort to give the illusion of motion. Coraline is built entirely in a 3d physical space with the use of models, set design pieces & real lighting using a technique called Stop Motion photography - characters are moved a fraction of an inch and a frame is shot on film (or digitally).Think of it as a diorama that acts like an alternate world where specific characters exist. As such, the breadth it takes, not to mention the patience of the artists, is a phenomenal endeavor. Stop Motion photography has been around for a long time now - Gumby, TV Christmas specials such as Rudolph - but you've never seen anything like this before.At first glance, one would associate Coraline with Tim Burton because of the design of the characters, the creepy atmosphere and the storyline but this film is actually directed by Henry Selick. I wish Selick would get more recognition - Selick also directed The Nightmare Before Christmas, from a story by Burton and lots of help from Burton and yet most people would swear Burton also wore the Director's hat. Selick also directed James & The Giant Peach so it's safe to say he has perfected the craft of stop motion with a spectacular team of artists, of course.The film is based on a book by Neil Gaiman and although it's faithful in tone and theme. The one major addition to the film is a character named Wybie - a sidekick of sorts to Coraline. Formats between books and films are different and some theories regarding this addition range between making the film longer to allowing Coraline (independent in spirit) to team up and rid the world of the witch (Other Mother).The story is beautiful and I personally recommend it to any parent with kids, more so any parents of girls because Coraline is a positive role model embodying strength. She pushes on through challenges becoming self-reliant and reaching maturity. And can you believe she does it all without breaking into song and dance??? Ha ha, okay - there is one character that breaks into song but it isn't Coraline.Regarding the creepy and horror factors - it's easy to slip into the magical world and believe this domain to be real. If your child is that impressionable and cannot differentiate reality from fantasy, then I suggest a viewing when they're older.  Having said that, kids are resilient and this is no more violent than the average action film kids are exposed to - there are no gun shootings, nobody explodes, no one falls into the engine of an airplane, etc. etc. If anything, Coraline facilitates an opportunity to have a discussion afterwards about the complications of growing up - if you want to turn Friday night into a lecture.The actors all turn in great performances and the music perfectly captures the many moods of the film. I watched the film in 3D at the theaters and although the colors were a bit muted, the 3d effect was dazzling! I can't comment on whether the home 3d effect is on par but the good news is that the 2D version stands on its own.If you liked The Nightmare Before Christmas, you will definitely enjoy Coraline. I also recommend the film ParaNorman and look forward to Selick's new film The Shadow King.

""Exactly what audience is this type of animated feature shooting for?"" I asked myself. And it's not an easily answered one. On the surface, Coraline is an children's adventure story; the story of a little girl exploring her surroundings and finding a kind of Tim Burton-esque rabbit hole leading to an alternate reality. But dig just a bit deeper and you hit a rather frightening layer closer to the truth behind what might be perceived as a kind of heaven and hell. But which is heaven and which is hell? These are the questions that linger throughout the film...Coraline's transplantation into a new home leads her to explore its surroundings. First bumping into Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr.,The Happening) she learns that their new house has a history. Death has lurked not far away and looking at the landscape one quickly gets a sense of foreboding. A black cat (voiced by Keith David,Crash) adds to this sense.Coraline's parents Mel (Teri Hatcher,The Dead Girl) and Charlie (John Hodgman) don't have much time for Coraline, as they are trying to meet a literary deadline. So Coraline is left to her own devices and soon discovers a doorway to a much happier, alternate reality. Trouble is everyone there has buttons for eyes. But why?The reality is rather frightening and ghostly. So this isn't something young kids are going to enjoy nor understand. But it does have appeal. And, dare I say, it has appeal on a more intellectual level, even though much of the story can be dissected rather easily. But what parts aren't can, and will, linger in your mind for some time.This isn'tWall-Eor some other cutesy Disney film. This is raw, unforgiving storytelling within a stop-motion animated feature with a clever design and nightmarish qualities. Think of it more along the lines ofThe Nightmare Before Christmasand you'll be closer, but not quite there.The dangers to Coraline seem real, not just physically but spiritually. And when you see Coraline's Other Mother and Father on the downside of the rabbit hole, you get a knot in the pit of your stomach that tells you everything may not turn out well for our heroine or her family and friends.The voice actors all do an admirable job with special nods to Teri Hatcher as both Mel and the Other Mother. Her digression into this dangerous character were well played. And a big thumbs up to Keith David as The Cat. His voice was PERFECT and you really can't tell who's side he's on ...if any.This is something to watch and ponder. But not with the kiddies.

In my humble opinion, this movie was shafted at the Oscars because it wasn't from Disney or Pixar and CORALINE, is a threat to the animated movie market that has been monopolized by Disney/Pixar for...ever. Yet, CORALINE stands by itself as the kind of movie that will change the landscape of animation in the years to come. It doesn't need the publicity to pull this off. It does it with its quality and its magic.Quiet simply, CORALINE is amazing. It may be slightly strange, and it may be slightly dark, but so was MONSTER HOUSE. It is a ghost/witch story for children. It may be slightly scary, but that is part of the fun of it.I first watched it with a group of adult friends, in 3D (FOCUS was nice enough to release the 3D version, regular blu-ray & dvd blu-ray with special features with their first release, not the special secret overpriced edition 6 months later like some companies), and found it mind-blowing.  It was the first time that I had seen a 3D movie, at home, actually work.So, my first inclination was that it was too scary for my 4-year old and probably too scary for my 9-year old. Yet, not soon after, the 9-year old asked for it and there they were, both of them, glued to the television like I had never seen. Most movies hold their attention for a while and they end up drawing or wrestling, yet CORALINE had them staring at the television the whole time, jaws open, floored.  Thirty minutes after it was over, they wanted to watch it again... and again... there they were, awe struck through the entire movie, just like I was.Coraline tells the story of a little girl who is feeling gilted by her parents who are too busy with their lives to pay her attention. So, when she finds a secret door that leads her to an alternate universe, with attentive, loving parents who give her floats for dinner, she is enticed to say goodbye to the real world and join her alternative universe where everyone has buttons for eyes.It's a classic that should be held in the same esteem and long-lasting category as Wizard of Oz and it will, at least in my home, be one of the most loved children movies of all time.",5,It wasn't the animated movie of the year...?,1270684800,"04 8, 2010",2010,2211,"['guess', 'holding', 'out', 'award', 'Animated', 'Movie', 'decade', 'humble', 'opinion', 'movie', 'was', 'shafted', 'Oscars', 'was', ""n't"", 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'CORALINE', 'threat', 'animated', 'movie', 'market', 'been', 'monopolized', 'Disney/Pixar', 'ever', 'CORALINE', 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'change', 'landscape', 'animation', 'years', 'come', ""n't"", 'need', 'publicity', 'pull', 'off', 'quality', 'magic.Quiet', 'simply', 'CORALINE', 'amazing', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'strange', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'dark', 'so', 'was', 'MONSTER', 'HOUSE', 'ghost/witch', 'story', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'slightly', 'scary', 'part', 'fun', 'it.I', 'first', 'watched', 'group', 'adult', 'friends', '3D', 'FOCUS', 'was', 'nice', 'enough', 'release', '3D', 'version', 'regular', 'blu-ray', 'dvd', 'blu-ray', 'special', 'features', 'first', 'release', 'not', 'special', 'secret', 'overpriced', 'edition', '6', 'months', 'later', 'companies', 'found', 'mind-blowing', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'seen', '3D', 'movie', 'home', 'actually', 'work.So', 'first', 'inclination', 'was', 'was', 'too', 'scary', '4-year', 'old', 'probably', 'too', 'scary', '9-year', 'old', 'not', 'soon', '9-year', 'old', 'asked', 'there', 'were', 'glued', 'television', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Most', 'movies', 'hold', 'attention', 'while', 'end', 'up', 'drawing', 'wrestling', 'yet', 'CORALINE', 'had', 'staring', 'television', 'whole', 'time', 'jaws', 'open', 'floored', 'Thirty', 'minutes', 'was', 'over', 'wanted', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'there', 'were', 'awe', 'struck', 'entire', 'movie', 'just', 'was.Coraline', 'story', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'feeling', 'gilted', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'lives', 'pay', 'attention', 'So', 'when', 'secret', 'door', 'alternate', 'universe', 'attentive', 'loving', 'parents', 'who', 'give', 'floats', 'dinner', 'enticed', 'say', 'goodbye', 'real', 'world', 'join', 'alternative', 'universe', 'where', 'everyone', 'buttons', 'eyes.It', 'classic', 'should', 'be', 'held', 'same', 'esteem', 'long-lasting', 'category', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'will', 'least', 'home', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'loved', 'children', 'movies', 'time']",N/A
1255418,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00288KNJU,Chris Pandolfi,"[26, 33]","""Coraline"" is a frighteningly beautiful fantasy, filled to the brim with delightfully bizarre visuals and one-of-a-kind characters. Some may say that it's too dark for young children, and indeed, it is, in essence, a family-friendly horror movie. But I suspect that most children will find it more dazzling than scary; through the painstaking but rewarding process of stop-motion animation, writer/director Henry Selick retains the essence of the original novel by Neil Gaiman, crafting a tale that's just creepy enough to thrill audiences without sending them running out of the theater. It's also presented in 3-D, although the process isn't as impressive as you might think it is. I stared at the screen through a pair of special glasses, and yet I never flinched or covered my eyes when something came at me from off the screen. No matter--dimension isn't important as long as a fun story is being told.With ""Coraline,"" we're once again invited to explore an alternate world hidden amongst our own, specifically within the walls of a house (Gaiman has tackled this subject before with films like ""Mirrormask"" and stories like ""The Wolves in the Walls""). In this case, the alternate world is a lot like ours, except it's better. That's exactly why it appeals to Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning), an adventurous young girl leading a very dull life. Her parents (voiced by Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) are too busy writing articles for a gardening catalogue to take any notice of her. She's surrounded by eccentric but boring neighbors in her new home, which was once a Victorian house but is now an apartment complex. There's nothing worth exploring inside or outside. Worst of all, she never feels as if anyone is listening to what she's saying. Maybe it would help if they didn't keep calling her Caroline.Then she discovers a small door hidden behind a wall of an old parlor, a door that covers a tube-like portal leading to the alternate version of our world. Things are so much more interesting there, including the people, who are reflections of the people in Coraline's world. There's one small physical difference: They all have black buttons instead of eyes. When we first see Coraline's Other Mother (also voiced by Teri Hatcher), we immediately sense that something sinister lurks behind that vacant, artificial stare; she's a little too sweet-natured, a little too accommodating. It's as if she wants Coraline to stay in this alternate world forever, not as a daughter, but as a prized possession. Coraline's suspicions are confirmed when the Other Mother hands her a box containing two black buttons, a spool of thread, and a needle.There comes a point when Coraline must not only rescue her real parents, who have been kidnapped, but also free the souls of three dead children, who have been imprisoned in the alternate world for who knows how long. With the help of a special green stone, Coraline will play a game with the Other Mother, a hide-and-go-seek game, a finding-things game. If she loses ... well, let's just say that losing won't be a good thing for her.Another fitting way to describe this film would be to call it a Good vs. Evil fable, where a wise but non-complacent hero battles it out with a malevolent force. Coraline is daring, but she certainly isn't fearless, which only makes her that much more relatable as a character. She even has to be helped at specific points, as seen when the local cat appears in the alternate world; we quickly learn that, once in this world, he has the ability to speak like a human, specifically in the voice of Keith David. (Is it the independent nature of cats that inspired Gaiman to make this character a bit haughty?)As with any good fantasy, ""Coraline"" features a number of side characters, each with a unique personality quirk. Coraline's downstairs neighbors are Miss Spink and Miss Forcible (voiced by Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French), former actresses who speak as if they were trying to be heard in the balcony section. I don't know whether or not it's unfortunate that we only see their Other selves giving a performance (to an audience primarily made up of Scottish terriers). Her upstairs neighbor is Mr. Bobinsky (voiced by Ian McShane), an eccentric circus performer who gets from point A to point B using only acrobatic poses. He claims to have a troupe of mice training for their next performance, although the only mice we see belong to the Other Mr. Bobinsky; the show they put on for Coraline is one of the film's best scenes.Finally, there's Wybie Lovat (voiced by Robert Bailey, Jr.), a boy not much older than Coraline. He's awkward and timid, always hunched over, always sneaking up on Coraline, forbidden from entering the apartment complex because of his grandmother. This character was not in Gaiman's novel, and truth be told, I'm not sure he was needed for the film. He and Coraline have a few interesting scenes together, but there's always the sense that the story would have been just fine without him. It certainly was when Gaiman wrote it. Be that as it may, ""Coraline"" is still a fantastic explosion of creativity, a haunting, vibrant fantasy teeming with visual goodies. It's a dark film--not unpleasantly dark, but dark nevertheless. It works in much the same way as a bedtime story, many of which hint at the possibility of bad things happening. You know your children better than I do, but keep in mind that many are more fascinated by the macabre than by the mundane.",4,Jeepers Creepers!

1255419,AN9J46667D80O,B00288KNJU,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[1, 2]","Coraline, the latest adaptation of a work by Neil Gaiman, has hit theatres. It tells the story of young girl who, along with her rather oblivious parents, has just recently moved to the Pink Palace Apartments in what appears to be Ashland, Oregon. She feels stifled and doesn't like the place, especially after she meets weird local boy Wybie.Her life becomes rather more interesting when she finds a portal to another world (climbing through something rather similar to a big, blue-purple vagina. I'm not judging, just reporting), where she meets her Other Mother and Other Father, both idealized versions of her parents with buttons for eyes. They lavish love and attention upon her and don't appear to want anything in return. Well, possibly her eyes.This is a weird little stop-motion animated movie with some of the best, most amazing visuals I've seen on film in a long time. One of the things I love about movies is their abilities to show me things I've never seen and on that level this film doesn't disappoint. The mouse circus alone is worth the price of admission. It's also got a good, if rather basic, plot and some great voice acting.The film has a brisk pace, and at no point was I looking at my watch, wondering when it would end. The sheer creativeness of what I was seeing up on the screen was enough to distract me from the few plot holes, though I did notice a couple points where it seemed like scenes were missing.But there was something kind of off about the film. I don't know what it was. It certainly felt somewhat incomplete, and the third act felt kind of rushed (basically, ""Go off on a quest!"" followed a few moments later by, ""Right, quest done!""). Despite that, it was a decent movie and I didn't feel my money was wasted, which is always a plus.One word of caution about the film. I would be careful on taking young kids to see it. There's some rather dark images here (like a few attempts at removing eyes), that might give kids some rather unhappy dreams. I'd not take anyone under about 8 or so without seeing it first to screen it.Also, I can't speak to the 3-D effects, since my theatre didn't show it in 3-D. I could tell where there were clearly moments that were supposed to be 3-D but weren't. I've a feeling it probably didn't add anything to the movie to see it in 3-D, though.So if you want a good time at a film where you'll see things you've never seen before, go to this. If you don't want that, hey, there's always Benjamin Button. At least you'll keep in the buttons theme.",4,"Beautiful to look at, but paper-thin plot",1243728000,"05 31, 2009",2009,2524,"['Coraline', 'latest', 'adaptation', 'work', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'hit', 'theatres', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'rather', 'oblivious', 'parents', 'just', 'recently', 'moved', 'Pink', 'Palace', 'Apartments', 'what', 'be', 'Ashland', 'Oregon', 'stifled', ""n't"", 'like', 'place', 'especially', 'weird', 'local', 'boy', 'Wybie.Her', 'life', 'rather', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'portal', 'world', 'climbing', 'something', 'rather', 'similar', 'big', 'blue-purple', 'vagina', ""'m"", 'not', 'judging', 'just', 'reporting', 'where', 'Other', 'Mother', 'Other', 'Father', 'idealized', 'versions', 'parents', 'buttons', 'eyes', 'lavish', 'love', 'attention', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'want', 'anything', 'return', 'Well', 'possibly', 'eyes.This', 'weird', 'little', 'stop-motion', 'animated', 'movie', 'best', 'most', 'amazing', 'visuals', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'One', 'things', 'love', 'movies', 'abilities', 'show', 'things', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'level', 'film', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'mouse', 'circus', 'alone', 'price', 'admission', 'also', 'got', 'good', 'rather', 'basic', 'plot', 'great', 'voice', 'acting.The', 'film', 'brisk', 'pace', 'point', 'was', 'looking', 'watch', 'wondering', 'when', 'would', 'end', 'sheer', 'creativeness', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'up', 'screen', 'was', 'enough', 'distract', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'did', 'notice', 'couple', 'points', 'where', 'seemed', 'scenes', 'were', 'missing.But', 'was', 'something', 'kind', 'off', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'certainly', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'incomplete', 'third', 'act', 'felt', 'kind', 'rushed', 'basically', 'Go', 'off', 'quest', 'followed', 'few', 'moments', 'later', 'Right', 'quest', 'done', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'money', 'was', 'wasted', 'always', 'plus.One', 'word', 'caution', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'careful', 'taking', 'young', 'kids', 'see', 'rather', 'dark', 'images', 'here', 'few', 'attempts', 'removing', 'eyes', 'might', 'give', 'kids', 'rather', 'unhappy', 'dreams', ""'d"", 'not', 'take', 'anyone', '8', 'so', 'seeing', 'first', 'screen', 'it.Also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', '3-D', 'effects', 'theatre', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', '3-D', 'could', 'tell', 'where', 'were', 'clearly', 'moments', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', '3-D', 'were', ""n't"", ""'ve"", 'feeling', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'movie', 'see', '3-D', 'though.So', 'want', 'good', 'time', 'film', 'where', ""'ll"", 'see', 'things', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hey', 'always', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'least', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'buttons', 'theme']",N/A

Coraline is an entertaining and quirky film that tells the tale of a young girl who just moved in to a new apartment with her parents.  However, this isn't just any apartment.  Coraline, being the independent, headstrong girl that she is, finds a small doorway that leads to a parallel universe, and after she ventures inside things get really odd.The blu-ray version of the film looks very good.  The amount of detail and color saturation is fantastic.  I don't think it looks quite as good as Corpse Bride, but it's about on par with The Nightmare Before Christmas.  The 3-D version of the film is fun to look at, for a while.  I couldn't watch the whole movie in 3-D because the included glasses were a strain on my eyes.  It does work though, and it's a novel addition to the package you're getting.  I just won't be watching the entire film that way.As a film, Coraline mostly works.  It's an interesting story, but it didn't totally grab me.  Perhaps children will get more out of it than I did.  I'm not sure it would be a good film for very young children (4 or 5 years old) to watch as some of the images could be scary.

Both her parents are far too busy to pay much attention to her; she misses her friends back home; and the young boy who lives next door is a real pest.  The only solace she finds in her new apartment is a strange door that appears to be bricked up...until the sun goes down.  For that's when Caroline gets to go visit her Other Mother, a gracious woman who has all the time in the world for her beloved daughter.  There's just one little hitch: Coraline's Other Mother wants her to stay...forever.""Coraline"" is from the mind of Neil Gaiman, so you know it's going to be twisted and disturbing.  And it is; this is one of the more frightening family films ever made.  The imagery is surprisingly horrific; perhaps smaller children won't pick up on the subtleties, but their parents certainly will.  The voice cast, featuring supporting roles by Terri Hatcher, John Hodgman, Keith David, and Ian McShane, helps create an atmosphere of spine-tingling suspense.  The real standout, though, is Dakota Fanning.  In previous film roles, she's been precocious and downright annoying; remember ""War of the Worlds""?  No?  Well, sorry for reminding you.  But here she's fantastic; she does what many voice-over artists fail to do: lend her animated character real life, real personality.The overall effect of ""Coraline"" can be a bit numbing (I only gave the film 4 stars because, near the middle, it sags a bit, once the wonder has worn off).  Maybe it's different in 3D; I haven't jumped on that bandwagon yet.  (By the way, the DVD--and presumably Blu-ray--comes with both the 2D and 3D version of the film, so you can experience the movie both ways if you prefer.)  However, this is certainly a film you should watch if love a good old fashion Grimm's fairy tale.

1255434,AIMGHPI1AGVRF,B00288KNJU,Davewise,"[2, 3]","""Coraline"" is rather witty and very charming, yet also creepy at the same time. The story is about a girl - Coraline, not Caroline - who dislikes her parents, as many kids her age do. She doesn't like the boy next door either, or his cat, but still she doesn't come across as a brat or anything like that. Soon after the family moves into their new house, she discovers a little door which leads to a parallel version of her world with parents which appear to be much better - they want to spend time with her, treat her nicer, and cook better food. However, these ""other"" parents have another noticeable difference - they have buttons for eyes. Coraline soon discovers the hidden horrors of the parallel world; it's some of these scenes that might not be good for the little kids due to how scary they can be.I watched the movie in 3-D wearing the glasses included and while there were many scenes with things standing out, I think next time I'd rather watch the 2-D version. The colors obviously weren't the same and the effects didn't quite grab me enough. I don't think you can go wrong either way though. One of the amazing things about the movie is the effort which went into its making. The ""making of"" shorts included on the disc were very interesting, showing just how much work goes into a stop-motion movie and how they hand-made everything for this film.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of ""Coraline,"" brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous ""other"" world.Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring. The one exception is Wybie, a boy who annoys her no end.It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a plastered-up door and a colourful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger of new home. In fact, it's so similar that she has a button-eyed ""other mother"" (Teri Hatcher) and matching ""other father,"" (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a shimmering magic garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys.At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real ones aren't. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.Neil Gaiman's book ""Coraline"" is a brilliant dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children, spiderwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and an insectile button-eyed woman who wants to claim Coraline for herself. It's a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrific things scuttle in the shadows.Most directors would turn the story into a cutsy, unscary affair... but not the director of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach."" Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it's full of lovely details that could have been silly (the creepy-crawly claw hand) yet work brilliantly.The story starts off as merely surreal, but grows more ghastly and eerie as the movie unwinds -- and in the last third, the slow-moving story suddenly spins into a thoroughly spooky territory, and a truly terrifying climax where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully creepy moments -- the three ghosts in a rotting bedroom/mirror, the offering of buttons and thick black thread, weird circus acts, and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not.Coraline -- the Alice in this Notsowonderland -- is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her.

1255450,A1TOH8S8I1VT9R,B00288KNJU,"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real""","[30, 39]","As a big fan of stop-motion animation (using physical objects), any time a stop-motion film gets wide distribution I celebrate.  Simply put, stop-motion animation is my favorite film making medium.  I did it as a kid and I appreciate its unique place in the world of film art today.  Unlike 2d cell animation (Disney style), 3d stop-motion animation seams to be finding a place in the computer driven world of feature films.  Though not specifically advancing the art of stop-motion animation, Coraline dutifully keeps it alive for all the right reasons.WARNING: RISK OF SEVERE GEEK JUICING BEYOND THIS POINT!!!  PLEASE WEAR EYE PROTECTION!!STOP-MOTION = CREEPYIf you want a fantasy to be creepy, inject a little stop-motion and you will be successful.  If you look back at prominent films that employ Stop-motion it becomes clear: Corps Bride, Nightmare before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, Wallace and Gromit, the Curse of the Were Rabbit, Chicken Run and everything Ray Harryhausen did.  Stop-motion usually equates to creepy or fantastic.  Most fans of the technique would agree that it's the slightly jerky and awkward movements that contribute to the surreal and eerie feel that is so effective in these films.  ""Coraline"" is a very creepy film and even more so for employing stop-motion.TAKING A STEP BACK FROM ""CORPSE BRIDE""In my humble opinion ""Corpse Bride"" was the best feature film done entirely in stop-motion.  As the first film to use digital still cameras to animate 3d objects, ""Corpse Bride"" set the standard for character expression, meaningful movement and Stop-motion artistry.  ""Coraline"" takes a slight step back from ""Corpse Bride"" in its animation technique.  Things don't move quite as smoothly.  Characters don't have the same sense of weight or expressiveness.  All of that aside, ""Coraline"" is still an excellent piece of art and I enjoyed watching it despite not meeting ""Corpse Bride"" standards.MOVING A STEP AHEAD OF ""CORPSE BIRDE""Where ""Coraline"" advances the art of film making may not be in stop motion particularly, but rather in its hybrid technique use.  ""Coraline"" may well be the first film to combine stop-motion with CGI and very effectively in my opinion.  Many people revile CGI due to over-reliance on it by many in the film industry.  Very often films start to look like video games.  In ""Coraline"" CGI is used strictly as a background device.  Some might call this ""cheating"", but I can't imagine how this film could be achieved as effectively without it.  As much as I love stop-motion, CGI has its place and this was a creative place to use it.ACTORS WHO DON'T SING""Coraline"" is unique for a stop-motion film in that there are no extraneous musical numbers in the place of conversation.  That does not mean there is no music at all, it just means that the music occurs when it might in reality:  While someone plays the piano, in a theater, and at the Circus.  I was taken aback when the characters broke out in song during ""Corpse Bride"".  I never expected it and it took a couple of viewings to get used to it.  In Coraline the music was natural and unobtrusive.  Though I've never heard Dakota Fanning (Coraline) or Teri Hatcher (Mom 1 and Mom 2) sing, I'm not disappointed I haven't yet.  They both did excellent work here with Hatcher being the surprise of the day.  She personally made the ""Stepford Wives"" look downright inviting.  I don't want to take the time to talk about all the actors, though I should mention all involved make significant contributions.WHAT ABOUT THE STORY ""GEEK-MIAS""?I enjoyed the story quite a bit.  The question is, will you?  Here's how my family received this film.WIFE:  she doesn't like being reminded of her own mortality, so she was not too thrilled with a story that has dead children in it.  She thought the movie was ok but didn't like the subject matter.SON:  as a sensitive 6 year old, he was somewhat frightened by it.  He liked the format and the fantasy, but was less than thrilled with the bugs and scary stuff, same as my wife.DAUGHTER:  She liked it.  As a 10 year old, she related a lot to Coraline because she's close to the same age and has awful parents just like Coraline... ...wait, did I say that?  Regardless, I've raised her to enjoy scary stuff so she was with it.  She thoroughly enjoyed it.ME:  I love stop-motion and the story was original enough to keep me guessing.  There were dead children, so peril was well established.  There are plenty of quirky (crazy) characters and plenty of creepy stuff too, so I was well satisfied.THE 4 YEAR OLD SITTING NEXT TO ME:  ""Mommy, I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE THAT AGAIN!!""  I guess she didn't like it.  That warmed my heart.LIKE THE CHILDREN OF ""HAMLIN"", I'M HOOKEDThough not reaching the heights that ""Corpse Bride"" did, ""Coraline"" immediately went on my DVD wish-list after leaving the theater.  Seeing it in 3D was really not important and actually a distraction.  Seeing it without the glasses is fine.  The story is dark like many fairy tales and harkens back to the ""Pied Piper of Hamlin"" which creeped me out as a kid, so your kids might be a little disturbed.

1255451,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B00288KNJU,Elisabeth,"[1, 3]","This movie has a slow start, but picks up steam once the main character, Coraline, discovers a small portal into another dimension at her new house. That other dimension looks exactly like the world Coraline lives in now, except the people there have buttons for eyes.But an even more important difference about this other dimension is that all the people there cater exclusively to Coraline's ego by making her the center of attention.  This treatment is in stark contrast to her real world where her distracted parents treat her like a pest.  It's no surprise then that Coraline becomes seduced by all this flattery.But like the saying goes, just because the grass looks greener on the other side doesn't mean it really is. Coraline learns the hard way that if someone is pouring on the flattery, they usually have an agenda.  Heck, there are grown adults who still need to learn this lesson.I enjoyed watching this movie, but the reason I only gave it 4 stars was because I was confused about which age bracket this is targeted for.  The lessons here would be good for kids to learn, but there are some scenes that are too adult for kids to watch. The first is the opening scene with a doll that's kind of scary.

1255468,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B00288KNJU,Gryphonisle,"[5, 7]","I loved seeing this movie in the theater with digital 3D, but the old fashioned green/orange version you get with this DVD wipes out the color and did little to enhance the film with the feeble 3d effects that were provided.  If it makes a difference, I watched it on a large flat screen monitor.  So, the bad news out of the way, the movie was great.The film is creepy in the halloween aesthetic so favored by Tim Burton, but done here with a bit less of the macabre than in ""Nightmare Before Christmas"".  The ""other mother"" turns out to be a spidery creature with the typical Burtonesque mechanical hinged hands, and rag dolls populate the ""other world"", and when they are dispatched, they don't bleed, they lose sand.  The film is set in Oregon, and to a point manages to suggest a bit of the misty romance of the western part of that soggy, mountainous state.  But for all the sets and effects, it's the story that carries this film.  And the story, despite the near relentless gloom and creep, is quite positive.  A lonely girl, transplanted from Detroit (where you would think she would have at least some relief at having escaped) to the Oregon countryside by her self employed, and self absorbed writer parents, finds a secret door to a mirror-image apartment, and a mirror image family that is everything hers isn't, including not real and very dangerous.  It seems the ""other mother"" also referred to in the film as ""the beldam"" an archaic word for an old hag (although she hasn't that characteristic at all) creates a fantasy world to draw children to her, then she sews buttons on their eyes (they don't go into detail on this) and locks them behind a mirror where she eats their life (or their soul, the film says life, which seems odd).Along comes Coraline who, unlike the three other kids who fell afoul of the beldam, decides she's not that lonely, and fights back.  Given all the time and energy it took to get to that point, the film resolves itself a bit too quickly from there, for my tastes, but it does it so well; a nice bit of chocolate or fine cheese that was portioned a bit too small, and there isn't any more as you find out afterwards...  The thing about the two worlds in this film, is that it isn't just Coraline's family that gets the treatment.  The old Russian acrobat upstairs and the two burlesque performers downstairs also have star turns in the ""other world"" that really delight the viewer.  I managed to find a review on a ""family"" website that was very good, until it got to the nudity part...  I'll mention that because they did, as apparently it's an issue for some people.  In the burlesque scene, in a vaudeville theater that the ladies apartment becomes in the ""other world"" they do what they did when they were younger, except that now they're not, and they're very, very out of shape, but you do have two stop-animation figures cavorting about in a vaudeville burlesque routine about mermaids and sirens, and one of them is but for the saving graces of glittering pasties and g-strings all but naked.  And then, the women materialize in their more youthful form, in show-nothing one piece bathing suits that would have made Mr. Hayes proud, and there you are.  I'd hate to think I ruined your day if I led you into a purchase that has partial stop animation nudity among the clay-rines.So, I heartily recommend the film, and just as heartily suggest you watch the 2D version as it seems to be enhanced (ala ""Roger Rabbit"") such that it has greater depth without having 3D.  The 3D, in the theater, was not so much the hatchet flying off the screen variety of old, but added a degree of depth and realism to the story.  I wonder if one brought home the glasses from the theater, one would have better results with the 3D here?

1255473,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00288KNJU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 3]","To be honest, Neil Gaiman's novel left me a bit cold and not at all invested in the lead character of Coraline. This is one of those pretty rare instances in which I prefer the film adaptation to the original literary source. Because Coraline may still be not be as endearing as Dorothy Gale or Pippi Longstocking or even Helena fromMirrormask(also written by Gaiman), but at least the stop-motion animation looks absolutely cool and bizarre. CORALINE the film conveys the same uneasy and feverish vibe that was so palpable in the book, and I wouldn't be at all surprised that little kids upon seeing this movie end up with nightmares. The quick premise breakdown: a lonely little girl wanders thru a hidden door and finds a better version of her life. But is it really a better version?The sense I got is that her parents are so distracted and neglectful that they couldn't even work up the energy to give her a proper name. Michigan girl Coraline Jones with her blue hair and her folks have just now moved into the Pink Palace Apartments and she doesn't waste time in exploring her new home. And what an odd home it is. Coraline soon runs into fellow tenants, an acrobatic foreign old gent perfecting a mice act and two seriously dog-loving old spinsters dwelling in the basement apartment. There's a mangy cat who knows more than it lets on. And then there's that peculiar door that's been painted over... and we know, don't we, that it won't take long at all before Coraline finds out what's on the other side of that door?What she finds on the other side is a spooky length of tunnel which leads into a fantastic alternate world, and this world apes Coraline's new digs. But what's disturbing is that Coraline promptly encounters creepy mimics of her parents and neighbors. Instead of immediately perturbed, Coraline is instead equally bemused and enchanted because this set of parents, this Other Mother and Other Father, is fun and caring and attentive, showering Coraline with love and mouth-watering dishes and treating her to marvelous magical sights. Except that these parents have buttons sewn into their eye sockets. And then Coraline runs into warped counterparts of her real world neighbors, and even a version of that annoying kid Wybie (short for Wyborn). But everything seems so perfect and idyllic in this other dimension, and Coraline is so gratified to be the center of attention for once that she dismisses the worrying fact that people in this place HAVE FRIGGIN' BUTTONS FOR EYES! Inevitably, though, the doubts start to set in. And if she's not careful, Coraline may find herself forever trapped on the wrong side of the door.Henry Selick, director of CORALINE, also directedThe Nightmare Before Christmas (2-Disc Collector's Edition + Digital Copy), and don't be surprised at how similar these two films are in terms of the surreal and exaggerated and unsettling animation. I dunno, to me, there's just something so fundamentally disquieting and macabre about people with buttons for eyes. The film also features wistful ghosts of dead children, victims of the Other Mother. And adding to the colorful parade of grotesque, we learn that the two nice old ladies, as nice as they are, tend to stuff their dead pets.It took a while for me to warm up to Coraline Jones. She's a little mean and peevish, and she's not too nice to that kid Wybie. But she did win me over in the end as she demonstrates gumption when things take an alarming turn, and it doesn't hurt that Dakota Fanning provides the vocal talent. Meanwhile, Teri Hatcher does double duty as the Other Mother and also Coraline's real mom. CORALINE may not leave you feeling warm and fuzzy - in fact, it may throw you off your comfort zone - but it's certainly worth watching, for its memorable twisty visuals and its spindly, wildly imaginative characters.

1255474,A3W2UTN0BC4ZKD,B00288KNJU,"Heath Buckmaster ""_heath_""","[1, 2]","When the movie started my first thought was - Tim Burton. The feel of the creatures, characters, effects, set, etc. was very reminiscent of Nightmare Before Christmas and the like - and seriously, the darkness that comes out in Coraline has a similar feel.PLOT: Coraline (not Caroline as many characters try to call her) finds herself in a rented home with a mysteriously secret door in the wall that leads to a parallel world - a parallel world that is dark and devilish. It's also a parallel world where everyone's eyes are buttons. Don't ask me why they are buttons - that was one of the mysteries of the movie that I never understood.Coraline must first figure out what is ""wrong"" in the parallel world, then figure out how to fix it, or perhaps get back to the safety and potential boredom of ""reality"".CHARACTERS: My favourite character was the cat. The creature was elegant, playful, offered both comic relief and insight, and was simply fun to watch. The animators spent a lot of time on that one and it was well worth it. Coraline was an interesting one - I didn't like her at first because I found her voice and her personality a bit irritating - but as the movie progressed and she discovered new things and grew, I found myself liking her more...even her wild blue hair. As for the other characters you will find a few women with VERY exaggerated breasts. It's not done in a sexual manner so you don't need to worry for kids, but it's very humorous (and you'll recognize the voices of Jennifer Saunders & Dawn French).ANIMATION: Superb, simply superb. The colours were vibrant and rich, the detail was amazing in even the smallest detail like a cat's whisker. Very impressive and stunning - as I said before, the cat was really quite cool.OVERALL RATING: I'm giving the movie 5 stars. My initial dislike of Coraline went away quickly, the detailed animation and very well written story made for a delightful evening. Even the minor issue of me not fully understanding the concept of the button eyes does not detract from the movie.

1255485,A26O0T192IBKY1,B00288KNJU,J. Alford,"[1, 3]","Yet another movie based on the works of comic god Neil Gaiman(sorry, no Sandman yet), this stop-motion animated film was directed by Henry Selick, whose former works include The Nightmare Before Christmas and James And The Giant Peach. It was one of the few movies that he acted alone from Tim Burton from, but was much more successful than his bomb of Monkeybone. Gaiman's book Coraline was largely inspired by Alice In Wonderland, and I'd have say that this film made for a better fantasy/suspense movie for kids that the recent Tim Burton one.Set in an apartment home in the midwest, Coraline is a bored girl whose family has recently moved into the old estate. After leaving all her friends behind from her former town, she finds her new crib to be slightly off. There's strange neighbors, an enigmatic stray cat, a chatty boy named Wybee(short for Wyborne)and a mysterious door in her living room which leads to a brick wall. One night, Coraline follows a mouse throught the door which leads to an alternate version of her house called the Other World. There, she encounters her Other Mother who runs it, who appears to be a friendlier doppleganger of her real mother. She cooks her lavish breakfast/dinners, introduces her to more entertaining versions of her already eccentric neighbors, and a silent copy of Wybee. However, Coraline soon realizes that this is all an elaborate trap, mainly because the cat in the Other World can talk and warns her. After O.M. tells her that can stay in this world forever as long as she gives up her eyes, Coraline runs away, but gets imprisioned with the ghosts of three other children that had given their souls to Other Mother, who is revealed to be a bedlam. As an extra insentive to get Coraline, she kidnaps her parents. The cat tells her to trick the bedlam into a game, so that she can free her parents and the ghost children. After facing the rather twisted residents of this nightmare as it unfolds around her, she has a final confrontation with Other Mother in her web. Coraline escapes, but the bedlam's hand makes it through to our side. Wybee helps bury the hand in a deep well, and then Coraline has a big garden party with the ""real"" members of her apartment building.This was an exceptionally creepy movie, but in a good way. Henry Selick manages to make this a hauntingly great experience, and definately not one for toddlers to see before hitting the hay.

Wilkerson,"[2, 3]","After Coraline (Dakota Fanning) and her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) move to the Pink Palace Apartments, Coraline becomes frustrated by her lack of friends and her parents not paying attention to her as they work on their gardening catalog. When she runs into her neighbor Wybie (Robert Bailee Jr.), he gives her a doll he found in his grandmother's house that looks just like her. Shortly after receiving the doll Coraline finds a small door in the wall of their apartment that opens up to a brick wall. But later that night jumping mice who seemingly belong to upstairs neighbor, The Amazing Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane), lead her back to the door where she finds an alternate world where her parents treat her like she longs to be treated. Each night she revisits this wonderful world only to eventually find out that it's not all it's cracked up to be.It's often a preconceived misconception that Tim Burton directed A Nightmare Before Christmas. As much as Burton wanted to direct Nightmare, he was unfortunately too busy working on Batman Returns, and was forced to place Henry Selick in the director's chair. Since then, A Nightmare Before Christmas has become a classic, being played every year in limited release around the country. This time Selick takes on Neil Gaiman. Neil Gaiman has become a much revered science fiction/ fantasy writer having written such work as the novel Stardust, which was turned into a movie in 2007, and the comic book series The Sandman as well as Coraline. Writing stories that are uniquely original with his comics including visuals that are stunning and unique in their own right, Gaiman is the perfect writer to bring to the big screen. And if you're considering using stop motion animation there are few directors other than Selick that one can think of to bring Gaiman's work to the big screen with it's integrity intact.After seeing Coraline, I have to say that I can't think of any other filmmaker other than Tim Burton that could have done this movie justice. The attention to detail, as it was with Nightmare, is meticulous. I generally have a little problem with not being able to completely escape reality when watching a stop-motion animation film, but with Coraline I didn't have much of a problem with that. With too much of this style of animation the director seems scared to make things dirty, gritty, and real, but Selick doesn't seem to have that much of a problem in this movie. That really aids this film as the real world Coraline lives in is a gritty world to her as opposed to the alternate reality she visits and, at first, prefers to her real life. The writing is, for the most part, impeccable despite a few clunky lines, crafting a unique story with characters that you feel for and are compelled to root for when their situations go awry.Of course, with any animated movie the characters are only as good as the people who voice them. Here you have some great actors such as Dakota Fanning (War of the Worlds, Man on Fire, I Am Sam), Keith David (Crash, Requiem for a Dream, Pitch Black), and Ian McShane (Deadwood, Kings, Sexy Beast). The voice actor that really stands out, though, is Teri Hatcher as Coraline's mother Mel Jones. As Mel Jones, Teri Hatcher doesn't just play the real world mother, but also the alternate mother creating a world for Coraline, luring her in to steal her soul. As Mel, Hatcher really makes you feel both sides of the coin of the character. She makes you feel that the alternate mother is the best fit for Coraline, but when you find out the truth she makes you despise the other mother and feel for the mother that you at first despised. This mixture of emotions for one actress to make you convey shows the brilliance of the performance as well as the visuals used by the filmmakers in the story.Unfortunately though, later in the movie as Coraline searches for her parents and the souls of lost children the movie devolves into what feels like video game mode. The souls of the lost children speak to her as though she's a character played by the the director rather than feeling like an organic transition. This could have been a conscious decision by the filmmakers but it feels a little gimmicky. When I got to what I thought was going to be the end of the game that the other mother was playing with Coraline I honestly felt like I was playing a game of something like Mario approaching Bowser for the final battle. That would be great if I was playing Mario, but I don't want to be taken out of a movie with the feeling that I'm playing a game that I'm not really playing.In the end though, I fell in love with the world and plight of Coraline. I'm still not sure if I will own it, but I think it would hold up greatly in repeated viewings. I do recommend this movie, especially if you like stop motion animation, The Nightmare Before Christmas, or somewhat gothic styles movies. Selick did a great job of translating a Gaiman classic to the big screen creating a unique and original film. Before you show the kids I highly recommend that you watch it yourself. While this may be stop motion animation there are scenes that may be scarier than you'd like your kids to experience and one scene of an older woman in extremely skimpy clothing.4/5",4,Coraline,1263686400,"01 17, 2010",2010,5261,"['Coraline', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'parents', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'John', 'Hodgman', 'move', 'Pink', 'Palace', 'Apartments', 'Coraline',

This other place has a house similar to her real one and a mother/father that look like her real parents, but things aren't quite right; the house is too beautiful and perfect, the ""parents"" are too loving, and all the people in this world have buttons instead of eyes.  Her new ""other mother"" wants her to stay in this perfect world forever.  Then things get spooky.I haven't read the book by Neil Gaiman, who's a terrific author, but I thoroughly enjoyed this creepy movie.  The portrayal of the ""other place"" is just right: at first it looks beautiful and enchanting, but things just start getting a little wrong and wronger.  The other tenants (the country house is split into apartments) are terrific characters; the theater performance of the old ladies in the basement is a scream.The movie was done in 3D stop-motion animation, and it's the best I've seen.  The settings are so colorful and imaginative that for a while I thought it was computer-generated animation designed to LOOK like stop-motion.  The blu-ray includes both a 2D and 3D version (with the 3D glasses), but I haven't looked at the 3D yet.  Home theaters can't replicate the same 3D technology used in theaters so instead they do the ol' red/green glasses thing.  This REALLY screws up the colors which would be a shame in this very colorful movie.

1255499,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00288KNJU,John F. Rooney,"[1, 3]","Don't worry about losing your buttons, worry about losing your eyes and having them replaced by buttons. Admittedly ""Coraline"" is not my cup of tea; I found it overly long, repetitive, and too downbeat, but I appreciated the brilliance, cleverness, originality, innovativeness, and great imaginative leaps taken in the movie. It has a touch of theater of the absurd, but also it had a touch of the Grimm Brothers' grim fairy tales.The stop action photography used is fantastic.You're never sure whether you are in a dream world or not because key things happen right after Coraline goes to bed.Having your eyes removed and buttons sewn on is the worst thing that can happen to you in ""Coraline"" because you thereby lose your soul. Coraline lives in a gloomy old house along with tenants in the basement and a tenant on the top floor. The basement tenants are two old ladies who apparently were vaudeville performers, and there is a fantasy scene in a theater where we see them scantily clad as a trapeze act. They are funny, eccentric characters, but seem to me to be aimed at an older, more sophisticated audience than one for the kiddies.There are all sorts of incredible creations (spooky spider things), and it is unquestionably a work of genius.The upper floor tenant is a circus performer who trains mice who performs in a circus tent scene. There's a talking feral cat and a nice kindly boy Coraline's age in the movie.Coraline's parents are self-absorbed yuppies who have no time for her. The mother never cooks a decent meal, and the father is too busy at his computer keyboard. Her second parents seem so nice, and the mother is a great cook (the corn on the cob looked delicious), but, as it turns out, they have buttons as surprises for her. Instead of losing her buttons, Coraline fears that she is going to lose her eyes and gain two control buttons that she doesn't want.This film has scary, creepy stuff, and a thematic melancholy that may be off-putting and tough sledding for young children. It's difficult to say who the audience is for this work. Kafka enthusiasts? Fans of Beckett, Genet, and Kurt Weill? Absurdists? Gloomy Guses?We see so much about dysfunctional families that we soon get to see the abnormal as the norm.

This DVD release has no extras on it other than narration by the director/music composer. Would like to have had some behind the scenes stuff.I know I'm late to see this, wasn't a big movie goer until recently. I loved Paranorman and heard good reviews of Coraline which was done by the same studio. Unfortunately I had watched some trailers (which I rarely do) so nothing in the movie was really a surprise. I can't say too much about why I don't like it that much, without giving out spoilers. I guess movies are a bit like relationships. You are either drawn to them or not and explaining why is often fruitless.Without giving away the story line, I felt they missed on charactor development. It was too cartoonish for me to really get drawn into the emotional drama. That is where I felt the difference in stop animation was between Coraline and Paranorman. In Paranorman, the charators were close enough to actual people that I could better relate to them. The best example of this in Coraline was Mr. B. A totally disproportionate character who had a line with 'um pa' in it that reminded me of 'um pa lume pa um pa te do' from 'Willie Wonka's Chocolate Factory'. Yes this ages me. Mr. B even had bluish/purple skin like the um pas.I was surprised when I read a reviewer's line somewhere that claimed this was one of the most imaginative films anywhere. The idea of souls being trapped when their bodies have no eyes comes from Native American Culture. I didn't feel anything in this movie was new. It felt very 'Walt Disney-ish to me.UPDATE 1/13/13Watched the movie a 3rd time and like it even less.Coraline is basically a brat, that always wants more and in this movie always get what see wants. Even at the end, her parents give her want she wanted. The other main thing going on, is the main male character, Coraline's friend is emasculated, which continues the trend in society. Coraline calls him names, (calls him ""why were you born"")beats on him and his body language shows he has low self esteem. I actually like movies with morals, but in this one, the brat gets her way and gets rewarded for being a brat. The entire world revolves around Coraline snd I think it is symptomatic of current society, in the way parents spoil their kids, yet it just makes the kids want more. Then being unhappy when they have everything you think anyone might need. Our tech society just creates addiction because social interaction is totally lacking. Not all that is in the movie, but this movie is disturbing, in a way that it never intended to be. The movie has no deep social interaction whatsoever, and no one even notices it missing.Great movie for someone who is morally bankrupt. I guess that explains its popularity in our society.",2,Reflects Our Narcissistic Society,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,2801,"[""'ll"", 'put', '1st', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', '1st', 'line', 'DVD', 'release', 'extras', 'other', 'narration', 'director/music', 'composer', 'Would', 'like', 'have', 'had', 'scenes', 'stuff.I', 'know', ""'m"", 'late', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'movie', 'goer', 'recently', 'loved', 'Paranorman', 'heard', 'good', 'reviews', 'Coraline', 'was', 'done', 'same', 'studio', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'watched', 'trailers', 'rarely', 'do', 'so', 'nothing', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'surprise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'that', 'much', 'giving', 'out', 'spoilers', 'guess', 'movies', 'are', 'bit', 'relationships', 'are', 'drawn', 'not', 'explaining', 'why', 'often', 'fruitless.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'story', 'line', 'felt', 'missed', 'charactor', 'development', 'was', 'too', 'cartoonish', 'really', 'get', 'drawn', 'emotional', 'drama', 'where', 'felt', 'difference', 'stop', 'animation', 'was', 'Coraline', 'Paranorman', 'Paranorman', 'charators', 'were', 'close', 'enough', 'actual', 'people', 'could', 'better', 'relate', 'best', 'example', 'Coraline', 'was', 'Mr.', 'B', 'A', 'totally', 'disproportionate', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'line', ""'um"", 'pa', 'reminded', ""'um"", 'pa', 'lume', 'pa', 'um', 'pa', 'te', 'do', ""'Willie"", 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'Yes', 'Mr.', 'B', 'even', 'had', 'bluish/purple', 'skin', 'um', 'pas.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'read', 'reviewer', 'line', 'somewhere', 'claimed', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'imaginative', 'films', 'anywhere', 'idea', 'souls', 'being', 'trapped', 'when', 'bodies', 'have', 'eyes', 'Native', 'American', 'Culture', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'movie', 'was', 'new', 'felt', 'very', ""'Walt"", 'Disney-ish', 'me.UPDATE', '1/13/13Watched', 'movie', '3rd', 'time', 'even', 'less.Coraline', 'basically', 'brat', 'always', 'more', 'movie', 'always', 'get', 'what', 'see', 'Even', 'end', 'parents', 'give', 'want', 'wanted', 'other', 'main', 'thing', 'going', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'Coraline', 'friend', 'emasculated', 'trend', 'society', 'Coraline', 'names', 'why', 'were', 'born', 'beats', 'body', 'language', 'low', 'self', 'esteem', 'actually', 'movies', 'morals', 'one', 'brat', 'way', 'rewarded', 'being', 'brat', 'entire', 'world', 'around', 'Coraline', 'snd', 'think', 'symptomatic', 'current', 'society', 'way', 'parents', 'spoil', 'kids', 'just', 'kids', 'want', 'more', 'Then', 'being', 'unhappy', 'when', 'have', 'everything', 'think', 'anyone', 'might', 'need', 'tech', 'society', 'just', 'addiction', 'social', 'interaction', 'totally', 'lacking', 'Not', 'movie', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'way', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'movie', 'deep', 'social', 'interaction', 'whatsoever', 'one', 'even', 'missing.Great', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'guess', 'popularity', 'society']",N/A
1255501,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B00288KNJU,John Kwok,"[1, 2]","Even in its two-dimensional version - which I saw recently - ""Coraline"" is an instant classic of cinematic animation, using time-honored stop-motion action cinemation. It's a classic fable of good versus evil, featuring a reluctant, almost insignificant, heroine triumphantly prevailing against the dark, sinister overlord of an alternate universe. Director Henry Selick has wrought wonders, working on this screen adaptation of Neil Gaiman's eerie teenage literature (with ample adult overtones) novel. His stop-motion action animation looks realistic, even after one remembers the excessively bright, almost unrealistic, colors of both outdoor gardens and house kitchens set in the ""Other"" universe. But he's also fortunate to have excellent acting from his cast, especially from young Dakota Fanning as the heroine, Coraline Jones, Teri Hatcher as her mother (and ""Other Mother""), and surprisingly, comedian/writer John Hodgman as Coraline's father (and ""Other Father"").Young Coraline Jones moves from Michigan with her parents - a pair of professional writers who write catalogs on plants and gardens - to a dilapidated old house set somewhere in Oregon. It's such a dull, dreary place, and poor Coraline is bored to tears with all the attention - or rather lack thereof - she receives from her parents, who are busy writing away, working on their respective deadlines. Until one night she discovers a mysterious door to a different reality, the ""Other"" universe and meets her ""Other"" parents, who are far more lively, personable, and caring. Or are they really?

The film is full of High Octane Nightmare Fuel and retired adult entertainment stars with naked elderly puppet breasts... come to think of it that is High Octane Nightmare Fuel as well.As for the adults in the audience, I fear that in my case the film was too distant. I never felt emotionally attached to our plucky protagonist. In part because she is not a very nice girl (nor terribly plucky now I think about it) and partially because the film seemed to place her and her predicament at a distance.On the other hand, I was floored by the sheer artistry of the film. Visually this is simply one of the most stunning films I have ever seen. Director Henry Selick who helmed such stop motion masterpieces as James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas has taken his art to a new level. Words simply cannot describe the visual delights that lie inside Coraline.While I found the story somewhat distancing I also recognize the depth of the tale. Coraline's two universes mirror each other in a complicated web rather than a simply black and white as one might expect. The ocean here may not be that wide but it is amazingly deep.

All Seems Fun Untill She Has To Have Black Buttons Sewed On For Eyes. Now Coraline Must Escape The Other World and Get Back To Her World, While Helping 3 Ghost Children Getting Thier Eyes Back.The Book The Movie is Based on Is Absolutly Great, and So Dose The Movie. Dokata Fanning (FromDr Seuss the Cat in the Hat (2003) (Full Dol)) Was Probably The Only Choice Thay Had and The Best Choice For The Voice of Coraline, and She Did A Great Job at It. All The Other Voice Are Great and Have The Most Great Voices To Make You Belive The Carecters Are Real.The 3D is Absolutly Brilliant and Belivable, Half The Time You Can't Even Tell You're Watching 3D.I Do Recommend Parents That Have Children Under 11 See The Film Themselves Before Brining Thier Children Seeing it.

There's Moment Were There is A Woman Almost Naked, Coraline Being Attacked and Thretened Most of The Middle of The Film, Among Others, and I'm Surprised The Film Didn't Get A PG-13.The Film is Directed By Henrey Selick (Director ofThe Nightmare Before Christmas, andMonkeybone) and This is Probley His Best Film He's Done Yet.

Coraline (2009) is one of my favorite animation films of all time. I totally dig its aesthetic style.I tend to like films that are not that popular -- granted that I watch films with a very critical eye, as I have a BA degree in Cinema. In other words, I'm not your average movie-goer.Even though Coraline's plot line gave me a deja vu -- it seems like I have seen similar stories before -- this film is still totally unique. One of its charms is its visual style: stop-motion animation -- which gives Coraline a 80s-cartoon look.The story itself has so many underlying (metaphysical) meanings. Thus, I wonder if the average viewer will grasp all the intricate and subtle layers of this visual masterpiece.Coraline definitely makes my list of top films of all time -- and that says a lot, since I rarely (very rarely) deem a movie worthy to do a review for.Coraline is an exceptional work of art.",5,I'm impressed!,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,1034,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'animation', 'films', 'think', 'films', 'are', 'usually', 'directed', 'youngsters', 'are', 'generally', 'more', 'mature', 'themes', 'Coraline', '2009', 'one', 'favorite', 'animation', 'films', 'time', 'totally', 'dig', 'aesthetic', 'style.I', 'tend', 'like', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'popular', 'granted', 'watch', 'films', 'very', 'critical', 'eye', 'have', 'BA', 'degree', 'Cinema', 'other', 'words', ""'m"", 'not', 'average', 'movie-goer.Even', 'Coraline', 'plot', 'line', 'gave', 'deja', 'vu', 'have', 'seen', 'similar', 'stories', 'film', 'still', 'totally', 'unique', 'One', 'charms', 'visual', 'style', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'Coraline', '80s-cartoon', 'look.The', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'underlying', 'metaphysical', 'meanings', 'Thus', 'wonder', 'average', 'viewer', 'will', 'grasp', 'intricate', 'subtle', 'layers', 'visual', 'masterpiece.Coraline', 'definitely', 'list', 'top', 'films', 'time', 'lot', 'rarely', 'very', 'rarely', 'deem', 'movie', 'worthy', 'do', 'review', 'for.Coraline', 'exceptional', 'work', 'art']",N/A

It was definitely different, and has that Tim Burton touch mixed with Hayao Miyazaki's style (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, etc - if you have not heard or seen any of Hayao Miyazaki's movies - check them out - AMAZING!). Some people say Coraline is ok for all ages, but it is not in my opinion. Even as an adult, there are parts of this movie that are very creepy, and leave lingering feelings or akwardwardness and chills. As mentioned in some of the other Reviews, there is a great moral tied to this movie. I bought the real 3D version, that requires an actual 3D Blu-Ray Player/Playstation 3 along with a 3D TV & Glasses. I enjoyed the 3D effects in this movie. In particular, there are parts that are beyond visually stunning.If you have not seen this movie, and like animated films with some edge, this is worth watching. Good voice acting, great animation/Quality Graphics, and really has both sides of a coin incorporated, where much of the movie is Dark Colors but then parts where there are incredibly vibrant colors and visually enticing moments of psychedelia, oh yeah!! It's not a 5 star movie in my opinion, but I give it 4 stars for originality, good story and characters, good moral, and great as far as visual quality.If nothing else, give this movie a rent.

1255521,A4GB8I8ACS4PM,B00288KNJU,"Kevin Pepper ""JedeyeNite""","[6, 9]","I teach 5th grade, and one of the treats I have given my class over the years was to read a chapter from Coraline by Neil Gaiman.  My students will beg me to please read from Coraline, as I do the voices while I read the story.  This comes in handy when you want them to do their work, but you need a little motivation.  When I heard that it was to be made into a stop motion movie, I was ecstatic.  It was even more exciting to find that the people behind the classic Nightmare Before Christmas would be in charge of bringing this quirky little story to life.  The one apprehension I had was that I create my own voices for characters when I read aloud to my class, and after reading this book aloud for a few years, I had developed my own interpretations of how each character sounded. This is a great story to tell aloud, and it creates a lot of tension which leaves them hanging on begging for more.So how does the movie compare to the book????  From the very beginning, a reader of the book will notice that there are some differences.  The movie is set in America, while the book is in England.  There is also a new character created for the movie.  You will not find Wybie anywhere in the book.  After watching the whole movie, I can understand why Wybie was placed in the movie.  Without him, Coraline spends a lot of time talking to herself.  While that may work fine in a book, it doesn't really translate well on film.  Therefore, I think that the inclusion of Wybie helps to carry the narrative along and it also provides a companion for Coraline.  The one thing that annoys me is the fact that the character of the Other Mother is nothing like I portrayed her when reading the story to my class.  This is not really a criticism, it's just that I had created my own version of her in my head, and it didn't correlate with the version in the film.  I'm not complaining about this, it was just a little bit of a distraction for me having read the book many times.  The rest of the characters and the story follow very closely to the book.  Of course the filmmakers had to add some scenes in order to flesh out the story so it could fill the time requirement as a feature film.  I don't think that any of the added material detracts from the story as a whole.  I have never seen a film adaptation of a book that was EXACTLY like the book.  Afterall, they are two different mediums, and each has its own requirements in what will work to tell the story.  This is a great adaptation, and I know that any fan of the book will not be dissatisfied by this movie.Here are my thoughts on the 3-D version:First of all, I would suggest that you read the notice about what settings on your TV will provide the best conditions for a good 3-D viewing experience.  It also works better to view this in a darkened room.  Since this has become a new trend in recent films, I have had the opportunity to see 3-D films both in the theater and at home.  Of course, current home theater technology does not lend itself to the pristine digital 3-D process by which this film was shown in theaters.  However, I will have to say that it is the best 3-D effects I have seen in a home setting.  Needless to say that the 3-D glasses do wash out a lot of the vibrant colors that are present in the 2-D version, but enough of the color is left to enjoy the beautiful artistry that went into the making of this film.  I would suggest that the viewer watch all of the credits, as there are several characters flying around in the background. If you watch all the way to the end of the credits there is a nice little 3-D effect at the very end.Bottom Line:This is a great interpretation of a wonderful book, and I would heartily recommend this to any viewer.",5,"This is The Other Coraline, NOT Coraline the Book.",1248480000,"07 25, 2009",2009,3737,"['teach', '5th', 'grade', 'one', 'treats', 'have', 'given', 'class', 'years', 'was', 'read', 'chapter', 'Coraline', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'students', 'will', 'beg', 'please', 'read', 'Coraline', 'do', 'voices', 'read', 'story', 'handy', 'when', 'want', 'do', 'work', 'need', 'little', 'motivation', 'When', 'heard', 'was', 'be', 'made', 'stop', 'motion', 'movie', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'exciting', 'find', 'people', 'classic', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'would', 'be', 'charge', 'bringing', 'quirky', 'little', 'story', 'life', 'one', 'apprehension', 'had', 'was', 'create', 'own', 'voices', 'characters', 'when', 'read', 'aloud', 'class', 'reading', 'book', 'aloud', 'few', 'years', 'had', 'developed', 'own', 'interpretations', 'how', 'character', 'sounded', 'great', 'story', 'tell', 'aloud', 'lot', 'tension', 'hanging', 'begging', 'more.So', 'how', 'movie', 'compare', 'book', 'very', 'beginning', 'reader', 'book', 'will', 'notice', 'are', 'differences', 'movie', 'set', 'America', 'book', 'England', 'also', 'new', 'character', 'created', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'Wybie', 'anywhere', 'book', 'watching', 'whole', 'movie', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'Wybie', 'was', 'placed', 'movie', 'Coraline', 'lot', 'time', 'talking', 'herself', 'may', 'work', 'fine', 'book', ""n't"", 'really', 'translate', 'well', 'film', 'Therefore', 'think', 'inclusion', 'Wybie', 'carry', 'narrative', 'along', 'also', 'companion', 'Coraline', 'one', 'thing', 'fact', 'character', 'Other', 'Mother', 'nothing', 'portrayed', 'when', 'reading', 'story', 'class', 'not', 'really', 'criticism', 'just', 'had', 'created', 'own', 'version', 'head', 'did', ""n't"", 'correlate', 'version', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'was', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'distraction', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'many', 'times', 'rest', 'characters', 'story', 'follow', 'very', 'closely', 'book', 'course', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'add', 'scenes', 'order', 'flesh', 'out', 'story', 'could', 'fill', 'time', 'requirement', 'feature', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'added', 'material', 'detracts', 'story', 'whole', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'adaptation', 'book', 'was', 'EXACTLY', 'book', 'Afterall', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'mediums', 'own', 'requirements', 'what', 'will', 'work', 'tell', 'story', 'great', 'adaptation', 'know', 'fan', 'book', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'dissatisfied', 'are', 'thoughts', '3-D', 'version', 'First', 'would', 'suggest', 'read', 'notice', 'what', 'settings', 'TV', 'will', 'provide', 'best', 'conditions', 'good', '3-D', 'viewing', 'experience', 'also', 'better', 'view', 'darkened', 'room', 'become', 'new', 'trend', 'recent', 'films', 'have', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', '3-D', 'films', 'theater', 'home', 'course', 'current', 'home', 'theater', 'technology', 'not', 'lend', 'pristine', 'digital', '3-D', 'process', 'film', 'was', 'shown', 'theaters', 'However', 'will', 'have', 'say', 'best', '3-D', 'effects', 'have', 'seen', 'home', 'setting', 'Needless', 'say', '3-D', 'glasses', 'do', 'wash', 'out', 'lot', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'are', 'present', '2-D', 'version', 'enough', 'color', 'left', 'enjoy', 'beautiful', 'artistry', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'would', 'suggest', 'viewer', 'watch', 'credits', 'are', 'several', 'characters', 'flying', 'around', 'background', 'watch', 'way', 'end', 'credits', 'nice', 'little', '3-D', 'effect', 'very', 'end.Bottom', 'Line', 'great', 'interpretation', 'wonderful', 'book', 'would', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'viewer']",N/A

But as it stands right now, that was 100 minutes I'd like back and a thousand unpleasant images I'd like to return.Breathtaking? Brilliant? I'm sure the stop-motion was a tremendous amount of creative work. So if it was, why would they go to all that trouble to make everything so damn ugly?  I'm all for macabre and dark, but most of the imagery in this movie was harsh, grating, uncomfortable and creepy - not in a good way.  There were only a few scenes that made me go, ""Oooo, wow"", and the rest was just ICK.  And what was the overall moral of the story?

I'm 37 and felt like I needed adult accompaniment to watch this, lol.  A friend of mine has a young daughter who read the book, and after she did was so freaked out by it she said she never, never, never wanted to see the movie.

'hmm this doesn't sound too bad, maybe my little one could have watched it with us'.  I am so glad I didn't let that happen!  This was a horribly scary movie.  To not rate it PG-13 implies that it would be fine to watch with the whole family with children less than 13 and, because it is animated, possibly even include children as young as four or five.  But please do not be mislead into thinking that!  The subject matter and content of this movie should not be viewed by children younger than 13!The main character Coraline, is understandably mad and depressed because her parents have no time for her and pay no attention to her, but she takes it out on every one around her, especially ""Wybie"".  Wybie is a little boy who lives near the house Coraline just moved into.  Wybie is short for Wyborne, which when Coraline yells at him to go home, changes his name to ""Why Were You Born!""  Children hear that so often from the bullies at school, they don't need to hear it validated, condoned and encouraged on the big screen!This movie is very similar to Alice in Wonderland in weirdness.  The cat talks.  Flowers come alive attacking and grabbing at you.  Bugs are oversized, becoming chairs and wardrobes.  Coraline has to open a small door and travel through a tunnel to get through to the other side.  Other characters are far out, speak in riddle or rhyme, disappear and pop up out of nowhere.  Cute mice turn in to nasty rats.  A circus performer dances around strangely and is obsessed with eating beets.There are so many oddities included in the movie, in addition to the ones I listed above, that I just plain don't understand.  In a theater, to watch a performance, the entire audience is Scottish terriers sitting on plush theater seats.  Two women live together and at one moment you wonder if they are a couple.  One women is old and uses a walker.  The other has super skinny legs but HUGE breasts.  Which at one time they show her completely nude wearing only a thong and pasties doing a dance on stage!The movie deals with witch craft, ghosts and voodo-like dolls.  The two women believe in reading tea leaves.  Coraline is presented with a doll that resembles her which we find out later is how the ""other mother"" spies on Coraline.  While Coraline is in the other world she gets thrown into a mirror by her ""other Mother"" which puts her in a room without an exit.  There she meets the ghosts of three children who had lived and died in this other world.  The ""other mother"" turns from a very nice woman to a very angry spider like, skeleton like, robot like, thing.This movie is full of adult content.  There are a lot of scary, really freaky images.  Lots of anger.I believe this is just one writers warped idea of a story.  The writer must have been on drugs or was in an altered state of mind.  I don't know how the movie ever became reality or how the book was ever published.  But this is not a movie I would recommend at all.

I was pretty impressed with the film, and it was quite pleasing to watch and experience.The movie is about a young girl, Coraline, who moves into a new apartment-house. Her parents are both very busy working on their gardening catalog, which they hope to sell and make lots of money, so Coraline is left seeking parental love. She's also bored in her new place, surrounded by strange and quirky neighbors. A neighborhood kid gives her a doll that happens to look a lot like her, though it has buttons for eyes.Things start getting strange for Coraline, and the line between reality and fantasy is blurred masterfully. The way the movie is filmed is aesthetically beautiful, yet slightly strange and twisted, reminiscent of Nightmare Before Christmas or Corpse Bride.All in all, I liked the movie. The visual effects were amazing, the accompanying music fitting, and the story intriguing. It seems like a great movie for a child, as I imagine their eyes would be wide with wonder at what they are seeing. The movie is available in 3-d, if you happen to have glasses or something to watch it in, which could make it even more enjoyable.

When we saw it in cinema, my then 9 years old daughter liked it a lot too, even if she found it a little bit creepy and scary - but I will definitely wait until my younger daughter is at least 9 before watching it with her, because this film is TOO creepy and scary for little kids.11 years old Coraline Jones moves with her parents to the Pink Palace, a dilapidated mansion renovated into an apartment building somewhere in the middle of nowhere in Oregon. Occupants of two other apartments are two old ladies, who are more than a little bit odd and an archi-eccentric Russian acrobat, Mr. Bobinsky. As if those three strange characters were not enough Coraline meets Wyborn (God, what a name to give to your kid!), the grandson of the landlady, a boy roughly her age - who is every inch as odd as other people around and whom she dislikes instantly. With her parents working all time and no company Coraline is very unhappy and bored and tries to kill some time by exploring - it is then that she discovers a small door sealed off by a brick wall... And then the film really begins.The quality of the scenario, dialogs and images in this film is simply stellar! I was really taken by the story and impressed by the visual aspect of the movie. I must however once again stress the point, that this is a CREEPY thing, more in the line of classical (fairly brutal and cruel) fairytales of Brothers Grimm, than of Disney films. There are some genuinely scary moments which made my 9 years old daughter uncomfortable - and I am certain that any 5 years old kid will freak out during those scenes and then make nightmares about them...With just that little parental warning included, I must say that ""Coraline"" is amongst the most impressive films I ever saw. This is indeed - and I measure my words here - a MASTERPIECE of cinema. To buy, watch and keep.

My 11 and 15 year olds loved it, though I would say it might be a bit 'too' scary for children younger than that (it's quite sinister in parts - this is not saccharine Disney, but Tim Burton territory - and he rarely panders nor holds back).Four flimsy card glasses are provided for the 3D version (you choose either 2D or 3D from the main menu), but as you watch it, they irritate and you're far too aware of them. Pixar's ""Up"" had proper 3D glasses when we went to see it at the cinema and they made a huge difference to both the quality of the 3D effect and the comfort (too busy enjoying the film to notice).The 2D version couldn't be more different. The BLU RAY image is awesome - really bringing out the workmanship that went into each shot. The richness of the animation and the hugely imaginative way all the characters look in every single scene - it's all an absolute blast. The vocal work is typically ace too (Dakota Fanning shines) and the story of parents and their children straying apart is like a dark Brothers Grimm tale that will unfortunately ring too true for many. The extras are superb too. Shame the whole thing is let down by the 3D side of things.To sum up - and despite some niggles - the gobsmacking beauty of the print, the great voice talent and the dead clever grown-up story make it all worthwhile.This is one you'll watch again and again - and your kids will impress their friends with it.Recommended.",4,"""...No Coraline!"" said the Evil Spider.

The voiceovers are perfect and the animation is flawless; the story is quite captivating, too. I was fascinated by the plot and it never bored me. The musical score enhances the film, too.When the film starts, we meet young Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) and her parents who are so busy writing for a gardening catalog that they have no time for Coraline. Coraline's angst is even stronger because they just moved away from their old neighborhood into a dilapidated old building called the ""Pink Palace Apartments;"" Coraline has no friends here. She does meet Wybie Lovat (Robert Bailey, Jr.), a quirky young boy, although they don't hit it off too well at the very start. There are the downstairs neighbors Miss April Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Miss Miriam Forcible (Dawn French), two eccentrics who provide light comic relief from the scarier parts of the plot; and there's Mr. Sergei Alexander Bobinsky (Ian McShane), the upstairs neighbor who worked as a circus performer in his younger days. There's also the neighborhood cat who sometimes tags along after Wybie.Even with these new neighbors, things are pretty dull for Coraline; but things change when one day she discovers a door behind an armoire. Coraline begs her mother to open the door but they discover nothing but a wall of bricks! Coraline's mother brushes it off; but Coraline remains curious. She eventually discovers that the bricks hide a tunnel to another world just like hers--only much better. Her ""other parents"" are very affectionate and they anticipate Coraline's every whim; they spend time with her and she has lots of fun--there's even a circus act with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible that lets Coraline get in on the act! She's having a ball and she simply returns automatically to her real home after she goes to sleep in her ""other"" home.But the third time Coraline goes to her ""other"" parents and her ""other"" home, things start to get creepy real fast. Coraline's ""other"" mother and father want to sew buttons into her eyes and keep her there for good! Coraline also discovers the souls of three children whose lives have been eaten up and destroyed by the ""other"" mother; now Coraline finally realizes what her ""other"" parents want from her. Coraline's ""other"" parents undergo just a slight change of appearance, too.The plot can go anywhere from here. Coraline eventually gets back to her real home, but I won't tell you much about that so as not to ruin it for you. But what does Coraline do when she discovers that her ""other"" mother has taken and trapped her real parents? Can Coraline get her real parents back from this incredibly wicked ""other"" mother? Will the talking cat from the ""other"" world help Coraline or hinder her? Will Wybie help Coraline--and, if so, how? No spoilers here--watch and find out!The DVD has an optional running commentary with director Henry Selick and composer Bruno Coulais. In addition, one side of the DVD has a 3-D version of this film.Coraline impresses me as a very good thriller that has outstanding stop-motion animation. People who enjoy thrillers, animated films, and pictures that use science fiction and fantasy to further the plot would do well to add this DVD to their collections.",5,a scary animated thriller--and I admit I had to watch it with the lights on !!!,1251072000,"08 24, 2009",2009,3359,"['Coraline', 'fine', 'example', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'finest', 'one', 'side', 'DVD', 'even', 'feature', 'length', 'film', '3-D', 'voiceovers', 'are', 'perfect', 'animation', 'flawless', 'story', 'quite', 'captivating', 'too', 'was', 'fascinated', 'plot', 'never', 'bored', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'too.When', 'film', 'meet', 'young', 'Coraline', 'Jones', 'voiced', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'busy', 'writing', 'gardening', 'catalog', 'have', 'time', 'Coraline', 'Coraline', 'angst', 'even', 'stronger', 'just', 'moved', 'away', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'dilapidated', 'old', 'building', 'called', 'Pink', 'Palace', 'Apartments', 'Coraline', 'friends', 'here', 'meet', 'Wybie', 'Lovat', 'Robert', 'Bailey', 'Jr.', 'quirky', 'young', 'boy', 'do', ""n't"", 'hit', 'off', 'too', 'well', 'very', 'start', 'are', 'downstairs', 'neighbors', 'Miss', 'April', 'Spink', 'Jennifer', 'Saunders', 'Miss', 'Miriam', 'Forcible', 'Dawn', 'French', 'two', 'eccentrics', 'who', 'provide', 'light', 'comic', 'relief', 'scarier', 'parts', 'plot', 'Mr.', 'Sergei', 'Alexander', 'Bobinsky', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'upstairs', 'neighbor', 'who', 'worked', 'circus', 'performer', 'younger', 'days', 'also', 'neighborhood', 'cat', 'who', 'tags', 'Wybie.Even', 'new', 'neighbors', 'things', 'are', 'pretty', 'dull', 'Coraline', 'things', 'change', 'when', 'one', 'day', 'door', 'armoire', 'Coraline', 'mother', 'open', 'door', 'discover', 'nothing', 'wall', 'bricks', 'Coraline', 'mother', 'brushes', 'off', 'Coraline', 'curious', 'eventually', 'bricks', 'hide', 'tunnel', 'world', 'just', 'hers', 'only', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'parents', 'are', 'very', 'affectionate', 'anticipate', 'Coraline', 'whim', 'spend', 'time', 'lots', 'fun', 'even', 'circus', 'act', 'Miss', 'Spink', 'Miss', 'Forcible', 'Coraline', 'get', 'act', 'having', 'ball', 'simply', 'automatically', 'real', 'home', 'sleep', 'other', 'third', 'time', 'Coraline', 'other', 'parents', 'other', 'home', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'creepy', 'real', 'fast', 'Coraline', 'other', 'mother', 'father', 'want', 'sew', 'buttons', 'eyes', 'keep', 'good', 'Coraline', 'also', 'souls', 'three', 'children', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'eaten', 'up', 'destroyed', 'other', 'mother', 'now', 'Coraline', 'finally', 'what', 'other', 'parents', 'want', 'Coraline', 'other', 'parents', 'undergo', 'just', 'slight', 'change', 'appearance', 'too.The', 'plot', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'here', 'Coraline', 'eventually', 'back', 'real', 'home', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'so', 'not', 'ruin', 'what', 'Coraline', 'do', 'when', 'other', 'mother', 'taken', 'trapped', 'real', 'parents', 'Can', 'Coraline', 'get', 'real', 'parents', 'back', 'incredibly', 'wicked', 'other', 'mother', 'Will', 'talking', 'cat', 'other', 'world', 'help', 'Coraline', 'hinder', 'Will', 'Wybie', 'help', 'Coraline', 'so', 'how', 'spoilers', 'here', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'optional', 'running', 'commentary', 'director', 'Henry', 'Selick', 'composer', 'Bruno', 'Coulais', 'addition', 'one', 'side', 'DVD', '3-D', 'version', 'film.Coraline', 'very', 'good', 'thriller', 'outstanding', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'People', 'who', 'enjoy', 'thrillers', 'animated', 'films', 'pictures', 'use', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'further', 'plot', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'add', 'DVD', 'collections']",N/A

Though bored out of her mind, she's also adventurous and self-reliant, and it's not long before she discovers the secret door hidden behind the wallpaper in the parlor that gives her access to an alternative world with apparently wonderful alternative parents. Of course (as a story like this requires), not all is as it seems in that distorted world. The other tenants include the retired circus man, Mr. Bobinsky, and the elderly Misses Spink and Forcible (and their wall full of stuffed deceased terriers), and a feral cat with very fixed opinions when it comes to rats, and who attempts to give Coraline good advice which she waits almost too long to listen to.

Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is an 11-year-old girl whose family has just moved into an apartment in a slightly dilapidated Victorian house. While her parents are busy finishing up work on a deadline, and it pours rain outside, Coraline is bored. Then she discovers a small door in the living room that has been papered over. At night the door leads to another house like hers, only better, with more attentive versions of her parents and perfected versions of her eccentric neighbors. Her Other Mother (Terry Hatcher) invites Coraline to stay in the other world, but there is high price to pay, and Coraline begins to suspect something sinister.Stop-motion animation was the choice for this film because it ages well. I couldn't agree more. ""Coraline"" looks fantastic and distinctive. It leaves a strong visual impression. I was reminded of ""The Mascot"" (1934), an early example of stop-motion that is as strong today as it was 75 years ago. I have not read the novel ""Coraline"", but I understand that the film has made significant changes, including that addition of a prologue in which we see mechanical hands creating a doll of Coraline. I'm grateful for that sequence, as it contains some of the film's most memorable animation. Like so many children's stories, there is a lesson imbedded in the tale. The film's tagline is ""Be careful what you wish for"". In the Other World, everything is exactly how Coraline would like it, for herself and for others. But it makes her value her real family all the more.There has been a lot of discussion about whether ""Coraline"" is actually a children's film. It is not graphic; there is no blood or guts. There are disturbing ideas which are enhanced by creepy imagery. I would caution that it is probably too scary for children under six. For 6-10-year-olds, it is an entirely individual matter. The book on which it is based is fantasy/horror intended for 9-12-year-olds. Some children like to be scared, and if your 8-year-old is one of those kids, ""Coraline"" might be just the thing. If your child is sensitive, you may not want to cope with the nightmares. It's a nice film for older children, because it encourages children to be bright and independent and never condescends to them. It doesn't have the thematic sophistication that makes many Pixar films equally suitable for adults. But ""Coraline"" is visually interesting enough that it won't bore adults either.The DVD (Universal 2009 single disc edition): The single disc edition has the 2-D film on one side of the disc and a 3-D version on the other. It comes with 4 pairs of glasses for viewing the 3-D. This isn't the same 3-D as was in movie theaters. That technology is not available for home viewing, so this version is the old blue-red 3-D. There is an audio commentary by director Henry Selick and composer Bruno Coulais on the 2-D side of the disc. This is a constant, information-packed commentary. Selick talks about the changes he made to the book, the look of the real world versus the other world, and a lot of technical information about filming and working with the puppets. Coulais joins the commentary near the end. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH, Spanish, French. Dubbing available in Spanish, French.",4,Striking Stop-Motion Animates a Creepy Children's Morality Tale.,1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,3459,"['Henry', 'Selick', 'best', 'known', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', '1993', 'James', 'Giant', 'Peach', '1996', 'talent', 'stop-motion', 'animation', 'adaptation', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'children', 'novel', 'Coraline', 'Coraline', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', '11-year-old', 'girl', 'family', 'just', 'moved', 'apartment', 'slightly', 'dilapidated', 'Victorian', 'house', 'parents', 'are', 'busy', 'finishing', 'up', 'work', 'deadline', 'rain', 'Coraline', 'bored', 'Then', 'small', 'door', 'living', 'room', 'been', 'papered', 'night', 'door', 'house', 'hers', 'only', 'better', 'more', 'attentive', 'versions', 'parents', 'perfected', 'versions', 'eccentric', 'neighbors', 'Other', 'Mother', 'Terry', 'Hatcher', 'Coraline', 'stay', 'other', 'world', 'high', 'price', 'pay', 'Coraline', 'suspect', 'something', 'sinister.Stop-motion', 'animation', 'was', 'choice', 'film', 'well', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'more', 'Coraline', 'fantastic', 'distinctive', 'strong', 'visual', 'impression', 'was', 'reminded', 'Mascot', '1934', 'early', 'example', 'stop-motion', 'strong', 'today', 'was', '75', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'Coraline', 'understand', 'film', 'made', 'significant', 'changes', 'including', 'addition', 'prologue', 'see', 'mechanical', 'hands', 'creating', 'doll', 'Coraline', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'sequence', 'film', 'most', 'memorable', 'animation', 'so', 'many', 'children', 'stories', 'lesson', 'imbedded', 'tale', 'film', 'tagline', 'Be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'Other', 'World', 'everything', 'exactly', 'how', 'Coraline', 'would', 'like', 'herself', 'others', 'value', 'real', 'family', 'more.There', 'been', 'lot', 'discussion', 'Coraline', 'actually', 'children', 'film', 'not', 'graphic', 'blood', 'guts', 'are', 'disturbing', 'ideas', 'are', 'enhanced', 'creepy', 'imagery', 'would', 'caution', 'probably', 'too', 'scary', 'children', 'six', '6-10-year-olds', 'entirely', 'individual', 'matter', 'book', 'based', 'fantasy/horror', 'intended', '9-12-year-olds', 'children', 'be', 'scared', '8-year-old', 'one', 'kids', 'Coraline', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'thing', 'child', 'sensitive', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'cope', 'nightmares', 'nice', 'film', 'older', 'children', 'children', 'be', 'bright', 'independent', 'never', 'condescends', ""n't"", 'have', 'thematic', 'sophistication', 'many', 'Pixar', 'films', 'equally', 'suitable', 'adults', 'Coraline', 'visually', 'interesting', 'enough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'adults', 'either.The', 'DVD', 'Universal', '2009', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', '2-D', 'film', 'one', 'side', 'disc', '3-D', 'version', 'other', '4', 'pairs', 'glasses', 'viewing', '3-D', ""n't"", 'same', '3-D', 'was', 'movie', 'theaters', 'technology', 'not', 'available', 'home', 'viewing', 'version', 'old', 'blue-red', '3-D', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Henry', 'Selick', 'composer', 'Bruno', 'Coulais', '2-D', 'side', 'disc', 'constant', 'information-packed', 'commentary', 'Selick', 'talks', 'changes', 'made', 'book', 'look', 'real', 'world', 'other', 'world', 'lot', 'technical', 'information', 'filming', 'working', 'puppets', 'Coulais', 'commentary', 'end', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'film', 'English', 'SDH', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Dubbing', 'available', 'Spanish', 'French']",N/A

My wife, my nearly-8-year-old son and I curled up with some popcorn after dinner, and sat back to see what this was all about.From the first eerie, muted scenes, and off-kilter score, you realize you're about to take a trip to somewhere you haven't been before, and it might not be 100% pleasant.I must say my son was hypnotized from the first scene. He even put down his Nintendo DS. I don't think he blinked more than twice during the whole running time.The tale, about Coraline, her odd family and MORE odd ""other"" family, is a fractured fairy tale to be sure. There's a classicism to the story...it has a little Hansel and Gretel to it...but it's also defiantly modern in the heroine's sensibilities.The plot has been outlined to death by other reviewers.While the movie unspooled, my wife kept looking over to me, the look on her face of ""this is kinda creepy"" was unmistakable.I asked my son a few times, ""Are you OK? Are you scared?"", and each time he replied ""Yes"" with a smile.The animation is living, breathing,  moving art. Dear God you could stare into that (2D for me) picture and find infinite, amazing details within each room, each exterior...the garden...there's one shot that will literally take your breath away. You will actually pause your respiratory effort, so that you can absorb that gorgeous overhead shot of the garden. If you've seen the movie, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. If you haven't, well, if you remember anything about this review, you'll remember THIS when you see that shot.The voice acting is superb. The expressive puppetry is nothing short of miraculous. The music is intertwined with the images brilliantly.I enjoyed this about as much as my son, and more than my wife, who was still pretty creeped out at the end.The making-of stuff is thorough, but not overwhelming.At less than sixteen bucks, this disc is a bargain and a half.",4,Wickedly hypnotic.,1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,1975,"['had', 'earthly', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'when', 'popped', 'Coraline', 'Blu-Ray', 'player', 'My', 'wife', 'nearly-8-year-old', 'son', 'curled', 'up', 'popcorn', 'dinner', 'sat', 'back', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'first', 'eerie', 'muted', 'scenes', 'off-kilter', 'score', 'realize', ""'re"", 'take', 'trip', 'somewhere', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'before', 'might', 'not', 'be', '100', '%', 'pleasant.I', 'must', 'say', 'son', 'was', 'hypnotized', 'first', 'scene', 'even', 'put', 'down', 'Nintendo', 'DS', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'blinked', 'more', 'twice', 'whole', 'running', 'time.The', 'tale', 'about', 'Coraline', 'odd', 'family', 'MORE', 'odd', 'other', 'family', 'fractured', 'fairy', 'tale', 'be', 'sure', 'classicism', 'story', 'little', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'also', 'defiantly', 'modern', 'heroine', 'sensibilities.The', 'plot', 'been', 'outlined', 'death', 'other', 'reviewers.While', 'movie', 'unspooled', 'wife', 'kept', 'looking', 'look', 'face', 'kinda', 'creepy', 'was', 'unmistakable.I', 'asked', 'son', 'few', 'times', 'Are', 'Are', 'scared', 'time', 'replied', 'Yes', 'smile.The', 'animation', 'living', 'breathing', 'moving', 'art', 'Dear', 'God', 'could', 'stare', '2D', 'picture', 'find', 'infinite', 'amazing', 'details', 'room', 'exterior', 'garden', 'one', 'shot', 'will', 'literally', 'take', 'breath', 'away', 'will', 'actually', 'pause', 'respiratory', 'effort', 'can', 'absorb', 'gorgeous', 'overhead', 'shot', 'garden', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'have', ""n't"", 'well', 'remember', 'anything', 'review', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'THIS', 'when', 'see', 'shot.The', 'voice', 'acting', 'superb', 'expressive', 'puppetry', 'nothing', 'short', 'miraculous', 'music', 'intertwined', 'images', 'brilliantly.I', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'son', 'more', 'wife', 'who', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'creeped', 'out', 'end.The', 'making-of', 'stuff', 'thorough', 'not', 'overwhelming.At', 'less', 'sixteen', 'bucks', 'disc', 'bargain', 'half']",N/A

She discovers a portal into elsewhere, with an other mother who is all too eager to please.  If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  Luckily, Coraline's got the courage and pluck to face up to the absurdity and horror she faces on the other side.  Based on Neil Gaiman's inventive modern children's classic, it's a brilliant stop-motion adaptation, comparable in depth and theme and mystery to Lewis Carroll'sAlice In Wonderlandand Hayao Miyazaki'sSpirited Away.I saw this in 3-D in theaters, and just finished watching the 3-D version of the DVD on TV - on a 42"" LCD flat screen, which may account for part of why it looked so good.  I was very impressed by the 3-D look - this is the first time I've seen a home version 3-D that really worked.  Of course the theatrical 3-D version was the first one I'd seen that didn't feel like a gimmick.  There are moments of ""in your face"" shock designed to surprise and impress - but what's really impressive is  the immersive character of the world.  It feels like a lived-in fantastic world with depth and texture - quite exciting.  The music sets just the right mood.  The voices are perfectly meshed with the characters - and unlike many contemporary animated films don't call attention to themselves.  I never once thought ""that's Dakota Fanning"" or ""Terri Hatcher.""While the colors seem slightly muted in the DVD's 3-D version, the depth is definitely there, and it looks nearly perfect if you watch it in the dark, as recommended.

While the look ofThe Nightmare Before Christmaswears with time, this is just perfectly smooth.  The colors are beautiful and the movement is gracious.  The film itself is disturbing in all the good ways, and the story is surprisingly dark and creepy considering it's essentially a children's movie.  The best way I can describe the feel of CORALINE is this.  Imagine if a creepier version of Pixar, known for making intelligent movies with strong themes that are thought-provoking for adults but still accessible for children, made a stop-motion flick.A lot of fans, ignorant to the fact that Tim Burton PRODUCEDThe Nightmare Before Christmas, not directed it, will be fooled by the ""from the director ofThe Nightmare Before Christmas"" label on this film.  So it will definitely get the Burton crowd.  But, by and large, the story and visuals are superior to Burton's work.  Since it's adapted from Neil Gaiman's popular book, which I unfortunately didn't get a chance to read before I saw the film, you know you can trust to be told a delightfully creepy tale.  The movie does find a nice balance between keeping the visuals stunning and maintaining the integrity of Gaiman's story.So far, this seems like a glowing review.  It's coming out that way because the film definitely has a lot going for it.  The animation deserves praise, the script is good, and the voice acting (which I haven't mentioned) is also great.  But, even at one-hundred minutes, this film feels way too long.  I was bored in parts, and felt that the movie could have lost fifteen minutes without losing a shred of its complexity.  I still enjoyed it, and wouldn't mind seeing it again.  Not sure if it's worth owning on DVD unless you're a huge animation fan or really dig Gaiman's work, but it's at least worth a rent!7/10",4,Best Looking Stop-Motion Flick So Far,1250640000,"08 19, 2009",2009,1866,"['CORALINE', 'far', 'best', 'example', 'stop', 'motion', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'look', 'ofThe', 'Nightmare', 'Christmaswears', 'time', 'just', 'perfectly', 'smooth', 'colors', 'are', 'beautiful', 'movement', 'gracious', 'film', 'disturbing', 'good', 'ways', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'dark', 'creepy', 'considering', 'essentially', 'children', 'movie', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'describe', 'feel', 'CORALINE', 'Imagine', 'creepier', 'version', 'Pixar', 'known', 'making', 'intelligent', 'movies', 'strong', 'themes', 'are', 'thought-provoking', 'adults', 'still', 'accessible', 'children', 'made', 'stop-motion', 'flick.A', 'lot', 'fans', 'ignorant', 'fact', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'PRODUCEDThe', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'not', 'directed', 'will', 'be', 'fooled', 'director', 'ofThe', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'label', 'film', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'Burton', 'crowd', 'large', 'story', 'visuals', 'are', 'superior', 'Burton', 'work', 'adapted', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'popular', 'book', 'unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'read', 'saw', 'film', 'know', 'can', 'trust', 'be', 'told', 'delightfully', 'creepy', 'tale', 'movie', 'find', 'nice', 'balance', 'keeping', 'visuals', 'stunning', 'maintaining', 'integrity', 'Gaiman', 'story.So', 'far', 'glowing', 'review', 'coming', 'out', 'way', 'film', 'definitely', 'lot', 'going', 'animation', 'praise', 'script', 'good', 'voice', 'acting', 'have', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'also', 'great', 'even', 'one-hundred', 'minutes', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'was', 'bored', 'parts', 'felt', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'lost', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'losing', 'shred', 'complexity', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'again', 'Not', 'sure', 'worth', 'owning', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'huge', 'animation', 'fan', 'really', 'dig', 'Gaiman', 'work', 'least', 'rent', '7/10']",N/A

There's even a catchy and clever song by ""They Might Be Giants"" complete with double entendre ""She's a peach, she's a doll, she's a pal of mine/She's As Cute As a Button In the Eyes Of/Everyone Who Ever Laid Their Eyes on/Coraline"" (""buttons"" for the eyes of ""dolls"" being a characteristic of the belle dame's fantasy world).The story of Coraline feeling neglected by her parents and enticed by an alternate world where everything seems better (emphasis on the word ""seems"") is great, but it may be a little scary for some kids (think ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" meets ""Alice in Wonderland""). There's also a hilarious but revealing costume of a bosomy downstairs neighbor during a theater scene in the belle dame's world, which may shock some parents, but I don't think anything else is too objectionable.Beyond that, I should mention that this Blu-ray has THE best quality picture I've ever seen on the format!

I just saw this movie today at the theater, and I must say it is one of the most visually captivating and surreal experiences I've seen on the big screen. But in a good way! And not to mention I saw this in Digital 3D, and that made it even better! This was the best 3D movie I've ever seen!This is also the first Stop Motion movie to be filmed in 3D, and I sure hope they make more of them. The 3D wasn't gimmicky with things flying out at you, the 3D adds tone and depth to the movie. Like the scenes in the tunnel- you really feel as if you're in there! and the glasses are great too- they aren't the crappy Red and Blue glasses which hurt your eyes. They're polarized 3D glasses, meaning slightly tinted, like sunglasses. This said, it's crystal clear, and your eyes actually feel good while watching this.In Coraline, Coraline Jones and her workaholic parents move to an old apartment close to the woods. The place needs a lot of enhancing, and where she lives are two ladies on the lower level and the a crazy but loveable man named Mr. Bobinski on the higher level. She is also being annoyed by Wyborn, a nerd who lives with his grandma. However, in the house, there is a secret doorway which in the day, is justst bricks, but in the evening is a portal to another world. She goes to this other world and finds that her ""Other family"" lives there, and they have buttons for eyes. They also have the ""other"" Wyborn, and so on. This is a great place to be and offers happiness until Coraline realizes she must make a sacrifice she'd never make. And because of this, things start getting pretty scary!!!This is a beautiful and amazing movie. I don't think I've ever seen something so captivating visually and story-wise, and this movie has some beautiful and sometimes disturbing imagery. It really is Dali-ish at times and is pretty stunning to look at. And as I mentioned before, the 3D is spectacular. There is nothing like it. Like I said, it's not gimmicky, it makes the movie more dramatic. It brings the movie to life, and puts you in it. I must warn you this is NOT for kids- it's VERY creepy and for the most part, will frighten the young ones.So in short, do not miss this movie while it's in theatres, You won't regret it, and if you can see it in 3D, be sure to do it.

1255576,A4FX5YCJA630V,B00288KNJU,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 1]","Every now and then a film adaptation of a beloved book comes along that not only supplements the original material, but in many ways improves upon it.Coralinebegan as a novella by Neil Gaiman, a creepy and twisted fairy tale that told of a young girl who discovers a little door in her new house, one that leads to a beautiful and wondrous world ruled over by her Other Mother, a woman who in all ways resembles her real mother save for the fact that she has buttons for eyes. Attentive and loving, Coraline's Other Mother urges her to stay in the fantasy world that she's built for her, filled with dancing mice and delicious food and magical toys.Naturally, Coraline learns the hard way that you should be careful what you wish for. It's a relatively short but potent story, drawing upon ancient folklore in order to shape several facets of the plot, and which excels in seeing the world through the eyes of a child. Tapping into our most primal fears of darkness, isolation, abandonment and wicked parents, the story was ripe for adaptation, particularly through the medium of stop-motion animation.Director Henry Selick (who also directedThe Nightmare Before Christmas) melds Gaiman's characters and plot with his own visual brilliance, making ""Coraline"" an exceptional work of art as well as an engrossing story, and it's fascinating to see the ways in which he expands and explores Gaiman's original plot. Coraline is a little older in the film than in the book, and the entire story is transported from England to America, but the film puts a greater emphasis on her relationship with her parents, her belligerent attitude in moving house, and on the Other Mother's attempts to ""bait the trap"" before trying to convince Coraline to stay.Perhaps the most interesting difference is the inclusion of Wybie, the grandson of the owner of the house where Coraline and her parents stay. Because much of the book is conveyed through Coraline's internal dialogue, Wybie was invented for the film in order to gave her someone to share exposition with. Somewhat controversially, his presence also puts a new spin on the final confrontation between Coraline and the Other Mother's disembodied hand, one that I can't help but feel played out better in the book.But both versions of the story complement each other wonderfully, something that only a handful of book-to-film adaptations manage to achieve (The Princess Brideis another that comes to mind). The pain-staking process of stop-motion animation means that every minute of screen-time was months in the making, resulting in a truly astounding visual experience. The technical skill that goes into creating Coraline and the world she lives in is nothing short of incredible, with a level of complexity in movement and expression that is seldom seen in this medium.The film also adds plenty of its own little touches. The Other Mother noticeably never eats any of the food that she lays before Coraline. The first plants that Coraline notices in the garden are pitcher plants, which lure insects in with their sweet-smelling nectar before trapping and devouring them. The Other Father's playful song that he performs for Coraline is laden with a hidden warning: ""we will never take our eyes off Coraline!"" You could watch this movie a dozen times and find some new detail every time.The voice work is also top-notch, particularly in Dakota Fanning providing a spunky (if a little bratty) Coraline and Keith David's melodious tones bringing to life the black cat that aids our heroine on her quest. But perhaps Terri Hatcher is the biggest surprise; best known for fairly light-weight roles, here she manages the sarcastic and weary droll of Coraline's real mother, and the sugary sweet refrain of her Other Mother...at least until things take a turn for the scary.Speaking of which, you might want to think twice before leaving your child alone with this movie. It can be immensely dark and scary at times - even for adults! But ultimately, it's a great adaptation of an equally great book, drawing upon all the best that the oldest fairy tales have to offer: a brave heroine, a scary monster, a threefold trial, and a happy ending.

1255577,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00288KNJU,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Coraline (Henry Selick, 2009)Henry Selick's greatest achievement until now is sadly neglected--the great The Nightmare Before Christmas. Why neglected, you ask? Because, thanks in large part to its stylistic tricks and the presence of Danny Elfman, ask ten fans of the movie who directed it, and you'll get nine people who say ""Tim Burton."" (Burton was actually the writer of the story upon which the movie is based, after a brilliant adaptation by Michael McDowell.) There can be little doubt that Burton had a profound influence on Selick, given his later work, but Selick has proven himself quite capable of standing on his own. Here, he partners up with another dark-fantasy great, Neil Gaiman, for an adaptation of one of Gaiman's finest novels, Coraline. And I have to say, this is the best film I saw on the big screen since El Laberinto del Fauno. Selick, who also wrote the screen adaptation, nails Gaiman's book in a way I wasn't sure could be done.Plot: Coraline (voice of Dakota Fanning) and her family move to a spooky old boardinghouse in the middle of nowhere thanks to her mother (voice of Teri Hatcher)'s new writing assignment. While she does make a tentative new friend, the nerdy Wybie (voice of The Happening's Robert Bailey Jr.), she's roundly unsatisfied with her home life, and wishes she could find something better. That night, she discovers a tunnel into an alternate dimension, where she meets analogues of her mother and father (voice of Daily Show regular John Hodgman) who seem to have no interest other than pleasing her. The only other denizen of the house who can travel between the two worlds is a cat (voice of Keith David), who cautions Coraline that not all is as it seems. Coraline is willing to forego warnings for cake, but with the help of some of the house's more eccentric inhabitants, Coraline discovers that not all is, in fact, as it seems.The house's other inhabitants are brought to life wonderfully, and with incredible talent (French and Saunders in fine form, Ian McShane), but it's Fanning and Bailey who steal the show here; they bring a magic to these characters that's rare even in live action. I tend to think of voicing animation as the opposite of silent film; rather than having no voice and having to get things across with exaggerated gesture, you have no gesture at all, and have to get things across with voice. Voice, however, is more subtle, and overdoing it can kill a movie (or a series, as anyone who's seen English-dubbed anime series can attest). Fanning has already proven herself an accomplished voice actress, but it's hard to believe this is Bailey's first outing. Good stuff, indeed. Hatcher is right at home playing a desperate housewife, of course, and French and Saunders just do what they do best, and it works. Heck, the whole cast have themselves a great time here, and it shows. It's all backed up with Selick's trademark creepy animation, that works just as well here as it did in The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. (It may be heresy, but I'll note it, at least in passing; the film is currently rated a tenth of a point higher at IMDB than is The Nightmare Before Christmas. Shocking!) As a side note, making Teri Hatcher's character look like, well, Teri Hatcher will be an extra kick for Desperate Housewives fans.In the afterword to the novel, Gaiman notes that while adults are likely to read it as a horror novel, children see it more as an adventure, and tend not to be scared by it. This is one aspect of the book that Selick didn't translate, and my thirteen-year-old daughter (who is rapidly becoming a connoisseur of bad horror films, just like her dad) was extremely creeped out by a few scenes towards the climax of the film. You may want to shoo the younger kiddies out of the room before watching this, but no matter. The adults will be just as charmed by it as the older kids will be. Maybe even more so. ****",4,A must-see.,1243814400,"06 1, 2009",2009,3936,"['Coraline', 'Henry', 'Selick', '2009', 'Henry', 'Selick', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'now', 'sadly', 'neglected', 'great', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'Why', 'neglected', 'ask', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'stylistic', 'tricks', 'presence', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'ask', 'ten', 'fans', 'movie', 'who', 'directed', ""'ll"", 'get', 'nine', 'people', 'who', 'say', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Burton', 'was', 'actually', 'writer', 'story', 'movie', 'based', 'brilliant', 'adaptation', 'Michael', 'McDowell', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'doubt', 'Burton', 'had', 'profound', 'influence', 'Selick', 'given', 'later', 'work', 'Selick', 'proven', 'quite', 'capable', 'standing', 'own', 'Here', 'partners', 'up', 'dark-fantasy', 'great', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'adaptation', 'one', 'Gaiman', 'finest', 'novels', 'Coraline', 'have', 'say', 'best', 'film', 'saw', 'big', 'screen', 'El', 'Laberinto', 'del', 'Fauno', 'Selick', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Gaiman', 'book', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'could', 'be', 'done.Plot', 'Coraline', 'voice', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'family', 'move', 'spooky', 'old', 'boardinghouse', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'thanks', 'mother', 'voice', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'new', 'writing', 'assignment', 'make', 'tentative', 'new', 'friend', 'nerdy', 'Wybie', 'voice', 'Happening', 'Robert', 'Bailey', 'Jr.', 'roundly', 'unsatisfied', 'home', 'life', 'could', 'find', 'something', 'better', 'night', 'tunnel', 'alternate', 'dimension', 'where', 'analogues', 'mother', 'father', 'voice', 'Daily', 'Show', 'regular', 'John', 'Hodgman', 'who', 'seem', 'have', 'interest', 'other', 'pleasing', 'only', 'other', 'denizen', 'house', 'who', 'can', 'travel', 'two', 'worlds', 'cat', 'voice', 'Keith', 'David', 'who', 'Coraline', 'not', 'Coraline', 'willing', 'forego', 'warnings', 'cake', 'help', 'house', 'more', 'eccentric', 'inhabitants', 'Coraline', 'not', 'fact', 'house', 'other', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'wonderfully', 'incredible', 'talent', 'French', 'Saunders', 'fine', 'form', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Fanning', 'Bailey', 'who', 'steal', 'show', 'here', 'bring', 'magic', 'characters', 'rare', 'even', 'live', 'action', 'tend', 'think', 'voicing', 'animation', 'opposite', 'silent', 'film', 'rather', 'having', 'voice', 'having', 'get', 'things', 'exaggerated', 'gesture', 'have', 'gesture', 'have', 'get', 'things', 'voice', 'Voice', 'however', 'more', 'subtle', 'overdoing', 'can', 'kill', 'movie', 'series', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'English-dubbed', 'anime', 'series', 'can', 'attest', 'Fanning', 'already', 'proven', 'accomplished', 'voice', 'actress', 'hard', 'believe', 'Bailey', 'first', 'outing', 'Good', 'stuff', 'indeed', 'Hatcher', 'right', 'home', 'playing', 'desperate', 'housewife', 'course', 'French', 'Saunders', 'just', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'Heck', 'whole', 'cast', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'here', 'backed', 'up', 'Selick', 'trademark', 'creepy', 'animation', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'here', 'did', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'James', 'Giant', 'Peach', 'may', 'be', 'heresy', ""'ll"", 'note', 'least', 'passing', 'film', 'currently', 'rated', 'tenth', 'point', 'higher', 'IMDB', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'Shocking', 'side', 'note', 'making', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'character', 'look', 'well', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'will', 'be', 'extra', 'kick', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'fans.In', 'afterword', 'novel', 'Gaiman', 'adults', 'are', 'likely', 'read', 'horror', 'novel', 'children', 'see', 'more', 'adventure', 'tend', 'not', 'be', 'scared', 'one', 'aspect', 'book', 'Selick', 'did', ""n't"", 'translate', 'thirteen-year-old', 'daughter', 'who', 'rapidly', 'becoming', 'connoisseur', 'bad', 'horror', 'films', 'just', 'dad', 'was', 'extremely', 'creeped', 'out', 'few', 'scenes', 'climax', 'film', 'may', 'want', 'shoo', 'younger', 'kiddies', 'room', 'watching', 'matter', 'adults', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'charmed', 'older', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'Maybe', 'even', 'more', 'so', '****']",N/A

Zwick,"[1, 2]","What self-respecting kid hasn't, at one time or another, wished for a different set of parents - you know the kind who wouldn't make you brush your teeth or eat your vegetables, and who would let you play in the mud and stay up late at night and have every single thing your greedy little heart could ask for?  Well, Coraline finds just such an alternate universe lurking in the corner of the rundown Victorian home that she and her consistently busy and utterly self-absorbed parents have just moved into - a magical world hidden behind a secret locked door where mice dance, cats talk and duplicate parents cater to a beloved child's every whim and fancy.  But as the old adage says, ""Be careful what you wish for"" - and soon Coraline is discovering, much to her dismay, that this ""perfect"" world and these ""perfect"" parents may not be quite so perfect after all.Based on the book by Neil Gaiman, ""Coraline"" is one of the most enchanting and visually arresting films to have come our way in quite some time.  Prime credit for its success goes to writer/director/production designer Henry Selick and his team of 3-D/stop-motion animation wizards who have created a world that is rooted in both reality and fantasy at one and the same time.  The triumph begins with the heroine herself, a feisty, naturally curious, no-nonsense kid whom any viewer, regardless of age, will be immediately drawn to.  As voiced by Dakota Fanning, Coraline is skeptical without being cynical, and her yearning for a mother and father who might actually pay a little attention to her could not be more universal in its appeal.  Like all good fantasies made for kids, ""Coraline"" finds its truths in its central character - in a lonely child who has been ripped away from her friends, and whose parents are so intensely focused on their own adult interests that they have no time to enter into the world of childish things that naturally concern her (people can`t even get her name right, since just about everyone insists on addressing her as Caroline).But all is not sweetness-and-light even in the bright and colorful ""other"" world that  Coraline visits - not by a long shot.  For the movie taps into many of those primal fears - of abandonment, of being seduced by evil with promises of goodies - that loom large in many of our most cherished folk stories and fairy tales.  Thus, since ""Coraline"" does venture into some pretty dark places, it might prove more than a little disturbing for very young audiences.  Older kids, on the other hand, will likely enjoy the creepiness and will surely find themselves rooting on this imaginative and resourceful little girl as she uses her courage and intellect to outwit those who would cause her harm.The animation is first-rate on every level.  The characters, with their sharp angles and spindly protuberances, look at times as if they'd just stepped out of a Tim Burton production - and the somber, nightmarish setting, with its dark skies and gnarly trees, conveys that impression as well (not really much of a surprise, actually, since Selick was the director of Burton`s ""Nightmare Before Christmas"").  Yet, ""Coraline"" never feels derivative of other movies; it is instead a wholly original and beautifully crafted work in its own right - and one you would be foolish and improvident in the extreme to miss out on.",4,"Classic spin on ""Be careful what you wish for""",1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,3343,"['What', 'self-respecting', 'kid', ""n't"", 'one', 'time', 'wished', 'different', 'set', 'parents', 'know', 'kind', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'brush', 'teeth', 'eat', 'vegetables', 'who', 'would', 'let', 'play', 'mud', 'stay', 'up', 'late', 'night', 'have', 'single', 'thing', 'greedy', 'little', 'heart', 'could', 'ask', 'Well', 'Coraline', 'just', 'such', 'alternate', 'universe', 'lurking', 'corner', 'rundown', 'Victorian', 'home', 'consistently', 'busy', 'utterly', 'self-absorbed', 'parents', 'have', 'just', 'moved', 'magical', 'world', 'hidden', 'secret', 'locked', 'door', 'where', 'mice', 'dance', 'cats', 'talk', 'duplicate', 'parents', 'cater', 'beloved', 'child', 'whim', 'fancy', 'old', 'adage', 'Be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'soon', 'Coraline', 'discovering', 'much', 'dismay', 'perfect', 'world', 'perfect', 'parents', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'so', 'perfect', 'all.Based', 'book', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'Coraline', 'one', 'most', 'enchanting', 'visually', 'arresting', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'way', 'quite', 'time', 'Prime', 'credit', 'success', 'writer/director/production', 'designer', 'Henry', 'Selick', 'team', '3-D/stop-motion', 'animation', 'wizards', 'who', 'have', 'created', 'world', 'rooted', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'one', 'same', 'time', 'triumph', 'heroine', 'feisty', 'naturally', 'curious', 'no-nonsense', 'kid', 'whom', 'viewer', 'regardless', 'age', 'will', 'be', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'voiced', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Coraline', 'skeptical', 'being', 'cynical', 'yearning', 'mother', 'father', 'who', 'might', 'actually', 'pay', 'little', 'attention', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'universal', 'appeal', 'good', 'fantasies', 'made', 'kids', 'Coraline', 'truths', 'central', 'character', 'lonely', 'child', 'who', 'been', 'ripped', 'away', 'friends', 'parents', 'are', 'so', 'intensely', 'focused', 'own', 'adult', 'interests', 'have', 'time', 'enter', 'world', 'childish', 'things', 'naturally', 'concern', 'people', 'can', 't', 'even', 'get', 'name', 'right', 'just', 'everyone', 'insists', 'addressing', 'Caroline', '.But', 'not', 'sweetness-and-light', 'even', 'bright', 'colorful', 'other', 'world', 'Coraline', 'not', 'long', 'shot', 'movie', 'many', 'primal', 'fears', 'abandonment', 'being', 'seduced', 'evil', 'promises', 'goodies', 'loom', 'large', 'many', 'most', 'cherished', 'folk', 'stories', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Thus', 'Coraline', 'venture', 'pretty', 'dark', 'places', 'might', 'prove', 'more', 'little', 'disturbing', 'very', 'young', 'audiences', 'Older', 'kids', 'other', 'hand', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'creepiness', 'will', 'surely', 'find', 'rooting', 'imaginative', 'resourceful', 'little', 'girl', 'courage', 'intellect', 'outwit', 'who', 'would', 'cause', 'harm.The', 'animation', 'first-rate', 'level', 'characters', 'sharp', 'angles', 'spindly', 'protuberances', 'look', 'times', ""'d"", 'just', 'stepped', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'production', 'somber', 'nightmarish', 'setting', 'dark', 'skies', 'gnarly', 'trees', 'conveys', 'impression', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'surprise', 'actually', 'Selick', 'was', 'director', 'Burton', 's', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'Coraline', 'never', 'derivative', 'other', 'movies', 'instead', 'wholly', 'original', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'work', 'own', 'right', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'improvident', 'extreme', 'miss', 'out']",N/A

A valid example of the animation 'revolution' that is truly effective. A clever story that isn't just an excuse for a gang of actors to get together and do voice-overs, stuck in some crazy premise; this was based on a children's book and had a reason for being rather than just silly fart joke laughs. The characters are believable, quirky souls, who seem exotic and interesting rather than the rubber-stamped kiddie flick creations we've seen so often.The colors are realistic, and duplicate the overall feel of the original version. I'm not so sure that the Blu-Ray process is really needed as there is no need for the super contrast and dazzling color pallet that those discs provide. I haven't compared the digital copy with the Blu-Ray, so I don't know how specifically, they differ, but I image the difference is minimal.The film itself is a charming little story with a lot inventive twists and turns and a spectacular visual style that survives on the flat version much better than the stereo one. I see that, apparently, UP won't have the 3-D option when it makes it's debut, later in the year. That is no loss, believe me.The 3-D effects, which were so dazzling in the theatre, are lost on this disc. Although the process has been improved enormously since the fifties, the attempts used to duplicate it on video are the same very lame red lens/green lens process used on comic books of that era, and mid '70s tv broadcasts. It is ugly and more annoying than effective.It is recommended that one allow one's eyes to adjust to the process, but no amount of waiting will help this look less than ugly.

Other than the cat, she really has no friends, and this doesn't really change throughout the story. It's a central element in the novel. So how do we handle this in Hollywood? We add an extraneous male character as a kind of ""friend"" for Coraline. This male character (Wybee short for ""Whyborn?"" which they got that right, as he has absolutely no purpose in the story) shows up at the beginning of the film, intermittently in the ""other"" world with button eyes, and finally swoops down on his RV just in time to save Coraline at the very end. In the book Coraline figures out how to wrap things up on her own.  Maybe this ending wasn't dramatic enough for the movies, but it was a hell of a lot more satisfying. So add sexist to pointless. We couldn't have a smart capable heroine solve her problems without male help, now could we?The movie has a lot of good effects and spooky atmospherics which is why I gave it 2 stars, but the pointless vandalism committed on the book and the implications of those changes ruined the experience for me.

You have a two disc set that contains a 2D, 3D, DVD copy, Dig Copy, an hour of special features in 1080i, Dbox, and the usual mix of BD Live options from Universal.I watched this with my kids both that are under 10, and contrary to what anyone says as a shock tactic, this movie was not a horror flick. It was a great animation film with a solid story that looked outstanding on Blu. Having both copies readily available, I compared several scenes to prove the vibrancy, colors, and clarity were greatly improved with BD, even with it being this type of animation. The 3D version loses the usual color palette, but looked great compared to other 3D out of late.The DTS was mixed eloquently, and more times than not they managed to use all five channels with much more frequency that can be done with a live action film. So after enjoying a fun film (ignore the naysayers here) we spent an hour going over the supplements.The making-of lasts 36 minutes and contains many smaller features that do have the Play All option. After watching the Voicing Of (10:46), the strangely edited deleted scenes (8:47) and the Creepy Coraline (5:30) segment I almost side with splitting between the features that you find the most interesting. The deleted scenes are bizarre in how they edited in the director's facial contortions and the ten 1-2 seconds blips as ""needing to be cut"" - whatever. Some great information either way regarding the time it took to make certain sequences. Have not had a chance to utilize the DBOX option or the BD live features for this one. The usual Universe U Control option is available to you if your player is all tuned up for doing the PiP and such.The clarity, colors, sound, supplements, and extra copies all make for a worthwhile product purchase, especially for as low in price as it has gotten in the last week.

Upon closely examining Coraline's storyline however, one can find a rather poorly developed villain and numerous plot devices that give the young adventurer far too much help, consequently reducing the severity and intensity of her trials.  But at least everything looks fantastic.Having just moved to the eerily isolated Pink Palace Apartments, and being consistently ignored by her parents, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) finds herself terribly bored.  But all that changes when she discovers a mysterious hidden doorway that leads to an alternate world - one that parallels her own but seems much better.  In this other reality Coraline finds what she believes she's always wanted, but she soon learns just how deceptive appearances can be...At first her visits to the other world seem like dreams - she has a more loving, playful mother, an exciting father who actually likes gardening (something Coraline enjoys) and amazing food, instead of the goop she's usually served. Even the eccentric next-door circus ringleader Mr. Bobinsky is more jubilant and the dramatic theater-loving neighbors Miss Spink and Miss Forcible are entertaining. While every ""Other"" character has improved, each one has buttons instead of eyes. And the catch becomes apparent when the Other Mother insists that Coraline adopt button eyes of her own.It's darker and more sinister than Henry Selick's previous stop-motion films James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas, but has familiar elements from the visionary mind of Neil Gaiman. It's like a darker, twisted version of Alice in Wonderland, complete with a talking cat. The atmosphere is splendidly enchanting, the environment is unique and the visuals are top-notch. The animation is also seamlessly blended between puppets, extravagant sets and computer graphics. The pacing, however, is a little slow and the production as a whole doesn't succeed as a family film (or even a children's movie) due to its unnerving plot.  And while our heroine receives plenty of attention, the villain's backstory is mysteriously absent, leaving one wondering the point of orchestrating such an elaborate facade.Coraline debuts in 3D, but overall doesn't take advantage of the technology. Objects don't jump out from the screen, and few scares are derived from poking into the third dimension. If 3D isn't available in your area, don't worry - you're not missing much.- The Massie Twins",3,Coraline Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,2657,"['Insanely', 'inventive', 'characters', 'generous', 'helping', 'darkly', 'macabre', 'visuals', 'permeate', 'facet', 'Coraline', 'wildly', 'imaginative', 'world', 'created', 'certainly', 'overshadow', 'shortcomings', 'film', 'story', 'pacing', 'closely', 'examining', 'Coraline', 'storyline', 'however', 'one', 'can', 'find', 'rather', 'poorly', 'developed', 'villain', 'numerous', 'plot', 'devices', 'give', 'young', 'adventurer', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'help', 'consequently', 'reducing', 'severity', 'intensity', 'trials', 'least', 'everything', 'fantastic.Having', 'just', 'moved', 'eerily', 'isolated', 'Pink', 'Palace', 'Apartments', 'being', 'consistently', 'ignored', 'parents', 'Coraline', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'terribly', 'bored', 'changes', 'when', 'mysterious', 'hidden', 'doorway', 'alternate', 'world', 'one', 'own', 'much', 'better', 'other', 'reality', 'Coraline', 'what', 'always', 'wanted', 'soon', 'just', 'how', 'deceptive', 'appearances', 'can', 'be', 'first', 'visits', 'other', 'world', 'seem', 'dreams', 'more', 'loving', 'playful', 'mother', 'exciting', 'father', 'who', 'actually', 'gardening', 'something', 'Coraline', 'amazing', 'food', 'instead', 'goop', 'usually', 'served', 'Even', 'eccentric', 'next-door', 'circus', 'Mr.', 'Bobinsky', 'more', 'jubilant', 'dramatic', 'theater-loving', 'neighbors', 'Miss', 'Spink', 'Miss', 'Forcible', 'are', 'entertaining', 'Other', 'character', 'improved', 'one', 'buttons', 'instead', 'eyes', 'catch', 'apparent', 'when', 'Other', 'Mother', 'Coraline', 'adopt', 'button', 'eyes', 'own.It', 'darker', 'more', 'sinister', 'Henry', 'Selick', 'previous', 'stop-motion', 'films', 'James', 'Giant', 'Peach', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'familiar', 'elements', 'visionary', 'mind', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'darker', 'twisted', 'version', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'complete', 'talking', 'cat', 'atmosphere', 'splendidly', 'enchanting', 'environment', 'unique', 'visuals', 'are', 'top-notch', 'animation', 'also', 'seamlessly', 'blended', 'puppets', 'extravagant', 'sets', 'computer', 'graphics', 'pacing', 'however', 'little', 'slow', 'production', 'whole', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'family', 'film', 'even', 'children', 'movie', 'due', 'unnerving', 'plot', 'heroine', 'plenty', 'attention', 'villain', 'backstory', 'mysteriously', 'absent', 'leaving', 'one', 'wondering', 'point', 'orchestrating', 'such', 'elaborate', 'facade.Coraline', 'debuts', '3D', 'overall', ""n't"", 'take', 'advantage', 'technology', 'Objects', 'do', ""n't"", 'jump', 'out', 'screen', 'few', 'scares', 'are', 'derived', 'poking', 'third', 'dimension', '3D', ""n't"", 'available', 'area', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'re"", 'not', 'missing', 'much.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

So imaginative,creepy, beautiful, wonderful storytelling. I thought it had the right balance of dark where kids ages 8 to 13 would like it, other than that under 8 might find it a little scary. As a big movie fan and fanboy the animation was great, colors were vibrant where it needed and drab when needing to be drab. And watching it in 3D was a really cool. If you like Corpse Bride, Nightmare Before Christmas, beautiful imagery even if it is of animation kind then see this. Adults will enjoy it!

1255611,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00288KNJU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[9, 11]","Every so often, you see a film so special, so different, you can't help but count the moments until the film officially becomes a Classic. Such is the case with ""Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas"". Tim Burton, working with director Henry Selick, conceived a story so unique and original, most people were instantly transfixed and captivated by the new characters and the magical quality of the film. The film has rightfully earned the title of  ""Classic"", enjoying limited re-release every year near Halloween. Disneyland transforms the Haunted Mansion every year, inviting Jack Skellington, Zero, Oogie Boogie and Sandy Claus to make appearances throughout the venerable ride. A couple of years ago, the film was converted to 3-D, and now it is a very different experience to see the film in theaters. It is, of course, also available on DVD. Burton and Selick followed ""Nightmare"" with an adaptation of Roald Dahl's ""James and the Giant Peach"". It's very good, but not really a classic.A number of years later, each of the director's made a new entry in the stop- motion animation genre. Tim Burton, working with another director, created ""Corpse Bride"". And Selick chose to make the live action - stop motion hybrid called ""Monkeybone"" starring Brendan Fraser and Whoopi Goldberg, among many others.Both of these films lack a crucial element making the material flawed, at best, and downright awful at worst. What is that crucial element? The other half of the team. In ""Corpse Bride"", Burton's unique visual style is fully evident and the film is stunning visually. This is really no surprise for a Tim Burton film. All of his films have a stunning, fable like visual quality. But like all of Burton's films, ""Corpse Bride"" really falters in the storytelling. ""Monkey Bone"" is, quite simply, a dreadful film. Selick clearly can't guide the human actors as well as he can a puppet and all of the acting is dreadful. Considering the stop motion animation is relegated to a supporting role in this film, the worst part of the film takes center stage.Now, both directors are returning with new stop motion animation projects. Selick returns as writer and director of ""Coraline"", based on a book by Neil Gaiman, and presented in 3-D. Burton teams with Timur Babmenetkov, director of the Russian films ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch"", to bring us ""9"", a film that appears to be about robot figures trying to rebuild a post-apocalyptic Earth. It will be released on 9-9-09.""Coraline"", written and directed by Selick, is as close to a magical film as I have seen in a number of years. I would definitely recommend seeking out a theater showing the film in 3-D. The film doesn't contain a lot of 3-D tricks, hands and objects flying at the screen so the audience will have the effect of the item flying at them, and 3-D isn't necessary to enjoy the film, but it adds such a depth to the story and the visuals that I can only imagine the film would be completely different without the 3-D glasses. The backgrounds and characters seem to belong in the real world and we get to experience a little of this thanks to the addition of 3-D.Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) and her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman, ""The Daily Show withy Jon Stewart"") move to a new apartment in a dreary old building in the middle of a large field almost completely devoid of both color and plant life. Bored, Coraline tries to get her parents to go on a walk, or to play with her, to do anything, But they are both so busy writing their new gardening catalog (and each hates touching dirt) that they start to get upset with her for being a nuisance. She decides to explore the house and the grounds and soon meets Whybie, the grandson of Coraline's new landlord. As she continues to explore, she meets the elderly British sisters, Miss Forcible and Miss Spink (Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders), former vaudevillians, who live upstairs and a former Russian gymnast, Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane, HBO's ""Deadwood"", ""Deathrace"") who lives downstairs. She soon finds a small door behind some wallpaper. It's locked, but her annoyed mom is only too glad to open it, anything to stop her daughter from nagging. As Coraline peers inside. She finds a passageway to a parallel world. In this new world, her mom and dad are very attentive and loving, seeking to entertain her all the time. The apartment is bright and colorful. The gardens are overgrown with colorful flowers. A little Scottish Terrier (Keith David) talks. It seems like everything in this new world is designed to make her happy. All Coraline has to do to make her stay in this world permanent is to adapt to it completely and make herself look just like everyone else. And everyone else has black buttons sewn in where their eyes should be.""Coraline"", based on a book by Neil Gaiman, has a dark, fairy tale quality that really helps to set it apart, to make it a little special. All of the best animated films and the best fairy tales are at least a little dark. All of Roald Dahl's children's books have a slightly sinister quality to them; parents die leaving children in strange circumstances or children find escape in slightly sinister adults. Gaiman borrows this quality, bringing a darkness to Coraline's world, both literally and figuratively. Coralline has both of her parents, but she maybe wishes she didn't because all they seem to care about is work leaving her to entertain herself.When the Jones family moves into their new apartment, Coraline is shocked to find everything so dark and gray and devoid of character. The entire apartment building appears to have seen no sunlight in decades, everything in covered in a gray pallor. When she goes outside to explore, an overcast sky prompts her to wear a rain slicker. But the area looks so devoid of life we have to wonder if the sun has taken a permanent vacation from the area. When she meets Whybie, he doesn't seem to realize there is an alternative because he is so used to the barren landscape.As in any fable, there has to be an alternative, either good or bad. And in ""Coraline"", the alternative initially appears very good to the little girl. She follows a secret passageway and ends up in a complete copy of her apartment. It is exactly the same in every way except that it is colorful, furnished with comfortable, homey furnishings and her parents seem particularly intent on making sure their daughter is having fun. In other words, she recognizes it because it is the same, but she is shocked because it is so completely different. She also finds that animals talk in this new world, plants grow and seem to perform and her mom seems particularly interested in making sure her daughter is happy. But as the poster for the film says, ""Be careful what you wish for"".Selick and his team do an amazing job of giving each character a distinctive look and personality. And this attention to detail continues throughout every aspect of the environment and story. As Coraline explores the family's new apartment, she looks very large in hallways and small and insignificant in some of the huge, high ceiling rooms. It is a nice way of illustrating how foreign the environment is to her, how much she feels like an alien in these new surroundings.The large Victorian that houses her family's new apartment is also particularly dark, spooky and unwelcoming. So when Coraline enters the alternative world and everything is painted in deep, but vibrant colors, and everyone seems so welcoming, she dives into the new world.Not only are her parents very different, but her neighbors are also different. Whybie tries to warn her, but soon, he appears with buttons as eyes and seems much more complacent. Coraline finds a theater in the building and watches an extended performance by the British sisters, the highlight of which is a reenactment of ""The Birth of Venus"" by the two women and one of the very buxom sisters appears wearing nothing but some pasties and a very small bikini bottom.""Coraline"" has much to discover that I could go on for pages and pages, but that would ruin a lot of the fun. It is better for you to discover it on your own.I will say that I think ""Coraline"" is a great film for families with kids over a certain age. The film has some dark elements that might scare some younger kids and even though this is an animated film, if you take very young kids to see it, you'll only have to leave the theater early when they get scared. I know some parents have difficulty taking their kids to films like ""Curious George"". If this is you, stay away from ""Coraline"". But if your kids are, oh, at least 10, this is a great choice for the whole family because there is something for everyone to enjoy and delight in.I hope this film quickly earns the title it deserves allowing it to be enjoyed by generations to come.",5,Darkly Creepy and Delightful,1234915200,"02 18, 2009",2009,8842,"['so', 'often', 'see', 'film', 'so', 'special', 'so', 'different', 'ca', ""n't"",

This is a modern-day adventure of Alice-like spirited heroine encountering these eccentric characters in another universe, some of which could be as terrifying as the head-chopping Queen of Hearts.Coraline Jones (voice by Dakota Fanning) has recently moved in the 150-year-old Pink Palace Apartments. The 11-year-old girl has no friends to talk to, except a slightly nervous boy ""Wybie"" (Robert Bailey, Jr.). And Coraline's parents Charlie (voice by John Hodgman) and Mel (voice by Teri Hatcher) are too busy.But Coraline, an independent, intelligent and curious girl, finds a strange door while exploring the old house. She then discovers a big secret about it. Through the door, only at night, she can go to the ""other"" world, where she meets the ""Other Mother"" and the ""Other Father."" The other parents are caring and loving - and the Other Father, always delightful, is an incredibly gifted pianist!It is only natural that Coraline starts visiting the other world frequently.

1255615,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00288KNJU,Turfseer,"[12, 19]","Coraline is a film that employs computer enhanced stop action animation. So visually it's sort of a combination of the old and the new. What's more, some theaters show it in 3-D and it was neat wearing the special glasses and occasionally being startled as images seem to be jumping out right off from the screen itself.Coraline, a young girl, who seems to be around eight or nine years old, has just moved into an old house with her parents, who can best be described as workaholics. While Coraline doesn't really dislike her parents, she feels a bit disconnected from them. The old house they've moved into is connected to a few other old houses which are occupied by some older neighbors who are flaming eccentrics (there's Mr. Bobinsky, a retired circus master and Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, elderly and rather plump opera buffs). Also in the mix is a local kid, Wybie, who Coraline finds exceptionally annoying (mainly because he talks too much).Coraline is very similar to Alice in Wonderland since there is a secret portal in the house which leads to a different world--an alternate universe. Coraline follows a mouse through the portal and discovers her ""other"" mother and father. They look exactly the same except they have buttons for eyes. At first, Coraline is seduced by everything the new parents have to offer. She's treated to sumptuous meals and given a tour of a garden outside the house which is full of fantastic creatures which Coraline finds enchanting.The Coraline story loses quite a bit of energy and focus in the first hour when she enters the secret world and then goes back to her ordinary world more than once. Contrast that with a story such as the Wizard of Oz--when Dorothy enters the fantasy world of Oz , she remains there until the climax of the film. By remaining in the new extraordinary world, the protagonist now has the opportunity to be tested and go up against an evil opposing force. From the beginning of Oz, there is an arc of increasing tension which culminates in the final confrontation with the all powerful Wizard.In contrast, the tension in Coraline doesn't really become palpable until the second half of the film. That's when the 'other' parents suddenly become malevolent and attempt to imprison Coraline in their world for the rest of eternity. Where Dorothy has three charming sidekicks (The Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion) to aid her in her battle against the wicked witch, the 'other mother' in Coraline has taken Wybie's power of speech away from him--which deprives Coraline from having a sidekick to battle the forces of evil in the other world (instead, a talking cat is substituted but we feel no emotional connection to that character). I would have liked the real Wybie to have somehow made his way through the portal and helped Coraline in her quest to escape or defeat the other mother.There also didn't seem to be enough of a contrast between the eccentric neighbors in the real world and the fantasy world. Mr. Bobinsky seemed to be contorting himself all over the place BEFORE Coraline finds him leading his group of dancing mice in the alternate universe. The same goes for Miss Sprink and Miss Forcible who seem equally weird in both worlds.In the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy's alienation from her family occurs after Auntie Em is unable to prevent Miss Gulch from taking Toto away from her. In contrast, the alienation between Coraline and her parents is only vaguely defined (somehow, the parents' preoccupation with their own work doesn't seem to be a strong enough reason for Coraline to be alienated from them). Somehow, there needed to be a much more compelling reason for Coraline to initially consider accepting her 'other' parents'. In other words, the stakes simply aren't high enough.In the end, Coraline suffers from a lack of originality. It's a story that we've seen too many times before without enough new twists. Furthermore, the characters (including Coraline) aren't CONSISTENTLY charming enough to engage us emotionally. Coraline has some great special effects and art design and I would recommend seeing it on that basis alone. But unfortunately one must also focus on the story, which clearly has not fulfilled its potential.",3,Storyline fails to fulfill its potential despite excellent animation,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,4213,"['Coraline', 'film', 'computer', 'enhanced', 'stop', 'action', 'animation', 'So', 'visually', 'sort', 'combination', 'old', 'new', 'What', 'more', 'theaters', 'show', '3-D', 'was', 'neat', 'wearing', 'special', 'glasses', 'occasionally', 'being', 'startled', 'images', 'seem', 'be', 'jumping', 'out', 'right', 'screen', 'itself.Coraline', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'around', 'eight', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'just', 'moved', 'old', 'house', 'parents', 'who', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'workaholics', 'Coraline', ""n't"", 'really', 'dislike', 'parents', 'bit', 'disconnected', 'old', 'house', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'connected', 'few', 'other', 'old', 'houses', 'are', 'occupied', 'older', 'neighbors', 'who', 'are', 'flaming', 'eccentrics', 'Mr.', 'Bobinsky', 'retired', 'circus', 'master', 'Miss', 'Spink', 'Miss', 'Forcible', 'elderly', 'rather', 'plump', 'opera', 'buffs', 'Also', 'mix', 'local', 'kid', 'Wybie', 'who', 'Coraline', 'exceptionally', 'annoying', 'mainly', 'too', 'much', '.Coraline', 'very', 'similar', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'secret', 'portal', 'house', 'different', 'world', 'alternate', 'universe', 'Coraline', 'mouse', 'portal', 'other', 'mother', 'father', 'look', 'exactly', 'same', 'have', 'buttons', 'eyes', 'first', 'Coraline', 'seduced', 'everything', 'new', 'parents', 'have', 'offer', 'treated', 'sumptuous', 'meals', 'given', 'tour', 'garden', 'house', 'full', 'fantastic', 'creatures', 'Coraline', 'enchanting.The', 'Coraline', 'story', 'quite', 'bit', 'energy', 'focus', 'first', 'hour', 'when', 'secret', 'world', 'then', 'back', 'ordinary', 'world', 'more', 'once', 'Contrast', 'story', 'such', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'when', 'Dorothy', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Oz', 'there', 'climax', 'film', 'remaining', 'new', 'extraordinary', 'world', 'protagonist', 'now', 'opportunity', 'be', 'tested', 'go', 'up', 'evil', 'opposing', 'force', 'beginning', 'Oz', 'arc', 'increasing', 'tension', 'final', 'confrontation', 'powerful', 'Wizard.In', 'contrast', 'tension', 'Coraline', ""n't"", 'really', 'become', 'palpable', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'when', ""'other"", 'parents', 'suddenly', 'become', 'malevolent', 'attempt', 'imprison', 'Coraline', 'world', 'rest', 'eternity', 'Where', 'Dorothy', 'three', 'charming', 'sidekicks', 'Scarecrow', 'Tin', 'Man', 'Lion', 'aid', 'battle', 'wicked', 'witch', ""'other"", 'mother', 'Coraline', 'taken', 'Wybie', 'power', 'speech', 'away', 'Coraline', 'having', 'sidekick', 'battle', 'forces', 'evil', 'other', 'world', 'instead', 'talking', 'cat', 'substituted', 'feel', 'emotional', 'connection', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'real', 'Wybie', 'have', 'somehow', 'made', 'way', 'portal', 'helped', 'Coraline', 'quest', 'escape', 'defeat', 'other', 'mother.There', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'enough', 'contrast', 'eccentric', 'neighbors', 'real', 'world', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Mr.', 'Bobinsky', 'seemed', 'be', 'contorting', 'place', 'BEFORE', 'Coraline', 'leading', 'group', 'dancing', 'mice', 'alternate', 'universe', 'same', 'Miss', 'Sprink', 'Miss', 'Forcible', 'who', 'seem', 'equally', 'weird', 'worlds.In', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'Dorothy', 'alienation', 'family', 'Auntie', 'Em', 'unable', 'prevent', 'Miss', 'Gulch', 'taking', 'Toto', 'away', 'contrast', 'alienation', 'Coraline', 'parents', 'only', 'vaguely', 'defined', 'somehow', 'parents', 'preoccupation', 'own', 'work', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'strong', 'enough', 'reason', 'Coraline', 'be', 'alienated', 'Somehow', 'needed', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'reason', 'Coraline', 'initially', 'consider', 'accepting', ""'other"", 'parents', 'other', 'words', 'stakes', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'high', 'enough.In', 'end', 'Coraline', 'suffers', 'lack', 'originality', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'enough', 'new', 'twists', 'Furthermore', 'characters', 'including', 'Coraline', 'are', ""n't"", 'CONSISTENTLY', 'charming', 'enough', 'engage', 'emotionally', 'Coraline', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'art', 'design', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'basis', 'alone', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'must', 'also', 'focus', 'story', 'clearly', 'not', 'fulfilled', 'potential']",N/A

Coraline starts off irritated with her new situation: her apartment is boring, her neighbors are bizarre, and her parents are negligent and obsessed with work. When Coraline dreams, she goes through a little door leading to a world, where her &#34;Other&#34; Mother and Father live, and everything she finds bad or boring in her real life becomes extraordinary. Each time she wakes up more frustrated with the real world, but eventually, she starts to find that something is off with the world behind the door.I've seen Coraline described as Alice in Wonderland meets The Nightmare Before Christmas, and I think that's a very fitting comparison, when talking about the story and visual style. This certainly has Tim Burton's signature style, which I always want to love, but I never quite feel like I &#34;get&#34;. Still, I do like Coraline for what it is. The visuals are quite cool and, sometimes, lovely, even in their strangeness. I have a great affinity for the music. I also love the story, which I'm guessing is mostly to Neil Gaiman's credit, though I've yet to read the book to see how closely the movie sticks to the original story.There are a few things to keep in mind if getting this movie for a child. It can be quite disturbing and scary at times, and if I had watched it at a young age, I think I'd be quite scared.

Her busy parents don't have much time for her, though, and her new, remote home doesn't offer much reward for her explorations (other than some rather kooky neighbors). So, even if it's not wholly conscious, Coraline wishes for a nicer place and parents that pay more attention.As the movie's tagline says, ""be careful what you wish for."" Like Alice down the rabbit hole, Coraline finds a secret passage to a more magical place. Soon, however, the magic turns dark. That's where the brilliant animation really comes into its own. The stop animation (or at least the look of it) bring to mind Tim Burton with a macabre touch of Brothers Quay. You know your child best - skittish ones might find some of the imagery a bit much. Still, kids' stories (like Alice in Wonderland) have always had dark edges.

The quality of the story telling and the imagination used to realize this world in such a unique way should really be praised. I can't really criticize the movie for being dark or intense because it never claims to not be. It should be noted that younger kids (under 10yrs) may find some of the scenes really scary because the main villain imprisons Coraline's parents at one point. I think of this film as having the same vibe as early Jim Henson fantasy movies such as the Dark Crystal or Labyrinth.I really loved this movie and now wished I had purchased it rather than simply rented it from Amazon's fantastic instant streaming service.,4,Imaginative,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,685,"['am', 'so', 'happy', 'got', 'see', 'Coraline', 'finally', 'quality', 'story', 'telling', 'imagination', 'used', 'realize', 'world', 'such', 'unique', 'way', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'praised', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'criticize', 'movie', 'being', 'dark', 'intense', 'never', 'not', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'younger', 'kids', '10yrs', 'may', 'find', 'scenes', 'really', 'scary', 'main', 'villain', 'imprisons', 'Coraline', 'parents', 'one', 'point', 'think', 'film', 'having', 'same', 'vibe', 'early', 'Jim', 'Henson', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'such', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'Labyrinth.I', 'really', 'loved', 'movie', 'now', 'wished', 'had', 'purchased', 'rather', 'simply', 'rented', 'Amazon', 'fantastic', 'instant', 'streaming', 'service']",N/A

Coraline is the darkest of all the ""scary"" flicks we've watched this October, but we watched it together, discussed various aspects whenever she had a question, and surprisingly she did not find it scary though she did comment on some parts being creepy. I think for her age, she probably did not quite grasp some of the darker aspects of the movie, but she did get the gist of the movie, and the message behind it.Coraline's story bears the message ""the grass is not always greener on the other side."" Coraline complains about her life with her parents, at not being able to do what she wants, when she wants, blah blah blah. Until one day, she discovers a door or portal into another world, where everything seems so much better, just like her present life, only more interesting and appealing. Of course there's a catch, and the seemingly ""benign"" mother figure in this other world soon turns out to be vile and wicked with an evil agenda - to keep Coraline trapped with her forever, as with all the other lost children. Coraline discovers that not only does she have to escape this evil entity's clutches, but also save her parents who have become trapped in another world, and free the souls of the captive children.The animation is unique and interesting and fascinated both my daughter and myself. I certainly think this is a movie that is more appropriate for older children, ages 8 and up, but with parental supervision and guidance, it can be appreciated by a younger child. It certainly brought up some interesting issues for discussion between my daughter and I. Intelligent, well-scripted (and based on Neil Gaiman's novel), this is a movie I'm adding to our DVD library. Now if only Gaiman'sThe Graveyard Book (Hardcover)would be brought to screen!",4,Unique storyline and interesting animation make this a keeper,1319846400,"10 29, 2011",2011,1899,"['first', 'grader', 'inherited', 'affinity', 'scary', 'flicks', 'course', 'been', 'exposed', 'kid-friendly', 'variety', 'Coraline', 'darkest', 'scary', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'October', 'watched', 'together', 'discussed', 'various', 'aspects', 'whenever', 'had', 'question', 'surprisingly', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'scary', 'did', 'comment', 'parts', 'being', 'creepy', 'think', 'age', 'probably', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'grasp', 'darker', 'aspects', 'movie', 'did', 'get', 'gist', 'movie', 'message', 'it.Coraline', 'story', 'message', 'grass', 'not', 'always', 'greener', 'other', 'side', 'Coraline', 'life', 'parents', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'do', 'what', 'when', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'one', 'day', 'door', 'portal', 'world', 'where', 'everything', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'just', 'present', 'life', 'only', 'more', 'interesting', 'appealing', 'course', 'catch', 'seemingly', 'benign', 'mother', 'figure', 'other', 'world', 'soon', 'out', 'be', 'vile', 'wicked', 'evil', 'agenda', 'keep', 'Coraline', 'trapped', 'forever', 'other', 'lost', 'children', 'Coraline', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'escape', 'evil', 'entity', 'clutches', 'also', 'save', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'trapped', 'world', 'free', 'souls', 'captive', 'children.The', 'animation', 'unique', 'interesting', 'fascinated', 'daughter', 'certainly', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'appropriate', 'older', 'children', '8', 'up', 'parental', 'supervision', 'guidance', 'can', 'be', 'appreciated', 'younger', 'child', 'certainly', 'brought', 'up', 'interesting', 'issues', 'discussion', 'daughter', 'Intelligent', 'well-scripted', 'based', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'novel', 'movie', ""'m"", 'adding', 'DVD', 'library', 'Now', 'only', ""Gaiman'sThe"", 'Graveyard', 'Book', 'Hardcover', 'would', 'be', 'brought', 'screen']",N/A

I would have rather had the voices in Coraline British, rather than English, it would have made the film a bit more mystical and intelligent sounding.  The plot was a bit confusing, you really have to pay attention.  I was more fixated on the beautiful, organic animation and vivid colours.
