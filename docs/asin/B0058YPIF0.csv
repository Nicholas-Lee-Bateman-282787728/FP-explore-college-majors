1445979,A2K6XRL5PUKWJ9,B0058YPIF0,abbyjo,"[1, 20]","Dialogue paraphrase from parenthood season 3 Episode 11, ""Missing"" is missing a reality check.  This script is 100% Hollywood.In this reviewer's humble opinion (ITRHO) the family's total self righteous over reaction when ""Max"" who is at least 13 or 14 years old by season 3 (he was 11 in season 1?) dares to go out on his very own by his own self on public transit without a BABYsitter.  (Barf, how is he supposed to GROW UP? OR IS HE?) In this televised melodrama for instant download and oooh....aaah....he's...AUTISTIC.  First of all, down one star for not having closed captions, amazon.com, shame, shame.Okay, so back to ""Max.""  Max is ""AUTISTIC"" (the new catchall for does not fit in...used to be ADHD, before that it was ""geek,"" ""retard"" before that it was ""contaminated,"" See ""Glee"" for more....)So, back to ""Max.""  Max the AUTISTIC nevertheless manages to get to downtown Oakland from somewhere in N. Berkeley Hills by himself on MUNI buses and BART.  He asks nothing, other than polite directions to the museum, looks like he was headed to the Exploratorium.Dax (not his real name to protect privacy) went there when he was 4.  He got bored with it by the time he was 6, whereupon we began going to the San Jose version of the Exploratorium a slightly more high tech place...The Tech? I remember parking was easier in San Jose.So, back to ""Max,"" the TV character, who at 14 wanted to go to The Exploratorium, a place where Dax, my son, (not his real name to protect his privacy) got bored when he was 6.  We are asked to believe that the yuppie parents freak out because this 14 year old boy goes missing for about 30 minutes in the middle of the day.  We are further asked to believe that Berkeley PD would do something about it within 30 minutes.  Then we are asked to believe that Oakland PD actually found a quiet unassuming independent tall Caucasian young man who looks to be about 18 with long hair, knows where he is going, is not bothering anyone and even has a map on him,somehow managed to communicate this to Berkeley PD in the same AFTERNOON and before dark that day brought him home to N. Berkeley just ""to protect and serve.""  This is total Hollyweird.  There is not a snowball's chance in hell of this actually happening in real life.Then we are asked to listen to ""dad"" reassure all the female characters that their ""feelings"" are ""valid."" Barf and more barf.  Who appointed Berkeley men the curators of Berkeley womens' feelings? Who decided THE MEN would validate the WOMEN's emotion? And why is it the men always nervously tell the women calm down, even when the women always appear to be calmer than the men? What real Berkeley woman would tolerate such condescension? Who raised these people?!I thought Jackie Gleason on The Honeymooners was more honest, actually.Why do all the women cry and why do all the scenes confuse yelling with ""communication?""  Why is it ""autistic"" to ask, ""does she get in trouble for yelling?"" (if I get in trouble for sneaking out).  Who decided that someone has to be blamed for everything that happens? Who decided that all teenagers must be ""controlled"" ""labeled"" and ""accounted for?""  Where did ALL this GUILT come from? And what does it have to do with real life? Why should ""Max"" care? Why shouldn't he be self-centered? He's a teenager!  Why is big sister blaming him for her choice, which has been wheel spinning, worrying, nail biting and whining, which has nothing to do with Max? And why is his behavior considered to be ""autistic?!"" makes perfect sense to me, he wants to go to the museum, he's expressed it verbally, he's been ignored, he's got a map, he's a teenager, so what harm is there in GOING? It's initative! He was not hurt.  Yes, he could have sent a text or left a voicemail, but then, sister should be punished for yelling, I say.  Since when is focus, single-mindedness, independent problem solving and initiative to be punished?  Are the parents not more ""emotionally disturbed"" than the teen, here?Do writers intend a twisted pun or is the whole premise...twisted? I thought not, when I lived in Berkeley, California, but five years after leaving, it seems pretty twisted...compared to anywhere else, USA. If you strongly identify with this script...MOVE!so...i'm sure the writer of this episode never met the writer of this review..ahem formerly of Berkeley, with a son named Dax...who is not autstic but...i've been accused of autism...why, oh why does it have to be a dis-ease, when ""Max"" functions more sanely,more adaptively, less intrusively than anyone else?!",1,"Abby's Movie Reviews:

The writers made some attempt to represent the diversity of life with story lines about homelessness, alcohol addiction, teenage sex, interracial heterosexual relationships, etc. But Season 3 just imploded into a traditional, right-wing ""stand by your man"" stance when Jasmine decides, for no apparent reason, to drop this gorgeous, successful, responsible doctor who loves her son, for Crosby, who has been unfaithful to her. Please. Don't we see enough bogus messages that men can screw around and women will be (should be?) tolerant and forgiving? The script is more a reflection of a male fantasy rather than a depiction of a decision made by a strong, independent woman like Jasmine. Then, rather than protect his niece and condemn dishonesty and deceit, Crosby blames Amber for sleeping with a musician who doesn't tell her he already has a girlfriend.

Yes, there are dysfunctions. Too many of the siblings depend on the oldest brother, Adam, to bail them out of their troubles, so much so that it affected his work in an earlier season.We see growth in their lives, even as we see events that we have all seen in our lives.

Meanwhile, their teenage daughter Haddie is getting more serious with her first real boyfriend, Alex - who is not of their race and never finished high school - while adolescent Max, who has Asperger's syndrome, is struggling to mainstream in a regular school.Unable to produce a biological sibling for their daughter Sydney, Julia and her husband Joel (Sam Jaeger) are looking into adoption, which becomes a much more difficult and stressful venture than either dreamed.Single mom Sarah is struggling to deal with daughter Amber's newfound independence after graduating high school. She also continues to date Mark Cyr (Jason Ritter), who is her son Drew's English teacher, making for much awkwardness.Finally, Crosby talks his brother Adam into starting a new business venture - something that, given his current life situation, Kristina is less than thrilled about. Also a single dad, Crosby works hard at keeping involved in his son Jabbar's life, even when his ex Jasmine has a new man who seems just about perfect.As always, there is never a dull moment among the Bravermans.

It makes no sense and, further, it is acted poorly, with little or no reactions from other family members and a saintly, self-satisfied look on the face of the older brother, who selflessly gives up the millions in favor of his baby brother's love and in aid of his dream -- even though older bro has three children, including a baby and whose wife has gotten a job when she should have been with her three-month old baby. (no one mentions the baby's needs, just that she has 'been put into day-care').Giving up the money for a seemingly spoiled younger son, who, in fact, doesn't put much work into getting clients, when older bro needs it desperately, makes no sense and is irritating.The role of Hattie is very limited this time and the actor sometimes seems to be relying on her own shtick. She knows how to be fresh and interesting but doesn't muster it much and her limited lines don't help her.My original comment, while I was waiting forever for it to arrive:It is unconscionable to hold dvds so long after tv presentation. One's enthusiasm turns from faded to outright antipathy.And charging approximately double a reasonable rate is simply arrogant and greedy. Some families and individuals may love some series, including Parenthood, but simply cannot afford to buy it any more.The value of a series' production is unrelated to the charge demanded for its dvds.

(Their relationship is boring and lacks chemistry.)  Sarah isn't even thinking about marriage, just a baby.

And she wouldn't ask her dad to take care of them while she flits away with this new guy...

1446043,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0058YPIF0,Z Hayes,"[4, 4]","I only started watching Parenthood because Lauren Graham, one of my favorite TV actors (from her days on Gilmore Girls) was in it. The show's storyline which is based on the Braverman family, explores the dynamics of being part of a large extended family, single parenting, teen angst, and marital difficulties. Also, this is one of the few shows on television that explores what it is like to have a special needs child. The storyline each week is interesting, keeps viewers engaged, and the acting by the ensemble cast has grown from strength to strength.Craig T. Nelson plays Zeke, the patriarch of the Braverman clan, who is married to sweet and gentle Camille (Bonnie Bedelia). The couple have four adult children - Adam (Peter Krause, one of my favorite actors in this show), Sarah (Lauren Graham), Erika Christensen (Julia), and Crosby (Dax Shepard). Adam is a senior executive at a shoe manufacturing company and is married to housewife Kristina (Monica Potter) and they have a teenage daughter and a young son. Sarah is the 'problem child' who married young, moved away, and then gets divorced and moves back into her parents' home with her two teenage children, Amber (Mae Whitman) and Drew. Sarah has her own set of problems - can't seem to find a job that really brings out her potential, isn't sure what exactly she's meant to do, and her teenage daughter Amber is quite a handful in this first season. Then there's high achiever Julia, who is a hot-shot attorney, married to a building contractor turned stay-at-home dad, Joel Graham (Sam Yaeger), and they have a precocious young daughter. Finally, the youngest in the family is carefree, wild child Crosby who matures through the series, from an irresponsible, anything goes guy to a caring, responsible father and hardworking entrepreneur.In the third season of Parenthood, Sarah turns 40, and when her romance with a much younger guy takes off, she begins to ask herself some serious questions. Things get a bit complicated when her ex, Seth turns up, in bad shape and desperately in need of help. In the meantime, Amber moves out on her own and tries to make her own living, but finds that living in the real world is not as easy as she had envisioned. Drew finds romance but his grades also begin to suffer.Adam and Kristina face many new challenges this season - their son Max is now attending a regular public school, but finds it difficult coping with the changes, and his social awkwardness affects his relationship with his peers; Haddie faces her own problems; and Adam and Kristina's marriage undergoes a rough patch.Julia and Joel sign on to adopt the baby of a  pregnant girl who sells coffee at Julia's office, but inevitably complications arise with heartbreaking results. And Crosby becomes seriously concerned when Jasmine's romance with Jabbar's pediatrician takes off and he feels threatened that Jabbar will transfer his affections over to the new guy.The stories play out well, and mostly don't come across as contrived. The ensemble cast does a wonderful job, especially Nelson, Bedelia, Krause, Graham, and Potter. It is such a refreshing change from all the trashy reality TV that passes off as TV programming these days.

I began watching Parenthood during season three, this is when the writing and acting comes together forming a style of TV that's heartwarming, heart wrenching, relative, contemporary, and engaging. This is the best show on TV in family sitcoms because of all the talent and the culmination of writing and acting. I have seen a few earlier episodes in which the show is getting on its feet and isn't set in its way. I wrote a similar review of Season Four which just came off the air. It's a great TV show in the family genre, and better than past shows like Everybody Loves Raymond. Characters are relate able and engaging. All aspects of TV are found on this show. If you've seen any of the promos on NBC or anywhere else definitely check it out.
