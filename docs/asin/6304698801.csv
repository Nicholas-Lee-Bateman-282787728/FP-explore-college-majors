The score alone is enought to make me gag; it could have been written for some cheesy made-for-TV movie or even one of the later Gunsmoke episodes.

You have one of Eastwood's stronger roles and a great supporting cast (everyone from Bruce Dern to Dennis Hopper is in this one). You also have a graphic and horrifying opening sequence. The story is Eastwood is mistaken for a rustler, mistakenly lynched. He survives, becomes a marshall and hunts down the men who did it, falling in love along the way. And underneath it all, there is the director's commentary on capital punishment. The film leaves a few loose ends, not enough for a sequal (if that is what he was thinking at the time), or really enough to make the viewer think. Instead, just enough questions to annoy the watcher. Still, it is one of Eastwood's best movies.As a dvd it falls way short.

Fairbanks""","[0, 0]","After earning major stardom with Sergio Leone's spaghetti western trilogy, Clint Eastwood turned down both Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and Carl Foreman's ""MacKenna's Gold"" to star in and co-produce this tightly scripted, well-acted western directed by ""Gunsmoke"" veteran Ted Post. It proved a good choice. If not a masterpiece on the order of Leone's film, or a star studded spectacular like Foreman's offering, ""Hang 'Em High"" was something the other two were not: a hit. It's also intelligent and makes some interesting if subtle comments on the meaning of justice. The clean-shaven Eastwood is fine as Jed Cooper, a former marshal who once more wears a badge to hunt down the men who hanged him as an alleged cattle thief, but Pat Hingle as a hanging judge who is even more vengeance minded than Eastwood offers the standout performance.

433740,A1Z3LU078VNOA6,6304698801,C. Wynes,"[6, 7]","A good western is about two themes: violence and justice.  ""Hang 'em High"", mostly overlooked beneath the shadow of Eastwood's work with Sergio Leone of the same period, is a surprisingly deep examination of these themes as they play out in pre-statehood Oklahoma.The film works through three different storylines, all of which come together to address the primary theme of the picture.The central storyline is a simple revenge tale.  Eastwood's character, former lawman Jed Cooper, is wrongfully hanged by a gang of nine vigilantes.  Saved from death by an honest marshall, Cooper becomes a lawman once again as deputy marshall in the Oklahoma Territory.  With the blessing of the territory's judge, he embarks on a mission to round up those who were responsible for his hanging.Along the way, he pursues and apprehends three cattle rustlers who had done murder.  Among them are two young men who claim they had nothing to do with the decision to murder the man, and the two cooperate with Cooper's effort to bring all three men to town to face justice.  The mob that helped him catch the men had wanted to hang them on the spot, but Cooper insisted that they be taken into custody and brought before a court of law.  Back in town, Cooper stands up for the two young men and doesn't want to see them hanged.  The judge sees things differently: the people demand justice as they see it, and the way they see it is through a hanging.  If the judge doesn't hang them all, then the people will take the law into their own hands, just as they did wrongfully try to hang Cooper himself.The third storyline is that of the pretty, young blond girl.  The jailors and lawmen are all under orders to let her examine every outlaw brought into town.  She later reveals that she's looking for two men in particular, two men who had done her a great wrong in the past.In large part, this is a film about the death penalty and the merits of the retributivist theory of justice.  If the girl were to find those two men, would their hanging do her any good?  What if she never found them?  Does Cooper need to find the men who've done him wrong?  What to do with those he does find?Whether men are hanged or spared their lives, there are consequences.  There are consequences both for individuals seeking justice, and for society as a whole.  There are consequences for those who perpetrate violence and those who are victimized by it.  ""Hang 'em High"" engages the viewer on these subjects, and in so doing exceeds the expectation that it is just another shoot-'em-up gunslinger picture.The musical score, an integral part of any good western, both hits and misses.  It hits with a great, memorable theme.  You probably have heard the theme even if you've never seen the film.  The score misses, however, by muddying up the theme with the full orchestration commonplace in MGM studio pictures of the time.  In many places, the score sounds like it was yanked directly out of ""Star Wars"", and the music produces a mood that doesn't fit with the film.Overall, this is a western that does all the typically western elements right.  It surpasses expectations by delivering on an engaging storyline about the ethics of justice.  ""Hang 'em High"" is an excellent film.  I'm compelled to drop it down to 4 stars, however, by the way that it stumbles about for the first 30 minutes or so trying to find its groove, and by the way the score seems misplaced in those early scenes.  It fully recovers and becomes a great western, but doesn't quite reach the heights of perfection reached by ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" or ""A Fistful of Dollars.""",4,"A smart, compelling western that exceeds expectations",1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,3621,"['good', 'western', 'two', 'themes', 'violence', 'justice', 'Hang', 'High', 'mostly', 'overlooked', 'shadow', 'Eastwood', 'work', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'same', 'period', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'examination', 'themes', 'play', 'out', 'pre-statehood', 'Oklahoma.The', 'film', 'works', 'three', 'different', 'storylines', 'come', 'together', 'address', 'primary', 'theme', 'picture.The', 'central', 'storyline', 'simple', 'revenge', 'tale', 'Eastwood', 'character', 'former', 'lawman', 'Jed', 'Cooper', 'wrongfully', 'hanged', 'gang', 'nine', 'vigilantes', 'Saved', 'death', 'honest', 'marshall', 'Cooper', 'lawman', 'once', 'again', 'deputy', 'marshall', 'Oklahoma', 'Territory', 'blessing', 'territory', 'judge', 'mission', 'round', 'up', 'who', 'were', 'responsible', 'hanging.Along', 'way', 'three', 'cattle', 'rustlers', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'murder', 'are', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'claim', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'decision', 'murder', 'man', 'two', 'cooperate', 'Cooper', 'effort', 'bring', 'three', 'men', 'town', 'face', 'justice', 'mob', 'helped', 'catch', 'men', 'had', 'wanted', 'hang', 'spot', 'Cooper', 'insisted', 'be', 'taken', 'custody', 'brought', 'court', 'law', 'Back', 'town', 'Cooper', 'up', 'two', 'young', 'men', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'hanged', 'judge', 'things', 'differently', 'people', 'demand', 'justice', 'see', 'way', 'see', 'hanging', 'judge', ""n't"", 'hang', 'then', 'people', 'will', 'take', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'just', 'did', 'wrongfully', 'try', 'hang', 'Cooper', 'himself.The', 'third', 'storyline', 'pretty', 'young', 'blond', 'girl', 'jailors', 'lawmen', 'are', 'orders', 'let', 'examine', 'outlaw', 'brought', 'town', 'later', 'reveals', 'looking', 'two', 'men', 'particular', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'great', 'wrong', 'past.In', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'death', 'penalty', 'merits', 'retributivist', 'theory', 'justice', 'girl', 'were', 'find', 'two', 'men', 'would', 'hanging', 'do', 'good', 'What', 'never', 'found', 'Does', 'Cooper', 'need', 'find', 'men', 'who', ""'ve"", 'done', 'wrong', 'What', 'do', 'find', 'Whether', 'men', 'are', 'hanged', 'spared', 'lives', 'are', 'consequences', 'are', 'consequences', 'individuals', 'seeking', 'justice', 'society', 'whole', 'are', 'consequences', 'who', 'perpetrate', 'violence', 'who', 'are', 'victimized', 'Hang', 'High', 'viewer', 'subjects', 'so', 'doing', 'expectation', 'just', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'gunslinger', 'picture.The', 'musical', 'score', 'integral', 'part', 'good', 'western', 'hits', 'misses', 'great', 'memorable', 'theme', 'probably', 'have', 'heard', 'theme', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'score', 'misses', 'however', 'muddying', 'up', 'theme', 'full', 'orchestration', 'commonplace', 'MGM', 'studio', 'pictures', 'time', 'many', 'places', 'score', 'was', 'yanked', 'directly', 'Star', 'Wars', 'music', 'mood', ""n't"", 'fit', 'film.Overall', 'western', 'typically', 'western', 'elements', 'right', 'expectations', 'delivering', 'engaging', 'storyline', 'ethics', 'justice', 'Hang', 'High', 'excellent', 'film', ""'m"", 'compelled', 'drop', 'down', '4', 'stars', 'however', 'way', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'trying', 'find', 'groove', 'way', 'score', 'misplaced', 'early', 'scenes', 'fully', 'recovers', 'great', 'western', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'heights', 'perfection', 'reached', 'Good', 'Bad', 'Ugly', 'Fistful', 'Dollars']",N/A
433741,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6304698801,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","A note of trivia:  Ed Begley Sr., Alan Hale Jr., Bruce Dern, father of Laura Dern, and James MacArthur, son of Helen Hayes are in the film's illustrious cast.  I don't believe this film got big play by the critics on initial release probably because they were late comers to the Sergio Leone trilogy.  Taken in context with the trajectory that Clint Eastwood's career has taken it's very consistent with themes explored in his latter works.  Here frontier justice, vigilanteism, and the death penalty are examined.  Eastwood plays an innocent rancher who is hung for murder by a bloodthirsty posse.  Rescued by the sheriff from certain death he is given a chance to avenge his hanging by a sympathetic judge by deputizing him and telling him to bring his tormentors in alive.  Eastwood's Jeb Cooper is not the shoot-and-ask-questions-later Man With No Name of the Leone films.  He has a certain ambivalence about his task at hand and he feels conflicted about what he has to do.

HANG 'EM HIGH launched Eastwood into iconic superstar status. (Though how this film could be that vehicle vexes me.) Moving forward, Eastwood would make a plethora of Hollywood films that set box office records, making HANG 'EM HIGH quite the metaphorical springboard. (Just try using ""metaphorical springboard"" in a review of a Western, I dare ya.) I could go on and on (but mercifully will not), but suffice it to say despite the positives this film did for Eastwood's career HANG 'EM HIGH is melodramatic, overdone sophistry. It's mediocrity run amuck.Does it have its moments? Of course. With star power like Eastwood, Pat Hingle, Ed Begley, Ben Johnson, Bruce Dern, and L.Q. Jones, this movie is bound to have its grand Western moments. Yet it also runs too long, Eastwood's character is up and down like a yo-yo, co-star Inger Stevens is more wooden than a department store mannequin, the subsequent hangings (there are alot of them, folks) are just silly, and poor Dennis Hopper makes a brief appearance that's a howler (quite the flopping death). Yes, it's a story of misguided justice, and vengeance--but it's also contrived, melodramatic, and takes forever to get to its (predictable) ending.Other than that, no problemo.What struck me is the subsequent tragedy of two actresses in two films Eastwood made at this time.

433751,A1L0HZI35HF8OF,6304698801,Eric V. Moye,"[18, 19]","Along with the Sergio Leone trilogy, this movie helped make the Clint Eastwood legend.  It is the simplest story line (after love) - revenge.  Eastwood is an everyman, just a rancher.  He buys some cattle from a passing drive, only to learn they are stolen.  The true owners come along, and hang him before the truth can be ascertained.  A passing lawman finds him swinging from a tree, saves his life and puts him in a jail wagon until his story can be figured out.  The rest of the movie is Eastwood's tracking down those bad guys (not  relevant is the fact that for the most part they are ""good and true citizens"") and bringing them to justice; either at the jailhouse or by his bullets.  And Eastwood revenge is something else - he even shoots the dog!Eastwood's character, Marshall Cooper is another strong and silent type, just like ""The Man With No Name"" whom we have come to expect in the Leone westerns.  Unlike the spaghetti westerns, though, this time while he is again basically a good guy, he is now on the establishment side.Eastwood is joined by a positively fabulous supporting cast:  Western veterans Ben Johnson and Ed Begley, Pat Hingle as a true hangin' judge, Dennis Hopper (who is such a  psycho even then, we are glad to see that he is the first guy killed in the film), Bruce Dern, L.Q. Jones.  Surprising appearances are entered by Gilligan's Skipper, Alan Hale and Steve McGarrett's Five-0 sidekick ""Dano"", James McArthur.  And for the true Star Trek cognoscenti, we have an appearance by Mark Leonard, who gave up his job as Oklahoma Territory Prosecuting Attorney to become Sarek, a/k/a Father of Spock.Unlike some other reviewers, I found the more polished (as opposed to the Leone western trilogy) soundtrack superior to the movies which had preceded it.  I also thought the cinematography supeerior here, with some breathtaking vistas.Lots of reviewers dog this one out for not being up to the standards of the Leone trilogy. However, I think it is their equal, because the characters have more depth.  Maybe I am just not the fan of minimalist genre of S. Leone.  Nonetheless, I particularly find the bad guys are more complex than any in the spaghetti westerns, and I find this more pleasing.It is one of my very favorite shoot-em-ups.

433752,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6304698801,Erik North,"[2, 3]","After a few years as Rowdy Yates in the TV series ""Rawhide"", Clint Eastwood managed to attain international superstardom via the trilogy of wacky, violent Italian spaghetti westerns he made with director Sergio Leone in the mid-1960s.  And then in 1968, he returned to America to make his own homegrown sagebrush impact.  The end result was HANG 'EM HIGH, a significant box office hit upon its release in the late summer of 1968.Here, Eastwood portrays a former lawman on a cattle drive through the barren Oklahoma Territory who is set upon by a gang of rustlers, led by Ed Begley, who proceed to string him up for getting those cattle from a ranching family they claim he had murdered.  But there are two problems with that: Eastwood wasn't the culprit in those murders; and when they string him up, they don't finish the job.  Saved from certain death by a local marshal (Ben Johnson, always that most credible of Western actors), he is then made a federal marshal by the territorial judge (Pat Hingle) and assigned the task of getting the rustlers who tried to kill him, but turning them in alive, so Hingle can try them and then hang 'em--and hang 'em high!Eastwood's thirst for vengeance does not make him a remorseless killing machine, however, since he comes to question Hingle's brand of ""justice"", and especially after having a fire lit under him by a woman (Inger Stevens) who also wants revenge for her ex-husband having been murdered, possibly by Begley's crew (including Bruce Dern and L.Q. Jones).  He happens to show a lot of mercy to an old man (Bob Steele) who had originally been part of Begley's lynching crew because Steele had warned Begley that they hung an innocent man.All of this makes HANG 'EM HIGH stand out.  More than a few critics groused upon its release that this movie was merely made to cash in on the Eastwood/Leone films, which racked up big box office in America in 1967.  But while there is some of Leone's influence here, HANG 'EM HIGH is not as wacky or violent as those films were.  It is a complex and quite thought-provoking meditation on the idea of frontier justice.  Contrary to the notion of Eastwood being every bit as staunch a Hollywood conservative as John Wayne, HANG 'EM HIGH shows us, as did Leone, and as Sam Peckinpah would, that the demarcation between good and evil, and right and wrong, is an often thin line that is often crossed.Ted Post, who had directed Eastwood in a few ""Rawhide"" episodes and made his feature-film directing debut here, sometimes slips in his overuse of the zoom lens and Leone-inspired closeups for certain shock effects (notably the hanging sequences, of which there are plenty, but none shown in ultra-graphic detail).  But he does give Eastwood a lot to work with, via the screenplay by producer Leonard Freeman (who later created ""Hawaii Five-O""), and Mel Goldberg.  Hingle makes for a very cagey judge; and Dern and Jones do the villain parts to a tee.  Also featured here are Alan Hale Jr. (much more menacing than his ""Skipper"" role in ""Gilligan's Island"" will have you believe), Charles McGraw, Arlene Golonka, and, in a brief but typically flamboyant bit part as a sagebrush religious psychotic, Dennis Hopper.Featuring a good score by Dominic Frontiere (whose main theme would be popularized by Booker T and the MGs later in '68), and shot on location in New Mexico, HANG 'EM HIGH is one of the most underrated films of the Western genre from the 1960s, and marked Eastwood as a very efficient ""star"", on the verge of becoming one heck of an actor and director to boot as well.",4,Never Hang The Wrong Man...Without Finishing The Job,1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,3570,"['few', 'years', 'Rowdy', 'TV', 'series', 'Rawhide', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'managed', 'attain', 'international', 'superstardom', 'trilogy', 'wacky', 'violent', 'Italian', 'spaghetti', 'westerns', 'made', 'director', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'mid-1960s', 'then', '1968', 'returned', 'America', 'make', 'own', 'homegrown', 'sagebrush', 'impact', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'HANG', ""'EM"", 'HIGH', 'significant', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'release', 'late', 'summer', '1968.Here', 'Eastwood', 'former', 'lawman', 'cattle', 'drive', 'barren', 'Oklahoma', 'Territory', 'who', 'set', 'gang', 'rustlers', 'led', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'who', 'proceed', 'string', 'up', 'getting', 'cattle', 'ranching', 'family', 'claim', 'had', 'murdered', 'are', 'two', 'problems', 'Eastwood', 'was', ""n't"", 'culprit', 'murders', 'when', 'string', 'up', 'do', ""n't"", 'finish', 'job', 'Saved', 'certain', 'death', 'local', 'marshal', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'always', 'most', 'credible', 'Western', 'actors', 'then', 'made', 'federal', 'marshal', 'territorial', 'judge', 'Pat', 'Hingle', 'assigned', 'task', 'getting', 'rustlers', 'who', 'tried', 'kill', 'turning', 'alive', 'Hingle', 'can', 'try', 'then', 'hang', 'hang', 'high', 'Eastwood', 'thirst', 'vengeance', 'not', 'make', 'remorseless', 'killing', 'machine', 'however', 'question', 'Hingle', 'brand', 'justice', 'especially', 'having', 'fire', 'lit', 'woman', 'Inger', 'Stevens', 'who', 'also', 'revenge', 'ex-husband', 'having', 'been', 'murdered', 'possibly', 'Begley', 'crew', 'including', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'show', 'lot', 'mercy', 'old', 'man', 'Bob', 'Steele', 'who', 'had', 'originally', 'been', 'part', 'Begley', 'lynching', 'crew', 'Steele', 'had', 'warned', 'Begley', 'hung', 'innocent', 'man.All', 'HANG', ""'EM"", 'HIGH', 'stand', 'out', 'More', 'few', 'critics', 'groused', 'release', 'movie', 'was', 'merely', 'made', 'cash', 'Eastwood/Leone', 'films', 'racked', 'up', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'America', '1967', 'Leone', 'influence', 'here', 'HANG', ""'EM"", 'HIGH', 'not', 'wacky', 'violent', 'films', 'were', 'complex', 'quite', 'thought-provoking', 'meditation', 'idea', 'frontier', 'justice', 'Contrary', 'notion', 'Eastwood', 'being', 'bit', 'staunch', 'Hollywood', 'conservative', 'John', 'Wayne', 'HANG', ""'EM"", 'HIGH', 'did', 'Leone', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'would', 'demarcation', 'good', 'evil', 'right', 'wrong', 'often', 'thin', 'line', 'often', 'crossed.Ted', 'Post', 'who', 'had', 'directed', 'Eastwood', 'few', 'Rawhide', 'episodes', 'made', 'feature-film', 'directing', 'debut', 'here', 'sometimes', 'overuse', 'zoom', 'Leone-inspired', 'closeups', 'certain', 'shock', 'effects', 'notably', 'hanging', 'sequences', 'are', 'plenty', 'none', 'shown', 'ultra-graphic', 'detail', 'give', 'Eastwood', 'lot', 'work', 'screenplay', 'producer', 'Leonard', 'Freeman', 'who', 'later', 'created', 'Hawaii', 'Five-O', 'Mel', 'Goldberg', 'Hingle', 'very', 'cagey', 'judge', 'Dern', 'Jones', 'do', 'villain', 'parts', 'tee', 'Also', 'featured', 'here', 'are', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Jr.', 'much', 'more', 'menacing', 'Skipper', 'role', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'will', 'have', 'believe', 'Charles', 'McGraw', 'Arlene', 'Golonka', 'brief', 'typically', 'flamboyant', 'bit', 'part', 'sagebrush', 'religious', 'psychotic', 'Dennis', 'Hopper.Featuring', 'good', 'score', 'Dominic', 'Frontiere', 'main', 'theme', 'would', 'be', 'popularized', 'Booker', 'T', 'MGs', 'later', ""'68"", 'shot', 'location', 'New', 'Mexico', 'HANG', ""'EM"", 'HIGH', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'films', 'Western', 'genre', '1960s', 'marked', 'Eastwood', 'very', 'efficient', 'star', 'verge', 'becoming', 'one', 'heck', 'actor', 'director', 'boot', 'as', 'well']",N/A

It followed up his three, ""Spaghetti Westerns,"" made with Sergio Leone, and the style of those films is adapted somewhat to the more traditional Hollywood Western style.  You could call this one a bit of a hybrid between those two styles.The script is excellent, the cast is fantastic, and the direction is solid.  This is a great Western.The Blu Ray is very good.  The DVD was a bit disappointing with colors that smeared a little, lots of print damage and dust, and a picture that wasn't very crisp and clear.  The Blu Ray, on the other hand, has very little of that print damage remaining.  The colors are sharp and don't bleed.  The picture is significantly crisper and cleaner.  The improvement is easily noticeable when compared back to back.If you like Clint Eastwood or Westerns (and especially if you like both), then this movie is highly recommended.

There were the white hats and the black hats and the white hats always prevailed. I must have watched hundreds of them during my youth in the late 40s and early 50s. Then westerns got much more serious and gradually faded out until nowadays you hardly ever seem to see one. Alas, I rather enjoyed western movies, especially some of the more serious ones of the 60s and 70s. Well, many are still available on DVD and I bought up a batch featuring Clint Eastwood. I'd previously seen a few of his movies and enjoyed them.Last night my wife and I watched ""Hang 'em High."" The movie was true to it's title. I've never seen so many hangings in one movie! Multiple hangings were a regular small-town public spectacle attended by festive audiences of hundreds of people. Even teenagers (16 and 18, in one instance) were hanged! And for what? Well murder could get you hanged, that was for certain.  Even stealing horses or cattle could also turn the trick. And if you didn't get hanged by the law, then bands of concerned self-appointed lawmen might do the job without such formalities as a trial. Such was the case in the wild-west Oklahoma Territory in the mid-1800s and Clint Eastwood was hanged for stealing cattle he had actually paid for. Fortunately, the Hangers botched the job and he was cut loose, cleared of the charges and turned into a deputy who's main task was to track down those nine men who had attempted to hang him. Of course, he gets the job done, Clint Eastwood style.""Hang 'em High"" is a very good movie, if you can stand all the hangings and other assorted violence. Well, it's fiction, isn't it? In any case, we enjoyed watching the movie. It was well done, if not somewhat excessively violent, entertainment.

When it was released HANG `EM HIGH was touted as an American version of the Spaghetti Western. That's interesting since the Spaghetti Western genre was Europe's version of America's Western genre. In this film the viewer gets interpretations of both genres. In fact the film actually looks more inspired by Hollywood Westerns of the 40s with doses of the 60s Spaghetti's influence interspersed throughout. The single constant Spaghetti influence was Dominic Frontiere's score which featured a catchy theme that carried the familiar rhythm and drive created by Ennio Morricone for A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE to mention a few. The excellent cast, which supported Clint Eastwood, included Pat Hingle, Ben Johnson, Dennis Hopper, L.Q. Jones, Bruce Dern, Ed Begley, Charles McGraw and Inger Stevens. Many of these actors just added to the fact that this was an American Western all the way and a good one at that. HANG `EM HIGH does not have the flash and stylized violence of the Spaghetti Western. Instead we get a deliberately paced film about revenge and the dichotomy of the meaning of law and order and real justice.

This was a regrettable mistake as it is a great western.  Hang `em High is Clint Eastwood's first American ""spaghetti"" western and undoubtedly the one that furthered his launch into mega stardom.  Upon excitedly opening the DVD case and placing the DVD into the player, one discovers that the only special feature is a theatrical trailer.  This is fine, as one doesn't truly purchase these DVD's for special features as much as they do for the movie.  While watching the theatrical trailer, I got the impression that this movie seemed as though it might lack the ""true grit"" style of his previous spaghetti westerns; this impression couldn't have been farther off though.  Hang `em High has a truly well written script and is played perfectly by all involved.The premise:Clint Eastwood plays Jed Cooper, a former law man from St. Louis, MO.  As the movie begins, we see him herding cattle past a river and he's approached by nine riders.  We soon learn that Jed thought he'd purchased these cattle honestly, but the person he bought them from was a criminal and now Jed's going to pay for it because these nine riders are a lynch mob and they intend to hang Jed.Fortunately for Jed, a law man comes by and cuts him down from the tree before he dies and throws him in the wagon with a bunch of other criminals headed towards the only court in the Oklahoma territory and run by the ""Hanging Judge.""  As luck would have it though, his story checks out and the judge offers him a job as a Federal Marshal.  What follows is a great western filled with Clint Eastwood's ""true grit"" western hero style as he sets out for vengeance upon those who attempted but failed to hang him.I would highly recommend this outstanding western for those who favor this genre heavily or casually and especially for those who are Eastwood fans!  {ssintrepid}",5,Hang 'em High - Eastwood's excellent first American western!,1049500800,"04 5, 2003",2003,1911,"['Surprisingly', 'enough', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'masterpiece', 'before', 'was', 'regrettable', 'mistake', 'great', 'western', 'Hang', 'em', 'High', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'first', 'American', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'furthered', 'launch', 'mega', 'stardom', 'excitedly', 'opening', 'DVD', 'case', 'placing', 'DVD', 'player', 'one', 'discovers', 'only', 'special', 'feature', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'fine', 'one', ""n't"", 'truly', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'movie', 'watching', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'got', 'impression', 'movie', 'seemed', 'might', 'lack', 'true', 'grit', 'style', 'previous', 'spaghetti', 'impression', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'farther', 'Hang', 'em', 'High', 'truly', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'played', 'perfectly', 'involved.The', 'premise', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Jed', 'Cooper', 'former', 'law', 'man', 'St.', 'Louis', 'MO', 'movie', 'see', 'herding', 'cattle', 'river', 'approached', 'nine', 'riders', 'soon', 'learn', 'Jed', 'thought', ""'d"", 'purchased', 'cattle', 'honestly', 'person', 'bought', 'was', 'criminal', 'now', 'Jed', 'going', 'pay', 'nine', 'riders', 'are', 'lynch', 'mob', 'intend', 'hang', 'Jed.Fortunately', 'Jed', 'law', 'man', 'cuts', 'down', 'tree', 'wagon', 'bunch', 'other', 'criminals', 'headed', 'only', 'court', 'Oklahoma', 'territory', 'run', 'Hanging', 'Judge', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'story', 'checks', 'out', 'judge', 'job', 'Federal', 'Marshal', 'What', 'great', 'western', 'filled', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'true', 'grit', 'western', 'hero', 'style', 'out', 'vengeance', 'who', 'attempted', 'failed', 'hang', 'him.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'outstanding', 'western', 'who', 'favor', 'genre', 'heavily', 'casually', 'especially', 'who', 'are', 'Eastwood', 'fans', 'ssintrepid']",N/A

The men ask Jed where he got the cattle.  In spite of Jed's law enforcement background and a signed bill of sale, the men think that Jed killed the owner of the cattle and stole them.  The men hang Jed.  Unfortunately for the men who hung Jed, they did a poor job.After another lawman rescues him, Jed becomes a federal marshal working for Judge Adam Fenton (Pat Hingle).  Much of the interaction between Judge Fenton and Marshal Cooper involves Coopers killing of many of the men he encounters (which tends to be a theme in Clint Eastwood movies anyway).  Marshal Cooper is relentless in the search for bad guys, most especially the lynch mob that did a bad job of hanging him.  Unfortunately, sometimes these men do not want to go with him and he has to give them a little Jed Cooper justice on the spot.During the course of this movie we meet a host of names that were famous in the 50s and 60s, and a couple that became more famous after the movie.  Inger Stevens plays the enigmatic and beautiful Rachel Warren.  Ed Begley (father of Ed Begley, Jr. and a veteran actor of film and television) plays Captain Wilson, the head of the lynch mob.  Ben Johnson plays Marshal Dave Bliss, who is the man who rescues Jed Cooper.  Bruce Dern and Alan Hale, both veterans of westerns, are also part of the hanging party.  Dennis Hopper and James McArthur also have relatively minor parts in this 1968 film.This film was an excellent film for Clint Eastwood.  He appeared in three 1968 films, the other two being ""Coogan's Bluff"" and ""Where Eagles Dare.""  ""Where Eagles Dare"" is a better movie, but Eastwood's acting in that movie was relatively limited.  Eastwood's role in ""Coogan's Bluff"" was somewhat stereotypical and not one of Eastwood's better films.  However, ""Hang `Em High"" is already a classic western and one of the best of Eastwood's early U.S. films in that it allowed Eastwood to demonstrate that he could act.

The film follows Eastwood's character who was wrongly accused of being a cattle rustler and lynched by mob of thugs.  Out for revenge, Eastwood nevertheless wants to do it by the law and is deputized as a marshall by a judge who needs new necks to hang from his gallows to give his town the semblance of order.  Accepting the assignment, Eastwood's character tracks down his past attackers one by one.  Eastwood's character also seeks the affections of a woman who seeks revenge against those who raped her and murdered her husband.This is a good western in which the characters and their motivations are well developed.  As one reviewer mentioned, this film explores the concepts of personal vs. collective retribution against past wrongs and the personal conflicts they entail.  The story explores the notions of what is crime and what is proper punishment.  It explores how barbarism and lawlessness are treated where legal instututions are lacking and span as far as the boundaries of a small frontier town.  It looks at how rampant crime and the absence of law generate both a sense of injustice and an overzealous desire for retribution.  The film also explores the consequences of crimes committed by groups in which the perpetrators differ by intent and degree in their participation.  Who is really more to blame?  The only down side to this film is that the ending is somewhat abrupt and rather empty in light of the climax of the story.

Vengence and retribution get pushed aside for a smoochie country picnic and some needless love interest. Somebody must have thought Clint needed a girl friend after finishing up the Leone trilogy. Wish L.Q. would have returned to finish up his earlier botched assassination attempt during this picnic sequence. Besides, this romantic interlude brought the film to a deadly halt with an impact equal of Reno getting blasted in the saloon, though not nearly as rewarding or as satisfying.Now I've got nothing against women (in general) in Westerns. Women often add much to the overall story, like splashing around in a wine vat in THE WILD BUNCH. But Inger's scenes here are a complete waste. I repeat, this would have been a far better Western had they cut her obligatory love-interest role and spent the time far more wisely by having Clint track down the last two guys instead. Whether he brought them back dead or alive, no matter. It certainly would have made more interesting viewing.Excellent dvd, looks and sounds just great. Lots of familiar faces too; Ben Johnson, L.Q.

The filmic aspects are fairly typical but the play of characters and their backdrop are satisfying and well done. Clint is less squinty and terse here than he is in the spaghetti westerns too.

433800,AK61LQI92GTCH,6304698801,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[1, 3]","An innocent cowboy is quickly tried and summarily lynched when a cattle baron and his cohorts find him in possession of stolen cattle.All this happens before the opening title begins to roll, and since the innocent getting strung up is Clint Eastwood you know it'll either be a botched hanging or we're in store for a weird flashback, a la Ambrose Bierce's `An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.'  The lynch mob is led by Ed Begley, and contains a number of familiar faces, including Alan Hale, Jr. and Bruce Dern.  Clint's dangle is abruptly terminated when passing US Marshal Ben Johnson cuts him down and dumps him into what looks like a prairie paddy wagon.  The wagon is traveling to the town that houses the only law for 20,000 square miles - or something like that.  Judge Pat Hingle awaits, and he goes on a bit about the vast area, the limited resources, and the need to establish law and civilize the land.  What the judge needs is a marshal who can help him pave the way for civilized society.It seems that in the best of Eastwood's movies he dies, or has a near death experience, and is reborn as a sneering agent of vengeance.  Reborn or merely indestructible, it's a neat way to build an icon and, somehow, allows the movie to ask big questions.  The big one in this, of course, is how far do we travel in our pursuit of justice?  Is personal vengeance more important that societal justice?The five stars I gave HANG `EM HIGH should be taken with a grain of salt and a caveat of emptor.  I don't think it's a very good movie.  Inger Stevens plays a widow lady who's on her own journey of retribution and, as usual with her back then, is under-used.  Director Ted Post spent most of his career directing television programs, including episodes of the Eastwood-starring ""Rawhide,"" and the movie has a pretty lumpy pace.  The lumpiest scene occurs near the end of the movie, that time most plots would (and should) be racing to the finish line.  That last act contains an unforgivably long scene with James ""Book'em, Dan-O"" MacArthur as a preacher saying service over a number of condemned men on the scaffold.  If there was a point to that scene it was lost on me - didn't advance the plot, didn't flesh out any of the characters I was interested in.The movie has too many head-scratching, `what-were-they-thinking-of,' scenes like that to serious consider it a classic.  I threw my five stars at it becomes it gave us Clint as a practically pure vessel of retribution.  He doesn't get cute in the role, or often lose that snarl and squint, but it's a pleasure to see him track `em down and - to please the judge - bring them back alive (whenever possible.)  Keep your eyes open for a young Dennis Hopper playing a deranged character named The Preacher.  I knew he was in the movie but didn't recognize him.  He appears early on and Marshal Ben Johnson is the one trying to chain him up and bring him in.If you're not a fan of Eastwood's western this one may not appeal to you.  There's a lot in it that doesn't much appeal to me, but the spine of the story - Eastwood's quest for revenge - was strong enough for me to overlook its weaker elements.",5,Quintessential Clint,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,3157,"['innocent', 'cowboy', 'quickly', 'tried', 'summarily', 'lynched', 'when', 'cattle', 'baron', 'cohorts', 'find', 'possession', 'stolen', 'cattle.All', 'opening', 'title', 'roll', 'innocent', 'getting', 'strung', 'up', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'know', ""'ll"", 'either', 'be', 'botched', 'hanging', ""'re"", 'store', 'weird', 'flashback', 'la', 'Ambrose', 'Bierce', 'Occurrence', 'Owl', 'Creek', 'Bridge', 'lynch', 'mob', 'led', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'number', 'familiar', 'including', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Jr.', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Clint', 'dangle', 'abruptly', 'terminated', 'when', 'passing', 'US', 'Marshal', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'down', 'dumps', 'what', 'prairie', 'paddy', 'wagon', 'wagon', 'traveling', 'town', 'houses', 'only', 'law', '20,000', 'square', 'miles', 'something', 'Judge', 'Pat', 'Hingle', 'awaits', 'bit', 'vast', 'area', 'limited', 'resources', 'need', 'establish', 'law', 'civilize', 'land', 'What', 'judge', 'marshal', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'pave', 'way', 'civilized', 'society.It', 'best', 'Eastwood', 'movies', 'near', 'death', 'experience', 'reborn', 'sneering', 'agent', 'vengeance', 'Reborn', 'merely', 'indestructible', 'neat', 'way', 'build', 'icon', 'somehow', 'movie', 'ask', 'big', 'questions', 'big', 'one', 'course', 'how', 'far', 'do', 'travel', 'pursuit', 'justice', 'personal', 'vengeance', 'more', 'important', 'societal', 'justice', 'five', 'stars', 'gave', 'HANG', 'EM', 'HIGH', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt', 'caveat', 'emptor', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Inger', 'Stevens', 'widow', 'lady', 'who', 'own', 'journey', 'retribution', 'usual', 'back', 'then', 'under-used', 'Director', 'Ted', 'Post', 'spent', 'most', 'career', 'directing', 'television', 'programs', 'including', 'episodes', 'Eastwood-starring', 'Rawhide', 'movie', 'pretty', 'lumpy', 'pace', 'lumpiest', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'time', 'most', 'plots', 'would', 'should', 'be', 'racing', 'finish', 'line', 'last', 'act', 'unforgivably', 'long', 'scene', 'James', ""Book'em"", 'Dan-O', 'MacArthur', 'preacher', 'saying', 'service', 'number', 'condemned', 'men', 'scaffold', 'was', 'point', 'scene', 'was', 'lost', 'did', ""n't"", 'advance', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'was', 'interested', 'in.The', 'movie', 'too', 'many', 'head-scratching', 'what-were-they-thinking-of', 'scenes', 'serious', 'consider', 'classic', 'threw', 'five', 'stars', 'gave', 'Clint', 'practically', 'pure', 'vessel', 'retribution', ""n't"", 'get', 'cute', 'role', 'often', 'lose', 'snarl', 'squint', 'pleasure', 'see', 'track', 'em', 'down', 'please', 'judge', 'bring', 'back', 'alive', 'whenever', 'possible', 'Keep', 'eyes', 'open', 'young', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'playing', 'deranged', 'character', 'named', 'Preacher', 'knew', 'was', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'early', 'Marshal', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'one', 'trying', 'chain', 'up', 'bring', 'in.If', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'Eastwood', 'western', 'one', 'may', 'not', 'appeal', 'lot', ""n't"", 'much', 'appeal', 'spine', 'story', 'Eastwood', 'quest', 'revenge', 'was', 'strong', 'enough', 'overlook', 'weaker', 'elements']",N/A

433802,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6304698801,T O'Brien,"[0, 0]","Following the huge success of Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy, Clint Eastwood returned to the States  and made a western that is almost an American spaghetti western.  Jed Cooper is driving his newly bought cattle herd home when a nine-man posse stops him, saying he stole the cattle and killed the owner.  Without a second thought, they string Cooper up on a nearby tree without making sure he's actually dead. A marshal happens to be riding by and cuts him down.  After the truth is discovered, Cooper is let free where he takes a job as a marshal and starts to hunt the men down responsible for the failed lynching.  The plot is pretty then as Cooper also deals with other crooks, not to mention some confrontations with a power hungry judge.  There's some good action throughout, and the style in general is similar to Leone's westerns. Because of the similarities, Hang 'Em High doesn't quite live up to expectations, but it's still worth a watch for western fans.In a role similar to the Man with No Name, Eastwood is Jed Cooper, a man with a taste for revenge after he's wrongfully accused of cattle rustling and murder, then left to hang.  Eastwood at his best here, a man on a mission who will stop at nothing to get the job done. Inger Stevens is the love interest, Rachel Warren, a woman searching for her husband's killers who raped her. Ed Begley plays Captain Wilson, the leader of the posse who hangs Cooper, but upon realizing he's still alive much later becomes terrified of being hunted down.  Pat Hingle is a good counterpart to Eastwood as Judge Fenton, a power-hungry judge trying to bring frontier justice to the Oklahoma territory.  Ben Johnson and Charles McGraw also make memorable appearances as two sheriffs Cooper encounters.  The posse includes Bruce Dern, Alan Hale JR, L.Q. Jones, Joe Sirola, and Bob Steele.  As good a cast as the movie boasts, there are so many good characters that many aren't dealt with or developed enough.The DVD is a good buy at just under $10.  The widescreen presentation is a little grainy but very watchable.  A trailer is included, but don't watch it before seeing the movie, it gives away a lot about what's to come.  All in all, not a great western, but worth a watch to see Eastwood in his first major American western.",3,Eastwood's 1st American western following the Dollars trilogy,1233100800,"01 28, 2009",2009,2281,"['Following', 'huge', 'success', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'Dollars', 'trilogy', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'returned', 'States', 'made', 'western', 'almost', 'American', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'Jed', 'Cooper', 'driving', 'newly', 'bought', 'cattle', 'herd', 'home', 'when', 'nine-man', 'posse', 'saying', 'stole', 'cattle', 'killed', 'owner', 'second', 'thought', 'string', 'Cooper', 'up', 'nearby', 'tree', 'making', 'sure', 'actually', 'dead', 'marshal', 'be', 'riding', 'cuts', 'down', 'truth', 'discovered', 'Cooper', 'let', 'free', 'where', 'job', 'marshal', 'hunt', 'men', 'down', 'responsible', 'failed', 'lynching', 'plot', 'pretty', 'then', 'Cooper', 'also', 'other', 'crooks', 'not', 'mention', 'confrontations', 'power', 'hungry', 'judge', 'good', 'action', 'style', 'general', 'similar', 'Leone', 'westerns', 'similarities', 'Hang', 'High', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'still', 'worth', 'watch', 'western', 'fans.In', 'role', 'similar', 'Man', 'No', 'Name', 'Eastwood', 'Jed', 'Cooper', 'man', 'taste', 'revenge', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'cattle', 'rustling', 'murder', 'then', 'left', 'hang', 'Eastwood', 'best', 'here', 'man', 'mission', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Inger', 'Stevens', 'love', 'interest', 'Rachel', 'Warren', 'woman', 'searching', 'husband', 'killers', 'who', 'raped', 'Ed', 'Begley', 'Captain', 'Wilson', 'leader', 'posse', 'who', 'Cooper', 'realizing', 'still', 'alive', 'much', 'later', 'becomes', 'terrified', 'being', 'hunted', 'down', 'Pat', 'Hingle', 'good', 'counterpart', 'Eastwood', 'Judge', 'Fenton', 'power-hungry', 'judge', 'trying', 'bring', 'frontier', 'justice', 'Oklahoma', 'territory', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'Charles', 'McGraw', 'also', 'make', 'memorable', 'appearances', 'two', 'sheriffs', 'Cooper', 'encounters', 'posse', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'JR', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'Joe', 'Sirola', 'Bob', 'Steele', 'good', 'cast', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'characters', 'many', 'are', ""n't"", 'dealt', 'developed', 'enough.The', 'DVD', 'good', 'buy', 'just', '10', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'little', 'grainy', 'very', 'watchable', 'trailer', 'included', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'seeing', 'movie', 'away', 'lot', 'what', 'come', 'not', 'great', 'western', 'watch', 'see', 'Eastwood', 'first', 'major', 'American', 'western']",N/A
