1259690,A1TT5T47AVDDBM,B002BFCMNA,Mcgivern Owen L,"[3, 3]","""Sunrise at Campobello"" is a first rate historical movie.  As it opens President Franklin Delano Roosevelt is stricken with polio in his early forties.  The early scenes are at FDR's summer retreat on Campobello Island in the Canadian province of New Brunswick.We watch as FDR courageously learns to walk with heavy braces and painfully adapts to crutches.  The climax is his historic nominating speech for NY Governor Alfred E. Smith at the 1924 Democratic Convention.SC features powerful performances by Ralph Bellamy as FDR, Jean Hagen as his assistant, Missy Le Hand, and Hume Cronyn as his right hand man, Louis Howe.  Special mention must go to Greer Garson, playing Eleanor Roosevelt, while getting that accent just right.  This viewer was initially surprised that this is not the young and beautiful Garson from such films as ""Random Harvest"". How the time flies.This reviewer had no problems with the 143 minute run time.  SC moves quickly. There were no apparent trace of the stage origins of the story and the transfer from VHS was very clean. The staging is a marvel. In brief, SC leaves nothing to carp at.

I finally realized, this is a really well written play/ script. The cast is also strong, with Ralph Bellamy really shining through in spite of seeming corny and over-pampered for a long stretch in the beginning. The sets and costumes are good also, though I don't think they got the early 20's right, looked more like the teens at the start, with a hint of the 60's seeping in later on. The production values are mixed, good in Hyde Park rooms and some outdoor scenes, 60's tv-like in other scenes. But that script! It's literate as can be, probably the best political drama ever written. Hume Cronyn is great.

1259692,A16QODENBJVUI1,B002BFCMNA,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","Shortly after finishing school and embarking on his career as an attorney, FDR told his fellow young lawyers of his career plan, which bore an eerie resemblance to the way his cousin Teddy's path to the White House. Things had been progressing remarkably on schedule, including becoming Assistant Secretary of the Navy, when he was struck down by polio. A remarkable athlete, FDR would never walk again, at that time the certain death of any political career. But while FDR might still have been at least a good president, he almost certainly would not have become a great one. In overcoming the enormous blow that life dealt him, Franklin underwent hardships previously inexperienced, instilling in him a depth of character previously lacking. And indirectly the polio led to his developing the capacity of compassion and sympathy for common people, for it was only during his extensive drives in the area around Warm Springs, Georgia, where he went frequently to bath in the springs, which he felt helped rehabilitate his legs, that he came to know everyday people. Driving about in his specially refitted car, with hand operated controls, he would stop and talk with farmers and others he could talk to from his vehicle. He learned about their travails, their concerns, and sufferings. None of this appears in the movie, which was based on a successful stage play, which could not easily have accommodated many of the key moments of these lost years in FDR's career.The film is not without significant shortcomings. It is too stagey, very clearly one scene from the stage transposed to the screen. And the film suffers historically both for what it leaves out and what it misrepresents. There are a myriad of amazing moments in these years, nearly all of which failed to make it into either the play or film. The most glaring inaccuracy, however, is one that even the finest historians of the 1940s and 1950s were unaware, and that is the fact the Roosevelt marriage existed in name only. For most purposes their marriage had ended with Eleanor's discovery of Franklin's infidelity with her social secretary Lucy Mercer. It certainly was lacking in the emotional closeness that is seen in the movie. In fairness to the film, the historical record in the late 1950s contained no mention of Franklin and Lucy's affair. James MacGregor Burns would make no mention of Lucy in Volume One of his masterful biography, published in 1956, and only passing reference in the second volume, published in 1970.  masterful biography of FDR. It was only in the 1960s and 1970s that knowledge of the affair became widespread.Nonetheless, I give this four stars. Why? Despite some inaccuracies, the film overall does a good job of representing the major events of the period of time after his being stricken with polio but before being elected governor of New York. And there are some remarkable performances, such as Greer Garson as Eleanor. A friend told me that they thought her too attractive to play Eleanor, but everyone who knew Eleanor talked of her beautiful hair and skin. Hume Cronin does an outstanding job as &#34;the little gnome&#34; Louis Howe. But the film is dominated by Ralph Bellamy, who is convincing as FDR despite not sounding or looking like him. The film is enhanced by on location filming.So despite the film's flaws, this is a thoroughly enjoyable film for both the student of FDR or those who simply like to see a nice movei.",4,A Stagey but nonetheless excellent film on FDR's lost years,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,3440,"['Shortly', 'finishing', 'school', 'embarking', 'career', 'attorney', 'FDR', 'told', 'fellow', 'young', 'lawyers', 'career', 'plan', 'bore', 'eerie', 'resemblance', 'way', 'cousin', 'Teddy', 'path', 'White', 'House', 'Things', 'had', 'been', 'progressing', 'remarkably', 'schedule', 'including', 'becoming', 'Assistant', 'Secretary', 'Navy', 'when', 'was', 'struck', 'down', 'polio', 'remarkable', 'athlete', 'FDR', 'would', 'never', 'walk', 'again', 'time', 'certain', 'death', 'political', 'career', 'FDR', 'might', 'still', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'good', 'president', 'almost', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'become', 'great', 'one', 'overcoming', 'enormous', 'blow', 'life', 'dealt', 'Franklin', 'underwent', 'hardships', 'previously', 'inexperienced', 'instilling', 'depth', 'character', 'previously', 'lacking', 'indirectly', 'polio', 'led', 'developing', 'capacity', 'compassion', 'sympathy', 'common', 'people', 'was', 'only', 'extensive', 'drives', 'area', 'Warm', 'Springs', 'Georgia', 'where', 'went', 'frequently', 'bath', 'springs', 'felt', 'helped', 'rehabilitate', 'legs', 'came', 'know', 'everyday', 'people', 'Driving', 'specially', 'refitted', 'car', 'hand', 'operated', 'controls', 'would', 'stop', 'talk', 'farmers', 'others', 'could', 'talk', 'vehicle', 'learned', 'travails', 'concerns', 'sufferings', 'None', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'successful', 'stage', 'play', 'could', 'not', 'easily', 'have', 'accommodated', 'many', 'key', 'moments', 'lost', 'years', 'FDR', 'career.The', 'film', 'not', 'significant', 'shortcomings', 'too', 'stagey', 'very', 'clearly', 'one', 'scene', 'stage', 'transposed', 'screen', 'film', 'suffers', 'historically', 'what', 'out', 'what', 'are', 'myriad', 'amazing', 'moments', 'years', 'nearly', 'failed', 'make', 'play', 'film', 'most', 'glaring', 'inaccuracy', 'however', 'one', 'even', 'finest', 'historians', '1940s', '1950s', 'were', 'unaware', 'fact', 'Roosevelt', 'marriage', 'existed', 'name', 'only', 'most', 'purposes', 'marriage', 'had', 'ended', 'Eleanor', 'discovery', 'Franklin', 'infidelity', 'social', 'secretary', 'Lucy', 'Mercer', 'certainly', 'was', 'lacking', 'emotional', 'closeness', 'seen', 'movie', 'fairness', 'film', 'historical', 'record', 'late', '1950s', 'contained', 'mention', 'Franklin', 'Lucy', 'affair', 'James', 'MacGregor', 'Burns', 'would', 'make', 'mention', 'Lucy', 'Volume', 'One', 'masterful', 'biography', 'published', '1956', 'only', 'passing', 'reference', 'second', 'volume', 'published', '1970.', 'masterful', 'biography', 'FDR', 'was', 'only', '1960s', '1970s', 'knowledge', 'affair', 'became', 'widespread.Nonetheless', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'Why', 'inaccuracies', 'film', 'overall', 'good', 'job', 'representing', 'major', 'events', 'period', 'time', 'being', 'stricken', 'polio', 'being', 'elected', 'governor', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'such', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Eleanor', 'A', 'friend', 'told', 'thought', 'too', 'attractive', 'play', 'Eleanor', 'everyone', 'who', 'knew', 'Eleanor', 'talked', 'beautiful', 'hair', 'skin', 'Hume', 'Cronin', 'outstanding', 'job', '34', 'little', 'gnome', '34', 'Louis', 'Howe', 'film', 'dominated', 'Ralph', 'Bellamy', 'who', 'convincing', 'FDR', 'not', 'sounding', 'looking', 'film', 'enhanced', 'location', 'filming.So', 'film', 'flaws', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'student', 'FDR', 'who', 'simply', 'see', 'nice', 'movei']",N/A
