1167867,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B001AR0D5Y,Carl Manes,"[1, 1]","In the land of direct-to-video Horror, few werewolf films manage to survive past their initial release. BLOOD MOON and GINGER SNAPS are two rare exceptions, and while NEVER CRY WEREWOLF does not quite stack up to these modern classics, its adaptation of the voyeuristic themes first presented in REAR WINDOW into an ""after-school special"" creature feature make for an enjoyable watch. The plot is simple enough, with two high school students trailing their creepy neighbor after they become suspicious of his lunar activities. Though its premise is clearly derivative, FRIGHT NIGHT and DISTURBIA fans can surely appreciate the familiar structure and expected scares, while werewolf fans will be pleasantly surprised by its impressive costume designs. NEVER CRY WEREWOLF overcomes its budgetary limitations in its brief use of computerized imagery by introducing a sleek weredog design that is far more creative and cleanly rendered than any of the other films sharing its size and scale. Outside of a cheesy cameo by Hercules' Kevin Sorbo, the acting here is also much better than one might expect.

1167873,ATZ1LTONGHOP6,B001AR0D5Y,Genevieve Hayes,"[21, 22]","Imagine ""Rear Window"" and ""Fright Night"" rolled into one movie and you've got a pretty good idea of what ""Never Cry Werewolf"" is about. Teenaged Loren (Nina Dobrev) thinks there's something odd about her new neighbour, Jared (Peter Stebbings), so starts spying on him from her bedroom window using her brother's telescope. It turns out that Jared is a werewolf and a serial killer, although the police won't believe Loren when she tries to tell them. This leaves Loren to deal with Jared herself, which she does with the assistance of Redd Tucker (Kevin Sorbo), a washed-up television hunter.""Never Cry Werewolf"" is an entertaining film and for a made-for-TV movie, it is above average in quality. However, there is something about this film that just didn't sit right in my mind. Although all of the scenes appear in a logical sequence and form a coherent story, there is something disjoint about them, to the point of being almost episodic, and the director never seems to quite make up his mind as to whether this is a horror-comedy or a straight horror film. Add to that the fact that Kevin Sorbo doesn't appear until halfway through the film and the fact that the idea of Stebbings (who has some pretty obvious wrinkles) being romantically interested in a high school girl is kind of creepy, and you've got a pretty flawed movie.Given that it was made-for-TV and on an obviously low-moderate budget (the werewolf looks like a stuffed grizzly bear), there is a surprisingly large amount of blood and gore. Less than you would find in a cinema-release horror movie, but more than in most telemovies. This might put off some viewers, especially those used to Sorbo's other telemovies (such as ""Avenging Angel"") which are extremely family friendly. Of course, this might also appeal to some viewers, in particular the teenagers whom this film is so obviously aimed at.Overall, in spite of its flaws, I enjoyed ""Never Cry Werewolf"". It's a fun film to watch and Sorbo's small role is cheesy but makes the film worthwhile. It might not be as good as other werewolf movies, such as ""Silver Bullet"", the ""American Werewolf"" films or ""Ginger Snaps"", but I still anticipate rewatching it sometime in the future, which, as far as I'm concerned, makes it worth the price of purchase.",3,"""Rear Window"" meets ""Fright Night""",1231891200,"01 14, 2009",2009,2276,"['Imagine', 'Rear', 'Window', 'Fright', 'Night', 'rolled', 'one', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Werewolf', 'about', 'Teenaged', 'Loren', 'Nina', 'Dobrev', 'something', 'odd', 'new', 'neighbour', 'Jared', 'Peter', 'Stebbings', 'so', 'spying', 'bedroom', 'window', 'using', 'brother', 'telescope', 'out', 'Jared', 'werewolf', 'serial', 'killer', 'police', 'wo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Loren', 'when', 'tell', 'Loren', 'deal', 'Jared', 'assistance', 'Redd', 'Tucker', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'washed-up', 'television', 'hunter', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Werewolf', 'entertaining', 'film', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'above', 'average', 'quality', 'However', 'something', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'right', 'mind', 'scenes', 'appear', 'logical', 'sequence', 'form', 'coherent', 'story', 'something', 'disjoint', 'point', 'being', 'almost', 'episodic', 'director', 'never', 'quite', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'horror-comedy', 'straight', 'horror', 'film', 'Add', 'fact', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', ""n't"", 'appear', 'halfway', 'film', 'fact', 'idea', 'Stebbings', 'who', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'wrinkles', 'being', 'romantically', 'interested', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'kind', 'creepy', ""'ve"", 'got', 'pretty', 'flawed', 'movie.Given', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'obviously', 'low-moderate', 'budget', 'werewolf', 'stuffed', 'grizzly', 'bear', 'surprisingly', 'large', 'amount', 'blood', 'gore', 'Less', 'would', 'find', 'cinema-release', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'most', 'telemovies', 'might', 'put', 'off', 'viewers', 'especially', 'used', 'Sorbo', 'other', 'telemovies', 'such', 'Avenging', 'Angel', 'are', 'extremely', 'family', 'friendly', 'course', 'might', 'also', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'particular', 'teenagers', 'whom', 'film', 'so', 'obviously', 'aimed', 'at.Overall', 'spite', 'flaws', 'enjoyed', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Werewolf', 'fun', 'film', 'watch', 'Sorbo', 'small', 'role', 'cheesy', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'werewolf', 'movies', 'such', 'Silver', 'Bullet', 'American', 'Werewolf', 'films', 'Ginger', 'Snaps', 'still', 'anticipate', 'rewatching', 'sometime', 'future', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'price', 'purchase']",Never Cry Werewolf

When people go missing and strange things begin to happen at Jared's home, Loren does a bit of investigating and discovers that her neighbor favors a full moon.Jared, on the other hand, believes that Loren is his long lost love reincarnated.  He'll stop at nothing to win (or at the least take aggressively) her love.Enter Redd Tucker (a hilarious Kevin Sorbo), a man's man-type of television hunter who's actually a complete poser.  Loren enlists him and a neighbor with a huge crush on her, Steven (Sean O'Neill), to help her stop Jared's murderous ways.  What ensues is a mix of humor, light horror, and decent special effects.For what it is, ""Never Cry Werewolf"" works.  It's not a great film, but it won't leave you feeling as if you've wasted an entire afternoon or evening watching it.  It has a bit of everything for fans of the werewolf genre, including a wicked ""pet"" that's actually one of the highlights of the film.Dobrev, Sorbo and Stebbings all do good jobs in their respective roles.  Dobrev in particular did a very convincing job as Loren.  She also appears to have channelled Jessica Biel a la ""Blade: Trinity"" for her outfit (which suits her just fine).  Sorbo hams it up with his character.  This might turn off some viewers, but I found myself pulling for his pitiful character once he enters the story.  Stebbings pulled of his character's sinister streak perfectly, making Jared quite believeable.Much like many of its predecessors, the film uses a lot of humor to move the story along.  This borders on campiness at times, but the film manages to stay grounded enough in the horror vein that you won't think you're watching a spoof.In summary, ""Never Cry Werewolf"" has its problems, but relishes in the fact that those problems are what give the film its character.  A likeable cast, decent special effects and a good (though unoriginal) story make ""Never Cry Werewolf"" a three star film.

Tresca ""Talien""","[5, 6]","Have you ever had the feeling that the guy who moved into the house where the registered sex offender was murdered was a werewolf?  Then you might want to see this movie. If instead you suspect he's a vampire, then seeFright Night.  If he's just your run-of-the-mill psychopath thenDisturbiamight be a better suggestion.You see, all of these movies are about a protagonist confined to their home with a really creepy neighbor. Said neighbor has a dark secret, but only our house-bound hero knows the truth.  The fun part is that he does everything a logical person would do: scream, tell his friends, and call the police.  Due to disadvantages ranging from physical disability to social status, nobody believes him.  And so it's up to our hero and perhaps a few unwitting fools to battle the monster in his lair.Never Cry Werewolf has a few differences, but they're skin deep. The werewolf (Peter Stebbings as Jared Martin) has a creepy allure worthy of a vampire; seems 16-year-old Loren Hansett (Nina Dobrev) reminds him of his long lost love. He also has an ill-tempered dog and a motorcycle, which makes him something of a celebrity in the small town.  When prostitutes begin disappearing, Loren becomes increasingly desperate, culminating in a visit to Stebbings' house.  Which is exactly what he wanted all along...Never Cry Werewolf gets several things right.  The werewolf myth is accurate; medieval scholars believed one could become a werewolf by wearing a strip of flesh from an evil man, which is precisely how Stebbings' power works (and why he murdered the sex offender).  He is accompanied by a black dog, his familiar - embracing the magical side of werewolf lore.  Despite the obvious age difference between Stebbings and Hansett, he has an animal magnetism she finds difficult to resist.  Sure, it's a little creepy that an older man is literally sniffing around a younger girl - but then, this is a horror movie, right?Just likeFright Night, Never Cry Werewolf ropes in a has-been celebrity (Kevin Sorbo as Redd Tucker) who unwillingly joins the fight, only to find his acting skills are more useful than his legendary persona. Complicating matters is lovesick Steven Kepkie (Sean O'Neill) who has a crush on Loren, and her younger brother Kyle (Spencer Van Wyck) who is just an all-around pain in the neck. What's a teenage girl to do?Kick butt and take names, that's what. WhereFright Nightwas a coming-of-age tale in the 80s, Never Cry Werewolf is a grrl-power parable in the tradition ofBuffy the Vampire Slayer.  By the time Hansett strips down to her black sports bra, she's all woman.The werewolf effects are suitably menacing, the acting predictably cheesy, and the plot keeps tongue firmly in snout.  Never Cry Werewolf may not be very original, but then neither wasFright Night.  If you happen to be a photographer with a broken leg living next door to a salesman carrying mysterious heavy packages, you might be interested in a little film calledRear Window...",3,Tongue firmly in snout,1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,2990,"['Have', 'ever', 'had', 'feeling', 'guy', 'who', 'moved', 'house', 'where', 'registered', 'sex', 'offender', 'was', 'murdered', 'was', 'werewolf', 'Then', 'might', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'instead', 'suspect', 'vampire', 'then', 'seeFright', 'Night', 'just', 'run-of-the-mill', 'psychopath', 'thenDisturbiamight', 'be', 'better', 'suggestion.You', 'see', 'movies', 'are', 'protagonist', 'confined', 'home', 'really', 'creepy', 'neighbor', 'Said', 'neighbor', 'dark', 'secret', 'only', 'house-bound', 'hero', 'truth', 'fun', 'part', 'everything', 'logical', 'person', 'would', 'do', 'scream', 'tell', 'friends', 'call', 'police', 'Due', 'disadvantages', 'ranging', 'physical', 'disability', 'social', 'status', 'nobody', 'up', 'hero', 'perhaps', 'few', 'unwitting', 'fools', 'battle', 'monster', 'lair.Never', 'Cry', 'Werewolf', 'few', 'differences', ""'re"", 'skin', 'deep', 'werewolf', 'Peter', 'Stebbings', 'Jared', 'Martin', 'creepy', 'allure', 'worthy', 'vampire', '16-year-old', 'Loren', 'Hansett', 'Nina', 'Dobrev', 'long', 'lost', 'love', 'also', 'ill-tempered', 'dog', 'motorcycle', 'something', 'celebrity', 'small', 'town', 'When', 'begin', 'disappearing', 'Loren', 'increasingly', 'desperate', 'culminating', 'visit', 'Stebbings', 'house', 'Which', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Werewolf', 'several', 'things', 'right', 'werewolf', 'myth', 'accurate', 'medieval', 'scholars', 'believed', 'one', 'could', 'become', 'werewolf', 'wearing', 'strip', 'flesh', 'evil', 'man', 'precisely', 'how', 'Stebbings', 'power', 'works', 'why', 'murdered', 'sex', 'offender', 'accompanied', 'black', 'dog', 'familiar', 'embracing', 'magical', 'side', 'werewolf', 'lore', 'obvious', 'age', 'difference', 'Stebbings', 'Hansett', 'animal', 'magnetism', 'difficult', 'resist', 'Sure', 'little', 'creepy', 'older', 'man', 'literally', 'sniffing', 'younger', 'girl', 'then', 'horror', 'movie', 'right', 'Just', 'likeFright', 'Night', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Werewolf', 'has-been', 'celebrity', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'Redd', 'Tucker', 'who', 'unwillingly', 'fight', 'only', 'find', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'more', 'useful', 'legendary', 'persona', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'lovesick', 'Steven', 'Kepkie', 'Sean', ""O'Neill"", 'who', 'crush', 'Loren', 'younger', 'brother', 'Kyle', 'Spencer', 'Van', 'Wyck', 'who', 'just', 'all-around', 'pain', 'neck', 'What', 'teenage', 'girl', 'do', 'Kick', 'butt', 'take', 'names', 'what', 'WhereFright', 'Nightwas', 'coming-of-age', 'tale', '80s', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Werewolf', 'grrl-power', 'parable', 'tradition', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'time', 'Hansett', 'down', 'black', 'sports', 'bra', 'woman.The', 'werewolf', 'effects', 'are', 'suitably', 'menacing', 'acting', 'predictably', 'cheesy', 'plot', 'tongue', 'firmly', 'snout', 'Never', 'Cry', 'Werewolf', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'original', 'then', 'wasFright', 'Night', 'happen', 'be', 'photographer', 'broken', 'leg', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'salesman', 'carrying', 'mysterious', 'heavy', 'packages', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'little', 'film', 'calledRear', 'Window']",Never Cry Werewolf

The similarities between Never Cry Werewolf and Fright Night, i.e. The washed up actor ( Peter Vincent in Fright Night ) role now played by Kevin Sorbo.  The kid next door ( Charlie in Fright Night ) now played by Nina Dobrev and the Chris Sarandan Vampire role, now played by Peter Stebbings as a Werewolf.Jared ( Peter Stebbings ), thinks his next door neighbor Loren, ( Nina Dobrev ) is the reincarnation of his wife Melissa.  Loren suspects Jared isn't just an average guy when one night she sees him come home with a woman, then hears said woman scream.  From then on, she spies on him through a high powered telescope.  One day she manages to break into his house and sees a large pot on the stove, cooking.  Inside is eyeball stew and her suspicions are confirmed that Jared is indeed a monster.Loren and one of her guy friends decide to enlist the help of Redd Tucker, ( Kevin Sorbo ) a television action star who is known as a big game hunter.  While at the sports / rifle shop that Redd is, Jared and his guard dog show up, and Loren's friend is nicked by Jared, so now he will become a werewolf as well.  Jared's gaurd dog is killed by Loren, but Redd takes the credit and now his once flagging career is a hot commodity again.Loren's friend begins to turn that night and resists hurting her because he cares for her.  Loren knows the only way to save her friend is to either kill him or kill the one who turned him before midnight that night, when the first full moon appears.  She rushes to Redd, who is still giving interviews about his, ""kill"" and Loren asks him to help kill the werewolf next door.  He tells her his secret, that he never was a big game hunter per say, just a really good actor.  His television kills were all staged and the animal heads in his trailers are merely props and not real.  Loren says she will stop Jared on her own then, because she can't have more deaths on her conscience.Jared meanwhile, has kidnapped Loren's younger brother and he wants Loren to come over so he can turn her so they can be mated, as was predestined.  What ensues is a battle to the finish between Loren, Redd, her friend and Jared.The acting by everyone was good and the movie moved along at a good pace.  It's not a scary horror movie, really.

I really think that channel's previously awful Saturday night  (and sometimes Sunday night) science fiction/fantasy/horror movies of the week have gotten a lot better in terms of actors, acting, production values, writing, special effects, and overall watch-ability. While I would never say any of these films were truly great works of the genre, _Never Cry Werewolf_ was one of the better ones they have produced in recent years.Several things made the movie enjoyable for me. First of all, the movie, whether you want to say it is in homage to or rips off (I prefer the former, not the latter) a classic movie tradition, namely, that of a neighbor, usually one who is somehow ""weak"" or powerless to act, witnesses something terrible next door but only this neighbor knows what is going on and it is up to the neighbor (and a few trusted friends) to do something about  it . The classic example is of course Alfred Hitchcock's _Rear Window_, but other more recent examples include the third _Mimic_ movie and Shia LeBeouf in _Disturbia_. In this case, a teen-aged girl by the name  of Loren Hansett starts to piece together something about her handsome new neighbor (played by Peter Stebbings). Is he a serial killer?  A cannibal? No, but close, he is a werewolf. Though  Loren first goes a fairly conventional route, calling the authorities, the evil new neighbor is pretty slick as he has done this thing before, hiding his affliction and the bodies. So the young woman and her friends take it upon themselves to deal with the werewolf.The young woman, Loren, was quite good. She was a pretty good actress and quite attractive (the actress being Nina Dobrev).Though at the end she might have been channeling too much Sarah Conner from _Terminator 2_ or Buffy, she was went a long way in making the movie enjoyable.I also liked Kevin Sorbo's character, Redd Tucker, a man who on TV plays the big game hunter to beat all game hunters but in reality is a just an actor who only plays at being a big game hunter on TV and whose star is in decline (doesn`t his name just sound too good to be true for a mighty hunter?). He is sought out by the young woman but she is disappointed to find out the truth, that he is a just a washed out phony. At first understandably reluctant to help the young lady, the mighty hunter gets involved when circumstances force him into it. At first he is involved in fighting the werewolf merely out of a combination of personal and professional self-preservation but he eventually does it because it is the right thing to do. I liked the character in part because it poked fun at previous roles Sorbo had played.The movie also had some real humor. While not really a comedy, it was light-hearted, didn't take itself too seriously without being campy, and wasn't a shrieking gore-fest.I liked it. Some of my friends are disbelieving, having seen some of the awful fare that the Sci Fi Channel has put out and wonder at my sanity for liking ANY of their movies but I really liked this film.

1167898,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B001AR0D5Y,trashcanman,"[28, 40]","""Never Cry Werewolf"" is the very definition of horror lite.  I'm about sick and tired of PG-13 DVD's being advertised as ""unrated"".  Don't get me wrong, this isn't an unwatchable mess of a film that will leave you angry about the 90 minutes of your life you can never get back, but if you watch werewolf movies for gore, nudity, and terror than don't hesitate to pass this by.  This is another intended for the tween crowd.The lead actress is one thing this flick has going for it.  Doe-eyed brunette cutie-pie Nina Dobrev pretty much carries this entire film and she does a pretty solid job at it.  Geek demi-icon Kevin Sorbo (Hercules The Legendary Journeys) is slightly amusing as a celebrity outdoorsman tapped by our heroine to help her take out her new neighbor, who for some reason can turn into a werewolf at will by wrapping a strip of some pervert's neckskin around his knuckles.  Yeeeeaaaah, the werewolf mythology on this one is shaky at best.  Also, he can bite people and apparently turn them into living lycanthropic plastic surgery disasters.  Whatever.  Throw in a pathetic love interest with awful emo hair, an annoying little brother, the creepiest dog this side ofCujo, and a pot of eyeball stew and you've got a lame-but-watchable horror romp that even my two year old son laughed at.  A lot.  There's some blood splatter going on, but very little actual gore unless you count a wolf exploding into translucent goo as gore.  I do not.While ""Never Cry Werewolf"" offers some creeps, a hot protagonist, and a pretty cool werewolf (realistic: no.  Cool: yes.) there is not enough to scratch that horror itch.  There is however, some cannibalism which can only help.  The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good.  But probably half of the scenes are ripped off wholesale from other films.  That is bad.  Couple making out in car hears noise, boy steps out to investigate upon girl's urging.  Gee, I wonder what happens next?  Lameness, that's what.  Telepathic werewolf: why?!?!  Reincarnated lost love?  That's not even a werewolf movie convention, that's eithera mummyor acrummy vampire flick!  Come on!  They even rip offHitchcock, though I imagine a lot of people will think it'sShia Leboufbeing robbed.  I can say that I've genuinely never seen a werewolf take a hostage to use as a human shield to protect himself from the assault of a teenage girl before.  I wish I could still say that.  So much wrong.As bad as this movie is, it is still better thanCursed, and that one had gore.  There is some smirk-worthy humor, a few genuinely creepy bits -most involving that damn dog-, and did I mention the attractiveness of the lead actress?  All-around a watchable movie, but just don't go in thinking you're getting a full-on unrated frightfest.  This is a bare-bones release, but I don't imagine there'd be any special features I'd actually want to watch anyway.  Have a look if you're in a light-hearted mood and have seen every other werewolf movie.  And if you have seen every other werewolf movie; my condolences on having sat through the unspeakably terrible Howling sequels.  Those make this one look likeAn American Werewolf in London.2 1/2 stars, rounded down for false advertising.Again, do not sell a PG-13 DVD with an ""unrated""label!

1167899,A2ONX15N6TWDR,B001AR0D5Y,Vincenzo L.,"[1, 1]","Wow.  What can I say about this one, that hasn't already been said?  Yeah - it is a blatant rip-off of the 80s classic FRIGHT NIGHT, only it substitutes a werewolf for the vampire as the main antagonist.  The acting is wooden, the plot is weak, and the scares are predictable.So, why two stars?  Well, for one - Kevin Sorbo.  He plays a great 'reluctant hero' type, and provides the much needed humor this film is lacking.  He is the 'Peter Vincent' of this film, and was well chosen.  I just wonder how drunk he had to get to agree to this project.  Star number two - Nina Dobrev - while not quite up to the acting talent of Sorbo, she does make the rest of the cast look amateurish, and she is extremely soft on the eyes.I usually can watch a film several times over - even if it isn't 'the best' of films, I can find a redeeming quality or two that makes it if not re-watchable, then something I can put on as background noise.  Not so with this one.

1167900,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B001AR0D5Y,Wuchak,"[0, 1]","I don't get the lukewarm reviews as ""Never Cry Werewolf"" (2008) is a worthy addition to the werewolf genre. Yes, it rips-off the plot of a popular film from two decades earlier, ""Fright Night"" and, yes, it is a made-for-TV flick, but despite these factors it delivers as a half-serious/half-comedy werewolf flick.PLOT: A mysterious man (Peter Stebbings) moves in next door to teenager Loren (Nina Dobrev) and she concludes that he's a werewolf. Of course, no one believes her so she enlists the help of a washed-up reality show actor (Kevin Sorbo).Like I said, ""Never Cry Werewolf"" only plays it semi-straight, so don't expect the dead-serious vibe of, say, ""wolfen"" or even ""Red Riding Hood.""Stebbings is reminiscent of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine here and is excellent in the role. But he's clearly at least 36 years-old and so it's a bit disturbing that he's literally sniffing around a 16 year-old girl.Nina is good as the protagonist and has a cute look, but I prefer her redheaded friend in the story, Angie, played by Melanie Leishman. Melanie may not be as cute but she has better curves. In any event, her role is too small.As always, Sorbo is extremely likable. He plays a reluctant hero in this one.The film was shot in Brantford & Hamilton, Ontario, and runs 87 minutes.FINAL WORD: Although ""Never Cry Werewolf"" loses points for blatantly ripping off ""Fright Night,"" the bottom line is that it's entertaining from beginning to end. The werewolf lore is researched and the cast is solid. In addition, the werewolf looks menacing and there's a lot of goofy gore. It's just a fun film.
