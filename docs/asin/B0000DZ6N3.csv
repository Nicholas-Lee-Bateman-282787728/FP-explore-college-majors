The movie is about a friendship between a young lady who just lost her dad and has to grow up and a little girl who acts like an adult. Unfortunately, the young girl also loses her dad, but the young lady is there for her. She knows what it's like to lose both parents. I think it's nice that they have each other and they teach other to act according to how old they really are. It's romantic, funny and has some drama. I could relate to the Brittany Murphy character 'cause I lost my dad recently and I have to grow up (be independent). I noticed that they dressed them up really well, which is excellent.

779966,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0000DZ6N3,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 4]","Brittany Murphy needs better roles.  I don't know how to explain this further, but I do not believe that she has quite found her stride yet.  As I look through her catalog of 20-something films, it surprises me that I can only say that I have enjoyed about a teaspoon of her work.  Even as I look through the titles like Sin City, Little Black Book, and Girl, Interrupted, I cannot help but think that perhaps it wasn't her roles in these films that caught my attention, but instead the story, style, and power of the other, stronger, characters.  She has yet to come forward and surprise us all with her hidden talent.  Uptown Girls is a glowing example of Murphy not quite gaining her stride, but finding herself in the aura of a stronger actress.  The story surrounding Uptown Girls is flimsy and brittle.  Murphy's character carries no emotion or depth at all, which only proceeds to corrupt the story even further.  Thankfully, we are not forced to drag our feet through the film with only the likes of Murphy to carry us, thankfully, we have a young, and highly inspirational Dakota Fanning, to add some levity to the project.Uptown Girls is not a good film in any way shape or form.  I have mentioned before that the story itself really held no merit at all.  Here we have the story of a wealthy girl that cannot handle responsibility, whom ultimately learns the key values in life from a clich&eacute; child character that has been created in nearly every film released in the past decade.  Plotholes seem to be endless and frequent, while unexplained coincidences seem to plague the very root of this story.  It is yet another classic example of Hollywood attempting to give us the sympathy character (Murphy) while never quite explaining the hurdle of money, past, or reason.  We have entire scenes, which revolve around a relationship that seems like it was developed in high school, not real life.  Murphy tries to juggle a job, a non-existent, yet existent love life, and friendship, while still proving that she is a strong individual.  Whew.  Yet, through all of this mess (in which Murphy seems to lead us), there is a glimmer of light.  Dakota Fanning.  I mentioned her name before, but I feel as if I should explain in some detail.  Dakota is a talented actress.  At the ripe young age that she is, I feel as if we have only seen the cusp of her talent.  I believe that Oscar will reward her one-day and she so deserves it.  There were moments in this film when Dakota literally took this feeble story and made it her own.  She stole every scene away from Murphy and proceeded to make a film that showcased her talent.  For such a young actress, this was an impressive feat.  Fanning owned this film, and it was demonstrated in every scene she graced.Outside of Fanning, the rest of the film was dismal.  Director Boaz Yakin has shown us in the past that he can create decent work.  Even in this film, there are scenes that just jumped from the screen.  One that comes to mind is the way he set the camera up so that when Murphy and Fanning meet for the second time, Murphy is reflected off Fanning's sunglasses.  It was a brilliant shot, sadly, it was the only worthwhile piece of photography throughout the entire film.  Yakin could have taken this feature and transformed it into this rather dark insight into the world of the wealthy and privileged.  Instead, we are forced to watch this below-mediocre film that yields to age-old Hollywood clich&eacute;s and unanswered questions.  Perhaps most has to do with Murphy and her inability to go beyond the ditzy blonde image, but I think more has to do with Yakin.  He has been bought by the glamour of Hollywood and has found that their images can be found through his eyes.  Where was that cunning director that gave us that inspirational film Fresh?  I didn't see that same director anywhere in this picture.  Yet another decent director has found that money can prevail over creativity.Overall, this was a truly uninspiring film.  With low-grade actors attempting to bring some life to the shattering script (like Heather Locklear as Fanning's mother), we only are left with more of a mess than what we began with.  Fanning carries this movie and honestly gives us a better performance than the entire crew put together.  I believe that she could have been the only person in this film and it would have been 100% better.  We needed more background on Murphy, like her passion for her parents, her devotion to her friends, or her inability to cope with reality, instead of being rushed right into unmanned situations without explanation only to find most laughing instead of asking the question ... why?  This was a pathetic attempt to show the effects of parenting on children, using copious clich&eacute;s to make the general audiences feel comfortable.  See this movie for the talent of Dakota Fanning, but skip everything else.

My husband and kids thought this was very amusing!  In any case, this movie grows on you. The characters are believable. Brittany Murphy as Molly (and I hated &quot;Just Married-not her, just the movie) is very likable, warm and appealing.  Dakota Fanning as Ray, the old-beyond-her-years eight-year-old who prefers Mozart Requieum to pop music, is genuine in her transition from bitterness and loneliness to expressing and enjoying life as a child.  The movie is so likable for the sum of its parts. The supporting characters all work as well.  There are several touching scenes-the &quot;spinning teacup scene&quot; and the &quot;Molly Smiles&quot; ballet at the end.  I'll leave the plot up to the other reviews as usual, but I will say that the ballet at the end is very touching.

That is the wonderful combination of Brittany Murphy (so sad she's left us) and Dakota Fanning.  Fanning is a delight in her `too mature for her own good' role as Ray, a humorless young girl who needs a nanny because her mother has no time for her.  Murphy also shines as Molly, an heiress reluctant to work for herself yet forced to do so when she loses her fortune.  Together they learn from one another (obviously) and build such a heartwarming finale, which was unexpected.  Sure, it isn't the perfect film, but it has enough charm and heart to make it well worthwhile.  Fanning has the chops to deliver the funny (this girl was the epitome of perfect child star) and she plays off of Murphy with ease.

I was expecting a Legally Blonde knockoff with a precocious little girl. Instead, I got an extremely heart felt movie that's not quite so ditzy as I thought, but actually quite thoughtful and oddly tearjerking. The previews, I felt, were extremely misleading, making the movie look a lot ditzier than it actually is. Molly (Brittany Murphy) is so wrapped up in her own life that she's blindsided when she learns that all her money is gone. What's a girl to do? She ends up becoming the nanny for paranoid little Ray (Dakota Fanning). And of course, they learn from one another.

On her birthday party in a nightclub, she meets Lorraine ""Ray"" Schleine (Dakota Fanning), a nasty young girl with attitudes of adult , living with her careless mother and a terminal father in a fancy uptown apartment. When the accountant of Molly vanishes with her US$ 100,000,000.00 inheritance, Molly is left with nothing but debts, and she needs to work to survive without having previous experience or any skills. She is hired to be Ray's babysitter, and their close contact makes Molly reach the maturity and Ray act like as a child of her age.The film's weakest link is the script, it simply isn't enough to hold your attention all the way through and descends into cliche-ridden moments which do nothing to emphasise the talents of the two leads.",2,Disappointing but Cute at Times,1133740800,"12 5, 2005",2005,1021,"['New', 'York', 'City', 'Molly', 'Gunn', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'spoiled', 'wealthy', 'immature', 'young', 'woman', 'living', 'were', 'princess', 'fairy', 'tale', 'father', 'was', 'popular', 'rock-and-roll', 'guitar', 'player', 'who', 'died', 'plane', 'crash', 'Molly', 'mother', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'birthday', 'party', 'nightclub', 'Lorraine', 'Ray', 'Schleine', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'nasty', 'young', 'girl', 'attitudes', 'adult', 'living', 'careless', 'mother', 'terminal', 'father', 'fancy', 'uptown', 'apartment', 'When', 'accountant', 'Molly', 'vanishes', 'US', '100,000,000.00', 'inheritance', 'Molly', 'left', 'nothing', 'debts', 'work', 'survive', 'having', 'previous', 'experience', 'skills', 'hired', 'be', 'Ray', 'babysitter', 'close', 'contact', 'Molly', 'reach', 'maturity', 'Ray', 'act', 'child', 'age.The', 'film', 'weakest', 'link', 'script', 'simply', ""n't"", 'enough', 'hold', 'attention', 'way', 'descends', 'cliche-ridden', 'moments', 'do', 'nothing', 'emphasise', 'talents', 'two', 'leads']",Uptown Girls

And since I review hundreds of films on both yahoo and Amazon, I thought I would give this a fair review too.The reason I give this 3 stars and not 4 or 5 is because perhaps I am biased and dont really enjoy chick flick films.  The strengths of this film of course lie in a mix of emotions and a bonding between a girl who is 8 (Fanning as Ray)and acts like she is 30 in maturity but has some character flaws in the sense that she skipped childhood.  She is of course vulnerable emotionally, in a very similar way Britney (as Molly Gunn) plays her character.  Fanning of course steals the show with her brilliant acting leaving Britney almost like she's playing catch up because she cant keep up with this girl at times.  The acting talent difference is why I give this a B- overall rating and not a A-.  I think Britney barely pulls of a believeable actor to match Fannings qualities.  This movie really doesnt pull surprises.  It simply lays it out simply.  A girl who acts like a 30 year old who missed childhood from an uncaring mother, and Britney as Molly who is rich and also had nobody to care for her, but she stayed as a child and never grew up and never matured. Of course the two meet and both share a bit of each others life and Fay and  Molly have a special relationship.  The girl teaches Molly how to grow up and be independent; Molly teaches her how to have a childhood, be fun and most of all have someone care for her and be a mother like figure.

I saw her in ""Just Married"" with Ashton Kutcher and was impressed which led me to this film.  I thought it was a comedy instead it's a drama with comedic elements.  Essentially it's the story of two wounded souls who need each other despite their reluctance.  Molly (Murphy) is twenty-two year old rock 'n' roll royalty who compensates for the loss of her parents with impulsive and erratic behavior. Ray(Dakota Fanning) is an eight year old girl who tries to act years beyond her age to assuage the hurt caused by an absentee mother and comatose father.  Both Molly and Ray harbor some form of OCD.  For Molly it's a hoarders mentality and for Ray there's an obsession with order and cleanliness.  Circumstance brings the two together and some would say the movie is somewhat contrived.

And it was all correct. There were absolutly no surprises in this wahtsoever. There was a set-up used in dozens of films before this. There was nothing new. It was a romantic comedy that I should have rented instead of paying to see it in the theatre.Brittany Murphy plays Molly Gunn, the rock and roll princess. She lives off of the profits from her deceased parents, who played in a band. With not one bone in her body not spoiled or immature, instead of working for a living, she uses her spare time to hang out with her friends Ingrid and Huey. But at her birthday party, she falls for the entertainment, singer and songwriter Neil Fox. After spending an entire weekand in her house, Molly becomes Neil's muse. But Neil decides that Molly is not mature enough to be in a real relationship. After he leaves however, her lights go out.It turns out that the man controlling her trust fund takes all of her money and flees the country. Her electric, water, and gas all go out of her house, and she is forced to get a job to live a normal life. After getting fired from a department store, Huey gets Molly a job babysitting a record exeutive's daughter Ray. Ray's been through many nanny's in the past and Molly instantly tries to become friends with Ray, who acts years ahead of her age. Molly also finds out that Ray's mother Roma doesn't spead time with her daughter and hardly knows her emotional needs. Her father however, is in a coma, and is being treated in the house library so Ray can see him anytime. Over the course of weeks Molly and Ray both help the other one to act their own age, of course learning other things along the way.Uptown Girls was your typical romantic comedy except worse. They was absolutly no surprises and nothing funny. In totel I laughed at how Molly has a pig as a pet, and another part which I can't even remember when. Uptown Girls just didn't do it for me. I could probally have told you everything that happened in that movie without even seeing it. Of course, watching the movie allowed me to guess what would happen, so all your have to do is give me a few highlights from the movie and I could tell you everything that happens, without seeing it. If the Oscars had the most predictable movie award this one would win with flying colors. Probally one of the weakest and worst movies of 2003.

779997,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B0000DZ6N3,General Breadbasket,"[8, 9]","Brittany Murphy, Dakota Fanning and a pig called Mu star in the curious comedy ""Uptown Girls"", directed by Boaz Yakin. It's a bit of a mixed bag, I thought. There were parts I liked, parts I hated, parts I was intrigued by, and parts that just left me baffled. Overall, I liked it though.Molly (Brittany Murphy), is the daughter of a late rock star, and lives off his wealth, in decadence, within a large apartment, along with her pet pig Mu. She is fairly superficial, as are her friends, and Molly's rather childish too. Sometime after her 22nd birthday, her late father's manager runs off with all the money she'd been living from, leaving her with nothing. She is kicked out of her apartment and has to find a job. She ends up becoming a nanny to ""Ray"" (Dakota Fanning), an uptight, smart alecy, germophobe of a little girl, the daughter of a wealthy record executive. They are certainly an odd couple, and some comic scenes follow, but its not all laughs. As the two girls spend time together, there are many a touching and dramatic moment as they realise they have a lot in common, both being a little eccentric, both being the daughters of wealthy families, and both having certain tragedies in their lives they're yet to cope with.I wouldn't exactly call this a straight ahead comedy. Though there is a love interest for Molly as well, a Morrissey-esque rock singer (Jesse Spencer) she meets at her birthday party, I wouldn't call this a romantic comedy either, as this fellow isn't the main focus of the film, and their relationship isn't exactly conventional. Neither of them really seem interested in each other, yet they come together, on again off again. The whole film was just this kaleidescope of elements, tumbling around within the plot.Though I was a little put off at first, I found this film fascinating. It was interesting to see characters first potrayed as parodies show a depth later on, while characters who seemed more three dimensional later showed a shallower side. No one here was exactly a carciature, but no one again was exactly completely real. It was a refreshing mix of the two, and I think they all pulled it off fairly well.Special features include a quite large selection of deleted and alternate scenes, including a sex scene or two for some reason, as well as a behind the scenes featurette with interviews with the actors and director Boaz Yakin, a featurette about the fashion of the film, a montage of stills, the original movie trailer and a music video for ""Time"" by Chantal Kreviazuk, which looks pretty standard for a movie soundtrack music video (shots of singer singing interdispersed with footage from the film, etc). I would have preferred to see a music video for the songs Jesse Spencer's rock singer character sings, I quite liked those, they were funny and catchy, one of my favorite parts of the film.An intriguing comedy, got me thinking by the end of it.

780000,ABFJYHVD8RHLE,B0000DZ6N3,Hillary,"[1, 6]","I have watched this DVD many times with my daughter who enjoys it.  I enjoy it too, but even though the story of Molly Gunn, an heiress to her deceased parents fortune, is likeable, her character is also irritatingly unrealistic.  She is like Edie Sedgwick minus the drugged out debauchery.  How can someone have so much and have no clue to reality being in the world alone? Someone like this would be extra street smart having to make it with no guidance but then there would be no movie.If you can stand that much, we start on Mollys birthday leaving her pig Moo in her apartment on her carefree dizzy way to her own surprise birthday party.  She there experiences love at first sight with the British Singer who entertains at the party and has to have him even though like Morrisey as they say, is happily celibate.She also meets Rae (Dakota Fanning)a charmingly hateful and pre-wizened 8 year old with a Rock Manager Mogul mom, played by Heather Locklear.  Molly thinks nothing of the little snob who puts her down very efficiently until escorted back to her table.Molly soon finds herself with the rocker she so had to have, then rejects, then gets desperate when he rejects her back, and what is worse, she is in the dark, with no bills paid and NO money after her ""parents guy Bob"" embezzles the fortune and leaves her with nothing.Faced with finding employment is a daunting task, especially for a ditzy irresponsible flower child in the wrong decade like Molly.  But, she finds a job taking care of, guess who? RAE!How does this all go for Molly and Rae, watch and see.This movie is enjoyable and entertaining.  You could definitely see it more than once, but somehow it is mired in a mood of melancholy for a movie that was meant to be mostly light and fun, or is it?  I am not sure what the writers, director and producer were thinking.  It is a mix of a tearjerker and comedy, which is hard to pull off, yet this does, and does it pretty well.  Brittney Murphy is fairly likeable but somewhat irritating as mentioned before, and Dakota Fanning, well there is a softer side that Molly manages to uncover.All in all, a nice family oriented movie, but not exactly a light hearted romp as you would expect.  The fault here is many depressing moments leaving a cloud of depression over the entire film.

But I saw the trailer & knew I had to see this movie. Well I finally did & I was NOT dissapointed one bit. Easily my favorite movie of the summer. The first thing I'd like to say is please don't write this off as a chick flick. So what, it IS emotional, but there is hardly any romance. This movie is a dramatic comedy on a more serious note, unlike most of the movies that came out this summer. Brittany Murphy gives the best performance in her career as Molly Gunn, the rock n roll princess. She's never had to work for anything in her life or do anything for that matter. She's set for life, or so she thought. Since she never thought to insure her money (she's not very cautious about anything), her money manager runs off with her money to South America. Left with nothing, Molly has to move in with her best friend & gasp...get a job. Molly gets a job as maid & her main job is to take care of the little girl Ray, played magnificently by the very talented Dakota Fanning. When Molly first starts out, she thinks that it is impossible to get along with Ray. But with time, she comes to discover that Ray is going through some of the same things she herself went through as a child. It is a touching story as Molly tries breaking through Ray's disguise to find out about the real Ray. One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Brittany Murphy tells Ray's mother ""Of course you don't know what goes on between me and your daughter, because you don't even KNOW your own daughter"". On the way, they become best friends. I won't give away the ending, alot of things happen. The last 20 minutes of the movie are very emotional, and lots of people were crying in the theater. Unlike alot of the movies this summer, I felt this movie actually ended perfectly. Before the credits roll, we hear Ray say ""Every ending in life is only a beginning"". I really enjoyed this movie, and I think anyone who will give it a chance will too. Brittany Murphy earned a place as one of my favorite actresses, her performance in Uptown Girls is her best yet. And Dakota Fanning left me shocked. For someone so young, she gave one of the best performances I have seen from someone her age. The whole cast is terrific & the soundtrack to the movie is delightful. This movie made me (and everyone else) laugh, cry and dance. In my opinion, this movie is the best of the summer. The one I enjoyed the most. If you don't give this a chance, you will be missing out.

An accountant steals all her money and suddenly this unskilled party girl needs to get a job.

Brittany and Dakota go through the contest of wills stuff; Brittany falls for an up and coming rock 'n roller (actually more a balladeer); girl meets boy, girl loses boy, boy sleeps with girl's employer - you get the picture.

780008,A1FML9FCUPV6TI,B0000DZ6N3,J. M. Zuurbier,"[1, 1]","I enjoyed UPTOWN GIRLS with Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning. Brittany Murphy plays Molly, a spoiled young woman who's dad was a famous musician, and both her parents are dead. She likes to party and enjoy an expensive lifestyle. It comes to a halt when her electricity, phone line, everything is shut down since the bills have not been payed. She is evicted from her apartment and she learns that the man in charge of her finances has run off with her millions of dollars. She realizes she has to get a job. At first her best friend helps her but she loses that job, so another friend helps her get a job as a nanny.Enter Raye, the young girl Molly is to take care of. Raye is very short and ahead of her age in terms of knowledge. She is very disciplined and a bit harsh at times. They butt heads many times over many issues, but ultimately come together as Molly really comes to care for her, realizing how much of a lost soul she is since her father is in a coma and her mother (played by Heather Locklear) is never around to notice her. There are some really touching moments.As well Brittany falls for a hopeful rock star. This part of the story was the least interesting for me, and confusing. At first she tells her best friend Ingrid (who she has a falling out with but later makes up with her) that he is smothering her and he won't leave her apartment, that he keeps singing bad songs. Then two seconds later she is begging him not to go, it made no sense. Thank goodness she never got involved with him again.Brittany Murphy was very enjoyable in this movie, it was easy to relate and feel sympathetic to her character. Dakota Fanning is a child star to watch, she was excellent in this movie.

780009,A385C064Y38OFK,B0000DZ6N3,"John Dagley ""RonHowardFan@hotmail.com""","[7, 7]","On Saturday 6th December I saw 'Uptown Girls' with the gorgeousBrittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning.I first got interested in it when I saw an interview in a Whomagazine here with the director who said during this paragraph...According to New Yorker Yakin, Girls moonlights as a very personal,post-Sept. 11 love letter to the Big Apple: ""This movie makes NewYork look like no other movie has for 20 or 30 years"". To back thatlofty claim, he enlisted cinematographer Michael Ballhaus (freshfrom 'Gangs Of New York' and promises a ""beautiful, fairy-taleversion of what New York City can be"".He wasn't wrong. It was different. Really quite lovely in fact. Niceand refreshing even. There were different and classy camera anglesand I found the transitions from scene to scene unique and clever.Dakota was a spotless neat freak afraid of germs. She might almost beirritating if she wasn't so great, and so cute, and well deserving ofprevious roles before this.Brittany was also beautiful as can be as Molly Gunn. A girl down onher luck when it comes to finding work. You'd think anyone butBrittany might pull a gun on someone due to frustration, but notMolly. She might just shoot her mouth off at people instead, butwords can be harmless or meaningful, and when Brittany or Molly talksI want to listen. But you'll be pleased to hear she isn't out of worklong enough to consider any of this, when she is given a job as ababy sitter baby sitting Dakota. The child a mother can't properlylove, but someone who can really benefit from spending time withpeople her own age. While also using less sophisticated adultvocabulary.During the course of the movie, Molly finds love with a singer whocan't usually get a word in edgeways, sings a catchy tune to her forher birthday. At a time in the bathroom when Molly thinks of herselfas a 'hideous hag' when really that statement couldn't be furtherfrom the truth. Brittany just gets more and more adorable as timegoes on and her movies come out. This guy is just what he needs.Lucky Molly even gets a song for her from her spunky singingboyfriend, inspired by him after she spends a night in ""Sheets OfEgyptian Cotton"" with him. It is an instant hit as you'd imagine anysong about one of Brittany's character's might be. Any daughter of afamous singer would have to be an instant hit with the guys.Don't be fooled movie goers, ""This is not 'The Shinning'"". It is anupbeat movie for upbeat audiences. Full of fun but also somethingmeaningful. You could learn something worthwhile in this. Let youremotions go and have faith in Brittany that she will see you throughto the end of the film and leave you gasping for more after leavingyou in a spin, you may need to see it again, or have a tea party andinvite some guests, like the Mad Hatter and have crumpets. Don'tforget Alice or the White Rabbit. I hope he isn't late! There's notime like a Brittany Murphy movie!Everyone will be smiling along with Molly once they see 'UptownGirls', I assure you! That will mean Brittany will keep smiling, andwhy wouldn't she when her smile lights up the screen and fan's heartsso often? Keep smiling Brittany!I wonder if Billy Joel is also smiling thanks to his 'Uptown Girl'song, that is not in the movie. Oh no, Billy might not smile overthat, but I'm sure he couldn't think of any better girl then Brittanyor Dakota to be in a movie like his song. If that doesn't make Billysmile I don't know what will!

""Kimberly""","[2, 10]","In my opinon this movie is one of the most boring, and horribly written movies I've ever seen and I own 150 DVDs and go to the movie theater often. When, I saw the commericial for the film I had high hopes it looked like the classic coming of age-- learning from someone else chick flick. I made the mistake of buying the DVD before renting( I won't make that mistake again).The storyline is horrible-- in the movie Fanning's father is in a coma in the living room and Murphy has a pet pig that runs rampant around her apartment. Perhaps, an over-dramatized storyline is the reason why this movie is such a failure-- going to Coney Island and having it closed, or Fanning's runaway incident after the death of her comatose father or Fanning's mother's sleepovers while her father is in the living deliever a less than great movie.Murphy is horrible in this film and delievers the worst performance of her career as the little girl who never grew up-- [...]. And it looks like Murphy is coming off a heroin high throughout the movie. Fanning however, does a wonderful job as the eccentric little girl who has grown up before her years-- but she does not manage to salvage what is one of the worst films I've ever seen and the worst film of it's year(I believe it won that award in fact).You'll find yourself straining to stay awake--and find this movie should be used for torturing terrorist suspects.

780019,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000DZ6N3,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[33, 34]","In terms of the basic plot &quot;Uptown Girls&quot; is totally predictable.  Molly Gunn (Brittany Murphy) is a spoiled little rich girl who needs to grow up when she is forced to go out and get a job for the first time in her life.  Ray Schleine (Dakota Fanning) is an 8-year-old even littler little rich girl who is not only a hypochondriac and wise beyond her years but who needs to learn how to be a kid.  Of course circumstances throw them together when Molly becomes Ray's nanny.  There is the comic period of butting heads, the tentative beginnings of friendship, the point at which things blow up big time, and the heartfelt reconciliation.  But one of the reasons that formula films like this continue to be made is because more often than not they work.  The result is not a great film, but an enjoyable one where the best part of the film is the finale, where between them writers Julia Dahl, Mo Ogrodnik, Lisa Davidowitz and Allison Jacobs come up with a creative way of bringing together major plot elements.The twist with Molly Gunn is that she is the daughter of a rock 'n' roll legend, guitarist Tommy Gunn.  Her parents were killed in a plane crash when she was about Ray's age and she has been living off the residuals.  In her apartment there is a shrine in which all of her father's guitars are displayed, including the one on which he wrote his biggest hit, &quot;Molly Smiles,&quot; the song that Molly can no longer bear to here.  Molly might be spoiled, but she has a kind heart and not a mean bone in her body.  When her accountant steals all of her money and disappears she has her friends, Ingrid (Marley Shelton) and Huey (Donald Faison), who stay true and try to help her survive in the real world (I liked not having to do deal with her friends forgetting her now that she is broke).  She also likes Neal Fox (Jesse Spencer), the young musician who plays at her birthday party.  The only problem is that he is 274 days in his sobriety and wants to be celibate the first year.  But he too is inspired by Molly to write a song that becomes a hit.Ray's mother, Roma Schleine (Heather Locklear) runs a record label, which, of course, signs Neal.  This also explains why Ray needs a Nanny and we already know why the kid's attitude has a long procession of nanny's coming and going.  But beyond her immaculate room and her preoccupation with germs and disease, Ray has her own father issue: he suffered a stroke and is now a vegetable set up in the library of the apartment.  She seldom talks about her dad and she never visits him.  To Molly, this is just wrong, but she does not give the obvious speech.  Ray is smart enough to know what she would say and Molly bides her time until the time comes to say the right thing.  In the counter-part to that scene that comes shortly afterwards, Molly and Ray communicate a whole range of emotions without either one of them even saying a word.  Films like this rarely let silence speak so well on the behalf of the characters.Dakota Fanning was the best thing in &quot;Taken,&quot; and after her solid performance in &quot;I Am Sam&quot; it is nice to see her do a more comedic role in this film.  Count me in the growing list of those who think she could well be the Jodi Foster of her generation (to wit, she is better than Jodi Foster was at this age and you have the sense that she can make the transition from child star to adult star).  Brittany Murphy, who was wasted in &quot;Just Married&quot; and was asked to do something decidedly different in &quot;8 Mile,&quot; sinks her teeth into this role.  She has the ditzy parts down pat, but it is the honest moments that she shares with both Ray and Roma that she achieves her best grace notes in the film.  She should get a lot of opportunities to do more romantic comedies and as long as they have some basis in the real world and do not require her character to go over the top, she should thrive in such roles.Again, I want to applaud the creativity shown at the end of the film.  Coming up with a payoff at the end of a film like this is difficult, because you need something that brings the characters together in a happy ending.  What I like about this ending is that it achieves this without the characters involved ever making physical contact, by involving at least a half-dozen key plot elements, and, most importantly, by having the song we have been waiting almost the entire movie to hear be as good as it was supposed to be.  When you watch the film a second time pay attention to how the music is set up during the auction scene.  There might not be enough new here to make this a great film, but director Boaz Yakin has made &quot;Uptown Girls&quot; a nicely crafted formula film that more than meets our expectations.",4,A formula film that pulls together a pretty good ending,1077235200,"02 20, 2004",2004,4760,"['terms', 'basic', 'plot', 'quot', 'Uptown', 'Girls', 'quot', 'totally', 'predictable', 'Molly', 'Gunn', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'spoiled', 'little', 'rich', 'girl', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'when', 'forced', 'go', 'out', 'get', 'job', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'Ray', 'Schleine', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', '8-year-old', 'even', 'littler', 'little', 'rich', 'girl', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'hypochondriac', 'wise', 'years', 'who', 'learn', 'how', 'be', 'kid', 'course', 'circumstances', 'throw', 'together', 'when', 'Molly', 'Ray', 'nanny', 'comic', 'period', 'butting', 'heads', 'tentative', 'beginnings', 'friendship', 'point', 'things', 'blow', 'up', 'big', 'time', 'heartfelt', 'reconciliation', 'one', 'reasons', 'formula', 'films', 'continue', 'be', 'made', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'work', 'result', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'where', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'finale', 'where', 'writers', 'Julia', 'Dahl', 'Mo', 'Ogrodnik', 'Lisa', 'Davidowitz', 'Allison', 'Jacobs', 'come', 'up', 'creative', 'way', 'bringing', 'together', 'major', 'plot', 'elements.The', 'twist', 'Molly', 'Gunn', 'daughter', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'legend', 'guitarist', 'Tommy', 'Gunn', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'plane', 'crash', 'when', 'was', 'Ray', 'age', 'been', 'living', 'off', 'residuals', 'apartment', 'shrine', 'father', 'guitars', 'are', 'displayed', 'including', 'one', 'wrote', 'biggest', 'hit', 'quot', 'Molly', 'Smiles', 'quot', 'song', 'Molly', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'bear', 'here', 'Molly', 'might', 'be', 'spoiled', 'kind', 'heart', 'not', 'mean', 'bone', 'body', 'When', 'accountant', 'steals', 'money', 'friends', 'Ingrid', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'Huey', 'Donald', 'Faison', 'who', 'stay', 'true', 'try', 'help', 'survive', 'real', 'world', 'liked', 'not', 'having', 'do', 'deal', 'friends', 'forgetting', 'now', 'broke', 'also', 'Neal', 'Fox', 'Jesse', 'Spencer', 'young', 'musician', 'who', 'birthday', 'party', 'only', 'problem', '274', 'days', 'sobriety', 'be', 'celibate', 'first', 'year', 'too', 'inspired', 'Molly', 'write', 'song', 'hit.Ray', 'mother', 'Roma', 'Schleine', 'Heather', 'Locklear', 'record', 'label', 'course', 'signs', 'Neal', 'also', 'why', 'Ray', 'Nanny', 'already', 'know', 'why', 'kid', 'attitude', 'long', 'procession', 'nanny', 'coming', 'going', 'immaculate', 'room', 'preoccupation', 'germs', 'disease', 'Ray', 'own', 'father', 'issue', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'now', 'vegetable', 'set', 'up', 'library', 'apartment', 'seldom', 'talks', 'dad', 'never', 'Molly', 'just', 'wrong', 'not', 'give', 'obvious', 'speech', 'Ray', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'what', 'would', 'say', 'Molly', 'time', 'time', 'say', 'right', 'thing', 'counter-part', 'scene', 'shortly', 'afterwards', 'Molly', 'Ray', 'communicate', 'whole', 'range', 'emotions', 'one', 'even', 'saying', 'word', 'Films', 'rarely', 'let', 'silence', 'speak', 'so', 'well', 'behalf', 'characters.Dakota', 'Fanning', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'quot', 'Taken', 'quot', 'solid', 'performance', 'quot', 'Am', 'Sam', 'quot', 'nice', 'see', 'do', 'more', 'comedic', 'role', 'film', 'Count', 'growing', 'list', 'who', 'think', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'generation', 'wit', 'better', 'Jodi', 'Foster', 'was', 'age', 'have', 'sense', 'can', 'make', 'transition', 'child', 'star', 'adult', 'star', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'who', 'was', 'wasted', 'quot', 'Just', 'Married', 'quot', 'was', 'asked', 'do', 'something', 'decidedly', 'different', 'quot', '8', 'Mile', 'quot', 'teeth', 'role', 'ditzy', 'parts', 'down', 'pat', 'honest', 'moments', 'shares', 'Ray', 'Roma', 'best', 'grace', 'notes', 'film', 'should', 'get', 'lot', 'opportunities', 'do', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'as', 'long', 'have', 'basis', 'real', 'world', 'do', 'not', 'require', 'character', 'go', 'top', 'should', 'thrive', 'such', 'roles.Again', 'want', 'applaud', 'creativity', 'shown', 'end', 'film', 'Coming', 'up', 'payoff', 'end', 'film', 'difficult', 'need', 'something', 'characters', 'together', 'happy', 'ending', 'What', 'like', 'ending', 'characters', 'involved', 'ever', 'making', 'physical', 'contact', 'involving', 'least', 'half-dozen', 'key', 'plot', 'elements', 'most', 'importantly', 'having', 'song', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'hear', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'When', 'watch', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'pay', 'attention', 'how', 'music', 'set', 'up', 'auction', 'scene', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'new', 'here', 'make', 'great', 'film', 'director', 'Boaz', 'Yakin', 'made', 'quot', 'Uptown', 'Girls', 'quot', 'nicely', 'crafted', 'formula', 'film', 'more', 'meets', 'expectations']",Uptown Girls

Well, my sister saw it and she really enjoyed it, and since we have similar taste in movies I thought, ""Oh, well I'll go against the grain and give it a try."". And surprisingly, ""Uptown Girls"" was actually very good for what it is.In terms of its characters, while Ray (Dakota Fanning's character) as a child seems an unlikely character, meaning you'de rarely encounter them in real life (although I can honestly say I have met some 8yrs who had similar issues), Molly (the late Brittany Murphy's character) seems pretty damn realistic when you look at just how many ""Paris Hiltons"" there are out there.While the film itself is pretty predictable, watching the characters development and interaction through out the film is a joy and the chemistry between Murphy and Fanning is what makes the film.  Murphy played quite a few characters like this (Love and Other Disasters, Ramen Girl) while she was alive, and that's probably because she can some how be extremely annoying and yet still enjoyable to watch at the same time because she comes across as a like able person.  It is a lot of fun watching the characters go through their transformations and this movie is actually a lot deeper than you might think in terms of why the characters are the way that they are.This movie is almost a musical it has so much music and revolves around a musicians daughter and her boy friend who is a musician so we here a lot of their music and watch them perform.  Despite what some have stated I found the music in the film to be fairly endearing and catchy. . I can't get ""Sheets of Egyptain Cotton"" out of my head since I saw the movie 2days ago (10/23/10 Its now been 7yrs and I STILL get that song in my head every time I see or hear of Egyptian cotton sheets).If you don't mind predictable movies that are fun, but still have a message that actually sticks, then you will probably enjoy ""Uptown Girls"".*Enjoy* & God Bless ~Amy",5,"Silly and Improbably, but Enjoyable.  :)",1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,2173,"['NOTE', 'Revised', 'Grammatically', 'Structurally', 'Saturday', 'October', '23', '2010.I', 'expected', 'something', 'was', 'absolutely', 'horrid', 'unwatchable', 'Uptown', 'Girls', 'bad', 'reviews', 'got', 'critics', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Well', 'sister', 'saw', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'have', 'similar', 'taste', 'movies', 'thought', 'Oh', 'well', ""'ll"", 'go', 'grain', 'give', 'try.', 'surprisingly', 'Uptown', 'Girls', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'is.In', 'terms', 'characters', 'Ray', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'character', 'child', 'unlikely', 'character', 'meaning', ""you'de"", 'rarely', 'encounter', 'real', 'life', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'have', 'met', '8yrs', 'who', 'had', 'similar', 'issues', 'Molly', 'late', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'character', 'pretty', 'damn', 'realistic', 'when', 'look', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'Paris', 'Hiltons', 'are', 'out', 'film', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'watching', 'characters', 'development', 'interaction', 'film', 'joy', 'chemistry', 'Murphy', 'Fanning', 'what', 'film', 'Murphy', 'played', 'quite', 'few', 'characters', 'Love', 'Other', 'Disasters', 'Ramen', 'Girl', 'was', 'alive', 'probably', 'can', 'how', 'be', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'yet', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'same', 'time', 'across', 'like', 'able', 'person', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'characters', 'go', 'transformations', 'movie', 'actually', 'lot', 'deeper', 'might', 'think', 'terms', 'why', 'characters', 'are', 'way', 'are.This', 'movie', 'almost', 'musical', 'so', 'much', 'music', 'around', 'musicians', 'daughter', 'boy', 'friend', 'who', 'musician', 'here', 'lot', 'music', 'watch', 'perform', 'what', 'have', 'stated', 'found', 'music', 'film', 'be', 'fairly', 'endearing', 'catchy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Sheets', 'Egyptain', 'Cotton', 'head', 'saw', 'movie', '2days', 'ago', '10/23/10', 'now', 'been', '7yrs', 'STILL', 'get', 'song', 'head', 'time', 'see', 'hear', 'Egyptian', 'cotton', 'sheets', '.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'predictable', 'movies', 'are', 'fun', 'still', 'have', 'message', 'actually', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'Uptown', 'Girls', '*Enjoy*', 'God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",Uptown Girls

It was going for the warm fuzzy's and along the way found a real heart for me.Cocky and not-so-bright Britney Murphy (Just Married, 8-Mile) plays a aristocratic well to do teen who suddenly looses what she ahs to find out she needs to get a real job. In her attempt she is befriended by a mother played by Heather Locklear (Looney Toons Back In Action, The First Wives Club) who needs a caretaker - babysitter for her young daughter played by Dakota Fanning (I Am Sam, The Cat In The Hat).The two teach each other a valuable lesson about life. One - Brittany needs to lean how to grow up, the other - Dakota - needs how to learn to have fun. The two are forced to tolerate each other in order to appease the mother. However, in the process of hating each other, they learn a lesion in family friendship and that people are not what they seem to be on the outside.That's the warm fuzzy! Really nice heart - it does get a little slow in parts, but the chemistry of little Dakota with everyone on screen is amazing. You can't help not liking her even after she plays this temperamental little brat.As far as the theatrical experience, a good film for the teens and young adults but it is not really for the really young or middle aged crowd - it does have a syrupy side that may give some a tooth ache.

She acts goofy, but she's very smart.This is an OK movie, not great, but not bad either, the ending sums it all up perfectly, and redeems the movie a little better. I found Dakota Fanning's character extremely annoying, health conscious, shows signs of OCD and precocious! She gets better towards the end of the movie. (She comes across in the extras as having a very old head on young shoulders, which I suppose is to be expected in that business. You do wanna slap at times!) Also Jesse Spencer's accent, is it Australian, or is it English? (Hasn't he grown up since Billy Kennedy in Neighbours? Er, not really!) Brittany's best friends in the movie, aren't really best friends at all, and their characters are not very well developed.Brittany Murphy plays these characters very well, that she's done in most of her movies, and you can quite imagine that she doesn't have struggle, as the characters are pretty much her! One of her roles that aren't 'her' so to speak is Daisy in Girl, Interrupted. She's apparently really different in Clueless, but I've never seen that!You'd be forgiven for mistaking the fact this movie is all about a romance between Jesse's & Brittany's characters. In fact, he has very little to do with her, apart from a couple of scenes. There's a lot more to their 'relationship' that was cut, and is featured in the deleted scenes, including some dodgy looking bedroom scenes.Everything about this film screamed COMEDY. The DVD cover. The trailer (swinging door!). The leading lady. The title. The tagline 'They're about to teach each other how to act their age'. In fact, it's not, it tries to be, but it also has some serious and sad moments thrown in, that will throw you, as to what the movie is trying to be.The extras are your usual, bog standard ones, although we get an interesting look into how they got the clothes & everything, and how they avoided sticking Brittany in trousers or denim! Interesting! The rest of the extras are: deleted scenes (you find out that Brittany & Jesse's characters relationship was based purely on the S word, which Amazon won't allow me to say!); ""The Lowdown on Uptown"" - featurette; ""Rockin' Style"" - featurette; video stills gallery; and ""Time"" music video with Chantal Kreviazuk - another one hit wonder, who will never go much further than having her video and song on this DVD. I'll be very surprised anyway.This film is extremely sad, so get the tissues out for the end! As I already said the ending redeems the film, but there are plenty of tedious moments, and pointless scenes just thrown in. But it is a good film, about friendship, rather than your typical rom-com.

780029,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B0000DZ6N3,MollyRK,"[1, 1]","I saw ""Uptown Girls"" twice in the theaters and made sure I snagged the DVD this morning, one day after its release.While there are some parts of this film that I personally feel brought a little clutter and confusion to the story (the whole beginning with Brittany Murphy's character Molly and the guy she brings home, as well as Molly's quick and random loss of all her money, just did not flow the right way; maybe it's just me, though), ""Uptown Girls"" really picked up as soon as young Molly Gunn (Murphy), a spirited, youthful young party girl begins her first major job as a nanny to 8-year-old Ray Schleine (Dakota Fanning). While the two can relate to and appreciate one another in some intense ways--Molly copes with her parents' death through playful and childish behavior, while little Ray handles her parents' emotional absences through a hard, angry, and unrelenting mask--it takes time for them to grow comfortable with each other's help. Part of what helps makes the storyline so realistic is that it doesn't begin with Molly and Ray hating each other and then quickly shift them into a sappy relationship where they become the best of friends. Even as they begin getting along and opening up more to each other, many halts and challenges cloud their gradual friendship throughout the film. Molly wants to care for the child and share her youthful charm with her, but Ray is not about to let down her defenses until she knows exactly who this Molly Gunn is and what kind of influence she will have on her life.The storyline moves very slowly at parts, but the excellent acting and the faithful innocence of the plot make it a truly worthwhile film that many can enjoy.The two leading actresses work extremely well with their roles, creating in-depth characters that we can slowly but surely feel for as the movie progresses. Brittany Murphy is wonderful and has a very childlike innocence to her that made the role of Molly Gunn perfect for her. As for 9-year-old Dakota Fanning.... I absolutely cannot get over her. Every once in a great, great, great while, Hollywood releases a child who starts appearing over and over and shows signs of greatness, and Fanning is just that type of little girl. This young actress is just incredible--I was watching and listening to her in the DVD's short featurette about the making of the film (there's a priceless segment in it with Dakota imitating the paparazzi) and was just in awe. This little girl has amazing maturity, is smart as a whip, and has tremendous talent. She knows exactly what's going on around her, and she's about as ""with it"" as any of the leading adult actors out there. I just know that Dakota is going to be the next Shirley Temple--the next child phenom who will, for the rest of her life, put light in the sometimes dark world and make people feel peaceful and happy with her films. Given a few more years, Dakota is going to have the whole world noticing her--Hollywood has already made sure of this by putting her in many diverse and increasingly mature roles. She's done a little drama (I Am Sam), science fiction (Taken), children's films (Cat In the Hat), fairytale-drama (Uptown Girls), and will soon take on her biggest, most intense role yet with Denzel Washington in the action thriller ""Man On Fire."" I just love the way Hollywood is using her maturity to their advantage yet is still allowing her to maintain that hopeful, gentle, and innocent glow that can establish her as a true inspirational fixture throughout her life. They certainly are not holding back with little Dakota--she may be only nine years old, but she's not just a cute little movie child with enough talent to carry a movie or two. She's got the fire and determination to go all the way, perhaps farther than any other child star has ever gone. It sounds extreme, but that's just how good she is, and there's this amazing promise she carries that almost cannot be explained--just embraced and believed. At 18 years old, I truly admire her; I wish her all the best, and I absolutely cannot wait to see what she becomes in the future.I guess I got a little off track here, talking more about Dakota Fanning herself than the movie...but all in all, ""Uptown Girls"" is a great, sentimental story that may bring a tear or two to your eye. As determined to motivate as it is to stress the importance of sharing emotions, ""Uptown Girls"" may be a great choice if you're looking for something powerful and ultimately uplifting, topped off with some inspired acting.",5,wonderful movie--Fanning absolutely shines,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,4515,"['saw', 'Uptown', 'Girls', 'twice', 'theaters', 'made', 'sure', 'snagged', 'DVD', 'morning', 'one', 'day', 'release.While', 'are', 'parts', 'film', 'personally', 'feel', 'brought', 'little', 'clutter', 'confusion', 'story', 'whole', 'beginning', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'character', 'Molly', 'guy', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'Molly', 'quick', 'random', 'loss', 'money', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'right', 'way', 'just', 'though', 'Uptown', 'Girls', 'really', 'picked', 'up', 'as', 'soon', 'young', 'Molly', 'Gunn', 'Murphy', 'spirited', 'youthful', 'young', 'party', 'girl', 'first', 'major', 'job', 'nanny', '8-year-old', 'Ray', 'Schleine', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'two', 'can', 'relate', 'appreciate', 'one', 'intense', 'ways', 'Molly', 'parents', 'death', 'playful', 'childish', 'behavior', 'little', 'Ray', 'parents', 'emotional', 'absences', 'hard', 'angry', 'unrelenting', 'mask', 'time', 'grow', 'comfortable', 'other', 'help', 'Part', 'what', 'storyline', 'so', 'realistic', ""n't"", 'begin', 'Molly', 'Ray', 'hating', 'other', 'then', 'quickly', 'shift', 'sappy', 'relationship', 'where', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'Even', 'begin', 'getting', 'along', 'opening', 'up', 'more', 'other', 'many', 'halts', 'challenges', 'cloud', 'gradual', 'friendship', 'film', 'Molly', 'care', 'child', 'share', 'youthful', 'charm', 'Ray', 'not', 'let', 'down', 'defenses', 'exactly', 'who', 'Molly', 'Gunn', 'what', 'kind', 'influence', 'will', 'have', 'life.The', 'storyline', 'moves', 'very', 'slowly', 'parts', 'excellent', 'acting', 'faithful', 'innocence', 'plot', 'make', 'truly', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'many', 'can', 'enjoy.The', 'two', 'leading', 'actresses', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', 'roles', 'creating', 'in-depth', 'characters', 'can', 'slowly', 'surely', 'feel', 'movie', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'wonderful', 'very', 'childlike', 'innocence', 'made', 'role', 'Molly', 'Gunn', 'perfect', '9-year-old', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'absolutely', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'once', 'great', 'great', 'great', 'Hollywood', 'child', 'who', 'appearing', 'signs', 'greatness', 'Fanning', 'just', 'type', 'little', 'girl', 'young', 'actress', 'just', 'incredible', 'was', 'watching', 'listening', 'DVD', 'short', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'priceless', 'segment', 'Dakota', 'imitating', 'paparazzi', 'was', 'just', 'awe', 'little', 'girl', 'amazing', 'maturity', 'smart', 'whip', 'tremendous', 'talent', 'exactly', 'what', 'going', 'about', 'leading', 'adult', 'actors', 'out', 'there', 'just', 'know', 'Dakota', 'going', 'be', 'next', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'next', 'child', 'phenom', 'who', 'will', 'rest', 'life', 'put', 'light', 'sometimes', 'dark', 'world', 'make', 'people', 'feel', 'peaceful', 'happy', 'films', 'Given', 'few', 'more', 'years', 'Dakota', 'going', 'have', 'whole', 'world', 'noticing', 'Hollywood', 'already', 'made', 'sure', 'putting', 'many', 'diverse', 'increasingly', 'mature', 'roles', 'done', 'little', 'drama', 'Am', 'Sam', 'science', 'fiction', 'Taken', 'children', 'films', 'Cat', 'Hat', 'fairytale-drama', 'Uptown', 'Girls', 'will', 'soon', 'take', 'biggest', 'most', 'intense', 'role', 'yet', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'action', 'thriller', 'Man', 'Fire', 'just', 'love', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'using', 'maturity', 'advantage', 'yet', 'still', 'allowing', 'maintain', 'hopeful', 'gentle', 'innocent', 'glow', 'can', 'establish', 'true', 'inspirational', 'fixture', 'life', 'certainly', 'are', 'not', 'holding', 'back', 'little', 'Dakota', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'not', 'just', 'cute', 'little', 'movie', 'child', 'enough', 'talent', 'carry', 'movie', 'two', 'got', 'fire', 'determination', 'go', 'way', 'perhaps', 'farther', 'other', 'child', 'star', 'ever', 'gone', 'extreme', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'amazing', 'promise', 'almost', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'explained', 'just', 'embraced', 'believed', '18', 'years', 'old', 'truly', 'admire', 'wish', 'best', 'absolutely', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'future.I', 'guess', 'got', 'little', 'off', 'track', 'here', 'talking', 'more', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'movie', 'Uptown', 'Girls', 'great', 'sentimental', 'story', 'may', 'bring', 'tear', 'two', 'eye', 'determined', 'motivate', 'stress', 'importance', 'sharing', 'emotions', 'Uptown', 'Girls', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'choice', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'powerful', 'ultimately', 'uplifting', 'topped', 'off', 'inspired', 'acting']",Uptown Girls

780037,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B0000DZ6N3,Only-A-Child,"[3, 4]","Twenty-five years after the film ""Times Square"" we get an updated version of that New Wave classic. And like its predecessor, ""Uptown Girls"" is destined to be more appreciated twenty-five years later than it was by contemporary critics and audiences. Both films include terrific music that had people stopping at a store on the way home from the film to pick up the soundtrack album/CD (with ""soundtrack"" defined as songs by a collection of artists as compared to a more traditional musical score), both feature two emotionally fragile girls-polar opposites who bond and help each other, both have Altman's cool ""Kansas City"" twist where the seemingly weaker girl becomes protective of the tough girl, both have absolutlely perfect endings, and both take place in NYC.One major difference was that while ""Times Square"" had a clear target audience, ""Uptown Girls"" was never able to quite figure that out. While in almost every way superior to its sister film ""Raising Helen"", ""Uptown Girls"" lacks that films consistent family focus. So we have a fairy tale marketed as a comedy, a generational bonding picture with so much unnecessary adult material (a word here-an obscene gesture there) that it has a PG-13 rating. All of which means that adults think of it as a kid film and young viewers find only intermittent sequences to which they can relate.At least the film's is consistent in its inconsistency, as Boaz Yakin's inspired and imaginative direction and many incongruously subtle script elements are paired with a contrived and predictable basic story. There is originality packaged inside unoriginality-Ray is not mad at Molly because she was not there when Ray's father died or because Molly was wrong about him living longer if Ray talked to him, she is mad because Molly convinced her to lower her defenses and because of this his death hurts her more.All this disparity should work in ""Uptown Girls"" favor in a few years when the dust clears and the film finds its proper audience, one that appreciates its complex dichotomy and subtle nuances. Until then it is worth noting that this will be an important film historically. Film historians will look back on ""Uptown Girls"" as the feature where Brittany Murphy (Molly Gunn) really began to define the perceptive airhead persona she began to develop in ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"". Roger Ebert sees a lot of the divine ineptitude of Lucille Ball in Murphy with both being magnets for ""Whoops! moments. I don't see her going quite that far, more like Zasu Pitts or Katherine Hepburn. Hollywood has gone two generations without an actress with this kind of natural comic talent. She and Dakota Fanning (Ray) play off each other very well.Music is central to the story since Molly's father was a rock legend who died in a plane crash when she was a young girl and Ray's mom runs a record label. Little Molly inspired her father to write a song about her before he died called ""Molly Smiles"". She inspires her boyfriend to write the song ""Sheets of Egyptian Cotton"" but she does not want to hear her father's song. This sets up a somewhat predictable but otherwise perfect ending as you finally get to get to hear ""Molly Smiles"" at Ray's dance recital (and the film is worth watching just for this-as good an ending as ""School of Rock""). As someone commented earlier, the song works perfectly in the finale as all the plot threads are pulled together: "" (1) we get to hear ""Molly Smiles,"" (2) Neal makes up with Molly, (3) we find out what happened to Tommy Gunn's guitars, (4) Ray makes up with Molly, (5) Ray finally dances free style, (6) Ray uses some moves she learned from Molly, and (7) Ray wears Molly's designer tutu. Appropriately, The soundtrack has a lot of the songs by female artists and makes for a pleasant enough album when you finally decide to play something else besides track 12.

She can't hold onto a job, or an apartment; she can't pay her bills, yet she buys stuff she can't afford; and her latest boyfriend feels that she's smothering him.  Along the way, a friend, played by Donald Faison of Scrubs, recommends her for a job as a nanny for his employer's daughter.  The little girl, named Ray, has already gone through several nannies, and she's not interested in keeping this one.  Along the way the two women realize how close they are in personality, and how the loss of their parents effected them each in different ways.  Ray's father is in a coma from a stroke, and her mother cares more about her social life then her daughter.  Molly, on the other hand, lost both her parents in a plane crash when she was Ray's age.There's a lot to like about this movie, such as the performance of the two lead actresses, and the supporting character of Ray's mother, played by Heather Locklear.  But the storyline falters in many ways by being very formulaic.  It appears that they try to be realistic, but the story moves in a very un-realistic way.  No explanation is given to why, or how, Molly and Ray suddenly become friendly after snapping at each other five minutes before.  The movie lacks depth, and therefore, lacks a higher rating.

Also Molly has an on &amp; off fling with a upcoming rock star,who decides Molly is just not grown up enough for him,so that end's.Getting back to the movie,Molly realize's after seeing Ray's action's &amp; grown up behavior that she need's to save Ray from not learning how to be a child and growing up to fast. As this is happening Molly get's in touch with herself and learn's it's time to put away childish behavior and grow up! So in effect Ray's problem's conteract Molly's need to grow up.She start's to try &amp; unleash the hurt Ray is going through,cause of her mother buying her off and paying no attention to her &amp; Ray's father that is dying. Ray dosent know how to express her feeling's. Then a problem arise's that Molly is let go of being Ray's nanny,Molly has a heated talk with Roma,(mother),&amp; let's her know that Ray has'nt had a regular childhood,&amp; a very good mother,by saying you buy her off so you don't have to deal with her,etc,and walk's out. I can't give it away,but Molly had told Ray something that was a promise &amp; Ray believed Molly,but it did'nt work out that way.Molly finally learn's she can't get Ray out of her mind,she really feel&quot;s for her pain.Ray's dad dies,Roma is taking it just fine,almost emotionalist. Molly is at a good friend's house when she learn's Ray is missing by Roma. Thinking back to her own childhood,she remember's where she wen't when she lost her parent's, Coney Island,where she would get in the spinning tea cup ride &amp; think to be alone. Molly find's Ray right there,at coney island.Ray is sitting alone in a teacup ride,Molly get's in &amp; the ride start's,you can see in both their eye's each other's pain,&amp; Ray really lets go at Molly,hitting her and then she finally cry's &amp; hug's Molly,that part is so sad,I know I cry everytime I watch it. Finally Ray &amp; Molly get their pain out,&amp; you see a very big difference in Ray,because Molly cared enough to help this little girl who had really no one to show her to be a child or to show emotion's. Then Ray learn's from Molly how to enjoy childhood &amp; not act like a grown up,as Ray help's Molly to learn how to grow up &amp; show responsibility. They help each other with emotional wound's,of losing people they love. It even affect's Roma at the end,she seem's to understand what Molly was saying to her,just love your daughter,let her be a child and be there for her,don't buy he off,it got through to her.So a 8 yr old help's a young woman,then the young woman help's the 8 yr old.That is the moral of the movie. I bought this without even seeing it,my son said it was good and it reminded him of me.Iam glad I did,because it was a heartfilled/comedy,I think we need more movie's like this,to show moral's and the trouble's people have to remind them, they are not alone,and there are still people out there that do still care about human emotion's.I liked this movie,not because only it was good with a moral,but I can relate to Ray's character. At least rent it,then you decide.",5,&quot;Okay but nothing that great&quot;,1075507200,"01 31, 2004",2004,4526,"['movie', 'actually', 'made', 'cry', 'spot', 'also', 'had', 'funny', 'spot', 'young', 'woman', 'Molly', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'who', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'really', 'grow', 'up', 'take', 'responsibility', 'daughter', 'famous', 'rock', 'star', 'father', 'Tommy', 'Gunn', 'who', 'wife', 'passed', 'away', 'leaving', 'Molly', 'enough', 'material', 'thing', 'plenty', 'money', 'Molly', 'girl', 'who', 'like', 'spend', 'money', 'clothe', 'go', 'clubbing', 'staying', 'out', 'night', 'friend', 'partying', 'One', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'Sugar', 'amp', 'Spice', 'Ingrid', 'complete', 'opposite', 'who', 'watche', 'bill', 'very', 'conservative', 'try', 'let', 'Molly', 'know', 'time', 'take', 'responsibility', 'Molly', 'still', 'doe', 'own', 'thing', 'lose', 'everything', 'accountant', 'had', 'been', 'taking', 'money', 'time', 'Now', 'time', 'Molly', 'get', 'job', 'Ingrid', 'help', 'find', 'one', 'dosent', 'work', 'out', 'Molly', 'need', 'job', 'friend', 'help', 'out', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Iam', 'Sam', 'play', 'Ray', 'little', '8', 'yr', 'old', 'girl', 'going', '30', 'whom', 'Molly', 'met', 'club', 'waiting', 'mother', 'played', 'Heather', 'Locklear', 'Roma', 'who', 'more', 'interested', 'signing', 'Rock', 'star', 'company', 'then', 'being', 'little', 'daughter', 'Ray.Molly', 'get', 'job', 'nanny', 'Ray', 'who', 'first', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'Molly', 'free', 'spirit', 'who', 'like', 'have', 'fun', 'Ray', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'left', 'alone', 'much', 'life', 'mother', 'act', 'anadult', 'then', 'child', 'Also', 'Molly', 'amp', 'off', 'fling', 'upcoming', 'rock', 'star', 'who', 'Molly', 'just', 'not', 'grown', 'up', 'enough', ""end's.Getting"", 'back', 'movie', 'Molly', 'realize', 'seeing', 'Ray', 'action', 'amp', 'grown', 'up', 'behavior', 'need', 'save', 'Ray', 'not', 'learning', 'how', 'be', 'child', 'growing', 'up', 'fast', 'happening', 'Molly', 'get', 'touch', 'herself', 'learn', 'time', 'put', 'away', 'childish', 'behavior', 'grow', 'up', 'So', 'effect', 'Ray', 'problem', 'conteract', 'Molly', 'need', 'grow', 'up.She', 'start', 'try', 'amp', 'unleash', 'hurt', 'Ray', 'going', 'cause', 'mother', 'buying', 'off', 'paying', 'attention', 'amp', 'Ray', 'father', 'dying', 'Ray', 'dosent', 'know', 'how', 'express', 'feeling', 'Then', 'problem', 'arise', 'Molly', 'let', 'go', 'being', 'Ray', 'nanny', 'Molly', 'heated', 'talk', 'Roma', 'mother', 'amp', 'let', 'know', 'Ray', ""has'nt"", 'had', 'regular', 'childhood', 'amp', 'very', 'good', 'mother', 'saying', 'buy', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'deal', 'etc', 'walk', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'Molly', 'had', 'told', 'Ray', 'something', 'was', 'promise', 'amp', 'Ray', 'believed', 'Molly', 'work', 'out', 'way.Molly', 'finally', 'learn', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Ray', 'mind', 'really', 'feel', 'quot', 's', 'pain.Ray', 'dad', 'dies', 'Roma', 'taking', 'just', 'fine', 'almost', 'emotionalist', 'Molly', 'good', 'friend', 'house', 'when', 'learn', 'Ray', 'missing', 'Roma', 'Thinking', 'back', 'own', 'childhood', 'remember', 'where', ""n't"", 'when', 'lost', 'parent', 'Coney', 'Island', 'where', 'would', 'get', 'spinning', 'tea', 'cup', 'ride', 'amp', 'think', 'be', 'alone', 'Molly', 'find', 'Ray', 'right', 'there', 'coney', 'island.Ray', 'sitting', 'alone', 'teacup', 'ride', 'Molly', 'get', 'amp', 'ride', 'start', 'can', 'see', 'eye', 'other', 'pain', 'amp', 'Ray', 'really', 'go', 'Molly', 'hitting', 'then', 'finally', 'cry', 'amp', 'hug', 'Molly', 'part', 'so', 'sad', 'know', 'cry', 'everytime', 'watch', 'Finally', 'Ray', 'amp', 'Molly', 'get', 'pain', 'amp', 'see', 'very', 'big', 'difference', 'Ray', 'Molly', 'cared', 'enough', 'help', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'really', 'no', 'one', 'show', 'be', 'child', 'show', 'emotion', 'Then', 'Ray', 'learn', 'Molly', 'how', 'enjoy', 'childhood', 'amp', 'not', 'act', 'grown', 'up', 'Ray', 'help', 'Molly', 'learn', 'how', 'grow', 'up', 'amp', 'show', 'responsibility', 'help', 'other', 'emotional', 'wound', 'losing', 'people', 'love', 'even', 'affect', 'Roma', 'end', 'seem', 'understand', 'what', 'Molly', 'was', 'saying', 'just', 'love', 'daughter', 'let', 'be', 'child', 'be', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'off', 'got', 'her.So', '8', 'yr', 'old', 'help', 'young', 'woman', 'then', 'young', 'woman', 'help', '8', 'yr', 'moral', 'movie', 'bought', 'even', 'seeing', 'son', 'said', 'was', 'good', 'reminded', 'me.Iam', 'glad', 'did', 'was', 'heartfilled/comedy', 'think', 'need', 'more', 'movie', 'show', 'moral', 'trouble', 'people', 'have', 'remind', 'are', 'not', 'alone', 'are', 'still', 'people', 'there', 'do', 'still', 'care', 'human', ""emotion's.I"", 'liked', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'good', 'moral', 'can', 'relate', 'Ray', 'character', 'least', 'rent', 'then', 'decide']",Uptown Girls
780052,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000DZ6N3,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","Greenestreet Film receptionist Allison Jacobs thought of the original story, and developed it with other three writers to make it ""Uptown Girls.""  Clearly the genesis of the film is appealng to her, and the Brittany Murphy/Dakota Fanning duo is helpful to make it more so.  But one strange thing is the choice of the director Boaz Yakin, whose previous films are rather serious ones (""Fresh"" and ""A Price above Rubies"").The strength and weakness of ""Uptown Girls"" may be accounted for with this unique origin.  It features hopelessly clueless (NYC's) Uptown girl Molly, whose dad was a once popular rock singer.  She lives in a comfy room with so many birthday presents that she'd rather thrown them away to some charity institute as if nothing.But her life changes entirely when her financial manager ""Bob"" (just Bob) takes all the money and flies to Brazil.  She has to earn money, and her last resort is to be a babysittter for a rich 8 year-old girl, Dakota Fanning's Ray, whose mother is always away from the penthouse.  And Ray is awfully, very awfully, precocious.Can they be friends?  Can they understand each other?  Of course, you know the answer for sure, but that is not a problem at all.  The two leading ladies are charming enough in their own way, I thought, but some (or many) would take these ladies  otherwise, thinking them too obnoxious and noisy.  Frankly this is the point that divides the opinions among viewers.  If you hate Ally McBeal, you should stay away from this one.Brittany Murphy's Molly may look as if following the tradition that comes from Marilyn Monroe -- good-natured blonde girl who just cannot get everything right, but still charming.  Ms. Murphy is sexy and seductive enough to engage our attention, but I found Dakota Fanning lacks her usual charms.  She does not smile at all, and that might explain why.Director Boaz Yakin does decent job in inducing Brittany Murphy to show her delightful side, but his handling of the supports are total failure.  Molly's boyfriend by Jesse Spencer is insignificant (or I say unnecesary), and Ray's mother Heather Locklear is just reduced to a cypher.  Why didn't director concentrate more on drawing the relations between these girls, which is more engaging, than on the cursory descriptions of the supports?From the first moment we see Molly tumbles into Ray's room with a little pig in tow, this is a modern-age fairy tale.  You cannot take this film in any level of reality.  It's a fantasy, and this is how the film wants to be taken.  That's how the film was born, and how it should be taken.",3,If You Like Brittany Murphy like Me ...
