1217108,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001MFNB4Y,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","The restaurant has a 20% off special for old people from 2 to 4pm. The staff gets busy serving the customers. There is a snotty greeter / hostess, Naomi. When the special is over, all the old people file out. Naomi and our hero manager Dennis wave good bye to the cusomters. Naomi says ""Die Die..... die..... die, die.... die..."" instead of bye. It's the funniest joke in the movie.Yeah, no, this one should have never really been made. The Waiting was good because of Van Wilder - Ryan Reynolds, Dane Cook, the oh so hot Anna Ferris, and the chemistry between the cast. The nasty things they did to the food, the stupid jokes that were funny, that made that film funny and watchable. Sadly, this version just lacks any chemistry, no stupid good humor.The new actors try to immitate the same characters from the original, and it just doesn't work. The whole competition between a Hooters (TA TA's) and a Bennigans is just not terribly interesting or funny. Adam Corolla makes a cameo in an self help video.Oddly, the film is well made. The camera work is good. The sound recording was clear. The shots were in focus. The editing was decent, nice pacing. The film length was just about right. It's just too bad the acting and script weren't better.The DVD is strange. I've never seen so many previews in my life. There must be an hour of previews. There are deleted scenes bonus features.Definately rated R, for every reason except there is no violence in this film. Alanna Ubach, the horrible Naomi hostess, probably refused to take off her top for a certain scene. It's just pitiful when they use a body double and then make it so obvious. Naomi's top off is the only nudity. Definately not a film for younger viewers.Pass on this one, get the first episode, Waiting. If by some wild chance you happen to survive viewing this film all the way to the end, there is a great easter egg after all the credits have run through. Early in the film, Joshua has a nightmare about having trouble serving people and ending up naked in front of everyone at the restaurant. The nightmare montage at the end of the film is much more pleasant.",2,Blech,1241740800,"05 8, 2009",2009,2129,"['restaurant', '20', '%', 'special', 'old', 'people', '2', '4pm', 'staff', 'busy', 'serving', 'customers', 'snotty', 'greeter', '/', 'hostess', 'Naomi', 'When', 'special', 'old', 'people', 'file', 'out', 'Naomi', 'hero', 'manager', 'Dennis', 'wave', 'good', 'bye', 'cusomters', 'Naomi', 'Die', 'Die', '..', 'die', '..', 'die', 'die', 'die', 'instead', 'bye', 'funniest', 'joke', 'movie.Yeah', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'made', 'Waiting', 'was', 'good', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Dane', 'Cook', 'oh', 'so', 'hot', 'Anna', 'Ferris', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'nasty', 'things', 'did', 'food', 'stupid', 'jokes', 'were', 'funny', 'made', 'film', 'funny', 'watchable', 'Sadly', 'version', 'just', 'chemistry', 'stupid', 'good', 'humor.The', 'new', 'actors', 'try', 'immitate', 'same', 'characters', 'original', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'whole', 'competition', 'Hooters', 'TA', 'TA', 'Bennigans', 'just', 'not', 'terribly', 'interesting', 'funny', 'Adam', 'Corolla', 'cameo', 'self', 'help', 'video.Oddly', 'film', 'well', 'made', 'camera', 'work', 'good', 'sound', 'recording', 'was', 'clear', 'shots', 'were', 'focus', 'editing', 'was', 'decent', 'nice', 'pacing', 'film', 'length', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'right', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'acting', 'script', 'were', ""n't"", 'better.The', 'DVD', 'strange', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'previews', 'life', 'must', 'be', 'hour', 'previews', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'bonus', 'features.Definately', 'rated', 'R', 'reason', 'violence', 'film', 'Alanna', 'Ubach', 'horrible', 'Naomi', 'hostess', 'probably', 'refused', 'take', 'off', 'top', 'certain', 'scene', 'just', 'pitiful', 'when', 'use', 'body', 'double', 'then', 'make', 'so', 'obvious', 'Naomi', 'top', 'off', 'only', 'nudity', 'Definately', 'not', 'film', 'younger', 'viewers.Pass', 'one', 'get', 'first', 'episode', 'Waiting', 'wild', 'chance', 'happen', 'survive', 'viewing', 'film', 'way', 'end', 'great', 'easter', 'egg', 'credits', 'have', 'run', 'Early', 'film', 'Joshua', 'nightmare', 'having', 'trouble', 'serving', 'people', 'ending', 'up', 'naked', 'front', 'everyone', 'restaurant', 'nightmare', 'montage', 'end', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'pleasant']",Still Waiting... waiting 2

Did the constant food tampering simultaneously abuse your abdomen by causing you to bust a gut laughing while getting sick to your stomach?  If you answered yes to any of the above, you'll love Still Waiting.Basically, most of the characters (minus Anna Faris) returned for the raunchy sequel, and thankfully Ryan Reynolds was dumped for someone a little less Ken doll, and a little more Stiffler.  If there's going to be an entire movie of genitalia jokes, food terrorism, and sexual innuendo, then why try to pretty it up?The new store manager, Dennis (Higgins), has to reach his sales quotas to be considered for district manager, and he's presently in a real bind.  With his superiors breathing down his neck, he's forced to compete with a Hooters-themed restaurant next door named Ta-Ta's that has stolen his best waitresses, and is referred to as a ""Gateway Job"" towards a stripper pole.  Prodded by an aggressive womanizing manager, Calvin (Benedict)- who has made a complete 180 from the original - and d@#k-showing game originator Raddimus (Luis Guzman), who tries to start a new game with the girls, Ta-Ta's is making Dennis' goal impossible.Naomi (Ubach) is still as vulgar as ever (but has exquisite breasts); Nick (Milonakis) is still a fat wannabe; Bishop (McBride) still manages to dish out unsolicited, unorthodox, sage advice; Dan (David Koechner) is still hilarious as the pathetic manager who wants to fit in; and the number of hot women increases exponentially from the original.  With a few surprise cameos and enough new jokes to bring about guffaws (look out for the handful of sour cream), it's not as hilarious as the original, but it's still lowbrow funny at several moments.

Dennis (played by John Michael Higgins) is the store manager for Shenaniganz and is told by his boss Dan (David Koechner) that if he doesn't raise $9,000 by the end of the day, he'll be passed up for a big promotion he's looking forward to. That won't be an easy task as the hot new restaurant in town, Ta-Ta's Wing Shack, has taken a sizable amount of Shenaniganz's business; not to mention their employees as Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict), Raddimus (Luis Guzman), and Theo (Max Kasch) defected to Ta-Ta's from Shenaniganz. Gone are most of the familiar faces except for Naomi (Alanna Ubach) and Nick (Andy Milonakis); now they've been replaced by an all-new waitstaff, bar staff, and kitchen staff. Dennis tries his best to motivate the staff to raise the money while Calvin's enjoying life; transforming from a neurotic waiter into a restaurant manager who's a ladies man. Will his transition last? Will Dennis and the waitstaff raise the money necessary for him to get the promotion? Justin Long has a cameo as Dean, Chi McBride has a cameo as Bishop, and Adam Carolla appears as Ken Halsband, motivational guru.While direct-to-DVD movies aren't necessarily critically-acclaimed, I was really disappointed with how little of the previous movie's legacy this retains. Some of the jokes in the film called back to the first Waiting... film, but then just fumbled the joke or weakly carried it out. While some of the characters improved, most actually devolved since the last film (most notably Justin Long's character) and just left the film to be carried by weak jokes, weak developments, and a not-ready-for-prime time cast that seemed like weak substitutes for the cast of the original film.It wasn't the worst film I've ever seen and there were a few laugh-out-loud moments, but there were too many inconsistencies for me to give it a higher mark.

They're competing with a Hooters-like neighboring restuarant (run by a returning Rob Benedict as Calvin, who has since transformed quite a bit since the first film), and the usual bit of gross-out antics ensue, even though they're definitely not quite as funny as they were the last time around.  More familiar faces are around as well, including Luis Guzman, Chi McBride, David Koechner, Andy Milonakis, and cameos from Justin Long and Vanessa Lengies.  All things considered, Still Waiting could have been much worse, but it manages to coax enough laughs and have enough of McKittrick's musings to make it a worthy enough sequel.",3,Not as bad as you may think,1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,1098,"['direct', 'DVD', 'sequel', 'Rob', 'McKittrick', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Waiting', 'may', 'not', 'feature', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'decently', 'funny', 'gross-out', 'sequel', 'retain', 'spirit', 'original', 'McKittrick', 'only', 'writing', 'producing', 'time', 'around', 'John', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'starring', 'Shenanigansmanager', 'looking', 'move', 'up', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'joined', 'Steve', 'Howey', 'racist', 'sex', 'hound', 'returning', 'Alanna', 'Ubach', 'as', 'well', ""'re"", 'competing', 'Hooters-like', 'neighboring', 'restuarant', 'run', 'returning', 'Rob', 'Benedict', 'Calvin', 'who', 'transformed', 'quite', 'bit', 'first', 'film', 'usual', 'bit', 'gross-out', 'antics', 'ensue', 'even', ""'re"", 'definitely', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'funny', 'were', 'last', 'time', 'around', 'More', 'familiar', 'are', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Andy', 'Milonakis', 'cameos', 'Justin', 'Long', 'Vanessa', 'Lengies', 'things', 'considered', 'Still', 'Waiting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'worse', 'coax', 'enough', 'laughs', 'have', 'enough', 'McKittrick', 'musings', 'make', 'worthy', 'enough', 'sequel']",Still Waiting... waiting 2

The first flick Waiting was very good, funny & witty even though it had no plot it worked very well with the funny bone. The original actors in Waiting had the chemistry to play off of one another & delivered the laughs. Still Waiting just was plain flat & boring. Even with some of the original cast members that were in Still Waiting, they did not strike any chemistry with its fellow actors. It would have been nice to continue the original cast at Shenaniganz instead of at the Ta Ta's restaurant.
