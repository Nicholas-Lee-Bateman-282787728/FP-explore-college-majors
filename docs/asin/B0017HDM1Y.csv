I'm not sure why this film received so many negative reviews...it wasn't the greatest film every made, but it sure was fresh and fun to watch.

1156872,A35YBNS37JJ5AV,B0017HDM1Y,Daniel J. Fiebiger,"[3, 3]","The people who don't like this movie apparently weren't paying attention, cuz it's a reasonably good story, decent enough EFX, competent acting, and has a good action hook at both the beginning and the end.  Yeah, it's a lower budget flick, but they did fine with that, cuz I've seen so much Sci-Fi for the past 6 decades and there's a LOT of movies FAR worse than this.  Pacing gets a bit slow in the middle, and the Scottish brogue takes a wee bit of getting used to, but those little problems don't last too long at 80 minutes.  Mormons and Jehovah Witnesses should avoid it, but Craig Ferguson should love it cuz they cuss a blue-steak in parts of it.  Give it chance with an alert open mind (and maybe a good beer) and you'll find something to like.

The story was completely un-dramatic though it tried to open with a dramatic fight scene between a space cruiser and some unbelievable foe's. The effects were ""home grown"" I would guess. Perhaps generated on a laptop while mass quantities of alcohol were ingested. Then, the moment the fiery villain was revealed, I literally burst into laughter.The captain of the ship was named Captain Morgan. This was appropriate because I believe a gallon of rum is what it would take to enjoy this movie, flat on my face and unconscious (don't drink and drive a space cruiser, by the way)Now, would I recommend buying this movie? Not on your life! I rented it from ""Red Box"" for one dollar and feel gypped! At the end of the movie, I looked at my wife and we both simultaneously burst into laughter again.After all of that, now that I think about it, please rent this film just to see what I am talking about. You would NEVER understand unless you saw it for yourself.

In terms of entertaining me, it did slightly better even than Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, and even better than the most recent Narnia Installment, Prince Caspian.It had major problems, some acting errors, disjointed plot. But the special effects weren't bad for an indie sci-fi, and was a creative premise (much like Pitch Black).Again, not great - but I would much rather small films like this get attention, and the directing/writing skills of new indie artists get developed, than continue to see the same old hundred-million-dollor formula films get recycled by Hollywood year after year.I give it 3.5 stars.",4,"It gets major points for creativity, indie low-budget film",1218672000,"08 14, 2008",2008,824,"['bad', 'reviews', 'just', 'had', 'see', 'film', 'learned', 'had', '13,000', 'budget.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'better', 'LOT', 'big', 'budged', 'Hollywood', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'terms', 'entertaining', 'did', 'slightly', 'better', 'even', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'even', 'better', 'most', 'recent', 'Narnia', 'Installment', 'Prince', 'Caspian.It', 'had', 'major', 'problems', 'acting', 'errors', 'disjointed', 'plot', 'special', 'effects', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'indie', 'sci-fi', 'was', 'creative', 'premise', 'much', 'Pitch', 'Black', '.Again', 'not', 'great', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'small', 'films', 'get', 'attention', 'directing/writing', 'skills', 'new', 'indie', 'artists', 'get', 'developed', 'continue', 'see', 'same', 'old', 'hundred-million-dollor', 'formula', 'films', 'get', 'recycled', 'Hollywood', 'year', 'year.I', 'give', '3.5', 'stars']",The Planet
