For $10, you only get 8 cartoons, but for someone like myself who is a Donald Duck fan, it's nice to watch this whenever I need a good laugh.  Today's cartoons are much too violent.  It's nice to see something clean.",4,Good for the price,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,315,"['too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'holidays', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'grab-bag', 'gift', '10', 'only', 'get', '8', 'cartoons', 'someone', 'myself', 'who', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'fan', 'nice', 'watch', 'whenever', 'need', 'good', 'laugh', 'Today', 'cartoons', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'violent', 'nice', 'see', 'something', 'clean']","Classic Cartoon Favorites, Vol. 2 - Starring Donald"

870235,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0006J288W,Tim Janson,"[59, 60]","This DVD includes 8 Donald Duck shorts. However, all but two of these: Inferior Decorators and Bee at the Beach are already included on the Chronological Donald Volume 1 Disney Treasures Set.  I guess that Disney is just trying to get something out that's a little less costly but you can get the Treasures Sets for around $25 to $30 and get so much more.  The Donald set comes with 36 shorts AND bonus features, so you are getting much more bang for your buck.This collection is a rather broad range of tunes from 1937 up to 1950.  Donald's Vacation and Don Donald are probably the two best shorts on the disc.  None are really classics but they are all pretty good.  I'd still say spend the extra bucks and get the Chronological Donald volume 1 if you are REALLY a Donald fan.Inferior Decorator 1948 - Spike the Bee doesn't understand why he can't get pollen out of Donald's new flowered wallpaper.Don Donald 1937 - Don Donald rides over to Donna's place on a donkey that drives him nuts. He entertains Donna (later known as Daisy); until she hops on to the donkey for a little ride and gets thrown off it's back into a fountain.Golden Eggs 1941 - With the price of eggs are going up, Donald decides to sell his hen's eggs and get rich but  ends up having a hard time harvesting eggs from the henhouse, so he goes in disguise as a rooster to get them.Bee at the Beach 1950 - Donald and Spike the Bee in another conflict, this time a fight over limited space at the beach.Donalds Dog Laundry - 1940 - Donald Duck builds an automated dog washer he dubs the ""Modern Dog Washer"". A handy Pluto naps nearby, so Donald decides to use him as his test subjectDonald's Vacation 1940 - Donald decides to go kayaking in the great outdoors. But when he gets there, he finds the animals of the forest are less than co-operative.Old Macdonald Duck 1941 - Donald enjoys a day on his farm in his version of the classic children's songChef Donald 1941 - Donald decides to try cooking along with a radio show. He tries to make waffles, but accidentally spills some rubber cement into the batter.",4,GOOD BUT GET THE TREASURES INSTEAD,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",2005,2079,"['DVD', '8', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'shorts', 'However', 'two', 'Inferior', 'Decorators', 'Bee', 'Beach', 'are', 'already', 'included', 'Chronological', 'Donald', 'Volume', '1', 'Disney', 'Treasures', 'Set', 'guess', 'Disney', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'something', 'out', 'little', 'less', 'costly', 'can', 'get', 'Treasures', 'Sets', '25', '30', 'get', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Donald', 'set', '36', 'shorts', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'getting', 'much', 'more', 'bang', 'buck.This', 'collection', 'rather', 'broad', 'range', 'tunes', '1937', '1950', 'Donald', 'Vacation', 'Don', 'Donald', 'are', 'probably', 'two', 'best', 'shorts', 'disc', 'None', 'are', 'really', 'classics', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', ""'d"", 'still', 'say', 'spend', 'extra', 'bucks', 'get', 'Chronological', 'Donald', 'volume', '1', 'are', 'REALLY', 'Donald', 'fan.Inferior', 'Decorator', '1948', 'Bee', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'pollen', 'Donald', 'new', 'flowered', 'wallpaper.Don', 'Donald', '1937', 'Don', 'Donald', 'Donna', 'place', 'donkey', 'nuts', 'Donna', 'later', 'known', 'Daisy', 'donkey', 'little', 'ride', 'thrown', 'back', 'fountain.Golden', 'Eggs', '1941', 'price', 'eggs', 'are', 'going', 'up', 'Donald', 'sell', 'hen', 'eggs', 'get', 'rich', 'up', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'harvesting', 'eggs', 'henhouse', 'disguise', 'rooster', 'get', 'them.Bee', 'Beach', '1950', 'Donald', 'Spike', 'Bee', 'conflict', 'time', 'fight', 'limited', 'space', 'beach.Donalds', 'Dog', 'Laundry', '1940', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'automated', 'dog', 'washer', 'Modern', 'Dog', 'Washer', 'handy', 'Pluto', 'naps', 'nearby', 'so', 'Donald', 'use', 'test', 'subjectDonald', 'Vacation', '1940', 'Donald', 'go', 'kayaking', 'great', 'outdoors', 'when', 'there', 'animals', 'forest', 'are', 'less', 'co-operative.Old', 'Macdonald', 'Duck', '1941', 'Donald', 'day', 'farm', 'version', 'classic', 'children', 'songChef', 'Donald', '1941', 'Donald', 'try', 'cooking', 'along', 'radio', 'show', 'make', 'waffles', 'accidentally', 'rubber', 'cement', 'batter']","Classic Cartoon Favorites, Vol. 2 - Starring Donald"
