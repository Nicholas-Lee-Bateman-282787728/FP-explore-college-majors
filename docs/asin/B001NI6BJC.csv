1220086,AQ0YEZRAW0RFN,B001NI6BJC,Galo Romero,"[3, 3]","My all-time favorite Benigni film: a veritable masterpiece: Written, Directed, Produced and Starring Roberto Benigni, who delivers a tour de force performance in a comedic style reminiscent of the greats Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, but is in no way copy-catting, but instead paying tribute to his obvious influences. Benigni's comedic timing is brilliant; the gags are whimsical, zany, and hilarious, and the story, although somewhat far-fetched, never-the-less works in the manner in which it is presented. In a nutshell, Roberto Benigni plays Loris, an opportunist and harmless shyster, who is mistaken for a serial rapist/killer. Nicoletta Braschi  (Benigni's real life wife) plays an attractive undercover police officer assigned to bring-in the notorious fiend, by using her sexuality and charms to bait and lure the sicko before he strikes again. I only wish an Art House would do a revival and present this on the big screen so I could die laughing.",5,A sex fiend is loose upon Rome...,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,963,"['all-time', 'favorite', 'Benigni', 'film', 'veritable', 'masterpiece', 'Written', 'Directed', 'Produced', 'Starring', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'who', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'performance', 'comedic', 'style', 'reminiscent', 'greats', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'way', 'copy-catting', 'instead', 'paying', 'tribute', 'obvious', 'influences', 'Benigni', 'comedic', 'timing', 'brilliant', 'gags', 'are', 'whimsical', 'zany', 'hilarious', 'story', 'somewhat', 'far-fetched', 'never-the-less', 'works', 'manner', 'presented', 'nutshell', 'Roberto', 'Benigni', 'Loris', 'opportunist', 'harmless', 'shyster', 'who', 'mistaken', 'serial', 'rapist/killer', 'Nicoletta', 'Braschi', 'Benigni', 'real', 'life', 'wife', 'attractive', 'undercover', 'police', 'officer', 'assigned', 'bring-in', 'notorious', 'fiend', 'using', 'sexuality', 'charms', 'bait', 'lure', 'sicko', 'again', 'only', 'wish', 'Art', 'House', 'would', 'do', 'revival', 'present', 'big', 'screen', 'could', 'die', 'laughing']",N/A
1220087,A2XRZV63X79YSJ,B001NI6BJC,"Movie Mania ""DVD Collector""","[0, 0]","Roberto Benigni is an Italian national comedy treasure.  When this film came out it had little fanfare in Amrerica because it is a minor comedy classic.  But after his success in Life is Beautiful, this was rereleased.  This shows the comedy genius of Roberto and once again costars his wife Nicolettta Braschi.The plot is Roberto is mistaken for a serial rapist and police officer Nicoletta is sent to get the evidence on him.  Most of the plot is there to set up the great physical comedy.  My favorite is when he is leaving his apartment and to avoid the concierge, he squats and walks under the window but he is noticed by a neighbor each time and continues to walk this way even after he leaves the building to convince the neighbor that is how he walks.  It is even funnier when he gets Nicoletta to do it too.This is for people who like Benigni's brand of comedy and it is all out comedy.One thing for people who buy this import, it is a Korean import and when you put it in it defaults to English dub and no subtitles.  If yoiu are like me, you need to go to Set Up and change to Italian with English subtitles.  Little inconvience to own this film which at this time is not available in the US.",4,Benigni and Braschi are at it again.,1397606400,"04 16, 2014",2014,1203,"['Roberto', 'Benigni', 'Italian', 'national', 'comedy', 'treasure', 'When', 'film', 'came', 'had', 'little', 'fanfare', 'Amrerica', 'minor', 'comedy', 'classic', 'success', 'Life', 'Beautiful', 'was', 'rereleased', 'comedy', 'genius', 'Roberto', 'once', 'again', 'costars', 'wife', 'Nicolettta', 'Braschi.The', 'plot', 'Roberto', 'mistaken', 'serial', 'rapist', 'police', 'officer', 'Nicoletta', 'sent', 'get', 'evidence', 'Most', 'plot', 'there', 'set', 'up', 'great', 'physical', 'comedy', 'favorite', 'when', 'leaving', 'apartment', 'avoid', 'concierge', 'walks', 'window', 'noticed', 'neighbor', 'time', 'walk', 'way', 'even', 'building', 'convince', 'neighbor', 'how', 'even', 'funnier', 'when', 'Nicoletta', 'do', 'too.This', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'Benigni', 'brand', 'comedy', 'comedy.One', 'thing', 'people', 'who', 'buy', 'import', 'Korean', 'import', 'when', 'put', 'English', 'dub', 'subtitles', 'yoiu', 'are', 'need', 'go', 'Set', 'Up', 'change', 'Italian', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Little', 'inconvience', 'own', 'film', 'time', 'not', 'available', 'US']",N/A
1220088,A24WSH1IIJSNEL,B001NI6BJC,N'awlins Native,"[8, 8]","Ya gotta love Roberto! No matter how many times I watch his films I just can't get enough. His mere presence in a scene has you on the edge of your seat just wondering how soon and for what idiocy or gaff you'll be crying with laughter over next. I took a chance on this movie due to its Korean Importation but it was as advertised. It does work here in the States on Region 1 players, there are options for English or Italian Audio and Subtitles as well. I will say this regarding the audio; I tried watching the movie using several different combinations. First I went with English Audio only and it sounded and looked as bad as an old Asian Martial-Arts movie dubbed in English. I also attempted to add English subtitles to this simultaneously. This was a total fiasco my 8 yr old could have produced. I then tried Italian audio only. Obviously this was perfect as it was filmed in his native tongue though admittedly, the editing was a tad off in some places here too lol. When I added the English Subtitles it was to me perfect. Now granted, I'm first generation Italian-American but I'm not as fluent (as I should be) in Italian. That said, I noticed a good bit of ""skewed"" translation between languages which wasn't terrible but it does unfortunately detract slightly from the heightened comedy of a few situations. Someone that doesn't understand any Italian would be none the wiser as the scenes are hilarious anyway. I just wanted to be thorough in my review as I had to read alot of them before I decided to take the plunge. Lastly, I noticed while watching this movie in a number of areas it stood out to me that Roberto and his comedic stylings are so natural to him that he doesn't even have to TRY to be funny and he succeeds at it anyway. I've seen many a comic draw laughter from an audience simply through physical gestures in the past but Roberto does it with such seemingly effortlessness and so often that he no doubt would've been the most well remembered star of the silent movie era had he been working back then.In SUMMATION... Yes this disc will play in Region 1 players, Yes it has English Audio and English Subtitles and......YES IT'S FUNNY AS HELL! :)",5,"The Italian ""Jim Carrey"" only BETTER!",1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,2180,"['Ya', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'Roberto', 'No', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'films', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'mere', 'presence', 'scene', 'edge', 'seat', 'just', 'wondering', 'how', 'soon', 'what', 'idiocy', 'gaff', ""'ll"", 'be', 'crying', 'laughter', 'next', 'took', 'chance', 'movie', 'due', 'Korean', 'Importation', 'was', 'advertised', 'work', 'here', 'States', 'Region', '1', 'players', 'are', 'options', 'English', 'Italian', 'Audio', 'Subtitles', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'say', 'regarding', 'audio', 'tried', 'watching', 'movie', 'using', 'several', 'different', 'combinations', 'First', 'went', 'English', 'Audio', 'only', 'sounded', 'looked', 'as', 'bad', 'old', 'Asian', 'Martial-Arts', 'movie', 'dubbed', 'English', 'also', 'attempted', 'add', 'English', 'subtitles', 'simultaneously', 'was', 'total', 'fiasco', '8', 'yr', 'old', 'could', 'have', 'produced', 'then', 'tried', 'Italian', 'audio', 'only', 'Obviously', 'was', 'perfect', 'was', 'filmed', 'native', 'tongue', 'admittedly', 'editing', 'was', 'tad', 'off', 'places', 'here', 'too', 'lol', 'When', 'added', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'was', 'perfect', 'Now', 'granted', ""'m"", 'first', 'generation', 'Italian-American', ""'m"", 'not', 'fluent', 'should', 'be', 'Italian', 'said', 'noticed', 'good', 'bit', 'skewed', 'translation', 'languages', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'unfortunately', 'detract', 'slightly', 'heightened', 'comedy', 'few', 'situations', 'Someone', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Italian', 'would', 'be', 'none', 'wiser', 'scenes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'anyway', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'thorough', 'review', 'had', 'read', 'alot', 'decided', 'take', 'plunge', 'Lastly', 'noticed', 'watching', 'movie', 'number', 'areas', 'stood', 'out', 'Roberto', 'comedic', 'stylings', 'are', 'so', 'natural', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'TRY', 'be', 'funny', 'anyway', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'comic', 'draw', 'laughter', 'audience', 'simply', 'physical', 'gestures', 'past', 'Roberto', 'such', 'seemingly', 'effortlessness', 'so', 'often', 'doubt', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'most', 'well', 'remembered', 'star', 'silent', 'movie', 'era', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'back', 'then.In', 'SUMMATION', 'disc', 'will', 'play', 'Region', '1', 'players', 'Yes', 'English', 'Audio', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'IT', 'FUNNY', 'AS', 'HELL']",N/A
