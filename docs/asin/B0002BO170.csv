Amazingly they become the best of friends when they encounter a situation where they have to depend upon each other for survival or die. This is an awesome movie, blending the teaching of the Indian ways from the Native American boy to the white boy, and the white boy learning many lessons of the beautiful wild nature that he learned to love and treasure. I highly recommend this movie.",5,The most unlikely Friends.....,1183680000,"07 6, 2007",2007,439,"['two', 'boys', 'are', 'entirely', 'different', 'worlds', 'Amazingly', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'when', 'encounter', 'situation', 'where', 'have', 'depend', 'other', 'survival', 'die', 'awesome', 'movie', 'blending', 'teaching', 'Indian', 'ways', 'Native', 'American', 'boy', 'white', 'boy', 'white', 'boy', 'learning', 'many', 'lessons', 'beautiful', 'wild', 'nature', 'learned', 'love', 'treasure', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie']",Lost in the Barrens
