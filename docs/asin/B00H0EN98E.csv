The movie runs a total of 88 minutes,...NOT 37 minutes as Amazon lists.  I'm pretty sure there was a short film by the same name some time ago and maybe the listing is getting that confused?  Either way, when you start watching it, it seems that it only last 37 minutes, because it's constantly keeping you interested and NEVER slows down!  Not only is this movie one ""thrill"" after the next, it's REALLY funny at times too!The movie follows Craig (Pat Healy), a family man that is about to be evicted from his apartment.  Poor Craig, he only wants the best for his wife and young child.  After being fired from his job as an ""oil change technician"", he decides to go to the local bar and have a drink before returning home.  It is there that he encounters his old high school friend, Vince (Ethan Embry).  Let me just say, I dig Ethan Embry as an actor.  I wish that he would get more staring roles.  How he manages to pull off the role of Vince, I have no idea, but he does and he is perfect as a result.As Craig and Vince begin to catch up over drinks, they meet a strange couple, Colin (David Koechner) and his wife, Violet (Sara Paxton).  This is when the movie really begins to get interesting.  After introductions, they invite Craig and Vince to play a game.  Basically, they throw down a sum of money and a challenge and the first to complete the task wins.After a few short scenes, the 4 find themselves back at one of the many homes belonging to couple.  Colin continues to challenge the guys with seemingly meaningless tasks, until Violet lays down a challenge of her own.  Craig reluctantly completes the task and makes his exit as the couple is in the other room changing clothes.This is where the movie REALLY takes it up a notch with the challenges.  I won't go any further because, well,...what would be the fun in that?!All in all, I REALLY enjoyed this movie.  It seemed to be the ideal running time.  I only hope they make a sequel!Final Verdict: RENT IT!

Unfortunately, the laughs stop once the blood starts to run, and this once funny movie becomes dull and gross.Two high school buddies run into each other at a pub. Craig (Pat Healy) is tossing them back with his former bud Vince (Ethan Embry) when their night intersects with a random couple celebrating Violet's (Sara Paxton) birthday. Her husband Colin (David Koechner) conjures up a contest to get a couple of random nobodies (Craig & Vince) to perform various stunts for cash. The pot is $250K.Most of the flick is pretty innovative, and is something like a scripted Jackass episode. Colin and Violet are excellent as a twisted rich couple out to watch other people torture themselves for money. They stage their own private minstrel show that starts with silly pranks and ends in a pool of blood. The majority of the film is excellent, and reminded me of David Lynch. The 3rd act is when everything falls apart. The gore ruins the fun, and the ending is not ironic or clever... Just sad.

1682952,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00H0EN98E,C. Sawin,"[1, 2]","&#34;Cheap Thrills&#34; seems like the type of film that makes an excuse to show the most gruesome and horrific sequences that come to mind and attempts to pass it off as entertainment, but it's actually a very well crafted black comedy thriller that sheds lights on human nature and what one individual will do when he or she faces desperation.The film is an unexpected surprise from act one, especially when it comes to the level of acting from everyone involved. Besides &#34;Piranha 3DD,&#34; this is probably the closest thing to horror David Koechner has ever done in his nearly two decade acting career. While on the surface, Colin (Koechner) just seems to be looking for a good time and a party worthy enough to satisfy his wife's birthday but there's a dark twist to Colin's behavior; a twist that isn't necessarily unforeseeable but is rather ballsy nevertheless. Meanwhile Pat Healy, who is no stranger to the characters he portrays being described as the creepy comedic relief (&#34;The Innkeepers&#34;) or smarmy and treacherous (&#34;Compliance&#34;), does a bit of a 180 in &#34;Cheap Thrills.&#34; Craig seems to be a guy who had a troubled past, but now focuses on being the husband and father that he needs to be. Scared of what awaits in an incomeless future, Craig sees a way to make ends meet until an opportunity presents himself with Colin's challenges.Ethan Embry's take on the Vince character is absorbing. Vince is basically the muscle and debt collector for some shady investor (loan shark? drug dealer?). In his own words, he's still one step away from finding himself back in prison. While he makes enough money to support himself, he needs the amount of money Colin is offering to eventually step away. Violet (Sara Paxton) is very withdrawn, but reasonably so. She's the beautiful woman who has already gotten everything she's ever wanted. So what could possibly satisfy her?When these four actors get together on-screen, something special happens. Conversations between Craig and Vince fluctuate between pure determination, utter desperation, and frightening intensity while Colin is the puppet master pulling the strings with his lovely assistant Violet doing everything she possibly can from behind the curtain.What makes &#34;Cheap Thrills&#34; so fascinating is its dissection of the human spirit. What lengths would one person go through for expendable income? Would it be any different for a large enough amount of money that could change your lifestyle? Friendships dissolve and morals are thrown out the window. All that matters is walking away with that prize money even if you find yourself doing the most humiliating or disgusting thing imaginable. Greed is certainly a factor, but providing for those you love is absolutely a part of that as well.&#34;Cheap Thrills&#34; has this dark atmosphere that is undeniably reminiscent of a horrific film like &#34;Saw,&#34; but there's more meaning behind &#34;Cheap Thrills.&#34; It's about pushing the limits of how ugly human nature can really get when it's taken to its limits. This is more like a deranged version of &#34;Fear Factor&#34; where you get rewarded for disfigurement and bloodshed yet questions how far one individual is willing to go for expendable currency. Preying on the desperate results in molding one's actions into anything anyone desires and in this case it's something sadistically meaningful. &#34;Cheap Thrills&#34; takes pride in being the devil's advocate to human desires and playing its pawns like the sweet antique ivory keys of a piano.",4,The glory of greed,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2014,3558,"['34', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', '34', 'type', 'film', 'excuse', 'show', 'most', 'gruesome', 'horrific', 'sequences', 'come', 'mind', 'attempts', 'pass', 'off', 'entertainment', 'actually', 'very', 'well', 'crafted', 'black', 'comedy', 'thriller', 'lights', 'human', 'nature', 'what', 'one', 'individual', 'will', 'do', 'when', 'desperation.The', 'film', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'act', 'one', 'especially', 'when', 'level', 'acting', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Besides', '34', 'Piranha', '3DD', '34', 'probably', 'closest', 'thing', 'horror', 'David', 'Koechner', 'ever', 'done', 'nearly', 'two', 'decade', 'acting', 'career', 'surface', 'Colin', 'Koechner', 'just', 'be', 'looking', 'good', 'time', 'party', 'worthy', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'wife', 'birthday', 'dark', 'twist', 'Colin', 'behavior', 'twist', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'unforeseeable', 'rather', 'ballsy', 'nevertheless', 'Meanwhile', 'Pat', 'Healy', 'who', 'stranger', 'characters', 'being', 'described', 'creepy', 'comedic', 'relief', '34', 'Innkeepers', '34', 'smarmy', 'treacherous', '34', 'Compliance', '34', 'bit', '180', '34', 'Cheap', 'Thrills.', '34', 'Craig', 'be', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'troubled', 'past', 'now', 'being', 'husband', 'father', 'be', 'Scared', 'what', 'incomeless', 'future', 'Craig', 'way', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'opportunity', 'Colin', 'challenges.Ethan', 'Embry', 'take', 'Vince', 'character', 'absorbing', 'Vince', 'basically', 'muscle', 'debt', 'collector', 'shady', 'investor', 'loan', 'shark', 'drug', 'dealer', 'own', 'words', 'still', 'one', 'step', 'away', 'finding', 'back', 'prison', 'enough', 'money', 'support', 'amount', 'money', 'Colin', 'offering', 'eventually', 'step', 'away', 'Violet', 'Sara', 'Paxton', 'very', 'withdrawn', 'reasonably', 'so', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'already', 'gotten', 'everything', 'ever', 'wanted', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'satisfy', 'When', 'four', 'actors', 'get', 'together', 'on-screen', 'something', 'special', 'happens', 'Conversations', 'Craig', 'Vince', 'fluctuate', 'pure', 'determination', 'utter', 'desperation', 'frightening', 'intensity', 'Colin', 'puppet', 'master', 'pulling', 'strings', 'lovely', 'assistant', 'Violet', 'doing', 'everything', 'possibly', 'can', 'curtain.What', '34', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', '34', 'so', 'fascinating', 'dissection', 'human', 'spirit', 'What', 'lengths', 'would', 'one', 'person', 'go', 'expendable', 'income', 'Would', 'be', 'different', 'large', 'enough', 'amount', 'money', 'could', 'change', 'lifestyle', 'Friendships', 'dissolve', 'morals', 'are', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'matters', 'walking', 'away', 'prize', 'money', 'even', 'find', 'doing', 'most', 'humiliating', 'disgusting', 'thing', 'imaginable', 'Greed', 'certainly', 'factor', 'providing', 'love', 'absolutely', 'part', 'well.', '34', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', '34', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'undeniably', 'reminiscent', 'horrific', 'film', '34', 'Saw', '34', 'more', 'meaning', '34', 'Cheap', 'Thrills.', '34', 'pushing', 'limits', 'how', 'ugly', 'human', 'nature', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'when', 'taken', 'limits', 'more', 'deranged', 'version', '34', 'Fear', 'Factor', '34', 'where', 'get', 'rewarded', 'disfigurement', 'bloodshed', 'yet', 'questions', 'how', 'far', 'one', 'individual', 'willing', 'go', 'expendable', 'currency', 'Preying', 'desperate', 'results', 'molding', 'one', 'actions', 'anything', 'anyone', 'desires', 'case', 'something', 'sadistically', 'meaningful', '34', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', '34', 'pride', 'being', 'devil', 'advocate', 'human', 'desires', 'playing', 'pawns', 'sweet', 'antique', 'ivory', 'keys', 'piano']",Cheap Thrills *

1682956,A3JWR2O1MZ7VNE,B00H0EN98E,Elizabeth Renee Blue,"[1, 2]","When I first added this to my watchlist, I kept putting it off because the synopsis reminded me of 3 movies I had recently seen or could still clearly remember: 13 Sins, the original Thai one: 13: Game of Death, and Would You Rather. Eventually, I got to it. Its a different experience than any of those. First, there's little mystery or conspiracy, as in the first 2 I mentioned. Compared to the latter, WYR, this one feels a bit more serious. WYR had a very strong tongue in cheeky like flavor in its execution. It teetered on campy in its look, not so much the plot. Cheap Thrills started out feeling pretty real. When the antagonists showed up, they were a little over the top but I quickly grew accustomed to them and that slightly garish touch they brought faded. Watching the competitiveness unfold between the 2 protagonists/friends was very interesting. I had a sense where it might be heading but I didn't feel like it was telegraphed. When the climactic moment arrived, it took me by surprise. I also like the subtext it raises, about calculating the value of a life. In many horror, and not horror flicks, when a sacrifice is called for in order for others to live, most often the folks who reproduced claim privilege and then present a rational argument as to why that should rightly be so. This despite the greatest threat to a sustainable planet, and life for any, being overpopulation. This argument comes up so often and sounds so similar across movies, shows, etc. that I can't help but believe it reflects a larger culturally sanctioned belief. In my eyes, an individual's life is the most valuable thing they possess, as any other thing of value is dependent on it. Once you're dead, there is nothing to be valued. Its done. While anyone can and should feel that their life (or someone they love's life) is more valuable than another's life (a neutral person), its a completely different thing to expect that individual to agree with you, that your life is inherently more valuable than theirs (for whatever reason). That's just crazy. A similar argument comes up here, to justify one's behavior towards another. The ending really brings the hypocrisy front and center and makes you think (I hope).",4,Horror Junkie's Review: Glad I finally watched it.

In the movie &#8220;Cheap Thrills&#8221; the boundaries of the saying is explored to it&#8217;s full extent. Fair warning to moviegoers - this film is not for the squeamish.When Craig (Pat Healy) is having his worst day ever, a drink before going home to his wife seems to be just the answer. A long lost friend, played by Ethan Embry, shows up and after a few more drinks they reminisce and ponder Craig&#8217;s money woes. Then the duo meets a wealthy, but, unusual couple with money to burn. The husband likes making crazy cash bets on seemingly harmless pranks.After bar hopping while playing pranks on waitresses, patrons and strippers, the craziness brings a bloody punch in the nose to Craig. Encouraged by the hundreds of dollars offered by the wealthy couple, played by David Koechner and Sara Paxton, Craig and Vince hope the nights activities will garner easy money. The cash prizes grow larger as increasingly difficult tasks make you wonder how badly either man needs money.What transpires is sort of a combination of &#8220;The Hangover&#8221; and &#8220;Saw&#8221;. A dark comedy with a message. Not really what I expected, but still, lots of thrills and jaw dropping action.

The next eighty minutes will leave you debating if this is in fact the worst thing that happens to him on that day.Because, before going home to face his family, Craig stops by a bar to get a few shots in him, and that's where he runs into an old high school pal he hasn't seen in years, the whiskery, slightly-off Vince. After catching up on old times, the old friends then meet the acquaintance of Colin and Violet, a married couple that -- it appears -- is rich beyond comprehension. It's Violet's birthday, and to celebrate, they've taken to the town with a ton of cash and a gambling compulsion that is imaginative and all-encompassing. $50 to the first man to take a shot of tequila. $100 to the first guy to get a woman to slap him in the face. Slap that stripper's butt? $200.The movie bills itself as a dark comedy, but there's not a whole lot of humor here. I don't count that against the film, which turns out to be a richly disturbing portrayal of human psychology and sociology as the bets get more expensive and more dangerous. It's not just about what a man is willing to do to provide for his family, but it's also about how the degradation is amplified by the competition between the two old friends who, it may turn out, don't know each other as well as they used to.Remarkably simple as a script and plot, the real meat here lies in the almost masterful subtlety of the performances, not just from our lead (Pat Healy), but especially from David Koechner, a seasoned comedic actor whose nuanced portrayal of Colin makes him seem both warm and evil at the same time. Carried on the shoulders of these two performers, the film -- in spite of its no-frills approach to story-telling -- gains a lasting complexity that will resonate as much as disturb, even to the last frame. And although the tale itself isn't all that unique (inspired by everything fromFunny GamestoTrading Places), it is told with such unassuming and unpretentious confidence that it puts no filters between its very dark truths and the audience, making it a movie that will stick with you long after the last drop of blood is shed.",5,Caveat Emptor,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,2239,"['first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'husband', 'young', 'father', 'Craig', 'served', 'eviction', 'notice', 'pink', 'slip', 'next', 'eighty', 'minutes', 'will', 'leave', 'debating', 'fact', 'worst', 'thing', 'day.Because', 'going', 'home', 'face', 'family', 'Craig', 'bar', 'get', 'few', 'shots', 'where', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'pal', ""n't"", 'seen', 'years', 'whiskery', 'slightly-off', 'Vince', 'catching', 'up', 'old', 'times', 'old', 'friends', 'then', 'meet', 'acquaintance', 'Colin', 'Violet', 'married', 'couple', 'rich', 'comprehension', 'Violet', 'birthday', 'celebrate', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'town', 'ton', 'cash', 'gambling', 'compulsion', 'imaginative', 'all-encompassing', '50', 'first', 'man', 'take', 'shot', 'tequila', '100', 'first', 'guy', 'get', 'woman', 'slap', 'face', 'Slap', 'stripper', 'butt', '200.The', 'movie', 'bills', 'dark', 'comedy', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'humor', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'richly', 'disturbing', 'portrayal', 'human', 'psychology', 'sociology', 'bets', 'get', 'more', 'expensive', 'more', 'dangerous', 'not', 'just', 'what', 'man', 'willing', 'do', 'provide', 'family', 'also', 'how', 'degradation', 'amplified', 'competition', 'two', 'old', 'friends', 'who', 'may', 'turn', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'used', 'to.Remarkably', 'simple', 'script', 'plot', 'real', 'meat', 'here', 'almost', 'masterful', 'subtlety', 'performances', 'not', 'just', 'lead', 'Pat', 'Healy', 'especially', 'David', 'Koechner', 'seasoned', 'comedic', 'actor', 'nuanced', 'portrayal', 'Colin', 'seem', 'warm', 'evil', 'same', 'time', 'Carried', 'shoulders', 'two', 'performers', 'film', 'spite', 'no-frills', 'approach', 'story-telling', 'gains', 'lasting', 'complexity', 'will', 'resonate', 'as', 'much', 'disturb', 'even', 'last', 'frame', 'tale', ""n't"", 'unique', 'inspired', 'everything', 'fromFunny', 'GamestoTrading', 'Places', 'told', 'such', 'unassuming', 'unpretentious', 'confidence', 'filters', 'very', 'dark', 'truths', 'audience', 'making', 'movie', 'will', 'stick', 'long', 'last', 'drop', 'blood', 'shed']",Cheap Thrills *

Zwick,"[3, 3]","An allegory of sorts for the Occupy generation, &#8220;Cheap Thrills&#8221; endeavors to answer the age-old question of just how far you would be willing to go for a boatload of cash. Especially when you&#8217;ve just lost your job, you&#8217;re being evicted from your home, and you have a wife and toddler counting on you for support. This is the dilemma facing Craig (Pat Healy), an Average-Joe, mild-mannered urbanite who&#8217;s genuinely trying to play by the rules but who just keeps getting dumped on by a world that seems dead-set against him ever achieving his portion of the American Dream.On the night he loses his job as a mechanic at a Southern California garage, Craig wanders into a local bar only to hook up with an old buddy of his from childhood (Ethan Embry) and an obnoxious, borderline-sadistic millionaire (David Koechner) who keeps tossing money at the two men whenever they perform impromptu, trivial tasks for him. Things turn serious, however, when Mr. Moneybags ups the ante, throwing out ever more enticing financial rewards for ever more vile and degrading stunts.Though fairly simple and straightforward on the surface, &#8220;Cheap Thrills,&#8220; written by Trent Haaga and David Chichirillo and directed by E.L Katz, is really a modern-day parable about greed, desperation, exploitation and the dangers of unbridled macho bravado. It portrays, in miniature, a world in which a small number of people have virtually everything in terms of wealth and power, while the vast majority wind up with virtually nothing they can call their own. Craig and Vince have so little to lose, in fact, that they are willing to go to unimaginable extremes to get at least something to keep themselves from feeling like total failures in life. They sense that their very identity as men is on the line here and, thus, they will stop at nothing to assert their primacy over one another, the first step in securing that which they feel is rightfully owed to them and their families.Colin, along with his equally amoral wife, Violet (Sara Paxton), on the other hand, represents the callous 1% who amuse themselves at the expense of other people&#8217;s desperation, going so far as to pit the have-nots against one another for the sheer pleasure of watching them brawling in the dirt over the scraps that are condescendingly thrown their way. This is Darwin&#8217;s &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; as it is played out in 21st Century America.Crude, brutal, at times unwatchable even, &#8220;Cheap Thrills,&#8221; nevertheless, manages to get under the viewer&#8217;s skin, forcing him to face harsh truths about society and human nature and to ask himself just how far he would be willing to go to get what he needed to survive.  It doesn&#8217;t paint a very flattering portrait of us as a species, but, let&#8217;s face it, sometimes you don&#8217;t always like what you see when you catch a glimpse of yourself in a mirror.",4,Disturbing allegory for our modern age,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",2014,2944,"['allegory', 'sorts', 'Occupy', 'generation', '8220', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', '8221', 'endeavors', 'answer', 'age-old', 'question', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'go', 'boatload', 'cash', 'Especially', 'when', '8217', 've', 'just', 'lost', 'job', '8217', 're', 'being', 'evicted', 'home', 'have', 'wife', 'toddler', 'counting', 'support', 'dilemma', 'facing', 'Craig', 'Pat', 'Healy', 'Average-Joe', 'mild-mannered', 'urbanite', 'who', '8217', 'genuinely', 'trying', 'play', 'rules', 'who', 'just', 'getting', 'dumped', 'world', 'dead-set', 'ever', 'achieving', 'portion', 'American', 'Dream.On', 'night', 'job', 'mechanic', 'Southern', 'California', 'garage', 'Craig', 'local', 'bar', 'only', 'hook', 'up', 'old', 'buddy', 'childhood', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'obnoxious', 'borderline-sadistic', 'millionaire', 'David', 'Koechner', 'who', 'keeps', 'tossing', 'money', 'two', 'men', 'whenever', 'perform', 'impromptu', 'trivial', 'tasks', 'Things', 'turn', 'serious', 'however', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Moneybags', 'ante', 'throwing', 'out', 'ever', 'more', 'enticing', 'financial', 'rewards', 'ever', 'more', 'vile', 'degrading', 'stunts.Though', 'fairly', 'simple', 'straightforward', 'surface', '8220', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', '8220', 'written', 'Trent', 'Haaga', 'David', 'Chichirillo', 'directed', 'E.L', 'Katz', 'really', 'modern-day', 'parable', 'greed', 'desperation', 'exploitation', 'dangers', 'unbridled', 'macho', 'bravado', 'miniature', 'world', 'small', 'number', 'people', 'have', 'virtually', 'everything', 'terms', 'wealth', 'power', 'vast', 'majority', 'wind', 'up', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'can', 'call', 'own', 'Craig', 'Vince', 'have', 'so', 'little', 'lose', 'fact', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'unimaginable', 'extremes', 'get', 'least', 'something', 'keep', 'feeling', 'total', 'failures', 'life', 'sense', 'very', 'identity', 'men', 'line', 'here', 'thus', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'assert', 'primacy', 'one', 'first', 'step', 'securing', 'feel', 'rightfully', 'owed', 'families.Colin', 'equally', 'amoral', 'wife', 'Violet', 'Sara', 'Paxton', 'other', 'hand', 'callous', '1', '%', 'who', 'amuse', 'expense', 'other', 'people', '8217', 'desperation', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'pit', 'have-nots', 'one', 'sheer', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'brawling', 'dirt', 'scraps', 'are', 'condescendingly', 'thrown', 'way', 'Darwin', '8217', '8220', 'survival', 'fittest', '8221', 'played', 'out', '21st', 'Century', 'America.Crude', 'brutal', 'times', 'unwatchable', 'even', '8220', 'Cheap', 'Thrills', '8221', 'nevertheless', 'get', 'viewer', '8217', 's', 'skin', 'forcing', 'face', 'harsh', 'truths', 'society', 'human', 'nature', 'ask', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'go', 'get', 'what', 'needed', 'survive', '8217', 'paint', 'very', 'flattering', 'portrait', 'species', 'let', '8217', 'face', 'sometimes', 'don', '8217', 'always', 'what', 'see', 'when', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'mirror']",Cheap Thrills *

While drowning his sorrows he runs into high school buddy Vince (Ethan Embry) who manages to get by as a low paying collector. While at the bar they meet Colin (David Koechner) and his birthday wife Violet (Sara Paxton). Colin offers the men money for doing small embarrassing or socially unacceptable tasks. As the night progresses the money increases and the dare factor becomes more risky.On the surface, the film has about the same thrill as a home break-in/slasher film. In this case our working class men can walk out at any time, but don't due to the income potential. The film is a microcosm of capitalism where the money goes to individuals who are willing to do the worst tasks for less money, under bidding each other and even willing to commit crimes.Good job by the actors, although I would have enjoyed a Violet who was bubbly instead of a dead pan individual. While it doesn't tie into the metaphor as well, it would have been more entertaining. Maybe have Taylor Swift in the role and then have her write a song about how wonderful it was for the closing credits.Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, strippers bra/pasties.",4,YOU WILL NEVER FORGET THIS NIGHT,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,1240,"['Craig', 'Pat', 'Healy', 'new', 'baby', 'new', 'eviction', 'notice', 'last', 'twenty', 'made', 'layoff', 'list', 'work', 'drowning', 'sorrows', 'high', 'school', 'buddy', 'Vince', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'who', 'get', 'low', 'paying', 'collector', 'bar', 'meet', 'Colin', 'David', 'Koechner', 'birthday', 'wife', 'Violet', 'Sara', 'Paxton', 'Colin', 'men', 'money', 'doing', 'small', 'embarrassing', 'socially', 'unacceptable', 'tasks', 'night', 'money', 'increases', 'dare', 'factor', 'more', 'risky.On', 'surface', 'film', 'same', 'thrill', 'home', 'break-in/slasher', 'film', 'case', 'working', 'class', 'men', 'can', 'walk', 'out', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'due', 'income', 'potential', 'film', 'microcosm', 'capitalism', 'where', 'money', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'do', 'worst', 'tasks', 'less', 'money', 'bidding', 'other', 'even', 'willing', 'commit', 'crimes.Good', 'job', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Violet', 'who', 'was', 'bubbly', 'instead', 'dead', 'pan', 'individual', ""n't"", 'tie', 'metaphor', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'entertaining', 'Maybe', 'have', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'role', 'then', 'have', 'song', 'how', 'wonderful', 'was', 'closing', 'credits.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bombs', 'sex', 'strippers', 'bra/pasties']",Cheap Thrills *
