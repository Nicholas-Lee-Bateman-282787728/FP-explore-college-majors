1062874,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000O77SOK,calvinnme,"[15, 18]","This show was a fine example of successfully mixing torts with the titillating with a good balance that has eluded so many other courtroom dramas over the years. The premise of the show is that Bobby Donnell is the head of a law firm that is barely managing to keep itself financially afloat due to the kinds of cases that the firm takes and the fact that they have trouble collecting their fees from more than a few of their clients. However, these lawyers are the kind of people you would always want on your side. They have a can-do attitude and seem to relish an uphill fight. In fact, at several points in the show, they remind one another that the reason they took on the uncertainty and lesser remuneration of starting their own law firm was so that they could choose their battles rather than work for a big firm where the price of financial safety would be representing big corporate clients, right or wrong. Although this show has a large sexual component, it has several average looking and even outright plain looking folk as regular castmembers. Furthermore, these average looking people, with more than their share of physical flaws, are actually given meaningful personal lives. Creator David E. Kelley actually wrote five of the first six episodes of the first season, and it shows in the performances. Unlike many shows where the characters struggle to figure out who they are, these actors and actresses have their personalities down pat with their opening lines.Since this DVD is recreating season one of ""The Practice"" as it was originally planned, we will be missing some of the highlights of season two. First off, the romance between Bobby Donnell and Helen Gamble has a long build-up, a short duration in season two, and a long period of reprisals before the two finally become friends. These episodes will be missing from this installment. Also, Joey Heric, a flamboyent defendant who makes several appearances over the years and is excellently played by John Larroquette, will be missing from this volume. He makes his first appearance in ""Betrayal"", which is not on this set. Joey always looks embarrassingly guilty of whatever homicide he happens to be accused and has a ""I Dare You to Convict Me"" attitude.If you watched Ally McBeal, another David E. Kelley legal show also based in Boston, you'll probably notice that these two shows are sharing more than a few judges, which only makes sense if you think about it. Removing the seven episodes from volume one, that leaves 21 episodes remaining for the actual season two as it was broadcast. I hope this means future volumes of this show will end on actual season boundaries, since several seasons end with cliffhangers and busting up the seasons any further would rather ruin the continuity of it all.",5,A great legal drama finally comes to DVD,1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,2782,"['show', 'was', 'fine', 'example', 'successfully', 'mixing', 'torts', 'titillating', 'good', 'balance', 'eluded', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'years', 'premise', 'show', 'Bobby', 'Donnell', 'head', 'law', 'firm', 'barely', 'managing', 'keep', 'financially', 'afloat', 'due', 'kinds', 'cases', 'firm', 'fact', 'have', 'trouble', 'collecting', 'fees', 'more', 'few', 'clients', 'However', 'lawyers', 'are', 'kind', 'people', 'would', 'always', 'want', 'side', 'have', 'can-do', 'attitude', 'seem', 'relish', 'uphill', 'fight', 'fact', 'several', 'points', 'show', 'remind', 'one', 'reason', 'took', 'uncertainty', 'lesser', 'remuneration', 'starting', 'own', 'law', 'firm', 'was', 'so', 'could', 'choose', 'battles', 'rather', 'work', 'big', 'firm', 'where', 'price', 'financial', 'safety', 'would', 'be', 'representing', 'big', 'corporate', 'clients', 'right', 'wrong', 'show', 'large', 'sexual', 'component', 'several', 'average', 'looking', 'even', 'outright', 'plain', 'looking', 'folk', 'regular', 'castmembers', 'Furthermore', 'average', 'looking', 'people', 'more', 'share', 'physical', 'flaws', 'are', 'actually', 'given', 'meaningful', 'personal', 'lives', 'Creator', 'David', 'E.', 'Kelley', 'actually', 'wrote', 'five', 'first', 'six', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'performances', 'many', 'shows', 'where', 'characters', 'struggle', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'actors', 'actresses', 'have', 'personalities', 'down', 'pat', 'opening', 'lines.Since', 'DVD', 'recreating', 'season', 'one', 'Practice', 'was', 'originally', 'planned', 'will', 'be', 'missing', 'highlights', 'season', 'two', 'First', 'romance', 'Bobby', 'Donnell', 'Helen', 'Gamble', 'long', 'build-up', 'short', 'duration', 'season', 'two', 'long', 'period', 'reprisals', 'two', 'finally', 'become', 'friends', 'episodes', 'will', 'be', 'missing', 'installment', 'Also', 'Joey', 'Heric', 'flamboyent', 'defendant', 'who', 'several', 'appearances', 'years', 'excellently', 'played', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'will', 'be', 'missing', 'volume', 'first', 'appearance', 'Betrayal', 'not', 'set', 'Joey', 'always', 'embarrassingly', 'guilty', 'homicide', 'be', 'accused', 'Dare', 'Convict', 'Me', 'attitude.If', 'watched', 'Ally', 'McBeal', 'David', 'E.', 'Kelley', 'legal', 'show', 'also', 'based', 'Boston', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'notice', 'two', 'shows', 'are', 'sharing', 'more', 'few', 'judges', 'only', 'sense', 'think', 'Removing', 'seven', 'episodes', 'volume', 'one', '21', 'episodes', 'remaining', 'actual', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'broadcast', 'hope', 'future', 'volumes', 'show', 'will', 'end', 'actual', 'season', 'boundaries', 'several', 'seasons', 'end', 'cliffhangers', 'busting', 'up', 'seasons', 'further', 'would', 'rather', 'ruin', 'continuity']",The Practice - Volume One

May,"[5, 5]","If you'/re looking for a TV show with superb acting, interesting storylines and plot twists that will make you jump out of your seat, look no further than ""The Practice"".Before it came to an inevitable end in 2004 after eight seasons, the latter of which increasing in decline, David E. Kelley's TV show about a law practice with a lot of passion and dedication who would stop at nothing for justice was one of the best shows on television.  Unfortunately Season 1, which was released in 2007, is currently the only available season on DVD.The show took place in Boston and featured the firm of Robert Donnell and Associates, later changing its name over time with the addition and removal of members.Dylan McDermott stars as Bobby Donnell, who has so much passion and heart that you are swept up in his emotions right along with him.  He cares as deeply about his associates' victories as he does for his own.  He sometimes loses his temper but can be made to see the hope when it looks like there isn't any left.Steve Young is Eugene, the former private investigator turned defense attorney who is as good at quick wit as he is with law.  This is evident when, in one episode at the beginning of the series, he is walking through a jail, stops and asks the men behind bars, ""how many of you here DIDN'T do it?"", which is met with a chorus of protests begging to be heard.Kelli Williams is Lindsay, the highly intelligent newbie lawyer who achieves an almost impossible victory in the beginning episodes of the show and gives you a great insight to her fierce tenacity.  She has a strong need to get it right and her naivete decreases with her experience and exposure to more cases.Camryn Manheim is Ellenor, another excellent lawyer who often times gets carried away and ends up in more trouble than she realizes.  A main theme explored for Ellenor is her hopes of finding love, which she has quite terrible luck in, to say the least, as the series progresses.Michael Badalucco is Jimmy Berluti, who helps Bobby out in a big way in the beginning of the series but gets fired for it due to a lack of ethics.  So to help Jimmy right back, Bobby hires him to work with the practice, since Jimmy was a former lawyer.  Unfortunately, he was never any good.  He never won a case.Lisa Gay Hamilton is Rebecca who, at the beginning of the series, is the office receptionist.  She and Bobby started his practice together.  She helps to center Bobby when he allows himself to fall into despair.Lara Flynn Boyle joins the cast in Season 2 as Helen Gamble, the main prosecutor who has a brief fling with Bobby but ultimately respects his firm.  However, put up against them in court, she will stop at nothing to gain her victory.Every case is interesting.  Every character is dynamic.  The acting is brilliant and the surprises will keep your interest.  If you loved L.A. Law, you should definitely check this out, since Kelley created that also.  But if you love law shows in general, especially well-acted ones, than you should not miss ""The Practice"".",4,An excellently acted television drama...,1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,3044,"[""you'/re"", 'looking', 'TV', 'show', 'superb', 'acting', 'interesting', 'storylines', 'plot', 'twists', 'will', 'make', 'jump', 'seat', 'look', 'further', 'Practice', 'came', 'inevitable', 'end', '2004', 'eight', 'seasons', 'latter', 'increasing', 'decline', 'David', 'E.', 'Kelley', 'TV', 'show', 'law', 'practice', 'lot', 'passion', 'dedication', 'who', 'would', 'stop', 'nothing', 'justice', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'Unfortunately', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'released', '2007', 'currently', 'only', 'available', 'season', 'DVD.The', 'show', 'took', 'place', 'Boston', 'featured', 'firm', 'Robert', 'Donnell', 'Associates', 'later', 'changing', 'name', 'time', 'addition', 'removal', 'members.Dylan', 'McDermott', 'Bobby', 'Donnell', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'passion', 'heart', 'are', 'swept', 'up', 'emotions', 'right', 'deeply', 'associates', 'victories', 'own', 'temper', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'see', 'hope', 'when', ""n't"", 'left.Steve', 'Young', 'Eugene', 'former', 'private', 'investigator', 'turned', 'defense', 'attorney', 'who', 'as', 'good', 'quick', 'wit', 'law', 'evident', 'when', 'one', 'episode', 'beginning', 'series', 'walking', 'jail', 'stops', 'men', 'bars', 'how', 'many', 'here', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'do', 'met', 'chorus', 'protests', 'begging', 'be', 'heard.Kelli', 'Williams', 'Lindsay', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'newbie', 'lawyer', 'who', 'almost', 'impossible', 'victory', 'beginning', 'episodes', 'show', 'great', 'insight', 'fierce', 'tenacity', 'strong', 'need', 'get', 'right', 'naivete', 'decreases', 'experience', 'exposure', 'more', 'cases.Camryn', 'Manheim', 'Ellenor', 'excellent', 'lawyer', 'who', 'often', 'carried', 'away', 'up', 'more', 'trouble', 'main', 'theme', 'explored', 'Ellenor', 'hopes', 'finding', 'love', 'quite', 'terrible', 'luck', 'say', 'least', 'series', 'progresses.Michael', 'Badalucco', 'Jimmy', 'Berluti', 'who', 'Bobby', 'out', 'big', 'way', 'beginning', 'series', 'fired', 'due', 'lack', 'ethics', 'So', 'help', 'Jimmy', 'right', 'back', 'Bobby', 'work', 'practice', 'Jimmy', 'was', 'former', 'lawyer', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'never', 'good', 'never', 'won', 'case.Lisa', 'Gay', 'Hamilton', 'Rebecca', 'who', 'beginning', 'series', 'office', 'receptionist', 'Bobby', 'started', 'practice', 'together', 'center', 'Bobby', 'when', 'fall', 'despair.Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'cast', 'Season', '2', 'Helen', 'Gamble', 'main', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'brief', 'fling', 'Bobby', 'ultimately', 'firm', 'However', 'put', 'up', 'court', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'gain', 'victory.Every', 'case', 'interesting', 'character', 'dynamic', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'surprises', 'will', 'keep', 'interest', 'loved', 'L.A.', 'Law', 'should', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'Kelley', 'created', 'also', 'love', 'law', 'shows', 'general', 'especially', 'well-acted', 'ones', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'Practice']",The Practice - Volume One
1062885,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000O77SOK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[60, 62]","David E. Kelley created ""The Practice"" to be the flip side of ""L.A. Law,"" the show for which he wrote 67 episodes and won his first Emmys.  Bobby Donell and his partners are not a prestigious law firm in Hollywood, they are scrambling to stay solvent in Bean Town and do it defending clients who are so obviously guilty it is painful.  The series lasted eight episodes before it morphed into ""Boston Legal,"" and the keystone for the series was how both sides were always passionate about their positions, and somtimes too passionate.  Cold logic is rarely the key to courtroom success in this series, which is just as well because you have clients that run the spectrum from ""Free Willy,"" who likes to expose himself in public, to Gerald Braun, who murders his daughter's killer with the approval of his rabbi.  Not surprisingly, these cases take multiple episodes to resolve.Pay attention to the fact that this is ""The Practice: Volume One"" and not ""The Practice: Season One.""  The show was a replacement series that first aired on March 4, 1997, and the first season was just six episodes.  The second season was a whopping 28 episodes, so the first seven are included in this set of 4-discs.  That still leaves 21 episodes from the second season to make up ""Volume Two"" down the road.  This line of demarcation strikes me as strange because 20 episodes on five discs would seem to make more sense, but once we see the next volume the rationale should become clear.Watching these early episodes again it was interesting to see how Kelley takes advantage of what is a large cast for a ""small"" law firm.  Having a favorite is problematic because they might not have a case go to trial for a while (Eleanor always seems to be second chair early on).  But everybody pretty gets their chance to shine: Bobby defending Rachel Reynolds in the ""Pilot,"" Lindsey takes on the tobacco company defended by her law professor (""Part IV""), Eugene making a bet with a prosecutor on the case of Steven Frenault arrested for armed robbery (""Part V""), Jimmy with a little girl bit by a dog (""Dog Bite""), and Eleanor sued by George Vogleman (""Sex, Lies, and Monkeys"").This is a show where the judges matter, with Linda Hunt as Judge Zoey Hiller clearly standing out along with Ed Asner as Judge Matlin Pratt in ""The Blessing.""  One of the fun things is seeing familiar faces as judges, from Ron Glass to Armin Shimerman, but what the judges have to say about the lawyers (on both sides) is part of the equation.  Sometimes the clients take over the show, of which there is no better example than John Larroquette as Joey Heric in ""Betrayal,"" although I also remember John Carroll Lynch as Dr. Robert Larson in ""Search and Seizure,"" the final episode in this collection.

I have had the first seasons for quite some time now and the additional seasons are nowhere on the horizon. For those of us who loved these classic TV shows I wish the studios would just offer the entire series at once. In the long run it would save them money. I would rather pay $200 for an entire series of The Practice than wait years and have to keep handing over $30 or $40 for each season as they dribble out ...Now can someone explain why shows that are currently on TV have vastly more seasons out then the classic shows?

This is the show that had made me love everything legal. Given the show's excellent caliber and accolades, its successful eight-year run, the exponentially insistent demand from the devotees and the fact that it'd been 2 long years since volume 1 had been released, I'm profoundly incredulous and frustrated as to why the remaining seasons aren't yet out on DVD.Virtually every single show is out on DVD (and some of these shows aren't as brilliant as The Practice), save for this! It's rumored that the music rights is attributable to the protracted delay but nevertheless it shouldn't take THIS L O N G! All of Boston Legal's five seasons (my other favorite show that's secondary to The Practice) are available on DVD even though it is The Practice's successor, therefore the bone of contention cannot be the music rights.Whatever it may be, I along with a legion of die-hard fans are incredibly TIRED of waiting!! I need my court-room drama fix that only The Practice can satiate (well, that and to stare into Dylan McDermott's baby blues). PLEASE release the remaining seasons of this exceptionally magnificent and addictive show and don't make us wait till 2010 for the long-awaited volume 2 and another ten years for the rest of the seasons!
