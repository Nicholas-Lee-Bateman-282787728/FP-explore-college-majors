167313,A2XBBQ36STNJ0G,0966691156,here_is_your_review,"[3, 3]","I caught this movie late one night(!) on Christian TV. I really enjoyed Brad Heller in ""The Moment After"" and ""End of the Harvest"" especially. Here, Brad plays a little bit different character; a man who's never heard the Gospel. Not only that, he's hostile towards Christians because he doesn't understand what it's all about. What transpires is a dramatization of a Christian trying to reach Brad's character. Very well done.I've watched and now own several movies by the Christiano Brothers and they're really great to watch and share. While inquiring about a movie, I eventually exchanged some emails and became acquainted with Dave Christiano, the director of this film. Dave has a real heart to reach people with the Gospel. Towards that end, Dave and his brother Rich approach the Gospel from multiple angles. Their stories are always fresh and innovative. I recommend their movies highly!",5,Terrific Christian Drama ... and a Surprise Ending!!!,1051142400,"04 24, 2003",2003,896,"['caught', 'movie', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'Christian', 'TV', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Brad', 'Heller', 'Moment', 'End', 'Harvest', 'especially', 'Here', 'Brad', 'little', 'bit', 'different', 'character', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'heard', 'Gospel', 'Not', 'only', 'that', 'hostile', 'towards', 'Christians', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'about', 'What', 'dramatization', 'Christian', 'trying', 'reach', 'Brad', 'character', 'Very', 'well', 'done.I', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'now', 'own', 'several', 'movies', 'Christiano', 'Brothers', ""'re"", 'really', 'great', 'watch', 'share', 'inquiring', 'movie', 'eventually', 'exchanged', 'emails', 'became', 'acquainted', 'Dave', 'Christiano', 'director', 'film', 'Dave', 'real', 'heart', 'reach', 'people', 'Gospel', 'Towards', 'end', 'Dave', 'brother', 'Rich', 'Gospel', 'multiple', 'angles', 'stories', 'are', 'always', 'fresh', 'innovative', 'recommend', 'movies', 'highly']",N/A

167318,A1F7CMDX6QDJVA,0966691156,"shoutgrace ""savedbyhisgrace""","[3, 3]","Late One Night is a very thought provoking 33 minute drama. It has answers to questions ask by so many people seeking an answer to their life. It asks the question, ""Am I going to Hell when I die?"" For those who are searching the truth of destiny after death into eternity. What you will see and hear in the video the choice will be up to you.The film opens with Romans 12:21, ""Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."" The scene flashback of a husband & father with hate and resentment leaving a mother and son abandoned, unloved and alone. Switches to the troubled young man locked up in jail and then to a bar scene in the search for companionship and the pain of rejection. This builds up to the scene in the diner where our drama starts. Three factory workers make their usual stop. A  lone man walks in the night towards the diner. The street preacher on the corner says to the man, ""Did ya know God Loves You?"" He responds humbly with a smile. In this conversation the streetman tells us that lots of people know facts about Jesus but do they know that Jesus is in their heart?The man enters into the diner. There in the booth are the three factory workers. The man takes his seat at the counter. One of the workers, the troubled man called the antagonist named Larry tries to make conversation with the man but he doesn't respond. Larry is bothered by this. The man rises from his chair takes off his coat and walks to the back of the diner. Larry then goes over to the man coat and looks in his coat pocket and finds the 'God Loves You' tract and sees the man is a Christian. The man returns. The antagonist reads it aloud. He tauts the man and calls him Jesus. A Christian co-worker at the factory told Larry that he and his frioends were going to Hell if they didn't know Jesus. He tauts the man at the counter again with the question, ""Ok, Jesus, when I die I'm I going to Hell?"" The man can't answer him. Larry goes back to the booth and this is where the dialogue becomes intense about the most important issue in life and eternity. Larry reads, ""God Loves You and has a wonderful plan for you. It was in the beginning when God created Earth and then he created Adam & Eve. When man sinned this caused a separation between man and God. Because of this everyone born in the world except those redeemed will die and go to Hell. ""I bet ya there are alot of people are in Hell right now burning and screaming. Yeah, and there's Christians wondering what they did wrong. If Hell is Real then it's loaded with people. Right? If Chrisitans don't believe in Hell why should sinners?"" The Christian man said, ""Everyone in the world is born a sinner. They need to be spiritually born again. Sin blinds them to the truth. Sin is killing everyone. It's 100 percent fatal. The Bible says that you must be born again. Seek God. Read the Bible and know Jesus. Read John 3:3. Jesus will come back.One day Christ will return to Earth soon. The world is going to see rough days ahead, chaos, trouble and confusion. Lies and deception everywhere. God will pour out His wrath. He means business. his patience is running out. Jesus is Real. Everyone is going to die. We can't escape it. We have a choice Heaven or Hell. We will step out of time into eternity. Take time to read the bible and know the truth. God will show you the way. The truth will set you free.You know how old you are. Add 100 years. Where will you be? God Loves You. He does. It's not a lie like you think. God Loves You. With everything that had happened in Larry's life in his desperation. Tell that to a person whose parents deserted them. See a loved one hurt and scarifice just to keep you alive. Those who seen the inside of a jail. Working a dead end job. No Spouse. No Kids. No Friends. Nothing but trash in your life. And, God still Loves you? The man roughed up by Larry leaves sadly and walks out into the night. Without answering Larry's question. As Larry and his friends leave in haste ask the diner owner for the bill. He told them to ""forget it. Jesus paid your bill!"" According to Romans 5:8. The message of the film asks, Do you know that God Loves You? God sent His Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ. Christ died for you. He was buried and rose from the grave to give you eternal life. Have you made Him Lord and Savior of your life? Life is like a boat when you got Jesus in your life you're on Noah's Ark. If you don't, you got the Titanic. Jesus is the Only Way to the Father. Live for the Lord.
