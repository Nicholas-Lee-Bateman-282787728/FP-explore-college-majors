She's in a good place these days, and does she ever show it; she's happy to be on stage, happy to be in front of her devoted fans, happy to be singing her classic songs. The 17-song set list is a really ecletic mix from her career plus several covers (I'd never have dreamed back when I first became a fan of hers a quarter of a century ago that she'd one day cover Led Zeppelin's ""Rock and Roll"" regularly live, but she does!)

Actually, I'd say better than ever after all these years.The price of this DVD is justified simply to be able to hear Sara performed live.  I guess it wasn't performed live since 1979.  It is an amazing, very laid back version of Sara.I love how Stevie mixes things up with new endings to songs.  Gold Dust Woman has an interesting finish.I guess what amazes me most is that Stevie seems to have found new energy.  And her voice is truly better than it has ever been.  She is really belting out some of the songs while in the past I've always thought she was a bit reserved.The duets with Vanessa Carlton are amazing.  Duets prove how powerful a voice Stevie has because it can be mixed with another in harmonies and it still comes on in full force.This is the DVD of Stevie songs that is a most for any collection.  It is a far better mix of songs performed with Stevie at her peak.I have been listening to the CD and watching the DVD for two weeks and I had to come back and edit this review because I now truly believe this collect of songs in this performance is Stevie at her absolute best.As incredible as I believe Stevie's solo career has been, I have always believed she was at her absolute best when she was with Fleetwood Mac.

1158103,A2P0Y85C896QIB,B0017WI5JI,Thomas Raven,"[1, 2]","I've always loved Stevie's work, especially the songs she recorded with FM.  Some of it, mostly the portion prior to The Wild Heart, still holds up, but nowadays a lot of it sounds like it came from 80's night at the karaoke club.  Unfortunately, despite a very good set of session players, this performance looks back more than it looks forward.  While technically excellent, it only inspires through nostalgia.  I think these songs, and Stevie, deserve better.  I just wonder what might have been if Stevie had been able to rework some of those 80's hits for today.  Much like Lindsey's concert rendition of Big Love, I think she could've opened a keg of dynamite.  Instead, we have this - a nice concert, with nice players and nice songs but with very little fire.  Even Waddy's turned way down most of the time.To add insult, it sounds like there's lots of auto-tuning going on here.  I have no idea if it was applied live or if it was done after the fact, but Stevie has never had a pitch-perfect voice.  That's one of the things I love about her - she's definitely not of the American Idol generation!  Whatever the reasoning behind this aberration, it just doesn't sound right to me.

Gordon ""StolenMoments""","[6, 26]","Someone involved in this lackluster production tried to bring Stevie back to her 1981 Bella Donna Tour concert heyday.  Even brought back Waddy Watchel on guitar--(never thought he could be bland, but here, he is)--even redid yet another performance of ""I Need To Know"".  Like all of Stevie's concerts over the past three decades, the song picks are mostly the same, the arrangements are exactly alike, and her vocalizations are word-for-word, sound-for-wailing sound.  Nothing new, nothing ventured, and nothing gained in this concert. I have loved Stevie since 1975, but feel cheated that she cannot attempt to produce a new show for her devotees, and feel as though she is just taking the lazy way out to make yet another dollar off the same old show.  Her lackluster, spiritless performance in this concert saddened me, and I will not watch this performance DVD again.  I'd rather watch the ""original"" version of this concert, the 1981 Bella Donna Tour (only available on VHS, to my knowledge), wherein she had all of the charm and spirit of a performer singing a new, beloved show for her audience.  I'm not one to compare, but if Stevie put together a new show arrangement for each tour like Madonna does, I'd be one to attend Stevie's concerts, rather than borrow or buy the",2,"Spiritless, Same Old, Same Old Performances",1238544000,"04 1, 2009",2009,1281,"['Someone', 'involved', 'lackluster', 'production', 'tried', 'bring', 'Stevie', 'back', '1981', 'Bella', 'Donna', 'Tour', 'concert', 'heyday', 'Even', 'brought', 'back', 'Waddy', 'Watchel', 'guitar', 'never', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'bland', 'here', 'even', 'redid', 'yet', 'performance', 'Need', 'Know', 'Stevie', 'concerts', 'past', 'three', 'decades', 'song', 'picks', 'are', 'mostly', 'same', 'arrangements', 'are', 'exactly', 'alike', 'vocalizations', 'are', 'word-for-word', 'sound-for-wailing', 'sound', 'Nothing', 'new', 'nothing', 'ventured', 'nothing', 'gained', 'concert', 'have', 'loved', 'Stevie', '1975', 'feel', 'cheated', 'can', 'not', 'attempt', 'produce', 'new', 'show', 'devotees', 'feel', 'just', 'taking', 'lazy', 'way', 'make', 'yet', 'dollar', 'same', 'old', 'show', 'lackluster', 'spiritless', 'performance', 'concert', 'saddened', 'will', 'not', 'watch', 'performance', 'DVD', 'again', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'original', 'version', 'concert', '1981', 'Bella', 'Donna', 'Tour', 'only', 'available', 'VHS', 'knowledge', 'had', 'charm', 'spirit', 'performer', 'singing', 'new', 'beloved', 'show', 'audience', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'compare', 'Stevie', 'put', 'together', 'new', 'show', 'arrangement', 'tour', 'Madonna', ""'d"", 'be', 'one', 'attend', 'Stevie', 'concerts', 'rather', 'borrow', 'buy']",N/A
