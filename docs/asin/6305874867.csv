481646,A1AAN285FE45GP,6305874867,A. Fultz,"[7, 10]","This film displays a nice combination of dry, somewhat dark comedy and fun suspense.  Likely classified as a comedy, there are some good plot twists and turns that also make the film work as a good crime story, too.The  film centers around Charlie (Liam Neeson), a DEA agent who has had  one-too-many brushes with death.  He is burned out and ready to retire to a  seaside resort, but has to complete one last mission first.  A chance  encounter with a psychiatrist, and a resulting meeting with a lovely woman  (Sandra Bullock) who performs a very personal medical procedure that leads  to a date, change Charlie's life and outlook.  As Charlie makes his way to  the end of his mission, his story takes some interesting twists, and there  is a good deal of laugh-out-loud humor along the way.Although I have  always considered Neeson and Bullock overrated, both turn in solid  performances.  But, it is the supporting cast, headed by Oliver Platt, that  make this movie really tick.  Jose Zuniga, Michael DeLorenzo, Mitch  Pileggi, Colin Albertson and Mary McCormack round out a cast of familiar  faces whose name escape all but the hardcore movie buff.This is a good,  solid film.

481647,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6305874867,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 7]","I was very surprised by this film.  I had overhead so many negative reviews of this feature that I think it had seeped to deeply into my mind when I chose to pick it up.  I had already thought that it was going to be a poor excuse of a film when I placed it in my DVD player, but to my surprise (literally), this was actually a well developed, superbly acted film.  Now, it wasn't the greatest movie that I have ever seen, but as far as entertainment goes, this film did lift an eyebrow.  The script was loose, but well thought out, the acting was well above your average independent feature, and the tone was light.  I think that is what I liked most about this film (outside of the acting) was that it never went too deep into itself, but instead kept it light and seemingly fluffy.  In an era of over-zealous directors, Eric Blakeney proved to me that he could gather great actors, place them in a decent story, and produce amazing results.  I wish other directors would take his lead and push more towards this than just giving up and relying on the name of the actor to sell their film.There are three elements that really caught my attention while watching this film, and I must begin with the acting.  You had in this film some of Hollywood's most dramatic, comedic, and talented people doing their best work in this little film called Gun Shy.  Liam Neeson represented his character so well, that I nearly forgot most of the time that he was Neeson from Schindler's List, but instead this neurotic agent with problems around every bend.  The twitching of his hands, the ability to bring life to his words and his comedic timing was brilliant.  He really was a shining light in this film.  This rubbed off onto the others in this film causing greatness from everyone.  Oliver Platt was hysterical playing off of every Italian stereotype that can be seen in such hits as The Sopranos and The Godfather, but he does it with so much originality and creativity that it feels and smells fresh.  I found myself laughing at everything Platt did, and he played so well against Neeson that I am surprised that the two haven't made more films together.  Then there was Sandra.  While this wasn't the mightiest role for her, she was enjoyable to watch.  She didn't overdo it, nor was she lacking.  She was the only average character in the film, and I blame this in part to only having a few short scenes in the film (kinda underdeveloped).  The rest of the cast was well above par.  What was interesting about the characters and actors of Gun Shy is that I wanted to watch them.  They, unlike some recent Hollywood blockbusters, brought life into the film and they had ""fun"" (a Hollywood curse word) with this production.  You could tell, and it provided some enjoyable cinema.The next element was the story.  Director/writer Eric Blakeney did a great job of complementing the actors with a simple script.  This may sound like an insult, but so many times we watch films that have this overdeveloped story that causes are actors to get lost, our audience to get lost, and ultimately our film to get lost.  By keeping the story simple, Blakeney was able to bring the best from the actors.  I do believe that the script complimented the actors and pushed them to explore new possibilities of characters.  It was a story that we had seen time and time again, but again, like the acting, it seemed original and fresh because it was simple and complete.  My only gripes about the story is that it could have developed Bullock's character a bit more and sharpened the ending a bit, but that is all.  Honestly, I thought the film worked the way the script was written, no changes were needed, but healthy constructive feedback is always welcomed.Finally, I would like to say that I loved the theme of this film.  Perhaps it is where I am in my life that allowed it to hit me so hard, but for me it was sheer bliss.  Here you have a story, which all the central characters hate, loathe, and dislike their lives.  From Charlie's hatred and fear of getting killed by his job, to Fulvio's passion for a better life, to the Colombian's wanting to escape in love together, to even all of Charlie's friends in his group therapy that hate their lives as well, there is just this overwhelming sense of dislike for the world when this film begins.  As we grow with our characters, they begin to see the brighter side of life and that we all need that moment of change to help us grow and develop ourselves.  I thought this was a great theme to bring into a zany mob comedy, but it worked.  So many times in Hollywood we see the happy family man who gets caught up in the mob mess, but never have we seen so many disillusioned people gathered in one film and still make it a comedy.  It was very close to perfection.Overall, I enjoyed this film.  I will say it again, it wasn't the best I have ever seen, but it did provide two hours of entertainment and sometimes that is all you can ask of a film (though lately it is becoming harder and harder).  The acting is what pulled me into the picture, and the depressing beginning theme kept me glued to the screen.  I surprise myself sometimes because this was not a ""crazy film"".  It was a generic story that allowed the actors and the director to be original and creative.  You don't see that much anymore, and it was sheer bliss to finally witness it in the film Gun Shy.Grade: **** out of *****",4,Narco-sleepy.

Geez, I just watched it again last week and already I want to do so for the umpteenth time.Neeson is undercover DEA agent 'Charlie' Mayeaux (pronounced May-YO). When he's betrayed by a fellow agent and almost killed, all Charlie wants to do is retire and seek ""the ocean view."" His superiors insist he hang in and finish this last assignment, a market-cornering scheme that involves Fulvio, a Columbian druglord named Fidel Vaillar (Jos&eacute; Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga), Fidel's boyfriend Estuvio (Michael DeLorenzo) and the Wall Street arranger/inside trader Jason Cane (Andy Lauer).Charlie's fears for his life are causing him huge stress. He sees a shrink, becomes part of a professional mens' group therapy (some wackos there) and is sent by the psychiatrist to a gastroenterologist (for 'intermittent flatulence'), where he meets Judy and gets a barium enema while she cracks a series of jokes.From this odd chance meeting, they become a couple. Charlie's deal goes forward and he learns in the process that even the bad guys are dissatisfied with their lives. Fulvio is married to the Don's daughter, who's a REAL B word. His only dream is to grow tomatoes in Sicily and not be a gangster. Fidel and Estuvio also want to abandon crime and design clothes together.I wish there were some way I could impart how witty and entertaning this film is right down to the smallest detail, like the music score.

Also caught up in this m&eacute;lange is the Mafia represented, however reluctantly, by Fulvio Nestra (Oliver Platt), a nerdy but vicious bungler whose temper is uncontrollable, partly due to his insipid belittling wife Gloria (Mary McCormack) whose father demands Fulvio's crime life importance.  Charlie is a mess, meets a psychologist who introduces him to group therapy (where Charlie idiotically relates all the DEA secrets openly) and to gastroenterology where nurse Judy (Sandra Bullock) administers a barium enema then other more herbal-sided treatments while she and Charlie become bonded.  People are maimed (gunshot castration), killed, made to look foolish, all to the end of supposedly belly laughs on the part of the audience.True, Neeson shows a flair for comedy and Platt manages to convey a breakthrough role for him, but the rest is a jumbled mess.  Made in 2000 with the Twin Towers of New York frequently visible during talk against Arabs and the Middle East, it is easy to see why the timing of this 'yet another Mafia vs law' film contributed to its short theater run (how many have even heard of it?).

A near death experience, while witnessing his partner being murdered, has caused a certified psychiatric mental breakdown. Don't even think to ask about watermelons.But regardless of his ever fragile mental state and ensuing physical ailments, which hilariously includes the loss of bowel control, his DEA bosses insist he continue his mission to take out two wannabe drug cartels. One cartel led by the unloved son-in-law of an Italian mob boss. The other, led by the unloved son of a Columbian cocaine king. The former because he's a homicidal nutter, the latter because... well, it's sort of nut-related too. :-DIt's Charlie's job to break their evolving empire. The problem is, without powerful prescription drugs, he's seriously unstable and more likely to take down his drawers to do a Number Two - rather than take down a bunch of bad guys.Let me preface the following by saying Oliver Platt is one of my favorite actors. His role as the other half of this unconventional buddy-buddy flick is insanely funny.Platt portrays Fulvio Nesstra, the mob hitman whose continual self-defeating instinct toward every life situation is to just whack you. And I mean every situation, like what happens to the poor (and innocent) neighbor whom Fulvio believes is stealing his morning paper. Watching his constant and continual efforts to control that instinct is *hilarious*.Despite the fact Fulvio is borderline psychotic, in his defense, I honestly believe you can be ""made"" to become insane if specific pressures and extreme circumstances force the condition on you. I'm not debating the official psychiatric diagnosis, only as it applies to this funny dark comedic performance delivered by Platt.There's an almost child-like tenderness which shows he has profound regrets becoming the cleaner for the family. And one imagines it's the only life he's ever known; a prisoner of circumstance.

Every review I've read on Amazon has given it 5 stars, and it did nothing for me. I got bored halfway through, probably cos I wasn't paying any attention whatsoever, and by the ending, I was completely and utterly lost, and couldn't make head or tail of the storyline by that point! And I was sober too.What was extremely disappointing too, was Oliver Platt. I normally love him in films - but normally any film I've seen him in, he's been playing a comedy role. Not in this. I think he was supposed to be the bad guy in this, and it totally didn't suit him. He's great as the comedy guy, the guy making you laugh.Sandra has a very small role in this, but she also produces. She's produced a couple of other films hasn't she? Two Weeks Notice, Murder by Numbers, Miss Congeniality, and Hope Floats. And I liked only half of those. The first two were absolute rubbish. Some people should only be allowed to do certain things, and certainly shouldn't think they can try their hand at everything.I don't know whether I'm just cynical about relationships at the moment, but the whole relationship between Sandra &amp; Liam Neeson's character just didn't ring true with me. They say people can fall in love with someone they meet in the strangest places, but would you really fall in love with someone who performed an enema on you?!

Liam Neeson is a DEA agent who's become disenchanted with his job, and it's turned him into something of a neurotic. He's assigned to go undercover to sting the mob, and he meets a similarly neurotic hit man, whom he befriends (Oliver Platt), while falling in love with, yes, his enema nurse (Sandra Bullock) and trying to achieve rapport with his support group.Sound like a cute comedy? It could have been. Or a decent thriller, playing the mob-infiltration angle. Human drama? Well, maybe not, given the enema-nurse angle, but it might have managed a stab in the right direction. Romance? Maybe. Combine any two of those and you may manage a serviceable movie; comedy-action thrillers have been all the rage since Lethal Weapon. But even that vaunted team couldn't add a third element and keep it working correctly (did anyone really like Lethal Weapon 3?). Not surprisingly, Blakeney comes up with a mess that looks like someone attempted to cook spaghetti, with sauce, in a pressure cooker that exploded. Pass on this one.

Dr. Bleckner talks Charlie into joining his group therapy session, where Charlie unloads the stresses of his job, to the astonishment of the group.  He also talks Charlie into seeing a gastroenterologist, and prescribes some sedatives for him to take before his big meeting with the drug mob.Charlie teams up with Fidel and Estuvio, two Columbians who are bringing in the drugs, and a meeting is arranged with Fulvio Nesstra (Oliver Platt) and his money man Jason Cane (Andrew Lauer).  Fulvio is a frustrated gangster, following along in the family business and trying to please his father-in-law, when what he really wants to do is just be able to grow a good tomato.The meeting is hilarious, with Charlie falling asleep from the drugs while talking with Fulvio, and Fulvio shooting Estuvio in the jewels.Charlie goes to the gastroenterologist and meet nurse Judy Tipp (Sandra Bullock) who tells him that he needs to get his life under control or he will s*** himself to death.  This is probably one of the best scenes in the movie, the enema scene done to the tune of ""Man's World"" while Nurse Tipp chats away.  Charlie and Judy strike up a romance, the chattering Judy giving Charlie the new perspective on life that he needed.Charlie is trying to get through this assignment and nail the drug ring, while Fulvio is trying to get through the deal to make a name for himself, and they strike up an unusual friendship.Things go from bad to worse, as Charlie reveals more and more of his job to his counseling group, becomes more involved with Judy, and goes deeper and deeper into the dealings with Fulvio and the columbians.This is a not-to-be-missed movie; it is well cast and well acted, with a fresh and unique storyline not even comparable to Analyze This or the other movie competitors.  I would go so far to say that Gun Shy is far superior to the competing movies that pushed it into the video stores so quickly, more full of life and humor even with its black undertone.The surprise twist at the end will leave you laughing for a long time, I didn't even see it coming and it was the perfect top off for this excellent dark comedy.
