His films deal with the common everyday life's situations with mothers, fathers, children, families in love, conflict, and death.  Ozu first film was in 1929 and his last in 1962.Use of Red or BlueSince I have not seen all his films, I recognize in many,  an eyecatching motif is the use of colors, namely blue and red.  In Good Morning, almost every scene here you can spot something red standing out.  Whether it is a rug, a pot, shoes, clothes on a line, a wall,  whatever, something in red is strategically placed in the shot.  Blue is used more in the outdoors, like the sky or rooftops.Geometric figuresOzu frequently uses circles or rectangles as background patterns.  Almost all the scenes have these geometric designs.  It is easy to spot.Low-angle camera shotAnother recognizable feature is the use of low-angle, he places the camera the level of the floor;  this is our view of where action is, the floor.Set in 1959, two young boys, and I equate them to young Wally and Beaver Cleaver stage a silent protest until they get a TV.  The younger boy is so adorable, and he so reminds me of little Beaver Cleaver.  He looks up to his older brother, mimics his every move and even exhibits some amusing actions of his own.  The background story is a satirical examination of the communication, gossip, rumor fueled by the adults.  This is humorous and enjoyable.  .....Rizzo",5,Amusing and satirical exam of communication,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,1504,"['Once', 'have', 'watched', 'Ozu', 'film', 'will', 'recognize', 'clearly', 'often', 'same', 'actors', 'fulfill', 'roles', 'films', 'deal', 'common', 'everyday', 'life', 'situations', 'mothers', 'fathers', 'children', 'families', 'love', 'conflict', 'death', 'Ozu', 'first', 'film', 'was', '1929', 'last', '1962.Use', 'Red', 'BlueSince', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'films', 'recognize', 'many', 'eyecatching', 'motif', 'use', 'colors', 'namely', 'blue', 'red', 'Good', 'Morning', 'almost', 'scene', 'here', 'can', 'spot', 'something', 'red', 'standing', 'out', 'rug', 'pot', 'shoes', 'clothes', 'line', 'wall', 'whatever', 'something', 'red', 'strategically', 'placed', 'shot', 'Blue', 'used', 'more', 'outdoors', 'sky', 'rooftops.Geometric', 'figuresOzu', 'frequently', 'circles', 'rectangles', 'background', 'patterns', 'Almost', 'scenes', 'have', 'geometric', 'designs', 'easy', 'spot.Low-angle', 'camera', 'shotAnother', 'recognizable', 'feature', 'use', 'low-angle', 'camera', 'level', 'floor', 'view', 'where', 'action', 'floor.Set', '1959', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'equate', 'young', 'Wally', 'Beaver', 'Cleaver', 'stage', 'silent', 'protest', 'get', 'TV', 'younger', 'boy', 'so', 'adorable', 'so', 'little', 'Beaver', 'Cleaver', 'up', 'older', 'brother', 'mimics', 'move', 'even', 'amusing', 'actions', 'own', 'background', 'story', 'satirical', 'examination', 'communication', 'gossip', 'rumor', 'fueled', 'adults', 'humorous', 'enjoyable', '..Rizzo']",N/A
27269,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,0780023307,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 0]","One of Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu's latter movies (and among his few color films). In a Japanese suburb in the late 1950s, two Japanese tykes (one about 10 years old, the other about 6) decide not to talk to anybody any more until their parents buy them a television set (this film was made in an era where many people in Japan were buying their first TVs).Shot in his traditional transcendental style, this charming comedy shows a more modern Japan than in other Ozu fims of that era (at the same time, the cultural attitudes the movie reflects make it very much a film of the fifties). This was probably one of the first movies made anywhere to deal with life in the suburbs - even if it is set in a very Japanese suburbia (all the houses are very close to each other and its residents constantly interact with each other. There is also constant gossiping around among the housewives). In many ways, Good Morning is a movie about the many changes brought by the modernization and Americanization of Japanese society after World War II, Surprisingly for an Ozu film, this has even a number of gags involving human flatulence.A triumph for Ozu, even if it is probably not as moving as Tokyo Story, Late Spring or Early Summer.

This is one of my favorite films of his.First about Yasujiro Ozu: Ozu does not move the camera.  EVER.  It sits 6 to 12 inches from the ground, as if the viewer were sitting on a tatami mat as a casual and silent observer.  His actors rehearse constantly and rapidly so that all major emotion is taken out of their scene and they act their scenes as if robotic and emotionless.  His underlying themes, messages, and meanings are left for the viewer to fathom. Ozu was pretty set in his ways... he didn't make a color film until the studio forced him, and it was much later than most other Japanese directors.  He also clung to silent films well after 'talkies' were out.This film is about two brothers who are obsessed with television (relatively new in the late 40s, early 50s Japan).  They undergo a vow of silence (after being chastised by their father for talking too much) until their parents buy a TV.  This creates a lot of understated humor.  What I really enjoyed was the gossip and hatefulness that went rampant with the ladies in the neighborhood.  One neighbor mistakes the boy's silence as a personal affront and begins spreading rumors.The acting is superb, especially from the kids (kids are notoriously tough to coach and with Ozu's idiosyncrasies would seem even tougher... but the brothers are superb in this film).  The film features the usual suspects, actors contracted to be used in Ozu's films by the studio.  I thoroughly enjoy these actors, and after time they do seem to adapt more and more to Ozu's style and demands.The film also touches a lot on the capitalism of a growing Japan, a theme he touches on repeatedly throughout his filmography.  There is also an element of love, another of his repeating themes.  An interesting side theme is about communication, how humans spend so much time saying little things (like talking about the weather, etc...).This is not really a remake of his older film as much as a re-imagining of his older film: (I was born but...).If you have the patience to watch Ozu, then this is surely on his must see list.

27271,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,0780023307,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 0]","Of the Big Three Japanese film directors from last century, who were known in the West, Kenji Mizoguchi, Akira Kurosawa, and Yasujiro Ozu, Ozu is by far the least well known, and this is because he was probably the least technically innovative of the troika. But, that is not the same as saying he was the least accomplished. In fact, his 1959 social comedy of manners, Good Morning (Ohayo), set in a modern Tokyo suburban subdivision, is in many ways far more relevant than the more famed period pieces the other directors made, for it has a definite Western sensibility. Ozu seemed to be obsessed with documenting history, but history as it was lived, not re-imagined. He was acutely aware of his role as a social documentarian, if in a fictive sense. It was also his third color film, and on the surface it would seem to narratively square very easily with the 1950s era American television comedies, as the central story of the film revolves around two brothers' silent protest over their clan's refusal to modernize and buy a tv like their friend's family has. It all seems very Beaver Cleaver, but appearances are not everything, especially when the patina is crafted by a Master from another culture.Most of the film is shot in Ozu's famed and unjustly derided low camera angle, with a static lens, lending the charge of `minimalism' to his style. Yet, while that may be true in certain technical aspects, the truth is that the film, written by Ozu and Kogo Noda, is very multi-layered, deftly weaving low comedy- such as excessive farting, and all the modernism that entails, as the boys play a game where one boy presses another's forehead and he farts in response, with deeper social commentary on alcoholism, the `generation gap'- that old saw of the era, unemployment, and the bile of social gossip. The seemingly carefree farting of the children is thus deftly contrasted with the often ineffective social mechanisms of the adults. The title of the film, in fact, has an ironic meaning, for Ozu casts it as being said mostly in a negative and perfunctory way.... Compared with American suburban films from later years, like Ordinary People, or even films made in the last decade, like The Ice Storm or American Beauty, this film does not seem dated, especially compared to American film comedies of the era. Compare it even to a typical Billy Wilder comedy of the era and Ozu's superiority is manifest, almost as much as a fart is to some meaningless bon mot.

It just happens that I'm curious and that I like to discover new directors.Yasujiro Ozu's GOOD MORNING is a comedy. So you will smile a lot during the movie while you discover how lived japanese people of the lower classes in the early sixties. Tradition versus modernism is the eternal problem, modernism being symbolized here by a television set desired by the children of an average family living in the suburbs of a great city. The new generation is learning english at school and one feels that Japan will never be the same when these children will be at command.Yasujiro's cinema is very static, with no camera movements at all. You are going to be hypnotized by long shots of faces or landscapes until you finally appreciate these subtle minutes of silence that the japanese Master will offer you by the dozen. If you are not specially zen these days, you'd better wait for another moment to watch GOOD MORNING.In my opinion, the colours haven't stood the test of time very well and the copy is not perfect with black and white spots at times and also white vertical lines during long minutes.

27274,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0780023307,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","Recently, I have had this urge to watch a Yasujiro Ozu film which I have never seen before.  THE CRITERION COLLECTION has been very devoted to the popular director from Japan with several releases of his films in the United States and one film that I have always wanted to watch and have never gotten to was ""Ohayo"" aka in the US as ""Good Morning"".Many of Ozu's films typically feature aging and in many cases elderly father's who fear that they are wasting their daughters lives because the daughters are dedicated to family and taking care of the parents that they have not had a chance to experience life and love for themselves.But I heard that his 1959 film ""Good Morning"" was among Ozu's most lighthearted, hilarious films about a Japanese family but very different from his previous works.  And dare I say, it was probably one of the first films to use flatulence as a gag throughout the film.  So, needless to say that nearly a decade after its release on DVD, I had to hunt this DVD down.""Good Morning"" takes place in the suburban Tokyo where homes live in close proximity to each other.  Some homes that capture that original Japanese traditional style of home but also combines it with a Western American style of home with the white picket fence all around.The first half of the film features a group of young students and adults who live in a neighborhood of suburban Tokyo.  The kids enjoy a joke of pressing on each other's forehead which they then fart.  The kids are supposedly eating pumice stone (or the powder of it) which enables them to be gassy but one of the kids, unfortunately is unable to producer a fart and somewhat ends up sharding in his pants.But what the kids enjoy the most which is watching television.  A lot of them hang out with this Bohemian neighbors who are seen wearing their pajamas all day or singing scat while walking through the neighborhood.  But of course, the mothers of the children are not too thrilled that the kids are bypassing their studies to watch television.Director Ozu then focuses on the adults in the film.  How the wives practice gossip and how Mrs. Haraguchi, the leader of the women's club who receives the club dues from the other housewives said that she has never received payment and now the other housewives wonder what happened to the money.  When Mrs. Haraguchi of the group (who denies receiving the payment), she becomes the talk of the neighborhood as the family has bought a new washing machine, the other women wonder if their money was used for that purchas.For Mrs. Hayashi, the treasurer of the club, she confronts Mrs. Haraguchi telling her that she gave the money to her mother.  So, as the film focuses on the gossip that happens among the housewives, we then see a variety of things in Japan such as the occasional door-to-door business people trying to sell products such as rubber bands, pencils, toothbrushes, etc.  (note: The business people and occasional neighbors do not knock on the doors and end up opening the doors of their neighbors and sitting in their entry way)  But we start to see how these salespeople are a nuisance to home owners at that time.As for the husbands in the film, they talk about retirement and as part of Japanese culture today, as it was back then, heading to the bar and going out for a drink before heading home.But the film then starts to zero in on the Hayashi family.  The Hayashi children: Minoru and his younger brother Isamu (the main protagonist children in the film) are bored at home and dislike how their parents tell them to avoid going to the neighbors and not watch television (mainly because they think the housewife is a cabaret singer).  This starts to anger Minoru as he doesn't understand why his family can't just buy one.  An argument takes place and when Minoru pushes his parents buttons, their father who is angered, tells them to be quiet and not say any more words.So, in a protest to his family not buying a television, Minoru and his brother do just what their father has said... not to say anymore words and literally not talk anymore.  This sets off a chain of events where the kids inability to talk or say hello to the housewives early in the morning starts to make them think that Mrs. Hayashi is angry at the housewives and have told their children not to talk to them.  Meanwhile, the children who were active in school are no longer saying a word and causing their teachers and their tutors distress and making them wonder why the kids are no longer talking.Will Minoru and Isamu's silence work in their favor and lead to the family buying a television?  Or will their silence continue to be come problematic?VIDEO & AUDIO:""Good Morning"" is a film presented in its original aspect ration of 1:33:1 and features a newer digital transfer created from a 35mm low-contrast composite print.  This was one of the six films in which director Yasujiro Ozu used color and for the most part, I found ""Good Morning"" to be wonderful in the fact that we are seeing a time capsule of Japanese culture as it is becoming westernized.  It has been over a decade since World War II but to see how American culture has permeated into suburban Tokyo with the white picket fences, children learning English classes, people making money through translations, a more westernized home versus the Japanese traditional home.  These things were captured in this 1959 film.As for picture quality, the film is not exactly pristine as you will see dust and film warping throughout the film but it's not so bad where the film is unwatchable.  THE CRITERION COLLECTION used a newer digital transfer but it would be interesting to see if they ever re-release this film via Blu-ray, if new technology would be able to remove the dust and scratches.Audio is in Dolby Digital Mono and I chose to watch the film with my receiver set at ""stereo on all channels"" in order to hear the audio from all around me via my 7.2 setup versus it being center channel driven.  But overall, dialogue is clear.Subtitles are in English and features nice and thick white subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Good Morning"" features no special features but a ""color bar"" test.  There is a four-page booklet featuring Rick Prellinger (an archivist and filmmaker) who writes about this film and director Yasujiro Ozu.JUDGMENT CALL:After watching the film, I can understand why this film was enjoyable but also how the film is almost a time capsule of a time in Japan who where American/Western culture was starting to permeate into Japanese culture.  This is important to note because for the most part, one of the reasons why Ozu's films rarely made it into the United States because many distributors looked at his films as being ""too Japanese"".  And I can only have wished there were some sort of recordings back then, because I would have loved to hear or read an interview in regards to Ozu's thoughts in the making of this film.It was also good to see that Ozu style of filmmaking in which he doesn't use the 180 degree rule and used over-the-shoulder dialogue scenes.  So, the shots used in the film feature the actors and actresses talking directly to you on screen.  My young son who joined me for a short while even asked me during the film ""Dad, why does it look like the people are talking to me?"".  That's a characteristic of Ozu's style of filmmaking.""Good Morning"" was a very fun film that is simple and captures human behavior.  Minoru makes the biggest point in the film where he criticizes adults for meaningless conversations.  Where conversations are either good morning, good afternoon, the weather is nice today and the conversations have no substance.  That was a smart thing for the child to say because we see that emptiness in the conversations of the adults.I also found it so interesting to see the simplicity of life before television and we are seeing that moment of time before households owned a TV and the children being so enamored by it.Minoru and Isamu are just adorable children to watch and its just the certain behaviors, especially from little Isamu that is so natural as he walks around the hallway making punching movements or jumping.  Things that kids do but you just never see in a film.  I thought those little details in life was fun to see in this film.  And as for the children... sure, there are a good number of fart jokes in the film (which is actually not as bad as it reads in my review because its not meant to be disgusting especially compared to how flatulence sounds in today's modern films).As for a release from THE CRITERION COLLECTION, as mentioned earlier, the company has released a good number of Ozu films throughout the years but for this release, the only thing that I wish it had was any kind of special feature.  May it be Ozu interviews, audio interviews or even a commentary from a film scholar who is familiar with Ozu's work.  Even the original Japanese theatrical trailer.  Anything is better than nothing.  But that is the only downer but overall, this film is still worth watching.Overall, ""Good Morning"" is an entertaining and hilarious Japanese film that is so different from Ozu's previous and later works. But I also look at the significance of the film of when it was filmed and the Japanese lifestyle that is showcased and how Western culture started to permeate in Japan in the late 50's which is what I found so fascinating.

27275,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0780023307,Ed Uyeshima,"[12, 12]","Flatulence seems to be an odd way of lending a framework to a film, but leave it to filmmaking master Yasujiro Ozu to use it as a metaphor for the meaninglessness of ""small talk"" between people who cannot be candid with one another. The title of this 1959 movie, ""Ohay (Good Morning)"", is indeed the salutation but also from Ozu's perspective, a symbolic expression of how the Japanese avoid confrontation and put a strong value on etiquette. One of Ozu's late period color films, this is a very cute comedy which on the surface, seems like an extended episode of ""Leave It to Beaver"" especially in exhibiting the speedy Americanization of Japan since WWII. Even the color palette seems to evoke the muted McCarthy-era colors of the Universal comedies release around the same time. What remains consistent are Ozu's signature visual compositions - the use of the hillside to place the horizon in the middle of the frame, the use of silhouettes against the hillside, the movement of figures darting between the identical homes.Set in a shoebox-tight housing community in Tokyo, the plot seamlessly interweaves the activities of five households - four of the more traditional variety and the fifth, a young beatnik couple who has the prized possession of the neighborhood, a TV set, which draws all the children in like clockwork after school. In the meantime, the housewives discover their association dues are missing and in ""Peyton Place""-style, rumors swirl that the culprit is the woman who just bought a washing machine. Further subplots involve an unemployed English teacher, who can only speak banalities to the woman he loves; an older unemployed man who habitually gets drunk at the local bar and can't find his own home since they all look alike; and the funniest about two young brothers, the older particularly obstreperous in furiously sharing his all-too-perceptive observations of the adults - and practicing a strike of silence when their parents refuse to buy a TV set. Of course, that doesn't prevent the brothers and their friends from playing competitive rounds of ""pull my finger"" - a tap on the forehead yields a forced fart.The performances are charming and quite undemanding with several members of Ozu's regular troupe present - Chishu Ryu and Kuniko Miyake (the father and older son's wife in ""Tokyo Story"") as the put-upon parents of the TV-demanding brothers; Haruko Sugimura (the petty daughter in ""Tokyo Story"") as the accused dues pilferer; and Toyoko Takahashi (the Onomichi neighbor in ""Tokyo Story"") as another of the gossipy housewives. As the young people unable to articulate their feelings for each other, Keiji Sada is the English teacher and Yoshiko Kuga is the boys' shy aunt, who couriers the documents for translation. And as the brothers, 13-year old Koji Shitara plays Minoru and seven-year old Masahiko Shimazu is Isamu, the latter particularly adorable when mimicking his older brother. This movie is certainly not in the class of ""Tokyo Story"" or ""Floating Weeds"", but I doubt if Ozu intended it to be. It's just a gentle, well-coordinated, sometimes hilarious poke at Japanese cultural traditions, a parable masquerading as a family comedy. Personally this is the Ozu film I can relate to the most since it speaks to my generation of Japanese-born Americans. The DVD package from the Criterion Collection is surprisingly sparse - no audio commentary, no trailer - but the video transfer and sound quality are excellent.",4,Delightful Sitcom Bears Ozu's Depth and Then Some,1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,3467,"['Flatulence', 'be', 'odd', 'way', 'lending', 'framework', 'film', 'leave', 'filmmaking', 'master', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'use', 'metaphor', 'meaninglessness', 'small', 'talk', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'candid', 'one', 'title', '1959', 'movie', 'Ohay', 'Good', 'Morning', 'indeed', 'salutation', 'also', 'Ozu', 'perspective', 'symbolic', 'expression', 'how', 'Japanese', 'avoid', 'confrontation', 'put', 'strong', 'value', 'etiquette', 'One', 'Ozu', 'late', 'period', 'color', 'films', 'very', 'cute', 'comedy', 'surface', 'extended', 'episode', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'especially', 'exhibiting', 'speedy', 'Americanization', 'Japan', 'WWII', 'Even', 'color', 'palette', 'evoke', 'muted', 'McCarthy-era', 'colors', 'Universal', 'comedies', 'release', 'same', 'time', 'What', 'consistent', 'are', 'Ozu', 'signature', 'visual', 'compositions', 'use', 'hillside', 'place', 'horizon', 'middle', 'frame', 'use', 'silhouettes', 'hillside', 'movement', 'figures', 'darting', 'identical', 'homes.Set', 'shoebox-tight', 'housing', 'community', 'Tokyo', 'plot', 'seamlessly', 'activities', 'five', 'households', 'four', 'more', 'traditional', 'variety', 'fifth', 'young', 'beatnik', 'couple', 'who', 'prized', 'possession', 'neighborhood', 'TV', 'set', 'children', 'clockwork', 'school', 'meantime', 'housewives', 'discover', 'association', 'dues', 'are', 'missing', 'Peyton', 'Place', '-style', 'rumors', 'swirl', 'culprit', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'bought', 'washing', 'machine', 'Further', 'subplots', 'involve', 'unemployed', 'English', 'teacher', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'speak', 'banalities', 'woman', 'older', 'unemployed', 'man', 'who', 'habitually', 'drunk', 'local', 'bar', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'own', 'home', 'look', 'funniest', 'two', 'young', 'brothers', 'older', 'particularly', 'obstreperous', 'furiously', 'sharing', 'all-too-perceptive', 'observations', 'adults', 'practicing', 'strike', 'silence', 'when', 'parents', 'refuse', 'buy', 'TV', 'set', 'course', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'brothers', 'friends', 'playing', 'competitive', 'rounds', 'pull', 'finger', 'tap', 'forehead', 'yields', 'forced', 'fart.The', 'performances', 'are', 'charming', 'quite', 'undemanding', 'several', 'members', 'Ozu', 'regular', 'troupe', 'present', 'Chishu', 'Ryu', 'Kuniko', 'Miyake', 'father', 'older', 'son', 'wife', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'put-upon', 'parents', 'TV-demanding', 'brothers', 'Haruko', 'Sugimura', 'petty', 'daughter', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'accused', 'dues', 'pilferer', 'Toyoko', 'Takahashi', 'Onomichi', 'neighbor', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'gossipy', 'housewives', 'young', 'people', 'unable', 'articulate', 'feelings', 'other', 'Keiji', 'Sada', 'English', 'teacher', 'Yoshiko', 'Kuga', 'boys', 'shy', 'aunt', 'who', 'documents', 'translation', 'brothers', '13-year', 'old', 'Koji', 'Shitara', 'Minoru', 'seven-year', 'old', 'Masahiko', 'Shimazu', 'Isamu', 'latter', 'particularly', 'adorable', 'when', 'mimicking', 'older', 'brother', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'class', 'Tokyo', 'Story', 'Floating', 'Weeds', 'doubt', 'Ozu', 'intended', 'be', 'just', 'gentle', 'well-coordinated', 'sometimes', 'hilarious', 'poke', 'Japanese', 'cultural', 'traditions', 'parable', 'masquerading', 'family', 'comedy', 'Personally', 'Ozu', 'film', 'can', 'relate', 'most', 'generation', 'Japanese-born', 'Americans', 'DVD', 'package', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'surprisingly', 'sparse', 'audio', 'commentary', 'trailer', 'video', 'transfer', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'excellent']",N/A

But upon viewing this picture for the first time (just now on TCM-HD) I was astonished to see how extraordinarily similar Japanese life in 1959 was to American life today.  For example, I always thought that the people of Japan respected their elders no matter what, but in this movie, one woman severely chastises her mother for forgetting something (just like you would see in a modern American film) and the boys get away with all sorts of misbehaviors (also just like we see here today).  But as much as this wonderful movie shows us that the more things change the more they stay the same, it also gives us a very enlightening and refreshing look into the lives and homes of generally happy, somewhere near middle class Japanese people during that era. And I am so grateful for that.  It feels like a light was turned on in an area that I knew nothing about, and often wondered about.I have never been a big fan of foreign films.  Too many have been dark, slow, depressing, and just plain confusing.  But I just loved this movie.  It is unique, sweet, colorful, funny, captivating, and makes me want to see more foreign movies like it. Even the music is delightful - a lot of fun, sweet, interesting melodies performed by Orchestra, and sounds very good for the time.I only gave Good Morning 4 stars instead of 5 because the English subtitles are horrible.  I don't just feel, I KNOW that they need to be re-done.  There are WAY too many words and phrases that aren't even good English, and wouldn't make sense in any country.  Other than that, it's perfect, and I highly recommend it.",4,"With correct English subtitles, it would get 5 stars.",1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,1772,"['Perhaps', 'only', 'other', 'Japanese', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'were', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Dreams', 'Miyazaki', 'animated', 'movies', 'amazing', 'quality', 'made', 'fantasy', 'stories', 'viewing', 'picture', 'first', 'time', 'just', 'now', 'TCM-HD', 'was', 'astonished', 'see', 'how', 'extraordinarily', 'similar', 'Japanese', 'life', '1959', 'was', 'American', 'life', 'today', 'example', 'always', 'thought', 'people', 'Japan', 'respected', 'elders', 'matter', 'what', 'movie', 'one', 'woman', 'severely', 'mother', 'forgetting', 'something', 'just', 'would', 'see', 'modern', 'American', 'film', 'boys', 'get', 'away', 'sorts', 'misbehaviors', 'also', 'just', 'see', 'here', 'today', 'as', 'much', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'more', 'things', 'change', 'more', 'stay', 'same', 'also', 'very', 'enlightening', 'refreshing', 'look', 'lives', 'homes', 'generally', 'happy', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'class', 'Japanese', 'people', 'era', 'am', 'so', 'grateful', 'light', 'was', 'turned', 'area', 'knew', 'nothing', 'often', 'wondered', 'about.I', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'foreign', 'films', 'Too', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'dark', 'slow', 'depressing', 'just', 'plain', 'confusing', 'just', 'loved', 'movie', 'unique', 'sweet', 'colorful', 'funny', 'captivating', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'foreign', 'movies', 'Even', 'music', 'delightful', 'lot', 'fun', 'sweet', 'interesting', 'melodies', 'performed', 'Orchestra', 'very', 'good', 'time.I', 'only', 'gave', 'Good', 'Morning', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'English', 'subtitles', 'are', 'horrible', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'feel', 'KNOW', 'need', 'be', 're-done', 'are', 'WAY', 'too', 'many', 'words', 'phrases', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'good', 'English', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'country', 'Other', 'perfect', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
27277,A1B3HGBE9GAI08,0780023307,Jeremy Heilman,"[8, 9]","Set mainly in four homes in a small 1950's Japanese village, Yasujiro Ozu's Good Morning (Ohayo) is an exceptionally wise comedy. It appears outwardly gentle, but hides a great deal of political content. Sure, there are some jokes about bodily functions here, but much of the film's humor comes from the pretense that makes a fart joke a faux pas, not from the flatulence itself. That seems to be Ozu's game. He takes down our defenses by showing us characters that are exceptionally mundane working-class folks, then uses their petty concerns to make broader social commentary. That he seems to think their concerns are petty is a suspicion that occasionally arises, but generally he seems to legitimately care about the characters on display. He takes the camera literally down to the level of a seated character, and his camera looks at them head-on while they speak. He seems to suggest that he's interested in examining these normally unexamined characters, but his stylistic choices could easily be interpreted as condescension. After all, that same focused attention almost feels like a study of these ""common"" people. That he feels compelled to study them so intently suggests he might not quite relate to or understand them.The temptation certainly exists to just read Good Morning as a slice of life tale that shows the foibles of the people in the town, but there may be a bit more to it than that. Although Isamu, the small child who follows his brother throughout the film is adorable, the goal of their protest (they want a television) seems less than noble. Also, Isamu's mimicry appears to be endearing, but isn't it also a tad creepy that he's being led into a strike that he doesn't quite understand? This ambiguity seems to extend to the other characters. Ozu brings up the effects of Japan's mandatory retirement several times during the film. He seems quite critical of the system, as it forces ""retired"" workers to act as door-to-door salespeople that seem to function more as a burden than a service to their customers. Still, when his main adult characters realize their own retirement is impending, they simply shrug it off without any real planning. He doesn't necessarily decry their behavior, but the film almost seems as contemptuous of it as it is of the system that forces the predicament. The film's greatest amount of vitriol is spent condemning the communication gap between generations. Quite simply, the film thinks true communication between generations is impossible. It could be argued that Ozu raises such issues precisely to show that his love for this class of people extends beyond whatever faults they might have. Still, the decision to end many of his scenes the way he does makes the film feel less like a collection of slices of life and more like judgements of that lifestyle. I haven't seen enough of Ozu's to judge his attitudes, but his established reputation as a great cinematic humanist seems somewhat simpleminded. As admittedly funny as it is, Good Morning doesn't seem content to simply giggle at the poor folks, but instead creates a profoundly stated comic view on society.

27283,A1G6KWTPVWLUS7,0780023307,R. Prokop,"[0, 2]","I absolutely love Ozu's movies, and this is the eleventh one I've seen (so far). I regard him as my all-time favorite director in any language. So I feel kind of bad that this is the first of his films that I've decided to review. Maybe I've been just a little too much in awe of his work to comment on ""Late Spring"" or ""Autumn Afternoon"" or any of the others I've watched and re-watched, soaking in every minute of them.So my disappointment at ""Good Morning"" was all the greater, because my expectations had been raised so high. This is in no way a bad film - it may not even deserve to be labeled a mediocre one. But I'm afraid that is indeed my initial reaction, having just finished watching it.First off, the pervasive fart jokes fall utterly flat, and are frankly infantile. I cannot agree with other reviewers here who find deep symbolism in such humor. Even if there were, Ozu could surely have found a dozen different, more effective ways to get his point across.Secondly, I don't like the way the parents ultimately caved in to their children's tantrums by buying a TV set after saying they wouldn't. What kind of message is that? (Although, as a non-TV owner myself, I am perhaps more than a little biased against the outcome. I loved the father's all-too-accurate prediction that television would ""create 100 million idiots"".)I did admire the way Ozu weaved in the sub-theme of the plight of older Japanese, forced into premature retirement and virtual penury, driven to humiliate themselves by becoming door-to-door salesmen and pestering their neighbors. Classic Ozu.The high point of the film for me was the hilarious interaction between the several women involved in a mix-up over the non-payment of dues. But even that scarcely rose above the level of the average American TV sitcom. Ironic that a movie largely critical of television's impact on culture seems to have sunk to its level.But ""Good Morning"" does not change my overall opinion of Yasujiro Ozu as a cinematic genius, worthy of watching even his occasional misfirings.
