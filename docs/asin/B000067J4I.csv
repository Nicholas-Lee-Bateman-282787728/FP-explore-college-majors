Despite its occasional pacing problems and some awkward line readings, the film's heart and the director's loving attention to the way people look and don't look at each other, shine through.  I was surprised at how accessible and sympathetic the story was.  Although I've never had a relationship of this sort, the idea has always fascinated me.  There were moments when I could feel the filmmakers pushing the boundaries of what we will accept in our entertainment, but they never crossed that line.  They never exploited the sensitive subject matter -- or either of the romantic leads -- to produce a political statement about taboos or societal norms.  Perhaps most appealing to me was the naturalistic acting style (Eban and Charley and some of the supporting characters seemed like they were selected off the street one weekend and started filming the next).  There are moments of protracted silence during which the story moves forward only through the interplay between Eban and Charley's eyes.  And what beautiful eyes they are.  Terrific casting, with all the needed chemistry that ensues.  Restrained, careful, and provocative.  Highly recommended.",4,Eye contact has never been so cinematic,1028246400,"08 2, 2002",2002,1188,"['What', 'lovely', 'film', 'occasional', 'pacing', 'problems', 'awkward', 'line', 'readings', 'film', 'heart', 'director', 'loving', 'attention', 'way', 'people', 'look', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'other', 'shine', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'accessible', 'sympathetic', 'story', 'was', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'relationship', 'sort', 'idea', 'always', 'fascinated', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'could', 'feel', 'filmmakers', 'pushing', 'boundaries', 'what', 'will', 'accept', 'entertainment', 'never', 'crossed', 'line', 'never', 'exploited', 'sensitive', 'subject', 'matter', 'romantic', 'leads', 'produce', 'political', 'statement', 'taboos', 'societal', 'norms', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'appealing', 'was', 'naturalistic', 'acting', 'style', 'Eban', 'Charley', 'supporting', 'characters', 'seemed', 'were', 'selected', 'off', 'street', 'one', 'weekend', 'started', 'filming', 'next', 'are', 'moments', 'protracted', 'silence', 'story', 'forward', 'only', 'interplay', 'Eban', 'Charley', 'eyes', 'what', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'are', 'Terrific', 'casting', 'needed', 'chemistry', 'Restrained', 'careful', 'provocative', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
703559,AOQLO5AHYBNZL,B000067J4I,AnimalLuVer,"[6, 38]","Why am I so angry?  The filmmakers demand the viewer feel overwhelming sympathy for a recitivist serial pedophile!  Regardless the sexual orientation, Eban is a child rapist and my concern can only be for his victims.  Unless he's actively seeking help with his disease, I refuse to attempt to offer empathy.  Were he seeking help, I might be interested in his struggle to keep his ""demons"" from drawing his back into his pattern of destroying the lives of future adults, and maybe even be willing to consider all the ""poor me"" crap about what contributed to the sexual predator becoming so damaged that he has made a career of committing psychological murder of kids for no more than a ""fix"" for his addiction.  Be clear, matters not whether it's man on boy, man on girl, or man on puppy for all I care, it's indefensible and this filmmaker's dragged out effort to support it is loathesome.Sadly, that's no all that's wrong with this movie.From the moment you press ""play"" on this title you should begin watching another movie on another TV -- like watching two football games at once.  You will need something to do for the first five minutes while nothing happens -- nothing of any consequence whatever.  They should have simply shown the old couple (Eban's parents) in their living room with the Christmas tree then had Eban open the door with his key and his mom say something like ""glad you could pry yourself away from Seattle long enough to spend some time with your mother."" while Eban carries his luggage in.Too heavyhanded was the relationship between Charlie and his father.  The attempt to make the joke about Seattle's addiction to coffee shops fell flat with this viewer because I felt that despite his few recent years there, back in this town where he was born and raised, he'd have known full well none of it's shops served up a latte.YET, I wish more stories this long were told using so few characters.  Unfortunately, most movies have gigantic budgets and scores of relatives of the investors, director, producers, and actors who MUST be given speaking roles regardless the lack of necessity.  I will point out that the girlfriend of Charlie's dad character was entirely superfluous.I immediately assumed Eban would target the deaf boy -- not PC, but that describes the lad -- only to see he actually eyed and raped the other boy.  Clearly I don't have the instincts to be a ""successful"" predator, which is just fine with me.I can't be the only viewer who wonders how the boy was able to walk up to Eban's first floor bedroom window when the house from outside didn't look wide or long enough except for its bedrooms to be upstairs, plus, I thought Eban took his bags upstairs.  Alas, the flick was far too detestable for me to go back and see that scene again -- and it was within that boring opening of the movie anyway.By the way, where were Eban's folks when he was in their house raping the child?  Does his mom work?  Old as his dad looks, is he not retired?  Details like that should have been worked out rather than the long train and cab rides, which connected up with absolutely nothing.On a POSITIVE note -- buy yourself a copy of COME UNDONE, an excellent movie about two young lads of the same age dealing with their humanity and sexuality.  It's a gay-themed movie that reaches far beyond that in many ways, I think.  I reject the notion that ""Eban"" is in that genre -- Eban is a ""Rape the Child"" GENRE flick and it would be no matter what the sexual organs of the two parties were.",1,Tries To Justify The Rape Of Children,1139529600,"02 10, 2006",2006,3517,"['Why', 'am', 'so', 'angry', 'filmmakers', 'demand', 'viewer', 'feel', 'overwhelming', 'sympathy', 'recitivist', 'serial', 'pedophile', 'Regardless', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'Eban', 'child', 'rapist', 'concern', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'victims', 'actively', 'seeking', 'help', 'disease', 'refuse', 'attempt', 'offer', 'empathy', 'Were', 'seeking', 'help', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'struggle', 'keep', 'demons', 'drawing', 'back', 'pattern', 'destroying', 'lives', 'future', 'adults', 'maybe', 'even', 'be', 'willing', 'consider', 'poor', 'crap', 'what', 'contributed', 'sexual', 'predator', 'becoming', 'so', 'damaged', 'made', 'career', 'committing', 'psychological', 'murder', 'kids', 'more', 'fix', 'addiction', 'Be', 'clear', 'matters', 'not', 'man', 'boy', 'man', 'girl', 'man', 'puppy', 'care', 'indefensible', 'filmmaker', 'dragged', 'out', 'effort', 'support', 'loathesome.Sadly', 'wrong', 'moment', 'press', 'play', 'title', 'should', 'begin', 'watching', 'movie', 'TV', 'watching', 'two', 'football', 'games', 'once', 'will', 'need', 'something', 'do', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'nothing', 'happens', 'nothing', 'consequence', 'should', 'have', 'simply', 'shown', 'old', 'couple', 'Eban', 'parents', 'living', 'room', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'then', 'had', 'Eban', 'open', 'door', 'key', 'mom', 'say', 'something', 'glad', 'could', 'pry', 'away', 'Seattle', 'long', 'enough', 'spend', 'time', 'mother', 'Eban', 'luggage', 'in.Too', 'heavyhanded', 'was', 'relationship', 'Charlie', 'father', 'attempt', 'make', 'joke', 'Seattle', 'addiction', 'coffee', 'shops', 'fell', 'flat', 'viewer', 'felt', 'few', 'recent', 'years', 'there', 'back', 'town', 'where', 'was', 'born', 'raised', ""'d"", 'have', 'known', 'full', 'well', 'none', 'shops', 'served', 'up', 'latte.YET', 'wish', 'more', 'stories', 'long', 'were', 'told', 'using', 'so', 'few', 'characters', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'movies', 'have', 'gigantic', 'budgets', 'scores', 'relatives', 'investors', 'director', 'producers', 'actors', 'who', 'MUST', 'be', 'given', 'speaking', 'roles', 'regardless', 'lack', 'necessity', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'Charlie', 'dad', 'character', 'was', 'entirely', 'superfluous.I', 'immediately', 'assumed', 'Eban', 'would', 'target', 'deaf', 'boy', 'not', 'PC', 'lad', 'only', 'see', 'actually', 'eyed', 'raped', 'other', 'boy', 'Clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'instincts', 'be', 'successful', 'predator', 'just', 'fine', 'me.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'only', 'viewer', 'who', 'how', 'boy', 'was', 'able', 'walk', 'Eban', 'first', 'floor', 'bedroom', 'window', 'when', 'house', 'outside', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'wide', 'long', 'enough', 'bedrooms', 'be', 'upstairs', 'thought', 'Eban', 'took', 'bags', 'upstairs', 'Alas', 'flick', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'detestable', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'scene', 'again', 'was', 'boring', 'opening', 'movie', 'way', 'where', 'were', 'Eban', 'folks', 'when', 'was', 'house', 'raping', 'child', 'mom', 'work', 'Old', 'dad', 'looks', 'not', 'retired', 'Details', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'worked', 'out', 'rather', 'long', 'train', 'cab', 'rides', 'connected', 'up', 'absolutely', 'POSITIVE', 'note', 'buy', 'copy', 'COME', 'UNDONE', 'excellent', 'movie', 'two', 'young', 'lads', 'same', 'age', 'dealing', 'humanity', 'sexuality', 'gay-themed', 'movie', 'far', 'many', 'ways', 'think', 'reject', 'notion', 'Eban', 'genre', 'Eban', 'Rape', 'Child', 'GENRE', 'flick', 'would', 'be', 'matter', 'what', 'sexual', 'organs', 'two', 'parties', 'were']",N/A
703560,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B000067J4I,Arcadio Bolaos,"[1, 4]","Eban and Charley (2000) Although at first glance one might consider this a gay romance spiced with the controversy of age difference, James Bolton's film is mainly a reinterpretation of parental issues that pertain to any gay or straight dynamic.Eban is a 29 year old man, unemployed, uncertain of his future and with no other choice but to live with his parents. Parents who not so delicately ask him to respect his curfew, to go to bed early, etc. Charley is just a 15 year old kid who has a somewhat precarious relationship with his father. As soon as they meet, one could reason that they must first resolve their parental issues before trying to consolidate their passionate relationship.The characters, however, are not entirely aware of the importance of fatherly figures in their lives. That's up for the viewer to discern and interpret, a task that is much easier in Bolton's recent filmDream Boy.Both characters are longing for freedom. But in order to reach freedom a sacrifice must be made. It has been discussed in psychoanalytic theory the importance of independency. Every young man, at some point in his life, craves for freedom. In many cases getting a job can secure financial independency and thus leaving home for good becomes a real possibility. But there is no such thing as being free as the wind. A new shackle replaces the old one. The young man must thrive at the cost of his own hard work, money after all doesn't grow in trees. He is free from his parents but he's now in a new type of confinement. How he deals and resolves this apparent paradox will help him to achieve adulthood.Sacrifice can also be understood as leaving something behind. Something deemed precious or essential. That is why traditional psychoanalytic theory associates sacrifice with castration. It's all about leaving something behind. In some cases, in some cultures, this takes upon a most literal meaning: what is circumcision after all? Isn't it a symbolic castration? Isn't it leaving something behind, leaving part of the penis behind, the same penis that Freud appointed as phallus? Lacan however renounces this Freudian interpretation. For Lacan castration is never a negative process, it's the only way in which the individual can be successfully inserted in the symbolic order. If castration does not take place then the individual turns psychotic. Castration for Lacan means to enter into the symbolic order, and that means to enter into language. Human language is the required castration before any individual can become a part of society.Nonetheless, what can be said about sacrifice and castration regarding Eban and Charley? Well, there are at least two things I feel confident enough to explain. ""Laws are stupid"" says Charley when confronted with the possibility of Eban being accused of pedophilia. Laws are stupid. Laws are castrating indeed. When Charley says ""I don't think age should matter if you love someone"" he inadvertently relies on an Aristotelian conception of the Supreme Good. According to Aristotle, to obey the law means to feel good (doing the right thing makes you feel good); this a Greek paradigm that Socrates upholds even when it means his own demise (in Plato's dialog about the laws Socrates explains why he must face the death penalty instead of running away, because to obey the law is the only way to preserve the polis, and thus to reinforce the Greek culture). Kant, on the other hand, affirms that obeying the law is painful and it must be so. To obey the law, according to Kant, means to experience a narcissistic diminishment. By obeying the law I understand that I'm just one man, that I'm not the center of the universe, that there are things I must obey although I don't agree with them.Of course, we no longer live in Classic Greece. We live in a post-Kantian world. Now the only alternative is to follow Charley's reasoning: age shouldn't be a concern because it's no longer required to support a law which neither of them can respect. What fascinates me about Bolton's film is how he handles pedophilia, probably one of the most controversial subjects, and how he turns this relationship into a metaphor of sacrifice, castrating parents and conceptions of Aristotelian and Kantian law.",3,Symbolic castration and fatherly figures in an intergenerational love story,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,4243,"['Eban', 'Charley', '2000', 'first', 'glance', 'one', 'might', 'consider', 'gay', 'romance', 'spiced', 'controversy', 'age', 'difference', 'James', 'Bolton', 'film', 'mainly', 'reinterpretation', 'parental', 'issues', 'pertain', 'gay', 'straight', 'dynamic.Eban', '29', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'unemployed', 'uncertain', 'future', 'other', 'choice', 'live', 'parents', 'Parents', 'who', 'not', 'so', 'delicately', 'ask', 'respect', 'curfew', 'go', 'bed', 'early', 'etc', 'Charley', 'just', '15', 'year', 'old', 'kid', 'who', 'somewhat', 'precarious', 'relationship', 'father', 'As', 'soon', 'meet', 'one', 'could', 'reason', 'must', 'first', 'resolve', 'parental', 'issues', 'trying', 'consolidate', 'passionate', 'relationship.The', 'characters', 'however', 'are', 'not', 'entirely', 'aware', 'importance', 'fatherly', 'figures', 'lives', 'up', 'viewer', 'discern', 'interpret', 'task', 'much', 'easier', 'Bolton', 'recent', 'filmDream', 'Boy.Both', 'characters', 'are', 'longing', 'freedom', 'order', 'reach', 'freedom', 'sacrifice', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'been', 'discussed', 'psychoanalytic', 'theory', 'importance', 'independency', 'young', 'man', 'point', 'life', 'craves', 'freedom', 'many', 'cases', 'getting', 'job', 'can', 'secure', 'financial', 'independency', 'thus', 'leaving', 'home', 'good', 'becomes', 'real', 'possibility', 'such', 'thing', 'being', 'free', 'wind', 'new', 'shackle', 'old', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'must', 'thrive', 'cost', 'own', 'hard', 'work', 'money', ""n't"", 'grow', 'trees', 'free', 'parents', 'now', 'new', 'type', 'confinement', 'How', 'apparent', 'paradox', 'will', 'help', 'achieve', 'adulthood.Sacrifice', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'understood', 'leaving', 'something', 'Something', 'deemed', 'precious', 'essential', 'why', 'traditional', 'psychoanalytic', 'theory', 'associates', 'sacrifice', 'castration', 'leaving', 'something', 'cases', 'cultures', 'most', 'literal', 'meaning', 'what', 'circumcision', ""n't"", 'symbolic', 'castration', ""n't"", 'leaving', 'something', 'leaving', 'part', 'penis', 'same', 'penis', 'Freud', 'appointed', 'phallus', 'Lacan', 'however', 'Freudian', 'interpretation', 'Lacan', 'castration', 'never', 'negative', 'process', 'only', 'way', 'individual', 'can', 'be', 'successfully', 'inserted', 'symbolic', 'order', 'castration', 'not', 'take', 'place', 'then', 'individual', 'psychotic', 'Castration', 'Lacan', 'means', 'enter', 'symbolic', 'order', 'enter', 'language', 'Human', 'language', 'required', 'castration', 'individual', 'can', 'become', 'part', 'society.Nonetheless', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'sacrifice', 'castration', 'regarding', 'Eban', 'Charley', 'Well', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'things', 'feel', 'confident', 'enough', 'explain', 'Laws', 'are', 'stupid', 'Charley', 'when', 'confronted', 'possibility', 'Eban', 'being', 'accused', 'pedophilia', 'Laws', 'are', 'stupid', 'Laws', 'are', 'castrating', 'indeed', 'When', 'Charley', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'age', 'should', 'matter', 'love', 'someone', 'inadvertently', 'Aristotelian', 'conception', 'Supreme', 'Good', 'According', 'Aristotle', 'obey', 'law', 'feel', 'good', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'feel', 'good', 'Greek', 'paradigm', 'upholds', 'even', 'when', 'own', 'demise', 'Plato', 'dialog', 'laws', 'Socrates', 'why', 'must', 'face', 'death', 'penalty', 'instead', 'running', 'away', 'obey', 'law', 'only', 'way', 'preserve', 'polis', 'thus', 'reinforce', 'Greek', 'culture', 'Kant', 'other', 'hand', 'affirms', 'obeying', 'law', 'painful', 'must', 'be', 'so', 'obey', 'law', 'according', 'Kant', 'experience', 'narcissistic', 'diminishment', 'obeying', 'law', 'understand', ""'m"", 'just', 'one', 'man', ""'m"", 'not', 'center', 'universe', 'are', 'things', 'must', 'obey', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'them.Of', 'course', 'no', 'longer', 'live', 'Classic', 'Greece', 'live', 'post-Kantian', 'world', 'Now', 'only', 'alternative', 'follow', 'Charley', 'reasoning', 'age', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'concern', 'no', 'longer', 'required', 'support', 'law', 'can', 'respect', 'What', 'Bolton', 'film', 'how', 'pedophilia', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'how', 'relationship', 'metaphor', 'sacrifice', 'castrating', 'parents', 'conceptions', 'Aristotelian', 'Kantian', 'law']",N/A
703561,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B000067J4I,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[3, 5]","As a previous reviewer stated: ""I wanted to like this film, I really did"". I whole heartedly agree, but I found myself a bit disturbed by the execution of the plot. First of all it was not at all believable in a lot of areas. For instance, when Eban approached Charley, (well below his own age), a total stranger he was attracted to, in an empty coffee shop with plenty of other places to sit. Charley allowing him to sit there and not at all acting uncomfortable about the situation, as if they were old friends. Then Eban so boldly following up by stalking the boy the next day and approaching him again. What a deliberate set up! Then when invited to Charley's room with both having wet feet and taking off their shoes and socks, Eban shucks his pants as well, I was left feeling that this situation could not have been totally consentual. There was definately a strong attempt here to seduce a boy who was waiting to experience his first love in the shadows of his mothers death, a rotten relationship with his father and all while dealing with feelings of attraction for the same sex. While this film was slow at best, the relationship progress raced along way too fast to be believable. I suppose the best description of this movie would be about a man with a problem, who can't seem to find the will to battle his demons, so he repeats very recent illegal behavior. He is driven by his lust to seduce a troubled teen male with a lot of demons of his own and looking for a way of escape. The two throw themselves into a frenzied, forbidden relationship which in spite of a script that lacks in several ways, seems to work and has a happy ending right when their relationship is really just starting to take off.I was impressed with the acting of Charley (Giovanni Andrade). Given the script he had to work with, I thought he done an outstanding job. For an independant film, I was not UNimpressed with the photography or audio. I will admit that I didn't hate this film. It was a daring subject, with touching moments, I just felt a little used after watching it. This COULD HAVE BEEN a whole lot better had a whole lot more thought and practical professionalism been placed into making it. A lot of unexplained things and characters. I gave it three stars because there were moments I liked in the film, but I would recommend if you decide to see it, view it with low expectations. If you don't like it, you won't be disappointed. If you do like it, it will be a pleasant surprise. This film was way over rated. This is a classic example of the old saying: ""Don't judge a book (DVD) by it's cover"". The leading characters were not nearly as attractive as made to appear on the jacket, and the story line was not put together well at all. I have to agree with Eban's parents on this one: ""You are a pedophile son""! Love happens sometimes between people with considerable age difference, but there is a difference between falling in love under unusual circumstances, and seducing someone and arranging the situation so they will be more apt to fall in love with you, just so you can satisfy your desires. This film was billed as a story of two people who just by chance fell in love. Not at all the reality of the whole production. I was disappointed with this one.",3,A bit disappointed,1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,3270,"['previous', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'wanted', 'like', 'film', 'really', 'did', 'whole', 'heartedly', 'agree', 'found', 'bit', 'disturbed', 'execution', 'plot', 'First', 'was', 'not', 'believable', 'lot', 'areas', 'instance', 'when', 'Eban', 'approached', 'Charley', 'well', 'own', 'age', 'total', 'stranger', 'was', 'attracted', 'empty', 'coffee', 'shop', 'plenty', 'other', 'places', 'sit', 'Charley', 'allowing', 'sit', 'there', 'not', 'acting', 'uncomfortable', 'situation', 'were', 'old', 'friends', 'Then', 'Eban', 'so', 'boldly', 'following', 'up', 'stalking', 'boy', 'next', 'day', 'approaching', 'again', 'What', 'deliberate', 'set', 'up', 'Then', 'when', 'invited', 'Charley', 'room', 'having', 'wet', 'feet', 'taking', 'off', 'shoes', 'socks', 'Eban', 'pants', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'situation', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'consentual', 'was', 'definately', 'strong', 'attempt', 'here', 'seduce', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'waiting', 'experience', 'first', 'love', 'shadows', 'mothers', 'death', 'rotten', 'relationship', 'father', 'dealing', 'feelings', 'attraction', 'same', 'sex', 'film', 'was', 'slow', 'best', 'relationship', 'progress', 'raced', 'along', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'be', 'believable', 'suppose', 'best', 'description', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'man', 'problem', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'will', 'battle', 'demons', 'very', 'recent', 'illegal', 'behavior', 'driven', 'lust', 'seduce', 'troubled', 'teen', 'male', 'lot', 'demons', 'own', 'looking', 'way', 'escape', 'two', 'throw', 'frenzied', 'forbidden', 'relationship', 'spite', 'script', 'several', 'ways', 'work', 'happy', 'ending', 'right', 'when', 'relationship', 'really', 'just', 'starting', 'take', 'off.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'acting', 'Charley', 'Giovanni', 'Andrade', 'Given', 'script', 'had', 'work', 'thought', 'done', 'outstanding', 'job', 'independant', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'UNimpressed', 'photography', 'audio', 'will', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'film', 'was', 'daring', 'subject', 'touching', 'moments', 'just', 'felt', 'little', 'used', 'watching', 'COULD', 'HAVE', 'BEEN', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'had', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'thought', 'practical', 'professionalism', 'been', 'placed', 'making', 'lot', 'unexplained', 'things', 'characters', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'were', 'moments', 'liked', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'decide', 'see', 'low', 'expectations', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'do', 'will', 'be', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'film', 'was', 'way', 'rated', 'classic', 'example', 'old', 'saying', 'Do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'book', 'DVD', 'cover', 'leading', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'attractive', 'made', 'appear', 'jacket', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'not', 'put', 'together', 'well', 'have', 'agree', 'Eban', 'parents', 'one', 'are', 'pedophile', 'son', 'Love', 'sometimes', 'people', 'considerable', 'age', 'difference', 'difference', 'falling', 'love', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'seducing', 'someone', 'arranging', 'situation', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'apt', 'fall', 'love', 'just', 'can', 'satisfy', 'desires', 'film', 'was', 'billed', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'chance', 'fell', 'love', 'Not', 'reality', 'whole', 'production', 'was', 'disappointed', 'one']",N/A

The next scene has Eban going into a resturant to order a latte; &quot; we only have coffee &quot;.

Next we see Eban riding his bike thru town and joins Charlie near the boardwalk which afterwile Eban asks for a date and Charlie agrees, and watches Eban ride away on his bike ( is there some mutal intrest here ?). On there date they walk on the beach and return to Charlie's room were they undress down to there underwear to let them dry. On the second date they both go bicycling and return again to undress to let their clothes dry but Charlie sits next to Eban and........... sorry can't explain more or I will spoil the movie. I can tell you that a relationship is growing between the two and both parents find out. Charlie's dad is an ex-airforce officer and a real jerk. &quot;take off that s--t&quot; referring to Charlie's fingernail polish and dad holds back money for the mothers insurance, that was meant for his son (she was killed by a drunk driver the previous year). With tensions growing between father and son, Charlie seeks comfort in the arms of Eban all the while avoiding either parent(s). Forced to make a decision, the movies climatic ending is worth seeing. although the the film is not up to hollywoods standards, this doesn't distract from its touching and tender moments. Editing is a bit choppy but I loved this film all the same. Though the subject matter is controversial at best, it shows the flip side of a boy in love with an older man and wanting his company.

703563,A1X1RWRPSAL206,B000067J4I,"interested_observer ""interested_observer""","[7, 9]","While most reviews to-date focus on the author's opinion on adult-adolescent relationships in general or on the romance displayed in ""Eban and Charley"", it might be useful to consider how Eban and Charley managed themselves through the movie.Twenty-nine-year old Eban (played by Brent Fellows), carrying a duffel bag and a guitar, takes a train home (filmed in Seaside, Oregon).  Eban is ostensibly taking his Christmas vacation from his job in Seattle coaching (junior?) high school soccer.  In fact the school had fired him quietly for an inappropriate relationship with a student.  Curiously, the school chose to tell Eban's father (played by Ron Upton), who keeps it to himself for a while.  Eban hangs on to a photo of the student and glances longingly at it from time to time.  Eban does have to remake himself.Riding a bike around town, Eban stops at a CD store where soon-to-be fifteen-year old Charley (played by Giovanni Andrade) is shopping with his deaf-mute friend, Kevin (played by Drew Zeller).  Eban strikes up several conversations with Charley.  They share an interest in guitar playing, drawing, and poetry.  Charley's mother died recently, and his father (played by Nolan V. Chard) is actively dating and seems unsupportive to Charley.  Eban and Charley become friends.  At this point the audience can suspect Eban being a classic ephebephile.Then the dynamic changes.  Charley emerges as the more driven character, the one with the vision.  Eban settles back into a passive role, like the more classic female romance character who first hooks her man and later lets him feel in command.  Charley drives the action forward.  In their tasteful make-out scene, Charley is on top, kissing and groping Eban, who just lies there.A parallel story shows Charley's girl friend Sunshine (played by Ellie Nicholson), who claims people have only one chance at happiness.  She is going to take hers by running away with Kevin.  Charley is very interested in the details.  Are there an ultimate purpose, a destination, economic support, and safety from pursuit?  Charley even gives her some money from the cache his mother left behind to him and which his father wants for bill payments.When Eban and Charley's fathers start actively disapproving, some decisions need making.Should Eban and Charley stop seeing each other?If Eban moved home for good, how would they circumvent family and other resistance?If Charley moved to Seattle, how would Eban support him?  Would Charley have to contribute?  What about Charley's schooling?  What about Eban's former love interest?  What about a future Eban love interest?  What if an official from Eban's former school sees Eban and Charley together?  How many hours would it take for Charley's father to get Eban arrested?If they moved abroad, where to?  What about passports and visas?  What about money?At this point someone has to be the adult.  Charley  presents a vision but now delegates it to Eban to figure out the mechanics.  Big John of ""L.I.E."" could sort it out.  Is Eban up to it?The acting is good, suiting the characters and their ages.  The script is straightforward.  The romance feels dreamy and poetic, while the camera keeps a sharper focus.The movie ends with a hopeful feeling, but isn't it a fool's paradise?",4,Where Angels Fear to Tread,1030579200,"08 29, 2002",2002,3279,"['most', 'reviews', 'to-date', 'focus', 'author', 'opinion', 'adult-adolescent', 'relationships', 'general', 'romance', 'displayed', 'Eban', 'Charley', 'might', 'be', 'useful', 'consider', 'how', 'Eban', 'Charley', 'managed', 'movie.Twenty-nine-year', 'old', 'Eban', 'played', 'Brent', 'Fellows', 'carrying', 'duffel', 'bag', 'guitar', 'train', 'home', 'filmed', 'Seaside', 'Oregon', 'Eban', 'ostensibly', 'taking', 'Christmas', 'vacation', 'job', 'Seattle', 'coaching', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'soccer', 'fact', 'school', 'had', 'fired', 'quietly', 'inappropriate', 'relationship', 'student', 'Curiously', 'school', 'chose', 'tell', 'Eban', 'father', 'played', 'Ron', 'Upton', 'who', 'while', 'Eban', 'hangs', 'photo', 'student', 'glances', 'longingly', 'time', 'time', 'Eban', 'have', 'remake', 'himself.Riding', 'bike', 'town', 'Eban', 'CD', 'store', 'where', 'soon-to-be', 'fifteen-year', 'old', 'Charley', 'played', 'Giovanni', 'Andrade', 'shopping', 'deaf-mute', 'friend', 'Kevin', 'played', 'Drew', 'Zeller', 'Eban', 'up', 'several', 'conversations', 'Charley', 'share', 'interest', 'guitar', 'playing', 'drawing', 'poetry', 'Charley', 'mother', 'died', 'recently', 'father', 'played', 'Nolan', 'V.', 'Chard', 'actively', 'dating', 'unsupportive', 'Charley', 'Eban', 'Charley', 'become', 'friends', 'point', 'audience', 'can', 'suspect', 'Eban', 'being', 'classic', 'ephebephile.Then', 'dynamic', 'changes', 'Charley', 'more', 'driven', 'character', 'one', 'vision', 'Eban', 'back', 'passive', 'role', 'more', 'classic', 'female', 'romance', 'character', 'who', 'first', 'man', 'later', 'lets', 'feel', 'command', 'Charley', 'action', 'forward', 'tasteful', 'make-out', 'scene', 'Charley', 'top', 'kissing', 'groping', 'Eban', 'who', 'just', 'there.A', 'parallel', 'story', 'Charley', 'girl', 'friend', 'Sunshine', 'played', 'Ellie', 'Nicholson', 'who', 'people', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'chance', 'happiness', 'going', 'take', 'hers', 'running', 'away', 'Kevin', 'Charley', 'very', 'interested', 'details', 'Are', 'there', 'ultimate', 'purpose', 'destination', 'economic', 'support', 'safety', 'pursuit', 'Charley', 'even', 'money', 'cache', 'mother', 'left', 'father', 'bill', 'payments.When', 'Eban', 'Charley', 'fathers', 'start', 'actively', 'disapproving', 'decisions', 'need', 'making.Should', 'Eban', 'Charley', 'stop', 'seeing', 'other', 'Eban', 'moved', 'home', 'good', 'how', 'would', 'circumvent', 'family', 'other', 'resistance', 'Charley', 'moved', 'Seattle', 'how', 'would', 'Eban', 'support', 'Would', 'Charley', 'have', 'contribute', 'What', 'Charley', 'schooling', 'What', 'Eban', 'former', 'love', 'interest', 'What', 'future', 'Eban', 'love', 'interest', 'What', 'official', 'Eban', 'former', 'school', 'sees', 'Eban', 'Charley', 'together', 'How', 'many', 'hours', 'would', 'take', 'Charley', 'father', 'get', 'Eban', 'arrested', 'moved', 'abroad', 'where', 'What', 'passports', 'visas', 'What', 'money', 'point', 'someone', 'be', 'adult', 'Charley', 'vision', 'now', 'Eban', 'figure', 'out', 'mechanics', 'Big', 'John', 'L.I.E', 'could', 'sort', 'out', 'Eban', 'up', 'acting', 'good', 'suiting', 'characters', 'ages', 'script', 'straightforward', 'romance', 'feels', 'dreamy', 'poetic', 'camera', 'sharper', 'focus.The', 'movie', 'hopeful', 'feeling', ""n't"", 'fool', 'paradise']",N/A

It seems that recently, a spate of gay movies are dealing with more controversial topics, for example, this movie and L.I.E. However, to just push the envelope does not a good movie make, and that unfortunately is the fate of ""Eban and Charley"".When watching an independent film, you should remember this film comes to us without all of the Hollywood backing and slickness that makes for a major motion picture. ""Eban and Charley"" is a prime example of that, with very simple sets, acting, and filming techniques. The look of this movie is very amateur, digitial camera, but in a way, that lends itself to the honesty of the film. The quietness of the script is exemplified in the filming.However, one cannot look past some major flaws. This movie is slow, and just continues to get slower as it goes on, due to some ineffective editing. In fact, I began to entertain myself trying to see if I could spot boom mikes and camera reflections in windows during the lag. Some of the acting is subpar, and often unbelievable. I didn't buy the attraction between the two leads at all, and if that doesn't work, the film doesn't work. The parents in the movie were rehashed stereotypes, with the exception of one.  The story of the film works, especially the ending, but when you are not buying the picture, the story doesn't matter.Sadly, what could have been interesting ends up mildly mediocre, and a film that's going to be most likely forgotten five minutes after you view it.

To do that would be like saying that ""Silence Of The Lambs"" is a horrible movie because Hannibal Lechter kills people!  That's not a good way to review a movie.This movie tells the story of an immature young man who returns to his parents house under some mysterious circumstances. Soon after arriving, he befriends a teen whose mother has recently passed away. The teen lives with his unloving, cruel father.  It's obvious how the story ultimately unfolds: the teen falls in love with the young man and trouble begins when their respective families find out what's going on.  However, this rather predictable story takes an unpredictable turn.  You don't really want the couple to continue with their relationship because you know it's wrong, yet you sort of do (but with extreme reservations!)This low budget affair seemed like a foreign movie when I first turned it on, but alas, it's not.  No subtitles!  It's in English!  The acting, direction, and writing is all top notch. The movie looks like it was shot directly on to videotape, yet the cinematographer (if there even was one) still manages to convey enough imagery through cold, rainy weather to give you the sort of feeling you need to have when watching a movie like this.  The director tells the story concisely, and wisely avoids any meandering, boring added details that would have just detracted from what is here.  There are too many movies made these days that are just unnecessarily way too long.There are a lot of good gay independent features, and there are a lot of bad ones.  This is one of the good ones, and if you are a fan of gay cinema, you'll probably think it's good. I do hesitate to say that ""you'll enjoy it""... it's not that kind of movie!

Is a 15-year old really capable of giving consent to an intimate relationship with an adult? Should we see Eban as a dangerous predator, or a misunderstood nice guy?

Eban is a 29 teacher who got expelled from a Seattle school for having an affair with a student. Eban returns home to his parent's house in Seaside.Charley is a 15 years old kid who lives in the same town. For not so obvious reasons, he be-friends Eban (which you understand why later). They both develop a relationship which becomes romantic. Charley lives with his father after his mother gets run over by a drunk driver. She was deaf and explains why he sign language (which Eban does too). Charley has a deaf straight friend who has girlfriend (they both runaway at the end of the movie). Charley and Eban also play the guitar.As the relationship further develops by Eban and Charley, they get caught, and both sets of parents learned of the situation. After some hesitation by Eban they both runaway together at the end.I reviewed another movie ""Return to Innocence"" which deals basically with the same subject, pedophiles. Return to Innocence was a more technical movie dealing with professionals in the field of psychiatry. In this movie we have a teacher falling for younger kids, a topic that is now seen more, and more.I believe that true love has no barriers. That is what I would accept. Unfortunately in this story, the older man has done this before, and I am not sure whether the love is genuine. If he has fallen with another boy, what is not to say, that the next cute boy attractive to him, he would dump Charley. This is Charley first love, his heart is very vulnerable, but he comes out as the more matured person at the end. Eban vacillation between his true feelings and fear caused him not to pursue the first relationship. He is going to be true to this next boy?I am willing to accept things in the name of love. As a late romantic, I feel that we all have that soul mate out there. However, you have to be aware of the law, and that this sort behavior is not tolerated in most societies. And I do not think that it makes a difference whether you are heterosexual or homosexual (unlike what another reviewer says). Humans go through many stages of development, and having someone that young, they may not understand the ramifications of a relationship.

Some folks I know are upset about the age difference, like maybe 30 years ago the same was said about a black/white relationship.  Charley is not forced into a relationship and is a 15 year old that makes up his own mind. It's a small indie film, character driven.  That's nice after so many razzle dazzle special effects films.

Pileggi,"[11, 13]","On the one hand, I thought the film was slow, the acting was at times good, at times forced, the story a little too timely, yet not really because there are no clergy involved, the supporting characters too black & white. On the other hand, the film was kind of hypnotic and dreamy, the emotions were fairly real between the two main characters, and the subject, while considered a taboo, was able to provoke a questioning of that taboo. A kind -of -mature 15 yr.old falling in love with a sort of not-so -mature 29yr.old. I believed it in this film. There was an underlying urgency and honesty in the relationship, two apparently damaged people needing what the other has to give. Not as good a piece of cinema as L.I.E., but strong enough to not let you hold onto your preconceived notions about intergenerational romance. There is no actual sex on screen, but there are expressions of emotion with the characters in their underwear that may make some viewers feel uncomfortable. But approach with an open mind. If this were a heterosexual retelling of Lolita, what would the preconceived notions be? Or if Eban was 34 and Charly was 20? I'm glad for films that make people stop and question their own ideas.
