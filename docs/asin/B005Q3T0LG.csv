1497343,A3TIEP0VIAW6UM,B005Q3T0LG,Nancy K. McLain,"[3, 3]","I hit the jackpot when I found Mother was a Freshman, but also Sitting Pretty and The Model and Marriage Broker. It was a triple play!! I think Loretta Young is just an exquisite beauty! Again the story line is a simple one. The movie is just fun to watch especially when in the beginning of the movie you see a very attractive Loretta Young in a matronly look then she goes back to school on a grant that her grandmother had set up years ago. This also allows her daughter to go back to the university. Going back to school Ms. Young seems to blossom into a more confident and easy going beauty. I had a mini marathon of old movies for an entire weekend. The running time of these movies is also a plus. Each of the movies runs about an hour and a half, not too long, not too short.Again the story line is on the surface a simple one, but there are of course the human complications that add their own twist. I think many of these old movies illustrate life lessons such as just because you want something or someone it doesn't mean that it will work out, a person needs periodic reality checks and not live in a dream world, and telling a person the truth is hard because of the possibilities of hurt feelings. In the end honesty is the best policy.",5,old movie fan,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,1251,"['hit', 'jackpot', 'when', 'found', 'Mother', 'was', 'Freshman', 'also', 'Sitting', 'Pretty', 'Model', 'Marriage', 'Broker', 'was', 'triple', 'play', 'think', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'just', 'exquisite', 'beauty', 'Again', 'story', 'line', 'simple', 'one', 'movie', 'just', 'fun', 'watch', 'especially', 'when', 'beginning', 'movie', 'see', 'very', 'attractive', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'matronly', 'look', 'then', 'back', 'school', 'grant', 'grandmother', 'had', 'set', 'up', 'years', 'ago', 'also', 'daughter', 'go', 'back', 'university', 'Going', 'back', 'school', 'Ms.', 'Young', 'blossom', 'more', 'confident', 'easy', 'going', 'beauty', 'had', 'mini', 'marathon', 'old', 'movies', 'entire', 'weekend', 'running', 'time', 'movies', 'also', 'plus', 'movies', 'hour', 'half', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'not', 'too', 'short.Again', 'story', 'line', 'surface', 'simple', 'one', 'are', 'course', 'human', 'complications', 'add', 'own', 'twist', 'think', 'many', 'old', 'movies', 'illustrate', 'life', 'lessons', 'such', 'just', 'want', 'something', 'someone', ""n't"", 'mean', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'person', 'periodic', 'reality', 'checks', 'not', 'live', 'dream', 'world', 'telling', 'person', 'truth', 'hard', 'possibilities', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'end', 'honesty', 'best', 'policy']",Mother Is a Freshman (1949)

Loretta Young is a mom who goes to college for purpose of getting out of financial distress made by her and her daughter. The daughter has a serious crush on the professor of literature and when Mom goes to college and professor falls for Mom.  The daughter in turn starts pulling all kinds of tricks.

1497346,A222UT38AMN0H2,B005Q3T0LG,The reviewer,"[28, 28]","It's 1949 and Loretta Young has to be the most beautiful woman on the planet.  She's also gentle-spoken, lovable, sweet and very stylish.  Van Johnson plays a handsome professor at Pointer College.  The problem is Betty Lynn, who plays Loretta's rather spoiled daughter.  She's developed a crush on Van, who is old enough to be her father.  This leads to complications when Loretta goes back to college to get her hands on some scholarship funding because she and Betty are overdrawn at the bank.Van falls in love with Loretta, not Betty.  Barbara Lawrence is another student with a crush on Van.  He's a very popular professor.  Barbara even flunked his course so she could repeat it.  Meanwhile, Robert Arthur, a handsome young man of the right age, is in love with Betty who treats him badly because she's in love with Van.  And Rudy Vallee is the family lawyer who is in love with Loretta.  Everyone is hopelessly in love with the wrong people!Throughout this romantic tangle, we have the gals all dressed in the latest styles of 1949.  White gloves, hats, gowns, slacks, hair and jewels -- they all look sensational by any standard.  Especially Loretta, who later became known as a fashion plate with her TV show in the 1950s.  In one scene, though, the designer had to be drunk.  Loretta shows up in a gown that looks like it was stitched together from table cloths, but she's gorgeous even in that.This amusing movie has beautiful people, colorful sets, funny twists in the plot, and will put you in a good mood.  You'll spot people in bit parts who later became bigger stars in the 50s, including Jeff Richards, Debra Paget and Kathleen Hughes.",5,You'll Love This Movie,1319241600,"10 22, 2011",2011,1652,"['1949', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'be', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'planet', 'also', 'gentle-spoken', 'lovable', 'sweet', 'very', 'stylish', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'handsome', 'professor', 'Pointer', 'College', 'problem', 'Betty', 'Lynn', 'who', 'Loretta', 'rather', 'spoiled', 'daughter', 'developed', 'crush', 'Van', 'who', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'father', 'complications', 'when', 'Loretta', 'back', 'college', 'get', 'hands', 'scholarship', 'funding', 'Betty', 'are', 'overdrawn', 'bank.Van', 'love', 'Loretta', 'not', 'Betty', 'Barbara', 'Lawrence', 'student', 'crush', 'Van', 'very', 'popular', 'professor', 'Barbara', 'even', 'flunked', 'course', 'could', 'repeat', 'Meanwhile', 'Robert', 'Arthur', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'right', 'age', 'love', 'Betty', 'who', 'treats', 'badly', 'love', 'Van', 'Rudy', 'Vallee', 'family', 'lawyer', 'who', 'love', 'Loretta', 'Everyone', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'wrong', 'people', 'romantic', 'tangle', 'have', 'gals', 'dressed', 'latest', 'styles', '1949', 'White', 'gloves', 'hats', 'gowns', 'slacks', 'hair', 'jewels', 'look', 'sensational', 'standard', 'Especially', 'Loretta', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'known', 'fashion', 'plate', 'TV', 'show', '1950s', 'one', 'scene', 'though', 'designer', 'had', 'be', 'drunk', 'Loretta', 'up', 'gown', 'was', 'stitched', 'together', 'table', 'cloths', 'gorgeous', 'even', 'that.This', 'amusing', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'people', 'colorful', 'sets', 'funny', 'twists', 'plot', 'will', 'put', 'good', 'mood', ""'ll"", 'spot', 'people', 'bit', 'parts', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'bigger', 'stars', '50s', 'including', 'Jeff', 'Richards', 'Debra', 'Paget', 'Kathleen', 'Hughes']",Mother Is a Freshman (1949)
