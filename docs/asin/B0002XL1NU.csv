849097,A2VFBU6CVZ2QUR,B0002XL1NU,Amazon Customer,"[9, 11]","I was pleasantly surprised by this documentary! I rented it on impulse because I'd nothing better to watch and the subject interested me. It's a fairly good overview of the H.H. Holmes story, from Holmes's early years in New Hampshire right through to his execution. What it is not is a thorough investigation which is why I gave it only 4 stars. There were some details lacking and the film, though extremely polished, seemed to have a low-budget quality to it.It's great if you're looking to kill (pardon the pun) an hour and don't know much about one of America's worst serial killers. However, those of you familiar with the Holmes story, don't look for any startling revelations or intense detective work.The format is typical documentary with ""slide shows"" of pictures from that era interspersed with interviews from experts on the subject (although there were only a few of those). The narrator has a stuffy British-y accent which makes the documentary seem more ""official"" somehow. Also there are voice-overs reading some of Holmes's autobiography. There are short dramatizations of Holmes stalking a young frightened woman around a creepy dark house. Again somewhat low-budget but still very entertaining. Be prepared, though, later in the film, there is a dragging part where the narrator is describing Holmes's flights across the country where all you see is a red line bouncing across a map for what seems like 10 minutes.I would have liked to see more of how Holmes's house of horror was built (more plan details) and more on the subsequent police investigation once Holmes was caught. Again, this is more an overview documentary instead of an in-depth analysis. But it was definitely worth the 1.99 rental fee. I would never buy it though unless it was about the same price for the dvd.",4,Pretty good documentary.,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,1800,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'documentary', 'rented', 'impulse', ""'d"", 'nothing', 'better', 'watch', 'subject', 'interested', 'fairly', 'good', 'overview', 'H.H', 'Holmes', 'story', 'Holmes', 'early', 'years', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'right', 'execution', 'What', 'not', 'thorough', 'investigation', 'why', 'gave', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'were', 'details', 'lacking', 'film', 'extremely', 'polished', 'seemed', 'have', 'low-budget', 'quality', 'it.It', 'great', ""'re"", 'looking', 'kill', 'pardon', 'pun', 'hour', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'one', 'America', 'worst', 'serial', 'killers', 'However', 'familiar', 'Holmes', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'startling', 'revelations', 'intense', 'detective', 'work.The', 'format', 'typical', 'documentary', 'slide', 'shows', 'pictures', 'era', 'interspersed', 'interviews', 'experts', 'subject', 'were', 'only', 'few', 'narrator', 'stuffy', 'British-y', 'accent', 'documentary', 'seem', 'more', 'official', 'somehow', 'Also', 'are', 'voice-overs', 'reading', 'Holmes', 'autobiography', 'are', 'short', 'dramatizations', 'Holmes', 'stalking', 'young', 'frightened', 'woman', 'creepy', 'dark', 'house', 'Again', 'somewhat', 'low-budget', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'Be', 'prepared', 'though', 'later', 'film', 'dragging', 'part', 'where', 'narrator', 'describing', 'Holmes', 'flights', 'country', 'where', 'see', 'red', 'line', 'bouncing', 'map', 'what', '10', 'minutes.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'how', 'Holmes', 'house', 'horror', 'was', 'built', 'more', 'plan', 'details', 'more', 'subsequent', 'police', 'investigation', 'once', 'Holmes', 'was', 'caught', 'Again', 'more', 'overview', 'documentary', 'instead', 'in-depth', 'analysis', 'was', 'definitely', 'worth', '1.99', 'rental', 'fee', 'would', 'never', 'buy', 'was', 'same', 'price', 'dvd']",H.H.

This is one of the most cruel killers ive ever seen because he was evil in every aspect of his life. It dosent matter what it was, from swindling to murder. He is a very cold calculating character,not to mention he was brilliant. He built his own chamber of horrors with secret rooms, passageways and acid vats. He lured strangers and friends alike to his chamber of horrors so he could kill them and sell their bodies to mortuaries and sell their bones for profit. He wasnt your typical serial killer - he completed college and recieved degrees and took advantage of everyone in his life for his sick greed and pleasure. Truly a monster.

What motivated Dr. Mudgett aka Dr. H. H. Holmes to do what he did were the same anti-social forces that propel modern psychopaths to commit the crimes they do today. His story is timeless. Societal free riders such as Mudgett prey on the general population and get away with whatever they can until they are ultimately punished for their behavior. The psychopath is not in need of our understanding. What he requires is quarantine. They must be isolated and imprisoned.

HOLMES, is informative and interesting. I was particularly impressed by Holmes' education level (med school grad), and his architectural knowledge: drawing up his own plans for the ""castle"" in which he lived. This, of course, was also where he terminated most of his victims. The interior was a labyrinth of hidden rooms, false doors, and secret passages. One room was equipped w/ gas pipes for easy, clean executions. Then, it was off to the basement / dungeon, where the bodies were immersed in acid, the flesh dissolved, so that Holmes could sell the skeletons to the local university! Holmes was more than just a serial murderer, in that he was also a master con-man, bigamist, and insurance fraud expert. His only mistake came when he ""forgot"" to pay a promised $500 to a man he met in prison. That error cost Holmes dearly, as it led to the investigation that would be his undoing.

849107,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0002XL1NU,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 3]","How angry H. H. Holmes would be if he knew how forgotten he is today.  Here he is, dubbed (inaccurately) ""America's first serial killer,"" a man who may have killed several dozen people (and definitely killed several children), a fiend who built a ""castle"" custom designed to expedite his murderous activities, a medical doctor, a first-rate confidence man, and even quite the ladies' man - and yet few people have ever heard of him today, and he rarely even gets a mention when people start talking about history's most infamous killers.  Frankly, I don't find the man all that interesting - and I'm not entirely sure why.  Given his deeds and my fascination with serial killers, this man should be up there with Ted Bundy, Jack the Ripper, and the Green River Killer for me - but he isn't.  Maybe it's just because he was such a puny, cowardly sort of fellow who wasn't even man enough to do his work up close and personal.  No, this guy relied on gas, poison, and asphyxiation to rob his innocent victims of their lives.  He only grew a pair after the killing was done, chopping up and burning the bodies or, in several cases, stripping them to the bone and selling their skeletons to medical schools.What should make H. H. Holmes interesting is the fact that he really doesn't fit the profile of your typical serial killer.  For one thing, he was highly educated, having received his medical degree from the University of Michigan.  He didn't exactly fly under the radar, either, as he was quite brazen in terms of conning people out of their money and buying things on credit and never paying for them.  Then there is the ""Murder Castle,"" the three-story, 60-room monstrosity he had built in Chicago.  This was no boy next door, and I daresay you would have had a hard time finding any of his neighbors going on about how shocked they are and what a nice man he was once his true nature was revealed.This documentary does an excellent job of following Holmes from his birth as Herman Webster Mudgett in 1861 to his death (by hanging) in 1896.  The most interesting part of the story, of course, is the ""Murder Castle,"" and the narrative goes into some detail as to the manner in which he killed his victims - such as by pumping gas into their sealed rooms or locking them (including one of his wives) in a giant steel vault to die a slow death by asphyxiation - and the postmortem liberties he took with their bodies (his basement boasted two giant furnaces, a stretching rack, pits of acid, a variety of poisons, and a bloody dissection table).  The video also helps explain why he was not suspected of murder much sooner.  First and foremost is the fact that these killings took place in the 1890s, long before the advent of modern forensics and several years before fingerprints were used by police.  There's also the design of his ""castle,"" which allowed for quiet killings in soundproof rooms and the quick removal of the bodies down a specially designed chute to the basement.  Then there is the Chicago World's Fair of 1893.  Holmes rented out rooms in his ""castle"" to visitors, some of whom just never returned home.  They were almost perfect victims because their friends and family back home would have no reason to link their disappearances to Holmes.The documentary takes us through the international news event that was the trial and the defendant's shenanigans in court.  Then we learn how, following the pronouncement of his death sentence, Holmes decided to take credit for all of his crimes and then some, only to recant for the most part on the gallows.

He was an incredibly complex man who perfected the art of manipulation and deception and his lust for blood far surpassed that of his English rival Jack The Ripper.  This documentary by John Borowski is a must have for those who are fascinated by and would like to learn more about the now infamous ""Torture Doctor"".  I also highly recommend this movie for fans of ""Devil In The White City"" as it provides invaluable insight into the man who had just as much drive and ambition to destroy as the architects of Chicago's World's Fair had to create.This film examines the life of Holmes from the start of his life as an abused and tormented child straight through his college years where he pursued his interest in anatomy to his life as a ruthless killer.  John Borowski pays fine attention to every detail to make this film seem as real as possible and to help expose the madness that was Holmes' world.  His passion for film making as well as the film's subject is apparent from the opening sequence.  The narration by the late, great Tony Jay is haunting and the interviews with the before mention Harold Schechter and other experts in the fields of criminology and forensics are compelling and well produced.All in all, this is a wonderful documentary about a murderous mastermind who held America in a state of shock and fear in the late 1800's.

849114,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0002XL1NU,Jeffrey Leach,"[52, 55]","I think it's safe to say that we can separate serial killers into two categories--let's call them ""A"" and ""B""--when discussing their name recognition. Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Richard Speck, Jeffrey Dahmer, Henry Lee Lucas, Jack the Ripper, and Charles Starkweather would definitely fall in the former. Thanks to the media, the public is all too aware of these vicious killers. Numerous books, articles, documentaries, and movies describe their exploits in nauseating detail. The second tier murderers, no less appalling in their capacity to take human lives, would draw mostly blanks if you dropped their names into polite conversation. Albert Fish, Beck and Fernandez, William Bonin, and dozens of others fall into this category. One name that, until recently, also garnered blank stares was Dr. Herman W. Mudgett aka Henry Holmes aka H. H. Holmes. Thanks to a best-selling book entitled ""The Devil in the White City,"" Holmes is finally receiving his due. I haven't read Erik Larson's treatment, but I have read dozens of serial killer compilations over the years. Holmes made the grade in all of them. I decided to reacquaint myself with this monster recently by watching John Borowski's documentary ""H.H. Holmes: America's First Serial Killer.""Borowski's production, which runs a scant sixty-four minutes, gives the viewer everything they ever wanted to know about this notorious butcher. Holmes grew up in New Hampshire in the 1860s and 1870s, a brilliant but troubled child who eventually attended medical school. After running an insurance scam involving stolen cadavers from school, Holmes disappeared for a number of years before popping up again in Chicago in 1885. Then the nightmares began in earnest. He bounced around the city running numerous scams and running up debts before beginning construction on an enormous mansion across the street from a drugstore he owned. An odd structure indeed, this castle, considering that it boasted close to sixty rooms and a most unusual floor plan. Moreover, Holmes continually hired and then fired workers laboring on the building. One reason was to get out of paying for services rendered. Another reason, and a far more ominous one considering what would soon take place in the mansion, was Holmes's fervent desire that no one but himself would now the ins and outs of the building's design. You see, Dr. Holmes had a specific purpose in mind for his new domicile, a purpose that involved trapdoors, slides, and a murder pit in the basement.Over the next four years, Holmes lured dozens upon dozens of women to the castle. Some came to rent rooms from the good doctor, others seeking employment. No one really knows how many women H. H. Holmes killed. It is generally acknowledged what he did with the bodies, however. After dispatching a victim, the murderer would send their body down to the basement where pits full of acid and quicklime ensured that all traces of the corpse would vanish--after he sold the victims' skeletons to medical schools across the country, that is. Holmes's murderous career started to unravel after police arrested him for running a con in St. Louis. While in jail there he swindled famed train robber Marion Hedgepeth, a swindle that came back to bite him later on when Holmes reneged on a promise to pay the criminal money for securing legal assistance. Hedgepeth eventually rolled over on the doctor, reporting to the authorities an insurance scam Holmes planned on running once out of jail. The Pinkerton Detective Agency got involved in the case, and the rest, as they say, is history. The horrors of the Chicago mansion soon came to light, and H. H. Holmes eventually went to the gallows for his terrifying crimes.Whew! Boy, am I leaving a bunch of stuff out! I could go on and on about H.H. Holmes, about his numerous affairs with women, his cons, and his treatment of the Pietzel family. The fact that Borowski managed to stuff this much information about Holmes's activities into sixty minutes is an impressive feat indeed. The documentary looks like something you might see on A&E; or the History Channel. It shows us the pictures of places and people central to the story of Holmes, contains interviews with serial killer experts like Harold Schechter, boasts several black and white reenactments of significant events, and even has Tony Jay doing the narration. If you don't know this guy's name, don't worry; you'll certainly recognize his voice. He's one of Hollywood's premier voiceover talents, having worked on dozens upon dozens of shows, movies, and videogames. Definitely a great choice to tell the creepy story of one of America's worst serial killers! My only problem with the picture is the title. Sorry, but H.H. Holmes wasn't America's first serial killer. Jesse Pomeroy killed numerous victims several years before Holmes was born. Moreover, serial killers existed in Europe long before America became a country. Gilles de Rais and Elizabeth Bathory are just two examples.Extras on the DVD consist of a commentary track with John Borowski, an informative making of featurette, several trailers, and a photo gallery showing how the places involved in Holmes's crimes have changed in the last hundred plus years. Good stuff. So why isn't Holmes as well known as Bundy, Starkweather, Gacy, and the rest? The documentary answers that question indirectly by having to rely on recreations of the crimes. Holmes operated in a time before television and film could capture the crime scene and the trial. Modern Americans need to see the horror, see the killer marching by on their television sets, for it to register. Nonetheless, I think Borowski's documentary does much to elevate Holmes to the ranks of the ""A"" grade serial killers.",4,A monster revealed,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,5741,"['think', 'safe',

It had a four-star rating overall, and many five-star ratings. Yet when my roommate and I watched it the other night, we could barely contain our laughter at how corny the information in the documentary was presented.The documentary didn't have much of a budget, but low-budget films need not appear cheap. This did. It re-used and overused the same photographs of Holmes, Chicago, his ""castle of horror"", to the point where I was wondering why it wasn't simply a radio show. I kept wondering to myself: What was the director trying to show me? They filmed a few dramatizations, and they couldn't have appeared hokier if they had tried. A woman holding a candle in a nightgown, walking around the only hallway they used to depict the inside of the ""castle of horror"", looking disoriented. It was just weird. I certainly didn't get a sense of the horror and terror I think I should have felt.One of the three experts used in the film ended half of his clauses and 3/4 of his sentences with question marks, and that should have been dealt with. It's extremely annoying to listen to someone talk who makes statements sound like questions, and it should never happen in a documentary. It wouldn't have cost an extra dime for Borowski to have given the expert a few tips.To be fair, this documentary did put a face on Holmes and his victims. Holmes wasn't a pleasant fellow. He did some pretty gruesome things. Or maybe he didn't.After being led through gruesome tales (and re-led and re-led), evidence of a torture dungeon in the large ""castle"" Holmes built in Englewood to further his career as a sociopathic killing machine, we're left with a final thought: that Holmes, who at first admitted to several murders, recanted before he died, claiming to have killed only two people. And we'll never know the truth, because it happened too long ago, and just before better technology (like fingerprinting) was used to solve crimes.One problem I had with the DVD is that it contained neither captions nor subtitles, and I continue to be amazed at the amount of media produced with little or no thought given to the needs of the hearing impaired. This is my own personal crusade, as I'm hearing impaired, and find captions or subtitles helpful. Without them, I need to use these:TV Ears. They work extremely well, so I understood everything that was said, but like most hearing impaired people, would rather leave my hearing aid in so that the rest of the world doesn't disappear when I take it out to use the TV Ears. (This problem has nothing to do with how I rated the documentary.)If you've nothing better to do for an hour, this isn't objectionable, but it's not entertaining, and is too often annoying.",2,Didn't communicate the sense of horror it should have,1202083200,"02 4, 2008",2008,2806,"['When', 'first', 'came', 'page', 'write', 'review', 'documentary', 'thought', 'was', 'wrong', 'place', 'had', 'four-star', 'rating', 'overall', 'many', 'five-star', 'ratings', 'Yet', 'when', 'roommate', 'watched', 'other', 'night', 'could', 'barely', 'contain', 'laughter', 'how', 'corny', 'information', 'documentary', 'was', 'presented.The', 'documentary', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'budget', 'low-budget', 'films', 'need', 'not', 'appear', 'cheap', 'did', 're-used', 'overused', 'same', 'photographs', 'Holmes', 'Chicago', 'castle', 'horror', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'wondering', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'simply', 'radio', 'show', 'kept', 'wondering', 'myself', 'What', 'was', 'director', 'trying', 'show', 'filmed', 'few', 'dramatizations', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'appeared', 'hokier', 'had', 'tried', 'woman', 'holding', 'candle', 'nightgown', 'walking', 'only', 'hallway', 'used', 'depict', 'inside', 'castle', 'horror', 'looking', 'disoriented', 'was', 'just', 'weird', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'horror', 'terror', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'felt.One', 'three', 'experts', 'used', 'film', 'ended', 'half', 'clauses', '3/4', 'sentences', 'question', 'marks', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'dealt', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'listen', 'someone', 'talk', 'who', 'statements', 'questions', 'should', 'never', 'happen', 'documentary', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'cost', 'extra', 'dime', 'Borowski', 'have', 'given', 'expert', 'few', 'tips.To', 'be', 'fair', 'documentary', 'did', 'put', 'face', 'Holmes', 'victims', 'Holmes', 'was', ""n't"", 'pleasant', 'fellow', 'did', 'pretty', 'gruesome', 'things', 'maybe', ""didn't.After"", 'being', 'led', 'gruesome', 'tales', 're-led', 're-led', 'evidence', 'torture', 'dungeon', 'large', 'castle', 'Holmes', 'built', 'Englewood', 'further', 'career', 'sociopathic', 'killing', 'machine', ""'re"", 'left', 'final', 'thought', 'Holmes', 'who', 'first', 'admitted', 'several', 'murders', 'recanted', 'died', 'claiming', 'have', 'killed', 'only', 'two', 'people', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'truth', 'happened', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'just', 'before', 'better', 'technology', 'fingerprinting', 'was', 'used', 'solve', 'crimes.One', 'problem', 'had', 'DVD', 'contained', 'captions', 'subtitles', 'continue', 'be', 'amazed', 'amount', 'media', 'produced', 'little', 'thought', 'given', 'needs', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'own', 'personal', 'crusade', ""'m"", 'hearing', 'impaired', 'find', 'captions', 'subtitles', 'helpful', 'need', 'use', 'TV', 'Ears', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', 'understood', 'everything', 'was', 'said', 'most', 'hearing', 'impaired', 'people', 'would', 'rather', 'leave', 'hearing', 'aid', 'so', 'rest', 'world', ""n't"", 'disappear', 'when', 'take', 'use', 'TV', 'Ears', 'problem', 'nothing', 'do', 'how', 'rated', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'hour', ""n't"", 'objectionable', 'not', 'entertaining', 'too', 'often', 'annoying']",H.H.

Holmes.  I eagerly rented it, hoping for more tidbits about Holmes.If you aren't familiar with the story, the main thing to know is that this Holmes character was first a great con artist who constructed, in 1890's Chicago, a huge three story building housing businesses on the first floor, rental rooms on the third, and apparently a maze of ""killing rooms"" and ""torture rooms"" on the 2nd floor, where he may have killed 50-100 people, mostly visitors to the Chicago World's Fair.  This documentary serves a rudimentary introduction to this story...but the book gives far better details.The documentary has some advantages...mostly the photos:  we see photos of Holmes and some of his assciates and victims.  We see some of the locations where key events took place.But the disadvantages are pretty huge:  there are lots of cheesy shots of a very poor theatrical set serving as a hallway in the ""murder castle.""  Various actors wander around it looking confused or scared, while underneath the voice of the narrator tells us more about Holmes.  THere are also very tedious shots of a map of the US with a superimposed stock video of a steam locomotive...indicating that Holmes was traveling.  I certainly understand that there isn't a lot of archival footage from 1893, but these poorly conceived substitutes give the whole thing a cheesy feeling and are sometimes laughable.  Also, the documentary does have some commentary from ""experts"" who include a couple of odd-fellows, one of whom wrote a book called ""Depravity"" about Holmes and others.  He is clearly a guy who has no problem stating his opinions about Holmes as fact, and this video in turn lets us take them as fact.  But worst of all, the video also takes some of Holmes' own writings about his childhood as fact...these tidbits are drawn for the autobiography Holmes wrote while in prison...trying to win public sympathy.  He was a proven liar of the first order, and yet the film takes his descriptions as fact, offering no supporting information.  This is dangerous.I can only recommend the video to someone who is intriqued by Holmes and wants a sketchy idea of who he was in one hour flat. But for a worthwhile study of this man and the times that made his deeds possible...start with THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY...which also beautifully educates about the Chicago World's Fair, one of this country's most amazing accomplishments.If the subject matter of H.H.

Borowski capitalized on the renewed popularity of ""America's first serial killer"" (a claim which has been long disproven, though it makes a catchy subtitle) and made this fun little doco.While there's nothing terribly new here for the serial killer fan, it's certainly got the kind of low-budget charm one expects from, say, a History Channel special on any given subject; Tony Jay's narration is well beyond eerie into over-the-top silliness, and the few special effects to be found (mostly in the form of fog, fog, and more fog) are laid on with a rusty trowel. Borowski balances reenactments of the original events with interviews with criminal researchers (including the everpresent Harold Schechter, the Ann Rule of the serious serial killer fan), coming up with what looks like, well, a History Channel special more than anything.

Holmes was a frightening man who killed, slaughtered, dismembered humans and sold their skeletons for profit. He was truly a genius at manipulating poor men like Benjamin Pitezel and his family who were his greatest casualties. He was the first serial killer to become so notorious by the end of one century on par with England's Jack the Ripper.",5,"Creepy, thrilling, and frightening!",1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,804,"['watched', 'last', 'night', 'new', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'John', 'Borowski', 'somebody', 'watch', 'out', 'coumentary', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'thriller', 'films', 'great', 'narration', 'commentary', 'Harold', 'Schechter', 'who', 'wrote', 'depraved', 'Dr.', 'H.', 'Holmes', 'born', 'Herman', 'Mudgett', 'criminal', 'profiler', 'blonde', 'Chris', 'Parnell', 'forensics', 'person', 'quite', 'vague', 'lack', 'forensics', 'science', 'time', 'Dr.', 'H.', 'Holmes', 'was', 'frightening', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'slaughtered', 'dismembered', 'humans', 'sold', 'skeletons', 'profit', 'was', 'truly', 'genius', 'manipulating', 'poor', 'men', 'Benjamin', 'Pitezel', 'family', 'who', 'were', 'greatest', 'casualties', 'was', 'first', 'serial', 'killer', 'become', 'so', 'notorious', 'end', 'one', 'century', 'par', 'England', 'Jack', 'Ripper']",H.H.

There's a book entitled Psycho USA that covers this point.  He was a highly intelligent master murderer, though.  Worse than Jack the Ripper by far.This documentary is a nice intro  to this serial killer, but you really have to read the books written about him (and by him) to get a clear picture of this monster.  Try The Strange Case of Dr. H.H. Holmes or Depraved, for example.  Here for a good price on Amazon.The film is worth watching to whet your appetite to learn more.  DO NOT BUY.
