The story, the acting, the music, the plot, the fights, the cliches - EVERYTHING!  The only good things about this film are the sexy females in here.  If they were not in it, it would have been even harder to watch.  Fazon Love was the only good actor in the film and HE was the ONLY one funny in the film!  If he had not been in it, this film would have been even worse.  He is the only one who took his role seriously regardless of the poor production.As many people point out about men (black ones in particular) dressing up like women being a part of a plot and designed to get people used to homosexuality and cross-dressing - I believe it!  I also believe that if some want a career in Hollywood, they must do things like this or be gone.  I also saw evidence of what they call child programming as Fazon Love wore his headphones as Mickey Mouse ears at the end of the film.  I am wearing DJ headphones as I type and I can tell you that it is hard to get those things in that position by accident.  It really seems what they say about Disney is true and about Hollywood in general!As a film, this was poorly written, very poorly directed (it seemed homemade) and the acting seem more like rehearsals or auditions!  I TRULY hope that they do not make another one, but since this one made a profit, I am sure that they will.  To me, Big Mamma seems more like a cartoon or horror character than a comedy!  Big Mamma looks scary and the tacky wig has to go.  Why does it wear the same dress in every film?

After Malcom's (Lawrence) aspiring rapper step son Trent (Jackson) sees a murder it's up to Malcolm to hide Trent and find the evidence he needs to put the murderer in jail.  There is only one way to complete this...become Big Momma again.  After watching the first two I was actually kind of looking forward to this one. The first one was a good movie, but I thought the second one was funnier.  This one took all that was funny about the first two and replaced it with ""High School Musical"" aspects.  A lot of choreographed dance sequences and a lot of singing, not what I expected to see in this movie.  Although there were a few funny parts, the movie was a re-hash of the same jokes from the first two, but not as funny.  This is a perfect example of Hollywood running out of ideas and only doing re-makes, turning TV shows into movies, prequels and sequals that don't need to be made.  After a five year break another sequal to Big Momma didn't seem to be needed, and after watching this it only made that fact more clear.  Overall this movie does for the Big Momma series what ""Batman & Robin"" did to the ""Batman"" series, or what ""Rocky 5"" did to the ""Rocky"" series.  Makes you think...why didn't they stop at the last one? I give it a C-.Would I watch again? - No way, but like the other series I mentioned I would watch the others before this one if they were on TV.*Also try - Big Mommas House 1 & 2",2,All the funny parts from first two are replaced by High School Musical-like singing and dancing.
