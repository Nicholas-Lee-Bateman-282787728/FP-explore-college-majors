Albeit, most of those reviews suggest that viewers had extremely low expectations. This movie is well packaged garbage, though. The tone of the film is extremely, mindlessly negative, and I was repulsed by the suggestion that I might receive a vicarious thrill at the repulsive mass murder of innocent people.If only the script had ANYTHING mature and thoughtful to say. A talented writer could have made a real statement about the anger, paranoia, and alienation growing in this country, but no...nothing intelligent here. The characters are all one-dimensional and the plot is little more than a set-up for 45 minutes of mindless, and preposterous, carnage. Dimwitted, stunted sociopaths may get a thrill out of this idiocy, but count me out. I was tempted to give this two stars instead of one because the direction is competent and the actors do their best with the meager, unintelligent material the have to work with, but no...I can't.",1,Senseless violence for the video game generation,1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,1038,"[""'m"", 'amazed', 'overwhelmingly', 'positive', 'reviews', 'movie', 'received', 'amazon', 'netflix', 'Albeit', 'most', 'reviews', 'suggest', 'viewers', 'had', 'extremely', 'low', 'expectations', 'movie', 'well', 'packaged', 'garbage', 'though', 'tone', 'film', 'extremely', 'mindlessly', 'negative', 'was', 'repulsed', 'suggestion', 'might', 'receive', 'vicarious', 'thrill', 'repulsive', 'mass', 'murder', 'innocent', 'people.If', 'only', 'script', 'had', 'ANYTHING', 'mature', 'thoughtful', 'say', 'talented', 'writer', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'real', 'statement', 'anger', 'paranoia', 'alienation', 'growing', 'country', 'nothing', 'intelligent', 'here', 'characters', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'plot', 'little', 'more', 'set-up', '45', 'minutes', 'mindless', 'preposterous', 'carnage', 'Dimwitted', 'stunted', 'sociopaths', 'may', 'get', 'thrill', 'idiocy', 'count', 'was', 'tempted', 'give', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'direction', 'competent', 'actors', 'do', 'best', 'meager', 'unintelligent', 'material', 'have', 'work', 'ca', ""n't""]",N/A
1337379,A1VWWTCCFU8EVQ,B003DLTBVW,A Customer,"[0, 0]","Director Uwe Boll has made a better film here than he did with SEED. Uwe wrote, produced and directed this Canadian based film. Brendan Fletcher is an example of excellent casting, to be honest all the cast are good. The scenes that include dialogue are directed in a realistic manner which stands out for me, people do talk over one another as they do in real life and it's good to see this on screen. Unfortunately there are too many repeated quick flash forwards of what's to come early on which is unnecessary. Perhaps a less obvious film title would have attracted a wider film audience. There needed to be more  frustrating scenarios at the beginning to give the story depth. I like it when insane, damaged or evil characters are portrayed as articulate and charismatic individuals and Fletcher's character is exactly that.Rampage had an opportunity of being a better film than Falling Down (1993)because there are a couple of bad customer service situations that we have all experienced and Rampage could have improved if there were more of them. The reasons behind the actual rampage are relevant for society in 2012, it's also refreshing the reasons behind the extreme events have nothing to do with religion or terrorist connection.Surprisingly for Uwe no children were portrayed in this film or used as victims, so he must be getting softer when filming violence. Nevertheless, the rampage itself is hard hitting, not because of what's on screen but because it reminds us that we are watching and reading about more random shootings on the news. So the mix of this film with real life knowledge makes for an unsettling experience. The ending is a risk that is both brave and different to what other directors would have done. I'm not a big fan of Uwe Boll and I'm reluctant to write that this film does have some unique moments. When Brendan Fletcher's character is interacting with others, it is clear the dialogue is well written because it's feels natural. Brendan is almost in every scene and he holds the film together very well.Rampage is a step in the right direction for Uwe Boll because the story flows at a good pace and is consistent. However, something did not fit into place during the rampage scenes and I couldn't put my finger on it until after the film had finished... I could not 100% believe the character responsible on screen could deliver such a trail of death and terror, nor did I think the lead up to the terrible events were a dramatically strong enough reason for the subsequent chaos ...which is probably the exact thought that goes through the minds of people in real life that have survived such a terrible ordeal or have lost dear ones from random acts of pure evil.bleedingcriticbleedingfilms.com",3,bleedingfilms.com review of 'RAMPAGE',1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,2739,"['Director', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'made', 'better', 'film', 'here', 'did', 'SEED', 'Uwe', 'wrote', 'produced', 'directed', 'Canadian', 'based', 'film', 'Brendan', 'Fletcher', 'example', 'excellent', 'casting', 'be', 'honest', 'cast', 'are', 'good', 'scenes', 'include', 'dialogue', 'are', 'directed', 'realistic', 'manner', 'out', 'people', 'do', 'talk', 'one', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'good', 'see', 'screen', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'repeated', 'quick', 'flash', 'forwards', 'what', 'come', 'early', 'unnecessary', 'Perhaps', 'less', 'obvious', 'film', 'title', 'would', 'have', 'attracted', 'wider', 'film', 'audience', 'needed', 'be', 'more', 'frustrating', 'scenarios', 'beginning', 'give', 'story', 'depth', 'like', 'when', 'insane', 'damaged', 'evil', 'characters', 'are', 'portrayed', 'articulate', 'charismatic', 'individuals', 'Fletcher', 'character', 'exactly', 'that.Rampage', 'had', 'opportunity', 'being', 'better', 'film', 'Falling', 'Down', '1993', 'are', 'couple', 'bad', 'customer', 'service', 'situations', 'have', 'experienced', 'Rampage', 'could', 'have', 'improved', 'were', 'more', 'reasons', 'actual', 'rampage', 'are', 'relevant', 'society', '2012', 'also', 'refreshing', 'reasons', 'extreme', 'events', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'religion', 'terrorist', 'connection.Surprisingly', 'Uwe', 'children', 'were', 'portrayed', 'film', 'used', 'victims', 'must', 'be', 'getting', 'softer', 'when', 'filming', 'violence', 'Nevertheless', 'rampage', 'hard', 'hitting', 'not', 'what', 'screen', 'are', 'watching', 'reading', 'more', 'random', 'shootings', 'news', 'mix', 'film', 'real', 'life', 'knowledge', 'unsettling', 'experience', 'ending', 'risk', 'brave', 'different', 'what', 'other', 'directors', 'would', 'have', 'done', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Uwe', 'Boll', ""'m"", 'reluctant', 'write', 'film', 'have', 'unique', 'moments', 'When', 'Brendan', 'Fletcher', 'character', 'interacting', 'others', 'clear', 'dialogue', 'well', 'written', 'feels', 'natural', 'Brendan', 'almost', 'scene', 'film', 'together', 'very', 'well.Rampage', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'story', 'good', 'pace', 'consistent', 'However', 'something', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'place', 'rampage', 'scenes', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'film', 'had', 'finished', 'could', 'not', '100', '%', 'believe', 'character', 'responsible', 'screen', 'could', 'deliver', 'trail', 'death', 'terror', 'did', 'think', 'lead', 'up', 'terrible', 'events', 'were', 'dramatically', 'strong', 'enough', 'reason', 'subsequent', 'chaos', 'probably', 'exact', 'thought', 'minds', 'people', 'real', 'life', 'have', 'survived', 'terrible', 'ordeal', 'have', 'lost', 'dear', 'ones', 'random', 'acts', 'pure', 'evil.bleedingcriticbleedingfilms.com']",N/A
1337380,A39FKP35OY8VM2,B003DLTBVW,Adam,"[0, 0]","This movie was recommended by my Netflix account, which leads me to wonder if I should reconsider my genre interests.  All humor aside, I felt that this film was pretty well done.  It is a dark film and I can understand why some folks might not enjoy it because of the subject material, but from a film standpoint I think it was done nicely.I had some doubts if this was even worth my time, especially given that I really don't like anything by its director.  Basically, it's about an unhappy twenty-something that is living at home with parents who are awkwardly coaxing him out of the house.  Clearly upset with his parents as well as the world in general, he is planning a grand-scale massacre to get a point across.  However, as events transpire, we quickly learn that his actual intentions are not what he's proclaiming.  Overall, the story hooked me to the end and I felt the acting was good.  Brendan Fletcher fits the role of the disturbed individual well, particularly with his facial expressions and eyes that are haunting to say the least.As a disclaimer, I will emphasize that a lot of people are senselessly killed.  At some points, I couldn't help but feel sorry that they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  However, I didn't feel this film glorified their deaths like some people might suggest.  Similarly, I didn't feel their deaths were particularly gory either.  Granted, there is some blood, but nowhere near the kind of stuff you would see in ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"".  I'm struck by the fact that a good number of people gave negative reviews because of this, yet are probably the type to watch ""CSI"" or ""Criminal Minds"" where some poor sap gets murdered every week.  Maybe it's a difference in opinion, but I personally felt this film didn't go too far over the line.In summary, I give it four stars for a good story and the lack of glorification.  I would best describe it as a short film about a disturbed person who gets out of line.  Probably not a film to save for date night or to watch with your Grandma after Christmas dinner, but worth a chance if you prefer darker films and can accept the subject material.",4,A Dark Film,1301702400,"04 2, 2011",2011,2151,"['movie', 'was', 'recommended', 'Netflix', 'account', 'wonder', 'should', 'reconsider', 'genre', 'interests', 'humor', 'aside', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'dark', 'film', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'folks', 'might', 'not', 'enjoy', 'subject', 'material', 'film', 'standpoint', 'think', 'was', 'done', 'nicely.I', 'had', 'doubts', 'was', 'even', 'worth', 'time', 'especially', 'given', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'anything', 'director', 'Basically', 'unhappy', 'twenty-something', 'living', 'home', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'awkwardly', 'coaxing', 'house', 'Clearly', 'upset', 'parents', 'as', 'well', 'world', 'general', 'planning', 'grand-scale', 'massacre', 'get', 'point', 'across', 'However', 'events', 'transpire', 'quickly', 'learn', 'actual', 'intentions', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'proclaiming', 'Overall', 'story', 'hooked', 'end', 'felt', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'Brendan', 'Fletcher', 'role', 'disturbed', 'individual', 'well', 'particularly', 'facial', 'expressions', 'eyes', 'are', 'haunting', 'say', 'least.As', 'disclaimer', 'will', 'emphasize', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'senselessly', 'killed', 'points', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'happened', 'be', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'film', 'glorified', 'deaths', 'people', 'might', 'suggest', 'Similarly', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'deaths', 'were', 'particularly', 'gory', 'either', 'Granted', 'blood', 'nowhere', 'kind', 'stuff', 'would', 'see', 'Saw', 'Hostel', ""'m"", 'struck', 'fact', 'good', 'number', 'people', 'gave', 'negative', 'reviews', 'are', 'probably', 'type', 'watch', 'CSI', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'where', 'poor', 'sap', 'murdered', 'week', 'difference', 'opinion', 'personally', 'felt', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'far', 'line.In', 'summary', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'good', 'story', 'lack', 'glorification', 'would', 'best', 'describe', 'short', 'film', 'disturbed', 'person', 'who', 'line', 'Probably', 'not', 'film', 'save', 'date', 'night', 'watch', 'Grandma', 'Christmas', 'dinner', 'chance', 'prefer', 'darker', 'films', 'can', 'accept', 'subject', 'material']",N/A

The acting is horrible... the plot thin.. but it will be praised by all those who like seeing innocent people pleading for their lives, and shot in gory detail by a punk covered in armor, playing God with automatic weapons. Women, men, children, all unarmed, and all killed in cold blood as they try running and hiding... with the character making a clean break. The film maker tries to suggest to the audience through a closing historical note, that the character had some reason (population control), and that he is still at large.. insinuating that he was real (an excuse for having taken this sewage to film). But it's not, it's all fake, it never happened. Not to say this won't be food for thought for many a psychotic killer, as it doubtless will; you can blame Uwe Bol, for having made our world a less-safe place to live by bringing us this film.The scene in the hair salon when he gathers the women up, helpless and unarmed, shaking and pleading for their lives, then shoots them all crowded at the end of the hallway, bodies piling up as the bullets riddle their bodies, should get this film an X rating for violence.

1337383,AG5XM49AZVIYH,B003DLTBVW,"Ben ""Pizza Enthusiast""","[3, 5]","From a purely artistic point of view, RAMPAGE is a decent enough film. The camerawork is solid, the gore is, for the most part, realistic, and the acting is adequate. It also does a decent job at creating suspense in the right places. My only complaints with the visuals are the occasional poorly structured CGI scene (one of the exploding cars looks pathetically fake) and the close-ups on main character Bill Williamson's face as he fires his guns. These close-ups were obviously done for dramatic effect, but they come across as extremely cheesy.Taking this film as a whole, though, I can't give it much praise. Though it is not a video game adaptation (Uwe Boll is branching out, ja?), one could argue that Boll probably wrote it after playing Grand Theft Auto for a few hours. For most of the film we follow Williamson around as he guns down people at random and torches cop cars with IEDs. Williamson even has the uncanny accuracy of a video game character, hitting people multiple times from a hundred feet away while running and firing two weapons at once. The only thing missing is the police. Bill is only confronted by two officers during the first half hour of carnage, which I found ridiculous (even after taking into account he torched the police station with a car bomb). More ridiculous still is Williamson's ammunition expenditure. He must have fired 1500 rounds (if not more), yet when we see him preparing his gear he only appears to have a half dozen magazines for his weapons. While we do see him reload a few times, he shoots many more bullets than we see him carrying. Furthermore, Williamson's framing of his best friend is so poorly executed not even the first officers on the scene would have bought that the kid had shot himself.Plot issues aside, I still have major issues with this film. If Uwe Boll is really trying to make a statement with this film and it isn't just self-indulgent violence (which is probably more likely), he failed. Williamson's reasoning for deciding to shoot up the city is that the population is growing too quickly and undeserving people are using up the world's resources. Yawn. While there is a certain revenge aspect (Williamson kills at least two people who had previously wronged him), these scenes are an aside rather than the focus of his violence. Surely Boll could have come up with something deeper? Williamson is portrayed as too sane for the viewer to accept his radical, idiotic reasoning for killing people and too insane to accept that it's just personal revenge.While the movie itself is not a failure, its message is. A movie with such gripping subject matter should aim to fulfill some higher goal and attempt to leave every viewer thinking about what he just witnessed as the credits begin to roll by. Instead, I found myself rolling my eyes at the concluding message which informs us that Williamson fled and is still ""out there."" Yawn again. As others have said, this movie is just a glorification of violence. If watching someone machinegun dozens of unarmed, fleeing citizens is your thing, then you've hit the jackpot. If you prefer violence with any sort of substance behind it, then prepare for disappointment.",2,Spoiler alert?

Rampage is a simple story that engages the viewer with a harsh acuity that is impossible to disregard.  If you're addicted to danger, this is awesomely brutal and all too real.  It's not based on a video game, Director Uwe Boll gets serious here and takes absolutely no prisoners.It's the story of a young man named Bill.  He's a bit of a slacker, floating around through life with little direction or motivation.  His parents are getting leery of his lackluster drive, putting pressure on their son to grow up and start showing some initiative.  One day, Bill finally reaches his breaking point.After being dissatisfied with the service from a coffee shop employee, Bill is bound and determined to get revenge.  Not only on the worker, but the entire town.  With a couple of machine guns and a full body suit of Kevlar armor, he goes on a killing rampage.  It's a harrowing display of controlled but psychotic madness.  Pretty difficult not to get immediate flashbacks of Columbine or Virginia Tech.Reasons?  The violence seems pretty senseless.  Frustration, indifference, mental instability?  Or maybe like the P.O.D. song, maybe Bill just needed to be hugged.  He seems to be a bit introverted, without too many friends.  He resembles countless other young people in society today.  Could be your son, your neighbor, your classmate.  That makes this all the more frightening.  He brashly claim to be on some sort of mission because much of the world's problems come from overpopulation.  Not to mention the ineptitude of the mass majority (this coming from a total deadbeat).  Anyway, time for him to start cleaning house, and it's survival of the fittest.Final grade = A.  Much like the hapless victims, I was blown away.  Rampage is a total shocker, plus a brash profound statement.  Oh, the acting here is flawless as well.  These awful events seem all too real.  It might be classified as an action movie, but it also qualifies as psychological horror.  Completely gripping and unflinching.

1337388,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B003DLTBVW,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 4]","I sit here in shock, trying to come to terms with the fact that I've discovered a Uwe Boll film that is actually watchable - even, gulp, pretty good.  I know, I know.  I can't believe I'm saying it, either.  What is the world coming to when I could actually enjoy a movie written, directed, and produced by Uwe Boll?  Make no mistake, though - this guy is still the worst filmmaker alive today.  I guess even a three-legged albino, mange-ridden mutt can get lucky once in his life.  This is still the German director who dares his most vocal critics to duke it out with him inside a boxing ring, the same man who gave the world such films as House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark.  In case you're wondering, Rampage is not just some clone of Falling Down.  What distinguishes Rampage is its implicit amorality.Bill Williamson is a 23-year-old loser apparently determined to mooch off of his parents for as long as possible.  His parents are actually encouraging him to leave and start a life of his own, while his only friend is one of those annoying liberals constantly spouting off about how awful the world is.  Whereas his buddy is all talk and no action, Bill is the opposite.  Haunted by a stream of constantly rotating bad news headlines and an inability to get a properly-made cup of coffee, Bill decides the overpopulated world could use a lot less people.  Thus comes the rampage, wherein Bill dons his very own Kevlar combat suit, loads up with automatic weapons and explosives, and sets out to kill as many people as possible, completely taking the ""Tender"" out of his home town of Tenderville.  Naturally, I expected a boring and mundane ending that would leave young Bill lying in a pool of his own blood.  That's not how the story ends at all. Boll actually takes the viewer down an unexpected path that actually makes the story memorable and causes the viewer to reevaluate the main character to some degree.  It doesn't make Bill any less of a psychopath, but it certainly distinguishes him from your average mass murderer.  This guy actually has some wheels still turning inside his head, and his plan definitely does not include suicide by cop.Bill's motivations are open to question.  He doesn't really seem to care about all of the bad news constantly bombarding his brain, nor does he seem to truly buy in to his friend's constant social commentary on the dire consequences of overpopulation.  Apart from a verbal conflict over a cup of coffee, there's no event that really triggers his behavior, either.  He doesn't hate his parents, who are very supportive even in their wish that he move out and begin to live his own life.  Apparently, his rampage is just something that has been building up inside him for a long time.  He may see himself as an agent of cleansing in the world, but he murders indiscriminately and without judgment.  Perhaps the fact that Bill has no clearly discernible motives for his actions is supposed to represent the utter depravity of society or something.  Then there's the bingo scene, easily the most memorable and surreal in the film, in which the clearly armed and dangerous killer walks throughout the building for several minutes without anyone even noticing him.  Boll obviously means this to be some form of social commentary of a world increasingly losing its humanity and peopled by men and women who turn a blind eye to even the most obvious sources of evil out there.  I guess Boll should know something about the subject, having personally made the world a darker and more depressing place with all of his previous movies.",4,Donkeys must be flying because Uwe Boll has actually made a film worth watching,1320451200,"11 5, 2011",2011,3589,"['sit', 'here', 'shock', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'discovered', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'film', 'actually', 'watchable', 'even', 'gulp', 'pretty', 'good', 'know', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'saying', 'either', 'What', 'world', 'coming', 'when', 'could', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'written', 'directed', 'produced', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'Make', 'mistake', 'guy', 'still', 'worst', 'filmmaker', 'alive', 'today', 'guess', 'even', 'three-legged', 'albino', 'mange-ridden', 'mutt', 'can', 'get', 'lucky', 'once', 'life', 'still', 'German', 'director', 'who', 'most', 'vocal', 'critics', 'duke', 'out', 'inside', 'boxing', 'ring', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'world', 'such', 'films', 'House', 'Dead', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'Rampage', 'not', 'just', 'clone', 'Falling', 'Down', 'What', 'Rampage', 'implicit', 'amorality.Bill', 'Williamson', '23-year-old', 'loser', 'apparently', 'determined', 'mooch', 'parents', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'parents', 'are', 'actually', 'encouraging', 'leave', 'start', 'life', 'own', 'only', 'friend', 'one', 'annoying', 'liberals', 'constantly', 'spouting', 'off', 'how', 'awful', 'world', 'buddy', 'talk', 'action', 'Bill', 'opposite', 'Haunted', 'stream', 'constantly', 'rotating', 'bad', 'news', 'headlines', 'inability', 'get', 'properly-made', 'cup', 'coffee', 'Bill', 'overpopulated', 'world', 'could', 'use', 'lot', 'less', 'people', 'Thus', 'rampage', 'wherein', 'Bill', 'very', 'own', 'Kevlar', 'combat', 'suit', 'up', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'explosives', 'out', 'kill', 'many', 'people', 'possible', 'completely', 'taking', 'Tender', 'home', 'town', 'Tenderville', 'Naturally', 'expected', 'boring', 'mundane', 'ending', 'would', 'leave', 'young', 'Bill', 'lying', 'pool', 'own', 'blood', 'not', 'how', 'story', 'Boll', 'actually', 'viewer', 'down', 'unexpected', 'path', 'actually', 'story', 'memorable', 'viewer', 'reevaluate', 'main', 'character', 'degree', ""n't"", 'make', 'Bill', 'less', 'psychopath', 'certainly', 'average', 'mass', 'murderer', 'guy', 'actually', 'wheels', 'still', 'turning', 'head', 'plan', 'definitely', 'not', 'include', 'suicide', 'cop.Bill', 'motivations', 'are', 'open', 'question', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'care', 'bad', 'news', 'constantly', 'bombarding', 'brain', 'seem', 'truly', 'buy', 'friend', 'constant', 'social', 'commentary', 'dire', 'consequences', 'overpopulation', 'Apart', 'verbal', 'conflict', 'cup', 'coffee', 'event', 'really', 'behavior', 'either', ""n't"", 'hate', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'supportive', 'even', 'wish', 'move', 'out', 'begin', 'live', 'own', 'life', 'Apparently', 'rampage', 'just', 'something', 'been', 'building', 'up', 'inside', 'long', 'time', 'may', 'see', 'agent', 'cleansing', 'world', 'indiscriminately', 'judgment', 'Perhaps', 'fact', 'Bill', 'clearly', 'discernible', 'motives', 'actions', 'supposed', 'represent', 'utter', 'depravity', 'society', 'something', 'Then', 'bingo', 'scene', 'easily', 'most', 'memorable', 'surreal', 'film', 'clearly', 'armed', 'dangerous', 'killer', 'walks', 'building', 'several', 'minutes', 'anyone', 'even', 'noticing', 'Boll', 'obviously', 'be', 'form', 'social', 'commentary', 'world', 'increasingly', 'losing', 'humanity', 'peopled', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'even', 'most', 'obvious', 'sources', 'evil', 'there', 'guess', 'Boll', 'should', 'know', 'something', 'subject', 'having', 'personally', 'made', 'world', 'darker', 'more', 'depressing', 'place', 'previous', 'movies']",N/A

I'm not a fan of movies that start out by heading in one direction only to halt in the middle of something and then backtracking with a new account: 2 days earlier.  This is especially irksome when the direction Boll was initially heading was too brief to establish anything but a few scattered images and an explosion; he might just as well have started the movie two days earlier!  Not that it would have made any difference as the timeline in this piece was suspect throughout.  Images were oft repeated, news reports kept chattering in the background announcing events that hadn't happened yet, were happening, or had just happened.  At any given moment, it was never certain what was taking place, was it real, was it about to happen, had it happened already, or were these just the conflicting images and random thoughts of a lunatic, or a very savvy bank robber?  I don't mind a little ambiguity now and then but not throughout an entire movie.  It's as if a hyperactive kid filmed then edited this piece as a class project.  At the close of it I wasn't quite certain what the point was; it isn't cynical enough to be political, it doesn't have the style necessary to make it an art film, the action isn't organized enough to make it a thriller.  What then?  Even the title is misleading, for although the lead character does go on a rampage, he never displays the required rage to make it feel justified (if only in his own mind).  The few circumstances that were brought up as evidence only suggested that he was having a really bad day.  Were all his days like this?As a whole, I found this movie curiously flat, displaying little emotion in thought or deed.  The biggest problem with this premise is that it demonstrated little we don't already know, while giving us characters so unrealized that we can't care about them or what happens to them.

Yes, this is the same Uwe Boll - as if someone else would name their kid that after the atrocious legacy this one has left - that caused more than one person to throw up while watching House of the Dead.  Not because it was gross, but because it was nauseatingly bad.  The same guy who inexplicably is permitted to direct films and walk the streets of Hollywood, much less use his voodoo to get stars to act in his films.  Well, Boll got one right for a change.In a possible homage to the popularity of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, and possibly to society's desensitization to violence, Rampage delivers a gut punch of nearly unexplainable carnage.  After mail ordering all the Kevlar body armor a guy could use, getting angered by the lack of civility among the general populace, and listening to the constant drone of his pseudo-intellectual, save-the-world, all talk acquaintance, Bill (Brendan Fletcher) decides to get off his parents' couch and do something about what's been irking him.  Ignore the tedious start and the poorly executed jump cuts; this is Michael Douglas from Falling Down if that character actually formed a plan instead of snapping during traffic.Once the action of a killing spree starts, the movie goes full throttle.  Octogenarian bingo games notwithstanding (a hilarious pace changer) the entire back half of this movie is a nihilist's wet dream.  Sadistic undertones and a hint of story are more than enough fuel to last until the credits roll.  While the character development is lacking, and there isn't profound depth in the script, the massacre, because it reverberates in our memories of Columbine and Virginia Tech, feels all too realistic.

Mr. Boll's work has been surrounded by a lot of contentious debate regarding its quality, in which even he himself has been involved - and I don't want to get into here.  With that said, I can truly say this movie was a huge surprise, surpassing all of my expectations - and then some!  I heard good things about the film quite some time ago, and eagerly rushed out to rent it when I found out it had been released.The plot is quite simple: a trouble young man (early 20s) is taken to the limits and beyond by various stressors and goes on a bloody rampage.  (The title may have clued you in a bit!)  While the plot is simple, the story contains some very interesting twists and turns, which I'll leave to the viewers to find out for themselves.  The film is powerful, gripping, ultra-violent, and, in some ways, thought provoking.  It's partially shot in what can be described as ""documentary style"" - i.e. shaky cameras, chase footage, etc - but not entirely.  Some of the film is more traditional in its approach to capture the on screen events, and does so with a fairly high level of production.  Even the documentary style shots don't come across like the ""Blair Witch.""  They're much more polished.  There is no ""rock"" soundtrack or catchy theme music, and the film doesn't try to portray the seemingly mindless violence that is at its core as entertainment.  Rather, the film is more of a documentary of a trouble person, who on the outside seems lost, but inside is revealed to be quite clever and calculating.  The overall filmmaking approach makes for a truly powerful film.  From scene to scene, the suspense is tangible and you'll hold your breath waiting for events to unfold - at least, I did.The few faults I found were regarding some weak/stiff acting by certain - secondary - characters in the film, and a few special effects that seemed cheaply done, something which, in my opinion, breaks the suspension of disbelief.  But taken with the numerous positive aspects of the film, they fail to detract a significant amount from the film.I highly recommend this film.  It's not an action film, and it's not a horror film.  In fact, I don't really know under what cinematic genre this film should be placed.  I think the film stands on its own as a violent and captivating portrayal of one young man's downward spiral (a term used in the film, which is exceedingly appropriate).  It's easily Uwe Boll's best work - by far!  Don't let disappointment in his prior efforts turn you off. Check out this film!Enjoy,JAG",4,A surprisingly good film from Uwe Boll....,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,2630,"['Yes', 'apocalypse', 'Finally', 'good', 'film', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'say', 'complete', 'jest', 'Mr.', 'Boll', 'work', 'been', 'surrounded', 'lot', 'contentious', 'debate', 'regarding', 'quality', 'even', 'been', 'involved', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'here', 'said', 'can', 'truly', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'surprise', 'surpassing', 'expectations', 'then', 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'quite', 'time', 'ago', 'eagerly', 'rushed', 'out', 'rent', 'when', 'found', 'had', 'been', 'released.The', 'plot', 'quite', 'simple', 'trouble', 'young', 'man', 'early', '20s', 'taken', 'limits', 'various', 'stressors', 'bloody', 'rampage', 'title', 'may', 'have', 'clued', 'bit', 'plot', 'simple', 'story', 'very', 'interesting', 'twists', 'turns', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'viewers', 'find', 'out', 'film', 'powerful', 'gripping', 'ultra-violent', 'ways', 'thought', 'provoking', 'partially', 'shot', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'documentary', 'style', 'i.e', 'shaky', 'cameras', 'chase', 'footage', 'etc', 'not', 'entirely', 'film', 'more', 'traditional', 'approach', 'capture', 'screen', 'events', 'so', 'fairly', 'high', 'level', 'production', 'Even', 'documentary', 'style', 'shots', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'Blair', 'Witch', ""'re"", 'much', 'more', 'polished', 'rock', 'soundtrack', 'catchy', 'theme', 'music', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'portray', 'seemingly', 'mindless', 'violence', 'core', 'entertainment', 'film', 'more', 'documentary', 'trouble', 'person', 'who', 'outside', 'lost', 'inside', 'revealed', 'be', 'quite', 'clever', 'calculating', 'overall', 'filmmaking', 'approach', 'truly', 'powerful', 'film', 'scene', 'scene', 'suspense', 'tangible', ""'ll"", 'hold', 'breath', 'waiting', 'events', 'unfold', 'least', 'did.The', 'few', 'faults', 'found', 'were', 'regarding', 'weak/stiff', 'acting', 'certain', 'secondary', 'characters', 'film', 'few', 'special', 'effects', 'seemed', 'cheaply', 'done', 'something', 'opinion', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'taken', 'numerous', 'positive', 'aspects', 'film', 'fail', 'detract', 'significant', 'amount', 'film.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'cinematic', 'genre', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'placed', 'think', 'film', 'own', 'violent', 'captivating', 'portrayal', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'downward', 'spiral', 'term', 'used', 'film', 'exceedingly', 'appropriate', 'easily', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'best', 'work', 'far', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'disappointment', 'prior', 'efforts', 'turn', 'off', 'Check', 'out', 'film', 'Enjoy', 'JAG']",N/A

I thought it was pretty darn good and had interesting thoughts behind the action. It wasn't mainly about someone who went psycho and went killing a bunch of people. The character actually had a pretty good concept behind the killings. Many do in movies, but this one was actually more believable than I expected. When my dad told me about this movie he said ""It is about this guy who creates his own bullet proof outfit and just goes around seeing how many people he can kill.""That was a basic description of it, but if he would have explained further about the motive behind the character doing that, I would have watched it sooner. Usually the movies he says are good normally are, and he was right about this one. I think it could have had a better build up on the story behind his concept of killing these people before he did so, but then again it was explained fully at the end.

This movie doesn't deserved to be as overlooked as it has. Rampage is a brilliant...brilliant...brilliant movie. I wouldn't recommend this at all to the sensitive. The movie is basically about a killer that goes on a rampage. There is no sense of justice, and there is no rational point (aside from his ramblings about cleansing society). What you basically watch is a disturbed person that finally cracks and breaks.Like most lunatics they think what they are doing is right and they believe it to the core. It's the exact feeling you get when you watch rampage. A 23 year old failure living at home with his parents (who is a leech of society himself) who hasn't figured out yet how to survive in the real world on his own. His answer to growing up and moving out is to create an idea in his head that all these working people are wrong and their way of life isn't idealistic how people should live. Everything people work for in life is a lie.Some how Bill(the main character) thinks that he can help improve the world by killing random people and calling it ""population control"". So that the rest of society can live freely of all the leeches not providing for the rest of the world. It's a crazy idea and makes about as much sense as every other lunatic that kills innocent people. A corrupt idea to support an unjust action. So at the cost of Bill's warped psychology 93 innocent people lose their lives.There's no hero in this film and no one to cheer for. It's more like watching a bad accident. It's terrible but somehow you can't take your eyes off of what's going on. To sum it up this movie is nothing more than watching a lunatic going on a killing spree. That be just about your typical gun man today...but this one has a movie that you can watch.If you've seen a Uwe Boll film before believe me this is nothing like any of them!

1337401,A1WJZABTJOW65B,B003DLTBVW,"Michael A. Mccullough ""Argento Fan""","[2, 3]","Much of the first 40 minutes of the movie consists of flash-forwards.  In fact, one of the first scenes in the movie is one of the last.  Boll appears to be trying to be clever, but the scenes are presented with no context, nothing to connect them to what's going on in the actual scene.  The most obvious of these is Bill, our rampager, shirtless, pouring gasoline into a  barrel, and setting it on fire.  We're supposed to assume that it has some sort of importance given its prominence at the beginning of the film, but in the end it's just a bit of plot.  It has the appearance of significance, but no real symbolic meaning.  In a similar way, interspersed with the flash-forwards are clips of Bill in front of a white background, and while these are explained later in the film, that explanation becomes one of its major problems.Another ""filmic"" technique that Boll gets wrong is the random clips of news and talk show audio at different points in the film.  The suggestion is that Bill is listening to these while doing something else (such as hitting a punching bag, driving, or getting ready for his rampage).  Just like with the previous clips, you get the idea that Boll is using this for a purpose (in this case he's building up his case for Bill's rampage, a kind of audible explanation), but there are a couple problems with this.  First, the clips are random and general.  At no point does Boll relate these specifically to Bill's character.  Second, they invite the question ""Who's changing the channel?""  If no one's changing the channel, if we accept that this is an artistic technique, then they are there for the audience.  But that takes us back to the first point, and the weakness of the film's support for its theme.The key to a film like this is the buildup; we have to emotionally connect to both the main character and his situation.  The obvious comparison for this movie is Falling Down starring Michael Douglas, and the parallels are not just in general situation, although that is a good place to start.  The emotional connection fails as soon as characters begin speaking.  The dialog is incredibly stilted and flat; this might be appropriate for our main character, but his parents are the worst offender.  My first thought was that they must be badly improvising, and it appears that is basically what happened; the Netflix description mentions that much of the dialog was improvised.  Thus, an experienced actor like Matt Frewer (Bill's dad; not a phenomenal actor, but by no means bad) comes off looking like he doesn't know where the scene is going.  Bill's mom, played by Lynda Boyd (and actress I'm not familiar with, but who has a large enough filmography to make me think she's normally not horrible) is even worse; she stumbles through lines, each sounding like she's just thought of the words but not how to say them.  Improvisation is about responding and reacting to others, and I never got the feeling that the actors were actually in dialog with each other; instead, as often happens with bad or inexperienced improvisers, they sound like they're talking at each other. The end result of this is that at no point are we emotionally invested in the situation; neither in Bill, nor his parents, nor his friend Evan, no one carries any emotional weight, and thus the events of the film don't really matter.So, what about his situation?  Surely some string of events, even a string of minor-but-concentrated frustrations that represent the ever-present oppression of modern society, conspire to turn our boy into a mass murderer?  Nope, nothing like that at all.  Basically, our boy is a closet Malthusian (there's too many people in his small, uncrowded town with acres of undeveloped forest teeming with no one but paintball players), his parents are bugging him about going to college or some sort of trade school, and his boss wants him to work for his paycheck.  That's pretty much it.  He has a bit of trouble in a coffee shop (his macchiato wasn't foamy enough)and in a blindingly obvious nod to Falling Down, a fast-food worker inexplicably spills food on him.  Apart from his boxing (which he does in the morning while mom bugs him about breakfast; I mean, how dare she make breakfast for him and expect him to eat it while it's hot?!) we see very little frustration, very little pushing him over the edge.Movies should raise questions in their viewers minds, but those questions shouldn't undermine the film.  Boll succeeds at the former, but fails at the later.",1,Pointless would have been a better title,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,4515,"['Much', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'movie', 'flash-forwards', 'fact', 'one', 'first', 'scenes', 'movie', 'one', 'last', 'Boll', 'be', 'trying', 'be', 'clever', 'scenes', 'are', 'presented', 'context', 'nothing', 'connect', 'what', 'going', 'actual', 'scene', 'most', 'obvious', 'Bill', 'rampager', 'shirtless', 'pouring', 'gasoline', 'barrel', 'setting', 'fire', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'assume', 'sort', 'importance', 'given', 'prominence', 'beginning', 'film', 'end', 'just', 'bit', 'plot', 'appearance', 'significance', 'real', 'symbolic', 'meaning', 'similar', 'way', 'interspersed', 'flash-forwards', 'are', 'clips', 'Bill', 'front', 'white', 'background', 'are', 'explained', 'later', 'film', 'explanation', 'one', 'major', 'problems.Another', 'filmic', 'technique', 'Boll', 'wrong', 'random', 'clips', 'news', 'talk', 'show', 'audio', 'different', 'points', 'film', 'suggestion', 'Bill', 'listening', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'such', 'hitting', 'punching', 'bag', 'driving', 'getting', 'ready', 'rampage', 'Just', 'previous', 'clips', 'get', 'idea', 'Boll', 'using', 'purpose', 'case', 'building', 'up', 'case', 'Bill', 'rampage', 'kind', 'audible', 'explanation', 'are', 'couple', 'problems', 'First', 'clips', 'are', 'random', 'general', 'point', 'Boll', 'relate', 'specifically', 'Bill', 'character', 'Second', 'invite', 'question', 'Who', 'changing', 'channel', 'one', 'changing', 'channel', 'accept', 'artistic', 'technique', 'then', 'are', 'there', 'audience', 'back', 'first', 'point', 'weakness', 'film', 'support', 'theme.The', 'key', 'film', 'buildup', 'have', 'emotionally', 'connect', 'main', 'character', 'situation', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'movie', 'Falling', 'Down', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'parallels', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'general', 'situation', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'emotional', 'connection', 'as', 'soon', 'characters', 'begin', 'speaking', 'dialog', 'incredibly', 'stilted', 'flat', 'might', 'be', 'appropriate', 'main', 'character', 'parents', 'are', 'worst', 'offender', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'must', 'be', 'badly', 'improvising', 'basically', 'what', 'happened', 'Netflix', 'description', 'mentions', 'much', 'dialog', 'was', 'improvised', 'Thus', 'experienced', 'actor', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'Bill', 'dad', 'not', 'phenomenal', 'actor', 'means', 'bad', 'off', 'looking', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'scene', 'going', 'Bill', 'mom', 'played', 'Lynda', 'Boyd', 'actress', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'who', 'large', 'enough', 'filmography', 'make', 'think', 'normally', 'not', 'horrible', 'even', 'worse', 'lines', 'sounding', 'just', 'thought', 'words', 'not', 'how', 'say', 'Improvisation', 'responding', 'reacting', 'others', 'never', 'got', 'feeling', 'actors', 'were', 'actually', 'dialog', 'other', 'instead', 'often', 'bad', 'inexperienced', 'improvisers', 'sound', ""'re"", 'talking', 'other', 'end', 'result', 'point', 'are', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'situation', 'Bill', 'parents', 'friend', 'Evan', 'one', 'emotional', 'weight', 'thus', 'events', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter.So', 'what', 'situation', 'Surely', 'string', 'events', 'even', 'string', 'minor-but-concentrated', 'frustrations', 'represent', 'ever-present', 'oppression', 'modern', 'society', 'conspire', 'turn', 'boy', 'mass', 'murderer', 'Nope', 'nothing', 'Basically', 'boy', 'closet', 'Malthusian', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'small', 'uncrowded', 'town', 'acres', 'undeveloped', 'forest', 'teeming', 'one', 'paintball', 'players', 'parents', 'are', 'bugging', 'about', 'going', 'college', 'sort', 'trade', 'school', 'boss', 'work', 'paycheck', 'pretty', 'much', 'bit', 'trouble', 'coffee', 'shop', 'macchiato', 'was', ""n't"", 'foamy', 'enough', 'blindingly', 'obvious', 'nod', 'Falling', 'Down', 'fast-food', 'worker', 'inexplicably', 'food', 'Apart', 'boxing', 'morning', 'mom', 'bugs', 'breakfast', 'mean', 'how', 'dare', 'make', 'breakfast', 'expect', 'eat', 'hot', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'frustration', 'very', 'little', 'pushing', 'edge.Movies', 'should', 'raise', 'questions', 'viewers', 'minds', 'questions', 'should', ""n't"", 'undermine', 'film', 'Boll', 'former', 'later']",N/A
1337402,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B003DLTBVW,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 3]","I came to Rampage not knowing that it was written, directed, and produced by Uwe Boll. The poster, which shows an armed and armored man, reminded me a lot of the opening scene of Lethal Weapon 4. But you don't need to look far for Rampage's inspiration. It's not that Rampage could happen.  It DID happen: The North Hollywood shootout in 1997 was an armed confrontation between two heavily armed bank robbers and officers of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in the North Hollywood district of Los Angeles.Rampage is as much a castigation of gun culture as it is a fetishization of the perfect crime. Following in the footsteps of the perfect heist (Ocean's 11) and the perfect serial killer (American Psycho) Boll gives us the perfect spree killer. In the wake of the 2011 Norway attacks and Columbine, the horror of spree killings are still raw.  Why did they happen?  Rampage has answers.But there is no one simple answer. Intercuts of Bill Williamson (Brendan Fletcher) staring enigmatically at the camera while his supposed best friend Evan Drince (Shaun Sipos) rages against the world provide the veneer of sanity.  A disaffected youth about to be pushed out of his parent's home, Williamson has been working on his unholy vengeance for some time.  He imported weapons and improvised explosives, modified vehicles and crafted body armor, all with the intent of killing everyone in his path.  Whatever snapped in Williamson, it broke a long time ago.Williamson's rampage is at turns terrifying in its brilliance and callow in its callousness. He is a frustrated young man desperate for a connection with women when he takes an entire salon hostage; he is a petty bully getting revenge at the local coffee shop; he is a scheming terrorist who outwits an entire police department.  Williamson is every boogeyman rolled into one, waging a one man war on the world.Rampage has a short running time and it could be even shorter - the lead-up sequences are padded with scenes of the murder to come.  If it has a flaw, it's Boll's insistence on haunting every frame with screams and dire media reports. It's unnecessary.

1337403,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B003DLTBVW,Micheal Hunt,"[1, 3]","Rampage is a film about a 23 year old kid who decides one day he is gonna go on a rampage and shoot up a town and see if he can get away with it. The beginning is fairly slow, some actors do a decent job, while others, like the parents, act in ways that just where not convincing. What makes little sense is WHY this guy goes on a rampage, he hardly seems to fit the type that would do such a thing when you get the back story of how it leads up to the rampage event. You have to laugh that this movie did everything it possibly could to avoid showing or mentioning any video games, else the censors would have had a field day with this movie, and no, i'm not saying video games cause violence, i'm just saying it would have made a little more sense if that was his inspiration rather then ""paint ball"" games.In the end it tried to be a clever little thing where all the lose ends where tied up, however, I got them all, and I think everyone got it too, so the need for a montage to recap the previous events where pretty much pointless and I think they where going for something a lot smarter then they ended up with. Oh, and the done-to-death thing that everyone is sick and tired of, they try to claim this actually happened.... yeah, remember on the news a few years ago you heard about a guy going postal on a whole town? Remember that story? No???? I wonder why... cause it never happened, just like Blair Witch, Haunting In America & Paranormal Activity NEVER really happened and you would have to be pretty gullible to believe they did. So this just makes your eyes roll when you see them try to claim this happened, thinking their audiences are as stupid as they are for trying to pull such b.s.Overall, its decent, and watchable, but not the sort of movie that will become a favorite or something you would buy for yourself after you have seen it.

That film was a very unforgiving and very depressing story with hardly a happy ending. In this film the same holds true. A demented young man masterminds a scheme to go on a killing rampage murdering most of the people who live in his town. Indeed he kills about 75 percent of the people he comes across in a horrifying 40 minute killing spree. He feels justified by what he does. He feels no remorse what so ever. And worst of all he gets away with it. The sheer unthinkable horror that takes place in this film seems like some awful dream that could never happen in real life, but it already has, many times. People have already done things this brutal. Mindless, sickening rampages that boggle the imagination. This film is totally heartless and horrific in its story about a truly disturbed individual doing something that is so vile and ugly it makes you wonder what is wrong with the human race. Boll has been called the Ed Wood of modern day films having created apparently some very bad movies. Well I haven't seen any of his other films, but Stoic and this movie are both very good films. Some people felt the actress who played the main characters mother was a bad actress. I don't agree. She seemed naturalistic to me, meaning very real to life. An average person. She seemed human, normal, therefor her acting was good in my opinion. This is an ugly film to watch but its very well done and very sobering in its content.

This film is surprisingly good and I can't believe I had never heard of this film. Blockbuster video was closing down and I bought this film for $3 dollars. Well worth my $3 dollars. I understand why this film didn't make main stream theaters with all the senseless killings. I know this could be a dangerous film in the wrong hands. This film shows a fed-up individual who goes on a killing spree because he's tired of all the stress from life. The explosions and shootings look real and the tension can be felt. With the current shooting in Arizona this movie must be hard to swallow in Arizona. I believe this is the new type of horror that feels life like. Everyday people shopping and doing there errands are being shot down like animals is a trully terrifying scenario. If you want to see a modern day horror story look to this film.

1337408,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B003DLTBVW,trebe,"[0, 0]","Written and directed by Uwe Boll, Rampage (2009) is a brutally raw, ultra-violent, and relentlessly shocking tale, that while not without flaws, holds together surprisingly well.  Boll, no stranger to controversy, centers his film on Bill Williamson (Brendan Fletcher) a young man living in Oregon, who born out of frustration, seems bent on carrying out a senseless act of mass violence, but as events unfold, unlike many who go on a killing spree, Williamson has no thoughts of self-destruction.  Some spoilers follow so proceed at your own risk.Bill Williamson is 23 and lives at home, but is being pressured by his father (Max Frewer) and mother (Lynda Boyd), to move out.  Bill works at an auto repair shop, where he is not exactly the boss's favorite employee.  After work, Bill meets his friend Evan Drince (Shaun Sipos) at the Chicken Den restaurant.  Evan has a couple of packages for Bill, as apparently for some time, Bill has been having items he ordered delivered to Evan's address.  Grabbing a bite to eat, the guys arrange to meet in the woods the following day, for a paintball fight.Back at home, Bill surprises his parents with the announcement that he plans to return to college.  After his excited parents toddle off to work, Bill puts on body armor and a helmet, and armed with automatic weapons, drives into town.  Williamson has previously loaded a van with explosives, and rigged it to operate via remote control.  Using a radio control unit, he crashes the van into the police station, and sets off an explosion that disrupts law enforcement's ability to react.A large section of the film follows Williamson as he wanders through the town, shooting whoever happens to catch his eye.  Dozens of people are mowed down, as the streets soon become littered with bodies.  Children might be spared, but Boll has few reservations about who the violence touches.  At one point Williamson encounters a terrified woman cowering in fear.  Williamson calmly reloads, and then cheerfully shoots her dead.  Surprisingly, Williamson's boss escapes death, but Bill makes a special effort to kill several others who ticked him off earlier.A beauty shop is among Williamson's most notable stops, where after pausing for a drink he leaves behind a pile of bloody bodies.  The film's most surreal scene takes place in a bingo hall, where mostly elderly people are so fixated on the game, that they don't seem to notice that a man with a gun has entered the premises.  Williamson doesn't kill anyone, apparently because in his mind, the people already seemed to be dead.  Clearly another important statement by director Bol.Bill makes his way back to his car, and drives over to the bank to make a withdrawal.  After gunning down some hero types who try to jump him, Williamson gets the cash and heads out of town to keep his appointment with Evan.  On his way to the woods, the well-prepared Williamson takes out some sheriffs who get on this tail, setting the stage for Boll's bold and controversial finish.The deleted scenes indicate that Bol streamlined his story to focus more on the acts of violence, rather than on the details of Williamson's plan.  That such outrageous and wanton violence goes unpunished, is unexpected, and is the kind of statement that few filmmakers are willing to make.  While the violence in Rampage may be reprehensible and excessive, Williamson doesn't come across as a pretentious ridiculously clich&eacute;d character.  Ruthlessly executing a diabolical plan, the horrific violence has a realistic and chilling edge.  Brendan Fletcher delivers a powerful performance and the acting in general is strong and quite credible.Uwe Boll's commentaries are not to be missed.  They are typically very candid and revealing, and he also takes great joy in patting himself on the back.  The director often seems unaware, or perhaps doesn't care, that he is often his own worst enemy.  Constantly criticized, Boll has a chip on his shoulder, as he rails against what he perceives are injustices, and condemns those he disagrees with.Movies like Rampage,Tunnel Rats(2008), andPostal (Unrated)(2007), indicate that Uwe Boll is not the total incompetent that some have dismissed him as.  You may not always appreciate Boll's point of view, and he's clearly not the most magnanimous guy, but dismissing his films as total garbage might be a mistake.  Rampage is not without flaws, and the shaky camera work is irritating, but Boll pulls all the pieces together well, to tell a harsh and twisted tale in a stylish, clever, and uncompromising way.",4,Uwe Boll delivers sunshines and rainbows in Rampage...,1315440000,"09 8, 2011",2011,4568,"['Written', 'directed', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'Rampage', '2009', 'brutally', 'raw', 'ultra-violent', 'relentlessly', 'shocking', 'tale', 'not', 'flaws', 'together', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'Boll', 'no', 'stranger', 'controversy', 'centers', 'film', 'Bill', 'Williamson', 'Brendan', 'Fletcher', 'young', 'man', 'living', 'Oregon', 'who', 'born', 'frustration', 'bent', 'carrying', 'out', 'senseless', 'act', 'mass', 'violence', 'events', 'unfold', 'many', 'who', 'go', 'killing', 'spree', 'Williamson', 'thoughts', 'self-destruction', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'so', 'proceed', 'own', 'risk.Bill', 'Williamson', '23', 'lives', 'home', 'being', 'pressured', 'father', 'Max', 'Frewer', 'mother', 'Lynda', 'Boyd', 'move', 'out', 'Bill', 'auto', 'repair', 'shop', 'where', 'not', 'exactly', 'boss', 'favorite', 'employee', 'work', 'Bill', 'friend', 'Evan', 'Drince', 'Shaun', 'Sipos', 'Chicken', 'Den', 'restaurant', 'Evan', 'couple', 'packages', 'Bill', 'apparently', 'time', 'Bill', 'been', 'having', 'items', 'ordered', 'delivered', 'Evan', 'address', 'Grabbing', 'bite', 'eat', 'guys', 'arrange', 'meet', 'woods', 'following', 'day', 'paintball', 'fight.Back', 'home', 'Bill', 'parents', 'announcement', 'return', 'college', 'excited', 'parents', 'toddle', 'off', 'work', 'Bill', 'body', 'armor', 'helmet', 'armed', 'automatic', 'weapons', 'town', 'Williamson', 'previously', 'loaded', 'van', 'explosives', 'rigged', 'operate', 'remote', 'control', 'Using', 'radio', 'control', 'unit', 'van', 'police', 'station', 'sets', 'off', 'explosion', 'law', 'enforcement', 'ability', 'react.A', 'large', 'section', 'film', 'Williamson', 'town', 'shooting', 'whoever', 'catch', 'eye', 'Dozens', 'people', 'are', 'mowed', 'down', 'streets', 'soon', 'become', 'littered', 'bodies', 'Children', 'might', 'be', 'spared', 'Boll', 'few', 'reservations', 'who', 'violence', 'touches', 'one', 'point', 'Williamson', 'terrified', 'woman', 'cowering', 'fear', 'Williamson', 'calmly', 'then', 'cheerfully', 'shoots', 'dead', 'Surprisingly', 'Williamson', 'boss', 'death', 'Bill', 'special', 'effort', 'kill', 'several', 'others', 'who', 'ticked', 'off', 'earlier.A', 'beauty', 'shop', 'Williamson', 'most', 'notable', 'stops', 'where', 'pausing', 'drink', 'pile', 'bloody', 'bodies', 'film', 'most', 'surreal', 'scene', 'place', 'bingo', 'hall', 'where', 'mostly', 'elderly', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'fixated', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'notice', 'man', 'gun', 'entered', 'premises', 'Williamson', ""n't"", 'kill', 'anyone', 'apparently', 'mind', 'people', 'already', 'seemed', 'be', 'dead', 'Clearly', 'important', 'statement', 'director', 'Bol.Bill', 'way', 'back', 'car', 'bank', 'make', 'withdrawal', 'gunning', 'down', 'hero', 'types', 'who', 'try', 'jump', 'Williamson', 'cash', 'town', 'keep', 'appointment', 'Evan', 'way', 'woods', 'well-prepared', 'Williamson', 'out', 'sheriffs', 'who', 'get', 'tail', 'setting', 'stage', 'Boll', 'bold', 'controversial', 'finish.The', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'indicate', 'Bol', 'streamlined', 'story', 'focus', 'more', 'acts', 'violence', 'rather', 'details', 'Williamson', 'plan', 'such', 'outrageous', 'wanton', 'violence', 'unpunished', 'unexpected', 'kind', 'statement', 'few', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'willing', 'make', 'violence', 'Rampage', 'may', 'be', 'reprehensible', 'excessive', 'Williamson', ""n't"", 'come', 'pretentious', 'ridiculously', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'character', 'Ruthlessly', 'executing', 'diabolical', 'plan', 'horrific', 'violence', 'realistic', 'chilling', 'edge', 'Brendan', 'Fletcher', 'powerful', 'performance', 'acting', 'general', 'strong', 'quite', 'credible.Uwe', 'Boll', 'commentaries', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'are', 'typically', 'very', 'candid', 'revealing', 'also', 'great', 'joy', 'patting', 'back', 'director', 'often', 'unaware', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'care', 'often', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'Constantly', 'criticized', 'Boll', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'what', 'are', 'injustices', 'condemns', 'with.Movies', 'Rampage', 'Tunnel', 'Rats', '2008', 'andPostal', 'Unrated', '2007', 'indicate', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'not', 'total', 'incompetent', 'have', 'dismissed', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'appreciate', 'Boll', 'point', 'view', 'clearly', 'not', 'most', 'magnanimous', 'guy', 'dismissing', 'films', 'total', 'garbage', 'might', 'be', 'mistake', 'Rampage', 'not', 'flaws', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'irritating', 'Boll', 'pieces', 'together', 'well', 'tell', 'harsh', 'twisted', 'tale', 'stylish', 'clever', 'uncompromising', 'way']",N/A
