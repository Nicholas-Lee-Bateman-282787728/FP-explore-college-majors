1333349,A11SSYM4ISRN1I,B0038YX74Q,gclaheh,"[2, 2]","This is a really good reality show about teen moms and their struggles to raise their infants.  It isn't what I thought it would be because I thought that it would be the camera following the girls around while they are taking care of their children.  (I guess that doesn't make good TV).  It is really about their interactions with their families and fathers of their children.I am a married woman in my thirties who has a full time job who has a daughter the same age as their kids.  Compared to them, my life has much less drama.  My daughter has stayed in the same house, went to the same preschool, and her dad and I are married to each other and live together.  She has a lot more stability than the teen moms kids.I can't help but feel for these girls and sometimes forget how young they are.  I think that if I were in their shoes, I would probably stay dependent on my parents even now.  If I were financially independent, I would not have a great paying job and my career options would be limited because I wouldn't get my college degree.  My child wouldn't have much stability too.For Maci, I would advise her to try and communicate better with Ryan, her son's dad.  I would also advise her to not get a four year degree because it is no gaurantee for a good paying job.  She should try to start her own business or work at a minimum wage job and work her way up.  Or take that truck driving job that Ryan didn't want.For Amber, I would advise her to try to accomplish something in her life.  Get that GED!!!  Volunteer for something you are interested in.  Be the best mommy you can be to your daughter.  Positive action would make her feel better about her life and herself.For Catelynn, I think that she is the most mature teen mom.  I know in my heart that she will realize that she made the best decision for her child.  I hope that she takes the opportunity to pursue her dreams and gets whatever she wants in life.For Farrah, I saw a lot of growth and maturity in season 1.  It is hard to for young women to let go of the dream of finding a partner.  Many women much older than her can't accept that.  I would advise her to finish cooking school and to get an entry level job and learn everything she can.  Of course try to be the best mom she can be to her daughter.I wonder what will happen to the children of these teen moms.  It seems like there is a lot of drama in these children's lives because of their parents and it is hard to say how they will be affected.  I hope that they choose not to feel sorry for themselves and try to live the best lives that they can.  All of these kids have the blessing that there is at least someone in their lives who cares about them and I hope that it is enough to overcome the obstacles that they will face in the future.",5,Advice to all of the girls,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,2783,"['really', 'good', 'reality', 'show', 'teen', 'moms', 'struggles', 'raise', 'infants', ""n't"", 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'camera', 'following', 'girls', 'are', 'taking', 'care', 'children', 'guess', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'TV', 'really', 'interactions', 'families', 'fathers', 'children.I', 'am', 'married', 'woman', 'thirties', 'who', 'full', 'time', 'job', 'who', 'daughter', 'same', 'age', 'kids', 'Compared', 'life', 'much', 'less', 'drama', 'daughter', 'stayed', 'same', 'house', 'went', 'same', 'preschool', 'dad', 'are', 'married', 'other', 'live', 'together', 'lot', 'more', 'stability', 'teen', 'moms', 'kids.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'girls', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'how', 'young', 'are', 'think', 'were', 'shoes', 'would', 'probably', 'stay', 'dependent', 'parents', 'even', 'now', 'were', 'financially', 'independent', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'great', 'paying', 'job', 'career', 'options', 'would', 'be', 'limited', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'college', 'degree', 'child', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'stability', 'too.For', 'Maci', 'would', 'advise', 'try', 'communicate', 'better', 'Ryan', 'son', 'dad', 'would', 'also', 'advise', 'not', 'get', 'four', 'year', 'degree', 'gaurantee', 'good', 'paying', 'job', 'should', 'try', 'start', 'own', 'business', 'work', 'minimum', 'wage', 'job', 'work', 'way', 'up', 'take', 'truck', 'driving', 'job', 'Ryan', 'did', ""n't"", 'want.For', 'Amber', 'would', 'advise', 'try', 'accomplish', 'something', 'life', 'Get', 'GED', 'Volunteer', 'something', 'are', 'interested', 'Be', 'best', 'mommy', 'can', 'be', 'daughter', 'Positive', 'action', 'would', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'life', 'herself.For', 'Catelynn', 'think', 'most', 'mature', 'teen', 'mom', 'know', 'heart', 'will', 'realize', 'made', 'best', 'decision', 'child', 'hope', 'opportunity', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'life.For', 'Farrah', 'saw', 'lot', 'growth', 'maturity', 'season', '1', 'hard', 'young', 'women', 'let', 'go', 'dream', 'finding', 'partner', 'Many', 'women', 'much', 'older', 'ca', ""n't"", 'accept', 'would', 'advise', 'finish', 'cooking', 'school', 'get', 'entry', 'level', 'job', 'learn', 'everything', 'can', 'course', 'try', 'be', 'best', 'mom', 'can', 'be', 'daughter.I', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'children', 'teen', 'moms', 'lot', 'drama', 'children', 'lives', 'parents', 'hard', 'say', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'affected', 'hope', 'choose', 'not', 'feel', 'sorry', 'try', 'live', 'best', 'lives', 'can', 'kids', 'have', 'blessing', 'least', 'someone', 'lives', 'who', 'cares', 'hope', 'enough', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'will', 'face', 'future']",N/A
