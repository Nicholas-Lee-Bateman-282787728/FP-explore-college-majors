Indeed the idea of human beings ascending to a higher, more enlightened plane of existence was touched upon as was the idea of false religion and Gods in the form of the Goa'ould symbiotes, but with the introduction of the Ori and their religion that dangerously mixes truth and falsehood, Stargate takes off on its most complex and complete arc and raises serious questions in the mind of the thinking viewer.Daniel and Vala have been transported to another galaxy via the alien communication device, a device that puts them in the bodies of a couple living in a town ruled by the Priors, priests of the Ori. The hapless couple whose bodies they overtake don't trade places with Daniel and Vala due to an incomplete communication device on their end and turn out to be resistors against the powerful Ori and their religion. The Ori are ascended beings, just like the ancients in our own Milky Way, who have chosen to take advantage of the power of ascension to rule the humans in their galaxy and derive more power from their worship.

1014702,A3IQE221543WV2,B000HEZEY6,Ani K,"[0, 0]","What were people expecting after all the System Lords were defeated?  Also, the Stargate crew expected the series to be cancelled or ended already after season 8 and never expected for SCY-FY or Sci-Fi to bring back for another season so unexpectedly they had to rush how bring the series back for season 9.  I really can not see what the problem is, it is just a new story without Richard Dean Anderson being part of the cast (because in real life he wanted to be with his family) and two of the Farscape cast brought to Stargate (which I love Farscape).  I also found this season interesting how much deeper about how the whole Stargate started such who created the ring.  As I remember Stargate SG-1 season 1 I was like WTF?  This does not look really good, started a bit weak for me but by the end I was hooked and obviously it is not as close as the Stargate movie but it least they gave us a good continuation after how the movie ended.  What I think most of the people are annoyed is about the Ancients who live through higher existence and than how the whole Ori arc gets brought.  But after 8 seasons how much longer can a System Lord or Gou'ld arc could have gone?  I find it normal for most shows after eight seasons no to do so well.  You can tell that the series kind of ended after the last two episodes on Season 8 where they time travel for ZPM, none of the seasons ever end with such a ridiculous finally like that.",5,Seeing a lot of useless complains about this season,1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,1432,"['What', 'were', 'people', 'expecting', 'System', 'Lords', 'were', 'defeated', 'Also', 'Stargate', 'crew', 'expected', 'series', 'be', 'cancelled', 'ended', 'already', 'season', '8', 'never', 'expected', 'SCY-FY', 'Sci-Fi', 'bring', 'back', 'season', 'so', 'unexpectedly', 'had', 'rush', 'how', 'bring', 'series', 'back', 'season', '9', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'problem', 'just', 'new', 'story', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'being', 'part', 'cast', 'real', 'life', 'wanted', 'be', 'family', 'two', 'Farscape', 'cast', 'brought', 'Stargate', 'love', 'Farscape', 'also', 'found', 'season', 'interesting', 'how', 'much', 'deeper', 'how', 'whole', 'Stargate', 'started', 'such', 'who', 'created', 'ring', 'remember', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'season', '1', 'was', 'WTF', 'not', 'look', 'really', 'good', 'started', 'bit', 'weak', 'end', 'was', 'hooked', 'obviously', 'not', 'as', 'close', 'Stargate', 'movie', 'least', 'gave', 'good', 'continuation', 'how', 'movie', 'ended', 'What', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'annoyed', 'Ancients', 'who', 'live', 'higher', 'existence', 'how', 'whole', 'Ori', 'arc', 'brought', '8', 'seasons', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'can', 'System', 'Lord', ""Gou'ld"", 'arc', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'find', 'normal', 'most', 'shows', 'eight', 'seasons', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'can', 'tell', 'series', 'kind', 'ended', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'Season', '8', 'where', 'time', 'travel', 'ZPM', 'none', 'seasons', 'ever', 'end', 'ridiculous', 'finally']",N/A
1014703,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B000HEZEY6,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 1]","I where not to thrilled about Stargate SG1 season 8, but I have to say that the night season picks the show right back up and bring it back on track. Normally I am not a big fan of a show where the main character is changed so knowing this would happen in this season I was a bit hesitant going in, I thought this would be a bit like the last two seasons of X-files all over again, however I was proven wrong. Stargate SG1 reinvents itself in this season and Richard Dean Anderson's character leaving the show is done with style. Now I do not think the new team leader Mitchell is as funny or that he have as much a connection with the rest of the team as O'Neill, but he works well enough and the change is not jarring. The only thing I do not like is that Carter is not made leader of the team, yes it is explained in setting with her taking time off to work on other projects, but still, is it so hard for a science fiction series to have a woman in charge of the main team which is out there in the middle of the action?I love the Ori arch which begins in this season. The Goa'ould have been pretty much defeated and what is left did not feel that threatening anymore, the writers of this series have however managed to bring back the David against Goliath feeling that the first seasons of SG1 had with this new arch, at the same time the new storyline manages to continue the series main theme of false Gods and the idea of powerful creatures exploiting those weaker than them and by appearing as Gods and demanding worship, but even more than earlier shows season nine and the Ori storylines is a commentary on religion and faith given freely vs powerful organizations forcing others to follow their religions.In season eight there where little exploring however all that is back now, in many ways with season 9 Stargate SG1 have gone back to it's roots. Here we have desperate exploration of other planets to find a way to defend against a much more powerful enemy, we have technobabble and pulp action. I think most of the episodes of season 9 where great. If you have considered to stop watching Stargate SG1 after season 8 I recommend that you pick up season 9 anyway for most of the problems found in season 8 is fixed in season 9.So watch about the new characters introduced in this season. Well we have Vala, a former Goa'Ould host who now run around in the galaxy as a rouge and a thief, then we have Cameron Mitchell a Air Force officer who becomes the team's new leader. Both characters are fun, well written and dynamic, they bring something new to the show and are fun to watch. Off course these two are from the main cast of Farscape, and I was a little concerned that they would just play the same roles with different names, but they do not, both actors play these new characters completely different from how we have seen them before, and I think that both to a really good job of it.I do not think season 9 is the best season of Stargate SG1, however that being said I do think it is a pretty good one. I recommend this season, I definitely think you should watch it if you have seen season 1 to 8. Both me and my hubby really enjoyed season 9 and I know I will be seeing this episodes again and again.",4,The David vs Goliath feeling is back with the Ori storyline,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,3226,"['where', 'not', 'thrilled', 'about', 'Stargate', 'SG1', 'season', '8', 'have', 'say', 'night', 'season', 'show', 'right', 'back', 'up', 'bring', 'back', 'track', 'Normally', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'show', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'changed', 'so', 'knowing', 'would', 'happen', 'season', 'was', 'bit', 'hesitant', 'going', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'bit', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'X-files', 'over', 'again', 'however', 'was', 'proven', 'wrong', 'Stargate', 'SG1', 'season', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'character', 'leaving', 'show', 'done', 'style', 'Now', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'new', 'team', 'leader', 'Mitchell', 'funny', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'connection', 'rest', 'team', ""O'Neill"", 'well', 'enough', 'change', 'not', 'jarring', 'only', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'Carter', 'not', 'made', 'leader', 'team', 'yes', 'explained', 'setting', 'taking', 'time', 'work', 'other', 'projects', 'still', 'so', 'hard', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'have', 'woman', 'charge', 'main', 'team', 'out', 'there', 'middle', 'action', 'love', 'Ori', 'arch', 'season', ""Goa'ould"", 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'much', 'defeated', 'what', 'left', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'threatening', 'anymore', 'writers', 'series', 'have', 'however', 'managed', 'bring', 'back', 'David', 'Goliath', 'feeling', 'first', 'seasons', 'SG1', 'had', 'new', 'arch', 'same', 'time', 'new', 'storyline', 'continue', 'series', 'main', 'theme', 'false', 'Gods', 'idea', 'powerful', 'creatures', 'exploiting', 'weaker', 'appearing', 'Gods', 'demanding', 'worship', 'even', 'more', 'earlier', 'shows', 'season', 'nine', 'Ori', 'storylines', 'commentary', 'religion', 'faith', 'given', 'freely', 'vs', 'powerful', 'organizations', 'forcing', 'others', 'follow', 'religions.In', 'season', 'eight', 'where', 'little', 'exploring', 'however', 'back', 'now', 'many', 'ways', 'season', '9', 'Stargate', 'SG1', 'have', 'gone', 'back', 'roots', 'Here', 'have', 'desperate', 'exploration', 'other', 'planets', 'find', 'way', 'defend', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'enemy', 'have', 'technobabble', 'pulp', 'action', 'think', 'most', 'episodes', 'season', '9', 'where', 'great', 'have', 'considered', 'stop', 'watching', 'Stargate', 'SG1', 'season', '8', 'recommend', 'pick', 'up', 'season', '9', 'anyway', 'most', 'problems', 'found', 'season', '8', 'fixed', 'season', '9.So', 'watch', 'new', 'characters', 'introduced', 'season', 'Well', 'have', 'Vala', 'former', ""Goa'Ould"", 'host', 'who', 'now', 'run', 'around', 'galaxy', 'rouge', 'thief', 'then', 'have', 'Cameron', 'Mitchell', 'Air', 'Force', 'officer', 'who', 'team', 'new', 'leader', 'characters', 'are', 'fun', 'well', 'written', 'dynamic', 'bring', 'something', 'new', 'show', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'Off', 'course', 'two', 'are', 'main', 'cast', 'Farscape', 'was', 'little', 'concerned', 'would', 'just', 'play', 'same', 'roles', 'different', 'names', 'do', 'not', 'actors', 'play', 'new', 'characters', 'completely', 'different', 'how', 'have', 'seen', 'think', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'it.I', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'season', '9', 'best', 'season', 'Stargate', 'SG1', 'however', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'think', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'recommend', 'season', 'definitely', 'think', 'should', 'watch', 'have', 'seen', 'season', '1', '8', 'hubby', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'season', '9', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'again', 'again']",N/A

1014707,A394DKJBHFGD9V,B000HEZEY6,B. McClure,"[91, 102]","When I first saw the movie ""Stargate"", I was captivated by the storyline: A portal that is connected to other worlds, allowing almost instantaneous transfer, is finally figured out by us lowly humans, so of course we go to investigate.  So I was thrilled when it became a series, although I was only able to sporadically watch the shows at first (I have since filled in all my gaps with my DVD collection of the series).  The cast choice was perfect to me, and I was happy that it stayed together as long as it did (I was extrememly happy when Michael Shanks rejoined the cast full-time).  I thought it might go downhill with the departure (full-time) of Richard Dean Anderson.  Thankfully, the cast and crew were able to make it through Season 8, and in Season 9, they successfully integrated new members into SG-1.  Now, I'm also a huge fan of FARSCAPE, and even though I love it, I cringed when I heard that Ben Browder was going to be part of the team; I didn't think he would fit into this scenario.  However, he proved me wrong; his sense of humor is what the team needs, and even though he'll never truly replace RDA, that's not what I wanted anyway.  He's carved his own niche into the team, and what he's brought is fresh and funny (when it needs to be).  I was unaware that Claudia Black (again from FARSCAPE) was going to be brought in, and I again cringed, thinking that they were going to try and pair her and Browder together.  Thankfully, they kind-of-paired her character ""Vala"" up with ""Daniel Jackson"", and that has actually had me rolling on occasion.  The new additions to the cast are welcome in Season 9, and even though we've all heard that Season 10 will be the last, I'm hoping it isn't.

The humour was excellent and each episode was most enjoyable leaving me always wanting more. Well, imagine my surprise when i watched the first few episodes to find that the changes had not detracted from the show at all but made it every bit as good as before. The writers etc have not tried to replace the O'Niell character but have introduced a new dynamic with some excellent humour. The episodes have been very good and while I still have 4 episodes to watch, I am hoping that the rumours about the show being cancelled after season 10 are not true. I will watch this show for as long as it is available. (I have to watch on DVD as i do not get the show on TV here). I love the new humour from all the cast and the transition from the Gou'Ald to the Ori has been interestingly handled. It is also great to see that the team do not always succeed, but i hope that they do eventually overcome the ORI.As for the extras, I have enjoyed those I have watched, but I generally do not buy DVDs for the extras rather for the show/movie. The extras are a bonus.I would heartily recommend this season to any of the Stargate fans out there who are dubious due to the cast change. For those who have yet to watch eny episode, rather watch the first 8 seasons first, then this one as there are references to past incidents with flash backs that are not likely to make sense if you haven't seen them.Roll on the next season!!!!!",5,"As good as ever, if not better!!!!",1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,1589,"['purchased', 'season', 'trepidation', 'was', 'dubious', 'changes', 'casting', 'i', 'had', 'loved', 'previous', '8', 'seasons', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'rest', 'humour', 'was', 'excellent', 'episode', 'was', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'leaving', 'always', 'wanting', 'more', 'Well', 'imagine', 'surprise', 'when', 'i', 'watched', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'find', 'changes', 'had', 'not', 'detracted', 'show', 'made', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'before', 'writers', 'etc', 'have', 'not', 'tried', 'replace', ""O'Niell"", 'character', 'have', 'introduced', 'new', 'dynamic', 'excellent', 'humour', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'still', 'have', '4', 'episodes', 'watch', 'am', 'hoping', 'rumours', 'show', 'being', 'cancelled', 'season', '10', 'are', 'not', 'true', 'will', 'watch', 'show', 'as', 'long', 'available', 'have', 'watch', 'DVD', 'i', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'show', 'TV', 'here', 'love', 'new', 'humour', 'cast', 'transition', ""Gou'Ald"", 'Ori', 'been', 'interestingly', 'handled', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'team', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'succeed', 'i', 'hope', 'do', 'eventually', 'overcome', 'ORI.As', 'extras', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'have', 'watched', 'generally', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'extras', 'rather', 'show/movie', 'extras', 'are', 'bonus.I', 'would', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'season', 'Stargate', 'fans', 'out', 'there', 'who', 'are', 'dubious', 'due', 'cast', 'change', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'watch', 'eny', 'episode', 'rather', 'watch', 'first', '8', 'seasons', 'first', 'then', 'one', 'are', 'references', 'past', 'incidents', 'flash', 'backs', 'are', 'not', 'likely', 'make', 'sense', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'them.Roll', 'next', 'season']",N/A

Season 8 laid the foundation with a final show I would have been happy with.  No full blown resolution to Jack and Sam's hidden affections, but with the fall of both the bad guys and our General Oneal stuck on base for most of the season the quality dropped and the final episode left us with little question that they finally resolved themselves to play the game and get together a little covertly by simply getting out of the same chain of command.  The world was safe and enough technology gathered that we were comfortably on our way to being able to at least make a good stand.  But they just couldn't leave it alone.  You just don't replace the main character and go on.  Season 9 is just season 1 of the 2 season ORI plot that while maybe more insidious that either of the first two were whipped up to create a threat and SG-1 without Jack O. is just not SG-1.  I still watched, I still got some pleasure as I enjoyed the Atlantis sideline, but it was just the down side of the bell curve.  The dynamic of SG-1 was destroyed, suddenly the technology was a little to easy to understand and the invincible bad guys just never felt like it.  Because I liked it so much at it's peak I was able to get some enjoyment out of the last couple episodes.  But if you didn't love the show, you wouldn't want to endure the end.  At least Atlantis had a decent run and shut down when it was time, bringing enough &#34;closure&#34; for a sci-fi show to be satisfactory.

The Goa'uld have been beaten back, the series has neatly rid itself of Corin Nemec (Jonas Quinn) and, unfortunately, Don Davis (Gen. Hammond) and Dean Anderson (MacGyver...er Jack O'Neill). Also unfortunate was the addition of Ben Browder (Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell) and Claudia Black (Vala). The new bad guys also hardly rival the Goa'uld. The Ori, thinnly disguised Muslim fanatics, also don't quite develop as they should. It's too bad. The show has made it through all these years without explaining why everyone in the universe speaks American English, replete with 21st Century idioms, and seems to wear American-style clothing and have the same cultural backgrounds. We don't have one episode of Asian-like aliens, but the ranks of the Jaf'fa offer plenty of blacks and Hispanics to satisfy political correctness. The show made a concerted effort to revive after this wretched season, but is still bogged down by some of the characters. Still, why stop making it while it's improving? This is probably the worst-ever season, followed by the Corin Nemec presence in Season 6. Bringing back Dean Anderson would be a good idea; and as long as Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks are on the show, count me in.

I had finished the the Starburst editions of Farscape and was hungry for more Ben Browder and Claudia Black. I got tired of waiting for the US release so I imported the entire season from Amazon.co.uk. I can't believe the Brits get these shows before we do.... With all of the special features! (commentaries on every episode and 1 or 2 extra features per disc) I was never the biggest fan of Stargate, but this season has me hooked. Fighting real gods is a lot more intersting than fighting some aliens hiding behind technology. Can't wait for season 10. Kinda sorry it's gonna end there, but one of the producers suggested on a commentry that they had a solution to get rid of the ancients that he really liked. (if the ancients can be written of the show then maybe the Ori problem can be solved.)Most of the commentaries were done during the shooting of season 10 episodes currently airing on SciFi. None of the commentators seems to have any inkling that they were going to get canceled. This is my first Stargate DVD, but I assume that the comentaries are usually done by Producers, writers, and directors since I hear commentaries on every episode are common. The only actors commenting are the captain of the Promethius on ""Ethon"", Amanda Tapping on ""Camelot"", and of course the infamous pairing of Director Peter DeLuise and Actor Gary Jones on ""Babylon"" and ""Stronghold"". There isn't much breaking the fourth wall on the other features. There is ""An Introduction to Ben Browder"" which has him recounting his experience of joining the cast, doing stunts, watching every episode of previous seasons, and fielding questions from fans. The rest are either department features (set, props, Sfx, ect.) or the directors series.

The Ori storyline begins with the very first episode, continues through season 10 and concludes in the Ark of Truth movie. Despite not watching the first 8 seasons, I was quickly able to pick up on the background and history of the Stargate world and fit it into the Ori story arc. In the end, the whole viewing experience was one that was fun, engaging, and entirely entertaining. For me, the additions of Claudia Black (she is way awesome!) and Ben Browder in this season form a Stargate team that very nearly rivals the chemistry of the crew from Star Trek: The Next Generation. The overall look of the show is just great on my HD TV. While this is a review for season 9, I must add that season 10 is even better (because some of the non Ori arc episodes are outstanding). Yes, I'm sometimes tempted to watch seasons 1-8 to see more of Daniel Jackson, Samantha Carter and Teal'c. But I can't do it.

1014743,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B000HEZEY6,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[25, 30]","The Ninth season of Stargate SG1 has some major casting changes and the show handles it about as well as it can be done considering all that has come to pass.Last season ended some major plot lines and new ones are needed. The principle new adversaries are the Orai, an offshoot of the Ancients who seek to force their worship upon everyone. This does not mean that the Goa'uld are completely beaten. They too have some surprises in store for the SG1 team.The team has a new commander and he gets off to a rocky start, both within the show and in his part but he soon seems to fit in. He is not as humerous as O'Neill but he is a worthy leader.The newly freed Jaffa are in tumult over their own leadership. Louis Gossett Jr. does a good job of playing a leader in opposition to Teal'c.It's a new world but it still has more than its share of problems.Episode Synopses follow:Avalon parts 1 and 2: SG1 has a new commander, LTC Cameron Mitchell, but he has a problem. All of the old SG1 team has transferred elsewhere and he has to put a new team together from scratch. He is not having much luck. Help comes from an unexpected source. A former Goa'uld host turned con artist shows up. In her scheming, Vala gets Daniel Jackson to try on a bracelet. He does and finds himself locked to her. They cannot be separated for more than a short while without them both falling ill. She did not expect this. She was conned by the person she stole the bracelets from. This gives the new colonel an excuse to get the old gang together to try and fix the problem. In an attempt to shed light on the mystery, they begin to work on Arthurian mythology and find an outpost of the Ancients in England. It was the Avalon of King Arthur. They find the place but it is protected by a series of riddles. Solving the riddles reveals that this outpost was built by a group of the Ancients who did not ascend.  Jackson and the con artist are still bound by the bracelets but they have a clue that might help them get free of them. To do so they will have to use an alien communications device and try to contact the Ancients.Origin: Jackson and Vala make it to another galaxy using the communication device but they find that only their minds have been transferred. Their bodies are still back on Earth while their minds are borrowing the bodies of a couple of locals. They find a medieval culture subject to a religious tyranny run by men called ""priors"". The priors, in turn serve the Orai. The Orai want worship and they are pleased to learn of a new galaxy in which they can send their priors. They also want to suppress any knowledge which will conflict with that aim. It seems that the Orai are an offshoot of the Ancients who took a very different path than non-involvement.The Tie that Binds: Jackson and Vala are still tied together by the bracelets and are getting desperate for a way to get them off. She finally agrees to seek guidance from the guy she stole the bracelets from. He agrees to help but only if she returns a piece of jewelry she stole from him. She has already unloaded it but agrees to try. This is difficult because the person she sold it to refuses to return it unless she first returns a power coil she traded it for. When the owner of the coil is tracked down, he refuses to return it until she gets back the trading ship she took from him. This involves stealing it back from the thieves she left it with, lots of danger and a few buffoons. Eventually, the tangled web is untangled. This is not one of the better episodes.The Powers that Be: The Orai are sending out priors to proselytize out galaxy. When the SG1 team learns of one attempt, they head off to try and prevent it. They expect to be aided by Vala who has a history with that particular planet. What she fails to tell them is that her connection is that she was the host for the Goa'uld who was there god. She played this up after the death of the parasite so that she could continue as a god. When she returns, she chides the locals for turning their backs on her. Things go poorly, though when they overhear her talking about being a false god. That puts the locals squarely in the camp of the Orai's priors as a battle for hearts and minds ensues.Beachhead: A prior establishes a beachhead on a Jaffa planet and the locals want nothing to do with more false gods. This hacks the prior off and he establishes a force field around the entire planet fending off all the Jaffa who attack him. Meanwhile, Stargate Command gets a message from a renegade Goa'uld who offers to help in the fight of the Orai. Samantha Carter shows up to help out in the fight. They take the Prometheus and a Naquadria enhanced nuke to blow up the gate. Things get more complicated when a free Jaffa fleet shows up to try and destroy the gate. When the superbomb goes off, it makes the expansion of the beachhead even faster. This does not make anyone happy except the renegade who turns out to have hidden motives. Help in staving off the big invasion comes from an unexpected source.Ex Deus Machina: When a Jaffa is found dead on Earth, it raises some questions as to why he is there. His death correlates with the disappearance of several industrialists. Gerak, the leader of the free Jaffa, claims to know nothing about it. The emphasis is on ""claims"". Gerak is trying to stir the Jaffa council into working against the Tok'ra. He is also trying to sow mistrust for Te'alc who he sees as competition. The plot thickens when it becomes apparent that Ba'al is alive and on Earth. He wants to go into ""retirement"" and be left alone to pursue his own aims. He claims to have a naquada bomb in the US he will set off if he is bothered. Everyone wants to capture Ba'al for political reasons. Ba'al is captured and executed but that doesn't help since there seems to be more of him around.Babylon: While visiting a new planet, the team comes under fire from some hostile Jaffa and LTC Mitchell is captured by them. The rest of the team manages to capture one of the Jaffa. This group has, according to legend, not been subject to the Goa'uld for thousands of years. Jackson finds signs of Ancient technology but no sign of the Jaffa or the missing colonel. The Jaffa holding the colonel have some technology from the Ancients but are disdainful of everyone, particularly the Jaffa who did not follow them into exile. When a prior of the Orai shows up, the colonel learns that he has made some inroads. He realizes that this group of Jaffa allied with the Orai will be a major threat.Prototype: As last season concluded it seemed as if all of the threats from the Goa'uld had pretty much been taken care of. Then, earlier this season, we learned that Ba'al is still around and actually on Earth, biding his time in ""retirement"". This episode, we learn that Anubis still poses a problem as well. As the team is investigating a problem with a Stargate, they find a person in suspended animation. He is brought back to SGC and he claims to have been enslaved. Everyone believes him until Jackson finds some notes in the lab where the stasis field was found. They have found Anubis' private lab and the person they revived is a clone, complete with Goa'uld DNA. He is just a few steps short of being able to ascend himself. SGC sees the threat as too dangerous and they want to solve the problem right then and there. A politician, however, has other ideas. He sees it as a great opportunity to recoup some of the enormous investment put into the program and is sure they can control him. They are WRONG. Anubis is just playing along letting SGC do the work and preparing to strike. When he does, nobody can stop him. He does not, however, count on a dirty trick by LTC Carter.The Fourth Horseman: The Orai are still sending out priors and they are setting their sights high. A prior is sent to Gerak, the powerful leader of the Jaffa sect in power. Strangely enough, Gerak seems to fall for it. At first, the acceptance is subtle but the priors demand more and more until it is revealed that they demand the absolute obedience of all Jaffa. By this time, Gerak is in too deep to see the danger. Earth has its problems as well. People start dropping from the same plague induced by the priors a few episodes back. The plague spreads quickly. The one ray of sunshine is the return of the ascended Ancient, Orlan, who fell in love with Sam a few seasons back. He has returned to help but has had to take human form. He took the form of a child because that would allow him to retain more of his knowledge although that does put a crimp in his romantic aspirations. He is helpful but then he too falls sick. Before he does so, he reveals some critical information about the Orai and their priors. As everyone suspected, they are lying and there is a reason the worship of mortals is sought. Sickest of all, though is Gerak. He is ordered to destroy Chulak, the home world of Te'alc in order to set an example for all Jaffa. Even he balks at this...until the Orai make an offer that he can't refuse.The Fourth Horseman Part 2: Gerak is now a prior with all of the power that entails. He is determined to force the force the conversion of all Jaffa. Earth is still in the midst of the prior's plague. It has become international and the world is going to soon die. There is a hope. The lab has come up with an experimental gizmo that is supposed to nullify the priors' powers. They intend to use it to return to Soudan, the planet of the Babylon episode to tray and capture the prior working there. They want some of his DNA to try and fight the plague. The people of Soudan are not fond of the SG1 team but, when they arrive, it seems that the Jaffa there are becoming disillusioned and are ready to fight. They just don't know how. SG1 is there to help. SG1 plans even more. They want to try and turn the prior against the Orai. They manage to capture the prior but the cure doesn't work. Neither does their plan to turn him. They do get help from a surprising source, however. The source manages to effect a cure for almost everyone but there is still the specter of how to deal with the Orai themselves. There is also the problem of Orlan. He gave his all and now he is helpless.Collateral Damage: SGC makes contact with a civilization which has made a major breakthrough in working with Goa'uld technology. They have perfected a device to let people share memories. That will mean that a pilot or engineer could transfer his experience in hours instead of years. These people want to trade and SGC is eager. Unfortunately, there are plots inside of plots. The scientist who developed the process objects to having it militarized. That means she is a liability to the local power structure and she is killed. LTC Mitchell is framed for the murder. The hope is that he will claim diplomatic immunity and whole thing can be swept under the rug but Mitchell is not about to take the easy way out. He has actual memories of killing the woman and demands an investigation. In doing so, he faces a possible death sentence.Ripple Effect: Things are a bit peculiar when the SG1 team returns to SGC a bit early. The general is puzzled when they reference people who are dead or events that transpired differently from the way he remembers. A little bit into the debriefing, words comes that the gate has been activated and it occurs right on schedule for when SG1 should have returned. The returning party turns out to be...SG1. Things get a bit more confusing when other SG1 teams begin to arrive. Some of them contain dead members or people who have dropped out of the series. They figure out that a wormhole problem has caused alternate realities to funnel their returning teams to OUR Earth. Each of the alternate worlds is a bit different and each faces dire threats. Some of these threats have been faced on our world before and others are fresh. In an effort to avoid becoming the Grand Central Station of the Multiverse, the general orders a halt to further traffic. Now they have to figure out how to fix the problem. A possible solution is found but that solution has the downside that it strands all of those who were misdirected here to our world permanently. Even so, SGC proceeds with the plan and the alternates mutiny. They have a plan of their own and this gives the ""Real"" Sam an idea to restore things to the way they are supposed to be.Stronghold: The Jaffa council is considering a proposal to dissolve itself and hold widespread elections. Teal'c and his faction support it and they expect the only female member of the council to support it as well. When she gets up to speak, however, she speaks against it. When a member is asked to speak with her, she ""zaps"" him with something and he changes his mind. When Teal'c sets off to investigate, he gets captured by Ba'al who seems to be having a rather active ""retirement"". It seems that Ba'al is worried about the Orai and is trying to press the Jaffa into his service. The Jaffa are worried about the Orai as well but some things are just beyond the pale.Ethon; A few seasons back, the SG1 team encountered a world in a terrible state of cold war. The presence of the team sent the locals over the brink and the war heated up with devastating consequences. Now, the Orai have taken an interest offering a superweapon to one side in exchange for worship. SGC finds itself in the position of having to interfere again but not before Daniel is taken hostage by the party with the superweapon. The weapon, by the way, is very capable of defending itself with catastrophic results. Now the survivors of the attack are now faced with the problem of taking out the superweapon with the technology available to the war torn world. The solution further tears apart the world.Off the Grid: SGC gets reports of food riots and learns that the riots are not over hunger but over shortages of the addictive corn. Fearing some sort of Orai plot, SG1 is sent to investigate. Things go badly and as the team is trying to make its getaway, the Stargate disappears. The local drug lords think that SG1 is responsible and that means trouble for the team. The bigger trouble is that Ba'al is the one getting frisky. Nerus and his appetites give SGC some information that is, of course, bogus but by their manipulation he leads them to Ba'al. What neither Ba'al nor SGC seems to understand is the wrath of thwarted drug lords.Scourge: The SG1 team is given the awful duty of babysitting some international politicians and bureaucrats on their first trip off world. They go to the Gamma site where research is conducted on things too strange or dangerous to bring back to earth. One of the scientists is studying a bug that has shown up only on planets where the priors have shown up. The bug is a voracious crop destroyer but there is no proof that they are connected to the priors. All this change when some hungry bugs in the lab get a taste of meatloaf. Then they undergo a metamorphosis and become voracious carnivores and overrun the place. The bugs don't seem to be too choosy. They will eat bureaucrats as well as Stargate team members and scientists. SG1 evacuates the lab with the simpletons (I mean politicos) in tow. They have to hold on until a ship can come to pick them up. The one defense the team has is that the bugs are very sensitive to sound. That means that the guns keep them away...until they run out of ammo.Arthur's Mantle: Sam is in the lab playing with a piece of offworld tech that has been puzzling her for a while. She finally gets a response from it and it zaps her and LTC Mitchell with some sort of ray. They seem none the worse for wear until they notice that nobody else can see or hear them. They also cannot grip or handle anything. They are ""out of phase"" and stuck in an alternate dimension. While they are trying to figure out how to communicate with someone, a garbled messages comes through the Stargate from the world of the Soudan Jaffar.  They are under attack. SG1, minus Mitchell and Carter, head out to investigate and find that almost all of them have been killed. They were attacked by the Jaffa captured by SG1 (The Fourth Horseman Episode). He has been infected by a prior and can absorb a lot of damage. Meanwhile, Jackson figures out that the device Carter was working on was the legendary ""Mantle of Arthur"". It was used by Merlin to hide some of his experiments. He was working on a weapon to use against the Orai. LTC Mitchell heads out to Soudan to try and help Teal'c. He is still hidden but is convinced that he will be able to do something. When Teal'c tries the cloaking device of the Ancients, he is able to see and hear Mitchell though physical touch is not possible. That makes Mitchell able to really help, although SGC finds a solution to his problem at a most inopportune time.Crusade: A few episodes back, Vala was lost as she helped to destroy a gigantic Stargate intended by the Orai to be a beachhead into our galaxy. Now she is back...sort of. Her minds has taken over Daniel Jackson's body using the same crystals that she and Jackson used to visit the Orai galaxy near the beginning of the season. She has some startling news. The Orai's vast Armada is almost ready for them to begin their crusade. Also, she has become pregnant and does not know how it happened. She has not had an opportunity to engage in the activities that usually result in that condition. During the course of her adventures, she makes contact with the local underground elements and helps in a plot to destroy the invasion fleet. To do this, she is going to have to betray the one person she has ever really loved. That the plot fails just makes things worse.Camelot: The SG1 team is still looking for Merlin's weapon designed for use against ascended beings. The clues lead them to Camelot; a medieval planet with a medieval culture. They still wait for Arthur's return and they fear the workshop of Merlin. That workshop is guarded by all the usual stuff like black knights, swords in stones and such. The search for the weapon turns out to be the search for the Holy Grail, although they have little time to thinks about such trivia. The Orai have managed to construct a huge Stargate in our galaxy and the combined ships of Earth, the Jaffa and even the Drug cartels are on station to try and stop the emerging fleet as they pour through the breach. The battle is going poorly as this end of season cliff hanger comes to a close.",4,A Troubled but Worthwhile New Start,1161907200,"10 27, 2006",2006,18464,"['Ninth', 'season', 'Stargate', 'SG1',

1014744,AKT8TGIT6VVZ5,B000HEZEY6,John Kwok,"[4, 7]","I join the many fellow fans of ""Stargate SG-1"" in hoping that this splendid science fiction drama finds a new home on cable television, now that the SciFi Channel has cancelled it. Having caught only a glimpse of Season 9 as it is starting now its syndicated run on non-cable television, I have been greatly impressed with what I have seen so far. Casting both Ben Browder as Lieutent Colonel Cameron Mitchell and Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry were splendid moves made by the producers of ""Stargate SG-1"". Ben Broder's Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell comes across as a more thoughtful - perhaps more intelligent - version of the wisecracking Brigadier General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson), and more importantly, as the officer best qualified to replace both O'Neill and Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) as the new commanding officer of SG-1. Indeed, there is most definitely some excellent chemistry at work between Browder's character and those from the original cast, most notably Michael Shanks's Dr. Daniel Jackson. Beau Bridges' Major General Hank Landry is a worthy successor to both Generals O'Neill and Hammond (Don S. Davis). I was also pleasantly surprised with the return of Vala, brilliantly portrayed by Australian actress Claudia Black, who most science fiction television fans remember quite well for portraying Aeryn Sun opposite Browder's John Crichton in the ""Farscape"" series.I'm also greatly intrigued by the introduction of tne new evil alien race, the Ori, now that the Goa'lud have been overthrown as the System Lords of the Galaxy ruling vast armies of Jaffa warriors.

They had cohesive and original story lines and the show was actually about the stargate.  I was excited when new episodes came on because I was curious on what new planet they would visit.  They would explore new planets and actually do things.  Now it's like all they do is stand around and wisecrack.  They should have ended the show the 7th season strongly, instead of now blatantly 'milking the cow' for every last bit.Of course this is going to receive about 99% 'not helpful's because either all the fans are brainwashed or because they're die hard SG1 fans and any criticism would be blasphemous.O'neill was the pivotal character who tied other three together.  Jackson and the others just can't exist as a team because they lack chemistry needed for an entertaining team.  Bringing in Browder and Bridges to try to 'replace' Anderson and Don S Davis is just plain wrong.  It's like taking Capt. Picard out of TNG and still calling it TNG.  It simply can't be done in a way to keep the show intact no matter how much you love the other characters.  They are peripheral.Also, the overall seriousness of the show has really gone downhill.  It seems they have substituted good storylines with wisecracking remarks.  They've replaced a serious doctor by killing her off and replacing her with a wise cracking Lexa Doig.  And added a wisecracking counterpart to Jackson's character through a scantily clad Claudia Black.  Clever writing is good but constant and incessant smartass remarks does not fill in for a poor plot.Don't even get me started on the 'new villians of the season.'  It's starting to get as bad as the 'monster of the week' fest that plagued the X-Files.  The Goa'Uld were awesome, the replicators weaker but these Aurai are just plain lame.  I couldn't help but roll my eyes when the Aurai first visited the SGC and set himself on fire.  ha!The show just isn't entertaining anymore and that should be reason enough to end the show.  The stand alone stories are getting extremely desperate (think Teal'c getting stuck in the computer simulator).  Season 8 was all ready pushing it really hard, this season is actually worse.

It became close to unwatchable in its middle run, probably because the formula got old and some of my personal annoyances got really annoying and the writing overall became less interesting (or stale).Looking back, I practically couldn't stand the character of Daniel Jackson, and Jack O'Neal with his awkward sleep-inducing comedic timing (RD Anderson, pretending to be an actor). Those two obstacles are gone in season 9, since O'Neal is rarely seen anymore.... And Daniel Jackson finally got some spank after being banned from his ascension paradise (and then i understood that it's not the actor, Michael Shanks, i was hating but the character he played!), ditched his nerdy ways, grabbed a gun, but retained his knowledge, and gained a new, more... sarcastic(?) attitude.Next excellent move, dethroning Goauld as chief bad guys in favor of possibly the most spooky sci-fi villains on TV so far in this millenium and undeniably the coolest (yes, even spookier than Cylons, even tho' BSG is a better show overall). The Ori and their so-called Priors.However, I got to point out how wonderfully the goauld lord Baal is portrayed in this season and also the next one, menacing and genuinely scary but at the same time amusingly funny.Final, and the best change was recruiting two actual actors with great charisma (Claudia Black, Ben Browder) taken from a series akin to a cross between muppet show and sesame street, aka Farscape, and one veteran actor which complements the REVIVED SG-1 nicely, Beau Bridges.

1014778,A3C8FJF510MY4D,B000HEZEY6,Patient observer,"[0, 3]","To me, one of the 4 biggest problems with the Stargate sg-1 series is the Samantha Carter character and the actress who portrayed her.  This character's development was done all wrong she does everything and the actress's skill isn't proficient nor is she athletically fit to make the character believable.  It wouldn't have taken anything away from the character to actually have been shown to spend time away from the team being taught by aliens who were technologically more advanced.  In the previous seasons I believe only 1 actual instance of this happened, from an 11 year old(or 14, can't remember) girl.....  ridiculous.Then she's patching up foreign alien tech(even the ancients) with little to no exposure,  this would be believable if she was taught more and by various technological societies.  Instead it was ""let me look at that, got it"", it's as if she didn't want any time offscreen.  As bad as that is she's a pilot, tactical assualt member....from the air force ???  As a theoretical astrophysicist where does she find the time, given we've only seen the character behind a desk.  Amanda Tapping's potrayal of this character adds to the show's woes.  Simply put to me she's a very poor actress who delivers her lines in a very monotone form.  Her voice lacks inflection and only increases or decrease in volume, she can do two things.  Recite lines and cry.  If they replaced her early on the show would have done a lot better imo.  And the character development is pitiful(failure), takes over 8 years to accept and tell Oneill how she feels.  Bravo......Now moving on to season 9I liked season nine more then the first seven seasons, until Amanda Tapping returned, it started going downhill quickily after that.  I think that's why they bring Claudia Black back at the end.  Season 9 started out promising, Ben Browder is very annoying and I don't like that Tealc warmed up to him so quickly(without proving himself) but that's all minor.  For the most part it started out as the best season to date, despite me missing Macguyver's(Richard Dean Anderson)cynicism.I loved the back and forth between Micheal Shanks and Claudia Black's characters, it really was working as the comical angle to the show.  He was too harsh at times and should have been falling for her feints a bit more before he wrote her off like he did.  Then his hatred of her would have made more sense, it's almost like they need a missing episode or two to put her ""I'm pregnant and your the father"" comment in perspective.  It would have added to the Daniel Jackson character as he has a ""save everyone"" complex and she's a lost cause.  I don't see the character giving up on redeeming her so quickily.If you buy any of the seasons 8 and 9 are the best.  Would be better if the Samantha Carter Character had an actress who could make her believable.I rated the season only 1 stars because I really only enjoyed a handful(5 or 6) of the episodes.  The Ori, origin, was the worst route they could have taken in creating new enemies.  They should have focused more on exploration and old enemies trrying to reassert themselves.  The ori is uninteresting and stupid as it creates a situation in which they'll have to do something unbelievable to defeat them.  They are beings just about or as powerful as the ascended ancients how can they win ?  I would have preferred more sci fi type enemies different races other then humans and etc.  The ori just seems like a lazy and distastful way to pick on people's beliefs as it doesn't take a genuis to see that they are using misquotes from the Holy Bible as passages for the ""book of origin.""",1,"Good Attempt, started going downhill when the reintroducted the Samatha Carter character",1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,3627,"['one', '4', 'biggest', 'problems', 'Stargate', 'sg-1', 'series', 'Samantha', 'Carter', 'character', 'actress', 'who', 'portrayed', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'done', 'wrong', 'everything', 'actress', 'skill', ""n't"", 'proficient', 'athletically', 'fit', 'make', 'character', 'believable', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'taken', 'anything', 'away', 'character', 'actually', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'spend', 'time', 'away', 'team', 'being', 'taught', 'aliens', 'who', 'were', 'technologically', 'more', 'advanced', 'previous', 'seasons', 'believe', 'only', '1', 'actual', 'instance', 'happened', '11', 'year', 'old', '14', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'girl', '..', 'patching', 'up', 'foreign', 'alien', 'tech', 'even', 'ancients', 'little', 'exposure', 'would', 'be', 'believable', 'was', 'taught', 'more', 'various', 'technological', 'societies', 'Instead', 'was', 'let', 'look', 'got', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'time', 'offscreen', 'As', 'bad', 'pilot', 'tactical', 'assualt', 'member', 'air', 'force', 'theoretical', 'astrophysicist', 'where', 'find', 'time', 'given', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'character', 'desk', 'Amanda', 'Tapping', 'potrayal', 'character', 'show', 'woes', 'Simply', 'put', 'very', 'poor', 'actress', 'who', 'lines', 'very', 'monotone', 'form', 'voice', 'inflection', 'only', 'increases', 'decrease', 'volume', 'can', 'do', 'two', 'things', 'Recite', 'lines', 'cry', 'replaced', 'early', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'better', 'imo', 'character', 'development', 'pitiful', 'failure', '8', 'years', 'accept', 'tell', 'Oneill', 'how', 'Bravo', 'Now', 'moving', 'season', '9I', 'liked', 'season', 'nine', 'more', 'then', 'first', 'seven', 'seasons', 'Amanda', 'Tapping', 'returned', 'started', 'going', 'downhill', 'quickily', 'think', 'why', 'bring', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'back', 'end', 'Season', '9', 'started', 'out', 'promising', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'very', 'annoying', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Tealc', 'warmed', 'up', 'so', 'quickly', 'proving', 'minor', 'most', 'part', 'started', 'out', 'best', 'season', 'date', 'missing', 'Macguyver', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'cynicism.I', 'loved', 'back', 'forth', 'Micheal', 'Shanks', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'characters', 'really', 'was', 'working', 'comical', 'angle', 'show', 'was', 'too', 'harsh', 'times', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'falling', 'feints', 'bit', 'more', 'wrote', 'off', 'did', 'Then', 'hatred', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'almost', 'need', 'missing', 'episode', 'two', 'put', ""'m"", 'pregnant', 'father', 'comment', 'perspective', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'character', 'save', 'everyone', 'complex', 'lost', 'cause', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'character', 'giving', 'up', 'redeeming', 'so', 'quickily.If', 'buy', 'seasons', '8', '9', 'are', 'best', 'Would', 'be', 'better', 'Samantha', 'Carter', 'Character', 'had', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'believable.I', 'rated', 'season', 'only', '1', 'stars', 'really', 'only', 'enjoyed', 'handful', '5', '6', 'episodes', 'Ori', 'origin', 'was', 'worst', 'route', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'creating', 'new', 'enemies', 'should', 'have', 'focused', 'more', 'exploration', 'old', 'enemies', 'trrying', 'reassert', 'ori', 'uninteresting', 'stupid', 'situation', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'something', 'unbelievable', 'defeat', 'are', 'beings', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'powerful', 'ascended', 'ancients', 'how', 'can', 'win', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'sci', 'fi', 'type', 'enemies', 'different', 'races', 'other', 'then', 'humans', 'etc', 'ori', 'just', 'lazy', 'distastful', 'way', 'pick', 'people', 'beliefs', ""n't"", 'take', 'genuis', 'see', 'are', 'using', 'misquotes', 'Holy', 'Bible', 'passages', 'book', 'origin']",N/A

1014780,AAQE104YQ9N87,B000HEZEY6,"Peregrine ""Captain Peregrine""","[7, 9]","I love Stargate SG-1. I started watching it just as season 7 ended and quickly caught up over summer hiatus and was completely educated in the way of Stargate by the time season 8 aired. Season 1 had been decent as a starter season, season 2 had kept up the momentum and then the series had taken off with season 3 and continued well through season 8.But then, with season 9, SG-1 hit a wall. Of all ten seasons, I have to say that Season 9 was the most disappointing. I was increasingly forcing myself to watch episodes for the sake of watching them and not for any major entertainment value.The idea of adding an entirely new antagonistic character (in the form of the Ori) so late in a long-running series was ridiculous. Even the writers/producers/directors of the show admit this. What they should have done was end SG-1 with season 8 and turned season 9 into the first season of an entirely new Stargate show as they were planning to do anyway. Instead, however, they nearly destroyed an amazing show by introducing an impossible-to-defeat villain late in the series and then found themselves scrambling to find ways to defeat said impossible-to-defeat character in only a season. The problem was that they tried to restart the show far beyond the point they could. What made seasons 3-8 so great (even season 2 so great!) was that the end of each prior season had an episode that kick-started the next season with an already high-powered momentum. However, the last episode in season 8 ENDED the series, by all definitions. So instead of having a fast-paced momentum to carry it through, season 9 had to attempt to start a high-speed season from a standstill. That is what crippled its potential. Add to that the fact that they removed one of my favorite characters (though I know that was a personal choice on his part) and replaced him with a character that later became enjoyable, but which had to first undergo a slow, ungainly and sometimes painful process of introduction and integration into a family that had already formed and solidified its bonds long ago.SG-1 is an amazing show and season 10 did a lot to redeem the series in the end, but the extinction of the show was nearly brought upon us by season 9. Of the twenty episodes I would have to say that barely five of them were of any great quality. The rest were tolerable (and some barely that). It was a fool's errand to try and continue the show with a ninth season like the one we had instead of creating a new series as they should have done then.

1014783,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B000HEZEY6,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[0, 1]","I never watched Stargate SG-1 when it was originally aired. I think I started watching the show after I first watched Stargate Atlantis. I wanted to see the show that spawned a spin off series. I bought all of the seasons. I started to get bored with the show around season six and I stopped watching it for a couple of years. I went back and watched season six from start to finish. I think it was season six, but it could have been season seven. It's the year when the Daniel Jackson character had ascended and we got the other guy from the other planet to fill the missing role of DJ. Now personally I thought season 8 was fairly weak. If so, Season 9 is much weaker. I can barely watch the show. I am at episode 15 in season 9. The episodes are just STUPID and CONFUSING at this point. I mean who thinks the ""Ripple Effect"" is a good episode? That is the episode when they have 20 or more SG-1 teams who look just like SG-1 but they are from other identical dimensions. They all look alike and the uniforms are very similar. I couldn't keep track of who is who. Collateral Damage was awful as well. Prototype gave us a human who was suppossed to be as powerful as Anubis. The problem with the series in Season 9 is first Jaffa's are now in charge of themselves. The former slaves are somewhat brutish. They are not interesting. The Gould overlords were much more interesting, even if they had the flaw of arrogance. The Ori is too much like the Christians or the RELIGIOUS FANATICS coming to get us all. Richard Dean Anderson wasn't a great character as Oneill on the show but he is sorely missed in Season 9. I always thought he had a dumbass character but I see how he was needed for comedic input. Teal'c and Bra'tac are terrible as lead characters on this show. Bra'tac is so ugly and Teal'c now has that gay hair style. Carter and the Daniel Jackson actors seem BORED with the show. I don't know what else is in store in season 10, but Season 9 offers barely nothing but awful and confusing episodes. Beau Bridges is capable as the new General in charge. His daughter the doctor is ok and attractive. The writing by season 9 though shows the writers were out of material. I think that by season 7 the writers thought the show would be cancelled. I've never seen a show where they sort of foreshadow their own cancellation. The episodes almost anticipate the cancellation. Things are wrapping up, villians are being defeated, relationships are playing out. People are moving on. I always thought that the Gould's and the symbiotes and the Jaffa's and all of that nonsense was borderline gross and stupid, but at it's best the show was clever and creative. It was good fun science fiction. Season 9 is one long stupid plod. Season 9 probably won no NEW fans. Hopefully season 10 will have some of the old writing spark. I am having trouble watching the rest of season 9 though. This is my only review of any of the seasons. This review is basically me marking the dramatic decline of a once top notch sci-fi show.",2,Season 9 is pretty bad.,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,3020,"['never', 'watched', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'aired', 'think', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'first', 'watched', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'wanted', 'see', 'show', 'spawned', 'spin', 'off', 'series', 'bought', 'seasons', 'started', 'get', 'bored', 'show', 'season', 'six', 'stopped', 'watching', 'couple', 'years', 'went', 'back', 'watched', 'season', 'six', 'start', 'finish', 'think', 'was', 'season', 'six', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'season', 'seven', 'year', 'when', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'character', 'had', 'ascended', 'got', 'other', 'guy', 'other', 'planet', 'fill', 'missing', 'role', 'DJ', 'Now', 'personally', 'thought', 'season', '8', 'was', 'fairly', 'weak', 'so', 'Season', '9', 'much', 'weaker', 'can', 'barely', 'watch', 'show', 'am', 'episode', '15', 'season', '9', 'episodes', 'are', 'just', 'STUPID', 'CONFUSING', 'point', 'mean', 'who', 'Ripple', 'Effect', 'good', 'episode', 'episode', 'when', 'have', '20', 'more', 'SG-1', 'teams', 'who', 'look', 'just', 'SG-1', 'are', 'other', 'identical', 'dimensions', 'look', 'alike', 'uniforms', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'track', 'who', 'who', 'Collateral', 'Damage', 'was', 'awful', 'as', 'well', 'Prototype', 'gave', 'human', 'who', 'was', 'suppossed', 'be', 'as', 'powerful', 'Anubis', 'problem', 'series', 'Season', '9', 'first', 'Jaffa', 'are', 'now', 'charge', 'former', 'slaves', 'are', 'somewhat', 'brutish', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'Gould', 'overlords', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'even', 'had', 'flaw', 'arrogance', 'Ori', 'too', 'much', 'Christians', 'RELIGIOUS', 'FANATICS', 'coming', 'get', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'character', 'Oneill', 'show', 'sorely', 'missed', 'Season', '9', 'always', 'thought', 'had', 'dumbass', 'character', 'see', 'how', 'was', 'needed', 'comedic', 'input', 'Teal', 'c', ""Bra'tac"", 'are', 'terrible', 'lead', 'characters', 'show', ""Bra'tac"", 'so', 'ugly', 'Teal', 'c', 'now', 'gay', 'hair', 'style', 'Carter', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'actors', 'seem', 'BORED', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'store', 'season', '10', 'Season', '9', 'offers', 'barely', 'nothing', 'awful', 'confusing', 'episodes', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'capable', 'new', 'General', 'charge', 'daughter', 'doctor', 'ok', 'attractive', 'writing', 'season', '9', 'though', 'writers', 'were', 'material', 'think', 'season', '7', 'writers', 'thought', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'cancelled', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'where', 'sort', 'own', 'cancellation', 'episodes', 'almost', 'anticipate', 'cancellation', 'Things', 'are', 'wrapping', 'up', 'villians', 'are', 'being', 'defeated', 'relationships', 'are', 'playing', 'out', 'People', 'are', 'moving', 'always', 'thought', 'Gould', 'symbiotes', 'Jaffa', 'nonsense', 'was', 'borderline', 'gross', 'stupid', 'best', 'show', 'was', 'clever', 'creative', 'was', 'good', 'fun', 'science', 'fiction', 'Season', '9', 'one', 'long', 'stupid', 'plod', 'Season', '9', 'probably', 'won', 'NEW', 'fans', 'Hopefully', 'season', '10', 'will', 'have', 'old', 'writing', 'spark', 'am', 'having', 'trouble', 'watching', 'rest', 'season', '9', 'though', 'only', 'review', 'seasons', 'review', 'basically', 'marking', 'dramatic', 'decline', 'once', 'top', 'notch', 'sci-fi', 'show']",N/A

1014788,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000HEZEY6,Robert Moore,"[340, 361]","I write this review just one day after the news that the Sci-Fi Channel has declined to renew STARGATE SG-1 for an eleventh season.  It would normally be hard to feel too bad about a show that has had ten full seasons, but it seems a shame to cancel a show that has not only demonstrated a remarkable consistency for the past ten years, but an ability to recreate itself.  The show's executive producers insist that they are not giving up yet on the series and harbor hopes of transferring it to another network.  I personally hope they succeed.  While we've had ten great years of stories about the SG-1 team, I'd welcome two or three more seasons, especially with the new team and the new threat to the galaxy introduced in Season Nine.For most STARGATE SG-1 fans, Season Eight was something of a disappointment.  It was no secret that Richard Dean Anderson was burnt out and wanted to leave the show.  When SG-1 went into the field it was as a trio and not as a quartet, and Anderson's anarchic sense of humor was severely missed.  The show clearly needed to change if it was going to continue to be worth watching.  When Anderson left the show at the end of Season Eight, some fans lost all interest in the show.  But Ben Browder in replacing Anderson brought some fan interest of his own, having starred in the critically acclaimed, fan favorite, and tragically cancelled FARSCAPE.  Although for many fans Browder could not fully replace Anderson, he definitely brought a great deal to the show.  And most important, he helped restore some balance to the cast by injecting some of the same irreverence that Anderson had.Season 9 was unfortunately interrupted by real life concerns.  Both Amanda Tapping and newcomer Claudia Black had their participation in the show interfered with by pregnancy.  Tapping missed the first part of the season having her baby, while Black, who was to be an ongoing part time character, had her participation limited to several episodes at the beginning and  a couple at the very end.  As delighted as I am that Black was able to have a child, from the standpoint of the show her unavailability was unfortunate, since she instantly brought an energy and sense of outrageousness that the show had always lacked.  Of course, we didn't know this until she appeared, but it became obvious from her guest appearance in Season 8.  Black and Ben Browder had, of course, played the star-crossed lovers Aeryn Sun and John Crichton on FARSCAPE, and I was somewhat uncomfortable at the prospect of their appearing together on STARGATE.  They had, of course, been involved in the greatest Sci-Fi romance story in the history of TV Sci-Fi.  I was afraid that there would be attempt to throw them together on the new show.  Luckily, the writers decided to loosely pair Claudia Black's Vala with Michael Shanks's Daniel Jackson instead of Ben Browder's Cameron Mitchell.  Nonetheless, the presence of Black and Browder on the show caused many fans to refer to it as FARGATE.Season Eight of the show had seen the almost complete demise of the Goa'uld, so there was the need for a new enemy.  The one chosen was one particularly relevant to the times:  the Ori.  These religious fanatics go about the universe forcibly making people conform to their religious faith or killing them.  In a time when fundamentalists are rampant both in North America and the Middle East, this particular enemy has a particular topical relevance.  (There are a number of vague political references throughout SG-1.  The new president in Season 8 is said by O'Neill to be a ""shrub,"" a term that has often been used to deride George W. Bush, though all in all the show leaves its politics vague, usually refusing to explore the political ramifications of the show, largely for narrative reasons.)All in all, I thought Season Nine was a wonderful recovery after the rather listless Season Eight.  Ben Browder brought back a lot of the energy that was missing in Anderson's lessened participation in the show while Claudia Black brought a delightful outrageousness in her episodes, something that she has continued after becoming a full time character in Season Ten.  In other words, the show needed to redefine itself after Season Eight, and it did so successfully.

Well, we all know that O'Neill has gone on to running the big show at the Pentagon and that Mitchell is the new kid on the block. For me season nine and ten are far from the best of the series; with the introduction of religion to the show(which is always a touchy subject, nearly a taboo, for some SciFi franchises), the main crew drifting off to other areas of the Stargate program, the introduction of the seductive vixen - Vala and General Landry, the episodes offer storylines that are far more different than previous episodes.This episode, Beachhead, is by far one of the more imaginative episodes the writers have come up with. With the Ori Priors setting out to grow the flock, it would seem that this episode is going to be just another where SG-1 is sent out to directly face off against the Prior, however, as the episode goes on we see a great series of events unfold. Mitchell gets his first nuke experience and Vala proves to be the episodes heroine. We also some great science ingrained in the episode and even Landry gets his own storyline back on Earth.Great episode.

1014793,A1WPYY2XLOKAT8,B000HEZEY6,The Completist,"[21, 74]","Stargate is becoming more and more like DragonBall Z: a powerful villain shows up, lays waste to everything, and is finally defeated 112 episodes later only to be replaced by ANOTHER villain who makes the previous guy look like Tinkerbell.  First there was Apophis, then came Sokar, then came Anubis, then the Replicators AND Anubis again, and now in comes the Majin Buu of the SG universe: The Ori.  The long-lost ascended brethren of The Ancients, The Ori rule a galaxy far, far away with fanatical religious indoctrination and decide to extend their influence in the Milky Way when Daniel Jackson accidentally stumbles on their turf.  Making matters worse, the Ori use their ascended powers to equip their warriors with war machines that would make The Replicators turn tail and run.So essentially, the SGC is now fighting gods.  REAL gods, not the fake ones in golden robes.  It's a good thing the show has been cancelled this year because this would be a tough act to follow.I like SG-1, but I have to admit the writing has gone downhill with great speed over the years, and I feel this season is the worst.  The plots are taken in almost textbook fashion from the Star Trek manual, and the characters spend every scene re-explaining the plot to each other through unnecessary exposition.  Ben Browder and Claudia Black bring their Farscape shenanigans to the SG universe, but the show doesn't follow that energy and they end up being the resident clowns.  And Beau Bridges is an absolute turnip as a replacement for Don Davis.Since the DVDs aren't out, I can't review the discs, but they'll probably have their staple of excellent widescreen HD presentation, sporadic sprinkling of entertaining commentaries, and completely useless BTS extras.  So I can't recommend Season 9 for purchase to anyone but devout fans; this dog is on its last legs and needs to be put down.The best thing about this season is the superior CGI effects, and the refreshingly un-PC treatment of religious fanaticism, a sensitive topic these days.  The Ori are every bit as domineering as ancient gods, and their followers (led by their almost unstoppable meta-human Priors) make no bones about their campaign for religious conquest or or the killing of unbelievers.  The season finale is a surprisingly tense finish to a lame-duck season with one of the best endings I've seen in the entire series, the 3-part premiere episode is pretty solid, the season finale equally so, but aside from 3-5 decent episodes, the rest is just filler.  Bad filler.On a final note, I highly recommend checking out the episodes ""Crusade"" and ""Flesh and Blood"" for a riveting performance by newcomer Tim Guinee who's rendition of the rabidly pious Tomin is actually quite powerful and frightening.",2,An Entertainingly Senile Dog,1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,2759,"['Stargate', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'DragonBall', 'Z', 'powerful', 'villain', 'up', 'waste', 'everything', 'finally', 'defeated', '112', 'episodes', 'later', 'only', 'be', 'replaced', 'ANOTHER', 'villain', 'who', 'previous', 'guy', 'look', 'Tinkerbell', 'First', 'was', 'Apophis', 'then', 'came', 'Sokar', 'then', 'came', 'Anubis', 'then', 'Replicators', 'AND', 'Anubis', 'again', 'now', 'Majin', 'Buu', 'SG', 'universe', 'Ori', 'long-lost', 'ascended', 'brethren', 'Ancients', 'Ori', 'rule', 'galaxy', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'fanatical', 'religious', 'indoctrination', 'decide', 'extend', 'influence', 'Milky', 'Way', 'when', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'accidentally', 'turf', 'Making', 'matters', 'worse', 'Ori', 'use', 'ascended', 'powers', 'equip', 'warriors', 'war', 'machines', 'would', 'make', 'Replicators', 'turn', 'tail', 'run.So', 'essentially', 'SGC', 'now', 'fighting', 'gods', 'REAL', 'gods', 'not', 'fake', 'ones', 'golden', 'robes', 'good', 'thing', 'show', 'been', 'cancelled', 'year', 'would', 'be', 'tough', 'act', 'follow.I', 'SG-1', 'have', 'admit', 'writing', 'gone', 'downhill', 'great', 'speed', 'years', 'feel', 'season', 'worst', 'plots', 'are', 'taken', 'almost', 'textbook', 'fashion', 'Star', 'Trek', 'manual', 'characters', 'spend', 'scene', 're-explaining', 'plot', 'other', 'unnecessary', 'exposition', 'Ben', 'Browder', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'bring', 'Farscape', 'shenanigans', 'SG', 'universe', 'show', ""n't"", 'follow', 'energy', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'resident', 'clowns', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'absolute', 'turnip', 'replacement', 'Don', 'Davis.Since', 'DVDs', 'are', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'review', 'discs', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'have', 'staple', 'excellent', 'widescreen', 'HD', 'presentation', 'sporadic', 'sprinkling', 'entertaining', 'commentaries', 'completely', 'useless', 'BTS', 'extras', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Season', '9', 'purchase', 'anyone', 'devout', 'fans', 'dog', 'last', 'legs', 'be', 'put', 'down.The', 'best', 'thing', 'season', 'superior', 'CGI', 'effects', 'refreshingly', 'un-PC', 'treatment', 'religious', 'fanaticism', 'sensitive', 'topic', 'days', 'Ori', 'are', 'bit', 'as', 'domineering', 'ancient', 'gods', 'followers', 'led', 'almost', 'unstoppable', 'meta-human', 'Priors', 'make', 'bones', 'campaign', 'religious', 'conquest', 'killing', 'unbelievers', 'season', 'finale', 'surprisingly', 'tense', 'finish', 'lame-duck', 'season', 'one', 'best', 'endings', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'entire', 'series', '3-part', 'premiere', 'episode', 'pretty', 'solid', 'season', 'finale', 'equally', 'so', 'aside', '3-5', 'decent', 'episodes', 'rest', 'just', 'filler', 'Bad', 'filler.On', 'final', 'note', 'highly', 'recommend', 'checking', 'out', 'episodes', 'Crusade', 'Flesh', 'Blood', 'riveting', 'performance', 'newcomer', 'Tim', 'Guinee', 'who', 'rendition', 'rabidly', 'pious', 'Tomin', 'actually', 'quite', 'powerful', 'frightening']",N/A
