778635,A3RWR50VUII07D,B0000DGKI7,"All Red ""Red""","[5, 5]","If you are at all like I am and find that many Western films are simply not doing it for you, might I suggest a Russian film subtitled in three different languages?????It is a good thing (not Martha Stewart-like!) to have Amazon friends with which to watch, learn, observe and share.  I watched this film ""The Cuckoo"" (KUKUSHKA) by famed director Alexander Rogozskin with one friend who said to me ""You really need to see this film.  I can't think of anything like it that I have ever seen!""  WHY NOT!  So we did, and he was right!I speak only for myself when I say that this film has to be one of the most pleasantly odd (if that would be the best word to use) movies that I have ever seen.  This film tells three very separate stories, in three different languages and cultural understandings, with three unique characters who, because of World War 2 are all thrown together in a place and time and must communicate.  Shot on location in the upper regions of Asia, the story of a Finnish sniper, a disgraced Russian Captain and a native Lapp woman comes vividly, comically and tragically to life as Rogozhkin spins a tale of how humanity rises above war and death, how compassion transcends language, and how basically alike we all are as human beings.  These three ""misfits"" all desire love, sex, touch, beauty, peace and tranquility.  This is what each of them had before the War ""enlisted"" them involuntarily away from what they once knew.  War has made them resourceful in ways they probably could have never learned otherwise, but the War has become tiresome and they long, no yearn for sweet humanity once again.  What is fascinating about this film (yes you must be prepared to read subtitles!) is that each character speaks a different tongue, and you must remember that what you are reading is the character's true thoughts and not what the other character is understanding!  Once you get that point, the rest is cake!  This film was a challenge that I was up to, and I am glad that I accepted it.  When Western films are not filling the void that I so feel, I find myself turning to the East and longing for a way to view life that is not American.  This is an incredible humanitarian film that is beautifully and ingeniously rendered.  In the ""special featurette"", director Rogozhkin and members of his team make it very clear that this film could actually border ""on Boredom"" because of the solitary way in which the tale needed to be shot and told.  I never was bored.  I was transfixed and grateful that once again I had experienced something that I otherwise might have overlooked.",5,This is a one-of-a-kind.

778639,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B0000DGKI7,Christopher Culver,"[1, 1]","The 2002 Russian production KUKUSHKA (""The Cuckoo"") is an entertaining tale of mutual understanding across language barriers on the Finland-Russian front in World War II. As the film begins Veikko (Ville Haapasalo), a recently drafted Finnish student who doesn't seen the point of fighting, is being chained to a rock. Punished for insubordination, he is forced to wear an SS uniform so he won't surrender, and given a gun to shot passing Russian troops. Only a couple of kilometers away Ivan (Viktor Bychkov), a Russian soldier who has just been arrested for the counter-revolutionary activity of writing poetry, is set free when his jailers perish in a bombing. Both of these condemned men are taken in by Anni (Anni-Kristiina Juuso), a Sami woman resident in the area, who holds on to her small farm four years after her husband disappeared.Each of these three characters cannot speak the language of the others, and Ivan initially hopes to kill Veikko, whom he believes to be a Nazi soldier. The misunderstandings that arise make for fine comedy, but the final reconciliation amongst the three characters is heartwarming. The cinematography really brings out the beauty of the land above the Arctic Circle, and the writers have represented the traditions of the Sami with care. Director Aleksandr Rogozhkin has expertly handled the actors and the action.The DVD extras are quite entertaining, especially Juuso's bafflement at the suggestion that the Sami people are sex-obsessed.I watched this film as a student of Finno-Ugrian linguistics resident in Finland, passionate about the Finnish and Sami languages and with training in Russian as well. Audiences with different backgrounds might not care as much for the film, and you might find it a three-star effort instead of four.

Its plot of three people all of different cultures and speak different languages who meet and become friends is brilliant.  The layering of the three different languages blend perfectly: russian, finnish, and lapp.  The dramatic theme builds interestingly as the film reveals the characters' backgrounds.  Many conflicts arise as more secrets are revealed, especially when it's discovered that the two men are enemies.  The plot adds some humor in the perfect times.  One of the most interesting humorous scenes are when the russian soldier speaks in his native tongue what the other two think is his name: Gerlost, which actually means &quot;get lost&quot;.  Few movies accomplish keeping the audience's interest for the whole duration with only three characters throughout most of it.  Besides the plot, the actors perform their roles beautifully.  They add their own drama in the dramatic scenes and their own humor in the humorous scenes.  Without such acting quality, this movie wouldn't be nearly as interesting.  &quot;The Cuckoo&quot; is a great movie for those looking for a unique film.

778644,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0000DGKI7,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","THE CUCKOO (Kukushka) is a small miracle of a film.  It is not only a unique story but one that draws us into the individual lives of three strangers from different languages and backgrounds who bond in time of war because of their mutual isolation.  It is at once charming, gently humorous, and deeply touching.Taking place during WW II during the little known Russo-Finnish War, the setting is Lapland.  We first encounter a Finnish student/soldier Veikko (Ville Haapasalo) being chained by the Russians to a rock in a German SS uniform as punishment for his disillusionment in the war effort, thinking that he will be killed as the enemy.  In another area some Russian soldiers are transporting a Russian poet/soldier Ivan (Viktor Bychkov)  condemned for his anti-Communist stance: the jeep transporting Ivan is bombed, killing the soldiers except for Ivan.  Along comes a little Lapp girl Anni (Anni-Kristiina Juuso), finds the severely injured Ivan, drags him to her hut and nurses him back to health.  Meanwhile Veikko ingeniously frees himself from his rock and wanders into the presence of Anni.  Veikko speaks Finnish, Ivan speaks Russian and Anni (aka 'Cuckoo') speaks Sami and the three cannot understand each other's language or customs.  Ivan sees Veikko as a fascist and wants to destroy him; Veikko never wanted to be in the war anyway so he pacifies Ivan; Anni is more concerned with basic physical needs (her husband has been gone four years, conscripted by the armed forces for a war she doesn't understand and she is hungry for the presence of a man in her bed!).  The story explains the manner in which these three people intertwine their lives and beliefs and overcome the barriers of language to form a trio of true universal family.  The war ends and the three 'bodies' separate, leaving behind indelible evidence of their transforming experiences.Writer/director Aleksandr Rogozhkin has created a masterpiece, a film brimming with beauty of visuals, of warmly humorous exchanges of dialog understood only by each speaker, of survival and of the mystery of life beyond.  The acting is superb, the cinematography is breathtaking, and the message is deeply moving. In the field of strong anti-war statements, THE CUCKOO is the most sincere.  A brilliant achievement!

High praise indeed for what directors/ artistes long for!""The Cuckoo"" is so uniquely original in my experience as a lover of film, it is quite a struggle to express how I feel about the film.  Perhaps that is the point!.. ""The Cuckoo"" is a simple, yet deeply metaphorical story, taking place towards the conclusion of WW2 in Upper Lapland, Finland. where a condemned Finnish sniper, a Court Marshalled Russian soldier, and a young Lapland widow, who speak three different languages are brought together and learn how to communicate beyond words.  Each character has become resourceful in his/her own right as the War has forced them to be.  Each character had been something and someone different before the War, and now, as the War is ending, each must decide who they will become.  Each babbles on at each other in their own tongues, never apologising or trying to understand the other.  Some of this is quite comical, as what each person thinks they are understanding is not what is actually communicated at all!  What IS divulged to the viewer, in a very clever way, is the entire backstory of each character WITHOUT the characters themselves EVER understanding that backstory.  What we see on screen, then, is how love, compassion and humanity are communicate; so as you can see this is a very different kind of a film!..The audience knows what the characters do not, but the characters learn what the audience can only observe.

Cox,"[3, 6]","A neat little Rusiian film that takes place in September of 1944, a few days before Finland dropped out of WWII, about a Finnish soldier (Veikko) dressed as a SS officer who was chained to a rock by Germans and left to die, a Russian soldier (Ivan) who is being taken to be court-martialed by his troops when a overpassing war plane kills everyone but him, and the Lapp woman (Anni) who finds both of them and takes them in.Anni lives a simple life, living out of a hovel on the water and catching fish to survive. Her husband has been dead for years, so having these two men in her home, even if no one speaks a word of each other's language, is still a bonus for her. And therein lies the crux of the humor here. All three of these characters are total chatterboxes, yet no one understands a word anyone else is saying. It makes for some unexpectedly laugh-out-loud situations, and as the film plays out the characters become very well-defined and we see that language is clearly not the only impenetrable barrier between these three.The first half hour of this film is just set-up, as we get introductions to the three characters and their dilemmas. Not much funny going on. But once they meet, it all becomes very enjoyable, and even a well-filmed but somewhat morbid scene with Anni calling one of them back from the &quot;paths of the dead&quot; doesn't change the pace, so much as it gives Anni a greater depth for us.",4,What a neat little soft-spoken comedy,1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,1425,"['neat', 'little', 'Rusiian', 'film', 'place', 'September', '1944', 'few', 'days', 'Finland', 'dropped', 'WWII', 'Finnish', 'soldier', 'Veikko', 'dressed', 'SS', 'officer', 'who', 'was', 'chained', 'rock', 'Germans', 'left', 'die', 'Russian', 'soldier', 'Ivan', 'who', 'being', 'taken', 'be', 'court-martialed', 'troops', 'when', 'overpassing', 'war', 'plane', 'everyone', 'Lapp', 'woman', 'Anni', 'who', 'in.Anni', 'simple', 'life', 'living', 'hovel', 'water', 'catching', 'fish', 'survive', 'husband', 'been', 'dead', 'years', 'so', 'having', 'two', 'men', 'home', 'even', 'one', 'word', 'other', 'language', 'still', 'bonus', 'therein', 'crux', 'humor', 'here', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'total', 'chatterboxes', 'yet', 'one', 'word', 'anyone', 'else', 'saying', 'unexpectedly', 'laugh-out-loud', 'situations', 'film', 'out', 'characters', 'become', 'very', 'well-defined', 'see', 'language', 'clearly', 'not', 'only', 'impenetrable', 'barrier', 'three.The', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'just', 'set-up', 'get', 'introductions', 'three', 'characters', 'dilemmas', 'Not', 'much', 'funny', 'going', 'once', 'meet', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'well-filmed', 'somewhat', 'morbid', 'scene', 'Anni', 'calling', 'one', 'back', 'quot', 'paths', 'dead', 'quot', ""n't"", 'change', 'pace', 'so', 'much', 'Anni', 'greater', 'depth']",The Cuckoo
778649,A2ODBHT4URXVXQ,B0000DGKI7,"Peggy Vincent ""author and reader""","[89, 91]","What an extraordinary movie! I was confused at the beginning, as were the 3 people with whom I was watching this ultimately marvelous film. We couldn't figure out why the guy was being chained to the rock, who was on which side of the war, what languages they were speaking. But with a little patience and perseverance, it all becomes crystal clear and the movie soars to the stratosphere. Ten stars.The whole movie is set in Lappland, home of the ethnic Sami people. There's a pacifist-Finnish-conscript-sniper-prisoner of the Russians (got all that?) who is chained to the rock and left to die (dressed in an SS uniform) because he just doesn't want to fight any more. Didn't want to fight in the first place. Most of the beginning of the movie is taken up with his persistent and ingenious attempts to free himself from the chains - and I think it was all of those schemes that kept my 18yo son fascinated. By the time the bolt came loose from the stone, my kid was hooked on `the real story,' and, in spite of hating subtitles, he stuck around to the end and loved it.Okay, stay with me here. Then there's a Russian prisoner of his own countrymen being taken to trial for the anti-Communist views found in his diaries. The jeep with the Russian is bombed; only the prisoner survives, but he's badly concussed.And there's an utterly charming and luminous young Sami woman living alone (her husband was taken off 4 yrs earlier as a conscript) on a spit of land in a beautiful but pretty barren wilderness who ends up with both men in her hut. None of them speak a common language. The subtitles are hilarious as they babble on incessantly to each other with only occasional glimmers of real communication and understanding. But somehow they forge bonds, the seasons pass, the odd romances blossom and wane - and at the back of the whole story is one of the strongest anti-war messages I've ever seen.Anni-Christina Juuso, the Sami actress, is nothing short of extraordinary.The ending is touchingly beautiful, perfectly fitting for this touchingly beautiful film.See it now.",5,"Extraordinary, funny, inspirational, beautiful",1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,2076,"['What', 'extraordinary', 'movie', 'was', 'confused', 'beginning', 'were', '3', 'people', 'whom', 'was', 'watching', 'ultimately', 'marvelous', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'guy', 'was', 'being', 'chained', 'rock', 'who', 'was', 'side', 'war', 'what', 'were', 'speaking', 'little', 'patience', 'perseverance', 'crystal', 'clear', 'movie', 'stratosphere', 'Ten', 'stars.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'set', 'Lappland', 'home', 'ethnic', 'Sami', 'people', 'pacifist-Finnish-conscript-sniper-prisoner', 'Russians', 'got', 'who', 'chained', 'rock', 'left', 'die', 'dressed', 'SS', 'uniform', 'just', ""n't"", 'want', 'fight', 'more', 'Did', ""n't"", 'want', 'fight', 'first', 'place', 'Most', 'beginning', 'movie', 'taken', 'up', 'persistent', 'ingenious', 'attempts', 'free', 'chains', 'think', 'was', 'schemes', 'kept', '18yo', 'son', 'fascinated', 'time', 'bolt', 'came', 'loose', 'stone', 'kid', 'was', 'hooked', 'real', 'story', 'spite', 'hating', 'subtitles', 'stuck', 'around', 'end', 'loved', 'it.Okay', 'stay', 'here', 'Then', 'Russian', 'prisoner', 'own', 'countrymen', 'being', 'taken', 'trial', 'anti-Communist', 'views', 'found', 'diaries', 'jeep', 'Russian', 'bombed', 'only', 'prisoner', 'badly', 'concussed.And', 'utterly', 'charming', 'luminous', 'young', 'Sami', 'woman', 'living', 'alone', 'husband', 'was', 'taken', 'off', '4', 'yrs', 'earlier', 'conscript', 'spit', 'land', 'beautiful', 'pretty', 'barren', 'wilderness', 'who', 'up', 'men', 'hut', 'None', 'speak', 'common', 'language', 'subtitles', 'are', 'hilarious', 'babble', 'incessantly', 'other', 'only', 'occasional', 'glimmers', 'real', 'communication', 'understanding', 'somehow', 'forge', 'bonds', 'seasons', 'pass', 'odd', 'romances', 'blossom', 'wane', 'back', 'whole', 'story', 'one', 'strongest', 'anti-war', 'messages', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Anni-Christina', 'Juuso', 'Sami', 'actress', 'nothing', 'short', 'extraordinary.The', 'ending', 'touchingly', 'beautiful', 'perfectly', 'fitting', 'touchingly', 'beautiful', 'film.See', 'now']",The Cuckoo

We meet Finish soldier who is abandoned to die because he refuses to fight any more; Russian soldier on his way to excution who is deemed not loyal and Lapp woman who has spent last four years alone fighting for her own survival and waiting for her husband to come back from the war.  These three people strike unlikely bond, which is even more amazing considering that they each speak different language.  We learn thru their interaction that they deeply care about each other -- but in their own ways.  They also seem to want to think that whatever it is that they are thinking is what the other person is thinking too.  So it comes this wonderful tale about three people who live real life together close to the very end of the war, but at the same time they all build their own reality too.  I particularly liked the female character who is strong, self-sifficient adn resourceful.  She knows what she wants and goes for it.  She is an enchatress, hunter, cook, wife, lover and mother.  It is almost funny when a Russian soldier calls woman like that, living all alone in the cold mountain ""stupid woman"", considering she managed to survive on her own for all that time.

Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","[10, 12]",Somewhere in the isolated and stark Lapland countryside a few days before Finland pulls out of World War II a Finnish sniper is chained to a rock after being accused of being a pacifist and a reluctant fighter. After he is deserted and left for dead he struggles and perseveres to unhinge the chains and break free. He then befriends a Lapp woman farmer and an AWOL Russian soldier on the farm and hides until he can safely return home. What follows is a marvelous film of friendship between unlikely individuals in difficult circumstances. There are obvious language barriers between the three but they continue speaking with each other in their own tongues. The farm is almost completely self-sufficient so there is much hard work to do before the winter sets in. In addition there are apparent romantic feelings between the farmer and one of the soldiers that leaves the other feeling bad. All three elements add for an interesting DVD experience.The cinematography of THE CUCKOO is excellent and the story is captivating.

His die-hard and innovative attempts to get rid of the shackles whilst complaining about the war, are simply hilarious (the actor's silent facial expressions are most impressive). The  Russian soldier/prisoner (Ivan) is stranded in a foreign land and is ever suspicious. The pastoral Sami woman (Anni played by Anni-Kristiina Juuso)steals the show with her top-notch acting.

Anni thinks mushrooms will give Ivan a bad stomach. She prepares an infusion and (kindly) offers it to Ivan, who gladly drinks appreciating the wonderful taste. The infusion is in fact a potent laxative that takes immediate affect.All in all a wonderful movie from Russia that reaffirms the beauty of life and the futility of war.

How would three people with different languages and different cultures interact, especially if two of them are enemies? This film explores that question. The performances were outstanding, and the film was beautifully and artisticly done. Much of it was very funny, as the audience is let in on both what WAS being said and what was THOUGHT to be being said. One example of this is Ivan being called Gerlost as if that is his name because he is always telling Veiko to get lost. Even people who speak the same language have a hard time communicating.

One is a Finnish soldier, a disgraced sharp-shooter, chained to a rock by his countrymen, left to the mercy of the enemy. The second is a Russian soldier, charged with some frivolous ""offense"" by the battalion commisar. The third character is a young Sami woman. Living alone in the forest for quite some time, she has no idea where her husband is, after he left to serve in the Finnish army. Fate and war throws them all together.The Finn and the Russian are intellectuals. The Finn was a university student before the war, the Russian is a well-known poet. The Sami woman is a true child of the earth, and is merely greatful to finally have some company in her remote corner of the wilderness.None of them can speak the others' language!Yet, they ""understand"" each other in ways that they don't fully comprehend. In this surreal setting and circumstance, they attempt to ""speak"" to each other anyway. Knowing full-well that neither of them are really ""listening"", are they REALLY talking to each other, ...or to themselves?A testament to the universal human need for fellowship of some sort, amidst enormous chaotic events, this film is yet another example of the many unique, high-quality films still coming from Europe.For those purely interested in the World War II aspect of the story, its an illustration of how vast the war was in its many fronts, major and minor, and its influence on people in even the most obscure regions of the world. In this case, the background is the ""Lappland War"", in which Finland was forced to break its alliance with Germany, as the Soviet Union prevailed in driving German forces westward. In fact, theres a very brief scene, in which the characters observe a small party of German troops evacuating wounded personnel, accompanied by a nurse, ...presumably the aftermath of some distant battle.
