661074,A35ZB30NLZDD8P,B00005K9NW,"aravyn ""tbaa_andrea""","[8, 11]","I don't understand this Super Sayian thing. I never saw any advertisements for there being any mention of Goku Turning Super Sayian. And as for someone who said the Namek turning into a giant was a stupid idea...maybe...but it did happen in Dragon Ball (before DBZ) near the end of the series when Piccolo fought Goku as Ma Junior. So its not like they just tossed that in there and hoped everyone liked it. It was something that people know Nameks can do, if they've seen DB or read the Dragon Ball Mangas. Some may not have known this since I don't think it happened at all in DBZ.I loved the idea of using the awesome heavy metal sound track in the back ground of the English cut. The way it was soft during the talking, then boomed when the action began, and I thought the fight scenes were pretty cool. Tree of might was my favorite until seeing Lord Slug. I think this movie was made pretty well. Great soundtrack, love the voice actors, the animation was better than in the earlier movies, the plot may not be origional, but at least it had a plot. Anyone who has seen the release of Angel Links, a really bad waste of money, would have to agree with me on that.I think this is a great movie for those who are DB, DBZ and DBGT fans. I agree that if you're not a DBZ fan you may not get into it, but hey, thats with any movie. If you're not a martial arts fan, why watch a Jackie Chan flick? If you don't like &quot;chick Flicks&quot; Why go see &quot;Moulan Rouge&quot;?This is just a matter of love/hate. You either have to love DBZ, or you won't like the movie. Thankfully, I LOVE DBZ!!

661075,A22R7DOWO8O9V9,B00005K9NW,C. Hrozencik,"[1, 1]",Ok first of all all the Dragon Ball Z moive reviewrs saw that this is the worst DBZ moive of all. WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!! This is the best DBZ movie yet it's full of action every secound and the music is awsome to. What I was suprised the most about was that there was fighting after only 5 minuits of the movie. Ok about the movie. The movie starts of with Gohan showing Piccilo how Iikrus can dance after about a few secounds Piccilo tells Gohan to stop it and that he senses something heading towerd earth. After Bulmas dad looks at it he says that it's a star crusier heading towerd earth. Not only chould it dystroy earth but it's inhabited. After the cruiser lands Lordslugs army comes out telling everybody that the planet is under Lordslugs control now. Normaly Goku would show up but while trying to stop the cruiser him and Krillin where knocked out. Gohan trys to dystroy all of the army but after loseing his hat Lordslug takes the Dragon ball and tells him that he knows all about them. After Bulma and her big mouth tell him about the rader Lordslug reads Bulmas mind and takes the Radar he and his army rounds up the army to find all the Dragon balls. After finding them Lordslug ask Shenron to give him etrnal youth sense he is getting close to death. After that Lordslugs heach man defeat Gohan And Picclio but Goku finlly comes and kills them quickly. But theres one Problem with all his power restored Goku can't defeat Lordslug with his power level. Can Goku find a way to dystroy Lordslug? Or is this the end of the world? Not only the actions good but the music rocks too. I'll give this one 10/10 defintly worth the money. P.S. Don't buy this in the box set with movies 5 and 6 there edited buy them seprtly if you want them uncut.,5,Better then Fusion Reborn!!!,1147046400,"05 8, 2006",2006,1768,"['Ok', 'first', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'moive', 'reviewrs', 'saw', 'worst', 'DBZ', 'moive', 'WHAT', 'HECK', 'ARE', 'YOU', 'TALKING', 'best', 'DBZ', 'movie', 'yet', 'full', 'action', 'secound', 'music', 'awsome', 'What', 'was', 'suprised', 'most', 'was', 'was', 'fighting', 'only', '5', 'minuits', 'movie', 'movie', 'movie', 'Gohan', 'showing', 'Piccilo', 'how', 'Iikrus', 'can', 'dance', 'few', 'secounds', 'Piccilo', 'Gohan', 'stop', 'something', 'heading', 'towerd', 'earth', 'Bulmas', 'dad', 'star', 'crusier', 'heading', 'towerd', 'earth', 'Not', 'only', 'chould', 'dystroy', 'earth', 'inhabited', 'cruiser', 'Lordslugs', 'army', 'out', 'telling', 'everybody', 'planet', 'Lordslugs', 'control', 'now', 'Normaly', 'Goku', 'would', 'show', 'up', 'trying', 'stop', 'cruiser', 'Krillin', 'where', 'knocked', 'out', 'Gohan', 'trys', 'dystroy', 'army', 'loseing', 'hat', 'Lordslug', 'Dragon', 'ball', 'Bulma', 'big', 'mouth', 'tell', 'rader', 'Lordslug', 'Bulmas', 'mind', 'Radar', 'army', 'up', 'army', 'find', 'Dragon', 'balls', 'finding', 'Lordslug', 'ask', 'Shenron', 'give', 'etrnal', 'youth', 'sense', 'getting', 'close', 'death', 'Lordslugs', 'heach', 'man', 'defeat', 'Gohan', 'Picclio', 'Goku', 'finlly', 'quickly', 'one', 'Problem', 'power', 'restored', 'Goku', 'ca', ""n't"", 'defeat', 'Lordslug', 'power', 'level', 'Can', 'Goku', 'find', 'way', 'dystroy', 'Lordslug', 'end', 'world', 'Not', 'only', 'actions', 'good', 'music', 'too', ""'ll"", 'give', 'one', '10/10', 'defintly', 'money', 'P.S', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'box', 'set', 'movies', '5', '6', 'there', 'edited', 'buy', 'seprtly', 'want', 'uncut']",N/A
661076,A3KRWU9KOJHN02,B00005K9NW,Craig Juan,"[2, 3]","Sorry to say, but even if I own this movie, Dragonball Z: Lord Slug is the worst among all of the DBZ movies. But don't get me wrong here. This is not the only worst movie. There are other DBZ movies that (stink) like the movies featuring the character Broly, the ultimate Super Saiyan. Anyway let me explain this movie. The animation is top-notch. As always, Akira Toriyama is always letting his ideas do the hard work creating superb looking characters (including the main villain Lord Slug. He looks like a pumped up version of Piccolo !), the quality of the energy beams, and the blood spills. The comedy, which lasts for about a few seconds, is awesome. Everyone likes the part where Gohan and Icarus annoys Piccolo with their whistling music and the part when the news reporter Hashimoto freaks out. The part where Piccolo sweats with irritation and screams out really made me laugh. The action is okay. Pretty much the same old traditional aerial battles from the previous 3 movies (all three of the early DBZ movies are better than this one), but some raw violence and excitement are found here. The best parts of the violence are when Lord Slug blasts his men who oppose and offend him, and when Piccolo goes into battle with one of Lord Slug's henchmen. And the music, perfectly matches the action and dramatic sequences perfectly. Now for the bad side. The way the story went, it was too darn short. I was pretty much expecting a long lasting plot like the one from Dragonball Z: The Worlds Strongest. I was very disappointed when it ended at a short time. Sure the action was amazing, but then again, it wears off during the battle with Goku and Lord Slug. The action really got boring with all of the same moves. And what's the deal with this so-called, ""Super Saiyan transformation"" ? Goku is just surrounded by yellow energy with no pupils. That is not Super Saiyan. When he becomes Super Saiyan, his hair is supposed to be yellow and the pupils in his eyes are supposed to be green, not lit up with yellow flames and pupilless eyes. What were they thinking ? That is one thing they really (messed) up on. No ! This is not FUNimation's fault this time ! It's the people who worked on the movie. It's their fault ! And I kept on asking myself, ""why can't Lord Slug be much better than movies #1, #2, and #3 ?"". To others, it's a total waste of money, but if you're anything like me and you're very anxious to see every DBZ movie in English, none of us members from Amazon or any fan of DBZ will not try to stop you. All-in-all, this is the worst DBZ movie ever, but it still has its great moments. Like I said, if you want to see all of the DBZ movies so badly, we're not holding you back, so go ahead.Note: The 5th movie ""Dragonball Z: Cooler's Revenge"" will come out Jan. 2002 and it will be way better than all four of the DBZ movies.

Rutledge ""Superpope""","[0, 1]","Okay, so Funimation seems to just grab people off the street to dub the voices for their English DBZ dubs, and they mess up the original plots and music.  At least they've started giving us the option to view the movies in the original Japanese with directly translated subtitles!The plot finds Goku saving Earth from the evil alien Slug and his minions, who wish to envelop us in eternal night.  The most annoying thing to me about Funimation's treatment of this film is their inexplicable changing of Gohan's cute little whistling song.Many of the Dragon Ball Z movies fall in a sort of ""alternate timeline"" from the comic and TV show...they could never have really taken place at the times that they do.  For example, this movie has Goku and friends on Earth at the time when they were all either dead or on planet Namek.  Goku is at the point developmentally where it is known that he is the Super Saiyan, but hasn't ever ""gone blonde"" yet.All of the DBZ movies have faster paced action and more exciting fights than the TV show, which are sometimes drawn out over several episodes.

I then watched it in the English language and was very impressed. Whomever translated this took a fan's artistic license with the dialog. Weak reasoning and poor direction from the original nearly vanished, and out came a more true to the saga movie.P.S.  I believe Goku to have actually gone Ultra Saiya-Jin in this movie, not Super Saiya-Jin.  For example, he powered up, his eyes went pure white, and his speed didn't appear to increase.

After the Z-team deflects an asteroid from hitting the Earth, an alien craft filled with nasty but light-sensitive aliens lands on Earth and begins to cover it with dark clouds. They are led by an incredibly aged Namek who is still a very powerful warrior. When he sees a Dragon Ball, he recognizes it for what it is and has his people gather them and wishes himself back to full power.There are some decent fight sequences in this (Piccolo gets some very cool moments), but overall it's not all that great. The ending has a nice moment -- a sort of prequel of the later &quot;fusion technique&quot; shown in the Buu sequence -- but there are sufficient stupid or pedestrian moments which drop this back down to a so-so entertainment effort.",3,An average venture for DBZ,1066089600,"10 14, 2003",2003,1025,"['Noted', 'mainly', 'fearsome', 'quot', 'Whistle', 'Doom', 'quot', 'happy', 'perky', 'whistled', 'tune', 'just', 'be', 'pitch', 'range', 'Namek-seijin', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'imagine', 'thousand', 'scraping', 'down', 'blackboard', 'even', 'DBZ', 'pretty', 'lightweight', 'offering', 'Z-team', 'asteroid', 'hitting', 'Earth', 'alien', 'craft', 'filled', 'nasty', 'light-sensitive', 'aliens', 'Earth', 'cover', 'dark', 'clouds', 'are', 'led', 'incredibly', 'aged', 'Namek', 'who', 'still', 'very', 'powerful', 'warrior', 'When', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'what', 'people', 'gather', 'back', 'full', 'power.There', 'are', 'decent', 'fight', 'sequences', 'Piccolo', 'very', 'cool', 'moments', 'overall', 'not', 'great', 'ending', 'nice', 'moment', 'sort', 'prequel', 'later', 'quot', 'fusion', 'technique', 'quot', 'shown', 'Buu', 'sequence', 'are', 'sufficient', 'stupid', 'pedestrian', 'moments', 'drop', 'back', 'down', 'so-so', 'entertainment', 'effort']",N/A

However, FUNimation does tend to have the characters say rather ridiculous things during intense battles for I have no idea why; and I've found some grammatical errors that do tend to be rather annoying at times.  At the back of the DVD case, it said &quot;May contain violence and brief nudity,&quot; which didn't make sense to me at all.  This movie DOES contain violent scenes, but I didn't find any which included nudity.The story itself is rather weak and rather clich&eacute;.  Some evil planet/asteroid thing appears and threatens the entire existence of the Earth.  A big mess happens and Goku always manages to win in the end.  However, there is a nice twist with the villains having to make the atmosphere breathable in order to use Earth as their new cruiser-thing.What rather bugged me was Goku's Super Saiya-jin transformation.  His hair didn't even turn gold, which allows a lot of people to say, &quot;He didn't even turn Super Saiya-jin, so, why is it in the movie's title?&quot;Also, the dub's music tend to disturb me from time to time.  They mostly used music from hard rock groups in the soundtrack (not that any of the groups are bad or anything), and this itself didn't bother me, it just seems when the music cued in, it didn't seem very appropriate at all.  At times, it ruined the drama and the suspense of certain scenes which you could definately feel in the subtitled version.So, really, this movie does have its weak points, and its strong points, so they're pretty much even.  This isn't my favourite DBZ movie, but this doesn't mean it'll stop me from watching this again.",3,Not a bad movie...,1009670400,"12 30, 2001",2001,1722,"['have', 'watched', 'dubbed', 'subbed', 'versions', 'DVD', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'rather', 'impressed', 'However', 'FUNimation', 'tend', 'have', 'characters', 'say', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'intense', 'battles', 'have', 'idea', 'why', ""'ve"", 'found', 'grammatical', 'errors', 'do', 'tend', 'be', 'rather', 'annoying', 'times', 'back', 'DVD', 'case', 'said', 'quot', 'May', 'contain', 'violence', 'brief', 'nudity', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'movie', 'DOES', 'contain', 'violent', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'included', 'nudity.The', 'story', 'rather', 'weak', 'rather', 'clich', 'eacute', 'evil', 'planet/asteroid', 'thing', 'entire', 'existence', 'Earth', 'big', 'mess', 'happens', 'Goku', 'always', 'win', 'end', 'However', 'nice', 'twist', 'villains', 'having', 'make', 'atmosphere', 'breathable', 'order', 'use', 'Earth', 'new', 'cruiser-thing.What', 'rather', 'bugged', 'was', 'Goku', 'Super', 'Saiya-jin', 'transformation', 'hair', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'turn', 'gold', 'lot', 'people', 'say', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'turn', 'Super', 'Saiya-jin', 'so', 'why', 'movie', 'title', 'quot', 'Also', 'dub', 'music', 'tend', 'disturb', 'time', 'time', 'mostly', 'used', 'music', 'hard', 'rock', 'groups', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'groups', 'are', 'bad', 'anything', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'just', 'when', 'music', 'cued', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'appropriate', 'times', 'ruined', 'drama', 'suspense', 'certain', 'scenes', 'could', 'definately', 'feel', 'subtitled', 'version.So', 'really', 'movie', 'have', 'weak', 'points', 'strong', 'points', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'even', ""n't"", 'favourite', 'DBZ', 'movie', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'watching', 'again']",N/A

It is really entertaining but it doesn't tie in to the basic story line, so forget about it.The story once again takes place after they meet Trunks, but before they face the androids.  This time it starts off with a giant ateroid shooting straight for Earth, and there is no way that the military can destroy it.  In comes Goku adn Krillion who use their abilities to try and divert it, but end up destroying it.  They now dissapear for the first half.  In the mean time from the depths of Ateroid lands a space ship that belongs to Lord Slug.  He is very old and close to death, until he discovers the Dragon Balls.  So before he converts Earth into a barren wasteland that will be his ship he gathers the Dragon balls and makes his wish.  During the intial attack however when they land there are only two people to oppose the troops. Gohan and in a surprising turn of events Chi-Chi.  Eventually however Goku, Krillion, and Piccolo show up and the battles continue.Like I said this is another 45 minute short film that only die hard DBZ fans would enjoy.  If you onlyu casually watch the series or don't like to spend the money than this might not be worth the time.  It has as much action as the series but you just won't find this in any way connected to the main story line.  This is basicaly for hard core DBZ fans.",5,Another side episode you won't see on TV,1018396800,"04 10, 2002",2002,1450,"['one', 'mini', 'movies', 'wanted', 'could', 'expand', 'movie', '2', 'part', 'tv', 'special', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'entertaining', ""n't"", 'tie', 'basic', 'story', 'line', 'so', 'forget', 'it.The', 'story', 'once', 'again', 'place', 'meet', 'Trunks', 'face', 'androids', 'time', 'giant', 'ateroid', 'shooting', 'straight', 'Earth', 'way', 'military', 'can', 'destroy', 'Goku', 'adn', 'Krillion', 'who', 'use', 'abilities', 'try', 'divert', 'end', 'up', 'destroying', 'now', 'dissapear', 'first', 'half', 'mean', 'time', 'depths', 'Ateroid', 'space', 'ship', 'Lord', 'Slug', 'very', 'old', 'close', 'death', 'Dragon', 'Balls', 'So', 'Earth', 'barren', 'wasteland', 'will', 'be', 'ship', 'Dragon', 'balls', 'wish', 'intial', 'attack', 'however', 'when', 'land', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'oppose', 'troops', 'Gohan', 'surprising', 'turn', 'events', 'Chi-Chi', 'Eventually', 'however', 'Goku', 'Krillion', 'Piccolo', 'show', 'up', 'battles', 'continue.Like', 'said', '45', 'minute', 'short', 'film', 'only', 'die', 'hard', 'DBZ', 'fans', 'would', 'enjoy', 'onlyu', 'casually', 'watch', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'spend', 'money', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'time', 'as', 'much', 'action', 'series', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'way', 'connected', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'basicaly', 'hard', 'core', 'DBZ', 'fans']",N/A
