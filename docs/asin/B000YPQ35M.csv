There's only 3 type of exercises in each segment for the Upper and Lower Body Blasts and it's repeated three times .  By the third time, the user would follow the program easily.  What I like about the DVD is that real women are doing these exercises, not beautiful models.

I like to try new ones to add variety to my collection and I only keep the ones that are perfect. Well, this one is one of those. I had tried a couple of older videos with Tracy and didn't like them at all. So, I was hesitant with this one, but couldn't ignore all of the 5-star reviews. I'm glad I didn't. This workout (playing all) is pretty intense, and I admit I used much heavier weights than Tracy and her team, but it was a blast. I felt completely worked out in a good way. What I also really liked is that she always did a group of 3 exercises and then repeated them 3 times. So, if you didn't get it right, or the weight was too light the first time you could then adjust it in the next 2 sets.

1120388,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000YPQ35M,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[1, 1]",Tracey Mallett has created workouts that really make you work at an intense level yet instead of feeling tired after doing these exercises you are likely to feel energized and very much alive. The workouts are divided into 6-minute sections. Each 6-minute section is further divided up into 30 second exercises. All the exercises are easy to do and are mostly low impact except for one jumping exercise that can be modified. Even though I wasn't doing the exercises quite as fast as Tracey Mallett I still felt like I got an excellent workout. I did the entire workout all at once instead of just 6 minutes a day. There is a warm up and a cool down stretch segment as well. You can choose which workouts you want to do or do them all in a row. Also you don't have to have a ball if you know how to modify the exercises. You will probably get a better workout if you have one as then you'll add a balance challenge to all the exercises. So I'd recommend this to intermediate exercisers. I used 5-lb weight the whole time but you can use 3-lb weights on some of the exercises if you prefer.~The Rebecca Review,5,Energizing,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,1107,"['Tracey', 'Mallett', 'created', 'workouts', 'really', 'make', 'work', 'intense', 'level', 'yet', 'instead', 'feeling', 'tired', 'doing', 'exercises', 'are', 'likely', 'feel', 'energized', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'workouts', 'are', 'divided', '6-minute', 'sections', '6-minute', 'section', 'further', 'divided', 'up', '30', 'second', 'exercises', 'exercises', 'are', 'easy', 'do', 'are', 'mostly', 'low', 'impact', 'one', 'jumping', 'exercise', 'can', 'be', 'modified', 'Even', 'was', ""n't"", 'doing', 'exercises', 'quite', 'as', 'fast', 'Tracey', 'Mallett', 'still', 'felt', 'got', 'excellent', 'workout', 'did', 'entire', 'workout', 'once', 'instead', 'just', '6', 'minutes', 'day', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'stretch', 'segment', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'choose', 'workouts', 'want', 'do', 'do', 'row', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'ball', 'know', 'how', 'modify', 'exercises', 'will', 'probably', 'get', 'better', 'workout', 'have', 'one', 'then', ""'ll"", 'add', 'balance', 'challenge', 'exercises', 'So', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'intermediate', 'exercisers', 'used', '5-lb', 'weight', 'whole', 'time', 'can', 'use', '3-lb', 'weights', 'exercises', 'prefer.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",Tracey Mallett's 6 Minute Quick Blast Method-Total Body Fat Burner
1120389,A1T6VABQU7RBMA,B000YPQ35M,T. Carr,"[4, 4]","UPDATE: For some reason, Amazon won't let you review the set separately from the individual dvds. My detailed review which I get to in a minute is for one dvd, Total Body Fat Burner, in her 4 dvd set (Tracey Mallett: Quickblast Method 4-pack). The individual dvd gets 4 stars but as for the SET, I'd give it 2 stars. I'd save your money and only buyTracey Mallett's 6 Minute Quick Blast Method-Total Body Calorie BlastandTracey Mallett's 6 Minute Quick Blast Method-Total Body Fat Burner, as the other 2 dvds in the 4 dvd set are NOT worth your time or money. The 2 I mentioned however, are very good, and buying them separately saves you $18 from if you bought the 4 disc set. Trust me, there is a HUGE quality difference in the 4 dvds included. Do not waste your money on the set.Here is my review just for the Total Body Fat Burner dvd:I got this dvd as part of a 4 dvd set of Tracey Mallett's QuickBlast Method workouts. I tried the Rock Hard Abs & Buns and the Dancer's Body dvds before this one (both also part of the set) and was very disappointed in those two, and therefore not too hopeful when trying this. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This is leagues above the others and a solid workout.The dvd is obviously aimed at those who have limited time in their day and particularly mothers. It's made up of a series of 6 minute segments and everyone demonstrating the workout with Tracey on the dvd is a woman who supposedly lost weight from Tracey's method (and all but one or two are mothers who wanted to lose baby weight and are very busy). They are all in average shape, versus most workouts where they are all in excellent shape. This is probably a positive for some people and a negative for others. As for me, it was somewhat discouraging seeing people in worse shape than me doing the exercises, knowing they've been on the program for 6 weeks. However, none of them are in bad shape and some of them had lost a significant amount from the program (I believe the highest was around 80 pounds).Tracey recommends doing 3 or so segments a day, fitting them in whenever you can (e.g. 6 min. in a.m., 6 in afternoon, 6 in evening). I like doing the entire dvd in one sitting, which ends up being about an hour. The dvd offers a couple of recommended weekly combinations (programmed in as selections you can play) with 3 or 4 different segments for each day of the week. You can also choose to play a 6 min. segment individually. You can not customize a selection of several segments to play in a row.The 10 segments are as follows: Warm-up, 3 Lower Body/Cardio segments, 4 Upper Body segments, Ab Blast, and Cool down/stretches. The upper body and ab segments all use a stability ball and the upper body segments also use 2 sets of weights (3 and 5 lb or 5 and 8 lb recommended).The warm-up is essentially variations on walking. Very basic and didn't do much to really warm me up. I was hesitant at this point in terms of how much I would like the workout. (And if she said ""sexy"" one more time during the warm-up I probably would have turned it off). Thankfully it got much better.The lower body and upper body segments are each made up of 2 minute circuits that are repeated 3 times each to make up the 6 minutes. Each circuit has 3 or 4 moves. I found this 2 min. circuit approach to be effective but just a bit boring. Granted, you're only going for 6 minutes at a time (not long enough to squeeze in too much variation OR for it to get too boring), but it's not exactly exciting to repeat each set 3x. There is a countdown clock on the bottom of the screen, which I liked. Each segment works different areas of the lower and upper body which is important to me since I normally do the entire dvd in one workout and wouldn't want to be working one muscle group repeatedly in all of the different segments. For me, each of the main segments was a good intensity level. They were not too easy, but not challenging to the point where I got discouraged or felt like I had to stop. I felt the burn in each muscle group and the lower body segments offered a decent cardio workout as well (the first two more than the third).The abs section on the ball isn't terribly difficult though it's a nice change from the standard mat work ab exercises. A couple of the moves challenged my balance a bit, but all were doable. This segment is also about 6 minutes but is not done in the 2 minute circuit format. It is a series of different ab exercises that are done once and then not repeated again.The cool down segment is 4 minutes and offers some basic stretches, nothing I haven't seen before. It's fairly standard.Tracey's personality will appeal to certain people, and less so to others. She's very encouraging, versus demanding/pushing, and quite peppy and cheery. This is a good workout dvd for ALL levels (though I'd say it's most aimed at advanced beginners), especially those who like shorter segment workouts or new mothers who need a bit of encouragement.",4,Good overall workout for the time crunched,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,4973,"['UPDATE', 'reason', 'Amazon', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'review', 'set', 'separately', 'individual',
