820700,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B00020X87U,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","Here's a film that's reminsicent of the old ABC-TV seriesLOVE AMERICAN STYLE. It even has a similar cast of famous faces.LOVERS AND OTHER STRANGERS ran on Broadway for two months in the autumn of 1968. Written by Ren&eacute;e Taylor and Joseph Bologna and directed by Charles Grodin, this generally melancholy stageplay concerns an imminent wedding that causes crisis in the lives of several couples. Richard S. Castellano is the only original cast member to appear in the movie version. (Also in the play: Gerald S. O'Laughlin, Dick Van Patten and Ron Carey.)SYNOPSIS--Beatrice (Bea Arthur) and Frank Vecchio (Castellano) have been married half their lives, but never happily, for she knows that he's been unfaithful in the past. For what the Vecchios consider a trivial reason, oldest son Ritchie (Joseph Hindy) and wife Joan (Diane Keaton) want to end a 6 year union. Mom and Dad try their best to talk both of them out of it. Their youngest boy Mike (Michael Brandon) has upcoming nuptials with Susan Henderson (Bonnie Bedelia), yet he'd rather continue living together just as they've been secretly doing all along.Susan's parents (Gig Young and Cloris Leachman) also have a rocky marriage due to Hal's cheating with Bernice's best friend, Kathy (Anne Jackson), who's utterly miserable because Hal never keeps his promise to divorce Bernice.Susan's sister, Wilma (Anne Meara) is love-starved because husband Johnny (Harry Guardino) would rather ride his exercise bike and watch old movies likeSPELLBOUNDon TV. Wilma's frequent carping about sex may soon bring them to divorce court.A blind date is arranged by Mike (the groom, remember?) for his friend Jerry (Bob Dishy) and bridesmaid Brenda (Marian Hailey), who is Susan's cousin. Brenda has never been with a man and her evening with Jerry is in part spent moving from room to room until she's somewhat reassured that climbing into bed is the right thing to do. They and the other couples have heart-to-heart talks, and that's the focus of this story: communication about dissatisfaction.Of all the above actors, Castellano is most surprising. Unlike ""fat Clemenza"" inTHE GODFATHER, here he plays a thoughtful man and this comes through in Castellano's expressions and remarkably soulful eyes. Bea Arthur brings her typical hard edge to Mrs. Vecchio. Sadly, Gig Young's difficult life of physical and emotional problems are deeply etched in his face. Anthony Holland's fey wedding planner should be amusing but isn't. Diane Keaton's makeup is very unflattering. Anne Jackson succeeds in the toughest role of all, sustaining believable crying jags. Her final scene is deeply touching.""Lovers and Other Strangers"" is a dated and minor picture, but worth watching for the varied performances of its talented ensemble.",4,"Frank Vecchio: ""We're all strangers. But after a while you get used to it. You become deeper strangers.

I found the dialogue kind of scripted-sounding..  but not long after that as different characters emerge and the topic of marriage gets underway from many different angles I started to find it quite interesting (and also less 'scripty' sounding).  Yes, the movie has funny moments though I'm not sure I'd call it a 'comedy'.  With a light tone it attempts some treatise on what marriage is for different people: those who've been married a long time (the parents), those getting married (the unsure groom and bride), the wolfish bachelor, and the brother and his wife who are planning divorce.  It doesn't paint a hugely inspiring picture of marriage - if you're not married it may help you appreciate your own situation more.  The other reason I liked it is because, being made in the year 1970, it does have a strong vibe of the time, which you'll recognize if you're familiar with a other films of the era (e.g &#34;Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice&#34;, etc).

820712,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00020X87U,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Lovers and Other Strangers is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. The acting is outstanding and the timing so fine-tuned that the comedy is almost non-stop without being corny or tasteless. The casting was brilliantly done and the movie gets high marks in my book for great cinematography and choreography, especially in the wedding scenes. The plot flows along at a very good pace without ever feeling rushed or too slow; and every scene only made me even more interested in finding out what would happen next and how--or if--certain interpersonal problems amongst the characters would be resolved.Actually, the movie has more than one plot, although most if not all of the subplots revolve around the wedding of the somewhat nervous Mike Vecchio (Michael Brandon) to his very pretty and self-confident girlfriend Susan (Bonnie Bedelia). Mike isn't always so sure he wants to marry Susan; he prefers that they continue to live together. Of course, they are living together unbeknownst to the family elders, some of whom would have had a stroke if they knew Mike and Susan were living together before the wedding.The subplots are very entertaining and as they flesh out the movie they also show how complicated relationships really are and how deep feelings can alter the stability of a relationship; but of course this is all done with comedy to make everything light and enjoyable at once. There's Mike's brother Ritchie (Joseph Hindy) who is estranged from his wife Joan (Diane Keaton); they're on the verge of divorce while Mike and Ritchie's parents, Bea (Bea Arthur) and Frank (Richard S. Castellano) desperately try to convince Ritchie and Joan to remain together. There's also Mike's buddy Jerry (Bob Dishy) who loves ""to score"" with the ladies and there are plenty of laughs when Jerry tries to get Susan's friend Brenda (Marian Hailey) into bed with him. Even more complications ensure when Susan's father Hal (Gig Young) is romancing another woman (Anne Jackson as Kathy) in bathrooms (yes, bathrooms) throughout the film; and of course Hal's wife Bernice (Cloris Leachman) has no idea her husband is cheating on her.We also see some of the characters going to confession; and there are great cameos by Conrad Bain as a priest and Jerry Stiller as a guest and the father of a flower girl at Mike and Susan's wedding.Of course, from here the action can go in numerous directions and I'm not about to give out spoilers! You'll enjoy it; I'm sure.Lovers and Other Strangers is a perfect example of a classic comedy that, at least in my opinion, is every bit as funny now as it was when it was first released back in 1970.

It is one of those movies that is known as a ""sleeper"".The movie focusses on a young couple near the eve of their wedding.  The inter-related stories involve their friends and family and focusses on their relationships.  A brother is getting a divorce, a best man is on the make, an aunt and uncle are discerning their own sexuality, a father-in-law is manipulating his love affair, etc. etc..  There is a lot of humor in these sidebars and there is a lot of truth in them as well.  Indeed, the whole movie is a somewhat dated look at relationships in general with some touching discoveries along with some embarassingly ""on the mark"" looks at ourselves.Because of the varied stories intermixing with one another, the  movie moves along well and it culminates in a meaningful way.  We see hope for one damaged relationship while we see another avoid getting off on the wrong foot.  We see plenty more in the overall process and we leave with a good feeling.  Our lives may not be changed by ""Lovers and Other Strangers"" but we are probably more apt to turn off the TV, buy that present, remember that birthday, and monitor our own relationships a bit better.""Lovers and Other Strangers"" was nominated for a couple of major Oscars including a Best Supporting Actor nomination for the good acting of Richard Castellano.  The award it won was for Best Song (""For All We Know"").  Usually, when the only Oscar a movie wins is for Best Song, it's an indication to buy the CD and not the DVD.  In the case of ""Lovers and Other Strangers"" it's the movie that's worth buying.",3,A Fun Movie,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,2287,"['used', 'watch', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'so', 'religiously', 'names', 'nomineees', 'as', 'well', 'winners', 'stayed', 'years', 'immediately', 'recognized', 'Lovers', 'Other', 'Strangers', 'nominee', 'winner', 'years', 'ago', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'available', 'TV', 'so', 'naturally', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'opportunity', 'am', 'glad', 'watched', 'fun', 'movie', 'lines', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'Love', 'American', 'Style', 'mean', 'compilation', 'stories', 'story', 'love', 'sex', 'humor', 'main', 'ingredients', 'Lovers', 'Other', 'Strangers', 'clearly', 'quality', 'aforementioned', 'TV', 'show', 'not', 'blessed', 'overall', 'quality', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'one', 'movies', 'known', 'sleeper', '.The', 'movie', 'focusses', 'young', 'couple', 'eve', 'wedding', 'inter-related', 'stories', 'involve', 'friends', 'family', 'focusses', 'relationships', 'brother', 'getting', 'divorce', 'best', 'man', 'make', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'are', 'discerning', 'own', 'sexuality', 'father-in-law', 'manipulating', 'love', 'affair', 'etc', 'etc..', 'lot', 'humor', 'sidebars', 'lot', 'truth', 'as', 'well', 'Indeed', 'whole', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'look', 'relationships', 'general', 'touching', 'discoveries', 'embarassingly', 'mark', 'ourselves.Because', 'varied', 'stories', 'intermixing', 'one', 'movie', 'along', 'well', 'meaningful', 'way', 'see', 'hope', 'one', 'damaged', 'relationship', 'see', 'avoid', 'getting', 'off', 'wrong', 'foot', 'see', 'plenty', 'more', 'overall', 'process', 'leave', 'good', 'feeling', 'lives', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'changed', 'Lovers', 'Other', 'Strangers', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'apt', 'turn', 'off', 'TV', 'buy', 'present', 'remember', 'birthday', 'monitor', 'own', 'relationships', 'bit', 'better', 'Lovers', 'Other', 'Strangers', 'was', 'nominated', 'couple', 'major', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'good', 'acting', 'Richard', 'Castellano', 'award', 'won', 'was', 'Best', 'Song', 'Know', 'Usually', 'when', 'only', 'movie', 'Best', 'Song', 'indication', 'buy', 'CD', 'not', 'DVD', 'case', 'Lovers', 'Other', 'Strangers', 'movie', 'worth', 'buying']",N/A

After all he has been living with his intended for the past year.  Unbeknownst to all, his lady's cool dad has been cheating on her mom for years.  Her sister, seemingly happily married with two growing boys, has one quarrel after another with her husband.Yet with all the hypocrisy of the '70's brought to light, the lovers tie the knot, and heaven help them, we hope they will do better than all the others!  The roles are played beautifully with Gig Young as her father, a standout.  Her mother, Chloris Leachman, and his parents, Bea Arthur and Richard Castellanos are also just fine.  Direction is terrific too.A subplot involves a couple of young people who are on a date at the wedding.
