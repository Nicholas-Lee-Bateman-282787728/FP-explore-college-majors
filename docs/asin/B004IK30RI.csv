Whoever thought of that idea had a great one in my book.This movie is not simply a movie for kids. No. Some of the jokes are...as the first disc of the set say, racy humor. Many of them will go over the kids heads watching but still...watch it with them the first time.",5,"For the price, it is more than worth it.",1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,454,"['Brady', 'Bunch', 'movies', 'came', 'out', '90', 'were', 'interesting', 'me.The', 'first', 'set', 'up', 'concept', 'Brady', 'family', 'being', 'stuck', 'time', 'warp', 'still', 'trying', 'be', 'Whoever', 'thought', 'idea', 'had', 'great', 'one', 'book.This', 'movie', 'not', 'simply', 'movie', 'kids', 'jokes', 'are', 'first', 'disc', 'set', 'say', 'racy', 'humor', 'Many', 'will', 'go', 'kids', 'heads', 'watching', 'still', 'watch', 'first', 'time']",A Brady Bunch of Movies: (The Brady Bunch Movie / A Very Brady Sequel / Brady Bunch In The White House / Growing Up Brady)

1411160,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B004IK30RI,JGC,"[9, 9]","This is a super cool 4-disc set of 4 of the grooviest movies ever made. Each disc includes a color silkscreen picture on it. No special features are included though and these are the exact same discs that come with the standalone releases. Discs are packaged in a lenticular slipcase (see pictures of everything I scanned, labled and posted).Below are the 4 movies/4 discs included:The Brady Bunch Movie (1995) feature filmrated: PG-13, 88 mins., widescreen formatA Very Brady Sequel (1996) feature filmrated: PG-13, 89 mins., widescreen formatThe Brady Bunch in the White House (2002) TV movierated: PG-13, 88 mins., fullscreen formatGrowing Up Brady (2000) TV movierated: PG-13, 88 mins., fullscreen formatMy favorite movie from this set is ""The Brady Bunch Movie"" and coming in at a close second is ""A Very Brady Sequel"". These movies are very sharp and pure satire, no BB fan can watch them without laughing at the ludicrousness. The other 2 movies aren't as strong as the proceeding ones, but they're still excellent and at this price I can't really complain.Like the BB Shag Carpet boxed set, this is also made in Mexico and distributed by Paramount. (Note to Paramount: please consider putting out the complete series of ""The Brady Brides"", as well as the 1990 ""The Bradys"" as I'm sure you know many fans would desperately like to watch these hilarious shows again.)If you have any interest in ""The Brady Bunch"" I say get this set because chances are it will become a collector's item (not at all unlike the 1-disc ""Brady Bunch Variety Hour"" DVD). This is just so much fun to watch and something you can be proud to share with your friends because who doesn't love the Bradys.Mr. Sherwood Schwartz (may he rest in peace) created ""The Brady Bunch"" more than 40 years ago. And since then an entire world inspired by this classic has been reinvented countless times over the decades. As a lifelong BB fan, to me, what makes ""The Brady Bunch"" so lasting is that it's more than just a sitcom; it's a family that transcends time and culture. We can relate to them because we grew up watching them.",5,"don't fight the tide, come along for the ride",1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,2098,"['super', 'cool', '4-disc', 'set', '4', 'grooviest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'disc', 'color', 'silkscreen', 'picture', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'exact', 'same', 'discs', 'standalone', 'Discs', 'are', 'packaged', 'lenticular', 'slipcase', 'see', 'pictures', 'everything', 'scanned', 'labled', 'posted', '.Below', 'are', '4', 'movies/4', 'discs', 'included', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Movie', '1995', 'feature', 'filmrated', 'PG-13', '88', 'mins.', 'widescreen', 'formatA', 'Very', 'Brady', 'Sequel', '1996', 'feature', 'filmrated', 'PG-13', '89', 'mins.', 'widescreen', 'formatThe', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'White', 'House', '2002', 'TV', 'movierated', 'PG-13', '88', 'mins.', 'fullscreen', 'formatGrowing', 'Up', 'Brady', '2000', 'TV', 'movierated', 'PG-13', '88', 'mins.', 'fullscreen', 'formatMy', 'favorite', 'movie', 'set', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Movie', 'coming', 'close', 'second', 'Very', 'Brady', 'Sequel', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'sharp', 'pure', 'satire', 'BB', 'fan', 'can', 'watch', 'laughing', 'ludicrousness', 'other', '2', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'proceeding', 'ones', ""'re"", 'still', 'excellent', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'complain.Like', 'BB', 'Shag', 'Carpet', 'boxed', 'set', 'also', 'made', 'Mexico', 'distributed', 'Paramount', 'Note', 'Paramount', 'please', 'consider', 'putting', 'out', 'complete', 'series', 'Brady', 'Brides', 'as', 'well', '1990', 'Bradys', ""'m"", 'sure', 'know', 'many', 'fans', 'would', 'desperately', 'watch', 'hilarious', 'shows', 'again', 'have', 'interest', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'say', 'get', 'set', 'chances', 'are', 'will', 'become', 'collector', 'item', 'not', '1-disc', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'Variety', 'Hour', 'DVD', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'share', 'friends', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'Bradys.Mr', 'Sherwood', 'Schwartz', 'may', 'rest', 'peace', 'created', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'more', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'entire', 'world', 'inspired', 'classic', 'been', 'reinvented', 'countless', 'times', 'decades', 'lifelong', 'BB', 'fan', 'what', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'lasting', 'more', 'just', 'sitcom', 'family', 'time', 'culture', 'can', 'relate', 'grew', 'up', 'watching']",A Brady Bunch of Movies: (The Brady Bunch Movie / A Very Brady Sequel / Brady Bunch In The White House / Growing Up Brady)

Unfortunately, it's out of print, so if you can snag a copy like I did on Amazon's Marketplace, you're in for a real treat. The first two Brady movies are wonderfully satirical and sharp. To me, they are the Brady Bunch for Adults, whereas the original TV series is great for kids. I also caught ""Growing Up Brady"" on TV, so I'm pleased to get this on DVD. It is a made-for-TV movie that is based on Barry Williams' book of the same name. You get to see the back story told from Barry's point of view, about the show and its cast members. I have to admit being disappointed that the original group of kids from the movies weren't used for ""Brady Bunch In the White House""; even Alice was cast with a different actress. It's a cute movie, but I still prefer the first two Brady films. Overall, a nice set of Brady films that will keep you entertained for hours.",5,"Bradys, Bradys, Bradys!

1411163,A31TVT9DSU5HL1,B004IK30RI,Paul Jutras,"[0, 0]",Its a shame the real Brady Bunch movies like The Brady Girls Gets Married didn't come out like this instead of in the TV series complete box set. (even if Brady Girls not included in that set.)  I'm sorry but they should call this a goofy films rather than a groovy films.  While goofy worked for stuff like Get Smart  it doesn't work with most of the 1960s and 1970s sitcoms that Hollywood been making in movies like these. I would much prefer it if the actors took their Brady character roles seriously rather than being made cheesy on purpose. The first one was bad enough but each of these movies like the Brady Sequel spoof on the show Hawaii trip just got worst with each one made.,1,give me the original movies,1393113600,"02 23, 2014",2014,687,"['shame', 'real', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'movies', 'Brady', 'Girls', 'Gets', 'Married', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'instead', 'TV', 'series', 'complete', 'box', 'set', 'even', 'Brady', 'Girls', 'not', 'included', 'set', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'should', 'call', 'goofy', 'films', 'rather', 'groovy', 'films', 'goofy', 'worked', 'stuff', 'Get', 'Smart', ""n't"", 'work', 'most', '1960s', '1970s', 'sitcoms', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'making', 'movies', 'would', 'much', 'prefer', 'actors', 'took', 'Brady', 'character', 'seriously', 'rather', 'being', 'made', 'cheesy', 'purpose', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'movies', 'Brady', 'Sequel', 'spoof', 'show', 'Hawaii', 'trip', 'just', 'got', 'worst', 'one', 'made']",A Brady Bunch of Movies: (The Brady Bunch Movie / A Very Brady Sequel / Brady Bunch In The White House / Growing Up Brady)
