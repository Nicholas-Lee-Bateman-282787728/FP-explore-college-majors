This collection deals with ""Q"", the first villian (sort of) that TNG dealt with.The only detail you need to know about the Q is that they are all-powerful god-like beings but they are in many ways immature.  The episodes here are all of Q's appearances on three different shows.The first 2 episodes come from TNG's first season, and quite frankly the cast did not gel yet.  Some of the acting is bad.  There are also several things we learn about the Q that would change over the course of the series.  As TNG took off, the performances became more solid.

In each of his episodes, he presents the crew of the Enterprise with a new moral dilemma, making not only for some of the most entertaining shows, but also the most thought provoking. John de Lancie plays the part superbly and combines an arrogance with a certain humor and ruefulness that bring a great sense of comedic relief to Star Trek. It's great to finally have all of the episodes on one disc.My favorite Q scene: In TNG's ""Tapestry,"" Picard is in bed (hairy chest and all) after what is presumably a night with an attractive young female. A hand from offscreen gently reaches to touch his hair. As Picard turns to look at his partner, the camera pans right to reveal Q in a Starfleet uniform beside Picard, smiling ruefully.

Q was the character that allowed the writers the most room for real creativity, in my opinion. Q visitations usually gave rise to the best dialogue and situational humor, which may not have been the primary thing trekkies were looking for in Trek, but loads of fun, nonetheless. This dvd collection is full of the best the franchise has to offer in that arena.John DeLancie, who plays Q, is the best, most subtle actor ever to show his face on the bridge of the Enterprise, and it's just pure fun to watch him portray the unpredictable, unquantifiable Q.The Q episodes, in perhaps more purely Trek fashion, also offered the opportunity to explore some thought-provoking questions about the meaning of being human, civilized, and evolved. Of course, this was a t.v. series, so the writing mostly sort of waded in the shallow end of some very deep pools.

So imagine my surprise when I found myself really enjoying this collection--it probably helped that I hadn't seen the Next Gen eps since they aired and the others not at all.  The character of Q brought something to the next gen Star Treks that they lacked all too often--humor, unattractive character traits, selfishness:  a humanity that other characters lacked sometimes, even though I loved TNG.  Yet thanks to Q, we see a grumpy Worf, a grumpy Geordi, etc.  Q's interactions with the regular cast is fun to watch--though we needed more Q and less Vash in Q-less (though I did like the character of Vash a lot).  Seeing Suzy Plakson again is great, too, in the Q and the Grey, even if it's not a strong episode.  Seeing Q interact with each of the three captains is fun, and the character arc for Q is interesting.  John de Lancie does a really excellent job and he ""gets"" Star Trek as well as anyone.Encounter at Farpoint and Hide and Q are a bit painful to watch--the cast was overacting so badly that it's a wonder that the show survived the first season--they are interesting for that reason alone. Q was the best thing in both episdoes.  Q-Who is chilling and wonderful, and the Borg were at their best--they lost a bit of their menace with each subsequent appearance.  Deja Q was very, very funny--better than I remembered.  The Q-Geordi and Q-Data interaction is great.  Q-pid is nearly as funny. True  Q is a bit dull, but Tapestry is one of the best ever TNG episodes.  All Good Things is fun if you ignore the plot holes that you can drive a truck through.  As the commentary points out, Q-less, as one of the first DS9 eps, gives a wonderful look at the foundation of the DS-9 characters and watching Q interact with Sisko is great.  I liked the fact that they show the episodes in Q-order with this episode before TNG finale.

You avoid two of the pitfalls found in the alternative of purchasing all individual seasons: firstly, even at a reduced price, you will end up spending considerably more on individual seasons; secondly, having a bookshelf devoted to startrek is not always socially the wisest course of action. For those who make the leap and fully indulge in their passion for Trek, I make no judgments. Personally, I would like to enjoy my sci-fi fix with a little bit more subtlety than a 28 season marathon in my room and few more dollars in my pocket.The episodes chosen seem to capture the theme of each boxed set very well, and it would be nice to see a ""Startrek: Classics"" set with no particular theme, just those good episodes that were fun to watch. I like the 'Time Travel' Collection more than the 'Q' and `Borg' collections because the episodes seem to have a little more variety within that theme. The Next Generation episodes present a much broader spectrum of 'Q' and 'time travel' than than the 'Borg' collection manages.Generally speaking, if I were going to purchase only one of these Fan Collectives, 'Q' would not be it (time travel is the best in my opinion); however, because I am a star trek geek, I bought more than one set, and I am enjoying re-viewing the shows I watched when I was younger.  The 'Q' collection is pretty much self explanitory- every episode deals with the omnipotent being we all love to hate.  So if thats what you want to watch, then this is the collection for you.  If not, then don't buy it.  Don't expect much new, if you've already spent a thousand dollars on all the complete seasons.I will fault the selections for the overlap that is present in each theme.

In this collection of Q-related episodes from TNG, DSN, and Voyager, again there's a bit of hit and miss.

He appears during the first episode in The Next Generation series, and puts humanity on trial for being a savage, barbaric race.

And how did that one scene go?  ""I'll have 10 hot fudge sundaes... I'm in a really bad mood.""In Tapestry, Picard is killed.  Is Q God?  Q gives Picard a chance to relive a period from his past, and Picard, for the first time, sincerely thanks Q for his help.

One of the drawbacks of his character is that many of his scenes actually depend on his annoying behavior, and that doesn't stand up as well as more straight drama or comedy. I prefer the more developed Q, once they got past the first few episodes, and before he was more of a wimpy whiner with Janeway. Begging Janeway to have his child? Please.The Farpoint show could have been much better. Too bad they didn't do it a few years in. Q's scenes could have been more refined, for example, as his touch of evil at that time was more compelling than the drift toward comedy.""All Good Things"" is one of the best, if you do the usual blocking out of the huge holes in time travel stories and the illogic in the core threat of the thing that ate the galaxy. Picard and Q had such a natural relationship, with Stewart and De Lancie each effective.""Death Wish"" has always been an excellent concept, perhaps underappreciated. What would you do if you were immortal and omnipotent? Hmm. Really takes ""been there, done that"" to a new level.""Tapestry"" has Picard as George Bailey and Q as Clarence. Yes, it's a bit of a stretch to conclude that, but Q gives Picard a look at what might have been.

Looking at those episodes, they just don't have the impact the other collections have, so I am shocked it is due to come out - long before Q.  (Not that the episode assortment is bad, but only TOS got the time travel aspect right in my opinion, and Q is a heckuvalot more imaginative anyway.)But back to Q.  As of this writing I am speculating that all the Q stories will be released:Encounter at FarpointHide and QQ-Who?  (also in the Borg collection)Deja QQ-PidTrue QTapestryAll Good Things... (also in the Time Travel collection)and his various offerings in DS9 and in Voyager too; though if we're all limited to 10 stories, they can nix the DS9 and the worsr Voyager one.  :)I've also noticed some slight duplications in stories.  ""All Good Things"" being both a Q piece and a time travel one.  And Q-Who being a bit Borgy as well. While the cynic in me would normally disagree, I am not against it this time because some stories do overlap categories, we are not forced to buy extra sets we otherwise don't want (unlike the season released if we only wanted the cliffhanger of a story resolved!), and in those sets it's there so we don't have to swap discs if we want to see that other episode.Of course, Endgame is a bit of a surprise on the time travel set...  ""Relics"" would have been more apropos.  Scotty travels 80 years into the future...  and maybe because they are mixing themes, they could have allowed this.  Meh, oh well.I am quite happy with these releases coming out.  I wish Q's was sooner...And I suspect a Data one will be out later this year.

977908,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000ERVJJ0,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[110, 114]","Misunderstood or just a god with a nasty sense of humor either way Q (the marvelous John de Lancie)was one of the highlights of ""The Next Generation"" and was such a good character that he was seamlessly incorporated into two other series. If this follows the course set with the other releases, we'll see probably 12 episodes. Here's the episode listing for each Q appearence as well the series it was drawn from.The best of Q, however, truly is in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". In ""Encounter at Farpoint Parts 1 & 2"" Q puts humanity on trial for its arrogance and destructiveness. The Enterprise crew has one chance to redeem themselves--they must figure out a mystery involving ""Farpoint"" a station for the Federation that comes under attack by a mysterious alien race. The pilot also features a cameo by the late DeForest Kelley as Admiral McCoy in an amusing scene with Data.The first season of ""The Next Generation"" was wildly uneven with some truly bad episodes alternating with some extremely good ones. ""Hide & Q"" straddles the line between these two extremes. While not the best it does offer de Lancie the chance to chew some scenery. Called in to help a mining colory, Q sets a test for Riker--he gives him the power of the Q and tempts him to use it to save his crewmates. In ""Q Who"" an enraged Q flings the Enterprise across the galaxy to test the crew against a new race they've never dealt with before--the Borg.The third season featured two Q for the price of one. In ""Deja Q"" Q has been stripped of his power and made into a mortal. Q must prove his worth both to the Enterprise and to his the other Q (including Corbin Bernsen in a cameo as another member of the Q). This episode includes a text commentary.""Q-Pid"" brings together the Enterprise crew and Q in a reenactment of Robin Hood with Captain Picard as Robin Hood and Q as the Sheriff of Notthingham. ""True Q"" is a so-so episode in which an honor student on the Enterprise realizes she's a member of the Q Continuum. Q comes to claim her but she is torn between her humanity and going to the Q Continuum. When Picard is killed in a terrorist attack in ""Tapestry""he finds himself in limbo with Q claiming to be God. Q feels bad for Picard and allows him to revisit a moment in his past. It was evidently inspired by a pitch for an episode called ""A Q Carol"" a variation on ""A Christmas Carol"".Finally we get the conclusion episode of the series ""All Good Things Parts 1 & 2"" in which Picard discovers that the universe is about to end and its all his fault. Picard whisks back and forth in time with Q providing him clues as to why he's responsible for the end of humanity but refusing to provide him with the solution.The ""DS9"" episode ""Q-Less"" is the only episode from the series featuring Q and it's quite a good one with a highlight being a boxing match between Commander Sisko and Q in which Sisko knocks Q out (""Picard never hit me!""). Finally from ""Voyager"" we get ""Deathwish"" in which a member of the Q Continuum wants to die and Captain Janeway is chosen as the judge in the case while Q presents the arguement against allowing a member of his race to die. This episode includes another text commentary. This episode actually appears on disc two as it takes place before ""Tapestry"".""The Q & The Grey"" the Q are in the middle of a civil war and Q transports the Voyager crew to his continuum chosing to make it appear symbolically as America during its own Civil war. In his final appearence as Q de Lancie appears to the Voyager crew and dumps his adolescent son Q2 (also the title of the episode(Keegan de Lancie)on the Voyager crew to deal with. Evidently the boy is bringing chaos to the Q continuum and the Continuum has indicated that Q must straighten the boy out. Q believes that Starfleet ideals might serve the youth and do the job.As someone else pointed out this set would have worked well with the inclusion of ""The Squire of Gothos"" since the character of Trelane was an inspiration for the character of Q in ""The Next Generation"". Unfortunately it's not included with the set. I'm not sure if it wasn't presented as an option for this set or if it was just overlooked. It's a pity as it would have fit in quite well with this set.Are these sets worthwhile for fans who own the entire run of ""TNG"", ""Voyager"" and ""DS9""? Probably not but if you have a couple of seasons of one series or don't have all the Trek incarnations this is a pretty good set to have. Paramount has added three text commentary tracks to this set which is a nice plus since there weren't any on the original ""Next Gen"" or ""DS9"" sets.",4,Excellent collection focusing on one of Trek's best bad guys--complete episode line up!,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,4606,"['Misunderstood', 'just', 'god', 'nasty', 'sense', 'humor', 'way', 'Q', 'marvelous', 'John', 'de', 'Lancie', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'Next', 'Generation', 'was', 'such', 'good', 'character', 'was', 'seamlessly', 'incorporated', 'two', 'other', 'series', 'course', 'set', 'other', 'releases', ""'ll"", 'see', 'probably', '12', 'episodes', 'Here', 'episode', 'listing', 'Q', 'appearence', 'as', 'well', 'series', 'was', 'drawn', 'from.The', 'best', 'Q', 'however', 'truly', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Encounter', 'Farpoint', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'Q', 'humanity', 'trial', 'arrogance', 'destructiveness', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'one', 'chance', 'redeem', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'mystery', 'involving', 'Farpoint', 'station', 'Federation', 'attack', 'mysterious', 'alien', 'race', 'pilot', 'also', 'cameo', 'late', 'DeForest', 'Kelley', 'Admiral', 'McCoy', 'amusing', 'scene', 'Data.The', 'first', 'season', 'Next', 'Generation', 'was', 'wildly', 'uneven', 'truly', 'bad', 'episodes', 'alternating', 'extremely', 'good', 'ones', 'Hide', 'Q', 'line', 'two', 'extremes', 'not', 'best', 'offer', 'Lancie', 'chance', 'chew', 'scenery', 'Called', 'help', 'mining', 'colory', 'Q', 'test', 'Riker', 'power', 'Q', 'use', 'save', 'crewmates', 'Q', 'Who', 'enraged', 'Q', 'Enterprise', 'galaxy', 'test', 'crew', 'new', 'race', ""'ve"", 'never', 'dealt', 'before', 'Borg.The', 'third', 'season', 'featured', 'two', 'Q', 'price', 'one', 'Deja', 'Q', 'Q', 'been', 'stripped', 'power', 'made', 'mortal', 'Q', 'must', 'prove', 'worth', 'Enterprise', 'other', 'Q', 'including', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'cameo', 'member', 'Q', 'episode', 'text', 'commentary', 'Q-Pid', 'together', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'Q', 'reenactment', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Captain', 'Picard', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Q', 'Sheriff', 'Notthingham', 'True', 'Q', 'so-so', 'episode', 'honor', 'student', 'Enterprise', 'member', 'Q', 'Continuum', 'Q', 'claim', 'torn', 'humanity', 'going', 'Q', 'Continuum', 'When', 'Picard', 'killed', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'Tapestry', 'limbo', 'Q', 'claiming', 'be', 'God', 'Q', 'bad', 'Picard', 'revisit', 'moment', 'past', 'was', 'evidently', 'inspired', 'pitch', 'episode', 'called', 'A', 'Q', 'Carol', 'variation', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', '.Finally', 'get', 'conclusion', 'episode', 'series', 'Good', 'Things', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'Picard', 'universe', 'end', 'fault', 'Picard', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'Q', 'providing', 'clues', 'why', 'responsible', 'end', 'humanity', 'refusing', 'provide', 'solution.The', 'DS9', 'episode', 'Q-Less', 'only', 'episode', 'series', 'featuring', 'Q', 'quite', 'good', 'one', 'highlight', 'being', 'boxing', 'match', 'Commander', 'Sisko', 'Q', 'Sisko', 'Q', 'out', 'Picard', 'never', 'hit', 'Finally', 'Voyager', 'get', 'Deathwish', 'member', 'Q', 'Continuum', 'die', 'Captain', 'Janeway', 'chosen', 'judge', 'case', 'Q', 'arguement', 'allowing', 'member', 'race', 'die', 'episode', 'text', 'commentary', 'episode', 'actually', 'disc', 'two', 'place', 'Tapestry', 'Q', 'Grey', 'Q', 'are', 'middle', 'civil', 'war', 'Q', 'Voyager', 'crew', 'continuum', 'chosing', 'make', 'appear', 'symbolically', 'America', 'own', 'Civil', 'war', 'final', 'appearence', 'Q', 'Lancie', 'Voyager', 'crew', 'dumps', 'adolescent', 'son', 'Q2', 'also', 'title', 'episode', 'Keegan', 'de', 'Lancie', 'Voyager', 'crew', 'deal', 'Evidently', 'boy', 'bringing', 'chaos', 'Q', 'continuum', 'Continuum', 'indicated', 'Q', 'must', 'straighten', 'boy', 'out', 'Q', 'Starfleet', 'ideals', 'might', 'serve', 'youth', 'do', 'job.As', 'someone', 'else', 'pointed', 'out', 'set', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'well', 'inclusion', 'Squire', 'Gothos', 'character', 'Trelane', 'was', 'inspiration', 'character', 'Q', 'Next', 'Generation', 'not', 'included', 'set', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', ""n't"", 'presented', 'option', 'set', 'was', 'just', 'overlooked', 'pity', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'quite', 'well', 'set.Are', 'sets', 'worthwhile', 'fans', 'who', 'own', 'entire', 'run', 'TNG', 'Voyager', 'DS9', 'Probably', 'not', 'have', 'couple', 'seasons', 'one', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Trek', 'incarnations', 'pretty', 'good', 'set', 'have', 'Paramount', 'added', 'three', 'text', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'set', 'nice', 'were', ""n't"", 'original', 'Next', 'Gen', 'DS9', 'sets']",Star Trek Fan Collective - Q
