""nobody777""","[12, 14]","The initial reviews I read about this movie when it came out were not very positive and so I wasn't planning on seeing it in the theater.  A good friend of mine invited me to go along with him and his family and kids and so I decided it would be fun to go just to hang out with them.I was so glad I went.  I laughed sooooo hard!  Then I invited my friend Matt to go and we went and laughed our brains out some more.  I actually saw the movie again after that and it was just as funny as the first time.  I like good slapstick and &quot;stupid&quot; humor and this one just nailed me on both ends.  It had a little bit of everything in it; action, humor, romance, did I mention humor (hehehe).  I will most certainly buy the DVD when it's available and have fun watching this one over again.Not only is the movie funny, but it promotes family values and is great for kids and adults alike.  Highly recommended no matter your age range.  Good stuff!  Rare to see something really funny and entertaining from Hollywood that doesn't leave you feeling crappy after walking out of the theater.

Bad Point Number 2 is the super dog that the mob is after.  Bad Point Number 3 is the male lead...David Arquette.  Strangely though, I heard a lot of good things about it and with some trepidation fell prey to my wife's badgering and rented it this weekend.David Arquette is a lazy, shiftless, no-account mail man who accepts no responsibly in his life...and he hates dogs.  His biggest goal in life is to date the pretty woman who lives down the hall and if he has to be friends with her son, he will bend over backwards to be friends with her son.  He even agrees to watch the son, granted only for a couple of minutes while waiting for the baby-sitter so the woman can make it to the airport on time. Naturally the baby-sitter cancels entirely.Spot, or Agent 11, is the number 1 dog with the F.B.I. and the mob boss, played by Paul Sorvino, has put a hit out on Spot in retaliation for Spot's taking a bite out of...Paul.  Naturally Spot, the boy, and Arquette all end up together and found that they are a family waiting to gettogether.When the movie started, I thought my fears would be correct.  It was slow and the plot was so unbelievably retread that I was beginning to grate my teeth in agony.  Then I fell off the couch laughing.  Then I doubled over in pain because I was laughing so hard the tears began to flow.  Yes, it isone of the silliest movies I have ever heard of and the previews looked ridiculous.  However, it cracked both me and my wife up.

538372,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXVP,Matthew Horner,"[2, 6]","I try to find good things in every movie by considering all the various elements involved - script, acting, music, pacing, direction, photography, etc. Sometimes, almost nothing good exists, as in the case of See Spot Run, which is a dog of a movie. Perhaps the worst thing about it is its claim of being a family movie. I doubt there is anything especially harmful in it, but I have seen R-rated gross out comedies with less emphasis on bathroom humor bodily functions. I don't think using such material has much to do with the idea that kids are more worldly than they used to be. I think it has to do with Hollywood filmmakers who are out of touch with their audience and with Roger Ebert's assertion that society's tastes seem to have fallen to the level of the whoopee cushion.The movie's thin plot revolves around Gordon [David Arquette], a postman whom you would not want delivering your mail, and Agent 11, a dog trained by the FBI's Canine Unit. The dog is far better at his job than the postman. In fact, he's so effective that a gangster has taken out a hit on him. It seems Agent 11 has cost him $22,000,000. It has also damaged some very personal parts of his anatomy. Across town, George has fallen for his neighbor, Stephanie [Leslie Bibb], who has sensibly thwarted his advances. When she is called away on business, George gets stuck taking care of her young son, James [Angus T. Jones], after the baby-sitter doesn't show up. Meanwhile, Agent 11 makes his escape from a pair of goofy hit men, and Gordon, oblivious to the dog's dilemma, as well as to almost everything else going on around him, winds up with the clever pooch. He's stuck with a precocious kid, a dog that doesn't know how to have fun, and those inept killers. Lucky for him he's eternally clueless, I suppose.I have rarely seen a movie with so many lost opportunities. It invariably sticks with tried and true cliches that even the average eight year old is tired of. Rather than making the effort to come up with some truly funny lines and situations, Its writers fall back on stupid jokes involving passing gas and things animals naturally do to fertilize the ground. Done once or twice, such jokes can be amusing, especially if they are unexpected. Done six or seven times, they are embarrassing for the writers since they imply that these people have limited talents and are stuck in the most infantile areas of humor. There is also a running joke about the gangster that will elude children but seem plain dumb to most adults. Only once is any event seen through the dog's eyes, though I think that Agent 11's take on things could have been quite funny. Again, the writers dropped the ball.Arquette literally falls on his face here over and over trying to get laughs. He is never very funny. I've seen him do some good acting in the past, but this time all he proves is that he's no Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast does better with what little there is to work with.It doesn't bother me too much that Hollywood makes so few movies for kids these days. They are deluged with too much entertainment as it is. It does bother me that, outside of animated films, Hollywood doesn't remember how to make one.",1,The people who made this need to be on a leash,1016064000,"03 14, 2002",2002,3192,"['try', 'find', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'considering', 'various', 'elements', 'involved', 'script', 'acting', 'music', 'pacing', 'direction', 'photography', 'etc', 'Sometimes', 'almost', 'nothing', 'good', 'exists', 'case', 'See', 'Spot', 'Run', 'dog', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'worst', 'thing', 'claim', 'being', 'family', 'movie', 'doubt', 'anything', 'especially', 'harmful', 'have', 'seen', 'R-rated', 'gross', 'out', 'comedies', 'less', 'emphasis', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'bodily', 'functions', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'using', 'such', 'material', 'much', 'do', 'idea', 'kids', 'are', 'more', 'worldly', 'used', 'be', 'think', 'do', 'Hollywood', 'filmmakers', 'who', 'are', 'touch', 'audience', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'assertion', 'society', 'tastes', 'seem', 'have', 'fallen', 'level', 'whoopee', 'cushion.The', 'movie', 'thin', 'plot', 'revolves', 'Gordon', '[', 'David', 'Arquette', ']', 'postman', 'whom', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'delivering', 'mail', 'Agent', '11', 'dog', 'trained', 'FBI', 'Canine', 'Unit', 'dog', 'far', 'better', 'job', 'postman', 'fact', 'so', 'effective', 'gangster', 'taken', 'out', 'hit', 'Agent', '11', 'cost', '22,000,000', 'also', 'damaged', 'very', 'personal', 'parts', 'anatomy', 'town', 'George', 'fallen', 'neighbor', 'Stephanie', '[', 'Leslie', 'Bibb', ']', 'who', 'sensibly', 'thwarted', 'advances', 'When', 'called', 'away', 'business', 'George', 'stuck', 'taking', 'care', 'young', 'son', 'James', '[', 'Angus', 'T.', 'Jones', ']', 'baby-sitter', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'Meanwhile', 'Agent', '11', 'escape', 'pair', 'goofy', 'hit', 'men', 'Gordon', 'oblivious', 'dog', 'dilemma', 'as', 'well', 'almost', 'everything', 'else', 'going', 'up', 'clever', 'pooch', 'stuck', 'precocious', 'kid', 'dog', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'have', 'fun', 'inept', 'killers', 'Lucky', 'eternally', 'clueless', 'suppose.I', 'have', 'rarely', 'seen', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'lost', 'opportunities', 'invariably', 'tried', 'true', 'cliches', 'even', 'average', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'tired', 'Rather', 'making', 'effort', 'come', 'up', 'truly', 'funny', 'lines', 'situations', 'writers', 'fall', 'back', 'stupid', 'jokes', 'involving', 'passing', 'gas', 'things', 'animals', 'naturally', 'do', 'fertilize', 'ground', 'Done', 'once', 'twice', 'such', 'jokes', 'can', 'be', 'amusing', 'especially', 'are', 'unexpected', 'Done', 'six', 'seven', 'times', 'are', 'embarrassing', 'writers', 'imply', 'people', 'have', 'limited', 'talents', 'are', 'stuck', 'most', 'infantile', 'areas', 'humor', 'also', 'running', 'joke', 'gangster', 'will', 'elude', 'children', 'seem', 'plain', 'dumb', 'most', 'adults', 'Only', 'once', 'event', 'seen', 'dog', 'eyes', 'think', 'Agent', '11', 'take', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'funny', 'Again', 'writers', 'dropped', 'ball.Arquette', 'literally', 'face', 'here', 'trying', 'get', 'laughs', 'never', 'very', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'good', 'acting', 'past', 'time', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'rest', 'cast', 'better', 'what', 'little', 'work', 'with.It', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'few', 'movies', 'kids', 'days', 'are', 'deluged', 'too', 'much', 'entertainment', 'bother', 'animated', 'films', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'remember', 'how', 'make', 'one']",See Spot Run

This movie is just a reason to have David Arquette run around being a spastic idiot for and hour and a half. The real stumper here is why the dog is the best actor in the film. Michael Clarke Duncan, Oscar Nominee, is in this film, but why? All he does is cry about not having his dog. And he does little to show that he wants the mutt back.This movie starts out with a bang, a spoof of mafia activity, and you can tell it is all down hill from here. I have seen enough dog movies in my day to tell that this is not the type of cute, lovable animal that anyone would want back. He is a big, ugly dog that just is the center of all the torment that David Arquette can throw at him.I feel sorry for anyone in this movie, and more importantly to anyone who had to see this movie. I saw it for free, but i can still complain. It is bad. Kids will not like it, they will even think it is juvenile and unfunny.
