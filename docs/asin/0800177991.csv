Anna Chlumsky had great range for such a young actress, and it's too bad she didn't make a lot of films, but as the main character, Vada Sultenfuss you can't resist that beyond her years charm. Great supporting cast as well, who would have thought Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis could achieve unbelievable chemistry. This film deals with death so get ready to ball your eyes out, my only gripe with the dvd is it should be re-released on widescreen. I highly recommend this wonderful and tender coming of age film, also check the sequel as well.

165631,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0800177991,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 3]","I don't really get this movie.  It isn't a father/daughter film, although it is touted as one by many.  The film does have a daughter and a single father element, but they rarely share scenes and they never really create a bond worth noting.  No, this is a film about a young girl coming to terms with death and love in a strange and not so compelling way.  In fact, the film lazily concludes the film in a rush that never really gets into the heart of the premise.  It is a clich&eacute; ridden, manipulative film that has stolen the hearts of many thanks to an endearing lead performance by a young Anna Chlumsky.  She is cute and conveys her character's uniqueness rather well, but in the end it is the script that fails the film so horribly.  Yes, it is no surprise that this script failed to pass the first round of the Nicholl Fellowship screenwriting contest.  It is a hole-ridden mess really.  Yes, it makes me cry (how could it not) but it isn't a genuine heart-tug.  It never really addresses Vada's issues with any true resolve.  It had the opportunity to become something more but it was too concerned with being `light family fun' that the more intriguing aspects of the film (like the fascination and misunderstanding of death) become underdeveloped side notes.  Oh well, Chlumsky is wonderful and Culkin is also rather good.  Aykroyd and Curtis are just mere props here, doing nothing much but serving as adult stand-ins.  And, to clear up a grave (and rather foolish) mistake, Curtis does not play Culkin's single mother.  How the sites reviewer got that from this film is beyond me.

165635,A2582KMXLK2P06,0800177991,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I have several memories associated with My Girl.  The most notable one is the ""seafood/see food"" segment showing Anna Chlumksy opening her mouth during an outside dinner party and revealing a mouthful of chewed food to her father's girlfriend, haha.  Back in 1991/92 I was in 4th grade, and ALL my classmates were imitating this same exact segment by coming up to other students and asking ""Do you like seafood?""  Pretty soon the joke got worn out when it was realized nobody was falling for it anymore, so we stopped.  The other memorable scene is the bumper cars.  What seems like an innocent little game between Anna's character and her dad's new girlfriend quickly turns serious when the woman realizes Anna is focusing on bumping into only HER car.  Why?  Because Anna didn't like the fact her father was dating another woman after the death of her mom.Of course the beehive segment with Macaulay Culkin is the saddest moment in the entire movie.  It's almost hard to believe -given the pleasant tone up to this point- that a moment so sad actually occurs.  The soundtrack is incredible.  If you love the 60's and early 70's music scene, you will absolutely love the selections being played here.  Creedence Clearwater Revival, Sly & the Family Stone and of course the Temptations (yeah YOU know which song I'm referring to!) are only a small sample of the songs you'll hear.Despite Macaulay Culkin's enormous success in 1990 with Home Alone, My Girl is mainly all about Anna Chlumksy's family and friend issues (especially the relationship with her father played by Dan Aykroyd).  We learn about what happened to the mother and why she's not around.  Back in 1991 when this movie was first released, I used to compare the absence of a mother to the hit TV show Full House.  I find the grandmother being exceptionally quiet a somewhat eerie piece of writing, especially since the family lives in a funeral home.  The grandmother just sits around all the time, occasionally singing for no reason whatsoever, and sometimes Anna comes over and comforts her.Also, whenever Anna would run to the doctor downtown and complain of either a sickness of some sorts or a chicken bone caught in her throat, this totally reminded me of myself at that age.  I'd *always* assume the worst was happening to me whenever something unexplainable or painful would occur in my body.  These segments provided a nice trip down memory lane.You know given the popularity of My Girl, I'm really surprised Anna Chlumksy never went on to even bigger things in her career.  Instead she seemed to sort of drift out of the movie business by only making a few appearances from time to time.  She never really found the success spotlight ever again.  I think she's a beautiful girl (now a woman obviously, about my age).  Her big bright eyes really light up her character.  She's also very intelligent for her age (11).  I think she should have been just as popular as, say, Drew Barrymore.  Wasn't meant to be I suppose.Overall, well it's a comedy that's intended for young teens, but hey, even some of us grown ups might give My Girl a watch sometime.  Nothing wrong with that.  Really, there's not!  Anna's relationship with Maucaulay Culkin is just too adorable for words.  I highly recommend it.",5,what a girl,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,3272,"['have', 'several', 'memories', 'associated', 'My', 'Girl', 'most', 'notable', 'one', 'seafood/see', 'food', 'segment', 'showing', 'Anna', 'Chlumksy', 'opening', 'mouth', 'outside', 'dinner', 'party', 'revealing', 'mouthful', 'chewed', 'food', 'father', 'girlfriend', 'haha', 'Back', '1991/92', 'was', '4th', 'grade', 'ALL', 'classmates', 'were', 'imitating', 'same', 'exact', 'segment', 'coming', 'up', 'other', 'students', 'asking', 'Do', 'seafood', 'Pretty', 'soon', 'joke', 'got', 'worn', 'out', 'when', 'was', 'realized', 'nobody', 'was', 'falling', 'anymore', 'stopped', 'other', 'memorable', 'scene', 'bumper', 'cars', 'What', 'innocent', 'little', 'game', 'Anna', 'character', 'dad', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'quickly', 'serious', 'when', 'woman', 'Anna', 'focusing', 'bumping', 'only', 'HER', 'car', 'Why', 'Anna', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'father', 'was', 'dating', 'woman', 'death', 'mom.Of', 'course', 'beehive', 'segment', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'saddest', 'moment', 'entire', 'movie', 'almost', 'hard', 'believe', 'pleasant', 'tone', 'up', 'point-', 'moment', 'so', 'sad', 'actually', 'soundtrack', 'incredible', 'love', '60', 'early', '70', 'music', 'scene', 'will', 'absolutely', 'love', 'selections', 'being', 'played', 'here', 'Creedence', 'Clearwater', 'Revival', 'Sly', 'Family', 'Stone', 'course', 'Temptations', 'yeah', 'YOU', 'know', 'song', ""'m"", 'referring', 'are', 'only', 'small', 'sample', 'songs', ""'ll"", 'hear.Despite', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'enormous', 'success', '1990', 'Home', 'Alone', 'My', 'Girl', 'mainly', 'Anna', 'Chlumksy', 'family', 'friend', 'issues', 'especially', 'relationship', 'father', 'played', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'learn', 'what', 'happened', 'mother', 'why', 'not', 'around', 'Back', '1991', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'used', 'compare', 'absence', 'mother', 'hit', 'TV', 'show', 'Full', 'House', 'find', 'grandmother', 'being', 'exceptionally', 'quiet', 'somewhat', 'eerie', 'piece', 'writing', 'especially', 'family', 'funeral', 'home', 'grandmother', 'just', 'time', 'occasionally', 'singing', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'sometimes', 'Anna', 'comforts', 'her.Also', 'whenever', 'Anna', 'would', 'run', 'doctor', 'downtown', 'complain', 'sickness', 'sorts', 'chicken', 'bone', 'caught', 'throat', 'totally', 'reminded', 'age', ""'d"", '*always*', 'assume', 'worst', 'was', 'happening', 'something', 'unexplainable', 'painful', 'would', 'occur', 'body', 'segments', 'provided', 'nice', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane.You', 'know', 'given', 'popularity', 'My', 'Girl', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'Anna', 'Chlumksy', 'never', 'went', 'even', 'bigger', 'things', 'career', 'Instead', 'seemed', 'sort', 'drift', 'movie', 'business', 'only', 'making', 'few', 'appearances', 'time', 'time', 'never', 'really', 'found', 'success', 'spotlight', 'ever', 'again', 'think', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'now', 'woman', 'obviously', 'age', 'big', 'bright', 'eyes', 'really', 'light', 'up', 'character', 'also', 'very', 'intelligent', 'age', '11', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'as', 'popular', 'say', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'suppose.Overall', 'well', 'comedy', 'intended', 'young', 'teens', 'hey', 'even', 'grown', 'ups', 'might', 'give', 'My', 'Girl', 'watch', 'sometime', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'Really', 'not', 'Anna', 'relationship', 'Maucaulay', 'Culkin', 'just', 'too', 'adorable', 'words', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
165636,A1ZAVMB4XZL8KA,0800177991,"Bookreader79424 ""I love Casa Ole!""","[0, 0]","I give ""My Girl"" 5-stars because it's entertaining, delightful, & appropriate for everyone and at the same time, humorous in some remote instances!I saw this film as a junior in high school in sociology, and thought it was not only a poignant family touching on topics such as death and learning to cope with it, but also learning how to cope with a new stepmother when you have been raised by a single parent.""My Girl"" is about a little girl, whose dad played by John Akroyd is a funeral parlor director and owner. The little girl lives with her grandmother and her father in a rather large, old house that serves as both a funeral home and the family's main residence.While, you may be thinking that it's inappropriate for young children, this film's focal point is about a little girl, her best friend and growing up as opposed to any creepy themes associated with death; after all, this film is a drama NOT an inappropriate scary movie, but I digress, but anyhow, her father hires a makeup artist, Jamie Lee Curtis, who teaches the little girl, the main character in the film, about makeup, boys and growing up, an ideal film for mothers and daughters to watch together. Jamie Lee Curtis befriends the little girl, and they become best friends, which isn't the main point of the film, but a minor detail, and the little girl learns about loss, and coping with it with the aid of her new best friend and step-mother.I highly recommend this film for anyone who would like to teach their children at a young age, maybe 10 or older, about death because the characters in the film treat death delicately without focusing too much on the sadness surrouding it, which is a rather difficult topic to discuss, but well-worth examining when teaching your children about death and coping with it.The other topic it focuses on besides; death is adjusting to a new stepmother and the bond that develops between the two characters in the story. Therefore, the main themes are growing up, learning to cope with loss, and adjusting to a new blended family.*(Highly recommended for children ages 10 and above due to the death theme).",5,"Cute, entertaining, & humorous...that's what one reviewer is saying about this delightful film",1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,2120,"['give', 'Girl', '5-stars', 'entertaining', 'delightful', 'appropriate', 'everyone', 'same', 'time', 'humorous', 'remote', 'instances', 'saw', 'film', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'sociology', 'thought', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'poignant', 'family', 'touching', 'topics', 'such', 'death', 'learning', 'cope', 'also', 'learning', 'how', 'cope', 'new', 'stepmother', 'when', 'have', 'been', 'raised', 'single', 'parent', 'Girl', 'little', 'girl', 'dad', 'played', 'John', 'Akroyd', 'funeral', 'parlor', 'director', 'owner', 'little', 'girl', 'lives', 'grandmother', 'father', 'rather', 'large', 'old', 'house', 'funeral', 'home', 'family', 'main', 'residence.While', 'may', 'be', 'thinking', 'inappropriate', 'young', 'children', 'film', 'focal', 'point', 'little', 'girl', 'best', 'friend', 'growing', 'up', 'as', 'opposed', 'creepy', 'themes', 'associated', 'death', 'film', 'drama', 'NOT', 'inappropriate', 'scary', 'movie', 'digress', 'anyhow', 'father', 'makeup', 'artist', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'who', 'little', 'girl', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'makeup', 'boys', 'growing', 'up', 'ideal', 'film', 'mothers', 'daughters', 'watch', 'together', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'little', 'girl', 'become', 'best', 'friends', ""n't"", 'main', 'point', 'film', 'minor', 'detail', 'little', 'girl', 'loss', 'coping', 'aid', 'new', 'best', 'friend', 'step-mother.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'teach', 'children', 'young', 'age', 'maybe', '10', 'older', 'death', 'characters', 'film', 'treat', 'death', 'delicately', 'focusing', 'too', 'much', 'sadness', 'surrouding', 'rather', 'difficult', 'topic', 'discuss', 'well-worth', 'examining', 'when', 'teaching', 'children', 'death', 'coping', 'it.The', 'other', 'topic', 'besides', 'death', 'adjusting', 'new', 'stepmother', 'bond', 'two', 'characters', 'story', 'Therefore', 'main', 'themes', 'are', 'growing', 'up', 'learning', 'cope', 'loss', 'adjusting', 'new', 'blended', 'family', '*', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'children', 'ages', '10', 'above', 'due', 'death', 'theme']",N/A
165637,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,0800177991,Carlisle Wheeling,"[0, 0]","Meet the inimitable Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky).  It isn't bad enough she is not a popular girl, thinks she killed her mother at birth, has a special friend who is allergic to everything, Thomas J. Sennett,(who is played demurely by Macaulay Culkin), but her father Harry Dan Aykroyd)owns a funeral parlor and enbalms several people he's known all his life.  Worse yet, Vada's Gramu is slipping away to a neverland far away in her old age while Harry avoids close contact with his daughter who has a crush on her English teacher Mr. Bixler (Griffin Dunne).  Then it happens:  Shelly Devoto (Jamie Lee Curtis), the woman Harry hires as a mortician cosmetic and begins a romance with.  Vada's worst fear yet, tied with her cofusion over death of the corpses in her house.This movie is very funny, heartbreaking, and so easy to relate to no matter what your age.  It helps if you were around the same age as Vada and Thomas J., and it also helps if you remember a time when people didn't go about in such technological whizzings.  Don't want to spoil several key moments of humor or the plot, but can undoubtedly assure you that this is a great movie no matter what age you are.  You will be pleasantly surprised that (unlike that creature in Problem Child with John Ritter), the children in this brilliantly sensitive and funny film can act.  Anna Chlumsky was a great debut find here, and it's just a shame she hasn't gone off to far greater things.Smart, funny, sensitive, and touching because of the fine cast, this is a family film worth viewing repeatedly.  I hate the sequel, it is godawful, and this movie is all you really need anyway.  It is nothing new, but it is special in a way that nobody can deny, and Anna Chlumsky is better than special.

165638,APXZRLC8LO165,0800177991,Carly,"[2, 2]","There are some sad movies out there that are worth the tears because of the lesson they offer. ""My Girl"" is a good example. After watching it for the first time in a while, I have grown to appreciate it a lot more. It certainly is not the type of film to show your children (too much depth and too much reference to death); It is, however, a beautiful yet heartbreaking story that will touch your heart.The story focuses on the plight of Vada Sultenfuss, an 11-year-old girl being raised in a funeral home by her widowed father. As a young girl who sees death every day of her life, Vada knows ""a thing or two about death"" (in her father's words), but it is actually much more than that. As an attempt to cover up what she is feeling every single day as a result of this lifestyle, she becomes obsessed with death, especially her own, and claims that she is cursed with an array of diseases, perhaps to make it easier on herself. Her distant and grieving father Harry can't help her, and when a makeup artist named Shelley enters their world and wins Harry's affections, it is Vada who gets pushed to the back. Her relationship with Shelley is quite different and very real; you can tell she likes her, but she can't stomach the fact that this woman is perhaps shoving her even further away from what she really needs from her father. Vada's emotional problems are made quite clear to the viewer; her one true confidant is Thomas J, her only friend in the world and, eventually, the one who would put her to perhaps the worst test that a child could undertake and snap Vada's life into a completely different position.Anna Chlumsky does a wonderful job in her debut as Vada; even at this age, she showed herself as a very sharp and worthy young actress. Macaulay Culkin is also a charmer as Thomas J and will steal your heart. Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis round up the main cast, both of whom turn in good performances. I actually saw Aykroyd in Britney Spears' film ""Crossroads"" before I realized that he was in this movie, and after seeing him as Britney's waaaay overprotective father, it seemed strange to see the different type of character he played in ""My Girl."" He's pretty good at both roles.This is a sad movie. A very, very, very sad movie.

165651,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,0800177991,General Breadbasket,"[12, 13]","I remember when ""My Girl"" came out in cinemas. I was in third grade, I was at a new school, and it was the start of a new term. First thing we had to do is get into partners and tell the other person what you'd done over the holidays. I still hadn't made any proper friends yet, so no one really wanted to be my partner. I told the teacher, and he told off the class for not being very friendly. That was embarrassing, but it got me a partner. And what had I done over the holidays? I'd gone and seen ""My Girl"", so I talked about that...The girl of the film's title is an eleven year old named Vada (Anna Chlumsky), and she's a little strange. Still, that's understandable given the company she's grown up with. Her all too busy father (Dan Aykroyd) runs a funeral parlour in their home, her mother is dead, her grandmother is senile, her best friend Thomas J. (Macaulay Culkin) is allergic to everything, and the other girls in town tease her about her friendship with him. Is it any wonder that Vada is confused about death and love? It is the summer of 1972, a summer where Vada will learn a little, grow up a little, laugh a little, cry a little, sing a little. It'll be a summer she never forgets.This film looks a little older than the early 1990s, and I think that's a little bit deliberate. Might of been a filter, might have been the type of film they used, I don't know. Everything looks a little dusty and old, like a faded photograph at times. It really works well against the scenery, particularly the lake and the trees, rather idyllic. The cast plays nicely against the backdrop, particularly the young actors Macaulay Culkin and Anna Chlumsky. It's a shame Anna hasn't been in anything lately. I wonder what she's doing these days? It's always nice to see a bit of Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis too. The characters they all play are intriguing, especially the way they react to what happens in the story.It's a sad film at times. There's one scene at the funeral parlour where the pastor is quoting a verse from the Bible, the part where Jesus says ""let the children come to me"", and Vada, really upset runs up to the front. It was heartbreaking and symbolic. I cried just recently watching that bit.When I was a kid, seeing the film for the first time back in third grade, I didn't think Vada's life in a funeral parlour was that strange. Looking back on it, I can see I was a bit like her back then. I was a bit confused about death for a few reasons as well. I'd say it's a good film about coming to terms with death, actually.Definitely worth a look. Good cast, good story, good scenery.

165654,ACKDSX71VI5HY,0800177991,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[1, 1]","SPOILERS FOLLOW""My Girl"" is a modern classic.  A 1991 comedy-drama starring Dan Aykroyd, Jamie Leigh Curtis, Macaulay Culkin, and Anna Chlumsky, it steps expertly between genuine laughs and genuine heartache.Mr. Aykroyd is Harry Sultenfuss, a kind, middle-aged widower running a funeral parlor out of his home.  Ms. Chlumsky is his daughter Vada, a preternaturally mature preteen who suffers from hyponchondria because of the emotional affects of constantly living around death.  Vada can be her most pleasantly childlike around her best friend Thomas J Sennett.  Thomas J is a fairly awkward child prone to allergies, and as played by Macaulay Culkin, a sweet, sympathetic kid.  In the relationship between Thomas J and Vada, the viewer sees an ideal, easy and friendly relationship between a boy and a girl.  As the film plays out, a new woman in Harry Sultenfuss' life, played by Jamie Leigh Curtis, helps him see that his young daughter needs him badly to be present in her life.This remains, in many ways, a powerful movie because it artfully addresses the rude changes in life that we often cannot see coming.  Macaulay Culkin gives one of the two best performances of his juvenile career(the other being in 1993's ""The Good Son"") as Thomas J Sennett.  He was cute and sweet in ""Uncle Buck"" and the first two ""Home Alone"" movies, but he could easily fall back on catchphrases and cute gestures in those movies.  Here, he can only rely on natural talent, and maybe in some measure, experience.  Anna Chlumsky is perfect as Vada Sultenfuss, natural and endearing.  Known as an expert comedian on ""Saturday Night Live"" and black comedies like ""Ghostbusters,"" Dan Aykroyd gives a versatile, dry performance as Harry Sultenfuss.Nominally set in 1972, the themes of this movie can extend to any era because they encapsulate the idyllic potential of childhood and the first sudden jolt that often signifies the onset of adulthood.

I admit, I'm a real sucker for these movies (my best friend knows me best-thank God for her; that's how I can relate to this tear-jerker). I cried at the end of this movie. SPOILER AHEAD!!! My favorite scene is when Vada (Anna Chlumsky, in a heart-breaking performance) cries over Thomas J.'s (Mac. Culkin) coffin. God, that scene literally ripped me in two. Jamie Lee Curtis (daughter of the late Janet Leigh (from ""Psycho"" fame) and Tony Curtis (""Spartacus,"" ""The Great Race"")) and Dan Akroyd (""Pearl Harbor"") are well-cast as a wandering woman whom Vada initially resents for trying to marry her overworking father to escape from her past experiences in life, but then comes to love at the end, and her dad, who works as an undertaker.

But no matter how young/old I am when I watch it, I always end up trying to wipe away the tears, so no one notices! Highly embarrassing. About as bad as crying on a bus. But I think I'll be in my rocking chair, complaining about not being able to get my teeth in and I'll still be crying over this movie!The movie is taken from a child's point of view, that of Vada Sultenfuss', played by Anna Chlumsky, who has since disappeared from the acting world. Although there are rumours of My Girl 3, called ""Still My Girl"". I think it would be fantastic for another one, although I don't see how they can do a grown up version of it really. Vada experiences everything in this movie: her first kiss (which wasn't that great, but I suppose everyone says their first kiss is their worst!), death, hormones, growing up, fancying a school teacher, a possible new mum, a screwed up gran, and life as a young girl who's best friend just so happens to be a boy. She's also a hypochondriac, who has had a chicken bone stuck at the back of her throat, and is practically on first terms with the doctor's receptionist. Her dad ignores her, and she thinks she killed her mum.All this is nicely wrapped up in a sweet little film, with an outstanding cast: Dan Akyroyd, Jamie Lee Curtis (with hair) and an incredibly young Macaulay Culkin, before he divorced his parents and hit puberty.The sequel is just as cute, but definitely not as touching. This will tug at your heartstrings, and have you bawling at whatever grand old age you are. I think what the movie is trying to say is what would you say to someone before they died/went away/lost touch. And I hate the thought of that ever happening.If you've never seen this movie, then you don't know what you're missing out on.

You can read the other excellent posts for details about the movie, but here's some info found inside the DVD liner notes which I haven't seen posted yet.  By the way, the DVD liner notes have a nice 10""x7"" picture of the kiss by the lake!  It looks like it's a picture not from the movie, but a regular camera. A nice promo shot. Good enough reason to get the DVD!  Fans of this movie will enjoy having this picture.The DVD notes explain that the story was inspired by first-time screen writer Laurice Elehway's recollections of her hometown, Hanover, Pennsylvania. Over 1000 young actresses were auditioned for the role of Vada, which of course Anna Chlumsky was choosen.The notes also explain that to capture the look and feel of summertime Pennsylvania, during a winter production schedule, MY GIRL was shot in and around Orlando, FL.  Director Howard Zieff wanted a Norman Rockwell look, so lighting, color, sets, and props were carefully choosen.  Thrift shops and flea markets were scouted for props and a Hanover radio station asked listeners for items from the late 60's.  That's how items in the movie like old newspapers, telephone books, etc were found.For Jamie's motor home, producers located and purchased a rare renovated 1968 Ultra Vision.The only extra on the DVD is the short movie trailer.  There are no out-takes, etc...

However, there is a message at the beginning that says ""this film has been modified from it's original version.  It has been formatted to fit your TV"".

She made the father see that his family needed him, and especially his daughter.I thought that the death scene was so sad! I saw this back in 1992 after a young friend of mine died...My friend and I cried and cried when this scene was playing on the screen. For those concerned might want to prescreen this first..

She never met her mother because her mother died when she was born. Vada lives with her widowed father who owns a funeral parlor and the funeral parlor happens to be Vada's home, as well. Vada is obsessed with death because she sees dead people coming into her home every day. Her best friend is a boy named Tommy J. (Macaulay Culkin) who is allergic to just about anything you can think of. Vada is also in love with her school teacher. When Vada's father hires a cosmatologist to put makeup on the dead people (and ends up falling in love with her), Vada soon starts to learn the true meaning of life. This flick also stars Dan Aykroyd as Vada's father, Jamie Lee Curtis as Shelly, the woman Vada's father falls in love with, and newcomer Anna Chlumsky as Vada. This is a great coming-of-age story that is very moving and at the same time, enjoyable and entertaining. With an all-star cast and serpurb acting, MY GIRL is a great movie to watch anytime!

It ranks as the most entertaining, heartwarming stories about coming-of-age and apply yourself parenthood. About a mannerly, awkward little guy named Thomas (Macaulay Culkin) becomes the object of 11 year-old Vada Sultenfuss' affections (Amy Chlumsky). Vada is distant from her father, Harry (Dan Aykroyd). Vada never knew her mother. Her mother died when she was born. So, naturally in such emotional surroundings, her dad runs a funeral home. She is obsessed with death. Things begin to see light when a make-up artist, Shelly Devoto (Jamie Lee Curtis) answers Harry's job want ad. She's one smart cookie who gets Harry to realize that life isn't just death...don't ignore the living..especially his daughter. Vada is very mature for her age and has a kind of wisdom for someone her age. There are some funny lines here and there. My favorite is Vada and Thomas walking home from school. Vada asks, ""Why do you think people want to get married?"" and Thomas replies ""When you get old, you just have to"". You can feel the emotion after Thomas is fatally stung by a hive of bees. It's easy for younger kids to view it, as it's geniusly pieced together to filter the aftershock. Vada must realize her best friend has gone, and her look at life and death had changed. She gives a lovely eulogy about, ""The Weeping Willow....he left one day/Is it because he could not stay/He found shelter in your shade/...../ for there is something to calm your fears; / If you think death has ripped you forever apart / I know he'll always be in your heart."" In the end, Harry and Shelby become capable parents for Vada. 'My Girl' is a bittersweet tale of growing up and single parents becoming a family again that the whole family will enjoy. It'll make you wanna cry and smile all at the same time. I got that title soundtrack song in my head by The Temptations that won't go away :), ASIN: B00000284Z.

165680,ADB8XCKNSDY5Z,0800177991,theboombody,"[1, 1]","Whenever I think of this movie, I think of the death of the Thomas character and nothing else, but there's really much more to the movie than that.  This could have been a very deep and moving film even if the whole bee-stinging incident was completely left out.Okay, the movie starts out with a glimpse of the Sultenfuss family in their funeral home.  And if I misspell any names they'll just have to remained misspelled, since I don't have the energy to look all this stuff up.  Let me comment on something else, too. I watched this movie multiple times as a kid, and I still freaking forgot that the main character lived in a funeral home.  That is a major, MAJOR part of the movie.  How could I forget it?  Amazing.Well anyway, a woman shows up at the door of the funeral home asking for the make-up artist job.  It seems that the owner of the home was smart enough to leave any reference to ""deceased"" out of the job description title in the newspaper.  But the woman is a good sport and takes the job anyway, and since she lives in a motorhome she's there practially all the time, so she becomes like one of the family.Well, while all this is going on, we follow the daughter of the funeral home owner, Veda, to see what a day in her life is like.  It seems she constantly goes to a doctor and complains about how sick she is.  We also find out she has a crush on her teacher, and because of him she's inspired to be a writer.  So much that she takes a college level writing class over the summer.  Pretty impressive for an [..], or however old she is.She never hangs around with other girls, and spends all her time hanging around with her best friend Thomas instead.  And although they do everything together, I still felt I didn't know very much at all about Thomas.  I don't know if this was intentional on the part of the film makers or not.  Honestly, it didn't seem that too much camera time was devoted to Thomas.  The vast majority was spent on Veda and her dad.  Her dad actually plays a big, big part of this movie.  In fact, I would say that the development of his romantic relationship with the makeup lady and the effect it has on Veda is really the meat of the film.  The sudden death of Thomas at the end and its particular effect is just the exclamation point to this long buildup.Overall, this movie is a detailed account of an extraordinary character who already has a disposition to sadness and still is forced to face major issues at such a young age in life.  I would say its even deeper than the Bridge to Terebithia book, which My Girl might have stemmed from.  Honestly, as I watched this I found myself believing Veda wrote her own lines, because they're so much like what a child would say, especially in her wonderful description of Heaven.I always used to think the title My Girl referred to her being Thomas's girl, then for a while I thought it referred to her being her dad's girl, and now I'm thinking that she's really the audience's girl.  We as the audience are privileged to see all her dreams and secrets and fears that her writing teacher asks for but is only blessed enough to see after she confronts those fears at the very end of the movie.Unless you can find a film that does a better job of addressing these issues, I would recommend My Girl as a must-see.",5,"Extremely powerful, with an effect that last decades",1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,3306,"['Whenever', 'think', 'movie', 'think', 'death', 'Thomas', 'character', 'nothing', 'else', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'deep', 'moving', 'film', 'even', 'whole', 'bee-stinging', 'incident', 'was', 'completely', 'left', 'out.Okay', 'movie', 'out', 'glimpse', 'Sultenfuss', 'family', 'funeral', 'home', 'misspell', 'names', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'remained', 'misspelled', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'energy', 'look', 'up', 'Let', 'comment', 'something', 'else', 'too', 'watched', 'movie', 'multiple', 'times', 'kid', 'still', 'freaking', 'forgot', 'main', 'character', 'lived', 'funeral', 'home', 'major', 'MAJOR', 'part', 'movie', 'How', 'could', 'forget', 'Amazing.Well', 'anyway', 'woman', 'up', 'door', 'funeral', 'home', 'asking', 'make-up', 'artist', 'job', 'owner', 'home', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'leave', 'reference', 'deceased', 'job', 'description', 'title', 'newspaper', 'woman', 'good', 'sport', 'job', 'anyway', 'motorhome', 'practially', 'time', 'one', 'family.Well', 'going', 'follow', 'daughter', 'funeral', 'home', 'owner', 'Veda', 'see', 'what', 'day', 'life', 'constantly', 'doctor', 'complains', 'how', 'sick', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'crush', 'teacher', 'inspired', 'be', 'writer', 'So', 'much', 'college', 'level', 'writing', 'class', 'summer', 'Pretty', 'impressive', '[', '..', ']', 'however', 'old', 'never', 'hangs', 'other', 'girls', 'time', 'hanging', 'around', 'best', 'friend', 'Thomas', 'instead', 'do', 'everything', 'together', 'still', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'very', 'much', 'Thomas', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'intentional', 'part', 'film', 'makers', 'not', 'Honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'too', 'much', 'camera', 'time', 'was', 'devoted', 'Thomas', 'vast', 'majority', 'was', 'spent', 'Veda', 'dad', 'dad', 'actually', 'big', 'big', 'part', 'movie', 'fact', 'would', 'say', 'development', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'makeup', 'lady', 'effect', 'Veda', 'really', 'meat', 'film', 'sudden', 'death', 'Thomas', 'end', 'particular', 'effect', 'just', 'exclamation', 'point', 'long', 'buildup.Overall', 'movie', 'detailed', 'account', 'extraordinary', 'character', 'who', 'already', 'disposition', 'sadness', 'still', 'forced', 'face', 'major', 'issues', 'young', 'age', 'life', 'would', 'say', 'even', 'deeper', 'Bridge', 'Terebithia', 'book', 'My', 'Girl', 'might', 'have', 'stemmed', 'Honestly', 'watched', 'found', 'believing', 'Veda', 'wrote', 'own', 'lines', ""'re"", 'so', 'much', 'what', 'child', 'would', 'say', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'description', 'Heaven.I', 'always', 'used', 'think', 'title', 'My', 'Girl', 'referred', 'being', 'Thomas', 'girl', 'then', 'while', 'thought', 'referred', 'being', 'dad', 'girl', 'now', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'really', 'audience', 'girl', 'audience', 'are', 'privileged', 'see', 'dreams', 'secrets', 'fears', 'writing', 'teacher', 'asks', 'only', 'blessed', 'enough', 'see', 'fears', 'very', 'end', 'movie.Unless', 'can', 'find', 'film', 'better', 'job', 'addressing', 'issues', 'would', 'recommend', 'My', 'Girl', 'must-see']",N/A
