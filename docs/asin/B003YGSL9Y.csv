He loves it and picks up the remote control, stands in front of the t.v. and tries to get someone's attention to turn on his DVD! So cute! It also gives a tired adult a full 28 minutes of respite while he watches it nonstop! I'll be looking for others to order him soon!",5,Noah loves it!,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,405,"['purchased', 'kit', 'Christmas', 'gift', '16', 'month', 'old', 'grandson', 'Noah', 'received', 'timely', 'manner', 'time', 'Christmas', 'up', 'remote', 'control', 'front', 't.v', 'tries', 'get', 'someone', 'attention', 'turn', 'DVD', 'So', 'cute', 'also', 'tired', 'adult', 'full', '28', 'minutes', 'respite', 'nonstop', ""'ll"", 'be', 'looking', 'others', 'order', 'soon']",Baby Einstein: Animals Around Me Discovery Kit

Once I tossed these discovery kits in the mix, her vocabulary has flourished. The videos are simplistic and appealing to the eye.

1376323,AGP718IN9UHGK,B003YGSL9Y,Jr,"[5, 5]","My 18 month old really enjoys this DVD.  She loves all the animals in it, and it maintains her focus.  The discovery cards were a nice bonus as well, but the print on them is upside down, so it is hard to show your toddler the card and read the discussion points. Hence the 4 stars.  Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for babies under 1 since the pace of the program won't keep their attention, but it is nice for older ones. Otherwise, a very cute and well designed program.",4,Great for toddlers who love animals,1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,486,"['18', 'month', 'old', 'really', 'DVD', 'animals', 'focus', 'discovery', 'cards', 'were', 'nice', 'bonus', 'as', 'well', 'print', 'upside', 'down', 'hard', 'show', 'toddler', 'card', 'read', 'discussion', 'points', 'Hence', '4', 'stars', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'recommend', 'babies', '1', 'pace', 'program', 'wo', ""n't"", 'keep', 'attention', 'nice', 'older', 'ones', 'Otherwise', 'very', 'cute', 'well', 'designed', 'program']",Baby Einstein: Animals Around Me Discovery Kit
