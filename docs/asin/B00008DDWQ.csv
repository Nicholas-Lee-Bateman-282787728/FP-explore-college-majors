Well The script was terrible,  the story even worse,  direction - don't get me started.  One reviewer said it,  it was like they didn't know whose point of view to choose.  The soundtrack was awful.  The ending was sooo stupid.  did anyone else see the people at the docks leaning against the rail as three people are shot in front of them...  they just keep standing there.  Like nothing is happening.  I really haven't seen a movie this bad in... well...  EVER!!  Oh and Alyson Hannigan's acting was way better in My stepmother is an alien. I think she was about 13 in that role.  Don't get me wrong she's a extremely talented actress...  I blame it on the script.rent it,  don't buy it.  You'll be embarassed to own it.

Unfortunately, Alyson is the ONLY bright spot in this movie and there was not even enough of her. It was truly painful to watch at times. Everyone else's acting was atrocious. Jennifer Esposito should have her Guild card revoked for her performance. The story was awful, the script worse. If you're an Alyson Hannigan fan, watch it once for her performance.

Nastassja Kinski (Cat People, One Night Stand), Alyson Hannigan (Boys and Girls, Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Jennifer Esposito (Tv's Spin City, Master Of Disguise), Brian McCradie (Speed 2: Cruise Control), Steve Harris (Tv's The Practice, Minority Report), Todd Field (Stranger Than Fiction, Twister) and even the always awesome Alexis Denisof (Tv's Angel, Rouge Trader) are all burned out with a soggy script and its way too familiar and formulaic. It's about what adds up to be a bad bank robbery with everyone shooting each other up at the end. I really thought the accents of both McCradie and Denisof trying to do Russians was bad. McCradie is Irish isnt he and Denisof is like British..no, I'm not buying it for one second.
