The trainers are good, one slightly irritating but its only for 10 minutes and she is just trying to be positive. The moves are doable but really work your muscles and because its 10minutes you keep telling yourself its almost over I can do this. I really like this dvd and would recommend it to others.",5,Great workouts!,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",2014,431,"['just', 'received', 'dvd', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'week', 'feel', 'sore', 'good', 'way', 'places', 'tell', 'working', 'trainers', 'are', 'good', 'one', 'slightly', 'irritating', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'just', 'trying', 'be', 'positive', 'moves', 'are', 'doable', 'really', 'work', 'muscles', '10minutes', 'keep', 'telling', 'almost', 'can', 'do', 'really', 'dvd', 'would', 'recommend', 'others']",BeFit: 30-Day Butt Lift

I will update after a month or so to give my final nay or yay and explain results if any. I seriously feel sore already and I only did ten minutes. And those ten minutes were definitely felt. Will update later on.UPDATE6/6/2014 I have lowered my 4 star rating to a 4. I have been doing this for a month now and I do see results. I just don't like how quick the workouts seem and for me I would love if they thoroughly explained what each move really does instead of just briefly talking about. I also wish there were booty boostin tips, such as eating certain foods and what kind of cardio to do. I guess I just feel the dvd was rushed. Either way I love it and will continue to keep doing it.

I bought this for myself, but my daughter is having more success with it so far. The workouts are challenging and you WILL feel the BURN! I haven't even mastered the first one yet, despite being in reasonable shape (I can do my kettlebell workouts with no problem!) There's something about putting one leg behind me with my foot on a chair--and squatting with the other leg--that I just can't seem to master. Some of the exercises are awkward and require good balancing skill, but they are all effective exercises. It'll just take me some time to get used to this.

1671901,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B00FKTCXGA,Leanne,"[45, 47]","I'm an advanced exerciser and have about 300 or so workout DVDs in my collection.  My problem area is always my lower half (thanks, Italian genes!), so I'm always on the lookout for glute-focused workouts.  A friend had mentioned that she purchased this and had been having nice muscle soreness (DOMS), so I decided to get it.  I've only done a few of the workouts, but I really like it so far!The DVD comes with six workouts:*  Tone-Up -- 12 minutes -- squats, lunges, and bridge work*  Booty Booster -- 10 minutes -- cardio focus, includes some ab and arm work*  Firm Extreme -- 9 minutes -- ballet-inspired moves*  Fat-Burning Cardio -- 10 minutes -- cardio that focuses on moves that work the lower half*  Booty Yoga -- 10 minutes -- yoga-focused moves*  Dance Fit Buns -- 10 minutes -- dance workoutThe DVD comes with a rotation calendar.  The idea is that the first two weeks, you do one workout a day; the third week, you do two workouts a day; and the fourth week, you do three workouts a day.  Each week also has one or two rest days.  Since these are so short, my plan is to follow the rotation schedule, and do these workouts as add-ons, before I do my main workout  for the day.To do the workouts, you'll need:*  a mat*  a pair of light handweights*  a chairThe design of the DVD menu is also great.  When you put it in, you can choose which individual segment you want, or you can go to the 30-day plan, and it will play the workout(s) scheduled for that day.The backdrop of this is also beautiful and motivating.  It's filmed next to an infinity pool with the ocean in the background, and is lovely to look at.The two instructors take turns leading the workouts (there is only one instructor for each one, with no background exercisers), and they are good instructions, although a bit unpolished.  (For instance, they aren't as smooth with their transitions between exercises and stumble a bit on some words, as if not completely rehearsed.)  Despite that, I like them both.  I had heard of Alicia Marie since she used to write a monthly column for _Oxygen_ magazine, but haven't heard of Courtney Prather before.Also, if you want to try this out before purchasing it, all of the workouts are available on You Tube.  I ended up buying it for the convenience of being able to play it on the DVD player in my workout room.I will be sure to update my review after I use this more, but, so far, it's a nice way to get in some extra glute work if you don't want to commit to a longer program like Brazil Butt Lift.",4,A great way to fit in some extra glute work!,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,2523,"[""'m"", 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'have', '300', 'so', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'collection', 'problem', 'area', 'always', 'lower', 'half', 'thanks', 'Italian', 'genes', ""'m"", 'always', 'lookout', 'glute-focused', 'workouts', 'friend', 'had', 'mentioned', 'purchased', 'had', 'been', 'having', 'nice', 'muscle', 'soreness', 'DOMS', 'decided', 'get', ""'ve"", 'only', 'done', 'few', 'workouts', 'really', 'so', 'far', 'DVD', 'six', 'workouts', '*', 'Tone-Up', '12', 'minutes', 'squats', 'lunges', 'bridge', 'work*', 'Booty', 'Booster', '10', 'minutes', 'cardio', 'focus', 'ab', 'arm', 'work*', 'Firm', 'Extreme', '9', 'minutes', 'ballet-inspired', 'moves*', 'Fat-Burning', 'Cardio', '10', 'minutes', 'cardio', 'moves', 'work', 'lower', 'half*', 'Booty', 'Yoga', '10', 'minutes', 'yoga-focused', 'moves*', 'Dance', 'Fit', 'Buns', '10', 'minutes', 'dance', 'workoutThe', 'DVD', 'rotation', 'calendar', 'idea', 'first', 'two', 'weeks', 'do', 'one', 'workout', 'day', 'third', 'week', 'do', 'two', 'workouts', 'day', 'fourth', 'week', 'do', 'three', 'workouts', 'day', 'week', 'also', 'one', 'two', 'rest', 'days', 'are', 'so', 'short', 'plan', 'follow', 'rotation', 'schedule', 'do', 'workouts', 'add-ons', 'do', 'main', 'workout', 'day.To', 'do', 'workouts', ""'ll"", 'need', '*', 'mat*', 'pair', 'light', 'handweights*', 'chairThe', 'design', 'DVD', 'menu', 'also', 'great', 'When', 'put', 'can', 'choose', 'individual', 'segment', 'want', 'can', 'go', '30-day', 'plan', 'will', 'play', 'workout', 'scheduled', 'day.The', 'backdrop', 'also', 'beautiful', 'motivating', 'filmed', 'next', 'infinity', 'pool', 'ocean', 'background', 'lovely', 'look', 'at.The', 'two', 'instructors', 'take', 'turns', 'leading', 'workouts', 'only', 'one', 'instructor', 'one', 'background', 'exercisers', 'are', 'good', 'instructions', 'bit', 'unpolished', 'instance', 'are', ""n't"", 'smooth', 'transitions', 'exercises', 'stumble', 'bit', 'words', 'not', 'completely', 'rehearsed', 'like', 'had', 'heard', 'Alicia', 'Marie', 'used', 'write', 'monthly', 'column', '_Oxygen_', 'magazine', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Courtney', 'Prather', 'before.Also', 'want', 'try', 'out', 'purchasing', 'workouts', 'are', 'available', 'Tube', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'convenience', 'being', 'able', 'play', 'DVD', 'player', 'workout', 'room.I', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'update', 'review', 'use', 'more', 'so', 'far', 'nice', 'way', 'get', 'extra', 'glute', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'commit', 'longer', 'program', 'Brazil', 'Butt', 'Lift']",BeFit: 30-Day Butt Lift

Both instructors have a good, positive energy and the background is pretty nice/not distracting. The way it's broken up into separate workouts that range from 9 min to 12 min, works perfect. The exercises aren't overly difficult but still very challenging. I'm an intermediate exerciser but did have some trouble at first with some repetitions. Overall it's not that expensive and also includes a 30 day breakdown of which segment to do as part of the '30 day butt lift.'I am doing one segment a day along with running, Jeanette Jenkins Cardio Kickboxing, and Jillian Michaels Tone Your Trouble Zones, and Zumba.

I do barre type exercises 5 to 6 days a week along with a dedicated yoga practice and find these segments diverse and beneficial. I don't find myself struggling hard through them but often am sore the next day. Which I love! It's like a quick reward for me, knowing my muscles are changing :). I like both instructors but at first prefered the blonde due to queuing. The only section I can't comment on is the cardio section since I have a foot injury and can't do some of the hi intensity interval jumping type moves but there are 6 sections so the 5 are perfect for me. I also wish there were a way for me to get the schedule since I bought the amazon instant video.
