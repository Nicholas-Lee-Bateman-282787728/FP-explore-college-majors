Plus, I can't read Japanese.This may have been a Kurosawa crew problem, as the lower part of the picture seemed slightly out of alignment, and may have cut off the subtitles, and showed only the top line when there was more than one line of dialog.Unfortunately, I could not figure out any way to re-align the picture, so it may have been a DVD problem. Very disappointing, as I had looked forward to watching this movie.Nothing made any sense, and it was just too difficult to try to figure out what was happening.

1215225,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,B001LMU1B4,Gerard D. Launay,"[18, 20]","During the 1950's, my father was a fashion designer who spent months in Japan every year.  During that time he came back home and told me he had been profoundly moved by a film he viewed in Japan - a Kurosawa masterpiece entitled ""Ikiru.""  Perhaps a year or two later I had the chance to see the movie - and yes, I too, was deeply, even spiritually changed by the film.  Many others, perhaps thousands, have encountered this effect.The film opens in Tokyo with Mr. Watanabe, perhaps in his early 60's, as a low level office clerk stamping papers for his superiors - actions without meaning.  When he starts feeling gastric pain, he visits a doctor and learns, to his horror, that he has only a few months to live and has contracted a painful stomach cancer.  Like some who learn they have contracted AIDS or another terminal illnesses, he is forced to review what he has accomplished in his life. In this soul searching,  he comes to the conclusion his life has meant little to others.Scared, he goes into the Tokyo night district and is attracted to a young woman - a person of youth - as if contact with her would change his fortune. But on reflection, he realizes that he must search elsewhere, within himself, for the solution to what matters in his life.  Shortly thereafter, he is confronted with a standard document at work, an application for approval to build a playground for young children in the inner city.In the past, Watanabe would have routinely stamped the project ""denied"" or taken no responsibility at all...but this time, looking at his life, he decides differently.  Of course, Mr. Watanabe, by himself, has no power to approve the project, so he makes it his life's work - for the months that he has left - to see that the children's playground gets approved and is actually built.  It is through these efforts that Watanabe's life takes a turn to radiance.One could argue that the film does not have the technical photographic perfection of, let's say, Director Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samurai"" or ""Throne of Blood.""  Nevertheless in a quiet and profound way, the film is actually more powerful, more moving, more life-affirming.  There are several moments in the film that deeply touch the viewers...one in which Mr Watanabe sings to himself a melancholy folk ballad that the young should enjoy life for ""life is short.""  The second is a moment when he observes a gorgeous sunset and realizes that he has not taken the time in his life to contemplate, or to meditate, on the beauty of that experience.Indeed, I consider the movie one of the 25 best black and white films ever made.  Kurasawa's ""Ikiru"" is therefore not about dying but about life, about living, about the choices we make in obtaining life.What does the film mean to me, today? In those situations where I  falter and need ""inner strength,"" I remember the film to find that secret energy to remain true to my integrity and life spirit.",5,One of the Greatest Films of All Time  - An Exploration of Inner Strength,1234828800,"02 17, 2009",2009,2922,"['1950', 'father', 'was', 'fashion', 'designer', 'who', 'spent', 'months', 'Japan', 'year', 'time', 'came', 'back', 'home', 'told', 'had', 'been', 'profoundly', 'moved', 'film', 'viewed', 'Japan', 'Kurosawa', 'masterpiece', 'entitled', 'Ikiru', 'Perhaps', 'year', 'two', 'later', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'movie', 'yes', 'too', 'was', 'deeply', 'even', 'spiritually', 'changed', 'film', 'Many', 'others', 'perhaps', 'thousands', 'have', 'encountered', 'effect.The', 'film', 'Tokyo', 'Mr.', 'Watanabe', 'perhaps', 'early', '60', 'low', 'level', 'office', 'clerk', 'stamping', 'papers', 'superiors', 'actions', 'meaning', 'When', 'feeling', 'gastric', 'pain', 'doctor', 'learns', 'horror', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'live', 'contracted', 'painful', 'stomach', 'cancer', 'who', 'learn', 'have', 'contracted', 'AIDS', 'terminal', 'illnesses', 'forced', 'review', 'what', 'accomplished', 'life', 'soul', 'searching', 'conclusion', 'life', 'meant', 'little', 'others.Scared', 'Tokyo', 'night', 'district', 'attracted', 'young', 'woman', 'person', 'youth', 'contact', 'would', 'change', 'fortune', 'reflection', 'must', 'search', 'elsewhere', 'solution', 'what', 'matters', 'life', 'Shortly', 'thereafter', 'confronted', 'standard', 'document', 'work', 'application', 'approval', 'build', 'playground', 'young', 'children', 'inner', 'city.In', 'past', 'Watanabe', 'would', 'have', 'routinely', 'stamped', 'project', 'denied', 'taken', 'responsibility', 'time', 'looking', 'life', 'differently', 'course', 'Mr.', 'Watanabe', 'power', 'approve', 'project', 'life', 'work', 'months', 'left', 'see', 'children', 'playground', 'approved', 'actually', 'built', 'efforts', 'Watanabe', 'life', 'turn', 'radiance.One', 'could', 'argue', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'technical', 'photographic', 'perfection', 'let', 'say', 'Director', 'Kurosawa', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'Throne', 'Blood', 'Nevertheless', 'quiet', 'profound', 'way', 'film', 'actually', 'more', 'powerful', 'more', 'moving', 'more', 'life-affirming', 'are', 'several', 'moments', 'film', 'deeply', 'viewers', 'one', 'Mr', 'Watanabe', 'sings', 'melancholy', 'folk', 'ballad', 'young', 'should', 'enjoy', 'life', 'life', 'short', 'second', 'moment', 'when', 'gorgeous', 'sunset', 'not', 'taken', 'time', 'life', 'contemplate', 'meditate', 'beauty', 'experience.Indeed', 'consider', 'movie', 'one', '25', 'best', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Kurasawa', 'Ikiru', 'therefore', 'not', 'dying', 'life', 'living', 'choices', 'make', 'obtaining', 'life.What', 'film', 'mean', 'today', 'situations', 'where', 'falter', 'need', 'inner', 'strength', 'remember', 'film', 'find', 'secret', 'energy', 'remain', 'true', 'integrity', 'life', 'spirit']",Ikiru - Essential Art House
1215226,A2XR4C4TOS3XS1,B001LMU1B4,"Jim Altfeld ""Management Consultant""","[0, 0]","As we grow older, we become far more insightful and introspective.  We question the life we've lived and seek to define our purpose.  The two best days in our lives are the day we are born and the day we discover why we were born.  This movie hits directly upon this topic, but in a different way than I was expecting.  Not only must the protagonist determine his purpose, but he does so working within the worst bureaucracy ever created.... the Government.  The movie does an exceptional job of pointing out the challenges we face as we begin nearing the end of our journey, as well as pointing out the problems associated with a government run society.This is NOT a dark movie.  It is not light and airy, either.  To get the most out of this movie, I suggest you read the Death of Ivan Ilyich by Tolstoy.  By the title and the author, it may sound like 14 tons of bituminous coal heavy, but it really isn't.  It's a very short story, quick to read, but very poignant.  Regarding the movie, yes, there are sub-titles and yes, the movie is in black and white, but what the movie conveys is well worth the time and effort to watch it and read the sub-titles as you go.  Plus, if it were filmed in color it would lose a great deal of its effect.",5,A Life Un-Lived & Un-Inspected,1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,1243,"['grow', 'older', 'become', 'far', 'more', 'insightful', 'introspective', 'question', 'life', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'seek', 'define', 'purpose', 'two', 'best', 'days', 'lives', 'are', 'day', 'are', 'born', 'day', 'discover', 'why', 'were', 'born', 'movie', 'directly', 'topic', 'different', 'way', 'was', 'expecting', 'Not', 'only', 'must', 'protagonist', 'determine', 'purpose', 'so', 'working', 'worst', 'bureaucracy', 'ever', 'created', 'Government', 'movie', 'exceptional', 'job', 'pointing', 'out', 'challenges', 'face', 'begin', 'nearing', 'end', 'journey', 'as', 'well', 'pointing', 'out', 'problems', 'associated', 'government', 'run', 'society.This', 'NOT', 'dark', 'movie', 'not', 'light', 'airy', 'either', 'get', 'most', 'movie', 'suggest', 'read', 'Death', 'Ivan', 'Ilyich', 'Tolstoy', 'title', 'author', 'may', 'sound', '14', 'tons', 'bituminous', 'coal', 'heavy', 'really', ""n't"", 'very', 'short', 'story', 'quick', 'read', 'very', 'poignant', 'Regarding', 'movie', 'yes', 'are', 'sub-titles', 'yes', 'movie', 'black', 'white', 'what', 'movie', 'conveys', 'well', 'time', 'effort', 'watch', 'read', 'sub-titles', 'go', 'were', 'filmed', 'color', 'would', 'lose', 'great', 'deal', 'effect']",Ikiru - Essential Art House
