1111450,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,B000WS4SBC,Brian,"[3, 4]","Don't be deterred by Cheezy Flicks' name or checkered reputation-- the picture and audio quality of this charming little British fable are fine; in fact, considering it's an inexpensive public-domain print, I would rate this release of 'The Man Who Could Work Miracles' good to very good.  As for the film, Wells' anti-fascist message (as you might expect) does get heavy-handed at times, but thanks to Roland Young's expert performance as the meek everyman endowed with temporary omnipotence, a brisk script and a slate of top-notch supporting players (the most memorable being Ralph Richardson as pie-eyed Colonel Winstanley), the proceedings are kept mainly buoyant.  3 1/2 stars each for presentation and content.",4,Cheezy Flicks transfer is fine,1320710400,"11 8, 2011",2011,717,"['Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'deterred', 'Cheezy', 'Flicks', 'name', 'checkered', 'reputation', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'charming', 'little', 'British', 'fable', 'are', 'fine', 'fact', 'considering', 'inexpensive', 'public-domain', 'print', 'would', 'rate', 'release', ""'The"", 'Man', 'Who', 'Could', 'Work', 'Miracles', 'good', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Wells', 'anti-fascist', 'message', 'might', 'expect', 'get', 'heavy-handed', 'times', 'thanks', 'Roland', 'Young', 'expert', 'performance', 'meek', 'everyman', 'endowed', 'temporary', 'omnipotence', 'brisk', 'script', 'slate', 'top-notch', 'supporting', 'players', 'most', 'memorable', 'being', 'Ralph', 'Richardson', 'pie-eyed', 'Colonel', 'Winstanley', 'proceedings', 'are', 'kept', 'mainly', 'buoyant', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'presentation', 'content']",N/A

It's a wonderful story of a very meek man [Roland Young} who worked in a small department store, that was given the power of God, by the gods in heaven, just to see how he would use it. It's a cute story, kinda far fetched, but I think you'll like it. I guess you could classify it, as almost a sci-fi.

They get simple appearance and disappearance more perfect than many episodes of Bewitched.  And at one point, my jaw literally dropped (as the old clich&eacute; goes) and it took a while for me to notice that I was sitting there with my mouth hanging open.  Given the time it was made, this one amazing shot had more impact than most CGI effects do today.The story is at once fun, sweet, alarming, funny, and somewhat deep.It starts out a light hearted comedy, and then becomes a light hearted drama, and suddenly, without warning, huge things start to happen.  I was fascinated beginning to end and highly recommend it.",5,"Nearly perfect film with great effects, great story, And great acting...",1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,707,"['not', 'perfect', '1936', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'astonishing', 'really', 'are', 'get', 'simple', 'appearance', 'disappearance', 'more', 'perfect', 'many', 'episodes', 'Bewitched', 'one', 'point', 'jaw', 'literally', 'dropped', 'old', 'clich', 'eacute', 'took', 'while', 'notice', 'was', 'sitting', 'there', 'mouth', 'hanging', 'open', 'Given', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'one', 'amazing', 'shot', 'had', 'more', 'impact', 'most', 'CGI', 'effects', 'do', 'today.The', 'story', 'once', 'fun', 'sweet', 'alarming', 'funny', 'somewhat', 'deep.It', 'out', 'light', 'hearted', 'comedy', 'then', 'light', 'hearted', 'drama', 'suddenly', 'warning', 'huge', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'was', 'fascinated', 'beginning', 'end', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

1111454,A295OPF6HX7XFP,B000WS4SBC,Oldest & Wisest,"[26, 26]","""The Man Who Could Work Miracles"" is a marvelous humorous fantasy the screenplay of which was both written by and based on a short story by the great early science fiction writer H. G. Wells of ""Time Machine"" and ""The War of the Worlds"" fame.""Miracles"" tells of a Mr. Fotheringay, a simple dry goods clerk in early 20th England who is given the power to work miracles by a god who wants to see what use he will make of it.  Starring Roland Young (best known in this country as the original ""Cosmo Topper"" in the film ""Topper.""  The film is highly entertaining as it depicts Mr. Fotheringay's adventures and also raises some genuine moral and philosophical issues about how power should be used and its limits.  The FILM is highly recommended.On the other hand, this is a lousy transfer of the film to DVD, blurry and with a constant annoying flicker.  True, the film is nearly 70 years old, but I have a transfer that I made from a laserdisc copy I owned to a DVD-R which is still far superior in quality to this one.  In this case, the name of the publisher ""Cheezy Flicks"" is, I'm afraid, merely a case of truth in advertising!",3,"Great movie, lousy transfer",1200441600,"01 16, 2008",2008,1129,"['Man', 'Who', 'Could', 'Work', 'Miracles', 'marvelous', 'humorous', 'fantasy', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'based', 'short', 'story', 'great', 'early', 'science', 'fiction', 'writer', 'H.', 'G.', 'Wells', 'Time', 'Machine', 'War', 'Worlds', 'fame', 'Miracles', 'tells', 'Mr.', 'Fotheringay', 'simple', 'dry', 'goods', 'clerk', 'early', '20th', 'England', 'who', 'given', 'power', 'work', 'miracles', 'god', 'who', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'make', 'Starring', 'Roland', 'Young', 'best', 'known', 'country', 'original', 'Cosmo', 'Topper', 'film', 'Topper', 'film', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'Mr.', 'Fotheringay', 'adventures', 'also', 'genuine', 'moral', 'philosophical', 'issues', 'how', 'power', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'limits', 'FILM', 'highly', 'recommended.On', 'other', 'hand', 'lousy', 'transfer', 'film', 'DVD', 'blurry', 'constant', 'annoying', 'flicker', 'True', 'film', 'nearly', '70', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'transfer', 'made', 'laserdisc', 'copy', 'owned', 'DVD-R', 'still', 'far', 'superior', 'quality', 'one', 'case', 'name', 'publisher', 'Cheezy', 'Flicks', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'merely', 'case', 'truth', 'advertising']",N/A
