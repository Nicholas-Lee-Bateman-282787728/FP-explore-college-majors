Hype, flashy wardrobe and heavily-publicized bizarre behavior often deflects media attention away from the efforts of humble but more talented musical artists. Chicago pulled a real coup when they recruited him but, in my opinion, Bill shines best at the helm of his own musical endeavors, either as a solo artist or fronting the Sons of Champlin. This DVD features Bill in a performance environment he seems completely at home with. The sound is good and the sidemen are exceptional. I don't think many Bill Champlin fans would be disappointed owning this DVD.",5,Bill Stands Head and Shoulders Above Most Others,1104278400,"12 29, 2004",2004,745,"['Bill', 'Champlin', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', '30', 'years', 'being', 'eclipsed', 'lesser', 'light', 'pop', 'stars', 'finally', 'be', 'gaining', 'recognition', 'deserved', 'so', 'long', 'Hype', 'flashy', 'wardrobe', 'heavily-publicized', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'often', 'media', 'attention', 'away', 'efforts', 'humble', 'more', 'talented', 'musical', 'artists', 'Chicago', 'pulled', 'real', 'coup', 'when', 'recruited', 'opinion', 'Bill', 'best', 'helm', 'own', 'musical', 'endeavors', 'either', 'solo', 'artist', 'fronting', 'Sons', 'Champlin', 'DVD', 'Bill', 'performance', 'environment', 'completely', 'home', 'sound', 'good', 'sidemen', 'are', 'exceptional', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'Bill', 'Champlin', 'fans', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed', 'owning', 'DVD']",N/A

It was refreshing to finally hear one at the very end of the show, ""Everywhere"", but it would have been amazing to hear ""Freedom"", ""Things are Getting Better"", and one or two of the other superb songs off ""Loosen Up Naturally"".In the meantime, there's that amazing DVD with Bill and the rest of Chicago, teaming up with Earth, Wind and Fire- that may sound strange, but trust me, it's superb!But I could have sworn I once saw a clip of the Sons playing live somewhere, and if the overall sound is anything like their live CD (from the '90s?) then ""that"" would be the ultimate Bill Chaplin DVD!",4,"PRETTY GOOD, BUT GIVE US ""THE SONS""",1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,746,"['very', 'good', 'show', 'done', 'Germany', 'Heat', 'Night', 'great', 'wish', 'Bill', 'would', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'Sons', 'Champlin', 'material', 'was', 'refreshing', 'finally', 'hear', 'one', 'very', 'end', 'show', 'Everywhere', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'hear', 'Freedom', 'Things', 'are', 'Getting', 'Better', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'superb', 'songs', 'Loosen', 'Up', 'Naturally', 'meantime', 'amazing', 'DVD', 'Bill', 'rest', 'Chicago', 'teaming', 'up', 'Earth', 'Wind', 'Fire-', 'may', 'sound', 'strange', 'superb', 'could', 'have', 'sworn', 'once', 'saw', 'clip', 'Sons', 'playing', 'live', 'somewhere', 'overall', 'sound', 'anything', 'live', 'CD', ""'90s"", 'then', 'would', 'be', 'ultimate', 'Bill', 'Chaplin', 'DVD']",N/A

For one of the most underrated and talented musicians, he and his band put on a hell of a show.  The song selection was also well planned.  That's one thing that I've always liked about Bill: even if you don't know any of his songs, he makes you feel as if you've known them forever!  Not many artists have that impact on me.
