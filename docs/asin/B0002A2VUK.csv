Venn ""Aaron""","[10, 14]","This has been arguably the most enjoyable import i have got this year.Over here in Australia we have just barely started seeing the 2nd series of NewlyWeds on free-to-air tv here, so naturally i snapped up this 'smile time' variey hour excitedly.But what shocked me was that it was really funny.A prime example was when Nick decided to introduce his favourite Baseball playing friend.'Oh Dear' I thought aloud.But luckily it turned to a classic case of audience abuse, and everyone can enjoy that.Jessica working at an 'ole style Saloon with the power to read dirty thoughts which results in Nick all wet...10 Seconds Of Awkwardness with Mr T was another example of irreverence that i enjoyed....But what topped it off was the music. The songs were delightful.Oh, and Jess Pole Vaulting...So if you havent seen it, or heard of it (Australian people)buy it now and laugh.",5,It's The Nick & Jessica Smile Time Variety Family Wish Hour!,1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,870,"['been', 'arguably', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'import', 'i', 'have', 'got', 'year.Over', 'here', 'Australia', 'have', 'just', 'barely', 'started', 'seeing', '2nd', 'series', 'NewlyWeds', 'free-to-air', 'tv', 'here', 'naturally', 'i', 'snapped', 'up', ""'smile"", 'time', 'variey', 'hour', 'excitedly.But', 'what', 'shocked', 'was', 'was', 'really', 'funny.A', 'prime', 'example', 'was', 'when', 'Nick', 'decided', 'introduce', 'favourite', 'Baseball', 'playing', 'friend', ""'Oh"", 'Dear', 'thought', 'aloud.But', 'luckily', 'turned', 'classic', 'case', 'audience', 'abuse', 'everyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'that.Jessica', 'working', ""'ole"", 'style', 'Saloon', 'power', 'read', 'dirty', 'thoughts', 'results', 'Nick', 'wet', '10', 'Seconds', 'Awkwardness', 'Mr', 'T', 'was', 'example', 'irreverence', 'i', 'enjoyed', '.But', 'what', 'topped', 'off', 'was', 'music', 'songs', 'were', 'delightful.Oh', 'Jess', 'Pole', 'Vaulting', 'So', 'havent', 'seen', 'heard', 'Australian', 'people', 'buy', 'now', 'laugh']",The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour

I love the show and I don't see the negatives that people talk about.  This however was different.  I can't beleive they need the money, so Jessica and Nick - DON""T DO THIS AGAIN.  I couldn't believe they did such stupid rubbish and kept a straight face.  It's fine to do songs along with other famous singers, but don't sing with a car, and don't do pole-vaulting across the stage and then act high at other times.Yes there are some good moments in this, but overall,?

829033,A2LNEZD3YBO12O,B0002A2VUK,Preston,"[7, 9]","Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson have a few good moments in the Nick and Jessica Variety Hour. But the show looks too '70s in its premise, too Donny and Marie-ish in some parts and Sonny and Cher-in some others.  Lachey's performance with Babyface is nice. How come Babyface didn't produce Nick's entire solo album instead of the batch of people Nick went to that caused Soul-O to flop?  He would have given him some smooth stuff to sing to. But having Mr. T and Johnny Bench and Kenny Rogers makes the show look, sadly, too 1983-ish. How come they couldn't get somebody current to perform on it, say Maroon 5 or Kanye West, who were both hot last April? They wanted to bring back the variety show format, but it's very hard to do it in an Internet age.  And Jessica isn't all that good on this show. I'd rather hear her music and albums instead. They need to bring new things to the format if they're going to make another show. For now, Lachey and Simpson would be better off doing their solo albums than wasteful junk like this!",2,It looks too '70s  and 1983-like,1105574400,"01 13, 2005",2005,1030,"['Nick', 'Lachey', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'have', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'Nick', 'Jessica', 'Variety', 'Hour', 'show', 'too', ""'70s"", 'premise', 'too', 'Donny', 'Marie-ish', 'parts', 'Sonny', 'Cher-in', 'others', 'Lachey', 'performance', 'Babyface', 'nice', 'How', 'come', 'Babyface', 'did', ""n't"", 'produce', 'Nick', 'entire', 'solo', 'album', 'instead', 'batch', 'people', 'Nick', 'went', 'caused', 'Soul-O', 'flop', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'smooth', 'stuff', 'sing', 'having', 'Mr.', 'T', 'Johnny', 'Bench', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'show', 'look', 'sadly', 'too', '1983-ish', 'How', 'come', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'somebody', 'current', 'perform', 'say', 'Maroon', '5', 'Kanye', 'West', 'who', 'were', 'hot', 'last', 'April', 'wanted', 'bring', 'back', 'variety', 'show', 'format', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'Internet', 'age', 'Jessica', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'show', ""'d"", 'rather', 'hear', 'music', 'albums', 'instead', 'need', 'bring', 'new', 'things', 'format', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'show', 'now', 'Lachey', 'Simpson', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'doing', 'solo', 'albums', 'wasteful', 'junk']",The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour
