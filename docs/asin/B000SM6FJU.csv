She is enthusiastic without being perky, motivating and always is clear with her cueing and instructions.  I was hesitant to try this video because I've never done Pilates.  But, Chris makes it easy to follow.  I liked the variety of Pilates, Kick-boxing and aerobics and got a good workout.  Using weights was challenging, at times, but very beneficial.  I'm 52, in pretty good shape and do an exercise video 5 times each week.",4,Give Pilates a try!,1237334400,"03 18, 2009",2009,551,"['have', 'five', 'other', 'exercise', 'videos', 'starring', 'Chris', 'Freytag', 'also', 'have', 'videos', 'other', 'popular', 'instructors', 'Chris', '1', 'enthusiastic', 'being', 'perky', 'motivating', 'always', 'clear', 'cueing', 'instructions', 'was', 'hesitant', 'try', 'video', ""'ve"", 'never', 'done', 'Pilates', 'Chris', 'easy', 'follow', 'liked', 'variety', 'Pilates', 'Kick-boxing', 'aerobics', 'got', 'good', 'workout', 'Using', 'weights', 'was', 'challenging', 'times', 'very', 'beneficial', ""'m"", '52', 'pretty', 'good', 'shape', 'do', 'exercise', 'video', '5', 'times', 'week']",Prevention Fitness: Shortcuts to Big Weight Loss

There are three workouts that I linked together for one great session. While I see that at least one reviewer disliked the choice to place the pilates in the middle of the DVD, I have to disagree; you burn the most fat calories when you do intervals of cardio, and the choice to do cardio toning, followed by the pilates, and then the high-energy kickboxing made total sense to me and gave me a great interval workout. All of the moves will be achievable by beginners, but if you're more advanced you'll still feel it. I felt firmer and tighter after finishing, and I highly recommend this DVD as a great overall body toner and cardio session.",5,Great Cardio Toning,1352160000,"11 6, 2012",2012,749,"['was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'quality', 'DVD', 'especially', 'found', 'discounted', 'store', 'are', 'three', 'linked', 'together', 'one', 'great', 'session', 'see', 'least', 'one', 'reviewer', 'disliked', 'choice', 'place', 'pilates', 'middle', 'DVD', 'have', 'disagree', 'burn', 'most', 'fat', 'calories', 'when', 'do', 'intervals', 'cardio', 'choice', 'do', 'cardio', 'toning', 'followed', 'pilates', 'then', 'high-energy', 'kickboxing', 'made', 'total', 'sense', 'gave', 'great', 'interval', 'workout', 'moves', 'will', 'be', 'achievable', 'beginners', ""'re"", 'more', 'advanced', ""'ll"", 'still', 'feel', 'felt', 'firmer', 'tighter', 'finishing', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'great', 'overall', 'body', 'toner', 'cardio', 'session']",Prevention Fitness: Shortcuts to Big Weight Loss
1086759,A1KEK09ZA6J9P8,B000SM6FJU,Colleen M. Schneider,"[1, 1]","I often look for new dvds and instructors to try to keep my workouts fresh and keep myself in good shape.  This is the first I have done in the prevention series.  Here are the likes/dislikes:The instructor shows good form, is enthusiastic but not too over the top.  The workouts are cued well and get started quickly which is good because they are each only 10 minutes long.  As a daily exerciser a 10 minute workout is used for a couple purposes, to add to another workout for some additional work or to combine as in this case with the other workouts on the dvd to make a longer workout.  With three 10 minute workouts I still was a bit short on time I would normally spend working out.  The workouts were well done but nothing that I felt like I would want to do again and again.  I didn't feel like as a daily exerciser this one was really for me.Who I think this workout is for: Someone who is not a huge fan of exercise, who wants to work out for a short span of time, burn some calories, but doesn't really want to spend a lot of time doing it.  This would also be good for someone in the beginner/intermediate range.  Someone who wanted a warm and friendly instructor, would also find this dvd to be a good one.  You will get a workout and not spend a lot of time doing it and you can expand and do more than one segment as you grow stronger and gain more stamina.Overall, a well done workout, but not one that I would purchase for myself, though I would recommend for others who are looking for a well done workout for someone who is on the go and has minimal time that they want to spend exercising.",3,Well cued exercises with demonstration of good form...,1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,1610,"['often', 'look', 'new', 'dvds', 'instructors', 'try', 'keep', 'workouts', 'fresh', 'keep', 'good', 'shape', 'first', 'have', 'done', 'prevention', 'series', 'Here', 'are', 'likes/dislikes', 'instructor', 'good', 'form', 'enthusiastic', 'not', 'too', 'top', 'workouts', 'are', 'cued', 'well', 'get', 'started', 'quickly', 'good', 'are', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'long', 'daily', 'exerciser', '10', 'minute', 'workout', 'used', 'couple', 'purposes', 'add', 'workout', 'additional', 'work', 'combine', 'case', 'other', 'workouts', 'dvd', 'make', 'longer', 'workout', 'three', '10', 'minute', 'workouts', 'still', 'was', 'bit', 'short', 'time', 'would', 'normally', 'spend', 'working', 'out', 'workouts', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'nothing', 'felt', 'would', 'want', 'do', 'again', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'daily', 'exerciser', 'one', 'was', 'really', 'me.Who', 'think', 'workout', 'Someone', 'who', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'exercise', 'who', 'work', 'out', 'short', 'span', 'time', 'burn', 'calories', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'doing', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'good', 'someone', 'beginner/intermediate', 'range', 'Someone', 'who', 'wanted', 'warm', 'friendly', 'instructor', 'would', 'also', 'find', 'dvd', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'will', 'get', 'workout', 'not', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'doing', 'can', 'expand', 'do', 'more', 'one', 'segment', 'grow', 'stronger', 'gain', 'more', 'stamina.Overall', 'well', 'done', 'workout', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'purchase', 'would', 'recommend', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'well', 'done', 'workout', 'someone', 'who', 'go', 'minimal', 'time', 'want', 'spend', 'exercising']",Prevention Fitness: Shortcuts to Big Weight Loss

This DVD is great for beginners and advanced alike, though it would benefit from an additional 10 minute section.  This is an effective, well-rounded workout, but intermediate and advanced exercisers may not find it particularly challenging.  I also think they should have put the pilates segment at the end, because that way you won't have to take your shoes off only to put them back on.

1086762,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B000SM6FJU,Little Miss Cutey,"[33, 34]","I have almost all of Preventions dvds.  They are great because you can do only a little workout, or combine all segments for one long workout.  Plus, they aren't intimidating or too challenging that you won't do them.  All the instructors are fantastic and Chris is excellent in this as she usually is.In this particular workout, there are three different 11 minute segments.  There's cardio sculpt, pilates and kickbox.  I love the pilates section where you also use dumbbells to increase the effect (like a bicep curl along with a bicycle).  If you like kickboxing, you are in luck - it's fast and fun and totally fat burning.  At the end of the dvd there is a 6 minute tutorial.All you need are some dumbbells and plenty of energy.  I've done this twice already and really enjoy it.  Chris is bubbly as usuall and I love how you can pick and choose what exercises you do and how long your routine is going to be.

Its shorter too, maybe cause it's more difficult, they shortened it.Theres a warm up and cool down. Then it's broken into 3 sections.  The first is cardio sculpt.  This is what I found difficult.  Chris recommends 2-3 lbs weights due to its intensity.  You do multiple squats, plies and lunges with the weights at a faster pace.  Some of the moves I can use 4 or 5 lbs, but some, even the 2 or 3 hurt my arms alot.The second 10 min. is milder aerobics and abs.  Nothing hard here.  But the ab workout is really good and you'll feel it.The last 10 min is kickboxing.  It gets pretty intense at the end.
