1667507,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00EJU9GQ6,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[3, 5]","I&#8217;ve always loved films involving history, but I&#8217;ve always struggled with those more biographical in nature when they&#8217;re centered on a single person.  Mostly, I tend to believe &#8216;no man is an island, and that means there are usually an awful lot of others he meets along the way who contribute to whatever legacy he builds.  Does that make his claim to said legacy fraudulent?  Of course it doesn&#8217;t; it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve rarely seen an individual memoir-on-film truly measure up a single life if it doesn&#8217;t account for those additional influences along the way.So imagine how impossibly difficult it might be to capture an account of Winnie Mandela, especially given the fact that her husband Nelson led an equally captivating set of experiences?  No doubt, all involved trusted this was going to be difficult, and, in the final estimation, I&#8217;m not certain WINNIE MANDELA gets all that close to the mark with its mostly serviceable performances.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Winnie Mandela (played by a miscast Jennifer Hudson) stays true to the causes she supports with her husband, Nelson (a suitable Terrence Howard).  Yet, once she finds him imprisoned for life, Mrs. Mandela realizes that she must add one more campaign to her already involved life: to work for his release.  As there&#8217;s an entire culture standing against her, she knows it won&#8217;t be easy, but, throughout her efforts, she was awarded the name &#8216;the Mother of a Nation&#8217; by those she inspired.WINNIE MANDELA isn&#8217;t a great film.  Also, it isn&#8217;t a bad film &#8211; rather, I&#8217;d like to think that this feature at 107 minutes is vastly too short.  While I&#8217;m not aware of all the nuances of the personal history involving both Nelson and Winnie Mandela, I still don&#8217;t doubt that there&#8217;s enough &#8216;history&#8217; that could fill up a mini-series easily.  And that&#8217;s the problem here: much of it feels abbreviated, truncated, or just too incomplete.  In fact, the motion picture largely plays out like a highlight reel; the flavor of true experience &#8211; the struggle against insurmountable odds &#8211; only shows up occasionally, such as during the lady&#8217;s incarceration.Sadly, casting Ms. Hudson as that &#8220;Mother of a Nation&#8221; probably hindered the production as well.  Never does she display the gravitas needed to convince audiences (or at least this viewer) of the passion behind her convictions; instead, she goes from one incident to the next, along with an accent that remains about as inconsistent as possible.  To her credit, she musters a few great moments &#8211; such as in the aforementioned prison period &#8211; but that&#8217;s not enough to hoist the weight of this world on to one woman&#8217;s shoulders.Is it entirely improbable that a major motion picture would forego hiring legitimate talent in lieu of bringing in rank amateurs in the make-up department?  I ask this because despite this story spanning multiple decades the grooming staff quite literally couldn&#8217;t make Hudson age in the slightest.  Were they told not to?  Was this some macabre creative decision?  Or did the actress pull a &#8216;diva&#8217; move and demand she appear wrinkle-free as even an aged Winnie?  I hope that wasn&#8217;t the case as Hudson&#8217;s last glimpse in the film feels as if it&#8217;s almost mockery; she&#8217;s clearly in a fat suit &#8211; and not the good kind &#8211; the likes of which are generally reserved for Eddie Murphy fart-joke comedies.  Heck, even Howard&#8217;s last shot &#8211; his Mandela is sitting in a chair while wearing one of the pacifist&#8217;s signature bold (and colorful) prints &#8211; is staged in such a way to nearly evoke parody instead of a respectful final image.I&#8217;ve no doubt that there&#8217;s a truly great story to be told about the Mandelas joint and separate struggles.  Rest assured: this isn&#8217;t it.WINNIE MANDELA (2011) is produced by Ironwood Films, Equinoxe Films, Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa, Movie Central, The Movie Network, National Empowerment Fund, and TDJ Enterprises / New Dimensions Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled through RLJ Entertainment.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is an English-spoken-language film, but there are sections of it spoken in Xhosa with English subtitles.  As is often the case when these smaller releases find a release, it&#8217;s lean on extras: there&#8217;s only a single one &#8211; a brief making of short &#8211; and I certainly would&#8217;ve liked to know more about these two very influential AND controversial people.MODESTLY RECOMMENDED.  WINNIE MANDELA isn&#8217;t an awful film.  Rather, it&#8217;s awfully constructed, awfully costumed, and simplistically made, reducing two noble characters to more-or-less caricatures who seemingly leap from one didactic yet turbulent moment to the next.  The story here doesn&#8217;t feel organic so much as it does the final edit culled together from a shooting script that made mincemeat of what should&#8217;ve been two grand filets.  However, maybe this one is a learning lesson best chalked up to biting off more than you can chew; Hudson is adequate and Howard is palatable, but together they never muster enough chemistry to bring the complexities of these people and the times they shared to cinema life.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at RLJ Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of WINNIE MANDELA by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,"Alas, This Account of WINNIE Is No Winner",1389571200,"01 13, 2014",2014,6027,"['8217', 'always', 'loved',

1667508,A9I40WFF40R4,B00EJU9GQ6,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[27, 31]","I saw this film in a local theatre a couple of Saturdays ago after reading a terribly negative review in the NEW YORK TIMES by Stephen Holden the day before.  He could find nothing much to like about the movie:  The director Darrell J. Roodt was rushed, whatever that means. Terence Howard has too little screen time and is merely a ""stick figure."" Winnie Mandela's role in the events surrounding the death of a teenage boy ""are not explored."" The white characters are basically caricatures.  And finally the reviewer did not like the song  Jennifer Hudson sings with a back-up choir at the end of the film although , as I recall, he does not state his reasons  for his distaste.I am so glad I paid no attention to the review. I went to the movie because I like both Mr. Howard and Ms. Hudson as actors and  I am fascinated by the story of Nelson and Winnie Mandela.  (I will never forget hearing Mr. Mandela-- I believe Ms. Mandela was in attendance-- speak in Atlanta in 1990 soon after his having being freed from all those years as a political prisoner.) I left the theatre wondering if Mr. Holden and I saw the same movie. First these two actors give commanding,  riveting performances. And while it is not a requirement to play a historical figure, both these Mr. Howard and Ms. Hudson resemble Nelson and Winnie Mandela, particularly Mr. Howard to Mr. Mandela, something that adds to their performances. (Think Daniel Day Lewis in ""Lincoln."") I fully expected to see five minutes of the character Nelson Mandela. Wrong.  Even though he is sentenced  to prison at  Robben Island, he remains very much a part of his wife's life, at least for a time, and in the movie. And I ask, can a stick figure weep? The movie is called ""Winnie Mandela""-- based on a biography-- after all. Wouldn't we perhaps expect to see more of  Ms. Mandela than her husband?Some of the white characters certainly are haters of blacks if that is what the reviewer means. On the other hand there are other people-- I'm thinking now of a white woman who hires Winnie for a position-- who are sympathetic toward her and her cause.  I still do no know why I  should not like the song that ends the movie. And it did not appear to me that the director dances around Ms. Mandela's involvement in the death of the young man perceived as a traitor. I thought Mr. Roodt lets the viewer see the transition that takes place in Ms. Mandela. She is portrayed  not as a cardboard character but as a complex human being. And  I'm not sure how most of us would react if a spouse spent 27 years in prison for  believing in freedom for all people.Finally the gorgeous panoramic scenes reminded me that, yes, South Africa is beautiful.I'd give this film an A-. It was a good way to spend two hours of my precious life.",5,Another Excellent Movie Relevant to These Times,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,2778,"['saw', 'film', 'local', 'theatre', 'couple', 'Saturdays', 'ago', 'reading', 'terribly', 'negative', 'review', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'TIMES', 'Stephen', 'Holden', 'day', 'could', 'find', 'nothing', 'much', 'like', 'movie', 'director', 'Darrell', 'J.', 'Roodt', 'was', 'rushed', 'Terence', 'Howard', 'too', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'merely', 'stick', 'figure', 'Winnie', 'Mandela', 'role', 'events', 'surrounding', 'death', 'teenage', 'boy', 'are', 'not', 'explored', 'white', 'characters', 'are', 'basically', 'caricatures', 'finally', 'reviewer', 'did', 'not', 'song', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'sings', 'back-up', 'choir', 'end', 'film', 'recall', 'not', 'state', 'reasons', 'distaste.I', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'paid', 'attention', 'review', 'went', 'movie', 'like', 'Mr.', 'Howard', 'Ms.', 'Hudson', 'actors', 'am', 'fascinated', 'story', 'Nelson', 'Winnie', 'Mandela', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'hearing', 'Mr.', 'Mandela', 'believe', 'Ms.', 'Mandela', 'was', 'attendance', 'speak', 'Atlanta', '1990', 'soon', 'having', 'being', 'freed', 'years', 'political', 'prisoner', 'left', 'theatre', 'wondering', 'Mr.', 'Holden', 'saw', 'same', 'movie', 'First', 'two', 'actors', 'give', 'commanding', 'riveting', 'performances', 'not', 'requirement', 'play', 'historical', 'figure', 'Mr.', 'Howard', 'Ms.', 'Hudson', 'resemble', 'Nelson', 'Winnie', 'Mandela', 'particularly', 'Mr.', 'Howard', 'Mr.', 'Mandela', 'something', 'performances', 'Think', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'Lincoln', 'fully', 'expected', 'see', 'five', 'minutes', 'character', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'Wrong', 'Even', 'sentenced', 'prison', 'Robben', 'Island', 'very', 'much', 'part', 'wife', 'life', 'least', 'time', 'movie', 'ask', 'can', 'stick', 'figure', 'weep', 'movie', 'called', 'Winnie', 'Mandela', 'based', 'biography', 'Would', ""n't"", 'perhaps', 'expect', 'see', 'more', 'Ms.', 'Mandela', 'husband', 'white', 'characters', 'certainly', 'are', 'haters', 'blacks', 'what', 'reviewer', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'other', 'people', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'now', 'white', 'woman', 'who', 'Winnie', 'position', 'who', 'are', 'sympathetic', 'cause', 'still', 'do', 'know', 'why', 'should', 'not', 'song', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'director', 'Ms.', 'Mandela', 'involvement', 'death', 'young', 'man', 'perceived', 'traitor', 'thought', 'Mr.', 'Roodt', 'viewer', 'see', 'transition', 'place', 'Ms.', 'Mandela', 'portrayed', 'not', 'cardboard', 'character', 'complex', 'human', 'being', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'most', 'would', 'react', 'spouse', 'spent', '27', 'years', 'prison', 'believing', 'freedom', 'people.Finally', 'gorgeous', 'panoramic', 'scenes', 'reminded', 'yes', 'South', 'Africa', 'beautiful.I', ""'d"", 'give', 'film', 'A-', 'was', 'good', 'way', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'precious', 'life']",Winnie Mandela

I have watched her blossom into a great actress and a very beautiful woman. She and Terrence Howard whom I also love give riveting performances in Winnie. When they put Winnie in jail for over 400 days in solitary confinement I felt like my heart would burst with sympathy for her, her children and Mandela who was also in prison. The movie makes us aware that Winnie made mistakes but considering the great pressures thrust upon her shoulders I think anyone viewing the movie would have at least a little understanding of what occurred and wish Winnie well.

There's a lot in it that simply never gets seen or heard in this country's entertainment media:  the sights and sounds, accents, backgrounds, habits, assumptions, of a very foreign country, starting decades ago under a radical forced separation of blacks and whites, by the whites, in the blacks' own ancestral homeland, backed up with brutal state power.  Winnie suffers in solitary confinement for months, growing slightly unhinged but never backing down from fierce resistance.  The world knows this story, and the shocking lengths she and/or her camp went to defending against the state security agencies and their informers.  Winnie is never fully understood, and may not be fully understandable; but the film confronts the paradoxes, suggesting explanations, after a marvelous beginning, with Winnie enjoying her life and friends and opportunities; taking a sharp turn after being romanced by the bold idealist Nelson Mandela, giving her all for him and his movement (which didn't turn violent until the state crackdown did, when blacks could not legally become political actors, much less voters; and were relegated to the least productive, and most resource-poor &#34;homelands&#34; reserved for them without their consent).  In the end [SPOILER ALERT], her sacrifice wins much less than she'd hoped, as the controversy over her own camp's brutalities persuades Nelson to divorce her publicly.  After nearly three decades forced apart, she could not share or savor the triumph of the movement and the transformation of a major continental power.Terrance Howard is superb as Mandela, nailing Mandela's accent down to its subtleties, acing a long Swahili monologue, projecting both passionate leadership and cerebral composure in the worst circumstances (the Sharpeville massacre)...while Jennifer gives a beautiful, deeply-felt performance as Winnie, whether glamorized for publicity, sweet in her student innocence, steely in the faces of wickedly harsh police, or wide-eyed and joyous (!) when, with a possibly weakening grip on reality, or adjusting as best she can, she sings to the ants in her prison cell.I won't mention the cumulative effect of a hundred gorgeous close-ups of Ms. Hudson on this besotted fan.",4,"Give history, and freedom, a chance, and see this...",1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,2599,"[""'m"", 'love', 'Jennifer', 'Hudson', 'saw', 'expectations', 'greatly', 'lowered', 'following', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'shelf', 'hostility', 'Winnie', 'Mandela', 'camp', 'poor', 'reviews', '.And', 'was', 'surprised', 'righteously', 'more', 'pleasantly', 'owing', 'subject', 'matter', 'fine', 'film', 'much', 'superior', '34', 'TV-movie', 'quality', '34', 'reviewers', 'damned', 'lot', 'simply', 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'country', 'entertainment', 'media', 'sights', 'sounds', 'accents', 'backgrounds', 'habits', 'assumptions', 'very', 'foreign', 'country', 'starting', 'decades', 'ago', 'radical', 'forced', 'separation', 'blacks', 'whites', 'whites', 'blacks', 'own', 'ancestral', 'homeland', 'backed', 'up', 'brutal', 'state', 'power', 'Winnie', 'suffers', 'solitary', 'confinement', 'months', 'growing', 'slightly', 'unhinged', 'never', 'backing', 'down', 'fierce', 'resistance', 'world', 'story', 'shocking', 'and/or', 'camp', 'went', 'defending', 'state', 'security', 'agencies', 'informers', 'Winnie', 'never', 'fully', 'understood', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fully', 'understandable', 'film', 'paradoxes', 'suggesting', 'explanations', 'marvelous', 'beginning', 'Winnie', 'enjoying', 'life', 'friends', 'opportunities', 'taking', 'sharp', 'turn', 'being', 'romanced', 'bold', 'idealist', 'Nelson', 'Mandela', 'giving', 'movement', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'violent', 'state', 'crackdown', 'did', 'when', 'blacks', 'could', 'not', 'legally', 'become', 'political', 'actors', 'much', 'less', 'voters', 'were', 'relegated', 'least', 'productive', 'most', 'resource-poor', '34', 'homelands', '34', 'reserved', 'consent', 'end', '[', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', ']', 'sacrifice', 'much', 'less', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'controversy', 'own', 'camp', 'brutalities', 'Nelson', 'divorce', 'publicly', 'nearly', 'three', 'decades', 'forced', 'apart', 'could', 'not', 'share', 'savor', 'triumph', 'movement', 'transformation', 'major', 'continental', 'power.Terrance', 'Howard', 'superb', 'Mandela', 'nailing', 'Mandela', 'accent', 'down', 'subtleties', 'acing', 'long', 'Swahili', 'monologue', 'projecting', 'passionate', 'leadership', 'cerebral', 'composure', 'worst', 'circumstances', 'Sharpeville', 'massacre', 'Jennifer', 'beautiful', 'deeply-felt', 'performance', 'Winnie', 'glamorized', 'publicity', 'sweet', 'student', 'innocence', 'steely', 'wickedly', 'harsh', 'police', 'wide-eyed', 'joyous', 'when', 'possibly', 'weakening', 'grip', 'reality', 'adjusting', 'best', 'can', 'ants', 'prison', 'cell.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'cumulative', 'effect', 'hundred', 'gorgeous', 'close-ups', 'Ms.', 'Hudson', 'besotted', 'fan']",Winnie Mandela

Once Nelson Mandela was imprisoned, Winnie took over the movement, crossing the line and doing things, for better or worse, that Nelson wouldn't dare do. One can debate if her militant stance helped or hurt the liberation of South Africa, but it was after decades of peaceful measures failing that lead to a more radical approach.The film contains the expected grand speeches, self sacrifice, tear jerking moments with appropriate sound track. It leaves criticism of Winnie up to the audience.  I felt the acting, which was good, needed to be taken up a notch as it seemed to lack a degree of expected passion. There also seems to be a disconnect between the effect of the movement, world pressure, and the decision to free Mandela and end apartheid which would normally climax a film.

Her contribution to the struggle is beyond calculation.&#34; This movie follows the life of Winnie (Hudson) from birth to her life with husband Nelson Mandela (Howard) and beyond. It shows her transformation from shy student to activist. I hate to admit it but I knew next to nothing about this woman before I started the movie. For that reason going in my first thought was, why make a movie about her when Nelson is much more interesting. After watching this my thoughts changed to why don't they make more movies about her. I'm not sure how accurate this movie is but I found it to be very interesting and really made me feel for her. Seeing a woman who was shy and had her life ahead of her end up being broken by seeing the way her life was affected by her husbands sentence gives you conflicting emotions. On one hand you want her to do the things she is doing while at the same time you know she should stop. The end of the movie is so bittersweet that it's hard to feel happy about what happened. The only really bad thing I have to say about this is that it really had the feel of a Lifetime movie. Overall, my feelings went from why a movie about her to why aren't there more movies about her.
