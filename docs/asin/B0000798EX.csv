The characters all grow up a bit and the season flows along at a nice pace.Just before I move onto reviewing the extras, I would like to say that Mel and Lindsay have come on in leaps and bounds since season one, where I felt that they were often superfluous to the plot.  Here, for the first time, they seem to feel part of the show.There are a multitude of extras on disk 6:folks on the road: a backstage pass  just under 15 minutesFollow the cast as they promote the series.

We get a brief description of the main characters and an 'interview' with the actor/actress playing the part.  The 'interview's are for the most part 30 second soundbites taken from what was probably a good solid interview.  Why they couldn't have put the complete interviews on the DVD is a mystery that will probably never be solved, like who the murderer was of the guy found by Debbie in the dumpster on Liberty Avenue.animated photo galleryOK.tv spots and trailersGay themed adverts and an advert for Showtime featuring the cast of QAF.

725746,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0000798EX,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[3, 3]","Nominated for 9 Craft Awards (bestowed by the Director's Guild of Canada), Queer As Folk is a groundbreaking drama series that has built itself a large cult following since its inception in 2000. Based on a British TV series of the same name, Queer As Folk is in many ways similar to HBO's Sex And The City, and it's one of the first TV dramas to be completely centered around the lives of homosexual characters, or even have prominent homosexual characters - following on the heels of groundbreaking sitcoms such as Ellen (1994) and Will & Grace (1998). The brainchild of UK-born writer and creator Russell T. Davies, Queer As Folk follows the life and times of a group of gay friends as they live out their respective lives in modern-day America...Set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Queer As Folk follows the exploits of a group of gay and lesbian friends who live on or around Liberty Avenue. Most of the scenes take place either in the character's homes, a local diner, or the popular gay nightclub Babylon. Lindsay Peterson (Thea Gill) and Melanie Marcus (Michelle Clunie) comprise the lone lesbian couple to star in the series, while various gay friends and neighbors such as Brian Kinney (Gale Harold), Michael Novotny-Bruckner (Hal Sparks), Justin Taylor (Randy Harrison), Ted Schmidt (Scott Lowell), Emmett Honeycutt (Peter Paige), etc. deal with each other and their own varying relationships. Composed in a drama/soap opera format, Queer As Folk centers wholly on the careers and lives (including sex, drugs, love, friendships, tragedies, etc.) of its diverse characters, maintaining a specific focus on its attempted realistic portrayal and illustration of the American homosexual lifestyle...The Queer As Folk (Season 2) DVD features a number of interesting episodes including the season premiere in which we learn that Brian has been visiting Justin in the hospital every night, but he tells the staff not to let Justin know he's been there. After proper rehab, Justin is released into the care of his mother who lets Brian know that she doesn't want him to see her son anymore. Meanwhile, Lindsay's sister gets married and, while in the act of toasting at the reception, Lindsay rocks the boat by proposing to Melanie... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Episode 210"" in which Michael is distraught with the death of his comic book hero, Captain Astro, and he initializes a campaign to bring him back to life, and ""Episode 216"" in which Melanie and Lindsay take Justin to a violin recital where he meets a new love interest...",5,A groundbreaking drama series...,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,2551,"['Nominated', '9', 'Craft', 'Awards', 'bestowed', 'Director', 'Guild', 'Canada', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'groundbreaking', 'drama', 'series', 'built', 'large', 'cult', 'following', 'inception', '2000', 'Based', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'many', 'ways', 'similar', 'HBO', 'Sex', 'City', 'one', 'first', 'TV', 'dramas', 'be', 'completely', 'centered', 'lives', 'homosexual', 'characters', 'even', 'have', 'prominent', 'homosexual', 'characters', 'following', 'heels', 'groundbreaking', 'sitcoms', 'such', 'Ellen', '1994', 'Will', 'Grace', '1998', 'brainchild', 'UK-born', 'writer', 'creator', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'life', 'times', 'group', 'gay', 'friends', 'live', 'out', 'respective', 'lives', 'modern-day', 'America', 'Set', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pennsylvania', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'exploits', 'group', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'friends', 'who', 'live', 'Liberty', 'Avenue', 'Most', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'either', 'character', 'homes', 'local', 'diner', 'popular', 'gay', 'nightclub', 'Babylon', 'Lindsay', 'Peterson', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'Melanie', 'Marcus', 'Michelle', 'Clunie', 'comprise', 'lone', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'star', 'series', 'various', 'gay', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'such', 'Brian', 'Kinney', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'Michael', 'Novotny-Bruckner', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'Justin', 'Taylor', 'Randy', 'Harrison', 'Ted', 'Schmidt', 'Scott', 'Lowell', 'Emmett', 'Honeycutt', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'etc', 'deal', 'other', 'own', 'varying', 'relationships', 'Composed', 'drama/soap', 'opera', 'format', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'centers', 'wholly', 'careers', 'lives', 'including', 'sex', 'drugs', 'love', 'friendships', 'tragedies', 'etc', 'diverse', 'characters', 'maintaining', 'specific', 'focus', 'attempted', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'illustration', 'American', 'homosexual', 'lifestyle', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'number', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'learn', 'Brian', 'been', 'visiting', 'Justin', 'hospital', 'night', 'staff', 'not', 'let', 'Justin', 'know', 'been', 'there', 'proper', 'rehab', 'Justin', 'released', 'care', 'mother', 'who', 'Brian', 'know', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'son', 'anymore', 'Meanwhile', 'Lindsay', 'sister', 'married', 'act', 'toasting', 'reception', 'Lindsay', 'boat', 'proposing', 'Melanie', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'include', 'Episode', '210', 'Michael', 'distraught', 'death', 'comic', 'book', 'hero', 'Captain', 'Astro', 'campaign', 'bring', 'back', 'life', 'Episode', '216', 'Melanie', 'Lindsay', 'take', 'Justin', 'violin', 'recital', 'where', 'new', 'love', 'interest']",N/A

Included also is a 'next on' clip and a list of all music in each episode with links to the specific sections within the episodes (referred to as the 'video jukebox'). Finally there are episode summaries.Now onto the bonus features on disc 6. A major effort has been undertaken to give fans something special:Folks on the Road: A Backstage Pass - an entertaining 'fly on the wall' documentary featuring most of the main cast doing radio interviews, DVD signings and personal appearances. There are many funny and candid moments from the cast. The quality is amateurish - it looks like a consumer model digital cam was used, though in my opinion this enhances the feel of the documentary.A Day in the Life of QAF - there are 2 featurettes here. 'Sets and Costumes' gives an insight into the wardrobe and construction departments, with many interesting facts divulged. 'The Challenges' gives the viewer a look into how an episode of QAF is made under the time constraint of shooting one episode in 7 days.What Is It About Babylon? - Featurette dedicated to showing how the fantastical Babylon nightclub was created.Wrap Party Reel - the outtakes!!! About 7 minutes worth, and they are hilarious!!!!The Unexpurgated Lady in Pearls - the full clip of the 'do it yourself' video shown in small sections in the episodes. Also included are the outtakes from the filming - hilarious!!!Rage Gay Crusader: The Comic Book - a series of static screens with artwork from the comic book, followed by an extensive featurette describing the intensive process of creating the magazine, cumulating in the scenes at Babylon during the final episode of season 2.2002 Queer as Folk Summer Pride Tour - a featurette following various cast members at their appearances at Pride marches in the US. Great to see the cast interacting with their fans in a positive way.The Folks - first screen has pictures of the main cast. Selecting their photo leads to a small description of the character they portray and another link to a very short interview video.*  The next screen has the supporting cast (such as Uncle Vic and Ben) with a small description of their characters, but disappointingly no video interview. The third and final page has the main producers and directors listed.Animated photo gallery - engaging and colourful animated photo gallery with a mixture of promo shots and behind the scenes snaps set to a thumping beat.Season 3 sneak peek - a small preview of season three. Doesn't contain any spoilers but makes me eager to see season 3!!!TV Spots and trailers - basically three 'advertisements'. One for a major gay friendly car manufacturer, another for Showtime and a community service announcement for HIV. Strange that no QAF-specific promos were included, but nonetheless interesting for overseas viewers who wouldn't normally see these.Queer Duck preview - one episode of the animated series on Showtime. Animation is very crude but still funny to watch - a scene queen Duck!An extraordinary effort has been made to give us a set of extras that not only entertain, but give fans an in-depth look into the cast and behind the scenes of QAF, whilst (mostly) avoiding the usual self congratulatory back slappings that normally occur on TV show DVD releases.* To access the easter egg -  on disc 6 in 'The Folks' section, select Debbie. Highlight her photo, then press the 'up' arrow on your remote to highlight her name.

725750,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B0000798EX,David Anderson,"[4, 4]","""Queer As Folk"" season two, which was aired 2001-2002, wonderfully continues where season one ended.  This brilliant show, aired on Showtime, offers a broad range of subjects that many can relate to, not just GLBT.  It explores HIV/AIDS, the aftermath of gay bashing, gay marriage, and many others.  ""Queer As Folk"" has raised many eyebrows since its first episode aired in 2000.  The amazing daringly provocative themes keeps audience watching closely to every episode and excited for the next episode.  This is one of only few shows that explores issues that many unfortunately consider taboo.  Before the beginning, only two other sitcoms have explored GLBT issues to this level of magnitude: ""Ellen"" and ""Will And Grace"".  Taking this risk earns the cast and crew tremendous respect.Every episode was written uniquely wonderful, expressing powerdrama and humor in the perfect scenes.  The series of events never lose their interesting theme.  The realisms expressed give audiences the added shock value.  Such great episodes offer a highly unforgettable entertainment experience.  It explores Justin's brave recovery from his gay bashing incident from first season's season finale, Michael and Ted discovering their dream job, a relationship revolution between Mel and Lindsay, Emmitt finding fame, Brian slightly maturing, yet still being Brian, and much more.  The chain of events lead to a compelling season finale that will surprise every viewer.The settings remain as spectacular as always.  The nightclub Babylon continues to amaze audiences with its elaborate background, sexuality, and lighting.  All other settings, including Babylon, widely express GLBT pride, expecially the diner.  The decorations and the use of color wonderfully blend with the characters' personalities and interests.  The creativity wonderfully separates the crew from other shows.""Queer As Folk"" stars Gale Howard, Hal Sparks, Scott Lowell, Peter Paige, Randy Harrison, Michelle Clunie, Thea Gill, Sharon Gless, and Robert Gant.  Gant is wondefully introduced in the mid-season.  Every actor offers a unique sense of theme for the plot and within their character.  The wide variety of personalities and habits keep every detail interesting.  The acting has clearly improved compared to the first season, especially Sparks, Paige, and Gless.The bonus edition contains some interesting articles about the show's background.  It includes the cast touring to various radio stations and gay pride parades, the construction and the secrets of Babylon, interviews with the cast, a short episode of ""Queer Duck"" (also on Showtime), a sneak peak of season three, and more.  They show how ""Queer As Folk"" has come together as well as it did.  The actors' expressed influences make audiences watch the show in a better way.""Queer As Folk"" season two is sure to keep its audiences entertained for a long time.  It remains one of the greatest GLBT pride shows on television.  Those interesting in this edition must watch season one first.  Otherwise, the events will be hard to fully understand.",5,Season Two of the Compelling Show,1083369600,"05 1, 2004",2004,3069,"['Queer', 'Folk', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'aired', '2001-2002', 'wonderfully', 'where', 'season', 'one', 'ended', 'brilliant', 'show', 'aired', 'Showtime', 'broad', 'range', 'subjects', 'many', 'can', 'relate', 'not', 'just', 'GLBT', 'HIV/AIDS', 'aftermath', 'gay', 'bashing', 'gay', 'marriage', 'many', 'others', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'raised', 'many', 'eyebrows', 'first', 'episode', 'aired', '2000', 'amazing', 'daringly', 'provocative', 'themes', 'keeps', 'audience', 'watching', 'closely', 'episode', 'excited', 'next', 'episode', 'one', 'only', 'few', 'shows', 'issues', 'many', 'unfortunately', 'consider', 'taboo', 'beginning', 'only', 'two', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'have', 'explored', 'GLBT', 'issues', 'level', 'magnitude', 'Ellen', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Taking', 'risk', 'cast', 'crew', 'tremendous', 'respect.Every', 'episode', 'was', 'written', 'uniquely', 'wonderful', 'expressing', 'powerdrama', 'humor', 'perfect', 'scenes', 'series', 'events', 'never', 'lose', 'interesting', 'theme', 'realisms', 'expressed', 'give', 'audiences', 'added', 'shock', 'value', 'Such', 'great', 'episodes', 'offer', 'highly', 'unforgettable', 'entertainment', 'experience', 'Justin', 'brave', 'recovery', 'gay', 'bashing', 'incident', 'first', 'season', 'season', 'finale', 'Michael', 'Ted', 'discovering', 'dream', 'job', 'relationship', 'revolution', 'Mel', 'Lindsay', 'Emmitt', 'finding', 'fame', 'Brian', 'slightly', 'maturing', 'yet', 'still', 'being', 'Brian', 'much', 'more', 'chain', 'events', 'lead', 'compelling', 'season', 'finale', 'will', 'surprise', 'viewer.The', 'settings', 'remain', 'as', 'spectacular', 'always', 'nightclub', 'Babylon', 'amaze', 'audiences', 'elaborate', 'background', 'sexuality', 'lighting', 'other', 'settings', 'including', 'Babylon', 'widely', 'express', 'GLBT', 'pride', 'expecially', 'diner', 'decorations', 'use', 'color', 'wonderfully', 'blend', 'characters', 'personalities', 'interests', 'creativity', 'wonderfully', 'crew', 'other', 'shows', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'Gale', 'Howard', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'Scott', 'Lowell', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'Randy', 'Harrison', 'Michelle', 'Clunie', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'Robert', 'Gant', 'Gant', 'wondefully', 'introduced', 'mid-season', 'Every', 'actor', 'unique', 'sense', 'theme', 'plot', 'character', 'wide', 'variety', 'personalities', 'habits', 'keep', 'detail', 'interesting', 'acting', 'clearly', 'improved', 'compared', 'first', 'season', 'especially', 'Sparks', 'Paige', 'Gless.The', 'bonus', 'edition', 'interesting', 'articles', 'show', 'background', 'cast', 'touring', 'various', 'radio', 'stations', 'gay', 'pride', 'parades', 'construction', 'secrets', 'Babylon', 'cast', 'short', 'episode', 'Queer', 'Duck', 'also', 'Showtime', 'sneak', 'peak', 'season', 'three', 'more', 'show', 'how', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'come', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'actors', 'expressed', 'influences', 'make', 'audiences', 'watch', 'show', 'better', 'way', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'season', 'two', 'sure', 'keep', 'audiences', 'entertained', 'long', 'time', 'one', 'greatest', 'GLBT', 'pride', 'television', 'interesting', 'edition', 'must', 'watch', 'season', 'one', 'first', 'Otherwise', 'events', 'will', 'be', 'hard', 'fully', 'understand']",N/A
725751,A6YK7TEYVSSA3,B0000798EX,DJ_Bitter,"[5, 5]","I used to have Showtime back in the early Oughts and I caught this show when it first premiered. I was floored. I was amazed at how it was both risk-taking and risque it was at the same time. But the more I watched it; the more I realized it was more about us as people than ""tehhawtgaysex11!!""  My hetero friends and family have a hard time with this show cause they are either intimidated by the explicit gay relationships or consider it softcore porn. My gay and bi friends had problems with it because they thought that it was an inaccurate portrayal of gay life. And ""Will and Grace"" is? But then, sadly, I lost Showtime and went for three years without my beloved QAF.But recently, I rediscovered the show on DVD and I thought that it was nothing short of amazing. This show still packs the intensity and the brazeness that I had so loved before. The characters had grown by leaps and bounds and became more intriguing. I especially loved the inclusion of Ben, Ethan, Leda and George. I loved that also they tackled real issues such as recovering from gay bashing, being HIV+ and the general relationship problems that we all go through.But there was still some downfalls. I hated how they handled the relationship with George. He was a very sweet old man and the way they handled it was downright crude. Also, why is it that on every show that features lesbians.

All the characters develop further with various twists and turns.I was especially pleased that Debbie, Michael's mother, starts to develop a social life of her own and that almost all the male characters are forced to make decisions on their work lives.  The US QAF realistically depicts Brian's workplace and personal career management. Brian shows he has the drive and the insight to succeed, not letting outside pressures distract him.  The segments with Emmett with an older gentleman and Justin with younger people were especially effective.  The characters get to range out more.The pacing varies over the season.  Early, while Justin is recouperating, the show drags along.  Although the writing generates longeurs from time to time, the topics are worthy and not explored much elsewhere, one of the main attractions of QAF.In the second season, the principal characters draw together more.  This was inevitable and desirable.  Still, in the first season, the camera seemed to linger longer on the outside characters appearing in sex scenes (like Brian's conquests in the men's room at work and on his office desk or like Blake, who was with Ted a while).  This year, outside characters get less attention before or during sex and are shown in a blocked glimpse-cut-blocked glimpse-cut style similar to the three-way Brian orchestrated in the first season.  The eye candy became more generic in the second season.  The audience and the main characters focus more on the main characters.Still the point of QAF is to show gays and lesbians interacting with each other and with the outside world.

I was fortunate enough to receive my copy as a gift from a very special fella, and it occupied my DVD player for a couple weeks!Living up to its reputation, ""Queer as Folk"" continues the storylines so successfully started in season 1. After recouping from his bashing, Justin struggles to find his center of control in his life, and with his relationship with hunter Brian. Michael recovers from the failed relationship with Dr. David. Ted examines his career goals, venturing into a new business more aptly suited to his ""talents"". And Lindsay and Melanie dare to dream of marriage, and the ramifications of it afterwards.Where the first season dared to break all the conventional television rules, season 2 found a bit of difficulty in starting by wrapping up the events from season 1 in the first couple of episodes. Once given room to breathe on its own, Season 2 takes off and never loses steam. New characters and plotlines generated much needed energy, creating a very satisfying season overall. I loved Emmett's storyline with new/old boyfriend George, as well as the entire comicbook storyline. Michael's new boyfriend Ben allowed the series to ""deal with"" HIV head on in a realistic manner. All allowed for new, interesting twists, and character illuminations.The DVD collection is quite good. Each episode is quality done with even a listing of all the songs that were used in the show, even ones done in the ""background"". It was a good reference in case you enjoyed hearing a song and wanted to know the artist.Overall, you can't go wrong. Hopefully ""Queer as Folk"" will be around for a long time.

725757,A3IOL528UTH7IL,B0000798EX,J. A. Stickles,"[9, 10]","For a while now, I have a new reason to look forward to Sunday night tv.  QAF is the best tv show out there, period.  I was flipping through curiously, and I stumbled upon this show roughly mid-season, of the first season.  I was totally hooked onto this show as soon as I saw the first ten minutes.  When Showtime played the entire first season before the second season, I stayed up until 4 a.m. for a week straight.  But, I refuse to base this show on the homosexual community, because I have no idea, but this show is performed beautifully.  It has the BEST all-around cast in television.  I love all of the characters, the are acted beautifully.The second season was great, the first was better, but the second was very good.  I loved how all of the relationships matured, and how all of the actors just became so enticed into their roles.  This is what I love the characters:Brian:  He grew a heart!  Believe me, I love this playboy, but it was so refreshing and heart warming to see him care for Justin the way he did.  And getting everyone to help out with Lindsey and Mel's wedding was just so great of him.  Gale Harold, whom plays Brian, is just an amazing actor, I'm sure we'll see more of him in other productions.Justin:  I love how Justin matured into an adult.  I cried during the first season's ending, it was completely gut wrenching.  You could almost feel his struggle the first few episodes, when he was in recovery.  It was hard to see him in such pain, and unwillingness to even open up to the man he loves, Brian.  Randy Harrison is a talented actor, and he puts so much depth into a character that I'm sure we all thought of as annoying as hell during the beginning of the show.Ted:  I think Ted is kind of boring to tell you the truth, but he's an excellent friend to everyone.  He cares very much, and that shows a lot.  His love for porn was given a boost with his new Internet porn business.  He seems to take very well to it.  The big reason I'm tuning in for season 3, his love for Emmett.Michael:  Oh lord, during the first season, I seriously wanted to punch him in the face, he was so whiny, and unsure of himself.  I was glad to see that he received a little more self confidence, and more sure of himself.  I was also happy to see that he wasn't as ""needy"" of Brian's affections as well.  I think his relationship with Ben (Robert Gant) is just perfect.  He needed to put focus on someone other than Brian.Debbie:  The best mom in the world.  She's understanding, loving, caring, and in your face when you need to be straightened out.  I love how she was once troubled with the relationship with Mike and Ben, and then with the help of Vic, is now excepting, and non-judgemental on the situation.  Sharon Gless is an amazing actress, and I didn't know her from her earlier works, but I'd say she's great.Lindsey and Melanie:  By far the most realistic couple of the show.  I think they're just fantastic together, I think they are one of the best couples in tv.  I love how they work with one another, and managed to get married, which was so beautiful.  I also love how the show gave them far more interaction and story lines this season.  I thoroughly enjoyed seeing them together.  Thea Gill and Michelle Clunie have beautiful chemistry.Emmett:  I'm saving the best for last.  He is my absolute favorite.  No words can describe how much I love this character.  He's flamboyant, caring, loving, understanding, and everyone's soul mate.  He's the best friend anyone could ever ask for.  He's always there for everyone, especially Ted and Michael.  He puts things into perspective that is touching and never harsh.  He's a true believer of the ""one"" and you can't help but root for him.  I was sad for him after George died, but I was proud to see him stand up for their relationship.  Peter Paige is right now, my favorite actor.  I've seen him in other productions, and he's simply one of the most talented actors out there.  I hope he continues the great work.",5,Best TV Series Out Out There!,1047427200,"03 12, 2003",2003,3998,"['while', 'now', 'have', 'new', 'reason', 'look', 'forward', 'Sunday', 'night', 'tv', 'QAF', 'best', 'tv', 'show', 'there', 'period', 'was', 'flipping', 'curiously', 'stumbled', 'show', 'roughly', 'mid-season', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'totally', 'hooked', 'show', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'When', 'Showtime', 'played', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'season', 'stayed', 'up', '4', 'a.m.', 'week', 'straight', 'refuse', 'base', 'show', 'homosexual', 'community', 'have', 'idea', 'show', 'performed', 'beautifully', 'BEST', 'all-around', 'cast', 'television', 'love', 'characters', 'are', 'acted', 'beautifully.The', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'first', 'was', 'better', 'second', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'loved', 'how', 'relationships', 'matured', 'how', 'actors', 'just', 'became', 'so', 'enticed', 'roles', 'what', 'love', 'characters', 'Brian', 'grew', 'heart', 'Believe', 'love', 'playboy', 'was', 'so', 'refreshing', 'heart', 'warming', 'see', 'care', 'Justin', 'way', 'did', 'getting', 'everyone', 'help', 'out', 'Lindsey', 'Mel', 'wedding', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'great', 'Gale', 'Harold', 'whom', 'Brian', 'just', 'amazing', 'actor', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'other', 'productions.Justin', 'love', 'how', 'Justin', 'matured', 'adult', 'cried', 'first', 'season', 'ending', 'was', 'completely', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'could', 'almost', 'feel', 'struggle', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'when', 'was', 'recovery', 'was', 'hard', 'see', 'such', 'pain', 'unwillingness', 'even', 'open', 'up', 'man', 'Brian', 'Randy', 'Harrison', 'talented', 'actor', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'character', ""'m"", 'sure', 'thought', 'as', 'annoying', 'hell', 'beginning', 'show.Ted', 'think', 'Ted', 'kind', 'boring', 'tell', 'truth', 'excellent', 'friend', 'everyone', 'very', 'much', 'lot', 'love', 'porn', 'was', 'given', 'boost', 'new', 'Internet', 'porn', 'business', 'take', 'very', 'well', 'big', 'reason', ""'m"", 'tuning', 'season', '3', 'love', 'Emmett.Michael', 'Oh', 'lord', 'first', 'season', 'seriously', 'wanted', 'punch', 'face', 'was', 'so', 'whiny', 'unsure', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'received', 'little', 'more', 'self', 'confidence', 'more', 'sure', 'was', 'also', 'happy', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'needy', 'Brian', 'affections', 'well', 'think', 'relationship', 'Ben', 'Robert', 'Gant', 'just', 'perfect', 'needed', 'put', 'focus', 'someone', 'other', 'Brian.Debbie', 'best', 'mom', 'world', 'understanding', 'loving', 'caring', 'face', 'when', 'need', 'be', 'straightened', 'out', 'love', 'how', 'was', 'once', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'Mike', 'Ben', 'then', 'help', 'Vic', 'now', 'excepting', 'non-judgemental', 'situation', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'amazing', 'actress', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'earlier', 'works', ""'d"", 'say', 'great.Lindsey', 'Melanie', 'far', 'most', 'realistic', 'couple', 'show', 'think', ""'re"", 'just', 'fantastic', 'together', 'think', 'are', 'one', 'best', 'couples', 'tv', 'love', 'how', 'work', 'one', 'managed', 'get', 'married', 'was', 'so', 'beautiful', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'show', 'gave', 'far', 'more', 'interaction', 'story', 'lines', 'season', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'together', 'Thea', 'Gill', 'Michelle', 'Clunie', 'have', 'beautiful', 'chemistry.Emmett', ""'m"", 'saving', 'best', 'last', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'words', 'can', 'describe', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'character', 'flamboyant', 'caring', 'loving', 'understanding', 'everyone', 'soul', 'mate', 'best', 'friend', 'anyone', 'could', 'ever', 'ask', 'always', 'everyone', 'especially', 'Ted', 'Michael', 'things', 'perspective', 'touching', 'never', 'harsh', 'true', 'believer', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'root', 'was', 'sad', 'George', 'died', 'was', 'proud', 'see', 'stand', 'up', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'Paige', 'right', 'now', 'favorite', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'productions', 'simply', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'actors', 'there', 'hope', 'great', 'work']",N/A

725760,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B0000798EX,Libretio,"[29, 31]","QUEER AS FOLK: Season Two(USA - 2002)Aspect ratio: 1.78:1TV soundtrack: StereoFollowing the violent assault which closed Season One, Brian (Gale Harold) takes Justin (Randy Harrison) into his home, where they develop a passionate - but open - relationship. Michael (Hal Sparks) falls in love with a hunky college professor (Robert Gant) who turns out to be HIV positive, leading to conflict with Michael's worried mom Debbie (Sharon Gless). Elsewhere, Melanie (Michelle Clunie) and Lindsay (Thea Gill) are troubled by a ghost from Mel's past, a vibrant free spirit named Leda (Nancy Anne Sakovich) who insinuates herself into their relationship in an unexpected way. Emmett (Peter Paige) falls in love with an elderly millionaire (Bruce Gray), and eternal wallflower Ted (Scott Lowell) finds success as an Internet porn baron! Then, sexy young violinist Ethan Gold (Fabrizio Filippo) enters the fray, turning Justin's head in a manner which has far-reaching consequences for all concerned...Having exhausted plotlines from the original British TV series, the second season of Showtime's ""Queer as Folk"" strives to establish its own identity, and largely succeeds on its own terms. Despite the grim storyline surrounding Justin's recovery, the tone of the series is considerably lighter this time around, with an emphasis on character-based comedy and fruity one-liners, many of which appear to have strayed from a particularly filthy 'Carry On' movie! Comedy aside, however, the writers make room for a number of important social issues, including HIV and AIDS, barebacking, pornography, and the gay community's apparent indifference following the death of a young man who was killed by a stranger he picked up in a nightclub. The emphasis on drugs which characterized the opening season has been considerably downsized, and the simmering relationship between Michael and Brian no longer dominates proceedings, while Mel and Lindsay are brought out of the shadows to take their rightful place at the forefront of the QAF ensemble (the 'wedding' episode is a joy). Performances are uniformly excellent, though Gant's character (Ben) is basically consigned to the periphery. Former model Sakovich plays Leda with genuine relish (her brief scenes with Brian are a scream), and ultra-sexy Filippo turns up the heat as a gifted but lonely musician who throws Justin's world into disarray.Overall, Season Two lacks the dramatic punch of its predecessor, and the lighter tone has led to accusations from some quarters that the show has descended into routine soap opera. Even if the criticisms were justified (and they're not), there's actually nothing wrong with 'soap opera', so long as it's done well, though Brian's stubborn refusal to acknowledge Justin's emotional needs results in a disappointing season finale, whose outcome is never in doubt. Inevitably, perhaps, it's the small moments which make the biggest impression: The profound, but unspoken, love between Brian and Lindsay whenever they're alone together; Justin listening to a CD recording of Ethan's music as he contemplates a life-changing betrayal; Michael breaking down in a hospital corridor as Ben falls prey to an opportunistic illness (Hal Sparks' distress in this scene is achingly realistic).

I really did NOT think I would like the show at all (too many stereotypes, too much drug use, too much casual sex) .. and while the show HAD all of those stereotypes, it reminded me that they were only parts of what were real, well-developed characters.  It's also become even clearer in season two that the show is not about sex, it's not about drugs, and it's not about gay stereotypes.  In my mind, it's about the journey that comes from wading through all of the above and finding a sense of individuality and happiness in the gay world.By the time I got to the end of Season One, I couldn't wait for Season Two to become available on DVD (I don't have Showtime). Well, it doesn't disappoint. While some of the story lines are a bit contrived (Emmett and the billionnaire, Ted's overnight website success, etc) the writers and producers of the show have put together another cohesive, well-written batch of 20+ episodes.I may just have to put out the money to order Showtime, because I'm not sure I can wait another full year before Season 3 is available.

Here comes season two, which is just as strong, but more watchable as we don't have to deal with necessary explanations and are able to get into the drama easily, since we care so much for these characters.And what a drama it is! After the shocking season finale of the first season (the best season finale I've ever seen, and the one that made jump out of my seat and ring a friend so we could discuss it), we find our favorite TV ""family"" dealing with various issues of acceptance, stereotypes, life and death. Justin (Randy Harrison) and Brian (Gale Harold), around who the first season centered, are in the spotlight again, with Justin dealing with the shock and trauma of his past experiences, and Brian basically just trying to ignore the fact how much their relationship has developed and how much he cares for that kid. Jealousy grows, especially after Justin's questionable career choice. Emmett also gets a shocking job, and a bigger role, which leads to a new relationship, heartbreak and genuine drama. As for Michael (Hal Sparks), the ""narrator"" of the show and the character off whom all the problems bounce off finds a new boyfriend Ben (newcomer Robert Gant) and needs to deal with his own issues that develop in their relationship. Ted (Scott Lowell) keeps being somewhat of a marginal character, although the last couple of episodes provide him with a chance to not only deliver a strong performance, but also take part in some highly unexpected and entertaining plot developments. Michelle Clunie and Thea Gill who play the lesbian couple Melanie and Lindsay provide shoulders to cry on, but still deal with their own personal struggles, especially when Melanie's old friend decides to drop by.The second season of ""Queer as Folk"" is everything you could have expected it to be. The show has evolved from being a controversial soap-opera, and it now has a life of its own. The direction is always strong and inventive, performances are stellar (especially that of Randy Harrison) and the soundtrack is pitch-perfect (Queer as Folk: The Second Season).

This New Queer As Folk Season 2 DVD Box Set has all 20 episodes of the second season of one of the most controversial and bravest series on television today. The BOX SET includes Bonus features such as: behind the scenes outtakes, deleted scenes, special edition episodes, a Photo Gallery, DVD rom extras, and much more. Queer As Folk shows the life of a group of gay guys and a lesbian couple living in Pittsburgh. I feel the first season of QUEER AS FOLK is better, but this second season is very good as well and shows the growth of the characters. I have seen all 20 episodes of Season 2 and it is slower paced than the first season, and I sometimes find myself looking at my watch which rarely ever happened with season 1. I am still amazed at how honest this show is on dealing with gay life. Queer As Folk makes no apologies and thats what is so great about this series. From the graphic sex scenes to the drama of dealing with the prejudice that still haunts America, this show is so brave and I give Showtime a big thumbs up for having the balls to take on such a big risk as Queer As Folk. This show is as close as it gets to real life. This is not a show just for gay people, but for ALL people. It deals with human emotion and thats something we can all relate to whether we be straight, gay, bisexual, black, white, brown or in between. I have since signed up for Showtime just for this show. I encourage anyone who has a open mind and a open heart to BUY this amazing DVD collection as it will inspire you and if nothing else open your mind to a lifestyle not as uncommon as you may think.

725774,A2AFM0SLLFPSJ1,B0000798EX,"Savant11 ""Savant11""","[55, 62]","Yes QAF is unique because it is a gay ensemble show but what really makes it unique is the intelligence, its wit and its' true to life form. As far as I am concerned QAF is a remedy to all the nighttime ensemble soaps that are and were on TV.  It has a wit that only those sextarians on Friends could only dream of. There is none of the unrealistic pretentious dialogue that riddles Dawsons Creek (whose teenagers speak like PHD candidates). It has achieved the slice of life that Melrose Place originally aimed for but never achieved. It has an earthiness that Beveryly Hills 90210 could never reach for.  QAF is one out of my 3 favorite shows currently on TV.I have to admit that season 2 was not quite as good as season 1.  It seems as if for the first half of the season they tried to make it light (a la Friends). But most of the time I found that it  fell very flat. I guess that the creators found that  QAF- light was not working and they shifted back to being serious mid season.Also this season was way too slow and drawn out. It lacked the frenetic pace of season one. And many of the storylines could have been summed up in two episodes.  Namely Brian and Justin's relationship which did not have to take 20 episodes to come to its inevitable conclusion.  But besides that I still love the way that QAF tackle the issues of life in a very realistic way. Not in a wishful thinking kind of way. But in a way that says this is life.Some of the highlights from this season.:Lindsay (let's all get along) finally standing up to her parents.  I loved the way the scene was handled. Many other creators would have used the Bull in the China shop method by making Lindsay's reaction to her parents flippant. But instead you could really see that she was really  torn up inside and that her heart was breaking. That scene showed me was no matter how old we become we all deep inside crave the approval of our parents. It's a feeling that never goes away.Another true to life episode was when Brian's company was being bought out and he was being given a week to show his new boss why he shouldn't be canned.  Instead of having Brian tell off his new boss (which you would think fitting with his arrogant nature). Brian works hard to salvage his career. It goes to show that even Brian is practical enough to know that paying the bills comes far above personal ego.  One of the things I adore about this show is the character Brian Kinney. Oh yes he can be a SOB but I just love his level of confidence. It is just simply amazing to watch him operate.  Like it or not its' people like this with this level of confidence about them that make it to the top in the business world.There was another scene where Justin is saying some ugly things about his mother and Brian tells him to shut up. And that he should be grateful for having a mother who cares.This season there is a new romance for Michael. Played by an openly gay actor by the name of Robert Gant. Ironically there is very little chemistry between him and Hal Sparks (Michael). I really found Gants' acting to be flat and uninspiring,( I guess that it was no surprise to find out that he was originally a lawyer) Chris Potter's performance (David from Season 1) was much much better.Emmetts romance with an older man, was really beautiful. Emmette  has often proved to be the comic relief of the show, but it was really sweet and delightful to watch him bring out a spark in this older man.Of course there was the wedding.  Which could have been made into a political diatribe, but wasn't. It was just a beautiful ceremony between two people.  One of the chief things I have envied about this show is the relationship between the seven principle characters. They are like a family and I don't  think that this is all simply due to the fact that they are gay.  Because of the way people move around we are often very far from our blood relatives and have to connect or make a new family with those around us.But in all I still think that QAF is far more superior show than most of what is out  on TV. Thank you Cowlip productions for not going the cliched political  correct way and making my TV viewing worth while!",5,Give Me More!,1030924800,"09 2, 2002",2002,4176,"['Yes', 'QAF', 'unique', 'gay', 'ensemble', 'show', 'what', 'really', 'unique', 'intelligence', 'wit', 'true', 'life', 'form', 'As', 'far', 'am', 'concerned', 'QAF', 'remedy', 'nighttime', 'ensemble', 'soaps', 'are', 'were', 'TV', 'wit', 'only', 'sextarians', 'Friends', 'could', 'only', 'dream', 'none', 'unrealistic', 'pretentious', 'dialogue', 'Dawsons', 'Creek', 'teenagers', 'speak', 'PHD', 'candidates', 'achieved', 'slice', 'life', 'Melrose', 'Place', 'originally', 'aimed', 'never', 'achieved', 'earthiness', 'Beveryly', '90210', 'could', 'never', 'reach', 'QAF', 'one', 'out', '3', 'favorite', 'shows', 'currently', 'TV.I', 'have', 'admit', 'season', '2', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'season', '1', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'tried', 'make', 'light', 'la', 'Friends', 'most', 'time', 'found', 'fell', 'very', 'flat', 'guess', 'creators', 'found', 'QAF-', 'light', 'was', 'not', 'working', 'shifted', 'back', 'being', 'serious', 'mid', 'season.Also', 'season', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'slow', 'drawn', 'out', 'lacked', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'season', 'one', 'many', 'storylines', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'summed', 'up', 'two', 'episodes', 'Namely', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'relationship', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'take', '20', 'episodes', 'come', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'still', 'love', 'way', 'QAF', 'tackle', 'issues', 'life', 'very', 'realistic', 'way', 'Not', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'kind', 'way', 'way', 'life.Some', 'highlights', 'season', 'Lindsay', 'let', 'get', 'along', 'finally', 'standing', 'up', 'parents', 'loved', 'way', 'scene', 'was', 'handled', 'Many', 'other', 'creators', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'Bull', 'China', 'shop', 'method', 'making', 'Lindsay', 'reaction', 'parents', 'flippant', 'instead', 'could', 'really', 'see', 'was', 'really', 'torn', 'up', 'inside', 'heart', 'was', 'breaking', 'scene', 'showed', 'was', 'matter', 'how', 'old', 'become', 'deep', 'inside', 'crave', 'approval', 'parents', 'feeling', 'never', 'away.Another', 'true', 'life', 'episode', 'was', 'when', 'Brian', 'company', 'was', 'being', 'bought', 'out', 'was', 'being', 'given', 'week', 'show', 'new', 'boss', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'canned', 'Instead', 'having', 'Brian', 'tell', 'off', 'new', 'boss', 'would', 'think', 'fitting', 'arrogant', 'nature', 'Brian', 'hard', 'salvage', 'career', 'show', 'even', 'Brian', 'practical', 'enough', 'know', 'paying', 'bills', 'far', 'above', 'personal', 'ego', 'One', 'things', 'adore', 'show', 'character', 'Brian', 'Kinney', 'Oh', 'can', 'be', 'SOB', 'just', 'love', 'level', 'confidence', 'just', 'simply', 'amazing', 'watch', 'operate', 'not', 'people', 'level', 'confidence', 'make', 'top', 'business', 'world.There', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Justin', 'saying', 'ugly', 'things', 'mother', 'Brian', 'shut', 'up', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'having', 'mother', 'who', 'cares.This', 'season', 'new', 'romance', 'Michael', 'Played', 'openly', 'gay', 'actor', 'name', 'Robert', 'Gant', 'Ironically', 'very', 'little', 'chemistry', 'Hal', 'Sparks', 'Michael', 'really', 'found', 'Gants', 'acting', 'be', 'flat', 'uninspiring', 'guess', 'was', 'surprise', 'find', 'out', 'was', 'originally', 'lawyer', 'Chris', 'Potter', 'performance', 'David', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'much', 'much', 'better.Emmetts', 'romance', 'older', 'man', 'was', 'really', 'beautiful', 'Emmette', 'often', 'proved', 'be', 'comic', 'relief', 'show', 'was', 'really', 'sweet', 'delightful', 'watch', 'bring', 'out', 'spark', 'older', 'man.Of', 'course', 'was', 'wedding', 'Which', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'political', 'diatribe', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'just', 'beautiful', 'ceremony', 'two', 'people', 'One', 'chief', 'things', 'have', 'envied', 'show', 'relationship', 'seven', 'principle', 'characters', 'are', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'simply', 'due', 'fact', 'are', 'gay', 'way', 'people', 'move', 'are', 'often', 'very', 'far', 'blood', 'relatives', 'have', 'connect', 'make', 'new', 'family', 'us.But', 'still', 'think', 'QAF', 'far', 'more', 'superior', 'show', 'most', 'what', 'out', 'TV', 'Thank', 'Cowlip', 'productions', 'not', 'going', 'cliched', 'political', 'correct', 'way', 'making', 'TV', 'viewing', 'worth']",N/A
