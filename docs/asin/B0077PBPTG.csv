1527734,A24PTVSZSM8968,B0077PBPTG,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","I ordered this movie because it got such good reviews. Aside from the typical shortcomings that you find with a television movie, I really liked this film.  With the glut of reality shows nowadays, the setting and theme for the movie is much less than original. It centers around a movie star whose career is in a rut and who agrees to do a reality show to find a wife in order to bolster his image. The movie does a pretty good job of recreating the tackiness of a reality show. The romantic aspect comes from the fact that the leading contestant falls in love with the movie star's manager along the way. The movie has a bit of a surprise twist at the end that really fits the reality show aspect of the whole thing. The two characters that fall in love have some decent chemistry in the film which makes it easy to watch. The only complaint that I have about the movie is the setting. It is supposed to have taken place in L.A., but was obviously filmed mostly in Canada. The producers tried to cover up the wrong setting with lots of close-in shots, interior shots and backgrounds with washed out lighting. In spite of that, there isn't one scene in the movie that looks even remotely like the place it is supposed to be set. Most of the characters wear winter jackets when outside which doesn't help either. I would have preferred that the movie just be set in Canada. I think it would have been more convincing and added to the charm of the film. In any case, that's a fairly small complaint about a film that's pretty good.",4,Hits a lot of the right marks,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,1530,"['ordered', 'movie', 'got', 'such', 'good', 'reviews', 'Aside', 'typical', 'shortcomings', 'find', 'television', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'glut', 'reality', 'shows', 'nowadays', 'setting', 'theme', 'movie', 'much', 'less', 'original', 'movie', 'star', 'career', 'rut', 'who', 'do', 'reality', 'show', 'find', 'wife', 'order', 'bolster', 'image', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'recreating', 'tackiness', 'reality', 'show', 'romantic', 'aspect', 'fact', 'leading', 'contestant', 'love', 'movie', 'star', 'manager', 'way', 'movie', 'bit', 'surprise', 'twist', 'end', 'really', 'reality', 'show', 'aspect', 'whole', 'thing', 'two', 'characters', 'fall', 'love', 'have', 'decent', 'chemistry', 'film', 'easy', 'watch', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'movie', 'setting', 'supposed', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'L.A.', 'was', 'obviously', 'filmed', 'mostly', 'Canada', 'producers', 'tried', 'cover', 'up', 'wrong', 'setting', 'lots', 'close-in', 'shots', 'interior', 'shots', 'backgrounds', 'washed', 'out', 'lighting', 'spite', ""n't"", 'one', 'scene', 'movie', 'even', 'remotely', 'place', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', 'Most', 'characters', 'wear', 'winter', 'jackets', 'when', 'outside', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'movie', 'just', 'be', 'set', 'Canada', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'convincing', 'added', 'charm', 'film', 'case', 'fairly', 'small', 'complaint', 'film', 'pretty', 'good']",N/A

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and was surprised by the ending. However, when I viewed the original movie after I ordered it online I was surprised (yet in reality should not have been) that there were a couple of scenes that had been deleted from Hallmark's airing. I understand why Hallmark deleted them since they adhere to family-oriented standards (which is why I appreciate them). But in retrospect, the fact that it was originally made for ABC's Family channel, I am not at all surprised by those scenes. ABC Family channel's definition of family-friendly is clearly different from mine. Some may disagree with me but that's okay. I just did not expect to see the couple of scenes that were deleted from Hallmark's airing of the movie. While I wasn't offended I was disappointed because I thought I was buying exactly what was aired. That said, it didn't have any R rated scenes but some dialogue and insinuations were inappropriate for what I would consider a ""family-friendly"" movie. Thus the reason for my 4 stars.

This is also a bit of a TV movie version of the big screen film ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton"" except more charming.  Bradley Cooper is Todd, Ryan's best friend, who comes up with the idea of reviving his pal's movie career with a Bachelor-like show. During the selection process, Todd vets the candidates, and makes a connection with the reluctant fellow hometown girl Charlie from Boston. Charlie never actually applied to be on the show because her sister and brother-in-law decided to play matchmakers and submit her without her knowledge. Early on, producers and Todd, decide she is ""the one"" who will bring back Ryan's star power with an image overhaul. Ryan, usually the ladies man, is finding it harder to charm the witty Charlie. Charlie likes good literary books, crossword puzzles, and isn't all that starstruck with Ryan compared to the other contestants. Since Todd has always had more success with women like Charlie (according to Ryan) he gets coaching from his best friend who speaks the right lines to Ryan via an ear piece. Just like Cyrano, it's Todd's words that win over Charlie, and the rest of the audience. Everyone wants Ryan to pick Charlie, which would make Todd being in Ryan's shadow once again. Luckily, Charlie has more substance than the rest of the contestants and realizes that Todd is the one with all the right lines. The only problem is, for the first time in a long while, Todd is going to have to choose his happiness over Ryan's and the rest of the viewers voting for Ryan to marry Charlie.",5,A hidden Bradley Cooper Gem!
