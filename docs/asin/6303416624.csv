I'm always amazed and intrigued when I read such mixed reviews about a film.I had no idea until now that this came out the same year as ""Natural Born Killers,"" but while I watched it I was reminded of the same satiric, brutal, over-the-top portrayal of the hype that fuels a media frenzy. If that type of movie offends or disappoints you, S.F.W. will probably probably have the same effect.The story was purposefully exaggerated and for the most part darkly comical, but it was also violent and raw. Besides being thoroughly entertained, I was reminded why I have no desire to be famous - not even for 15 minutes. I'd rather be invisible than have my life examined under a microscope and judged by people who form their perception of me based on what they have been led to believe or by something I've done at a certain point that doesn't represent who I really am as a person. Then again, that's often what happens in reality.Obviously there are countless individuals who have adopted the ""So F___ing What"" attitude throughout history.

While genuinely endearing movies languish in studio vaults, dry rotting and forgotten, films like SFW (and you really do understand the title, right?) ride the wave of acclaim and fond regard, and personally I have no idea why. This story of the aftermath in the lives of suddenly famous teens whose entire month-long ordeal of being held hostage in a convenience store is broadcast live before the world might be suitable for a short sketch or a brief student film, but to stretch it out to feature length and say it has artistic merit...? No. Not buying it. Of course it does feature Stephen Dorff and a pre-A list Reese Witherspoon, so maybe that's a clue as to why it's still fondly referred to today not only by those who sat through it in a decade ago but by those coming of age in this decade, long after the time when by all sanity it should be a '90's artifact.

Coignard,"[11, 26]","I really thought this was pretty lame movie, and in NO way a comparrison to Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction the way one reviewer described.  The attempt is to tell a story about some kid, played by Stephen Dorff, who becomes a pop-culture icon because he was held hostage and apparently didn't care.  At least thats what I got out of it.  I think what turned me off the most about this movie was Dorff's character--an ""uber-cool"" rebel type who's mean to his apparently oppresive father and cry-baby of a mother, slam dances and tears up his room (I guess to prove to us how cool he is), and who can get in front of an audience of high school kids and proudly cuss for no other reason then he'll know it'll get laughs.  In real life someone like that would be considered a slacker or an (...), but for the case of this movie I guess he's cool.  Anyway, my problems with the character aside, this movie just wasn't that good to begin with.  A REALLY weak script, and I swear each of these leading actors could have, and have done, about ten times better since, so I wonder why the only put in half the effort for this one.  Maybe they knew it wasn't going anywhere and needed the paycheck.  As cool and revolutionary it tries to be, S.F.W. doesn't really do anything all that spectacular. The gun battle at the end with the terrorists, as well as the movie's protrayal of the media are the best (and really only good) things about this movie.  But, most of you kiddies out there will probably like it because it has people cussing and drinking beer.

I had to state that first because that's just what this film is about. SFW peels back the layers of psychology to ask why people feel the need to follow or worship something as a group continuem. The film was ahead of its time upon release but it sure did foreshadow what was to come. If you look at culture today we as a society make celebrities out of anyone who does an outlandish act or simply associates with celebrities. Look at modern tv for example with shows like Jersey Shore and The Real Housewives series, celebrity worship is at an all time high, but did you ever ask yourself why are these people becoming celebrities or famous? I believe in today's age if you were to take anyone off the streets and clean them up. Put them in trendy clothes and plant them all over the television for a period of time, they would become famous for basically having achieved nothing. The movie does a very good job of showing what the media does and how easily they do it. Fame is a hard thing and often hard to deal with. Society along with the media love to build someone up just to watch them fall only to see if they can get better again. We have seen this with Britney Spears, Lindsey Lohan,and Robert Downey Jr and these are people with true talent. Unfortunetly some don't make it through like Corey Haim (RIP).

Stephen Dorff stars as Cliff Spab a onetime burger boy who finds himself thrust into the media spotlight after being taken hostage by a group of terrorists dubbed The Split Image. Spab was just going to get a sixer but found himself tied to a chair along with his best friend (Jack Noseworthy) and a cute blonde named Wendy (Reese Witherspoon). Spab becomes the group spokesman spouting such inspirational codas as ""So F'ing what. Everything is nothing and doesn't mean anything"". The media seize on the opportunity to turn him into an instant celeb and soon Spab's face is everywhere from T-shirts to CD covers. He's also broadcast 24-7 on every T.V. station. Spab finds it impossible to enjoy any kind of normal life since he's become so famous and all his friends want something from him. I agree with some reviewers who say the film is ahead of it's time but I also say it's all in the delivery. All of the characters, most of all Spab, are so tasteless and annoying. Witherspoon appears too young and naive to come down on her hard. Jake Busey is kind of entertaining as one of Spab's crazy friends but the best bits of casting are Joey Lauren Adams and Natasha Gregson Wagner. Adams is super cute and has about three seconds of nudity in the film. Gregson Wagner plays a Spab follower who doesn't go as far with her idol as Adams does.
