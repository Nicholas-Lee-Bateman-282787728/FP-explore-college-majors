988437,A3Q8O09NWKG3XT,B000FDFKH0,Andrew M. Wolf,"[2, 2]","2LDK-2LDK was my second favorite of the collection.  It's comic, twisted, and entertaining.  The only drawback was that its runtime is about an hour... which is alright, a quick film, but it left me wanting more.  You get to know the characters, with a little back-story that unfolds, and though it is kept to what is ""necessary"" to the story, there is a lot more that they could have covered, easily pushing the length... but it's a good one to plug in and just enjoy.  The characters, while being completely psychotic, are both lovable and repulsing in aspects.  There is also a nice cautionary message to it, so with 2LDK, you're in for a treat.Moon Child--This one is the prize at the bottom.  Personally, I didn't really like it; I sat through it, and doubt I will again unless it is with friends and we're only half paying attention...  Compared to the other films in this set, this is very long; twice the length of 2LDK and it drags... very much.  Perhaps, the time that they could have spent expanding 2LDK cosmically transferred itself here, cutting one short and the other much too long.  Easily, the story could have been condensed, but we love looking at our pop idols!  So I guess that's okay.  The story was interesting, but there wasn't too much played on the vampire thing, it was much more of a ""family epic"" style film about a group of friends...  Also, don't let the commercials fool you, there isn't too much action in this one, and I'm pretty sure they used all the scenes in the advertisement... so when I say this is like a family epic, I mean: talking, dialogue, chatter, and a few exciting scenes in-between.  I don't mean to say this is a bad movie, just slow, but there is still quite a bit to think about in it, and I think if you take the time to watch it, not necessarily enjoy it, but watch it, you'll take something from it.Suicide Club---And for the one everyone has been waiting for, and probably the main motivation for buying the set.  Unfortunately this does not come with any extras, because there doesn't seem to be a Region 1 releasing with extras... or any that I've found... but that doesn't subtract from an excellent film!  Suicide Club is one of my all time favorite movies, and it tries to do a lot, which is where some of the criticism comes in... The movie is scattered, patchy, but on a second watch, evens the first, things come together, and they do make sense.  The movie asks a lot of question, mostly on society that is not specific to just Japanese culture, but capitalism in general... A LOT to think about.  Also, if you do like this, there is a sequel, and in time, there is an expected third installment.  Yes, this movie has a considerable amount of gore and violence, but don't let that distract you from the very, very brilliant thing that Sion Sono is trying to do!Overall----So this is a great investment if you're interested in all three films, and even if you're just interested in two, you'll find the third to be a nice bonus.  All of the films are quite different from one another, attempting to examine three different aspects, but interest in one may lead to disappointment in the other two... The price is right, though, and it's a pretty good deal for an adventurous film goer, and it doesn't look bad as an addition to your movie shelf.  Personally, I'd say it's a great collection, and definitely worth the buy!",5,Action Grab Bag: 2 goodies and the prize at the bottom,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,3387,"['2LDK-2LDK', 'was', 'second', 'favorite', 'collection', 'comic', 'twisted', 'entertaining', 'only', 'drawback', 'was', 'runtime', 'hour', 'alright', 'quick', 'film', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'little', 'back-story', 'unfolds', 'kept', 'what', 'necessary', 'story', 'lot', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'covered', 'easily', 'pushing', 'length', 'good', 'one', 'plug', 'just', 'enjoy', 'characters', 'being', 'completely', 'psychotic', 'are', 'lovable', 'repulsing', 'aspects', 'also', 'nice', 'cautionary', 'message', 'so', '2LDK', ""'re"", 'treat.Moon', 'Child', 'one', 'prize', 'bottom', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'sat', 'doubt', 'will', 'again', 'friends', ""'re"", 'only', 'half', 'paying', 'attention', 'Compared', 'other', 'films', 'set', 'very', 'long', 'twice', 'length', '2LDK', 'very', 'much', 'Perhaps', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'expanding', '2LDK', 'cosmically', 'transferred', 'here', 'cutting', 'one', 'short', 'other', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'Easily', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'condensed', 'love', 'looking', 'pop', 'So', 'guess', 'okay', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'played', 'vampire', 'thing', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'family', 'epic', 'style', 'film', 'group', 'friends', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'commercials', 'fool', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'action', 'one', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'used', 'scenes', 'advertisement', 'so', 'when', 'say', 'family', 'epic', 'mean', 'talking', 'dialogue', 'chatter', 'few', 'exciting', 'scenes', 'in-between', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'say', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'slow', 'still', 'quite', 'bit', 'think', 'think', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'not', 'necessarily', 'enjoy', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'take', 'something', 'it.Suicide', 'Club', '-And', 'one', 'everyone', 'been', 'waiting', 'probably', 'main', 'motivation', 'buying', 'set', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'come', 'extras', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'Region', '1', 'releasing', 'extras', ""'ve"", 'found', ""n't"", 'subtract', 'excellent', 'film', 'Suicide', 'Club', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'do', 'lot', 'where', 'criticism', 'movie', 'scattered', 'patchy', 'second', 'watch', 'first', 'things', 'come', 'together', 'do', 'make', 'sense', 'movie', 'lot', 'question', 'mostly', 'society', 'not', 'specific', 'just', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'capitalism', 'general', 'LOT', 'think', 'Also', 'do', 'sequel', 'time', 'expected', 'third', 'installment', 'Yes', 'movie', 'considerable', 'amount', 'gore', 'violence', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'distract', 'very', 'very', 'brilliant', 'thing', 'Sion', 'Sono', 'trying', 'do', 'Overall', 'great', 'investment', ""'re"", 'interested', 'three', 'films', 'even', ""'re"", 'just', 'interested', 'two', ""'ll"", 'find', 'third', 'be', 'nice', 'bonus', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'one', 'attempting', 'examine', 'three', 'different', 'aspects', 'interest', 'one', 'may', 'lead', 'disappointment', 'other', 'two', 'price', 'right', 'though', 'pretty', 'good', 'deal', 'adventurous', 'film', 'goer', ""n't"", 'look', 'bad', 'addition', 'movie', 'shelf', 'Personally', ""'d"", 'say', 'great', 'collection', 'definitely', 'buy']",Danger After Dark Collection (Suicide Club/ Moon Child/ 2LDK)
988438,A3EXW4HNYX7HF5,B000FDFKH0,"Atomic Tofu ""Code of Bushido""","[9, 13]","I'm rating this as an overall ""bang for your buck"" type of thing.I'll start with Suicide Club.The movie has got a lot going for it.  Great suspense, buildup and twist.  It does a good job of bringing a lot of tension in the viewer trying to figure out on their own what is happening, but to me takes a turn into nonsense because of who they are saying is causing these acts.  I don't like to spoil for anyone so my words are well-crafted I think.  The movie is good up to the point of this ingredient, it then becomes silly.  Had they taken a different route it would have been thoroughly enjoyable, but as it is, only about 65% so.Moon Child.It's not bad.  I think the movie tries to ride on these popstars Hyde and Gackt more than the story itself.  Eventhough I like jpop, I know very little of these 2 guys.  Take a look at my pic...I think I'm ""cuter"", lol.  So, that said.  The story is interesting and has a lot to go for it.  It deals with difficult choices individuals have to make and rides on ""good and bad"" or yin and yang fairly well.  Keep that in mind, yin and yang.  It's more that than the black and white good and evil.  A little bit too low budget.  I think if it was kicked up a notch it would have been much better.Last, I rate 2ldk.Out of the 3 I believe this is the best.  Of the 2 stars, I recognize Eiko Koike.  I'm one of those that picks up on details.  I recognized her from her voice alone...so after this if you haven't yet, go watch Kamikaze Girls.  She has a small role in that.Eventhough the basis of this story is the most outrageous, vampires and suicide clubs aside, it's all about the premise.  It's not ""urban legend/myth"" like Suicide club and it's not sci fi vampire stuff ike Moon child, but it's more tangible...plausible.2 roomates, that not only have to live together, but do so with the fact they are complete oppposites...and if that wasn't enough, they have to compete for something that is very dear to them.  A dream to become an actor.  Throughout it all, you witness them acting within their own world, facades and all.  It's quite interesting and very intense.Buy the pack, you won't be disappointed.",4,GOOD!,1153612800,"07 23, 2006",2006,2152,"[""'m"", 'rating', 'overall', 'bang', 'buck', 'type', 'thing.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'Suicide', 'Club.The', 'movie', 'got', 'lot', 'going', 'Great', 'suspense', 'buildup', 'twist', 'good', 'job', 'bringing', 'lot', 'tension', 'viewer', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'own', 'what', 'happening', 'turn', 'nonsense', 'who', 'are', 'saying', 'causing', 'acts', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'spoil', 'anyone', 'so', 'words', 'are', 'well-crafted', 'think', 'movie', 'good', 'up', 'point', 'ingredient', 'then', 'silly', 'Had', 'taken', 'different', 'route', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'only', 'about', '65', '%', 'so.Moon', 'Child.It', 'not', 'bad', 'think', 'movie', 'ride', 'popstars', 'Hyde', 'Gackt', 'more', 'story', 'like', 'jpop', 'know', 'very', 'little', '2', 'guys', 'Take', 'look', 'pic', 'think', ""'m"", 'cuter', 'lol', 'So', 'said', 'story', 'interesting', 'lot', 'go', 'difficult', 'choices', 'individuals', 'have', 'make', 'rides', 'good', 'bad', 'yin', 'yang', 'fairly', 'well', 'Keep', 'mind', 'yin', 'yang', 'more', 'black', 'white', 'good', 'evil', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'low', 'budget', 'think', 'was', 'kicked', 'up', 'notch', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better.Last', 'rate', '2ldk.Out', '3', 'believe', 'best', '2', 'stars', 'recognize', 'Eiko', 'Koike', ""'m"", 'one', 'up', 'details', 'recognized', 'voice', 'alone', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'go', 'watch', 'Kamikaze', 'Girls', 'small', 'role', 'basis', 'story', 'most', 'outrageous', 'vampires', 'suicide', 'clubs', 'aside', 'premise', 'not', 'urban', 'legend/myth', 'Suicide', 'club', 'not', 'sci', 'fi', 'vampire', 'stuff', 'ike', 'Moon', 'child', 'more', 'tangible', 'plausible.2', 'roomates', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'live', 'together', 'do', 'so', 'fact', 'are', 'complete', 'oppposites', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'have', 'compete', 'something', 'very', 'dear', 'dream', 'become', 'actor', 'witness', 'acting', 'own', 'world', 'facades', 'quite', 'interesting', 'very', 'intense.Buy', 'pack', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Danger After Dark Collection (Suicide Club/ Moon Child/ 2LDK)

First I watched ""Moon Child"". It's a vampire flick and it was a bit limp and I was kinda in a hurry for it to end so I can get to the next movie. Then I watched ""2LDK"". A huge step up from the previous movie and it was entertaining. Those roomates have issues. Last and the best was ""Suicide Club"". I've heard good things about it so my curiosity was peaked. It had some really creapy moments with all those skin rolls but I liked it very much. I watch alot of anime so I was prepared for the strangeness of Japanese movie philosophy. Mabey it's just strange to me. After what happened with ""Fight Club"", I dont think a Hollywood version of ""Suicide Club"" will ever see the light of day. Shame. I do have a problem with the bad guys in the movie. That was just weird. I have to admit, the Japanese are still the undisputed masters of horror. The closest thing, to really good horror, I have seen that can seriously compete was ""The Strangers"", and ""The Descent""!",3,Not bad!,1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,1099,"['Fortunatly', 'watched', '3', 'flicks', 'proper', 'order', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Japanese', 'film', 'makers', 'were', 'trying', 'portray', 'First', 'watched', 'Moon', 'Child', 'vampire', 'flick', 'was', 'bit', 'limp', 'was', 'kinda', 'hurry', 'end', 'so', 'can', 'get', 'next', 'movie', 'Then', 'watched', '2LDK', 'huge', 'step', 'up', 'previous', 'movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'roomates', 'have', 'issues', 'Last', 'best', 'was', 'Suicide', 'Club', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'good', 'things', 'so', 'curiosity', 'was', 'peaked', 'had', 'really', 'creapy', 'moments', 'skin', 'rolls', 'liked', 'very', 'much', 'watch', 'alot', 'anime', 'was', 'prepared', 'strangeness', 'Japanese', 'movie', 'philosophy', 'Mabey', 'just', 'strange', 'what', 'happened', 'Fight', 'Club', 'dont', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'Suicide', 'Club', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'Shame', 'do', 'have', 'problem', 'bad', 'guys', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'weird', 'have', 'admit', 'Japanese', 'are', 'still', 'undisputed', 'masters', 'horror', 'closest', 'thing', 'really', 'good', 'horror', 'have', 'seen', 'can', 'seriously', 'compete', 'was', 'Strangers', 'Descent']",Danger After Dark Collection (Suicide Club/ Moon Child/ 2LDK)

My favorite would definately be Suicide Club, and then Moon Child.Suicide Club wasn't ""strange"" for me at all because i researched some of it before i watched it. Therefore i understood things that most people would consider as ""grotesque"" or ""weird.""Moon Child i watched purely in ""Yaoi fangirl"" mode. Although, i do see the movie having somewhat bad acting in certain parts BUT still a great movie overall. BL fangirls or Yaoi fangirls would love this movie! So would any other person. (^.^)2LDK...I watched this movie last because i was expecting it to be the most bloody. Yet, to my dismay, there wasn't any blood (like SC) until the last 5 or so minutes. To me, and American, i laughed at many things...such as how the japanese define ""catfight"" when normally here, in America, a catfight is an all-out-brawl with ripping of the hair, etc.Suicide Club and 2LDK are movies that provoke your mind to twist in ways it never has before. Moon Child is sheer bliss and BL love.Definately worth 26 bucks because Moon Child is 16 (or so) bucks on it's own...Worth EVERY CENT! ^.^ Even if you don't like one of the movies you'll be paying the price of a new DVD release anyway!
