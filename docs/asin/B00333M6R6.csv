1319714,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00333M6R6,Grady Harp,"[3, 4]","Writer/Director Noah Buschel is a name we will likely recognize more as audiences who missed the theater release of this very quiet moody piece discover it on DVD.  In many way this story and cinematic recreation of the story reminds us of the old dark Bogart mysteries - in tone of telling, in filming gestures, and in the casting.  It is a true 'film noir' revealed slowly and insidiously in tones of umber, gray, and washed out colors so prevalent in the early color films and so additive to this production.  For this viewer it works on every level.Private Detective John Rosow (Michael Shannon in a brilliantly understated performance) is a down and out, alcoholic, internalized and bruised man who is hired to shadow a man from Chicago to Los Angeles.  Rosow seems to be easily manipulated by his 'boss' Gus (Papitos) and sidekick Charley (Amy Ryan), but when Rosow reaches Los Angeles he discovers that the man he is trailing - Harold Fulmer (Frank Wood) - is delivering a young Mexican boy to one Don Edgar (Yul Vasquez) who seems to be running an orphanage for lost kids to either sell to adopting parents or manipulate otherwise.  He is sidetracked by an agent Lana Cobb (Margaret Colin) but with the help of a taxi driver Hero (John Ventimiglia) he finally finds his targeted Harold who insists that he is a lost man, a man who only wants to remain missing to help people like the young Mexican who was an unwanted boy to find some degree of happiness.  Rosow reports his findings, and surprisingly is told that Harold wife Megan (Linda Emond) will pay a huge sum of money just to retrieve her missing husband.  It seems Harold has been missing since 9/11, but instead of dying in that explosion Harold escaped and decided the world needed help- the only way he felt he could deliver it was to leave behind his wealthy wife and lifestyle and simply do good, anonymous deeds.  Rosow  meets with Megan, gets the money, but in doing so Rosow must relive the fact that he has lost his wife and world as a result of 9/11, changing his priorities of how to end his assignment: does he turn over Harold and take the small fortune or does he follow his heart?  He does the right thing.Though the story is a strongly told mystery thriller it is first and foremost a story about the loss and disorientation that have paralyzed so many people following 9/11.  The beauty of THE MISSING PERSON is the message that in many ways we are all 'missing persons' now.  How we elect to deal with that is the part of the story we individually must complete.  Michael Shannon enters the ranks of significant film actors with this deeply touching role.  This is a little film that deserves a very wide audience.

1319715,A356RFKNIG043B,B00333M6R6,K. Swanson,"[10, 11]","I'm surprised there's only one other review of this film here. It's quite a solid piece of work.Shannon is exceptional as the gumshoe, and director Buschel has a field day both fulfilling and mocking many noir tropes: the film is about a private detective  from L.A., there's a scene of L.A. in the rain with neon reflections, the private dick is a heavy drinker, he's non-stop laconic and wise-cracking, he's tortured by a past he won't talk about, and on and on. As a big fan of all things noir (read: unusually honest, in a highly stylized way), I found MP to be both very entertaining and strangely disquieting.There's something a little off about this movie, but in a good way. Just when it seems to be getting typical of the genre, some weird new event will occur and throw everything off kilter. It would be spoilerish to share those events, but suffice to say that they're unexpected and work well. The script is intelligent and concise, while never stooping to either worship or parody of Hammett, Chandler, Cain, or any of the many great films noir of the 40s and 50s. Missing Person is very much its own beast, while paying tribute to one of the great American film and literary genres.A real highlight for me was the scene where they use one of my favorite old doo-wop songs to great effect. Why don't more films use doo-wop? There are so many superb songs waiting to be mined, and the power of the phenomenal singing and melody works to perfection here. I loved that scene; you'll know it when you see it.I'd recommend Missing Person highly to anyone who likes noir in any form, and those who appreciate intelligent writing and direction allied with a truly fine actor. I hope to see plenty more of Shannon; he's a real talent and makes this movie what it is: uniquely satisfying.",4,"Very unique, oddly low-key noir",1272412800,"04 28, 2010",2010,1793,"[""'m"", 'surprised', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'review', 'film', 'here', 'quite', 'solid', 'piece', 'work.Shannon', 'exceptional', 'gumshoe', 'director', 'Buschel', 'field', 'day', 'fulfilling', 'mocking', 'many', 'noir', 'tropes', 'film', 'private', 'detective', 'L.A.', 'scene', 'L.A.', 'rain', 'neon', 'reflections', 'private', 'dick', 'heavy', 'drinker', 'non-stop', 'laconic', 'wise-cracking', 'tortured', 'past', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'big', 'fan', 'things', 'noir', 'read', 'unusually', 'honest', 'highly', 'stylized', 'way', 'found', 'MP', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'strangely', 'something', 'little', 'off', 'movie', 'good', 'way', 'Just', 'when', 'be', 'getting', 'typical', 'genre', 'weird', 'new', 'event', 'will', 'occur', 'throw', 'everything', 'off', 'kilter', 'would', 'be', 'spoilerish', 'share', 'events', 'suffice', 'say', ""'re"", 'unexpected', 'work', 'well', 'script', 'intelligent', 'concise', 'never', 'stooping', 'worship', 'parody', 'Hammett', 'Chandler', 'Cain', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'noir', '40s', '50s', 'Missing', 'Person', 'very', 'much', 'own', 'beast', 'paying', 'tribute', 'one', 'great', 'American', 'film', 'literary', 'genres.A', 'real', 'highlight', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'use', 'one', 'favorite', 'old', 'doo-wop', 'songs', 'great', 'effect', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'more', 'films', 'use', 'doo-wop', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'superb', 'songs', 'waiting', 'be', 'mined', 'power', 'phenomenal', 'singing', 'melody', 'works', 'perfection', 'here', 'loved', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'see', 'it.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Missing', 'Person', 'highly', 'anyone', 'who', 'noir', 'form', 'who', 'appreciate', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'direction', 'allied', 'truly', 'fine', 'actor', 'hope', 'see', 'plenty', 'more', 'Shannon', 'real', 'talent', 'movie', 'what', 'uniquely', 'satisfying']",N/A

1319717,A3TO3AY1UFM83U,B00333M6R6,"not a natural ""Bob Bickel""","[0, 0]","The Missing Person is the only movie I've ever seen that transforms itself from a pretty low-grade film noir caricature into a solid and even uplifting story of tragedy followed by redemption with just a few well-placed, finely wrought scenes that could have easily gone in a hopelessly morbid direction.  Michael Shannon is a former cop, now a private eye who lives on whiskey and cigarettes.  Most of the time he looks and acts the part of a guy who has touched bottom and stuck there.  We can only wonder why anyone with resources would hire him to locate a missing child.  As Shannon goes from coast to coast in search of the lost kid, however, he shows us that drunk or sober, badly disheveled or more or less together, he's a lot smarter than we expected.  If we knew him and his still clouded history, he's the guy we'd want searching for out lost child.Throughout most of The Missing Person, the ambience provided by a grossly exaggerated art deco physical setting adds credibility to the noir nature of the movie.  There seems to be no way that Shannon's character, even if he is smarter than we had thought, could salvage much of anything from his hopelessly dissolute life.  I never suspected, not even for an instant, that we were being set up to have recent American history provide a totally unexpected source of really quite believable explanation and redemption.  Shannon's character is equally oblivious to the prospect of recovering hope and purpose.When all is said and done, we come to realize that Shannon's self-mortifying way of living makes more sense than we had expected.  We also learn that he can recognize moral recovery in others, and though inconsistent with his pecuniary interests, do the right thing and benefit thereby.This is a good movie, but it's got to be watched from start to finish.  About half way through, I was ready to turn it off as a really stupid effort to produce an exaggerated take on '50's style film noir for no particular reason.  Michael Shannon is a very good actor who plays his role to perfection in a movie that reminds us that until we understand the full context, we are likely to misjudge and misinterpret people and events in our social world.",5,Don't write this one off too soon,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,2207,"['Missing', 'Person', 'only', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'transforms', 'pretty', 'low-grade', 'film', 'noir', 'caricature', 'solid', 'even', 'uplifting', 'story', 'tragedy', 'followed', 'redemption', 'just', 'few', 'well-placed', 'finely', 'wrought', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'gone', 'hopelessly', 'morbid', 'direction', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'former', 'cop', 'now', 'private', 'eye', 'who', 'whiskey', 'cigarettes', 'Most', 'time', 'part', 'guy', 'who', 'touched', 'bottom', 'stuck', 'there', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'why', 'anyone', 'resources', 'would', 'hire', 'locate', 'missing', 'child', 'Shannon', 'coast', 'coast', 'search', 'lost', 'kid', 'however', 'drunk', 'sober', 'badly', 'disheveled', 'more', 'less', 'together', 'lot', 'smarter', 'expected', 'knew', 'still', 'clouded', 'history', 'guy', ""'d"", 'want', 'searching', 'out', 'lost', 'child.Throughout', 'most', 'Missing', 'Person', 'ambience', 'provided', 'grossly', 'exaggerated', 'art', 'deco', 'physical', 'setting', 'credibility', 'noir', 'nature', 'movie', 'be', 'way', 'Shannon', 'character', 'even', 'smarter', 'had', 'thought', 'could', 'salvage', 'much', 'anything', 'hopelessly', 'dissolute', 'life', 'never', 'suspected', 'not', 'even', 'instant', 'were', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'have', 'recent', 'American', 'history', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'source', 'really', 'quite', 'believable', 'explanation', 'redemption', 'Shannon', 'character', 'equally', 'oblivious', 'prospect', 'recovering', 'hope', 'purpose.When', 'said', 'done', 'come', 'realize', 'Shannon', 'self-mortifying', 'way', 'living', 'more', 'sense', 'had', 'expected', 'also', 'learn', 'can', 'recognize', 'moral', 'recovery', 'others', 'inconsistent', 'pecuniary', 'interests', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'benefit', 'thereby.This', 'good', 'movie', 'got', 'be', 'watched', 'start', 'finish', 'half', 'way', 'was', 'ready', 'turn', 'off', 'really', 'stupid', 'effort', 'produce', 'exaggerated', 'take', 'style', 'film', 'noir', 'particular', 'reason', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'very', 'good', 'actor', 'who', 'role', 'perfection', 'movie', 'understand', 'full', 'context', 'are', 'likely', 'misjudge', 'misinterpret', 'people', 'events', 'social', 'world']",N/A
