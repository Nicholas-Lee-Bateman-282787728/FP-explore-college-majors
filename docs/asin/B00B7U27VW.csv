It had a good cast except for that chick from Dances with  Wolves Mary McDonnell, totally wooden. Emmy sang and her from opera to pop didn't translate but it was better than the plot.

Can not understand though for the life of me why they filmed it the way they did, it looks like it was filmed in the seventies and in this day and age that's unacceptable. It's an interesting story and I think it's worth watching if you want to see a feel good, light-hearted romantic comedy. Of course it is completely unrealistic which is annoying about these movies. Girl comes from small town to big city and has achieved all her dreams in a week. But that's not why we watch these movies, we watch them specifically for that reason.",3,Not bad but it seems as if it was filmed in the seventies,1383091200,"10 30, 2013",2013,588,"['decent', 'moments', 'acting', 'good', 'Can', 'not', 'understand', 'life', 'why', 'filmed', 'way', 'did', 'was', 'filmed', 'seventies', 'day', 'age', 'unacceptable', 'interesting', 'story', 'think', 'worth', 'watching', 'want', 'see', 'feel', 'good', 'light-hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'course', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'annoying', 'movies', 'Girl', 'small', 'town', 'big', 'city', 'achieved', 'dreams', 'week', 'not', 'why', 'watch', 'movies', 'watch', 'specifically', 'reason']",Nola
