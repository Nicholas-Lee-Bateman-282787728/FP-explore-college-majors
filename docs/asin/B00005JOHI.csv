640409,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JOHI,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[5, 10]","There is a sweep and grandeur to ""Pride and Prejudice,"" which gives the movie an instant appeal.  Based on the Jane Austin classic, the scenes move forward at a brisk pace to keep our interest, but it is the portrayals that make the movie continually engaging.The Bennet family is of small means.  The father, and, particularly, the mother, are interested in seeking suitors for each of their five daughters.  Focus is primarily on Elizabeth (Keira Knightly), or ""Lizzie,"" the protagonist, who is treated like the ugly duckling of the five.  She is captivating for her wit and intelligence. We immediately have an affinity to her, for she never suffers fools gladly, and she has the brazenness to confront those of higher standing who may belittle her.  So, the situation is ripe when an aristocrat, Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyed) and his friend, Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), pay a visit to the household.  After some social invitations and gatherings, Mr. Bingley takes a fancy to Jane, her favored elder sister, but it provides opportunities for Lizzie to mingle with the seemingly cold and aloof, Mr. Darcy.  There are many instances when the two meet and work out their desires and distastes for one another.  He regards her as saucy; she finds  him to be arrogant.  Many partial disclosures of his past help to make a portrait of him that she increasingly detests.  There is a diversion when a guest suitor, Mr. Collins, a respectable and scrupulous moral figure, visits the household and forces his affections upon her.  There is also a key crisis when the youngest daughter is taken by a suitor in a situation that may be described as compromising.  Once affections are fully realized, Lizzie is confronted by Mr. Darcy's aunt, the indomitable Lady Catherine de Bourg (Judi[th] Dench).The new production of ""Pride and Prejudice"" has many merits.  The scenes unfold with a grace and movement that is instantly appealing.  Especially the dancing and mingling scenes are choreographed with finesse.  Similar British movies with great acclaim are sometimes tedious affairs, but this one is winning.  The characters, including the nervous mother, the affectionate father, and the likable Mr. Bingley, are exemplary draws.  The portrayals, especially by Knightly, MacFadyed, and Dench are enthralling.  The novel, which I confess I've never read, is probably followed closely--it would be hard to imagine otherwise--but I don't wish to put up pretenses or consult other reviews.  However, it is easy to appreciate the skillfulness that Austin uses through her mouthpiece, Elizabeth, to confront the attitudes and mores of the upper classes.  Maintaining her charm and dignity, she is able to answer to the impossible standards suitors make upon their chosen mistresses for courtship.  Like ""Lady Chatterly's Lover"" and ""Jude, the Obscure,"" which I have read, ""Pride and Prejudice"" overthrows the mores and conventions of aristocratic arrogance with style and skill.  The movie captures the spirit well.",5,To Be Savoured,1149379200,"06 4, 2006",2006,3000,"['sweep', 'grandeur', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'movie', 'instant', 'appeal', 'Based', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'classic', 'scenes', 'move', 'forward', 'brisk', 'pace', 'keep', 'interest', 'portrayals', 'make', 'movie', 'continually', 'engaging.The', 'Bennet', 'family', 'small', 'means', 'father', 'particularly', 'mother', 'are', 'interested', 'seeking', 'suitors', 'five', 'daughters', 'Focus', 'primarily', 'Elizabeth', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'Lizzie', 'protagonist', 'who', 'treated', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'five', 'captivating', 'wit', 'intelligence', 'immediately', 'have', 'affinity', 'never', 'fools', 'gladly', 'brazenness', 'confront', 'higher', 'standing', 'who', 'may', 'belittle', 'So', 'situation', 'ripe', 'when', 'aristocrat', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyed', 'friend', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'Simon', 'Woods', 'pay', 'visit', 'household', 'social', 'invitations', 'gatherings', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'fancy', 'Jane', 'favored', 'elder', 'sister', 'opportunities', 'Lizzie', 'mingle', 'seemingly', 'cold', 'aloof', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'are', 'many', 'instances', 'when', 'two', 'meet', 'work', 'out', 'desires', 'distastes', 'one', 'saucy', 'be', 'arrogant', 'Many', 'partial', 'disclosures', 'past', 'help', 'make', 'portrait', 'increasingly', 'diversion', 'when', 'guest', 'suitor', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'respectable', 'scrupulous', 'moral', 'figure', 'household', 'affections', 'also', 'key', 'crisis', 'when', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'taken', 'suitor', 'situation', 'may', 'be', 'described', 'compromising', 'affections', 'are', 'fully', 'realized', 'Lizzie', 'confronted', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'aunt', 'indomitable', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourg', 'Judi', '[', 'th', ']', 'Dench', '.The', 'new', 'production', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'many', 'merits', 'scenes', 'unfold', 'grace', 'movement', 'instantly', 'appealing', 'Especially', 'dancing', 'mingling', 'scenes', 'are', 'choreographed', 'finesse', 'Similar', 'British', 'movies', 'great', 'acclaim', 'are', 'sometimes', 'tedious', 'affairs', 'one', 'winning', 'characters', 'including', 'nervous', 'mother', 'affectionate', 'father', 'likable', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'are', 'exemplary', 'draws', 'portrayals', 'especially', 'Knightly', 'MacFadyed', 'Dench', 'are', 'enthralling', 'novel', 'confess', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'probably', 'followed', 'closely', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'imagine', 'otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'put', 'up', 'pretenses', 'consult', 'other', 'reviews', 'However', 'easy', 'appreciate', 'skillfulness', 'Austin', 'mouthpiece', 'Elizabeth', 'confront', 'attitudes', 'mores', 'upper', 'classes', 'Maintaining', 'charm', 'dignity', 'able', 'answer', 'impossible', 'standards', 'suitors', 'make', 'chosen', 'mistresses', 'courtship', 'Lady', 'Chatterly', 'Lover', 'Jude', 'Obscure', 'have', 'read', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'mores', 'conventions', 'aristocratic', 'arrogance', 'style', 'skill', 'movie', 'spirit', 'well']",N/A
640410,A2GDEPPC8BAZRY,B00005JOHI,"A. Casalino ""V^^^^^V""","[18, 22]","Once again, I have had the pleasure of finding one of Jane Austen's classic novels brought to the big screen -- and once more I couldn't fancy myself happier.  Ah- would that there were hundreds of such renderings!Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is amongst all in the whole vast world of literature the dearest to my heart.  Therefore, even a version that deigns tamper with a decade-old perfection serves to excite my interest.  Indeed- for I was simply ecstatic when, in 1995, A&E; and the BBC collaborated to create a grand and brilliantly performed portrayal of that book.  At a length of nearly 6 hours, no aspect of this wonderful story had been neglected - and I knew that such a true commitment to the literature, combined with such passion for the tale, is a precious rarity in film. Now, years hence, that 1995 picture still resonates.  Comparisons are to be inevitable, no doubt.  I'd already been well reconciled to the fact that a two-hour version of the story, no matter how well done, could only suffer in the comparison to that A&E; production.  I therefore resolved to judge this movie by its own qualities -- And what fine qualities they turned out being!  Brilliantly directed by Joe Wright, this sensual and earthy interpretation just warms my soul.Keira Knightley takes on the role of our heroine: Elizabeth Bennet, the 2nd oldest of the five daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet (Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn).  Matthew MacFadyen plays our hero: Mr. Darcy, the handsome and aloof owner of a great estate in the north of England.  The two go down the dance, waltzing through misunderstanding and mischance - wit and romance, dexterously stepping along fine lines of social propriety and distinction of class, through rejection and redemption, conjuring the many diversions of country life in Regency England. Yes, we Janeites all know the story.The casting herein is essentially very agreeable.  Knightly is lovely and makes for a fine Elizabeth, and the camera adores her- though when Darcy finds her appearance only ""tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me,"" it strikes one as rather unbelievable.  She effortlessly captures Lizzy's wry spirit and spark of humor, though I must admit I found her a little bit wanting in that quiet depth or the brilliance of mind that role calls for.MacFadyen's take on Darcy is more dark and brooding than actors in the past have portrayed him.  And though I enjoyed watching him, I cannot say that he did very well in expressing the changes Mr. Darcy undergoes:  I did not see an aristocrat stuffed with pride, whose passion for Elizabeth blossoms as he becomes transformed by her spirited influence.  Rather, he just seems to convey the same brooding manner all along - and his only problem appears to be that he is misunderstood.As for the supporting players, I think Sutherland was excellent as the bemused Mr. Bennet - and his scene with Lizzy at the end was exquisitely drawn.  Blethyn played her part very well, too - her Mrs. Bennet was every bit as laughable and endearing as Austen wrote her.  Judi Dench was wonderfully formidable as Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  The roles of Mr. Collins, Jane Bennet, Mr. Bingley and Wickham were also excellently played.Visually, this film is just stunning.  I've rarely, if ever, seen more exquisite scenery in a movie. The camera work is mesmerizing.  The cinematography here is certainly Oscar-worthy.  I can even forgive the overly rusticated state (complete with chickens, pigs, & all manner of livestock traipsing throughout the house) of Longbourn, the Bennet family home.  This, in fact, only serves to give charm to this beautiful and totally unique rendition of a most beloved story.",5,Picturesque and Pleasing,1133568000,"12 3, 2005",2005,3707,"['Once', 'again', 'have', 'had', 'pleasure', 'finding', 'one', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'classic', 'novels', 'brought', 'big', 'screen', 'once', 'more', 'could', ""n't"", 'fancy', 'happier', 'Ah-', 'would', 'were', 'hundreds', 'such', 'renderings', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'amongst', 'whole', 'vast', 'world', 'literature', 'dearest', 'heart', 'Therefore', 'even', 'version', 'decade-old', 'perfection', 'serves', 'excite', 'interest', 'Indeed-', 'was', 'simply', 'ecstatic', 'when', '1995', 'A', 'E', 'BBC', 'collaborated', 'create', 'grand', 'brilliantly', 'performed', 'portrayal', 'book', 'length', 'nearly', '6', 'hours', 'aspect', 'wonderful', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'neglected', 'knew', 'true', 'commitment', 'literature', 'combined', 'such', 'passion', 'tale', 'precious', 'rarity', 'film', 'Now', 'years', 'hence', '1995', 'picture', 'still', 'Comparisons', 'are', 'be', 'inevitable', 'doubt', ""'d"", 'already', 'been', 'well', 'reconciled', 'fact', 'two-hour', 'version', 'story', 'matter', 'how', 'well', 'done', 'could', 'only', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'A', 'E', 'production', 'therefore', 'resolved', 'judge', 'movie', 'own', 'qualities', 'what', 'fine', 'qualities', 'turned', 'out', 'being', 'Brilliantly', 'directed', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'sensual', 'earthy', 'interpretation', 'just', 'warms', 'soul.Keira', 'Knightley', 'role', 'heroine', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', '2nd', 'oldest', 'five', 'daughters', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'hero', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'handsome', 'aloof', 'owner', 'great', 'estate', 'north', 'England', 'two', 'go', 'dance', 'waltzing', 'misunderstanding', 'mischance', 'wit', 'romance', 'dexterously', 'stepping', 'along', 'fine', 'lines', 'social', 'propriety', 'distinction', 'class', 'rejection', 'redemption', 'conjuring', 'many', 'diversions', 'country', 'life', 'Regency', 'England', 'Yes', 'Janeites', 'know', 'story.The', 'casting', 'herein', 'essentially', 'very', 'agreeable', 'Knightly', 'lovely', 'fine', 'Elizabeth', 'camera', 'her-', 'when', 'Darcy', 'appearance', 'only', 'tolerable', 'not', 'handsome', 'enough', 'tempt', 'one', 'rather', 'unbelievable', 'effortlessly', 'Lizzy', 'wry', 'spirit', 'spark', 'humor', 'must', 'admit', 'found', 'little', 'bit', 'wanting', 'quiet', 'depth', 'brilliance', 'mind', 'role', 'for.MacFadyen', 'take', 'Darcy', 'more', 'dark', 'brooding', 'actors', 'past', 'have', 'portrayed', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'expressing', 'changes', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'aristocrat', 'stuffed', 'pride', 'passion', 'Elizabeth', 'blossoms', 'transformed', 'spirited', 'influence', 'Rather', 'just', 'convey', 'same', 'brooding', 'manner', 'only', 'problem', 'be', 'misunderstood.As', 'supporting', 'players', 'think', 'Sutherland', 'was', 'excellent', 'bemused', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'scene', 'Lizzy', 'end', 'was', 'exquisitely', 'drawn', 'Blethyn', 'played', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'too', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'was', 'bit', 'laughable', 'endearing', 'as', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'formidable', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'de', 'Bourgh', 'roles', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'Jane', 'Bennet', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'Wickham', 'were', 'also', 'excellently', 'played.Visually', 'film', 'just', 'stunning', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'ever', 'seen', 'more', 'exquisite', 'scenery', 'movie', 'camera', 'work', 'mesmerizing', 'cinematography', 'here', 'certainly', 'Oscar-worthy', 'can', 'even', 'forgive', 'overly', 'rusticated', 'state', 'complete', 'chickens', 'pigs', 'manner', 'livestock', 'traipsing', 'house', 'Longbourn', 'Bennet', 'family', 'home', 'fact', 'only', 'give', 'charm', 'beautiful', 'totally', 'unique', 'rendition', 'most', 'beloved', 'story']",N/A
640411,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B00005JOHI,A Customer,"[22, 23]","In this latest version of Pride and Prejudice, Director Joe Wright uses impressive visuals and sumptuous period locales to create an exquisite wide-screen spectacle, filling it with details that illustrate important sociological information about its central family, the Bennets. From the movie's mist-filled and dream-like opening moments to its marvelous ball sequence and the predictable but nonetheless glorious ending, Pride & Prejudice is an absolutely sumptuous evocation of Jane Austen's milieu, and is a captivatingly youthful spin without compromising the novel's late-eighteenth-century manners; it also deserves to be remembered as one of the very best screen adaptations of this book so far.Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) is fraught with worry. The mother of five daughters has proved to be a little bit much for her and if they don't start marrying soon, the family will be ruined. The father (Donald Sutherland) stays out of the way, hoping his daughters somehow overcome societal prejudice against their gender and make something of their minds.  Headstrong Elizabeth (Kira Knightley) has done just that. Smart, feisty, and fiercely independent, Lizzie promises herself that she won't be one to settle.When Lizzie's older sister, Jane (Rosamund Pike), meets the wealthy Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods) at a dance, their future as a couple seems predetermined. But when Lizzie is introduced to the gloomy and standoffish Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), an instant dislike is established. Lizzie and Mr. Darcy must overcome quite a few obstacles before they can transcend their dislike of each other, not the least of which is unsuitable suitor Mr. Collins (a wonderfully comic Tom Hollander) and Darcy's formidable aunt Lady Catherine (Dame Judi Dench) who tells Lizzie that she is of an ""inferior class."" Of course, Lizzie's frosty rejection of Darcy eventually thaws when he confesses his passion for her one evening on a misty moor.Pride and Prejudice really works because of the marvelously impassioned performances from its two sexy leads. As the strong-willed Elizabeth, Knightley is tantalizing and seductive, so perfectly fitting into her 19th century Austen surroundings; she catches Elizabeth's essential skittishness and youthful braggadocio, making her final conversion with Darcy all the more moving. Macfadyen as Darcy is a more conflicted, softer figure than Colin Firth's indelibly etched performance, but Macfadyen is much earthier and sexier, and his portrayal is one that fits the movie's more realistic mood.Pride and Prejudice benefits from Wright's intensely visual approach that manages to meld realism with romance in a canny balance. The movie has a youthful essence, as well as providing a richly detailed setting. Scenes barely sketched in Austen's dialogue-heavy, description-light prose leap fully detailed onto the screen, thanks to Sarah Greenwood's terrific production design and Jacqueline Durran's textured costumes. This is a unique, gorgeously evocative, and quite accomplished film, which should satisfy even the most rabid Austen-ophiles - just lovely.

640412,A3LVL18L95JETF,B00005JOHI,Agnes Vanderveen,"[7, 9]","Pride and Prejudice is a great movie! Both Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen give great performances. Rosamund Pike as the elder sister, Jane, is a delight. Simon Woods as Bingley is wrongly portrayed as rather foolish, but he is absolutely cute and adorable about Jane, so it's all good. Claudie Blakely (Charlotte Lucas/Collins) gives a much more sympathetic performance than any other Charlotte before her. The friendship between Lizzy and Charlotte feels totally right and believable.I feel it is my duty to warn you that the ending scenes are very close to horrendous, at least to Janeites. The dialogue is cheesy, and the second proposal is in the early morning, with both Lizzy and Darcy in their nightclothes. Darcy especially made me cringe. When the movie all of a sudden jumps from Mr. Bennet's consent to Pemberley, you have to cringe again. And then grit your teeth when Darcy and Lizzy are again in their nightclothes, and saying lines that are so syrupy you want to laugh, but have to cry b/c it's P+P that this crew is messing up.There are many things wrong with the movie, but I love a lot of things in it too. For instance, when Lizzy sees Darcy at Rosings. The scene when Bingley and Darcy practice Bingley's proposal to Jane.

640415,A1S26JXPQKFVPI,B00005JOHI,Alexander Arsov,"[14, 18]","Of the four versions of ""Pride and Prejudice"" I have seen (1940, 1980, 1995, 2005), this one is definitely the nadir. To begin with, it's astonishingly ugly. It looks like the Middle Ages in Asia rather than like England of the early nineteenth century. Even after making the usual allowances for omissions and changes during the adaptation, the screenplay departs from Jane's original in a most deplorable way. It is this version, not the 1940 one, which is the real travesty, if not in terms of plot at all events in terms of characters.Whoever had the bright idea of casting Keira Knightley as Lizzy did a great disservice to the future generations. I shudder to think how many people will see this movie without any prior knowledge of the novel and will think, quite mistakenly, that Keira's portrayal has anything to do with Jane's; if they ever come to read the book later, they would probably be too full of pride and prejudice to really appreciate it. Keira's vapid performance, rife with hideous grins that apparently pass for smiles, is fully matched by the worst Darcy imaginable. The proud and conceited gentleman has been scaled down to a timid and tedious creature.The supporting cast, despite the presence of such illustrious names like Donald Sutherland (Mr Bennet who speaks his generally witty lines with a funereal air) and Judi Dench (Lady Catherine who sounds much more like Lady Macbeth), is no improvement over the weak principals. There is not a trace of Mr Collins' trademark pomposity or Mrs Bennet's equally typical (and fake) hysteria. Jane is supposed to be a placid creature, but is this one entirely devoid of life! The whole cast speak their lines in the most contrived and unnatural manner. All grace, charm and vivacity of the original have been lost.There is nothing redeeming about this movie (except, perhaps, Lydia and the interlude with the marble statues).

Also, trying to condense the book into 2 hrs  cuts the characters into 2 dimesionals. This movie feels more like a stage production with the acting. Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench are the sole exceptions. Kiera Knightley does a good job but when compared to Jennifer Ehle - well no one compares to her acting. The Mr. Darcy in this movie looks incredible as does the handsome actor who plays Mr. Wickham yet even their acting is stiff though Darcy's gets better towards the middle half. This whole movie feels rushed - in a matter of 10 minutes we are introduced to Mr. Collins and then Mr. Wickham.

640418,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00005JOHI,Alistair McHarg,"[3, 6]","Pride And Prejudice is an exuberant celebration of what movies do best.  In one meticulously constructed scene after another it showers viewers with eye candy and in so doing, transports them to a distant, fascinating place and time.  In a cynical age such as ours, where every image is suspect, this is more difficult than one might imagine; director Joe Wright's success is complete.Jane Austen's Pride And Prejudice has demonstrated Rocky-esque box office endurance.  Were she alive today, Austen might marvel at our attraction to this tale of marriage as business, crushing social stratification, and nuanced mannerisms - told with precision, wit, and irony - considering that our own society, though bloated with both pride and prejudice, possesses none of the refined subtleties she described.Apart from our Anglophile obsession, born of the indebtedness we feel for providing our culture, such as it is, this attraction is most easily traced to the character of Elizabeth (Keira Knightly), a smart, beautiful, and appealingly feisty young woman who holds out for love over financially-motivated marriage.  (Heresy!)  While older sister Jane (Rosamund Pike) may be lovelier, we root for Liz as she battles uphill. Her triumph does not seem facile, Liz is tested and must grow - indeed, we cheer her victory because we sense she will not abuse it.Superb performances abound, led by Judi Dench as Lady Catherine.  From her comfy chair on top of the food chain, Dench embodies the full force of social pressure as you've never seen it before - terrifying.  Matthew MacFadyen is compelling as Mr. Darcy, he has on-screen presence and commands attention with his quiet, thoughtful demeanor.  Keira Knightly carries the picture admirably, mischievous without being obnoxious, self-absorbed without being narcissistic, sharp-witted without being needlessly cynical.  Brenda Blethyn (Mrs. Bennet) is wonderfully nutty, ambitious, and calculating while Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennet), workmanlike as ever, should have been told that a Canadian accent is not an English accent.  Tom Hollander, as Reverend Collins, isn't on camera much but is simply brilliant.Pride And Prejudice reveals a world where function follows form, not vice versa.  In one glorious scene the five Bennet sisters dance at a ball and Liz scrupulously avoids the advances of Reverend Collins while attempting to attract Darcy.  This is the carefully delineated atmosphere of Jane Austen; it's a wonderful place to visit.",5,Bride And Purchase Price,1153353600,"07 20, 2006",2006,2489,"['Pride', 'Prejudice', 'exuberant', 'celebration', 'what', 'movies', 'do', 'best', 'one', 'meticulously', 'constructed', 'scene', 'viewers', 'eye', 'candy', 'so', 'doing', 'distant', 'fascinating', 'place', 'time', 'cynical', 'age', 'such', 'ours', 'where', 'image', 'suspect', 'more', 'difficult', 'one', 'might', 'imagine', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'success', 'complete.Jane', 'Austen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'demonstrated', 'Rocky-esque', 'box', 'office', 'endurance', 'Were', 'alive', 'today', 'Austen', 'might', 'marvel', 'attraction', 'tale', 'marriage', 'business', 'crushing', 'social', 'stratification', 'nuanced', 'mannerisms', 'told', 'precision', 'wit', 'irony', 'considering', 'own', 'society', 'though', 'bloated', 'pride', 'prejudice', 'none', 'refined', 'subtleties', 'described.Apart', 'Anglophile', 'obsession', 'born', 'indebtedness', 'feel', 'providing', 'culture', 'such', 'attraction', 'most', 'easily', 'traced', 'character', 'Elizabeth', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'smart', 'beautiful', 'appealingly', 'feisty', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'out', 'love', 'financially-motivated', 'marriage', 'Heresy', 'older', 'sister', 'Jane', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'may', 'be', 'lovelier', 'root', 'Liz', 'uphill', 'triumph', 'not', 'seem', 'facile', 'Liz', 'tested', 'must', 'grow', 'indeed', 'cheer', 'victory', 'sense', 'will', 'not', 'abuse', 'it.Superb', 'performances', 'abound', 'led', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'comfy', 'chair', 'top', 'food', 'chain', 'Dench', 'full', 'force', 'social', 'pressure', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'terrifying', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'compelling', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'on-screen', 'presence', 'attention', 'quiet', 'thoughtful', 'demeanor', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'picture', 'admirably', 'mischievous', 'being', 'obnoxious', 'self-absorbed', 'being', 'narcissistic', 'sharp-witted', 'being', 'needlessly', 'cynical', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'wonderfully', 'nutty', 'ambitious', 'calculating', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'workmanlike', 'ever', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'Canadian', 'accent', 'not', 'English', 'accent', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'Reverend', 'Collins', ""n't"", 'camera', 'much', 'simply', 'brilliant.Pride', 'Prejudice', 'world', 'where', 'function', 'form', 'not', 'vice', 'versa', 'one', 'glorious', 'scene', 'five', 'Bennet', 'sisters', 'dance', 'ball', 'Liz', 'scrupulously', 'advances', 'Reverend', 'Collins', 'attempting', 'attract', 'Darcy', 'carefully', 'delineated', 'atmosphere', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'wonderful', 'place', 'visit']",N/A

Throughout the film he has to play the sourpuss and condescending Darcy who is unwilling and unable to show true emotion; however, if you really watch Macfadyen's performance you can see so much just by looking at his eyes, which convey so much that is left unsaid.

When it did, I was surprised to find that I love-love-love the new P & P as well.  I had people ask ""Which do you like better?"" and I could not answer because I loved both so much.  I recently ordered the new P & P on DVD and watched it back-to-back with the BBC miniseries to see if there was ANY way to determine if I had a preference.  In the end, I decided that I do like the BBC one a teeny-tiny bit more because I enjoy how much more exaggerated the characters are.  In the BBC version, Mrs. Bennett is more of an annoying drama queen and Mr. Collins is more repulsive (nearly impossible to imagine that ""old maid"" Charlotte would consent to marrying him - ugggh!).  In the new P & P, it seems more believable that Elizabeth would ""come around"" to Mr. Darcy because he is less ""standoffish"" than Colin Firth's character in the BBC version.  I enjoyed Keira Knightly in the new version but there was something about what I call Jennifer Ehle's ""secret amused smile"" in the BBC version that I feel really helps define Elizabeth's character.  All in all, if you're a P & P fan - you should own both.  If you are a person pressed for time - watch the shorter (new) version and if you have the time - watch the miniseries!

That is the one positive comment I can give this film.But a coyly giggling Elizabeth? When did Jane Austen ever intend the strongest female character she's ever written to be reduced to a girlish and immature giggler? Elizabeth is supposed to stand out among all the other girls as clever and quick witted, not a vapid silly girl the way her sisters are depicted. After all, is Jane Austen's Elizabeth the prettiest? No. Is the the smartest? No. Is she even the most talented? No. But that was the point! She stil has so much confidence and gumption that she can tell Darcy and his aunt off with skill and articulation.And Darcy? He's supposed to be proud. Not bland and boring.The proposal scene was an utter sham. How could the makers of this movie change the articulate monologues Elizabeth and Darcy recite and cut them up into dialogues to suit the modern audience's short attention span. Couldn't they sit through the monologues and feel the full punch of the words instead of having to have them disected into a back and forth dialogue which Austen clearly did not intend for them to be.I felt like the movie was trying to shout the entire time ""Look at this zoom in of the pig, look at this interesting angle of the Pemberly House from the ceiling! Look at me! There is a director for this movie! Forget about the timeless dialogue.

It starts with birds chirping on a beautiful landscape, moves to an odd close up, over the shoulder, of a book Lizzie is reading, but you can't see the title of, then has her walking over a FILTHY duck pond into a working farm house, eavesdropping on her parents.The whole movie goes back and forth between modern use of cameras against a backdrop of regency styles. The family, the costumes, the houses, are all regency, while the camera work fractures the story-telling with its movement from harshly lit close ups to single hand held shots. In the commentary, even the director admits Dame Judy Dench looks awful in her close ups when she comes to visit Lizzie in the middle of the night to confront her about Darcy's proposal. He talks about getting ideas on the way to filming different scenes - like the sunlit close up of Lizzie when she travels to Derbyshire with her aunt and uncle came to him when he put his head out the car door in the sunlight when he was going to a film location.This story seems filmed a bit off the hip, or off the cuff - improvised!I still love it. The unspoiled landscapes are gorgeous. From the Longbourne house with its moat and surrounding wildlife and even the farm life to the gorgeous grecian temple in Wiltshire - I will try to go there now that I know where it is - where Darcy proposes makes me melt to the cadence of Matthew MacFadyen's voice. I want to go there just to listen to the echoes of the scene - in the rain, of course. He is a revelation as Darcy, although I can also picture him in modern terms as a spy in his series Spooks. But he is fun and sexy. The close up of his hand after he touches Elizabeth helping her into the carriage is glorious.I would recommend listening to the directors comments about ALL  his casting choices, what he feels about their performances, the design of the sets, and how he made his decisions in telling the story.  (the ribbon dyeing scene is wonderful).So I would recommend this film to anyone.

640441,A1H11BV01L91I6,B00005JOHI,Ambergold,"[13, 18]","For those of us who are rabid Jane Austen fans, like myself, who went in to watch this looking forward to it but not expecting much after watching the superb and nearly-flawless BBC miniseries with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth countless times, this movie was a joyous and exhilerating shock. I admit that after watching the preview and reading everything there was to read about it before it  came out, I wasn't expecting much.I was still crazy-wild to see it-it looked very romantic and come on, its Pride and Prejudice-but Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy looked plain and boring, and some of the changes to the handling of the atmostphere and everything sounded very dubious. Having said that, I went in and came out stunned. The new movie is gorgeous, tender, passionate, lovely, fun. But mostly it brought back to me a feeling of what love is really like-that understanding that we've lost so completely after hordes of mediocre and wishy-washy romantic comedies and soap operas. The only thing that has come close to re-creating that feeling is Titanic,and I thought that Pride and Prejudice did a better job. And Matthew MacFadyen was superb as Darcy. He is Darcy-he captures a different version, a different part of him than Colin Firth, but he is as utterly him as Firth was. The man was perfect-by the end of the movie you are utterly in love with him. He starts out, like the movie,a little bit of a nonentity-you're not sure whether you like him or not. Then both he and the movie pick up speed and from there it just gets better and better until the ending, which is as nearly perfect as a movie ending can be. Don't mistake me-the old Pride and Prejudice will always in the end be the quintessential one, and Colin Firth's Darcy remains at the peak-but this movie is very nearly as good and MacFadyen's Darcy is really just as good, in a very different way(I never thought I would say that). MacFadyen played him with shyness, intensity, subtlety, warmth, idiocy, humour, and charm by turns,and by doing so turns out a very human and completely-perfect man. And his chemistry with Keira Knightley is exquisite-a miracle. In the end that is what makes up the movie-they light up the screen together. I haven't seen anything like it since-well-Titanic, and this movie shows it up in that area as well. Like the producers said after it was released,when they got the two actors together on the set something happened and they became their characters-two characters madly in love with each other.(Keira Knightley is just as good as MacFadyen-another mild surprise-she plays her with a delicacy and warmth completely lacking in most of her other performances.The moment when she steps down from the carriage and looks up at Pemberley and releases a quick bubble of laughter made up of equal part irony, delicious laughter,regret, and a sense of the ridiculous, is a cinematic moment that won't come again, and only she could have produced it).After watching it,I came out of the theater poised between sheer joy and hysterical laughter, and feeling an intense desire to be in love with someone-that is what the movie did to me.It is flawed-Jane and Bingley are pretty much ruined and several very important plot points are brushed over or ignored-the producers seemed to feel about two-thirds of the way throught the movie that they'd better speed it up,and so they rush through several major events at breakneck speed-but other things make you forgive them for it.Lady Catherine and Mr. Collins, while very different versions than in the BBC one, are good once you get used to them, and this is pretty much the case for all the minor characters with the exception perhaps of Bingley and his sister. Watch it, not really expecting it to be as good as the old one and definitely not hoping for the book, because it's not that-but it stands on its own as shining movie masterpiece of romanctic dramas.",5,It Shines...Near Perfection,1148601600,"05 26, 2006",2006,3903,"['who', 'are', 'rabid', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fans', 'who', 'went', 'watch', 'looking', 'forward', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'watching', 'superb', 'nearly-flawless', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'countless', 'times', 'movie', 'was', 'joyous', 'exhilerating', 'shock', 'admit', 'watching', 'preview', 'reading', 'everything', 'there', 'was', 'read', 'came', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much.I', 'was', 'still', 'crazy-wild', 'see', 'it-it', 'looked', 'very', 'romantic', 'come', 'Pride', 'Prejudice-but', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'Darcy', 'looked', 'plain', 'boring', 'changes', 'handling', 'atmostphere', 'everything', 'sounded', 'very', 'dubious', 'Having', 'said', 'went', 'came', 'out', 'stunned', 'new', 'movie', 'gorgeous', 'tender', 'passionate', 'lovely', 'fun', 'mostly', 'brought', 'back', 'feeling', 'what', 'love', 'really', 'like-that', 'understanding', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'so', 'completely', 'hordes', 'mediocre', 'wishy-washy', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'soap', 'operas', 'only', 'thing', 'come', 'close', 're-creating', 'feeling', 'Titanic', 'thought', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'was', 'superb', 'Darcy', 'Darcy-he', 'captures', 'different', 'version', 'different', 'part', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'utterly', 'Firth', 'was', 'man', 'was', 'perfect-by', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'utterly', 'love', 'out', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'nonentity-you', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'like', 'not', 'Then', 'movie', 'pick', 'up', 'speed', 'just', 'better', 'better', 'ending', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'movie', 'ending', 'can', 'be', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'me-the', 'old', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'will', 'always', 'end', 'be', 'quintessential', 'one', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Darcy', 'peak-but', 'movie', 'very', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'MacFadyen', 'Darcy', 'really', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'very', 'different', 'way', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'say', 'MacFadyen', 'played', 'shyness', 'intensity', 'subtlety', 'warmth', 'idiocy', 'humour', 'charm', 'turns', 'doing', 'so', 'out', 'very', 'human', 'completely-perfect', 'man', 'chemistry', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'exquisite-a', 'miracle', 'end', 'what', 'up', 'movie-they', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'together', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'anything', 'since-well-Titanic', 'movie', 'up', 'area', 'as', 'well', 'producers', 'said', 'was', 'released', 'when', 'got', 'two', 'actors', 'together', 'set', 'something', 'happened', 'became', 'characters-two', 'characters', 'madly', 'love', 'other', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'MacFadyen-another', 'mild', 'surprise-she', 'plays', 'delicacy', 'warmth', 'completely', 'lacking', 'most', 'other', 'performances.The', 'moment', 'when', 'steps', 'down', 'carriage', 'up', 'Pemberley', 'quick', 'bubble', 'laughter', 'made', 'equal', 'part', 'irony', 'delicious', 'laughter', 'regret', 'sense', 'ridiculous', 'cinematic', 'moment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'again', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'produced', '.After', 'watching', 'came', 'out', 'theater', 'poised', 'sheer', 'joy', 'hysterical', 'laughter', 'feeling', 'intense', 'desire', 'be', 'love', 'someone-that', 'what', 'movie', 'did', 'me.It', 'flawed-Jane', 'Bingley', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'ruined', 'several', 'very', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'brushed', 'ignored-the', 'producers', 'seemed', 'feel', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'throught', 'movie', ""'d"", 'better', 'speed', 'up', 'so', 'rush', 'several', 'major', 'events', 'breakneck', 'speed-but', 'other', 'things', 'make', 'forgive', 'it.Lady', 'Catherine', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'very', 'different', 'versions', 'BBC', 'one', 'are', 'good', 'once', 'get', 'used', 'pretty', 'much', 'case', 'minor', 'characters', 'exception', 'perhaps', 'Bingley', 'sister', 'Watch', 'not', 'really', 'expecting', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'old', 'one', 'definitely', 'not', 'hoping', 'book', 'not', 'that-but', 'own', 'shining', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'romanctic', 'dramas']",N/A

640443,AH93HX89KVQG2,B00005JOHI,"Amy Green ""Amy Green""","[10, 14]","First of all, no film adaptation can ever compare to the book itself. If you enjoyed whichever film version you've seen, including this one, read the book! You'll love it.I have read the book countless times. The 1980 BBC production starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul is the most accurate and thorough adaptation in my opinion. I don't care for the newer and more popular 1996 A&E; version because of the MANY liberties it takes, although the visuals are gorgeous. (You can read my comparison review of those two on their product listing pages:Pride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980)andPride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)).When I saw the preview for this new version, it just looked very ""Hollywood-ish"" -- over-emotive, mangled dialogue, too sappy and dramatic. And it seemed that Darcy, who is supposed to be handsome on the Adonis level, looked way too plain for the role. But I knew I had to watch it anyway, and I was pleasantly surprised. Although a lot of the book's scenes were left out to fit into the 2-hour time frame, the dialogue and scenes were well-chosen and more faithful to the book than I expected. Despite the shorter length, this newest movie version still captured the spirit of the novel. Each actor did wonderfully in his or her role... including wonderful appearances from Donald Sutherland as the droll yet affectionate Mr. Bennett, and Dame Judi Dench as the odious Lady Catherine De Burgh.My husband who likes to avoid sappy `chick flicks' even walked in the room while I was watching it, and sat down and watched the rest of it with me and really enjoyed it. (He had also enjoyed the 1980 BBC version).My complaints about it are:1) Mr. Bingley's hair looks utterly ridiculous (it's like a furry red dog sitting on top of his head) and I had to laugh every time he appeared on the scene.2) Speaking of hair, many characters did seem undergroomed, with very messy hair, no jewelry and very plain, drab-looking outfits; especially Elizabeth. I hated that brown dress! I guess they had to find a way to make Kiera Knightley seem less pretty than the actress playing Jane, which is certainly difficult since Kiera is considered one of the most beautiful women in the world. Add to that the messy scenes of pigs and farming and laundry hanging out to dry at the Bennett home, the whole family seemed perhaps of a lower class than they actually were... as if the director wanted to 'gritty' them up a bit.3) Mr. Darcy does not acknowledge to Elizabeth how much she helped him change to be more humble and considerate of others. One of the best lines in the book is when he says to her: ""... dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you? You taught me a lesson... by you I was properly humbled."" This is an important point, because one foundation of their love is their gratitude to each other for the changes each brought about in the other. In this version, the impression is given that it was only Elizabeth who was ever in the wrong and needing to change.4) Some liberties were of course taken with dialogue and the timing of events, and there were some contrived/invented scenes, including things that were not in the book at all, and things that would not have been appropriate for that time period. (Hollywood has never learned to leave well enough alone.) Examples include: family members hovering over every closed door to hear the conversations therein, and giggling and gawking at the people who had been conversing as they come out of the door; the 'rejected proposal' scene happening outside in the rain and them almost kissing (??!!??) during it; Lady Catherine visiting late at night; the `married' scene at the end; Mr. Bingley appearing in Jane's sickroom; a room of mostly naked statues in the Darcy home instead of the book's wall portraits (guess they had to get SOME sensuality in there somewhere); a sleepless Darcy and Elizabeth meeting up in the fog in the wee morning hours. Some of these were cool things in and of themselves; just not Austen. Bronte, maybe?But for some reason, those discrepancies did not bother me as much as they might have, and I think it is because they were so well offset by the positives of the film that had me really enjoying it and appreciating what I felt it DID pull out of the novel well. I had complaints of a similar nature about the 1995 A&E; version, but there wasn't enough `good' to offset my annoyance at what I considered `bad' in that version, whereas in this version the good outweighed the bad for me by more than enough. I think it's certainly a great introduction for anyone who is new to Austen.I did not think I would say this, but I will definitely buy this movie. It is an obviously romanticized version, but the added romanticism didn't bother me like I thought it would, and I found myself enjoying it.",4,Greatly exceeded the expectations of this die-hard

Johnson,"[6, 9]","I own the mini-series version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth, which is more true to the book, but I think this is the more entertaining film. Other reviewers have discussed the difference in performances by actors who are closer to the actual ages of the characters in the book and the more realistic setting. One difference between book and movie that I appreciated was the director's take on the relationship between the Bennet parents and his expansion of the minor characters. Here, Mr. Bennet is both exasperated by and in love with Mrs. Bennet; Mr. Collins is as annoying as ever, but we also sympathize with his vulnerability and social awkwardness. Elizabeth's sister Mary is still a preachy bluestocking, but the film doesn't just make fun of her; we also her as the awkward teenage girl who sobs in her father's arms after being embarrassed at the ball. The five girls are very convincing as sisers and their embarassing mama loves them dearly. Bingley is as shy as Jane and here we see Darcy helping him rehearse his marriage proposal to her. Darcy and Elizabeth seem a little more raw and REAL here. The director has really gotten at the humanity of all of the characters here in a way that adds a lot to the film. That, and it's not six hours long, which should appeal to anyone who doesn't have the patience to sit through the mini-series.",5,Lovely film adaptation.,1226102400,"11 8, 2008",2008,1362,"['own', 'mini-series', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'more', 'true', 'book', 'think', 'more', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'discussed', 'difference', 'performances', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'closer', 'actual', 'ages', 'characters', 'book', 'more', 'realistic', 'setting', 'One', 'difference', 'book', 'movie', 'appreciated', 'was', 'director', 'take', 'relationship', 'Bennet', 'parents', 'expansion', 'minor', 'characters', 'Here', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'exasperated', 'love', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'as', 'annoying', 'ever', 'also', 'sympathize', 'vulnerability', 'social', 'awkwardness', 'Elizabeth', 'sister', 'Mary', 'still', 'preachy', 'bluestocking', 'film', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'fun', 'also', 'awkward', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'father', 'arms', 'being', 'embarrassed', 'ball', 'five', 'girls', 'are', 'very', 'convincing', 'sisers', 'embarassing', 'mama', 'dearly', 'Bingley', 'as', 'shy', 'Jane', 'here', 'see', 'Darcy', 'helping', 'rehearse', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'seem', 'little', 'more', 'raw', 'REAL', 'here', 'director', 'really', 'gotten', 'humanity', 'characters', 'here', 'way', 'lot', 'film', 'not', 'six', 'hours', 'long', 'should', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'patience', 'sit', 'mini-series']",N/A
640446,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JOHI,Andrew Ellington,"[11, 16]","I don't know if I'll every truly know why, but I absolutely LOVE this movie.It's not as brilliant as `Sense and Sensibility' (mostly because it lacks the splendor that is Kate Winslet) but `Pride and Prejudice' is a perfect family film that builds off its subject to create a beautifully crafted masterpiece.  The performances match the surroundings and the direction by newcomer Joe Wright is astoundingly accurate and beautiful to look at.  Keira Knightley rightfully earned that Oscar nomination, for her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet is the best by far of anyone attempting at the coveted role.  The fact remains that `Pride and Prejudice' has been done and redone and supposedly mastered by BBC (and Colin Firth) in 1995.  While that is the case this beautiful reimagining of the classic Austen novel is, in my humble opinion, the best film adaptation, by far.The film, aside from being splendidly acted, is above and beyond a beauty to look at.  Each frame is astounding in its visual flare.  The camera pans out over the surroundings with beautiful precision.  Just watch the fog scene with Darcy and know that a picture speaks a thousand words.  It's graceful and mesmerizing.The film follows the love affair (or lack there of) between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, a pair made in Hollywood heaven.  She's strong-willed and opinionated as is he and they seem to butt-heads more than steal hearts but in the end there is no denying they are perfect for one another.  What makes this movie so brilliant is that it is in affect the catalysts for almost every other love story out there for these two characters seem to pop up in almost every teen film produced as of late.  These are the originals though, and with splendid performances by Knightley and Macfadyen are so effortless and uplifting in their impish immaturity that they breathe a whole new life to the classic tale.The supporting cast all hold their weight as well, especially the likes of Donald Sutherland who is perfectly cast as Elizabeth's father and Brenda Blethyn who plays her mother, but it's Dame Judi Dench who stole the show for me with her few moments of screen time.  She plays Lady Catherine de Bourg with such ferocity that her confrontation with Elizabeth was the highlight of the film for me.In the end I can only say good things for this film for I cannot find a single flaw.  Watching Keira chew up the scenery is orgasmic for me, especially when you think that this is the same girl who fights pirates and hunts criminals.  Under that action hero exterior is a giggly teenage girl who becomes so real to her audience that you can't help but fall madly in love with her.  `Pride and Prejudice' is a wonder of a film, a beautifully magnificent cinematic experience that brings nothing but joy and warmth to my heart.So I guess I do know why I love this film after all...go figure.",5,"Beautiful, mesmerizing and, simply put, utter perfection...",1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,2869,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'truly', 'know', 'why', 'absolutely', 'LOVE', 'movie.It', 'not', 'as', 'brilliant', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'mostly', 'splendor', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'perfect', 'family', 'film', 'subject', 'create', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'masterpiece', 'performances', 'match', 'surroundings', 'direction', 'newcomer', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'astoundingly', 'accurate', 'beautiful', 'look', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'rightfully', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'portrayal', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'best', 'far', 'anyone', 'attempting', 'coveted', 'role', 'fact', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'been', 'done', 'redone', 'supposedly', 'mastered', 'BBC', 'Colin', 'Firth', '1995', 'case', 'beautiful', 'reimagining', 'classic', 'Austen', 'novel', 'humble', 'opinion', 'best', 'film', 'adaptation', 'far.The', 'film', 'aside', 'being', 'splendidly', 'acted', 'above', 'beauty', 'look', 'frame', 'astounding', 'visual', 'flare', 'camera', 'out', 'surroundings', 'beautiful', 'precision', 'Just', 'watch', 'fog', 'scene', 'Darcy', 'know', 'picture', 'thousand', 'words', 'graceful', 'mesmerizing.The', 'film', 'love', 'affair', 'lack', 'there', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'pair', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'heaven', 'strong-willed', 'opinionated', 'seem', 'butt-heads', 'more', 'steal', 'hearts', 'end', 'denying', 'are', 'perfect', 'one', 'What', 'movie', 'so', 'brilliant', 'affect', 'catalysts', 'almost', 'other', 'love', 'story', 'there', 'two', 'characters', 'seem', 'pop', 'up', 'almost', 'teen', 'film', 'produced', 'late', 'are', 'originals', 'splendid', 'performances', 'Knightley', 'Macfadyen', 'are', 'so', 'effortless', 'uplifting', 'impish', 'immaturity', 'breathe', 'whole', 'new', 'life', 'classic', 'tale.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'hold', 'weight', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'likes', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Elizabeth', 'father', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'who', 'mother', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'few', 'moments', 'screen', 'time', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourg', 'such', 'ferocity', 'confrontation', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'highlight', 'film', 'me.In', 'end', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'single', 'flaw', 'Watching', 'Keira', 'chew', 'up', 'scenery', 'orgasmic', 'especially', 'when', 'think', 'same', 'girl', 'who', 'pirates', 'hunts', 'criminals', 'action', 'hero', 'exterior', 'giggly', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'so', 'real', 'audience', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'madly', 'love', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'wonder', 'film', 'beautifully', 'magnificent', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'nothing', 'joy', 'warmth', 'heart.So', 'guess', 'do', 'know', 'why', 'love', 'film', 'go', 'figure']",N/A

640449,A3IYP3MS6N8ZKV,B00005JOHI,Andria Redlin,"[16, 23]","I have only read the book one time, after getting completely hooked on the 1995 A&E; version of Pride and Prejudice and watching it about six times this year alone, so I am probably not the most qualified person to write my objections to the 2005 piece of filth, but after reading what everyone else had to say, I could not keep silent either. Here are my objections as follows:1. Kiera Knightley- Hollywood clearly cannot tell the difference between a great actress better suited to the role of the intelligent Elizabeth Bennett (as in, almost anybody but K.K.) and a walking, talking, beanpole who claims to have read the book, but I don't think she did because if she had she would not have fudged this role up so badly with all the excessive giggling, outspokenness to her parents that was more or less non-existant during that time period, and for goodness sakes, somebody tell her to please close her mouth. Sexiness is appropriate in modern-day romantic comedies, but NOT in period pieces such as this one, or at least not the kind K.K. displayed. A woman from that time certainly did not run around outside with her hair down, or in her nightgown, and they almost never went outside without a hat or bonnet of some sort, which, I can't recall seeing K.K. wearing one, even after forcing myself to watch this film three times. Also, somebody please tell that girl to eat once in a while! I find it hard to believe that somebody from that time period, who did no housework and clearly had time to kill by making the audience sick by spinning on a swing, could be that skinny, when a typical daily diet from back then included a great consumption of whole milk, cheese, butter, bread, and eggs. Fattening fare that would have made a person look at least healthy, not like somebody who had not even seen puberty. Kiera Knightley was totally wrong for that role, having too modern of a face, and too thin a figure. I'm sorry Kiera, but you should stick with modern flicks. As a final irritation on this subject, I might add that she rattled her lines off so fast in some scenes that I hardly knew what she said, which is pretty sad for a person like me who is more than familiar with the dialogue. I believe that in a film with language that is as old as this, the lines should be spoken more slowly, to give our modern minds time to translate and understand what was said.2. Fitzwilliam Darcy- I felt absolutely nothing for this film's portrayal of the character whatsoever. There was nothing in him that made him the least bit likeable or desireable, and that haunted look that was constantly plastered to his face just depressed me.3. Charlotte Lucas- '""Don't judge me, Lizzy!""' Pul-eeeze. The film portrayed Charlotte's acceptance of Mr. Collins as being that she was unhappy to be marrying him, like she was trapped. In the book, she was actually in persuit of a comfortable home, and wasted no time in securing Mr. Collins for herself, even though he was not necessarily her first choice. But being older than the typical marrying age back then, beggars cannot be choosers, as the saying goes, and she may have become one eventually had she remained a spinster.4. The Costumes- I thought they were completely inaccurate for the time period, and terribly boring and colorless, especially the one Knightley wore in her first scene. Yuck, and I don't know what was up with her hair, but it just did not go with her modern-looking face. Speaking of hair, I didn't know that Marie Antoinette was cast to play Lady Catherine de Burgh. And could anybody honestly tell Lydia and Kitty apart with their identical pigtail/ringlet combinations?I honestly do not know how in the world this movie received four stars from the critics, who quite obviously have never read this book. I am sorry for the hordes of disappointed fans out there who were expecting something great (as I did), only to get spoon-fed this '""barely tolerable""' adaptation, only to choke on it after the credits rolled. Congratulations Hollywood, on ruining yet another (what could have been a) great film (just like Eragon got ruined) by attempting to 'modernize' it and change it to what you think the audience would want. Well, if it isn't broken, don't fix it! This is one of those stories in which everything was perfectly fine just the way it was. But (surprise!) some idiot out there had to open their mouth and suggest 'changes.' Well, would it be too much of a 'change' to get it right? If you are watching Pride and Prejudice for the first time, watch the A&E; Firth and Ehle version. I haven't seen the one that was made in the 1980's yet, but I am willing to bet that it totally blows away the 2005 version.Anecdote: I eventually did view the 1980's version of Pride and Prejudice, and it WAS way better than the 2005 version!

The classical music score is so soothing and perfectly suits the story. The whole movie gives you a sense of life with the Bennets that is so real. They are a family whose quirks and charms are immediately evident, and you fall in love with them all. I like that the Bennetts house is so well lived-in and even a little dirty looking. There is a lovely contrast between their poorer household to the richer settings of Mr. Bingley's temporary residence and especially Mr. Darcy's home at Pemberly.Keira Knightley is such a wonderful Elizabeth Bennett. She is natural and witty and somewhat angelic, but she's still a little rough around the egdes and down to earth. I like how she seems silly at times but still knows how to conduct herself properly without coming off as a snob. She's confident but still maintains an innocent quality.Matthew Macfadyen is the hottest Darcy to walk the planet, in my opinion. At first, I wasn't sure about him, because he looked so much like a sourpuss when he made his entrance to the film, but, as his character transforms, he becomes more handsome and eventually just completely sexy - this is where I can see why Jane Austen first titled the book First Impressions. If that title had stuck, it would certainly still work for this story. All the little nuances of Darcy's - the stolen glances, the tension in his hands, etc. - were all captured perfectly on camera and really brought his secret longing for Elizabeth into focus for the audience.I have to add that there were moments when I wanted to jump through the screen and bite Darcy's bottom lip. For example, the rainy day scene was so intense...if I were Elizabeth, I'd be tempted to just say screw pride, I'm yours! And she almost looks like she will. But seriously...Matthew Macfadyen is exactly how I would want my own Darcy to be. The scene where he walks through the dew-covered field at dawn in his flowing coat and his boots and high-waisted pants, YUM! I'm so glad they kept that shot in real time so the audience can watch every single sway of his hips. Wow. Oh, and this is my favorite line of his, ""You have bewitched me, body and soul."" Who talks like that anymore?! I love it!I like the BBC version...Colin Firth is such an awesome, sexy Darcy, too, and now we have this modern, more sexually tense P&P.; Wow, two great P&P; versions, Austen fans should rejoice about that!",5,"Amazing...and another hot Darcy!

However, it's really not necessary.But why choose?  Sure, they took liberties with this adaptation, but to me that makes sense -- it was the only direction to go after the definitive ""traditional"" rendition with the gorgeous BBC miniseries.  They did it all beautifully in that one.The 2005 version, it's grittier, faster, a little more brutal and sad too. I personally loved it -- it's fresh and fast and a new and lovely view of the story.  It's surprisingly swift-moving, very energetic, and a gorgeously made movie.  The acting is superb and the writing is great. It is not paced at all the way you expect these things, and I love the fact that (thanks to a few liberties with the book's time period) it looks and feels somehow very vibrant and real and just a little grungy.  The homes, the clothes, everything looks so real and lived-in (not frilly and clean and perfect the way these things usually are).  Even the dashing hero, who is quite hot, has terrible hair. And Kiera Knightley, who is not always a favorite of mine, is lovely and wonderful here. In this role, it's believable that (as beautiful as she is) that she is not fashionably beautiful or even noticeable, that her smarts and vivacity would be off-putting.  She is absolutely wonderful here, as is the entire cast (and Donald Sutherland is smashing in a scene very late in the movie as well).And yes, I still love Colin Firth.

Firth is a  handsome man even without saying a word.  Matthew MacSpayden looks like a normal person who could use a haircut.  Then I started googling and reading interviews with the actors and directors and came to an appreciation of this work.  Matthew MacSpayden had not read P&P or seen the BBC version before he played the role.  His Darcy isn't as arrogant as Firth's although he is still proud and prejudiced!  Keira Knightley does a wonderful job.  Her Lizzy is full of energy and life!  The story is not followed EXACTLY as the book was written but I found the differences acceptable and reasonable.  The ending is a little weird---it was written for the American audience apparently.  The directing is fast-paced and dramatic (they had to squeeze the whole thing into 2 hours, unlike the 6 hour mini-series) and I love the music.  Several scenes weren't even planned, they just came about---the solo ballroom scene and the proposal-practicing scene with Darcy and Bingley.

We don't get a sense of the time that has passed during which characters are ruminating on what is happening and their feelings about it. We just get scene by scene thrown at us and we are expected to be carried along and believe it. The cinematography is excellent in many parts. The acting is good, but Keira Knightly always has that smirk on her face and after awhile I wonder why it is there so much. Although she holds her own, I was not always drawn in to her performance...or I was drawn in but wasn't sure what I found there. This definitely had a more romantic and sensual feel that other versions have not. I do wish there had been more build-up of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy that would make their falling in love more believable. I always feel that on Darcy's part there is not enough conveyance of what he is attracted to when he is attracted to justify the passion in the end. I did find Mrs. Bennet to be far less shrill and irritating than in other adaptations which was a big plus. I also liked the character of Charlotte here very well.

I've read the novel twice and seen the A&E; version (which this film is unfairly compared with). Therefore I am fully aware of the story and characters and all that diddle-dee-do. So I guess I can be considered informed of the material and what it is about.Now I should mention to people who have this idea that movies based on books should remain faithful to the point of thinking the source as sacred text: the screenwriter did take liberties with the story. A leap in time here. A missing episode there. A sudden visit here. And a hussy fit there.But it is an ""adaptation"" and not a ""translation"" of the original novel by dear Miss Austen. The changes are not drastically uncalled for. They are actually refreshing. As is the mood that the director (Wright) set for the film. The film moves at a swift pace but the mood is always down-to-earth and emotionally focused. Normally when people do Austen adaptations they have this image of the whole movie being focused around drawing rooms with the etiquettes associated with the Regency period. They put so much emphasis into the details of the setting and situations that they neglect the characters humanity and hope that the actors are up to code. This version actually looked at the material in the opposite direction and focused more on the main characters (especially Elizabeth or ""Lizzy"" as she is well known).Oh well I must talk about the acting. It was good.For more info notice the academy award nomination Keira Knightley received for her portrayal of Lizzy. Even though the Academy Awards relativity to cinematic excellence has lessened, please be assured that the notice placed towards Ms. Knightley's performance was well deserved. The whole cast was pretty good with the other standout being Donald Sutherland. But if I must say something more about Ms. Knightley, it is that she fitted who Elizabeth was as a young opinionated woman. She plays Lizzy with the conviction that I felt was missing in other P&P; adaptations. It one thing to say the lines, it's another to say the lines like it's something you would actually say.This movie puts the ""passion"" aspect into the romance of Austen's creation. A true Romantic (of the literary kind) would think of this adaptation as a triumph. And if dear Miss Austen were alive she would probably giggle (of the hushed kind) with delight at the unabashed joy this movies gives in spades.Well RecommendedNote: For the strict Austen fans who believe that Austen would spin in her grave at the supposed blasphemy of the movie, I will say this. You forget that Miss Austen (the writer of gothic-satire Northanger Abbey) probably did not think so much of herself that she wouldn't have wanted other people to look at her work in different ways. Stop being narrow-minded. Miss Austen wasn't!

Also Brenda Blethyn and Judi Dench portrayed extremelly well their charachters. Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy and Jena Malone as Lydia, Elizabeth's younger sister, are also good. I must say that they all portrayed their charachters with gusto!Dario Marianelli creates a wonderful score wich fits with the rural England scenario. I think - that is my opinion - Dario found a great inspiration on the famous Virginia Astley's 'From Gardens Where We Feel Secure' CD.

640460,A23KZBVCFKW1XS,B00005JOHI,A_Plain_Janeite,"[1, 2]","When I first heard there was going to be another version, my first thoughts were that nothing could top the BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle!  Especially since that one was 5 hrs., and followed the book to the tee!Well, of course the new one was cut down to a measly 2 hrs.!!  Because of the time constraint- they had to rush the story along, almost at a fast-forward pace (or as someone aptly put it: ""didn't allow the story to breathe"").  Surprisingly, I didn't find it that big of an issue.There were a few notable changes however... *SPOILER* First, the part where Mr. Darcy first proclaims his love to Elizabeth is a bit different than it was in the book (the setting that is).  Second, the confrontation between Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lizzy is customized (for the sake of time).  Also, (towards the end) the part where Elizabeth confesses her changed feelings towards Mr. Darcy is different than in the book; and the end was also tweaked a bit.Despite these changes, I think the original story was still able to shine through!For the most part I was pleased with their choice of actors.  Dame Judi Dench was a perfect Lady Catherine; and I really enjoyed Rosamond Pike (as Jane), possibly even more-so than the actress in the '95 version.  Mr. Bingly, a tad naive and silly at times is nonetheless endearing!However, Keira Knightley just isn't selling Elizabeth for me (as Jennifer Ehle did).  I don't sense much emotional depth, or connection in and to her character.  KK's roles- at least the ones I've seen her in- all seem to blend together.As for Matthew Macfadyen, my only experience of him prior to this, was a smaller role in the miniseries based on Anthony Trollope's ""The Way We Live Now"".Instead of coming off quite as cold and haughty as CF's Darcy; Matthew's portrayal gave a somewhat new dimension to this enigmatic character!  He really did a fine job in showcasing the more introverted/introspective side of Fitzwilliam (possibly an INTJ temperament). And truth be told, it was a little too easy to get lost in his ""fine eyes""!  Needless to say, he is now my second favorite ""Mr. Darcy""!  (If you haven't already, check him out in the latest BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens ""Little Dorrit"" - he's absolutely brilliant in his role as ""Arthur Clennam""!)All in all it's a good movie- especially for those who don't have the patience to sit through the 5 hr. one.I'm also really pleased with the ""special edition""!  While there's not a whole lot more DVD extras than on the original; the added book, and soundtrack make the purchase worthwhile!**Last edited 2013**",4,(3.75 Stars) Pride & Prejudice: Revisited & Revised!,1231286400,"01 7, 2009",2009,2604,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'version', 'first', 'thoughts', 'were', 'nothing', 'could', 'top', 'BBC', 'version', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Especially', 'one', 'was', '5', 'hrs.', 'followed', 'book', 'tee', 'Well', 'course', 'new', 'one', 'was', 'cut', 'down', 'measly', '2', 'hrs.', 'time', 'constraint-', 'had', 'rush', 'story', 'almost', 'fast-forward', 'pace', 'someone', 'aptly', 'put', 'did', ""n't"", 'allow', 'story', 'breathe', 'Surprisingly', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'big', 'issue.There', 'were', 'few', 'notable', 'changes', 'however', '*SPOILER*', 'First', 'part', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'first', 'love', 'Elizabeth', 'bit', 'different', 'was', 'book', 'setting', 'Second', 'confrontation', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourgh', 'Lizzy', 'customized', 'sake', 'time', 'Also', 'end', 'part', 'where', 'Elizabeth', 'changed', 'feelings', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'different', 'book', 'end', 'was', 'also', 'tweaked', 'bit.Despite', 'changes', 'think', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'still', 'able', 'shine', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'pleased', 'choice', 'actors', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'was', 'perfect', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Rosamond', 'Pike', 'Jane', 'possibly', 'even', 'more-so', 'actress', ""'95"", 'version', 'Mr.', 'Bingly', 'tad', 'naive', 'silly', 'times', 'nonetheless', 'endearing', 'However', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'just', ""n't"", 'selling', 'Elizabeth', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'sense', 'much', 'emotional', 'depth', 'connection', 'character', 'KK', 'roles-', 'least', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'in-', 'seem', 'blend', 'together.As', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'only', 'experience', 'prior', 'was', 'smaller', 'role', 'miniseries', 'based', 'Anthony', 'Trollope', 'Way', 'Live', 'Now', '.Instead', 'coming', 'off', 'quite', 'cold', 'haughty', 'CF', 'Darcy', 'Matthew', 'portrayal', 'gave', 'somewhat', 'new', 'dimension', 'enigmatic', 'character', 'really', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'showcasing', 'more', 'introverted/introspective', 'side', 'Fitzwilliam', 'possibly', 'INTJ', 'temperament', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'easy', 'get', 'lost', 'fine', 'eyes', 'Needless', 'say', 'now', 'second', 'favorite', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'check', 'out', 'latest', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Little', 'Dorrit', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'role', 'Arthur', 'Clennam', 'good', 'movie-', 'especially', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'patience', 'sit', '5', 'hr', 'one.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'really', 'pleased', 'special', 'edition', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'DVD', 'extras', 'original', 'added', 'book', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'purchase', 'worthwhile', '**Last', 'edited', '2013**']",N/A
640461,A2U549OUP6XJ1B,B00005JOHI,"April79marie ""April79marie""","[21, 29]","I simply love this movie. I also like the BBC version with Colin Firth and J.Ehle but honestly this version is my favourite. Although the adaptation of the novel is not really faithful to the novel(unlike the BBC one) I think that Joe Wright, the director, still did an amazing job by making a two-hour movie with all the major passages of the book. The first thing I noticed about this movie is the unique, wonderful atmosphere that the director and his assistants managed to create, with a beautiful-yet-down-to-earth setting, the movement of the camera (I was impressed by the way the camera moves, turns or follows the characters through the ballroom at Netherfield) the long shots mingling with close-views of the actors. Even the sounds are perfect -you can hear birds singing in the morning, rain pattering down- and just for that, the movie is a pure joy for me because it feels somewhat real. The atmosphere in the Bennett's house is so familiar and pleasant that you feel almost immediately a connection with this family. I just love every moment of the movie, I love the dialogues even if they don't correspond to the ones in the book (the Darcy's proposal is a moment of anthology! as this `lovers' spat'- kind of argument between Darcy and Lizzie gets more and more intense) The pace of the movie is fast, the good thing is that you don't have time to get bored, there is always something going on in every scene, the bad thing is that there are not enough scenes with these wonderful characters and I don't want the movie to end!!!Right from the start, you feel so close to the characters that you don't want to leave them. They seem so alive (Lizzie Bennet has never been so flamboyant!)I couldn't help feeling as emotionally charged as them. All the actors are great, not only the leading ones but also the minor ones: the younger Bennet sisters -Jena Malone is so funny-and R. Pike is perfect as serene, beautiful Jane -.It is a pity though that we don't see some characters like Caroline Bingley or Charles Bingley or Wickham very often.And of course Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen are really perfect for me as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy. Keira Knightley gives energy and a mix of wit and mischievousness to the heroine. MacFadyen's Darcy is different from the book, I grant you, but this shy, love-struck and vulnerable is simply irresistible!! OK, maybe you don't have Colin Firth's wet shirt but you can still see MacFadyen drenched to the skin at one point while he is proposing to Lizzie and he is downright sexy too. Plus, his deep voice gives me the shivers! Knightley and Macfadyen have powerful chemistry, and when Darcy proposes to Lizzie in the rain, you can feel the heat, the passion growing more intense between them. The long stares between them, the way they passionately spar and their near-kisses are so sexually charged that they make me almost swoon with delight. One particular moment that I like too is when he helps her getting into a carriage and by doing so, he touches her hand. This is such a magical moment because it is not something you would do at the time especially when you've just met. And the climactic scene , oh boy, this scene in which Macfadyen appears in the misty dawn, desperately seeking Lizzie is so beautiful and rich with sensuality that it always makes me sigh just as it does Lizzie. At that point, I always feel the urge to tell Lizzie that she would be crazy to say 'no' to him now! I think that for once there is the perfect combination between Lizzie and Darcy: (They are both young), he is shy, reserved and socially ill-at-ease while she is free-spirited, flamboyant, lively, always speaking a mind of her own, and so they seem to complete each other very well.The DVD, the English version,is worth the money because the special features are very interesting and ...there is also THE ALTERNATE US ENDING with the balcony kiss. About this US ending, I still think that they could have made a better scene although it is downright sweet. I can feel that Wright wasn't a 100% behind this last conversation between Lizzie and Darcy. Not that I am really complaining, it is still very nice to see them together one last time. One regret, where are the cut-off scenes? I am probably asking too much since the DVD features are already excellent but I 'd love to see the deleted scenes. And I am sure that Joe Wright must have deleted some scenes... Let's hope that there will be one day a special edition with two DVDs. This 'Pride&Prejudice;'movie has become one of my favourites (I think that I must have seen it 4 times in the movie theater before buying the DVD.)I am definitely a big fan because not only I have the book and the music but I 've also been to England just to visit Chatsworth/Pemberley,the Peak District and Burgley House/Lady Catherine De Bourgh's house!!!",5,This movie has bewitched me body&

Sloan,"[13, 22]","I somehow didn't feel the magic and electricity that I got from the 1995 mini series and Sense and Sensibility; which is a shame because I was all ready to adore this one too.  The reason I loved the mini series is because there was no stone unturned; every nuance of emotion was true to Austen's book. Even the narrations as Elizabeth read the letters. Too much goes on to gloss over the things that make you fall in love with the story.  There is no possible way to get the complete feel of the novel unless you have the time to do so.  Much like the Lonesome Dove mini series.  Although totally different genres, the characters felt real and were full-bodied.  The book had a light air to it much like the novel and the movie/novel Sense and Sensibility although both had their sad moments but I can't say this movie did that for me.The only characters that I thought did complete justice to the novel and the mini series were that of Dame Dench's de Bourgh and Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins. I connected also from time to time with Knightly's rendition of  Elizabeth particularly when she overheard Darcy's opinion of her at the dance. Yet Blethens and Sutherland both of whose acting I adore just missed (more so Donald Sutherland) I don't blame the actors for this, mostly the director.  (I especially didn't care to Jena Malone's rendition of Lydia, which was slyer than it was totally oblivious, immature and childlike).  I just feel that this is such a beloved and full novel that leaving the small things that make it so wonderful isn't as satisfyingI'm far from a novel purist but you just miss so much if all of it isn't shown.  If only Hollywood was brave enough to gamble on making something that length, this may have worked better for me.  But we know that will never happen.  I found it somewhat lacking and far from the BBC mini series caliber.  Maybe the extraordinary classics should all be mini-series.

640466,AGT9G5EOQNW7A,B00005JOHI,A Truly Hopeless Romantic,"[8, 16]","This version has beautiful scenery, costumes, actors and has great film quality! The acting is marvelous. Mr. Dacy does such a wonderful job being tormented inside and portraying that torment without a word, only showing it in his guarded expressions. Lizzie and Jane are both beautiful and great actresses. Mr. Bingly is a bit overly enthusiastic and air headed, but pleasing. It had the potential to be a great version of Pride and Prejudice.....but it wasn't!I was confused most of the time and at the end felt like I was rushed through a beautiful love story. I have been a fan of Pride and Prejudice ever since watching the 1996 version starring Colin Firth and have since watched it so many times I have it memorized! Perhaps that is the problem. The 1996 version was a wonderful story. I always knew what each character was feeling and what was going on. There were no gaps in the story and I fell in love with it. I was excited to learn there was an updated version being released this year because I hoped for a better film quality than the 1996 one. It at least had that much going for it. It was a beautiful picture but with a hurried story. They should have lengthened the film so the viewer knew all the characters and details of the story.

640467,A3W38ZRBHIAW7O,B00005JOHI,"Atticus Finch, Brooklyn","[10, 17]","I was looking forward to this version of my favorite novel because I wanted to see how they would slice it down to two hours runtime.  I was delighted with some of it.  Miss Knightley's performance is quite good and she seems to possess all the fire of Elizabeth Bennet.  Brenda Blethyn and Dame Judy Dench (perfection itself) were also standouts, although Miss Dench's important final scene with Miss Knightley was abridged.  And why does she mention a pretty sort of garden (taken from the novel), when they play this scene inside the house at night?I found quite a few more flaws in the production.  The best dialogue is taken directly from the book.  When Miss Austen speaks, the film and the actors are just fine.  When the dialogue is newly invented, it doesn't seem to fly along.  I found Matthew McFadyen rather wooden and not as attractive as the characters say Mr. Darcy is.  Also, the family relationships are not correctly delineated as Miss Austen wrote them.  In the novel, Mr. Bennet favors Elizabeth for her wit.  Of all his daughters, she is the only one, he confides in the book, that he can converse with on an intelligent level.  Also, Lydia (in the novel) is an exact replica of her mother -- which is not apparent in this film.  Also, Mrs. Bennet favors Lydia above her other daughters in the book.  This is nowhere apparent in the film.  It seems that the daughters are all lumped together as one by their parents.  Mr. Bennet's financial concerns are barely brought to light and Lydia's scandalous elopement with Wycham, which is so important to the denoument, is reduced to little more than a trifling matter and is over with in less than three to four minutes.  The ending is like a fast-forward (obviously they were running out of time), and we get a tacked on coda that has Darcy and Elizabeth at Pemberley in a love scene.  Miss Austen's ""psychology"" is missing nearly throughout this film.The DVD supplies us with the actors being interviewed as well as screenwriter and director, and here is where we find where they went wrong.  It seems that all of the information they are giving us is not at all what Miss Austen intended.  Donald Sutherland himself (Mr. Bennet), constantly speaks of how much his character loves his daughters.  Maybe he should try re-reading the book.  Mr. Bennet spent nearly all his time in his library wishing to be undisturbed by the noise of his wife and the household in general.I am forever grateful to the BBC for having taken the novel, one of the finest in the English language, and giving it the royal treatment in 1995 with superlative actors and a screenwriter who knew how to aptly recreate Miss Austen's world.  How fastidious they were with every detail and Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth seem to be the quintessential leading players in this beautiful production.  We have it for as long as DVDs and film last.This new production, even though it is sliced down, seems slow, oddly enough, and I could not wait for it to be over.

Vegan,"[6, 13]","Firstly, if you have already seen the Pride and Prejudice miniseries with Colin Firth, don't expect too much from this movie or you will be disappointed, as I was.It seemed that the dialogue was ""dumbed down"" for the general audience.This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever filmed and if Jane Austen were alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the film. Austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy.  If one is making a period movie, one must be true to the period. The best thing that can be said about this film is that it contains many pretty scenes of the English countryside.I guess the main flaw of this new version is Darcy himself, a role played by Matthew MacFadyen. In the story he is rather dull and generally uninterested in what's going on. It must be difficult to replace Colin Firth as leading man and the Darcy of the miniseries of course had more screen time to show his inner struggle. But the new Darcy is so dull that frankly you don't care if he ends up winning Elizabeth's heart or not. There is absolutely no spark between Knightly and MacFadyen. At the end of the move they don't even kiss and as an audience you couldn't care less.I don't recommend this movie to anyone.

640473,A2GJJFVISJ2XPA,B00005JOHI,A. Zinner,"[3, 5]","The acting in this version is wonderful and spot on. To begin  Jane and Mr Bingley are a perfect fit for their characters and each other. Both actors show a goodness and quietness in their manners so that one has trouble imagining them together and the issues that this couple faces along the way. The biggest issue no doubt is sharing their heartfelt emotions and love for each other.Elizabeth and Mr Darcy are also a perfect match. Elizabeth is just the right amount of independence and vulnerability that her character comes alive. Elizabeth shows that she is sensitive to others opinions, as when Darcy comments on her appearance and behavior at village dance, after his cutting comments she seeks out her best friend to help confirm her beliefs that he is wrong and has a great prejudice. She assumes and exhibits an attitude that she has everything figured out and as a result judges things much to quickly - including Darcy. The development of the character throughout the movie is played so expertly! You really do see her character grow and her opinions rendered incorrect - she too has prejudices.To me this is the best acting of Mr Darcy's character that I have seen. I found it easy to see the shyness in Darcy hiding behind his pride. To me I found this portrayal so right on with what I imagined in from the book. He is quiet and aloof, yet you find yourself drawn to him, much like Elizabeth does as she gets to know him. Darcy does not seem as harshly played in this production as he is in others. It is not as hard to imagine Elizabeth falling for him as in other films. In other productions his change from ""bad"" guy to ""good"" guy seems too fast, here the character has time to grow and we see glimpses of his true self - small in the beginning and then revealed more throughout the film.The scenery of the English Countryside from the village to the residences is beautiful - with incredible scenic shots that will make you want to pick up and move directly to the English countryside.The costumes are simple for the country ladies - One of the greatest examples is the scene in which Elizabeth comes to check on her ailing sister Jane, at the Bingley residence. Elizabeth appears as if she has had a terrible journey to arrive there. Standing in front of the proper ladies and Darcy she is a sight to behold - and so believable.This is definitely worth purchasing and if you love Jane Austen's works or simply a good period piece you will no doubt return to this film again and again.In a word beautiful.",5,Great Acting Classic Story,1239840000,"04 16, 2009",2009,2524,"['acting', 'version', 'wonderful', 'spot', 'begin', 'Jane', 'Mr', 'Bingley', 'are', 'perfect', 'fit', 'characters', 'other', 'actors', 'show', 'goodness', 'quietness', 'manners', 'one', 'trouble', 'imagining', 'together', 'issues', 'couple', 'way', 'biggest', 'issue', 'doubt', 'sharing', 'heartfelt', 'emotions', 'love', 'other.Elizabeth', 'Mr', 'Darcy', 'are', 'also', 'perfect', 'match', 'Elizabeth', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'independence', 'vulnerability', 'character', 'alive', 'Elizabeth', 'sensitive', 'others', 'opinions', 'when', 'Darcy', 'comments', 'appearance', 'behavior', 'village', 'dance', 'cutting', 'comments', 'out', 'best', 'friend', 'help', 'confirm', 'beliefs', 'wrong', 'great', 'prejudice', 'attitude', 'everything', 'figured', 'out', 'result', 'judges', 'things', 'much', 'quickly', 'including', 'Darcy', 'development', 'character', 'movie', 'played', 'so', 'expertly', 'really', 'do', 'see', 'character', 'grow', 'opinions', 'rendered', 'incorrect', 'too', 'prejudices.To', 'best', 'acting', 'Mr', 'Darcy', 'character', 'have', 'seen', 'found', 'easy', 'see', 'shyness', 'Darcy', 'hiding', 'pride', 'found', 'portrayal', 'so', 'right', 'what', 'imagined', 'book', 'quiet', 'aloof', 'yet', 'find', 'drawn', 'much', 'Elizabeth', 'know', 'Darcy', 'not', 'seem', 'harshly', 'played', 'production', 'others', 'not', 'as', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Elizabeth', 'falling', 'other', 'films', 'other', 'productions', 'change', 'bad', 'guy', 'good', 'guy', 'too', 'fast', 'here', 'character', 'time', 'grow', 'see', 'glimpses', 'true', 'self', 'small', 'beginning', 'then', 'revealed', 'more', 'film.The', 'scenery', 'English', 'Countryside', 'village', 'residences', 'beautiful', 'incredible', 'scenic', 'shots', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'pick', 'up', 'move', 'directly', 'English', 'countryside.The', 'costumes', 'are', 'simple', 'country', 'One', 'greatest', 'examples', 'scene', 'Elizabeth', 'check', 'ailing', 'sister', 'Jane', 'Bingley', 'residence', 'Elizabeth', 'had', 'terrible', 'journey', 'arrive', 'there', 'Standing', 'front', 'proper', 'ladies', 'Darcy', 'sight', 'behold', 'so', 'believable.This', 'definitely', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'love', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'works', 'simply', 'good', 'period', 'piece', 'will', 'doubt', 'return', 'film', 'again', 'again.In', 'word', 'beautiful']",N/A

640475,A1PFRFGX0SXSKZ,B00005JOHI,"baltimore0502 ""Hon!""","[21, 28]","Okay, I was VERY skeptical of this remaking of P&P.; First off, feature films rarely do a good job of interpreting a book into a 2 hour film (I thought Zefferelli's Jane Eyre was just dreadful!). I also questioned the casting of Keira Knightley as one of literature's most beloved heroines, Elizabeth Bennett. I really didn't think she could pull it off. But she really did.I'm one of those fans that hold up the BBC/A&E; mini-series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as the gold standard as adaptations go. It wasn't perfect, but it was the best I'd seen to-date and I treasure my DVD copy. And so, it was with fairly low expectations that I went to see this film. But I must say that I was pretty impressed. The setting, as others have pointed out, was of a much more rural world where people got dirty and farm animals wander about in the front yard. I thought the depictions of the Bennett sisters were well done particularly Jena Malone's silly Lydia, Rosamund Pike just luminescent as Jane and Ms Knightly's fine job as Elizabeth. Brenda Blethyn was a much less flighty Mrs Bennett from the BBC version which was welcome. But I was not that wild about Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Mr Bennett. He seemed more willfully neglectful of his daughters than the more benign neglect depicted in the BBC version.As for the men, I know that for many Colin Firth IS Fitzwilliam Darcy (he's played him twice after all) but I found Matthew MacFadyen's portrayal more nuanced and sensitive, almost vulnerable than the more cool and haughty Firth version. I loved him! MacFadyen interprets Darcy's reserve not as superior hauteur so much as a sort of shyness. MacFadyen's Darcy seems to be a shy man who is uncomfortable with strangers and, perhaps, in his own skin. He's attracted to Elizabeth because she is everything he's not. She's totally comfortable with who she is and her place in the world even if she is often stifled by the social strictures of her day. Charles Bingley was portrayed as a boyish innocent and one could see why Darcy felt he had to look out for him. I really felt that the Caroline Bingley character was pretty inconsequential seemingly only there to give Jane the excuse to visit. But one never got the impression that Caroline even liked Jane in this version so that part was not very well done. I must confess that the portrayal of Mr Collins had me smiling with serious bemusement! He wasn't the buffoonish comic relief so much as a bit of an oddity! But the biggest surprise was what a small part George Wickham played in this story.And that is my biggest issue with the film. Other than Mr MacFadyen, Ms Knightly is the star around which everyone else orbits and as a result, everyone else comes off as fairly minor secondary characters. As expected, some events are missing or time periods compressed to fit the time requirements of the film. I suppose it's as faithful as a feature film could be, but it does sort of boil the book down to just the romance between Lizzie and Darcy. Other issues I had were some of the costuming which would have been inappropriate at the time. The almost slip dress that Caroline Bingley wears to the Netherfield ball would have been positively scandalous in the day (a night gown would have shown less skin!). And gloves would have been worn by both ladies and gentlemen at any social occasion. And there was also a scene where Lizzie and her sister are shopping in the village and her hair is down around her shoulders. A young lady of the day would never appear in public without her hair being put up! And I was very disappointed in the lackluster Lady Catherine DeBurgh this version offered.

The above line, the last in the movie, I sincerely hope is from the book. It's so perfect. But of course, you have to know how it came to be so perfect, don't you?Keira Knightley is a beautiful woman, a superb actress, and could probably make any role a fine thing. But this is only the beginning. I love period pieces with great costumes and sets, and the old-fashioned dignity of the King's English, and those lush landscapes. And I do love Jane Austen. This movie not only has all that, but some sweet special touches, like Donald Sutherland in a role unlike any he has ever played before, with gentle humor and just exactly what's wanted in the father of five girls.The humor is gentle all through this movie, such as when the two oldest sisters giggle together under the covers over their reactions to the gentlemen at the rustic country ball. The contrast when an elegant upper crust ball is later held so gently illustrates that only those two eldest girls have the kind of class required to be at home in both circles. Yes, their mother is ridiculous, but she loves her girls sincerely, and did not manage to ruin their chances by being rather too obvious in attempting to marry them off.There are difficulties, of course, but the only tragedy comes when the youngest sister proves too eager to be married and runs off with a soldier.

The miniseries from the mid 1990s with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle was fantastic too, with Firth as a perfect a Darcy as could be, and the whole thing capturing the spirit of the book. I heard a couple rave reviews of this adaptation, so I thought I'd check it out. Let's just say I want my two hours back. It's horrible. It's chopped way down so you just get a shell of the story, perhaps a cliff's notes version. You know what's going on, but you never get much of the wit and development. I didn't give a damn about any of the characters, like I did in the book and the miniseries. In those I was falling for Mr. Darcy right along with Elizabeth and wanting them together. In this version the characters just don't come to life. I didn't care what happened. And on top of that, despite the editing down of a classic to bare bones story, they still tossed in a lot of filler, lots of shots with some piano music tinkling away, and it's like, you couldn't have put a few more good lines of dialogue, explain more of the goings on? Anything? It just doesn't capture the spirit of the book; it's a lazy man's Austen. Bridget Jones' Diary (the movie, anyways, I didn't read the book), better caught the spirit of 'Pride and Prejudice,' with Firth as Darcy  (naturally) and Hugh Grant as Wickham, the crazy mom being the crazy mom with a bit of Lydia's drama thrown in. Rent that instead if you want a lighter version, or give the book and the miniseries a chance.

I have seen other P&P; films in the past, and the one that blew me away was the 1996 A&E; version. This new film doesn't measure up.1) Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle defined the story's characters beyond belief; in fact, the whole cast was superior (you felt as if Jane Austen's characters jumped off the pages). There was chemistry, subtlety, passion, etc. Here, the characters seemed undeveloped/undimensional and lacked all the qualities of the book's characters.2) The length of the 1996 movie gave a lot of detail and was well-developed; the story made much more sense in terms of why and how everything was happening. Here, they just took out all the main parts from the plot and pasted them together, leaving you to wonder if more was supposed to happen. Also, in the 1996 movie, Elizabeth and Darcy saw each other quite often, and each interaction contributed to the overall progression of their relationship; you can see why Elizabeth disliked Darcy and how she slowly started changing her mind. Here, one minute she hates him, and then, after hearing a couple of nice sentences from people, she, all of a sudden, ""magically"" loves him. The two characters barely saw each other and have not even held a real conversation, except for the scene where Darcy makes his first proposal, and is turned down, yet they somehow fell madly in love with each other...?3) 1996: Manners, etiquette, and traditions of the elite British class were captured quite well. You really saw how courtship was intended to be, and how marriage was looked upon. Here:too much Americanization going on (""Hollywood BS"" I call it!). Certain parts were ridiculous (Lady Catherine's night visit, Mr.Bennett's dialogue, Charles Bingley's moron personality, Elizabeth's nightgown run, and the list goes on.......)Basically, a bunch of Americans (with exceptions, of course) pretending to know about British culture.I could go on forever with a list of complaints, but I don't want to bore the readers! If you're going to make a romantic film, make it about anything else, but don't take a classic novel and pretend that you can pull it off with good cinematography.Overall, if you have no idea what the book is about and have never read it (like this version's filmmakers), you might enjoy see this P&P; movie because it's a ""romance"".

On the other hand, Wright's Lady Catherine seems overblown though in the capable hands of Dame Dench, and Donald Sutherland's physicality doesn't quite fit Mr. Bennett though he does capture the character's charm & sense of humor.Wright's costuming & sets were well researched exemplified by older women wearing less fashionable gowns and younger women dressing more stylishly within their particularsocial rank.

But then I thought about the movie itself and how I felt swept up in it while it played in front of me.

In this year of surprisingly strong performances that seem to come out-of-nowhere, Keira Knightley achieves the nearly impossible by making the role of Elizabeth Bennet entirely her own.

It is also my favorite Jane Austin book and movie and series.  It is set at just about the turn of the century in around 1800.  It must have been a naughty kind of a read because Austin really does use the book to poke fun at the Aristocracy and the way they turn their noses down at everyone.  There is one slightly superior BBC version made up of several episodes where the young lady who played Elizabeth is just as pretty as Keira Knightly with long and beautiful black hair and an ivory complexion, but I so enjoyed this one too.  How indifference becomes irritation and then almost hate before we see an perfect partner as who he or she really is must be the most endearing story of romance.  They each see a reflection of each other in their stubborn pride and it's what each dislike about themselves.  Well, they have to get over that because there is a lot they share in common.  Darcy is very handsome, but shy.  Elizabeth is very beautiful and used to speaking her mind.  Her father encourages that a great deal.  Her mom is pushing all the girls to get married and Elizabeth will not be married just to obtain a better station in life for herself.  The poor and lower aristocracy is represented in the Bennetts with Elizabeth as one of many daughters.  They are intelligent and spirited and have a good opinion of themselves.  Mr Darcy and his friend Mr. Bingley come to stay in their own grand homes.  They are high aristocracy.  Can rich fall in love with poor? Does wealth matter very much when love is what matters.

I do believe that anyone viewing either of these two fine films must judge them as such instead of comparing the two.I will admit that this version has proven to be a favorite of mine between the two (I watch it at least once a week - gotta have my dose of Darcy *grin).  For one, this version was more ""romantic"" to me - Darcy helping Lizzie into the carriage, Darcy watching Lizzie on the ballroom floor, etc.  This really assisted in making Darcy's sudden proposal to Lizzie more believable whereas in the A & E version (not comparing, merely pointing out) - I was surprised by the declaration of love because I didn't see it coming.  There were no obvious signs that Darcy held any affections for Lizzie other than an occassional glance here and there.  In short, Firth and Eahle lacked the chemistry that Knightley and McFayden had in this version of the film.  Although I absolutely adore Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy - it took me a minute to warm up to him as he initially came off as a snob.  Matthew Macfayden portrays Darcy as more of a man who although he possesses great wealth, he lacks simple social skills.  I fell in love with the sweetness of his face and the scene with him walking across the field as his long coat blows in the breeze accompanied by that gorgeous music...*fanning self frantically  His walk, his voice, and his magnificent physique combined have made me stand up and unashamedly declare that MATTHEW MCFAYDEN IS ""THE"" MR. DARCY!!!Also, the fact that this film was slightly over 2 hours as opposed to the other, longer versions of the story was a definite plus to me.For those reviewers who wish to harp about the clothing being wrong for the time period or certain behaviors being unacceptable and unheard of for that era...give it a rest, please!  I am an avid reader of historical romances and an avid viewer of period pieces, most with romantic themes, and I'm here to tell you that when I'm in the mood for a good romance - I could care less if the heroe's cravat is knotted incorrectly for that time of the evening during that particular time period - I'm more concerned with a good romance!  And this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" delivers just that!  A beautiful and romantic tale!  Now if Mr. Darcy had decided to deal with Lizzie's rejection by flopping in front of the t.v. to watch reruns of ""The Golden Girls"" I might have had issues.  *laugh  You get my point though - those details are minor.  In the end, it's the story that counts.I would DEFINITELY recommend to anyone looking for a sweet romance and a wonderful film.p.s. I mistakenly hit four stars when I meant to hit five!

640497,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JOHI,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[8, 14]","Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice has been translated to film several times now - from Robert Leonard's 1940 ""attempt"" starring Laurence Olivier, to the 1980 and 1995 TV miniseries', and now on to a new theatrical release here. Having read the book and seen all of these adaptations, I feel I can comment objectively on what does and doesn't work with regards to director Joe Wright's newest version.Let's start with the positives. It's beautifully filmed (from gnarled old trees to stunning sunsets against old English mansions) and the cast performs well. I even liked Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods, FOYLE'S WAR TV series) and the rest of the actors. They seemed to be able to grasp the internal dynamics of their respective characters and pulled in fine performances. Keira Knightley (BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, 2002) does a good job as Lizzie Bennett but appears upbeat far too often during a time when love and loss went hand in hand. Matthew Macfayden (WUTHERING HEIGHTS TV series) does an admirable Mr. Darcy but being up against a giant of the English acting world from a previous adaptation made his character representation a bit tougher when it came to comparisons.Now let's get into my main problem: the pacing. I usually don't mind fast-paced films, but Jane Austen's book is anything but quick (checking in at around 500 pages depending on which publisher you choose). Books of this size tend to be difficult to translate to the silver screen (or TV) because of their scope, and this was the big ""ouch"" for this film. Clocking in at 129 minutes, condensing the book in such a drastic manner meant clipping out chapters and causing a bit of confusion. The confusion comes from the lack of understanding a new viewer might have IF they've never seen any of the previous TV/movie versions or IF they've never read the novel. When Lydia runs off with ""the wrong man"" it is a vital portion of the story that is only touched on and could seem disorienting to the new Pride and Prejudice viewer. We never see what happens to Lydia in London, nor do we see the wedding and where Mr. Darcy's pressure exerts itself.Comparisons will obviously be made between this theatrical release and the 1995 miniseries (which many, including myself, feel is the penultimate adaptation of Mrs. Austen's book). Some might complain that it isn't fair to make such comparisons because one was designed for television while the other was meant for theater. I'll grant that. But with the lengthy films that've come out of Hollywood lately (Lord of the Rings, King Kong, etc.), I don't feel that this new version would've suffered in the slightest by lengthening its running time and thus adding a better sense of coherency to many of the side stories. The 1995 miniseries also had an incredible benefit in that Mr. Darcy was played by the estimable Colin Firth (SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, 1998), and it is THIS Mr. Darcy that many hold as the high standard for such work. Try putting Matthew Macfayden up against Mr. Firth and you'll see what I mean; there's just no comparing them.I did give this film a positive review because a) I liked the cinematography, and b) the acting was generally well done. But for emotional impact and excellent character portrayals look to the 1995 miniseries.",4,A Good (Not Great) Adaptation,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,3261,"['Jane', 'Austen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'been', 'translated', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'now', 'Robert', 'Leonard', '1940', 'attempt', 'starring', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', '1980', '1995', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'now', 'new', 'theatrical', 'release', 'here', 'Having', 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'adaptations', 'feel', 'can', 'comment', 'objectively', 'what', ""n't"", 'work', 'regards', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'newest', 'version.Let', 'start', 'positives', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'gnarled', 'old', 'trees', 'stunning', 'sunsets', 'old', 'English', 'mansions', 'cast', 'performs', 'well', 'even', 'liked', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'Simon', 'Woods', 'FOYLE', 'WAR', 'TV', 'series', 'rest', 'actors', 'seemed', 'be', 'able', 'grasp', 'internal', 'dynamics', 'respective', 'characters', 'pulled', 'fine', 'performances', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'BEND', 'IT', 'LIKE', 'BECKHAM', '2002', 'good', 'job', 'Lizzie', 'Bennett', 'upbeat', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'time', 'when', 'love', 'loss', 'went', 'hand', 'hand', 'Matthew', 'Macfayden', 'WUTHERING', 'HEIGHTS', 'TV', 'series', 'admirable', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'being', 'up', 'giant', 'English', 'acting', 'world', 'previous', 'adaptation', 'made', 'character', 'representation', 'bit', 'tougher', 'when', 'came', 'comparisons.Now', 'let', 'get', 'main', 'problem', 'pacing', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'fast-paced', 'films', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'book', 'anything', 'quick', 'checking', '500', 'pages', 'depending', 'publisher', 'choose', 'Books', 'size', 'tend', 'be', 'difficult', 'translate', 'silver', 'screen', 'TV', 'scope', 'was', 'big', 'ouch', 'film', 'Clocking', '129', 'minutes', 'condensing', 'book', 'such', 'drastic', 'manner', 'meant', 'clipping', 'out', 'chapters', 'causing', 'bit', 'confusion', 'confusion', 'lack', 'understanding', 'new', 'viewer', 'might', 'have', 'IF', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'previous', 'TV/movie', 'versions', 'IF', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'novel', 'When', 'Lydia', 'wrong', 'man', 'vital', 'portion', 'story', 'only', 'touched', 'could', 'seem', 'disorienting', 'new', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'viewer', 'never', 'see', 'what', 'Lydia', 'London', 'do', 'see', 'wedding', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'pressure', 'itself.Comparisons', 'will', 'obviously', 'be', 'made', 'theatrical', 'release', '1995', 'miniseries', 'many', 'including', 'feel', 'penultimate', 'adaptation', 'Mrs.', 'Austen', 'book', 'might', 'complain', ""n't"", 'fair', 'make', 'such', 'comparisons', 'one', 'was', 'designed', 'television', 'other', 'was', 'meant', 'theater', ""'ll"", 'grant', 'lengthy', 'films', ""'ve"", 'come', 'Hollywood', 'lately', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'King', 'Kong', 'etc', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'new', 'version', 'would', ""'ve"", 'suffered', 'slightest', 'lengthening', 'running', 'time', 'thus', 'adding', 'better', 'sense', 'coherency', 'many', 'side', 'stories', '1995', 'miniseries', 'also', 'had', 'incredible', 'benefit', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'was', 'played', 'estimable', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'SHAKESPEARE', 'IN', 'LOVE', '1998', 'THIS', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'many', 'hold', 'high', 'standard', 'such', 'work', 'Try', 'putting', 'Matthew', 'Macfayden', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Firth', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'just', 'comparing', 'them.I', 'did', 'give', 'film', 'positive', 'review', 'liked', 'cinematography', 'b', 'acting', 'was', 'generally', 'well', 'done', 'emotional', 'impact', 'excellent', 'character', 'portrayals', 'look', '1995', 'miniseries']",N/A

This is occasionally (not always - thus four stars) a visually stunning film, and I don't mean Keira's face (Austen must have rolled over in her grave with that casting.)The version I like to think Jane A. would have preferred is of course the fabulous BBC version with Colin Firth as Darcy, and the wonderful Jennifer Ehle, who was born to play Elizabeth.Anyway, the camera people and the screenplay people made certain moments of this P&P; as visually moving as any I've seen in a long time.  The scene with Liz on the swing as the seasons change; the early morning scene when Darcy and Liz meet in the ...fog; the camera movement at the second ball, the confrontation in the rain; etc., these I could watch a thousand times.  Offsetting these, are the terrible ending, the family scene at the beginning, and several other weak moments (the statue admiration scene at Darcy's mansion...is she staring at what I think she's staring at?!)

But any inspiration was all on Miss Austen's side.  Any movie adaptation must take some artistic license even with a literary classic, but this dreadful production takes too many unforgiveable liberties.  This is for the crowd that reads Austen and thinks, ""Great story, but where's the sex?""The movie goes off course in very basic ways--plot, theme, characters and setting.  The principal characters are prominent people of means.  Why do they all look as though they need a hairbrush and a bath?  Mr. Bennet is a solitary bookworm with an acerbic wit.  How did he become become a disheveled hick?  Miss Austen writes that Elizabeth had a lively air of sportive playfulness that made it difficult for her to offend anybody.  So why are we treated to so many views of Keira Knightley's bared, vampiric teeth as she bites off her sadly abridged lines?  Matthew Fayden is an equally unsatisfactory Darcy, so far removed from the handsome, elegant, arrogance of the original that we keep waiting for the hero to show up and get the story going.  Lady Catherine is all sweaty vitriol, too vituperative to be as ridiculous as she should be.The change of setting to the Georgian period is a poor fit, as is the barnyard the Bennets appear to occupy.  Mr. Bennet is a gentleman, not a gentleman farmer.  The Elizabeth-Darcy romance is better attuned to the early age of romanticism, particularly in the relationship of the characters to nature.  Austen heroines like to be outdoors, and many pivotal scenes take place in a garden.  This aspect was far better treated in the films ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Persuasion,"" and the BBC's Austen productions, which are more appropriately set in the Regency period.Worst of all is that final scene!  Like so many dimwitted authors who spin off Austen's novels into hot steaming garbage, someone tacked a jarring final scene onto this film that feels all the more coarse for bringing such an elegant tale to a tasteless conclusion.  Not that all the scenes that precede it are much better; but they merely distort the story.

640502,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,B00005JOHI,Bookphile,"[9, 14]","I was certain it was impossible to improve upon the BBC's stellar interpretation of P&P.;  I was sure that no one could improve upon Jennifer Ehle and I was certain that Colin Firth was the penultimate Darcy.  This movie proved me wrong.Firstly, I want to address Keira Knightley's interpretation of my all-time favorite literary heroine.  She had the spark and fire and quick wit that is so characteristic of Elizabeth.  I thought her performance was pitch perfect and I give her the edge of Ehle.  While I do really like Ehle's rather more sedate Elizabeth, I really liked Knightley's more impetuous version.  Her outbursts sprang from her with such passion and impatience that I felt she had really nailed the character.As for Darcy, I love Firth's arrogant but socially awkward portrayal.  Because of this, I was glad to see Matthew Macfadyen play Darcy as something of a nerd.  It was an interpretation of Darcy that I'd never pictured but I think it worked splendidly.  Rather than being overtly haughty as Firth's Darcy was, Macfadyen's Darcy was painfully socially awkward and who came across as arrogant because of it.  His Darcy was intensely private and unwilling to give up his family secrets and yet all the more pained for how he knew it made him seem to Elizabeth.The rest of the cast is stellar as well, though I won't go into great depth or I'll risk running on for pages.  I particularly liked Elizabeth's warm relationship with her father and the way his eyes teared over when he wished Elizabeth happiness in her betrothal.  I also liked the way Mrs. Bennett was made more complex and her motivations made more clear.  After all, what did a woman of that social standing have to do other than ensure her daughters made prosperous marriages?  Mrs. Bennett seems so silly until one considers just how stressful it must have been to have to worry about the welfare of so many girls and to be constantly conscious of how quickly they'd sink into poverty and oblivion if their father--the sole breadwinner--were to become ill or die.The film itself is wonderfully layered and I find that with each viewing I see subtle things I had not before noticed.  It certainly bears repeat viewings not just for the wonderful story, gorgeous scenery, and stellar acting but also for the subtle background touches that become apparent once one focuses on them rather than the action occurring in the foreground.  This version is rife with small gestures and looks that speak volumes about what is occurring in the story.

It takes two headstrong people with (very) different backgrounds and throws them together against the backdrop of an over-polite society and social prejudice.Each and every actor in this film is perfect and thoroughly believable.Kiera Knightley, though playing a character with limited opportunity to show her evident quickness of tongue, managed to jut her chin and give back-handed insults just enough to flaunt the independent spirit of Elizabeth Bennet.Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy was an interesting casting choice.  What I particularly like about this man was that he isn't your average pretty boy.  Macfadyen gave the character (and audience) something more than just the gorgeous smile and perfectly placed hair so often seen on Hollywood screens.Rosamund Pike, playing Elizabeth's sister Jane, shone in a supporting role.

I like both the Firth and the Knightley versions. Funny how when we think of the BBC we think more of Mr. Darcy (Firth) and when we think of this one we think more of Elizabeth (Knightley).There are many scenes from each of the P&Ps; that I can say I like over the other, so I can't pick a true favorite version. Even with significant script downsizing and tweaking in this version, overall you still get the many *SIGH* moments between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth and the laugh out loud moments with Mr. Collins (I'm forever a fan of the Hollander actor who played him in this rendition!). You sympathize and adore Charlotte (who is very believable as the plain ""spinster-in-the-making"" than the other versions) and WHO can bring aristocracy to the screen like the dame Judi?  This role was made for her and out of all P&P; ladyships, she is by far my favorite portrayal. I was also happy with the Lydia casting - her portrayal was the perfect comedic silly and selfish.LOVED Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennett!  You get an idea of why they aren't in the best financial shape with his laid back and resigned attitude - the go-getter he is not. The scene between he and Lizzie at the end is very touching.  Any daddy's little girl will be moved when they watch it.  I know I was and still am every time I see it.Matthew MacFayden did a fine job with his portrayal of the handsome and initially stoic and snobbish Mr. Darcy.  I think his emotions and tenderness really trasmitted itself well across the screen as his feelings grew for Elizabeth.  Truly FINE performances from all of the cast.Some have brought up the discrepancies in this P&P;, yet I do not remember Mr. Darcy swimming in a lake and coming out of it sexy and dripping wet in the book like he did in the Firth version - yet we do not complain about it. That's because it was a GREAT scene (for the ladies) and it didn't take away from the movie.  There are going to be changes in each one, as long as it doesn't take away from the romance of the two and the gist of the story (again many only have 2 hours), I think when given a chance, P&P; lovers will really enjoy this one.I would have loved to have seen more effort with the costume designs, but overall I really LOVED the movie and occasionally when I have 2 hours on a rainy day, I'll pop it in.

Here we have a parade of third millennium anachronisms almost as preposterous as those on display in the equally absurd current rendering of ""Tristan and Isolde."" Thus, our heroine Kiera Knightley sails through the whole film with a saucy, feminist tinged, ""cat that swallowed the canary,"" facial expression and vocal delivery, that suggest that she has been watching a great deal of Katie Couric and Elizabeth Vargas, and is dying to drop the word ""empowerment,"" somewhere into her dialogue.Then there's the ""incomparable,"" Judi Dench--(as the publicity breathlessly assures us). For some incomprehensible reason, contemporary casting directors' are under the lamentable delusion that Miss Dench, (like Maggie Smith) is somehow suited to grande dame roles--when nothing could be further from the truth.Having seen Miss Dench on stage in a five hour production of ""Cymbeline,"" at Stratford on Avon, I can personally attest to her range and power as an actress. However, whatever her qualifications for Shakespeare, there is nothing in her appearance or deportment that is remotely aristocratic in the 18th/19th century sense of the term.Indeed, if anything, her persona is pronouncedly proletariat.Add to that her coarse and rubicund complexion, (un-pancaked in the current naturalistic mode) and her Lady Catherine appears more like a refugee from a Hogarthian gin palace than the daunting and imperious creature Miss Austen intended.Martita Hunt where are you now that we need you?There is little to say about Donald Sutherland in the role of Mr. Bennet, inasmuch as he has built a successful career out of being miscast--a feat he continues with this role. And his wife in the picture, (far from the lavender, rose silk and cream Mary Boland of yore) looks like a blowsy, overage bawd from the cast of a backwoods dinner theater production of ""Moll Flanders,"" who has somehow wandered onto the wrong movie set.But mercifully we at length arrive at the priceless (and now requisite) final clinch, where Miss Knightley and Mr. Macfadyen are depicted in the lotus position on a lake in front of their chteau, where they proceed to launch into a demonstration of mutual affection that looks like a TV promo for ""The Bachelor,"" and makes one wonder if Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts are standing just outside of camera range whispering instructions.For now if you absolutely require a filmed alternative to the novel itself--stick with the 1940 Greer Garson or unfairly ignored 1979 British TV version.",2,Woefully miscast !,1150243200,"06 14, 2006",2006,2616,"['example', 'contemporary', 'inability', 'render', 'classic', 'anything', 'original', 'intent', 'sense', 'form', 'Here', 'have', 'parade', 'third', 'millennium', 'almost', 'as', 'preposterous', 'display', 'equally', 'absurd', 'current', 'rendering', 'Tristan', 'Isolde', 'Thus', 'heroine', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'whole', 'film', 'saucy', 'feminist', 'tinged', 'cat', 'swallowed', 'canary', 'facial', 'expression', 'vocal', 'delivery', 'suggest', 'been', 'watching', 'great', 'deal', 'Katie', 'Couric', 'Elizabeth', 'Vargas', 'dying', 'drop', 'word', 'empowerment', 'somewhere', 'dialogue.Then', 'incomparable', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'publicity', 'breathlessly', 'incomprehensible', 'reason', 'contemporary', 'casting', 'directors', 'are', 'lamentable', 'delusion', 'Miss', 'Dench', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'somehow', 'suited', 'grande', 'dame', 'roles', 'when', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth.Having', 'seen', 'Miss', 'Dench', 'stage', 'five', 'hour', 'production', 'Cymbeline', 'Stratford', 'Avon', 'can', 'personally', 'attest', 'range', 'power', 'actress', 'However', 'qualifications', 'Shakespeare', 'nothing', 'appearance', 'deportment', 'remotely', 'aristocratic', '18th/19th', 'century', 'sense', 'term.Indeed', 'anything', 'persona', 'pronouncedly', 'proletariat.Add', 'coarse', 'rubicund', 'complexion', 'un-pancaked', 'current', 'naturalistic', 'mode', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'more', 'refugee', 'Hogarthian', 'gin', 'palace', 'daunting', 'imperious', 'creature', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'intended.Martita', 'Hunt', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'need', 'little', 'say', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'inasmuch', 'built', 'successful', 'career', 'being', 'miscast', 'feat', 'role', 'wife', 'picture', 'far', 'lavender', 'rose', 'silk', 'cream', 'Mary', 'Boland', 'yore', 'blowsy', 'overage', 'bawd', 'cast', 'backwoods', 'dinner', 'theater', 'production', 'Moll', 'Flanders', 'who', 'somehow', 'wandered', 'wrong', 'movie', 'set.But', 'mercifully', 'length', 'arrive', 'priceless', 'now', 'requisite', 'final', 'clinch', 'where', 'Miss', 'Knightley', 'Mr.', 'Macfadyen', 'are', 'depicted', 'lotus', 'position', 'lake', 'front', 'chteau', 'where', 'proceed', 'launch', 'demonstration', 'mutual', 'affection', 'TV', 'promo', 'Bachelor', 'one', 'wonder', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'are', 'standing', 'just', 'camera', 'range', 'whispering', 'instructions.For', 'now', 'absolutely', 'require', 'filmed', 'alternative', 'novel', 'stick', '1940', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'unfairly', 'ignored', '1979', 'British', 'TV', 'version']",N/A

Directed by Joe Wright and screenwritten by Deborah Moggach, this is the most visually arresting and artistic of the ""Pride & Prejudice"" films.  The strength of the other versions has always been the dialogue. This is the first version which trusts the camera and imagery and lets the luminosity of the story line shine through rather than talking straight through it. The actors in this version are also a who's who of British acting. There is the young and impudent incandesence of Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet. She is the prejudiced one against the wealth and position of the young man who initially finds her too inferior to even be his dance partner.  This is Mr. Darcy as played by Matthew Macfadyen.  I was used to him as the head spy on MI-5 so he is maybe the last actor I would have cast as Darcy. However, I didn't realize how versatile an actor he is.  He is fabulous as Darcy, the one who suffers from pride in his origins, his convictions, his family and his property.  Elizabeth is beneath him so how could he fall in love with her?

Shifflett ""cmshifflett""","[8, 27]","Stunning photography and highly imaginative scripting and casting: Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennet) is especially striking in his clear familial and sartorial resemblance to great-great-grandson Buddy Ebson (Jed Clampett), before the family left England (possibly due to some unspeakable behavior involving pigs) and moved to the New World where they acquired more polish and class, rising in American society to the beautiful mountains of Kentucky.The director has wisely smoothed out Austen's complex characters and overly involved plot to a level more suitable to modern sensibilities and tastes; for moderns challenged by the complexities of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" or Harlequin novels, this tender tale provides all the depth, subtlety, and brilliant crafting of a Barbara Cartland Romance.Stars are subtracted from this otherwise lovely film as an issue of Truth In Labeling, with potential confusion to the consumer. It is common for artists producing a work ""Based On"" a classic work (but bearing little resemblance to the original) to give their work a fitting alternate name. For example, a stirring tale ""based on"" ""Homer's Oddysey"" might become ""O, Brother Where Art Thou"" or it might become ""Cold Mountain."" The novel ""based on Jane Austin's ""Emma"" has become ""Clueless"" and her ""Pride and Prejudice"" has become ""Bridget Jones' Diary.""

640527,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00005JOHI,C. B Collins Jr.,"[6, 10]","This is a beautiful version of the classic Jane Austin novel Pride and Prejudice. the actors and actresses are beautiful and the English countryside glows golden at sun rise and sun set. There are three aspects of the film that I will point out tht make it wonderful entertainment.First, Elizabeth Bennett is one of the great characters in English literature. Here she is played as more impulsive than Jennifer Ehle plays the part in the great BBC version. For example, beautiful Kiera Knightley plays Elizabeth as young, playful, and inclined to romance, as evidenced by her reactions to Mr. Darnley at the country house dance at the beginning of the film. Jennifer Ehle pays Elizabeth Bennett as more reserved, more mature, and more sphnix-like. The strength of Elizabeth Bennett is that she is witty, intelligent, considerate, and willing to change her mind. It is this last quality, the willingness to changer her mind, on which much of the film revolves. Elizabeth's first impression of Mr. Darnley was that whereas he was rich and handsome, he was also arrogant and prideful an maybe even a little cruel. Eventually, through a series of mishaps and interactions, she begins to see him differently, seeing his strenghts and compassion and convictions and most of all, his love for her despite the tensions and misunderstandings they undergo.The scene where Darnley proposes to Elizabeth despite his low regard for her wild family and her poverty was wonderfully played in this film, with Kiera Knightley firing back at him that his poorly worded proposal of marriage was the height of insult to her and her family.Yet these two weather this upsetting event and go on to love each other greatly as they further discover each other's best qualities. Isn't this what love should really be about? Shouldn't we move from erotic first impressions to deeper appreciation and understanding of each other?Second, Darnley is well played here. Colin Firth does such an exceptional job in the BBC version that it was hard for me to warm up to another Mr. Darnley, but this actor gives us a version of Darnley that is more mysterious and less aristocratic than the Firth version.Third, Jane Austin creates a charming world full of odd, delighful, endearing, and yet realistic characters. Jane Bennett is the height of beauty and sweetness, no wonder Mr. Bingley falls madly in love. Mr. Bingley is as silly as he is rich, however he is sincere and is a perfect match for Jane. Mr. Bingley's sister is wonderfully played and I loved the line she speaks at the country dance where she wonders when the guests will stop dancing and chase pigs. Lydia Bennett is such an empty headed young women, not realizing how her elopement could ruin the reputations of her sisters. Mr. Collins is such a fool, basing his self worth on the whims of his wealthy benefactor, Lady de Bourge. Judi Dench plays a great angry scheming Lady de Bourge. Mr. Bennett says in the book: ""God placed us here on earth to laugh at our neighbor's folly and for our neighbor in turn to laugh at ours."" This line wonderfully represents Austin's philosophy which she brings to all her characters.The acting is super and truly romantic, the English countryside is beautifuland moody, and the novel actually can be revealed in a short two hours, which I could not believe until I saw it.",4,Very good updated version of a wonderful classic,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,3342,"['beautiful', 'version', 'classic', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'novel', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'actors', 'actresses', 'are', 'beautiful', 'English', 'countryside', 'golden', 'sun', 'rise', 'sun', 'set', 'are', 'three', 'aspects', 'film', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'tht', 'make', 'wonderful', 'entertainment.First', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'one', 'great', 'characters', 'English', 'literature', 'Here', 'played', 'more', 'impulsive', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'part', 'great', 'BBC', 'version', 'example', 'beautiful', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'Elizabeth', 'young', 'playful', 'inclined', 'romance', 'evidenced', 'reactions', 'Mr.', 'Darnley', 'country', 'house', 'dance', 'beginning', 'film', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'more', 'reserved', 'more', 'mature', 'more', 'sphnix-like', 'strength', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'considerate', 'willing', 'change', 'mind', 'last', 'quality', 'willingness', 'changer', 'mind', 'much', 'film', 'revolves', 'Elizabeth', 'first', 'impression', 'Mr.', 'Darnley', 'was', 'was', 'rich', 'handsome', 'was', 'also', 'arrogant', 'prideful', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'cruel', 'Eventually', 'series', 'mishaps', 'interactions', 'see', 'differently', 'seeing', 'strenghts', 'compassion', 'convictions', 'most', 'love', 'tensions', 'misunderstandings', 'undergo.The', 'scene', 'where', 'Darnley', 'Elizabeth', 'low', 'regard', 'wild', 'family', 'poverty', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'film', 'Kiera', 'Knightley', 'firing', 'back', 'poorly', 'worded', 'proposal', 'marriage', 'was', 'height', 'insult', 'family.Yet', 'two', 'weather', 'upsetting', 'event', 'go', 'love', 'other', 'greatly', 'further', 'discover', 'other', 'best', 'qualities', ""n't"", 'what', 'love', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'Should', ""n't"", 'move', 'erotic', 'first', 'impressions', 'deeper', 'appreciation', 'understanding', 'other', 'Second', 'Darnley', 'well', 'played', 'here', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'exceptional', 'job', 'BBC', 'version', 'was', 'hard', 'warm', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Darnley', 'actor', 'version', 'Darnley', 'more', 'mysterious', 'less', 'aristocratic', 'Firth', 'version.Third', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'charming', 'world', 'full', 'odd', 'delighful', 'endearing', 'yet', 'realistic', 'characters', 'Jane', 'Bennett', 'height', 'beauty', 'sweetness', 'wonder', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'madly', 'love', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'as', 'silly', 'rich', 'however', 'sincere', 'perfect', 'match', 'Jane', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'sister', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'loved', 'line', 'country', 'dance', 'where', 'when', 'guests', 'will', 'stop', 'dancing', 'chase', 'pigs', 'Lydia', 'Bennett', 'such', 'empty', 'headed', 'young', 'women', 'not', 'realizing', 'how', 'elopement', 'could', 'ruin', 'reputations', 'sisters', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'such', 'fool', 'basing', 'self', 'worth', 'whims', 'wealthy', 'benefactor', 'Lady', 'de', 'Bourge', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'great', 'angry', 'scheming', 'Lady', 'de', 'Bourge', 'Mr.', 'Bennett', 'book', 'God', 'placed', 'here', 'earth', 'laugh', 'neighbor', 'folly', 'neighbor', 'turn', 'laugh', 'line', 'wonderfully', 'Austin', 'philosophy', 'characters.The', 'acting', 'super', 'truly', 'romantic', 'English', 'countryside', 'beautifuland', 'moody', 'novel', 'actually', 'can', 'be', 'revealed', 'short', 'two', 'hours', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'saw']",N/A

I would recommend anyone unfamiliar with this story to NOT watch this movie first. It is a nice, bite size version that can best be appreciated when watched with a prior understanding of the characters and the story (as it hacks the actual story to pieces). First, of course, see the '95 version (and read the book!).My praise: Artsy, artsy, artsy! If you listen to the commentary, the director really knew the story and was NOT trying to blatantly follow the book (as we all know, that has been done with perfection, so why try?). He was trying to bring fresh thought and feeling to it and, though I don't agree with a lot of the re-writing of the lines, I applaud the way he alluded to the windows being a metaphor for perception, the way the sunrise opened and closed the story, the setting being 100 years prior to the actual setting of the book, the domestic abuse of Lydia by Wickham (which we all suspected), the little character nuances and sub-plots that took place in the background of every scene (you gotta be quick!), and the romance he could achieve with scenery and music, when no action was taking place. Oo! Simply beautiful! So much more than simply telling the same old tale! And the first-proposal scene! Nice!My rant: I felt this version blew thru the actual story perhaps a little too fast. Much of the wit for which Jane Austen is so well known is NOT done justice. Lines from the book which ARE left intact are spewed with little thought or acting, especially in the beginning. Sometimes so fast that, if I wasn't familiar with the dialogue, I would've had no idea what was going on. And character development? What's that?I was not infatuated with Knightley as Miss Lizzy. She lacked the playfulness and intrigue of her character. She had some of the best lines, yet constantly disappointed me in their delivery. Plus, she always looked disheveled and sticky to the touch. And the teeth on Mr. Bennet! Such pearly, straight choppers for a poor man in 1790! They are blinding amidst all the gloom. C'mon makeup guy, try a little harder!However, Macfadyen was wonderful as Darcy and I wish he had more scenes to better explain his character. I feel he could've done it justice. And Lady Catherine? Perfection!I really expected this to throw out ALL the wit and plot and turn this into some sickly, thin love story that would appeal to idiots everywhere (the 2 hours run time scared me). However, it did not. Some wit remained, all the high points were addressed and there was many a scene where Knightley and Macfadyen had fantastic chemistry. In the end, though, it just wasn't there for me. A little cheesy/sappy perhaps.My ideal P&P; would be somewhere between this and the '95 one. I LOVE the romantic artsy-ness this one brings to the table, yet the '95 version is faultless in it's story. Oh well, maybe the next version will be better.Should you buy this one? Of course!

While I realize it's hard to fairly compare the two, due to running time I found to be fair I'd look at a few different things.  After reading the book so many times one comes to know the dialogue and vernacular. I gave allowances for the running time on the former but the slipping in and out of period vernacular on the latter drove me a bit nuts.  Locations beautiful.  Most of the characters well cast. (Mary is the unnattractive sister and a Talulah Riley is very pretty)  Particularly liked Dame Judy Dench as Lady Catherine and Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett.  Also did not like completely deleting characters and changing the dialogue to suit.  Suddenly the Gardiners have no children?  Where was Maria Lucas?  Unmarried ladies of the time did not travel alone. The the turning-point is the trip to Pemberly. Ladies of the time would not be visiting a house touching things.  Yes I know this movie is adapted from the book, but I think I would have given it another star if it stayed truer to the book and the proper behavior of the period.

(I in fact was able to win a French one -- and am so delighted to have the English counterpart!)  The CD is fantastic -- as the Dario Marianelli music is one of the truly magical treasures of the film.  The 1st disc is exactly like the DVD I all ready have with  the director's commentary; conversations with the cast; Jane Austen, Ahead of Her Time; A Bennett Family Portrait; and HBO First Look.  The 2nd has the new features:  1)The Politics of Dating (with a funny comment by Matthew Macfadyen quipping something like, ""I fancy you; here's my number""  and cutting away to a handwritten Fitwilliam Darcy calling card with a number on it. Too funny.Enjoyable.  2)Galleries of the 19th Century which has stills of various art, furniture and fashions.  Interesting.  3)The Stately Homes of P&P; that you can use the interactive map to look at stills of the homes of the movie as well as watch film with interviews and comments about the locations.  VERY good.  4) P&P; Family Tree was something lacking.  Interesting for those that may be new to the story but for me it was just ""filler.""All in all, I am pleased to have it.

640546,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B00005JOHI,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[2, 2]","I finished reading Pride and Prejudice and immediately checked out the Colin Firth BBC series as well as this film from my local library.  I watched this film first since it was only slightly shorter than the BBC series from the mid 90s.The film stays pretty true to the nature of the book, with some few exceptions.  Mainly there are many moments from the book which could not possibly make it into a 2 hour film.  Several characters were cut entirely, such as Maria and Sir William Lucas.  The two visits to Catherine de Bourg's estate were condensed into one.  And there are a few added scenes where the film takes some liberty.  All in all though, the changes made were good for the pace and continuity of the film.  The only odd scene was when Lizzy confronted Darcy about Jane and Bingly and Wickham.  He actually gives half of his response there, then the other half is contained in a letter (like the book). But the half response kind of takes something away from that moment as described in the novel.The acting is very good.  I liked the casting for most of the main characters.  Donald Sutherland was an odd choice, but he worked as Mr Bennett.  Kiera Knightly is very good as Lizzy; she embodies the under appreciated attractiveness that is described in the novel, especially compared to her more obviously and classically attractive sister Jane.  Knightly embodies the fire and the tomboy style of Lizzy's character very well.I am most happy with the actor who played Darcy.  He is very good at the brooding, yet firm resolution of Darcy's character.  He has the tall, rugged handsomeness that Austen describes.The production quality is what I liked about this film over the drab and overly dark (just bad contrast, not anything with the lighting) BBC series.  Where the BBC series looks like a DVD made from one of those VHS dubbing to DVD devices, this film shines with dramatic settings, and quality film making.  Granted they had the budget to do so!  But with great cinematography, a quality soundtrack, and terrific casting, this is easily my favorite Pride and Prejudice adaptation (over the Laurence Olivier film and the BBC series).",5,Review of the film as compared to the novel~,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,2154,"['finished', 'reading', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'immediately', 'checked', 'out', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'BBC', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'local', 'library', 'watched', 'film', 'first', 'was', 'only', 'slightly', 'shorter', 'BBC', 'series', 'mid', '90s.The', 'film', 'stays', 'pretty', 'true', 'nature', 'book', 'few', 'exceptions', 'Mainly', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'book', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'make', '2', 'hour', 'film', 'Several', 'characters', 'were', 'cut', 'entirely', 'such', 'Maria', 'Sir', 'William', 'Lucas', 'two', 'visits', 'Catherine', 'de', 'Bourg', 'estate', 'were', 'condensed', 'one', 'are', 'few', 'added', 'scenes', 'where', 'film', 'liberty', 'changes', 'made', 'were', 'good', 'pace', 'continuity', 'film', 'only', 'odd', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'Lizzy', 'confronted', 'Darcy', 'Jane', 'Bingly', 'Wickham', 'actually', 'half', 'response', 'there', 'then', 'other', 'half', 'contained', 'letter', 'book', 'half', 'response', 'kind', 'something', 'away', 'moment', 'described', 'novel.The', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'liked', 'casting', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'was', 'odd', 'choice', 'worked', 'Mr', 'Bennett', 'Kiera', 'Knightly', 'very', 'good', 'Lizzy', 'appreciated', 'attractiveness', 'described', 'novel', 'especially', 'compared', 'more', 'obviously', 'classically', 'attractive', 'sister', 'Jane', 'Knightly', 'fire', 'tomboy', 'style', 'Lizzy', 'character', 'very', 'well.I', 'am', 'most', 'happy', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Darcy', 'very', 'good', 'brooding', 'yet', 'firm', 'resolution', 'Darcy', 'character', 'tall', 'rugged', 'handsomeness', 'Austen', 'production', 'quality', 'what', 'liked', 'film', 'drab', 'overly', 'dark', 'just', 'bad', 'contrast', 'not', 'anything', 'lighting', 'BBC', 'series', 'Where', 'BBC', 'series', 'DVD', 'made', 'one', 'VHS', 'dubbing', 'DVD', 'devices', 'film', 'dramatic', 'settings', 'quality', 'film', 'making', 'Granted', 'had', 'budget', 'do', 'so', 'great', 'cinematography', 'quality', 'soundtrack', 'terrific', 'casting', 'easily', 'favorite', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'adaptation', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'film', 'BBC', 'series']",N/A

Granted with a listing of solid actors, I did not anticipate it being bad, but instead a bad interpretation of the book (which I have read a couple of times) especially given the time constraints that feature film provides.While the 1995 TV version is quintessential in its adaptation of the text, the 2005 film version in my humble opinion captures the spirit and the raw emotion that although not on public display must have been in the hearts and minds of the central characters.  I guess this is what many folks consider the ""modern edge"" given to this adaptation.  I personally found it refreshing, vibrant and alive.In terms of casting I must start by saying that I loved Keira Knightley's Lizzie - by far the best interpretation of the role.  And despite those who were blown away by the dashing Colin Firth, Matthew MacFadyen did the role of Darcy service.  His performance wonderfully gives perspective and insight into the perceived fastidiousness of the Darcy persona - I felt like in this version I understood where he is coming from.Beyond the two leads, all the supporting characters did a wonderful job.

She has given such an impressive performance in Bend it Like Beckham and Love Actually that it took time to envisage her in the classic role of Elizabeth. Fortunately, the last hour of the movie saw her adding greater depth to her character, making her and Mr. Darcy a charming couple to watch.While the 1940 version revealed a more comical side of the story (such as performances of Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine de Bourg) and the BBC version was graced by the beautiful landscape and the handesome Colin Firth, I would say this one is a well balanced remake. Maybe Elizabeth (Knightley)and Darcy(Matthew MacFaydyen) on their own do not steal the scenes. Yet together they look such an attractive couple. A 20-year-old Knightley has made Elizabeth come alive on screen, intelligent and beautiful. MacFaydyen has also portrayed a handsome and vulnerable Mr. Darcy. Jane was convincingly sweet and uncalculating whereas Donald Sutherland, as the father, gave her daughter away in tears of joy.The superb cinematography, a sense of tension and urgency when Elizabeth discovered how she had wronged Darcy, a quickening of pace made possible by rearranging and rewriting (Alas, a big risk!)of some scenes have all made the movie a delight to watch. Credits must also be given to a more realistic portrayal of the Bennet family. The Bennet sisters' costumes were conspicously plainer than the Bingley's and Darcy's. The extravagant interior design of the grand mansion (Chatsworth) at Pemberly is simply awesome.As a big fan of the previous versions, to be able to finish the movie and still feel good about it, I would say this movie is a successful remake.

Another thing that can happen is filmmakers tend to be too nervous of altering anything that what worked in book format doesn't work as well on film. Hence we get Pride and Prejudice, which looks great, has respectable casting, but unfortunately has poor pacing and its 19th century-esque language.The film centers around the Bennet sisters, most specifically Elizabeth(Lizzy) and Jane. They're all trying to get married, hopefully with someone with a big wallet. Jane ends up meeting someone named Mr. Bingley which takes an awful long time to resolve while Lizzy is in a love/hate mode with Mr. Darcy, a friend of Mr Bingley. The entire rest of the film follows the 2 women trying to get their respective men to marry them while the mom gets frantic about marrying them off.One thing that tends to plague adaptations is trying to match the spirit of the novel a bit too closely without making it work in a film format. As such the book resembles the language from the book, incredibly long and dictionary-laden words are throughout the film, making me ask ""isn't it better to just say 'I hate you' rather than that much words""? Same thing with the modern Romeo and Juliet film except this takes place in its proper time period and still seems odd hearing it.Many actors and actresses seem to only have that in title only, as if they don't actually ""act"" they just do their job without doing much else. Usually they're girls with pretty faces where you watch them in a film and they don't really do much else that makes them memorable, they just read their lines. Look at Al Pacino in Godfather or Peter O' Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, perfect acting but making them transcend just lines on the page. The actresses here do their parts well, with a special nod of course to Keira Knightley who still has some awkwardness but is still capable of making a character believable.It's a period piece so you're going to expect 2 things: beautifully shot and accurate costumes and of course we have both. Colorful sharp cinematography with 18th century style clothes make the film feel believable and accurate. The music also suits the film well, largely piano-based with some orchestration peppered throughout but not enough memorable themes to make me want to buy the soundtrack.If you don't really feel like reading the novel, it's always best to check out this film although it's not exactly need to buy DVD material, unless you're a Jane Austen fan.",3,"3.5; I merely liked it, didn't find it great",1141084800,"02 28, 2006",2006,2579,"['Adaptations', 'are', 'always', 'tricky', 'condensing', 'large', '200-500+', 'page', 'book', 'can', 'lead', 'liberties', 'many', 'events', 'taken', 'out', 'entirely', 'thing', 'can', 'happen', 'filmmakers', 'tend', 'be', 'too', 'nervous', 'altering', 'anything', 'what', 'worked', 'book', 'format', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'Hence', 'get', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'great', 'respectable', 'casting', 'unfortunately', 'poor', 'pacing', '19th', 'century-esque', 'language.The', 'film', 'centers', 'Bennet', 'sisters', 'most', 'specifically', 'Elizabeth', 'Lizzy', 'Jane', ""'re"", 'trying', 'get', 'married', 'hopefully', 'someone', 'big', 'wallet', 'Jane', 'up', 'meeting', 'someone', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'awful', 'long', 'time', 'resolve', 'Lizzy', 'love/hate', 'mode', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'friend', 'Mr', 'Bingley', 'entire', 'rest', 'film', '2', 'women', 'trying', 'get', 'respective', 'men', 'marry', 'mom', 'frantic', 'marrying', 'off.One', 'thing', 'plague', 'adaptations', 'trying', 'match', 'spirit', 'novel', 'bit', 'too', 'closely', 'making', 'work', 'film', 'format', 'such', 'book', 'language', 'book', 'incredibly', 'long', 'dictionary-laden', 'words', 'are', 'film', 'making', 'ask', ""n't"", 'better', 'just', 'say', 'hate', 'rather', 'much', 'words', 'Same', 'thing', 'modern', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'film', 'place', 'proper', 'time', 'period', 'still', 'odd', 'hearing', 'it.Many', 'actors', 'actresses', 'seem', 'only', 'have', 'title', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'act', 'just', 'do', 'job', 'doing', 'much', 'else', 'Usually', ""'re"", 'girls', 'pretty', 'where', 'watch', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'much', 'else', 'memorable', 'just', 'read', 'lines', 'Look', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Godfather', 'Peter', 'O', 'Toole', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'perfect', 'acting', 'making', 'transcend', 'just', 'lines', 'page', 'actresses', 'here', 'do', 'parts', 'well', 'special', 'nod', 'course', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'who', 'still', 'awkwardness', 'still', 'capable', 'making', 'character', 'believable.It', 'period', 'piece', ""'re"", 'going', 'expect', '2', 'things', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'accurate', 'costumes', 'course', 'have', 'Colorful', 'sharp', 'cinematography', '18th', 'century', 'style', 'clothes', 'make', 'film', 'feel', 'believable', 'accurate', 'music', 'also', 'suits', 'film', 'well', 'largely', 'piano-based', 'orchestration', 'peppered', 'not', 'enough', 'memorable', 'themes', 'make', 'want', 'buy', 'soundtrack.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'reading', 'novel', 'always', 'best', 'check', 'out', 'film', 'not', 'exactly', 'need', 'buy', 'DVD', 'material', ""'re"", 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fan']",N/A

640560,A1T17LMQABMBN5,B00005JOHI,CoffeeGurl,"[7, 12]","I am an avid fan of the 1995 A&E;/BBC version of Pride and Prejudice starring Colin Firth.  And so, I had my reservations about giving this one a whirl.  Most of Hollywood's literary adaptations are underdeveloped, underwhelming and downright superficial.  Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow springs to mind.  However, this 2005 adaptation directed by Joe Wright and adapted by Deborah Moggach, while not better than the 1995 version, is definitely more enjoyable than the bunch.  (Warning: there will be more comparisons between this version and the 1995 version.  So, if you're tired of reading comparisons between those two, then I suggest you skip reading this review.)  The cinematography is gorgeous -- the scenery and sets are a major eyeful.  The film direction is one of the best I've seen.  Wright has done a splendid job.  The music score is one of the best I've heard.  I especially love ""Dawn,"" the one played in the beginning of the movie.  It is absolutely beautiful. The wardrobe, however, is a disappointment.  The gowns (more Georgian than Regency) are not appropriate for the time.  Elizabeth Bennet would have never attended the Netherfield ball without wearing gloves and Caroline Bingley's sleeveless slip dress with a plunging neckline is downright anachronistic.  Not only does it look too modern, a noble lady would have never worn such a flimsy gown at a formal ball unless she was some sort of daring widow wanting to cause a scandal.  The gowns Mrs. Bennet and Lady Catherine de Bourgh wore were at least two decades or so out of style.  And I won't even comment on Judy Dench's hairstyle except for one expression: yikes!  That hairdo was fashionable in the 1750s -- at least sixty years before Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice.  The quality of the characterization varies from person to person. I do not like Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet.  Knightley does not show the right amount of sharp wit, intelligence and conflicting emotions that makes Miss Bennet one of the most endearing heroines in literature.  The director concentrates more on Knightley's pretty face than on focusing on the character's complexities.  This Elizabeth is too petulant and giggly for my taste.  Jennifer Ehle had a better grasp of the character.  I did not like Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet.  He comes across more as a cynical, laid-back loner than the sarcastic and witty character in the book, qualities that were passed on to Elizabeth.  (By the way, I found it odd that in this film Mr. Bennet and Lizzy do not have the kind of closeness and affection that is required in their roles.)  Also, his imitation of an English accent is simply awful.  I wish Benjamin Whitrow had been cast in this version as well.  I also liked the actor who played Mr. Collins in the '95 version better than Tom Hollander.  Even though Hollander was wonderful in BBC's Wives and Daughters, I feel he was miscast as Mr. Collins.  The actors who played Mrs. Bennet, Jane, Mr. Bingley, Caroline Bingley, Lydia and Kitty do a good job, but somehow aren't as colorful as the ones in the 1995 miniseries.  And last, but definitely not least, is Matthew Macfadyen as the dark, handsome, proud and brooding Mr. Darcy.I don't think I'm being biased when I say that, while Macfadyen does some wonderful scenes in which Darcy shows his longing for Elizabeth, he in no way outshadows Colin Firth's performance.  Firth was able to transmit Mr. Darcy's complexities and conflicting emotions in almost a flawless way.  He also convinced me that Mr. Darcy was indeed rude and proud, or at least seemed that way from Elizabeth's perspective, and Macfadyen's Mr. Darcy comes across more as shy and awkward than anything else, which would have been fine, but then why would he be so against Elizabeth's poor connections and convince Mr. Bingley that Jane isn't the one for him?  The one thing Macfadyen was able to convey better than Firth was his love and desire for Elizabeth.  (Actually, I thought Firth's subtle approach to Darcy's feelings and sexual tension for Lizzy was more dead on.  Macfadyen's approach is more blatant and in-your-face.)  This film's Darcy appearing without a cravat in the last scenes has a nice, sensual touch, but it's nothing like Firth jumping on the lake and then walking back to Pemberley in wet clothes.  Anyway, as for the rest of the film, due to time constraints, many scenes are glossed over, including the whole Lydia and Mr. Wickham debacle.  In fact, Mr. Wickham, such an integral character in the story, appears only in two or three scenes! There are also some characters that are eliminated altogether, like Mr. Bingley's married sister (who was supposed to be Miss Bingley's chaperone.  Miss Bingley would have never stayed at a house alone with two single men, even if one of them was her brother).  And what can I say about this version's Miss Caroline Bingley except that all she does is scowl, purse her lips and look conceited?  Anna Chancellor of the 1995 version may not be as attractive as Kelly Reilly, but she was definitely better developed.  In fact, the characters and storyline were better developed in the 1995 version.  Then again, the miniseries had eight episodes, plenty of time to be true to the novel.  Also, this version is not as centered on humor as it should have been.  This version is more solemn and everything and everyone centers on Elizabeth.  Then there are the anachronisms.  Mr. Bingley would have never entered the private chambers of a female guest, Elizabeth would have never walked around the village with her hair undone, Mr. Darcy would have never entered Elizabeth's bedroom (without wearing a cravat) to hand her a letter, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh would never pay a visit in the middle of the night.  Perhaps these details are negligible to some, but not for me.  Period accuracy is very important to me.  All in all, despite all the flaws I mentioned regarding the cast and condensed plot due to the limited 129-minute format, this adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is still worth watching and owning, which is why I give it four stars.  The last scenes are wonderful and romantic (if a bit corny), perfect for fans of period pieces with modern-day sensitivities.  The DVD is also wonderful -- great audio and video with wonderful special features.  I highly recommend it.  And, if you haven't watched it, please get the A&E;/BBC production starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle if you long for a truer adaptation of Austen's literary classic.  That goes without saying, but I had to anyway. :-)",4,"Not perfect or quite as good as P&P '95, but still enjoyable and recommendable...",1160870400,"10 15, 2006",2006,6565,"['am', 'avid', 'fan',

But,  I had thought it would have been better--Emma and Sense and Sensibility were much better shortened Hollywood versions of Austen's books than this was.So what did I find wrong with this adaptation?1.  The Bennets looked sloppy and poor.  I immediately thought back to two lines from the book that made me think that this was not how the Bennet's should have appeared:  Jane tells Lizzy ""We're not very poor."" and Lizzy telling Lady Catherine ""He is a gentleman and I am a gentleman's daughter, so far we are equal.""  I felt that the Bennet's looked just a little better than the orphans in Oliver Twist.2.  Mr. Bennett was portrayed as a grumpy old man.  One thing I  loved about Pride and Predjudice was Austen's humor and Mr. Bennett had in my opinion some of her best lines.  These were totally lacking in this movie and didn't need to be--why change his character completely?  True, he did redeem himself a little in the end and I loved the line about sending in any beau's that may call for Kitty and Mary.""3.  At the movie's beginning, Lizzy seemed to have a chip on her shoulder and hated Darcy from the moment he walked in the door.  I couldn't account for that.  She felt at liberty to make biting comments to him before she ever overheard his critical comment of her.  She really irritated me from the beginning and it was hard to get past that to enjoy the rest of the movie.4.  Mr.  Bingley appeared as a bumbling imbesole instead of a humble and likeable gentleman and I agree with one writer that the actress who played Jane would have made a better Elizabeth.  Jane seemed to have more wits about her than Lizzy.  Kitty and Lydia and sometimes Lizzy seemed to giggle for no reason.  I found them irritating as well. Georgiana Darcy's character was also altered.  The book describes her as being very shy as to appear a snob but that is not so.  This Georgiana was not a bit shy.Overall, I felt that the end of the film was better than the beginning, but I still would never buy or recommend this movie.  I wondered if I would have liked it better having known nothing of the book.  I would have preferred much more of the story cut out to develop the overall love story between Elizabeth and Darcy and give certain characters more presence.I know that my reviews will probably be unpopular, since others who have rated this movie poorly have recieved ratings to reflect that, but to be honest, I find it hard to find many things I liked about this version.I'll stick to the A&E; version.",1,Worse than I expected,1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,2636,"['Admittedly', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'moving', 'knowing', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'do', '2', 'hours', 'what', 'A', 'E', 'did', '5+', 'hours', 'had', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Emma', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'shortened', 'Hollywood', 'versions', 'Austen', 'books', 'was.So', 'what', 'did', 'find', 'wrong', 'adaptation', '1', 'Bennets', 'looked', 'sloppy', 'poor', 'immediately', 'thought', 'back', 'two', 'lines', 'book', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'not', 'how', 'Bennet', 'should', 'have', 'appeared', 'Jane', 'Lizzy', ""'re"", 'not', 'very', 'poor', 'Lizzy', 'telling', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'gentleman', 'am', 'gentleman', 'daughter', 'so', 'far', 'are', 'equal', 'felt', 'Bennet', 'looked', 'just', 'little', 'better', 'orphans', 'Oliver', 'Twist.2', 'Mr.', 'Bennett', 'was', 'portrayed', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'One', 'thing', 'loved', 'Pride', 'Predjudice', 'was', 'Austen', 'humor', 'Mr.', 'Bennett', 'had', 'opinion', 'best', 'lines', 'were', 'totally', 'lacking', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'why', 'change', 'character', 'completely', 'True', 'did', 'redeem', 'little', 'end', 'loved', 'line', 'sending', 'beau', 'may', 'call', 'Kitty', 'Mary.', '3', 'movie', 'beginning', 'Lizzy', 'seemed', 'have', 'chip', 'shoulder', 'hated', 'Darcy', 'moment', 'walked', 'door', 'could', ""n't"", 'account', 'felt', 'liberty', 'make', 'biting', 'comments', 'ever', 'overheard', 'critical', 'comment', 'really', 'irritated', 'beginning', 'was', 'hard', 'get', 'past', 'enjoy', 'rest', 'movie.4', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'appeared', 'bumbling', 'imbesole', 'instead', 'humble', 'likeable', 'gentleman', 'agree', 'one', 'writer', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Jane', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'Elizabeth', 'Jane', 'seemed', 'have', 'more', 'wits', 'Lizzy', 'Kitty', 'Lydia', 'sometimes', 'Lizzy', 'seemed', 'giggle', 'reason', 'found', 'irritating', 'as', 'well', 'Georgiana', 'Darcy', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'altered', 'book', 'being', 'very', 'shy', 'appear', 'snob', 'not', 'so', 'Georgiana', 'was', 'not', 'bit', 'shy.Overall', 'felt', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'better', 'beginning', 'still', 'would', 'never', 'buy', 'recommend', 'movie', 'wondered', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'better', 'having', 'known', 'nothing', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'cut', 'out', 'develop', 'overall', 'love', 'story', 'Elizabeth', 'Darcy', 'give', 'certain', 'characters', 'more', 'presence.I', 'know', 'reviews', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'unpopular', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'rated', 'movie', 'poorly', 'have', 'recieved', 'ratings', 'reflect', 'be', 'honest', 'find', 'hard', 'find', 'many', 'things', 'liked', 'version.I', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'A', 'E', 'version']",N/A

The worst feature of the film is the script, with its utterly tin-eared adaptation of Austen's brilliant dialogue. The casting, acting, costumes and attempts to represent daily life in the Regency are also really, really bad. Austen's Eliza Bennett is a rather sharp-tongued young lady, but Keira Knightley plays her as an out and out boor. Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett has to be one of the most inappropriate pieces of casting I've ever seen. The filmmakers seem to think that Regency gentlemen lived like Albanian peasants of the same era -- e.g., see the scene in which Donald Sutherland is seen following a large pig into the pigsty which is actually attached to the Bennetts' house. Elizabeth and Darcy play the climactic love scene outside, in their jammies.

Just like every other movie, this one had strengths and weakness, here is my take on it:Strengths-This movie looked amazing, it was truely beautiful to look at! The cinematography was beautiful and more artistic than a lot of flims that have come out. The colors were very rich, and the lighting was...perfect. Location shots were wide and encompassing; when Elizabeth first saw Mr. Darcy's home, you can ""feel"" and see how large and impressive it is. Another seen that stands out, was when Elizabeth was being shown around Mr. Darcy's home and is shown into a room full of light, and sculptures. The feeling of coolness in the room, being full of diffused light, and pale white marble figures, was lovely!I also enjoyed a more ""down to earth feel"" to the family, and their looks. They may have had a richer station in the book, but the fact that the family was not swimming in silks, furniture and little lap dogs, hardly detracts from the film. Not to mention the sisters acted, well...like girls! We are not all perfectly behaved all the time, nor are we little angels.Also, the ages for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy in the actors, were closer to the book. And I think their youth and inexperience with love/relationships, was a nice refreshing way to act their parts.Finely, I loved the big ballroom, dance! The music, wall to wall people and activity was very realistic. I felt like I was there in the room, listening to the girls talking, dancing and laughing. In our modern age of elictric lights, CD players and deodorant I think we sometimes forget what a candle light party, with a bunch of sweaty people in it would look like.Weaknesses-Yes, the story is kind of choppy. If you haven't either read the book, or seen the four hour A&E; version you might be lost. Although strangely enough, I went to see this with four other women...all fairly ""girly girls"", and they all felt the story went ""too slow"" and was almost ""too long for a movie"".Another thing I have to agree with, is that the different relationships could have been given more time, or better development. But still, at the end of the movie you don't leave wondering what happend to anyone, or wondering why someone was left out. You know what happens!Conclusion-In the end I really liked this movie. The twist's and a different artistic take on a good story, is always a pleasant thing. Maybe it wasn't historiclly perfect, or exact to the book...but if that is what you really want; Stick to the book.",5,Ok...so I liked it!,1146787200,"05 5, 2006",2006,2571,"['reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'movie', 'felt', 'just', 'had', 'be', 'one', 'say', 'something', 'nice', 'Just', 'other', 'movie', 'one', 'had', 'strengths', 'weakness', 'here', 'take', 'Strengths-This', 'movie', 'looked', 'amazing', 'was', 'truely', 'beautiful', 'look', 'cinematography', 'was', 'beautiful', 'more', 'artistic', 'lot', 'flims', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'colors', 'were', 'very', 'rich', 'lighting', 'was', 'perfect', 'Location', 'shots', 'were', 'wide', 'encompassing', 'when', 'Elizabeth', 'first', 'saw', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'home', 'can', 'feel', 'see', 'how', 'large', 'impressive', 'seen', 'out', 'was', 'when', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'being', 'shown', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'home', 'shown', 'room', 'full', 'light', 'sculptures', 'feeling', 'coolness', 'room', 'being', 'full', 'diffused', 'light', 'pale', 'white', 'marble', 'figures', 'was', 'lovely', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'down', 'earth', 'feel', 'family', 'looks', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'richer', 'station', 'book', 'fact', 'family', 'was', 'not', 'swimming', 'silks', 'furniture', 'little', 'lap', 'dogs', 'hardly', 'film', 'Not', 'mention', 'sisters', 'acted', 'well', 'girls', 'are', 'not', 'perfectly', 'behaved', 'time', 'are', 'little', 'angels.Also', 'ages', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'actors', 'were', 'closer', 'book', 'think', 'youth', 'inexperience', 'love/relationships', 'was', 'nice', 'refreshing', 'way', 'act', 'parts.Finely', 'loved', 'big', 'ballroom', 'dance', 'music', 'wall', 'wall', 'people', 'activity', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'felt', 'was', 'there', 'room', 'listening', 'girls', 'talking', 'dancing', 'laughing', 'modern', 'age', 'elictric', 'lights', 'CD', 'players', 'deodorant', 'think', 'sometimes', 'forget', 'what', 'candle', 'light', 'party', 'bunch', 'sweaty', 'people', 'would', 'look', 'like.Weaknesses-Yes', 'story', 'kind', 'choppy', 'have', ""n't"", 'either', 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'four', 'hour', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'might', 'be', 'lost', 'strangely', 'enough', 'went', 'see', 'four', 'other', 'women', 'fairly', 'girly', 'girls', 'felt', 'story', 'went', 'too', 'slow', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'long', 'movie', 'thing', 'have', 'agree', 'different', 'relationships', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'time', 'better', 'development', 'still', 'end', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'wondering', 'what', 'happend', 'anyone', 'wondering', 'why', 'someone', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'know', 'what', 'Conclusion-In', 'end', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'twist', 'different', 'artistic', 'take', 'good', 'story', 'always', 'pleasant', 'thing', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'historiclly', 'perfect', 'exact', 'book', 'what', 'really', 'want', 'Stick', 'book']",N/A

Rothlind,"[7, 15]","I suppose it could be said it was my misfortune to be introduced to Pride and Prejudice by the 1983 BBC adaption by Fay Weldon directed by Cyril Coke and starring Elizabeth Garvey and David Rintoul. Not the 1940 Leonard version with Oliver and Greer Garson, nor the later BBC adaptation with Colin Firth, and not, alas, this 2005 version measure up in tone or historical accuracy. The beauty and faithfulness of Weldon's script, the spot-on casting and attention to historical detail more than make up for the lesser production values.Keira Kneightly fails completely to project the moral character of Jane, conveying little more than a sort of morose petulance with her vacant, glazed-over expressions, colossus of a jaw and toothy mouth. Spoiled and resentful instead of spirited and principled, her emotionally constipated delivery of lines seems forced and pugnacious rather than courageous. Nothing about her invites us in--she is too stiff and self-conscious, too virginal. Sentimental music by the yard and grand landscapes are no substitute for emotional resonance with the protagonist. The thread-bear script is in part to blame for the failure to convincingly embody the moral- and class-conflicts that drive the novel. Jane is never allowed to manifest as the outspoken, head-strong, shrewd yet empathic young woman that she is. Perhaps her character was dumbed-down out of a fear that a modern-day audience, with its egalitarian prejudices (the taboo against distinguishing oneself intellectually) and despite its enlightened feminism, might be put-off by such a characterization. Elizabeth Garvey, on the other hand, managed to be alluringly feminine (warm) and intriguingly articulate--the ideal balance of head and heart.The film fails to convey the mores or the class- and sex distinctions of the period with any conviction. The minds behind this adaptation seem younger (more beholden to youth-culture) and older (wan and worn-out) at once. Judi Dench does raise the octane level with her caricature of Lady Catherine De Bourg's demonic fury. But Brenda Blithyn as Mrs. Bennett is not irritating or shrewish enough by half, and Donald Sutherland, emasculated and mumbling his way through in one continuous aside, is completely wasted. Only in the 1983 BBC adaptation has the character of the father been allowed to assert his patriarchal prerogative and provide an effective check to the over-bearing and histrionic mother, who was meant to be insufferable. Matthew MacFaydean makes a sleepy, crestfallen and disengaged Darcy, where Rintoul is authentically haughty with hidden depths. A lot was sacrificed in the characterizations of both Darcy and Jane to make them `likable' to modern day hipsters. The result is a confection of a film, hollow and without integrity, content to be a historical spectacle.By the time Darcy and Jane come together in Cyril Coke's 1983 adaptation--without as much as a kiss, just a couple strolling through a park--it's quite overwhelming. I'm hard-pressed to think of another reconciliation in all of film that could compete for impact. And it's all done with spoken dialogue--the sublimely beautiful language of Jane Austen faithfully rendered by Fay Weldon--and silence. There is an element of cosmic tragedy as the camera sweeps up over the trees, even as they emerge at long last from all their pretenses and misunderstandings (""pride and prejudice!"") to bear their souls, happily surrendering to one another. It is the archtypal situation of love supervening upon hatred (envy).Kneightly and MacFaydean, by contrast, seem more like teen-agers who suddenly stop playing hard to get and find they have the house to themselves. Had they consummated their passion before our very eyes to sweeping violins we could not have cared any less. So if you want to be transported to another time and mind-set, to a pre-modern world at once more rigid and more genteel, try the Coke adaptation. It is as close as you will get to reading the novel without actually reading it.",2,Not the Spirit or the Letter,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,4018,"['suppose', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'was', 'misfortune', 'be', 'introduced', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', '1983', 'BBC', 'adaption', 'Fay', 'Weldon', 'directed', 'Cyril', 'Coke', 'starring', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvey', 'David', 'Rintoul', 'Not', '1940', 'Leonard', 'version', 'Oliver', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'later', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'not', 'alas', '2005', 'version', 'measure', 'up', 'tone', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'beauty', 'faithfulness', 'Weldon', 'script', 'spot-on', 'casting', 'attention', 'historical', 'detail', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'lesser', 'production', 'values.Keira', 'Kneightly', 'completely', 'project', 'moral', 'character', 'Jane', 'conveying', 'little', 'more', 'sort', 'morose', 'petulance', 'vacant', 'glazed-over', 'expressions', 'colossus', 'jaw', 'toothy', 'mouth', 'Spoiled', 'resentful', 'instead', 'spirited', 'principled', 'emotionally', 'constipated', 'delivery', 'lines', 'forced', 'pugnacious', 'rather', 'courageous', 'Nothing', 'invites', 'too', 'stiff', 'self-conscious', 'too', 'virginal', 'Sentimental', 'music', 'yard', 'grand', 'landscapes', 'are', 'substitute', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'protagonist', 'thread-bear', 'script', 'part', 'blame', 'failure', 'convincingly', 'embody', 'moral-', 'class-conflicts', 'drive', 'novel', 'Jane', 'never', 'allowed', 'manifest', 'outspoken', 'head-strong', 'shrewd', 'yet', 'empathic', 'young', 'woman', 'Perhaps', 'character', 'was', 'dumbed-down', 'fear', 'modern-day', 'audience', 'egalitarian', 'prejudices', 'taboo', 'distinguishing', 'intellectually', 'enlightened', 'feminism', 'might', 'be', 'put-off', 'characterization', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvey', 'other', 'hand', 'managed', 'be', 'alluringly', 'feminine', 'warm', 'intriguingly', 'articulate', 'ideal', 'balance', 'head', 'heart.The', 'film', 'convey', 'mores', 'class-', 'sex', 'distinctions', 'period', 'conviction', 'minds', 'adaptation', 'seem', 'younger', 'more', 'beholden', 'youth-culture', 'older', 'wan', 'worn-out', 'once', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'raise', 'octane', 'level', 'caricature', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'De', 'Bourg', 'demonic', 'fury', 'Brenda', 'Blithyn', 'Mrs.', 'Bennett', 'not', 'irritating', 'shrewish', 'enough', 'half', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'emasculated', 'mumbling', 'way', 'one', 'continuous', 'aside', 'completely', 'wasted', 'Only', '1983', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'character', 'father', 'been', 'allowed', 'assert', 'patriarchal', 'prerogative', 'provide', 'effective', 'check', 'over-bearing', 'histrionic', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'insufferable', 'Matthew', 'MacFaydean', 'sleepy', 'crestfallen', 'disengaged', 'Darcy', 'where', 'Rintoul', 'authentically', 'haughty', 'hidden', 'depths', 'lot', 'was', 'sacrificed', 'characterizations', 'Darcy', 'Jane', 'make', 'likable', 'modern', 'day', 'hipsters', 'result', 'confection', 'film', 'hollow', 'integrity', 'content', 'be', 'historical', 'spectacle.By', 'time', 'Darcy', 'Jane', 'come', 'together', 'Cyril', 'Coke', '1983', 'adaptation', 'as', 'much', 'kiss', 'just', 'couple', 'strolling', 'park', 'quite', 'overwhelming', ""'m"", 'hard-pressed', 'think', 'reconciliation', 'film', 'could', 'compete', 'impact', 'done', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'sublimely', 'beautiful', 'language', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'faithfully', 'rendered', 'Fay', 'Weldon', 'silence', 'element', 'cosmic', 'tragedy', 'camera', 'up', 'trees', 'even', 'emerge', 'long', 'last', 'pretenses', 'misunderstandings', 'pride', 'prejudice', 'bear', 'souls', 'happily', 'surrendering', 'one', 'archtypal', 'situation', 'love', 'supervening', 'hatred', 'envy', '.Kneightly', 'MacFaydean', 'contrast', 'seem', 'more', 'teen-agers', 'who', 'suddenly', 'stop', 'playing', 'hard', 'get', 'find', 'have', 'house', 'Had', 'consummated', 'passion', 'very', 'eyes', 'sweeping', 'violins', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'So', 'want', 'be', 'transported', 'time', 'mind-set', 'pre-modern', 'world', 'once', 'more', 'rigid', 'more', 'genteel', 'try', 'Coke', 'adaptation', 'as', 'close', 'will', 'get', 'reading', 'novel', 'actually', 'reading']",N/A

I was not a fan of Ang Lee's 'Sense and Sensibility' yet after watching this wonderful and delightful film I just might watch the latter again, you know, for a second opinion.  Based off of Jane Austins novel of the same name, Pride & Prejudice revolves around Elizabeth Bennet (Knightley) and her sisters as their mother (Brenda Blethyn) tries to marry them off.  The eldest daughter Jane (Rosamund Pike) is quickly taken fancy by a wealthy young man, yet it's his best friend Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) who catches the eye of young Liz, but not in a good way.  While she can't deny her attraction for him, his arogance blinds her love and drives her away from him, but as events take place that uncover her eyes to the real man he is she puts her pride and pejudice aside to be with the man she loves.  The acting here is top notch, with Keira taking the top position here.  She was brilliant, lovable, likable, adorable and believable.  Donald Sutherland, who play's Liz's father, did amazing with his role and I can see why so many wanted him to recieve an oscar nomination.  I was also very impressed with the amount of power Dame Judi Dench brought to a role that recieved such little screen time.  The scene where she confronts Liz is one of the best in the film.  She truly is a star.  This film, from start to finish, was oscar worthy and theres no doubt in my mind that we'll see Keira at the awards again soon, hopfully this time she will be taking home her own little (yet heavy) man.",5,"""And how are you feeling today, Mrs. Darcy?""",1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,1539,"[""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'movies', 'nature', 'was', 'not', 'fan', 'Ang', 'Lee', ""'Sense"", 'Sensibility', 'yet', 'watching', 'wonderful', 'delightful', 'film', 'just', 'might', 'watch', 'latter', 'again', 'know', 'second', 'opinion', 'Based', 'Jane', 'Austins', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Knightley', 'sisters', 'mother', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'marry', 'off', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'quickly', 'taken', 'fancy', 'wealthy', 'young', 'man', 'best', 'friend', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'who', 'eye', 'young', 'Liz', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'attraction', 'arogance', 'love', 'away', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'eyes', 'real', 'man', 'pride', 'pejudice', 'aside', 'be', 'man', 'acting', 'here', 'top', 'notch', 'Keira', 'taking', 'top', 'position', 'here', 'was', 'brilliant', 'lovable', 'likable', 'adorable', 'believable', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'play', 'Liz', 'father', 'did', 'amazing', 'role', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'wanted', 'recieve', 'oscar', 'nomination', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'impressed', 'amount', 'power', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'brought', 'role', 'recieved', 'such', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'scene', 'where', 'Liz', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'truly', 'star', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'was', 'oscar', 'worthy', 'doubt', 'mind', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Keira', 'awards', 'again', 'soon', 'hopfully', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'taking', 'home', 'own', 'little', 'yet', 'heavy', 'man']",N/A

I didn't like the actor they chose for Mr. Darcy, I didn't like Keira as Elizabeth. There were also some aspects of the play that irked me- technical things; things the character wouldn't do. Of course, I realize that it has been a few years since I thorougly read Pride and Prejudice but as the movie continued on I began to enjoy it.I found the actor who played Mr. Darcy very attractive. I loved the costumes, the music, I thought the acting was good and lo and behold, I loved the movie. I cannot stop watching it. I enjoy trying to catch the little mannerisms of the characters and the looks between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. The more I watch it the more I realized that I was wrong about Keira- she was really good in this.I can understand why many people may not like it. There are some movie adaptations based on some of my favorite books that I hated. Am I a purist? No! but sometimes you just want the movie to catch the magic of the book and I'm starting to realize that it can't happen. That's why you can always go back and read the book. It's more fulfilling when you can envision the characters yourself.This movie is not for everyone, Austen fans or not. I never seen the Colin Firth version but now I want to.

First, Keira Knightley does an amazing job as Elizabeth and she has a face that is so captivating that you cannot keep your eyes off of her.  In every movie she is in, she steals the scene.  Matthew Macfayden does an excellent job as Mr. Darcy as he transforms himself in the movie from one type of character to another.  When you're supposed to dislike him, you do.  When you're supposed to like him, you do.  Simon Woods as Mr. Bingley also does an excellent job and is very likable throughout the movie.

640586,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00005JOHI,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[8, 13]","Before it was released, Joe Wright's adaptation of Jane Austen's novel seemed destined for failure.  After all, a ""definitive"" BBC version starring Colin Firth already existed, with a stellar cast and a faithfulness to Austen that purists adored.  This newest entry, however, is every bit as compelling as its BBC relative.  Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet is brilliant; her Elizabeth is keenly intelligent, witty, spunky, and, above all, utterly charming.  While the BBC version may be known as the ""Colin Firth version"" for that actor's memorable performance as Darcy, this one will be known as the ""Keira Knightley version,"" as the emphasis here is firmly on Elizabeth, exactly what Austen would have intended.  Of course, Knightley is surrounded by excellent actors such as Mathew Macfayden (Darcy), Judi Dench (Lady Catherine), and Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennet), but her outstanding performance is responsible for this film's success.For those unfamiliar with the plot:  the Bennet family lives in a precarious situation.  With no male heirs and a household of five unmarried daughters, their future is uncertain, as the house will be inherited by the family toad, Mr. Collins, upon Mr. Bennet's death.  As in most Austen novels, the mother sets about frantically trying to match up her girls with men of social standing and wealth to ensure that they will all be cared for.  When repressed aristocrat Darcy and his foppish but eligible friend Bingley arrive in the country, Mrs. Bennet starts scheming.  In keeping with the theme, the truth of matters are often obscured by the ""pride and prejudice"" of the characters, lending complexity to the plot.Probably the most amazing accomplishment in this film is the transformation of Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship.  Macfayden is cold, judgmental, repressed, and glowering--and yet by the end of the film, without significant change in his countenance, his Darcy seems perfect for Knightley's radiant Elizabeth.  Likewise, Elizabeth's gradual appreciation of Darcy is completely believable, although unfortunately the film suggests that his wealth first turns her head.  Much of what transpires between these characters is expertly shown through the actors' eyes and small gestures, which then makes it equally believable that no one else suspects their growing affection for each other.This adaptation, while not entirely faithful to the novel, captures the spirit of Austen's masterpiece.  The cinematography is as accomplished as the performances, giving the film a vibrancy that puts aside any question of pretension.  The only sour note comes in the last moments of the film when Wright and screenwriter Moggach opt for sappiness over the unsentimental beauty of the rest.  This misstep can be forgiven, given the utter brilliance of everything that comes before it.

640588,A2G1GCHGVUG98K,B00005JOHI,dee,"[9, 12]","This version has its merits.  The scenery is terrific, and the one scene in the morning mist with the sun rising is incomparably beautiful.  Mary and Anne de Bourgh are treated more sympathetically than in the BBC miniseries' version, and Jane and Wickham are very good-looking (as they're written in the novel).  Judi Dench as Lady Catherine is good.The two-hour time frame makes it difficult to develop the story very much, so basically everything that isn't Lizzy-Darcy is truncated (Lizzy-Jane, Lizzy-Mr. Bennet relationship, even Lydia and Wickham is shortened).  Some of the period stuff (another reviewer mentioned the bedroom visits, and the costuming) is a little off.  But these aren't major problems, at least for me.My main issue with it is that it feels like a twenty-first century version of the story.  It is more angsty, and it takes a very modern young person view of Lizzy and Darcy--that is, it has them behave emotionally more like us moderns would at their ages rather than the Lizzy and Darcy of the novel and of two centuries ago.  It's got a twinge of the WB teenage drama in it.The cleverness and the wit of Austen's work are minimal here, and it feels more somber.  Mr. Bennet's ""sarcastic humor"" is gone; his lines are delivered seriously.  Mr. Collins' servility and Mrs. Bennet's nerves and silliness are much toned down from their BBC versions, making the characters more personable, but it feels just a little less.  (Less amusing, for sure.)I had trouble caring for this movie's Lizzy and Darcy.  Austen's Elizabeth had an easy playfulness and a quickness about her.  This Elizabeth has lost most of her witty humor (albeit fitting of the more serious tone of the movie) and thus comes across a little shrill, without the lively charm to cover for her more ""insolent"" moments.She is emotional and flighty, swinging from smiling and giggly to crying hard, to yelling (raising her voice) at Darcy during the first proposal--which seems a little weird for the restrained manners of that time period.  This Elizabeth feels more like a modern, fiery teenager than the proper, confident but lively novel heroine.Darcy, here, instead of being proud, just comes across as sad.  He has sad puppy dog eyes the entire movie.  To me, it makes Lizzy's rejection seem a lot harsher.  Even the end scene (for American audiences?) didn't make me like them any more--it just felt hokey instead.The novel has Lizzy and Darcy as equals in intellect and in faults--Lizzy to drop her prejudice and Darcy to learn to change his pride.  In this movie version, Lizzy just comes around to where Darcy is; he doesn't change.As a movie taken by itself, not bad, and a fast way to acquaint onself with the basic storyline.

Sorry...kill me!!I enjoy movies and don't feel the need all the time to read the novel beforehand.I did read ""No country for Old men"" before seen the movie. Definitely there's a big gap between some movies and their book.I also understand that movies have only 2 hours to comprise a book.  Many fans of the book may not share the inevitable editing choices, due to time and business constraints.  That is another constant inevitable.  But also, those editing choices made it possible for an excellent book to reach a mainstream audience, that otherwise may never have had the possibility to be exposed to some part of it and/or relate to it so closely.Since this a forum to review THE MOVIE, I'll do that.  I hope some readersappreciate my review it's not biased by the novel, which I don't doubt is great.First the cinematography and photography are outstanding.  The music is beautiful, it enhances greatly every piece.  The costumes are gorgeous, may or may not be appropriate for the period on some regard.The language is striking, rolls over the tongues of the characters easily and pleasantly.Sophisticated language used to provide a richer communication than we have with our contemporary butchery of it.Reminder of a time where people read and language was enjoyed and honed to increase it's effectiveness, on societies where statements were carefully worded, because what said meant what it meant, and people were not able to hide behind sarcasm and ignorance, when honor was beheld high.  And the consequences of disrespect and/or misunderstandings were significant.A time without TV:) -if you want to save your soul smash yours with a bat-Mr. Darcy is a proud, perfectionist man.  A pose he adopts to protect himself from his insecurities.  By this device, avoiding the risk of trying to attract and be rejected.  He places unrealistic qualities on his ideal woman to avoid having again to be attracted to the real one and be rejected.The essence of shyness, which everyone can relate to.  The flawed leading man, cornerstone of every good script.""I don't have the talent of conversing easily with people I have not met before"", Darcy confesses to Elizabeth, revealing his flaw, disarming himself and standing naked shy before the woman he loves, as his greatest gift.  Teased by Elizabeth, he finds himself as rules of seduction will point,even more captivated by her.And rising love as a catalyst of virtuosity in men, the only force so powerful as to bring a man out of this shell of pride, and risk utter embarrassment: his deepest fear.The fear of, as The great Lebanese poet/philosopher Kahlil Gibram says on  ""The Prophet"" in his essay about Love:""...To know the pain of too much tenderness.To be wounded by your own understanding of love;And to bleed willingly and joyfully...""Darcy Places too much importance and pride on his intellect.  Hence, protecting himself of the ""foolishness"" of emotions, and all spontaneous crazyness that comes with strong states of emotion as love, with all the revelations of your true self it entails.  All that could lead to unexpected acts,  and to uncharted territory.  That is dreaded, thus avoided by the one inclined to control out of fear of failure or rejection.The first time he touches Elizabeth's hand to help her into the carriage and feels that unequivocal heat of great chemistry, punishes himself for his warmth and the possibility of having disclosed his emotions.  You can witness that on the shot of the tensing of his hand afterward.  Those subtleties punctuate the movie, and the detail makes the story more intriguing.Elizabeth is as many other heroines, is ahead of her time.  With a strong character and habits considered exclusively masculine is more of a modern woman.  Witty and with an acid sardonic sense of humor punishes all that she spots easily as phony.Her wit and sarcasm her are her own shell, though, as hard as Darcy's.  And also the flaw that bonds them and along with their skill with words.  Language as a an armor becomes also a game for the two, to prove who's able to penetrate the other defenses, mascaraded attraction, finallyWounding them both, with the delicious bittersweet tenderness of sexual repression liberated.And yes, ever so trite: love.She's more open to love, and so able to taunt Darcy into following her into their final ""jump"" into the unknown depths and heights of love and their ultimate purification.  Below the pouring rain, yes, a trite a cliche as it can be cliche, but still powerful as powerful poetry can be.""A woman difficult to alarm"" as Mr Darcy qualifies her, Elizabeth is, as all heroines, a malcontent, a free soul not bounded by social conventions.  Moreover, a rebel and a outspoken critic of conventions.Again, traits contemporarily all can relate strongly, and make her so attractive as a modern character.It was a time and place where women are limited by social structuring to depend in a great deal on men's favors of their beauty primarily.  Relegating education to a lesser state,On the scale of traits needed for survival and social acceptance.For men also emblematic of power, pride, honor, masculinity, etc.Marriage then was a huge deal in  their lives.  These period conditions conjure more intense romantic games.  With more at stake, with more tension, pride and prejudice keep lovers apart, through the heart wrenching twists and turns, ebbs and flows that we love to watch until the expected happens.Demoting the less physically endowed to settle to a very restricted lifestyle.The men pursuing the attractive females and the woman the powerful men is another trait  that remains until our days.  Modified  in form but not essence.  A condition we can also relate and understand it's inception better, watching this period.Donald Sutherland's character is the icing on the cake.  He's just marvelous. As a father whose daughter's can confide for support, without the fear of a backlash of chauvinism.Smart enough to grasp the female soul is refreshing, specially on this context.I suggest this movie to all romantics at heart, who dare to be mocked and fooled.For the bravest of men, who dare or even indulge and see ""chick flicks"" proudly, beyond the purpose of scoring some points.And for anybody who likes beautiful photography, scenery and a well written piece.",4,A blueprint for all romance movies,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",2008,6368,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'book', 'seen',

The Colin Firth version truly does justice to the story, which I now realize this version did not.Additionally in this version they have really taken some liberties in modernizing both the interactions (e.g. Elizabeth's wit takes on such a sarcastic, biting tone that it REALLY stretches my suspension of disbelief that a lady could have behaved in such a manner) as well as in the actions (e.g. Darcy walking into Elizabeth's private quarters at night, unannounced and with Elizabeth unattended).All that said, I've left it at 5 stars simply because as a standalone film, it's a wonderful story and a visual feast.

Of all the films I saw last year, this is one of the few I felt I would want to see again and so I purchased it on DVD and have watched it a few times since my purchase.  In fact, now that it is being shown on HBO during the holiday season when I have more free time than usual, I have watched it several MORE times--which is very unusual for me.  But this has very quickly become one of my FAVORITE movies.I am a big Jane Austen fan and loved the Firth/Ehle 1995 production and also the earlier 1980 BBC production with David Rintoul which I used to introduce my daughter to Jane Austen several years ago.  I don't think it's all that relevant to this film to compare it to the TV productions since a TV miniseries can be so much more faithful to the novel itself given much longer playing time and less need for distinctive scenery and sets.In order to translate such a social novel successfully to the film screen, and in order to attract a more varied audience than those who faithfully appreciate Masterpiece Theater, dramatic visuals were needed and the sets and scenery took on much greater importance.  Also a much simpler story was imperative to fit in a two hour framework.  The choices made were admirable.  The scenery is so beautiful and so evocative of rural England, the acting is inspired, the dialogue is perfect and the drama moves quickly and holds the interest even of those highly unlikely to pick up and read a Jane Austen novel--even my husband, a comedy and adventure film fan, loves this movie.I think the relevant group to which this film should be compared are the other big award winners of 2006, and this is a FAR SUPERIOR film to many of the films which won big awards.  I was able to watch 'Walk the Line' a second time, and I HAD to watch 'Syriana' a second time to understand it all--they were both good films and I have to admit I even enjoyed Crash when I first saw it--but I would never bother to watch 'Crash' again, and I think this film gets better each time I see it.  Each time I watch it I see something new in the sets, in the performances, in the story, and in the direction.

Consequently, I went to the theatre expecting to be disappointed. I stand (sit, actually) corrected in the most vehement manner. I never would have believed it possible, but this is better than the BBC version. Matthew Macfadyen is better (!!!) than Mr. Firth was, and I will be very disappointed if Ms. Knightly does not win the Best Actress Oscar. To think I would ever say that, especially after her insipid performance in ""Pirates of the Caribbean!"" But, quite frankly, she deserves all the praise she has garnered for her performance as Elizabeth.Donald Sutherland plays Mr. Bennet with a sympathy that was completely lacking in the BBC version, and he quickly became my favorite character. (I must stop comparing the two films. They really are apples and oranges, so to speak.) Rosamund Pike. Wow. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Jane. She will forever embody the roll for me. I know that every time I read the book from now on, I will see her in my mind's eye every time Jane speaks. But quite honestly, the real standout, the actor who completely made the film (for me, at least) was Mr. Macfadyen. I was disappointed the first time I saw him. The second time, I decided he was ""not that bad."" By the end of the film (actually, by the time he proposes so horribly), I was completely in love with him (as Darcy, not as an actor), and wondered why on earth Lizzie would have refused his first proposal. Seriously.The cinematography is also breathtaking, and the soundtrack is next on my CD purchasing list. After that, of course, I will be buying the DVD on February 28.

Elizabeth Bennett (Keira Knightley) is one of five daughters of the ""have not"" Bennett family, and her mother (Brenda Blethyn) is anxious to marry them off.  Once Elizabeth encounters Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden), a man who comes from great material wealth, but who lacks a lust for life, it is clear that the unlikely pair has been brought together for a reason, bigger than the both of them.This is an excellent character study and social commentary, on the state of the British class system and the pursuit of true love.  What's more, the actors in this film shine brightly and have great onscreen chemistry.  The photography is luscious, the story is engaging, and this is definitely NOT a chick flick.

Only a bold production team would have taken on the task, given the continuing and justified popularity of the 1996 BBC television version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  Taken on its own merits as a theatrical release, the 2005 version is visually stunning, includes wonderful location shooting and period detail, and offers two attractive leading actors with genuine on-screen chemistry.The storyline is familiar to Jane Austen fans.  The middle-class Bennet family, including its five eligible daughters and a scheming mother anxious to marry them off, learns that the wealthy Mr. Bingley will visit their small English village.  They meet Mr. Bingley at a village dance, where he is attracted to the beautiful and kind but reserved Jane Bennet.  Jane's spirited and headstrong sister Elizabeth is less impressed with Mr. Bingley's seemingly haughty friend Mr. Darcy.  Her disdain for his manners and his prejudice against Jane and against a militia officer whom she favors, will cause Elizabeth to angrily reject his surprise offer of marriage.  However, Elizabeth learns she may have been wrong about Mr. Darcy.  His generous efforts on behalf of Jane and of Elizabeth's eloped youngest sister will earn him a second chance.Keira Knightley is perfectly cast as the young and impertinent Elizabeth.  Matthew MacFadyen is very effective as the painfully shy and reserved Mr. Darcy.  Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn are a sympathetic Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.  The interaction of the Bennet sisters, including Rosamund Pike as Jane and Jena Malone as youngest sister Lydia, is authentic and by turns touching and hilarious.  Judi Dench personifies the ""dragon"" Lady Catherine DeBurgh.Adapting Pride and Prejudice to a two hour movie format means seriously compressing a treasured storyline. Under Director Joe Wright's sure hand, the movie steps briskly through the plot, keeping a tight focus on Elizabeth Bennet and her developing relationship with Mr. Darcy.  Among the key scenes: Elizabeth's chance encounter with Mr. Darcy at Pemberly; Mr. Bingley's proposal to Jane, reworked to bring out the humor and to make explicit Mr. Darcy's role; and Mr. Darcy's second proposal to Elizabeth.  The latter features a long atmospheric tracking shot as Mr. Darcy crosses a field at dawn to meet a surprised Elizabeth.  The next-to-last scene, in which Elizabeth requests permission to marry from her father, brings out the best in two very good actors.""Pride and Prejudice"" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen.

Does one not constantly use comparison as a basis for all judgements in life?  If you deny it, you are deceiving yourself.That said, the music and lighting and colors (cinematography shall we say, minus some instances of jiggly camera movement and disturbing slight zooms in and out) are almost always wonderful throughout this film.  Music + Cinematography = 4.8 Stars.  Beyond that, I was alternately cringing and smiling and the sum which was null.  The Rest = -0.8 Stars.  Thus Average = 2 Stars.It is not necessary to make a movie of a book just because you can.  There are many books, and this is one of them, that require more time to have justice done to their tales.  It's impossible (at least for me) to watch this movie without becoming frustrated, and that's not entertainment.  The dialog is mostly useless, in some parts you may find yourself wondering if the actors are actually being paid for their performances (it can't all be the fault of the screenplay can it?).  I found almost nothing enlightening in this version except for the aforementioned music and cinematography.  I agree with the negative criticism in other reviews of this version of P&P; but will not take the space to repeat it here.I hardly ever write reviews, but I felt irrepressably compelled speak out and warn would-be buyers of this film (probably because I bought it because of the high average rating) - rent it first!!If you've never read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice or seen any other film versions, I encourage you to at least read the book first, and if you must watch this film version first, then afterwards see the 1995 version.  If you're also a Jane Austen-phile and sort of liked this movie, listen to the commentary - some comments will really drive you up the wall, and perhaps cool your opinion of this rendition!

I loved the scene under the rain, it looked like Darcy could barely contain himself from grabbing Elizabeth, and she looked like she wouldnt mind that at all  LOL.  I know, this is not a very intelligent or insightful review, but I'm so delighted with the movie...

640616,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B00005JOHI,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[9, 12]","""Pride and Prejudice,"" directed by Joe Wright, is a beautifully mounted version of the beloved Jane Austen classic.  Gorgeously filmed on location in England, the movie stars Keira Knightley as the spirited Elizabeth Bennet.  Knightley has luminous eyes, a wickedly mischievous smile, and a saucy manner.  The director wisely zooms in on her captivating face in a number of tight close-ups.  Matthew MacFadyen plays Mr. Darcy as an aloof and sullen gentleman, who hides his smoldering sexuality beneath a stolid facade.  Brenda Blethyn is appropriately dithery as the nervous and silly Mrs. Bennet, a mother of five daughters who is desperate to marry her children off to men of means.  Mr. Bennet, played solidly by Donald Sutherland, frequently hides in his study in order to get a respite from his noisy and high-spirited brood.  Also noteworthy are Tom Hollander as the stuffy and pompous Mr. Collins; his pursuit of Elizabeth is met with undisguised disdain.  Dame Judi Dench is formidable in her cameo as the imperious and overbearing Lady Catherine de Bourg. Less successful are the miscast Simon Woods, who turns in a nerdy performance as the carrot-topped Mr. Bingley, and Rosamund Pike, as Jane Bennet, is lovely to look at but a bit too vapid.Roman Osin, the cinematographer, captures the lush beauty of the English countryside and the glamor of Darcy's and Bingley's estates.  The camera is always in motion, panning over the dancers in a ballroom, a breathtaking sunset, a rainy field, and the expressions on the characters' faces.  There is rarely a dull moment in this film. Unfortunately, the dialogue is sometimes difficult to follow because the Wright frequently directs his actors to speak over one another.  In addition, unlike Dench, whose diction is impeccable, some of the performers speak too quickly and fail to enunciate.Another quibble is that the screenwriter, Deborah Moggach, gives short shrift to  Austen's underlying themes of snobbery, social stratification, and the constraints of women in eighteenth century England.  These issues are certainly implied, but they are peripheral to Elizabeth and Darcy's romance, which takes center stage. Still, this movie is a treat for the mind and heart. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is an enchanting, wildly romantic, and entertaining love story that will please all but the most finicky Austen purists.",4,Lush and lovely adaptation.,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,2368,"['Pride', 'Prejudice', 'directed', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'beautifully', 'mounted', 'version', 'beloved', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'classic', 'Gorgeously', 'filmed', 'location', 'England', 'movie', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'spirited', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Knightley', 'luminous', 'eyes', 'wickedly', 'mischievous', 'smile', 'saucy', 'manner', 'director', 'wisely', 'captivating', 'face', 'number', 'tight', 'close-ups', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'aloof', 'sullen', 'gentleman', 'who', 'smoldering', 'sexuality', 'stolid', 'facade', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'appropriately', 'dithery', 'nervous', 'silly', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'mother', 'five', 'daughters', 'who', 'desperate', 'marry', 'children', 'men', 'means', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'played', 'solidly', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'frequently', 'study', 'order', 'get', 'respite', 'noisy', 'high-spirited', 'brood', 'Also', 'noteworthy', 'are', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'stuffy', 'pompous', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'pursuit', 'Elizabeth', 'met', 'undisguised', 'disdain', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'formidable', 'cameo', 'imperious', 'overbearing', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourg', 'Less', 'successful', 'are', 'miscast', 'Simon', 'Woods', 'who', 'nerdy', 'performance', 'carrot-topped', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Jane', 'Bennet', 'lovely', 'look', 'bit', 'too', 'vapid.Roman', 'Osin', 'cinematographer', 'lush', 'beauty', 'English', 'countryside', 'glamor', 'Darcy', 'Bingley', 'estates', 'camera', 'always', 'motion', 'panning', 'dancers', 'ballroom', 'breathtaking', 'sunset', 'rainy', 'field', 'expressions', 'characters', 'rarely', 'dull', 'moment', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'dialogue', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'follow', 'Wright', 'frequently', 'actors', 'speak', 'one', 'addition', 'Dench', 'diction', 'impeccable', 'performers', 'speak', 'too', 'quickly', 'fail', 'quibble', 'screenwriter', 'Deborah', 'Moggach', 'short', 'shrift', 'Austen', 'underlying', 'themes', 'snobbery', 'social', 'stratification', 'constraints', 'women', 'eighteenth', 'century', 'England', 'issues', 'are', 'certainly', 'implied', 'are', 'peripheral', 'Elizabeth', 'Darcy', 'romance', 'center', 'stage', 'Still', 'movie', 'treat', 'mind', 'heart', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'enchanting', 'wildly', 'romantic', 'entertaining', 'love', 'story', 'will', 'please', 'most', 'finicky', 'Austen', 'purists']",N/A
640617,A2R7RMWUXDJISH,B00005JOHI,ED Denson,"[2, 3]","I never thought I would understand Pride & Prejudice enough to critique the film adaptations but some unexpected leisure in the past couple of months has allowed me to see them all. The 1940 Greer Garson is good - indeed all 4 are good although widely different. The Keira Knightly is the best, however, both because of her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet, and because of the warmth of the film maker's conception of the Bennet family.  Of course it is the portrayal of Lizzy that makes or breaks the film, and this is my favorite portrayal, and my pick of the best of the 4.  Keira Knightly is my favorite Elizabeth. She is younger than the other actresses who have played Elizabeth,  and plays a Elizabeth Bennet closer to the 20 year old we read about in the novel. I would not call her beautiful - indeed in this film Jane is the most beautiful of the 5 Bennet sisters, just as she is supposed to be. But Keira is unbelievably attractive because of her facial expressions. She has a marvelous smile and we see a lot of it, and, like Garson, her face can show her emotions and their changes so well that soon you are completely engrossed in her character and her story. As they used to say, ""You'll laugh, you'll cry, but you'll never forget Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennet.""This version also manages to allow Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) to be his sarcastic and witty self without being unpleasant. He is played too harshly in some other versions, especially the 1979 BBC adaptation.  The Bennet family holds together quite well, even Mrs. Bennet is redeemed, although with some dialog that is definitely not in the novel.  Darcy is almost impossible to cast, I suspect. Certainly in this film he is no better than acceptable. Mr. Collins, on the other hand, is very good, although his part is much cut down in the interest of getting a 2 hour film. (We do get to hear a short sample of his preaching). The only unhappy casting is that of Wickham. Wickham is a sociopath, and should have a great deal of charm when he meets Lizzy. Here he is more whiner than charmer. All 3 of the other film makers were able to find someone to fit the bill, but here Keira's boyfriend, I believe, got the part, and he is simply wrong for it. Luckily his role is also quite reduced from that in the novel so we don't see him often enough to be disturbed greatly.So, for those characters that survived the scriptwriter, this is the best cast of the 4 adaptations, and the most sympathetic to the Bennet family. Who is missing? Aunt Phillips and ""broad faced stuffy Uncle Phillips, breathing port wine."" Mr. and Mrs. Hurst, Maria Lucas (well really, excepting Charlotte, Sir William and all the Lucases are missing), Mr. & Mrs. Gardiner's children are gone, although the Gardiners do get to take Lizzy to Pemberly, Mrs. Hill is gone, Mrs. Young is gone, and Mrs. Ainisley is gone,  as are all of the Officers from the ____Shire militia (we see anonymous officers dancing, but no Denny,  and no Col. Forster except by mention. We do not go to London with Jane, or Ramsgate with Georgiana, and never were going to the Lakes. We do get a milita parade, quite a bit of poultry, one Wuthering Heights like view of Lizzy standing in the wind atop a cliff which they would do well to edit out of the film, Darcy's proposal in a faux-temple during a rainstorm, and absolutely the best Assembly Ball ever filmed.  The director's commentary is quite interesting, too.Do you remember the Polanski film where our heroes are pretending to be the living dead, and at a zombie ball they dance down the room until suddenly they come upon a mirror and, being alive, they are reflected in it but none of the other dancers are?  Here when Mr. Darcy dances with Lizzy their conversation becomes so intense that the other dancers vanish for a couple of minutes and we just have our couple dancing alone in the ballroom. I don't know that the scenes connect in any other way but one scene calls forth the other to me.So aside from Wickham, what problems? Everyone compresses the sequence of events at the end, but here someone piled them up and stomped on them. Bingley returns to Netherfield, proposes in the afternoon, Lady Catherine arrives around midnight, and at the next dawn Lizzy and Darcy meet in a foggy field and become engaged. Poor Mr. Collins' letter never arrives, as you can imagine. Where could it have fit in? In about 16 hours of one day, we see what took weeks in the novel. Most bothersome is the visit to Pemberly. Lizzy becomes detached from the Gardiners, wanders off alone in the house, and hearing piano playing,  peeks through a door and sees Georgiana playing, then she sees Darcy enter and his sister and he embrace, till he looks up and sees Elizabeth peeping in at them. That's bad enough, (and quite out of character)  but then she walks back to Lambton without the Gardiners and without looking for them. Is it possible that they did not realize that she was no longer with them as they went through the house?  Still, one can excuse these little things. If we put up with Caroline Bingley's ""fat suit"" costume in the Garson version, we can put up with almost anything.My advice? Buy all 4 versions, book a transatlantic cruise, and give each version one full sea-day to watch and consider. I think you'll find yourself agreeing with me that the Keira Knightly film is the best, and you'll be happy you watched the others.",4,Probably the Best Film Adaptation of the 4,1308096000,"06 15,

640619,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JOHI,Ed Uyeshima,"[14, 19]","You would think that Jane Austen's most famous novel is not in need of another cinematic treatment given the definitive BBC version of a decade ago and the classic 1940 MGM version starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier, not to mention a contemporary 2004 Bollywood-style musical and according to IMDB, at least six other versions. However, first-time feature director Joe Wright and first-time screenwriter Deborah Moggach (with uncredited assistance from Austen adaptation veteran Emma Thompson) have brought youthful vigor and a wild, Thomas Hardy-like element to the movie, and as a whole, it works very well. It almost makes the overly familiar novel feel revitalized.For those who have forgotten their required high school reading, the story focuses on the downscale Bennet family - a passive father and a domineering mother, the latter intent on marrying off their five daughters to wealthy families. Eldest daughter Jane becomes smitten with rich but somewhat weak-willed Mr. Bingley and the bookish Mary keeps to her piano, while the two youngest daughters, Kitty and Lydia, are giggly and boy-crazy. On the other hand, the headstrong Elizabeth wants marriage on her terms with an intellectual equal, and she becomes alternately repelled and drawn to the brooding Mr. Darcy. There are several plotlines that interweave precariously toward the inevitable conclusion, but Austen's witty, often insightful dialogue holds the story together organically with grace and humor.Twenty-year old Keira Knightley is the youthful embodiment of Elizabeth, as her predecessors, Garson in particular, always strike me as too mature for the role. With her beauty subdued in casual period fashion, she manages to convey all the necessary facets of her personality with a natural &eacute;lan. As Darcy, Matthew Macfayden captures the moody character's insolence and growing romanticism with little affectation. Most all of the supporting players shine with Brenda Blethyn as the exasperating Mrs. Bennet, Donald Sutherland as her introspective husband, Tom Hollander as the priggish Mr. Collins, Rosamund Pike as beautiful and likable Jane, Jena Malone convincingly British as the impulsive Lydia, and of course, in all her scene stealing glory, Judi Dench lends acidic vinegar as Lady Catherine, Darcy's disapproving aunt.Parts of the film have a subtly stylized quality, such as the way the camera seems to track uninterrupted during the Assembly Hall ball sequence or when Elizabeth's head spins symbolically as she sits on a swing. There are also many well-turned tableaux-style shots that imbue the spirit of the period with vivid but unobtrusive detail. Credit should go to Roman Osin's textured and sumptuous cinematography, Jacqueline Durran's authentic-feeling costumes and Dario Marianelli's flavorful music, all of which capture a decidedly realistic though ultimately romanticized 16th-century England.The DVD package has several too-short features that provide some background into the production and Austen's characters but hardly enough to provide meaningful insight. Wright provides sometimes interesting commentary on an alternate track that borders a bit on the effusive, and there is an alternative and thankfully excised ending which spells out the plot resolutions unnecessarily. This movie is a joyous celebration of Austen's artistry as a writer whose story themes resonate today.",5,Robust Adaptation of Familiar Austen Novel Is One First-Class Production,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,3398,"['would', 'think', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'most', 'famous', 'novel', 'not', 'need', 'cinematic', 'treatment', 'given', 'definitive', 'BBC', 'version', 'decade', 'ago', 'classic', '1940', 'MGM', 'version', 'starring', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'not', 'mention', 'contemporary', '2004', 'Bollywood-style', 'musical', 'according', 'IMDB', 'least', 'six', 'other', 'versions', 'However', 'first-time', 'feature', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'first-time', 'screenwriter', 'Deborah', 'Moggach', 'uncredited', 'assistance', 'Austen', 'adaptation', 'veteran', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'have', 'brought', 'youthful', 'vigor', 'wild', 'Thomas', 'Hardy-like', 'element', 'movie', 'whole', 'very', 'well', 'almost', 'overly', 'familiar', 'novel', 'feel', 'revitalized.For', 'who', 'have', 'forgotten', 'required', 'high', 'school', 'reading', 'story', 'downscale', 'Bennet', 'family', 'passive', 'father', 'domineering', 'mother', 'latter', 'intent', 'marrying', 'off', 'five', 'daughters', 'wealthy', 'families', 'Eldest', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'smitten', 'rich', 'somewhat', 'weak-willed', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'bookish', 'Mary', 'keeps', 'piano', 'two', 'youngest', 'daughters', 'Kitty', 'Lydia', 'are', 'giggly', 'boy-crazy', 'other', 'hand', 'headstrong', 'Elizabeth', 'marriage', 'terms', 'intellectual', 'equal', 'alternately', 'repelled', 'drawn', 'brooding', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'are', 'several', 'plotlines', 'interweave', 'precariously', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'Austen', 'witty', 'often', 'insightful', 'dialogue', 'story', 'together', 'organically', 'grace', 'humor.Twenty-year', 'old', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'youthful', 'embodiment', 'Elizabeth', 'predecessors', 'Garson', 'particular', 'always', 'strike', 'too', 'mature', 'role', 'beauty', 'subdued', 'casual', 'period', 'fashion', 'convey', 'necessary', 'facets', 'personality', 'natural', 'eacute', 'lan', 'Darcy', 'Matthew', 'Macfayden', 'moody', 'character', 'insolence', 'growing', 'romanticism', 'little', 'affectation', 'Most', 'supporting', 'players', 'shine', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'exasperating', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'introspective', 'husband', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'priggish', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'beautiful', 'likable', 'Jane', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'convincingly', 'British', 'impulsive', 'Lydia', 'course', 'scene', 'stealing', 'glory', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'acidic', 'vinegar', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Darcy', 'disapproving', 'aunt.Parts', 'film', 'have', 'subtly', 'stylized', 'quality', 'such', 'way', 'camera', 'track', 'uninterrupted', 'Assembly', 'Hall', 'ball', 'sequence', 'when', 'Elizabeth', 'head', 'symbolically', 'swing', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'well-turned', 'tableaux-style', 'shots', 'imbue', 'spirit', 'period', 'vivid', 'unobtrusive', 'detail', 'Credit', 'should', 'go', 'Roman', 'Osin', 'textured', 'sumptuous', 'cinematography', 'Jacqueline', 'Durran', 'authentic-feeling', 'costumes', 'Dario', 'Marianelli', 'flavorful', 'music', 'capture', 'decidedly', 'realistic', 'ultimately', 'romanticized', '16th-century', 'England.The', 'DVD', 'package', 'several', 'too-short', 'features', 'provide', 'background', 'production', 'Austen', 'characters', 'hardly', 'enough', 'provide', 'meaningful', 'insight', 'Wright', 'sometimes', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'alternate', 'track', 'bit', 'effusive', 'alternative', 'thankfully', 'excised', 'ending', 'out', 'plot', 'resolutions', 'unnecessarily', 'movie', 'joyous', 'celebration', 'Austen', 'artistry', 'writer', 'story', 'themes', 'resonate', 'today']",N/A

Each shot looks like it has been taken from a painting of a period. Congratulations to the director and cameraman. The acting was good, the casting was good too, with some minor exceptions.It was the interpretation of the story which made me cringe from time to time. Was it really necessary to insert quite a lot of the awkward modern dialogue and the ways of expression into the story to show that it's topical? The director could express himself and convey the social message of the story without distorting the ways and customs of the past and adapting the story to modern ways.For one, could you ever imagine a grand lady of the society bursting into somebody's house in the middle of the night even if the matter was urgent?? Is it really necessary to take such radical measures to emphasize the character's personality? Sometimes I thought there was too much explained and too vividly expressed what could have been left to understand.On the other hand, the story was not very well developed, concentrating on Lizzy alone and leaving behind some important characters. We do not fully comprehend the drama of Lydia's escape with a man as we do not see in the full the wickedness of Mr. Whickam. Concequently, untouched is the theme of the goodness and just appearance of it as well as some other important messages. The story was quckly flowing from scene to scene without allowing the spectator to be involved.Moreover, almost all of the book characters appeared in the film; some, for a second only, after disappearing forever. This only crowded the film and left the residue of unsatisfaction, for you expect the story line to develop somehow in connection with the newly introduced character. True, the director didn't have much time at his disposal, well then... I know some big volumes transferred into the film media without losing their impact. If the director wanted to introduce a new, different interpretation of the story, he succeded only in modernizing dialogue and changing visual style, but his message is quite weaker than the original.On the whole, it is a pleasant production and does deserve an apprisal (for its picture mostly). However, the impeccable version of the book has been already made - 1995 BBC miniseries, and... what's the point in remaking the perfect?!",4,Beautiful picture though,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,2377,"['film', 'worth', 'watching', 'beautiful', 'picture', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'shot', 'been', 'taken', 'painting', 'period', 'Congratulations', 'director', 'cameraman', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'casting', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'minor', 'exceptions.It', 'was', 'interpretation', 'story', 'made', 'cringe', 'time', 'time', 'Was', 'really', 'necessary', 'insert', 'quite', 'lot', 'awkward', 'modern', 'dialogue', 'ways', 'expression', 'story', 'show', 'topical', 'director', 'could', 'express', 'convey', 'social', 'message', 'story', 'distorting', 'ways', 'customs', 'past', 'adapting', 'story', 'modern', 'ways.For', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'imagine', 'grand', 'lady', 'society', 'bursting', 'somebody', 'house', 'middle', 'night', 'even', 'matter', 'was', 'urgent', 'really', 'necessary', 'take', 'such', 'radical', 'measures', 'emphasize', 'character', 'personality', 'Sometimes', 'thought', 'there', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'explained', 'too', 'vividly', 'expressed', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'understand.On', 'other', 'hand', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'developed', 'concentrating', 'Lizzy', 'alone', 'leaving', 'important', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'drama', 'Lydia', 'escape', 'man', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'full', 'wickedness', 'Mr.', 'Whickam', 'Concequently', 'untouched', 'theme', 'goodness', 'just', 'appearance', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'important', 'messages', 'story', 'was', 'quckly', 'flowing', 'scene', 'scene', 'allowing', 'spectator', 'be', 'involved.Moreover', 'almost', 'book', 'characters', 'appeared', 'film', 'second', 'only', 'disappearing', 'forever', 'only', 'crowded', 'film', 'left', 'residue', 'unsatisfaction', 'expect', 'story', 'line', 'develop', 'somehow', 'connection', 'newly', 'introduced', 'character', 'True', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'disposal', 'well', 'then', 'know', 'big', 'volumes', 'transferred', 'film', 'media', 'losing', 'impact', 'director', 'wanted', 'introduce', 'new', 'different', 'interpretation', 'story', 'succeded', 'only', 'modernizing', 'dialogue', 'changing', 'visual', 'style', 'message', 'quite', 'weaker', 'original.On', 'whole', 'pleasant', 'production', 'deserve', 'apprisal', 'picture', 'mostly', 'However', 'impeccable', 'version', 'book', 'been', 'already', 'made', '1995', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'what', 'point', 'remaking', 'perfect']",N/A

My favorite actress Keira Knightley plays the witty and head-strong Elizabeth Bennett, the second eldest of five daughters who come from a modest family. The daughters have reached marriagable age, and when the handsome, wealthy Mr. Bingley comes to town, of course the whole household flies into an uproar. Elizabeth's older and stunningly beautiful sister Jane (who is played by Audrey Tautou look-alike Rosamund Pike) is established as the inteded for Mr. Bingley. Elizabeth meets her match in Mr. Bingley's best friend, Mr. Darcy, whose dark wit and forlorn manner somehow spark her interest, but when a series of misunderstandings arise that involve her beloved family, Elizabeth must learn to put aside her pride or else risk losing the man who completes her.This movie was exquisite and beautifully directed. The sweeping, epic shots and stunning cinematography served as the perfect backdrop for the delicate love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightley's performance as Elizabeth was so amazing that it should serve as the standard for all romantic heroines. The chemistry created by lingering glances and touches is electrifying, and conveys the love arising bewteen Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy more fully than covert displays of affection that afflict many movies made today.So utterly romantic and heart-felt.

640625,A31T5ANGT3NCDR,B00005JOHI,elena maria vidal,"[2, 3]","Over the years, there have been different film versions of Jane Austen's novel ""Pride and Prejudice."" I enjoy the diverging portrayals of the House of Bennet, where the Salic Law prevails, for new insights into the array of characters can always be gleaned. It is like visiting the same family in different seasons. I must admit that to me the 1995 BBC version was so excellent that I thought nothing else could compare, which is why the viewing of the 2005 rendition was postponed until a couple of days ago. With stunning cinematography and meticulously detailed sets, it is a highly entertaining production. Keira Knightley, although she is too thin for period roles when women were more fleshy, played the part of Elizabeth quite well. The other sisters and Mrs. Bennet were very well-cast. Donald Sutherland utterly stole the show. Sutherland's Mr Bennet seems to be in his own world yet he is really more in tune with everything that is going on than poor distracted Mrs. Bennet. That is especially evident from the way he goes over and comforts poor Mary at the Netherfield ball.The musical score is quite romantic, capturing the desperation of young love obstructed by such obstacles as money and status. The attraction between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is more palpable than ever, although they hardly ever touch except when dancing. Those days of strict boundaries and protocols certainly make for some great love stories.In the 2005 version, the Bennets seem more like yeomen farmers than landed gentry, with pigs running through the house, and shabby dresses. Were the Bennets really that poor? Maybe they were. On the other hand, Mr. Darcy is raised to the peerage, living at Chatsworth like the Duke of Devonshire. The Darcys were a distinguished and wealthy family but I doubt that they had the Elgin marbles in the parlor. This was only a minor distraction (along with the few weak attempts at vulgar humor) in a wonderful film which brings the viewer into the world of the late 1700's, the world of Jane Austen, when young men knelt to ladies when proposing marriage, and being a penniless old maid was the fate worse than death.",4,Visiting the Bennets Once Again,1207440000,"04 6, 2008",2008,2144,"['years', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'film', 'versions', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'enjoy', 'diverging', 'portrayals', 'House', 'Bennet', 'where', 'Salic', 'Law', 'new', 'insights', 'array', 'characters', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'gleaned', 'visiting', 'same', 'family', 'different', 'seasons', 'must', 'admit', '1995', 'BBC', 'version', 'was', 'so', 'excellent', 'thought', 'nothing', 'else', 'could', 'compare', 'why', 'viewing', '2005', 'rendition', 'was', 'postponed', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'meticulously', 'detailed', 'sets', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'production', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'too', 'thin', 'period', 'roles', 'when', 'women', 'were', 'more', 'fleshy', 'played', 'part', 'Elizabeth', 'quite', 'well', 'other', 'sisters', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'were', 'very', 'well-cast', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'utterly', 'stole', 'show', 'Sutherland', 'Mr', 'Bennet', 'be', 'own', 'world', 'yet', 'really', 'more', 'tune', 'everything', 'going', 'poor', 'distracted', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'especially', 'evident', 'way', 'comforts', 'poor', 'Mary', 'Netherfield', 'ball.The', 'musical', 'score', 'quite', 'romantic', 'capturing', 'desperation', 'young', 'love', 'obstructed', 'such', 'obstacles', 'money', 'status', 'attraction', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'more', 'palpable', 'ever', 'hardly', 'ever', 'touch', 'when', 'dancing', 'days', 'strict', 'boundaries', 'certainly', 'make', 'great', 'love', 'stories.In', '2005', 'version', 'Bennets', 'seem', 'more', 'yeomen', 'farmers', 'landed', 'gentry', 'pigs', 'running', 'house', 'shabby', 'dresses', 'Were', 'Bennets', 'really', 'poor', 'Maybe', 'were', 'other', 'hand', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'raised', 'peerage', 'living', 'Chatsworth', 'Duke', 'Devonshire', 'Darcys', 'were', 'distinguished', 'wealthy', 'family', 'doubt', 'had', 'Elgin', 'marbles', 'parlor', 'was', 'only', 'minor', 'distraction', 'few', 'weak', 'attempts', 'vulgar', 'humor', 'wonderful', 'film', 'viewer', 'world', 'late', '1700', 'world', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'when', 'young', 'men', 'knelt', 'ladies', 'when', 'proposing', 'marriage', 'being', 'penniless', 'old', 'maid', 'was', 'fate', 'worse', 'death']",N/A
640626,A1BY89JC6JOAC5,B00005JOHI,Eliza Bennet,"[0, 0]","A charming, wonderful movie in its own right.  Brilliantly cast, and well acted.  I loved it.  It captures the essence of Pride and Prejudice.  I didn't want it to end when it was over.  It was filmed beautifully.  And if it wasn't my favorite book, if I didn't know the story so well, I probably wouldn't have noticed the `rushing' through the storyline.  Feelings aren't developed, can't be developed, within this kind of a short format.  Circumstances and emotions that took days, weeks, or months to develop in the book seem to transpire instantaneously in this movie.  The passage of time is not well represented.  Some characters that definitely add depth are cut out of the plot completely.  Where is Mr. Hurst, for example, eating, drinking, and sleeping to excess?  Mrs. Hurst?  Charlotte's sister Maria?  Aunt Phillips?  Mr. Collins doesn't get to develop his idiosyncracies appropriately.  And my favorite narcissist of all time, Lady Catherine De Bourgh, played by a phenomenal actress this time out (Dame Judi Dench), doesn't get to fuss, brag, and command as she ought.  If you want the nuance, the humor, and the character development, you have to read the original book or watch either the BBC or the A&E production.  However, this was a delightful movie taken alone, without comparison.  This adaption would be an especially good introduction to Pride and Prejudice.

640627,A3BFKY618DR43K,B00005JOHI,Elizabeth A. Root,"[17, 28]","Someone on another website (I regret that I cannot give the reference) commented aptly that in this movie, Longbourne looks  like Stella Gibbons'Cold Comfort Farm (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition).  This was an amusing enough costume flick, but a pretty poor interpretation ofPride and Prejudice (Bantam Classics)so I recommend that Jane Austen fans tell themselves that they are not watching the Bennets, they are watching the Georgian-era Starkadders.  (I strongly recommend the offbeat Cold Comfort Farm as both a novel and a movie:Cold Comfort Farm).The problem with this movie is not so much that it is short, but that what is retained is frequently rendered inane.  Instead of handing his letter to Lizzie while she is out walking, the half-dressed Darcy breaks into the Collins' house in the middle of the night and surprises nightgown-clad Lizzie in her dark bedroom (and she doesn't even scream.)  One of the pivotal scenes in the book is Lizzie Bennet's hearing praise of Darcy from his housekeeper.  This is eliminated in favor of a dopy scene of her wandering around a collection of marble nudes, as if perhaps, the problem was with her libido and this fixed it.  The corny last scene made me glad the movie was ending.  I have read that this is not in the British edition; perhaps they are still trying to punish Americans for the revolution.  In addition, someone apparently decided that it would be hysterically funny if people were constantly interrupting the Bennets.  So instead of Mr. Collins proposing after breakfast, he starts his proposal during breakfast and Mrs. Bennet makes everyone but Lizzie leave the table.  Darcy wakes everyone up before dawn to ask for Lizzie's hand - I don't recommend this as a way to endear yourself to prospective in-laws.  Lady Catherine shows up in the middle of the night, wakes up all the Bennets, and then has it out with Lizzie in front of her family - really smooth and discreet.  People in this era avoided driving at night when they could - they didn't have halogen street lights all over the place, it was very dark at night and travelling could be very dangerous.The depiction of the period is very uneven.  I had a bad feeling about this movie when I saw the tie-in book featuring Darcy walking around half-dressed, looking a lot more like Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights.  I cannot understand the argument that this is a modern retelling when it is still set in the Regency.  Or that it is somehow more suited to a present-day audience than the A&E; (Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)) and BBC (Pride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980)) productions.  There are a number of novels that have rewritten Pride and Prejudice as a contemporary story - why not do one of those if modern is what one is after?CluelessandBride and Prejudicewere certainly fresh, modern retellings of Austen's work, and I loved both of them, but I don't see how those adjectives apply to this film.  I don't understand why filmmakers use material for which they obviously have little sympathy.  Something by the Brontes would probably have been more compatible.There were some things that I thought were well done.  I am not an expert, but I believe that, in this era when most clothes were custom made and relatively expensive, it was common for older people to wear the fashions of their youth, so I actually found that an interesting part of the representation.  I understand that this is supposed to be 1800, or earlier, and the typical Regency dress was originally considered to be quite shocking. As to the status of the Bennets, on the one hand, the greater sophistication of Caroline Bingley's clothing (except for that anachronistic slip dress) vice the clothing of the Bennets' and their neighbors is a realistic representation of the difference in their lifestyles.  The Bingley's are wealthier and spend more time in London; the Bennets probably rely on local seamstresses, and are just a touch behind in fashion.  Some of the Bennets' clothing was a bit grubby, but perhaps that was how country people dressed for solitary walks.  The moviemakers do seem to be a little confused as to what qualified as suitable dress for public appearances.  One can imagine that the difference in decoration at Longbourne and Netherfield partly represents the difference between landed gentry with generations of occupancy and heirlooms that no-one wants to throw out, and the nouveau riche who, starting from scratch, use the very latest fashion.  Everything about the Bennets and their neighbors ought to seem a trifle rustic and old-fashioned, just not lower class.On the other hand, the Bennets have a very good income for a ""gentleman"", and I sincerely doubt that the barnyard was up against the house or that the Bennets spent much time tending the livestock.  There's not much point to having pigs (which are notoriously smelly) right by the house unless one is personally slopping the hogs, and the Bennets had farmworkers.  I suppose that the filmmakers used this to indicate the precarious position of the sisters rather than explaining that in addition to the entail, their parents were too irresponsible to save money out of their income for dowries.  Earthier is not necessarily more realistic.Given the amount of material that had to be omitted, I cannot imagine why we spent so much time gazing at bushes.  If I were editting the movie, the scene of Lizzie walking across the field to the house would be the first to go.  It's cliched, a waste of time, and I've seen much better photography of the English landscape.So, I recommend this to lovers of costume drama who can keep the original novel out of their heads, or people who have never read the novel in the first place.On the entry for the movie showtimes, there is a review: ""A Tender, Beautifully-Filmed Prequel to ""The Clampetts""', January 1, 2006, by Carol M.

640631,AGZEF6W4ASE49,B00005JOHI,Eliza Green,"[6, 10]","**** 3.5 Stars ****How to begin?I bought this movie because I truly enjoyed the novel, and then had the opportunity to purchase the BBC Production, which was beautifully told, and I thought, I have to see how they handle this in a very short (comparatively speaking) 2+ hour movie....As I watched the movie, I began to contemplate it in comparison with the great piece of literature that it is based upon, and found many discrepancies, and liberties taken....  And as I progressed through the movie, I had to keep reminding myself that it is not the retelling from the book, but rather an adaptation.However, even with that in mind, there were things I had a hard time looking past - most importantly, almost every characater, with the possible exception of Elizabeth and Darcy, were caricatures of their literary selves, everything they said and did appeared so (at times) over the top....As others have mentioned, there was definitely a more modern approach to propriety (i.e. Bingley entering the sick room, Lizzy and Darcy speaking in the morning hours in their bedclothes, Lady Catherine's night time visit, the various members of the Bennet family constantly eavesdropping whenever they can in such an uncircumspect manner, characters addressing each other by their Christian names, sleeveless dresses, etc.)With the costuming, and some of the locations, there were times where I felt like I was in Colonial America and not Regency England, and the actors definitely appeared less genteel than they were intended to appear in the book....The movie can be at times very melodramatic (think of the carriage ride back to Longbourn with Aunt and Uncle Gardiner and how dark and depressing it is outside - amazing how it suits her feelings... but is it really necessary?). And, can ANYBODY tell me what was up with that tree that Lizzy, her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner stopped at to rest while the carriage was being worked on prior to going to Pemberly?Having thus laid out some of my obstacles with this movie, I have to say that as an ADAPTATION from the novel, it does have its own merit...  The acting is great for the way the screenplay was written, and some of the creative things that were done, like the scene of Bingley interacting with Darcy to 'rehearse' his proposal to Jane, were fun to watch, even if it didn't 'agree' with the book.I encourage all to watch this with the full knowledge that it is MERELY AN ADAPTATION of the novel, not a retelling.... It is much easier to appreciate this as its own story, separate from the book and the BBC production of 1995.  Indeed, once I got past trying to compare it with either the book or the aforementioned BBC production, it was fun and enjoyable to watch!",3,Adaptation is the Key word,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2714,"['****', '3.5', 'Stars', '****How', 'begin', 'bought', 'movie', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'novel', 'then', 'had', 'opportunity', 'purchase', 'BBC', 'Production', 'was', 'beautifully', 'told', 'thought', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'handle', 'very', 'short', 'comparatively', 'speaking', '2+', 'hour', 'movie', '.As', 'watched', 'movie', 'began', 'contemplate', 'comparison', 'great', 'piece', 'literature', 'based', 'found', 'many', 'discrepancies', 'liberties', 'taken', 'progressed', 'movie', 'had', 'keep', 'reminding', 'not', 'retelling', 'book', 'rather', 'adaptation.However', 'even', 'mind', 'were', 'things', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'looking', 'past', 'most', 'importantly', 'almost', 'characater', 'possible', 'exception', 'Elizabeth', 'Darcy', 'were', 'caricatures', 'literary', 'selves', 'everything', 'said', 'did', 'appeared', 'so', 'times', 'top', '.As', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'was', 'definitely', 'more', 'modern', 'approach', 'propriety', 'i.e', 'Bingley', 'entering', 'sick', 'room', 'Lizzy', 'Darcy', 'speaking', 'morning', 'hours', 'bedclothes', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'night', 'time', 'visit', 'various', 'members', 'Bennet', 'family', 'constantly', 'eavesdropping', 'whenever', 'can', 'such', 'uncircumspect', 'manner', 'characters', 'addressing', 'other', 'Christian', 'names', 'sleeveless', 'dresses', 'etc', 'costuming', 'locations', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'felt', 'was', 'Colonial', 'America', 'not', 'Regency', 'England', 'actors', 'definitely', 'appeared', 'less', 'genteel', 'were', 'intended', 'appear', 'book', '.The', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'times', 'very', 'melodramatic', 'think', 'carriage', 'ride', 'back', 'Longbourn', 'Aunt', 'Uncle', 'Gardiner', 'how', 'dark', 'depressing', 'outside', 'amazing', 'how', 'suits', 'feelings', 'really', 'necessary', 'can', 'ANYBODY', 'tell', 'was', 'up', 'tree', 'Lizzy', 'Aunt', 'Uncle', 'Gardiner', 'stopped', 'rest', 'carriage', 'was', 'being', 'worked', 'prior', 'going', 'Pemberly', 'Having', 'thus', 'laid', 'out', 'obstacles', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'ADAPTATION', 'novel', 'have', 'own', 'merit', 'acting', 'great', 'way', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'creative', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'scene', 'Bingley', 'interacting', 'Darcy', ""'rehearse"", 'proposal', 'Jane', 'were', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", ""'agree"", 'book.I', 'encourage', 'watch', 'full', 'knowledge', 'MERELY', 'AN', 'ADAPTATION', 'novel', 'not', 'retelling', 'much', 'easier', 'appreciate', 'own', 'story', 'separate', 'book', 'BBC', 'production', '1995', 'Indeed', 'once', 'got', 'past', 'trying', 'compare', 'book', 'aforementioned', 'BBC', 'production', 'was', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'watch']",N/A

I did not like 1995's version of Pride and Prejudice with Ehle and Firth because I felt it too shrill, and after a while Ehle's exaggerated facial expressions became annoying. I felt that the actors whom she was laughing at or thinking about had to be in a coma not to notice them.Having said that I watched this version twice and still I could not get past the lack of chemistry between the two leads, and the camera movements which were dizzying.  The first dance sequence, the swing sequence in the farm yard, the soldiers marching through town, I felt that something was always moving in front of the actors obscuring them, and that the eye was constantly trying to find them in the picture.When Tom Hollander showed up at the front door here was yet another scene where half an actor's face was cut off until he moves to the left.  A camera angle stolen right from Polanski's Rosemary's Baby.  Finally I felt it all too forced - especially the endless giggling and laughter.I did love Dame Judy Dench who was severe and the cinematography and locations were outstanding which makes this purchase worth while at the current price.

640637,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B00005JOHI,Emily Todd,"[13, 21]","Over the years Hollywood has produced innumerable romantic comedies in which two people, obviously attracted to (and perfect for) one another, are kept apart by circumstances for a couple of hours until the artificial barriers between them are torn down and they wind up in each other's arms. Most of them have been terrible, but British director Joe Wright's new version of the Jane Austen tale which is the granddaddy of them all proves that if you only return to the source, and treat it if not with absolute fidelity at least with respect, the experience can be delightful. This is a lively, colorful, intelligent retelling of the template for all the later books and movies about two people obviously destined to be together who remain apart all too long due to misunderstandings and the machinations of others. Its sensibility is more modern than Austen's, of course, but that doesn't mean it's any less enjoyable on its own.At just a bit over two hours, this ""Pride and Prejudice"" can't include as much of the detail of Austen's original as the well-regarded five-hour BBC mini-series of 1995, which starred Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. But in Deborah Moggach's skillful adaptation it contains enough to convey the flavor of the book, as well as the basic plot, very successfully, though the tone is more overtly romantic; in this respect it's certainly the equal of the famous 1940 film with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier. And Wright proves remarkably adept at infusing the action not only with the serenity and charm it needs, but with lightness and vivacity as well, an effect achieved especially by his penchant for fast-moving tracking shots, beautifully managed by cinematographer Roman Osin. Osin's luscious widescreen images have the benefit of focusing on lovely locations and utterly convincing period accouterments; the production design by Sarah Greenwood, art direction by Ian Baille, Mark Swain and Nick Gottschalk, set decoration by Katie Spencer and costumes by Jacqueline Durran are all superb. One could spend one's time just luxuriating in the visual splendor on the screen, made even happier by Dario Marianelli's pleasantly evocative score.But the meat of the story is in the characters, of course, and here too the film proves outstanding. Keira Knightley makes ample amends for her dreadful performance in ""Domino"" by portraying the strong-willed, level-headed Elizabeth Bennet as a young woman of both (dare one say it) spunk and an undercurrent of melancholy. Matthew Macfadyen, happily not a conventionally handsome sort, matches her by capturing Darcy's aristocratic demeanor and his inner conflict nicely. Together they make a couple that emphasizes the youthfulness and relative inexperience of Austen's creations far more than was the case in any of the previous filmizations--which makes the tale not only more credible but somehow more poignant. Their excellence doesn't stand alone; the supporting cast is superb, too, with Donald Sutherland wonderfully unruffled and sardonic as the put-upon Mr. Bennet and Brenda Blethyn keeping his wife--an unsophisticated woman obsessed with finding husbands for her many daughters, and a character that can easily become an irritation--within bounds. Rosamund Pike and Simon Woods make an appealing pair as the secondary couple in the mix, Elizabeth's easily-hurt elder sister Jane and Darcy's more ebullient friend Bingley, and Jena Malone is suitably flighty as the immature Lydia, whose infatuation with the handsome but unreliable Wickham (an appropriately smooth Rupert Friend) causes not only a Bennet family crisis but an opportunity that in time will lead to the resolution of the Elizabeth-Darcy impasse. If one can raise any qualifications about the casting, they'd have to concern Tom Hollander, who gives the stiff, obsequious Collins more of a conventionally comic tone than some might wish, and Judi Dench, whose Lady de Bourgh might seem too much the usual intrusive cameo (and whose final scene isn't ideally staged). But you easily become acclimated to them, and in the end they fit Wright's conception.In fact, when looked at as a whole, there's something just a bit miraculous about how enjoyable Wright's film is. ""Pride and Prejudice"" may be the same old story about finding Mr. Right, but this movie shows that if your take on the familiar tale is sufficiently deft, it can be as fresh and enchanting as Austen's book itself must have been in 1813.",5,"""Sometimes the last person on earth you want to be with is the one person you can't be without.""",1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,4455,"['years', 'Hollywood', 'produced', 'innumerable', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'two', 'people', 'obviously', 'attracted', 'perfect', 'one', 'are', 'kept', 'apart', 'circumstances', 'couple', 'hours', 'artificial', 'barriers', 'are', 'torn', 'down', 'wind', 'up', 'other', 'arms', 'Most', 'have', 'been', 'terrible', 'British', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'new', 'version', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'tale', 'granddaddy', 'only', 'return', 'source', 'treat', 'not', 'absolute', 'fidelity', 'least', 'respect', 'experience', 'can', 'be', 'delightful', 'lively', 'colorful', 'intelligent', 'retelling', 'template', 'later', 'books', 'movies', 'two', 'people', 'obviously', 'destined', 'be', 'together', 'who', 'remain', 'apart', 'too', 'long', 'due', 'misunderstandings', 'machinations', 'others', 'sensibility', 'more', 'modern', 'Austen', 'course', ""n't"", 'mean', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'own.At', 'just', 'bit', 'two', 'hours', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'include', 'much', 'detail', 'Austen', 'original', 'well-regarded', 'five-hour', 'BBC', 'mini-series', '1995', 'starred', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Deborah', 'Moggach', 'skillful', 'adaptation', 'enough', 'convey', 'flavor', 'book', 'as', 'well', 'basic', 'plot', 'very', 'successfully', 'tone', 'more', 'overtly', 'romantic', 'respect', 'certainly', 'equal', 'famous', '1940', 'film', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Wright', 'remarkably', 'adept', 'infusing', 'action', 'not', 'only', 'serenity', 'charm', 'lightness', 'vivacity', 'as', 'well', 'effect', 'achieved', 'especially', 'penchant', 'fast-moving', 'tracking', 'shots', 'beautifully', 'managed', 'cinematographer', 'Roman', 'Osin', 'Osin', 'luscious', 'widescreen', 'images', 'have', 'benefit', 'focusing', 'lovely', 'locations', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'period', 'accouterments', 'production', 'design', 'Sarah', 'Greenwood', 'art', 'direction', 'Ian', 'Baille', 'Mark', 'Swain', 'Nick', 'Gottschalk', 'set', 'decoration', 'Katie', 'Spencer', 'costumes', 'Jacqueline', 'Durran', 'are', 'superb', 'One', 'could', 'spend', 'one', 'time', 'just', 'luxuriating', 'visual', 'splendor', 'screen', 'made', 'even', 'happier', 'Dario', 'Marianelli', 'pleasantly', 'evocative', 'score.But', 'meat', 'story', 'characters', 'course', 'here', 'too', 'film', 'outstanding', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'ample', 'amends', 'dreadful', 'performance', 'Domino', 'portraying', 'strong-willed', 'level-headed', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'young', 'woman', 'dare', 'one', 'say', 'spunk', 'undercurrent', 'melancholy', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'happily', 'not', 'conventionally', 'handsome', 'sort', 'capturing', 'Darcy', 'aristocratic', 'demeanor', 'inner', 'conflict', 'nicely', 'Together', 'make', 'couple', 'youthfulness', 'relative', 'inexperience', 'Austen', 'creations', 'far', 'more', 'was', 'case', 'previous', 'filmizations', 'tale', 'not', 'only', 'more', 'credible', 'somehow', 'more', 'poignant', 'excellence', ""n't"", 'stand', 'alone', 'supporting', 'cast', 'superb', 'too', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'wonderfully', 'unruffled', 'sardonic', 'put-upon', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'keeping', 'wife', 'unsophisticated', 'woman', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'husbands', 'many', 'daughters', 'character', 'can', 'easily', 'become', 'irritation', 'bounds', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Simon', 'Woods', 'make', 'appealing', 'pair', 'secondary', 'couple', 'mix', 'Elizabeth', 'easily-hurt', 'elder', 'sister', 'Jane', 'Darcy', 'more', 'ebullient', 'friend', 'Bingley', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'suitably', 'flighty', 'immature', 'Lydia', 'infatuation', 'handsome', 'unreliable', 'Wickham', 'appropriately', 'smooth', 'Rupert', 'Friend', 'not', 'only', 'Bennet', 'family', 'crisis', 'opportunity', 'time', 'will', 'lead', 'resolution', 'Elizabeth-Darcy', 'impasse', 'one', 'can', 'raise', 'qualifications', 'casting', ""'d"", 'have', 'concern', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'who', 'stiff', 'obsequious', 'Collins', 'more', 'conventionally', 'comic', 'tone', 'might', 'wish', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Lady', 'de', 'Bourgh', 'might', 'seem', 'too', 'much', 'usual', 'intrusive', 'cameo', 'final', 'scene', ""n't"", 'ideally', 'staged', 'easily', 'become', 'acclimated', 'end', 'fit', 'Wright', 'conception.In', 'fact', 'when', 'looked', 'whole', 'something', 'just', 'bit', 'miraculous', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'Wright', 'film', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'may', 'be', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'finding', 'Mr', 'Right', 'movie', 'take', 'familiar', 'tale', 'sufficiently', 'deft', 'can', 'be', 'fresh', 'enchanting', 'Austen', 'book', 'must', 'have', 'been', '1813']",N/A

Look no further than Pride and Prejudice, one of the greatest love stories ever told and the original template for essentially every modern chick-flick or romantic comedy to come henceforth.At first I thought the movie was rather talky and somewhat boring, but the more i watched and the more I paid attention, I started to realize that this is one of the most engaging and accurately lavish English period pieces I have ever seen before.But it is not for everyone.  Certainly notsomuch as Atonement is for more general audiences or more easily digestible.  This film requires a more expert level of movie watching/comprehension and a certain degree of literary aptitude.  It begs for, nay demands the viewers active participation, involvement, and a certain commitment of attention more novice pieces would dare not request.  And by literary aptitude I don't necessarily mean the source novel as much as I mean Shakespeare.  The characters relate and converse in a pseudo-Shakespearean manner minus the iambic pentameter.  If you cannot keep up with all of the double entendras, doublespeak, subliminal messages and the like you will likely have a difficult time appreciating the genius of this screenplay written by Deborah Moggach.The complicated relationships and plot are also like a Shakespearan comedy (all though at times feels like a tragedy) and it is very easy to get left behind if you are not of to task.  This is why I enjoyed the movie so much.  You need to pay full attention to fully appreciate this work of art.  Visually there were many hidden cues like actors' not-always-so-obvious facial expressions as well as unspoken hints from the brilliant, however also purposeful wardrobe and costume design.  It's very difficult to explain in a simple way, but I simply love this director's work; Joe Wright is stupid genius!What a guilty pleasure for a moviephille for me to watch.And let us not even mention the name Keira Knightley.  This is the film that finally put her on the map as a serious actress to be reckoned with and not just another pretty face.  She thoroughly shines throughout as the star and primary protagonist of the movie.Director Joe Wright's second motion picture 'Atonement' was extrmely good, a modern classic in its own right, but it was not exactly a happy story.  It did not make me smile inside as the subtle and not-so-subtle humor like P&P; did.  This one was more a romp that leaves one giddy so giddyup!note:  This was my first treatment of P&P.;  I never saw any other version or read the book, but now I have decided to gobble up all of Jane Austen's other famous works and find myself feverishly awaiting Joe Wright's forthcoming film 'The Soloist'My Addendum:I have been perusing the 1 star reviews that are speckeled among the many praising and applauding reviews of this movie and I just wanted to say something to address those naysayers.  First of all, I think you all have lost much prospective and are waging your 1 star rating for hyperbolic effect.  And second, if all of you who loathed this adaptation were in charge of all other adaptations in Hollywood, movies would just plain suck and not really be viable or marketable at all.  Thank goodness this is not the state of things.  It is more palatable movies such as this that satisfy the masses that draw in new viewers to your precious A&E;/BBC version or bring in new readers to the original novel.  Is that such a horrible thing?  I swear so many rabid Austen fans think P&P; was written only for them and belongs to them and if it isn't the approved 1995 edition of the miniseries, well then thee be damned.  Chill out already and stop trying to ruin it for the rest of us.  You should all be thanking the director Joe Wright because thanks to him (eventually) more people in the world will get to know who the heck Colin Firth even is!",5,Wordgasms ensue,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,3961,"['How', 'would', 'teens', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'recent', 'Juno', 'speak', 'were', 'English', 'year', '1797', 'Look', 'further', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'one', 'greatest', 'love', 'stories', 'ever', 'told', 'original', 'template', 'essentially', 'modern', 'chick-flick', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'come', 'henceforth.At', 'first', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'rather', 'talky', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'more', 'i', 'watched', 'more', 'paid', 'attention', 'started', 'realize', 'one', 'most', 'engaging', 'accurately', 'lavish', 'English', 'period', 'pieces', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'before.But', 'not', 'everyone', 'Certainly', 'notsomuch', 'Atonement', 'more', 'general', 'audiences', 'more', 'easily', 'digestible', 'film', 'more', 'expert', 'level', 'movie', 'watching/comprehension', 'certain', 'degree', 'literary', 'aptitude', 'nay', 'viewers', 'active', 'participation', 'involvement', 'certain', 'commitment', 'attention', 'more', 'novice', 'pieces', 'would', 'dare', 'not', 'request', 'literary', 'aptitude', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'mean', 'source', 'novel', 'as', 'much', 'mean', 'Shakespeare', 'characters', 'relate', 'converse', 'pseudo-Shakespearean', 'manner', 'iambic', 'pentameter', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'up', 'double', 'entendras', 'doublespeak', 'subliminal', 'messages', 'like', 'will', 'likely', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'appreciating', 'genius', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Deborah', 'Moggach.The', 'complicated', 'relationships', 'plot', 'are', 'also', 'Shakespearan', 'comedy', 'though', 'times', 'feels', 'tragedy', 'very', 'easy', 'get', 'left', 'are', 'not', 'task', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'need', 'pay', 'full', 'attention', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'work', 'art', 'Visually', 'were', 'many', 'hidden', 'cues', 'actors', 'not-always-so-obvious', 'facial', 'expressions', 'as', 'well', 'unspoken', 'hints', 'brilliant', 'however', 'also', 'purposeful', 'wardrobe', 'costume', 'design', 'very', 'difficult', 'explain', 'simple', 'way', 'simply', 'love', 'director', 'work', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'stupid', 'genius', 'What', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'moviephille', 'watch.And', 'let', 'not', 'even', 'mention', 'name', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'film', 'finally', 'put', 'map', 'serious', 'actress', 'be', 'reckoned', 'not', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'thoroughly', 'shines', 'star', 'primary', 'protagonist', 'movie.Director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'second', 'motion', 'picture', 'was', 'extrmely', 'good', 'modern', 'classic', 'own', 'right', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'happy', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'smile', 'inside', 'subtle', 'not-so-subtle', 'humor', 'P', 'P', 'did', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'romp', 'one', 'giddy', 'so', 'giddyup', 'note', 'was', 'first', 'treatment', 'P', 'P', 'never', 'saw', 'other', 'version', 'read', 'book', 'now', 'have', 'decided', 'gobble', 'up', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'other', 'famous', 'works', 'find', 'feverishly', 'awaiting', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'forthcoming', 'film', ""Soloist'My"", 'Addendum', 'have', 'been', 'perusing', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'are', 'speckeled', 'many', 'praising', 'applauding', 'reviews', 'movie', 'just', 'wanted', 'say', 'something', 'address', 'naysayers', 'First', 'think', 'have', 'lost', 'much', 'prospective', 'are', 'waging', '1', 'star', 'rating', 'hyperbolic', 'effect', 'second', 'who', 'loathed', 'adaptation', 'were', 'charge', 'other', 'adaptations', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'would', 'just', 'plain', 'suck', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'viable', 'marketable', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'not', 'state', 'things', 'more', 'palatable', 'movies', 'such', 'masses', 'draw', 'new', 'viewers', 'precious', 'A', 'E', '/BBC', 'version', 'bring', 'new', 'readers', 'original', 'novel', 'horrible', 'thing', 'swear', 'so', 'many', 'rabid', 'Austen', 'fans', 'think', 'P', 'P', 'was', 'written', 'only', 'belongs', ""n't"", 'approved', '1995', 'edition', 'miniseries', 'well', 'then', 'thee', 'be', 'damned', 'Chill', 'out', 'already', 'stop', 'trying', 'ruin', 'rest', 'should', 'all', 'be', 'thanking', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'thanks', 'eventually', 'more', 'people', 'world', 'will', 'get', 'know', 'who', 'heck', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'even']",N/A
640646,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B00005JOHI,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[12, 19]","Superb casting, outstanding scenery, well designed period settings and a brilliantly written novel by Jane Austen comes to life making this a block buster winner and one of the hottest films this season. The film is likely to garner several well deserved Academy Awards ... I love the realistic country scenes and the opulent wealth of the era as depicted in this film. Keira Knightly is charming and dazzling as the intelligent and articulate Lizzie who is transformed within this film, becoming the butterfly that arises from her unique chrysallis. Matthew MacFadyen is the perfect Mr. Darcy, a darkly handsome introspective, intelligent gentleman ... who is easily misunderstood.Keira Knightly is an outstandng Elizabeth (Lizzie) Bennett, with her well chiseled lovely porcelain facial features, beautiful large brown expressive eyes, lovely swan-like neck and gorgeous brown hair, often worn pulled up and back, with tendrils framing her face. Her clever articulate observations and quips are very memorable throughout the film as she challenges the quietly brooding and handsome Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen). One memorable scene is when the guests of honor, Mr. Bingley, his sister and Mr. Darcy arrive in the ballroom, the dancing and music stop as the people part to each side, like a zipper being unzipped. Mr. Bingley happily joins in the dancing and socializing but both Miss Bingley and Mr. Darcy remain aloof, quietly commenting on the differences between living in the city and country. It is quite obvious they feel  superior compared to the locals. Mr. Bingley laughs and smiles as he dances with Miss Jane Bennett (Rosamund Pike). Her mother, Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Blethyn,) is delighted by this good fortune. She is actively seeking a husband for Jane who is of marriagable age and the eldest daughter of five.During an intermission Lizzie over hears Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy discussing Jane and herself. Mr Darcy describes Lizzie as ""tolerable"" but essentially not his type. This phrase will eventually come to haunt him, as Lizzie repeats it to him  later during an encounter. Based on this event, she develops preconceived notions about Mr. Darcy's character and manners. She makes no secret of her feelings about him to her family.Jane pays a social visit to the Bingley's country mansion and becomes ill, requiring her to stay as an overnight guest for several days until she recovers. Mr. Bingley can not hide his joy at having such a pretty and desirable house guest. Lizzie visits her sister during the illness and encounters Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley. She engages Mr. Darcy in several verbal duels and cleverly exchanges challenging words, demonstrating superior skill and prowess in the intellectual game of quoting poetry and verse. Both Keira Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen perfom their roles superbly ...While Mr. Bingley was falling in love with Jane and quietly making his feelings known, his sister suddenly closed the manor house and persuaded him and her entourage to return to London. It is obvious she wanted to sever the budding relationship between her brother and Jane, before it became serious. Essentially, Miss Jane Bennett was viewed as a social inferior. About this time, the Reverend Mr. Collins came calling on the Bennetts, with the intention of marrying one of the daughters. He lived on an estate owned by Lady Catherine, who required him to find a wife before she would finance a parsonage and church for him. Lizzie captured his attention but she outright rejected his proposal. Following this refusal, Mr. Collins offered marriage to Charlotte their young housekeeper, who accepted him. Lizzie could not understand why Charlotte would marry Mr. Collins until the realities of Charlotte's situation sunk in. Charlotte explained he had a stable profession and provided her a home which was a major improvement from her current situation. Lizzie slowly awakened into adulthood, recognizing many unpleasant facts of life. The scenes went from comedy to almost tragedy as different events unfolded in the lives of the Bennett family. The importance of social position and wealth in selecting a life partner was clear and evident.It never dawned on the Bennett's that the sudden departure of the Bingley's was meant as a snub, a refusal of Miss Jane Bennett as a fiance. The Bennetts had high hopes of relighting the match and sent Jane to visit an Aunt in London in hopes of meeting Mr. Bingley. About this time, Lizzie was visiting Brighton with her relatives when she took a tour of Mr. Darcy's residence which was open for public viewing. She met him unexpectedly in the garden and received a declaration of love which took her completely by surprise. She immediately dismissed it and rejected him ...Jane returned from London without having established any social connection with Mr. Bingley. Lizzie returned from Brighton, in an unusual emotional state, a totally confused frame of mind. Unknown to herself, she was battling unresolved feelings for Mr. Darcy. A family crisis arose when Lydia, the middle daughter, had run away with a soldier. This scandal would ruin the Bennett's chances for marrying off Jane and Lizzie to good families. Help came from an unexpected source: Mr. Darcy had known this soldier in the past. Mr. Darcy's father had treated the soldier nearly like a son. Due to nearly similar circumstances involving Mr. Darcy's sister Georgiana, he rescued Lydia from her shameful situation by setting them up finanacially and ensuring Lydia married her soldier. When Lizzie heard of this matter, she remained in a deep quagmire for having rejected his overtures of love, she was awakening to the true nature of his character and discovered herself attracted to him. The resolution to Lizzie's emotional conflict and the rematch between Jane and Mr. Bingley is what makes the book and this film so popular. Jane Austen's classical writing via this new film adaptation provides a creative twist to the eternal conundrum which young ladies and young gentlemen of every era and generation must face and resolve anew for themselves.Erika Borsos (erikab93)",5,Jane Austen's Classical Yin/Yang Conundrum,1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,6122,"['Superb', 'casting', 'outstanding', 'scenery', 'well', 'designed',

Because of that, I put off for a very long time until just recently watching this version. First, I did not think the actors could possibly measure up and second, it is an abridged version, so a great deal of the story would inevitably be sacrificed. I had also heard about the infamous kiss at the end of this version.I am happy to report that I enjoyed this film for its own sake. Relatively short though it is, Macfadyen and Knightley offer a lovely take on the romance. They are both very attractive people who are young enough to be very near the actual ages of the characters, and their chemistry is wonderful.

If you want a good laugh - go see this. Although it's more likely you'll laugh AT it than with it. I realize they were extremely pressed for time, and in light of that I do give them some credit for what they tried to do. However.......My main quarrel is with Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy, who is wooden and awkward (and I don't compare him with Colin Firth - this is how he truly is without comparison)I read in a review that Mcfadyen did not read the book before they began shooting. What a mistake! Maybe if he had, he should have done more justice to the character and the movie.Secondly: Keira Knightly, who i'm afraid is just another pretty face. She cannot play Elizabeth, most of the movie she walks around with an artificial smile, and when in doubt, tries to play up Lizzy's vivacity by laughing, when nothing is really amusing. True, she was not so gratingly bad as Mr. Mcfadyen, but I think she too, missed the essence of the character.As for the rest of the Bennet clan, I think a former reviewer caught it very well: they are barnyard rustics living in a shabby house, where the daughters are seen baking - then later Mrs. bennet denies that her girls have anything to do in the kitchen! as for the other girls: Jane is lovely, but too shy. Lydia looks more like she should be playing Mary, and vice versa. Mr. Bennet is seen in the book as a sort of indolent country gentleman who is fond of books, in this version we see him taking an active role in the farm, and when he is in the house, trying vainly to be witty. Donald Sutherland was a bad choice.What is most disturbing to me though, is the closing scene, all fans of the book and the A&E; version will agree - this is weird, awkward, and completely uncalled for.

They apparently wanted this version to appeal more to a younger audience. Thus, along with the issues mentioned above, you will also find faster cuts and dialog, scenes in which the characters do things that would be completely unacceptable for the time (Lizzie with her hair completely down, or Darcy walking across fields with his shirt flapping open), and some very strange behavior from the family (Jane allowing a man in her room while she is in her nightdress). Not to mention the blatant attempt to infer sexual innuendo where there simply isn't any. (Seriously? That shot of the pig's...um...boy parts? Lizzie making a very vulgar check of Wickham's rear? ...Was the director influenced by a 13 year old boy?)Knightly's portrayal bugged me more than a little. I couldn't figure out what she was giggling at half the time, and the other half, the character was doing things blatantly out of character for Austen's heroine. I did, however, appreciate the fact that Mrs. Bennet is slightly more lovable in this version.

The creators of this movie, however, took major liberties in their translation of this classic onto the big screen.I had high hopes for this movie, and I anxiously awaited for its release, but it fell completely short of my expectations.  Most of its characters were poorly cast, and the scriptwriters blundered many parts of the plot, re-writing it into nonsense that wouldn't have fit the sentiments and protocols of the era.Mr. Bingley was portrayed like a goofy boy rather than a respectable, good natured gentleman; Caroline Bingley looked more like a runway model on a perpetual high as opposed to a keen, manipulative social climber; Georgiana Darcy was bubbly and extrovert instead of being painfully shy; Mr. Collins was wooden and dull as opposed to being an obsequiously wily toadie (he was funny, though, I'll give him that); Darcy was portrayed as utterly misunderstood without pride, when we know that Darcy was definitely proud; and, though Keira Knightley is definitely spirited, she played Lizzie with liveliness and fire, but without the undeniable charm that tempered her faults and compelled us to forgive her trespasses.  Knightley's performance is also a little too forward and she is unable to subdue herself when necessary--basically, it's too modern a portrayal.Other reviewers have already poured over the script blunders, and I agree with most of them, but the ones that really stood out to me were:- Georgiana's wild hair, which was loose and looked absolutely unbrushed, along with her being portrayed as an extrovert.- Lady Catherine's late-night visit, with the entire Bennett clan standing around in their nightwear.- The rainstorm scene where Darcy proposes in clothes that are utterly drenched.- The inconsistencies with the costumes, particularly Lady Catherine's throwbacks and Caroline Bingley's modern, sleeveless numbers.- The inconsistencies with Longbourn.  It was rustic, dingy, and dirty--no doubt to make the Bennett's surroundings look more 'raw'--but they had servants at the ready in nearly every Longbourn scene.This isn't Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice; it's entirely someone else's vision of Pride and Prejudice.  Often times, I would wonder if the creators of the movie and I had even read the same book.  The scriptwriters thought that they had to help the story, that the story the way it is wouldn't work with audiences.  In the end, what was preserved of the original story was the only saving grace, with all the changes made with the plot done in poor taste.I understand that films and books are two entirely different creatures, and that there would be tremendous challenges for any movie seeking to portray a book's worth of material into a 2-hour film.  That, however, still does not excuse the dumbing down of the plot and dialogue.  One reviewer said that the film was too ""obvious,"" and I'm apt to agree.  Even my husband says that the movie was ""P&P; for Dummies.""  The movie was more of a typical romance novel featuring P&P; characters rather than a movie version of our beloved novel.In the end, the A&E; version is still vastly superior.",2,"Hit and miss, but misses more often than hits",1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,3403,"['think', 'story', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'can', 'be', 'improved', 'one', 'can', 'write', 'dialogue', 'better', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'story', 'such', 'help', 'can', 'become', 'accessible', 'case', 'hubris', 'appeal', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'universal', 'characters', 'are', 'timeless', 'creators', 'movie', 'however', 'took', 'major', 'liberties', 'translation', 'classic', 'big', 'screen.I', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'anxiously', 'awaited', 'release', 'fell', 'completely', 'short', 'expectations', 'Most', 'characters', 'were', 'poorly', 'cast', 'scriptwriters', 'blundered', 'many', 'parts', 'plot', 're-writing', 'nonsense', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'fit', 'sentiments', 'protocols', 'era.Mr', 'Bingley', 'was', 'portrayed', 'goofy', 'boy', 'rather', 'respectable', 'good', 'natured', 'gentleman', 'Caroline', 'Bingley', 'looked', 'more', 'runway', 'model', 'perpetual', 'high', 'opposed', 'keen', 'manipulative', 'social', 'climber', 'Georgiana', 'Darcy', 'was', 'bubbly', 'extrovert', 'instead', 'being', 'painfully', 'shy', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'was', 'wooden', 'dull', 'opposed', 'being', 'obsequiously', 'wily', 'toadie', 'was', 'funny', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Darcy', 'was', 'portrayed', 'utterly', 'misunderstood', 'pride', 'when', 'know', 'Darcy', 'was', 'definitely', 'proud', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'definitely', 'spirited', 'played', 'Lizzie', 'liveliness', 'fire', 'undeniable', 'charm', 'tempered', 'faults', 'compelled', 'forgive', 'trespasses', 'Knightley', 'performance', 'also', 'little', 'too', 'forward', 'unable', 'subdue', 'when', 'necessary', 'basically', 'too', 'modern', 'portrayal.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'poured', 'script', 'blunders', 'agree', 'most', 'ones', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'were', 'Georgiana', 'wild', 'hair', 'was', 'loose', 'looked', 'absolutely', 'unbrushed', 'being', 'portrayed', 'extrovert.-', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'late-night', 'visit', 'entire', 'Bennett', 'clan', 'standing', 'around', 'nightwear.-', 'rainstorm', 'scene', 'where', 'Darcy', 'clothes', 'are', 'utterly', 'drenched.-', 'inconsistencies', 'costumes', 'particularly', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'throwbacks', 'Caroline', 'Bingley', 'modern', 'sleeveless', 'numbers.-', 'inconsistencies', 'Longbourn', 'was', 'rustic', 'dingy', 'dirty', 'doubt', 'make', 'Bennett', 'surroundings', 'look', 'more', ""'raw"", 'had', 'servants', 'ready', 'nearly', 'Longbourn', 'scene.This', ""n't"", 'Jane', 'Austen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'entirely', 'someone', 'else', 'vision', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Often', 'would', 'wonder', 'creators', 'movie', 'had', 'even', 'read', 'same', 'book', 'scriptwriters', 'thought', 'had', 'help', 'story', 'story', 'way', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'audiences', 'end', 'what', 'was', 'preserved', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'only', 'saving', 'grace', 'changes', 'made', 'plot', 'done', 'poor', 'taste.I', 'understand', 'films', 'books', 'are', 'two', 'entirely', 'different', 'creatures', 'would', 'be', 'tremendous', 'challenges', 'movie', 'seeking', 'portray', 'book', 'worth', 'material', '2-hour', 'film', 'however', 'still', 'not', 'excuse', 'dumbing', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'One', 'reviewer', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'obvious', ""'m"", 'apt', 'agree', 'Even', 'husband', 'movie', 'was', 'P', 'P', 'Dummies', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'typical', 'romance', 'novel', 'featuring', 'P', 'P', 'characters', 'rather', 'movie', 'version', 'beloved', 'end', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'still', 'vastly', 'superior']",N/A

640664,AY12DBB0U420B,B00005JOHI,Gary Peterson,"[1, 1]","The movie for last night was ""Pride & Prejudice."" I found the DVD in our shelves and apparently it was something that my wife picked up and we failed to watch. Well, its a ""best-film-of-the-year"" type of movie no matter what year it might occur in. Without question. What can I possibly say? This movie already has over 1300 Amazon reviews and about 60% of them are five stars. And a lot of the reviews are exceptionally good. Well, it's a quite touching love story, actually two love stories, but I'm not going to dwell upon it. I'm just going to make a few remarks about things that especially impressed me.One was the setting. Magnificent! Where do they ever find such places in this modern world? The buildings and grounds were just immaculate! It was like being in the best park you could ever imagine. Everything was done to perfection and the photography was amazing. How do they ever manage to get big sweeping panoramic views with out a single power line, roadway or cars showing? Amazing! It really felt as if they had taken you way back to that pre-modern time. Does England have ""preserves"" like this just for the purpose of making classic movies?Secondly, the costumes were excellent! And so elaborate! And no doubt correct for the time. This movie paid attention to the details, believe me. And the interiors of some of the living quarters were just magnificent. Do the Brits really live like this? Well, I guess these were all upper-crust Brits, so I'll let this one pass by. However, any fancier of interior decorations and antiques is just going to be awe-struck by this movie. No expense was spared, and it's not some computer animation trick.Finally, the acting is just first rate. It always takes me a while to adjust to the stiff British methods, but it wasn't long before I felt like a part of the set and I laughed and suffered right along with the members of the cast. Well done! Also, the movie had an exceptionally good musical score. I thought the sound was a little too intrusive and interfered with the dialog here and there, but that's probably because it was set in surround sound and I watched it using a stereo sound system. In any case, this is just an exceptional movie.

Keira, for such a tiny thing, is surpringly forceful and powerful in her prideful portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett.  Her acting style is so natural that you wonder if she was acting at all.  If Reese Witherspoon hadn't won the Oscar, it clearly would have gone to Keira Knightly.  I haven't seen the Colin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice, but this was well done, straighforward yet still cinematically beautiful and pleasant.I'd love to see more of Keira in strong roles which is what she's clearly suited for.  English Rose she may be, but dainty dame she is not.  Clearly a lovely tomboy who can hang with the boys...which acocunts for her solid performance in Bend it Like Beckham. Her off screen persona is not too far off.  When interviewed on the Red Carpet by Isaac Mizrahi, she told him with quick frankness she didn't think she would win.  Mizrahi responded that she needed a plan when her name was called.Keira:  Whether or not I win, I'm going to party afterwards.Mizrahi:  Great!  Who are you going with to the party?Keira: I don't know...I'm just going to...follow people.Now that's how a 20 year old talks.  You could tell she was clearly there to have fun and wasn't taking herself too seriously.Star in the making.  She's got plenty of time for Oscars.

It is quite a visual presentation of the story where dialogue is left unspoken and the power of the images both animate and inanimate speak for themselves. That is not to say that the film goes on without dialogue, but rather quite the opposite. The many exchanges of dialogue are witty, brilliantly structured, eloquently spoken and presented with an economy of style that is concisely intelligent. This film with its intricately mounted visuals and words does an admirable job of bringing this literary work to the screen with all the constraints inherent in the medium of the cinema. Director Joe Wright also did a more than commendable job of representing the two main characters. Keira Knightley gives an awe-inspiring performance as Lizzie giving her great insight of the human condition. Lizzie though impetuous at times has a gift of rationalizing human behavior with a certain sense of reality offsetting loftier romantic ideals thus making her a young woman of keen intelligence. I truly enjoyed Matthew MacFadyen's performance as Darcy. He seems a young man tired and perplexed by convention but knows no other way to conduct himself and is trapped by his by his social status but more importantly by his own upbringing. Matthew MacFadyen's does an exceptional job conveying this. Awkwardly trying to emote his inner feelings he does more to alienate Lizzie than win her affections. MacFadyen's Darcy is truly a man misunderstood. Only through good and anonymous deeds can the true nature of the man prevail.

640670,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JOHI,Grady Harp,"[9, 11]","Some will ask ""how many versions of Jane Austen's read-to-the-point-of-fraying 'Pride and Prejudice' do we need?""  The current film archives show no fewer than ten versions and growing.  But for this viewer the current P & P du jour is as satisfying as any, edited and distilled to its main story lines without diminishing the main message from the author. Deborah Moggach can be thanked for the screenplay (with some subtle revisions by Emma Thompson) and Joe Wright  for his sensitive and forward momentum directing approach.So what make this version different and successful?  First, the placement of the Bennet family in the pig and mud friendly country home that sets the scene properly for the driver of the film - finding proper husbands for the five daughters whose well placed marriages will assure the lower class Bennet family a future stability.  Yes, it is a bit untidy, this household, but that makes it a family more dependent on the land and more prone to dreams of 'marrying up' in a country ruled by class system. Second, the casting of the Bennnet family with five truly young actresses (Keira Knightly, Rosamund Pike, Talulah Riley, Jena Malone, Carey Mulligan) instead of older types trying to appear like teenagers; a mother (Brenda Blethyn) who indeed shows her desperation of class; and a father (Donald Sutherland) who epitomizes Austen's father figure mold.  Add to the Bennets the credible men characters of Simon Woods, Matthew Macfadyen, Tom Hollander, and  Cornelius Booth and top it all off with a pivotal Lady Catherine de Bourg of Judi Dench and all players are in place for a fine cast.  The dialogue is crisp and sharp and the usual diversions into lineage names and sidebars are eliminated, bringing this long story down to just over two hours.The scenery and costumes are superb as is the cinematography by Roman Oshin and the musical score by Dario Marianelli  with a lot of help from Henry Purcell.  Is it one of the best movies of the year?  Perhaps, perhaps not, depending on taste. But it is nice to see Keira Knightly shine in a role more challenging than any she has had to date.  She inhabits Elizabeth Bennet luminously.

640671,A2H9VMR8QRLINY,B00005JOHI,granite,"[8, 13]","I am not British, I haven't seen the BBC version and have no idea of the minutiae of aristocratic surroundings in the UK to be too distressed about the Bennett house. I read the book, but not recently, so I cannot offer a detailed comparison of what was altered. Perhaps because of these factors I was surprised about the mixed reviews this film has gotten.I really liked this film for its emotional intensity, social commentary and beautiful cinematography. Love is unique enough today, when most people's choices are far less circumscribed than in the 19th century. At the time, it was the exception many dreamed about and few experienced, at least in their marriage. Pride and Prejudice is about women's lives, where compromise rules and the rational decision of Charlotte is the order of the day. The necessity of marrying for financial security gives even the most unsuitable men the pick of quite adequate women.The social hierarchy is clear and oppressive and all of us romantics watching it :) root for love to upset it. The pacing of the film allows us to understand the way Lizzy's and Darcy's feelings develop (by contrast, we are told of Jane's and Bingley's feelings, but do not experience them) and although we may know what comes next, we can still hold our breath. When at the end of the film, for example, Darcy comes to visit early in the morning, we watch him approach, rather than cut to him appearing and then talking to Lizzy. An important conversation is given weight by editing. These are the details that give the film its intensity.

640672,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B00005JOHI,Gregor von Kallahann,"[38, 52]","Yes, it's true.  A two-hour movie can't cover as much ground as a five-hour mini-series, and it may be unfair to expect it to.  What is a reasonable demand, however, would be expect the filmmakers to make judicious cuts in the narrative and not to rush, rush, rush through a fairly complex storyline and to run roughshod over the elegant dialogue that the story's original author provided her flawed, but self-aware and articulate characters.This film's failings--when compared to the artistic success of the 1995 BBC series--begs the question as to whether or not a novel this rich and this subtle doesn't deserve a full five or more hours to unfold on film.  Maybe that's the only real way to translate Austen's literary genius successfully to a visual medium.For the first half hour or so, I thought the problem may have just been me.  But when we got to the ""Mr. Collins"" scenes, I knew something internal to the film had gone awry.  The equivalent passages in the book--as well as the equivalent scenes in the 1995 production--make for masterful comic moments.  In this film, it's BING (Collins arrives) BANG (he proposes to Elizabeth, who rejects him completely) and BOOM (he marries Charlotte).  The acting is fine--especially Tom Hollander, who has some fine comic moments as Collins.  But the timing is way off.I will give director Joe Wright and his collaborators credit for coming up with a top flight ensemble cast overall.  There has been considerable attention payed to the casting of Keira Knightley, who is somewhat closer in age to her character than previous Elizabeths had been, and there is something to be said for that kind of ""age appropriateness.""  All well and good.  She's a fine young actress.  But her dialogue--like so much else in the movie--is too rushed and therefore almost awkward.  Elizabeth should speak with a kind of regal self-confidence.  That she doesn't quite manage that may not be Knightley's fault.  It's hard to be a witty and spirited conversationalist when you're obliged to dash through your lines.Matthew McFadyen as the more taciturn Darcy has it somewhat easier.  Like most educated young men of his class and of his era--and like any proper Austen hero--he is supremely well-spoken when he chooses to speak. McFadyen is an appealing actor, and certainly not a bad Darcy (he will have his camp followers, just as Colin Firth has his), but just about all he has time for is a furrowed brow here, a wounded look there.Probably the only really bad casting is that of Judi Dench as the Queen of the Night--I mean, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  In British cinema, Dench is, of course, an institution.  Here unfortunately, she's more of a mental institution.  Her moments onscreen are almost painful to watch.  Someone on this site (perhaps the Amazon critic?) has kindly described her performanceas ""full throttle.""  That's polite for ""overkill.""Well, she does liven things up a bit.  But what we really need and what we really expect from any production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a certain esprit,  a sense of narrative driven by intelligent, incisive dialogue.  That's where the subtle social satire comes in.  Do away with that and you have a romantic 19th Century love story.  Not bad, but not all it could be.  And not really what it's supposed to be either.PS--I notice I received a number of ""non-helpful"" votes within less than 24 hours of posting this qualified (not actually NEGATIVE) review.  Well, people are certainly entitled to their opinions (just as I am entitled to mine).  However, I do wish readers of these reviews would learn to make the distinction between ""non-helpful"" and  ""I disagree with this.""  If a negative (or mixed) review gets you to THINK about why you liked the work in question, then, kids, it is HELPFUL.  You just happen to disagree with it.  I sometimes get the impression that some readers out there want nothing more than to see their own biases confirmed.

Knightley is perfect in the part, and the rest are well placed as well, though the girls should've looked a little different in age to be precise. The only problem, once you know the book and Austin's life/material is that the director, which did such an excellent job in the first half, only did an average job in the second. That mirror scene failed, and should have been cut in the editting room if not later before release. The feel of the book was changed too much in the second half from the man's sister to the lack of walking scenes, so that the sense of history is lost in an attempt to 'modernize' the storyline, forgetting that the essence can be lost in the same process.All that said, I feel it is the best version I've seen. Others have had a better sense of historical accuracy but the female leads just weren't 'right' for the part in my opinion. Knightley seemed to be made up as Austin at times and the feel of the characters seemed more true, even if so many changes were made by the end. She is the only actress that 'was' the character in all the version's I've seen, the others either didn't have the look or the feel or age to play the part... again, in my opinion, as today's 'taste' has changed over the past few decades. I just wish the second half of the script could've been rewritten and reshot, a couple of great 'walking' scenes would have made better adaptations to film drama/comedy than what the director/writer choose for whatever reason they had at the time, but again, if I had to point to one, I'd take this shortened version over the other longer ones, that seemed so dull by comparison, some of which is a statement of British tv production values or lack of, at the time.

I thought Macfadyen rather ugly! I'm sorry, and I think he's very nice-looking in real life. But as Mr. Darcy... ugh! Also, he didn't make a convincing ""insufferable"" Mr. Darcy. Darcy is supposed to be rather rude, cold, and arrogant. Macfadyen simply looked either bored or sleepy.Mr. Collins: Oh, what a travesty! He's hardly even in the movie, and he didn't really seem to care a twopence about Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  This Mr. Collins was incredibly dull, his only advantage being his shortness.Mr. Bennet: Donald Sutherland lacks Mr. Bennet's dry wit and sarcasm, much too quiet and beaten down to be interesting. Also, it looked like he hardly ever shaved. With his long hair and scruffy chin, I kept thinking he looked like a cross between Benjamin Franklin and a pirate.Dialogue: Choppy, rushed, and SO watered down from Austen's original. They talked so fast that it was like they were afraid of running out of time and had to spit out every line as fast as they could.Costuming: Although a bit more attractive to our 21st century eyes than that of A&E;, it does not feel as authentic. Miss Bingley's dress in particular is ridiculous, having no sleeves and only very thin straps.Music: The one area in which this movie shines, although the music is not as authentic to the time period as that in A&E.;I had fairly low expectations when I started this movie, but I really tried to like it. Unfortunately, I found the events rushed and chopped, the characters cast quite poorly, and the over-all movie pretty lame. I was more bored in two hours than I've ever been in the five hour-long version. If you're looking for a good one, I would recommend the 1995 A&E; TV serial.",1,Why did they even bother?,1290470400,"11 23, 2010",2010,2590,"['am', 'completely', 'prejudiced', 'LOVE', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'did', 'least', 'hope', 'find', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'big', 'disappointment.Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Played', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'lacked', 'spirit', 'When', 'talking', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'ball', 'supposed', 'be', 'enjoying', 'clever', 'witty', 'word', 'play', 'just', 'talks', 'anyone', 'else', 'would', 'why', 'seem', 'attracted', 'Darcy', 'even', 'supposed', 'find', 'insufferable', 'many', 'reviewers', 'said', 'felt', 'could', 'relate', 'Knightly', 'better', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'connection', 'showed', 'very', 'little', 'emotion', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'ranting', 'angrily', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'performance', 'entrancing.Mr', 'Darcy', 'Someone', 'told', 'thought', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'cuter', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'expectations', 'too', 'high', 'thought', 'Macfadyen', 'rather', 'ugly', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'think', 'very', 'nice-looking', 'real', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'ugh', 'Also', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'convincing', 'insufferable', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Darcy', 'supposed', 'be', 'rather', 'rude', 'cold', 'arrogant', 'Macfadyen', 'simply', 'looked', 'bored', 'sleepy.Mr', 'Collins', 'Oh', 'what', 'travesty', 'hardly', 'even', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'care', 'twopence', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourgh', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'was', 'incredibly', 'dull', 'only', 'advantage', 'being', 'shortness.Mr', 'Bennet', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'dry', 'wit', 'sarcasm', 'much', 'too', 'quiet', 'beaten', 'down', 'be', 'interesting', 'Also', 'looked', 'hardly', 'ever', 'shaved', 'long', 'hair', 'scruffy', 'chin', 'kept', 'thinking', 'looked', 'cross', 'Benjamin', 'Franklin', 'pirate.Dialogue', 'Choppy', 'rushed', 'SO', 'watered', 'down', 'Austen', 'original', 'talked', 'so', 'fast', 'was', 'were', 'afraid', 'running', 'time', 'had', 'spit', 'out', 'line', 'fast', 'could.Costuming', 'bit', 'more', 'attractive', '21st', 'century', 'eyes', 'A', 'E', 'not', 'feel', 'authentic', 'Miss', 'Bingley', 'dress', 'particular', 'ridiculous', 'having', 'sleeves', 'only', 'very', 'thin', 'straps.Music', 'one', 'area', 'movie', 'music', 'not', 'as', 'authentic', 'time', 'period', 'A', 'E', 'had', 'fairly', 'low', 'expectations', 'when', 'started', 'movie', 'really', 'tried', 'like', 'Unfortunately', 'found', 'events', 'rushed', 'chopped', 'characters', 'cast', 'quite', 'poorly', 'over-all', 'movie', 'pretty', 'lame', 'was', 'more', 'bored', 'two', 'hours', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'five', 'hour-long', 'version', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'one', 'would', 'recommend', '1995', 'A', 'E', 'TV', 'serial']",N/A

640695,A24I3BMB9JZC7O,B00005JOHI,"Ingrid Heyn ""No man is an Iland, intire of it...","[35, 43]","There is no denying that turning a book as rich in characterisation and plot as ""Pride and Prejudice"" into a film is a dicey proposition. It's no potboiler with forgettable dialogue. Its characters are not two-dimensional. The story threads interweave and there is delicious wit and rather wicked social commentary from the pen of Jane Austen. How can a film adaptation hope to capture all of that?Of course, it cannot.But need a film adaptation transgress as heinously and thoroughly as this one does against the intentions of the author?There were some inexplicable blunders that don't make sense at all: Darcy actually CAME INTO ELIZABETH BENNET'S BEDROOM to give her the letter he wrote (inexcusable blunder - this is simply inconceivable); the Bennet dining room had servants serving the food in far too small a room (English country houses do not have dining rooms of such miniature dimensions, and certainly a normal meal rather than a grand occasion for a family of the straitened circumstances the film attempts to portray would not include servants standing at the ready to serve. It seems as though the director has melded the serving practises of larger country houses with the idea of a poorer yet still genteel family, but that is entirely historically inaccurate); Darcy was wandering about with his shirt undone and no cravat (as sexy-looking as that is, it's so inauthentic as to constitute an unforgivable faux pas); the ball held by Bingley had far too many people to constitute a country ball held to get to know his neighbours (again, it seems the director is going by vaguely and inaccurately held ideas of English country habits - could some real research not have been done?); the entire embarrassing and ridiculous scene with Elizabeth Bennet lasciviously viewing and caressing naked statues could only strike a 20th or 21st century American audience as appropriate; and Darcy proposing in the rain... (as anachronistic as a watch on the wrist of Michelangel's David); and an utterly bewildering moment occurs when Lady Catherine de Bourgh arrives at the Bennet's house in the middle of the night. Unless she came with urgent news, she would have been neither heard nor admitted at such an hour, nor would a gentleman have dreamed of appearing in front of a lady in his nightclothes. Those are only some of the ill-conceived and inappropriate moments.Let us pass over the strange family dynamics - clearly neither the director nor the actors bothered to read the novel in order to discover the complex relationships involved. For one thing, Mr and Mrs Bennet's marital relationship was clearly written by Jane Austen to be the worst mismatch in history; Mr Bennet is intended to be so disgusted and bored by most of his family (wife and daughters, except for Elizabeth and Jane) that he can find refuge only in perceiving them as amusing, and hiding in his study to avoid having to deal with them.Let us pass then to the casting. Keira Knightley is a lovely-looking young actress, but the character of Elizabeth Bennet is beyond her. She does not have the complexity to understand such a character, and her acting skills are not at present sufficient to convey the depth of such a richly drawn character. However, for the purpose of this film, the characters are completely altered anyway. In terms, then, of this film, within its confines (and not in respect of Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet), Ms Knightley was perfectly adequate, although she looked odd at times. Partly this is because her thinness was highlighted rather than flattered, and partly it's because her hair was so very strangely arranged. I could not understand the ""washerwoman"" hairdo, I confess - it is historically inappropriate for the period. If the purpose was to make Elizabeth Bennet look less beautiful than Jane Bennet, a very strange idea has occurred. Elizabeth is certainly not plain in the novel. She has a loveliness that is characterised more by her liveliness than feature-by-feature, but she is considered by all who know her to be one of the prettiest girls in the county. Jane is considered by the regularity of her features to be the most beautiful, but the whole Bennet family is known for their beauty (save for Mary). How has this been translated to mean that Elizabeth is not lovely-looking? Why the insistence in this film on downplaying Keira Knightley's looks? Simply because Mr Darcy does not instantly find Elizabeth Bennet beautiful...? And because Miss Caroline Bingley and her sister will not do justice to her looks? The difference between Elizabeth and Jane is one of kind, not of quantity. Both the director and some of the viewers seem not to have realised that.The Darcy looked beautiful, and it's not really the actor's fault that he was not conveying Jane Austen's Darcy. Again, really I blame the scriptwriter who did such an appalling hatchet job, and the director who seems to have thought of this film in terms of making the cinematography look beautiful but eschewed any care with regard to historical detail or the requirements of the story itself.The dialogue flip-flops from modern ""I'm writing an historical novel"" style to authentic Jane Austen - and the difference between the two styles is embarrassing. Unless a scriptwriter is prepared to enmesh him/herself into the writing style of the period, complete with an understanding of the grammar of the English language as spoken at the time, and specifically the style employed by Jane Austen, such an obvious clash is bound to occur. And furthermore, a modern idea of dialogue can only create further flaws in the style of the dialogue. It simply doesn't work unless the scriptwriter is prepared to let go of a 21st century idea of how the characters OUGHT to be. If he/she isn't prepared to do that, the scriptwriter had better stick to modern dramas.What a pity that the scriptwriter felt it necessary to make Darcy ""misunderstood"" rather than truly ""proud"". This reduces the title of the book (and thus the title of the film) to meaningless drivel. In the novel, Darcy really WAS a proud man - he acknowledges it, and through his love for Elizabeth and the travails in their relationship, he found within himself a more proper understanding of how he could maintain his sense of self yet become more approachable. Elizabeth, too, acknowleged in the novel that her prejudices led her astray, and she, through knowing Darcy and through the troubles of her own family, comes to learn herself more thoroughly. ""Until this moment I never knew myself"", she says - but she does not say it in the film. Indeed, she could not - for in the film, she too is just ""misunderstood"". The characters do not grow and develop in this film - because, like a Mills & Boon romance novel, they don't need to. The characters are two-dimensional - but most viewers don't seem to notice that.To compare this film to the splendid 6-part adaptation with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth is to compare a somewhat battered meringue with a superb full-sized gateau. The BBC series had everything right; this film sadly does not.I suppose the main flaw of this film was its obviousness. Moments such as ""sexy open-shirted man strides through the mist, his cloak flapping in the wind behind him"" abound. Oh dear. Very, very Mills-and-Boonish. The lack of subtlety is everywhere... and the same holds true for the character dynamics. Instead of the subtle 18th century character interplay, the audience is served with lashings of modernised ideas of love sans any of the biting social judgements that add spice to Jane Austen's excellent writing.By the end of this film (indeed, fifteen minutes into the film), I no longer cared whether Darcy and Elizabeth ever married. I could not consider them real. They had no claim upon my sympathy. What a contrast to my emotional involvement in the BBC series!I recommend this only for viewers who enjoy soap operas, or for people who don't care about historical accuracy or subtle performances. Oh, and it may also please those who find Jane Austen's actual novel too difficult to read.",2,The Harlequin Mills & Boon version of Pride And Prejudice,1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,8091,"['denying',

In the protracted pre-dawn of the audio-visual age that we call the nineteenth century, literature, as in our day, could be conceived as a means of making people think, but never could it guarantee where thoughts might wander.  The whole idea was to set thoughts in motion, to stir the imagination into creating self-styled images that reflected the author's words as readers experienced them.  A do-it-yourself motion picture.I think that Jane Austen would find our reflections every bit as entertaining as her own.  As ever, the character of human nature is timeless, much as we delightin exploring the nature of her characters, and have done for generations, beyond anything that she could have anticipated.I am impressed with this film at all levels.  The cinematography is outstanding, and beautifully understated, as is the acting.  Historically, it is as true to the period as anything I've seen.  It's also a product of its own time, and the pace runs accordingly.  Parts of the original book are suggested more than played outon screen.

640701,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B00005JOHI,James Hiller,"[29, 37]","Is it possible for a film to get better and better with repeated viewings? I originially caught Pride and Prejudice in the theaters when released, and was surprisingly delighted at the adaptation presented before me. Then, I promptly forgot it with the Caoptes and Brokeback Mountains of the world. Upon it's release on DVD, I absolutely fell in love with this movie, and again and again, and now regard it as a mere masterpiece; a cinematic feast.I'm not an Austen purest. In fact, I shudder to admit on Amazon.com that I have not even read her. So any comparison of the book to the movie would be lost on me. I also have not witnessed the BBC comprehensive version of Pride, to which many compare this movie. So the disruptive ending of the movie, which sometimes seems to upset the Austen purests, and the wonderful performance of Colin Firth, which dominates the BBC version, are unknown to me. I watch this with virgin eyes.And of course, I delight in what I see. A story of a young woman, one of four girls, destined in early 1800's England to marry, but with strong will and mind of her own. She bristles against the bristle-y Mr. Darcy, hard edged, unsocial (much like me, minus the money), and like flint and steel, tremendously spark and start a fire which burns through the film, brightly, intensely, passionately. The moments of confrontation, and lack thereof, between Elizabeth and Darcy are juicy, palpable, and true, and thus drive this plot honestly.The performances astound. I've caught all of the leading actress roles this year, and I must say, Kiera Knightly's performance ranks as superior. She is the film; simply put. Should another actress play Elizabeth, the film would have lost its soulforce. By all rights, she should have marched up to the stage to claim her reward (possibly only surpassed by the comparable Felicity Huffman's role in Transamerica). In turn, Matthew Macfadyen's harsh Mr. Darcy melts before our eyes and on the screen before Elizabeth, and the glacial melt is amazing. Where was his nomination? Supporting actors Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn were born to play Elizabeth's honest, supportive parents. And Tom Hollander as the bumbling, ill-fated suitor Mr. Collins almost steals the movie with his comic pathos. Fine performances from all.Adding to this mix, Joe Wright's amazing, amazing, amazing direction. Most of the film's enjoyment comes from his camera placement and work. Just watch the scene at the second party, where the camera moves throughout the party, and manages to tell several parts of the story seemlessly at once. Wright tells on the commentary how it took hours to set up the shot; the results impress and delight. He shaped this movie, which could have been another bland period piece, into something rich, delightful, multi-layered, and dare I say.... modern?Pride and Prejudice is a film that in many years, people will be popping into their video players of the future; to study fine filmmaking, to learn from solid performances, to watch young love, and to enjoy the exploits of Elizabeth and Darcy, their machinations of love, and the persistance of desire.Bravo!",5,Better and Better,1142640000,"03 18, 2006",2006,3145,"['possible', 'film', 'get', 'better', 'better', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'originially', 'caught', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'theaters', 'when', 'released', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'delighted', 'adaptation', 'presented', 'Then', 'promptly', 'forgot', 'Caoptes', 'Brokeback', 'Mountains', 'world', 'release', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'fell', 'love', 'movie', 'again', 'again', 'now', 'regard', 'mere', 'masterpiece', 'cinematic', 'feast.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'Austen', 'purest', 'fact', 'shudder', 'admit', 'Amazon.com', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'read', 'comparison', 'book', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'lost', 'also', 'have', 'not', 'witnessed', 'BBC', 'comprehensive', 'version', 'Pride', 'many', 'compare', 'movie', 'disruptive', 'ending', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'upset', 'Austen', 'purests', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'BBC', 'version', 'are', 'unknown', 'watch', 'virgin', 'eyes.And', 'course', 'delight', 'what', 'see', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'one', 'four', 'girls', 'destined', 'early', '1800', 'England', 'marry', 'strong', 'will', 'mind', 'own', 'bristle-y', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'hard', 'edged', 'unsocial', 'much', 'money', 'flint', 'steel', 'tremendously', 'spark', 'start', 'fire', 'film', 'brightly', 'intensely', 'passionately', 'moments', 'confrontation', 'lack', 'thereof', 'Elizabeth', 'Darcy', 'are', 'juicy', 'palpable', 'true', 'thus', 'drive', 'plot', 'honestly.The', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'caught', 'leading', 'actress', 'roles', 'year', 'must', 'say', 'Kiera', 'Knightly', 'performance', 'ranks', 'superior', 'film', 'simply', 'put', 'Should', 'actress', 'play', 'Elizabeth', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'lost', 'soulforce', 'rights', 'should', 'have', 'marched', 'up', 'stage', 'claim', 'reward', 'possibly', 'only', 'surpassed', 'comparable', 'Felicity', 'Huffman', 'role', 'Transamerica', 'turn', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'harsh', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'melts', 'eyes', 'screen', 'Elizabeth', 'glacial', 'melt', 'amazing', 'Where', 'was', 'nomination', 'Supporting', 'actors', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'were', 'born', 'play', 'Elizabeth', 'honest', 'supportive', 'parents', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'bumbling', 'ill-fated', 'suitor', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'almost', 'movie', 'comic', 'pathos', 'Fine', 'performances', 'all.Adding', 'mix', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'direction', 'Most', 'film', 'enjoyment', 'camera', 'placement', 'work', 'Just', 'watch', 'scene', 'second', 'party', 'where', 'camera', 'party', 'tell', 'several', 'parts', 'story', 'seemlessly', 'once', 'Wright', 'commentary', 'how', 'took', 'hours', 'set', 'up', 'shot', 'results', 'impress', 'delight', 'shaped', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bland', 'period', 'piece', 'something', 'rich', 'delightful', 'multi-layered', 'dare', 'say', 'modern', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'film', 'many', 'years', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'popping', 'video', 'players', 'future', 'study', 'fine', 'filmmaking', 'learn', 'solid', 'performances', 'watch', 'young', 'love', 'enjoy', 'exploits', 'Elizabeth', 'Darcy', 'machinations', 'love', 'persistance', 'desire.Bravo']",N/A
640702,A17JVI15BRY90P,B00005JOHI,James T. Wheeler,"[16, 21]","1. This movie is much better than my wife and I expected.  To be sure, there are big departures from Jane Austen's book and the tale seems tailored to a modern audience.  Nevertheless, we're giving this production five stars, because of its overall impact and flow.  The acting and location shots are first-rate and key scenes are so beautifully done.  We particularly liked the scene near the end where Elizabeth entreats her father so she might marry Mr. Darcy.  She reveals how Darcy is the one who bailed out the Bennett family from Mr. Wickham's debts and also arranged for sister Lydia's marriage. This ending seems more convincing than other versions we've seen because it registers with Mr. Bennett that Darcy is the one who saved the family.  If you look it up, the bail-out revelation is in the book.2. Viewers may want to turn on English subtitles in places so as to get all the dialogue.  This is a British production making it hard for we Americans to follow at times.  An idea raised by another reviewer is also a good one, namely, to turn on the director's commentary when you have time to re-view the movie.  A lot of things come out you would not know otherwise, making this a deeper film than what you first saw.  Not all the director's comments are profound but when he tells you he devoted 2 years of his life to the film (morning, noon, and night) you need to pay attention.  Also, we're told why Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle are given a tour of sculptures at Pemberley rather than seeing portraits of the Darcy family.  Sure, the scene departs from the book, as so many other things do, but it's awfully well done.3. This movie runs only 2 hours, so its character development pales in comparison with miniseries that were done by the BBC in 1979 and by A&E; in 1995.  On DVD, these productions run 4 and 5 hours, respectively.  To really understand the story line most viewers should see one or both of these and even read the book.  Key characters like Wickham and Mr. & Mrs. Collins barely have cameo roles in the 2005 movie which is a pity.  Also, time constraints may have precluded showing more on the special relationship between Mr. Bennett and his second daughter, Elizabeth, who may really be his alter ego.4. In other respects, it's apparent that the producer and director wanted to stage this movie a lot differently than previous versions.  The Bennett family is seen living a very rustic life with pigs, geese, and dogs underfoot.  This is a major departure from life discussed in the book and depicted in other film and TV versions.  This movie is set in the year, 1797, not 1813, as previously understood.  In another departure, the opening ballroom scene is far more informal and earthy than what we've seen before. But it has an infectious energy that prepares you for the rest of the show.  Yes, this version is going to be different from other ones!5. For most of the movie, Elizabeth runs around in very casual attire with her hair wild and unkempt.  All the while she states her opinions freely and is not bashful about offending others, including her poor mother.  In many ways, Lizzy seems like a wild animal that may appeal to Darcy's basic instincts. This is another big departure from the book and from past productions where the eldest Bennett girls are seen as well-dressed and presentable, desperate as they are to find good husbands.  The ""car wreck"" scene where Elizabeth rejects Darcy and his first marriage proposal may be the most powerful moment in the movie.  Darcy, despite his imposing size and presence, appears lucky Elizabeth didn't have a club nearby when she rejected him.  What a contrast to the second proposal where Darcy stammers out his love for her and Elizabeth accepts him while gently taking his hand.  Brilliantly done!6. Music has been an important element in past productions of Pride and Prejudice and it is here, as well.  The Baroque-era music played at the balls is our favorite kind.  Also, the haunting piano theme heard throughout the show is extremely well done and played.  Bravo!7. Although the casting of Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett may have raised some eyebrows we thought he did quite well, especially at the end where he talks to Elizabeth about Darcy's second proposal.  Keira Knightley is marvelous as the untamed Elizabeth, Mr. Bennett's favorite daughter.  Matthew MacFadyen is a revelation as Darcy.  In truth, Matthew looks like such a physical specimen he might have playing linebacker for the Green Bay Packers.  What's just as amazing is that when he speaks he sounds like an educated, British gentleman.  Actors portraying Mrs. Bennett, Jane Bennett, Mr. & Mrs. Collins, Lady Catherine DeBourgh, Mr. & Miss Bingley, and the other Bennett sisters were fine, too.  Mr. Bingley did seem a bit foppish at times, but in contrast to MacFadyen's Darcy, it's not surprising.8. At the end, Elizabeth seems to blame herself completely for misjudging Darcy.  He comes off then as pride-free and irresistible.  Some might feel this is taking one too many liberties with Jane Austen's message.  Actually, Darcy has been changed and humbled by Elizabeth's rejection of his first proposal.  It takes several months for a transformation to be completed and for Darcy to do heroic deeds.  He then becomes acceptable to her and us.  The movie's producer and director may have been aware of this fact but with only 2 hours to work with simply couldn't show it.  Or, maybe they just wanted to stress that rich people have their problems, too?9. Comparisons to the other versions of Pride and Prejudice are difficult.  For us, the wit and elegance of the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version from 1995, may never be surpassed.  Also, the 1979 miniseries with Elizabeth Garvie, David Rintoul, and Judy Parfitt has special moments.  The 1940 version with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier deserves attention as well, even though it takes even more liberties with Jane Austen's story than the others.  In style and substance, the 2005 version is quite different from earlier ones but it is effective and entertaining.  Our sense is to get and study them all.  The timeless story and characters make for a masterpiece in English literature and a study of human nature.  If nothing else, the happy ending of the 2005 version is classic.10. Special features on the 2005, DVD include interviews with the producer, the director, and the main characters.  There is some repetition, but their comments offer more insights into why this story is so appealing. Too bad other productions haven't offered interviews of the leading stars in this way.  Maybe we'll see them some day in a super-gold, Nth anniversary, collectors' edition?",5,"Not the 1995 version, but still very well done",1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,6707,"['1', 'movie', 'much',

It was so good and followed the book so well that I wondered what was the purpose of remaking this story and in such an inferior way. I do not believe that I am being nitpicking when I say that at the time of the story, women would never have been seen with such messy hair and clothing.  Even the poorer class ones (which the Bennets most certainly were NOT) would never have lived and dressed the way they are depicted in this ridiculous film.  Pigs in the yard and such dirty surroundings!  Really!  It looked more like Tobacco Road than the home of British gentry!  The characters also were badly interpreted especially Mr. Bingley who was a real wuss and one wonders what did Jane see in him besides his money.  Did screen writers or director even crack the book?

640704,A96AUNSF6GESO,B00005JOHI,Janeite,"[4, 5]","Okay, I'm a total Janeite who adores Austen and all her work. I probably re-read each of her novels at least once a year, and I'm a high school English teacher. So I find the 1995 BBC mini-series to be the Holy Grail of Austen movies. But this one has its charms. I am not a big Keira Knightley fan, and I found her Lizzy to be less spunky and more moody than in the novel. (The director keeps showing Lizzy alone, staring into space. I suppose that should make us think she's deep.She's much more cheerful and sociable in the book.) Also the director went for a ""grubby"" look in this movie. Everybody has greasy hair and appears to need a shower. I guess he figures nobody bathed much in those days. The story is a bare bones version of the book that hits the high points quickly, but the movie is clearly more interested in being beautiful and poetic, and there it succeeds. The piano music in this film is lyrical and moving, and the movie has lots of interesting visual images. The director does a nifty thing with the characters' hands that I really liked. And this Darcy (while no Colin Firth) is not too shabby. Matthew Macfadyen seems to be portraying a ""kinder, gentler"" Darcy who seems more shy that gruff, but he's such a handsome guy and has such a gorgeous, deep voice, that I enjoyed looking at him and listening to him. So my overall impression is that I liked it for what it was, a quicker more stylized version of a wonderful story. As a footnote, I'll add that my students fall into two camps when I show them this movie: girls who fall in love with Darcy and adore the film, and kids of both genders who say they hated it because the story moved so fast they couldn't tell what was happening.",4,Lovely but not that true to the novel,1233619200,"02 3, 2009",2009,1711,"['Okay', ""'m"", 'total', 'Janeite', 'who', 'Austen', 'work', 'probably', 're-read', 'novels', 'least', 'once', 'year', ""'m"", 'high', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'find', '1995', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'be', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Austen', 'movies', 'one', 'charms', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'fan', 'found', 'Lizzy', 'be', 'less', 'spunky', 'more', 'moody', 'novel', 'director', 'showing', 'Lizzy', 'alone', 'staring', 'space', 'suppose', 'should', 'make', 'think', 'deep.She', 'much', 'more', 'cheerful', 'sociable', 'book', 'Also', 'director', 'went', 'grubby', 'look', 'movie', 'Everybody', 'greasy', 'hair', 'need', 'shower', 'guess', 'nobody', 'bathed', 'much', 'days', 'story', 'bare', 'bones', 'version', 'book', 'high', 'points', 'quickly', 'movie', 'clearly', 'more', 'interested', 'being', 'beautiful', 'poetic', 'piano', 'music', 'film', 'lyrical', 'moving', 'movie', 'lots', 'interesting', 'visual', 'images', 'director', 'nifty', 'thing', 'characters', 'hands', 'really', 'liked', 'Darcy', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'not', 'too', 'shabby', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'be', 'portraying', 'kinder', 'gentler', 'Darcy', 'who', 'more', 'shy', 'gruff', 'such', 'handsome', 'guy', 'such', 'gorgeous', 'deep', 'voice', 'enjoyed', 'looking', 'listening', 'overall', 'impression', 'liked', 'what', 'was', 'quicker', 'more', 'stylized', 'version', 'wonderful', 'story', 'footnote', ""'ll"", 'add', 'students', 'fall', 'two', 'camps', 'when', 'show', 'movie', 'girls', 'who', 'fall', 'love', 'Darcy', 'adore', 'film', 'kids', 'genders', 'who', 'say', 'hated', 'story', 'moved', 'so', 'fast', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'happening']",N/A

Her quirks and mannerism's all seem to scream ""Look at me! Look at me!"" in almost a Lydia like fashion, pardon the pun. The Darcy in this one was good, loved his eyes, but I just couldn't get past Knightley. There were redeeming qualities about this though. Donald Sutherland as her father was excellent and I especially enjoyed the final scene between he and his daughter when he's asking her if she really likes Darcy. He tears up and it's entirely believable. I did not like the scene at the end when Darcy and Lizzie finally declare their love for each other. Instead of answering, in this version, Knightly takes his hand and kisses it. I'm very much convinced, after reading several Jane Austen's and books during this era, that this would not have happened. There is just too much propriety here during this age for that.

So, after hearing the rave reviews, we decided to throw caution to the wind and watch it, after swearing never, not once, to compare between the two.All in all, it wasn't a bad movie. The main problem lies in the confusing storyline which simply cannot be covered in such a short time. If I hadn't such an intimate knowledge of P&P; before the movie, I would have been quite lost. This affects character developement and relationships. There are moments of quiet and pretty music but very little interaction between Elizabeth and Darcy.The feel of old-England society was lost, which leads to a lot of confusion. Why is it so terrible that Darcy won't dance with Elizabeth? Why are her sisters such an embarrasment when the parties they are in are as raucus as themselves? Being familiar with the book, I already knew, but the impact of the embarassing and moving moments were lost because the society that made them embarassing and moving were gone. Also, Elizabeth going out into the rain to get herself a towel off the line? *shakes head* The Bennets are not poor; they happen to be quite well-to-do, the only thing they don't have is dowries for the girls. You can have a huge income and not any money saved up. And admiring nude statues in Darcy's home? Uhh.. that's not right.The society portrayed in this movie was not the stuffy, prissy life of the upper-middle class, but more suited to the lower. Perhaps they meant to liven it up a bit by showing us the nitty-gritty side to life, but instead they spoiled the feeling of the whole society. Elizabeth and Jane giggling in bed? I don't know.. that's just not.. English.Keira Knightly is not a bad Elizabeth Bennet. She did justice to the role. Darcy talked to fast and was more quiet and laid back than arrogant and imposing. Also, he wasn't good-looking at all. Part of his personna is his hot animal attraction! Wickham was not only very likeable but gorgeous! That's not right! Darcy should be more cute! (Ok, enough juvenile complaints) Mr.Collins was.. not stupid. He was almost.. conniving. And handsome, too, if short. I really couldn't understand why Elizabeth could object so strongly to marry him especially considering her family's condition. It seemed.. selfish of her. Again, this is only looking at the movie as though I had never read the book before.THe movie was pretty, with beautiful music and nice acting. It had its good parts and carried the essence of the story pretty well. However, it left much to be desired and the characters weren't Jane Austen's own. I would have to recommend the BBC version.. the book there is played to perfection.

640708,A2JSQCBXKZNNJO,B00005JOHI,Jason Baker,"[10, 18]","I still consider the 1995 miniseries to be THE definitive version of Pride & Prejudice.Still, this new version does have things about it I prefer to any other version. Donald Sutherland in this version I find to be the best Mr. Bennet of all versions.No matter what version you watch, you hear Mrs. Bennet repeatedly comment on how much prettier Jane is than Lizzy. In the '95 version Lizzy is 10 times prettier than Jane and therefore Mrs. Bennet's comments just make you scratch your head and say ""what!?"". The Jane in the new version is such a beauty that you can accept these comments even though you may not agree with them. The Jane in this version is also more fitting in age. The Jane in the '95 version seems to old for the part, even though Susannah Harker acted the part with perfection.I like the new Wickham a bit better too since in the new one he is much more handsome. Someone could indeed picture Lizzy choosing him over Darcy for looks alone and therefore could indeed be considered a threat. The Wickham in the '95 version isn't nearly as good-looking as Mr. Darcy and therefore less of a threat.As far as Mr. Bingley goes, I loved both the new and old '95 versions of him. Unlike most people I like the new Mr. Bingley better. He is more shy and timid in the new version and this to me makes him more endearingAs far as comparing the 2 Lizzies, I think that Keira Knightley is every bit as a talented actress as Jennifer Ehle is in the '95 version. With that said every now and then an actor or actress comes along who was born to play a part. As much as Keanu Reeves isn't the best actor out there , he was born to play the part of Neo in The Matrix. Nobody could have done it better. I feel the same way about Jennifer Ehle in the mini series. While Miss Knightley is just as talented and did a great job in the remake, Jennifer Ehle was simply born for this part and truly embodies Lizzy. I don't think anyone could have done a better job than her.The same goes for Colin Firth as Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. While Matthew Macfadyen did a WONDERFUL job in the remake, Colin Firth was simply born the part. He IS Darcy.All-in-all as a whole there is no version that can compare to the '95 mini series, which is truly a masterpiece. Still, the new version is well worth buying and offers a refreshing take on this story. I would even go as far as saying that the new version is my favorite movie of the year !I rate the '95 version 10 stars out of 10 , and this new version 9 stars out of 10.

And although the film has an 18th c. setting feel - a bit of the country raunch of Tom Jones - it is not the setting Austen wrote. Her characters did not wallow in pig slop.  Most of her wit is swamped by misty morning ramblings of the young stars, caught in glowing close-ups - time better spent on the plot and dialogue.  Classic comic characters are given short shrift and played with far too much seriousness or sympathy.  The all important sub-plot, which explains the sisters dilemma, flashes by so fast that many may miss its significance, particularly in light of today's mores. But then adequate development might detract from the time needed for all those misty close-ups.  Knightley is attractive but this is NOT her Academy Award star turn - or rather, shouldn't have been.  If Austen doesn't matter to you, you'll enjoy the film.  If Austen does, stick with the BBC mini-series.",3,Pretty Is As Pretty Does,1158019200,"09 12, 2006",2006,1263,"['very', 'attractive', 'film', 'Attractive', 'stars', 'attractive', 'sets', 'attractive', 'story', 'period', 'romance', 'fine', 'entertaining', 'film', 'not', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fact', 'were', ""n't"", 'already', 'well', 'versed', 'plot', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'get', 'film', 'Austen', 'wrote', '18th', 'century', 'sensibility', 'not', 'Romantic', 'Age', 'one', 'film', '18th', 'c.', 'setting', 'feel', 'bit', 'country', 'raunch', 'Tom', 'Jones', 'not', 'setting', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'wallow', 'pig', 'slop', 'Most', 'wit', 'swamped', 'misty', 'morning', 'ramblings', 'young', 'stars', 'caught', 'glowing', 'close-ups', 'time', 'better', 'spent', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'Classic', 'comic', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'played', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'seriousness', 'sympathy', 'important', 'sub-plot', 'sisters', 'dilemma', 'flashes', 'fast', 'many', 'may', 'miss', 'significance', 'particularly', 'light', 'today', 'mores', 'then', 'adequate', 'development', 'might', 'detract', 'time', 'needed', 'misty', 'close-ups', 'Knightley', 'attractive', 'NOT', 'Academy', 'Award', 'star', 'turn', 'rather', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'Austen', ""n't"", 'matter', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'Austen', 'stick', 'BBC', 'mini-series']",N/A

Obviously, this is a shorter movie and necessarily cannot follow the book as closely, which I don't necessarily have a problem with. The real issue that I have with this movie is the incorrect portrayal of the characters, particularly that of Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Darcy looks like scruffy slob in much of the movie, which is ridiculous. The worst though is Mr. Bingley. His character is portrayed as stupid throughout the whole movie. While Mr. Bingley is certainly a bit goofy in the book, he is anything but stupid. Here though, the directors or whoever else have made him seem like a bumbling idiot. This is such a shallow interpretation of his character, as if he serves no other purpose in the story besides comedic value, which is preposterous.Realistically though, this movie was created purely for entertainment and they did do that.

The film skimps on the relationship between Elizabeth and her father, and flattens the differences between the sisters until they are nearly indistinguishable. Mister Collins, the fusty pastor, is only marginally dull; fiendish Mr. Wickham seems incapable of guile; Lydia Bennet insufficiently silly. The movie gives us little background to appreciate the country-vs-city issues, such as why Darcy and Miss Bingley considered walking so bizarre a mode of transport. And not for a moment did I consider Keira Knightley as someone who could be taken as plain-looking.The sets are quite splendid, however. Even the Bennet's ""poor"" country manor, for all its faded and peeling glory, is rendered with great detail. The sountrack however, was so loud and lush and hardworking that it bordered on clich&eacute; -- when it wasn't actually masking important dialog. So much of the film is hurried, with machine-gun dialog that I could not understand. And compensatory touches -- like providing the characters with different outfits or outsized personalities -- were ignored for some reason, perhaps to focus more on the main characters. If so, this was a huge mistake. The charm of P&P; is the interplay between the book's many characters and the norms that governed them. To streamline the characters and plot is to take away the story's soul.And no amount of loud music can make up for that.I highly recommend the 1995 miniseries, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.

It's especially encouraging, then, to see such a well-made, engaging translation to the big screen. It's no small feat, as for many Austenites (including my wife), the 1995 BBC-TV miniseries is the definitive one.While that version has six hours to gently unfold the romance of the quick-witted, independent Elizabeth Bennett (Keira Knightley) and the imperious, remote Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen), this new film only has two. It's a fine telescoping and shuffling of locales and events, nicely paced without feeling rushed. Both performers warm to each other in increments well-suited for the story's shape. It's believable, tender and touching.The casting choices are strong, but purists may find themselves longing for the BBC cast at times. Especially missed are Benjamin Whitrow's Mr. Bennett, and David Bamber's Mr. Collins. Mr. Whitrow's Bennett is a flinty delight, but Mr. Sutherland's final scene is so warm and emotional that it rescues his far softer interpretation. Tom Hollander's Mr. Collins suffers the most in comparison with his predecessor, whose hilarious take on the character bordered on the reptilian. Of course, Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy is in no danger of being eclipsed, but Mr. MacFadyen more than holds his own with a subtly rendered performance. Ms. Knightley defies the ""pretty girl"" casting with very strong acting as well, proving herself to be convincing in a period drama.This is a great stand-alone version of the story, drawing viewers in and engaging their hearts and minds.

Naturally, large parts were cut or reduced (such as Wickham and Collins' parts).  All that information cannot be faithfully reproduced in the short time span of a movie, as it can in a miniseries.  However, the filmakers hit all the right notes in what they chose to include and how well it was rendered.  The movie focused on Lizzie and Darcy, which is of course the heart of the novel.The acting was top notch, especially Keira Knightly.  She deserved the Best Actress nomination as she fully embodied Lizzie.  I disagree with the reviewer below about Darcy's ""deadpan eyes.""  They lit up like the sun in the closing of the movie when his love was embraced by Lizzie--he was a misunderstood person and Matthew Macfadyen conveyed that.  Additionally, it was nice that for once Darcy didn't have to be a ""pretty boy.""  Rugged good looks can be just as dashing!  Donald Sutherland was a delight as Mr. Bennett, conveying his love and exasperation for a family of women with charm and dry wit.  He is a superb actor, and you could see that he truly cared about these women (and the actresses who played them).While the movie was spectacular, the DVD leaves a lot to be desired.  There are four main featurettes, but there is a lot of repetition between them.  The viewer need only watch ""Behind the Scenes at the Ball.""  The interviews with the cast in it are repeated for ""HBO First Look"" and ""A Bennet Family Portrait.""  The small biopic on Jane Austen was nice, but not very informative--focusing mainly on her home and where she wrote her novel.  Why not a complete biography?  And where are the deleted scenes?  Filmakers are notorious for filming more than they could ever include.  During the commentary, the filmakers mention that the dancing scene at the Ball between Darcy and Lizzie was completely recut and edited.  Why not show the original cut vis a vis the theatrical cut?

I had never seen the TV miniseries, so I had nothing to compare it to, and I'd only read the book once, years before. So I came at it fresh, and based my opinion only on what was onscreen. I thought that Knightley was brilliant, and captured the lighthearted but also serious sides of Lizzy, and that MacFadyen was, I have to say it, a dreamboat. The filming - the amazing tracking shots, the way it moves in and out of window, the character actors playing all the other roles (Blethyn, Hollander and Dench are all FANTASTIC), the incredible scenery and lively earthy settings - I loved it all. I even set some of the music as my phone ringtone!  I watched it occasionally on TV over the years, and have always loved it.I just bought the DVD (June 2012, 7 years later) and watched it all the way through in one sitting.  In the last few years, I've read all of Austen several times through, and watched many film and TV adaptations, including the Firth/Ehle P&P;, and the 2009 Emma with Jonny Lee Miller and Romola Garai. Both of those, as 4 part mini-series, can be much truer to the plot and pace of the book than a 2 hour movie can - this P&P; has to speed through the plot, especially the second half.  And I notice it more now - we miss a lot of the character development and the true friendship that develops between Darcy and Elizabeth.I still love a lot about it - it is gorgeous, the acting is mostly wonderful. But with Austen's language more fresh in my mind and ear, the departures from her words, and the made up dialogue and scenes (some of which are necessary - she never writes much dialogue for proposal scenes - and some of which are extremely unnecessary) were more jarring.  There were some cringeworthy changes - making Mr. Bennett weepy in the scene where he gives Lizzy's marriage his blessing; ""Yes, a thousand times yes"" spoken by Jane when she accepts Bingley's proposal, and most sadly, one of my favorite lines: ""you have bewitched me, body and soul, and I never want to be parted from you again."" It's just too pulpy for Austen - she would absolutely have made fun of such language.Despite these criticisms, it stands the test of time - it's one of my favorite Austen adaptations, alongside Emma (2009) and Mansfield Park (1999) by Patricia Rozema - another that's absolutely beautiful to watch but departs enough from the book to make a lot of fans angry.",4,Stands up over time,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,2477,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'probably', 'theatre', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'entranced', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'had', 'nothing', 'compare', ""'d"", 'only', 'read', 'book', 'once', 'years', 'came', 'fresh', 'based', 'opinion', 'only', 'what', 'was', 'onscreen', 'thought', 'Knightley', 'was', 'brilliant', 'captured', 'lighthearted', 'also', 'serious', 'sides', 'Lizzy', 'MacFadyen', 'was', 'have', 'say', 'dreamboat', 'filming', 'amazing', 'tracking', 'shots', 'way', 'window', 'character', 'actors', 'playing', 'other', 'roles', 'Blethyn', 'Hollander', 'Dench', 'are', 'FANTASTIC', 'incredible', 'scenery', 'lively', 'earthy', 'settings', 'loved', 'even', 'set', 'music', 'phone', 'ringtone', 'watched', 'occasionally', 'TV', 'years', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'it.I', 'just', 'bought', 'DVD', 'June', '2012', '7', 'years', 'later', 'watched', 'way', 'one', 'sitting', 'last', 'few', 'years', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Austen', 'several', 'times', 'watched', 'many', 'film', 'TV', 'adaptations', 'including', 'Firth/Ehle', 'P', 'P', '2009', 'Emma', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'Romola', 'Garai', '4', 'part', 'mini-series', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'truer', 'plot', 'pace', 'book', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'can', 'P', 'P', 'speed', 'plot', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'notice', 'more', 'now', 'miss', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'true', 'friendship', 'Darcy', 'Elizabeth.I', 'still', 'love', 'lot', 'gorgeous', 'acting', 'mostly', 'wonderful', 'Austen', 'language', 'more', 'fresh', 'mind', 'ear', 'departures', 'words', 'made', 'up', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'are', 'necessary', 'never', 'much', 'dialogue', 'proposal', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'unnecessary', 'were', 'more', 'jarring', 'were', 'cringeworthy', 'changes', 'making', 'Mr.', 'Bennett', 'scene', 'where', 'Lizzy', 'marriage', 'blessing', 'Yes', 'thousand', 'times', 'yes', 'spoken', 'Jane', 'when', 'Bingley', 'proposal', 'most', 'sadly', 'one', 'favorite', 'lines', 'have', 'bewitched', 'body', 'soul', 'never', 'want', 'be', 'parted', 'again', 'just', 'too', 'pulpy', 'Austen', 'would', 'absolutely', 'have', 'made', 'fun', 'such', 'language.Despite', 'criticisms', 'test', 'time', 'one', 'favorite', 'Austen', 'adaptations', 'alongside', 'Emma', '2009', 'Mansfield', 'Park', '1999', 'Patricia', 'Rozema', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'departs', 'enough', 'book', 'make', 'lot', 'fans', 'angry']",N/A
640736,A8F2AZWB20X1H,B00005JOHI,JLind555,"[13, 15]","I've lost count of how many films have been made of Jane Austen's best-loved book, but this latest release is far from the worst. That dubious honor in my view goes to the 1942 movie that had the characters parading around in what looked like wardrobe rejects from ""Gone With the Wind"" and Greer Garson at age 36 trying to convincingly play a 20 year old ingenue. Give me a break.The latest film, directed by Joe Wright, is a fairly faithful retelling of Austen's plot, which almost everybody and his mother is familiar with by now, with gorgeous visuals to hook us squarely into the time and place. The visuals, in fact, are so beautiful to look at that at times they tend to overwhelm the story.For anyone out there -- if there is anyone out there -- who doesn't know the plot, ""Pride and Prejudice"" introduces us to the Bennet family who belong to the upper-middle-class landed gentry in late 18th century England. The second daughter, Elizabeth, sharp as a marble and pretty to boot, meets Mr. Darcy, a tall, dark, handsome and single young man with money out the wazoo. It's loathing at first sight. He despises her middle-class connections; she thinks he's a stuck-up snob with an attitude. The rest of the story has them finding out how wrong they are about each other; there are a lot of interesting plot twists and turns, but in the end, of course, almost everybody ends up living happily ever after.Jane Austen told her sister Cassandra that she thought the book was ""rather too light and bright and sparkling"" but that is exactly what has endeared it to generations of readers in print and on film. Who doesn't love a good love story? But there is a problem with this version; perhaps, in trying to tell the whole story in two hours, it's told too much and not enough both at once. The second and third versions of ""Pride and Prejudice"", on BBC in 1980 and A&E; in 1995, were serialized over four to five hours and told the story pretty much as Austen wrote it, especially the BBC version, my personal favorite. Joe Wright's film tries to tell the whole story also but there's too much story for two hours to do it justice. As a result, the film feels compressed in spots. It feels truncated. We don't see nearly enough of Elizabeth's Aunt and Uncle Gardiner, two characters who are central to the book; Bingley's married sister and her husband are left out altogether, and the whole movie has a kind of rushed quality. You won't notice it if you haven't read the book and/or seen the BBC or A&E; movies, but you'll notice it a lot if you have.Joe Wright also took some positively unsettling liberties with the Bennets. In Austen's book they are an upper-middle-class family who are the ""principal inhabitants"" of the neighborhood. In Wright's film, they look like they've gone to seed. The cows are mooing in the back yard, the pigs are ambling into the premises through the back door, a harried-looking Mrs. Bennet and her daughters are toiling in the kitchen (although in the book Mrs. Bennet indignantly tells the Reverend Mr. Collins that her daughters have nothing to do in the kitchen as the family is perfectly well able to afford a good cook), and a bleary-eyed Mr. Bennet sits in his library looking unwashed, uncombed and unkempt. The whole establishment looks drab and dingy, in need of a good paint job. In the earlier movies Longbourn looks like a fairly prosperous estate; this movie conjures up images of Tobacco Road.Keira Knightley is a delight to watch as Elizabeth Bennet; she's smart, sassy and easy on the eyes. She's as good as Elizabeth Garvie was in the role in the BBC version and she's an improvement over Jennifer Ehle. Belinda Blethlyn is funny and ditzy as Mrs. Bennet, an insufferable airhead whose one goal in life is to marry off her brood. Dame Judi Dench is suitably Gorgon-like as Lady Catherine DeBourgh; it's a shame we don't see enough of her in the film either.The big problem for this reviewer was Matthew McFayden's interpretation of Darcy. For a lot of people who saw the other films, the gold standard for Darcy was Colin Firth, although not for this reviewer; I thought Firth was miscast as Darcy (ducking brickbats from Firth groupies as I type this). Firth was trying to be a very 90's Darcy, sensitive and vulnerable; but his Darcy wasn't Austen's Darcy by a long shot. McFayden plays Darcy as if he were racked with inner torment over his wealth and status; he comes off almost as insecure. If there is one thing Austen's Darcy isn't, it's insecure; he's almost too full of himself to be real until Elizabeth knocks him down a few pegs. McFayden was trying to bring out Darcy's soft side -- he has one, underneath all that starched armor -- but in doing so he underplays Darcy's haughty exterior to the point that we wonder what Elizabeth found so revolting about him in the first place. Something doesn't add up.Taken as a whole, the movie delivers in the time it has to do it in. There is no way to faithfully put ""Pride and Prejudice"" on film in only two hours. But the essence of the story is there. It's lovely to watch and nice to listen to. Wright does a creditable job of bring Austen's best-loved book to the screen. I just wish he'd made it into a longer film.Judy Lind",4,Austen abridged,1132704000,"11 23, 2005",2005,5239,"[""'ve"", 'lost', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Jane',

To make it more difficult, like the speech, they are displayed only fleetingly and it is too often impossible to read them before they are gone.

640749,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JOHI,Joseph Haschka,"[15, 20]","Some considerable time ago, I watched the BBC miniseries presentation of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, a chick-flick if there ever was one starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, at the urging of a Jane Austen-obsessed female friend. When I reluctantly admitted that I thoroughly enjoyed it, I realized that I must resign my long-standing membership in the Neanderthal Male Fellowship. Now, much to my horror and apparently diminished masculinity, I have to say that this 2005 version of P & P was even more captivating and better than the BBC version in all respects, albeit much shorter in length.The plot of P & P needs no extensive recapitulation here; if you don't know it by now after many cinematic renderings, then forget it. Briefly, the story surrounds five unwed daughters of a son-less English country gentleman, Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland), in financial decline in the early 19th century (or, as in this new version, the late 18th). The girls, particularly the eldest Jane (Rosamund Pike), the second eldest, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), and the third eldest, Lydia (Jena Malone), get caught up in a romantic tangle with a plethora of would-be suitors: the perky young gentleman Charles Bingley (Simon Woods), the darkly moody young nobleman Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), the dashing Army officer Lt. Wickham (Rupert Friend), and the weasley cleric cousin William Collins (Tom Hollander). The girls' fear of impending spinsterhood is whipped into a froth by the maternal anxieties of their foolish and marriage-obsessed mother (Brenda Blethyn). Mr. Bennet accepts his fate as the sole male in this estrogen-driven household with a certain bemused resignation. In any case, the focus of the story is on Elizabeth (""Lizzie"") and Darcy, whom the former initially despises as arrogant and boorish. It's Darcy's pride and Lizzie's prejudice that must come to terms in this comic opera of social customs and manners.This version of P & P has been criticized by purists for at least two reasons, both of which are irrelevant to me since I haven't read, nor do I intend to read, the original Austen novel. First, the financial health of the Bennet clan is, apparently, reduced from that in the book (and, indeed, from that in the BBC miniseries). Indeed, while the family still employs servants and seems to have enough food on the table, their lifestyle here is noticeably more seedy - almost grubby - than previously depicted. Well, why not? It's this desperate condition caused by an aging patriarch and lack of a male heir that has Mom and her brood worked into a frenzy about their future prospects. Indeed, cousin William, due to inherit the estate on Mr. Bennet's death, is already nosing around inspecting the goods. Second, fault has been found with Macfadyen's Darcy as less obstinate, i.e. self-assured, in his pride than Firth's version. Now, while I readily admit that Firth's Darcy is perhaps his career's best role, I find Colin generally to be a Lump in all his screen roles. Matthew's version displays an anguished vulnerability beneath the proud veneer that's tapped by his attraction to Keira's Lizzie. And what man in his right mind wouldn't be? Keira's version is a Bewitching Babe with two capital Bs. (All through the screening, I strained to remember where I'd seen Macfadyen before; he's not exactly a familiar face on American Big Screens. Afterwards, I remembered that he plays the lead in the current British telly miniseries ""MI5"".)This P & P, as befitting a major production, has cinematography that is, at times, positively luminous, and the camera work is more adroit and clever than anything seen previous. Three scenes were, for me, particularly memorable: the visual isolation of Lizzie and Darcy from the rest of the revelers at The Ball, Lizzie's changing view of the Bennet estate as she spins in a swing hung under an arch, and Mrs. Bennet's inclusion, white petticoats flying, in a flock of scurrying white, silly geese as she pursues a rebellious daughter across the yard. These visuals were positively inspired.There are no acting performances here anything less than superb. Special mention must be given to Judi Dench as the imperious Lady Catherine, Sutherland as the overwhelmed, gentle Mr. Bennet, and Hollander's brilliant rendition of the pathetic Collins.Yes, I like this PRIDE AND PREJUDICE more than I can adequately explain.

The movie concerns four daughters who all get married and their mother who is obsessed with getting them to the altar. Two get married to jerks, two of them to nice guys. But the main story revolves around Elizabeth and Mr Darcy, and how they go from hating each other to falling in love. This would be romantic... if they had spent any time together! But they fall completely in hate and love after a few short sporatic conversations, with scarcely any time alone. Maybe that's how people fell in love in the early 19th century, but I just wasn't convinced. I felt like these characters still hardly even knew each other.

640757,A2HWJS01XEGJK8,B00005JOHI,"Julie ""Give me your tired heroines , your hud...","[41, 71]","For the sake of starting with something positive, let's throw out the very biggest problems like historical placement and accuracy. Being set a full 50 years earlier than Austen's story is entirely wrong but not worth bleating over. Oddly, the best way to portray rural dwellers of the day is deny them soap and water. There is a strange film over everyone as if they'd all been awake for a solid week and were not given time to shower before getting onto the set. Let's even try to forgive Grand Mal errors like Bingley entering the bedroom of an overnight female guest. Huh? If we can get stupid enough to ignore a boat load of other similar problems, we might at least admit that this movie was beautifully designed and very well captured. Watch this thing with the sound off, and you'll enjoy some remarkable cinematography.But no lavish castles or livid sunrises can rescue this mess.First, we'd have to cut off the head of the beast in terms of raw materials and leadership. The screenplay borders on jabberwocky, honoring only the most banal of Austen's dialog.  And despite being the epic romance, director Joe Wright isn't able to coax anything more than a lukewarm shrug from any of the key players.Speaking of key players, let's look at casting.Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean, King Arthur) reduces the smart and self-possessed Elizabeth to little more than teen petulance. She strides triumphant through the movie, always armed with some well worn leather-bound tome (we can safely assume it's not Stanislavski), looking for ways to disarm people with her aplomb. Unfortunately, Knightley has a limited number of tools with which to construct the fa?ade. One is a frightening and toothsome grin-laugh thing that turns her into a Rankin/Bass villain (a'la Burgermeister, the Bumble, HeatMiser, etc). The rest of the time, Knightley relies on her jutting jaw and droopy lip to illicit a blatant sexuality (which happens to be completely wrong for this character). However, instead of pouty sex kitten, this trick looks as if a large dose of thorazine is just kicking in. We half expect a ribbon of drool to escape down her chin at any moment.Then there is our darling Darcy. No one will ever touch the haughty torment of Colin Firth. Even if we hadn't seen Firth's Darcy, Macfadyen would seem a bit flat. We get precious little of his prickly pride (which is fairly significant to the story, being in the title and all). His too-soft underbelly is exposed the minute he sets eyes on Elizabeth, which irrevocably breaks the seal on his crusty credibility. The most powerful aspect of this romance is how it so utterly surprises Elizabeth - and us - when he makes that first proposal. Watching Macfadyen spill the beans in his first 10 seconds on screen leaves very little reason to keep watching. He could have benefited from just a bit of Caroline Bingley's over-the-top nastiness.As for the rest of the cast, they come in two flavors: shallow and boring, or giggly and squirming like cheerleaders in the back of the bus. One has to wonder if it took more than thorazine to get the rest of the cast through this project, particularly after seeing Donald Sutherland's version of Mr. Bennett. Dreamy and completely disconnected, laudanum appears to be his buffer of choice. Of course we expect Lydia and Kitty to be in the throes of an Ecstasy binge, which they are, yet still manage to disappoint us. And poor Mr. Collins (actor Tom Hollander, who also plays the deliciously neurotic and ruined Anthony Meredith in Gosford Park) is stoned out of his head and on the brink of full-on paranoia, although trying very ...hard ...not to be. He was definitely capable of giving David Bamber (the A&E; version Collins) a run for his money in this role. Unfortunately, ""big eyes and stick-in-the-arse marionette movement"" must have been Wright's direction for the unfortunate Hollander.Countless smaller irritations abound: The evil Mr. Wickham has roughly 9 words of dialog with which to make us first love and then despise him (a fancy trick for any actor, let alone someone with no noticeable screen time). Dame Judy Dench is cast once again as the fiery old crone (Lady Catherine de Bourg) which is exactly the same as every other role she's been saddled with for the last 10 years. What a tragic waste.  Even Charles Bingley's sunny disposition seems to be drawn in crayon. Far from the agreeable innocent we all adore, he comes off as weak and mildly retarded (and seemingly incapable of combing his particularly unruly shock of red hair). The result is some kind of love child of Liberace and Howdy Doody. Darcy would have never befriended someone like this. And not just because of the hair. Brenda Blethyn (Little Voice, Saving Grace) turns in the only enjoyable performance as the terminally squirrelly Mrs. Bennett. At least she's fun to watch, albeit in the manner of a fuzzy rodent with a firecracker tied to her tail.This is two thumbs way, way down. Down as in, to induce vomit after accidentally ingesting drain opener. The only thing that might have been slightly harder to swallow was the 2003 modernized version sent up by director Andrew Black. I'd rather see JACK Black in the director's chair. Naked.When will Hollywood learn that unless you bleed every 28 days or are named Ang Lee, you're not qualified to handle Jane Austen? Go tackle the Bronte sisters. And there must be at least a half dozen more gladiator movies waiting to be made or remade. Heck, take Dickens on another spin around the dance floor! But leave the next Austen adaptation to the BBC or PBS where they might still care more about characters and story than honoring a 5-picture deal for the latest tarted-up teen stars.",1,"Visual Feast,

Ah, but it is Matthew's Darcy who grabs this viewer throughout.  It's he I hope to see, who I watch for to appear in every scene, background....foreground....where is he?  But, why he, you may ask?  Well, it's because of the ""Darcy's fall"" which we begin to see that he is giving us.

In order of my passion for them, they are:  (1) The pouring rain, outdoor pavilion scene where ""Darcy's fall"" has neared its end and he declares his love to Lizzie (the intensity of that final moment, with their physical closeness and their seen and felt overpowering desire to kiss, is overwhelming for us).  (2)  That near-dawn, meadow scene in which each discovers the other walking, Lizzie because her fear of lost love keeps her from sleeping, Darcy because he must seek her out for one last try.

They do not do justice at all to the closeness of Lizzie and Jane and they don't even TOUCH on the closeness between Lizzie and Mr. Bennett, which is a HUGE injustice to the story.  And Mr. Collins isn't silly enough; he is just dull and not an asset to the film at all.  And Mr. Bingley acts an idiot who isn't educated at all.  Very sad.Everything about it is just WRONG.  Kiera Knightley is NOT a Lizzie at all.  She doesn't have it in her.  The only remotely good thing about this film is Judi Dench as Lady Catherine.  Dench is such an excellent actress and brings a bit of quality to any film she does, no matter how bad it is otherwise.Save your time and money and watch the BBC version with Colin Firth.

I have so much loved that version that I watched this determined not to like it. I didn't hate it but compared to Firth and Ehle (and the entire cast of that version) I just couldn't reach the same appreciation for the newer version. It probably isn't fair to compare the cast of this one to the other, however I do. Charlotte Lucas looks like she is 12 instead of 27. Col Fitzwilliam is a pudgy military officer. Georgiana Darcy is played by the same girl who was Henry VIII's 5th wife and plays her as a valley girl just like she did in The Tudors instead of the shy girl portrayed in the book and in the BBC version. Mr. and Mrs. Gardner were also portrayed as rather shabby people even though they were affluent enough through his business to have a London house, carriages etc. Their children don't exist in this version - in fact, Mrs. Bennet proclaims they have no children - even though we know that they did. Even though a two hour movie can't support the same number of characters as the 5 hour version, the omissions are really egregious.I did feel that probably this version was more historically accurate with the depiction of the Bennet house and the village...much more drab and rustic. Piles of manure on the roads and paths, sloppier animal pens etc. But it did not make for more pleasurable viewing. While the Bennet's were not of the same wealth as Darcy or Bingley, they did not reside in the hovel surrounded by pig stys shown in this version. The family all dressed very dis-shelved and drab. Mrs. Bennet would never  allow her daughters to roam around barefoot and sloppy. If anything, she was always trying to behave and live in a higher class manner than their income supported. The house is dark and shabby even though it is an estate.Perhaps if I'd never seen the A&E;/BBC version, I might have appreciated this one more, however I don't think I would have the same appreciation for the story.

I do not understand why the director chose to make the Bennetts out to be paupers. A family of such low status would NEVER have mixed with higher society such as the Bingleys or Darcys. Also, Englishmen of the time would NOT have appreciated the common, casual manners of the actors. There is one scene of Keira Knightley flopping on a couch,and while watching it I just wanted to cry. Also, in the book, Jane was the prettiest of the Bennett girls, while in the movie she looks kind of freakish. I think this is a sad example of politically correct re-writing of history to remove the sense of class differences. The dinner free for all was a total joke. Anyone even remotely familiar with proper English manners would understand that if a family ate like that they would have been on the VERY bottom rungs of society. Mr. Darcy as portrayed in this movie looks continually like he's in need of a hug, and is not the proud character that Firth so brilliantly brought to life in the BBC version.

THE P&P is hard to live up to! All in all though, I enjoyed this movie version immensely and went back to see it again right away. In and of itself, it is a delightful version of the story and even compared, it stands up on its own as another interpretation and look at the characters and events of this prima Austen work. The more I watch this movie (as a pick me up at home alone or with family or friends, with my feet up and a favorite something to nibble or sip on), the more I adore it. Let's face it; we can get our P&P fix faster/easier: in 2 hours instead of 5! (I still MUST watch the 5 hour version regularly as well.) This film version has a grittier, lowlier feel (perhaps a more realistic one) at the Bennet's and beyond, plus a more opulent contrast at Pemberly and related. One key detail that impressed me greatly was how I did not like Darcy nor see any attraction to the man at the beginning (how could HE be Darcy?!), but over time, he became more and more sympathetic (even appearing a pathetic figure at times: pitifully sunk in unrequited love - which pulled fully at my feelings to cheer him on in Elizabeth's direction) and attractive as the character - and this was as it should be.

640782,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JOHI,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[9, 11]","Out of all Jane Austen's literary works Pride and Prejudice is the novel most people identify with her.  It is a story similar to many other masterpieces, as it tells a story of love.  Yet, it is so much more than a mere love story that unites aching hearts.  It brings out the strong patriarchal traditions and social class system that governs the society at the turn of the century between the 18th and 19th century.  Aristocratic women at this time avoided physical labor while prudently sitting still much like well-trained lap dogs in order to attract a proper suitor with high social status, wealth, and refined etiquette.  Thus, love was something secondary, as marriage provided the means for a woman to function with some freedom within in a society with intricate and rigorous rules.  Austen thought differently, and subtly assaulted the establishment with eloquent wit and delicate humor in her tour de force.Joe Wright is not the first director to attempt to provide a cinematic version of Austen's celebrated novel.  Two handfuls of adaptations have retold the story of Pride and Prejudice, yet Wright succeeds in delivering one of the best.  He remains true to the novel (despite its short format), while also capturing the social atmosphere in a genuine manner.  Besides applying the proper etiquette in a convincing manner, Wright makes sure that the film also looks authentic through details of muddy hems and the real class difference between people emerges through the actors' costumes.  Wright also enhances the storyline with breathtaking scenery ranging from dewy dawns at the edge of the forest to death springing cliffs, which helps to artistically reveal the emotional and social situation of the moment.  Much of this is also thanks to the terrific cinematography in the film by Roman Oshin.The opening shot displays the sun emerging above the tree line while the song of birds accompanied by a lone piano aurally enhance the scene.  The dawning obviously suggests in a symbolic way of a new beginning, as Pride & Prejudice is about to take its course.  In the very next shot, Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Bennet (Keira Knightley) wanders a meadow while finishing a book.  The contrasting elements in these two sequential scenes provide a slight hint toward Lizzy's delicate rebelliousness, which is augmented by her sisters tendency to remain at home while she gladly roam the outdoors by herself.  The slight social disobedience that Lizzy possesses presents the major reason why the story takes place at all, as all other female characters around them follow the traditional rules that govern them.Lizzy's footsteps lead her home where the story quickly begins to take form, as it becomes known that Mr. Bingley (Simon Wood) has arrived to the Netherfield Park and he collects a substantial annual income.  Along with the wealth he has a high-ranking social status and is single.  The mother Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) rapidly begins to plan for her daughters to meet the gentleman, as her lot in life is to make sure that her daughters get married.  Meanwhile, her husband, Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland), leisurely goes about his business to study plants and insects, as all five of his daughters are preparing to meet the gentleman.  It is yet another subtle illustration of males' acquired superior status due to a chromosome that eventually makes them men.As the story unfolds, Mr. Bingley falls in love with Jane Bennet (Rosamund Pike) and he begins to court her.  At the same time, Lizzy finds her heart crushed by Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) who plays the status card against her, and Lizzy decides to hate him for all eternity.  Ellizabeth also learns about a family secret between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Wickham (Rupert Friend), which only increases her contempt for Mr. Darcy.  In the process, Elizabeth learns that Mr. Bingley has abandoned his pursuit for Jane's heart and hand.  Amidst of all this, Elizabeth also declines (something unheard of at the time) a marriage with her wealthy and distant cousin.  Instead the cousin marries her best friend, and the plot continues to thicken when she is invited to stay with her friend, as she also meets Mr. Darcy again who seems to have an ulterior agenda.If the viewers have not read the book by Austen, the film will certainly present a deep appreciation for her literary cunningness.  The many side plots keep the audience intrigued while the focus follows whether the truly beloved will find one another.  Yet, underneath this overt love story, Austen presents a true image of a woman's lot in life, which Wright skillfully captures.  Another aspect that makes this story unique is its deep understanding of human cognition besides the social message, which shines through its profound use of generalizations, assumptions, and preconceived notions.  Many of the cast members help bring out the many qualities in the script in a brilliant manner with the performing highlights in Keira Knightley, Brenda Blethyn, and Donald Sutherland.  Keira Knightly received an Oscar nomination her part as Lizzy, but I feel that Brenda Blethyn was robbed from a supporting role nomination, as the energetically scheming mother.  In the end, Pride & Prejudice presents an adaptation worthy of Austen's literary dexterity, which entertains and offers contemplation to those who seek something meaningful.",5,Eloquent and Witty

Of course everyone, especially the devout Jane Austen fans will say that they best version of the story is the 1995 version with Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle.  I have to agree with them, it is the gold standard when it comes to Pride and Prejudice.I was convinced that I was going to hate this version.  At first I could not see Matthew Macfayden as Mr. Darcy, it just did not seem right to me.  Not to mention the fact that it would be a shorter movie so I felt that it probably would not do the book justice.  After the first time I watched it, I thought it was okay.  I found the dialogue fast-paced, and I thought they left some major scenes out. I also thought that people who were not familiar with the story might get confused as somethings were not explained very well or misleading.The second time I watched it, I don't know what happened but it all fell together better and it was like magic.  I fell in love with Matthew Macfayden as Mr. Darcy (he almost peaks Colin Firth in my opinion) and the chemistry he has with Keira Knightley is just electric.  From their first meeting, the atmosphere is so charged with it the audience can feel it. If you step away from the plot, and look at the movie by itself it just shines, even though they stray from the book how they present the story is just lovely, and maybe more relatible to us today.  My heart still flutters at the end of the movie in the early morning when Mr. Darcy comes to speak with Elizabeth again.  I find myself sobbing, even though I have watched it countless times.Even though, the 1995 version is the best made from the screenplay by Andrew Davies to the acting and costume this version starring Matthew Macfayden and Keira Knightley offers a different perspective to the story that is fresh and exciting and is well worth watching.",5,"Fresh, Exciting",1294012800,"01 3, 2011",2011,1952,"['most', 'important', 'thing', 'say', 'when', 'concerning', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'are', 'many', 'versions', 'story', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'course', 'everyone', 'especially', 'devout', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fans', 'will', 'say', 'best', 'version', 'story', '1995', 'version', 'Colin', 'Firth/Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'have', 'agree', 'gold', 'standard', 'when', 'Pride', 'Prejudice.I', 'was', 'convinced', 'was', 'going', 'hate', 'version', 'first', 'could', 'not', 'see', 'Matthew', 'Macfayden', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'right', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'shorter', 'movie', 'felt', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'book', 'justice', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'thought', 'was', 'okay', 'found', 'dialogue', 'fast-paced', 'thought', 'left', 'major', 'scenes', 'out', 'also', 'thought', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'familiar', 'story', 'might', 'get', 'confused', 'somethings', 'were', 'not', 'explained', 'very', 'well', 'misleading.The', 'second', 'time', 'watched', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'fell', 'together', 'better', 'was', 'magic', 'fell', 'love', 'Matthew', 'Macfayden', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'almost', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'opinion', 'chemistry', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'just', 'electric', 'first', 'meeting', 'atmosphere', 'so', 'charged', 'audience', 'can', 'feel', 'step', 'away', 'plot', 'look', 'movie', 'just', 'shines', 'even', 'stray', 'book', 'how', 'present', 'story', 'just', 'lovely', 'maybe', 'more', 'relatible', 'today', 'heart', 'still', 'flutters', 'end', 'movie', 'early', 'morning', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'speak', 'Elizabeth', 'again', 'find', 'sobbing', 'even', 'have', 'watched', 'countless', 'times.Even', '1995', 'version', 'best', 'made', 'screenplay', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'acting', 'costume', 'version', 'starring', 'Matthew', 'Macfayden', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'different', 'perspective', 'story', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

I'm a fan of Jane Austen's books, partly because she seemed to be ahead of her times as concerns the rights of women (she didn't accept the 'place' they were caught in), and she wrote with such a sense of humor. Though I enjoyed the serial with Firth in it also, this 'take' caught her sense of humor, and I've never seen a woman deliver her lines for Elizabeth with such an impish glee as Keira Knightley gave. Yes, there were a few changes in the story...but on the whole I think Austen would have been pleased.It had been years since I'd seen Donald Sutherland play such a good part for him, and do it so well. You can see Elizabeth's frustration with her bookish father's inability to put his foot down to control his frivolous younger daughter.

640793,A26KIF01GEUXBT,B00005JOHI,Kyle Pratt,"[6, 11]","This adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel is one of the best to come out of Hollywood.Austen's novel begins with, ""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.""  In Pride and Prejudice Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) supplies the prejudice.  The pride comes from Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) who finds Elizabeth attractive and intelligent but beneath him.  Miss Bennet finds Mr. Darcy a snob.  Both play their parts well.However, Jane Austen novels are set at a slower time and written for people who had the time to read them.  They are leisurely affairs to be read over days.  Therefore, no movie of 129 minutes can adequately capture the depth of her genius.  That is why I have always enjoyed the A&E;/BBC miniseries with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  While the miniseries did not have the budget of the movie, it had time, 300 minutes, to develop the plot.  Although the opening scene in the miniseries is not in Austen's novel, whole pages of text are presented verbatim.Another strength of the movie is the excellent cinematography.  The sets and scenes are exquisitely shot.  However, the movie has been criticized for making the Bennet family appear lower in class.  We are never sure from the novel exactly what Mr. Darcy found objectionable with the Bennet family.  I would say that the movie portrays the difference in class between the two families well.  Demonstrating this class difference might even be a weakness of the miniseries.  I am not bothered by the modernization of the dialogue, this helps the modern audience enjoy the movie, but what does bother me is the modernization of etiquette and morals.  Men and women of the time did not casually allow visitors in their bedrooms or when they were only partially dressed.I enjoy and study Regency and Victorian literature and have seen every Austen movie ever made and read her books.  I have both this movie and the miniseries in my collection and enjoy them both.  I have rated the movie four-stars in comparison to the A&E;/BBC miniseries.  For fans of Jane Austen, both are well worth watching.Kyle Pratt",4,Superior Adaptation of Austen's Novel,1160611200,"10 12, 2006",2006,2158,"['adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', '1813', 'novel', 'one', 'best', 'come', 'Hollywood.Austen', 'novel', 'truth', 'universally', 'acknowledged', 'single', 'man', 'possession', 'good', 'fortune', 'must', 'be', 'want', 'wife', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'prejudice', 'pride', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'who', 'Elizabeth', 'attractive', 'intelligent', 'beneath', 'Miss', 'Bennet', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'snob', 'play', 'parts', 'well.However', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novels', 'are', 'set', 'slower', 'time', 'written', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'time', 'read', 'are', 'leisurely', 'affairs', 'be', 'read', 'days', 'Therefore', 'movie', '129', 'minutes', 'can', 'adequately', 'capture', 'depth', 'genius', 'why', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'A', 'E', 'miniseries', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'miniseries', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'budget', 'movie', 'had', 'time', '300', 'minutes', 'develop', 'plot', 'opening', 'scene', 'miniseries', 'not', 'Austen', 'novel', 'whole', 'pages', 'text', 'are', 'presented', 'verbatim.Another', 'strength', 'movie', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'sets', 'scenes', 'are', 'exquisitely', 'shot', 'However', 'movie', 'been', 'criticized', 'making', 'Bennet', 'family', 'appear', 'lower', 'class', 'are', 'never', 'sure', 'novel', 'exactly', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'found', 'objectionable', 'Bennet', 'family', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'difference', 'class', 'two', 'families', 'well', 'Demonstrating', 'class', 'difference', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'weakness', 'miniseries', 'am', 'not', 'bothered', 'modernization', 'dialogue', 'modern', 'audience', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'what', 'bother', 'modernization', 'etiquette', 'morals', 'Men', 'women', 'time', 'did', 'not', 'casually', 'allow', 'visitors', 'bedrooms', 'when', 'were', 'only', 'partially', 'dressed.I', 'enjoy', 'study', 'Regency', 'Victorian', 'literature', 'have', 'seen', 'Austen', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'read', 'books', 'have', 'movie', 'miniseries', 'collection', 'enjoy', 'have', 'rated', 'movie', 'four-stars', 'comparison', 'A', 'E', '/BBC', 'miniseries', 'fans', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'watching.Kyle', 'Pratt']",N/A

It is equisitely filmed in the English countryside in an authentic century English home, wonderfully acted by a delightful and scrupulously chosen cast, beautifully produced and directed with resplendent art direction and costumes, and features Dario Marianelli's Oscar-nominated original score that is consistently endearing to the ear, mind and senses.Keira Knightley, one of England's best actors, plays Austen's heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, an Englishwoman of dubious breeding that nonetheless is headstrong, opinionated, domineering and silly. She makes good and bad decisions and is smart enough to change her mind about the bad ones. The story revolves around Lizzy and her four sisters, her parents, the royal beau that will become her husband, and members of his family. A splendid supporting cast including Donald Sutherland, Judi Densch and Jean Malone forms the foundation for Knightley's electric performance in the lead role.Jane Austen (1775-1817) was a peer of Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) and lived during the crossover from the Classical to Romantic eras in music, art and literature. Her half-dozen novels form the basis for the comedy of manners in England's class society of the 1700s. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is said to be the most romantic book ever written. Even through the script varies from the novel's storyline, this memorable film adaptation mirrors the wit, humor, empathy, love, jealousy and realism of family dynamics portrayed in Austen's novel.A cherry on top is provided by Jean Thibeaudet's rapturuous piano playing in the original score, the best film score I've heard since ""The Pianist"". While the influence of early Beethoven is clear in the main theme and much of the score is authentic to the period, some of the music is too romantic and belongs to the mid-1800s. This and other minor blemishes aside, this is a remarkable film treatment of a classic novel that provides romance, humor, wonder and satisfaction.

It is by far my favorite adaptation of Pride and Prejudice (and I've seen all the available versions except the Mormon one- 1940, 1980, 1995, and Bride and Prejudice). This movie is very realistic in that it portrays how unclean times were back then (no, it's not dirty or gross or anything, don't worry). Perhaps the filmmakers went a little too far in the case of the Bennet house, but that was done to contrast their situation to those of Darcy and Bingley.The casting is excellent. I was hesistant about Keira Knightley at first (I'd only seen a couple of her other movies and liked her in Bend it Like Beckham), but her Lizzy blew me away. She portrayed the arch, outspoken side of Lizzy as well as her sweet, unoffending nature. She also really showed the character's youth. Matthew McFayden's Darcy was totally different from any interpretation I've seen (shy, puppydog) but I couldn't call it inaccurate. He and Lizzy really have chemistry together. Brenda Blethyn was an amazing Mrs. Bennet- she is annoying and embarrassing but believable not over-the-top. Rosamunde Pike is the beautiful Jane I have been waiting for. None of the other Janes I've seen are even as pretty as Lizzy. Some of the changes people might not like (but that I love)- Bingley is more of a goof, Caroline is a little meaner, Mary is prettier, and Mr. Bennet a more caring father (this one did bother me a little).On top of the great cast, the cinemotography is breathtaking, the music is beautiful, it uses a lot of Austen's own dialogue (but changes some of it slightly), and it's also hilarious.

640803,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JOHI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[12, 16]","Like most people who love literature I was well aware that Jane Austen could write, but the idea that Keira Knightley can act and hold her own against the likes of Dame Judi Dench was a revelation.  Granted, Knightley has not particularly been called upon to turn in great acting performances in most of her films.  In ""Love Actually"" she is basically required to look pretty and her best moments are reaction shots rather than dialogue.  She has many more moments such as that in ""Pride & Prejudice,"" but she also proves herself proficient at the witty dialogue.  Knightley filmed this version as her final film as a teenager and the results are comparable to when Franco Zeffirelli cast the teenage Olivia de Hussey in ""Romeo & Juliet.""This becomes the most romantic version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" because we are not surprised along with Lizzie when Darcy shows up and makes the most backhanded proposal of marriage in the history of Western literature.  The screenplay by Deborah Moggach (Emma Thompson receives special thanks in the credits, apparently for script doctoring) makes one significant change in the proceedings by simply having the moment when Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen) falls for Lizzie clearly written on his face.  At the Meryton ball she finds the perfect moment to throw the callous words that she has overheard back into his and with the rapier still skewering her victim she turns on her heels and walks away in triumph.When next he sees her she has walked over to Mr. Bingley's house to care for her sister Jane (Rosamund Pike), who has been taken ill because of the matrimonial machinations of their mother.  Lizzie's hair is down and she is positively glowing.  When we see the look of Darcy's face it is clear that he is beyond smitten, even though through the veneer of upper class manners the signs are decidedly subtle.  From that moment on his affection becomes transparent to us, although Lizzie is surprised to learn of its existence.  Joe Wright also creates a motif where the first time Darcy and Lizzie touch, as he helps her into a carriage, resonates by an emphasis at key moments throughout the film of Darcy's hands.Elizabeth Bennett is the most delightful of the Austen heroines because she has the virtue of not backing down.  Indeed, I believe Darcy first takes real notice of her because she stands up to him at the ball.  When she refuses to back down from Lady Catherine De Bourgh (Judi Dench) at the dinner table it struck me that one of the reasons she is so attractive to Darcy is because she is not trying to be.  Certainly Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Blythen) has taught her five daughters it is how to be on their best behavior to catch a husband, and in a world of such propriety her candor is refreshing.  Darcy's curt dismissal of her looks as being tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt him, becomes ironic because for my money it is her brains that make Elizabeth Bennett a real beauty both to him and to us.The screenplay necessitates cutting much of the action to reduce the tale to a two-hour film.  I appreciated being spared the unfortunate incident of Mary at the pianoforte as well as the constructed scene for the final fadeout and my only minor complaint would be that Lady Catherine does not utter her exit line from the novel when she takes her leave of Elizabeth in their final confrontation although I fully understand that the words cannot be uttered under those circumstances and the fact that Lady Catherine shows up immediately on hearing the rumor makes up for being denied the pleasure of hearing Dame Judy declaim that line.I had heard that the Jane Austen Society was less than pleased by Knightley's posture in this film, but one of the strengths of this production is that the Bennetts clearly live in the country.  There are dirt roads that lead to their home, where a large hog wanders through the front door, and when Mr. Darcy and the Bingleys make their first appearances at the local ball the dancing has an exuberance (not to mention slapping of hands) that makes it patently clear that we are far from the hallowed halls of Pemberly or the civilized life of London.  But the outside locations are as sumptuous as the gilded rooms in this film, and cinematographer Roman Osin makes both look gorgeous.For those who consider ""Sense & Sensibility"" to be the current cinematic benchmark for Austen adaptations I can report that ""Pride & Prejudice"" is its superior in terms of both romance and comedy by virtue of both crying and laughing more at this 2005 film..  Where Ang Lee's 1995 film comes out ahead is in its depiction of sisterhood, as Jane and Lizzie cannot rival Elinor and Marianne in their bonds of affection, which is understandable since it is more central to that Austen novel.  Even so there is a cute moment of confidences shared beneath the covers and Lizzie's spirited defense of her sister's shyness.  However, this one really is all about Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.I am not at all surprise that Kngihtly received a Best Actress nomination for her performance in this film.  As is invariably the case with such films the cast of supporting players is superb.  Brenda Blethyn's Mrs. Bennett is comically painful, but Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett has a touching final scene with his daughter, Tom Hollander is toadally obnoxious as Mr. Collins, and my wife really wants to slap Jenna Malone's Lydia a couple of times.  The best thing I can say about this version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" is that I went back to the theater to see it again, and the only other movie I did that for was ""Revenge of the Sith"" (I was using it for class).

Graham ""Book Lov'r""","[18, 24]","I've read Jane Austin's Pride & Prejudice twice, seen the A&E; mini-series with Colin Firth (love him!) and I've now seen Pride & Prejudice 2005 (about four times in one week).  This is going to be a comparative between the mini-series and the movie.First of all, I think it is important to note that the mini-series is approx. five hours long and the movie is approx. half that.  This provides the mini-series with an advantage.  The mini-series is SO true to the book in just about every realm.  One has a chance to get to know the characters thoroughly and fall in love with Mr. Darcy right along with Lizzy.However, there is one major thing missing from the mini-series that the movie possessed:  PASSION!  Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy was bar none, but the young lady who played Lizzy (cannot recall her name at the moment) lacked the passion to match his own.  She also made Lizzy into far too serious a character.  In my opinion, she lacked the spunk that Lizzy had in the book.  Keep in mind, this was my opinion when I first watched the mini-series and watching the 2005 movie only made me far more aware of this opinion.  When Ms. Austin wrote Lizzy, she intended a character who was spunky, light hearted and very intelligent.  Ms. Knightly's portrayal of Lizzy matched what I had always imagined Lizzy being (and looking) like.Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfayden were by far breathtaking in the portrayals of their respective characters.  I was left breathless many times by the slight looks given by Matthew Macfayden and received by Keira Knightly.  Keira Knightly's performance of Lizzy's obvious hatred/affection for Mr. Darcy seeps through the screen into your own heart!  The passion of the 2005 movie version is undeniable!However, be aware that Hollywood did what Hollywood does best:  Fluffed it up and made it their own.  The mini-series version is so deep and involved with the original story line that it is totally engrossing.  However, the movie version brings the story to life with the passion and resonance that Ms. Austin intended.I would recommend watching both.

640815,A2HKRNELD7DGX1,B00005JOHI,Lili_K,"[6, 10]","At the beginning of my review I'd like to state that I am a die-hard Jane Austen fan. P&P; is my favourite JA book. Naturally, I've seen all possible film versions and although the 2005 version is not the best, it's not the worst either.Almost everybody considers the '95 BBC version as the best, as the most authentic, so I would like to defend this version in comparison with the latter.Nobody in their right mind should expect a movie to cover everything in a book, I mean, 2 hours is not 6 hours, right? I am not saying that the script could not have been better, because that would be carrying things a bit too far. Maybe they should've given more opportunity to Emma Thompson who turned the novel S&S; into an amazingly good script.The scenery was very dramatic and beautiful, it could really express how the characters felt and what they were like. I liked the director's down-to-earth approach to the people, costumes and surroundings - ok, maybe the pig wandering through the house was not an indispensable accessory - versus the bit sterile and almost-too-groomed average appearance in the '95 series. Although I must say that the dark brown (YUK!) dress they made Keira wear while visiting Pemberley made me cringe in my seat.Concerning the ""most important"" character ... Mr Darcy, nobody can beat Colin Firth, that's for sure. However, I found Mathew MacFadyen's awkward and shy Darcy-figure humane and endearing. And I was positively surprised by Keira Knightley's performance as Elizabeth. She was convincingly lively, vivid and fresh. The chemistry between them was obvious (one of the most mouth-wateringly delicious scenes was the first proposal in the rain!) which is a welcome difference compared to BBC's P&P; where Jennifer Ehle sadly failed - not intellectually, but sensually - to respond to Firth's wonderful, sexy presence. I always felt it was a terrible waste. So a stronger attraction on both sides was a welcome change.I liked Rosamund Pike's Jane, Tom Hollander's Mr Collins (David Bamber's performance was not simply bordering grotesque, it was grotesque!) and Brenda Blethyn's Mrs Bennet. Judi Dench as Lady Catherine was too aggressive for me and the younger girls too wild.The most disturbing thing was really the lack of time. When I first saw the film - used as I was to the detailing in the series - I was disturbed by how the events seemed to race by, but on the second show it did not bother me any more.All in all, I think the latest P&P; fresh, delicious and enjoyable despite its shortcomings and worth watching twice.",3,without prejudice,1141257600,"03 2, 2006",2006,2560,"['beginning', 'review', ""'d"", 'like', 'state', 'am', 'die-hard', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'fan', 'P', 'P', 'favourite', 'JA', 'book', 'Naturally', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'possible', 'film', 'versions', '2005', 'version', 'not', 'best', 'not', 'worst', 'either.Almost', 'everybody', ""'95"", 'BBC', 'version', 'best', 'most', 'authentic', 'would', 'like', 'defend', 'version', 'comparison', 'latter.Nobody', 'right', 'mind', 'should', 'expect', 'movie', 'cover', 'everything', 'book', 'mean', '2', 'hours', 'not', '6', 'hours', 'right', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'script', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'carrying', 'things', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'Maybe', 'should', ""'ve"", 'given', 'more', 'opportunity', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'turned', 'novel', 'S', 'S', 'amazingly', 'good', 'script.The', 'scenery', 'was', 'very', 'dramatic', 'beautiful', 'could', 'really', 'express', 'how', 'characters', 'felt', 'what', 'were', 'liked', 'director', 'down-to-earth', 'approach', 'people', 'costumes', 'surroundings', 'ok', 'maybe', 'pig', 'wandering', 'house', 'was', 'not', 'indispensable', 'accessory', 'versus', 'bit', 'sterile', 'almost-too-groomed', 'average', 'appearance', ""'95"", 'series', 'must', 'say', 'dark', 'brown', 'YUK', 'dress', 'made', 'Keira', 'wear', 'visiting', 'Pemberley', 'made', 'cringe', 'seat.Concerning', 'most', 'important', 'character', 'Mr', 'Darcy', 'nobody', 'can', 'beat', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'sure', 'However', 'found', 'Mathew', 'MacFadyen', 'awkward', 'shy', 'Darcy-figure', 'humane', 'endearing', 'was', 'positively', 'surprised', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'performance', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'convincingly', 'lively', 'vivid', 'fresh', 'chemistry', 'was', 'obvious', 'one', 'most', 'mouth-wateringly', 'delicious', 'scenes', 'was', 'first', 'proposal', 'rain', 'welcome', 'difference', 'compared', 'BBC', 'P', 'P', 'where', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'sadly', 'failed', 'not', 'intellectually', 'sensually', 'respond', 'Firth', 'wonderful', 'sexy', 'presence', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'terrible', 'waste', 'stronger', 'attraction', 'sides', 'was', 'welcome', 'change.I', 'liked', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Jane', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'Mr', 'Collins', 'David', 'Bamber', 'performance', 'was', 'not', 'simply', 'bordering', 'grotesque', 'was', 'grotesque', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Mrs', 'Bennet', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'was', 'too', 'aggressive', 'younger', 'girls', 'too', 'wild.The', 'most', 'disturbing', 'thing', 'was', 'really', 'lack', 'time', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'used', 'was', 'detailing', 'series', 'was', 'disturbed', 'how', 'events', 'seemed', 'race', 'second', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'more.All', 'think', 'latest', 'P', 'P', 'fresh', 'delicious', 'enjoyable', 'shortcomings', 'worth', 'watching', 'twice']",N/A

640819,A3NJ6TTNOIOP5I,B00005JOHI,"Linda ""laddie327""","[10, 15]","Okay, I'm a huge P&P; fan but I am not going to write a long analytical review here...there are plenty of them already.  I'm also not going to compare this movie to the 1995 version.  Comparing a two-hour movie to a six-hour mini-series is ""apples and oranges.""  Here's just a few thoughts that come to mind...*  The Bennet estate - What is with the shabby look and the  mud/farm animals everywhere?  In the book, the home is not richly decorated but it was certainly a lot more affluent than portrayed.*  The Bennet girls - Keira Knightley did a very good job portraying Lizzie...not perfect but not bad.  The actress who played Lydia was a little too over-the-top and was excessively annoying.  Rosamund Pike was very good as Jane and the other actresses playing Mary and Kitty were very good.*  Brenda Blethyn was very good as Mrs. Bennet and Donald Sutherland did okay as Mr. Bennet.  He did mumble a little too much.*  The Meryton Ball - What the heck was up with the hair...the women and the men?  Many of the extras (dancers, etc.) looked disheveled and needed a brush/comb at the very least.*  Characters missing - Where were the Hursts?*  Matthew Macfadyen was good as Darcy and the actor playing Bingley did a decent portrayal as well.*  What was the significance of the pig with the large ""assets""?*  The scene at Netherfield discussing ""accomplished women"" was dull and did not add anything to the character development or the attraction between Darcy and Elizabeth.*  Makeup - Knightley wore a lot of makeup.  Did you notice she is the only female who wears makeup?  The eye shadow is obvious as well as the blush.  The actress playing Caroline Bingley might have some makeup on but Knightley's was obvious, especially the end scene in the meadow.  Did they not have enough confidence in her ""natural"" beauty""?  Also, the gown Knightley wore at the Netherfield Ball - a wonder bra or push-up bra might have helped. Also, when the Bennet's left the ball, Lizzie was not in the carriage.  How did she get home?*  Lizzie visits Pemberly - What's with the nude statues?  A portrait of Darcy alone would have worked nicely.  Also, where did Lizzie's aunt and uncle go?  Lizzie walked back to the village.  Did they leave her behind?  They were all touring the estate together and then the aunt and uncle disappear.*  Judi Dench's (Lady Catherine) hairstyle - Way over the top!!!*  Bingley would never have used the word ""ass"", especially in the midst of proposing to Jane.*  Lady Catherine would not have visited the Bennets in the middle of the night.*  Darcy's open shirt while crossing the meadow....okay, I have to forgive that one....If Colin Firth can jump into a pond and walk around with a wet open see-through shirt...As a female, I loved both scenes.  Please forgive me Jane Austen.*  Knightley and Macfadyen worked well together and I enjoyed their scenes, especially the declaration of love/proposal scenes and the looks Darcy would throw at Lizzie.  It's the incurable romantic in me.  I also liked the scene at the Meryton Ball where Darcy asks Lizzie the ""encouraging affection"" question.  Lizzie's reply is perfect.  At Netherfield when Jane and Lizzie are leaving, Darcy's hand reaction to first touching Lizzie was also a nice touch.Overall, it was a decent version.  After 193 years, a little creative interpretation of the book is refreshing.  It is a pity that Hollywood won't spend more $ and make a longer version.  Obviously, there was a lot missing from this version due to time constraints.  In two hours, you can't develop the characters and attraction between Darcy and Elizabeth properly.  If they can make King Kong three plus hours, why can't they make a longer version of P&P...I; know...because it won't rake in as much money as the action and special effects movies do but it's a shame.Ooops...this turned out longer than I thought.",4,NOT A PERFECT VERSION BUT NOT TOO BAD,1147737600,"05 16, 2006",2006,3874,"['Okay', ""'m"", 'huge', 'P', 'P', 'fan', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'write', 'long', 'analytical', 'review', 'here', 'are', 'plenty', 'already', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'going', 'compare', 'movie', '1995', 'version', 'Comparing', 'two-hour', 'movie', 'six-hour', 'mini-series', 'apples', 'oranges', 'Here', 'just', 'few', 'thoughts', 'come', 'mind', '*', 'Bennet', 'estate', 'What', 'shabby', 'look', 'mud/farm', 'animals', 'everywhere', 'book', 'home', 'not', 'richly', 'decorated', 'was', 'certainly', 'lot', 'more', 'affluent', 'portrayed', '*', 'Bennet', 'girls', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'Lizzie', 'not', 'perfect', 'not', 'bad', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Lydia', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'was', 'excessively', 'annoying', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Jane', 'other', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Mary', 'Kitty', 'were', 'very', 'good', '*', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'did', 'okay', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'did', 'mumble', 'little', 'too', 'much', '*', 'Meryton', 'Ball', 'What', 'heck', 'was', 'up', 'hair', 'women', 'men', 'Many', 'extras', 'dancers', 'etc', 'looked', 'disheveled', 'needed', 'brush/comb', 'very', 'least', '*', 'Characters', 'missing', 'Where', 'were', 'Hursts', '*', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'was', 'good', 'Darcy', 'actor', 'playing', 'Bingley', 'did', 'decent', 'portrayal', 'as', 'well', '*', 'What', 'was', 'significance', 'pig', 'large', 'assets', 'scene', 'Netherfield', 'discussing', 'accomplished', 'women', 'was', 'dull', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'anything', 'character', 'development', 'attraction', 'Darcy', 'Elizabeth', '*', 'Makeup', 'Knightley', 'wore', 'lot', 'makeup', 'Did', 'notice', 'only', 'female', 'who', 'makeup', 'eye', 'shadow', 'obvious', 'as', 'well', 'blush', 'actress', 'playing', 'Caroline', 'Bingley', 'might', 'have', 'makeup', 'Knightley', 'was', 'obvious', 'especially', 'end', 'scene', 'meadow', 'Did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'confidence', 'natural', 'beauty', 'Also', 'gown', 'Knightley', 'wore', 'Netherfield', 'Ball', 'wonder', 'bra', 'push-up', 'bra', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'Also', 'when', 'Bennet', 'left', 'ball', 'Lizzie', 'was', 'not', 'carriage', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'home', '*', 'Lizzie', 'visits', 'Pemberly', 'What', 'nude', 'statues', 'portrait', 'Darcy', 'alone', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'nicely', 'Also', 'where', 'did', 'Lizzie', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'go', 'Lizzie', 'walked', 'back', 'village', 'Did', 'leave', 'behind', 'were', 'touring', 'estate', 'together', 'then', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'disappear', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'hairstyle', 'Way', 'top', '*', 'Bingley', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'used', 'word', 'ass', 'especially', 'midst', 'proposing', 'Jane', '*', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'visited', 'Bennets', 'middle', 'night', 'Darcy', 'open', 'shirt', 'crossing', 'meadow', '.okay', 'have', 'forgive', 'one', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'can', 'jump', 'pond', 'walk', 'wet', 'open', 'see-through', 'shirt', 'female', 'loved', 'scenes', 'Please', 'forgive', 'Jane', 'Austen', '*', 'Knightley', 'Macfadyen', 'worked', 'well', 'together', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'especially', 'declaration', 'love/proposal', 'scenes', 'looks', 'Darcy', 'would', 'throw', 'Lizzie', 'incurable', 'romantic', 'also', 'liked', 'scene', 'Meryton', 'Ball', 'where', 'Darcy', 'Lizzie', 'encouraging', 'affection', 'question', 'Lizzie', 'reply', 'perfect', 'Netherfield', 'when', 'Jane', 'Lizzie', 'are', 'leaving', 'Darcy', 'hand', 'reaction', 'first', 'touching', 'Lizzie', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'touch.Overall', 'was', 'decent', 'version', '193', 'years', 'little', 'creative', 'interpretation', 'book', 'refreshing', 'pity', 'Hollywood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spend', 'more', 'make', 'longer', 'version', 'Obviously', 'was', 'lot', 'missing', 'version', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'two', 'hours', 'ca', ""n't"", 'develop', 'characters', 'attraction', 'Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'properly', 'can', 'make', 'King', 'Kong', 'three', 'hours', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'longer', 'version', 'P', 'P', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rake', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'movies', 'do', 'shame.Ooops', 'turned', 'out', 'longer', 'thought']",N/A

It's also brings to life the social realities of matchmaking.  The acting, especially by Kiera Knightly is fantastic.  By now you must be thinking that I would heap further accolades on this film based on the Jane Austin novel.  Well, that's not going to happen.  I know this is personal taste, but I just didn't like it.For the past several hundred years, Jane Austin's novels have been the basic theme of romantic novels and films.  There's a high spirited young woman who meets a very rich man.  She's always beautiful and of marriageable age, but he is of a higher class.  At first they hate each other and he seems like a cad.  The insults fly and the young woman shows she knows how to use her words in a clever way.  This impresses the gentleman.  Little by little, the audience and the heroine start to appreciate him.  There are always obstacles.  But in the end these two main characters always hook up.No matter how well this theme is carried out in movies, TV, or romantic songs, I always find it boring.  There are no surprises and there is just so much beautiful scenery and gorgeous ball gowns that I can stand.  Often, too, if it is a British film, I cannot understand much of the dialogue and I yearn for subtitles.Recommended for romance loves only who will love this film.

This is such a great and endearing story that it is hard to mess it up (although the Bollywood bad-acid-trip ""Bride and Prejudice"" came very close!) But director, Joe Wright, showed that he was up to the task, doing a great job of retelling the foibles of the Bennet sisters. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth is strong and reminscent of a contemporary feminist while remaining true to the mores of the period. Matthew Macfadyen isn't the best Mr. Darcy, but it's hard to come behind the magnificent Colin Firth who played the role in 1995 as if he lived across the road from Jane Austin. Brenda Blethyn (Mrs. Bennet) shines as a mother on a well-planned mission to marry off FIVE daughters. Rosamund Pike (Jane) is the classic English rose while Talulah Riley's portrayal of Mary is not the usual ugly wallflower. Newcomers Jena Malone and Carey Mulligan (Lydia and Kitty) make the best clueless Victorian ""hoochies"" ever! But the real treat here is Donald Sutherland as the estrogen drowned Mr. Bennet. He has masterfully executed an unexpected role for him, exhibiting a refreshing tongue-in-cheek patience. Dame Judi Dench, always in top form, makes the best Lady Catherine De Bourgh to date. Unlike the previous adaptations, here the viewer is not bounced back and forth between London and the countryside locations and the costumes aren't overly fussy, giving the overall production an understated lushness.

The best adaptation of Jane Austen's classic book is the 5-hour miniseries created for A&E.;  In my opinion it sets the gold standard and is the version to which I compare every other version.However Keira Knightly makes a very good Elizabeth Bennett and McFadyen's Darcy is definitely worth looking at (I may be a ""mom of 5"" but my mom taught me that you're never to old to appreciate a fine looking man).  Oh and he has a great voice.This film takes liberties with the story, such as changing event settings.  For instance, in the book, Darcy did not propose to Lizzie in the pouring rain on a picturesque stone gazebo or mausoleum or whatever with a great view in the background.  However, I did enjoy the scene they added of Mr. Bingley and Darcy practicing how Bingley would propose to Jane.Overall I found the story a bit confusing and hard to follow - and I have read the book at least a dozen times.  I can't imagine how someone who never read the book would be able to follow the storyline in this movie.Donald Sutherland seems somewhat miscast as Mr. Bennett.  I guess I'm a purist - they should have cast a Brit.  And every time he laughed he had to put his hand over his mouth - I assume to hold his dentures in.

Here, we see Bennets living in a low-ceilinged house with narrow doorways, candlelight, plank floors and simple furniture. They use more pewter than silver, and their clothing is closer to homespun 18th-century, than 19th-century finery. The language is simpler, less flowery and less faithful to Jane Austen's dialog.

This coming from an avid Colin Firth fan as well. I love Colin Firth, and he will always be dear to my heart, but Matthew McFayden has earned a place next to him as well thanks to this movie. His Darcy is restrained, yet sexy, prideful and haughty, yet tender and kind of sensitive. He walks a very fine line, as only Firth has been able to walk before, and it is a delight to watch.The other characters, such as Lydia(Played by the always marvelous Jena Malone) and Mrs. Bennet, were not quite as over-the-top annoying as some of the portrayals of them in past versions. The relationship between Mr. Bennet and Lizzie seemed much more clearly defined as well (though the scene where Mr. Bennet apologizes was out of character for him...). Although I did enjoy the A&E;'s Mr. Collins, this one seems more appropriate to the period, and much more believable. Judi Dench is simply wonderful, and is the definitive Lady Catherine (even though they changed some of the scenes from the book, her portrayal of the character itself was fantastic!).The characters in this version seemed much more suited to the era then in the A&E; versions, the contrast between the Bennet's finfancial state and the Upper Class(Darcy & Bingley), was much more obvious, which was nice. The characters know their places, and they act like it. The dances also come off as more real and natural, not so staged as in the A&E; version.If all else fails to entice you, the Scenery is to die for! The English Moors are so beautiful their worth seeing the film for that alone! The scene were Mr. Darcy comes out of the mist to meet Elizabeth has to be one of ""The most geourgeous"" in cinema history.So my hope for you is this: That no matter how many times you've read the book, no matter how many film(Tv or movie) versions you've seen, you can appreciate this one as well and be able to drink in the scenery, the marvelous music, and the wonderful acting.God Bless ~Amy",5,Pride and Prejudice condenced....,1138060800,"01 24, 2006",2006,2967,"['one', 'were', 'watch', 'condensed', 'version', 'P', 'P', 'one', 'watch', 'one', 'newcomer', 'P', 'P', 'one', 'watch', 'one', 'watched', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'nine', 'million', 'times', 'may', 'want', 'something', 'fresh', 'eight', 'other', 'adaptations', 'there', 'one', 'watch', 'Granted', 'am', 'not', 'austere', 'follower', 'Austin', 'have', 'read', 'enough', 'novel', 'seen', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'enough', 'times', 'know', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'Call', 'romantic', 'am', 'call', 'idealist', 'am', 'matter', 'what', 'way', 'look', 'probably', 'best', 'theatrical', 'non-television', 'version', 'will', 'ever', 'get.It', 'true', 'spirit', 'book', 'are', 'number', 'storyline', 'omissions', 'missing', 'characters', 'key', 'scenes', 'true', 'characters', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'spunky', 'refhesing', 'Matthew', 'McFayden', 'portrayal', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'own', 'when', 'compared', 'what', 'considered', 'definitive', 'portrayal', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'coming', 'avid', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'fan', 'as', 'well', 'love', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'dear', 'heart', 'Matthew', 'McFayden', 'earned', 'place', 'next', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'Darcy', 'restrained', 'yet', 'sexy', 'prideful', 'haughty', 'tender', 'kind', 'sensitive', 'very', 'fine', 'line', 'only', 'Firth', 'been', 'able', 'walk', 'delight', 'watch.The', 'other', 'characters', 'such', 'Lydia', 'Played', 'always', 'marvelous', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'were', 'not', 'quite', 'over-the-top', 'annoying', 'portrayals', 'past', 'versions', 'relationship', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'Lizzie', 'seemed', 'much', 'more', 'clearly', 'defined', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'where', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'was', 'character', 'did', 'enjoy', 'A', 'E', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'one', 'more', 'appropriate', 'period', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'definitive', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'even', 'changed', 'scenes', 'book', 'portrayal', 'character', 'was', 'fantastic', 'characters', 'version', 'seemed', 'much', 'more', 'suited', 'era', 'then', 'A', 'E', 'versions', 'contrast', 'Bennet', 'finfancial', 'state', 'Upper', 'Class', 'Darcy', 'Bingley', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'obvious', 'was', 'nice', 'characters', 'know', 'places', 'act', 'dances', 'also', 'come', 'off', 'more', 'real', 'natural', 'not', 'so', 'staged', 'A', 'E', 'version.If', 'else', 'entice', 'Scenery', 'die', 'English', 'Moors', 'are', 'so', 'beautiful', 'worth', 'seeing', 'film', 'alone', 'scene', 'were', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'mist', 'meet', 'Elizabeth', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'geourgeous', 'cinema', 'history.So', 'hope', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'film', 'Tv', 'movie', 'versions', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'can', 'appreciate', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'able', 'drink', 'scenery', 'marvelous', 'music', 'wonderful', 'acting.God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A
640825,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B00005JOHI,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[8, 9]","Let's say up front that the 2005 Pride and Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley as Lizzie and Matthew Macfadyen as Darcy, is not meant to be a 100% accurate adaptation of the book. Trimmed down to a mere 2 hours, the story had to be cut up a great deal. It's also set in the late 1700s - when a 21 year old Jane Austen first thought up the story, instead of the early 1800s, when 38 year old Jane finally finished and published the work.That all being said, this movie is amazingly well done. In some ways, it's much more realistic than other depictions of the story. Many movie versions of P&P; have the characters set up almost like cartoon characters. They are squeaky clean, their world is pristine, and they float through it. While many in the early 1800s had nice manners, their life was certainly not Lysol-clean!It was really nice, then, to see the quiet English town actually appear like a live, working English town. The story clearly has Lizzie show up with a ton of mud on her skirts after hiking across miles of marshy English countryside. In most movie versions, that means there's a hint of brown on her trimly pressed outfit. In this version, it's much more realistic. I've hiked around England - you get muddy!In some ways, the movie is like ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" - where you hear snippets of dialogue and if you know the story, you realize what is going on in the background. It really does cater strongly to people who know the full story well and don't need all the details filled in. Again, this is to be expected given there are only 2 hours of story here. Many of the backgrounds and details are shaved or missing. The characters, however, are still quite solid and fully done.Lizzie and Darcy of course are the main characters here, and they shine with a freshness that is really great. These aren't ""story members"" just walking through and trading barbs. You really get a sense that Lizzie is a flesh and blood woman who is feeling the powerful loves, hates, and other emotions. Darcy feels the same passions, reigning them in under his family training. Many of the scenes with the two characters are just amazing - when they are dancing, when they are in the gazebo in the rain.In some ways, I even feel the movie adds to the story, helping to elucidate scenes that might otherwise go over viewers' heads. Often, Charlotte's choosing to marry Collins is seen as a quiet, calm decision made without any emotion at all. I always found this depiction to be unrealistic. In this version, Charlotte makes it clear that this wouldn't be her ideal choice - but what else can she do? Does she really want to be a spinster and burden on her family? She's full of angst, but she's done the best she could with a bad situation.Also, it's always bugged me that in some movie versions, they made a big deal about Lizzie's ""revelation"" in Darcy's home that she really would have been happy as his wife. She feels this way because his servants love him so much, a sign of a truly ""gentle man"". However, some movies turn it into a gold-digging Lizzie looking around saying ""Wow, I could have lived HERE"". I was very happy that in this movie, Lizzie is touched by the gorgeous sculpture and the way Darcy's sister loves him.Even some of the minor characters are done amazingly well. I love Sutherland and Dench, they are simply wonderful. Others are less stellar - Wickham springs to mind as being an ""elf lookalike"" - but it's hard to expect every single cast member to be stunning.Highly recommended as a must-see for anyone who loves a romantic story full of incredibly fun dialogue.",5,Amazing Job in only 2 Hours,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,3612,"['Let', 'say', 'up', 'front', '2005', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'starring', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Lizzie', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'Darcy', 'not', 'meant', 'be', '100', '%', 'accurate', 'adaptation', 'book', 'Trimmed', 'down', 'mere', '2', 'hours', 'story', 'had', 'be', 'cut', 'up', 'great', 'deal', 'also', 'set', 'late', '1700s', 'when', '21', 'year', 'old', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'first', 'thought', 'up', 'story', 'instead', 'early', '1800s', 'when', '38', 'year', 'old', 'Jane', 'finally', 'finished', 'published', 'work.That', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'amazingly', 'well', 'done', 'ways', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'other', 'depictions', 'story', 'Many', 'movie', 'versions', 'P', 'P', 'have', 'characters', 'set', 'up', 'almost', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'are', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'world', 'pristine', 'float', 'many', 'early', '1800s', 'had', 'nice', 'manners', 'life', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'Lysol-clean', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'then', 'see', 'quiet', 'English', 'town', 'actually', 'appear', 'live', 'working', 'English', 'town', 'story', 'clearly', 'Lizzie', 'show', 'up', 'ton', 'mud', 'skirts', 'hiking', 'miles', 'marshy', 'English', 'countryside', 'most', 'movie', 'versions', 'hint', 'brown', 'trimly', 'pressed', 'outfit', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', ""'ve"", 'hiked', 'England', 'get', 'muddy', 'ways', 'movie', 'Rosencrantz', 'Guildenstern', 'are', 'Dead', 'where', 'hear', 'snippets', 'dialogue', 'know', 'story', 'realize', 'what', 'going', 'background', 'really', 'cater', 'strongly', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'full', 'story', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'details', 'filled', 'Again', 'be', 'expected', 'given', 'are', 'only', '2', 'hours', 'story', 'here', 'Many', 'backgrounds', 'details', 'are', 'shaved', 'missing', 'characters', 'however', 'are', 'still', 'quite', 'solid', 'fully', 'done.Lizzie', 'Darcy', 'course', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'here', 'shine', 'freshness', 'really', 'great', 'are', ""n't"", 'story', 'members', 'just', 'walking', 'trading', 'barbs', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'Lizzie', 'flesh', 'blood', 'woman', 'who', 'feeling', 'powerful', 'loves', 'hates', 'other', 'emotions', 'Darcy', 'same', 'passions', 'reigning', 'family', 'training', 'Many', 'scenes', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'amazing', 'when', 'are', 'dancing', 'when', 'are', 'gazebo', 'rain.In', 'ways', 'even', 'feel', 'movie', 'story', 'helping', 'elucidate', 'scenes', 'might', 'otherwise', 'go', 'viewers', 'heads', 'Often', 'Charlotte', 'choosing', 'marry', 'Collins', 'seen', 'quiet', 'calm', 'decision', 'made', 'emotion', 'always', 'found', 'depiction', 'be', 'unrealistic', 'version', 'Charlotte', 'clear', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'ideal', 'choice', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'do', 'Does', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'spinster', 'burden', 'family', 'full', 'angst', 'done', 'best', 'could', 'bad', 'situation.Also', 'always', 'bugged', 'movie', 'versions', 'made', 'big', 'deal', 'Lizzie', 'revelation', 'Darcy', 'home', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'happy', 'wife', 'way', 'servants', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'sign', 'truly', 'gentle', 'man', 'However', 'movies', 'turn', 'gold-digging', 'Lizzie', 'looking', 'around', 'saying', 'Wow', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'HERE', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'movie', 'Lizzie', 'touched', 'gorgeous', 'sculpture', 'way', 'Darcy', 'sister', 'him.Even', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'done', 'amazingly', 'well', 'love', 'Sutherland', 'Dench', 'are', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'Others', 'are', 'less', 'stellar', 'Wickham', 'springs', 'mind', 'being', 'elf', 'lookalike', 'hard', 'expect', 'single', 'cast', 'member', 'be', 'stunning.Highly', 'recommended', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'who', 'romantic', 'story', 'full', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'dialogue']",N/A

640833,A2UUBPM4ZRSEQ0,B00005JOHI,"Looking out and looking in ""None""","[5, 8]","The strongest parts of this film is the real-life adaptation of the Bennet family.  We see Mrs. Bennet not as the dim-witted mother who is eager to marry her daughter's off but as a real mother concerned over real-life situations in those days.  Yes, back then a woman's ticket to a good life was to marry well but it was even harder to marry for both money and love.But that's not where the movie ends.  We are exposed to breathtaking cinematorgraphy, (Some parts of Britain I never knew exist!) and actors who are molded so well for their parts.  Kiera Knightly shines as Elizabeth Bennet in this adaptation and Jenna Malone and Carey Mulligan are not as annoying as Lydia and Kitty in the 1995 version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.One set back to this movie would be its adaptation.  For those who are exposed to the Pride and Prejudice for the first time may be left confused.  The story moves forward in some parts through narration or dialogue rather than seeing actual scenes , such as Wickham's dealings and his connection to Mr. Dary's sister.  Also, the audience has to pay attention to the background and foreground parts of the film as the story moves forward through background interactions.  This movie is so much more 'open' then previous films that (blending background with foreground)the viewer will need to pay more attention to the dialogue and try and understand the feelings of the characters (ex: Eliza's alienation during the Netherfield ball).BOTTOM LINE:This is a great film with real-life in 19th century appeal.  Mr. Darcy is more of a character to understand in this film and Ms. Bennet shines true.  I think we get more of a sense of Ms. Austen's (author) feminist views (abliet they aren't harsh ones).  Bits of the movie may need more concentration as there is blending of background/foreground.  Also, Austen truists may feel a bit cheated with only an adaptation version of the film.

While the Jane Austen purists may not approved of all the changes in this movie, I thought the script was superbly well thought out and its adopted the book into a well made two hour movie. This movie is basically the director Joe Wright's vision of the book. There is nothing wrong with it. After all, the three Lord of the Rings movies were Peter Jackson's vision of the book, not the book itself.The movie proves to be well directed and well acted. The two key characters, Lizzie and Darcy were well represented by Keira Knightley and Matthew McFadyn. Knightley proves to be the right age and she managed to captured the character of Lizzie superbly well. I thought McFadyn did well but from all I read, Colin Firth from that mini-series hold the gold standard for playing Darcy. Firth must be very good indeed. The movie choose to centered around those two characters and goes from the initial false impression of each other to realization of truth about each other. The supporting cast proves to be quite excellent, both Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench steal scenes during their limited time on the screen. I thought Brenda Blethyn who played the super annoying mother probably did the best job of all. Tom Hollander who played Cousin William Collins also proves to be excellent.

After watching the comments of those involved in writing, directing, and acting in the film it's obvious they didn't understand Austin's plot. They don't understand the customs of the time period. They didn't get the fact that Austin's book is humorous. At one point in an interview the screenwriter says the story revolves around Lizzie's pride and Darcy's prejudice. When in fact in Austin's novel it was Miss. Bennett's prejudice and Darcy's pride that caused their conflict. The screenwriter also didn't get the fact that Mr. Bennett held his wife in total contempt in Austin's story. He made fun of her in front of their children. And it was this element in the Bennett's relationship that drove the two older sisters to insist on marrying for love. They didn't want to be in marriages where they couldn't love and respect their spouses. The scenery in the movie is lovely--but too rustic. I doubt the Bennett's in Austin's novel had a large boar running through their house. And Mr. Bingley was a complete fop in this movie version. Donald Southerland reminds me of Lee Marvin in Cat Baloo. Mrs. Bennett looks and sounds like a fishwife. All in all--I cannot give it a high rating.

Cinematic gems are a rare thing these days. We seem to be surrounded by crass, unmitigated tripe (Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, G.I. Joe, Old Dogs, the Saw series, etc.) that insult the intelligence of the viewer and seek to beat us over the head with special effects and casual violence. These films and many more are worthy of disdain, and yet what do we have here but a legion of people with the myopic effrontery to slam ""Pride and Prejudice"" with a one-star review!! You people make a mockery of the rating system with your hyperbole. Many (especially old people) seem absolutely obsessed with the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version, which I liked very much as well, but thought was a bit stiff. I agree that the story moves a little too briskly in the newer version (I wish it were five hours long, too), but in all other respects I adore this movie.Keira Knightley is simply beautiful and luminous as Elizabeth Bennett, and Matthew MacFadyen brings real emotion and warmth to the proud character of Mr. Darcy. The chemistry between these two is exquisite. All of the other actors and actresses are excellent, as well, as is the cinematography. The scene in which Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, with the rain-swept countryside in the background, is handled beautifully; the emotions expressed in the faces of the two leads are spot-on and make the scene more heartfelt and engaging than anything in the 1995 version.

640838,AN94YI3URSAII,B00005JOHI,Lostgirl,"[34, 55]","I really tried to come to this movie with and open mind. I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen and I thought the 1995 BBC miniseries actually came close to doing justice to her novel. Still, I was looking foreward to seeing a new interpretation. Unfortunately this one seemed to miss the point of the story.Jane Austen had a hilarious way of satarizing the social conventions and mores while being in their midst. This film ignores the social conventions altogether and therefore misses a great deal of Austen's humor. For example an unmarried man and woman would NEVER greet each other in their pajamas. A man would never visit his fiancee while she was lying sick in bed in her nightgown. When these rules of propriety are ignored by the film, how are we supposed to understand or believe that it's a big deal when Lydia runs away with Wickham!? Another example is Lady Catherine. This is a woman who lives and dies by her snobbery and rigorous adherance to social conventions. Yet in this film we see her barge into the Bennet household in the middle of the night and wake Lizzie up to ask a question that could easily waited until morning (when Lady Catherine wouldn't have had to get her carriage driver out of bed to drive several miles in the dark- no streetlights remember- to the Bennet household) Because no one adhere's to societies rigorous, and for the most part arbitrary, rules, the movie misses the opportunies to subtly wink at the audience as it laughs at such things.Another weakness lies in the casting. Granted these actors had big shoes to fill. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle seemed to embody their characters in the 1995 miniseries, but as I said, there are other ways to interpret and play the characters. Unforunately here everyone seems as if they're reading lines with dramatic inflection- not acting. You can almost imagine Keira Knightly's script having notes saying ""insert spunkiness here"".While the scenery is lovely, the windswept cliff and farm images seem to recollect the tortured landscape of a Bronte adaptation more than a manacured Austen setting.Overall this film comes off as one big missed opportunity.",1,Not even an attempt at historical accuracy?,1164153600,"11 22, 2006",2006,2137,"['really', 'tried', 'come', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'thought', '1995', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'actually', 'came', 'close', 'doing', 'justice', 'novel', 'Still', 'was', 'looking', 'foreward', 'seeing', 'new', 'interpretation', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'seemed', 'miss', 'point', 'story.Jane', 'Austen', 'had', 'hilarious', 'way', 'satarizing', 'social', 'conventions', 'mores', 'being', 'midst', 'film', 'social', 'conventions', 'altogether', 'therefore', 'great', 'deal', 'Austen', 'humor', 'example', 'unmarried', 'man', 'woman', 'would', 'NEVER', 'greet', 'other', 'pajamas', 'man', 'would', 'never', 'visit', 'fiancee', 'was', 'lying', 'sick', 'bed', 'nightgown', 'When', 'rules', 'propriety', 'are', 'ignored', 'film', 'how', 'are', 'supposed', 'understand', 'believe', 'big', 'deal', 'when', 'Lydia', 'away', 'Wickham', 'example', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'woman', 'who', 'dies', 'snobbery', 'rigorous', 'adherance', 'social', 'conventions', 'Yet', 'film', 'see', 'barge', 'Bennet', 'household', 'middle', 'night', 'wake', 'Lizzie', 'up', 'ask', 'question', 'could', 'easily', 'waited', 'morning', 'when', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'get', 'carriage', 'driver', 'bed', 'drive', 'several', 'miles', 'dark-', 'streetlights', 'remember-', 'Bennet', 'household', 'one', 'adhere', 'societies', 'rigorous', 'most', 'part', 'arbitrary', 'rules', 'movie', 'opportunies', 'subtly', 'wink', 'audience', 'such', 'things.Another', 'weakness', 'casting', 'Granted', 'actors', 'had', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'seemed', 'embody', 'characters', '1995', 'miniseries', 'said', 'are', 'other', 'ways', 'interpret', 'play', 'characters', 'Unforunately', 'here', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'reading', 'lines', 'dramatic', 'inflection-', 'not', 'acting', 'can', 'almost', 'imagine', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'script', 'having', 'notes', 'saying', 'insert', 'spunkiness', 'here', 'scenery', 'lovely', 'windswept', 'cliff', 'farm', 'images', 'seem', 'recollect', 'tortured', 'landscape', 'Bronte', 'adaptation', 'more', 'manacured', 'Austen', 'setting.Overall', 'film', 'off', 'one', 'big', 'missed', 'opportunity']",N/A

Power ""nlp trainer""","[6, 8]","Certainly this is one of the two most intriguing versions of this movie I have seen.If Jane Austen herself were alive today, I suspect whe would love this version.In the Laurence Olivier version, I thought his Darcy came across as somewhat affected and foppish.  I have not seen the Colin Firth version yet, however I did see his depiction of Darcy in the modern Bridget Jones Diary movies, and he did seem off in his attitude towards Renee Zelwegger's character.  He seemed too snooty, and as if he genuinely disliked her at times for no reason.My other favorite version is the Bollywood version, Bride and Prejudice, a must see totally enjoyable version with the beautiful Aishwarya Rai, and replete with Bollywood conventions including musical numbers.The Keira Knightley version I have seen several times, and even made copious notes about it, because whether you know it or not, many love stories follow the template of this story, and it has become an enduring classic for good reason.The dialogue is simply beautiful, the scenes excellently executed, the lead actor Matthew MacFadyen interplays brilliantly with Keira, offering excellently nuanced scenes.  Finally, a lead actor who truly does justice to the role.Like many love stories it starts out on the wrong foot, when Darcy disses her to a friend.  He does not know she has overheard.  She responds with some later banter putting him in his place, and like the flick of a switch he becomes intrigued with her. Yet as you get deeper into the story, misunderstandings arise, new perceptions, a whole welter of emotions.I especially loved the scene where he proposes the first time and totally screws it up. She is hurt and angry, and turns on him, and yet beneath that anger stirs a passion.  Beautifully done.Mr. Darcy: ...Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances?Elizabeth Bennet: And those are the words of a gentleman. From the first moment I met you, your arrogance and conceit, your selfish disdain for the feelings of others made me realize that you were the last man in the world I could ever be prevailed upon to marry.

640842,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B00005JOHI,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[7, 13]","Joe Wright was cast to direct the latest version of ""Pride and Prejudice"". Hmmmm. Joe Wright, directed a couple of forgettable movies, followed by 3 mini-series (the little knowns ""Nature Boy"" from 2000, ""Bodily Harm"" from 2002 and a lavish, and well-made version of the life of Charles 2,""Charles II: The Power and the Passion, 2003) for A&E;/BBC. What made the powers behind the newest attempt to film Austen for the big screen choose Joe Wright?Well, Joe got it, right, that is, in many ways. He's made a more contemporary telling of this, my favorite of Austen's tales, and he's done it well. In a run time of less than 2.5 hours, his version will be more easier to digest than the two mini-series of this same work (the stand alone BBC version from 1980 with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul and the 1993 A&E;/BBC version that most people know the best; with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth). But, as well done as it is, you'll find it wanting vs. either of these fine mini-series, and the film also pales in comparison to the Emma Thompson/Ang Lee run at ""Sense and Sensibility"" in 1995.If you are an Austen fan, the amount of characterization that has to be cut from the story to fit it in to a 2.5 hour run time, will simply horrify you. In particular, both Mr. Wickam and Mr. Collins, potential suitors for the Bennett bevy, are given very small amounts of screen time. Catherine de Bourg, the patroness whose money flows all over a variety of characters in the film (Darcy, for one, is her nephew) was played by Judi Dench with a particularly elegant stiff upper lip, but was given little to do.Director Wright has given us marvelous cinematography and beautiful settings (notably Darcy's estate at Pemberley). He has the same passion I do for Austen's work, and tried to keep the themes.""Pride and Prejudice"" is a love story between a young woman in a family stretched with 5 daughters and literally no dowries in 19th century England. In the book, the Bennetts are an upper middle class lot; in this film, in which Wright instilled a sense of real ""living on the farm"", they are shabby versions of Austen's intent.Mr. Bennett (Donald Sutherland) is a country gentleman beloved by his daughters and befuddled by the antics of his wife. Said wife's main passion in life is making sure the girls are all married off so that they are not penniless when the parents die. Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Blethyn in a comedic performance that is perhaps a little over the top) makes no pretense of her intentions, and they are embraced with different degrees of exhuberance by her daughters. Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and Jane (Rosamund Pike), the eldest, are a bit embarrassed by their mother's antics and manage to try and ignore her histrionics while building their anxieties over marriage.It is Jane, the loveliest, whose heart is broken by Mr. Bingley from London, and Elizabeth who runs afoul of his dour friend, Mr. Darcy.Before the film is finished, the viewer is as surprised as Elizabeth to learn that Mr. Darcy has fallen in love with her, and having been rejected, Darcy sets out to change Elizabeth's first impression and win her heart by helping her family and by showing how much he cares for his own young sister.Keira Knightley was a good choice for Jane, although the lesser known actresses in both the British mini-series were better in the role than she was. Knightley looks the part as Austen described it, and has a quicksilver screen persona that fits Elizabeth well. If there is not the romance, the chemistry that should have grown on screen between Elizabeth and Darcy, it is not for wont of Knightley's efforts to portray it.Instead, in portraying the difficult Darcy, who, after all, is supposed to be wooden, actor Matthew Macfayden (with an impressive list of British television credentials including the MI5 drama, Spooks) was entirely too successful. He is wooden to a painful degree, and has difficulty turning his cold arrogance into foolishness when he first becomes infatuated with Elizabeth. And he's equally not credible as a ""do gooder"". The growth of that Austen staple, the love between two people who society has not meant to be together, the growing awareness, the yearning, well, it is missing from this film. It was not missing in the mini-series. Generally speaking, it usually means the director does not know how to capture the essence of love and longing on film, does not know how to invoke it from his characters and bleed it through to the audience. Despite this, I must say, that I did not walk away wishing to see Matthew Macfayden on the big screen again.And thus, we get an interesting movie, with some fine touches, some believable characters, a solid script and beautiful filming, music and costumes. But contrary to the print ads and the trailers, this is not the film of the year, just a pleasing version of an Austen tale that has been done better in the past.Definitely worth a trip to the

Smith,"[5, 6]","I found this version of my favorite novel to be very touching and romantic, though lacking much of the gently ironic tone that makes Jane Austen unique.  Mrs. Bennet, for example, was beautifully played by Brenda Blethyn, but she was rather more sweetly dithering than the constantly plotting, embarassingly outspoken character in the book. I did like the Bennet sisters' portrayals, though, and I found Darcy quite believable in his reserve and his almost painful discomfort in the rambunctious social milieu of Meryton.  The cinematography is superb, however, and the sets and costumes are flawless.  All told, the film fulfills the director's vision and gives the viewer a wonderfully intimate look at life in early nineteenth-century England.",4,"Lovely film, less Austen than Merchant/Ivory",1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,746,"['found', 'version', 'favorite', 'novel', 'be', 'very', 'touching', 'romantic', 'lacking', 'much', 'gently', 'ironic', 'tone', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'unique', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'example', 'was', 'beautifully', 'played', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'was', 'rather', 'more', 'sweetly', 'dithering', 'constantly', 'plotting', 'embarassingly', 'outspoken', 'character', 'book', 'did', 'Bennet', 'sisters', 'portrayals', 'found', 'Darcy', 'quite', 'believable', 'reserve', 'almost', 'painful', 'discomfort', 'rambunctious', 'social', 'milieu', 'Meryton', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'however', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'flawless', 'told', 'film', 'director', 'vision', 'viewer', 'wonderfully', 'intimate', 'look', 'life', 'early', 'nineteenth-century', 'England']",N/A

The relationship between Rosamund Pike (Jane) and Lizzie was just not convincingly close as depicted in the book and although this has nothing to do with the movie, . .  Keira always does this weird thing with her lips (trying to make them look fuller while pouting) that really bugs me. I like the way the set design, costumes, and the lack of to much makeup made the movie a little more ""authentic"", but what I truly loved was the music.  I felt like the music really transported me into that time.

640847,AFWNZ3NV9B8PX,B00005JOHI,lynchy,"[14, 35]","Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. It was very very rushed, as I suppose you can understand a movie length version of Pride & Prejudice would be and I felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story.As the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all.Not only that, this movie is Boring. 1/3 of the way through I started yawning and couldn't wait for the movie to be over. When they finally met in the field at the end, couldn't care less if they got together or not. As I have read the book and watch the BBC version, I knew how many scenes had to go, before I could finally leave the cinema. Mr Darcy whoever he is in this movie, definitely can't act. He looks also too young to play Mr Darcy. Every word that comes out of his mouth is rushed like he needs to get through the script or something. Where is the build up? At first, he seems confused with everything. He is just bizarre! It all looks put on.Was trying not to compare to the Colin Firth version but if you love that version, you will most likely be disappointed anyway.The costumes are absolutely shocking. Where are the corsets? I know Elizabeth is poor, but I think she still knows how to dress as some sort of ladylike fashion, and hasn't been brought up in a squaller. Her dresses indicates she might be the poorest peasant in all of England walking around in nothing more than brown rags. Is that what Jane Austen had in mind?I didn't agree with a couple of scenes in the movie in the fact, that I don't think it would be considered proper in that society for men to do such things, i.e for Darcy to walk in (without knocking on the front door - I might add) - in the middle of the night to see Elizabeth and give her a letter??? If he was a gentleman, very unlikely. Secondly, Mr Bingley just walking into Jane's room while she is sick to see if she is okay? Doesn't he have any sense of propriety? Mr Bingley who has wealth and hopefully sense should know better.There is some things that are said that sound too modern for the period this movie is set in, and not at all like Jane Austen. Bingley's character is shockingly done, to me he behaves like a simpleton, not a character to like and respect. Mr Bingley to me was always suppose to be likeable. To me, he is on the same lineage that we would view Mr Collins. What about that laugh of his!!! Wickham hardly has a presence so you don't get to feel at all for the lead up to Lydia taking off with him and Mr & Mrs Hurst and a couple of other characters have no presence at all. Everything feels in sequence but not a smooth flow - feels very jumpy.Didn't see or feel the chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy.Okay I am a fan of the other but was willing to give this a go and knew there would be differences. I guess my biggest disappointment is the portrayal of Darcy and Bingley. Bingley and Jane seemed like a bizarre couple to be getting attached. I didn't think the way they portrayed Bingley would be the type of person that the Jane they portrayed would go for. Again - chemistry?? Questionable.The ending - where is it??

I don't know how anyone could form an attachment to someone who did not have any redeeming qualities.  I know that they cast the Americans for the American audience but I also didn't like the casting of Sutherland.  His 5-day stubble annoyed me, as did his American accent during part of the film.

640851,A7NRL3R5C0AL4,B00005JOHI,"Maeri ""Marysz""","[10, 13]","Maybe every generation needs to re-invent Jane Austen for themselves. This  film interpretation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" stresses the youthfulness of the characters. Elizabeth and Darcy look younger here than they were in the most recent dramatization that featured Colin Firth. I loved the rough and tumble look of the Bennett's home. It's a non-prissy look at life in the early 19th century. The film's expansive outdoor scenes were like a series of Bruegel paintings--the characters' romances became part of larger ongoing drama of rural life. McFayden's Darcy is refreshingly nerdy. He's a nice change from the usual drop-dead handsome Darcys (like Laurence Olivier and Firth). Knightly is equally refreshing as a tomboyish Elizabeth.This is the story of two intelligent young people cursed with embarrassing relatives. Elizabeth has an emotionally disengaged father, a vulgar mother who continuously puts her foot in her mouth and three out-of-control sisters. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine, is an ill-behaved snob whose rude behavior is worse than the whole Bennett family put together.This film really conveys the precariousness of the Bennett's financial and social situation more than other dramatizations. We can see why Mrs. Bennett's desperation to get her daughters married off isn't so crazy after all. As in all of Austen, there's a dark undertone to the story--the vulnerability of women who have no money or powerful social connections.

But this adaptation `Pride & Prejudice' is wonderfully done. This movie has great casting, good writing and good direction. I did enjoy watching this shorten version of the film even though some subplots do not even exits in this movie. It would be impossible to place all that Jane Austen has going on in her novel into two-hour movie.One thing the director did do is film everything from the view of Elizabeth Bennet, played by Keira Knightly. And the dance hall scenes and social etiquette were accurate for the time period chosen, 1797. You could see what a middle-upper class family had to go through if they had daughters. I also thought that Matthew Macfadyen played a captivating Mr. Darcy and Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet, though looking soft spoken and soft on Elizabeth, and it showed he did marry for love.The scenery and music are highlights of the movie. This is a movie many will see more then once. Though Elizabeth Bennet in this movie seems to have more modern sensibilities then the book gives her, Keira knightly still does well. Especially considering every woman that has ever read this books has her own view on the character. But the chemistry you feel from the screen form Elizabeth and Darcy jumps out at you, there string love suppressed by misunderstandings and preconceived notions.... if I might be so bold as to say, their Pride & Prejudice.This book is a masterpiece and sets the standard for all romantic novels, so no movie could ever stand up to its standard.

The picture looks absolutely gorgeous: crisp and clear, with subtle yet rich colors. Pause at any point during the movie and you have a beautiful still on your screen. I don't currently have a set-up that takes advantage of the 5.1 audio mix, but it sounds just fine coming out of my tv speakers.Alas, to get to the movie, one must first navigate the horrendous BD Live system. Not content to stack trailer upon trailer onto a disc, the movie studios now force download a ""fresh"" trailer every time the movie plays. Skipping it is not an option. The disc allows no interaction until the trailer is downloaded, and even then, exiting the trailer is a nightmare: FF, SCAN, and NEXT are all disabled. If you don't give up easily you can eventually kill it (continuous pressing of ""POP UP MENU"" is one way), but that's two minutes of your life gone EVERY TIME you start the disc.Once you make it to the menu, prepare to be horrified. Thanks to BD Live there is a movie ticker along the upper right of the screen. Mercifully, this steady stream of marketing can be turned off, but the studios' desire to turn a simple menu into a perpetual commercial is enough to make me abandon Blu-Ray for DVD. The horror doesn't end there. Despite the Jane Austen pedigree, the menu designer opted instead to go with a slick, futuristic interface that looks better suited toFast & Furious, not Ms. Bennet & Mr. Darcy. The DVD release - actually, even the movie website from 2005 - did a better job with the menu.There's a lot to be annoyed at, but at the end of the day, the Blu-Ray treatment of the movie itself is absolutely marvelous, so if you're a fan and you find it on sale, it's worth picking up.

Hollywood made this a chick flick for the masses rather than a deep and hilarious jab at the ridiculous happenings in a society bound by precise codes of conduct. In addition, Austen, in Pride and Prejudice, was making gentle fun of the unbelievable amount of time people spent on making matches, thinking of marriage, and what people look for in a marriage partner. All of that is lost in this silly version.I don't think any of the cast is true to form--no one captures their character and so we are left with yet another flat romance that is meant to coo at you rather than shake you up with its pointed statement.

640867,A129YBX5BVNW2,B00005JOHI,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[4, 4]","*** REVIEW FOR THE 2010 BLU RAY VERSION ***In order to have this movie in High Definition, I've had the HD-DVD format of it for a few years now - but it's an America issue and has the controversially modern US ending. Now at last it arrives on BLU RAY in the USA (January 2010) and in the UK (May 2010) and it's just as gorgeous a transfer. It uses exactly the same elements that the HD-DVD did - even the same menus - and the extras from the DVD are all intact also (with the US ending tagged on as an Alternate).The improvement in picture quality is immense over the rather blurred DVD experience. As it opens with a misty dawn and the twitter of birds, we see the young and feisty Elizabeth Bennet (played with a magical touch and staggering assurance by Kiera Knightly) walking with a book. But it's not until she crosses the courtyard of her home that the real quality kicks in - and it's a wow. The picture takes you aback - it wasn't this good in the cinema I can tell you...It isn't perfect throughout by any means though. Because they were going for authenticity, a lot of the early evening and dark night sequences are shot in candlelit rooms (as they would have lived), so you get fuzziness in the definition... But once you get out into the countryside or inside one of the great halls of stately homes - where proper lighting prevailed - the picture quality is beautiful. There is one famous dream sequence where only Kiera's closed eyes fill the screen - she is dreaming of standing on the cliff edge - the clarity is gobsmacking. You also notice the weave of the clothing, the dirt on the hemlines, the ever so slightly unkempt hair - the attention to detail is great.Directed by Joe Wright and released in late 2005, the film version was living in the shadow of the legendary 6-part BBC production from 1995 - so the movie had a lot on its shoulders and admirably rose to the task. Another trump card was Dario Marianelli's lush piano score (Oscar nominated) swirling around the scenes like a graceful swan.In the cinema, it was a delight to look and experience - but sitting at home and watching it in real definition is a far more rewarding and illuminating experience. The acting chops on display is right across the board and apart from a slightly jarring ending, it had the hallmarks of a shoot that was fun and supremely confident in its delivery. I know others will cite the BBC production as definitive - but I think there's more than enough room on my shelf for both.Matthew MacFadyen, Brenda Blethyn, Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan, Judy Dench, Tom Hollander - they were a cleverly chosen cast - and Rupert Friend won the heart of the lovely Kiera (which might explain the ethereal beauty of her performance). But it's the stunning adaptation of Jane Austen's novel by DEBORAH MOGGACH that is the real hero of the day. There is a sequence when Elizabeth and Darcy finally face off against each other in the rain - the dialogue is to die for - and should have been Oscar rewarded. As a dabbler in screenplays myself, I can't stress enough just how good the work here is - dazzling stuff.It's under a tenner, the DVD extras are all intact, the picture quality is much improved and in some cases unbelievably so - and its eminently re-watchable.To sum up - if you're a fan of the film, Jane Austen or both - then you must own ""Pride & Prejudice"" on this format. A Blu Ray gem and highly recommended.",5,"""...So This Is Your Opinion Of Me...""",1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,3421,"['***', 'REVIEW', 'THE', '2010', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'VERSION', '***In', 'order', 'have', 'movie', 'High', 'Definition', ""'ve"", 'had', 'HD-DVD', 'format', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'America', 'issue', 'controversially', 'modern', 'US', 'ending', 'Now', 'last', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'USA', 'January', '2010', 'UK', 'May', '2010', 'just', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'transfer', 'exactly', 'same', 'elements', 'HD-DVD', 'did', 'even', 'same', 'menus', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'intact', 'also', 'US', 'ending', 'tagged', 'Alternate', '.The', 'improvement', 'picture', 'quality', 'immense', 'rather', 'blurred', 'DVD', 'experience', 'misty', 'dawn', 'twitter', 'birds', 'see', 'young', 'feisty', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'played', 'magical', 'touch', 'staggering', 'assurance', 'Kiera', 'Knightly', 'walking', 'book', 'not', 'courtyard', 'home', 'real', 'quality', 'kicks', 'wow', 'picture', 'aback', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'cinema', 'can', 'tell', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'means', 'were', 'going', 'authenticity', 'lot', 'early', 'evening', 'dark', 'night', 'sequences', 'are', 'shot', 'candlelit', 'rooms', 'would', 'have', 'lived', 'so', 'get', 'fuzziness', 'definition', 'once', 'get', 'out', 'countryside', 'one', 'great', 'halls', 'stately', 'homes', 'where', 'proper', 'lighting', 'prevailed', 'picture', 'quality', 'beautiful', 'one', 'famous', 'dream', 'sequence', 'where', 'only', 'Kiera', 'closed', 'eyes', 'fill', 'screen', 'dreaming', 'standing', 'cliff', 'edge', 'clarity', 'gobsmacking', 'also', 'notice', 'weave', 'clothing', 'dirt', 'hemlines', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'unkempt', 'hair', 'attention', 'detail', 'great.Directed', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'released', 'late', '2005', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'living', 'shadow', 'legendary', '6-part', 'BBC', 'production', '1995', 'movie', 'had', 'lot', 'shoulders', 'admirably', 'rose', 'task', 'trump', 'card', 'was', 'Dario', 'Marianelli', 'lush', 'piano', 'score', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'swirling', 'scenes', 'graceful', 'swan.In', 'cinema', 'was', 'delight', 'look', 'experience', 'sitting', 'home', 'watching', 'real', 'definition', 'far', 'more', 'rewarding', 'illuminating', 'experience', 'acting', 'chops', 'display', 'right', 'board', 'apart', 'slightly', 'jarring', 'ending', 'had', 'hallmarks', 'shoot', 'was', 'fun', 'supremely', 'confident', 'delivery', 'know', 'others', 'will', 'cite', 'BBC', 'production', 'definitive', 'think', 'more', 'enough', 'room', 'shelf', 'both.Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'were', 'cleverly', 'chosen', 'cast', 'Rupert', 'Friend', 'won', 'heart', 'lovely', 'Kiera', 'might', 'explain', 'ethereal', 'beauty', 'performance', 'stunning', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'DEBORAH', 'MOGGACH', 'real', 'hero', 'day', 'sequence', 'when', 'Elizabeth', 'Darcy', 'finally', 'face', 'off', 'other', 'rain', 'dialogue', 'die', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Oscar', 'rewarded', 'dabbler', 'screenplays', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stress', 'enough', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'work', 'here', 'dazzling', 'stuff.It', 'tenner', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'intact', 'picture', 'quality', 'much', 'improved', 'cases', 'unbelievably', 'eminently', 're-watchable.To', 'sum', ""'re"", 'fan', 'film', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'then', 'must', 'own', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'format', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'gem', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

It really does a nice job of not going too far over two hours, because with certain movies that don't move as quickly as others, it is very difficult to sit through them when they are too long.  The acting is very wonderful in this, but I am disappointed that the Academy did not consider Donald Sutherland for the supporting actor category instead of maybe Paul Giamatti.  I like Paul Giamatti, but I have a feeling that the Academy wanted to make up for not nominating him for his better role last year in Sideways.  Sutherland does not have many fiery scenes, but his mild manners and his modesty in this film just made me very excited to watch him in this role.  The rest of the acting is pretty good for this remake.  Kiera Knightley does not extremely impress me in this, at least as much as in Domino, but her acting suffices for this.  I shouldn't expect to see her accepting the Academy Award for Best Actress, but we should see her cheer Reese Witherspoon on.  The story is fantastic, and if you enjoy Jane Austen, then you will no doubt love this remake of one of the most popular novels in English Literature.  Very well done.

640870,A3ODENXA668OR,B00005JOHI,Markus Rexon,"[0, 0]","After watching this movie, I'll have to admit that it was pretty good: the acting was done well, the camera quality and shooting were quite good, the character's dress and the sets really matched into there respective time period nicely. These qualities would have made it an excellent movie if it weren't for a few problems. I know that it may seem a little nick-picky, but I think that these are real problems that [most of them] could have been dealt with.The first problem is the actors. I think that the acting itself was done perfectly, great enough to make any director proud; but the main problems are with the actors themselves. Some of them look a little too ""modern"": for example, I though that Keira Knightley looked a little too modern-aged for that time. She has a slight hint of a model look that fits perfectly into movies about our day an age. But that really doesn't work in a movie set in the late 18th century. Sure, Keira played her character well, but she didn't really have the look for that time period. Some of the other actors look a little ""goofy"", like Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland), Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), Lydia Bennet (Jena Malone), and Colonel Fitzwilliam (Cornelius Booth),  kind of look out-of-place in the movie setting. In the A&A; production, they had gotten actors that fit the roles and looks of the characters. And here, they get allot of them right, but some of them really aren't looking too good.Another problem is that sometimes, especially when the characters are in the streets of a town of inside a busy room, the dialogue and the background sound of the surrounding activity seem to clash a little bit. Sometimes, when the characters are having a quitter discussion in a more active place, the sounds of the hustle and bustle around them are allot louder than the characters, making it hard to hear them at several points. There will be several times were you will have to keep on adjusting your TV's volume so that you can hear the dialogue clearly. I think that this is a problem that could easily have been fixed before release via a small sound adjustment.And perhaps the biggest problem with the film is this: it's too short. I know that it is two hours long, but I'm not talking about the running length itself. Allow me to explain:Pride and Prejudice is a long book: even with the A&E; production, which was six hours long, several scenes from the book had to be cut out. But they still had enough time to have several smaller events that didn't have much to do with the main plot but didn't take away from the story at all: in fact, I think that those smaller scenes really benefited the whole production immensely. It was easier to connect and care for the characters if you saw more involved with there personal lives that just what you see in the main plot. I know that the makers of this film didn't have six hours to include that many side-scenes from the book, but it still feels a little ""tight"": pretty much just the main plot from the original story is included here, and even on that they really had to trim it. It just sort of feels in this movie like were zipping from one event to another: one moment the Netherfield Ball is just ending, then before you know it Mr. Collins comes in. There really isn't much time to contemplate on any one event: just as soon as one important even happens, another important one pops up. For example: I didn't think that they gave enough time to the whole Lydia running off with Wickham. That is a very important event in the story. But it seems like, almost as soon as they run off, they're found and brought back. There's no time to realize the seriousness of the situation if it all happens in ten minutes. There are other stuff like this in the movie that didn't get enough time: there wasn't enough time given to the character development of Mr. Darcy's younger sister, Elizabeth's visit to her Aunt and Uncle was too short, and perhaps the biggest hurtle of them all, several memorable characters, like Mrs. Hurst and Sir William Lucas  have been ultimately cut from the film for the sake of time. I know that you can't really blame the makers for these things: they didn't have six-hours to make a theatrical movie like A&E; did. But this still raises a question: does Pride and Prejudice really work out as a two-hour movie? This is still a really good film, I'll have to say; but this problem really prevents it from becoming a brilliant, plain-out really great film. But I know that this is a problem that couldn't really been helped, so I can't really hold it againsed the movie that much.Despite these problems, this still a good film that is really worth watching: even though it may have a few ""casting errors"" and some sound problems, and that it may feel a little rushed, but it's still a great film that deserves attention. It may not benefit your film collection as much as the A&E; production will, but it's still a film that is sure to be enjoyed.",3,"Good movie, but it could have been better",1392076800,"02 11,

This film has filled in the story's background with great depth and color, taking us into a real English country dance, with all of its raucous energy. We see into people's homes with their daily activities, tasks, and yes, even the messes. The dialog feels like conversations that are face to face, not speeches posed across a giant stage. The overall result is a greater feeling of intimacy between you and the movie, almost as if it's not seen on screen but through a window... or even a mirror. I must have seen a dozen or more adaptations of this immortal story, but this time I felt like I was there, and a part of it all.As for the acting, I thought Matthew Macfadyen was the best Darcy I have ever seen. All of the actors were excellent, but I want to make special mention of Talulah Riley's performance as the bookish sister, Mary.  Most adaptations seem to disregard or even ridicule Mary for her social cluelessness. But this movie is brave enough to let us see her in greater depth and compassion, as a girl whose cluelessness is really just an extreme awkwardness, and therefore something we can all relate to. We even see her beauty and vulnerability as I have never seen on screen. In a master stroke of screenwriting, we see her suffer great pain and shame after her embarrassing attempt to be socially adept by performing at the pianoforte, albeit badly, to be publicly humiliated by her mother's loud declaration that ""You have delighted us long enough"" and her crumbling defeat from it. It is then that we see Mr. Bennet in a rare moment of warmth, comforting his disconsolate little girl, not aloof and sarcastic as usual, but holding her in his arms.  In this way, too, it breathed more life into the story in all of its fullness.That, for me, made this movie feel like the story was finally a part of myself, not just a tale about others.",5,Not just the story but the age,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,2032,"['Adaptations', 'masterpiece', 'have', 'always', 'seemed', 'idealize', 'period', 'everyone', 'always', 'perfectly', 'coiffed', 'nothing', 'ever', 'place', 'even', 'dusty', 'film', 'filled', 'story', 'background', 'great', 'depth', 'color', 'taking', 'real', 'English', 'country', 'dance', 'raucous', 'energy', 'see', 'people', 'homes', 'daily', 'activities', 'tasks', 'yes', 'even', 'messes', 'dialog', 'feels', 'conversations', 'are', 'face', 'face', 'not', 'speeches', 'posed', 'giant', 'stage', 'overall', 'result', 'greater', 'feeling', 'intimacy', 'movie', 'almost', 'not', 'seen', 'screen', 'window', 'even', 'mirror', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'dozen', 'more', 'adaptations', 'immortal', 'story', 'time', 'felt', 'was', 'there', 'part', 'acting', 'thought', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'was', 'best', 'Darcy', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'actors', 'were', 'excellent', 'want', 'make', 'special', 'mention', 'Talulah', 'Riley', 'performance', 'bookish', 'sister', 'Mary', 'Most', 'adaptations', 'seem', 'disregard', 'even', 'ridicule', 'Mary', 'social', 'cluelessness', 'movie', 'brave', 'enough', 'let', 'see', 'greater', 'depth', 'compassion', 'girl', 'cluelessness', 'really', 'just', 'extreme', 'awkwardness', 'therefore', 'something', 'can', 'relate', 'even', 'see', 'beauty', 'vulnerability', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'screen', 'master', 'stroke', 'screenwriting', 'see', 'suffer', 'great', 'pain', 'shame', 'embarrassing', 'attempt', 'be', 'socially', 'adept', 'performing', 'pianoforte', 'albeit', 'badly', 'be', 'publicly', 'humiliated', 'mother', 'loud', 'declaration', 'have', 'delighted', 'long', 'enough', 'crumbling', 'defeat', 'then', 'see', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'rare', 'moment', 'warmth', 'comforting', 'disconsolate', 'little', 'girl', 'not', 'aloof', 'sarcastic', 'usual', 'holding', 'arms', 'way', 'too', 'breathed', 'more', 'life', 'story', 'fullness.That', 'made', 'movie', 'feel', 'story', 'was', 'finally', 'part', 'myself', 'not', 'just', 'tale', 'others']",N/A

I didn't know who Jane Austen was, but I risked disappointment and tried a ""new"" author. Truth to be told, I found a book that became one of my favourites, due to the fact that it is well-written, but also thoroughly entertaining.I must say that I was a little afraid to watch this movie, due to the undeniable fact that literary adaptations can sometimes go sour. Thankfully, that isn't the case in this occasion, because the director, Joe Wright, somehow managed to capture the essence of the book. I suppose the excellent cast must have helped him in that endeavour. All the actors are remarkably good, but some are specially noteworthy. I think I should at least mention Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet, Matthew Macfadyen as the handsome Mr. Darcy, and Brenda Blethyn as the kind of mother you are thankful not to have :)The plot is not overly complicated, and it tackles wonderfully themes such as relationships, love, class distinctions, and of course pride and prejudice, all from the point of view of what happened in 18th century England. The story begins in the small town where the Bennets live. Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) has five daughters, and her mission in life is marrying them off. Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) is an intellectual, who often escapes to his library in search of silence and to avoid Mrs. Bennet's nonsense. The two more important daughters, from the point of view of the story, are probably the eldest, the beautiful Jane (Rosamund Pike) and the second, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) who is very witty but perhaps too proud.The dynamics of the town are changed when a single man of large fortune, Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), arrives to Netherfield Park, an estate not far from town. Mr. Bingley comes with a friend, Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), and the Bennets meet both at a ball. While Mr. Bingley immediately caughts Jane's eye, and is considered nice by Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy has not such luck. By sheer chance, Elizabeth overhears him making a negative comment on her, something that hurts her pride and spurs her to consider him a hateful man. But will that change? And if so, how?Discovering that is likely to be fun for the spectator, unless he is a perfectionist looking for inconsistencies between the film and the book. There are quite a few, it is true, but I firmly believe that is not important if the essence of what makes ""Pride and Prejudice"" a classic is present in the movie. And in my opinion, it is... Highly recommended :)Belen AlcatPS: Of course, if you want to enjoy this film even more, read the book too.

640881,AFJCOP0GKZH6C,B00005JOHI,M. B. Trapp,"[5, 10]","I've never read anything by Jane Austen, and I suspect I never will. Thus I have no idea whether Joe Wright's version of Pride and Prejudice is an accurate translation of the novel to film. But I do know that it's one of the best films my wife and I have watched together in a long time. The film was like a breath of fresh air to me; I found something almost shocking about the culture of love and marriage the film depicts. As I watched the movie, I couldn't refrain from contrasting the drama of Victorian courtship with the oversexed, hypersensual culture of ""courtship"" (so-called) that characterizes today's young people.As for the merits of the film itself, Wright does a fantastic job of whittling down Austen's apparently complicated plot into a coherent narrative. The cinematography is striking as well. When the movie opened up with a slow, Malick-esque reveal of a sunrise over a stand of trees, I immediately knew there was something special going on. There is one shot at a ball where the camera goes from room to room, picking up conversations and characters as they move about, backtracking and picking them up again as they socialize and dramatize. I didn't count, but I think the shot was at least six to eight minutes long. This is a very difficult shot to accomplish, as multiple actors have to hit their lines and their positions in a very crowded area right on time, and if someone flubs their part, that's an eight-minute take that just went down the drain. This kind of shot is the mark of a patient and creative filmmaker.The largely British cast is also phenomenal. I usually consider Keira Knightley to be the queen of overacting, but here her personality is perfect for Lizzie Bennett. I've never heard of the actor playing Mr. Darcy, but I instantly knew I wanted to see him in other films. He has a weighty screen presence about him that's a joy to watch. My wife immediately declared Pride and Prejudice to be one of her favorite movies of all time, and as for love stories, I'd have to agree. It's not only good entertainment, it showcases a picture of love and romance that all young people would benefit from seeing, especially girls. We'll be showing it to our daughter when she enters the dating world as a counterbalance to the false messages about love and romance the world gives her.",5,An instant classic love story,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,2324,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'anything', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'suspect', 'never', 'will', 'Thus', 'have', 'idea', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'accurate', 'translation', 'novel', 'film', 'do', 'know', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'wife', 'have', 'watched', 'together', 'long', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'found', 'something', 'almost', 'shocking', 'culture', 'love', 'marriage', 'film', 'depicts', 'watched', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'refrain', 'contrasting', 'drama', 'Victorian', 'courtship', 'oversexed', 'hypersensual', 'culture', 'courtship', 'so-called', 'today', 'young', 'people.As', 'merits', 'film', 'Wright', 'fantastic', 'job', 'whittling', 'down', 'Austen', 'apparently', 'complicated', 'plot', 'coherent', 'narrative', 'cinematography', 'striking', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'movie', 'opened', 'up', 'slow', 'Malick-esque', 'reveal', 'sunrise', 'stand', 'trees', 'immediately', 'knew', 'was', 'something', 'special', 'going', 'one', 'shot', 'ball', 'where', 'camera', 'room', 'room', 'picking', 'up', 'conversations', 'characters', 'move', 'backtracking', 'picking', 'up', 'again', 'socialize', 'dramatize', 'did', ""n't"", 'count', 'think', 'shot', 'was', 'least', 'six', 'eight', 'minutes', 'long', 'very', 'difficult', 'shot', 'accomplish', 'multiple', 'actors', 'have', 'hit', 'lines', 'positions', 'very', 'crowded', 'area', 'right', 'time', 'someone', 'flubs', 'part', 'eight-minute', 'take', 'just', 'went', 'drain', 'kind', 'shot', 'mark', 'patient', 'creative', 'filmmaker.The', 'largely', 'British', 'cast', 'also', 'phenomenal', 'usually', 'consider', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'be', 'queen', 'overacting', 'here', 'personality', 'perfect', 'Lizzie', 'Bennett', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'actor', 'playing', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'instantly', 'knew', 'wanted', 'see', 'other', 'films', 'weighty', 'screen', 'presence', 'joy', 'watch', 'My', 'wife', 'immediately', 'declared', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'love', 'stories', ""'d"", 'have', 'agree', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'entertainment', 'picture', 'love', 'romance', 'young', 'people', 'would', 'benefit', 'seeing', 'especially', 'girls', ""'ll"", 'be', 'showing', 'daughter', 'when', 'dating', 'world', 'counterbalance', 'false', 'messages', 'love', 'romance', 'world']",N/A

I thoroughly enjoyed the film and strongly feel it stood up quite well to the much-lauded 1995 BBC mini-series, even though it seems patently unfair to use another film version (which contained its own fair share of casting mistakes and flaws) as the benchmark to judge another.First, Keira Knightley gives a remarkably convincing performance (reflected by the fact that she received well-deserved Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for this role) as the ""not yet 21 [years old]"" Elizabeth Bennet.  Knightley was not only physically suited to play the part of Elizabeth, but she absolutely managed to capture some the spirit/petulance that is as much a part of the personality of the Austen heroine as the sharp intelligence and wit that traditionally characterizes Lizzie.  Knightley particularly shines in the well-directed rainy scene in which she lambastes Mr. Darcy, following his reluctant marriage proposal to her; Knightley is articulate and passionate in the scene and clearly demonstrates she is not only a photogenic presence on-screen, but has the chops for acting, as well.I was initially ambivalent about Matthew Macfayden's portrayal of Mr. Darcy, but after watching the movie a second time, I found Macfayden's interpretation of the character to be fresh and compelling. Macfayden's distant, slightly awkward Darcy works well opposite Knightley's fiery Lizzie.  The mutual attraction between the two characters is palpable, but clearly hampered by their strong personalities and the proper decorum dictated by the period.I particularly enjoyed the glimpse into early 19th Century life in rural England that this movie provided.  In other film interpretations of Austen's classic novel, the Bennets lived on a lavish (and hence somewhat unlikely), extremely formal and upscale style, which quite frankly, did not seem consistent with the family's alleged circumstances and situation.  In this particular film version, all of the Bennet girls looked lovely (for instance) when turned out in style (with curled hair and fresh frocks) to attend the ball at Netherfield; however, when the viewer is permitted a peek into everyday life in the Bennet household, the house itself is not only rather topsy-turvy, the Bennet sisters themselves are slightly disheveled--their clothes are suited for doing light housework and their hairstyles are mussed and flyaway as would be suited to the quiet and unpretentious lives they lead in the country.The supporting cast is excellent; standouts would include: Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet; Dame Judi Dench as the formidable Lady Catherine de Bourg; and Rosamund Pike who plays, as well as looks the part of Jane Bennet.  This movie version of the much-loved Austen classic stands well on it own merits and does not disappoint; it is beautifully filmed on location in various parts of England and is definitely well worth seeing.",5,An Intelligent and Romantic Film,1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,3002,"['must', 'admit', 'was', 'stunned', 'read', 'various', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'strongly', 'feel', 'stood', 'up', 'quite', 'well', 'much-lauded', '1995', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'even', 'patently', 'unfair', 'use', 'film', 'version', 'contained', 'own', 'fair', 'share', 'casting', 'mistakes', 'flaws', 'benchmark', 'judge', 'another.First', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'remarkably', 'convincing', 'performance', 'reflected', 'fact', 'received', 'well-deserved', 'Oscar', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nominations', 'role', 'not', 'yet', '21', '[', 'years', 'old', ']', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Knightley', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'physically', 'suited', 'play', 'part', 'Elizabeth', 'absolutely', 'managed', 'capture', 'spirit/petulance', 'as', 'much', 'part', 'personality', 'Austen', 'heroine', 'sharp', 'intelligence', 'wit', 'traditionally', 'Lizzie', 'Knightley', 'particularly', 'shines', 'well-directed', 'rainy', 'scene', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'following', 'reluctant', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'Knightley', 'articulate', 'passionate', 'scene', 'clearly', 'not', 'only', 'photogenic', 'presence', 'on-screen', 'chops', 'acting', 'well.I', 'was', 'initially', 'ambivalent', 'Matthew', 'Macfayden', 'portrayal', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'watching', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'found', 'Macfayden', 'interpretation', 'character', 'be', 'fresh', 'compelling', 'Macfayden', 'distant', 'slightly', 'awkward', 'Darcy', 'well', 'opposite', 'Knightley', 'fiery', 'Lizzie', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'two', 'characters', 'palpable', 'clearly', 'hampered', 'strong', 'personalities', 'proper', 'decorum', 'dictated', 'period.I', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'glimpse', 'early', '19th', 'Century', 'life', 'rural', 'England', 'movie', 'provided', 'other', 'film', 'interpretations', 'Austen', 'classic', 'novel', 'Bennets', 'lived', 'lavish', 'hence', 'somewhat', 'unlikely', 'extremely', 'formal', 'upscale', 'style', 'quite', 'frankly', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'consistent', 'family', 'alleged', 'circumstances', 'situation', 'particular', 'film', 'version', 'Bennet', 'girls', 'looked', 'lovely', 'instance', 'when', 'turned', 'out', 'style', 'curled', 'hair', 'fresh', 'frocks', 'attend', 'ball', 'Netherfield', 'however', 'when', 'viewer', 'permitted', 'peek', 'everyday', 'life', 'Bennet', 'household', 'house', 'not', 'only', 'rather', 'topsy-turvy', 'Bennet', 'sisters', 'are', 'slightly', 'disheveled', 'clothes', 'are', 'suited', 'doing', 'light', 'housework', 'hairstyles', 'are', 'mussed', 'flyaway', 'would', 'be', 'suited', 'quiet', 'unpretentious', 'lives', 'lead', 'country.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'standouts', 'would', 'include', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'formidable', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourg', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'who', 'as', 'well', 'part', 'Jane', 'Bennet', 'movie', 'version', 'much-loved', 'Austen', 'classic', 'well', 'own', 'merits', 'not', 'disappoint', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'location', 'various', 'parts', 'England', 'definitely', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

So why the hell not?Firstly I was pleasantly surprised. After my disastrous attempts at watching some 'period' movies recently (Emma, Vanity Fair), I was preparing myself not to like this. A girl I work with, who also watched and detested Vanity Fair, also didn't enjoy this. But then I was being told by every customer buying it that they liked it.It took me a while, but I did eventually get around to watching it, although was disappointed to discover there was no trailer on the DVD. Plenty of other extras however.For some reason, Keira Knightley got an Oscar nomination for this (but lost out to Reese Witherspoon), which, upon watching the film, I didn't get, considering she mumbles most of her lines. I had to actually have the subtitles switched on to understand not only her, but the fancy olde English that was used. I had the sound turned right up, but still couldn't make much sense of it.But overall, the film was very good, even Keira! Jenna Malone doesn't get much of a look in, her 'big' part being that she elopes. (Not the done thing in those days.) It's good to see Keira actually smiling for a change, she rarely does. There's plenty of great scenery to detract your attention from the not-so-cute guys appearing on screen. I was really disappointed with the lack of good looking guys in this film. Why? You have Keira, Rosamund Pike, Jenna Malone & Brenda Blethyn, don't the girls need some eye candy?I can't really comment much on this, as it was average, perhaps reading the book, and seeing the previous versions might enlighten me a bit. It's understandable that for Keira and Matthew MacFadyen, it must have been difficult for them to step into their predecessors shoes, particularly the much-loved shoes of Colin Firth.There's an alternate ending, where Mr Darcy and Lizzie kiss, but it brings nothing to the film, except it was aimed at the US audiences.

640887,A2OIG88PG8K4M3,B00005JOHI,"Megan Stoner ""film and book aficionado""","[319, 342]","When I heard that there was a new version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" to be made, I was far from pleased. In fact, I was fairly annoyed: A&E;'s version with Colin Firth has been a staple of my DVD collection for an incredibly long time, and I couldn't imagine anyone tampering with perfection. Why mess with genius?Happily, I was wrong in my estimation of the movie. Perhaps it's only appropriate, given the subject matter: the whole story of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is wrapped up in wrong estimations of character, miscommunications, and partial understandings. The Focus Features version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is more of a classic Romance, set earlier in period and filmed against more stunning backdrops than the A&E; version: there were no grand cliffs or windswept heaths in that one, but they work here.The performances are universally excellent: I was appropriately annoyed by Brenda Blethyn's ludicrously inappropriate Mrs. Bennet, and Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourgh is one of the most delicious strokes of casting genius...ever. Donald Sutherland as the bemused patriarch Mr. Bennet holds his own in a largely British cast, and was suitably affectionately distracted in his fatherly role. Simon Woods is amiable and open-faced as Mr. Bingley, and properly deserves Rosamund Pike's delicate Jane.The movie belongs, however, to Matthew McFadyen and Keira Knightley, as it rightly should. The book, however involved its subplots, focused mainly on their sparring, and the film wisely excises a lot of the extraneous matter, tightening its focus and condensing some scenes. Matthew McFadyen is, possibly, an even better Mr. Darcy than Colin Firth (though that pains me to say): his Darcy is sensitive, prone to moodiness and shows of the Stiff Upper Lip, but his eyes don't always manage to keep up the mask, and it is this that makes him amazing. When his eyes do light up, it is stunning, because we have learned not to expect it. He positively smolders with passion, even soaking wet with pleading in his eyes. Or perhaps especially soaking wet. In any case, he smolders. Bosoms will heave, corsets or not, when he's onscreen.Watching Keira Knightley as Lizzie Bennet I was irresistibly reminded of another fiercely intelligent, wide-eyed brunette bookworm: Winona Ryder's Jo March, in 1994's exquisite ""Little Women."" Knightley conveys the same compelling blend of delicacy and strength as Ryder managed, no easy feat in this world of one-note romance, and one I wasn't sure she could manage, as I've never been a fan. Knightley does a good job, however: her Lizzie is a ""fearsome creature,"" to quote herself, both fiercely loyal and heartily passionate for life, yet always with just a trace of vulnerability; one wonders, at times, if her passionate demeanour isn't as much a disguise as Darcy's cool mask. Perhaps that is what makes their inevitable but much-delayed romance so alluring: here are two people who absolutely should be in love with each other, but manage to think themselves out of it for a very long time.The world of the film is more realistically rural than other adaptations: the ladies' hems are dirty, their dresses are frequently wrinkled, and pigs traipse through the Bennet house as often as visitors do. There are some lovely little touches to the filmmaking as well, such as one scene featuring a distracted Mr. Darcy being circled, predator-like, by Lizzie and the coolly condescending Caroline Bingley; one absolutely feels sorry for the man. I particularly liked the dancing scenes: there is always something going on with someone familiar in the corner of the frame, lending the scenes a pleasant intimacy that suits the material nicely.Ultimately, I love this story so much because its romantic heroes deserve one another, even though they do not always realize it. Theirs is a relationship built not only on passion - although in this version, even more so than the seminal A&E; version, it is decidedly present, particularly in a post-wedding scene at Pemberley featuring (sigh!) a barefoot Mr. Darcy - but on mutual interests and a hearty respect for one another. When Lizzie and Darcy finally marry (as we know they must, long before they do) it is, to steal from Shakespeare (and another Jane Austen movie) a ""marriage of true minds."" And after all, what could be more romantic than a smart, handsome man in a cravat and a long, windblown coat?",4,Charming and intelligent,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,4397,"['When', 'heard', 'was', 'new', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'be', 'made', 'was', 'far', 'pleased', 'fact', 'was', 'fairly', 'annoyed', 'E', 'version', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'been', 'staple', 'DVD', 'collection', 'incredibly', 'long', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'tampering', 'perfection', 'Why', 'mess', 'genius', 'Happily', 'was', 'wrong', 'estimation', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'appropriate', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'whole', 'story', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'wrapped', 'up', 'wrong', 'estimations', 'character', 'miscommunications', 'partial', 'understandings', 'Focus', 'Features', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'more', 'classic', 'Romance', 'set', 'earlier', 'period', 'filmed', 'more', 'stunning', 'backdrops', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'were', 'grand', 'cliffs', 'windswept', 'heaths', 'one', 'work', 'here.The', 'performances', 'are', 'universally', 'excellent', 'was', 'appropriately', 'annoyed', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'ludicrously', 'inappropriate', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourgh', 'one', 'most', 'delicious', 'strokes', 'casting', 'genius', 'ever', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'bemused', 'patriarch', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'own', 'largely', 'British', 'cast', 'was', 'suitably', 'affectionately', 'distracted', 'fatherly', 'role', 'Simon', 'Woods', 'amiable', 'open-faced', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'properly', 'deserves', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'delicate', 'Jane.The', 'movie', 'belongs', 'however', 'Matthew', 'McFadyen', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'rightly', 'should', 'book', 'however', 'involved', 'subplots', 'focused', 'mainly', 'sparring', 'film', 'wisely', 'lot', 'extraneous', 'matter', 'tightening', 'focus', 'condensing', 'scenes', 'Matthew', 'McFadyen', 'possibly', 'even', 'better', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'say', 'Darcy', 'sensitive', 'prone', 'moodiness', 'shows', 'Stiff', 'Upper', 'Lip', 'eyes', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'manage', 'keep', 'up', 'mask', 'amazing', 'When', 'eyes', 'do', 'light', 'up', 'stunning', 'have', 'learned', 'not', 'expect', 'positively', 'passion', 'even', 'soaking', 'wet', 'pleading', 'eyes', 'perhaps', 'especially', 'soaking', 'wet', 'case', 'Bosoms', 'will', 'heave', 'corsets', 'not', 'when', 'onscreen.Watching', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Lizzie', 'Bennet', 'was', 'irresistibly', 'reminded', 'fiercely', 'intelligent', 'wide-eyed', 'brunette', 'bookworm', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Jo', 'March', '1994', 'exquisite', 'Little', 'Women', 'Knightley', 'conveys', 'same', 'compelling', 'blend', 'delicacy', 'strength', 'Ryder', 'managed', 'easy', 'feat', 'world', 'one-note', 'romance', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'could', 'manage', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Knightley', 'good', 'job', 'however', 'Lizzie', 'fearsome', 'creature', 'quote', 'fiercely', 'loyal', 'heartily', 'passionate', 'life', 'always', 'just', 'trace', 'vulnerability', 'one', 'wonders', 'times', 'passionate', 'demeanour', ""n't"", 'as', 'much', 'disguise', 'Darcy', 'cool', 'mask', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'inevitable', 'much-delayed', 'romance', 'alluring', 'here', 'are', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'absolutely', 'should', 'be', 'love', 'other', 'manage', 'think', 'very', 'long', 'time.The', 'world', 'film', 'more', 'realistically', 'rural', 'other', 'adaptations', 'ladies', 'hems', 'are', 'dirty', 'dresses', 'are', 'frequently', 'wrinkled', 'pigs', 'traipse', 'Bennet', 'house', 'as', 'often', 'visitors', 'do', 'are', 'lovely', 'little', 'touches', 'filmmaking', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'one', 'scene', 'featuring', 'distracted', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'being', 'circled', 'predator-like', 'Lizzie', 'coolly', 'condescending', 'Caroline', 'Bingley', 'one', 'absolutely', 'sorry', 'man', 'particularly', 'liked', 'dancing', 'scenes', 'always', 'something', 'going', 'someone', 'familiar', 'corner', 'frame', 'lending', 'scenes', 'pleasant', 'intimacy', 'suits', 'material', 'nicely.Ultimately', 'love', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'romantic', 'heroes', 'deserve', 'one', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'realize', 'relationship', 'built', 'not', 'only', 'passion', 'version', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'seminal', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'decidedly', 'present', 'particularly', 'post-wedding', 'scene', 'Pemberley', 'featuring', 'sigh', 'barefoot', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'mutual', 'interests', 'hearty', 'respect', 'one', 'When', 'Lizzie', 'Darcy', 'finally', 'marry', 'know', 'must', 'long', 'do', 'steal', 'Shakespeare', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'movie', 'marriage', 'true', 'minds', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'romantic', 'smart', 'handsome', 'man', 'cravat', 'long', 'windblown', 'coat']",N/A

For example I liked Mr. Collins, Charlotte Lucas, and Mrs. Bennett better in this version, because I think the actors were able to bring empathy for previously one-dimensional characters. Now I won't pretend to compare the lead actors between versions, but I don't think anyone disgraced themselves.Yes there were some things about this movie that were historically inaccurate or not faithful to the book, but again, you cannot fit all the content of a book into a film.

640893,A2BHWOS5PUGU78,B00005JOHI,Mercy Bell,"[193, 215]","I saw an advanced screening of this film in Boston and was very pleased, it is intelligent in its handle of the material and its fluency in cinematic crafting. Goodbye to dusty, ""precious"" interpretations of Jane Austen. This cheeky, poetic, even dark new film makes the story youthful with down-to-earth vibrancy and worship of emotion. Here are young people making the mistakes and dreaming the dreams of the young (when it was written it wasn't antiquity, it was life). Lizzie is not a smirking omniscient but a quick witted independent; hotheaded and fiercely loyal to her sister. She is wary of an unfair world and uses her wits to survive. Darcy is not an impenetrable stoic but a shy sensitive soul with high unwieldy social pretensions fending off the outside world. And they are both lonely and have big yearning hearts, so the filmmakers made one great decision -- they let them fall in love the first moment they lock eyes. In a shot we see hearts behind fortified personalities and an instant chemistry that takes a movie's worth of battling with each other and themselves to right itself. It's an earthy move that sets the tone for a film about the people and world behind the antiquated manners, a world not so different from ours.Now set in 1797, when Austen wrote the first draft of the book, the filmmakers committed to main plot points and themes, and astutely represent the Romantic Age and Austen's characters.  The love between Jane and Lizzie is supreme and fuels a desire in Lizzie to tear at Darcy when he separates Jane from Mr. Bingley. She's hurt, she reciprocates the pain, and it is bitter.  Pride and prejudices are drawn clearly: Lizzie searches hard to find fault with Darcy, and Darcy cannot bring himself to let down his guard. Both have their reasons justified, but they foil their own chances at love constantly until they see how wrong they are and are too heartsick to keep going. Class conflict is suddenly personally injurious and vicious. When Charlotte Lucas marries for security, it's a grave matter and she must bitingly sober up a disdainful Lizzie on the realities of their world. The Bennets are too eccentric and improper for their own good. Lady Catherine (Dame Judi Dench, who is downright fearsome) is not just a cold figure for Lizzie to spar with, but someone capable of deeply hurting others. The filmmakers are savvy in their understanding of history. Setting it back 20 years is a remarkable move, because we accept more diversions and variation with the 18th century than the 19th and it presents Austen as a Romantic, which automatically requires the story to be interpreted from a different, very legitimate, perspective. The ideals of the Romantic Age are ingeniously, subtly played here: human equality, gritty realism married with beauty for the sake of beauty, but a beauty which is never elitist or decadent, always grounded, simple, and universal: nature, the human being, emotion.The ensemble and mis-en-scene are electric. The camera spryly edges in and out of rooms and conversations instead of sitting arthritically in a corner. The dance scenes are less about ballet, now rollicking and spirited as characters send signals, flirt, deflect and analyze one another. In true Romantic form (worthy of filling Wordsworth with pride) the aesthetic unabashedly revels in beauty, but always the simple joys of our world: sunrises, dewy landscapes in wide shots, colors everywhere. It has a lovely score, period inspired and without any pomp and circumastance. Simple blocking is caffeinated and given substance, something is always going on in the background. Lively, layered interactions between characters make rich scenes, neither wasting space nor time. Consider a scene with Mr. Collins, played by the magnificent Tom Hollander (a standout here, so delightfully weird. When he jaggedly squirms his way up to someone you want to shriek). He wants to speak to Lizzie, alone, and a bolt of fear strikes through her as she pleads in vain not to be abandoned. The sisters are merciless, Mrs. Bennet delighted, Mr. Bennet at a loss, and Collins prepares. It's all silent and it's hysterical.Suggesting variation to revered characters is a frightful task, but here it's a revelation. The entire cast is brilliant, but the two leads are transcendent in their roles. Keira Knightley is charismatic, random, wonderfully young, intuitive to the bone -- she inhabits Lizzie. Matt MacFadyen is deep, remarkably subtle, but mostly he is soulful. I've long held him as a sympathetic actor, but he shines in this.  The two instill an unexpected exuberance of feeling in their performances.  Neither ever acknowledge the camera exists and make the most of every second they have on screen to project their characters. When you throw them together you get a love story full of emotional subtext, double meaning, and gloriously heavy moments.Because so much dialogue was cut, simple lines have impact and much of the exposition is visual. Epic little moments linger and rain, revealing souls. The thoughts and intentions behind the actors' eyes and words are visible at all times.  This movie understands the power of a shot or glance. Lizzie comes to understand Darcy in how he embraces his sister or smiles (a momentous occasion, indeed). When she talks about love it's stirring because it's finally spilled into the open after we've seen it near the edge many times with half said sentiments and stifled tears. Usually ""I love you"" comes with extra explanatory prose, but here sincerity kills clich&eacute;: parties are fun, a misty field is breathtaking, the dawning of love a revelation, the heartbreak is throbbing.It's a brilliant film. There is something breathless and luminous about it, from its youth and the break from propriety, to the beauty and spontaneity of life and romance, pain and joy, which provide the color.",5,"Oft told

640896,A1YY9CAIF9RM2C,B00005JOHI,M. Hester,"[6, 15]","Like so many other people, I approached this film with trepidation because I dearly love the 1995 version and not just because of Colin Firth. Over the course of the months since this film's release, I'd heard vastly different reviews of the film and not inconsequential problems that Austen fans had with the movie. As I sat down to watch, I tried to forget what I'd heard, the 1995 version and tried to be as impartial as possible. However, it was very, very hard to forget the 1995 version.The good (the things that exceed the 1995 version):Rosamund Pike makes an excellent Jane. She's beautiful enough to fit the description of Jane being the most beautiful girl in Hertfordshire, something that Susannah Harker had been unable to do. She also gives some steel to a character that is frequently characterized as soft.The music is absolutely beautiful. It fits in so beautifully with the story. It rivals with Patrick Doyle's ""Sense and Sensibility"" soundtrack.The O.K. (things on par with the 1995 version)Brenda Blethyn gives a very different performance of Mrs. Bennett from the 1995 version. While wholly different, it is just as good and the character remains just as silly and endearing as ever.Simon Woods is a very good Mr. Bingley. He has the bumbling part down and clearly conveys his feelings for Jane. I particularly enjoy his work when his character says something rather off a nd must put it to rights.Judy Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourgh is wonderful casting. Dame Dench has played this role before and brings the same wonderful imperiousness.Tom Hollander, like Brenda Blethyn, was very different from his 1995 counterpart, but played the role of Mr. Collins admirably. I couldn't help but smile every time he came onto the screen  and laugh every time he mentioned Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Rosings, or made one of his funny little speeches.The Bad (the things that aren't as good as the 1995 version)The setting and costuming looked incredibly off. It seemed as if the people making this movie didn't realize that the Bennetts were pretty well off, as long as they had the estate, with 2,000 pounds a year. The overall appearance of everyone who was not a Bingley, Darcy, or de Bourgh left much to be desired.Keira Knightley is just not Elizabeth Bennett. Most of the movie she acted as if she knew she was remarkably clever, which didn't sit all that well.Matthew Macfadyen definitely does not fill Colin Firth's shoes. He lacks the ability to act with his eyes that helped Firth so much in the earlier version. He is too silent and dour for most of the movie and when he finally does perk up it is far too late.There is a lack of chemistry between the two leads which makes certain scenes like the first proposal scene seem entirely out of place. Any thoughts to attachment beforehand was created by the camera and not the 2 actors. Keira Knightley had more chemistry with Darcy's bust than Darcy himself.Jena Malone, Donald Sutherland, and Rupert Friend try admirably in their roles, but don't suceed. Jena Malone does act silly like Lydia, but with too much calculation. Donald Sutherland makes Mr. Bennett seem a very unfeeling man about anyone, including Elizabeth. Rupert Friend is far too young to be a contemporary of Matthew Macfadyen, plus far too young and eager looking for someone who had led a rake's life.After watching the film I came to the conclusion that I'd rather watch 2 hours of the 1995 adaptation than this film. With that said, the film does succeed as a period piece and as a film is certainly better than most film fare. I recommend it to the anyone excepting the most ardent admirers of Austen and the 1995 adaptation.",4,"Good as a movie, ok as a period piece, not all that great as an adaptation of Austen",1145404800,"04 19, 2006",2006,3671,"['so', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'approached', 'film', 'trepidation', 'dearly', 'love', '1995', 'version', 'not', 'just', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'course', 'months', 'film', 'release', ""'d"", 'heard', 'vastly', 'different', 'reviews', 'film', 'not', 'inconsequential', 'problems', 'Austen', 'fans', 'had', 'movie', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'tried', 'forget', 'what', ""'d"", 'heard', '1995', 'version', 'tried', 'be', 'as', 'impartial', 'possible', 'However', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'hard', 'forget', '1995', 'version.The', 'good', 'things', 'exceed', '1995', 'version', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'excellent', 'Jane', 'beautiful', 'enough', 'fit', 'description', 'Jane', 'being', 'most', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'Hertfordshire', 'something', 'Susannah', 'Harker', 'had', 'been', 'unable', 'do', 'also', 'steel', 'character', 'frequently', 'characterized', 'soft.The', 'music', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'so', 'beautifully', 'story', 'Patrick', 'Doyle', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'soundtrack.The', 'O.K', 'things', 'par', '1995', 'version', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'very', 'different', 'performance', 'Mrs.', 'Bennett', '1995', 'version', 'wholly', 'different', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'character', 'just', 'silly', 'endearing', 'ever.Simon', 'Woods', 'very', 'good', 'Mr.', 'Bingley', 'bumbling', 'part', 'down', 'clearly', 'conveys', 'feelings', 'Jane', 'particularly', 'enjoy', 'work', 'when', 'character', 'something', 'rather', 'nd', 'must', 'put', 'rights.Judy', 'Dench', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourgh', 'wonderful', 'casting', 'Dame', 'Dench', 'played', 'role', 'same', 'wonderful', 'imperiousness.Tom', 'Hollander', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'was', 'very', 'different', '1995', 'counterpart', 'played', 'role', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'admirably', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'time', 'came', 'screen', 'laugh', 'time', 'mentioned', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourgh', 'Rosings', 'made', 'one', 'funny', 'little', 'speeches.The', 'Bad', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', '1995', 'version', 'setting', 'costuming', 'looked', 'incredibly', 'seemed', 'people', 'making', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Bennetts', 'were', 'pretty', 'well', 'off', 'as', 'long', 'had', 'estate', '2,000', 'pounds', 'year', 'overall', 'appearance', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'Bingley', 'Darcy', 'de', 'Bourgh', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired.Keira', 'Knightley', 'just', 'not', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'Most', 'movie', 'acted', 'knew', 'was', 'remarkably', 'clever', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well.Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'definitely', 'not', 'fill', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'shoes', 'ability', 'act', 'eyes', 'helped', 'Firth', 'so', 'much', 'earlier', 'version', 'too', 'silent', 'dour', 'most', 'movie', 'when', 'finally', 'perk', 'far', 'too', 'late.There', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'certain', 'scenes', 'first', 'proposal', 'scene', 'seem', 'entirely', 'place', 'thoughts', 'attachment', 'beforehand', 'was', 'created', 'camera', 'not', '2', 'actors', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'had', 'more', 'chemistry', 'Darcy', 'bust', 'Darcy', 'himself.Jena', 'Malone', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Rupert', 'Friend', 'try', 'admirably', 'roles', 'do', ""n't"", 'suceed', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'act', 'silly', 'Lydia', 'too', 'much', 'calculation', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Mr.', 'Bennett', 'seem', 'very', 'unfeeling', 'man', 'anyone', 'including', 'Elizabeth', 'Rupert', 'Friend', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'be', 'contemporary', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'eager', 'looking', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'led', 'rake', 'life.After', 'watching', 'film', 'came', 'conclusion', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', '2', 'hours', '1995', 'adaptation', 'film', 'said', 'film', 'succeed', 'period', 'piece', 'film', 'certainly', 'better', 'most', 'film', 'fare', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'excepting', 'most', 'ardent', 'admirers', 'Austen', '1995', 'adaptation']",N/A

640900,A2ZX5079G6KROH,B00005JOHI,"Mike J. Rice ""'Mike Rice, Cultural Historian""","[3, 10]","Pride and Prejudice has a fantasticallyfast-moving opening at an Upper MiddleClass social gathering and dance.  We'reintroduced to Mr. and Mrs. Bennett and theirfive daughters in the middle of things.The Bennet Daughters are there to capturehusbands like every sensible woman inlate 18th century England.  Thespirited dancing seems to ape theemotions of the Bennet girls asthey wander about.The dance features not the usualsnobbish Brits but rather a free-wheeling group of normal socialites reflectingthe carefree, not posh and not snobbishBennets, their five daughtersand assorted friends.Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Bennet,Donald Sutherland her besieged, drollrather appalled father.  Mr. Bennet,as in the book, is called Mister evenby his daughters.  Every man is Mister.It makes the movie funnier  contrastingthe formality of  the Misters with theconvivial and fun-loving play of theBennet girls.Mrs. Bennet is a  shimmering pile ofunspent emotional fiery. The girls at anymoment, mother included, are likely tolose their heads at the sight ofa man with 5,000 a year.  That isif they're not having a joke at hisexpense at the time.At those moments, Mr. Bennent retreatsto his study, where he has a new plantto look at.Only Mrs. Bennet is a straight fortune-hunter.  The Bennet girls somehow have foundtime to understand genuine love, thoughMr. Bennet seems as unaware of this asMrs. Bennet.  Mr. Bennet seems to havesense you see.  How the girls learnedof true love is a mystery.Jane Austen's novel is set in apredatory England.  A man with 1,000pounds will stir interest.  A manwith 5,000 creates sheer excitement.Austen predates Dickens and the BronteSisters, but the Director has managedto include visuals lifted right fromthe heather of Wuthering Heights andhas placed Elizabeth in settings that justdo not exist in the somewhat hardscrabbleback yard of the lower middle class Bennets.There is an instance or two of an enormousboar in the house for instance.Elizabeth escapes home with a flock ofducks fluttering about, seeming toimitate her. The image is stolenfrom the thirties David Copperfield andcopied again with great effect inTom Jones.The only true snob in the film is MisterDarcy.  Poor Mister Darcy,he cannot bring himself to speak to mostwomen, considering them trivial.  Heboorishly connives to torpedo Elizabeth'ssister Mary's budding romance with thehandsome though high-haired Mr. Bingley.At the dance opening of the film, Elizabethfinds Darcy odd at first, then turns squarelyagainst him after encountering  hismore offensive traits. The audience knowsthat both are intrigued and Darcy may evenbe smitten.There is Mr. Collins, who, spotting Elizabethat the dance, immediately cocks his hat forher.  Only Lizzy is taller than he, his designson her seem more about money than love, andbesides, he and the film are moving too fast.There's room for one bounder in the shape ofMr. Wickham, who, it develops, knows and dislikesMr. Darcy as much as Elizabeth and tells herso.  A frame or two later he has run off withone of Elizabeth's sisters.  Mr. Collins toohas found matrimonial bliss in Elizabeth's friendwho confides to Elizabeth that she hasn'tattributes enough to wait for love to arriveat her door as Elizabeth has.The new Pride and Prejudice is certain to becompared with the 1995 BBC miniseries starring ColinFirth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth.Keira Knightley, who ran away with the movieKing Arthur two years ago, owns this film too.  Un-like the miniseries, she doesn't really have toshare with this Mr. Darcy (Matt McFadyen).Knightley seems to be at once Audrey Hepburnand Winona Ryder.  Judy Dench, almost a necessitynow in every British period film, plays Darcy'shigh-handed and very rich aunt with her usual bombast.Some screen notes say actress Emma Thompson gavethis fast-paced screenplay a touchup that is  un-credited except in end credits.  I laughed moreat this film than I did at the '95 miniseries.I could hear all of Darcy's, Mr. Bennet's, and Elizabeth'slines, but the rest was sometimes too British to understand.Still, one could read body language just as well in manyscenes.  Director Joe Wright pushed the movie along ata torrid pace.  At times his camera moves in and out ofdoors and windows peering at the bewildering contrastsin attitudes of the many lovers and players in justseconds.I recommend that everyone see it.  Its very funny.When Mr. Bennett learns Elizabeth finally wants to wedMr. Darcy after all, he becomes teary when telling hisdaughter why, totally stealing the scene from Miss Knightley.Score one for Mister Bennet.Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson were Darcy and Elizabethin the first 1940 version. An Indian Directress who refilmedVanity Fair in 2004 put out a Bollywood version of Prideand Prejudice early this year.The present version, more than the miniseries, remindsthat Louisa May Alcott borrowed heavily from Austen's Prideand Prejudice to produce Little Women in 1869.  The two novelshave nearly the same structure.  Pride and Prejudiceis a first instance of Chick Lit written in English.Its a story of girls for girls and any male who wantsto learn a few things about them they hadn't known.",4,"Mr. Bennet's

640902,AUSATFDSU2INS,B00005JOHI,"milss ""Yellow hair warrior""","[2, 5]","The English literature gives us a new adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew McFadyen.In the 18th century, the importance to achieve a good marriage was a fundamental pillar for the English society. For women, in particular, it was more than understandable that to live under that kind of pressure and social restrictions was a frustration, especially for the impetuous Elizabeth Bennet.Second among five sisters, Lizzie could be considered the rebel of the family, the Jo March of England, without a neurotic desire to be married for money or to be exposed to the agonizing rituals of traditional courting that was characteristic in that era.But when her matchmaker mother is aware that exists a remote but weak possibility to marry her older daughter Jane (Rosamund Pike) with a quite eligible bachelor (Simon Woods), Elizabeth trips accidentally with her match, the very observer, quiet, shy and taciturn Mr. Darcy (McFadyen).Darcy obviously sees Mrs. Bennet's intentions and driven by a sincere desire of protection keeps his friend from comitting to the lovely and shy Jane, while he and Elizabeth begin a turbulent relation of attraction and rejection, marked for his prejudice and her pride.One of the sharpest observations of Austen's novels is that the rich were used to judge the less prosperous for trying to assure a advantageous marriage, without realizing that they did exactly the same thing. Nowadays, this history of social acceptance, values, misundertandings and prejudices is as valid as it was in past times.The film had the joyous luck of counting with a terrific cast: from the childish sisters of Elizabeth, her shameless mother (a glorious Brenda Blethyn), the prepotent Lady Catherine (a magnificent Judi Dench) and Donald Sutherland as the absent minded and easy-going patriarch Bennet . Clearly, the stars of the history -Knightley and McFadyen- shine above this group. As Lizzie, Knightley is a bubbly mixture of passion, intelligence, defiance and vulnerability. Mr. Darcy, in turn, finds in McFadyen the perfect mixture of modesty, enigm, volatility, tenderness and dettachment, but simply with one look is capable of lettiing us see that his attitude is only a mask.Who is more proud or prejudiced? It's difficult to decide, since Lizzie and Darcy are so alike, and this is why the romance of these two is so provocative. Is clear that Elizabeth and Darcy are made for each other, and even thought neither of them will recognize it at first, theirs' is a soulmates encounter, and their relation is based on mutual respect, admiration, attraction and above all, a clear vision that love is a lot more than what some pretty words can express.",5,Devious encounter of soulmates,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,2725,"['English', 'literature', 'new', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'starring', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Matthew', 'McFadyen.In', '18th', 'century', 'importance', 'achieve', 'good', 'marriage', 'was', 'fundamental', 'pillar', 'English', 'society', 'women', 'particular', 'was', 'more', 'understandable', 'live', 'kind', 'pressure', 'social', 'restrictions', 'was', 'frustration', 'especially', 'impetuous', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet.Second', 'five', 'sisters', 'Lizzie', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'rebel', 'family', 'Jo', 'March', 'England', 'neurotic', 'desire', 'be', 'married', 'money', 'be', 'exposed', 'agonizing', 'rituals', 'traditional', 'courting', 'was', 'characteristic', 'era.But', 'when', 'matchmaker', 'mother', 'aware', 'remote', 'weak', 'possibility', 'marry', 'older', 'daughter', 'Jane', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'quite', 'eligible', 'bachelor', 'Simon', 'Woods', 'Elizabeth', 'accidentally', 'match', 'very', 'observer', 'quiet', 'shy', 'taciturn', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'McFadyen', 'obviously', 'sees', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'intentions', 'driven', 'sincere', 'desire', 'protection', 'friend', 'comitting', 'lovely', 'shy', 'Jane', 'Elizabeth', 'begin', 'turbulent', 'relation', 'attraction', 'rejection', 'marked', 'prejudice', 'pride.One', 'sharpest', 'observations', 'Austen', 'novels', 'rich', 'were', 'used', 'judge', 'less', 'prosperous', 'trying', 'assure', 'advantageous', 'marriage', 'realizing', 'did', 'exactly', 'same', 'thing', 'Nowadays', 'history', 'social', 'acceptance', 'values', 'misundertandings', 'prejudices', 'as', 'valid', 'was', 'past', 'times.The', 'film', 'had', 'joyous', 'luck', 'counting', 'terrific', 'cast', 'childish', 'sisters', 'Elizabeth', 'shameless', 'mother', 'glorious', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'prepotent', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'magnificent', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'absent', 'minded', 'easy-going', 'patriarch', 'Bennet', 'Clearly', 'stars', 'history', '-Knightley', 'McFadyen-', 'shine', 'group', 'Lizzie', 'Knightley', 'bubbly', 'mixture', 'passion', 'intelligence', 'defiance', 'vulnerability', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'turn', 'McFadyen', 'perfect', 'mixture', 'modesty', 'enigm', 'volatility', 'tenderness', 'dettachment', 'simply', 'one', 'look', 'capable', 'lettiing', 'see', 'attitude', 'only', 'mask.Who', 'more', 'proud', 'prejudiced', 'difficult', 'decide', 'Lizzie', 'Darcy', 'are', 'so', 'alike', 'why', 'romance', 'two', 'so', 'provocative', 'clear', 'Elizabeth', 'Darcy', 'are', 'made', 'other', 'even', 'thought', 'will', 'recognize', 'first', 'theirs', 'soulmates', 'encounter', 'relation', 'based', 'mutual', 'respect', 'admiration', 'attraction', 'clear', 'vision', 'love', 'lot', 'more', 'what', 'pretty', 'words', 'can', 'express']",N/A

640904,A2U1BL88JRGVXH,B00005JOHI,"Minal Patel ""Bookworm""","[5, 9]","from the comments that the Director  makes on the DVD it feels like he misunderstands the relationship between Jane and Elizabeth. I think he also fails to use the letters in the movie to their full extent.  In Jane Austens time as I understand it letters were a very important form of communication, especially when it came to intimacy and I think they have been waved aside in this movie.  The movie could have used the letters to emphasize intimacy between characters and I think that the Director completely misses out on this opportunity. The bonnets were also very important in Jane Austens time especially in terms of a lady's ""natural and unblemished [freckle free] complexion"" and  eligibility for marriage and yet the director dismisses the Bonnet as a clich&eacute; and uses it far less than needed. The Bennet sisters for example have already got strikes against them in terms of marriability why give them another one by refusing them a bonnet? The book also says that by the time that it was written any real affection that Mr. Bennet may have felt for Mrs. Bennet has long since died out.  The movie contradicts this. I also feel as though the Movie version of Mrs. Bennet cares more for her eldest daughters than is indicated in the book, and that she is a far more understanding and sensible woman in the movie than she is in the book and Darcy's objections to marrying Elizabeth therefore carry less weight than they do in the book because she is not as lacking in sense as she is in the book.  The last scene ended a bit abruptly for me.  This movie is based on a love story and I think that the kiss needs to have lasted longer and not been cut off so abruptly and waved away like it was. I am also a bit confused about the commentary about there being no make up available to ladies at this time as some websites indicate that something resembling make up did exist at this point in time. I did like the person who acted out Mr. Collins - very well done, most of the other actors too although I'm not sure about Mr. Bingley's ""silly scene"" (when Jane is sick) seems a bit out of character. I like Keirra Knightly, and the person who played Darcy. I think the movie could have done without some of the nature scenes.

640906,A1S32HU2JQ5MFG,B00005JOHI,"Miss Jane ""book girl""","[50, 69]","I must confess to being one of the many doubters, who wondered aloud when the trailers for this P & P came out, Do we need another one? At the time my answer was: We Don't.  After finally viewing it, my opinion remains unchanged.  And it isn't just that the BBC version got it so right that we can't get over it.  It's a lot more: No doubt, there are moments of beautiful film captured here.  But the screenplay, which squeezes the book into just over two hours -- is botched, terribly so.  We know from other Jane Austen films that it is NOT impossible to capture the essence of the novel in a short time frame (when in doubt, please consult Emma Thompson!); nothing close to coherence happens in this film, as anyone who has read the novel and watched it can attest.  Those familiar with the novel will see immediately where scenes have been combined, re-arranged, or re-imagined entirely, often to bizarre effect.  Those who haven't read the novel will be utterly confused.  One explanation will suffice: Wickham's character is not sufficiently developed to make it clear why he departs, and why Elizabeth is so upset when Lydia elopes with him.  All of the important context for this storyline is dropped.  The random modernizing of language serves no purpose that I can find -- either leave Austen's beautiful language alone, or modernize entirely, and update the time as well, whereby Emma becomes ""Clueless.""  As to characterization, I find no evidence of Lizzy's and Mr Bennet's wonderful relationship (in fact, Donald Sutherland looks bored), I don't see much chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy, or much chemistry between anyone for that matter.  Costumes are not period appropriate, which again would be fine, if there was some coherence to the choices that were made.  And why is everyone's hair wild and ukepmt?  Finally, I am told that the Bennet's ""status reduction"" -- whereby Longborn is made to look poorer than the novel suggests -- was done to draw a clearer distinction between Elizabeth's and Darcy's status.  This was hardly necessary, and random flights of geese, chickens and pigs all over the place is completely annoying.  The entire film feels rushed and perfunctory, like the cast is haunted by the ghosts of prior versions, even before the camera starts rolling, and says ""Let's just get on with it.""

While I very much like Keira Knightley in other things she's done and I think she does well enough capturing the spirit of Lizzie here (and I very much like the actress here who plays her friend, Charlotte Lucas), I think the way the director and screenwriter strove for naturalism in this version made the Bennetts and their house and grounds in particular, as one other reviewer here has described it, too frumpy and dumpy for what one would expect from what Lizzie describes herself as being a 'gentlemen's daughter.'  There is almost a total LACK of gentility and manners in this Bennett clan - forget impropriety - we've gone way overboard.  Keira Knightley's hair, while more 'sexy' looking as modern standards of beauty go, would have been considered quite unkempt and wild when she goes to Bingley's to visit Jane in this version.  Her skirt is '6 inches deep in mud' but otherwise we can assume Lizzie had some idea of the proprieties, otherwise Darcy would not have exempted her and Jane from his condemnation of the rest of the family for not always following social mores/conduct/propriety.  While the scene with Darcy walking across the field with his shirt open is romantic, it's not in the book and seemingly out of character with the Darcy Austen wrote.  I loved Colin Firth's Darcy, and I also loved Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivier's portrayals.

Making a film of this story is a privilege because of the material in the book. I loved the previous two adaptations made in Britain by the BBC, the last one from 1995 being exceptionally good. Colin Firth and Ms. Ehle were outstanding in these roles and apparently lived and breathed Darcy and Elizabeth for a whole summer. This latest adaptation doesn't even come close to the standards in the BBC version. It seemed as though this version tried to be different from the 1995 version, and failed as a result because this required a departure from the book.I found the acting surprisingly awful. Mr. Darcy in the 2005 adaptation lacked conviction, and seemed to be bored with the role he was supposed to be playing, when he wasn't trying to stay awake. Colin Firth was far more convincing. The other characters were almost as bad, including Ms. Knightley. The silly 20th Century smirks and childish behaviour, just didn't translate to the period of time that the book deals with. Jane Austen's great lines and dialogue were replaced with many 21st Century lines which although at times funny, didn't fit with the period. I do not understand why the Bennet family was made to appear very rural and poor. They were not poor in the book, but quite well to do. Like Shakespeare such modern adaptations can work, but this one was difficult to fathom. I look forward to seeing another Pride & Prejudice adaptation, but the 1995 version is the gold standard to which they will need to be compared, and not this version.Some positive points:Great CD with wonderful music.

I thought it was going to be a long, drawn out & boring old-time flick about snobby people gossiping about each other. I was PLEASANTLY surprised. It caught my attention from beginning to end. The characters were SO likable. Yes, even the two-faced snobby rich sister, annoying mother & giddy younger sisters! They bugged me but made the movie that much more enjoyable. It was very nice how the script was able to portray the way of life back then. Although the Bennets lived in what we consider a huge house they were considered penniless. 5,000 pounds a year was considered rich. Trying to marry off your daughters to the wealthiest man possible was a goal a mother must bear (at least THIS one).I try to avoid watching Donald Sutherland movies as much as possible. He does so much better with villain roles than good-guy ones. Other than the failed attempt to an English accent, I really couldn't help liking his character in this movie very much. In fact, he was one of my favorites throughout the movie. Especially after he contradicted his wife when choosing sides w/Elizabeth in rejecting Mr. Collins' proposal of marriage.Personally, I don't think Knightley is the hottest fox out there but it fits her role of ""nearly tolerable"". Yeah, the lips have always bugged me but I looked past that because she's been great in all the roles I've seen her in. What I found most surprising was when Mr. Darcy first appeared, I had wished they'd picked a more handsome actor. His presentation of the role made him out to be SO irresistible and handsome. I loved the rain-scene the best. You were able to see his big blue eyes & he looked sexiest there.All in all, this was a very passionate & romantic movie.

Joe Wright does an impeccable job of getting a dense and wordy novel down to the essentials of the story, and still leave time to savour the beauty of England and the cast.The story involves Lizzy and her 4 sisters, following their path to marriage through the minefield of Georgian conventions of 1797 (when the movie was set)and English social mores. The pride and the prejudices come from every angle in this classic and timeless story.There are several ingredients here that simply make this work to perfection. The cast is for the most part spot on, with Keira Knightley in top form as the headstrong Lizzy, looking, sounding and emoting every inch the part. She is surrounded by Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland as her father and mother, Judi Dench as a Lady Catherine to make you wither in your boots (unless you are Lizzy of course), ravishing Rosamund Pike as her older sister and Tom Hollander as the wimpy cleric, amongst others. The only slight let down, and only because the others are so good, is Matthew MacFadyen, who is perfectly adequately brooding as Darcy, but compared to Colin Firth lacks the charisma to make such a character attractive to Lizzy.Therein lies the problem, if any, with this adaptation - it cannot help but be compared to the impeccable casting and pedigree of the BBC version, which is still the definitive version because of its length, which allows it to stick more rigidly and fully to the book. But this movie must be taken on its own merits, and succeeds where the BBC version could not, in the scale and beauty of the photography - England looks absolutely beautiful here. The mud and dirt are all there - this is no stagey drama - but the beauty of the photography illuminates fantastic interiors of houses rich to poor, and most especially the exteriors of Georgian facades, and natures rich greens and majestic moors.I should also mention the music by Dario Marianelli which is a perfect contributor to the movie, beautifully classic while never dull, somewhat like the ivory tinklings of Michael Nyman (The Piano), but not nearly so minimalist, with lush orchestra where appropriate, and lively jigs for the ball scenes making them seem genuinely like something that would have been fun to attend.Overall, I suggest avoiding comparison with the BBC version, and take this movie as the definitive cinema version, at least.- a p.s. there are plenty of extras on the desk fleshing out history and Jane Austen as well as the usual 'making of' stuff, but most interesting is the alternative ending for the US market - this adds a scene of Lizzy and Darcy together cuddling and expressing their love, which seems much more like a Hollywood add on than the original ending, and adds nothing other than some saccharine for those who cannot find the romance in the story but require it spelt out.",5,Fantastic entertainment for both fans and newcomers to Austen,1171411200,"02 14, 2007",2007,2915,"['What', 'classy', 'movie', 'successor', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'movies', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'impeccable', 'job', 'getting', 'dense', 'wordy', 'novel', 'essentials', 'story', 'still', 'leave', 'time', 'savour', 'beauty', 'England', 'cast.The', 'story', 'Lizzy', '4', 'sisters', 'following', 'path', 'marriage', 'minefield', 'Georgian', 'conventions', '1797', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'English', 'social', 'mores', 'pride', 'prejudices', 'come', 'angle', 'classic', 'timeless', 'story.There', 'are', 'several', 'ingredients', 'here', 'simply', 'make', 'work', 'perfection', 'cast', 'most', 'part', 'spot', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'top', 'form', 'headstrong', 'Lizzy', 'looking', 'sounding', 'emoting', 'inch', 'part', 'surrounded', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'father', 'mother', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'make', 'wither', 'boots', 'are', 'Lizzy', 'course', 'ravishing', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'older', 'sister', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'wimpy', 'cleric', 'amongst', 'others', 'only', 'slight', 'let', 'down', 'only', 'others', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'who', 'perfectly', 'adequately', 'brooding', 'Darcy', 'compared', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'charisma', 'make', 'such', 'character', 'attractive', 'Lizzy.Therein', 'problem', 'adaptation', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'compared', 'impeccable', 'casting', 'pedigree', 'BBC', 'version', 'still', 'definitive', 'version', 'length', 'stick', 'more', 'rigidly', 'fully', 'book', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'own', 'merits', 'where', 'BBC', 'version', 'could', 'not', 'scale', 'beauty', 'photography', 'England', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'here', 'mud', 'dirt', 'are', 'there', 'stagey', 'drama', 'beauty', 'photography', 'fantastic', 'interiors', 'houses', 'rich', 'poor', 'most', 'especially', 'exteriors', 'Georgian', 'facades', 'natures', 'rich', 'greens', 'majestic', 'moors.I', 'should', 'also', 'mention', 'music', 'Dario', 'Marianelli', 'perfect', 'contributor', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'classic', 'never', 'dull', 'somewhat', 'ivory', 'tinklings', 'Michael', 'Nyman', 'Piano', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'minimalist', 'lush', 'orchestra', 'where', 'appropriate', 'lively', 'jigs', 'ball', 'scenes', 'making', 'seem', 'genuinely', 'something', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'attend.Overall', 'suggest', 'avoiding', 'comparison', 'BBC', 'version', 'take', 'movie', 'definitive', 'cinema', 'version', 'least.-', 'p.s', 'are', 'plenty', 'extras', 'desk', 'fleshing', 'out', 'history', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'as', 'well', 'usual', ""'making"", 'stuff', 'most', 'interesting', 'alternative', 'ending', 'US', 'market', 'scene', 'Lizzy', 'Darcy', 'together', 'cuddling', 'expressing', 'love', 'much', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'add', 'original', 'ending', 'nothing', 'other', 'saccharine', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'romance', 'story', 'require', 'spelt', 'out']",N/A

""Classic literature fanatic""","[7, 13]","While I will admit this is an adequate adaptation of Austen's beloved Pride and Prejudice, I'm afraid that I can praise it no more than that.  Yet again, this is an instance of Hollywood production and direction and the overtness of both overriding the subtle nuances of this keenly written novel and its themes of love and possession.I won't comment on the actors' performances here because, again, the only word I can use to describe the ensemble cast is adequate.  I will note, however, that Kiera Knightely shines as Lizzie Bennett, albeit a little too giddy for my taste, and that Matthew McFayden's Darcy is more somber bordering on depressed than haughty or proud.In attempting to amplify the unsuitability of Lizzie as a match for Darcy, the producer of the film opts to place her family in relative squalor and, by doing so, completely subverts the delicate relationship and definition between the classes in Regency England.Although the film follows Austen's narrative quite closely, it departs from it often in terms of dialogue and action.  How inappropriate would it have been for Darcy to come bursting in the door of Lizzie's bedroom!  Lizzie says things like ""I have no idea.""  ""I haven't the smallest idea"" or ""I haven't the slightest idea"" would have been more correct.  ""I have no idea"" is a more contemporary phrase, and should not be made to feel at home in any movie which claims to be based on Austen's work.Those scenes in particular which veer from the manners and mannerisms of Austen's England just make the film a little too pedestrian for my taste.  ""You have bewitched me body and soul""?  Hardly.  Although it may have been said of Darcy, it is not something that Austen's Darcy would have uttered.  What utter tripe and nonsense!  Even Charlotte Bronte, author of ""Jane Eyre"", was not a fan of Austen's because of what she believed to be a definitive lack of passion in Austen's writing.  It's not so much that passion is lacking, more that it is restrained, so for Darcy to exhibit that sort of passion would be completely inconsisent with the character Austen created.  I actually cringed my way through the last fifteen minutes.  ""'Godess Divine' on Sundays'""?  Don't make me laugh.  There is such a thing as leaving some things to the imagination.  It is a pity that some movie producers just haven't mastered that fine art.All in all, if you view the film as simply a movie NOT based on the book, then it's enjoyable.  If you're a purist, as I am, take my advice and rent this one, don't buy it, and take it for what it is.  If you want to see Austenian adaptations at their finest, RUN AND BUY the A&E; production of Pride and Prejudice instead, or Persuasion, starring Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root.",3,Best movie of the year?

As to the complaints about cuts and re-working of scenes, the film makers didn't have the luxury of five hours to tell the tale verbatum. I took my two nephews (age 16 & 14) to see this, and they both liked it. The older one is an avid reader who had been told by an older brother that Austen was dry and boring, so he expected to hate the movie going in and didn't. Now he's reading Austen and enjoying it. So where is the harm in knowing this is an adaptation and won't be completely faithful to the book? If you want a completely faithful version of the book, read the book.As to the particulars about my choice of rating: Keira Knightly is lovely as Elizabeth without outshining Rosamund Pike in beauty as Jane. Matthew Macfadyen does an outstanding job of showing us what Mr. Darcy is feeling and thinking. There's no other way to portray it in a movie; in the book, Austen puts us into his head so he doesn't have to show it. Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn shine as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, presenting them as warm, real human beings rather than charactures. And Tom Hollander gives an amazing and completely different read on Mr. Collins. Usually played as a complete buffoon, here he is an ackward misanthrope who seems aware of the fact that there's something not quite right with how he comes across. It would have been nice if Judi Dench's scenes as Lady Catherine hadn't been cut so much, but there's that time restraint coming into play. Plus, you can't have everything.As to this DVD: Nice rendering. Good picture. Lovely sound. I only wish that the extras were a little more beefed up. I was sad to find no deleted scenes.

Unfortunately,  I watched this 2006 version  from beginning to end and, again, I did not find much to like.  The scenery and music were wonderful; however, the characters are not developed well with Lizzie being  a big disappointment - she did not behave ladylike, she seemed to just giggle and had no wit.

Mr Bennet does not strike me as gentleman like - he was a landed gentleman with an adequate income, but a spendthrift wife.  I like Mr. Darcy, but he is still in third place.  I would have liked to see more of Mr Wickham - but we don't get to know him, and consequently cannot dislike him as we should.How improper to have Mr. Bingley go into the room where Jane is in bed with a cold - they seem to have copied the scene from the Hollywood version.

I loved the score, I loved the cinematography, and I loved the casting.Kiera Knightley made a wonderful Elizabeth Bennet, and Matthew Macfadyen was a superb Darcy. Both of their performances were great. Macfadyen seemed to understand that, at first, Darcy had to be quite an unlikable character. However, as the movie progresses, the viewer (as well as Lizzie) learns more about him and grows to like him. It seems that, sometimes, actors are afraid to fully embody those unlikable characters unless they know they are playing the villain. But there are plenty of unlikable people in everyday life who are not villains. They are just cold, or boorish, or rude, or whatever. There are LOTS of folks with no bad intentions who are just plain draggy to be with.I really enjoyed how the movie stayed true to the spirit novel we've all known and loved, without become a slave to the book. (After all, movies and books are quite different mediums, and audiences change drastically over time.) I haven't seen much else that Joe Wright, the director, has done, but you can bet I'll be keeping an eye on him for the future.Near the end of the film, Darcy comes walking out of the morning mist, long coattails flapping in the breeze, to tell Lizzie that she has bewitched him, body and soul.

It is everything a movie should be, and then some. Great storytelling, an amazing soundtrack, an innovative director and a splendid soundtrack, it is definitely a movie you should own.It tells a classic story of Elizabeth Bennet, a smart, boyish heroine who meets the handsome Mr. Darcy, and judging solely on first impressions, believes he is ""the last man on Earth she could ever possibly be prevailed upon to marry"". Of course, it wouldn't be a Jane Austen adaptation if it wasn't for numerous plot twists, complicated character connections and humorous plays on words.Keira Knightley is perfect as Elizabeth, the role which not only propelled her to stardom, but also earned her an Oscar nomination in 2005. She is everything a classic heroine should be - sensual, expressive and beautiful, maybe even a little more than she should have been. On the other hand, there is Matthew Macfadyen, who makes a great, darker Mr. Darcy. Also in the all-star cast are veterans Donald Sutherland and Dame Judy Dench.Director Joe Wright did an incredible job. Not only did he play with the source in a very respectful, yet creative way, he used many tricks to make us care for these characters and believe their plights are just as well possible today. He also uses the stunning British countryside a number of times, and it is one of the film's best props - it is able to, accompanied by a great soundtrack, reflect the characters' emotions and send chills up and down one's spine.""Pride & Prejudice"" is definitely one of the best romantic movies and literary adaptations of the century, and one you should have on your shelf for sure.",5,A cinematic tour-de-force!,1211587200,"05 24, 2008",2008,1782,"['Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'period', 'dramas', 'literary', 'adaptations', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'was', 'delighted', 'latest', 'adaptation', 'Jane', ""Austen'sPride"", 'Prejudice', 'everything', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'then', 'Great', 'storytelling', 'amazing', 'soundtrack', 'innovative', 'director', 'splendid', 'soundtrack', 'definitely', 'movie', 'should', 'own.It', 'tells', 'classic', 'story', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'smart', 'boyish', 'heroine', 'who', 'handsome', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'judging', 'solely', 'first', 'impressions', 'last', 'man', 'Earth', 'could', 'ever', 'possibly', 'be', 'prevailed', 'marry', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'adaptation', 'was', ""n't"", 'numerous', 'plot', 'twists', 'complicated', 'character', 'connections', 'humorous', 'plays', 'words.Keira', 'Knightley', 'perfect', 'Elizabeth', 'role', 'not', 'only', 'propelled', 'stardom', 'also', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', '2005', 'everything', 'classic', 'heroine', 'should', 'be', 'sensual', 'expressive', 'beautiful', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'hand', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'who', 'great', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Also', 'all-star', 'cast', 'are', 'veterans', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Dame', 'Judy', 'Dench.Director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'did', 'incredible', 'job', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'play', 'source', 'very', 'respectful', 'yet', 'creative', 'way', 'used', 'many', 'tricks', 'make', 'care', 'characters', 'believe', 'plights', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'possible', 'today', 'also', 'stunning', 'British', 'countryside', 'number', 'times', 'one', 'film', 'best', 'able', 'accompanied', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'reflect', 'characters', 'emotions', 'send', 'chills', 'up', 'one', 'spine', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'romantic', 'movies', 'literary', 'adaptations', 'century', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'shelf', 'sure']",N/A

And... wait a moment, I've just run out compliments. In general, I thought this was a terrible adaptation of the Jane Austen novel. There were so many things wrong with it that I hardly know where to begin, and it would make tiresome reading if I were to list all of the film's faults. However, in brief...The film is hampered at the get-go by its very abbreviated running time of just over two hours. This is far too short to do the book any kind of justice, my opinion being that the best way to adapt classic novels on film is in the form of a television mini-series, where the producers can spend three, or four, or six hours to tell the story properly. Far too much material was condensed or cut entirely in this film, for it to be a satisfactory adaptation in any way.But that's just the beginning... another major problem is that nearly every character is portrayed in a way that is absolutely contrary to their personalities as depicted in the novel. Some examples... Mr Bingley, with his moronic grin, complete inability to carry on a simple conversation, and bizarrely wild hair-style, seems primed to take up the office of village idiot (that, or he may be slightly insane; either way, it's difficult to see why Jane admires him). Elizabeth comes across as rude and shrewish in several scenes, and Mrs Bennet (while dead common) appears to be a rather sensible and practical woman, instead of a featherbrain. Mr Darcy is melancholy and brooding, instead of proud and arrogant, and Mr Collins is dull and studious instead of obsequious and ridiculous. Miss Darcy is outgoing and vivacious instead of shy and retiring---etc., etc...Scenes containing important bits of dialogue have been transposed to incongruous locations that are ill-suited for the purpose, and there are many period details that are utterly incorrect. (Let's not even discuss the unattractive costuming; Keira Knightley goes through much of the film looking like she's wearing an assortment of ill-fitting sacks.)Okay, I guess you may have guessed by now that I really disliked this film! I'm frankly astounded by the fact that it has gotten a fairly positive response in general, with many people saying that it's a fine adaptation of the novel. I don't know how to respond to that attitude, other than to wonder if these people have actually read the book, or seen the film in question.

I've never been a fan of Kiera Knightley, but she does well here. I do think she played the part a little more teenage and a little less snarky than it was meant to be, but I'm sure the director was behind that 100%. This is, after all, aimed at the young audience. It's screaming, ""I'm new, I'm fresh, I'm just like you!"". Matthew MacFaden seems a little bored, to be honest. When he proposes the first time, it sounds like he's reading a phone book. Of course, I may be just comparing him to Firth because actually he and Knightley are good together. The real star here, though, is Tom Hollander.

640947,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00005JOHI,Only-A-Child,"[7, 12]","It is my sincere wish that Jane Austen readers and non-readers  not miss a big screen viewing of Joe Wright's ""Pride & Prejudice"" because they let themselves be influenced by negative comments from the Ellen Jamesian sect of the Jane Austen society.  Particularly odious are those presumptuous enough to declare that Austen herself would consider the film a disservice.  Attempting to discourage potential viewers in this manner reveals not just a staggering conceit, but an utter cluelessness about how to read a film and about the power of a visual medium.This film adaptation of Austen's classic is the first one to fully capture its essence within the economical and efficient package of a two-hour feature film.  And it does so in a technically proficient way (cinematography-production design-editing); with perfect physical casting, excellent directing and scene staging, and fine performances from the entire ensemble.  In isolation it is simply the best film ever made, but because it is not an original screenplay the critics have downgraded it a bit from A plus to A minus (their acknowledgement of the debt it owns to Austen).Jane Austen once said,  ""an artist cannot do anything slovenly"".  Joe Wright's film is not perfect but it is the least slovenly in cinema history.  I was reminded of this by the film's treatment of Georgiana, Darcy's sister.  Georgiana was a minor but extremely important character in the book.  Elizabeth's point of view observations of Darcy's tender treatment of his shy little sister is how Austen shows Elizabeth's first realization that Darcy is worthy of her love.  Initially I was disappointed that Georgiana only has two brief appearances in the film, but on reflection I realized that the scenes had been staged and scripted so well that they said everything  needed about the relationship dynamics of the three characters.The film successfully brings Austen's ironic (insert comic here) observations of character and manners to the screen.  As the title proclaims, this story has a double theme, the pride of the aristocrat prejudicing the middle class heroine against him.  But as Elizabeth explains to her father in my favorite scene, she and Darcy are the flip sides of each other as her pride has long blinded her to Darcy's efforts to overcome the prejudice of his class to hers.The film also captures the more critical macro element of Austen's novel, the idea of a generous humanness that can transcend the motivations of social class.  Society is imperfect and while the social order encourages foolish prides and mean prejudices, it also enables kindness, affection, and courage.

The plot is essentially correct but the tone is frequently and incomprehensibly off.The general excellence of the actors, the dreamy cinematography and music, and the obvious care lavished on this movie make its flaws even more apparent and confusing. The Elizabeth and Jane Bennett described by Jane Austen would never listen at keyholes or shout at their mother or giggle at a feeble marriage proposal.  Mr. Collins was written as a comically pompous character; here he is so meek and awkward his romantic attempts are more pathetic than amusing and make the sisters' reactions seem cruel.The costumes and hair are inexplicable--Kitty and Lydia are dressed as if they are from a generation past, when they are the ones most concerned with fashion and are always buying new bonnets and gowns, and Elizabeth walks about with her hair down and in bare feet.  In reality, this would have been considered absolutely vulgar--akin to spitting tobacco--and never something a well-bred girl would do, no matter how high-spirited or independent.The Bennetts live in a place so ill-kept the animals wading across the yard look in danger of drowning in mud.  The Bennetts don't have the wealth of Bingley or Darcy, but they are supposed to be respectable, established gentry; Jed Clampett wouldn't own a place this slovenly.Despite all these missteps, this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is worth seeing for Keira Knightley's lively, if over-giggly, portrayal of Elizabeth and Matthew Macfadyen's interesting take on Darcy: he's more shy and subdued than actively arrogant (though his stuttering proposal at the end seems all wrong.  Love makes Darcy MORE eloquent, not less). The proposal scene in the rain is a highlight, and the plot stays true enough to the original for viewers to enjoy a cinematic vacation to Jane Austen's world.For the truest version of P and P, on all levels, definitely check out the BBC Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth version.

640959,A1QM7NGKJNX1RP,B00005JOHI,Paul L. McKaskle,"[13, 20]","I debated whether I should give the picture 3 or 4 stars.  I obviously chose 3.  The problem with the production is simply it is too short to give full credit to Jane Austin's book.  That said, it is well executed, which is why debated between the two ratings.The first problem is for those who have no prior familiarity with either the book or at minimum the two relatively recent much more lenghty mini series (the BBC-A&E; version with Colin Firth of 1995 and--in my view, the better--BBC-Australian version with Elizabeth Garvie of 1990).  So much is cut from this version that the nuances of what Austin was trying to convey are simply missing.  The three younger Bennet daughters are hardly differentiated, mostly they giggle and it is even hard to figure out which one is which.  I have just seen Carey Mulligan as a wonderful Ada in Bleak House, and it took me most of the movie to recognize her as Kitty, the second youngest daughter.  Eventually Lydia becomes recognizeable but only because she gets married to Wickam.Wickham appears only briefly at the beginning and though he tells Lizzie of Darcy's alleged mistreatment of him, one never realizes from this movie that Lizzie is unduly intrigued by him and is in danger of succumbing to his false charms.  We do hear of his falsity from Darcy's famous letter, but nothing more is provided to flesh out Wickham's perfidy until he ""elopes"" with Lydia.  (In particular, the wise words of the housekeeper at Pemberley, a neutral source, on the perfidy of Wickham, an important fact for Lizzie, are simply missing.)Although Charlotte appears early in the film, her significance is almost unnoted  Thus, it is unclear why it is of significance (to those who don't already know the book) that Mr. Collins marries her.  In general the repellant nature of Mr. Collins is seriously underplayed. He is almost a minor character.Mr. Bingley's married sister and her shiftless husband are entirely missing.  The Bennet manse is presented almost as farm, not a gentleman's small estate.  On the other hand, Chatsworth one of the grandest estates in England, the seat of the Duke of Devonshire, is presented as Pemberley.  This is much grander than Fitzwilliam Darcy would likely to have.  Darcy is not a Duke, and not even a lord.  (The movie script suggests that Darcy owns half of Derbyshire, and nothing in the book remotely suggest this, and if he has ""only"" 10,000 [pounds] a year--the only sum mentioned in the movie or book--it is highly unlikely that he owns more than a few thousand acres of Derbyshire.  Even the extremely wealthy Duke of Devonshire doesn't own more than a small fraction of Derbyshire.I won't go on with the faults.  Why do I give it 3 stars and even consider 4 stars?  Mainly because the most central points, the evolution of Elizabeth Bennet, full of prejudice and Fitzwilliam Darcy, full of pride, are reasonably well developed and are extremely well acted--particularly well developed for Elizabeth Bennet.  A number (though not all) of the key scenes of this relationship are well presented (though in somewhat truncated form which was necessary for fitting the whole movie into an approximate two hour length required for commercial movies).  Lady Catherine de Bourgh's ill-fated attempt to derail the budding romance between Lizzie and Darcy is well done (though also a bit truncated).  Mrs. Bennet's hysteria was dealt with sympathetically.I have read the book a half dozen times, seen the 1995 (Colin Firth) mini-series version a couple of times and the earlier Elizabeth Garvie mini-series version a dozen times, and so I know the story well enough to fill in for all of the important missing details.  With this prior knowledge, the plusses made it worthwhile for me to watch.  For someone is not particularly acquainted with Jane Austin's book (or last read it in high school many years ago) the movie provides a pleasant love story, even if it is seriously lacking in the subtlety of the original.  Knightley as Lizzie is a delight to look at and Macfayden may be the best Darcy on film--at least as far as the script allowed.But, at best, it is the ""highlights"" of Pride and Prejudice and is no substitute for the book, or at minimum, one of the mini-series.  As I indicated above the Elizabeth Garvie version of 1990 is, in my view, the best.  Elizabeth Garvie is incredible, she simply ""is"" Elizabeth Bennet.  This version also adheres closest to the text of the book, and is now available on an inexpensive DVD--which, incidentally, is more complete than the earlier VHS version.  (However, the Lawrence Olivier movie of the 1940s is, in my mind, a complete travesty to be avoided like the plague.)",3,"""Highlights"" of Pride and Prejudice",1141516800,"03 5, 2006",2006,4690,"['debated', 'should', 'give', 'picture', '3', '4', 'stars', 'obviously', 'chose', '3', 'problem', 'production', 'simply', 'too', 'short', 'give', 'full', 'credit', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'book', 'said', 'well', 'executed', 'why', 'debated', 'two', 'ratings.The', 'first', 'problem', 'who', 'have', 'prior', 'familiarity', 'book', 'minimum', 'two', 'relatively', 'recent', 'much', 'more', 'lenghty', 'mini', 'series', 'BBC-A', 'E', 'version', 'Colin', 'Firth', '1995', 'view', 'better', 'BBC-Australian', 'version', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvie', '1990', 'So', 'much', 'cut', 'version', 'nuances', 'what', 'Austin', 'was', 'trying', 'convey', 'are', 'simply', 'missing', 'three', 'younger', 'Bennet', 'daughters', 'are', 'hardly', 'differentiated', 'mostly', 'giggle', 'even', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'have', 'just', 'seen', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'wonderful', 'Ada', 'Bleak', 'House', 'took', 'most', 'movie', 'recognize', 'Kitty', 'second', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Eventually', 'Lydia', 'recognizeable', 'only', 'married', 'Wickam.Wickham', 'only', 'briefly', 'beginning', 'Lizzie', 'Darcy', 'alleged', 'mistreatment', 'one', 'never', 'movie', 'Lizzie', 'unduly', 'intrigued', 'danger', 'succumbing', 'false', 'charms', 'do', 'hear', 'falsity', 'Darcy', 'famous', 'letter', 'nothing', 'more', 'provided', 'flesh', 'out', 'Wickham', 'perfidy', 'elopes', 'Lydia', 'particular', 'wise', 'words', 'housekeeper', 'Pemberley', 'neutral', 'source', 'perfidy', 'Wickham', 'important', 'fact', 'Lizzie', 'are', 'simply', 'missing', 'Charlotte', 'early', 'film', 'significance', 'almost', 'unnoted', 'Thus', 'unclear', 'why', 'significance', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'book', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'general', 'repellant', 'nature', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'seriously', 'underplayed', 'almost', 'minor', 'character.Mr', 'Bingley', 'married', 'sister', 'shiftless', 'husband', 'are', 'entirely', 'missing', 'Bennet', 'manse', 'presented', 'almost', 'farm', 'not', 'gentleman', 'small', 'estate', 'other', 'hand', 'Chatsworth', 'one', 'grandest', 'estates', 'England', 'seat', 'Duke', 'Devonshire', 'presented', 'Pemberley', 'much', 'grander', 'Fitzwilliam', 'Darcy', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'Darcy', 'not', 'Duke', 'not', 'even', 'lord', 'movie', 'script', 'Darcy', 'half', 'Derbyshire', 'nothing', 'book', 'remotely', 'suggest', 'only', '10,000', '[', 'pounds', ']', 'year', 'only', 'sum', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'book', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'more', 'few', 'thousand', 'acres', 'Derbyshire', 'Even', 'extremely', 'wealthy', 'Duke', 'Devonshire', ""n't"", 'own', 'more', 'small', 'fraction', 'Derbyshire.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'faults', 'Why', 'do', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'even', 'consider', '4', 'stars', 'Mainly', 'most', 'central', 'points', 'evolution', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'full', 'prejudice', 'Fitzwilliam', 'Darcy', 'full', 'pride', 'are', 'reasonably', 'well', 'developed', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'particularly', 'well', 'developed', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'number', 'not', 'key', 'scenes', 'relationship', 'are', 'well', 'presented', 'somewhat', 'truncated', 'form', 'was', 'necessary', 'fitting', 'whole', 'movie', 'approximate', 'two', 'hour', 'length', 'required', 'commercial', 'movies', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourgh', 'ill-fated', 'attempt', 'derail', 'budding', 'romance', 'Lizzie', 'Darcy', 'well', 'done', 'also', 'bit', 'truncated', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'hysteria', 'was', 'dealt', 'sympathetically.I', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'half', 'dozen', 'times', 'seen', '1995', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'mini-series', 'version', 'couple', 'times', 'earlier', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvie', 'mini-series', 'version', 'dozen', 'times', 'so', 'know', 'story', 'well', 'enough', 'fill', 'important', 'missing', 'details', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'plusses', 'made', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'someone', 'not', 'particularly', 'acquainted', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'book', 'last', 'read', 'high', 'school', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'love', 'story', 'even', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'subtlety', 'original', 'Knightley', 'Lizzie', 'delight', 'look', 'Macfayden', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'Darcy', 'film', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'script', 'allowed.But', 'best', 'highlights', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'substitute', 'book', 'minimum', 'one', 'mini-series', 'indicated', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvie', 'version', '1990', 'view', 'best', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvie', 'incredible', 'simply', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'version', 'also', 'closest', 'text', 'book', 'now', 'available', 'inexpensive', 'DVD', 'incidentally', 'more', 'complete', 'earlier', 'VHS', 'version', 'However', 'Lawrence', 'Olivier', 'movie', '1940s', 'mind', 'complete', 'travesty', 'be', 'avoided', 'plague']",N/A

This story is the classic "" Pride and Prejudice"" story as told by Jane Austen once you've cut out all the exasperating and inconsequential details.  This movie gets right to the point without diminishing the theme or plot of the story.It is the classic tale of Elizabeth.  Elizabeth is smart, but loyal to her sisters.  Jane, Elizabeth's older sister, falls in love with Mr. Bingley.  Mr. Darcy is Mr. Bingley's best friend and insults Elizabeth, but is unaware that she can hear him.  Elizabeth is enchanted by Mr. Wickham.  Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy and through a series of misunderstandings on both their parts they end up misjudging both each and others.  Elizabeth finds out that Mr. Darcy encouraged Mr. Bingley not marry Jane because he believed that Jane didn't love Mr. Bingley.  Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth that he loves despite himself.  Elizabeth clears up the misunderstanding that Mr. Darcy had about Jane and she also tells him off.  Mr. Darcy writes a letter and explains the truth about Mr. Wickham and what a leech he is.  Elizabeth's feelings towards Mr. Darcy start to change.  Then Elzabeth's youngest and most foolish sister, Lydia runs off with Mr. Wickham.  Mr. Darcy uses his vast fortune to make certain that Mr. Wickham marries Lydia.  He also gets Mr. Bingley and Jane back together.  Elizabeth finds out about both of these things.  Both she and Mr. Darcy start telling each the truth about how they really feel about one another.  It is not hard to deduce what happens next.All in all this is a great romantic film.  Jane Austen, tends to beat around the bush too much.  This film takes out all unneccessary running around and it gets right to the point without changing the plot.  However if films where the primary focus is romance are not your thing I would advise against you watching this film.

640962,A2QEA1RKT5N09I,B00005JOHI,"Peter G. Keen ""rabidreader""","[6, 7]","P&P; is one of the jewels of English literature. It's very robust in that it is so open to different slants on it. This movie is a new slant and adds beautifully to the Ehle/Firth BBC interpretation. It's the more moving. Jennifer Ehle was my own perfect embodiment of Lizzie but Keira Knightley adds a dimension of extraordinary unfolding of the internal turmoil of Lizzie and her kindness -- the scenes with Jane are so subtle in their deep love for each other. Matthew Mcfadyen is a completely different Darcy from Colin Firth's but far more resonant. It is interesting to see Judi Dench in the film as the dreadful Lady Catherine. I am an old Brit who saw her in many performances on stage -- I think Keira K signals in this film that she is in the same league and on the same growth path.Critics of the film point out that it plays around somewhat with the tone and storyline of the novel. True, but it also enhances one's perspective on this great work. The movie is too kind to Mrs. Bennet but does articulate the truly desperate issue of marriage as the only career chance for young women. Donald Sutherland is a little underplayed especially in not showing his contempt for his wife but brings out so well his love for Lizzie. This is also the best portrayal of Jane I know of.And so on. Yes, this is not the literal adaptation of P&P; but it really is a superb accompaniment to and enhancement of it. Jsne Austen was in no way a romantic but a shrewd and cool observer. She is Mozartian in that the cool and controlled surface is moving in that the depth of feeling their work hides but dignifies is so intense. Only in her last and apparently semi-autbiographical novel, Persuasion, does one get a sense of the depth of her regrets and the pathos of her short life. I think that the main contribution of the Keira/Matthew combination is to bring P&P; closer to Persuasion and unpeel Austen's deep insights into and regrets about love in an age where feelings were so rarely expressed.This is a lovely and loving film. It is almost Chekovian in its style. I hope Knightley doesn't get nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal. It's far too good for that. I also hope she will pick scripts that help her grow beyond the Oscar-ready stuff.",5,"Austen, Mozart, Shakespeare -- all unique",1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,2247,"['P', 'P', 'one', 'jewels', 'English', 'literature', 'very', 'robust', 'so', 'open', 'different', 'slants', 'movie', 'new', 'slant', 'beautifully', 'Ehle/Firth', 'BBC', 'interpretation', 'more', 'moving', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'was', 'own', 'perfect', 'embodiment', 'Lizzie', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'dimension', 'extraordinary', 'unfolding', 'internal', 'turmoil', 'Lizzie', 'kindness', 'scenes', 'Jane', 'are', 'so', 'subtle', 'deep', 'love', 'other', 'Matthew', 'Mcfadyen', 'completely', 'different', 'Darcy', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'far', 'more', 'resonant', 'interesting', 'see', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'film', 'dreadful', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'am', 'old', 'Brit', 'who', 'saw', 'many', 'performances', 'stage', 'think', 'Keira', 'K', 'signals', 'film', 'same', 'league', 'same', 'growth', 'path.Critics', 'film', 'point', 'out', 'somewhat', 'tone', 'storyline', 'novel', 'True', 'also', 'one', 'perspective', 'great', 'work', 'movie', 'too', 'kind', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'articulate', 'truly', 'desperate', 'issue', 'marriage', 'only', 'career', 'chance', 'young', 'women', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'little', 'underplayed', 'especially', 'not', 'showing', 'contempt', 'wife', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'love', 'Lizzie', 'also', 'best', 'portrayal', 'Jane', 'know', 'of.And', 'so', 'Yes', 'not', 'literal', 'adaptation', 'P', 'P', 'really', 'superb', 'accompaniment', 'enhancement', 'Jsne', 'Austen', 'was', 'way', 'romantic', 'shrewd', 'cool', 'observer', 'Mozartian', 'cool', 'controlled', 'surface', 'moving', 'depth', 'feeling', 'work', 'hides', 'dignifies', 'so', 'intense', 'Only', 'last', 'apparently', 'semi-autbiographical', 'novel', 'Persuasion', 'one', 'get', 'sense', 'depth', 'regrets', 'pathos', 'short', 'life', 'think', 'main', 'contribution', 'Keira/Matthew', 'combination', 'bring', 'P', 'P', 'closer', 'Persuasion', 'unpeel', 'Austen', 'deep', 'insights', 'regrets', 'love', 'age', 'where', 'feelings', 'were', 'so', 'rarely', 'expressed.This', 'lovely', 'loving', 'film', 'almost', 'Chekovian', 'style', 'hope', 'Knightley', ""n't"", 'get', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'far', 'too', 'good', 'also', 'hope', 'will', 'pick', 'scripts', 'help', 'grow', 'Oscar-ready', 'stuff']",N/A

The BBC version was probably the best version of Pride and Prejudice. It remains true to the characters and to the tone of the book. It would remain the flagship and reference point for all other P&P; based movies.  I am certain that Jane Austin would have loved it. *****2. I also saw Bride and Prejudice (An adaptation). Although, it was far removed from the BBC Classic, It actually remained true to Jane Austin for the most part. A Comedy. A romantic comedy and very delightful. The Jane Austen Society was so enthused and ecstatic after sitting through a screening, they offered Chadha a lifetime membership. . On my first watch, I was expecting a serious classic and hence was disappointed. But on subsequent viewing, I thoroughly enjoyed the light humorous take on P&P.I; would wager that Jane would approve of Bride and Prejudice. ****3. This version? Well.. It is a romantic movie...but it is not a romantic comedy. It was way too serious more like Bront. Many of the characters were downright loathsome (Lizy's mom and Collins).  In that sense it was not Jane Austin,  But nevertheless it was not too bad.

They got it all wrong on so many accounts that I am trying to figure out where to begin. I really didn't care for this portrayal of the characters, they made the mother look like a sweet little lamb just trying to get her daughters married, Mr.Bingley like a bumbling idiot,and the three youngest girls act like children! Keira Knightley is beautiful, but a woman with that kind of flat chest would have been considerd deathly skinny, and not a man would have wanted her because she has no figure. They also portrayed the Bennets as being poor. Which is incorrect because the man didn't expect to have five daughters and therefore didn't make provision for there dowries.They were actually supposed to be upper middle class people. Lydia Bennet bothers me as does the relationship between Lizzie and Her father. They are supposed to be close, but through out the whole movie there relationship seems strained until towards the end where her father says that he will miss her.Boom! Right out of no where. And Lidia Bennet is supposed to be tall and good looking for her age, that's why she can attract the officers like flies. She flirts and looks cute. But no! The actress that plays her looks like she is a tall twelve year old. And speaking of looks, were they trying to go ugly when they cast Darcey? I thought he was supposed to be rich AND handsome. And if the guy that played Mr.Wickham would have wanted me to run away with him, I would have cried from insault! But, on a lighter note, they did cast Mr.Collins well. He is about as creepy as a little man can get. And this movie has some great cinematography. But the cons definantly weigh out the pros. I almost winced whenever Lizzie or Darcey spoke their lines, their delivery was awful. If you want to see THE BEST adaptation of a truely great story, stick to the unmolested version.

Little from the original, beyond the names of the characters, remains in this sorry attempt; characters are altered, society is turned on its head, and custom is thrown to the wind - in short, everything that made Pride and Prejudice the masterpiece that it is is discarded in favor of dramatic flare and overblown romantic nonsense. Which is all too bad - Knightley is a capable actress, and, with a script that was worthy of the name, would likely have made a very interesting Elizabeth Bennett. Alas, but this version is to Austen's novel (and previous film interpretations) what a preschooler's scribble is to the Mona Lisa.One of the beauties of Jane Austen's works was her depiction of social reality - the austere social boundaries, the condescension with which those who crossed them were met, the petty grievances and wiles of social climbers, etc., etc. The decision makers behind this film, however, apparently found that all far too tedious, and, in their wisdom, opted instead to introduce a host of classic elements of refined society, such as pigs in the house and a family full of eavesdroppers congregated about every door. While her family was mingling with the swine and fixing their ears to the nearest entryway, this Lizzy, unlike the intelligent but flawed Elizabeth of the book, preferred to simper and smirk more than anything else. Poor Mr. Darcy, however, fares no better, and wanders about aimlessly in this film, seeming at times as if he suffers more from bowel discomfort than symptoms of the heart. The rest of the characters fall into this pattern, seeming little more than absurd caricatures or parodies of the original.The scenarios are no less appalling than the characters. Gone are the societal strictures that governed life, and, in their favor, the annoying banalities of the ludicrously dramatized romance novel. The tedium of proposing in a parlor is traded for the excitement of proposing in the rain; the monotony of social calls made according to the custom of the day abandoned in favor of dramatic confrontations. In short, the authors of this script attempted to apply the formula of the trite, forgettable modern romance novel, with all of its absurd scenarios and fanciful gestures, to a masterpiece of historical social commentary, and a love story worthy of the name. In doing so, they failed to make either a compelling Austen adaptation, or even a tolerable romance.1/5 stars...try to understand the source if you're going to make a film about it...",1,"A cheap, overly dramatized romance masquerading as Austen",1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,2551,"['Where', 'Austen', 'Austen', 'adaptation', 'Little', 'original', 'names', 'characters', 'sorry', 'attempt', 'characters', 'are', 'altered', 'society', 'turned', 'head', 'custom', 'thrown', 'wind', 'short', 'everything', 'made', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'masterpiece', 'discarded', 'favor', 'dramatic', 'flare', 'overblown', 'romantic', 'nonsense', 'Which', 'too', 'bad', 'Knightley', 'capable', 'actress', 'script', 'was', 'worthy', 'name', 'would', 'likely', 'have', 'made', 'very', 'interesting', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'Alas', 'version', 'Austen', 'novel', 'previous', 'film', 'interpretations', 'what', 'preschooler', 'scribble', 'Mona', 'Lisa.One', 'beauties', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'works', 'was', 'depiction', 'social', 'reality', 'austere', 'social', 'boundaries', 'condescension', 'who', 'crossed', 'were', 'met', 'petty', 'grievances', 'wiles', 'social', 'climbers', 'etc.', 'etc', 'decision', 'makers', 'film', 'however', 'apparently', 'found', 'far', 'too', 'tedious', 'wisdom', 'opted', 'instead', 'introduce', 'host', 'classic', 'elements', 'refined', 'society', 'such', 'pigs', 'house', 'family', 'full', 'eavesdroppers', 'congregated', 'door', 'family', 'was', 'mingling', 'swine', 'fixing', 'ears', 'nearest', 'entryway', 'Lizzy', 'intelligent', 'flawed', 'Elizabeth', 'book', 'preferred', 'simper', 'smirk', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Poor', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'however', 'better', 'wanders', 'aimlessly', 'film', 'seeming', 'times', 'more', 'bowel', 'discomfort', 'symptoms', 'heart', 'rest', 'characters', 'fall', 'pattern', 'seeming', 'little', 'more', 'absurd', 'caricatures', 'parodies', 'original.The', 'scenarios', 'are', 'less', 'appalling', 'characters', 'Gone', 'are', 'societal', 'strictures', 'governed', 'life', 'favor', 'annoying', 'banalities', 'ludicrously', 'dramatized', 'romance', 'novel', 'tedium', 'proposing', 'parlor', 'traded', 'excitement', 'proposing', 'rain', 'monotony', 'social', 'calls', 'made', 'according', 'custom', 'day', 'abandoned', 'favor', 'dramatic', 'confrontations', 'short', 'authors', 'script', 'attempted', 'apply', 'formula', 'trite', 'forgettable', 'modern', 'romance', 'novel', 'absurd', 'scenarios', 'fanciful', 'gestures', 'masterpiece', 'historical', 'social', 'commentary', 'love', 'story', 'worthy', 'name', 'doing', 'so', 'failed', 'make', 'compelling', 'Austen', 'adaptation', 'even', 'tolerable', 'romance.1/5', 'stars', 'try', 'understand', 'source', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'film']",N/A

Colin, Jennifer Ehle, and A&E; articulate all the nuance possible for Jane Austen's text.  Matthew, Kiera Knightly, and director, Joe Wright cut through the fat and get to the meat, which is a good thing.  I have seen both versions (mini series and movie) and like them both.  It's a good thing that there are so many versions of this story available; this is a testament to the value of the basic story.Some may have problems with Joe Wright's 2005 movie version, but it is refreshing to see this interpretation/adaptation of the story.  The Bennets are brilliant cast as very rural gentry, which is what they were.  Moreover, Darcy and Bingley are not overly fastidious, as urbane gentlemen.  Judy Dench, of course, nails aristocratic Lady Catherine.  These are three levels of English society.  Social caste was critical during that time, so it is important that Wright emphasize levels such as aristocracy, urbane gentility, and rural landed gentry.  It is very credible in either version that these city boys (Darcy and Bingley) would prefer country girls rather than too polished city girls, as sometimes the artifice must stop.If pigs in the country offend, or museum-quality mansions on the other side of the country seem cold and unlivable, then stick with the A&E; version, which sticks very close to Jane Austen's book.

640986,A2L6QS8SVHT9RG,B00005JOHI,"randomartco ""period film aficionado""","[13, 17]","First off, the casting: Keira Knightley was a good choice for Elizabeth Bennet. She would not have been my first choice after the lovely job by Jennifer Ehle in A&E;/BBC's 1995 version, but Keira played the part very well and I believed in her Elizabeth from start to finish! Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy: all I can say is WOW! MacFadyen is a relative unknown (I know him only as the gambling loser Felix Carbury in Trollope's ""The Way We Live Now""): his portrayal was passionate, gritty, determined, loveable, heartfelt and moving: I was completely convinced and fell in love (as other Colin Firth fans will likely do so shortly). Added to these two top-notch choices is some other great talent: Rosamund Pike (Lady Harriet Cumnor in ""Wives & Daughters"") as Jane Bennet, Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet, Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet, Tom Hollander (Osborne Hamley in ""Wives & Daughters"") as Mr. Collins, and Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourg: the only somewhat puzzling choices were Rupert Friend as Mr. Wickham and Simon Woods as Mr. Bingley...they seemed to make Mr. Bingley's character incredibly nave and almost silly in this film (which I must admit, did add some nice comic relief), whereas the 1995 P&P; chooses to make him only too apt to believe the best in everyone too easily influenced by others. Mr Wickham was only slightly likeable to me, and was not given enough screen time for us to truly believe why Elizabeth defended him so much to Darcy. The cast was rounded out with Jena Malone as Lydia Bennet, Talulah Riley as Mary Bennet, and Carey Mulligan as Kitty Bennet, as well as a few others.The overall storyline and feel: I thought they did an excellent job condensing the storyline into a theatrical movie-length version. I was mighty impressed with the screenwriter, and was not surprised to find out that Emma Thompson (who wrote the screenplay for 1995's ""Sense & Sensibility"", as well as giving an Oscar-winning performance as Elinor Dashwood) did an un-credited and unpaid rewrite of the new ""Pride & Prejudice"" script: she is given a special thanks in the end credits. The cinematography of the film was well done, with gorgeous scenes and imagery created: the soundtrack score is excellent, soft and unassuming, but seems to blend perfectly with the film: highly recommended. There is little that I would like to change overall: a few content issues (as described below), and otherwise, my changes would be: 1) the final scene: it is a bit too modern-feeling, and not true to Jane Austen as it should be 2) one scene where Lizzie reads a letter: she is upset & crying, only I thought it felt a bit stilted and not quite credible 3) Lady Catherine's speech to Elizabeth: I felt it could have been stronger, and have more ""umph"" behind it. Set design and costumes: the costumes work perfectly with the mood and feel of the film: at first I was a bit disappointed that they put Elizabeth in so much brown, but it works very well with the grit and feel of the film (and makes it seem much more real), and there are times (like at the Netherfield Ball), when you get some gorgeous white & light-colored costumes on the characters (including a beautiful snow-white dress on Elizabeth, with a lovely upswept hairdo). I thought the set design was very well done, and loved the very realistic feel of the film: the comparison between the Bennet house and Pemberly is quite drastic and added to the credibility of Darcy's wealth.For those of you interested in ""family-friendly"" remarks, read this paragraph, otherwise you can skip to the next one. Content: There is one scene with a character walking through a room full of white, marble statues, mostly nude, and admiring them: mostly the shots show behinds, though some naked breasts are shown as well in a ceiling painting. There is one use of a*s, and little else in the way of language. There is some dialogue that alludes to the fact that an unmarried man & woman ran off together, not necessarily with any plans to get married, but it is eventually resolved; there is some cleavage shown, but nothing too drastic. All in all, the content is kept to a minimum.This beautifully-filmed and well-acted movie is well worth the time & effort of going to the movie theatre, in a day and age when there is often little that does such. The romance they created in a few scenes was, I felt, beyond compare. For those of you who loved & enjoyed A&E; and BBC's 1995 version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, you are in for a treat: there are enough differences in the movies to make them both loveable, but enough similarities in dialogue that you don't feel you are missing anything. This new film & soundtrack is highly recommended (I bought the soundtrack from Amazon UK a month ago, as it is being released Nov 15th in the USA): this movie will also end up being a must-add to any woman's DVD collection!!",5,Gorgeously-filmed & delightfully-enchanting new film adaptation!,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",2006,4900,"['First', 'off', 'casting', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'was', 'good',

She rivals Shakespeare as the greatest artist of English literature.  Both writers were concerned with basic human motivation, but Austen limited her observation to what she knew best, the courtship of 18th Century men and women of all classes.  She particularly enjoyed matching rather struggling middle class girls with the Bill Gates of their day, the local nobility.Keira Knightley makes a lovely Elizabeth Bennet.  She's has every virtue and flaw that her love match, Mr. Darcy possesses, and there is the problem.  They are so alike, they are blind to each other's virtues initially, obsessing upon their human foibles instead, mostly their unmitigated pride.  But what smitten couple of any century is any different.  Ah, Austen is universally appreciated since she spotlights what most Earthly inhabitants will encounter one or more times in a lifetime, love.I think I may prefer the Laurence Olivier version made in the 1930's.  After all, his Darcy is superb, never to be duplicated, but this newer version uses modern color cinematography to advantage.  Jane Austen is always worthwhile.

Then imagine this woman walking with vibrant piano playing in the background and her dress flowing in the breeze. Put her in an idyllic country setting and then set up an impossible romance. Then surround her with four lively sisters who love to dance and live for the faintest moment of romance. There are so many scenes in which these women amusingly listen at doors or giggle while discussing men. It is simply made even more intoxicating when these women engage men in witty banter. Truly, Elizabeth is a radiant delight. There is one scene where she expresses her utter disdain for Mr. Darcy and they almost kiss. The tension is unbearable but I completely adored every minute of it. To top it all off, this movie is so superbly filmed it makes other movies pale in comparison. The timing in every scene is impeccable and the precision is an absolute wonder to behold. This is now my all-time favorite movie. It is just indescribably beautiful.

The music lets you know right from the beginning that this is a love story/epic, and uses period-style melodies that draw you into the narrative. The attention to period detail hasn't been so impressive since Polanski's ""Tess"". And the acting couldn't be more pitch-perfect. Indeed, Keira Knightly was the headstrong yet vulnerable Lizzie, and Matt MacFadyen managed to get better looking as the film went on, to the point that it was almost a distraction. We are seeing Darcy through Lizzie's eyes. Wonderful supporting performances from Brenda Blethyn, Donald Sutherland, and a particularly bitchy Dame Judi Dench, as well as everyone else, certainly add to this most pleasurable film experience.

Last month my fiancee and I went to see the film, starring Keira Knightley and company.Any period piece film adaptation draws an inevitable comparison against its novel roots. I have to say that, for the most part, the film does well with its translation. I had been concerned with the casting of KK in the lead heroine role here, but she does a good job with the material, and the emotional range she conveys with her facial expressions rather caught my attention. The rest of the main cast are solid choices as well, and it is nice to see a fellow Canadian, Donald Sutherland, continuing to find work at his age! I was left wondering if Dame Judi's character was supposed to be so one-dimensional, as it has been a long time since I've read the book, but it's only a little nit, nothing more. Matthew MacFadyen, does an excellent job with Darcy, leading us to see a complex character from a distance, literally, as the characters' pride keeps the two main characters apart so often.My main complaint is with the ending. If the movie had ended with the novel's ending, it would have been perfect. The ""Hollywood ending"", with ""the big kiss"", sticks a dagger into the spirit of the times, and of the writing--romantic love was supposed to be implied, not shown. Not sure what the movie makers were thinking--did they think this would be a big box office draw? Ah well.I do recommend the movie though.

However, either I didn&#8217;t read it well or as a result of my failing memory I couldn&#8217;t recall what it was about.  I did, however, recognize the title as I clicked through the cable guide.  So, on a whim, I began watching it and shortly after the beginning I found myself captivated, frantically hitting the record button!I adore this 2005 interpretation of Jane Austen&#8217;s novel.  Keira Knightly is divine and Mathew MacFadyen as Mr. Darcy compliments her charming yet feisty portrayal of Miss Lizzie Bennet perfectly.Though previous renditions of Jane&#8217;s novel may be more faithful to the story line, the 2005 film boldly strays, offering a story deliciously saturated with laughter, riotous gaiety, humor and, of course, seething emotion.  I feel Jane herself would not have objected.  This version skillfully contrasts the grandeur and spectacle of Georgian England society through its display of the fictional estates of Netherfield, Rosings Park, and Pemberly to the earthy likes of Longbourn.

641004,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JOHI,Robert Moore,"[9, 12]","In the past week I have seen a movie that I thought I was going to love but ended up disliking and a movie that I thought I was going to dislike but found myself loving.  The former was BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, which I found physically beautiful to look at, but whose characters I found to be uninteresting and bland.  The latter was PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  The reason I thought that I was going to dislike it was the existence of an absolutely superb BBC mini-series, which seemed to me to be the last word on what could be done with Jane Austen's masterpiece.  I was wrong.  Not only is there room for a truly great six-hour television version but also for an excellent two-hour cinematic version.I still prefer the BBC version.  There are two reasons.  First, there probably will never be a better Mr. Darcy than Colin Firth.  Laurence Olivier might have had a shot in the 1940 Hollywood version, but that film was destroyed by an almost inconceivable rewriting of many of the key elements (the worst being making Lady Catherine de Bourgh into a matchmaker between Darcy and Elizabeth).  Matthew Macfadyen is an extremely capable Darcy, but it was as if Colin Firth were born to play the part.  The other advantage of the BBC production is time:  there is simply no way that a two-hour movie can do as good a job of adapting the novel as a six-hour production.  In watching the BBC version, one gets the sense that almost nothing of importance gets left out, whereas with the movie I found myself constantly regretting parts of the story that had of necessity to be left out.Nonetheless, there is no questioning the excellence of this new movie version.  Simply because the series does a fuller job of telling the story does not mean that this movie cannot excel in a shorter time span.  The film definitely feels abridged, yet one also feels that most (though certainly not all) of the most important bits have been retained.  With most adaptations of a novel this might not have been such a problem, but PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of the best known and beloved novels in the English language (I have read it five times, see the Garson-Olivier version twice, and the BBC version three times).  Given the time restrictions, I believe the movie did as good a job as is possible.The film does have some advantages over the television version.  First, it is remarkably gorgeous to look at.  Whether we are beholding household interiors or shots of the countryside, this film was a delight to behold.  Also, with the exception of Jena Malone as Lydia and the aforementioned Colin Firth, most of the performances in the film version are a bit stronger.  I wouldn't say Keira Knightly is better than Jennifer Ehle, but she is definitely a different Elizabeth.  Let's just acknowledge that both are superb.  I recently saw Kelly Reilly (actually, all of Kelly Reilly) in the wonderful MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS.  Here is plays Miss Bingley and does a fine job.  Rosamund Pike is excellent as Elizabeth's slightly more beautiful sister Jane.  Well, she isn't noticeably more attractive than Keira Knightly, but she'll do.  Two supporting performances stand out.  First, Tom Hollander was superb as a completely different kind of Mr. Collins.  In all other versions, Collins is presented as an utter buffoon.  In defense of previous versions, Mr. Collins is a buffoon in Austen's novel.  But it is nice to see him as slightly less absurd.  And Brenda Blethyn, one of the great actresses of her generation, manages to make Mrs. Bennett into more than merely a silly cartoon.  In his book ASPECTS OF THE NOVEL, E. M. Forster makes a distinction between flat and round characters and argues that Jane Austen loves to mix the two types.  His example of a flat character is Mrs. Bennett.  And while it remains true that Ms. Blethyn isn't able to transform her into a deep character, she does keep her from being the silly twit seen in previous versions.  The one other character that did not appreciably improve upon the BBC production was, surprisingly, Judi Dench's Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  Part of the problem is that most of her scenes were shot in a somewhat subdued manner; partly she obviously decided not to play the role as a broad character.Finally, the movie works in very large part because of the chemistry between Keira Knightly's Elizabeth and Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy.  Though one genuinely misses the many big scenes early in the story in the BBC production where Darcy's pride is made manifest and Elizabeth forms her prejudices, in the romantic portions they are great together.  Also, Knightly is one of the few actresses to play the part and be the age that Elizabeth is actually supposed to be.  All in all, they click onscreen.So, I guess this should be a lesson that you shouldn't prejudge a film.  You actually can be surprised.  In fact, in the past couple of months, the two films that I most enjoyed in the theater were two that I didn't expect to like, the other being KING KONG.  So I suppose this is a lesson previously learned that has now been reinforced.",5,A movie I loved that I truly expected to dislike,1140307200,"02 19, 2006",2006,5071,"['past', 'week', 'have', 'seen',

Davenport ""neurologyroger""","[5, 8]","I have now seen every filmed version of this, the Jane Austin masterpiece, and have loved almost every version, because no matter the actors, the love story, as it overcomes pride and replaces prejudice is eternal. The original film was the only big disappointment--but my father, who was an English teacher, loved it.  The ""insufferably noble Greer Garson"" as Pauline Kael called her looked more like Mrs. Bennet than Lizzie, but Sir Laurence Olivier certainly made a handsome if somewhat earnest Mr. Darcy.  In one BBC version, Judy Parfitt played the most imperious Lady Catherine and in the last BBC performance Colin Firth made men's and women's hearts beat as the truly inscrutible and mysterious Darcy.  However, this film has its own blessings.To begin with the Bennet household looks more like the eighteenth century truth of country living than the prettier versions.  Jane is truly vapid in appearance while sweet and trusting on an intimate basis and deserves the incredibly rich and awkward Bingley.  The other Bennet daughters are irritatingly silly and Brenda Blethyn is good--although I have seen more harried and neurotic performances.  But the Lizzie of Keira Knightley and the Darcy of Macfadyen are such that there can not be a dry seat in the house at the film's conclusion.  The impish nature of Knightley and the incredibly haughty disdain of Macfadyen make the final pairing something to long for, since it seems so unattainable.  Their youthful sexuality and the characters' cast iron personalities are lusty and appealing and their ""climax"" scene, in the pouring rain, in a verdant English garden is charged with emotion and longing--especially on the part of the viewer.  It should be pointed out that they are standing in a palladian ""folly"" in the garden which makes a delightful subtitle to their recognition scene.  Judy Dench chews up everything and everyone except Keira and is unfortunately denied some of her best lines when she has her final confrontation with Lizzie.  She would have delivered them in full throat throttle.  But these are insignificant notes to a beautiful production.  Lizzie and Darcy meeting on a foggy meadow is the stuff of romance and with these two actors the sexuality crackles like lightning.If you have seen the other versions of this film, please see this one to make the experience complete.  If you have never seen a version of this film, this is a great film to begin with--and then work your way backwards.  As for me and Jane Austin, Lizzie says it best when speaking of her obsequious cousin who is living on Lady Catherine's gifts: ""I am sure that her blessings could not have been bestowed on a more grateful subject.""",5,Never is there enough pride and prejudice,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",2007,2691,"['have', 'now', 'seen', 'filmed', 'version', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'masterpiece', 'have', 'loved', 'almost', 'version', 'matter', 'actors', 'love', 'story', 'pride', 'replaces', 'prejudice', 'eternal', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'big', 'disappointment', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'English', 'teacher', 'loved', 'insufferably', 'noble', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Pauline', 'Kael', 'called', 'looked', 'more', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'Lizzie', 'Sir', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'certainly', 'made', 'handsome', 'somewhat', 'earnest', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'one', 'BBC', 'version', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'played', 'most', 'imperious', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'last', 'BBC', 'performance', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'made', 'men', 'women', 'hearts', 'beat', 'truly', 'inscrutible', 'mysterious', 'Darcy', 'However', 'film', 'own', 'blessings.To', 'begin', 'Bennet', 'household', 'more', 'eighteenth', 'century', 'truth', 'country', 'living', 'prettier', 'versions', 'Jane', 'truly', 'vapid', 'appearance', 'sweet', 'trusting', 'intimate', 'basis', 'incredibly', 'rich', 'awkward', 'Bingley', 'other', 'Bennet', 'daughters', 'are', 'irritatingly', 'silly', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'good', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'harried', 'neurotic', 'performances', 'Lizzie', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Darcy', 'Macfadyen', 'are', 'such', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'dry', 'seat', 'house', 'film', 'conclusion', 'impish', 'nature', 'Knightley', 'incredibly', 'haughty', 'disdain', 'Macfadyen', 'make', 'final', 'pairing', 'something', 'long', 'so', 'unattainable', 'youthful', 'sexuality', 'characters', 'cast', 'iron', 'personalities', 'are', 'lusty', 'appealing', 'climax', 'scene', 'pouring', 'rain', 'verdant', 'English', 'garden', 'charged', 'emotion', 'longing', 'especially', 'part', 'viewer', 'should', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'standing', 'palladian', 'folly', 'garden', 'delightful', 'subtitle', 'recognition', 'scene', 'Judy', 'Dench', 'up', 'everything', 'everyone', 'Keira', 'unfortunately', 'denied', 'best', 'lines', 'when', 'final', 'confrontation', 'Lizzie', 'would', 'have', 'delivered', 'full', 'throat', 'throttle', 'are', 'insignificant', 'notes', 'beautiful', 'production', 'Lizzie', 'Darcy', 'meeting', 'foggy', 'meadow', 'stuff', 'romance', 'two', 'actors', 'sexuality', 'crackles', 'lightning.If', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'versions', 'film', 'please', 'see', 'one', 'make', 'experience', 'complete', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'version', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'begin', 'then', 'work', 'way', 'backwards', 'Jane', 'Austin', 'Lizzie', 'best', 'when', 'speaking', 'obsequious', 'cousin', 'who', 'living', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'gifts', 'am', 'sure', 'blessings', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'bestowed', 'more', 'grateful', 'subject']",N/A

And even though some of the versions have been quite good actually, one can still wonder if this glut is really all that necessary.  The book's two most recent incarnations came in the form of miniseries produced by the BBC, the first in 1980 and the second in 1995.  However, since 1940, there has not been a ""straight"" (i.e. set in the proper time period) version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" designed specifically for the big screen.  Well, now we have one, written by Deborah Moggach, directed by  Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley in the lead role.This latest version is distinguished from the earlier efforts primarily by its grittier, grimier and grungier depiction of life in early 19th Century rural England.  With its peeling paint and dusty furnishings, the film certainly has a less prettified and more lived-in look than we are accustomed to seeing in movies based on Austen works.  Yet, perhaps because we have been spoiled by the marathon lengths of those earlier miniseries, this film, at a mere two hours and seven minutes, feels hurried and rushed as it attempts to cope with Austen's complex tale of the five Bennett sisters and their mother's frantic efforts to marry them off.  We are moved so quickly through the story that some of the more subtle details of character and theme get lost along the way.  Still, it's quite remarkable just how much of the plot Moggach is able to cram into a little over two hours, so that even the staunchest of Austen purists will have little to complain about on that score.What they may have reason to complain about is the fact that the film fails to capture much of the unique humor that distinguishes the novel.  For the most part, the scenes are played much too seriously and ""straight,"" particularly those involving the odious Mr. Collins and the insufferably condescending Lady Catherine de Bourg, who together supply some of Austen's most bitingly witty commentary on the superficiality of England's class-conscious society.  Tom Hollander gives a spiritless, leaden performance as the sycophantic minister, and Judi Dench plays Lady Catherine as if she were taking a stab at Lady MacBeth instead.  The same goes for Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett, whose pivotal role as the droll, dry commentator on the absurd Mrs. Bennett's matrimonial obsessions seems to have been lost on the actor.  Matthew Macfadyen fails to make an impact as the haute Mr. Darcy, although Brenda Blethyn hits the right notes as the grating mother driven to despair at the prospect of her daughters ending up old maids.In the coveted role of the high-minded, strong willed and extremely judgmental Elizabeth Bennett - certainly the most brilliant and fully realized of all Austen's creations - Knightley clearly means well but doesn`t seem quite up to the task.  Her annoying giggle and epicene expression make her far too silly and modern to successfully portray the rational but often misguided 19th Century heroine Austen intended Elizabeth to be.Yet, despite all these weaknesses, ""Pride and Prejudice"" makes for a reasonably entertaining film, thanks, primarily, to the strength of the original source material and the liveliness of Wright's direction (the ball scenes are exceptionally well done).  The film moves quickly and does a decent job telling its story.  Perhaps if we didn't have better versions to compare it to, this ""Pride and Prejudice"" would stand up better on its own.  It's far from a failure, but watching this condensed version instead of the two BBC miniseries is a bit like reading the Cliff's Notes instead of the actual novel.  You may be able to get the general gist of the thing, but not that wonderful flavoring that makes the original so special.",3,gets the plot details right but misses much of the humor,1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,3908,"['***1/2It', 'time', 'turn', 'days', 'filmmaker', 'been', 'hard', 'work', 'producing', 'yet', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'most', 'beloved', 'novel', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'even', 'versions', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'good', 'actually', 'one', 'can', 'still', 'wonder', 'glut', 'really', 'necessary', 'book', 'two', 'most', 'recent', 'incarnations', 'came', 'form', 'miniseries', 'produced', 'BBC', 'first', '1980', 'second', '1995', 'However', '1940', 'not', 'been', 'straight', 'i.e', 'set', 'proper', 'time', 'period', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'designed', 'specifically', 'big', 'screen', 'Well', 'now', 'have', 'one', 'written', 'Deborah', 'Moggach', 'directed', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'starring', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'lead', 'role.This', 'latest', 'version', 'distinguished', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'primarily', 'grittier', 'grimier', 'grungier', 'depiction', 'life', 'early', '19th', 'Century', 'rural', 'England', 'peeling', 'paint', 'dusty', 'furnishings', 'film', 'certainly', 'less', 'prettified', 'more', 'lived-in', 'look', 'are', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'movies', 'based', 'Austen', 'works', 'perhaps', 'have', 'been', 'spoiled', 'marathon', 'lengths', 'earlier', 'miniseries', 'film', 'mere', 'two', 'hours', 'seven', 'minutes', 'feels', 'hurried', 'rushed', 'cope', 'Austen', 'complex', 'tale', 'five', 'Bennett', 'sisters', 'mother', 'frantic', 'efforts', 'marry', 'off', 'are', 'moved', 'so', 'quickly', 'story', 'more', 'subtle', 'details', 'character', 'theme', 'get', 'lost', 'way', 'Still', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'plot', 'Moggach', 'able', 'cram', 'little', 'two', 'hours', 'even', 'staunchest', 'Austen', 'purists', 'will', 'have', 'little', 'complain', 'score.What', 'may', 'have', 'reason', 'complain', 'fact', 'film', 'capture', 'much', 'unique', 'humor', 'novel', 'most', 'part', 'scenes', 'are', 'played', 'much', 'too', 'seriously', 'straight', 'particularly', 'involving', 'odious', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'insufferably', 'condescending', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourg', 'who', 'together', 'supply', 'Austen', 'most', 'bitingly', 'witty', 'commentary', 'superficiality', 'England', 'class-conscious', 'society', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'spiritless', 'leaden', 'performance', 'sycophantic', 'minister', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'were', 'taking', 'stab', 'Lady', 'MacBeth', 'instead', 'same', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Mr.', 'Bennett', 'pivotal', 'role', 'droll', 'dry', 'commentator', 'absurd', 'Mrs.', 'Bennett', 'matrimonial', 'obsessions', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'actor', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'make', 'impact', 'haute', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'right', 'notes', 'grating', 'mother', 'driven', 'despair', 'prospect', 'daughters', 'ending', 'up', 'old', 'maids.In', 'coveted', 'role', 'high-minded', 'strong', 'willed', 'extremely', 'judgmental', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'certainly', 'most', 'brilliant', 'fully', 'realized', 'Austen', 'creations', 'Knightley', 'clearly', 'well', 'doesn', 't', 'seem', 'quite', 'up', 'task', 'annoying', 'giggle', 'epicene', 'expression', 'make', 'far', 'too', 'silly', 'modern', 'successfully', 'portray', 'rational', 'often', 'misguided', '19th', 'Century', 'heroine', 'Austen', 'intended', 'Elizabeth', 'be.Yet', 'weaknesses', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'film', 'thanks', 'primarily', 'strength', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'liveliness', 'Wright', 'direction', 'ball', 'scenes', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'moves', 'quickly', 'decent', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'Perhaps', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'better', 'versions', 'compare', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'would', 'stand', 'up', 'better', 'own', 'far', 'failure', 'watching', 'condensed', 'version', 'instead', 'two', 'BBC', 'miniseries', 'bit', 'reading', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'instead', 'actual', 'novel', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'general', 'gist', 'thing', 'not', 'wonderful', 'flavoring', 'original', 'special']",N/A

641021,ANA2PVMARGY8H,B00005JOHI,"Sarah ""Bookworm/cat person""","[6, 8]","When a coworker told me that a new version of Pride & Prejudice was in the works, I took interest.  She then said that Keira Knightley would be in it.  I innocently asked, ""Who will she play?""  ""Elizabeth, of course.""  ""But,"" I protested, ""she's too pretty to play Elizabeth."" I was thinking that unless the screenwriter excises Darcy's offensive comments about Lizzie's looks, this casting choice would be unconvincing.  In the 1940 version (with Aldous Huxley as screenwriter), Darcy (Lawrence Olivier) says that he has no time to humor the middle classes, sparing Greer Garson the evaluation of being ""tolerable, but not handsome enough...""This movie has many great qualities. It is far ""earthier"" than the A&E;/BBC 1996 production, as swine roam both outside and inside the Bennet's house, and the characters look like they've worked up a good sweat at the country dances. I also like how much more tender Mr. Bennet's character is than in the book and other productions.  Granted this is an apocryphal character interpretation, but I really liked it just the same. Donald Sutherland's take on Mr. Bennet is one of his finest performances of my awareness. Instead of continuing to chide Mary that the other ladies need a chance to exhibit their musical talents, he comforts his sobbing daughter.  Another point that I liked is that the characters really look their age.  Though I love and still prefer the A&E;/BBC production, all of the Bennet girls were played by grown-up women well into their twenties and beyond.  In this production, Lydia does look like a 15-year-old girl and Lizzie like a girl who's not yet one and twenty (with four younger sisters out, your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own my age).Due to time constraints, this movie didn't get the opportunity to really fine-tune character development and relationships. The A&E; Adrain Lukis' Wickham was so dastardly charming, yet Lizzie's initial attraction to (Rupert Friend's) Wickham and later repulsion towards him was put on fast forward and barely developed due to the movie's two hour time frame. And the man who played Mr. Collins in the A&E; production was brilliant--he apparently was cast because he was the only actor who could keep a straight face while saying some of ""the most fatuous"" lines Jane Austen ever penned.

641025,A2MR44CIZR1IJ8,B00005JOHI,Scaramouche,"[55, 83]","The current version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" starring Keira Knightley is a travesty. Do not see it in a theater, buy it, rent it, or watch it on television. It was a waste of time and electricity to make, and will be a waste of your time to see.There was a full-length version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" filmed in 1995, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, that remains not only unsurpassed but unequaled. It is perfectly adapted, cast, directed, acted, costumed, filmed, and scored. It preserves not only Jane Austen's intent, but the dialogue she wrote. Buy it and watch it instead.When she starred in the 1995 film, Miss Ehle did not have the blandly ""beautiful"" features or skeletal body of a model. She was, nevertheless, captivating as Elizabeth Bennet. The beauty--spiritual, intellectual, and physical--of the character she portrays increases in our esteem as we get to know her, just as it does in Darcy's. Elizabeth, as written by Austen and portrayed by Jennifer Ehle, was a mature and fascinating young woman, not a giggly,  petulant teenager with an eating disorder.Keira Knightley looks desperately in need of nourishment, and the ""lollipop-head"" figure does not work for the character she is playing. It's hard to believe that a girl of Elizabeth Bennet's time, place, and social class could have grown up so emaciated, unless she had a tapeworm.And, finally, there are many, including prominent professional critics, who commend this adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" for its ""realistic"" portrayal of dirt, unkempt clothes and hair, farm animals wallowing in the living room, etc. In fact, it is not only historically unauthentic, it is false to Jane Austen. There were no such scenes of squalor included in the novel. To the contrary, Austen wrote a passage in which Elizabeth Bennet sets out on a long walk after a rain storm to visit her ailing sister, during which she soils the hem of her skirt with mud. This slight soiling results in a small amount of embarrassment for Elizabeth, who tries to let down her outer garment to hide it, and a great amount of derision behind her back by two nasty female residents of the house she is visiting. Had dirt and shabbiness been the norm in households like Elizabeth's at the time depicted, it is unlikely a little mud on the edge of a skirt would have attracted anyone's notice or rude commentary, and these events in the book would have made no sense. The fact that Austen wrote such a scene and had the characters behave as they do indicates that cleanliness and neatness of dress were normal and expected at that place and time, among that class of people.",1,Skip It,1137456000,"01 17, 2006",2006,2626,"['current', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'starring', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'travesty', 'Do', 'not', 'see', 'theater', 'buy', 'rent', 'watch', 'television', 'was', 'waste', 'time', 'electricity', 'make', 'will', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'see.There', 'was', 'full-length', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'filmed', '1995', 'starring', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'not', 'only', 'unsurpassed', 'unequaled', 'perfectly', 'adapted', 'cast', 'directed', 'acted', 'costumed', 'filmed', 'scored', 'not', 'only', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'intent', 'dialogue', 'wrote', 'Buy', 'watch', 'instead.When', 'starred', '1995', 'film', 'Miss', 'Ehle', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'blandly', 'beautiful', 'features', 'skeletal', 'body', 'model', 'was', 'nevertheless', 'captivating', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'beauty', 'spiritual', 'intellectual', 'physical', 'character', 'increases', 'esteem', 'get', 'know', 'just', 'Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'written', 'Austen', 'portrayed', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'was', 'mature', 'fascinating', 'young', 'woman', 'not', 'giggly', 'petulant', 'teenager', 'eating', 'disorder.Keira', 'Knightley', 'desperately', 'need', 'nourishment', 'lollipop-head', 'figure', 'not', 'work', 'character', 'playing', 'hard', 'believe', 'girl', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'time', 'place', 'social', 'class', 'could', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'so', 'emaciated', 'had', 'tapeworm.And', 'finally', 'are', 'many', 'including', 'prominent', 'professional', 'critics', 'who', 'commend', 'adaptation', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'dirt', 'unkempt', 'clothes', 'hair', 'farm', 'animals', 'wallowing', 'living', 'room', 'etc', 'fact', 'not', 'only', 'historically', 'unauthentic', 'false', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'were', 'such', 'scenes', 'squalor', 'included', 'novel', 'contrary', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'passage', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'out', 'long', 'walk', 'rain', 'storm', 'visit', 'ailing', 'sister', 'hem', 'skirt', 'mud', 'slight', 'soiling', 'results', 'small', 'amount', 'embarrassment', 'Elizabeth', 'who', 'let', 'down', 'outer', 'garment', 'hide', 'great', 'amount', 'derision', 'back', 'two', 'nasty', 'female', 'residents', 'house', 'visiting', 'Had', 'dirt', 'shabbiness', 'been', 'norm', 'households', 'Elizabeth', 'time', 'depicted', 'unlikely', 'little', 'mud', 'edge', 'skirt', 'would', 'have', 'attracted', 'anyone', 'notice', 'rude', 'commentary', 'events', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'fact', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'scene', 'had', 'characters', 'behave', 'do', 'indicates', 'cleanliness', 'neatness', 'dress', 'were', 'normal', 'expected', 'place', 'time', 'class', 'people']",N/A
641026,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JOHI,Scott Schiefelbein,"[5, 9]","How does one steal a movie that sees both Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench hit high notes as supporting characters?  Keira Knightley does it by (a) playing one of the best roles in Western literature in Elizabeth Bennett and (b) nailing it.This adaptation of Jane Austen's beloved ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a bit more scruffy (and therefore realistic) than its natural complement, Emma Thompson's adaptation of Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility.""  Everyone looks gorgeous, or course, but they also don't look like they had Hollywood hair stylists, either.  This helps the movie, as it underscores Austen's theme - England was a dangerous place for young ladies unable to get married.Indeed, just as with ""S&S;,"" marriage is the peril and promise for all the characters in the story.  Does a woman grab what she can and hope to make the best of it?  Or does she hold out for true love?  And what do two lovely parents (Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn) do when they are relatively poor and (gasp!) unconventional but have five daughters they need to send into wedlock?One is to be delighted when a rich young man rents the nearby manor and brings along his dark friend, Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen of ""MI-5"" fame).  Lizzie and Darcy fall for each other immediately, but are compelled by circumstance as well as Lizzie's pride and prejudice (you knew they'd turn up somewhere) to go through one of the greatest love stories of all time.This is a gorgeous, funny movie with several thrilling ball and dance scenes, and the camera quietly does yeoman's work as it wanders through chambers and down hallways to keep the large cast in play and the viewer well-grounded in the story.  Of course the camera also knew to linger often on Ms. Knightley's beauty just often enough!  But she is no mere adornment - this is an excellent acting performance worthy of watching on its own merits.  Watching Lizzie how head-to-head with the rich society dame who hates her (Dench) is worth the price of admission.I have not read ""P&P;,"" so I cannot respond in detail to those who complain that the filmmakers have rewritten the story somewhat.  All I would say is that there are plenty of other ""purist"" adaptations of this story as well as the book itself, and that judged on its own merits, this is one heck of a film.",5,Keira Knightley steals the show in wonderful adaptation,1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,2297,"['How', 'one', 'steal', 'movie', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'hit', 'high', 'notes', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'playing', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'Western', 'literature', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennett', 'b', 'nailing', 'it.This', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'beloved', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'bit', 'more', 'scruffy', 'therefore', 'realistic', 'natural', 'complement', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'adaptation', 'Austen', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Everyone', 'gorgeous', 'course', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'had', 'Hollywood', 'hair', 'stylists', 'either', 'movie', 'Austen', 'theme', 'England', 'was', 'dangerous', 'place', 'young', 'ladies', 'unable', 'get', 'married.Indeed', 'just', 'S', 'S', 'marriage', 'peril', 'promise', 'characters', 'story', 'woman', 'grab', 'what', 'can', 'hope', 'make', 'best', 'hold', 'out', 'true', 'love', 'what', 'do', 'two', 'lovely', 'parents', 'Sutherland', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'do', 'when', 'are', 'relatively', 'poor', 'gasp', 'unconventional', 'have', 'five', 'daughters', 'need', 'send', 'wedlock', 'One', 'be', 'delighted', 'when', 'rich', 'young', 'man', 'nearby', 'manor', 'dark', 'friend', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'MI-5', 'fame', 'Lizzie', 'Darcy', 'fall', 'other', 'immediately', 'are', 'compelled', 'circumstance', 'as', 'well', 'Lizzie', 'pride', 'prejudice', 'knew', ""'d"", 'turn', 'up', 'somewhere', 'go', 'one', 'greatest', 'love', 'stories', 'time.This', 'gorgeous', 'funny', 'movie', 'several', 'thrilling', 'ball', 'dance', 'scenes', 'camera', 'quietly', 'work', 'chambers', 'down', 'hallways', 'keep', 'large', 'cast', 'play', 'viewer', 'well-grounded', 'story', 'course', 'camera', 'also', 'knew', 'linger', 'often', 'Ms.', 'Knightley', 'beauty', 'just', 'often', 'enough', 'mere', 'adornment', 'excellent', 'acting', 'performance', 'worthy', 'watching', 'own', 'merits', 'Watching', 'Lizzie', 'how', 'head-to-head', 'rich', 'society', 'dame', 'who', 'Dench', 'price', 'admission.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'P', 'P', 'can', 'not', 'respond', 'detail', 'who', 'complain', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'rewritten', 'story', 'somewhat', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'purist', 'adaptations', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'book', 'judged', 'own', 'merits', 'one', 'heck', 'film']",N/A

The Bennet family is made to look excessively poor, grimy and shabby, and not portrayed as the gentlemen's family that they were. Kitty and Lydia were just foolishly, cartoonishly ridiculous, to the point of absurdity. The ball scenes were frenetic and overly crowded, again to the point of absurdity. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth was not likable in any part of the movie - her portrayal was too modern. The entire pace of the movie was too fast - the dialogue was so fast to the point of not being able to understand it at times (and I am not old and I watch British period dramas frequently and so am used to the language). Mr. Bingley seemed a buffoon, which he is not. Mr. Darcy was just never appealing. Their eventually romance seemed implausible.  The whole thing just seemed forced. Jane Austen's subtle humor was never fairly portrayed.It seemed like they wanted give these characters a modern feel while keeping them in early 19th century setting, and it just didn't work.

There is less of the frothy romaticising of the time and much more of gritty determination to represent the period and the evidence of class division. Equally, Austen's great wit and simmering sarcasm are brought to life more vividly. I have been given to be a little harsh about the artisitic ability of Keira Knightly in the past, but here she utterly redeems herself and shows a level of talent that is confidant and appealing. She injects into Elizabeth Bennett, the fiesty and forthright nature, out of tune with the requirements of her time, that I believe Austen intended her to have. The relationship between Knightly and Pike (Sisters Elizabeth and Jane) is girlish, affectionate and charming. Brenda Blethyn is perfectly dotty and anxst ridden as Mrs Bennett is intended to be and Donald Sutherland is world weiry whilst dotishly  parental.The simmering romance is evident and heartfelt and for all that people have long adored Firth's Darcy, Macfadyen injects this awkward and snobbish, cold-fish with a sense of heartbreaking tenderness and vulnerability not before seen; and it is all the better for it.Dench is utterly and obnoxiuosly brilliant and the Grand and Judgemental de Borg.

Although Jane Austen's original work was not the best, this movie is the epitome of monotony.  Nothing interesting happens at all.  It is essentially one of the most generic and boring styles of cinema: a love story with no twists and no added elements of suspense or uncertainty.  Again, Hollywood fails to do anything more than reprint a book on screen and bore us all to death in the process.  Make no mistake:  the book itself had many flaws, and though considered a classic work of literature, it was incredibly slow-paced and left the reader searching frantically for adrenaline to keep his or her heart beating.  Nevertheless the movie falls into this trap in a far worse way than the book; by the end, you seriously wonder what happened to the last two hours of your life.  The conclusion is unfulfilling at best.  You know precisely what will happen from about twenty minutes in, and it never changes.  No surprises whatsoever.  Even by today's low standards for cinema, this is pathetic.  I honestly cannot see why anyone would want to see this movie, and I've been pondering the positive reviews on amazon.com for hours.

641034,AC744LW4D4U9G,B00005JOHI,Shemogue,"[8, 9]","I've seen all the filmed versions of Pride & Prejudice, and found each one to be enjoyable in its own unique way.There is no reason to remake a film if it is going to be exactly like the one before, and with this latest version of  P&P;, director Joe Wright, who is quite a young man, was obviously unwilling to create just another clone. Instead he has chosen to shock us a little by his attention to realism in the settings and activities surrounding the characters - using social documentary, circa 1797, to emphasize the differences in social status of the family groups in the story.I particularly like the scene where the Bennet ladies visit Netherfield when Jane is sick.  They all sit on the sofa in their best, but dated ""provincial"" Georgian clothes, while Caroline Bingley is dressed in the height of fashion in an elegant high-waisted Empire gown.Life in an English country manor 200 years ago was far from palatial. Even Great Houses were dark and drafty and often dirty.  There was no indoor plumbing, electricity, washing machines, drycleaning, cooking ranges, refrigeration, vacuum cleaners, or central heating. Fireplaces smoked, floors creaked; roofs leaked; water and wood and coal was carried in; ashes and slops were carried out. Livestock was everywhere and flies followed them. There were not even any commercial soaps or cleaning materials - you had to make your own from caustic chemicals.  New furnishings, drapery and carpets were expensive, and hand-me-downs were valued, even if threadbare and faded.Austen mentions only 2 indoor servants at Longbourn - the cook and Hill, the maid of all work, and both would have worked long hours. The daughters would have had to make up the slack, although Mrs Bennet makes it clear cooking was beneath them.  Even the family's riding horses must do double duty on the farm. Life at Longbourn would not have been up to the standards of Rosings and Pemberley, which though they were palaces, would have suffered the same housekeeping difficulties as Longbourn -  but would have more servants to throw at the problems.Jane Austen devoted few words to descriptions of houses and housekeeping. She expected her readers would be familiar with life in various social milieus. We have been reading between the lines, and our reading has not always been accurate, if one is to judge from the disappointed comments of some viewers.This version will never replace the earlier versions, but it does add another point of view, as the film ""Clueless"" did for ""Emma"". Wright has taken some liberties with the characters, making Mrs Bennet more sympathetic.  I found the dialogue was rather mumbled, but,like most Janeites, I  know it  by heart so it didn't matter very much.  I expect the film's biggest audience will be Janeites who already know the story & appreciate a fresh look at it.  Just think of all those versions of Shakespeare's plays & no one has got tired of doing another after 400 years.",4,social history circa 1797,1171411200,"02 14, 2007",2007,2955,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'filmed', 'versions', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'found', 'one', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'own', 'unique', 'reason', 'remake', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'exactly', 'one', 'before', 'latest', 'version', 'P', 'P', 'director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'who', 'quite', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'obviously', 'unwilling', 'create', 'just', 'clone', 'Instead', 'chosen', 'shock', 'little', 'attention', 'realism', 'settings', 'activities', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'using', 'social', 'documentary', 'circa', '1797', 'emphasize', 'differences', 'social', 'status', 'family', 'groups', 'story.I', 'particularly', 'scene', 'where', 'Bennet', 'ladies', 'visit', 'Netherfield', 'when', 'Jane', 'sick', 'sit', 'sofa', 'best', 'dated', 'provincial', 'Georgian', 'clothes', 'Caroline', 'Bingley', 'dressed', 'height', 'fashion', 'elegant', 'high-waisted', 'Empire', 'gown.Life', 'English', 'country', 'manor', '200', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'far', 'palatial', 'Even', 'Great', 'Houses', 'were', 'dark', 'drafty', 'often', 'dirty', 'was', 'indoor', 'plumbing', 'electricity', 'washing', 'machines', 'drycleaning', 'cooking', 'ranges', 'refrigeration', 'vacuum', 'cleaners', 'central', 'heating', 'Fireplaces', 'smoked', 'floors', 'creaked', 'roofs', 'leaked', 'water', 'wood', 'coal', 'was', 'carried', 'ashes', 'slops', 'were', 'carried', 'out', 'Livestock', 'was', 'everywhere', 'flies', 'followed', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'commercial', 'soaps', 'cleaning', 'materials', 'had', 'make', 'own', 'caustic', 'chemicals', 'New', 'furnishings', 'drapery', 'carpets', 'were', 'expensive', 'hand-me-downs', 'were', 'valued', 'even', 'threadbare', 'faded.Austen', 'mentions', 'only', '2', 'indoor', 'servants', 'Longbourn', 'cook', 'Hill', 'maid', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'long', 'hours', 'daughters', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'make', 'up', 'slack', 'Mrs', 'Bennet', 'clear', 'cooking', 'was', 'Even', 'family', 'riding', 'horses', 'must', 'do', 'double', 'duty', 'farm', 'Life', 'Longbourn', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'up', 'standards', 'Rosings', 'Pemberley', 'were', 'palaces', 'would', 'have', 'suffered', 'same', 'housekeeping', 'difficulties', 'Longbourn', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'servants', 'throw', 'problems.Jane', 'Austen', 'devoted', 'few', 'words', 'descriptions', 'houses', 'housekeeping', 'expected', 'readers', 'would', 'be', 'familiar', 'life', 'various', 'social', 'milieus', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'lines', 'reading', 'not', 'always', 'been', 'accurate', 'one', 'judge', 'disappointed', 'comments', 'viewers.This', 'version', 'will', 'never', 'replace', 'earlier', 'versions', 'add', 'point', 'view', 'film', 'Clueless', 'did', 'Emma', 'Wright', 'taken', 'liberties', 'characters', 'making', 'Mrs', 'Bennet', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'found', 'dialogue', 'was', 'rather', 'mumbled', 'most', 'Janeites', 'know', 'heart', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'very', 'much', 'expect', 'film', 'biggest', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'Janeites', 'who', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'appreciate', 'fresh', 'look', 'Just', 'think', 'versions', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'one', 'got', 'tired', 'doing', '400', 'years']",N/A

The sets were awe inspiring. And that sunset scene at the end--oh my, was so glorious.Macfadyen is simply breathtaking as Mr. Darcy. He is easy on the eyes. One thing I loved is that he seemed to really show, by way of his mannerisms, Mr. Darcy's awkwardness and insecurities. When he grabs Elizabeth's hand, that first instant of skin to skin contact, his reaction is heartwarming. In another instance, when he enters the room and surprises Elizabeth, the way he just played with his gloves was amazing and it really gave you insight as to what Mr. Darcy was feeling at the moment. Colin Firth was exceptional as Mr. Darcy but Macfadyen gave him a good run for his money.Kiera did a nice job as Elizabeth. A wonderful effort on her part.All in all, the film was a fine effort.

It has to be one of the most watched sets of DVDs in my collection.That said, I was expecting to go into this movie and be disappointed. I mean, it was hard enough to adapt the novel into a nearly 6 hour mini series. How in the world would they get it down to 2 hours and 7 minutes? Would it be Jane Austen on speed?I must say, though I was not thoroughly pleased (though I expected I would not be), I was most certainly not disappointed either! :o) All the acting was well done. It was interesting to see different takes on the Bennett girls. After time, I adjust to Keira Knightley's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett. McFadden wasn't broody enough in my opinion.

641042,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,B00005JOHI,Silver Screen,"[7, 11]","The most recent rendering of Jane Austen's masterpiece ""Pride and Prejudice"" is not the A&E; version that I own and adore, but it stands well on its own.I'll admit, being a Colin Firth as Darcy fan, and a huge fan of the A&E; version, I was prepared to dislike this movie, and dislike it intensely.  While it was not as good as the A&E; version, I did enjoy the film.My biggest problems?  First, and perhaps most importantly, the length.  A&E; did a five hour masterpiece, with wonderful character interpretations, dialogue and a general overview of Austen's cultures and times.  This version, coming in at 2 hours, requires certain characters and plotlines to be abbreviated, or left out entirely.  Which leads to problem number two.  Lizzy's Uncle and Aunt Gardiner are barely represented here, although they play a huge role in the book (and the A&E; version).  Bingham's sister and brother-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Hurst, have been axed.  Caroline Bingley has few scenes.  We never see her meeting up with Jane in London.  Mr. Collins and Charlotte have very few scenes. You are not left with the impression that Charlotte and Lizzy are good friends, but maybe just acquaintances.  Lady Catherine de Burgh (played wonderfully icy by Judi Dench)appears in perhaps two scenes.The Bennets themselves, with the exception of Mr. Bennet, are woefully underrepresented.  Despite the loveliness of the actress playing her, you don't get a sense of Jane's modesty, shyness and affection for Bingley.  You also don't get a sense of the close bond that Lizzy and Jane shared.  Mrs. Bennet in this version lacks the hysterics and dramatics that the A&E; Mrs. Bennet possessed - - to the detriment of this film, in my opinion.  Mary, Kitty and Lydia seemed to be simply secondary characters, at least until Lydia runs away with Wickham . . but even then, the viewer may not have the impression of what a huge lout Wickham is, nor how precocious Lydia was.  All in all, having to tell such a beloved love story, with so many characters, is a daunting task, but a very difficult one in two hours or less.  As a result, this version feels rushed - - there is no feeling that nearly a year has passed since Bingley has seen Jane, or since Darcy and Lizzy first met.Now, what is good about this version?  The two lead actors are wonderfully endearing.  No, Keira Knightly is not Jennifer Ehle and Matthew MacFadeyn is not Colin Firth.  But they are very sweet together and have definite chemistry.  When I heard that Knightley was cast as my favorite literary character, originally, I was horrified.  But I have to say that she does a very credible job.

641047,A26A64X86VL1R4,B00005JOHI,Snowbrocade,"[12, 17]","Pride and Prejudice is an old favorite of mine.  Austen has a knack for writing about relationships.  There is a fine subterranean stream of masked sexuality contrasting with the formal social necessities of her era that create a wonderful tension in her novels.  The director picked up on this element and created a wonderful movie.Pride and Prejudice was gorgeously and authentically filmed.  The period was pre-regency--in the early Napoleonic wars--one not so commonly portrayed. The men pose in outfits that evoke some of the portraits of Napoleon.  All of the locations are stunning making the most of ancient trees and beautiful mansions.The film portrayed the ramifications of what it meant to be the daughters of poor gentry in this era.  The girls simply must marry in order to survive.  Yet they were looked down upon for their aspirations to marry well.  Also, their lower social status made them prey to men who might exploit these women for sex.  In most cases marriages were simply financial transactions--merging of assets.Matt McFayden was the perfect choice to play the proud man who is humbled by his love for a woman impossible for him to marry because she is not in his social class.  When he decides that his love for her is so great he cannot be without her, his pride and a series of misunderstandings cause Lizzy (Keira Knightly) to reject him. McFayden and Knightly play the star-crossed lovers with the restrained intensity called for by the social manners of the time. In particular McFayden is devastating as the heart-broken lover.This movie succeeded visually, as a psychological portrait of a social era and most importantly as a great romance.",5,"Hot and sexy, in a mannered English drawing room style!",1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,1676,"['Pride', 'Prejudice', 'old', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Austen', 'knack', 'writing', 'relationships', 'fine', 'subterranean', 'stream', 'masked', 'sexuality', 'contrasting', 'formal', 'social', 'necessities', 'era', 'create', 'wonderful', 'tension', 'novels', 'director', 'picked', 'up', 'element', 'created', 'wonderful', 'movie.Pride', 'Prejudice', 'was', 'gorgeously', 'authentically', 'filmed', 'period', 'was', 'pre-regency', 'early', 'Napoleonic', 'wars', 'one', 'not', 'so', 'commonly', 'portrayed', 'men', 'pose', 'outfits', 'evoke', 'portraits', 'Napoleon', 'locations', 'are', 'stunning', 'making', 'most', 'ancient', 'trees', 'beautiful', 'mansions.The', 'film', 'portrayed', 'ramifications', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'daughters', 'poor', 'gentry', 'era', 'girls', 'simply', 'must', 'marry', 'order', 'survive', 'were', 'looked', 'down', 'aspirations', 'marry', 'well', 'Also', 'lower', 'social', 'status', 'made', 'prey', 'men', 'who', 'might', 'exploit', 'women', 'sex', 'most', 'cases', 'marriages', 'were', 'simply', 'financial', 'transactions', 'merging', 'assets.Matt', 'McFayden', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'play', 'proud', 'man', 'who', 'humbled', 'love', 'woman', 'impossible', 'marry', 'not', 'social', 'class', 'When', 'love', 'so', 'great', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'pride', 'series', 'misunderstandings', 'cause', 'Lizzy', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'reject', 'McFayden', 'Knightly', 'play', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'restrained', 'intensity', 'called', 'social', 'manners', 'time', 'particular', 'McFayden', 'devastating', 'heart-broken', 'lover.This', 'movie', 'succeeded', 'visually', 'psychological', 'portrait', 'social', 'era', 'most', 'importantly', 'great', 'romance']",N/A

On the other hand the fact that it is shorter in length makes it much more feasible for the hundreds of viewings I have endured blissfully.However in nearly every other category I prefer this rendition. I honestly find very little fault in absolutely anything in this movie. The principle actors portray each of their characters in the most beautiful, poetic manor. Particularly I adore Simon Woods as the nave Mr. Bingley, his eyes sparkle and I find myself believing every little word he speaks.Joe Wright did the most admirable job directing such a fantastic film, finding romance and tension in the smallest of actions between Elizabeth and Darcy. When Darcy offers his hand to help Elizabeth into the carriage, the moment is just breathtaking. Not to mention the cinematography and scenery are gorgeous scene after scene.Movie aside, the soundtrack encompasses some of the most beautiful music I could imagine; Most of the tracks by Jean-Yves Thibaudet are in high rotation on my itunes, my personal favorite being `Liz on top of the World.'.It's surreal.

Keira Knightley is mesmerizing as Eliza Bennett and I look forward to seeing a lot more of her work in the future.I also loved Matthew McFayden as Mr Darcy,Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennett, and Rosamund Pike captured the very essence of Jane Bennett, the eldest of the Bennett daughters.Dame Judi Dench gave a good performance as the interfering Lady Catherine De Bourg but Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet left me wondering at both his characterization - dirty unkempt hair and slovenly appearance - and how this portrayal in any way came even close to the witty,intelligent and amusing Mr Bennett of Jane Austens creation.At present, Director Joe Wright has teamed up again with Keira Knightley and Belinda Blethyn to make Atonement and I hope his ability to transfer a fine novel to the screen is more successful this time around.Pride and Predujice is so perfectly written, so precisely mapped out by Miss Austen, that any change is noticeable and the changes in story line are NEVER an improvement on the original.The wonder of classics like the books of Austen,the Bronte sisters, Thomas Hardy, George Elliot,is that they teach one about the lives of people in another century, the houses,the customs,the language, the fashion of the day and so forth.So efforts to update or ""modernise"" should be kept to a minimum.I enjoyed the latest P&P; version, but as a film, not as an adaptation of Jane Austens finest work.",3,Keira Knightly - Captivating as Eliza Bennett.,1170288000,"02 1, 2007",2007,1727,"['was', 'surprised', 'when', 'version', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'released', 'magnificent', 'BBC', 'mini', 'series', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'try', 'match', 'unmatchable', 'so', 'soon.However', 'supposed', 'be', 'review', 'latest', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', ""'d"", 'better', 'get', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'mesmerizing', 'Eliza', 'Bennett', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'lot', 'more', 'work', 'future.I', 'also', 'loved', 'Matthew', 'McFayden', 'Mr', 'Darcy', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Mrs', 'Bennett', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'captured', 'very', 'essence', 'Jane', 'Bennett', 'eldest', 'Bennett', 'daughters.Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'gave', 'good', 'performance', 'interfering', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'De', 'Bourg', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Mr', 'Bennet', 'left', 'wondering', 'characterization', 'dirty', 'unkempt', 'hair', 'slovenly', 'appearance', 'how', 'portrayal', 'way', 'came', 'even', 'close', 'witty', 'intelligent', 'amusing', 'Mr', 'Bennett', 'Jane', 'Austens', 'creation.At', 'present', 'Director', 'Joe', 'Wright', 'teamed', 'up', 'again', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'Belinda', 'Blethyn', 'make', 'Atonement', 'hope', 'ability', 'transfer', 'fine', 'novel', 'screen', 'more', 'successful', 'time', 'around.Pride', 'Predujice', 'so', 'perfectly', 'written', 'so', 'precisely', 'mapped', 'out', 'Miss', 'Austen', 'change', 'noticeable', 'changes', 'story', 'line', 'are', 'NEVER', 'improvement', 'original.The', 'wonder', 'classics', 'books', 'Austen', 'Bronte', 'sisters', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'George', 'Elliot', 'teach', 'one', 'lives', 'people', 'century', 'houses', 'customs', 'language', 'fashion', 'day', 'so', 'forth.So', 'efforts', 'update', 'modernise', 'should', 'be', 'kept', 'minimum.I', 'enjoyed', 'latest', 'P', 'P', 'version', 'film', 'not', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austens', 'finest', 'work']",N/A

It's been done many times, and quite well (BBC miniseries and the Greer Garson, Laurence Olivier versions stand out).  Cynically, I thought this is just another Hollywood grab for some sure dollars.However, I found this version to be refreshing and inspired.  Many people have commented on the youthfulness of the characters, the transposition to more rural as opposed to drawing room settings, and the more unrestrained atmosphere, as opposed to the buttoned-up proto-Victorian image of versions past.However, what I liked about it, was that it had a very clear grasp of the central relationship between Darcy and Lizzy, from the first attractions of their mutual chemistry, to the unfolding and appreciation of their respective characters.  In other hands, the attraction between the two would have been unfathomable, particularly where the dialogue is harsh, but Keira Knightley does a great job conveying the conflict between her head and heart, and the scenes between the two lovers are charged with enough emotion to thrill the heart of any romantic.Because of the intense focus on the central relationship, the other characters sort of fade into the background, and I don't think Mr. or Mrs. Bennett are done as well as in some other versions.  However, Collins and ""his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourg"" are done very well, and the last interview between Lizzie and Lady Catherine is re-cast very well, and is more coherent.In other words, I think this wasn't just made to make a buck, but made from a sense of trying to draw out some of the themes and relationships and show the characters in a fresh light.I was enchanted.

641058,AGRR05FH945HR,B00005JOHI,Steven Cain,"[6, 11]","I think not. Nor, is he in fact, dead. I loved his masterful portrayal of Darcy, as I have loved everything he does, including Love Actually, but it did not prevent me from devouring this gorgeous adaptation.To me, Knightley was a revelation, and this beautifully crafted adaptation is a showcase for her genuine versatility. When you can hold your own against a goddess of stage and screen such as Dame Judi Dench, you've got something going on. Likewise, in her beautiful interaction with a superb Donald Sutherland, when she is speaking to him about Darcy's marriage proposal. Both actors are just stunning.I love this version equally with the Colin Version, and everything from the cinematography to the casting, production and direction all conspire to make this movie a delight for the senses. Being a fan of solo piano, I also loved the soundtrack (Dario Marianelli), especially the exquisite cascading ripples of pieces such as Liz On Top Of The World.At the heart of this delicious interpretation is Austen's disturbing portrayal of the sheer madness of a blinkered patriarchal society in which females, even brilliant, beautiful and gifted females, could never inherit property. Brenda Blethyn's delightful performance as a mother anxious to get her divine daughters married off, is based on this shameful reality.Even though I had heard many good things about the Knightley Version, it actually exceeded my expectations by a quantum factor, and I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.",5,Colin Firth... rolling in his grave?,1159747200,"10 2, 2006",2006,1498,"['think', 'not', 'fact', 'dead', 'loved', 'masterful', 'portrayal', 'Darcy', 'have', 'loved', 'everything', 'including', 'Love', 'Actually', 'did', 'not', 'prevent', 'devouring', 'gorgeous', 'Knightley', 'was', 'revelation', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'adaptation', 'showcase', 'genuine', 'versatility', 'When', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'goddess', 'stage', 'screen', 'such', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', ""'ve"", 'got', 'something', 'going', 'Likewise', 'beautiful', 'interaction', 'superb', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'when', 'speaking', 'Darcy', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'actors', 'are', 'just', 'stunning.I', 'love', 'version', 'equally', 'Colin', 'Version', 'everything', 'cinematography', 'casting', 'production', 'direction', 'conspire', 'make', 'movie', 'delight', 'senses', 'Being', 'fan', 'solo', 'piano', 'also', 'loved', 'soundtrack', 'Dario', 'Marianelli', 'especially', 'exquisite', 'cascading', 'ripples', 'pieces', 'such', 'Liz', 'Top', 'World.At', 'heart', 'delicious', 'interpretation', 'Austen', 'disturbing', 'portrayal', 'sheer', 'madness', 'blinkered', 'patriarchal', 'society', 'females', 'even', 'brilliant', 'beautiful', 'gifted', 'females', 'could', 'never', 'inherit', 'property', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'delightful', 'performance', 'mother', 'anxious', 'get', 'divine', 'daughters', 'married', 'off', 'based', 'shameful', 'reality.Even', 'had', 'heard', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'Knightley', 'Version', 'actually', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'quantum', 'factor', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'highly', 'enough']",N/A

641060,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B00005JOHI,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[28, 38]","I am not worthy of writing a review of this film, but I MUST try.It seems like only yesterday Codemaster Talon (my genius sister and fellow Amazon reviewer) and myself were sitting in a darkened theater watching previews before some film or other, and saw a fleeting glimpse of yet another Jane Austin inspired film. That was my initial reaction, ""Oh no, not ANOTHER one..."". And yet, within that short time I was intrigued. The acting looking competent, and the cinematography absolutely breath-taking. ""I'll see it for the cinematography alone,"" I commented to my companion.Now I don't pretend to be half the Jane Austin fan that Codemaster Talon is. I don't pretend to be some kind of literary higher critic or the absolute authority on historical accuracy and proper period acting. I do however, know a good story when I see one. Pride and Prejudice as a story in all it's versions holds a very special place in my heart. You see at it's core it is the story of two very similar personality types who are monstrously incompatible on the surface, and perfect compliments deep down.Elizabeth Bennet is an introvert who acts the extrovert, a whimsical person who is practical deep down, a genius who cares more about her friends' happiness than impressing others, and wishes for true love more than riches. She's a young woman who uses her feelings to deal with the world but most treasures her intuition. Darcy is a person who has all his feelings buried deep down. He's an introvert who keeps to himself unless compelled to action. He's logical and analytical, but treasures his feelings above all. He's blunt with his feelings, because so few people understand them. He's arrogant and proud, but courageous, and noble. In short he's the exact opposite of Elizabeth in every way save one. They are both people who live in their own universe separate from the rest of the world. And they are both VERY stubborn and judgmental.I've seen the old version of this story with Sir Laurence Olivier as Darcy and Greer Garson as Elizabeth. I've seen the gold-standard A&E; version which caused such an uproar with it's amazing dialog and acting. I have never seen anything like this. Never before has the true heart and soul of Liz and Darcy been on display. Never before could I see clearly expressed WHY  they fell in love with each other. In fact, never before could I see a real sign that they HAD fallen in love with each other. Now I see it.A movie is more than just acting with some music and sound effects tossed in, captured through a hand-held camera (despite what Indy film buffs may have told you). A real movie uses the acting to further the dialog, the dialog to further the action, the music to further the moment captured by the lens. Everything pushes  to express feelings and emotions that grab a hold of you and don't let go. I mentioned that the preview for this movie intrigued me because of the cinematography, but I had NO IDEA what was yet to come.Painting with Color, Drawing with LightThe title of this movie appears in a ray of sunlight. The first few minutes take us inside of the Bennet house with a genius that reminded me of the camera-work of The Magnificent Ambersons' greatest shot. And it only gets better. This is not showy camera-work for it's own sake. Everything has a point in this movie. Those opening minutes told multiple stories at once. Those first time I saw this movie beginning made me think first of the  standing of the household (as the lived-in and somewhat decayed nature of the estate was quite apparent), then of the personality of the main character (carrying a book and inside her own world despite all the hustle and bustle around her), and then of the personality of everyone else inside the house, as each person's body language, voice and activity summarized their personality in a snapshot.As the film progressed I witnessed a country party quite unlike anything I've seen in a Jane Austin film before. The party was lively and ecstatic and looked like FUN. And when Darcy and his friend came to the party we could quite quickly see how everyone else was a country bumpkin compared to them (something that was never so clear to me before). More than that, again the use of camera angles and body language spoke beyond the dialog to hint at things unsaid. ""Interesting,"" I thought. ""This movie is going to be interesting."" Then came the first scene where I honestly was mentally agasp with the question ""How did they do that?"". Liz and Jane are having a sister-to-sister conversation under the bed covers late at night and the perspective of the camera is the the arm of one sister, then it switches back to the other sister's perspective. ""Where's the camera?"", was all I could think. Not good camera use, GREAT.There were three moments in this film that  took my breath away (and while it was certainly impressive and added enormously to the picture, the dance between Darcy and Elizabeth where everyone else disappears {an effect executed marvelously here} is not one of them). The moments were these:The ProposalFirstly, Darcy's famous proposal. Normally portrayed somewhat arrogantly on Darcy's part, here it is played with passion, and we can see his heartache. Nay, we can FEEL his heartache. The whole scene happens in the rain, outdoors, with Liz and Darcy starting somewhat apart, and, as he proposes and she rejects him with more and more fury, they gradually get closer and closer until by the end of the scene their faces are nearly touching. I could FEEL the magnetism between the characters. I could SEE for the first time, that it was not HIM that she was rejecting (though she thought she was) but his ACTIONS. Despite her words, she was clearly drawn to him, absorbed in his personality. Though for so long she acted indifferent toward him, seemingly not caring, she was in fact almost obsessed with him. Yeah, I got all that from one scene.On top of the WorldOkay, this was it, the moment when I knew that I didn't just like this movie, I had fallen head-over-heels-in-love! While there are many splendid moments of wide-screen wide-angle shots (YES!), and some super-nice super-close-ups (the beauty is almost too much for my eyes!), this scene truly takes the cake. It starts with Lizzy in a carriage, the camera  on her eyes as sunlight and shadow dance across them. Then, the camera cuts to a STUNNING  shot of Elizabeth standing at the edge of a cliff with the wind blowing against her. The music swells and... GOODNESS. I'm glad I have ears and eyes and life within me to witness spectacles like this.Your Hands Are Cold.I've always loved Darcy as a character, for the same reason I loved Colonel Brandon in Sense and Sensibility. To me he's always been a hero, a great man just waiting for a chance to prove his strength and courage. This is perhaps the most powerful scene of the movie. After a terrible confrontation with the Lady Catherine, Lizzy gets up early in the cold morning and walks out into the hills. Just as the sun is coming up, who appears but Darcy, walking up with his jacket billowing in the wind like a hero's cape, sad, noble, and with depth of emotion to bring you to tears. It's like a hero coming back from a war. As he and Lizzy talk, they draw close together just as the sun is coming up between the two of them. That's what I live for. It's a moment that's so romantic and larger than life that it belongs alongside the greatest from Gone With the Wind and Casablanca. I don't know what else to say.The FilmWhat can I say about the acting of this film? For the first time in ages I forgot I was watching ACTORS and felt like I was watching a story unfold in front of me. I haven't felt this way since I was a kid. I forgot anyone was acting. For the most part, the characters in the film simply WERE. In other words, I smell Academy Awards.Knightley's Elizabeth is sharp, sensitive, sweet, and strong, a fully fleshed out acting job that simply makes us believe she IS the character. Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy is so sincere, so from the heart, that we cannot for one moment doubt his sincerity. He brings new depth to a new interpretation of a classic character. Rosamund Pike's Jane is simply overflowing with sweetness and good nature (and the scene of her leaving to pursue her love in the back of a carriage is feminine beauty personified). Even the so often portrayed as unbearably oily Mr. Collins gets a new spin as played by Tom Hollander. I actually felt SORRY for the guy a few times (trapped as he is in his own ridiculous world and never realizing how absolutely pathetic and silly he seems). Also wonderfully done are the Bennet parents played by Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland. Mrs. Bennet comes across more as a misunderstood sweet parent than a hyper-annoying flibbertigibbet. And Mr. Bennet just has more emotional resonance than in any previous version I've ever seen. Just about everyone is perfectly played in this movie.The music is sparing, but used to great effect. Never overwhelming the action, but rather pushing it, the soundtrack is quite good (I have it). There are moments of supreme beauty to be heard, but on the whole the soundtrack is rather sparse (comes to little more than half an hour).Some reviewers on the Net said that this production was by-the-numbers. I can understand that...if you happen to be color-blind, tone-deaf, and wouldn't know a good script if it smacked you upside the head. This film deserves to sweep the Oscars in every category. So perfect is the camera-work ( I have seen nothing like it since the days of Ford, Cardiff and Kurosawa), the score (heart-breaking), the acting (I love ALL the characters), and the script (it reaches straight into your heart) that EVERYONE should enjoy this film. Like the story that inspired it, it is a perfect marriage of the Male and Female personalities combining the Epic feel and strength of a man's film with the delicacy, beauty, and wit of a woman's film. I had thought long ago that the two great miracles of film-making would be to make the ordinary seem Epic, or the Epic seem ordinary. This film makes the ordinary, the lives and loves of people, into something as Epic as the end of the world or the blazing of new frontiers. I for one shall never be the same. After seeing this film I look at the world in a different way, and perhaps always shall.If this movie has one major flaw it is this: it is FAR too short at 2 hours. This is simply too big a story with too many characters to tell in that short a time. As such a lot of things things had to be spelled-out, and entire scenes and characters got the chopping block. And another reason I wish it were longer: I enjoyed every moment of this film so much I never wanted it to end.  My first words at as the end credits rolled were something like ""I can't wait for the director's cut."" You could wait for it to come out on DVD, but then you'd have to buy a big-screen TV and a surround-sound system to experience it's full glory. And to see this one on pan-and-scan would be to cut it's head off with a guillotine. In short, THIS is the film that EVERYONE has been waiting for.I tried to write a review. I really did. Words failed me. Please see this film in the theater.

The story of a family whose English countryside home and property must pass to the next male heir, just rubs me the wrong way.  There are five daughters in the family, and the mother's goal is to get them all married off advantageously (in case her husband drops dead and they are all kicked out).  I don't remember all the chickens, pigs and goats being all around the house, nor the wash hung on the line. Of course none of the girls, mother or father had to do a lick of work, they had servants for that...the father thanked one of them once for serving the food.  One maid hums as she passes out the clean laundry, so we're supposed to infer that as servants, they were content with their lot in life.Kiera Knightly plays Lizzie Bennet, who is supposed to be not very attractive, but very intelligent and witty. This is not convincing.  Ms. Knightly displayed a disturbing habit of wrinkling her nose and baring her overlapping incisors at the camera at almost every opportunity. In fact, I think her teeth should have gotten second billing.The rest of the story is basically the same as the novel and all following Harlequin romance stories - distant man, girl can't stand him, learns more about him, falls in love (especially when she sees his house), he falls in love with her, oh happy happy joy joy.

641069,A1E7QUM8DG0D16,B00005JOHI,Teresa Medeiros,"[6, 7]","It's so rare to find a satisfying romance at the movies that I nearly dissolved into raptures of delight to discover not one but two of them this weekend! On Friday I had the distinct pleasure of going to see the new theatrical version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE with Keira Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen. To be honest, I was prepared to be disappointed. I had seen the rather murky looking trailer that made even the gorgeous Keira Knightly look washed-out and blotchy. Plus as we all know, every version of P & P must now be compared to that platinum standard of the 1995 BBC mini-series with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.But I found the new movie to be thoroughly delightful and exhilarating! At just a little over 2 hours long, it couldn't cover quite as much ground as the mini-series (Wickham and the two younger sisters had very minor roles), but it beautifully captured the romance and robust good humor of Austen's story. I was caught off guard by several laugh-out-loud moments.Keira Knightly embodied Elizabeth Bennet's intelligence and wit. (Her portrayal also reminded me a little of Jo March in LITTLE WOMEN.) One glimpse of her smile and you knew why Darcy's heart was captivated. MacFadyen as Mr. Darcy won me over in the moment when I realized his voice had the exact same timbre as Alan Rickman's. The murkier cinematography actually ended up making the movie seem more vital and historically accurate. The gritty images of daily life are contrasted with breathtaking shots of the English countryside, including one of Mr. Darcy striding out of the mist that almost rivals Colin Firth's rising up out of Pemberly's pond on the female gasp of appreciation scale. (Yes, this is an actual scientific device. I have one in my office.)(Originally published on the website of author Teresa Medeiros[...])",5,A Surprising Delight,1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,1813,"['so', 'rare', 'find', 'satisfying', 'romance', 'movies', 'nearly', 'dissolved', 'raptures', 'delight', 'discover', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'weekend', 'Friday', 'had', 'distinct', 'pleasure', 'going', 'see', 'new', 'theatrical', 'version', 'PRIDE', 'AND', 'PREJUDICE', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'prepared', 'be', 'disappointed', 'had', 'seen', 'rather', 'murky', 'looking', 'trailer', 'made', 'even', 'gorgeous', 'Keira', 'Knightly', 'look', 'washed-out', 'blotchy', 'know', 'version', 'P', 'P', 'must', 'now', 'be', 'compared', 'platinum', 'standard', '1995', 'BBC', 'mini-series', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle.But', 'found', 'new', 'movie', 'be', 'thoroughly', 'delightful', 'exhilarating', 'just', 'little', '2', 'hours', 'long', 'could', ""n't"", 'cover', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'ground', 'mini-series', 'Wickham', 'two', 'younger', 'sisters', 'had', 'very', 'minor', 'roles', 'beautifully', 'captured', 'romance', 'robust', 'good', 'humor', 'Austen', 'story', 'was', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'several', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments.Keira', 'Knightly', 'embodied', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'intelligence', 'wit', 'portrayal', 'also', 'reminded', 'little', 'Jo', 'March', 'LITTLE', 'WOMEN', 'One', 'glimpse', 'smile', 'knew', 'why', 'Darcy', 'heart', 'was', 'captivated', 'MacFadyen', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'won', 'moment', 'when', 'realized', 'voice', 'had', 'exact', 'same', 'timbre', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'murkier', 'cinematography', 'actually', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'movie', 'seem', 'more', 'vital', 'historically', 'accurate', 'gritty', 'images', 'daily', 'life', 'are', 'contrasted', 'breathtaking', 'shots', 'English', 'countryside', 'including', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'striding', 'mist', 'almost', 'rivals', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'rising', 'up', 'Pemberly', 'pond', 'female', 'gasp', 'appreciation', 'scale', 'Yes', 'actual', 'scientific', 'device', 'have', 'one', 'office', 'Originally', 'published', 'website', 'author', 'Teresa', 'Medeiros', '[', ']']",N/A

641075,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JOHI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[11, 12]","****Aah, Jane Austen. The ""Harry Potter"" of the independent theater chains. Always reliable to pack the theaters. And you can count on a new film based on one of her books every few years.Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) is in a state, her family of five daughters is living on borrowed time. She and her husband Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) live on their current estate as the guests of family members, and it has seen better days. With five growing daughters, she feels it imperative to begin marrying them off, hopefully to rich suitors who can then help provide for Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and the unwed daughters. When word arrives that a nearby estate has been rented by Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), a rich man from London, she becomes anxious that he meet her eldest daughter, Jane (Rosamunde Pike), scheming for them to spend every available moment together. At the local ball, Jane meets Mr. Bingley and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), the second oldest of the Bennet children, meets Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen), Mr. Bingley's friend and guest. Just as Jane and Bingley seem to be headed to the altar, Mr. Bingley leaves the estate causing Jane to become distraught. Elizabeth learns that Darcy may have been responsible and her hatred grows. Yet, every time they meet, Elizabeth finds herself more and more attracted to Darcy. But is the feeling mutual?Just when it seems another film based on a Jane Austen book, especially one already made into a film or miniseries at least six times, not counting the numerous other takes on the same material (""Bride and Prejudice"", a recent example), could be excessive, this version of ""Pride"" pushes the envelope, offering something new.One of the best things this film does is cast more authentic looking people in the lead roles. From Knightley on down, all of the actors have a rougher appearance, which seems entirely appropriate for the time. Some previous film adaptations of Austen's work have cast the most beautiful American (Aaaah- Gwyneth Paltrow - choo!) or British actors in the roles. Every time they appeared on screen, it looked like they just walked out of their make-up trailer. Sure, they looked beautiful, but it isn't believable. ""Pride"" strives for and attains a more accurate depiction.Keira Knightley is very pretty, but she isn't glamorous. Too skinny, which may be the one aspect of her that doesn't fit the period, she otherwise seems like a pretty girl. Her features are not perfect and this helps her seem to be a natural fit for the English countryside. Also, there are many scenes in which she has just come in from a walk, or the girls are laying about reading books, etc., and they don't appear perfectly groomed; hair may be out of place or there may be mud on the hem of their skirt. It works. In one scene, Dame Judi Dench arrives at the Bennet home. Irate, her hair is not perfect, because she has just arrived on horseback. Matthew McFadyen is also very handsome, but he isn't movie star handsome. He isn't as good looking as Colin Firth or Hugh Grant and it seems more appropriate for the role, the setting and the time.Director Joe Wright also does some interesting things with the camera, which may seem strange or obtrusive on paper, but actually make the experience of watching the film more interesting and enjoyable. In one scene, the camera follows Mrs. Bennet through a ball hosted by Mr. Bingley. She passes certain people throughout the filled rooms. When the camera spots one of the Bennet girls, it stops briefly, allowing us to hear their conversation. After we have heard what we need, it picks up and follows another character, past another conversation. Soon, the camera spots Mrs. Bennet again as she finally reaches the outdoor patio for some fresh air. In another, the camera roves across the windows in the Bennet home picking up pieces of conversation in each of the bedrooms, starting with Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. This gives us the feeling we are watching a book come to life, as though we are turning the pages as we read. It is an effective technique, aiding the look and feel of the film.All of the performances in the film are very good. Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen are very believable as the unrequited lovers. Knightley conveys Elizabeth's intelligence, pride and passion, at turns, throughout the film. She is low key, but very interesting. When she initially meets Darcy, she claims her hatred for him and his attitude. Later, as she tells her father she really loves him, he doesn't understand, yet we do. Matthew MacFadyen conveys Darcy's boredom, growing attraction and passion as well. There are more than a few instances when their attraction to one another is palpable, yet because of their misunderstandings, or misconceptions about one another, are unable to act. It seems as though they take shifts; in one scene Elizabeth is in love with him. In others, he loves her. Throughout, reciprocation is prevented by an outside influence of some sort. The final scene is also very romantic.All of the supporting characters are equally believable. Brenda Blethyn is a little over the top, but it works to see her running around, insinuating her daughters into the lives of every eligible bachelor within ten miles. Donald Sutherland is great as the father who is much quieter than his wife, yet he exudes a quiet admiration for his partner. He is also the more level headed member of the family providing calm and serenity to his somewhat overbearing wife.

The scenery was luscious, the acting was convincing, and the period of the drama seemed more authentic than this version. Also the cinamentographer had breathtaking views. Also, this 1995 version is light, breezy, and easy comedic drama. I believe this is the movie catapulted Colin Firth's career.  For me, he will always be ""the"" Mr. Darcy.Now, regarding this 2005 remake, for the film has been remade many times, it was a very drab. I love Keira Knightly, and I thought Brenda Bleven played her part well; however, Allison Steadman, who played the mother in the 1995 version, was very irritating but funny too. I didn't like Donald Sutherland portrayal as the father. To me, he seemed somewhat aloof as the father. Of all the sisters, Jena Malone, who portrayed Lydia, was the most miscast as was the actor who played Mr. Collins. If you get the 1995 version, watch how David Bammer who played this role just makes you laugh at his portrayal of this character. In my opinion, the main fault of this movie, along with the casting, should not have been squeezed into two hours. The 1995 version, on two discs, was just over 5 hours.Andrew Davies, the British screenwriter, really caught the nuance of Jane Austin's book. I'm sure this is the movie that help catapult Colin Firth's film career. In my opinion, he's never had a better role even although he's gone on to have been nominated as Best Actor for ""A Single Man"", then later won the Oscar for his role in ""The King's Speech.""

641079,ALG7QH2L5JL2L,B00005JOHI,"T. Noever ""Author of the TETHYS series""","[5, 8]","First of all, I enjoyed this version; I really did. What it got right is a more distinct sense of the darker and chaotic side of Jane Austen's worlds. There's a lot of melancholy here, which wasn't rendered in the preceding TV series. The Brits--though this time contaminated by French input, which didn't help at all; it seldom does-can do Austen very well indeed when they put their midns to it. The BBC version of Emma with Kate Beckinsale was so much superior to the boring Paltrow cinema version.Where does this latest production of P&P; fail?The first problem coming to mind is the script. Adaptation is an art all of its own, and while the TV series had time to plot out most of the significant narrative strands of the novel, two hours of film doesn't. Purely from a scripting point of view, significant characterizations--'significant' in the sense that they contributed to the explication and bringing-to-live of the central characters--were far too 'pro forma', almost as if they were thrown in because the writer felt that they needed to. The result was that many of them had no function at all, and cluttered up the action and diffused the narrative focus.The second problem had to do with direction. The first half, with the aid of the muddled script, was confusing, unconvincing and occasionally annoying. I loved the deconstruction of the decorous superficiality that adhered to the TV series, and the occasionally chaotic social occasions; but in the end it got too much, and the interactions of the main characters were lost, instead of, as the director presumably intended, contextualized. Also, the sound was awful. The deliberate toning-down and made-hard-to-hear-above-the-din of individual conversations may have had an element of realism, but the strain of the listener, having to work out just exactly what was being said, didn't help one's becoming engrossed in the tale. The vacuous sisters and mother and their hysterical carry-ons also became annoying and were overdone and for too long.Third problem: Keira Knightley. She's a cool actress, who fits perfectly into King Arthur, Pirates of the Caribbean, Love Actually--but here she was very much miscast. If the producers had had any guts they would have cast the incomparable Rosamund Pike in that role, instead of wasting her in the nearly-invisible part of Jane Bennett. Rosamund was the saving grace among the women of Die Another Day, and here, too, she basically stole the show without even trying hard whenever she appeared, whether she said or did much or, as was the case for the most time, not. Keira, by contrast, needs to act-by-effort since she doesn't as yet have enough depth of personality. Too much 'star' and not enough 'character'; quite unsuitable for this part. She battled her way through it valiantly, and I admire her for that, but it just wasn't 'right' for her. The mis-casting was rivaled only by the casting of Katie Holmes in Batman Begins.Fourth problem: just about all the male characters, except for Donald Sutherland, who can do no wrong. That the film should fade out with a shot of him was an unexpected stroke of genius. I wonder if it was scripted that way or a directorial decision. (I never saw the alternate ending, which I probably would have loathed; so let's go with this one and pretend that the other never was).Having said all these basically negative things, I'd like to finish on a positive note, which is that in the second half, when the 'busy-ness' started to abate, the film actually acquired depth and became quite touching. The final scene between Elizabeth and her father was the crown, and if an ending is what makes a movie, it makes me forgive many other mistakes.But just imagine if, instead of Keira Knightley it had Rosamunde Pike who had been doing that scene with Sutherland. It would have been near-perfection.It was meant to be FOUR stars (I entered five by mistake!) and that solely because of the second half and a great attempt to take the saccharine edge off the movie-incarnations of Austen's novels.Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELADIENNA",5,Enjoyable but flawed,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,4118,"['First', 'enjoyed', 'version', 'really', 'did', 'What', 'got', 'right', 'more', 'distinct', 'sense', 'darker', 'chaotic', 'side', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'worlds', 'lot', 'melancholy', 'here', 'was', ""n't"", 'rendered', 'preceding', 'TV', 'series', 'Brits', 'time', 'contaminated', 'French', 'input', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'seldom', 'does-can', 'do', 'Austen', 'very', 'well', 'indeed', 'when', 'put', 'midns', 'BBC', 'version', 'Emma', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'superior', 'boring', 'Paltrow', 'cinema', 'version.Where', 'latest', 'production', 'P', 'P', 'fail', 'first', 'problem', 'coming', 'mind', 'script', 'Adaptation', 'art', 'own', 'TV', 'series', 'had', 'time', 'plot', 'out', 'most', 'significant', 'narrative', 'strands', 'novel', 'two', 'hours', 'film', ""n't"", 'Purely', 'scripting', 'point', 'view', 'significant', 'characterizations', ""'significant"", 'sense', 'contributed', 'explication', 'bringing-to-live', 'central', 'characters', 'were', 'far', 'too', ""'pro"", 'forma', 'almost', 'were', 'thrown', 'writer', 'felt', 'needed', 'result', 'was', 'many', 'had', 'function', 'cluttered', 'up', 'action', 'diffused', 'narrative', 'focus.The', 'second', 'problem', 'had', 'do', 'direction', 'first', 'half', 'aid', 'muddled', 'script', 'was', 'confusing', 'unconvincing', 'occasionally', 'annoying', 'loved', 'deconstruction', 'decorous', 'superficiality', 'adhered', 'TV', 'series', 'occasionally', 'chaotic', 'social', 'occasions', 'end', 'got', 'too', 'much', 'interactions', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'lost', 'instead', 'director', 'presumably', 'intended', 'contextualized', 'Also', 'sound', 'was', 'awful', 'deliberate', 'toning-down', 'made-hard-to-hear-above-the-din', 'individual', 'conversations', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'element', 'realism', 'strain', 'listener', 'having', 'work', 'out', 'just', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'one', 'becoming', 'engrossed', 'tale', 'vacuous', 'sisters', 'mother', 'hysterical', 'carry-ons', 'also', 'became', 'annoying', 'were', 'overdone', 'too', 'long.Third', 'problem', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'cool', 'actress', 'who', 'perfectly', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Pirates', 'Caribbean', 'Love', 'Actually', 'here', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'miscast', 'producers', 'had', 'had', 'guts', 'would', 'have', 'cast', 'incomparable', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'role', 'instead', 'wasting', 'nearly-invisible', 'part', 'Jane', 'Bennett', 'Rosamund', 'was', 'saving', 'grace', 'women', 'Die', 'Day', 'here', 'too', 'basically', 'stole', 'show', 'even', 'trying', 'hard', 'whenever', 'appeared', 'said', 'did', 'much', 'was', 'case', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'Keira', 'contrast', 'act-by-effort', ""n't"", 'as', 'yet', 'have', 'enough', 'depth', 'personality', 'Too', 'much', ""'star"", 'not', 'enough', ""'character"", 'unsuitable', 'part', 'battled', 'way', 'valiantly', 'admire', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", ""'right"", 'mis-casting', 'was', 'rivaled', 'only', 'casting', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Batman', 'Begins.Fourth', 'problem', 'just', 'male', 'characters', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'wrong', 'film', 'should', 'fade', 'out', 'shot', 'was', 'unexpected', 'stroke', 'genius', 'wonder', 'was', 'scripted', 'way', 'directorial', 'decision', 'never', 'saw', 'alternate', 'ending', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'loathed', 'let', 'go', 'one', 'pretend', 'other', 'never', 'was', '.Having', 'said', 'basically', 'negative', 'things', ""'d"", 'like', 'finish', 'positive', 'note', 'second', 'half', 'when', ""'busy-ness"", 'started', 'abate', 'film', 'actually', 'acquired', 'depth', 'became', 'quite', 'touching', 'final', 'scene', 'Elizabeth', 'father', 'was', 'crown', 'ending', 'what', 'movie', 'forgive', 'many', 'other', 'mistakes.But', 'just', 'imagine', 'instead', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'had', 'Rosamunde', 'Pike', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'scene', 'Sutherland', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'near-perfection.It', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'FOUR', 'stars', 'entered', 'five', 'mistake', 'solely', 'second', 'half', 'great', 'attempt', 'take', 'saccharine', 'edge', 'movie-incarnations', 'Austen', 'novels.Till', 'Noever', 'owlglass.com', 'Author', 'KEAEN', 'CONTINUITY', 'SLIP', 'SELADIENNA']",N/A

641081,A2817E4ZO8LJ0M,B00005JOHI,Tom Chatt,"[5, 6]","We greatly enjoyed seeing the new adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen's stories are rich romances, featuring strong and spirited women who seem like they won't get the man they deserve, and the men are often not what they seem at first blush (both good and bad), but character always triumphs over class and money in her endings. In this story, protagonists Lizzie Bennett and Mr. Darcy spar engagingly like Beatrice and Benedick until the inevitable reconciliation. Keira Knightly is perfectly cast as the spirited Lizzie, and Matthew MacFadyen is marvelous as the brooding and taciturn Darcy. The story has been very nicely adapted to the screen by big screen newbies director Joe Wright and writer Deborah Moggach (though rumor has it that Emma Thompson had some hand in the dialogue; she is credited on the film with ""special thanks""), in a sensitive handling that focuses on the romance and the character judgments (and mistakes) that people can make. Beautiful shots of English countryside, together with some very subjective camerawork contribute to the story. (One memorable scene: when Lizzie and Mr. Darcy are dancing at a crowded ball, and for a moment we see the scene as Lizzie does, as if they are the only two in the room, providing a nice depth of feeling in contrast to her seemingly aloof repartee.) The cast are all excellent, but especially notable are Donald Sutherland as the loving father Mr. Bennett (who truly wants his daughter to marry for love), Tom Hollander as the mousy and obsequious Mr. Collins, and of course Judi Dench as the imperious Lady Catherine de Bourg. The costumes, settings, and even the blocking (all that courtly bowing) perfectly recreate the texture of the period.

641082,A2A0ZT12G34QB1,B00005JOHI,Toomuchtimeonmyhands,"[698, 787]","Okay, I am a rabid Frith and BBC fan of the miniseries, but I was very impressed with this adaption and found it refershing in it's grounded, youthful take on the story.For starters, there is a very grounded nature to the presentation of the story. Some Austenites got their knickers into a twist because they thought it made the family and their circumstances too drab looking. But I loved it! The Meryton Assembly basically sets the stage for this grounded approach-the dancing looks a little heavy footed, the girls look sweaty, and you can't help but think that someone needs to open a window cause it looks awfully sweaty! But at the same time,it made the story come alive, like you were a fly on the wall, peeking in on Lizzy and Darcy and the rest of the gang.Lastly, I loved the youthful take on the story. I LOVE Firth and Ehle as the '95 leads. They had this chemistry and sensual tension that was electric! But their take was definitely from a mature standpoint-like the way I'd act now as a 33 year old woman. Whereas Macfadyen and Knightley?

When I first heard that they were making a new version of Pride and Prejudice, I was excited.  Then when I heard that Keira Knightley was playing Elizabeth, I was put out.  Understand, please, that while Knightley is just fine as a pirate-movie chick, I do not believe she has the acting props or even appreciation of the character she is playing (don't take it to heart, Elizabeth Bennett is, you know, the most complex and thoroughly likeable, believable female character in literature.).  She was ok, a little better than I thought she would be, but I did not recognise Lizzy Bennett in her.  Matthew MacFayden I liked more the second time through, but really thought basically the same of him as of Keira Knightley, that he was more a pretty face to put on the screen than a serious competitor for the ""perfect"" Mr. Darcy.Perhaps my favorite part of the movie was Jane Bennett, who is played very well by an actress whose name I don't know, but who loks and acts the part sublimely.  Sometimes it's hard to like Jane in the book, because she's just too perfect, but she makes you realize why it is that everyone likes Jane, and it was a joy to watch her performance.As for the soundtrack, it was very pretty, but I kept on thinking to myself, ""if you're going to sound exactly like Chopin, why not just use Chopin?  He's dead, he's not going to care.""Anyway, it was a very enjoyable movie, I went to see it twice and liked it both times, but when you're dealing with a classic like P and P, I think a little more care would be in order.

It depends solely on this - Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy. Without the chemistry between these endearingly headstrong characters, there is no point in making a new film, no matter how much money you spend on the sets and the costumes.The newest version of Jane Austen classic (`Pride & Prejudice') will be met with skepticism, but as far as Keira Knightley's portrait of this feisty heroine goes, it is a perfect success. Forget her terribly miscast role in `Domino,' and enjoy the film's spirited heroine who learns a thing or two about romance in the late 18th century England.Compared with her, Matthew Macfadyen who plays the laconic Mr. Darcy is less advantageous from the first. We have seen impeccable portrait from Colin Firth (and another impeccable one from Laurence Olivier), and who can forget them? Surprisingly, Macfadyen's Darcy turns out a convincing one, the aristocratic image of a person with something repressed deep inside. Unfortunately, he is not allowed to do much in this running time.[MODERN TOUCH ALL AROUND] I personally do not find the modernized dialogues exchanged between the characters so irritating as some viewers say. I know the film focuses the original book's romantic side, and gives less attention to the class structure of the Regency Britain. But if you have to make a 2-hour film, something must go. If romance must go, then ... what is the point of making this film anyway?But I thought first-time director Joe Wright did some missteps during those two hours. He uses too much showy camera works (there is a long one-take sequence in which the camera glides on the dancing floor) while more orthodox way of shooting the scenes are more effective. As to the portraits of the Bennet Family, some might find the eldest sister Jane (Rosamund Pike) is less impressive than she should be, and I for one thought Donald Sutherland, amusing as he is, might be too old for the role of Mr. Bennet.I know `Pride & Prejudice' should not be compared unfavorably with the previous versions though I was, and am, tempted to do so.

Now I realize how lucky I was to get the full screen version. Recently, I borrowed a copy of the widescreen version from my local library just to see how much I was missing. For some reason, though, I didn't enjoy the widescreen version like I did the full screen version. I then used two computers to run both versions at once, cued at the same time, on side by side monitors and then it became glaringly obvious that the widescreen bars were cutting off immense amounts of important parts of the picture. Yes, the widescreen gives the wider shot, but most of composition of the focus of the scenes is not widescreen in nature, so you're not gaining a lot of important imagery from the widescreen format, but you are losing A LOT from the top and bottom that you get with the full screen format. This really surprised me. I've always assumed that widescreen versions were the full picture shown at the theaters. If the widescreen DVD version is the version shown on the big screen at the theater, then the theater audience missed a tremendous amount of the pleasure of watching this film. I have a hard time believing that this could be the case. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE VISUAL PLEASURE WITH THE FULLSCREEN VERSION. For instance, in the scene at Netherfield where Lydia asks Bingley to host a ball, in the shot of Bingley, Darcy, and Caroline, in the widescreen version, Caroline is cut off at the stomach by the lower bar, while on the fullscreen version of the same shot, you see her near fully sitting on the couch in a way that is very expressive for the scene. Frankly, I pity those who have only seen this movie on the widescreen DVD. What a great shame! How can this be?

I just finished re-reading Pride & Prejudice about a week ago and wanted to watch the film, so I rented this and absolutely adored it. It is always tough to make a great book into a movie, but they did a great job with this one: they stayed relatively close to the original, simplifying a few plot lines to keep the story concise and focused. People who have read the book will know there is a lot more to Wickham's story, but you can definitely see why they would limit his time.I think the movie did a fantastic job of portraying the Charlotte/Collins relationship, which in turn highlights the really miserable life options women had in this time frame. As Charlotte says, &#34;I am 27 years old. I am already a burden on my family...&#34;Costume, hair and makeup were all excellent in this film. Casting was wonderful. Cinematography, fantastic.There was so much to like about this movie that renting it just wasn't enough. I want to have a copy for my collection so I can watch it again and again.I have a total book-characer crush on Mr. Darcy, and Keira Knightley did a wonderful job of showing just why Mr. Darcy would fall in love with her. Not only is she beautiful in a very natural way, she is sassy and she doesn't take any garbage from anyone, which was an extremely unusual trait in any woman of her time.Mrs. Bennett was just as fabulously inappropriate as she was in the book.My one disappointment with the movie is that they don't include any of the information that Jane Austen shared at the end of the book about how everyone's lives turned out later on--ie, what is life like for Lydia, Mary, Kitty and everyone else in the family five years down the road. I also thought they could have spent a bit more time highlighting the extremely awkward experience that Lydia's homecoming should have been. It is difficult, with our modern perspective, to really appreciate how just how completely inappropriate Lydia's behavior was.Still, one of the best great-book-to-movie adaptations I've seen.",5,"I rented it, now I'm going to buy the DVD",1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,2081,"['was', 'great', 'movie', 'relatively', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'book', 'just', 'finished', 're-reading', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'week', 'ago', 'wanted', 'watch', 'film', 'rented', 'absolutely', 'adored', 'always', 'tough', 'make', 'great', 'book', 'movie', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'one', 'stayed', 'relatively', 'close', 'original', 'simplifying', 'few', 'plot', 'lines', 'keep', 'story', 'concise', 'focused', 'People', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'know', 'lot', 'more', 'Wickham', 'story', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'limit', 'time.I', 'think', 'movie', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'Charlotte/Collins', 'relationship', 'turn', 'highlights', 'really', 'miserable', 'life', 'options', 'women', 'had', 'time', 'frame', 'Charlotte', '34', 'am', '27', 'years', 'old', 'am', 'already', 'burden', 'family', '34', 'Costume', 'hair', 'makeup', 'were', 'excellent', 'film', 'Casting', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Cinematography', 'fantastic.There', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'like', 'movie', 'renting', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'want', 'have', 'copy', 'collection', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again.I', 'have', 'total', 'book-characer', 'crush', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'showing', 'just', 'why', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'Not', 'only', 'beautiful', 'very', 'natural', 'way', 'sassy', ""n't"", 'take', 'garbage', 'anyone', 'was', 'extremely', 'unusual', 'trait', 'woman', 'time.Mrs', 'Bennett', 'was', 'just', 'fabulously', 'inappropriate', 'was', 'book.My', 'one', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'include', 'information', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'shared', 'end', 'book', 'how', 'everyone', 'lives', 'turned', 'out', 'later', 'ie', 'what', 'life', 'Lydia', 'Mary', 'Kitty', 'everyone', 'else', 'family', 'five', 'years', 'road', 'also', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'highlighting', 'extremely', 'awkward', 'experience', 'Lydia', 'homecoming', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'modern', 'perspective', 'really', 'appreciate', 'how', 'just', 'how', 'completely', 'inappropriate', 'Lydia', 'behavior', 'was.Still', 'one', 'best', 'great-book-to-movie', 'adaptations', ""'ve"", 'seen']",N/A

I decided on the above shorter version first and it was the right decision after having now watched watched both versions. Unlike any devout P&P; fan and not having seen either versions before, I at least can watch it for what it is without any pre-conceived notions. It wasnt long into watching this version which I will call the Knightley version, that I noticed a problem with the sound. I couldnt work out if it was me, the player or the transfer. Five to ten minutes in and I said to myself I cant the heck make out what theyre talking about. Dialogue was drowned out by over-powering background music and ran so fast. I had no choice but to start it again and put the subtitles on which as pointed out by another reviewer were often 3 liners and placed which was a nuisance. For that alone I had to drop 1 star when I would have awarded it 5 stars.Sure there was 'Poetic License' taken in this Knightley version. Like theyre manor was more like a farmhouse and very rough and hardly an upper middle to high class. Donald Sutherland though a great actor imho didnt suit his part, he hardly resembled the English Gentleman of his time, more like Colonial America civil war period. These things aside I found this version to be more dynamic then the Firth version. This version gave more goose bumps, lumps in throat and emotional tears. Knightley was perfect in her role she was more dynamic and head strong then in previous version. What you didnt see in this 2 hr.version I saw in the Firth version to fill in the gaps. Which is why I decided on the right version to start off my viewing. So all in all, dont miss this version, it was beautiful even with some of its flaws. It is as I say far more dynamic then the previous Firth version. I also preferred Darcy in this version.UPDATE:Well after seeing the 5 hr. Firth version I could not resist in watching this Knightley version yet once again. It was as moving as the first time I watched it. Only this time I added to my title review the words 'Magical and Etherial' for it truly is as such. Furthermore re the sound short comings. I viewed it this time without the annoying subtitles and came to the conclusion that whilst the production starts almost with a ball which drowned the dialogue I thereafter was able to go along with the dialogue as I say without the subtitles and was better off for it. One still may miss some dialogue as it is still an imperfect sound, but better to take in all the splendour then concentrate on reading every word of the subtitle. My main gripe is that this production should have been longer with at least 3 hours. Especially missing is a wedding scene in its finale and makes ruse with dialogue depicting post marriage. Nevertheless truly magical and NOT to be missed.If you found this review helpful at all please vote on it. Thanks.

641100,A2AGBL998D0FYY,B00005JOHI,VReviews,"[4, 5]","Jane Austen affected a sea change in the novel in the early 1800s. Before that time the novel was limited to rather farfetched adventure stories like Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. In the early 19th century, writing about everyday events was quite out of the ordinary, and Jane was the first to successfully portray the behind the scenes workings of the ladies and gentlemen of the English countryside.Watching a new adaptation of a Jane Austen novel is like seeing Shakespeare's Hamlet, there are no surprises in the final outcome. Rather the entertainment comes in the particular adaptation, actor's skills, and production qualities. Austen's Pride & Prejudice is one of her most popular novels, and each time it has found it's way onto the big screen and into DVD it's created a lot of passion for and against the adaptation.Universal's production has had a number of disappointed viewers as evidenced by many an online review. This disappointment typically seems to stem with having something to do with the casting decisions and the perceived lack of chemistry between the principal players. Conversely, some felt there was too much chemistry, or not enough propriety in the manner in which the Bennet's conducted themselves. Or that the Bennet's were incorrectly shown to be struggling financially and therefore didn't live or dress up to the idealized version of English gentility.To the chemistry of the actors, I believe the casting in Universal's version was excellent. Matthew Macfadyen perfectly portrayed the aloof, shy, yet emotionally caring Mr. Darcy. Keira Knightley is a surprise in this role, for she is able to capture the strong-willed, hastily opinionated and yet free spirited Elizabeth Bennet quite well. But more importantly, this adaptation develops the full picture of the Bennet Family, with all five Bennet girls, with their individual personalities vying for the best dress, or introduction. Both Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet, and Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet are superb in their timing, and comedic needling of one another. Judi Dench as the controlling Lady Catherine de Bourg, is pleasingly condescending wicked.Screenwriter Deborah Moggach portrayed the Bennet family in a very real and grounded environment. While she may have packaged Austen's novel in a less glamorous light than is typical; she was able to reflect the troubling circumstances people of that time had to deal with.  After all, the financial fix and worry of having five girls with no inheritance in 18th century England was the very point of view and experience that Jane wrote from.Between Director Wright and screenwriter Moggach, this version of Pride & Prejudice is deeply thought-provoking, and portrays the ups and down, moral questions, dilemmas, and hardships of being in society in the 18th century.",5,Full Picture of the Bennet Family,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,2817,"['Jane', 'Austen', 'affected', 'sea', 'change', 'novel', 'early', '1800s', 'time', 'novel', 'was', 'limited', 'rather', 'farfetched', 'adventure', 'stories', 'Daniel', 'Defoe', 'Robinson', 'Crusoe', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'writing', 'everyday', 'events', 'was', 'quite', 'ordinary', 'Jane', 'was', 'first', 'successfully', 'portray', 'scenes', 'workings', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'English', 'countryside.Watching', 'new', 'adaptation', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'novel', 'seeing', 'Shakespeare', 'Hamlet', 'are', 'surprises', 'final', 'outcome', 'entertainment', 'particular', 'adaptation', 'actor', 'skills', 'production', 'qualities', 'Austen', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'novels', 'time', 'found', 'way', 'big', 'screen', 'DVD', 'created', 'lot', 'passion', 'adaptation.Universal', 'production', 'had', 'number', 'disappointed', 'viewers', 'evidenced', 'many', 'online', 'review', 'disappointment', 'typically', 'stem', 'having', 'something', 'do', 'casting', 'decisions', 'perceived', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'principal', 'players', 'Conversely', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'chemistry', 'not', 'enough', 'propriety', 'manner', 'Bennet', 'conducted', 'Bennet', 'were', 'incorrectly', 'shown', 'be', 'struggling', 'financially', 'therefore', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'dress', 'up', 'idealized', 'version', 'English', 'gentility.To', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'believe', 'casting', 'Universal', 'version', 'was', 'excellent', 'Matthew', 'Macfadyen', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'aloof', 'shy', 'yet', 'emotionally', 'caring', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'surprise', 'role', 'able', 'capture', 'strong-willed', 'hastily', 'opinionated', 'yet', 'free', 'spirited', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'quite', 'well', 'more', 'importantly', 'adaptation', 'full', 'picture', 'Bennet', 'Family', 'five', 'Bennet', 'girls', 'individual', 'personalities', 'vying', 'best', 'dress', 'introduction', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'are', 'superb', 'timing', 'comedic', 'needling', 'one', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'controlling', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourg', 'pleasingly', 'condescending', 'wicked.Screenwriter', 'Deborah', 'Moggach', 'portrayed', 'Bennet', 'family', 'very', 'real', 'grounded', 'environment', 'may', 'have', 'packaged', 'Austen', 'novel', 'less', 'glamorous', 'light', 'typical', 'was', 'able', 'reflect', 'troubling', 'circumstances', 'people', 'time', 'had', 'deal', 'financial', 'fix', 'worry', 'having', 'five', 'girls', 'inheritance', '18th', 'century', 'England', 'was', 'very', 'point', 'view', 'experience', 'Jane', 'wrote', 'from.Between', 'Director', 'Wright', 'screenwriter', 'Moggach', 'version', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'deeply', 'thought-provoking', 'ups', 'down', 'moral', 'questions', 'dilemmas', 'hardships', 'being', 'society', '18th', 'century']",N/A

641104,A1C80B497LCYKA,B00005JOHI,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[7, 11]","While PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is admittedly gorgeous on almost every visual level, a weak script and strange interpretations by both director and actors mar this otherwise enjoyable film. Joe Wright directs this adaptation of the Jane Austin classic that pairs a country girl lacking looks but loaded with prejudice - played by Keira Knightley - with a city gentleman short on personality but full of pride - played by Matthew Macfadyen. While Wright is true to the period as far as look, he is utterly clueless as far as the manners and customs of the people.So many things that happened left me scratching my head. For example, would the Bennet family really have left their laundry hanging on the line at the beginning of a rainstorm while they stood at the window watching? This may say something about the impracticality of the Bennets; but the way it was handled, it says more about the naivete of the director. Also, people walking in and out of other people's houses and bedrooms unannounced; the grandest lady of the county, Lady Catherine, dropping by unescorted in the middle of the night - and sunburned, no less; a gentleman showing up at dawn to propose, and on foot; everyone getting up from a meal so two people could talk instead of sending them into the parlor: people were more formal and considerate than that in the late 1700's and early 1800's. These types of faux pas break down the credibility of the film and make it less than it could have been.My biggest problem was with the two stars. While Keira Knightly was winsome enough as Elizabeth Bennet, her mischievous smile reminded me of a cat or rat. And since she smiles a lot in the film, I had a hard time warming up to her. Most disappointing, though, was Matthew Macfadyen's downright wooden portrayal of Mr. Darcy. I do believe there is a way to play a character lacking personality without becoming a moribund oaf. Neither actor is particularly attractive in this production, and their odd expressions and mannerisms make them even less so. And their lack of chemistry - even though their relationship is supposed to be alienating and strained - is almost painful. Again, there is a way for two people to act like they dislike each other and still show the telltale signs of a growing attraction. When their love for each other is finally revealed, it seems very unlikely. It certainly isn't emotionally explosive the way the revelation of love between Edward and Elinor in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was. The supporting cast members give far more interesting performances than the stars, and, in most cases, outshine them.The most redeeming aspect of this film is visual, especially the cinematography, which is stunning. There is one tracking shot at the party which is very clever, and makes us feel we are part of it. It begins with Mr. Bennet closing the keyboard to the piano on Mary who had been indiscreetly singing away, continues through the various rooms and conversations, and ends with Mr. Bennet and Mary making up, with a final tag of Elizabeth outside by herself. The entire shot lasts 3 minutes - it seems longer - and is masterful. Another noteworthy shot - less clever because of its self-consciousness - is one of Elizabeth on a swing in the barn, and we are spinning with her, watching the different scenes outside the barn change as they go flying past. While the technique is interesting, it is disruptive, because we are no longer lost in the story, but have suddenly become aware of the camera and what it is doing - an unforgivable sin in cinematography.

(I'd give it no stars if the system allowed.)  Virtually every production detail -- the costumes, the hair styles, the number of people at the balls, failure to show Darcy's attraction to Lizzy from the first, behavior of individual characters (Bingley's entering Jane's room in the night, Lady Catherine's pounding on the door for a night time visit), the ludicrous sculpture gallery at Pemberley etc. etc. -- is wrong.  The abilities of such actors as Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland are wasted by a script that essentially gives them nothing worthwhile to do.  They are reduced to being little more than set decoration.  A single feature film cannot include everything in the novel, of course (the much praised 1995 BBC production left things out, too), but a better script would more truly reflect the original, and none of the production details listed can be explained as necessary because of the limitations of adaptation.

I'd already heard that it had played havoc with Austen's language, pacing and intent.  I'd heard about the pigs, the period inappropriate behavior of the characters, the idiosyncratic scenes such as the midnight arrival of the great Dragon Lady, the bursting into ladies rooms, the list is endless.  I was prepared for all these absurdities, but had also heard that it was cinematically lovely, took chances and the characters were age appropriate. Yet still I was appalled by the reality.In all fairness we've been spoilt by the last 1995 tremendous miniseries adaptation by the BBC. And a 2 hour movie by its very nature cannot do justice to Austen's matchless prose and wit. But it was horrifying to watch an Austen film stripped of subtlety, wit, pace, delicate but biting social observation (there was nothing hinted at here, it's thrown in your face like slop at a pig!) and almost completely denuded of that sublime Austen language.It's difficult to say at whose feet lies the blame for the terrible acting choices, the horrible editing, the nonsensical exposition. Even the music, which at times I enjoyed as it was very reminiscent of Chopin/Beethoven/Mozart is almost too wall to wall and syrupy and turns Austen into mush.I am making a mad dash for my 1995 BBC version to cleanse my palate and am only thankful that I only rented this version.",2,a ghastly disappointment,1158192000,"09 14, 2006",2006,1460,"['was', 'very', 'prepared', 'like', 'film', 'wanted', ""'d"", 'been', 'warned', 'liberties', 'took', ""'d"", 'already', 'heard', 'had', 'played', 'havoc', 'Austen', 'language', 'pacing', 'intent', ""'d"", 'heard', 'pigs', 'period', 'inappropriate', 'behavior', 'characters', 'idiosyncratic', 'scenes', 'such', 'midnight', 'arrival', 'great', 'Dragon', 'Lady', 'bursting', 'ladies', 'rooms', 'list', 'endless', 'was', 'prepared', 'absurdities', 'had', 'also', 'heard', 'was', 'cinematically', 'lovely', 'took', 'chances', 'characters', 'were', 'age', 'appropriate', 'still', 'was', 'appalled', 'reality.In', 'fairness', ""'ve"", 'been', 'spoilt', 'last', '1995', 'tremendous', 'miniseries', 'adaptation', 'BBC', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'very', 'nature', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'Austen', 'matchless', 'prose', 'wit', 'was', 'horrifying', 'watch', 'Austen', 'film', 'stripped', 'subtlety', 'wit', 'pace', 'delicate', 'biting', 'social', 'observation', 'was', 'nothing', 'hinted', 'here', 'thrown', 'face', 'slop', 'pig', 'almost', 'completely', 'denuded', 'sublime', 'Austen', 'language.It', 'difficult', 'say', 'feet', 'blame', 'terrible', 'acting', 'choices', 'horrible', 'editing', 'nonsensical', 'exposition', 'Even', 'music', 'times', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Chopin/Beethoven/Mozart', 'almost', 'too', 'wall', 'wall', 'syrupy', 'turns', 'Austen', 'mush.I', 'am', 'making', 'mad', 'dash', '1995', 'BBC', 'version', 'cleanse', 'palate', 'am', 'only', 'thankful', 'only', 'rented', 'version']",N/A
641107,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B00005JOHI,Wanda B. Red,"[13, 19]","I watched both the 2005 film and the 1995 A&E; version close together in time; both are wonderful - the film manages to achieve almost the same effect in just under half the time. Both are respectful of Austen's novel.The new film version is very very fine. The biggest difference between the two is the space allowed to develop various aspects of character and plot (i.e., in the `95 TV series we see the developments from Lizzie's AND Darcy's points of view, we see them in flashback, sometimes multiple times). But the new film version does an excellent job of conveying the book, even if some scenes must necessarily be omitted. The flashbacks of the A&E; version are an easy way of telegraphing a character's second thoughts, but a really good actor can convey doubt and complexity without this assistance.The hardest character for an actor to portray in Austen's novel is Mr. Darcy. Is he a prideful and arrogant aristocrat who changes -- that is, is he a bad character who grows, develops, and becomes good? Or is he a good character who, from the outset, is at least partly misunderstood? There is evidence to support both interpretations. As we learn, all his family, including his servants, who have known him for his whole life admire his integrity and his kindness. But he certainly gives Elizabeth Bennet reason from the outset to find him cold, distant, and even snobbish. However terrific Colin Firth is in the A&E; version, his representation of the character comes down pretty strongly for change and growth, while Matthew MacFadyen, the hero of the recent film and the sweetest Mr. Darcy you would ever want to meet, keeps the question open. His reserve at the beginning could easily be chalked up to shyness. Both Darcies have much to recommend them. Even though Firth leaves more of the impression of confidence and sharpness that I got from Austen's novel, I think I actually prefer the sweetness of MacFadyen, who does a better job of convincing us that he actually finds Elizabeth attractive from the beginning.I'm not a fan of the actress who plays Elizabeth in the 2005 film -- Keira Knightley (her name rhymes with sprightly, only too conveniently) -- but she does credit, in her odd and energetic way, to Lizzie Bennet, and Donald Sutherland makes a surprisingly good Mr. Bennet (though perhaps not quite so true to the book as Benjamin Whitrow in the A&E; version). As much as I admire Brenda Blethyn in other films she is not great here; she is nothing to the earlier BBC Bennet mother Alison Steadman, who more perfectly captures the mother's hysterics. And I don't think Judi Dench is well cast as Lady Catherine de Bourgh (in the movie); she is just too regal and admirable in her own right; Lady Catherine needs a certain reptilian quality, which Barbara Leigh-Hunt in the A&E; production manages very capably. Also, I must admit that Tom Hollander's Mr. Collins in the 2005 does not hold a candle to the simpering skin-crawling performance of David Bamber in the BBC version of that part. Despite these quibbles, however, the makers of this film had their wits about them. Most importantly, they were not afraid of emotion. Both versions end with a very satisfying and un-Austenlike kiss.The music in this film is lush and engaging; the landscape, notwithwithstanding the opinion of other reviewers, captures the constrained circumstances of the Bennets while remaining appropriately Anglophilic in its attachment to the British countryside and country houses. In short, this new movie manages to convey the essence of the book nearly as well and just as movingly as the excellent A&E; series, which is twice as long.",5,Wonderful -- Charming Darcy,1144195200,"04 5, 2006",2006,3651,"['watched', '2005', 'film', '1995', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'close', 'together', 'time', 'are', 'wonderful', 'film', 'achieve', 'almost', 'same', 'effect', 'just', 'time', 'are', 'respectful', 'Austen', 'novel.The', 'new', 'film', 'version', 'very', 'very', 'fine', 'biggest', 'difference', 'two', 'space', 'allowed', 'develop', 'various', 'aspects', 'character', 'plot', 'i.e.', '95', 'TV', 'series', 'see', 'developments', 'Lizzie', 'AND', 'Darcy', 'points', 'view', 'see', 'flashback', 'sometimes', 'multiple', 'times', 'new', 'film', 'version', 'excellent', 'job', 'conveying', 'book', 'even', 'scenes', 'must', 'necessarily', 'be', 'omitted', 'flashbacks', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'are', 'easy', 'way', 'telegraphing', 'character', 'second', 'thoughts', 'really', 'good', 'actor', 'can', 'convey', 'doubt', 'complexity', 'assistance.The', 'hardest', 'character', 'actor', 'portray', 'Austen', 'novel', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'prideful', 'arrogant', 'aristocrat', 'who', 'bad', 'character', 'who', 'develops', 'becomes', 'good', 'good', 'character', 'who', 'outset', 'least', 'partly', 'misunderstood', 'evidence', 'support', 'interpretations', 'learn', 'family', 'including', 'servants', 'who', 'have', 'known', 'whole', 'life', 'admire', 'integrity', 'kindness', 'certainly', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'reason', 'outset', 'find', 'cold', 'distant', 'even', 'snobbish', 'However', 'terrific', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'representation', 'character', 'down', 'pretty', 'strongly', 'change', 'growth', 'Matthew', 'MacFadyen', 'hero', 'recent', 'film', 'sweetest', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'meet', 'question', 'open', 'reserve', 'beginning', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'chalked', 'up', 'shyness', 'Darcies', 'have', 'much', 'recommend', 'Even', 'Firth', 'more', 'impression', 'confidence', 'sharpness', 'got', 'Austen', 'novel', 'think', 'actually', 'prefer', 'sweetness', 'MacFadyen', 'who', 'better', 'job', 'convincing', 'actually', 'Elizabeth', 'attractive', 'beginning.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'actress', 'who', 'Elizabeth', '2005', 'film', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'name', 'sprightly', 'only', 'too', 'conveniently', 'credit', 'odd', 'energetic', 'way', 'Lizzie', 'Bennet', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'perhaps', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'true', 'book', 'Benjamin', 'Whitrow', 'A', 'E', 'version', 'As', 'much', 'admire', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'other', 'films', 'not', 'great', 'here', 'nothing', 'earlier', 'BBC', 'Bennet', 'mother', 'Alison', 'Steadman', 'who', 'more', 'perfectly', 'mother', 'hysterics', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'well', 'cast', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'Bourgh', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'regal', 'admirable', 'own', 'right', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'certain', 'reptilian', 'quality', 'Barbara', 'Leigh-Hunt', 'A', 'E', 'production', 'very', 'capably', 'Also', 'must', 'admit', 'Tom', 'Hollander', 'Mr.', 'Collins', '2005', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'simpering', 'skin-crawling', 'performance', 'David', 'Bamber', 'BBC', 'version', 'part', 'quibbles', 'however', 'makers', 'film', 'had', 'wits', 'Most', 'importantly', 'were', 'not', 'afraid', 'emotion', 'versions', 'end', 'very', 'satisfying', 'un-Austenlike', 'kiss.The', 'music', 'film', 'lush', 'engaging', 'landscape', 'notwithwithstanding', 'opinion', 'other', 'reviewers', 'constrained', 'circumstances', 'Bennets', 'remaining', 'appropriately', 'Anglophilic', 'attachment', 'British', 'countryside', 'country', 'houses', 'short', 'new', 'movie', 'convey', 'essence', 'book', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'as', 'movingly', 'excellent', 'A', 'E', 'series', 'twice', 'as', 'long']",N/A
641108,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B00005JOHI,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[4, 7]","""Pride and Prejudice,"" Joe Wright's adaptation of the Jane Austen classic, is peculiarly radient in that these sort of adaptations (for instance, the same novel's '95 television miniseries) are always done with an air of leisure, which is, unless handled well, simply another word for intense boredom; not to say director Wright cheapens the novel in any way. In fact, his luminosity only deepens what societal subtext there is, exciting and intriguing the senses with every frame. We can all from here on out exhale with relief at the thought of a period piece that does not meander but instead distills a piece of art to its exuberant soul while also providing an expansive emphasis on society, in this case Victorian-era Britain. Never are the bounds of marriage forgotten, or the lack of money, or the ridiculousness of romanticism in the context of Austen society (Charlotte, heroin Elizabeth Bennet's good friend, at some point says ""I can't afford to be romantic"" when defending her marriage to the sycophant Mr. Collins, a line that is all the more poignant coming from the fantastic Claudie Blakley).Perhaps what most distinguishes this version of the well-known tale of the Bennet sisters is the casting. I wholeheartedly call it perfect, with each daughter containg their aesthetic qualities and personality quirks as described in the novel. As with most British costume dramas, the supporting cast is pitch-perfect throughout, including Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. Matthew McFayden plays Darcy convincingly, which is important considering the emotional arc he's called the portray. The biggest surprise, however, is most certainly Keira Knightly, who I expected to be nothing short of a mess but instead gives off the sharp, modest beauty inherent in Elizabeth Bennet.In my recent essay on the novel ""Pride and Prejudice"" for AP Literature, I concluded in saying that above all Austen makes the point ""that all people deserve to love and deserve to be satisfied with who they are and who they grow to be."" Joe Wright's largest accomplishment is making me believe said message all over again.

641111,A1YQS7S1IE53SB,B00005JOHI,Wendy C. Rigney,"[139, 175]","In watching this version of Jane Austen's classic novel of love, marriage, and class distinctions of Regency England, all I could think of was that, while pleasing to the eye, Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen were less playing Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet than versions of Heathcliff and Catherine in Emily Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights"".Knightley's Elizabeth struck me as self important, dramatic, and smug rather than intelligent and full of life. Why was she always snarling, smiling, or generally baring her teeth? MacFadyen's Darcy, rather than proud, alternating between shyness and simply looking like he wanted to cry. Where was the pomposity? The disdain for others around him? I saw none of that.This is not even touching the appalling additions of such things as pigs in the living room and the generally unkempt appearance of the Bennets and their living situation. Mr. Bennet was a bookkeeper, a gentleman. The book states that the Bennets were ""not too poor"" and still managed to appear well mannered and well groomed despite the lack of funds. So the dirt and the farm animals were unneeded and had no point relevant to the ""Pride and Prejudice"" I have read. If they were that poor, what would be the point of the fuss made over Lizzie getting her skirt inches in mud on the way to visit Jane? There'd be nothing to remark on, because it would be the norm. And it is not.But back to ""Pride and Prejudice"" meets ""Wuthering Heights"". I get the idea was likely to appeal to the greater masses. But the Harlequinesque declarations and outright lack of propriety shown in the film - the flowing hair, the over the top emotion, the schmaltz - is counterproductive to the novel. I could buy the sap in ""Wuthering Heights"" because Heathcliff and Catherine were both so dramatic on their own that their romance and doom were highlighted by such actions. Mr. Darcy and Lizzie were more circumspect. No less passionate, but their passion lay in their mannerisms and their verbal sparring, not walking around in bare feet, nightgowns, or half-done shirts. No, no, no. Leave that to Emily Bronte, not Jane Austen.As for the rest, no way would single men visit sick single women when they are alone. Reputation, as was one point of the novel, meant everything. Such an action would be scandalous back in the day. A woman would NOT be seen with her hair down. Lizzie would not giggle endlessly and lick her fingers and act as silly as Lydia. No way would Mr. Darcy EVER deliver that letter in the way he did. And the first proposal: the book mentioned Charlotte's parlor. It should have been left at that. The rain was, again, more dramatic, but it did not fit for these characters, especially not at that juncture of their acquaintance. And no way would Lady Catherine go to Longbourn in the dead of night to have it out with Lizzie over her intentions for her nephew. It's all wrong.I am glad for those who enjoy this version, but if the filmmaker wanted over the top romance, he should have left Jane Austen alone and gone with the more lushly romantic aforementioned Emily Bronte. The Bronte-ization of ""Pride and Prejudice"" left me cold and diluted Jane Austen's observations about love, marriage, society, and money and turned the story into just another romance flick.

It very much reminded me of ""Sense & Sensibility"", which I also loved. I was fortunate, I guess you could say, that I have never read ""Pride & Prejudice"" so I was left in suspense as to whether Mr. Darcy & Elizabeth would ever be together. This certainly added to my pleasure of the movie. The movie allowed me to get to know all the characters. It definately drew out the romantic dreamer in me and I was crying at the end.

My favorite still remains the 1995 Colin Firth version, but this one is also a keeper. Kiera Knightley is wonderful as she has been so far in everything she has played. The scenery alone is well worth the price of the DVD. The settings give you a real flavor of the time - early 1800's - and the muddy way that people lived. No wonder the upper class were revolted by country manners - with a pig that size in the house? Brenda Blethyn does a wonderful job as Mrs. Bennett, as do the four sisters. But, for those of us who know the book by heart, this version is a disappointment. I miss many of the lines I love - they are either missing or thrown away in a mumble. The hair stylist should have done more research as should the writer - I agree that the 'faux pas' - Elizabeth running around in her nightgown - Darcy waltzing into the Collins' whenever he feels like it - are GLARING. It disrupts the reality for those of us who know the manners of that time better. But the real problem with it is Darcy - Darcy has to be cold and haughty, warm and shy, and sexy. MacFayden does angry and appalled, and little else. The director said that he did not want to cast someone too handsome and he certainly has followed through on that. MacFayden could have been cast as one of the farm hands much more easily. Love stories have to be believable - you have to believe that someone as great as Kiera Knightley is going to fall for the guy. With Orlando Bloom this works. But not here - such a shame. Lastly, although I like Donald Sutherland, he plays Mr. Bennett as though he on the edge of senility - Mr. Bennett has a lot of great lines in this story but I'm not surprised that other viewers didn't value them because Sutherland threw them away if he got to say them at all.

641127,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00005JOHI,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","I watched this 2005 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice some years ago and then forgot all about it. I guess I wasn't really paying attention to it, and decided to give it another go last night. Now, I am an ardent fan of the BBC adaptation starring Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet,Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996), and the other adaptation I have a fondness for is the one starring David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth Bennet,Pride and Prejudice (BBC, 1980). Both are faithful adaptations of the novel and I've worn out my DVDs watching them over and over whenever I have the time.This 2005 adaptation is a film version, so it is predictably an abridged version. It stars Keira Knightley (who does well in period dramas, e.g.The Duchess, andAtonement (Widescreen Edition)) as Elizabeth Bennet, and Matthew McFadyen as Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. Long-suffering Mr. Bennet is played by Donald Sutherland, and Mrs. Bennet is played by Brenda Blethyn. The other daughters are played by Rosamund Pike (Jane), Jena Malone (Lydia), Carey Mulligan (Kitty), and Talulah Riley (Mary). Elizabeth's best friend, Charlotte Lucas is played by Claudie Blakley (who went on to do an amazing job as Emma Timmins in the beloved BBC series Lark Rise and Candleford.So how does this film version measure up to the full-length BBC series? There is truly no comparison. Many liberties have been taken with the storyline such that the essence of the story is there, but many of the finer nuances of Austen's writing and social commentary is quite lost in translation. Both Knightley and McFadyen deliver credible performances, though Knightley's giggly and bewildered looks do tend to get a tad tiresome after awhile. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are sufficiently adequate in their roles, but the actors portraying them fail to capture the true essence of these two ridiculous characters, especially in Mrs. Bennet's case. Jena Malone also fails to convince as the flirty, silly, and impulsive Lydia Bennet (she really can't compare to Julia Sawalha's infuriatingly convincing performance in the 1996 BBC adaptation). The actor portraying Mr. Collins delivered a tepid performance. Luckily his counterpart in the movie, Charlotte Lucas nee Collins as played by Blakley, is compelling. Lady Catherine de Bourgh, the snobbish wannabe mother-in-law to Darcy, is well-played by Dame Judi Dench (who never fails to deliver in any of her roles).Despite these flaws and the liberties taken with the plot, I did like this adaptation because of several things. The two leads beguile viewers with their strong chemistry. There's a sexual tension between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy that practically simmers on-screen and draws viewers in. The love-hate relationship and longing that is so evident is credibly portrayed by the two leads, each look, gesture, etc. The cinematography is breathtaking. When I first saw Pemberley in this movie, it just about took my breath away (though the Pemberley featured in the 1996 BBC adaptation will always be my favorite). My favorite outdoors scene in this movie was of Elizabeth standing on the cliffs with the haunting music playing the background...it was just transcendent! Then there's the amazing score. The music is so perfect for this period drama, and Dawn is one of my favorites. The music is memorable and can very well be a classic, just as the score to the 1996 BBC adaptation is.All in all, I was glad I watched this again, and will add this adaptation to my Pride and Prejudice collection.",3,"3.5* - Many liberties taken here, but the chemistry between the leads sizzles!",1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,3569,"['watched', '2005', 'adaptation', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'forgot', 'guess', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'paying', 'attention', 'decided', 'give', 'go', 'last', 'night', 'Now', 'am', 'ardent', 'fan', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'starring', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Special', 'Edition', 'A', 'E', '1996', 'other', 'adaptation', 'have', 'fondness', 'one', 'starring', 'David', 'Rintoul', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Elizabeth', 'Garvie', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'BBC', '1980', 'are', 'faithful', 'adaptations', 'novel', ""'ve"", 'worn', 'out', 'DVDs', 'watching', 'whenever', 'have', 'time.This', '2005', 'adaptation', 'film', 'version', 'predictably', 'abridged', 'version', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'who', 'well', 'period', 'dramas', 'e.g.The', 'Duchess', 'andAtonement', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'Matthew', 'McFadyen', 'Mr.', 'Fitzwilliam', 'Darcy', 'Long-suffering', 'Mr.', 'Bennet', 'played', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'played', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'other', 'daughters', 'are', 'played', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'Jane', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'Lydia', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Kitty', 'Talulah', 'Riley', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'best', 'friend', 'Charlotte', 'Lucas', 'played', 'Claudie', 'Blakley', 'who', 'went', 'do', 'amazing', 'job', 'Emma', 'Timmins', 'beloved', 'BBC', 'series', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford.So', 'how', 'film', 'version', 'measure', 'full-length', 'BBC', 'series', 'truly', 'comparison', 'Many', 'liberties', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'storyline', 'such', 'essence', 'story', 'there', 'many', 'finer', 'nuances', 'Austen', 'writing', 'social', 'commentary', 'quite', 'lost', 'translation', 'Knightley', 'McFadyen', 'deliver', 'credible', 'performances', 'Knightley', 'giggly', 'bewildered', 'looks', 'do', 'tend', 'get', 'tad', 'tiresome', 'awhile', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'are', 'sufficiently', 'adequate', 'roles', 'actors', 'portraying', 'fail', 'capture', 'true', 'essence', 'two', 'ridiculous', 'characters', 'especially', 'Mrs.', 'Bennet', 'case', 'Jena', 'Malone', 'also', 'convince', 'flirty', 'silly', 'impulsive', 'Lydia', 'Bennet', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'Julia', 'Sawalha', 'infuriatingly', 'convincing', 'performance', '1996', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'actor', 'portraying', 'Mr.', 'Collins', 'delivered', 'tepid', 'performance', 'Luckily', 'counterpart', 'movie', 'Charlotte', 'Lucas', 'nee', 'Collins', 'played', 'Blakley', 'compelling', 'Lady', 'Catherine', 'de', 'Bourgh', 'snobbish', 'wannabe', 'mother-in-law', 'Darcy', 'well-played', 'Dame', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'who', 'never', 'deliver', 'roles', '.Despite', 'flaws', 'liberties', 'taken', 'plot', 'did', 'like', 'adaptation', 'several', 'things', 'two', 'leads', 'viewers', 'strong', 'chemistry', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Elizabeth', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'practically', 'simmers', 'on-screen', 'draws', 'viewers', 'love-hate', 'relationship', 'longing', 'so', 'evident', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'two', 'leads', 'look', 'gesture', 'etc', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'Pemberley', 'movie', 'just', 'took', 'breath', 'away', 'Pemberley', 'featured', '1996', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'favorite', 'favorite', 'outdoors', 'scene', 'movie', 'was', 'Elizabeth', 'standing', 'cliffs', 'haunting', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'was', 'just', 'transcendent', 'Then', 'amazing', 'score', 'music', 'so', 'perfect', 'period', 'drama', 'Dawn', 'one', 'favorites', 'music', 'memorable', 'can', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'classic', 'just', 'score', '1996', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'is.All', 'was', 'glad', 'watched', 'again', 'will', 'add', 'adaptation', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'collection']",N/A

If you are not a reader and are not a fan of Jane Austen, then you might find this somewhat amusing. I guess. I wouldn't know because I was so outraged by this ""adaptation."" I like to think of it more as an abomination, because that's what it is. The costumes are awful, the writer's and actors' interpretations of the characters is dreadful, and the whole thing is a hideous mess of a movie.Keira Knightley is fine in movies like ""Bend it Like Beckham"" and ""Pirates,"" but she cannot carry a true period drama. (By the way, is anyone else distracted by her mouth? It is CONSTANTLY open -- watch for it in ""Pirates"" as well). Darcy, Bingley, and the Bennett parents barely resemble the characters as Austen wrote them, and Wickham is hardly present! There is NO chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy either. Ugh, the whole thing is just terrible.Do yourself a favor and watch (or re-watch) the A&E; BBC version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. Okay, so they made up the scene with Darcy at the pond, but it's a pardonable (and saucy) addition to an otherwise extremely faithful and beautiful rendition of Pride and Prejudice. If you haven't seen the BBC version, by all means skip the Keira Knightley debacle and go straight to the real thing!",1,An Abomination,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,1544,"['Okay', 'here', 'deal', 'have', 'read', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'loved', 'do', 'NOT', 'watch', 'movie', 'want', 'go', 'unrewarding', 'emotional', 'journey', 'first', 'will', 'hoot', 'laughing', 'then', 'cry', 'despair', 'then', 'become', 'angry', 'hurl', 'insults', 'possibly', 'rotten', 'garbage', 'dvd', 'player', 'are', 'not', 'reader', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'Jane', 'Austen', 'then', 'might', 'find', 'somewhat', 'amusing', 'guess', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'so', 'outraged', 'adaptation', 'like', 'think', 'more', 'abomination', 'what', 'costumes', 'are', 'awful', 'writer', 'actors', 'interpretations', 'characters', 'dreadful', 'whole', 'thing', 'hideous', 'mess', 'movie.Keira', 'Knightley', 'fine', 'movies', 'Bend', 'Beckham', 'Pirates', 'can', 'not', 'carry', 'true', 'period', 'drama', 'way', 'anyone', 'else', 'distracted', 'mouth', 'CONSTANTLY', 'open', 'watch', 'Pirates', 'as', 'well', 'Darcy', 'Bingley', 'Bennett', 'parents', 'barely', 'resemble', 'characters', 'Austen', 'wrote', 'Wickham', 'hardly', 'present', 'chemistry', 'Lizzie', 'Darcy', 'either', 'Ugh', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'terrible.Do', 'favor', 'watch', 're-watch', 'A', 'E', 'BBC', 'version', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Okay', 'made', 'up', 'scene', 'Darcy', 'pond', 'pardonable', 'saucy', 'addition', 'otherwise', 'extremely', 'faithful', 'beautiful', 'rendition', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'BBC', 'version', 'means', 'skip', 'Keira', 'Knightley', 'debacle', 'go', 'straight', 'real', 'thing']",N/A
