It's a collection of a dozen vintage (and I do mean vintage) serials. Don't buy this for the relatively cheap price and expect remastered quality. The quality on most is rough. But these are fun to watch -- unintentionally funny, in some cases. My biggest complaint is the selection -- these aren't the top-notch serials you'd hope for. No Flash Gordon, for example. And three John Wayne serials? But for the price, you can't go wrong.",4,Serial lovers heaven,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",2007,486,"['love', 'serials', 'definitely', 'need', 'one', 'collection', 'dozen', 'vintage', 'do', 'mean', 'vintage', 'serials', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'relatively', 'cheap', 'price', 'expect', 'remastered', 'quality', 'quality', 'most', 'rough', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'cases', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'selection', 'are', ""n't"", 'top-notch', 'serials', ""'d"", 'hope', 'Flash', 'Gordon', 'example', 'three', 'John', 'Wayne', 'serials', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong']",N/A

We're talking the Perils of Pauline here, not Macbeth.  Well, actually, Macbeth is pretty unbelievable too, and has it's own share of cliffhangers, if it were shown in episodes.  So these are pretty bad.  Good.  I remember watching them one week at a time on saturday afternoons before whatever bad 50's sci-fi movie that was to follow, accompanied by hooting and popcorn throwing.

805652,A3TQHV255WD87C,B0001HAGW4,"M. Standish ""G. M.""","[2, 2]","If you love old cliffhanger serials from the 30's and 40's -- you know.....those 15 minute mini-movies that preceded the main attraction, and were usually cut up into 12 or 15 parts designed to entice you back to the theatre every week to see the new main attraction, AND to see if the hero lived to fight another day, because they always left you hanging right as his car plunged over a cliff, etc., etc.  They were very effective.  If any of you have read Hardy Boy or Nancy Drew books, you'll know exactly how cliffhangers worked.  Real ""pager-turners"".  Their production values always left something to be desired because most of them looked like they were working with a hundred dollar budget, but they usually had one or two relatively big 'B' names starring in them, and audiences back in those days weren't nearly as demanding as we are today with 300 million dollar budgets now par for the course.  Just to give you an idea of the stars, this set has three serials starring a very young and handsome John Wayne, Bela Lugosi, Ralph Byrd (Dick Tracy), William Boyd and others.  Half the charm in these things in that they're a little on the corny side, and some of the acting leaves something to be desired.  Just the same, I've practically worn my set out watching them over and over.  That's the nice thing about DVDs.  Take good care of them, and they'll never wear out.  This set comes in a nice velcro-lidded box, with sturdy sleeves to protect the discs.  12 different serials in this one set!  One serial per single-sided disc.  All very different, and all very entertaining in their own unique way.  I'll be passing my set onto one or both of my daughters one of these days -- about the time I'm not up to watching them any longer, and when they're old enough to be turned off by whatever their kids are watching and/or listening to, and they're starting to long for things from a simpler, less foul time!  It doesn't appear that much of any remastering of the picture or sound has been performed by TreeLine Films, but they've gotten hold of the best original sources available and made commendable copies of them.  I don't expect great quality from old kinescope series that are pushing 80 years old in numerous instances, but I do find them all to be immensely watchable when I consider that many of these were shot during the Great Depression, with hand-crank cameras in some instances, and were directed by men wearing knicker-bockers and weilding old-fashioned bullhorns to call ""action"" and ""cut""!  Oh, and the great old cars!  What would these old serials be without them?!?  They take you back to a time when our parents were just kids, if that!  Wonderful stuff.  A great collection of some of the most famous serials of that era.  A terrific way to escape modern day for awhile.",5,For Cliffhanger Lovers!!,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,2804,"['love', 'old', 'cliffhanger', 'serials', '30', '40', 'know', '..those', '15', 'minute', 'mini-movies', 'preceded', 'main', 'attraction', 'were', 'usually', 'cut', 'up', '12', '15', 'parts', 'designed', 'entice', 'back', 'theatre', 'week', 'see', 'new', 'main', 'attraction', 'see', 'hero', 'lived', 'fight', 'day', 'always', 'left', 'hanging', 'right', 'car', 'plunged', 'cliff', 'etc.', 'etc', 'were', 'very', 'effective', 'have', 'read', 'Hardy', 'Boy', 'Nancy', 'Drew', 'books', ""'ll"", 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'cliffhangers', 'worked', 'Real', 'pager-turners', 'production', 'values', 'always', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'most', 'looked', 'were', 'working', 'hundred', 'dollar', 'budget', 'usually', 'had', 'one', 'two', 'relatively', 'big', 'B', 'names', 'starring', 'audiences', 'back', 'days', 'were', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'demanding', 'are', 'today', '300', 'million', 'dollar', 'budgets', 'now', 'par', 'course', 'Just', 'give', 'idea', 'stars', 'set', 'three', 'serials', 'starring', 'very', 'young', 'handsome', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Bela', 'Lugosi', 'Ralph', 'Byrd', 'Dick', 'Tracy', 'William', 'Boyd', 'others', 'charm', 'things', ""'re"", 'little', 'corny', 'side', 'acting', 'leaves', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'Just', 'same', ""'ve"", 'practically', 'worn', 'set', 'out', 'watching', 'over', 'nice', 'thing', 'DVDs', 'Take', 'good', 'care', ""'ll"", 'never', 'wear', 'out', 'set', 'nice', 'velcro-lidded', 'box', 'sturdy', 'sleeves', 'protect', 'discs', '12', 'different', 'serials', 'one', 'set', 'One', 'serial', 'single-sided', 'disc', 'very', 'different', 'very', 'entertaining', 'own', 'unique', 'way', ""'ll"", 'be', 'passing', 'set', 'one', 'daughters', 'one', 'days', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'watching', 'longer', 'when', ""'re"", 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'kids', 'are', 'watching', 'and/or', 'listening', ""'re"", 'starting', 'long', 'things', 'simpler', 'less', 'foul', 'time', ""n't"", 'appear', 'much', 'remastering', 'picture', 'sound', 'been', 'performed', 'TreeLine', 'Films', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'hold', 'best', 'original', 'sources', 'available', 'made', 'commendable', 'copies', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'quality', 'old', 'kinescope', 'series', 'are', 'pushing', '80', 'years', 'old', 'numerous', 'instances', 'do', 'find', 'be', 'immensely', 'watchable', 'when', 'consider', 'many', 'were', 'shot', 'Great', 'Depression', 'hand-crank', 'cameras', 'instances', 'were', 'directed', 'men', 'wearing', 'knicker-bockers', 'weilding', 'old-fashioned', 'bullhorns', 'call', 'action', 'cut', 'Oh', 'great', 'old', 'cars', 'What', 'would', 'old', 'serials', 'be', 'take', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'parents', 'were', 'just', 'kids', 'Wonderful', 'stuff', 'great', 'collection', 'most', 'famous', 'serials', 'era', 'terrific', 'way', 'escape', 'modern', 'day', 'awhile']",N/A
