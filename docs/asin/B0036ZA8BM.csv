Starting with the box set before we get to the anime. Funimation, would you please care about your product as much as we the consumer does. I mean come on! You screwed up by putting vegeta on the cover of disc 1 and raditz on disc 2; he's not even in disc 2. Gez.2. The opening sequences, ""commercial"" breaks, closing sequences are amazing animation. I wish they would of done it that way, I didn't even know what to expect, I thought it was going to be that type of animation like the 1 for that dbz movie with vegetas little brother table. But oh well I guess they didn't want to. It would've put a whole new feel to it and would of been like watching a brand new  dbz.3. it's Watching dbz in fast forward. Which is fine and all but its kinda weird from watching the original so many times to this.Likes1. If you don't have time to watch all of the episodes normally, this is a great way to get your fill and fix.2. Dying for a dbz fix, want to watch that amazing fight sequence, you won't have to look far and skip through scenes and episodes just to get to the beef of the action, it's pretty much here.3. Feels like the manga is being flip booked for me with dialogue and action nd everything.So all in all ill take the good with the bad, its dbz there's not much to ever hate about it. (Except for you gohan who decides to turn ink saiyaman and not be a major bad ass like we know you could of been.) Anyways, lol in the end dbz is dbz an ill take all I can get from the 20 + old series.",4,"Good, but with flaws.",1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,1576,"['Ok', 'so', ""'ll"", 'list', 'likes', 'dislikes', 'starting', 'dislikesDislikes1', 'Starting', 'box', 'set', 'get', 'anime', 'Funimation', 'would', 'please', 'care', 'product', 'as', 'much', 'consumer', 'mean', 'come', 'screwed', 'up', 'putting', 'vegeta', 'cover', 'disc', '1', 'raditz', 'disc', '2', 'not', 'even', 'disc', '2', 'Gez.2', 'opening', 'sequences', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'closing', 'sequences', 'are', 'amazing', 'animation', 'wish', 'would', 'done', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'type', 'animation', '1', 'dbz', 'movie', 'vegetas', 'little', 'brother', 'table', 'oh', 'well', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'would', ""'ve"", 'put', 'whole', 'new', 'feel', 'would', 'been', 'watching', 'brand', 'new', 'dbz.3', 'Watching', 'dbz', 'fast', 'forward', 'Which', 'fine', 'kinda', 'weird', 'watching', 'original', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'this.Likes1', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'watch', 'episodes', 'normally', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'fill', 'fix.2', 'Dying', 'dbz', 'fix', 'want', 'watch', 'amazing', 'fight', 'sequence', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'far', 'skip', 'scenes', 'episodes', 'just', 'get', 'beef', 'action', 'pretty', 'much', 'here.3', 'Feels', 'manga', 'being', 'flip', 'booked', 'dialogue', 'action', 'nd', 'everything.So', 'ill', 'take', 'good', 'bad', 'dbz', 'not', 'much', 'ever', 'hate', 'gohan', 'who', 'turn', 'ink', 'saiyaman', 'not', 'be', 'major', 'bad', 'ass', 'know', 'could', 'been', 'Anyways', 'lol', 'end', 'dbz', 'dbz', 'ill', 'take', 'can', 'get', '20', '+', 'old', 'series']",N/A

I've read reviews and people are saying ""OH, THIS IS BETTER BECAUSE WE CAN WATCH IT HOW IT WAS INTENDED TO BE"" That is so goofy to me. If you own the other sets and you're some Dragonball nerd, expert guy then just skip past the episodes you know are filler if it bothers you so much. I don't see why you would do that though because you understand the characters more with the extra content. If you don't like the filler episodes read the freaking manga. (Which you probably already have, but just like to be annoying)I love how they put ""Z"" on the box. I'm sure Funi did this because they think it will give this release better sales but I think it's going to do the opposite.

1329393,A2551AOGTAT81S,B0036ZA8BM,Mike J.,"[15, 24]","I think my expectation toward this newly-revised classic series is just like everybody else hoping a better, faster and cleaner episodes of DBZ. Unfortunately, this new-born DBZ:Kai has ironically proved that it has no match to its original dragging-long series, which is still much better than this lazy-attempt yet overpriced product. To sum it up briefly, the major problem with DBZ: Kai is that it's lost too many essential elements from the original series and ultimately failed to make it a better, concise and filler-free series as it should be. They skipped way too much! I am happy that they try to remove any unnecessary episodes, but it seems they fail to realize the difference between good-filler episodes and the bad ones. In this case they have pathetically taken away those good episodes that are relevant to the main story and as such, it comes off as incohensive and senseless.For example, (CONTAIN SPOILERS) they cut out the parts where the original has explained Yamcha's, Tien's and the other Z-fighers' whereabouts after Goku was killed by his brother and Kami is summoming the Z-fighters to train in order to help defend the two up-coming super-strong Seiyans whose objective is to destroy the Earth. In Kai, these parts were cut and the next episode quickly shows Yamcha and the other Z-fighters show up on the Kami's place to train without giving enough details where they were and what they were doing and how they feel about or learn about the current situation etc; furthermore, they also cut out the parts where explain in the original that how Bulma or Master Roshi gathered the scattered dragon balls from all over the world in an attempt to bring back Goku's life in the future. However, in kai we didn't know they have found all the balls until the very last moment that Roshi needs to summon the dragon to bring back Goku. This scene appears too sudden and gives no explaination. The original doesn't take too long to explain how they found the balls but at least it has provided a course of action to explain; in addition, Gohan, before he officially accepted to be trained by Piccalo, was a wimp who is scared of fighting. After he saw the Moon the first time and transformed into a giant ape, Piccalo managed to prevent Gohan's destruction by destroying the Moon, and he gave the fainted Gohan new clothing and a sword in both versions but in kai, we didn't get to see how Gohan realized the differences, how he overcame his fears to fight and what make him accept Piccaolo's training etc. Again they cut off the interesting and necessary parts in order to favor the action scenes only. The original series may be long, but it provides enough detailing to be a complete story. Personally I enjoy seeing how Goku overcomes a number of obstacles on the Snakeway before reaching King Kai's planet. This is because it shows how hard it is to run on the Snakeway; othewise, it would be too easy and not even make sense.  In kai, Goku mentioned that he had run on the Snakeway for 6 months, but we don't get to see the course of hardships, obstacles or frustrations that he had to go through. As a result, the efforts he made for finally reaching King Kai's planet has come off LESS convincing or admirable than the original series. Therefore, for the sake of speed, they have done a decent job shortening the series, but as being a complete, understandable, cohensive story, they have failed Kai miserably.Moreover, I don't really care for the change of voice actors as I appreciate all of their works and styles. However, i do prefer the old Gohan's voice a bit more as I found the new Gohan's voice a bit irritating.Lastly, the new music isn't as great as before. The original music just has such a classic and iconic feel, but with Kai, I just don't feel the same way. Nothing special, maybe because it's new and the lack of time to get used to it. Visually I don't see any differences or improvements that they have done for kai either. But it's not a very big issue for me.Overall, I think kai is more suitable for new fans who have never seen the original as they don't have the previous knowledge to compare and as a result, they will be more appreciated by it. However, for those who enjoy the original series, they'd better stay away from it. Not only Kai fails to live up to their expectation, but also they are charged for one product way too much and it's not even that good to begin with.",2,They Overdid It!,1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,4433,"['think', 'expectation', 'newly-revised', 'classic', 'series', 'just', 'everybody', 'else', 'hoping', 'better', 'faster', 'cleaner', 'episodes', 'DBZ', 'Unfortunately', 'new-born', 'DBZ', 'Kai', 'ironically', 'proved', 'match', 'original', 'dragging-long', 'series', 'still', 'much', 'better', 'lazy-attempt', 'yet', 'overpriced', 'product', 'sum', 'up', 'briefly', 'major', 'problem', 'DBZ', 'Kai', 'lost', 'too', 'many', 'essential', 'elements', 'original', 'series', 'ultimately', 'failed', 'make', 'better', 'concise', 'filler-free', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'skipped', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'am', 'happy', 'try', 'remove', 'unnecessary', 'episodes', 'fail', 'realize', 'difference', 'good-filler', 'episodes', 'bad', 'ones', 'case', 'have', 'pathetically', 'taken', 'away', 'good', 'episodes', 'are', 'relevant', 'main', 'story', 'such', 'off', 'incohensive', 'senseless.For', 'example', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERS', 'cut', 'out', 'parts', 'where', 'original', 'explained', 'Yamcha', 'Tien', 'other', 'Z-fighers', 'whereabouts', 'Goku', 'was', 'killed', 'brother', 'Kami', 'summoming', 'Z-fighters', 'train', 'order', 'help', 'defend', 'two', 'up-coming', 'super-strong', 'Seiyans', 'objective', 'destroy', 'Earth', 'Kai', 'parts', 'were', 'cut', 'next', 'episode', 'quickly', 'Yamcha', 'other', 'Z-fighters', 'show', 'up', 'Kami', 'place', 'train', 'giving', 'enough', 'details', 'where', 'were', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'how', 'feel', 'learn', 'current', 'situation', 'etc', 'furthermore', 'also', 'cut', 'out', 'parts', 'where', 'explain', 'original', 'how', 'Bulma', 'Master', 'Roshi', 'gathered', 'scattered', 'dragon', 'balls', 'world', 'attempt', 'bring', 'back', 'Goku', 'life', 'future', 'However', 'kai', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'have', 'found', 'balls', 'very', 'last', 'moment', 'Roshi', 'summon', 'dragon', 'bring', 'back', 'Goku', 'scene', 'too', 'sudden', 'explaination', 'original', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'long', 'explain', 'how', 'found', 'balls', 'least', 'provided', 'course', 'action', 'explain', 'addition', 'Gohan', 'officially', 'accepted', 'be', 'trained', 'Piccalo', 'was', 'wimp', 'who', 'scared', 'fighting', 'saw', 'Moon', 'first', 'time', 'transformed', 'giant', 'ape', 'Piccalo', 'managed', 'prevent', 'Gohan', 'destruction', 'destroying', 'Moon', 'gave', 'fainted', 'Gohan', 'new', 'clothing', 'sword', 'versions', 'kai', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Gohan', 'realized', 'differences', 'how', 'overcame', 'fears', 'fight', 'what', 'make', 'accept', 'Piccaolo', 'training', 'etc', 'Again', 'cut', 'off', 'interesting', 'necessary', 'parts', 'order', 'favor', 'action', 'only', 'original', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'long', 'enough', 'detailing', 'be', 'complete', 'story', 'Personally', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'how', 'Goku', 'number', 'obstacles', 'Snakeway', 'reaching', 'King', 'Kai', 'planet', 'how', 'hard', 'run', 'Snakeway', 'othewise', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'easy', 'not', 'even', 'make', 'sense', 'kai', 'Goku', 'mentioned', 'had', 'run', 'Snakeway', '6', 'months', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'course', 'hardships', 'obstacles', 'frustrations', 'had', 'go', 'through', 'result', 'efforts', 'made', 'finally', 'reaching', 'King', 'Kai', 'planet', 'come', 'off', 'LESS', 'convincing', 'admirable', 'original', 'series', 'Therefore', 'sake', 'speed', 'have', 'done', 'decent', 'job', 'shortening', 'series', 'being', 'complete', 'understandable', 'cohensive', 'story', 'have', 'failed', 'Kai', 'miserably.Moreover', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'change', 'voice', 'actors', 'appreciate', 'works', 'styles', 'However', 'i', 'do', 'prefer', 'old', 'Gohan', 'voice', 'bit', 'more', 'found', 'new', 'Gohan', 'voice', 'bit', 'irritating.Lastly', 'new', 'music', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'before', 'original', 'music', 'just', 'such', 'classic', 'iconic', 'feel', 'Kai', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'Nothing', 'special', 'maybe', 'new', 'lack', 'time', 'get', 'used', 'Visually', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'differences', 'improvements', 'have', 'done', 'kai', 'either', 'not', 'very', 'big', 'issue', 'me.Overall', 'think', 'more', 'suitable', 'new', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'compare', 'result', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'appreciated', 'However', 'who', 'enjoy', 'original', 'series', ""'d"", 'better', 'stay', 'away', 'Not', 'only', 'Kai', 'live', 'up', 'expectation', 'also', 'are', 'charged', 'one', 'product', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'even', 'that', 'good', 'begin']",N/A

1329395,A13L7XH3VFBLNV,B0036ZA8BM,MoonLiteStar88,"[1, 2]","I've been an avid DBZ fan since I was 8 years old (22 now). Ever since I heard DBKai was coming out on DVD I immediately got myself a copy. I bought my DVD copy yesterday and I gotta say, the english dub is a lot better than I expected it to be (the Japanese version is still awesome of course)! :) Anyways, now let's get to the review of the actual product.Packaging: Comes with 2 thinpak DVD cases with 1 DVD in each case. DVD cases fit tightly but not too tight. The set conatins episodes 1-13.Features: Each episode contains the opening and ending themes along with the next episode previews and episode review. Opening and Closing themes have been re-animated into modern style anime. The show itself uses the old footage from Z but is remastered. Most of the background images have been redrawn and some new scenes have been added into the later episodes of Kai. Most filler has been removed which will shorten the show to about 150 at most according to Toei. The Kai Soundtrack has not been changed in the English dub version. Episodes are presented in Full Screen. There is no option for WideScreen (boo!). Contains Japanese and English audio with english subtitles.Video Quality: Quality is excelent and clear. There are some blurry spots on the main menus but I haven't had that problem anywhere else. Wish I had the Blu-Ray version to compare the two. But I'd say the DVD version is amazing.Overall: The English dub is amazing. The only voice I found annoying was King Kai's. I don't like that Schemmel made him more raspy. It was fine as it was before. I'm really just not a fan of raspy voices I guess. :/ As far as Gohan's voice goes, it's really not bad at all. There are times when I hear a girl's or Luffy's voice. Otherwise, Colleen is doing pretty well voicing him. And Rial sounds pretty much the same as Bulma's old voice actress. I'm very glad that I bought this series.Warning for parents: This is not the NickToons edited version. This uses raw footage from Japan which hasn't been as heavily edited as the NickToons version. This show is rated PG, however there are a few bad words used such as die, crap and damn. I would suggest this for kids 12 and up.Episode list:DVD 1:1. Prologue to Battle! The Return of Goku!2.

Sharpe ""Ghostbusters!""","[2, 4]","I've only watched the TV version of these Kai episodes and there are several things I like better and things I don't like as much and things I don't like at all. And this is a review for the entire Dragonball Z Kai thing not just part one.the things I like better: redrawn animation, some of the animation is redrawn and much ""pretty"" I guess you could say. but most of the original artwork is used, I mean they couldn't redraw the whole thing. The story and the episodes move a lot faster and they're more to the point. they cut out long drawn out sections that had nothing to do with the story at all so it's I guess roughly 100 episodes? if you see that wrong please tell me and show me where a full list of episodes is in a link, thank you:) in the earlier episodes a lot of the colors were redone so you know what color they actually are instead of say for instance, vegeta and Nappa's armor is some funky brown orange and Yellow when hearing Raditz over his radio in the original and in this the colors are like normal saiyan armor. things like that.the things I don't like as much: some of the voices sound different but are the same people actors. they completely cut the Garlic Jr. saga, I didn't like this as much because you got to see Gohan show his powers off a good bit, although it wasn't missed, that and the great saiyaman saga were the worst of all.the things I don't like at all: There isn't near as much violence if any at all, where there is violence it's filled in with the same color as the skin is. even Cartoon network showed more violence than this. Many of the bad guys' voices are different, didn't like that much because I guess I was just use to the other ones. 95% of ALL the dialogue is different and that's annoying to me because sometimes they'd change what they were talking about completely. It also looks like they did not put the Buu saga in here since that's my favorite saga just because it should've ended at the Cell saga and Goku goes super Saiyan 3.those are my opinions on the Dragonball Z Kai thing. pretty good, ok, not all bad, plenty of action too. recommended for the beginner because of less long Grunting sessions which I kinda enjoyed because of the anticipation of the fight. for a true fan such as myself just watch the originals online.",4,Not all Bad...

I like the filler though but I also enjoy it without filler.
