Loved the kissing scenes...sigh, I am such a romantic...bring it on!Seemed to jump ahead a bit, would have liked to see Andrew come more slowly to the realisation that he wanted Joe big time, Joe was already there.  It hinted that there had been something previously but would have liked to see it.  There is a scene in Deleted Scenes feature but didn't add a lot.What I don't understand is the Tim character, well I do...abused boy, still with abuser after many years...one really f**ked up young man.  BUT what was the deal with him standing over the prone figure of a beaten up guy who had FAG written on his forehead and was dying from a beating (I think he was dying)?  He didn't finish him off but he kissed him, with a plank of wood in his hand.  Then he ran off when disturbed...thought he did the beating then wasn't sure.  Then when Joe and Andrew dump the abuser in the same spot with FAG written on his forehead he sees him and stops and...?  Can the next reviewer clear this up for me please - you might be a bit more observant and could pick up the nuances?I think the inclusion of intolerance is realistic - although that didn't come up in Joe and Andrew's circle because there was no chance to see them in that context after the girls demanded they DO IT.What is a bit disturbing is the inclusion of pedophiles (the fat man) in the gay club scene (pedophiles like young kids/youth (because they are SICK), not 20's etc)...there is already a perception in the land of red-necked-bigots that gay men want young fresh meat and have no scruples about age (lock up your kids coz the fags (hate that word!!!!) will be in quick if you aren't watching) which is not true...did this movie have to include it?  Not that the re-necked-bigots would be watching but others do.  Yeah I know it is based on fact...but still....So conclusion: didn't hate it, loved the kissing scene, could do better.",3,Didn't hate it...can someone explain it to me?,1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,1998,"['Ok', 'liked', 'premise', 'Loved', 'friends', 'realising', 'are', 'gay', 'hot', 'other', 'Loved', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'sigh', 'am', 'romantic', 'bring', 'Seemed', 'jump', 'ahead', 'bit', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'Andrew', 'come', 'more', 'slowly', 'realisation', 'wanted', 'Joe', 'big', 'time', 'Joe', 'was', 'already', 'there', 'hinted', 'had', 'been', 'something', 'previously', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'scene', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'feature', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'lot.What', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Tim', 'character', 'well', 'do', 'abused', 'boy', 'still', 'abuser', 'many', 'years', 'one', 'really', 'f**ked', 'up', 'young', 'man', 'BUT', 'what', 'was', 'deal', 'standing', 'prone', 'figure', 'beaten', 'up', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'FAG', 'written', 'forehead', 'was', 'dying', 'beating', 'think', 'was', 'dying', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'off', 'kissed', 'plank', 'wood', 'hand', 'Then', 'ran', 'off', 'when', 'disturbed', 'thought', 'did', 'beating', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'Then', 'when', 'Joe', 'Andrew', 'dump', 'abuser', 'same', 'spot', 'FAG', 'written', 'forehead', 'stops', 'Can', 'next', 'reviewer', 'clear', 'up', 'please', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'observant', 'could', 'pick', 'up', 'nuances', 'think', 'inclusion', 'intolerance', 'realistic', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'Joe', 'Andrew', 'circle', 'was', 'chance', 'see', 'context', 'girls', 'demanded', 'DO', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'inclusion', 'pedophiles', 'fat', 'man', 'gay', 'club', 'scene', 'pedophiles', 'young', 'kids/youth', 'are', 'SICK', 'not', '20', 'etc', 'already', 'perception', 'land', 'red-necked-bigots', 'gay', 'men', 'want', 'young', 'fresh', 'meat', 'have', 'scruples', 'age', 'lock', 'up', 'kids', 'coz', 'fags', 'hate', 'word', 'will', 'be', 'quick', 'are', ""n't"", 'watching', 'not', 'true', 'did', 'movie', 'have', 'include', 'Not', 're-necked-bigots', 'would', 'be', 'watching', 'others', 'do', 'Yeah', 'know', 'based', 'fact', 'still', '.So', 'conclusion', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'loved', 'kissing', 'scene', 'could', 'do', 'better']",Vacationland
1018486,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B000I2J5TW,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[17, 19]","""Vacationland"" (2006) tells the story of Joe, an 18 year old high school senior in Bangor, Maine who longs to move away from poor white trash roots and this town, with a dream of attending art school.  He gets a job as the live in caretaker (and occasional nude model) for an elderly disabled artist, while also working part time at a local market along with his sister, who wants to get out of town as much as he does.  For most of high school, Joe has also had a crush on his best friend, Andrew, who plays on the high school football team, and uses alcohol to try to relax with girls, but who actually feels the same way about Joe.  Two girls they dated eventually convince them to explore their mutual attraction for each other. and they also check out the local gay disco.  Joe is secure about his sexuality and his plans for school, although he has no idea where the money will come from, while Andrew continues to drink heavily while trying to reconcile what he wants to do with the rest of his life, and if Joe should be a part of it.  One night, a face out of Joe's past returns to haunt him, and brings to the surface feelings he thought were long buried.This dark, broodingly emotional coming-of-age film was directed and co-written by Todd Verow, as a semi-autobiographical memoir of growing up in Maine.  Newcomer Brad Hallowell (as Joe) does a commendable job breathing life into a character that isn't written very well, while the rest of the cast (including Gregory Lucas as Andrew) appears to be trying for the ""Overacting Hall of Fame.""  The photography is good, except for the amateurish and distracting title credits, but the sound has problems (narration with a deep echo often drowned out by too-loud background music.) The significance of the title is a mystery, and I can only guess the town is supposed to be some kind of vacation destination, though that is far from evident in the film.  DVD extras include a few deleted scenes and a trailer, no commentary.  I'll give it three stars out of five.",3,Dark film explores coming of age and shadows of past,1164758400,"11 29, 2006",2006,2023,"['Vacationland', '2006', 'story', 'Joe', '18', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'Bangor', 'Maine', 'who', 'move', 'away', 'poor', 'white', 'trash', 'roots', 'town', 'dream', 'attending', 'art', 'school', 'job', 'live', 'caretaker', 'occasional', 'nude', 'model', 'elderly', 'disabled', 'artist', 'also', 'working', 'part', 'time', 'local', 'market', 'sister', 'who', 'get', 'town', 'as', 'much', 'most', 'high', 'school', 'Joe', 'also', 'had', 'crush', 'best', 'friend', 'Andrew', 'who', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'alcohol', 'try', 'relax', 'girls', 'who', 'actually', 'same', 'way', 'Joe', 'Two', 'girls', 'dated', 'eventually', 'convince', 'explore', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'other', 'also', 'check', 'out', 'local', 'gay', 'disco', 'Joe', 'secure', 'sexuality', 'plans', 'school', 'idea', 'where', 'money', 'will', 'come', 'Andrew', 'drink', 'heavily', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'what', 'do', 'rest', 'life', 'Joe', 'should', 'be', 'part', 'One', 'night', 'face', 'Joe', 'past', 'returns', 'haunt', 'surface', 'feelings', 'thought', 'were', 'long', 'buried.This', 'dark', 'broodingly', 'emotional', 'coming-of-age', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'co-written', 'Todd', 'Verow', 'semi-autobiographical', 'memoir', 'growing', 'up', 'Maine', 'Newcomer', 'Brad', 'Hallowell', 'Joe', 'commendable', 'job', 'breathing', 'life', 'character', ""n't"", 'written', 'very', 'well', 'rest', 'cast', 'including', 'Gregory', 'Lucas', 'Andrew', 'be', 'trying', 'Overacting', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'photography', 'good', 'amateurish', 'distracting', 'title', 'credits', 'sound', 'problems', 'narration', 'deep', 'echo', 'often', 'drowned', 'out', 'too-loud', 'background', 'music', 'significance', 'title', 'mystery', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'town', 'supposed', 'be', 'kind', 'vacation', 'destination', 'far', 'evident', 'film', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'trailer', 'commentary', ""'ll"", 'give', 'three', 'five']",Vacationland
1018487,A1KZPPG5KTVST8,B000I2J5TW,c. j. pierson,"[0, 1]","I haven't always been a fan of Todd Verow, he seems like one of those directors you either love or hate. Im still undecided but so far, I think this may have been one of my favorites of his. I wasn't crazy about it but at least it had somewhat of real storyline and actual actors this time. I fell inlove with these characters a bit although I wished they could have been more fleshed out. I still understand what the footballer's problem was. Ok, so his girlfriend figured out he was gay and blackmailed him but she also let him have his cake and eat it too. And yes, so his parents kicked him out but what I didn't get is why he didn't just go live with his boyfriend? And WTF was that with the weirdo art guy anyway??? Then the tale of the other boyfriend who was attacked when he younger comes to light and that's when things got a little too weird for me. But aside from that, I thought these two actors had a good chemistry, even if at times it seemed tense for no apparent reason and the storyline could have done with some tweaking and brushing.",2,It was not BAD,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,1053,"['have', ""n't"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Todd', 'Verow', 'one', 'directors', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'Im', 'still', 'undecided', 'so', 'far', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'favorites', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'least', 'had', 'somewhat', 'real', 'storyline', 'actual', 'actors', 'time', 'fell', 'inlove', 'characters', 'bit', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fleshed', 'still', 'understand', 'what', 'footballer', 'problem', 'was', 'Ok', 'girlfriend', 'figured', 'out', 'was', 'gay', 'blackmailed', 'also', 'let', 'have', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'yes', 'parents', 'kicked', 'out', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'live', 'boyfriend', 'WTF', 'was', 'weirdo', 'art', 'guy', 'anyway', 'Then', 'tale', 'other', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'was', 'attacked', 'when', 'younger', 'light', 'when', 'things', 'got', 'little', 'too', 'weird', 'aside', 'thought', 'two', 'actors', 'had', 'good', 'chemistry', 'even', 'times', 'seemed', 'tense', 'apparent', 'reason', 'storyline', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'tweaking', 'brushing']",Vacationland
1018488,AFZU6XDO5L75R,B000I2J5TW,"Darien Wells ""darien""","[3, 4]","As the story unfolds, Joe is a teenager to whom many unpleasant things have happened in life. All in all he has accepted himself for the way he is but is searching for a better existence and something with real meaning. He plays the game of fitting in with his peers, but Joe is and has long been in love with his best friend Andrew who has yet to discover exactly who and what he is. Andrew is also playing the game, but is deeply attracted to Joe underneath it all and there is a strong bond between them. The film seems to be more about overcoming the struggles of the past, dealing with the present and trying to figure out a way to find true happiness that just doesn't seem to be a part of every day life. This scope would have made a perfect film had the story been written better and put together in some way that made a whole lot more sense.The film falls way short of it's potential and leaves the viewer feeling rather empty and unsatisfied. With some after thought a few of the pieces begin to make more sense, but overall a bit disappointing. One major drawback for this project is the sound quality which is horrible! I found the two lead actors; Brad Hallowell as Joe, and Gregory J. Lucas as Andrew (who bears a striking resemblence to Englands Prince William) to be quite attractive and felt they played their parts extremely well. The passion between them seemed genuine and very well portrayed. About all of the other actors in this film were not very good with their roles, seemed to lack acting ability and came across quite poorly cast. In fact I would have liked to seen most of the other characters deleted completely from the script, and seen more emphasis on the leading characters. Another factor I found a bit unbelievable were the ages of these two guys playing the part of 18 year olds. They are a bit older than that, and it shows. It might have worked better with the same fellows but as college students or perhaps even different actors although they were quite good conveying their characters otherwise. There were a whole lot of flaws to endure and the film is rather dark with a lot of unexplained happenings that make little if any sense.  The DVD contains a few deleted scenes, at least one of which could have worked well in the film with a little work, however the whole thing is 104 minutes without the additional scenes. Nothing else to offer but the theatrical Trailer. All in all, I really, truly like this film, but it fell so flat from it's potential. It's a shame it couldn't have been done with more professionalism, a well written script, better actors in at least most of the roles, and a whole lot better editing and sound. I have no clue as to why the title ""vacationland"". There's absolutely nothing in this film to explain that. I like it well enough to give it 3 stars but I'm so disppointed that it fell short of what it could have been.",3,"""For Joe"".",1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,2893,"['story', 'unfolds', 'Joe', 'teenager', 'whom', 'many', 'unpleasant', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'life', 'accepted', 'way', 'searching', 'better', 'existence', 'something', 'real', 'meaning', 'game', 'fitting', 'peers', 'Joe', 'long', 'been', 'love', 'best', 'friend', 'Andrew', 'who', 'yet', 'discover', 'exactly', 'who', 'what', 'Andrew', 'also', 'playing', 'game', 'deeply', 'attracted', 'Joe', 'strong', 'bond', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'overcoming', 'struggles', 'past', 'dealing', 'present', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'find', 'true', 'happiness', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'part', 'day', 'life', 'scope', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'perfect', 'film', 'had', 'story', 'been', 'written', 'better', 'put', 'together', 'way', 'made', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'sense.The', 'film', 'way', 'short', 'potential', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'rather', 'empty', 'unsatisfied', 'thought', 'few', 'pieces', 'begin', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'overall', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'One', 'major', 'drawback', 'project', 'sound', 'quality', 'horrible', 'found', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'Brad', 'Hallowell', 'Joe', 'Gregory', 'J.', 'Lucas', 'Andrew', 'who', 'striking', 'resemblence', 'Englands', 'Prince', 'William', 'be', 'quite', 'attractive', 'felt', 'played', 'parts', 'extremely', 'well', 'passion', 'seemed', 'genuine', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'seemed', 'lack', 'acting', 'ability', 'came', 'quite', 'poorly', 'cast', 'fact', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'seen', 'most', 'other', 'characters', 'deleted', 'completely', 'script', 'seen', 'more', 'emphasis', 'leading', 'characters', 'factor', 'found', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'were', 'ages', 'two', 'guys', 'playing', 'part', '18', 'year', 'olds', 'are', 'bit', 'older', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'same', 'fellows', 'college', 'students', 'perhaps', 'even', 'different', 'actors', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'conveying', 'characters', 'otherwise', 'were', 'whole', 'lot', 'flaws', 'endure', 'film', 'rather', 'dark', 'lot', 'unexplained', 'happenings', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'DVD', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'least', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'well', 'film', 'little', 'work', 'however', 'whole', 'thing', '104', 'minutes', 'additional', 'scenes', 'Nothing', 'else', 'offer', 'theatrical', 'Trailer', 'really', 'truly', 'film', 'fell', 'so', 'flat', 'potential', 'shame', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'done', 'more', 'professionalism', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'better', 'actors', 'least', 'most', 'roles', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'editing', 'sound', 'have', 'clue', 'why', 'title', 'vacationland', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', 'explain', 'well', 'enough', 'give', '3', 'stars', ""'m"", 'so', 'disppointed', 'fell', 'short', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been']",Vacationland
