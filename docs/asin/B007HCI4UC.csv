1530751,A2C441KW9Y7UNS,B007HCI4UC,Gary A. Smith,"[0, 0]",This AIP comedy has got to be one of the silliest they ever produced but it is endearing nevertheless and lots of fun. It also has some nice original songs. The quality of the MGM MOD DVD is a stunning 2.35 Panavision image with great color. It actually looksremastered. There are certainly worse ways to spend 90 minutes.,4,Silly?

1530754,A107H3XGCV6Y4Q,B007HCI4UC,"Paige Turner ""Film Fanatic""","[0, 0]","This is one of Frankie's lesser known films in that he is not paired with Annette Funicello. Still, it is very cute and funny. It features some big-name stars like Deborah Walley, Eve Arden, Cesar Romero, Gale Gordon of &#34;Lucy&#34; fame, Harvey Lembeck and a lot of the &#34;Beach Party&#34; gang from Annette and Frankie's films. The plot is basic: Sergeant Deadhead is a sweet, somewhat naive, bumbling fool in the Air Force who accidentally ends up in a rocket with a chimp. After they orbit into space and return, Deadhead is hailed a National hero and is transformed into a big-headed egotistical jerk who thinks he can order the officers around. The military, seeing that Deadhead's massive ego is bad for their image, manage to find a lookalike. Walley as Airman Lucy Turner is desperately trying to wed Deadhead, but the wedding keeps getting delayed until she's fooled by the top brass to marry the lookalike. Of course there's a case of mixed identities between Deadhead and the lookalike, but it's all in fun. Interestingly, AIP (American International Pictures) decided to make this film in hopes that a military comedy would prove as popular as the beach party comedies. Unfortunately, it bombed at the box office. There was supposed to be a second Deadhead comedy called &#34;Sergeant Deadhead Goes to Mars&#34; but because this movie failed, it was never made. I like this film because there's music, just like the beach party films, plus you get to see all the popular Beach Party actors such as Donna Loren, Buster Keaton and Harvey Lembeck. There's a clever musical sequence where the women airmen all sing in their bunks, using flashlights to illuminate their faces as they sing their solos. Donna Loren, of course, leads this sequence with her beautiful voice, but surprisingly some of the other Beach Party regulars can also sing. If you don't mind Annette's absence, this film is a delightful family comedy, goofy fun just like the Beach Party movies. Of course, it would have wonderful if she was in this movie, but Annette was married and pregnant with her first daughter Gina by the time this movie was made. An enjoyable romp!",5,Goofy fun comedy with big name stars,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,2155,"['one', 'Frankie', 'lesser', 'known', 'films', 'not', 'paired', 'Annette', 'Funicello', 'Still', 'very', 'cute', 'funny', 'big-name', 'stars', 'Deborah', 'Walley', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'Gale', 'Gordon', '34', 'Lucy', '34', 'fame', 'Harvey', 'Lembeck', 'lot', '34', 'Beach', 'Party', '34', 'gang', 'Annette', 'Frankie', 'films', 'plot', 'basic', 'Sergeant', 'Deadhead', 'sweet', 'somewhat', 'naive', 'bumbling', 'fool', 'Air', 'Force', 'who', 'accidentally', 'up', 'rocket', 'chimp', 'orbit', 'space', 'return', 'Deadhead', 'hailed', 'National', 'hero', 'transformed', 'big-headed', 'egotistical', 'jerk', 'who', 'can', 'order', 'officers', 'military', 'seeing', 'Deadhead', 'massive', 'ego', 'bad', 'image', 'manage', 'find', 'lookalike', 'Walley', 'Airman', 'Lucy', 'Turner', 'desperately', 'trying', 'wed', 'Deadhead', 'wedding', 'getting', 'delayed', 'fooled', 'top', 'brass', 'marry', 'lookalike', 'course', 'case', 'mixed', 'identities', 'Deadhead', 'lookalike', 'fun', 'Interestingly', 'AIP', 'American', 'International', 'Pictures', 'decided', 'make', 'film', 'hopes', 'military', 'comedy', 'would', 'prove', 'as', 'popular', 'beach', 'party', 'comedies', 'Unfortunately', 'bombed', 'box', 'office', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'second', 'Deadhead', 'comedy', 'called', '34', 'Sergeant', 'Deadhead', 'Goes', 'Mars', '34', 'movie', 'failed', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'film', 'music', 'just', 'beach', 'party', 'films', 'get', 'see', 'popular', 'Beach', 'Party', 'actors', 'such', 'Donna', 'Loren', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'Harvey', 'Lembeck', 'clever', 'musical', 'sequence', 'where', 'women', 'airmen', 'sing', 'bunks', 'using', 'flashlights', 'illuminate', 'sing', 'solos', 'Donna', 'Loren', 'course', 'sequence', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'surprisingly', 'other', 'Beach', 'Party', 'regulars', 'can', 'also', 'sing', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Annette', 'absence', 'film', 'delightful', 'family', 'comedy', 'goofy', 'fun', 'just', 'Beach', 'Party', 'movies', 'course', 'would', 'have', 'wonderful', 'was', 'movie', 'Annette', 'was', 'married', 'pregnant', 'first', 'daughter', 'Gina', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'enjoyable', 'romp']",Sergeant Deadhead
