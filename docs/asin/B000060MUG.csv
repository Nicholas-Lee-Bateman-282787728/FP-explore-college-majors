I love reggae and dancehall music but the music on the DVD was not great and it was a bunch of people girating with little instruction.,1,Disappointed...,1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,232,"['What', 'disappointment', 'DVD', 'was', 'wish', 'could', 'return', 'did', 'not', 'learn', 'dance', 'moves', 'love', 'reggae', 'dancehall', 'music', 'music', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'was', 'bunch', 'people', 'girating', 'little', 'instruction']",N/A

I love the warm-up & the dances in the different sections; my favorite move is the fly away.  Michelle is so ""perky"" that you can do this workout at 5am & still start smiling because of her cheerfulness; there's even a part where she forgot what step she was supposed to be doing & she just played it off, smiled, & kept it movin'!  I love the cooldown...everything about this workout just worked for me. I still have the bonus cd with the music.  I'm surprised that I still have that copy because I've just about wore that baby out!",5,Great workout!,1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,614,"['first', 'ordered', 'workout', 'BET', 'advertisement', 'am', 'reggae', 'fan', 'love', 'warm-up', 'dances', 'different', 'sections', 'favorite', 'move', 'fly', 'away', 'Michelle', 'so', 'perky', 'can', 'do', 'workout', '5am', 'still', 'start', 'smiling', 'cheerfulness', 'even', 'part', 'where', 'forgot', 'what', 'step', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'just', 'played', 'off', 'smiled', 'kept', 'love', 'cooldown', 'everything', 'workout', 'just', 'worked', 'still', 'have', 'bonus', 'cd', 'music', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'still', 'have', 'copy', ""'ve"", 'just', 'wore', 'out']",N/A

A lot of times the dance videos seem to operate under the assumption that the dances have to have you spinning in circles in order to work.  Wrong.  What I love about this DVD is that the routines are really easy, but keep your heart rate up.  It really does make you sweat!",5,uncomplicated and effective,1116201600,"05 16, 2005",2005,348,"['really', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'fun', 'simple', 'very', 'effective', 'lot', 'times', 'dance', 'videos', 'seem', 'operate', 'assumption', 'dances', 'have', 'have', 'spinning', 'circles', 'order', 'work', 'Wrong', 'What', 'love', 'DVD', 'routines', 'are', 'really', 'easy', 'keep', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'really', 'make', 'sweat']",N/A
691204,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B000060MUG,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[16, 18]","This workout is great, the dancers are very talented, love dancing & very fluid & really show you hot to get into the beat/music. That alone is better then most dance workouts by people who have no rhythm, *cough* Kathy Smith *cough*. When you learn to dance from people who can't feel a rhythm & are very stiff with bad posture/form, your form looks bad as well.I never was into reggae music before, but I loved dancing to these songs & was really able to feel the beat/rhythm for the second time in my life. Zumba latin dancing DVDs, which Amazon doesn't carry, is the other.It's set on a beach with Vanessa two other women & one very buff guy (the people you see on the cover) who you can tell have many years of dance experience between them. The music is always playing that really gets you going.The warmup includes nice upward stretches, back openings & the usual calf & hampstring stretches & butterly.There are three routines, the 2nd one taught by the guy. They teach by going 1/2 speed (not 1/4 like other DVDs that let you get bored)& breakdown the steps one-by-one & slowly put it together while the music is always playing to keep you inspired.In between learning new steps, I love they don't stop, they have you do an easy dance step as an ""ISLAND BREAK!"" often to keep you going w/o killing you. Because, trust me, you will get hot with the whole 40+ min workout. If you're in great shape, you can use the time to do the harder steps to the music to increase your heartrate.The cooldown is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen, it should be done on a stage. It's done poolside & the music is very slow & sensual. There isn't any cuing, but they move so slow, if you watch it 1-2x you'll have it down pat easy. When you do it, you feel so graceful & the moves are perfect to stretch out the exact muscles that need it & feel so good.The only negative is in between each segment (about 5), Miss Jamaica talks from another location for about 30 seconds to 1 min, but I use that time to grab water or FF the DVD.There's a trailer at collagevideo com",5,Great Energy/Fun,1071964800,"12 21, 2003",2003,2065,"['workout', 'great', 'dancers', 'are', 'very', 'talented', 'love', 'dancing', 'very', 'fluid', 'really', 'show', 'hot', 'get', 'beat/music', 'alone', 'better', 'then', 'most', 'dance', 'workouts', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'rhythm', '*cough*', 'Kathy', 'Smith', '*cough*', 'When', 'learn', 'dance', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'rhythm', 'are', 'very', 'stiff', 'bad', 'posture/form', 'form', 'bad', 'well.I', 'never', 'was', 'reggae', 'music', 'loved', 'dancing', 'songs', 'was', 'really', 'able', 'feel', 'beat/rhythm', 'second', 'time', 'life', 'Zumba', 'latin', 'dancing', 'DVDs', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'carry', 'other.It', 'set', 'beach', 'Vanessa', 'two', 'other', 'women', 'one', 'very', 'buff', 'guy', 'people', 'see', 'cover', 'who', 'can', 'tell', 'have', 'many', 'years', 'dance', 'experience', 'music', 'always', 'playing', 'really', 'going.The', 'warmup', 'nice', 'upward', 'stretches', 'back', 'usual', 'calf', 'hampstring', 'stretches', 'are', 'three', 'routines', '2nd', 'one', 'taught', 'guy', 'teach', 'going', '1/2', 'speed', 'not', '1/4', 'other', 'DVDs', 'let', 'get', 'bored', 'steps', 'one-by-one', 'slowly', 'put', 'together', 'music', 'always', 'playing', 'keep', 'inspired.In', 'learning', 'new', 'steps', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'have', 'do', 'easy', 'dance', 'step', 'ISLAND', 'BREAK', 'often', 'keep', 'going', 'w/o', 'killing', 'trust', 'will', 'get', 'hot', 'whole', '40+', 'min', 'workout', ""'re"", 'great', 'shape', 'can', 'use', 'time', 'do', 'harder', 'steps', 'music', 'increase', 'heartrate.The', 'cooldown', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'stage', 'done', 'poolside', 'music', 'very', 'slow', 'sensual', ""n't"", 'cuing', 'move', 'so', 'slow', 'watch', '1-2x', ""'ll"", 'have', 'down', 'pat', 'easy', 'When', 'do', 'feel', 'so', 'graceful', 'moves', 'are', 'perfect', 'stretch', 'out', 'exact', 'muscles', 'need', 'feel', 'so', 'good.The', 'only', 'negative', 'segment', '5', 'Miss', 'Jamaica', 'talks', 'location', '30', 'seconds', '1', 'min', 'use', 'time', 'grab', 'water', 'FF', 'DVD.There', 'trailer', 'collagevideo', 'com']",N/A
