In short, a $ poor college girl takes a babysitting job to buy a bed for her dorm, only to find the job entails far more than babysitting. The story spends little time on background and within 15 minutes introduces horror elements that keep you engaged almost immediately, and does not really slow down at all until the end. Nearly no wasted scenes at all, they all fit together well in a cohesive whole. Despite comments about this being a low budget film, it didn't feel that way at all, except for:  (1) not amazing picture quality (definitely not hollywood blockbuster-level video quality), and (2) the lack of recognizable actors (except for the guy from House of 1000 Corpses). Otherwise, this felt like a fully mainstream movie, and some of the video grit probably contributed to production values. Further, the story was great. The cover essentially tells you there is a twist, and its a good one, although there are aspects fairly easy to predict (but that doesn't necessarily detract too much from the fun of the twist). I will say, however, the cover sells it as a darkly humorous horror; while there were a few slightly comedic elements, I do not agree with that characterization. Not that it detracts from the movie at all, but just don't expect that type of film.

What starts as a quiet evening turns into the night from hell when she begins receiving suspicious phone calls from a mysterious stalker. BABYSITTER WANTED is a strong independent Slasher film that suffers tremendously from having been released in the same year as HOUSE OF THE DEVIL, considering that they are nearly shot-for-shot the exact same film. From the basic plotting and devilish twist to the vintage 80's aesthetic, it is frightening how similar the two truly are. Despite the fact, BABYSITTER WANTED shares many of the same strengths as Ti West's film. Jonas Barnes and Michael Manasseri have successfully created a spooky atmosphere and oppressive mood that builds up to what eventually becomes a brutal and graphic Slasher. The babysitting theme calls back to other genre classics like BLACK CHRISTMAS or WHEN A STRANGER CALLS, where common household noises and the fear of being alone tap into universal terrors the audience can relate to. Just past the half-way point, the entire direction of the film shifts, and girls are found hung, gutted, and dismembered as Angie struggles to survive. Sarah Thompson is excellent in the role of the sweet and unassuming girl next door, and brings a sincerity and authenticity to her performance. If BABYSITTER WANTED had only been released a year earlier, it may have had a much larger impact on Horror audiences, but that should not keep anyone from picking up this dark and mean-spirited film.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,Babysitter Wanted,1283385600,"09 2, 2010",2010,1603,"['Angie', 'poor', 'college', 'student', 'babysitting', 'gig', 'remote', 'farmhouse', 'order', 'pay', 'school', 'expenses', 'What', 'quiet', 'evening', 'night', 'hell', 'when', 'receiving', 'suspicious', 'phone', 'calls', 'mysterious', 'stalker', 'BABYSITTER', 'WANTED', 'strong', 'independent', 'Slasher', 'film', 'tremendously', 'having', 'been', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'HOUSE', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'considering', 'are', 'nearly', 'shot-for-shot', 'exact', 'same', 'film', 'basic', 'plotting', 'devilish', 'twist', 'vintage', '80', 'aesthetic', 'frightening', 'how', 'similar', 'two', 'truly', 'are', 'fact', 'BABYSITTER', 'WANTED', 'shares', 'many', 'same', 'strengths', 'Ti', 'West', 'film', 'Jonas', 'Barnes', 'Michael', 'Manasseri', 'have', 'successfully', 'created', 'spooky', 'atmosphere', 'oppressive', 'mood', 'up', 'what', 'eventually', 'brutal', 'graphic', 'Slasher', 'babysitting', 'theme', 'back', 'other', 'genre', 'classics', 'BLACK', 'CHRISTMAS', 'WHEN', 'A', 'STRANGER', 'CALLS', 'where', 'common', 'household', 'noises', 'fear', 'being', 'alone', 'tap', 'universal', 'terrors', 'audience', 'can', 'relate', 'Just', 'half-way', 'point', 'entire', 'direction', 'film', 'shifts', 'girls', 'are', 'found', 'hung', 'gutted', 'dismembered', 'Angie', 'survive', 'Sarah', 'Thompson', 'excellent', 'role', 'sweet', 'unassuming', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'sincerity', 'authenticity', 'performance', 'BABYSITTER', 'WANTED', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'released', 'year', 'earlier', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'larger', 'impact', 'Horror', 'audiences', 'should', 'not', 'keep', 'anyone', 'picking', 'up', 'dark', 'mean-spirited', 'film.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

So how do you keep things moving forward and fresh? Check this puppy out and you might have your answer.A very religious girl leaves home for college and picks up a babysitter job for some extra cash. She's a bit skittish to begin with and when things start to go south, and they do go way south, during her first night with the kid, she can barely hold on. Fear not though viewer, she manages to muster up some guts and see things through to the end.Early on in the film I wasn't that impressed. Not much new was happening and they had something going that was way too obvious (or so I thought). So when the worm turned (and I won't spoil things) it really caught my interest and got me going.The acting was decent pretty much all the way around. There is a scene between the dad and the babysitter that is worth the price of admission all by itself. The production values were good enough to not let the bones show, and the storyline was genuinely decent. There was some cheapness in the proceedings such as when the babysitter scrambles for a weapon while being pulled back by her attacker. We've seen that way too many times in movies. And the music score was genuinely terrible. But overall this is a worthwhile watch.

Because it tries to draw its paper-thin plot out to feature length, huge flaws in the script quickly jump out at you, as opposed to all of the other, scarier things that are supposed to jump out at you during a horror film.Angie, a devout Catholic girl, travels far from home to attend a community college where she plans to major in art history. Just let that sink in for a bit. Although this community college has dorms (???) she is staying with an immediately hateful roommate who has managed to let Angie's bed slip through her fingers. To find the cash to support herself and get a new bed, Angie decides to babysit a quiet boy who lives with his rustic mom and dad way out in the bluffs. Then things get spooky!Ha ha. No, they don't. There are a few well done moments at the start of the film, including a quick false scare in an art class, but the script is too threadbare to really hold too much suspense or interest. First of all, the characters are so stereotypical that they come across as bored of themselves. You have the world's worst acted pot head, the dashing love interest with no personality traits other than a sudden and inexplicable willingness to be The Perfect Guy, and a clueless cop or two.And, of course, there's Angie, perhaps one of the most boring characters I've ever encountered in film. Her major character traits include being frightened by everything and talking to herself with some of the most wooden dialogue I've seen outside of a community college video brochure. &#34;Maybe watching some TV will help me relax,&#34; she says at one point to no one at all. Oh, brother. Then she turns on the TV and it's too loud! &#34;You shouldn't leave your TV on so loud if you don't want to wake people up,&#34; she says as she lowers the volume. Now THAT'S dialogue!Anyway, when Angie's lines DO get a little spunky, they are equally cheesy, just in the opposite direction. Obviously, her babysitting gig goes wrong in a few ways, and she gets the chance to scream and run and fall down for no reason and kick and claw and slash with a few choice tidbits like &#34;Suck it!&#34; or something like that. But it's still pretty humdrum stuff. A lot of this is because for the first fifty minutes, the movie uses the &#34;slow pan with loud rising violin sound like something exciting is going to happen AND IT'S A ... [insert nonscary thing here]&#34; trick once every two minutes. Scary movies have to create atmosphere, but this editing trick is like the iron lung of horror movie tropes, and it gets really old, really fast. At one point, alone in the kitchen, Angie reaches for the cupboard. We see her hand move slowly, the tense trill of the music rises in volume, she opens the cupboard, the music HITS A CRESCENDO AND -- DEAR GOD WHAT IS IT? -- there are cups there. That's it.The only character or moment to have any kind of spark is the boy's father, who is trying to hard to channel Bruce Campbell that it's almost admirable. However, his character and his moments to shine -- as well done as they are -- feel really out of place in the banal and rather predictable rest of the film. As dull as its leading lady, the movie would've had a lot more spark had it been released as a short film with all of its bloated musical scares and cheesy character development sliced away leaving nothing but the raw meat of it behind.",1,Overcooked,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",2014,3484,"['movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'lot', 'better', 'thirty', 'minute', 'episode', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'other', 'scary', 'show', 'anthology', 'draw', 'paper-thin', 'plot', 'feature', 'length', 'huge', 'flaws', 'script', 'quickly', 'jump', 'out', 'opposed', 'other', 'scarier', 'things', 'are', 'supposed', 'jump', 'out', 'horror', 'film.Angie', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'girl', 'travels', 'far', 'home', 'attend', 'community', 'college', 'where', 'major', 'art', 'history', 'Just', 'let', 'sink', 'bit', 'community', 'college', 'dorms', 'staying', 'immediately', 'hateful', 'roommate', 'who', 'managed', 'let', 'Angie', 'bed', 'slip', 'fingers', 'find', 'cash', 'support', 'get', 'new', 'bed', 'Angie', 'babysit', 'quiet', 'boy', 'who', 'rustic', 'mom', 'dad', 'way', 'bluffs', 'Then', 'things', 'get', 'spooky', 'Ha', 'ha', 'No', 'do', ""n't"", 'are', 'few', 'well', 'done', 'moments', 'start', 'film', 'including', 'quick', 'false', 'scare', 'art', 'class', 'script', 'too', 'threadbare', 'really', 'hold', 'too', 'much', 'suspense', 'interest', 'First', 'all', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'stereotypical', 'come', 'bored', 'have', 'world', 'worst', 'acted', 'pot', 'head', 'dashing', 'love', 'interest', 'personality', 'other', 'sudden', 'inexplicable', 'willingness', 'be', 'Perfect', 'Guy', 'clueless', 'cop', 'two.And', 'course', 'Angie', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'film', 'major', 'character', 'traits', 'include', 'being', 'frightened', 'everything', 'talking', 'herself', 'most', 'wooden', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'community', 'college', 'video', 'brochure', '34', 'Maybe', 'watching', 'TV', 'will', 'help', 'relax', '34', 'one', 'point', 'one', 'Oh', 'brother', 'Then', 'TV', 'too', 'loud', '34', 'should', ""n't"", 'leave', 'TV', 'loud', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'wake', 'people', 'up', '34', 'volume', 'Now', 'THAT', 'dialogue', 'Anyway', 'when', 'Angie', 'lines', 'DO', 'get', 'little', 'spunky', 'are', 'equally', 'cheesy', 'just', 'opposite', 'direction', 'Obviously', 'babysitting', 'gig', 'wrong', 'few', 'ways', 'chance', 'scream', 'run', 'fall', 'down', 'reason', 'kick', 'claw', 'slash', 'few', 'choice', 'tidbits', '34', 'Suck', '34', 'something', 'still', 'pretty', 'humdrum', 'stuff', 'lot', 'first', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'movie', '34', 'slow', 'pan', 'loud', 'rising', 'violin', 'sound', 'something', 'exciting', 'going', 'happen', 'AND', 'IT', 'A', '[', 'insert', 'nonscary', 'thing', 'here', ']', '34', 'trick', 'once', 'two', 'minutes', 'Scary', 'movies', 'have', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'editing', 'trick', 'iron', 'lung', 'horror', 'movie', 'tropes', 'really', 'old', 'really', 'fast', 'one', 'point', 'alone', 'kitchen', 'Angie', 'cupboard', 'see', 'hand', 'move', 'slowly', 'tense', 'trill', 'music', 'volume', 'cupboard', 'music', 'A', 'CRESCENDO', 'AND', 'DEAR', 'GOD', 'WHAT', 'IT', 'are', 'cups', 'there', 'it.The', 'only', 'character', 'moment', 'have', 'kind', 'spark', 'boy', 'father', 'who', 'trying', 'hard', 'channel', 'Bruce', 'Campbell', 'almost', 'admirable', 'However', 'character', 'moments', 'shine', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'feel', 'really', 'place', 'banal', 'rather', 'predictable', 'rest', 'film', 'As', 'dull', 'leading', 'lady', 'movie', 'would', ""'ve"", 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'spark', 'had', 'been', 'released', 'short', 'film', 'bloated', 'musical', 'scares', 'cheesy', 'character', 'development', 'sliced', 'away', 'leaving', 'nothing', 'raw', 'meat']",N/A

Schultz,"[43, 53]","If you like sensing a stalker, there is some suspense for you at the beginning of this movie as an innocent young college student finds herself in some increasingly ominous surroundings. If you like raw slasher action, you'll get plenty of that as the movie devolves into being a real cut-up. I'm not sure that the turn the plot takes validates all the carnage. It is so misogynistic and brutal in parts, that a viewer can only maintain a charitable view of human nature by taking the imaginings projected on screen here as being campy.However, you might find the most interesting part of this DVD to be the commentary. This bonus feature is hidden among the ""Set-Up"" options. It's worth checking out for a variety of reasons. The film's directors and its star kick back in an air of jocular, slightly intoxicated ease, and offer their views on the movie's action and on life in general.Listening to this commentary is like being invited to a college frat party. But it also can painlessly provide an interesting sociological study. It's a good example of how men and women view violence against women differently. While still keeping in the easy-going spirit of the gathering, Sarah Thompson reminds the directors how she had stipulated that she would star in this film only on condition that it would not include any blatantly exploitative shots of women being mutilated. She chided the men about clearly NOT having lived up to their promises in that regard. She also mentions that members of PETA would probably appreciate this film because it shows the horror of what it's like to be butchered. Directors Manasseri and Barnes don't quite seem to get Thompson's point on this score.The men did think Thompson was being contradictory when, on the one hand, she objected to the graphic violence against women, but on the other hand, thought there was too LITTLE nudity in the film. Thompson kept correcting that she just thought it was illogical that a woman would be allowed to retain her underwear while being sawed up. While that expedient might have been necessary in order for the film to avoid dropping from an ""R"" rating all the way down to the restrictive NC-17 rating - the men still thought Thompson was advocating for more nudity rather than simply pointing out a logical inconsistency.So the commentary provides a lively jousting between young men and women, an insight into the kinds of misunderstandings and conflicting sensibilities that exist between men and women - before the final cut.",3,"Not Exactly Prime Cut, But Interesting for Other Reasons",1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,2505,"['like', 'sensing', 'stalker', 'suspense', 'beginning', 'movie', 'innocent', 'young', 'college', 'student', 'increasingly', 'ominous', 'surroundings', 'like', 'raw', 'slasher', 'action', ""'ll"", 'get', 'plenty', 'movie', 'being', 'real', 'cut-up', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'turn', 'plot', 'validates', 'carnage', 'so', 'misogynistic', 'brutal', 'parts', 'viewer', 'can', 'only', 'maintain', 'charitable', 'view', 'human', 'nature', 'taking', 'imaginings', 'projected', 'screen', 'here', 'being', 'campy.However', 'might', 'find', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'DVD', 'be', 'commentary', 'bonus', 'feature', 'hidden', 'Set-Up', 'options', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'variety', 'reasons', 'film', 'directors', 'star', 'kick', 'back', 'air', 'jocular', 'slightly', 'intoxicated', 'ease', 'offer', 'views', 'movie', 'action', 'life', 'general.Listening', 'commentary', 'being', 'invited', 'college', 'frat', 'party', 'also', 'can', 'painlessly', 'provide', 'interesting', 'sociological', 'study', 'good', 'example', 'how', 'men', 'women', 'view', 'violence', 'women', 'differently', 'still', 'keeping', 'easy-going', 'spirit', 'gathering', 'Sarah', 'Thompson', 'directors', 'how', 'had', 'stipulated', 'would', 'star', 'film', 'only', 'condition', 'would', 'not', 'include', 'blatantly', 'exploitative', 'shots', 'women', 'being', 'mutilated', 'chided', 'men', 'clearly', 'NOT', 'having', 'lived', 'up', 'promises', 'regard', 'also', 'members', 'PETA', 'would', 'probably', 'appreciate', 'film', 'horror', 'what', 'be', 'butchered', 'Directors', 'Manasseri', 'Barnes', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'seem', 'get', 'Thompson', 'point', 'score.The', 'men', 'did', 'think', 'Thompson', 'was', 'being', 'contradictory', 'when', 'one', 'hand', 'objected', 'graphic', 'violence', 'women', 'other', 'hand', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'LITTLE', 'nudity', 'film', 'Thompson', 'kept', 'correcting', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'illogical', 'woman', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'retain', 'underwear', 'being', 'sawed', 'up', 'expedient', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'necessary', 'order', 'film', 'avoid', 'dropping', 'R', 'rating', 'way', 'restrictive', 'NC-17', 'rating', 'men', 'still', 'thought', 'Thompson', 'was', 'advocating', 'more', 'nudity', 'rather', 'simply', 'pointing', 'out', 'logical', 'inconsistency.So', 'commentary', 'lively', 'jousting', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'insight', 'kinds', 'misunderstandings', 'conflicting', 'sensibilities', 'exist', 'men', 'women', 'final', 'cut']",N/A

After meeting with Jim (Bruce Thomas) and Violet Stanton (Kristen Dalton) on their farm, Angie is hired to watch over their young son Sam (Kai Caster).  On the designated night, Angie's friend Rick (Matt Dallas) drops her off at the farm and, she and Sam settle in for a quiet evening.  Unfortunately the peace is broken by a series of strange phone calls, and then a man breaks into the house with murderous intent.Babysitter Wanted features a shift in direction that's slightly out of left field, but things quickly refocus, and the story then follows a pretty conventional path, heavy on the black humor, and with a decent amount of gore, as the Stanton's do their utmost to be good parents to their son.  There are some issues with what happens, particularly regarding an overzealous clergyman, but the film still manages to hold together fairly well.  The acting performances are pretty solid, with Bruce Thomas leading the way, and Kai Caster making a pretty creepy little kid.The film isn't particularly impressive looking on Bluray, and the bonus features consist mostly of a couple of short bonus featurettes including cast interviews, and trailers, so the single disc DVD version may suffice for most.",4,loving parents attend to their son's needs...,1355702400,"12 17, 2012",2012,1657,"['Babysitter', 'Wanted', '2008', 'effectively', 'chilling', 'tale', 'horror', 'along', 'nice', 'clip', 'providing', 'few', 'surprises', 'way', 'heading', 'down', 'familiar', 'path', 'finish', 'student', 'Angie', 'Albright', 'Sarah', 'Thompson', 'community', 'college', 'study', 'art', 'up', 'battling', 'life.A', 'religious', 'person', 'Angie', 'troubled', 'young', 'women', 'area', 'have', 'disappeared', 'someone', 'be', 'following', 'meeting', 'Jim', 'Bruce', 'Thomas', 'Violet', 'Stanton', 'Kristen', 'Dalton', 'farm', 'Angie', 'hired', 'watch', 'over', 'young', 'son', 'Sam', 'Kai', 'Caster', 'designated', 'night', 'Angie', 'friend', 'Rick', 'Matt', 'Dallas', 'off', 'farm', 'Sam', 'settle', 'quiet', 'evening', 'Unfortunately', 'peace', 'broken', 'series', 'strange', 'phone', 'calls', 'then', 'man', 'house', 'murderous', 'intent.Babysitter', 'Wanted', 'features', 'shift', 'direction', 'slightly', 'left', 'field', 'things', 'quickly', 'refocus', 'story', 'then', 'pretty', 'conventional', 'path', 'heavy', 'black', 'humor', 'decent', 'amount', 'gore', 'Stanton', 'do', 'utmost', 'be', 'good', 'parents', 'son', 'are', 'issues', 'what', 'particularly', 'regarding', 'overzealous', 'clergyman', 'film', 'still', 'hold', 'together', 'fairly', 'well', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'pretty', 'solid', 'Bruce', 'Thomas', 'leading', 'way', 'Kai', 'Caster', 'making', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'little', 'kid.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'impressive', 'looking', 'Bluray', 'bonus', 'features', 'consist', 'mostly', 'couple', 'short', 'bonus', 'featurettes', 'including', 'cast', 'interviews', 'trailers', 'single', 'disc', 'DVD', 'version', 'may', 'suffice', 'most']",N/A
