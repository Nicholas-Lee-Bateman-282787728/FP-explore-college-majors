1128273,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B0010YVCB6,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[0, 2]","Director Tony Giglio says, in the 'Making Of' Special Feature for ""Chaos"", that he wanted to recapture the spirit and gritty, pre-CGI 'look' of the great 'Cop' movies of the 1970s (""The French Connection"", ""The Seven-Ups"", etc.), and technically, he succeeds, quite admirably...but the film lacks equally important factors to the earlier films' success; characters you care about, and a truly novel 'spin' to the traditional plotline. ""Chaos"" is predictable, with little character development, relying on the stars' established screen personas to carry the story, and the end result is routine, at best.When a team of masked criminals rob a major Seattle bank, the leader (a swaggering Wesley Snipes) informs the police surrounding the bank that he wants disgraced cop Jason Statham to serve as the negotiator. Statham, who'd been involved in an earlier, fatal hostage negotiation, is pulled off suspension, teamed up with brilliant young detective Ryan Phillippe, and attempts to resolve the situation...but things fall apart, explosively, and the gang escapes in the fire and smoke. As the press again berates Statham, Phillippe begins putting the pieces together, revealing a far more complex scheme than a simple robbery...leading to a 'surprising' climactic revelation (which you'll figure out long before he does!)The film isn't terrible (there's one really good chase, early in the film), but as you've likely seen all this before, it isn't terribly involving, either. Phillippe takes the acting honors, Statham gets in a few good one-liners (but less of his 'signature' physical action than his fans may like), and Snipes mugs his way through another 'villainous' role.It should have been better!",3,Homage to 70s Cop Flicks Strictly Routine...,1255737600,"10 17, 2009",2009,1704,"['Director', 'Tony', 'Giglio', ""'Making"", 'Special', 'Feature', 'Chaos', 'wanted', 'recapture', 'spirit', 'gritty', 'pre-CGI', ""'look"", 'great', 'movies', '1970s', 'French', 'Connection', 'Seven-Ups', 'etc', 'technically', 'quite', 'admirably', 'film', 'equally', 'important', 'factors', 'earlier', 'films', 'success', 'characters', 'care', 'truly', 'novel', ""'spin"", 'traditional', 'plotline', 'Chaos', 'predictable', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'relying', 'stars', 'established', 'screen', 'personas', 'carry', 'story', 'end', 'result', 'routine', 'best.When', 'team', 'masked', 'criminals', 'rob', 'major', 'Seattle', 'bank', 'leader', 'swaggering', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'police', 'surrounding', 'bank', 'disgraced', 'cop', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'serve', 'negotiator', 'Statham', 'who', ""'d"", 'been', 'involved', 'earlier', 'fatal', 'hostage', 'negotiation', 'pulled', 'off', 'suspension', 'teamed', 'up', 'brilliant', 'young', 'detective', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'attempts', 'resolve', 'situation', 'things', 'fall', 'apart', 'explosively', 'gang', 'fire', 'smoke', 'press', 'again', 'Statham', 'Phillippe', 'putting', 'pieces', 'together', 'revealing', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'scheme', 'simple', 'robbery', 'leading', ""'surprising"", 'climactic', 'revelation', ""'ll"", 'figure', 'out', 'long', 'film', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'chase', 'early', 'film', ""'ve"", 'likely', 'seen', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'involving', 'either', 'Phillippe', 'acting', 'honors', 'Statham', 'few', 'good', 'one-liners', 'less', ""'signature"", 'physical', 'action', 'fans', 'may', 'like', 'Snipes', 'mugs', 'way', ""'villainous"", 'role.It', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better']",Chaos

I did not want to review that pack because the low score for this film would ruin the rating for that set!This film is clearly one of THE worst ever made and that I have ever seen!  I could write ten pages on how awful this was, but i'll do what I can.  The director, Ton Giglio, clearly does not know what he is doing. The timing is off; the editing is not really there; there is not really any music to keep you into it; the actors are THE worst and must be doing on the job training!  Many people hope to break into Hollywood and film in order to make an easy living, but some get the hook up and have no clue as to what to do!This film advertises Wesley Snipes, but he is in it for about four scenes!  He is in the opening scene, then you don't see him again for like 35 minutes, at which point when you do see him again, it is briefly and you forgot that he was in it!  Clearly they must have paid Snipes a decent amount just to do what little he did or he owed someone a favor!  They had the nerve to include a 'behind the scenes' featurette on this garbage!  That was more exciting that the film itself!  You know Snipes is a great actor as he tried to make it look like the film was good when it was horrible!Jason Statham was in it of course, and they never explain why an English guy made detective in the US.  He and Snipes were totally useless in this film as this movie had not smart plot and it tried to seem clever.  If it had better people working on it, maybe it could have been better.  It only had a $12M budget, so that could explain it, although I have seem better done for about the same.Only Snipes (whose acting was very far and above everyone else's) and Statham knew any kind of half-way believable acting, everyone else were people i have never seen before and these must have been their first roles or auditions - they were like C or D grade 'actors.'  I truly believe that I could have done better my first time out.  For example, one girl is being held hostage at gunpoint.  She shows ZERO emotion and almost looks as if she is waiting for the other actors to fish their lines before she makes her next move.  She did not look nor react like someone whose life was on the line!  She did act kind of hysterical - AFTER she was release!  The director could have corrected that - IF he were any good,The editing was horrible as well.  There was one what was supposed to have been a 'high-speed' chase, but it looked low-speed because the editing was not tight and the stunts look worse that what you see on old &#34;Hart to Hart&#34; episodes!  It is as if most involved were doing this for the first time!  Youtube amateurs do a much better job!Now for the Blu-Ray quality.  I do not think this is HD, I think this is a DVD print converted to BD.  The colors are washed out, there is no detail, the sound is not good and the shots of Seattle (clearly chosen because of budget) looked gloomy and noisy, but not detailed.  This is not archive quality and the picture quality adds to the disappointment.  Maybe it was filmed in digital?  Whichever the case, the quality is not good, so stay far away from this!

In writing and directing CHAOS, Tony Giglio (as he explains in one of the featurettes on the DVD) worked to make an action movie that was more than just pyrotechnics and killing (though those are in abundance in this film!), and instead return to the atmosphere of older 'French Connection' type crime dramas.  To accomplish this he uses the chaos theory to create just enough twists to keep the audience surprised.  If the film doesn't open new doors for the genre, it certainly supplies enough entertainment to make it worth watching.The film opens on a bridge in Seattle where an incident involving  detective Quentin Connors (Jason Statham) and another unidentified detective results in Connors being dismissed from the police force. A sophisticated bank heist ensues and the head of the heist is one Lorenz (Wesley Snipes) who, when surrounded by the police after an explosion jolts the neighborhood, demands to negotiate the hostages situation with Connors: Captain Jenkins (Henry Czerny) and a new police recruit Detective Shane Dekker (Ryan Phillippe) recruit the reluctant, fired Connors to return to Seattle to take charge - with Dekker as his partner.  From this point on the story is a m&eacute;lange of mind-bending assaults on the back using the chaos theory to trace the elements of discovery.  Just when the audience is comfortable with knowing the good guys from the bad guys, the chessboard turns and surprises occur that leave the story with a sense of incomplete thought on the part of the script, but also an appreciation for the degree of suspense the story has presented.The strong character in the film is Ryan Phillippe who is able to hold his own with the practiced action hero antics of Statham and Snipes.  There are some standout cameos, such as Keegan Connor Tracy who has one of the more sensually seductive roles on film, Henry Czerny as the forceful super chief, and Justine Waddell and Nicholas Lea as the detectives who shoulder the only truth in the tale. Not a great action movie but one with a modicum of intelligence that makes is rise above the many others in this category.

What could possibly go wrong with a movie featuring these three in a shifting triangle? You're expecting a ""no"" here, yes? Well, no, that's a no. For an action thriller/crime drama, it succeeds on all but one level.Snipes has little to do and plays mostly a walk-through role. That's a bit disappointing as I find him an excellent actor, but it's all part of the Big Picture of the theme of the story. Who is he? The answer depends on the which part of the story we're in. Does Snipes play a good guy or a villain?Ryan Philippe is such a pretty boy that I am always so surprised by the intensity and high level of consummate acting and moral center he brings to each role. That pouty bottom lip also serves him well. In this role he plays Jason Statham's young, new partner and son of a hero cop killed in action. He tells the Statham character, ""I didn't understand why they thought a cop killed on the job was a hero.""Philippe has a way of dissecting each scene and piece of evidence, much like a half-Aghan, half-pit bull would--elegant but determined. This is the third film I've seen him in and really like him as an actor.The story is a who done it, why, and how--much much typical EXCEPT for two things that simply astonished me and caused one more star than I would have given. Jason Statham, that English actor whose accent I barely comprehend at times, admonishes one character who uses a double negative. Wow! Then this actor who spends 97% of his time-on-screen in some wild action scene, has a book on Chaos theory in his book shelf (a book of intelligent gleanings). When Philippe pulls the book out of its slot, he reads some of the highlighted sections and discovers how these random scribblings were worked into the  crime drama of the day. So how is this book with these actions found in Statham's character's house? This is another part of that Big Picture. By the way, Statham plays a cop on penalty leave for an ""unnecessary"" killing.But where is Snipes? And who is he?AT last the viewer discovers the truth (mais non, I will not reveal it!) and it leaves the viewer oddly dissatisfied. This turn-about ending impacts the reader, leaving him disappointed and truly surprised.

In the DVD extras, he said he wanted to make a film that was like ""The French Connection,"" a homage to 70s action films that had great car chases, entertaining while made for a relatively low budget.  He accomplished his goal.  ""Chaos"" doesn't challenge you in any emotional way.  It's more of a mystery than an action film, trying to figure out who done it.Jason Statham is now a major action star.  I also watched him this weekend inRevolver.  This film won't make me forget ""The Transporter"" which I liked because of its blend of action and romance.  There really isn't that much romance going on in this film.  Statham is about like he is in the other films I've seen, always interesting, but not that different.Ryan Phillippe plays Detective Shane Dekker.  Phillippe was inBreach (Widescreen Edition), the Academy Award winningCrash (Widescreen Edition)&Gosford Park.  His intensity is impressive.  There's one scene where he listening to another person on the phone who gets important information.  He slams his hand down on the desk and yells, ""Yes!""  I thought, ""Now, that's over the top"" & rewound it, but he actually looks pretty good.  He appears pretty banged up and leaves blood on the side of his head between locations.  One imagines that they were short of towels and water in Seattle.Wesley Snipes won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for ""One Night Stand"" in 1997.  He does a good job in this picture, but most likely won't be picking up a statue.  I liked his wisecracking on the phone from the bank, only to hear the altered voice sound like a garbled monotone.  In the DVD extras, he said he didn't want his fight scenes to look like ""Blade.""  I think he did that.Henry Czerny fromThe Pink Panther (Special Edition)&The Ice Stormdoes a good job as the thickheaded Captain Martin Jenkins.  He's so incredibly shortsighted that one wonders how he got to be the leader.Justine Waddell who starred in TV's ""The Mystery of Natalie Wood"" plays Detective Teddy Balloway.  She's having an affair with the captain and used to sleep with Statham's Quentin Conner.  She's a pretty confused girl as far as relationships, and wouldn't you know that she didn't turn off her cell phone?!?Ty Olsson who I've been watching as Sam on TV's ""Men In Trees,"" plays the bad guy who winds up in the hospital.  He does a good job of being very different, making me stretch to connect him with television.  There's also a small part done well by the bank manager Rob LaBelle who has appeared in many television series like ""The 4400"" & ""The Dead Zone.""""Chaos"" is not the most original of films, nor does it intend to be.

The first song to pop up was ""Chaos"" by U.N.K.L.E. off of their album,Psyence Fiction.  No fooling.  Aside from the fact that it was an extraordinary coincidence, I also mention this because it was the most entertaining part of my movie-going experience, and it happened after the flick was over.The song is only okay, but it's certainly better than the film, a tepid ""action"" movie that claims to have a story built on the Chaos Theory once made so famous by Jeff Goldblum's character fromJurassic Park.  The idea is that chaos is never truly random, and that in even the most cluttered of incidents, patterns emerge.The theory is debatable, especially if this movie is meant to be one of its proponents.  After some exposition-heavy credits, several somber looking bank robbers (led by Wesley Snipes) take over a major branch of American Global in Seattle.  When hostage negotiations begin, the bad guys demand that disgraced officer Conners (Statham) be given the helm.  Unfortunately, as soon as he's put in charge, things go sideways.Aiding Conners is a newly appointed detective played by Ryan Phillipe, who refuses to act in every scene, relying almost exclusively on this pouty, petulant look he can do with his poofy lips.  Phillipe's character begins to steadily assemble the clues, sorting through the baffling array of red herrings to some supposed truth about chaos that the bad guys may or may not be trying to prove.  Scattered about the meandering script are a few lukewarm ""action"" sequences (including one of the dullest vehicle chases I've seen in a long while) and lots and lots of cringe-worthy dialogue.  In fact, when one of the officers announces that ""he wasn't just a better cop than you; he was also a better man,"" I suddenly realized I was watching a bad movie.In addition to all of this, there are stupid emotional back stories, unbelievable twists of misdirection, and even some insulting flashbacks as Phillipe puzzles it all out, in case the audience still doesn't get it.  Chaos, as a condition, can have its crafty corners and intriguing entanglements.  It can, in its own way, be beautiful.

The reason why some people may be irritated by this movie is because it is has people that are on the path of self-destruction.  They do not have a lot of consideration or respect for others; they think they are so smart, but are nothing more than moron punks and scumbags.  Their survival potential is bleak and their lives are spiraling out of control, even if they do not realize it.The movie is about three brothers and a sister.  The brothers include a would-be tough guy thug, a sleazy lawyer and an anarchist.  The anarchist and the sister (Maria Strzelecka) have a thing for each other that is more than just sibling affection.  Each of them is facing a problem of their own making.  A lot depends on how they deal with their issues, as there isn't much lower they can stoop other than being dead.  In the beginning of the film there is a lot going on, which makes it a little hard to follow, but that goes along with the theme of chaos.Even if you do not find any of the characters likeable and think they are all annoying, the story, albeit a modern, is a classical morality tale.  There are occasional comments about the world being in chaos, and from the perspective of the siblings it is sure looks like it, but in the end the movie shows otherwise.  It shows causes have effects and actions have reactions - those who commit destructive actions bring about destruction on themselves.  It may take karma a bit of time to correct things, but the order in the world finds its place eventually.Chaos is Xawery Zulawski's debut feature film.  Xawery is the son of Andrzej Zulawski, who is a brilliant director with a strong a cult following.  Although I do not want to make too many compairsons between the two, I have to say that Xawery's film is similar to his father's work in that it has an element of intenseness.

Spinning several plates in the air, the film requires that you pay close attention.A gang of criminals has taken hostages inside a bank.  Their leader Lorenz (Wesley Snipes), requests that suspended cop Quentin Conners (Jason Statham), be brought in to oversee the situation.  Conners agrees to take charge of the situation, and detective Shane Dekker (Ryan Phillippe), on his first day as a member of Seattle PD, is assigned as Conners' partner.  Already on the scene at the bank, are detectives Teddy Galloway (Justine Waddell), and Vincent Durano (Nicholas Lea).  Unfortunately things do not go as planned, and an explosion rocks the bank.  When the smoke clears, Lorenz and his gang are gone, but mysteriously, no cash or valuables seem to be missing.The investigative team gets a lead to one of the gang members, which turns up a load of cash.  The money is traced to the police evidence room, but the cop who was responsible for the cash, is soon found murdered.  Connors and Dekker, get a lead to another member of the gang, a computer specialist, but as they arrive on the scene, he is killed by Lorenz.  It continues to be a busy night, as the cops get a tip, and stake out a house where Lorenz is supposed to meet some of his buddies.  But things go very sour, as the house explodes with Connors inside.It has indeed been a very long first day for Shane Dekker, but he refuses to give up.  With the help of a police computer tech, he learns that over a billion dollars, has been stolen from the bank, via a computer virus.  He continues to unravel the mystery, discovering a lead to Lorenz's identity, and a tell-tale clue, points him to the truth.  As the new day breaks, Dekker has discovered the truth, and made sense from the chaos.Ryan Phillippe, is excellent and very believable, in the movie's key role, as the earnest investigator, who proves himself much more capable than he may appear.  Jason Statham might be best-known for his performances in comic book type action films, but he is a very capable actor, and demonstrates that here.  Wesley Snipes has a complex role, which he executes with flash and style.  The supporting cast is solid and capable, down to the minor roles, helping to add to the film's realism.Chaos is a very well written, nicely paced, entertaining crime thriller.  With a tight timeline, the twist and reveal, fall into place quite neatly.  It is a film that stands up well to repeated viewings.  Though not without flaws, the interesting characters, and smooth execution, makes its imperfections easy to overlook.
