However, it does well for making time fly fast for me. I feel there is too much Corey Feldman in this one; it's too overdone because it is getting clear that he was trying to score future roles based on his ""range"" of acting. Needless to say, the tactic didn't work. Also, there is too much Michael Jackson going on here. In this one, it's apparent that Corey Haim was on drugs in the entire time. I just can see it in his eyes.  All in all, you won't miss a thing if you skipped this one.",2,I'm Requesting a List of Names and Quantity of Drugs that Corey Haim Took During This Film.,1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,626,"['Viewed', '12/11Rate', '412/11', 'Not', 'as', 'horrible', 'initially', 'suspected', 'Dream', 'Little', 'Dream', '2', 'shows', 'very', 'little', 'relevance', 'original', 'However', 'well', 'making', 'time', 'fly', 'fast', 'feel', 'too', 'much', 'Corey', 'Feldman', 'one', 'too', 'overdone', 'getting', 'clear', 'was', 'trying', 'score', 'future', 'roles', 'based', 'range', 'acting', 'Needless', 'say', 'tactic', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Also', 'too', 'much', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'going', 'here', 'one', 'apparent', 'Corey', 'Haim', 'was', 'drugs', 'entire', 'time', 'just', 'can', 'see', 'eyes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'thing', 'skipped', 'one']",Dream a Little Dream 2 VHS

370374,A1AIJX4W864HIY,6303354904,"""rhettbutler2""","[36, 38]","Dream a Little Dream was one of my favorite movies from the 80's.  It had the Corey's with their great style and chemistry together, it had vintage actors like Jason Robards and Piper Laurie and it had Meredith Salenger (whom I could watch read the phone book for 2 hours and not complain).  When I found out there was a SEQUEL I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy.  But, as sequels often are, Dream a Little Dream 2 is a cheap imitation.  The story line is a far stretch at best from the original.  Magic glasses that allow the wearer to control another persons actions, come on.  Robyn Lively takes over as Feldman's love interest (not bad, but she's no Meredith).  Stacie Randall takes a turn as both the Coreys' dream girl and makes for pretty good eye candy, but not very convincing as the villan.  Robards and Laurie are gone which loses alot of the class of the original.  Also, at this point in their careers the Corey's don't have their same flair together as it seems they were starting to outgrow each other and venture out on their own.  Not a horrible movie, but not a worthy sequel to an 80's pop classic.",2,"Well, it sure ain't like the first one",972864000,"10 30, 2000",2000,1124,"['Dream', 'Little', 'Dream', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', '80', 'had', 'Corey', 'great', 'style', 'chemistry', 'together', 'had', 'vintage', 'actors', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Piper', 'Laurie', 'had', 'Meredith', 'Salenger', 'whom', 'could', 'watch', 'read', 'phone', 'book', '2', 'hours', 'not', 'complain', 'When', 'found', 'there', 'was', 'SEQUEL', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'hands', 'copy', 'sequels', 'often', 'are', 'Dream', 'Little', 'Dream', '2', 'cheap', 'imitation', 'story', 'line', 'far', 'stretch', 'best', 'original', 'Magic', 'glasses', 'allow', 'wearer', 'control', 'persons', 'actions', 'come', 'Robyn', 'Lively', 'over', 'Feldman', 'love', 'interest', 'not', 'bad', 'Meredith', 'Stacie', 'Randall', 'turn', 'Coreys', 'dream', 'girl', 'pretty', 'good', 'eye', 'candy', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'villan', 'Robards', 'Laurie', 'are', 'gone', 'alot', 'class', 'original', 'Also', 'point', 'careers', 'Corey', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'flair', 'together', 'were', 'starting', 'outgrow', 'other', 'venture', 'out', 'own', 'Not', 'horrible', 'movie', 'not', 'worthy', 'sequel', '80', 'pop', 'classic']",Dream a Little Dream 2 VHS
