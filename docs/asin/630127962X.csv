The story of young Heloise meeting her soul partner in mature and established Abelard whose career as a philosopher and teacher requires him to be celibate in life makes this forbidden love so heart wrenching to watch. Their obstacles were those even ahead of their time with an out of wedlock pregnancy and escaping the ""evil uncle"" who when discovers this affair had begun under his own roof takes matters into a wicked extreme which changes the outcome of this love affair. Such a hard movie to find on the market, but for the die hard romantics out there its worth every minute to watch. The actors are so convincing in their roles it just makes you wonder ;) If you ever go to Paris, Abelard and Heloise are buried together (according to legend) in the famous cemetery Cimeti&egrave;re du P&egrave;re Lachaise.

The casting and cinematograhy were supurb.Two versions of this film exist on videotape.  The unrated version is by far the best, although EXTREMELY graphic.  The ""R"" rated version toned the explicit material down significantly -- but also cut much material which had nothing to do with any ""racy"" scenes, and really did damage to the plot line.As an additional ""plus"", some of the historical liberties which the author of the novel took (see my review for details) were greatly toned down in the film.An enjoyable, historical film -- but not for everyone.

248893,A1BRXLFWILNICE,630127962X,Robin McDonald,"[33, 34]","I did not know the story of Heloise and Abelard before seeing this movie. The story is based on letters of a 12th century couple who had a very passionate relationship who are eventually separated by social and religious forces that inevitably lead each into lives of celebacy. Yet they maintained a lengthly long distance relationship relating to each other their continued passion for each other and sexual longing.  The story is by its nature very erotic and the film was given an X rating in its full form.  The R rated version is pretty much the same but the film is cropped a bit to mask the male and female naughty bits. However the directors cut is not so explicit as to be considered pornographic. The film is historically interesting and by the end you will have an education on the story of Heloise and Abelard from their meeting to the grave. The film is beautifully captured with pretty cinematography and nice authentic looking period sets and costuming. The film sets up an interesting relationship of Abelard who most believes in pursuing God and Heloise who most believes in pursuing happiness. The reason the film works on any level is Kim Thompson as Heloise. She possesses a glorious mane of Irish red hair, delicate facial features, beautiful transparent skin and slender feminine figure.  But beyond that she conveys a clever alert mind and a passion about her intellect that matches her passion elsewhere in the film.  With the exception of Denholm Elliot playing Fulbert as the fly in their romance, most of the other performances are less invigorating. The story does an adequate job of dramatizing the letters. But the centerpiece of the film is the well shot and set up lovemaking of two people who wrestle with their minds first before wrestling their bodies... which is very sexy. (If possible this film would rate 3 and a half stars.)",3,History and passion meet,993340800,"06 24, 2001",2001,1864,"['did', 'not', 'know', 'story', 'Heloise', 'Abelard', 'seeing', 'movie', 'story', 'based', 'letters', '12th', 'century', 'couple', 'who', 'had', 'very', 'passionate', 'relationship', 'who', 'are', 'eventually', 'separated', 'social', 'religious', 'forces', 'inevitably', 'lead', 'lives', 'celebacy', 'maintained', 'lengthly', 'long', 'distance', 'relationship', 'relating', 'other', 'continued', 'passion', 'other', 'sexual', 'longing', 'story', 'nature', 'very', 'erotic', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'X', 'rating', 'full', 'form', 'R', 'rated', 'version', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'film', 'cropped', 'bit', 'mask', 'male', 'female', 'naughty', 'bits', 'However', 'directors', 'cut', 'not', 'so', 'explicit', 'be', 'considered', 'pornographic', 'film', 'historically', 'interesting', 'end', 'will', 'have', 'education', 'story', 'Heloise', 'Abelard', 'meeting', 'grave', 'film', 'beautifully', 'captured', 'pretty', 'cinematography', 'nice', 'authentic', 'looking', 'period', 'sets', 'costuming', 'film', 'up', 'interesting', 'relationship', 'Abelard', 'who', 'most', 'pursuing', 'God', 'Heloise', 'who', 'most', 'pursuing', 'happiness', 'reason', 'film', 'level', 'Kim', 'Thompson', 'Heloise', 'glorious', 'mane', 'Irish', 'red', 'hair', 'delicate', 'facial', 'features', 'beautiful', 'transparent', 'skin', 'slender', 'feminine', 'figure', 'conveys', 'clever', 'alert', 'mind', 'passion', 'intellect', 'passion', 'elsewhere', 'film', 'exception', 'Denholm', 'Elliot', 'playing', 'Fulbert', 'fly', 'romance', 'most', 'other', 'performances', 'are', 'less', 'invigorating', 'story', 'adequate', 'job', 'dramatizing', 'letters', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'well', 'shot', 'set', 'up', 'lovemaking', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'wrestle', 'minds', 'first', 'wrestling', 'bodies', 'very', 'sexy', 'possible', 'film', 'would', 'rate', '3', 'half', 'stars']",N/A

I was really expecting a great romance :( To me I think their romance was too rushed, I would have liked to have seen some more interatctions before this couple before just jumping into bed together lol. Now this doesn't happen till about halfway through the movie but the main characters only see each other three or four times before they just have sex. She meets him in the street for the first time, then she meets him again at her uncle's and then...well they do meet quite a bit lol I just felt that only one scene actually showed me their conflict at least his anyway. From the beginning I didn't like Elouise...sorry!  ! just found her disrespectful and obnoxious but this was all to show just how intelligent she was though I personally just saw it as her being willfully confrontational. I think I might have liked this movie more if the heroine was at least somewhat believable...and I understand that it was a true story! lol Well if she did in fact act that way in the middle ages then she was a very rare woman. I think it could have been so much more if I actually felt a connection between these two. Perhaps it was just me, I was expecting something more from all the five star reviews lol I think they did have a connection somewhat it just came out of nowhere for me.
