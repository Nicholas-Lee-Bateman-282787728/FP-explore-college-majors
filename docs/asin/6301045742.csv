243949,A2VGNBDNCKQLTM,6301045742,Nathan Southern,"[18, 19]","&quot;Cross My Heart&quot; went virtually unnoticed upon release in 1987, (following on the heels of Martin Short's success in &quot;Innerspace&quot;). I hope it's headed for sleeper status, because  it's a *wonderful* little seriocomedy, about two people with a remarkable  amount of attraction to each other, who lack the confidence and courage to  be open about their lives and their feelings during a third date. The  characters are three-dimensional, Short and O'Toole have a sizzling  chemistry, and the script is appropriately low-key and subtle. It isn't  accurate to call &quot;Cross My Heart&quot; a &quot;date from hell&quot;  movie, because it doesn't fall into the same category as comedy-of-errors  films, like &quot;After Hours&quot; or &quot;Into the Night,&quot; where  two people are thrust into a series of disasters. Instead, most of the  characters' problems and conflicts spring from slight inadequacies and  insecurities, and they retain a basic compatibility that *will* enable them  to succeed, if they can only overcome a few obstacles and be straight with  each other. The film is a little stagy (three or four major sequences, with  the two leads carrying all of the weight), but remains touching, funny, and  relatable; it has a emotional aura over it (like Emile Ardolino's  &quot;Chances Are&quot;) that is rare in romantic comedies. As usual,  Annette O'Toole demonstrates why she is one of the most gifted, appealing,  and underrated actresses in American cinema. The film is a pleasant  surprise -- definitely take a look, you'll be rewarded.",4,Pleasant Surprise,961804800,"06 24, 2000",2000,1576,"['quot', 'Cross', 'My', 'Heart', 'quot', 'went', 'virtually', 'unnoticed', 'release', '1987', 'following', 'heels', 'Martin', 'Short', 'success', 'quot', 'Innerspace', 'quot', 'hope', 'headed', 'sleeper', 'status', '*wonderful*', 'little', 'seriocomedy', 'about', 'two', 'people', 'remarkable', 'amount', 'attraction', 'other', 'who', 'lack', 'confidence', 'courage', 'be', 'open', 'lives', 'feelings', 'third', 'date', 'characters', 'are', 'three-dimensional', 'Short', ""O'Toole"", 'have', 'sizzling', 'chemistry', 'script', 'appropriately', 'low-key', 'subtle', ""n't"", 'accurate', 'call', 'quot', 'Cross', 'My', 'Heart', 'quot', 'quot', 'date', 'hell', 'quot', 'movie', ""n't"", 'fall', 'same', 'category', 'comedy-of-errors', 'films', 'quot', 'Hours', 'quot', 'quot', 'Into', 'Night', 'quot', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'thrust', 'series', 'disasters', 'Instead', 'most', 'characters', 'problems', 'conflicts', 'spring', 'slight', 'inadequacies', 'insecurities', 'retain', 'basic', 'compatibility', 'enable', 'succeed', 'can', 'only', 'overcome', 'few', 'obstacles', 'be', 'straight', 'other', 'film', 'little', 'stagy', 'three', 'four', 'major', 'sequences', 'two', 'leads', 'carrying', 'weight', 'touching', 'funny', 'relatable', 'emotional', 'aura', 'Emile', 'Ardolino', 'quot', 'Chances', 'Are', 'quot', 'rare', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'usual', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'why', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'appealing', 'underrated', 'actresses', 'American', 'cinema', 'film', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'definitely', 'take', 'look', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded']",Cross My Heart VHS

But, none such was the case, and never will be at this point.""Cross My Heart"" is a fun little film that has some moments of unbelievability, but also a lot of ""1980s""-ness going for it as well.  I don't have too much to say about it.  Supposed third date jitters are the topic of this flick, as well as the veil of secrecy that both man and woman put up to impress the other.It's warm hearted and well meant.  Me, I never thought anyone would be daring to show dating on such an intimate level and with a name cast, but I guess it had to happen at some time.Fun 80's stuff for those who were 20-somethings or 30-somethings during that time.
