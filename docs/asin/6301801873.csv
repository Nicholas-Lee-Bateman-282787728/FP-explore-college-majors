This film begins with a teenagers dream of becoming a cowboy and tears it  down as the youth realizes what being a cowboy is really about. In many  ways the film UNFORGIVEN by Clint Eastwood does the same thing only with  gunfighters instead of cowboys.  THE CULPEPPER CATTLE CO. is a much better  film.  It moves faster and has better characters.For years I have  tried to rent or buy this movie. Almost no stores have it or have even  heard of It. I finally found it at a video store that was liquidating its  previously viewed films.  I am so glad Amazon is now offering it.

True to the iconoclasm of the period, the producers set out to debunk the mystique of the cattle drive, and in the process take a big swipe at that arch-romancer of the Old West, John Ford. They only half-succeed. Put simply, their stab at realism is undone by too much gunplay, too much blood, and way too much conventional violence. Staples of the ordinary Western, their presence here only serves to reinforce the usual cliches. Much better when the story-telling cowboy refuses Geoffrey Lewis's challenge by quitting the drive, saying a gunfight over trifling matters makes no sense. That's certainly no cliche.The role reversal at movie's end is stunning, given what Hollywood has led us to  expect. Nevertheless, it works by bringing out a latent code of honor that at times can guide even the most brutal among us. Here Ford is trumped by Kurosawa. There are many fine touches in the movie. Billy &quot;Green&quot; Bush is totally convincing as the ruthless trail boss; Gary Grimes, appropriately callow; and the four gunsels, alternately abusive and sullen, while Geoffrey Lewis's cold-eyed stare bespeaks a lifetime of casual cruelty.

Sure, it's got its faults - the narrative doesn't really flow smoothly but instead is made up of a series of incidents, and the final battle at the Mormon camp, while thrilling, doesn't quite jell with the rest of the movie - but it's always been a personal favourite with me. It's your basic coming of age tale with Gary Grimes signing on for a cattle drive and watching all his friends die through a series of violent incidents. And what a band of companions - some of the best western character actors doing what I feel is their best work. Geoffery Lewis, Bo Hopkins and Luke Askew are great as the supposed good guys who aren't above killing unarmed people in cold blood, while John McLiam has never been nastier as the land hungry cattle baron who causes Grimes and his cynical sidekicks to make a final stand to protect the beleaguered Mormons. The music (composed in part by Jerry Goldsmith) and the sepia cinematography help to create a sense of what I guess the west was really like. And even though that final gunfight seems tacked on, it's still one of the best shoot-outs you'll see in a western (I'd rate it up there with the final bloodbath of The Wild Bunch and the Northfield raid in The Long Riders).

The difficulties experienced on the drive, from outlaws, land-owners whose land they must cross, conspiratorial townspeople and the brutal hard work of the drovers are palpably real and believable.If you like Western movies, you will love this one.

It takes a fairly basic but relevant coming of age story and sets it in the American West. But the ""been there-done that"" stuff gives way to something that has extremely heavy Peckinpah influences. Like ""The Wild Bunch"" (and Bo Hopkins gets to reprise his Clarence ""Crazy"" Lee role) this becomes a violent anti-violence film with blurred lines between ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"". As with Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"", moral ambiguity is the theme and it is not until near the end that the four drovers, pressed to finally take a moral stand, redeem themselves with a final act of personal responsibility.In addition to a good characterization from Hopkins, Geoffry Lewis plays the wrapped a little too tight ""Russ"" with an over-the-top Gary Oldham-like flare, and Luke Askew does a masterful job as the drover who provides early clues that these are four guys who have had to subordinate their basic goodness in order to survive in this environment. Billy Green Bush plays ""Frank Culpepper"" who remains focused on business to the exclusion of any lost causes. Bush played the likable ""Elton"" in ""Five Easy Pieces"" who was responsible for the classic Nicholson line: ""don't tell me about the good life Elton, the good life makes me want to puke"".Also exceptional is the cinematography and the production design. Back in the ancient 1970's, only the high budget pictures had production designers. The others had to rely on the cinematographer to make sure the art director, the set designer, and the make-up/costume people were all on the same page; so that the picture had a consistent look. Ralph Woolsey was one of the better cinematographers at keeping all these elements under control.It became popular after Robert Altman's ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" (1971) to replace the well-scrubbed Roy Rogers look and portray the west as dirty, dusty, gritty, unshaven, and tattered. Woolsey eagerly embraced this realism in 1972 and gave us two of the grimiest features we are likely to see; the excellent ""Culpepper Cattle Company"" and the somewhat lame ""Dirty Little Billy"".The shootout scene in the saloon (midway into the film) is more climatic than the final scene. Not until ""The Unforgiven"" has there been so much action-so fast-on such a tiny set; yet Woolsey captured it all and the post-production people assembled it into a neat and logically sequenced package. So you can follow the whole thing with very little confusion.Then again, what do I know?

In 1866 Texas as wounds are still healed from the Civil War, Ben Mockbridge is a teenager looking to become a cowboy.  He's in luck when a man named Frank Culpepper is driving a herd 2,000 miles north to Fort Lewis, Colorado.  Ben's hired as the cook's assistant.  Whatever he had in mind for what the life of a cowboy was like is quickly put to rest.  The cowboys have long hours, little rest, lousy food and more than likely will end up with a bullet in their guts.  Like many westerns from the 70s, this one doesn't glamorize anything about the wild west.  It shows what a cattle drive was most likely actually like.  Not as well known as many similar toned westerns from the 70s, but it's one of the best.Fresh off the success of Summer of '42, Gary Grimes plays Ben Mockridge, the youngster who would like nothing more than to become a cowboy.  Grimes only made a handful of movies, but like here he shows what a good actor he was.  Billy Green Bush stars as Frank Culpepper, the no-nonsense trail driver trying to get his herd to market as problems mount up along the trail.  The supporting cast of cowboys is a who's who list of great character actors including Geoffrey Lewis, Luke Askew, Bo Hopkins, Wayne Sutherlin, Matt Clark, Raymond Guth, and Jerry Gatlin.  It's Askew who makes the most memorable impression as a cowboy named Luke who looks out for Ben when no one else will.At under $10, you can't go wrong with the movie.

""The Culpepper Cattle Co."" portrays cowhands as considerably more violent and asocial than they likely were.""C3"" was an early revisionist Western. It's admired for its attention to period detail, most-tellingly when Frank Culpepper leans on a water barrel. His hand is brown, but the part of his arm under his sleeve is white. People rarely removed clothing in public (there's an amusing scene in which the cook is embarrassed at having his shirt off to wash up), and certainly not to get a tan, a mark of the working class. Consequently, farmers and ranchers had ""fish bodies"" -- disrobed, most of their skin was a sickly white.""C3""'s only obvious anachronism is that many of the hands have full beards. Contemporary photographs show that cowboys were often mustached, rarely bearded. Perhaps the producers wanted the characters to look ""scruffy"". For whatever reason, the error continues (eg, ""3:10 to Yuma""). As an unrepentant bearded guy, I appreciate it, but it's incorrect.""C3"" is also noted for its violence. Frank Culpepper and his hands don't hesitate killing people (sometimes gleefully -- two of them laugh in a way that suggests sheep bleating) who've offended, usually by stealing something and refusing to give it back. A line of dialog suggests Culpepper is a reformed gunfighter, but this isn't elaborated on. The ending is especially brutal for a PG film (there was no PG-13 at the time) -- not to mention heavily ironic and distasteful. (The leader of the religious community CCC protects turns out to be hypocritical and ungrateful.)Given the film's violence, the general understatement of the script, acting, and directing are welcome, as ""C3"" would otherwise come across as uncomfortably over-the-top.The transfer is from what appears to be a good print. The high overall quality suggests that a Blu-ray transfer from the composite negative would be a good idea.Certainly a classic (of sorts), and definitely worth seeing.
