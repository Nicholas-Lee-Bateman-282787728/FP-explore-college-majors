18739,AZSN1TO0JI87B,0767827716,A. Estes,"[2, 5]","Poor Arnie just can't catch a break. He's the school's prototypical nerd and resident punching bag for his meathead classmates. Even worse, he can't get a date, can't get his locker open and can't beat his mom atScrabble. All of that changes the day he meets Christine. Sure, Christine is a little rough on the eyes and she's been around the block more than a few times, but she's got a great body and really knows how to ride. Problem is, Christine has a hot temper and her loyalty to Arnie is matched only by her thirst for blood. Christine is no ordinary girl; she's a 1958 Plymouth Fury and she's taking Arnie for the ride of his life.Keith Gordon plays no more Mr. Nice Guy Arnie Cunningham and watching his transformation from awkward geek to cocky hothead is half of the film's fun. The other half, of course, is watching the film's titular character mow down its owner's classmates in varied grisly fashion. Director John Carpenter - already a certified Master of Horror by this point - steers the course steadily with ample character build-up, signature creepy music and, of course, mounting tension. You sort of forget the ridiculousness of the premise because not only does Carpenter pull out all the stops, but also because Keith Gordon sells his character so well. Of course, the true star of the show, Christine (reportedly played by 21 different cars) steals the thunder with some of the more memorable moments being her birth (witness George Thorogood's ""Bad to the Bone"" before it was trite and clich&eacute;d) and her own stop-motion rebuilding which had to be painstaking yet entertaining to try to film. There are things in the film that you simply won't see elsewhere, guaranteed.Truth be told, ""Christine"" isn't without a few speed bumps. In all honesty, it's a little long-winded and there's this nagging feeling by the end of it all that something is missing. More specifically, we never quite find out why Christine is the way she is. Does she need an oil change? Does she have a tear in her upholstery? The film loses a bit of credibility by not at least trying to establish a reason for Christine's madness. Even still, it's a thoroughly entertaining film if you love revenge-fantasies and/or cars. At the very least, it's one of the best Stephen King adaptations amidst some pretty mediocre fare. It won't make you fear muscle cars, but maybe you'll think twice about defecating on someone's dashboard ever again.",4,She Drives Me Crazy (3.5 stars),1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,2441,"['Poor', 'Arnie', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'catch', 'break', 'school', 'prototypical', 'nerd', 'resident', 'punching', 'bag', 'meathead', 'classmates', 'Even', 'worse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'date', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'locker', 'open', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'mom', 'atScrabble', 'day', 'Christine', 'Sure', 'Christine', 'little', 'rough', 'eyes', 'been', 'block', 'more', 'few', 'times', 'got', 'great', 'body', 'really', 'knows', 'how', 'ride', 'Problem', 'Christine', 'hot', 'temper', 'loyalty', 'Arnie', 'matched', 'only', 'thirst', 'blood', 'Christine', 'ordinary', 'girl', '1958', 'Plymouth', 'Fury', 'taking', 'Arnie', 'ride', 'life.Keith', 'Gordon', 'more', 'Mr.', 'Nice', 'Guy', 'Arnie', 'Cunningham', 'watching', 'transformation', 'awkward', 'geek', 'cocky', 'hothead', 'film', 'fun', 'other', 'half', 'course', 'watching', 'film', 'titular', 'character', 'mow', 'down', 'owner', 'classmates', 'varied', 'grisly', 'fashion', 'Director', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'already', 'certified', 'Master', 'Horror', 'point', 'course', 'steadily', 'ample', 'character', 'build-up', 'signature', 'creepy', 'music', 'course', 'mounting', 'tension', 'sort', 'forget', 'ridiculousness', 'premise', 'not', 'only', 'Carpenter', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'also', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'character', 'so', 'well', 'course', 'true', 'star', 'show', 'Christine', 'reportedly', 'played', '21', 'different', 'cars', 'thunder', 'more', 'memorable', 'moments', 'being', 'birth', 'witness', 'George', 'Thorogood', 'Bad', 'Bone', 'was', 'trite', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'own', 'stop-motion', 'rebuilding', 'had', 'be', 'painstaking', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'try', 'film', 'are', 'things', 'film', 'simply', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'elsewhere', 'guaranteed.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'Christine', ""n't"", 'few', 'speed', 'bumps', 'honesty', 'little', 'long-winded', 'nagging', 'feeling', 'end', 'something', 'missing', 'More', 'specifically', 'never', 'quite', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Christine', 'way', 'Does', 'need', 'oil', 'change', 'have', 'tear', 'upholstery', 'film', 'bit', 'credibility', 'not', 'least', 'trying', 'establish', 'reason', 'Christine', 'madness', 'Even', 'still', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'love', 'revenge-fantasies', 'and/or', 'cars', 'very', 'least', 'one', 'best', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptations', 'amidst', 'pretty', 'mediocre', 'fare', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'fear', 'muscle', 'cars', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'think', 'twice', 'about', 'defecating', 'someone', 'dashboard', 'ever', 'again']",N/A

Carpenter himself sounded his slight disappointment with the film in some interviews which ultimately led it to be labeled as a failure. Well it isn't. The film based on Stephen King's novel, is an intriguing, atmospheric and extremely suspensful story that works both as a macabre chiller and a psychological thriller. The film also contains some of Carpenter's best visuals as his compositions in this film show his unique talent and taste in composing with the Panavision frame as well as featuring one of his most ambient synth scores. With good performances by John Stockwell, Keith Gordon and Harry Dean Stanton, this is a classic supernatural\psychological mystery that is recommended for Carpenter fans and fans of thrillers alike.",4,An underrated Carpenter classic,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,822,"['Christine', 'one', 'director', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'finest', 'yet', 'less', 'appreciated', 'films', 'Carpenter', 'sounded', 'slight', 'disappointment', 'film', 'interviews', 'ultimately', 'led', 'be', 'labeled', 'failure', ""n't"", 'film', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'intriguing', 'atmospheric', 'extremely', 'suspensful', 'story', 'macabre', 'chiller', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'film', 'also', 'Carpenter', 'best', 'visuals', 'compositions', 'film', 'show', 'unique', 'talent', 'taste', 'composing', 'Panavision', 'frame', 'as', 'well', 'featuring', 'one', 'most', 'ambient', 'synth', 'scores', 'good', 'performances', 'John', 'Stockwell', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'classic', 'supernatural\\psychological', 'mystery', 'recommended', 'Carpenter', 'fans', 'fans', 'thrillers', 'alike']",N/A
18741,A2S244KFX0745K,0767827716,Alan Edward Creager,"[5, 5]","Here there be spoilers.Stephen King's 1983 novel ""Christine"" was adapted to film and released in the same year. Placed in the hands of the brilliant John Carpenter with a budget of $9,700,000, the result was ultimately the best adaptation of a book to film I've yet seen, and one of my favorite movies of all time. There are few better ways, in a movie theater at least, to spend 110 minutes of your life.I won't carry on long about the differences between the standard DVD and this special edition, but I always buy the special edition of a film I like. Some have little in the way of extras, but I found ""Christine"" did not leave me wanting in terms of additional content, either. The list of cut scenes is enjoyable to watch, much as the film itself, and it's always fun to find out how a film like this was made.""Christine"" has an opening that gets attention right away. A car motor, no doubt a powerful one, starts up, revs to a roar a few times, then idles and shuts off as the preliminary credits roll. We then witness a scene on a Detroit assembly line in 1957, in which George Thorogood's ""Bad To the Bone"" is brilliantly chosen as the background song and Christine herself, the only red Plymouth on the line, claims her first victim. See, while it is implied in the book that Roland LeBay's 1958 Plymouth Fury was simply a custom Plymouth early on, this made-to-order '58 Fury is bad right from the very beginning in the film.We soon meet Dennis Guilder and Arnold Cunningham, who have been good friends for years. After a scuffle in auto shop class that is broken up by the brilliantly-played Mr. Casey, the two are soon heading home when they pass by- we don't see what at first. But whatever it is, it grabs Arnie's attention right away, and he demands Dennis go back. Within moments Arnie is running his hands across the bodywork of a rusted but somehow familiar Plymouth, which appears to have been quitely decaying for not just decades but centuries (if that were possible) in a rather unkempt front yard. Dennis is unimpressed, and can hardly believe it when Arnie jumps right up and buys the car from the late owner's brother, George LeBay. See, ol' George must have gotten along with his brother Roland a whole lot better in the film, since he talks of the car much as Roland did. Dennis' attempts to dissuade Arnie fail, as do those of his domineering parents. Their refusal to allow the barely running Plymouth in their driveway introduces us to the cheery and personable Will Darnell, owner of a local junkyard and garage, who after a rant over the car's horrible exhaust allows Arnie to keep the car there.The acting in this film is as good as you could ask for. Keith Gordon and John Stockwell perform superbly as Arnold Cunningham and Dennis Guilder respectively. To name all of the actors who I believe did their jobs well would result in me naming the entire cast, one by one. But my favorites beyond the lead cast were Robert Prosky (Darnell), Roberts Blossom ""George LeBay"", and Harry Dean Staunton as ""Rudolph Junkins"".Witnessing Arnie's transformation from a downtrodden nerd to a hard-eyed, lean fella who nobody crosses is really something, and the film portrays all this very well. People step forward and attempt to harm Arnie, or worse, attempt to harm Christine, and all who make any transgressions suffer terribly. The scene in which Christine rebuilds herself before Arnie's eyes is one of the most brilliantly done moments in film I have yet to witness. This was before the kind of special effects and CGI we take for granted today. In 1983, John Caprenter mounted devices all over one of the Plymouths used to portray Christine and overall destroyed the car, then played all the footage backwards. Genius. The scenes in which Christine takes revenge on those foolish enough to cross her are some of the most gripping in the film, made all the better by the wonderfully-done soundtrack. I very much enjoyed the moment where the unfortunate Moochie Welch sees a rebuilt Christine idling, and calls out to Arnie, who he assumes is inside. ""Hey, you ain't mad, are you?"" Oh, I don't know about Arnie... but Christine is more than just mad. Considering she forces herself up a narrow loading dock and rams Moochie so hard paint is embedded in his bones (as Junkins tells us later) I'd say Christine a lot more than just mad.Consider, also, the amount of time Christine takes in running down her victims. The boys responsible for beating her up in the garage one night suffer most grieviously, and in each case she takes far longer to get rid of them than she'd really have to. But unlike many films where the villian foolishly takes extra time with getting rid of an enemy, Christine simply draws it out, takes her time, but never once fails to get her revenge.Tensions mount in the Cunningham household as one could expect, and Dennis and Arnie's ex-girlfriend Leigh destroy her in Darnell's garage in a dramatic duel to the death between the regenerating 1958 Fury and a bulldozer. Christine's liking for classic 50's music I very much enjoyed, and even as the bulldozer runs her down she's blasting ""Rock and Roll is Here to Stay"" and struggling to get loose.The ending of the film is superbly done. I know I must sound dreadfully repetetive in so widely praising the film, but it's true. I have few if any complaints at all, none very significant. Anyway, the end of the film shows Dennis, Leigh and Detective Junkins looking at the crushed cube that used to be Christine, lamenting Arnie's demise during the battle in the garage. ""Some things can't be helped. Some people, too."" Junkins notes. Just then, we hear rock and roll playing, seeming to come from the remains of Christine. The look on the three people's faces, and the look on the face of the construction worker who has the radio on his shoulder as he walks by, is priceless. ""I hate rock and roll."" Leigh hisses.Soon, the three turn to leave, and the camera zooms in on the ruined, crushed remains of the evil Plymouth. A piece, possibly of the grille, bends ever so slightly back and forth.As if a car like Christine could be stopped so easily.Cut to ""Bad to the Bone"" and the credits. Very nicely done.""Christine"" is adapted from book to film with a kind of skill and respect for the original work that I have yet to see surpassed. To fully adapt the book to film would result in a work lasting over four hours, and Carpenter clearly recognized that. Yet in many cases, I have been inclined to howl over the carelesness with which a director changed the work from one form to another. Not here. I regret the omission of so many subplots and details, but ultimately the final work is so good that I enjoyed it about as much as I did the book itself. ""Christine"" is a movie that I could not only like but love even if I had never read the book it is adapted from, nor ever heard of that most excellent writer, Stephen King. The movie can be appreciated from all angles: as a masterful adaption of written to visual form, as a John Carpenter-directed film, as a Stephen King movie, and simply as a stand-alone film. I cannot think of a time when I have enjoyed going to see a movie more. Among Stephen King film adaptations and among films in general, for me at least, ""Christine"" is as good as it gets.",5,You can't do a book-to-film adaptation any better than this.,1283385600,"09 2,

While the film is structurally flawed - and just barely outperformed the disappointing box-office receipts of ""The Thing"" - it's a movie that nevertheless contains some of his best work, thanks to a reliance on character instead of gory horror.Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Phillips made mostly sound decisions in reworking King's novel for the screen, stripping out some of the more overtly supernatural elements and focusing on the relationship between its central characters: a high school nerd named Arnie (Keith Gordon) and his more popular, football-playing best friend Dennis (John Stockwell) in the late `70s. The perpetually bullied Arnie is teased by a ruthless clan of thugs but soon finds an outlet to escape his social status: a red 1958 Plymouth Fury that he buys from a shady salvage dealer (Roberts Blossom). Arnie sees in ""Christine"" the potential for a sleek cruising vessel that allows him to flee from his high school existence as well as his overly-concerned parents; Dennis, on the other hand, has grave concerns about his best friend's decision, but the connection between the possessed auto and its new owner has already been established. Soon Arnie's geek days are behind him as he snags the new girl in class (Alexandra Paul) and finds his rebirth is perpetually tied to the seemingly ""alive"" car he's rescued off the scrap heap.""Christine"" received some criticism from horror fans over the fact that it's not especially scary - but given the central premise of King's novel, it's hard to imagine what more Carpenter and Phillips could've done to make a ""killer car"" movie more terrifying. Individual shots of Christine, literally on fire, driving down a lonely highway in pursuit of one of the thugs who bullied Arnie earlier in the film are evocative, but the attempt to create and sustain a more psychological form of terror - through Arnie's personality shifting - was a laudable one on the part of the filmmakers. ""Christine"" takes its time - nearly 40 minutes - establishing the relationship between Arnie and Dennis, as well as setting the overall scene. These sequences are some of the most satisfying in Carpenter's entire body of work, with both Gordon and Stockwell coming across as likeable, believable characters.The movie's main weakness is clearly its second act, as Arnie's switch from hapless nerd to confident ladies man happens without a moment's notice. His relationship with Paul's heroine, Leigh, occurs completely off-screen - a severe miscalculation that serves as the largest misstep in Phillips' script, since without that component, it's hard to believe his overnight shift in confidence, or how it's tied into Christine itself. The movie also veers away from seeing the film through the prism of Dennis, who's sidelined with a serious football injury, and the change in perspective likewise curtails the movie's dramatic momentum. It's unfortunate the mid-section of the picture stumbles, because the latter portion of the movie mostly delivers the goods with Carpenter doing what he can to make Christine's killing spree effective, while the presence of veteran character actors like Robert Prosky, Roberts Blossom and Harry Dean Stanton (even if he's mostly underutilized as a detective) add to the entertainment value.""Christine"" may not be a great movie on balance - it's ultimately two-thirds of a really solid genre exercise - but it has its moments, and once you're aware of its shortcomings, repeat viewing makes it easier to appreciate the elements in it that do work well. In a career filled with a couple of classics (""Halloween"" and ""The Thing""), cult favorites and more than a few missed opportunities, it's also one of Carpenter's more low-key thrillers, reliant less on gore (the film is R-rated for excessive profanity as opposed to on-screen violence) and with more of an accent on the people affected by its horrors than the vehicle itself.Announced as one of Twilight Time's March limited-edition Blu-Ray releases, ""Christine"" sold out in a matter of hours once its pre-order went live on the Screen Archives website. The prior bestseller for Twilight Time was ""Fright Night"" - clearly, there's something to be said for the continued popularity of `80s genre films as ""Christine"" was snapped up in a jiffy by eager fans. If you're looking for a copy now, the secondary market is your only option, and prices currently run from $100 and up (barring an overseas, region-free release, it's likely its value may only increase as copies become scarcer).The 1080p AVC encoded transfer licensed from Sony is hugely satisfying, enhancing the work of Carpenter and cinematographer Donald M. Morgan, which is marked by Carpenter's trademark use of Panavision widescreen. The DTS MA 5.1 audio is potent as well, delivering a score filled with period rock tunes and one of the more unobtrusive Carpenter/Alan Howarth collaborations (there's hardly any of their underscore at all in the first hour). Extras are carried over from the Special Edition DVD, including Laurent Bouzereau's insightful three-part documentary, nearly 30 minutes of deleted scenes (none of which would've really helped the movie's middle section), and a fun commentary with Carpenter and Keith Gordon. For folks lucky enough to find a copy, this is a splendid Blu-Ray presentation all around, capped by an isolated score track of Carpenter and Howarth's musical contribution.",4,A Caprenter Favorite

Jake Kincaid, Jack of...","[1, 1]","I'm a huge King fan, and likewise for Carpenter...so in my mind, even back then, when I heard John Carpenter was going to direct a Stephen King movie, I just KNEW it would be the gold standard for all King adaptations to follow.I have to say, whereas I really love this movie, that title still has to go to Hooper for his ""Salem's Lot"", but it really only won by a nose.Ah well...on with the show.This is a simple tale, really, of that ubiquitous Nerd Who Always Gets Picked On, his Jock With A Heart Of Gold best friend, and the Hot New Girl In School...and a black soul of darkness residing in an old car that our geeky hero decides he simply MUST restore, that hides more than fuel lines and exhaust manifolds beneath it's hood.First and foremost, this adaptation is a story of obsession that becomes possession.  Whatever malign entity (obviously female...of course, one of our characters points out that ""All cars are girls"") that dwells within that '58 Fury first entrances our poor, picked on youth, then, like a spider (or jealous seductress), ensnares his very soul within her web.  We see this innocent, just-wants-to-be-accepted guy, in his efforts to win some respect, instead be transformed into the very thing he hates, alienating all those that care for him (an allegory, perhaps?  Well, maybe it's there if you want it).  His friends, desperate to save him, are forced to confront the evil that has taken possession of him, and ultimately...Well, you know the rest if you've seen it.  If you haven't, I'm not going to ruin it.If you've read any of my other reviews, you might have seen that I am a big fan of ""The Car"", so making a car scary isn't that tough of a nut to crack in my opinion, and Carpenter did an outstanding job of making the auto a menacing, fearful juggernaut...although his ""less is more"" style really added to the film, his almost operatic quality imagery in some scenes was truly inspired (the flaming Plymouth careening wildly down the highway as it pursues it's prey is the stuff of nightmares).  As is his practice, there's no gore to speak of, but the dread his staging generates more than makes up for it.Suffice to say, an underrated and excellent little gem...I recommend it to King, Carpenter, and horror fans in general who aren't going to be disappointed if there's not a bloodbath.",4,Just an old-fashioned love triangle...,1284336000,"09 13, 2010",2010,2330,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'King', 'fan', 'likewise', 'Carpenter', 'so', 'mind', 'even', 'back', 'then', 'when', 'heard', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'was', 'going', 'direct', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movie', 'just', 'KNEW', 'would', 'be', 'gold', 'standard', 'King', 'adaptations', 'follow.I', 'have', 'say', 'whereas', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'title', 'still', 'go', 'Hooper', 'Salem', 'Lot', 'really', 'only', 'won', 'nose.Ah', 'well', 'show.This', 'simple', 'tale', 'really', 'ubiquitous', 'Nerd', 'Who', 'Always', 'Gets', 'Picked', 'Jock', 'A', 'Heart', 'Gold', 'best', 'friend', 'Hot', 'New', 'Girl', 'School', 'black', 'soul', 'darkness', 'residing', 'old', 'car', 'geeky', 'hero', 'simply', 'MUST', 'restore', 'more', 'fuel', 'lines', 'exhaust', 'manifolds', 'hood.First', 'foremost', 'adaptation', 'story', 'obsession', 'possession', 'malign', 'entity', 'obviously', 'female', 'course', 'one', 'characters', 'points', 'out', 'cars', 'are', 'girls', ""'58"", 'Fury', 'first', 'poor', 'picked', 'youth', 'then', 'spider', 'jealous', 'seductress', 'very', 'soul', 'web', 'see', 'innocent', 'just-wants-to-be-accepted', 'guy', 'efforts', 'win', 'respect', 'instead', 'be', 'transformed', 'very', 'thing', 'alienating', 'care', 'allegory', 'perhaps', 'Well', 'there', 'want', 'friends', 'desperate', 'save', 'are', 'forced', 'confront', 'evil', 'taken', 'possession', 'ultimately', 'Well', 'know', 'rest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'ruin', 'it.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Car', 'so', 'making', 'car', 'scary', ""n't"", 'tough', 'nut', 'crack', 'opinion', 'Carpenter', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'making', 'auto', 'menacing', 'fearful', 'juggernaut', 'less', 'more', 'style', 'really', 'added', 'film', 'almost', 'operatic', 'quality', 'imagery', 'scenes', 'was', 'truly', 'inspired', 'flaming', 'Plymouth', 'careening', 'wildly', 'highway', 'prey', 'stuff', 'nightmares', 'practice', 'gore', 'speak', 'dread', 'staging', 'generates', 'more', 'up', 'it.Suffice', 'say', 'underrated', 'excellent', 'little', 'gem', 'recommend', 'King', 'Carpenter', 'horror', 'fans', 'general', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'not', 'bloodbath']",N/A

I thought it had a nice first half, although it was somewhat corny, until Arnie started to go wrong. From that point, Christine fell apart like wheels off the car. Perhaps it started when John Stockwell, who played Arnie's friend, disappeared but came back with minuscule screen time. He was the best part of the film since his acting was considerably better than the rest of the cast. The psychological aspect, where John Carpenter was presenting in Christine, was becoming all too obvious, so it got lamer as time passed. While that was going on, the story wasn't too bad at all; it kept the movie going, but there wasn't enough of details to fill in the story behind the car Christine. In the second half of the picture, I notice how the characters were dropping out like flies after being seen for a good deal of time in the first half. Arnie, played by Keith Gordon, is the worst part of the film. I just couldn't stand him, and I preferred the girl, his friend, or anybody else except for Harry Dean Stanton. Logic is punch-holed in Christine. Take the rate of speed by a person. Any average person can run up to twelve miles per hour. Usually, it will be about eight miles per hour. Now, a car...it's just too impossible for the car not to overtake a person no matter how painfully slow it must go. By the logic I present, Christine should have easily killed anybody who was running. It doesn't take very much of speed to get it done. Now, when a person gets killed in a car and is investigated by the police, no doubt the car will be impounded for a good deal of time. It's a surprise that Arnie was able to get his car back that fast. Also, he would have been suspected for murder of Darnell. So, he conceivably has to be under surveillance by a stakeout team. Although there isn't much to comment on Christine, it just didn't work for me. I see great concept but poor direction. Christine isn't a film with the vintage touch donned by John Carpenter. I got confused whether Arnie was driving Christine the whole time or she was driving by herself. If Christine kills, why? I get the jealousy factor, but that didn't show in the beginning.

What I do know is that this film adaption is a fun little thriller, but is far away from being the best film adaption of a King work, or being near the best of the film's director and composer, John Carpenter. The film centers around young, geeky Arnie Cunningham, who is played by Keith Gordon, who is known for his victimized teen in &quot;Jaws 2&quot;, the son of Angie Dickinson in &quot;Dressed To Kill&quot;, and the collegiate son of Rodney Dangerfield in &quot;Back To School&quot;. Arnie is the classic dork. Dark Buddy Holly glasses, poor wardrobe, bad hair, and an unfortunate physique. It doesn't help any that he is also under his parents' iron thumb. He spots a beat up old car one day while out with his best friend Dennis Gilder(John Stockwell), and buys the car on the spot from the creepy old man who was selling it. Dennis tries to talk him out of it, and his parents even more so, but an upset Arnie keeps it and stores at the auto body shop Darnell's, the namesake played by veteran actor Robert Prosky. But the car, named Christine, has a mind of it's own and it's possession of Arnie soon takes hold. He thinks of nothing but the car, stands up to his parents, starts doing his hair different and stops wearing glasses and nerdy clothes and begins dating the cutest girl in school Leigh Capp, who is played by future &quot;Baywatch&quot; star, Alexandra Paul. And when people and bullies get to Arnie, Christine takes care of them all with her special brand of possessive love. Can Dennis and Leigh save Arnie before it's too late?. You'll have to watch to see. Carpenter is a master at fine suspense and thriller, and while this 1983 effort isn't overly scary, he still manages to supply some of his trademark Carpenter creepiness into a number of scenes. Most of which having to do with Christine's midnight jaunts of horror and mayhem. Things are also given the right mood by Carpenter's subtle, but yet eerily effecting score he keeps playing to the right degree in the background. Keith Gordon is the best of the bunch. He really delivers a contained and realistic performance of a high school nerd dealing with the pressures of every day life that range from strict parents, to bullies in the school hallways, and to generally being a social outcast. He impresses the viewer further when the transformation takes place and gets stronger, more bolder, and grows a back bone. Good job. The rest are all solid enough, especially Prosky, and Harry Dean Stanton who appears in a surprisingly small role as a detective, but it is Gordon that owns the movie and makes the biggest impression. Stockwell is a very likeable presence and has a nice charm to him, but Alexandra Paul is barely given enough time to become a character and before you know it she is already involved with Arnie and the crisis that ensues. One of the film's best assets is the use of old time rock and roll that is peppered throughout the movie. George Thorogood's &quot;Bad To The Bone&quot; is especially perfect for the nature of the film. And while I have given mostly good things to say about the film, it isn't without it's flaws. The biggest question, and biggest flaw, that never got answered was how Christine got to be the kind of car she was. Maybe it was in the book and I can't remember or I just missed something, but why not give a little explanation as to why the car was possessed?. Besides all that, the film is solidly put together into a pretty okay package that would certainly be fun for a nostalgic trip back to early 1980's terror.",3,Cruisin' For A Bruisin',1072569600,"12 28, 2003",2003,3956,"['Stephen', 'King', 'movies', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'spotty', 'get', 'good', 'ones', 'going', 'mediocre', 'bad', 'ones', 'immediatley', 'come', 'back', 'fourth', 'film', 'adaption', 'King', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'somewhere', ""'okay"", ""'pretty"", 'decent', 'read', 'book', '8', '9', 'years', 'ago', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'knowledge', 'differences', 'book', 'movie', 'practically', 'non-existent', 'What', 'do', 'know', 'film', 'adaption', 'fun', 'little', 'thriller', 'far', 'away', 'being', 'best', 'film', 'adaption', 'King', 'work', 'being', 'best', 'film', 'director', 'composer', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'centers', 'young', 'geeky', 'Arnie', 'Cunningham', 'who', 'played', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'who', 'known', 'victimized', 'teen', 'quot', 'Jaws', '2', 'quot', 'son', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'quot', 'Dressed', 'Kill', 'quot', 'collegiate', 'son', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield', 'quot', 'Back', 'School', 'quot', 'Arnie', 'classic', 'dork', 'Dark', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'poor', 'wardrobe', 'bad', 'hair', 'unfortunate', 'physique', ""n't"", 'help', 'also', 'parents', 'iron', 'thumb', 'spots', 'beat', 'up', 'old', 'car', 'one', 'day', 'out', 'best', 'friend', 'Dennis', 'Gilder', 'John', 'Stockwell', 'car', 'spot', 'creepy', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'selling', 'Dennis', 'talk', 'parents', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'upset', 'Arnie', 'stores', 'auto', 'body', 'shop', 'Darnell', 'namesake', 'played', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Prosky', 'car', 'named', 'Christine', 'mind', 'own', 'possession', 'Arnie', 'soon', 'hold', 'nothing', 'car', 'up', 'parents', 'doing', 'hair', 'different', 'stops', 'wearing', 'glasses', 'nerdy', 'clothes', 'dating', 'cutest', 'girl', 'school', 'Leigh', 'Capp', 'who', 'played', 'future', 'quot', 'Baywatch', 'quot', 'star', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'when', 'people', 'bullies', 'get', 'Arnie', 'Christine', 'care', 'special', 'brand', 'possessive', 'love', 'Can', 'Dennis', 'Leigh', 'save', 'Arnie', 'too', 'late', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'Carpenter', 'master', 'fine', 'suspense', 'thriller', '1983', 'effort', ""n't"", 'overly', 'scary', 'still', 'supply', 'trademark', 'Carpenter', 'creepiness', 'number', 'scenes', 'Most', 'having', 'do', 'Christine', 'midnight', 'jaunts', 'horror', 'mayhem', 'Things', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'right', 'mood', 'Carpenter', 'subtle', 'yet', 'eerily', 'effecting', 'score', 'playing', 'right', 'degree', 'background', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'best', 'bunch', 'really', 'contained', 'realistic', 'performance', 'high', 'school', 'dealing', 'pressures', 'day', 'life', 'range', 'strict', 'parents', 'bullies', 'school', 'hallways', 'generally', 'being', 'social', 'outcast', 'viewer', 'further', 'when', 'transformation', 'place', 'stronger', 'more', 'bolder', 'back', 'bone', 'Good', 'job', 'rest', 'are', 'solid', 'enough', 'especially', 'Prosky', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'small', 'role', 'detective', 'Gordon', 'movie', 'biggest', 'impression', 'Stockwell', 'very', 'likeable', 'presence', 'nice', 'charm', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'barely', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'become', 'character', 'know', 'already', 'involved', 'Arnie', 'crisis', 'One', 'film', 'best', 'assets', 'use', 'old', 'time', 'rock', 'roll', 'peppered', 'movie', 'George', 'Thorogood', 'quot', 'Bad', 'Bone', 'quot', 'especially', 'perfect', 'nature', 'film', 'have', 'given', 'mostly', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'flaws', 'biggest', 'question', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'never', 'got', 'answered', 'was', 'how', 'Christine', 'got', 'be', 'kind', 'car', 'was', 'Maybe', 'was', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'just', 'missed', 'something', 'why', 'not', 'give', 'little', 'explanation', 'why', 'car', 'was', 'possessed', 'film', 'solidly', 'put', 'together', 'pretty', 'okay', 'package', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'fun', 'nostalgic', 'trip', 'back', 'early', '1980', 'terror']",N/A

Soon after this, Arnie falls in love with a rusty, red-and white 1958 Plymouth Fury owned and named ""Christine"" by decrepit and sleazy-looking George LeBay (Roberts Blossom).  Going against the advice of his domineering parents and best friend Dennis, Arnie buys the junky-looking car and becomes obsessed with the idea of overhauling it until it is in perfect condition and he becomes popular and highly respected as its owner.  He is wildly successful in this enterprise and becomes close to his pretty and popular girlfriend Leigh (Alexandra Paul).  Arnie soon finds out that Christine has a mind of her own.  The movie flawlessly presents a series of incidents revealing Christine's likes and dislikes, her sense of justice, willingness to act in the name of justice and ability to repair herself, regardless of the extent of damage she might receive.  When bully Repperton and his gang viciously trash Christine, she restores herself, then goes after and kills each and every one of those who showed her disrespect.  Christine becomes a formidable threat to anyone who would harm Arnie, herself or anyone who interferes with the bonds of love that exist between her and Arnie.  Knowledge of this frightens Leigh who thinks Christine might be jealous of her and want to kill her.  Leigh becomes certain that she is right and asks for help from Arnie's best friend Dennis.  Dennis agrees with Leigh and decides he must kill Christine before she creates a tragedy by murdering Leigh.  This leads to a thrilling battle scene in a garage housing Christine and massive construction machinery with a frightened Leigh proudly watching a heroic Dennis using stored, engine-driven machinery to attack Christine who fights back viciously and repairs each damaging blow.  Dennis appears to be the winner and the movie's surprisingly startling ending sheds light on the truth of this.

Of course, what we see is a rusted-out pile of junk. Arnie sees Christine with the intoxicated eyes of love. Arnie buys her and she becomes the object of Arnie's obsession and center of his universe. Soon, Arnie's personality begins to change. His nerdy innocence is replaced by a coarse, arrogant persona.

The special effects are still great (and so is the soundtrack), but the plot about highschool bullying and overbearing parents that I used to find interesting now just comes off as one-dimensional and dull.  The main character isn't very sympathetic even before he becomes corrupted by the car, so no matter how dislikeable the bullies are, you never feel much sympathy for him either.  For your approximately 2 hours of viewing, you get to see a boring geek turn into an egotistical jerk and eventually run down a couple of bullies with his car.

The book was my favorite King book and the movie is my favorite adaptation. While not necessarily a scary horror movie that will leave you feeling disturbed after watching it, it is definitely creepy, fun to watch the way certain scary movies can be, and might make you look around twice before crossing a quiet &#34;deserted?&#34; street late at night in the dark. The use of the oldie-goldie songs throughout the movie adds to its creepiness as does John Carpenter's amazing score.As I said, the book is my favorite of Stephen King's and I definitely recommend it but I almost dare say that the film adaptation was even better because of the way the film changed the identity of the villain. I don't believe I am spoiling anything when I say that the book focuses on the previous owner of Christine- Roland LeBay- as being the source of evil who possesses Arnie and therefore Christine while the movie portrays the car itself being haunted and possessing Arnie. This works so much better in the film because it leaves the car to be the feared one. Anyway, it's a great story with a definite creep factor. The male leads are great- John Stockwell and Keith Gordon. This dvd is great because it has 3 featurettes telling you quite a bit about the making of the movie. There is also a movie commentary by John Carpenter and Keith Gordon that is funny and interesting.I had bought this movie on dvd when it was first released and it was fine but when I learned they released a newer dvd with bonus features I had to get it. I was not disappointed except that I am so tired of having to replace my dvds with newer dvds because of the bonus material. First I had to replace my blank tape recordings of the movies with the VHS versions, then the VHS versions with the dvd versions and then the dvd versions with the Bonus/ Anniversary/ Special etc Edition dvds.

18765,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,0767827716,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[7, 10]","While watching Christine (1983) last night, I couldn't help but think how sweet it would be to have a car like the one in the film...oh, I don't mean all freaky deaky possessed with an evil that will ultimately consume you completely and stuff like that, but having a car that regenerates itself after a fender bender...your old buddy here had a few accidents a long time ago and knows body shops charge an arm, a leg, and your first born...and if you mess up the frame, forget about it...based on a novel by Stephen King, directed by John Carpenter (Halloween), the film stars Keith Gordon (Jaws 2, Back to School), John Stockwell (Losin' It, My Science Project), and Alexandra Paul, whom many may recognize as the comparatively less buxom than the rest of the female cast Stephanie from the Baywatch television series.  Also appearing is Robert Prosky (The Great Outdoors), William Ostrander (Mulholland Dr.), Roberts Blossom (Escape from Alcatraz), Kelly Preston (Mischief), and Harry Dean Stanton (Cool Hand Luke, Alien, Repo Man).As the film begins, we roll into a character establishment sequence as the year is 1957 (the date is displayed on the screen) and we're watching newly built cars coming off an auto assembly line (check out those fins...even if they didn't show us the year, we probably could have guessed it based on the design of the cars).  We end up focusing on one in particular, a red beauty, and given this is a John Carpenter film based off a Stephen King novel, you know something nasty bad is going to happen soon, and it does, indicating this car may be more than just the sum of its parts.  Anyway, flash forward to 1979 and we meet Arnie Cunningham (Gordon).  To say Arnie is a nerd would be an understatement.  If you took all the nerdy, gawky, awkward, nebbish, constantly picked on, harangued by their mothers schlubs you can remember from high school and rolled them into one, you'd probably end up with Arnie Cunningham.  But for as much as Arnie has going against him, he does have at least one thing going for him in his sincere friendship Dennis (Stockwell), the very cool and popular dude who drives a bitchin' car and happens to be the star of the school football team.  Arnie's life isn't ideal by any means, especially since he's just recently run afoul of the school bully Buddy Repperton (Ostrander) and his gang, but what are you gonna do?  Well, I guess you could buy a possessed car named Christine...and that's what he does (okay, he doesn't know it's possessed)...the car is a piece of junk, but Arnie sees something in it, and begins working on restoring it, causing his other relationships to suffer, but, as the car comes along, we see Arnie changing as well (he actually develops a sense of confidence and a personality to boot), dropping the nerd routine and even garnering the attentions of the new girl (Paul), but, as with any silver lining, there's always a dark cloud behind it, and the price for Arnie's newfound coolness may be more than he's willing to pay...All right, you must be thinking `A John Carpenter movie based off a Stephen King book?  This movie must be scary as hell!'...well, it's not...it's not very scary at all, at least to me it wasn't, but then I've been desensitized by years frightening cinematic visages.  There was one part that makes me jump a little every time I see it, but I'm not going to tell you what it is...what this film lacks in frights, it makes up for in being not only entertaining, but also just really cool.  I liked all the characters, and I thought Keith Gordon did really well embodying the complete nerd who finds love in an unlikely place, a love that most of us think we would want (not for the damn car, but the essence represented in the car, in terms of it being an entity like ourselves) until we realize it's not so much love as a crazy, obsessive, all devouring devotion intent on taking us to a place no one should ever have to go...I thought the supporting cast did all right, but I would have liked to seen a little more of Stanton (he played a police detective) and Ostrander's characters as they seemed interesting despite their limited roles.  There was one sticking point with me with regards to the characters in that I find it very hard to believe any normal guy would choose Alexandra Paul over Kelly Preston, as John Stockwell's character did...both women are attractive, to be sure, but come on...I've seen Preston in the film Mischief (1985), so I know what she's got going on, and let me tell you, it's a lot.  Anyway, I thought the direction was very good as Carpenter did an excellent job in creating not only a living, breathing, tire squealing character in Christine, but maintaining an appropriate atmosphere throughout the film, especially by his choice of music.  There are some minor gaffs here and there, but nothing that spoiled the overall experience.  I think my favorite scene comes after a gang completely trashes Arnie's car, which then `heals' thy self through whatever bad mojo it's got going on, and then seeks revenge against those offenders (Arnie's uses a different term, one I can't put in the review).  There's a scene involving a car, engulfed in flames, speeding down the highway...very cool...This review is for the `Special Edition', and the widescreen anamorphic picture (2.35:1) looks really sharp.  I was a little disappointed in the audio, which I think is available in Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround and Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono, as it was too soft at times.  There are some extras including 20 deleted/alternative scenes, 3 featurettes titled Christine: Fast and Furious, Christine: Ignition, and Christine: Finish Line, filmographies, and previews.  Again, this review was for the Special Edition, and I know there was a previously released edition, but I don't know if the features I spoke of are available on both editions, so make sure of what you're getting before purchasing, especially since Amazon has a tendancy to cross-reference reviews despite product differences.Cookieman108",4,"""It seems like nobody likes my car these

Man, that sounds silly but, if you're reading this you have probably watched the movie so no sense going into details. It's hard to describe the story in a paragraph without it sounding stupid....but it's not. Maybe the quickest way to explain it is that it is about a car that is alive, like a human, and you mess with it, you pay!It is definitely one creepy, well-made, unique and always-entertaining film.

It isn't as beloved by his fans as, say, Escape from New York and it isn't as crappy as Memoirs of an Invisible Man. It is, however, one of the better Stephen King adaptations-which isn't saying much when you consider how many lousy ones there are out there. A previous, bare bones DVD was released awhile ago. Now, a new special edition with Carpenter's participation is out.A treat for Carpenter fans is the audio commentary by the director and the film's star, Keith Gordon. It's great to hear two directors talk about their craft. . It's a trip down memory lane for both men who joke and remember all sorts of good anecdotes in this relaxed and entertaining track.There are 20 deleted scenes, most of which are not very long in length and, in most cases, were rightly cut. They flesh out the characters a bit more and show the demise of minor characters.""Christine: Fast and Furious"" examines the themes and story of the movie with new interviews with Carpenter, Gordon, John Stockwell and Alexandra Paul.""Christine: Finish Line"" examines the use of music in the movie. Also included in this featurette is how the cast and crew view the film now that twenty years has passed.""Christine: Ignition"" features the film's screenwriter, Bill Phillips, talking about how he adapted King's novel. He and Carpenter talk about the changes that they made from King's novel to make it more cinematic.Christine is good film, not a great one, but definitely one of the better King adaptations because it was made by a director with a distinctive style and vision. In many respects it is not a conventional horror film. There is very little gore or traditional scares. It's more of a mood or an unsettling feeling.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 2]","I'm a Stephen King fan (well, a fan of his early endeavors, at least); and in his heyday John Carpenter could craft an impressive ""Boo"" flick.  Accordingly CHRISTINE is one of those films I always wanted to view, yet over the decades our paths never crossed until recently (thank you, cable).  So I watched this macabre, metaphysical tale about a 1957 Plymouth Fury's demented affection for a high school nerd.  And?Seen better.  Seen worse.No complaints with the scenes depicting the car's violent dysfunction; no telling how many old Plymouths the filmmakers totaled as Christine mangles and mutilates her lover's enemies--and subsequently gets crushed, squished, and burned in her own right.  I'm a guy; watching stuff get torn up is how I roll.  Yet antiques going on rampages do not a horror film make--give me some character development, conflict, angst, turmoil. . .even a character remotely empathetic.  None of the above happened in this film--from nerd-turned-psychotic Arnie (Keith Gordon), to his jockster chum Dennis (John Stockwell), to mutual romantic interest Leigh (Alexandra Paul, whose bizarre facial expressions via close-up still have me scratching my head).  Throw in some high school bullies (who look like they're 3 years away from drawing Social Security) and a gruff garage shop owner, and not one, count 'em, not one character is likable or vaguely identifiable.  So following the climactic Christine vs. Bulldozer grudge match, with the former's rock 'n roll radio going dark, we get the slightest impression the now-compacted '57 Plymouth might be beginning to stir once again.

At school, he's picked on by four thugs, at home he's picked on by his overbearing mother (Christine Belford).  Along the way, he discovers a `magic' car that helps fuel his descent into madness.  It's a wonderful cautionary tale.  Beware how attached you become to a set of wheels.  Varoom-varoom.  Bad car!Actually, as horror films go, this one isn't quite as horror filled as one would hope.  It takes forever before Gordon's character abruptly turns from geek to creep.  Off go the broken glasses and suddenly he's a maniac.  It's quite the change that we never get to see.  A lot of this movie is like that, developments done off screen.  We're just expected to take it on faith that these things happened, no need to see the subtle in between moments leading up to them.  As with the four thugs who take months before deciding to exact their revenge on Arnie, by taking it out on his much beloved automobile Christine.  Or, how (never mind why) the school's new beauty (Alexandra Paul) mysteriously becomes Arnie's girlfriend!I had hoped for more from John Carpenter (I never hope for anything where Stephen King is concerned).  But I can't deny I like this movie anyway.  John Stockwell is likable as Dennis Guilder, Arnie's former best friend.  Robert Prosky is suitably nasty as the owner of the `do it yourself garage.'  Alexandra Paul is miles away from her beach role on Baywatch.  Harry Dean Stanton is sorely wasted as an oblique detective.

18780,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,0767827716,Erik North,"[23, 28]","Stephen King's novels have formed the basis for a great many horror films over the last quarter century.  Some have been superlative (CARRIE, THE SHINING), others just terrible (PET SEMATARY, MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE).  CHRISTINE can be counted among the superlative ones.  Under the expert hands of HALLOWEEN director John Carpenter, this film provides the requisite chills and atmosphere minus a lot of unnecessary blood and gore.Keith Gordon stars as a geeky high school student named Arnie Cunningham who is always getting picked upon by the local school bullies (sound familiar?).  But when he eyes a rusted old 1957 Plymouth Fury, his life really turns around.  Over the objections of his best friend (John Stockwell), he fixes it up at a local garage (run by a salty-tongued Robert Prosky) to a point where the car is as good as new.  Gordon even starts up a relationship with the high school dream queen (Alexandra Paul).  There's just one problem, though.  Christine won't let it go that far.For this '57 Fury is definitely possessed, and pretty soon it takes possession of Gordon.  When the school bullies retaliate against Gordon by trashing Christine, the car repairs itself and goes after the perpetrators one by one.  But the car also reacts in a jealous and homicidal way against Paul, who nearly chokes on a hamburger at a drive-in with Gordon.  And when Paul and Stockwell come to realize that Gordon is indeed totally over the edge, they plot to destroy the car, using a bulldozer inside Prosky's garage.  Unfortunately, Gordon dies in the final melee.  And although Christine itself seems to be crushed to a metal cube, in the tag end scene, a metal piece can be seen repairing itself...Although the setting of the film is changed from King's novel (there, it was western Pennsylvania; in the film, it's southern California), CHRISTINE for the most part stays true to the basic essentials of the book in its depiction of high school bullies and teenage life during 1978-79, which is the era depicted.  There is a certain appropriateness to having Christine's radio play nothing but early rock and roll records, like Little Richard's ""Keep A Knockin'"", and Thurston Harris' ""Little Bitty Pretty One"", while most of the other songs are of the late 70s (""Runaway"" by Bonnie Raitt, ""Bad To The Bone"" by George Thorogood and the Delaware Destroyers).Carpenter makes sure that the emphasis on the movie is on the situations in Gordon's life that lead him to Christine, and how letting his life get totally dominated by that car eventually scares the living daylights out of Stockwell and Paul.  Furthermore, he does this in the same suspenseful fashion that made HALLOWEEN work to such a tee.  His and Alan Howarth's synthesizer-dominated music score lends further atmosphere to the proceedings.

That being said, ""Christine"" is a truly great movie that gets 5 STARS as a thriller, but 0 STARS as a horror movie.  No doubt that Christine was an evil car, but that's just not enough to make this movie scary.  It's difficult for a sophisticated horror movie viewer to become scared of a possessed car and I don't think Carpenter is able to present the car effectively as a force capable of inspiring fear in the audience, but that's no knock on Carpenter as I don't think anyone can pull that off.  However, Carpenter does succeed in creating an evil car and does a great job developing the plot and expressing Christine's evil will. The movie has great acting and a terrific storyline/plot. ""Christine"" is a fun movie to watch and its quite a thriller.  Plus, once again, Carpenter provides us with a great score in this movie as well.Carpenter's ""Christine"" is about an evil car which is actually evil within its metal body, possessed so to speak.  Arnie, played by Keith Gordon, does a terrific job as the nerd in the beginning and possessed person towards the latter part of the movie.  When Arnie spots the car named ""Christine"", he becomes obsessed and ultimately possessed you might say by the 1950's cherry red Plymouth.  Arnie no longer associates with his best friend like he used to and isn't very gentleman like or polite to his girlfriend.Christine absorbs Arnie and doesn't allow him to get too close to anyone but itself.  Ultimately, Christine opens up to Arnie and shows him the power it possesses by actually repairing itself after being trashed by Buddy Reparton and his thugs.  Reparton is a terrific villain who is a school bully that encounters Arnie in the beginning at school and bullies Arnie in one of the funniest scenes in all of modern theatre...it's hilarious!!Anyway, Christine dominates Arnie and his soul to such an extent that his best friend named Dennis and Arnie's ex-girlfriend named Lee are determined to destroy Christine, but that's easier said than done.  This is a great movie by John Carpenter which is very successful as a thriller and comedy but it is a total zero as a horror movie...I'm sure Carpenter would even admit to that much.  As I said, no knock on Carpenter, but it's about impossible to make a horror movie out of a murdering and spiritually possessed car.  In conclusion, I will say this is a very fun movie to watch with a dark side to it...also, I love the score for this movie...the theme music is terrific as is always the case with John Carpenter.",3,"3.99 STARS:  ""..of course, the car came back 3 weeks later.""",1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,2620,"['love', 'movie', 'Christine', 'best', 'not', 'call', 'horror', 'movie', ""n't"", 'qualify', 'such', 'being', 'said', 'Christine', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', '5', 'STARS', 'thriller', '0', 'STARS', 'horror', 'movie', 'No', 'doubt', 'Christine', 'was', 'evil', 'car', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'scary', 'difficult', 'sophisticated', 'horror', 'movie', 'viewer', 'become', 'scared', 'possessed', 'car', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Carpenter', 'able', 'present', 'car', 'effectively', 'force', 'capable', 'inspiring', 'fear', 'audience', 'knock', 'Carpenter', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'However', 'Carpenter', 'succeed', 'creating', 'evil', 'car', 'great', 'job', 'developing', 'plot', 'expressing', 'Christine', 'evil', 'will', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'terrific', 'storyline/plot', 'Christine', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'quite', 'thriller', 'once', 'again', 'Carpenter', 'great', 'score', 'movie', 'well.Carpenter', 'Christine', 'evil', 'car', 'actually', 'evil', 'metal', 'body', 'possessed', 'so', 'speak', 'Arnie', 'played', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'terrific', 'job', 'nerd', 'beginning', 'possessed', 'person', 'latter', 'part', 'movie', 'When', 'Arnie', 'spots', 'car', 'named', 'Christine', 'obsessed', 'ultimately', 'possessed', 'might', 'say', '1950', 'cherry', 'red', 'Plymouth', 'Arnie', 'no', 'longer', 'best', 'friend', 'used', ""n't"", 'very', 'gentleman', 'polite', 'girlfriend.Christine', 'absorbs', 'Arnie', ""n't"", 'allow', 'get', 'too', 'close', 'anyone', 'Ultimately', 'Christine', 'up', 'Arnie', 'power', 'actually', 'repairing', 'being', 'trashed', 'Buddy', 'Reparton', 'thugs', 'Reparton', 'terrific', 'villain', 'who', 'school', 'bully', 'encounters', 'Arnie', 'beginning', 'school', 'bullies', 'Arnie', 'one', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'modern', 'theatre', 'hilarious', 'Anyway', 'Christine', 'Arnie', 'soul', 'extent', 'best', 'friend', 'named', 'Dennis', 'Arnie', 'ex-girlfriend', 'named', 'Lee', 'are', 'determined', 'destroy', 'Christine', 'easier', 'said', 'done', 'great', 'movie', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'very', 'successful', 'thriller', 'comedy', 'total', 'zero', 'horror', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Carpenter', 'would', 'even', 'admit', 'much', 'said', 'knock', 'Carpenter', 'about', 'impossible', 'make', 'horror', 'movie', 'murdering', 'spiritually', 'possessed', 'car', 'conclusion', 'will', 'say', 'very', 'fun', 'movie', 'watch', 'dark', 'side', 'also', 'love', 'score', 'movie', 'theme', 'music', 'terrific', 'always', 'case', 'John', 'Carpenter']",N/A

We can regret the reduced presence of old rock and roll music in the film, as compared to the novel. We can regret the absence of the pregnant theme of Arnold's being haunted by the car to the point of the car getting him away from the crime scene when necessary. Then the ending is a lot less pathetic, poignant and powerful. It is even slightly weak. But the film as a whole is a masterpiece. A masterpiece about these teenagers and their only interests in life, the car and the girl they possess, want to possess or aspire to possess, just like they drink beer, out of spite. But it is always a question of possession. King inverts the direction of this fatal element and the owner is possessed by his own piece of property. The depicting of the possessive and tyrannical parents is superb. The magic of the car is beautiful. The bullies and the way they are treated all along and the way they are reduced to trashing a car and defecating on its dashboard is absolutely pitiless and treats them just the way they should and must be treated: like trash. We find it a good positive thing that these worth-nothing individuals are crashed and crushed and exploded and burnt to death by the car they have dared insult and trash themselves. Vengeance has such a sweet taste to the virginal tongue of a teenager who still thinks his tongue is done to lick ice-cream cones. There is little more to say about it except that it is obvious adults are giving little damn about teenagers. The film only has five adults. The parents who are aggressively possessive. The workshop teacher who is absent when he should not be and then violent when he should have prevented it by being in his place at the right time: that is called duty. Then Darnell who is suspicious, hostile, greedy, rotten and corrupt, and yet impotent in front of such a miracle: a teenager kept on a leash by a magical car. Finally the inspector did not understand anything, or rather, if he understood anything, did not do what he should have done: put Arnie and his car under surveillance, and even the car in custody, not to say in prison. He let the criminal and its accessory free to go on killing. And that was a state cop, from the State of California. That's what I call a respectable body of the security forces of our modern world. Yet I do prefer the book, even if John Carpenter avoided the pink color of the bulldozer which is in the film a pink kaka-eater. Plain yellow is more visually realistic.

Stephen King's novel about the twisted love affair between a boy and his car gets transferred to the screen, courtesy of suspense master John Carpenter. Although lacking some of the more outr&eacute; supernatural elements of the source material, this high-octane cinematic tune-up more than delivers the goods, horror-wise (Christine's midnight rampages will never be forgotten)--as well as being a sly expos&eacute; of the random cruelties within the high-school pecking order. Keith Gordon (who has gone on to become a stellar director in his own right, with films such as A Midnight Clear and Mother Night to his credit) gives a wonderfully controlled central performance.Keith Gordon makes the most of the lead role as the nerdy Arnie who quickly becomes the disturbed owner of ""Christine"". Support cast, including John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul and Harry Dean Stanton have precious little to do, though Robert Prosky does a good job of being gross.Carpenter's atmospheric original score is backed up by a well-chosen collection of rock classics, including George Thorogood's ""Bad to the Bone"" (the titular character's all-too-apt theme song). I don't know if anyone has mentioned this before, but the 50s music was interesting in that most of it came from artists who suffered untimely, tragic deaths....Buddy Holly and Richie Valens of course were killed in a plane crash at the height of their careers...Johnny Ace (""Pledging My Love"") died playing Russian Roulette with a pistol....Larry Williams (""Bony Maronie"") was killed in 1980 by a gunshot wound to the head; he had been involved with drug dealing for years and it was thought to be a gang execution....I think Dion was still alive at the time this movie was made(""I Wonder Why""); I'm not sure about the rest of the Belmonts....",4,Well I be darn another Stephen King adaptation done right,1225324800,"10 30, 2008",2008,1827,"['ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'drive', '55', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'twisted', 'love', 'affair', 'boy', 'car', 'transferred', 'screen', 'courtesy', 'suspense', 'master', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'lacking', 'more', 'outr', 'eacute', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'source', 'material', 'high-octane', 'cinematic', 'tune-up', 'more', 'goods', 'horror-wise', 'Christine', 'midnight', 'rampages', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'sly', 'expos', 'eacute', 'random', 'cruelties', 'high-school', 'pecking', 'order', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'who', 'gone', 'become', 'stellar', 'director', 'own', 'right', 'films', 'such', 'A', 'Midnight', 'Clear', 'Mother', 'Night', 'credit', 'wonderfully', 'controlled', 'central', 'performance.Keith', 'Gordon', 'most', 'lead', 'role', 'nerdy', 'Arnie', 'who', 'quickly', 'disturbed', 'owner', 'Christine', 'Support', 'cast', 'including', 'John', 'Stockwell', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'have', 'precious', 'little', 'do', 'Robert', 'Prosky', 'good', 'job', 'being', 'gross.Carpenter', 'atmospheric', 'original', 'score', 'backed', 'up', 'well-chosen', 'collection', 'rock', 'classics', 'including', 'George', 'Thorogood', 'Bad', 'Bone', 'titular', 'character', 'all-too-apt', 'theme', 'song', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'mentioned', '50s', 'music', 'was', 'interesting', 'most', 'came', 'artists', 'who', 'suffered', 'untimely', 'tragic', 'deaths', '.Buddy', 'Holly', 'Richie', 'Valens', 'course', 'were', 'killed', 'plane', 'crash', 'height', 'careers', 'Johnny', 'Ace', 'Pledging', 'My', 'Love', 'died', 'playing', 'Russian', 'Roulette', 'pistol', '.Larry', 'Williams', 'Bony', 'Maronie', 'was', 'killed', '1980', 'gunshot', 'wound', 'head', 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'drug', 'dealing', 'years', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'gang', 'execution', '.I', 'think', 'Dion', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Wonder', 'Why', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'rest', 'Belmonts']",N/A

Her birthplace was Detroit and she got her first taste of blood when she slammed her hood onto the arm of an auto worker. Another worker gets into the car and flips his cigar ashes onto the seat and they find his dead body in the car as the shift goes home. Don't mess with Christine!Arnie (Keith Gordon) is a real geek, clumsy with black rim glasses and just a nerd. He is just the one the bullies always pick on. Arnie first sees Christine in 1978 while he is riding with his friend Dennis (John Stockwell) after school. He falls madly in love with a rusted pile of junk that he feels is his dream car. The second he see her he wants her and she is in such bad shape that no one in their right mind would buy her. The owner wants $250 for a car that is junk with 93,000 miles on her and a pile of rust.Arnie takes her home and his parents, who are control freaks, throw a fit. Arnie takes the car to a garage where he can rent a spot to work on her and fix her up. He drives the smoking heap of metal into the garage and into a rental stall. Arnie works on the car every chance he gets but his work is in a crazy manner. He puts new windshield wipers on a broken and dirty windshield for example. Arnie is taking old parts out of the junk yard to fix up Christine.Arnie starts changing, he doesn't wear his glasses any more, and he acts, walks and talks different. Trying to find out what is affecting Arnie, Dennis goes and talks to George LeBay who is the man who sold Arnie the car. George LeBay tells Dennis that his brother committed suicide in the car and that his brother's daughter also choked to death in the car. His brother's wife also killed herself in the car. They got rid of the car but it came back by itself, three weeks later......John Carpenter has taken a Stephen King masterpiece and turned it into a killer movie. A car that is a demon and thrives on death and pain is now involved in Arnie's life and the life of Dennis. A love triangle also brings in lovely Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul) and frustration, fear and distrust occurs between best friends. This is a very good movie and the suspense of the movie builds all the way through it. This was a great book that was turned into a great movie.

I had seen it a few years ago when i was 10 or 11.  Somehow i remember it being much better.  But nonetheless, it was great.  I do have a few problems though. Generally i dont mind things being rearranged or changed, but they cut out wayyy too much, and completly changed the ending.  They practically swtiched Roland LeBays role and George Lebays role, but only partically, i was quite confused when i got to that scene.  They also completely cut out the Lebay possession sub-plot, thus changing Arnies character.  I was dissapointed in Micheal cunninghams role in this movie, first off, he didnt look like a thing like i pictured him, and his whole sub-plot with Arnie and Dennis was completely cut, and he only have about 10 lines in the entire movie. The biggest dissapointment for me had to be the cutting of the Dennis/Leigh subplot.  THe ending was changed totally, also a disappointment.However, i do like the rearranging of certain things, it helps the flow of the movie much better, the actors for Arnie and Dennis were perfect, too bad Dennis role was minimized as much as it was.  The effects are AMAZING! even now, i cant imagine them being any better, and this if from way back in 83.  The music is wonderful and perfectly fitting, Regina cunningham is just as i imagined her, her role isnt cut down too much though.

Just some thoughts on this John Carpenter classic...Christine (1983) is about a possessed car that drives itself and is out for revenge.  I know, it sounds silly, but this is a good horror movie.  One thing I want to point out about this movie is the soundtrack.  The music sounds so similar to the soundtrack for Halloween III - Season Of The Witch (1982).  Halloween III wasn't well received when it was released, but has since grown in stature and respect.  Anyway, I've always had the theory that Carpenter wanted to almost recycle the Halloween III soundtrack and use it in a different movie because he might have felt that a great soundtrack like that of Halloween III went to waste due to the movie's poor reception at the time of its release.  So the next best thing was to make an eerily similar (no pun intended) soundtrack to Halloween III and use it in Christine, which came out only a year after Halloween III.  I've also noticed that John Carpenter &#34;best of&#34; movie score compilation CDs don't include anything from the soundtrack of Halloween III, BUT they do include songs from the soundtrack of Christine.  Halloween III flopped in 1982, while Christine was a hit in 1983.  So, that explains it (this is just my opinion, of course).For me, the better movie is Halloween III, and the better soundtrack is Halloween III.  I'm so glad that Halloween III is finally getting the respect it deserves more than three decades after its release.  The Blu-Ray release is awesome.  Check it out if you're a fan of Halloween III.Christine?  A good horror movie that will entertain you.

I occasionally watched it years afterward when it plays on looping cable. Let's just say this is NOT one of Carpenter's best!!!Don't MISinterpret me as a Carpenter-""basher""! He used real creativity in directing two of mi favorite horror/suspense classics, HALLOWEEN & THE FOG. But those were vehicles (pardon the pun) of his own creation, along wi Debra Hill. In the case of CHRISTINE, it looks like someone just gave him a script, said ""here U go, direct this!!!"" & he did so withOUT reading the book or its elements!Thus the movie is a letDOWN compared 2 the book as it CLEARLY WAS MADE 2 appeal to fans of Stephen King! It seems almost lazily cheap to imply that Christine is an ""animal-force"" with a life all her own when in fact (the book) she was nothing more than a conduit for the REAL EVIL villain- her prior-sole hateful & sinister owner: Roland Lebay who projected his rage, fury & menace onto & into the car like a storage battery over his lifetime thus her rampage was really a reflection of HIS rage. But Carpenter transposes those two elements (BIG mistake) 2 make it seem Lebay was just another victim of Christine's.Other weaknesses R the acting which is FLAT & with no real emotion, the actors woodenly reading lines rite out of the book.

18808,A2HIBT2MA2AKIS,0767827716,Joseph,"[8, 11]","Great but mean spirited movie about a teenager who is horribly rejected by his fellow classmates, until the day he discovers Christine a 1958 Plymouth Fury, that just happens to have a mind of its own.  Based upon Stephen  Kings novel of the same name and directed by fellow horror great John  Carpenter, Christine really delivers the goods.  An incredible score, and  great special effects, along with good beliveable acting, and edge of your  seat suspence Christine is a movie with very few flaws if any.  I  personally though that Robert Prosky stood out as the foul mouthed garage  owner Will Darnell, his performance echoes R. Lee Ermy in Full Metal  Jacket.  But the real star of the film is the car itself, using special  effects to highlight the cars rebilding itself is deff. a highlight of the  movie, and why haven't they made some sort of a sequel?  Most of the King  movies that have been made into sequels have been pretty lame, over the  past ten or so years, but I feel that if King and Carpenter could get  togeather again, we would have a story that should continue, due mainly to  the ending of the novel, and the movie as well the story really dosen't  end.  And as a afterthouht!  Ever wonder why the audience wanted to see the  car win?  It was they felt the respect and love shared between Arnie and  Christine!",4,"Great, Great, Great DVD.

Sweet, awkward, bit of a klutz but nothing threatening and nothing wild.Upon passing Christine with its For Sale sign in some stranger's backyard he is infatuated with it for life.Everything he does revolves around it, he changes, he dresses better, and his attitude goes up a few degrees, dates a hot girl and has some bullies who want to bash what he loves the most, his car.The car is an enigma from the beginning. We know it's a machine yet it's like a bad person, you can feel your hair raise on your arm as you watch this movie.

18811,A4GB8I8ACS4PM,0767827716,"Kevin Pepper ""JedeyeNite""","[8, 16]","I normally can't stand it when people write reviews for things they don't own.  I am a collector of limited edition books and movies, so I don't begrudge anyone who lucks up and snatches a copy of a limited edition item.  While I am sad that I missed the boat on grabbing this edition of Christine, I'm not really that upset about it.  Now I would be really upset if I had missed out on some new bonus content, but as it works out, the only thing I'm missing out on is a copy of the movie in high definition.  Oh, but wait.....That's not really true.  I have managed to obtain basically what is included on this disc for $9.99.  Here's how I did it.  First of all, I already own the Special Edition DVD of Christine, which if you don't, you can pick up for anywhere from $5 - $11 on Amazon.  I then signed in to my amazon Instant video on my PS3, and TA DA!!! there was Christine in HD for rent at $3.99 or to purchase for $9.99.  I chose to purchase it, since it will probably be awhile before another HD version of Christine becomes available on disc.  The DVD has ALL of the special features that are listed on the pricey limited one.  Here's where you'll have to make a judgement.  I just popped the DVD in, and the picture is very nice, but does lack some clarity that an HD transfer might have.  I compared the Special Edition DVD picture to that of the HD picture, and there is a little bit of a difference.  The HD picture does look nicer than the DVD in my opinion.  So if you don't own the Special Edition DVD, you can easily get a copy of that, then if you really want the nicest image available, download the HD movie from Amazon instant video.  Combined, you basically have what this limited edition has to offer.  So, bottom line, this is not much of a ""Limited"" Edition after all.P.S.

In every high school there are couple of kids who are treated badly by the tribe. Arnie Cunningham is a sweet, smart kid but the local bullies are making his life hell. He has two things going for him: his imagination and his best friend, Dennis, a genuinely nice kid who is on the football team and protects him.  Arnie finds a Plymouth Fury and falls in love. The car's name is Christine and she's alive. No reason why, she just is. She talks to Arnie telepathicaly and through her radio. When she plays Johnny Ace's Pedging My Love and Arnie sighs and lays his head on her steering wheel the two are irrevocably wedded. The actor's voice changes whenver he's speaking to Christine, it becomes soft and affectionate.  Her music, when they are alone is a playlist of love songs. It's and intense relationship.Arnie gives Christine his life, she gives devotion, protection and  one heck of a makeover. His skin improves and he no longer needs his glassses. He goes from looking like a hopeless geek to a combination of James Dean and Marlon Brando in THe Wild Ones. He attracts and takes for himselt the queen of the school, Leah. The actress playing Leah is not very good. She says her lines and that's about all I can say for her. Frankly, nobody's acting, except for Keith Gordon as Arnie, is very good. Acting is not what makes this movie.  The relationsip, the building suspense that exlodes into terror, the music both soundtrack and John Carpenter's score make the movie and does it fairly well.Christine tolerates Leah for one hot minute but when it looks like Arnie's affection for her is getting too strong the car causes her to almost choke to death. She also settles some scores with the local punks. Anybody who crossed Arnie is getting burnt, squished, crushed and turned into roadkill. Finally Dennis and Leah try to pull Arnie from Christine's spell and end the killing. They succeed, sort of.  Other than the poor acting of the supporting cast, there are a few nitpicks. The leader of the bullies looks about 30, what the heck is he doing in highschool? The ending is too far from what was in the book and is too weak. The detective focuses on Arnie but has nothing to make his investigation legal. This isn't a great movie. It's a darkened basement TV movie and that's okay.

We see a Plymouth Fury rolling down the assembly line in 1957.  Soon something interesting happens that lets you know that there is something special about this car.  Well, special in the Twilight Zone sort of way.  We follow the history of the car in a somewhat abbreviated way, to the point where the car ends up in the hands of Arnie Cunningham.Keith Gordon plays Arnie Cunningham.  Arnie is the kid (kind of like me) that is never cool and often seems to be the one targeted by bullies.  There is something about the beat up red and white 1958 Plymouth Fury that speaks to Arnie.Arnie does have a good friend, Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell).  Dennis is much of what Arnie is not.  He has a cool car and is the star of the high school football team.  However, Arnie's friendship with Dennis does not protect Arnie from high school bully Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander) and his cronies.What happens next is somewhat predictable, but not everything is predictable, unless you know the story.  Arnie names the car Christine and begins working on it.  However, it is soon evident that Christine has the ability to take care of herself, if she has the right human to help her.  As Christine rejuvenates herself, she infuses Arnie with characteristics that may mirror Christine.  One of those characteristics is hatred for those who would disrespect, either Christine or Arnie.  Those who disrespect Christine or Arnie, most especially Christine, are dealt with harshly.  We eventually find out that Christine is a harsh mistress if her partner ""cheats"" on her.There are some very good scenes in this movie.  The whole scene at the gas station was gruesome and good at the same time.  Christine rolling down the highway in flames is a very unique scene.  There are even a couple of scary scenes.  However, the movie in general is not scary so much as it is disturbing in a creepy crawly sort of way.  Those viewers who tend to think too much about a movie could be analyzing this one well into the night, listening for the roar of a Plymouth Fury.",4,"Revenge of the Nerd, Stephen King Style",1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,2249,"['Take', 'one', 'geeky', 'gawky', 'nerd', 'Add', 'one', 'red', 'white', '1958', 'Plymouth', 'Fury', 'what', 'other', 'car', 'name', 'as', 'menacing', 'Fury', 'Mix', 'well', 'Let', 'killing', 'begin.The', 'movie', 'feels', 'eerie', 'beginning', 'see', 'Plymouth', 'Fury', 'rolling', 'down', 'assembly', 'line', '1957', 'Soon', 'something', 'interesting', 'happens', 'know', 'something', 'special', 'car', 'Well', 'special', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'sort', 'way', 'follow', 'history', 'car', 'somewhat', 'abbreviated', 'way', 'point', 'where', 'car', 'up', 'hands', 'Arnie', 'Cunningham.Keith', 'Gordon', 'Arnie', 'Cunningham', 'Arnie', 'kid', 'kind', 'never', 'cool', 'often', 'be', 'one', 'targeted', 'bullies', 'something', 'beat', 'up', 'red', 'white', '1958', 'Plymouth', 'Fury', 'Arnie.Arnie', 'have', 'good', 'friend', 'Dennis', 'Guilder', 'John', 'Stockwell', 'Dennis', 'much', 'what', 'Arnie', 'not', 'cool', 'car', 'star', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'However', 'Arnie', 'friendship', 'Dennis', 'not', 'protect', 'Arnie', 'high', 'school', 'bully', 'Buddy', 'Repperton', 'William', 'Ostrander', 'cronies.What', 'next', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'not', 'everything', 'predictable', 'know', 'story', 'Arnie', 'car', 'Christine', 'working', 'However', 'soon', 'evident', 'Christine', 'ability', 'take', 'care', 'herself', 'right', 'human', 'help', 'Christine', 'Arnie', 'characteristics', 'may', 'mirror', 'Christine', 'One', 'characteristics', 'hatred', 'who', 'would', 'disrespect', 'Christine', 'Arnie', 'who', 'disrespect', 'Christine', 'Arnie', 'most', 'especially', 'Christine', 'are', 'dealt', 'harshly', 'eventually', 'find', 'out', 'Christine', 'harsh', 'mistress', 'partner', 'cheats', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'movie', 'whole', 'scene', 'gas', 'station', 'was', 'gruesome', 'good', 'same', 'time', 'Christine', 'rolling', 'down', 'highway', 'flames', 'very', 'unique', 'scene', 'are', 'even', 'couple', 'scary', 'scenes', 'However', 'movie', 'general', 'not', 'scary', 'so', 'much', 'disturbing', 'creepy', 'crawly', 'sort', 'way', 'viewers', 'who', 'tend', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'analyzing', 'one', 'well', 'night', 'listening', 'roar', 'Plymouth', 'Fury']",N/A

18827,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,0767827716,Michael Butts,"[0, 1]","22 years later, I still have the same problem with this movie that I had upon first seeing it.  The King novel from which CHRISTINE is based was set in a very snowy Pittsburgh; budget constraints compelled the moviemakers to switch the locale to sunny California so that the menacing blizzard which made the book so suspenseful is missing.  Other than that, though, director John Carpenter still manages to scare up some thrills in this tale of a boy and his rather possessive car.  While the reason for the evil car is never clearly explained, one can only surmise that when Christine came off the assembly line, she had tasted blood and therefore has made a habit of taking lives in exchange for her supernatural powers.  Keith Gordon (Dressed to Kill) plays the nerdy Arnie who finds his life drastically changed once he stumbles upon the 1957 Plymouth Fury.  Not only does Christine dish out Carrie-like revenge on Gordon's tormentors, Gordon himself becomes a rather macho man in return.  Ably supported by John Stockwell, Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Prosky and Alexandra Paul, CHRISTINE captures some of the terror of Carpenter's classic HALLOWEEN in exploring terror in rather ""ordinary"" means.

His best friend Dennis, though confined to a hospital room most of the time due to a football accident, is starting to notice the negative change in Arnie also. Soon Dennis and Arnie's girlfriend Leigh team-up to take on the car, but it`ll be no easy task. Christine is determined to keep her love with Arnie intact, and no one gets between Christine and her man.Christine is a great horror classic, despite differences from the book. I'm starting to think I should recommend people stop reading books, since it only seems to give them a bad attitude towards movies if they are even the slightest bit different. You have to take a film completely on its own merit. This is a great film, with fun and exciting scenes. Oh, I doubt it'll give you nightmares or anything, I mean, c'mon, it's a car, though you may develop an even stronger fear of choking. Christine may not be terrifying, but it's tons of fun! From the intense moments when Arnie goes up against his overly controlling parents, to the school jocks pursuit of the high school sweetheart, to the scenes when Christine runs down the school bullies. The entire film is extremely entertaining and well done, and I especially love the way Christine communicates through old 50's rock songs.  Perhaps the only thing I DIDN'T like in the movie was Leigh's line at the end, ""We didn't do so hot."" Ha. It doesn't seem that big a deal now, but listen for it during the end of the movie...it just kinda ruins everything. Ha ha.

Dennis has his back when the school bullies pick a fight early in the film and Dennis gets the best of them.On the way home that day, Artie forces Dennis to stop off at some old man's shack to look at the car he wants to buy.

18842,A1M9DQDGE07Q0U,0767827716,Nix Pix,"[1, 1]","""Christine"" is a high octane horror/thriller about a Plymouth Fury with a mind of her own. Based on Stephen King's best seller, director John Carpenter transforms King's creepy prose into a disturbingly good film. It's amazing how much pure evil personality he gets out of that car. The film stars Keith Gordon as Arnie Cunningham, a bookish high school nobody who's belittled and controlled at home by an over-possessive mother (Christina Belford) and weak paternal figure (Robert Darnell) and taunted at school by the local bully, Buddy Repperton (William Ostrander). Arnie's one salvation is his friendship with jock, Dennis Guilder (John Stockwell) and his burgeoning lust for Leigh Cabot (Alexandra Paul). However, as the film progresses it becomes obvious to all that there's just something a little bit not right about Arnie's devotion to `Christine'. After Arnie buys the run down vehicle and spends every waking moment and dollar to fix her up, Buddy and his gang defile the car during one night of unbridled vandalism. That `Christine' refuses to remain a wreck is the result of her love for Arnie and her all consuming hatred for anyone who gets between them. Watch out - this is one mean automobile. Road and Track has nothing on this babe! John Carpenter's direction is both reserved and slick, teasing the viewer with maniacal pacing that really builds the film's thrills and chills to a magnificent crescendo. In the process he creates a personality for an inanimate object that is absolutely terrifying and believable on the screen.Columbia Tristar made ""Christine"" previously available on DVD. This new special edition represents the exact same video and audio quality as its predecessor, adding three new and informative featurettes, an audio commentary by Carpenter and a theatrical trailer to the mix. The add on's are worth a repurchase. As for the film itself; the anamorphic transfer is remarkably smooth with bright, vivid colors, nicely rendered fine detail and very rich and solid blacks. There's very little in the way of either edge enhancement or pixelization for a generally smooth visual quality. Occasionally there is a hint of film grain but this is not distracting.

18843,A363QRXP83K8ZE,0767827716,"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[0, 0]","Christine, John Carpenter's version of the Stephen King book, doesn't add up despite some great elements.  But after having read the novel I don't think there was much else he could do.This movie has at least one or two unforgettable scenes centering around the 58 Plymouth Fury.  Carpenter takes an (almost) everyday object (it IS a classic) and injects it with pure menace.The source novel was a lengthy affair that personally never impressed me despite a great effort by King.  The novel, despite King taking his time, just never grabbed me, and in the end it came off as just...silly.  The car was evil simply because the guy who bought was just such a [jerk] and was just ""evil"".  That extra dimension doesn't really make its way into the film, despite a great little bit by Roberts Blossom as LeBey.The film, instead, opens with Bad to the Bone on the soundtrack (before that song was beaten sour rotten to death in film and TV) as Christine rolls off a Detroit assembly line.  Because we SEE the car--photographed beautifully--we can attach the underlying menace of the book to something striking on screen.The principles are all good here.  Keith Gordon as Arnie Cunningham has the nerd-with-taped-up-glasses bit down perfect.  (What's with the black leather vest later?)  His friend, played by John Stockwell (who, like Gordon, also directs films now) is Arnie's slightly doofey friend is believable enough as the high school jock.  And a future Baywatch gal plays the chief female.The music is by Carpenter, too, and while not as strong as his other efforts, provides at least one or two really creepy passages with great synths.The film feels too short, too rushed.  The novel goes on and on and establishes strong characters and background story.  The film relies heavily on a few great set pieces featuring Christine's bloody night drives.

18845,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,0767827716,Paperbackstash,"[1, 1]","It's ironic Stephen King was hit by a van a few years back (because the woman was distracted by her St. Bernard no less) since he seems to enjoy sneaking vehicles into his movies. In Cujo two people are trapped in a car that got them in the situation in the first place by breaking down. In Pet Semetary a devestating death takes place because of a large semi. In Sometimes they Come back, the situation could have been prevented if it wasn't for not finding car keys to get out of the way of the train. And then there's the more direct approaches...Trucks, Maximum Overdrive, and finally...Christine.Adapted to the screen by one of the most impressive directors alive, John Carpenter, this picture circles around the plot of a posessed, obsessive, vindictive Female 58 Plymouth named Christine. Christine herself has definite personality and comes across as convincingly alive.Arnie (Keith Gordon), a socially inept teenage boy with parents you just want to slap and one friend, finds his dream in an old run down automobile at an old man's house. Paying no mind the cars condition, he promptly buys the hunk of evil metal and proceeds to put everything he's worth into it. Dennis (John Stockwell) plays Arnie's best friend John, who never quite feels right about Christine and is slowly isolated from Arnie as his personality completely alters. The other main role is Leigh (Alexandra Paul) who was briefly Annie's girl and comes out as one of the only female competitors of Christine that lives. So far.Arnie gets a job at a car shop to work on Christine, and builds her up to almost brand new. He's having trouble with some bullies at school though, and they take their revenge out on his most prized posession. He and Christine start plotting on how to get even.The movie doesn't have blood or gore, really, and the scare factor is missing, but it's still entertaining. After Leigh becomes increasingly jealous of the time Arnie spends on his car, she sees Christines dark side real fast and the two lovebirds break it off. Her and Dennis get together to discuss the fears they have about their friend and through research on the car's history, come to a conclusion that I won't spoil.Carpenters slick visuals are all there and I saw some brilliant direction (especially the scene where Arnie stands in front of the car and asks to see what she's got) but like King himself, I found this movie a little lackluster. Arnie's change is almost overnight, a tad too quick for plausibility. A car can only get so creative in the way it slaughters once it's gone wacko so that's gets a little old.In the end, the theme of killers cars isn't really my cup of tea, but hey, this flick's not boring and has realistic characters. All act well and are explored deeply enough to be cared about. Great music accompanies the highlights, and some superb suspenseful bits are woven in through Carpenter's camera magic.",4,Fun!,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,2906,"['ironic', 'Stephen', 'King', 'was', 'hit', 'van', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'woman', 'was', 'distracted', 'St.', 'Bernard', 'less', 'enjoy', 'sneaking', 'vehicles', 'movies', 'Cujo', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'trapped', 'car', 'got', 'situation', 'first', 'place', 'breaking', 'down', 'Pet', 'Semetary', 'devestating', 'death', 'place', 'large', 'semi', 'Sometimes', 'Come', 'back', 'situation', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'prevented', 'was', ""n't"", 'not', 'finding', 'car', 'keys', 'get', 'way', 'train', 'then', 'more', 'direct', 'approaches', 'Trucks', 'Maximum', 'Overdrive', 'finally', 'Christine.Adapted', 'screen', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'directors', 'alive', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'picture', 'plot', 'posessed', 'obsessive', 'vindictive', 'Female', '58', 'Plymouth', 'named', 'Christine', 'Christine', 'definite', 'personality', 'across', 'convincingly', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'socially', 'inept', 'teenage', 'boy', 'parents', 'just', 'want', 'slap', 'one', 'friend', 'dream', 'old', 'run', 'down', 'automobile', 'old', 'man', 'house', 'Paying', 'mind', 'cars', 'condition', 'promptly', 'hunk', 'evil', 'metal', 'proceeds', 'put', 'everything', 'worth', 'Dennis', 'John', 'Stockwell', 'Arnie', 'best', 'friend', 'John', 'who', 'never', 'quite', 'feels', 'right', 'Christine', 'slowly', 'isolated', 'Arnie', 'personality', 'completely', 'alters', 'other', 'main', 'role', 'Leigh', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'who', 'was', 'briefly', 'Annie', 'girl', 'out', 'one', 'only', 'female', 'competitors', 'Christine', 'So', 'far.Arnie', 'job', 'car', 'shop', 'work', 'Christine', 'up', 'almost', 'brand', 'new', 'having', 'trouble', 'bullies', 'school', 'take', 'revenge', 'out', 'most', 'prized', 'posession', 'Christine', 'start', 'plotting', 'how', 'get', 'even.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'blood', 'gore', 'really', 'scare', 'factor', 'missing', 'still', 'entertaining', 'Leigh', 'increasingly', 'jealous', 'time', 'Arnie', 'car', 'Christines', 'dark', 'side', 'real', 'fast', 'two', 'lovebirds', 'off', 'Dennis', 'get', 'together', 'discuss', 'fears', 'have', 'friend', 'research', 'car', 'history', 'come', 'conclusion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil.Carpenters', 'slick', 'visuals', 'are', 'saw', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'especially', 'scene', 'where', 'Arnie', 'front', 'car', 'see', 'what', 'got', 'King', 'found', 'movie', 'little', 'lackluster', 'Arnie', 'change', 'almost', 'overnight', 'tad', 'too', 'quick', 'plausibility', 'car', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'so', 'creative', 'way', 'gone', 'wacko', 'little', 'end', 'theme', 'killers', 'cars', ""n't"", 'really', 'cup', 'tea', 'hey', 'flick', 'not', 'boring', 'realistic', 'characters', 'act', 'well', 'are', 'explored', 'deeply', 'enough', 'be', 'cared', 'Great', 'music', 'highlights', 'superb', 'suspenseful', 'bits', 'are', 'woven', 'Carpenter', 'camera', 'magic']",N/A

18852,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,0767827716,Robert J. Schneider,"[0, 0]","John Carpenter's CHRISTINE (1983) is teenage horror/suspense in the fine tradition of CARRIE. Like the aforementioned (and superior) classic, it involves an introverted teenage outcast who is ruled by an iron fist at home, is bullied endlessly by mean-spirited jerks, and destroys them with supernatural powers that are understood only by the protagonist. In that same tradition, however, our hero loses control over her/his powers and is eventually destroyed by them. That's the basic formula in a nutshell. However, before you can shout, &quot;Ripoff!&quot; let it be known that CHRISTINE gives us a unique treatment of the same basic theme, and ends up being a complete story that is unique, well-paced and suspenseful in its own right. Plus, it also has terrific acting.Keith Gordon, as the nerdy Arnie Cunningham whose personality is transformed by the titular red 1958 Plymouth Fury that he buys in order to help win the attention of Leigh Cabot (the winsome Alexandra Paul), is brilliant and spellbinding in his portrayal of this very fragile character. His slow but steady descent into revenge, cruelty and madness is especially intriguing; he goes from being a very sympathetic character in the first half of the film to a complete raging sociopath by its end. Psychologically, his transition from shy doormat to dangerous monster is perhaps even more frightening than Carrie White's parallel metamorphosis; Carrie lost everybody who was--or whom she thought was--on her side, but Arnie ends up losing his soul.In addition to Keith Gordon's terrific performance, we have John Stockwell as Arnie's best friend Dennis, who unsuccessfully tries to keep Arnie from going off the deep end.  Also in a memorable supporting role is the venerable Robert Prosky, going totally against type to play the grouchy, scruffy, foulmouthed auto-body shop owner Will Darnell.  Although the wonderful veteran character actor Harry Dean Stanton appears in this film, he is very much wasted in the thankless role of Detective Rudolph Junkins, whose only function is to show up every once in a while to ask Arnie some suspicious questions after someone gets offed. (It is of note that the future Mrs. John Travolta herself, Kelly Preston, has a bit part as well.)CHRISTINE may not be the best Horror film ever made, but I do think that it's one of the best.  The story is extremely interesting and really hooks you from the first scene onwards.  In addition to the acting, the editing is first-rate; indeed, it is so good that the premise of a possessed and evil car actually looks believable!  Then there is the music: 50's Rock 'N' Roll makes up the most of the soundtrack, although George Thorogood's early-80's classic &quot;Bad To The Bone&quot; is used to good effect.  The car's radio is practically a character-within-a-character, and is used so effectively that the first sound of it inspires a real sense of danger.  Of course, John Carpenter has to be fully commended for a great job in bringing Stephen King's vision to life on the screen.RECOMMENDEDHIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR HORROR FANS",4,Keith Gordon + Killer Car + John Carpenter = Horror Classic,1079568000,"03 18, 2004",2004,3083,"['John', 'Carpenter', 'CHRISTINE', '1983', 'teenage', 'horror/suspense', 'fine', 'tradition', 'CARRIE', 'aforementioned', 'superior', 'classic', 'introverted', 'teenage', 'outcast', 'who', 'ruled', 'iron', 'fist', 'home', 'bullied', 'endlessly', 'mean-spirited', 'jerks', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'are', 'understood', 'only', 'protagonist', 'same', 'tradition', 'however', 'hero', 'control', 'her/his', 'powers', 'eventually', 'destroyed', 'basic', 'formula', 'nutshell', 'However', 'can', 'shout', 'quot', 'Ripoff', 'quot', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'CHRISTINE', 'unique', 'treatment', 'same', 'basic', 'theme', 'up', 'being', 'complete', 'story', 'unique', 'well-paced', 'suspenseful', 'own', 'right', 'also', 'terrific', 'acting.Keith', 'Gordon', 'nerdy', 'Arnie', 'Cunningham', 'personality', 'transformed', 'titular', 'red', '1958', 'Plymouth', 'Fury', 'order', 'help', 'win', 'attention', 'Leigh', 'Cabot', 'winsome', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'brilliant', 'spellbinding', 'portrayal', 'very', 'fragile', 'character', 'slow', 'steady', 'descent', 'revenge', 'cruelty', 'madness', 'especially', 'intriguing', 'being', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'complete', 'raging', 'sociopath', 'end', 'Psychologically', 'transition', 'shy', 'doormat', 'dangerous', 'monster', 'perhaps', 'even', 'more', 'frightening', 'Carrie', 'White', 'parallel', 'metamorphosis', 'Carrie', 'lost', 'everybody', 'who', 'was', 'whom', 'thought', 'was', 'side', 'Arnie', 'up', 'losing', 'soul.In', 'addition', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'terrific', 'performance', 'have', 'John', 'Stockwell', 'Arnie', 'best', 'friend', 'Dennis', 'who', 'unsuccessfully', 'keep', 'Arnie', 'going', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'Also', 'memorable', 'supporting', 'role', 'venerable', 'Robert', 'Prosky', 'going', 'totally', 'type', 'play', 'grouchy', 'scruffy', 'foulmouthed', 'auto-body', 'shop', 'owner', 'Will', 'Darnell', 'wonderful', 'veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'wasted', 'thankless', 'role', 'Detective', 'Rudolph', 'Junkins', 'only', 'function', 'show', 'up', 'once', 'while', 'ask', 'Arnie', 'suspicious', 'questions', 'someone', 'offed', 'note', 'future', 'Mrs.', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'bit', 'part', 'well', 'CHRISTINE', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'Horror', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'do', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'story', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'really', 'hooks', 'first', 'scene', 'onwards', 'addition', 'acting', 'editing', 'first-rate', 'indeed', 'so', 'good', 'premise', 'possessed', 'evil', 'car', 'actually', 'believable', 'Then', 'music', '50', 'Rock', 'N', 'Roll', 'up', 'most', 'soundtrack', 'George', 'Thorogood', 'early-80', 'classic', 'quot', 'Bad', 'Bone', 'quot', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'car', 'radio', 'practically', 'character-within-a-character', 'used', 'so', 'effectively', 'first', 'sound', 'real', 'sense', 'danger', 'course', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'be', 'fully', 'commended', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'Stephen', 'King', 'vision', 'life', 'screen.RECOMMENDEDHIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED', 'FOR', 'HORROR', 'FANS']",N/A

(You know, $29.99 plus shipping, plus tax, etc, etc) No stinkin' movie is worth thirty bucks. A few days later, it was said to be sold out. But then, a few months later, I saw that someone was selling it on Ebay starting at $30 for bidding, So, I figured, what the heck. If I get it for about $35, I'll only grumble for a day.Well, as the deadline was approaching to make the highest bid, and that there were only 2 bidders locked in on this purchase, I entered $50.02 just for the heck of it thinking nobody's going to bid any higher. I hoped to God that I wouldn't have to actually pay $50 for this not-so-fabulous film, but low and behold, I was the winner at just under $46. Five additional bids popped in like at the last two minutes of the deadline. At first, I felt a small victory for winning the purchase, but then, I sure felt stupid that I got stuck paying a whole freakin' $46 for it.And even after I watched it, I felt even more taken advantaged of by bidding for and buying this one single movie on Blu-ray for $46.  The transfer isn't anything much better than the DVD. Some scenes were sharper, but most of the film you wouldn't really see much of an improvement. You can see that some people are already selling their bought copy used for about $70 bucks. That should tell you right there that the Blu-ray release of this film is nothing too impressive to replace your DVD with.

A DUNN,"[2, 3]","Ever since ""The Love Bug,"" people have been fascinated with wonder on the possibility that perhaps all the love and attention they give to their cars could be reciprocated by their cars!  ""Herbie"" was the underdog Love Bug.  Christine however is the jealous bitch-car!In my early 20's I-like many other young men-found and restored my own special ""Love-Car""- a 1968 AMC Javelin, painted the same colors as Christine!  My customized licence plates told the story of my obsession and love for that car for all to see!  ""HOLY J""  :)  But however, the ""Holy J"" was after all, just a car to party in with the gang and wreck all the time. In the end, 'Holy J' meant to me that I ""resurrected"" the car dozens of times after the results of drunken road trips!  It never had a vengeful bolt on it's chassis, as Christine did!Take a classic nerd.  Add the rusted wreck of a 1958 Plymouth Belvedere. (That was a Beledere, not a Fury.)  A gorgeous Belvedere with an attitude!  What do you end up with?  A lot of magic.  A lot of unswerving devotion. A lot of vengeance!  And a lot of guts in more ways than one!  And unlike my Javelin, Christine had the ability and talent to FIX HERSELF after being trashed by hoods, and after trashing herself in her many murderous sprees in revenge of those who f(ool)ed with her!I read the book after seeing the movie long ago.  I was disappointed in the book, it got boring in many places, whereas the movie stuck to the main star, Christine!  There was no need to show rotting corpses in the back seat to convey the sheer EVIL under her hood!My favorite scene:  After Arnie's girl chokes on the hamburger in Christine, he drives her home.  Upon returning to the car, Christine won't start.  Arnie tries to sweettalk Christine to no avail!  Only when Arnie tells Christine that nothing has changed in THEIR love affair does Christine respond with a deep motor roll, and the radio plays ""I wonder why I love you like I do!""  And Arnie smiles the most chilling adoration smile you ever seen!  Its the smile a teen has after his first sexual encounter!  That smile alone speaks volumes!I would love to see a 2007 remake of Christine!  Call it Christine-Resurrection.  Show the cube of crushed metal of the old Christine melted into a ceiling beam in a factory that collapses, killing dozens. Then show the twisted girder once again melted down and sent to Detroit to form the body of the new Christine:  A gorgeous 2006 Chrysler 300C Touring Sedan...WITH A VENGEANCE!

18864,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,0767827716,S. Rhodes,"[0, 0]","John Carpenter's ""Christine"".  Based upon the novel by Stephen King.  The good news is, this isn't a ""bad"" adaptation.  That shouldn't suggest its a good one either.  Anyone who has read the book can tell you the movie jumbled a lot of things around.  But you can't expect a movie adaptation to be perfect.  For that, I graded this loosely.Keith Gordon plays Arnie Cunningham.  A student who's commonly picked on, and tries (too hard at times) to be popular and fit in with the crowd.  John Stockton plays his best friend, Dennis Guilder, who sticks with Arnie through all the good and the bad.When Dennis is busy taking Arnie for a ride home, Arnie spots a busted down 1958 Plymouth in a horrible looking yard.  This soon becomes the biggest obsession with his life.  The cars name is Christine.  To us, she's just a normal car.  To Arnie, she's his lover.  But the reality of it: She's a demon on wheels.The movie starts off fine at first.  The way the characters are portrayed in the movie is disturbingly good.  The casting was great too.  I'm impressed with how people got into their rolls, and how the movie played out because of it.  It made watching it better, at least.  Arnie, I felt, was a little overdone in the beginning.  He looks almost too nerdish.  So nerdish that when he begins to cuss at his parents, it almost looks completely out of character for him.  But as the movie drags on (and he later loses the glasses) his character becomes deeper, and better.The problem I had with this film was the pace.  It doesn't move too slow, it rather moves too fast.  When Arnie first gets the car, everything is fine and dandy.  Then, as he becomes obsessed with his car, he changes.  The problem is, we know he's changed, but we didn't get to see him undergo that change long enough.  You had to adapt to the fact that he had changed before we even realized he had changed.The music was nice, but the death scenes weren't up to par with how gruesome they were in the book.  The book was much more exhilerating and heart pounding.Lastly, the movie just wasn't scary.  There's too much build up to the point where one can't be frightened.  The important parts it zips through so fast that there's no suspense build up.  In fact, the only surprise is near the end of the movie.  Sadly, it's only a surprise because it's so incredibly different from the book.  ""The Shining"" was scary, even if you read the book.  ""Carrie"" was scary, even if you read the book.""Christine"" is not scary in the slightest.  It tries so hard to be but it really isn't.  Fine performances, fine characters.

18867,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,0767827716,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[4, 5]",I'm not a real ardent Stephen King fan but have read most of his hugely entertaining  early novels (those published in the 70's and early 80's) and I consider CHRISTINE to be one of his best.  I came across the film version the other day and didn't really mean to watch for more than a few minutes but I was riveted from the opening scenes at a Detroit auto factory in the 1950's where Christine is manufactured to the unsettling final scene. The movie had to condense and combine a lot of material from the book but still remains relatively faithful to King's original plot.  In fact I picked up a copy of the novel again and really enjoyed using it to fill in some of the details the film merely hinted at.  One minor complaint is that the novel CHRISTINE took place in the Pittsburgh suburbs and director John Carpenter changed the movie location to California where it was obviously filmed. The acting from the mostly young and still not particularly well known cast is OK but nothing special.

18868,A26A8T38C2GQD7,0767827716,Taheen Lopez,"[0, 0]","CHRISTINE is a Stephen King novel based John Carpenter flick about an eerie, twisted love story of a teenager and his obsessively jealous 1958 Plymouth Fury --- as only Stephen King can tell it! Christine is a red and white 1958 Plymouth Fury who seduces 17-year-old Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon).She demands his complete and unquestioned devotion and when outsiders seek to interfere, they become the victims of Christine's horrifying wrath. This special edition DVD is packed with added features.As Arnie begins to restore the evil Christine to her original beauty, Christine only played old songs from the 1950's Rock & Roll music expressing its feelings towards Arnie & anybody who tampered with her, especially after the car expresses to Arnie that his feelings of admiration for Christine are requited causing Arnie to have a change in behavior & personality bringing out his dark side when he starts spending most of his time with the car.In addition to that, King's novel which was the source for Carpenter's film clearly indicated that the car was possessed by the evil spirit of it's previous owner Roland LeBay showing that the evil spirit surrounding the car was already present the day it was built at the car factory in Detroit along with the fact that Carpenter had decided to make a car the killer & the villain in CHRISTINE instead of having serial killers or mass murderers being the villains like Carpenter did with his horror flicks HALLOWEEN in the Fall of 1978 and THE FOG in the Winter of 1980.As a matter of fact, Carpenter even explains in this DVD's bonus feature how reading King's story of CHRISTINE inspired him to direct this movie, especially since his previous flick THE THING did so poorly at the box office when it was theatrically released in the Summer of 1982.Although Christine was identified as a 1958 Plymouth Fury, they also used 2 other Plymouth models like the Belvedere & the Savoy to portray the malevolent automobile onscreen kind of like how they used 4 Pontiac Trans Ams to run the show on KNIGHT RIDER during its 1982-86 run on NBC and like the producers did with the General Lee on THE DUKES OF HAZZARD during its 1979-85 run on CBS, especially since the '58 Fury's were expensive to buy at the time costing the producers of CHRISTINE a total production of $5,303 bucks.Kevin Bacon was originally offered the role of Arnie Cunningham, but he declined it to do a screen test for the movie FOOTLOOSE, which was a risky move for Bacon at the time, but ended up paying off at the end since FOOTLOOSE was a major success at the box office when it was released in the Winter of 1984.CHRISTINE amassed $3,408,904 landing at #4 during its opening weekend release back in the Fall of 1983 bringing in a total gross of $21,017,849 at the box office. This thriller also had a returning co-star from a previous John Carpenter film too which was Harry Dean Stanton(Det. Rudolph Junkins)which played Brain in ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK which was theatrically releases in the Summer of 1981.This thriller also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 11 years old in the 5th grade living in my hometown(El Centro,CA)at the time.",4,"From the director of Halloween, The Fog, Escape From New York, and The Thing",1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,3161,"['CHRISTINE', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'based', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'flick', 'eerie', 'twisted', 'story', 'teenager', 'obsessively', 'jealous', '1958', 'Plymouth', 'Fury', 'only', 'Stephen', 'King', 'can', 'tell', 'Christine', 'red', 'white', '1958', 'Plymouth', 'Fury', 'who', '17-year-old', 'Arnie', 'Cunningham', 'Keith', 'Gordon', '.She', 'complete', 'unquestioned', 'devotion', 'when', 'outsiders', 'seek', 'interfere', 'become', 'victims', 'Christine', 'horrifying', 'wrath', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'packed', 'added', 'features.As', 'Arnie', 'restore', 'evil', 'Christine', 'original', 'beauty', 'Christine', 'only', 'played', 'old', 'songs', '1950', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'music', 'expressing', 'feelings', 'Arnie', 'anybody', 'who', 'tampered', 'especially', 'car', 'Arnie', 'feelings', 'admiration', 'Christine', 'are', 'requited', 'causing', 'Arnie', 'have', 'change', 'behavior', 'personality', 'bringing', 'out', 'dark', 'side', 'when', 'spending', 'most', 'time', 'car.In', 'addition', 'King', 'novel', 'was', 'source', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'clearly', 'indicated', 'car', 'was', 'possessed', 'evil', 'spirit', 'previous', 'owner', 'Roland', 'LeBay', 'showing', 'evil', 'spirit', 'surrounding', 'car', 'was', 'already', 'present', 'day', 'was', 'built', 'car', 'factory', 'Detroit', 'fact', 'Carpenter', 'had', 'decided', 'make', 'car', 'killer', 'villain', 'CHRISTINE', 'instead', 'having', 'serial', 'killers', 'mass', 'murderers', 'being', 'villains', 'Carpenter', 'did', 'horror', 'flicks', 'HALLOWEEN', 'Fall', '1978', 'THE', 'FOG', 'Winter', '1980.As', 'matter', 'fact', 'Carpenter', 'even', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'feature', 'how', 'reading', 'King', 'story', 'CHRISTINE', 'inspired', 'direct', 'movie', 'especially', 'previous', 'flick', 'THE', 'THING', 'did', 'so', 'poorly', 'box', 'office', 'when', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'Summer', '1982.Although', 'Christine', 'was', 'identified', '1958', 'Plymouth', 'Fury', 'also', 'used', '2', 'other', 'Plymouth', 'models', 'Belvedere', 'Savoy', 'portray', 'malevolent', 'automobile', 'onscreen', 'kind', 'how', 'used', '4', 'Pontiac', 'Trans', 'Ams', 'run', 'show', 'KNIGHT', 'RIDER', '1982-86', 'run', 'NBC', 'producers', 'did', 'General', 'Lee', 'THE', 'DUKES', 'OF', 'HAZZARD', '1979-85', 'run', 'CBS', 'especially', ""'58"", 'Fury', 'were', 'expensive', 'buy', 'time', 'costing', 'producers', 'CHRISTINE', 'total', 'production', '5,303', 'bucks.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'was', 'originally', 'offered', 'role', 'Arnie', 'Cunningham', 'declined', 'do', 'screen', 'test', 'movie', 'FOOTLOOSE', 'was', 'risky', 'move', 'Bacon', 'time', 'ended', 'up', 'paying', 'off', 'end', 'FOOTLOOSE', 'was', 'major', 'success', 'box', 'office', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'Winter', '1984.CHRISTINE', 'amassed', '3,408,904', 'landing', '4', 'opening', 'weekend', 'release', 'back', 'Fall', '1983', 'bringing', 'total', 'gross', '21,017,849', 'box', 'office', 'thriller', 'also', 'had', 'returning', 'co-star', 'previous', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'too', 'was', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Det', 'Rudolph', 'Junkins', 'played', 'Brain', 'ESCAPE', 'FROM', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'was', 'theatrically', 'Summer', '1981.This', 'thriller', 'also', 'back', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'was', '11', 'years', 'old', '5th', 'grade', 'living', 'hometown', 'El', 'Centro', 'CA', 'time']",N/A

The film centers around a demonically possessed 1958 Plymouth Fury with a strange history--the workers who completed the construction of the car were mysteriously killed and the initial owner of the vehicle took his own life after his wife suddenly died.Keith Gordon stars as Archie Cunningham, a classic geek in high school who wears nerdy frames and eats packed yogurt for lunch.  He is the butt of many jokes, but jock star Ryan Stockwell is still his best buddy.  After school one day, Archie comes across Christine, the devilish car.  He fixes her up and proceeds to become obsessed by her.  A new-found confidence prompts Arnie to ask the cutest girl in the school (Alexandra Paul) out for a date and they quickly fall in love--but Christine does not approve.  The car demands Arnie's complete and unquestioned devotion and when outsiders seek to interfere, they become the victim's of Christine's horrifying wrath.A superb performance from Gordon in the lead role, transforming himself from a laughing stock class dork to an arrogant, obscene maniac who gets so comsumed with Christine that will be anything to preserve the safety of the car.  Excellent script from Bill Phillips, unraveling the King masterpiece with a quick deliberance that keeps the audience on the edge of their toes and waiting for Christine's next move.  Outstanding direction and musical score creation by Carpenter, using specific lighting arrangements and camera angles to add to the suspense, all the while producing a terrifying musical accompanyment.  Even though it is not overly terryfying with sudden jolts of scares, ""Christine"" is horror/suspense at its very best and a hidden gem of the thriller genre.

Arnie even has white tape holding his coke-bottled eyeglass frames together.  One day Arnie and his best fried, Jock Dennis (John Stockwell) visit a junkyard where they find an old, junky 1958 Plymouth fury.  Arnie has to have the car and buys it from the old junk dealer played by Roberts blossom who you may recall as the old man who lived next door to Macauley Caulkin in ""Home Alone"".Arnie's parents are NOT happy he bought the car and forbid them to keep the car at the house so he takes it to a do-it-yourself garage run by the great character actor Robert Prosky.  As Arnie begins to restore the car something begins to happen to him.  He begins to gain confidence.  He no longer allows his parents to bully him, he no longer wears his glasses and he's gone after the hot girl in school Leigh played by Alexandra Paul.  As his obsession with his car grows, Arnie begins pushing his girl and only friend away as his own sanity begins to teeter.  When the bullies break into the garage and vandalize the car...look out!  This car wants revenge and intends to get it wheter Arnie is along for the ride or not.  It all leads to a climatic showdown as Christine will not allow anyone to come between Arnie and herself.is the car haunted?  Demon posessed?  Who knows.  But it is a wonderful psychological horror as we see Arnie transform from mild-mannered geek to the obsessed murderer.

So when Arnie finds the perfect car that he can rebuild and put his love into, the car nicknamed ""Christine"" by its former deceased owner more than returns that love--she gives Arnie a thug makeover and turns him into a monster as bad as the the kids that used to beat Arnie up. Needless to say, Christine has some special abilities of her own and she becomes--so to speak--the vehicle for Archie's revenge and vice versa.Dennis tries to intervene but once Arnie becomes possessed by Christine, he and Arnie's new girlfriend Leigh (the lovely Alexandra Paul in her first film role)are unable to reach him. A local police detective (Harry Dean Stanton)becomes suspcious but isn't able to prove that Arnie had anything to do with a mounting body count consisting of high school students from Arnie's school.The beautiful transfer here manages to skip many of the flaws that have become a Columbia Tristar trademark; the edge enhancement is minimal and the sharp, detailed picture has vivid rich color recalling the original look of the theatrical cut of the film. The high definition transfer is as sharp as a rebuild car after a top notch paint job.Duplicating the wonderful format that director John Carpenter has used on ""The Thing"", ""Big Trouble in Little China"" and ""Escape from New York"", the audio commentary features both the director and star Keith Gordon (now a director himself) discussing the nuts and bolts of making the film. Gordon provides a unique perspective as both the film's star and also an acclaimed director of small, independent films.While I also like King's books, I'd like to point out that to make a feature film of a novel would take (as writer Bill Phillips astutely points out in the special features section)20 hours or more so novels have to be streamlined in the hopes of capturing the feel of the film. It's hoped that the visul style brought to the film will make up for the narrative threads that are lost and Carpenter's film does just that. While LeFey the previous owner of Christine played a major role in the book, it seemed as if he was the one driving the action. Carpenter and Phillips decided that Christine was just born bad and that evil spilled out to possess their owners as well. I found Carpenter and Phillips choices in turning the novel into a film to be very good ones.Laurent Bouzereau's three excellent featurettes focus on the conception of the film all the way through the production and release. Oddly enough, though, Columbia has them listed out of order under the special features section starting with ""Christine Fast & Furious"", ""Christine Finish Line"" and ""Christine Ignition"" presented in that order. You should really watch the last one first, the first one second and the second one last. Of course, you can click on them in any order (they play individually)but it does seem a curious choice to present them this way. We also get 20 deleted/alternate scenes that provide an interesting addition to the original film. While Carpenter wisely chose to cut some of them, a small portion of the deleted scenes would have made a great addition to a ""Director's Cut"" of this film. Since Carpenter is technically ""retired"" (as he jokingly points out in his commentary), he certainly could spent the time to reintegrate key scenes. Unfortunately, it's doubtful that this special edition had the budget for such an undertaking. Regardless, I'm happy that Columbia Tristar elected to put out this special edition in the first place.We also get the usual Columbia Tristar previews as well. This special edition provides a classic Carpenter film a second change on DVD. While the film was critically well received (Time called it ""Carpenter's best film since 'Halloween')for the most part (many criticized the foul language. Writer Bill Phillips discusses how Columbia's executives asked him to add more foul language so the film could earn a hard ""R"" rating. He laughes as he recalls that ""Scarface"" would soon replace ""Christine"" with the most foul lanugage in a two hour movie), it only did fair box office business. It's nice to see this classic bit of Carpenter-King-Phillips entertainment finally the way it should be presented.",4,A possessed car becomes a vehicle of revenge for teen,1094256000,"09 4,

18880,A2USTECHX1PKVA,0767827716,"Weedwacker ""I'm a doctor of STEW.""","[1, 2]","Keith Gordon gives a truly creepy performance as Arnie Cunningham, a geeky, intelligent, 17-yr-old outcast who is bullied constantly, seems to have no luck whatsoever with the ladies, or with anything else, really.  He has only one friend in the world, Dennis Gilder, a popular, good-looking football player, played far less convincingly by John Stockwell.Arnie falls in love with an incredibly dilapidated '58 Plymouth Fury.  His feelings for the car are beyond those of which he has ever felt for any human being...and the intense feelings are mutual.  The love turns into an obsession and doom for anyone who tries to interfere.While Christine is one of my favorite horror movies it falls just shy of being truly horrific and scary, like most John Carpenter films, in my opinion.  But thanks to Keith Gordon it most definitely leaves you with a very uneasy feeling and it manages to get under your skin a bit.  Usually Gordon's self-pitying vibe and his dark demeanor which are somehow present in nearly everything he does turns me off, however, if in his acting career a part was made for him then this was most certainly it.  If the look in his eyes during certain scenes in Christine does not give you the heebie jeebies then maybe you're not quite human.A high point in the film is character development as far as the two leads go: Arnie and Christine.  The movie certainly succeeds at making you feel for Christine to an extent.  One scene in which the bully Buddy Reperton exacts revenge on Arnie by taking his wrath out on Christine is truly cringe-worthy partially because it's gut-wrenching (for some) to see a beautiful car trashed for no reason other than pure hatred, but primarily because by that point you feel that she is more than just some car.We see Arnie evolve first from the dorky high school kid who gets pushed around into a man who seems to have confidence and charisma then into a downright scary, unpredictable, angry borderline lunatic.  Gordon clearly portrays Arnie during each phase rather than falling from just one extreme to the other.Another nice element in Christine is suspense.  There are not any truly slow parts and there is a nice ambiguity as far as whether Christine is running around by herself taking care of business, or regulating as it were, or whether Arnie is actually with her during certain shenanigans.  Once again, Gordon's performance is what sells it.On to the less-than-good.  The main thing about this movie that leaves me cold is the ending.  It's a little silly, although no sillier than the entire premise itself, I suppose.  I cannot even really say what I felt would have been better, if anything.  It may simply be that the end of the film is carried on the virtually non-existent shoulders of the two worst actors in the film, Stockwell and the always-terrible Alexandra Paul who, as always, leaves me feeling befuddled as far as how she ever broke into the biz.  At any rate it is possible that the ending is actually okay but the acting chops are not there to back it up.Christine is not going to be everyone's cup of tea but if one can stomach some of the weak supporting cast and a lackluster ending it is certainly worthwhile.",4,"""Okay...show me.""",1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,3198,"['Keith', 'Gordon', 'truly', 'creepy', 'performance', 'Arnie', 'Cunningham', 'geeky', 'intelligent', '17-yr-old', 'outcast', 'who', 'bullied', 'constantly', 'have', 'luck', 'whatsoever', 'ladies', 'anything', 'else', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'friend', 'world', 'Dennis', 'Gilder', 'popular', 'good-looking', 'football', 'player', 'played', 'far', 'less', 'convincingly', 'John', 'Stockwell.Arnie', 'love', 'incredibly', 'dilapidated', ""'58"", 'Plymouth', 'Fury', 'feelings', 'car', 'are', 'ever', 'felt', 'human', 'being', 'intense', 'feelings', 'are', 'mutual', 'love', 'obsession', 'doom', 'anyone', 'who', 'interfere.While', 'Christine', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'movies', 'just', 'shy', 'being', 'truly', 'horrific', 'scary', 'most', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'films', 'opinion', 'thanks', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'most', 'definitely', 'very', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'get', 'skin', 'bit', 'Usually', 'Gordon', 'self-pitying', 'vibe', 'dark', 'demeanor', 'are', 'somehow', 'present', 'nearly', 'everything', 'turns', 'off', 'however', 'acting', 'career', 'part', 'was', 'made', 'then', 'was', 'most', 'certainly', 'look', 'eyes', 'certain', 'scenes', 'Christine', 'not', 'give', 'heebie', 'jeebies', 'then', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'human.A', 'high', 'point', 'film', 'character', 'development', 'as', 'far', 'two', 'leads', 'go', 'Arnie', 'Christine', 'movie', 'certainly', 'making', 'feel', 'Christine', 'extent', 'One', 'scene', 'bully', 'Buddy', 'Reperton', 'revenge', 'Arnie', 'taking', 'wrath', 'out', 'Christine', 'truly', 'cringe-worthy', 'partially', 'gut-wrenching', 'see', 'beautiful', 'car', 'trashed', 'reason', 'other', 'pure', 'hatred', 'primarily', 'point', 'feel', 'more', 'just', 'car.We', 'see', 'Arnie', 'evolve', 'first', 'dorky', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'who', 'pushed', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'confidence', 'charisma', 'then', 'downright', 'scary', 'unpredictable', 'angry', 'borderline', 'lunatic', 'Gordon', 'clearly', 'Arnie', 'phase', 'rather', 'falling', 'just', 'one', 'extreme', 'other.Another', 'nice', 'element', 'Christine', 'suspense', 'are', 'not', 'truly', 'slow', 'parts', 'nice', 'ambiguity', 'as', 'far', 'Christine', 'running', 'around', 'taking', 'care', 'business', 'regulating', 'were', 'Arnie', 'actually', 'certain', 'shenanigans', 'Once', 'again', 'Gordon', 'performance', 'what', 'it.On', 'less-than-good', 'main', 'thing', 'movie', 'cold', 'ending', 'little', 'silly', 'sillier', 'entire', 'premise', 'suppose', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'really', 'say', 'what', 'felt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'anything', 'may', 'simply', 'be', 'end', 'film', 'carried', 'virtually', 'non-existent', 'shoulders', 'two', 'worst', 'actors', 'film', 'Stockwell', 'always-terrible', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', 'who', 'always', 'feeling', 'befuddled', 'as', 'far', 'how', 'ever', 'broke', 'biz', 'rate', 'possible', 'ending', 'actually', 'okay', 'acting', 'chops', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'back', 'up.Christine', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'one', 'can', 'stomach', 'weak', 'supporting', 'cast', 'lackluster', 'ending', 'certainly', 'worthwhile']",N/A
18881,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,0767827716,William,"[1, 1]","The Christine: Special Edition DVD was released in Region 4 back in April and my review is on that.  According to reports, it is identical to the Special Edition to be released in US this August.I had not seen Christine since 1983, and remembered it being quite patchy and reasonably scary.  However, being a John Carpenter fan, I figured I would add it to my DVD collection (plus it was a good price).Seeing Christine again over 20 years later was interesting, but I still feel the film just loses my interest from about 3/4 into the film.  The storyline is far from Steven King's best works.  The acting is okay, but there is just something missing from this film to lift it to 'cult classic' in my opinion.The Special Edition DVD transfer is acceptable for its age, not a lot of restoration has gone into it. There are many scenes which look soft and a few that are out of focus. The best news is that you get the original 2:35 widescreen ratio.Features wise, three very short featurettes have been filmed especially for the DVD release.  The main one includes interviews with most of the cast, including the geek.  There are also trailers for other movies.Is it worth buying?  Only if you are a John Carpenter fan.

18882,AP3B615GM191G,0767827716,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 2]","Right off the bat, there are two ways of interpreting this film: If you haven't read the novel, you might find it a decent effort from filmmaker John Carpenter.  If you have read the Stephen King masterpiece, you'll be left feeling more than a bit unsatisfied.For a basic plot summary, ""Christine"" tells the story of an evil car who first grips young Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) with ""her"" menace, then schemes to murder his best friend Dennis (John Stockwell) & girlfriend Leigh (Alexandra Paul).The one nice thing I have to say about this film is that, if having read the book, it provides some nice visuals.  The characters are roughly what I pictured while reading, and the car scenes are very well done.Unfortunately, the pleasantries end there.  The plot (so magnificent at the pen of King) is an utter mess via Carpenter's camera, while the characters are more like caricatures of the actual King lifebloods.  I realize that some things need to be chopped in the name of film, but this was one of the worst jobs I've ever seen.  Without the knowledge that the book gives, I can't see anyone getting into this movie on an level deeper than ""horror flick"".To top things off, director Carpenter tries to add his ""Halloween touch"" by using the same visual style and music (almost to a ""tee"") as the first two Halloween films.  What a rip-off!  It really doesn't add much to this middling effort, and just made me think of Carpenter as a one-track wonder.Thus, this film can easily be skipped before or after reading the novel.  If the material must be covered in some format, leave the storytelling to Mr. King...in this case, where it belongs.",2,"Decent Visuals, But Nothing Else",1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,1651,"['Right', 'bat', 'are', 'two', 'ways', 'interpreting', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novel', 'might', 'find', 'decent', 'effort', 'filmmaker', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'have', 'read', 'Stephen', 'King', 'masterpiece', ""'ll"", 'be', 'left', 'feeling', 'more', 'bit', 'unsatisfied.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Christine', 'story', 'evil', 'car', 'who', 'first', 'young', 'Arnie', 'Cunningham', 'Keith', 'Gordon', 'menace', 'then', 'murder', 'best', 'friend', 'Dennis', 'John', 'Stockwell', 'girlfriend', 'Leigh', 'Alexandra', 'Paul', '.The', 'one', 'nice', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'nice', 'visuals', 'characters', 'are', 'roughly', 'what', 'pictured', 'reading', 'car', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done.Unfortunately', 'pleasantries', 'end', 'there', 'plot', 'so', 'magnificent', 'pen', 'King', 'utter', 'mess', 'Carpenter', 'camera', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'like', 'caricatures', 'actual', 'King', 'lifebloods', 'realize', 'things', 'need', 'be', 'chopped', 'name', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'worst', 'jobs', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'knowledge', 'book', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'getting', 'movie', 'level', 'deeper', 'horror', 'flick', 'top', 'things', 'off', 'director', 'Carpenter', 'tries', 'add', 'Halloween', 'touch', 'using', 'same', 'visual', 'style', 'music', 'almost', 'tee', 'first', 'two', 'Halloween', 'films', 'What', 'rip-off', 'really', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'middling', 'effort', 'just', 'made', 'think', 'Carpenter', 'one-track', 'wonder.Thus', 'film', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'skipped', 'reading', 'novel', 'material', 'must', 'be', 'covered', 'format', 'leave', 'storytelling', 'Mr.', 'King', 'case', 'where']",N/A
