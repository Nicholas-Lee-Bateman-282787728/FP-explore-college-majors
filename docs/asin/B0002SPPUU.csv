What are meant to propagandistically emotionally manipulative scenes show specifically how neglect of our borders and laws merely benefits and profits the most expolitive coyotes and employers.  And of course this film shows no awareness or irony regarding the reality that Mexico has the most stringent immigration laws in the world.  Whenever the U.S. meekly struggles to enforce some measures, such are merely shadows of the Mexican reality.  For example, in Mexico, being an illegal immigrant is a felony-helping someone immigrate illegally is also a crime.  The Mexican government also ruitinely deports more illegal immigrants than the U.S. could ever dream of.

844718,AQ01Q3070LT29,B0002SPPUU,James McDonald,"[6, 10]","This U.S. Border Patrol agent, Adam Fields (John Carlos Frey) is angry with his job for keeping him behind.  He is angry with his wife and doesn't want intimacy with her everytime she wants it and his past bothers him too.  He has no father because his mother, now gravely sick, doesn't know which ""john"" out of many it could have been.  He refuses the blood money inheritance.  So he ""moonlights"" to catch border smugglers.  Clearly he deserves a promotion by now.  He poses as a Mexican who wants to illegally get into America.  He goes to the pottery gift shop where in the back room is a different operation.  A secretary is there.  They want 30,000 pesos to transport him and he will have to work one full year with them to pay the rest.  Along with the other mexicans, he is forced to carry a gallon of clear substance.  They are not to open it or drink it.  It is a chemical or acid used for drugs.  It will burn through your skin.  If you do not have the jug after the walk, they will not give you a ride in.  Now Adam knows for sure this is the illegal smuggling group.  He makes it through, but some are shot to death.  Now he is a migrant worker and his plan is about to backfire.  There are no phones where he is at.  No way to call his work.  He is getting deeper and deeper with no way out.Hollywood does it again.  Not one shot was filmed inside Mexico, but shot entirly in San Diego, California.DVD includes optional Spanish subtitles.",4,Can a moonlighting border agent make it back to USA?,1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,1451,"['U.S.', 'Border', 'Patrol', 'agent', 'Adam', 'Fields', 'John', 'Carlos', 'Frey', 'angry', 'job', 'keeping', 'behind', 'angry', 'wife', ""n't"", 'want', 'intimacy', 'everytime', 'past', 'bothers', 'too', 'father', 'mother', 'now', 'gravely', 'sick', ""n't"", 'know', 'john', 'many', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'blood', 'money', 'inheritance', 'moonlights', 'catch', 'border', 'smugglers', 'Clearly', 'promotion', 'now', 'Mexican', 'who', 'illegally', 'get', 'America', 'pottery', 'gift', 'shop', 'where', 'back', 'room', 'different', 'operation', 'secretary', 'there', 'want', '30,000', 'pesos', 'transport', 'will', 'have', 'work', 'one', 'full', 'year', 'pay', 'rest', 'other', 'mexicans', 'forced', 'carry', 'gallon', 'clear', 'substance', 'are', 'not', 'open', 'drink', 'chemical', 'acid', 'used', 'drugs', 'will', 'burn', 'skin', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'jug', 'walk', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'ride', 'Now', 'Adam', 'sure', 'illegal', 'smuggling', 'group', 'are', 'shot', 'death', 'Now', 'migrant', 'worker', 'plan', 'backfire', 'are', 'phones', 'where', 'way', 'call', 'work', 'getting', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'way', 'out.Hollywood', 'again', 'Not', 'one', 'shot', 'was', 'filmed', 'Mexico', 'shot', 'entirly', 'San', 'Diego', 'California.DVD', 'optional', 'Spanish', 'subtitles']",The Gatekeeper
844719,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B0002SPPUU,Jeffery Mingo,"[9, 9]","This film is about a biracial man from a single parent home.  He is racist and xenophobic.  His bigoted peers convince him to sneak across the border in order to help Border Patrol.  The plan gets fouled and he finds out what happens to many Mexican immigrants: slavery, rape, and nefarious abuses.  I know someone who thought this film was sexist, but I think the main character is meant to be confused and one of his ways of showing that is through misogyny.  This director mortgaged his home in order to finance this film.  He's a cutie and you get to see his body really quickly in this work.  I wish him best of luck behind the camera, but I hope he gets to appear in front of the camera just as much.  Many people outside of California and Texas believe anything they are told about ""illegal"" immigration; this film is a low-budget, but well-intentioned, attempt to try to reverse that discourse into progressive directions.",4,good for its intentions,1099872000,"11 8, 2004",2004,930,"['film', 'biracial', 'man', 'single', 'parent', 'home', 'racist', 'xenophobic', 'bigoted', 'peers', 'convince', 'sneak', 'border', 'order', 'help', 'Border', 'Patrol', 'plan', 'fouled', 'out', 'what', 'many', 'Mexican', 'immigrants', 'slavery', 'rape', 'nefarious', 'abuses', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'sexist', 'think', 'main', 'character', 'meant', 'be', 'confused', 'one', 'ways', 'showing', 'misogyny', 'director', 'mortgaged', 'home', 'order', 'finance', 'film', 'cutie', 'get', 'see', 'body', 'really', 'quickly', 'work', 'wish', 'best', 'luck', 'camera', 'hope', 'appear', 'front', 'camera', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Many', 'people', 'California', 'Texas', 'believe', 'anything', 'are', 'told', 'illegal', 'immigration', 'film', 'low-budget', 'well-intentioned', 'attempt', 'try', 'reverse', 'discourse', 'progressive', 'directions']",The Gatekeeper
