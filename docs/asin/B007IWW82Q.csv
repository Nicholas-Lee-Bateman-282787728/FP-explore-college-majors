I think that's about the most you can expect from any drama: to feel something.This is very much an indie film with an indie budget. It's also every bit a postmodern tale, so some plot points aren't fully explained. As another reviewer noted, the ending is a bit nebulous; it's the least satisfying part of the tale. The good thing about nebulous endings, though, is that you can decide for yourself what happened. In that regard, it reminds me of the infamous final episode of ""The Sopranos,"" which was sort of a Rorschach test; viewers had to interpret it for themselves.I won't recount the plot, as others here have done that, but I will say that the lead -- who also wrote and directed -- was the strongest member of the cast. Other characters weren't fully realized, which could be a flaw or a device to keep the main narrative on track.All in all, though, I found it an effective and thoughtful movie. The credits have stopped now, but I still feel that mix of hope and sadness.

He survives; not only that but finds in the process that he has gained the power to heal people,As with all people that gain abilities he must figure out why (if there is a why) and how to handle it. Eventually he will have to go home and come to grips with whom he is and in the process wrap up some unfinished business.The pace is a bit slow and it counts on more visual than verbal description.

1531660,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B007IWW82Q,Eric Sanberg,"[1, 1]","This is a bit like ""Phenomenon"" with John Travolta but lacks, by comparison, in essentially every category.Here's the scoop. James takes a dive off a 200 ft. cliff. But instead of buying the big one, he survives only to find out he now has the power to heal others. He does a stint in jail, for reasons I won't divulge, but heads back home after his release to try and put his life back together.This started out pretty good. I found myself drawn into the story early on and found I liked the characters at first glance. But as things progressed I started to get frustrated. I don't want to say the story lacked focus but, for my dollar, they needed a more dynamic path to the end. I got it. I got what they were saying, but it needed more umph. Some of the scenes were a bit too cute and some didn't make much sense. Marcus Dean Fuller, the writer, director and lead actor, has spent most of his career in TV and it shows. The way some of the characters were drawn and the shots set up were very TV.Fuller wrote the script for himself and he's the hi-light as far as the performances go. The other primary actors do a decent enough job but things slide down from there. The outdoor sets were cool. The indoor sets were run of the mill. The music was decent enough.This is a decent indy effort. It's not a bad watch.
