No idea why they made this the way they did---it's far too childish for adults, and far too mature for children.  Adults would certainly be entertained, though.Obviously the main theme deals far too much with adult themes involving individuality, conformity, significance, self awareness, etcetera.  Loads of ""Hey it's that guy/girl!"" voice moments, as Woody Allen plays Z, Sylvester Stallone plays Weaver, Jennifer Lopez plays Azteca, Sharon Stone plays Princess Bala, Gene Hackman plays General Stupid, Christopher Walken plays Colonel Cutter, Danny Glover plays Barbatus in what amounts to a glorified cameo, Anne Bancroft plays the Queen, etcetera.Me being the militant military person I am, I have some problems with General Stupid, who I named that because he is quite frankly stupid.  It's not really a major storyline moment, but a major plot point, in which the Antz are sent on a blatant suicide mission to attack a Termite colony.  General Stupid acknowledges this is a suicide mission.  Exactly what purpose this serves is still a total mystery to me, as all it could accomplish is massacreing thousands of Ant soldiers, and provoking the Termites into war that they could ATTACK THE ANT COLONY WHICH NOW HAS LESS OR NO SOLDIERS TO DEFEND IT.  Unless he wants the Colony to be destroyed, there's no logic at all in his stupidity.The battle scene gave me the impression of an army of something like Zulu warriors (not an insult) against an army of ELEPHANTS with FLAMETHROWERS on their heads.  The Antz are armed with short spears (or rather, sticks), no armor, but are fast and agile and can jump around.  The Termites are gigantic and overly fat, and shoot acid from their foreheads.  Either Rule of Cool superceded actual research, or there was a critical research failure, as Termites do not work that way, either in appearance or function.Speaking of a case of either Rule of Cool/Critical Research Failure, magnifying glasses do not work that way on ants.  But I figure instantly turning to ash is less brutal for kids than an ant writhing about at fast speed.  Even though kids would likely do that in real life, it's a lot different when the ants are like humans.But leaving those nitpicking things aside, this is NOT a movie for kids.  The content is too mature, the faces are a bit creepy for kids (which is exactly what I thought as a kid), and even now I still don't really like the film.  It's a bit too stale and too averse to maturity.  But even then, I still acknowledge it's a decent film, unfortunately spoiled by being inappropriate for its target audience.

Antz is to standard animation as 1984 is to political novels. What's more, it out-1984s 1984, and is in the league of, but not as political as, Rand's &quot;Anthem&quot;.Antz is the story of a neurotic worker ant named Z-4195, masterly scripted and voiced by Woody Allen, as a depressed individualist in a microcosm where complete conformity, obedience and class-based social structure is the rule. The only thing that keeps him from becoming a total outcast is his friend Weaver, a soldier ant voiced by Sylvester Stallone.Attracted to the princess of the colony, &quot;Z&quot; switches places with Weaver in a ploy to see her again, but is caught in a full-scale battle with a termite colony where he is the only survivor. While his individualism becomes contagious and creates turmoil amongst the other ants, he and the princess set in a journey to try to find the fabled Insectopia.Other voice actors are Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Anne Bancroft, Christopher Walken, Jennifer Lopez, Danny Glover, and Dan Aykroyd. As goofy as the voice casting choices may sound, they really work. The humour will probably appeal more to adults than children (as for example Woody Allen pointing out that &quot;when you're the middle child in a family of five million, you don't get any attention.&quot;). The views of the colony are impressive, even for an animation. A sense of scale and wonder is maintained throughout, under as well as over ground. The Insectopia, for example, turns out to be a picnic which, thanks to plastic bags and a looking glass, is more work than expected.As a nice touch, there are socialist slogans everywhere, like &quot;FREE TIME IS FOR TRAINING&quot; (an actual real-life PDI slogan), and even an Atlas ant, in Atlas Shrugged pose, with the words &quot;CONQUER IDLENESS&quot;. The evils of statism are not presented as stereotypical evil, but rather as an honestly-held belief, just as they are in real life. Even the backstabbing General Mandible is motivated by an ideology which, to simple minds, would make sense. While the worker ants rise up against their oppressors, they still hold their false premises, and chant socialist slogans : and as well they are quickly turned back into obedience by promises of more material gain by General Mandible.While Disney continues to churn out mediocre animation which preaches the evils of collectivism, obedience and altruism (including the competitor to Antz, &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;), Antz is an incredible case in point of rationality, coupled with good humour, a sense of wonder, and modern technology, triumphing in modern movies.

There is a star-studded cast in there as well, Woody Allen, Gene Hackman, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Lopez, and it is really nice to see all of them getting into the material and really doing something different. Woody Allen, voicing Z, really manages to bring out the adult humour in the film, which gives the kids and the grown-ups plenty to enjoy. However, it's really the script and the beautiful animation that take the cake in this fabulous journey through the life of an ant that is really one of the best movies of 1998.",5,Impressive in pretty much all areas of animated filmmaking.,991526400,"06 3, 2001",2001,1078,"['Antz', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'twice', 'appreciate', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'sitting', 'movie', 'theatre', 'when', 'came', 'television', 'recently', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'had', 'knot', 'was', 'totally', 'shocked', 'fantastically', 'original', 'script', 'had', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'earlier', 'many', 'cool', 'jokes', 'story', 'ant', 'who', 'freedom', 'can', 'really', 'relate', 'characters', 'maybe', 'not', 'looks', 'Z', 'very', 'detailed', 'truthful', 'role', 'model', 'children', '7', '10', 'years', 'age', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'really', 'nice', 'see', 'getting', 'material', 'really', 'doing', 'something', 'different', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'voicing', 'Z', 'really', 'bring', 'out', 'adult', 'humour', 'film', 'kids', 'grown-ups', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'However', 'really', 'script', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'take', 'cake', 'fabulous', 'journey', 'life', 'ant', 'really', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '1998']",N/A

The evil  powers at play are the soldiers led by the sturdy, strict General Mandible.  His way of gaining power is slaughtering the ants that resist him and  marrying the queen's daughter. The story is simple. However, it allows us  to look into it and make out comparisons to past revolutions. If you don't  enjoy this, the movie is also quite entertaining. Filled with good one  liners and humorous situations, &quot;Antz&quot; is also a crowd pleaser.

Let me also say that the animation on this movie is wonderful. ""Antz"" is one of those movies that perhaps won't stick with us forever, but is still memorable and thought-provoking. Despite how it was promoted, this is not a children's movie. First of all, the swearing is a little too much for a very young child, and there are some pretty graphic sequences. Secondly, though this is nothing against the movie, the themes are too deep for a child to truly comprehend. A better kid's film about insects is ""A Bug's Life"" (which is also a fantastic movie).The anti-communistic motives and themes of individuality are well presented, and the voice acting is superb (Allen as the puny Z presents a perfectly whiny voice, that fits his character to a tee.) The menacing General Mandibly and his henchman, Cutter, are perfectly crafted by their respective voice actors. The overall plot is also terrific, and for what was to be a children's film, the termite v. ant battle is spectacularly done- very exciting.The overall idea of a lowly worker becoming a leader of his people has been done many times, and ""Antz"" sticks with a tried and true notion.

64014,A152C8GYY25HAH,0783231474,Matthew Horner,"[0, 1]","Now that Dreamworks has become a thriving studio, animation has seen a big revival. In past years, there was often only one such picture [always from Disney], but 1998 saw five major releases. They ranged from the mediocre Rugrats to the extraordinary Antz.Part of what makes Antz so special is that it is appealing to kids and to a broad range of adults. Years ago, there were many movies that did this. Today, when we watch such movies with our children, watching them be entertained is often more amusing to us than what's on the screen.The makers of Antz created it primarily through computer technology, rather than the traditional hand drawn method. This choice has produced a visually stunning movie. I do not think it diminishes animation as an art form. It simply uses the latest tools. Computerized drawing is much faster, but mastery of it is tedious and difficult.The ants in Antz have been skillfully created. They are insects with human features. They stand upright and have human facial features and hands. These hybrid creatures do not look grotesque at all. In fact, they are very appealing. What's most interesting is that each face resembles that of the star who is the character's voice.While the story line is a typical of this genre, its dialogue, as well its visuals, lift it above the imitative and the mediocre.The hero is a worker ant named Z-4195, who is different and want to be an individual. &quot;I was the middle child in a family of five million, &quot; he explains at the start of the movie. The voice is Woody Allen's, who succeeds here better than he has recently in his own films.Z-4195 meets and falls in love with Bala, the colony's princess. She is engaged to Gen. Mandible, who, of course, turns out to be planning a takeover of the colony. Z fights a terrible war with termites, flees the colony with the princess, discovers &quot;Insectopia&quot; and returns to save the other ants from Mandible.All of this is done at a fast pace, so there's hardly a dull moment. The dialog is sharp and funny. Some of it will mean one thing to adults and another to children, but none of it will offend anyone, save for the most pious among us.Antz even has a message or two. One is that it can be dangerous for a group when everyone in it thinks alike. The other is that those on the lower end of the social ladder are not only important, but can be much stronger than they are given credit for.While the ants are necessarily humanized, their point of view remains that of the tiny creatures that they are. Even &quot;Insectopia&quot;, their version of Heaven on Earth, is very much a bug's vision.The film score is excellent, and fits the movie perfectly. Surprisingly, Dreamworks opted to use some wonderful old popular songs, which makes for a pleasant change.The only problem with Antz is that you may find that, after watching it with the kids, you may watch it again when they've gone to bed. It's that much fun.",5,Fantastic animated fare,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,2948,"['Now', 'Dreamworks', 'become', 'thriving', 'studio', 'animation', 'seen', 'big', 'revival', 'past', 'years', 'was', 'often', 'only', 'one', 'such', 'picture', '[', 'always', 'Disney', ']', '1998', 'saw', 'five', 'major', 'releases', 'ranged', 'mediocre', 'Rugrats', 'extraordinary', 'Antz.Part', 'what', 'Antz', 'special', 'appealing', 'kids', 'broad', 'range', 'adults', 'Years', 'ago', 'were', 'many', 'movies', 'did', 'Today', 'when', 'watch', 'such', 'movies', 'children', 'watching', 'be', 'entertained', 'often', 'more', 'amusing', 'what', 'screen.The', 'makers', 'Antz', 'created', 'primarily', 'computer', 'technology', 'rather', 'traditional', 'hand', 'drawn', 'method', 'choice', 'produced', 'visually', 'stunning', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'animation', 'art', 'form', 'simply', 'latest', 'tools', 'Computerized', 'drawing', 'much', 'faster', 'mastery', 'tedious', 'difficult.The', 'ants', 'Antz', 'have', 'been', 'skillfully', 'created', 'are', 'insects', 'human', 'features', 'stand', 'upright', 'have', 'human', 'facial', 'features', 'hands', 'hybrid', 'creatures', 'do', 'not', 'look', 'grotesque', 'fact', 'are', 'very', 'appealing', 'What', 'most', 'interesting', 'face', 'star', 'who', 'character', 'story', 'line', 'typical', 'genre', 'dialogue', 'as', 'well', 'visuals', 'lift', 'imitative', 'mediocre.The', 'hero', 'worker', 'ant', 'named', 'Z-4195', 'who', 'different', 'want', 'be', 'individual', 'quot', 'was', 'middle', 'child', 'family', 'five', 'million', 'quot', 'start', 'movie', 'voice', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'who', 'here', 'better', 'recently', 'own', 'films.Z-4195', 'meets', 'falls', 'love', 'Bala', 'colony', 'princess', 'engaged', 'Gen.', 'Mandible', 'who', 'course', 'out', 'be', 'planning', 'takeover', 'colony', 'Z', 'terrible', 'war', 'termites', 'colony', 'princess', 'discovers', 'quot', 'Insectopia', 'quot', 'returns', 'save', 'other', 'ants', 'Mandible.All', 'done', 'fast', 'pace', 'hardly', 'dull', 'moment', 'dialog', 'sharp', 'funny', 'will', 'mean', 'one', 'thing', 'adults', 'children', 'none', 'will', 'offend', 'anyone', 'save', 'most', 'pious', 'us.Antz', 'even', 'message', 'two', 'One', 'can', 'be', 'dangerous', 'group', 'when', 'everyone', 'alike', 'other', 'lower', 'end', 'social', 'ladder', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'important', 'can', 'be', 'much', 'stronger', 'are', 'given', 'credit', 'ants', 'are', 'necessarily', 'humanized', 'point', 'view', 'tiny', 'creatures', 'are', 'Even', 'quot', 'Insectopia', 'quot', 'version', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'very', 'much', 'bug', 'vision.The', 'film', 'score', 'excellent', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'Surprisingly', 'Dreamworks', 'opted', 'use', 'wonderful', 'old', 'popular', 'songs', 'pleasant', 'change.The', 'only', 'problem', 'Antz', 'may', 'find', 'watching', 'kids', 'may', 'watch', 'again', 'when', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'bed', 'much', 'fun']",N/A

Each parent is going to have their own rules and words that they'll tolerate their kids saying.  With that said, my daughter is 3 and two words that I, personally, don't think is appropriate for her to say are 'damn' and 'hell'.  Being 3 she'll repeat anything she hears thus my comment about her not being able to watch it.  When you throw in the fact that there's more graphic violence in this animated movie than any I've ever seen it makes me disappointedly put a good movie aside until she's older.  How much older?

64029,AHF97M45JFCB,0783231474,ONENEO,"[2, 3]","If you could go back to 1998 (something that I would give serious consideration to by the way), you would find that the computer generated animated feature film was in its infancy.  All that existed prior was Pixar's Toy Story.  Suddenly the powers-that-be had insects on their collective minds as the subject for best exploiting the new medium.In fact a very strong argument could be made that it was these bug flicks of 1998 that firmly cemented a rivalry between DreamWorks and Pixar that is still going strong today some 12-years later.Interestingly, while Disney/ Pixar's A Bug's Life followed the more traditional path of basically turning a classic family-oriented 2D feature into the 3D domain, Antz actually comes off as an animated incarnation of a classic Woody Allen picture, complete with all of the adult gags that make his work so endearing.  Picture the insecurities, the esteem issues, the ""what is the meaning of life"" angles that make summarize the Woody Allen experience but coupled to a solid children's medium (complete with the nice clean character designs and a well-constructed user-friendly plot).The story tells of one Z-4195 (Z for short), a neurotic worker ant amidst a family of 5-million strong.Z is in therapy because he's an individual in a colony where conformity is not only desirable, but also mandatory for daily survival.  One night, while at a bar, he dances with the incognito Princess Bala and immediately becomes obsessed with her.After much scheming, he ends up presenting a plan to his soldier-class ant friend Weaver for a day. Things go terribly wrong, however, when the evil General Mandible declares war on a nearby termite colony and poor Z finds himself in the heat of battle.Truth be told, Antz makes very valid use of the ideal that hindsight is often much clearer.  Now that computer-generated features are no longer in their infancy, it's clear that Antz was actually grittier and more subtly mature than most of the animated films of recent years.  The language is a little bit sharper (a few cusses), there are some intense visuals (a battle scene that looks as if it were transplanted directly from 1997's Starship Troopers, the dying decapitated head of one of Z's friends), and a little bit of nastiness that could make an adult squirm (a gondola ride through a rotting fish head, some bugs eating a chunk of feces and so on).Make no mistake, these aren't deterrents to the ""fun for all ages"" aspect of the film so much as they are interesting little signs of the whole genre's evolution toward kid-friendliness.  Many of these gags simply wouldn't fly today even in a DreamWorks picture, which, I typically consider to be the most adult of the current animation studios.In all Antz is quite enjoyable on many levels and in my opinion, superior to the generally considered impeccable, A Bug's Life.  There is enough cuteness and morality to keep the kiddies involved but the humor is such that adults may even enjoy it more than the youngsters.

Dua-Brown ""patchdb7""","[20, 27]","The Film: [Rating: 84%] Dreamworks challenger to the Disney ant favourite A Bug's Life arrives on a feature packed DVD complete with a truly sumptuous transfer. Ok, so it's a cartoon - but don't be put off since this  one is loaded with far more wit and style than your average kiddie flick  (isn't he in a A Bug's Life?) and features the vocal talents of Woody  Allen, Sharon Stone, Dan Aykroyd, Gene Hackman, Danny Glover, Jennifer  Lopez, Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Walken, Anne Bancroft and a shed  load more fine actors. Imagine this many actors in a live-action film, the  fees, the makeup, the trailer size contests - I guess doing animation must  be a welcome bit of fun, allowing dress-down days too!The story follows  loner ant Z (pronounced zee, not zed!) who feels there should be more to  life than his lot as a worker ant. Allen plays the lead, supported well be  his best friend and soldier ant Weaver (Stallone). Z's path crosses that of  the bored Princess Bala (Stone) whom he desperately wants to see again.  Following a little persuasion, Z manages to trade places with Weaver for a  place in the soldier's parade - held in front of the royalty! I don't want  to give too much of the plot away since you're better off watching but Z's  adventures to win the heart of the Princess, battle fierce termites  Starship Troopers style, and his all round save-the-day antics are a treat  for young and old alike. Kids will love this great cartoon but only adults  will catch all of the humour and admire the truly stunning computer  animation.It's a pity this was released only one month before Disney's  ant based film and the subsequent press scrutiny they both received in the  'Ant Wars'. They are very different films, just both animated and about  ants. Personally I rate Antz slightly higher but I also think that from a  kid's point of view the adult nature of much of it's humour may put A Bug's  Life out in front as a point decision winner. Take the easy route and give  both pride of place in your DVD collection!The Picture: [Rating: 93%]  Gob smacking! Awesome! Breath-taking! What more can be said about this  1.85:1 original aspect ratio transfer from an all digital source. Colours  are to die for - see the Trash-topia sequence to see what I mean, black  levels are spot on, detail is truly amazing, and there's not a single  imperfection noticeable anywhere. There was some reported moans that the  film was based underground too much, resulting in a too dark, earthy look -  maybe an issue with a VHS copy but not here. This is what DVD and  widescreen were made for!The Sound: [Rating: 82%] Again, absolutely  awesome (do I have to add the word DUDE to truly convince?). Some have  mentioned the drowning out of vocals during some of the terrifically loud  action sequences but this didn't affect me, even on (or maybe because of)  my 'pantz' audio set up.The Extras: [Rating: 70%] Directors Tim Johnson  and Eric Darnel feature on an informative full-length audio commentary.  There's a production featurette running under 5 minutes that is more  interview soundbites than anything else. Much more revealing is the 11  minutes on The Basics of Computer Animation - focusing on the dance  sequence and the water droplet, showing build up from storyboards to the  finished, lighted &amp; shaded animation. Brief but nice is the one minute  on the Antz Facial System. Last of the documentaries is 10 minutes 26  seconds worth of wonderful hand-drawn art work showing the development of  the Antz Character Design. There are four TV spots, along with the  theatrical trailer, but the usual filmo's are blown away by a simple cast  list. Finally there's also eight pages worth of production notes.

64038,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,0783231474,Robert J. Schneider,"[2, 4]","&quot;The Battle of the Bugs&quot; is what the media labeled Dreamworks SKG's (successful) attempt to get their 3-D animated bug story released in theaters before Disney did, although the former began production several weeks after the latter. Whose film would be released first: The Company of Michael Eisner, or that of his former disgruntled employee Jeffrey Katzenberg? In retrospect, this behind-the-scenes drama seems more than a bit silly, because: 1) That a similarly-themed movie is released first does not necessarily guarantee bigger box office than its competition, and 2) The solidly-PG-rated ANTZ has less in common with the indisputably-G-rated A BUG'S LIFE than one might think, and 3) Therefore, each film attracted a different audience. As it turned out, both films were smash hits: A BUG'S LIFE made a lot more money (as I'm sure it was destined to do), but ANTZ garnered better reviews.Dreamworks SKG's ANTZ, co-directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson, and released in September of 1998 (a full month before Disney/Pixar's A BUG'S LIFE), tells the very engaging story of a neurotic, lowly worker ant simply named Z (wouldn't his name be Zed in the British version?) voiced by The Woodman himself, whose constantly nagging thoughts of a better existence outside the mindless ant colony drive him to distraction. I love the opening scene with him on the ant psychologist's couch--it's classic Woody from his early comedic period! Actually, the entire film's script is like that, reading like one of his early classics such as TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (1969) or PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM (1972). After a decade of directing brilliant but increasingly heavy-handed films beginning with CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS (1989), it's refreshing to hear Woody Allen voicing a role that reminds us of how funny a comedic actor he is. The casting of Allen is the lead role here was pure genius.My advice is to see this film with an open mind; forget about &quot;The Battle of the Bugs&quot; as ANTZ has really nothing whatsoever to do with A BUG'S LIFE, with the only exception being that both films star a nerdy ant who attempts to win the affection of the ant colony princess. That's the only similarity! Otherwise, ANTZ is a much-more-grownup story dealing with Z's attempt to woo Princess Bala (Sharon Stone, brilliantly expressive in a surprisingly comedic role) by switching places with his big, macho soldier-ant friend Weaver (Sylvester Stallone, in a fun and equally surprisingly comedic role of his own). Unfortunately for Z, Princess Bala's powerful, but darkly sinister, fiancee General Mandible (Gene Hackman) sends the ant colony into battle against a nearby termite colony, in which Z pairs up with gungo-ho soldier-ant Barbatus (Danny Glover) who saves his life in battle. Being the only ant who survives the battle (which is a bit gruesome, by the way), Z is welcomed back as the unlikely hero, 'accidentally' kidnaps Princess Bala and seeks out this land of freedom known as Insectopia, about which he was told by an old, crazy ant at the ant-bar. Inspired by his example, the other worker ants begin revolting against their way of life, hilariously spouting Socialist slogans along the way. The Queen (Anne Bancroft) is concerned; however, General Mandible has plans of his own.ANTZ is darkly comic and self-knowing; it never takes itself too seriously. One aspect for which it has been criticized is how literally dark it is; taking place mostly inside an underground ant colony, it is mostly sepia-toned. A BUG'S LIFE has more primary colors throughout. (Although to an unrealistic extent---I mean, c'mon, when have you ever seen blue ants?) However, the scenes outside the ant colony in ANTS are actually very bright and colorful. Again, these are just two different films: ANTS, with its mildly adult language, themes and occasional violence, is definitely PG-rated. Its humor is appreciated more by adults than kids. That doesn't mean you should go the extreme route of not letting your pre-teen kid see it (it is, after all, rated PG, not PG-13); however, I wouldn't recommend it for the under-8-year-old-set either. Like with anything else, just use your judgment.The final verdict in my review: ANTZ is a very entertaining combination of 3-D animation and excellent voice-over acting by excellent (and very well-cast) actors such as all who were previously named, plus Christopher Walken, Dan Aykroyd, Jennifer Lopez, John Mahoney, Grant Shaud and Paul Mazursky. It is true that A BUG'S LIFE has superior animation; however, ANTZ has the better and more engaging story. My recommendation is to show A BUG'S LIFE to your 4-year-old-and-above kids; when they reach 8, then start showing them ANTZ. Again, these films have different audiences, and therefore different things to appreciate about each of them. The good thing is that each movie can be appreciated on various levels, so the audience for each is still pretty wide. It's just that ANTZ's audience is not quite as wide as A BUG'S LIFE. But that's okay; ANTZ succeeds brilliantly in its mission to provide an entertaining combo of action for older pre-teen kids and humor for teens/adults. Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't offer a lot of extras, but what it does contain is quite cool, especially the behind-the-scenes look at the film. If you like this type of humor and appreciate 3-D animation, then buy ANTZ if you haven't already done so.RECOMMENDEDHIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR WOODY ALLEN FANS",4,CGI Ant Story Meets Early Woody

The  film was much more than just the opening scene. There is action, betrayal,  jealousy, loyalty, adventure, bravery and more. This is not just a film for  kids... the animation is awesome and very and the characters are endearing.  There are so many clever insights into what it would be like to be that  small... things that you've never really thought of.We see Z, a lowly  worker in a culture where the welfare of the colony far outweighs the  welfare of the individual, who is unsatisfied with his station in life.  Through his perserverance and love for the colony, he ends up exceeding  even his own expectations. This is an encouraging movie for kids who feel  like they're the only ones in class that wear glasses or if they're the  last one picked for sports teams. It shows that trying your best and being  a good friend are more important than where you come from or what everyone  expects of you.The DVD is chock full of goodies including theatrical  trailers and a behind-the-scenes featurette.

64048,A293NSDISZ9ZYP,0783231474,Stefan Haselsteiner,"[1, 2]","Antz, the first computer generated animated film from Dreamworks Studios, is a light and breezy comedy of completely mistaken proportions. Fellow ant Z (voice of Woody Allen) has a problem relating to a society wereby an  identity of any magnitude is frowned upon, seen as a weak link in a  population of billions. Z's neurosis typical gets the better of him (so  Woody Allenish) when he finds himself not only falling for the Princess  (Stone) but enlisted in a battalion that has marched off to wage war with  some nearby termites. Being a sole survivor after the battle leaves the  entire regiment dead he is afforded hero worship status until the cat is  blown out of the bag that he is just a plain worker and not a soldier.To  add turmoil to the recipe he accidentally kidnaps the princess and embarks  on wild search for &quot;Insectopia&quot; a land were bug's of all kinds  can live in peace and exercise the right of their own identity. When it  becomes apparent that the army General (Hackman) has a few ideas of his own  in order to flush out the weak links of the colony and build a new and  stronger one with the unwilling aid of the princess, does Z's neurosis of  total insignifigance help him aid the colony to become the biggest hero of  them all. Filled with witty one liners, which may sweep over most childrens  heads, and superb computer generated imagery, elevate this yarn to highly  enjoyable status.

64049,A3SY9XICFMY3U8,0783231474,Steve Rusher,"[0, 1]","The unfortunate thing with Antz is that it got released around the same  time as A Bug's Life, which had significantly better special effects.  Still, overall, I believe Antz wins over A Bug's Life in the long  run.The whole story stars Z, a ranting, individualistic ant played by  Woody Allen (who also looks like E.T. in my opinion), and Princess Bala,  the fun-loving (and spoiled) heir to the ant throne played by Sharon Stone.  Other characters include the evil General Mandible, voiced perfectly by  Gene Hackman, an over-expectant yellow jacket called Chip (Dan Ackroyd),  and Weaver, a &quot;lady's man&quot; soldier ant played by Sylvester  Stalone.The whole storyline seems to hint of The Prince and the Pauper,  but later turns into just another &quot;baddie manipulates the system to  get what he wants&quot; movie.  Simplistic plot, really, but that doesn't  stop the movie from being comical, which is probably what its directors  intended more than anything.  The humor is probably best suited to the  teenager crowd, despite the movie's PG rating, although I'm sure kids would  enjoy this movie as well.The movie is also filled with many small  Flinstones-ish mini-jokes involving the usage of just about anything made  out of grass, dirt, or sticks as an everyday human appliance.  Most of the  humor is drawn from the over-cockiness of Weaver, the over-concerned nature  of Z, and essentially how over-acted all of the characters are.  Not a  great place to draw humor, but Antz pulls it off nicely.Conclusively,  this movie is nothing next to A Bug's Life in terms of 3D animation, but  don't let that stop you.
