The whole thing, while possibly very accurate in detailing the  thoughts and feelings of an acutely withdrawn child, left me feeling dead.  For the most part it bored me, and I found the acting irritating. I have  seen other movies with similar plots (House of cards, Mercury Rising) and  while most movies concering disturbed children seemed to be produced by  hacks, this has to take the cake. It wasn't even visually interesting, and  the only reason I gave it a two was because it has definate potential. It  just wasn't developed.",2,Just plain boring...,964137600,"07 21, 2000",2000,692,"[""'m"", 'veteran', 'Indie/low', 'budget', 'movies', 'can', 'usually', 'withstand', 'fair', 'amount', 'disjointedness', 'lack-of-direction', 'found', 'movie', 'distressing', 'whole', 'thing', 'possibly', 'very', 'accurate', 'detailing', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'acutely', 'withdrawn', 'child', 'left', 'feeling', 'dead', 'most', 'part', 'bored', 'found', 'acting', 'irritating', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'similar', 'plots', 'House', 'cards', 'Mercury', 'Rising', 'most', 'movies', 'concering', 'disturbed', 'children', 'seemed', 'be', 'produced', 'hacks', 'take', 'cake', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'visually', 'interesting', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'two', 'was', 'definate', 'potential', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'developed']",N/A

Narrated by the thoughts of a seven-year old who has opted to go mute as a protest of her parent's dissolving relationship, the movie is bitter-sweet.  The child is honest and insightful, intelligent but with dialog that is still convensingly a childs.  The visual themes in the movie were obviously well thought out. Color plays a big role as does the setting (mostly bedrooms) in placing the viewer in a certain mind frame.  I'm kind of facinated with very young actors/actresses who can pull off psychologically complex roles and this gal does it well.",5,"Quirky, subtle, psyche of a child",1058832000,"07 22, 2003",2003,584,"['movie', 'was', 'very', 'unique', 'Narrated', 'thoughts', 'seven-year', 'old', 'who', 'opted', 'go', 'mute', 'protest', 'parent', 'dissolving', 'relationship', 'movie', 'bitter-sweet', 'child', 'honest', 'insightful', 'intelligent', 'dialog', 'still', 'convensingly', 'childs', 'visual', 'themes', 'movie', 'were', 'obviously', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'Color', 'big', 'role', 'setting', 'mostly', 'bedrooms', 'placing', 'viewer', 'certain', 'mind', 'frame', ""'m"", 'kind', 'facinated', 'very', 'young', 'actors/actresses', 'who', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'psychologically', 'complex', 'roles', 'gal', 'well']",N/A

It is a beautiful, painful movie to watch if you were a child in a broken home; I sobbed my way through it with a pain in my heart, remembering things about my parents' divorce when I was five years old that I didn't even know I'd forgotten. The treatment of the subject matter is raw, simple and honest in a way American movies can never seem to achieve - there is no schmaltz, no saccharine over-sentimentality, no cutesiness. Just the truth. If you are a parent going through problems or even a divorce with your spouse, or if you are the product of a broken home, you will most likely find this film very moving.

This movie offers the chance to see what a child or children see when mommy and daddy are no longer inlove and how it affects them.
