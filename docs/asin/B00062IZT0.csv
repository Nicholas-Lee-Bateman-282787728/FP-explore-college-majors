It is far far away from one star, but I thought the presentation of the plot in the beginning could have been a lot better. The animation is pretty good and I had no problems with the english dubbing. I was very surprised at the Mediterranean setting; I found it a nice contrast. The music could be a little better, though.One main problem I had was not enought information was given about Niwa's transformation to Dark and why he has to steal these items his mother tells him to in the beginning. It is a little abrupt for my taste. The later episodes do a much better job of foreshadoing why Niwa has to steal these mystical items and goes more in depth with Dark.I'm probably being a little bit unfair with my rating since my other problem I have with the show is it seems a too childish for my taste. The unicorns, a cute bunny-like creature turns into Dark's wings, and the shojo romance didn't sit too well for me. I prefer something much more dark and mature.If you like light anime that doesn't make you depressed, then you should like DNAngel. If you're someone who wants the facts nice and smooth, then the first episode will make you cringe but you'll enjoy the later episodes. But if you're like me, someone who wants something very mature, then you should run away from that DNAngel DVD you see in the store.",2,Good but no five star.,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,1353,"['found', 'show', 'be', 'average', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'one', 'star', 'thought', 'presentation', 'plot', 'beginning', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'animation', 'pretty', 'good', 'had', 'problems', 'english', 'dubbing', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'Mediterranean', 'setting', 'found', 'nice', 'contrast', 'music', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'better', 'though.One', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'not', 'enought', 'information', 'was', 'given', 'Niwa', 'transformation', 'Dark', 'why', 'steal', 'items', 'mother', 'beginning', 'little', 'abrupt', 'taste', 'later', 'episodes', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'foreshadoing', 'why', 'Niwa', 'steal', 'mystical', 'items', 'more', 'depth', 'Dark.I', ""'m"", 'probably', 'being', 'little', 'bit', 'unfair', 'rating', 'other', 'problem', 'have', 'show', 'too', 'childish', 'taste', 'unicorns', 'cute', 'bunny-like', 'creature', 'Dark', 'wings', 'shojo', 'romance', 'did', ""n't"", 'sit', 'too', 'well', 'prefer', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'dark', 'mature.If', 'like', 'light', 'anime', ""n't"", 'make', 'depressed', 'then', 'should', 'like', 'DNAngel', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'facts', 'nice', 'smooth', 'then', 'first', 'episode', 'will', 'make', 'cringe', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'later', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'someone', 'who', 'something', 'very', 'mature', 'then', 'should', 'run', 'away', 'DNAngel', 'DVD', 'see', 'store']",D.N.

857502,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00062IZT0,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","""COOL!""  That was the first impression when looking at the character designs on the DVD cover of the first volume of ""D.N.Angel"".I decided to check out ""D.N.Angel"" and usually when there are cool character designs, I have high expectations for the anime series and anime fans, I'm proud to say that ""D.N.Angel"" does not disappoint.  It's definitely a series worth checking out!The storyline is about a teenager named Daisuke Niwa.  He has been receiving stealth training by his mother and his grandfather his whole life and really is not sure why he is doing it.Daisuke has a big crush for a girl named Risa and to kick off his 14th birthday, he's prepared to let her know that he likes her.Unfortunately,  that was until she tells him that she thinks of him only as a good friend.Daisuke is not exactly having a great birthday but unbeknownst to him, there is a surprise waiting for the new 14-year-old.All that training he learned was because he is the next person in the family line (in 40 years) to be the host of the legendary phantom thief known as Dark.It's all within his DNA and whenever he feels a desire for Risa (even through a photo), Daisuke will transform into Dark.  And his family immediately has him on missions to steal an artifact.Of course, Daisuke wants only to be a normal teen and the last thing he wants is to become the phantom thief, Dark.One reason is because when he turns into Dark, Dark becomes somewhat of a playboy who has his eyes set on Risa and poor Daisuke has no recollection of it even happening.  And to make things worse, Risa has falled in love with Dark.This sets up the storyline for ""D.N.Angel"" with a complicated love triangle, interesting characters and reminiscent to of one of my favorite mid-90's TV anime series, ""DNA^2"".The next two episodes feature Daisuke/Dark on missions to steal more artifacts but also the love triangle between Daisuke, Dark and Risa.But things get a bit more complicated in the first episode when Dark ends up kissing Risa's older twin sister, Riku.  But when Riku opens her eyes to see who kissed her, Dark has already transformed back to Daisuke.The fourth episode introduces us to Dark's doppelganer, Krad (who looks like a blonde version of Dark, with white clothing and white wings) and despite the color of their wings, Dark calls Krad a devil with the face of an angel.  And we get to see the two go face off against each other!The first volume of D.N.Angel is very exciting because the quality of animation is superb and to think that this is a TV series, the animation looks awesome and you will be impressed when you watch it on your television.  Very well done!The voice acting in Japanese and also the English dub are also very well done.And to top things off are the special features available on this first volume.Included on the special features are the clean opening and closing themes, voice actor commentary by two of the English dub voice actors who play Dark and Daisuke, the Japanese promo, Japanese TV spots and also the creation of the opening theme which was cool to watch.As we approach the end of 2004,  I was very pleased with the quality of D.N.Angel.The animation, the well-written storyline and the good voice acting thus far surpassed my expectations that I had for this series.I can't say how much I really dig the character designs and as mentioned, the animation, music, and storyline.  It all meshes very well together and the result makes me craving for more.  It's that good!""D.N.Angel"" is one of the few anime TV series released on DVD in 2004 that has hooked me and caught my attention from the get go.  I highly recommend checking this anime series out!  It's all good!",4,THE PHANTOM THIEF,1218585600,"08 13, 2008",2008,3685,"['COOL', 'was', 'first', 'impression', 'when', 'looking', 'character', 'DVD', 'cover', 'first', 'volume', 'D.N.Angel', '.I', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'D.N.Angel', 'usually', 'when', 'are', 'cool', 'character', 'designs', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'anime', 'series', 'anime', 'fans', ""'m"", 'proud', 'say', 'D.N.Angel', 'not', 'disappoint', 'definitely', 'series', 'checking', 'out', 'storyline', 'teenager', 'named', 'Daisuke', 'Niwa', 'been', 'receiving', 'stealth', 'training', 'mother', 'grandfather', 'whole', 'life', 'really', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'doing', 'it.Daisuke', 'big', 'crush', 'girl', 'named', 'Risa', 'kick', 'off', '14th', 'birthday', 'prepared', 'let', 'know', 'her.Unfortunately', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'friend.Daisuke', 'not', 'exactly', 'having', 'great', 'birthday', 'unbeknownst', 'surprise', 'waiting', 'new', '14-year-old.All', 'training', 'learned', 'was', 'next', 'person', 'family', 'line', '40', 'years', 'be', 'host', 'legendary', 'phantom', 'thief', 'known', 'Dark.It', 'DNA', 'whenever', 'desire', 'Risa', 'even', 'photo', 'Daisuke', 'will', 'transform', 'Dark', 'family', 'immediately', 'missions', 'steal', 'artifact.Of', 'course', 'Daisuke', 'only', 'be', 'normal', 'teen', 'last', 'thing', 'become', 'phantom', 'thief', 'Dark.One', 'reason', 'when', 'Dark', 'Dark', 'somewhat', 'playboy', 'who', 'eyes', 'set', 'Risa', 'poor', 'Daisuke', 'recollection', 'even', 'happening', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'Risa', 'falled', 'love', 'Dark.This', 'up', 'storyline', 'D.N.Angel', 'complicated', 'love', 'triangle', 'interesting', 'characters', 'reminiscent', 'one', 'favorite', 'mid-90', 'TV', 'anime', 'series', 'DNA^2', '.The', 'next', 'two', 'episodes', 'feature', 'Daisuke/Dark', 'missions', 'steal', 'more', 'artifacts', 'also', 'love', 'triangle', 'Daisuke', 'Dark', 'Risa.But', 'things', 'get', 'bit', 'more', 'complicated', 'first', 'episode', 'when', 'Dark', 'up', 'kissing', 'Risa', 'older', 'twin', 'sister', 'Riku', 'when', 'Riku', 'eyes', 'see', 'who', 'kissed', 'Dark', 'already', 'transformed', 'back', 'Daisuke.The', 'fourth', 'episode', 'introduces', 'Dark', 'doppelganer', 'Krad', 'who', 'blonde', 'version', 'Dark', 'white', 'clothing', 'white', 'wings', 'color', 'wings', 'Dark', 'Krad', 'devil', 'face', 'angel', 'get', 'see', 'two', 'go', 'face', 'off', 'other', 'first', 'volume', 'D.N.Angel', 'very', 'exciting', 'quality', 'animation', 'superb', 'think', 'TV', 'series', 'animation', 'awesome', 'will', 'be', 'impressed', 'when', 'watch', 'television', 'Very', 'well', 'done', 'voice', 'acting', 'Japanese', 'also', 'English', 'dub', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done.And', 'top', 'things', 'off', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'available', 'first', 'volume.Included', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'clean', 'opening', 'closing', 'themes', 'voice', 'actor', 'commentary', 'two', 'English', 'dub', 'voice', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Dark', 'Daisuke', 'Japanese', 'promo', 'Japanese', 'TV', 'spots', 'also', 'creation', 'opening', 'theme', 'was', 'cool', 'watch.As', 'approach', 'end', '2004', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'quality', 'D.N.Angel.The', 'animation', 'well-written', 'storyline', 'good', 'voice', 'acting', 'thus', 'far', 'surpassed', 'expectations', 'had', 'series.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'dig', 'character', 'designs', 'as', 'mentioned', 'animation', 'music', 'storyline', 'meshes', 'very', 'well', 'together', 'result', 'craving', 'more', 'good', 'D.N.Angel', 'one', 'few', 'anime', 'TV', 'series', 'released', 'DVD', '2004', 'hooked', 'caught', 'attention', 'get', 'go', 'highly', 'recommend', 'checking', 'anime', 'series', 'good']",D.N.

D.N.Angel was in fact one of my favorites. It starts off with a boy named Daisuke Niwa and how he is introduced into the story. The beginning may throw people off because no one knows exactly whats happening, but as you watch later on you will understand. Niwa happens to fall in love with the younger of the two Harada's. Since Risa doesn't return his love Niwa now becomes Dark because thats part of his D.N.A. Her sister Riku isn't a bad character as well because she just happens to like Niwa and I won't say anymore otherwise I'll end up spoiling the whole dvd.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","All teenagers go through a lot of difficult changes... but Daisuke Niwa's are a little different.And a family legacy becomes quite a burden in ""D.N. Angel - The Dawn of Dark,"" which brings together the first four episodes of this atmospheric anime series. It's a lushly-animated story full of black feathers, shining buildings and shadowy museums -- and while the titular character is not terribly likable at first, the mixture of shy first romance, fantasy and action is quite good.For every male of the Niwa family, the fourteenth birthday brings a curse -- their body will turn into Dark Mousy, the phantom thief, every time their feelings of romantic love are stirred.So as you can guess, Daisuke's birthday is an unmitigated disaster -- not only has pretty, shallow Risa rejected him, but he suddenly morphs into Dark. His eccentric grandfather and mother send him off to steal a priceless sculpture from a local museum, where he's almost captured by his icy classmate Satoshi Hiwatari -- until Dark's flirty, devilish personality takes over. Even worse, Risa falls in love with Dark, and Dark smooches her identical twin sister Rika.And Daisuke's problems aren't over, since his family expects him to keep stealing artwork -- a golden bird plaque that is flying free at night, and a magical painting that is luring children into itself. But the biggest danger comes from Hiwatari, whose entire life revolves around capturing Dark -- and who hides a terrible secret of his own that could spell doom for both Daisuke and Dark.For the record, ""DNAngel"" is a really visually stunning series -- it all takes place in a sunny seaside village, and is filled with tornadoes of feathers, shimmering gilded clock faces, broken statues, tarot cards, winged men in flowing coats, delicate sculptures, and luminous light-filled windows. Since the series is all about a ""phantom thief,"" it adds a magical air to the entire story without being too heavy-handed about it.The writing is fairly solid, with lots of hair-raising, clever stunts to capture various artworks, shy teenage romance, and very muted humor. The third episode is rather slow and sugary (a UNICORN?), but the rest of the stories are beautiful and bizarre stories -- and there are hints of something weirder going on, and an old enemy of Dark's that is making things even more complex. In fact the fourth episode, in which Hiwatari's secrets are revealed during a stint in a walk-in freezer, is pure brilliance from start to finish.Daisuke and Dark make good protagonists, since they're two sides of the same coin -- one is a nice naive kid with a knack for avoiding deathtraps, and the other is an elusive, devil-may-care flirt. Dark isn't terribly sympathetic just yet, but there are hints that he's more than he appears. As for Hiwatari, he's also something of a dark horse -- he's on the hunt for Dark, but seems to be befriending Daisuke. Awkward.""DNAngel - The Dawn of Dark"" is a solid introduction to this lush anime, even if the third episode drags badly. Still, it's a lovely start with some intriguing questions raised.",4,Dark wings,1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,3088,"['teenagers', 'go', 'lot', 'difficult', 'changes', 'Daisuke', 'Niwa', 'are', 'little', 'different.And', 'family', 'legacy', 'quite', 'burden', 'D.N', 'Angel', 'Dawn', 'Dark', 'together', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'atmospheric', 'anime', 'series', 'lushly-animated', 'story', 'full', 'black', 'feathers', 'shining', 'buildings', 'shadowy', 'museums', 'titular', 'character', 'not', 'terribly', 'likable', 'first', 'mixture', 'shy', 'first', 'romance', 'fantasy', 'action', 'quite', 'good.For', 'male', 'Niwa', 'family', 'fourteenth', 'birthday', 'curse', 'body', 'will', 'turn', 'Dark', 'Mousy', 'phantom', 'thief', 'time', 'feelings', 'romantic', 'love', 'are', 'stirred.So', 'can', 'guess', 'Daisuke', 'birthday', 'unmitigated', 'disaster', 'not', 'only', 'pretty', 'shallow', 'Risa', 'rejected', 'suddenly', 'Dark', 'eccentric', 'grandfather', 'mother', 'send', 'off', 'steal', 'priceless', 'sculpture', 'local', 'museum', 'where', 'almost', 'captured', 'icy', 'classmate', 'Satoshi', 'Hiwatari', 'Dark', 'flirty', 'devilish', 'personality', 'Even', 'worse', 'Risa', 'love', 'Dark', 'Dark', 'identical', 'twin', 'sister', 'Rika.And', 'Daisuke', 'problems', 'are', ""n't"", 'family', 'keep', 'stealing', 'artwork', 'golden', 'bird', 'plaque', 'flying', 'free', 'night', 'magical', 'painting', 'luring', 'children', 'biggest', 'danger', 'Hiwatari', 'entire', 'life', 'revolves', 'capturing', 'Dark', 'who', 'terrible', 'secret', 'own', 'could', 'spell', 'doom', 'Daisuke', 'Dark.For', 'record', 'DNAngel', 'really', 'visually', 'stunning', 'series', 'place', 'sunny', 'seaside', 'village', 'filled', 'tornadoes', 'feathers', 'shimmering', 'gilded', 'clock', 'broken', 'statues', 'tarot', 'cards', 'winged', 'men', 'flowing', 'coats', 'delicate', 'sculptures', 'luminous', 'light-filled', 'windows', 'series', 'phantom', 'thief', 'magical', 'air', 'entire', 'story', 'being', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'it.The', 'writing', 'fairly', 'solid', 'lots', 'hair-raising', 'clever', 'stunts', 'capture', 'various', 'artworks', 'shy', 'teenage', 'romance', 'very', 'muted', 'humor', 'third', 'episode', 'rather', 'slow', 'sugary', 'UNICORN', 'rest', 'stories', 'are', 'beautiful', 'bizarre', 'stories', 'are', 'hints', 'something', 'weirder', 'going', 'old', 'enemy', 'Dark', 'making', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'fact', 'fourth', 'episode', 'Hiwatari', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'stint', 'walk-in', 'freezer', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'start', 'finish.Daisuke', 'Dark', 'make', 'good', 'protagonists', ""'re"", 'two', 'sides', 'same', 'coin', 'one', 'nice', 'naive', 'kid', 'knack', 'avoiding', 'deathtraps', 'other', 'elusive', 'devil-may-care', 'flirt', 'Dark', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'sympathetic', 'just', 'yet', 'are', 'hints', 'more', 'Hiwatari', 'also', 'something', 'dark', 'horse', 'hunt', 'Dark', 'be', 'befriending', 'Daisuke', 'Awkward', 'DNAngel', 'Dawn', 'Dark', 'solid', 'introduction', 'lush', 'anime', 'even', 'third', 'episode', 'drags', 'badly', 'Still', 'lovely', 'start', 'intriguing', 'questions', 'raised']",D.N.

His training is preparing him for the life of a thief. He has inherited the genes of the master thief, Phantom Dark. He can change into his alter ego at will when he needs the extra power and skill. He's not that thrilled about a high profile life of crime. Daisuke would rather focus on his crush toward classmate Risa. His arch rival in love is his alter ego. You see, Risa is infatuated with Phantom Dark. She cares very much for Daisuke, but she thinks of him as a best friend type of guy. Now the solution to this problem seems obvious to me. He should reveal to Risa that he is both Daisuke and Phantom Dark. But if he did that, we wouldn't have much of an anime series would we.This series has a very charming atmosphere. It's set in a Mediterranean style town. The music is fitting, but could be a little better. I like the animation and the voice acting quite a lot.

It contains four episodes, which are called ""stages"" in this anime.  The stages are titled: ""Dark Revived,"" ""Rekindled Feelings,"" ""Whisper of the Unicorn,"" and ""Between the Light and the Darkness."" All episodes in this volume flow more or less as one long movie, so there is no need to explain them separately.  DNAngel is the story of young, short, shy, Daisuke Niwa.  Daisuke is in love with cute Risa, who has no idea he has a crush on her.  On his 14th birthday, Daisuke learns his family's secret: that he is the bearer of the identity of tall, dashing, winged Phantom Thief Dark.The setting for DNAngel is a seaside villa in Europe.  The town police have received a warning letter that Dark is about to make his first appearance in forty years.  Dark steals the hearts of young ladies in addition to artifacts.  One big problem is that Dark has also stolen the heart of Risa!  On his way back from a mission (given to him by his mother and grandfather), he accidentally runs into the twin of Risa, with unforseen consequences for all.Daisuke has someone dogging him at school - Satoshi Hiwatari. Could it be Satoshi knows Daisuke's secret?  And why does Satoshi seem so malicious?

857510,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B00062IZT0,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[9, 9]","This new entry in the youth oriented segment of the anime market tells the story of Daisuke Niwa, a young, somewhat clutzy boy, who happens to be in love. One his 14th birthday Daisuke sets out, determined to finally announce his affection to Risa Harada and ask her for a date. But fate intervenes in the form of Daisuke's mother, Emiko, and his grandfather Daiki. Not in the way families usually discourage dating, though, Instead, Emiko and Daiki plan to ressurect the legendary thief Dark Mousey who will share Daisuke's body.This isn't really ill intentioned, but having Dark, who is cool wherever Daisuke is not, as an alter-ego comes with a whole set of problems. Not the least of these is that every time he gets emotional about Risa, Daisuke changes into Dark. To make matters worse, Risa thinks of Daisuke as a good friend, but she is attracted to Dark. And then there is Satoshi Hiwari - Supposedly Daisuke's friend, Satoshi is really a police agent intent on bringing Dark to Justice. Things get even more complicated when Krad (Dark's real antagonist) makes his appearance.While this is played lightly (especially by the US actors) thise complicated plot mechanism is the means whereby Daisuke comes of age. Rather than flee from Dark's influence, the young boy embraces his 'Dark side,' and the ensuing drame enables him to come to an richer understanding of himself.This only real hitch is, as other reviewers have noted the dubbing is sophomoric, with the Japanese taking the story much more seriously. This is another time when I recommend turning on the subtitles and taking your emotional cues from the Japanese acting. But from a story and artistic viewpoint, D.N.Angel is worth watching.",4,Of Two Minds,1103155200,"12 16, 2004",2004,1708,"['new', 'entry', 'youth', 'oriented', 'segment', 'anime', 'market', 'story', 'Daisuke', 'Niwa', 'young', 'somewhat', 'clutzy', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'love', 'One', '14th', 'birthday', 'Daisuke', 'out', 'determined', 'finally', 'announce', 'affection', 'Risa', 'Harada', 'ask', 'date', 'fate', 'intervenes', 'form', 'Daisuke', 'mother', 'Emiko', 'grandfather', 'Daiki', 'Not', 'way', 'families', 'usually', 'discourage', 'dating', 'though', 'Instead', 'Emiko', 'Daiki', 'plan', 'ressurect', 'legendary', 'thief', 'Dark', 'Mousey', 'who', 'will', 'share', 'Daisuke', 'body.This', ""n't"", 'really', 'ill', 'intentioned', 'having', 'Dark', 'who', 'cool', 'wherever', 'Daisuke', 'not', 'alter-ego', 'whole', 'set', 'problems', 'Not', 'least', 'time', 'emotional', 'Risa', 'Daisuke', 'Dark', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Risa', 'Daisuke', 'good', 'friend', 'attracted', 'Dark', 'then', 'Satoshi', 'Hiwari', 'Supposedly', 'Daisuke', 'friend', 'Satoshi', 'really', 'police', 'agent', 'intent', 'bringing', 'Dark', 'Justice', 'Things', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'when', 'Krad', 'Dark', 'real', 'antagonist', 'appearance.While', 'played', 'lightly', 'especially', 'US', 'actors', 'thise', 'complicated', 'plot', 'mechanism', 'means', 'whereby', 'Daisuke', 'age', 'Rather', 'flee', 'Dark', 'influence', 'young', 'boy', ""'Dark"", 'side', 'ensuing', 'drame', 'come', 'richer', 'understanding', 'himself.This', 'only', 'real', 'hitch', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'dubbing', 'sophomoric', 'Japanese', 'taking', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'seriously', 'time', 'when', 'recommend', 'turning', 'subtitles', 'taking', 'emotional', 'cues', 'Japanese', 'acting', 'story', 'artistic', 'viewpoint', 'D.N.Angel', 'worth', 'watching']",D.N.

He's a pretty boy but I find him repugnant. This is only fangirl material not something  animation fans would enjoy. I love shoujo but I recommend Snow Fairy Sugar over this rubbish. This show is rather cheesy and the romance is quite corny and sickening. It's about this loser named Daisuke who turns into Dark due to his feelings for some silly girl named Risa Harada who doesn't return his feelings. This girly is giggly silly over that heartbreaker Dark. Riku who in my opinion is the better of the Harada sisters. She is a grating character too but tolerable compared to her uber annoying sister Risa. In fact I wish Daisuke and Dark ended up  dead and Risa with them. This show is repetitive and cornier than Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura combined.
