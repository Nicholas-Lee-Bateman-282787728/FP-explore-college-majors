While the premise and execution are blatantly different, the movie didn't leave me with a nasty sense that I expected.  Taking place in the deep South, we have a pervading atmosphere of oppressive heat.  The film immediately introduces us to the Blues with Son House filmed in black and white expounding how love will have us ""hide all fault"" and suffer from ""...sad blues..."".In the next scene we find Rae (Christina Ricci in a riveting performance) and Ronnie (Justin Timberlake with an excellent performance) in a steamy love scene.  Soon he's going off to the army, leaving her in great need from his absence.  On the other side of town associate preacher ""Laz"" Lazarus (Samuel Jackson in an effective departure) is dumped by his wife in a difficult discussion that takes place in a public cafe' and ends in an argument.  Going back and forth we see how Rae and Laz each disintegrate until they cross paths.  She has serial sexual encounters, and Laz sinks deep into the blues, both musically and spiritually.  He doesn't attend church and confronts Angela's new love interest at the pool hall.  One night while boozing, Rae encounters Ronnie's best friend who is gentlemanly enough to take her home, but turns violent when she drunkenly mocks his manhood.  Left unconscious on the roadside, she is lucky enough to be alive and close to Laz's farmhouse.  In the morning he finds her and takes her in his house and reduces her fever.  She is so delirious that she becomes a danger to herself, so he does the unthinkable:  He shackles her with chains to keep her from running away.  In the following scenes he tries to sermonize her with senior pastor, Rev. R.L. (John Cothran), while assisting her recovery.  In his own way he helps to restore her feminine dignity and bring her back to life.'Black Snake Moan' is such a worthy departure from most movies.  It's also refreshing to see Samuel Jackson in such a different role than previous ventures.  The movie's thrust is toward our universal craving for love and acceptance and coming to terms with our weaknesses.  Although certainly more than a modern update of 'My Fair Lady,' 'Black Snake Moan' lays on the line the lust to love transcendence we all seek.",4,Some Have It Hot,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,2279,"['thought', 'watching', ""'Black"", 'Snake', 'Moan', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'ordeal', 'premise', 'execution', 'are', 'blatantly', 'different', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'nasty', 'sense', 'expected', 'Taking', 'place', 'deep', 'South', 'have', 'pervading', 'atmosphere', 'oppressive', 'heat', 'film', 'immediately', 'Blues', 'Son', 'House', 'filmed', 'black', 'white', 'expounding', 'how', 'love', 'will', 'have', 'hide', 'fault', 'suffer', 'sad', 'blues', 'next', 'scene', 'find', 'Rae', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'riveting', 'performance', 'Ronnie', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'excellent', 'performance', 'steamy', 'love', 'scene', 'Soon', 'going', 'off', 'army', 'leaving', 'great', 'need', 'absence', 'other', 'side', 'town', 'associate', 'preacher', 'Laz', 'Lazarus', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'effective', 'departure', 'dumped', 'wife', 'difficult', 'discussion', 'place', 'public', 'cafe', 'ends', 'argument', 'Going', 'back', 'forth', 'see', 'how', 'Rae', 'Laz', 'disintegrate', 'cross', 'paths', 'serial', 'sexual', 'encounters', 'Laz', 'sinks', 'deep', 'blues', 'musically', 'spiritually', ""n't"", 'attend', 'church', 'confronts', 'Angela', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'pool', 'hall', 'One', 'night', 'boozing', 'Rae', 'Ronnie', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'gentlemanly', 'enough', 'take', 'home', 'violent', 'when', 'drunkenly', 'manhood', 'Left', 'unconscious', 'roadside', 'lucky', 'enough', 'be', 'alive', 'close', 'Laz', 'farmhouse', 'morning', 'house', 'fever', 'so', 'delirious', 'danger', 'herself', 'unthinkable', 'chains', 'keep', 'running', 'away', 'following', 'scenes', 'sermonize', 'senior', 'pastor', 'Rev', 'R.L', 'John', 'Cothran', 'assisting', 'recovery', 'own', 'way', 'restore', 'feminine', 'dignity', 'bring', 'back', 'life', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'such', 'worthy', 'departure', 'most', 'movies', 'also', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'such', 'different', 'role', 'previous', 'ventures', 'movie', 'thrust', 'universal', 'craving', 'love', 'acceptance', 'coming', 'terms', 'weaknesses', 'certainly', 'more', 'modern', 'update', ""'My"", 'Fair', 'Lady', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'lays', 'line', 'lust', 'love', 'transcendence', 'seek']",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]
646396,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B00005JP97,Alistair McHarg,"[11, 15]","Black Snake Moan isn't awful, but it didn't miss by much.  Two fine performances, Ricci and Jackson, stop the bleeding.  The blame for BSM belongs entirely to Craig Brewer who wrote and directed.  Many of you will recall his earlier effort, Hustle & Flow, starring Terrence Howard as Djay, the pimp who couldn't slap straight.  I don't know about you, but as far as I'm concerned, no matter how hard it is out there for a pimp, it's not hard enough.  Hustle & Flow, despite a brilliant performance by Howard, was poorly conceived and very badly written.BSN is just as ludicrous, but Brewer has cleverly reversed some cliches.  Rae, Ricci, is a sex addict, while Lazarus, Jackson, is morally upright, fighting demons.  When he chains her to his radiator - a slight, sexually charged white woman imprisoned by a large, imposing black man - the overtones of America's colorful past are loud.  Most notable of all about this film is Ms. Ricci's body.  After growing chubbier and chubbier apparently she has taken the bull by the horns and gone to one of those top-secret Hollywood fat farms.  She looks fantastic.  So much so that she must have had a clause written into her contract specifying that at least 90% of her on screen minutes be spent showing at least 80% of her skin.  I'm not complaining but - enough already - you got the job!For a film with a blues song as a title, and bonus features of Sun House, BSM gets low grades for music.  With a show of hubris quite common today, Jackson actually sings and plays guitar, Ricci sings as well.  This obnoxious arrogance calls to mind an obvious question - When was the last time you saw the Funkadelics perform Shakespeare in the park?  From Walk The Line to Ray and so many others, actors feel qualified to sing, it's a mystery.  Another puzzle is the highly charged name, Lazarus.  While the biblical reference is obvious, surely Mr. Brewer knows the rule for naming blues musicians.  After all, the song, Black Snake Moan, was recorded by Blind Lemon Jefferson in 1927.  (Infirmity-Fruit-Name of President).  A name like Gimpy Kumquat Taft would have served admirably.Justin Timberlake is less horrible than one would expect (whew!) while S. Epatha Merkerson is wonderful as always.  The third act, the resolution, is appallingly facile.  Ricci is an amazing actress, she has a lot of room to work, and she shines.  Jackson is blessed with on screen gravitas; he holds your attention throughout.  If you can ignore the poor direction and sheer stupidity of the story, you'll enjoy the picture.",3,Chained To The Radiator Blues,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,2549,"['Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', ""n't"", 'awful', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'much', 'Two', 'fine', 'performances', 'Ricci', 'Jackson', 'stop', 'bleeding', 'blame', 'BSM', 'belongs', 'entirely', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'who', 'wrote', 'directed', 'Many', 'will', 'recall', 'earlier', 'effort', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'starring', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Djay', 'pimp', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'slap', 'straight', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'out', 'there', 'pimp', 'not', 'hard', 'enough', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Howard', 'was', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'very', 'badly', 'written.BSN', 'just', 'as', 'ludicrous', 'Brewer', 'cleverly', 'reversed', 'cliches', 'Rae', 'Ricci', 'sex', 'addict', 'Lazarus', 'Jackson', 'morally', 'upright', 'fighting', 'demons', 'When', 'radiator', 'slight', 'sexually', 'charged', 'white', 'woman', 'imprisoned', 'large', 'imposing', 'black', 'man', 'overtones', 'America', 'colorful', 'past', 'are', 'loud', 'Most', 'notable', 'film', 'Ms.', 'Ricci', 'body', 'growing', 'chubbier', 'chubbier', 'apparently', 'taken', 'bull', 'horns', 'gone', 'one', 'top-secret', 'Hollywood', 'fat', 'farms', 'fantastic', 'So', 'much', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'clause', 'written', 'contract', 'specifying', 'least', '90', '%', 'screen', 'minutes', 'be', 'spent', 'showing', 'least', '80', '%', 'skin', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'enough', 'already', 'got', 'job', 'film', 'blues', 'song', 'title', 'bonus', 'features', 'Sun', 'House', 'BSM', 'low', 'grades', 'music', 'show', 'hubris', 'quite', 'common', 'today', 'Jackson', 'actually', 'sings', 'plays', 'guitar', 'Ricci', 'as', 'well', 'obnoxious', 'arrogance', 'mind', 'obvious', 'question', 'When', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'Funkadelics', 'perform', 'Shakespeare', 'park', 'Line', 'Ray', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'actors', 'feel', 'qualified', 'sing', 'mystery', 'puzzle', 'highly', 'charged', 'name', 'Lazarus', 'biblical', 'reference', 'obvious', 'surely', 'Mr', 'Brewer', 'rule', 'naming', 'blues', 'musicians', 'song', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'was', 'recorded', 'Blind', 'Lemon', 'Jefferson', '1927', 'Infirmity-Fruit-Name', 'President', 'name', 'Gimpy', 'Kumquat', 'Taft', 'would', 'have', 'served', 'admirably.Justin', 'Timberlake', 'less', 'horrible', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'whew', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Merkerson', 'wonderful', 'always', 'third', 'act', 'resolution', 'appallingly', 'facile', 'Ricci', 'amazing', 'actress', 'lot', 'room', 'work', 'shines', 'Jackson', 'blessed', 'screen', 'gravitas', 'attention', 'can', 'ignore', 'poor', 'direction', 'sheer', 'stupidity', 'story', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'picture']",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]
646397,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B00005JP97,Amanda Richards,"[10, 12]","For a movie packed with graphic imagery, infused with heart-thumping blues music, and then generously splattered with raw emotion, the plot of Black Snake Moan is remarkably simple.Samuel L. Jackson plays Lazarus, a Tennessee farmer and former blues guitarist whose wife takes off with his brother for some good times.  Naturally he doesn't take the news very well, but before he can even come to grips with his loss, he finds a badly beaten young girl (Christina Ricci, who seems to thrive on challenging roles) dumped on the roadway near his house.  Strange as it may seem, being beaten and left for dead are just two of Rae's problems, as her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) has just left to join the National Guard, leaving her out of sync and all alone with her regular attacks of nymphomania.Lazarus knows that calling the sheriff could result in some unpleasant interrogation based purely on skin color, so being a religious man, he does the Good Samaritan thing and does his best to help Rae, both physically and mentally.  The thing is, when Rae gets her attacks, she's inclined to go running wildly away from the house, and so Lazarus decides to restrain her with chains, which actually sounds a lot kinkier than it actually is.  Obviously this is not an ideal situation, and it gets worse when Ronnie returns home unexpectedly.Extremely well acted by both leads, with more than acceptable Blues renditions by Jackson, and even the deer-in-the-headlights performance by Timberlake wasn't that bad, given the character he plays.  Not recommended for below 17 yrs, due to violence, profanity, graphic scenes and the fact that Timberlake leaves the singing to Jackson.Amanda Richards, September 3, 2007",4,Lazarus comes forth,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,1714,"['movie', 'packed', 'graphic', 'imagery', 'infused', 'heart-thumping', 'blues', 'music', 'then', 'generously', 'splattered', 'raw', 'emotion', 'plot', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'remarkably', 'simple.Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Lazarus', 'Tennessee', 'farmer', 'former', 'blues', 'guitarist', 'wife', 'off', 'brother', 'good', 'times', 'Naturally', ""n't"", 'take', 'news', 'very', 'well', 'can', 'even', 'come', 'grips', 'loss', 'badly', 'beaten', 'young', 'girl', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'who', 'thrive', 'challenging', 'roles', 'dumped', 'roadway', 'house', 'may', 'seem', 'being', 'beaten', 'left', 'dead', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'Rae', 'problems', 'boyfriend', 'Ronnie', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'just', 'left', 'join', 'National', 'Guard', 'leaving', 'out', 'sync', 'alone', 'regular', 'attacks', 'nymphomania.Lazarus', 'knows', 'calling', 'sheriff', 'could', 'result', 'unpleasant', 'interrogation', 'based', 'purely', 'skin', 'color', 'so', 'being', 'religious', 'man', 'Good', 'Samaritan', 'thing', 'best', 'help', 'Rae', 'physically', 'mentally', 'thing', 'when', 'Rae', 'attacks', 'inclined', 'go', 'running', 'wildly', 'away', 'house', 'so', 'Lazarus', 'restrain', 'chains', 'actually', 'lot', 'kinkier', 'actually', 'Obviously', 'not', 'ideal', 'situation', 'worse', 'when', 'Ronnie', 'home', 'unexpectedly.Extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'leads', 'more', 'acceptable', 'Blues', 'renditions', 'Jackson', 'even', 'deer-in-the-headlights', 'performance', 'Timberlake', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'given', 'character', 'Not', 'recommended', '17', 'yrs', 'due', 'violence', 'profanity', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'fact', 'Timberlake', 'singing', 'Jackson.Amanda', 'Richards', 'September', '3', '2007']",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]

Burnside and the North Mississippi Allstars. the NMA contribute to the soundtrack, and most, if not all of the songs sung by Samuel T. Jackson (who does a great job) are R.L. Burnside songs. Just the fact that a filmmaker is honoring the music of the under-heralded R.L. Burnside is enough to deserve a five-star rating. Burnside's sidemen (including his grandson Cedric) appear in the film to accompany Jackson's performances, adding authenticity to the music.And what the hey, the movie ends overall on a pretty good note, so some of the ""dirtiness"" you might feel watching this film should disappear by the end!Living and singing the blues was never all peaches and cream, hence the dark tones in this flick--just makes it all bluesier!

Yes, Jackson bathes and clothes her, but he is, fundamentally, a moral man, and he tells the minister of the local church exactly what he is doing, asking for guidance.So, potential viewer, if you want soft porn, look elsewhere...or better yet, BUY this; you may discover something far more worthwhile than you bargained for!Kudos to writer/director Craig Brewer, and his extraordinary cast!",5,"Beyond the Titillation, a Beautiful Tale of Healing...",1186531200,"08 8, 2007",2007,1398,"['buying', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'simply', 'see', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'nude', 'bondage', 'will', 'certainly', 'find', 'film', ""n't"", 'about', 'sleaze', 'healing', 'how', 'anyone', 'can', 'change', 'lives', 'love', 'patience', 'respect', 'message', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'film', 'titillation', 'story', 'tells', 'three', 'souls', 'bitter', 'ex-blues', 'singer/farmer', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'coping', 'wife', 'running', 'away', 'brother', 'young', 'nymphomaniac', 'Ricci', 'uncontrollable', 'carnal', 'result', 'being', 'raped', 'repeatedly', 'child', 'young', 'soldier', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'rendered', 'nearly', 'helpless', 'anxiety', 'attacks', 'three', ""'lost"", 'souls', 'are', 'labeled', 'dismissed', 'small', 'southern', 'community', 'live', 'other', 'will', 'find', 'healing', 'ultimately', 'redemption.Yes', 'Ricci', 'chained', 'Jackson', ""n't"", 'sexual', 'gesture', 'keep', 'returning', 'environment', 'had', 'left', 'bloodied', 'unconscious', 'when', 'first', 'found', 'Yes', 'Jackson', 'bathes', 'clothes', 'fundamentally', 'moral', 'man', 'minister', 'local', 'church', 'exactly', 'what', 'doing', 'asking', 'guidance.So', 'potential', 'viewer', 'want', 'soft', 'porn', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'better', 'yet', 'BUY', 'may', 'discover', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'bargained', 'Kudos', 'writer/director', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'extraordinary', 'cast']",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]

646405,A3FMZGLC0XBU64,B00005JP97,bharring,"[2, 2]","I'm surprised at the number of rave reviews this movie received not because I didn't enjoy it but because it really walks the line in terms of the definition of poor taste. Christina Ricci as the sexually abused and sexually compulsive Rae does spend an awful lot of time writhing around scantily-clad in the grips of post-traumatic stress and has sex with 3-4 different men in the first half-hour of the film. Furthermore, the one man who doesn't want to have sex with her, the dumped and drinking bluesman Lazarus as played by Samuel (there-are-mutha-f**kin-snakes-on-the...) L. Jackson, keeps her confined in his house with a long, black chain. However, perhaps it is the fact that BLACK SNAKE MOAN is so blatant about it's exploitative qualities that saves it from becoming utterly distasteful. Instead, the tale that unfolds on the screen is one of trauma, trust, redemption for two souls, helped along by by the soothing balm of blues music.One aspect that I would like to commend this film for is its (in my opinion) nearly complete transcendence of the issue of race. That Lazarus was black and Rae was white was only a minor detail to the film. Perhaps it is simply because Lazarus and Rae are so different on so many levels: him--old, morose, alcoholic, and neglected and her: young, manic, traumatized, and sexually compulsive, that black/white is not really a noticeable factor and ultimately it is their similarities, their sense of hurt and need to heal that bring them together.Among the few weaknesses I could name in the film are some features of the ending. The reverend's role and the sort of therapy session that ensued seemed weak as though the producers had run out of ideas or didn't want to do anything too risky and thus went for the mundane ending. Perhaps my dislike of the ending is also because of the heavy presence of Justin Timberlake. I'm not a fan of JT as a character and personally felt that his acting abilities were weak and that his presence detracted from the point that I thought the producers were trying to make with his character. Rather than seeing Ronnie as a sufferer of panic attacks (taboo for a male), I found myself thinking, ""Figures, Justin Timberlake would wimp out of military service."" On the other hand, I suppose it's better for him to throw his weight and celebrity status behind a movie like this rather than starring in some absurd ""romantic comedy"" with Jessica Simpson. For that, I commend him.All-in-all, Black Snake Moan was a very enjoyable movie that tackled a variety of different subjects in an appealing yet controversial way.

Jackson chains a half-naked Christina Ricci to a radiator; and although any movie that includes such a scene is probably asking for it, it would be all too short-sighted of anyone to limit an explanation of this film to its more shocking elements.Writer/director Craig Brewer, of ""Hustle and Flow"" fame, is clearly going for 'memorable' with many of the films stuntier moments, but he clearly has more to say about self-control, free will, human kindness and redemption beneath the surface.Those who love bizarre and audacious films to begin with are sure to find plenty here to revel in, but if you are on the fence, as long as you are a movie goer who can handle something a little odd, a little twisted and a little out of the ordinary, I think you will find ""Black Snake Moan"" to be a heartfelt, truly original experience that manages to be a rare morality tale that avoids clich&eacute;s, sentimentality and easy answers.  It is highlighted by two terrific lead performances by Jackson and Ricci as full-blooded, fully realized characters, rather than the caricatures we get in standard, dumbed-down romantic comedy schlock that pander to cuteness over reality to audiences.

The film which could have been merely a lurid sexploitation film about a young nymphomaniac and the aging bluesman who attempts to heal her turns into an interesting if flawed exploration of the power of love and music to heal broken people.The films leads Samuel L.Jackson and Christina Ricci do surprisingly good work in this film. Ricci plays Rae with feeling and compassion. She gives a performance that allows her to break free from her usual roles and play a character that while hard to believe at times comes across as broken and likable. Jackson steps out of his usual tough guy role into that of bluesman Lazarus who makes it his job to save Rae. It is in his showing of unconditional love that he leans the power of music to heal.The disc I watched was standard definition but was quite good in both picture and sound quality. The musical score by Scott Bomar is quite good and reflects the blues roots of the source material.

These scenes truly go down with Scarlet O'Hara's ""with God as my witness"" and ""tomorrow is another day"" scenes from `Gone With the Wind' as the greatest in film history.`Black Snake Moan' is very effective as having the style and flow of an action movie with hardly any violence. The story itself is clearly a drama of the human character which combines the most sick and depraved of dark humor much like `Lolita'.Jackson gives the performance of his life as a simple Southern folk farmer whose wife has just run away with his own brother. He's at the lowest point in his life.Likewise Ricci is the result of a sexually abusive childhood and now lives as a drugged up nymphomaniac, literally sleeping with every man and boy she meets. The only stability in her life was her unstable boyfriend Justin Timberlake who has left town to join the army. (or the National Guard, it's unclear.)The two tragic characters come together by Jackson literally chaining Ricci to his farmhouse. Ricci spends 90% of the film in nothing but a cut up T shirt and barely there white panties.Forced to endure each other Jackson saves himself by saving Ricci and for the first time ever Ricci must survive without sex and drugs. But Jackson does provide her with rock and roll or blues.While blues music is emphasized heavily in the trailers it is only about 10% of the film and more of a side element to provide ear candy.The path to salvation is as narrow as a razor's edge. `Black Snake Moan' maintains its fast paced feel with eye candy and great directing while telling a rather simple but exciting story. ""Jackson chains almost naked Ricci to his farmhouse.""

First, let me start by saying, in my opinion, the title does not do justice to this movie. This movie is much, much better than the title implies. What can you say about Samuel L. Jackson, except he is brilliant and it shows in this movie. Not only did he do his own singing, as a guitar player myself, I am reasonably sure he did his own playing. He has already established himself as a very competent actor and this just put the icing on the cake. As for Christina Ricci, I have seen her in a few films and thought she did well, although Buffalo '66 was not a good choice for her. She was the best thing about that movie. Yeah, you get to see alot of Christina and she has come a long way from the Addams family movies. This is by far the best role I've seen her in and she took it to the max. I look forward to seeing her in more good roles in the future. If anyone has any doubt as to Justin Timberlake's transition from singer to acting, you can put those doubts aside. He showed that he was quite capable of handling a role. If he picks his roles carefully, I see a great future in acting for him. The Director was also the writer and what a story he told. There are some that would probably be put off by the racial aspects of the movie and that was part of the underlying story. This film deserved a better reception at the box office than what it apprantly received. It only played here for maybe two weeks. Again, I think the title probably hurt the film and the fact there was very little promo if any. This movie is well worth buying. Charlie S.

Rae (Christina Ricci) is the town slut, apparently afflicted with the ""disease"" of uncontrollable nymphomania. Rae, after a night of hard partying and sleeping around, is beaten up and left by the roadside near Lazarus' house. Lazarus takes her in and chains her to his radiator while trying to ""cure"" her insatiability. Eventually, the two become friends and help each other recover from their extremes of lust and piety to become more balanced individuals.To say the storyline of this movie is far fetched would be an understatement. But, then again, this film isn't trying to be realistic. Instead it's a odd combination of different elements - 70's exploitation flick, mythical parable and dark comedy - that tries to recouncile the needs of both the spirit and the flesh.The acting is excellent, it's depiction of the rural South is true to life and several scenes, such as Lazarus playing in a blues club, are well executed. But somehow the whole film just never came together for me. The plot meanders off in several directions without accomplishing much and the characters often seem more like symbols for the director's ""message"" than real human beings.Craig Brewer, who also made ""Hustle And Flow"", is clearly a talented filmaker. But, in this case, he seems to be trying to mix together too many different influences that don't quite work as a cohesive movie.

646420,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JP97,Chris Pandolfi,"[8, 10]","When I saw the first theatrical trailer for ""Black Snake Moan,"" my mind immediately reeled over what the story was about. The concept of a half naked young woman chained to a radiator can go in many different directions, not all of which would be beneficial to the story. Having actually seen the film, I now know that the filmmakers went in the right direction; this is a fascinating, darkly humorous, and surprisingly heartfelt film that creatively explores the relationships between certain people. Taking place in a rural Southern town, a wealth of complex issues hide behind a simplistic, stylized plot, a fact that only serves to strengthen its message. The story is not concerned with finding convenient solutions; the intention is to show how the characters learn to understand one another. If peace is made, great. If not, at least one knows where the other is coming from.I think the best thing about this movie is the main characters are neither good nor bad. They're portrayed realistically, deeply flawed yet not without redeeming qualities. We first meet Rae (Christina Ricci), an incredibly misguided young woman who periodically has bouts of nymphomania. She describes her condition near the end of the film; when she has a strange thought, it travels down her body as a burning sensation. Having been the victim of abuse as a child, her only method of relieving the pain is sexual contact. We periodically see her having an attack; she's bombarded with intense physical sensations, causing her to collapse and frantically touch every inch of her body. One gets the sense that she feels an unwelcome mixture of pain and pleasure.We then meet the God-fearing Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), a vegetable farmer who was once a blues musician. He's a broken man, having just split with his wife of twelve years (Adriane Lenox). We immediately understand how immature she is; she wants to leave him for his brother (Leonard L. Thomas) because he makes her feel young again. This leaves Lazarus feeling lost; not only did he provide for her as best he could, he also never raised a hand to her in anger (even when he was drinking). How could she be so unfeeling to someone who treated her well? He tries to find solace in alcohol, his Blues music, and the Good Book. But it's to no avail; even his friend, the Reverend R.L. (John Cothran, Jr.) isn't able to help.Then comes the fateful day when he crosses paths with Rae; he finds her lying in the middle of the road, barely dressed and beaten. She's also sick with pneumonia and under the influence of some heavy drugs, obtained the night before at a particularly wild party. For the next two days, Lazarus tries to care for Rae, who continuously slips in and out of consciousness (occasionally, she runs around the property, incoherently ranting and raving). While in town buying her some medicine, Lazarus learns of her promiscuous reputation, which prompts the release of his inner Dutiful Christian; God saw fit to send her to him, and because of that, he intends to cure her of her wickedness. He decides to tether her to his radiator with a long, sturdy chain.As you might expect, Rae isn't exactly thrilled when she finally comes to. She tries screaming for help. She tries running away. She tries enticing Lazarus with her body. But this is one household where potent sexuality will have no effect. Nor should it; Lazarus may be flawed, but he also understands that people should have more respect for themselves. This is something he's trying to instill in Rae, which would be admirable if only his method wasn't so unorthodox. Nonetheless, its obvious that he cares for her and that he's doing this to help, not hurt. Rae has always let men have their way with her; if she had a shred of dignity, she wouldn't allow herself to be used.As the film progresses, their relationship grows deeper, each one learning about the other's life. Lazarus eventually learns of Rae's boyfriend, Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), who leaves for the military early on in the film. It's quickly established that he's just as emotionally handicapped as Rae; he suffers crippling panic attacks when exposed to loud noises. It's also established that the two love each other deeply, despite Rae's sexual overdrive. By the end of the film, the audience will come to understand that the two were meant to be together, if not because they're dysfunctional, then because their dysfunctions complete each other. What an interesting relationship: when separated, their problems work against them, but when together, they function harmoniously.This is the kind of complexity that makes ""Black Snake Moan"" so engrossing. It helps that the film is perfectly cast, with each actor giving some of the most believable performances in recent memory. Jackson gives Lazarus a style that's both authoritative and compassionate. He's also makes him quite vulnerable, especially when he's around the kind-hearted Angela (S. Epatha Meckerson). Ricci does a wonderful job with Rae, perfectly balancing obvious sexuality with hidden insecurity. Timberlake shows terrific range as Ronnie, giving him a neurotic, strained edge that's matched only by his youthful naivety. All the characters add dimension to the story, something that effectively examines how the most unlikely people can leave lasting impressions. This is an original, finely crafted, well-acted film, and I definitely recommend it.",5,Chains of Love,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,5417,"['When', 'saw', 'first', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Black',

Memphis guy, Craig Brewer nailed it with his writing, direction and production staff. Ricci and Jackson are fearless and brilliant.  The performances play like a chamber piece.  I trust their instincts to invite me to explore some very dark, painful places of the human condition (except snakes on planes). I don't fancy movies about women being trapped by men anywhere, but Brewer and company turn that concept on its head with sex, the blues, drama, a lot of irony and even just simple humor.  Who knew Justin Timberlake could act? This movie deserves a lot of recognition from movie lovers.  It says a lot about the nature of fear, compassion and how a little inspiration (biblical or otherwise) can connect you to other people - or chaining them up.  (The radiator does not get as much credit, but it was just as important to the script as that chain.)  I love this movie because it is really crazy like a fox. Also, we get to see Jackson do something that he has never been allowed to be in other films. (Not spoiling this for people yet to watch.) Hustle and Flow, from the same creators, was OK in comparsion.  This work is in a better league.Take the time for the director's commentary.  Brewer poured a lot of love into Black Snake Moan.

All I saw was Samuel Jackson's character dragging Christina Ricci from a chain. It wasn't until I watched the movie from beginning to end that I realized it had a much deeper meaning behind it. Samuel L. Jackson's character, Lazarus, must overcome heartache after his wife leaves him for his brother.

646426,AODDKGNNV7AG2,B00005JP97,"Cult DVD Hunter ""Rico""","[1, 1]","When I first saw the trailer for this movie at my local theatre, I was intrigued.  The marketing department had done their job and established that Christina Ricci's character had a sexual addiction and after a rough night, ends up at Samuel L. Jackson's house.  What gripped the viewers was the twist: she's chained to the radiator and he won't let her go.I started wondering what the hell the movie could be about.  How were they going to develop an entire script (although I wondered the same thing about ""Saw"" before I saw it)?  Either way, I needed to see this film.Sadly, I don't recall seeing this movie in theatres at all (and I was loosely looking).  The trailer didn't give me a release date and before I knew it, here it is on DVD.  Now that I've seen the film, I must say that I am in love with it.  Unfortunately, judging from the progress of this film so far, it will die the sleeper film death and eventually only be known as an entry on ""Mr. Skin's"" web site because Ricci is topless multiple times throughout the movie.The plot develops like a well-laid plan.  We're never left in the dark too long, but we also aren't fed the plot and it's relatively unpredictable.  Jackson delivers a fantastic performance of an aged African-American living in a poor Southern town.  What is even more dynamic is that, while similar, it doesn't repeat his great performance in ""A Time To Kill"".  Ricci delviers another solid performance (recent films like ""Prozac Nation"", ""The Opposite of Sex"", and even ""Monster"" have been building on her talent).  She obviously lost a lot of weight for this role and the subsequent large sunken eyes compliment her character wonderfully.  It was difficult, at times, imagining the young girl who refused to be naked in ""The Opposite of Sex"" when faced with the lustful powerhouse she transformed herself into for this role.  Justin Timberlake also has a small role as Ricci's boyfriend and gives a tender and endearing performance.  I must say that Timberlake impressed the most, even though he was the weakest performance of the three.This movie combines trauma, sex, idiosyncracies, racism, and the wonderful tunes of the blues into a rough ride through one girl's struggle.  Your emotions will be on a roller coaster as you find yourself loving, feeling sorry for, and hating Ricci and Jackson at times.  If you're tired of the same old same old that Hollywood has been cranking out in record numbers, give this movie a try, it will impress.",5,Breath of Fresh Air,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,2484,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'movie', 'local', 'theatre', 'was', 'intrigued', 'marketing', 'department', 'had', 'done', 'job', 'established', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'character', 'had', 'sexual', 'addiction', 'rough', 'night', 'up', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'house', 'What', 'gripped', 'viewers', 'was', 'twist', 'chained', 'radiator', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go.I', 'started', 'wondering', 'what', 'hell', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'about', 'How', 'were', 'going', 'develop', 'entire', 'script', 'wondered', 'same', 'thing', 'Saw', 'saw', 'way', 'needed', 'see', 'film.Sadly', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'movie', 'theatres', 'was', 'loosely', 'looking', 'trailer', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'release', 'date', 'knew', 'here', 'DVD', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'love', 'Unfortunately', 'judging', 'progress', 'film', 'so', 'far', 'will', 'die', 'sleeper', 'film', 'death', 'eventually', 'only', 'be', 'known', 'entry', 'Mr', 'Skin', 'web', 'site', 'Ricci', 'topless', 'multiple', 'times', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'well-laid', 'plan', ""'re"", 'never', 'left', 'dark', 'too', 'long', 'also', 'are', ""n't"", 'fed', 'plot', 'relatively', 'unpredictable', 'Jackson', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'aged', 'African-American', 'living', 'poor', 'Southern', 'town', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'dynamic', 'similar', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'great', 'performance', 'Time', 'Kill', 'Ricci', 'solid', 'performance', 'recent', 'films', 'Prozac', 'Nation', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'even', 'Monster', 'have', 'been', 'building', 'talent', 'obviously', 'lost', 'lot', 'weight', 'role', 'subsequent', 'large', 'sunken', 'eyes', 'compliment', 'character', 'wonderfully', 'was', 'difficult', 'times', 'imagining', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'refused', 'be', 'naked', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'when', 'faced', 'lustful', 'transformed', 'role', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'also', 'small', 'role', 'Ricci', 'boyfriend', 'tender', 'endearing', 'performance', 'must', 'say', 'Timberlake', 'impressed', 'most', 'even', 'was', 'weakest', 'performance', 'three.This', 'movie', 'combines', 'trauma', 'sex', 'idiosyncracies', 'racism', 'wonderful', 'tunes', 'blues', 'rough', 'ride', 'one', 'girl', 'struggle', 'emotions', 'will', 'be', 'roller', 'coaster', 'find', 'loving', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'hating', 'Ricci', 'Jackson', 'times', ""'re"", 'tired', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'cranking', 'out', 'record', 'numbers', 'give', 'movie', 'try', 'will', 'impress']",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]

The image most people had that I spoke to at the time of it's release was that this was a film about a black man who chains a white girl to his radiator.  Lurid bondage images ensue.  I can imagine this tag would repel black audiences as well as white.  Though I've been a fan of both Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci for years my wife refused to see the movie with me when it was in theatres.  Paramount doesn't help it's cause by reinforcing this image in it's cover art.  This will probably turn out to be one of the best films of the year.  Let's put things in context.  Lazarus (Jackson) is experiencing a personal crisis because his wife recently left him for his brother.  Rae (Ricci) is a young woman with deep psychological wounds whose G.I. boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is shipping off.  Lazarus salves his sadness with booze.  Rae also engages in self destructive behavior not the least wanton promiscuity.  After a night of loose behavior with a bunch of rowdies Rae is picked up by Ronnie's best friend and subsequently beaten and left for dead on Lazarus' farm.  Upon finding a semi-conscious Rae, Lazarus attempts to nurse her back to health.  Lazarus, a god fearing man, subsequently finds out about Rae's reputation and in a drunken fever chains Rae to his radiator.  It is Lazarus' feeble attempt to reform Rae.  Not to give anything away Lazarus' eventually has an epiphany and realizes you cannot enforce morality but you can set an example.  It is then that the true bond between Lazarus and Rae grows.  There is a real love between the two and they have a redemptive influence on each other.  In other words they heal each other's wounds.  The film also emphasizes the healing influence of the polar opposites, religion and music, mainly the blues.  You won't find a more beautiful scene than the one where Rae sings ""Let it Shine"" at the knee of Lazarus as he strums his guitar.  ""Black Snake Moan"" is one of the more daring and provocative films in years.  Though it's rough going at times there is a morality at it's center.  Credit director Craig Brewer for tackling challenging material and making it work.  Jackson, who I always admired for taking ambitious roles, may have given the performance of his career.  This isn't hyperbole.  You have to see it to believe it.  Ricci is just as good here.  Timberlake also gives a sympathetic turn here as the anxiety-ridden Ronnie.

Still, the director's love of music and his honest effort to find love between the races as well as between the sexes seems to motivate him and the actors, who are as genuine as grits.

646436,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B00005JP97,Douglas King,"[1, 1]","Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci are two of my favorite screen actors. They're both quirky iconoclasts who occasionally make studio films, but always seem to really shine in offbeat, smaller pictures. The relationship between their two characters, Lazarus and Rae, is the heart and focus of this film. Both characters have been wounded by sex in ways that strangely complement one another: Lazarus has been betrayed by his cold, promiscuous wife, and Rae's history of sexual abuse has brought about her character's uncontrollable sexual compulsion.Lazarus and Rae meet when Rae is beaten and left unconscious by the side of the road after humiliating one of the many suitors who take advantage of her compulsive promiscuity.

646441,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JP97,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 5]","It would be too easy to dismiss this strangely unsatisfying 2007 film entirely because I can't tell whether director/writer Craig Brewer (Hustle & Flow) is trying to satirize the Southern gothic sensibilities of a Tennessee Williams potboiler or replicate the excesses of an early 1970's blaxploitation movie. Either way, he cannot seem to pull off his audacious premise which involves a cuckolded blues guitarist who enchains a nymphomaniac to his radiator. If the film was played out as over-the-top as the premise, then it might have had a fighting chance, but as it stands, Brewer is too ensconced in his chicken-fried fable to mine the potential black comedy in this hilariously preposterous exercise.The hackneyed plot centers on the appropriately named Lazarus, a self-righteous man stinging from his wife's decision to leave him for his younger brother. Meanwhile, a skeletal nymphomaniac, Rae, is so distraught over her boyfriend Ronnie leaving for the army that she goes on a hedonistic meltdown involving alcohol, prescription drugs and indiscriminate sex. A violent episode leaves her unconscious on the road where Lazarus finds her limp body. The rest of the film focuses on how the principals change from the ordeal but not before facing a lot of inner demons along the way. However, unlikeHustle & Flow, I cannot really say that I cared about the fate of these misbegotten characters at the end. Brewer just can't seem to connect the absurdity of the central situation with anything resembling real life, which ironically may be exactly his point here.The actors try hard to breathe empathetic life into the overripe characters, but they are ultimately defeated by the lurid dimensions of the story. As Lazarus, Samuel L. Jackson almost makes the situation palatable and even sings several blues numbers with surprising conviction, but Christina Ricci makes Rae a primal stockpile of white trash clich&eacute;s on top of a condescending back story. Justin Timberlake is completely out of his league as Ronnie and neutralizes every scene he's in with his amateur standing as an actor. Look for former child star Kim Richards (Escape to Witch Mountain) as Rae's defeated mother and a doozy of a fight scene between the two in a grocery store. The 2007 DVD has plenty of extras including an enthusiastic commentary track by Brewer and a half-hour making-of documentary, ""Conflicted: The Making of Black Snake Moan"".

While he's gone, she gets into trouble and ends up beaten on the side of the road near Lazarus' (Sam Jackson) farm. He takes her in and tries to cure her of her ills.There is a lot of great stuff here. Some really good dialogue with a fine ear for the Southern way of talking. It's also a very good idea for a story. All three of the main characters have demons they need to exorcise, and all end up helping each other. Much attention is paid to the God fearing mentality of the Southern Baptists, but they aren't demeaned. They are believers in the truest sense and respect is given them. This sense of religion underlines much of what happens here. On the bad side, there are some clunky scenes throughout, and they drag down the good stuff. And, though I'm no prude, there was some unnecessarily foul language here, particularly in one song Jackson was performing. The end was also a bit ""too."" but by that time the movie was over so there you have it. Jackson is great. Ricci is about as good as I've seen her and all others do a stand up job.

Okay, so this movie had all the signs of something quite...uh...un-churchlike. Here's the funny thing: Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci take part in a fantastic redemption tale.""Black Snake Moan"" starts its story with two hurting people who deal with their pain in very different ways. Rae, played by Ricci, is left alone when her boyfriend heads off to war, and finds herself giving way to her fleshly desires. There's not much hidden here, the rating is well-deserved, and yet there's little that's gratuitous. This is a woman looking for unconditional love in all the wrong places. Lazarus, played by Jackson, also wants the real deal of love, but he's been burned by his cheating wife and brother. He's withdrawn from everything.Two people. Two lives, caught in the black snake's coils. And somehow, through a set of circumstances that are at once over-the-top and wholly believable, Rae and Laz forge a chaste relationship that leads them both through the storm of evil to the light on the other side. Both see glimpses of hope, but neither is guaranteed of grasping it. They must act in faith and move forward.While jerking the chains of all who want to criticize, ""Black Snake Moan"" actually hides a beautiful tale of love and forgiveness. Even while performing his own tough love and intervention with Rae, Laz admits to his own weakness and deals with it. Both do a wonderful job of acting, with the music and the direction providing superb counterpoint to their emotional and spiritual journey. Timberlake is okay in his role, and the other supporting players do credible jobs.This here is not only a well-told story, it's also much closer to the Jesus I know from the Bible than the one we often see camouflaged in overly pious renditions.

It certainly is honest and very graphic about ""real life"" and all the crappy details of it. However, no more so than ""Platoon"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" although those films tend to glorify human suffering so much that it's difficult to take them seriously. Not so with this movie. It takes a surprisingly honest glimpse at the lives of women suffering from long term sexual abuse and dysfunctional family life. What I do find odd is how many men find the scenes of Ricci being statutorily raped ""hot"". I mean, she seems to be so much in a trance of pure pain all throughout these ""encounters"" that they couldn't really be considered consensual by anyone other than someone who is either seriously disturbed or someone who is an acquaintance rapist themselves.As difficult to watch sometimes as real life too often is, I really do wish that more films would do this honest of a job of representing the minds and lives of those trying to maintain their sanity and sense of humanity in a world that's only purpose at times, seems to be to torture us. Samuel Jackson is definitely at his best in this one as the ""good samaritan"" ( in this case, both literally and figuratively) and for someone who had to learn on the go, he sure can play that thing.I've heard it said that American audiences these days are falling behind in their ability to stomach films that give an uncomfortable portrayal of modern reality. Certainly, the numbers at the box office can attest to this with films like ""Bridesmaids"" and the latest comic-book adaption being seriously considered for awards.

646452,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B00005JP97,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","BLACK SNAKE MOANI remember when this film first came out all I heard about was some big controversy about a black man chaining up a naked white woman. My first thought was who cares I have seen more offensive things on cartoons, I mean come on. So the time went by and I never had the desire to watch this movie, at first. Eventually my brother brought this by and said he had been wanting to see it forever, not because of the stuff sounding the film but because of the great Sam Jackson. I agreed and said if he was in it then it probably would be good, plus I liked the writer/director's last film before this one. So I gave in and sat down to watch the movie and while I never felt offended ever threw out this I was surprised because I had no idea Justin Timberlake was in this.Rae [Ricci] is a disturbed girl who seems to not be able to overcome a past traumatic event involving sexual abuse and rape. In fact it is so bad that when she goes into her attacks she resorts to the only thing she learned as a little girl, sex with men. So after her man leaves for the military named Ronnie [Timberlake] she immediately goes into these attacks caused by his absence. She goes on to have sex with any and every man that she can when that feeling hits. That all starts to change one night after she is beaten and left for dead by Ronnie's brother later to be found on the road by Lazarus [Jackson].Lazarus has some problems of his own seeing that his wife has left him for his brother and his blues career is long gone. He is having enough trouble with out Rae when he stumbles upon her, he takes her in and starts to care for her. While in his care she comes in and out of conciseness every time in the middle of one of her episodes. Each time she throws are self at him and continues to do so when she comes out of it, I guess to thank him. It is at this point he sees what is going on and decides to cure her of her sickness, hence the now famous her tied up with a chain scenes. The movie plays out in what really was not all that controversial and actually kinda makes sense in a weird way. Ronnie is coming home and he has problems himself as we learn and Lazarus has a few friends that become involved.After watching this movie I did not see what the big deal was and can only believe it is because of the way the film was marketed. If the roles were reversed and an old white man had a young sex craved black woman tied up I still don't see any problem as long as the story was the same, but I am sure that would have been just as controversial. I think writer/director Craig Brewer did a good job with this film and took a whole different way than what I was lead to believe this film was. The film was actually a good piece of entertainment which is what films are all about, mostly. The film did have problems like most but over all I enjoyed it, a cool film about very different people helping each other find themselves. Also the shots in this film are excellent with the opening credits as a great example as is the blues music choosen for this, great stuff.As for performances Samuel L. Jackson as always was good and played the ex blues singer Lazarus well, he seems real dark at times but over the course of his time spent with Rae he becomes who he once was. Christina Ricci just may be the MVP of this production with a wonderfully sick performance. Sick as in the characters problems not a twisted horror movie kinda way, and she even gets topless and has some sex scenes. She goes from a sex crazed victim [love the scene with her mother] to a young woman learning how to deal with her problems. Still I was very surprised at the time I saw this with the performance of singer/actor Justin Timberlake. I have seen him in other things since [each time he has been great] but this was really the first time I can remember seeing him in a role like this. Timberlake impressed me with his performance here and the way he played the character when he returned home only to learn of his wife's affairs is great, turns out he has anxiety problems so he is messed up to. The last scene with Ricci and Timberlake is probably my favorite and he really shines in that scene. John Cothran as well is excellent in this as the preacher friend of Lazarus, Michael Raymond-James is great in this as well.This is not the best movie ever and some may say it is not the best follow up to his Academy award winning ""Hustle & Flow"" but I liked it. Sure this film could have used some work but I think most fault lies within the studios marketing of the film. Even the people involved with this film Ricci in particular did not like how it was marketed. If handled correctly and shown for what kind of film it truly is the film would have probably faired better.

There is some great tunes in this film with ol Samuel belting out some of his own along the way which i must admit is pretty darn good. Justin Timberlake again impresses as the anxiety ridden and troubled boyfriend of Ricci's character whose actions will have consequences for everybody. As silly as it sounds this film is well written and terrifically performed and has a very moral and decent undercurrent flowing throughout and has a lot to say about the healing power of love and care and redemption. Recommended for those who are after something a bit different and not just an excuse to watch Christina Ricci wonder around half naked for most of the film.,4,Simmering Deep South Style,1188864000,"09 4, 2007",2007,1053,"['Once', 'get', 'initial', 'seemingly', 'ridiculous', 'plotline', 'film', 'lot', 'enjoyment', 'be', 'had', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'incredibly', 'brave', 'role', 'nymphomaniac', 'who', 'left', 'dead', 'side', 'road', 'one', 'two', 'many', 'sexual', 'trists', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'damaged', 'moral', 'rescuer', 'who', 'radiator', 'house', 'attempts', 'cure', 'wicked', 'ways', 'great', 'tunes', 'film', 'ol', 'Samuel', 'belting', 'out', 'own', 'way', 'i', 'must', 'admit', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'again', 'anxiety', 'ridden', 'troubled', 'boyfriend', 'Ricci', 'character', 'actions', 'will', 'have', 'consequences', 'everybody', 'As', 'silly', 'film', 'well', 'written', 'terrifically', 'performed', 'very', 'moral', 'decent', 'undercurrent', 'flowing', 'lot', 'say', 'healing', 'power', 'love', 'care', 'redemption', 'Recommended', 'who', 'are', 'something', 'bit', 'different', 'not', 'just', 'excuse', 'watch', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'wonder', 'half', 'naked', 'most', 'film']",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]

646466,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00005JP97,Jason,"[0, 0]","A politically incorrect melting pot of rural American culture, BSM manages to tackle social, sexual, racial, and political issues without an overly exploitative nature.  With an intriguing storyline, an impeccable atmosphere, and great character development, not to mention the incredible performances from both Samuel L. Jackson as a believable southern bluesman named Lazarus and Christina Ricci as a promiscuous Rae, the production and acting are enough to make this a must-see.Essentially, the movie is just as the previews showed it: a black, southern bluesman finds a scantily clad, waiflike, white slut beaten on the side of the road, and he chains her to a radiator.  What's surprising, however, is that the chaining is more symbolic, more metaphorical than actually being provocative or sexual.  In fact, it's probably asexual if anything; Lazarus does it to help the healing process, and, by the way, to keep Rae's ""itch"" from causing her to screw everyone in sight like an overzealous car dealer.Facing the despair of a difficult, small-town, rural life, one in which each has to deal with past demons - Rae's combination of nymphomania, abandonment, and child abuse, Lazarus' betrayal at the hands of his wife and brother - the two undertake a healing experience together in which their souls are resurrected from an unfortunate demise.The biggest problem I have with BSM is that it's supposed to be a tale of morality, but it's replete with hypocrisy, thereby tarnishing the message.  So the female's carnal urges need to be controlled, but the male sexual urge can be the topic of a crowd-inspiring blues song?  Aside from that, the clear racial and sexual messages are askew to say the least.  The movie is set in a contemporary setting, but the overtones reek of northern superiority, presenting the premise that if Lazarus had called the police, there is nearly no doubt that he would have been charged, if not convicted - better to just chain the whore to the furnace!  Last but not least, for a movie that presumes to teach moral, racial, and sexual lessons, the imagery of enslavement is inappropriate no matter which racial setup is used.  Imagine the outcry if Jackson were replaced with Bruce Willis and Ricci were replaced with Gabrielle Union!Along with a great blues soundtrack, the emotional plot of BSM makes for a pretty good movie.  Ultimately, there is a hopeful, positive resolution for both main characters, and the drama is compelling enough to border on greatness.

If this film were made in the late sixties, it would be an unabashed cult classic that we'd be boasting of for decades. Samuel L. Jackson delivers another solid performance complete w/ gritty guitar-playing. Christina Ricci delivers a well-acted performance, although she can be a bit annoying at times. I'm gaining  even more respect for Justin Timberlake since the SNL skit and after seeing his performance in this movie, things have never looked better for him. Some of the scenes w/o Sammy can drag, but the movie's themes balance it out and make for an enjoyable time for all. I don't know how Sammy stumbled on the snake theme, but it's definitely working for him. Also, David Banner is in this movie .. his first starting role pretty much suites him. He'd done his character naturally to the point he didn't have to act. I'm curious to see how far this rapper might go. The lighting, cinematography, music, film editing, and direction are absolutely stellar. The character development is so deep that you feel you actually understand them in their messed-up, crazy actions, and because of it nothing seems too far-fetched or out of the ordinary, even when it is. The movie presents itself to be about sex, but it is about far more than that. It is about loss, redemption, determination, and overcoming the mere physical pleasures in life to understand the deeper meaning of love.It is a film about music. While watching this, I found myself lost in the poetry of the old blues lyrics. By understanding the art of blues, the audience is able to more fully comprehend what this film is about. Much like 'Hustle and Flow' tried to explain what Hip-Hop meant to it's hard-core ""real"" fans, 'Black Snake Moan' shows how the free-style, yet structured world of blues can act as the guiding light to those lost in the realm of physical pleasure. Blues is playing what you feel, but never straying from the main form that got you there. In the movie, the camera might stray from the norm of what we're used to seeing, but it never completely loses us. The editing, lighting, and direction is freestyle, but not in an Oliver Stone 'freakishly annoying' kind of way.The blues is what leads to the final understanding between the two main characters. Music offers the understanding, redemption, and calmness through loss. This one is definitely not for everyone, as you might guess from the drugs, cursing, boozing, wild sex, assault, kidnapping, bondage, nearly naked people, frequent underwear moments, blues club dance moves and an overabundance of fringe religious bellowing. If you are a bit twisted, you will definitely see the humorous and campy moments and please don't take any of it too seriously. It is just a step up from Mr. Jackson's sub par ""Snakes on a Plane"" ... but the music is much better (except for the singing).",4,"""I'm cookin' steaks fah dinnah.

Given the way it was presented in the preview, I was expecting a cross between the comedic 'Snakes on a Plane' and some kind of titillating s&m; thing; I mean Christina in bondage with tight shirt and panties?  Yowza.  Needless to say, my wife was not at all looking forward to seeing this one.This movie is nothing like that.  First off, Christina is anything but appealing in this movie.  She is greasy, beat-up, unwashed, and pathologically promiscuous.  You can almost see the stank lines radiating off her.  Second, there is nothing sexy about the movie.  The sex scene are just plain disturbing and very uncomfortable.  As far as comedy goes, there is very little.What the movie is though, is an emotionally engaging, interesting story acted supremely by everyone involved, with the exception of Justin Timberlake.  I mean for a singer, he does a good job; but he is acting with some of the elite talent in the world here so he is very much out of place.

We found the story to be believable and engaging with the ring of truth about it.  Which is not surprising, for the director had taken elements from his own life and put them into the characters.

Lazarus is trying to come to terms with his wife of 12 years leaving him for his younger brother. Rea is a woman who has suffered unmentionable sexual abuse since her childhood and therefore acts out the part for others to prey upon her. One night after a night of hard, careless partying she is beaten and left for dead on the road near Lazarus's house. Not knowing what to do but help her, Lazarus takes it upon himself to bring Rea back to health, only to discover that she has far deeper scars and problems than the physical ones left on her face. He is then determined to make her well, and through his faith,and belief  that ""God saw fit to have us cross paths"" he does so the only way he knows how. The two ultimately develop a friendship under unusual circumstances, and through music which Lazarus has sworn off for so long, the two heal one another while unknowingly shedding their demons. The cords struck by Sam Jackson playing ""Black Snake Moan"" will resonate through you and send chills down your spine, which also turns out to be the turning point between the two characters in the film. This was a fantastic film I thoroughly enjoyed with Sam Jackson and Christina Ricci. My only disappointment was that Justin Timberlake was cast in this film, but fortunately with his roughly 10 minutes of screen time I can tolerate it. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and if you are as big a blues fan as I am, both the soundtrack and DVD are well worth purchasing. Sam Jackson is one of those rare actors that his on screen presence demands your full attention.Truely a tallented actor, Jackson took it upon himself to learn how to play guitar for this very film.The music in this film tells as much about this story as the dialog does,almost as an additional character playing alongside everyone else.Ricci is another tallented actress with a bright future by taking roles that get her noticed while graduating out of the kiddie roles she is most remembered for.Black Snake Moan delivers superb acting both by Jackson and Ricci, a fantastic and originally written story with a soundtrack to carry it every step of the way.

It's a unique film that features two terrific performances by Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci, both delivering their best performances in years. It also features another star-making performance by Justin Timberlake (who recently impressed me in ""Alpha Dog""). The film stars Ricci as Rae, that girl that lives in every city in America and is usually referred to as ""the town slut."" After her boyfriend Ronnie (Timberlake) leaves her for a stint in the Army, she begins getting more and more destructive; eventually, she is almost raped, beaten, and tossed out in the road. Lazarus (Jackson) has recently been left by his wife for his brother and when he finds the young girl lying in the road he takes responsibility for curing the ""sickness"" she has.So, naturally, he chains her to his radiator. When she finally wakes up, she's shocked at first but eventually grows to love Lazarus...And soon, they realize that Lazarus is not just helping her but they're helping each other. This is a great film and, as a result, it's been hailed around the world as such...But it hasn't quite garnered commercial attention and this is sad. It may not sound like the kind of movie that will appeal to a massive audience, but it's a movie that I think people will find themselves enjoying. It's a fable about love, redemption, and sex...The story could've gone in many different directions, but writer/director Craig Brewer keeps it all together and takes what could've been a completely meaningless story and makes it almost life-affirming. Jackson is an actor who never fails to impress, but he's an actor who has made more bad movies than good ones. Here, I'm not going out on a limb by saying it could be his best performance (and maybe even his best film) since ""Pulp Fiction."" Ricci has always been an actress that's impressed me, but she hasn't done much worth noting over the past 5 years. That makes her comeback here all the more impressive. She combines all the right notes of vulnerability and sexual animosity to make this performance incredibly believable. As for Timberlake, he didn't impress me as much here as he did in ""Alpha Dog"" but he definitely leaves me asking where he got his acting chops? If he chokes a pretzel and ruins his vocal cords or something, acting could definitely be a fall back for him.

646479,A3PG0F1KA7ZT3O,B00005JP97,KatieHepburn,"[2, 2]","The rhythm of the Blues is birthed down and dirty like Georgia clay or Mississippi mud. It is where the musician's feet seek out the surface to beat against which matches the cadence of the emotional flow that first quickens the heart to react discordantly to the pain of love gone wrong. As Son House, legendary blues singer and guitarist, tells us: ""I'm talkin' about the Blues... When two people, supposed to be in love, when one or the other deceives the other through their love..."" It starts with a wail, a scream, a guttural cry from the throat of a seasoned songster or, maybe a saxophone will tell that part, and next the story behind it all is laid out in spades. Then, we cry. The Blues. There is nothing better on earth by which to heal a broken heart, whether that broken heart be from a failed marriage, loss of a loved one, a broken friendship for no good reason under the sun... All loss is like death, and listening to the blues is like having someone, even a stranger we just met at P.K.'s Place, who understands our innermost feelings sit right alongside us to grieve them to the ground.What 'Black Snake Moan', the movie, does is move us deeper to explore the underbelly of pain. It exposes the sheer ugliness of it, a portion of the malevolence of that which causes it and then it tears off the veil of the lie that says it can go away if you just want it bad enough. Moreover, it does not devalue the persons who experience pain and its effects. Is their (Rae and Ronny's) plight hopeless? Who knows? There has to be hope or let us just grant every nation permission to push the big red button that will allow us our collective journey to stand before our Maker. The fact that Laz reached out to help while mired deep in the newness of his own blues tune added a redemptive note. How beautiful with that gospel tone insinuated into his own despondent melodia. And, finally, the key to that redemption in the tone of black - sharp, but steady on. He found this ivory skinned doll, laid flat and damaged and then chose to take her in and let the melody of his father soul fuse with that of the child and ... well, you'll just have to see.Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci are two very fine actors and this movie is great for their contribution. S. Epatha Merkerson is an excellent addition to anything she is involved in, and this is no exception. While Justin Timerberlake may not possess finely honed acting skills at the point of this movie, what I saw in 'Social Network' certainly shows steady, quality growth. For crying out loud! He started out in a boy band, and now he's in an Academy Award winning movie. He's no slouch.Another aspect that makes this movie work is the combination of gritty country scenery and great Blues music. The fact that Samuel Jackson can hold his own on a song is certainly a benefit. Overall the whole piece is something this director can be proud of and I can't wait to see what else he comes up with. Craig Brewer would be an interesting man to have a conversation with considering his mind and heart wrote of the spiritual aspects built into the hard living, tough talking lives of these characters who still looked to their God.

646480,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00005JP97,K. Driscoll,"[28, 30]","Craig Brewer (Hustle and Flow) directs his second mainstream film and John Singleton produces.  Black Snake Moan stars Samuel L. Jackson as Lazarus, a religious man living in a small southern town.  Lazarus is also a blues musician. His demons are that his wife left him for his own brother and for this he is riddled with anger.  Christina Ricci plays Rae, who is an overly promiscuous girl who is traumatized by a history of child sexual abuse.  On top of that her boyfriend Ronnie has left to join the National Guard.  Ronnie is played by Justin Timberlake.  After Ronnie leaves, Rae ends up having a pretty bad evening that leaves her scantily clad and beat up in the middle of a dirt road.  She is left on a road just in front of Lazarus's house.  After helping her get better, he soon comes to find out who Rae is and what kind of reputation she has.  Lazarus sees this as a sign from god that he must heal her of her wickedness in order to receive some redemption for himself.  So he ties her up to a giant 40 pound chain.The film has a great atmosphere.  It comes off as sticky and sweaty throughout and plays with that imagery as the characters develop.  It consistently offers references to blues music and the characters are loud and full of life.  It comes off as exploitative in some ways but that is ultimately done for a greater cause. Samuel L. Jackson is always good, even in really bad movies, but this is one of his best roles in many years.  The real star here though is Christina Ricci who I've always felt is doing whatever she wants for now but one day she will be hailed as one of the best actresses around after a performance that hits the mainstream just right. Unfortunately for her though Black Snake Moan has not yet been a commercial success.  None of that really matters though because it is still a very good movie although both Jackson and Ricci are even better than the screenplay and direction demand.Some people say the film is hypocritical for sexualizing Rae and offering several erotic scenes with her, while at the same time presenting a negative view of sexuality.  Firstly, I disagree that the film portrays sexuality as a negative but instead portrays excess as a negative.  I did not feel hammered down by any messages that sex is wrong.  Secondly, Black Snake Moan is definitely not meant to be erotic.  It certainly rings of exploitation films but by watching Rae's transformation away from nymphomania and toward stabilization, away from her history of abuse to some degree of resolution, away from vulnerable to honest and confident, and away from being naked to being clothed; I can't help but think this is a fiercely unsexy film that is against hypersexuality alone.  To be pro-spirituality and critical of actions often perceived as sinful is not puritanical and not even necessarily anti-sex.

646484,AGKPTMTR3UX1R,B00005JP97,"Konrei ""Everything I need is right here""","[1, 1]","An excellent, underrated movie betrayed by its atrocious theatrical poster, BLACK SNAKE MOAN works on just so many levels. Samuel L. Jackson is Lazarus, a farmer and natural blues guitarist living in rural Tennessee. Lazarus' wife has left him for his brother, and the bitter Lazarus veers like a skirling wind between self-pity, world-weariness, emotionally-charged violence, and religiously-fueled hopefulness.One morning, he finds Rae (Christina Ricci) lying beaten, bloody, and naked in the road near his house. Rae is the girl in town with the ""reputation""; the least perjorative way to describe her behavior is that she uses her sexuality as both a weapon and a shield, closing herself off from a trauma-scarred childhood. Consequently, Rae manipulates men and is victimized by them. Her boyfriend Ronnie has just been deployed with the Tennessee National Guard, and in her lonely misery, her evening companion has attacked her and dumped her off.The lonely Lazarus takes Rae in, but realizing that she is delirious both from the beating and a raging fever, he chains her inside the house so she will not wander. Although Rae first tries to get away, she soon finds in Lazarus a kindred spirit, and the two become friends.Unfortunately, the image of Lazarus holding the panty-clad Rae by a length of chain is the image the promoters chose to market this film. This sexually-charged, racially stereotyped symbolism undoubtedly ruined this film's reception. And it's a shame, because BLACK SNAKE MOAN is a splendid film with great depth. Of course, the mostly-naked Ricci is sexy in a trailer park way (it's said that she put herself on a diet of junk to acheive the sallow, sunken-eyed look which typifies Rae), but the relationship between Lazarus and Rae develops into a profoundly moving father-daughter bond as the film progresses.It is not one-sided. Both Rae and Lazarus are able to collect the shards of their shattered self-esteem and rebuild their lives. In the Hollywood manner, all their complex problems are resolved by the end of the third reel, but nonetheless, BLACK SNAKE MOAN gives us a wonderful portrait of two deeply wounded people finding themselves in each other's eyes.There are many women like Rae; and there are many men like Lazarus. It is the reality of their shared experience that hits home with such force. We know these people. On some level, we are these people. A film can accomplish nothing finer nor more meaningful and lasting than that. The blues soundtrack is a perfect underscore to what we see onscreen.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",5,"""This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine . . .""",1220486400,"09 4, 2008",2008,2571,"['excellent', 'underrated', 'movie', 'betrayed', 'atrocious', 'theatrical', 'poster', 'BLACK', 'SNAKE', 'MOAN', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Lazarus', 'farmer', 'natural', 'blues', 'guitarist', 'living', 'rural', 'Tennessee', 'Lazarus', 'wife', 'left', 'brother', 'bitter', 'Lazarus', 'veers', 'skirling', 'wind', 'self-pity', 'world-weariness', 'emotionally-charged', 'violence', 'religiously-fueled', 'hopefulness.One', 'morning', 'Rae', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'lying', 'beaten', 'bloody', 'naked', 'road', 'house', 'Rae', 'girl', 'town', 'reputation', 'least', 'perjorative', 'way', 'describe', 'behavior', 'sexuality', 'weapon', 'shield', 'closing', 'off', 'trauma-scarred', 'childhood', 'Consequently', 'Rae', 'men', 'victimized', 'boyfriend', 'Ronnie', 'just', 'been', 'deployed', 'Tennessee', 'National', 'Guard', 'lonely', 'misery', 'evening', 'companion', 'attacked', 'dumped', 'off.The', 'lonely', 'Lazarus', 'Rae', 'realizing', 'delirious', 'beating', 'raging', 'fever', 'house', 'will', 'not', 'wander', 'Rae', 'first', 'tries', 'get', 'away', 'soon', 'Lazarus', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'two', 'become', 'friends.Unfortunately', 'image', 'Lazarus', 'holding', 'panty-clad', 'Rae', 'length', 'chain', 'image', 'promoters', 'chose', 'market', 'film', 'sexually-charged', 'racially', 'stereotyped', 'symbolism', 'undoubtedly', 'ruined', 'film', 'reception', 'shame', 'BLACK', 'SNAKE', 'MOAN', 'splendid', 'film', 'great', 'depth', 'course', 'mostly-naked', 'Ricci', 'sexy', 'trailer', 'park', 'way', 'said', 'put', 'diet', 'junk', 'acheive', 'sallow', 'sunken-eyed', 'look', 'Rae', 'relationship', 'Lazarus', 'Rae', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'father-daughter', 'bond', 'film', 'progresses.It', 'not', 'one-sided', 'Rae', 'Lazarus', 'are', 'able', 'collect', 'shards', 'shattered', 'self-esteem', 'rebuild', 'lives', 'Hollywood', 'manner', 'complex', 'problems', 'are', 'resolved', 'end', 'third', 'reel', 'nonetheless', 'BLACK', 'SNAKE', 'MOAN', 'wonderful', 'portrait', 'two', 'deeply', 'wounded', 'people', 'finding', 'other', 'are', 'many', 'women', 'Rae', 'are', 'many', 'men', 'Lazarus', 'reality', 'shared', 'experience', 'home', 'such', 'force', 'know', 'people', 'level', 'are', 'people', 'film', 'can', 'accomplish', 'nothing', 'finer', 'more', 'meaningful', 'lasting', 'blues', 'soundtrack', 'perfect', 'underscore', 'what', 'see', 'onscreen.VERY', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]

Everyone was saying it was cheap, and that 3/4 of the movie was Ricci naked. However, it was nothing like that...So story is about this young woman (Rae) who lives with her boyfriend (Timberlake) and is torn apart when he leaves for military training. After he leaves, Rae becomes very promiscuous, getting involved with every man she sees. One night she is beaten by her boyfriend's friend and she is rescued by a man named Lazarus (Jackson). He also has just been left by his wife, who cheated on him. They are suffering from the same loss and Lazarus ties Rae up and refuses to let her go. Along the way, hes helping her overcome her ""sickness"" of sleeping with everyone she sees.Good acting by Jackson, Ricci is pretty good. Timberlake still needs a lot of work but he manages to perform a mediocre role. If you read into the plot its pretty interesting. Two people suffering from the same loss. Each of their stories are told before they become reunited in an awkward way. Its great. Good plot, good directing, and good acting.The only thing i didnt like was the unrealistic fact that Ricci's white underwear kept being white after 3 days and rolling around in the mud...yeah ok i dont think so. Also, the movie started dragging too much at the end. It should have ended at an earlier point to make the story more interesting (as when they are singing together).An overall good movie.

Secondly, with a do respect, I don't share the same conclusion, nor do I see what the other viewers saw, but what I saw was an absolute mess. This movie is not good. Don't get me wrong, I like Christina Ricci. I think most of her movies push the envelope, and she made me fan for life with her role in ""Monster"". The same goes for Sam Jackson. Sam is just Sam, what else can I say, but he always brings it. However, neither one of them could save this movie. Even Justin Timberlake's performance was much better than expected, but he couldn't save this either. I think this is a film where the writing just sucks with a capital S. Forgive me, but I wasn't impressed in the least by seeing a movie about a woman in the South sleeping with any and everything with a heartbeat. Is the the best they could do? For real, this movie isn't realistic at all. Not to mention, this movie gets so boring so fast that it'll make your head spin. By the end, I didn't care what happened I just wanted it to be over. Believe me, I really tried to give it a fair chance and make myself finish this movie, but I just didn't like it at all. Christina Ricci plays Rae, a woman with an extreme sexual addiction. It's not surprising at all that this behavior is a result of molestation. Anyway, Rae sleeps around with everyone in town, and everybody knows it. Sam Jackson plays Lazarus, a man who's wife has left him for his younger brother. One night, after Rae has had another one of her sexual encounters and is left in the middle of nowhere practically naked, her boyfriend's friend picks her up. After she comes on to him, he beats her down, and thinking that's he's killed her, he pushes her out of the front seat of his car and leaves her for dead. Lazarus finds her and nurses her back to health so to speak. It's during this time that he's realized that his purpose in life is to help this lost soul. Rae wakes up bound by huge chains around her waiste, so she can't leave and give in to her sexual desires any longer. This is Laz's way of ridding her of the inner demons that make her do these things. Anyway, that's about it, end of story. What was good about that?

646488,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JP97,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","When you see the trailer or the poster of ""Black Snake Moan"" you have to think that this film belongs on a double-feature with ""Grindhouse"" (okay, that would make it a triple feature).  After all, you have a black man holding a scantily clad young white woman in chains.  This is a movie that screams ""EXPLOITATION!""  But the black man in question is Samuel L. Jackson, the white woman is Christina Ricci, and ""Black Snake Moan"" is written and directed by Craig Brewer, whose previous effort ""Hustle & Flow"" is remembered more for its Oscar winning song ""It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp"" rather than Terrence Howard's Oscar nominated performance by those who have not seen the movie (I would have voted for Howard over Philip Seymour Hoffman).  So you have to suspect with these people involved that ""Black Snake Moan"" is not just going to be something like ""Diary of a Nymph"" with a way bigger budget (actually the movie I was most reminded of when watching this one was ""Secretary"" because it was another movie after people with serious problems that ended up touching me).Jackson plays Lazarus, a broken-down blues musician whose wife has finally left him.  Lazarus makes his living as a vegetable market gardener living back in the woods all by his lonesome.  Ricci is Rae, whose boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) makes love to her one more time before he goes off to join the military.  The problem is that as soon as Ronnie leaves the tearful Rae behind, she starts getting the need for lovin' something fierce.  Rae literally has an itch to scratch and she turns to the wrong guy, which is why Laz finds her battered body on the road near his place.  He takes care of her and discovers her story and not only decides that she needs to be cured of her nymphomania, but that the way to do this is to get a big ol' hunk of chain, put one end around her waist with a padlock and tie the other to the radiator in his house.  Laz feels the need to ""suffer"" Rae.  His mind is fixed and he will not be moved and we sure know damn well not to try and argue with the man.What happens next should be left for you to discover yourself and I think most viewers will be pleasantly surprised by the way this story plays out and impressed by the performances, which are arguably the best that Jackson and Ricci have done to date.  They certainly throw themselves into these roles, which for Jackson meant learning to play the guitar and sing the blues while Ricci got to pick out her chain.  I also like the character of the Reverend R.L., played by John Cothran, Jr., because the man talks sense, embodying Christian virtues without feeling the need to constantly quote Scripture.  I also liked that with both R.L. and the character of Angela (S. Epatha Merkerson), Laz is smart enough to know that what he is trying to do for Rae is not something he can do by himself.  Bonus points to Brewer for bringing back Kim Richards to play Rae's white trash moma, Sandy.

Yes, this is what makes this film worth your time. Aside from the fact that Christina Ricci graces you with her amazing body and seductive ways for 115 minutes, Black Snake Moan actually has an interesting story. The movie itself is strange, and had the right actors for the parts. That is all except for Justin Timberlake, who has no business on any Cinema screen. He is a music performer, he should keep it that way. His parts almost de-rail the film as he doesn't look as if he belongs in the movie at all. With that said and out the way the rest of the movie is great. It's not A+ amazing, but Christina Ricci's character makes it all worth your while. Samuel L. Jackson plays another one of his oddball character rolls. This time he is a halfway crazy man (that's pretty good for a Samuel L. role) who wants to shed some light in the world. I'm not really sure what compelled him to out of no where decide to start helping Rae change her life. It seemed as though he was pretty off the wall and down on his own luck himself, then all of a sudden he is a religious warrior spreading good and cleansing the wicked. I think that transition is the only part of the movie that could have used more explaining. It made the things Samuel L. did seem akward because very little of the story was shed on what compelled him to save Rae, other than he found her on the road. With that aside it's hard to say anything bad about a plot that is focused around on a half naked Christina Ricci. Matter of fact suprisingly how easily this movie could of just been written off as ranchy, it never really crosses that line. It's actually about a caring man trying to help a young woman. Samuel L's character can only do but so much for Rae before he leaves it all up to her. Ironically in a movie that's so far from reality, it does have a sense of realism to it. **possible spoiler**Rae is never fully cured, but she now has the understanding of how she can ease and control her desires. That is the gift that Samuel L. gave to her. Overall Black Snake Moan was an interesting movie well worth checking out. It's not bad, it's not unbelievably amazing, it's just all out plain ""good"". and that makes it a 5 star film under my watch.PS.

Being someone who really loves old time blues music it was like a video track to all great blues tunes! It reaches to the heart of the music and tells a great story at the same time.... The title itself was taken from a song by 1920's bluesman Blind Lemon Jefferson.Take a nymphomaniac who has paired off with a weak-willed man and then through fate introduce her to a world wise ex bluesman with an obsessive religious streak and every character's issues are out on the table. The acting performances in this movie are compellingly believable and well done. From the first fifteen minutes of this movie forward you are drawn into the lives of these people and you can't help wondering how things will turn out for them.Most profound of all though this movie is a powerful and gripping story about love & redemption. While liking blues music may give you more of an appreciation for it, this is hardly a requirement to enjoy this film.

She's one of the few child stars that has managed to make a name for herself in adult films unlike some unmentionables, and not be known as Wednesday Addams anymore.Black Snake Moan was a very strange film. Some of it didn't make sense, and Rae and Lazarus's relationship can be quite difficult to watch at times. For the guys, Christina appears topless (only her second topless scene since Prozac Nation), and wears very little. Tiny shorts, and a top cut in half was her wardrobe. Oh, and cowboy boots. The scene that sticks out was her walking along the road, and this giant truck behind her, hooting at her to get out the way, and she sticks her middle finger up.Black Snake Moan's reviews/trailers do not do it justice. I watched it expecting something entirely different to what I've read about it. Samuel L Jackson was amazing, and can actually sing and play the guitar (which he learned while filming Snakes On A Plane.) Personally, I don't like his singing voice. The whole blues/jazz stuff really isn't what I would listen to on a day-to-day basis. What I did love was of course the song that is NOT on the soundtrack, and I am now desperate to get my hands on this song. If it is her, Christina has a really nice voice, singing ""This Little Light Of Mine"", although the song got stuck in my head and I couldn't get to sleep.The story goes that Rae's boyfriend, Ronnie (played by the shockingly wooden Justin Timberlake) goes off to fight a war and leaves her behind. Sleep with her and leave her. While he goes, she goes off the rail, and sleeps with every man who comes near her. An addiction possibly? She also drinks and then one night takes something she shouldn't and gets beaten up by Ronnie's so called best friend. Lazarus finds her by the side of the road, and decides he needs to take care of her. Which includes chaining her skinny little self with a 40lb chain to the radiator. They shout, they scream, they gradually begin to understand and help the other.The film does get a little waylaid towards the end. I wasn't sure about the ending. I was kinda hoping Ronnie's character wouldn't come back but he did with a (wooden) vengence. The film could have been so much better without him. Still strange, but better.Christina plays the character of Rae brilliantly. After watching it I couldn't imagine any other actress who could have played this role. Yes, she was shockingly too skinny, but it was part of the character. (Although recent photos I've seen of her have made her look like a lollipop head.) The dirty blonde hair, the bags under the eyes, and the clothes just fit the character to a T.While I wouldn't recommend Black Snake Moan to everybody (I think you have to be in the right frame of mind to watch a young girl being chained by an older man, and not think there's something snapped in his brain to make him do that), it is one of those strange movies that you have to pick up if it's not too expensive. It is worthwhile seeing, although it won't leave a lasting impression afterwards.

646499,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JP97,mirasreviews,"[2, 2]","""Black Snake Moan"", Craig Brewer's second film to emerge from Southern musical traditions, takes its name from the song recorded in 1927 by Texas blues man Blind Lemon Jefferson. Where 2005's ""Hustle & Flow"" found inspiration in crunk, ""Black Snake Moan"" is all about the blues. The film approaches the themes of Sin and Redemption, the Devil and God, and Man and Woman much as a blues song would, with unrestrained melodrama, conviction, and humor, to create a provocative and oddly empathetic Southern fable.Rae (Christina Ricci) is a troubled young woman with an abusive past. She finds peace with boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), but when he leaves on a military tour, Rae turns back to booze and indiscriminate sex to cope with her fears. Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is a farmer and former musician overcome with bitterness and self-righteousness since his wife left him. After a night of partying, Rae is left beaten and unconscious on the road. Lazarus takes her in to nurse her back to health. But when he learns of Rae's self-destructive lifestyle, he makes it his mission to save her spiritually as well -even if he has to chain her to a radiator to do it.Rae and Lazarus' behavior is over the top, but so is the angst and violence in blues music. Craig Brewer's stories grow out of the music he loves, which make for an interesting fusion of art forms. Brewer undertakes the score and soundtrack with as much diligence, if not more, as he does the visuals. The piercing sound of cicadas gives an impression of place even before the film starts. ""Black Snake Moan"" reunites the creative team from ""Hustle & Flow"", including composer Scott Bomar. Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci, who is unforgettable as Rae, infuse this blues homage with soul.The DVD (Paramount 2007): There are 3 featurettes, 5 Deleted Scenes with optional commentary, a Photo Gallery of 33 images, and an audio commentary. ""Conflicted: The Making of Black Snake Moan"" (27 min) interviews director Craig Brewer, producers Stephanie Alain and John Singleton, the cast, and others about the film's conception, making, casting, themes, music, and the infamous chain. ""Rooted in the Blues"" (13 min) talks with Brewer and composer Scott Bomar about the music and musicians. ""The Black Snake Moan"" (9 min) is about the song, the editing, and the scene in which Samuel Jackson performs it. In the audio commentary, Craig Brewer discusses locations, actors, music, themes, audience reaction, and his decisions and experiences while filming. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.

Christina Ricci running around near-naked for the whole film? That's something I have to see...OK, enough of the dirty old man act.  EXCEPT, that's what the film is aiming at, isn't it?  The poster -- the ads -- the first scene -- this is going to be an exploitation film, and an over the top one at that:  nubile, waifish nymphomaniac Rae (Ricci) ends up bloodied and beaten, on farmer and ex-bluesman Lazarus' (Samuel L Jackson) doorstep, just at the moment when Jackson seems about ready to go 'round the bend.So Lazarus, after nursing the physically sick Rae back to health over a couple of days does what any rural farmer in the south would do with a woman half his age and of another race -- he chains her to a radiator in some odd misguided effort to cleanse her of ""evil spirits"" or some such nonsense; it's never spelled out very explicitly just what Lazarus believes, or doesn't believe, he can do.There's plenty of sleazy, trashy fun to be had here; our heroine does indeed run around in next to nothing for nearly the whole film, and Jackson's tortured musician Lazarus embodies a whole lot of fun southern black stereotypes -- and I do mean fun; this is certainly a film that tries to avoid racism at all costs.  If anything, it's saying that sure, blacks and white are a little different -- they're just messed up in different ways, and we'd best try to understand that, because we're all in it together.  They certainly are in director Craig Brewer's vision of the mid-south -- this small town has to be the best-integrated place in America.But never mind all that.  The film moves, the dialogue is mostly crisp, the acting (especially, and surprisingly, by Justin Timberlake as Ricci's rather confused boyfriend Ronnie) is solid.  The biggest problem that it has I think, is that it doesn't know whether to continue down the sordid route, or attempt a little morality play and make nice at the end.

Seeing a scantily clad Christina Ricci chained up in the house of Samuel L. Jackson is certainly eye opening enough, but beyond it's exploitation-esque gloss, Black Snake Moan is a surprisingly heartfelt and even touching excursion from Hustle & Flow writer/director Craig Brewer.  Jackson plays Lazarus, a down and out blues musician whose wife has just left him for his own brother, while Ricci plays Rae, a trailer-trash nympho whom Lazarus finds beaten up and left for dead after a wild night.  Realizing the girl has some serious problems, Lazarus chains her up in his house for her own good in an effort to save her soul, and in the process, save his own.  What makes Black Snake Moan so good are the performances from Jackson and Ricci, as two lost souls who receive a form of healing that neither would have expected.  Also worth noting is pop-star Justin Timberlake, who turns in a surprisingly good performance as Rae's Iraq veteran boyfriend who comes home in search of her, and gets quite a surprise indeed.  Despite its lurid presentation, Black Snake Moan is a surprisingly heartfelt story of blues and redemption that is more than worth seeing, and the fact that the film manages to stay with you after the credits roll is what's most surprising of all.",4,Love hurts,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,1361,"['first', 'seeing', 'previews', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'Seeing', 'scantily', 'clad', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'chained', 'up', 'house', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'certainly', 'eye', 'opening', 'enough', 'exploitation-esque', 'gloss', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'surprisingly', 'heartfelt', 'even', 'touching', 'excursion', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'writer/director', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'Jackson', 'Lazarus', 'down', 'blues', 'musician', 'wife', 'just', 'left', 'own', 'brother', 'Ricci', 'Rae', 'trailer-trash', 'nympho', 'whom', 'Lazarus', 'beaten', 'up', 'left', 'dead', 'wild', 'night', 'Realizing', 'girl', 'serious', 'problems', 'Lazarus', 'up', 'house', 'own', 'good', 'effort', 'save', 'soul', 'process', 'save', 'own', 'What', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'so', 'good', 'are', 'performances', 'Jackson', 'Ricci', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'who', 'receive', 'form', 'healing', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'Also', 'worth', 'noting', 'pop-star', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performance', 'Rae', 'Iraq', 'veteran', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'home', 'search', 'her', 'quite', 'surprise', 'indeed', 'lurid', 'presentation', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'surprisingly', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'blues', 'redemption', 'more', 'worth', 'seeing', 'fact', 'film', 'stay', 'credits', 'roll', 'what', 'most', 'surprising']",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]

Lazarus is middle aged, black man with unsteady employment and passion for blues (he plays guitar and sings in a local bar).  Ray on the other hand is pettite, blond, promiscuous young woman without a clear direction in her life.  As Ray gets badly beaten one day, she is found by Lazarus outside of his home who quickly discovers her insatiable taste for sex with any man that happens to be around. To teach her a lesson, Lazarus chains her to the radiator in attempt to force her self-realization and at the same time redeem himself from pain he feels after being abandoned by his wife of many years who leaves him for his younger brother.  In spite of constant thugging between these two and Ray's unsuccessful attempts to seduce Lazarus in order to ""free"" herself from his chains these two create a strong bond without ever kissing each other.  This is multi-layered, deeply emotional film that requires exploration who we are, why are we are the way we are and what external influences shape our personality and life decisions.  Christina Ricci is wonderful in this strong performance.  Her southern accent, big eyes and body language are amazing that make her performance flawless.  Music in the film is wonderful.

Kyle,"[8, 8]","In the racist South, the last thing an African American man needs is to find a half-naked White woman out on the road behind his home.Yet, that is exactly what bluesman Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds when he discovers Rae (Christina Ricci).  The bruises don't just cover her face, but they run deep as well. Rae's a childhood victim of sexual abuse, who sublimates her shame in nymphomania.  Laz is recovering from the ache of discovering his wife, Rose, has cheated on him--with his own brother.After meeting, the two of them take on a journey of healing together that's harsh, but very real.  There's a tenderness in Jackson putting a chain leash on Rae til she can gain some control over her own feelings--and come to realize what they mean.  You want to cheer when Rae finally confronts her mother asking her--""Why did you let him do it?  When did you know?""And Laz as well begins to learn to move on and heal his own wounds.  The differences in the two characters only highlights the fact that we all can begin again.Jackson is one of those actors who totally loses me in his role.  He can move from the assured FBI agent in ""Snakes on a Plane"" to an old, poor bluesman in the blink of an eye.  His performance is so seamless you really don't see Jackson on the screen, but who he's portraying.And Christina Ricci's part was amazing.  For the most part, she was semi-naked on film--yet her inner character was peeled back like the petals of a rose as she began to regain her dignity and cover her exterior.  This is not a role most Hollywood glam actresses would even want to try because it didn't cast her in a great light, but I think in the end she truly did triumph with her acting ability.Very well done.

646523,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JP97,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Black Snake Moan (Craig Brewer, 2006)I've been trying to figure out how to review Black Snake Moan for months and never quite came up with the proper angle. And now it's been too long since I've seen it--though I do still remember this tale of redemption through the blues very, very well--and I still don't have an angle into it, so it's time to just start typing and hope an angle presents itself. For in case you somehow haven't yet heard and have been waiting for me to hold forth on the subject, Black Snake Moan is an excellent, excellent movie that deserves to be seen by as many people as possible. This is must-see TV of the highest order, a movie that is entirely different than what you thought it was, but unlike most cases of such things, it is something indescribably better.The movie centers around the relationship between Rae (Monster's always-fetching Christina Ricci) and Lazarus (the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson). As the movie opens, Rae--horrifically abused as a child and thus now what would have been called in more proper times a ""loose woman""--has had her life turned upside-down by the news that her fiance, and the guy that keeps her stable, Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), has joined the armed forces and is shipping out. He has the best of intentions, of course--they need money to survive, even in the dirt-poor little hamlet where the story takes place--and there's none comin' in any other way. But this leads to something of a mini-breakdown for Rae, who ends up sleeping with a bunch of people, getting beaten to within an inch of her life, and abandoned on a back road--where Lazarus, a highly moral blues guitarist, comes upon her. Now, Lazarus has his own problems, seeing as his wife has recently left him for his younger brother. Against his better judgment, Lazarus takes a liking to the girl, and decides to find a way to save her--which involves wrapping her in a forty-pound chain and attaching her to a radiator. Tough love indeed, and easily misinterpreted by others.This could have--and I can't imagine how much temptation there was to make it so--ended up as some sort of low-rent kinky softcore flick. And come on, let's face it, that's exactly what the trailer promised us, with a steaming-hot Ricci wandering around in nothing but panties and a too-tight half-T-shirt, and then ending up chained (by a black man, no less) to a radiator. That's a trailer that plays on a lot of cultural tropes. As does the film, of course, but there's a whole lot of selective editing going on here to make this into a bait-and-switch. And usually when that happens, you're going to get a lot less than you bargained for; the trailer promises you cheap, kinky sex and you end up getting the barest suggestion of something that might end up being erotic. Instead, you get this pristinely-written, perfectly-acted, brilliant meditation on salvation, music, and the four types of love (you know the drill if you were raised in the Christian church, right? Eros, philos, agape, and storge?). Normally I'd be annoyed by this, but the movie is strong enough that I just sat there in awe, watching two fantastic actors in one of the most interesting situations I can imagine bringing their best work to the table--this is easily Ricci's best role since Monster and Jackson's since, well, I don't know when (The Caveman's Valentine? Eve's Bayou?). Just to add insult to injury, who knew Justin Timberlake could act? That's just one surprise in a movie full of them. This is an incredible cinematic experience.

It's a uniquely honest fable about redemption and facing our flaws.Lazarus (Samuel Jackson) is a farmer and former blues guitarist trying to deal with his own demons, stemming from his failed marriage to a younger woman who leaves him for his younger brother.. Rae is a girl with crippling self-esteem problems, she loves her boyfriend fiercely, but when he leaves for a tour in Iraq, she lets herself be passed from man to man. Lazarus finds her one morning, comatose from drugs and being beaten by her boyfriend's best 'friend' on the side of the road, and realizes that if he can help her clean up her act, he may be able to save himself.In the hands of any other director, with any other actors or actresses, this film probably would have been a complete disaster...  yet somehow it ends up being one of the most emotionally honest movies I've ever seen.

646525,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B00005JP97,Robin Friedman,"[116, 128]","I was drawn to this movie because I enjoyed director Craig Brewer's earlier film, ""Hustle and Flow"".  If anything, I liked ""Black Snake Moan"" even better.  The movie combines tawdry and lurid components with a tale of love, forgiveness, and hope.  I don't think the film is exploitative. Instead it suggests in a simple way how sensual and redemptive parts of life often complement each other.In thinking about this movie, I was reminded of George Eliot's novel, ""Silas Marner"", the bane of every high school student.  In Eliot's novel, Marner, an embittered miser finds redemption when he raises Eppie, an orphaned girl, from childhood to young adulthood. Similarly, ""Black Snake Moan"" tells the story of a middle-aged black American man, Lazarus, portrayed by Samuel Jackson, who feels embittered when Rose, his wife of 12 years, leaves him for his best friend.  Lazarus happens upon a young scantily dressed white woman, Rae, played by Christina Ricci,  who has been beaten and left near-dead on a country road following a wild party.  Lazarus takes her into his home and tries to teach and care for her.  Ultimately, the movie suggests, both Lazarus and Rae receive a kind of hope, Rae by marrying her boyfriend, Lazarus by finding what may be a promising new relationship.The story gets life through a great deal of tawdry sex.  At the turning point of the movie, Lazarus chains Rae to a radiator to prevent her escape.  Rae was a victim of sexual abuse and a neglectful mother, and in her boyfriend's temporary absence for military service, she throws herself at every man she can find. She appears in the movie scantily clad, in a cut-off blouse with a Confederate flag and in shorts. Lazarus has his own frustrations to work out from the loss of Rose, his wife.  A black preacher, the Reverend R.L., played by John Cotham, helps both Lazarus and Rae and is the quiet hero of this movie.In this movie, atmosphere and scene count for a great deal.  The story is set in a small Tennessee town near Nashville, and the story is redolent with poor Southern life, both black and white.  There is scenes in shacks and farms, and small town stores and streets, and in clubs and bars that bring the movie to life.  Brewer shows the same love for and knowledge of the rural South that he showed in ""Hustle and Flow"". Most importantly there is music.  The tale of sex and redemption is captured in the flow of the blues in a soundtrack and in performances by Lazarus himself.  Jackson spent long hours learning the blues guitar in preparation for this movie.  The movie includes two scenes of footage with the great Delta bluesman Son House holding forth appropriately on love, loss, and the blues.  Music is a redemptive force in people's lives, and in this movie of the hot-blooded South, redemption comes through the blues.I found the tawdry elements of this movie an essential part of the story it had to tell. ""Black Snake Moan"" is rewarding.Robin Friedman",5,"Love, Redemption, and Blues",1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,2957,"['was', 'drawn', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'director', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'earlier', 'film', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'anything', 'liked', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'even', 'better', 'movie', 'combines', 'tawdry', 'lurid', 'components', 'tale', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'exploitative', 'Instead', 'simple', 'way', 'how', 'sensual', 'redemptive', 'parts', 'life', 'often', 'complement', 'other.In', 'thinking', 'movie', 'was', 'reminded', 'George', 'Eliot', 'novel', 'Silas', 'Marner', 'bane', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Eliot', 'novel', 'Marner', 'embittered', 'miser', 'redemption', 'when', 'Eppie', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'childhood', 'young', 'adulthood', 'Similarly', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'story', 'middle-aged', 'black', 'American', 'man', 'Lazarus', 'portrayed', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'who', 'embittered', 'when', 'Rose', 'wife', '12', 'years', 'best', 'friend', 'Lazarus', 'young', 'scantily', 'dressed', 'white', 'woman', 'Rae', 'played', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'who', 'been', 'beaten', 'left', 'near-dead', 'country', 'road', 'following', 'wild', 'party', 'Lazarus', 'home', 'tries', 'teach', 'care', 'Ultimately', 'movie', 'Lazarus', 'Rae', 'receive', 'kind', 'hope', 'Rae', 'marrying', 'boyfriend', 'Lazarus', 'finding', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'promising', 'new', 'relationship.The', 'story', 'life', 'great', 'deal', 'tawdry', 'sex', 'turning', 'point', 'movie', 'Lazarus', 'Rae', 'radiator', 'prevent', 'escape', 'Rae', 'was', 'victim', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'neglectful', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'temporary', 'absence', 'military', 'service', 'man', 'can', 'find', 'movie', 'scantily', 'clad', 'cut-off', 'blouse', 'Confederate', 'flag', 'shorts', 'Lazarus', 'own', 'frustrations', 'work', 'out', 'loss', 'Rose', 'wife', 'black', 'preacher', 'Reverend', 'R.L.', 'played', 'John', 'Cotham', 'Lazarus', 'Rae', 'quiet', 'hero', 'movie.In', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'scene', 'count', 'great', 'deal', 'story', 'set', 'small', 'Tennessee', 'town', 'Nashville', 'story', 'redolent', 'poor', 'Southern', 'life', 'black', 'white', 'scenes', 'shacks', 'farms', 'small', 'town', 'stores', 'streets', 'clubs', 'bars', 'bring', 'movie', 'life', 'Brewer', 'same', 'love', 'knowledge', 'rural', 'South', 'showed', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'Most', 'importantly', 'music', 'tale', 'sex', 'redemption', 'captured', 'flow', 'blues', 'soundtrack', 'performances', 'Lazarus', 'Jackson', 'spent', 'long', 'hours', 'learning', 'blues', 'guitar', 'preparation', 'movie', 'movie', 'two', 'scenes', 'footage', 'great', 'Delta', 'bluesman', 'Son', 'House', 'holding', 'forth', 'appropriately', 'love', 'loss', 'blues', 'Music', 'redemptive', 'force', 'people', 'lives', 'movie', 'hot-blooded', 'South', 'redemption', 'blues.I', 'found', 'tawdry', 'elements', 'movie', 'essential', 'part', 'story', 'had', 'tell', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'rewarding.Robin', 'Friedman']",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]
646526,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JP97,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","The plot is like something out of one of those Southern-decadence melodramas by William Faulkner or Tennessee Williams:A morally righteous, blues-playing cuckold finds a scantily clad nymphomaniac beaten to a bloody pulp and left for dead on the side of the road.  He carries the initially unconscious woman to his shack where he proceeds to nurse her back to physical and spiritual health.  Oh, and, by the way, did I mention that she's chained to a radiator a good deal of the time?Based on the overheated premise and imagery alone, ""Black Snake Moan"" could easily have been either a sadomasochistic horror film or a kinky sex fantasy  (or a twisted combination of both).  Instead, writer/director Craig Brewer clearly sees this material as a return to the great Southern Gothic tradition of the literary past, replete with hints of potential madness, elaborate sexual perversion, and an undercurrent of racial tension to go along with all the heat and humidity.It is difficult to pigeonhole ""Black Snake Moan,"" for it is neither a parody of an exploitation film nor an exploitation film itself.  Very little of it is actually played for laughs, and that, I think, is what makes the movie successful in the long run.  It attacks the material with such a knowing earnestness that we are swept up into the drama despite being supremely conscious at all times of just how preposterous the whole thing is.As a thoughtful artist, Brewer uses his disturbing imagery to plumb the turbid depths of his audience`s subconscious.  The sight of a young woman helplessly chained to a radiator, for instance, inevitably conjures up images of slavery, rape, sexual and racial dominance, etc. in the viewer`s mind (the irony, of course, is that, in this case, it is the black man who has the white person in chains).  Yet, once we strip away all the aberrant imagery from the story, what we're ultimately left with is a simple tale of two bruised and potentially self-destructive individuals reaching out to one another in ways that the society around them and even they themselves don't truly understand.  The relationship between the farmer, Lazarus, and the nympho, Rae, is a richly detailed and complex one, for despite his distasteful approach, Lazarus is, in reality, a compassionate man reaching out to a stranger in need to show her that there is a better, more spiritually fulfilling way for people to live.  Through their superb performances, Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci (who has lost much of her baby-fat and moon-face and become very sexy indeed) turn what could have been two ""decadent Southern"" caricatures into fully-rounded human beings.  There are also very fine performances by Justin Timberlake, John Cothran Jr., and S. Epatha Merkerson in support of the two leads.Brewer has paced his film just right, giving the two characters time to develop their relationship amidst the more sensationalistic plot elements floating around them.  He also makes the sweltering Deep South setting an integral part of the drama.Don't let the more unsavory aspects of the imagery and the plotting scare you off this movie.  ""Black Snake Moan"" is really an inspiring and moving story about how spiritual redemption and emotional healing come through simple acts of human kindness.",4,not at all what you might expect,1186272000,"08 5, 2007",2007,3278,"['plot', 'something', 'one', 'Southern-decadence', 'melodramas', 'William', 'Faulkner', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'morally', 'righteous', 'blues-playing', 'cuckold', 'scantily', 'clad', 'nymphomaniac', 'beaten', 'bloody', 'pulp', 'left', 'dead', 'side', 'road', 'initially', 'unconscious', 'woman', 'shack', 'where', 'nurse', 'back', 'physical', 'spiritual', 'health', 'Oh', 'way', 'did', 'mention', 'chained', 'radiator', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'Based', 'overheated', 'premise', 'imagery', 'alone', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'sadomasochistic', 'horror', 'film', 'kinky', 'sex', 'fantasy', 'twisted', 'combination', 'Instead', 'writer/director', 'Craig', 'Brewer', 'clearly', 'material', 'return', 'great', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'tradition', 'literary', 'past', 'replete', 'hints', 'potential', 'madness', 'elaborate', 'sexual', 'perversion', 'undercurrent', 'racial', 'tension', 'go', 'along', 'heat', 'humidity.It', 'difficult', 'pigeonhole', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'parody', 'exploitation', 'film', 'exploitation', 'film', 'Very', 'little', 'actually', 'played', 'laughs', 'think', 'what', 'movie', 'successful', 'long', 'run', 'material', 'knowing', 'earnestness', 'are', 'swept', 'up', 'drama', 'being', 'supremely', 'conscious', 'times', 'just', 'how', 'preposterous', 'whole', 'thing', 'is.As', 'thoughtful', 'artist', 'Brewer', 'disturbing', 'imagery', 'plumb', 'turbid', 'depths', 'audience', 's', 'subconscious', 'sight', 'young', 'woman', 'helplessly', 'chained', 'radiator', 'instance', 'inevitably', 'up', 'images', 'slavery', 'rape', 'sexual', 'racial', 'dominance', 'etc', 'viewer', 's', 'mind', 'irony', 'course', 'case', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'white', 'person', 'chains', 'once', 'strip', 'away', 'aberrant', 'imagery', 'story', 'what', ""'re"", 'ultimately', 'left', 'simple', 'tale', 'two', 'bruised', 'potentially', 'self-destructive', 'individuals', 'reaching', 'one', 'ways', 'society', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'truly', 'understand', 'relationship', 'farmer', 'Lazarus', 'nympho', 'Rae', 'richly', 'detailed', 'complex', 'one', 'distasteful', 'approach', 'Lazarus', 'reality', 'compassionate', 'man', 'reaching', 'out', 'stranger', 'need', 'show', 'better', 'more', 'spiritually', 'fulfilling', 'way', 'people', 'live', 'superb', 'performances', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'who', 'lost', 'much', 'baby-fat', 'moon-face', 'become', 'very', 'sexy', 'indeed', 'turn', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'decadent', 'Southern', 'fully-rounded', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'fine', 'performances', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'John', 'Cothran', 'Jr.', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Merkerson', 'support', 'two', 'leads.Brewer', 'paced', 'film', 'just', 'right', 'giving', 'two', 'characters', 'time', 'develop', 'relationship', 'more', 'sensationalistic', 'plot', 'elements', 'floating', 'also', 'sweltering', 'Deep', 'South', 'setting', 'integral', 'part', 'drama.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'more', 'unsavory', 'aspects', 'imagery', 'plotting', 'scare', 'off', 'movie', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'really', 'inspiring', 'moving', 'story', 'how', 'spiritual', 'redemption', 'emotional', 'healing', 'come', 'simple', 'acts', 'human', 'kindness']",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]

Now, if you were a 50-something man (Samuel L. Jackson) trying to rescue this pitiable lost soul, wouldn't you get some clothes on the child as soon as possible?But that can't happen until well past the first hour of the flick because it's more important that we see a naked woman writhing around whilst being bound about her waist with heavy iron chains and an antique padlock. Perhaps there are men who relish the idea of seeing a nearly naked Christine Ricci chained to the radiator in *their* dining room, but I found it all pretty distasteful. Not to mention, I believe such actions can be prosecuted as a felony.It felt more like I was watching a triple-X flick than a mainstream movie. Black Snake Moan has some redeeming qualities and features, and the plot had the potential to be quite interesting and even enchanting, but the overt sexual nature of this movie left me feeling more like I'd just watched a two-hour porn flick, with a plot stuck in the middle as an afterthought.And what about the violence against women? Is this the only way to salvage and save a lost soul like ""Rae"" (Christina Ricci)? Bind her with iron shackles and let her scream the demons out?

Laz is left bitter and alone, with nothing to fill him except his love of playing the blues.Rae Doole, (Christina Ricci) has a $exual addiction disorder.  When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) leaves to join the military, Rae gets one of her ""attacks"" and goes on the prowl.  One of Ronnie's friends gets his hands on her and beats the cr@p out of her, leaving Rae on the side of the road out near Laz's house.  When Laz finds her the next morning, he takes her inside and steels himself to cure her of her demons while he fights his own.There's some controversy over kidnapping, what with Laz chaining Rae to keep her from running off again, but somehow the movie works itself out and away from any evil involved in the action.Can Rae change her ways?  Can Ronnie overcome his anxiety issues?  Can Laz exorcise his own demons?  The plot comes out as the weaker point in this film, giving way to stellar performances by Christina Ricci and Samuel Jackson.  Even Justin Timberlake does a decent job.  Jackson and Ricci do their own singing in the film, without dubbing in other voices.

Wow.In Black Snake Moan Christina Ricci is a sex-addicted Southern Girl that crosses paths with an aging Blues singer that takes her in and tries to get her life turned around...albeit against her will. Now that might not sound like the most thrilling movie of the year, but up until the last 20 - 30 or so minutes of the movie I was thinking that Black Snake Moan should get a Globe or Oscar nod.An air of suspense throughout the film never lets up with that something-really-bad-is-about-to-happen feeling. And indeed sometimes something bad does happen, but ultimately Black Snake Moan turns into a feel good movie (for adults). It's sometimes warm and funny, and it certainly has its violent moments...not to mention some pretty strong sex scenes that you don't normally see a leading lady like Ricci participate in on film.While the movie won't lead to a Samuel L. Jackson singing career, he ain't that bad of a blues singer. Funny thing about Jackson is that he plays pretty much the same character in every single movie that he's in...which is such a cool character; it just seems to work in everything he does from Pulp Fiction to Star Wars to S.W.A.T. to Black Snake Moan. In Black Snake Moan it's like watching an aged Jules WinnfieldPulp Fiction (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)singin' the Blues.The final quarter of the movie seems hastily put together and a bit predictable. And the entire movie is a little bit of stretch considering how receptive Ricci's character (and others) becomes to her forced situation with Jackson's character.But overall, the movie is very good.

646540,A39239F78V03U4,B00005JP97,Steve Bradford,"[1, 1]","Craig Brewer's Deep South gothic, `Black Snake Moan' is both an intriguing and raw study in contrasts that go beyond the color of skin. Christina Ricci's plays the troubled Rae, a young white-trash girl whose persona is one of booze, drugs, illicit sex. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) leaves for the Army, Rae jumps at the opportunity to have sex with the town's drug dealer. Later, after a party filled with drugs, alcohol, naked football, and sex with various participants, Rae gets a ride, and a serious beating, by Ronnie's friend Gil (Michael Raymond-James). She is found the next day by Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson), an old farmer and blues player who just found out his wife has left him for his younger brother. A spiritual man with a heavy heart, he takes in the young Rae and, after cleaning and bandaging her wounds, he soon discovers Rae's nymphet ways though the small town chatter mill. Lazarus' budding relationship with a drug store pharmacist Angela (S. Epatha Merkerson of `Law & Order' fame) is then tested when she discovers Rae is associated with him. A twisted character study soon begins to intertwine within itself.Chris Brewer's script is both sensationally direct and very visually appealing. His uses of un-Hollywood camera angles only add to the appeal. Christina Ricci's acting is impressive while Samuel L. Jackson's character is revealing throughout the movie. Both John Cothran and Justin Timberlake play convincing and believable parts. Co-Producer John Singleton made a good choice in associating himself with this endeavor.`Black Snake Moan' is neither a porno (although there is nudity)nor a racist expose.

Hustle n Flow was about a man with a dream, Black Snake Moan is about what happens to those who no longer have them.This film is energized from beginning to end with the kind of images that will excite your senses and perhaps even make you a bit uncomfortable. If the thought of an intimidating black man chaining up a white woman to his radiator doesn't quite fit with your world perspective then this film is clearly not for you.  Samuel L. Jackson is Lazerus, a man who just lost his wife of many years to another man. He speaks with the kind of authority and thunder that can only come out of the bible days. When he speaks other characters listen and that's just how it goes.  Christina Ricci plays Ray a girl who wants nothing more then to just stay at home with her lover, played by Justin Timberlake, but when he goes off to war she goes into one of her many nymphomaniac fits and eagerly seeks out the most nearby rod on which to satisfy her urges. After one particularly bad night of drinking and sex she ends up on Lazerus' doorstep, beaten and knocked out, this is where both of their lives will change forever.There are some very strong images in this film, besides of course the obvious one of Ray tied up in chains. Its like the south is getting revenge for all those years of slavery. It's a racially charged image and when it hits you you're not quite sure what to do with it. Even more so when she embraces them in order to calm down one of her carnal fits. Sexual tension is ripe in the air as Ray tries to tempt the noble Lazerus who finds enough strength to turn down her advances and try to truly help this lost soul. Lazerus never comes off righteous as he even admits to Ray that he is not a perfect man, in one particular scene he goes into a fit mistaking Ray for his wife ranting and yelling at her because he just couldn't hold onto her. Strangely now he gets his control over this one particular woman, although of course with the best of intentions.These are just a few of the many underlying themes explored in the film. The situation itself is downright absurd but it's used to such amazing effect that it truly is the best way to explore the places most films dare not tread. Another strong point in the film is the music, its electric, it soulful and haunting. The blues is a living breathing element and theirs a reason the characters sing it and you can see them live it in every frame. Even Ray gets her chance to let out her woes in one very simple yet beautiful scene where she sings the only song she knows, ""this little light of mine."" Somehow within the confines of all this imagery the film manages to create some very real and lovely characters. Lazerus and Ray have formed a bond that will last a lifetime.The film is shot like its straight out of a pulp comic book. The south is never stylized but it comes off raw and carries within it a spark of blood and dirt in every scene.  It's got strong characters and a well-written script.

646545,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JP97,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[87, 101]","So, let me get this straight. The Deep South. A young, white woman (Christina Ricci) who is also a nymphomaniac, ends up on the doorstep of an aging, black blues singer (Samuel L. Jackson) and he decides to chain her to his radiator. Have I returned to another era of filmmaking? When I first heard about this story, I did a double take. ""Black Snake Moan"" could be very bad; there are a lot of inherent problems with this story. Or it could be very good; the synopsis has so many weird, uncommon elements that it almost guarantees it will be something wonderful. I am happy to report the latter is true.I didn't love ""Hustle and Flow"", writer - director Craig Brewer's last film, but I liked it. I just wasn't won over by the story of a pimp who wants to become a rapper. If there's anything we learned from the film its ""Don't you know it's hard out there for a pimp"".So when I first heard about ""Black Snake Moan"", Brewer's follow-up, I was not excited. Then I started to really pay attention to the previews and the images. Okay, this is going to be one strange movie and sometimes strange movies are beautiful because they have a license to go places we don't expect. ""Black Snake Moan"" is all of these things; strange, beautiful and also contains great performances from Jackson (one of his best) and Ricci (certainly her best).The first thing ""Black Snake"" does is set up the two main characters, establishing their lives, before they meet. This may sound like a given, but Brewer spends a significant amount of time showing the despair each person has in their lives, for different reasons, giving us a chance to get to know each of them.Rae (Ricci) begs her boyfriend Ronnie, (Justin Timberlake) to not go to Basic Training. But he has to go, this is the only way they are ever going to escape the trailer park they live in and have a chance to escape their white trash roots. She runs after the truck in her daisy dukes and oversize flannel shirt and then drops to the ground, crying. As soon as he is gone, she gets the `itch', something she is only occasionally able to control. This time, she won't be able to control it. She calls up the local small time drug dealer, a black man, and they are soon going at it in a seedy motel room. Later, she attends a large party, wearing the same daisy dukes and a cut off t-shirt bearing the Confederate flag (really just a strip of cloth making a valiant effort to cover her breasts, frequently giving up the fight) and tries to hook up. With anyone and everyone. Unable to find someone, she takes some pills and before you can whistle Dixie, she is running around in her panties and a football guard playing a game of football with some friends. Before you know it, she is having sex on the lawn, amid hundreds of used plastic cups. Later, she ends up with a bloody nose on the dirt road outside of Lazarus' small farm.Lazarus (Jackson) has troubles of his own. A former Blues musician, he learns his wife has been cheating on him with his brother. She wants to leave, but his brother won't leave without his blessing. Lazarus shows great restraint in a confrontation between them. The local preacher, a childhood friend, tries to offer him guidance, but Lazarus won't have any of it. Returning home drunk, he throws all of his wife's possessions into a garbage bag before passing out. The next morning, he takes the garbage bags out to the trash and spots the young girl. He soon realizes she is hurt and tries to figure out what to do. If he calls for help, he will be immediately blamed and may end up in jail. He decides to take her in and help her. He visits the local pharmacist, Angela (S. Epatha Merkerson, TV's ""Law and Order"") and she gives him some cough medicine for `his niece's' cough.Fading in and out of consciousness, Lazarus helps her get rid of her cough and tries to help with the black eye and the cuts and bruises. In a moment of lucidity, she attacks Lazarus, trying to tame her `itch' and have sex with him, leading him to find out about her  nymphomania. In order to control her, he chains her to the radiator.When she comes to, wearing her panties and t-shirt, she assumes something happened, but he assures her it didn't. Well, if he wants to, he can, as long as he lets her go. He won't have any of it. He has to help her.This only begins to scratch he surface of ""Black Snake Moan"". Because the film is basically about these two characters, and we spend a significant amount of time with them, we learn a lot about each. But it is a testament to each actor that these moments of knowledge come through their performances, one of Jackon's best and certainly Ricci's best to date.Christina Ricci deserves a lot of credit for the simple rawness of the performance. There aren't many actresses that would take on this type of role, let alone abandon themselves to the character. Rae is half nude throughout most of the film. Naturally, this character, a woman so loose with her sexuality, so promiscuous, would find nudity a natural thing. And the character does bare her breasts a few times. She also has sex with more than one person. But all of these images are presented in a very matter-of-fact way and illustrate the character's soullessness. When she meets Lazarus and he starts to care for her, this behavior stops, because he won't allow it. Gradually, as she realizes he cares for her, she starts to listen to him. She doesn't change completely, or quickly, making the character seem all the more natural.This performance is very raw and fitting for the character. Ricci seems to give everything she has to the role, making it a memorable, vibrant performance. When she starts to change, we have lived part of the journey with her and we feel as though we have changed with her.Samuel L. Jackson also seems to lose in the role of Lazarus. Every time we go to a movie, we may recognize the actors playing the role. Not surprisingly, the less famous an actor, the more easily they `become' the character they are playing because we are more likely to forget they are an actor playing a role. Samuel L. Jackson has made many films, many of those very popular, so he is very recognizable. An established actor always has more difficulty disappearing into the character. But Jackson seems to disappear into this character for large stretches of time, allowing me to forget I was watching the famous actor who has also appeared in ""Pulp Fiction "", ""Snakes on a Plane"" and many others. The fact that he can fully immerse himself into the character at all speaks to his ability to make this character seem real.From the moment we first meet him, we experience some of the troubles Lazarus has with his community, with his wife, with his life. When he finds Ricci on the dirt road, he has to help her. But he has to be cautious. It wouldn't look good for an aging black man to be seen with a half naked white woman, let alone one who has been beaten up. So he looks both ways, to make sure no one is watching and takes her inside.The more involved he gets in her recovery, the more we realize he needed such a `project' to give meaning to his life. This also brings him into contact with the pharmacist, a woman who clearly has a little `itch' of her own for the aging Blues singer. Throughout the course of the story, Lazarus heals through his interactions with the young lady and may be able to get his life back on track after all.Justin Timberlake is also good as, Ricci's boyfriend. Going beyond stunt casting, he actually shows he has some acting chops as he makes the character's difficulties real and substantive.""Black Snake Moan"" is a simply made film. The action centers at Lazarus' small farm in the middle of nowhere. Occasionally, he goes into town or other characters come out to the farm and interact with him, but I can't imagine this film cost a lot of money to make. Which makes sense because I am pretty sure if the budget for this film were too high, it never would have been made.I'm glad ""Black Snake Moan"" was made, because it contains two great performances, introducing us to characters we have never seen before, and likely are not to see often again. It is also a believable, well-made tale of redemption for two people who need to have some meaning in their lives.This strange film is, at times, quite a beautiful film.",4,"""Snake"" and a

646546,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00005JP97,Todd Smith,"[1, 3]","Samuel L. Jackson is legendary and he has the unique ability to turn even a strange movie like this, into something that is worth watching. Black Snake Moan is a really ridiculous story, full of odd symbolism that just really doesn't make any sense. Jackson plays Lazarus, a loner who lives on a farm in the middle of nowhere. He's a deeply religious man, whose wife just left him for his brother. Lazarus responded to this by locking himself away and putting all he has into his farm. One morning he finds a badly beaten girl, with a reputation, laying in the road and decides to help her, but he soon comes to believe that this girl is possessed and that God sent her too him for help. Not knowing what to do, Lazarus takes this sex crazed, drug addict and chains her to the wall of his house. Throughout this film, there are all kinds of symbols that don't make any sense. There are scenes featuring an old blues singer talking nonsense, scenes of the town that we almost never see, and perhaps strangest of all, there are moles added to Jackson's face, something you don't see except it cases of a biography. As for the performances, they were terrific, This is the best performance I've ever seen Christina Ricci give and she really gave Jackson a run for his money. Jackson, was also great, giving what you expect to see from him, albeit with less swearing than usual. The performances were really the only thing this film did have going for it as the events that take place just don't make any sense. The film jumps around, leaving things unfinished, and personalities seem to change as often as the wind blows. It's a pet peeve of mine, but I really hate when great performances are wasted on a film that is so poorly written, that it's almost unwatchable. Black Snake Moan is sloppy, jumps around without finishing things, and at times just doesn't make sense. It was an interesting idea with a terrific cast, but the people behind it were clearly in way over their head and just didn't really seem to know where they were going or even what they were doing.",2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,2067,"['Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'legendary', 'unique', 'ability', 'turn', 'even', 'strange', 'movie', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'story', 'full', 'odd', 'symbolism', 'just', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Jackson', 'Lazarus', 'loner', 'who', 'farm', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'deeply', 'religious', 'man', 'wife', 'just', 'left', 'brother', 'Lazarus', 'responded', 'locking', 'away', 'putting', 'farm', 'One', 'morning', 'badly', 'beaten', 'girl', 'reputation', 'laying', 'road', 'help', 'soon', 'believe', 'girl', 'possessed', 'God', 'sent', 'too', 'help', 'Not', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'Lazarus', 'sex', 'crazed', 'drug', 'addict', 'wall', 'house', 'film', 'are', 'kinds', 'symbols', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'are', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'old', 'blues', 'singer', 'talking', 'nonsense', 'scenes', 'town', 'almost', 'never', 'see', 'perhaps', 'strangest', 'are', 'moles', 'added', 'Jackson', 'face', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'cases', 'biography', 'performances', 'were', 'terrific', 'best', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'give', 'really', 'gave', 'Jackson', 'run', 'money', 'Jackson', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'giving', 'what', 'expect', 'see', 'less', 'swearing', 'usual', 'performances', 'were', 'really', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'did', 'have', 'going', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'film', 'jumps', 'around', 'leaving', 'things', 'unfinished', 'personalities', 'seem', 'change', 'as', 'often', 'wind', 'pet', 'peeve', 'mine', 'really', 'hate', 'when', 'great', 'performances', 'are', 'wasted', 'film', 'so', 'poorly', 'written', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'sloppy', 'jumps', 'finishing', 'things', 'times', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'was', 'interesting', 'idea', 'terrific', 'cast', 'people', 'were', 'clearly', 'way', 'head', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'know', 'where', 'were', 'going', 'even', 'what', 'were', 'doing']",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]
646547,A1J409V5FZ44Z7,B00005JP97,Todd Sullivan,"[9, 10]","""Black Snake Moan"" isn't a perfect movie. I am definitely not a fan of Justin Timerlake, as a singer or an actor. I find it weird that the makers of this film would really think Timberlake was the best person to play the part of Rae's boyfriend.For the most part, however, I find this movie enjoyable because it is differnt from what is normally available in the theatres.

646551,A1ABOWFWGL9HQC,B00005JP97,"wahzoh ""wahzoh""","[2, 2]","I knew I had to see this movie when I first saw the advertising art cruising past me on the side of a Los Angeles Transit Bus.  A sweaty Samuel L. Jackson clutching a thick chain, while a near-naked Christina Ricci crawled on the floor.  ""Yup"", I said to myself,  ""this looks unusual"".  I know this isn't a feminist-correct thing to say, but I swore right then and there to pay my $6 just to endorse the ad art.  Since that time, I have acquired the DVD, and I still think that ""Black Snake Moan"" is a most unusual picture.This is not a movie for the faint-hearted in many ways.  Ricci's character, Rae, is a truly degraded soul - she can't drink enough or have enough sex to make her pain go away.  It's not presented as theory, either - you have to watch this young woman doing some pretty rank stuff.  I personally wanted to take some strong action to sober her up and straighten her out.  Thankfully, Jackson's character, Lazarus, took care of this for me -- ""I aim to heal you of your wickedness,"" he says to her, and that's a good thing.Most of the action in this movie takes place in a pretty limited physical space - Lazarus' cabin.  It realy does seem in some ways as though it could have been a stage play - maybe that's why so many people have remarked that it has a Tenneessee Williams feel to it.  I kind of wish it had been written as a stage play - I would have been interested to see what interpretations a variety of actors would have brought to these roles.The other reviews on this site will pretty much explain the rest of the picture.  Some people apparently feel that the ending is unbelievable -- a bit too pat and happy.  Me, I liked it -- heck, the entire film is unbelievable.  Why complain about the happy ending?  The blues music was wonderful -- there's a sequence where Lazarus is playing his guitar while a lightning storm goes on outside his cabin and Raew sits on the floor, clutching his leg.  Wow, that was a fine sequence.One reviewer here remarked on the ""unrealistic"" fact that Ricci's underwear/costume stayed white throughout and did not get all grimey.  Personally, I appreciated that.  I don't think that costuming choice on the director's part was pornographic - it was more like a courtesy to the viewers.  There's enough grime and sweat in this picture, why add to it?  Maybe the perpetually white underwear was symbolic of her basically pure soul.  Or maybe not.Great ad art, great music, clean underwear, lots of sweat and a happy ending.  That's about it.  Except that this is a film for grown-ups.",5,"Nasty, Gritty, Sweaty  Redemption",1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,2546,"['knew', 'had', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'advertising', 'art', 'cruising', 'side', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Transit', 'Bus', 'A', 'sweaty', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'clutching', 'thick', 'chain', 'near-naked', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'crawled', 'floor', 'Yup', 'said', 'myself', 'unusual', 'know', ""n't"", 'feminist-correct', 'thing', 'say', 'swore', 'right', 'then', 'there', 'pay', '6', 'just', 'endorse', 'ad', 'art', 'time', 'have', 'acquired', 'DVD', 'still', 'think', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'most', 'unusual', 'picture.This', 'not', 'movie', 'faint-hearted', 'many', 'ways', 'Ricci', 'character', 'Rae', 'truly', 'degraded', 'soul', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drink', 'enough', 'have', 'enough', 'sex', 'make', 'pain', 'go', 'away', 'not', 'presented', 'theory', 'have', 'watch', 'young', 'woman', 'doing', 'pretty', 'rank', 'stuff', 'personally', 'wanted', 'take', 'strong', 'action', 'sober', 'up', 'straighten', 'out', 'Thankfully', 'Jackson', 'character', 'Lazarus', 'took', 'care', 'aim', 'heal', 'wickedness', 'good', 'thing.Most', 'action', 'movie', 'place', 'pretty', 'limited', 'physical', 'space', 'Lazarus', 'cabin', 'realy', 'seem', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stage', 'play', 'maybe', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'remarked', 'Tenneessee', 'Williams', 'feel', 'kind', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'stage', 'play', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'interpretations', 'variety', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'brought', 'roles.The', 'other', 'reviews', 'site', 'will', 'pretty', 'much', 'explain', 'rest', 'picture', 'people', 'apparently', 'feel', 'ending', 'unbelievable', 'bit', 'too', 'pat', 'happy', 'Me', 'liked', 'heck', 'entire', 'film', 'unbelievable', 'Why', 'complain', 'happy', 'ending', 'blues', 'music', 'was', 'wonderful', 'sequence', 'where', 'Lazarus', 'playing', 'guitar', 'lightning', 'storm', 'cabin', 'Raew', 'sits', 'floor', 'clutching', 'leg', 'Wow', 'was', 'fine', 'sequence.One', 'reviewer', 'here', 'remarked', 'unrealistic', 'fact', 'Ricci', 'underwear/costume', 'stayed', 'white', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'grimey', 'Personally', 'appreciated', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'costuming', 'choice', 'director', 'part', 'was', 'pornographic', 'was', 'more', 'courtesy', 'viewers', 'enough', 'grime', 'sweat', 'picture', 'why', 'add', 'Maybe', 'perpetually', 'white', 'underwear', 'was', 'symbolic', 'basically', 'pure', 'soul', 'maybe', 'not.Great', 'ad', 'art', 'great', 'music', 'clean', 'underwear', 'lots', 'sweat', 'happy', 'ending', 'film', 'grown-ups']",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]

Well, on the surface it does appear to be that, but it is so much more - Black Snake Moan is a southern tale embedded in blues music, and portrays a very real human drama of two tormented souls that heal each other, albeit in an uncoventional manner. Samuel L Jackson , in one of his best performances since Pulp Fiction , portrays a god-fearing man, Lazarus, who finds a half-naked young hussy, Rae [sexy, amazing Christina Ricci] on the road near his house and takes her in to nurse her...only he finds that Rae's wounds go way beneath the superficial, and it is her soul and spirit that need nurturing and healing. When Rae decides to bolt, Lazarus chains her to a radiator [!], and eventually a grudging acceptance develops, and in healing Rae, Lazarus finds his own redemption and salvation. Despite the torrid background [Ricci is half-naked in most scenes in the movie] & the foul-mouthed Lazarus, there is a poetic beauty to this movie...the pain of the main characters is altogether palpable, and one can't help empathise with their respective plights, and there is even humor, though of the darker variety...all in all, a very watchable human drama with sexy undertones that don't really seem exploitative to me, just a means of enhancing the story.",5,Riveting performances from Jackson & Ricci,1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,1398,"['honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'first', 'viewed', 'movie', 'trailer', 'seemed', 'lurid', 'suggested', 'sexy', 'exploitative', 'movie', 'Well', 'surface', 'appear', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Black', 'Snake', 'Moan', 'southern', 'tale', 'embedded', 'blues', 'music', 'very', 'real', 'human', 'drama', 'two', 'tormented', 'souls', 'heal', 'other', 'uncoventional', 'manner', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'god-fearing', 'man', 'Lazarus', 'who', 'half-naked', 'young', 'hussy', 'Rae', '[', 'sexy', 'amazing', 'Christina', 'Ricci', ']', 'road', 'house', 'nurse', 'only', 'Rae', 'wounds', 'go', 'way', 'superficial', 'soul', 'spirit', 'need', 'nurturing', 'healing', 'When', 'Rae', 'bolt', 'Lazarus', 'radiator', '[', ']', 'eventually', 'grudging', 'acceptance', 'develops', 'healing', 'Rae', 'Lazarus', 'own', 'redemption', 'salvation', 'torrid', 'background', '[', 'Ricci', 'half-naked', 'most', 'scenes', 'movie', ']', 'foul-mouthed', 'Lazarus', 'poetic', 'beauty', 'movie', 'pain', 'main', 'characters', 'altogether', 'palpable', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'empathise', 'respective', 'plights', 'even', 'humor', 'darker', 'variety', 'very', 'watchable', 'human', 'drama', 'sexy', 'undertones', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'exploitative', 'just', 'means', 'enhancing', 'story']",Black Snake Moan [Theatrical Release]
