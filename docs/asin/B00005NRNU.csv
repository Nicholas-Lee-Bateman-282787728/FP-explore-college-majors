669899,A1VY688L9N9QXD,B00005NRNU,A. Chopra,"[28, 31]","This movie is based on a true story of Paul Castellano, who ruled the Manhattan in 1970s with construction unions and real estates funded by the money he earned from the illegal activities of the Gambino crime family. After becoming the head of the crime family, his resistance to involve in drugs and crimes made many people down the chain unhappy. John Gotti was one of them, who later assassinate Castellano and rose to power.The movie is considered dull and slow, but I don't agree. If you are looking for some ""Steven Seagal"" kind of action, then just forget it. If you have liked Godfather, Scarface, and Gotti, then you definitely won't mind adding this to your collection too. Chazz Palminteri, just played the role of head of crime family brilliantly. His dialogue delivery is perfect for this kind of movie and role. The movie is real and has some powerful moments.

Not so good, what really made me hate this movie was the assassination, they did not show when Gotti was communicating with the hitmen threw walkie talkies, it only showed when he saw the hit, plus the hit was just wrong! the gunman walked slowly and shoot him and nobody was around it looked like it was like @ 3 in the mourning.

669907,A2X5KNITHSIB3H,B00005NRNU,Jennifer Howard,"[5, 13]","Grant it 'Gotti' was a little wrong with the size of Paul Castellano but still - Chazz Palminteri offers the nice view of Paul Castellano as the loveable Mafia boss who's not a real fighter but a 'lover' - by doing this like in every book written about a famous person ... the key person is always made into a hero.Same with the HBO movie 'Gotti' which was based on Jerry Caprici's co-author book ""GOTTI: Rise and Fall"" and then there is ""Witness to the Mob"" which is the HBO version of Salvatore Gravano's ""Underboss.""In fact 'Boss of Bosses' was based on the book written by the two FBI agents who helped 'bug' Castellano's Todht Hill mansion. And in the book these two agents come to enjoy his pressence (this happened right when the FBI in the movie arrested him and their conversation in the car) right before he got murdered afront of Sparks Steak House in Manhatten.In the movie this scene was shot in the agents' car but according to the book - the scene actually took place in the back of Castellano's favorite deli - where they were eating some deli and whatnot.The other problem was how they broke into Castellano's house - they didn't show how they got the information of where to put what - and in reality they had an agent ask to use their phone (which they gladly gave the okay too) and then his simple instructions other than too make an call was to remember everything in the house.They also didn't jump over a wall - this would've meant that the alarms which I believe in the book said would go off in 2 minutes - I think he had motion sensors, so in reality they had to basically go over the roof and then into one of the windows -so they didn't just go through the front door. That would've game them away right?Also when Carlo Gambino died - he didn't die in this big mansion - he died watching a Yankees game in his very modest house on Long Island. So that was wrong ... in fact from the picture I got from Gravano's book that - Neil Dellacroce was the one that died in the big mansion.And when they showed the hit of Castellano - Gotti was in the car with Gravano not some overweight man! Last time I checked Gravano wasn't that overweight!So these 3 stars are just for Palminteri's performance as the loveable Big Paulie ... keep up the good work.",3,Dunno ...

669914,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,B00005NRNU,Pork Chop,"[0, 1]","BOSS OF BOSSES (2001)is a valuable movie, above all for itshistorical and educational aspects, in portraying the underworld inAmerica.Admittedly, the plot is somewhat superficial, and in some waysimplausible. For exmaple, much attention and time is  spentdetailing the intimate relationship between Paul Castellano (PC) andthe cleaning lady of his large home.  The director's goal surely wasto make the movie more interesting,  and the protagonist more human,less one-dimensional, yet it seems contrived, with other personaldetails unfortunately, few and far between.Among the best talent  is  Chazz Palminteri playing PC, of theGambino family, having inherited the title after the natural deathof the founder; coupled with Mark Margolis and Richard Foronjy asconsiglieri or caporegimes. William DeMeo (who seems to specializein mobster movies) makes an appearance as does the interestingPatricia Mauceri playing PC's wife.The theory of the movie, is that a bunch of childhood pals who grewup together in the neighboorhood during the Great Depression, werenaturally inclined towards the rackets of gambling, prostitution,smuggling, extortion, loansharking and the collecting of bad debtsfor monetary and power reasons, in an  under-policed underworld ofNYC. The usual baseball bat aggressions, territory defending, etc ispresent.A controversial strategy of this picture, is to sanitize completely,PC. FIrst, that PC was the ""honest"", ""gentle hearted"" and""accountant/ intellectual"" of the Gambinos.  That over time, he wasexposed only to a limited extent to the Machevellian tactics thatwere used over 50 years for fear, mind-control and authority amongthe population in general, and over the grassroot soldiers ingeneral, to be maintained. He is shown preventing his own kids fromgetting involved and following in his foot steps, and to beremorseful of past excesses.Another theory, is that Castello was a corporate, white collar -minded man, who wanted to run the organization low profile,low-risk, in legitimate businesses, expecting the grassroots peopleto be like minded, with unlimited discipline, patience, intellectualcapacity, as he did. Oh, Oh. Thus,  a recognized skill, of thetop man, was  diversifying investments among legitimate businesses,yet controlling the unions, since it allowed the influencing of theoutcome of awarding construction contracts.Another theory, is the suggestion that Gotti legitimately dealt adeath blow to PC, because Gotti decided  to kill rather than bekilled, for violating the rule prohibiting cocaine trafficking.The visual quality of the picture, although adequate and clear forTV, is not suitable for theatres and feels diluted when seen in aDVD release.The soundtrack is adequate, if not, repetitive, lacking imagination,and stereotypical.

The technology allowed audio and videosurveillance from a distance,  wireless bugs, and cameras equippedwith powerful zooms, phone taps easy to carry out, by contactingtelcom companies and hooking into their phone switches, coupled withdouble agents, such as Donnie Brasco, that is referenced. The FBI isshows as being as as skilled, if not more so, than the bad guys, atpicking locks, etc.Consequently, with PC at the reigns of power, a number ofquestionable decisions are made at the top that impoverishes theprestige and image of the godfather, the fear and respect that hispredecessor had imposed on the members, resulting in a frailedleadership based on a keeness for running the family as acorporation.",3,A lot of historical and educational aspects,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",2008,3643,"['BOSS', 'OF', 'BOSSES', '2001', 'valuable', 'movie', 'itshistorical', 'educational', 'aspects', 'portraying', 'underworld', 'inAmerica.Admittedly', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'superficial', 'waysimplausible', 'exmaple', 'much', 'attention', 'time', 'spentdetailing', 'intimate', 'relationship', 'Paul', 'Castellano', 'PC', 'andthe', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'large', 'home', 'director', 'goal', 'surely', 'wasto', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'interesting', 'protagonist', 'more', 'human', 'less', 'one-dimensional', 'contrived', 'other', 'personaldetails', 'unfortunately', 'few', 'far', 'between.Among', 'best', 'talent', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'playing', 'PC', 'theGambino', 'family', 'having', 'inherited', 'title', 'natural', 'deathof', 'founder', 'coupled', 'Mark', 'Margolis', 'Richard', 'Foronjy', 'asconsiglieri', 'caporegimes', 'William', 'DeMeo', 'who', 'specializein', 'mobster', 'movies', 'appearance', 'interestingPatricia', 'Mauceri', 'playing', 'PC', 'wife.The', 'theory', 'movie', 'bunch', 'childhood', 'pals', 'who', 'grewup', 'together', 'neighboorhood', 'Great', 'Depression', 'werenaturally', 'inclined', 'rackets', 'gambling', 'prostitution', 'smuggling', 'extortion', 'loansharking', 'collecting', 'bad', 'debtsfor', 'monetary', 'power', 'reasons', 'under-policed', 'underworld', 'ofNYC', 'usual', 'baseball', 'bat', 'aggressions', 'territory', 'defending', 'etc', 'ispresent.A', 'controversial', 'strategy', 'picture', 'sanitize', 'completely', 'PC', 'FIrst', 'PC', 'was', 'honest', 'gentle', 'hearted', 'accountant/', 'intellectual', 'Gambinos', 'time', 'wasexposed', 'only', 'limited', 'extent', 'Machevellian', 'tactics', 'thatwere', 'used', '50', 'years', 'fear', 'mind-control', 'authority', 'amongthe', 'population', 'general', 'grassroot', 'soldiers', 'ingeneral', 'be', 'maintained', 'shown', 'preventing', 'own', 'kids', 'fromgetting', 'involved', 'following', 'foot', 'steps', 'beremorseful', 'past', 'excesses.Another', 'theory', 'Castello', 'was', 'corporate', 'white', 'collar', '-minded', 'man', 'who', 'wanted', 'run', 'organization', 'low', 'profile', 'low-risk', 'legitimate', 'businesses', 'expecting', 'grassroots', 'peopleto', 'be', 'minded', 'unlimited', 'discipline', 'patience', 'intellectualcapacity', 'did', 'Oh', 'Oh', 'Thus', 'recognized', 'skill', 'thetop', 'man', 'was', 'diversifying', 'investments', 'legitimate', 'businesses', 'yet', 'controlling', 'unions', 'allowed', 'influencing', 'theoutcome', 'awarding', 'construction', 'contracts.Another', 'theory', 'suggestion', 'Gotti', 'legitimately', 'dealt', 'adeath', 'blow', 'PC', 'Gotti', 'decided', 'kill', 'rather', 'bekilled', 'violating', 'rule', 'prohibiting', 'cocaine', 'trafficking.The', 'visual', 'quality', 'picture', 'adequate', 'clear', 'forTV', 'not', 'suitable', 'theatres', 'feels', 'diluted', 'when', 'seen', 'aDVD', 'release.The', 'soundtrack', 'adequate', 'not', 'repetitive', 'lacking', 'imagination', 'stereotypical', 'More', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'humordepartment', 'also.An', 'aspect', 'important', 'accurate', 'were', 'changed', 'times', '1980', 'compared', '1933', 'technology', 'allowed', 'audio', 'videosurveillance', 'distance', 'wireless', 'bugs', 'cameras', 'equippedwith', 'powerful', 'zooms', 'phone', 'taps', 'easy', 'carry', 'out', 'contactingtelcom', 'companies', 'hooking', 'phone', 'switches', 'coupled', 'withdouble', 'agents', 'such', 'Donnie', 'Brasco', 'referenced', 'FBI', 'as', 'being', 'skilled', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'bad', 'guys', 'atpicking', 'locks', 'etc.Consequently', 'PC', 'reigns', 'power', 'number', 'ofquestionable', 'decisions', 'are', 'made', 'top', 'theprestige', 'image', 'godfather', 'fear', 'respect', 'hispredecessor', 'had', 'imposed', 'members', 'resulting', 'frailedleadership', 'based', 'keeness', 'running', 'family', 'acorporation']",N/A

669916,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00005NRNU,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Boss of Bosses is a little known made for TV movie. Despite the fact that it is a different cast and crew, it was intended as a prequel, to 1996's Gotti, telling the story of Paul Castellano. Castellano was known as the brains behind the mafia's 1980's re-emergence. He believed more in white collar crime, than in organized crime. Castellano was old school and a smart man, the film portrays him as such, but it also tries to play down the fact that he was a criminal who stole millions and hurt a lot of people. Chazz Palminteri was amazing, he was made for roles like this, and shines once again as a hardened, but loveable criminal. As for the film, it's apparently very accurate, and tells you a lot about a private man, that we generally don't hear much about. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The fact that it was made for TV and lacked the nudity and the F bombs, didn't really matter, it was still a very enjoyable film and an excellent companion to Gotti.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,958,"['Boss', 'Bosses', 'little', 'known', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'fact', 'different', 'cast', 'crew', 'was', 'intended', 'prequel', '1996', 'Gotti', 'telling', 'story', 'Paul', 'Castellano', 'Castellano', 'was', 'known', 'brains', 'mafia', '1980', 're-emergence', 'believed', 'more', 'white', 'collar', 'crime', 'organized', 'crime', 'Castellano', 'was', 'old', 'school', 'smart', 'man', 'film', 'such', 'also', 'play', 'down', 'fact', 'was', 'criminal', 'who', 'stole', 'millions', 'hurt', 'lot', 'people', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'was', 'amazing', 'was', 'made', 'roles', 'shines', 'once', 'again', 'hardened', 'loveable', 'criminal', 'film', 'apparently', 'very', 'accurate', 'lot', 'private', 'man', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'hear', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'quite', 'bit', 'fact', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'lacked', 'nudity', 'F', 'bombs', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'excellent', 'companion', 'Gotti']",N/A
669917,A1NLX2NT3A5Z1U,B00005NRNU,TOL,"[40, 43]","I'm a great fan of Chazz Palminteri, which is why I orignally purchased this DVD. And, I have to say, that his acting was, as always, terrific. As a movie, this was enjoyable. The writing was not great and the plot really didn't move you, but, for some reason, the movie was digestable.This plot follows the rise and fall of one-time Gambino family boss Paul Castellano. Obviously, this movie was made to offset the negative press that the late-Castellano has received over the years through the volumes of books, movies, and articles written about John Gotti. In fact, movies like 'Gotti' paint an entirely different picture than this one. So much so that if you watch both movies side-by-side (as I did), you feel as though you are watching two entirely different stories. In reality, the movies cover different time periods. But, those areas that do overlap are told from two entirely different perspectives. Example: The movie 'Gotti' paints Paul Castellano as an overweight, unintelligent, mean-spirited man who had not paid his dues and, consequently, did not deserve his position at all. 'Boss Of Bosses' paints Castellano as a well-spoken, well-groomed, intelligent business man who had risen legitimately through the ranks with his close friend Carlo Gambino.Which version is accurate? I can't say that I know. What I do know is that the 'Gotti' version of Paul Castellano is the one that I had come to believe before I watched this DVD. Now, I'm not sure.Watch this DVD and judge for yourself. If nothing else, you'll be entertained for 90 minutes or so by a fantastic leading actor.",4,A New Perspective,1010793600,"01 12, 2002",2002,1593,"[""'m"", 'great', 'fan', 'Chazz', 'Palminteri', 'why', 'orignally', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'have', 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'always', 'terrific', 'movie', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'writing', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'plot', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'reason', 'movie', 'was', 'digestable.This', 'plot', 'rise', 'fall', 'one-time', 'Gambino', 'family', 'boss', 'Paul', 'Castellano', 'Obviously', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'offset', 'negative', 'press', 'late-Castellano', 'received', 'years', 'volumes', 'books', 'movies', 'articles', 'written', 'John', 'Gotti', 'fact', 'movies', ""'Gotti"", 'paint', 'entirely', 'different', 'picture', 'one', 'So', 'much', 'watch', 'movies', 'side-by-side', 'did', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'two', 'entirely', 'different', 'stories', 'reality', 'movies', 'cover', 'different', 'time', 'periods', 'areas', 'do', 'overlap', 'are', 'told', 'two', 'entirely', 'different', 'perspectives', 'Example', 'movie', 'paints', 'Paul', 'Castellano', 'overweight', 'unintelligent', 'mean-spirited', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'paid', 'dues', 'consequently', 'did', 'not', 'deserve', 'position', ""'Boss"", 'Bosses', 'paints', 'Castellano', 'well-spoken', 'well-groomed', 'intelligent', 'business', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'risen', 'legitimately', 'ranks', 'close', 'friend', 'Carlo', 'Gambino.Which', 'version', 'accurate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'know', 'What', 'do', 'know', ""'Gotti"", 'version', 'Paul', 'Castellano', 'one', 'had', 'come', 'believe', 'watched', 'DVD', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure.Watch', 'DVD', 'judge', 'nothing', 'else', ""'ll"", 'be', 'entertained', '90', 'minutes', 'so', 'fantastic', 'leading', 'actor']",N/A
