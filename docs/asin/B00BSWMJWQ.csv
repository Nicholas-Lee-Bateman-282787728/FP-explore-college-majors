If so, you'll be touched by this documentary and will want to watch it over and over. This story involves the ACC & NCAA tournament run by the North Carolina State Wolfpack men's basketball team from 1983, which culminated in the national championship game against Houston. You'll enjoy the story regarding the March Madness, but even more moving was the story about N.C. State's head coach, Jim Valvano. Valvano had a storied career as a basketball coach, and became an announcer for ESPN/ABC; he suffered from cancer shortly after leaving coaching and this story is about his struggle as well. I would rate this ESPN &#34;30 for 30&#34; as probably the best, and by far the most moving of any of these fantastic films. I highly recommend this film to you, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed when you see it.",5,"Required Viewing, Trust Me",1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,904,"['Are', 'sports', 'fan', 'Do', 'know', 'anyone', 'anyone', 'family', 'died', 'cancer', 'so', ""'ll"", 'be', 'touched', 'documentary', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'story', 'ACC', 'NCAA', 'tournament', 'run', 'North', 'Carolina', 'State', 'Wolfpack', 'men', 'basketball', 'team', '1983', 'culminated', 'national', 'championship', 'game', 'Houston', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'story', 'regarding', 'March', 'Madness', 'even', 'more', 'moving', 'was', 'story', 'N.C.', 'State', 'head', 'coach', 'Jim', 'Valvano', 'Valvano', 'had', 'storied', 'career', 'basketball', 'coach', 'became', 'announcer', 'ESPN/ABC', 'suffered', 'cancer', 'shortly', 'leaving', 'coaching', 'story', 'struggle', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'rate', 'ESPN', '34', '30', '30', '34', 'probably', 'best', 'far', 'most', 'moving', 'fantastic', 'films', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'guarantee', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'when', 'see']",ESPN Films 30 for 30:  Survive and Advance

Yeah, the Valvano scenes during that battle are interspersed with basketball from about 10 years earlier, which is a little confusing; hence, I would have given the movie 4.5 stars if possible, but I'm happy to &#34;round up&#34;.I knew the names of the main NC State players, but little about them as people. (A couple of standouts: Dereck Whittenburg, who also produced the film, is a font of information, and Thurl Bailey is strikingly articulate.) I knew their championship game with Houston went down to the wire, but I'd forgotten the series of comebacks and cliffhangers that NC State had to survive to reach that game!All in all, a rich portrait of tragedy and miracles.",5,"Rich film about a basketball team - but even more, about people and dreams",1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,1016,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'consistently', 'impressed', '34', '30', '30', '34', 'films', '34', 'Survive', 'Advance', '34', 'exception.Lots', 'reminiscences', 'insights', 'players', 'are', 'interspersed', 'fascinating', 'explorations', 'inimitable', 'Jim', 'Valvano', 'unique', 'personality', 'close', 'relations', 'players', 'inspiring', 'battle', 'cancer', 'Yeah', 'Valvano', 'scenes', 'battle', 'are', 'interspersed', 'basketball', '10', 'years', 'earlier', 'little', 'confusing', 'hence', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'movie', '4.5', 'stars', 'possible', ""'m"", 'happy', '34', 'round', 'up', '34', 'knew', 'names', 'main', 'NC', 'State', 'players', 'little', 'about', 'people', 'couple', 'standouts', 'Dereck', 'Whittenburg', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'film', 'font', 'information', 'Thurl', 'Bailey', 'strikingly', 'articulate', 'knew', 'championship', 'game', 'Houston', 'went', 'down', 'wire', ""'d"", 'forgotten', 'series', 'comebacks', 'cliffhangers', 'NC', 'State', 'had', 'survive', 'reach', 'game', 'rich', 'portrait', 'tragedy', 'miracles']",ESPN Films 30 for 30:  Survive and Advance

1638084,A2W8H62ICF3OHJ,B00BSWMJWQ,"T. Hunt ""wasabi crush""","[16, 16]","""Survive and Advance"" is another stunning documentary in the ESPN Films: 30 for 30 series and tells the story of North Carolina State University's 1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball championship title.  Told through the eyes of the players and staff, it's a recollection of wild, improbable success and a homage to one of the finest coaches to ever set foot on the hardwood, Jim Valvano.As a documentary, and this holds true with most of the 30 for 30 projects I've seen, it's masterfully done.  This is important because as any fan of documentaries will tell you, an outstanding director can make any subject matter interesting.  My point here is that sports fan will obviously find value in this film, but it shouldn't be passed over by non sports fans, either.  There's a message here that transcends athletics and it's presented beautifully.For those unaware, Jim Valvano died of cancer in 1993.  ""Survive and Advance"", while certainly based on a basketball championship, shows its real beauty in the requiem given to his passing.  Coach Valvano was a sensational, vivacious man who pulled his team to victory through humor and love.  And it's still written on the faces of these players.  They miss him and their recollections were strong enough to bring me to tears with them on a few occasions.  It was moving.The only problem I had with the film, and it's why I'm sitting at four stars, is that there wasn't much to be said for Lorenzo Charles.  The players had gathered in the first place, I believe, to mourn his 2011 passing.  They toast in his memory and speak briefly of his game-winning dunk, but aside from that and a quick mention of the bus accident that took his life, there wasn't much said.  I could be missing something, but it felt like a void had opened up at the start of the program that was never adequately filled concerning Lorenzo Charles.  For me, it detracted from the doc's value, but it's only my opinion.That being said, I recommend buying this title.  During Valvano's powerful ESPY award speech, he said that every day we should all do three things: laugh, think, and cry.  I can tell you that during these 90-some minutes, I did all three.Thank you for your time.- t",4,Exceptionally made.,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",2013,2206,"['Survive', 'Advance', 'stunning', 'documentary', 'ESPN', 'Films', '30', '30', 'series', 'story', 'North', 'Carolina', 'State', 'University', '1983', 'NCAA', 'Men', 'Division', 'Basketball', 'championship', 'title', 'Told', 'eyes', 'players', 'staff', 'recollection', 'wild', 'improbable', 'success', 'homage', 'one', 'finest', 'coaches', 'ever', 'set', 'foot', 'hardwood', 'Jim', 'Valvano.As', 'documentary', 'true', 'most', '30', '30', 'projects', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'masterfully', 'done', 'important', 'fan', 'documentaries', 'will', 'tell', 'outstanding', 'director', 'can', 'make', 'subject', 'matter', 'interesting', 'point', 'here', 'sports', 'fan', 'will', 'obviously', 'find', 'value', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'passed', 'non', 'sports', 'fans', 'either', 'message', 'here', 'athletics', 'presented', 'unaware', 'Jim', 'Valvano', 'died', 'cancer', '1993', 'Survive', 'Advance', 'certainly', 'based', 'basketball', 'championship', 'real', 'beauty', 'requiem', 'given', 'passing', 'Coach', 'Valvano', 'was', 'sensational', 'vivacious', 'man', 'who', 'pulled', 'team', 'victory', 'humor', 'love', 'still', 'written', 'players', 'miss', 'recollections', 'were', 'strong', 'enough', 'bring', 'tears', 'few', 'occasions', 'was', 'moving.The', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'why', ""'m"", 'sitting', 'four', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'be', 'said', 'Lorenzo', 'Charles', 'players', 'had', 'gathered', 'first', 'place', 'believe', 'mourn', '2011', 'passing', 'toast', 'memory', 'speak', 'briefly', 'game-winning', 'dunk', 'aside', 'quick', 'mention', 'bus', 'accident', 'took', 'life', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'said', 'could', 'be', 'missing', 'something', 'felt', 'void', 'had', 'opened', 'up', 'start', 'program', 'was', 'never', 'adequately', 'filled', 'concerning', 'Lorenzo', 'Charles', 'detracted', 'doc', 'value', 'only', 'being', 'said', 'recommend', 'buying', 'title', 'Valvano', 'powerful', 'ESPY', 'award', 'speech', 'said', 'day', 'should', 'do', 'three', 'things', 'laugh', 'think', 'cry', 'can', 'tell', '90-some', 'minutes', 'did', 'three.Thank', 'time.-', 't']",ESPN Films 30 for 30:  Survive and Advance
