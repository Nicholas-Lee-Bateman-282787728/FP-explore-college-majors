1383688,A1CO7AHNW10RZS,B0042SSO1I,"A. Moss ""arm""","[4, 5]","As I mentioned in a review of Starz Camelot series, I've been an Arthur fan since my teen years.  Now on S3, I yearn to enjoy the Merlin series more than I do.  To me, it just seems like a kids' version of the Arthurian legends, with all the hokey faux Old English incantations, CGI monsters, unrealistic scenery, and teenagers playing the important roles.  Several characters in S1, ep 1, had so much heavy & fake makeup on that I almost threw in the towel right then!  Having Merlin himself be a young servant rather than a bearded wizard and Arthur a self-involved youth with a boorish streak is an original concept--but it amused me that they still felt they had to throw in an old geezer (Gaius) to take the place of the elderly sage that the Merlin character usually fills!  With Guinevere also being a servant in this version, that's two key characters they've ""demoted.""  One thing that really bugs me is the way they've plucked names of significant characters from the legends and applied them randomly--sometimes to characters that get killed off in the course of one scene this series--just to get the names in there, I guess.  As for Morgana, Katie McGrath does a decent job with her descent into wickedness until you compare her with Eva Green in Camelot, and, well, there IS no comparison, although, as with the latter series, she is largely the most interesting character.Uther Pendragon is more involved in his children's lives than in most versions, and I do like the dynamic and the actor who portrays him.  As far as the eps themselves go, I definitely prefer the serious ones over the ""comical"" ones.  The one called ""Changeling"" was embarrassing even to watch!  I don't quite ""get"" the relationship between Merlin and the dragon, or why Merlin let him loose in S2 to wreak havoc on the country.  Maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention.I know this series is wildly popular and has a huge fandom, and that there will be plenty of people who disagree with me, which is fine.  I just wish it was more what I wanted!  As it is, it just doesn't seem fair in the scheme of things that Starz Camelot folded after one season and this one is approaching its fifth!  As it goes on, I find my attention wandering more and more as I watch.  But the great thing about the Arthur legends is that they CAN live in so many forms and variations; I'm likely to keep watching as I do find the series mildly entertaining and I love everything Arthur (except the movie:  ""Excalibur""!), so, ""Merlin,""carry on!",3,Wish I liked it better!,1340323200,"06 22, 2012",2012,2513,"['mentioned', 'review', 'Starz', 'Camelot', 'series', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Arthur', 'fan', 'teen', 'years', 'Now', 'S3', 'yearn', 'enjoy', 'Merlin', 'series', 'more', 'do', 'just', 'kids', 'version', 'Arthurian', 'legends', 'hokey', 'faux', 'Old', 'English', 'incantations', 'CGI', 'monsters', 'unrealistic', 'scenery', 'teenagers', 'playing', 'important', 'roles', 'Several', 'characters', 'S1', 'ep', '1', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'heavy', 'fake', 'makeup', 'almost', 'threw', 'towel', 'right', 'then', 'Having', 'Merlin', 'be', 'young', 'servant', 'rather', 'bearded', 'wizard', 'Arthur', 'self-involved', 'youth', 'boorish', 'streak', 'original', 'concept', 'amused', 'still', 'felt', 'had', 'throw', 'old', 'geezer', 'Gaius', 'take', 'place', 'elderly', 'sage', 'Merlin', 'character', 'usually', 'Guinevere', 'also', 'being', 'servant', 'version', 'two', 'key', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'demoted', 'One', 'thing', 'really', 'bugs', 'way', ""'ve"", 'plucked', 'names', 'significant', 'characters', 'legends', 'applied', 'randomly', 'sometimes', 'characters', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'course', 'one', 'scene', 'series', 'just', 'get', 'names', 'there', 'guess', 'Morgana', 'Katie', 'McGrath', 'decent', 'job', 'descent', 'wickedness', 'compare', 'Eva', 'Green', 'Camelot', 'well', 'comparison', 'latter', 'series', 'largely', 'most', 'interesting', 'character.Uther', 'Pendragon', 'more', 'involved', 'children', 'lives', 'most', 'versions', 'do', 'dynamic', 'actor', 'who', 'As', 'far', 'eps', 'go', 'definitely', 'prefer', 'serious', 'ones', 'comical', 'ones', 'one', 'called', 'Changeling', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'even', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'relationship', 'Merlin', 'dragon', 'why', 'Merlin', 'let', 'loose', 'S2', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'country', 'Maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'paying', 'close', 'enough', 'attention.I', 'know', 'series', 'wildly', 'popular', 'huge', 'fandom', 'will', 'be', 'plenty', 'people', 'who', 'disagree', 'fine', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'what', 'wanted', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fair', 'scheme', 'things', 'Starz', 'Camelot', 'folded', 'one', 'season', 'one', 'approaching', 'fifth', 'find', 'attention', 'wandering', 'more', 'more', 'watch', 'great', 'thing', 'Arthur', 'CAN', 'live', 'so', 'many', 'forms', 'variations', ""'m"", 'likely', 'keep', 'watching', 'do', 'find', 'series', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'love', 'everything', 'Arthur', 'movie', 'Excalibur', 'so', 'Merlin', 'carry']",Merlin: The Complete Series 3 2010  Region 2

1383697,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0042SSO1I,Enjolras,"[1, 2]","Merlin seems like an attempt to build off the success of Harry Potter - a TV show about teenage wizards and princes. The series is loosely based on the legend of King Arthur and Merlin in Camelot. I say loosely because it is essentially about the adventures of young Arthur and Merlin. Each episode, the two get into trouble, very much like the early Harry Potter books. However, this show has a lot more spirit than the over-produced Harry Potter movies.What I really appreciate about the show is its maturity, despite its focus on younger characters. The humor is (generally) not slapstick humor, but rather in emphasizing the absurdity of the situations Arthur and Merlin find themselves in. The show gets dark at times and doesn't shy away from death, but also keeps it in good taste - unlike HBO's Game of Thrones, which seems to delight in bloodshed.Merlin also develops its characters, something very hard to do on a TV show. Most TV shows tend to focus on the ""threat of the week"" and rush over character development. It's not uncommon for the characters to remain the same throughout. However, Merlin's characters do have their respective journeys. Arthur in particular goes from callous knight to mature ruler with a sense of responsibility. The show also treats the other characters subtly with few heroes and villains. I especially appreciate how Uther Pendragon is never portrayed as simply a villain, but rather a king with heavy emotional and political burdens to bear.Moreover, Merlin stays true to the atmosphere of the Middle-Ages, with a few obvious deviations. I'm not a historian, but do read a lot of history and there isn't too much I've noticed wrong with the historical details of the era. Although given that it's based on the fictional kingdom of Camelot some liberties are expected. Given that this is a TV show, I'm actually quite impressed with the attention to detail in the sets and clothing.Overall, if you like Harry Potter, definitely check this show out.",5,Like Harry Potter - but better,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,1990,"['Merlin', 'attempt', 'build', 'off', 'success', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'TV', 'show', 'teenage', 'wizards', 'princes', 'series', 'loosely', 'based', 'legend', 'King', 'Arthur', 'Merlin', 'Camelot', 'say', 'loosely', 'essentially', 'adventures', 'young', 'Arthur', 'Merlin', 'episode', 'two', 'get', 'trouble', 'very', 'much', 'early', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'However', 'show', 'lot', 'more', 'spirit', 'over-produced', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies.What', 'really', 'appreciate', 'show', 'maturity', 'focus', 'younger', 'characters', 'humor', 'generally', 'not', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'rather', 'emphasizing', 'absurdity', 'situations', 'Arthur', 'Merlin', 'find', 'show', 'dark', 'times', ""n't"", 'shy', 'away', 'death', 'also', 'good', 'taste', 'HBO', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'delight', 'bloodshed.Merlin', 'also', 'characters', 'something', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'TV', 'show', 'Most', 'TV', 'shows', 'tend', 'focus', 'threat', 'week', 'rush', 'over', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'uncommon', 'characters', 'remain', 'same', 'However', 'Merlin', 'characters', 'do', 'have', 'respective', 'journeys', 'Arthur', 'particular', 'callous', 'knight', 'mature', 'ruler', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'show', 'also', 'other', 'characters', 'subtly', 'few', 'heroes', 'villains', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'how', 'Uther', 'Pendragon', 'never', 'portrayed', 'simply', 'villain', 'rather', 'king', 'heavy', 'emotional', 'political', 'burdens', 'bear.Moreover', 'Merlin', 'true', 'atmosphere', 'Middle-Ages', 'few', 'obvious', 'deviations', ""'m"", 'not', 'historian', 'do', 'read', 'lot', 'history', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'wrong', 'historical', 'details', 'era', 'given', 'based', 'fictional', 'kingdom', 'Camelot', 'liberties', 'are', 'expected', 'Given', 'TV', 'show', ""'m"", 'actually', 'quite', 'impressed', 'attention', 'detail', 'sets', 'clothing.Overall', 'like', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'definitely', 'check', 'show', 'out']",Merlin: The Complete Series 3 2010  Region 2

One of the things that I have always loved about this show is that it is entertaining for all ages, and is a great show to watch with family and friends.This season is stock full of interesting twists and turns while still keeping it light and playful. We see Arthur and Gwen's relationship blossom into a more realistic and heartwarming love. We get to see Merlin and Arthur have even more bro-mance moments. We still get those heart-touching moments between Gaius and Merlin. We meet some great new characters that provide comic relief as well as interesting new plot twists. We even get some great laughs (the episode with the goblin is hilarious...). We also see a much darker side to Camelot, which is the continual thread throughout the season. My only qualm with this series is Morgana's portrayal - my friend and I counted the evil smirks throughout the season and there are just too many of them. The series begins and ends with some of the best episodes, and it's definitely a show that is continuing to grow and blossom - and I can't wait to see what's in store for the rest of Season 4 as well as the bonus features that will be on the DVD!This is definitely a show you want to check out with your family and friends.

1383728,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0042SSO1I,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[28, 32]","For those not in the know, the BBC's ""Merlin"" is to Arthurian legend whatSmallvilleis to the Superman mythos: a long-running prequel that explores the lives of various individuals before they become the renowned figures of legend. In this case, ""Merlin"" is based on the evolution of its four main characters: Merlin (Colin Morgan) as he grows from inexperienced youth to wise mentor, Arthur (Bradley James), who progresses from prattish prince to noble king, Morgana (Katie McGrath), whose fall into darkness provides the show's most tragic arc, and Guinevere (Angel Coulby), a young servant girl who will one day be Queen of Camelot.Rounding out the cast is Anthony Head as King Uther, an uncompromising ruler whose persecution of magic provides the main conflict of the show (for Merlin must keep his innate powers a secret at all costs) and Richard Wilson as Gaius the court physician, who lends support and advice to Merlin. It is these characters and the range of complex relationships they share, whether familial, romantic or antagonistic, that make the show so appealing. The entire cast is immensely talented, share amazing chemistry with one another, and are backed up by reoccurring guest-stars as other familiar characters from legend: Emilia Fox as Morgause, Santiago Cabrera as Lancelot, and John Hurt as the voice of the Great Dragon. With beautiful visuals and surprisingly good special effects, ""Merlin"" is suited for a family audience. There's nothing here that's too traumatizing for young viewers, though it does get darker as the series goes on.SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW. Nothing too drastic, more character-related than plot-related, and most of it pertaining to the first two episodes.***The third series picks up a year after the season two finale, during which the main cast has been diligently searching the kingdom for Morgana. Spirited away at the end ofseries twoby her half-sister Morgause, only Merlin knows the true reason for her disappearance and his culpability in it (it's a bit of a long story, and obviously you'll want to watch the first two series before jumping headfirst into the third one). Arthur and Merlin are searching for her in enemy territory when a familiar figure stumbles out of the mist: Morgana! She is whisked back to Camelot, much to the joy of her foster-father Uther, but Merlin is not so sure she can be trusted. As an army marches upon Camelot at the behest of Morgause, it becomes apparent that there is a traitor within the walls of Camelot, a discovery that sets up the arc of the entire season.With thirteen episodes in all, season three of ""Merlin"" is a bit of a mixed bag - mostly good, but with a few missed opportunities that prevent it from being truly exceptional entertainment. But first, the good stuff. The series opener and finale (""The Tears of Uther Pendragon"" and ""The Coming of Arthur"") are both two-parters, and are the best that the show has ever been. These four episodes are filmic in terms of the storytelling, visual effects and emotional punch on display. We get our clearest glimpse yet of the future that it to come, what with the reappearance of Excalibur and the Lady of the Lake, the introduction of the Round Table Knights, and that glorious final shot of...well, I'd better not give it away. It's wonderful, stirring stuff.Between our four young actors a great dynamic is at work. Arthur and Guinevere's love story begins to develop from puppy love into something more serious, and if you thought that the pairing was a little rushed in the second series, give it another chance. Here the writers allow the couple to flirt and laugh and enjoy each other's company, and as a result Bradley and Angel's chemistry feels much more natural. Meanwhile, Colin and Katie channel a very different kind of chemistry as former-friends Merlin and Morgana draw their line in the sand and find themselves on opposite sides. Their scenes together are nothing short of electrifying as Morgana strives to bring down the Pendragons and Merlin attempts to oppose her at every turn whilst protecting his own secret.Among the new characters that are introduced this season are the future Knights of the Round Table, providing heroics and eye-candy in equal measure. There are also some great episodes such as ""The Crystal Cave"" and ""The Eye of the Phoenix"" which do a great job of melding elements of Arthurian legend with the show's own vision.But...there's a downside. To my mind at least, there are two major problems at work in season three that prevent it from getting a five-star rating.The biggest disappointment of season three is what was meant to be its trump-card: Morgana. A prequel's success lies in the journey that characters take to predetermined destinations. We all KNOW where Merlin, Morgana, Arthur and Guinevere end up. What we're interested in is HOW they get to those places, and Morgana's fall from a spoilt but essentially good-hearted young woman to the evil enchantress of legend undoubtedly held the most potential for a dramatic character-arc.Morgana had been established as a brave, impulsive, passionate woman who was frightened by her growing powers and terrified of Uther's hatred of magic despite his love for her. We had seen for ourselves how dangerous she could be when crossed and how gifted she was with the art of manipulation. Hers was a personality that could quite easily be corrupted by fear and hatred, whilst still remaining sympathetic and defensible given her circumstances - after all, Morgana's main goal is to destroy a genocidal tyrant. For any writer, this set-up would be considered pure gold.And so it is a bitter disappointment to discover that the Morgana who returns to Camelot is not a dangerous and intelligent adversary with justifiable goals, divided loyalties and complex motivation, but rather nothing more than a petty caricature of evil. Her plans are illogical and convoluted, and thus fail without exception. She turns on Arthur and Guinevere without hesitation or remorse, taking sadistic pleasure in tormenting them for no apparent reason. There is a perpetual smirk on her face that nobody ever seems to notice. Despite the terrifying prospect of a traitor within the walls of Camelot, she poses no viable threat whatsoever and is continually thwarted by Merlin with almost laughable ease.Katie McGrath plays the part with relish, but for reasons best known to them, the writers took their most fascinating character and turned her into their most one-dimensional, void of any kind of sympathy, reason, or consistency. Not only has Morgana's past nuance been obliterated, but the events that could have explained this shift in personality took place entirely OFF SCREEN in the missing year between series two and three. It's a baffling creative decision, especially when one considers how fascinating her character-arc could have been.The other big disappointment of season three is the writer's steadfast refusal to move their plots forward. Much of the season is simply filler, and the stalling tactics are enough to wear the patience of any viewer. Every time there seems to be some sort of forward momentum in the story-arc, the writers veer off into irrelevant side-plots, skipping over what could have been fascinating material in favor of comedic farce, recycled plotlines, and one-shot guest stars. This has the added consequence of making the characters seem remarkably stupid, as they fail to follow up on leads or to ask questions that would have pushed the stories forward into new and interesting territory. For instance, it's ridiculous that neither Morgana nor Morgause think to question the fact that Merlin was able to escape the magical chains that they bind him with; or that Arthur and Uther wouldn't try to discover the identity of the traitor after the magical sabotage during the siege on Camelot.Why don't they do these things? Simply because if they did, the writers would be forced to move the story forward into places they (for whatever reason) don't want to go yet. Unfortunately it really achieves nothing except to make their characters seem dense, and waste a lot of good material.  Other times ideas are raised only to be ignored - there was a chance to explore Gwen's character further what with the introduction of her brother and her discovery of Morgana's magic, but nothing ever comes of these plot-points.The status-quo is finally shaken up at the end of the series, but by exorcising all the filler throughout the series, the events of ""The Coming of Arthur"" could have easily been stretched out over five or so episodes. We could have seen more of Morgana's reign, more of Gwen in the role of a spy, more of Uther's suffering, more of Arthur living rough in the woods, gathering his allies, and planning a counter-attack to win back his kingdom, more of Merlin and the future knights training and getting to know one another and working as a team to create La Resistance - you know, all the *interesting* stuff that inexplicably happens off-screen.Am I being too harsh? Maybe. ""Merlin"" has never pretended to be anything but fun and frivolous family entertainment, and in that it does the job. But so often it misses out on being something very brave and different, held back by the writers' (or producers') reluctance to give up the pointless standalone episodes in favor of a larger, more complex arc in which their characters can behave logically and develop naturally. With season four due to start very soon, I'm hoping that the show is finally ready to grow up and realize its potential.",4,"""She is the Darkness to Your Light...""",1316649600,"09 22,

The writing, acting,and directing are very good, and the plots for the third season are more exciting. The characters are becoming more caught up in the intrigue of the Arthurian legend. Merlin and Arthur are on the path that will lead to the fulfillment of their destinies. The growing maturity of both characters is a delight and the strong friendship that they have developed now adds to the great plot twists in every episode.

1383732,A1M0OSCFOAMAZO,B0042SSO1I,taaj,"[1, 1]","I liked seasons 1 & 2 because I am interested in the Merlin/Arthur tales, but I wasn't sold on them because they were definitely NOT in the style of the Once and Future King. Lots of things were changed without good reason and without improving upon the story. A year has passed since I saw those. I have also been to a couple of the spots where they did some filming for season 3 (Ragland Castle & Puzzlewood). I think both of those things helped to prepare me to appreciate season 3 more... and I did.In the second season, I felt like the writers were playing up the teen idol, sex appeal, bad as* quality of the characters. As a mature person, I didn't see any of them in that light, so that was a complete turn off. This season has more of a grown up, serious, and even dark at times, feel to it. I like that.I didn't like Bradley James (Arthur) at first, but I find that he's the perfect actor to play this character as he's now being written. His expressions and actions feel genuine. However, I am glad that he has less screen time and Merlin isn't just being shown through his interactions with Arthur.Katie McGrath (Morgana) is the weak link. I think the writers have made her flat and uninteresting... or at least that is how she's being played. She has the same dumb smirk on throughout season 3. You really have to suspend reality to believe that nobody is on to her switch in loyalties.Guinevere doesn't have much to do. That's fine with me. She's not that interesting either. The chemistry between her and Arthur is nonexistent.Colin Morgan (Merlin) has come into his own. His part is richer and his acting is better. You can see the maturity in his character. He is becoming more willful and wise. It makes for a much more interesting story. And since the series is called MERLIN, what could be more appropriate?So, it's still not the Once and Future King, but it's a fun filled fantasy that all ages can enjoy. It's got magic, dragons, wizards, legends, and good triumphing over evil.
