The Loss of Sexual Innocence is a meditative, impressionistic, mostly dialogue-less, deeply beautiful and aggressively non-linear exploration of various forms of innocence lost--or shattered. The chopped-up plot structure at first is confusing, but as the threads start to come together the parrallels drawn and metaphors presented are provocative. A film that makes its audience really think ought to be appreciated in our age of brainless blockbusters. Though it is best to keep in mind that there is no solid main point, no overall meaning you're meant to find in the film. In the end it is more like a piece of music than a story: weaving themes in and out, leaving the audience to form their own opinions and interpretations. While it doesn't succeed with flying colors, it is certainly worthwhile and interesting, and stunningly gorgeous to boot.",4,paradise lost,986342400,"04 4, 2001",2001,883,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'admire', 'ambition', 'Loss', 'Sexual', 'Innocence', 'meditative', 'impressionistic', 'mostly', 'dialogue-less', 'deeply', 'beautiful', 'aggressively', 'non-linear', 'exploration', 'various', 'forms', 'innocence', 'lost', 'shattered', 'chopped-up', 'plot', 'structure', 'first', 'confusing', 'threads', 'start', 'come', 'together', 'parrallels', 'drawn', 'metaphors', 'presented', 'are', 'provocative', 'film', 'audience', 'really', 'think', 'ought', 'be', 'appreciated', 'age', 'brainless', 'blockbusters', 'best', 'keep', 'mind', 'solid', 'main', 'point', 'overall', 'meaning', ""'re"", 'meant', 'find', 'film', 'end', 'more', 'piece', 'music', 'story', 'weaving', 'themes', 'leaving', 'audience', 'form', 'own', 'opinions', 'interpretations', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'flying', 'colors', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', 'interesting', 'stunningly', 'gorgeous', 'boot']",N/A

THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE is profoundly effective through its  ability to not tell the story of an emotion or emotions, but (through  non-linear structure, visual narrative and improvisation over meaning-laden  dialogue, and provocative retelling of religious myth as a thread of  symbolism) to actually put emotion on film.  You see and feel  jealousy,  guilt, shame, passion, epiphany, rage, desire, despair, total confusion,  and every other emotion that makes up the experience of the loss of sexual  innocence.  There are scenes that seem not to work as well as others.  Yet  even in saying that, the impulse is to critique them in the context of the  linear films we are used to seeing out of Hollywood, when that isn't the  kind of film the director actually made.

It's visually impressive, but then so are most  perfume commercials, and this has about as much depth as a perfume  commercial. Playing like an overly (to put it mildly) ambitious installment  of Red Shoe Diaries, The Loss of Sexual Innocence is actually painful to  behold. Its woefully misguided premise that sexuality is the be all, end  all of who we are is laughable and vaguely offensive. The performances are  hollow and superficial. The pseudo-Camus ending is terrible, and the fact  that the film's longest stretch of dialogue comes when the over priviliged  characters begin to talk, directly to the camera, about the plight of the  third world was enough to make me want to demand repayment of the money I  didn't spend on this mess.

21454,A34D06JL7LC6MU,0767837371,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[3, 3]","I've never seen a movie by Mike Figgis (although I just rented ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and will watch it later) and I don't know what drew me to see this movie, but Figgis has a very interesting vision. The movie somehow stretches 103 minutes with little events or dialouge occuring. However, I barely noticed the lack of dialouge until much later in the film. The unique thing is events do occur when there is no dialouge. The movie does have a plot that unfolds very quickly and it has some of the strangest plot points I've ever seen. No synopsis could accurately describe what this movie is about or what it's going to look like, but I'll try. The movie begins in Kenya, where we meet a young boy named Nic who watches a young Kenyan girl read to an old man from The Bible in nothing but lingerie. Then, years later, Nic is with his girlfriend (who's name I don't recall) who's father has just died. She ignores him and he catches her necking with some guy in her room. Then, we go back and watch as they attempt to have sex on the floor but are caught by her father who doesn't even notice what they were trying to do. Then, we meet Nic years later. Nic is married and has a young son and his marriage is obviously (although we are never told this directly) in turmoil. But, that's OK because Nic has a mistress who also happens to work with him. He's a film producer and he's traveling to some other country to shoot a movie. During all this, we are shown short vignettes of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, discovering new things. The entire story (with no dialouge whatsoever) is told here. The snake, the fruit. Except they're thrown out by a bunch of cops and barking dogs. Odd. Some of these scenes are very explicit too (especially the ones where both of them urinate), I'm amazed they got away with only an R rating. But, as I've mentioned; there's a huge lack of dialouge.This would be unbearable if it weren't for the score. The music in this film is absolutely amazing (and composed by Figgis, talented guy) and I'm surprised it didn't get Oscar nominated. I do agree with a lot of the reviews on this site, but this movie is pretty affecting in some parts which really does show talent if you're capable of having an affect on someone with out saying anything. The Adam & Eve section could be deleted from the film and they would not have to edit out a single other scene and the movie would still be good. But the movie's heart & soul really is these scenes. They're beautiful, if not a bit creepy. But, this is a strange movie that is not something you need to add to your DVD collection and it's not a movie you'd probably watch again. But the first time you watch it, it's a strange/weird/creepy experience.I do recommend it, but rent it before buying.GRADE: A-",5,"Very Odd, Slightly Innovative",1145404800,"04 19, 2006",2006,2781,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'Mike', 'Figgis', 'just', 'rented', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'will', 'watch', 'later', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'drew', 'see', 'movie', 'Figgis', 'very', 'interesting', 'vision', 'movie', 'somehow', '103', 'minutes', 'little', 'events', 'dialouge', 'occuring', 'However', 'barely', 'noticed', 'lack', 'dialouge', 'much', 'later', 'film', 'unique', 'thing', 'events', 'do', 'occur', 'when', 'dialouge', 'movie', 'have', 'plot', 'very', 'quickly', 'strangest', 'plot', 'points', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'synopsis', 'could', 'accurately', 'describe', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'what', 'going', 'look', ""'ll"", 'try', 'movie', 'Kenya', 'where', 'meet', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Nic', 'who', 'young', 'Kenyan', 'girl', 'read', 'old', 'man', 'Bible', 'nothing', 'lingerie', 'Then', 'years', 'later', 'Nic', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'name', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'who', 'father', 'just', 'died', 'necking', 'guy', 'room', 'Then', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'attempt', 'have', 'sex', 'floor', 'are', 'caught', 'father', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'what', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'Then', 'meet', 'Nic', 'years', 'later', 'Nic', 'married', 'young', 'son', 'marriage', 'obviously', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'directly', 'turmoil', 'OK', 'Nic', 'mistress', 'who', 'also', 'work', 'film', 'producer', 'traveling', 'other', 'country', 'shoot', 'movie', 'are', 'shown', 'short', 'vignettes', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'discovering', 'new', 'things', 'entire', 'story', 'dialouge', 'whatsoever', 'told', 'here', 'snake', 'fruit', ""'re"", 'thrown', 'out', 'bunch', 'cops', 'barking', 'dogs', 'Odd', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'explicit', 'too', 'especially', 'ones', 'where', 'urinate', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'got', 'away', 'only', 'R', 'rating', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'huge', 'lack', 'dialouge.This', 'would', 'be', 'unbearable', 'were', ""n't"", 'score', 'music', 'film', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'composed', 'Figgis', 'talented', 'guy', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'do', 'agree', 'lot', 'reviews', 'site', 'movie', 'pretty', 'affecting', 'parts', 'really', 'show', 'talent', ""'re"", 'capable', 'having', 'affect', 'someone', 'out', 'saying', 'anything', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'section', 'could', 'be', 'deleted', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'edit', 'out', 'single', 'other', 'scene', 'movie', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'heart', 'soul', 'really', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'beautiful', 'not', 'bit', 'creepy', 'strange', 'movie', 'not', 'something', 'need', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection', 'not', 'movie', ""'d"", 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'watch', 'strange/weird/creepy', 'experience.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'rent', 'buying.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

Throughout the film, they begin to discover their differences and sexual awaking. The other characters are shown as they learn about sexuality through circumstance. Saffron Burrows plays both parts of a pair of twins who, though never explained,, obviously were raised apart without knowing they each have twin. In the best scene of the film, one of the twins arrives at an airport. The other is waiting there to meet a man who was on the same plane.Finally through the chaos at the arrival gates, they lock eyes on each other and each holds a mesmerizing stare of the other. A random accident causes them to lose focus, and each meets the person they were awaiting. This chance meeting is never dwelled on after that. Saffrons main twin is a part of film crew on a film project. In an accident that takes the life of a native boy, Her character volunteers to stay behind with the natives after the accident. The natives promptly pull out knives and stab her to death.This is almost a reoccurring theme in most of the Saffron Burrows films I have seen. She reaches out to manifest some truth, and is eventually smitten by this endeavor . So Saffron gets lost/destroyed. Her Twin will never know what became of her.

Lots of apparently disconnected scenes, scrambled in  time, evolving at a glacial pace towards a pseudo-profound conclusion.  Finally, and thankfully, the various strands are gathered together to make  a few trite and adolescent points. Dreadful stuff. When I was 15 years old  (in the 1970s) I would have regarded this movie with awe. Now, I simply  wonder why a fine director would make such a silly and self-indulgent film  so far into his career. Mr Figgis, please return to making movies for  adults.
