It was produced by a local PBS station in Pennsylvania and the amateurish and dull presentation was surprising due to Stacey Keach's involvement.I was interested in viewing this because of Pulitzer Prize winner Bruce Catton's involvement.  Sadly, Catton did not really come across particularly well (he was, after all, quite elderly in the footage shown); nor did he make comments beyond the most superficial regarding this quintessential American battle.",1,Ultra Low Budget - less than half an hour long,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,560,"['watched', 'last', 'night', 'much', 'dismay', 'entire', 'show', 'lasted', 'slightly', 'less', 'hour', 'was', 'produced', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'Pennsylvania', 'amateurish', 'dull', 'presentation', 'was', 'surprising', 'due', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'involvement.I', 'was', 'interested', 'viewing', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winner', 'Bruce', 'Catton', 'involvement', 'Sadly', 'Catton', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'come', 'particularly', 'well', 'was', 'quite', 'elderly', 'footage', 'shown', 'did', 'make', 'comments', 'most', 'superficial', 'regarding', 'quintessential', 'American', 'battle']",Last Full Measure VHS

719233,A1LGDLGQXO4XO0,B00006JU9I,Jackie Morton,"[0, 0]","I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that the Military History Collection features hundreds of hard-to-find military history programs and an extensive collection of aviation military history past, present and future. Our library includes the largest resource of Army, Navy, Marine and Airforce programs from WW I, WW II, the Korean Conflict and the Vietnam War to flying instruction and modern aircraft. Focused on the period spanning WWI through the Vietnam Era on land, sea and air, they provide an overview of America's leadership role as a fighting nation and its interaction with enemies and allies. From Great War Battles and the fighting Warbirds of WWII to helicopter action, Vietnam and NASA space programs, these titles will enthrall both history buffs and students of the period. What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people.",5,Last Full Measure,1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,945,"['choose', 'rating', 'movie', 'good', 'What', 'like', 'movie', 'Military', 'History', 'Collection', 'hundreds', 'hard-to-find', 'military', 'history', 'programs', 'extensive', 'collection', 'aviation', 'military', 'history', 'present', 'future', 'library', 'largest', 'resource', 'Army', 'Navy', 'Marine', 'Airforce', 'programs', 'WW', 'WW', 'II', 'Korean', 'Conflict', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'flying', 'instruction', 'modern', 'aircraft', 'Focused', 'period', 'spanning', 'WWI', 'Vietnam', 'Era', 'land', 'sea', 'air', 'provide', 'overview', 'America', 'leadership', 'role', 'fighting', 'nation', 'interaction', 'enemies', 'allies', 'Great', 'War', 'Battles', 'fighting', 'Warbirds', 'WWII', 'helicopter', 'action', 'Vietnam', 'NASA', 'space', 'programs', 'titles', 'will', 'enthrall', 'history', 'buffs', 'students', 'period', 'What', 'dislike', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'other', 'people']",Last Full Measure VHS

I say this, because I dont think that the real film has been released yet. Taking this into account, I am perplexed about what the two previous revews were exactly reviewing about.  This is a mystery worth solving.  In the meantime watch Gods and Generals, as well as Gettysburg; both are outstanding films----and dont give up hope for the real conclusion in The Last full Measure. This is not &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot; (what I, and my fellow reviwers are appearently reviewing)......The, &quot;the&quot; is missing-----see what I mean; this movie is just &quot;Last Full Measure&quot;.  Lastly, I provided this film III stars, because Im not sure what it is about, all I know, is that it is not &quot;The Last Full Measure&quot; we all seek.  I hope I havnt confused you even more than you were before you read this review......yeah.

I loved learning about General Grant becausehe was such an awesome man.  I admire him for his honesty, humility, and just plain common sense.  I was shocked to read thathe allowed such corruption and greed from his subordinates when he was President.  Shaara said it was because he was so used to everyonedoing what he/she said they would do.
