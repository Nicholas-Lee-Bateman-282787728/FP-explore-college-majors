1064564,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B000OIOPLS,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[1, 1]","I've never heard of The Nurse before watching it tonight, in which it has a similar feel toThe Hand That Rocks the Cradle. The movie stars Lisa Zane (Billy Zane's older sister) as Laura Harriman, a nurse who wants revenge!Her father had recently murdered her mother and brother. Then he took his own life, all because he was accused of embezzling money. Bob Martin is the man who turned him over to the police and after hearing about the deaths, he has a stroke which leaves him paralyzed.Laura wants revenge for her family's deaths, so she kills Bob's live-in-nurse and she becomes his new nurse. Since he is paralyzed, he can't inform his wife or children about who the nurse really is. One by one, Laura plans on killing each family member while Bob watches helplessly.The movie was released to direct-to-video (aka VHS) in the late 90s and thanks for Echo Bridge Home Entertainment for releasing it to DVD, I bought the movie in an eight movie bundle. I didn't know what to expect when I saw Lisa Zane's name in the opening credits as I never cared for her inFreddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, but she gave a good performance as a psycho nurse. The movie is less horror and more like a made-for-TV thriller, except it has a few f-bombs in it. The Nurse isn't really scary, but I was entertained for 90 minutes!",3,Don't Let the Nurse Inside Your House!,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,1315,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Nurse', 'watching', 'tonight', 'similar', 'feel', 'toThe', 'Hand', 'Cradle', 'movie', 'Lisa', 'Zane', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'older', 'sister', 'Laura', 'Harriman', 'nurse', 'who', 'revenge', 'father', 'had', 'recently', 'murdered', 'mother', 'brother', 'Then', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'was', 'accused', 'embezzling', 'money', 'Bob', 'Martin', 'man', 'who', 'turned', 'police', 'hearing', 'deaths', 'stroke', 'paralyzed.Laura', 'revenge', 'family', 'deaths', 'Bob', 'live-in-nurse', 'new', 'nurse', 'paralyzed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'inform', 'wife', 'children', 'who', 'nurse', 'really', 'One', 'one', 'Laura', 'killing', 'family', 'member', 'Bob', 'helplessly.The', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'direct-to-video', 'aka', 'VHS', 'late', '90s', 'thanks', 'Echo', 'Bridge', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'releasing', 'DVD', 'bought', 'movie', 'eight', 'movie', 'bundle', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'saw', 'Lisa', 'Zane', 'name', 'opening', 'credits', 'never', 'cared', 'inFreddy', 'Dead', 'Final', 'Nightmare', 'gave', 'good', 'performance', 'psycho', 'nurse', 'movie', 'less', 'horror', 'more', 'made-for-TV', 'thriller', 'few', 'f-bombs', 'Nurse', ""n't"", 'really', 'scary', 'was', 'entertained', '90', 'minutes']",The Nurse

The subject matter, and the thought that something like that could actually happen, might be a bit unnerving to someone who's had previous issues with any type of home care or may be facing issues with home care.  If so, I don't think I'd recommend they watch this.

1064568,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B000OIOPLS,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","This film reminded of ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle."" George Harriman (Lou Felder) a poorly developed character has been terminated from his fictional movie company for embezzling and to top it all off he might go to prison. Like any white collar criminal faced with ""hard"" time in a federal pen, he opts to do the honorable thing and shoot his family and himself...except for some reason he omits his daughter who is a nurse (Lisa Zane as Laura Harriman ).When George's former boss Bob (Michael Fairman) hears about it he goes catatonic, like Ned seeing the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka (South Park season 2). Laura assumes a new identity to infiltrate the home as a nurse so she can bump off Bob's family in front of him.The terror and acting were both lame. Except for the rare F-bomb, this could have been a made for TV movie. Perhaps my biggest disappointment was right after I obtained this film I discovered it was available in a multi-film pack for the same price.Rare F-bomb, no sex or nudity. What this movie really needed was for Demi Moore to play the lead with a token shower scene and a little more success and creativity in killing off relatives.",2,THE HAND THAT MOCKS THE CRADLE,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,1177,"['film', 'reminded', 'Hand', 'Cradle', 'George', 'Harriman', 'Lou', 'Felder', 'poorly', 'developed', 'character', 'been', 'terminated', 'fictional', 'movie', 'company', 'embezzling', 'top', 'might', 'go', 'prison', 'white', 'collar', 'criminal', 'faced', 'hard', 'time', 'federal', 'pen', 'do', 'honorable', 'thing', 'shoot', 'family', 'reason', 'daughter', 'who', 'nurse', 'Lisa', 'Zane', 'Laura', 'Harriman', '.When', 'George', 'former', 'boss', 'Bob', 'Michael', 'Fairman', 'catatonic', 'Ned', 'seeing', 'Mexican', 'Staring', 'Frog', 'Southern', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'South', 'Park', 'season', '2', 'Laura', 'new', 'identity', 'infiltrate', 'home', 'nurse', 'can', 'bump', 'off', 'Bob', 'family', 'front', 'him.The', 'terror', 'acting', 'were', 'lame', 'rare', 'F-bomb', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'was', 'right', 'obtained', 'film', 'discovered', 'was', 'available', 'multi-film', 'pack', 'same', 'price.Rare', 'F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', 'What', 'movie', 'really', 'needed', 'was', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'play', 'lead', 'token', 'shower', 'scene', 'little', 'more', 'success', 'creativity', 'killing', 'off', 'relatives']",The Nurse
1064569,AF6MWBGDVB39Y,B000OIOPLS,The Whatever Dude,"[4, 5]","Third movie in the boxset. I've always wanted to see this for some time after seeing a Pay-Per-View promo. I've also been a fan of actress Lisa Zane for some time.The movie centers around a nurse named Laura Harriman who becomes traumatized after seeing her father kill himself over an embezzlement scandel, after he kills his own family, except for Laura. She then becomes bent on getting even with stroke victim Bob Martin (Played by Michael Fairman from Dead Silence) who is parylzed and at the same time mute. She gets a chance to do so when she gets a job as his private nurse.  Laura gets her revenge by killing members of the Martin family one by one.I don't really wanna give too much away, especially since the hurricane's approaching. I'll end this review by saying if you can find this movie, get it. The DVD quality's pretty good too.",4,Pretty cool movie.,1221177600,"09 12, 2008",2008,846,"['Third', 'movie', 'boxset', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'see', 'time', 'seeing', 'Pay-Per-View', 'promo', ""'ve"", 'also', 'been', 'fan', 'actress', 'Lisa', 'Zane', 'time.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'nurse', 'named', 'Laura', 'Harriman', 'who', 'traumatized', 'seeing', 'father', 'kill', 'embezzlement', 'scandel', 'own', 'family', 'Laura', 'then', 'bent', 'getting', 'even', 'stroke', 'victim', 'Bob', 'Martin', 'Played', 'Michael', 'Fairman', 'Dead', 'Silence', 'who', 'parylzed', 'same', 'time', 'mute', 'chance', 'do', 'so', 'when', 'job', 'private', 'nurse', 'Laura', 'revenge', 'killing', 'members', 'Martin', 'family', 'one', 'one.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'wan', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'especially', 'hurricane', 'approaching', ""'ll"", 'end', 'review', 'saying', 'can', 'find', 'movie', 'get', 'DVD', 'quality', 'pretty', 'good', 'too']",The Nurse
