1612945,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00AKOMGZ8,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","{4.5 stars}As you've probably surmised, ABDUCTION of EDEN is not entirely ""fun"" to watch, but it's no more disturbing than it has to be. It's also utterly rewarding in its revelation of an often-ignored problem in this country via a well-detailed and riveting story-line. Director Megan Griffiths did an outstanding job of treading a very thin line, making the film as tasteful as possible considering the subject matter--i.e., no gratuitous nudity--without sugar-coating the story. The level of empathy the audience attains with these poor girls is quite extraordinary. ABDUCTION of EDEN remains convincing despite several unlikelihoods and plot-holes. While this film may appear predictable at first glance, there are some truly unexpected developments here.Though a bit larger-than-life in places in what appears to be a very hopeless situation, Jamie Chung is just hypnotic as victim-heroine ""Eden."" The script is similarly believable and carries a lot of weight in developing Eden and the other characters. The mistrustful alliance she builds with one of her abductors(well-played by Matt O'Leary) is as immediate as everything else in this film and is one of its realest aspects. The supporting cast who play characters we never get to know that well, particularly Tantoo Cardinal as ""The Nurse,"" also contribute a great deal to ABDUCTION of EDEN's success.The ""Behind the Scenes"" Special Feature should not be missed AFTER watching the film itself.",5,Exceptional: One of the Very Best Recent Films,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,1455,"['4.5', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'surmised', 'ABDUCTION', 'EDEN', 'not', 'entirely', 'fun', 'watch', 'more', 'disturbing', 'be', 'also', 'utterly', 'rewarding', 'revelation', 'often-ignored', 'problem', 'country', 'well-detailed', 'riveting', 'story-line', 'Director', 'Megan', 'Griffiths', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'treading', 'very', 'thin', 'line', 'making', 'film', 'as', 'tasteful', 'possible', 'considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'i.e.', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'sugar-coating', 'story', 'level', 'empathy', 'audience', 'poor', 'girls', 'quite', 'extraordinary', 'ABDUCTION', 'EDEN', 'convincing', 'several', 'unlikelihoods', 'plot-holes', 'film', 'may', 'appear', 'predictable', 'first', 'glance', 'are', 'truly', 'unexpected', 'developments', 'bit', 'larger-than-life', 'places', 'what', 'be', 'very', 'hopeless', 'situation', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'just', 'hypnotic', 'victim-heroine', 'Eden', 'script', 'similarly', 'believable', 'lot', 'weight', 'developing', 'Eden', 'other', 'characters', 'mistrustful', 'alliance', 'one', 'abductors', 'well-played', 'Matt', ""O'Leary"", 'as', 'immediate', 'everything', 'else', 'film', 'one', 'realest', 'aspects', 'supporting', 'cast', 'who', 'play', 'characters', 'never', 'get', 'know', 'well', 'particularly', 'Tantoo', 'Cardinal', 'Nurse', 'also', 'contribute', 'great', 'deal', 'ABDUCTION', 'EDEN', 'success.The', 'Scenes', 'Special', 'Feature', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'AFTER', 'watching', 'film']",Eden [Blu-ray]

1612951,A38RF06HMSYVLO,B00AKOMGZ8,"P. A. Clark ""P.A. Clark""","[0, 0]","The Abduction of Eden was film with heavy content overall, but it still manages to bring an important message to light.If you've been skimming the reviews listed here on amazon, you will have read how this film is supposed to be based off of the true story of Chong Kim, when she was abducted in the mid-nineties. However, there are some who now claim that she may have been untruthful about that, due to inconsistencies in her story over the years. In any case, I'm not going to make a judgment on whether she was telling the truth or not.  The situation in the film is nothing to make light of.In the film, Jamie Chung plays the role of Hyun Jae, a high school student who gets abducted one night after she goes out, on what she thinks, is a romantic interlude with a sex trafficking predator. She is driven off to remote facility where she and several other girls are held against their will and are forced into the sex trade. The girls in the film range in age. Some are supposed to be as young as 12 while others look like they may be in their early 20s.Jamie Chung starts by being forced to make an S&M; video where she and another girl are cuffed and then whipped by a dominatrix. Eventually she is forced to see Jon's by her handler, Matt O'Leary. It's a pretty disturbing situation overall and pulls at your heart strings, but that's the purpose of the film, to bring this all to light. You eventually begin to follow Chung's plight and the details of her daily life. The film takes some thrilling twists and turns until it reaches a conclusion where Chung eventually finds a way to free herself from the whole ordeal.I have to say, this film does a good job of depicting the horrors these young girls face once they get abducted into this life. Jamie Chung, in particular, did an excellent job of conveying her emotions at times without using any words. There were several scenes where she had no dialogue at all, but her expressions and demeanor communicated how she was feeling. I can see why she was recognized as an up and coming actress after this role.The film doesn't spend much time on how cruel this world can be in graphic way though. It does however, depict how some girls move up the ranks to try to get more control over the situation they're in. Jamie Chung's character does this to great effect, as she gains the confidence of her pimp. It gains her access to easier jobs that don't include relationships with the Jons.  I guess that's something to strive for, when you're in a bad situation, not of your own making.The other aspect in the film, that I found interesting, was how the sex traffickers justified what they're doing to the girls. The idea that the girls are better off in this lifestyle is mentioned once by Matt O'Leary, since many of them come from bad backgrounds. Such as parents who are drug addicts. Of course that's not a justification, but the way they convince themselves of this is eye opening. The film also shows how volatile this lifestyle can be for the traffickers. Between the drug use; the worries over being backstabbed by others in the organization, and the fear of being caught by authorities, there is plenty for them to stress about.In the end I gave the film a four. The four is mainly due to Jamie Chung's performance, which made the film engaging overall. I also thought the director did a good job of presenting this material without being too pushy and off color with the details. But this is not a film to take lightly. It's a film with heavy undertones. It also reveals how vulnerable young women can be if they are picked up by the wrong guy. It could serve as a good example for young women to be very careful while they're out and about. And about who they are hanging out with. I believe that was one the intended message here.A well-made film, but I'd only recommend it if your have an interest in this story or about how terrible things can be for these girls. Seeing several other films staring Jamie Chung is what brought me to this movie. I was interested in her acting here since she was highly recognized for it. But this is in no way a family movie, nor a good date movie. It's more of an informative film about sex trafficking that still manages to create a thriller-esque type atmosphere along the way. If that's what you're looking for, you can give it a try. Otherwise its not a lighthearted piece.",4,Eye Opening!,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,4381,"['Abduction', 'Eden', 'was', 'film', 'heavy', 'content', 'overall', 'still', 'bring', 'important', 'message', 'light.If', ""'ve"", 'been', 'skimming', 'reviews', 'listed', 'here', 'amazon', 'will', 'have', 'read', 'how', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Chong', 'Kim', 'when', 'was', 'abducted', 'mid-nineties', 'However', 'are', 'who', 'now', 'claim', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'untruthful', 'due', 'inconsistencies', 'story', 'years', 'case', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'make', 'judgment', 'was', 'telling', 'truth', 'not', 'situation', 'film', 'nothing', 'make', 'light', 'film', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'role', 'Hyun', 'Jae', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'abducted', 'one', 'night', 'out', 'what', 'romantic', 'interlude', 'sex', 'trafficking', 'predator', 'driven', 'off', 'remote', 'facility', 'where', 'several', 'other', 'girls', 'are', 'held', 'will', 'are', 'forced', 'sex', 'trade', 'girls', 'film', 'range', 'age', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'as', 'young', '12', 'others', 'look', 'may', 'be', 'early', '20s.Jamie', 'Chung', 'starts', 'being', 'forced', 'make', 'S', 'M', 'video', 'where', 'girl', 'are', 'cuffed', 'then', 'whipped', 'dominatrix', 'Eventually', 'forced', 'see', 'Jon', 'handler', 'Matt', ""O'Leary"", 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'situation', 'overall', 'pulls', 'heart', 'strings', 'purpose', 'film', 'bring', 'light', 'eventually', 'begin', 'follow', 'Chung', 'plight', 'details', 'daily', 'life', 'film', 'thrilling', 'twists', 'conclusion', 'where', 'Chung', 'eventually', 'way', 'free', 'whole', 'ordeal.I', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'depicting', 'horrors', 'young', 'girls', 'face', 'once', 'get', 'abducted', 'life', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'particular', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'conveying', 'emotions', 'times', 'using', 'words', 'were', 'several', 'scenes', 'where', 'had', 'dialogue', 'expressions', 'demeanor', 'communicated', 'how', 'was', 'feeling', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'recognized', 'up', 'coming', 'actress', 'role.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'how', 'cruel', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'graphic', 'way', 'however', 'depict', 'how', 'girls', 'move', 'up', 'ranks', 'try', 'get', 'more', 'control', 'situation', ""'re"", 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'character', 'great', 'effect', 'gains', 'confidence', 'pimp', 'gains', 'access', 'easier', 'jobs', 'do', ""n't"", 'include', 'relationships', 'Jons', 'guess', 'something', 'strive', 'when', ""'re"", 'bad', 'situation', 'not', 'own', 'making.The', 'other', 'aspect', 'film', 'found', 'interesting', 'was', 'how', 'sex', 'traffickers', 'justified', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'girls', 'idea', 'girls', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'lifestyle', 'mentioned', 'once', 'Matt', ""O'Leary"", 'many', 'come', 'bad', 'backgrounds', 'Such', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'drug', 'addicts', 'course', 'not', 'justification', 'way', 'convince', 'eye', 'opening', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'volatile', 'lifestyle', 'can', 'be', 'traffickers', 'drug', 'use', 'worries', 'being', 'backstabbed', 'others', 'organization', 'fear', 'being', 'caught', 'authorities', 'plenty', 'stress', 'end', 'gave', 'film', 'four', 'four', 'mainly', 'due', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'performance', 'made', 'film', 'engaging', 'overall', 'also', 'thought', 'director', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'presenting', 'material', 'being', 'too', 'pushy', 'color', 'details', 'not', 'film', 'take', 'lightly', 'film', 'heavy', 'undertones', 'also', 'how', 'vulnerable', 'young', 'women', 'can', 'be', 'are', 'picked', 'up', 'wrong', 'guy', 'could', 'serve', 'good', 'example', 'young', 'women', 'be', 'very', 'careful', ""'re"", 'out', 'who', 'are', 'hanging', 'out', 'believe', 'was', 'one', 'intended', 'message', 'here.A', 'well-made', 'film', ""'d"", 'only', 'recommend', 'have', 'interest', 'story', 'how', 'terrible', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'girls', 'Seeing', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'staring', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'what', 'brought', 'movie', 'was', 'interested', 'acting', 'here', 'was', 'highly', 'recognized', 'way', 'family', 'movie', 'good', 'date', 'movie', 'more', 'informative', 'film', 'sex', 'trafficking', 'still', 'create', 'thriller-esque', 'type', 'atmosphere', 'way', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'can', 'give', 'try', 'Otherwise', 'not', 'lighthearted', 'piece']",Eden [Blu-ray]

1612956,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B00AKOMGZ8,Todd Smith,"[4, 4]","To me, films like this are the true definition of horror, because they really happened. Anyone can look up the graphic details on Wikipedia and see that not only did it happen here, but it happened fairly recently. Hyun-Jae was just a typical California teenager, who went out to party one night. She met a man, left with him, and quickly learned he wasn't what he appeared to be. Hyun-Jae is sold into prostitution and has no other choice, but to be a sex slave for the next three years. The film was very well done, in that it didn't go over the top. Abduction of Eden showed us, what we needed to see, in order to understand and be shocked by what happened, but it didn't go so far as to desensitize us to the story. Jamie Chung, A.K.A. Stu's wife from the Hangover, stars as Hyun Jae, and her performance was really key to how the audience would react to what was happening. Equally as good, was the jailer, Matthew O'Leary. It took me a while to recognize his as the kid from Domestic Disturbance and Spy Kids 2, and it was shocking to see how quickly he grew up. He was this horrible guy, doing terrible things, but there was a part of you that saw him as trapped as the girls were and you couldn't help but feel sorry for him. The cast makes the film, it's as simple as that. Abduction of Eden was a story that was fast moving and somewhat graphic, but ultimately predictable.

1612957,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00AKOMGZ8,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[3, 4]","Based on a true story &#8216;Eden&#8217; is about a Korean American girl of nineteen who is abducted one night by a criminal gang and is forced into prostitution. They are aided by a corrupt policeman in the shape of Bob Gault played with the right amount of self righteous, brooding contempt by Beau Bridges. The abductee is Jamie Cheung (actually 30 years old) who had me convinced she was an innocent nineteen year old. The prison master and uber pimp Vaughan is played by an eerily threatening yet at the same time, vulnerable Matt O&#8217;Leary in a performance that is full of conviction.The action takes place at a make shift prison in the desert where these girls are &#8216;farmed&#8217; out until they are of no use and then its game over. &#8216;Eden&#8217; is the &#8216;stage name&#8217; given to Cheung by her captors and she realises that her one avenue of escape and/ or survival is to gain the confidence of her gaolers and become, in all but name, one of them.This is a surprisingly good film, despite the subject matter there is no gratuitous sex scenes or indeed nudity, it is mostly done off screen or in such a way as to let your imagination do the work, so this is not a soft porn film by any stretch of the imagination.It is well acted and directed (Megan Griffiths) and tackles a dark and unsettling subject with a lot of care. There are a few plot holes (check out the IMDb page) and some of the on screen antics leave a few questions unanswered, however this is not a history lesson and I feel should be judged as a piece of filmatic entertainment and on that score it rates quite highly indeed.",4,Unsettling True Life Tale of abduction and sex trafficking.,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,1622,"['Based', 'true', 'story', '8216', 'Eden', '8217', 'Korean', 'American', 'girl', 'nineteen', 'who', 'abducted', 'one', 'night', 'criminal', 'gang', 'forced', 'prostitution', 'are', 'aided', 'corrupt', 'policeman', 'shape', 'Bob', 'Gault', 'played', 'right', 'amount', 'self', 'righteous', 'brooding', 'contempt', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'abductee', 'Jamie', 'Cheung', 'actually', '30', 'years', 'old', 'who', 'had', 'convinced', 'was', 'innocent', 'nineteen', 'year', 'old', 'prison', 'master', 'uber', 'pimp', 'Vaughan', 'played', 'eerily', 'threatening', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'vulnerable', 'Matt', 'O', '8217', 'Leary', 'performance', 'full', 'conviction.The', 'action', 'place', 'make', 'shift', 'prison', 'desert', 'where', 'girls', 'are', '8216', 'farmed', '8217', 'are', 'use', 'then', 'game', '8216', 'Eden', '8217', '8216', 'stage', 'name', '8217', 'given', 'Cheung', 'captors', 'one', 'avenue', 'escape', 'and/', 'survival', 'gain', 'confidence', 'gaolers', 'become', 'name', 'one', 'them.This', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scenes', 'indeed', 'nudity', 'mostly', 'done', 'off', 'screen', 'such', 'way', 'let', 'imagination', 'do', 'work', 'not', 'soft', 'porn', 'film', 'stretch', 'imagination.It', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'Megan', 'Griffiths', 'dark', 'unsettling', 'subject', 'lot', 'care', 'are', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'check', 'out', 'IMDb', 'page', 'screen', 'antics', 'leave', 'few', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'however', 'not', 'history', 'lesson', 'feel', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'piece', 'filmatic', 'entertainment', 'score', 'rates', 'quite', 'highly', 'indeed']",Eden [Blu-ray]
