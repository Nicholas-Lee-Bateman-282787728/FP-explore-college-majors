1046782,A3MZ8VR0YRJSYS,B000MKXF46,David,"[0, 0]","Apparently the people that make these movies don't know their Pokemon. Why are all the legendary Pokemon so weak that they need Ash's intervention? Celebi, Manaphy, Latias, Latios, Jirachi, etc.  What happened to all the supposedly powerful Pokemon kicking you-know-what? That's what I wanted to see in the series. But now the series is becoming way too monotonous, tedious, and lethargic. The stories are the same, rehashed, and predictable ones over and over again. All the movies do now is showcase the new Pokemon. There is no story. There is no display of that Pokemon's power. Hopefully the series will realize its potential with the upcoming movies, featuring Darkrai, Giratina, and Arceus. But for now, I suggest you rent rather than buy.",3,"Why are all these ""legendary"" Pokemon so weak?",1291939200,"12 10, 2010",2010,746,"['Apparently', 'people', 'make', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Pokemon', 'Why', 'are', 'legendary', 'Pokemon', 'so', 'weak', 'need', 'Ash', 'intervention', 'Celebi', 'Manaphy', 'Latias', 'Latios', 'Jirachi', 'etc', 'What', 'happened', 'supposedly', 'powerful', 'Pokemon', 'kicking', 'you-know-what', 'what', 'wanted', 'see', 'series', 'now', 'series', 'becoming', 'way', 'too', 'monotonous', 'tedious', 'lethargic', 'stories', 'are', 'same', 'rehashed', 'predictable', 'ones', 'over', 'again', 'movies', 'do', 'now', 'showcase', 'new', 'Pokemon', 'story', 'display', 'Pokemon', 'power', 'Hopefully', 'series', 'will', 'realize', 'potential', 'upcoming', 'movies', 'featuring', 'Darkrai', 'Giratina', 'Arceus', 'now', 'suggest', 'rent', 'rather', 'buy']",Pokemon Movie - Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea
1046783,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B000MKXF46,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","When I first started watching Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea it seemed like a dramatic visual upgrade from the previous movies. The colors are extremely bright and it mixes in a lot of nice CGI but the longer I watched it the less impressed I became. The character animation is mediocre at best and the backgrounds are only decent and the whole thing was just overly shiny. I much prefer the art from the Diamond/Pearl series that started with Rise of Darkrai. As with all the movies the plot centers around a hard to get legendary Pokemon, in this case Manaphy who was only available by playing Pokemon Ranger for the DS. Manaphy is the single most annoying Pokemon I have ever seen. I know that the language of most Pokemon is limited to repeating their own names but good Lord, Manaphy just continues to repeat `Mana, Mana, Mana' over and over and over again until it becomes torturous. Adults beware; this is one Pokemon that will irritate you to no end even if you're only hearing it from the next room over. In fact if your child is watching the movie in the next room you'll likely only hear Manaphy's shrill whine repeating Mana, Mana, Mana for what will seam like an eternity.The protagonist of the story is Captain Phantom (think Captain Crunch with more attitude) and his group of sharp dressed pirates. They're in a quest against the Pokemon Rangers to get Manaphy, who can lead them to the treasure laden Sea Temple. The story isn't going to win any creativity awards. Now normally I like pirates and stories that take place in the Caribbean but this one just did not capture my attention. Maybe it was just the `Mana, Mana, Mana, Happy, Happy, Happy' that just drove me to distraction but I really didn't get into it at all and the ending was just goofy. This is one movie that will probably only appeal to young Pokemon fans. I would suggest skipping this one and heading straight to the Diamond/Pearl movies which are probably the only Pokemon movies that will appeal to viewers older than preteen.",3,Manaphy - The Worlds Most Annoying Pokemon,1275609600,"06 4, 2010",2010,2024,"['When', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'Pokemon', 'Ranger', 'Temple', 'Sea', 'seemed', 'dramatic', 'visual', 'upgrade', 'previous', 'movies', 'colors', 'are', 'extremely', 'bright', 'lot', 'nice', 'CGI', 'longer', 'watched', 'less', 'impressed', 'became', 'character', 'animation', 'mediocre', 'best', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'only', 'decent', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'just', 'overly', 'shiny', 'much', 'prefer', 'art', 'Diamond/Pearl', 'series', 'started', 'Rise', 'Darkrai', 'movies', 'plot', 'centers', 'hard', 'get', 'legendary', 'Pokemon', 'case', 'Manaphy', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'available', 'playing', 'Pokemon', 'Ranger', 'DS', 'Manaphy', 'single', 'most', 'annoying', 'Pokemon', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'know', 'language', 'most', 'Pokemon', 'limited', 'repeating', 'own', 'names', 'good', 'Lord', 'Manaphy', 'just', 'repeat', 'Mana', 'Mana', 'Mana', 'over', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'torturous', 'Adults', 'beware', 'one', 'Pokemon', 'will', 'irritate', 'end', 'even', ""'re"", 'only', 'hearing', 'next', 'room', 'fact', 'child', 'watching', 'movie', 'next', 'room', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'only', 'hear', 'Manaphy', 'shrill', 'whine', 'repeating', 'Mana', 'Mana', 'Mana', 'what', 'will', 'seam', 'eternity.The', 'protagonist', 'story', 'Captain', 'Phantom', 'think', 'Captain', 'Crunch', 'more', 'attitude', 'group', 'sharp', 'dressed', 'pirates', ""'re"", 'quest', 'Pokemon', 'Rangers', 'get', 'Manaphy', 'who', 'can', 'lead', 'treasure', 'laden', 'Sea', 'Temple', 'story', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'creativity', 'awards', 'Now', 'normally', 'like', 'pirates', 'stories', 'take', 'place', 'Caribbean', 'one', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'capture', 'attention', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'Mana', 'Mana', 'Mana', 'Happy', 'Happy', 'Happy', 'just', 'drove', 'distraction', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'goofy', 'one', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'only', 'appeal', 'young', 'Pokemon', 'fans', 'would', 'suggest', 'skipping', 'one', 'heading', 'straight', 'Diamond/Pearl', 'movies', 'are', 'probably', 'only', 'Pokemon', 'movies', 'will', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'older', 'preteen']",Pokemon Movie - Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea

1046785,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B000MKXF46,Lesley Aeschliman,"[0, 0]","Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea is the ninth film in the Pokemon franchise, and was directed by Kunihiko Yuyama, and it was released as a two-disc set.  On the first DVD, you can play the movie, choose which scene you want to start watching the movie at, and you can choose to have English captions for the Hearing Impaired.  Three special features are included on this disc.  The first is ""Location Scouting.""  This documentary runs for about ten minutes, and it shows the director and the crew scouting out locations in Italy to help inspire the locations in the film.  It also include interviews with the director, the writer, and the composer; however, whenever they speak, an English narrator speaks over them instead of seeing subtitles on the screen.  Next is ""Art Slideshow.""  This feature runs for one minute and ten seconds, and only features production art of the characters that were designed specifically for this film.  Also, the viewer has no control over when the images change on the screen.  The final extra is labeled as ""Interactive.""  It's a splash screen that promotes the official Pokemon website, the Pokemon Learning League, and Pokemon Mobile.The second disc contains ""Pikachu's Island Adventure,"" the short that accompanied the film when it aired in Japanese theaters.  In the short. Pikachu and the other Pokemon traveling with Ash and his friends are going to play on an island that's full of fun and adventure.  However, they encounter some Wynaut and a couple of Pichu who were chased off the island by Meowth and its gang.  It's up to Pikachu and friends to teach the Wynaut and Pichu how to stand up for themselves.  This was the first of the shorts to be dubbed by The Pokemon Company, and a decision was made to have the narrator give dialogue for the Pokemon in addition to hearing the Pokemon make their natural noises when they speak.  I personally didn't like this, as it felt like the narrator was talking down to the audience.  I also thought it was a little insulting that The Pokemon Company felt the audience wasn't smart enough to be able to figure out what was going on through the images on the screen.  However, this short was the only item included on the disc.  Personally, I thought this was a waste.  It would have been better to include the short on the first DVD, and to have released Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea as a single disc.The movie is one of the longer films in the Pokemon franchise, but it's still good viewing if you enjoy Pokemon.  The major downside is how much 3D animation the director tried to include, and just how much the 3D animation sticks out like a sore thumb in comparison to the elements that were animated with traditional animation.  Even with the issues I have with this release, I would still recommend it to Pokemon fans, especially ones who want to have a complete Pokemon DVD collection.",3,This would have been better as a single DVD release,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,2895,"['Pokemon', 'Ranger', 'Temple', 'Sea', 'ninth', 'film', 'Pokemon', 'franchise', 'was', 'directed', 'Kunihiko', 'Yuyama', 'was', 'released', 'two-disc', 'set', 'first', 'DVD', 'can', 'play', 'movie', 'choose', 'scene', 'want', 'start', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'choose', 'have', 'English', 'captions', 'Hearing', 'Impaired', 'Three', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'disc', 'first', 'Location', 'Scouting', 'documentary', 'runs', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'director', 'crew', 'scouting', 'out', 'locations', 'Italy', 'help', 'inspire', 'locations', 'film', 'also', 'include', 'interviews', 'director', 'writer', 'composer', 'however', 'whenever', 'speak', 'English', 'narrator', 'speaks', 'instead', 'seeing', 'subtitles', 'screen', 'Next', 'Art', 'Slideshow', 'feature', 'one', 'minute', 'ten', 'seconds', 'only', 'production', 'art', 'characters', 'were', 'designed', 'specifically', 'film', 'Also', 'viewer', 'control', 'when', 'images', 'change', 'screen', 'final', 'extra', 'labeled', 'Interactive', 'splash', 'screen', 'official', 'Pokemon', 'website', 'Pokemon', 'Learning', 'League', 'Pokemon', 'Mobile.The', 'second', 'disc', 'Pikachu', 'Island', 'Adventure', 'short', 'accompanied', 'film', 'when', 'aired', 'Japanese', 'theaters', 'short', 'Pikachu', 'other', 'Pokemon', 'traveling', 'Ash', 'friends', 'are', 'going', 'play', 'island', 'full', 'fun', 'adventure', 'However', 'encounter', 'Wynaut', 'couple', 'Pichu', 'who', 'were', 'chased', 'off', 'island', 'Meowth', 'gang', 'up', 'Pikachu', 'friends', 'teach', 'Wynaut', 'Pichu', 'how', 'stand', 'up', 'was', 'first', 'shorts', 'be', 'dubbed', 'Pokemon', 'Company', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'have', 'narrator', 'give', 'dialogue', 'Pokemon', 'addition', 'hearing', 'Pokemon', 'make', 'natural', 'noises', 'when', 'speak', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'felt', 'narrator', 'was', 'talking', 'down', 'audience', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'insulting', 'Pokemon', 'Company', 'felt', 'audience', 'was', ""n't"", 'smart', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'images', 'screen', 'However', 'short', 'was', 'only', 'item', 'included', 'disc', 'Personally', 'thought', 'was', 'waste', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'include', 'short', 'first', 'DVD', 'have', 'released', 'Pokemon', 'Ranger', 'Temple', 'Sea', 'single', 'disc.The', 'movie', 'one', 'longer', 'films', 'Pokemon', 'franchise', 'still', 'good', 'viewing', 'enjoy', 'Pokemon', 'major', 'downside', 'how', 'much', '3D', 'animation', 'director', 'tried', 'include', 'just', 'how', 'much', '3D', 'animation', 'sticks', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'comparison', 'elements', 'were', 'animated', 'traditional', 'animation', 'Even', 'issues', 'have', 'release', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'Pokemon', 'fans', 'especially', 'ones', 'who', 'want', 'have', 'complete', 'Pokemon', 'DVD', 'collection']",Pokemon Movie - Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea
