Would have loved them to release this as it originally aired, but I guess we'll have to settle for this release, as I don't think we'll see another. Can't understand why the people who put together these DVDs feel they have to change or omit parts of the program.",4,"Not PC anymore, but classic Saturday morning.",1252972800,"09 15, 2009",2009,367,"['Grab', 'bowl', 'cereal', 'remember', 'time', 'when', 'things', 'were', 'lot', 'simpler', 'Saturdays', 'lasted', 'forever', 'Would', 'have', 'loved', 'release', 'originally', 'aired', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'settle', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'who', 'put', 'together', 'DVDs', 'feel', 'have', 'change', 'omit', 'parts', 'program']",N/A

The intro to each cartoon has been removed.  The DVD just goes from one cartoon to the next without any intro or title card.  Originally there was the theme song opening, followed by a short title board for each cartoon.  Well, all we have here is the theme song played once at the beginning of the DVD, and closing credits at the very end.  Everything else, including all the title cards, has been stripped away.  It's bad enough we can't get these episodes as part of a complete Underdog package, but now we can't even get the complete Go-Go Gophers on their own DVD.  The cartoons themselves look and sound good, but 75% of the charm of these has been edited out.  Save your money and don't buy this garbage.  Hopefully the Tennessee Tuxedo package is better, but I doubt it.",1,Charming Cartoons - Terrible DVD by Sony,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,882,"['loved', 'cartoons', 'child', 'still', 'However', 'compilation', 'abomination', 'intro', 'cartoon', 'been', 'removed', 'DVD', 'just', 'one', 'cartoon', 'next', 'intro', 'title', 'card', 'Originally', 'was', 'theme', 'song', 'opening', 'followed', 'short', 'title', 'board', 'cartoon', 'Well', 'have', 'here', 'theme', 'song', 'played', 'once', 'beginning', 'DVD', 'closing', 'credits', 'very', 'end', 'Everything', 'else', 'including', 'title', 'cards', 'been', 'stripped', 'away', 'bad', 'enough', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'episodes', 'part', 'complete', 'Underdog', 'package', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'complete', 'Go-Go', 'Gophers', 'own', 'DVD', 'cartoons', 'look', 'sound', 'good', '75', '%', 'charm', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'Save', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'garbage', 'Hopefully', 'Tennessee', 'Tuxedo', 'package', 'better', 'doubt']",N/A
