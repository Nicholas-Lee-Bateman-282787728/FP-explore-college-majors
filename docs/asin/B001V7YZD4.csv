I can't imagine this show without him.  He has been the  anchor to the whole series. Besides, this also makes his wife and daughter unnecessary as well and they were vital too.These final Nettles' episodes are terrific.  As usual, we have idyllic English settings and gatherings where the grisliest murders intrude. One episode is set in Brighton, a seaside town famous as a retreat for the ton of the regency during the summers. Nowadays going to the beach and the rides adjacent to it are where most of the action occurs. So naturally a guy gets his head cut off in the haunted house.Another episode involves Tom and Joyce going to rest at a spa.  So, of course, the bodies start piling up shortly after they check in.  Joyce encounters the first body when she enters an isolation tank. It is a real hoot seeing Tom trying to relax at a spa.Another episode shows a Wild West show going on in a bucolic English village setting.  This is enormously popular and the villagers even belong year long to wild west societies based on the American old West.  They build fake saloons, have shootouts between Billy the Kid and the marshall, and so forth. We think of the Brits as anti guns but this is not true in these villages with the country sporting life accent.  EVERYONE owns a shotgun and uses it regularly.Tom retires in the final episode of this season and his cousin, John Barnaby, a DCI from Brighton, steps into his job.",5,Last Season Starring Nettles as Tom Barnaby,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,1587,"['great', 'season', 'relished', 'moment', 'knew', 'John', 'Nettles', 'was', 'quitting', 'season', 'letting', 'actor', 'carry', 'season', 'fourteen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'show', 'been', 'anchor', 'whole', 'series', 'Besides', 'also', 'wife', 'daughter', 'unnecessary', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'vital', 'too.These', 'final', 'Nettles', 'episodes', 'are', 'terrific', 'usual', 'have', 'idyllic', 'English', 'settings', 'gatherings', 'where', 'grisliest', 'murders', 'intrude', 'One', 'episode', 'set', 'Brighton', 'seaside', 'town', 'famous', 'retreat', 'ton', 'regency', 'summers', 'going', 'beach', 'rides', 'adjacent', 'are', 'where', 'most', 'action', 'So', 'naturally', 'guy', 'head', 'cut', 'off', 'haunted', 'house.Another', 'episode', 'Tom', 'Joyce', 'going', 'rest', 'spa', 'So', 'course', 'bodies', 'start', 'piling', 'up', 'shortly', 'check', 'Joyce', 'first', 'body', 'when', 'isolation', 'tank', 'real', 'hoot', 'seeing', 'Tom', 'trying', 'relax', 'spa.Another', 'episode', 'Wild', 'West', 'show', 'going', 'bucolic', 'English', 'village', 'setting', 'enormously', 'popular', 'villagers', 'even', 'year', 'long', 'wild', 'west', 'societies', 'based', 'American', 'old', 'West', 'build', 'fake', 'saloons', 'have', 'shootouts', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'marshall', 'so', 'forth', 'think', 'Brits', 'anti', 'guns', 'not', 'true', 'villages', 'country', 'sporting', 'life', 'accent', 'EVERYONE', 'shotgun', 'regularly.Tom', 'final', 'episode', 'season', 'cousin', 'John', 'Barnaby', 'DCI', 'Brighton', 'job']",Midsomer Murders: Set 13 (Dance with the Dead / The Animal Within / King's Crystal / The Axeman Cometh)

1243284,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B001V7YZD4,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 2]","Is Midsomer Murders starting to show its kinky side? With set 13 we have the love that dare not speak its name, the love that encourages us to think about the love that dare not speak its name, photo pornography (so artistic it's called erotica) that appears to explore the missionary position with a real missionary, and, perhaps most disturbing, the sight of DCS Tom Barnaby playing air guitar. Kinky or not, its all good. As we know from past seasons, murders occur regularly in the villages of Midsomer County. The landscape is idyllically English, with ample greensward, manicured lawns, carefully trimmed hedges, cozy cottages and perfect gardens. If it weren't for all the corpses, the villages and towns of Midsomer County would be a fine place to live. As it is, they're a fine place to die.It's up to Detective Chief Superintendent Tom Barnaby, unflappable, courteous, curious and relentless, to solve these murders. He does, and with a sly, dry sense of humor that should make a smart murderer wary. DCS Barnaby is played by John Nettles, and it's hard to say who is the more authentic, the actor or the character. The one thing for sure is that it's a perfect fit. Nettles makes the series work. When he as Barnaby comes on the scene, we know we're in for an intelligent, well written, very British, understated and amusing series of lethal riddles and satisfying solutions.The four 100-minute mysteries in Set 13 are:Dance With the Dead, a trip into WWII nostalgia, complete with townspeople at a dance in the dress and uniforms of the time and a vocalist giving us ""I'll Be Seeing You"" and ""Goodnight, Sweetheart."" Death appears in an abandoned WWII airfield with a steel pipe in its hand.The Animal Within brings us secrets from the past, a biographer who loves his mum, and an old reprobate who, in hindsight, didn't mind a bit of genial corruption.King's Crystal teaches us the economics of a small glass-blowing company, where Shakespeare gives us hints, some misleading, and where the economies of murder can be profitable.The Axeman Cometh is a paean to rock and roll, loud rock and roll, and where old-time drug use can have modern-time consequences.The series features Jason Hughes as Detective Constable Ben Jones. Hughes is a fine, intelligent actor, but I'm afraid the series writers may be dumbing down his intelligence a bit. At times he seems just a dull foil for Barnaby. Jane Wymark plays Joyce Barnaby, the Detective Chief Superintendent's wife and Laura Howard is Cully, their daughter. We don't see much of either in this set.Considering how long this show has been running, it has maintained a remarkably high level of twisty plots, solid writing, fine acting in even the smallest parts and quality Midsomer ambience. Nettles, of course, makes the series. He has been quoted as saying he will retire after two more seasons. The producers have been quoted as saying there will be a new DCS to carry on in Midsomer County. Whoever the actor turns out to be, he (she? Why not?) will have big shoes to fill.For those with long memories, it's a pleasure to spot some fine actors in supporting roles, such as David Troughton, John Cater, Richard Johnson, John Castle and David Horovitch.",5,A walk on the kinky side for Midsomer County's DCS Tom Barnaby.

1243285,A126Q2HVTCS9P2,B001V7YZD4,"D. Duggan ""IT Specialist""","[1, 1]","For anyone who enjoys good murder mysteries in the English style, this series is a two thumbs up. I'm a huge Agatha Christie fan, and I think this series is worthy of her. Caroline Graham was the original author of five of the series early episodes based on her books. The rest are delightfully clever. The most original part of the Midsomer Murders is Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby who is a happily married man with a grown daughter. His interaction with his family and his assistant is completely lacking the angst usually associated with police dramas. It makes this a thoroughly enjoyable series.I've never bought a TV series before, but American television has stopped showing the Midsommer Murders. The stories are intricately written, the conclusions are logical, the acting is first rate, and the body count doesn't stop at one. The English country settings are both quaint and surprising. I'm sure no English village ever had so much mayhem visited upon them in real life.Even the violence is kept to a shadowy minimum. Like Agatha Christie, the violence is mostly implied, and the audience only sees the aftermath, hears the noise, or sees the movement of a weapon. Tom Barnaby treats every suspect and witness with sensitivity and respect, but doesn't allow the perpetrator to escape justice.This is actually good family fare -- basically PG13 -- and a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. So, prepare a big bowl of buttered popcorn, settle in on the sofa or your favorite chair, and enjoy a remarkable story. Make room for Tom Barnaby, Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot.I recommend this series for any mystery buff.",5,I Love a Mystery,1267660800,"03 4, 2010",2010,1631,"['anyone', 'who', 'good', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'English', 'style', 'series', 'two', 'thumbs', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'fan', 'think', 'series', 'worthy', 'Caroline', 'Graham', 'was', 'original', 'author', 'five', 'series', 'early', 'episodes', 'based', 'books', 'rest', 'are', 'delightfully', 'clever', 'most', 'original', 'part', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'Detective', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Tom', 'Barnaby', 'who', 'happily', 'married', 'man', 'grown', 'daughter', 'interaction', 'family', 'assistant', 'completely', 'lacking', 'angst', 'usually', 'associated', 'police', 'dramas', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'series.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'bought', 'TV', 'series', 'American', 'television', 'stopped', 'showing', 'Midsommer', 'Murders', 'stories', 'are', 'intricately', 'written', 'conclusions', 'are', 'logical', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'body', 'count', ""n't"", 'stop', 'one', 'English', 'country', 'settings', 'are', 'quaint', 'surprising', ""'m"", 'sure', 'English', 'village', 'ever', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'mayhem', 'visited', 'real', 'life.Even', 'violence', 'kept', 'shadowy', 'minimum', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'violence', 'mostly', 'implied', 'audience', 'only', 'aftermath', 'noise', 'movement', 'weapon', 'Tom', 'Barnaby', 'suspect', 'witness', 'sensitivity', 'respect', ""n't"", 'allow', 'perpetrator', 'escape', 'justice.This', 'actually', 'good', 'family', 'fare', 'basically', 'PG13', 'pleasant', 'way', 'spend', 'afternoon', 'So', 'prepare', 'big', 'bowl', 'buttered', 'popcorn', 'settle', 'sofa', 'favorite', 'chair', 'enjoy', 'remarkable', 'story', 'Make', 'room', 'Tom', 'Barnaby', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'Hercule', 'Poirot.I', 'recommend', 'series', 'mystery', 'buff']",Midsomer Murders: Set 13 (Dance with the Dead / The Animal Within / King's Crystal / The Axeman Cometh)

The series is set in the fictional Misomer County, which comprises of many cosy, rural villages, where wealthy and poor alike seem to do each other in at an average rate of three to four bodies per episode. The series has a worldwide following, not in the least due to the creative and macabre ways in which the MM victims are typically dispatched. I give the series as a whole a five star rating, though set 12 was a bit dissapointing (four stars) in that it lacked some of its trademark British humour which in the past acted as a buffer between the viewer and the grim reality of the bloody murders... Let's hope Set 13 sees MM back to its best form!Set 13 contains the following episodes:ep 52: Dance With the Dead; orig air date: Nov 2006ep 53: The Animal Within;  orig air date: Jan 2007ep 54: King's Crystal;  orig air date: Jan 2007ep 55: The Axeman Cometh;  orig air date: Feb 2007SPOILER ALERT!!!: In The Axeman Cometh we meet Simon, Cully's intended. Her wedding is in ep 60 (which I guess will be in set 15). END OF SPOILER ALERT!!!If you own any MM sets from Region 2, you may already own at least some of the above episodes, as the Region 1 and 2 sets are NOT synchronised. Better check... I read somewhere there were fewer MM episodes released in the US in order to keep the price of each set more affordable. If that was indeed the case, then it is a great shame... I would like to see those missing episodes released at some point in the US as well.PS: As a side note, John Nettles is retiring soon, though we should see Barnaby episodes well into 2011. The makers are still shopping for a suitable lead who will pick up the baton. All they will confirm is that Barnaby will NOT be killed off, and that his current sidekick (played by Jason Hugh) is NOT in the running. The actress playing Cully has already retired from MM (her last episode was shown on British TV this summer; it was her character's wedding episode).UPDATE (Feb 10, 2010): Nettles' replacement has been revealed.
