Although he has a girlfriend, Lucas wonders, as does the viewer, if there isn't something missing.Much of the pleasure of this film is in the small touches as the story unfolds, as we see Lucas come to the realization that this new friendship is developing into something more meaningful. From here the movie unfolds to it's very moving and satisfying conclusion.You may find yourself wanting to watch this movie more than once, especially when you see how it ends. Repeated viewings only seem to make the story more meaningful.This movie is a story of coming out, of being true to yourself, and the tremendous power of love.",4,A Truly Moving Love Story,1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,1189,"['Few', 'gay', 'themed', 'stories', 'are', 'touching', 'moving', 'one', 'Martin', 'gay', 'man', 'Lucas', 'seemingly', 'straight', 'man', 'whom', 'fallen', 'love', 'with.Maybe', 'fact', 'Martin', 'living', 'AIDS', 'realizes', 'time', 'precious', 'just', 'what', 'filling', 'Lucas', 'way', 'feeling', 'first', 'Lucas', ""n't"", 'seem', 'share.But', 'two', 'become', 'friends', 'do', 'begin', 'realize', 'Lucas', 'something', 'more', 'developing', 'something', 'never', 'thought', 'possible', 'did', 'girlfriend', 'Lucas', 'wonders', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'something', 'missing.Much', 'pleasure', 'film', 'small', 'touches', 'story', 'unfolds', 'see', 'Lucas', 'come', 'realization', 'new', 'friendship', 'developing', 'something', 'more', 'meaningful', 'here', 'movie', 'very', 'moving', 'satisfying', 'conclusion.You', 'may', 'find', 'wanting', 'watch', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'especially', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'Repeated', 'viewings', 'only', 'seem', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'meaningful.This', 'movie', 'story', 'coming', 'out', 'being', 'true', 'yourself', 'tremendous', 'power', 'love']",The Man I Love

775129,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B0000CBL9I,Get What We Give,"[10, 20]","After reading many of the previous reviews for this film, I am struck dumb, wondering if the reviewers had seen the same film I had.The acting is quite fine, but the storyline has a terribly unbelievable ""fantasy"" premise that has more holes than a block of Swiss cheese.Homosexual swimming pool manager, Martin, falls hard for hot heterosexual diver and lifeguard, Lucas, immediately upon seeing him. He confesses his love to him after knowing him for all of ten minutes.How old is this guy?12?I don't care if he DOES have AIDS. It's stupid. No mature man, ill or not, runs around putting himself at emotional risk in such a short period of time - and this doesn't apply to just gay men. In fact, the very idea that a gay man would approach a straight man after knowing him so briefly and confess his love to the straight man, is patently offensive to me as a gay man. It only furthers the straight Nazi mentality in their belief that we are sick and amoral and out to recruit members.This stupendously juvenile storyline adds insult to injury when Lucas quite quickly, and without any acknowledgement of prior self doubt or curiosity, up and leaves his live-in girlfriend to begin sleeping with AIDS-stricken Martin.Think about it peopele - think about when you have ever divulged your homosexuality to a straight man. What was his reaction? What was his reaction when you told him you loved him? If it was positive, can you imagine that it would have been positive had you also told him that you had AIDS? Get real!We are provided with no information to make us believe that Lucas is any more evolved than most other straight men with regard to homosexuality or AIDS. The only sliver along that thought line is that his father is a doctor who treats men with AIDS. HOWEVER, he and his father haven't spoken in quite a long time.Lucas, for all intents and purposes, is straight and much like any other straight man (evolved or otherwise) is not inclined to venture into homosexuality unless it is due to alcohol or drugs (my thoughts, not the films). So why is it that it only takes Martin (whom I found to be more than a little annoying) only a few attempts before he's gotten not only Lucas in bed with him, but supporting him at AIDS protests, AIDS functions, gay bars...all without once even batting his eyes at the fact that he is sleeping with someone who is not just sick, but very much dying of the disease.The transition is far too relaxed and unbelievable. Men, gay or straight, just don't nonchalantly hop into someone's bed once they know their HIV status is positive. It just doesn't happen, unless the person is completely naive (and we know Lucas to be anything but).Then there's Martin's mother... What an evolved woman! And what good casting! She looks just like Martin (and that's not a good thing). When I saw the character at first - I thought it was a drag queen. This is one seriously homely woman. She has an enormous schnoz and a big ol' head. She's a good actress and I found her dialogue to be very much believable to the situation in which she is.Now, my best friend is French, so I know them to be the drama queens that Martin is (not an insult, just an observation). So that much is real.Lucas is just too darned accepting of every problem that comes down the pike. He's not the least bit surprised that he's discovered that he's gay or that his father has discovered it or that his girlfriend has discovered it. (Where's the French emotion here?).No, I think the reviewers who have really liked this film are hopeless romantics who want their love stories syrupy and maudlin with no hints of reality. I prefer the latter.Other than the acting and the interesting scenery, The Man I Love was all fairy tale (in more ways than one).Don't bother.",2,Well acted albeit unbelievable French AIDS storyline,1117670400,"06 2, 2005",2005,3775,"['reading', 'many', 'previous', 'reviews', 'film', 'am', 'struck', 'dumb', 'wondering', 'reviewers', 'had', 'seen', 'same', 'film', 'had.The', 'acting', 'quite', 'fine', 'storyline', 'terribly', 'unbelievable', 'fantasy', 'premise', 'more', 'holes', 'block', 'Swiss', 'cheese.Homosexual', 'swimming', 'pool', 'manager', 'Martin', 'hard', 'hot', 'heterosexual', 'diver', 'lifeguard', 'Lucas', 'immediately', 'seeing', 'love', 'knowing', 'ten', 'minutes.How', 'old', 'guy', '12', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'have', 'AIDS', 'stupid', 'mature', 'man', 'ill', 'not', 'putting', 'emotional', 'risk', 'such', 'short', 'period', 'time', ""n't"", 'apply', 'just', 'gay', 'men', 'fact', 'very', 'idea', 'gay', 'man', 'would', 'approach', 'straight', 'man', 'knowing', 'so', 'briefly', 'confess', 'love', 'straight', 'man', 'patently', 'offensive', 'gay', 'man', 'only', 'straight', 'Nazi', 'mentality', 'belief', 'are', 'sick', 'amoral', 'recruit', 'members.This', 'stupendously', 'juvenile', 'storyline', 'insult', 'injury', 'when', 'Lucas', 'quite', 'quickly', 'acknowledgement', 'prior', 'self', 'doubt', 'curiosity', 'up', 'live-in', 'girlfriend', 'begin', 'sleeping', 'AIDS-stricken', 'Martin.Think', 'think', 'when', 'have', 'ever', 'divulged', 'homosexuality', 'straight', 'man', 'What', 'was', 'reaction', 'What', 'was', 'reaction', 'when', 'told', 'loved', 'was', 'positive', 'can', 'imagine', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'positive', 'had', 'also', 'told', 'had', 'AIDS', 'Get', 'real', 'are', 'provided', 'information', 'make', 'believe', 'Lucas', 'more', 'evolved', 'most', 'other', 'straight', 'men', 'regard', 'homosexuality', 'AIDS', 'only', 'sliver', 'thought', 'line', 'father', 'doctor', 'who', 'men', 'AIDS', 'HOWEVER', 'father', 'have', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'quite', 'long', 'time.Lucas', 'intents', 'purposes', 'straight', 'much', 'other', 'straight', 'man', 'evolved', 'otherwise', 'not', 'inclined', 'venture', 'homosexuality', 'due', 'alcohol', 'drugs', 'thoughts', 'not', 'films', 'why', 'only', 'Martin', 'whom', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'little', 'annoying', 'only', 'few', 'attempts', 'gotten', 'not', 'only', 'Lucas', 'bed', 'supporting', 'AIDS', 'protests', 'AIDS', 'functions', 'gay', 'bars', 'once', 'even', 'batting', 'eyes', 'fact', 'sleeping', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'just', 'sick', 'very', 'much', 'dying', 'disease.The', 'transition', 'far', 'too', 'relaxed', 'unbelievable', 'Men', 'gay', 'straight', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'nonchalantly', 'hop', 'someone', 'bed', 'know', 'HIV', 'status', 'positive', 'just', ""n't"", 'happen', 'person', 'completely', 'naive', 'know', 'Lucas', 'be', 'anything', '.Then', 'Martin', 'mother', 'What', 'evolved', 'woman', 'what', 'good', 'casting', 'just', 'like', 'Martin', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'When', 'saw', 'character', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'drag', 'queen', 'one', 'seriously', 'homely', 'woman', 'enormous', 'schnoz', 'big', 'ol', 'head', 'good', 'actress', 'found', 'dialogue', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'believable', 'situation', 'best', 'friend', 'French', 'know', 'be', 'drama', 'Martin', 'not', 'insult', 'just', 'observation', 'much', 'real.Lucas', 'just', 'too', 'darned', 'accepting', 'problem', 'down', 'pike', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'surprised', 'discovered', 'gay', 'father', 'discovered', 'girlfriend', 'discovered', 'Where', 'French', 'emotion', 'here', '.No', 'think', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'are', 'hopeless', 'romantics', 'who', 'want', 'love', 'stories', 'syrupy', 'maudlin', 'hints', 'reality', 'prefer', 'latter.Other', 'acting', 'interesting', 'scenery', 'Man', 'Love', 'was', 'fairy', 'tale', 'more', 'ways', 'one', '.Do', ""n't"", 'bother']",The Man I Love

I was pleasantly surprised.  I got caught up with these characters and have difficulty understanding the negative reviews.  The negative rant from ""Atlanta Native"" purports the unbelievability factor. . . and he's gay!  It's a movie, everything and anything is within the realm of the possible. I had no difficulty in Lucas's journey as he slowly falls in love with Martin.  When we meet Lucas he is icy, bitter and removed.  He's accustomed to luxury, having his own way, and used to rules and laws being bent or broken to accommodate him.  His introduction to Martin is a bracing, instantaneous jolt of reality, an indication that the real world is not so perfect.  Martin may (and does) annoy and repulse him, but Lucas has now been shocked out of an existence of an almost catatonic complacency.  Martin annoys and repulses him.The small ensemble cast are each absolutely perfect and watching their individual journeys is a nice insight into another world.  The cinematography and locations in and around Marseilles are absolutely breathtaking.This is far more than a gay love story, it's a story about hope, perceptions of reality, taking risks and believing in the magic and glory of the human spirit.  This movie could never have been made in Hollywood.

775131,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0000CBL9I,Grady Harp,"[70, 74]","Perhaps the French do indeed have the market on love stories. THE MAN I LOVE is the improbable tale of a young gay man (Martin) living with AIDS who falls in love with an apparently straight diver and swim coach (Lucas) who comes to work at the Centre Nautique where Martin is the pool boy/janitor. Martin is so comfortable and carefree with his sexuality that he immediately pledges his attraction to the somewhat confused Lucas. Martin follows Lucas home where he lives with an especially lovely young Lise who immediately is infatuated with Martin's ability to use sign language (Lise teaches in a school for the hearing impaired) and encourages the mortified Lucas to include Martin in their social life. Things progress, Martin realizes he is coming to the end of his struggle with AIDS, invites his mother to meet Lucas, and gradually Lucas embraces his bisexuality and falls in love with Martin. All of this story is played (by an exceptional cast) as a simple tale of love and it is because of this honesty that the film succeeds. There is a tendency to push the Act Up movement - Martin's extended family engage in a laying in strike against the hospital for the French government's lack of AIDS research and treatment venues - but even this bit of grandstanding shows passion and compassion in a very real manner. The ending of the film, while edging a bit towards the saccharine, manages to quickly fall back in step and leaves the viewer with a sense of the power of love....as only the French can do!

775133,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B0000CBL9I,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[1, 2]","---------------------------((....watch for that first kiss......on the neck............it's...))--------------------------CHAPTER I----Wherein we are introduced to a wondrous and heart-lifting love, a love being given us............by the French, who have long been renowned as masters of old-fashioned, romantic film-making, usually involving man and woman. But 'usually' is not the case here, because what they instead bestow upon us is a tale of a 'different kind of love'----one that is showcased in a marvelous, but largely unheralded, 1997 film entitled: ""The Man I Love."" Surprisingly made for French TV, this is an Aids-related story of gay love being found while at the same time being lost. It literally ""vibrates"" with a style that's been pretty much unique to the French. Unique, that is, until the more recent arrival of such gay-themed, American-produced titles as ""All Over the Guy"" and, newer still, ""Latter Days"" and ""Brokeback Mountain."" In these productions, US filmmakers at last approach the French in 'realistically' depicting gay love.....and by 'love' I mean a couple's not only making a total commitment to one another but doing so openly (except for ""Brokeback""). Embarrassingly, up until around the year, 2000, American-based directors and their lead male couples never quite appeared to be completely and truly comfortable and at ease in the gay love they were attempting to put across on the screen. But it is just such a high level of comfort and ease which was earlier captured in ""The Man I Love,"" a motion picture in which you can actually visualize love emerging and growing.....something that would seem impossible to capture on film.Meet now the two male leads with whom we have been gifted:--MARCIAL DI FONZO BO, as 'Martin'---an Aids victim not yet giving up on life or finding love, who instantly recognizes that love the moment he sees a blond-god of a man appear, in of all places, on the front edge of a high-dive board. 'Martin' until then had nothing to continue living for, but with this new love in his life, the impending loss he faces becomes emotionally catastrophic......for us as well. How this story prepares him for that coming loss, and how we are allowed to watch his setting up a legacy which will buoy his new lover when the loss does occur, is a touching and heart stirring tale.--Most notably, though, we are presented the beautiful JEAN-MICHEL PORTAL, as blond 'Lucas' (that man on the board), in an uncanny characterization of one who, till now, has known only heterosexual love. Yet in this story he finds himself being faced with emotions of an entirely different nature.....emotions which he invites us in to watch as they ""take him over."" It is Portal's striking performance which allows the audience to actually see the growth and realization of this new, this different kind of love. Through his eyes, his facial expressions, and his body language, he does, indeed, present a love emerging (even though initially resisted) and growing. He begins his journey by almost reluctantly ""giving up"" his female lover/companion, as he commences ""relating"" more and more to 'Martin'. The movie viewer can virtually see his internal feelings for M. developing and ""happening""......it's an experience akin to watching the ""speeded-up-on-film"" opening of a bud to blossom. Another way of saying this is, if you've heard the old expression about a person's ""being bought out of their shell,"" then, here, with Portal's performance you can actually see someone undergoing such a transformation.CHAPTER II----Wherein we are delightedly introduced to a Michelin Guide's Mother of all Mothers............and the French do even this best. Actress, Vittoria Scognamiglio's 'Rose' is a 3-Star wonder to behold. She is every gay boy's ""dream-delight"" of a parent; a someone who even rid herself of a homophobic husband so that 'Martin' could grow to be who he should be.......happily and without fear.

775134,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0000CBL9I,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[12, 14]","I have to be frank, I'm quite surprised at how well received this small French film has been by many viewers.  In no way do I wish to offend anyone--if you found something of value in this film, I'm pleased.  However, having really looked forward to ""The Man I Love,"" I recently sat down with a few friends to check out the DVD.  This story of forbidden love and AIDS is supposed to be charming and moving, but unanimously--we found it annoying and preposterous.  With a lead character so childish, so selfish, so petulant, so borderline obsessive, so disrespectful--let's just say, it's hard to root for this film as any kind of ""love story.""  Instead, I just wished someone would slap this guy around until he had some sense.OK, I know this sounds harsh--so let's get down to the facts of the matter.  ""The Man I Love"" centers on an HIV+ man named Martin.  Working at a local pool, he meets a new lifeguard named Lucas.  Lucas, while attractive, is a monosyllabic jerk in this first meeting--he orders Martin around and barely contains a real indifference and disdain for his odd coworker.  Guess what?  Martin just eats this up--he pesters Lucas on the way home and proclaims his love (within minutes of the initial meeting) for the straight and horrified man who just wants to escape this creepy stalker.  However, Martin ends up meeting Lucas's live-in girlfriend, and she is sweet, inviting, and genuinely fond of Martin--this ends up being the key to how Martin and Lucas start spending more time together.  ""Irrepressible"" Martin starts to employ ""charming,"" ""hysterical,"" and ""endearing"" tactics to win Lucas's thawing heart--and the two, who have no common ground, start to grow close as Lucas realizes there might be an attraction.  Knowing that this is both a ""love story"" and an AIDS drama, I'll leave the rest of the plot to your imagination.I have nothing against the storyline of ""The Man I Love,"" but it's not particularly unique.  I have nothing against the actors.  Lucas, his girlfriend, and Martin's mother all give solid performances--I was especially impressed with the actor who portrays Lucas.  Having to perform the most difficult role, he must convince you to believe in some of the most outlandish scenarios.  Being stalked, manipulated and molested by Martin--he still tries to sell that this is a ""love story.""  That brings us to Martin.  Oh, I get it.  We are supposed to love Martin's free spirit, but there's a reason I've used quotes on the adjectives ""irrepressible,"" ""charming,"" and ""endearing.""  That's how the movie expects us to view Martin's juvenile antics.  But his complete disregard for everyone, but himself, is an enormous problem.  Throwing dead fish in a public pool and terrorizing clients--""hysterically romantic!"" (But we're supposed to view his boss as the villain for having a problem with these things.)  He disregards Lucas's feelings constantly and is a monster to Lucas's girlfriend, someone who has specifically reached out to him in friendship.  Martin is a truly awful human being who claims he doesn't want to be pitied for being ill, but uses it to manipulate everyone when it serves his purpose.  It's offensive.As you can see, I feel passionately about this misguided movie.  Negative stereotypes abound, but again--this film has been embraced by many.  If someone who is completely selfish and mean-spirited is an ideal romantic partner for you, then check this movie out and enjoy!  For myself, however, I'll find love elsewhere.

It's been done.  Here it is done fairly well, but it isn't very fresh or interesting.  I grew tired of Martin's constant demands of Lukas (do this, do that, get away from me, etc.) and had trouble sympathizing with his occasionally nasty demeanor once the connection with Lukas was made.That said, there are some touching expressions of love between the boys, including a wonderful wedding and ""Mom,"" who steals the show.

He meets Lucas, a lifeguard and diver at the pool where he works. Lucas is straight, or so the story goes, and living with Lise. Martin begins a quest, of sorts, to get Lucas into bed, and Lucas eventually realizes that he loves Martin and it goes on from there (don't want to spoil the ending). I think there are a lot of people, including myself, who can identify with the idea of loving someone who seems completely unavailable; Martin at least has the guts to go after him.What I didn't like was the gigantic leap of feelings, from Martin to Lucas to Lucas to Martin. In the span of the first few minutes, we learn that Martin likes Lucas, a lot, but the movie gives the impression that it's a first meeting (love at first sight?). Lucas seems to struggle with his feelings for Martin but turns around and makes one gigantic leap into love. Another issue was the lack of clarity as to why Lucas loves Martin so much, besides the illness. I think the movie could have benefited from being longer so as not to obliterate a sense of realness for falling in love, especially with a character who is questioning as much as Lucas does.What I did like is that Martin is not a completely sympathetic character. So many movies portray the dying as heroes. Martin doesn't take care of himself and he uses his illness to manipulate, something that many people with terminal illnesses do (been there, done that). I also loved the cinematography; it's absolutely gorgeous.

The usual gay equals good, straight equals bad lines are drawn in the sand.  A case in point is the girlfriend of the straight man.
