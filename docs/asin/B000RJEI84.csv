The next time, was collection of stills from the Movie plus addition stills in a coffee table book. I finally caught the movie on Cinemax and had taped it. It was years later that I was able to buy a Tape and now I have the DVD. This movie was enjoyable on several levels. One, it had an element of comedy in it which kind of tempered the darknesss of the times. It had a pretty decent, although maybe a tad shallow, story. The DVD quality was very good all things considered. Unlike the others I have, A Summer in St.Tropez. Bilitis, & Premiers Desirs, this one was not through New Star. Anja Shute ( Julia ) was, in my opinion, the show stealer. She is a cutie. She was also able to show a range of emotions, which was good. Julian wanted Julia, but she wanted Charles and Charles wanted anything in skirts. The female hired help had a thing for Julian ( lucky kid ). It sounds a bit convoluted, but isn't really. Just life on the farm  I guess. There is Nudity, but not an over abundance of it and it is done tastefully. There is also some implied sex. For me, it is a fun movie that I still like to watch from time to time.",5,Good Movie and a Favorite,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",2013,1248,"['have', 'first', 'heard', 'seen', 'title', 'years', 'ago', 'Playboy', 'had', 'article', 'stills', 'movie', 'next', 'time', 'was', 'collection', 'stills', 'Movie', 'addition', 'stills', 'coffee', 'table', 'book', 'finally', 'caught', 'movie', 'Cinemax', 'had', 'taped', 'was', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'able', 'buy', 'Tape', 'now', 'have', 'DVD', 'movie', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'several', 'levels', 'One', 'had', 'element', 'comedy', 'kind', 'tempered', 'darknesss', 'times', 'had', 'pretty', 'decent', 'maybe', 'tad', 'shallow', 'story', 'DVD', 'quality', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'things', 'considered', 'others', 'have', 'Summer', 'St.Tropez', 'Bilitis', 'Premiers', 'Desirs', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'New', 'Star', 'Anja', 'Shute', 'Julia', 'was', 'opinion', 'show', 'stealer', 'cutie', 'was', 'also', 'able', 'show', 'range', 'emotions', 'was', 'good', 'Julian', 'wanted', 'Julia', 'wanted', 'Charles', 'Charles', 'wanted', 'anything', 'skirts', 'female', 'hired', 'help', 'had', 'thing', 'Julian', 'lucky', 'kid', 'bit', 'convoluted', ""n't"", 'really', 'Just', 'life', 'farm', 'guess', 'Nudity', 'not', 'abundance', 'done', 'tastefully', 'also', 'implied', 'sex', 'fun', 'movie', 'still', 'watch', 'time', 'time']",Tendres Cousines

War breaks out and all the men on the farm and the surrounding village are sent off to fight.  You find yourself surrounded by women and girls.  As the only &#34;man&#34; around, naturally, you start getting a lot of attention.  So far, this sounds like every teenage boy's fantasy, right?Too bad life is not that simple.  Sometimes, the attention you're getting is not coming from the one you want.  And the one you want, wants none of your attentions.  Our young man, Julien, is in love with his cousin.  But the cousin is in love with an older man, who went off to war.  She does not take him seriously.  That is the plot of this movie.Lots of teenage romance, some light drama, and a pretty good dose of comedy.
