864602,A3TBIP2WWK7L85,B0006A9FS2,"Erik Kramer ""ekosmo72""","[4, 6]",I enjoyed the movie and found the humor midly funny.  The only reason I didn't give five stars is because only once in the whole movie did I actually laugh.  All the rest of the attempts at comedy prompted nothing more from me than a larg smile (but they did make me smile).  Also this show is definetly not for kids under 17.  I am sure most people can tell just by the name and the picture on the cover of the DVD.If you are a collector of comedy DVDs then this will be a good but not great addition to your library.

I haven't seen the movie in three years and it took a few minutes of being on Google before I remembered the name of the movie so that I could order it. The movie didn't take long to deliver and I watched it with my brother. We laughed our butts off through every scene!It's one of those classic high-school movies. High-school loser kid who wishes he can have more meaning in his life while being surrounded by popular types and spazzing out at school about a girl who doesn't even like him at all in the first place, including one embarrassing daydream that soon has the whole class and the teacher as well laughing at him. Then he finds out the ultimate truth. His parents aren't his REAL parents, and his real parents have just died in an accident, leaving him with $80 million and the ownership of a popular porn magazine called ""Heaven"".During his rise to fame and so-called ""popularity"", the kid soon tends to forget about the friends he has and the one girl who actually does like him, focusing on the blonde skank he had a thing for in his daydreams, and who is now wanting to plan their wedding together. He turns his back on everything he once knew, and is blind to the fact that his uncle and the lawyer named Mike HUNT(say it quickly for full-laugh effects!)are trying to sabotage the coming-out of the next magazine issue in order to take the ownership out of his hands.Nevertheless, the plot succeeds and the kid is booted out as leading chairman of the magazine, finding himself back to where he started, with no money, and now no friends. And he finds out that the only way to clear his name and regain his title and millions of dollars, rest with the friends that he had ignored.
