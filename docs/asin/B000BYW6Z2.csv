However, I really overestimated my ability-- this is CRAZY YOGA! WHOA- way beyond what most of us can handle.It's interesting to see how advanced yoga can be, but I only watched it once. After that, I never had any use for it.Unless you are just curious to see really advanced stuff without the chance to be able to do it yourself, I would recommend you buying a different Rodney Yee video.",3,Interesting but not something for most of us to workout to!,1252713600,"09 12, 2009",2009,482,"['love', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'yoga', 'workouts', 'thought', 'would', 'challenge', 'ordering', 'one', 'However', 'really', 'overestimated', 'ability', 'CRAZY', 'YOGA', 'WHOA-', 'way', 'what', 'most', 'can', 'handle.It', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'advanced', 'yoga', 'can', 'be', 'only', 'watched', 'once', 'never', 'had', 'use', 'it.Unless', 'are', 'just', 'curious', 'see', 'really', 'advanced', 'stuff', 'chance', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'would', 'recommend', 'buying', 'different', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'video']",Rodney Yee - Advanced Yoga
953488,A1E7LZ9IBKK702,B000BYW6Z2,Balkiss M. Turnier,"[6, 6]","Again...i wanted to challenge myself in my yoga practice and felt i was ready so i bought myself this dvd. I cannot say anything negative about this DVD really. At first, i had some difficulty keeping up with the ""arm balance"" section because Rodney moved a little fast through it, but after that i got the hang of it (as witn any new dvd). I felt satisfied and got a great yoga workout. It really works your arm balance poses and opens up the hips, an area i still have difficulty with but i see an increase of flexibility already. Rodney is calm and very informative, specially in the breathing section. The settings are very peaceful and appeal to the eye.But...this DVD is not for beginners in any way!!! you can easely harm yourself if you are not flexible or already have at least 2-3 years of GOOD yoga experience and some arm balance poses. There are a few poses (arm balance) i still cant do so i skip those and practice additionally in my own time to strenghten and when ready ill follow the Flow completely and safely.This DVD is truely inspirational and I feel Rodney really delivers. So its worth buying if you really want to challenge yourself.",5,very advanced and challenging,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,1158,"['Again', 'i', 'wanted', 'challenge', 'yoga', 'practice', 'felt', 'i', 'was', 'ready', 'so', 'i', 'bought', 'dvd', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'negative', 'DVD', 'really', 'first', 'i', 'had', 'difficulty', 'keeping', 'up', 'arm', 'balance', 'section', 'Rodney', 'moved', 'little', 'fast', 'i', 'got', 'hang', 'witn', 'new', 'dvd', 'felt', 'satisfied', 'got', 'great', 'yoga', 'workout', 'really', 'arm', 'balance', 'poses', 'up', 'hips', 'area', 'i', 'still', 'have', 'difficulty', 'i', 'see', 'increase', 'flexibility', 'already', 'Rodney', 'calm', 'very', 'informative', 'specially', 'breathing', 'section', 'settings', 'are', 'very', 'peaceful', 'appeal', 'eye.But', 'DVD', 'not', 'beginners', 'way', 'can', 'easely', 'harm', 'are', 'not', 'flexible', 'already', 'have', 'least', '2-3', 'years', 'GOOD', 'yoga', 'experience', 'arm', 'balance', 'poses', 'are', 'few', 'poses', 'arm', 'balance', 'i', 'still', 'cant', 'do', 'so', 'i', 'skip', 'practice', 'additionally', 'own', 'time', 'strenghten', 'when', 'ready', 'ill', 'follow', 'Flow', 'completely', 'safely.This', 'DVD', 'truely', 'inspirational', 'feel', 'Rodney', 'really', 'worth', 'buying', 'really', 'want', 'challenge']",Rodney Yee - Advanced Yoga
953489,A118DD1BQQX1WX,B000BYW6Z2,James E. White,"[83, 86]","I have purchased Rodney Yee DVDs for the past five years, progressing from the basic ones, through the intermediate to this advanced DVD.  Rodney Yee has put together another great DVD.  This DVD is by no means meant for a beginner.  I would not advise any one to try the routines without three or more years of consistent yogic practice.  Otherwise, you could either hurt yourself or just wind up frustrated from not being able to keep up with the sequence(s).With the disclaimer out of the way let me tell you that this is a great DVD.  I have practiced to Rod Yee's DVD's for a long time, and this one is the best one yet.  People who are familar with Yee will find that the pace of this DVD is a bit faster than normal, so I would advise watching the DVD before following along.  He moves through the poses quickly and effortlessly.  He will stay a bit longer in really advanced poses and arm balances, but for the most part moved right through the sequence.The 1st DVD includes two sequences, an arm balancing and hip opener coming in at approximately 50 and 25 minutes respectively.  The arm balancing sequence includes alot of intermediate to advanced arm balances (e.g. a few advanced versions of headstand, crow pose, balancing while one leg is over the should and opposite  leg is extended, and a few I hope to be able to do in the next five years).  The hip opener sequence is amazing.  Normally it takes me 60 minutes of doing Ashtanga Yoga before I can even consider sitting in a full lotus, with Yee's DVD I could sit comforatably after 20 minutes of his routine.  The arm balance sequence does include a lot of the hip opening poses you will see in the hip opening sequence.  The hip opening sequence includes alot of half and full lotus based poses including rooster poses (sitting in full lotus and balancing your weight on your hands).  The breath work is a good DVD as well, but my interest is moreso in the poses than the pranayama.  Again, this is a fantastic DVD if you have the yogic background.  I cannot stress enough that if you are fairly new to yoga or you are looking to start doing yoga, then this DVD should only be used as a source of inspiration for where you hope to be in the next few years.",5,Another success for a very successful series of DVDs,1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,2226,"['have', 'purchased', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'DVDs', 'past', 'five', 'years', 'progressing', 'basic', 'ones', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'DVD', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'put', 'together', 'great', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'means', 'meant', 'beginner', 'would', 'not', 'advise', 'one', 'try', 'routines', 'three', 'more', 'years', 'consistent', 'yogic', 'practice', 'Otherwise', 'could', 'either', 'hurt', 'just', 'wind', 'up', 'frustrated', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'sequence', 'disclaimer', 'way', 'let', 'tell', 'great', 'DVD', 'have', 'practiced', 'Rod', 'Yee', 'DVD', 'long', 'time', 'one', 'best', 'one', 'yet', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'familar', 'Yee', 'will', 'find', 'pace', 'DVD', 'bit', 'faster', 'normal', 'would', 'advise', 'watching', 'DVD', 'following', 'along', 'poses', 'quickly', 'effortlessly', 'will', 'stay', 'bit', 'longer', 'really', 'advanced', 'poses', 'arm', 'balances', 'most', 'part', 'moved', 'right', 'sequence.The', '1st', 'DVD', 'two', 'sequences', 'arm', 'balancing', 'hip', 'opener', 'coming', 'approximately', '50', '25', 'minutes', 'respectively', 'arm', 'balancing', 'sequence', 'alot', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'arm', 'balances', 'e.g', 'few', 'advanced', 'versions', 'headstand', 'crow', 'pose', 'balancing', 'one', 'leg', 'should', 'opposite', 'leg', 'extended', 'few', 'hope', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'next', 'five', 'years', 'hip', 'opener', 'sequence', 'amazing', 'Normally', '60', 'minutes', 'doing', 'Ashtanga', 'Yoga', 'can', 'even', 'consider', 'sitting', 'full', 'lotus', 'Yee', 'DVD', 'could', 'sit', 'comforatably', '20', 'minutes', 'routine', 'arm', 'balance', 'sequence', 'include', 'lot', 'hip', 'opening', 'will', 'see', 'hip', 'opening', 'sequence', 'hip', 'opening', 'sequence', 'alot', 'half', 'full', 'lotus', 'based', 'poses', 'including', 'rooster', 'poses', 'sitting', 'full', 'lotus', 'balancing', 'weight', 'hands', 'breath', 'work', 'good', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'interest', 'moreso', 'poses', 'pranayama', 'Again', 'fantastic', 'DVD', 'have', 'yogic', 'background', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'are', 'fairly', 'new', 'yoga', 'are', 'looking', 'start', 'doing', 'yoga', 'then', 'DVD', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'used', 'source', 'inspiration', 'where', 'hope', 'be', 'next', 'few', 'years']",Rodney Yee - Advanced Yoga

This might make it easier for you to judge if this review is helpfull for you or not. I praktice Yoga (Power Vinyasa Yoga) since about 6 Years. &Iacute; teach Yoga at a local Hotel Spa Fitness Studio and praktice every day. Since I'm german, my english, exspecially the spelling, is far from perfect. Please excuse that.About the DVD: The Armbalance series is very advanced stuff. There are a lot of preparations like Streches and such before and between the Armbalances, but since most of the advanced Armbalances are done the classical way (Going into an headstand than moving into the Armbalance, than back to headstance (see Iyengars ""Light of Yoga"" Book to compare)it is only for very skilled and advanced people. If you can't imagine going into an headstand, than from there going into Bakasana (Crow-pose) and than back to headstand, this workout is not for you. Even though I can do all Armbalances in the Workout, I can't do them all starting from headstand and not so many in a short time. And I have to say that Armbalances are my favourite and I practise some every day. This is really very advanced stuff, but it is great for any experienced Yogi who wants to push his body and mind further to the edge.The hip-opening-routine is great! It is medicine and for everybody. The hips are so important for your Yoga practise, and they're often very tight and overlooked. The second DVD is about Pranayama. Very interesting for everybody who is interested in all the advanced meditative Aspects of Yoga. Rodny guides a student through the breathing exercises in a very professionell way.Rodny Yee is a very gentil and highly skilled Instructor. I really recommend this programm! But the armbalance workout is only for very Advanced people.By the way, the setting in the DVD is beautifull.Namast&eacute;",5,Advanced Yoga from a very competend Teacher,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,1868,"['first', 'would', 'like', 'make', 'few', 'comments', 'might', 'make', 'easier', 'judge', 'review', 'helpfull', 'not', 'praktice', 'Yoga', 'Power', 'Vinyasa', 'Yoga', '6', 'Years', 'Iacute', 'teach', 'Yoga', 'local', 'Hotel', 'Spa', 'Fitness', 'Studio', 'praktice', 'day', ""'m"", 'german', 'english', 'exspecially', 'spelling', 'far', 'perfect', 'Please', 'excuse', 'DVD', 'Armbalance', 'series', 'very', 'advanced', 'stuff', 'are', 'lot', 'preparations', 'Streches', 'such', 'Armbalances', 'most', 'advanced', 'Armbalances', 'are', 'done', 'classical', 'way', 'Going', 'headstand', 'moving', 'Armbalance', 'back', 'headstance', 'see', 'Iyengars', 'Light', 'Yoga', 'Book', 'compare', 'only', 'very', 'skilled', 'advanced', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'going', 'headstand', 'going', 'Bakasana', 'Crow-pose', 'back', 'headstand', 'workout', 'not', 'Even', 'can', 'do', 'Armbalances', 'Workout', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'starting', 'headstand', 'not', 'so', 'many', 'short', 'time', 'have', 'say', 'Armbalances', 'are', 'favourite', 'practise', 'day', 'really', 'very', 'advanced', 'stuff', 'great', 'experienced', 'Yogi', 'who', 'push', 'body', 'mind', 'further', 'edge.The', 'hip-opening-routine', 'great', 'medicine', 'everybody', 'hips', 'are', 'so', 'important', 'Yoga', 'practise', ""'re"", 'often', 'very', 'tight', 'overlooked', 'second', 'DVD', 'Pranayama', 'Very', 'interesting', 'everybody', 'who', 'interested', 'advanced', 'meditative', 'Aspects', 'Yoga', 'Rodny', 'student', 'breathing', 'very', 'professionell', 'way.Rodny', 'Yee', 'very', 'gentil', 'highly', 'skilled', 'Instructor', 'really', 'recommend', 'programm', 'armbalance', 'workout', 'only', 'very', 'Advanced', 'people.By', 'way', 'setting', 'DVD', 'beautifull.Namast', 'eacute']",Rodney Yee - Advanced Yoga
