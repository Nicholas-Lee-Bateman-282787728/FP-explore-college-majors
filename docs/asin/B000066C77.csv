I wanted to give it like 3 and a half stars because it's not quite a 4 star movie, but better than a 3 star movie.  There is a great twist in the film (which I love) but the very end was a bit predictable.  However, it didn't ruin the movie for me.  I'm not sure I would classify this as sci-fi.  It's more of a mystery/semi-thriller.  It reminded me of the old Twilight Zones a little or The Outer Limits tv show a lot.  If you are looking for spaceships, robots, high tech machines ... this movie doesn't have any of that.  But it does have some pretty good acting, an interesting plot and a winding story line that will keep you guessing til the very end.  There are a lot of bad movies out there today...

I've seen Leary miscast in so many films that it was wonderful finally seeing him in one that showed all facets of his talent.  He should not be in light, frothy romantic comedies, which he's done, and this certainly is not a light, frothy, romantic comedy. I'm not even sure he should be in gangster films and I've seen him in several of those (ok at best).  He and Hope Davis are great together here and come together better as a couple than he has come together with any other actress in a film. I've seen him in romance vehicles with other actresses, like Sandra Bullock, that were just dismal.  He needs to do biting satire like he did in ""The Ref"" or outright layered, nuanced drama, like he does here. (I also loved his standup comedy act.)  Leary's character, Bill, wakes up from a coma in a psychiatric hospital with delusions that he is about to be executed by some futuristic society which has unfrozen him from the past.  However, under Hope Davis's care as Ann, his psychiatrist, he starts remembering trauma from his pre-coma life, including the death of his father, a break up with his fiance, and a drunken binge while driving. He starts to recover from his mental breakdown yet his delusions don't entirely disappear, surprisingly enough.  Or are they delusions?  Great blues music throughout.  I'd heard nothing about this film and tried it out simply based on what I read on the box and Leary's, Scott's and Davis's involvement.  I wasn't expecting a perfect 10 of a film but I sure got it!

This has been going on since 2007. Last week I viewed Dennis & Hope in ""The Secret Lives of Dentists"" & though I must not be patient enough to enjoy a possibly unique film and that was exactly the problem. As I watched the film I noticed that I was being enveloped by the plot. There were not the traditional protagonist and antagonist but a incredible love story with superb dialog and acting. The film kept getting better as I watched it and I was floored. Sure there were minute pieces that could have been tweaked. One hallway shot after the deaths & Dennis could have taken a few guitar lessons a la Ralph Macchio Crossroads But aside from being pedantic I love this film and it just reaffirms a philosophy that I try to incorporate into my life-Have patience with art, especially film with actors that love. The most important analogy especially for this film is captured in a performance from a musical perspective. Would you rather hear a band start off a tune with explosive energy and see them slowly fall apart that by the end the crowd is disgusted or a a band start a tune sloppy and disjointed but slowly work to get the timing, energy and cohesiveness that ends in a triumphant climax?

That movie showed a man descending into paranoia-- believing everyone is out to get him and conspiring against him for some type of experiment. This one also has a hero in a similar situation. However, here, there is doubt as to whom to believe.Denis Leary is great in this role and the movie is interesting, although it's not a perfect film by any means.He wakes up one morning in a mental hospital believing it is 400 years in the future. He believes he went into the hospital to do a cryogenic experiment on his finger 400 years ago and that he was put into a cryogenic sleep against his will. He believes that he overhears the hospital staff talking about giving him his ""final"" injection that will kill him.He tries to enlist the aid of his doctor (played without emotion by Hope Davis) who he begins to trust. As he begins to trust her, he starts doubting his own beliefs.This movie has a great premise and almost delivers in its execution. Actually, it does, but it's not too satisfying.

And make no mistake, this IS science fiction.  Once the basic premise is revealed, it is crystal clear that what is really going on here challenges the main character and the viewer as well in their moral priorities.The main character, Tyler, is played by Dennis Leary, who turns in a solid performance as someone whose paranoid fantasies of his current situation, ostensibly in said mental institution, fuse with his memories of a lost love from years before.  His doctor is Hope Davis, here proving her versatility as, at first, a removed scientist, then gradually warming to her subject.The doctor's sister is also a patient, but one confined because of a physical illness, not for reasons of mental deterioration. This is a key element in the puzzle of this film as it unravels, as is the ice-cold director of the institution and the complete geographical isolation of the institution itself.As Tyler's memories become clearer, he simultaneously moves closer to the doctor emotionally.  This very intelligent plot device is critical in the development of the story.  The beginning is a bit slow, because of what, as mentioned, appears to be a fairly routine scenario.
