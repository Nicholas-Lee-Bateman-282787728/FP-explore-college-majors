One of my  favorite episodes in this set is titled ""Buttons and Beaux"" and the focus in this episode is  on Lizette, who I always liked.The only  thing about  season  2 is, it was a short season  with just  13 episodes and, its really  sad that  they had cancelled the series.This set consists of 4 discs, with the first  3 discs having 4 episodes each  while the 4th  disc has just  one episode.I must  let you know that  the picture  quality  for season  2 is  as super as the first  season  and,  it truly  looks as if they were  made today, its that  good!!",5,Excellent second season!!,1107129600,"01 31, 2005",2005,705,"['second', 'season', 'as', 'wonderful', 'first', 'season', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'excellent', 'so', 'charming', 'series', 'One', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'set', 'titled', 'Buttons', 'Beaux', 'focus', 'episode', 'Lizette', 'who', 'always', 'liked.The', 'only', 'thing', 'season', '2', 'was', 'short', 'season', 'just', '13', 'episodes', 'really', 'sad', 'had', 'cancelled', 'series.This', 'set', '4', 'discs', 'first', '3', 'discs', 'having', '4', 'episodes', '4th', 'disc', 'just', 'one', 'episode.I', 'must', 'let', 'know', 'picture', 'quality', 'season', '2', 'as', 'super', 'first', 'season', 'truly', 'were', 'made', 'today', 'good']",N/A

I enjoy these shows as you can watch them with anyone. Highly reccommended if you like family style entertainment. The orphans are cute and play their parts well.,5,Michael Landon Scores Again !,1361404800,"02 21, 2013",2013,249,"['Season', 'two', 'Father', 'Murphy', 'story', 'orphans', 'coping', 'frontier', 'enjoy', 'shows', 'can', 'watch', 'anyone', 'Highly', 'reccommended', 'like', 'family', 'style', 'entertainment', 'orphans', 'are', 'cute', 'play', 'parts', 'well']",N/A
