1514210,A304GUEPCPYM3Z,B006BZ6YMQ,"citan-uzuki ""citan-uzuki""","[6, 8]","Braquo is the story of a group of Paris police officers caught up in an escalating web of coverups and corruption.  Max, Eddy, Theo, Walter, and Roxanne are elite members of the police force.  They operate in that area where the lines between the police and the criminals are sometimes murky.  Unlike what we would call a ""Vice Squad"" here in the U.S., this small group of plainclothes officers deal with crimes from prostitution all the way to homicide.  Their methods, some of which bend the law itself, are very effective.  They are good at what they do.  And they get the job done, that others could not.  As such, they are the tools that are not appreciated, or acknowledged, but are considered to be necessary for the fight against crime.  They're tough, street-smart, and dedicated.The story starts off with Max interrogating a rape suspect.  Unable to get a confession out of the suspect, Max loses his temper and stabs the suspect in the eye.  The suspect, Bennaissa, is taken to the hospital, Max is taken into custody.  Internal Affairs proceeds with an inquiry into Max's conduct and history.  Dismissal seems inevitable.  Which would mean losing his pension.  During the inquiry, Max commits suicide.  Max was dismissed from service, posthumously.  Because of the circumstances, Max's family are denied his pension.  His squad reasoned out that if they could make Bennaissa recant his testimony and retract his charges, Max would be reinstated posthumously, and the family would become eligible for pension.  They then formulate a plan to sneak Bennaissa, the rape suspect, out of police custody and convince him to recant his testimony against Max.  Wearing masks and armed with shotguns, they sneak into the hospital and kidnap Bennaissa.  The plan was to scare him into agreeing to take back his testimony against Max, and then return him back to the hospital.  They take him to a vacant area outside of the city limits and proceeds to try to intimidate him into retracting his statements, as well as naming his accomplices in the rape.  Just as before, Bennaissa proves to be stubborn and refuses to cooperate.  Theo, high on drugs, loses his temper and shoots the suspect in the head.  Now, the group will have to find a way to coverup the mess.With an equally corrupt Internal Affairs officer hot on their trail, it is all the four could do to stay one step ahead.  This is a story where all of the characters are grey and suitably complex.  Those who enjoy HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" will enjoy this French import.  Needless to say, this is for mature audiences only.  Highly recommended.",4,Adrenalline Rush,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,2605,"['Braquo', 'story', 'group', 'Paris', 'police', 'officers', 'caught', 'up', 'escalating', 'web', 'coverups', 'corruption', 'Max', 'Eddy', 'Theo', 'Walter', 'Roxanne', 'are', 'elite', 'members', 'police', 'force', 'operate', 'area', 'where', 'lines', 'police', 'criminals', 'are', 'sometimes', 'murky', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'Vice', 'Squad', 'here', 'U.S.', 'small', 'group', 'plainclothes', 'officers', 'deal', 'crimes', 'prostitution', 'way', 'homicide', 'methods', 'bend', 'law', 'are', 'very', 'effective', 'are', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'others', 'could', 'not', 'such', 'are', 'tools', 'are', 'not', 'appreciated', 'acknowledged', 'are', 'considered', 'be', 'necessary', 'fight', 'crime', ""'re"", 'tough', 'street-smart', 'dedicated.The', 'story', 'Max', 'interrogating', 'rape', 'suspect', 'Unable', 'get', 'confession', 'suspect', 'Max', 'temper', 'stabs', 'suspect', 'eye', 'suspect', 'Bennaissa', 'taken', 'hospital', 'Max', 'taken', 'custody', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'proceeds', 'inquiry', 'Max', 'conduct', 'history', 'Dismissal', 'inevitable', 'would', 'mean', 'losing', 'pension', 'inquiry', 'Max', 'suicide', 'Max', 'was', 'dismissed', 'service', 'posthumously', 'circumstances', 'Max', 'family', 'are', 'denied', 'pension', 'squad', 'reasoned', 'out', 'could', 'make', 'Bennaissa', 'recant', 'testimony', 'retract', 'charges', 'Max', 'would', 'be', 'reinstated', 'posthumously', 'family', 'would', 'become', 'eligible', 'pension', 'then', 'formulate', 'plan', 'sneak', 'Bennaissa', 'rape', 'suspect', 'police', 'custody', 'convince', 'recant', 'testimony', 'Max', 'Wearing', 'masks', 'armed', 'shotguns', 'sneak', 'hospital', 'kidnap', 'Bennaissa', 'plan', 'was', 'scare', 'agreeing', 'take', 'back', 'testimony', 'Max', 'then', 'return', 'back', 'hospital', 'take', 'vacant', 'area', 'city', 'limits', 'proceeds', 'try', 'intimidate', 'retracting', 'statements', 'as', 'well', 'naming', 'accomplices', 'rape', 'Just', 'before', 'Bennaissa', 'be', 'stubborn', 'cooperate', 'Theo', 'high', 'drugs', 'temper', 'shoots', 'suspect', 'head', 'Now', 'group', 'will', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'coverup', 'mess.With', 'equally', 'corrupt', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'officer', 'hot', 'trail', 'four', 'could', 'do', 'stay', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'story', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'grey', 'suitably', 'complex', 'who', 'enjoy', 'HBO', 'Game', 'Thrones', 'will', 'enjoy', 'French', 'import', 'Needless', 'say', 'mature', 'audiences', 'only', 'Highly', 'recommended']","Braquo - Complete Season 1 Set Braquo - Complete Season One  NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 United Kingdom"

Now I can watch discs from France, Denmark, Australia with no problem. ( I bought it new on eBay). So, this is a series about a squad of French detectives who are under cover, or at least plain clothes. They get in trouble with both the underworld criminals and the spineless police brass-no doubt a universal problem. The series follows them through 3 years, but I have only watched 2. Year 3 is $60 plus dollars, and I am just not that ready to part with that much money yet. I do recommend the series.

1514214,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B006BZ6YMQ,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","Prior to viewing the French cop drama ""Braquo,"" I had heard it frequently compared to HBO's ""The Wire."" While this sets up certain expectations, I don't particularly feel that the comparison is apt. If anything, ""Braquo"" reminded me more of the FX's ""The Shield."" But I don't want to trivialize this terrifically bold and gritty series by suggesting it's a knock-off of an American counterpart. For this dark program is undeniably French and I mean that as a compliment! It plays with a lot of familiar concepts and cop conventions. For example, there is an elite (but somewhat rogue) band of police officers willing to color outside the lines of propriety to achieve results. While this may be the oldest plot line in the book, it stills feels remarkably fresh in ""Braquo."" The series in unrelentingly dark, intensely brutal at times, and as twisty as you'd want any tale to be. The action sequences are well orchestrated and the plot threads are surprisingly well written. Created by a former cop, Olivier Marchal, the story can feel both outlandish and true-to-life and that's a hard tone to maintain. Due to this, though, the series has a certain unpredictable quality and things may not always end up as you anticipate.Season One (from 2009) and Season Two (from 2011) both got a North American DVD distribution and, having picked up both sets, I have found this a new binge-watching pleasure. I haven't enjoyed a series so much since I discovered ""Spiral"" (also from France). Both Seasons have 8 episodes stretched over 3 discs with each episode running approximately 46 minutes. There are no bonus features. And if you've gotten this far, I hope I don't have to mention that the series is in French with English subtitles.Season One: The series kicks off with a killer plot line and establishes its violent tone quite quickly. The show is not for particularly sensitive viewers! Accused of malfeasance, a Parisian officer commits suicide in the premiere. His faithful squad mates (and best friends) seek to avenge his death and bring about justice at any cost. Jean-Hugues Anglade (a favorite of mine since Besson's great ""La Femme Nikita"") plays the squad's leader and is a pretty typical antihero. He can be both admirable and unhinged by equal measures. He seems somewhat chilly to his friend's widow, but undeniably committed to uncovering the truth. Another standout in the cast is Karole Rocher as the requisite tough chick. And the foursome is rounded out by wildcard Nicolas Duvauchelle and the unexpectedly sensitive Joseph Malerba. Pitted against a villain with a supremely obnoxious haircut (Geoffroy Thiebaut as Roland Vogel), there seems to be only three outcomes available. Their antics could lead to justice, death, or imprisonment.Season Two: With everything that transpired in Season One, it's no wonder that Internal Affairs has gotten closer and more interested in our rogue band of cops. The freedom that they've experienced seems to be at an end. Anglade, in an effort to protect his team, makes a startling decision that all but disbands the unit. With everyone going a separate way, it takes a crisis to reunite the friends (even if it is outside the justice system). This time, our guys are completely on their own with both the police and the bad guys looking to take them out. While I did appreciate the new direction for Season Two (and it is exciting), it is also somewhat less real feeling. This may bother some, but I was more than compensated by the sheer entertainment value provided.If you like International programming and/or gritty crime drama, ""Braquo"" is definitely a series worth checking out. (And while I'm at it, I'll give another shout-out to Spiral as well).
