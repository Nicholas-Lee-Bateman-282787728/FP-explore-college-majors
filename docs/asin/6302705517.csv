He expects it to be hell,  but instead he faces his own demons and learns about the importance of  teamwork and what REALLY makes a winner.

Fact or fiction, as a movie it found a large enough audience to convince Disney Studios to follow-up with two more installments of Mighty Duck Mania.Plot: Self-absorbed young lawyer, Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) is sentenced to community service for a traffic violation. His assignment is to fill in as the interim hockey coach for a local group of underachieving kids. Coach Bombay, a former hocky star in the same league years earlier, has inherited the worst team in the league. Can he harness their rebellious attitudes and turn them into contenders? Maybe even make them good enough to challenge the perennial champions and his old coach?Formulamatic but lots of fun anyway. Estevez is surrounded by a strong cast with: Lane Smith as Coach Reilly, Heidi Kling as Casey Conway, Joshua Jackson as Charlie Conway and Marguette Moreau as Connie.",5,"""You Quacked At Your Teacher  ~  Ducks Fly Together!""",1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,981,"['Mighty', 'Ducks', 'released', ""'92"", 'probably', 'only', 'film', 'can', 'boast', 'theatrical', 'success', 'launched', 'sports', 'franchise', 'Fact', 'fiction', 'movie', 'found', 'large', 'enough', 'audience', 'convince', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'follow-up', 'two', 'more', 'installments', 'Mighty', 'Duck', 'Mania.Plot', 'Self-absorbed', 'young', 'lawyer', 'Gordon', 'Bombay', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'sentenced', 'community', 'service', 'traffic', 'violation', 'assignment', 'fill', 'interim', 'hockey', 'coach', 'local', 'group', 'underachieving', 'kids', 'Coach', 'Bombay', 'former', 'hocky', 'star', 'same', 'league', 'years', 'earlier', 'inherited', 'worst', 'team', 'league', 'Can', 'harness', 'rebellious', 'attitudes', 'turn', 'contenders', 'Maybe', 'even', 'make', 'good', 'enough', 'challenge', 'perennial', 'champions', 'old', 'coach', 'Formulamatic', 'lots', 'fun', 'anyway', 'Estevez', 'surrounded', 'strong', 'cast', 'Lane', 'Smith', 'Coach', 'Reilly', 'Heidi', 'Kling', 'Casey', 'Conway', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'Charlie', 'Conway', 'Marguette', 'Moreau', 'Connie']",N/A

328436,A3BJHQSDEPOPTJ,6302705517,Dan Reef,"[2, 2]","A very enjoyable and coming-of-age hockey story about persistance, drive and a will to win. It does involve a bunch of losers who turn into a bunch of winners, but it is done the right way: with entertaining flashbacks of past successes and failures, complemented by hard work and kids having fun where hockey is the topic of conversation, 24 hours a day. In my opinion, it is the roughest and most talent demanding sport in today's society, but also the least publicized and most enjoyable. A group of kids can do something right if they really want to and are willing to give it 110. Not only is this fun to watch, it sends a positive message out to all.

328442,A25RN8X70DSZLU,6302705517,JRP,"[0, 0]","now before I review D2 for my next 20 years ago review I thought I'd review the 1st movie since I have it in a double feature as well I do have Mighty Ducks 3 on VHS which I won't go & watch it right away I remember not liking it plus I can wait 2 years for that 20 years ago review. The Mighty Ducks came out in October of 1992 made for $10 million made $6 million it's opening weekend & made $50 million in it's full US run. Directed by Stephen Herek he has directed Critters & Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure so he has credibility going in. It stars Emilio Estevez as Gordon Bombay, Lane Smith as Coach Jack Riley, Joss Ackland as Hans, Josef Sommer as Mr Ducksworth, Joshua Jackson as Charlie Conway, Shaun Weiss as Goldberg, Elden Henson as Fulton Reed, Matt Doherty as Les Averman & Vincent Larusso as Adam Banks. Story is about this man named Gordon Bombay who as a kid played Hockey for The Hawks who had a perfect record in little league Hockey so he was in The State Championship Game where he missed a penalty shot costing him the game his Coach never forgave him cause he took the game too seriously he quit Hockey he never even watched a game on TV. As an adult he works as a Lawyer & claims he hasn't lost a case even though he did lose he said he still won cause he scored with a Court Reporter. He goes out & gets drunk but is pulled over for being under the influence. He ends up having his license suspended he has to take a leave of absence from The Law Firm. So he has to do some Community Service he has to Coach a little league hockey team called The District 5 are a basic underdog team but a likable group main players are Charlie, Goldberg, Averman, Jesse, Terry & Connie. He shows up at practice on this frozen pond & he really doesn't want to do this the kids think this man is up to no good Bombay says sarcastically ""This is going to be a real bonding experience maybe 1 day 1 of you will write a book about it in jail."" He tells them to show off their skills & it's just bad. You also have this character named Averman goofing off he's the comic relief but he's not annoying he's actually funny unlike in part 2. He's just standing there saying ""The Pete miester. Mr Rabble Rouser. Passing the puck over to Jesse roonie the enforcer.""  Connie comes through Averman says ""It's The Connie meister."" She knocks him down. Averman says ""The Velvet Hammer."" While Gordon is in The Limo taking care of a little business you have the team all get in The Limo & they want a ride. They run into Charlie's Mom who is upset at Bombay that he had her Son in a Limo over a frozen pond. So you get to Bombay's 1st game Coaching District 5 & it's against The Hawks still being Coached by Jack Riley he does a good job making you not like him from the get go cause there's these different banner's on the wall showing the different years The Hawks won State Championships & on 1973 it says 2nd Place & Riley says I wish they would get rid of don't you. He is still holding a grudge after 20 years which is believable. I mean I have seen grown adults act like 6 year olds. Remember that BS 10 years ago in Chicago wanting to kill that Man for catching a foul ball people are still filled with rage over it today. You know I've heard stories how embarrassing parents are at little league ball games.  You also see Riley's big player Adam Banks. So District 5 plays The Hawks & it's a disaster they look low rent cause they can't afford real Hockey Equipment. Their play looks low rent cause Coach Riley has his team play like it's life or death & they use cheating tactics. Averman says during this game ""Um batter, batter, batter, batter, batter! Hey batter batter swing batter, batter!"" Bombay tells him it's Hockey there's no batter idiot! Averman:""Hum goalie goalie hum goalie goalie!"" This game is brutal for District 5 The Goalie Goldberg is sick of being knocked down so he he stands by the goal & says ""Just take the goal. Fine I don't care!"" Bombay chews the team out. Bombay sees an old Family Friend Hans at the rink. A group of Hawk Players jump the team in an alley but are saved by this loner kid named Fulton Reed. The next game they play is against The Jets & yet again it's a disaster & Bombay tells Charlie to cheat which he doesn't want to he does want to play by the rules. You have parents upset at Bombay they want to pull their kids out until a new Coach comes in. He talks to Hans who gives them a pair of Skates he tells him to show the kids how to have fun & work as 1. Bombay apologizes to Charlie & his Mom. Bombay goes to Mr Ducksowrth to become a sponser. Bombay gets more members on the team they get real gear Bombay gets them to play better. 1 day that Fulton kid hits a puck where it hits the van Bombay is in shattering the glass so he recruits him & they teach him how to skate. The team become The Ducks & the team doesn't like it at 1st Bombay tells them it's perfect cause Ducks stick together & from there they become a winning team. Then thanks to Hans he learns that the district lines have been redrawn he finds out Adam Banks lives in District 5 he tries to get him on the team which pi  *  *  es Coach Riley off they get in an heated argument 2 of the kids overhear it Riley calls his team a bunch of losers which Bombay being sarcastic says yeah they're a bunch of losers Riley thinks that Bombay backstabbed him he says he could've been 1 of the greats he tells him he was never was. Those 2 kids that overheard what Coach Bombay said they tell the team what he said they walk off. So he has to forfit the game. Eventually the team comes together after getting in a fight at School & they start a Quack Chant. Bombay has learned he can come back to The Firm. Mr Ducksworth has worked out a deal with Coach Riley & Adam's Father for Adam to stay on The Hawks for the rest of the season. Bombay is fired cause he still wants to keep Adam on the team. He then starts doing quack chant in Mr Ducksworth's office. He was channeling temporary insanity almost 20 years before his younger brother. He also tells his boss ""That you may have paid for this jersey sir but you didn't earn it."" He then tells Coach Riley ""I'll see you at the playoffs."" Bombay talks to the team & irons out any misunderstandings. A lot of the team mates don't know if they can trust Banks being for The Hawks. The Ducks get to The Championship game Bombay gets a offer to play Minor League Hockey. You get to The Championship game where Riley does everything to win he has Banks taken out he his his players knock him down & he fly's shoulder 1st into the goal post 1 of the kids is a real a  *  * hole & he's proud of it. Anyway Banks did manage to score a goal. Bombay has words for Coach Riley ""To think I wasted all those years worrying about what you thought. You're going down Riley."" Bombay works out some plays & The Ducks catch up with The Hawks. You have these 2 twins Tommy & Tammy on The Ducks who outsmart The Hawks so they can get another point. This a*****e knocks Tommy down Fulton goes off he throws that player over a bench. 1 thing leads to another it's tied it's down to a penalty shot Bombay tells Charlie to go for that Triple Deke he taught him he tells him do his best if he doesn't make it hey we made it this far. So Charlie goes for it & wins The Championship for the team. Hans tells Bombay he's proud of him. Hans meant more to Bombay than Coach Riley cause he actually cared about him like a Son Riley just used him & uses all his players. Coach Bombay beat the man that haunted him for 20 years & found his love of Hockey again. So at the end Bombay is going off to play Minor League Hockey his team gives him words of encouragement. Bombay tells them before he leaves that no matter what happens next season we got a title to defend. As the credits roll I just can't help but smile. Mighty Ducks still holds up for me. Still awesome 22 years later. You have likable characters & sort of a redemption story with Bombay. The music isn't too bad the score by David Neuman is very good. Stephen Herek did a great job directing. Emilio Estevez was really good. Joss Ackland did a very good job. Lane Smith is very good as the villain type character. Josef Sommer was good. Joshua Jackson did a good job. Shaun Weiss was good. Matt Doherty was good. Elden Henson did a pretty good job. Vincent Larusso was decent. Now if you didn't grow up with this movie or you're not of a younger audience then you may not like this like I do I hadn't seen this movie since sometime in the mid to late 90's. So basically if you grew up in the 90's & saw this movie a lot or have a family then I'd recommend it.

Now thirty, he's a lawyer who doesn't know anything about fair play or teamwork. When he gets arrested for drunken driving, he has to perform community service. And not just any community service, he has to coach hockey to kids! His team consists of Charlie Conway (Joshua Jackson), Greg Goldberg (Shaun Weiss), Dave Averman (Matt Doherty), Peter (J.D. Daniels), Gee Germaine (Garette Ratliff Henson), Jesse Hall (Brandon Quintin Adams), Connie Moreau (Marguerite Moreau), Dave Karp (Aaron Schwartz), and Terry Hall (Jussie Smollett). And they are an AWFUL team! Bombay hates the kids and doesn't try hard to coach them, and so of course the kids don't respect or like him at all. Will they ever be able to work as a team with Coach Bombay acting like the good coach he should be? And will they have enough time to make it to the finals against unbeatable team, Hawks? Also starring is Hans (Joss Ackland), Mr. Ducksworth (Josef Sommer), Fulton Reed (Elden Henson), Tammy (Jane Plank), and Tommy (Danny Tamberelli), Coach Reilly (Lane Smith), and Adam Banks (Vincent Larusso).Great movie entertainment! I just love the whole Mighty Ducks trilogy! They teach great values about trust, teamwork, fair play, and as Coach Bombay used to say, 'all that other junk'. It's also very, VERY hilarious! Some parts you can just die laughing, for example when the kids get in trouble from the principal and are put under detention. The hockey games are pretty suspenseful and fun, too!But there is a reason for the PG rating for this movie. Mostly it's because of language which at times is pretty bad. Also the kids in the movie are pretty naughty at times. I think the movie is best aimed for kids maybe 10 and up, great for adults, too.Then of course there are the other two ""Mighty Ducks"" films. ""D2: The Mighty Ducks"" have Bombay again coaching the Ducks, this time there are going up against the world as Team USA! Some of the hockey players aren't in this movie, but they get some new teammates. In my opinion (though it's a very hard choice), this movie is the best of all three. ""D3: The Mighty Ducks"" has the Ducks getting a scholarship for Eden Hall academy. Their main adversary are the Warriors, the varsity team of Eden Hall.

Emilio Estevez plays a hotshot, wise-cracking lawyer named Gordon Bombay. Bombay hates hockey and kids, even though he used to play hockey as a kid (that's one of the reasons why he hates both hockey and kids). When Bombay gets busted by the cops for drunk-driving, he has to be suspended from his career and do community service - particularly by coaching the &quot;District 5&quot; PeWee hockey team in Minnisota, where he lives.Bombay first thinks the job of coaching the kids will be easy...since he thinks he knows all about hockey. But when he first meets the kids, he realizes that it's going to be a lot harder than he thought - the kids are wise-cracking, rough, street kids like him who are absolutely HORRIBLE at hockey! The kids all hate him; he hates them, too. And they can't win any games. But then, he learns how to be a good coach and the kids begin to like him. Of course, you'll probably guess who will win the big play off championships - their rivals happen to be the team that Bombay played on as a kid and their coach was Bombay's old coach.Even though the plot is pretty predictable, it's still an awesome movie. And the plot is, in some way, different and unique than many others like it. The movie has a lot of hilarious parts in it. This is the kind of flick you can watch over and over again and never get bored of it. It's a great movie and another winner for Disney!

Truth be told, the one sport I've never really gotten into is hockey.  No, I loved this movie because it was a guaranteed feel-good movie.  The plucky rag-tag team of miscreants playing ice hockey coached by a man forced to do it as pennance.  For anyone that's ever watched a Disney sports movie, what follows is no surprise.  There's the requisite musical montage.  There's the team losing, and then eventually coming together to win.  There's the setback just before the end.  And then there's their ultimate triumph.I mean, really, what's not to love.  It's a simple enjoyable story, one that everyone can respond to.  Everyone sees themselves as the underdog in their own story, and everyone wants to eventually emerge victorious.  Maybe there are no big surprises in the movie but I'm cool with allowing Shamaylan to provide me shock and awe climaxes.  Disney movies are the cinematic version of a mug of hot cocoa on a snowy day - comfort food for the eyes and the mind.And besides, it's fun to watch Pacey before he fights with Dawson for Joey's love.",5,"I love this movie.

I played different sports when I was younger, but this movie made me wish I played hockey!  It's a great kids film; no sex, no real violence (it's hockey...), hardly any swearing, BUT very funny.  I haven't been delighted like this since... Since...  The Bad News Bears!The plot is pretty basic.  An ex-hockey player turned hot-shot lawyer is forced to coach a losing hockey team made up of misfits.  AFter some personality changes in the coach, he finds that hockey is still his thing and that he wishes to bring them to victory.It's full of fun moments and you get to see a young Joshua Jackson before his Dawson Creek days or his appearance in Urban Legends!  And I hate to admit this, but Emilio Estevez does a decent job.  I think most of us are used to seeing Estevez as Billy the Kid in Young Guns and it's hard to imagine him in any other role.  Especially a parental role!This movie is a stepping stone for the next two that appear (But not on DVD?!?!).  The next one is even more exciting (MIghty Ducks2-D2) with new players and a very cool storyline.  By the 3rd movie, it's hard to believe they are high school and not college and you also get to see them grow up a bit.The Mighty Ducks trilogy is a great set of films and not quite as mindless as the rest of the Disney fare available.",5,&quot;Cuz Ducks fly together!!!&quot;,996019200,"07 25, 2001",2001,1367,"[""'m"", 'little', 'old', 'kiddie', 'movies', 'yet', 'movie', 'was', 'sooooo', 'cool', 'played', 'different', 'sports', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'movie', 'made', 'wish', 'played', 'hockey', 'great', 'kids', 'film', 'sex', 'real', 'violence', 'hockey', 'hardly', 'swearing', 'BUT', 'very', 'funny', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'delighted', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'plot', 'pretty', 'basic', 'ex-hockey', 'player', 'turned', 'hot-shot', 'lawyer', 'forced', 'coach', 'losing', 'hockey', 'team', 'made', 'misfits', 'AFter', 'personality', 'changes', 'coach', 'hockey', 'still', 'thing', 'bring', 'victory.It', 'full', 'fun', 'moments', 'get', 'see', 'young', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'days', 'appearance', 'Urban', 'Legends', 'hate', 'admit', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'decent', 'job', 'think', 'most', 'are', 'used', 'seeing', 'Estevez', 'Billy', 'Kid', 'Young', 'Guns', 'hard', 'imagine', 'other', 'role', 'Especially', 'parental', 'role', 'movie', 'stepping', 'stone', 'next', 'two', 'appear', 'not', 'DVD', 'next', 'one', 'even', 'more', 'exciting', 'MIghty', 'Ducks2-D2', 'new', 'players', 'very', 'cool', 'storyline', '3rd', 'movie', 'hard', 'believe', 'are', 'high', 'school', 'not', 'college', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'grow', 'up', 'bit.The', 'Mighty', 'Ducks', 'trilogy', 'great', 'set', 'films', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'mindless', 'rest', 'Disney', 'fare', 'available']",N/A

While at first, Bombay is hesitant to give even a modicum of effort towards the cause, he gains inspiration (whether positive or negative) from old-time mentor Hans (Joss Ackland), former coach Jack Reilly (Lane Smith), and bright-eyed youngster Charlie Conway (Joshua Jackson).This is a pretty straightforward kids flick.  It has the requisite goofy humor, sometimes cringe-worthy dialogue, and a heavy amount of rah-rah drama.  Even if your kids aren't necessarily into hockey, they will like this type of movie.The reason why this movie transcends kiddie fare, though, is because it captures the essence of hockey.  It treats the sport with a great deal of respect and reverence, which taps into the nostalgia of adults watching.  Just like how &#34;Little Big League&#34; just &#34;gets&#34; baseball humor, &#34;Mighty Ducks&#34; does the exact same thing as hockey.Basically, you can't go wrong with this on family movie night.  It has enough of everything to not bore any member of the family tears.
