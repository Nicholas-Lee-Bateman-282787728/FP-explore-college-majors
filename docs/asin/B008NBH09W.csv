1571602,A2582KMXLK2P06,B008NBH09W,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Considering many films on the Lifetime Movie Network fall short of excellence in several categories, it's almost a minor miracle that Betrayed At 17 manages to escape the mediocrity that many films fall victim to and actually ends up being pretty suspenseful with a few twists and turns in the plot development that make the second half drastically different from the first.It's about a 17-year old boy who encourages a 17-year old cute and reluctant girl to have sex with him as part of a bet with a friend.  He films the act of sex using his laptop after luring the girl to his bedroom, and when he finally goes through with it he sends the video to his friend intended initially for a few cheap laughs.  However he never would have guessed the entire school would find out about it.When the girl is eventually killed in a freak accident during really awful circumstances, well, from here it's all about pointing fingers at each other over who's really responsible for not only the sex act recorded on a computer, but which person actually led to the girls death.  You're probably thinking ""Obviously the boy is completely responsible since he's the one who used her for sex!"" but there's this sassy know-it-all type blonde at the school who also plays a significant role given her rather unpleasant tone towards the girl who dies.  You'll STRONGLY hate this girl, guaranteed!I guess for the most part these characters are pretty good, but I really feel that the mother displays inaccurate emotions more often than not.  She seems unnaturally quick to stop crying over her daughter's death and begin feeling indifferent and angry due to her determination to find out how her daughter really died.  It's somewhat strange since she *should* still be sad.  The son/brothers emotions are more believable since he has a drug problem and an obvious ""I don't care about a whole lot"" attitude the entire time.  His reaction towards his sister's death is more reasonable I think, as well as his honest and angry response towards the boyfriend responsible for video taping the act of sex.  Also strange is how the brother handles the cop at the police station demandingly better than his mom while she sits around and lets her son call the shots.Overall, well this isn't as forgettable a movie as you're probably guessing.  The second half really delivers.  I just feel so bad for the girl who dies.  She was *tremendously* sweet and was just at the wrong place and the wrong time.  You really feel for her character.",4,worth your time,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,2509,"['Considering', 'many', 'films', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', 'fall', 'short', 'excellence', 'several', 'categories', 'almost', 'minor', 'miracle', 'Betrayed', '17', 'manages', 'escape', 'mediocrity', 'many', 'films', 'fall', 'victim', 'actually', 'up', 'being', 'pretty', 'suspenseful', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'plot', 'development', 'make', 'second', 'half', 'drastically', 'different', 'first.It', '17-year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', '17-year', 'old', 'cute', 'reluctant', 'girl', 'have', 'sex', 'part', 'bet', 'friend', 'films', 'act', 'sex', 'using', 'laptop', 'luring', 'girl', 'bedroom', 'when', 'finally', 'video', 'friend', 'intended', 'initially', 'few', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'However', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'entire', 'school', 'would', 'find', 'out', 'it.When', 'girl', 'eventually', 'killed', 'freak', 'accident', 'really', 'awful', 'circumstances', 'well', 'here', 'pointing', 'fingers', 'other', 'who', 'really', 'responsible', 'not', 'only', 'sex', 'act', 'recorded', 'computer', 'person', 'actually', 'led', 'girls', 'death', ""'re"", 'probably', 'thinking', 'Obviously', 'boy', 'completely', 'responsible', 'one', 'who', 'used', 'sex', 'sassy', 'know-it-all', 'type', 'blonde', 'school', 'who', 'also', 'significant', 'role', 'given', 'rather', 'unpleasant', 'tone', 'girl', 'who', ""'ll"", 'STRONGLY', 'hate', 'girl', 'guaranteed', 'guess', 'most', 'part', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'really', 'feel', 'mother', 'displays', 'inaccurate', 'emotions', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'unnaturally', 'quick', 'stop', 'crying', 'daughter', 'death', 'begin', 'feeling', 'indifferent', 'angry', 'due', 'determination', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'daughter', 'really', 'died', 'somewhat', 'strange', 'still', 'be', 'sad', 'son/brothers', 'emotions', 'are', 'more', 'believable', 'drug', 'problem', 'obvious', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'whole', 'lot', 'attitude', 'entire', 'time', 'reaction', 'sister', 'death', 'more', 'reasonable', 'think', 'as', 'well', 'honest', 'angry', 'response', 'boyfriend', 'responsible', 'video', 'taping', 'act', 'sex', 'Also', 'strange', 'how', 'brother', 'cop', 'police', 'station', 'demandingly', 'better', 'mom', 'around', 'son', 'call', 'shots.Overall', 'well', ""n't"", 'as', 'forgettable', 'movie', ""'re"", 'probably', 'guessing', 'second', 'half', 'really', 'just', 'feel', 'so', 'bad', 'girl', 'who', 'was', '*tremendously*', 'sweet', 'was', 'just', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'really', 'feel', 'character']",N/A
1571603,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B008NBH09W,Doug Park,"[3, 4]","Made-for-TV movie where Greg, a popular high school football jock, bets his buddy, Jared, that he can ""make it with any chick in this school!"" He tapes his bedroom encounter with Lexi, a very attractive ""Class-A prude,"" on his laptop just for the sake of proving to Jared that it really happened. However, Greg's ultra-vain, jealous, and apparently sociopathic ex-girlfriend gets ahold of his I-phone and forwards the taped encounter to half the school. A long string of tragedy follows.Positives:--Compelling enough story that keeps your attention;--Several intriguing layers of plot, with the sort of conflict that we actually hear about in the news;--Fairly decent acting by some of the cast;--Characterization improves in the latter parts of the film;--The film has some submerged yet meaningful statements to make about our society, particularly on the lack of privacy we face in the I-phone age and the effects of so many single-parent families.Negatives:--The various complications, which begin to get interesting in the second half, are resolved way too quickly and too easily. Another 45-60 minutes of development would be helpful here.--Dodges certain difficult questions about what becomes of certain characters by leaving them unanswered.--Admittedly, believably capturing a high school is not an easy thing for directors and actors to accomplish. Still, ""Betrayed at 17"" perpetuates every common stereotype about teenagers and high school life. The TV Land dialogue is to blame for much of this. Another sample: ""She's probably jealous of you because you're smart. . .and pretty, and she's pretty much an airhead!""--Entire mood and atmosphere of the film are quite contrived and soap opera-ish.",3,So-So Artificial Drama,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,1707,"['Made-for-TV', 'movie', 'where', 'Greg', 'popular', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'jock', 'buddy', 'Jared', 'can', 'make', 'chick', 'school', 'bedroom', 'encounter', 'Lexi', 'very', 'attractive', 'Class-A', 'prude', 'laptop', 'just', 'sake', 'proving', 'Jared', 'really', 'happened', 'However', 'Greg', 'ultra-vain', 'jealous', 'apparently', 'sociopathic', 'ex-girlfriend', 'ahold', 'I-phone', 'forwards', 'taped', 'encounter', 'school', 'long', 'string', 'tragedy', 'follows.Positives', 'Compelling', 'enough', 'story', 'attention', 'Several', 'intriguing', 'layers', 'plot', 'sort', 'conflict', 'actually', 'hear', 'news', 'Fairly', 'decent', 'acting', 'cast', 'Characterization', 'latter', 'parts', 'film', 'film', 'submerged', 'yet', 'meaningful', 'statements', 'make', 'society', 'particularly', 'lack', 'privacy', 'face', 'I-phone', 'age', 'effects', 'so', 'many', 'single-parent', 'families.Negatives', 'various', 'complications', 'begin', 'get', 'interesting', 'second', 'half', 'are', 'resolved', 'way', 'too', 'quickly', 'too', 'easily', '45-60', 'minutes', 'development', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'here.', 'certain', 'difficult', 'questions', 'what', 'becomes', 'certain', 'characters', 'leaving', 'unanswered.', 'Admittedly', 'believably', 'capturing', 'high', 'school', 'not', 'easy', 'thing', 'directors', 'actors', 'accomplish', 'Still', 'Betrayed', '17', 'perpetuates', 'common', 'stereotype', 'teenagers', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'TV', 'Land', 'dialogue', 'blame', 'much', 'sample', 'probably', 'jealous', ""'re"", 'smart', '.and', 'pretty', 'pretty', 'much', 'airhead', 'Entire', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'contrived', 'soap', 'opera-ish']",N/A
1571604,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B008NBH09W,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[0, 0]","Premiering as a Lifetime network original movie, ""Betrayed at 17"" has all the trappings that you would expect from such a distinction. I can be critical of the Lifetime brand with movies that tend to veer between sensationalized instances based on real life and thrillers of fantastical proportions. While ""Betrayed at 17"" feels a bit more grounded than the network's usual fare and tries to offer more realistic situations, it still strains under a soapy formula and stock characters. There is an interesting angle on the typical bullying story, but the screenplay lacks the subtlety to really let people connect with the material. The villains are painted in broad strokes, the victimization is devastating, and yet don't be surprised that there are important life lessons to be learned by everyone. The movie has a certain sincerity, I just wished that it had felt a bit more realistic (and not so much like an lurid after school special).Before I get into the movie, has anyone else noticed that a lot of terrible things happen when you're seventeen on the Lifetime network? Thing's have gotten really rough for our teenage girls! At last count, we've been Dead at 17, Accused at 17, Stalked at 17, and a Fugitive at 17! See, there are worse things than Betrayal!Amanda Bauer plays our seventeen year old heroine. She is flattered when the school's football star (Andy Fischer-Price) asks her out, but unbeknownst to her--his motives are not gentlemanly. As a part of a bet, he is trying to bed her and he captures the moment on video. Shocking! His attention to the meek student (he's not all bad) infuriates his evil ex (Carleigh Taylor) who sends the illicit footage to everyone in school. Naturally, this mortifies Bauer who begins a horrifying withdrawal. That's when ""Betrayed at 17"" kicks into another gear. It becomes a story about family, mother love, and the crusade for justice. Alexandra Paul, as Bauer's mother, steps into focus. And where the first half had been largely a high school movie, the second half attempts to address harder and bigger questions. Unfortunately, though, the answers arrive too quickly and too easily. This is a subject that really requires a more in-depth and thoughtful approach to really make much impact.On some level, I really wanted to like ""Betrayed at 17"" more than I did. It is earnest and I liked some of the performers, specifically Paul and Fischer-Price. There is potentially a great story floating around here somewhere, I just don't think it comes close to being fully realized. The production could have benefited from more actual drama as opposed to soapy melodrama as well as better dialogue (especially in high school scenes). In the end, I didn't necessarily hate ""Betrayed at 17."" But it's not a movie that I will remember in a couple of months either. About 2 1/2 stars, this might be fine to watch for free on TV (where it aired) but it's hard to recommend as a DVD purchase.
