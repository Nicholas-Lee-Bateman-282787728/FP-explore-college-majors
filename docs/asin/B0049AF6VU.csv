1389361,AY12DBB0U420B,B0049AF6VU,Gary Peterson,"[3, 3]","Our three-year-old boy just loves heavy equipment such as trucks, busses, trains and airplanes. As such, we get him a variety of toys along those lines and my wife brought home a Chuggington DVD (""The Chuggington Championships""). Well, the kid just loves that DVD! It's amazing! He can sit down and view the entire DVD without a break. I think one of the reasons is that the DVD is broken into six small stories. All of them attract his attention but none of them exceed his attention span. It's a well made product for very small children.Well, with that kind of success, we just had to have another Chugginton DVD and my wife bought ""Chuggers to the Rescue."" It's much the same as the original. The music is the same. The introductions to the stories are the same. The length of the stories is comparable. The characters are much to same. Same old, same old. But the kid loves it. That's what counts. Just like the first DVD, he'll sit there and watch story after story. One difference is the introduction of a flying chugger, a train with jet engines under small wings. I know, I know, the whole thing is totally absurd, but it really captivates the kid's imagination.So, what does an adult think of this? Well, it's corny, over animated and the voices are over acted. After a few watches, I'm burned out. The music is bouncy and infectious, but, again, gets on my nerves after a while. I have a slight preference for the first DVD but that may only be that is was fresh and new when I first heard it. The real test is with the kid, not with me. Well, our little toddler just loves these Chuggington DVDs and that's worth five stars. In my opinion, you might start off with the ""Chugger Championship"" DVD and then ease into others, but any way you do it, the kid will probably love them.Gary Peterson",5,Our Toddler Just Loves Chuggington DVDs.,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,1803,"['three-year-old', 'boy', 'just', 'heavy', 'equipment', 'such', 'trucks', 'busses', 'trains', 'airplanes', 'such', 'get', 'variety', 'toys', 'lines', 'wife', 'brought', 'home', 'Chuggington', 'DVD', 'Chuggington', 'Championships', 'Well', 'kid', 'just', 'DVD', 'amazing', 'can', 'sit', 'down', 'view', 'entire', 'DVD', 'break', 'think', 'one', 'reasons', 'DVD', 'broken', 'six', 'small', 'stories', 'attract', 'attention', 'none', 'exceed', 'attention', 'span', 'well', 'made', 'product', 'very', 'small', 'children.Well', 'kind', 'success', 'just', 'had', 'have', 'Chugginton', 'DVD', 'wife', 'bought', 'Chuggers', 'Rescue', 'much', 'same', 'original', 'music', 'same', 'introductions', 'stories', 'are', 'same', 'length', 'stories', 'comparable', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'same', 'Same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'kid', 'what', 'Just', 'first', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'sit', 'there', 'watch', 'story', 'story', 'One', 'difference', 'introduction', 'flying', 'chugger', 'train', 'jet', 'engines', 'small', 'wings', 'know', 'know', 'whole', 'thing', 'totally', 'absurd', 'really', 'kid', 'imagination.So', 'what', 'adult', 'think', 'Well', 'corny', 'animated', 'voices', 'are', 'acted', 'few', 'watches', ""'m"", 'burned', 'out', 'music', 'bouncy', 'infectious', 'again', 'nerves', 'while', 'have', 'slight', 'preference', 'first', 'DVD', 'may', 'only', 'be', 'was', 'fresh', 'new', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'real', 'test', 'kid', 'not', 'Well', 'little', 'toddler', 'just', 'Chuggington', 'DVDs', 'worth', 'five', 'stars', 'opinion', 'might', 'start', 'off', 'Chugger', 'Championship', 'DVD', 'then', 'ease', 'others', 'way', 'do', 'kid', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'them.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A
