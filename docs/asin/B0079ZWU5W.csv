Films that take place in the ocean have always interested me I guess.Halle Berry loses a friend/mentor in a shark attack. She blames herself for his death and doesn't go back to shark studying because of it. Her estanged husband, who's also the photographer at the attack, wants to get back with her plus continue the business. An obnoxious, but wealthy businessman hires them so he can swim with sharks with his son. His son doesn't really want to be there, but wants to be there before his dying father dies. Dad apparently has somewhat of a deathwish since he already knows he's dying.The initial dive isn't that successful and dad wants way more action with much bigger sharks. Halle Berry's character finally angrily agrees, taking them out into much more dangerous waters where the Great White Sharks dwell. One or two predictable things happen, and they find themselves sinking and fighting for their lives in very choppy waters. The ending is again pretty predictable, and I'm not exactly sure what was accomplished.Great shark footage here and decent on water and underwater cinematographyhere. Halle look great as usual. Acting was good, but I found myself not really caring for anyone in the cast. Just an overall obnoxious bunch of people. I think I was actually rooting for the sharks.

1528790,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0079ZWU5W,Jason,"[3, 6]","Based very loosely on a South African named Mike Rudson, Dark Tide explores the world of sharks via a shark expert known to some as ""The Shark Whisperer.""  The name is essentially where the comparison ends, however, and there isn't much more to this film than a poor attempt to recreate the mediocre success ofInto the Blue.For what it's worth, Halle Berry plays a Shark Tourism expert who apparently can tame the sharks, roll onto their backs, and make them go into a trance.  This is a concept I completely understand since Berry can do this to human males as well.  I digress.  After a whispering hiatus - the result of a mishap when one of her aquatic pals got confused with the homonym ""chum"" - she returns to the South African waters thanks to a wealthy, arrogant businessman and his pansy son.  Of course they didn't get along.  And since it was so obviously foreshadowed, there is no real spoiler in mentioning one of them should have been credited in the movie as ""Shark Fodder.""  Seas rage, storms wail, sharks circle menacingly, insert a bit of drama and a poorly conceived romantic angle about as endearing as a tree-top stalker with KY and binoculars, and the result is utterly predictable.  Special shout-out to the atrocious writing that reduced an Academy Award winner into perhaps the worst delivery of her career.Ultimately this movie fails to live up to the shark predecessor (Leading Lady: Alba vs. Berry=tie, Romantic Counterpart: Walker>Martinez, Third wheel with little man syndrome: Caan>Ralph).At least the lighting in Into the Blue was professionally done, and enough of Alba's derriere was shown that it was censored in some countries (warning: the lighting in this movie is horrible through most of the climax and a few other scenes).

She used to swim with great whites until the tragic death of her mentor. Blaming herself and her old partner and husband, Jeff (Olivier Martinez), she watches as her boating business begins to dry up. People want to see sharks not dolphins and other marine mammals.Kate used to have this philosophy, ""You're told your whole life that sharks are dangerous. And then finally you're under water and you see the very thing you were taught to fear. And it's perfect. My father once told me to be careful of the things we love most in the world. Because if you're not careful, that very thing can also destroy you.""Her husband reminds her of how she used to think, and approaches her with the challenge -- a thrill-seeking millionaire wants to swim with the great whites. With debt mounting, and no other way out, she eventually gives in.Some of the footage is amazing.""I touched a real shark, like a real great white shark in the wild,"" Halle said.  ""When I went to go touch the shark they had me tethered to the boat, and I finally said, `Wait a second, why am I tied to the boat?'

The film starts out great showing us Halle Berry's cleavage, a guy filming her cleavage, and then they throw a shark into the film...and no more cleavage. Halle's hobby is to pet Great Whites in open water out of a cage. She is married to Jeff who films the action. So when sharks suddenly behave badly, Halle quits diving with them.After a year, Jeff is trying to get back with Halle. The have fights about the relationship. The film contains Halle doing a first person philosophical narration and the music is very tame, not what one expects for an action/thriller. Halle who has spent 10 years in the water doesn't like the smell of fish and screams when someone tries to push her in. Clearly this is an action flick written for women, or by a woman (Amy Sorlie). In one scene Jeff apologizes for whatever it was that made Halle angry. Halle is angry that he doesn't know why she is angry and won't tell him...because he should know!  She finally says, ""You have no idea what's wrong with me!""As Halle's business starts to fail, a wealthy Brit (Ralph Brown) trying to connect with his son (Mark Elderkin) wants to swim with Great Whites without a cage. Halle is reluctant but agrees.They set out in the water to go dancing with sharks. And if everything went well, there wouldn't be a movie. Dad fights with son, Jeff fights with dad, Halle fights with Jeff, and Halle fights with dad. At this point I was hoping a two headed mega shark would swallow the whole boat. The climatic scene I can't detail because I have no idea what is happening. Everyone is in the same dark suits and it is dark. The full view film of the sharks appear to be stock footage. (Ed Wood would be so proud.) This is more of a drama with some poorly shot action scenes.No f-bombs (that I caught), sex, or nudity. Some PG-13 name calling.

I think the audience is supposed to feel some sort of remorse or sadness when the bad things go down but really it is just a relief as it meant the movie was nearing the end!You would be better of going to the local aquarium to view live sharks swim around their tanks for a couple of hours than spending any time on this mistake of a film - don't waste your time on this one!",1,I rooted for the Sharks!!,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,1440,"['beautiful', 'academy', 'winning', 'actress', 'sexy', 'French', 'film', 'star', 'made', 'famous', 'Horseman', 'Roof', 'Beautiful', 'South', 'African', 'scenery', 'what', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'Um', 'just', 'everything', 'Let', 'start', 'Halle', 'Olivier', 'movie', 'supposedly', 'where', 'now', 'married', 'couple', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'hard', 'believe', 'zero', 'chemistry', 'Olivier', 'give', 'up', 'smoking', 'immediately', 'Halle', '5', 'oclock', 'shadow', 'most', 'scenes', 'Maybe', 'paying', 'actor', 'salaries', 'was', ""n't"", 'money', 'left', 'over', 'make', 'up', 'artist', 'seriously-', 'two', 'best', 'looking', 'people', 'planet', 'look', 'crap', 'are', 'wearing', 'goofy', 'deep', 'sea', 'diving', 'masks', 'enormous', 'flippers', 'story', 'Halle', 'supposed', 'be', 'famous', 'Shark', 'Whisperer', 'who', 'free', 'dives', 'then', 'up', 'great', 'whites', 'reading', 'body', 'language', 'not', 'making', 'bubbles', 'ridiculous', 'scary', 'moments', 'are', 'telegraphed', 'so', 'far', 'advance', 'was', 'almost', 'screaming', 'just', 'attack', 'already', 'menacing', 'sharks', 'think', 'audience', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sort', 'remorse', 'sadness', 'when', 'bad', 'things', 'go', 'down', 'really', 'just', 'relief', 'meant', 'movie', 'was', 'nearing', 'end', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'going', 'local', 'aquarium', 'view', 'live', 'sharks', 'swim', 'tanks', 'couple', 'hours', 'spending', 'time', 'mistake', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'one']",Dark Tide
1528817,AB1CKA6B849SP,B0079ZWU5W,zeus,"[4, 7]","I tried to figure out what is the point of the movie, and I came to the conclusion that some of the actors/producers needed the money really bad and decided to quickly make a movie. They recruited Halle Berry, made sure that she spends 3/4 of the time in a bikini, and some good actors (name recognition) who really didn't try very hard. When you see Halle Berry on the cover in a bikini (same most of the time; need more variety, maybe need to consult with Sports Illustrated), one must anticipate good acting too (i.e. Monster's Ball). Well, this is not the case for Berry, and definitely not the case for the rest of the cast.Halle plays somebody who talks/lives with the sharks, and makes movies (documentaries) until a shark eats her best friend/mentor (beautiful shark attack at the beginning of the movie, probably the best scene of the movie, makes you jump out of your seat). After that she quits working for National Geographic and tries to do tourist tours but it doesn't work. And we are in for a boring 20-40 minutes.Then a rich ahole (...aren't they all according to the rich people in Hollywood who know everything?) with his son arrives in his private plane (..and he smokes too..., he definitely deserves to die!) and wants to touch the sharks too. At this point everybody is fighting on the boat and I could have told you who are the people who are going to die and get eaten by the sharks one hour into the movie. They are going to fish in Shark Alley territory (ouuuh!). But we have to wait all the way to the end to see the predictable ending.Quick question for the director/producers: When you have a boat that cannot stir and is speeding towards the rocks, don't you think that it would make sense to cut the engine, and try to fix it, instead of panicking and trying desperately to fix the engine that leaks oil (while it is running and speeding towards the rocks), with a pair of pliers? Just thinking out loud. I know that somehow they must end in the water with the big sharks to end the movie, but please make un effort, don't assume everybody is ignorant! Just pay attention to the details. With Halle Berry and the price you are charging that was not supposed to be a B/C movie.And throughout the movie we have Olivier Martinez speaking with a totally fake pathetic French accent.Two stars for the beautiful shots of South Africa that really makes you want to go there and play with the sharks too (in a cage)! Since this movie is not going to be blockbuster, maybe this movie should be given to the officials dealing with tourism in South Africa to promote their beautiful country. At least that will be useful.",2,"Predictable, and mediocre acting!",1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,2642,"['tried', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'point', 'movie', 'came', 'conclusion', 'actors/producers', 'needed', 'money', 'really', 'bad', 'decided', 'quickly', 'make', 'movie', 'recruited', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'made', 'sure', '3/4', 'time', 'bikini', 'good', 'actors', 'name', 'recognition', 'who', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'very', 'hard', 'When', 'see', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'cover', 'bikini', 'same', 'most', 'time', 'more', 'variety', 'maybe', 'need', 'consult', 'Sports', 'Illustrated', 'one', 'must', 'anticipate', 'good', 'acting', 'too', 'i.e', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'Well', 'not', 'case', 'Berry', 'definitely', 'not', 'case', 'rest', 'cast.Halle', 'somebody', 'who', 'sharks', 'movies', 'documentaries', 'shark', 'best', 'friend/mentor', 'beautiful', 'shark', 'attack', 'beginning', 'movie', 'probably', 'best', 'scene', 'movie', 'jump', 'seat', 'working', 'National', 'Geographic', 'tries', 'do', 'tourist', 'tours', ""n't"", 'work', 'are', 'boring', '20-40', 'minutes.Then', 'rich', 'ahole', 'are', ""n't"", 'according', 'rich', 'people', 'Hollywood', 'who', 'know', 'everything', 'son', 'private', 'plane', 'too', 'definitely', 'die', 'touch', 'sharks', 'too', 'point', 'everybody', 'fighting', 'boat', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'who', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'get', 'eaten', 'sharks', 'one', 'hour', 'movie', 'are', 'going', 'fish', 'Shark', 'Alley', 'territory', 'ouuuh', 'have', 'wait', 'way', 'end', 'see', 'predictable', 'ending.Quick', 'question', 'director/producers', 'When', 'have', 'boat', 'can', 'not', 'stir', 'speeding', 'rocks', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'cut', 'engine', 'try', 'fix', 'instead', 'panicking', 'trying', 'desperately', 'fix', 'engine', 'oil', 'running', 'speeding', 'towards', 'rocks', 'pair', 'pliers', 'Just', 'thinking', 'out', 'loud', 'know', 'somehow', 'must', 'end', 'water', 'big', 'sharks', 'end', 'movie', 'please', 'make', 'un', 'effort', 'do', ""n't"", 'assume', 'everybody', 'ignorant', 'Just', 'pay', 'attention', 'details', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'price', 'are', 'charging', 'was', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'B/C', 'movie.And', 'movie', 'have', 'Olivier', 'Martinez', 'speaking', 'totally', 'fake', 'pathetic', 'French', 'accent.Two', 'stars', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'South', 'Africa', 'really', 'want', 'go', 'there', 'play', 'sharks', 'too', 'cage', 'movie', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'blockbuster', 'maybe', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'officials', 'dealing', 'tourism', 'South', 'Africa', 'promote', 'beautiful', 'country', 'least', 'will', 'be', 'useful']",Dark Tide
