1382243,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B0041SI7E8,D.P.,"[2, 3]","United States Champion Daniel Bryan vs. Ted Dibiase - For weeks, Dibiase has issues with Goldust in getting back his Million $ Championship but once they returned the title to his dad, Dibiase decided that he didn't want that belt but another one...Bryan's U.S. title & as a side note, they had some technical difficulties early with the lights.  Dibiase pulled out some moves that weren't typical of him early on such as an elbow drop off the top rope onto Bryan who was lying on the apron.  They went back & forth throughout the contest pulling out such moves as Bryan doing a suicide dive onto the floor but overshooting Dibiase & landing on his shoulder on the floor, Dibiase giving one hell of an impactful clothesline that turned Bryan inside out, Bryan delievering a back suplex from the top rope that still had Bryan hurting his shoulder while Dibiase landed on his head.  Throughout the time, Dibiase was able to keep countering the LaBell lock until third time was the charm but it was the aftermath that was unexpected which we later found out was a prelude to an ""AWESOME"" moment the next night on RAW.  This was a very good opening match.John Morrison vs. Sheamus - They began fighting right away with Morrison being more aggressive such as delivering his corkscrew dive onto the outside & only to keep pounding on Sheamus afterwards.  Sheamus was able to gain control for most of the match with a ""ground & pound"" offense by beating on Morrison's chest & back while also punishing his hurt leg with moves like a boston crab before Morrison was able to get a offensive rush & deal out more than he usually does to come back from behind with a win.  This was another good match.Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Kaval - Kaval cashed in his NXT title shot here after beating Ziggler on the previous SmackDown & it should be noted that one of the men that Striker mentioned that Kaval dedicated this match to is former TNA star Homicide.  This was very fast paced with Kaval relying on his strikes & high flying such as a springboard moonsault, an attempted twisting splash where he landed on his feet, and enziguiri from the top rope.  Dolph took a couple of stiff kicks that saw him bleeding from the nose along with seeming like he was off a step towards the end but both men.  This was definately the most athletic match of the night & the best showcasing of Kaval in WWE to date while Dolph is still showing his potential to be a big time player in the future.  As a side note, the commentary on Vickie Guerrero was just hysterical here.Elimination Match: Rey Mysterio, Big Show, M.V.P., Chris Masters, Kofi Kingston vs. Alberto Del Rio, Tyler Reks, Jack Swagger, Cody Rhodes, Drew McIntyre - This was a really fun elimination match that had it's various moments like Alberto Del Rio pushing his character by only getting in the match whenever the member of the other team is down & avoiding them when it's a fair fight, Big Show delievering the knockout punch that everyone was waiting for, Cody Rhodes reaction to getting hit in the face, Tyler Reks making a quick impression against Big Show by taking him off his feet, Jack Swagger's counters to both the 619 & chokeslam, and Mysterio & Show taking a page out of ""Andre & Jimmy Snuka's"" playbook.  Again, this was a fun match.Divas Champions LayCool vs. Natayla - This did it's job in having Natayla finally defeat them to win the championship but it was the aftermath that was real noteworthy here with Natayla getting real emotional along with the return of a ""Glamazon.""  This was pretty short & sweet but entertaining for what it was.World Champion Kane vs. Edge - For weeks before the show, Edge kidnapped Paul Bearer & held him hostage in a wheelchair.  Edge played mind games with Kane early by teasing Kane with an empty wheelchair which worked as Kane was off his game early.  Kane was able to regain control with fury as he was constantly screaming ""WHERE IS MY FATHER!"" while just beating on Edge.  Unfortunally as hot as this match started, it heavily slowed down & never gained any momentum which completely killed the crowd.  The ending was creative in order to setup a rematch but with the way this match happened, the ending hurt more than helped this match as it was what happened afterwards that was more impactful than anything that happened during the match.WWE Tag Team Champions The Nexus vs. Santino Marella & Vladimir Kozlov - This was a match that was really just there past Santino having his usual comedic moments at times but just nothing more than a filler between the two title matches.No DQ/No Count Out Match w/special referee John Cena: WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Wade Barrett - The tagline for this match was ""Free Or Fired"" as under the orders of Wade Barrett, Cena would be free from Nexus if Barrett wins the championship but fired from WWE if he didn't win the championship.  Cena stated that he would call the match down the middle which he did as both men were distracted early with Cena taking control allowing the opponent to take advantage.  Throughout the match, Barrett kept questioning Cena's calls to the point where he got so fustrated that he shoved Cena...which was the straw that broke the camels back as Cena did something that caused a result that shocked Orton & Cena himself by their facial expressions.  This match was better than their match at Bragging Rights but not by much as it was still the same concept in that it completely revolved around ""What's John Cena Going To Do?""In the end, the first two hours were without one of the best shows of the year as far as quality but then things took a heavy turn with the last three title matches as the tag title match was pointless, the World Title match never left first gear, and Orton & Barrett was once again all about Cena instead of having a quality match.  Overall, the understand is what made this PPV so I would definately recommend as the first 2/3 of this show was definately one of the best of the year.",4,Free Or Fired,1290643200,"11 25,

1382244,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B0041SI7E8,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[0, 0]","WWESURVIVOR SERIES 2010I have to say from the beginning that the opening video for this event was absolutely perfect. Very well put together from clips to audio all the way to the music, very well done indeed.Spoilers1.[US TITLE]DANIEL BRYAN VS TED DIBIASE-we start with a good opening contest between these two. Ted was on a mission following his cool run with Goldust to get his Dad's belt back. This mission of course was to get the U.S. title off of Bryan and he does all he can to make that happen. The action is fast paced and great between the two with Bryan hurting his shoulder. Bryan keeps the title after finally locking up the LaBell lock in a good opening contest only to be blasted from behind by the Miz, love him.2.SHEAMUS VS JOHN MORRISON-my boy Sheamus was in action this time around against the man that called him a bully. That man of course was John Morrison who leading up to this started this feud by aiding those who were being picked on by Sheamus. Of course that was mainly Santino which was actually funny, loved that tea party thing on Raw. This match was real aggressive on both parts which made it even more entertaining. Sheamus punishes Morrison for most of the match but John comes back to secure the win.3.[I-C TITLE]DOLPH ZIGGLER VS KAVAL-one of my favorite matches on the card as both guys did really well here. The previous Smackdown was the set up for this since Kaval beat Ziggler in a non title match. In doing so he took his title shot here which was guaranteed since he won NXT. After watching this match even now I still don't know how the WWE let Kaval get away from them. His performance here was excellent and Ziggler was great as well. They slip a little at the end but still it was a great match, Dolph ends up rolling him up on a reversal to keep the belt.4.[TRADITIONAL SS MATCH]REY MYSTERIO, BIG SHOW, KOFI KINGSTON, M.V.P., CHRIS MASTERS VS ALBERTO DEL RIO, DREW MCINTYRE, JACK SWAGGER, CODY RHODES, TYLER REKS-now I am a huge fan of these matches here and miss the old days when every match were these ones at this event. The title says it all to me and it made the event special and unique. This like every other does not disappoint as it is real fun. The eliminations are great as is the action and all the back and forth here. I personally love Del Rios strategy here in this match coming in when people are down, love it. Of course Rey's tram would end up winning but this is a great match I highly recommend.5.[HANDICAP DIVAS TITLE]LAYCOOL VS NATALYA-this is a much better match than most divas matches are. Of course every time they are good chances are Natalya is in it. This was what most people were waiting for as Natalya wins the Divas title finally with a sharpshooter. Beth Phoenix returns here as well, the other real wrestler from the Divas.6.[WORLD TITLE]KANE VS EDGE-the story here was after Kane's domination of his brother the Undertaker Edge came about as the next challenger. Surprisingly it was Edge that was the one playing the mind games here and winning. He kidnapped Paul Bearer who is Kane's father and was driving Kane nuts. The match its self was good but one of the slower ones of the night. Still both put on a good show with Kane trying to wear Edge down. The ending was great as Edge nailed a spear on Kane only to have both of their shoulders down, then of course Kane takes a ride on a wheelchair.7.[TAG-TITLE]HEATH SLATER & JUSTIN GABRIEL VS SANTINO MARELLA & VLADIMIR KOZLOV-this is actually a much better tag match than people give it credit for. Sure it is a filler and showcases Santino and his comedic stuff but I actually like this match. There are some good spots here and they battle back and forth. The Nexus keeps the belts in the end but it was a good match.8.[WWE TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS WADE BARRETT-now the big deal here was really John Cena being forced to be the ref for this match. His battles with The Nexus had brought him to a point to where he was forced to join. But it came time for this match and Wade Barrett gave Cena an option. It was if you help me win you are free from Nexus but if Randy wins I fire you form the WWE. The match was good none the less as I had expected from these two since I am a big fan of Barrett. This seemed like more of a brawl than anything else but it was all about what would Cena do. In the end Cena shoved Wade into an RKO and counted the three count. In doing so he would be fired and his and Randy's reactions after were great. Also Nexus came down but were quickly dealt with, and then Cena gave his final [or so he thought] final good byes to the fans.BONUS[WWE TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS WADE BARRETT-this was a rematch on Raw because the GM thought Wade got cheated by Cena. So with that said the picked up where they left off at. Right before the match Nexus attacked Orton and injured his knee, easy target. So during the match Wade attacked the knee like crazy going for the win. Then as Barrett was going to finish off Orton for the title we get ""a hit & run from Cena"" as Cole put it. In doing so Randy keeps the belt after finishing off Barrett, still I would get my way. Even thought I wanted Wade to win right after the match The Miz came down and cashed in his money in the Bank. Miz would target Randy's knee as well but it would be Miz reversing Orton's RKO that would lead to him winning the title. I remember watching this live and just going crazy when Miz won. Also we got that classic shot of that little girl all mad about it, but I was all that is happy.",5,GOOD EVENT WITH AN AWESOME SPECIAL FEATURE,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,5515,"['WWESURVIVOR',
