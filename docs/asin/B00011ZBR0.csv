790832,A32VHSK5LPVJKE,B00011ZBR0,Bice,"[11, 21]","First off, I should say that I'm definitely not an expert on Anime, so I can't compare Princess Nine to other movies / tv shows of the same style.  I bought this set (the complete series) for my 5 (soon to be 6) year old daughter for Xmas for two reasons:  She kept watching the Princess Nine preview on her Sailor Moon DVDs over and over, and I found this set marked down to a very reasonable price at a local store.Since the back of the box says ""Contains mature situations,  parental guidance is suggested"", I figured I should watch it before letting my daughter see it (imagine that, responsible parenting...but I digress).  I figured that the ""cleaned up"" versions of Sailor Moon that she watches are OK, and Princess Nine was advertised there, so it should be OK.After watching the whole thing, I'm not sure if I should let my five year old see it.  The series is theoretically about a girl's baseball team and how they overcome the prejudice of an all-boy's sport.  But those aspects really only make up about a quarter of the series, with the rest being a soap opera about topics such as love triangles (both the girls and the adults), alcoholism (the coach) and space aliens (no, I'm not kidding).  There's a lot of sexism, both from the male players and reporters who come in contact with the girls team, and from the animators themselves who insist on frequently drawing the girls in bimboish outfits and various states of undress (shower scenes, getting out of wet clothes after being caught in the rain, etc).  For example, the closing credits of every episode feature a bunch of cheesecake drawings of the girls on the team, ending for some bizarre reason with a topless rendering of the main character (turned so you can't actually see anything).  Who exactly are they trying to sell this show to, [...]?But the main reason I'm considering keeping this from my daughter is the language.  Just for the heck of it I kept a count, and the series contains 13 uses of ""hell"", 17 uses of ""damn"" (including 11 ""damn it"" and 2 ""god damn""), 5 ""ass"" (including ""I should shove that barbell up your ass""), 4 ""bastard"", 3 ""bitch"" (""stuck up bitch"", ""her royal bitchness"" and ""son of a bitch""), and 2 uses of ""pissed off"".  Then there more minor things like ""hellacious"", ""sucks"" and ""crap"", and stuff that would be difficult to explain to a young child like ""sex life"", ""lovers"", ""that time of the month"" and ""having your period"".  If it weren't for all the language, I'd gladly let my daughter watch the series and I'm sure she'd love it.  But I can just see her going to kindergarden and using words like ""hell"", ""damn"" and ""bitch"".  My wife would kill me.What I can't figure out is why they felt the need to include such language when they dubbed it into English.  If you're old enough to be hearing that language, you're probably too old to be watching such a melodramatic, predictable cartoon show (which is really what it amounts to, regardless of the quality of the animation).  I'm no religious fanatic or prude, but it just seems unnecessary.I did notice that the first half of the series (episodes 1-13) don't seem to be quite as bad as the second half.  It's almost like they started out wanting to make a series for kids and decided part-way through switch to an adult audience.  Maybe I'll let my daughter watch the first two or three discs and see how that goes.At any rate, at least it's better than Sailor Moon - the main character is actually likable and admirable rather than annoying (although Princess Nine does have its own annoying, high-pitched and whiny characters), and the plot isn't exactly the same episode after episode.  The girls of Princess Nine do work things out for themselves, and don't need a Tuxedo Mask to save them every episode.  Also, the Princess Nine is set in real-life Japan (well, except for the space alien part) instead of the usual anime fantasy land.All in all, I'd recommend this series to girls in the late elementary school or junior high age range, if their parents don't mind them hearing some four-letter words.  Older girls would probably think the series is a little too childish, and young boys certainly aren't going to want to watch a series centered around a girls' baseball team.",3,Not necessarily for young kids,1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,4246,"['First', 'should', 'say', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'not', 'expert', 'Anime', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'Princess', 'Nine', 'other', 'movies', '/', 'tv', 'shows', 'same', 'style', 'bought', 'set', 'complete', 'series', '5', 'soon', 'be', '6', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Xmas', 'two', 'reasons', 'kept', 'watching', 'Princess', 'Nine', 'preview', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'DVDs', 'found', 'set', 'marked', 'down', 'very', 'reasonable', 'price', 'local', 'store.Since', 'back', 'box', 'Contains', 'mature', 'situations', 'parental', 'guidance', 'suggested', 'figured', 'should', 'watch', 'letting', 'daughter', 'see', 'imagine', 'responsible', 'parenting', 'digress', 'figured', 'cleaned', 'up', 'versions', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'watches', 'are', 'OK', 'Princess', 'Nine', 'was', 'advertised', 'there', 'should', 'be', 'OK.After', 'watching', 'whole', 'thing', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'should', 'let', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'see', 'series', 'theoretically', 'girl', 'baseball', 'team', 'how', 'overcome', 'prejudice', 'all-boy', 'sport', 'aspects', 'really', 'only', 'make', 'up', 'quarter', 'series', 'rest', 'being', 'soap', 'opera', 'topics', 'such', 'love', 'triangles', 'girls', 'adults', 'alcoholism', 'coach', 'space', 'aliens', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', 'lot', 'sexism', 'male', 'players', 'reporters', 'who', 'come', 'contact', 'girls', 'team', 'animators', 'who', 'insist', 'frequently', 'drawing', 'girls', 'bimboish', 'outfits', 'various', 'states', 'undress', 'shower', 'scenes', 'getting', 'wet', 'clothes', 'being', 'caught', 'rain', 'etc', 'example', 'closing', 'credits', 'episode', 'feature', 'bunch', 'cheesecake', 'drawings', 'girls', 'team', 'ending', 'bizarre', 'reason', 'topless', 'rendering', 'main', 'character', 'turned', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actually', 'see', 'anything', 'Who', 'exactly', 'are', 'trying', 'sell', 'show', '[', 'main', 'reason', ""'m"", 'considering', 'keeping', 'daughter', 'language', 'Just', 'heck', 'kept', 'count', 'series', '13', 'uses', 'hell', '17', 'uses', 'damn', 'including', '11', 'damn', '2', 'god', 'damn', '5', 'ass', 'including', 'should', 'shove', 'barbell', 'up', 'ass', '4', 'bastard', '3', 'bitch', 'stuck', 'up', 'bitch', 'royal', 'bitchness', 'son', 'bitch', '2', 'uses', 'pissed', 'off', 'Then', 'more', 'minor', 'things', 'hellacious', 'sucks', 'crap', 'stuff', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'explain', 'young', 'child', 'sex', 'life', 'lovers', 'time', 'month', 'having', 'period', 'were', ""n't"", 'language', ""'d"", 'gladly', 'let', 'daughter', 'watch', 'series', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'love', 'can', 'just', 'see', 'going', 'kindergarden', 'using', 'words', 'hell', 'damn', 'bitch', 'wife', 'would', 'kill', 'me.What', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'felt', 'need', 'include', 'such', 'language', 'when', 'dubbed', 'English', ""'re"", 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'hearing', 'language', ""'re"", 'probably', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'watching', 'such', 'melodramatic', 'predictable', 'cartoon', 'show', 'really', 'what', 'regardless', 'quality', 'animation', ""'m"", 'religious', 'fanatic', 'prude', 'just', 'unnecessary.I', 'did', 'notice', 'first', 'half', 'series', '1-13', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'second', 'half', 'almost', 'started', 'out', 'wanting', 'make', 'series', 'kids', 'decided', 'part-way', 'switch', 'adult', 'audience', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'let', 'daughter', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'discs', 'see', 'how', 'rate', 'least', 'better', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'main', 'character', 'actually', 'likable', 'admirable', 'rather', 'annoying', 'Princess', 'Nine', 'have', 'own', 'annoying', 'high-pitched', 'whiny', 'characters', 'plot', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'same', 'episode', 'episode', 'girls', 'Princess', 'Nine', 'do', 'work', 'things', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'Tuxedo', 'Mask', 'save', 'episode', 'Also', 'Princess', 'Nine', 'set', 'real-life', 'Japan', 'well', 'space', 'part', 'instead', 'usual', 'anime', 'fantasy', 'land.All', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'series', 'girls', 'late', 'elementary', 'school', 'junior', 'high', 'age', 'range', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'hearing', 'four-letter', 'words', 'Older', 'girls', 'would', 'probably', 'think', 'series', 'little', 'too', 'childish', 'young', 'boys', 'certainly', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'want', 'watch', 'series', 'centered', 'girls', 'baseball', 'team']",N/A

Being raised with baseball however, it never ceased to attract my attention as a lifetime fan, player, and student of the game.When I finally took the plunge and forked over the $54 to purchase it, I was optimistic. When I began watching the series, I was hooked instantaneously. I was thrilled as the series unfolded into a complete Anime - a compelling story, a cast of individually unique and extremely interesting characters, and the perfect blend of action, suspense, drama, comedy, romance, and inspiration. It is often said that true masterworks of Anime are those which the viewer wishes to never see end - ""Princess Nine"" is without a doubt a member of that category.Although not all may understand its message, its symbols, or its true meanings, this is an Anime you will regret missing for as long as you own a DVD Player or any other form of Media Player. With a ""not what you expected"" ending which may leave some unsatisfied, and the extreme disappoint which follows when discovering there is no sequel - some may find this series to be disappointing. But in this case, the pros outweigh the cons by 100-fold.This is a truly inspirational anime.

I only know a handful of them too and I've watched well over 100 different series.The animation director really knew how to build up suspense and tension that's a highly important factor to an anime like this. Nicely made.My only complaint was that it did pi$$ me off a bit because there was quite a bit of love related drama between the main characters, a love triangle. It effected their gaming and, even though it helped build up the suspense which means a better ending, it did frustrate me somewhat to watch them crumble because of some typical anime love dramas. What do I mean typical anime love dramas? Watch hana yoridango, peach girl, marmalade boy and you'll see what I mean.

790840,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B00011ZBR0,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[2, 3]","In the spirit of baseball classics like The Natural and Field of Dreams comes a sports drama of the highest calibur... The story of this excellent 26 episode Sports Saga centers on one Ryo Hayakawa and her dream of becoming a great pitcher like her father. But that doesn't even begin to tell you the real story. Like most stories worth telling, there is much depth hidden beneath the surface of this one.The general atmosphere and tone of the show starts out light and easy, but as the story progresses we quickly come to appreciate that pretty much EVERYONE in this story has a hidden past worth hearing about. The background of characters is told through a series of background examinations and flashbacks, and as the characters learn more about each other we are drawn further into their world, and they are drawn closer to each other.Interestingly, there are aren't ALL that many basball games in this show (for a series all about baseball). Much of the time will be spent developing everything from love-hate relationships between friends and rivals to overcoming obstacles in the way of the team and facing dark secrets of the past. But what baseball action there is in this one is really great. Key moments are given a boost by a reoccuring orchestral theme and the trademark speedlines-filled slow-motion (which personally I love). More importantly, all of the action has dramatic weight to it. So when you see over-the-top moves pulled off they seem more like great feats of strength under enormous pressure (kind of like shredding the ball in The Natural) rather than cheap tricks.As I said before, the orchestral music is quite outstanding and the action sequences are excellent, as is the character devlopment and story. It should also be mentioned though, that the voice-acting in the English Dub is some of the greatest to be found in any anime, and all of characters are interesting enough to transcend the anime stereotypes. While the art quality in the series may be somewhat inconsistent, it is never bad by any means, and the animation and character designs are top-quality.Really, this is one of the best anime I have ever seen. It ranks up there with Crest of the Stars, Angelic Layer, and Battle Athletes Victory (the other sports anime of choice). Oh, and the ending is sad, inspiring, original, and totally satisfying.

What you get is the starting lineup of characters in anime show `Princess Nine.'The chairwoman of an exclusive all girls' prep school once believed she had it all. A bright future with a young all star pitcher destined to become the greatest pitcher in all of Japan. When controversy took over his life her life was thrown into the madness and left alone. Only from there she climbed to the top and along with her stature had a daughter who was destined to become the youngest tennis pro in all of Japan. All was in place until she found a shadow from her past in the pitching arm of a 15 year old girl named Ryo, who happened to be the daughter of her lost love. With the past rushing back to her, she felt it necessary to give her life closure and clear her lost loves name. She recruits Ryo to become the starting pitcher of Japans very first all girls high school baseball team. With the help of an old friend and a bunch of very diverse personalities, the team is formed. Now, the battle begins to get to the championship series and prove to the world that baseball is not just for the boys.This story revolves around three major characters, Ryo, Izumi (the tennis player) and her mother (The chairwoman). It is a brilliant story about baseball, coming of age and lost love. The character development is absolutely brilliant. With such a huge cast of characters within only a 26 episode span, each character becomes such a huge part of the story. What makes anime so great is the detail put into every character and not just the main ones. There are great side stories and moving back stories on all the members of the girls' team. Each girl is unique with a personality that can be related to by someone. There are some hysterical moments and moments that will make you shed a tear. If you are a fan of sports movies you will probably like this show. Even if you have never seen an anime show in your life, this show is very unlike the norm. There are a lot of moments that are derived from some of the great sports movies in the past 40 years. You can surly see moments from films like: The Bad News Bears, The Sandlot, and The Natural, (just to name a few). It is a show that lets the viewer know that you can always achieve your goals in all areas of life even if the toughest of obstacles are thrown in front of you. I loved this show and honestly I wish there was more of it I just felt that there was so much more of a story to be told, but still `Princess Nine' is a winner.",5,A Real Champion.,1250035200,"08 12, 2009",2009,2791,"['What', 'when', 'put', 'following', 'together', 'tennis', 'prodigy', 'country', 'girl', 'wannabe', 'starlet', 'rebel', 'brainiac', 'gentile', 'giant', 'space', 'case', 'boy', 'crazy', 'softball', 'MVP', 'comic', 'book', 'reading', 'future', 'house', 'wife', 'year', 'young', 'girl', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'can', 'throw', 'wicked', 'fastball', 'What', 'get', 'starting', 'lineup', 'characters', 'anime', 'show', 'Princess', 'Nine', 'chairwoman', 'exclusive', 'girls', 'prep', 'school', 'once', 'believed', 'had', 'bright', 'future', 'young', 'star', 'pitcher', 'destined', 'become', 'greatest', 'pitcher', 'Japan', 'When', 'controversy', 'took', 'over', 'life', 'life', 'was', 'thrown', 'madness', 'left', 'alone', 'Only', 'climbed', 'top', 'along', 'stature', 'had', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'destined', 'become', 'youngest', 'tennis', 'pro', 'Japan', 'was', 'place', 'found', 'shadow', 'past', 'pitching', 'arm', '15', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'named', 'Ryo', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'daughter', 'lost', 'love', 'past', 'rushing', 'back', 'felt', 'necessary', 'give', 'life', 'closure', 'clear', 'lost', 'loves', 'name', 'Ryo', 'become', 'starting', 'pitcher', 'Japans', 'very', 'first', 'girls', 'high', 'school', 'baseball', 'team', 'help', 'old', 'friend', 'bunch', 'very', 'diverse', 'personalities', 'team', 'formed', 'Now', 'battle', 'get', 'championship', 'series', 'prove', 'world', 'baseball', 'not', 'just', 'boys.This', 'story', 'revolves', 'three', 'major', 'characters', 'Ryo', 'Izumi', 'tennis', 'player', 'mother', 'chairwoman', 'brilliant', 'story', 'baseball', 'coming', 'age', 'lost', 'love', 'character', 'development', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'huge', 'cast', 'characters', 'only', '26', 'episode', 'span', 'character', 'huge', 'part', 'story', 'What', 'anime', 'so', 'great', 'detail', 'put', 'character', 'not', 'just', 'main', 'ones', 'are', 'great', 'side', 'stories', 'moving', 'back', 'stories', 'members', 'girls', 'team', 'girl', 'unique', 'personality', 'can', 'be', 'related', 'someone', 'are', 'hysterical', 'moments', 'moments', 'will', 'make', 'shed', 'tear', 'are', 'fan', 'sports', 'movies', 'will', 'probably', 'show', 'Even', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anime', 'show', 'life', 'show', 'very', 'norm', 'are', 'lot', 'moments', 'are', 'derived', 'great', 'sports', 'movies', 'past', '40', 'years', 'can', 'surly', 'see', 'moments', 'films', 'Bad', 'News', 'Bears', 'Sandlot', 'Natural', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'show', 'viewer', 'know', 'can', 'always', 'achieve', 'goals', 'areas', 'life', 'even', 'toughest', 'obstacles', 'are', 'thrown', 'front', 'loved', 'show', 'honestly', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'still', 'Princess', 'Nine', 'winner']",N/A
