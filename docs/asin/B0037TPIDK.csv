The astrology and organic foods episodes were spectacular! There was all the humor, the criticism and intelligence I've come to expect from this fine program.You know what else was spectacular? The Vatican episode. Rather like the ""200"" and ""201"" episodes of ""South Park"" the powers that be, in this case the same parent company, if I recall correctly, are content to remove this episode from history. It is not on this DVD, and it is no longer listed on the site for the show.Due to this I shall sadly not be buying this season on DVD. That's what torrents are for. I'll be happy to buy other seasons that aren't butchered and when Showtime puts this episode back into circulation on a DVD set, I'll buy it. But until then? No. Sorry, guys. It's a great show, but I will not accept buying an incomplete complete season.",2,"""Complete"" my fat backside...",1275609600,"06 4, 2010",2010,951,"['were', 'lot', 'wonderful', 'topics', 'covered', 'Season', '7', 'fine', 'show', 'Amazon', 'content', 'sell', 'will', 'not', 'name', 'fully', 'astrology', 'organic', 'foods', 'episodes', 'were', 'spectacular', 'was', 'humor', 'criticism', 'intelligence', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'fine', 'program.You', 'know', 'what', 'else', 'was', 'spectacular', 'Vatican', 'episode', '200', '201', 'episodes', 'South', 'Park', 'powers', 'be', 'case', 'same', 'parent', 'company', 'recall', 'correctly', 'are', 'content', 'remove', 'episode', 'history', 'not', 'DVD', 'no', 'longer', 'listed', 'site', 'show.Due', 'shall', 'sadly', 'not', 'be', 'buying', 'season', 'DVD', 'what', 'torrents', 'are', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'buy', 'other', 'seasons', 'are', ""n't"", 'butchered', 'when', 'Showtime', 'episode', 'back', 'circulation', 'DVD', 'set', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'then', 'No', 'Sorry', 'guys', 'great', 'show', 'will', 'not', 'accept', 'buying', 'incomplete', 'complete', 'season']",N/A
1329958,A17A112BBVP6WY,B0037TPIDK,M. Harney,"[5, 7]","I know many are up-in-arms against the exclusion of the Vatican episode, but this is really distracting from the real issue: Some of these topics have been done before.  The episode on the 2012 Apocalypse is just another version of their Season 1 ""End of the world"" episode only focusing exclusively on 2012.  Their episode on organic food is just a longer rant of their ""Eat this!"" episode.  Moreover, half of their ""Orgasms"" episode goes on attack of a Tantric sex workshop.  Wait, wasn't tatnric sex workshops already a target on the yoga/tantric sex episode?  It's not all bad though, I was very glad to finally see them do an episode on lie detectors, and astrology.  The video game and stress episodes were pretty good too.  Not a bad season, but with only 9 episodes and three having very familiar content, the price tag is a bit steep.  I'd say if you are a fan of the series, buy it when it's on sale.  As for the Vatican episode, I doubt it will ever grace a DVD set.  Either Showtime's parent company caved into pressure or there was some sort of injunction.  In either event, seeing it again seems unlikely.",3,Weakest season yet,1276560000,"06 15, 2010",2010,1119,"['know', 'many', 'are', 'up-in-arms', 'exclusion', 'Vatican', 'episode', 'really', 'distracting', 'real', 'issue', 'topics', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'episode', '2012', 'Apocalypse', 'just', 'version', 'Season', '1', 'End', 'world', 'episode', 'only', 'focusing', 'exclusively', '2012', 'episode', 'organic', 'food', 'just', 'longer', 'rant', 'Eat', 'episode', 'Moreover', 'half', 'Orgasms', 'episode', 'attack', 'Tantric', 'sex', 'workshop', 'Wait', 'was', ""n't"", 'tatnric', 'sex', 'workshops', 'already', 'target', 'yoga/tantric', 'sex', 'episode', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'very', 'glad', 'finally', 'see', 'do', 'episode', 'lie', 'detectors', 'astrology', 'video', 'game', 'stress', 'episodes', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'Not', 'bad', 'season', 'only', '9', 'episodes', 'three', 'having', 'very', 'familiar', 'content', 'price', 'tag', 'bit', 'steep', ""'d"", 'say', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'buy', 'when', 'sale', 'Vatican', 'episode', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'grace', 'DVD', 'set', 'Showtime', 'parent', 'company', 'caved', 'pressure', 'was', 'sort', 'injunction', 'event', 'seeing', 'again', 'unlikely']",N/A
1329959,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B0037TPIDK,Micheal Hunt,"[14, 14]","This is your perfect example of why people download things today. Now Penn & Teller should do a show on the B.S of B.S DVD releases.They did an episode on ""The Vatican"" and it was one of their best episodes they have done... yet, it is not on this DVD, which is why everyone is calling B.S on the B.S s7 release.It's really a shame that the best episode of the season has been removed with no explanation as to why?! So what you get is all BUT 1 episode, making this the INCOMPLETE season of B.S7.Now I'll do what vert few have done and review the rest the episodes.Episode 1: Orgasms- This is pretty much an excuse to get to see some nudity and cheap interest to watch; I'm not sure why, as the show has a pretty strong following as it is. But in this episode, they call B.S on a guy who runs classes in New York to supposedly teach men how to finger women properly. I guess the class would be ok for those who simply just can't ASK their partner to guide them through what they like, and instead get to go to a class and watch a guy teach them, have a random partner if you have none, then watch a girl squirt... if anything, it's probably going to just promote the guys ""orgy"" like group session.Episode 2: Astrology; An episode many have been asking for. It was a decent episode.Episode 3: Video Games; An episode that focus' on the nutballs against Video Game violence and trying to either put a stop to them or not allow them to be sold to underage kids... like that would stop anything? the more you tell kids they shouldn't do something, the more interest you will spark in them to find a way to play the game. The entire argument could well be based on how many kids who played Super Mario in the 80's felt a sudden need to go outside and punch bricks and jump on turtles.Episode 4: The Apocalypse; This is kind of the same thing as a previous episode called ""the end of the world"", but since the released of the movie 2012, they felt they needed to do one that focus' on what they forgot to include before.Episode 5: Lie Detectors; Here they show how to beat lie detectors and that they do not work. Duh. The machines detect changes in blood pressure etc.. but if you fart while answering a question, you can beat the defective machines.Episode 6: Organic Foods; Another episode where they use the same piece of fruit cut in half, and ask people to tell them which is organic and which isn't... reminded me of the ""Bottled Water"" episode, but hopefully it will wake up the hippy nut's to stop spending more on organic food when food is food.Episode 7: Taxes; In a lot of ways, everyone agrees with this one, but I felt it was like the ""cheerleader"" episode, where it just did not need to be stretched out into a half hour show to explain that taxes are B.S.Episode 8: Lawns; this was a pretty dull episode. It does not focus on the B.S of lawns as much as just the B.S law of a community in Florida that make you sign an agreement to maintain your lawn, or face prison for it. Sure, it's complete B.S, but it's really only something for THAT particular area of Florida, not something that is a law all over the country.Episode 9: Stress; Well, Stress isn't ""B.S"" but people who advertise ""Stress Relief"" is... I found it to be an episode that didn't quite scream out ""B.S"" but more ""Don't be so gullible""Then of coarse the last episode WOULD have been about the Vatican, and how they cover up Priests who molest people, ram their way of life down peoples necks, and refuse to allow condoms because they are too scared if they change that rule, people would want OTHER B.S rules they appose to be changed too. it was a great episode, but for some reason, it is has been removed from this DVD.Overall, what you get now, is decent, but would have been worth it had they included the best episode of the season. Instead, we have reviewers saying the same thing, that the Vatican episode would be there only reason to buy this season, but the B.S of B.S not including it is just totally effing B.S",2,"screaming B.S @ B.S ""complete season 7""",1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,4002,"['perfect', 'example', 'why', 'people', 'download', 'things', 'today', 'Now', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'should', 'do', 'show', 'B.S', 'B.S', 'DVD', 'releases.They', 'did', 'episode', 'Vatican', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'done', 'yet', 'not', 'DVD', 'why', 'everyone', 'calling', 'B.S', 'B.S', 's7', 'release.It', 'really', 'shame', 'best', 'episode', 'season', 'been', 'removed', 'explanation', 'why', 'what', 'get', 'BUT', '1', 'episode', 'making', 'INCOMPLETE', 'season', 'B.S7.Now', ""'ll"", 'do', 'what', 'vert', 'few', 'have', 'done', 'review', 'rest', 'episodes.Episode', '1', 'Orgasms-', 'pretty', 'much', 'excuse', 'get', 'see', 'nudity', 'cheap', 'interest', 'watch', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'show', 'pretty', 'strong', 'following', 'episode', 'call', 'B.S', 'guy', 'who', 'classes', 'New', 'York', 'supposedly', 'teach', 'men', 'how', 'finger', 'women', 'properly', 'guess', 'class', 'would', 'be', 'ok', 'who', 'simply', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ASK', 'partner', 'guide', 'through', 'what', 'like', 'instead', 'get', 'go', 'class', 'watch', 'guy', 'teach', 'have', 'random', 'partner', 'have', 'none', 'then', 'watch', 'girl', 'squirt', 'anything', 'probably', 'going', 'just', 'promote', 'guys', 'orgy', 'group', 'session.Episode', '2', 'Astrology', 'episode', 'many', 'have', 'been', 'asking', 'was', 'decent', 'episode.Episode', '3', 'Video', 'Games', 'episode', 'focus', 'nutballs', 'Video', 'Game', 'violence', 'trying', 'put', 'stop', 'not', 'allow', 'be', 'sold', 'underage', 'kids', 'would', 'stop', 'anything', 'more', 'tell', 'kids', 'should', ""n't"", 'do', 'something', 'more', 'interest', 'will', 'spark', 'find', 'way', 'play', 'game', 'entire', 'argument', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'based', 'how', 'many', 'kids', 'who', 'played', 'Super', 'Mario', '80', 'felt', 'sudden', 'need', 'go', 'outside', 'punch', 'bricks', 'jump', 'turtles.Episode', '4', 'Apocalypse', 'kind', 'same', 'thing', 'previous', 'episode', 'called', 'end', 'world', 'released', 'movie', '2012', 'felt', 'needed', 'do', 'one', 'focus', 'what', 'forgot', 'include', 'before.Episode', '5', 'Lie', 'Detectors', 'Here', 'show', 'how', 'beat', 'lie', 'detectors', 'do', 'not', 'work', 'Duh', 'machines', 'detect', 'changes', 'blood', 'pressure', 'etc..', 'fart', 'answering', 'question', 'can', 'beat', 'defective', 'machines.Episode', '6', 'Organic', 'Foods', 'episode', 'where', 'use', 'same', 'piece', 'fruit', 'cut', 'half', 'ask', 'people', 'tell', 'organic', ""n't"", 'reminded', 'Bottled', 'Water', 'episode', 'hopefully', 'will', 'wake', 'up', 'hippy', 'nut', 'stop', 'spending', 'more', 'organic', 'food', 'when', 'food', 'food.Episode', '7', 'Taxes', 'lot', 'ways', 'everyone', 'one', 'felt', 'was', 'cheerleader', 'episode', 'where', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'stretched', 'out', 'half', 'hour', 'show', 'explain', 'taxes', 'are', 'B.S.Episode', '8', 'Lawns', 'was', 'pretty', 'dull', 'episode', 'not', 'focus', 'B.S', 'lawns', 'as', 'much', 'just', 'B.S', 'law', 'community', 'Florida', 'make', 'sign', 'agreement', 'maintain', 'lawn', 'face', 'prison', 'Sure', 'complete', 'B.S', 'really', 'only', 'something', 'particular', 'area', 'Florida', 'not', 'something', 'law', 'country.Episode', '9', 'Stress', 'Well', 'Stress', ""n't"", 'B.S', 'people', 'who', 'advertise', 'Stress', 'Relief', 'found', 'be', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'scream', 'B.S', 'more', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'gullible', 'Then', 'coarse', 'last', 'episode', 'WOULD', 'have', 'been', 'Vatican', 'how', 'cover', 'up', 'Priests', 'who', 'molest', 'people', 'ram', 'way', 'life', 'peoples', 'necks', 'refuse', 'allow', 'condoms', 'are', 'too', 'scared', 'change', 'rule', 'people', 'would', 'want', 'OTHER', 'B.S', 'rules', 'appose', 'be', 'changed', 'too', 'was', 'great', 'episode', 'reason', 'been', 'removed', 'DVD.Overall', 'what', 'get', 'now', 'decent', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'had', 'included', 'best', 'episode', 'season', 'Instead', 'have', 'reviewers', 'saying', 'same', 'thing', 'Vatican', 'episode', 'would', 'be', 'only', 'reason', 'buy', 'season', 'B.S', 'B.S', 'not', 'including', 'just', 'totally', 'effing', 'B.S']",N/A
