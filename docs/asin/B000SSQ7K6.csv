1087734,A1FQ04UJHTGII1,B000SSQ7K6,Douglas Setter,"[1, 2]","This movie runs pretty close to violent classics like, I Spit On Your Grave.  While Gillian Anderson plays her role well, as a tough-minded, good-looking business woman, the story is too graphic for my taste.  The basic premise is that Anderson is a successful business woman who picks up a younger man and takes him to a party.  Some of the scenes really seemed unnecessary, like a guy in a wheel chair, at the party coming on to her, her having sex on the lawn with her boyfriend and her boyfriend cranking himself when alone.On their way home from the party, a truck full of drugged up men brutalize the couple.  Anderson is brutally raped and her boy toy is severly beaten.  She quickly sets up in a cabin which just happens to be easy access to the home of one of the rapists.  With a silenced rifle she looks for targets and sends her boyfriend on errands, like retrieving a dead dog and installing a movie camera inside of the rapist's home.  This dude plays her little helper monkey without taking any initiative on his own.  They catch one of the rapists and violate him in a gruesome fashion.  I had to fast forward through this movie hopeing that it would make some kind of sense.  While it might appeal to people who want to see a hard revenge flick, I found it hard to watch.Doug Setter, Bsc. author ofOne Less Victim: A Prevention GuideandStomach Flattening",2,Harsh revenge story,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,1371,"['movie', 'pretty', 'close', 'violent', 'classics', 'Spit', 'Grave', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'role', 'well', 'tough-minded', 'good-looking', 'business', 'woman', 'story', 'too', 'graphic', 'taste', 'basic', 'premise', 'Anderson', 'successful', 'business', 'woman', 'who', 'up', 'younger', 'man', 'party', 'scenes', 'really', 'seemed', 'unnecessary', 'guy', 'wheel', 'chair', 'party', 'coming', 'having', 'sex', 'lawn', 'boyfriend', 'boyfriend', 'cranking', 'when', 'alone.On', 'way', 'home', 'party', 'truck', 'full', 'drugged', 'up', 'men', 'brutalize', 'couple', 'Anderson', 'brutally', 'raped', 'boy', 'toy', 'severly', 'beaten', 'quickly', 'up', 'cabin', 'just', 'be', 'easy', 'access', 'home', 'one', 'rapists', 'silenced', 'rifle', 'targets', 'boyfriend', 'errands', 'retrieving', 'dead', 'dog', 'installing', 'movie', 'camera', 'rapist', 'home', 'dude', 'little', 'helper', 'monkey', 'taking', 'initiative', 'own', 'catch', 'one', 'rapists', 'violate', 'gruesome', 'fashion', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'movie', 'hopeing', 'would', 'make', 'kind', 'sense', 'might', 'appeal', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'hard', 'revenge', 'flick', 'found', 'hard', 'watch.Doug', 'Setter', 'Bsc', 'author', 'ofOne', 'Less', 'Victim', 'Prevention', 'GuideandStomach', 'Flattening']",Closure

The round-faced freshess of her X-Files days is gone, replaced by a sleek steeliness. And in this film she's 180-degrees different from her X-Files character, and for us that's a very good thing, because we see a performance that's tough--aggressive, even--unnerving (and that's even before she and her date are viciously attacked), and yet still vulnerable. Much is communicated through facial expressions and body language, not dialog. Danny Dyer's Adam is a perfect foil to her toughness, being basically a big kid at 23 with a low-paying job and a general innocence and decency that he holds onto through most of the film. The circumstances presented in the film are really just opportunities to explore the characters, as they both deal with the aftermath of brutality in different ways, shifting toward and away from each other, phasing between power and powerlessness, outrage and fear, conscience and brutality--sometimes all within the same scene. In this film what's gripping is less the plot (although there are a couple of nice twists at the end) than the character study of two people whose already-empty lives literally implode and the choices they make in the aftermath.

It had everything a smart, low-key psychological thriller needs. Then it all went to pot in the space of two or three minutes; another could-have-been great film that ended up mediocre.It starts off with what might be the least realistic opening scene in filmdom: an executive named Alice (Gillian Anderson), who's getting a security system installed in her swanky house, decides on a whim to ask Adam (Danny Dyer), the guy installing the system, to go to a big work do with her. I don't say unrealistic because of the situation; I say unrealistic because, well, it's GILLIAN ANDERSON. Why does she need to go hitting on security system installers when she could have me? But I digress. In any case, big party, driving home, car accident, very bad things happen with the locals. Cue big revenge drama, like Straw Dogs, but with the roles reversed-- Alice is the one hell-bent on making the bastards pay, while Adam, who lost an eye in the attack, is counseling moderation. Just when the two of them are ready to carry out Alice's dastardly plan, however, a monkeywrench is thrown into the works: the guy they're after has a daughter, Sophie (Francesca Fowler). Alice switches gears: she'll save the daughter before offing the father. This is not where the movie goes downhill (surprisingly), but this is where the setup for the implosion begins. By the time we get to the big climax-- which, as it turns out, is not big at all (it has the same anticlimactic feel as Straw Dogs, which I will keep referencing in this review until everyone's mad at me, but without anywhere near as much violence)-- we're entirely uncertain what's going on. There's a good deal of psychological trickery at play, but where any of it's going to lead is anyone's guess. Normally, that's a good thing. Here, it isn't.This made the Times' (London, not New York) 100 Best Films of 2007. Over Zodiac, no less, or even such lesser, but still not bad, lights as 1408. And I'll give you that for the first forty-five minutes or thereabouts, this really does have the quiet-thriller-that-blows-up-in-your-face feel to it, and I was completely ready to go wherever it took me. Then it started playing with what I can only assume was supposed to be ambiguity, and, well, things went downhill fast. I must admit, though, it was certainly nice to see that much of Gillian Anderson (who COULD'VE HAD ME!) for the first time since The Turning, and that may be enough to convince Anderson fans to give it a go; too bad the last half hour of the film doesn't hold up. **",2,"So much potential, and it all goes haywire.",1216339200,"07 18, 2008",2008,2894,"['Straightheads', 'Dan', 'Reed', '2007', 'something', 'weak', 'beginning', 'have', 'say', 'first', 'hour', 'Straightheads', 'released', 'US', 'Closure', 'struck', 'kind', 'movie', ""'m"", 'always', 'looking', 'overlooked', 'underrated', 'gem', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'simply', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'movies', 'seem', 'almost', 'pathologically', 'avoid', 'overthinking', 'had', 'everything', 'smart', 'low-key', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'needs', 'Then', 'went', 'pot', 'space', 'two', 'three', 'minutes', 'could-have-been', 'great', 'film', 'ended', 'up', 'mediocre.It', 'starts', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'least', 'realistic', 'opening', 'scene', 'filmdom', 'executive', 'named', 'Alice', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'who', 'getting', 'security', 'system', 'installed', 'swanky', 'house', 'whim', 'ask', 'Adam', 'Danny', 'Dyer', 'guy', 'installing', 'system', 'go', 'big', 'work', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'unrealistic', 'situation', 'say', 'unrealistic', 'well', 'GILLIAN', 'ANDERSON', 'Why', 'need', 'go', 'hitting', 'security', 'system', 'installers', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'digress', 'case', 'big', 'party', 'driving', 'home', 'car', 'accident', 'very', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'locals', 'Cue', 'big', 'revenge', 'drama', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'roles', 'reversed', 'Alice', 'one', 'hell-bent', 'making', 'bastards', 'pay', 'Adam', 'who', 'lost', 'eye', 'attack', 'counseling', 'moderation', 'Just', 'when', 'two', 'are', 'ready', 'carry', 'out', 'Alice', 'dastardly', 'plan', 'however', 'monkeywrench', 'thrown', 'works', 'guy', ""'re"", 'daughter', 'Sophie', 'Francesca', 'Fowler', 'Alice', 'gears', ""'ll"", 'save', 'daughter', 'offing', 'father', 'not', 'where', 'movie', 'downhill', 'surprisingly', 'where', 'setup', 'implosion', 'time', 'get', 'big', 'climax', 'out', 'not', 'big', 'same', 'anticlimactic', 'feel', 'Straw', 'Dogs', 'will', 'keep', 'referencing', 'review', 'everyone', 'mad', 'anywhere', 'as', 'much', 'violence', ""'re"", 'entirely', 'uncertain', 'what', 'going', 'good', 'deal', 'psychological', 'trickery', 'play', 'where', 'going', 'lead', 'anyone', 'guess', 'Normally', 'good', 'thing', 'Here', 'made', 'Times', 'London', 'not', 'New', 'York', '100', 'Best', 'Films', '2007', 'Zodiac', 'less', 'even', 'such', 'lesser', 'still', 'not', 'bad', 'lights', '1408', ""'ll"", 'give', 'first', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'thereabouts', 'really', 'have', 'quiet-thriller-that-blows-up-in-your-face', 'feel', 'was', 'completely', 'ready', 'go', 'wherever', 'took', 'Then', 'started', 'playing', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'ambiguity', 'well', 'things', 'went', 'downhill', 'fast', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'certainly', 'nice', 'see', 'much', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'who', 'COULD', 'HAD', 'ME', 'first', 'time', 'Turning', 'may', 'be', 'enough', 'convince', 'Anderson', 'fans', 'give', 'go', 'too', 'bad', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'film', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', '**']",Closure
1087746,AX1LBP3ENPLCG,B000SSQ7K6,Samantha M. Summers,"[9, 12]","I picked up this movie because I am such a fan of Gillian Anderson.Since 'X Files' I have only seen her in 'House of Mirth', and 'The Last King of Scotland'.Just so you're warned, 'Closure' is a violent movie. So you might not want to leave it out for the kids, or watch it say, the night before you are about to swap your apartment with someone on EBay who has a cottage in  the English countryside. Because 'Closure'is not quite like 'Holiday' with Jack Black, and Kate Winslet.Set mostly in rual England, it is the story of a Alice Comfort (Anderson)and her date Adam, an alarm systems manager, played by Danny Dyer, who are brutally attacked on their way home from a party. Both survive, but have very different coping mechanisms. One character regresses, with a child-like dependency on the other, who has become a vigilanty avenger.From the begining of the movie, Alice is an mysterious woman. She has a paraplegic boss who is obsessed with her, and the party she and Adam attend before the attack is so strange and subtle that I wondered for a minute if what followed was some type of set-up.Most Hollywood movies that are extremely violent have a way of 'glazing' the violence so that I don't usually feel extremely effected by it. One example is 'The Brave One', with Jodie Foster, which I recently saw in the theater. I felt like I was watching nothing more than a graphic novel brought to life.The climactic violence of 'Closure' takes place in farmhouse kitchen in the middle of the woods, and there was no glazed feeling.

Some previous reviewers have been quite harsh in their criticism, but my feeling is that it actually reflects human nature rather well. I.e. different people will react differently if they have been the subject of a violent attack.The cast all give decent performances with Gillian Anderson undoubtably the best actor in the film. However the big problem with the film is its lack of sympathetic characters. In the end you just don't care what happens to anybody.I'm grateful that some British films are still being made though.

1087749,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B000SSQ7K6,The Jaundiced Eye,"[23, 25]","I disagree with the opinions of many of the reviewers of this movie; it is better than their two-star rating would imply. Yes, there are weaknesses: background on the characters, particularly the character played by Gillian Anderson and the two most agressive attackers, was sorely lacking. The ability to travel miles through the forest on foot in mere seconds stretched credibility, and personality reversals seemed to occur frequently and with indistinct motivation. Was the daughter actually being molested by her father's associates, or was it merely a possibility? What's up with the abrupt ending? etc...etc...Despite the shortcomings, many scenes and situations were quite engaging. Anderson's character radiated an intense sexuality and her casual seduction of the security system tech was quite credible. I doubt that the ""relationship"" would have lasted long without the brutal interlude on their way home from the party, but once forced together by their shared horror and injury, the increasing pathology of their relationship becomes riveting. The gender reversal is a nice touch: she becomes stronger, dominant, and more bent on revenge; he shies away from violence, weak, damaged, and literally impotent.Eventually, this reversal is reversed, albeit without full justification in my opinion. Her desire for revenge is quickly sated, far short of what was originally planned, while his accelerates dramatically. Another paradox is presented by the rapist/father: he claims to have only raped the Anderson character to distract his cronies from raping his daughter, but he did so with a level of brutality that does not seem consistent with a ""fatherly"" figure. Then, this brutal rapist/concerned father suffers remorse that leads him to attempt suicide, which will leave his daughter at the mercy of the men from whom he originally sought to protect her. Illogical, but an interesting sequence of events.Likewise, the abrupt ending. At first I was shocked and disappointed, then I realized that nothing more could have been said or done. Any subsequent plot or dialog would have diminished the power of what occurred.The mere fact that I felt compelled to spend time analyzing the motivation for these plot and character twists supports my personal conviction that there are moments of high quality in this production. When a movie is entirely bad, there is absolutely no compulsion for analysis. I admit that flaws and contradictions exist in this production, but like a stew made from things of varying appeal...in my opinion, there is enough here to justify the meal.One final note: I agree with one reviewer in questioning the origination of the idea voiced repeatedly in reviews that the rapist/attackers were ""hunters"". It is clearly stated in the movie that the three men were out drinking and returning home. Hunting was never mentioned.",4,Flawed.....but definitely better than two stars,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",2007,2860,"['disagree', 'opinions', 'many', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'better', 'two-star', 'rating', 'would', 'imply', 'Yes', 'are', 'weaknesses', 'background', 'characters', 'particularly', 'character', 'played', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'two', 'most', 'agressive', 'attackers', 'was', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'ability', 'travel', 'miles', 'forest', 'foot', 'mere', 'seconds', 'stretched', 'credibility', 'personality', 'reversals', 'seemed', 'occur', 'frequently', 'indistinct', 'motivation', 'Was', 'daughter', 'actually', 'being', 'molested', 'father', 'associates', 'was', 'merely', 'possibility', 'What', 'up', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'etc', 'etc', 'shortcomings', 'many', 'scenes', 'situations', 'were', 'quite', 'engaging', 'Anderson', 'character', 'radiated', 'intense', 'sexuality', 'casual', 'seduction', 'security', 'system', 'tech', 'was', 'quite', 'credible', 'doubt', 'relationship', 'would', 'have', 'lasted', 'long', 'brutal', 'interlude', 'way', 'home', 'party', 'once', 'forced', 'together', 'shared', 'horror', 'injury', 'increasing', 'pathology', 'relationship', 'riveting', 'gender', 'reversal', 'nice', 'touch', 'stronger', 'dominant', 'more', 'bent', 'revenge', 'away', 'violence', 'weak', 'damaged', 'literally', 'impotent.Eventually', 'reversal', 'reversed', 'full', 'justification', 'opinion', 'desire', 'revenge', 'quickly', 'sated', 'far', 'short', 'what', 'was', 'originally', 'planned', 'accelerates', 'dramatically', 'paradox', 'presented', 'rapist/father', 'have', 'only', 'raped', 'Anderson', 'character', 'distract', 'cronies', 'raping', 'daughter', 'did', 'so', 'level', 'brutality', 'not', 'seem', 'consistent', 'fatherly', 'figure', 'Then', 'brutal', 'rapist/concerned', 'father', 'suffers', 'remorse', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'will', 'leave', 'daughter', 'mercy', 'men', 'whom', 'originally', 'sought', 'protect', 'Illogical', 'interesting', 'sequence', 'events.Likewise', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'first', 'was', 'shocked', 'disappointed', 'then', 'realized', 'nothing', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'done', 'subsequent', 'plot', 'dialog', 'would', 'have', 'diminished', 'power', 'what', 'occurred.The', 'mere', 'fact', 'felt', 'compelled', 'spend', 'time', 'analyzing', 'motivation', 'plot', 'character', 'twists', 'supports', 'personal', 'conviction', 'are', 'moments', 'high', 'quality', 'production', 'When', 'movie', 'entirely', 'bad', 'absolutely', 'compulsion', 'analysis', 'admit', 'flaws', 'contradictions', 'exist', 'production', 'stew', 'made', 'things', 'varying', 'appeal', 'opinion', 'enough', 'here', 'justify', 'meal.One', 'final', 'note', 'agree', 'one', 'reviewer', 'questioning', 'origination', 'idea', 'voiced', 'repeatedly', 'reviews', 'rapist/attackers', 'were', 'hunters', 'clearly', 'stated', 'movie', 'three', 'men', 'were', 'out', 'drinking', 'returning', 'home', 'Hunting', 'was', 'never', 'mentioned']",Closure
1087750,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B000SSQ7K6,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[1, 2]","I am not really sure where to begin with this movie, so I will open the floor with why I watched this film in the first place.  I watched ""Closure"" for two reasons.  The first is because I am a fan of Gillian Anderson.  Like many people I was introduced by Gillian Anderson when she played Dana Scully on the classic television show ""The X-Files"".  I have managed to see in her several other things throughout the years and I believe she is a fine actress.  The second reason I watched this movie is that it was recommended by a friend of mine, who said this movie was wrong on many different levels.Going into this movie I wasn't expecting a ""mainstream"" or ""Hollywood"" type film. In addition, I had already expected a bit of an exploitation film, due to the ""rape and revenge"" nature of the content. I also knew that this film was released in the UK under the title ""Straightheads"" not ""Closure"".  After watching this movie, I don't think the former or latter title really fits the substances of the film.  The one thing I know for certain, I was very disappointed when this motion picture was over.The plot is a bit implausible, yet simplistic; Alice (Gillian Anderson) is a classy business woman who is having a home security system installed.  The person installing the security system is Adam (Danny Dyer).  Due to some subtle sexual attraction, Alice invites Adam to be her date to her boss' birthday party.  At this point I raise my eyebrow at bit, but I guess this could happen.At the party Adam is out of place, more than likely due to the fact he is much younger than Alice.  This doesn't stop Alice and Adam to leave the party to have sex in the woods.  At this point I raise my other eyebrow, but there is such thing as bohemian lust.  On the way home from the party, Alice and Adam are driving and then ran off the road by another car.  Three men get out of the car and approach Alice and Adam.  At this point Adam is severely accosted and Alice brutally ganged raped.We now fast forward a month later and it appears that Adam is now living with Alice. They have both been traumatized from the attack; Adam is now reduced to wearing an eye patch. Adam is also a bit ""all over the place"" he is wayfaring through myriad emotions and is now impotent.  Alice has become very aloof and somewhat cold.  Her focus becomes vengeance.  This leads Alice and Adam to go after their attackers. There is a bit more to it, but not much and if a person has the desire to watch this film, I don't want to ruin it for them.The major problem I had with this movie was the character of Adam.  I am not sure what Danny Dyer was trying to do with this individual.  The wishy-washy nature of his character only vexed me; it didn't make me feel sympathetic for him.  Maybe this was the filmmakers' goal.  I also didn't see how a character that was this unstable would be still hanging around a woman he hardly knew.  I understand that there is an element of misattribution of emotion (the rape/attack) that they both went through.  In contrast, I don't see a professional business woman taking in an unstable person, who she shares no history prior to this tragic attack.  Yet maybe this duplicity was the filmmakers' goal.The first half of the movie was pretty good.  It appeared that there would be some element of revenge or dare I say ""closure"".  Then everything falls apart at the half way point of the movie.  The film is only about 80 minutes, so after the first 40 minutes I felt everything began to crumble.  It appears that half way through the movie, the filmmakers decided to make this story ""deeper"" and the ""villains"" more complex.  This ruse was a shoddy attempt to make this movie something that it wasn't.  When the credits rolled I was like ""wow, I can't believe I spent money on this movie"".In contrast, Gillian Anderson's performance was amazing.  Her British accent was awesome and I did care what happen to her character.  She was also extremely sexy and stylish in this movie.  I was also not expecting to she her unclad in this movie.  So I guess that is a bonus.  However, I don't like to gauge a movie on its amount of T&A;, if that were the cause all porno movies would be Oscar winners.  Her performance and some of the scenery in this movie is the ONLY reason I am giving this movie two stars.This movie had so much potential and it could have really been a great film.  This ""rape and revenge"" genre isn't anything new, remember ""I Spit on Your Grave""?  However, this movie fails terribly.  Not because it isn't ""I Spit on Your Grave"", but because the movie starts off strong and then gets flat. There was mood that this movie had, very eerie and haunting.  Consequently, the mood is totally divorced by misdirection, loop holes in plot and too many incredulous factors. Not to mention Danny Dyer's performance is embarrassing.  I'm done, no more blaming statements.In conclusion, there is an interesting scene in ""Closure"" involving sodomy with a rifle.  I can relate to this scene quite a bit.  For this scene is when I realized I sodomized out of the time and money I had put into this movie.  Now I need to have a long conversation with this friend of mine......",2,"Oh, what could have been......",1252454400,"09 9, 2009",2009,5187,"['am', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'where', 'begin', 'movie',

1087751,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000SSQ7K6,trebe,"[0, 0]","Gillian Anderson (The X-Files) and Danny Dyer (Severance) are victims of a violent crime seeking revenge, in Closure (aka Straightheads) (2007), a drama with some tense and genuinely touching moments.  Directed by Dan Reed, the story is fairly well told, and features some strong acting performances, but the film's ending leaves a bad aftertaste.  Spoilers follow, so proceed at your own risk.Set in Britain, businesswoman Alice Comfort (Anderson) has hired Alan (Dyer) to install a security system in her home.  She asks the 23 year-old to be her escort for the evening, at a party at her boss's home in the country.  The couple are attracted to each other, and before leaving the party, they have sex in the woods.  Cruising back to town in Alice's Lexus, they encounter a slower moving SUV in front of them, and Alan honks the horn as the Lexus races by.  Down the road the couple hit an elk, and while stopped along the road they are attacked by men in the SUV.  Adam is whacked in the head, while Alice is pulled from the car, and raped on the hood.The story jumps forward a month, and Alan has moved into Alice's apartment.  He has problems seeing out of one eye, and apparently suffers from sexual dysfunction.  Alice did not report the sexual assault, and the police have no leads who may be responsible for the attack.  Alice unexpectedly learns that her estranged father has died, and while visiting her father's house in the country, she sees one of the men that attacked her.  Coincidentally, her attacker named Heffer (Anthony Calf) lives a few miles from her father's house with his daughter Sophie (Francesca Fowler).  Together with a reluctant Alan, Alice begins to plot her revenge.  Breaking out her father's rifle, she begins practicing her shooting skills, and somehow gets hold of a silencer.Much of what happens, like Alice and Alan being free to devote their time to this venture, Alice running into Heffer, an unlikely attempted suicide, and Sophie's mysterious appearances, are a bit too convenient.  Setting those issues aside, you have a pretty edgy, though not entirely convincing drama, that mostly keeps you guessing which way things will go.  Adam manages to get into the attacker's home and plant some surveillance cameras, but this device doesn't seem to be used as well as it could have been.  There are a few moving revelations, some radical twists, and brutal sadistic violence unexpectedly explodes.  Unfortunately the final twist leaves a bit too much unsettled and up in the air, causing what could have been an excellent movie, to rate only 3.5 stars.Danny Dyer is pretty convincing playing a younger man, bringing believability, frustration, and sensitivity to his performance.  Gillian Anderson is very good, in an emotionally stressful and challenging role, going from victim to vigilante.  You feel her pain when she is ravaged, and understand her desire for revenge.
