I am truly stunned by the positive reviews of this movie I read here. ""Haiku Tunnel"" was simply NOT FUNNY. I really don't know what else to say about it. I'd discuss its plot, but it didn't really have one. (Huge dork can't manage to mail 17 important letters for his boss, given a whole week in which to do it, doesn't deserve to be called a plot.)Oh, and when Josh (somehow) gets laid, it has got to be the least sexy sex scene ever committed to film.I was befuddled by the ""R"" rating as well. Evidently laughable (and mostly clothed) coupling plus a couple of four-letter words will do that. But this time I agree with the MPAA--as many people should be protected from this disaster of a film as possible.In closing, I will say that ""Haiku Tunnel"" is a perfect example of why Sony shouldn't call its ""indie"" film arm ""Sony Picture Classics."" This movie shouldn't even be in the same paragraph as the word ""classic,"" unless we're talking about a classic example of how to waste a lot of people's time and money.",1,This is the worst movie I've ever seen,1086480000,"06 6, 2004",2004,1073,"['Yes', 'right', 'taken', 'away', 'Congo', 'am', 'truly', 'stunned', 'positive', 'reviews', 'movie', 'read', 'here', 'Haiku', 'Tunnel', 'was', 'simply', 'NOT', 'FUNNY', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'say', ""'d"", 'discuss', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'one', 'Huge', 'dork', 'ca', ""n't"", 'manage', 'mail', '17', 'important', 'letters', 'boss', 'given', 'whole', 'week', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'called', 'plot', 'Oh', 'when', 'Josh', 'somehow', 'laid', 'got', 'be', 'least', 'sexy', 'sex', 'scene', 'ever', 'committed', 'film.I', 'was', 'befuddled', 'R', 'rating', 'as', 'well', 'Evidently', 'laughable', 'mostly', 'clothed', 'coupling', 'couple', 'four-letter', 'words', 'will', 'do', 'time', 'agree', 'MPAA', 'many', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'protected', 'disaster', 'film', 'possible.In', 'closing', 'will', 'say', 'Haiku', 'Tunnel', 'perfect', 'example', 'why', 'Sony', 'should', ""n't"", 'call', 'indie', 'film', 'arm', 'Sony', 'Picture', 'Classics', 'movie', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'be', 'same', 'paragraph', 'word', 'classic', ""'re"", 'talking', 'classic', 'example', 'how', 'waste', 'lot', 'people', 'time', 'money']",Haiku Tunnel

I contemplated renting this movie many times but always held back because of the mixed reviews. One day I finally broke down and rented it and was very glad I did.Maybe it hits home for me because I also worked for a temp agency before &quot;going perm.&quot; And I do have this burning sense of creativity inside of me that sometimes takes priority over my work, just as the character of Josh places more importance on working on his novel than mailing out 17 &quot;very important&quot; letters for his boss. And yes, I do have a co-worker that is as flamboyant as the character of Clifford. But I don't think either of these qualities make it necessary to enjoy this film.Anybody with a slightly quirky or odd sense of humor should definitely enjoy this one.

686151,A3VFKQ1XYDY24J,B00005UW7H,Donald Chewms,"[12, 14]","I think the biggest problem this movie faces is that people watch it expecting the next Office Space, which really isn't fair to either film. Office Space is, of course, a truly great comedy well on its way to becoming classic. But the style of humor employed in Office Space and Haiku Tunnel is way different.That being said, I don't believe a minute passed in this movie where I wasn't laughing out loud. Although I did not really identify with the main character of Josh in any way (nor any of the characters now that I think about it), I found him to be very interesting and I enjoyed following his daily adventures as a temp gone perm.This movie was a great character study of various people from all walks of life ending up in the same small space, which I'm sure anybody that's worked in any kind of office can relate to.

686152,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005UW7H,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","Balding, bulbous Josh Kornbluth stars in this extremely low-budget 2001 movie which he also co-wrote and co-directed with his brother. From this bargain basement set-up comes a frequently funny, sometimes insightful comedy about surviving the trials and tribulations of office politics. As a San Franciscan who has experienced the local economic downturn firsthand, I was recommended this movie by a friend who thought I could relate to the predicaments of the main character. Toward that end, much like a series of live action Dilbert cartoons, Kornbluth does an often spot-on job capturing the inanities of the workplace and dealing with one's boss and co-workers.""Haiku Tunnel"" doesn't really have a plot, but the slim premise revolves around seventeen letters that ""have to go out right away"" according to the unctous boss, typically named Bob. In what appears to be not too much of an acting stretch, Kornbluth portrays ""Josh Kornbluth"" (with quotations please), an aspiring novelist living in a depressive funk and working contently as an office temporary worker. For one procrastinating reason after another, ""Josh"" can't seem to get the letters out, and in a contained world that seems to thrive on passive-aggressive behavior, he faces little retribution for his failure. Although no DeNiro, Kornbluth does capture the subservient demeanor of a temp accurately, doing a lackey's shuffle when the boss is around or, when he's late, an all-too-innocent float past the desk of the head secretary, played with a chilly sense of curtailed authority by Helen Shumaker. At heart, ""Josh"" is really a sad sack having just been dumped by his mountain-biking girlfriend. He's a guy with nothing going on and no pleasure except finding his way to his bed in San Francisco's mixed Mission district. He is comfortable with his limitations as a temp, but it's the promise of health benefits that persuades ""Josh"" to switch from temp to permanent status. So when he takes a full-time job at the law firm Schuyler and Mitchell (""S&M;""), he can have the firm pay for his psychotherapy sessions to remove his apparent writer's block. I do love how ""Josh"" suddenly becomes visible in the eyes of his co-workers only once he goes ""perm"". And in a funny cameo appearance, Harry Shearer plays a patronizing company trainer teaching the finer points of dealing with jammed paper in the copier.The film gets somewhat off-track when ""Josh"" gets involved with Julie, an attorney who becomes attracted to him as she mistakes him for an eccentric tax attorney. Sarah Overman is actually terrific as Julie, but the movie slides into some surreal world that diminishes audience sympathy for ""Josh"" at a rather critical juncture in the threadbare story. The seduction scene actually reminds me of a similar scene in Tom Hanks' film, ""Big"", and the movie never quite gains its footing afterward. But at that point, it doesn't seem to matter as the movie has already lost its steam. I give kudos to Kornbluth for making a clever assault on the white-collar workplace, but rent episodes of Ricky Gervais' ""The Office"" if you want a more pointed satire of that world.",3,Funny Workplace Insights But Loses Steam Before the Finish,1106524800,"01 24, 2005",2005,3140,"['Balding', 'bulbous', 'Josh', 'Kornbluth', 'extremely', 'low-budget', '2001', 'movie', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'co-directed', 'brother', 'bargain', 'basement', 'set-up', 'frequently', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'insightful', 'comedy', 'surviving', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'office', 'politics', 'San', 'Franciscan', 'who', 'experienced', 'local', 'economic', 'downturn', 'firsthand', 'was', 'recommended', 'movie', 'friend', 'who', 'thought', 'could', 'relate', 'predicaments', 'main', 'character', 'Toward', 'end', 'much', 'series', 'live', 'action', 'Dilbert', 'cartoons', 'Kornbluth', 'often', 'spot-on', 'job', 'capturing', 'inanities', 'workplace', 'dealing', 'one', 'boss', 'co-workers', 'Haiku', 'Tunnel', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'plot', 'slim', 'premise', 'around', 'seventeen', 'letters', 'have', 'go', 'out', 'right', 'away', 'according', 'unctous', 'boss', 'typically', 'named', 'Bob', 'what', 'be', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'acting', 'stretch', 'Kornbluth', 'Josh', 'Kornbluth', 'quotations', 'please', 'aspiring', 'novelist', 'living', 'depressive', 'funk', 'working', 'contently', 'office', 'temporary', 'worker', 'one', 'procrastinating', 'reason', 'Josh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'letters', 'out', 'contained', 'world', 'thrive', 'passive-aggressive', 'behavior', 'little', 'retribution', 'failure', 'DeNiro', 'Kornbluth', 'capture', 'subservient', 'demeanor', 'temp', 'accurately', 'doing', 'lackey', 'shuffle', 'when', 'boss', 'around', 'when', 'late', 'all-too-innocent', 'float', 'desk', 'head', 'secretary', 'played', 'chilly', 'sense', 'curtailed', 'authority', 'Helen', 'Shumaker', 'heart', 'Josh', 'really', 'sad', 'sack', 'having', 'just', 'been', 'dumped', 'mountain-biking', 'girlfriend', 'guy', 'nothing', 'going', 'pleasure', 'finding', 'way', 'bed', 'San', 'Francisco', 'mixed', 'Mission', 'district', 'comfortable', 'limitations', 'temp', 'promise', 'health', 'benefits', 'Josh', 'switch', 'temp', 'permanent', 'status', 'So', 'when', 'full-time', 'job', 'law', 'firm', 'Schuyler', 'Mitchell', 'S', 'M', 'can', 'have', 'firm', 'pay', 'psychotherapy', 'sessions', 'remove', 'apparent', 'writer', 'block', 'do', 'love', 'how', 'Josh', 'suddenly', 'visible', 'eyes', 'co-workers', 'only', 'once', 'perm', 'funny', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Harry', 'Shearer', 'patronizing', 'company', 'trainer', 'teaching', 'finer', 'points', 'dealing', 'jammed', 'paper', 'copier.The', 'film', 'somewhat', 'off-track', 'when', 'Josh', 'involved', 'Julie', 'attorney', 'who', 'attracted', 'eccentric', 'tax', 'attorney', 'Sarah', 'Overman', 'actually', 'terrific', 'Julie', 'movie', 'surreal', 'world', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'Josh', 'rather', 'critical', 'juncture', 'threadbare', 'story', 'seduction', 'scene', 'actually', 'similar', 'scene', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'film', 'Big', 'movie', 'never', 'quite', 'gains', 'footing', 'afterward', 'point', ""n't"", 'seem', 'matter', 'movie', 'already', 'lost', 'steam', 'give', 'kudos', 'Kornbluth', 'making', 'clever', 'assault', 'white-collar', 'workplace', 'rent', 'episodes', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'Office', 'want', 'more', 'pointed', 'satire', 'world']",Haiku Tunnel

The jacket would lead you to believe you've found a funny & clever working place story, but more than likely you'll be waiting for humor to shoot into orbit, when in reality it simply sputters on the launching pad.  The premise seems to hold validity as a funny scenario - successful temp becomes chaotic perm - but the writing and directing are a bit too amateurish to pull it all off.  Josh Kornbluth is able to entertain, but only in spurts during the film.  Some of it is very predictable, once you get going, and from there on you're waiting for something that just never happens. The only thing you'll be concentrating on is why the heck isn't he mailing the letters?

686154,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00005UW7H,Jeffrey Leach,"[0, 2]","The latter part of the 1990s, when more people than ever before toiled away in the corporate world thanks to a massive increase in dot.com jobs, saw the emergence of a particularly funny film called ""Office Space."" This movie dealt with the trials and tribulations of a young computer programmer as he attempted to navigate his way through the nerve racking atmosphere created by condescending bosses, cubicles, and weird co-workers. The film has since assumed the venerated moniker of ""cult classic,"" and rightfully so. Anyone who has served time in the corporate world instantly recognizes the annoying day to day events depicted in the film: the banal paperwork, the hierarchy of bosses, boredom, the perky office worker, consultants...the list could go on and on. ""Haiku Tunnel,"" while not achieving anything close to the magic of ""Office Space,"" covers much of the same territory. Instead of taking place in an IT firm, this film follows the exploits of a temporary worker whose world is suddenly turned upside down when a law firm offers him full-time employment. The title of the film comes from an architectural project the main character worked on during one of his temp assignments.Josh Kornbluth (played by Josh Kornbluth) is a wannabe author living in San Francisco who must work in between bouts of writing. He's a great temp employee, one of the best in fact, because the job allows him to move around the city without the long-term stress attendant to a regular job. All of that changes, however, when he shows up for an assignment at Schuyler & Mitchell (S&M;), a big shot law firm filled with a host of corny characters. For one thing, all of the attorneys have the name Bob, including Josh's newest boss Bob Shelby (Warren Keith). His co-workers are a bit odd too. You've got the evil office manager Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker), and a trio of annoying co-workers that won't have anything to do with Josh until they learn the company took him on full-time. Right from the start Kornbluth runs into trouble. The entire process of assuming responsibility saps his strength as an office employee. He finds himself working on his book at work, avoiding conflicts, and showing up late for the first time in ages. The real problems start with seventeen simple but very important letters that Shelby claims must go out in the mail immediately. For some reason, Josh cannot get them done. Days go by and the letters still sit on his desk like clouds of impending doom.The majority of the film centers on Josh's various efforts to find motivation to get these letters out. He does everything except mail the letters: his book distracts him, a relationship that springs up suddenly causes him to forget about the correspondence, and his neverending neurosis about everything from his bed to his former girlfriend constantly conspire to bring him down. As Josh anguishes about the letters, he learns much about his new corporate surroundings. He spends a day in orientation learning the ins and outs of such metaphysically important tasks such as how to clear jammed paper out of a copier (look for Harry Shearer in the role as the monotone instructor). In order to explain this alien world and his actions within it, the film occasionally cuts away to Josh standing in front of chalkboard for an ""actor to audience"" explanation of what's really going on. As for Kornbluth himself, he looks like...well, he's hard to describe. He's a pudgy, balding, loud guy with glasses that is about as far from a corporate type as you could imagine. In many ways, it is his appearance and how he conducts himself that makes ""Haiku Tunnel"" quite amusing.Unfortunately, not everything inspires laugh out loud laughter. Actually, I don't remember laughing out loud once during the entire movie, although I did find ""Haiku Tunnel"" entertaining and rather clever in spots. I think the performances are the best thing in the movie. Kornbluth's acceptable, but Helen Shumaker as the icy cold Marlina steals every scene she's in. The actress is quite beautiful in her way and has a wonderful head of hair, both of which she uses to great effect as she looms ominously over Josh's new life. The scene where he leaves a lengthy message on her answering machine, and her reaction to the same the next day, is worth seeing and something more of us should probably do to an irritating co-worker. As for the boss, everyone in the film talks about Bob Shelby as though he is Satan's son, but he actually comes off as a sort of absentminded, incompetent stooge. Josh's three co-workers tend to take things a bit overboard. DaVonne (June Lomena), a black gal with a lot of attitude, stands out of the bunch. Josh has a thing for her, and it's funny to watch her spurn his puppy dog advances. What I didn't like as much was Kornbluth's constant self-analysis and endless hamming. Throttling back on the Woody Allen shtick might have helped the film. The asides where Josh lectures the audience obviously comes from his background as a stage artist, and regrettably don't fit well in the movie.For a low budget film, the ""Haiku Tunnel"" DVD contains quite a few extras. You get several deleted scenes, a commentary track from Kornbluth, outtakes, and trailers for this film, ""Jackpot,"" and ""The Tao of Steve,"" which stars that annoying Scottish comedian Donal Logue. While Kornbluth's intensely personal film isn't as good as the awesome ""Office Space,"" it is worth watching. I would watch it again, in fact. This is the sort of film you absolutely much see if your corporate job is becoming too much to bear. It will probably make you feel slightly better to know there are many fellow sufferers.",4,Amusing,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,5675,"['latter', 'part', '1990s', 'when', 'more', 'people', 'ever',

Perhaps Josh is the only resource in the Unifoce pool; it's an implied possibility. In any case, the plot follows the first week of our hero's employment with the law firm of Schuyler & Mitchell (""S&M;""), where he's the personal secretary to one of the senior partners,  Bob Shelby (Warren Keith). Josh is so impressive on his first day that he's offered a permanent position, a turn of events that causes him no small degree of angst. Josh is comfortable being a ""temp"". As a matter of fact, everything about him seems temporary, including his relationships with the opposite sex and his dedication to his dream of being a successful novelist. Josh is easily sidetracked by his anxiety at the prospect of a steady gig, and this inability to focus endangers his position with S&M; as for four days he fails to get together and mail seventeen urgent letters for an incredibly patient Bob. The film's whole plot, mind you, revolves around this problematic stack of missives.The movie's most interesting persona is Marlina (Helen Shumaker), the Head Secretary and Kornbluth's immediate boss. She confronts Josh at the most inconvenient times, and voices her advice, admonitions, instructions or enquiries in a dead-pan and squinty-eyed, husky monotone that's positively eerie - an effect enhanced by the camera's close-up on her vaguely sinister face as she delivers her lines.At one point in the film, Josh reminisces about a previous job which involved his transcribing the engineering specs for the HAIKU TUNNEL, a highway tunnel ostensibly under construction in Hawaii. I share this trivia tidbit if you're wondering about the film's title. And, trust me, I haven't spoiled any part of the plot by offering this revelation.As with some trips I've taken, the attraction of HAIKU TUNNEL is in the Going rather than in the Getting There (because, as time and events prove, there's no ""there"" to get to). I was strangely fascinated by the quirky storyline, and kept waiting for the closing punch line to be delivered, or for the other shoe to drop. This either never happened, or was so subtle that I missed it. However, along the way, the screenwriters (Josh and Jacob Kornbluth and John Bellucci) illustrate some truths concerning the sterility and absurdities of the average 9 to 5. Perhaps, if you like the comic strip Dilbert, you'll see merit in this film.",3,Left me talking to myself,1036108800,"11 1, 2002",2002,2700,"['credits', 'rolled', 'HAIKU', 'TUNNEL', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'brilliance', 'had', 'passed', 'completely', 'head', ""'d"", 'just', 'seen', 'essentially', 'pointless', 'quixotic', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'comedy.Josh', 'Kornbluth', 'Josh', 'Kornbluth', 'cheerfully', 'oddball', 'character', 'employed', 'office', 'temp', 'agency', 'Uniforce', 'Perhaps', 'Josh', 'only', 'resource', 'Unifoce', 'pool', 'implied', 'possibility', 'case', 'plot', 'first', 'week', 'hero', 'employment', 'law', 'firm', 'Schuyler', 'Mitchell', 'S', 'M', 'where', 'personal', 'secretary', 'one', 'senior', 'partners', 'Bob', 'Shelby', 'Warren', 'Keith', 'Josh', 'so', 'impressive', 'first', 'day', 'offered', 'permanent', 'position', 'turn', 'events', 'small', 'degree', 'angst', 'Josh', 'comfortable', 'being', 'temp', 'matter', 'fact', 'everything', 'temporary', 'including', 'relationships', 'opposite', 'sex', 'dedication', 'dream', 'being', 'successful', 'novelist', 'Josh', 'easily', 'sidetracked', 'anxiety', 'prospect', 'steady', 'gig', 'inability', 'focus', 'endangers', 'position', 'S', 'M', 'four', 'days', 'get', 'together', 'mail', 'seventeen', 'urgent', 'letters', 'incredibly', 'patient', 'Bob', 'film', 'whole', 'plot', 'mind', 'problematic', 'stack', 'missives.The', 'movie', 'most', 'interesting', 'persona', 'Marlina', 'Helen', 'Shumaker', 'Head', 'Secretary', 'Kornbluth', 'immediate', 'boss', 'Josh', 'most', 'inconvenient', 'times', 'advice', 'admonitions', 'instructions', 'enquiries', 'dead-pan', 'squinty-eyed', 'husky', 'monotone', 'positively', 'eerie', 'effect', 'enhanced', 'camera', 'close-up', 'vaguely', 'sinister', 'face', 'lines.At', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'Josh', 'previous', 'job', 'involved', 'transcribing', 'engineering', 'specs', 'HAIKU', 'TUNNEL', 'highway', 'tunnel', 'ostensibly', 'construction', 'Hawaii', 'share', 'trivia', 'tidbit', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'film', 'title', 'trust', 'have', ""n't"", 'spoiled', 'part', 'plot', 'offering', 'revelation.As', 'trips', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'attraction', 'HAIKU', 'TUNNEL', 'Going', 'rather', 'Getting', 'because', 'time', 'events', 'prove', 'there', 'get', 'was', 'strangely', 'fascinated', 'quirky', 'storyline', 'kept', 'waiting', 'closing', 'punch', 'line', 'be', 'delivered', 'other', 'shoe', 'drop', 'never', 'happened', 'was', 'so', 'subtle', 'missed', 'However', 'way', 'screenwriters', 'Josh', 'Jacob', 'Kornbluth', 'John', 'Bellucci', 'illustrate', 'truths', 'concerning', 'sterility', 'absurdities', 'average', '9', '5', 'Perhaps', 'like', 'comic', 'strip', 'Dilbert', ""'ll"", 'see', 'merit', 'film']",Haiku Tunnel

686161,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00005UW7H,Reviewer,"[10, 22]","Office work, especially in this era of computers, multi-functional copy machines, e-mail, voice mail, snail mail and ""temps,"" is territory ripe with satirical possibilities, a vein previously tapped in such films as ""Clockwatchers"" and ""Office Space,"" and very successfully.  This latest addition to the temp/humor pool, however, ""Haiku Tunnel,"" directed by Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth, fails to live up to it's predecessors, and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door, waiting for a chance to sneak in.  Unfortunately for the audience, that chance never comes; so what you get is a nice try, but as the man once said, no cigar.As the narrator/star of the film, Josh Kornbluth (playing Josh Kornbluth), points out in the opening frames (in a monologue delivered directly into the camera), this story is pure fiction, and takes place in the fictional city of ""San Franc'l'isco.""  It's an innovative, if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer, and not all that funny.  It is, however, a harbinger of what is to follow, all of which-- like the disclaimer-- just isn't all that funny.Kornbluth plays Kornbluth, an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a ""temp.""  It's a job that suits him, and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time.  But when he goes to work for a lawyer, Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), he does too good a job on the first day, and Shelby dispatches head secretary Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker) to Kornbluth to persuade him to go ""perm.""  The thought of working full time for the same company, though, initially strikes fear in the heart of Kornbluth, but he caves in and signs on for the position.  He's nervous about it, but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence (which, of course, they would never do with a temp), and if things get too rough, he has seventeen important letters he's typed up-- that now just have to be mailed out-- to fall back on (he's been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part, and he needs that ""something easy to do"" in reserve, in case it all gets to be too much for him).  These are ""important"" letters, however, and by the end of the week, Kornbluth still has them in reserve, on his desk.  And it doesn't take a genius to figure out that when Shelby finds out about it, Kornbluth's days as the fair-haired boy are going to be over.  And quick.The Brothers Kornbluth, who not only directed, but along with John Bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film, should have taken a page out of the Ben Stiller Book of Comedy, where it says ""If you play it straight, they will laugh.""  But, they didn't, and the audience won't.  Because in comedy, even looking at it as objectively as possible, when the main character (as well as most of the supporting characters, in this case) ""Plays"" funny-- as in, he ""knows"" he's being funny-- he never is.  And that's exactly what Kornbluth does here; so rather than being ""funny,"" he comes across as insincere and pretentious, a grievous error in judgment on the part of the Kornbluths, because by allowing it, they sabotaged their own movie.In trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn't work, it comes down to two basic reasons:  The directing, which-- if not necessarily ""bad""-- is at least careless; and secondly, the performances, beginning with that of Josh Kornbluth.  Quite simply, Kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here.  Unlike Stiller, or even Steve Martin-- both of whom use self-deprecating humor very effectively-- Kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light; he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he, the real Kornbluth, is in reality much more clever than Kornbluth the character.  And being unable to get past that does him in, as well as the film.  Rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify, Kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach.  So what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting, and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with, with an inexplicably narrow focus (given the potential of the rich subject matter), it's easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly.The one saving grace of the film is the performance by Warren Keith as Shelby, whose subtle delivery is convincing, and which-- in and of itself-- is fairly humorous.  The effectiveness of it is diminished, however, inasmuch as Keith has to share his scenes with Kornbluth, which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project.Shumaker and Sarah Overman (Julie Faustino) also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances, which are commendable, if not entirely memorable; they at least make their scenes watchable, and Overman even manages to elevate Kornbluth's performance, if only momentarily.  But it's still not enough to save the day or the film.The supporting cast includes Amy Resnick (Mindy), Brian Thorstenson (Clifford), June Lomena (DaVonne), Joe Bellan (Jimmy the Mail Clerk), with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking Harry Shearer, as the Orientation Leader-- a role that begs for an answer to the question, ""What was he thinking when he agreed to this?""  In any work environment, there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone's comedic cannon, and the films depicting said situations will always be with us; the good ones (see paragraph one) may even become classics in their own right.  ""Haiku Tunnel,"" however, will doubtfully remain very long amongst them, for it's destiny lies elsewhere-- in a realm known only as:  ""Obscurity.""",1,A &quot;Temp&quot; Setback for

Yes, he has to live in a small dump of an apartment in the Mission District in ""San Franclisco"" (a `fictional' town, the setting for his `fictional' story, but he actually enjoys his life. Then he accepts a temp assignment working for Bob Shelby (Warren Keith) at the law firm of Schuyler &amp; Mitchell. Josh notices strange things at S &amp; M, but he goes about his assignment. Then Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker), the head Secretary, asks Josh if he wants ""to go perm?"" Josh accepts and everything begins to unravel.""Haiku Tunnel"" is simply one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long, long time.Josh Kornbluth reportedly developed a one-man show called ""Haiku Tunnel"" based on his adventures as a Legal Temp. He and his brother Jacob worked for a long time to turn the play into a film. The film, directed by the Kornbluth Brothers works amazingly well. We follow Josh's adventures as he wades through the bureaucracy of office life and John frequently takes us aside to share his observations.Every character in the film is pitch perfect. If you have ever worked at a law firm, in an office or for a temp agency, you will most likely recognize the people. Bob Shelby is easily one of the funniest characters ever created for a film and Warren Keith is brilliant in bringing the stoic, emotionless lawyer to life. He almost steals every scene he is in. This is quite an accomplishment considering the actor playing against him, Josh Kornbluth, created the character. Keith's monotone is very evocative of a supervisor who wants to do a great job, expects his employees to do a great job, but can't quite summon the will to enforce this desire.Josh Kornbluth is hilarious playing a character that he goes to great pains to try to convince the audience is fictional. He makes frequent observations, which is usually a technique that is sure to annoy me, but his observations are very funny, very accurate and well-timed. He has to deal with the stigma of being a temp, the quick revelation of going perm, his various office workers, office machines, procrastination, artificial environments, desperate office celebrations, security guards and computer professionals who work all hours. There isn't a single joke in the film which doesn't create a laugh.Marlina D'Amore, played by Helen Shumaker, is also perfect. Slightly condescending, finally embracing the role of mother to the office, she walks around with an all-knowing, silent attitude which is simply a marvel to behold. ""Josh, would you like to go... perm?""Mindy, Clifford and DaVonne (Amy Resnick, Brian Thorstenson and June Lomena respectively) are the three other secretaries in the office. Each is a perfect example of a specific type of office worker you have already met. Each is well-thought out and very unique. It is unusual to have this level of detail for the individual characters in any film. These three have been in the office long enough to recognize all of the ins and outs. ""She's a pusher"" and ""Hi, Josh. So we hear you went Perm?"" are just two of their many funny lines.""Haiku Tunnel"" is a rare thing. The pitch perfect, consistently funny and inventive comedy.",5,One Of The Funniest Films I Have Ever Seen,1011139200,"01 16, 2002",2002,3429,"['Josh', 'Kornbluth', 'Josh', 'Kornbluth', 'temp', 'job', 'temp', 'job', 'writing', 'Great', 'American', 'novel', 'perfectly', 'content', 'take', 'jobs', 'because', 'out', 'really', 'good', 'temp', 'also', 'allow', 'freedom', 'concentrate', 'other', 'things', 'Yes', 'live', 'small', 'dump', 'apartment', 'Mission', 'District', 'San', 'Franclisco', 'fictional', 'town', 'setting', 'fictional', 'story', 'actually', 'life', 'Then', 'temp', 'assignment', 'working', 'Bob', 'Shelby', 'Warren', 'Keith', 'law', 'firm', 'Schuyler', 'amp', 'Mitchell', 'Josh', 'notices', 'strange', 'things', 'S', 'amp', 'M', 'assignment', 'Then', 'Marlina', ""D'Amore"", 'Helen', 'Shumaker', 'head', 'Secretary', 'Josh', 'go', 'perm', 'Josh', 'accepts', 'everything', 'begins', 'unravel', 'Haiku', 'Tunnel', 'simply', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'long', 'time.Josh', 'Kornbluth', 'reportedly', 'developed', 'one-man', 'show', 'called', 'Haiku', 'Tunnel', 'based', 'adventures', 'Legal', 'Temp', 'brother', 'Jacob', 'worked', 'long', 'time', 'turn', 'play', 'film', 'film', 'directed', 'Kornbluth', 'Brothers', 'amazingly', 'well', 'follow', 'Josh', 'adventures', 'bureaucracy', 'office', 'life', 'John', 'frequently', 'aside', 'share', 'observations.Every', 'character', 'film', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'have', 'ever', 'worked', 'law', 'firm', 'office', 'temp', 'agency', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'recognize', 'people', 'Bob', 'Shelby', 'easily', 'one', 'funniest', 'characters', 'ever', 'created', 'film', 'Warren', 'Keith', 'brilliant', 'bringing', 'stoic', 'emotionless', 'lawyer', 'life', 'almost', 'scene', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'considering', 'actor', 'playing', 'Josh', 'Kornbluth', 'created', 'character', 'Keith', 'monotone', 'very', 'evocative', 'supervisor', 'who', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'employees', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'summon', 'will', 'enforce', 'desire.Josh', 'Kornbluth', 'hilarious', 'playing', 'character', 'great', 'pains', 'try', 'convince', 'audience', 'fictional', 'frequent', 'observations', 'usually', 'technique', 'sure', 'annoy', 'observations', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'accurate', 'well-timed', 'deal', 'stigma', 'being', 'temp', 'quick', 'revelation', 'going', 'perm', 'various', 'office', 'workers', 'office', 'machines', 'procrastination', 'artificial', 'environments', 'desperate', 'office', 'celebrations', 'security', 'guards', 'computer', 'professionals', 'who', 'work', 'hours', ""n't"", 'single', 'joke', 'film', ""n't"", 'create', 'laugh.Marlina', ""D'Amore"", 'played', 'Helen', 'Shumaker', 'also', 'perfect', 'Slightly', 'condescending', 'finally', 'embracing', 'role', 'mother', 'office', 'all-knowing', 'silent', 'attitude', 'simply', 'marvel', 'behold', 'Josh', 'would', 'like', 'go', 'perm', 'Mindy', 'Clifford', 'DaVonne', 'Amy', 'Resnick', 'Brian', 'Thorstenson', 'June', 'Lomena', 'respectively', 'are', 'three', 'other', 'secretaries', 'office', 'perfect', 'example', 'specific', 'type', 'office', 'worker', 'have', 'already', 'met', 'well-thought', 'very', 'unique', 'unusual', 'have', 'level', 'detail', 'individual', 'characters', 'film', 'three', 'have', 'been', 'office', 'long', 'enough', 'recognize', 'ins', 'outs', 'pusher', 'Hi', 'Josh', 'hear', 'went', 'Perm', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'many', 'funny', 'lines', 'Haiku', 'Tunnel', 'rare', 'thing', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'consistently', 'funny', 'inventive', 'comedy']",Haiku Tunnel
686163,A1WWDFQ8HSKT0,B00005UW7H,Vincent M. Mastronardi,"[8, 8]","As if there were a lot of comedies about office temps.  Actually the last one (and only other one) I remember was called ""Clockwatchers"", which was an indie movie that featured Lisa Kudrow, Toni Collette and Parker Posey.  This one doesn t have as much star power (although there is a scary looking Harry Shearer making a kind of unnecessary cameo that anyone else could have done) but ""Haiku Tunnel"" is that rare indie comedy that you think might be slightly funny when you see it one the new release rack.  It's much better than that!  You know when a movie starts with the Pixies classic ""Debaser"" that something good is coming up.  Josh Kornbluth plays himself (kind of, sort of) in this office comedy of errors.  Josh is temp that often works at law firms and while he like most of us can t stand the 9 to 5, he gets by (his solace is the fact that his bed is waiting for him at home).  Josh get signals that his latest job might be for the devil, so he better do a good job. He is proficient that he is urged to take permanent status on the first day.  He does and that s when things should turn around for this man that lives in the temp zone.  It doesn't as he finds a myriad of excuses to prolong an important task that he was suppose to do right away (the mailing out of 17 very important letters).This movie has to be seen to be believed.  It is filled with witty dialogues (and monologues), real life scenarios and the talent of this cast.  Helen Shumaker (Marlina) is such an excellent comic actor she deserves the Academy Award for Supporting Actress (alas, no nods for this movie).  ""Haiku Tunnel"" is the universal office comedy that is about a loser s loser but he is so real and candid that you can t help but like him and feel his predicament.  I unfortunately bought the video on impulse so I can t talk about the extras on the DVD but the movie is a laugh riot.
