It seems less like a movie and more of an extended TV episode. The major event lacked punch. I didn't feel for the characters. The style of the new Pokemon themselves didn't really appeal to me. I can recommend this for kids who haven't developed real movie standards. Otherwise I'd say buy it cheap. If you don't get this one your DVD collection will not notice the absence.",3,Wasn't Impressed,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,478,"['am', 'fan', 'Pokemon', 'movies', 'tend', 'be', '34', 'hit', 'miss.', '34', 'opinion', 'one', 'miss', 'less', 'movie', 'more', 'extended', 'TV', 'episode', 'major', 'event', 'lacked', 'punch', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'characters', 'style', 'new', 'Pokemon', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'appeal', 'can', 'recommend', 'kids', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'developed', 'real', 'movie', 'standards', 'Otherwise', ""'d"", 'say', 'buy', 'cheap', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'one', 'DVD', 'collection', 'will', 'not', 'notice', 'absence']",Pokémon the Movie 15: Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice
1623186,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B00B83QHV4,E. David Swan,"[2, 2]","The film opens with four Pokemon legendaries playfully battling. These include the ""Swords of Justice"" Cobalion, Terrakion and Virizion as well as the Sword of Justice wannabe Keldeo. Right from the start the animation and action looked better than anything I saw in the disappointing Black/White movie. Keldeo's goal is to become the fourth member of the Swords of Justice but to do this he needs to battle the immensely powerful Boundary Pokemon Kyurem. When the other Swords tell him he's not ready Keldeo defiantly heads out on his own to face the mighty dragon in his factory lair. The battle goes very badly and not only is Keldeo beaten down but when the Swords of Justice attempt a save they are frozen solid and a battered Keldeo is forced to flee. Unfortunately you don't just walk away from a fight with Kyurem and the rest of the movie is Kyurem's relentless pursuit of his diminutive foe in order to finish the battle.Kyurem vs the Swords of Justice has about as simple a plot as one can get. It's almost entirely the fight between two legendaries and Ash Ketchum doesn't even show up until minute 16 of this rather short 66 minute film.  In this case the simplicity of the plot works in the movies favor.  I won't deny that the movie feels very small but it's compact and dense with legendary vs legendary action without a lot of the filler that burdens other Pokemon movies. Inevitably Keldeo is forced into a second and final battle against Kyurem but this time he has the power of friendship behind him which is pretty much the plot of every single Pokemon movie ever made.Having seen the movie once I can't say I have much interest in seeing it again. It was fun and Kyurem is one of the most visually stunning Pokemon ever particularly when he takes on the power of Zekrom or Reshiram but overall it's a rather shallow story and one viewing will satisfy most people. I had to laugh when during Ash's first scene they play a song about friends forever. In Black/White Ash is now travelling with a new pair of friends and besides Pikachu he has all new Pokemon. So much for friends forever. I'm also not a fan of Ash's generation V Pokemon including a Tepig and the goofy Scraggy who spends all his time pulling his pants up. I'm not a huge fan of a lot of the fifth generation Pokemon but this film is almost exclusively about legendaries with the headliner being Keldeo. Keldeo is one of those annoying Pokemon who is almost impossible to get without a cheating device and was a cheap  gimmick Nintendo likes to use to get people in the theater, at least in Japan where the movies still play in theaters. Americans don't even have the luxury to pick up Keldeo at a live event.",3,Very Shallow Movie,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,2695,"['film', 'four', 'Pokemon', 'legendaries', 'playfully', 'battling', 'include', 'Swords', 'Justice', 'Cobalion', 'Terrakion', 'Virizion', 'as', 'well', 'Sword', 'Justice', 'wannabe', 'Keldeo', 'Right', 'start', 'animation', 'action', 'looked', 'better', 'anything', 'saw', 'disappointing', 'Black/White', 'movie', 'Keldeo', 'goal', 'become', 'fourth', 'member', 'Swords', 'Justice', 'do', 'battle', 'immensely', 'powerful', 'Boundary', 'Pokemon', 'Kyurem', 'When', 'other', 'Swords', 'tell', 'not', 'ready', 'Keldeo', 'defiantly', 'out', 'own', 'face', 'mighty', 'dragon', 'factory', 'lair', 'battle', 'very', 'badly', 'not', 'only', 'Keldeo', 'beaten', 'down', 'when', 'Swords', 'Justice', 'attempt', 'save', 'are', 'frozen', 'solid', 'battered', 'Keldeo', 'forced', 'flee', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'walk', 'away', 'fight', 'Kyurem', 'rest', 'movie', 'Kyurem', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'diminutive', 'foe', 'order', 'finish', 'battle.Kyurem', 'Swords', 'Justice', 'about', 'as', 'simple', 'plot', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'almost', 'entirely', 'fight', 'two', 'legendaries', 'Ash', 'Ketchum', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'up', 'minute', '16', 'rather', 'short', '66', 'minute', 'film', 'case', 'simplicity', 'plot', 'movies', 'favor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'movie', 'very', 'small', 'compact', 'dense', 'legendary', 'vs', 'legendary', 'action', 'lot', 'filler', 'other', 'Pokemon', 'movies', 'Inevitably', 'Keldeo', 'forced', 'second', 'final', 'battle', 'Kyurem', 'time', 'power', 'friendship', 'pretty', 'much', 'plot', 'single', 'Pokemon', 'movie', 'ever', 'made.Having', 'seen', 'movie', 'once', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'have', 'much', 'interest', 'seeing', 'again', 'was', 'fun', 'Kyurem', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Pokemon', 'ever', 'particularly', 'when', 'power', 'Zekrom', 'Reshiram', 'overall', 'rather', 'shallow', 'story', 'one', 'viewing', 'will', 'satisfy', 'most', 'people', 'had', 'laugh', 'when', 'Ash', 'first', 'scene', 'play', 'song', 'friends', 'forever', 'Black/White', 'Ash', 'now', 'travelling', 'new', 'pair', 'friends', 'besides', 'Pikachu', 'new', 'Pokemon', 'So', 'much', 'friends', 'forever', ""'m"", 'also', 'not', 'fan', 'Ash', 'generation', 'V', 'Pokemon', 'including', 'Tepig', 'goofy', 'Scraggy', 'who', 'time', 'pulling', 'pants', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'lot', 'fifth', 'generation', 'Pokemon', 'film', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'legendaries', 'headliner', 'being', 'Keldeo', 'Keldeo', 'one', 'annoying', 'Pokemon', 'who', 'almost', 'impossible', 'get', 'cheating', 'device', 'was', 'cheap', 'gimmick', 'Nintendo', 'use', 'get', 'people', 'theater', 'least', 'Japan', 'where', 'movies', 'still', 'play', 'theaters', 'Americans', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'luxury', 'pick', 'up', 'Keldeo', 'live', 'event']",Pokémon the Movie 15: Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice

1623188,A1OUGHYC0NCU1S,B00B83QHV4,Ryan V.,"[0, 0]","I really do not get Viz Media. When this movie aired in Japan, it aired with a Pikachu Short, Meloetta's Sparkling Recital, I believe was the title. The movie is only 1hr 11 min. I believe all the cut out parts are in the movie that were previously not seen when aired on Cartoon Network. My main point is, how are we going to buy the Pikachu Short? I know I normally don't like them, but if they were aired with the movie, then why not PUT them with the movie? They did it with Pokemon Ranger and The Temple of the Sea (movie 9, they even made it on its own disc so it was a 2 disc copy).The only way to watch the Short is to download the Pokemon TV app and watch it there. Who knows how long it will be there. I am very disappointed. I give this 4 stars because I like the movie, but with no Short, it's like you are buying 2/3 of the movie. I was lucky enough to see this movie in a certain store, today, 4 days before it officially gets released (on April 2).So people who want this movie and are curious about if the Short comes with, no. You get the options: Play Movie/Stereo, 5.1/ Set-Up/Scene Selection/ and the trailer for the movie.So looks like for the next movie (Genesect vs Mewtwo), we won't get the Short released with it as well.",4,"Alright movie, no Pikachu Short.",1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,1246,"['really', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'Viz', 'Media', 'When', 'movie', 'aired', 'Japan', 'aired', 'Pikachu', 'Short', 'Meloetta', 'Sparkling', 'Recital', 'believe', 'was', 'title', 'movie', 'only', '1hr', '11', 'min', 'believe', 'cut', 'out', 'parts', 'are', 'movie', 'were', 'previously', 'not', 'seen', 'when', 'aired', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'main', 'point', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'buy', 'Pikachu', 'Short', 'know', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'were', 'aired', 'movie', 'then', 'why', 'not', 'PUT', 'movie', 'did', 'Pokemon', 'Ranger', 'Temple', 'Sea', 'movie', '9', 'even', 'made', 'own', 'disc', 'was', '2', 'disc', 'copy', 'only', 'way', 'watch', 'Short', 'download', 'Pokemon', 'TV', 'app', 'watch', 'there', 'Who', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'am', 'very', 'disappointed', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'like', 'movie', 'Short', 'are', 'buying', '2/3', 'movie', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'movie', 'certain', 'store', 'today', '4', 'days', 'officially', 'released', 'April', '2', '.So', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'movie', 'are', 'curious', 'Short', 'get', 'options', 'Play', 'Movie/Stereo', '5.1/', 'Set-Up/Scene', 'Selection/', 'trailer', 'movie.So', 'looks', 'next', 'movie', 'Genesect', 'vs', 'Mewtwo', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'Short', 'released', 'as', 'well']",Pokémon the Movie 15: Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice
