Some of the specific anecdotes here - the woman, for example, who is apparently told by her doctor that the reasons for her mystery illness is purely psychological and likely the result of her not getting attention from men - are so distressing they are almost too much to take. What this film does well, it does very well - it puts a face to this still mysterious but potentially devastating illness. It also fully and openly exposes audiences to the depth of pain and suffering this disease has caused people and should be viewed by anyone who dismisses Lyme as some sort of fad disease. However, I personally think it is worth considering the fact that illnesses and conditions - everything from pellagra to Legionnaire's to autism to AIDS to drug addiction - are often misunderstood for years before the proper treatment is discovered, if at all. And in that space and time where a cure is elusive there will always be unscrupulous and/or wrong-headed doctors there to exploit a market of desperate and fearful people. This is just a fact of history and a fact of life. In watching this film and the occasionally hagiographic light it casts on outlier doctors challenging the inadequate orthodoxy of today's treatment, I thought to myself, if 15 years from now one of these doctors is found to have peddled ineffective and even harmful treatments to  patients it would not surprise me.Like anything else, buyer beware.",3,An Important Film,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,1566,"['Skin', 'powerfully', 'made', 'film', 'much', 'needed', 'story', 'misdiagnosis', 'often', 'lack', 'diagnosis', 'Lyme', 'Disease', 'specific', 'anecdotes', 'here', 'woman', 'example', 'who', 'apparently', 'told', 'doctor', 'reasons', 'mystery', 'illness', 'purely', 'psychological', 'likely', 'result', 'not', 'getting', 'attention', 'men', 'are', 'so', 'distressing', 'are', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'take', 'What', 'film', 'well', 'very', 'well', 'face', 'still', 'mysterious', 'potentially', 'devastating', 'illness', 'also', 'fully', 'openly', 'audiences', 'depth', 'pain', 'suffering', 'disease', 'caused', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'anyone', 'who', 'Lyme', 'sort', 'fad', 'disease', 'However', 'personally', 'think', 'worth', 'considering', 'fact', 'illnesses', 'conditions', 'everything', 'pellagra', 'Legionnaire', 'autism', 'AIDS', 'drug', 'addiction', 'are', 'often', 'misunderstood', 'years', 'proper', 'treatment', 'discovered', 'space', 'time', 'where', 'cure', 'elusive', 'there', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'unscrupulous', 'and/or', 'wrong-headed', 'doctors', 'there', 'exploit', 'market', 'desperate', 'fearful', 'people', 'just', 'fact', 'history', 'fact', 'life', 'watching', 'film', 'occasionally', 'hagiographic', 'light', 'outlier', 'doctors', 'challenging', 'inadequate', 'orthodoxy', 'today', 'treatment', 'thought', 'myself', '15', 'years', 'now', 'one', 'doctors', 'found', 'have', 'peddled', 'ineffective', 'even', 'harmful', 'treatments', 'patients', 'would', 'not', 'surprise', 'me.Like', 'anything', 'else', 'buyer', 'beware']",N/A

It is very disheartening to see what is being done to doctors who are trying to help their patients and that some doctors are telling patients the symptoms are psychosomatic.

A routine, patch you up and go home situation, turned into a life-or-death 1 month hospitalization that horror stories are made from and years of recovery. It scars you for life, but it makes you tougher as a human being. Those in this video are survivors, both physically and psychologically and need to be commended. The comment in the video of the lady taking 4hrs to get to one side of the house to another (showing her determination of her dignity and strength), I relate to trying to walk again, starting with using my toes to push a wheelchair (loss 80% muscle tone in my leg). Or to even eat with boarded up hands, and trying to suck Jello threw a straw (the staff sure wasn't going to help feed me anyway...don't you love hospitals that can deliver a food tray in ICU, but you only have 2 fingers on each hand to use and they won't hold a fork even???).Yeah, that's the survivors in this video, hero/ines of medicine. I admire everyone one of them of learning their personal story in combating something that suppose to be so easy to treat, yet ""the system"" can't/won't treat properly. The ""system"" is more concerned about preserving their back sides.Same BS they did with Halton Arp in Astrophysics too, they just do with MDs, pulling their licenses to protect their self-interests and reputations. The docs here aren't quacks, they use conventional medicine and found long-term antibiotics works for these patients. Simple deduction medicine, just like off-label prescribing of medications to treat conditions. That's what these doctors are doing, not selling snake oil. No fringe. No ""alternative"" herbal treatments. Antibiotics over time -- and the politics in this mess? Do so, and we'll target the doctors.Is this another Tuskeegee medical experiment (same syphilis background. Trying to complete what wasn't complete, yet)? -_-Any fighter out there who came back off the mat should watch this video. It's inspirational, educational and shows the will and spirit of those determined to do what is right.

Lyme is difficult to diagnose, but the presence of ticks/tick bits is pretty definitive.  Many physicians don't have the time to study all of the areas of medicine in an ongoing fashion and rely heavily on professional societies/studies.  And sometimes those societies and studies are either inadequate or just wrong.  this DVD follows several people who struggled with the disease and even more frustrating, with the profession that often did not take them seriously.As a retired mid-level provider (nurse practitioner) I am more than familiar with the difficulties of really hearing what the patient is telling us and following up in an ethical and effective manner.  The time committment for the practitioner is often overwhelming, but it is a necessary part of effective, ethical practice.I have good friends whose experience validates those on this DVD, and I have had my own experience of being blown off by my primary care physician, ""because the studies say you don't need to . . .
