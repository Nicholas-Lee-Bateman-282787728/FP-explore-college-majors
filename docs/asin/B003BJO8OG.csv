When TV actors are so profound, famous or infamous, we cannot see them playing anything but those characters.  So, immediately they are not cast well for the film.  Everybody loves Raymond's mom, Doris Roberts is a love interest of Grandfather Joe played by Andy Griffith.  Opie's real brother Clint Howard and his father Lance Howard appear.  Also, another character Geoffrey Owens from Cosby show appears.It's sad to see that our beloved Andy Griffith has aged, but more shocking is that he plays the character of a senior man who soon discovers that his sexual virility is raised with the enhancement of Viagra, (unbeknown) to him at the time.  Then, he is in bed with another senior, played by Seinfeld's mom, Liz Sheridan.  And it is clear that he gets a b*job, loves it, and talks about it, especially when he said ""she took off her dentures"" !!The premise of this film is finding love.  A young man, David teaches his grandfather  Joe, how to get the women while  he, (David) is trying his hand at it too.  Grandfather Joe lost his wife two years prior and is feeling lonely in the nursing home, can't get it up anymore until things change.The romantic comedy is amusing, simple and with many sexual references.  Sheriff Andy Taylor in bed with a woman, Seinfeld's mom??  Who woulda thunk?

Only without silly teens in high school. It didn't look like such an enjoyable film from the teaser-trailers--but boy, did I love this movie. Also...don't confuse this with the four or five others that share the same title. This is a 2008 offering and miraculously, there was no other film by the same title released that year or since then.David Mitchell (a strangely effeminate Paul Campbell) is a raging 'player', an almost sexually incontinent ladies' man. With essentially little life outside his dad's (hilarious Clint Howard) car dealership, what has he got to lose chasing the babes? Except that David's Grandpa Joe (Andy Griffith) won't forgive him for taking the job and sticking grandpa in a super-fine condominium.This is a lapse that makes no sense in the story...but David visits his Grandpa Joe, who is despondent and threatens suicide because he's a widower. David offers to teach Grandpa Joe ""rules of the game"". What ensues is hilarious, though thoughtful, comedy with David trying to get his grandfather a girlfriend. First at the bar, then in a preciously side-splitting scene at the gym. Meanwhile David is tackling his first true love with Julie (a charming Marla Sokoloff).The tale has an incredible turn that I won't spoil--but it is so fun to see David and his grandfather gradually changing into one another, David absorbing his grandpa's wisdom and grandpa becoming a bit of a rake. The woman of grandpa's dreams, Rose (legendary Doris Roberts) happens to be Julie's granddaughter. What each man will learn here will astonish you, though portions of this happy and truly fun movie are predictable. In actuality, I haven't seen a script as funny, moving and original as this, for a long time.What I don't get is the cold shoulder Andy Griffith always gets. He's done a few hilarious bit parts in the past, but this film centers on him. One might say he's actually the romantic lead in this film--and he gives Betty White a run for her money for her widely hyped, great performance in THE PROPOSAL. I'm getting tired of Andy Griffith's talents being treated like a video ghost.Well, the studio's behind him: the website offers a ""dancing grandpa"", featuring Andy Griffith busting some pretty good moves for a guy in his mid-80s. (He's just a couple years younger than Betty White, but Griffith does show his age a lot more.) The dancing Griffith is featured during the credits and it is a hoot and a half!This film may not merit instant classic classification, and you may not want to have it in your video collection...but watch it. You won't regret a moment of it and you may even deem it a classic.",4,The Griffith VS White Bout,1273881600,"05 15, 2010",2010,2740,"['One', 'thing', 'must', 'say', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'something', 'late', 'John', 'Hughes', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'Only', 'silly', 'teens', 'high', 'school', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'teaser-trailers', 'boy', 'did', 'love', 'movie', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'four', 'five', 'others', 'share', 'same', 'title', '2008', 'offering', 'miraculously', 'was', 'other', 'film', 'same', 'title', 'released', 'year', 'then.David', 'Mitchell', 'strangely', 'effeminate', 'Paul', 'Campbell', 'raging', ""'player"", 'almost', 'sexually', 'incontinent', 'ladies', 'man', 'essentially', 'little', 'life', 'dad', 'hilarious', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'car', 'dealership', 'what', 'got', 'lose', 'chasing', 'babes', 'David', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'taking', 'job', 'sticking', 'grandpa', 'super-fine', 'condominium.This', 'lapse', 'sense', 'story', 'David', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'who', 'despondent', 'suicide', 'widower', 'David', 'teach', 'Grandpa', 'Joe', 'rules', 'game', 'What', 'hilarious', 'though', 'thoughtful', 'comedy', 'David', 'trying', 'get', 'grandfather', 'girlfriend', 'First', 'bar', 'then', 'preciously', 'side-splitting', 'scene', 'gym', 'Meanwhile', 'David', 'tackling', 'first', 'true', 'love', 'Julie', 'charming', 'Marla', 'Sokoloff', '.The', 'tale', 'incredible', 'turn', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'so', 'fun', 'see', 'David', 'grandfather', 'gradually', 'changing', 'one', 'David', 'absorbing', 'grandpa', 'wisdom', 'grandpa', 'becoming', 'bit', 'rake', 'woman', 'grandpa', 'dreams', 'Rose', 'legendary', 'Doris', 'Roberts', 'be', 'Julie', 'granddaughter', 'What', 'man', 'will', 'learn', 'here', 'will', 'astonish', 'portions', 'happy', 'truly', 'fun', 'movie', 'are', 'predictable', 'actuality', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'script', 'funny', 'moving', 'original', 'long', 'time.What', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'always', 'done', 'few', 'hilarious', 'bit', 'parts', 'past', 'film', 'centers', 'One', 'might', 'say', 'actually', 'romantic', 'lead', 'film', 'Betty', 'White', 'run', 'money', 'widely', 'hyped', 'great', 'performance', 'PROPOSAL', ""'m"", 'getting', 'tired', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'talents', 'being', 'treated', 'video', 'ghost.Well', 'studio', 'website', 'dancing', 'grandpa', 'featuring', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'busting', 'pretty', 'good', 'moves', 'guy', 'mid-80s', 'just', 'couple', 'years', 'younger', 'Betty', 'White', 'Griffith', 'show', 'age', 'lot', 'more', 'dancing', 'Griffith', 'featured', 'credits', 'hoot', 'half', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'merit', 'instant', 'classic', 'classification', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'have', 'video', 'collection', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'moment', 'may', 'even', 'deem', 'classic']",N/A

1335689,A1VOPP2OFITP7D,B003BJO8OG,June Bug,"[1, 1]","I wasted one hour of my life before I bailed on this film.  Though billed as a comedy, it failed miserably for multiple reasons.  All these actors should be embarrassed for taking money for this trash.First of all, it is supposed to be a romantic comedy but in many ways, you've watched this movie dozens of time, as the script was unoriginal and there were no laugh out loud moments.  It's main premise is that by being more manipulative than the prey (females), allows the male (real men (respectful, honest and emotionally mature) would not do this) to have complete control in the relationship.  Control should be gained through any means necessary, which includes whatever deceptive means on the person targeted.Paul Campbell plays a playboy. He works as a successful car salesman, and he consistently manages  to exceed other sales people in profitability on car sales at the dealership.  How, because he lies the best!  He teaches his Grandpa (Andy Griffith) to find a girlfriend after not dating for 60 years.  Although, Griffith is successful by applying some of these techniques.  He is ultimately tricked when the woman, who likes him and is very direct about her sexual desires slips him a Viagra in his alcoholic drink (great teach children that it's okay to lie and drug unsuspecting people - what if Grandpa had a heart condition?)!  Of course, they are soon in bed doing the ""deed"", when this woman does some ""new"" things on Grandpa -I stopped the DVD. Meanwhile, Paul is having a much more difficult time in conquering his newest target using his ""tricks"", because she is more adept at using the same techniques on him without his realization.So, the joke is apparently on the men, who manage to be ""outplayed"" by the women in deceiving.  How flattering to women...not.This movie mocks honesty and true love in nearly every scene.  Its key plot (messages), is do whatever you want to get what you want, this is the premise of Humanism.  Each character is operating according to these principles.  Paul's best-friend, Omar is a fellow car sales man, spends his evenings operating as Campbell's wing man, although he is married and lying to his wife stating he is playing poker, when he is cruising bars with Paul.  Omar's wife traps him repeatedly in this lie, he has no consequences and he talks about how dull marriage is.  Gee, marriage which has been practiced for millenniums by many cultures is so old fashioned, its ""boring"".  I guess being single isn't lonely if you are always pursuing the next target, er, I mean person...It's true ""Art imitates life"" in business and the dating world.  Perhaps, this kind of thinking, which started gaining acceptance in the 1980's, it is most likely why more than 1/2 of American marriages end in divorce.  Serial monogamy is now becoming the norm, instead of the rarity it once was.  People now give priority to their wants over those of their partner's, co-workers, children and family members.  Though many call this being fulfilled or achieving goals, at the root, it is completely selfish and self-centered. It may be the reason, so many people, both single and married can't find a positive relationship.  Many discover after marrying or investing years into another person, that neither are who the other one thought, because one or both fail portray themselves realistically; as reflected in comments such as ""she isn't the girl I married"" this disappointment and disillusionment in romantic relationships becomes a pattern.If you find lying and selfishness funny, then don't just rent it, buy it!However, if you want to have your children fulfilling personal and career relationships, skip this movie that salutes selfishness, lying and manipulation as a means to an end; that  controlling others by deception despite the impact on another's emotional health is not your responsibility.The only positive I can say is that I checked it out of the library, so all I'm out of my time watching and writing this review.",1,A Big Fat Raspberry to Golden Rule,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,3984,"['wasted', 'one', 'hour', 'life', 'bailed', 'film', 'Though', 'billed', 'comedy', 'failed', 'miserably', 'multiple', 'reasons', 'actors', 'should', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'taking', 'money', 'trash.First', 'supposed', 'be', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'many', 'ways', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'time', 'script', 'was', 'unoriginal', 'were', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'moments', 'main', 'premise', 'being', 'more', 'manipulative', 'prey', 'females', 'male', 'real', 'men', 'respectful', 'honest', 'emotionally', 'mature', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'have', 'complete', 'control', 'relationship', 'Control', 'should', 'be', 'gained', 'means', 'necessary', 'deceptive', 'means', 'person', 'targeted.Paul', 'Campbell', 'playboy', 'successful', 'car', 'salesman', 'consistently', 'exceed', 'other', 'sales', 'people', 'profitability', 'car', 'sales', 'dealership', 'How', 'best', 'Grandpa', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'find', 'girlfriend', 'not', 'dating', '60', 'years', 'Griffith', 'successful', 'applying', 'techniques', 'ultimately', 'tricked', 'when', 'woman', 'who', 'very', 'direct', 'sexual', 'desires', 'Viagra', 'alcoholic', 'drink', 'great', 'teach', 'children', 'okay', 'lie', 'drug', 'unsuspecting', 'people', 'what', 'Grandpa', 'had', 'heart', 'condition', 'course', 'are', 'soon', 'bed', 'doing', 'deed', 'when', 'woman', 'new', 'things', 'Grandpa', '-I', 'stopped', 'DVD', 'Meanwhile', 'Paul', 'having', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'time', 'conquering', 'newest', 'target', 'using', 'tricks', 'more', 'adept', 'using', 'same', 'techniques', 'realization.So', 'joke', 'apparently', 'men', 'who', 'manage', 'be', 'outplayed', 'women', 'deceiving', 'How', 'flattering', 'women', 'not.This', 'movie', 'mocks', 'honesty', 'true', 'love', 'nearly', 'scene', 'key', 'plot', 'messages', 'do', 'want', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'premise', 'Humanism', 'character', 'operating', 'according', 'principles', 'Paul', 'best-friend', 'Omar', 'fellow', 'car', 'sales', 'man', 'evenings', 'operating', 'Campbell', 'wing', 'man', 'married', 'lying', 'wife', 'stating', 'playing', 'poker', 'when', 'cruising', 'bars', 'Paul', 'Omar', 'wife', 'traps', 'repeatedly', 'lie', 'consequences', 'how', 'dull', 'marriage', 'Gee', 'marriage', 'been', 'practiced', 'millenniums', 'many', 'cultures', 'so', 'old', 'fashioned', 'boring', 'guess', 'being', 'single', ""n't"", 'lonely', 'are', 'always', 'pursuing', 'next', 'target', 'er', 'mean', 'person', 'true', 'Art', 'life', 'business', 'dating', 'world', 'Perhaps', 'kind', 'thinking', 'started', 'gaining', 'acceptance', '1980', 'most', 'likely', 'why', 'more', '1/2', 'American', 'marriages', 'end', 'divorce', 'Serial', 'monogamy', 'now', 'becoming', 'norm', 'instead', 'rarity', 'once', 'was', 'People', 'now', 'give', 'priority', 'partner', 'co-workers', 'children', 'family', 'members', 'many', 'call', 'being', 'fulfilled', 'achieving', 'goals', 'root', 'completely', 'selfish', 'self-centered', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'single', 'married', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'positive', 'relationship', 'Many', 'discover', 'marrying', 'investing', 'years', 'person', 'are', 'who', 'other', 'one', 'thought', 'one', 'fail', 'portray', 'realistically', 'reflected', 'comments', 'such', ""n't"", 'girl', 'married', 'disappointment', 'disillusionment', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'pattern.If', 'find', 'lying', 'selfishness', 'funny', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'rent', 'buy', 'However', 'want', 'have', 'children', 'fulfilling', 'personal', 'career', 'relationships', 'skip', 'movie', 'selfishness', 'lying', 'manipulation', 'means', 'end', 'controlling', 'others', 'deception', 'impact', 'emotional', 'health', 'not', 'responsibility.The', 'only', 'positive', 'can', 'say', 'checked', 'library', ""'m"", 'time', 'watching', 'writing', 'review']",N/A
