914161,A2BVNU568PB02J,B0009W5IQ0,Amazon Customer,"[20, 23]","This movie is never boring, superficial or pretentious. If you want boring, supeficial and pretentious just go see any of the Matrix sequels.This film has also been described as a character study, but I think it is very much more than that. It the story of the quest, common to most people, to find something authentic within the all to often pointless conditions of modern life. The key images are the huge mountain of coal slag behind Shultze's garden and house and the repeated image of the silent, relentless windmill. The mountain of slag is the coal waste which Shultze has spend most of his existence mining and which will eventually cause his death from lung disease; the windmill represents the ceaseless passage of time, which is indifferent to how well or how poorly we spend our days between the beginning and the end which it provides for us. Together they point to the absurdity of his (and our) existence. The character Laurent shows the true way to live within this rather ruthless reality. She is a contrast to his catatonic mother, her roommate in the nursing home.For whatever reason Cajun music quite suddenly touches something within Shultze and sparks his quest for something better; the rest of the film is about his rather uncertain journey to realize this odd hint of something authentic. What he finds along the way are good relationships, and many other people who are seeking, each in their own way, the same thing (e.g. the flamenco-dancing barmaid, the motorcross passions of his retired friend, the ill-tempered poet/switchman). Although Shultze is misunderstood sometimes, on the whole people are more helpful to him than hurtful. Eventually he finds a brief taste of the authentic life he is seeking, albeit just in time.We see so few movies that actually try to quietly remind us of something important that we should try to appreciate them when they do come along. This is a great film, which is very cinematic, well directed and very consistent. The acting is so good it is hard to understand it as acting at all. It is sad that some who view this film will not understand it or how good it really is because their expectations of film are so conditioned by the hollywood blockbuster machine. Even more saddly, the very people who miss the point of movies like this one are those who most need to understand them. It finally comes down to a question of whether you think film should just distract us from our own absurdity, or actually help us find our way out of it.",5,"This movie is never boring, superficial or pretentious.",1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,2503,"['movie', 'never', 'boring', 'superficial', 'pretentious', 'want', 'boring', 'supeficial', 'pretentious', 'just', 'go', 'see', 'Matrix', 'sequels.This', 'film', 'also', 'been', 'described', 'character', 'study', 'think', 'very', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'quest', 'common', 'most', 'people', 'find', 'something', 'authentic', 'often', 'pointless', 'conditions', 'modern', 'life', 'key', 'images', 'are', 'huge', 'mountain', 'coal', 'slag', 'Shultze', 'garden', 'house', 'repeated', 'image', 'silent', 'relentless', 'windmill', 'mountain', 'slag', 'coal', 'waste', 'Shultze', 'spend', 'most', 'existence', 'mining', 'will', 'eventually', 'cause', 'death', 'lung', 'disease', 'windmill', 'ceaseless', 'passage', 'time', 'indifferent', 'how', 'well', 'how', 'poorly', 'spend', 'days', 'beginning', 'end', 'Together', 'point', 'absurdity', 'existence', 'character', 'Laurent', 'true', 'way', 'live', 'rather', 'ruthless', 'reality', 'contrast', 'catatonic', 'mother', 'roommate', 'nursing', 'home.For', 'reason', 'Cajun', 'music', 'quite', 'suddenly', 'something', 'Shultze', 'sparks', 'quest', 'something', 'better', 'rest', 'film', 'rather', 'uncertain', 'journey', 'realize', 'odd', 'hint', 'something', 'authentic', 'What', 'way', 'are', 'good', 'relationships', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'seeking', 'own', 'way', 'same', 'thing', 'e.g', 'flamenco-dancing', 'barmaid', 'motorcross', 'passions', 'retired', 'friend', 'ill-tempered', 'poet/switchman', 'Shultze', 'misunderstood', 'sometimes', 'whole', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'helpful', 'hurtful', 'Eventually', 'brief', 'taste', 'authentic', 'life', 'seeking', 'albeit', 'just', 'time.We', 'see', 'so', 'few', 'movies', 'actually', 'try', 'quietly', 'remind', 'something', 'important', 'should', 'try', 'appreciate', 'when', 'do', 'come', 'along', 'great', 'film', 'very', 'cinematic', 'well', 'directed', 'very', 'consistent', 'acting', 'so', 'good', 'hard', 'understand', 'acting', 'sad', 'who', 'view', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'good', 'really', 'expectations', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'conditioned', 'hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'machine', 'Even', 'more', 'saddly', 'very', 'people', 'who', 'miss', 'point', 'movies', 'one', 'are', 'who', 'most', 'need', 'understand', 'finally', 'down', 'question', 'think', 'film', 'should', 'just', 'distract', 'own', 'absurdity', 'actually', 'help', 'find', 'way']",N/A

There is very little action, and very little dialogue, but Schultze became an endearing character as the film progressed.

And from the bigoted, narrow minded town where he came from, Schultze found a generous, happy, uncomplicated people.  That these people are the soul of America was made evident in this story of Germans and by Germans.  They really do like what they find here.

914164,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0009W5IQ0,C. O. DeRiemer,"[5, 5]","If you like sweet-natured movies with unlikely lead characters, particularly when they find themselves breaking out of old habits, you should like the German film Schultze Gets the Blues. It's the first film from director Michael Schorr and he brings it off with style.Herr Schultze (Horst Krause) is a heavy set man, probably in his late fifties, who with two friends has been eased into retirement at the commercial salt mine he has worked at for years. Calling Schultze portly would do poor justice to his sizable belly. He's not flabby; he's earned those inches through hard work and plenty of beer. He lives alone and has never thought much about fancy ideas like life. Now, he takes afternoon naps, drinks beer with his two friends, washes his garden trolls and continues to play the accordion at polka parties. He's a slow moving, slow talking, deliberate man. Life is just there, nothing is happening in it, and Schultze is slowly being bored to death without realizing it. He just continues to take each day at its own pace.Then one night he turns the radio dial at home and suddenly hears a fast, strange style of accordion playing he's never heard before. He's come across a broadcast of Louisiana zydeco music. He listens, puzzled. He turns the radio off and starts to go back to bed, then turns and switches the music on again. He listens some more. He tries to figure out the music he's listening to. He turns the radio off again, heads back to bed, but then stops and puts on his accordion. He picks out the tune, then plays it faster and faster, trying to match the zydeco beat. Herr Schultze doesn't know it yet but he has just changed his life.Before long Schultze is playing his zydeco song before puzzled polka audiences. He finds a recipe for jambalaya and cooks it for his two best friends, who've never had such a spicy dish before. Schultze smiles approvingly as they keep eating and drink more beer. He gets part time jobs to earn money for a trip to bayou country in the States. And he wins a contest which will give him enough money to go to his town's sister city in America, New Braunfels, Texas, to compete in a music festival. Schultze gets there, listens to the others and realizes he's out of his league. Instead of going home to spend more time polishing the garden gnomes and taking naps in the afternoon, he buys a small blue boat with an enclosed cabin and sets out from coastal Texas into Louisiana bayou territory. Schultze can speak probably no more than a dozen words of English. He also is one of the most sincere, innocent and non-threatening people you'll ever meet. Schultze meets people he never thought of meeting yet somehow always wanted to. Old men playing dominos in a friendly bar in Moulton, Texas. A Czech band made up of cheerful Americans on the Texas gulf coast. Middle-aged cajuns dancing to a zydeco beat in a bayou bar. A woman and her daughter on a boat who give him a glass of water and invite him to stay for a creole lunch of crab and shrimp. The postcards and pictures he sends back to his friends bemuse them. Schultze also finds a contentment that we share with him.The movie takes its time. There is no flashy cutting. The director isn't afraid of setting up his camera and simply letting a scene unfold. The first half of the movie when Schultze is at his home can sometimes seem as slow-moving as Schultze himself, but stay with it. Once you get into the rhythm of the movie, it works. There is little dialogue, especially when Schultze gets to Texas, just the efforts of a well-meaning man to be understood, and of the efforts of well-meaning Texans, Creoles and Cajuns to understand him. The movie has a dead-pan sense of humor about it at times. It can be poignant but it's not sad. And even the ending is not too sentimental. The movie is well photographed, especially the long, gray days in Schultze's home town and the lush, bayou landscapes that make up the last half of the film.The DVD transfer is just fine. The only significant extra is a commentary, in German with subtitles, by the director. For those who like quirky, small-scale films, Schultze Gets the Blues fits right in with two other fine movies, Bagdad Cafe and The Man Without a Past. All three are worth having.",4,"A fine movie for those who like small, quirky films with unusual and appealing lead characters",1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,4254,"['like', 'sweet-natured', 'movies', 'unlikely', 'lead', 'characters', 'particularly', 'when', 'find', 'breaking', 'old', 'habits', 'should', 'like', 'German', 'film', 'Schultze', 'Blues', 'first', 'film', 'director', 'Michael', 'Schorr', 'off', 'style.Herr', 'Schultze', 'Horst', 'Krause', 'heavy', 'set', 'man', 'probably', 'late', 'fifties', 'who', 'two', 'friends', 'been', 'eased', 'retirement', 'commercial', 'salt', 'mine', 'worked', 'years', 'Calling', 'Schultze', 'portly', 'would', 'do', 'poor', 'justice', 'sizable', 'belly', 'not', 'flabby', 'earned', 'inches', 'hard', 'work', 'plenty', 'beer', 'alone', 'never', 'thought', 'much', 'fancy', 'ideas', 'life', 'Now', 'afternoon', 'naps', 'drinks', 'beer', 'two', 'friends', 'garden', 'trolls', 'play', 'accordion', 'polka', 'parties', 'slow', 'moving', 'slow', 'talking', 'deliberate', 'man', 'Life', 'just', 'there', 'nothing', 'happening', 'Schultze', 'slowly', 'being', 'bored', 'death', 'realizing', 'just', 'take', 'day', 'own', 'pace.Then', 'one', 'night', 'radio', 'dial', 'home', 'suddenly', 'fast', 'strange', 'style', 'accordion', 'playing', 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'come', 'broadcast', 'Louisiana', 'zydeco', 'music', 'puzzled', 'radio', 'go', 'back', 'bed', 'then', 'music', 'again', 'more', 'figure', 'out', 'music', 'listening', 'radio', 'off', 'again', 'heads', 'back', 'bed', 'then', 'stops', 'puts', 'accordion', 'out', 'tune', 'then', 'faster', 'faster', 'trying', 'match', 'zydeco', 'beat', 'Herr', 'Schultze', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'just', 'changed', 'life.Before', 'long', 'Schultze', 'playing', 'zydeco', 'song', 'puzzled', 'polka', 'audiences', 'recipe', 'jambalaya', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'such', 'spicy', 'dish', 'Schultze', 'approvingly', 'keep', 'eating', 'drink', 'more', 'beer', 'part', 'time', 'jobs', 'earn', 'money', 'trip', 'bayou', 'country', 'States', 'contest', 'will', 'give', 'enough', 'money', 'go', 'town', 'sister', 'city', 'America', 'New', 'Braunfels', 'Texas', 'compete', 'music', 'festival', 'Schultze', 'there', 'others', 'league', 'Instead', 'going', 'home', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'polishing', 'garden', 'gnomes', 'taking', 'naps', 'afternoon', 'small', 'blue', 'boat', 'enclosed', 'cabin', 'sets', 'out', 'coastal', 'Texas', 'Louisiana', 'bayou', 'territory', 'Schultze', 'can', 'speak', 'probably', 'more', 'dozen', 'words', 'English', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'sincere', 'innocent', 'non-threatening', 'people', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'meet', 'Schultze', 'people', 'never', 'thought', 'meeting', 'yet', 'somehow', 'always', 'wanted', 'Old', 'men', 'playing', 'dominos', 'friendly', 'bar', 'Moulton', 'Texas', 'Czech', 'band', 'made', 'cheerful', 'Americans', 'Texas', 'gulf', 'coast', 'Middle-aged', 'cajuns', 'dancing', 'zydeco', 'beat', 'bayou', 'bar', 'woman', 'daughter', 'boat', 'who', 'give', 'glass', 'water', 'invite', 'stay', 'creole', 'lunch', 'crab', 'shrimp', 'postcards', 'pictures', 'back', 'friends', 'bemuse', 'Schultze', 'also', 'contentment', 'share', 'him.The', 'movie', 'time', 'flashy', 'cutting', 'director', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'setting', 'up', 'camera', 'simply', 'letting', 'scene', 'unfold', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'when', 'Schultze', 'home', 'can', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'as', 'slow-moving', 'Schultze', 'stay', 'Once', 'get', 'rhythm', 'movie', 'little', 'dialogue', 'especially', 'when', 'Schultze', 'Texas', 'just', 'efforts', 'well-meaning', 'man', 'be', 'understood', 'efforts', 'well-meaning', 'Texans', 'Creoles', 'Cajuns', 'understand', 'movie', 'dead-pan', 'sense', 'humor', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'poignant', 'not', 'sad', 'even', 'ending', 'not', 'too', 'sentimental', 'movie', 'well', 'photographed', 'especially', 'long', 'gray', 'days', 'Schultze', 'home', 'town', 'lush', 'bayou', 'landscapes', 'make', 'up', 'last', 'half', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'just', 'fine', 'only', 'significant', 'extra', 'commentary', 'German', 'subtitles', 'director', 'who', 'like', 'quirky', 'small-scale', 'films', 'Schultze', 'Blues', 'fits', 'right', 'two', 'other', 'fine', 'movies', 'Bagdad', 'Cafe', 'Man', 'Past', 'three', 'are', 'worth', 'having']",N/A
914165,AUHG8KSHI529U,B0009W5IQ0,Craig Matteson,"[6, 8]","See this movie.  Please!  Don't worry about the English subtitles, there really is not that much dialogue in the film and when Shultze does get to America, well, the Americans speak English.  The images tell the story of this film even more than the words.  Plus, there is an effect of not even noticing the subtitles after a couple of minutes.This is a film about a seemingly-stolid block of man named Schultze.  He is forced into early retirement from his job in the salt mines with a couple of his buddies.  Since all they know is the pit, they don't handle retirement all that well.  The images of the film are absolutely wonderful in showing us the deadening symmetry and regularity of their lives.  One I can't help sharing with you is the cheap lamp made of rock salt they are given as their retirement gift.They are also members of an amateur music society that is coming up on its fiftieth birthday.  Schultze, like his father before him, is an accordion player, and every year he plays a polka in their presentation.  However, he happens upon a radio station playing Zydeco music.  This ends up changing Schultze's life forever and sets this unadventurous man on a hero's journey whose details I cannot share with you.  You must see all of them for yourself.  Each of the great images in this film could fill pages and pages of explanation because they are so richly conceived and yet shot with such minimal action or dialogue.The ending of the movie left me a bit unsatisfied, but I can understand the hero's fate after he sacrifices everything to reach his final destination.  However, being a musician myself, I know how much he and the other musicians would have enjoyed themselves more if a more outgoing approach had been taken - you don't need English to get other musicians to understand that you like their music and want to play with them.However, that is a quibble.  And it is wonderful how Schultze's grand adventure and his hometown buddies' misunderstanding of and projection onto the hero's adventure leads to changes in what is acceptable and what is also desirable even if symmetrical respectability still holds them in thrall.",5,A hero's journey to seek out his muse in Zydeco!,1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,2154,"['See', 'movie', 'Please', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'English', 'subtitles', 'really', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'dialogue', 'film', 'when', 'Shultze', 'get', 'America', 'well', 'Americans', 'speak', 'English', 'images', 'tell', 'story', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'words', 'effect', 'not', 'even', 'noticing', 'subtitles', 'couple', 'minutes.This', 'film', 'seemingly-stolid', 'block', 'man', 'named', 'Schultze', 'forced', 'early', 'retirement', 'job', 'salt', 'mines', 'couple', 'buddies', 'know', 'pit', 'do', ""n't"", 'handle', 'retirement', 'well', 'images', 'film', 'are', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'showing', 'deadening', 'symmetry', 'regularity', 'lives', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'sharing', 'cheap', 'lamp', 'made', 'rock', 'salt', 'are', 'given', 'retirement', 'gift.They', 'are', 'also', 'members', 'amateur', 'music', 'society', 'coming', 'up', 'fiftieth', 'birthday', 'Schultze', 'father', 'accordion', 'player', 'year', 'polka', 'presentation', 'However', 'radio', 'station', 'playing', 'Zydeco', 'music', 'up', 'changing', 'Schultze', 'life', 'forever', 'unadventurous', 'man', 'hero', 'journey', 'details', 'can', 'not', 'share', 'must', 'see', 'great', 'images', 'film', 'could', 'fill', 'pages', 'pages', 'explanation', 'are', 'so', 'richly', 'conceived', 'yet', 'shot', 'such', 'minimal', 'action', 'dialogue.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'left', 'bit', 'unsatisfied', 'can', 'understand', 'hero', 'fate', 'everything', 'reach', 'final', 'destination', 'However', 'being', 'musician', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'other', 'musicians', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'more', 'outgoing', 'approach', 'had', 'been', 'taken', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'English', 'get', 'other', 'musicians', 'understand', 'like', 'music', 'want', 'play', 'them.However', 'quibble', 'wonderful', 'how', 'Schultze', 'grand', 'adventure', 'hometown', 'buddies', 'misunderstanding', 'projection', 'hero', 'adventure', 'changes', 'what', 'acceptable', 'what', 'also', 'desirable', 'even', 'symmetrical', 'respectability', 'still', 'thrall']",N/A

How the protagonist Schultze got from one place to the other, barely speaking any lines at all in almost two hours, and just what his journey symbolizes beyond mere geography, constitute the plot of this film.Schultze and two of his buddies retire from the local salt mine, but after puttering in the garden and pestering their families, life as pensioners settles into the predictable monotony that we might expect in an insular subculture characterized by traditional polka music. Later he even stops forlornly in front of the mine on his bike. One kid sneers at the three old codgers, ""I'll never be like that."" The bachelor Schultze lives alone, but we learn from family photos that his father was a noted accordion player. Schultze is too, and one night on his little radio he hears some zydeco music, an accordion-based genre from Louisiana. He turns off the radio after a minute, then turns it back on, then pulls our his battered accordion and reproduces the tune. He can't sleep but stares at the ceiling because he can't get the music out of his head. He's hooked. This new musical passion gives Schultze a new lease on life, but dare he play such newfangled music in the land of polka? His friends urge him on despite petty detractors, and even send him to their sister city in Texas for their annual German music festival. There Schultze experiences a new joie de vivre, a new style of music, a new geography, and new friends--all without knowing any English.Some people found this film plodding, but I loved its minimalist, slow-moving style through which we watch the endearing Schultze discover himself.

That was an exceptional experience; we had no idea what was coming and didn't realize that much of the first half of the film was in German with English subtitles.There is almost nothing about the film that will be familiar to American audiences; although the last part of the film takes place in the United States, the direction of the film results in an experience totally different from the fare we usually get.This is a touching and gently paced story of a man who has just retired from a career as a miner in a salt mine. He plays the accordion as a hobby and is active in the local German music organization. By accident he makes a discovery which will change his life. The movie is the story of this discovery and its deep impact on his priorities.The movie tells his story in a relaxed, introspective manner that never seems in a hurry; there is always time to ""smell the roses."" I found the insights into German life in a small German village to be very interesting and contributed a lot to my enjoyment of the movie.As the story takes us from Germany to the United States, this same relaxed pace still prevails and we see rare insights into life in New Braunfels, Texas at the Wurstfest, along the Gulf coast and into the swamps of Louisiana. One gets the strong feeling that one is seeing life in these locations as it is really lived.This movie is an affectionate glimpse into the life of an ordinary man who discovers within himself an extraordinary passion.

914169,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0009W5IQ0,Ed Uyeshima,"[7, 8]","First-time director-writer Michael Schorr has made a gently idiosyncratic film that is at once bittersweet and enervating, a combination familiar to anyone acquainted with the works of filmmaker Jim Jarmusch. It feels like Schorr is indeed making a Jarmusch-like film in his gently drawn character study of Schultze, an accordion-playing German salt mineworker. What I like about Schorr's style is the naturalness with which he presents such potentially eccentric characters and also the elliptical nature of his story treatment, i.e., he lets the viewer fill in all the blanks in the storyline instead of inserting contrived plot devices to move the film along.The plot revolves around the early retirement given to Schultze and his two beer-drinking co-workers. As the lone bachelor of the trio and caring for an ailing mother in a nursing home, Schultze is bored in his small town in Sachsen-Anhalt region of Germany. By chance, he hears a snippet of zydeco music on the radio and becomes so instantly hooked that he takes odd jobs to save up for a trip to the bayou country in Louisiana. Fate somehow works in his favor as his town's music club is having a 50th anniversary celebration, including a trip for a luckily chosen musician to the US sister city of New Braunfels, Texas. After a controversial performance of zydeco music at an otherwise all-polka concert, Schultze wins the trip and makes his way to Louisiana. There, he rents a boat, travels the bayous and meets lots of nice people along the way.It's a sweet story that Schorr has elongated with long, establishing shots and scenes, some relatively inconsequential like the flamenco-dancing waitress, that drag on for too long, but he compensates for the most part with the sheer quirkiness of the episodic plot. The comedy is not laugh-out-loud funny (except for a bikini shot of Schultze in a Jacuzzi), but the film's observational humor brings a gentle resonance to the story. While his rotund figure and gentle manner would initially have you think he will be the reincarnation of S.Z. ""Cuddles"" Sakall from ""Casablanca"", Horst Krause actually plays Schultze in quite a plain-faced manner, imbuing his character with an inarticulate, realistic humanism. Harald Warmbrunn as J&uuml;rgen and Karl-Fred Muller as Manfred lend sound comic support as Schultze's buddies. Interestingly, all the roles are filled with such natural actors that the whole venture often feels like a documentary, especially when the film comes stateside.While I enjoyed Axel Schneppat's cinematography, I think the editing by Tina Hillmann is frankly not disciplined enough to completely pull off such a sweet-spirited parable, and from my perspective, the 114-minute film could have easily been shortened by a half-hour. After all, Schultze's journey to Louisiana doesn't happen until well after the one-hour mark. I also think that Schorr views Schultze a bit too much at arm's length and doesn't allow us to get to know him beyond the thoughtful, befuddled man that Schorr presents here. For example, there is a lovely scene near the end of the film where Schultze asks for water from a local woman cooking crabs, but it's not clear beyond her sense of giving why a bonding occurs between the two. If there is a moment of catharsis for Schultze, I'm not sure I was aware of it. The charm of the 2003 movie, however, will likely sway you if you are patient enough to absorb the deliberate pacing. The DVD's one significant extra is Schorr's detailed, informative commentary on an alternate track. He speaks in German but the English subtitles help translate his often illuminating remarks. There are three similar, German-language trailers included, as well as various previews for other Paramount Classics films.",4,Gentle Though Overlong Character Study of a Retired German Salt Miner's Zydeco Obsession,1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,3758,"['First-time', 'director-writer', 'Michael', 'Schorr', 'made', 'gently', 'idiosyncratic', 'film', 'once', 'bittersweet', 'enervating', 'combination', 'familiar', 'anyone', 'acquainted', 'works', 'filmmaker', 'Jim', 'Jarmusch', 'Schorr', 'indeed', 'making', 'Jarmusch-like', 'film', 'gently', 'drawn', 'character', 'study', 'Schultze', 'accordion-playing', 'German', 'salt', 'mineworker', 'What', 'like', 'Schorr', 'style', 'naturalness', 'such', 'potentially', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'also', 'elliptical', 'nature', 'story', 'treatment', 'i.e.', 'viewer', 'fill', 'blanks', 'storyline', 'instead', 'inserting', 'contrived', 'plot', 'devices', 'move', 'film', 'along.The', 'plot', 'early', 'retirement', 'given', 'Schultze', 'two', 'beer-drinking', 'co-workers', 'lone', 'bachelor', 'trio', 'caring', 'ailing', 'mother', 'nursing', 'home', 'Schultze', 'bored', 'small', 'town', 'Sachsen-Anhalt', 'region', 'Germany', 'chance', 'snippet', 'zydeco', 'music', 'radio', 'so', 'instantly', 'hooked', 'odd', 'jobs', 'save', 'up', 'trip', 'bayou', 'country', 'Louisiana', 'Fate', 'somehow', 'favor', 'town', 'music', 'club', 'having', '50th', 'anniversary', 'celebration', 'including', 'trip', 'luckily', 'chosen', 'musician', 'US', 'sister', 'city', 'New', 'Braunfels', 'Texas', 'controversial', 'performance', 'zydeco', 'music', 'otherwise', 'all-polka', 'concert', 'Schultze', 'trip', 'way', 'Louisiana', 'boat', 'bayous', 'meets', 'lots', 'nice', 'people', 'way.It', 'sweet', 'story', 'Schorr', 'elongated', 'long', 'establishing', 'shots', 'scenes', 'relatively', 'inconsequential', 'flamenco-dancing', 'waitress', 'drag', 'too', 'long', 'most', 'part', 'sheer', 'quirkiness', 'episodic', 'plot', 'comedy', 'not', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'bikini', 'shot', 'Schultze', 'Jacuzzi', 'film', 'observational', 'humor', 'gentle', 'resonance', 'story', 'rotund', 'figure', 'gentle', 'manner', 'would', 'initially', 'have', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'reincarnation', 'S.Z', 'Cuddles', 'Sakall', 'Casablanca', 'Horst', 'Krause', 'actually', 'Schultze', 'quite', 'plain-faced', 'manner', 'imbuing', 'character', 'inarticulate', 'realistic', 'humanism', 'Harald', 'Warmbrunn', 'J', 'uuml', 'rgen', 'Karl-Fred', 'Muller', 'Manfred', 'lend', 'sound', 'comic', 'support', 'Schultze', 'buddies', 'Interestingly', 'roles', 'are', 'filled', 'such', 'natural', 'actors', 'whole', 'venture', 'often', 'documentary', 'especially', 'when', 'film', 'stateside.While', 'enjoyed', 'Axel', 'Schneppat', 'cinematography', 'think', 'editing', 'Tina', 'Hillmann', 'frankly', 'not', 'disciplined', 'enough', 'completely', 'pull', 'off', 'such', 'sweet-spirited', 'parable', 'perspective', '114-minute', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'shortened', 'half-hour', 'Schultze', 'journey', 'Louisiana', ""n't"", 'happen', 'well', 'one-hour', 'mark', 'also', 'think', 'Schorr', 'views', 'Schultze', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'arm', 'length', ""n't"", 'allow', 'get', 'know', 'thoughtful', 'befuddled', 'man', 'Schorr', 'presents', 'here', 'example', 'lovely', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'Schultze', 'water', 'local', 'woman', 'cooking', 'crabs', 'not', 'clear', 'sense', 'giving', 'why', 'bonding', 'two', 'moment', 'catharsis', 'Schultze', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'aware', 'charm', '2003', 'movie', 'however', 'will', 'likely', 'sway', 'are', 'patient', 'enough', 'absorb', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'DVD', 'one', 'significant', 'extra', 'Schorr', 'detailed', 'informative', 'commentary', 'alternate', 'track', 'German', 'English', 'subtitles', 'help', 'translate', 'often', 'illuminating', 'remarks', 'are', 'three', 'similar', 'German-language', 'trailers', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'various', 'previews', 'other', 'Paramount', 'Classics', 'films']",N/A

Ah, the vagaries of near-insanity plus senility....However, post-Katrina and post-BP spill, it is an excellent time to revel in this beautiful film that is as much about Louisiana-Delta life as it is about the title character. It will be a bit heartbreaking to see now....Seen it must be, if you are a human with a soul!Schultze (Horst Krause), a kind, silent and very roly-poly salt miner/professional accordion-player (he resembles me strongly) finds himself on the brink of expiring from ennui after retiring. One day he ambles across a station playing Zydeco fresh from Louisiana. At first, Schultze frowns and turns the station. After pondering a while, he tunes back in and really gets his freak-on from the music.Soon he is immersed in the Creole-Cajun culture. He tunes in to the station one day, looking forward to the Cajun cooking lesson he is about to receive. It is side-splitting, with Schultze following the instructions--the radio announcer seems to be watching Schultze. ""DON'T UNCOVER THE POT YET!"", it scolds when Schultze is about to uncover the pot for a peek at the food.Schultze looks sheepish. He cracks open a brew and gulps it down...""AHHH, MAKES YOU THIRSTY, DOESN'T IT?"", the radio coos at him. He nods childishly. Funny stuff, even funnier in German. Schultze invites his pals over for a jambalaya/gumbo dinner, which almost blows the tops of their heads to the moon.Schultze does not get the blues...Schultze is in love. He has learned the piece he heard on the radio and attempts to play it at an old music festival. He is jeered in the most hateful, racist terms (""Jungle music!"", shouts one old Nazi). Schultze storms out, angered by this intolerance.The only solution is for Schultze, like the BP oil spill, to scatter himself across the entire Delta and get to New Orleans or someplace nearby. In spite of the language barrier and weird Cajun women who drool over the chubby senior, he gets his little tugboat and maneuvers expertly. He even sails across the path of some duck hunters and snags some dinner. Later, he is offered hospitality by a lovely Delta-dwelling lady Aretha (Anne Angelle) and here is where I leave the rest to you to find the magic in this magical, semi-tragic film.It is a film reminiscent of Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati. This movie may be the only film I know that shows us in close-up our Louisianan-Deltan wetlands that are now in danger of vanishing.

Karasik,"[43, 49]","This story of a retired German miner who becomes inspired to play zydeco music (instead of the traditional polka) on his accordion unfolds as delicately as a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis.  If you're the type of viewer who becomes impatient with subtle, real-time narrative, you might find it tedious.  But this film is beautifully done, and even the very slow scenes are enhanced by droll sight gags and persuasive glimpses of emotion.  Schultze's dreary northern German town, with its cast of mostly benign denizens, becomes utterly endearing, as are the characters Schultze encounters on his odyssey in search of zydeco.  The film's great success is that we come to totally identify with the seeming ""lumpenproletariat"" of a protagonist as his gentle and poetic soul is revealed.  While it is brilliantly grounded in minute details, the film works beautifully as an exploration of the individual's quest for self-realization and artistic expression.

The utter simplicity of technique that writer/director Michael Schorr uses to tell this quiet tale of the glory of the human spirit is magical.  This is one of those films that deserves a very wide audience from every age group!Schultze (Horst Krause), J&uuml;rgen (Harald Warmbrunn) and Manfred (Karl Fred M&uuml;ller) have just been retired from their life's occupation of working the salt mines in a bleak little German town, and  are left to 'celebrate' (with their company 'trophy lamps' made of large illuminated salt crystals!), drink beer, and ponder their next step: retired life.  Of the three, Schultze is the loner, his wife in an extended care facility for the mentally challenged where Schultze plays his accordion polkas for their entertainment. The woman in charge Frau Lorant  (Rosemarie Deibel) encourages Schultze to further his interest in his accordion.  Manfred and J&uuml;rgen insist he play polka music and enter a contest in America.  But Schultze has heard zydeco music on the radio (zydeco = a style of dance music originating in Louisiana that is usually played on accordion, guitar, and violin and combines traditional French melodies with Caribbean and blues influences) and becomes quietly obsessed with that music.Off to America to compete in a Texan Polka Contest, loner Schultze wanders to Louisiana where he finds not only the music of his soul but a people who accept him more than his little German hometown.  And the gentle message of this quiet little film is about loneliness and friendship and the impact they make on us all.Schorr spends the bulk of this two-hour journey with visuals that depict isolation, longing, and the small things that make up what we call life.  His cast is superb, with Horst Krause's Schultze creating one of the most memorable characters on film. In a time when Baby Boomers are looking at retirement with anxiety, this little movie is just the antidote.  Highly Recommended!

Moore,"[28, 33]","Michael Schorr's ""Schultze Gets the Blues"" is a quiet, droll and unexpectedly poignant film that--like its protagonist--takes its own sweet time getting to its destination, but both the journey and the destination are hard to forget. Schultze (Horst Krause) is a bored, phlegmatic retiree and polka accordionist in an ugly, dull German mining town. One day, however, he hears a snatch of zydeco music over the radio, and from then on zydeco and the land of its birth--the Louisiana bayou country--become his twin obsessions. An invitation to a polka festival in Texas gives him the excuse he dreams of, and soon he's playing hooky from the festival, puttering into the bayous in a rented shrimp boat. ""Schultze Gets the Blues"" is reminiscent of ""Stroszek,"" Werner Herzog's story of Germans lost in the vast strangeness of America, only much more benign. It  is odd and asymmetrical (except for the matching shots at the beginning and end), never taking us precisely where we expect to go--kind of like life. Schorr makes Schultze a courtly, portly, lovable Everyman, and what begins as comedy ends as a moving tribute to the philosophy of Carpe Diem.

The movie is long-winded and all frames seem to have been painstakingly arranged to look beautiful.  It's not those laugh-out-loud sort of a movie but a movie that would sit through watching and contemplating.  It all revolves around Shultze, a salt retired miner who potters around the house during his retirement and by chance, he comes across a Zydeco over the radio.  He retires simultaneously with two of his fellow friends who are too complacent or too conditioned to move away from their daily routines.  Being an accomplished accordion player, passed on the tradition by his deceased father, Schultze is suddenly worried that something is wrong with him to change radically of his taste for music.  Being reassured by his doctor and through leap of faith, he not only performs the Zydeco music in his town's music festival but he travels all the way to the States to trace the origin of the music.  There, he's got a bit of hits and misses.  The ending is quite unexpected but suffice to say that we are never too old to believe in ourselves to satisfy our unfulfilled dreams.

914187,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B0009W5IQ0,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[3, 6]","The Michael Schorr film, ""Schultze Gets the Blues"" (German with English subtitles), could have been many things.  It could have been uplifting.  It could have been funny.  It could have been enlightening.  Instead, it is an oddly depressing study of an apparently wasted life, and the audience is embarrassed at the few smiles the film prompts because they all come at the expense of the title character, and he as problems enough as it is.The Schultze of the title does not appear to have a first name.  His friends all call him Schultze, and he refers to himself as Schultze.  This mononomial is apparently the director's cue to us that poor Schultze is a one-dimensional character at best.  While poignant, it wasn't really necessary, because Horst Krause's masterful portrayal of the sad sack central character is more than enough to get the message across.  No leading character has had fewer lines since Harpo pranced across the screen with his brothers.  Schultze is the embodiment of Thoreau's life of quiet desperation.The film opens with Schultze's apparently forced retirement, and for a very long while thereafter it goes simply nowhere....much like Schultze's life itself.  But we get the feeling that Schultze's life never was going anywhere anyway, the only difference is that where he once passed the time in the bowels of a salt mine, he now passes it in the dreary open air of eastern Germany.The ""Blues"" of the title mistakenly refers to Schultze's belated discovery of and enthusiasm for Cajun music.  The trailers for the movie lead the audience to think that this discovery will finally lead Schultze to a new life and a new style.  Sadly, the truth is that as the movie plods along, Schultze also plods all too slowly toward this anticipated emotional payoff, and he barely makes the finish line.The direction, while very European in its pace and scene set up, is also a metaphor for Schultze's life.  The frustrated American viewer screaming ""Get on with it,"" at his TV screen, could equally be talking to the director about the story or to Schultze about his life.The movie's locale shifts from Germany to Texas and the Louisiana bayou as Schultze is given the gift of a trip to their community's sister city in the U.S. by his neighbors and two friends.  But in the States, Schultze largely drifts just as he did in the Fatherland.  He meets people, yes, but he never really interacts with them.  The expected difficulties of the language barrier do not appear to prevent Schultze from having at least casual interactions with the locals, but they too are just a metaphor for Schultze's inability to generally form any sort of real human bond.  Just as he wanders in and out of scenes, he wanders in and out of the lives of those he meets, leaving barely a ripple even as he leaves a bewildered dance partner holding two beers and wondering just where he'd gone.In the end, Schultze does find some sort of contentment, arriving all too late at the Promised Land of his newly acquired heart's music.  But his sojourn there is all too brief, and his return home is striking in its empty ceremony.An interesting movie that delivers a message quite at odds with the expectations set up by its advertising, Schultze Gets the Blues is definitely something worth seeing, but not something you will want to watch alone.",4,Schultze gets lost,1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,3337,"['Michael', 'Schorr', 'film', 'Schultze', 'Blues', 'German', 'English', 'subtitles', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'uplifting', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'enlightening', 'Instead', 'oddly', 'depressing', 'study', 'apparently', 'wasted', 'life', 'audience', 'embarrassed', 'few', 'film', 'prompts', 'come', 'expense', 'title', 'character', 'as', 'problems', 'enough', 'Schultze', 'title', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'first', 'name', 'call', 'Schultze', 'Schultze', 'mononomial', 'apparently', 'director', 'cue', 'poor', 'Schultze', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'best', 'poignant', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary', 'Horst', 'Krause', 'masterful', 'portrayal', 'sad', 'sack', 'central', 'character', 'more', 'enough', 'get', 'message', 'leading', 'character', 'had', 'fewer', 'lines', 'Harpo', 'pranced', 'screen', 'brothers', 'Schultze', 'embodiment', 'Thoreau', 'life', 'quiet', 'desperation.The', 'film', 'Schultze', 'apparently', 'forced', 'retirement', 'very', 'long', 'thereafter', 'simply', 'nowhere', '.much', 'Schultze', 'life', 'get', 'feeling', 'Schultze', 'life', 'never', 'was', 'going', 'anywhere', 'anyway', 'only', 'difference', 'where', 'once', 'passed', 'time', 'bowels', 'salt', 'mine', 'now', 'dreary', 'open', 'air', 'eastern', 'Germany.The', 'Blues', 'title', 'mistakenly', 'Schultze', 'belated', 'discovery', 'enthusiasm', 'Cajun', 'music', 'trailers', 'movie', 'lead', 'audience', 'think', 'discovery', 'will', 'finally', 'lead', 'Schultze', 'new', 'life', 'new', 'style', 'Sadly', 'truth', 'movie', 'plods', 'along', 'Schultze', 'also', 'too', 'slowly', 'anticipated', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'barely', 'finish', 'line.The', 'direction', 'very', 'European', 'pace', 'scene', 'set', 'up', 'also', 'metaphor', 'Schultze', 'life', 'frustrated', 'American', 'viewer', 'screaming', 'Get', 'TV', 'screen', 'could', 'equally', 'be', 'talking', 'director', 'story', 'Schultze', 'life.The', 'movie', 'locale', 'shifts', 'Germany', 'Texas', 'Louisiana', 'bayou', 'Schultze', 'given', 'gift', 'trip', 'community', 'sister', 'city', 'U.S.', 'neighbors', 'two', 'friends', 'States', 'Schultze', 'largely', 'just', 'did', 'Fatherland', 'people', 'yes', 'never', 'really', 'expected', 'difficulties', 'language', 'barrier', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'prevent', 'Schultze', 'having', 'least', 'casual', 'interactions', 'locals', 'too', 'are', 'just', 'metaphor', 'Schultze', 'inability', 'generally', 'form', 'sort', 'real', 'human', 'bond', 'Just', 'scenes', 'lives', 'leaving', 'barely', 'ripple', 'even', 'bewildered', 'dance', 'partner', 'holding', 'two', 'beers', 'wondering', 'just', 'where', ""'d"", 'gone.In', 'end', 'Schultze', 'find', 'sort', 'contentment', 'arriving', 'too', 'late', 'Promised', 'Land', 'newly', 'acquired', 'heart', 'music', 'sojourn', 'too', 'brief', 'return', 'home', 'striking', 'empty', 'ceremony.An', 'interesting', 'movie', 'message', 'quite', 'odds', 'expectations', 'set', 'up', 'advertising', 'Schultze', 'Blues', 'definitely', 'something', 'worth', 'seeing', 'not', 'something', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'alone']",N/A

914191,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,B0009W5IQ0,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[6, 8]","Schultze is a foreman at a salt mine in Germany who, along with his two friends Manfred and Jurgen, is laid off shortly before his retirement. The three clearly live to work, or rather, work fills the void in their drab, cookie cutter community. Day after day, they sit in the bar, staring into space, all purpose having been taken away for them. For Manfried and Jurgen, who are both married and have families, there is at least some distraction, but the lonely bachelor Schultze leads a solitary, unfulfilled existence polishing his garden gnomes and taking frequent naps. Although surrounded by salt, Schulze lacks this element and craves it: by heavily salting his food, and by ""tasting"" his salt lamp: a metaphor for his bland life.All this changes one night as he listens to the radio: turning off a report about lung cancer in miners (could this explain his persistent cough?), he happens across a Zydeco tune. He turns off the radio, then is drawn back. Grabbing his accordion, he plays the tune, at first slowly, then faster and faster. Instead of his traditional polka at the annual music fest, Schultze decides to shake things up a little and play Zydeco. Needless to say, this goes against the grain, and even evolves into a near-brawl as Schultze plays his Zydeco tune - one lout jumps up indignantly and yells ""N**** music!"" Schultze's small, self-conscious group of friends are the only ones to applaud his courage and embrace his newfound passion for Zydeco. The film's title is both a clever reference to Schultze's doldrums and to his newfound passion for Zydeco.Schultze finds an unlikely ally in Lisa, the new (female) bartender with a fiery disposition, who introduces herself by dancing a passionate, sensual flamenco dance on the tabletops and whispers a guttural ""Ole."" She is attracted to something in the lonely Schultze, and anonymously gives him a book about the Swamp Kings of Louisiana. Another is Frau Laurant, a resident at the nursing home where Schultze goes to visit his mother. She has a fondness for whiskey and breaking rules, and gets Schulze to live it up a bit, encouraging him to try his luck at the casino and arranging concerts for his new Zydeco music.The town is celebrating its fiftieth annual music celebration, and their sister town in Texas has invited one German musician to play at their German-American festival. Schultze is chosen for this honor, but upon arriving in Texas, he soon finds that German-Americans (who are obsessed by Lawrence Welk polkas and enormous steins of beer) aren't interested in actual German culture. He buys a small motorboat and sets off for the bayous of Louisiana, meeting an unlikely cast of characters along the way: a Czech band that, when he asks for petrol, hands him a glass of vodka, but then gives Schultze a ride to get gas for his boat, a kindly traveler that makes Schultze feel at home in the strange confines of Texas by inviting him into the hot tub (I laughed out loud at the sight of portly Schultze in a Speedo, his beer belly obscuring everything else), and a kind African-American woman and her daughter that invite Schultze into their bayou home for a feast of fresh crab and shrimp and a night out dancing.This film truly captures the wild flavor of the bayous and dancehalls of Louisiana: we hear older couples greeting each other in French, elderly couples dancing cheek to cheek to gentle Cajun fiddle, and the endless tree and water view of the swamps. In Texas, the locals are all portrayed as elderly and suspicious of anything new, much like where Schultze just came from in Germany. He finds kindness in unexpected places, and even though his passion arrived so late in life, he makes the most of his time left.The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, at times a series of carefully composed shots that show the tedium and loneliness of Schultze's former life: his home, dwarfed by a pile of potash, the identical garage doors and driveways, the empty home, devoid of any personal touches. The soundtrack is an awesome collection of rollicking Zydeco and Cajun and the occasional German polka. This film struck a chord with me as soon as I heard about it: the first song I can remember hearing was the Zydeco standard ""My Toot Toot"" by Rockin' Sidney at age five, and ever since, I've been collecting Cajun and Zydeco.A delightful film, and although slow-paced, one that is ultimately rewarding.

Goria ""Historian""","[9, 11]","For my son of 15, who, curiously enough, was the first person to recommend this film to my wife and I, Schultze represented something of a German middle-aged version of the quirky yet entertaining main character in the eponymous film Napoleon Dynamite.  The seemingly buoyant DVD cover together with excellent reviews accompanying the DVD package further piqued our interest. We were not disappointed. And we were also very grateful that our son did not reveal the film's ending.People who know something about Germany - its society, people and culture - are more likely to appreciate Director Michael Schorr's remarkable gifts as he portrays the setting, mood, pace and undercurrent of the film. I found Schultze Gets the Blues to be a most intriguing, engaging and deeply sensitive film! The plot was brilliantly conceived. Horst Krause is endearing as the recently retired accordion-playing salt miner, Schultze, who, freed from the daily drudgery of the mine, finds himself in search of a new direction. Schultze's accordion becomes the medium through which we witness his metamorphosis. He discovers Zydeco on a local radio station. (Stop here if you don't wish to have the ending revealed.)It is a joy to witness Schorr's direction and Krause's performance during the transformation of Schultze's musical yearning away from the traditional, predictable and perhaps rigid ump-pa-pas of German polka to the much less readily discernible free-flowing rhythm of Louisiana Zydeco. Schultze has found a musical form that will serve as an allegory for the individual freedom that he is seeking.In the Louisiana Bayou, Schultze's spirit is fully cast.  Schultze ultimately finds both Zydeco and freedom at the precise moment that his life is cut short. Spiritual and musical life in the bayou may be arousing and satisfying, but conditions are poor and the lifesaving medical care that Schultze would have surely received in Germany is nowhere in evidence in the Louisiana Bayou. As with too many people who live in this inherently dangerous planet, Schultze's life, but not his spirit, has been overwhelmed by menacing natural forces surrounding him. We are reminded that freedom and safety are not synonomous.In the catastrophic wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we are reminded further of the inherent fragility and socioeconomic imbalances of life in the Gulf Coast region - and of the advisability of each of us grasping as much of life as our bodies and spirits will allow.Schultze's last vision of this world is one that has been liberated by the redeeming melodies and rhythms of Zydeco. And while Schultze's final moment may have been fleeting, it nonetheless radiates, representing the ultimate triumph of a poignant, yet unique and independent spirit.",4,"Schultze Gets the Blues......an intriguing, engaging and deeply sensitive film",1131667200,"11 11, 2005",2005,2763,"['son', '15', 'who', 'curiously', 'enough', 'was', 'first', 'person', 'recommend', 'film', 'wife', 'Schultze', 'represented', 'something', 'German', 'middle-aged', 'version', 'quirky', 'yet', 'entertaining', 'main', 'character', 'eponymous', 'film', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'seemingly', 'buoyant', 'DVD', 'cover', 'together', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'accompanying', 'DVD', 'package', 'further', 'piqued', 'interest', 'were', 'not', 'disappointed', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'grateful', 'son', 'did', 'not', 'reveal', 'film', 'ending.People', 'who', 'know', 'something', 'Germany', 'society', 'people', 'culture', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'appreciate', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Schorr', 'remarkable', 'gifts', 'setting', 'mood', 'pace', 'undercurrent', 'film', 'found', 'Schultze', 'Blues', 'be', 'most', 'intriguing', 'engaging', 'deeply', 'sensitive', 'film', 'plot', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'conceived', 'Horst', 'Krause', 'endearing', 'recently', 'retired', 'accordion-playing', 'salt', 'miner', 'Schultze', 'who', 'freed', 'daily', 'drudgery', 'mine', 'search', 'new', 'direction', 'Schultze', 'accordion', 'medium', 'witness', 'metamorphosis', 'Zydeco', 'local', 'radio', 'station', 'Stop', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'have', 'ending', 'revealed', 'joy', 'witness', 'Schorr', 'direction', 'Krause', 'performance', 'transformation', 'Schultze', 'musical', 'yearning', 'away', 'traditional', 'predictable', 'perhaps', 'rigid', 'ump-pa-pas', 'German', 'polka', 'much', 'less', 'readily', 'discernible', 'free-flowing', 'rhythm', 'Louisiana', 'Zydeco', 'Schultze', 'found', 'musical', 'form', 'will', 'serve', 'allegory', 'individual', 'freedom', 'Louisiana', 'Bayou', 'Schultze', 'spirit', 'fully', 'cast', 'Schultze', 'ultimately', 'Zydeco', 'freedom', 'precise', 'moment', 'life', 'cut', 'short', 'Spiritual', 'musical', 'life', 'bayou', 'may', 'be', 'arousing', 'satisfying', 'conditions', 'are', 'poor', 'lifesaving', 'medical', 'care', 'Schultze', 'would', 'have', 'surely', 'received', 'Germany', 'nowhere', 'evidence', 'Louisiana', 'Bayou', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'inherently', 'dangerous', 'planet', 'Schultze', 'life', 'not', 'spirit', 'been', 'overwhelmed', 'menacing', 'natural', 'forces', 'surrounding', 'are', 'reminded', 'freedom', 'safety', 'are', 'not', 'synonomous.In', 'catastrophic', 'wake', 'Hurricanes', 'Katrina', 'Rita', 'are', 'reminded', 'further', 'inherent', 'fragility', 'socioeconomic', 'imbalances', 'life', 'Gulf', 'Coast', 'region', 'advisability', 'grasping', 'much', 'life', 'bodies', 'spirits', 'will', 'allow.Schultze', 'last', 'vision', 'world', 'one', 'been', 'liberated', 'redeeming', 'melodies', 'rhythms', 'Zydeco', 'Schultze', 'final', 'moment', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'fleeting', 'nonetheless', 'representing', 'ultimate', 'triumph', 'poignant', 'unique', 'independent', 'spirit']",N/A

There is very little drama, which is fine for a documentary, but not very appealing for a feature film. It has subtle humor, which again, some will like, but most will not. I could go on, but you get the point.If you realize going into it that this is going to be a slow-paced art film (almost docudrama), then you may like it. But you've got to have a lot of patience. I expect to receive a handful of ""unhelpful"" votes for this review as the filmmakers make their daily rounds to try and vote off any negative reviews. But word of mouth is the deciding factor in any film's success; and, for this one, the word of mouth - actually two words - are ""slow"" and ""subtle.""",2,IS THIS A CONSPIRACY?,1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,1413,"['funny', 'everyone', 'who', 'given', 'film', 'negative', 'review', 'received', 'mostly', 'unhelpful', 'votes', 'everyone', 'who', 'given', 'positive', 'review', 'received', 'pretty', 'much', 'unanimously', 'helpful', 'votes', 'One', 'might', 'almost', 'think', 'was', 'conspiracy', 'going', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'going', 'online', 'voting', 'positive', 'reviews', 'negative', 'ones', 'trying', 'give', 'impression', 'everyone', 'when', 'fact', 'opposite', 'probably', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'quirky', 'slow-paced', 'people', 'will', 'like', 'most', 'will', 'not', 'interesting', 'photography', 'will', 'wait', 'train', 'pass', 'person', 'walk', 'room', 'verse', 'song', 'be', 'sung', 'very', 'little', 'drama', 'fine', 'documentary', 'not', 'very', 'appealing', 'feature', 'film', 'subtle', 'humor', 'again', 'will', 'like', 'most', 'will', 'not', 'could', 'go', 'get', 'point.If', 'realize', 'going', 'going', 'be', 'slow-paced', 'art', 'film', 'almost', 'docudrama', 'then', 'may', 'like', ""'ve"", 'got', 'have', 'lot', 'patience', 'expect', 'receive', 'handful', 'unhelpful', 'votes', 'review', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'daily', 'rounds', 'try', 'vote', 'off', 'negative', 'reviews', 'word', 'mouth', 'deciding', 'factor', 'film', 'success', 'one', 'word', 'mouth', 'actually', 'two', 'words', 'are', 'slow', 'subtle']",N/A
914198,A1JMYZA3MR27WC,B0009W5IQ0,"Wux Iapan ""Fantas""","[11, 13]","I'm swiss, I do know the german mentality and culture very well, so this flick wasn't as alien to me as it must have been to many other people, and I'm also talking about the slow pacing and style of close intimate privacy that is very difficult and seldom to find this honest and real in US movies.This flick has a lot to offer if you're the kind of watcher that is paying attention to the details. On the surface we watch an old man getting retired and fearing that the gap of loneliness in front of him will be his dead end road. The man is single and alone, but loneliness is also present when he's sitting in the middle of a crowd of people. When one evening, while tuning throught the radio channels, he gets to hear some few tones of a much faster accordeon music style, things begin to change in a surprisingly subtle way.Something that seems very important to me is that you definetly do not have to like Polka music or US blues to watch this movie. In fact, it's pretty unimportant on that aspect but off course it surely helps if you're a fan. Anyway, this movie shows that there is music and rhytm in everyone, every single person has it and kinda applies to it, or does the rhythm apply to the person...? However, the german villians in the movie seem to function with 30 BPMs (beats per minute, so slow that close to standing still) as everything seems to have more weight, everything requires more time and energy than elsewhere, even ordering three beers in a boring pub is being executed with a minimum waste of energy, there's one hell of a lazy heart beat in everybody there and only some can overcome their mental walls to show signs of goodwill and true charity.Now early on we come to learn that Schultze isn't an all too social guy: he only talks if absolutly necessary and by doing so he only names to most important facts, he almost bisects even the shortest phrase to an even shorter phrase, and he never smiles. This person is not much of a useful addition to the people there. If anyone could change anything, it surely wouldn't be Schultze to do so. That is until his own life rhythm is subtly changing due to the new musical influence. While Schultze keeps doing ""his own thing"" (that is playing solo accordeon, only faster this time) the people still tend to shake their heads as this ""new stuff"" is absolutly alien to them that cannot be accepted this easily. They show signs of excitment but need assurance afterwards, that he will ""turn back to the old gold polka again, okay Schultze?"" But then, there seems to be more than meets the eye (ear) as all of a sudden two fellows get invited to a tasty dinner - for the first time in 30 years.Pay attention to the details and you will realize that there are new things going on in this man's life. He seems to have answered to an inner natural urge of enlarging his field of interests and perceptions. The accordeon club got invited to a german meeting over in the states. The members decide to send Schultze over there as a representative. What Schultze experiences over there is just enough to let him forget about that gap in front of him. He doensn't turn into a party goer, to be sure, but there's life coming back, excitment about spontaneously being invited to dinner by a black mother.In the end, back in germany, they burry this man who had in the end found new sources of freedom to untie yourself from any compulsions of accepted loneliness and unsatisfying deadlocks.During the final scene I felt sad about the ending. An old man had somehow found out he's got more mental wings in his mind than he would ever have imagined before, but why couldn't he have found these new sources earlier in his life? I thought the ending was too melancholic, but then, right before I started whining I payed more attention to the other members of his funeral: they were playing Schultze's faster accordeon style, additionally, a black umbrella was sometimes ""dancing"" between the others, a lady was moving her hips, an old man at the end of the queue was doing a pirouette etc. I'm sure they couldn't name the reasons about the subtle change in everyone's life rhythm, but exactly that has happened.Schultze was gone, but his discovery had planted a seed. Music is life and this flick is just a very very sweet and realistic tale on that subject that you won't soon forget.",5,"Music is life, is magic",1115596800,"05 9, 2005",2005,4350,"[""'m"", 'swiss', 'do', 'know', 'german', 'mentality', 'culture', 'very', 'well', 'flick', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'alien', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'other', 'people', ""'m"", 'also', 'talking', 'slow', 'pacing', 'style', 'close', 'intimate', 'privacy', 'very', 'difficult', 'seldom', 'find', 'honest', 'real', 'US', 'movies.This', 'flick', 'lot', 'offer', ""'re"", 'kind', 'watcher', 'paying', 'attention', 'details', 'surface', 'watch', 'old', 'man', 'getting', 'retired', 'fearing', 'gap', 'loneliness', 'front', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'end', 'road', 'man', 'single', 'alone', 'loneliness', 'also', 'present', 'when', 'sitting', 'middle', 'crowd', 'people', 'When', 'one', 'evening', 'tuning', 'throught', 'radio', 'channels', 'hear', 'few', 'tones', 'much', 'faster', 'accordeon', 'music', 'style', 'things', 'begin', 'change', 'surprisingly', 'subtle', 'way.Something', 'very', 'important', 'definetly', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'like', 'Polka', 'music', 'blues', 'watch', 'movie', 'fact', 'pretty', 'unimportant', 'aspect', 'course', 'surely', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'music', 'rhytm', 'everyone', 'single', 'person', 'kinda', 'applies', 'rhythm', 'apply', 'person', 'However', 'german', 'villians', 'movie', 'seem', 'function', '30', 'BPMs', 'beats', 'minute', 'so', 'slow', 'close', 'standing', 'still', 'everything', 'have', 'more', 'weight', 'everything', 'more', 'time', 'energy', 'elsewhere', 'even', 'ordering', 'three', 'beers', 'boring', 'pub', 'being', 'executed', 'minimum', 'waste', 'energy', 'one', 'hell', 'lazy', 'heart', 'beat', 'everybody', 'only', 'can', 'overcome', 'mental', 'walls', 'show', 'signs', 'goodwill', 'true', 'charity.Now', 'early', 'come', 'learn', 'Schultze', ""n't"", 'too', 'social', 'guy', 'only', 'absolutly', 'necessary', 'doing', 'so', 'only', 'most', 'important', 'facts', 'almost', 'even', 'shortest', 'phrase', 'even', 'shorter', 'phrase', 'never', 'person', 'not', 'much', 'useful', 'addition', 'people', 'there', 'anyone', 'could', 'change', 'anything', 'surely', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Schultze', 'do', 'so', 'own', 'life', 'rhythm', 'subtly', 'changing', 'due', 'new', 'musical', 'influence', 'Schultze', 'doing', 'own', 'thing', 'playing', 'solo', 'accordeon', 'only', 'faster', 'time', 'people', 'still', 'tend', 'shake', 'heads', 'new', 'stuff', 'absolutly', 'alien', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'accepted', 'easily', 'show', 'signs', 'excitment', 'need', 'assurance', 'afterwards', 'will', 'turn', 'back', 'old', 'gold', 'polka', 'again', 'Schultze', 'then', 'be', 'more', 'eye', 'ear', 'sudden', 'two', 'fellows', 'get', 'invited', 'tasty', 'dinner', 'first', 'time', '30', 'years.Pay', 'attention', 'details', 'will', 'realize', 'are', 'new', 'things', 'going', 'man', 'life', 'have', 'answered', 'inner', 'natural', 'urge', 'enlarging', 'field', 'interests', 'perceptions', 'accordeon', 'club', 'got', 'invited', 'german', 'meeting', 'states', 'members', 'decide', 'send', 'Schultze', 'over', 'there', 'representative', 'What', 'Schultze', 'just', 'enough', 'let', 'forget', 'gap', 'front', ""n't"", 'turn', 'party', 'goer', 'be', 'sure', 'life', 'coming', 'back', 'excitment', 'spontaneously', 'being', 'invited', 'dinner', 'black', 'mother.In', 'end', 'back', 'germany', 'burry', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'end', 'found', 'new', 'sources', 'freedom', 'untie', 'compulsions', 'accepted', 'loneliness', 'unsatisfying', 'deadlocks.During', 'final', 'scene', 'felt', 'sad', 'ending', 'old', 'man', 'had', 'somehow', 'found', 'got', 'more', 'mental', 'wings', 'mind', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'imagined', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'found', 'new', 'sources', 'earlier', 'life', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'too', 'melancholic', 'then', 'right', 'started', 'whining', 'payed', 'more', 'attention', 'other', 'members', 'funeral', 'were', 'playing', 'Schultze', 'faster', 'accordeon', 'style', 'additionally', 'black', 'umbrella', 'was', 'sometimes', 'dancing', 'others', 'lady', 'was', 'moving', 'hips', 'old', 'man', 'end', 'queue', 'was', 'doing', 'pirouette', 'etc', ""'m"", 'sure', 'could', ""n't"", 'name', 'reasons', 'subtle', 'change', 'everyone', 'life', 'rhythm', 'exactly', 'happened.Schultze', 'was', 'gone', 'discovery', 'had', 'planted', 'seed', 'Music', 'life', 'flick', 'just', 'very', 'very', 'sweet', 'realistic', 'tale', 'subject', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget']",N/A
