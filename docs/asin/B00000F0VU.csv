496426,A17LCDEFG5OXSQ,B00000F0VU,Curtis Mitchell,"[0, 0]","Having heard mixed things about Tekken: The Motion Picture, I decided to set out to pick a copy up anyway.  Back in the late 90s/early 2000s I was a big fan of Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie and I was definitely ok with the idea of Tekken copying that style.  Unfortunately, where the Street Fighter II animated movie definitely delivered, Tekken is not quite as solid.  Fans of characters like Paul and King will be definitely disappointed to see that besides the major characters in the show, most appearances are nothing more than small non-speaking cameos.Regardless, the movie tries to adapt the main storyline from Tekken and Tekken 2 by focusing on Kazuya Mishima's relationship with his father Heihachi and the role Jun Kazama played in Tekken 2.  Since these two characters pretty much laid the foundation for how the series developed, I think it was a smart decision.  Unfortunately, Kazuya isn't nearly as interesting in this film as he turned out in the games.  He's never quite as sinister and the aspect of being possessed by the devil gene is significantly downplayed.  He comes across as largely sympathetic and the ending is highly questionable given what we know about Kazuya now.  Jun gets better treatment though, being shown as a powerful but kind-hearted woman who knows how to get the job done.  I was quite happy to see her in a lead role in the movie and she makes a more effective headliner than Xiaoyu and Alisa from Tekken: Blood Vengeance and is much more faithful to her canon role than Jin from the live action film.  The movie is certainly an interesting take on the plot of the first two games and provides a good supplement to those games considering that story modes and plot-driven gameplay weren't really things that existed in fighting games in the mid 90s.The animation is something of a mixed bag.  The quality is not that of other animated films at the time though it is at least as good as some of the TV shows that were hitting the US market at the end of the 90s.  The art style is reminiscent of Dragon Ball Z's Akira Toriyama.  I personally hate this style so I found the animation in the films extremely mediocre but fans of Toriyama will probably like the look of the film.I'd say the mixed reception is quite accurate overall.  It does some things well and was at least partially enjoyable and other things are extremely frustrating.  Judged on its own merits (as opposed to comparing it to the competition) it is a fun movie but certainly not the quality anime film that Tekken fans would like to have.  If you see just one Tekken film, Blood Vengeance remains the best of the lot, but if you're able to find a copy of the animated film in a flea market or used DVD store somewhere, it might be worth picking up.  Assuming you can get it rather cheap, as some places charge way to much for out of print anime titles.",3,Well it isn't a complete disaster,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",2013,2873,"['Having', 'heard', 'mixed', 'things', 'Tekken', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'decided', 'set', 'out', 'pick', 'copy', 'up', 'anyway', 'Back', 'late', '90s/early', '2000s', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'II', 'Animated', 'Movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'ok', 'idea', 'Tekken', 'copying', 'style', 'Unfortunately', 'where', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'II', 'animated', 'movie', 'definitely', 'delivered', 'Tekken', 'not', 'quite', 'solid', 'Fans', 'characters', 'Paul', 'King', 'will', 'be', 'definitely', 'disappointed', 'see', 'major', 'characters', 'show', 'most', 'appearances', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'small', 'non-speaking', 'cameos.Regardless', 'movie', 'adapt', 'main', 'storyline', 'Tekken', 'Tekken', '2', 'focusing', 'Kazuya', 'Mishima', 'relationship', 'father', 'Heihachi', 'role', 'Jun', 'Kazama', 'played', 'Tekken', '2', 'two', 'characters', 'pretty', 'much', 'foundation', 'how', 'series', 'developed', 'think', 'was', 'smart', 'decision', 'Unfortunately', 'Kazuya', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'interesting', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'games', 'never', 'quite', 'sinister', 'aspect', 'being', 'possessed', 'devil', 'gene', 'significantly', 'downplayed', 'largely', 'sympathetic', 'ending', 'highly', 'questionable', 'given', 'what', 'know', 'Kazuya', 'now', 'Jun', 'better', 'treatment', 'being', 'shown', 'powerful', 'kind-hearted', 'woman', 'who', 'how', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'was', 'quite', 'happy', 'see', 'lead', 'role', 'movie', 'more', 'effective', 'headliner', 'Xiaoyu', 'Alisa', 'Tekken', 'Blood', 'Vengeance', 'much', 'more', 'faithful', 'canon', 'role', 'Jin', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'movie', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'take', 'plot', 'first', 'two', 'games', 'good', 'supplement', 'games', 'considering', 'story', 'modes', 'plot-driven', 'gameplay', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'things', 'existed', 'fighting', 'games', 'mid', '90s.The', 'animation', 'something', 'mixed', 'bag', 'quality', 'not', 'other', 'animated', 'films', 'time', 'least', 'as', 'good', 'TV', 'shows', 'were', 'hitting', 'US', 'market', 'end', '90s', 'art', 'style', 'reminiscent', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z', 'Akira', 'Toriyama', 'personally', 'hate', 'style', 'so', 'found', 'animation', 'films', 'extremely', 'mediocre', 'fans', 'Toriyama', 'will', 'probably', 'look', 'film.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'mixed', 'reception', 'quite', 'accurate', 'overall', 'things', 'well', 'was', 'least', 'partially', 'enjoyable', 'other', 'things', 'are', 'extremely', 'frustrating', 'Judged', 'own', 'merits', 'opposed', 'comparing', 'competition', 'fun', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'quality', 'anime', 'film', 'Tekken', 'fans', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'see', 'just', 'one', 'Tekken', 'film', 'Blood', 'Vengeance', 'best', 'lot', ""'re"", 'able', 'find', 'copy', 'animated', 'film', 'flea', 'market', 'used', 'DVD', 'store', 'somewhere', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'Assuming', 'can', 'get', 'rather', 'cheap', 'places', 'charge', 'way', 'much', 'print', 'anime', 'titles']",N/A

The animation is good, by far the best for a movie made in 1990 (although the sound affects for the blood when it was show, was downright silly). The plot was good, it explained why Kazyua Mishima hated his father Heihachi Mishima so much and Jun/Kazuya's relationship from childhood to adulthood. I was surprised to discover that Lee Chaolan was Heiachi's adopted son, along with the discovery that Anna and Nina Williams are feuding sisters.I'm still new to Tekken. Jun Zazama was well characterized as was Lei Wulong (who's fighting style reminds me of Jackie Chan). And the few other fighters made brief appearances on the screen to my relief. The action is good, but it isn't like the combat in the video games (naturally), it is a cartoon movie after all.There is only on strange thing in this movie; and it's Chaolan's ""R-experiment"" which are humide dinosaurs, but don't let that ruin your enjoyment of this movie. If you can watch Jurrasic park then you can watch this. There is also swearing in this movie, so think twice before letting a younger child watch this.This DVD contains English, French, Japanese, and Spanish dubs with English subtitles. The Japanese dub is surprisingly good, while the English dub is lacking a good amount of character and talent. I'm very disappointed in the reviews I saw for this movie; they were slanderous to say the least. Then again if you not a fan it's mostly your not going to like this movie.There's no need for a character development in this 60 minute movie, the creators [Namco] have already done that in the video game. So you should know the characters pretty well if you've played either Tekken III or Tekken IV.

""Badger_Mountain""","[2, 4]","When talking about Tekken The motion picture I'd have to agree with ""KaZuYa ThE uNbEaTaBlE"" (another reviewer) but instead of endlessy raving about this incrediblly impressive excellent beyond all reason anime that kicks every other anime known to man in the (rear), I'm going to tell you why.Like every other anime based on a fighting game, tekken has tons of characters, and for a 60 minute movie they were developed very well. Obviously few of them are going to have a large part, but I was surprised by how much background they could sqeeze into each character.I know, I just got finished raving about the characters but Tekken IS a character driven anime. You fall in love with all of them (except the Sumo and the dude who sells his soul to the devil). I love Roger the kangaroo. He has a short part, but every second he's on the screen you're bound to be twitching with laughter.The action sequences are very well done. Although some are unnecissarily bloody. The animation is nothing to be raved about, but is not at all bad. The English voice acting is a mix between pretty good and terrible beyond all reason.Among all of the animes I've seen based on video games (street fighter, Arc The Lad...) Tekken is definitely the best. And is in my anime top 10.",5,he he he,1028764800,"08 8, 2002",2002,1264,"['When', 'talking', 'Tekken', 'motion', 'picture', ""'d"", 'have', 'agree', 'KaZuYa', 'ThE', 'uNbEaTaBlE', 'reviewer', 'instead', 'endlessy', 'raving', 'incrediblly', 'impressive', 'excellent', 'reason', 'anime', 'other', 'anime', 'known', 'man', 'rear', ""'m"", 'going', 'tell', 'why.Like', 'other', 'anime', 'based', 'fighting', 'game', 'tekken', 'tons', 'characters', '60', 'minute', 'movie', 'were', 'developed', 'very', 'well', 'Obviously', 'few', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'large', 'part', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'could', 'sqeeze', 'character.I', 'know', 'just', 'got', 'finished', 'raving', 'characters', 'Tekken', 'character', 'driven', 'anime', 'fall', 'love', 'Sumo', 'dude', 'who', 'soul', 'devil', 'love', 'kangaroo', 'short', 'part', 'second', 'screen', ""'re"", 'bound', 'be', 'twitching', 'laughter.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'unnecissarily', 'bloody', 'animation', 'nothing', 'be', 'raved', 'not', 'bad', 'English', 'voice', 'acting', 'mix', 'pretty', 'good', 'terrible', 'reason.Among', 'animes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'based', 'video', 'games', 'street', 'fighter', 'Arc', 'Lad', 'Tekken', 'definitely', 'best', 'anime', 'top', '10']",N/A
