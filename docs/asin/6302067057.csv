But by transforming the book into a movie, we lose a few things:1) A movie can only show us things and people's actions, while the book can also give us their thoughts and motivations. Even though we see Betty running around Tehran in the movie, we can never share her feelings or thoughts. Therefore, most of the characters aren't as deep as they are in the book. Moody, for instance, just seems like the forceful Iranian husband who tries to make his wife and daughter live in Iran because HE feels like it. The book, on the other hand, gives us some background on what he was like before coming to Iran. His transformation from a typical American to a man who wishes to live in Iran in the book is much slower than in the movie (where we can see his changing attitude by the way he feels about morning prayers) and seems much more convincing.2) The scope of the movie is much shorter than a books, and therefore many people, events and places had been ommited. In this case, it's obvious an effort had been made to conserve as much of the original spirit of the book as possible, and the efforts were mostly successful, but still - the movie isn't as rich in scope as the book is. This mostly applies to the relationship between Betty and those surrounding her - I'm not sure people who only see the movie would be able to see the ups and downs in Betty's life in Iran...3) Many of the small details mentioned in the book are missing from the movie. This bothers me even more than the drastic change made to the ending! (for readers who don't realize this, Betty's horse ride out of Iran was in a bad winter storm, not through a desert, but the essence of the dangerous & tiring escape are still there). Stuff like Mahtob's and Betty's problem with typical Iranian restrooms, Betty's description of food, feasts and holidays, or even the few Farsi words she throws in every once in a while in the book...My bottom line is that for a book adaption - this is a pretty good movie. There aren't that many special features, but there is a documentary that I THINK that the 'real' Betty participated in - unfortunately, no one obthered to put in the names of people on the screen to introduce them. My advice to you - while renting / buying this DVD, borrow Betty's book from the library - since both complement each other.",4,Not as good as the book...,1024704000,"06 22, 2002",2002,2713,"['movies', 'rarely', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'books', 'are', 'based', 'understandable', 'considering', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'types', 'media.In', 'case', 'think', 'movie', 'book', 'giving', ""'visual"", 'perspective', 'things', 'even', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'Iran', 'Betty', '2nd', 'book', 'segments', 'movie', 'were', 'shot', 'Israel', 'transforming', 'book', 'movie', 'lose', 'few', 'things:1', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'show', 'things', 'people', 'actions', 'book', 'can', 'also', 'give', 'thoughts', 'motivations', 'Even', 'see', 'Betty', 'running', 'around', 'Tehran', 'movie', 'can', 'never', 'share', 'feelings', 'thoughts', 'Therefore', 'most', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'deep', 'are', 'book', 'Moody', 'instance', 'just', 'forceful', 'Iranian', 'husband', 'who', 'make', 'wife', 'daughter', 'live', 'Iran', 'HE', 'book', 'other', 'hand', 'background', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'Iran', 'transformation', 'typical', 'American', 'man', 'who', 'live', 'Iran', 'book', 'much', 'slower', 'movie', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'changing', 'attitude', 'way', 'morning', 'prayers', 'much', 'more', 'convincing.2', 'scope', 'movie', 'much', 'shorter', 'books', 'therefore', 'many', 'people', 'events', 'places', 'had', 'been', 'ommited', 'case', 'obvious', 'effort', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'conserve', 'much', 'original', 'spirit', 'book', 'possible', 'efforts', 'were', 'mostly', 'successful', 'still', 'movie', ""n't"", 'rich', 'scope', 'book', 'mostly', 'relationship', 'Betty', 'surrounding', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'people', 'who', 'only', 'see', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'ups', 'downs', 'Betty', 'life', 'Iran', '3', 'Many', 'small', 'details', 'mentioned', 'book', 'are', 'missing', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'drastic', 'change', 'made', 'ending', 'readers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Betty', 'horse', 'ride', 'Iran', 'was', 'bad', 'winter', 'storm', 'not', 'desert', 'essence', 'dangerous', 'tiring', 'escape', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'Stuff', 'Mahtob', 'Betty', 'problem', 'typical', 'Iranian', 'restrooms', 'Betty', 'description', 'food', 'feasts', 'holidays', 'even', 'few', 'Farsi', 'words', 'once', 'while', 'book', 'bottom', 'line', 'book', 'adaption', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'special', 'features', 'documentary', 'THINK', ""'real"", 'Betty', 'participated', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'obthered', 'put', 'names', 'people', 'screen', 'introduce', 'advice', 'renting', '/', 'buying', 'DVD', 'borrow', 'Betty', 'book', 'library', 'complement', 'other']",N/A

293956,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6302067057,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[55, 64]","Based on Betty Mahmoody's account of her 18 months in Iran, this is a gripping, emotional roller coaster of a film that kept me riveted to the screen for all of its 115 minutes.Though fearful, Betty agreed to go for a two-week visit to Iran with her husband Moody and daughter Mahtob, only to find at the end of the two weeks that her husband was fired from his job in the US, and he has no intention of leaving Iran. Moody's family are primitive village people, very extreme in their views, and Moody, at first to ""save face"", and then perhaps degenerating into the man he was before being ""Americanized"", inceasingly controls Betty with force and humiliation, all within the Ayatollah Khomeni's insane and rigorous Islamic state of 1984.Her struggle to get out of Iran with her daughter is what this film is about (it would have been easy to leave alone), and there are many brave Iranians who risk their lives to help her. The claim that this film is racist is irrational, doesn't take these heroic people into consideration, and is an example of the narrow-minded intolerance shown in this film, a mindset that led to 9/11.Though made in 1990, this is a very timely film to watch, and relates to the problem of abuse in every culture. I don't understand why it has slipped under the radar screen and is not more widely known. The acting is excellent by the entire cast, and the direction by Brian Gilbert is tight and feels like a top-notch thriller at times, with Jerry Goldsmith's terrific score and Peter Hannan's wonderful cinematography, shot on location in Israel, which is fantastic in the last portion of the film.Sally Field and Alfred Molina give the performance of their lives, in what is much more than a ""woman's film""; this is a film about humanity and extraordinary courage, and should have a much wider audience than it has had.",5,a harrowing tale of a clash of cultures,1116892800,"05 24, 2005",2005,1848,"['Based', 'Betty', 'Mahmoody', 'account', '18', 'months', 'Iran', 'gripping', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'film', 'kept', 'riveted', 'screen', '115', 'minutes.Though', 'fearful', 'Betty', 'agreed', 'go', 'two-week', 'visit', 'Iran', 'husband', 'Moody', 'daughter', 'Mahtob', 'only', 'find', 'end', 'two', 'weeks', 'husband', 'was', 'fired', 'job', 'US', 'intention', 'leaving', 'Iran', 'Moody', 'family', 'are', 'primitive', 'village', 'people', 'very', 'extreme', 'views', 'Moody', 'first', 'save', 'face', 'then', 'perhaps', 'degenerating', 'man', 'was', 'being', 'Americanized', 'inceasingly', 'Betty', 'force', 'humiliation', 'Ayatollah', 'Khomeni', 'insane', 'rigorous', 'Islamic', 'state', '1984.Her', 'struggle', 'get', 'Iran', 'daughter', 'what', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'leave', 'alone', 'are', 'many', 'brave', 'Iranians', 'who', 'risk', 'lives', 'help', 'claim', 'film', 'racist', 'irrational', ""n't"", 'take', 'heroic', 'people', 'consideration', 'example', 'narrow-minded', 'intolerance', 'shown', 'film', 'mindset', 'led', '9/11.Though', 'made', '1990', 'very', 'timely', 'film', 'watch', 'problem', 'abuse', 'culture', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'slipped', 'radar', 'screen', 'not', 'more', 'widely', 'known', 'acting', 'excellent', 'entire', 'cast', 'direction', 'Brian', 'Gilbert', 'tight', 'feels', 'top-notch', 'thriller', 'times', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'terrific', 'score', 'Peter', 'Hannan', 'wonderful', 'cinematography', 'shot', 'location', 'Israel', 'fantastic', 'last', 'portion', 'film.Sally', 'Field', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'give', 'performance', 'lives', 'what', 'much', 'more', 'woman', 'film', 'film', 'humanity', 'extraordinary', 'courage', 'should', 'have', 'much', 'wider', 'audience', 'had']",N/A

293958,A1D6DFC3AGV3JZ,6302067057,Andrew Parodi,"[13, 17]","&quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot; is the true-life story of American Betty Mahmoody (Sally Field) who married an Iranian man who had moved the US. Together they had a daughter, Mahtob. The three pay a visit to the husband's native Iran, only to learn that it is not in fact a visit but that they are there to stay, and under Iranian law Betty automatically became an Iranian citizen once she married an Iranian man, and as a woman she does not have many of the rights she is accustomed to in the USA. Betty is trapped in a world she does not understand, and she wants to return to her home. She is told that she may return to the US, but must leave the daughter in Iran. She resolves that she will return but ... not without her daughter.I found ""Not Without My Daughter"" to be a gripping story because I could relate to what it is like to be in foreign lands and feel at the mercy of those around you, to be in a situation where not only do you not speak the language but the culture itself is alien. One realizes that ""reality"" is highly subjective. Also, a friend of mine lived through a very similar incident, albeit in the same country (luckily, my friend's father returned her to her mother in the USA). So, I myself cannot accuse this movie of being unrealistic or biased when I know that such incidents do occur. And I must add that ""Not Without My Daughter"" makes no secret of the fact that while it was Iranians who tried to prevent Betty Mahmoody from leaving Iran with her daughter, the people who aided Betty in doing so were also Iranian - and they are depicted as doing so at great personal risk and with no certainty of payment or personal benefit whatsoever.

This is the story of Betty Mahmoody (Sally Field), an American woman who married a naturalized American-Iranian named Moody and had an American-born daughter named Mahtob.Moody was a doctor working in a hospital in Michigan, but when the Shah fell and an Islamic fundamentalist regime was created, Moody decided he had to go visit his family and had to bring his wife and daughter along. Whether he actually intended it to be just a 2-week visit as he told her (swearing on the Koran) or whether he intended all along to stay in Iran is not clear. When they arrived in Tehran, his huge family all came to great them, and Betty was overwhelmed. She hated it, hated the way women were treated especially. It was nearly time for them to leave when he confessed to Betty that he had lost his job in Michigan two days before they left. He was determined to stay in Iran.Betty was a Christian, and continued to wear a small gold cross around her neck through the entire ordeal. And ordeal it clearly became as his family goaded him into becoming a very strict Muslim and insisting his wife go to Koran classes and his daughter enroll in a Muslim school. Betty was not to use the telephone, never go anywhere without her hair being covered completely, or indeed never go anywhere without a member of Moody's family. She begged him to let her leave, and she was told that if she divorced him she could leave, but that he would be granted custody of Mahtob. Hence the title of the movie.Despite the family spying on her constantly, she managed to make contact with people who could smuggle her and her daughter into Turkey where they could be safe at the American embassy. It was quite an adventure, but then just getting to the point where she could make contact with the people who helped her was adventure enough.Altogether a marvelous story.

Hustwick,"[7, 8]","""Not Without My Daughter"" is a stark portrayal of the treatment of women under Islam, and if you have a problem with it than you have a problem with proven facts that are not even denied by its adherents.  Women have next to no rights under Sharia law and this film, far from portraying all Iranians as brutal, shows the oppression and inhumanity  these people live under.  The film does not resort to generalizations or paint all Muslims with one brush.  Still, it would not be made this way today for we in the West have by and large turned to utter cowardice when dealing with these realities.Sally Field and Alfred Molina are both outstanding in the leads.  There is so much truth in the scene where Betty initially pleads for her freedom with her new ""family"" -- it is truly frightening.  I have known a fair number of Iranians and let me tell you that in my experience they are intense, strong-willed people...I can only imagine that this scene played itself out in real life much as it was starkly portrayed here.  But while I think that the overall PC criticism that the film is in some way racist or prejudiced is totally off the mark, I do think there was a missed opportunity to educate the audience more about Islamic culture and Persian history. And having read portions of the book, they do not suffer from the same melodramatic flair that marks the directing of this movie adaptation.Regardless, ""Not Without My Daughter"" is an effective film about basic human freedoms and American navet&eacute;; in real life, I am certain Moody was neither as charsmatic nor good looking as Alfred Molina, yet the hostile environment every bit as heinous as is portrayed on screen here.

The film has been referenced in the 1995 book by Geraldine Brooks:Nine Parts of Desire: The Hidden World of Islamic WomenThis book I had read after readingThe Trouble with Islam Today: A Muslim's Call for Reform in Her Faith. What's wrong with Islam? After reading the abovereferenced books and seeing this film it seems rather simple:  just marry an Islamic man (even if you yourself are American born) and find out--you will disappear as a human being! As Geraldine Brooks wrote in NINE PARTS OF DESIRE the enforced wearing of the hijab signifies an acceptance of a legal code that values ""a future domestic life in which her husband could beat her if she disobeyed him, make her share his attentions with three more wives, divorce her at whim and get absolute custody of her children.""Sally Field did an exceptional job of portraying Betty Mahmoody, the wife of an Iranian born American doctor who after agreeing to come to Iran to visit relatives finds herself trapped there with her seven-year-old daughter. She had made the nearly fatal mistake of trusting the man she loved who swore on the Koran before the family left the U.S. that they would be returning back to the United States after only a two week stay! The film is explicit on just how much courage and determination it took to escape the barbarism this poor woman was subjected to. I truly admire her for what she was able to accomplish.  Betty was lucky she made it out alive but just how many more were not so fortunate?  To think that there were as many American women there basically stripped of their rights as citizens of the United States simply because they married a Middle Eastern Islamic man is horrific.This film as much today as it did years ago impresses me just how careful one must be over who one marries. Thank God my husband, a fifth-generation German Irish Catholic and an American Army veteran has neve treated me in such an primitive and barbaric way.

The former secular milieu of the Shah is rapidly being replaced by Islamic nihilism.  A major war with Iraq is well underway and many Iranian boys sacrifice themselves as suicidal martyrs by clearing out minefields with their own bodies.  Sound familiar?  Betty Mahmoody's husband ""Moody"" doesn't hesitate to lie to her.  He felt that he had the full right to do so because she is both an infidel and a female.  Mrs. Mahmoody was told that the family was only going to spend two weeks in Iran.  It was only after she and her daughter Mahtob are trapped that the truth comes out.  They are going to remain in this male chauvinist and reactionary nation for the rest of their lives.  No longer is Moody pretending to be a liberated man.  He is now a wife beater and ruthless dictator.  The rest of the story revolves around how Betty Mahmoody escapes with the help of a number of liberal Iranians and other decent human beings.  We already know how the story will ultimately end, but our attention is still riveted to the screen.I did not see ""Not Without My Daughter"" when it first came out in 1991.  The central theme did not exactly entice my interest.  I was vaguely aware of Betty Mahmoody's plight due to numerous news programs.  However, what did that have to do with me?  Yes, I was the typical pre-9/11 naive fool who failed to realize the increasing threat of radical Islamism. Not Without My Daughter is a five star production.

293979,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6302067057,D. Litton,"[3, 5]","&quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot; is the true story of Betty Mahmoody, the wife of Iranian-American Moody, who wishes to pay a visit to his family back in Iran. Betty is highly skeptical about venturing to such a country, and is especially concerned about her daughter, but agrees to go with him, despite her reservations about the way of life of her husband's family and faith.What enfolds after this opener is a chilling and maddening film, one that provokes our deepest fears while also making us think about its tactics. The true story of Mahmoody is given a unique touch of suspense and drama, brought out by some very effective acting on the part of its leads. But in the end, once the brain is given time to think, I couldn't help but notice how one side gets a favorable treatment while the other is left in the cold.Sally Field plays Betty, who is treated very harshly once she arrives at her husband's family's home in Iran. She is not allowed to reveal her hair, must keep within the confines of the laws set forth for wives, and has virtually no power over that of Moody, who becomes increasingly cold. He soon decides that they will remain in Iran; when Betty rebels, he gives her the ultimatum of staying or leaving without their young daughter.And soon, Betty becomes increasingly unstable as she desperately searches for a way out of her situation, running the risk of being severely punished and physically brutalized by her now-changed husband. This is the point at which the movie becomes interesting yet frustrating. The frustration stems from the movie's unwillingness to show us both sides of the spectrum, only allowing the movie to be seen through Betty's point of view, without so much as a glance at the background of the beliefs her husband holds to so strongly.I can understand the reasons for which this portrayal has taken such a path: it does offer a very chilling atmosphere of the unknown into which Betty is cast. But, at times, it seems as if the harsh portrayal of the Iranian belief system is unfair and unjustifiable, while at other times providing for some very solid entertainment.There's no denying the movie's grip on the audience; it's a highly tense story that unfolds very effectively. Field throws everything she's got into her performance, empowering her character with true terror and, at the same time, a sense of inner will and strength that's completely believable.

This is the true story of Betty Mahmoody, an american woman that went to Iran with her daughter to visit the husband's family. Her iranian husband later told her that the supposed ""visit"" is actually a moving and if she doesn't want to stay then she will suffer the consequences or she can just return to United States BUT WITHOUT HER DAUGHTER. Lucky for her, she found some friendly iranians that help her out because the U.S.A. cannot do anything for her because of the iranian laws.

I don't think that way because the story makes a lot of sense to me in the basic point of view. NOW! Bad testimonies can be harmful for the reputation of a person, family, race or culture, but THAT doesn't mean that the story was made in the name of evil or harm. Every kind testimony doesn't necessarily represent realism, it represent the point of view of the fact lived by that person. Sometimes testimonies can be graphic, but it's the way that they are described, nobody can describe the way that everybody wants because each person is an individual. I think that everybody just perceive things the way they do, not the way that OTHER people do.I guess that one the messages of this movie is that if you are going to get married to someone that comes from a entire different culture then you must know about his culture and not think of that person as somebody from your own culture.Adios.",5,One of the most controversial and suspenseful dramas ever!!!!,1272672000,"05 1, 2010",2010,1930,"['MAAAN', 'movie', 'REALLY', 'shocked', 'never', 'seen', 'suspenseful', 'drama', 'Midnight', 'Express', 'true', 'story', 'Betty', 'Mahmoody', 'american', 'woman', 'went', 'Iran', 'daughter', 'visit', 'husband', 'family', 'iranian', 'husband', 'later', 'told', 'supposed', 'visit', 'actually', 'moving', ""n't"", 'want', 'stay', 'then', 'will', 'suffer', 'consequences', 'can', 'just', 'return', 'United', 'States', 'BUT', 'WITHOUT', 'HER', 'DAUGHTER', 'Lucky', 'found', 'friendly', 'iranians', 'help', 'out', 'U.S.A.', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'because', 'iranian', 'laws', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'escape', 'Iran', 'return', 'U.S.A.', 'daughter', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'cast', 'chilling', 'scrip', 'amazing', 'how', 'testimonies', 'can', 'later', 'turn', 'great', 'movie', 'also', 'hard', 'do', 'movies', 'controversies', 'also', 'important', 'learn', 'facts', 'not', 'just', 'ignore', 'them.NOTE', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'saying', 'movie', 'racist', 'lie', 'nationalits', 'propaganda', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'way', 'story', 'lot', 'sense', 'basic', 'point', 'view', 'NOW', 'Bad', 'testimonies', 'can', 'be', 'harmful', 'reputation', 'person', 'family', 'race', 'culture', 'THAT', ""n't"", 'mean', 'story', 'was', 'made', 'name', 'evil', 'harm', 'kind', 'testimony', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'represent', 'realism', 'represent', 'point', 'view', 'fact', 'lived', 'person', 'testimonies', 'can', 'be', 'graphic', 'way', 'are', 'described', 'nobody', 'can', 'describe', 'way', 'everybody', 'person', 'individual', 'think', 'everybody', 'just', 'perceive', 'things', 'way', 'do', 'not', 'way', 'OTHER', 'people', 'do.I', 'guess', 'one', 'messages', 'movie', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'married', 'someone', 'entire', 'different', 'culture', 'then', 'must', 'know', 'culture', 'not', 'think', 'person', 'somebody', 'own', 'culture.Adios']",N/A

She then turns to an underground chain of helpers to escape. Due to Iranian laws it details how if Betty leaves her daughter behind then she would automatically be giving up her rights to the child.

293990,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,6302067057,JGC,"[14, 17]","""Not Without My Daughter"" is an enthralling movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Two-time Oscar-Winner, Sally Field plays suburban homemaker, Betty Mahmoody. Betty is the typical American woman: educated, intelligent and very determined. When her husband (Alfred Molina plays the corrupt, Moody) tricks her into going back to his homeland, the oppressive and desolate Iran, she validly has her trepidations.Eventually, Betty agrees to go on a short trip to Iran with Moody and their young daughter because her husband was able to convince her that no harm would come to them. Keep in mind that this took place during the mid 80's; smack dab in the middle of the Iran-Iraq War and right after the harsh sanctions of the Iran Revolution.Betty abruptly learns that they're no longer in Kansas when Moody's old-maid spinster-sister orders him to have her put on a chador (this is that very dismal looking cloak that Iranian women are forced to wear against their will because their society is terrified of anything that is remotely sexual.) Moody's sister, Ameh Bozorg, was played by the very talented Mony Rey. I think it was established during the beginning of the movie that Ameh Bozorg was only 58 (or maybe younger?) but she looked like she was 80 if she was a day. She played the miserable, prudish, Persian family matriarch to the letter. It was never established, but I think ""Ameh"" may have been a title bestowed to Moody's sister out of respect. In Arabic Umpto means paternal aunt and is sometimes used as a term of respect. Although, the Persian Language (Farsi) is very different.Even though the customs are very different from what Betty is used to(for example, everyone eats on the floor,) she's determined to try make the best of it. So, Betty puts on a happy face and dances; but it is apparent that she can't wait to leave. Frankly, who would want to stay in a place like this? Betty also notices some subtle changes to her husband during this time. First, he becomes more withdrawn from her. Then he starts snapping at her when she questions the ridiculous prayer rituals of this fundamentalist clan (they get up in the middle of the night to pray, of course the men are separated from the women.) Then Moody tells Betty that he was fired from his job (he was employed as a doctor in a suburban Detroit hospital) right before they left for Iran. This is likely a lie as there was no mention of this in the storyline to indicate that this really happened.On the day everyone was supposed to go home Moody gives Betty the tragic news. They are not going back to MI. In fact, both Betty and her daughter must stay in Iran since they are now the legal ""property"" of her husband! This scene was especially thought-provoking. Imagine someone who you love very much was holding you in a third-world country against your will with your child. How would you react? Sally Field had such a determined and brave response. When Betty stood up to her husband he did what most Iranian men do to their wives when they are faced with adversity; he beat her in the face. What a coward.Betty tries to get solace from Moody's family. This was a very bad decision. I don't know why she thought they would help her because Ameh Bozorg turned them all against her. Probably because Betty was a beautiful American woman that was free-spirited. Maybe desperate times call for desperate measures and Betty was hoping that someone would help her? When it's apparent that she is stuck in this dump she retreats and becomes very depressed. Even Moody, her wife-beater husband tries to cheer her up.The only person that gave Betty the drive to press on was her daughter, Mahtob. Sheila Rosenthal performed the role of Mahtob with such talent and finesse. It's hard to believe that she was only 9 or 10 because she was so intelligent. Mahtob was such a sweet and kind-hearted little girl, wise beyond her years. When Moody started calling Betty ""stupid"" it was so cute to see her tell him that her mother wasn't stupid. So, for the sake of her daughter, Betty does regain her strength to try to find a way home.Back in MI, Betty's mother contacts Betty with a glimmer of good news. When Betty hears her voice she breaks down in tears. Again, Sally Field was utterly perfect. I am always so amazed at how this actress can transform into a completely different person as she did in this movie. Betty's mother informed her that Iran doesn't have a US embassy (what a shocker!) so her only hope is to visit the Swiss embassy. All of a sudden Moody comes in to the kitchen (where Betty was, of course it goes without saying that this was the only phone in the house) and sees Betty talking on the phone. He is in enraged. Oh, did I forget to tell you? Besides being held against her will, Betty can't leave the house and can't use the phone. Moody pushes his hostage, oh I mean his wife away from the phone and warns her never to pick it up again.Finally, Betty and Mahtob make the courageous escape to the Swiss embassy. This is such a bittersweet moment. Because one would think that they would be at least on their journey home. Right? Not so. Nicole Amjahmian (Sarah Badel) informs Betty that just because she wants to go home doesn't mean she can. And it doesn't mean they can help her physically get out of the country. Besides making phone calls and passing on messages Nicole's hands were tied. She also tells Betty that since she married an Iranian man she automatically became an Iranian citizen. Betty would have to go back to her husband; she had zero options.When Betty arrives back at Ameh Bozorg's dilapidated hovel (where they're all still staying) Moody is seething in a rage. All of a sudden he comes out of nowhere and starts screaming: where were you. Suffices it to say, he starts beating her and pummeling her with slaps. Poor Betty couldn't fight back. She was like a cornered fly. She was totally defenseless. All she could do was fall to the ground in hysterical sobs.After Mahtob's first birthday in Iran, Moody arrogantly enrolls Mahtob in school. Needless to say, because of her new surroundings Mahtob is terrified in her new school. No one speaks English and the customs and practices are beyond sublime (like her mother, Mahtob was also forced to keep her hair covered!) On her first day of school, Moody has to pick Mahtob up early because the poor thing would not stop crying; and who could blame her? (I'm sure most adults would be in shambles if they were forced to go to an Iranian school against their will; now picture how traumatic this would be to a small child!) So, Betty is asked to go with Mahtob the following day and stay in the building so her daughter would feel more comfortable.As Betty was in the school there was a horrible explosion that caused complete pandemonium. All the students and teachers came running out of the classrooms in all different directions. Maybe they should have had a bomb shelter or at the very least some type of drill so everyone would have known what to do because this was a fairly common occurrence. When Moody came to pick up Betty she pleaded with him not to force Mahtob to go back to that school. Moody had the unmitigated gall to blame the explosion on the US. In fact, Moody was the type of man that liked to shift all the blame onto others for all of his problems. He blamed everyone but himself when he couldn't find a job. He blamed Americans for his own country's civil war. He blamed the US when Betty's family had his assets frozen. Alfred Molina played the part of this misogynistic monster exceptionally.Months go by and Betty is still trapped against her will. Nothing has changed, though. Except maybe now Betty has started to get a little complacent. I don't know if this is a good thing or not. Because Moody isn't as rigid or tight-fisted with her. They finally move out of Ameh Bozorg's and in with Moody's brother and sister-in-law. Nasserine (played by Soudabeh Farrokhnia), Betty's sister-in-law, was the only member of her husband's family that showed her a little bit of courtesy and sympathy. And wasn't she absolutely beautiful? Of course, since Nasserine was a woman, she was absolutely powerless to intervene in any way. But it was still refreshing for Betty to see a kind face among all these other miserable and hateful sourpusses, namely Ameh Bozorg.Betty finally meets a gentleman who may be able to help her. He specializes in smuggling hostages out of Iran. But now it becomes a race against time for Betty and Mahtob to get out of the country, alive. Because Moody wants to send Betty back to the US (without her daughter, of course) to unfreeze and liquidate all of their assets. But Betty refuses to leave without Mahtob. She is determined to bring both herself and her daughter home safely. If nothing else, Sally Field proved that a mother's love is never compromised.Betty's last couple of days in Iran were very suspenseful because everything was so unexpected. Moody was called into work at the last minute which gave Betty a very small window of opportunity. You will root for Betty during her entire ordeal as she gets to her ""safe house."" I loved it when Betty called Moody to tell him she wasn't coming back (this was done to bide some time.) You can hear Sally's feisty voice, now it's Betty's turn to show her husand her rage. And after being his hostage for 18 months she rightfully had a lot of animosity. Of course Moody was furious that his wife would dare disobey him. He was totally livid but always indignant as he screamed to Betty through his family's antiquated (even for a third-world country) rotary phone: you're my wife, I don't have to explain anything to you.As you know, eventually Betty and Mahtob do make it out of Iran safely. The movie does end in somewhat of an anti-climactic way. I believe it was more due to logistics. It ended with Betty seeing an American flag in Turkey, holding her daughter; both tired, and alone. Betty's book (which this movie was based on) was much more descriptive, so perhaps I was expecting a little more. I believe Betty has since said that because of the snow and the time of year the filming location had to be moved and certain aspects pertaining to the final scenes had to be rewritten for continuity. Nevertheless, it was still a first-rate film.Why is this story so motivational and so incredibly uncommon?Being taken to Iran and held against her will, like Betty was, is not unique, unfortunately. This happens every day to thousands of women and children. But what is unique is that Betty and Mahtob were able to get out safely.In 1948 the United Nations General Assembly came up with a list of human rights which are (supposed) to be guaranteed for every single human being; all over the world, in every single country. This very basic list is called the ""The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,"" and countries such as Iran have consistently chosen to ignore these basic human rights.This is the first time a woman has ever escaped the harsh rule of Iran with her child, and lived to tell their story. Forget about the fact that women have no rights and are property (owned by their husbands, fathers or brother-in-laws) who cannot travel without explicit permission. The fact of the matter is that just making the pilgrimage from Iran to Turkey in the winter (as Betty and Mahtob did) can be very dangerous and even deadly. It was a miracle for something like this to happen.For more than 15 years I have studied the Middle East. This entire region of the world has always been very captivating to me. Partly because I find the customs and the people to be very beautiful and fascinating. I have learned how terse and arbitrary this part of the world tends to be, though. And, I have learned that Iran is very different from any other country in the Middle East. Iran is one of the most repressive and harshest countries in the entire world. As I stated, women have zero rights. But it's not just women that are subjected to this torturous way of living. When the Iranian President recently told Columbia University that there are ""no homosexuals in Iran"" I had to laugh at his blatant homophobia, hatred and disregard to human life. What a sick and bigoted statement to make. This just goes to show the type of backwards system that makes up the Islamic Republic of Iran. All of the homosexual men and lesbian women living in Iran during this modern-day Holocaust have my deepest sympathy. I know that they are living through their own hell right this moment, at the hands of a nation that says they don't even exist!If you enjoyed this movie, you would love Betty's book,Not Without My Daughter. You may also want to read,Out of Iranby Sousan Azadi. I also recommend picking up Betty's second book,For the Love of a Child. And if you're interested in books on the Middle East in general (not specifically Iran), I also recommendSold: One Woman's True Account of Modern Slavery,Princess: A True Story of Life Behind the Veil in Saudi ArabiaandBurned Alive: A Survivor of an ""Honor Killing"" Speaks Out.In her book, Betty said that after she and her daughter first saw this movie they both cried. All the events of their capture came back to them since the movie was so true to life. The real Betty was in Israel (where the movie was filmed,) during the production of this movie. And the real Mahtob even has a small part as one of the children.

Houzet ""wozamoya""","[46, 55]","Strangely enough, this was one of those movies I thought was ""ho-hum, boring, a chick-flick"" at the time it was released back in 1990. Seeing it later made me change my mind. It is the engaging true story of a woman who suffers abuse at the hands of her husband, but who is ultimately a survivor and even a warrior. Man, do you end up cheering for her. The added dimension is that the abuse she suffers is condoned by the country and political-religious system in which she was living at the time - Shi'ite Iran.I believe this is a very true depiction of life for a woman in fundamentalist Muslim cultures, especially a western woman who is not used to submitting to oppressive cultural and marital demands. Wearing a burqa was the least of Betty Mahmoody's troubles - her husband, who initially appeared tolerant and even westernized while he was living in America, changes into a control freak when he returns to Iran with his wife and young daughter. I felt some sympathy for the husband due to the fact he appears initially reluctant to dominate Betty in the way his family and culture expects, but he was either fooling us all along, or he was very weak-minded and completely unfaithful to his vows to love and honor his wife by treating Betty so viciously.Betty is at first incredulous about her husband's expectations, but when he starts beating her she learns to be docile while planning an escape for her and her daughter. It was amazing to see in the family situations how Iranian women are so indoctrinated by their culture that they too become oppressors, of other women and anyone who is not being Islamic enough.Fortunately there are other heroes in this story besides Betty - Iranian dissidents who help her plan and execute an escape, at great risk to their own lives.",5,"An engaging, forthright movie",1049760000,"04 8, 2003",2003,1784,"['Strangely', 'enough', 'was', 'one', 'movies', 'thought', 'was', 'ho-hum', 'boring', 'chick-flick', 'time', 'was', 'released', 'back', '1990', 'Seeing', 'later', 'made', 'change', 'mind', 'engaging', 'true', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'abuse', 'hands', 'husband', 'who', 'ultimately', 'survivor', 'even', 'warrior', 'Man', 'do', 'end', 'up', 'cheering', 'added', 'dimension', 'abuse', 'condoned', 'country', 'political-religious', 'system', 'was', 'living', 'time', ""Shi'ite"", 'Iran.I', 'believe', 'very', 'true', 'depiction', 'life', 'woman', 'fundamentalist', 'Muslim', 'cultures', 'especially', 'western', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'used', 'submitting', 'oppressive', 'cultural', 'marital', 'demands', 'Wearing', 'burqa', 'was', 'least', 'Betty', 'Mahmoody', 'troubles', 'husband', 'who', 'initially', 'appeared', 'tolerant', 'even', 'westernized', 'was', 'living', 'America', 'control', 'freak', 'when', 'Iran', 'wife', 'young', 'daughter', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'husband', 'due', 'fact', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'dominate', 'Betty', 'way', 'family', 'culture', 'was', 'either', 'fooling', 'along', 'was', 'very', 'weak-minded', 'completely', 'unfaithful', 'vows', 'love', 'honor', 'wife', 'treating', 'Betty', 'so', 'viciously.Betty', 'first', 'incredulous', 'husband', 'expectations', 'when', 'beating', 'be', 'docile', 'planning', 'escape', 'daughter', 'was', 'amazing', 'see', 'family', 'how', 'Iranian', 'women', 'are', 'so', 'indoctrinated', 'culture', 'too', 'become', 'oppressors', 'other', 'women', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'being', 'Islamic', 'enough.Fortunately', 'are', 'other', 'heroes', 'story', 'Betty', 'Iranian', 'dissidents', 'who', 'help', 'plan', 'execute', 'escape', 'great', 'risk', 'own', 'lives']",N/A

The aim of this movie seems to see how much they can rip apart Iranian culture. What they don't mention is that this story takes place during the Iraq-Iran war, and naturally, things are going to be a little more tense and abnormal. There is a scene of a night bombing, but the fact that the nation is at war is never really discussed. Iran itself was also in a flux, with its new government only a few years old, so things also really hadn't settled down yet. But the producers never see the need to tell us anything at all about Iran.It is also shocking that Betty married this Iranian man, without learning anything at all about his culture, his religion or even the laws of his country. And it would seem that their marital problems went deeper than just cultural differences--if they had been blissfully happy together, surely he would have discussed the matter over with her--why he wanted to stay in Iran, and so on, instead of just demanding it.Yes, there was quite a bit missing from this movie, but then, it was made in Israel so that may be the reason it is so utterly bigoted against Iran, and leaves out all the important details which may have better explained the situation--both in Iran and within the couple's marriage.",2,Not worth your time,978998400,"01 9, 2001",2001,1336,"['gave', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'only', 'Sally', 'Field', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'script', 'was', 'given', 'aim', 'movie', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'rip', 'apart', 'Iranian', 'culture', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'story', 'place', 'Iraq-Iran', 'war', 'naturally', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'tense', 'abnormal', 'scene', 'night', 'bombing', 'fact', 'nation', 'war', 'never', 'really', 'discussed', 'Iran', 'was', 'also', 'flux', 'new', 'government', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'old', 'so', 'things', 'also', 'really', 'had', ""n't"", 'settled', 'down', 'yet', 'producers', 'never', 'see', 'need', 'tell', 'anything', 'Iran.It', 'also', 'shocking', 'Betty', 'married', 'Iranian', 'man', 'learning', 'anything', 'culture', 'religion', 'even', 'laws', 'country', 'would', 'seem', 'marital', 'problems', 'went', 'deeper', 'just', 'cultural', 'differences', 'had', 'been', 'blissfully', 'happy', 'together', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'discussed', 'matter', 'why', 'wanted', 'stay', 'Iran', 'so', 'instead', 'just', 'demanding', 'it.Yes', 'was', 'quite', 'bit', 'missing', 'movie', 'then', 'was', 'made', 'Israel', 'may', 'be', 'reason', 'so', 'utterly', 'bigoted', 'Iran', 'out', 'important', 'details', 'may', 'have', 'better', 'explained', 'situation', 'Iran', 'couple', 'marriage']",N/A

294001,A14A4YYKPLYY26,6302067057,LactivistAnti-VaccineLiberal,"[3, 8]","First, let me preface this review by saying that before I saw this movie, I had already qread the book by Betty Mahmoody, which this movie is based on. The book was very detailed, and fairly intense, so when I saw the movie, I was somewhat disappointed to see the truth in the statement that &#34;Movies are Never as Good as the Actual Book&#34;Still it was an okay movie, though nothing very great or special.When I first saw this movie, I was still growing up (in my preteens/teens) and at that time I thought it was a better movie than I do now, even though I have not seen it again recently, so this opinion is in retrospect.In my opinion, there was a LOT of room for improvement in this movie.First of all, I don't think that Sally Field was a good casting choice for the role of Betty Mahmoody. In this movie, just like in some of her other work (Eye for An Eye, etc.) Sally majorly overacts, making this particular character come off as a spoiled, whiny, elitist American, and precisely the what those in the Middle East, and the rest of the world detest about America.Now, Alfred Molina, who played Betty's husband Moody, acted very well, but he too was also an entirely wrong casting for the role, because he is nothing like the real-life Moody, either in stature, size or appearance, giving viewers an utterly false, misleading idea of the physical differences between Betty and her husband. As a result, in the movie, the situation was manipulated and exaggerated towards Betty's point of view, so that viewers will immediately and automatically support and defend her, when in reality, there are two sides to every story, including this one - the other side which has not been shown until recently.What I'm referring to is this.When I first saw the movie, I was still in my early to mid preteens (12-13). Because of that I was still somewhat naive, and believed things I was told, and saw, without always verifying it for accuracy and factual basis.So when I read the book, and saw the movie, I immediately believed that, what happened in the book and movie really actually happened, and I never bothered to question it.Even though a Iranian friend who watched the movie with me one time, and claimed that life was not really like that in Iran, and that most Iranian people did not act like that, I was not so sure.Then recently, in the last few years, I started Googling, and doing other research online and offline, into the story of Betty Mahmoody. Because her daughter, Mahtob, is just a year younger than me and they were originally from the general area that I lived/live in, I felt a sort of connection, and was interested in finding out where they were/are and what's been happening with them now, in the years, and over a decade since the movie came out.So I started looking them up both on and offline, and what I found out was eye-opening, and has made me question the truth of the very basis of the movie and book.First of all, in the book and movie, Moody is portrayed to be this big, strong, powerful guy who physically attacked his wife, Betty and daughter, Mahtob.In reality, Moody, is a fairly short and small (smaller in size and stature than even Betty!) soft-spoken guy, who looks like he couldn't harm a flea (and even if he did, couldn't hurt him much!) Betty is nearly double the size/strength of this man, and there is no way that he could physically attack her in any way that could cause the harm that she has described in her book, and shown in the movie.A while back, Betty's ex-husband, Moody, came out with a film of his own side of the story, called &#34;Without My Daughter&#34; that was produced by a Swiss production company. In the movie, he shows himself as the soft-spoken, gentle, kind man that he probably is who just loves and misses his daughter, and longed to see her before he died (and which sadly, he never got the chance to, dying in August 2009 without having any contact with his daughter since January 1986)Furthermore, UNLIKE Betty who relies solely on sensationalism & stereotypes, Moody has NUMEROUS witnesses, including friends of Betty's, who are both in Iran and in America (and while it could reasonablybe claimed that Betty's friends in Iran - especially her female friends, might have motive to lie for Moody in fear of retaliation by him or his family or even the Iranian government or Islamic clerics, WHAT POSSIBLE REASON could Betty's friends who are living in America where they are in no danger as in Iran, have to lie???)  who ALL adamantly state that Betty had WILLINGLY agreed to relocate to Iran with her husband and daughter, and that she had also been given the option of returning to the US whenever she wished, both with and without her daughter Mahtob.Personally, I think that Betty Mahmoody is just a bitter, spoiled American woman, who willingly went to Iran with her husband and daughter, thinking that she would have all the luxurious creature comforts available to her in America, and when she realized she couldn't hack it in Iran, instead of just coming home where she would have to work and make her own living, she instead stayed in Iran, so she could be supported by her husband, and live off his money, in relative luxury.I mean, just read the description in the book of the HUGE mansion that Moody bought her in Iran after they moved out of his relatives homes -- as well as her constant greedy statements about all the lavish gold jewelry and fancy clothes that Moody showered on her & Mahtob while at the same time, selfishly complaining (like a petulant bratty child throwing a tantrum over an expensive toy their parent refuses to buy) about Moody refusing to buy her & Mahtob expensive strawberries (likely because the fruit was out of season)Then when her husband asked her to return to America to liquidate their assets so that he could have the funds to continue to support her in her exorbitant lifestyle, she got mad, and ran away, taking their daughter with her.So she turned Mahtob against her father and she came back to the US. But with her &#34;sugar daddy&#34; no longer around to support her, she had to find another means of gold-digging. So she found another get-rich-quick scheme by selling the rights to her story and scapegoating her husband, Iran, and the Muslim world in general!!For example, in her book, Betty makes the ludicrous, offensive & highly prejudicial claim that Iranians don't bathe or shower for weeks or months portraying them as dirty stinky people, who live in filthy homes crawling with bugs, and yet, they could care less. It is an outright LIE!Iranians DO bathe regularly. Granted, not all Iranians choose to bathe with a private shower or bath in their own homes -- and instead they prefer to go to the &#34;hammam&#34; or &#34;hammoom&#34; (or whatever it's called) which is a public bath-house, where they can meet their friends (just like at the local gym/club in this country), and bathe together while socializing, swimming and drinking tea with their friends. But just because some Iranians think that private showed & bathtubs in individual homes is wasteful, and they would rather bathe in a communal setting with friends, does NOT mean that Iranians don't bathe like Betty not only implied but outright falsely claimed! In fact, Islam REQUIRES that people bathe/shower after engaging in sexual activity. So Betty's claims are despicable unfounded lies and it would be laughable if it weren't so sad, the way she slanders an entire population of people that for the most part, are already unfairly maligned (because people are not their governments) in the mediaBetty just played up her role as the &#34;poor American woman oppressed by the big bad, mean old Iranian husband and government&#34;, which the US media just ate up, hook, line & sinker, even in the pre 9/11 world. So by playing &#34;victim&#34;, Betty has gotten books published and a movie out of the deal which I'm sure has her just about rolling in the bucks now.Meanwhile, Moody was an aging, frail, sickly, and lonely man who would've done anything to see his daughter again before he died, But sadly, he never got the chance to -- and died all alone in August 2009, longing for his daughter. Because Betty brainwashed Mahtob into thinking her father is a cruel, controlling, and violent man, Mahtob and her dad lost any chance to reunite & reconcile after years of separation and estrangement.Way to go, Betty Mahmoody! Nice job at totally obliterating your daughter's relationship with her dad over money!Well, what goes around, comes around, and whether it's through a Heaven & Hell, or whether it's through the karma of reincarnation & rebirth into a lower life form, and/or worse life circumstances, or whatever other belief, the fact is that one way or another, eventually, we all pay for our sins & misdeeds -- and that includes YOU, Betty Mahmoody!If there really is such a thing as Heaven, then one day Moody and Mahtob will be reunited there, and Mahtob will see for herself how much her father truly loved her, and how he yearned to see her and talk to her till his dying day. At that time, she will learn the truth about how you stole her from her father and brainwashed her into believing her father was a monster, and the Devil Incarnate!And while Mahtob & Moody will be together forever in Heaven, you will be in an entirely different, and far less pleasant place for all eternity -- and it will serve you right!",1,Sensationalist & Stereotypical

He wants to go back to Iran, so she agrees with him (thinking it is only temporary, and unaware of the reality of Iran and what it is like for women there)Once she gets there, she realizes she has walked into a trap. Her husband also does a near-180 spin personality-wise, becoming more like the stereotypical tyrannical Muslim husband, and since she is a woman, the wife lacks opportunities that were taken for granted in America. She is desperate to go back (and take her daughter with her) but Hubby says no, and under Iranian law, she is pretty much screwed.Of course, she refuses to give up, and is determined to have a better life for herself and her daughter, which is what this story centers on (as if the title wasn't hint enough) Overall it's actually a pretty great movie, I just wish the ending could have been longer and more substantial.",4,Good role for Sally Field,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",2011,1000,"['movie', 'set', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'aftermath', 'Iran', 'Revolution', 'stars', 'Sally', 'Field', 'American', 'woman', 'who', 'Iranian', 'man', 'go', 'back', 'Iran', 'thinking', 'only', 'temporary', 'unaware', 'reality', 'Iran', 'what', 'women', 'there', 'there', 'walked', 'trap', 'husband', 'also', 'near-180', 'spin', 'personality-wise', 'becoming', 'more', 'stereotypical', 'tyrannical', 'Muslim', 'husband', 'woman', 'wife', 'opportunities', 'were', 'taken', 'granted', 'America', 'desperate', 'go', 'back', 'take', 'daughter', 'Hubby', 'Iranian', 'law', 'pretty', 'much', 'screwed.Of', 'course', 'give', 'up', 'determined', 'have', 'better', 'life', 'herself', 'daughter', 'what', 'story', 'centers', 'title', 'was', ""n't"", 'hint', 'enough', 'Overall', 'actually', 'pretty', 'great', 'movie', 'just', 'wish', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'more', 'substantial']",N/A

As each layer of comfort is peeled away, you suddenly realize what the true value of a single relationship truly is.

294009,A1KI6L82M5RAHQ,6302067057,mr. snrub,"[3, 6]","Shortly before the realease of NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER in 1991, Roger Ebert wrote this article regarding the movies supposedly anti-Muslim status: If a society does not allow its women to speak to men other than their husbands, or own property, or vote, or drive cars, or appear in public unless covered in traditional dress from head to toe, or take trips without written permission, or have any rights to their children, and if that society nods approvingly when a husband beats his wife when she disobeys these rules--is that society sexist? Or are we racist to think so?Now, ol' Roger himself came to view the movie as a piece of Anti-muslim propaganda, but at least he made the effort to lok at both sides of the issue. aybe he just endded up sour grapes because it was released so soon before the Gulf War (You know, the one where Saddam actually was doing something evil, during the presidency of the Bush who actually WAS elected.)I'll get to all that in a moment. NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER is the true story of Betty Mahmoody (Sally Field), who is convinced by Muslim husband Moody (Alfred Molina, warming up for his role as Doc. Ock in SPIDER-MAN 2) to take a two-week vacation to Iran- one of the most fundamentalist Muslim countries in the world. She is reluctant at first, but after he swears on the Koran that nothing bad will hapeen , she agrees, and the two of them, along with their absolutely adorable daughter, five year-old Mahtob (Sheila Rosenthal), go to Iran.Betty doesn't adjust well at all. She is told if she doesn't wear the traditional female Muslim garments outside at all times, she'll arrested; she gets annoyed at Moody having to wake up a five A.M. to face Mecca in one of his five prayers each day; she eventually decides Iran is a ""backward, primitive country."" But then Moody drop the bombshell: he informs Betty and Mahtob htey will not be returning to the U.S., and they are both essential his prisoners,bouhnd by Islamic law to obey his every command. Betty, of course, won't stand for this and makes every effort possible to escape, to no avail. She is told that by marrying an Iranian, she is automatically and Iranian citizen and is bound by Islamic law. Moody is permitted-indeed ENCOURAGED- to beat Betty into submission after ever attempt she makes to escape, which he does.NOT WITTOUT MY DAUGHTER is not simple pure entertainment. It is an extremely well-made movie, but is the kind of movie that is inseperable from the debate in will engender: Are Muslims sexist, extremist, religious fanatics? Now, this movie is not the one that will create debates about overzealous Muslims (although some would just call them zealous) commiting acts of terrorism- leave that to TRUE LIES. But now over four years after the tragedy of 9/11/01, we must have the debate.I'll start with my own views.I am one with the belief that the majority of Muslisms in this world are not extremists. We must not chastise the majority for the actions of the few. I also believe that, though a minority, there are enough extremist Muslims and countries governed by Islamic law to be cause for concern. Iran is only one of these. They also include, but aren't limited to, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan (at least, before the Taliban were driven out), Palestine, and others throughout the Middle East.Besides be a good, suspensing, entertaining movie, NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER is a fervent reminder of this.",5,Being truthful doen't mean being anti-muslim,1135296000,"12 23, 2005",2005,3415,"['Shortly', 'realease', 'NOT', 'WITHOUT', 'MY', 'DAUGHTER', '1991', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'wrote', 'article', 'regarding', 'movies', 'supposedly', 'anti-Muslim', 'status', 'society', 'not', 'allow', 'women', 'speak', 'men', 'other', 'husbands', 'own', 'property', 'vote', 'drive', 'cars', 'appear', 'public', 'covered', 'traditional', 'dress', 'head', 'toe', 'take', 'trips', 'written', 'permission', 'have', 'rights', 'children', 'society', 'nods', 'approvingly', 'when', 'husband', 'wife', 'when', 'rules', 'society', 'sexist', 'are', 'racist', 'think', 'so', 'Now', 'Roger', 'came', 'view', 'movie', 'piece', 'Anti-muslim', 'propaganda', 'least', 'made', 'effort', 'lok', 'sides', 'issue', 'aybe', 'just', 'endded', 'up', 'sour', 'grapes', 'was', 'released', 'so', 'soon', 'Gulf', 'War', 'know', 'one', 'where', 'Saddam', 'actually', 'was', 'doing', 'something', 'evil', 'presidency', 'Bush', 'who', 'actually', 'WAS', 'elected', ""'ll"", 'get', 'moment', 'WITHOUT', 'MY', 'DAUGHTER', 'true', 'story', 'Betty', 'Mahmoody', 'Sally', 'Field', 'who', 'convinced', 'Muslim', 'husband', 'Moody', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'warming', 'up', 'role', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'SPIDER-MAN', '2', 'take', 'two-week', 'vacation', 'Iran-', 'one', 'most', 'fundamentalist', 'Muslim', 'countries', 'world', 'reluctant', 'first', 'Koran', 'nothing', 'bad', 'will', 'hapeen', 'two', 'absolutely', 'adorable', 'daughter', 'five', 'year-old', 'Mahtob', 'Sheila', 'Rosenthal', 'go', 'Iran.Betty', ""n't"", 'adjust', 'well', 'told', ""n't"", 'wear', 'traditional', 'female', 'Muslim', 'garments', 'outside', 'times', ""'ll"", 'arrested', 'annoyed', 'Moody', 'having', 'wake', 'up', 'five', 'A.M.', 'face', 'Mecca', 'one', 'five', 'prayers', 'day', 'eventually', 'Iran', 'backward', 'primitive', 'country', 'then', 'Moody', 'bombshell', 'Betty', 'Mahtob', 'htey', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'returning', 'U.S.', 'are', 'essential', 'prisoners', 'bouhnd', 'Islamic', 'law', 'obey', 'command', 'Betty', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'effort', 'possible', 'escape', 'avail', 'told', 'marrying', 'Iranian', 'automatically', 'Iranian', 'citizen', 'bound', 'Islamic', 'law', 'Moody', 'permitted-indeed', 'ENCOURAGED-', 'beat', 'Betty', 'submission', 'ever', 'attempt', 'escape', 'WITTOUT', 'MY', 'DAUGHTER', 'not', 'simple', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'extremely', 'well-made', 'movie', 'kind', 'movie', 'inseperable', 'debate', 'will', 'engender', 'Are', 'Muslims', 'sexist', 'extremist', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'Now', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'create', 'debates', 'overzealous', 'Muslims', 'would', 'just', 'call', 'zealous', 'commiting', 'acts', 'terrorism-', 'leave', 'TRUE', 'LIES', 'now', 'four', 'years', 'tragedy', '9/11/01', 'must', 'have', 'debate.I', ""'ll"", 'start', 'own', 'views.I', 'am', 'one', 'belief', 'majority', 'Muslisms', 'world', 'are', 'not', 'extremists', 'must', 'not', 'chastise', 'majority', 'actions', 'few', 'also', 'believe', 'minority', 'are', 'enough', 'extremist', 'Muslims', 'countries', 'governed', 'Islamic', 'law', 'be', 'cause', 'concern', 'Iran', 'only', 'one', 'also', 'include', 'are', ""n't"", 'limited', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Afghanistan', 'least', 'Taliban', 'were', 'driven', 'out', 'Palestine', 'others', 'Middle', 'East.Besides', 'be', 'good', 'suspensing', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'NOT', 'WITHOUT', 'MY', 'DAUGHTER', 'fervent', 'reminder']",N/A

However, if you take notice when he does go back to Iran that his family is constantly on his case about living in the United States for so long and not staying with his family. He is placed in the middle between his american family and even his american values and his traditional values of iranian life. It is then the change comes.If you remember Betty meets briefly with a woman who tells her that beating a woman is not Islamic. That's right it is not Islamic. So, what she is saying, that many men take their own faith and do with it as it pleases them and uses the suras from the Qu'ran as a way to control their some of their women. However, by telling Betty this- she now knows there's more to Moody than him just being in Iran. He knows she doesn't know anything about the Qu'ran and basically helpless to go against his word. So if you read the book, you will see she uses that as a way for to gain his trust. She must conform to escape. You see a little of this in the movie when she goes to Qu'ran classes and says the prayer at her birthday.The movie gets 4 stars because it is a good movie and can educate you only of you are open to learn. Or you can view this movie and get upset and tell everyone you are right about how it is in the Middle East. However, unless you view this objectively, you will only base this movie on your own opinions and not on what is actually being seen.I recommend you read both books by Betty MahMoody and then view the movie.I am not agreeing with domestic violence it is wrong and those who use this should be punished.

I remember coming out of the movie theater being profoundly grateful for the things those who live in a free society take for granted == being able to drive where we choose without showing passports or being stopped at checkpoints to justify our travel, being able to wear what we choose, to have certain basic civil rights.  And of course for women, the ability to drive a car, have a checkbook, live an independent life.I don't think this shows a one sided view of Iran.  Many moderate and thoughful Iranians were showed in the movie, and even those who were supporters of the oppressive system often tried to help Betty and clearly showed their disapprobation of Moody's violence and of some of the extremes of the regime. the book goes even further into that.  I didn't take away any impression that all Iranians or even most were bad, only that the extremist regime is certainly bad for woman and children. Those who are slamming the book and the movie for that are clearing ignoring those parts of the book and movie to further their own one sided views.I don't think this is an anti-Muslim movie.  Nothing in that religion says that women should be held at gunpoint for their scarf slipping, or that their husbands have the right to beat them.  In fact, the movie has a line where one character says that such beatings are forbidden by that faith.  All religions can be used to the wrong purpose, and pretty much all religions have when taken up by extremists, either Islamic or Christian.  It isn't Islam that is portrayed as villanous in this movie, nor even Iran, but only this extremist regime.This is a movie to make you appreciate freedom and tolerance, and respect for others. Because we see what happens when society looses that basic tenant.As for Moody's complaints that his child was stolen from him, part of the reason Betty left was that he repeatedly took Mahtob away from her, and keep threatening to do so permanently. Apparently he felt justified in stealing her from his wife, something she wouldn't have done had he been truthful and decent. And expecting his American wife and child to relocate to the very anti-american Iran and to expect Betty to be happy exposing her child to living in a war zone and being raised in an oppressive regime was ridiculous.  Betty had justifiable fears for them both. Any society that holds a woman at loaded gunpoint in front of her young daughter for having a scarf slip is not one that a mother would feel safe raising a child within. Any husband that beats his wife and child, and threatens to kill his wife, does not deserve his wife and child.  And this was done repeatedly in front of witnesses.As for the DVD, I am disappointed that there are no extras regarding the making of the movie.  It would have been nice to have some background extras about Iran during that period, about the regime, about the reasons for making the movie and what as chosen and abandoned from the book, etc.  In a book and movie that was meant to be educational as well as entertainment, that's an opportunity lost.  Especially as so many of the reviewers of this movie seemed to have missed some essential points, or prefer to overlook them.  We're supposed to apparently excuse Moody's dishonesty, his threats, his beating of his wife and child, his imprisonment of his wife, and using his child as a weapon and a hostage from her because he takes advantage of the license allowed him by a fanatical regime to lie to, kidnap and abuse his family.  It's ridiculous for him to expect sympathy for loosing his child when he created the very situation that caused his wife to flee for her life and the life of her child.  He apparently had no qualms about taking Mahtob away from Betty, or Betty away from her family and her dying father.I found this movie difficult to watch at times, because it was personally painful to watch Betty when she was trapped and desperate.

Sally Fields outdid herself with her amazing performance in this film about an American wife and mother who hesitantly goes on vacation in Iran to please her Iranian husband then becomes entrapped when he refuses to let her return to the U.S. with her daughter.  The film is based on a true story from the book written by Betty Mahoody.  This was truly an award winning performance on Sally Fields behalf and a film that brings accurate reality to Americans as to how vulnerable we become once we are on foreign soil.  The story is riveting as Betty Mahoody attempts to escape Iran several times with her daughter, Mahtob, and ends up caught in the act where she suffers abuse and isolation from her husband as punishment.  Finally she enables the help of a sympathetic Iranian shopkeeper who connects her to the right friendly outsider to assist in escaping, only to discover that her husband has foiled her plans with the intention of sending her off to America without her daughter.  Desperate to keep her child, Betty finds a much more dangerous method of escape and must travel over warring territories by truck and horse until both she and her daughter are finally dropped on Turkey's doorstep and out of harm's way.

I highly recommend it.,5,Incredible,1275004800,"05 28, 2010",2010,480,"['was', 'blown', 'away', 'movie-', 'Producers', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'repressive', 'Iranian', 'regime', 'incidentally', ""n't"", 'changed', 'whole', 'lot', '80s', 'took', 'away', 'rights', 'women', 'had', 'read', 'enough', 'first', 'hand', 'accounts', 'women', 'Middle', 'East', 'know', 'very', 'factually', 'acurate', 'movie', 'Watch', 'see', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'are', 'women', 'Middle', 'East', 'not', 'just', '80s', 'also', 'today', ""n't"", 'changed', 'one', 'bit', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Yes, Islamic Iran is no paradise and it is awful but the depiction of it the way it is shown in this movie is inaccurate and offensive. I won't give more than one star to this movie.
