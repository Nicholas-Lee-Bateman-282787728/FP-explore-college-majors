At the peril of his life he defied the Nazis innumerable times. Read a summary of Wallenberg's unbelievable courage to save Hungarian Jews on Google: ""Profile of a Leader: The Wallenberg Effect."" See Wallenberg's complete story in the book ""Righteous Gentile"" available used from amazon.com from a number of book dealers for one cent plus $3.99 for shipping and handling. EVERY reviewer gave the book 5 stars! Unlike Schindler, Wallenberg had only his humanity and no ulterior motive in saving Jews; and he probably saved more Jews than Schindler.Few Motion pictures can compare to the book. The motion picture ""Wallenberg: A Hero's Story"" may even be equal to the book ""Righteous Gentile""! Both the book and the movie will lift your very being to heaven. Man at his best is so good, so noble, so Christ like, that we would throw a cover over men and women when they are less. Mankind needs Hero's like Wallenberg to lift and redeem us. It will make anyone a better person to make the book or the motion picture a part of their life.See all of my Reviews.

1412304,A1CZKOSULDV3VT,B004KL0OVU,Literato,"[1, 12]","First off, this was an EMBARRASSING experience. We all agree about Wallenberg's [pronounced VOLLEN-berry] intelligence and amazing heroism. If he didn't he should have won a Nobel Peace Prize. He is a breathtaking inspiration for decent, principalled people everywhere. Let's start our dissection with the script - it is schlocky, dumbed-down, with often inadvertently hilarious [take for example the appallingly humorous rendition of Shtormy VED-derr] sequences. Humor and forced levity are injected at intervals to lighten up the gravity of the genocidal subject matter, but this is inappropriate, because mass murder isn't comical. The characters are very tinker-toy and what they say is mechanical and for the most part unconvincing. The Jewish people are depicted here [just as the Nazis characterized them] as ragtag, sloppy and dirty. Only the Hungarian wasps and S.S. are well dressed. Think of these comments as you revisit the docudrama and you'll see what I'm talking about.Now for casting... Wallenberg was wealthy and privileged, but, alas, not handsome. Why cast a pretty boy who has poor acting skills to play a hero? This is not some one who could pull off charm, moral strength, resolve, or intimidation. Shouting at appropriate times doesn't cut it... If you needed a heartthrob, Paul Newman would have been a far better choice. Let's look at the character Fodor: he stands around in many scenes wearing an arrow cross uniform and carrying a rifle. What did he accomplish to move the script along? He never saves or helps anyone.If the British could bypass their anti-Semitism for a brief moment, maybe they could do justice to this great man, for they are the greatest theatre craftsmen on the planet. The very dry, pale film with Stellan Skarsgard is far more serious and believable than this deplorable kitschwerk.And if you are curious about what I did after seeing this parody of a moral icon...

1412320,A3373I4II32NA1,B004KL0OVU,Tyler,"[19, 19]","I am watching this movie while I even type this. For a few years, I was aware of who Raoul Wallenberg was, a Swedish secretary with the Swedish embassy in Hungary during World War Two, saving thousands of Jews from the last Nazi-dominated country to start up deportations of their Jewish population in early to late 1944. Sadly, he was arrested, thrown into prison, and died in captivity by the RUSSIANS of all people! The Russians, despite his protective status as a Swedish diplomat, accused him as a spy and had him killed. But I NEVER was made aware that a movie was made about Wallenberg in his honor! This movie came out when I was born, but it might as well be a brand-new movie anyway, which I rate at five stars. The movie goes a lot into the discussion of how Hungary's leader, Admiral Horthy, would purposely suspend deportations of Jews by the thousands despite the growing demands from Nazi Germany and Colonel Eichmann of the SS to deport the 250,000 remaining Jews in the Budapest area alone, and how Wallenberg would risk a lot for his own safety to save as many of the Jews as he could by employing them at the Swedish embassy and making safe houses that would fly the Swedish flag. This movie is completely excellent, all 3 hours of it, and is well worth the money spent and the time used in watching it.
