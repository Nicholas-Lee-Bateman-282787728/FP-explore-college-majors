1273378,A2EY9XBUKASAQT,B002JYPV7C,InPursuitofGentleWholeness,"[3, 3]","This tape is done in sections: standing poses, backbends, etc. Its done in a silent black background with voice over. The camera angle changes throughout the pose. The voice-over is Jason. The poses are described VERY WELL with a gotcha explained such as 'if your low back still feels compressed....drop your tailbone further or come out of the pose slightly.'' Very good. I will use this to take me from advanced beginner to intermediate levels, playing the tape once a week to refine my knowledge of how to do the poses correctly.
