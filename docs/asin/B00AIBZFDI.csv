The pace of the plot, the intensity of the characters, and the ""on track"" trajectory of the dialogue make this segment of the adventure far more worthwhile.In a previous review, I stated that 'Part I' was lackluster, and Ayn Rand would have shuddered at its production.  However, part of my basis was on how she reacted to the celluloid version of 'The Fountainhead,' starring Gary Cooper, but her main contention was with the change of lines which took a lot of the spirit from her protagonist's centerpiece speech. I also cited the lack of fire portrayed in the characters, the gratuitous expletives, and the overall lack of zest put into the first installment.Here they've upped the quality and have harnessed the spirit of her epic novel far better.  Maybe even having Samantha Mathis at the helm, injecting a true spirit into protagonist, Dagny Taggart (instead of Taylor Schilling, who seemed too cold and steely in demeanor) and adding name actors like Diedrich Bader (as Quentin Daniels) and Ray Wise (from 'Twin Peaks - The First Season (Special Edition)as Head of State Thompson).  As lesser names, Patrick Fabian is a silver-tongued weasel (enough for James Taggart), and Paul McCrane is officiously offensive as the government nemesis, Wesley Mouch. However, it is Duncan Jones's directing (replacing Paul Johansson) which should get front and center credit for making the deliberations so ably paced that make this portion of 'Atlas Shrugged' gets back on its rails and deliver the goods.  (Puns intended.)It is hard to imagine what proceedings will take us into 'Part III,' (Only for those who have read the book know what I mean), but 'Part II' can only have us hoping for more of the same.*'Passion' is taken from Barbara Branden's biography of Ayn Rand entitled 'The Passion of Ayn Rand'.",3,'Part II' is on Track for Ayn Rand's 'Passion'*,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,1873,"[""'Atlas"", 'Shrugged', 'Part', 'II', 'honed', 'far', 'better', 'predecessor', 'pace', 'plot', 'intensity', 'characters', 'track', 'trajectory', 'dialogue', 'make', 'segment', 'adventure', 'far', 'more', 'worthwhile.In', 'previous', 'review', 'stated', 'was', 'lackluster', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'would', 'have', 'shuddered', 'production', 'However', 'part', 'basis', 'was', 'how', 'reacted', 'celluloid', 'version', ""'The"", 'Fountainhead', 'starring', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'main', 'contention', 'was', 'change', 'lines', 'took', 'lot', 'spirit', 'protagonist', 'centerpiece', 'speech', 'also', 'cited', 'lack', 'fire', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'gratuitous', 'expletives', 'overall', 'lack', 'zest', 'put', 'first', 'installment.Here', ""'ve"", 'upped', 'quality', 'have', 'harnessed', 'spirit', 'epic', 'novel', 'far', 'better', 'Maybe', 'even', 'having', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'helm', 'injecting', 'true', 'spirit', 'protagonist', 'Dagny', 'Taggart', 'instead', 'Taylor', 'Schilling', 'who', 'seemed', 'too', 'cold', 'steely', 'demeanor', 'adding', 'name', 'actors', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'Quentin', 'Daniels', 'Ray', 'Wise', ""'Twin"", 'Peaks', 'First', 'Season', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Head', 'State', 'Thompson', 'lesser', 'names', 'Patrick', 'Fabian', 'silver-tongued', 'weasel', 'enough', 'James', 'Taggart', 'Paul', 'McCrane', 'officiously', 'offensive', 'government', 'nemesis', 'Wesley', 'Mouch', 'However', 'Duncan', 'Jones', 'directing', 'replacing', 'Paul', 'Johansson', 'should', 'get', 'front', 'center', 'credit', 'making', 'deliberations', 'so', 'ably', 'paced', 'make', 'portion', ""'Atlas"", 'Shrugged', 'back', 'rails', 'deliver', 'goods', 'Puns', 'intended', 'hard', 'imagine', 'what', 'proceedings', 'will', 'take', 'III', 'Only', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'know', 'what', 'mean', ""'Part"", 'II', 'can', 'only', 'have', 'hoping', 'more', 'same', ""*'Passion"", 'taken', 'Barbara', 'Branden', 'biography', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'entitled', 'Passion', 'Ayn', 'Rand']",Atlas Shrugged II: The Strike

Both movies pretty much follow the book.  Considering when she wrote this book, it's amazing how close we might be to experiencing the story she tells.  The book(and movie) starts in part 1 in Sept 2016.  While I had no trouble following part 1, having read the book, I wonder if the viewer can follow part 2 without seeing part 1 and/or reading the book.  Movie is well done and I love the stupidity of big government and the subborn resistance of those who represent personal responsibility and initiative.  Part 2 ends  before the end of the book's story so maybe another part will be coming.  Having read the book, however, they may have to improvise a movie ending to the story.

Naturally the book was better, but the screenwriters have done an outstanding job in encapsulating her writing and getting to what's important. Sadly we will not see the end of the series until near summer of 2014, although I am sure it is worth waiting for...We may well see what Capitalism is capable of, something the Government cannot nor will try in both the film, as it is here in today's U.S. That is the Private Sector can do anything with the best of innovation, and do it better, faster, and safer that any Union or Government sponsored jobs.In world of Atlas Shrugged, the Government is in trouble, but those in the &#34;underground&#34;  have the answer, but the problem is, will it change minds? There is always a better way than an oppressive government as time immortal has proven over and over again throughout history. Their way is not working (no big surprise to those who have common sense), many do not realize their is a difference between plain Democracy and a Democratic Society (Libya and Egypt are Democracies for example), which is what they are dealing with in Shrugged. Is John Galt a person, a way of life...or both?Do not allow yourselves to think with a new cast of characters and new director that this movie is any less that Part 1, just the opposite, they are more suited to the roles than in #1. The look and tone of the film is outstanding, and made to be believable, the first one was no doubt good, however this one is much more convincing are real, as with any good series, it will leave you wanting more, as it should. I am normally one who wants it all at once, not wanting to wait, although it does make the wait worthwhile in building anticipation for the final episode and it makes you think of the scenario's of what will happen...part oft he appeal.This is one of the reasons for the Five Star review, these have been done so well, the only thing we know now, is that the screenplay is already written, though prone to some changes, with some scenes already being filmed, I do not think we will have much or any character changes in the final of the three movies.

However, the plot is the little told consequences of a socialistic state were those who do not produce expect to share in the rewards of those who do. The plot brings to mind the old fables about the ""Ant and the Grasshopper.""  Also, the fable of the chicken who planted the grain, cared for the gain, harvested the grain, milled the grain, and baked the bread, while no one else wanted to help. However, in the end, everyone wants to partake of the fruits of chickens hard work.  Of course, she refuses to share with those who refused to share in the labors that made the bread possible.This is the moral of Atlas Shrugged. Those who do the labor deserve to reap the rewards of their labor. And, those who refuse to labor will suffer the consequence of their slothfulness. Some will find the underlying philosophy of the movie to be disturbing and selfish. For in the plot those who produce feel no obligation to share with those who do not. Just as in those old fables, those who do not labor to contribute to their own welfare suffer the dire consequences of their own actions or lack of actions to save themselves.The movie use the events of the last few years to demonstrate how, author, Ayn Rands vision of the future is at hand.  The movie shows protesters outside of the offices of major industries holding signs saying, ""We are the 99%."" The movie's philosophy see these protesters as those who use the products which are created and produces by the hands of others, but then, also want to share in the profits of the labors of others.During the last election, President Obama, told a gathering of his supporters, ""That businesses own them (the supporters) a share of the businesses' profit because without them buying their products/services those businesses would not be successful. Ayn Rand's vision of the futures has become today's political reality. Today, the chicken would be forced to share the fruits of her labors, with those who refuse to labor at all. And, then, those who refused to labor would take the profit the chicken had earn for herself. Leaving the chicken with little reason to produce in the future.When Ayn Rand's vision of the future becomes today, Atlas, Shrugged, and asked, ""Who is John Galt?""",4,Ayn Rand's Future is now,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,2342,"['plot', 'one', 'dimensional', 'address', 'only', 'one', 'side', 'story', 'Big', 'Government', 'intrusion', 'big', 'business', 'However', 'plot', 'little', 'told', 'consequences', 'socialistic', 'state', 'were', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'produce', 'expect', 'share', 'rewards', 'who', 'do', 'plot', 'mind', 'old', 'fables', 'Ant', 'Grasshopper', 'Also', 'fable', 'chicken', 'who', 'planted', 'grain', 'cared', 'gain', 'harvested', 'grain', 'milled', 'grain', 'baked', 'bread', 'one', 'else', 'wanted', 'help', 'However', 'end', 'everyone', 'partake', 'fruits', 'chickens', 'hard', 'work', 'course', 'share', 'who', 'refused', 'share', 'labors', 'made', 'bread', 'possible.This', 'moral', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'who', 'do', 'labor', 'deserve', 'reap', 'rewards', 'labor', 'who', 'refuse', 'labor', 'will', 'suffer', 'consequence', 'slothfulness', 'will', 'find', 'underlying', 'philosophy', 'movie', 'be', 'disturbing', 'selfish', 'plot', 'who', 'produce', 'feel', 'obligation', 'share', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'Just', 'old', 'fables', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'labor', 'contribute', 'own', 'welfare', 'suffer', 'dire', 'consequences', 'own', 'actions', 'lack', 'actions', 'save', 'themselves.The', 'movie', 'events', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'author', 'Ayn', 'Rands', 'vision', 'future', 'hand', 'movie', 'protesters', 'offices', 'major', 'industries', 'holding', 'signs', 'saying', 'are', '99', '%', 'movie', 'philosophy', 'see', 'protesters', 'who', 'use', 'products', 'are', 'created', 'produces', 'hands', 'others', 'then', 'also', 'want', 'share', 'profits', 'labors', 'others.During', 'last', 'election', 'President', 'Obama', 'told', 'gathering', 'supporters', 'businesses', 'own', 'supporters', 'share', 'businesses', 'profit', 'buying', 'products/services', 'businesses', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'successful', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'vision', 'futures', 'become', 'today', 'political', 'reality', 'Today', 'chicken', 'would', 'be', 'forced', 'share', 'fruits', 'labors', 'who', 'refuse', 'labor', 'then', 'who', 'refused', 'labor', 'would', 'take', 'profit', 'chicken', 'had', 'earn', 'herself', 'Leaving', 'chicken', 'little', 'reason', 'produce', 'future.When', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'vision', 'future', 'today', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'asked', 'Who', 'John', 'Galt']",Atlas Shrugged II: The Strike

Director John Putch is a strictly color by numbers guy.That said, most won't be watching it for it's artistic merits. It's about The Message- in this case Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism.

I viewed this when it was released into theatres.This part depicts the United States' further decline into the depths of economic despair.  And it shows how increasing government oppression causes the decline to accelerate, even as more and more producers and innovators disappear from industry.The acting is good to very good.  Samantha Mathis brings a more dynamic range of acting skills to Dagny Taggert.

It is an in-your-face depiction of liberty vs. tyranny, and how an overbearing government impoverishes, and then destroys everyone.

1610854,APBRAL723MUM4,B00AIBZFDI,EJon,"[2, 4]","[spoilers]In my review of the first part of Atlas Shrugged, I described it as ""better than I expected"", and I was honestly looking forward this installment. I guess it's roughly as good as the first.  On the positive side, some things actually *happen* in this movie, which is a step up, but other things pull it down, so it's kind of a wash.First, although it takes up where the first left off, all the actors have magically changed - and for the most part they're worse than the originals.  I actually liked the first Hank Rearden, but this guy is smug jerk who goes through the whole movie with a superior smirk frozen on his face.  Dagny has bags under her eyes and a permanently strained look that I couldn't help but interpret as menstrual cramps.  The smoldering passion between the two of them that was in the book went from lukewarm in the first part to nonexistent in the second. While we're on that subject, the makers shied away even more from Rand's penchant for rough sex, and toned things down even more than first, which was already strictly Hallmark Channel to begin with.The Wesley Mouch of the first movie really captured the insidious evil of the character Rand had written, while this guy's just kind of annoying. One of the only ones who did a halfway good job was the guy who played Ken Dannager, the coal magnate, but he has a small part and disappears around the middle.  The only truly good casting was Dagny's brother. Rand would have been pleased.Easter Egg alert: keep an eye out for a short cameo by Teller (of Penn and Teller) - in a speaking role!The movie also abandons the atmosphere of the first, so now it looks more like ""the future"" than a weird alternate history of the 50s.  This arguably makes more sense, but it also loses some of the charm of the first - and charm is in short enough supply.  It also makes it even more implausible that railroads are suddenly so important again.Rand has a rather simple point to make, and she doesn't believe in subtlety.  In the first move, she makes her point by repeating things, and in this one, she does it by getting sillier and sillier, and her plot is even more ridiculous as a movie than in print.Things pick up a bit with some dramatic tension after Dagny goes on vacation and the railroad begins to fall apart.  This is the high point of the movie and it's actually pretty good for a while.  Here, the movie actually makes its point in the action, rather than by preaching, but it's too little to late.Those who have read the book will recognize the beginning as foreshadowing Dagny's arrival in ""Galt's Gulch"", which gives you hope you will actually see their vision of Rand's Utopia.  Unfortunately, the movie ends with that arrival, so you'll have to tune in for the third installment - presumably with totally different actors and settings - for the payoff.Once more, the movie is pulled down by slavish devotion to the book.  Rand believed that great men could follow many paths: engineers, scientists, artists, architects, businessmen, authors, musicians...pretty much anything by comedians.  Like the book, and all her books, there's not a trace of humor in the movie.  The closest thing to a ""joke"" is when Francisco D'Anconia sets fire to his mines to bankrupt his investors.  Yup, a real knee-slapper that one.  He is polite enough to warn Rearden (making it both arson *and* insider trading) - and of course nobody else matters.Even so, although Rand's writing is devoid of humor, she at least gave them a certain ""joie de vivre"" that's totally lacking in the movie.  The actors deliver their lines, economic lectures, and sermonettes without a trace of joy or passion.It struck me that James Taggart's wedding is a good representation of the movie as a whole.  If listening to a political debate at a wedding reception is your idea of a good time, then you'll probably love this movie.  Otherwise, like me, you'll probably want to shout ""lighten up"" at several points.Still, if you watched the first one, you'll probably want to watch this one, and if you watch this one, you'll find yourself hoping they'll finish the trilogy.  I want to see their vision of Rand's Utopia.  Personally, I've always wondered who cleans the toilets in a society populated entirely by arrogant supermen.",3,Both better and worse than the first,1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,4284,"['[', 'spoilers', ']', 'review', 'first', 'part', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'described', 'better', 'expected', 'was', 'honestly', 'looking', 'forward', 'installment', 'guess', 'roughly', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'positive', 'side', 'things', 'actually', '*happen*', 'movie', 'step', 'up', 'other', 'things', 'down', 'kind', 'wash.First', 'up', 'where', 'first', 'left', 'off', 'actors', 'have', 'magically', 'changed', 'most', 'part', ""'re"", 'worse', 'originals', 'actually', 'liked', 'first', 'Hank', 'Rearden', 'guy', 'smug', 'jerk', 'who', 'whole', 'movie', 'superior', 'smirk', 'frozen', 'face', 'Dagny', 'bags', 'eyes', 'permanently', 'strained', 'look', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'interpret', 'menstrual', 'cramps', 'smoldering', 'passion', 'two', 'was', 'book', 'went', 'lukewarm', 'first', 'part', 'nonexistent', 'second', ""'re"", 'subject', 'makers', 'shied', 'away', 'even', 'more', 'Rand', 'penchant', 'rough', 'sex', 'toned', 'things', 'down', 'even', 'more', 'first', 'was', 'already', 'strictly', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'begin', 'with.The', 'Wesley', 'Mouch', 'first', 'movie', 'really', 'captured', 'insidious', 'evil', 'character', 'Rand', 'had', 'written', 'guy', 'just', 'kind', 'annoying', 'One', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'did', 'halfway', 'good', 'job', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'Ken', 'Dannager', 'coal', 'magnate', 'small', 'part', 'middle', 'only', 'truly', 'good', 'casting', 'was', 'Dagny', 'brother', 'Rand', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pleased.Easter', 'Egg', 'alert', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'short', 'cameo', 'Teller', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'speaking', 'role', 'movie', 'also', 'atmosphere', 'first', 'so', 'now', 'more', 'future', 'weird', 'alternate', 'history', '50s', 'arguably', 'more', 'sense', 'also', 'charm', 'first', 'charm', 'short', 'enough', 'supply', 'also', 'even', 'more', 'implausible', 'railroads', 'are', 'suddenly', 'so', 'important', 'again.Rand', 'rather', 'simple', 'point', 'make', ""n't"", 'believe', 'subtlety', 'first', 'move', 'point', 'repeating', 'things', 'one', 'getting', 'sillier', 'sillier', 'plot', 'even', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'print.Things', 'pick', 'up', 'bit', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'Dagny', 'vacation', 'railroad', 'fall', 'apart', 'high', 'point', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'while', 'Here', 'movie', 'actually', 'point', 'action', 'rather', 'preaching', 'too', 'little', 'late.Those', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'recognize', 'beginning', 'foreshadowing', 'Dagny', 'arrival', 'Galt', 'Gulch', 'hope', 'will', 'actually', 'see', 'vision', 'Rand', 'Utopia', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'arrival', ""'ll"", 'have', 'tune', 'third', 'installment', 'presumably', 'totally', 'different', 'actors', 'settings', 'payoff.Once', 'more', 'movie', 'pulled', 'down', 'slavish', 'devotion', 'book', 'Rand', 'believed', 'great', 'men', 'could', 'follow', 'many', 'paths', 'engineers', 'scientists', 'artists', 'architects', 'businessmen', 'authors', 'musicians', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'comedians', 'book', 'books', 'not', 'trace', 'humor', 'movie', 'closest', 'thing', 'joke', 'when', 'Francisco', ""D'Anconia"", 'fire', 'mines', 'bankrupt', 'investors', 'Yup', 'real', 'knee-slapper', 'one', 'polite', 'enough', 'warn', 'Rearden', 'making', 'arson', '*and*', 'insider', 'trading', 'course', 'nobody', 'else', 'matters.Even', 'so', 'Rand', 'writing', 'devoid', 'humor', 'least', 'gave', 'certain', 'joie', 'de', 'vivre', 'totally', 'lacking', 'movie', 'actors', 'deliver', 'lines', 'economic', 'lectures', 'trace', 'joy', 'passion.It', 'struck', 'James', 'Taggart', 'wedding', 'good', 'representation', 'movie', 'whole', 'listening', 'political', 'debate', 'wedding', 'reception', 'idea', 'good', 'time', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'movie', 'Otherwise', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'shout', 'lighten', 'up', 'several', 'points.Still', 'watched', 'first', 'one', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'watch', 'one', 'watch', 'one', ""'ll"", 'find', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'finish', 'trilogy', 'want', 'see', 'vision', 'Rand', 'Utopia', 'Personally', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wondered', 'who', 'toilets', 'society', 'populated', 'entirely', 'arrogant', 'supermen']",Atlas Shrugged II: The Strike

1610882,A2KTUL1TPTGWIX,B00AIBZFDI,"Jack Treese ""Jack""","[12, 22]","When Atlas Shrugged was greenlit for a film adaptation, I had strong hopes for it while at the same time hoping that it would evenly work out.  Part 1 was released last year to nearly unanimous critical scathing, but I actually really enjoyed it.  Though some elements were removed or completely modernized, I thought the character buildup was strong and the ending was spot-on, making for the rare example of a Hollywood film nearly matching up with the novel.  With that being said, I was excited that Part 2 was being made after I had heard rumblings that the other parts would be canceled.Then, the big day arrived.  More negative reviews came out, which I immediately dismissed.  Then roughly two hours later I left the theater actually agreeing entirely with the negative reviews.  While Part 1 was a very well-made first effort, Part 2 is where Atlas not only shrugs, but falls flat on his face in the process.Where do I start... first and foremost, I knew walking in that there would be different actors and I actually thought it might work out.  However, the moment I heard Hank Rearden speak for the first time I began laughing to myself.  I know Grant Bowler may not have had the most charismatic voice in the world, but Jason Beghe sounds like he chain-smoked unfiltered cigarettes between breaks.  If you're gonna cast different actors in a sequel, at least pick someone that slightly resembles the last guy.Speaking of, what's up with Eddie?  He looks like he outta nowhere grew taller, lost his hair and went to the gym.  Maybe I'm just nitpicking at this point, but it's still true.  The only bright side to the acting, dare I say it, was that Samantha Mathis was a much better Dagny Taggart than Taylor Schilling.The story is kind of hard to explain if you haven't seen Part 1 or read the novel (which is the much better route), so I'll sum up the middle-part the best that I can:  A steel magnate and a railroad owner are trying to analyze a prototype motor, while the owner's brother is in cahoots with the government to take Rearden Steel completely off the market through a Fair Share law.  The government does other ridiculous stuff too, and more CEOs and creators disappear.  See?  Kinda hard to explain, because you're most likely reading this trying to make sense of it.I guess I'd have to say that the only positive quality the film had was that thanks to the increased budget, there were better visual effects this time around.  It's nothing that cinema-goers haven't seen already, but still surprising to say the least.Who would I recommend this film to?  Only to the most ardent of Ayn Rand fans.  I enjoy the novel Atlas Shrugged, but Part II is an absolute train-wreck (no pun intended for those who've seen it).  It's not a train-wreck worth looking at either.  Without going into a lengthy debate about it, I personally believe this is one of those novels that shouldn't be filmed.  It has a powerful message that eerily resembles what's happening today; however, it's more well-read than it is to be seen.I have my hopes that Part III will see Atlas make a recovery from this stumble, but I'm not counting on it.",2,"As a fan of Part 1, Part 2 is extremely underwhelming.",1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,3146,"['When', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'was', 'greenlit', 'film', 'adaptation', 'had', 'strong', 'hopes', 'same', 'time', 'hoping', 'would', 'evenly', 'work', 'out', 'Part', '1', 'was', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'nearly', 'unanimous', 'critical', 'scathing', 'actually', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'elements', 'were', 'removed', 'completely', 'modernized', 'thought', 'character', 'buildup', 'was', 'strong', 'ending', 'was', 'spot-on', 'making', 'rare', 'example', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'nearly', 'matching', 'up', 'novel', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'excited', 'Part', '2', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'had', 'heard', 'rumblings', 'other', 'parts', 'would', 'be', 'canceled.Then', 'big', 'day', 'arrived', 'More', 'negative', 'reviews', 'came', 'out', 'immediately', 'dismissed', 'Then', 'roughly', 'two', 'hours', 'later', 'left', 'theater', 'actually', 'agreeing', 'entirely', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Part', '1', 'was', 'very', 'well-made', 'first', 'effort', 'Part', '2', 'where', 'Atlas', 'not', 'only', 'shrugs', 'flat', 'face', 'process.Where', 'do', 'start', 'first', 'foremost', 'knew', 'walking', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'actors', 'actually', 'thought', 'might', 'work', 'out', 'However', 'moment', 'heard', 'Hank', 'Rearden', 'speak', 'first', 'time', 'began', 'laughing', 'know', 'Grant', 'Bowler', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'most', 'charismatic', 'voice', 'world', 'Jason', 'Beghe', 'chain-smoked', 'unfiltered', 'cigarettes', 'breaks', ""'re"", 'gon', 'cast', 'different', 'actors', 'sequel', 'least', 'pick', 'someone', 'slightly', 'last', 'guy.Speaking', 'what', 'up', 'Eddie', 'nowhere', 'grew', 'taller', 'lost', 'hair', 'went', 'gym', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'nitpicking', 'point', 'still', 'true', 'only', 'bright', 'side', 'acting', 'dare', 'say', 'was', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'Dagny', 'Taggart', 'Taylor', 'Schilling.The', 'story', 'kind', 'hard', 'explain', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Part', '1', 'read', 'novel', 'much', 'better', 'route', 'so', ""'ll"", 'sum', 'up', 'middle-part', 'best', 'can', 'steel', 'magnate', 'railroad', 'owner', 'are', 'trying', 'analyze', 'prototype', 'motor', 'owner', 'brother', 'cahoots', 'government', 'take', 'Rearden', 'Steel', 'completely', 'market', 'Fair', 'Share', 'law', 'government', 'other', 'ridiculous', 'stuff', 'too', 'more', 'CEOs', 'creators', 'disappear', 'See', 'Kinda', 'hard', 'explain', ""'re"", 'most', 'likely', 'reading', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'it.I', 'guess', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'only', 'positive', 'quality', 'film', 'had', 'was', 'thanks', 'increased', 'budget', 'were', 'better', 'visual', 'effects', 'time', 'around', 'nothing', 'cinema-goers', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'already', 'still', 'surprising', 'say', 'least.Who', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'Only', 'most', 'ardent', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'fans', 'enjoy', 'novel', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'Part', 'II', 'absolute', 'train-wreck', 'pun', 'intended', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'train-wreck', 'worth', 'looking', 'going', 'lengthy', 'debate', 'personally', 'believe', 'one', 'novels', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'filmed', 'powerful', 'message', 'eerily', 'what', 'happening', 'today', 'however', 'more', 'well-read', 'be', 'seen.I', 'have', 'hopes', 'Part', 'III', 'will', 'see', 'Atlas', 'make', 'recovery', 'stumble', ""'m"", 'not', 'counting']",Atlas Shrugged II: The Strike

I suppose there was a good reason for changing actors for all of the primary roles in the middle of the story, but I can't imagine what it was. It was very disconcerting, to say the least. Once I picked up the story line again, I waited to be swept up into the world of Ayn Rand, but I found the characters to be wooden and the dialogue to be pretentious and awkward. The Rearden and D'anconia actors were okay in their roles, but the new Dagney Taggart lacked the gravitas and presence of the original.The line ""Who is John Galt"" was heard much more often, but with little explanation or clue as to the answer...  The heavy-handed government bureaucrats, seizing the means of production and limiting the output of factories, are universally unlikeable (Rand would like this portrayal.) The special effects, particularly the flying scene, were definitely low budget. Though the film was probably fairly representative of the plot in Rand's book, I don't think the author would have been particularly pleased with this rendition.

[A quick Google search found the director's convoluted reason for the cast change, but I prefer to think that the actor from Part 1 asked for more money to be in Part 2 and were refused, which would be laughable for a film attempting to praise free market capitalism.] While terrible casting sometimes results in a movie that is unintentionally so bad it's good, this movie is not that kind of movie due to the low, very low, production values. Was that a model plane in the opening sequence? Are you kidding me? I got past that but was soon infuriated by a cameo by Fox News pundit Sean Hannity, whose intellectual qualifications barely surpass those of a bag of peanuts. I'm pretty sure Rand would vomit at the thought of Hannity in an Atlas Shrugged movie, especially when you consider it is people like Hannity who have hijacked Rand's message about capitalism while conveniently ignoring Rand's moral philosophy, to which Rand's vision of capitalism is married. (This was Part 1's greatest flaw as well.) Amusingly, fans of an unrestricted free market economy who say they have but never really did read Atlas Shrugged seem to think the acting and this movie in general is stellar, which is to say they think Linda Lovelace and Deep Throat should have won an Oscars. This movie is an abomination, but not inexplicably so if you consider that the director had no idea what the finer points of Rand's philosophies actually were. If you've never read Ayn Rand, stay away from this movie.

I found I liked the revamped cast better than the original (although Grant Bowler is always one of my personal favorites). I thought Samantha Mathis did a very good job as Dagney Taggart, owner of the railroad in dispute throughout most of this story. I went into Part 2 not having read any reviews and as I said, directly after watching Part 1. I don't know if that made a difference in my opinion or not, but I found The Strike to be quite exciting and the essence of Ayn Rand's point seemed to be made more openly than the subtleness of Part 1.I gave it 5 stars, something I don't do easily for movies (well, that's only partly true, I tend to only review the movies I like because I don't enjoy writing bad reviews - just me). I thought it moved along quickly, there was more involvement in the actual factories which was nice because we got to see the product, and basically how it's made and the employees involved in making it. In Part 2, the government seems to be winning this sort of war by using nefarious political strong arm tactics and by blackmailing the business people. I thought this had a very strong cast, and I thought the story was told a bit better as there were more visuals and explanations than in the first part. There is never any doubt, however, which side of this debate Ayn Rand stands on. She obviously saw the evils of Communism and wanted to write something people could relate to that would have an impact on a generation that seemed to be tuned out (the book was written, I think, in 1958). The only weak link, I thought, was the mysterious disappearance of the smartest and best creative thinkers, industrial owners, and artists by a darkly almost sinister figure named John Galt. I know the third movie of the series should settle it all out, if we get to see it, but the thread and threat of John Galt throughout the two movies could have been fleshed out a bit more, explained a bit clearer. There was also one discussion about John Galt and his mysterious Atlantis - a place where freedom reigns. Not having read the book, I'm at a disadvantage to compare it to the book, but in terms of strictly storyline, either leave it out altogether, except minor references, or give us more information. It seemed to be handled a bit clumsily in my opinion. But again, not having read the book, there could be a good reason for it and so it did not figure into my rating.I loved the ending, except now I have to wait until next summer (if they make the 3rd installment at all considering the negative reviews the 2nd installment got - which, to me, is possibly more scary than the story itself. Are people rating it because of their political persuasions, or because of the story? Just asking) for the finale. I bought both Part 1 and Part 2 here on Amazon, something I don't do a lot of these days because I thought it was just that good and worth owning. Keeping my fingers crossed for Part 3. Sure would like to see where these producers take the story. Otherwise, I'll have to read it. Yikes! It's 1,100 pages long! So, I loved both of these movies. I guess I just don't see all the negatives other people saw in the second movie. I would encourage you to rent it and think for yourself! After all, that's the very essence of Ayn Rand's writing. Don't just take things for granted and do what you're told. Think for yourself, be free, embrace free enterprise, because humanity hasn't grown as fast as their technology has grown. Wisdom, peace, understanding come with age and experience. I believe Ms. Rand wrote Atlas Shrugged to show just how far humans have to go before the responsibility of all of society's enterprises can be managed by one entity and that the capitalistic system has been set up with checks and balances needed to keep one group of humans from becoming all powerful. As they say, and it fits with the theme of this series of movies, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.",5,I Thought It Was Better Than Part 1,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,4117,"['watched', 'Part', '1', 'Part', '2', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'one', 'other', 'having', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'agree', 'Part', '2', 'repeat', 'Part', '1', 'slower', 'found', 'liked', 'revamped', 'cast', 'better', 'original', 'Grant', 'Bowler', 'always', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites', 'thought', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Dagney', 'Taggart', 'owner', 'railroad', 'dispute', 'most', 'story', 'went', 'Part', '2', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'reviews', 'said', 'directly', 'watching', 'Part', '1', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'made', 'difference', 'opinion', 'not', 'found', 'Strike', 'be', 'quite', 'exciting', 'essence', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'point', 'seemed', 'be', 'made', 'more', 'openly', 'subtleness', 'Part', '1.I', 'gave', '5', 'stars', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'easily', 'movies', 'well', 'only', 'partly', 'true', 'tend', 'only', 'review', 'movies', 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'writing', 'bad', 'reviews', 'just', 'thought', 'moved', 'along', 'quickly', 'was', 'more', 'involvement', 'actual', 'factories', 'was', 'nice', 'got', 'see', 'product', 'basically', 'how', 'made', 'employees', 'involved', 'making', 'Part', '2', 'government', 'be', 'winning', 'sort', 'war', 'using', 'nefarious', 'political', 'strong', 'arm', 'tactics', 'blackmailing', 'business', 'people', 'thought', 'had', 'very', 'strong', 'cast', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'bit', 'better', 'were', 'more', 'visuals', 'explanations', 'first', 'part', 'never', 'doubt', 'however', 'side', 'debate', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'obviously', 'saw', 'evils', 'Communism', 'wanted', 'write', 'something', 'people', 'could', 'relate', 'would', 'have', 'impact', 'generation', 'seemed', 'be', 'tuned', 'out', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'think', '1958', 'only', 'weak', 'link', 'thought', 'was', 'mysterious', 'disappearance', 'smartest', 'best', 'creative', 'thinkers', 'industrial', 'owners', 'artists', 'darkly', 'almost', 'sinister', 'figure', 'named', 'John', 'Galt', 'know', 'third', 'movie', 'series', 'should', 'settle', 'out', 'get', 'see', 'thread', 'threat', 'John', 'Galt', 'two', 'movies', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'bit', 'more', 'explained', 'bit', 'clearer', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'discussion', 'John', 'Galt', 'mysterious', 'Atlantis', 'place', 'where', 'freedom', 'reigns', 'Not', 'having', 'read', 'book', ""'m"", 'disadvantage', 'compare', 'book', 'terms', 'strictly', 'storyline', 'either', 'leave', 'out', 'altogether', 'minor', 'references', 'give', 'more', 'information', 'seemed', 'be', 'handled', 'bit', 'clumsily', 'opinion', 'again', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'figure', 'rating.I', 'loved', 'ending', 'now', 'have', 'wait', 'next', 'summer', 'make', '3rd', 'installment', 'considering', 'negative', '2nd', 'installment', 'got', 'possibly', 'more', 'scary', 'story', 'Are', 'people', 'rating', 'political', 'persuasions', 'story', 'Just', 'asking', 'finale', 'bought', 'Part', '1', 'Part', '2', 'here', 'Amazon', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'lot', 'days', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'that', 'good', 'worth', 'owning', 'Keeping', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'Part', '3', 'Sure', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'where', 'producers', 'take', 'story', 'Otherwise', ""'ll"", 'have', 'read', '1,100', 'pages', 'long', 'So', 'loved', 'movies', 'guess', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'negatives', 'other', 'people', 'saw', 'second', 'movie', 'would', 'encourage', 'rent', 'think', 'very', 'essence', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'writing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'just', 'take', 'things', 'granted', 'do', 'what', ""'re"", 'told', 'Think', 'be', 'free', 'embrace', 'free', 'enterprise', 'humanity', ""n't"", 'grown', 'as', 'fast', 'technology', 'grown', 'Wisdom', 'peace', 'understanding', 'come', 'age', 'experience', 'believe', 'Ms.', 'Rand', 'wrote', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'humans', 'have', 'go', 'responsibility', 'society', 'enterprises', 'can', 'be', 'managed', 'one', 'entity', 'capitalistic', 'system', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'checks', 'balances', 'needed', 'keep', 'one', 'group', 'humans', 'becoming', 'powerful', 'say', 'theme', 'series', 'movies', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolute', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolutely']",Atlas Shrugged II: The Strike

At the time (Eisenhower was in the White House, General Motors dominated the worldwide auto industry, and all was right with the world!) it seemed like an unbelievable dystopia. Now, some 56 years later, the book seems less like fiction and more like today's headlines!This 2012 movie, which was the sequel to Part I, takes the book, and updates it. The heroes of the story, Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden, navigate a world with cell phones and cable news, but the story stays true to the novel. It takes the story on to the terrible Taggart railroad disaster, and Dabny's discovery of the hidden valley.Overall, I found this to be a very good movie. With just a few tweaks, it really turns Atlas Shrugged into a story of today. You can see the sickening economy and governmental abuse unfolding, looking just like the similar stories you see every night on the news. Yes, it was too bad that the movie uses different stars from those in Part I, but that really did not ruin the movie for me.I really liked the novel Atlas Shrugged, and I really liked this movie.

1610955,A1JCWZU3WJB1AM,B00AIBZFDI,Moom,"[3, 9]","I think the only reasonable way to look at the Atlas Shrugged films is a science fiction film.  They take place on a planet that bears a superficial resemblance to the Earth, but is a very different place.  The society seems to be in the process of developing an economic system, but lacks a clear understanding of what motivates human behavior, and hence they are constantly debating how to structure the economics of their planet.At the start of the movie, the people of this world are experiencing a severe energy shortage.  No reason is given for why this shortage is taking place, and except for Dagny Taggart's work on a kind of magic energy machine, no steps are being taken to solve this crisis.  Curiously, the wealthy people who are the main characters in the film seem unaffected by the crisis.One problem with the film is that it does a poor job of relating how this imagined world relates to our contemporary society, which is what the best science fiction does.  A good example of this is when Dagny Taggart meets with her company's board of directors, where they decide to close the John Galt line.  This is presented as the board somehow getting in the way of Dagny Taggart's leadership, but doesn't all that depend on the way in which the company is structured?  If the Taggart railroad is a publicly traded company, the board has a legal responsibility to run the company of behalf of the shareholders.  Dagny Taggart would serve at the pleasure of the board of directors.  If it is a privately held company (and given the way it is named after the family, this seems possible), whoever has a controlling share of stock can make decisions of the company.  This is basic capitalism.  Instead, decisions seem to be made mostly to make Dagny sad.It's unfortunate that the nature of the economic emergency is never made clear.  During WWII, national economic policies resembled those enacted during the film to some degree, but the WWII was a true national emergency that required the mobilization of the national economy.  Governments have taken much more limited steps to deal with the recessions of the past few years, and while they have not brought about a complete recovery, they have prevented recessions from turning into something far worse.It's interesting to contemplate a film that would allow for more imaginative debate on the role of economic systems in building a healthy society.

Over the past two years, Wesley Mouch, recovering from cancer I suppose, dropped 40 lbs, lost his hair and grew a wispy goatee. James Taggart and Eddie Willers started shooting steroids and both tripled in size. And Rearden Metal was taken over by Sonny Corleone. For Dagny Taggart it was all too much. She aged 20 years in two.If you enjoyed part 1 of Atlas Shrugged (the movie) you'll be amazed by part 2. These producers were not able to retain a single actor. The really odd thing is they made no effort to find actors who looked remotely like the original cast. I know they produced this on the fly, but frankly from a viewer's perspective, it might have been better if they simply hadn't done the project at all. It is completely disconcerting when you meet the new Dagny and can only recognize her because she's wearing the Rearden Metal bracelet. Ironically in a film based on a book about extremely competent people in a world falling apart, the feeling you get is that this production team is inept and incompetent.The production values are still high. Camera work is good. The direction, however, is much more heavy-handed than it was in part 1. While the actors are capable they can't get around the more aggressive script and their completely different interpretations of the characters from the part 1 cast.I suppose the cast for part 3 will be geriatric and I doubt I'll be there to witness it. I wanted to see this at the movies when it was released and now I'm glad I was too busy.

It is a great work, but it is only one third of what probably will be a three-part-three video set.  The non-existent (yet) third section is where Rand's message comes together.  Until then, neither of the first two parts comes together in a truly comprehensible manner.  But it was a good try.One last comment:  Changing the characters from segment to segment is very distracting.  The actors chosen do good jobs, and though the parts still make up only two-thirds of an important whole, their work is astonishingly close to the characters in the book.  The trougle is that, while the Fountainhead stands on its own, and the apologetic is finally crystallized in Roark's speech to the court.  In that film, I was never sure that Cooper or the others really understood the vital message they were acting to, but it came across pretty well.

1610995,A2TOXBTDH3Y6R9,B00AIBZFDI,Rich H.,"[0, 1]","Being the second of three parts of the long-awaited cinematic adaptation of Ayn Rand's masterwork.  Railroad executive Dagny Taggart and steel magnate Hank Rearden struggle to keep their companies and their freedom in the face of a tidal wave of government oppression in the name of ""the people.""  As in Part I, a shadowy figure known only as ""the Destroyer"" seems to be persuading their industrial and cultural peers to vanish one by one, taking their wealth with them or destroying it in spectacularly public fashion. With the nation's economy and society collapsing around her, Taggart, in hot pursuit of the inventor of a breakthrough energy generator, makes an astonishing discovery deep in the Rocky Mountains.The director and entire cast of Part I have been replaced for this installment, the budget has increased a little, the FX are improved, and all these changes seem to have been for the better.  Samantha Mathis and Jason Beghe make a more believable and less wooden Dagny and Hank than were their Part I counterparts.  There's more and better action this time around, the soundtrack has been punched up a little, and once again the sets and FX look like they belong in a movie with two or three times the budget.  All in all, with one exception, this film is a distinct improvement over Part I.That exception, unfortunately, is a serious one.  Atlas Shrugged is a story with a message, one which emerges in full force in part 2 of the novel.  In the movie, however, the meat of this message seems to have gotten lost among the cocktail parties and train wrecks and sign-waving demonstrations and jet plane chases.  We learn a lot about *what* is happening to the country as it nears total collapse, but we learn little about  *why* it is happening.  The problem is that in this story the ""why"" is far more important.The most glaring example: In the book, while en route to Colorado (by rail, of course,) Dagny encounters a stowaway tramp who turns out to be a former employee of the now-defunct Twentieth Century Motor Company, the factory where Dagny and Hank discovered the prototype energy generator.  She befriends him, and he tells her at length about the failure of the company after being turned into a Marxist collective by its new owners.  This is, perhaps, the most powerful chapter in the entire novel: a chilling, dramatic, entirely too believable tale of souls being crushed en masse in the name of ""the common good;"" a once-proud company falling to ruin as its workers find that the New Order rewards political maneuvering and backstabbing over ability and integrity.  It finally, fully reveals just what the Makers are up against, and it is ugly.This tale easily warranted ten or fifteen minutes of screen time.  Instead, we got a 90-second monologue from a track worker beside a stalled train; yeah, these people took over the company and it was bad, and the guy that invented the generator said he'd stop the motor of the world, blah blah, let's wrap it up because Dagny has a date to wreck a Learjet in a few minutes.  I realize that some severe condensation of Rand's story was necessary to avoid a 36-hour run time, but the glossing over of this and a few other powerful moments (""Who are you?"" ""I. AM. JOHN. GALT!"" - way to hit us over the head with it, people) is very disappointing.Bottom line: Atlas Shrugged II is watchable; it's a definite improvement over Part I, and will impress those unfamiliar with the novel a lot more than Part I did.  For those who have read the book, however, it's something of a letdown.  I'll watch Part III when it's released, but the cautious optimism I expressed in my review of Part I is pretty much gone.  Three stars, and we'll see this fall whether Part III can drive the story's point home in a way that this installment did not.",3,"Better than part I, but falls short of its potential",1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,3805,"['Being', 'second', 'three', 'parts', 'long-awaited', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'Ayn', 'Rand', 'masterwork', 'Railroad', 'executive', 'Dagny', 'Taggart', 'steel', 'magnate', 'Hank', 'Rearden', 'struggle', 'keep', 'companies', 'freedom', 'face', 'tidal', 'wave', 'government', 'oppression', 'name', 'people', 'Part', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'known', 'only', 'Destroyer', 'be', 'persuading', 'industrial', 'cultural', 'peers', 'vanish', 'one', 'one', 'taking', 'wealth', 'destroying', 'spectacularly', 'public', 'fashion', 'nation', 'economy', 'society', 'collapsing', 'Taggart', 'hot', 'pursuit', 'inventor', 'breakthrough', 'energy', 'generator', 'astonishing', 'discovery', 'deep', 'Rocky', 'Mountains.The', 'director', 'entire', 'cast', 'Part', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'installment', 'budget', 'increased', 'little', 'FX', 'are', 'improved', 'changes', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'Jason', 'Beghe', 'make', 'more', 'believable', 'less', 'wooden', 'Dagny', 'Hank', 'were', 'Part', 'counterparts', 'more', 'better', 'action', 'time', 'around', 'soundtrack', 'been', 'punched', 'up', 'little', 'once', 'again', 'sets', 'FX', 'look', 'belong', 'movie', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'budget', 'one', 'exception', 'film', 'distinct', 'improvement', 'Part', 'I.That', 'exception', 'unfortunately', 'serious', 'one', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'story', 'message', 'one', 'full', 'force', 'part', '2', 'novel', 'movie', 'however', 'meat', 'message', 'have', 'gotten', 'lost', 'cocktail', 'parties', 'train', 'wrecks', 'sign-waving', 'demonstrations', 'jet', 'plane', 'chases', 'learn', 'lot', '*what*', 'happening', 'country', 'total', 'collapse', 'learn', 'little', '*why*', 'happening', 'problem', 'story', 'why', 'far', 'more', 'important.The', 'most', 'glaring', 'example', 'book', 'en', 'route', 'Colorado', 'rail', 'course', 'Dagny', 'stowaway', 'tramp', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'former', 'employee', 'now-defunct', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Motor', 'Company', 'factory', 'where', 'Dagny', 'Hank', 'discovered', 'prototype', 'energy', 'generator', 'length', 'failure', 'company', 'being', 'turned', 'Marxist', 'collective', 'new', 'owners', 'perhaps', 'most', 'powerful', 'chapter', 'entire', 'novel', 'chilling', 'dramatic', 'entirely', 'too', 'believable', 'tale', 'souls', 'being', 'crushed', 'en', 'masse', 'name', 'common', 'good', 'once-proud', 'company', 'falling', 'ruin', 'workers', 'find', 'New', 'Order', 'rewards', 'political', 'maneuvering', 'backstabbing', 'ability', 'integrity', 'finally', 'fully', 'just', 'what', 'Makers', 'are', 'up', 'ugly.This', 'tale', 'easily', 'warranted', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'Instead', 'got', '90-second', 'monologue', 'track', 'worker', 'stalled', 'train', 'people', 'took', 'over', 'company', 'was', 'bad', 'guy', 'invented', 'generator', 'said', ""'d"", 'stop', 'motor', 'world', 'blah', 'blah', 'let', 'wrap', 'up', 'Dagny', 'date', 'wreck', 'Learjet', 'few', 'minutes', 'realize', 'severe', 'condensation', 'Rand', 'story', 'was', 'necessary', 'avoid', '36-hour', 'run', 'time', 'glossing', 'few', 'other', 'powerful', 'moments', 'Who', 'are', 'AM', 'JOHN', 'GALT', 'way', 'hit', 'head', 'people', 'very', 'disappointing.Bottom', 'line', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', 'II', 'watchable', 'definite', 'improvement', 'Part', 'will', 'impress', 'unfamiliar', 'novel', 'lot', 'more', 'Part', 'did', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'however', 'something', 'letdown', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'Part', 'III', 'when', 'released', 'cautious', 'optimism', 'expressed', 'review', 'Part', 'pretty', 'much', 'gone', 'Three', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'see', 'fall', 'Part', 'III', 'can', 'drive', 'story', 'point', 'home', 'way', 'installment', 'did', 'not']",Atlas Shrugged II: The Strike

But this movie had amateurish graphics and poor research on the central industries, the railroad, whereas the steel factory seemed mostly accurate, with very good CG.Seems that Hollywood doesn't have knowledgeable people to go to when creating trains or realistic railroad scenarios. There were more than  three major technical errors, besides the impossible jet plane maneuvers in the chase sequence. I've only seem two movies with accurate portrayals of trains in the last decade: &#34;The Lone Ranger,&#34; where the original locomotives are accurately replicated, and &#34;Unstoppable&#34; where appropriate contemporary trains were actually used. Most movie producers use the local train museums for their trains.First, railroads don't have grades of 15-percent. No locomotive could go up that steep a grade, much less pulling a train. (Maybe a tourist cog loco up mountain.)Second, a steam locomotive takes hours to get steamed up before operating, that's why in the big industrial junctions, an apprentice was assigned to keep the locomotives steamed for the next day's runs. He was also responsible that the pressure on his locomotives didn't get too high, and explode.Third, a single steam locomotive of the type shown wouldn't have enough drawbar power to pull that many passenger cars on level track, much less in Colorado mountain lines.Finally, in one scene a boxcar roof with ice hatches rolls down the video. Maybe a 1925 museum piece.I gave it a second star for the actors portraying impossible characters. This film reminded me of student films that I've seen, created by beginning  college film students.I read &#34;Atlas Shrugged&#34; years ago, and neither this part nor part one seemed an accurate portrayal..",2,Ruined by too many technical errors.,1401926400,"06 5, 2014",2014,1770,"['sound', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'filming', 'movie', 'had', 'amateurish', 'graphics', 'poor', 'research', 'central', 'industries', 'railroad', 'steel', 'factory', 'seemed', 'mostly', 'accurate', 'very', 'good', 'CG.Seems', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'have', 'knowledgeable', 'people', 'go', 'when', 'creating', 'trains', 'realistic', 'railroad', 'scenarios', 'were', 'more', 'three', 'major', 'technical', 'errors', 'impossible', 'jet', 'plane', 'maneuvers', 'chase', 'sequence', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seem', 'two', 'movies', 'accurate', 'portrayals', 'trains', 'last', 'decade', '34', 'Lone', 'Ranger', '34', 'where', 'original', 'locomotives', 'are', 'accurately', 'replicated', '34', 'Unstoppable', '34', 'where', 'appropriate', 'contemporary', 'trains', 'were', 'actually', 'used', 'Most', 'movie', 'producers', 'use', 'local', 'train', 'museums', 'trains.First', 'railroads', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'grades', '15-percent', 'locomotive', 'could', 'go', 'up', 'grade', 'much', 'less', 'pulling', 'train', 'Maybe', 'tourist', 'cog', 'up', 'mountain', 'Second', 'steam', 'locomotive', 'hours', 'get', 'steamed', 'up', 'operating', 'why', 'big', 'industrial', 'junctions', 'apprentice', 'was', 'assigned', 'keep', 'locomotives', 'steamed', 'next', 'day', 'runs', 'was', 'also', 'responsible', 'pressure', 'locomotives', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'high', 'explode.Third', 'single', 'steam', 'locomotive', 'type', 'shown', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'drawbar', 'power', 'pull', 'many', 'passenger', 'cars', 'level', 'track', 'much', 'less', 'Colorado', 'mountain', 'lines.Finally', 'one', 'scene', 'boxcar', 'roof', 'ice', 'hatches', 'rolls', 'down', 'video', 'Maybe', '1925', 'museum', 'piece.I', 'gave', 'second', 'star', 'actors', 'portraying', 'impossible', 'characters', 'film', 'reminded', 'student', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'created', 'beginning', 'college', 'film', 'students.I', 'read', '34', 'Atlas', 'Shrugged', '34', 'years', 'ago', 'neither', 'part', 'part', 'one', 'seemed', 'accurate', 'portrayal..']",Atlas Shrugged II: The Strike

1611024,A1RVBEAD8RKDT8,B00AIBZFDI,SpirituallySpeaking,"[2, 3]","I was happy to see Atlas Shrugged get a deserved Part II.  The message in Part II comes through even stronger in this film, even moreso than the first.  The book by Ayn Rand is so immense, that I think it would have been better served as a 10-part miniseries.  There's SO much information and the plot is so dense, that even spanning it over three 2-hour films feels rushed.  Relationships and plot elements ""just happen"" because the story has to keep moving.  There's so much ground to cover.Aside from that fact, the acting is well done.  I know there were major cast changes to the principle roles from Part I, particularly Dagney and Reardon.  I didn't think those changes added anything to the film.  I really enjoyed both actors from the first film.  While Samantha Mathis also does a great job here as the new Dagney, Michael Biehen as Reardon (who I've loved in other things) just seems too worn out and tired of a guy to take on the world in this epic battle.  He's also significantly older than the previous actor, who I really missed.Production values are overall, pretty good.  I'd heard they raised the budget for this installment and that the effects were much better than Part I.  I didn't see any real problem with the Part I effects.  Having said that, there are moments in this film, where the CGI is SO bad, it's cringe-worthy.  Most of the wide, geographical vistas look completely phoney and the plane crash sqeuence that opens and closes the film looks so fake, it seems like a video game image.  I'm stunned than anyone would accept that in the final cut.  The film ""Alive"" did one of the most famous plane crash sequences ever put to film with NO CGI and that was over 20 years ago.  Why didn't the director take a ""less is more"" approach when handling that scene?The best part about this film is its message and it's even more central in this installment.  Reardon, during his congressional indictment hearing, Francisco and a few others have great monologues that make profound statements.  I'm giving this film 5 stars for its timeliness and courage to put forth a message that a sleepwalking American public needs to hear at the 11th hour, with its best days seemingly behind it.It's the oldest trick in the book.  Whenever anyone wants to control another person or group of people, you have to make them AFRAID first.  Fear is the real weapon.  Once you make them afraid, you simply propose a solution that will ""protect"" them from that big, scary problem (and serve YOUR interests at the same time).  It's the easiest way to get people to agree to things they would NEVER logically consent to outright.I'm NOT a conservative, Republican or even a Democrat.  One need only look at America's history over the last 100 years and you can easily see the ""problem-reaction-solution"" game that's been played by self-serving government powerbrokers to further their own interests, whittle away freedoms and make the citizenry even more subordinate to them.  No matter where you stand on the issues, it's VERY clear that more government involvment in anything is NEVER a good thing.  The US government was originally intended to be VERY, VERY small, with only 39 specific duties delegated to it.  Whether it's gun control, government sponsored ""free"" healthcare or anything else; the result is always the same.  In return for ""protection"", you get more regulation and less freedom.  Americans need to wake up.

Part 2 does better than Part 1 as we now see the cell phones and computers in abundance. However, alternative energy seems nonexistent. Indeed with gas at $40.00 a gallon, Volts and Prius would be everywhere. Since plastic comes from petroleum, the use of plastic as a coffee cup lid would have ceased. But the film was made to show us that when all the world's best and brightest are taken away, Sean Hannity would be left behind and no one can fill the void of those wonderful job creators.No matter which side of the political spectrum you are on the film agrees with both: The poor couldn't exist without the rich. Henry Rearden (Jason Beghe) is quite the despicable character to be the hero of libertarian capitalism. He makes amateur speeches similar to those made by tax protesters I knew in the 1980s...the ones who ended up in jail. His message is simple: Government is evil. Taxes are robbery. Tax money given to help everyone but himself, goes to looters. In this film capitalism has gotten so out of control, they force the hand of government to nationalize all business and created a sudden communistic society by executive order. Can't happen, but try to go with it.There is a gross exaggeration of the battle between capitalism and socialism, as if the two can not coexist in one society, except it does exist that way in every society to one degree or another. However, they don't exist exclusively without each other. You hear the mantra of the barter system ""True value for value."" Hand me my barf bag.The main problem I had with the film was not the exaggerated if not cartoonish view it took on economics, but the stiff cardboard characters who can't act.

The cast improved over the first installment (my opinion), but neither even approximated what Rand was trying to convey. For instance, Francisco's &#34;Money is the Root of All Evil?&#34; speech (sililoquy) is one of the most important events in the book (along with Galt's speech over the radio nearer the end of the book). In the MOVEIE, the &#34;money speech&#34; gets a few offhand lines. It is condensed and edited to the point of meaningless drivel. That's just ONE specific example.I am not a &#34;Randian,&#34; but I AM a big fan who has read almost everything she wrote.

If you can, go backand rewatch the first one and you'll see what I mean.What is entertainment if not partly visual? The message of the movie translated from the book comes across in its purity and was not sacrificed. The second installment, or part 2 of Atlas Shrugged movies' message continuity feels disjointed and the chemistry between actors, with the exception of Rearden and D'Acostonia; the sets and props which gave the first movie impact and vibrancy w/a stylized throw back vintage feel along with the sweeping shots of desert/valley scenes in the first were majorly lacking in the second.The first movie had at the time, mostly unknown actors which at first makes one think - 'shoestring' but the acting was VERY strong and good and having watched the movie a second time, I appreciate it twice as much now. The characters appeared much more interesting...there was an intensity in the acting and quite frankly the lead characters a lot more attractive.Putting completely new actors in the latest installment - all of which appear at least 10 to 15 years older was a bad move. Samantha Mathis does her job well as does Esai Morales but for me they were both a distraction. I'm a fan of Jason Beghe and given his characters dilemma I think he added the most continuity structure wise. Also, two different actresses play his wifes' role and boy, they couldn't have been any different looking. The 2nd actress was a good choice and appeared much more modern/attractive than the first actress playing the character. But the first actress made me loathe her more so having 2 VERY different actresses kept me seeing the disparity which again - was a back of the mind kind of distraction.I appreciate that there will be a part 3 and I just as soon see other actors in these roles or would hope they would bring back the originals. The actor who portrayed the character ""Mauch"" (sp?) for eg was heavier set and conveyed the business of politics and cronyism much stronger than the actor in the 2nd movie.Part 2 is still a good movie with an intact message and in that regard, still worth seeing. Best scene: guys in the operations center trying to route the train and the tracks just before catastrophe strikes.
