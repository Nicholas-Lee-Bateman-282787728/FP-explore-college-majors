1053297,A3MLG7U2B69TOP,B000N3TWRG,Bollywhat?,"[1, 1]","Vivah is a great movie, but its different from typical Bollywood cinema. Today most films that are about love conquering all scorn the subject of arranged marriages, and in most the lovers are trying to avoid them (like in DDLJ or Jab We Met). That is not the plot of Vivah. The film is a kind of argument for arranged marriage, or what arranged marriages should be like: they should be carefully considered, the two people should be a good match and given time to get to know one another before the wedding, and it should not be about money. The story is the poster child for this more conservative look on love (Also see Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam for another film with a more conservative look on marriage and love).That said, Vivah is a great film. The acting is well done, especially the leads, the family dynamics are interesting, and while the music isn't the most flashy I've seen, it is enjoyable. The story is about Prem and Pooman, who are each from conservative Hindi families who want to see them married and happy. Prem's family is upper class and owns a big business; Poonam is an orphan who grew up living with her uncle's middle class family, helping with the small family business and never quite being excepted by her aunt. They meet and agree to marry, and in the months grow to love each other, while dealing with wedding drama and an unexpected accident. In the end it's a film to watch if you've had a bad day, are in the mood for a fluffy sweet story, or need a good dose of ""the world isn't as bad a we think it is.""I gave this four stars when it deserves five because of the film quality. It is not the two disc version that many have reviewed, so if you think that's what your getting, read the info again. It is an all regions, Hindi language, English subtitle version. It doesn't have a menu, and you select scenes using your remote. The picture isn't the best, more like your watching a Hindi movie made in the late 80s or early 90s as apposed to the quality of today's films. It takes a minute or two to get used to it, so be warned it won't look the best on a big screen (our TV is a 44in flat screen and it still looked ok and i was able to enjoy the film without any complaints). This is apparently because its not anamorphic or some technical term like that, basically its the on demand version. If you want extras and great quality, buy the original off another vender. If you just want the movie and are not picky (or just used to the quality of older films that get transferred to DVD) this is a good option.",4,"Great Film, not the best DVD",1306195200,"05 24, 2011",2011,2542,"['Vivah', 'great', 'movie', 'different', 'typical', 'Bollywood', 'cinema', 'Today', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'conquering', 'scorn', 'subject', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'most', 'lovers', 'are', 'trying', 'avoid', 'DDLJ', 'Jab', 'Met', 'not', 'plot', 'Vivah', 'film', 'kind', 'argument', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'what', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'should', 'be', 'should', 'be', 'carefully', 'considered', 'two', 'people', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'match', 'given', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'wedding', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'money', 'story', 'poster', 'child', 'more', 'conservative', 'look', 'love', 'Also', 'see', 'Hum', 'Dil', 'De', 'Chuke', 'Sanam', 'film', 'more', 'conservative', 'look', 'marriage', 'love', 'said', 'Vivah', 'great', 'film', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'leads', 'family', 'dynamics', 'are', 'interesting', 'music', ""n't"", 'most', 'flashy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'Prem', 'Pooman', 'who', 'are', 'conservative', 'Hindi', 'families', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'married', 'happy', 'Prem', 'family', 'upper', 'class', 'big', 'business', 'Poonam', 'orphan', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'living', 'uncle', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'helping', 'small', 'family', 'business', 'never', 'quite', 'being', 'excepted', 'aunt', 'meet', 'agree', 'marry', 'months', 'grow', 'love', 'other', 'dealing', 'wedding', 'drama', 'unexpected', 'accident', 'end', 'film', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'had', 'bad', 'day', 'are', 'mood', 'fluffy', 'sweet', 'story', 'need', 'good', 'dose', 'world', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'think', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'when', 'five', 'film', 'quality', 'not', 'two', 'disc', 'version', 'many', 'have', 'reviewed', 'so', 'think', 'what', 'getting', 'read', 'info', 'again', 'regions', 'Hindi', 'language', 'English', 'version', ""n't"", 'have', 'menu', 'select', 'scenes', 'using', 'remote', 'picture', ""n't"", 'best', 'more', 'watching', 'Hindi', 'movie', 'made', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'apposed', 'quality', 'today', 'films', 'minute', 'two', 'get', 'used', 'so', 'be', 'warned', 'wo', ""n't"", 'look', 'best', 'big', 'screen', 'TV', '44in', 'flat', 'screen', 'still', 'looked', 'ok', 'i', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'film', 'complaints', 'apparently', 'not', 'anamorphic', 'technical', 'term', 'basically', 'demand', 'version', 'want', 'extras', 'great', 'quality', 'buy', 'original', 'off', 'vender', 'just', 'want', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'picky', 'just', 'used', 'quality', 'older', 'films', 'get', 'transferred', 'DVD', 'good', 'option']",Vivah
1053298,A26A3IVR1CQKFV,B000N3TWRG,Constance Thomas,"[0, 0]","This is not your typical Bollywood romance movie. it is a romance, and it does have Shahid's excellent and endearing acting and personality as always, but it's totally different. It's not set in modern tones at all. All of the acting and songs are very traditional, and calm. it's a quiet movie. There are no over the top song and dance numbers. All the songs were sung by the two leads themselves with very little instrumental backup. To me it almost felt dated in the way that the cinematography was. What makes the movie truly entertaining is the personalities of all the family members, as another reviewer said. Each family member has a distinct, and funny personality that keeps you laughing throughout the film. It's really more about all their lives, and how they are effected when a wedding takes place in each family with the bride and the groom. My husband and I watched this together, and he loved it. He appreciated seeing an Indian movie without over the top song and dance. It was also very interesting seeing all the traditions that they have. I have to say though that I didn't cry at the end. Maybe it's because I felt through the entire movie you could feel Shahid's performance, and that he was in love with the girl, but I didn't feel hers. It was probably just because of the way the story goes with her being a very traditional girl, with traditional values, and not showing her feelings over much. However, because of that I didn't cry at the end, because I didn't feel connected to her at all. It felt very much like a one sided romance. Shahid's character keeps it going through the entire movie, and his character is also the one to hold them up through bad times at the end. I just felt that of the two, his romantic performance outshone hers by a lot. And in case you are wondering what the big tragedy is at the end? It's a fire. That's all I'm going to say on that. You will have to watch and decide for yourselves if this movie suits you or not. I much prefer to see an over the top silly and loud Bollywood musical.",4,"Quiet, and Calm",1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,2048,"['not', 'typical', 'Bollywood', 'romance', 'movie', 'romance', 'have', 'Shahid', 'excellent', 'endearing', 'acting', 'personality', 'always', 'totally', 'different', 'not', 'set', 'modern', 'tones', 'acting', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'traditional', 'calm', 'quiet', 'movie', 'are', 'top', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'songs', 'were', 'sung', 'two', 'very', 'little', 'instrumental', 'backup', 'almost', 'felt', 'dated', 'way', 'cinematography', 'was', 'What', 'movie', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'personalities', 'family', 'members', 'reviewer', 'said', 'family', 'member', 'distinct', 'funny', 'personality', 'laughing', 'film', 'really', 'more', 'lives', 'how', 'are', 'effected', 'when', 'wedding', 'place', 'family', 'bride', 'groom', 'husband', 'watched', 'together', 'loved', 'appreciated', 'seeing', 'Indian', 'movie', 'top', 'song', 'dance', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'traditions', 'have', 'have', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'cry', 'end', 'felt', 'entire', 'movie', 'could', 'feel', 'Shahid', 'performance', 'was', 'love', 'girl', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'hers', 'was', 'probably', 'just', 'way', 'story', 'being', 'very', 'traditional', 'girl', 'traditional', 'values', 'not', 'showing', 'feelings', 'much', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'cry', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'connected', 'felt', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'sided', 'romance', 'Shahid', 'character', 'going', 'entire', 'movie', 'character', 'also', 'one', 'hold', 'up', 'bad', 'times', 'end', 'just', 'felt', 'two', 'romantic', 'performance', 'outshone', 'hers', 'lot', 'case', 'are', 'wondering', 'what', 'big', 'tragedy', 'end', 'fire', ""'m"", 'going', 'say', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'decide', 'yourselves', 'movie', 'suits', 'not', 'much', 'prefer', 'see', 'top', 'silly', 'loud', 'Bollywood', 'musical']",Vivah

Having grown up as a typical California girl, therefore, many things in this movie made me raise my elegant blonde eyebrows extremely high, while some subtle Indian cultural references (such as dark skin being considered ugly, or a bride with scars on her body being considered such damaged goods that the bridegroom attains sainthood if he stays with her) were things I missed entirely until I read other reviews.I am not sure whether to say I liked or did not like the movie. For me, it seemed terribly slow, and also I never in my life saw the tops of a woman's eyelids so much as I did the demure Poonam's, because she kept her eyes so consistently lowered throughout the movie that I began to imagine at least 16 hours a day were spent in gazing at the tops of her shoes. However, the love story was well done enough to bring tears to my eyes several times.Things that shocked and surprised me most as a Westerner had nothing to do with the arranged aspect of the marriage - after all, the two young people both were permitted to say &#34;no&#34;, although they didn't. I was shocked, however, by what I think was probably the portrayal of an &#34;ideal bride&#34;, someone who is far too shy and demure to raise their eyes or speak, even when her fiancee is trying very hard to try to get to know her.Things that caused surprise:- the references to &#34;chaste Hindi&#34; as a language or a dialect - I will have to look it up to understand what it is- in conversation, the words &#34;trust, honesty&#34; were spoken in English, why? There are surely comparable words in Hindi?- other words and clearly American phrases that seemed blended in (&#34;Watch out for this guy!&#34;, etc.) with the native language- Poonam's ideal womanliness is further established by her uncle's praise: &#34;She always anticipates everything I could need&#34;, to an American this sounds like the perfect wife is a perfect servant- another commenter referred to Poonam as &#34;disfigured&#34; by the end of the movie, but she was still extremely beautiful, without a mark on her face. Is she really considered disfigured (and unmarriageable by normal standards) in Indian culture?Anyway, it was very interesting although I did think it slow, and I did like the story. I believe Indian traditional dress is far more beautiful and feminine than the overly-revealing and not particularly colorful or lovely things we Americans have to wear, for sure.",3,Interesting glimpse into traditional Indian values,1402444800,"06 11, 2014",2014,2520,"[""'m"", 'caucasian', 'European', 'descent', 'know', 'next', 'nothing', 'Indian', 'culture', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'typical', 'California', 'girl', 'therefore', 'many', 'things', 'movie', 'made', 'raise', 'elegant', 'blonde', 'extremely', 'high', 'subtle', 'Indian', 'cultural', 'references', 'such', 'dark', 'skin', 'being', 'considered', 'ugly', 'bride', 'scars', 'body', 'being', 'considered', 'such', 'damaged', 'goods', 'bridegroom', 'sainthood', 'were', 'things', 'missed', 'entirely', 'read', 'other', 'reviews.I', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'say', 'liked', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'seemed', 'terribly', 'slow', 'also', 'never', 'life', 'saw', 'tops', 'woman', 'eyelids', 'so', 'much', 'did', 'demure', 'Poonam', 'kept', 'eyes', 'so', 'consistently', 'lowered', 'movie', 'began', 'imagine', 'least', '16', 'hours', 'day', 'were', 'spent', 'gazing', 'tops', 'shoes', 'However', 'love', 'story', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'enough', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'several', 'times.Things', 'shocked', 'surprised', 'most', 'Westerner', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'arranged', 'aspect', 'marriage', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'were', 'permitted', 'say', '34', '34', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'shocked', 'however', 'what', 'think', 'was', 'probably', 'portrayal', '34', 'ideal', '34', 'someone', 'who', 'far', 'too', 'shy', 'demure', 'raise', 'eyes', 'speak', 'even', 'when', 'fiancee', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'try', 'get', 'know', 'her.Things', 'caused', 'surprise', 'references', '34', 'chaste', 'Hindi', '34', 'language', 'dialect', 'will', 'have', 'look', 'up', 'understand', 'what', 'is-', 'conversation', 'words', '34', 'trust', 'honesty', '34', 'were', 'spoken', 'English', 'why', 'are', 'surely', 'comparable', 'words', 'Hindi', 'other', 'words', 'clearly', 'American', 'phrases', 'seemed', 'blended', '34', 'Watch', 'guy', '34', 'etc', 'native', 'language-', 'Poonam', 'ideal', 'womanliness', 'further', 'established', 'uncle', 'praise', '34', 'always', 'everything', 'could', 'need', '34', 'American', 'perfect', 'wife', 'perfect', 'servant-', 'commenter', 'referred', 'Poonam', '34', 'disfigured', '34', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'mark', 'face', 'really', 'considered', 'disfigured', 'unmarriageable', 'normal', 'standards', 'Indian', 'culture', 'Anyway', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'did', 'think', 'slow', 'did', 'story', 'believe', 'Indian', 'traditional', 'dress', 'far', 'more', 'beautiful', 'feminine', 'overly-revealing', 'not', 'particularly', 'colorful', 'lovely', 'things', 'Americans', 'have', 'wear', 'sure']",Vivah

This movie is VIVAH, and it unabashedly hearkens back to India's more traditional conventions, and specifically that of the arranged marriage. Released in 2006 VIVAH tells the story of two young people, Prem and Poonam, strangers to one another yet destined to be wedded. So it'd be nice if they like each other.Poonam (Amrita Rao) is an orphaned girl from the small town of Madhupur, who was raised in her uncle's household. She is beautiful and demure and brought up to be obedient and traditional. Despite this, her aunt dislikes her intensely, simply because Poonam is far prettier than her own daughter, never mind that Poonam and her daughter get along very well. Poonam has tried to make the best of it, basking in the love lavished on her by her doting uncle and cousin. But, all her life, she's longed for a mother's affection...Prem (Shahid Kapoor) is the youngest son of an industrial magnate in Delhi. Carefree and just about to settle into his career, Prem is very surprised and unprepared when his father proposes an arranged marriage for him. Yet Prem is respectful enough to at least meet his potential bride, an act which proves fatal to his bachelorhood. Instantly charmed by Poonam, Prem promptly gives the nod to the marriage contract. As for Poonam, it's hard to tell what she's really thinking because she's so damned demure, but she seems to reciprocate Prem's interest. So the contract is finalized, friendships are struck, a romance is fostered, and the nuptials set to take place in six months' time.As the following weeks and months elapse and the families get better acquainted, Poonam and Prem continue to get ever closer, until that old familiar happens: Poonam and Prem fall in love. And, suddenly, the big day can't come soon enough. But complications surface. Poonam's aunt still bears her a deep jealous resentment and, so, what should have been an idyllic time for Poonam is sabotaged by her aunt's venomous snipings at her uncle, over his extravagant financing of the wedding and over his seeming disregard for his own daughter's future prospects. Then, on the eve of the wedding, a life-threatening tragedy unfolds, and Poonam and Prem and their families will be tested as never before.Even in Bollywood cinema, the idea of the arranged marriage has taken its share of negative hits. So, every once in a while, for balance's sake, it's nice to see a film which espouses the positives of this age-old institution. I don't necessarily agree with it as I'm more with the free choice side of the fence. But it's nice to hear from the other point of view. And, more importantly, while not a classic, I do think VIVAH is a movie worth watching. It certainly did well enough at India's box office.Granted, not much of a plot here in VIVAH. Basically, the film is built on simple moments as it tracks the progression of the arranged marriage, from the contractual conception to the courtship to the consummation of the marriage ceremony. Nothing gossip-worthy happens, and, other than the virulent aunt, all is easy-peasy until the last thirty minutes when the tragic twist surfaces. Sadly, the musical interludes are lackluster. And the sedate pacing and lack of narrative punch might've turned me off, except that the superb cast managed to keep me involved. These characters are likable enough (except for the aunt) that you even get immersed in the slow scenes. VIVAH applies a huge chunk of the running time in developing Poonam and Prem's blossoming relationship, as they overcome their mutual shyness and awkwardness and begin to fall for each other. Theirs isn't a raging romance. Their subdued personalities don't lend too much to fiery, over-the-top demonstrations, although there is a moment when Prem shouts ""I love you!"" in an airport. Rather, theirs is a connection arrived at by achieving a certain mutual comfort level and by clinging to a commitment to and a respect for traditional culture and customs. But, also, that they're both very attractive people probably didn't hurt any.Again, the glue of VIVAH is the cast. The two young leads, Shahid Kapoor and the ravishing Amrita Rao, turn in sensitive, if bland, performances. The supporting actors turn out to be as equally important. Particularly great are Anupam Kher and Alok Nath, who respectively play Prem's wealthy but grounded father and Poonam's loving uncle and surrogate father. And the fact that you end up hating on Poonam's dour-faced aunt is, of course, a reflection of Seema Biswas's very good acting skills.For those with the 2-dvd set, the first disc has the film and song selections. The second disc contains the 19-minute-long ""Making of the Film"" featurette (average) and the 21-minute-long ""Making of the Music"" (dull).Graced with a gentle, low key charm and a heartwarming simplicity, the waterworks really come on in the tense and emotional last half hour (Grab your hanky). And yet VIVAH may prove to be too Pollyanna for some. Are arranged marriages really this wonderful? Does love really come after marriage? Well, no, and sometimes. VIVAH is a celebration of this institution and is, for all purposes, a Bollywood fairy tale, an idealization of arranged matrimony. As such, it's about as real and convincing as, well, as a Bollywood motion picture. Would that all arranged marriages work as well as this one did.",4,"After the engagement, the courtship begins...",1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,5429,"['So', 'just', 'once', 'hip', 'modern', 'values',

Prem (Shahid Kapoor) is the handsome son of a wealthy industrialist and he's dragging his feet about marriage--until the sight of Poonam rocks him back on his heels. Arranged marriage is very foreign to most Americans, but when seen from the perspective of the parties involved, it doesn't seem so strange. The couple decides after one meeting (with their families)--during which sparks fly--that they want to marry. Talk about speed dating! But it's surprisingly romantic. As the families prepare for the wedding and the couple embarks on a sweet post-engagement courtship, there's little conflict in the story, but with all the delicious tension between the two lead characters, who are going to burst if they don't get their hands on each other, who cares? And when conflict finally comes two-thirds of the way through the film, putting their love to the test, it's a doozy. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",5,Must See,1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,1200,"['beautiful', 'orphan', 'named', 'Poonam', 'played', 'Amrita', 'Rao', 'despised', 'jealous', 'aunt', 'who', 'raised', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'ugly', 'cousin', 'sister', 'kind', 'uncle', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'marry', 'Prem', 'Shahid', 'Kapoor', 'handsome', 'son', 'wealthy', 'industrialist', 'dragging', 'feet', 'marriage', 'sight', 'Poonam', 'back', 'heels', 'Arranged', 'marriage', 'very', 'foreign', 'most', 'Americans', 'when', 'seen', 'perspective', 'parties', 'involved', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'strange', 'couple', 'one', 'meeting', 'families', 'fly', 'want', 'marry', 'Talk', 'speed', 'dating', 'surprisingly', 'romantic', 'families', 'prepare', 'wedding', 'couple', 'sweet', 'post-engagement', 'courtship', 'little', 'conflict', 'story', 'delicious', 'tension', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'burst', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hands', 'other', 'who', 'when', 'conflict', 'finally', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'film', 'putting', 'love', 'test', 'doozy', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",Vivah

The acting was great, although the bride's character is so demure and shy that you feel like pulling out your hair at times.

Pickford ""M-Life""","[0, 4]","I don't mind Hindi films which espouse traditional values - in fact, I like them - but this film is so old-school it's ridiculous.Poonam (Amrita Rao) is a sweet-hearted, beautiful girl adopted into a poor family. She accepts a marriage proposal from the wealthy (but yes, you guessed it) down-to-earth and traditional Prem (Shahid Kapoor). They of course fall madly in love.During this part of the movie Poonam seems to have turned the coy/bashful dial up to 11 - she must have got paid on the basis of how many times she shyly lowered her eyelids. Prem seems to think `romantic earnestness' means `speaking in a creepy whisper while wearing jeans'. Shahid Kapoor is a great dancer, and he barely moves. What a waste!Poonam's adoptive mother Rama (Seema Biswas) hates Poonam, at least partially because she's way better looking than her own daughter Rajni (Amrita Prakash), and is jealous of all the attention Poonam gets due to the wedding. Then, on the brink of marriage, tragedy strikes - and Vivah gets slightly better at this point, with some proper acting occurring.While the camera work is generally of a high standard, director Sooraj Barjatya (or his cinematographer, whoever's responsible) needs to stop using fish-eye lenses to get everything in frame. It seems to me to be a bit of a filmi staple, and it is very distracting. The colours are beautiful though - most scenes are a delight to look at.The music is forgettable. Many scenes have synth orchestras, which really give the movie a mid-90s TV movie feel. Also, very important - the copy I received is very poor quality.

Every performance was flawless , and only a slight delay in the perfect subtitles so if you miss this one you will regret it . You will see young people growing into young lovers dreaming and planning and then when tragedy strikes , stepping up to the plate and both being so brave it leaves you speechless . This is an excellent showcase script. Beautiful music and songs are  written into the movie, not twirling around it.  I fell in love and then deep respect with all the characters even the mother figure who is so conflicted is allowed to be a human being and not a caricature of writers. This movie doesn't make you feel like an outsider looking in. From the moment it starts you feel it drawing you in to it's warm embrace to be a part of something bigger than yourself. You will find yourself constantly smiling and laughing at their little ways that feel so much a part of you that by the end of the movie you want to watch it again because you miss them already. There will be tears of course . Our young heroine is very heroic indeed. Don't worry this is Bollywood.

1053326,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B000N3TWRG,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[1, 1]","Forgive the Mary Poppins moment but I can think of no higher compliment for this movie. Just know that I watched this on Amazon Instant Video so I can't vouch for the quality of a DVD. I can highly recommend it without even one instant of hesitation. If you're looking for a clean, genuine love story that the entire family can enjoy and learn from this is IT! I laughed and cried so hard I thought I'd hyperventilate. Truly this is one of the finest Bollywood films I've seen to-date. Like most Bollywood movies the subject is marriage and the trials and joys that come with family. What makes this movie special is that it presents its ideals not just as mere entertainment but blatantly lets its audience know, ""This might not be the way things ARE, but this is how they SHOULD BE!"" All I can say is that I heartily concur!Poonam is an extraordinarily beautiful girl whose been brought up in her Uncle's home as his own child after her parents tragic deaths. Adored by her uncle and younger cousin, she has a happy life in all ways but one. Her aunt can't stand the sight of her! Now I think it's vitally important that my fellow Western viewers have a bit of background to understand the cultural divergences here with this particular plot-point, so please forgive the spoilers but they are necessary. In India, standards of beauty vary a great deal from the most common western ones.When we think of ""fair skin"" we think of someone like Nicole Kidman, and by-and-large, ""fairness"" isn't considered the ultimate standard of beauty, especially here in the USA society likes tans, and spends millions of dollars every year on UV tanning beds and bottles of self-tanners. For those who don't want to shell out cash, or be bothered booking an appointment, they lay out in the sun risking skin cancer all the name of the prized bronzed body. Me I got over it years ago, sunburn hurts! And I'm not keen on looking like an oompa-loompa.In India the lighter your skin-tone the more beautiful you're considered to be. There, bleaching creams (which is really just an ad name for creams that even out skin tone, we have them here too) are prized, and anything no matter how nuts it may sound that promises lighter skin is greedily consumed by masses of people. And why not? People get rejected as possible marriage material, lose out on jobs, and get shafted in all sorts of ways if they're considered ""too dark."" It's a sad and controversial state of affairs. But really every culture has some sort of beauty nemeses to deal with, whether it's weight, a woman's ""assets,"" or a man's for that matter. But if you don't have a proper understanding of the cultural values here you will miss out on one of the movie's major themes.Anyway, Poonam is ""fair"" but her cousin Chhoti is ""dark"" this causes a bitter hatred to well up in the aunt because she's insanely jealous of the so-called blessings that Poonam seems to have because of her immense beauty. Her hatred blinds her to such an extent that she doesn't see that beauty of face and body is the LAST reason people love her so much. Poonam's true beauty is the beauty of her character and her heart.As usual, when the daughter's reach a proper age they must be married off, so when a family friend comes on business and the Uncle laments that he can't find a boy worthy of Poonam in their city, the friend immediately replies he knows the perfect family that not only has an upstanding boy, but would welcome her into their family and house without any of the common nightmare scenarios that can accompany marriage in India. So photo is taken and the fun begins...Prem is what a girl like me would call a bloody miracle! Handsome, Charming, Polite, Well-Educated, Respectful, and *most* importantly, GENUINELY KIND. Let's face it, a kind person is a dying breed in this world, male or female. His dad has been looking at prospective brides for him and after seeing Poonam's picture, he decides that Prem must at least meet her. Prem isn't exactly jumping for joy, (he's afraid he's not ready for marriage) but he's a good boy and after seeing the photo himself he decides not to object.Well, I'm not going to give the whole thing away, but from then on out it's a beautiful love story that blossoms perfectly. I usually don't mind that Bollywood isn't much for kissing in these family films but I found myself yelling at the TV ""OMG kiss him on the cheek at least!"" It's such a beautiful relationship that a kiss couldn't possibly be considered cheap or titillating. But no kiss. They don't shy away from desire though, as the story unfolds and the relationship deepens, BOTH the hero and the heroine make no apologies about the passion that develops for each other. HOWEVER, all is kept in it's proper place, and neither has any desire to act in any way that might bring any reproach on themselves, their families, or even their own love for each other. Sadly, such values are nearly dead and gone in this part of the world, and those who try to live by them are mocked and severely ridiculed. I definitely recommend this movie for ANYONE who is trying to live their life in such a way. It's highly encouraging even for old maids like me!Of course, in Typical Bollywood fare some sort of tragedy must occur to possibly destroy the happy Jodi, but in this case, it leads to such splendid moments of love in action that it took my breath away! I'm not even going to hint at what they are, YOU MUST WATCH! Trust me, it's well worth the time!Production and direction, Sooraj R. Barjatya has hooked me as an admirer. I like his simplicity, and the fact that he doesn't go for a lot of opulent and lavish trimmings. It wouldn't have fit the story at all, Prem's family is wealthy but there's none of the intimidating grandeur of the Richand's inKabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...or the glam of the Khanna's inMujhse Dosti Karoge. Poonam's family is comfortable, but far from wealthy. Still, both families in their respective surroundings create a sense of warmth and closeness that ALL families should have. The director skillfully, uses locations and weaves his story through skillful use of an above average cast. The costumes and makeup are both lovely as well.Performances, I've been quite a fan of Shahid Kapur for a long time now. I love him in,Dil Bole Hadippaand although some of his movies like ""Kismet Konnection,"" and ""Chance Pe Dance"" are WAY BELOW par, he is never bad himself. Here he's just lovely. Prem might be all goodness and light, but he's not impractical or nave. He has a good head on his shoulders and great humility. If I had to complain about anything it would be he never got a chance to bust out his amazing dancing. He is fantastic in this film.I've heard of Amitra Rao a lot but this is the first film I've ever seen with her in it. She's lovely, subtle, and a wonderful compliment to her leading man. She definitely disproves the idea that a nice ""good girl"" is someone boring and without depth. She is far from boring, and although Poonam is shy and rather reserved in her demeanor, Ms. Rao certainly understands that ""still waters run deep."" While her feelings for Prem develop cautiously, once in full bloom she is just as passionate in her love as he is. Her selflessness never translates into self-righteousness, and her goodness is never something she holds over others. She isn't a good person because others approve of her, she's a good person because she chooses to be one for herself first. The script does a lot here to help keep Poonam likeable, BUT it takes a deft hand when dealing with such a character and Ms. Rao did a splendid job. I'll have to watch more of her films.Anupam Kher and Alok Nath are superb as Prem and Poonam's respective fathers! I cannot praise each of them enough. I knew I've seen Alok Nath in movies before I just couldn't remember which, and lo' and behold he's in two of my very favorites,Na Tum Jaano Na HumandKabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...it's amazing how if you change a mustache the entire face can change.Seema Biswass is chilling as the Aunt! I wanted her to just be so totally and completely punished for the hatred she showed not only poor Poonam but her husband and Chhoti as well, alas in Bollywood a lot of mercy is shown to most of the negative characters, and I should learn something from it. Still, phenomenal performance! The fact that I loathed and despised her proves that.Amitra Parakesh plays Chhoti, and despite her mother's despair with her skin, she's a lively, happy, firecracker of a girl, who isn't the least bit self-conscious about her looks, and happily jokes about them. To me she's an exceptionally pretty girl, but that's where the cultural differences come in. She is not even the tiniest bit uncomfortable with her beautiful cousin and older sister. She does however have issues with her mother and rightly so!Samir Soni is lovely as Prem's older brother. Sunil is a bit of a workaholic but a wonderful husband, father, son and brother. He's also the family's go to crises manager.Lata Sabharwal, plays the greatest sister-in-law in the world. She's also an exceptional wife and mother. Her role brings a real sense of fun and energy to the story.Finally, Ameya Pandya I love the child actors in Bollywood, I really do! Rahul is everything I hope my nephews grow to be. And he's in another favorite of mineLafangey Parindey (Yash Raj Films New Hindi Film / Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema DVD)and completely different but just as good.Songs, I love how they used the songs to tell us the thoughts of the characters and all very pretty. No real dances which is a shame but it did fit the film.All in all, who knew 79$ and a new Amazon Prime Membership would have me this satisfied in two hours.",5,Practically Perfect In Every
