888424,A3HSSS8C4GHMAZ,B0007R4TFS,Mr. Gareth G. Bull,"[6, 12]","Thats right! When I watch this I see heavy influences of western animation which for one make question wether this is an anime or a western cartoon that was created just to be played on cartoon network.Putting the style aside this would still seem like a kid's cartoon with a simple plot, little character development and the basic formula for an episode being;Bad guy encounter, Fight (+ Metal guitars), Bad guy defeated, Jubei Moves along... till another bad guy wants a fight and the process is repeated. This can be entertaining if you dont demand much from the show. But predictable fights equal no suspense... and ultimatley no care for what happens next.The Music ""oh god the music!"" since when did they have electric guitars in feudal japan. The music isn't authentic to match the times of Jubei's adventures, its an awful clash of repetetive grunge guitar riffs, and it usually kicks in when there's a fight... I guess the director wanted to pump the action scenes up using this approach with their choice of music. It sounds very average, with synth sounds emulating pan pipes etc.For over 4 episodes I kept hoping for something to hook me in, something to help me forget about the monotomy of encounters. But I could'nt use any more of my time on this series it fell greatly below my expectations and couldn't help feeling the main target audience for the show were early teens. So I felt like I was treated like a kid (in a condesending manner) by series. But I really can't understand why they would choose to make such a series with such a target audience. I mean, the film was an 18 so this series just made no sense to me at all.I ask alot from my anime so I am quite demanding. If you dont have the same concerns for anime as I do, there's a chance you can find something entertaining here. Though anime's such as Blue Gender makes this 'cartoon' seem like childs play.Yes, I bought the whole series but I dont have to watch it all.
