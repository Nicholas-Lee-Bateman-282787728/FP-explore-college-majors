There is no doubt other well done shows, but this miniseries captures the novel ( One of the greatest novels written ) in a wonderful way. The cast was first rate and when I see Bill Devane, I have no choice but to say ""aw, the poor horse"". You need to hear it from him with his Irish Accent. I suggest all adults and children alike to experience this great production in all it's glory. The book was adapted by Peter S. Fischer of ""Columbo"" and ""Murder, She Wrote"" fame. His other miniseries ""Once an Eagle"" is being released in August and his short lived gem ""Ellery Queen"" is being released in September.I recommend all these shows to all.thank you,Chris FischerOnce An Eagle starring Sam Elliott!

We searched for it often and never found it.  I remembered that William DeVane was in it and always used his name search as a means to determine if it was ""the one"".  I was surprised when I saw that it was available and purchased it right away.  We watched it and even though our memories of a great movie can change over time, we still found it to be a rewarding experience in watching it again.  I recommend this version of Black Beauty as a good family movie to watch together like my family did.",5,Black Beauty is back,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",2012,622,"['saw', 'version', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'television', 'special', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'versions', 'had', 'seen', 'searched', 'often', 'never', 'found', 'remembered', 'William', 'DeVane', 'was', 'always', 'used', 'name', 'search', 'means', 'determine', 'was', 'one', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'available', 'purchased', 'right', 'away', 'watched', 'even', 'memories', 'great', 'movie', 'can', 'change', 'time', 'still', 'found', 'be', 'rewarding', 'experience', 'watching', 'again', 'recommend', 'version', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'good', 'family', 'movie', 'watch', 'together', 'family', 'did']",N/A
1335945,A27B62Y9LP7Q8P,B003BNCMT0,"leighann ""leighann1001""","[6, 6]","First, I agree with the other reviewer about the picture quality. The first episode had a white line down the middle of the screen. The whole thing looked like something that was tape-recorded off of TV 20 years ago. I have old tapes on my shelf that are about the same quality. They could have cleaned it up a little before releasing it. As for the story, the events stuck very close to the book. They set it in and around Baltimore in the 1880s, but the progression of owners and situations was the same up until the end, when Beauty was bought by Farmer Gray's now-grown son. A lot of the movie was more about the people than about the horses. I forwarded through Farmer Gray's son's life in New York. I missed hearing more of Beauty's point of view. After the run for the doctor and back, you didn't get a sense of just how sick he really was and how he longed for John Manly. I would like to have had more about Ginger's background and more of Merrylegs, period. Merrylegs wasn't in the book a whole lot, either, but he was such a character you can't help but like him. He might as well have not even been in the movie for all we saw of him. We didn't hear anything of Ginger's background, so you didn't know why she reacted so badly to the check rein and didn't feel much sympathy for her. I also didn't see any need to for Ginger to have been sold immediately after that incident. They had Lizzie who was described as bad tempered so it's not like all of their horses had perfect temperaments. They combined Beauty seeing Ginger again and Beauty and Jerry's Sunday fare into one scene and didn't do justice to either one. That was disappointing as those were such good scenes in the book. The scene where Beauty can't get the load up the hill could have been done better. In the book, you get the idea he's climbing a steep hill and fighting every step of the way with a sore, aching neck and back and you really feel for his situation. In the movie, the road looks flat and if you weren't familiar with the story, you'd be surprised when the carter says it's a hill. The lady convinced him to remove the check rein and Beauty didn't so much as shake his head around, then he pulled the cart all of about five feet to the top of the ""hill"". The scene didn't have the feel that it should have. Mostly I missed hearing Beauty's point of view through a lot of the situations. If they'd had a little less of Luke Gray, they could have had a little more of the horses.",3,"Not bad, but could have been better",1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,2470,"['First', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewer', 'picture', 'quality', 'first', 'episode', 'had', 'white', 'line', 'middle', 'screen', 'whole', 'thing', 'looked', 'something', 'was', 'tape-recorded', 'TV', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'old', 'tapes', 'shelf', 'are', 'same', 'quality', 'could', 'have', 'cleaned', 'up', 'little', 'releasing', 'story', 'events', 'stuck', 'very', 'close', 'book', 'set', 'Baltimore', '1880s', 'progression', 'owners', 'situations', 'was', 'same', 'up', 'end', 'when', 'Beauty', 'was', 'bought', 'Farmer', 'Gray', 'now-grown', 'son', 'lot', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'people', 'horses', 'forwarded', 'Farmer', 'Gray', 'son', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'missed', 'hearing', 'more', 'Beauty', 'point', 'view', 'run', 'doctor', 'back', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'just', 'how', 'sick', 'really', 'was', 'how', 'longed', 'John', 'Manly', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'Ginger', 'background', 'more', 'Merrylegs', 'period', 'Merrylegs', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'whole', 'lot', 'either', 'was', 'such', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'been', 'movie', 'saw', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'anything', 'Ginger', 'background', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'reacted', 'so', 'badly', 'check', 'rein', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'much', 'sympathy', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'need', 'Ginger', 'have', 'been', 'sold', 'immediately', 'incident', 'had', 'Lizzie', 'who', 'was', 'described', 'bad', 'tempered', 'not', 'horses', 'had', 'perfect', 'temperaments', 'combined', 'Beauty', 'seeing', 'Ginger', 'again', 'Beauty', 'Jerry', 'Sunday', 'fare', 'one', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'one', 'was', 'disappointing', 'were', 'such', 'good', 'scenes', 'book', 'scene', 'where', 'Beauty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'load', 'up', 'hill', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'book', 'get', 'idea', 'climbing', 'steep', 'hill', 'fighting', 'step', 'way', 'sore', 'aching', 'neck', 'back', 'really', 'feel', 'situation', 'movie', 'road', 'flat', 'were', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'story', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'carter', 'hill', 'lady', 'convinced', 'remove', 'check', 'rein', 'Beauty', 'did', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'shake', 'head', 'around', 'then', 'pulled', 'cart', 'five', 'feet', 'top', 'hill', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'feel', 'should', 'have', 'Mostly', 'missed', 'hearing', 'Beauty', 'point', 'view', 'lot', 'situations', ""'d"", 'had', 'little', 'less', 'Luke', 'Gray', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'horses']",N/A
1335946,A1K4AVQIU704DY,B003BNCMT0,"Nancy Sherburne ""a Phil Ochs fan""","[0, 0]","I remember when this had aired on NBC for I imagine three consecutive nights as it was a long mini-series with commercials. I forget if I taped it on VHS its first airing, or, if there was a second airing, at that time, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Why shouldn't I with so many famous actors such as Van Johnson, Peter Breck, Martin Milner and Diane Muldaur. The setting, though, was not England but Virginia, and Ginger was not a fiery chestnut but gray.. The plot is very close to Anna Sewell's novel so I need not go into it except the thrust of the movie was a promise a boy made to Black Beauty to look after him. The movie followed Beauty's path from his birthplace to the Gordons, to the Earl and his haughty wife, to a cab driver and finally to Skinner, Beauty's last abusive owner. When the poor horse was played out the man put him in a horse fair. Enter the boy who had promised to take care of him, and, well, good things come to those who wait. So much here I enjoyed, like watching how the wife of Gordon's coachman John Manly scrubs their floor, or how Beauty got to playing in the meadow with his cab-driver owner. It truly is time well spent in watching this delight and I was so surprised to see it released on DVD and on Amazon, and I recommend it to anyone who loves horses whether they read the book it was based on or not.",4,What A Surprise,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,1344,"['remember', 'when', 'had', 'aired', 'NBC', 'imagine', 'three', 'consecutive', 'nights', 'was', 'long', 'mini-series', 'commercials', 'forget', 'taped', 'VHS', 'first', 'airing', 'was', 'second', 'airing', 'time', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Why', 'should', ""n't"", 'so', 'many', 'famous', 'actors', 'such', 'Van', 'Johnson', 'Peter', 'Breck', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'Diane', 'Muldaur', 'setting', 'was', 'not', 'England', 'Virginia', 'Ginger', 'was', 'not', 'fiery', 'chestnut', 'plot', 'very', 'close', 'Anna', 'Sewell', 'novel', 'so', 'need', 'not', 'go', 'thrust', 'movie', 'was', 'promise', 'boy', 'made', 'Black', 'Beauty', 'look', 'movie', 'followed', 'Beauty', 'path', 'birthplace', 'Gordons', 'Earl', 'haughty', 'wife', 'cab', 'driver', 'finally', 'Skinner', 'Beauty', 'last', 'abusive', 'owner', 'When', 'poor', 'horse', 'was', 'played', 'out', 'man', 'put', 'horse', 'fair', 'Enter', 'boy', 'who', 'had', 'promised', 'take', 'care', 'well', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'who', 'wait', 'So', 'much', 'here', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'how', 'wife', 'Gordon', 'coachman', 'John', 'Manly', 'scrubs', 'floor', 'how', 'Beauty', 'got', 'playing', 'meadow', 'cab-driver', 'owner', 'truly', 'time', 'well', 'spent', 'watching', 'delight', 'was', 'so', 'surprised', 'see', 'released', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'horses', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'not']",N/A
