1356991,A2582KMXLK2P06,B003PU82CU,B. E Jackson,"[2, 5]","Though performed and released in 2010, Bill Maher once again makes plenty of good points in But I'm Not Wrong (accurate title too- he's *not* wrong, hardly ever!)  I had a feeling going into this comedy routine that Bill's views on religion are, let's just say, less friendly compared to other views, haha.  He pretty much confirmed where he stands on religious matters on an episode of Jay Leno about a year ago.  He basically describes God and Jesus as fictional characters that people have been making up for over 2,000 years.  Do I agree with this?  Hmmm, haha.  Not really.  Mildly funny regardless though *incredibly* offensive to a person who's deeply religious (and understandably so).The political side of the routine is sort of dated now.  Sarah Palin, John McCain, the inauguration of Barack Obama, George Bush, Hillary and Bill Clinton... these people are quite the topic of Bill's conversation since they were relevant and newsworthy in 2010.My feelings overall on Bill Maher after watching this comedy special is that he makes several good points, is very offensive, nearly impossible to disagree with (except concerning the subject of religion of course which has always been debatable) and probably won't become religious any time soon... and neither will I.  However he's only funny about half the time.  Making good points and being funny aren't always one and the same, but humor is a matter of preference anyway.

The auditorium appears to be full, sold out. This is the full hour and a half of his one man stand up show.Maher's rant is beginning to show its age. His routine hasn't changed much in the last few years. Although the names are different, the jokes are pretty much the same. This show natters on for too long. Maher takes a good twenty minutes to warm up. He hits his stride at about one hour. The best jokes, most cutting commentary comes in the last twenty minutes.My complaint with this program is not Maher's politics, but the jokes just aren't as funny anymore. The surprise three minute encore, the Muslim Dior fashion show, over played it's hand, spent entirely too long on each model, and never really had a punch line (Maher reads from little blue cards). The jokes throughout the show were like this, set up for a fairly long time, telegraphed where they were going, delivered the punch line, and then reinforced the punch line for too many beats. This is a great method for teaching something, but not necessarily a method for comedians.It seemed to me that the audience wasn't laughing wildly at his jokes. Political and religious comedy has become a difficult domain. Maher pokes Republicans very squarely in the eye; there is a sense that he delivers equal time to the Fox News Network. But he does take that poking to an extreme. I think it is wonderful that we have somebody willing to defend a Democratic position, or at least common sense. I just wish he was funnier.Where Dennis Miller is way too cerebral and requires extreme current affairs knowledge to get his jokes; Maher is pretty easy to digest and does help the audience along explaining his jokes, he pushes the intellectual envelope for his audience. Maher shines in Politically Incorrect when he interviews his guests. Lively debate is something he does well. I have never been a huge fan of his monologue or stand up bits. This was a DVD of nothing but one long monologue.This is rated TV-MA, yes there is a lot of strong language in this performance. The performance flows aimlessly through mostly adult subjects, self pleasuring, defecating, marital relations, oral pleasure, and homosexual pleasures. The DVD is probably best suited for mature audiences.I used to really love Bill Maher. I found Religulous thought provoking and interesting to watch. This performance, I will likely forget soon. In a year or even six months, most of the jokes will be even less humorous.

No matter how one defines religion (including Bill Maher), religion is religion and God is God. The two are not the same. The way I see it, there are the many evolving religions of our world with their varying degrees of being God-Revealing (leading spiritually-minded truth-seeking soul-blossoming men and women to God). Then there are other so-called religions that have nothing to do with God (except that they use His Name, without permission, of course, to exert their powerfully manipulative control over others in a number of reprehensible ways not to exclude the rapid accumulation of material wealth achieved by gluttonously sucking the financial marrow from the monetary bones of their unsuspecting sheep, I mean...um, congregation). And then there is the personal religion of each faith-born child of God that is unique to each and every individual believer. That is primarily the one I am a big fan of. For the record (and because it is mainly how Mr. Maher mocked The Father and The Son in this show that triggered a critical response from me as expressed in this review), I make no claims about fully understanding The Paradise Trinity (but if my calculations are correct, I will have approximately all of eternity to ponder this intriguing mystery that for now I unequivocally accept by faith). I like the analogy of a tree with three branches more than others I've heard. One Tree. Three Branches. Tree = Trinity (Totality Quantity = 1). Three Branches = Father + Son + Spirit (Individuality Quantity = 3).

To his credit, he's usually cuttingly on target and his wit and facial ""verbiage"" must be heard AND seen to be appreciated. He pushes his comedy to the limit and spares no one. I loved this DVD.  My only reason for giving it four rather than five stars was that he seemed a little forced at times and not as comfortable with his delivery as I expected.

Sometimes I like his stand-up and sometimes I don't, but this one was HILARIOUS. I cried laughing at the bathroom stall leg stretch. There's about a 1% chance of me laughing at bodily humor jokes, but his analysis about why he doesn't open his legs that wide made tears come down my face. Outside of the crazy faces he makes, I wouldn't call Bill Maher a physical comedian. He's usually not as animated as comedian Martin Lawrence or actresses like Erika Alexander, but he did a lot of physical comedy in this film. The Michael Jackson Moonwalk and Ludacris ""Area Codes"" dance skit that he made into a semi-country style song made me fall out laughing again. He changed the entire beat of the song and made it sound way too happy go lucky. Just about every joke in here was a winner, minus the Muslim fashion show. He always comes down way too hard on an entire group of people because of a small percentage. Other than that, this one was a winner.
