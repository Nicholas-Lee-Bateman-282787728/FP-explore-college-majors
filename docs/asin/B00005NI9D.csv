668680,A37M1Y79UWPQ2P,B00005NI9D,E. Schmidt,"[6, 6]","For those of you who have already seen Prancer Returns, here is the lowdown on the DVD release.  Amazon's specs are incorrect; the movie is presented in Anamorphic Widescreen (16x9)!  This release has no real special features that can be accessed on a DVD player (the back of the case lists chapter selection as a special feature), although it does have a few DVD-ROM games that can be accessed on a computer.For those who are unfamiliar with the story, but are contemplating a purchase, let me advise ordering the original Prancer instead.  There isn't anything necessarily wrong with Prancer Returns, but it just feels like a rehash of the far superior original.  Prancer Returns has a passable, although predictable, story, which is quite reminiscent of the first film.  The story isn't as downbeat as the first, and features a few comedic bits; although the comedy generally detract from the overall feel and flow of the rest of the film.  The acting is a mixed bag.  Jack Palance turns in a great performance as the grouchy neighbor.  Gavin Fink does an acceptable job as the protagonist, but can't carry the movie nearly as well as the girl from the original Prancer.Prancer Returns is a good companion to the first movie.  Unfortunately, it also remind us of how much better the original is.",4,Good...But Stick To The Original,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,1298,"['who', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'Prancer', 'Returns', 'here', 'lowdown', 'DVD', 'release', 'Amazon', 'specs', 'are', 'incorrect', 'movie', 'presented', 'Anamorphic', 'Widescreen', '16x9', 'release', 'real', 'special', 'features', 'can', 'be', 'accessed', 'DVD', 'player', 'back', 'case', 'chapter', 'selection', 'special', 'feature', 'have', 'few', 'DVD-ROM', 'games', 'can', 'be', 'accessed', 'computer.For', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'story', 'are', 'contemplating', 'purchase', 'let', 'advise', 'ordering', 'original', 'Prancer', 'instead', ""n't"", 'anything', 'necessarily', 'wrong', 'Prancer', 'Returns', 'just', 'feels', 'rehash', 'far', 'superior', 'original', 'Prancer', 'Returns', 'passable', 'predictable', 'story', 'quite', 'reminiscent', 'first', 'film', 'story', ""n't"", 'as', 'downbeat', 'first', 'few', 'comedic', 'bits', 'comedy', 'generally', 'detract', 'overall', 'feel', 'flow', 'rest', 'film', 'acting', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Jack', 'Palance', 'great', 'performance', 'grouchy', 'neighbor', 'Gavin', 'Fink', 'acceptable', 'job', 'protagonist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'carry', 'movie', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'girl', 'original', 'Prancer.Prancer', 'Returns', 'good', 'companion', 'first', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'remind', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'original']",N/A

What I like about the movie is that an eight-year old Charlie Holton's life is about to change. Deep in the mountain woods, he discovers a gangly baby reindeer, all alone. Believing this must be Prancer, Santa's reindeer, Charlie takes the gentle creature home to care for him until Christmas. Charlie even emails Santa Claus, telling him to pick up Prancer on nearby Antler Ridge on Christmas Eve. Charlie's quest to return the reindeer marks a dramatic change in the lives of Charlie and his family as, struggling and nearly broken, they are returned to love through the magical appearance of the reindeer. Prancer Returns is the story of how one boy's faith in humanity can bring hope and happiness to a family, a town, and especially to himself.

It is obvious who the divorced mother will end up with, the reindeer will actually be one of Santa's and the unpleasant person will get his just dues, but the way the events unfold make it a really enjoyable story.
