My only complaint is that I have found two episodes in Season 2 that chopped off the credits of the show, and I have to ask Timeless Media Group WHY??? However, don't let this deter you from adding this series to your collection, it is an EXCELLENT show & I treasure having it in my classic TV show library.Update: I emailed Timeless Media Group about the above concern & they replied as follows: ""For many of the archival films we release, the most problematic elements are the program opens, commercial breaks and closing credits. If there is significant damage to a film, it usually is present in these areas. For the open, we can usually use a clean copy from another episode and that will suffice, but the closing credits are specific to each episode, so we can't just swap them around.""",4,Almost 5 Stars except for a small flaw,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,920,"['WANTED', 'give', 'Deputy', 'Complete', 'Series', '5', 'stars', 'so', 'bad', '.the', 'video', 'audio', 'very', 'good', 'have', 'complaints', 'here', 'My', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'found', 'two', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'chopped', 'credits', 'show', 'have', 'ask', 'Timeless', 'Media', 'Group', 'WHY', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', 'adding', 'series', 'collection', 'EXCELLENT', 'show', 'treasure', 'having', 'classic', 'TV', 'show', 'library.Update', 'emailed', 'Timeless', 'Media', 'Group', 'above', 'concern', 'replied', 'many', 'archival', 'films', 'release', 'most', 'problematic', 'elements', 'are', 'program', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'closing', 'credits', 'significant', 'damage', 'film', 'usually', 'present', 'areas', 'open', 'can', 'usually', 'use', 'clean', 'copy', 'episode', 'will', 'suffice', 'closing', 'credits', 'are', 'specific', 'episode', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'swap', 'around']",N/A

1379782,A2K7N2E8V89EVN,B004164P8W,J Resb,"[7, 7]","A partial release of The Deputy came out awhile ago, so I was very happy to receive my Amazon recommendation that this new, all-episodes collection had come out.  We've been going through these episodes several at a time, with regular TV so frequently weak.  The episodes are short but well acted, produced, and filmed.  One pleasant surprise is that the sound is fine, too, and with a series this old, that's a real accomplishment for the restoration team. Stories are almost all serious; you don't see the characters thrown into silly, weak attempts at humorous episodes as happened so often with Bonanza or Laredo. Sometimes a story suddenly wraps up, but that can happen with any show.  It's not The Henry Fonda Show, if that's what you're looking for, but he's in almost every episode, spending several minutes on screen as the Chief Marshall guiding his shopkeeper sidekick and deputizing him to solve the task of the day.  It's the only show I can think of where the shopkeeper is portrayed as equal to the task of tackling the bad guys; usually that's reserved to grizzled, bar-busting gunslinging tough guys, occasionally overwritten to be superhuman. There is one small drawback, not the fault of the writers so much as of American portrayals of Western culture at that time:  that's the Gabby Hayes/'Detective' Watson buffoon sitting sheriff, who's generally just in the way, getting bumped aside (wisely) so Henry and his real (part time) deputy can restore order.  As a writer's gimmick to lighten the mood, he's a minor irritant, like fuzz on the screen, easily disregarded in the context of the storyline.  Today we watched eight episodes in a row, enjoying the entire stretch.
