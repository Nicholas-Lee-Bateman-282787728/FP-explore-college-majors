Audrey does return, though. The plot is that while on a tour of an island Uncle Eddy and the gang get marooned on an island. There they have to work to survive. They need each other. It all turns out to be a pretty good film. However, this does not even compare to the other National Lampoom films. And it certainly doesn't compare to the first Christmas Vacation. Sure it does have its laughs and funny parts, but it still doesn't come close to the others.",2,Not the best Lampoom movie,1213660800,"06 17, 2008",2008,571,"['Christmas', 'Vacation', 'Uncle', 'Eddy', 'star', 'show', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Clark', ""n't"", 'appear', 'one', 'bit', 'Audrey', 'return', 'plot', 'tour', 'island', 'Uncle', 'Eddy', 'gang', 'get', 'marooned', 'island', 'have', 'work', 'survive', 'need', 'other', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'However', 'not', 'even', 'compare', 'other', 'National', 'Lampoom', 'films', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'compare', 'first', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'Sure', 'have', 'laughs', 'funny', 'parts', 'still', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'others']",NAT'L  LAMPOONS CHRISTMAS VACATION 2 (DV
779930,A33UCQJ1QHU8B,B0000DZ3IE,Andy Radke,"[6, 8]","I saw this on NBC last December. I didn't watch it with high expectations, nor did I expect it to live up to it's predecessor (National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation), but what I was hoping for was something at least remotely amusing which would kill a couple of hours. Needless to say, I was asking for TOO much.This movie stinks on so many levels. First of all, aside from the mention of &quot;Christmas&quot; three or four times, the average person wouldn't know this was intended to be a &quot;Christmas&quot; movie. The family gets stranded on a deserted island (a la Swiss Family Robinson). There's your plot. They try to build a shelter......and fail. They look for food.....and fail. It's definitely nothing more than a big yawn-fest.They could've at least made the movie &quot;look&quot; real. The scene when the family is on the boat, you could tell the entire sky and water back-drop was blue-screened. There were no shadows what-so-ever. I've never seen anything look so fake.The only thing I remotely enjoyed about this was the presence of the original actress who portrayed Audrey in the original &quot;Vacation&quot; flick. But then, even her acting abilities were something yet to be desired.Now, with all of this being said. I AM going to get this. Call it a completist's curse or whatever. I have to collect my sequels, good or bad. So this will sit and collect dust right next to the far superior, far more enjoyable, and far more satisfying &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; we've come to know and love.But if you're not an obsessive collector like myself, I highly suggest you give this a rent before spending your hard earned money purchasing this disgrace of a film. Why this was given the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; seal of approval is beyond me. If I could give this less than 1 star, I most definitely would.",1,Terrible Movie.......REALLY Terrible,1090540800,"07 23, 2004",2004,1832,"['saw', 'NBC', 'last', 'December', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'high', 'expectations', 'did', 'expect', 'live', 'up', 'predecessor', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'what', 'was', 'hoping', 'was', 'something', 'least', 'remotely', 'amusing', 'would', 'kill', 'couple', 'hours', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'asking', 'TOO', 'much.This', 'movie', 'stinks', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'First', 'aside', 'mention', 'quot', 'Christmas', 'quot', 'three', 'four', 'times', 'average', 'person', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'quot', 'Christmas', 'quot', 'movie', 'family', 'stranded', 'deserted', 'island', 'la', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'plot', 'try', 'build', 'shelter', 'fail', 'look', 'food', '..and', 'fail', 'definitely', 'nothing', 'more', 'big', 'yawn-fest.They', 'could', ""'ve"", 'least', 'made', 'movie', 'quot', 'quot', 'real', 'scene', 'when', 'family', 'boat', 'could', 'tell', 'entire', 'sky', 'water', 'back-drop', 'was', 'blue-screened', 'were', 'shadows', 'what-so-ever', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'look', 'fake.The', 'only', 'thing', 'remotely', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'presence', 'original', 'actress', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Audrey', 'original', 'quot', 'Vacation', 'quot', 'flick', 'then', 'even', 'acting', 'abilities', 'were', 'something', 'yet', 'be', 'desired.Now', 'being', 'said', 'AM', 'going', 'get', 'Call', 'completist', 'curse', 'have', 'collect', 'sequels', 'good', 'bad', 'will', 'sit', 'collect', 'dust', 'right', 'next', 'far', 'superior', 'far', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'far', 'more', 'satisfying', 'quot', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'love.But', ""'re"", 'not', 'obsessive', 'collector', 'highly', 'suggest', 'give', 'rent', 'spending', 'hard', 'earned', 'money', 'purchasing', 'disgrace', 'film', 'Why', 'was', 'given', 'quot', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'quot', 'seal', 'approval', 'could', 'give', 'less', '1', 'star', 'most', 'definitely', 'would']",NAT'L  LAMPOONS CHRISTMAS VACATION 2 (DV
779931,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0000DZ3IE,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[5, 7]","I really wanted to like this. I really wanted there to be another fun new chapter in the Vacation series. And this one focused solely on Cousin Eddie and his family. It could of been a blast. Instead, it was a bust. I should have known from the start that a Vacation movie without Chevy Chase, Beverly D' Angelo, and the rest of the Griswald brood, wouldn't measure to much of anything. It was evident from the start that this was a rushed job. It was cheesy, and written and directed as if it were some lame, direct to TV hatchett job. Oh wait. That's right. What is also upsetting is that it was written by Matty Simmons. A guy who was with all the other Vacation films. Matty, surely you know how a good Vacation movie should be!. Randy Quaid is back as everybody's favorite bumbling doofus, Cousin Eddie. Miriam Flynn also returns as his wife Catherine. Seeing the two again, and together, is nice to see. I will give them that. And it's nice that the two actors know that these roles are theirs, and no one else will do. Eddie and the fam are staying with Audrey Griswald(who is played by the original Audrey from the first Vacation, Dana Barron). This is the one good and interesting move the writer gave the film. Eddie loses yet another job and the holidays are fast approaching. There is some ridiculous mumbo jumbo at work and all, and soon Eddie and the clan are off on a tropical island adventure, along with Audrey and his old, curmudgeonly father(Ed Asner). I could of said more about it, but why bother?. It doesn't really matter. The film clunks along like it has nowhere to go and just moves along waiting to get to a point to show off how clumsy and a loser Eddie is. All in the eyes of his little son, who he wants to feel proud of his dad. You can feel sorry for Quaid, but I think he could of known what crap this is. Still, he does Cousin Eddie like he always does, and he is always great. Everyone likes Eddie, and this will be no exception. You just wish there was more to like around him. Asner can be the old curmudgeon, but here he seems to just channel every cliche of that kind of character. If only he could put a little more Lou Grant-zest to the proceedings. Flynn is always endearing and likeable, and she is here. But even she can't hold anything together. The only good thing I liked about this mess, and the only good thing Simmons put in his script, was the return of Audrey. At least he knew one Griswald should be here. But the great part about it was that it was Dana Barron. The original Audrey. This is something I always thought the big screen films should have done. Barron is undeniably cute, and she looks fantastic. You can't believe it has been 20 years or so since the original, and she still looks like a kid. Unbelieveable. All in all, this is a film designed to be overlooked and forgotten very quickly. How very sad for a great character. I have seen Chevy recently, and he looks great. Still looks like Clark. Let's get him back on the screen with a Vacation everyone wants to see. But this one, boy, this one just gets coal in it's stocking.",1,Ho Ho Hum,1099267200,"11 1, 2004",2004,3096,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'really', 'wanted', 'be', 'fun', 'new', 'chapter', 'Vacation', 'series', 'one', 'focused', 'solely', 'Cousin', 'Eddie', 'family', 'could', 'been', 'blast', 'Instead', 'was', 'bust', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'start', 'Vacation', 'movie', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Beverly', 'D', 'Angelo', 'rest', 'Griswald', 'brood', 'would', ""n't"", 'measure', 'much', 'anything', 'was', 'evident', 'start', 'was', 'rushed', 'job', 'was', 'cheesy', 'written', 'directed', 'were', 'lame', 'direct', 'TV', 'hatchett', 'job', 'Oh', 'wait', 'right', 'What', 'also', 'upsetting', 'was', 'written', 'Matty', 'Simmons', 'A', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'other', 'Vacation', 'films', 'Matty', 'surely', 'know', 'how', 'good', 'Vacation', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'back', 'everybody', 'favorite', 'bumbling', 'doofus', 'Cousin', 'Eddie', 'Miriam', 'Flynn', 'also', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'Seeing', 'two', 'again', 'together', 'nice', 'see', 'will', 'give', 'nice', 'two', 'actors', 'know', 'roles', 'are', 'theirs', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'do', 'Eddie', 'fam', 'are', 'staying', 'Audrey', 'Griswald', 'who', 'played', 'original', 'Audrey', 'first', 'Vacation', 'Dana', 'Barron', 'one', 'good', 'interesting', 'move', 'writer', 'gave', 'film', 'Eddie', 'yet', 'job', 'holidays', 'are', 'fast', 'approaching', 'ridiculous', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'work', 'soon', 'Eddie', 'clan', 'are', 'tropical', 'island', 'adventure', 'Audrey', 'old', 'curmudgeonly', 'father', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'could', 'said', 'more', 'why', 'bother', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'film', 'clunks', 'nowhere', 'go', 'just', 'moves', 'along', 'waiting', 'get', 'point', 'show', 'off', 'how', 'clumsy', 'loser', 'Eddie', 'eyes', 'little', 'son', 'who', 'feel', 'proud', 'dad', 'can', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Quaid', 'think', 'could', 'known', 'what', 'crap', 'Still', 'Cousin', 'Eddie', 'always', 'always', 'great', 'Everyone', 'Eddie', 'will', 'be', 'exception', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'like', 'Asner', 'can', 'be', 'old', 'curmudgeon', 'here', 'just', 'channel', 'cliche', 'kind', 'character', 'only', 'could', 'put', 'little', 'more', 'Lou', 'Grant-zest', 'proceedings', 'Flynn', 'always', 'endearing', 'likeable', 'here', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'anything', 'together', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'liked', 'mess', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'Simmons', 'put', 'script', 'was', 'return', 'Audrey', 'least', 'knew', 'one', 'Griswald', 'should', 'be', 'here', 'great', 'part', 'was', 'was', 'Dana', 'Barron', 'original', 'Audrey', 'something', 'always', 'thought', 'big', 'screen', 'films', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'Barron', 'undeniably', 'cute', 'fantastic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'been', '20', 'years', 'so', 'original', 'still', 'kid', 'Unbelieveable', 'film', 'designed', 'be', 'overlooked', 'forgotten', 'very', 'quickly', 'How', 'very', 'sad', 'great', 'character', 'have', 'seen', 'Chevy', 'recently', 'great', 'Still', 'Clark', 'Let', 'get', 'back', 'screen', 'Vacation', 'everyone', 'see', 'one', 'boy', 'one', 'just', 'coal', 'stocking']",NAT'L  LAMPOONS CHRISTMAS VACATION 2 (DV
779932,AT57B36BHDQ00,B0000DZ3IE,Big Mike,"[14, 21]","As a great fan of the other Vacation films, I just purchased and watched this film despite reading the mostly negative reviews from other Amazon customers. Frankly, before I viewed the film I was worried that I may have wasted my money. On the contrary, I haven't laughed so much or so loudly for a very long time. I found it to be the funniest film I have seen for ages. I absolutely love Randy Quaid as the hilarious Cousin Eddie and Miriam Flynn is also excellent as his adoring and long-suffering wife Catherine. It was also nice to see the now grown-up and  curvaceous Dana Barron reprising her role from the first Vacation film as the original Audrey Griswold. Ed Asner is great (and very Lou Grant-like) in support as Eddie's grumpy and overly libidinous Uncle Nick. The entire cast is really good, including guest stars in cameos, such as Fred Willard, Beverly Garland and Eric Idle (reprising his role from European Vacation). It is really a very fun, pleasant, upbeat and entertaining film. I also love the original Vacation film and the original Christmas Vacation film. In my opinion, I definitely feel that this film is significantly better however, than both European Vacation and Vegas Vacation. It is nice to see Eddie given a film of his own. I feared that he might not be able to carry the film on his own, but I was wrong. Unfortunately though, the material begins to wear just a little bit thin during the last half-hour or so. Snots the farting Rottweiler is a scream. The film isn't perfect, but I personally feel that it was a most worthwhile purchase and I will definitely be watching it on a regular basis. The filming locations scenery is nice, as well. I thought they did a spendid job, especially considering the budget restrictions being a made for t.v. movie. The so-called professional critics never liked Gilligan's Island or The Brady Bunch, either. But for forty years now, Gilligan's Island has been a staple among television reruns due to it's ongoing popularity among the viewers. I would now like to see a new Vacation film made with all of the Griswolds and Eddie's family, maybe entitled National Lampoon's Cruise Vacation.",5,"Lighten up, it's not that bad, especially for a t.v. movie!!",1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,2163,"['great', 'fan', 'other', 'Vacation', 'films', 'just', 'purchased', 'watched', 'film', 'reading', 'mostly', 'negative', 'reviews', 'other', 'Amazon', 'customers', 'Frankly', 'viewed', 'film', 'was', 'worried', 'may', 'have', 'wasted', 'money', 'contrary', 'have', ""n't"", 'laughed', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'loudly', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'found', 'be', 'funniest', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'ages', 'absolutely', 'love', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'hilarious', 'Cousin', 'Eddie', 'Miriam', 'Flynn', 'also', 'excellent', 'adoring', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Catherine', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'now', 'grown-up', 'curvaceous', 'Dana', 'Barron', 'reprising', 'role', 'first', 'Vacation', 'film', 'original', 'Audrey', 'Griswold', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'great', 'very', 'Lou', 'Grant-like', 'support', 'Eddie', 'grumpy', 'overly', 'libidinous', 'Uncle', 'Nick', 'entire', 'cast', 'really', 'good', 'including', 'guest', 'stars', 'cameos', 'such', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'Beverly', 'Garland', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'reprising', 'role', 'European', 'Vacation', 'really', 'very', 'fun', 'pleasant', 'upbeat', 'entertaining', 'film', 'also', 'love', 'original', 'Vacation', 'film', 'original', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'film', 'opinion', 'definitely', 'feel', 'film', 'significantly', 'better', 'however', 'European', 'Vacation', 'Vegas', 'Vacation', 'nice', 'see', 'Eddie', 'given', 'film', 'own', 'feared', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'carry', 'film', 'own', 'was', 'wrong', 'Unfortunately', 'material', 'wear', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'thin', 'last', 'half-hour', 'so', 'Snots', 'farting', 'Rottweiler', 'scream', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'personally', 'feel', 'was', 'most', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'watching', 'regular', 'basis', 'filming', 'locations', 'scenery', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'thought', 'did', 'spendid', 'job', 'especially', 'considering', 'budget', 'restrictions', 'being', 'made', 't.v', 'movie', 'so-called', 'professional', 'critics', 'never', 'liked', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'either', 'forty', 'years', 'now', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'been', 'staple', 'television', 'reruns', 'due', 'ongoing', 'popularity', 'viewers', 'would', 'now', 'like', 'see', 'new', 'Vacation', 'film', 'made', 'Griswolds', 'Eddie', 'family', 'maybe', 'entitled', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Cruise', 'Vacation']",NAT'L  LAMPOONS CHRISTMAS VACATION 2 (DV

At how hey wait if they'd done this, will they do this - it'll be cliched and obvious but it'll work, then we can at least laugh... and nope, nope, nope they couldn't even do that.Okay so there is a smelly dog, so?

Well there is a monkey and hey he's smarter than our star.  I like monkeys they're cute.  Yeah, not funny.

I have it on DVD, and it is not christmas at my house until I've seen it at least 50 times (that's right). In fact, I could quote it until everybody who reads this is green in the face.But all this movie did was two things: take two hours of my life which I will never get back, and teach me that Cousin Eddie only works as a SUPPORTING CHARACTER. I should have spent last December 22nd watching the christmas lights flicker on and off. At least THAT'S amusing for a couple of seconds.The movie actually starts off with a couple of laughs. It almost misleads you into thinking this won't be so bad. But right around when they get shipwrecked on the island is when it starts to fall apart like a chinese motorcycle. From there on it is: too long, predictable, not funny, and did I mention it drags on too long? In case I didn't: IT DRAGS ON TOO LONG. We couldn't wait for it to end.Sorry, I really wanted to like it, but my whole family agreed that it's just lousy. There were barely any chuckles to be had. I still think they should do at least one more Vacation movie, however: STARRING CHEVY CHASE AND BEVERLY D'ANGELO!!!! (well, not if it's gonna be like this one was.)

But that doesn't mean it's not worth a few laughs. Just switch your brain off and enjoy an afternoon of stupidness.Cousin Eddie (the ever lovable Randy Quaid) is housesitting for Audrey (the totally sexy Dana Barron) during the Xmas holidays but loses his job at the Nuclear research plant to a chimp. Feeling down about how hopeless he is, Eddie is cheered up when the company offer his family and all expenses paid trip to Hawaii. So off they go (uncle Nick and Audrey too) for their dream Christmas Vacation. Obviously disaster is never too far away.This movie is basically pointless. The first was about Clark Griswald wishing to give his family the best Xmas ever. This 'un is just an excuse for a string of bad jokes with terrible comic timing. In this regard it's kinda similar to Vegas Vacation, the wit and sentiment of John Hughes is sorely missed.Quaid does his best, but there is a lot of not funnyness to it. He deserves better material, Matty Simmons may have produced all the other Vacation movies but he hasn't a clue how to write a good script. Christmas Vacation 2 is to the original what Home Alone 4 was to Home Alone.Plus I have a few questions, which I am sure a lot of other people will be asking. Why does Audrey's plumbing go mental? Why do Eddie's clothes stay impossibly white for the entire film? Why is there an elephant on the island?Plus there isn't that much of an Xmas feel to it. Sure the scenes in Chicago are quaint and snowy but a Hawaiian Island is hardly the best setting for a festive movie. However, Eddie does whistle and hum enough Xmas tunes to make up for it. But where the hell is the wonderful Christmas Vacation song?Buy if you're a fan of the first. Rent if you're only curious. It's nice to see a great character such as Cousin Eddie given the center spotlight but I just wish he was given funnier stuff to do.The DVD is in above average 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen with okay Dolby 2.0 surround that is mainly used for general ambience but still sounds fine whenever required.

All other factors; special effects, visual appeal, editing, stunts, and all the rest merely support the entertainment value. What really matters, once all is said and done, is whether the viewer was entertained.This film sucks like an Electrolux. The vacuum of space does not suck so compellingly as this movie! It is brutally bad!This film does not entertain. Nor does it come even close. It is a terrible film. It is absolutely awful. Humor, when any glimmer manifests at all, is strained and overdone. The smell of overcooked ham fills the air as actors cope with a horrifically boring script, idiotic dialog, overblown gags, witless peformances and a screenplay evidently written by chimpanzees. Perhaps it would have sparkled had it been written by chimps, because it certainly doesn't as it presently stands.I purchased the film on the strength of the first Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase, which was hilarious. This film was not hilarious, not even funny, not even remotely so. It was lame. More than lame, it was lame to a quantum 10th magnitude.This is a tragic performance for Randy Quaid, who has talent that is squandered on this tripe without mercy. I also expected much better from Ed Asner, who is simply wretched in this role.In the past, I have written reviews critical of bad films. This one absolutely surpasses them all for the ""worst film of all time"" nominations! This movie is as useless as a glass-bottomed boat in a sewage pond. As an example, much of the lame humor revolves around a flatulent dog. Funny, perhaps to very small children or patients on Thorazine, but lacking appeal to anybody with an IQ above double digit!Take it from somebody who wasted 15 bucks on this piece of video trash... DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS WORTHLESS PILE OF STEAMING COMPOST! Do not fritter your hard-earned money. Do not subject yourself, your loved ones nor your friends to this atrocious film.
