It's an enjoyable, well-written show, but I'm not just reviewing the series here.  I'm writing this to review the dvd.Time-wise, the shows are very inconsistent, which baffles me.  One show will be 19 minutes long, and the next will be 24 or 25.  It just doesn't make any sense.  Plus, I can't get over the fact that hour-long shows like 'Buffy' or the 'Law and Order' series have over 20 episodes in a season, and half-hour sitcoms like 'frasier' manage 22, but this particular &quot;half-hour&quot; show can only seem to muster 18.  With the seemingly endless possibilities for situations for the great characters that have been created to encounter, you'd think that they could give the audience just a little more.I really enjoy the show.

When I first saw the series oh so many years ago I couldn't get into it, so I gave it another try and was hooked.

There were friends of mine who just cackled about this show and swore it was great.  Did I agree?  No.The characters of ""Sex in the City"" for one are really shallow women.  They don't approach relationships in a mature fashion, they view men as sex objects rather than actual people (Mr. Big) and shopping seems to be the choice of relaxation (let alone martinis galore.)  I found myself kind of disgusted with their attitudes and lifestyles in general.  Not only can they not relate to the everyday woman in money and career ... but they come across like the friends I had that were bitter, nasty and shallow due to failed relationships -- remember those women I mentioned that liked this show?  That pretty much describes them.Maybe this type of show is to ""give it right back"" to guy shows that treat women like objects but honestly I'd rather watch something above that than something that degrades women in this fashion.So, what do I sum up?  Shallow show.  I know a number of ladies who can't stand this show either.  Kind of focuses on very immature women (sexually, socially and self-esteem to boot) who go through a very non-realistic lifestyle without a thought to  whom they sleep with. (Last I checked, no one really did this unless they were sleazy or hookers.)

Miranda develops a soft, warm relationship with Steve the bartender.  But just when you think our four favorite single gals might have it all figured out...the season finale throws everyone of them a curve ball!

Gone is Candace Bushnell's blue print of the book (except for the 20-something episode), so season two develops more of a story with each episode building on the next.  And some of the funniest scenes ever ... like Samantha's three way with a gay couple, Charlotte's class on tantric sex, and Carrie having to break up with a guy's mother (played by Valerie Harper).

Following the exploits of four young and educated female friends living and working in New York City, the show revolves around the various relationships and life problems experienced by each member of the group. Sporting an experienced and talented cast, the show has developed a strong, borderline fanatic following...Sarah Jessica Parker (the de facto lead character of the show) stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a popular sex columnist for a local newspaper who travels in numerous Manhattan social circles. Carrie is engaged in a tempestuous on-again, off-again relationship with a mystery man always referred to as ""Mr. Big"". The young urban professional shares her life with three best friends who have similarly interesting jobs - Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon), a lawyer tired of being single given the societal ramifications; Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), a promiscuous publicist who enjoys non-exclusive relationships; and Charlotte McDougal (Kristin Davis), an art museum curator who is relatively less open about her sexuality... Together, the women seek each other's advice on the ever-present and varying predicaments in which they find their romantic relationships...The Sex And The City (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" in which Carrie, having broken up with Mr. Big, starts dating a member of the New York Yankees. However, when they run into Mr. Big, she realizes she's not really over him. Meanwhile, Miranda is tired of her friends talking about nothing but men, and Samantha thinks she's found the man of her dreams - at least until she gets him in bed... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Four Women and a Funeral"" in which Carrie's reflections on the shortness of life following friend's death lead to a reunion with Mr. Big, and ""The Man, The Myth, The Viagra"" in which Carrie urges Mr. Big to get to know her friends better and Samantha dates a wealthy man in his seventies...Below is a list of episodes included on the Sex And The City (Season 2) DVD:Episode 13 (Take Me Out to the Ballgame)Episode 14 (The Awful Truth)Episode 15 (The Freak Show)Episode 16 (They Shoot Single People, Don't They?)Episode 17 (Four Women and a Funeral)Episode 18 (The Cheating Curve)Episode 19 (The Chicken Dance)Episode 20 (The Man, the Myth, the Viagra)Episode 21 (Old Dogs, New Dicks)Episode 22 (The Caste System)Episode 23 (Evolution)Episode 24 (La Douleur Exquise!)Episode 25 (Games People Play)Episode 26 (The F*ck Buddy)Episode 27 (Shortcomings)Episode 28 (Was It Good For You?)Episode 29 (Twenty-Something Girls vs. Thirty-Something Women)Episode 30 (Ex and the City)The DVD Report",5,One of the best original cable programs ever...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2856,"['Based', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'Candace', 'Bushnell', 'HBO', 'original', 'series', 'Sex', 'City', 'took', 'television', 'world', 'storm', 'following', 'release', 'summer', '1998', 'Following', 'exploits', 'four', 'young', 'educated', 'female', 'friends', 'living', 'working', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'show', 'various', 'relationships', 'life', 'problems', 'experienced', 'member', 'group', 'Sporting', 'experienced', 'talented', 'cast', 'show', 'developed', 'strong', 'borderline', 'fanatic', 'following', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'de', 'facto', 'lead', 'character', 'show', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'popular', 'sex', 'columnist', 'local', 'newspaper', 'who', 'numerous', 'Manhattan', 'social', 'circles', 'Carrie', 'engaged', 'tempestuous', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'relationship', 'mystery', 'man', 'always', 'referred', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'young', 'urban', 'professional', 'shares', 'life', 'three', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'similarly', 'interesting', 'jobs', 'Miranda', 'Hobbs', 'Cynthia', 'Nixon', 'lawyer', 'tired', 'being', 'single', 'given', 'societal', 'ramifications', 'Samantha', 'Jones', 'Kim', 'Cattrall', 'promiscuous', 'publicist', 'who', 'non-exclusive', 'relationships', 'Charlotte', 'McDougal', 'Kristin', 'Davis', 'art', 'museum', 'curator', 'who', 'relatively', 'less', 'open', 'sexuality', 'Together', 'women', 'seek', 'other', 'advice', 'ever-present', 'varying', 'predicaments', 'find', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'Sex', 'City', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Take', 'Me', 'Out', 'Ballgame', 'Carrie', 'having', 'broken', 'up', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'dating', 'member', 'New', 'York', 'Yankees', 'However', 'when', 'run', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'not', 'really', 'Meanwhile', 'Miranda', 'tired', 'friends', 'talking', 'nothing', 'men', 'Samantha', 'found', 'man', 'dreams', 'least', 'bed', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'include', 'Four', 'Women', 'Funeral', 'Carrie', 'reflections', 'shortness', 'life', 'following', 'friend', 'death', 'lead', 'reunion', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Man', 'Myth', 'Viagra', 'Carrie', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'get', 'know', 'friends', 'better', 'Samantha', 'wealthy', 'man', 'seventies', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Sex', 'City', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'Episode', '13', 'Take', 'Me', 'Out', 'Ballgame', 'Episode', '14', 'Awful', 'Truth', 'Episode', '15', 'Freak', 'Show', 'Episode', '16', 'Shoot', 'Single', 'People', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Episode', '17', 'Four', 'Women', 'Funeral', 'Episode', '18', 'Cheating', 'Curve', 'Episode', '19', 'Chicken', 'Dance', 'Episode', '20', 'Man', 'Myth', 'Viagra', 'Episode', '21', 'Old', 'Dogs', 'New', 'Dicks', 'Episode', '22', 'Caste', 'System', 'Episode', '23', 'Evolution', 'Episode', '24', 'La', 'Douleur', 'Exquise', 'Episode', '25', 'Games', 'People', 'Play', 'Episode', '26', 'F*ck', 'Buddy', 'Episode', '27', 'Shortcomings', 'Episode', '28', 'Good', 'Episode', '29', 'Twenty-Something', 'Girls', 'Thirty-Something', 'Women', 'Episode', '30', 'Ex', 'City', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

This season sets itself apart as the one that took the show into its irreverent direction.  While continuing to channel Ms. Bushnell's articles, the show expanded to become all about these four women.  They became real characters, not just vessels for the hilarious and odd that is NYC.  And this season has some great balance between all the characters.Every woman has her own storyline and incidents.  The best for each are (in my humble opinion):""The Cheating Curve"" Charlotte losses interest in men after a boyfriend cheats on her, in front of her!!  Enter the 'power lesbians!'""The Man, The Myth, The Viagra"" Samantha finds a very rich, but old, old man to treat her like a princess.  But how much is she willing to give up for decadent dates?""Evolution"" Poor Miranda just can't catch a break: she breaks up with Steve, she has to humiliatingly tell her gyno she no longer needs birth control, and then she finds out she has a 'lazy' ovary!  What's next?  A date with hair-plug guy?!?!""La Douleur Exquise"" Carrie realizes she is a masochist when Mr. Big hurts her again ... this time he is fleeing the country!  Her optimism and inability to see who Mr. Big for who he really is wrenches your heart, especially when Carrie does stop kidding herself.""Ex and the City"" Another Carrie episode, but the great group sing along and Samantha's embarrassing admission make this a perfect ladies episode.

579198,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,B00005AVCA,"""eurotrashgirl""","[65, 83]","At long last, the Second Season of Sex and the City is available for purchase!! Die-hard fans should expect more of the same: great writing &amp; acting, laugh out loud comedy, and cutting-edge fashion. As Season 3 showed us last year on HBO, this show just keeps getting better and better. The longer it is on the air, the more popular it gets!!Sex and the City is a breakthrough series about four single thirty-something women living and working in New York. Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, a witty, sarcastic and beautiful New York sex columnist who often looks to her own life and to that of her friends for her material. Her character is based on real-life writer Candace Bushnell, the Manhattan Sex Columnist who wrote the book upon which the show is based. The book was made up of a collection of actual columns that Bushnell had written for the New York Observer chronicling the '90's Manhattan social scene. Through the column, the book, and now the series, Bushnell take us on a tour of modern, thirty-something life in Manhattan, complete with roman a clef style observations of sexual escapades and scandals, and other society goings-on. The book proved Juicy material for a cable series, and the show has become a runaway hit!In addition to Parker's Carrie, there's Samantha, the beautiful, fun, (read, quite a bit more promiscuous than even the daring of us would ever be in real life!), and ever-so-spunky PR Executive. Confident, hilarious, and tough, her one-liners are a highlight of the show. Samantha is played by the &quot;grow on you till you absolutely love her&quot; Kim Cattrall. Then there's Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), the lawyer who some at her law firm, where she is trying to make Partner, think is gay. She's also very spunky, and adds another dimension to the four-tette of gals with her dry humour and sarcasm. Finally, there's Charlotte (Kristin Davis), the self-described husband hunter who is much more conservative than the other three, but who still loves men, and who can't wait to find her Mr. Right. The comedy and fun lies in watching her search, often in vain, for just that, in the available (and sometimes not-so-available) pool of Manhattan men!The show also features plenty of gorgeous, intriguing men, many of whom our protagonists get involved with. (Of course, as in life, many of these men are also neurotic, immature, emotionally unavailable, clingy, or mis-matched with the women. But this glimpse into the often-funny world of dating and the semi-strangeness which makes us all unique human beings is what keeps the show realistic, and truly hilarious! This is *not* a male-bashing show. The women themselves aren't perfect either, and they learn relationship lessons along the way too.)The most notable of the many suitors is the devilishly handsome and successful Mr. Big (Chris Noth). Big is Carrie's main love interest, and their relationship has lasted from early on in Season One, careening off into non-existence, and then building up speed and passion, meandering into tottering commitment, and all levels in between, in Season's 2 and 3. Just as he does Carrie, he will slay you with his charm, his smile, and his sexy bad boy power. He's Beautiful Eye Candy, and makes the show even more appealing for all of us girls! Season II sees the re-birth and sputtering new beginning of Big and Carrie's relationship, and will keep you glued to your seat to find out just what will happen next in their relationship.Because each episode is written and directed by various different writers and directors (including notable directors like Susan Seidelman), the show is never dull or stale. The show has won numerous Emmys for its writing, and Sarah Jessica Parker won an Emmy for her performance in the series as well.There is something in every episode to make you Laugh Out Loud. Carrie's facial expressions themselves (or her witty one-liners) can be enough sometimes to completely crack me up, (not to mention Samantha's risque, sarcastic comments, or Charlotte's wide-eyed good-girl retorts). This show is a great one to watch in a group, especially with a bunch of girl-friends who can relate to all the situations presented and just laugh their heads off!The fashion designers for the series (the Field sisters) have even started trends of their own with this show. For example, the big pin-on flowers that Carrie wears in the series have  been showing up on runways all over the world and in the latest Designers' Collections. When it comes to clothes, this show gives Britney Spears a run for her money! Carrie often appears wearing &quot;up to there&quot; shorts with tiny high heels, running around looking, to quote another song of the moment, &quot;so sexy, almost evil.&quot; On other days she might wear a skull t-shirt (while painting her apt for example), and on another, a really '80's looking get-up, complete with ultra-bright pastel-colored stripes. The one thing she never goes without though is her playboy bunny pendant, LOL. Between the great writing, skilled directing, in-your-face subject matter, and fashion, Sex and the City really is a trend-setter and an eye-opener in a lot of different ways.If you are going to buy the second season of Sex and the City, the DVD's the way to go, if possible. First of all, there's better picture quality, but the true greatness comes in not having to fast-forward to get to all your favorite episodes! Plus, the episodes on each disc (there are three discs total) are laid out clearly on a menu, complete with short descriptions and previews, if its been a while since you've had your 'Sex,' and you want to get right to the best bits!This is a must-see for all the women out there, and for the men, I think you will love  it just as much. It's impossible to watch only one episode, but I dare you to try. Good Luck!",5,"More?? Yes, More!!

They know me well, and others who run through the doors hoping one of the DVD's will be on the shelf.  I have stumbled, run and fell, and argued with another couple just to get the one DVD of the second season of ""Sex & the City"" that I had missed. No, they do not come conveniently packaged in one case, like the Amazon.com version.Let's face it folks, what we have here is the comic phenomenon of the new millenium.  Sarah Jessica Parker is riding the successs of HBO and doing it well.""Sex & the City"" is about Carrie Bradshaw (Parker) and her three friends (Cynthia Nixon, Kristen Davis, and Kim Catrall) who all live, work and make love in the Big Apple.  They are always up to something.  Sometimes it revolves around ""Twenty-Somethings vs. Thirty-Somethings"" or trying out different partners in bed (and their wierd quirks), and telling all.  It sounds a bit too risque, but I promise it really is just ""R"" rated.  With so many friends and so much of New York nightlife, Carrie spends her nights partying with the gals, finding the right lover, and over-analyzing the dating scene for her column, Sex & the City.  Some of the real boyfriends in the series are main characters themselves. Take ""Big"" for instance, Carrie meets him at a local club, and they begin a humorous, loving relationship. She calls him simply ""Big"" because he is wealthy and out of her league.  Carrie can't seem to give a name to anyone who isn't ready to commit.  I laughed so hard at one episode where Caririe is laying in Big's bed. While he reads, she accidentally ""passes gas"".  Carrie leaves and goes home humiliated and tells the girls. She believes the relationship will END just because of what she did.  The other girls share their stories of emabarrasing first-time mishaps..and so the episode continues.Sex & the City is not just for women. I can see a man finding all these female antics funny as well.Be cautioned, the content can sometimes vary from humorous and sexy to quite explicit.  But PLEASE do yourself a favor and BUY the DVD collection and forget the hassle of the video store.

At this point in the series the humor was still more anecdotal than character based; that is, if there was a funny sexually-oriented story, anecdote, or situation to be related, the writers threw it in, applying it to whatever girl seemed most convenient.  Later, as the characters' personalities and back stories developed, the writers were a little more careful about the types and variety of sexual adventures each girl experienced.  But the sexual craziness of the first couple of seasons is still entertaining, and certainly very funny.The various seasons of ""Sex and the City"" have really come down in price since their initial appearance on DVD, so now is a good time to see them for the first time, or in my case, to get re-acquainted with the show.

579210,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005AVCA,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","Now that ""Sex and the City"" has gone the way of all flesh, which in this case means sanitized syndication on conventional cable television, it is interesting to go back and find out that the second season was about more than the roller coaster relationship between Carrie and Mr. Big.  The other major development was that after dumping on Miranda for most of the season (and some things are worse than being dumped on, e.g., ""was it good for you?"") she finally meets up with Steve Brady.  Since Miranda ends up being my favorite character on the series, the point at which her life begins to turn around and heads for her unexpected happy ending is a key ""Sex and the City"" moment.But the focal point of ""Sex and the City: The Complete Second Season"" remains the attempts by Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) to various break up with Big (Chris Noth) and to make the relationship work.  She starts off the season trying to replace Big with a new member of the New York Yankees (""take me out to the ballgame""), but running into Big makes it clear she is not going to be over him and is never going to be over him.  After giving the relationship six months to die, she brings it back to life (""four women and a funeral"") and learns that the only thing worse than not dating Big is dating him, especially when she makes the mistake of saying ""I love you"" to him (""the caste system"").  I keep thinking that at some point he will catch on to the sense of desperation that he provokes in her, but it never seems to happen.  The Fates clearly think these two should be together, but apparently there is some sort of celestial alignment required that does not happen until the last possible moment in the show's six-year run.Of all of Carrie's boyfriends I liked Aidan (John Corbett) during the third season the best, although I realized from the start that wanting Carrie to stop smoking was a deal breaker.  But I appreciate the way Carrie's tango with Big represents one of the more complicated ongoing car crash relationships in television history.  If you had to put only one of these two on the couch to get them to answer questions and force them to confess what they think they are doing, I think it would have to be Big, but in my heart I think the writers just keep making him toss Carrie curve balls just to be her back on her heels.  Of course, the idea of Big going to Paris is interesting to reconsider given the series finale, but a symbol is a symbol.In the second season Charlotte (Kristin Davis) continues to have one bad date after another, culminating in the one where the guy falls asleep on her during sex (""was it good for you?""), which simply serves to set up the character's growing sense of desperation that will become fixated on Trey (Kyle MacLachlan) in season three.  My favorite Charlotte moment in season two is when she mingles with the ""powerful lesbians"" (""the cheating curve"").  Meanwhile, Samantha (Kim Cattrall) basically has a ""believe it or not"" type year of sexual encounters.  This is obvious when you consider that the problem she has with her lover in the first episode is the exact opposite of the complaint she has with the one in the finale episode of the season.  The gamut is rather obvious, but then Samantha's character is the one in the quartet that most resists any sort of continuing relationship, which is why turning Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis) into a deep and meaningful relationship during the final season was such a surprising and touching success.But when the focus is on how the second season sets up the end point of the series it is Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) who reaches the low point and does not really notice when she meets the man she is going to end up marrying in bartender Steve Brady (David Eigenberg).  I can see how her relationship with Skipper (Ben Webber) sets up what happens with Steve, but the key difference is that Steve really likes Miranda without turning into a sad little puppy dog.  I think the reason I like Miranda is that when she hits rock bottom and decides to stop dating (""the freak show""), she does so in relative silence (i.e., compared to Charlotte, whose suffering and successes are both fully voiced).  I understand that Miranda's cynicism exists primarily to show Carrie that no matter how bad things are she still has a way to go before she is at the edge of the cliff, but there is something painfully poignant about deciding to buy an apartment for yourself and plan on living the rest of your life alone (""four women and a funeral"").The language on ""Sex and the City"" never struck me as being unrealistic, although sometimes I think the ladies are saying these things a little louder at the coffee shop or wherever than I think they would in the real world.  But then I remember this is a television show and take that with a grain of salt, just as I do the idea that women usually make love while still wearing their bras.  However, since the language is so integral to the show, if the choice is between watching a sanitized version of ""Sex and the City"" or going with the DVD and the fully voice profanity, then I think you have to go with the latter.  Of course, this begs the question as to whether the language would bother you in the first place, but it will be the subject matter more than the language that I would expect some to find objectionable, which explains why the series was on HBO in the first place.",5,"Carrie and Big try, try again, and Miranda meets Steve",1105228800,"01 9, 2005",2005,5418,"['Now', 'Sex', 'City',

But as the Pres tells us....we must get on with our lives. Such is the wonderful parlance of watching SITC. You will indeed feel yourself remembering a NYC that was once the capital of the self-absorbed and hopelessly middleclass. Where a life perspective revolved around shoes, clothes, the latest designer nightlife and SEX.Sex and the City revolves around a group of central characters that you find yourself identifying with on many levels. You will remember or know people that are like this....or at least similiar in some respects. The situations that they get into can be completely inane and bizarre, but alas there is a perpetual ring of truth to a lot of the 4 womens exploits. Hence what makes the show work. The show succeeds by pulling back the shallow glitz image of 30 somethings aka: bad beer commercials and formulaic Sleepless in Seattle romance to deliver breathing characters with an astonishing sense of life and purpose. I find myself astonished at how on target the writers can get with certain issues and situations.There is so much bad writing in Hollywood nowadays, it's great to see the intellectual level of honesty and realism that this show delivers.I have both Season 1 and 2 disc sets and am waiting for the third season to arrive on disc.

Note, I'm not a feminazi here, not militant or extreme, as I don't have a problem with commitment, monogamy, or marriage...just a concerned woman eyeing the horizon for the future of womankind who sees a very poor one; full of little girls sleeping around (more younger and younger), valuing their virtue less and less as they don the whorish clothing we see in juniors sections around the world, flashing parts of their bodies on television claiming momentary loss of inhibition due to excessive alcohol consumption,selling off parts of their souls to settle down with anyone, and all the while making themselves out to be the second sex instead of an equal.Once again Big is in the picture vacillating between a pig and charmer, and Carrie is all too happy, like the little petulant masochist, to let him use her as a ahem....""dumpster"" and nothing more. What did she expect when they got back together? Roses and a ring? Moving in together? If you have to question the validity of a relationship and have to hide it from people, than honestly you don't have one. Depraved, pathetic, and fairly degrading to the female kind in general. Charlotte is still mousy and about as wholesome as you can be with this troop, though equally promiscuous. Carrie (as aforesaid) is pitiable and full of the same silly quotables/questions she uses to ""decode"" men...though how anyone can assume she's a master of relationship advice is beyond me. Miranda seems to be more career oriented, as her jaded relationship views (not all unwarranted) have poisoned her on the idea of a healthy one (though she manages to encounter at least one this season). And Samantha, oh Samantha, still getting herself into interesting situations and circumstances with her slew of partners while fighting stereotype, age, and society's puritanical viewpoints. This was one of my least favorite seasons overall because we continue to see the decline of Carrie, in what will be (later seasons) an unending dance with the man we know as Big in her life, who'll, for years to come, jerk her around like the clingy, miserable doll she is luring her back over and over, destroying not only hers, but other relationships in the process.Yes, it's entertaining to listen to the ladies as they lunch and gossip, sipping on their trendy cocktails, and accessorized in insanely overpriced ill looking clothing.  There's even a handsome diss cameo from Bon Jovi.

In this season, everybody's coming home late at night and jumping in folks' cars; having sex with someone different on every single episode (why do we pick on video girls when there are shows like this on the air?); and Miranda and Charlotte drove me insane. Miranda is that bitter, angry, no man friend that every male on Planet Earth can't stand because she's always the tightest friend with their girlfriend. She had some male bashing comment on just about every episode, but ironically, she couldn't WAIT to find a man and complained continuously about why nobody wanted her. Maybe because you're mean and annoying! Charlotte, on the other hand, bothered me more. I respect some of her old-fashioned ways about getting to know a man before having sex, and wanting to not use certain vocabulary words that are classless, but everything else about her made me want to scratch my eyes out. She was a complete hypocrite by lecturing people on being too slutty, but then she had sex with some guy at a wedding. That was a Samantha move! No matter what the guy does, she swears her dates are ""the one"" and talks about wanting to get married and have children more than even the old 80s sitcoms I'd see. If Charlotte's character met Mrs. Brady (from ""The Brady Bunch""), I think Mrs. Brady might ask her to loosen up a little.The first season was better because there was less vulgar humor and more actual slap-your-thigh funny scenes. This season had ""jokes"" like someone nutting on another person's forehead. Ugh.I hope the third season is better. If not, I'm going to start working with the last episodes and work my way to the bottom.",2,Video Girls on HBO,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,2144,"[""'d"", 'watched', 'season', 'first', ""'d"", 'have', 'never', 'gone', 'see', 'movie', 'watched', 'later', 'episodes', 'show', 'Fortunately', 'most', 'syndication', 'see', 'TV', 'are', 'Mr.', 'Big', 'Carrie', 'Samantha', 'Jared', 'Charlotte', 'Jewish', 'guy', 'Miranda', 'bartender', 'Call', 'prude', 'liked', 'later', 'episodes', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'woman', 'stuck', 'one', 'man', 'was', ""n't"", 'having', 'sex', 'first', 'date', 'guy', 'who', 'looked', 'cute', 'seemed', 'nice', 'seemed', 'be', 'slightly', 'more', 'street', 'smart', 'season', 'everybody', 'coming', 'home', 'late', 'night', 'jumping', 'folks', 'cars', 'having', 'sex', 'someone', 'different', 'single', 'episode', 'why', 'do', 'pick', 'video', 'girls', 'when', 'are', 'shows', 'air', 'Miranda', 'Charlotte', 'drove', 'insane', 'Miranda', 'bitter', 'angry', 'man', 'friend', 'male', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'always', 'tightest', 'friend', 'girlfriend', 'had', 'male', 'bashing', 'comment', 'just', 'episode', 'ironically', 'could', ""n't"", 'WAIT', 'find', 'man', 'complained', 'continuously', 'why', 'nobody', 'wanted', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'mean', 'annoying', 'Charlotte', 'other', 'hand', 'bothered', 'more', 'respect', 'old-fashioned', 'ways', 'getting', 'know', 'man', 'having', 'sex', 'wanting', 'not', 'use', 'certain', 'vocabulary', 'words', 'are', 'classless', 'everything', 'else', 'made', 'want', 'scratch', 'eyes', 'out', 'was', 'complete', 'hypocrite', 'lecturing', 'people', 'being', 'too', 'slutty', 'then', 'had', 'sex', 'guy', 'wedding', 'was', 'Samantha', 'move', 'matter', 'what', 'guy', 'dates', 'are', 'one', 'talks', 'wanting', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'children', 'more', 'even', 'old', '80s', 'sitcoms', ""'d"", 'see', 'Charlotte', 'character', 'met', 'Mrs.', 'Brady', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'think', 'Mrs.', 'Brady', 'might', 'ask', 'loosen', 'up', 'little.The', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'better', 'was', 'less', 'vulgar', 'humor', 'more', 'actual', 'slap-your-thigh', 'funny', 'scenes', 'season', 'had', 'jokes', 'someone', 'nutting', 'person', 'forehead', 'Ugh.I', 'hope', 'third', 'season', 'better', 'not', ""'m"", 'going', 'start', 'working', 'last', 'episodes', 'work', 'way', 'bottom']",N/A

Season 2 ran from June to October 1999 and spanned 18 episodes, as opposed to Season 1's 12.  By the time one reaches Season 2, you love the characters, you go into a trance when the charmingly surreal credits sequence comes on, and you need two hours to get back into the swing of everyday life when an episode finishes.  You're an addict.And what's not to love?  The cast is even better.  Cynthia Nixon's Miranda loosens up, and even develops a long-term relationship with super-cute bartender Steve (David Eigenberg).  Kristin Davis' Charlotte becomes even more obsessed with finding Mr. Right, but he's no where to be seen.  Samantha (Kim Cattrall) ... well, continues to sleep around.  Meanwhile, Carrie's (Sarah Jessica Parker) life is just as crazy as ever.  Still broken up over her - well, break up with Mr. Big (Chris Noth), Carrie tries to leap back in to the dating game to no avail.  However, a few close encounters of the Big kind and they're together again, a fact Carrie is first ashamed, then proud of.  Can they make it work the second time around?Throughout Season 2, Carrie continues to ask those questions that have haunted single women for years.  She's no longer as ""in control"" as she was during the first season, though.  Her breakup with Big has left her feeling vulnerable and lost.  Fortunately, she has three wonderful friends, and a team of witty, intelligent writers and directors to back her up as well.

I figured maybe since I'm a girl and girls like Sex in the City, just maybe I would like it too.Wrong. This series is pretty much a compilation of every modern female stereotype somehow moulded into a storyline. There are women talking on and on about shoes. There are awkwardly explicit and highly objectifying chats about sex. There are women freaking out for no apparent reason.This show is completely shallow and trivial. There is nothing deep underneath it all. The narration is annoying and often illogical, as is much of the dialogue.Though if you're the type who likes everything women stereotypically like (Cosmopolitan magazine, shopping, buying shoes, complaining about men, etc), you'll probably like this for whatever strange inexplicable reason everybody else does. But there's nothing intellectual, interesting or inventive about the series beyond that. It's no more interesting than the banal conversations you'd hear if you were eavesdropping on random girls at the mall.
