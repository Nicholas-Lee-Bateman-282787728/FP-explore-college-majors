She not only agrees to care for him temporarily, but begins her own search to find the child's mother (Laci Mailey) and solve the mystery of what extraordinary circumstances must have led this mother to abandon her child on the doorstep of a complete stranger.As the story unfolds, viewers discover that Peyton once gave her own child up for adoption, a decision that many years later still causes her shame. Peyton's sleuthing skills serve her well, and what she discovers is a young woman who's made some very tough decisions in impossible conditions.Peyton also discovers that she still has a personal yearning to be a mother, an idea that is initially unfathomable to her husband, who's more focused on a relaxing retirement in the not-too-distant future. As Peyton struggles with her conflicting desires to be a mother, do what's best for the infant, and help the child's mother, she not only dramatically changes the direction of the young mother's and child's lives, but of her own life and marriage. In this story of second chances, the real lessons learned are that there's always hope and that actions speak louder than words.",3,A Match Made In Heaven,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,1572,"['Reporter-turned-author', 'Peyton', 'MacGruder', 'Genie', 'Francis', 'new', 'husband', 'King', 'Danville', 'Ted', 'McGinley', 'return', 'screen', 'third', 'installment', 'films', 'based', 'Angela', 'Hunt', 'Note', 'novels', 'time', 'discover', 'infant', 'been', 'dropped', 'doorstep', 'simple', 'note', 'begging', 'care', 'child.Ever', 'compassionate', 'woman', 'Peyton', 'initial', 'reluctance', 'get', 'involved', 'infant', 'boy', 'not', 'only', 'care', 'temporarily', 'own', 'search', 'find', 'child', 'mother', 'Laci', 'Mailey', 'solve', 'mystery', 'what', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'must', 'have', 'led', 'mother', 'abandon', 'child', 'doorstep', 'complete', 'stranger.As', 'story', 'unfolds', 'viewers', 'discover', 'Peyton', 'once', 'gave', 'own', 'child', 'up', 'adoption', 'decision', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'shame', 'Peyton', 'sleuthing', 'skills', 'serve', 'well', 'what', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'made', 'very', 'tough', 'decisions', 'impossible', 'conditions.Peyton', 'also', 'still', 'personal', 'yearning', 'be', 'mother', 'idea', 'initially', 'unfathomable', 'husband', 'who', 'more', 'focused', 'relaxing', 'retirement', 'not-too-distant', 'future', 'Peyton', 'conflicting', 'desires', 'be', 'mother', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'infant', 'help', 'child', 'mother', 'not', 'only', 'dramatically', 'direction', 'young', 'mother', 'child', 'lives', 'own', 'life', 'marriage', 'story', 'second', 'chances', 'real', 'lessons', 'learned', 'are', 'always', 'hope', 'actions', 'speak', 'louder', 'words']",N/A
