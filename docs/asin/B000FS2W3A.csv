Cosentino,"[1, 6]","The fact that a group of supposedly intelligent professionals in the entertainment industry got together to make this ridiculous excuse for a film is unbelievable to me. A cop throws away his whole life with his wife (who's hot) and his son, and his career, for a hideously disfigured, retarded, psychopathic cannibal girl, because she has a good body? Any viewer who did not feel that their intelligence was severely insulted by this nonsense must be as retarded as the girl was. I mean, I wouldn't have brought her home in the first place, but after she ate the family cat, I'm pretty sure I would've kicked her ass to the curb. And not even chowing down on a little girl's innards was enough to turn this moron cop off to her. Truly absurd, ludicrous beyond anything I've ever seen before.

Now, Dario Argento has put the tale on film. I like the way Steven Weber fleshed out the story, and his Frank Spivey character is believably bewitched. As for JENIFER herself (itself?), she is a gruesome wonder. Although Wrightson's rendition was more bizarre (especially those hideously dead eyes!), the movie version is still suitably freakish. She goes about her merry business of enslaving the unwary Spivey, then destroying his life, while eating various animals, neighbors, etc. Of course, this is far more adult than the original comic, but that's to be expected.

Along with Pick Me Up and Incident on and off a Mountain Road, Jenifer has all the makings of a horror movie classic.  Although the movie is a *tad* predictable overall, throughout the course of the story there are many surprises around every corner.  Numerous horror conventions are pushed to the side to create a very original work.  Although Steven Weber would not have been my first choice to play the main character, I thought he did a commendable job in a difficult role, as he was forced to go progressively more insane as the story chugged along.  Carrie Anne Fleming is perfect as Jenifer.  She embodied the strange mixture of innocence and fearsomeness that the character exhibited throughout.  Although she really didn't have any lines, per se, she got everything else right.The gore and special effects were first rate, as they always are with Argento's work.  Nothing too over the top, but definitely enough to satiate even the most jaded of us gorehounds.All in all, Jenifer would make a great addition to your DVD/Horror collection.

The first scene of her violent depravities is somewhat shocking but it was done this way before many years ago & they use similar scenes too often.

This comic adaptation is a good example.Jenifer is lucky, it seems that every time a man realises how crazy she really is, another one is right there, just in time to save her and give her shelter. Then the whole pattern starts again! Sex, Cannibalism and moral disturbance until they get enough ... Sound a bit simple i know but its an awesome movie with all the right elements!I know some people are still shock about some of the scenes in the movie but again, thats the whole point to it!

Yet, he was repeatedly referred to as ""homeless"" and a ""derelict"". As the movie went on holes in the script annoyingly showed themselves. One minute Spivey is a police officer, the next he's unemployed and setting Jenifer up in an abandoned cabin in the woods. What?? I can say that the ending wasn't bad, all things considered.

994572,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B000FS2W3A,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[1, 1]","May Contain SpoilersJenifer tells the tale of a cop (Steven Weber) who manages to save a young woman from being savagely butchered by a mad man armed with a cleaver. The women in question is named Jenifer (Carrie Fleming) and she appears to be built from the neck down, like a sultry bombshell, her severely disfigured face on the other hand is anything but photogenic. It appears the title character is a hellish, sex-crazed, blood-thirsty succubus who manages to secure a firm hold over the affections of the men who come into close contact with her. Our cop hero's infatuation with her becomes obsessive causing his downward spiral and leading up to a climax that many including myself saw coming from the first five minutes.Although the story itself is predictable, very predictable, it still managed to hold my attention throughout as nudity, humor and gore abound and the film more than qualifies as an entry in the ""Masters of Horror"" series. I also liked that the origins of this She-Devil are never explained so the character remains an enigma and the viewer will be left with a lot of unanswered questions. Overall the performances from the lead actors are good which is somewhat surprising considering many entries in the series suffer greatly from bad to mediocre performances. Steven Weber's performance is solid throughout however in my opinion, Carrie Flemings performance stole the show. Although she has no spoken dialogue, she still manages to turn in a rather surprisingly effective vocal performance, she moans, groans, hisses, cries, growls, laughs, grunts etc all to good effect. She also manages to elicit some sympathy from the viewer and make the rather unpleasant title character sympathetic so kudos to her. What I also found interesting is that I being an Argento fan, would never have guessed he directed this film as it doesn't bear any resemblance to his earlier works with the exception of the musical score.""Jenifer"" is definitely one of the more solid entries in the ""Masters of Horror"" series, many of which are too quirky, comical and lacking in any real substance and suspense. This entry is quirky enough, predictable enough, ridiculous enough but the gore, sex and yuck inducing moments will have the more squeamish viewers heading straight for the shower after viewing.

Unfortunately, I'm left severely disappointed.The movie is gore-filled, with simple but good looking effects - Jenifer is certainly disturbing to see - but intestines and blood do not a scary movie make.  The acting is decent enough, but the part that kills the movie for me is the atmosphere, or more accurately, the lack of it.The colors, setting and music are all something that I would expect from an early ninties TV show on Sci-Fi, or even Nikelodeon.  Throughout the movie, I was imagining how much better each scene would have been with a much darker, nightmareish theme, more like Eraserhead, but not as frustratingly dull. Instead, we get cheesey, staccato orchestrations and arpeggiated synths with bright colors and predictable scenes, one after the other.I don't want to say it was bad.  I like the story alright, and yes, there is plenty of nudity (call me crass if you'd like, I'm not ashamed to admit it), but 13 Ghosts set a better mood than this movie... and that's scary.

In this world there are a lot of guys out there that's known a Jenifer. Not the lady on this disc that's mentally posses of some form or do you? What I do mean is that you find yourself with a extreme lady, and you just don't how you got trapped with her. No matter what, you just can't seem to get rid of her regardless how much she ruins everything, distance you from everybody you know and makes your life absolutely dejected. If you don't know what I mean consider yourself fortunate, although it's probably just a matter of time before you do. Exaggerated as this film may be there is a very real thread of something conceivable behind it all.There are a number of things that are off beam about this flick. Along with the drive-thru plot holes the acting is well....they speak.  In here we have a police officer Spivey, (Steven Weber), who stops a man from killing a woman (Carrie Fleming) with a meat cleaver. Spivey shoots the man, who utters one word before he dies: ""Jenifer."" The whimpering traumatized girl attaches herself to him, and she turns out to be some kind of demon. Weber somehow manages to check her out of the mental ward and take her to his house, the first instance of a serious plot hole in the film. There, Jenifer eats the family cat, causing Spivey's wife and son to leave. For no reason that I could discern, Spivey makes no apparent effort to get them back. Bad Jenifer!To me there was just something inherently wrong about this tale. Maybe it is the statement that men are all slaves to their genitals, but Jenifer's behavior is so reprehensible that we should laugh at Weber's slavish devotion to her, but we don't. Maybe it's because {the very beautiful} Carrie Anne Fleming's makeup is so grotesque with her dead eyes and slobbering, twisted mouth. But no, I've seen grosser. I can't exactly put my finger on it, and that is why this one is so unique. It does not explain itself. Jenifer just IS. You never find out where she's from, what her thought processes are, or why she's a raging cannibal. Again, because she just IS, plain and simple. She has no back-story, or secret trauma that tries to tug at our hearts and make us feel sorry for her. She is pure, unadulterated self-will run rampant. However, isn't that what all good horror monsters' really are? She eats when and what she wants has sex when she wants and generally does what she wants. She is everyone's inner id gone completely insane. As you can see, I have given this one a lot of thought, and could probably expand more, but all horror fans need to know is that Jenifer is okay but it will make you think.

I've long treasured Dario Argento's masterpieces like Suspiria, Inferno, Opera, Deep Red and others. I was so eager to watch this one I cancelled everything to push it into my DVD player and sit backa and--watched in disbelief. What lost me from nearly the beginning was how could a sharp policeman suddenly become obsessed with such a grotesque person as this girl with the most hideous looking face since Lon Chaney in Phantom of the Opera. Yes, she does have a good bod but how could a guy get aroused with her--and especially after he catches her gobbling up the family cat and then human beings. She doesn't just chomp down on them. She rips them apart, entrails and all, and dives right in. Yet, the cop keeps having wild sex with her even though she can't speak but only makes gurgling noises and whimpers. You're never shown why the cop is so obsessed with someone so horrific that she looks like she came from another planet. He brings her into his home where his wife--naturally--is horrified.  The cop keeps this female monster even after his family leaves him and he loses his job.  He drags Jenifer around like a treasured family pet. He does get a little upset when Jenifer attacks and starts dining on another human and then the cop does finally get pissed off and he starts to use his axe on her when--no, I won't give away the ending but it's pretty well expected.

The story starts with a police officer who sees a man try to kill a woman.  He shoots the man before he can cause harm.  The rescued woman is Jenifer.  She has a disfigured face, a killer body, and seems unable to talk.  But no sooner is the case open than the detective begins to become obsessed with Jenifer.  He visits her at an asylum and decides she needs compassion and friendship so he brings her home.  This causes new trouble.With Jenifer in the house things quickly fall apart for the detective's family life.  Then he discovers that Jenifer has a very active libido and has targeted him.  Then more of Jenifer's nature becomes apparent as she eats the family dog.  Things continue to go downhill as the detective is both repulsed by Jenifer's behavior and enslaved to her passion.  The downward spiral continues until the inevitable ending.This is one of the best of the Master Of Horror series and may be the best of them all.  The story is dark and disturbing.  It is missing the cuteness that ruined some of the others in the series.  The script is true to the original except the detective is given a happier home life so that he call fall even further during the story.  There is a large amount of nudity and sexuality in this film.  Had this been a theatrical release there would probably have been talk of an NC-17 rating for a couple of the scenes.

994590,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000FS2W3A,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 3]","Dario Argento, Italian master of filmic suspense and artfully choreographed horror, took the helm for this weird and wonky installment of Showtime's ""Masters of Horror"" series.The tight little teleplay (which does a lot with an economy of dialogue) was written by Steven Weber, who also plays our lead, officer Frank Spivey.  In the first five minutes of the show, Frank kills a fly with a newspaper and then kills a crazy-eyed businessman with a bullet.  You can't blame Frank; the businessman had a butcher knife and was about to go all Dahmer on a poor whimpering blonde girl.  (I'm not sure what implicated the fly; after all, it was only doing what flies do ... maybe that's important, or maybe I'm reading too much into it.)The blonde girl turns out to be horribly disfigured and incapable of normal human communication.  A piece of paper found on the businessman's body says, simply, ""Jenifer.""  Feeling in some way responsible for this malformed girl (and drawn to the milky curves of her body in spite of her ""Butter"" face), Frank takes Jenifer into his home.  This bothers his wife and son, especially after Jenifer turns their pet cat into dinner.Yes!  Jenifer is a horrifying she-beast!  Or, actually, she's just a primitive version of anyone else: her primary goals are to eat and mate, eat and mate, and that is essentially this film.  It just so turns out that Frank, subsumed by both guilt and lust, lets Jenifer drag him down into her primally satisfying (and disturbing) world.  He offers up a modicum of protest (Oh no! Jenifer killed again! That nutty Jenifer!), but one gets the feeling that it's only for show.  Weber does a good job of portraying a man who's sanity is succumbing to Id-like destruction, but the flick flags because of the pacing and the all-too-predictable ending.  There's only so many times that the Sex-N-Kill, Sex-N-Kill algorithm can loop before it loses all meaning, or at least all intrigue and suspense.****NIT-PICK ALERT****I had to say this: no one else has.Jenifer, essentially, seduces Frank.  He drives her to the bay to dump her off in the woods, long before she's taken over his life.  This is where she first makes a pass at him, and they make sweet mutant love in his car.  What's my nit-pick?  Thanks for asking; I'll tell you.Frank initially repels her advances, but she finally sways him with what, as far as the filming shows us, is amazing oral sex (some of this scene had to be deleted to make it on air -- a first for the series; the excised portions are on the DVD).  My problem is that Jenifer's abnormalities would make, I imagine, for a very painful bout of fellatio.  That is, her mouth is frozen in this teeth-bared rictus; she is incapable of closing her lips together.  I'll accept that Jenifer is strong and violent and loves raw meat; but I refuse to accept that she's good at giving ... uh ... that.Like I said, a bit of a nit-pick.

994591,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B000FS2W3A,Matthew King,"[2, 4]","Dario Argento, master of the Italian ""Gialli"" and one of the most celebrated horror directors of all-time, needs little introduction to the well-versed horror fan.  Early in his career, he delivered classic film after classic film, too numerous to mention but some of them include ""Deep Red"", ""Suspiria"", ""Phenomena"", ""Tenebre"" and the list goes on.  Unfortunately, the last 15 years have not been so kind, as he has been mired in a bit of a slump.  Every film since the decent ""Trauma"" (1993) has been somewhat lackluster, with the low point of his career being 1998's atrocious ""Phantom of the Opera"".  But I digress.  His works throughout the 70's and 80's are gold and we will always treasure his cinematic output of that era.  While ""Jennifer"" can hardly be considered a return to form, as some reviewers have dubbed it, it is a decent piece nonetheless.Writer/actor Steven Weber stars as weary cop Frank Spivey, whose life and sanity are destroyed by a fateful encounter with a young girl.  Frank interrupts what appears to be a murder-in-progress: a crazed maniac wielding a meat cleaver over a bound, helplessly cowering female figure.  Frank has just rescued ""Jennifer"", a mute girl with a killer body but who has a horrifyingly deformed face.  Confused by simultaneous feelings of repulsion and sympathy that course through him, Frank takes the girl into his house once he discovers that she's homeless.  He has fallen under Jennifer's morbid spell, as the girl systematically destroys his will, his sanity, his family, and his life.While ""Jennifer"" cannot be considered terrible, I would still have to rank it as one of the lesser episodes of the strong first season of ""Masters of Horror"".  It has the thinnest and most predictable plot of the episodes I've seen, as the ending can be spotted a mile away.  However, this is somewhat compensated by the generous amounts of graphic sex, violence and pure perversion.  The sex sequences are amazingly filmed, since they combine feelings of both excitement and disgust.  It has some exploitation elements euro-horror fans will adore.Jennifer herself is a study of contrasts; she has a stunning body but her face is hideously deformed.  She genuinely appears to be a pathetic, withdrawn creature who just wants to be loved yet her ravenous appetite for flesh makes her evil incarnate.  As a viewer, we're not quite sure if we're meant to sympathize with her or to loathe her.Maybe this episode was not all that it could have been since it was not written by Argento, but by Weber.  Or maybe Argento's time as one of the premier horror directors has long passed and his output from now on will likely never surpass the ""decent"" threshold.

Although some of Argento's trademarks from his earlier movies are here, the excellent camera work, the creepy children's music, and bugs flying around, this piece further goes to show that Argento is losing his touch as the story drags on and doesn't offer much to the viewer save for token scenes of cannibalism, sex and gore.

Grant ""MacGyver of the Books""","[16, 53]","While I have not seen or purchased the DVD of Jennifer (Showtime's Masters of Horror), I did have the UNfortunate chance to watch the episode when it originally aired.It's lousy.Jennifer tells the tale of a police officer who saves a facially disfigured girl and then develops a strange bond with her.  This bond becomes physical, sexual, and leads to the destruction of many avenues in the police officer's life.I have so many problems with this story that I don't know where to begin.  First, it's not scary.  Second, the ""twist"" ending can be spotted within the first 5 minutes by anyone with an IQ higher than Forrest Gump.  Third, none of the characters relate to each other so there is no sense of shock or loss at the odd choices the main police officer makes.  Fourth, Steven Webber, who is a decent TV actor, is a crappy writer and clearly bit off more than he could chew with this story.  Fifth, Jennifer herself is absolutely revolting...gross out horror is the lowest denominator of the genre.Now I realize that the Horror genre is probably the hardest for viewers to personalize.  One man's Jaws is another man's Jaws: The Revenge, but I'd find it hard to believe that anyone would find it worth their time to want to own or repeatedly view the mess that is Jennifer.

994594,A3V2THQU2RQ1AG,B000FS2W3A,Molly C.,"[8, 8]","After police officer Frank Spivey saves a disfigured young woman named Jenifer from being killed, he takes her into his home and begins a dangerous love affair with her. (Okay, so I know this has been reviewed a million times over, but I will address issues not previously covered by others.) When Frank later returns home after killing a man and saving Jenifer, he is seduced by his wife. At first, her advances turn him off, but then he is plagued with flashbacks of the dying man and a helpless tied up Jenifer. This makes Frank become sexually charged and aggressive towards his wife. In an ambiguous move on the director's part, it appears as though he rapes his own wife. Later, you will find him sinking to new lows with devastating consequences.I could not help but notice the many similarities to David Cronenberg's Crash. There is an emphasis on the weird attraction we may feel towards some things that should repulse us. The nude & sex scenes show a heavy contrast between what is beautiful and what is disgusting and as it turns out, there is a thin line between the two.I have read some other reviewer's opinions and they seem to state that their interpretation of Jenifer is as a monster or severely disfigured woman. Some even called her an ""alien"". My personal opinion is that she is none of the above. I think that would be missing the point of the film. I believe that Jenifer is not a human, but rather a manifestation of man's desire. Inevitably, all the men lose their wives, children, jobs, freedom, and eventually their lives. It is a cautionary tale to all stupid men, uh, well, I guess all men. The good news is that Frank pays for his stupidity in the end. Actually, things come around full circle. And I have to admit, I laughed.Like a typical Argento film, he covers much ground here. Besides the obvious comparison to ugly and beauty, he takes a look at a corrupt police force. When the man that attempted to kill Jenifer has his nice clothes searched, but found missing an ID, he is written off as a homeless person. It later turns out that he was wealthy. When Jenifer is rescued, she is considered retarded and admitted to a mental institution because ""that's the system"".While the story itself is great and tackles bizarre subject matter, my biggest complaint is that the nudity goes way overboard. I got the point about 5 nude scenes in. I don't need a paint by numbers cheap porno where the partners switch positions repeatedly. Top, bottom, side, car, bed, cabin, etc. It got very boring, very quickly. Plus half the time the nudity made no sense at all. For instance, if Jenifer is showering in an institute, Why is a male orderly and a male stranger allowed in there to gawk at her? Why is Jenifer walking around naked at Frank's house in front of his wife and young son and no one bothers to cover her? Another thing that didn't make a lot of sense was when Frank quits his job to live in the woods with Jenifer. Why not just hide her there and visit? Okay, to keep an eye on her and bone repeatedly. Fine. But wouldn't his wife and son report him missing? Um, there is such a thing as child support. He cannot just run off with another broad and not expect people to come for him.Clocking in at a full 58 minutes, the film features great SFX (and in case you missed it, nekkid people). Claudio from Goblin supplies the soundtrack.Weird Fact: This was the only Season 1 episode to require cuts. 2 shots were removed involving graphic depictions of oral sex. The first one occurred during the awkward sex scene in the car and the second occurred at the end of the film. The deleted scenes are edited into the 'So Hideous My Love' documentary on the DVD, which somehow I completely missed. Uhh, I guess I don't know oral sex when I see it. Or maybe I accidentally skipped over this. Or I got tired of watching this and did something else.Favorite Quote: Police Chief, ""If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck with a meat cleaver.""

Steven Weber plays a detective named Spivey who saves the title character (Carrie Fleming), who just so happens to be a disfigured girl.  He takes her in to live with him and his family, which leads to Jenifer's devouring of the family cat, the family departing, and Spivey becoming increasingly seduced by the mysterious, vivacious, and incredibly hungry, Jenifer.  While Argento's stylistic direction is undoubtedly the best part of Jenifer, what really hurts the episode is the adaptation by Weber himself.  Plot holes and leaps in logic are abound, which will undoubtedly leave you scratching your head at what develops.  What does develop is so incredibly predictable that you'll know how it ends before the credits roll, but it's Argento's touch that still makes Jenifer worth checking out.

994598,AQ2UN38CMK119,B000FS2W3A,P. Mann,"[24, 34]","This entry into the ""Masters of Horror"" series is, by far, the worst I have seen (of about six or seven of them), a true disaster of a film. Or so I thought until I came here and saw the glowing reviews of so many other people. I am at a loss to understand what they could have seen in the film, so I'll try to explain my reaction and hope that those who read this review will read the more positive reviews and see which seem more in accord with their tastes.First, the plot. Spivey, a police officer (Steven Weber) stops a man from killing a woman (Carrie Fleming) with a meat cleaver. Spivey shoots the man, who utters one word before he dies: ""Jenifer."" The woman turns out to be a deformed woman about whom nothing is known. Weber somehow manages to check her out of the mental ward and take her to his house, the first instance of a serious plot hole in the film. There, Jenifer eats the family cat, causing Spivey's wife and son to leave. For no reason that I could discern, Spivey makes no apparent effort to get them back.What Spivey does get out of his relationship with Jenifer is a lot of sex. Why he would want to engage in sex with someone with cat breath is not clear. Jenifer has, it seems, some sort of hold over him, a hold that begins the moment he meets her. He does try to break free eventually, leading to an ending so predictable that it is obvious long before it unfolds.In trying to reconcile the positive reviews of this film with my own reactions, I have gone over the film again in my mind and tried to figure out what there is to recommend it. The film is shot well, but the cinematography is not spectacular or even especially noteworthy, especially when compared to some of Dario Argento's earlier, better-known work (thinkSuspiria). The acting is competent, but the characters are so flat that there is little either principal actor can do with his or her role. Weber, for instance, never fully conveys why his character would choose Jenifer over his family, and Fleming is even more limited since her character does not speak. Indeed, Jenifer seems only to growl, eat, whimper, and have a lot of sex.

994601,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000FS2W3A,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 2]","Masters of Horror: Jenifer (Dario Argento, 2005)Dario Argento has made some deeply, deeply twisted movies over the years. I've loved most, if not all, of them. Most are just plain fun. Some are disturbing in that kind of ""ooh, wouldn't that be creepy if it were really happening?"" way. Argento distances the viewer from the creep factor most of the time with his operatic method of directing.Then came Jenifer, where Dario Argento switches gears and comes up with, hands down, the most disturbing, brutal, ugly, misogynist, hateful, offensive, disgusting, haunting, realistic, scary, thrilling, absorbing film of his career, his most beautiful since Suspiria and his most brilliant since Profondo Rosso. (As a side note, it also makes me wonder: if they actually showed this one on television, what on Earth did Takashi Miike do that caused them to yank Imprint?) This short film will knock you out of your chair and send you sprawling across the floor with a bloody lip and a sense of moral outrage, but you'll still not be able to tear your eyes away, and in the end you'll fall in love with it. Because you have no choice. Once it sinks its hooks into you, it will not let go.Frank Spivey (Steven Weber, recently of The Shining) is a cop who interrupts an attempted murder-- a crazed man (The New Beachcombers' Kevin Crofton) is about to hack up a girl with a meatcleaver. Spivey kills him, and when he goes to rescue the girl, Jenifer (The Tooth Fairy's Carrie Anne Fleming), he finds her face horribly disfigured, yet the rest of her is perfect. Spivey, caught in the throes of a combination of lust, revulsion, and sympathy, starts to realize that Jenifer is, perhaps, not the innocent victim he thought-- but by that time, it's too late.If there is one word that can be used to describe Jenifer, it is ""explicit."" (In fact, two scenes were cut from the final print; both can be seen in the DVD extras, and they are without doubt the most explicit things I've seen in a non-X-rated film.) The movie (for Argento tells us he did not approach this as an episode of a TV series, but as a short film, and that's how it comes off) is awash in both sex and violence, and in a way that's more aggressive than in most of Argento's work. (That's saying something.) But if that were all there were to this movie, it would be just another exploitation flick pushing the knife in. What twists it up into your guts is Jenifer herself (for those reading this on Amazon, where italics aren't allowed, above I was talking about Jenifer the movie; here I'm talking about Jenifer the character). Jenifer is a nasty piece of work, to be sure, but there's never any indication that she's malicious; she does the things she does out of far more primal emotions-- love, loyalty, jealousy, curiosity, confusion, hunger. She does what she's been taught. In her way, Jenifer (the character) is the distillation of the collective intelligence and will of every zombie in Romero's Dead quartet; she is, in some primitive form, us. And that's what will make you recoil in disgust and keep you riveted at the same time. **** ",4,Supremely disturbing.,1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,3102,"['Masters', 'Horror', 'Jenifer', 'Dario', 'Argento', '2005', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'made', 'deeply', 'deeply', 'twisted', 'movies', 'years', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'most', 'not', 'Most', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'are', 'disturbing', 'kind', 'ooh', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'creepy', 'were', 'really', 'happening', 'way', 'Argento', 'viewer', 'creep', 'factor', 'most', 'time', 'operatic', 'method', 'directing.Then', 'came', 'Jenifer', 'where', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'gears', 'up', 'hands', 'down', 'most', 'disturbing', 'brutal', 'ugly', 'misogynist', 'hateful', 'offensive', 'disgusting', 'haunting', 'realistic', 'scary', 'thrilling', 'absorbing', 'film', 'career', 'most', 'beautiful', 'Suspiria', 'most', 'brilliant', 'Profondo', 'Rosso', 'side', 'note', 'also', 'wonder', 'actually', 'showed', 'one', 'television', 'what', 'Earth', 'did', 'Takashi', 'Miike', 'do', 'caused', 'yank', 'Imprint', 'short', 'film', 'will', 'knock', 'chair', 'send', 'sprawling', 'floor', 'bloody', 'lip', 'sense', 'moral', 'outrage', ""'ll"", 'still', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'tear', 'eyes', 'away', 'end', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'love', 'have', 'choice', 'hooks', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'go.Frank', 'Spivey', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'recently', 'Shining', 'cop', 'who', 'attempted', 'murder', 'crazed', 'man', 'New', 'Beachcombers', 'Kevin', 'Crofton', 'hack', 'up', 'girl', 'meatcleaver', 'Spivey', 'when', 'rescue', 'girl', 'Jenifer', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'Carrie', 'Anne', 'Fleming', 'face', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'rest', 'perfect', 'Spivey', 'caught', 'throes', 'combination', 'lust', 'revulsion', 'sympathy', 'realize', 'Jenifer', 'perhaps', 'not', 'innocent', 'victim', 'thought', 'time', 'too', 'late.If', 'one', 'word', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'describe', 'Jenifer', 'explicit', 'fact', 'two', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'final', 'print', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'doubt', 'most', 'explicit', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'non-X-rated', 'film', 'movie', 'Argento', 'did', 'not', 'approach', 'episode', 'TV', 'series', 'short', 'film', 'how', 'off', 'awash', 'sex', 'violence', 'way', 'more', 'aggressive', 'most', 'Argento', 'work', 'saying', 'something', 'were', 'were', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'pushing', 'knife', 'What', 'up', 'guts', 'Jenifer', 'reading', 'Amazon', 'where', 'italics', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'was', 'talking', 'Jenifer', 'movie', 'here', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Jenifer', 'character', 'Jenifer', 'nasty', 'piece', 'work', 'be', 'sure', 'never', 'indication', 'malicious', 'things', 'far', 'more', 'primal', 'emotions', 'love', 'loyalty', 'jealousy', 'curiosity', 'confusion', 'hunger', 'what', 'been', 'taught', 'way', 'Jenifer', 'character', 'distillation', 'collective', 'intelligence', 'will', 'zombie', 'Romero', 'Dead', 'quartet', 'primitive', 'form', 'what', 'will', 'make', 'recoil', 'disgust', 'keep', 'riveted', 'same', 'time', '****']",Masters of Horror - Dario Argento - Jenifer

Actually, if you try to take her, she might just take you instead.  Here we have this mysterious person as beautiful as she is hideous who has no past and no identity save for the name Jennifer, which she doesn't even acknowledge--it is the men who find her that endow her with that name.  There is even the potential for a good theme:  sex and violence are arguably one side of the same coin (ie. Jennifer and the boy in the cellar); what exactly does it mean to be perverted if you`re not wearing a raincoat and hanging out at the schoolyard.  Unfortunately what we get instead is too much of the sex and violence, not enough story and the lingering question:  have we all been taken?  Now, I'm as much of a gore monger as you who are reading this probably are also, but on that same note, I don't like to have my intelligence insulted by self-lobotomizing stories whose plot resolution can be seen from a mile away.  Despite the caption on the back of the DVD case, the story wasn't also all that particularly funny either, unless watching an incredibly hot ugly babe having it on repeatedly with the cop who saved her is your idea of a good guffaw.  Add to that a major plot hole--are we truly expected to believe that the police officer who found her didn't investigate the crime scene area, or that the same will be done at the story's end???-- the size of the Arizona meteor crater and you have a mess of an episode.  The good points:  Carrie Anne Fleming-she did a fine job getting across some of the more subtler qualities of our creature without saying a single word in the process; the special make-up effects were eye-popping, especially with the Jennifer character.  The, ah . . . opportunities for development:  the story-Argento has directed some of the finest giallo films in the genre, but this was as suspenseful as watching grass grow; the gore-now, don't take this the wrong way!--despite the fact that Argento had a significant hand in the development of Dawn of the Dead, one of the most ballsout goriest movies of all time, this kind of lingering gore (Jennifer feeding) just isn't his style, as he's tended to focus more on the act of violence itself, as opposed to its after effects.  Dario Argento was and is one of the most important horror directors of our time whose recognition stateside has been long overdue.

He shoots the baddie and rescues the girl, who has a gorgeous body but a hideously disfigured face.  Her name is Jenifer.  (They know this because the name was on a note in the dead man's pocket.)  It seems Jenifer can't speak and can't be identified, so she is put into an asylum.  Not wanting to leave her to this fate, Frank brings the clearly feral woman home to stay with him and his family.Great idea.Even after Jenifer assaults his wife, eats the cat, and later does the same to the little girl from next door, Frank insists on keeping her in his care.  His perfectly good-looking, non-cannibalistic wife flees with their son.  (Early scenes hint at some marital problems, but really, after what Jenifer puts him through, any troubles he and his wife could possibly have had seem trivial by comparison.  Jenifer can't be that good in bed.  Or in the car.  Or wherever.  If she has some kind of ""spell"" over Frank, it doesn't show in either the writing or the acting.

Yes her face is hidious, but she has a great body. Guess it's true what they say that a man will do anything. Jenifer seduces a cop and he falls in to her trap.

994605,A1KVBBRXQ2PWJ7,B000FS2W3A,Siklootd,"[2, 2]","The ""Masters of Horror"" films have always been quite interesting to view.  Despite their short run time of 50 odd minutes each, many of these films actually contain more action and storyline/plot development than most full length films.  ""Jenifer"" is no exception.  The film manages to provide scenes of gore, and total brutality while still completely developing the eerie plot that's full of twists and turns at every possible chance that the film is presented with.Directed by Dario Argento, the mastermind behind classics such as ""Suspiria"", ""Inferno"", and many other outstanding, timeless horror films, ""Jenifer"" is one of his best titles to date and is a great addition to his already stellar catalog of films.  ""Jenifer"" begins by depicting a team of officers enjoying a delectable lunch in their police vehicle.  Suddenly, Frank Spivey's lunch is interrupted when he witnesses a man dragging a young woman and attempting to decapitate the girl.  Frank warns the man to cease in his actions, but the man refuses, simply stating ""You don't know what she is"" while proceeding to raise his weapon.  Frank is left with no option other than to shoot the man.  The only thing the man says before dying is ""Jenifer"".Down at the station, no one is capable of gathering any information in regards to the young lady who Frank saved.  The only information they have lies within a note the man had in his pocket that simply read ""Jenifer"".  Jenifer appears normal when the viewer is only capable of seeing her body, a very fine toned, slender, attractive body; however Jenifer is not normal at all.  All of the officers are shocked by Jenifer's appearance, stating that the girl must be deformed and mentally impaired, seeing how she is not capable of speaking and relies on simple grunts to communicate.  Jenifer's face consists of two large, solid black eyes and an extremely large mouth full of rather large fangs.Frank becomes distracted and obsessed with Jenifer.  Unable to focus even while making love to his beautiful wife, Frank consistently pictures Jenifer in his mind, and fantasizes about her even when he's with his wife.  Upon discovering that Jenifer has been sent to a local asylum, Frank decides it would be better for her if he pulled her out and allowed Jenifer to live with him and his family.  It is here that things begin to take a turn for the worst.Jenifer begins to grow violent, turning on the family's cat, forcing Frank's wife to leave him.  Jenifer's behavior begins to escalate out of control.  Dead bodies begin to show up at every turn, yet Frank cannot find the courage to leave Jenifer.  Her hunger for physical attention fills Frank with uncontrollable lust, and his cravings for her body outweigh his fears of what Jenifer has become.Graphic, gory, and very sexual, ""Jenifer"" is a film that is capable of truly captivating the audience, especially anyone who happens to be a fan of horror films in general.  The story line is very good, especially for an hour long viewing experience, and the plot slowly shows the evil nature that lies within Jenifer and her libido that is capable of seducing men and leaving them helpless to watch her violent actions as they occur right before their eyes.  Dario Argento has created a dark, sexual film, that brings forth everything that a horror fan wants from a movie: blood, guts, sex, nudity, and a well played out plot.  The film never contains any unnecessary scenes, and all of the violence and sex does a great job of contributing to the overall story rather than simply being in the film without any actual purpose.  Anyone who's looking for a short, but spectacular film to view, any of the ""Masters of Horror"" films will work just fine, but ""Jenifer"" is a true stand out amongst its peers.",5,"Dark, Violent, Creepy, and Sexual",1282003200,"08 17, 2010",2010,3769,"['Masters', 'Horror', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'quite', 'interesting', 'view', 'short', 'run', 'time', '50', 'odd', 'minutes', 'many', 'films', 'actually', 'contain', 'more', 'action', 'storyline/plot', 'development', 'most', 'full', 'length', 'films', 'Jenifer', 'exception', 'film', 'provide', 'scenes', 'gore', 'total', 'brutality', 'still', 'completely', 'developing', 'eerie', 'plot', 'full', 'twists', 'turns', 'possible', 'chance', 'film', 'presented', 'with.Directed', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'mastermind', 'classics', 'such', 'Suspiria', 'Inferno', 'many', 'other', 'outstanding', 'timeless', 'horror', 'films', 'Jenifer', 'one', 'best', 'titles', 'date', 'great', 'addition', 'already', 'stellar', 'catalog', 'films', 'Jenifer', 'depicting', 'team', 'officers', 'enjoying', 'delectable', 'lunch', 'police', 'vehicle', 'Suddenly', 'Frank', 'Spivey', 'lunch', 'interrupted', 'when', 'man', 'dragging', 'young', 'woman', 'attempting', 'decapitate', 'girl', 'Frank', 'man', 'cease', 'actions', 'man', 'simply', 'stating', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'proceeding', 'raise', 'weapon', 'Frank', 'left', 'option', 'other', 'shoot', 'man', 'only', 'thing', 'man', 'dying', 'Jenifer', '.Down', 'station', 'one', 'capable', 'gathering', 'information', 'regards', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'Frank', 'saved', 'only', 'information', 'have', 'lies', 'note', 'man', 'had', 'pocket', 'simply', 'read', 'Jenifer', 'Jenifer', 'normal', 'when', 'viewer', 'only', 'capable', 'seeing', 'body', 'very', 'fine', 'toned', 'slender', 'attractive', 'body', 'however', 'Jenifer', 'not', 'normal', 'officers', 'are', 'shocked', 'Jenifer', 'appearance', 'stating', 'girl', 'must', 'be', 'deformed', 'mentally', 'impaired', 'seeing', 'how', 'not', 'capable', 'speaking', 'relies', 'simple', 'grunts', 'communicate', 'Jenifer', 'face', 'two', 'large', 'solid', 'black', 'eyes', 'extremely', 'large', 'full', 'rather', 'large', 'fangs.Frank', 'becomes', 'distracted', 'obsessed', 'Jenifer', 'Unable', 'focus', 'even', 'making', 'love', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Frank', 'consistently', 'Jenifer', 'mind', 'even', 'when', 'wife', 'discovering', 'Jenifer', 'been', 'sent', 'local', 'asylum', 'Frank', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'pulled', 'out', 'allowed', 'Jenifer', 'live', 'family', 'here', 'things', 'begin', 'take', 'turn', 'worst.Jenifer', 'grow', 'violent', 'turning', 'family', 'cat', 'forcing', 'Frank', 'wife', 'leave', 'Jenifer', 'behavior', 'escalate', 'control', 'Dead', 'bodies', 'begin', 'show', 'up', 'turn', 'yet', 'Frank', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'courage', 'leave', 'Jenifer', 'hunger', 'physical', 'attention', 'fills', 'Frank', 'uncontrollable', 'lust', 'cravings', 'body', 'outweigh', 'fears', 'what', 'Jenifer', 'become.Graphic', 'gory', 'very', 'sexual', 'Jenifer', 'film', 'capable', 'truly', 'captivating', 'audience', 'especially', 'anyone', 'who', 'be', 'fan', 'horror', 'films', 'general', 'story', 'line', 'very', 'good', 'especially', 'hour', 'long', 'viewing', 'experience', 'plot', 'slowly', 'evil', 'nature', 'Jenifer', 'libido', 'capable', 'seducing', 'men', 'leaving', 'helpless', 'watch', 'violent', 'actions', 'occur', 'right', 'eyes', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'created', 'dark', 'sexual', 'film', 'forth', 'everything', 'horror', 'fan', 'movie', 'blood', 'guts', 'sex', 'nudity', 'well', 'played', 'out', 'plot', 'film', 'never', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'violence', 'sex', 'great', 'job', 'contributing', 'overall', 'story', 'rather', 'simply', 'being', 'film', 'actual', 'purpose', 'Anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'short', 'spectacular', 'film', 'view', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'films', 'will', 'work', 'just', 'fine', 'Jenifer', 'true', 'stand', 'out', 'peers']",Masters of Horror - Dario Argento - Jenifer

The film follows the plight of a cop who stumbles apon a crazed man trying to decapatate a woman by a river. The cop proceeds to shoot the man and save the damsel in distress. Sounds like the beginning to a nice love story right?...no. The cop is shocked to discover that the woman is horribly disfigured, sporting a pair of huge black eyes and razor sharp teeth. After failed attempts to get rid of her, the cop brings her home where Jenifer displays her terrible manners by eating the family cat. This doesn't sit well with the wife and she leaves before losing her lunch. With the wife gone and being in a nice big house alone with Jenifer the cop soon finds that Jenifer is amazing in the sack. (except for a few minor turn-offs like her twisted face and the fact that she sounds like an elephant)He begins to find that he is hopelessly addicted to Jenifer's passion and as that addiction grows so does Jenifer's murderous hunger for blood. I really enjoyed this film. I found it to be a very unique and innovative story in horror. I loved the symbolic ties between the characters (The cop slowly having his life distroyed by sex addiction and Jenifer, the seductive sucubus who's disfigurement reflects in a way her own nature but also the horror that she enflicts in her victim's lives.

She's got a ton of baggage, she'll strip you of everything you own and love, she's a lousy conversationalist, and she's got weird growths on her tongue.  I don't think the great sex can make up for all the negatives when dealing with Jenifer.  Who is she?  Where does she come from, and is she human at all?  Who the hell cares?  Do you?  I sure as hell don't.  In the disc's documentary, Dario compares Jenifer to a drug, and that's a wonderful analogy for this film.  Jenifer is indeed like a drug, and Steven Weber's character acts increasingly  more and more like an addict.  Even though the evil is so blunt and apparent he just can't let her go.  She's trouble the moment he brings her into the house.  Right off the bat she's biting his wife and eating his cat(hey, that rhymed pretty good, I should think about taking up rapping).  Realistically, you'd kick this chick's [...] all the way back to the looney bin or call the cops, but Jenifer's strength is the powerful drug-like hold she has over her ""owners"".  Weber loses everything because of this woman and it's an interesting and disturbing journey.  Being the Argento fan I am, I was very excited about this particular installment in the Masters Of Horror series.  And I certainly wasn't disappointed.  I didn't get the full impact until a short time after the film had ended and I took time to reflect on certain aspects of the film.  I can say in all honesty, this was very well done.  In terms of style, it's more like Argento's American works like Two Evil Eyes or Trauma, though totally different at the same time.  Fans will certainly check this out without a review to prompt them.  Some will(and do) just dismiss this as gruesome, unscary and dumb, but Argento's name is bulletproof to fans, so nanny-nanny-poo-poo.

994610,A2MD84CS3QMYAO,B000FS2W3A,tamiseena24,"[0, 3]","I saw this movie in a store, looked at the cover and was intrigued, read the back and it made me buy it.Watched it and as the end credits were rolling, my mind was scrambling for an answer to this movie, ""what was I thinking?"" I made my friend, who is also a huge horror-any movie buff and she thought the same thing as me. Confusion. Reading the back I knew there was gonna be some nudity (and heck i like porn so no biggie) but I really think that they worked harder on the sex scenes than the horror and story itself, cuz i really do think this is a intriguing concept and it could have gotten far. However I felt like i was watching some porn movie and it slacked (even for a porn). There's ways to subtly get the obsession and what not shown.I was thinking also that I needed more of a story about her like obviously that there's something about her that the obsession occurs. Like, maybe she wants us to  think its because of her body but maybe she like radiates some chemical to make you a retard and so she becomes the predator as you are the prey about to get your innards ripped out.  And i just cross her being abused out entirely, you cant beat up someone that bad to make her face that ugly but leave her body like that. sorry but if Im gonna beat someone Im gonna do it in more than one area. I really wanted to learn more about her and to understand how she got to become. I loved the gore and her being so fantastically gross but to me there needed to be a deeper story.I read where the person is like if you are a woman or gay you may not get it. And the person who's like that guy needs help. I don't think anyone needs help but trust me I'm a woman and i get it. I just don't understand throwing the life that you worked so hard to get and throw it all away for an ""thing"", ""it"", ""creature"", whatever you wanna call Jenifer? Than realize you need to get rid of her (because hey, look what she's doing to you) and you end up dead! You are dead now, bet you are wishing you didn't fall for her nice body now didn't you CUZ YOU ARE DEAD!! I think the people that rate this movie at a high rate enjoyed it a little too much with her body and technique, wishing they were getting some like that and to really prove that some males think more with that head than the actual head thats on their shoulders. YOU ARE DEAD and she's off having more sex and messing up with more people's life's...to me that sounds pretty crappy. This movie clearly shows how some males aren't being smart at all!!And Steven Weber, i enjoy him but him in this movie...man oh man, i just wanted to slap him silly.its a movie that confuses me and it makes me wonder why! but you got to have a not so good hit in your dvd collection. and this one is definitely, I warn people about!",1,Needed more work on the horror than the naked body,1292371200,"12 15, 2010",2010,2769,"['saw', 'movie', 'store', 'looked', 'cover', 'was', 'intrigued', 'read', 'back', 'made', 'buy', 'it.Watched', 'end', 'credits', 'were', 'rolling', 'mind', 'was', 'scrambling', 'answer', 'movie', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'made', 'friend', 'who', 'also', 'huge', 'horror-any', 'movie', 'buff', 'thought', 'same', 'thing', 'Confusion', 'Reading', 'back', 'knew', 'was', 'gon', 'be', 'nudity', 'heck', 'i', 'porn', 'so', 'no', 'biggie', 'really', 'think', 'worked', 'harder', 'sex', 'scenes', 'horror', 'story', 'cuz', 'i', 'really', 'do', 'think', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'far', 'However', 'felt', 'i', 'was', 'watching', 'porn', 'movie', 'slacked', 'even', 'porn', 'ways', 'subtly', 'get', 'obsession', 'what', 'not', 'shown.I', 'was', 'thinking', 'also', 'needed', 'more', 'story', 'like', 'obviously', 'something', 'obsession', 'maybe', 'think', 'body', 'maybe', 'chemical', 'make', 'retard', 'so', 'predator', 'are', 'prey', 'get', 'innards', 'ripped', 'out', 'i', 'just', 'cross', 'being', 'abused', 'out', 'entirely', 'cant', 'beat', 'up', 'someone', 'bad', 'make', 'face', 'ugly', 'leave', 'body', 'sorry', 'Im', 'gon', 'beat', 'someone', 'Im', 'gon', 'do', 'more', 'one', 'area', 'really', 'wanted', 'learn', 'more', 'understand', 'how', 'got', 'become', 'loved', 'gore', 'being', 'so', 'fantastically', 'gross', 'there', 'needed', 'be', 'deeper', 'story.I', 'read', 'where', 'person', 'are', 'woman', 'gay', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'person', 'who', 'guy', 'help', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'help', 'trust', ""'m"", 'woman', 'i', 'get', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'throwing', 'life', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'get', 'throw', 'away', 'thing', 'creature', 'wan', 'call', 'Jenifer', 'Than', 'realize', 'need', 'get', 'rid', 'hey', 'look', 'what', 'doing', 'end', 'up', 'dead', 'are', 'dead', 'now', 'are', 'wishing', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'nice', 'body', 'now', 'did', ""n't"", 'CUZ', 'ARE', 'DEAD', 'think', 'people', 'rate', 'movie', 'high', 'rate', 'enjoyed', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'body', 'technique', 'wishing', 'were', 'getting', 'really', 'prove', 'males', 'think', 'more', 'head', 'actual', 'head', 'thats', 'shoulders', 'ARE', 'DEAD', 'having', 'more', 'sex', 'messing', 'up', 'more', 'people', 'life', 'pretty', 'crappy', 'movie', 'clearly', 'how', 'males', 'are', ""n't"", 'being', 'smart', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'i', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'man', 'man', 'i', 'just', 'wanted', 'slap', 'movie', 'wonder', 'why', 'got', 'have', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'hit', 'dvd', 'collection', 'one', 'definitely', 'warn', 'people']",Masters of Horror - Dario Argento - Jenifer

It's a standard boy meets succubus story, with Steven Weber's cop saving an apparently mentally disabled and deformed girl from a homicidal psycho and is pretty soon actively proving the old saying that you don't look at the mantelpiece when you're poking the fire as his whole life goes to hell. Eating the family cat should have been a giveaway that it's not just her body that's built for sin, but even after she moves on to the neighbors' little girl he's still gotta have it...The ending is predictable from the opening scene so this is one where the execution has to carry the lack of surprise but, while perfectly competent, it's never really particularly inspired.

If, however, it was meant to create a sense of horror and terror within the viewer, then it failed miserably.  I should've listened to the other reviewers before buying Jenifer. The acting was terrible all the way around.  I didn't believe Steven Weber's character at all, I didn't like his wife, Jenifer (though sexy in her nightgown) began to get on my nerves with all of her whining sounds, and the ending could be seen coming from a mile away.  About the best thing in this hour-long production was when Jenifer was shaking the house cat back and forth in her mouth, and the cat was shrieking loudly in pain and fear.  You could tell that it was a stuffed animal, and it was funny enough to get me laughing out loud.  Don't buy this DVD without first viewing it.  Then, if you want the movie for your collection, be my guest.  If you want a Masters of Horror episode that's really nerve-racking, get Don Coscarelli's Incident On and Off a Mountain Road.

Freeman ""Zach""","[2, 6]","So, the reason this gets one star (besides the fact that you can't give zero stars) is because it's a made for TV movie, and so you have to give it some leeway as to how bad it's going to suck because of that.That said, Jenifer is an all-around terrible movie (well, hour long made-for-tv movie). The story is pretty predictable, and really just an excuse for weird pseudo-porn scenes with a woman who has a horribly disfigured face and a great body. Aside from Steven Weber, the acting is terrible, and I usually excuse that because of a bad script, but this bad acting went beyond that. I really feel sorry for the actors involved because it's obvious they either weren't trying, or just haven't got the experience or skill to pull off the scenes.Basically, a cop, Weber, sees a man about to kill a woman with a cleaver and shoots the guy to save her. Then he finds out that she has a horribly disfigured face (and a horribly disfigured mind as well). What follows is cinematic garbage with illogical plot lines and strange jumps in time that can only be explained by a low budget and a 60-minute time frame. It's really not even worthy of an hour on TV, much less a DVD release. Even if you're a huge horror fan, which I am, steer clear of this one.
