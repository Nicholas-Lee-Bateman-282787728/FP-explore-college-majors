The Greatest Story Ever Told is my favorite, but the Robe and The Bible are very close.  The films are well acted, well presented, and epic.  I would endorse these three to my closest friends.

1693561,A16JSMS8USLSCQ,B00I5EONJC,Bill Fisher,"[7, 7]","Since this set is on sale, you get three amazing Biblical epics of the 50s and 60s (the best epic movie era) on bluray for roughly $4 each. Amazing deal. If only for THE BIBLE and THE ROBE, it's incredible. Those two have been beautifully restored by 20th Century Fox and look brilliant on bluray. It's great to see John Huston's THE BIBLE looking so good...and those who saw this year's NOAH will be delighted with Huston's more traditional take on the Ark/Flood story. Huston is a terrific Noah and you get real animals loading into the ark. THE ROBE received a far more extensive restoration and it shows. For being as old as it is, it looks beautiful. Martin Scorsese does a nice intro and there are tons of extras. GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD doesn't fare as well. It looks like FOX/MGM/UA spent about 35 cents to put it on bluray. It even starts with a disclaimer warning that it was presented using the &#34;best available elements.&#34; But for $4, who cares. You at least get to see the great Herod sequence with Claude Rains.",5,What a great deal...,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,1032,"['set', 'sale', 'get', 'three', 'amazing', 'Biblical', 'epics', '50s', '60s', 'best', 'epic', 'movie', 'era', 'bluray', 'roughly', '4', 'Amazing', 'deal', 'only', 'THE', 'BIBLE', 'THE', 'ROBE', 'incredible', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'beautifully', 'restored', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'look', 'brilliant', 'bluray', 'great', 'see', 'John', 'Huston', 'THE', 'BIBLE', 'looking', 'so', 'good', 'who', 'saw', 'year', 'NOAH', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'Huston', 'more', 'traditional', 'take', 'Ark/Flood', 'story', 'Huston', 'terrific', 'Noah', 'get', 'real', 'animals', 'loading', 'ark', 'ROBE', 'received', 'far', 'more', 'extensive', 'restoration', 'being', 'as', 'old', 'beautiful', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'nice', 'intro', 'are', 'tons', 'extras', 'GREATEST', 'STORY', 'EVER', 'TOLD', ""n't"", 'fare', 'as', 'well', 'FOX/MGM/UA', 'spent', 'about', '35', 'cents', 'put', 'bluray', 'even', 'disclaimer', 'warning', 'was', 'presented', 'using', '34', 'best', 'available', 'elements.', '34', '4', 'who', 'least', 'get', 'see', 'great', 'Herod', 'sequence', 'Claude', 'Rains']",The Bible / Greatest Story Ever Told / The Robe
