The father (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker who echoes Ricky Bobby's dad in 'Talledega Nights'.  (""If you're not a winner, then you're a loser."")  He is an angry and frustrated patriarch who has difficulty living up to his own advice.  He's overbearing even with his understanding, loving wife (Toni Collette of 'Sixth Sense' fame), and his family shows that not only success, but love is missing in the family equation.The grandfather (Adam Arkin) is a foul-mouthed heroin addict who, unlike his son, shoots straight from the hip.  His teenage son, Duane, is a goth silent type who only communicates with a notepad.  His brother, and their uncle, is gay and has just attempted suicide before living with the family, interestingly enough sharing Duane's bedroom where they can have heart-to-heart talks.  The daughter (Abigail Breslin) is sweet, perceptive, and charming.  She's an arm for the family ego, so she is a candidate for ""Little Miss Sunshine,""  a nauseatingly glamorous child beauty contest taking place in California.Many mishaps come along the way as the whole family goes from Arizona to the Redondo Beach contest in an aging Volkswagon van.  The grandfather has a lot to say on the journey, including a shaking piece of wisdom for his granddaughter the night before the contest.  Having the pre-contest jitters, she hears her grandfather say, ""A real loser is someone who is so afraid of losing, they're afraid to try.""  The uncle also has much wisdom, including some advice to Duane about suffering that he seems to need and hear for himself in the same meeting.  With the admonition that our society has a low tolerance for failure, and the wit and laughter to set us all straight, 'Little Miss Sunshine' remains a sage and funny family satire.  (It is rated 'R,' so the laughs may be only for those family members at your discretion--mainly for a lot of profanity.)",4,The Missing Love,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,2092,"['Just', 'Squid', 'Whale', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'quirky', 'comedy', 'masterpiece', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'quests', 'love', 'greatness', 'father', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'who', 'Ricky', 'Bobby', 'dad', ""'Talledega"", 'Nights', ""'re"", 'not', 'winner', 'then', ""'re"", 'loser', 'angry', 'frustrated', 'patriarch', 'who', 'difficulty', 'living', 'up', 'own', 'advice', 'overbearing', 'even', 'understanding', 'loving', 'wife', 'Toni', 'Collette', ""'Sixth"", 'Sense', 'fame', 'family', 'not', 'only', 'success', 'love', 'missing', 'family', 'grandfather', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'foul-mouthed', 'heroin', 'addict', 'who', 'son', 'shoots', 'straight', 'hip', 'teenage', 'son', 'Duane', 'goth', 'silent', 'type', 'who', 'only', 'notepad', 'brother', 'uncle', 'gay', 'just', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'living', 'family', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'sharing', 'Duane', 'bedroom', 'where', 'can', 'have', 'heart-to-heart', 'talks', 'daughter', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'sweet', 'perceptive', 'charming', 'arm', 'family', 'ego', 'candidate', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'nauseatingly', 'glamorous', 'child', 'beauty', 'contest', 'taking', 'place', 'California.Many', 'mishaps', 'come', 'way', 'whole', 'family', 'Arizona', 'Redondo', 'Beach', 'contest', 'aging', 'Volkswagon', 'van', 'grandfather', 'lot', 'say', 'journey', 'including', 'shaking', 'piece', 'wisdom', 'granddaughter', 'night', 'contest', 'Having', 'pre-contest', 'jitters', 'grandfather', 'say', 'real', 'loser', 'someone', 'who', 'so', 'afraid', 'losing', ""'re"", 'afraid', 'try', 'uncle', 'also', 'much', 'wisdom', 'including', 'advice', 'Duane', 'suffering', 'need', 'hear', 'same', 'meeting', 'admonition', 'society', 'low', 'tolerance', 'failure', 'wit', 'laughter', 'set', 'straight', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'sage', 'funny', 'family', 'satire', 'rated', 'R', 'laughs', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'family', 'members', 'discretion', 'mainly', 'lot', 'profanity']",N/A

1029339,ADOUBP7AMWGKU,B000JU9OJ4,"Adam Cole ""adamjoncole""","[5, 6]","I didn't expect to love this film as much as I did - especially as it was my very last choice when I was desperate for a movie. Man, am I glad there wasn't anything else on - it would have been a tragedy to miss this.The film itself is the tragic tale of a family of screw-ups making their way across the US to attend a children's beauty pageant. The plot is really secondary to its characters. And what a bunch of characters. My personal favourite is Uncle Frank, a suicidal, gay, Proust professor. (Hell, if I spent my life specializing in Proust, I'd be suicidal too). Considering Steve Carrell's surprising restraint in the role I was surprised that every time I saw Frank I started laughing involuntarilty (even when he was just sitting or standing motionless). Condemned to spend most of the film stuck with the family's sulky, misanthropic son who has taken a vow of silence, Frank serves as our semi-normal proxy into the world of this extraordinarily strange family.The most extraordinary character in this menagerie is Grandpa (Alan Arkin), a foul mouthed heroin using curmudgeon who can't go a single scene without being offensive. In short, I loved him. He had some of the best lines in the film (e.g., ""Get me some porn... the real nasty stuff""). He's the sort of character that you can't take your eyes off, even when he's unconscious, in case you miss his next trick. I haven't seen many Alan Alda films, but if this is a gauge of his calibre then I'll be raiding the video store for more.Toni Collette as the long-suffering mother appears to be the only normal member of the family, although she gives the sense of unravelling at the edges. Olive, the sweet and innocent daughter who wants to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine contest seems to be at the centre of the family and in a weird twist is ultimately their redemption. Rounding off the cast is Greg Kinnear as the Success Coach father, whose attempts at inspiration seem to have the complete opposite effect. Again, like most of the others, he also seems to be coming apart at the seams.I'm pretty sure there was a message to this film, but I'll be hornswozzled if I can figure it. It seems to be about the pursuit of success, by people who have never had it and probably never will. For all his talk of being a winner, the success coach father's life is one of endless failure... but he keeps plugging away. Olive has no chance in hell of winning the beauty pageant, but she goes for it no matter what. Uncle Frank can't seem to win no matter what he does but at least seems to have resigned himself to failure and ultimately finds some meaning in it. The Neitzche driven son, driven to the edge by his pursuit of success is probably the most tragic loser of the group, but his ultimate destruction is also the most amusing (at least to me).I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I adore films about losers, and this seemed like the jackpot for me. Even the Simpsons weren't as pathetic as this bunch. Thanks and triple thanks to Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris for bringing me this glorious display of human wretchedness.

This film was nominated for best picture and Alan Arkin won best supporting actor, I was worried this film would be a disappointment but I was pleasantly surprised.

Abigail Breslin (also nominated) is ray of sunshine as a beauty pageant hopeful Olive Hoover, she is plain, chubby, and less than graceful but she has tremendous heart. Breslin's performance is pretty amazing for someone so young, and jeez she's been in like a thousand films after this one made her famous.

1029343,A319Y83RT0MRVR,B000JU9OJ4,AIROLF,"[4, 6]","Little Miss Sunshine has a sunny heart. The movie is heartwarming, without being sugarcoated; it's sweet without being saccharine.Exiting the movie theater, I overheard a woman say that Little Miss Sunshine was real. I agree. The movie might not have the most common plot or the most ordinary characters, but its dysfunctional family and a sense of failure resonate with all of us. This movie does not follow a formula and it doesn't try to impress you with any of the traditional Hollywood gimmicks; instead it tells a story the way it's meant to be told - unbegrudgingly and unhinderingly. Its allure is that it's fresh, funny, and innocent, even when profanities are being uttered left and right.What is most redeeming about this movie, however, are the characters and the superb cast of actors who play them. If one look at the cast reveals a cast full of B movie stars that have never made it big, then these talented people are extremely misjudged and underpaid. Steve Carrell, who arguably is no longer a B movie star after the 40-year-old Virgin crossed the $100 million at the box-office, is incredibly convincing as Frank, the uncle who attempted to commit suicide because of an unrequited homosexual love. Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense, In Her Shoes) delivers Sheryl, a mother trying to keep her family together, who is at her wits' ends about the life;s failures, so distinctively that it's a wonder if Collette is actually acting or portraying her own experience. Alan Arkin (Jacob the Liar, Gattaca)'s Grandpa is one of the best forefathers on screen. Seeing Paul Dano (The Girl Next Door, Taking Lives) as Dwayne one is amazed and belittled by Dano's tremedous talent. Dano, who spends most of the movie mimicking and writing his lines on a notepad, is an exceptionally talented young man and a promising actor. Furthermore, Greg Kinnear (As Good As it Gets, You've Got Mail) has one of the best performances of his life as Richard, the father who invented a 9 Step Program to winning, but can't seem to win in life himself.Yet, what this movie needed was a strong heroine, a girl who isn't waif thin; a girl who has the charm and charisma to steal the show and delight us and it could have no one better than Abigail Breslin (The Signs, Raising Helen), who plays Olive, the little girl who is eligible to compete in Little Miss Sunshine, a California beauty pageant for 6- to 7-year-old girls. Breslin is a girl with a very, very bright future. She isn't a supermodel, but she is better - more human and more real.The last ten minutes of this movie will delight, surprise, and entertain you. The rest of the moviegoers in my theater laughed until their hands could clap no longer and their faces were full of glee after the movie ended. The movie brought a childhood smile, one of true wonderment and enjoyment to everyone's face.If you can make people laugh that hard about everybody's worse fear, you don't only have a comedy, you've got a true classic.Little Miss Sunshine is a winner, but not because it tries and never gives up. It's a winner in the truest sense of the word - it warms your heart and entertains you until the very last credit rolls.",5,a ray of funny,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,3171,"['Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'sunny', 'heart', 'movie', 'heartwarming', 'being', 'sugarcoated', 'sweet', 'being', 'saccharine.Exiting', 'movie', 'theater', 'overheard', 'woman', 'say', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'was', 'real', 'agree', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'most', 'common', 'plot', 'most', 'ordinary', 'characters', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'sense', 'failure', 'resonate', 'movie', 'not', 'follow', 'formula', ""n't"", 'try', 'impress', 'traditional', 'Hollywood', 'gimmicks', 'instead', 'story', 'way', 'meant', 'be', 'told', 'unbegrudgingly', 'unhinderingly', 'allure', 'fresh', 'funny', 'innocent', 'even', 'when', 'profanities', 'are', 'being', 'uttered', 'left', 'right.What', 'most', 'redeeming', 'movie', 'however', 'are', 'characters', 'superb', 'cast', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'one', 'look', 'cast', 'cast', 'full', 'B', 'movie', 'stars', 'have', 'never', 'made', 'big', 'then', 'talented', 'people', 'are', 'extremely', 'misjudged', 'underpaid', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'who', 'arguably', 'no', 'longer', 'B', 'movie', 'star', '40-year-old', 'Virgin', 'crossed', '100', 'million', 'box-office', 'incredibly', 'convincing', 'Frank', 'uncle', 'who', 'attempted', 'commit', 'suicide', 'unrequited', 'homosexual', 'love', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Her', 'Shoes', 'delivers', 'Sheryl', 'mother', 'trying', 'keep', 'family', 'together', 'who', 'wits', 'ends', 'life', 's', 'failures', 'so', 'distinctively', 'wonder', 'Collette', 'actually', 'acting', 'portraying', 'own', 'experience', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Jacob', 'Liar', 'Gattaca', 'Grandpa', 'one', 'best', 'forefathers', 'screen', 'Seeing', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Girl', 'Next', 'Door', 'Taking', 'Dwayne', 'one', 'amazed', 'belittled', 'Dano', 'tremedous', 'talent', 'Dano', 'who', 'most', 'movie', 'mimicking', 'writing', 'lines', 'notepad', 'exceptionally', 'talented', 'young', 'man', 'promising', 'actor', 'Furthermore', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'As', 'Good', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'life', 'Richard', 'father', 'who', 'invented', '9', 'Step', 'Program', 'winning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'win', 'life', 'himself.Yet', 'what', 'movie', 'needed', 'was', 'strong', 'heroine', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'waif', 'thin', 'girl', 'who', 'charm', 'charisma', 'steal', 'show', 'delight', 'could', 'have', 'one', 'better', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Signs', 'Raising', 'Helen', 'who', 'Olive', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'eligible', 'compete', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'California', 'beauty', 'pageant', '6-', '7-year-old', 'girls', 'Breslin', 'girl', 'very', 'very', 'bright', 'future', ""n't"", 'supermodel', 'better', 'more', 'human', 'more', 'real.The', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'will', 'delight', 'surprise', 'entertain', 'rest', 'moviegoers', 'theater', 'laughed', 'hands', 'could', 'clap', 'no', 'longer', 'were', 'full', 'glee', 'movie', 'ended', 'movie', 'brought', 'childhood', 'smile', 'one', 'true', 'wonderment', 'enjoyment', 'everyone', 'face.If', 'can', 'make', 'people', 'hard', 'everybody', 'worse', 'fear', 'do', ""n't"", 'only', 'have', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'got', 'true', 'classic.Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'winner', 'not', 'never', 'up', 'winner', 'truest', 'sense', 'word', 'heart', 'very', 'last', 'credit', 'rolls']",N/A

Times is tough for the Hoover clan, but somehow, miraculously, they make it.Greg Kinnear is faultless as the obsessively positive self-help guru wananabe, a homeless man's Tony Robbins.  Toni Collette is equally on point, here's a mom who serves dinner out of a box and empathy out of a scowl.  Secondary characters lift the level higher; Alan Arkin is hilarious as the smack-snorting gramps that coaches Olive in dancing and Dwayne in dating, his political incorrectness is simply inspiring.Writer Michael Arndt must be given high marks for this motley crew of characters.  Brother Frank, realized to perfection by Steve Carell of ""The Office"" fame, is a suicidal homosexual in danger of losing his title of world's leading Proust expert.  Dwayne, by contrast, is a teenage devotee of Nietzsche, consumed by hatred, strictly practicing a vow of silence. Watching their relationship evolve is particularly touching.As the bizarre events unfold, one knows that the payday will come at the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.  That said, when it does, you're still not ready for it.  Gramps, by now long gone, is so very alive in every bit of it.  It is uproariously funny, and very defiant too, mirroring Dwayne's rage.

1029345,A3JQRM0U1T8QRO,B000JU9OJ4,"Allan Ostermann ""allan""","[1, 5]","I'm sure plenty of people here will share their favorite humorous moments from this film, and there certainly are plenty. But I left with a feeling that's different than say an Adam Sandler or Will Ferrill dork-a-thon. This movie has heart, and it deals with the human condition.One theme that repeats itself is that ""you don't win if you don't play"" (to quote a Lotto slogan). Alan Arkin's character intimates this twice, once to Olive and once to his son (Greg Kinnear). When Olive relates her fear of losing (much of it based on the brainwashing of her father and his '9-Step Success Program'), how she doesn't want to be a loser, and that there's nothing worse than being a loser, Grandpa tells her that the only loser is the person who never tries. If one fails, at least he/she tried. Arkin again says this to his son, Kinnear, after he fails after trying to sell success. Kinnear may be bankrupt, but he tried, and you can't be a loser if you try.The other idea that stood out for me is similar to the Buddhist belief that life is suffering, and unless you suffer, you never truly live. Steve Carrell's character tells this to the silent son; quoting Marcel Proust, the man inadvertantly responsible for his failure. Carrell tells him that real growth in life and true wisdom come from making it through often unbearable pain. This, he says, is living, not so-called happiness. Without this conflict, there can be no growth; and when Proust looked back upon his life it wasn't the good times he cherished, it was the pain. Then they joke about how lucky the boy is to be given all of the ""opportunities for growth"" than the teen years offer.These are pretty heady themes for a Hollywood sit-com. But ""Little Miss Sunshine"" isn't typical. It's not a typical dysfunctional family movie, it's not a typical roadtrip movie, and it's not a typical comedy. It's smart, and it leaves you with more than a tummy ache from too much popcorn.",5,Funny..and wise.

It was brilliant to see everything going wrong in just the most perfect way!The movie centers around a charming but awkward 7-year-old who wants to compete for a beauty pageant for Little Miss Sunshine.  It contrasts the jaded enthusiasm of the little girl's grandfather with the somewhat cynical aggressive optimism of her father, and the frank cynicism of her half-brother, who has taken a vow of silence.  The movie also contrasts the despair of the silent brother with that of the suicidal uncle (who is under very close supervision, for a possible repeat attempt; no sharp objects allowed).The young actress, Miss Breslin, is so natural that it hardly seems acting.  (A lot of movies work beautifully with almost no acting by the actors, and this one is an example.  There's plenty of time for Abigail Breslin to learn to portray the fact that she IS acting, to impress the critics.)  She is so utterly a seven-year-old being a seven-year-old that I could have cried!  The way she bounces up and down when she's excited is worth it all, at least for me!It's tempting to look for morals in this movie.  I don't think there are any really big messages; in any case, you just can't do it in a movie; you can only portray the consequences of certain kinds of actions, and even then, you just know that luck and random chance play a large role.  What appeals to me in this movie are those odd moments when even the most obnoxious characters set their self-interest aside, even if temporarily.I didn't think the dance routine at the pageant was particularly funny, but then I know the movie wasn't made for me personally.  (I've known that for several hours, now.)  I can see how it could be hilarious for some people, and I did find myself chuckling.The cast was very strong, the writing was excellent, and this movie deserves every good thing it receives.

1029350,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000JU9OJ4,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 3]","During the 2006 Awards Season there was no film that made an impact quite like `Little Miss Sunshine'.  You can argue and say that `The Departed' made such an impact, beings that it did walk away with top honors, but seriously, no one was talking about `The Departed' like they were talking about `Little Miss Sunshine'.  It became a phenomenon.  The following year `Juno' waltzed up to an Oscar nomination thanks to the success this little yellow bus and even this years `Slumdog Millionaire' is being called the `Little Film that Could'.  `Little Miss Sunshine' represents that little independent film that garners cult status quickly and finds a place in the hearts of award bodies everywhere.Now I liked this movie, but personally it isn't deserving of the unabashed praise it received.  It's actually quite common and not very imaginative when you think about it.  It's sweet and charming but nothing new, and while it has it's moments of wit it also has awkward moments that you know are supposed to be funny, but just aren't.It's a mixed bag for me.The film follows the Hoover family (as dysfunctional as they come) as they embark on a cross country trip to get young Olive to a beauty pageant.  Richard, the father, is a self obsessed man who aspires to get famous off his step program to a better you.  His wife Sheryl is merely trying to hold together her family while remaining remotely sane.  Their oldest son Dwayne has taken a vow of silence while he waits to join the Air Force.  Richard's father Edwin is a foul mouthed gruff drug addict with a heart of gold and Sheryl's brother Frank is a suicidal teacher who is crumbling emotionally after a sour relationship with a male student.  Stuck in the middle is young impressionable Olive who just wants to be pretty.Everything that can go wrong does go wrong, but tagged onto the end of this comedy is a message of togetherness and family; a spark of sweet saccharine goodness that makes you feel a little better about yourself and your loved ones.  I understand why people like this film; even I liked it, but I find it hard to consider it the best of anything.Breslin is a natural talent; very genuine and believable.  One friend of mine said that he never caught her acting, which is very true.  I have always liked Kinnear and I found his turn here probably best in show.  He was superbly entertaining and understandable as the controlling father obsessed with winning.  Toni Collette continues shining her beacon of light on everything she touches; and I adore her for that.  There was a lot said about the supporting actor race that year and the three `Sunshine' men; Alan Arkin, Steve Carell and Paul Dano.  Honestly I fell that AMPA's got this one right, and I know that not many agree with me there.  I thought that Arkin was very genuine and heartwarming here, even at his crudest.  No, he should not have won, but that's beside the point.  Carell was also very warm here and understood his character (what a stretch for him) and Dano was interesting yet a little vapid.  I found his emotional breakdown rather hard to believe, but he does try really hard so I'll give him props for that.  He stepped up his game in a HUGE way the following year with a stellar performance in `There Will Be Blood'.Truth be told, the funniest parts in this movie involve running, and just the sight of any of the cast barreling down a street or a parking lot gives me the giggles.  It is also a true statement that some parts of this film fall flat.  Like I said; a mixed bag.  It's fun, but not great.  You will enjoy it, but if you walk into this expecting it to deliver on all the hype you may find yourself disappointed.",4,The little film that stole America's heart...,1232668800,"01 23, 2009",2009,3680,"['2006', 'Awards', 'Season', 'was', 'film', 'made', 'impact', 'quite', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'can', 'argue', 'say', 'Departed', 'made', 'impact', 'beings', 'did', 'walk', 'away', 'top', 'honors', 'seriously', 'one', 'was', 'talking', 'Departed', 'were', 'talking', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'became', 'phenomenon', 'following', 'year', 'Juno', 'waltzed', 'up', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'thanks', 'success', 'little', 'yellow', 'bus', 'even', 'years', 'Slumdog', 'Millionaire', 'being', 'called', 'Little', 'Film', 'Could', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'little', 'independent', 'film', 'garners', 'cult', 'status', 'quickly', 'place', 'hearts', 'award', 'bodies', 'everywhere.Now', 'liked', 'movie', 'personally', ""n't"", 'deserving', 'unabashed', 'praise', 'received', 'actually', 'quite', 'common', 'not', 'very', 'imaginative', 'when', 'think', 'sweet', 'charming', 'nothing', 'new', 'moments', 'wit', 'also', 'awkward', 'moments', 'know', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'just', ""aren't.It"", 'mixed', 'bag', 'me.The', 'film', 'Hoover', 'family', 'as', 'dysfunctional', 'come', 'embark', 'cross', 'country', 'trip', 'get', 'young', 'Olive', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'Richard', 'father', 'self', 'obsessed', 'man', 'who', 'get', 'famous', 'step', 'program', 'better', 'wife', 'Sheryl', 'merely', 'trying', 'hold', 'together', 'family', 'remaining', 'remotely', 'sane', 'oldest', 'son', 'Dwayne', 'taken', 'vow', 'silence', 'join', 'Air', 'Force', 'Richard', 'father', 'Edwin', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'gruff', 'drug', 'addict', 'heart', 'gold', 'Sheryl', 'brother', 'Frank', 'suicidal', 'teacher', 'who', 'crumbling', 'emotionally', 'sour', 'relationship', 'male', 'student', 'Stuck', 'middle', 'young', 'impressionable', 'Olive', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'pretty.Everything', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'go', 'wrong', 'tagged', 'end', 'comedy', 'message', 'togetherness', 'family', 'spark', 'sweet', 'saccharine', 'goodness', 'feel', 'little', 'better', 'loved', 'ones', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'film', 'even', 'liked', 'find', 'hard', 'consider', 'best', 'anything.Breslin', 'natural', 'talent', 'very', 'genuine', 'believable', 'One', 'friend', 'mine', 'said', 'never', 'caught', 'acting', 'very', 'true', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Kinnear', 'found', 'turn', 'here', 'probably', 'best', 'show', 'was', 'superbly', 'entertaining', 'understandable', 'controlling', 'father', 'obsessed', 'winning', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'shining', 'beacon', 'light', 'everything', 'adore', 'was', 'lot', 'said', 'supporting', 'actor', 'race', 'year', 'three', 'Sunshine', 'men', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Honestly', 'fell', 'AMPA', 'got', 'one', 'right', 'know', 'not', 'many', 'agree', 'thought', 'Arkin', 'was', 'very', 'genuine', 'heartwarming', 'here', 'even', 'crudest', 'No', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'won', 'beside', 'point', 'Carell', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'warm', 'here', 'understood', 'character', 'what', 'stretch', 'Dano', 'was', 'interesting', 'yet', 'little', 'vapid', 'found', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'rather', 'hard', 'believe', 'try', 'really', 'hard', ""'ll"", 'give', 'props', 'stepped', 'up', 'game', 'HUGE', 'way', 'following', 'year', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Will', 'Be', ""Blood'.Truth"", 'be', 'told', 'funniest', 'parts', 'movie', 'involve', 'running', 'just', 'sight', 'cast', 'barreling', 'down', 'street', 'parking', 'lot', 'giggles', 'also', 'true', 'statement', 'parts', 'film', 'fall', 'flat', 'said', 'mixed', 'bag', 'fun', 'not', 'great', 'will', 'enjoy', 'walk', 'expecting', 'deliver', 'hype', 'may', 'find', 'disappointed']",N/A
1029351,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000JU9OJ4,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[5, 7]","I caught a free screening of Little Miss Sunshine in Chicago the other day at the reccomendation of a friend of a friend.  I had seen previews for the film and I thought that it looked good, and when I learned that the producers were holding promotional pre-screenings to get word-of-mouth going, I was very excited.  I went to the theater with high hopes of a quirky road comedy with Steve Carrell, who never fails to make me laugh.  I did have a slight worry in the back of my mind; road comedies tend to be trite and formulaic, but I was relying on the fact that this is an indie film to show me something new.I was not disappointed; in fact, the film was much better than what I was expecting.  Even though I knew the entire story going into the film, the family's journey was the focus of the film, not their destination.  For anyone who doesn't know, Little Miss Sunshine is about a bizarre lower class family from New Mexico.  When Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin), the young daughter, wins the local Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant by default, she is entered into the nationals in California.  She and her family pack themselves into an ancient VW bus and take a two day drive west.  Father Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a wannabe motivational speaker who takes his schtick a little too seriously.  He preaches about the difference between ""winners"" and ""losers"" and tries to use his routine on his fed-up family.  His inability to actually get an audience is a big factor in keeping his family barely above the poverty line.  His wife Sheryl (Toni Collette) is probably the most normal of the group, but she seems to be constantly on the verge of a nervous break-down.  She tries to keep the rest of her wacky family from killing each other, and resorts to smoking (a loser activity by Richard's standards) to relieve the stress.  Olive's brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a kooky Neitche fan who wants to be an Air Force test pilot.  He has taken a vow of silence and claims that he will keep it up until he achieves his goal of becoming a pilot.  He also claims to hate ""everyone"".  Richard's father Edwin (Alan Arkin) and Sheryl's brother Frank (Carrell) also live with the nuclear Hoover family.  Edwin is a heroin-snorting old man who uses profanity-laden speech, loves pornographic magazines, and tends to offer lewd advice to people who don't really want it.  He also is Olive's coreographer.  Frank is a homosexual Proust scholar who tried to kill himself when someone he loved rejected him.If nothing eventful happened to the Hoovers on their trip, their personalities alone would be enough to drive the comedy of the film.  However, crazy things do happen, such as the clutch failing.  This forces them to park uphill in order to have an easier time getting the car going again.  If a hill isn't around, they have to push the car, then jump in while its moving.  Navigational errors, getting pulled over, and an unfortunate encounter with a certain person from Frank's past all factor in to the trip, and many of the events are simultaneously hilarious and sad.  The film's climax at the pageant is amazing because it is both hilarious and creepy.  I don't want to give away why, but suffice to say that I was trying to figure out whether it was ok to laugh at certain things.It's interesting to watch how these different characters react to the situations around them.  Richard has his motivational speaking, Sheryl has her smoking, and Edwin has his drugs.  However, the best person in the family is Olive, who completely embraces everything that happens.  Walking around in huge glasses, a sweatband, and huge headphones, Olive doesn't care that she and her family are odd, she only wants to do LMS, and is the only genuinely happy person in the family.Little Miss Sunshine is a great film that I think most people can enjoy.

The entire cast is great - Alan Arkin (who is hilarious) won the Oscar, but really any one of the six could have won.  What I like about Little Miss Sunshine the most is that it's a feel-good movie that never feels corny or manipulative.  The reason being that hovering around the sunshine the film casts are the dark clouds of depression, suicide, drug abuse and failure.  The film could be just as easily depressing and dark as it could be sappy and sentimental, but the two polar opposites  keep the  other in check and create a fun, quirky atmosphere.  The film isn't perfect - its comments on beauty pageants and America's obsession with winning seem a bit forced, contradictory and weigh down everything else.

I enjoy Toni Collette in pretty much everything.  She's good here, but the standouts are Greg Kinnear (his 'Nine Steps' Tony Robbins-wannabe shtick is great stuff) and Steve Carrell.  From 'Talk Soup' and 'The Daily Show' respectively, these guys have turned themselves into wonderful actors.  In fact, the movie's best acting comes from Kinnear, especially in the scene where he sits in the audience at the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant and realizes - with growing concern - the probable talent gap between the contestants and what he imagines his daughter Olive is about to bring to the stage.  [But even he can't imagine what Olive has in store, although her music choice - 'Super Freak' - and her grandfather's taste in reading material give a pretty clear indication.]Despite Alan Arkin's fine work here, I still think Eddie Murphy got totally jobbed out of his Oscar.  Arkin's role is rather abbreviated here (for reasons that are obvious to anyone who's watched the film).  In contrast, Murphy's take on James 'Thunder' Early in 'Dreamgirls' is a tour de force.

Very much like Wes Anderson's movies (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic) it works on a number of different levels.  It's hilarious and heartwarming at the same time, without venturing into cheeseball/emo territory (like the reprehensible Garden State.)  It does what every great piece of art does: it gives you a greater appreciation for those around you and for life itself.  And it does so without being pretentious, heavy handed, or contrived.  That's not an easy thing to do.The film follows the Hoover family on their cross country trip from Arizona (I think) to California.  The mission: take daughter Olive to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.  Hilarity and chaos then ensue.  Whenever the mood gets serious is usually when the biggest laughs are about to occur.  This deft balancing between laughs and seriousness is what makes this movie truly amazing.  The high points are some of the funniest moments you'll ever see in a movie. The dinner table scene; when the family gets pulled over; the beauty pageant...those scenes are transcendent comedy.  It will probably remind you of your own family in some ways as well.The characters are all expertly crafted and portrayed.  All of these are people whom you are instantly familiar with.  They may be friends, co-workers, neighbors, family....I don't think there is a single character in the film that most won't make a one-to-one correlation with people they know in their own lives.  Maybe not specifically, but we all know people whose personalities are similar to those of the Hoovers, without question.  This is truly what a ""family film"" should be, despite the R rating.

One of the best films of the year."" -- quote from fellow reviewer.You people must not watch any good movies.  That is the only way I can explain it.  This is movie is 'ok' at best.  It isnt the best of 2006 or 2005 or any year for that matter.  It is just a sarcastic, dark comedy that has a laugh or two.  Actually, the actors weren't even meant to be funny, I guess.  I guess we are supposed to believe that this is how this family would really act and wasn't intended to be funny.  Nobody really cracked a honest smile except for Dad.  I had to fast forward through a lot of the scenes.To be honest, in some of the scenes I felt kind of awkward, the scene between mom and dad at the hotel, dad dying, frank and that dude, the kid finding out about his eyes, the end of the beauty pageant?  Is this supposed to be funny?  I was expecting Steve Carell to give us something; in each one of his scenes, you almost expect him to take it a little further but NOPE he just kinds of stands there with a smirk.  Kinnear probably was the saving grace of the movie.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[8, 11]","The Screen Actors Guild have an ""Outstanding Performance by a Cast"" award they give out annually, and this year LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE must be among the nominees (if not the recipient).Never before has a story been so well told and equally acted. Moving the audience to tears one moment and making us burst with laughter the next, this script was absolutely brilliant.And the story goes...Young Abigail Breslin (SIGNS, 2002) plays Olive, a six-year-old whom the entire cast orbits around. The first place contestant in a local New Mexico beauty pageant got eliminated and Olive, who'd came in second, is the default winner. She's going to California for the Little Miss Sunshine finals. But due to financial limitations, the family can't fly her, so all of them pack into a VW bus and head west. With Abigail comes her barely functioning dysfunctional family. Her father is played by the estimable Greg Kinnear (THE MATADOR, 2005). Richard (Kinnear) is the only one who can drive a stick, so he has to go. But with him comes his ""are you a winner or loser"" motivational comments that irk everyone around him. Also with them comes Olive's older brother Dwayne (Paul Dano, THE KING). The 15-year-old has taken a vow of silence until he's passed a test that allows him to fly jets for the Air Force; he writes his caustic comments on paper for all to read. Then we have Frank (Steve Carrell, THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN) who was recently released from the hospital after slitting his wrists and is on suicide watch by the family. A renowned Proust scholar, Frank found himself fired from his teaching job after falling in love with a student; one of his male students. Next we have Olive's grandfather played pitch perfect by Alan Arkin (THIRTEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING, 2001). He's a smack-sniffing, perverted old man with a misplaced heart of gold. He's also Abigail's instructor for her dance sequence in the upcoming competition. And finally there's Sheryl (Toni Collette, IN HER SHOES), Olive's mother who is the glue that holds the family together.Road trip movies are practically a dime a dozen, but many miss the mark or become ludicrous. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE has no such problems. Bouncing off -- or sometimes smashing against -- each family members' personality, Olive (Breslin) is the unifying good-natured persona that makes this entire flick so very watchable. Olive is a bit overweight, wears thick eye-glasses, and has little talent. But her family loves her without restraint and when they stuff themselves into the dilapidated VW, it is her unflagging perkiness and smiling that drives them onward toward California, even when confronting a failed father, a difficult brother, a faulty clutch, or death.The dance sequence at the end of the film is something of movie legend. If you think about who Olive's grandfather was, the dance she chose to do was outstandingly accurate (what other kind of dance could a drug-addled, porn-watching old man teach?) Needless to say I cringed and laughed at the choreographer's choice. It also made me ask ""if"" I should be laughing at this, as it was completely deranged and inappropriate!I'm going to risk a lot here and say that I haven't seen a film this enjoyable in about two years. And the audience that watched it with me seemed to agree; they all stood and applauded when the credits started rolling.

The Hoover family of Albuquerque NM is teetering on the brink of disaster.Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) tries to maintain a desperately dynamic tone as he teaches a motivational class to six bored participants in a grungy classroom.  His wife Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) has to go a psychiatric hospital to pick up her brother Frank (Steve Carell), a university professor who attempted suicide over unrequited love for a male graduate student.She moves Frank into their suburban home where he has to bunk with teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dano), a devotee of Nietzsche, who has taken a vow of silence until he can escape his family by getting into the Air Force Academy.  Richard's dad (Alan Arkin), a resentful hippie, has been living with the Hoovers since getting kicked out of his retirement home for shooting heroin.  And he happens to be the only one who cares enough to make time for pudgy 7 year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) who wants to compete in beauty contests.Yet even all this desperation holds a compelling edge of black humor.  The plot immediately kicks into gear when circumstances involving a default move Olive into the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant to be held in Redondo Beach CA.  The family has three days to get Olive to the beauty pageant in their unreliable Volkswagon bus - and of course the grandfather and the suicidal uncle can't be left alone so they have to come, too.  As does poor Dwayne.Two key performances are Grandpa and Frank who have each decided they have nothing to lose.  Frank develops a bemused and gentle hands-off approach to events:  he just lets life happen to him and laughs at it.  In that way, he's a good companion for high-strung Dwayne.  Grandpa, on the other hand, gets increasingly impatient with the adults and poor squeamish Dwayne whom he peppers with inappropriate sex advice.But he's always there to reassure Olive and help her develop her dance routine as best as an old reprobate like him can.  I mean, what does he really know about sugary-sweet kiddie beauty pagents?  But he does his best by Olive, even helping her pick her music.  When the movie finally gets to the pageant after the family has been bickering and bonding on their increasingly bizarre road trip, you may burst out laughing when you recognize the first few notes of Olive's chosen song.  At least you will if you remember the 1980s - at the hilarious and inadvertent inappropriateness of it all.In the end, though, this is a story about a family that sticks together.

Some great B actors and comedians collaborated to make this story of ""real life"" so amusingly close to home for many people with different family histories.  In a world obsessed with reality tv, this film appeals to many different audiences beyond those who appreciate the sense of ""realness"" that those shows afford.  This film reaches those with visions of success and perfection, to the folks who have a crazy relative, or anyone who's ever been disgusted with the world of beauty and pageants.  There's something to be gained in this film for everyone.That is to say that despite a few ""contrived"" moments during the course of the film, the team of directors, actors, producers and staff are able to share a convincing picture of what it means to be a family experiencing all manner of adversity, and how they cope.  The movie itself deserves four stars, I feel, mainly because it's not one of those movies you'll find yourself wanting to watch over and over again, but the alternate endings and commentary add more flavor and insight into the creative process that went on, and definitely bump up that last star to make this a must-buy purchase for anyone who enjoys family ""dramedies"".",5,"A Good Flick, Worth Owning",1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,1471,"['Big', 'budget', 'cookie-cutter', 'formulaic', 'films', 'all-star', 'actors', 'extensive', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'days', 'wonder', 'people', 'have', 'become', 'desensitized', 'films', 'money-whoring', 'spineless', 'sequels', 'assail', 'them.This', 'movie', 'none', 'above', 'great', 'B', 'actors', 'comedians', 'collaborated', 'make', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'so', 'amusingly', 'close', 'home', 'many', 'people', 'different', 'family', 'histories', 'world', 'obsessed', 'reality', 'tv', 'film', 'appeals', 'many', 'different', 'audiences', 'who', 'appreciate', 'sense', 'realness', 'shows', 'afford', 'film', 'visions', 'success', 'perfection', 'folks', 'who', 'have', 'crazy', 'relative', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'disgusted', 'world', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'something', 'be', 'gained', 'film', 'everyone.That', 'say', 'few', 'contrived', 'moments', 'course', 'film', 'team', 'directors', 'actors', 'producers', 'staff', 'are', 'able', 'share', 'convincing', 'picture', 'what', 'be', 'family', 'experiencing', 'manner', 'adversity', 'how', 'cope', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'feel', 'mainly', 'not', 'one', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'find', 'wanting', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'alternate', 'endings', 'commentary', 'add', 'more', 'flavor', 'insight', 'creative', 'process', 'went', 'definitely', 'bump', 'up', 'last', 'star', 'make', 'must-buy', 'purchase', 'anyone', 'who', 'family', 'dramedies']",N/A

From an acting standpoint, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is an actor's showcase, which probably explains its Oscar success.I have an idiosyncratic complaint that no one but me probably cares about: this movie is geographically challenged, to say the least.  First, the idea that the family could be near Scottsdale in the morning and make it to Redondo Beach by mid-afternoon (especially in that van) defies all belief.  Second, as a former resident of the beautiful city of Redondo Beach, the location of the beauty pageant at the end is actually a Holiday Inn in Ventura near the pier.

Well, ""LMS"" seems to think this format is the only way to go.With one of the finest comedic ensembles of last five years (Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Steve Corell), ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is actually a lot of fun until Mr. Screenplay forces each member of the van load to have their ""moment."" The characters ham-handedly, and very conveniently experience a ""life changing situation/realization"" on their way to the titular competition. The road this film is travelling down is awkwardly melodramatic and cheap. (How else to explain a character's realization that he is colorblind, watching him freak out about this news, and then completely cool down and move on from the devastating moment ... all within about 5 minutes of screen time?) We'd almost respect the film more if the characters had their moments at the same time, instead of a paint-by-numbers ""Who's Next?"" type of line-up.Before the lesson plan however, the film and its cast shine. The first 30 minutes of the film have real promise as it teeters between comedy and tragedy, with each character wearing their respective dysfunction proudly on their sleeve. Abigail Breslin (though only 9 years old during filming, turns in an Oscar-caliber performance) plays ""Olive"", a character on the trip who is more or less the catalyst of the film. Breslin is entirely convincing as the easily excitable glue that holds the misfit family together, and breezily steals her scenes away from her costars.""Little Miss Sunshine"" is finally a disappointment: it creates some intriguing characters only to put them through a too-predictable cinematic therapy.

1029387,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000JU9OJ4,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 3]","Little Miss Sunshine was an excellent film, and I recommend it. The story is about a family of misfits who band together to take a quixotic journey in a yellow VW bus with no clutch, and a horn that is stuck in the honk position. On this journey they learn the importance of love, and family. That would be such a clich&eacute;, were it not so artfully executed. One of the scenes revolves around color blindness, and that seems an apt metaphor for the blind spots otherwise intelligent people can have when it comes to seeing their own needs to love and be loved.Steve Carell plays Frank Ginsberg, who is the nation's foremost Proust scholar. He has just attempted suicide because his rival, Larry Sugarman, the #2 Proust scholar, has stolen the young male graduate student he was in love with, he was fired from his teaching position, and Sugarman has just published a bestseller on Proust, and their ad campaign is calling Sugarman THE foremost Proust scholar. At the time this was made, Carell was not a hot commodity. Robin Williams or Bill Murray were considered for the part, but they couldn't afford them. The producers complained that Carell did not have enough star power to energize the film--but in the short year since, he starred in a hit movie, The 40-Year Old Virgin, as well as starring in a hit comedy series, The Office, for which he received an Emmy. He also appeared in Will Ferrell's Anchorman, but the character he played--a mentally challenged weatherman--gave no indication of the range he would display in Little Miss Sunshine.The perfect storm of success changed their minds, and Carell was called upon to promote the film. In fact, I just watched a little promotional clip on Amazon where he is actually interviewing himself, and both Carells do an excellent, though tongues firmly in cheeks, job of it. He is very adept at playing a gay intellectual, and shines particularly in his interactions with Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear), Grampa Hoover (Alan Arkin), Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin), and Dwayne (Paul Dano).Greg Kinnear plays a wannabe Tony Robbins, with a 9-Step program. He is cast well here. His boyish good looks serve him well, as they did in As Good As It Gets, but as they worked against him in Auto Focus, where he failed to play a convincing Bob Crane due to acute cuteness. Kinnear looks to be as shallow as Pat Sajak, but then when things don't go his way, he proves to be a veritable Alex Trebek, as he conveys a much more complex individual. He spouts clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, about the difference between winners and losers, and how he won't give up, but inside, he is crumbling. He is easily the least sympathetic character, just by his annoying perkiness, and that is quite an achievement when you are running against an angst ridden teenage nihilist who has taken a vow of silence, a pretentious homosexual suicidally depressed Proust scholar, and a foul mouthed dirty old man, who was kicked out of the retirement home for snorting heroin. However, by the end of the movie, even Richard is a candidate for redemption. His best line might have been spoken as they drove on with an incessantly honking horn and a corpse in the trunk, still desperately trying to get young Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant: ""Oh my God, I'm getting pulled over. Everyone, just... pretend to be normal.""Alan Arkin won an Oscar for best supporting actor, and though he only appears in the first half, his presence is felt throughout, and he thoroughly deserves his Oscar for this performance. He is foul mouthed, lascivious, and in our first encounter, he is shown snorting heroin (actually it was crushed up vitamin B12 tablets). He would seem to be an unlikely target of sympathy, but beneath that rough exterior beats a heart of gold.The earliest movie review I remember reading was for a film called Popi which starred Arkin. In it he plays Abraham, a Puerto Rican single father in Brooklyn who wants a better life for his two boys, so he contrives to pass them off as Cuban refugees. This was in 1969, long before the Elian Gonzales incident. ""Better to drown in the ocean than in the sewer"" was the tagline. What I remember from the film review was that they accused the director of ""doing the kids dirt"" by trying to manipulate the audience with their cuteness. I knew exactly what he meant, because there were these long montage scenes set to music of the kids cavorting and frolicking through a graveyard, acting so cute you wanted to puke.The directors of Little Miss Sunshine do not fall into this trap. Abigail Breslin plays a young beauty contestant hopeful. She is the Little Miss Sunshine of the title, but though you might think it is meant to be ironic and sarcastic, she is a hopeful ray of sunshine, without ever going too far into the excessive cuteness mode. For being in such a dysfunctional family, she is remarkably well adjusted, and though nave about many things, she seems to have an emotional wisdom beyond her years.Abigail wore a fat suit, and is in marked contrast to the actual child beauty pageant contestants tapped to play themselves, essentially, in the film. They used their actual costumes and routines, exactly as they would in competition. She wears glasses, and good use some dental work. But you keep hoping that her routine will hit a grand slam, but that possibility is remote considering her act was choregraphed by her recently deceased Grampa (Alan Arkin, in an Oscar winning supporting role). When you hear the music he chose, Rick James' Super Freak, you know her chances of an upset victory are nil.Also adept at avoiding the too-cute trap was Paul Dano as Dwayne, the teenager from a previous marriage who follows the teachings of Friedrich Nietzsche, has taken a vow of silence, dreams of being a jet pilot, and hates everyone, as he writes in a notepad. When Frank asks if his hatred includes his family, he underlines Everyone, for emphasis. He reluctantly agrees to go on the journey, when Sheryl, his mother, says if he does, she will pay for his flight school. He writes, OK, but I. won't. have. any. fun. This whole shtick of writing in the pad could get annoying, but actually is handled very well, as a great running gag. Key moments of his character's transformation or turns of plot are conveyed very skillfully with this device. His acting is none too shabby, either. At first he wears a t-shirt with the face of Big Brother, from George Orwell's 1984. Later his t-shirt bears the slogan: Jesus Was Wrong. Somewhere along the journey he goes through a subtle metamorphosis, and emerges as empathetic and sympathetic, while still avoiding the too-cute trap.Toni Collette plays Sheryl, the wife of Richard, daughter-in-law of Grampa, the sister of Frank, the mother of Olive, and the mother from a previous marriage to Dwayne. It was a very strong ensemble cast, and she was the glue that held the dysfunctional family together.The movie was a hit at Sundance, where it was picked up for about ten million dollars. It took a long time to make, about 5 years, due to difficulties getting financing. It was the proverbial ""Little Movie That Could."" The struggle to get this movie made would seem to parallel the struggle that Richard goes through to get his self help 9-step program book published. But in the movie's case, there was a much better outcome.Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris made The Smashing Pumpkins video for the song, 1979. In a scene in a convenience store, uncle Frank's purchase is $19.79.",4,"""Oh my God, I'm getting pulled over.

Miles,"[4, 6]","Since I am not big fan of the ""indie"" movie boom, I have, in the past, missed out on a number of good movies when they were in their theatrical releases. The newly released drama / comedy `Little Miss Sunshine' falls into that category for me. I missed it in the theatre and decided to take a chance on it when it came out on DVD. About halfway though the movie, I thought to myself that I had made the right decision not to shell out the money to see it in a theatre. However the last twenty minutes of the film simply blew me away, and made the entire first half of the movie worth watching.`Little Miss Sunshine' is the story of Olive, a cute but dumpy seven year old, obsessed with beauty pageants. Olive's immediate and extended family put the D in dysfunctional. Her father (Greg Kinnear) is a wanna be motivational speaker, her brother Dwayne is a Nietzsche disciple who has taken a vow of silence to escape his family's insanity, her grandfather (Alan Arkin) has a heroine habit, her uncle (Steve Carell) is on suicide watch, and her mother is struggling just to keep herself together. Through a series of events she and her entire family are forced to pack themselves into an old VW bus and head to California so she can compete in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant. What ensues is a collection of funny, awkward, and downright hilarious moments as each family member attemps to put aside their own problems to help little Olive's dream come true.I will admit, as a whole this movie will not appeal to everyone, and half way though many will begin to wonder if the rest of the movie is worth sitting though. Trust me it is. The last 20 to 30 minutes of this movie contain some of the most truly funny moments I have seen in a film in a long time. If you are offended by rough language, then you should think twice before buying or renting this movie, the F word is used quite often, and I know some may find that objectionable. If you think you can handle the language, then you should check this one out, it is definitely worth your time.",4,This movie is greater than the sum of it's parts.,1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,2047,"['am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'indie', 'movie', 'boom', 'have', 'past', 'missed', 'out', 'number', 'good', 'movies', 'when', 'were', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'newly', 'released', 'drama', '/', 'comedy', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'falls', 'category', 'missed', 'theatre', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'halfway', 'movie', 'thought', 'myself', 'had', 'made', 'right', 'decision', 'not', 'shell', 'out', 'money', 'see', 'theatre', 'However', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'simply', 'blew', 'away', 'made', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching.', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'story', 'Olive', 'cute', 'dumpy', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'obsessed', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'Olive', 'immediate', 'extended', 'family', 'put', 'D', 'dysfunctional', 'father', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'brother', 'Dwayne', 'Nietzsche', 'disciple', 'who', 'taken', 'vow', 'silence', 'escape', 'family', 'insanity', 'grandfather', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'heroine', 'habit', 'uncle', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'suicide', 'watch', 'mother', 'struggling', 'just', 'keep', 'together', 'series', 'events', 'entire', 'family', 'are', 'forced', 'pack', 'old', 'VW', 'bus', 'head', 'California', 'can', 'compete', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Pageant', 'What', 'collection', 'funny', 'awkward', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'family', 'member', 'attemps', 'put', 'aside', 'own', 'problems', 'help', 'little', 'Olive', 'dream', 'come', 'true.I', 'will', 'admit', 'whole', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'way', 'many', 'will', 'begin', 'wonder', 'rest', 'movie', 'worth', 'sitting', 'Trust', 'last', '20', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'contain', 'most', 'truly', 'funny', 'moments', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'are', 'offended', 'rough', 'language', 'then', 'should', 'think', 'twice', 'buying', 'renting', 'movie', 'F', 'word', 'used', 'quite', 'often', 'know', 'may', 'find', 'objectionable', 'think', 'can', 'handle', 'language', 'then', 'should', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'definitely', 'worth', 'time']",N/A

It's not suitable for children because of foul language, dirty jokes, and drug scenes.**** SPOILER. DO NOT READ THIS if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the MOVIE.For example, in the scene where the grandpa died in the hospital. The lady in charge of the corpse yelled at Greg Kinnear (the father) when he wanted to pospone the burial. She did not want to listen to his explanation why. It brillantly portraited how cruelly sometimes people treated each other. It moved me.The next scene is hilarious when it showed the family trying to sneak the corpse into their car to continue  their trip to California.The most moving scene was when Abigail walked to her brother who was extremely depressed and sitting on the ground. She then sat down beside him, saying nothing, just leanning on him.In the last scene, the director cleverly took aim at child-beauty-pageant industry. My stomach hurt when I saw kids from5-7 years old in heavy makeup did their catwalk. Adults were exploiting kids for their profit and pleasure!Abigail Breslin was the best actress here. She's so cute, lovely, and innocently funny. She's naturally beautiful without any makeup. Yes, her dance was meant for adults. But in my opinion, it's acceptable and funny.

It isn't that at all; it's a biting critique of a dysfunctional society.The family is actually the only source of support and solace available to the beleagered individuals depicted in the film as they each strive--and painfully fail to reach--the pinnacle of the American Dream: the top spot, the ""winner.""The banality of this goal is ruthlessly satirized as the movie progresses. Every conceivable form of American Success with a Capital S is savagely revealed as distorting and empty.The wholesome Dad swears under his breath as his dream of a motivational-speaker-writer empire crumbles before him; his family is disgusted by his hollow cheerleader motivational patter--the soundtrack, if you will, of the American Dream.The acerbic grandfather shoots heroin to control his various aches and pains, and rudely defines success as having sex with as many women as possible (hey, it worked for JFK, Bill Clinton and innumerable ""sports heroes"")--a crass, unwholesome portrayal of the ""real American Dream""-- or at least the male one.The harried, chain-smoking mother is frayed by the insuperable demands of holding the family together while she puts fast-food on the table and rescues her mentally unstable brother.Her brother, an openly gay aspiring academic superstar, is suicidal because another academic has replaced him as the number one Proust scholar--and snagged his gay lover to boot.The son, who has taken a vow of silence to express his open hatred of his family, single-mindedly works out in order to achieve his goal of being accepted to the Air Force Academy and becoming a pilot. His dreams are dashed by a weakness beyond his control, and he is inconsolable.The slightly chubby daughter pursues her dream of winning a sickeningly saccharine talent contest in California, ""Little Miss Sunshine."" Despite its wholesome veneer, the entire contest is deeply subversive of childhood, a bizarre distortion in which girls are made up to look like small adult women and perform ""Miss America"" type song-and-dance routines.The daughter's painfully bawdy routine--a searing exaggeration of the contest's subtext of pushing adulthood onto little girls--draws predictable howls of outrage from the contest authorities, and rallies the family to her side.When Granddad unexpectedly passes away, the American bureaucracy takes a mirthful beating as the family is forced to sneak the body out of the hospital and load it in their decrepit VW van.Though other bits of American life get similarly skewered, the key satire is of The American Dream of being a ""winner"".

Most of the Hoover family are living a frustrated and miserable existence as they try to make their individual ""dreams come true."" The only one who is isn't bitter is little 7 year old Olive who wants to win ""The Little Miss Sunshine"" beauty pageant. Olive isn't your typical beauty queen. But when the winner of her local pageant is unable to compete in the finals she is given her opportunity. Her father, Richard Hoover, is obsessed with winning. So he insists the family must make a last minute road trip to California so Olive can be a ""winner.""  The road trip portion of the film has it's funny moments. But does tend to bog down, as the family's mechanical troubles and other typical ""wacky hi-jinks"" aren't nearly as smart and original as the rest of the movie.The film really starts to run on all cylinders again when the family finally arrives at the pageant. Up until now the Hoover family had largely ignored the pageant world that little Olive longed to be a part of. But upon being exposed to the sick and twisted world of childhood beauty contests they are repulsed. At first they try to protect their daughter. But then allow her to participate so she can fulfill her ""dream."" By now they have finally realized the error of their self-centered ways and manage to unite as a family that loves and cares about each other.Along with the importance of family, the central theme of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is about our society's obsession with ""winners"" and ""losers"". Their desire to be ""winners"" was actually making the Hoover family miserable. Only when they let go of this obsession with ""winning"" were the family able to come together and be happy. Brother Dwayne sums it up best when he says it's better to just do what you love and forget the rest.

1029397,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000JU9OJ4,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 13]","What a great, great movie ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is; it tells a simple yet genuinely effective human story, and it includes characters that are very realistically portrayed. That's a treat from the audience's point of view; no matter how quirky or unconventional the circumstances of the film may be, normal characters have the remarkable ability to connect with viewers. The characters in this film make up the classic dysfunctional family, each member going through their own inner turmoil. They often fight, they regularly swear, and they each have personalities that clash to an incredible degree. How much more real can it get, especially when elements like financial trouble and emotional suffering are thrown into the mix? No one in this film is a rigid caricature, and that made it worthwhile.It's also a very funny film. But I'm using the word ""funny"" in a very different context, almost (but not quite) with an air of sarcasm. For the most part, it's not funny in a laugh-out-loud kind of way; rather, it's funny in an I-know-exactly-how-that-character-feels kind of way, presenting situations that the audience is able to understand and sympathize with. It was an interesting storytelling method, especially since every main character in this film is forced to partake in something they would rather do without. Olive (Abigail Breslin) is a seven-year-old girl who dreams of someday winning a beauty pageant. To say her family life in New Mexico is chaotic would be an understatement; she shares a home with family members that, at first glance, don't seem compatible in any way.The father, Richard (Greg Kinnear), is a completely misguided motivational speaker-wannabe. The mother, Sheryl (Toni Collette), is a typical caring mom who understands how bad the family's financial situation is. Of course, Richard is certain that his new program--a self-help system that is supposedly completed in just nine steps--will be hailed as the next big thing in striving for excellence. The brother, Dwayne (Paul Dano), is an incredibly unhappy teenager who wants to be in the Air Force and has recently taken a vow of silence (he's also taken to reading the works of Frederick Nitzsche). The uncle, Frank (Steve Carell), has recently attempted suicide due to a failed gay relationship, the loss of his job, and the loss of a prestigious teaching award. Finally, there's the grandfather (Alan Arkin), a cantankerous old man who seems to have many regrets in life, most of which involve not having lived fast or died young. For these reasons, he's now snorts heroine on a regular basis.Apparently, Olive had competed in an Albuquerque child beauty pageant and came in second. But some weeks later, Cheryl's sister calls and tells the family the good news: the first place winner of that contest has been disqualified (""Something to do with diet pills!""). By default, Olive is now eligible to compete in the national Little Miss Sunshine pageant. As you can probably imagine, this sends Olive into a whirlwind of excitement. But because Cheryl's sister is unable to take Olive, this sends the rest of the family into a whirlwind of doubt, uncertainty, and panic. The pageant is being held in Redondo Beach, California; not only can they not afford to fly there, Richard is also trying to contact marketing exec Stan Grossman (Bryan Cranston) in the hopes of turning the nine-step program into a sellable product. What's worse is that Frank can't be left alone for fear of another suicide attempt. The only viable solution is for the entire family to drive to California.Thus begins the family's journey across the Southwestern United States, one that will test them in almost every conceivable way. One of the biggest obstacles is their Volkswagen bus; the clutch is completely shot, and since they don't have the time or the money to repair it, they have to physically push the car until it reaches third gear (they also can't rely on the brakes). But more compelling are the emotional obstacles each character will have to clear in their own way. The scenes in the van were probably the most significant in terms of allowing the characters to face their problems. Bickering ensues almost immediately, especially between Grandpa, Richard, and Frank. But it's Richard's dialogue that is the most priceless: he just can't get out of his you-should-only-be-a-winner mode, constantly spewing his self-help banter about how methods like sarcasm and quitting are only used by losers. In fact, he thinks they represent one of the lowest of the nine steps. The only kinds of people who do deserve respect are those who actually have goals and are trying to follow them through.He praises Olive for this mindset; she wants to be involved in a beauty pageant, and because of consistent practicing and the firm belief that she can win, he's willing to support her. Of course, this makes Olive very concerned. From her point of view, her father hates losers, and if she doesn't win, she fears he'll stop loving her. Ready to reassure her is her grandfather; as crotchety as he is, he's also a caring individual, standing by his granddaughter's side no matter what (there's also a very touching scene in the van when he praises Richard for going after what he believed in). He even goes as far as to teach her some moves (none of which we actually see until the end of the movie; boy, is the audience in for a surprise).But this kind of character complexity isn't limited to just the grandfather; at one point or another, all the family members display different personality traits, ones that make them impossible to label. Again, I go back to the realism of the story: no one in this film is a flat, undeveloped stereotype, just as no one is completely good or bad. They're just ordinary, everyday, flawed people, and they do everything they can to get Olive to California in time. One gets the sense that no matter how much this family goes through, no matter how many arguments they have, they'll always be together, for better or worse. That's the kind of family we'd all like to have, especially when everyone can learn something valuable.By the time they reach California, they've gone through enough to last them a lifetime, from emotional breakdowns to malfunctioning van equipment to an escapade with a dead body (whose dead body I dare not say). And yet they're ready to let Olive do what she's always dreamed of doing. This is despite the fact that the world of children's beauty pageants hits them like a ton of bricks. Backstage, we see just how far these little girls go to look beautiful: they don hairpieces and false teeth; they're airbrushed with makeup and sunless tanners; they're dressed in sparkly, provocative dresses. When the contestants are on stage, Olive is the only one that actually looks like a real child (which basically means that she's not beauty pageant material).The final scenes of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" are almost too perfect for words. I won't describe them for want of you going out there and seeing this movie for yourself. I will say that it all comes together in a way that's beautiful, funny, and touching all at the same time. How appropriate for a film about the trials and tribulations of family life. There's quite a bit one can learn from a movie like this, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to experience it. One thing I learned was that this was more than story about a beauty pageant. It's actually much simpler than that; it's a story about life and discovering who you are in this world (and I don't mean that in a hokey way). What a perfect message; there aren't enough of them in movies these days.",5,"You Are My Sunshine, My Only Sunshine",1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,7644,"['What', 'great', 'great', 'movie', 'Little',

It had been pushed as a comedy, so I expected to, you know, laugh. I didn't. Well, not until the pagent scene.

The performances by the entire cast were wonderful, particularly Alan Arkin. I was also pleased by the directing. Dayton and Farris have come a long way since their days of music videos (of course, some of the ones they made were for the Smashing Pumpkins, my favorite band of all-time).I still find the film a bit twee at times.

How could I possibly be related to them?"" -- then you will probably appreciate the hilarious and poignant indie film ""Little Miss Sunshine.""Richard (Greg Kinnear) is the head of a mostly dysfunctional family and the author of a multi-step/self-help program that he espouses with the passion of a zealot.  Sheryl (Toni Collette) is Richard's wife and arguably the most normal and high-functioning member of the family.  Their son, Dwayne (Paul Dano), is a nihilistic and remote 15-year-old, who has either stopped speaking to his family because he can't stand them or taken a vow of silence to achieve a personal goal - depending on who is explaining his behavior.  Olive (Abigail Breslin) is the family's bright and effervescent 7-year-old, who is already starting to pick up some of the family's more unhealthy tics of criticism and self-doubt.  Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is Richard's acerbic and outspoken father who was booted out of his retirement home for snorting heroin.  Add to this murky Freudian soup Sheryl's brother, Frank (a wonderfully restrained Steve Carell), who is newly released from the hospital after a failed suicide attempt.When a message is left on the family's phone machine notifying them of Olive's acceptance into the semi-finals of the Little Miss Sunshine talent competition in California, they decide to (mostly) put aside their personal agendas and take Olive to the pageant.  The combustible road trip is fueled by the radically different personalities bumping up against each other within the close confines of a VW bus and exacerbated by a variety of obstacles thrown at them in what seems to be a cosmic conspiracy designed to prevent the family from reaching the competition.When the family finally does arrive at the pageant, the weirdness well and truly begins.  Now I am someone who really loves a good horror story, but the 6 and 7 year old contestants were far scarier than anything you might see in a George Romero movie.  I will take flesh melting zombies over little girls in full theatrical makeup and provocative costumes (that just screamed ""JonBenet Ramsey"") any day.  The whole pageant atmosphere was Fellini-esque and completely cringe-inducing.  When Olive is finally called upon to do her performance piece for the audience (a real show stopper which I won't spoil by detailing), she is actually the most wholesome and entertaining part of the whole pageant.Although this family bickers with one another almost constantly, they manage to close ranks and support each other when it truly counts.

Simply put, Oscar doesn't go for this stuff. Yeah it'll probably get a nomination but I usually call those""rounders"", meaning they're solely picked to round out the 5 nominations. Some were great movies, some were merely okay while others were like ""why's this up here?"" Little Miss Sunshine is a great movie sure but the idea Oscar will end up choosing this over some ""historically important"" but rather empty film"""" is either when they finally got some sense knocked into them or people will think this is some massive budget epic in line with Braveheart or Gladiator.Thanks to a contestant unable to compete, Olive Hoover is selected to compete in the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. However, family problems including suicide, a really mouthy relative and a struggling self-help guru wannabe prevent her from going. Unless you're in the Hoover family and they go on a road trip complete with a poor working vehicle and any other problem they run into.At a certain point, the grandpa of the family rants that they're having chicken again and I definately felt like that with my family. Not a week goes by where someone doesn't order pizza. This is one of those kind of films where it's easily to pinpoint the same occurence in real life complete with all its rough spots. While very ""R"" talking, the grandpa has a sweet relationship with his granddaughter that I've seen quite a few times and the angst-filled kid hates everyone yet can't resist the power of a good hug when everyone tries to figure out what to say.The casting is always essential in a movie and thankfully not a single cast member is interchangeable. Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin and Paul Dano are note-perfect as the father, mother, grandfather and the son respectively. The 2 standouts are restrained Steve Carell who's likable and funny without being overbearingingly so in a Jim Carrey/Robin Williams way. But the real star is actually Abigail Breslin. Known as the too-adorable daughter from Signs (how cute was it when she said she couldn't drink water because of her brother's amoebas) but here she's adorable and sincere without in that kind of cloying ""isn't she cute? We wrote her to be super cute"" way.Expect a double-dip, most likely around Oscars time since the special features are kind of skimpy. We get commentaries and alternate endings which are fine but don't beat the one in the film. Those girls that everyone was cheering over were so creepy, one literally looked like a porcelain doll. So when Olive does her routine, not only is it different and unique but it was actually more thrilling that showed the alternate ending was not the way to go.Sometimes if a thing gets too big, unfair expectations are placed on it. After the massive hype a film like Brokeback Mountain got, you walking thinking this is the greatest thing ever (and to be honest, I'm one of the few who hated it and it wasn't because of the issue in it) so if Little Miss Sunshine gets nominated and even wins, I'd bet dollars to those fattening Krispy Kremes the words ""overrated"" will be thrown around loads. But like a character says in the film, losers is when they're scared of winning and don't even bother trying and this is a film that tries its damnednest.",4,It would be the end of the world if this won the top prize...,1166745600,"12 22, 2006",2006,3349,"['Now', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'great', 'actors', 'quirky', 'humor', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Simply', 'put', 'Oscar', ""n't"", 'go', 'stuff', 'Yeah', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'get', 'nomination', 'usually', 'call', 'rounders', 'meaning', ""'re"", 'solely', 'picked', 'round', '5', 'nominations', 'were', 'great', 'movies', 'were', 'merely', 'okay', 'others', 'were', 'why', 'up', 'here', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'great', 'movie', 'sure', 'idea', 'Oscar', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'choosing', 'historically', 'important', 'rather', 'empty', 'film', 'when', 'finally', 'got', 'sense', 'knocked', 'people', 'will', 'think', 'massive', 'budget', 'epic', 'line', 'Braveheart', 'Gladiator.Thanks', 'contestant', 'unable', 'compete', 'Olive', 'Hoover', 'selected', 'compete', 'finals', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'pageant', 'However', 'family', 'problems', 'including', 'suicide', 'really', 'mouthy', 'relative', 'struggling', 'self-help', 'guru', 'wannabe', 'prevent', 'going', ""'re"", 'Hoover', 'family', 'go', 'road', 'trip', 'complete', 'poor', 'working', 'vehicle', 'other', 'problem', 'run', 'into.At', 'certain', 'point', 'grandpa', 'family', ""'re"", 'having', 'chicken', 'again', 'definately', 'felt', 'family', 'Not', 'week', 'where', 'someone', ""n't"", 'order', 'pizza', 'one', 'kind', 'films', 'where', 'easily', 'pinpoint', 'same', 'occurence', 'real', 'life', 'complete', 'rough', 'spots', 'very', 'R', 'talking', 'grandpa', 'sweet', 'relationship', 'granddaughter', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'angst-filled', 'kid', 'everyone', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'power', 'good', 'hug', 'when', 'everyone', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'say.The', 'casting', 'always', 'essential', 'movie', 'thankfully', 'not', 'single', 'cast', 'member', 'interchangeable', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'are', 'note-perfect', 'father', 'mother', 'grandfather', 'son', 'respectively', '2', 'standouts', 'are', 'restrained', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'who', 'likable', 'funny', 'being', 'overbearingingly', 'so', 'Jim', 'Carrey/Robin', 'Williams', 'way', 'real', 'star', 'actually', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Known', 'too-adorable', 'daughter', 'Signs', 'how', 'cute', 'was', 'when', 'said', 'could', ""n't"", 'drink', 'water', 'brother', 'amoebas', 'here', 'adorable', 'sincere', 'kind', 'cloying', ""n't"", 'cute', 'wrote', 'be', 'super', 'cute', 'way.Expect', 'double-dip', 'most', 'likely', 'Oscars', 'time', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'kind', 'skimpy', 'get', 'commentaries', 'alternate', 'endings', 'are', 'fine', 'do', ""n't"", 'beat', 'one', 'film', 'girls', 'everyone', 'was', 'cheering', 'over', 'were', 'so', 'creepy', 'one', 'literally', 'looked', 'porcelain', 'doll', 'So', 'when', 'Olive', 'routine', 'not', 'only', 'different', 'unique', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'thrilling', 'showed', 'alternate', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'way', 'go.Sometimes', 'thing', 'too', 'big', 'unfair', 'expectations', 'are', 'placed', 'massive', 'hype', 'film', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'got', 'walking', 'thinking', 'greatest', 'thing', 'ever', 'be', 'honest', ""'m"", 'one', 'few', 'who', 'hated', 'was', ""n't"", 'issue', 'so', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'nominated', 'even', 'wins', ""'d"", 'bet', 'dollars', 'fattening', 'Krispy', 'Kremes', 'words', 'overrated', 'will', 'be', 'thrown', 'loads', 'character', 'film', 'losers', 'when', ""'re"", 'scared', 'winning', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'trying', 'film', 'damnednest']",N/A

And, even more, I don't want to talk about the characters in this movie in much detail, although I am sure many others have.  I don't want to discuss the characters in detail because getting to know them individually and as one motley family is really the point of the whole exercise.The film has a terrific cast and each plays his or her role superbly.  Each makes a terrific contribution to the film, and given the special aspects of some of the characters, that is more of an achievement than you might at first expect.But how can I review this movie?  I think I describe what I took away from it (although you might take away very different things) and maybe offer you some suggestions of what to watch for as the story unfolds as you view the movie.  While the story is simple, it is exceedingly strange.  It might even disturb some to the point of turning it off.  Things are said that more crude than I remember ever being said in my family.  However, there are cruel things that are said in deep hurt that do ring true in their depth of pain if not in their specifics.What finally came from my exasperation with these characters is that they don't realize how much their own focus on what they need from outside of themselves to be happy is keeping them unhappy and keeps tripping them up.  Notice the difference in their individual happiness and joy as an extended family as they set aside these conditions and accept life for what it is offering at that moment.  One of them knows that all the way through the movie.  Notice her role in saving them even when they think it is the other way around.For those of you who avoid ""R"" rated movies, this has that rating because one member of the family stupidly uses drugs, there are some F-bombs and other profanities (but it doesn't swim in them), and there is a side issue with some porn magazines.

Here is a film that attempts to be dark, attempts to be charming, attempts to be edgy, attempts to be independent, and is yet drops the ball because in the end it has nothing cohesive to say.Olive Hoover (Abigail Breslin) is the cutest little kid in the world.  The kind of kid who just looks at the world with wide-eyed wonder.  She sweet even if the world around her isn't so.  Her Dad (Greg Kinnear) is a bad motivational speaker and an even worse role model, her mom (Toni Collette) is far to permissive, her brother (Paul Dano) hates his life and has taken a vow of silence, her grandpa (Alan Arkin) snorts heroin, and her Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell) has shown up on their doorstep after a botched attempt to take his own life.  This motley family is about to make a 700 mile trip in a beat up VW Van with a busted clutch to get Olive to the National Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest in Redondo Beach. Will they survive each other?  Or will Olive's dream of becoming a beauty queen come crashing down?LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is the kind of movie that will leaving you feeling good at the end only because it ends on such a high note.  The last ten minutes of this film are easily the best.  They're what you're going to talking about as you leave the theater.  As for the other 90 minutes well that's up in the air.The film is far to moody.  There is a fine line between dark humor and just plain darkness.  LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE spends too much of it early scenes developing realistic characters.  They laugh, they cry, and then the film betrays this honesty by asking them to fall into farce.  The screenplay goes into auto-pilot and the characters turn into independent film cliches'.The actors do the best they can with the material but alas the film feels so artificial.  You start to see some themes pop out that would make good talking points in an article or interview, but in the context of the film it's all just filler.  Every character gets to wax poetic then they get to do something silly.  Then the film makes some blanket statement about how life is as phony as a beauty contest, there is an act of rebellion, and then everybody hugs.The films biggest problem is that the screenplay is such a rip off of NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION.  Except instead of Wally World the Hoovers are on their way to Redondo Beach and there is a Proust scholar in the car.  There is even a scene in which a dead body shows up and they have to put it in their car.  I was waiting for Randy Quaid to show up and ask Greg Kinnear's character for money.  That's what this film needed Uncle Eddie.LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE is a ""dark comedy"" that's far too dark and not really all that funny.  It has it's moments, and on the surface  it is very sweet and charming.  Little Abigail Breslin steals the show, giving Olive a wisdom beyond her age, and a wide-eyed wonder.  But unfortunately the film is not worth the price of admission.  I'd skip this beauty contest.",2,"That's what this film needed, Uncle Eddie!",1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,3497,"['Just', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'film', 'LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE', 'was', 'leafing', 'copy', 'Douglas', 'Adam', 'final', 'anthology', 'writings', 'called', 'Salmon', 'Doubt', 'article', 'wrote', 'called', 'Turncoat', 'mused', 'wonder', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'comedy', 'days', 'everybody', 'comedian', 'even', 'weather', 'girls', 'laugh', 'everything', 'Not', 'intelligently', 'anymore', 'not', 'sudden', 'shock', 'astonishment', 'revelation', 'just', 'relentlessly', 'meaninglessly', 'movie', 'was', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'thought', 'head', 'Here', 'film', 'be', 'dark', 'attempts', 'be', 'charming', 'attempts', 'be', 'edgy', 'attempts', 'be', 'independent', 'yet', 'drops', 'ball', 'end', 'nothing', 'cohesive', 'say.Olive', 'Hoover', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'cutest', 'little', 'kid', 'world', 'kind', 'kid', 'who', 'just', 'world', 'wide-eyed', 'wonder', 'sweet', 'even', 'world', ""n't"", 'so', 'Dad', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'bad', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'even', 'worse', 'role', 'model', 'mom', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'far', 'permissive', 'brother', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'life', 'taken', 'vow', 'silence', 'grandpa', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'heroin', 'Uncle', 'Frank', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'shown', 'up', 'doorstep', 'botched', 'attempt', 'take', 'own', 'life', 'motley', 'family', 'make', '700', 'mile', 'trip', 'beat', 'up', 'VW', 'Van', 'busted', 'clutch', 'get', 'Olive', 'National', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'beauty', 'contest', 'Redondo', 'Beach', 'Will', 'survive', 'other', 'will', 'Olive', 'dream', 'becoming', 'beauty', 'queen', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE', 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'leaving', 'feeling', 'good', 'end', 'only', 'high', 'note', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'are', 'easily', 'best', ""'re"", 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'talking', 'leave', 'theater', 'other', '90', 'minutes', 'well', 'up', 'air.The', 'film', 'far', 'moody', 'fine', 'line', 'dark', 'humor', 'just', 'plain', 'darkness', 'LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE', 'too', 'much', 'early', 'scenes', 'developing', 'realistic', 'characters', 'laugh', 'cry', 'then', 'film', 'honesty', 'asking', 'fall', 'farce', 'screenplay', 'auto-pilot', 'characters', 'turn', 'independent', 'film', ""cliches'.The"", 'actors', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'material', 'film', 'feels', 'so', 'artificial', 'start', 'see', 'themes', 'pop', 'out', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'talking', 'points', 'article', 'interview', 'context', 'film', 'just', 'filler', 'character', 'wax', 'poetic', 'then', 'get', 'do', 'something', 'silly', 'Then', 'film', 'blanket', 'statement', 'how', 'life', 'as', 'phony', 'beauty', 'contest', 'act', 'rebellion', 'then', 'everybody', 'hugs.The', 'films', 'biggest', 'problem', 'screenplay', 'such', 'rip', 'NATIONAL', 'LAMPOON', 'VACATION', 'instead', 'Wally', 'World', 'Hoovers', 'are', 'way', 'Redondo', 'Beach', 'Proust', 'scholar', 'car', 'even', 'scene', 'dead', 'body', 'up', 'have', 'put', 'car', 'was', 'waiting', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'show', 'up', 'ask', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'character', 'money', 'what', 'film', 'needed', 'Uncle', 'Eddie.LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE', 'dark', 'comedy', 'far', 'too', 'dark', 'not', 'really', 'funny', 'moments', 'surface', 'very', 'sweet', 'charming', 'Little', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'show', 'giving', 'Olive', 'wisdom', 'age', 'wide-eyed', 'wonder', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'not', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', ""'d"", 'skip', 'beauty', 'contest']",N/A

The Hoovers are flawed individuals yet somehow cohere as a loving family unit.  ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a celebration of the differences that exist in pretty much all families but are afraid to admit it.  The film also succeeds as an indictment of the beauty pageant mentality that perpetuates the Jonbenet Ramsey syndrome that unfortunately exists in our society.  No film has skewered the beauty pageant culture so expertly since Michael Ritchie's ""Smile"" in 1975.  The cast is uniformly excellent but special citations should go to Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin.  Arkin, whose star rose in the sixties but has kind of waned in recent years, gives a cliche free performance as the drugtaking grandpa.  Breslin, as Olive, has the formidable chore of being the optimistic glue that holds the Hoover clan together.  The tender scene between Arkin and Breslin prior to the pageant is heart-rending.

That in the depths of despair we can find reasons to laugh, and in our supreme happiness we suddenly find ourselves on the verge of tears.

I believed every one of the reviews, which are brilliant in themselves, but I didn't find the movie at all the kind of film that informs and enlightens. I loved the comedy, the acting, the wild story line, the goofy antics and odd displays of maladjustment, but I didn't get the feeling that great truths were being explored. The grandfather character was played so well by Alan Arkin that I began immediately to say the big ""O"" word, Oscar. His every gesture and expression is the work of a master comic actor. About half way into the movie, I got tired, though, and after the grandfather dies, I lost interest in the film altogether. Frankly, I didn't like them very much and only cared about the old man. The silent son was interesting until he opened his mouth, and then he seemed very ordinary. The parents were awful, the road trip became terribly long, and the arrival scene in LA seemed suddenly too goofy, as they drove over the flower-beds and through gate posts, I really wondered where the police were and figured, as a life-long LA resident, that they would have been shot after 10 minutes of that kind of craziness.

In fact, it may not even be playing locally in your area. But even if you have to drive seven hundred miles in your broken VW Bug, and you have to push it half the way, it is well worth it. This is an alternately hilarious, dark, and poignant movie, that measures family values (everyone cheers on the under-dog daughter at the end) and dark, wildly innapropriate (but also uproarious) humor (the grandfather snorts heroin and reads porn magazines.Let me just say how good it is to see a suburban family whose home is in shambles, and who has to come up with an amount of money everyone can spend when they go to Denny's. In a movie like 'A History Of Violence', or I guess more commercially, 'Freaky Friday', the family's house is clean, prim and proper with nary a stray feather to be found. They usually have big dinners that the mother cooks, and the kids are usually perfect, as are the obligatory live-in relatives. In this movie, the house is such a mess that in an early scene, mother Sheryl (Toni Collette, doing a much different version of parenting than in 'The Night Listener') pushes chairs and kicks toys out of the way. She doesn't cook dinner. She brings home chicken and all of the side dishes that the restaurant includes. She throws together a salad, then throws some pops on the table for dessert. Hardly a cliche. But, the kids are not cliches either. The son, Frank (an expressive Paul Dano, and one would have to be when you're not talking) has taken a vow of silence because of, and I know I'm spelling this wrong, Fredrick Neichae. Their daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin) is not pretty by many peoples standards (although on a recent cover of Entertainment Weekly she looked better than she does here, which is a smart decision of the filmmakers to downplay her looks so that she doesn't look like every single other beauty pageant contestant.The title refers to the beauty pageant that Olive has placed in, and the plot revolves around the family driving to Rodondo Beach, California. Olive's father (it is never made clear if he is her real father, since references are made to Frank's father that Sheryl divorced, and Richard never treats Olive like his own) Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker who tells his kids that you shouldn't attempt anything if you don't think you'll win.

Loser!Then there is her brother Frank (Steve Carell) who has bandages on his wrists after trying to kill himself because his homosexual lover (one of his grad students) dumped him, the number one American authority on Marcel Proust, for his academic rival, the number two authority.  Pathetic!Next there is Grandpa (Alan Arkin) a randy nursing home reject who snorts heroin, has a potty mouth and complains a lot.  (Maybe he'll overdose!)Then there is her teenaged son Dwayne (Paul Dano) an antisocial loner who reads Nietzsche, hates everyone, and is on a vow of silence until he gets into flight training in the Air Force.  (Our children always disappoint us.  Sometimes we forgive them.)And finally there is Miss Sunshine herself, her daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) a little overweight, a little nerdy, not exactly a looker, who has entered the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant for little girls and is honing her dance routine following the pornographic advice of Grandpa.  Oh, boy!Credit Michael Arndt whose script won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for this lineup and for a wonderful and strikingly original comedic and satirical romp through dysfunctional land.  For reasons too complex to relate, the whole family piles into the Volkswagen bus and heads for Redondo Beach, California where the beauty pageant is being held.  Along the madcap way, the bus's clutch goes out, Grandpa suffers, shall we say, a major setback, Richard learns that the family finances are not going to work out, Frank gets the heartbreak rubbed in his face, and Dwayne finds out that his dream is not going to come true.  But can Olive win the pageant?The pageant itself is pretty funny with the girls in their plastic hairdos and their Tammy Faye makeup and their fake smiles pitted against the decidedly unglamourous but ever hopeful Olive Hoover.  Who will win?Alan Arkin won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and Abigail Breslin and the picture itself garnered Oscar nominations.  But see this for the writer.

This year it's Little Miss Sunshine, and the sun sure was shining on us today as we watched this one. I hate to say it, but this film has some tough competition in the categories where it's nominated. The best shot it has is Alan Arkin who plays ""Grandpa"". His breakaway scene is when he tells Olive Hoover, the heroine of our film played amazingly by the talented Abigail Breslin, how much he loves her, before locking himself in a hotel bathroom to sort Heroine, which subsequently kills him. The humor that enfolds as they steal his body to continue their trip to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in California reminds me of National Lampoon's but he's stuffed in the trunk rather than tied to the roof. This was only one of the several well-placed comedic scenes in this film. Arkin is up against some heavy hitters (see my last post on the jauggernaut that is Dreamgirls), and he has never won. Sorry, Al, but this isn't your year either.Against The Queen, Iwo Jima, and The Departed for Best Picture, it's difficult not to throw the levity of a feel good movie a bone by nominating in here, but we all know the record of comedic wins in this category. Far and few between.As an ensemble, it's a brilliant movie, but the Academy doesn't recognize ensembles, and that's too bad. Breslin was fine in this film and has a career, if she doesn't fall into the child star syndrome. Kinnear has been better, and I've never liked Toni Collette. She's ugly. My opinion. Yes, ugly. Uglier than Steve Buscemi. Sorry, but she was the scariest thing in Sixth Sense and since. Now let's talk about Paul Dando and Steve Carrell. Unless you've lived in a cave in Tibet during the last 18 months, you know Carrell, and he's wonderful here as the suicidal, out-of-work, gay professor uncle who is being babysat by his sister's family so he doesn't try to slit his wrists again. His stark white outfit fits well against the bright banana (or should I say sun?) color of the VW bus they need to push start everytime the stop somewhere. Dando plays well as Brelin's older brother whose 9-month vow of silence ends 3/5 of the way through the film.

When the local winner of the Little Miss Sunshine pageant is unable to attend the semifinals in California, the Hoover family takes a cross-country road trip in the family van, a trip that is full of humorous mishaps along the way.Arriving at the pageant, the mishaps continue. The woman in charge of the pageant takes an instant dislike to the Hoovers, who obviously do not fit the mold of the typical pageant family. Moreover, Olive is hardly in synch with the other seven-year-old cookie-cutter girls. Her performance, which turns out to be a form of burlesque (and which she learned from her grandfather), infuriates the woman in charge (as well as many of the parents in the audience). By now, however, we're all rooting for the Hoover family to get even with those who have put on the pageant. And they do--in a most dramatic and hilarious way.This is a great movie to watch if what you want to do is crash on your couch on a Friday night and get some real laughs, for there is nothing deep about it that requires close and careful attention.

1029434,ADKHI1TUGAX4,B000JU9OJ4,E. Anderson,"[2, 3]","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a delightful, quirky summer comedy starring Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear. Toni and Greg plays the married couple Sheryl and Richard. They are raising two children together Olive (Abigail Breslin) and Dwayne (Paul Dano). It is implied in the film but never really said for sure that Richard isn't the children's father. The film does make a brief mention that Sheryl is divorced. Alan Arkin is the irreprehensible but loveable foul-mouthed, heroin snorting grandfather who lives with the brood because he was kicked out of his retirement home. Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carrell) comes to live with the family after he is discharged from the mental institution after he had attempted suicide. This family puts the fun in dysfunctional with all their insecurities and other emotional issues that plagues them.The premise of the film has the entire family go on a road trip to California where Olive had been declared winner of a local beauty pagent by default and is one of the contestants for the final competition in Redondo, California. Most of the film revolves around the car trip. All of the family's neuroses comes to head. Everything that could go possibly go wrong on a car trip did go wrong for Sheryl and Richard.This was a terribly funny film and a lot of the credit goes to Alan Arkin as the heroin snorting grandpa who steals every scene he is in. Normally teenage angst in most films are over the top and so stereotypical but Paul Dano's performance as the Nietzsche-loving Dwayne was spot on. For most of the film, Dwayne was silent because he took a vow of silence until he achieved his goal. Despite his pessimistic view of his family, he still loved them. Steve Carrell was hilarious as Frank. I loved the scene where he matches wit with Richard in the VW van. Toni Collette was wonderful as Sheryl. She has quickly become of my favorite actresses. The films she choses to work in are impeccable and as Sheryl her performance certainly deserves to be recognized by the Golden Globes and/or the Oscars. Finally there is the irresistable Olive who is nothing more than a bundle of energy and is a real treat to watch in every scene. Her scenes in the last ten minutes of the film were hilarious.""Little Miss Sunshine"" is proof that summer films don't need special effects or big name actors. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" proves that all you really need is a really good script and actors who are able to stay true to form as the characters they embody.",5,A delightful summer movie,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,2492,"['Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'delightful', 'quirky', 'summer', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Toni', 'Greg', 'married', 'couple', 'Sheryl', 'Richard', 'are', 'raising', 'two', 'children', 'together', 'Olive', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Dwayne', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'implied', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'said', 'sure', 'Richard', ""n't"", 'children', 'father', 'film', 'make', 'brief', 'mention', 'Sheryl', 'divorced', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'irreprehensible', 'loveable', 'foul-mouthed', 'heroin', 'snorting', 'grandfather', 'who', 'brood', 'was', 'kicked', 'retirement', 'home', 'Sheryl', 'brother', 'Frank', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'live', 'family', 'discharged', 'mental', 'institution', 'had', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'family', 'fun', 'dysfunctional', 'insecurities', 'other', 'emotional', 'issues', 'them.The', 'premise', 'film', 'entire', 'family', 'go', 'road', 'trip', 'California', 'where', 'Olive', 'had', 'been', 'declared', 'winner', 'local', 'beauty', 'pagent', 'default', 'one', 'contestants', 'final', 'competition', 'Redondo', 'California', 'Most', 'film', 'car', 'trip', 'family', 'neuroses', 'head', 'Everything', 'could', 'go', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'car', 'trip', 'did', 'go', 'wrong', 'Sheryl', 'Richard.This', 'was', 'terribly', 'funny', 'film', 'lot', 'credit', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'heroin', 'snorting', 'grandpa', 'who', 'steals', 'scene', 'Normally', 'teenage', 'angst', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'top', 'so', 'stereotypical', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'performance', 'Nietzsche-loving', 'Dwayne', 'was', 'spot', 'most', 'film', 'Dwayne', 'was', 'silent', 'took', 'vow', 'silence', 'achieved', 'goal', 'pessimistic', 'view', 'family', 'still', 'loved', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Frank', 'loved', 'scene', 'where', 'wit', 'Richard', 'VW', 'van', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Sheryl', 'quickly', 'become', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'films', 'work', 'are', 'impeccable', 'Sheryl', 'performance', 'certainly', 'be', 'recognized', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Oscars', 'Finally', 'irresistable', 'Olive', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'bundle', 'energy', 'real', 'treat', 'watch', 'scene', 'scenes', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'were', 'hilarious', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'proof', 'summer', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'special', 'effects', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'really', 'need', 'really', 'good', 'script', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'stay', 'true', 'form', 'characters', 'embody']",N/A

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 2]","Every year has at least one quirky movie that really captures your heart and imagination, and in the year 2006, that little movie was ""Little Miss Sunshine.""Yes, it's another dark comedy about a quirky, dysfunctional family. But ""Little Miss Sunshine"" approaches the family dysfunction from a bizarre, smart, and sometimes slightly nuts perspective. This indie movie deserves all the credit that is being heaped on it -- it's truly glorious.Richard (Greg Kinnear) is an anxious motivational speaker who talks a lot about ""winners"" and ""losers,"" which is pretty funny when one considers that his family is full of oddities. His wife Sheryl (Toni Colette) is on edge as Richard inflicts his nine-step program on the family, and her Proust-scholar brother has just arrived, after a failed suicide attempt.And then there's little Olive (Abigail Breslin) -- she's wants to be in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, and is being coached by her outspoken, heroin-snorting grandfather. When she gets into the pageant, the family piles into a minibus to go to Redondo Beach. Unfortunately, the trip exposes all the problems they have -- death, disappointment, suicide and lost dreams. And a broken clutch.If you're going to make a dark comedy about a family, then for crying out loud, give it a heart. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" realizes this, in a little family world where a wordless hug speaks more than dozens of empty lines. These people drive each other crazy, don't ever communicate, but they really do love each other -- yes, even foulmouthed Grandpa.But lest anyone think it's syrupy, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris wrap it in a wicked cocoon of clever humor. ""Sarcasm is the refuge of losers,"" Richard says smugly, only to receive a sarcastic ""REALLY?"" He's not the only one: each character has his or her own odd spots, and a unique way of expressing it. (""High school's your prime suffering years! You don't get better suffering than that!"").And while a road trip sounds dull, Dayton and Faris drop little incidents through it that keep it fresh, even if it's just hiccups from the horn. The climax of the strangeness is the ""Fawlty Towers""esque smuggling of a dead body, and a truly surreal song-and-dance sequence. It has to score a 9.5 on the ""bizarre endings"" scale.Abigail Breslin is a simply brilliant little actress -- cute, yet not cutesy -- and she tends to fill up the screen with her natural appeal. The other actors wear their parts like comfy old sweaters, such as Colette's weary mother and her business-obsessed hubby, not to mention Alan Arkin's priceless turn as the drug-snorting patriarch.""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a comedy as dark as it is funny, but somehow it never becomes depressing.

It's a charmer written by first-time screenwriter Michael Arndt about a dysfunctional family that you end up liking in spite of how they often act. Co-directed by the husband and wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, this uproarious comedy obviously benefits from both perspectives in balancing the satirical elements with the subtleties of the character arcs in the Hoover family as we follow them in their dilapidated Volkswagen van.The plot revolves around seven-year old Olive, who finds out that she is a finalist in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant to be held in Redondo Beach, California in two days. Her father Richard is a motivational speaker who wants the world to think he is the next Tony Robbins. Her grandfather has been thrown out of his retirement home for shouting expletives and snorting heroin. Her brother Dwayne reads Nietzsche and has taken a vow of silence until he gets accepted for flight training into the Air Force Academy. Her Uncle Frank, a gay academic expert at Proust, has just been released from a hospital after trying to commit suicide over his lover's abandonment. Her no-nonsense mother Sheryl tries to hold the family together through sheer will but often finds herself lost under the strained circumstances.Eerie visions of JonBenet Ramsey will come back to you when you see the pageant climax itself but not before the actors inject a great deal of humanity into their performances. Reunited after playing a divorcing couple in 2001's ""Dinner with Friends"", Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette show their expertise in portraying a marriage in trouble. With a wariness corrupting his usual preppy veneer, Kinnear brings out the nasty edge of a resentful man unable to fulfill his ambitions. Collette continues to impress with her unique combination of sharp intelligence and visceral emotionalism. As Frank, Steve Carell shows a surprising ability for gravitas that his Frat Pack cronies have not yet exhibited. Veteran actor Alan Arkin is a welcome presence as Grandpa, and looking appropriately Goth-like, Paul Dano is hilariously dead-eyed as Dwayne.Abigail Breslin is an unaffected joy as Olive, and she makes the most of the talent competition in the film's most winning moments. There are also memorable bits from Paula Newsome as a curt grief counselor; Beth Grant as a snippy, bouffant-headed pageant official; and Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe from ""24"") showing her trademark perturbed look as a contest assistant.

This was one of the most disappointing times of my movie viewing year. For the past 12 months, in my circles, I have heard nothing but praise and accolades for 'Little Miss Sunshine'. These accolades coming from 11 year old girls to 80 year old men, to film school students who praise this as a hidden gem of 'raw-art-situational comedy'. Everyone telling me in every way imaginable, ""Oh Ken you have to see this movie. It's so amazing. It speaks to so many people on so many different avenues."" Hmmm, clearly I am driving on an isolationist freeway.While there were tender moments (Paul Dano (L.I.E.) talking with the gay Steve C. (Dan in Real Life) on the docks about doing what you want to do and screwing morals and society's judgements), I seemed to be wondering when in fact the movie would become something of importance or interest. It failed on all fronts to move me to understand it's purpose, albeit trying to be hilariously funny. While the opening scenes point to a storyline with depth and tender emotions, (save the regurgated use of the word cliche) it guts what little it can delve out, with unwitty righteous ensemble displays of earnest and ill will towards Alan Arkin trying desperately to be comedic. On a sidenote, Paul Dano has intense potential, despite anyone with a pulse being able to play his roll as the quiet, isolated teenage son, he comes through when he breaks his silence with his outburst in the suburbian field, and like Jamie Bell (UnderTow, Billy Elliott) he is not afraid to take on roles which clearly shows the depth of his craft as his performances are dynamic, intriguing, diverse and controversial. We should watch his career with great intrigue.Uniformly, LMS falls on almost every attempt to try almost effortlessly to shine as an art-house indie flick with that sub-genre of psuedo-intellectuals who think films like these are progressively artistic in their endeavors to speak to everyone in some way. In fact it can't seem to find solid ground, save Alan Arkin who's incessant use of the F word was uncalled for in its excess. I am sheltered in believing that this little film was to be a shining, roving example of what is lacking in Hollywood, and how a low budget movie can bring momentum to an often saturated industry filled with massive CGI mega blockbusters and B Movie straight to DVD trash.

1029446,A8BSESXVUCJV2,B000JU9OJ4,F. Bluhm,"[9, 19]","Anyone who watched the Academy Awards this year must have noticed the look of surprise on Alan Arkin's face when he heard his name called as the winner of the Best Supporting Actor award. After watching the movie, I would feel safe in saying that his reaction was, perhaps, more one of embarrassment than surprise. One can only imagine what Djimon Hounson, Eddie Murphy and Mark Wahlberg must have been thinking - not to mention the rest of the audience. As great an actor as he is, I felt Arkin spent far too little time in this film to be singled out for any serious Osar consideration. Perhaps if anyone (or anything) in this film deserved to be nominated, it should have been the bus!That said, I personally found the film to be too slow-paced and rather boring - which, for the most part, matches the performances as well. The scrip was bland and couldn't hold my attention; twice while watching the film, I considered turning it off. However, considering all the buzz that surrounded it, I decided to follow it through. In the end, I found myself asking, 'so what was all the fuss about?' I also found it hard to believe that this film had been nominated for best picture.For an independent film to gather this much talent together and not produce a better product was a terrible waste. I find it hard to believe that it was nominated for anything, considering the level of competition it was up against. By the way, if you really want to see a great example of a performance by a best supporting actor,  watch ""Sunshine's"" Greg Kinnear in ""As Good As It Gets."" It doesn't get any better than that. Kinnear was nominated for his performance, but, like the film's great writer-director, James L. Brooks, he was snubbed by Oscar that year. Snubbed this year were nominees for best original screenplay such as the writers of ""Babel,"" ""Letters from Iwo Jima,"" and ""The Queen."" ""Sunshine"" won the oscar for that category, too.

1029448,A73DFWJE0CGY6,B000JU9OJ4,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[3, 5]","This movie is a chaotic, unqualified joy.It's comforting to think that such a family exists. A dysfunctional, eccentric collection of absolute individuals unites, however reluctantly at times, in support of the one nearly-normal member of the family, an irrepressible seven-year-old girl who wants to enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. This is not your typical little beauty queen, the miniature adults one sees made up in glittery fluff on parade in front of adoring adults living vicariously off the hype; this is a normal-looking, apparently happy little girl who recognizes her family's various oddities and accepts them as they are - as they all ultimately come to do themselves.The cast is outstanding. Greg Kinnear, always a joy, plays the father convinced of his own ability to sell a how-to video on getting where you want to be in the world by being a winner (""There are two types of people - winners and losers"") and who has imbued his daughter with this philosophy. His view is taken with a grain of salt by every other member of the family; the at-wit's-end mother (Toni Collette, another great performance) who is pretty much singlehandedly holding the fort; Grandpa (Alan Arkin, who has made a life's work of memorable quirky roles and this is no exception) who has taken it upon himself to coach his granddaughter on the talent part of her beauty-pageant performance - woefully left to his own devices by her parents, who are lost in their own problems, and who in retrospect should have been paying more close attention to details - and who is an unashamed and unapologetically vulgar old sod who was kicked out of his quarters in elderly housing for heroin use, but who clearly loves the little girl; the older malcontent teenaged brother of the girl, who has taken a vow of silence until he graduates high school and can enter flight school; the mother's brother, Uncle Frank (Steve Carell - this guy is everywhere lately), a professor of Proust, openly gay and battling his own demons, who has joined the family due to a recent suicide attempt; and the little girl herself, winningly played by Abigail Breslin and stuck with the less-than-childlike name of Olive (no slur on the Olives out there; just thought it a singularly weighty nomer for a seven-year-old, but as she has the best outlook of all of them, perhaps that's the point).The family in toto embarks on an expedition to Redondo Beach from Albuquerque in an elderly VW bus that mirrors the overall quirks of its owners; the horn sticks, the clutch gives out; and the family each deals with their own problems. It is a study in the fact that each person's personal trauma is supreme to themselves, if to no one else; though a problem might seem unimportant to all other members of a group, it is insurmountable to the person involved.

However, it's certainly not for the kids (though I'll be honest, our seven and nine-year olds run around repeating grandpa's lines, and we don't care).You shouldn't watch this if you like to sugar-coat your life.  That's to say, you like everything ""perfect"".  No drugs, sex-related talk, alcohol, cussing, or anything like that.  Well, Little Miss Sunshine deals with reality and how a family who accepts it (or is too tired to fight it) handles it.The story's very simple, so simple it's such an achievement.  It shows the Hoover family of six.Richard's the father who's trying to become a successful self-help instructor.  In the beginning, he's mostly annoying for the simple fact that he's increadibly judgemental, but he comes around and faces life not too long into the movie.Sheryl's the wife and mother, who works a steady job and is probably the most normal-functioning member of the family besides Olive.  She's fairly depressed about the financial stituation they're in, and it plays out on the road.Frank's the gay brother of Sheryl, who's just failed a scuicide attempt after a failed relationship.  Frank suffers a lot at the hands of Richard in the beginning, with Richard's attitude ranknig Frank as a ""loser"", but that changes after the death of grandpa.Dwayne's a fifteen-year-old from a previous marriage of Sheryl's.  He's determined to become a test pilot, and has taken a vow of silence till he reaches that goal, though it hits a screeching halt.Olive's seven, and is obsessed with competitions.  She's the only one who actually has any normality (though very little of it) when they get to the competition.Grandpa dies not long into the movie, but he's also perhaps the funniest, so that's a real shame.  He got evicted from a rest home after he started snorting heroin.That's basically it.

However, the movie, upon later reflection, seems also to show - and essentially condone - a number of what I would call immoral & irresponsible behaviors: using illegal drugs (in old age at least), corrupting the morals of minors, encouraging lewd dancing of children, reckless driving and other law breaking, and destruction of private property - most of it just to get their prepubescent and overweight little girl to a beauty contest. One can argue that this movie is, in fact, corrupt and immoral precisely because it camouflages a lot of illicit behavior under a lot of sentimental interfamily caring. Not that all film action by good characters has always got to be good and decent, but evidently, long gone are the days when Hollywood is able to display the same important meme of family caring without the hip baggage of illicit and irresponsible behavior - its just too easy with it to make humorous scenes.

As opposed to some of the movies of the recent past (Borat, American Pie, Waiting, the National Lampoon endless series, etc) LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE  starts with a smart script by Michael Arndt that addresses many of the highly dysfunctional family elements present in today's society and allows us to hold a few mirrors up to our own vaguely warped view of good and bad, right and wrong, ambition and self destructive delusion and makes us laugh - at times embarrassed, at times just having fun!Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris direct this odd little story of a family in Albuquerque, NM, a family comprised of a grandfather (Alan Arkin) whose 'elderly status' allows him to speak inappropriately grossly and frankly to his grandchildren while snorting coke in the bathroom; a father (Greg Kinnear, who just gets better and better) with a motivational program scheme that is melting toward failure; a mother (the extraordinary Toni Collette) who attempts to cope with her role as the matriarch of this weird group; the mother's brother (Steve Carell), a gay Proustian scholar who has just lost his job over an affair with a grad student and has survived an unsuccessful suicide attempt; a space-cadet teenage son (Paul Dano) who is in a vow of silence as he pursues Nietzsche and extracting promises for his future from his intimidated parents; and last, but most important, a chubby little sister Olive (Abigail Breslin) who dotes on Miss America pageant reruns on TV and longs to tryout for the Little Miss Sunshine beauty/talent show for little girls in Southern California.The bulk of the film is a road trip which confines this very strange family in an RUV headed for the only bit of positive hope for change in Olive's ploy to become Little Miss Sunshine.  Along the trip we get to know these oddballs personally and in the end the results of the family effort competition seem almost secondary to the fun of getting there.  Each of the performers is at peak form in acting and the direction and pacing would be difficult to improve.

The mother says the grandfather (Alan Arkin) snorts heroin. Thing is, you can't SNORT heroin. He's clearly doing cocaine. Next, the third act at the pagent really gives off vibes of pedophillia.

Then on, it is really the discomfort between the characters that helps the storyline proceed.I felt there was a slight miscasting since Greg Kinnear made me want to sock him in the eye. I mean, his character was quite interesting but there is this one dimensional ""80's hangover"" look on his face that doesnt do much to bring out the unpredictability of the film. Not in one scene did I feel surprised at what his character does. Maybe it's just me but please, how can someone with the same haircut (since As Good As It Gets..) get the particular role. I do understand this was a low budget film with limited aspirations but...Alan Arkin (grandpa) has a short yet mutilatingly effect cameo. His dialogues are to the point and hilarious, his quotes are unforgettable. I carried one with me after the movie ended. ""A real loser is someone who's so afraid of not winning he doesn't even try.""Coming to my favourite character, Steve Carell was very good. He seems to lend the film more purpose. His run is funny, his silent un-accusing looks, his way of hiding himself from his love, the fact that he plays someone gay so nonchalantly, his scenes with the character Dwayne and the grandfather were quite funny. He has this guilty look on his face as if he's an escaped convict of some sort. Funny.Paul Dano (the 15 year old kid) is actually 23 and his character was very interesting as well. My favourite scene in the film involves him and Olive in a ditch while the bus has stopped. He speaks in that scene.Overall, I feel Little Miss Sunshine deserves three stars because of how it doesn't dig deeper into issues it dramatizes. It doesn't have a huge scope and there is no one single OUTSTANDING performance. Paul Dano could have had a better role.The last scene is absolutely HILARIOUS, though.",3,"Above Average.

Teysko ""heatherteyskodotcom""","[8, 11]","My husband and I watched this movie after my dad sent it to us labeling it a ""have to watch as soon as possible"" movie.  So we watched it right away, and it didn't disappoint.  We will probably be watching several times over again for years.  We cried, we laughed, we cried some more, and we laughed a lot.  And I screamed out of embarrassment during a pageant scene, which I won't mention, because the plot kind of revolves around it.Yeah, there's a lot of language, and it's not supposed to be a kid's movie.  I don't think the language was gratuitous - it fit the characters.  There are plenty of kids movies out this holiday season already.  Just because this movie is about a family doesn't mean that you should take your whole family (especially the little ones) to see it.This movie is raw and emotional.  The tension in Richard and Sheryl's marriage was almost unbearable.  You could tell that both of them wanted to do what was right to take care of their family, but they just had wildly opposite ways of getting there, and they didn't have the communication tools to actually talk about things, so instead they just shouted.  Actually, Richard pretty much shouts at everyone.  The irony of him being a self-help author is poignant.  Grandpa swears, is practically obsessed with sex, and snorts heroine, as others have mentioned.  But he was also in WWII, so I figure he earned the right to do just about anything he wants.  The family seems to think so too.The best part is, as others have mentioned, the fact that this functionally dysfunctional family was able to come together to support each other when they need to, and the love and acceptance that they ultimately give each other.I can't say enough good things about this movie.

This over-the-top family travels in a VW van, in a laugh-a-minute trip that turns William Faulkner's novel AS I LAY DYING on its head.This movie spoofs a lot of things about America, not the least of which are those beauty pageants for toddlers and children.

'Story' is a non-fictional book that teaches the art of writing novels, short stories, & screenplays.  In this book Michael would learn why his movie failed on so many levels.You see, Michael thought that charaters are the most important element in story telling.  Michael thought all he had to do was develop some interesting and flawed characters.  Michael thought the plot was something that other writers worried themselves about - but his plot would be an organic byproduct of some quirky honest dialogue.  The scenes in this movie serve no purpose but to put his characters in the same space.  The scene where Frank (Steve Carrell) just happens to run into the man he most loves and the man who ruined his life at a gas station purchasing porn - this scene serves no purpose.  I certainly didn't learn anything new or interesting about Frank during that scene.The moral of the movie seems to be that Olive and everyone should ""(forget) about beauty contests"".

But something is missing, making the movie less than the sum of its parts.The story concerns Olive Hoover, a pudgy, bespectacled 10-year old who dreams of being a beauty queen. She has no chance in the world until the winner of a contest (in which Olive placed second) loses her crown. Suddenly, Olive has a shot at the Little Miss Sunshine crown - if only her dysfunctional family can get its act together and help her get to the contest!LMS is another in a long line of ""funny"" movies about dysfunctional families. But this one inexpertly negotiates the fine line between crazy people being funny and crazy people being weird, mean or dangerous. Grandpa is a porn-addicted coker. Uncle tried slit his wrists - a very unfunny way to do oneself in. Brother is a Nietzsche freak who hates everyone and has taken a vow of silence. Dad is desperate to sell his pathetic self-help regimen. Only Mom is half-way sane, though how she keeps up with this gang of misfits is anyone's guess. In the hands of an accomplished writer, this might have worked, as it did every week for the writers of ""Malcolm in the Middle."" But with LMS I found myself alternately horrified for or horrified by the cruelty and pathetic weirdness of this bunch.I also found that the movie misfired in its attempt to satirize pre-pubescent beauty pageants. In post-Jon Benet America, the sight of people dressing their young daughters as sexy starlets is more than a little creepy.There was a very human and very funny movie lurking inside LMS.

What on the surface appears to be a dark road comedy about a dysfunctional family, is at its a heart a celebration of what makes a family.The Hoover Family has its share of problems and appears to be barely scraping by, but when word from relatives comes that their youngest, Olive, has qualified as a semi-finalist in a beauty pageant, the family sets out to California in a VW bus.  From the film's opening moments, with the memorable, poignant score and the dad (played by the underrated Kinnear) giving a motivational speech to a small, nearly empty room on his ""9 Steps"" to becoming a ""winner,"" it's obvious ""Little Miss Sunshine"" could be something special.To go into the details of each of the characters would be redundant, as most other reviews here seem to have that covered, but it's important to note that the entire cast shines.  Nobody's phoning it in here; the performances are heartfelt and genuine, and you'll find yourself caring about each member of the Hoover Family.  This is essential because much of the comedy stems from the characters and the dialogue.  Even the occassional moment of physical comedy (the way Carrell's character runs, for example), is subtle and character-based, and for that matter, effective.  Each character gets their moment in the sun, and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is filled with memorable moments because of it.  Every scene in the movie doesn't just advance the plot or makes us laugh, it also reveals the nature of the characters.""Little Miss Sunshine"" knows that most vacations don't turn out how you imagine, and that there are bound to be mishaps along the way--the car that breaks down, the run-ins with local authorities.  It's also wise enough to know that those mishaps are the moments you'll look back on with your family and laugh about, perhaps even cherish.It all builds to one of the most rewarding and enjoyable payoffs in recent years.  This is a truly heartwarming movie that manages to charm and convey its message using dark humor and adult honesty, instead of through the sappiness or Hallmark sentiments of most Hollywood products. I haven't seen all the big films of 2006 (such as Babel, Letters from Iwo Jima, or Pan's Labyrinth), but ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is one of those true crowd pleasers that appeal to both low and high brow audiences, and it's one of those movies that gets better with each viewing.

After about 30 minutes, one of them commented, ""Is this suppose to be a comedy?"" That's pretty much the feeling for the first half of the film, but once the characters are established, the viewer is set up for one of the most charming displays of a family bonding ever in a film.The family is extremely messed up. It felt like we were visiting a home where we were seeing things that we shouldn't be seeing. It was painful and compelling at the same time because you could tell that everyone cared for each other very much but all their personal BS was getting in the way of them making healthy connections to each other.After watching this I thought it was very funny and thought-provoking film. Toni Collette and Greg Kinnear are totally believable and utterly great as the struggling couple, trying their best to keep themselves going for the sake of their determined daughter. Abigail Breslin is adorable and perfect in the role of Olive, and does all the right things to make us really love her as if she were our own sister or daughter. Steve Carrell and Alan Arkin deliver subtle yet wonderful performances as well, though I wish Arkin had more screen time (this was the film's only lacking point). Paul Dano was absolutely spot-on with his portrayal of Duane; his ""leave me here scene"" had me feeling so empathetic it was almost too real and too close to home (a sign of pure brilliance in his performance, the script and direction).The whole film feels like something snatched right out of the most bizarre area of reality, good visuals, lovable characters, and a script that never fails to be entertaining.

They seemed over-hyped, overly dramatic, a bit too crazy and one in particular, a bit too vular and crude for me to enjoy it.I still wanted to try to enjoy the film, but to me, there wasn't much of a plot. It was basic, which may be nice, but again, the dysfunctional family didn't help, and to me, the humor wasn't really there either.Weather it was a comedy or drama, it didn't matter. It didn't do anything for me.It's hard to like a film when you can't stand the cast. I don't think there was anyone I could put up with.

1029485,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B000JU9OJ4,JGC,"[0, 0]","""Little Miss Sunshine"" is the story of the Hoover Family. Olive (played by the adorable and very funny Abigail Breslin) has just been accepted into the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" beauty pageant (because of a cancellation) and her family decides to drive through three states so she can make the competition on time. Richard Hoover (played by former Talk Soup host, Greg Kinnear) is Oliver's dad who believes that winning is number one. When Richard tells poor Olive that she shouldn't eat ice-cream (because there aren't any fat Miss America contestants) I thought it was both extremely funny and also equally sad.Paul Dano played Olive's (very comical) morbidly hate-filled brother, Dwayne. Alan Arkin played the coke-snorting, sex-crazy grandfather. Toni Collette was the kids' mom Sheryl; it was obvious that Sheryl was wrapped way too tight but she really did love her family. And rounding out this ensemble cast is Uncle Frank (played by ""Forty Year Old Virgin"" star Steve Carell.) Frank came to stay with Sheryl and her family after he recently tried to commit suicide after his homosexual love of interest rejected him.So the family embarks on a car trip across NV, AZ, and CA in a broken down, old 70's bus (they have to push it to get it started!)There are so many funny moments in this picture. It was also touching to see Olive put her head on her brother's shoulder to try to cheer him up, and I did suspect at that moment that Dwayne actually didn't hate everyone because he seemed so sensitive.Anyone that watches this picture will certainly agree that Olive's dance routine was the hit of the entire movie. Olive dances to the tune of the Rick James hit ""Super Freak"" while prudish Pageant Official Jenkins (played perfectly by one-time ""Malcolm In The Middle"" star Beth Grant) goes absolutely BERSERK! I don't want to give anything away, but the entire family was involved, a huge scene resulted, and the police were even called!After watching the first thirty minutes of this movie I thought to myself, ""why are these people all together..."" ...But I suppose family is whatever you make of it and the Hoover family must have really loved each other to go through all they did and still stay together. Maybe they don't make the same decisions as the ""traditional American family"" but that's ok because they still find their own happiness.I reluctantly went to go see this movie after a friend told me how good it was. I protested because it looked totally ridiculous but my friend had already seen it and he insisted that it was a superior picture. And I am so glad that I went because this was one of the best movies I have seen in months.

They are, in essence, a group of individuals dealing with enormous personal problems, yet joined in their love for little Olive and their desire to see her perform in a competition that's the highlight of her short life.Naturally, the trip is rife with problems from the moment the family hits the highway -- their ancient VW Bus starts breaking down in the middle of nowhere; Grandpa takes an overdose in a hotel room; and father Richard (Greg Kinnear) learns that the business deal he had quit his job in hopes of landing has bust.To make matters worse, the lively Olive is hardly a stereotypical pageant contestant.

He's trying to swing a book deal, or turn his so-far one-man show into something spectacular. We are never told what he left behind to pursue his ""dream"", but that's really not important.Frank, the mother's brother, (Steve Carell) is the country's preeminent Proust scholar who recently tried to kill himself for a number of reasons, all entertainingly told over dinner. He's gay, as is the 2nd (according to him) most prominent Proust scholar.Kinnear's father, known only as Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is a foul mouthed heroin user who was kicked out of an assisted living home. We soon learn why - other than the heroin use - when giving advice to his grandson about having as much sex as he possibly can while he's young and it's still legal to have sex with teenage girls. There's a screw or two loose there.The son, Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a fanatical devotee of Nietzsche and has taken a vow of silence until he joins the air force and flies a plane. He communicates through writing on a pad, and claims to hate everyone. He wears, at one point, a T-shirt that says ""Jesus was Wrong"". Hysterical.The daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin), an adorable young girl has fantasies of winning the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Unfortunately, she's only adorable - and adorable isn't beauty pageant material. Still, this is her dream, and her family supports her enough to throw themselves in their VW van and drive hundreds of miles to get her into the pageant.The mother, Sheryl (Toni Collete) is the necessary straight character, and certainly the sanest of the bunch. Her presence holds everyone together.With a cast of characters like this, it's impossible for a fantastic voyage not to occur. And it does. From the van breaking down so that it can only be started by everyone getting out and pushing to an improbable hospital escape, the adventure is a lively one.The beauty pageant itself is extremely disturbing. I've never felt comfortable watching 8 year old girls preen about as adult women. To my sensibilities, it's the parent living vicariously through the daughter - most of the time, at least. I'm sure - like Olive - that some have dreams of their own. For those that don't, shame on the parent.Olive stands out, nearly literally, as a very sore thumb at the pageant. She does not have the makeup, the hair, the moves, or the skinny body to compete. That doesn't stop us from rooting for her. We have to, because she's easily the most endearing character in the film. We also feel tremendous pity for her, knowing that she just doesn't measure up to these other girls. Which, in itself, is sad. It's very likely that she more than measures up to them in terms of quality.Olive's dance presentation, the final of the evening, is hysterical.

For example ""The Daily Show"" alum Steve Carell plays the uncle recovering from a suicide attempt, although it was such a different role for him I didn't even realize it was him until halfway through the movie.Although it might be tempting to describe this as a movie about real people with real problems, the hand of Hollywood exaggeration is at play here. The way this family just experiences one huge problem after another is a bit over the top, and probably puts this film more in the category of ""Worst vacation ever/Road trip disaster"" films (like ""National Lampoon's Vacation"", ""Planes, trains, Automobiles"", ""Road Trip"", etc, etc, etc) than a family drama.Not that I'm complaining mind you. I've seen a few films that tried to imidate real life, and they bored the pants off of me. I think most of us go into movies if not for pure escapism, than at least to watch people with far more interesting or screwed up lives than our own.I don't know how accurate the scene of the child beauty pagent was in this movie.

A dysfunctional set of family members living in their own separate private hells is forced together to deliver Olive, the 6 year old daughter, to a 'Little Miss Sunshine beauty and talent show'.The meta-narrative running through the movie is the American obsession with winning together with the pathological contempt and lack of compassion that many Americans show for losers... Paradoxically, the film shows that a loser is really someone who has denied their own heart...In the midst of this dysfunctionality is one bright spot - Olive's innocence, guile, trust and lovingness that bring child's realness and love to the family. Everyone seems to somehow suspect that Olive is their only link to sanity. When it really matters, the family pulls itself together around this shared love and defends it against what can truly be described as horrific pathological expression of adult narcissism: a beauty pageant for little kids.

Olive's dream is to become a beauty queen and the opening scene shows her watching a beauty pageant and imitating the winner. Her grandfather has been helping her to rehearse her talent routine and she practices daily. They can't afford to fly to California, and due to circumstances, they all must go together in the VW bus to California.The father, Richard (played by Greg Kinnear) is the inventor of a ""9 Step Program"" on being a ""winner"" and his opinions on avoiding loserdom are quite funny. He is suave, tanned, and styled out like a typical ""motivational speaker"".Dwayne (the brother) doesn't speak (by choice) and reads philosophy. He hates everyone. He hasn't spoken in 9 months. He wants to be a pilot, and his mother bribes him to go on the trip by promising to allow him to go to flight school.Sheryl, the mother, is a divorcee - Olive and Dwayne are not Richards children. She appears to be the glue that holds everyone together.The Grandpa is hysterical. He has many vices all of which add a lot of humor to the picture. He is Olive's ""coach"" for her beauty pageant.Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carell) is there as well - after a failed suicide attempt he must live with Sheryl and her family, and can't be left alone, so he's also along for the ride.Okay, so mix all these people up with their problems, and the movie is an absolute trip. Many things happen along the way that could be construed as negative - but overall, the movie, to me, had a positive vibe. You see, Olive is not a beauty queen. She is a plain girl, with a bit of a belly and big bucked teeth. In reality she has no chance in a beauty pageant - but her family, even with all of their problems never tells Olive that she can't do it.In reality most families under stress (to put it lightly...) would simply skip the 800-mile, 2-day trek that they can't really afford, and simply tell their child, ""Sorry honey, you really don't have a chance at winning and we can't afford it, so you don't get to be in the beauty pageant"".Not this family.

1029502,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000JU9OJ4,Kaya Savas,"[1, 2]","MOVIE: There has been a lot of garbage out in the theaters so far this year. The only movies I can list that I truly found to be great were United 93, DaVinci Code, Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, and now Little Miss Sunshine. This is one of the best films of the year, and the first movie that deserves some attention from Oscar voters. The story is about a family who takes a road trip to enter their daughter into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. We start the story and our ensamble cast is introduced one by one. We have Richard the overcontroling father, Sheryl the loving mother, their foul mouthed grandpa, the rebel son, Frank the suicidal homosexual genius uncle, and little Olive. I could spend a long time just describing the brilliance of each character and what they all mean to the plot, but that would take awhile. So, now this dysfunctional family goes on a roadtrip to California so that their daughter can enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. What follows is a heartwarming, emotional, and hilarious journey. Each character finds their own personal journey through Olive. Olive is the center of the film that holds the family together. The film isn't called Little Miss Sunshine beacause of the beauty pageant, it's because of Olive. This sweet innocent girl has no idea of the world around her, and no idea that she is the center of the family. A great scene in the film has Dwayne, the rebel son, refusing to get off the side of the road and continue with the trip even though everyone else is trying to comfort him into getting back in the car. Then his sister comes and rests her hand on his shoulder, he looks up at her, gets up and carries her back to the car. The film addresses many of life's problems and basically shows how it's all one big beauty pageant, but of course beauty doesn't matter at all. The only complaint I had about the film, which constitutes it's 3.5 stars, was the ending. I can't really say anything without ruining it, but let's just say it left a lot to be desired. I felt like the story deserved a more complete resolution versus what we were given.ACTING: The film is filled with an incredible cast, and I mean incredible. Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Paul Dano, Steve Carell, and Abigail Breslin all give outstanding performances. Steve Carell is an amazing actor and I really feel like he's going to get nominated for his role here. The film is truly something special and the script definately calls for an ensamble, which they deliver.BOTTOM LINE: Right now I am calling nominations for Steve Carell and Michael Arndt's amazing screenplay. Who new that this first time screenwriter would produce such a rich script. You also have to acknowledge the superb directing from real life married couple, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris.

Norman ""li'l rock & roller""","[2, 3]","At the beginning of ""Little Miss Sunshine"", everyone seems to be floating in a kind of Proustian soup--a fact marked by the screenwriters when they make one of the ensemble cast, Frank,who has just lost his lover and attempted suicide ""the world's #1 Proust scholar"".  The three adult male members--Frank, the uncle (Steve Carell), father Richard (Greg Kinnear), and Richard's father (Alan Arkin, ""Grandpa""), come at us with eyes full of a sense of a life somehow gone off the track, much as little Olive, the title character, bounces cheerily in with eyes full of hope and dreams.  Paul Dano, as teenage Dwayne, in a vow of silence that allows his character to play the tortured adolescent brilliantly by showing no affect whatsoever and through scribbled notes like ""Welcome to Hell"" and ""Please don't kill yourself tonight"", still hangs on to two dreams--getting away from his family, and being a test pilot for the Air Force. Mom Sheryl (Toni Colette), quirky in her own way, (""Olive, you can be fat or thin, whichever you want,"") is the glue that seems to hold this bunch together.When Olive gets a chance to participate in the finals of a beauty contest in another state, the  family  pack up in the yellow VW van.  On the way, dad keeps in touch with the guru who's supposed to get his first book off the ground, of which he told mom ""This is it,"" an apparent promise to get his office out of her kitchen.  He excitedly shares his ""9 Step"" self help program to everyone.  Grandpa, who has been helping Olive with the ""talent"" part of her performance, sneaks into the bathroom to snort some of the cocaine that got him kicked out of the retirement home and into the Hoovers' household.  Frank seems to be growing comfortable with this quirky family of his sister's, particularly Dwayne.But before they reach the Redondo Beach hotel where the pageant takes place, losses or the poignant memories knock the wind out of each of the yellow, sunshiny bus's passengers. Painful (and expensive) as these problems threaten to be, no one suggests turning back.Once in Redondo Beach, afraid the pageant is not for Olive, they are tempted to ""protect"" her from her own dream.  After all, they've all just been a little bruised, they don't want her to feel such pain. But instead, they find a way to temper the consequences of living those dreams out, a little.  In doing so, they craft a last scene  full of all the comedic command of Greg Kinnear, Steve Carell, an up and coming little Abigail Breslin,  other members of this stupendous cast, and a certain funky number by the late Rick James.*********DVD EXTRASThis DVD is worthwhile in that the directors' and writers' comments are helpful in understanding the film.  I'm surprised to hear, for example, that the directors thought the scene with Frank (Steve Carell) in the convenience store (no spoilers, sorry) would be funny.  It will break your heart--as will the one scene where Dwayne does become emotional.The camera technique used by having a camera in the back and front of the bus (and several different busses) gave more of a sense of what the crew and cast were going through on this low-budget film: clearly a labor of love.Don't get too excited over the 4 alternate endings.  1 of them is Abigail Breslin's (Olive)  ending, ""with Abigail Breslin directing"" and you can pretty much guess the 2 minute ending she would have liked.

Gelwasser,"[1, 4]","In this era of big money, Hollywood blockbuster productions (""Harry Potter"", ""Spiderman"" ETC.) it feels most satisfying to find a small, amiable, entertaining, film comedy like ""Little Miss Sunshine"", that seems to depend on nothing more than a good script and fine acting performances. To watch it win numerous awards and do reasonably well at the box office is even better!In ""Little Miss Sunshine"" we are introduced to the harried, dysfunctional Hoover family, which seems to be just barely getting by. The Father, Richard (Greg Kinear) is a would-be motivational speaker, trying to make a big deal happen, in order get financial investors for his program. The Mom, Sheryl (Toni Colette) is dealing with the family's financial stresses, plus everyone elses problems. This includes her brother, Frank (Steve Carell) an academic, who has come to live with the family after a recent suicide attempt, over a gay love affair with a student. The Hoover's depressed son, Dwayne (Paul Dano) has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Air Force Academy to achieve his dream to fly. The family's drug addicted, Grandpa (an excellent Alan Arkin) is an overly opinionated old man, who lets his expletive filled, tactless comments fly if you want to hear them or not. Finally, in the title role is seven year old, Olive (Abigail Breslin) a sweet little girl with a sunny disposition and an obsession with beauty pageants.The Hoovers recieve a phone call, that Olive has made the finals of the 'Little Miss Sunshine' Beauty Pageant in Rodondo Beach, CA. We watch as this eccentric family climbs into a decrepit, un-airconditioned, yellow, VW Micro-bus and make the 700 mile journey, which is filled with both big laughs, drama and tears. We watch as they try to follow their hopes & dreams and learn, that sometimes it just dosn't matter if you fit-in or not. In other words, sometimes you have to just let your 'Freak Flag Fly'!Co-Directors, Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris' have done a sure and steady job creating a wonderful film. Likewise, Screen Writer, Michael Ardnt's Academy Award winning script (""Best Writing, Original Screenplay"") is filled with rich, well-rounded characters, witty, funny dialogue and a story that makes the viewer care.But the best attribute of the film is the talented ensemble cast of actors, who's peformances really made this movie. Toni Colette is a accomplished actress, who always seems to just disapear into her roles. She is just great as the stressed out mom, who keeps everyone together. Greg Kinear, who I havn't exactly been a big fan of in the past, does a terrific job as the frustrated, desperate Dad, who just won't give up on his goals. Alan Arkan won an Oscar (""Best Performance By an Actor in a Supporting Role"") as the foul-mouthed Grandpa, provided some of the film's biggest laughs, while showing a lot of heart. Like-wise, Steve Carell's (in a pre-""Office"" role) depressed, Proust Scholar is an excellent performance, providing dead panned laughs and loads of outsider wisdom. Finally, Abigail Breslin is a juvenile actress, who is in a star-making role and more than holds her own with her fellow performers. Bravo to the whole brilliant cast!""Little Miss Sunshine"" really is 'the little film that could'. It's funny and moving, providing themes about being yourself and not being afraid to go after your dreams. Great Movie!

1029509,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000JU9OJ4,Kevin Killian,"[0, 4]","There aren't a lot of laughs in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, and most of them involves mishaps to the van.  Like when the door falls off, people in the theater laughed a little bit, perhaps startled by the noise of the door's clang on the parking lot asphalt.  All in all it was a pretty glum affair, but a good one, sort of like the old-time New American Cinema movies of the 1970s like THE LONG GOODBYE or FIVE EASY PIECES.A family group tries to complete a roadtrip of 1000 miles West, mirroring an earlier voyage of discovery and colonial conquest by American empire builders and covered wagon pioneers.  And of ci=urse you can't take a road trip in the movies without learning a lot about yourself.  For an independent film, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE hits practically all the three-act plot points Syd Field and his ilk recommend.  Each of the actors undergoes his or her own trauma, revelation, and recovery.  Most of them were pretty well done, like Greg Kinnear's encounter with Bryan Cranston at the Scottsdale hotel.  It did seem a little coincidental that little Olive would happen to have brought with her a test for color blindness to use as a game.  That was hard to swallow.But what really threw me off was Steve Carell's encounter with the one person in the whole world he didn't want to see, at some kind of roadside 7-11 in the middle of nowhere.  Did the screenwriters ever pause to ask themselves if an audience would believe this?  It is to Carell's credit that he almost makes it work.  And the rival Proust scholar who takes over Frank's title and his boyfriend?  Isn't it the Canadian actor who used to play the gay son on Dynasty--Gordon Thomson?  Maybe I'm getting mixed up and his character wasn't gay, just seemed like it.  If so, it's great that Gordon Thomson has hooked himself onto a hit.

1029511,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B000JU9OJ4,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[4, 7]","Imagine a family having dinner. The husband talks about a ""Nine Steps To Success"" plan he has made into a book, which he plans to sell to the world and make millions. He is obsessed with success because he's had very little success of his own. A little girl watches a beauty pageant with intensity you rarely see in a child, as she dreams of a future that will never come. A teenage boy who appears to hate EVERYONE has taken a vow of silence until he reaches his dream goal of becoming a test pilot! A grandpa eats chicken and snorts cocain, catching up on all the stupid mistakes he wished he had made as a kid. A uncle who attempted suicide failed in his attempt to kill himself, and now must learn to pick up the pieces in his life again. Then we have a mom who loves her family dearly, but finds herself about to explode trying to keep it together.This is the Hoover family, a family that is dysfunctional, all have dreams, and don't quite know what to do with themselves. They are all stuck in their daily routine, letting their problems and worries pile up until there is almost nowhere left to pile them. Then one day the daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin, who fully deserves her Best Supporting Actress nomination), gets a call from the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Due to a previous contender dropping out of the competition due to diet pills (they grow up so fast these days) Olive is now entered into the competition. With no money to get to the pageant by plane though the dad, Richard (Greg Kinnear), packs up the family for a road trip to California in order to get Olive to Little Miss Sunshine. No one in the family (save for Olive) is happy about this trip.Neither Grandpa (Alan Arkin) or son Dwayne (Paul Dano) want to go on the trip, but due to Uncle Frank's (Steve Carell) suicide attempt has to come along (because it would be irresponsible to leave these two alone in the house to watch Uncle Frank). With dear old mom Sheryl (Toni Collette) the only one who could possibly keep this family from killing each other, she too is along for the road trip. Things don't always go as smoothly as they should though. In what becomes one of the best running gags in the movie, the stick shift of their mini-bus breaks, so they have to constantly push the mini-bus until they can get it into the third gear. Grandpa gives Dwayne advice my grandpa would have never given me, as when he justifies his cocain addition by saying ""When you're young you'd be dumb to snort cocain. When you're old you'd be dumb not to.""These people have issues, but it doesn't matter. Really, it doesn't. This is not a movie about dysfunctional people who overcome their quirks to become ""normal."" No, this is a movie about people who are dysfunctional and come to terms with the fact that they, and everyone else around them, are dysfunctional too. The point is that they all love each other. Overcoming personal quirks is a battle you're destined to fail, and anyone who tells you otherwise is a moron. But quirks can be embraced and become redeeming features about you. One of these quirks is the way Frank runs. Truth be told, it's a silly looking run, one that you would easily mock if you saw it on the street. Once you see it a few times though, you realize that the run is a result of his attempts to get his life back on track, one foot after the other. It's just one of many examples of the excellent acting and character development found in the film.Of course, the reason all this works above all else is because the movie is funny. Looking back at what I wrote, I realize I must have made this movie sound like a drama. Well, there are some dramatic moments, but this is a comedy through and through. In lesser movies about road trips (I'm looking at you ""RV"") the characters would get themselves into situations that wanted to be funny but weren't. Most of the time these situations involve main characters getting covered in fecal matter, family deputes over little things like how they look, and the road trip itself would be the cover up for a big meeting dad has to go to.In this movie no one gets covered in unmentionables, the conversations about beauty are talked about frankly instead of stupidly, and the road trip really is about the pageant itself. If there is a flaw to the movie it's the beauty pageant itself. We have so much fun on the road, that when we get to the pageant itself it's kind of weird and creepy. Seeing all these seven year old kids walking around with makeup on and dressing in [...]dresses is certainly accurate, but disturbing none-the-less. When the movie ends there is sense of wanting to continue with the family to see where their life goes, but also a sense that they've come to grips with who they are, and though they will still be dysfunctional when they get home, they will also live better lives as a result of this trip. Once again the old saying that the destination is not as important as the journey itself proves true once again.Rating: **** stars",4,Ladies and Gentlemen: It's Time For Little Miss

1029512,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000JU9OJ4,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","&#34;Little Miss Sunshine&#34; is yet another quirky indie comedy, this time about a dysfunctional family roadtrip. Every character has the requisite wacky personality and/or oddball mannerisms (as is the case in every film of this type). The plot is minimal and contrived, existing for the sole purpose of forcing this unlikely family together. Handled incorrectly, I would usually loathe this type of film. So I'm pleased to report that &#34;Little Miss Sunshine&#34; is far more successful than it has any right to be. While I still feel as if this little picture was slightly overpraised upon its release (as well as being a major Oscar contender), it provides many laughs and works as screwball comedy.One thing that sets &#34;Sunshine&#34; apart from similar indies is a stellar cast. Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette do fine work as the embattled parents. Abigail Breslin brings a refreshing blend of hope and delusion to the title character. Oscar winner Alan Arkin chews the scenery as the foul mouthed addict father.  It's nice to see him again, especially in such a showy in-your-face performance. Steve Carell is surprisingly sympathetic as the depressive homosexual brother. And Paul Dano, in my opinion, delivers the movie's best performance as the disconnected son who has taken a vow of silence. So even though this colorful, supremely eccentric bunch are character &#34;types&#34; as opposed to real people, the actors make it work. The moments of drama that appear succeed only because the actors make you care.But, first and foremost, this is a comedy. And I forgave the calculated eccentricities because the film is simply funny. Outrageous and slapstick, yet smartly observant, this film earns your respect and laughs. It's a fun ride with many identifiable situations.Beloved by audiences and most critics upon its release, I would hesitate to overhype this film for new viewers. Someone who discovers this picture is likely to appreciate its charms more than someone who goes into it having heard that it's the best film ever. &#34;Little Miss Sunshine&#34; is not particularly original (it shares many plot elements from &#34;Vacation,&#34; in fact), but it is extremely well done.

Her father (played by Greg Kinnear) is a failed motivational speaker, her grandfather (Alan Arkin) is a trouble-making curmudgeon, her uncle (Steve Carell) is suicidal, her mother (Toni Collette) is always screaming, and her alienated fifteen-year old brother refuses to speak.

Sometimes I am lucky and have seen one or two already and tend to have my favorite.This year, however, I have yet to catch up fully.The first stop on the list of films is the first one I have noticed is on DVD; Little Miss Sunshine.From the get go, this movie had three things going for it already.  First: Greg Kinnear, whom I have watched since Talk Soup and have seen almost all of his movies.  He is a constant surprise when it comes to acting.Secondly: Steve Carrell.  When one thinks of subtle comedy being hilarious, Steve Carrell is not the first name which comes to mind.  Often he's blaring while seeming innocent.  Witness ""Bruce Almighty"" or ""Anchorman.""Third: Nominated for Best Picture...and other Oscars.  For some odd reason I tend to agree with the nominees on a yearly basis.  Based upon the description of the films, and the titles, there have been times wherein I have shuddered at the thought of watching given films.Little Miss Sunshine is a story about a dysfunctional family.  The patriarch (Greg Kinnear) is spending all of his time and effort, along with the family's money, into a success program he has developed.  There are nine steps in this program claiming to make anyone and everyone successful.  Ironically, he's a complete failure.There's Uncle Frank (the subtle and hilarious Steve Carell) who is a gay, formerly world class Professor respected world wide.  He is staying with his sister's (Toni Collette) family while being watched after a failed suicide attempt.  Again, his character has a mirrored and tragic twist as he has been a complete success his entire life and fails miserably trying to end it.We also meet Dwayne (Paul Dano.) He's the 15 year old son refusing to utter a word until he achieves his goal of becoming an Air Force pilot.  He has learned everything his knows about his philosiphy in life from Nietzsche.  He is using his silence as a way of quietly dealing with his family.Finally, there is Grampa and Little Miss Sunshine herself, Olive (as played by Academy Award nominees Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin respectively.) Grampa has recently been kicked out of a retirement home because of his attitude and vulgar demeanor.  He spends most of his time getting high on heroin and rehearsing a pageant routine with his granddaughter, Olive.  Olive has dreams of becoming a world famous Beauty Pageant Champion while having a small potbelly, larger than normal gapped teeth, and 80's style glasses.The family receives a call stating a contestant from a competition Olive was involved in had to drop out.  Therefore, Olive became the next contestant in line to take the crown of ""Little Miss Sunshine.""  From there, the family sets its track for Rodondo Beach, CA to get her to the pageant.  Needless to say, comedy and mayhem ensue.This movie is quite funny.  It's not the normal slapstick, crude joke, idiotic comedy which is all too popular nowadays. (Jackass, Adam Sandler's resume.) Instead, it's a heartwarming, touching, life lesson learning film of the realistic, dysfunctional family we are all a part of.  In every group of related beings, there is undoubtedly one or two, but usually all the members which have some sort of knack for getting under the skin of everyone else.The journey this family takes while on the road to realize Olive's dream is one filled with lessons not only from the obvious (don't kill yourself),  but to the small, albeit grand rules in life we must learn the hard way (not everything will go you way...and there's more to life than meets the eye.)The oddest thing about the film is how bright it is, while having some of the darkest themes I have witnessed in a 'family film.'  Although this is an ""R"" rated family film, it's one I think is important for families to watch, once the children are older.Without giving too much away, I suggest everyone watches this film simply because it's heartwrenching, funny, touching, and scary all wrapped into one sunny, 103 minute package.Watch, and enjoy!",4,Sunny Days,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,4087,"['make', 'habit', 'year', 'watch', 'least', 'five', 'best', 'picture', 'nominess', 'Oscars', 'Sometimes', 'am', 'lucky', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'two', 'already', 'tend', 'have', 'favorite.This', 'year', 'however', 'have', 'yet', 'catch', 'up', 'fully.The', 'first', 'stop', 'list', 'films', 'first', 'one', 'have', 'noticed', 'DVD', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine.From', 'get', 'go', 'movie', 'had', 'three', 'things', 'going', 'already', 'First', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'whom', 'have', 'watched', 'Talk', 'Soup', 'have', 'seen', 'almost', 'movies', 'constant', 'surprise', 'when', 'acting.Secondly', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'When', 'one', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'being', 'hilarious', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'not', 'first', 'name', 'mind', 'blaring', 'seeming', 'innocent', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'Anchorman', 'Third', 'Nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'other', 'Oscars', 'odd', 'reason', 'tend', 'agree', 'nominees', 'yearly', 'basis', 'Based', 'description', 'films', 'titles', 'have', 'been', 'times', 'wherein', 'have', 'shuddered', 'thought', 'watching', 'given', 'films.Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'story', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'patriarch', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'spending', 'time', 'effort', 'family', 'money', 'success', 'program', 'developed', 'are', 'nine', 'steps', 'program', 'claiming', 'make', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'successful', 'Ironically', 'complete', 'failure.There', 'Uncle', 'Frank', 'subtle', 'hilarious', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'who', 'gay', 'formerly', 'world', 'class', 'Professor', 'respected', 'world', 'wide', 'staying', 'sister', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'family', 'being', 'watched', 'failed', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Again', 'character', 'mirrored', 'tragic', 'twist', 'been', 'complete', 'success', 'entire', 'life', 'miserably', 'trying', 'end', 'it.We', 'also', 'Dwayne', 'Paul', 'Dano', '15', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'refusing', 'utter', 'word', 'goal', 'becoming', 'Air', 'Force', 'pilot', 'learned', 'everything', 'knows', 'philosiphy', 'life', 'Nietzsche', 'using', 'silence', 'way', 'quietly', 'dealing', 'family.Finally', 'Grampa', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Olive', 'played', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'respectively', 'Grampa', 'recently', 'been', 'kicked', 'retirement', 'home', 'attitude', 'vulgar', 'demeanor', 'most', 'time', 'getting', 'high', 'heroin', 'rehearsing', 'pageant', 'routine', 'granddaughter', 'Olive', 'Olive', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'world', 'famous', 'Beauty', 'Pageant', 'Champion', 'having', 'small', 'potbelly', 'larger', 'normal', 'gapped', 'teeth', '80', 'style', 'glasses.The', 'family', 'call', 'stating', 'contestant', 'competition', 'Olive', 'was', 'involved', 'had', 'drop', 'out', 'Therefore', 'Olive', 'became', 'next', 'contestant', 'line', 'take', 'crown', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'there', 'family', 'track', 'Rodondo', 'Beach', 'CA', 'get', 'pageant', 'Needless', 'say', 'comedy', 'mayhem', 'ensue.This', 'movie', 'quite', 'funny', 'not', 'normal', 'slapstick', 'crude', 'joke', 'idiotic', 'comedy', 'too', 'popular', 'nowadays', 'Jackass', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'resume', 'Instead', 'heartwarming', 'touching', 'life', 'lesson', 'learning', 'film', 'realistic', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'are', 'part', 'group', 'related', 'beings', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'two', 'usually', 'members', 'have', 'sort', 'knack', 'getting', 'skin', 'everyone', 'else.The', 'journey', 'family', 'road', 'realize', 'Olive', 'dream', 'one', 'filled', 'lessons', 'not', 'only', 'obvious', 'do', ""n't"", 'kill', 'small', 'albeit', 'grand', 'rules', 'life', 'must', 'learn', 'hard', 'way', 'not', 'everything', 'will', 'go', 'way', 'more', 'life', 'eye', 'oddest', 'thing', 'film', 'how', 'bright', 'having', 'darkest', 'themes', 'have', 'witnessed', ""'family"", 'film', 'R', 'rated', 'family', 'film', 'one', 'think', 'important', 'families', 'watch', 'once', 'children', 'are', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'suggest', 'everyone', 'watches', 'film', 'simply', 'heartwrenching', 'funny', 'touching', 'scary', 'wrapped', 'one', 'sunny', '103', 'minute', 'package.Watch', 'enjoy']",N/A

There's something special about that bond because he comes back.The pageant is a little freaky especially if you have never seen the kind that Jon Benet competed in.

1029519,A2T049UQONS0OY,B000JU9OJ4,Larry VanDeSande,"[2, 4]","Here's the movie the Motion Picture Academy overrated and nominated for best picture for 2006, much as it did with ""Sideways"" a 2004 flick about a pair of middle aged guys travleing through California's wine country a few years earlier. This one is about a dysfunctional family traveling in California too. Think there's a coincidental relationship between the academy nominating each for best picture? Maybe it has something to do with all the electors and voters living in California?As you probably know, this involves a typically dysfunctional family (highly Hollywoodized) that consists of an out of work dad (Greg Kinnear), standup mom that holds it all together (Toni Collette), pervert father that lives with them (Alan Arkin), loser brother that lost his boyfriend and job, tried to commit suicide, and now lives with them (Steve Carell, better known as the ""40 Year Old Virgin""), bitter and alienated teenage son (Paul Dano) and the star, Little Miss Sunshine herself, 12-year-old Olive (Abagail Breslin) who wins a local contest and competes for the national title of the named character.The action revolves around the family taking its trip from New Mexico to the pagaent near Los Angeles and the various underlying stories that go on while that's in progress. Every character is a cliche, of course, with the mother being the typical savior that holds it all together. The film is variably hilarious, stupid, insightful, energetic, arousing, perverted and sentimental. You will laugh a lot at and with these characters during their trip to, and arrival at, the Little Miss Sunshine pagaent, where a lot of nonsense breaks out that would only occur in a movie or a Three Stooges routine.If you're like me, you'll wonder why the Motion Picture Academy thought this was one of the five best movies of 2006. Its temperament reminds me a bit of ""In America"", a movie from 2002 starring a pair of real life sisters that lit up the screen with transcendent performances that bordered on magic. That film didn't have the outright humor of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" but it was, from my perspective, a far better production and a much better story.This one will leave you feeling good, if that's your goal, and it will entertain you throughout, but it definitely should not have been considered an Oscar contender.",4,Not quite 4 stars but close -- a winning comedy,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,2314,"['Here', 'movie', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'overrated', 'nominated', 'best', 'picture', '2006', 'much', 'did', 'Sideways', '2004', 'flick', 'pair', 'middle', 'aged', 'guys', 'travleing', 'California', 'wine', 'country', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'one', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'traveling', 'California', 'too', 'Think', 'coincidental', 'relationship', 'academy', 'nominating', 'best', 'picture', 'Maybe', 'something', 'do', 'electors', 'voters', 'living', 'California', 'probably', 'know', 'typically', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'highly', 'Hollywoodized', 'out', 'work', 'dad', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'standup', 'mom', 'together', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'pervert', 'father', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'loser', 'brother', 'lost', 'boyfriend', 'job', 'tried', 'commit', 'suicide', 'now', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'better', 'known', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'bitter', 'alienated', 'teenage', 'son', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'star', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', '12-year-old', 'Olive', 'Abagail', 'Breslin', 'who', 'local', 'contest', 'competes', 'national', 'title', 'named', 'character.The', 'action', 'family', 'taking', 'trip', 'New', 'Mexico', 'pagaent', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'various', 'underlying', 'stories', 'go', 'progress', 'character', 'cliche', 'course', 'mother', 'being', 'typical', 'savior', 'together', 'film', 'variably', 'hilarious', 'stupid', 'insightful', 'energetic', 'arousing', 'perverted', 'sentimental', 'will', 'laugh', 'lot', 'characters', 'trip', 'arrival', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'pagaent', 'where', 'lot', 'nonsense', 'breaks', 'out', 'would', 'only', 'occur', 'movie', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'routine.If', ""'re"", ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'why', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'five', 'best', 'movies', '2006', 'temperament', 'bit', 'America', 'movie', '2002', 'starring', 'pair', 'real', 'life', 'sisters', 'lit', 'up', 'screen', 'transcendent', 'performances', 'bordered', 'magic', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'outright', 'humor', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'was', 'perspective', 'far', 'better', 'production', 'much', 'better', 'story.This', 'one', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', 'good', 'goal', 'will', 'entertain', 'definitely', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'Oscar', 'contender']",N/A

(I'm thinking it gave them validation our family wasn't THE most bizarre .. back then, we didn't know the word dysfunctional existed or that it applied to nearly every family).I kept waiting and waiting for it to become hilarious while beginning to feel nearly as depressed as some of the (somewhat stereotypical) characters in the movie.  If you're looking for a comedy, be forewarned the humor in this movie tends toward the dark and is probably not age appropriate for younger children.Yes, there were scenes and moments that were amusing - sometimes for the shock value and sometimes because it was reminiscent of the angst and quirkiness that exists within our own families - or for the simple absurdity.  The scenes with the van were like a flashback to my youth, although our own experiences weren't quite so dramatic or funny.I considered not finishing the movie, but realized it had drawn me in enough that I had to see it through to the conclusion.  I won't reveal the ending, but it did live up to hilarious and unexpected.  If I had to do it all over again, I have to admit I'd have passed on this one.  It's rather like an endless joke that is painful to see through to the conclusion but you're rewarded for your tenacity with a good laugh. I don't remember the screen time, but it was too long to be worth it for me.

Quido ""quidrock""","[5, 7]","If you've ever been on one of those family vacations where everything that can go wrong, goes wrong, then moments of Little Miss Sunshine will resonate with you. The finest part of the film was the casting, and the ability of the director to draw out an excellent ensemble synergy. No one person in the cast stands out, and all slip right into the skin of their personal dysfunctional character like hand in glove.The nuclear family in the story, of Albuquerque, is headed by Kinnear as Richard, the developer of a ""self-help"" routine that he's trying to sell, wife Sheryl (Collette), stepson Dwayne (Paul Dano, brilliantly cast as a misfit teen, a devotee of the combination of Nietzche and the Air Force) and young 7 year old Olive (Abigail Breslin), who has not yet been touched by the pessimistic air of the family, and who is the vital force that keeps them all moving forward. Breslin is perhaps the finest part of the film (she has appeared before, in ""Signs"").For the ""road trip"" on which the film centers, the family is trying to get Olive to Redondo Beach, CA for a young girl's pageant know as Little Miss Sunshine. It's not clear why Olive is fixated on the pageant, but the family pulls out all the stops to go. In doing so, they can't leave behind their houseguests, Richard's father (Alan Arkin as Grandpa) who was thrown out of assisted living for shooting heroin, and Sheryl's brother Frank (Carrell), who has recently lost his tenured position, his lover and has tried to commit suicide. This is not a laugh out loud role for Carrell, and it's excellent to see the bittersweet side of him.Along the trip, there are many challenges that would have sent a family less devoted to their daughter back home again...there's a great scene with ice cream in a diner...but nothing tops the family's reaction when they get to the pageant. Given the recent developments in the JonBenet case, and the endless fascination the public has with those shots of JonBenet in her ""glam"" pageants, the bizarre competition that Olive faces in the person of many little girls aged well beyond their youth is startling.Olive's been working on the talent portion of the competition with her grandfather, and her talent is completely inappropriate and hilarious. The support she receives from her family, however, shows that even the most dysfunctional families can pull together in a crisis, and grow from it.Without giving away any more of the film, I'll tell you that you will find ""Little Miss Sunshine"" metaphorical and sweet at some turns, laugh out loud at others.

After watching both of those, this seems like a poor second cousin, with very little going on that would qualify for so much praise.Don't get me wrong - I loved this movie - in parts. To me, the strongest actors were Paul Dano and Abigail Breslin (who I think, is a good actress beyond her years, and a REAL actress unlike the young Dakota Fanning). Paul Dano plays the young Dwayne, and his is the most unnerving and realistic depiction of a troubled teen I have seen in some time. The other characters were good, but the actors weren't really breaking new ground with their performances. Toni Colette especially was disappointing. At one point, I used to watch every movie she was in, she was just THAT good, but of late she seems to be signing every weak film in existence. Weird.Alan Arkin did NOT deserve the Oscar for this performance. First of all, he dies half way through, and secondly, he had the most boring lines and the worst screen presence. That Oscar belonged to Hounsou for ""Blood Diamond"" - Arkin had no business getting it, as much as I love his body of work.What did not work for me was the climax - granted it is ""Sweet"", but what about reality? If the intention was to make a comedy, they should not have thrown in the element of realism that they tried so hard to create through the film - it was more of an anticlimax and a very disappointing one at that. I can see people smiling and clapping through the end of the movie, but I was just sitting there wondering ""Is This It?"".But if you must watch this movie, watch it for Paul Dano, the young star who plays the recluse Dwayne. That was the only good thing about this movie other than Abigail, and to me signalled the arrival of a huge new star.There are other better movies on the same lines out there - please check out the wonderful ""The Daytrippers"" starring Hope Davis and Parker Posey, as well as the Beauty Contest satire ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"". After those, you'll be left wondering why on earth ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is garnering so much praise.An average film. Don't buy it, just rent it.

1029538,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000JU9OJ4,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[10, 14]","Little Miss Sunshine is a dysfunctional family drama that follows the trials and tribulations of six family members as they trek cross-country in their crumbling VW bus in an attempt to get the youngest, Olive, to a Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California.Perhaps the most endearing thing about Little Miss Sunshine isn't it's intimate look inside the slightly twisted hearts of its six main characters.  It isn't the off-kilter comedy of its road-trip plot.  It isn't even the almost flawless acting of young Abigail Breslin as Olive, the precocious young girl with dreams of being a beauty pageant winner.No, what makes this movie truly unique is how it takes what could be a rote plot contrivance (Will she win the pageant?) and turns it on its head (SHOULD she win the pageant?).  By the time the family reaches the end of their difficult journey (having endured mechanical failures, an uncomfortably close experience with death, and even the saving grace of pornographic magazines) they are moving on auto-pilot, doggedly moving ahead simply because that has been their purpose.  When they reach the pageant, though, instead of a moving moment of self-redemption, it serves as a grotesque reminder that sometimes dreams are less important than the reasons those dreams exist in the first place.This movie is, after all, about people who have failed.  Greg Kinnear plays with exquisite desperation the patriarch, Richard, a failed motivational speaker (and, no, the irony isn't lost on him).  Dwayne is a typically-rebellious young teen who follows the teachings of Nietzsche and has sworn to a vow of silence until he achieves his goal of becoming an Air Force fighter pilot.  Alan Arkin is the foul-mouthed, drug-addicted grandfather, searching for his own version of contentment in his life's twilight years.  Toni Collette is absolutely perfect as the mother, Sheryl, who has made this frazzled family the locus of her own frazzled life.  And Steve Carell shines, cast against type as the once-eminent Proust scholar, Frank, who is attempting to recover after losing his lover, his job, and his will to keep on living.Given such a cast of characters, it would be easy to see it devolving (even with the talent at hand) into something melodramatic and cheesy, but this movie operates with a light touch.  Never does the film indulge in the kind of shameless self-congratulatory lesson-learning that dysfunctional family comedies are so rife with these days.  We are treated, instead, to a tender and yet unflinching look at these people and how they struggle.  This is, quite obviously, a family of losers (in whatever way you want to define that word), but -- as we are shown in the final scenes -- in a world that is sickeningly obsessed with winning, being a loser is nothing to be ashamed of.",5,The Warm World of Loveable Losers,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,2806,"['Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'drama', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'six', 'family', 'members', 'trek', 'cross-country', 'crumbling', 'VW', 'bus', 'attempt', 'get', 'youngest', 'Olive', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'pageant', 'California.Perhaps', 'most', 'endearing', 'thing', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', ""n't"", 'intimate', 'look', 'slightly', 'twisted', 'hearts', 'six', 'main', 'characters', ""n't"", 'off-kilter', 'comedy', 'road-trip', 'plot', ""n't"", 'even', 'almost', 'flawless', 'acting', 'young', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Olive', 'precocious', 'young', 'girl', 'dreams', 'being', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'winner.No', 'what', 'movie', 'truly', 'unique', 'how', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'rote', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'Will', 'win', 'pageant', 'head', 'SHOULD', 'win', 'pageant', 'time', 'family', 'end', 'difficult', 'journey', 'having', 'endured', 'mechanical', 'failures', 'uncomfortably', 'close', 'experience', 'death', 'even', 'saving', 'grace', 'pornographic', 'magazines', 'are', 'moving', 'auto-pilot', 'doggedly', 'moving', 'ahead', 'simply', 'been', 'purpose', 'When', 'reach', 'pageant', 'though', 'instead', 'moving', 'moment', 'self-redemption', 'grotesque', 'reminder', 'sometimes', 'dreams', 'are', 'less', 'important', 'reasons', 'dreams', 'exist', 'first', 'place.This', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'failed', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'exquisite', 'desperation', 'patriarch', 'Richard', 'failed', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'irony', ""n't"", 'lost', 'Dwayne', 'typically-rebellious', 'young', 'teen', 'who', 'teachings', 'Nietzsche', 'sworn', 'vow', 'silence', 'goal', 'becoming', 'Air', 'Force', 'fighter', 'pilot', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'foul-mouthed', 'drug-addicted', 'grandfather', 'searching', 'own', 'version', 'contentment', 'life', 'twilight', 'years', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'mother', 'Sheryl', 'who', 'made', 'frazzled', 'family', 'locus', 'own', 'frazzled', 'life', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'shines', 'cast', 'type', 'once-eminent', 'Proust', 'scholar', 'Frank', 'who', 'attempting', 'recover', 'losing', 'lover', 'job', 'will', 'keep', 'living.Given', 'such', 'cast', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'see', 'devolving', 'even', 'talent', 'hand', 'something', 'melodramatic', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'light', 'touch', 'Never', 'film', 'indulge', 'kind', 'shameless', 'self-congratulatory', 'lesson-learning', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'comedies', 'are', 'so', 'rife', 'days', 'are', 'treated', 'instead', 'tender', 'yet', 'unflinching', 'look', 'people', 'how', 'struggle', 'quite', 'obviously', 'family', 'losers', 'way', 'want', 'define', 'word', 'are', 'shown', 'final', 'scenes', 'world', 'sickeningly', 'obsessed', 'winning', 'being', 'loser', 'nothing', 'be', 'ashamed']",N/A

The acting is very convincing and the plot moves along at a good pace.The movie tells the story of a particularly dysfunctional family on a mission: Their little girl, Olive (Abigail Breslin) has been chosen to be a finalist in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty/talent contest. Her parents, Richard and Sheryl Hoover (Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette) decide to indulge their daughter and take her to the show. Along for the ride, both literally and figuratively, are Sheryl's suicidal brother Frank (Steve Carell) and Richard's father Edwin (Alan Arkin). Look also for Olive's older brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), who refuses to talk because he loves Nietzsche.Things aren't easy for the Hoover family. Richard's motivational ""nine step"" program won't sell and the family is losing practically all their money in the process; and Richard's father does heroin when nobody's looking just to get through the day. Dwayne wants to fly jets even after he discovers that he's colorblind; and Frank wallows in a type of self-pity depression because his male lover left him and he wasn't awarded the number one Proust scholar in the nation.Of all the characters, however, little Olive holds out the most hope. She's nervous but she really thinks she just might win the talent contest and be crowned Little Miss Sunshine.Will Olive be crowned Little Miss Sunshine? What happens after their ancient, rapidly decaying VW bus gets a broken clutch and a broken horn? Will they get to the contest in time? Will they all get there in the first place? Watch the movie and find out!The cinematography is rather fine; I liked the scenes of the countryside as they traveled in their VW bus; and the scenes of the talent/beauty contest reflect good judgment. The choreography shines through in scenes where the little girls all compete for the title of Little Miss Sunshine.The DVD comes with a commentary by the directors and there is another commentary with both the screenwriter and the directors. There are four deleted ending scenes that also have optional commentary. In addition, one side of the DVD presents the movie in widescreen while the other side of the DVD presents the movie in full screen format. Impressive for a single DVD release!Overall, Little Miss Sunshine is fantastic entertainment. Funny at times, sad at times, the film never loses its focus. Some people may say that it tries too hard to please but I didn't pick up on that; I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The movie is rated R so I would caution parents not to let young children watch this movie.Great job, everyone!",5,dropped from celluloid heaven indeed !!!,1195689600,"11 22, 2007",2007,2703,"['Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'one', 'bittersweet', 'comedies', 'catches', 'attention', 'right', 'away', 'attention', 'quite', 'well', 'acting', 'very', 'convincing', 'plot', 'along', 'good', 'pace.The', 'movie', 'story', 'particularly', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'mission', 'little', 'girl', 'Olive', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'been', 'chosen', 'be', 'finalist', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'beauty/talent', 'contest', 'parents', 'Richard', 'Sheryl', 'Hoover', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'decide', 'indulge', 'daughter', 'take', 'show', 'ride', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'are', 'Sheryl', 'suicidal', 'brother', 'Frank', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Richard', 'father', 'Edwin', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Look', 'also', 'Olive', 'older', 'brother', 'Dwayne', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'who', 'talk', 'Nietzsche.Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'easy', 'Hoover', 'family', 'Richard', 'motivational', 'nine', 'step', 'program', 'wo', ""n't"", 'sell', 'family', 'losing', 'practically', 'money', 'process', 'Richard', 'father', 'heroin', 'when', 'nobody', 'looking', 'just', 'get', 'day', 'Dwayne', 'fly', 'jets', 'even', 'colorblind', 'Frank', 'type', 'self-pity', 'depression', 'male', 'lover', 'left', 'was', ""n't"", 'awarded', 'number', 'one', 'Proust', 'scholar', 'nation.Of', 'characters', 'however', 'little', 'Olive', 'out', 'most', 'hope', 'nervous', 'really', 'just', 'might', 'win', 'talent', 'contest', 'be', 'crowned', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine.Will', 'Olive', 'be', 'crowned', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'What', 'ancient', 'rapidly', 'decaying', 'VW', 'bus', 'broken', 'clutch', 'broken', 'horn', 'Will', 'get', 'contest', 'time', 'get', 'there', 'first', 'place', 'Watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'cinematography', 'rather', 'fine', 'liked', 'scenes', 'countryside', 'traveled', 'VW', 'bus', 'scenes', 'talent/beauty', 'contest', 'reflect', 'good', 'judgment', 'choreography', 'shines', 'scenes', 'where', 'little', 'girls', 'compete', 'title', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine.The', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'directors', 'commentary', 'screenwriter', 'directors', 'are', 'four', 'deleted', 'ending', 'scenes', 'also', 'have', 'optional', 'commentary', 'addition', 'one', 'side', 'DVD', 'movie', 'widescreen', 'other', 'side', 'DVD', 'movie', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'Impressive', 'single', 'DVD', 'release', 'Overall', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'fantastic', 'entertainment', 'Funny', 'times', 'sad', 'times', 'film', 'never', 'focus', 'people', 'may', 'say', 'too', 'hard', 'please', 'did', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'movie', 'rated', 'R', 'would', 'caution', 'parents', 'not', 'let', 'young', 'children', 'watch', 'movie.Great', 'job', 'everyone']",N/A

While this movie is about a totally dysfunctional family driving about a thousand miles to enter a child in a beauty pageant, the contest serves just as a focus point for the story.  The real entertainment lies within the family itself.  And what a family it is.Headed by a man who lectures people to find the winner inside of them, we have a father trying to sell a nine-step theory to success.  Unfortunately, he practices what he preaches, much to the dismay of his household, consisting of his foul-mouthed, coke-snorting father; his nervous, chain-smoking wife; his gay, out of work, suicidal brother-in-law; his non-talking, self-disciplined son who claims to hate everyone; and his sweet, loving, seven year old daughter, whose only fault is her addiction to beauty pageants.Being the most rational of them all, it's of course, the little girl who is responsible for bringing this clan together.  She doesn't have that much difficulty achieving this because in spite of their exterior, there is hope for her retched relatives.Grandpa really loves his family and isn't afraid to tell them at various times in his own way.  Mom is a little passive, yet she says the right things at the right time.  The uncle is quick to bond with the kids in spite of his own troubles.  The big brother is very intelligent and eventually comes around, and Dad somehow manages to get his daughter to the contest on time.While parts of it reminded me of vacation, the plot was surprisingly unpredictable, and the brilliant cast made these eccentric characters real enough to sustain the most far-fetched situations.  It had the right combination of elements: enough drama for conflict, enough sentiment to bond the characters, and lots of humor to carry it through.",4,Little Miss Sunshine,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,1884,"['are', 'avoiding', 'film', 'think', 'will', 'see', 'lame', 'beauty', 'contest', 'little', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'title', 'movie', 'totally', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'driving', 'thousand', 'miles', 'enter', 'child', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'contest', 'just', 'focus', 'point', 'story', 'real', 'entertainment', 'family', 'what', 'family', 'is.Headed', 'man', 'who', 'people', 'find', 'winner', 'have', 'father', 'trying', 'sell', 'nine-step', 'theory', 'success', 'Unfortunately', 'practices', 'what', 'much', 'dismay', 'household', 'consisting', 'foul-mouthed', 'coke-snorting', 'father', 'nervous', 'chain-smoking', 'wife', 'gay', 'work', 'suicidal', 'brother-in-law', 'non-talking', 'self-disciplined', 'son', 'who', 'hate', 'everyone', 'sweet', 'loving', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'only', 'fault', 'addiction', 'beauty', 'pageants.Being', 'most', 'rational', 'course', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'responsible', 'bringing', 'clan', 'together', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'difficulty', 'achieving', 'spite', 'exterior', 'hope', 'retched', 'relatives.Grandpa', 'really', 'family', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'tell', 'various', 'times', 'own', 'way', 'Mom', 'little', 'passive', 'yet', 'right', 'things', 'right', 'time', 'uncle', 'quick', 'bond', 'kids', 'spite', 'own', 'troubles', 'big', 'brother', 'very', 'intelligent', 'eventually', 'around', 'Dad', 'somehow', 'get', 'daughter', 'contest', 'time.While', 'parts', 'reminded', 'vacation', 'plot', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'unpredictable', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'made', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'real', 'enough', 'sustain', 'most', 'far-fetched', 'situations', 'had', 'right', 'combination', 'elements', 'enough', 'drama', 'conflict', 'enough', 'sentiment', 'bond', 'characters', 'lots', 'humor', 'carry']",N/A

The day that I, and one of my best friends, saw this film started like most of the other days of my visit to the Bay Area - foggy, hazy and a bit of a chill in the air.  Further clouding the day's potential was a long and emotionally draining conversation with my friend about the breakup of an unrequited love affair and the suicide of her favorite uncle due to heartbreak from a lost romance.  Needless to say, as we watched the first fifteen minutes of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" I felt our ability to sit through the entire film getting more tenuous by the second.  Neither of us ""read up"" on the film but selected it based on the suggestion of friends to ""go see it; it's really good and funny"".  I felt for sure that my friend would bolt from the theatre in tears given the uncanny clash of life and art that befell her as ""Little Miss Sunshine"" played out on the giant screen before us.  But then we meet Olive, exceptionally portrayed by Abigail Breslin, and get a peep at the sunshine and joy that the character embodies.The center of this fully dysfunctional family of parents, older brother, uncle and grandpa, Olive  wins entry (by default) into a regional kiddy beauty pageant which sets the stage for a family road trip that shows just what this family is made of and how much of it is needed to keep them together.  This film is as emotionally accessible as it is humorous and edifying.  By the end of the film we'd both cried when a particularly relevant scene elicited tears of recognition and we'd laughed riotously when a scene helped us remember that even in the midst of life's chaos, there are always rays of pure joy and outright fun.

The parents, Richard and Sheryl (Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette), constantly bicker about Richard's futile efforts to become a self-help guru. Sheryl's teenage son Dwayne (Paul Dano) refuses to speak to anyone due to the teachings of Friedrich Nietzsche. Frank (Steve Carell) is Sheryl's brother who recently attempted suicide, and Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is basically a dirty old man. The whole crazy family comes together when it's time for seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, and everyone piles into a clunky old VW van for the long weekend trip. Despite several bumps in the road, including the untimely death of one of their own, the Hoopers remain focused on their goal of getting Olive to the pageant on time. Unfortunately for Olive, she really isn't pageant material...in other words, she's normal. Things at the pageant don't exactly go as planned, but all of the Hoopers come out as ""winners"" in the end (except for poor Grandpa).I really enjoyed this fun, quirky little movie. The cast is excellent, but I was especially impressed with Arkin, whose foul-mouthed comments steal the show; Carell, who proves that he can handle a serious role; and the adorable Breslin, who is a delight to watch.

I laughed really hard and cried numerous times. I'm not a big fan of Steve Carell (40 year old virgin, The Office) but I loved him in this film. Olive first won my heart in M. Night Shyamalan's Signs and again in Raising Helen. All the actors young and old were superb and harmonized one another.Some may not think the story line is original--family forced to travel together-- but this really is a dynamic group of actors providing quality entertainment from beginning to end. It has some dark subject matter at times; dealing with issues of depression, suicide, drug abuse, unemployment, and death but most are handled with the utmost respect. I said most.Little Miss Sunshine is a sweet, hysterical and sad film.

Is this movie Oscar worthy?  That's hard to say..it certainly is entertaining and original, with a screenplay that examines a dysfunctional family in a kindly light.The story focuses around little Olive, a ten year old who wants to enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California.  Coached by her wily grandfather, Olive wants to win so badly.  Her father is a motivational speaker whose 9 step program to winning is his ticket for the future, even though no one is really interested in buying it.  Mama is a typical supportive mother whose family means everything to her.  Her brother has recently attempted suicide due to the loss of his male lover and his job.  She feels responsible for getting him back into life.  Her son is a strange one indeed.  He has been in self-imposed silence for nine months to prepare him for a career as an airplane pilot.  Hubby's dad is a grizzly, foul mouthed, heroin addicted octogenarian whose abrasive exterior shadows his true sensitivity.The movie follows their journey to the pageant with some unexpected obstacles.  The cast is uniformly excellent:  Greg Kinnear is superb as the driven dad; Toni Collette is fine as the mom; Alan Arkin in his nominated supporting role provides a nice foundation; Paul Dano is good as the strange son whose future is dashed when a small technicality arises; Steve Carell is wonderful as the suicidal brother; and cute little Abigail Breslin is charming in her supporting actress-nominated role.

If you need a good film to watch and do not want to take the chance on a dud, you can pick this one BUT- this is  a painfully slow at times-with a "" wait, wait, it gets better"" kind of flick.  The ending is key because it leaves you with the spirit that ALL of our families are crazy and that we all still have to get along in life and find our own way.  Its characters are a quirky mob of oddities entangled into one car trip to see the youngest family member attend a beauty pageant. It is painfully obvious to only the audience that she is not a beauty pageant kind of girl. The only really SANE people in this cast of antics are the little girl Olive who the movie is titled after and her Mother who holds everyone's straight jackets at bay. You will see a lot of stereotypes of some of the people you have loved and hated in your life: the nutcase adult brother who tried to commit suicide and is moving in, that dope smoking grandfather who is getting laid everyday at the nursing home, the father who wants to be a motivational speaker, the teenager who is living in persecution, AND you will see the story of how hard it is to feel beautiful as a young girl growing up in a madhouse of American-ideal expectations of what is pretty little girl.

The mother Sheryl (Toni Collette) is in her second marriage and is becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of solid financial support coming into the family.  Her husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) is an aspiring motivational speaker who only sees things as a win or a loss, with no middle ground in between (and this puts a serious strain on his relationships, personal and professional.)  Her son Dwayne (Paul Dano), who was from the previous marriage, is a angst-ridden teenager who has taken a vow of silence under the guise of wanting to become a test pilot, but most signs indicate he just hates his family.  Her seven-year-old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is a chubby little girl who aspires to be a beauty queen after being a runner-up in a local pageant.  They live with  Richard's foulmouthed father Edwin (Alan Arkin), who was evicted from a retirement home for snorting heroin, while the family gave temporary residence to her brother Frank (Steve Carell), who is a homosexual Proust scholar (the best in the country according to him) after he attempted suicide when a rival took both his spotlight and love interest. Well, the winner of the pageant that Olive came second in was unable to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, so as the runner-up Olive, by default, must now go and compete.  Wishing to realize Olive's dream, but not having a lot of money themselves, the family decides to drive to California in an old VW Bus so that Olive can compete in the pageant.  While Richard tries to make himself believe otherwise, everything starts to fall apart while they're on the road, forcing him to realize that maybe he's not quite the winner he makes it out to be.  Will Richard finally see the value in trying as opposed to ""just winning?""  Will Dwayne wish to stop hating his family and reintegrate into the group?  Will Olive win the pageant?  Can Frank overcome his attempt and see the value in life?  What will happen to Edwin and his heroin habit?  And for the love of mercy, will poor Sheryl manage to keep it together?!You know, I really felt bad for Sheryl in this film.  She put up with so much nonsense and tried to fight through all of it with a smile, no matter how hard or taxing it was on her.  But really, this whole thing was about making lemonade out of lemons, and the big yellow bus that's old and falling apart is just a perfect analogy to all of that.  The film was unfortunate and sad at times, but you walked away with the lesson that sometimes, it's not about winning or losing but whether or not you even went up to bat to begin with.  Mix in solid acting, great direction, and a wonderful soundtrack by DeVotchKa and you've got a movie that's worth the acclaims it's received.I recommend this movie to all movie fans.

Moore,"[2, 3]","Friends of mine are already telling me they were disappointed in ""Little Miss Sunshine;"" the reviews have been so unanimously glowing, they complained, that it set their expectations unreasonably high. This really is a shame, because Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' debut feature is second only to Rian Johnson's ""Brick"" as the best American film so far this year, and a more surefire crowd-pleaser than Johnson's more stylized film. But ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is not a movie that wows you; it sidles up to you, tickling your ribs gently at first, then gradually turning up the laugh meter as it progresses until, before you realize it, you're covered in popcorn and spilled Coke from rolling in the aisles. Like other recent quirky comedies--""Sideways,"" ""Garden State,"" and ""The Squid and the Whale""--""Little Miss Sunshine"" mines unforgettable humor from the lives of desperate characters who are lovable despite their glaring character flaws. The plot is simple: The six members of the Hoover family pile into a decrepit VW bus for an 800-mile trek to California so that daughter Olive can compete in the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" beauty pageant finals. All of them are smarting from separate, painful insults to their egos and their hopes, and along the way each one suffers a final, crushing blow--in one case, with extreme prejudice. The beauty of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is that it overcomes all this sorrow to become a joyous experience. No other recent film has demonstrated how thin a line there is between tragedy and comedy, or the crucial difference between embracing life and despairing of it. The buoyancy of the screenplay is matched by the absolute perfection of the ensemble cast. It's virtually impossible to single any of them out, they are all so good. I have to admit a predilection for Alan Arkin and Steve Carell, but I don't want to shortchange the shining, sparkling contributions of Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano and little Abigail Breslin, an almost frighteningly gifted child actress. All I can say is, at the next Screen Actors Guild award show, when the ""Best Comedy Ensemble"" award is announced, they had better read these names, in alphabetical order: Alan Arkin, Abigail Breslin, Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano, and Greg Kinnear.

I've seen too many that are nothing more than chains of tired cliches strung end to end. But ""Little Miss Sunshine""'s vibrant, genuine characters stand out among quirky indie relationship films. Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) is a frustrated motivational speaker with high hopes for a book deal. When his 7-year old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is accepted in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant, the family wants to make sure she has the opportunity to pursue her beauty pageant dreams. But wife Sheryl (Toni Colette) can't drive a stick shift. Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell) can't be left alone. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is Olive's talent coach. And silent teenaged brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is just put upon. So they all pile into the family's yellow VW minibus to drive Olive 700 miles to California.Owing to Michael Arndt's heartfelt script and its wonderful ensemble cast, ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is both hilarious and credible on an emotional level. The characters are active and deliberate, never reactive, and never played for laughs. The interplay of several generations of characters without demeaning or marginalizing any of them always does wonders for relationship dramas. The middle-aged parents, delinquent grandpa, optimistic child, and morose teen are all fully-realized, equally interesting people. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" never feels contrived even though it could hardly be moreso. The characters don't feel like cliches, even though I've seen them before. The family actually functions very well. In the end, I couldn't help liking all of these people and laughing with them all the way to California.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): This is a 2-sided disc with a full screen version on Side A and widescreen on Side B. There are 2 audio commentaries, both of which can be found on either side of the disc. The first audio commentary is by husband and wife directing team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. They discuss the film's tone, casting, filming in the van, the actors, the sets, and  more. The second commentary is by screenwriter Michael Arndt and directors Dayton and Faris. There is more about characters and dialogue in this commentary. But there is a lot of repetition between the commentaries, so if you want to listen to one, I recommend the writer/directors commentary. Also on Side A, there is a music video of ""Till the End of Time"" by Devotchka and a Soundtrack Spot. On Side B are 4 alternate endings (5 min) with optional directors' commentary. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French.",5,"Funny & Genuine, this Quirky Family Dramedy Rises Above the Cliches.",1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,2644,"['am', 'hard', 'movies', 'quirky', 'characters', 'obligatory', 'dysfunctional', 'families', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'chains', 'tired', 'cliches', 'strung', 'end', 'end', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'vibrant', 'genuine', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'quirky', 'indie', 'relationship', 'films', 'Richard', 'Hoover', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'frustrated', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'high', 'hopes', 'book', 'deal', 'When', '7-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Olive', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'accepted', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Pageant', 'family', 'make', 'sure', 'opportunity', 'pursue', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'dreams', 'wife', 'Sheryl', 'Toni', 'Colette', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drive', 'stick', 'shift', 'Uncle', 'Frank', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'Grandpa', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Olive', 'talent', 'coach', 'silent', 'teenaged', 'brother', 'Dwayne', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'just', 'put', 'upon', 'pile', 'family', 'yellow', 'VW', 'minibus', 'drive', 'Olive', '700', 'miles', 'California.Owing', 'Michael', 'Arndt', 'heartfelt', 'script', 'wonderful', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'hilarious', 'credible', 'emotional', 'level', 'characters', 'are', 'active', 'deliberate', 'never', 'reactive', 'never', 'played', 'laughs', 'interplay', 'several', 'generations', 'characters', 'demeaning', 'marginalizing', 'always', 'wonders', 'relationship', 'dramas', 'middle-aged', 'parents', 'delinquent', 'grandpa', 'optimistic', 'child', 'morose', 'teen', 'are', 'fully-realized', 'equally', 'interesting', 'people', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'never', 'contrived', 'even', 'could', 'hardly', 'be', 'moreso', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'cliches', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'family', 'actually', 'functions', 'very', 'well', 'end', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'liking', 'people', 'laughing', 'way', 'California.The', 'DVD', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', '2006', '2-sided', 'disc', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'Side', 'A', 'widescreen', 'Side', 'B', 'are', '2', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'side', 'disc', 'first', 'audio', 'commentary', 'husband', 'wife', 'directing', 'team', 'Jonathan', 'Dayton', 'Valerie', 'Faris', 'discuss', 'film', 'tone', 'casting', 'filming', 'van', 'actors', 'sets', 'more', 'second', 'commentary', 'screenwriter', 'Michael', 'Arndt', 'directors', 'Dayton', 'Faris', 'more', 'characters', 'dialogue', 'commentary', 'lot', 'repetition', 'commentaries', 'so', 'want', 'listen', 'one', 'recommend', 'writer/directors', 'commentary', 'Also', 'Side', 'A', 'music', 'video', 'Till', 'End', 'Time', 'Devotchka', 'Soundtrack', 'Spot', 'Side', 'B', 'are', '4', 'alternate', 'endings', '5', 'min', 'optional', 'directors', 'commentary', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'film', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French']",N/A

The family members include the sweet, innocent daughter who adores her grandfather; the grandfather, a sometimes bitter World War II vet with a penchant for lasciviousness but who has a tender heart benath his prickly, surly manner; a disaffected teenage son who reads Nietzsche and refuses to speak because he hates his family; the rattled mother who spends all her time trying to keep the family chaos under control; a down-on-his-luck father, who battling with finances, tries to lift himself and his family with a self-help book and cheery bromides that feebly cushion his fall to despair; an uncle who, scorned by his lover and losing his professorial job, fails in his bid to commit suicide. As this ragtag team of misfits travels to California, they deal with their personality clashes and fall into one comic mishap after another.The theme of this film is that American's have a very adolescent, immature notion of success, which is all or nothing. We must, the film shows us, reject society's superficial notions of being a ""winner"" and carve out our own niche by finding out what we really love as we remain indifferent to society's meretricious definitions of glamour and success. This screwball comedy is not your cynical life is hell with no redemption variety.

Richard has driven the family to the edge of financial ruin with his dream of becoming the next Tony Robbins. The launch-point of Richard's career is a self-help book he desperately needs to publish. His wife, Sheryl (Toni Collette) wrestles to hold her fragile family together and occasionally resents the task. The eldest son, Dwayne (Paul Dano), is a self-proclaimed disciple of Nietzsche who wears anti-Jesus T-Shirts and has taken a vow of silence. Concentrating the levels of zaniness the family is Richard's heroine addicted father (Alan Arkin) who occupies a bedroom after being evicted from the nursing home. Last but not least is Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carell), a suicidal, homosexual Proust scholar.The lone source of innocence and joy in the home rests in Olive (Abigail Berslin). Olive is somewhat chubby girl with the nave dream of entering and winning a beauty contest. It's this dream that forces the entire family to interrupt their ruts, pile into the family VW van and make the two-day journey to the tournament.The movie opens with Richard indoctrinating Olive with the pressure-packed words ""The world is divided into winners and losers."" However, the journey is filled with zany encounters that force each family member to confront his or her personal measure of success. When the family arrives at the beauty contest they realize that they've led Olive to be harshly evaluated by judges and contestants alike. The family rallies to protect Olive and hilarity ensues.Little Miss Sunshine beautifully portrays the power of family to protect and nurture, even when one, or in this case several, of the parts are broken and vulnerable. Still, it's the movie's portrayal of human brokenness that should give parents pause before allowing a teen to view this movie--the language is often foul, viewers repeatedly observe a character handling pornography, and grandpa is spotted snorting a line of cocaine.Little Miss Sunshine earned four Oscar nominations: Best Picture, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role (Alan Arkin), Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role (Abigail Berslin), and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen (Michael Arndt).MOVIEBLOG RECOMMENDS:Thought not for everyone, many parents and mature teens may enjoy the depiction - and ultimate family redemption - of the flawed characters in Little Miss Sunshine.AFTER THE SHOW:* How have you experienced the tension between the drive for success and family?* How has your family provided protection for each other in the past?* Some say the very first dysfunctional family was Adam & Eve.

Every character in this film is achingly real and actually in the end more healthy than a lot of seemingly strong familial relationships.While put off by the constant use of the ""F-Word"", if one can get past it, the story pretty much sells itself.  Using the vehicle (no pun intended) of the roadtrip as ""close-quarters"" therapy for the whole family was tremendous.  Steve Carrell was outstanding in this film in particular.I recognized the little girl from ""Signs"" where she was also very good.  Innocence impersonating what she assumed was a performance imagined from the loving mind of her grandfather on stage was a revelation.  Sticking together, binding to those that love you is an important aspect of this film.  Unconditional love takes a back seat through most of this film however and surfaces just as things go whirling out of control.The older brother, wearing a t-shirt stating ""Jesus was Wrong"" again turned my stomach a bit but, being a Christian, I understand the attacks we must undertake in His Name.  Yes, I am a Christian and yes I loved this movie.  I do not endorse all aspects of the film but I must say this film healed wounds that I never knew I had entirely.If I can say one thing to someone considering this movie, it is ""give it a chance"".  Many believers shy away from some films because of language, (myself being one of them) but sometimes we miss out on a great piece of film that can touch us in many ways.  ""Life as a House"" springs to mind.However, if language offends you so much that you can't get through the film, this is not the film for you.

The film tells the story of the Hoover family - success-obsessed dad Richard (Greg Kinnear), harried mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), wide-eyed (and completely precious) daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin), suicidal Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell, in a BRILLIANT turn), a heroin-snorting grandpa (Alan Arkin), and (finally) iron-pumping older brother Dwayne, who has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Air Force Academy. Due to a fluke, little Olive is invited to participate in the hotly contested ""Little Miss Sunshine"" pageant in California. The family loads into their dated VW van to make the several hundred mile trek to get Olive to the competition on time.While there is certainly enough plot to go around, this is primarily a character piece. We see Richard realize that his preoccupation with being a ""winner"" is awfully detrimental and none too forgiving. We watch as Frank copes with being dumped by his lover and surpassed by his professional colleagues. We see Dwayne's dream to be a pilot threatened. And through all of the family's losses, we watch them prop each other up and realize that losing isn't really all that bad, as long as you have some good company.EVERYONE in the cast brought their A-game, but the two standouts for me were Breslin and Carrell. Breslin was absolutely adorable as little Olive, who has no reason to believe she can't win the pageant. And she is so trusting and vulnerable that I was totally hooked. Carrell as the jilted gay academic proves once again that he is a veritable Proteus. The guy has range. His melancholy recovery from depression is something to see - smart, likable, witty, in other words, someone we really want to keep around. As odd as it sounds, Frank is, in many ways, the straight man of the piece. (Ha!)At any rate, you will love this movie.

It's more subtle and sophisticated than people seem to give it credit for.  It's funny but I wouldn't call it a comedy; it's has plenty of angst and failure but I wouldn't call it a tragedy (or melodrama, or whatever).Each character is dysfunctional but not to such a degree as to be unbelievable (a la ""Running with Scissors"").  They each have their own personal conflict to overcome but they are each defeated by it (except the little girl).  Even though the characters all fail, they do still emerge stronger and more unified as a family because of it.  (It just occurred to me--one of the characters is always reading Nietzsche, who popularized the quote ""that which does not kill me makes me stronger."")LMS is not a ""comedy"" (although often funny--ESPECIALLY the ending); it's not a National Lampoon roadtrip movie; it's not ""glorifying dysfunction"" (as another reviewer posted); it's not a social commentary about the exploitive and pseudo-sexual industry of child beauty pageants.

1029583,A22PV91A5CNOGO,B000JU9OJ4,"NY film buff ""A reader from NY, NY""","[3, 5]","The mother of all comically dysfunctional families hits the road in an equally dysfunctional VW bus in this funny, off-beat, charming film about a group of people who--despite their differences and personality quirks--can come together in support of each other when the situation calls for it. Cleverly directed and brilliantly acted, the movie boasts a humorous plot (sometimes predictable, but always entertaining), and some of the best ensemble work of the year (2007). Greg Kinnear is moving and spot-on as the father, Richard Hoover, a determined would-be self-help guru who enthusiastically pitches his nine-step program to potential buyers while his own family members flounder about in various states of depression, unrequited love, professional failure, and teenage angst. Toni Collette is Sheryl, the caring mom, who supports everyone's ambition whether it is healthy or not. Alan Arkin's performance as the foul-mouthed grandfather deservedly won the veteran screen and stage actor an Oscar. Steve Carell is excellent in the role of Frank, Sheryl's suicidal brother, a gay Proust scholar and professor whose inamorato, a handsome grad student, has taken up with a rival prof. The youngest member of the family is seven year old Olive, wonderfully acted by Abigail Breslin, for whose sake the quarreling Hoovers pile into the VW and head for a little girl beauty pageant in California. Finally, the Nietzche-obsessed, emo teenage son Duane, brilliantly perfomed by Paul Dano, very nearly steals the show with his temper-tantrum scene in the back of the family bus.The actors are so good that it is difficult to single out any one performance as outshining all the others. I have never been a big fan of Greg Kinnear, but he impressed me and was truly superb as a man on the brink of bankruptcy who attempts to remain positive-thinking and ebulliant in the face of failure. It was a pleasure to see Steve Carell in a semi-serious roll, his verbal exchanges with Richard and Grandpa in the bus, and with Duane at the beach in California, are funny and sensitively-handled at the same time. Abigail Breslin is perfect as the wannabe beauty-pageant queen. Her earnestness and genuinely childlike spirit are seen to good effect against the glitzy backdrop of a beauty contest in which simpering children with bouffant hair, layers of makeup, and frothy girly-girl costumes a la JonBenet Ramsey pose provocatively and strut the length of a mini-catwalk. About Paul Dano a great deal has been said in connection with his work in ""There Will Be Blood."" He is a superb young actor with an impressive range, and his surly, sulky teenage Duane provides the film with some of its best moments.Admitttedly there are one or two moments when the predictability of the plot can be a bit much, but this is more than made up for by the film's hilarious conclusion which is anything but predictable, as well as uplifting and moving.In reading some of the reviews below I was amazed to see that there were viewers who found the movie ""distasteful,"" ""disgusting,"" or ""dirty."" These individuals are clearly close cousins to some of our worst (and most humorless) Puritan forebears, and should probably pack up and head for seventeenth-century Salem as soon as they're able.",5,"Quirky, off-beat, brilliant indie pic",1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,3261,"['mother', 'comically', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'road', 'equally', 'dysfunctional', 'VW', 'bus', 'funny', 'off-beat', 'charming', 'film', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'differences', 'personality', 'quirks', 'can', 'come', 'together', 'support', 'other', 'when', 'situation', 'Cleverly', 'directed', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'movie', 'humorous', 'plot', 'sometimes', 'predictable', 'always', 'entertaining', 'best', 'ensemble', 'work', 'year', '2007', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'moving', 'spot-on', 'father', 'Richard', 'Hoover', 'determined', 'would-be', 'self-help', 'guru', 'who', 'enthusiastically', 'nine-step', 'program', 'potential', 'buyers', 'own', 'family', 'members', 'flounder', 'various', 'states', 'depression', 'unrequited', 'love', 'professional', 'failure', 'teenage', 'angst', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Sheryl', 'caring', 'mom', 'who', 'everyone', 'ambition', 'healthy', 'not', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'performance', 'foul-mouthed', 'grandfather', 'deservedly', 'won', 'veteran', 'screen', 'stage', 'actor', 'Oscar', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'excellent', 'role', 'Frank', 'Sheryl', 'suicidal', 'brother', 'gay', 'Proust', 'scholar', 'professor', 'inamorato', 'handsome', 'grad', 'student', 'taken', 'up', 'rival', 'prof', 'youngest', 'member', 'family', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'Olive', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'sake', 'quarreling', 'Hoovers', 'pile', 'VW', 'head', 'little', 'girl', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'California', 'Finally', 'Nietzche-obsessed', 'emo', 'teenage', 'son', 'Duane', 'brilliantly', 'perfomed', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'very', 'nearly', 'show', 'temper-tantrum', 'scene', 'back', 'family', 'bus.The', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'difficult', 'single', 'out', 'one', 'performance', 'outshining', 'others', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'impressed', 'was', 'truly', 'superb', 'man', 'brink', 'bankruptcy', 'who', 'remain', 'positive-thinking', 'ebulliant', 'face', 'failure', 'was', 'pleasure', 'see', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'semi-serious', 'roll', 'verbal', 'exchanges', 'Richard', 'Grandpa', 'bus', 'Duane', 'beach', 'California', 'are', 'funny', 'sensitively-handled', 'same', 'time', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'perfect', 'wannabe', 'beauty-pageant', 'queen', 'earnestness', 'genuinely', 'childlike', 'spirit', 'are', 'seen', 'good', 'effect', 'glitzy', 'backdrop', 'beauty', 'contest', 'simpering', 'children', 'bouffant', 'hair', 'layers', 'makeup', 'frothy', 'girly-girl', 'costumes', 'la', 'JonBenet', 'Ramsey', 'pose', 'provocatively', 'strut', 'length', 'mini-catwalk', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'great', 'deal', 'been', 'said', 'connection', 'work', 'Will', 'Be', 'Blood', 'superb', 'young', 'actor', 'impressive', 'range', 'surly', 'sulky', 'teenage', 'Duane', 'film', 'best', 'moments.Admitttedly', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'moments', 'when', 'predictability', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'film', 'hilarious', 'conclusion', 'anything', 'predictable', 'as', 'well', 'uplifting', 'moving.In', 'reading', 'reviews', 'was', 'amazed', 'see', 'were', 'viewers', 'who', 'found', 'movie', 'distasteful', 'disgusting', 'dirty', 'individuals', 'are', 'clearly', 'close', 'cousins', 'worst', 'most', 'humorless', 'Puritan', 'forebears', 'should', 'probably', 'pack', 'up', 'head', 'seventeenth-century', 'Salem', 'as', 'soon', ""'re"", 'able']",N/A

Alas, the only way to get there from New Mexico where she lives with her totally dysfunctional (but amazingly endearing) family is by road and so to the road it is, with the mother who serves her family take-away southern fried chicken every day for dinner and doesn't seem to feel there's anything wrong with it, the father who's staring bankruptcy in the face while desperately (but futilely) trying to sell some silly self-help idea, the brother who's taken a vow of silence in a bid to get into the air force, the suicidal genius uncle fresh out of the psychiatric ward and last but not least, the grandpa who snorts heroin to help pass his time in retirement. People, we have the makings of a cross-country journey of a lifetime.I loved every minute and actually learned a few lessons from it:1. True beauty is absolutely what's inside a person and not what's on the outside and in this day and age, this is definitely a message we should ensure our children hear from us.2. A family of misfits and neurotics that love and support each other is still a loving and supportive family.3. A loser isn't someone who doesn't win; it's someone who's so afraid of losing he doesn't even try. (And this one has particular personal relevance).This is a family road trip movie with a difference. Great acting from Greg Kinnear, Toni Collete, Paul Dano, Steve Carell, Alan Arkin, the wonderful little Abigail Breslin as Olive and last but by no means least, that plucky yellow VW van. Despite a myriad of continuity and geographical goofs - see how many you can spot - directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris have put together a fantastic piece of art here. My heart was in my mouth for Olive towards the end, when the silly beauty pageant finally takes place but the ending was not just totally unexpected it ended up being terrifically heart-warming. Sometimes these little indie films are simply the best. Definitely one to own as I will want to watch this again.""Little Miss Sunshine"" has earned well-deserved Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay Oscar nominations as well as Best Spporting Actor and Actress nominations for Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin.Not much in the DVD extras, just special features that offer directors' commentary and alternate endings with optional director's commentary.",5,Twisted family + twisted road trip + emotional highs and lows = pure entertainment!,1171929600,"02 20, 2007",2007,2470,"['Little', '7', 'year', 'old', 'Olive', 'Hoover', 'discovers', 'screeching', 'delight', 'won', 'place', 'finals', ""'Little"", 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'California', 'Alas', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'there', 'New', 'Mexico', 'where', 'totally', 'dysfunctional', 'amazingly', 'endearing', 'family', 'road', 'so', 'road', 'mother', 'who', 'family', 'take-away', 'southern', 'fried', 'chicken', 'day', 'dinner', ""n't"", 'seem', 'feel', 'anything', 'wrong', 'father', 'who', 'staring', 'bankruptcy', 'face', 'desperately', 'futilely', 'trying', 'sell', 'silly', 'self-help', 'idea', 'brother', 'who', 'taken', 'vow', 'silence', 'bid', 'get', 'air', 'force', 'suicidal', 'genius', 'uncle', 'fresh', 'psychiatric', 'ward', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'grandpa', 'who', 'heroin', 'help', 'pass', 'time', 'retirement', 'People', 'have', 'makings', 'cross-country', 'journey', 'lifetime.I', 'loved', 'minute', 'actually', 'learned', 'few', 'lessons', 'it:1', 'True', 'beauty', 'absolutely', 'what', 'inside', 'person', 'not', 'what', 'outside', 'day', 'age', 'definitely', 'message', 'should', 'ensure', 'children', 'hear', 'us.2', 'family', 'misfits', 'neurotics', 'love', 'support', 'other', 'still', 'loving', 'supportive', 'family.3', 'loser', ""n't"", 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'win', 'someone', 'who', 'so', 'afraid', 'losing', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'one', 'particular', 'personal', 'relevance', '.This', 'family', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'difference', 'Great', 'acting', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Toni', 'Collete', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'wonderful', 'little', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Olive', 'last', 'means', 'least', 'plucky', 'yellow', 'VW', 'van', 'myriad', 'continuity', 'geographical', 'goofs', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'can', 'spot', 'directors', 'Jonathan', 'Dayton', 'Valerie', 'Faris', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'fantastic', 'piece', 'art', 'here', 'My', 'heart', 'was', 'mouth', 'Olive', 'towards', 'end', 'when', 'silly', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'finally', 'place', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'terrifically', 'heart-warming', 'Sometimes', 'little', 'indie', 'films', 'are', 'simply', 'best', 'Definitely', 'one', 'own', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'earned', 'well-deserved', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'as', 'well', 'Best', 'Spporting', 'Actor', 'Actress', 'nominations', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Abigail', 'Breslin.Not', 'much', 'DVD', 'extras', 'just', 'special', 'features', 'offer', 'directors', 'commentary', 'alternate', 'endings', 'optional', 'director', 'commentary']",N/A

This regular & repeated dangerous activity and its symbolism are great.The movie explores the idea that at some point, someone you love will want something that 'everyone' else thinks is inappropriate.

What it turned out to be was a film that felt like a jumble of ideas crammed into one movie. I quote Peter Griffin""It insists on itself"". Every single character has too many quirks. Greg Kinnear is trying to become a self help guru. Paul Dano's Character is taking a vow of silence. Abigail Breslin plays a chubby girl who is picked at the last minute to be in a preteen beauty pagent. Steve Carell plays Toni Collette's gay brother who just tried to commit suicide. Alan Arkin plays the heroin addicted grandfather who teaches his granddaughter(spoiler)to dance like a stripper for the pagent. Throw this wacky bunch of characters into a VW bus and watch hijinx insue. It felt like one of those horrible spoof movies made by the guys who did Disaster Movie and Meet the Spartans.

Yet the beauty pageant in question is merely a catalyst for a family to realize its own shortcomings and unite and agreee on...something.Greg Kinear is a father who is banking on the success of a 12 step self help program while his wife played by Toni Collette is putting up with the uncertainty of their future along with the suicide attempt by her brother played by Steve Carell. His character is a college professor who attempts suicide because of unrequited love from a fellow colleague. Paul Dano is the son who aspires to be an air force pilot whilst looking up to Nietsche and outright proclaiming his hatred for his family.  Alan Arkin is a profanity spewing and drug taking grandfather.  Somewhere in the midst of this, Olive, the young dauther, seems oblivious to the dysfuntion going on and just wants to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Paegant.The road trip that ensues plays on their dysfunction, with witty exchanges between the talented performers.  The chemistry between Paul Dano and Steve Carrel is most affecting, despite the fact that Paul Dano doesn't talk for a good 2/3 of the film.All of the characters have aspirations they can't quite achieve - like a desire overeaching their actual potential.  This is perhaps the most original concept the film has to offer.  In the end, it's ultimately about failure which is a sad concept for a comedy to address.  That the film is so funny and makes you feel so good at the end is an amazing feat.

This surprised me; I would have expected it to have been made at Disney.  The story is nothing special although there are some genuinely funny moments.What saves it and earns my four stars here is the excellent cast.  Greg Kinnear is always terrific, in my book.  Alan Arkin gives the performance only an old master can do.  Abigail Breslin is truly Little Miss Sunshine;it's great to see a child's performance that isn't overly adorable.  Steve Carrell is very good in what had to be a difficult role, rising from his suicidal despair to life before our eyes. Paul Dano is good too as the suffering teenager.  I am not a big fan of Toni Collette.  Somehow she is too good at playing disagreeable, to make me warm up to her character.  But she does sweeten up a bit in the end.As other reviewers have mentioned there are some things that are too improbable for us to take the film seriously, such as the fact that no one but grandpa has bothered to see the child's act.  I think that what bothered me the most was the stereotyped way of presenting most of the characters. We are clearly shown who the good guys and the bad guys are, in the eyes of the writers, and personally I find that annoying.  We're supposed to love the long suffering mom but I found her to be a dismal crank who has nothing but ridicule for her husband.  We're supposed to hate the dad but he is the one who by sheer force of will, pulls the family through all of the set-backs.More cliches:  the stupid cop, the superficial folks at the beauty pagent, the cold hearted ""bereavement counselor"" etc.  Yeah, there's some truth in all of that, I suppose, but it detracts from the overall value of the film for me.  If this were just a screwball farce, then fine, but we are asked to take it seriously and the heavy handedness of the writers in telling us who we're supposed to cheer and who to boo, leaves me a bit disgusted.

I expected this total feel good experience where everyone's dreams come true. Instead the film tells a story that is as opposite as it get's. I wouldn't call it a basic comedy because it really is more of a drama than a comedy. Through the entire film everything that could possibly go wrong for the characters does. The film deals with attempted suicide, death, heroin addiction, hopes and dreams nearly or completely destroyed, positive thinking rendering a less than desirable result, frustration, and basically what ends up being a movie filled with depressing subject matter. I enjoyed the film for what it was, but at the same time I was left wondering what the point was. Was it attempting to send the message that nothing goes right no matter how bad you believe it will go right? Was it saying ""Hey, this is life. Yea it sucks, but here's a story about just how bad it can suck and the people involved can appreciate how much it sucks""?

I caught on quickly that this is not your ordinary movie and I soon realized that anything could happen.  This is a story of a hopelessly dysfunctional family whose many seperate parts find a most unusal way of coming together.  You can see it coming and it really becomes rather impressive to watch.  However, this film disappointed me in how it ended.I was bothered by the portrayal of the phoney plastic young girls in the Little Miss Sunshine.  Let's face it, movies and TV stereotype just about everything. For some groups it has been a real issue.  However, when was the last time you saw a pageant portrayed as a number of young ladies striving to become the best that they could be with every participant exiting the event as a better person than when they started?  I've attended a lot of pageants over the years (thanks primarily because our town annually hosts the state's Miss America contest).  The reality of the quality of the participants has always impressed me as far exceeding the demeaning stereotype that permeants society's general impressions.  Maybe it's an overblown reation but it bothered me how the movie strayed from what I saw as a theme of how to become a success.  All of the film's  unusual family members had failed to achieve their goals except for our young and endearing heroine.  How the movie treated her moment on the stage really bothered me.  Otherwise, this is an enjoyable albeit unusual film.I guess I should acknowledge that the message of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" might possibly be that the problem with chasing our dreams is that they can turn into nightmares.  Be happy with what life allots you while laughing at those who haven't yet had their comeuppance.  This could have been such a better movie!

And you wouldn't let a suicidal gay ""uncle"" sleep in the same bedroom with a 15-year old emotionally unstable boy. The stories told on Oprah and Jerry Springer, or even news reports about JonBenet Ramsey or Michael Jackson could hint you that such parental negligence practiced in real life might turn perilous.As the tale unfolds, it appears to be not parental carelessness but 100% pure political correctness version 2006/2007 at its finest. So I'm not surprised about the nominations for rewards the movie got. However, I'm still surprised that this was categorized as comedy. There is a broken erratically honking horn in the movie, probably meant to be hilarious, but I kept thinking, wouldn't it occur to the travelers just yank a wire from it at the first stop? And I answered my own question: well, yes but the movie wouldn't be a comedy anymore.""Comedies"" with excessive foul language aren't amusing. The potty-mouth language used throughout the movie isn't doing it any good. It's probably a desperate attempt at ""reality."" But in reality very few families use this kind of language on daily basis and still fewer use it in presence of 7-year old kids.

Ms. Breslin's and Mr. Arkin's Oscar noms speak for themselves, but Kinnear, Carrell, Paul Dano and, especially, Toni Collette are so in touch with their material that Ms. Breslin's only task is to be reactionary, which she does beautifully and naturally. I HATE bad kid-actors and she won me over. There's fire and wisdom behind those beautiful, spectacled eyes, and when she lets loose at the end, you simply HAVE to cheer. I'm glad it won the Ensemble Cast award at SAG, though I doubt it will win Best Picture at the Oscars, if only because the directors weren't nominated. The clever screenplay of Michael Arndt may be its only chance of a win. Dysfunctional families have inundated our films lately, but I can't think of one recently that had me believing that such families could be as entertaining. Indeed, the plot is outrageous, pitting one obstacle against another, but the ending is satisfying and appropriate. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a small, easy to watch film, and though some previous reviewers were offended by the foul language, I thought it was representational of the characters' state at the moment. Yes, people do talk like that a lot. Lighten up, folks... I had a good time, and laughed a lot. I also felt for the characters, something I can't always say. Due to its popularity, it almost screams for a sequel. I hope they leave it alone, and let it stand by itself. Further interventions into the lives of these characters might be overkill.

1029612,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B000JU9OJ4,RMurray847,"[3, 5]","LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE (LMS) is a wonderful example of a movie that has many moments that make you want to laugh and cry at the same time...both for legitimate reasons.  Why do I think this is a notable accomplishment?  Because I think you have to really care about the characters to reach that point.  When outrageous things happen to characters you don't care much about...you'll just laugh.  And if the circumstances are too horrific, and you care about the characters, you'll cry.  This movie walks the line, and that isn't easy.LMS is about a fairly typical ""indie-movie-dysfunctional family.""  A loser father who tries to teach empowerment workshops (Greg Kinear), his wife (Toni Collette) who is the closest thing to a voice of reason, their young daughter (Abigail Breslin, who is a finalist in a young-girl's beauty pageant...but has no business being).  There's also Collette's longer teenage son (who has taken a vow of silence...THAT'S something we've never seen a teen do in the movies!!!) And Colette's suicidal gay brother who is Proust scholar (Steve Carell).  Rounding out the group is Kinear's cantankerous old father (Alan Arkin), who has been kicked out of his retirement community for doing drugs.  So, the movie loses some points for lack of an original group of characters. Indie movies are alway SO interested in quirky people...but after two decades of post-Sex, Lies & Videotape independence...we've seen all the ""new"" archetypes before.The movie is about the family's eventful roadtrip from Albuquerque (my home town and current residence) to SoCal for the contest...and then the contest itself.  The trip is undertaken in an old VW bus, which early on, loses its clutch, and can thus only run in 3rd and 4th gear.  This leads to some very amusing and somehow touching moments with all these characters push-starting the car and then one by one, leaping into the open door!  This is creative (and very believable if you've ever owned a VW!).Most of the film chronicles the journey, which includes moments both ridiculous and sad (as I said above).  Plans go awry.  You can feel the sweat of impending despair.  Then, they arrive, and the contest itself is almost like another movie.  It becomes as much a comment on the beauty pageant industry as anything else.  This part, while amusing, deflates some of the power the film was building towards...and the ""climactic"" scene wants to be sublime, but is only mildly pleasing.  We've had our tone jarred too much.I don't want you to think I didn't like the film.  Most of it is excellent, primarily because of the outstanding performances.  Alan Arkin is always great (in my opinion, he's the single greatest film actor never to win an Oscar...I will pretty much see anything he's in.)  Greg Kinear, doing another take on his ""decent loser"" is in fine form.  His character generates equal amounts of pity and frustration...and that's exactly what it should do!  Toni Collette is another performer who can seemingly do no wrong...including one of the most convincing American accents ever done by an Australian.  She is simply a terrific actress.  Steve Carell steals the show in many ways.  His character undergoes the most growth, and in some ways, the most pain.  Yet Carell hardly changes expressions.  (Although I must say that when Carell smiles, he has a wonderful, glowing, innocent smile that cannot help but make you feel better.)  His performance is very internal, deep, and best of all...really, really funny.  He's so different here than in THE OFFICE, or BRUCE ALMIGHTY.  If anyone thought his string of success is a fluke...think again...this guy is the real deal.So I heartily recommend the film for its richness (even when it descends into cliche...it's heartfelt) and the great acting.  Frankly, that's enough right there.  It is R-rated for some obscene rants by the grandfather...but for all that, it feels strangely innocent.And for natives of Albuquerque...none of the film was shot in New Mexico, and it shows.  Even the interior shots don't ""feel"" like a house you would see in Albuquerque.

This fact has never been more substantiated than by Little Miss Sunshine, a very funny movie that also is thought-provoking and moving.Though this movie seems a little light on the plot, it is the excellent ensemble of the six family members that make it what it is. Basically, when little Olive (Abigail Breslin) finds out that she has won a beauty pageant and thus can compete in the prestigious Little Miss Sunshine pageant, her family and her pile into their VW Bus in order to drive to California. Consisting of her failing motivational speaker father Richard (Greg Kinnear, habitually silent brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), drug addict grandfather (Alan Arkin), mother Sheryl (Toni Collete), and depressed suicidal uncle Frank (Steve Carell), the family and the antics they share are classic. From the Bus that won't start without everyone pushing and then jumping on, to the frustration of Richard's business attempts, the subplots and backgrounds of each character are very engaging and keep you hooked.So, I highly recommend Little Miss Sunshine.

1029614,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B000JU9OJ4,Robert I. Hedges,"[4, 5]","""Little Miss Sunshine"" has a brilliant cast and contains moments of pure genius. The story follows the exploits of a troubled suburban family as they drive across the country to enter their seven year old daughter in the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" pageant. I am a big fan of both Greg Kinnear and Steve Carell, but in this case I think Carell did the better job as a formerly suicidal professor (and America's number one Proust expert). My favorite scenes in the film were of the interactions between Carell and Paul Dano as a angst-ridden teenager who has taken a vow of silence related to his desire to become an Air Force pilot (you'll have to watch the film for all the confusing details.) Dano and Carell manage to be both genuinely disturbed and genuinely touching, especially late in the movie.The plot is more than a bit contrived and formulaic, although the last ten minutes were rather unpredictable. I found the film to get off to a very slow start, and the pace to be somewhat plodding throughout, although the last half hour is more captivating than the first hour. Although this is a movie about a family, this is not a family film, and the R rating is there for several reasons, not the least of which are very mature themes, and excessively foul language, especially from Alan Arkin. I was extremely pleased, though, that the film skewered the unfortunate scourge of sub-teen beauty pageants: I was genuinely creeped out by the young contestants (and their families.) The conclusion of the pageant was shocking and, while amusing, made a serious comment on contemporary mores.The cast is talented, and the critiques of modern society, particularly the exposure of the false values of the winner and loser, are frequently on the money if you look past the superficial veneer of the movie as strictly a comedy. Despite the obvious talent that went into the movie, I was less enthusiastic than I expected, given my respect for the cast members: the pacing was often slow (particularly at the outset), and the script was full of gratuitous exchanges seemingly placed simply for shock value and a cheap laugh (e.g. Arkin's diatribe to Dano about virility) that went far beyond what was necessary to establish the lack of functional cohesiveness as a family unit. There are moments of unadulterated brilliance in the film, but it is by no means deserving of the highly effusive praise from such luminous sources as ""Newsweek"" and ""USA Today.""",3,"""Sarcasm Is The Refuge Of Losers.""",1233792000,"02 5, 2009",2009,2448,"['Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'moments', 'pure', 'genius', 'story', 'exploits', 'troubled', 'suburban', 'family', 'drive', 'country', 'enter', 'seven', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'pageant', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'case', 'think', 'Carell', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'formerly', 'suicidal', 'professor', 'America', 'number', 'one', 'Proust', 'expert', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'film', 'were', 'interactions', 'Carell', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'angst-ridden', 'teenager', 'who', 'taken', 'vow', 'silence', 'related', 'desire', 'become', 'Air', 'Force', 'pilot', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'film', 'confusing', 'details', 'Dano', 'Carell', 'manage', 'be', 'genuinely', 'disturbed', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'especially', 'late', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'more', 'bit', 'contrived', 'formulaic', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'were', 'rather', 'unpredictable', 'found', 'film', 'get', 'off', 'very', 'slow', 'start', 'pace', 'be', 'somewhat', 'plodding', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'more', 'captivating', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'family', 'not', 'family', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'there', 'several', 'reasons', 'not', 'least', 'are', 'very', 'mature', 'themes', 'excessively', 'foul', 'language', 'especially', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'was', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'though', 'film', 'skewered', 'unfortunate', 'scourge', 'sub-teen', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'was', 'genuinely', 'creeped', 'out', 'young', 'contestants', 'families', 'conclusion', 'pageant', 'was', 'shocking', 'amusing', 'made', 'serious', 'comment', 'contemporary', 'mores.The', 'cast', 'talented', 'critiques', 'modern', 'society', 'particularly', 'exposure', 'false', 'values', 'winner', 'loser', 'are', 'frequently', 'money', 'look', 'superficial', 'veneer', 'movie', 'strictly', 'comedy', 'obvious', 'talent', 'went', 'movie', 'was', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'expected', 'given', 'respect', 'cast', 'members', 'pacing', 'was', 'often', 'slow', 'particularly', 'outset', 'script', 'was', 'full', 'gratuitous', 'exchanges', 'seemingly', 'placed', 'simply', 'shock', 'value', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'e.g', 'Arkin', 'diatribe', 'Dano', 'virility', 'went', 'far', 'what', 'was', 'necessary', 'establish', 'lack', 'functional', 'cohesiveness', 'family', 'unit', 'are', 'moments', 'unadulterated', 'brilliance', 'film', 'means', 'deserving', 'highly', 'effusive', 'praise', 'such', 'luminous', 'sources', 'Newsweek', 'USA', 'Today']",N/A
1029615,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000JU9OJ4,Robert Moore,"[5, 8]","This is one of the finest low budget indie comedies you are ever likely to see and the finest I have seen since NAPOLEON DYNAMITE.  For a ""small"" film this one has a surprisingly strong cast and I would love to know how the producers managed to get so many fine individuals together for this project.  There is no star of the film, but an ensemble cast in which each performer has to carry his or her weight.  Probably the hottest performer in the film at the moment is Steve Carell, who here plays a suicidal Proust scholar and former professor who is grieving over losing a grad student he was in love with to another Proust scholar.  Anyone going to see the film hoping to see Carell as he was in THE 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN is going to be crushed, but those open to something unexpected will be delighted.  The very gifted Toni Collette, who does her usual fine job as the mother in an exceptionally dysfunctional family, plays his sister.  ""Dysfunctional"" might actually be a weak term, since ""chaotic"" might be better.  Most of the film turns around the attempt to get her daughter Olive to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California, a long drive via Volkswagen bus from their home in New Mexico.  One of the joys of the film is Abigail Breslin's performance as Olive, who while cute as a button is not traditional beauty pageant material.  Many will remember her from SIGNS as Mel Gibson's young daughter.  Greg Kinnear, a rather harried motivational speaker who hopes to achieve great success through his 9-Step plan to become a winner, plays her father.  Alan Arkin plays his father in an absolutely hysterical performance as the lewd, vulgar, and unselfconscious heroin-sniffing grandfather.  Rounding out the family is Dwayne, played wonderfully by Paul Dano.  In the preview that I saw, Dano may have been responsible for many of the loudest laughs from the audience.  Dwayne is a hostilely independent teen who has taken a vow of silence until he manages to get into the Air Force Academy to pursue his dream of becoming a test pilot.  When his uncle Frank (Carell) asks him if he has many friends Dwayne scribbles on a notepad, ""I hate everybody,"" then takes time to underline ""everybody"" after Frank reads the note.The ordeals the family experiences are all original and exceedingly funny.  I won't spoil the adventure by recounting them, but I was struck throughout by how original the humor was.  Virtually none of the humor was recycled or flat.  There are a host of great scenes that any viewer will remember vividly.After another summer of mind-numbing films that attempt to be blockbusters but only manage to depress, this film will be a tonic.  A long time ago Hollywood seemed to forget that more often than not less is more.  While this is a ""small"" film, it manages to be infinitely funnier than any of its larger-budgeted competitors.  It could also quite possibly end up the funniest movie of 2006.I did have one quibble with the film.  I thought the last few minutes were a bit of a disappointment.  Without revealing precisely what happened, I thought the reactions of all the characters were a bit hard to buy.

1029618,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000JU9OJ4,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 7]","Death, drug addiction, attempted suicide, emotional instability - these are just a few of the elements that make up what is fast turning into the sleeper hit comedy of 2006 - ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" in which an extended family of six piles into its rickety minivan and takes a thousand mile road trip from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Newport Beach, California, so that their daughter can compete in a beauty pageant for pre-teen girls. Needless to say, the family experiences many colorful and lesson-instilling adventures along the way.The characters, for the most part, fall into that category that anyone familiar with independent movie-making will instantly recognize as the ""photogenically dysfunctional."" That is to say each has his own individualized ""quirk"" stamped onto his character to make him both ""weird"" and ""recognizable"" at the same time. The father, Frank (Greg Kinnear), is a win-at-all-costs motivational speaker who has designed a nine-step program for success that he expects not only his clients but his own family members to internalize and follow. Cheryl (Toni Collette) is his generally pragmatic wife whose relative sanity is the only thing that seems to be keeping the rest of the family from spinning off into unrestrained movie quirkdom. Frank's father (Alan Arkin) is a cantankerous, heroin-sniffing old man who cusses a blue streak, obsesses over pornography, and says everything that is on his mind no matter how politically incorrect in nature. Frank (Steve Carell) is Cheryl's morose gay brother who has just been released from a mental hospital for a failed suicide attempt. Dwayne (Paul Dano) is the teenaged son who wants to be an Air Force pilot and has taken a vow of silence until he reaches that goal. Finally, Olive (Abigail Breslin) is the adorable little moppet with dreams of winning the Little Miss Sunshine pageant and who seems, along with her mother, to be the one levelheaded thinker in the group.This is, for the most part, a charming, extremely well acted film that can be very entertaining provided one doesn't go into it expecting too much. The conflicts and interactions among the various characters are often sharp and shrewdly observed, and directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris keep the tone and pace of the film lighthearted and breezy (even in its darker moments). The screenplay by Michael Arndt walks a fine line between cynicism and sentiment, only occasionally stumbling along the way. Unfortunately, about halfway through the film, one of the most engaging and entertaining characters drops off the radar screen, and his absence is definitely felt. There are also a few too many sitcom level routines and situations, and the scene at the beauty pageant comes perilously close to endorsing the very thing - the sexualizing of pre-pubescent girls - that the film is supposed to be savaging (although I can see where the filmmakers could mount a counter argument to me here, but I'm not sure it would be all that convincing).Although all the performers are fine, Toni Collette is really the one who brings this film to life. In portraying the one generally ""normal"" adult on hand, Collette lets reasonableness and common sense guide her reactions to the near-surrealistic events that are happening to them. And young Abigail Breslin is a natural-born scene-stealer.Apart from its few flaws (including the fact that not a single one of the six riders in the car - not even the little girl - is ever seen wearing a seatbelt), ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a winning film that seems to be saying that, good, bad or indifferent, family is what really matters in the end.",4,"fun family comedy, but where are the seatbelts?",1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,3629,"['Death', 'drug', 'addiction', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'emotional', 'instability', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'elements', 'make', 'up', 'what', 'fast', 'turning', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'comedy', '2006', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'extended', 'family', 'six', 'piles', 'rickety', 'minivan', 'thousand', 'mile', 'road', 'trip', 'Albuquerque', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Newport', 'Beach', 'California', 'daughter', 'can', 'compete', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'pre-teen', 'girls', 'Needless', 'say', 'family', 'many', 'colorful', 'lesson-instilling', 'adventures', 'way.The', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'fall', 'category', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'independent', 'movie-making', 'will', 'instantly', 'recognize', 'photogenically', 'dysfunctional', 'say', 'own', 'individualized', 'quirk', 'stamped', 'character', 'make', 'weird', 'recognizable', 'same', 'time', 'father', 'Frank', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'win-at-all-costs', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'who', 'designed', 'nine-step', 'program', 'success', 'not', 'only', 'clients', 'own', 'family', 'members', 'internalize', 'follow', 'Cheryl', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'generally', 'pragmatic', 'wife', 'relative', 'sanity', 'only', 'thing', 'be', 'keeping', 'rest', 'family', 'spinning', 'off', 'unrestrained', 'movie', 'quirkdom', 'Frank', 'father', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'cantankerous', 'heroin-sniffing', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'blue', 'streak', 'pornography', 'everything', 'mind', 'matter', 'how', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'nature', 'Frank', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Cheryl', 'morose', 'gay', 'brother', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'mental', 'hospital', 'failed', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'Dwayne', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'teenaged', 'son', 'who', 'be', 'Air', 'Force', 'pilot', 'taken', 'vow', 'silence', 'goal', 'Finally', 'Olive', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'adorable', 'little', 'moppet', 'dreams', 'winning', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'pageant', 'who', 'mother', 'be', 'one', 'levelheaded', 'thinker', 'group.This', 'most', 'part', 'charming', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'provided', 'one', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'conflicts', 'interactions', 'various', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'sharp', 'shrewdly', 'observed', 'directors', 'Jonathan', 'Dayton', 'Valerie', 'Faris', 'keep', 'tone', 'pace', 'film', 'lighthearted', 'breezy', 'even', 'darker', 'moments', 'screenplay', 'Michael', 'Arndt', 'fine', 'line', 'cynicism', 'sentiment', 'only', 'occasionally', 'stumbling', 'way', 'Unfortunately', 'halfway', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'engaging', 'entertaining', 'characters', 'drops', 'radar', 'screen', 'absence', 'definitely', 'felt', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'sitcom', 'level', 'routines', 'situations', 'scene', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'perilously', 'close', 'endorsing', 'very', 'thing', 'sexualizing', 'pre-pubescent', 'girls', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'savaging', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'mount', 'counter', 'argument', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'convincing', 'performers', 'are', 'fine', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'really', 'one', 'who', 'film', 'life', 'portraying', 'one', 'generally', 'normal', 'adult', 'hand', 'Collette', 'reasonableness', 'common', 'sense', 'reactions', 'near-surrealistic', 'events', 'are', 'happening', 'young', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'natural-born', 'scene-stealer.Apart', 'few', 'flaws', 'including', 'fact', 'not', 'single', 'one', 'six', 'riders', 'car', 'not', 'even', 'little', 'girl', 'ever', 'seen', 'wearing', 'seatbelt', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'winning', 'film', 'be', 'saying', 'good', 'bad', 'indifferent', 'family', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'end']",N/A

In a way its refreshing to see a film like this with big name stars.  Its got a little bit of everything, and enough of it to keep most viewers happy.The movie is shot with very well with a mix of shots to capture the road film aspects of the movie and more intimate framing for dramatic moments.  In a way the movie puts you in as a observer of the actions, never letting you get too close so that the absurd moments don't move into the disturbing realm.This works great since the actors are playing this film relatively straight.  The entire case from veteran Alan Arkin to newcomer Abigail Breslin do an excellent job.  The characters are believable in their own world, and even though we laugh with them (and at them) they never feel untrue.  The cast has a great script to work with.  The mix of comedy and drama is perfect, and while tragedy occurs during the film, we are left feeling good about the outcome.The music (song and score) are perfect accompaniments and make me want to seek out the soundtrack.  Of course a certain Rick James song is going to have a whole new meaning for me.Are there any downsides to the movie?  Just a few.  Since you are watching a road movie, you kinda know what to expect.  This movie follows the same path, there is a deadline and our heroes have to navigate around a whole set of outlandish situations.  There are no ""wacky"" encounters during the film.  In fact most of the encounters are with normal people (but some of them or overly rude, or insensitive).  Our main cast are the ones who could be labeled ""wacky"".Overall a very entertaining film.  Its one I'd watch again, but not quite good enough for me to add to my collection.

I thought I might meet one of the many movie families we've seen in recent years who bounce a series of contrived eccentricities off each other. But this movie turned out to be a wonderful surprise.This was like eavesdropping on a real family, a family of real people who care about each other and who draw us into caring about them. As I was watching, I was reminded of the 1970's TV documentary featuring the Loud Family. In that pioneering reality programming, cameras were installed in a ""typical"" suburban home, and we viewers got to be flies on the wall as the Louds went through a series of anything-but-typical triumphs and tragedies. Coincidentally, the Director and Writer of  ""Little Miss Sunshine"" mentioned the Loud documentary in their DVD commentary. They said their screen drama began to remind THEM of the Loud chronicle as they tweaked the script and got it on film.Now, because of all the probing Dr. Phils and webcams everywhere, we can continuously eavesdrop on real life family drama. It's hard for any scripted drama to compete with all this reality. But I think ""Sunshine"" succeeds. It has the ring of truth; but it also has a satisfying dramatic arc. It captures what could be the plausible dynamics between family members as they, with all their diverse preoccupations, take to the road to get their little daughter to the spot she qualified for by default in a California beauty pageant.The only lapse in logic here is that none of these family members have foreknowledge of the kind of contest they are headed into. With all the notoriety surrounding the JonBenet Ramsey case, you would think everyone would be aware of what standards little girl beauty pageant contestants have to meet. But it seems all the members of this ""Miss Sunshine"" movie family are nave on that score. They don't suspect that their youngest child may not be geared to project the right sort of precocious sex appeal. And there is a disconnect between the little girl's looks and the talent presentation that her grandfather coached her into preparing.But this is a minor quibble. On the whole, I bought the premise and became engrossed. I rode along with this family in their clutch-challenged van through all their copings.

Believable to where I could take one of them home and they'd fit right in with our crazy household.The dad, has his thing - hilarious. The little girl, Olive, has her thing - endearing, sweet, funny. The brother of the mom - funny. The mom - Toni Colette, love her! The grandpa - a hoot. The big brother - WOW did they find my son and copy him? follow him around for a day and steal all his expressions, eye rolling, clothes? his anger, his emotion?

However, as a viewing of the DVD will plainly show, the satiric critique of the Little Miss Living Doll beauty pageants is relatively contained, occupying the last 20 minutes, though the point is unmistakable. The ultra polished, talented contestants against whom the film's slightly pudgy and awkward hero, Olive, competes aren't so much little girls as miniature Las Vegas show queens, coached in seductive eye use and sexy posturing. How ironic that the manager of the beauty contest is scandalized by Olive, whose ""improper"" strip tease, taught to her by her grandfather, doesn't contain a hint of seduction or sexuality.Olive's quest to be a beauty queen appears to align her with other members of her family. Her obtuse, self-programmed father, who preaches #1 or none, wants to be a published authority on positive thinking and winning. Her suicidal, sensitive, gay uncle wants to be recognized as the world's #1 Proust scholar. Her introverted, tormented and driven brother wants to be a jet pilot in his own private Nietzschean world. Toni Collette as the mom, on the other hand, is the model of tolerance and forebearance, a supportive ""gamer"" whose ability to eat ice cream without guilt fortunately has a more profound effect on her daughter than the father's insistence on winning at any cost.By the end of the film, our family of losers ultimately emerge as true winners. Alan Arkin, as the profane patriarchal grandfather, provides the film's enduring wisdom, counseling both his son and granddaughter (Abigail Breslin deserves a supporting actress award for this scene alone) before his death about the importance of simply living life to the fullest. A real winner, he tells the family, is someone ""who's not so afraid of losing he's afraid to try."" It's not the destination that matters; it's the trip. And the film literally offers one hell of a ride. Apart from some raw language, this is a family film recommended for all dysfunctional families who enjoy crying as much as laughing together.At the same time, thanks to inventive scripting and directing, this little gem transcends the ""family film"" genre, providing moments of subtlety, nuance, and genuine ""life."" The very different, often ambivalent, responses of various members of the pageant to Olive's performance suggest that not everyone buys into the Little Miss America mentality. And again the mom is the one member of the family who has sufficient confidence in her daughter to sense that the men's concern about Olive's being ""laughed at"" speaks less about Olive than their own childish fears and self-consciousness.Finally, by making Grandpa the unlikely voice of wisdom, the film takes on universal, life-affirming resonance. ""Little Miss Sunshine"" counters our tendency to see living merely as a ""means"" to some distant end or goal. Often the means needs no justification: being fully alive in the here and now can be the biggest prize of all.Count this one is an all-around winner--an entertaining, formulaic movie with enough twists, vitality, heart, and thought to almost atone for all of those long, dull ""Talledega Nights"" which moviegoers increasingly have to endure as part of their desensitizing training.",5,"It's the ride that counts, not the destination.",1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,3318,"['timing', 'film', 'theatrical', 'release', 'latest', 'bombshell', 'JonBenet', 'case', 'practically', 'uncanny', 'However', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'will', 'plainly', 'show', 'satiric', 'critique', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Living', 'Doll', 'beauty', 'pageants', 'relatively', 'contained', 'occupying', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'point', 'unmistakable', 'ultra', 'polished', 'talented', 'contestants', 'whom', 'film', 'slightly', 'pudgy', 'awkward', 'hero', 'Olive', 'competes', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'little', 'girls', 'miniature', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'show', 'queens', 'coached', 'seductive', 'eye', 'use', 'sexy', 'posturing', 'How', 'ironic', 'manager', 'beauty', 'contest', 'scandalized', 'Olive', 'improper', 'strip', 'tease', 'taught', 'grandfather', ""n't"", 'contain', 'hint', 'seduction', 'sexuality.Olive', 'quest', 'be', 'beauty', 'queen', 'align', 'other', 'members', 'family', 'obtuse', 'self-programmed', 'father', 'who', '1', 'none', 'be', 'published', 'authority', 'positive', 'thinking', 'winning', 'suicidal', 'sensitive', 'gay', 'uncle', 'be', 'recognized', 'world', '1', 'Proust', 'scholar', 'Her', 'introverted', 'tormented', 'driven', 'brother', 'be', 'jet', 'pilot', 'own', 'private', 'Nietzschean', 'world', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'mom', 'other', 'hand', 'model', 'tolerance', 'forebearance', 'supportive', 'gamer', 'ability', 'eat', 'ice', 'cream', 'guilt', 'fortunately', 'more', 'profound', 'effect', 'daughter', 'father', 'insistence', 'winning', 'cost.By', 'end', 'film', 'family', 'losers', 'ultimately', 'emerge', 'true', 'winners', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'profane', 'patriarchal', 'grandfather', 'film', 'enduring', 'wisdom', 'counseling', 'son', 'granddaughter', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'supporting', 'actress', 'award', 'scene', 'alone', 'death', 'importance', 'simply', 'living', 'life', 'fullest', 'real', 'winner', 'family', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'so', 'afraid', 'losing', 'afraid', 'try', 'not', 'destination', 'matters', 'trip', 'film', 'literally', 'one', 'hell', 'ride', 'Apart', 'raw', 'language', 'family', 'film', 'recommended', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'who', 'enjoy', 'crying', 'as', 'much', 'laughing', 'same', 'time', 'thanks', 'inventive', 'scripting', 'directing', 'little', 'gem', 'family', 'film', 'genre', 'providing', 'moments', 'subtlety', 'nuance', 'genuine', 'life', 'very', 'different', 'often', 'ambivalent', 'responses', 'various', 'members', 'pageant', 'Olive', 'performance', 'suggest', 'not', 'everyone', 'Little', 'Miss', 'America', 'mentality', 'again', 'mom', 'one', 'member', 'family', 'who', 'sufficient', 'confidence', 'daughter', 'sense', 'men', 'concern', 'Olive', 'being', 'laughed', 'less', 'Olive', 'own', 'childish', 'fears', 'self-consciousness.Finally', 'making', 'Grandpa', 'unlikely', 'voice', 'wisdom', 'film', 'universal', 'life-affirming', 'resonance', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'tendency', 'see', 'living', 'merely', 'means', 'distant', 'end', 'goal', 'means', 'justification', 'being', 'fully', 'alive', 'here', 'now', 'can', 'be', 'biggest', 'prize', 'all.Count', 'one', 'all-around', 'winner', 'entertaining', 'formulaic', 'movie', 'enough', 'twists', 'vitality', 'heart', 'thought', 'almost', 'atone', 'long', 'dull', 'Talledega', 'Nights', 'increasingly', 'have', 'endure', 'part', 'desensitizing', 'training']",N/A

Seething rage and resentment lurks virtually everywhere, but is masked in suburban conformity.  That is, almost every family member lets their resentment show in subtle ways, but is too strait-laced to truly let go.  Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette are marvelous as the unhappily wed parents, while Paul Dano dives into teen angst with relish.  Steve Carell unexpectedly dials it down ten notches as a jilted gay Proust scholar.  If you attended a dinner party with these folks, you'd be on your second bottle of pinot by the time the salad course was finished.The only two free spirits in the family are Grandpa (Alan Arkin) and Olive (Abigail Breslin).  Grandpa is freed from the strictures of conformity by his age and his drug habit.  Olive is just a wonderful young person, and fortunately the story more or less revolves around her.  Breslin is enchanting as this chubby contented soul bobbing along in this sea of misery.  Without her stellar performance, ""LMS"" would be another glum romp through unhappiness like ""The Squid and the Whale.""But fortunately, Olive lives.  The family decides to help Olive with her dream of winning the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in Redondo Beach.  So the family piles into the infamous yellow VW van and heads off.

1029629,A1WFEHAV42HTM5,B000JU9OJ4,Scrimshaw,"[0, 0]","Little Miss Sunshine is a comedy/drama road film written by Michael Arndt and directed by husband and wife team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. It follows the dysfunctional members of the Hoover family, Richard (Greg Kinnear), his wife Sheryl (Toni Collette), and their two kids Dwayne (Paul Dano), and Olive (Abigail Breslin). Along for the ride are Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carell), and Richard's father Edwin (Alan Arkin), as they travel in a yellow van to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant so the daughter Olive can compete. Each member of the family brings their own brand of humor and tragedy to the mix. This film is a prime example of how dark comedy should be done, the film has it's fair share of dark, sad, and tragic scenes, but these moments are balanced with a healthy amount of light and humor to keep the film from being too depressing. While each  member of the family have their own issues to deal with, Frank, Dwayne, and Olive are, by the end of the film, clearly the most tortured of the bunch. Frank is probably the darkest Steve Carell I've ever seen, being used to seeing him in shows like The Office and films like Date Night and The 40-Year-Old Virgin, in this film he plays a rather subdued, introverted man who is clearly disturbed and in need of help, he kind of reminds me of myself, who has a long history of psychiatric problems, minus the suicidal tendencies. Paul Dano's portrayal of Dwayne as an unhappy teenager who has taken a vow of silence until he reaches his goal of being an air force pilot, is both subdued and very emotional, particularly after he discovers he's colorblind. The youngest member of the family, Olive, brilliantly portrayed by the lovely Abigail Breslin, is clearly affected by all of the dysfunction which constantly surrounds her, as she suffers from obesity and low self-esteem, and her weird, and slightly disturbing dance towards the end also shows how messed up she really is. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, with it's hilarious comedy and oddly sympathetic characters. The few things that kept me from giving it a 5 star rating was that it was a little too vulgar at times, especially in certain scenes involving the grandfather Edwin, who is a world war 2 veteran thrown out of a retirement home for abusing heroin, and Dwayne, who, after he breaks his vow of silence, tends to swear far too much for my tastes. It almost seems as though he picked up where Edwin left off after he died. The acting was decent all around, and the film has a good balance of comedy and drama, unlike some other supposed ""dramedies"" like Everything Must Go and Margot at the Wedding, which are basically dark dramas with a few funny scenes added in to lighten the overall mood. A well-deserved 4 stars.",4,Hilarious and Heartbreaking (Spoilers),1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,2763,"['Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'comedy/drama', 'road', 'film', 'written', 'Michael', 'Arndt', 'directed', 'husband', 'wife', 'team', 'Jonathan', 'Dayton', 'Valerie', 'Faris', 'dysfunctional', 'members', 'Hoover', 'family', 'Richard', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'wife', 'Sheryl', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'two', 'kids', 'Dwayne', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Olive', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'ride', 'are', 'Sheryl', 'brother', 'Frank', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'Richard', 'father', 'Edwin', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'travel', 'yellow', 'van', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'daughter', 'Olive', 'can', 'compete', 'member', 'family', 'own', 'brand', 'humor', 'tragedy', 'mix', 'film', 'prime', 'example', 'how', 'dark', 'comedy', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'film', 'fair', 'share', 'dark', 'sad', 'tragic', 'scenes', 'moments', 'are', 'balanced', 'healthy', 'amount', 'light', 'humor', 'keep', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'depressing', 'member', 'family', 'have', 'own', 'issues', 'deal', 'Frank', 'Dwayne', 'Olive', 'are', 'end', 'film', 'clearly', 'most', 'tortured', 'bunch', 'Frank', 'probably', 'darkest', 'Steve', 'Carell', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'being', 'used', 'seeing', 'shows', 'Office', 'films', 'Date', 'Night', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'film', 'rather', 'subdued', 'introverted', 'man', 'who', 'clearly', 'disturbed', 'need', 'help', 'kind', 'reminds', 'who', 'long', 'history', 'psychiatric', 'problems', 'suicidal', 'tendencies', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'portrayal', 'Dwayne', 'unhappy', 'teenager', 'who', 'taken', 'vow', 'silence', 'goal', 'being', 'air', 'force', 'pilot', 'subdued', 'very', 'emotional', 'particularly', 'colorblind', 'youngest', 'member', 'family', 'Olive', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'lovely', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'clearly', 'affected', 'dysfunction', 'constantly', 'obesity', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'weird', 'slightly', 'disturbing', 'dance', 'end', 'also', 'how', 'messed', 'up', 'really', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'hilarious', 'comedy', 'oddly', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'few', 'things', 'kept', 'giving', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'was', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'vulgar', 'times', 'especially', 'certain', 'scenes', 'involving', 'grandfather', 'Edwin', 'who', 'world', 'war', '2', 'veteran', 'thrown', 'retirement', 'home', 'abusing', 'heroin', 'Dwayne', 'who', 'vow', 'silence', 'swear', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'tastes', 'almost', 'picked', 'up', 'where', 'Edwin', 'left', 'off', 'died', 'acting', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'good', 'balance', 'comedy', 'drama', 'other', 'supposed', 'dramedies', 'Everything', 'Must', 'Go', 'Margot', 'Wedding', 'are', 'basically', 'dark', 'dramas', 'few', 'funny', 'scenes', 'added', 'lighten', 'overall', 'mood', 'well-deserved', '4', 'stars']",N/A

This is the result of a combination of fascinating characters, great dialogues and outstanding performances by an all-star cast. On top of that, the final scene is so unexpected and hilarious that you will be rolling on the floor laughing.Olive is a seven-year-old girl whose hobby is to compete in pageants. She spends a lot of time practicing her routine and watching recordings of the Miss America pageant and mimicking the gestures of the competitors. She has one of the most dysfunctional and peculiar families you can think of. Her father, Richard, has created a nine-step program to transform people into winners. He is trying to get a publisher for the book, ""Refuse to Lose"", and the economic future of the family depends on the success of this enterprise. Her mother, Sheryl, likes to be brutally honest, feeds her family chicken out of a bucket every night and hides her smoking habit. Sheryl also has to deal with the suicide attempt by her brother, uncle Frank. Olive's grandpa also lives with the family. The old man is Olive's coach and has a drug addiction. Finally, there is the brother, Dwayne, who has promised not to talk until he is accepted into the Air Force and who idolizes the German philosopher Nietzsche.The dialogues are so good that it is unreal. For example, the honest approach of Sheryl led to a discussion during dinner in which Frank ended up explaining about his suicide attempt. But this carried further, since one of the reasons for it was being rejected by his male lover. Imagine the faces and comments of a seven-year-old when hearing about this! During this dinner, Olive finds out that the girl she lost to in the regional Little Miss Sunshine pageant has withdrawn from the finals. Now Olive has the chance to take her place and compete for the national title. The result is a road trip to California with the whole family in an old yellow van.There are a variety of complications during the trip and we get so see how the different members of the family react to stress. Once again, the conversations are what drive the interest, and grandpa (Alan Arkin) stands out with his incomparable sarcasm. Arkin's is the best performance of the bunch, but the other members of the cast do not lag far behind. Greg Kinnear and Steve Carell play their roles convincingly, and Paul Dano really shows us how a conflicted teenager behaves. Abigail Breslin deservedly got an Oscar nomination for her performance, and she joins the group of outstanding kids in movies, like Elijah Wood, Macaulay Culkin and Ivana Baquero. If you want to have a good time and laugh for a while there are few options better than this one.

In the midst of all this mess, the family has a chance to redeem itself and start acting...well, normal!I enjoyed Little Miss Sunshine. It's a comedy that doesn't present itself as satirical or a farce. It works well with the excellent cast (I expect some Oscar nods, especially for Collette, Arkin, and young Breslin), funny dialogue, and road setting.RecommendedB+",4,Pretend to be normal!,1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,1386,"['Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'sweet', 'little', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'As', 'Good', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Steve', 'Carell', '40-year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'young', 'actors', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Signs', '.The', 'movie', 'revolves', 'typical', 'American', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Richard', 'dad', 'who', 'terrible', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'always', 'family', 'members', '9', 'steps', 'success', 'even', 'failure', 'Sheryl', 'mom', 'completely', 'passive', 'Dwayne', 'son', 'family', 'not', 'speak', 'Uncle', 'Frank', 'tried', 'committ', 'suicide', 'male', 'graduate', 'student', 'Grandpa', 'heroine', 'snorter', 'Olive', 'chubby', 'daughter', 'only', 'hope', 'ordinary', 'life', 'house', 'become', 'California', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'beauty', 'pageant.After', 'being', 'informed', 'Olive', 'been', 'picked', 'contestant', 'family', 'hit', 'road', 'beauty', 'contest', 'van', 'be', 'pushed', 'get', 'going', ""n't"", 'stop', 'honking', 'midst', 'mess', 'family', 'chance', 'redeem', 'start', 'acting', 'well', 'normal', 'enjoyed', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'present', 'satirical', 'farce', 'well', 'excellent', 'cast', 'expect', 'Oscar', 'nods', 'especially', 'Collette', 'Arkin', 'young', 'Breslin', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'road', 'setting.RecommendedB+']",N/A

1029647,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B000JU9OJ4,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[3, 5]","To its credit this film features a lively group of eccentric characters, in their own defiant ways doing to the TV sort of ""family values"" what satire requires should be done to them. When the film is most honest satirically, each of these characters is revealed to be largely just his or her own carver, following dreams of bliss more often inappropriately or dully individualist than familial. On their partly forced, ""communal"" way to a beauty contest for little girls held in Redondo Beach, California, we see them mostly bickering while they're entangled in largely humorous actions, though heartbreak and loss intrude as well. This trip, I'd argue, with its ups and downs is the best part of the film - the journey itself infinitely superior to what ends it.Having created memorable eccentrics, the scriptwriters apparently didn't know in the long run what to do with them. The four alternate endings on the DVD suggest the writers' stronger talent for characterization than for an originally conceived and successful dramatic action. What they do come up with, an over the top beauty contest official and an anarchic family stunt highlighting ""togetherness,"" suggests scriptwriting desperation time. Whereas the hospital lady who earlier would have thwarted the family's plans was drawn as unfeelingly bureaucratic, rightly low key and thoroughly convincing, the beauty contest head is straight out of the world of TV sitcom and fits a different level of reality than the film posits throughout. Similarly, the final family stunt at her expense, along with the driving away through a traffic gate to her further discomfort, is now just outdated 60's stuff, a stale resolution of the sort that plays convincingly these days only on prole TV.For all its merit, this film shows us, I suspect unintentionally, that the road is far, far  better than the inn.",4,"""The Road Is Better Than The Inn""",1169337600,"01 21, 2007",2007,1860,"['credit', 'film', 'lively', 'group', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'own', 'defiant', 'ways', 'doing', 'TV', 'sort', 'family', 'values', 'what', 'satire', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'When', 'film', 'most', 'honest', 'satirically', 'characters', 'revealed', 'be', 'largely', 'just', 'own', 'carver', 'following', 'dreams', 'bliss', 'more', 'often', 'inappropriately', 'dully', 'individualist', 'familial', 'partly', 'forced', 'communal', 'way', 'beauty', 'contest', 'little', 'girls', 'held', 'Redondo', 'Beach', 'California', 'see', 'mostly', 'bickering', ""'re"", 'entangled', 'largely', 'humorous', 'actions', 'heartbreak', 'loss', 'intrude', 'well', 'trip', ""'d"", 'argue', 'ups', 'downs', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'journey', 'infinitely', 'superior', 'what', 'it.Having', 'created', 'memorable', 'eccentrics', 'scriptwriters', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'long', 'run', 'what', 'do', 'four', 'alternate', 'endings', 'DVD', 'suggest', 'writers', 'stronger', 'talent', 'characterization', 'originally', 'conceived', 'successful', 'dramatic', 'action', 'What', 'do', 'come', 'up', 'top', 'beauty', 'contest', 'official', 'anarchic', 'family', 'stunt', 'highlighting', 'togetherness', 'scriptwriting', 'desperation', 'time', 'hospital', 'lady', 'who', 'earlier', 'would', 'have', 'thwarted', 'family', 'plans', 'was', 'drawn', 'unfeelingly', 'bureaucratic', 'rightly', 'low', 'key', 'thoroughly', 'convincing', 'beauty', 'contest', 'head', 'straight', 'world', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'different', 'level', 'reality', 'film', 'posits', 'Similarly', 'final', 'family', 'stunt', 'expense', 'driving', 'away', 'traffic', 'gate', 'further', 'discomfort', 'now', 'just', 'outdated', '60', 'stuff', 'stale', 'resolution', 'sort', 'convincingly', 'days', 'only', 'prole', 'TV.For', 'merit', 'film', 'suspect', 'unintentionally', 'road', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'inn']",N/A

Abigail Breslin was also nominated and the film was included in the best picture category.I listed so many of the cast because this dark comedy is filled with good performances.Olive Hoover (Breslin) qualifies for a beauty pageant which is set to take place 700 miles away. The family includes a heroin addict grandfather (Arkin), an aspiring motivational speaker father (Kinnear), a brother who has taken a vow of silence (Dano), a suicidal uncle (Carell) and a mother who tries to hold everything together (Collette).As several of the family members can't be trusted to survive alone, the entire family decides to make the trip in their old Volkswagen van.The comedy isn't dumb, despite the highly unlikely and sometimes unbelievable situations. The story is mainly driven by dialogue with the exception of a couple of situations.The conclusion shows what happens when they finally arrive in California for the pageant.It's R-rated for language, drug references and references to sex. Perhaps the most offensive thing was seeing how little girls are presented as women in the pageant. It's just a grotesque world.It's not easy to make me laugh and I am typically wary of any movie involving Carell, but this style of humor worked for me. Nobody put in a bad performance and I did laugh out loud a couple of times. I enjoyed every minute.The presentation was excellent for such a low budget movie. Picture quality was good throughout and deserves a 4.5/5. Audio did the job and dialogue was clear (4/5).I would recommend this intelligent comedy to anyone who doesn't need to be bullied into laughter with slapstick.This is the type of story that has plenty of replay value as it will be fun to revisit these people and spend a while in their dysfunctional lives.

In that sense it is like real life.  Many families today are dysfunctional and, sadly, many end up breaking apart.  This film, contrary to some critical commentaries here, does not glorify the dysfunctional family as much as it seems to respect those that manage to stay together and support one another in spite of their idiosyncrasies, issues, self-absorbed claptrap and the like.  These characters aren't all likable, but that makes them all the more real.  That doesn't mean that their dysfunctional behaviors are being ""glorified"" as I've seen written in some reviews here.Yes, the grandfather is something of a stereotypical old pervert who loves to use the ""f"" bomb at every turn, and is an addict to boot, but no one will doubt that he loves, even adores, his granddaughter, and even though he appears to be very intolerant of his self-centered, narrow-minded, unforgiving son, he loves him anyway and even tells him how proud he is of him even when he doesn't agree with his mission in life, which fails.  He at least admires his son's guts in trying to succeed at something.  I think that is the focus here and not his flaws.Yes, the son seems to be a stereotypical self-absorbed, intolerant, cold, and counter-cultured just for the sake of being different teen-ager, but he really does love his family.  His shirt, ""Jesus was wrong"" notwithstanding, doesn't make him anything more than a confused teen-ager with a heart he tries to hide.  He even apologizes to his family at one point.  To point to this film as anti-Christian is just reading too much into it (the shirt, the conduct of the actors and so forth).  If we use this character and his famous shirt as an excuse or evidence that this film is somehow anti-Christian, then we ignore his good qualities that are far more memorable and far more important than his poor fashion counter-culture t-shirt.My only real issue with the film it that it is very unevenly paced and that often puts off an audience.  Regardless of that the acting is nothing less than terrific by all the actors involved.  Toni Collette is perfect as the caring by burned out wife to a pipe-dreaming husband, excellently portrayed by Greg Kinnear, who hopes to be the next self-help guru.  Alan Arkin is convincing as the grandfather and a very restrained Steve Carell is perfectly cast as the gay brother who attempts suicide early in the film.  Paul Dano gives a interesting performance as the son who can't stand living in the ""hell"" of his dysfunctional family.

Rather than moralizing or beating us over the head with their views of what it means to be a success, the subtle failures we all embrace every day, or the filters we use to distort our picture of the world to match our view of ourselves, they encapsulate these ideas and many more in the snappy dialogue and comical situations. You don't even realize the movie has so much meat to it because it tastes so much like ice cream.Without spoiling where the action takes you, I'll just say that the acting is strong but it's the ensemble that really works here, not one specific actor's acumen.

I will agree with people who complain that the trailers did not market the movie correctly, as it appears to be a family friendly feel good movie.  And that's not to say that it doesn't have it's heart felt moments, but there is a lot of dark and literally morbid humor to be found here.  I guess that's why I liked it so much.Little Miss Sunshine surprised me with it's ability to be simple, yet brilliant in it's simplicity.  The highest point next to the balanced script was the great ensemble work from the actors.  The characters all have interesting relationships with each other as well as a lot of backstory to add to the overall plot.  A perfectly cast movie with each actor getting a chance to shine.Most people by now at least know it's about a dysfunctional family making their way to California for the youngest memeber of the family, Olive, to compete in a beauty pageant.

But seeing the film again recently, he accomplishes a marvel portraying a gentle but not effeminate Gay man who is totally devoted to his work as an artist. Fast forward nine years to ""Little Miss Sunshine."" He is now forty six and well into middle age. The good looks are blunted but still there.

I mean honestly whoever thought this was a great idea? That was like every pedophile's Disney Land. But for selfish reasons, I'm glad it exists because otherwise there would be no movie like this that satirizes the absurdity of this whole thing with such charm and heart.I can actually sum of the movie in one sentence. Crazy family heads to the little miss sunshine pageant! In between states and cities, we get to see the craziness up close and personal. Like how Dad (Kinnear) tries to manipulate our little Olive (Breslin) into hating ice cream so that she won't get fat, or the visual gag of the malfunctioning van (hard to explain, you've got see it), or the non-talking, exercise freak older brother.Academy Award nominee Abigail Breslin was cute as a button. I was really surprised how good she was because most of the clips that I saw were the scene where she was screaming uncontrollably apparently after hearing that she won the prelimenaries. Her performance as a whole is much better than that, don't be fooled by that useless scene. Steve Carrell showed another side of his comedic range. His performance on ""The Office"" was dead on especially in terms of how he was able to find the depth in a very broad and caricaturish character. And just how he consistently developed the nitty gritty of the character. Here in this movie, he is totally believable as the suicidal and reticent brother/uncle. And then there's Alan Arkin who gave the most touching speech ever to his grandaughter about how he thinks she's beautiful inside and out.The movie appropriately hit its climax in the beauty pageant itself. It was touching when the rest of the family sort of had an ""aha"" moment about how this pageant is going to damage this little girl's self-esteem. But our little miss sunshine doesn't care, she wants to honor grandpa (who died during the road trip, BTW). Funniest line ever was when the emcee asked Olive where her grandpa is, her reply: ""He's in the trunk"" (literally)! But the absolute funniest scene was when Olive started to do the ""stripper"" routine. Apparently that's what grandpa and Olive have been practicing all along. The look on everyone's face was priceless. To offset the scandal, the rest of the family started one by one to join Olive and just lose themselves in the dance. It was sweet and moving at the same time.

It has been described as a movie about a dysfunctional family, but I disagree.  On an important level, these people are us.  Do all of us win all the time?True, in a sense, everyone in the family is a ""loser.""  They do not succeed in that quintessential  ""American"" way.  The father isn't great at his job, the mother complains because there isn't enough money, the son is colorblind, Olive isn't ""pretty"" in that beauty contest kind of way, the Uncle is gay, has lost a prestigious job, and is unhappy in love, and Grandpa snorts cocaine to numb his pain.  These do not sound like unusual problems to me, but together, they do make for a lot of really funny and poignant moments.FYI:  This is not a Hollywood Myth about the underdog winning the day.  I say ""Yay!""  Aren't you tired of those?I think the movie wants us to ask ourselves what the word ""loser"" means.  Each person in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE has failed in some important dream, but are we so enraptured with the American Myth of ""success"" that we would truly call this family dysfunctional?  The Myth tells us that ""anybody"" can do ""anything"" as long as he or she believes hard enough.  I think the movie is saying that the Myth is a dysfunctional myth. The problem with these characters in the beginning is not that they have dreams, but that they are afraid to fail.  Failure in America is a dirty word:  if you can't succeed in America, then where?At the end of the movie, although each character has failed in a significant way, each is a winner in a deeper sense.  And they certainly do not come across to me as ""losers"" or as a dysfunctional family.  I think they finally are seeing some things clearly for the first time.

Let's just say I cannot view Rick James' ""Superfreak"" the same again.  For one thing, this family is dysfunctional from the word go. Big time back seat drivers, but in spite of their own quirks and such, they do rally behind the little girl so that she could enter The Little Miss Sunshine contest and enter it she does. I am a bit surprised how they came cross country in such a broke down vehicle, but then again, I seen worse, and if your determination is more than the circumstances, that wins through. But when that little girl did her song, I fell out. First of all, you got all these prim, grown looking little girls up there looking Jon Benet Ramsey clones doing cutesy stuff; but you got this little girl  dancing to ""Superfreak"" albeit not appropriate for a little girl, not for a beauty show of Jon Benet clones, and when the folks went off, I could see the mother's concern for her child shine through for a bit, but when they joined her, I saw a family who showed love and concern for the smallest of their family.

1029671,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B000JU9OJ4,Thomas M. Sipos,"[5, 10]","This is an overall entertaining indie film, until the end.  Then it subverts it own message.  I'll explain in the SPOILER below.When the family arrives at the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant, they see that it's an exploitative affair, treating 6 and 7 year old girls like adult women.  The little girls wear makeup, adult style bikinis and evening gowns, and perform lewd song & dance routines.The family considers pulling their daughter, Olive, from the pageant.  They  consider the pageant wrong, and we are meant to concur.  But they leave the decision to Olive, who wants to go on.Turns out that Olive's song & dance is the most lewd of all, a strip-tease of sorts.  The pageant audience is shocked by Olive's lewdness, but the parents rush to defend their daughter.I don't care which ""message"" the filmmakers want to send.  Either (1) child beauty pageants are exploitative and psychologically destructive, or (2) it doesn't matter what a child does, as long as it's her choice.  But pick one message, and be consistent.The message seems to be: child beauty contests are exploitative and destructive, unless Olive enters one, because Olive is real cute, and we've grown to like her, and her dysfunctional family is loving, and besides which, she's not as skinny as the other girls, so whatever she does is fine.  The other little girls are lewd and shallow, but even if Olive behaves more lewdly than the other girls, she's not lewd at all (in her case it doesn't count).This could have been a strong indictment of child beauty pageants.  It was a fine film until the end.  I'd have given it four stars, but I'm deducting one because of its confused ending.BTW, I see this DVD has four alternate endings.  That's five endings total.

1029672,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000JU9OJ4,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[5, 7]","""Little Miss Sunshine"", the new independent comedy, is that rare thing. A comedy that works. And works consistently. It is a delightful film filled with memorable performances, in one case, the actor's best performance. I honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about this gem. You should rush out to see it.Sheryl (Toni Collette) hurries to the hospital to pick up her brother, Frank (Steve Carell). The doctor would prefer he stay there, but they don't have the insurance to pay for his recovery. Frank just lost his job, his apartment and his boyfriend, so he tried to commit suicide. As he later observes, yet another failure. Sheryl brings him to the family home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He will share a room with Dwayne (Paul Dano), Sheryl's teenaged son who is in month 9 of a self-enforced vow of silence. He later tells his uncle, through a written note, he isn't talking because he hates everyone. Uncle and nephew have to share a room together; Frank can't be left alone and there isn't room anywhere else in the crowded house. Sheryl's second husband, Richard (Greg Kinnear), a budding Dr. Phil, preaches his `revolutionary' ""9 Steps To Success"" program to half empty community college classrooms as he waits for a big book contract. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) also lives with the family, after his eviction from the retirement community, preferring to live out his last years as he wants, having sex, doing drugs and saying whatever he wants. Sheryl and Richard's little girl, Olive (Abigail Breslin) is a budding beauty queen and spends every available moment with Grandpa working on her routine for any upcoming beauty contest. One night, they receive a call. Olive will be able to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in Redondo Beach. That means one thing. The family is going on a road trip.""Little Miss Sunshine"", written by Michael Arndt (his first film) and directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (who previously worked on music videos for REM and Janet Jackson), is a delightful comedy. It creates genuine moments of laughter and also manages to tell a touching story. Every single moment seems to fit with every other moment, so if you aren't laughing during a particular scene, there is a very believable reason for this. ""Sunshine"" is all the more amazing because it is the first film from these people to hit the multiplex screens. The film is rolling out slowly and will add new screens each week. Keep an eye out for it.""Sunshine"" caused a bit of a stir at the last Sundance Film Festival. After screenings, Fox eventually paid $10.5 million for the distribution rights, a lot of money to pay for a film at Sundance, but they clearly saw something special in it.The key to this film is that it was initially made outside of the studio system. The directors, writers and actors were free to create a film as they saw fit, how they felt it worked. I guarantee you the creative process was a lot more streamlined because they had fewer people to add their two cents and `suggest' changes and fiddle with the end product. The writer and directors have created a lively, interesting, funny film about a family falling apart at the seams. The opportunity for Olive to participate in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant serves as an opportunity to bring them together, but there is too much bad history in their lives. The road trip brings them together, to a certain degree, but also serves to naturally expose their problems to an even greater degree. In a studio film, we would most likely see the family members make some sort of phony resolution. In ""Sunshine"", the story progresses naturally to its surprising conclusion. Yes, I know it seems odd to say natural and surprising in the same sentence, but it works in this film. Once we see what is happening in the resolution, everything just fits. Its hilarious, but human and we can honestly say the family does the right thing.The majority of ""Sunshine"" takes place during the family's road trip from New Mexico to Redondo Beach, California in an old yellow VW bus. As they travel along the highway, watching every penny, much of the humor derives from their close, confined proximity. The film also manages to revisit comedy bits, using the same joke, but making it slightly different each time. This makes us all the more receptive to the laughter because we are able to anticipate when a laugh might be coming, yet the filmmakers change it and make it unexpected, making it even more funny.The cast is universally excellent. Toni Collette is very good as Sheryl, the mother of the family. She is the least funny of the group, but her role is invaluable, she is the glue holding the group together. She makes sure everyone is moving together, trying to keep everyone on the same page, yet she is a modern day mom and is pulled in many directions at once. Rushing from her job to the hospital, she walks in to see her brother still wearing her work uniform. She didn't have time to change or even think about it. On the way home, she picks up dinner, a bucket of fried chicken and all of the sides. As the family sits down to dinner, she plops a salad on the table and starts to open a bottle of soda pop, asking if everyone wants some. Throughout, she provides support and encouragement, but isn't beyond having an argument or a disagreement with her family.Greg Kinnear is also very good as Richard, the budding self-help guru. This is easily Kinnear's best performance to date. Richard is always living his self-help program and finds it difficult to turn the switch on or off when he is dealing with his family. In one hilarious scene, he starts to impose his self-help teachings on young Olive, as the family sits at a diner, enjoying breakfast. Despite the warnings from everyone at the table, he continues to persist, slipping little comments in. As we learn more about his character, we begin to see little cracks in his armor; he seems awfully desperate for that book deal to happen, he seems like he will crack at any moment due to problems with the car. It is a funny, funny performance showing a man at the edge of his rope.Steve Carell is, as always, very funny. Frank is a man with little to hope for, so he is very low key. Yet, he isn't beyond telling anyone and everyone that he is the Number One Proust Scholar in the Country, despite he no longer holds a position as a professor. Even without the job, I guess the title still holds. It is also amusing to find that his rival, the Number Two Proust Scholar in the Country is the catalyst of Frank's current problems. Through much of the film, Frank stares at his family like they are aliens from another planet. How did he get himself into this situation? Then there are moments when he simply can't take it anymore and responds in a sarcastic fashion to a family member's ramblings.Paul Dano is very good as Dwayne, the sullen teenager who hates everyone in his family. His role is very difficult because he doesn't speak for a long period, everything he experiences has to register in his facial expressions and body language. Naturally, as a teenager, he doesn't emote a lot, but when he does, we feel it. He seems real, interesting, unusual and believable.Alan Arkin is easily the star of the group. As Grandpa, he has a lot of habits that he doesn't feel the necessity to cover up. He talks openly and frankly about sex, imploring Dwayne to have sex with as many women as possible, he's young, and he should be having a lot of sex, experiment. He also has less acceptable habits involving drugs, but he doesn't really care to hide those very much either. Because he is so frank and open, he almost becomes a sort of Greek chorus, providing a reality check for all of the madness his family creates.Abigail Breslin is a real find as Olive, the little girl who has a dream of becoming a beauty queen. She is simply perfect as a child who is sheltered, yet inquisitive. When her Uncle Frank arrives, she asks about his situation and after a little bit of a disagreement, he tells her. Yet, because she doesn't fully understand, it doesn't really bother her.When the family finally arrives at the pageant, Olive is nervous because she is about to fulfill a lifelong dream. Yet, she is also entirely uninhibited and doesn't realize how different she is from the freakish Jon Benet Ramsey look-a-likes she is competing against. Olive is an endearing character and Breslin does a great job.Do I really need to say more? Hasn't this love letter already convinced you?Go already.

1029673,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B000JU9OJ4,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[4, 10]","Having finally rented this DVD after all the praise and an Oscar, I was expecting a good dose of hilarity. What I got was a dark rewrite ofNational Lampoon's Vacationbrought up to theseNapoleon Dynamitetimes. It's dark, cynical and relentlessly bleak, even if moments of really funny stuff bounce off the bleakness.The actors are all well suited for their roles, with Abigail Breslen perfect as Olive and Alan Arkin getting the snarkiest lines as the heroin snorting granddad. Steve Carell proved he had dramatic chops here, even he is forced to play the gay clich&eacute; to the max, and Paul Dano gets a heck of a lot of mileage out of not speaking for most of the film.However, the film never really nails its timing.

1029674,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000JU9OJ4,Timothy Kearney,"[2, 3]","LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE should not be a funny movie. Think about the characters in the film. We have a mother who's trying to keep a dysfunctional family together. Her husband is a self help guru who can't get his book published. The oldest son is an odd lad who has taken a vow of silence he will not break until he gets into the Air Force Academy and it's clear from the beginning--he hasn't a shot of getting into the academy. The young daughter wants to enter a the ""Little Miss Sunshine"" pageant, a contest she has as much of a chance at winning as her brother does of getting into the Air Force Academy and she spends far too much time alone with her grandfather who has no boundaries and say the most inappropriate comments to anyone who will listen and even worse comments for those who do not. Add to the mix a gay brother who is a frustrated Proustain scholar who has just attempted suicide but can't afford a hospital stay so he goers to live with his sister and her family. There's nothing funny about this family, yet as they all are crowded into a Volkswagen bus for a road trip to the Little Miss Sunshine contest, we find ourselves laughing out loud, often hysterically at this sometimes dark, sometimes slapstick, but always clever comedy.The film works because of its ensemble cast that works together to bring out the humorous nuances of the troy. Toni Collette is convincing as Sheryl the working mother trying to keep her family together and throughout the film, she's the only sane personality. Greg Kinnear is Sheryl's husband and is a convincing hapless self help guru we want to shake into reality but also someone we feel for as well. Alan Arkin is the offensive yet lovable grandfather from hell. My guess is no one had a grandpa quite like him. Steve Carell's at times dry and deadpan manner suites the lovelorn suicidal Frank perfectly. Paul Dano is believable as Dwayne and Abigail Breslin plays the young Olive rather sweetly and truly is a ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (you'll have to watch to see if she actually wins the crown--this reviewer will not divulge the plot).When I saw this film at the theater, I thought it would be a one time only kind of film. Seeing it more than once would never repeat seeing it the first time. I was wrong. It's one of those comedies that can generate laughs over and over.

1029679,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000JU9OJ4,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","A dysfunctional family takes to the road for their daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin), who has a shot at the finals of a beauty pageant for little girls in California. Greg Kinnear is Richard a success obsessed father who developed a mental training method to succeed, and Alan Arkin is a powder-sniffing Grandpa. Everyone in this family has some problem; Toni Collette as Sheryl, Richard's wife, Steve Carell as suicidal Frank and Paul Dano as Dwayne who vowed never to speak. The film has already been praised by the critics and general audiences, but it is also true that the film is not to everyone's taste.Many people say ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is a funny comedy. I don't disagree with their opinions, but I find the film totally different way because the film contains a considerable amount of sadness or poignancy in it behind the apparently hilarious part of the film. I am not sure this sadness creeping into the film's world is really the original intention of the directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, or the writer Michael Arndt, but I can say if you're looking for a kind of story in which underdogs become what you call ""winners,"" maybe this is not your film.For all the absurd scenes in their cross-continental journey or the farces at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, the characters take themselves very seriously, and are determined to be true to themselves. And their adamant decision might sometimes irritate you. The characters are not begging to be liked, but still you will notice the changes of heart in every one of them by the end of the story. So ""heart-warming"" would be a misleading tag to this film for the people in it are often annoying like someone in your own family.The actors are all great. Many have already praised Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear and of course Abigail Breslin the centerpiece of the film, so I won't add any more words. The filmmakers are clearly helped greatly by their talent - Paul Dano's son part needs more improvement and some minor characters like police officer or hospital doctors are not as great as others -- but the entire cast of the main characters still did a fine job.`Little Miss Sunshine' is not free from clich&eacute; and unnecessary quirkiness. The satires could have been more biting with more skillful or daring treatment of the pageant scenes, where little girl Olive does one thing. It is not my cup of tea, but the film is certainly a good character study, not afraid of showing unlikable part of them.

They added a lot to the script visually; but many of their decisions were based on time and budget constraints, which caused them to pare down some of the more important scenes of the film, making it less impacting. Like the beauty pageant: in the script, it was much bigger, more outlandish and more climactic. Or Frank and Dwayne's trip to the beach: the script had them taking surfboards far out from shore, causing one to wonder what they really had in mind (another suicide attempt?) and coming back wearing ""Loser"" T-shirts. The directors pared that down to a trip to the end of a pier. Many of the comic effects (like double-takes and revealing glances) were ignored, and many of the funnier lines were spoken so nonchalantly and sotto voce that they were virtually thrown away.The best character in the story was the yellow VW bus. After that, Abigail Breslin as Olive and Greg Kinnear as Richard were good; Toni Collette as Sheryl and Alan Arkin as Grandpa were okay; Paul Dano and Steve Carell were disappointingly miscast and could have passed as corpses through most of the film. None of these were Oscar-winning performances, nor should this have been a Best Picture nominee. The directors took this script and tried to make it a cross between the outlandishly funny, off-the-wall comedy RAISING ARIZONA, and the more serious black comedy AMERICAN BEAUTY - and it didn't work. What they ended up with was a quirky and weird little film that is fairly entertaining but not particularly funny. I think Hollywood is so enthralled with their own quirkiness and weirdness that they interpret anything quirky and weird as being funny and great entertainment. Now, I like quirky, but I draw the line at weird.What could have been a good story about false values - dividing the world between winners and losers, with child beauty pageants as the example of that idea taken to extremes - ended up getting lost in all the quirkiness and weirdness, time constraints and budget limitations. You know something is wrong when the directors don't know how to end the film. They have four different endings on the DVD, none of them what scriptwriter Michael Arndt had in mind, and none of them good. Some are downright lame. The fact that this film won at Sundance does not make it a great film.

[Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl.]  You've heard music that's so cacophonous that it actually becomes quite listenable in spite of itself.  [Webern springs to mind.]  You've seen video sights so austere that they seem somehow friendly.  [A howling blizzard in Antarctica perhaps, viewed from the warm safety of your living room.]In the same fashion, there are movies so bad that they become not only Good, but even Great.  This movie is almost one of those.  Almost.First there's the humor.  Early on, it's so strained-at that when you finally get to things that really are funny, such as the Alan Arkin character's diatribe about 'Lots of 'em,' you have forgotten how to laugh.Some reviewers have remarked on how well dysfuntionality is captured here.  Yes, the teenager's angst is well portrayed, but all of the other bickering, shouting, intervening, and sulking seems contrived.The satire on tiny tot beauty pageants is so over the top that you want to crawl under your chair and hide, especially from the smarmy M.C., who must be every little kid's worst nightmare.  The point is made in the first five seconds.  After that it's just painful.On the other hand-- and it's a big one-- Miss Breslin is fantastic.  She rescues the movie from going down the tubes.  She's not all that functional herself, but in comparison with the rest of her assorted relatives, she's eminently sane.  And, yes, as other reviewers have said, her act in the talent competition is wonderful, amazing, and memorable-- getting the movie's point across very nicely.  And in the nick of time, too.But the highlight of the movie comes a little earlier, in a scene between the Breslin character and the Arkin one-- that is, between granddaughter and grandfather.  He tells her she's the most beautiful girl in the world, and she shyly demurs.  But he insists, and then comes up with a great line to the effect that ""And I'm saying that, not because of the brilliance of your mind, or your precocious intellect, or because of your accomplishments, but because you're goddamned gorgeous.""  The fact that she is anything BUT gorgeous gives the scene a powerful poignancy that makes up for many shortcomings earlier and later in the plot.

The problem is, I don't know that that's true. From the first trailer, I felt that this film was branding itself as such, before anything like that had happened. If this film had come out a few years ago, before we had Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State, and even Wes Anderson films like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, it might be more groundbreaking. Also, is a film really independent when it stars Alan Alda, Greg Kinnear, and Steve Carrell (the fastest rising name in comedy besides Sacha Baron Cohen)?The truth is, this film is an interesting, sometimes funny, almost poignant look at a dysfunctional family. However, most of the circumstances that take place in the film are at best slightly unbelievable, at worst entirely silly. Often a huge argument will erupt, only to be settled seconds later. The entire premise of the film is a bit of a stretch.On the other hand, all of the acting is superb. Steve Carrell is surprisingly successful as a depressed Proust scholar... I could go on about the rest of the cast, but they all nail their characters. The standout is little Abigail Breslin as young Olive, who has a Dakota Fanning-esque acting talent which really makes the film.Overall, this is an enjoyable film, but really that's all it is. It doesn't live up to its great hype, and it never transcends its ""I'm a quirky independent film, love me"" style.
