1534796,ACXICDHILUDFE,B007N0SV9W,Cosmo,"[3, 3]","This production of the Nutcracker from Amsterdam ballet company features Matthew Golding (Prince), one of the best dancers in the world. This fact alone makes it a not to be missed event. James Stout (Nutcracker) proved to be a young dancer who raised by eyebrows on several occasions. The production itself is quite spectacular, with lots of theatrical effects and surprises. Personally, I did not quite get reworking of the second act divertissement, which is very elaborate but a bit too mental. Overall, very strong and interesting production - must see, especially since it is on Blu-ray. Get a cheap Blu-ray player, if you still don't have one.",5,Matthew Golding!,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,650,"['production', 'Nutcracker', 'Amsterdam', 'ballet', 'company', 'Matthew', 'Golding', 'Prince', 'one', 'best', 'dancers', 'world', 'fact', 'alone', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'event', 'James', 'Stout', 'Nutcracker', 'proved', 'be', 'young', 'dancer', 'who', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'several', 'occasions', 'production', 'quite', 'spectacular', 'lots', 'theatrical', 'effects', 'surprises', 'Personally', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'get', 'reworking', 'second', 'act', 'divertissement', 'very', 'elaborate', 'bit', 'too', 'mental', 'Overall', 'very', 'strong', 'interesting', 'production', 'must', 'see', 'especially', 'Blu-ray', 'Get', 'cheap', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'one']",N/A
1534797,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B007N0SV9W,I. Giles,"[19, 19]","This version of the Nutcracker Ballet by Wayne Eagling and Toer van Schayk was created as long ago as 1996 and has been a popular and regular part of the Dutch Ballet repertoire ever since. It differs from the Petipa based versions in several ways as described in some detail below and which may or may not be a problem for non-Dutch purchasers.The setting is placed in Amsterdam in 1810 rather than a small German town. The time of the action is on the eve of St. Nicholas rather than Christmas Eve. This is because there was no tradition of giving Christmas presents in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 19th century. Neither of these changes seems to me to require very much adjustment on the part of the viewer - just a little flexibility, even though the use of ice skates for some of the initial dancing outside Clara's house may come as more of a surprise! It reminded me of my eldest daughter's experience of living in Holland several years ago where temporary outdoors skating rinks were a regular feature of Dutch winter life.More importantly there are major changes to the 2nd act where, instead of being set in the Kingdom of Sweets, Clara dreams that she has been transported to a land through a magical lantern where people from Clara's life and the 1st act party reappear. These also arrive through the magic lantern lens which forms a central part of the backdrop scenery. The travellers include the Mouse King whose curse, when killed by the Nutcracker doll, is cancelled thus enabling the Nutcracker doll to return to its former role as a Prince. The result of these changes is a much closer story link between the two acts but at the expense of the more familiar character dances. Instead, the same musical sequence is used for alternative character dances with quite different choreography and which I personally enjoyed very much. The concept of these significant changes is significant and will be a major factor for future purchasers to consider.The scenery settings are sumptuous apart from the correctly conceived and somewhat austere setting of Clara's own home which is contrasted with the party setting of act 1 and the magical setting of act 2. To my eyes it all seems totally acceptable for Amsterdam in 1810 and also visually attractive. The same can be said of the costumes throughout. The dancing as performed by Anna Tsygankova as Clara, Matthew Golding as the Prince and James Stout as the Nutcracker is expertly done and the choreography is both interesting and delightful in my opinion. The corps de ballet are of the same high standard as are all the other highlighted members of the cast such as the Mouse King, his entourage and the various party guests and family members.The music is well played by the orchestra under the baton of Ermanno Florio and this is well presented in clear, full sound in both DTS-HD 5.1 and stereo. The imaging is crisp and precise without any evidence of movement blur. The camera work provides a satisfying balance of close detail and more panoramic views.There is a 27 minute bonus feature which focuses on interviews with the choreographers, the dancers and provides plenty of backstage footage. This is an interesting bonus and is well done as an illuminating addition to the performance of this production.I and my wife enjoyed this production very much indeed. We both found it to be a refreshing experience to be enjoyed as an equally satisfying alternative to the more traditional Petipa-based versions or the Peter Wright Royal Ballet version for example. Much will depend on individual purchaser's responses to the overall concepts of the Dutch setting and the use of a magic lantern as a sort of time machine to link the two acts together into more of a continuous story line and as described above.Provided that this necessary flexibility to the production can be achieved I would suggest that this is a very worthwhile and enjoyable 5 star experience and would expect it to give much pleasure to many future purchasers.............................................Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:Just an EXCELLENT Review!I've had this on my Wish List for a while, but with Christmas approaching it's time to put in my Order!I'll add some comments as appropriate once I've had a look at it...Best Wishes, and keep up The Good Work!

There was no party, or giant tree.  The Nutcracker became a prince for about 5 mins. before he somehow turns back into a Nutcracker only to be turned back into a prince again in the second act.  The rats keep making appearances to torment the main characters throughout the ballet.  Second act takes place inside a ""magic camera"".  Half of this production is unrecognizable; were it not for the music, you wouldn't know that this was the Nutcracker.

Apparently those that rated it two stars didn't notice the different title and have little or no tolerance for the unfamiliar.I have six versions of the traditional Nutcracker, all with their slight variations.  It was refreshing to see it with non-Petipa choreography.The adult Clara is danced by Anna Tsygankova, who also danced the title character in the Dutch National Ballet's Giselle.  She was very good in Giselle, but her dancing in this production was much more impressive.

While my passion for ballet has never dimmed, long, long ago had my desire to see yet another Nutcracker ~  I do not know what possessed me to purchase this video; perhaps the previous excellent review or the notion of a dutch update.  Am I ever glad that I did.  This production is simply breathtakingly beautiful, charming and sincere.  No changes that make any true alteration to the story, but changes that actually make one think a little deeper ... the Land of Sweets may appeal to children, but honestly that syrupy sweetness stood in the way of many a good Nutcracker production.  I can't speak enough of the beauty of the set design and direction, both in their simplicity and ability to evoke a familiarity that draws one in ... genius work!  The early frozen canal and skating interlude / entrance stands out as a highlight as does it's simple begining set in a bathroom (!? - it was touchingly sweet) - everything just works.  The dancing is superb, all leads even down to the mouse king exceptional - the conducting masterful, delicate and sincere - I'm not sure I've ever heard it's score played better - I think it also a compliment to it's unique staging and direction that lends one to better 'hear' the story.  The High-Def filming and sound are superbly mastered, making it's viewing even more the treat. As someone who in most every aspect possible is a traditionalist, I can't recommend this production  more heartedly.  Before last night I mostly likely would have told you I'd never sit down and watch the Nutcracker again ... Now I can tell you, this will be coming out every year at Christmastime (or St. Nicholas Eve) to set the mood for the season.  I adored it.
