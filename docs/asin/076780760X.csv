At the time, it was unusual to see her in a comedy after viewing her in tough crime or sex-type movies for awhile. (I didn't see this film until 10 years after it had been released.) She's a decent comedienne, like her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin) has turned out to be, too.The comedy is more chuckles than guffaws. For parents wondering about the film: there is the usual too-liberal ""values"" espoused here, such as sex on the first date is ""cool,"" and a few other things involving a cute teen daughter.

The movies are ""The Blues Brothers"", ""Trading Places"", ""Spies Like Us"" and of course, this film.""My stepmother is an alien' is the tale of an astrophysicist(Aykroyd) who mistakenly penetrates an alien world when he sends a signal from his lab one stormy night. Soon, a beautiful denizen of that planet (Kim Basinger) arrives on earth in order to convince the scientist to send the signal again so that her world might be saved. The scientist..who is a lonely widower with a teenage daughter- falls in love with the sexy ET and marries her- thus the title.This is a fun movie, filled with top notch performances by its cast (Jon lovitz has an extremely funny early supporting role as Aykroyd's brother, and future Buffy alumnus Alyson Hannigan plays Aykroyd's daughter), and a genuinely amiable wit.The key to the film is that director Richard Benjamin understands that he has DAN AYKROYD as his star, and he plays on that. Aykroyd demonstrates such energy in this film that his performance probably WAS picked up by an alien radio in a another galaxy. His character is immediately likeable, and he plays off of Basinger very well.As the title creature, Basigner is actually quite funny and charming, and the result is a fun little picture that may not set any new standards, but nonetheless delivers the goods with a solid one-two comedic punch.

Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it.
