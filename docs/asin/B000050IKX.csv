562879,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B000050IKX,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[1, 1]","Go along with John Hammond and explore the myth surrounding legendary Blues musician Robert Johnson. Check out Hammond's bio on wikipedia. Interesting background there. Anyway, it is an interesting trip to the countryside of Mississippi and Arkansas and back in time as Hammond actually goes to the very locations Robert Johnson lived and played. You meet a former girlfriend and some of Johnson's possible descendants. The mysterious and infamous death of Johnson is examined as is the comical (to my mind) much rumored ""deal with the devil"" at the crossroads. Hammond is a cool guy to tag along with and is clearly in love with the music and history he explores. I recommend this unique exploration of an original American icon.",4,American history,1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,730,"['Go', 'along', 'John', 'Hammond', 'explore', 'myth', 'surrounding', 'legendary', 'Blues', 'musician', 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'Check', 'out', 'Hammond', 'bio', 'wikipedia', 'Interesting', 'there', 'Anyway', 'interesting', 'trip', 'countryside', 'Mississippi', 'Arkansas', 'back', 'time', 'Hammond', 'actually', 'very', 'locations', 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'lived', 'played', 'meet', 'former', 'girlfriend', 'Johnson', 'possible', 'descendants', 'mysterious', 'infamous', 'death', 'Johnson', 'examined', 'comical', 'mind', 'much', 'rumored', 'deal', 'devil', 'crossroads', 'Hammond', 'cool', 'guy', 'tag', 'clearly', 'love', 'music', 'history', 'recommend', 'unique', 'exploration', 'original', 'American', 'icon']",N/A

""brnn64""","[14, 16]","This is good in that not only does this explore the histroy of the great bluesman Robert Johnson, it also gives you an understanding of the Black Delta culture that he came from and we  see some of Johnson's surviving friends and lovers talk about him. A very touching scene shows the actual &quot;Willie Mae&quot; mentioned in &quot;Love In Vain&quot; smiling sweetly as she hears RJ mentioning her name in the song. However, while Hammond is a good narrator, being a serious student of the blues, we could do without his forced and strained renditions of RJ's songs and let the actual recordings speak for themselves. Other than that, blues fans will enjoy this.",4,Good inside look at RJ,1004400000,"10 30, 2001",2001,664,"['good', 'not', 'only', 'explore', 'histroy', 'great', 'bluesman', 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'also', 'understanding', 'Black', 'Delta', 'culture', 'came', 'see', 'Johnson', 'surviving', 'friends', 'lovers', 'talk', 'very', 'touching', 'scene', 'actual', 'quot', 'Willie', 'Mae', 'quot', 'mentioned', 'quot', 'Love', 'Vain', 'quot', 'smiling', 'sweetly', 'RJ', 'mentioning', 'name', 'song', 'However', 'Hammond', 'good', 'narrator', 'being', 'serious', 'student', 'blues', 'could', 'do', 'forced', 'strained', 'renditions', 'RJ', 'songs', 'let', 'actual', 'recordings', 'speak', 'Other', 'blues', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A

Obviously, I was wondering if there was going to be much duplication of material between that and the ""Search For"" DVD when I finally decided to buy the latter. I wasn't disappointed. While ""Can't You Hear..."" is in itself a fine piece of work, this DVD touches on some details of Robert Johnson's life not covered in ""Can't You Hear..."". John Hammond's interviews with Mack McCormick and the apparent son of Robert Johnson are particularly fascinating highlights of this film. As a result, I recommend all R.J. fans owning both DVD's--they complement each other well. As for John Hammond's intermittent performances of Johnson's songs, I thoroughly enjoyed them. The only corny part of the movie is when Hammond and Johnny Shines pretend to ""cut heads"" on the street--not too authentic, obviously, but I guess they were just trying to illustrate the concept.
