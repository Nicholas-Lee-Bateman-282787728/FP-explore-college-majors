The Perfect Weapon introduced us to the expert in Kenpo, and gave us a great movie too.  Street Knight, unfortunately is not as good of a movie, and Speakman's action scenes are very short and minimal.Street Knight tries to become an above average B-action movie, and does so in terms of quailty, acting, and represented action.  The story however never is very interesting, revolving around the big gangs of L.A., while another group of guys intervene the gang's peace while trying to attempt a jewely heist.  Speakman's charcater, Jeff Barrett, helps a youg woman he knows by trying to locate her missing brother, who has been entangled in the gang situation.  Action is rarely used until the last 15 minutes of the film, where Speakman is featured in only 2 decent fights, but both are over before you can really start to get into them.If you are hoping for anything compared to The Perfect Weapon, you will be dissapointed.  If you are expecting the worst movie ever, fortunately its not that either.  An average film overall, that could have been better with more action and a little more exciting story.",3,expected more action out of speakman,1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,1254,"['Street', 'Knight', 'fine', 'movie', 'Speakman', 'Jeff', 'Wincot', 'are', 'arguably', 'best', 'actors/martial', 'artists', 'American', 'martial', 'art', 'movies', 'Perfect', 'Weapon', 'introduced', 'expert', 'Kenpo', 'gave', 'great', 'movie', 'too', 'Street', 'Knight', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'movie', 'Speakman', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'short', 'minimal.Street', 'Knight', 'tries', 'become', 'above', 'average', 'B-action', 'movie', 'so', 'terms', 'quailty', 'acting', 'represented', 'action', 'story', 'however', 'never', 'very', 'interesting', 'revolving', 'big', 'gangs', 'L.A.', 'group', 'guys', 'intervene', 'gang', 'peace', 'trying', 'attempt', 'jewely', 'heist', 'Speakman', 'charcater', 'Jeff', 'Barrett', 'youg', 'woman', 'trying', 'locate', 'missing', 'brother', 'who', 'been', 'entangled', 'gang', 'situation', 'Action', 'rarely', 'used', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'where', 'Speakman', 'featured', 'only', '2', 'decent', 'fights', 'are', 'can', 'really', 'start', 'get', 'them.If', 'are', 'hoping', 'anything', 'compared', 'Perfect', 'Weapon', 'will', 'be', 'dissapointed', 'are', 'expecting', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'fortunately', 'not', 'either', 'average', 'film', 'overall', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'action', 'little', 'more', 'exciting', 'story']",Street Knight VHS

Paul ""John doe""","[1, 1]",I'm going to review Street Knight I liked this movie Mark DiSalle was involved with the movie but the directing was handled by by Albert Magnoli it he directed Purple Rain don't know how that gets you to direct a action crime thriller but he does a good job. It stars Jeff Speakman as Jake Barrett Christopher Neame as James Franklin Jenifer Gatti as Rebecca Bernie Casey as Raymond & Richard Coca as Carlos. Plot is Jake Barrett is an ex cop who is now a mechanic & this boy goes missing a lady named Rebecca seeks his help out to find her younger brother Jake doesn't want to cause 3 years ago during a bank robbery a little girl was killed when he was trying to talk this guy out of it that's why he quit being a cop. Los Angels is in the middle of gang warfare & the rival gangs are under this truce & this other group led by a crime boss named James Franklin has members of a gang I think called The Lords killed to make it look like this broke the truce this boy driving the car Carlos he escapes since he's a witness Franklin wants him killed. Eventually Jake agrees to help Rebecca. Franklin finds out about it & tries to have Jake killed. He owns 2 of Franklin's goons & has his friend Raymond who works in  forensics for the police. Jake's phone has been tapped by & when Rsymond has all the info on he calls Jake Franklin's group shows up where Rsymond & Jake are going to meet & Raymond is gunned down. Jake finds Carlos & gets him to safety Franklin kidnaps Rebecca which leads to the final confertation at the Train Depot. I hope my explanation of the plot was good. Jeff Speakman he did a good job Jenifer Gatti was fine. Christopher Neame did fine as the villain he didn't ham it up like the villains in Edge Of Darkness did.Yeah this was better than Edge Of Darkness. Richard Coca was ok. Bernie Casey was fine for time he was given I think he should've lived though. This movie is what Walker Texas Ranger Trial By Fire should've been. This was the last film released by Cannon films which they did good with making small budget movies look big budget. If this wasn't released theatrically that was a shame cause I look at movies like Predators that don't deliver the goods & wonder how a train wreck like Predators gets a theatrical release & wonder why Street Knight doesn't have a DVD release I'm sure Predators will get a whole bunch of goodies on the DVD & Blu Ray. It would nice where people could discover these fun solid entertaining action films.

334178,A25RN8X70DSZLU,6302787076,JRP,"[0, 0]",This review is from my review that I did back in 2010 fir Street Knight so here we go 20 years Ago Street Knight. Directed by Albert Magnoli he directed Purple Rain don't know how that gets you to direct a action crime thriller but he does a good job. Pluse he directed Tango & Cash. It stars Jeff Speakman as Jake Barrett Christopher Neame as James Franklin Jenifer Gatti as Rebecca Bernie Casey as Raymond & Richard Coca as Carlos. Plot is Jake Barrett is an ex cop who is now a mechanic & this boy goes missing a lady named Rebecca seeks his help out to find her younger brother Jake doesn't want to cause 3 years ago during a bank robbery a little girl was killed when he was trying to talk this guy out of it that's why he quit being a cop. Los Angels is in the middle of gang warfare & the rival gangs are under this truce & this other group led by a crime boss named James Franklin has members of a gang I think called The Lords killed to make it look like this broke the truce this boy driving the car Carlos he escapes since he's a witness Franklin wants him killed. This group lead by James Franklin uses advanced tatics like make up look like someone else. . Eventually Jake agrees to help Rebecca. Franklin finds out about it & tries to have Jake killed. He owns 2 of Franklin's goons & has his friend Raymond who works in forensics for the police. Jake's phone has been tapped by & when Raymond has all the info on he calls Jake Franklin's group shows up where Raymond & Jake are going to meet & Raymond is gunned down. Meanwhile Franklin has 1 of his men kill The Leader Of The Blades & make it look like Barrett did it. The Blades attempt to do a drive by Barrett finds out that he has been set up. Jake finds Carlos & gets him to safety they escape on horse back when some of Franklin's men are chasing them it's a cool scene. Then he drops Carlos off at a friends house where he sneaks out to tells the 2 gangs what's really going on. Franklin kidnaps Rebecca which leads to the final meanwhie Franklin's group is using the undergroud tunnels in the city to sneak in & rob these businesses. Barrett sneaks into Franbklin's hideout where he has a fight with 1 of Franklin's right hand men. It is a good fight scene plus Jeff Speakman beats this guy up with wrenches confertation at the Train Depot Barrett rescues Rebecca & He beats up James Franklin stabs him in the chest & then guns him down. The 2 gangs decide to make peace with each other. Jake is told that he has to go to The Station & fill out a statement along with a form for reinstatement on the force he says he will think about it.  I hope my explanation of the plot was good. The score composed by David Michael Frank was very good. Albert Mangolia did a pretty good job  Jeff Speakman he did a very good job. Christopher Neame did a pretty good job.  Jenifer Gatti was fine. Richard Coca was good. Bernie Casey was fine for time he was given I think he should've lived though.This was the last film released by Cannon films which they did good with making small budget movies look big  & wonder why Street Knight doesn't have a DVD release.

334181,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,6302787076,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","""Street Knight"" is generally regarded as the film that ended Jeff Speakman's career, or at least his aspirations of becoming a big name in Hollywood. WithThe Perfect Weaponbeing as perfect of an action movie as it was, Speakman was all set to become the film world's next Van Damme when this one came around, failed to capture peoples' interests, and simultaneously ended the life of Cannon Films and condemned Speakman to acting in strict DTV fare. However, while ""Street Knight"" isn't a great action movie, I hardly consider it bad enough to kill a career. Fans of the man ought to take notice, at least, for this is one of the few decent ones that Speakman turned out subsequent to his initial masterpiece.The story: Jake Barrett (Speakman), an ex-cop who left the force after failing to save a child during a hostage crisis, investigates a missing persons report at the request of a friend and consequently finds himself entrenched in a deadly gang war perpetrated by an evil mastermind (Christopher Neame,Hellbound) looking to wipe out his competition.While this may have been the last movie that Cannon produced, it remains fully imbued with the cheesy charm that fans will be familiar with. The film absolutely howls B-movie for its indulgence in comfortably overdone themes and clich&eacute;s: trash-talking ethnic gangbangers and over-the-top villains (""I can't wait to see this city in ashes""), an out-of-nowhere love scene followed by a shooting in a strip joint, on-location shooting in the ghetto-y parts of Los Angeles, and the added bonus of a chase scene on horseback. It's all very glorious stuff if you live for camp and is supported by a pretty neat cast: Jennifer Gatti (Watching You) as Jake's love interest, Richard Coca (Only the Strong) as her brother caught in the middle, and Lewis Van Bergen (Rage of Honor) as the turncoat police captain. Ketty Lester (Little House on the Prairie) plays Jake's kindly old neighbor and Bernie Casey (Never Say Never Again) makes an appearance as his professor-friend. Yup, everything here's set for a hammy good time.Alas, a movie that's been built on camp can only truly satisfy if it has offers up decent action content, and this is where ""Street Knight"" fails. Actually, the action is very decent - there's just so little of it! It's incredibly disappointing that after the abundant, creative fight scenes of Speakman's initial vehicle, three out of the four hand-to-hand encounters in here do not exceed ten seconds in length. Speakman's still got the moves - proven when he battles powerlifting champion Tom Magee (Dragonfight) by replacing his trusty rattan sticks with a pair of wrenches - but when he only gets to use 'em so infrequently, their impact is nullified. With only the single stalk & shoot scene at the end of the movie to add to the mix, the film ends up feeling very toothless and ultimately unworthy of a man as physically talented as Jeff.In short, you know from the start that the movie's going to take you right back to the good old days of '80s exploitation, but it becomes clear after a while that it's only going to get good to a certain degree and no better. The deficit of solid action scenes hurts the film more than anything else: if the fights were longer or more abundant, I easily could have given ""Street Knight"" an extra star, but sans them, we're left to realize that, on their own, Cannon trademarks are only satisfying up to a point. Still, there's enough of Jeff in here to buy (and enjoy) the movie just for his sake, so again, fans ought to take notice.",3,"""That was for Jesus.

In someways I am getting ahead of the story, because STREET KNIGHT was a theatrical release, although one that grossed less $1 million. It's star was Jeff Speakman, a kenpo expert who had a small role in the Van Damme flick LIONHEART, followed by the lead in one of the greatest American chopsocky movies ever, THE PERFECT WEAPON. For some reason, ausiences never embraced him, maybe it was because he was to blue collar, not a superman, not exceptionaly muscular, not a GQ cover model. Still Speakman was one of the best, and along with Perfect Weapon, these are his defining movies.Still unavailable on DVD, Speakman stars as Barret, an ex-cop with emotional problems after a hostage situation turned bad and a child was killed. Now, as the villian put it, he's a neighborhood do-gooder trying to make petance. Speaking of villians, Christopher Neame (also in Chuck Norris' good god awful HELLBOUND the same year) is a delicously slimy one. His goal is to turn two street gangs, one Latino, one African-American, who have called a truce, into waring factions. Barret, dosen't want that and he will get to the bottom of Neame's evil sceame, but a few heads, limbs, etc. must be broken first.The martial arts, as common in this era, are superb. The action rarely slows down, just enough to tell a good solid story, through most of the characters are flat and sterotypes. Cool cheesy 90's music to score the violence, a few dumb one liners, and brisk ninety minute pace. I miss the good old days. Bring on the DVD already.",4,Jeff Speakman's other essential movie,1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,2056,"['1990', 'was', 'when', 'lucky', 'folks', 'got', 'huge', 'non-stop', 'glut', 'martial', 'arts', 'cinema', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'period', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'knock', 'offs', 'was', 'admitidley', 'superior', 'HK', 'films', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Jet', 'Li', 'infiltrated', 'states', 'was', 'teenage', 'boy', 'time', 'never', 'missed', 'single', 'chopsocky', 'flick', 'course', 'loved', 'big', 'guns', 'Seagal', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Lundgren', 'Norris', 'there', 'was', 'always', 'little', 'way', 'B-flick', 'coming', 'video', 'stores', 'new', 'star', 'look', 'foreward', 'someways', 'am', 'getting', 'ahead', 'story', 'STREET', 'KNIGHT', 'was', 'theatrical', 'release', 'one', 'grossed', 'less', '1', 'million', 'star', 'was', 'Jeff', 'Speakman', 'kenpo', 'expert', 'who', 'had', 'small', 'role', 'Van', 'Damme', 'flick', 'LIONHEART', 'followed', 'lead', 'one', 'greatest', 'American', 'chopsocky', 'movies', 'ever', 'THE', 'PERFECT', 'WEAPON', 'reason', 'ausiences', 'never', 'embraced', 'maybe', 'was', 'was', 'blue', 'collar', 'not', 'superman', 'not', 'exceptionaly', 'muscular', 'not', 'GQ', 'cover', 'model', 'Still', 'Speakman', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'Perfect', 'Weapon', 'are', 'defining', 'movies.Still', 'unavailable', 'DVD', 'Speakman', 'Barret', 'ex-cop', 'emotional', 'problems', 'hostage', 'situation', 'turned', 'bad', 'child', 'was', 'killed', 'Now', 'villian', 'put', 'neighborhood', 'do-gooder', 'trying', 'make', 'petance', 'Speaking', 'villians', 'Christopher', 'Neame', 'also', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'good', 'god', 'awful', 'HELLBOUND', 'same', 'year', 'delicously', 'slimy', 'one', 'goal', 'turn', 'two', 'street', 'gangs', 'one', 'Latino', 'one', 'African-American', 'who', 'have', 'called', 'truce', 'waring', 'factions', 'Barret', 'dose', ""n't"", 'want', 'will', 'get', 'bottom', 'Neame', 'evil', 'sceame', 'few', 'heads', 'limbs', 'etc', 'must', 'be', 'broken', 'first.The', 'martial', 'arts', 'common', 'era', 'are', 'superb', 'action', 'rarely', 'down', 'just', 'enough', 'tell', 'good', 'solid', 'story', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'flat', 'sterotypes', 'Cool', 'cheesy', '90', 'music', 'score', 'violence', 'few', 'dumb', 'one', 'liners', 'brisk', 'ninety', 'minute', 'pace', 'miss', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'Bring', 'DVD', 'already']",Street Knight VHS
