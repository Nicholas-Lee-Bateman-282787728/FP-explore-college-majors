I described as a ""cheap imitation of Riverdance.""Since Lughnassadh was last week and I took Lugh(aka Lord Of The Dance)as my Patron Deity,I decided to give LOTD another try.  I rented it from the library and have just finished watching it.  Here's my analysis:1.  It's MORE overtly Pagan than RD2.  It has a storyline that is easier to follow3.  The Triple Goddess is quite easy to recognize, The Maiden, being represented by the Young Girl who plays the Irish Whistle SO ENCHANTINGLY, The Mother, being represented by the female lead,  The Crone, being represented by the Womon who dresses in green and has glorious red hair and sings sweetly and mournfully to us4.  Michael Flately makes a PERFECT Lugh, flamboyant, as a God of Fire/Sun(another one of His names is The Shining One)should be.  Protector of the weak, when he defends The Maid Of The Woodlands.  It doesn't get any better than that5.  The dancing is INCREDIBLE6.  The stage set is great7.  The lighting isn't QUITE as good as RiverdanceBUT...And it's a big but!  IT'S STILL NOT AS WONDERFUL AS RIVERDANCE.  And the reason why it's not as wonderful it the SOUL-HAUNTINGLY LOVELY MUSIC OF RD.  Now if Michael Flately could manage to get Bill Whelan to compose the music...it stands a good chance of perhaps being even better than Riverdance.But I believe that BOTH tapes belong in people's collections.

Kuczma ""RogueUlfric""","[95, 103]","When the name Michael Flatley is mentioned, many people immediately call to mind the heart-pounding rhythms and intoxicating melodies of Riverdance.  That's all fine and dandy, but resist the temptation to consider Lord of  the Dance an extension of its popular predecessor.  This show concentrates  exclusively on Irish dance, incorporating many of the darker aspects of the  Celtic heritage into its story and imagery.A consummate showman, Flatley  dominates the stage in a fiery, breathless performance of boundless energy.  There is a raw edge to this music and dance portrayal of the battle  between good and evil.  Lord of the Dance runs the full gauntlet of  emotions; occasionally tender, often sensual, frequently aggressive to the  point of near violence.For one who takes the time (and the required  concentration) to carefully observe, Flatley's technical brilliance is  apparent in the speed, difficulty and perfection of form which he brings to  his dance routines.  Amazingly, the supporting dancers are almost equally  as skilled.However, the enjoyment of this show is not in its technical  merit, but in its artistic wizardry.  It is an intricate performance which  frequently intertwines the movements of many dancers, yet maintains its  cohesion and flow, never losing the simple beauty of skilled bodies in  constant motion.The single flaw is in the editing of the video, which  occasionally cuts between camera angles so quickly and so often as to be  distracting.  Within this minor problem, however, are some visual gems,  such as seeing the feet of the dancers from BENEATH the stage, a unique  perspective that gives a true appreciation for the power and skill of the  cast.Lord of the Dance is not, as occasionally suggested, a repackaging  of Riverdance.  It is a completely different visual experience, one that  stands rightly and proudly on its own.

Just as Curry's ice dancing morphed into ice ballet in his genius hands, the ordinarily subdued Celtic dance has morphed into Irish Precision dancing under Flatley's creative genius. With lovely costuming, creative but understated arm movements and a jazzy touch of show biz, not a bad thing in every case, this is a treat for the eyes, ears and soul. Purists may prefer the less flashy, more reserved performances, and there is something to be said for that. But if you enjoy heart-racing passionate soaring dance and can appreciate the monumental precision training and athletic excellence involved in putting together just one dance, let alone several, you will truly enjoy this creative display of a brand new art form. With the exception of the oddball Druidic walk-ons by candle-bearing attendants, it was a cohesively dazzling performance. Say what you will about Michael Flatley's towering ego, he is nonetheless a creative genius. I could have done with fewer dizzying camera-shifts, no doubt a by-product of overzealous camera men who seem to have the notion that viewers have short attention spans.
