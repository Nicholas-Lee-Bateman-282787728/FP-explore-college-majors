Tenchi learns that he is the rightful emperor of Jurai as the fight with Kagato draws near. There is also some heartbreaking drama involving Ryoko and Ayeka. Tenchi takes on Kagato to prove the innocence and claim the title of emperor. This DVD is an amazing climax. When I saw the final episode for the first time I shed a tear or 2. I was an overly emotional 16 year old at the time, but it still tugs at my heart strings a little 13 years later.

573509,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B000059LGP,Michael Valdivielso,"[0, 0]","Tenchi and the gang find out the true nature of the evil they face, as Kagato comes for them!  This is not the Kagato from the OVA series, but a Prince of Jurai who has turned to the dark side of the Jurai power.  He was defeated by Yosho and his name erased from history.  Now he returns.  He battles and wounds both Yosho AND Ryoko, kidnaps the Ayeka and escapes, deciding to fight Tenchi at a place and time of his choosing.  He tells Tenchi that he will be waiting for the boy at the Jurai Palace and disappears.As you can guess there is a good reason why there are four episodes on this DVD.  The ending is complex and very detailed, as the gang battles to get through the layers of defenses around Jurai.  One by one they show their skill and talent as they help Tenchi get closer to the palace.  But one by one they also drop out, either wounded or powerless to go on. Even Nagi and a wounded Ryoko do their best to deliver Tenchi to the palace before they withdraw.Within the palace the Knights confront two Dark Knights who serve Kagato, which allows Tenchi to slip past and carry out the final showdown with the evil Kagato.  At this point think Samurai epic.The very last episode is a ending without a ending as many of the characters slowly return back to Earth to be with Tenchi and the last scenes are almost the same scenes we saw at the start of the first episode!Because this TV series, &quot;Tenchi Universe&quot;, is so much longer than the OVA, it allows for a lot more character development, more themes and a exciting main plot.  True, being made for TV meant it couldn't be as mature, but I felt it was worth the money.  Now, of course, the DVDs have been collected into sets, many of which you can get used, so make sure to shop around before you give away your hard earned cash!",5,The ending of the Tenchi Universe.,1087603200,"06 19, 2004",2004,1803,"['Tenchi', 'gang', 'find', 'out', 'true', 'nature', 'evil', 'face', 'Kagato', 'not', 'Kagato', 'OVA', 'series', 'Prince', 'Jurai', 'who', 'turned', 'dark', 'side', 'Jurai', 'power', 'was', 'defeated', 'Yosho', 'name', 'erased', 'history', 'Now', 'Yosho', 'AND', 'Ryoko', 'Ayeka', 'escapes', 'deciding', 'fight', 'Tenchi', 'place', 'time', 'choosing', 'will', 'be', 'waiting', 'boy', 'Jurai', 'Palace', 'disappears.As', 'can', 'guess', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'are', 'four', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'ending', 'complex', 'very', 'detailed', 'gang', 'get', 'layers', 'defenses', 'Jurai', 'One', 'one', 'show', 'skill', 'talent', 'help', 'Tenchi', 'get', 'closer', 'palace', 'one', 'one', 'also', 'drop', 'out', 'either', 'wounded', 'powerless', 'go', 'Even', 'Nagi', 'wounded', 'Ryoko', 'do', 'best', 'deliver', 'Tenchi', 'palace', 'withdraw.Within', 'palace', 'Knights', 'confront', 'two', 'Dark', 'Knights', 'who', 'serve', 'Kagato', 'Tenchi', 'slip', 'past', 'out', 'final', 'showdown', 'evil', 'Kagato', 'point', 'think', 'Samurai', 'epic.The', 'very', 'last', 'episode', 'ending', 'ending', 'many', 'characters', 'slowly', 'return', 'back', 'Earth', 'be', 'Tenchi', 'last', 'scenes', 'are', 'almost', 'same', 'saw', 'start', 'first', 'episode', 'TV', 'series', 'quot', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'quot', 'so', 'much', 'longer', 'OVA', 'lot', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'more', 'themes', 'exciting', 'main', 'plot', 'True', 'being', 'made', 'TV', 'meant', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'mature', 'felt', 'was', 'worth', 'money', 'Now', 'course', 'DVDs', 'have', 'been', 'collected', 'sets', 'many', 'can', 'get', 'used', 'so', 'make', 'sure', 'shop', 'around', 'give', 'away', 'hard', 'earned', 'cash']",Tenchi Universe - Volume 8 - The Last Battle

I picked up the DVD as soon as I could, and was extremely anxious to watch it. Universe is my favorite Tenchi series, and the final episodes are absolutely beautifully done. There is far more time for character development to happen in Universe, which is really shown off by the four final episodes.In episode 23, &quot;No Need For Karma&quot;, Aeka pours out her heart to Tenchi, and we finally get introduced to Universe's version of everyone's favorite villain, Kagato, and his history with Yosho.In episode 24, &quot;No Need For Ryoko&quot;, Kagato kidnaps Aeka and forces Tenchi and friends to finally go to Jurai to save Aeka. They're in a tough bind when Nagi, the all purpose filler character/Deus ex Machina shows up and saves the day, and actually serves a purpose to the outcome of the story. While in episode 23, Aeka made her feelings clear to Tenchi, in 24 it's Ryoko's turn as she begs Tenchi once more not to go through with saving Aeka. While we always knew Ryoko cared for Tenchi, this episode finally shows it. There are some absolutely beutiful scenes in this episode, and one which actually brought a tear to my eye.In episode 25, &quot;No Need For a Showdown&quot;, Aeka shows off her true power and love for Tenchi, while he and Kagato fight it out in a final showdown between good and evil...In episode 26, &quot;No Need For a Conclusion&quot;, The fight is over, and Tenchi recollects the events that led to his return to Earth. Tenchi then starts recalling the beginning of his adventures in the same way that episode 1 starts, finally explaining the &quot;never-ending festival&quot;. Loose-ends are tied up with a surprise ending that you can't help but love. This is why I love this show!Now that I've raved enough about the actual episodes, I'll talk a bit about the DVD itself. The video and sound quality is excellent at most times, but some scenes seem to look better than others. One of the only complaints I would have about this DVD is that there are virtually no extras. Sure, there are a few sketches, and two-- count them, two-- character profiles, but that's it. This was quite disappointing. Another minor complaint is that they changed the final episode's ending animation. In the original VHS release, they had the full version of &quot;Up-Walk in Galaxy&quot; (With both Ai Orikasa and Yumi Takada singing) played on top of most important scenes from the beginning of the series to the end. This is a very minor complaint, but it was sure nicer than the normal ending theme.",5,An amazing end to a great &quot;Tenchi&quot; series now on DVD!,986601600,"04 7, 2001",2001,2619,"['final', 'volume', 'Tenchi', 'Universe', 'finally', 'out', 'DVD', 'was', 'just', 'what', 'was', 'waiting', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'as', 'soon', 'could', 'was', 'extremely', 'anxious', 'watch', 'Universe', 'favorite', 'Tenchi', 'series', 'final', 'episodes', 'are', 'absolutely', 'beautifully', 'done', 'far', 'more', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'happen', 'Universe', 'really', 'shown', 'off', 'four', 'final', 'episodes.In', 'episode', '23', 'quot', 'No', 'Need', 'Karma', 'quot', 'Aeka', 'out', 'heart', 'Tenchi', 'finally', 'get', 'introduced', 'Universe', 'version', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'villain', 'Kagato', 'history', 'Yosho.In', 'episode', '24', 'quot', 'No', 'Need', 'Ryoko', 'quot', 'Kagato', 'Aeka', 'forces', 'Tenchi', 'friends', 'finally', 'go', 'Jurai', 'save', 'Aeka', ""'re"", 'tough', 'bind', 'when', 'Nagi', 'purpose', 'filler', 'character/Deus', 'ex', 'Machina', 'up', 'day', 'actually', 'purpose', 'outcome', 'story', 'episode', '23', 'Aeka', 'made', 'feelings', 'clear', 'Tenchi', '24', 'Ryoko', 'turn', 'Tenchi', 'once', 'more', 'not', 'go', 'saving', 'Aeka', 'always', 'knew', 'Ryoko', 'cared', 'Tenchi', 'episode', 'finally', 'are', 'absolutely', 'beutiful', 'scenes', 'episode', 'one', 'actually', 'brought', 'tear', 'eye.In', 'episode', '25', 'quot', 'No', 'Need', 'Showdown', 'quot', 'Aeka', 'true', 'power', 'love', 'Tenchi', 'Kagato', 'fight', 'out', 'final', 'showdown', 'good', 'evil', 'episode', '26', 'quot', 'No', 'Need', 'Conclusion', 'quot', 'fight', 'Tenchi', 'events', 'led', 'return', 'Earth', 'Tenchi', 'then', 'recalling', 'beginning', 'adventures', 'same', 'way', '1', 'starts', 'finally', 'explaining', 'quot', 'never-ending', 'festival', 'quot', 'Loose-ends', 'are', 'tied', 'up', 'surprise', 'ending', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'why', 'love', 'show', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'raved', 'enough', 'actual', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'talk', 'bit', 'DVD', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'most', 'times', 'scenes', 'seem', 'look', 'better', 'others', 'One', 'only', 'complaints', 'would', 'have', 'DVD', 'are', 'virtually', 'extras', 'Sure', 'are', 'few', 'sketches', 'two', 'count', 'two', 'character', 'profiles', 'was', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'minor', 'complaint', 'changed', 'final', 'episode', 'ending', 'animation', 'original', 'VHS', 'release', 'had', 'full', 'version', 'quot', 'Up-Walk', 'Galaxy', 'quot', 'Ai', 'Orikasa', 'Yumi', 'Takada', 'singing', 'played', 'top', 'most', 'important', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'series', 'end', 'very', 'minor', 'complaint', 'was', 'sure', 'nicer', 'normal', 'ending', 'theme']",Tenchi Universe - Volume 8 - The Last Battle
