The problem here is that the type of humor just doesn't appeal to me.  I can sit here and say the Man Who Knew Too Little is awful but the reality is that it just doesn't fit my tastes.  It's about Bill's character going to England to meet up with his brother.  He's surrounded by extravagant people -or so he believes- that are all actors and actresses.The entire film is based around one specific type of comedy- that being, Bill finding himself in situations where he believes the people are acting, so he joins in and improvises his own lines however.... these people are actually serious- Bill's the only one who doesn't realize this.  So for example, in one segment when a gun is pulled on Bill while he's roaming the streets, he quickly comes up with a few convincing lines believing it's part of a rehearsal or play, not even realizing that his life is actually in danger.  To add more to the misery, the guy pulling the gun hesitates because he's confused.  The robber *should* have shot Bill to make it crystal clear this is a real robbery.  This is the type of humor the movie is going for.  If you like this scene you'll probably like the rest of the movie.  If you don't, *turn it off now*.  This situation should be funny given Bill's track record as a hilarious comedian in films such as Groudhog Day and What About Bob"", but it ends up creating no reaction out of me whatsoever (perhaps because what's considered humorous here reaches a level of neverending ridiculousness that's too absurd to even bother with).  Once you see the first 20 minutes, you know what to expect because the type of humor never changes.  Again, matter of taste.For some -or rather, for most- this sounds like a wonderful idea on paper until you watch it and realize the film is going for a James Bond-type of storytelling.  Since I hate James Bond films with a passion and will never make the mistake of watching another one again, it doesn't work for me.  Even if this is supposed to be a satire of Bond movies, it doesn't change the fact that only Bond fans can understand the events taking place.  I have no problem placing this movie in the same category and that you have to have some kind of understanding or knowledge of Bond films in order to appreciate the humor.  I don't.  Even worse are the British people who are hard to understand as well.  Not just their accent, but actions and demeanors.  Hey I love the British- I talk to them online all the time and love the conversations, but their take on comedy never really made any sense to me.  I guess the one thing I can't fault is the writing.  It does create an elaborate well-told storyline that's easier to understand if you're into this sort of thing, even though I personally despise it and can't sit through it without cringing.Overall, have an understanding of James Bond films and the British and a movie like this will probably make total sense then.  The way I see it, Bill Murray really dropped the ball by participating in this movie when his talents run far deeper than this.",1,I was that man- the one who knew too little when I thought this would actually be good,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",2012,3180,"['Oh', 'dear', 'love', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'pieces', 'not', 'mistake', 'time', 'time', 'same', 'thing', ""'re"", 'guilty', 'fact', 'problem', 'here', 'type', 'humor', 'just', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'can', 'sit', 'here', 'say', 'Man', 'Who', 'Knew', 'Too', 'Little', 'awful', 'reality', 'just', ""n't"", 'fit', 'tastes', 'Bill', 'character', 'going', 'England', 'meet', 'up', 'brother', 'surrounded', 'extravagant', 'people', '-or', 'so', 'believes-', 'are', 'actors', 'actresses.The', 'entire', 'film', 'based', 'one', 'specific', 'type', 'comedy-', 'being', 'Bill', 'finding', 'situations', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'acting', 'improvises', 'own', 'lines', 'however', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'serious-', 'Bill', 'only', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'realize', 'So', 'example', 'one', 'segment', 'when', 'gun', 'pulled', 'Bill', 'roaming', 'streets', 'quickly', 'up', 'few', 'convincing', 'lines', 'believing', 'part', 'rehearsal', 'play', 'not', 'even', 'realizing', 'life', 'actually', 'danger', 'add', 'more', 'misery', 'guy', 'pulling', 'gun', 'confused', 'robber', '*should*', 'have', 'shot', 'Bill', 'make', 'crystal', 'clear', 'real', 'robbery', 'type', 'humor', 'movie', 'going', 'like', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'rest', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", '*turn', 'off', 'now*', 'situation', 'should', 'be', 'funny', 'given', 'Bill', 'track', 'record', 'hilarious', 'comedian', 'films', 'such', 'Groudhog', 'Day', 'What', 'Bob', 'up', 'creating', 'reaction', 'perhaps', 'what', 'considered', 'humorous', 'here', 'level', 'neverending', 'ridiculousness', 'too', 'absurd', 'even', 'bother', 'Once', 'see', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'type', 'humor', 'never', 'changes', 'Again', 'matter', 'taste.For', '-or', 'rather', 'most-', 'wonderful', 'idea', 'paper', 'watch', 'realize', 'film', 'going', 'James', 'Bond-type', 'storytelling', 'hate', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'passion', 'will', 'never', 'make', 'mistake', 'watching', 'one', 'again', ""n't"", 'work', 'Even', 'supposed', 'be', 'satire', 'Bond', 'movies', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'only', 'Bond', 'fans', 'can', 'understand', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'have', 'problem', 'placing', 'movie', 'same', 'category', 'have', 'have', 'kind', 'understanding', 'knowledge', 'Bond', 'films', 'order', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'Even', 'worse', 'are', 'British', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'hard', 'understand', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'just', 'accent', 'actions', 'demeanors', 'Hey', 'love', 'British-', 'talk', 'online', 'time', 'love', 'conversations', 'take', 'comedy', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'sense', 'guess', 'one', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'writing', 'create', 'elaborate', 'well-told', 'storyline', 'easier', 'understand', ""'re"", 'sort', 'thing', 'even', 'personally', 'despise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'cringing.Overall', 'have', 'understanding', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'British', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'total', 'sense', 'then', 'way', 'see', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'really', 'dropped', 'ball', 'participating', 'movie', 'when', 'talents', 'run', 'far', 'deeper']",N/A

I'm not a Bill Murray die hard fan...in fact it's 2005 and I just saw this movie for the first time. It was so funny that I ended up watching most of it a second time with some of my kids.  I think the plot is interesting because it mixes two opposite situations...one is an entertainment theatre for regular people...and the other is an international peace/sabotage deal with England and Russia.  The actress who plays with Bill Murray is beautiful...does a great job and enhances his part well.  Bill Murray does a great job also...but I think the movie itself is interesting as a concept even without Murray.For kids, there is a recurring section in the movie that has hints of S/M, and I didn't like having my seven year old see that scene and the comments that went with it...nor the little comment that had a hint of homosexual preference in it during the middle of the movie...nor the use of God's name in vain....for those who are sensitive to those things...and there are many out there...know that those things are in this movie...but it's not heavy...only a few passing references.I think Bill Murray is the same guy who did Ground Hog day...and this movie is probably about as good as that one in my view.

Just like ""Groundhog Day"" I hated this film when I first saw it and just like ""Groundhog Day"" I found myself liking this a lot more after each repeated viewing.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that this is my favourite Bill Murray film.  In an obvious reference to/spoof of Peter Seller's work on the entire Pink Panther franchise from the intro Mancini-esque opening sequence music ala ""The Return of the Pink Panther"" to the bumbling detective/spy protagonist this film has actually remained a whole lot funnier than that film that upon recent viewing has truly aged very, very poorly.  There are also links to ""A Fish Called Wanda"" as well with the scene where the male ""actor"" abusive to his ""girlfriend"" is also called Otto and also the female lead Whalley just like in that film first tries to outwit the protagonist before eventually falling for him; again, this film has aged much better than that other English/American collaboration too.Overall, this is a very good action comedy and falls into that rare category of comedy where even the jokes age very well and also one that I can actually see myself enjoying over the years through repeated viewing.  The only knock on this dvd version though is the lack of any meaningful special features as both the picture and sound quality in Dolby 5.1 Surround is very good.  I still don't know why this is so for me but thankfully I decided to give this film another chance and although I hated it the first couple of viewings, I now find myself enjoying this more each time I watch it.

C Clark ""eanna""","[2, 3]","Like John Candy, Bill Murray has single-handedly carried a number of weak movies up the hill to decency, if not all the way to excellence. I expected little from this, a thin plot on which to hang a number of fish-out-of-water/guy-who-doesn't-know-what-danger-he-is-in gags and jokes based on all the films it (lightly) satirizes. Yet I found myself thoroughly enjoying it, until the wooden ending that stretches the silliness just a little too far. It seems as if the moviemakers insisted that this thing last 90 minutes, so the Russian dancing scene wore out its welcome, and then the dopey ending left a bad taste. But before that, Murray's charming and deft acting makes a film that would stink with another actor (Chevy Chase, anyone?) an actual delight.No need to hash out the plot...there ain't one. And the other actors are mostly a group of vaguely familiar folks acting as the one-dimensional characters they are. Though at least the female lead is attractive without being sleazy. But when Bill is chatting with the cops, or mugging for the thugs, or good-naturedly encouraging or apologizing, I found myself genuinely amused. I don't think you need to be a hard-core fan of his to enjoy this. I certainly would not put myself in that category. (Hey, I sat through Lost in Translation and Broken Flowers...both of which I found darn near unwatchable, so I do not accept anything he does.)One more thing. Hollywood, which claims to love the little man, cannot make a movie about normal people. Films are about famous chefs, not their underlings, magazine editors, never underpaid graphic designers, business honchos, not database administrators, or wild and exotic people who drive MGs, not guys with kids who drive Chevies.

This time, he's Wallace Ritchie, a guy from Iowa, who decides to take a trip to London to surprise his brother, James (Peter Gallagher). James, however, is preparing for an important dinner meeting, so he buys Wallace a ticket for the Theatre of Life, an experimental theatrical experience, in which people pay to be a part of the play.Wallace is instructed to wait by a certain phone booth until he gets the call that tells him where to go next. But he answers the wrong call -- one that was meant for a real, live hitman. He unknowingly becomes caught up in a secret operation that's supposed to begin a second Cold War -- and he thinks he's just an actor.This movie is filled with hilarious action -- like a car chase involving the police and Wallace driving a Mini the wrong way around a roundabout. Bill Murray does an excellent job of acting clueless (like I said, it's what he does best). Peter Gallagher's performance, on the other hand, makes me nervous.

Talk about a story that could have been based upon true life incidents is not what this film is about. This is comedy at its best. Bill Murray's character is a man  who manages a Blockbuster-video store someplace in Iowa. Murray decides to  take a vacation and visit his brother in London. His brother (Peter  Gallagher) is entertaining some important clients that same evening and  sends his brother (Murray) out to participate in this audience-interaction  play involving spies called the `Theater of Life'. Well, as the play  begins, Murray accidentally stumbles into a real-life spy drama and takes  everything that happens next as if he is just acting in a play. The result  is non-stop humor which leaves the audience busting up outloud.

103538,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,079073477X,RMurray847,"[3, 4]","Bill Murray has long been a favorite film performer of mine.  From his sharply-timed, sarcastic and hilarious turns in GHOSTBUSTERS and STRIPES, for example (or his more dim-witted schlubiness in CADDYSHACK) to his subtle work in LOST IN TRANSLATION or THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS, Murray has always managed to do an amazing amount with such little apparent effort.But his best work relates directly to the quality of the script.  This may seem like an obvious statement, but when I think of a comic like Jim Carrey, for example, his skills sometimes transcend terribly written stuff (I can still laugh like crazy at certain moments in ACE VENTURA...but boy, what a badly directed and plotted film!).  Murray, though, needs to connect with quality material.  Whether an unlikely romantic lead in GROUNDHOG DAY or a sad, world-weary documentarian in THE LIFE AQUATIC, Murray needs a script and he's off to the races.Thus I present THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE...one of the poorest scripts Murray deigned to work on.  The idea is actually amusing...dim-witted American Wally comes to America and inadvertently becomes involved in international espionage as a world-class spy.  Wally thinks he's spending a diverting evening in a ""total immersion performance piece""...a play in which he is a star, and those around him are improvising actors.  Naturally, we see that everything is very real...but Wally NEVER does.Sadly, the script and execution are frankly on a TV movie level.  Many of the scenes have horrid pacing or the completely wrong tone.  Murray tries gamely to elevate scenes that have little humor in them...but he comes across as desperate.  And the best scene of all, the climactic Russian dance scene (I will spoil no more), which starts out quite hilarious...just goes on and on and on until it becomes annoying.  Most other scenes seem to involve Wally accidentally thwarting the efforts of world-renowned assassins to kill him...but the bad guys are very one-dimensional and leave no lasting impression.Peter Gallagher plays Murray's stuffy brother, and his is a thankless role.  It is a part that is not remotely funny and never could be...yet Gallagher hams it up as though overacting will make his scenes suddenly funny.Joanna Whalley (once Whalley-Kilmer) was fun to see again, if only to remember what a hot commodity she was, however briefly.  She brings a similar zing to the proceedings that Elizabeth Hurley brought to AUSTIN POWERS...but the zing becomes familiar and boring after awhile.I found myself smiling or chuckling fairly frequently throughout...and the film is quite good-natured overall.  But it is as though a recipe with wonderful ingredients has been undercooked (or perhaps half-baked)...the ingredients are still wonderful, but the dish as a whole is tough to get through.",3,Poor script sinks Bill Murray's efforts,1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,2806,"['Bill', 'Murray', 'long', 'been', 'favorite', 'film', 'performer', 'mine', 'sharply-timed', 'sarcastic', 'hilarious', 'turns', 'GHOSTBUSTERS', 'STRIPES', 'example', 'more', 'dim-witted', 'schlubiness', 'CADDYSHACK', 'subtle', 'work', 'LOST', 'IN', 'TRANSLATION', 'THE', 'ROYAL', 'TENNENBAUMS', 'Murray', 'always', 'managed', 'do', 'amazing', 'amount', 'such', 'little', 'apparent', 'effort.But', 'best', 'work', 'directly', 'quality', 'script', 'may', 'seem', 'obvious', 'statement', 'when', 'think', 'comic', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'example', 'skills', 'sometimes', 'transcend', 'terribly', 'written', 'stuff', 'can', 'still', 'laugh', 'crazy', 'certain', 'moments', 'ACE', 'VENTURA', 'boy', 'what', 'badly', 'directed', 'plotted', 'film', 'Murray', 'though', 'connect', 'quality', 'material', 'unlikely', 'romantic', 'lead', 'GROUNDHOG', 'DAY', 'sad', 'world-weary', 'documentarian', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'AQUATIC', 'Murray', 'script', 'races.Thus', 'present', 'MAN', 'WHO', 'KNEW', 'TOO', 'LITTLE', 'one', 'poorest', 'scripts', 'Murray', 'deigned', 'work', 'idea', 'actually', 'amusing', 'dim-witted', 'American', 'Wally', 'America', 'inadvertently', 'involved', 'international', 'espionage', 'world-class', 'spy', 'Wally', 'spending', 'diverting', 'evening', 'total', 'immersion', 'performance', 'piece', 'play', 'star', 'are', 'improvising', 'actors', 'Naturally', 'see', 'everything', 'very', 'real', 'Wally', 'NEVER', 'does.Sadly', 'script', 'execution', 'are', 'frankly', 'TV', 'movie', 'level', 'Many', 'scenes', 'have', 'horrid', 'pacing', 'completely', 'wrong', 'tone', 'Murray', 'gamely', 'elevate', 'scenes', 'have', 'little', 'humor', 'desperate', 'best', 'scene', 'climactic', 'Russian', 'dance', 'scene', 'will', 'spoil', 'more', 'out', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'just', 'annoying', 'Most', 'other', 'scenes', 'seem', 'involve', 'Wally', 'accidentally', 'thwarting', 'efforts', 'world-renowned', 'assassins', 'kill', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression.Peter', 'Gallagher', 'Murray', 'stuffy', 'brother', 'thankless', 'role', 'part', 'not', 'remotely', 'funny', 'never', 'could', 'be', 'yet', 'Gallagher', 'hams', 'up', 'overacting', 'will', 'make', 'scenes', 'suddenly', 'funny.Joanna', 'Whalley', 'once', 'Whalley-Kilmer', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'again', 'only', 'remember', 'what', 'hot', 'commodity', 'was', 'however', 'briefly', 'similar', 'zing', 'proceedings', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'brought', 'AUSTIN', 'POWERS', 'zing', 'familiar', 'boring', 'awhile.I', 'found', 'smiling', 'chuckling', 'fairly', 'frequently', 'film', 'quite', 'good-natured', 'overall', 'recipe', 'wonderful', 'ingredients', 'been', 'undercooked', 'perhaps', 'half-baked', 'ingredients', 'are', 'still', 'wonderful', 'dish', 'whole', 'tough', 'get']",N/A

However, I imagine that that would be just as funny to watch.I imagine the pitch for this film went something like this...""Bill Murray is back, in the new blockbuster side-splitter 'What About Bob: 2'!  This time, Bob is mistaken for a government spy who... What's that? Change the name?  Ok, how about 'The Man Who Knew Too... umm... Little!  Hmm?  What's that? No! This genre has plenty of gas left in the tank.  You're practically guaranteed to make bank on this.""That pretty much sums up this film.  If you find it as easy to laugh at Bill Murray as some people find it to laugh at Will Ferrel, then you might want to plan a few intermissions to stop yourself from getting a hernia.  If not, then pop some extra pop corn so you'll have leftovers to throw at the screen.",4,"""...any regrets?""
