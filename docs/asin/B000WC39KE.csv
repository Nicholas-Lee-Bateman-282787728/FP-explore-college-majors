1108222,AKAYUX1M0PZWB,B000WC39KE,StarYaten,"[0, 0]","I know they won't win any Academy Awards but these films are just entertaining.The first film, Bring it On, has Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, and Gabrielle Union. There are 2 cheer squads, one is a champion and the other is from an school too poor to compete. The champion team has become the champions by stealing the other team's routines in previous years. When the new captain finds out what her squad has been doing she decides to make it right by getting a new routine.  This involves spirit fingers.Bring It On Again is about a girl who goes to college and tries out for their cheer squad. She is initially let on it but finds that she doesn't like the spirit of the squad. She makes another squad at the same school and competes against the primary squad. Not as good as the first movie and no recognizable actors.Bring It On: All or Nothing is about a girl, Hayden Panettiere, from a preppy school who was the cheer leading captain.  Her father loses his job and they have to move into the city where she has to change schools. She is the outcast at the school and butts heads with the cheer leading captain played by Solange Knowles (Beyonce's sister). This new school's squad eventually competes against the old school's squad for a chance to be in Rihanna's music video.Bring it On: In It to Win It is about 2 competing squads at cheer camp.  One squad loses the spirit stick because the other steals it.  Both teams get cursed by it and half their squads are injured.
