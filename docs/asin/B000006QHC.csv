Gibson ""70's tv addict!!!""","[19, 22]","I remember how much I enjoyed watching this biography several years ago when it aired on A&E.; At that time I really did'nt know much about Shirley Temple aside from her being married and acting as an Ambassador, so this biography was quite a treat! Peter Graves did an excellent job narrating (as always)and it included clips from practically all her films and the details of her life at that time. I always find it even more interesting of the stories behind the movies.Naturally after watching Shirley Temple's biography I wished Twentieth Century Fox would start releasing her films. There was a 3 movie collection advertised on tv that seemed too expensive for 3 measley films. Then years later Fox finally started to release most of Shirley's films on video for about 5.99 each at Target. Needless to say they sold like hotcakes and I did'nt waste time collecting them all! Although I've noticed that alot of these films are being converted to dvd I have no intention of buying them all over again, considering most of her films were only about an hour long. However, I will be purchasing this biography on dvd to add to my collection and enjoy the lifestory of the greatest child star of all-time!!!!!",5,THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER  SHIRLEY TEMPLE!!!!!,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,1208,"['remember', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'biography', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'aired', 'A', 'E', 'time', 'really', ""did'nt"", 'know', 'much', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'aside', 'being', 'married', 'acting', 'Ambassador', 'biography', 'was', 'quite', 'treat', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'narrating', 'always', 'included', 'clips', 'practically', 'films', 'details', 'life', 'time', 'always', 'find', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'stories', 'movies.Naturally', 'watching', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'biography', 'wished', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'Fox', 'would', 'start', 'releasing', 'films', 'was', '3', 'movie', 'collection', 'advertised', 'tv', 'seemed', 'too', 'expensive', '3', 'measley', 'films', 'Then', 'years', 'later', 'Fox', 'finally', 'started', 'release', 'most', 'Shirley', 'films', 'video', 'about', '5.99', 'Target', 'Needless', 'say', 'sold', 'hotcakes', ""did'nt"", 'waste', 'time', 'collecting', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'alot', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'converted', 'dvd', 'have', 'intention', 'buying', 'over', 'again', 'considering', 'most', 'films', 'were', 'only', 'hour', 'long', 'However', 'will', 'be', 'purchasing', 'biography', 'dvd', 'add', 'collection', 'enjoy', 'lifestory', 'greatest', 'child', 'star', 'all-time']",N/A
