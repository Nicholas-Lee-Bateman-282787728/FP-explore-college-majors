1289799,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002UJIY20,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","&lt;strong>Dead Tone&lt;/strong> (Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor, 2007)Did I really just watch a horror movie introduced by Flavor Flav? I did. Which leads to the question: why did I keep watching it? This question is a lot more interesting, at least to me, and I'm not sure I can come up with a satisfactory answer--but if I do, rest assured that if you're a slasher film fan, you will probably find the answer as relevant as I do.The movie opens with a bunch of kids whose parents are downstairs partying playing one of those prank-call games that (as all prank-call games do in the movies) ends very badly. Fast- forward a number of years and we have a bunch of college students in the same house deciding to play a prank-call game...if you've seen half a dozen slasher flicks, that sentence-and-a-half synopsis will tell you everything you need to know about this movie, including the identity of the killer, all the major plot twists, and at least two aspects of the movie's ending. This is because Hooks and Taylor have made one of the most by-the-numbers slasher films I've seen in a very long time; I might as well have said ""if you've seen half a dozen slasher flicks, you've seen &lt;em>Dead Tone&lt;/em>"". Which brings us to the ""interesting"" bit: why did I keep watching? Because the film's very derivativeness leads to us being able to define it as safe, in the same way a genre romance novel is safe. You know, going in, exactly what you're going to get. In the romance novel, within a page of a male being introduced, you can type him: he's the hero who will endlessly grate on the heroine's nerves, or he's a bad guy, or he's a supporting character, or he's the Gay Best Friend(TM). Such it is with the formulaic slasher movie. When a bimbo is introduced, she might as well have ""Plant axe here"" tattooed on her forehead. The stoners are going to die. The people who have premarital sex are going to die. (It's kind of amazing that Wes Craven laid out all the rules in &lt;em>Scream&lt;/em> and still no one's thought to look to any sort of paradigm shift.) The final girl, whatever sex the ""final girl"" may have, is the first person in a present-day filmed sequence to get a lingering camera shot. Etc. There's an undeniable comfort in switching on a film and knowing exactly what you're going to get, even down to the endearingly terrible acting and barely-competent cinematography (two of the main reasons this flick seems like it could have come straight out of 1985).In other words, if you're looking for a slasher movie with which to kill time, &lt;em>Dead Tone&lt;/em> is just as good a choice as any of a hundred other films of its type. On the other hand, if you're looking for an active, entertaining experience that pushes boundaries and makes you think about slasher film in a new way, this one is best avoided. * ",2,Slash-by-numbers.,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,2839,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Dead', 'Tone', 'lt', '>', 'Brian', 'Hooks', 'Deon', 'Taylor', '2007', 'Did', 'really', 'just', 'watch', 'horror', 'movie', 'introduced', 'Flavor', 'Flav', 'did', 'Which', 'question', 'why', 'did', 'keep', 'watching', 'question', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'least', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'satisfactory', 'answer', 'do', 'rest', 'assured', ""'re"", 'slasher', 'film', 'fan', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'answer', 'as', 'relevant', 'do.The', 'movie', 'bunch', 'kids', 'parents', 'are', 'downstairs', 'partying', 'playing', 'one', 'prank-call', 'games', 'prank-call', 'games', 'do', 'movies', 'very', 'badly', 'Fast-', 'forward', 'number', 'years', 'have', 'bunch', 'college', 'students', 'same', 'house', 'deciding', 'play', 'prank-call', 'game', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozen', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'sentence-and-a-half', 'synopsis', 'will', 'tell', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'movie', 'including', 'identity', 'killer', 'major', 'plot', 'twists', 'least', 'two', 'aspects', 'movie', 'ending', 'Hooks', 'Taylor', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'by-the-numbers', 'slasher', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'said', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dozen', 'slasher', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lt', 'em', '>', 'Dead', 'Tone', 'lt', '>', 'Which', 'interesting', 'bit', 'why', 'did', 'keep', 'watching', 'film', 'very', 'derivativeness', 'leads', 'being', 'able', 'define', 'safe', 'same', 'way', 'genre', 'romance', 'novel', 'safe', 'know', 'going', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'romance', 'novel', 'page', 'male', 'being', 'introduced', 'can', 'type', 'hero', 'who', 'will', 'endlessly', 'grate', 'heroine', 'nerves', 'bad', 'guy', 'supporting', 'character', 'Gay', 'Best', 'Friend', 'TM', 'Such', 'formulaic', 'slasher', 'movie', 'When', 'bimbo', 'introduced', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'Plant', 'axe', 'here', 'tattooed', 'forehead', 'stoners', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'premarital', 'sex', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'kind', 'amazing', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'laid', 'out', 'rules', 'lt', '>', 'Scream', 'lt', '>', 'still', 'one', 'thought', 'look', 'sort', 'paradigm', 'shift', 'final', 'girl', 'sex', 'final', 'girl', 'may', 'have', 'first', 'person', 'present-day', 'filmed', 'sequence', 'get', 'lingering', 'camera', 'shot', 'Etc', 'undeniable', 'comfort', 'switching', 'film', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'even', 'down', 'endearingly', 'terrible', 'acting', 'barely-competent', 'cinematography', 'two', 'main', 'reasons', 'flick', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'straight', '1985', '.In', 'other', 'words', ""'re"", 'looking', 'slasher', 'movie', 'kill', 'time', 'lt', '>', 'Dead', 'Tone', 'lt', '>', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'choice', 'hundred', 'other', 'films', 'type', 'other', 'hand', ""'re"", 'looking', 'active', 'entertaining', 'experience', 'boundaries', 'think', 'slasher', 'film', 'new', 'way', 'one', 'best', 'avoided', '*']",N/A

1289801,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002UJIY20,trebe,"[0, 0]","Dead Tone (2007) may not be particularly well-written or acted, but at least it mostly delivers in the kill department, as a hooded hatchet wielding killer with at burning desire to spill blood, butchers a group of stupid and annoying college students.  Over the top violence is the film's main attribute, unfortunately it takes nearly an hour for the mayhem to begin.The story begins with a group of young kids at a sleepover, making prank calls.  Later that evening the phone rings, and a man wearing a mask, bursts into the house wielding an axe, and massacres all the parents.  Homicide detective John Criton (Rutger Hauer) is assigned to the case, which remains unsolved.  Moving forward ten years, a young man is found dead from a hatchet wound to the head.  Criton suspects that the same killer may have struck again, and along with his reluctant partner (Gwendoline Yeo), begins working the case.We also meet a guy named Marcus (Brian Hooks), who was apparently one of the kids who survived the attack.  Marcus is the inventor of a game called ""Seventy-Five"", where the goal is to make a random call, and then try to keep whoever answers on the line for at least 75 seconds.  He is part of a group of college friends who tag along with a girl named Karina (Jud Taylor), when she is invited by her ex-boyfriend Brandon O'Connell (Jonathan Chase), to a party at a mansion owned by his father.Despite the past tragedy, the motor-mouthed Marcus is still into playing Seventy-Five, and convinces those at the party to play.  Apparently against impossible odds, once again a psycho killer is prank called, becomes enraged, and threatens to kill everyone in the house.  As he will be reminded later, Marcus doesn't learn from his mistakes, and unconcerned he returns to partying with his girlfriend Anna (Denyce Lawton).  Later that night, a hooded figure (Kyle Turley) with an axe arrives at the house, and begins slicing and dicing party guests.  The carnage starts explosively, but thing come to a halt, when the killer traps Marcus, Katrina, and their friends in Brandon's bedroom.  The survivors are unable to call for help, and after arguing like idiots, they decide to make a break for freedom.  But no matter what they do, death awaits them.Dead Tone features a few mean twists, and a surprise ending that seems quite appropriate.  The film stumbles by coming to a halt down the stretch, and having too many off-screen kills.  Fortunately the action does pick up, leaving few breathing at the end.  The action and kill scenes are competently executed, and are easily the best things about the film, which purposely avoids nudity.  Not intended to be much more than a slaughterfest, the film is padded with unnecessary scenes, and the plot has almost no credibility.  The dialog is terrible, and in general, the acting is laughably bad.  Few of the characters are likeable, and Rutger Hauer isn't present enough to make much of a difference.  For hardcore slasher fans, Dead Tone may be worth a look for the violent kills, but everyone else may want to pass.",3,"terribly unpolished and slow developing, but Dead Tone leaves few still breathing at the end...",1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,3066,"['Dead', 'Tone', '2007', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'particularly', 'well-written', 'acted', 'least', 'mostly', 'kill', 'department', 'hooded', 'hatchet', 'wielding', 'killer', 'burning', 'desire', 'spill', 'blood', 'group', 'stupid', 'annoying', 'college', 'students', 'top', 'violence', 'film', 'main', 'attribute', 'unfortunately', 'nearly', 'hour', 'mayhem', 'begin.The', 'story', 'group', 'young', 'kids', 'sleepover', 'making', 'prank', 'calls', 'Later', 'evening', 'phone', 'rings', 'man', 'wearing', 'mask', 'house', 'wielding', 'axe', 'parents', 'Homicide', 'detective', 'John', 'Criton', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'assigned', 'case', 'unsolved', 'Moving', 'forward', 'ten', 'years', 'young', 'man', 'found', 'dead', 'hatchet', 'wound', 'head', 'Criton', 'same', 'killer', 'may', 'have', 'struck', 'again', 'reluctant', 'partner', 'Gwendoline', 'Yeo', 'working', 'case.We', 'also', 'guy', 'named', 'Marcus', 'Brian', 'Hooks', 'who', 'was', 'apparently', 'one', 'kids', 'who', 'survived', 'attack', 'Marcus', 'inventor', 'game', 'called', 'Seventy-Five', 'where', 'goal', 'make', 'random', 'call', 'then', 'try', 'keep', 'whoever', 'answers', 'line', 'least', '75', 'seconds', 'part', 'group', 'college', 'friends', 'who', 'tag', 'girl', 'named', 'Karina', 'Jud', 'Taylor', 'when', 'invited', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Brandon', ""O'Connell"", 'Jonathan', 'Chase', 'party', 'mansion', 'owned', 'father.Despite', 'past', 'tragedy', 'motor-mouthed', 'Marcus', 'still', 'playing', 'Seventy-Five', 'convinces', 'party', 'play', 'Apparently', 'impossible', 'odds', 'once', 'again', 'psycho', 'killer', 'prank', 'called', 'enraged', 'kill', 'everyone', 'house', 'will', 'be', 'reminded', 'later', 'Marcus', ""n't"", 'learn', 'mistakes', 'unconcerned', 'partying', 'girlfriend', 'Anna', 'Denyce', 'Lawton', 'Later', 'night', 'hooded', 'figure', 'Kyle', 'Turley', 'axe', 'house', 'slicing', 'dicing', 'party', 'guests', 'carnage', 'explosively', 'thing', 'come', 'halt', 'when', 'killer', 'traps', 'Marcus', 'Katrina', 'friends', 'Brandon', 'bedroom', 'survivors', 'are', 'unable', 'call', 'help', 'arguing', 'idiots', 'decide', 'make', 'break', 'freedom', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'death', 'awaits', 'them.Dead', 'Tone', 'few', 'mean', 'twists', 'surprise', 'ending', 'quite', 'appropriate', 'film', 'stumbles', 'coming', 'halt', 'down', 'stretch', 'having', 'too', 'many', 'off-screen', 'kills', 'Fortunately', 'action', 'pick', 'up', 'leaving', 'few', 'breathing', 'end', 'action', 'kill', 'scenes', 'are', 'competently', 'executed', 'are', 'easily', 'best', 'things', 'film', 'purposely', 'nudity', 'Not', 'intended', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'slaughterfest', 'film', 'padded', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'plot', 'almost', 'credibility', 'dialog', 'terrible', 'general', 'acting', 'laughably', 'bad', 'Few', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', ""n't"", 'present', 'enough', 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'hardcore', 'slasher', 'fans', 'Dead', 'Tone', 'may', 'be', 'look', 'violent', 'kills', 'everyone', 'else', 'may', 'want', 'pass']",N/A
