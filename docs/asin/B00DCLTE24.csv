Is it because Horror movies aren't allowed to be watchable? I'm not sure. This movie had the camera jumping so badly that you weren't scared, you were sea sick. Not scary, just stupid.And why the list of everything that happened in the place, but the only thing there was 3 little ghost girls? Why them? What was with the initial scene they showed?

One by one they get yanked off their feet and dragged down the corridors at a rate of knots.Ho hum. The only mysteries here are how they managed to set up so many cameras without anyone noticing; why the crying dead (presumably the three little girls) are so named - I never once heard them cry and, what's more, at the end of this dreadful effort they are positively dancing for joy. Maybe they were crying with laughter, I don't know. The audio cut out at the end of the stream but by this point I was beyond caring.The biggest mystery of all is how anyone could think this was a film worth making.Not quite as amateurish and wretched as some of the horrors I've subjected myself to recently but boring and pointless all the same.Another to avoid.",1,Pointless,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,892,"['Yet', 'excursion', 'haunted', 'hospital', 'territory', 'six', 'people', 'investigate', 'mystery', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'burned', 'death', 'fire', 'One', 'one', 'get', 'yanked', 'off', 'feet', 'dragged', 'down', 'corridors', 'rate', 'knots.Ho', 'hum', 'only', 'mysteries', 'here', 'are', 'how', 'managed', 'set', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'cameras', 'anyone', 'noticing', 'why', 'crying', 'dead', 'presumably', 'three', 'little', 'girls', 'are', 'so', 'named', 'never', 'once', 'heard', 'cry', 'what', 'more', 'end', 'dreadful', 'effort', 'are', 'positively', 'dancing', 'joy', 'Maybe', 'were', 'crying', 'laughter', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'audio', 'cut', 'out', 'end', 'stream', 'point', 'was', 'caring.The', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'film', 'worth', 'making.Not', 'quite', 'amateurish', 'wretched', 'horrors', ""'ve"", 'subjected', 'recently', 'boring', 'pointless', 'same.Another', 'avoid']",The Crying Dead

Thank God nobody is wasting film on this garbage anymore that will stay in a landfill for 200 years once it's thrown out and it can be deleted with the click of a mouse.This is the result of what happens when everybody gets a trophy.

Sheesh.I haven't seen a good low budget film in over a decade. This should be called no budget, but I suppose they spent $49 bucks at Wal-Mart on one of those throw away phones to film it on so 'technically' there was a budget.
