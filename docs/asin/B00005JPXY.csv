658601,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JPXY,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[3, 5]","To give the utmost atmosphere of authenticity, `Cloverfield' films all its monster movie proceedings as though an amateur were using an average video camera.  All the starts and stops of footage are effective enough, and the glimpses of the modern equivalent of New York City's Godzilla keep tangible, but not always present.Just like all disaster pictures, the prologue introduces us to all of the characters.  We need to know and care about them.  Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) and Beth McIntyre (Odette Yustman) wake up and talk of making a day of Coney Island for her first time.  Then, his brother, Jason (Mike Vogel) takes over the camera later, and gets involved with a going away party for Rob, who has a job promotion in Japan.  Meanwhile, he and Beth have grown apart because of his move and some alleged infidelity. Beth comes with another date.  He and Beth have a tiff, and all the gossip hits the fan (or at least the camera).  To pass off the duty of filming little testimonial ""good-bye"" snippets, their friend, Hud (T.J. Miller), takes the camera.  Jason's girlfriend, Lily (Jessica Lucas), gets bossy with the festivities, particularly with Hud.  Interestingly enough he is a little shaky as a novice cameraman, but as chaos ensues into the night, he only improves.  Hud hits on Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), one of the shrinking violets who gets on the spot being filmed on camera.  Amazingly, Hud gets enough juicy gossip that no one finally shoves the camera in his face.Just as our exposition becomes colorful and sordid enough, their apartment complex is shaken, the camera weaves back and forth, and lights flicker on and off.  News reports tell of an earthquake near Manhattan with a possible ensuing oil spill.  Chaos spills out in the streets in 9/11-like fashion as people run and shriek as some yet unseen hazard.  Effectively, Hud runs with the camera out of breath.  After a cell phone call with Beth, Rob, resolved and chivalrous, goes against the grain of the crowd and heads towards Beth's apartment on the side of town seen to contain the most peril.  Jason, Marlena, Hud, and Lilly try to reason with him to stay with the flow, but Rob refuses, eventually talking them into going to save Beth.  Soon Jason is killed, and they must think and act quickly.Much of the movie goes through the subway system, fending off more than one big monster as military personnel occasionally whiz past their direction, fighting all the city's aliens and gathering the injured civilians.With a running time of 1:19 'Cloverfield' wisely tightens up its story as South Korea's 'The Host' failed to do. In that movie, it started out awesomely wild and scary, but lingered too long and drum beat it's satiric message to death.  After 9/11, I must admit my eyes welled up with tears several times during the movie.  A pre-9/11 'Cloverfield' would have had me engrossed in an arcade, the kind the Superman movies of the late seventies and early eighties did, but not any more.  However, a pre-9/11 `Cloverfield' wouldn't be the same, either.  The frightening scenes do their job, but they mostly go for reality, which they do in spades.  Suspension of belief is seldom an issue.Fading reality:  Only three parts didn't do it for me.  One is when they're on the subway tracks talking about Superman as if he were real.  Did they decide to do dialogue, so we'd know this isn't `War of the Worlds' after making things so lively and genuine?  Also, when they come upon a military medical tent, one army man says, ""The monster is winning.""  To me in real life, gung ho military personnel say something heartening but honest like ""We're going to beat this thing, don't worry!""  Of course that would tip the dramatic tension, but reality was the movie's goal.  I also think at one point, the camera would get dropped sooner than it did, but that doesn't work to make this movie.From other reviews, I was suspicious 'Cloverfield' would get shaky views to the point of irritation or tedium.  I didn't feel that way.  In a small way, 'Cloverfield' is a mini 'Matrix' or 'Blair Witch Project,' innovative and effective enough to steal our interest and undoubtedly spawn more films to compete with this one.A JP's Pick 4*'s= Very Good",4,Commotion in Motion,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,4233,"['give', 'utmost', 'atmosphere', 'authenticity', 'Cloverfield', 'films', 'monster', 'movie', 'proceedings', 'amateur', 'were', 'using', 'average', 'video', 'camera', 'starts', 'stops', 'footage', 'are', 'effective', 'enough', 'glimpses', 'modern', 'equivalent', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Godzilla', 'keep', 'tangible', 'not', 'always', 'present.Just', 'disaster', 'pictures', 'prologue', 'characters', 'need', 'know', 'care', 'Rob', 'Hawkins', 'Michael', 'Stahl-David', 'Beth', 'McIntyre', 'Odette', 'Yustman', 'wake', 'up', 'talk', 'making', 'day', 'Coney', 'Island', 'first', 'time', 'Then', 'brother', 'Jason', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'camera', 'later', 'involved', 'going', 'away', 'party', 'Rob', 'who', 'job', 'promotion', 'Japan', 'Meanwhile', 'Beth', 'have', 'grown', 'apart', 'move', 'alleged', 'infidelity', 'Beth', 'date', 'Beth', 'have', 'tiff', 'gossip', 'fan', 'least', 'camera', 'pass', 'off', 'duty', 'filming', 'little', 'testimonial', 'good-bye', 'snippets', 'friend', 'Hud', 'T.J.', 'Miller', 'camera', 'Jason', 'girlfriend', 'Lily', 'Jessica', 'Lucas', 'bossy', 'festivities', 'particularly', 'Hud', 'Interestingly', 'little', 'shaky', 'novice', 'cameraman', 'chaos', 'night', 'only', 'Hud', 'Marlena', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'one', 'shrinking', 'violets', 'who', 'spot', 'being', 'filmed', 'camera', 'Amazingly', 'Hud', 'enough', 'juicy', 'gossip', 'one', 'finally', 'camera', 'face.Just', 'exposition', 'colorful', 'sordid', 'enough', 'apartment', 'complex', 'shaken', 'camera', 'back', 'forth', 'lights', 'flicker', 'News', 'reports', 'tell', 'earthquake', 'Manhattan', 'possible', 'ensuing', 'oil', 'spill', 'Chaos', 'out', 'streets', '9/11-like', 'fashion', 'people', 'run', 'shriek', 'yet', 'unseen', 'hazard', 'Effectively', 'Hud', 'camera', 'breath', 'cell', 'phone', 'call', 'Beth', 'Rob', 'resolved', 'chivalrous', 'grain', 'crowd', 'heads', 'towards', 'Beth', 'apartment', 'side', 'town', 'seen', 'contain', 'most', 'peril', 'Jason', 'Marlena', 'Hud', 'Lilly', 'try', 'reason', 'stay', 'flow', 'Rob', 'eventually', 'talking', 'going', 'save', 'Beth', 'Soon', 'Jason', 'killed', 'must', 'think', 'act', 'quickly.Much', 'movie', 'subway', 'system', 'fending', 'off', 'more', 'one', 'big', 'monster', 'military', 'personnel', 'occasionally', 'whiz', 'direction', 'fighting', 'city', 'aliens', 'gathering', 'injured', 'civilians.With', 'running', 'time', '1:19', 'wisely', 'up', 'story', 'South', 'Korea', 'Host', 'failed', 'do', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'awesomely', 'wild', 'scary', 'lingered', 'too', 'long', 'drum', 'beat', 'satiric', 'message', 'death', '9/11', 'must', 'admit', 'eyes', 'welled', 'up', 'tears', 'several', 'times', 'movie', 'pre-9/11', ""'Cloverfield"", 'would', 'have', 'had', 'engrossed', 'arcade', 'kind', 'Superman', 'movies', 'late', 'seventies', 'early', 'eighties', 'did', 'not', 'more', 'However', 'pre-9/11', 'Cloverfield', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'either', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'do', 'job', 'mostly', 'go', 'reality', 'do', 'spades', 'Suspension', 'belief', 'seldom', 'issue.Fading', 'reality', 'Only', 'three', 'parts', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'One', 'when', ""'re"", 'subway', 'talking', 'about', 'Superman', 'were', 'real', 'Did', 'decide', 'do', 'dialogue', ""'d"", 'know', ""n't"", 'War', 'Worlds', 'making', 'things', 'so', 'lively', 'genuine', 'Also', 'when', 'come', 'military', 'medical', 'tent', 'one', 'army', 'man', 'monster', 'winning', 'real', 'life', 'gung', 'ho', 'military', 'personnel', 'say', 'something', 'heartening', 'honest', ""'re"", 'going', 'beat', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'course', 'would', 'tip', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'reality', 'was', 'movie', 'goal', 'also', 'think', 'one', 'point', 'camera', 'would', 'get', 'dropped', 'sooner', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'make', 'movie.From', 'other', 'reviews', 'was', 'suspicious', ""'Cloverfield"", 'would', 'get', 'shaky', 'views', 'point', 'irritation', 'tedium', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'way', 'small', 'way', ""'Cloverfield"", 'mini', ""'Matrix"", 'Witch', 'Project', 'innovative', 'effective', 'enough', 'steal', 'interest', 'undoubtedly', 'spawn', 'more', 'films', 'compete', 'one.A', 'JP', 'Pick', ""4*'s="", 'Very', 'Good']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release
658602,A1NOLEWY3EBW01,B00005JPXY,683,"[1, 3]","""Cloverfield"" is a pretty scary movie. It has a bit of everything in it. Horror, action, romance, comedy, drama; it has a lot of genres into it. The film isn't very long, and it may not have a lot to it, but it's still a very-well executed movie. The opening card in the beginning was pretty cool, with that ""government"" and ""case designate Cloverfield"" thing. That was an interesting way to begin the film. It finally rolls into the actual footage. The character development in the beginning was good, and I read  that in the reviews for this movie that the characters were ""one-dimensional"", but in basically every ""found-footage"" film the people are one-dimensional. I bet nobody would be complaining about that if the film had regular camera cuts and weren't found footage.Anyway, besides that, after about 18 minutes, the action finally begins with a loud boom. This movie is more intense because it's a large group of people screaming and freaking out. Another thing that makes this film pretty creepy is that it has this ""apocalypse"" feel to it. There's a lot of running and terror in the film. I guess the running made people get motion sickness, but it's their fault that they got motion sickness. They're the ones who saw the movie and they saw that it was done on video camera, and it obviously involves running, so it's basically their fault. I like the extreme shaky camera, and the pixelation, and how in some scenes it would cut back to footage from a month ago for a couple seconds. I also like those freaky-looking spider creatures in that one subway scene. The special effects were also great (it only had a $25 million budget).I like how they only show little bits and pieces of the monster throughout the movie and at the end you finally see the whole thing in front of the camera. It's pretty scary looking. The end obviously doesn't explain everything (that's what a lot of people complained about), but I actually think it ended really well, with a cliffhanger. At the last shot in the movie, I like when it cuts back to a month ago and the last line in the movie is ""I had a good day"". The film may not have a lot to it, like I said before. It plays out like this, the ""a month ago"" scene, the party scene, the running scene, the subway scene, the mall scene, hotel scene, and it finally shows the monster and after that there's a couple more minutes. It may sound like a good amount, but for a movie that's not much. I'm not complaining about it, because I think the movie actually played out really well.The audio at the way end when you hear ""Help us"" and when it's played backwards, you hear ""It's still alive"", was pretty cool, because it adds on to the cliffhanger effect, and it does make the movie even more creepier. Altogether, I think that even 3 years after the release of Cloverfield, the film is still worth watching again.",5,"Another great ""found-footage"" film",1301529600,"03 31, 2011",2011,2861,"['Cloverfield', 'pretty', 'scary', 'movie', 'bit', 'everything', 'Horror', 'action', 'romance', 'comedy', 'drama', 'lot', 'genres', 'film', ""n't"", 'very', 'long', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'still', 'very-well', 'executed', 'movie', 'opening', 'card', 'beginning', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'government', 'case', 'designate', 'Cloverfield', 'thing', 'was', 'interesting', 'way', 'begin', 'film', 'finally', 'actual', 'footage', 'character', 'development', 'beginning', 'was', 'good', 'read', 'reviews', 'movie', 'characters', 'were', 'one-dimensional', 'basically', 'found-footage', 'film', 'people', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'bet', 'nobody', 'would', 'be', 'complaining', 'film', 'had', 'regular', 'camera', 'cuts', 'were', ""n't"", 'found', 'footage.Anyway', '18', 'minutes', 'action', 'finally', 'loud', 'boom', 'movie', 'more', 'intense', 'large', 'group', 'people', 'screaming', 'freaking', 'out', 'thing', 'film', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'apocalypse', 'feel', 'lot', 'running', 'terror', 'film', 'guess', 'running', 'made', 'people', 'get', 'motion', 'sickness', 'fault', 'got', 'motion', 'sickness', ""'re"", 'ones', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'saw', 'was', 'done', 'video', 'camera', 'obviously', 'running', 'basically', 'fault', 'like', 'extreme', 'shaky', 'camera', 'pixelation', 'how', 'scenes', 'would', 'cut', 'back', 'footage', 'month', 'ago', 'couple', 'seconds', 'also', 'like', 'freaky-looking', 'spider', 'creatures', 'one', 'subway', 'scene', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'only', 'had', '25', 'million', 'budget', 'how', 'only', 'show', 'little', 'bits', 'pieces', 'monster', 'movie', 'end', 'finally', 'see', 'whole', 'thing', 'front', 'camera', 'pretty', 'scary', 'looking', 'end', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'explain', 'everything', 'what', 'lot', 'people', 'complained', 'actually', 'think', 'ended', 'really', 'well', 'cliffhanger', 'last', 'shot', 'movie', 'like', 'when', 'back', 'month', 'ago', 'last', 'line', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'day', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'said', 'out', 'month', 'ago', 'scene', 'party', 'scene', 'running', 'scene', 'subway', 'scene', 'mall', 'scene', 'hotel', 'scene', 'finally', 'monster', 'couple', 'more', 'minutes', 'may', 'sound', 'good', 'amount', 'movie', 'not', 'much', ""'m"", 'not', 'complaining', 'think', 'movie', 'actually', 'played', 'out', 'really', 'well.The', 'audio', 'way', 'end', 'when', 'hear', 'Help', 'when', 'played', 'backwards', 'hear', 'still', 'alive', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'cliffhanger', 'effect', 'make', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'creepier', 'Altogether', 'think', 'even', '3', 'years', 'release', 'Cloverfield', 'film', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'again']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

I personally found it to be a very entertaining and interesting movie about how people react to disasters of epic proportions.  It's a very different take on the disaster movie, and a far better way to approach the genre than rehashing the same ground tread by movies like Independence Day.  The hand-held camera work did not bother me, but I know it is a major stumbling block for many viewers.While I really do like this movie, I'm not thrilled with the DVD.  The features are relatively weak and short.  You will learn absolutely nothing substantial about the backstory.  The commentary is dry and technical.  A few of the ""making of"" features are mildly interesting, but only mildly.  I'm guessing that we'll see a special edition sometime in the future with a far better set of features.  For now, I'd advise only renting this edition.Overall, I'd give the movie four stars and the DVD two stars, hence three stars for both.",3,"Great movie, weak DVD edition",1209168000,"04 26, 2008",2008,955,"['movie', 'what', 'personally', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'movie', 'how', 'people', 'react', 'disasters', 'epic', 'proportions', 'very', 'different', 'take', 'disaster', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'way', 'approach', 'genre', 'rehashing', 'same', 'ground', 'tread', 'movies', 'Independence', 'Day', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'work', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'know', 'major', 'stumbling', 'block', 'many', 'viewers.While', 'really', 'do', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'thrilled', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'relatively', 'weak', 'short', 'will', 'learn', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'substantial', 'backstory', 'commentary', 'dry', 'technical', 'few', 'making', 'features', 'are', 'mildly', 'interesting', 'only', 'mildly', ""'m"", 'guessing', ""'ll"", 'see', 'special', 'edition', 'sometime', 'future', 'far', 'better', 'set', 'features', 'now', ""'d"", 'advise', 'only', 'renting', 'edition.Overall', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'DVD', 'two', 'stars', 'hence', 'three', 'stars']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

Even during the disaster, he was making jokes and saying things like ""ROB, ROB, ROB, ROB,"" and ""You guys see that?""

How could the monster ""know"" where they were all the time?  During the rescue attempt, the chopper flies close above the monster; how dumb can you be?

It keeps everything grounded and ground-level, in the very best sense, as the small (and dwindling) group of characters struggle not to beat the monster but simply to survive.On the big screen, the action is vertiginous (my friend had to leave after about 20 minutes, because the videocam shooting technique was making her queasy). This is less pronounced on the video, though, which is a good thing.There are lots of surprises and shocks, but keep your eye out for two small bits in particular-- the shot at Coney Island at the very end, and a vocal bit after the credits stop rolling.CLOVERFIELD is likely to spawn a number of lesser imitations but this one is a keeper.",4,Dynamite new take on giant monster movies,1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,979,"['CLOVERFIELD', 'one', 'movies', 'think', 'could', 'become', 'cult', 'smash', 'video', 'store', 'reliable', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'quietly', 'fade', 'away.You', 'probably', 'know', 'conceit', 'movie', 'goodbye', 'reel', 'shot', 'farewell', 'party', 'documentary', 'New', 'York', 'suffering', 'genuine', 'Godzilla', 'event', 'everything', 'grounded', 'ground-level', 'very', 'best', 'sense', 'small', 'dwindling', 'group', 'characters', 'struggle', 'not', 'beat', 'monster', 'simply', 'survive.On', 'big', 'screen', 'action', 'vertiginous', 'friend', 'had', 'leave', '20', 'minutes', 'videocam', 'shooting', 'technique', 'was', 'making', 'queasy', 'less', 'pronounced', 'video', 'though', 'good', 'are', 'lots', 'surprises', 'shocks', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'two', 'small', 'bits', 'particular', 'shot', 'Coney', 'Island', 'very', 'end', 'vocal', 'bit', 'credits', 'stop', 'rolling.CLOVERFIELD', 'likely', 'spawn', 'number', 'lesser', 'imitations', 'one', 'keeper']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

It's also been years since a really good monster movie was made. The Host was disappointing as a monster movie, and I was afraid Cloverfield would shower me in disappointment like The Host. Luckily, that wasn't the case.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Manhattan, New York. What started as a going away party that was being recorded on camera for happy memories for a guy named Rob thrown by his friends and his brother, ends up being a worst nightmare that is documented via cam corder when an earthquake occurs and an explosion rips through the city. As all the party members try to escape from the area the Statue of Liberty's head is thrown at a building and into a street. After that shocking moment, a building collapses filling the street with a thick dust cloud and debris. No one can identify the mysterious creature wreaking this havok (It looks like a creature from the PS3 game Resistance: Fall of Man). The story is focused on four friends; Rob, Lilly, Hud, and Elana who are trying to get to a friend's apartment who was left behind in the city, and try not to get killed by the giant creature and the little monsters it drops off to eat people. This film is suspenseful, bizarre, has great characters, and is even a little gory.MUSIC: For some reason there is none. It makes sense considering this film is all done with a cam corder and is trying to be realistic, but it still would have been nice.SOUND: This film sounds great in surround sound with the explosions, screams, and monster roaring.ACTION: This film is loaded with explosions, fire fights between the army and the creature, and some bloody scenes.ENTERTAINMENT: It seems people on this site are mixed about this film despite the wide critical acclaim. So for now I'll just recommend it as a rental. This film delivers scares and it's one of the best monster films made in years.OVERALL: Rent before buy.THE GOOD: Lots of destruction, some bloody scenes, cool creature designs, good characters, decent storyline, and the cam corder documentation is great.THE BAD: No music, camera can make some people dizzy.",5,ONE OF THE BEST MONSTER MOVIES EVER  9 OUT OF 10,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",2008,2143,"['been', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'monster', 'movie', 'truly', 'impressed', 'also', 'been', 'years', 'really', 'good', 'monster', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Host', 'was', 'disappointing', 'monster', 'movie', 'was', 'afraid', 'Cloverfield', 'would', 'shower', 'disappointment', 'Host', 'Luckily', 'was', ""n't"", 'case.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Manhattan', 'New', 'York', 'What', 'started', 'going', 'away', 'party', 'was', 'being', 'recorded', 'camera', 'happy', 'memories', 'guy', 'named', 'Rob', 'thrown', 'friends', 'brother', 'up', 'being', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'documented', 'cam', 'corder', 'when', 'earthquake', 'occurs', 'explosion', 'city', 'party', 'members', 'try', 'escape', 'area', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'head', 'thrown', 'building', 'street', 'shocking', 'moment', 'building', 'filling', 'street', 'thick', 'dust', 'cloud', 'debris', 'one', 'can', 'identify', 'mysterious', 'creature', 'wreaking', 'havok', 'creature', 'PS3', 'game', 'Resistance', 'Fall', 'Man', 'story', 'focused', 'four', 'friends', 'Rob', 'Lilly', 'Hud', 'Elana', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'friend', 'apartment', 'who', 'was', 'left', 'city', 'try', 'not', 'get', 'killed', 'giant', 'creature', 'little', 'monsters', 'eat', 'people', 'film', 'suspenseful', 'bizarre', 'great', 'characters', 'even', 'little', 'gory.MUSIC', 'reason', 'none', 'sense', 'considering', 'film', 'done', 'cam', 'corder', 'trying', 'be', 'realistic', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice.SOUND', 'film', 'great', 'surround', 'sound', 'explosions', 'screams', 'monster', 'roaring.ACTION', 'film', 'loaded', 'explosions', 'fire', 'fights', 'army', 'creature', 'bloody', 'scenes.ENTERTAINMENT', 'people', 'site', 'are', 'mixed', 'film', 'wide', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'now', ""'ll"", 'just', 'recommend', 'rental', 'film', 'scares', 'one', 'best', 'monster', 'films', 'made', 'years.OVERALL', 'Rent', 'buy.THE', 'GOOD', 'Lots', 'destruction', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'cool', 'creature', 'designs', 'good', 'characters', 'decent', 'storyline', 'cam', 'corder', 'documentation', 'great.THE', 'BAD', 'music', 'camera', 'can', 'make', 'people', 'dizzy']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

It is essentially the journey of four New Yorkers through a Manhattan that is under attack by a Godzilla-like monster, taken from the perspective of a handheld camcorder that is carried with.  While the actors are far from well known, I feel that it gave the film a genuine feel.  Seeing Brad Pitt running around just doesn't make it feel real, honestly.  Some people were not fans of the camcorder, as it tends to get a little wild during action sequences, but I think its usage made the film truly unique.  It's filmed nearly as live-action--that is, it's like watching your own home video, except with a monster frolicking around.I definitely recommend this movie.  I will say, though, that it is far better to watch in the theaters or on a big screen TV with surround sound.

I think the fact that these people were acting like you or I was a good idea in that it was an amateur filming the whole event.Third, I was very impressed with the lack of monster sightings.  Normally, the monster is seen way too much.  The film had a creepiness to it that I could appreciate because I love being creeped out!  Then, when you do finally see Clover, it's really gross!  The way its arms look alone just made me shudder.Fourth, if you watch the extras on the DVD, you will be amazed at how much of the movie was CGI.  I'm very critical of this kind of thing.  For instance, I'm appalled at the newer Godzilla flicks and the bad CGI.  Stick with the rubbermonster suits, guys.Now, I do find a couple of things I did not like:  Marlena's and Beth's injuries were quite severe, yet they both were able to just walk around like normal!

The conceit of the film, dubbed ""the first great horror movie of the millennium"" by one critic, is that the destruction of New York as seen, more or less accidentally, through the lens of a hand-held video recorder. A gaggle of irritating Yuppies have come to bid a fond farewell to one of their friends who has accepted a job in Japan (home of Godzilla, natch). The idea of a hand-held camera, brutally beaten to death in The Blair Witch Project a few years ago, works very well here, as the lens is small enough to capture only parts of what is happening as the Big Apple gets chewed, making the audience's imagination do all of the work. And, as the early Universal horror films used the horrific memories of the maimed and tortured from World War I, Cloverfield uses the memories of the destruction wrought by 9/11. The conceit of the amateur video---no music, just stark reality---brings immediacy to the proceedings that really work.

658612,A2QMLRALDX4U2B,B00005JPXY,"Alexander Kemestrios Ben ""A.K.""","[0, 1]","Cloverfield is an interesting movie on many different levels. The movie is postmodern; delighting in pastiche and eclectic borrowing. The intrepid viewer quickly sees the affinity between Cloverfield, the Blair Witch, 1950s monster movies, traditional sci-fi, etc. This is not to be derided; it is to be applauded. There is certainly nothing wrong with using a syncretic blend of influences to create an original movie. I think the po-mo attitude is: ""Screw it, it has all been done before. We might as well be open about our borrowing.""The use of a shaky cam in Cloverfield- alas Blair Witch and Bourne- was a smart move. It creates the intended nausea and vertigo. The psychological state created sets the tone for a fast pased, taut monster movie thriller. On a superficial level, then, the movie is a fairly straighforward and succesful one. No complaints.On a more symbolic level, it seems fairly evident that the movie serves as a Post-9/11 statement on terrorism. The choice of Manhattan was not abitrary. Indeed, the fact that we never see the monster clearly is indicative of terrorism in general: who are we fighting against? Is terrorism as we percieve it even real? Cloverfield seems to be telling us that blind fear of the unknown drives our population to support wars and foreign adventures that might not be in our own interests. Clearly, in the movie, the military option is untenable and actually does more harm than good. Are we doing the same thing in the Middle East? Is creating a nebulous reification called terrorism, and fighting 'it', feasible, or are we just harking back to the days of the red menace? Whether or not the movie intended to be used as a political statement, the parrallelisms are limpid enough. Hey, it is a postmodern era, free readings of texts should be encouraged, right?There is much more to this movie than meets the eye. However, what meets the eye is pretty darned entertaining. Did it live up to the hype? No. There is irony in this. Was the hype not manufactured on purpose through various media outlets: the internet, TV, radio, etc.? Are these not the same mediums that hype the ""War on Terror?"" Are either worthy of the hype? I do not think so. Do you think the people hyping this movie were not aware of this? I think they were clever enough to show us just how powerful the media is in our day.",4,Interesting on many levels.,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,2351,"['Cloverfield', 'interesting', 'movie', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'movie', 'postmodern', 'delighting', 'pastiche', 'eclectic', 'borrowing', 'intrepid', 'viewer', 'quickly', 'affinity', 'Cloverfield', 'Blair', 'Witch', '1950s', 'monster', 'movies', 'traditional', 'sci-fi', 'etc', 'not', 'be', 'derided', 'be', 'applauded', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'using', 'syncretic', 'blend', 'influences', 'create', 'original', 'movie', 'think', 'po-mo', 'attitude', 'Screw', 'all', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'open', 'borrowing', 'use', 'shaky', 'cam', 'Cloverfield-', 'alas', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Bourne-', 'was', 'smart', 'move', 'intended', 'nausea', 'vertigo', 'psychological', 'state', 'created', 'sets', 'tone', 'fast', 'pased', 'taut', 'monster', 'movie', 'thriller', 'superficial', 'level', 'then', 'movie', 'fairly', 'straighforward', 'succesful', 'one', 'complaints.On', 'more', 'symbolic', 'level', 'fairly', 'evident', 'movie', 'Post-9/11', 'statement', 'terrorism', 'choice', 'Manhattan', 'was', 'not', 'abitrary', 'Indeed', 'fact', 'never', 'see', 'monster', 'clearly', 'indicative', 'terrorism', 'general', 'who', 'are', 'fighting', 'terrorism', 'percieve', 'even', 'real', 'Cloverfield', 'be', 'telling', 'blind', 'fear', 'unknown', 'drives', 'population', 'support', 'wars', 'foreign', 'adventures', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'own', 'interests', 'Clearly', 'movie', 'military', 'option', 'untenable', 'actually', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'Are', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'Middle', 'East', 'creating', 'nebulous', 'reification', 'called', 'terrorism', 'fighting', ""'it"", 'feasible', 'are', 'just', 'harking', 'back', 'days', 'red', 'menace', 'Whether', 'not', 'movie', 'intended', 'be', 'used', 'political', 'statement', 'parrallelisms', 'are', 'limpid', 'enough', 'Hey', 'postmodern', 'era', 'free', 'readings', 'texts', 'should', 'be', 'encouraged', 'right', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'eye', 'However', 'what', 'eye', 'pretty', 'darned', 'entertaining', 'Did', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'No', 'irony', 'Was', 'hype', 'not', 'manufactured', 'purpose', 'various', 'media', 'outlets', 'internet', 'TV', 'radio', 'etc.', 'Are', 'not', 'same', 'mediums', 'hype', 'War', 'Terror', 'Are', 'worthy', 'hype', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'so', 'Do', 'think', 'people', 'hyping', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'aware', 'think', 'were', 'clever', 'enough', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'powerful', 'media', 'day']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

Personally, I loved the movie, my parents went with me to see it last night and my dad was impressed, my mom couldn't watch it due to motion sickness.  Pretty much it has the same type of filming that the ""Blair Witch"" had, which was unsteady shots and jearky, which was expected considering the film was supposed to have been shot with a good old fashioned cam corder.  Pesonally, I liked the raw look given by the cam corder, it made me feel like I was actually a part of the movie and for it to have the effects that it did made it seem so realistic.  Now, enough about the filming, let me talk about the movie itself.  The acting was very believeable, the story very structured, and it was especially creepy considering the creature didn't ever have a name or origin.  The actors in this film touch a point that I have been pondering for quite some time.  It is a known fact that prehistoric fish, that were thought to have been extinct have been discovered, and also there is the lock ness monster.  The point given by the camera man is if these things exist what more is out in the water just waiting.  Overall, there are many scenes that are breath taking and very unexpected, pretty much when the head of the statue of liberty rolls down the street with bite and slash marks on it, you realize then anything is possiable, and truthfully it is.",5,A Masterpiece,1200787200,"01 20, 2008",2008,1414,"['Unfourtuantly', 'have', 'start', 'review', 'little', 'negative', 'Personally', 'loved', 'movie', 'parents', 'went', 'see', 'last', 'night', 'dad', 'was', 'impressed', 'mom', 'could', ""n't"", 'watch', 'due', 'motion', 'sickness', 'Pretty', 'much', 'same', 'type', 'filming', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'had', 'was', 'unsteady', 'shots', 'jearky', 'was', 'expected', 'considering', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'cam', 'corder', 'Pesonally', 'liked', 'raw', 'look', 'given', 'cam', 'corder', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'actually', 'part', 'movie', 'have', 'effects', 'did', 'made', 'seem', 'so', 'realistic', 'Now', 'enough', 'filming', 'let', 'talk', 'movie', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'believeable', 'story', 'very', 'structured', 'was', 'especially', 'creepy', 'considering', 'creature', 'did', ""n't"", 'ever', 'have', 'name', 'origin', 'actors', 'film', 'touch', 'point', 'have', 'been', 'pondering', 'quite', 'time', 'known', 'fact', 'prehistoric', 'fish', 'were', 'thought', 'have', 'been', 'extinct', 'have', 'been', 'discovered', 'also', 'lock', 'ness', 'monster', 'point', 'given', 'camera', 'man', 'things', 'exist', 'what', 'more', 'out', 'water', 'just', 'waiting', 'Overall', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'taking', 'very', 'unexpected', 'pretty', 'much', 'when', 'head', 'statue', 'liberty', 'rolls', 'down', 'street', 'bite', 'slash', 'marks', 'realize', 'then', 'anything', 'possiable', 'truthfully']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

No less.Boosted by a remarkable marketing campaign (which involved the five-minute snippet involving Lady Liberty's head rolling down a New York street, as well as misleading Japanese ads, and fake international news reports of oil rigs being mysteriously sucked down in the middle of the ocean) the film had fans lined up, eager to finally see the source of all destruction, the infamous Cloverfield monster. Producer J.J. Abrams (of MI:III and Lost fame) and first-time director Matt Reeves had a lot of expectations to live up to. And boy, do they deliver.""Blair Witch"" meets ""Godzilla""? More or less, but it's more than that. While the makers of ""The Blair Witch Project"" understood that what you don't see is a lot more frightening than actually showing something scary, their film was all anticipation, with no resolution, and we as the audience felt cheated at the end.It's a tricky concept, one that Shyamalan's ""Signs"" also tried to sustain, and almost did, but the alien revealed at the end was a lot more plain than the ones our imaginations envisioned. In terms of keeping us on the edge of our seats ""Cloverfield"" works perfectly, wisely panning away at the most interesting moments (Holy... did we see it? Was that a...? Argh, we want to see more!) up till the end, when we get a glorious long shot of the thing... and it's damn frightening. It could have been even more frightening, but as the US PG-13 answer to Japan's Godzilla, this will do just fine. More than that, in the midst of all other Hollywood blockbusters, ""Cloverfield"" stands out as one of the better ones of the past decade or so.Like ""Blair Witch..."", the whole film is based on 'found footage' in what used to be Central Park, NYC. The first twenty minutes is all build-up, and for those who complained that the characters are shallow and self-absorbed, well tough, welcome to the real world. Have you been to college recently? Plus, this film is all about the idea that it's found DV footage, and as that it works brilliantly - it puts aside such strained necessities as character development, as well as the origins of the monster (which makes it more enthralling). All the actors (young unknowns, which adds to the effect) are ultra-realistic. I especially liked the inter-cut previously recorded footage of the main character and his girlfriend having a romantic time, which keeps coming in as a shocking contrast to the current horrific events.So everyone's partying at this dude's good-bye party, and then - boom! - all goes to hell. From then on it's pretty much non-stop action, and from the Brooklyn-Bridge destruction sequence, to the subway-tunnel chase (was there a more effective use of night-vision recently?), director Reeves knows exactly what buttons to push, and when to push them.Sure the film is not without its flaws. Some dialogue feels forced and scripted (though not much), some events a bit too coincidental, some of the things the characters survive make you scratch your heads in disbelief...But it's rare nowadays that a Hollywood monster blockbuster even aspires to be artistic (Batman Begins comes to mind). It's especially rare for a Hollywood monster flick to have such immediacy: certain shots from ""Cloverfield"" - a lone horse in the midde of Manhattan; a dark skyscraper leaning against another, the city burning in the back - are quietly devastating, alluding to our post-9/11 fears, our worst nightmares of an unknown terror. Oh, and there's that one helicopter-scene... But you have to see it for yourself...""Cloverfield"" made me smile. Here's a film that took some risks, and is exhilirating based purely on that - the originality is like a breath of fresh air, in an industry chocked up with clone-like mega-budget stinkers (hello, Michael Bay).

One word says it all: AWFUL. I'll tell you why. Yes, it is about these 5 young people who have to survive in Manhattan after a very BIG monster invades the city. Godzilla comes to mind, without the trademark screech. But in Cloverfield the monster comes suddenly out of nowhere and it is hellbent on destroying buildings, so about the only thing the 5 main characters have to do is scream, run, shout, cry, scream, run run run, scream, cry, and argue about which direction to take next. That is what passes off as ACTING in this sorry movie. Thus, there is no real PLOT. The actors just scream and run. Where did the beast come from? They don't say. What does it want? They don't say. What's the plan? They don't say. Heck, the actors are so bland and unidimensional that we really don't care if all of them DIE in the movie!  The ONE saving grace is that the special effects are good.

The shaky camera work is often dizzying,but once you get used to it,you're swept into the narrative.Rob is having a going-away party before heading to Japan for a new job. He has his friend Hud record everything. Hud is interested in Marlena,who's too intoxicated to care. Rob already has a girlfriend,Lily (she speaks of ""becoming part of his family""),while there's Beth,who has a boyfriend,Travis. There's a slow exposition that it turns out Rob&Beth; have cheated on their significant others-with each other-in a one-night stand&a; day at Coney Island. For awhile,it seems like a normal yuppie party,but it takes a turn for the worse with an earthquake.The rest of the film is spent in a suspenseful escape from the monster (and Rob's doomed rescue of Beth) There are parasitic spiders attacking women,causing chest-bursters that remain frighteningly unseen. It's suspenseful and terrifying. Hurricane Katrina is alluded to with a mass exodus from Manhattan as well as looters.The ending is bittersweet&tragic;,juxtaposing Rob&Beth;'s final showdown with the monster with happier times.""Cloverfield"" shows JJ Abrams making a comeback of sorts.

Personally, I feel that both of these aspects of the film are distinct and intelligent choices. As such, they don't interest me much.Are they well executed? Yes. Does everything work flawlessly? No. On the whole, if you shut your brain off - and you can stomach the camerawork -, is the film good? Yes.Now, I have a different and more fundamental gripe with this movie. It boils down to this. The filmmakers think they're smart... but they're not. This is something of a bold -- and loaded -- statement so herein lies my essential argument:'The Blair Witch Project' for all of its fault is a near-perfect 'found footage narrative.' From the text at the beginning, we learn that three filmmakers went into the woods to film a project about the Blair Witch. A year later their footage was found. The film then asks the viewer to 'participate' in the movie. We play the role of an individual who 'watches' the Blair Witch footage.It's not tough, I know -- we're doing it anyway -- but it is a critical aspect of our enjoyment. We're supposed to both actually 'be' and 'play' curious. We buy in that the events could be real... that the film could be a real documentary... and that is what makes the movie scary.'Cloverfield' is the same sort of movie but it doesn't understand what that requires. It asks us to 'play' the role of a viewer of this found footage but never bothers to explain WHY we're viewing it.Now, before you get up in my grill, allow me to point out that CONTEXTUALLY, in the movie, we know that dozens of news broadcasts from New York were going out live. Hundreds of people had cameras filming the event.If we lived in this world -- which the movie asks us to pretend that we do -- we would ask ourselves 'WHY?' before choosing to view this film. Why am I watching this one tape about the monster as opposed to all of the other tapes I could be watching?Why THIS one?You see, unlike living in a post-Blair Witch world, a post-Cloverfield Event world is radically unlike our own. Just as with 9-11, which this film heavily references visually and narratively, a new vocabulary and a new world view would have rapidly been established by the survivors.Facts would be known. We would shorthand certain things.Just as with a new 9-11 doc or a new JFK doc or a new moon landing doc, a post-Cloverfield event viewer would compare and contrast THIS footage with every other 'Cloverfield' video that existed. For us to actually want to watch it, this footage would need to justify itself with a new spin or a new angle to compete in the marketplace.This film doesn't. In fact, it doesn't even try. Worse, I'm pretty sure they never even realized that, yeah, maybe they ought to try.So, in conclusion --These guys think they're smart -- which is always worse than knowing you're dumb.",3,Intriguing yet ultimately flawed film,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,3023,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'engage', 'intellectual', 'analysis', ""'Cloverfield"", 'viewing', 'experience', 'STOP', 'HERE.Everyone', 'something', 'say', 'shaky', 'camera', 'style', 'somewhat', 'unlikeable', 'protagonists', 'populate', 'film', 'Personally', 'feel', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'distinct', 'intelligent', 'choices', 'such', 'do', ""n't"", 'interest', 'much.Are', 'well', 'executed', 'Yes', 'Does', 'everything', 'work', 'flawlessly', 'No', 'whole', 'shut', 'brain', 'can', 'stomach', 'camerawork', 'film', 'good', 'Yes.Now', 'have', 'different', 'more', 'fundamental', 'gripe', 'movie', 'down', 'filmmakers', 'think', ""'re"", 'smart', ""'re"", 'not', 'something', 'bold', 'loaded', 'statement', 'so', 'herein', 'lies', 'essential', 'argument', ""'The"", 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'fault', 'near-perfect', ""'found"", 'footage', 'narrative', 'text', 'beginning', 'learn', 'three', 'filmmakers', 'went', 'woods', 'film', 'project', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'year', 'later', 'footage', 'was', 'found', 'film', 'then', 'viewer', ""'participate"", 'movie', 'play', 'role', 'individual', 'who', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'footage.It', 'not', 'tough', 'know', ""'re"", 'doing', 'anyway', 'critical', 'aspect', 'enjoyment', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'actually', ""'play"", 'curious', 'buy', 'events', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'documentary', 'movie', 'scary', 'same', 'sort', 'movie', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', ""'play"", 'role', 'viewer', 'found', 'footage', 'never', 'bothers', 'explain', 'WHY', ""'re"", 'viewing', 'it.Now', 'get', 'up', 'grill', 'allow', 'point', 'out', 'CONTEXTUALLY', 'movie', 'know', 'dozens', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'New', 'York', 'were', 'going', 'out', 'live', 'Hundreds', 'people', 'had', 'cameras', 'filming', 'event.If', 'lived', 'world', 'movie', 'pretend', 'do', 'would', 'ask', 'choosing', 'view', 'film', 'Why', 'am', 'watching', 'one', 'tape', 'monster', 'opposed', 'other', 'tapes', 'could', 'be', 'watching', 'Why', 'THIS', 'one', 'see', 'living', 'post-Blair', 'Witch', 'world', 'post-Cloverfield', 'Event', 'world', 'radically', 'own', 'Just', '9-11', 'film', 'heavily', 'visually', 'narratively', 'new', 'vocabulary', 'new', 'world', 'view', 'would', 'have', 'rapidly', 'been', 'established', 'survivors.Facts', 'would', 'be', 'known', 'would', 'shorthand', 'certain', 'things.Just', 'new', '9-11', 'doc', 'new', 'JFK', 'doc', 'new', 'moon', 'landing', 'doc', 'post-Cloverfield', 'event', 'viewer', 'would', 'compare', 'contrast', 'THIS', 'footage', 'other', 'video', 'existed', 'actually', 'want', 'watch', 'footage', 'would', 'need', 'justify', 'new', 'spin', 'new', 'angle', 'compete', 'marketplace.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'fact', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'Worse', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'never', 'even', 'realized', 'yeah', 'maybe', 'ought', 'try.So', 'conclusion', 'guys', 'think', ""'re"", 'smart', 'always', 'worse', 'knowing', ""'re"", 'dumb']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

It lacked the campy, almost naive goofiness of the Japanese Godzilla/monster movies that made them so fun, but lacked the intelligence to serve as a metaphor for the potential and actual disaster that face a modern society (could we through in any more allusions to 9/11 in 1 film?!).This film is told from the first person perspective (by showing the story through the lens of a handheld camera).  Unfortunately, this narrative technique greatly reduces the scope of the film to a small slice of a gigantic event.  It's like being served a pepperoni instead of the pizza.  I think War of the Worlds, to a certain degree, also suffered many of the same problems that Cloverfield suffers.  What is the point of a monster movie, except to see mayhem on a massive scale: gigantic monsters; loving shots of modern weapondry in action; large crowds of people squished underfoot.  Instead, we get a jittery, limited view of some potential coolness, and get left with the feeling that ridiculous New York film school technique prevailed over giving the audience what they want.The appealingness of focusing only on a few people in a Godzilla style movie rests solely on how interesting those few people are.  What do we get?  Four or five annoying twenty/thirty somethings who we already learn to hate after having to watch them whine, bitch, and connive about their lame personal lives for twenty minutes.  I forget the name of the character who holds the camera throughout most of the movie, but I actually clapped and cheered when the monster eats him at the end because he was so impossibly annoying.  With buildings blowing up and collapsing, breaking news casts, and people covered in soot and dust, Cloverfield clumsily tries to equate the situation of these 5 losers to New Yorkers during the 9/11 attacks.  I won't launch into a long diatrab about it - suffice it to say that this attempt to evoke the terror and confused of 9/11 utterly fails for a varity of reasons.There are a few things that are good about Cloverfield.  Special effects are done well (though the design of the monster is absolutely pathetic in my opinion), and there is some decent scenes of destruction and mayhem.  Other then that, the only reason to watch this movie is to cheer when the camera man gets eaten at the end.",3,"Oh, if only it were Godzilla",1234656000,"02 15, 2009",2009,2348,"['Cloverfield', 'was', 'immense', 'disappointment', 'lacked', 'campy', 'almost', 'naive', 'goofiness', 'Japanese', 'Godzilla/monster', 'movies', 'made', 'so', 'fun', 'lacked', 'intelligence', 'serve', 'metaphor', 'potential', 'actual', 'disaster', 'face', 'modern', 'society', 'could', 'more', 'allusions', '9/11', '1', 'film', '.This', 'film', 'told', 'first', 'person', 'perspective', 'showing', 'story', 'lens', 'handheld', 'camera', 'Unfortunately', 'narrative', 'technique', 'greatly', 'scope', 'film', 'small', 'slice', 'gigantic', 'event', 'being', 'served', 'pepperoni', 'instead', 'pizza', 'think', 'War', 'Worlds', 'certain', 'degree', 'also', 'suffered', 'many', 'same', 'problems', 'Cloverfield', 'suffers', 'What', 'point', 'monster', 'movie', 'see', 'mayhem', 'massive', 'scale', 'gigantic', 'monsters', 'loving', 'shots', 'modern', 'weapondry', 'action', 'large', 'crowds', 'people', 'squished', 'underfoot', 'Instead', 'get', 'jittery', 'limited', 'view', 'potential', 'coolness', 'get', 'left', 'feeling', 'ridiculous', 'New', 'York', 'film', 'school', 'technique', 'prevailed', 'giving', 'audience', 'what', 'want.The', 'appealingness', 'focusing', 'only', 'few', 'people', 'Godzilla', 'style', 'movie', 'solely', 'how', 'interesting', 'few', 'people', 'are', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'Four', 'five', 'annoying', 'twenty/thirty', 'somethings', 'who', 'already', 'learn', 'hate', 'having', 'watch', 'whine', 'bitch', 'connive', 'lame', 'personal', 'lives', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'forget', 'name', 'character', 'who', 'camera', 'most', 'movie', 'actually', 'clapped', 'cheered', 'when', 'monster', 'end', 'was', 'so', 'impossibly', 'annoying', 'buildings', 'blowing', 'up', 'collapsing', 'breaking', 'news', 'casts', 'people', 'covered', 'soot', 'dust', 'Cloverfield', 'clumsily', 'equate', 'situation', '5', 'losers', 'New', 'Yorkers', '9/11', 'attacks', 'wo', ""n't"", 'launch', 'long', 'diatrab', 'suffice', 'say', 'attempt', 'evoke', 'terror', 'confused', '9/11', 'utterly', 'fails', 'varity', 'reasons.There', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'good', 'Cloverfield', 'Special', 'effects', 'are', 'done', 'well', 'design', 'monster', 'absolutely', 'pathetic', 'opinion', 'decent', 'scenes', 'destruction', 'mayhem', 'Other', 'then', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'cheer', 'when', 'camera', 'man', 'eaten', 'end']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

658623,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B00005JPXY,amerdale876,"[32, 53]","I remember it well. Walking into the movie theater in summer of 1999 with friends and being so excited about seeing a little indie movie calledThe Blair Witch Project. When I had seen the trailer I thought how cool the concept was: to show a movie from a video camcorder perspective (so we're there with the frightened documenters). Well, that was the only cool thing about that movie. The story, character development and direction were the worst thing I had ever seen. I remember the movie ending and feeling cheated as well as if I had just lost 86 minutes of my life I could have been seeing something much better. ""Blair Witch"" was also a joke to me because I had been camping in those same woods (in Burkittsville, MD) as a younger kid and there definitely was no spirit or ghost or killer there. And then the one good thing that came out of the ""Blair Witch"" movie faded back into obscurity: the cool idea that a movie be shot from a character's perspective a la typical video camcorder.Then came J.J. Abrams (creator and producer genius of shows like ""Felicity,"" ""Alias,"" and ""Lost""). While visiting in Japan promoting his movie directorial debut ""Mission: Impossible III,"" with his son, he saw Godzilla toys and thought that America should have its own version of the infamous radiated lizard. He contacted his crew at his production company Bad Robot. They in turn hired writer extraordinare Drew Goddard (who's written TV episodes of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" ""Angel,"" and ""Alias"") and director Matt Reeves (who's only directed the David Schwimmer sleeper ""The Pallbearer"" and a few episodes of ""Felicity,"" which he co-created with Abrams). I knew with Reeves, Goddard and Abrams involved that they would bring to their latest project -- entitled ""Cloverfield"" (named after the street near Abrams' office) or ""01-18-08"" (the movie didn't have an official title; even when the teaser trailer was shown before ""Transformers"") -- what was sorely missing in ""Blair Witch."" They were going to emotionally invest in the characters and have the audience feel close to the main characters with screen time.Like most trends, they hired a cast of unknowns or up-and-comers that hardly anyone has heard of: Lizzy Caplan (Mean Girls), Mike Vogel (2003'sThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Jessica Lucas (ABC's cancelledLife As We Know It), Odette Yustman (ABC'sOctober Road), the wonderful new comedian T.J. Miller (ABC's ""Carpoolers""), and excellent leading man Michael Stahl-David (NBC's cancelledThe Black Donnellys). The producers and writers did well with imbuing this film with palpable characters who remind us of ourselves and people we know. Each character in this movie has their own story (and relationship) which is introduced creatively well in the beginning by recordings (thanks to Miller's everyman character Hud) of each character's interaction at a going-away party for Rob (Stahl-David). Also, interspersed throughout the tape -- when the current party/disaster recording is turned off -- the audience sees previously recorded footage of Rob and his love interest Beth (Yustman) on a special day together. Just when you think the movie is going to continue with these relationships, then all hell unexpectedly breaks loose.The brilliance of this movie is its ""Blair Witch concept"" of showing the film as if it were merely found film footage (no credits at the beginning, only in the end). Of course, this film is on a much bigger scale than ""Blair Witch,"" with a monster terrorizing Manhattan. And while that seems unrealistic, it's the only unrealistic thing about this movie. What the characters do and say, the way the movie plays out is completely realistic. Unlike ""Blair Witch,"" even when there are no attacks or action sequences, ""Cloverfield"" keeps your eyes peeled to the screen; out of the entire packed audience I saw this film with, no one said a word, cracked a joke or even got up to go the bathroom. This movie is everything a disaster movie should be! A thrilling ride of adrenaline and a heart-wrenching story of survival and human emotion, ""Cloverfield"" strikes all the right chords from fright to bravery to even humor. It shows the horror of the event from the point of view of the common man on the ground who's merely trying to survive the catastrophe. LikeJaws(with the shark, throughout most of the movie) and the original theatrical release ofThe Empire Strikes Back(with the Wampa in the ice cave), where the ""monsters"" are not seen for a long time during their screen time, this movie uses that same approach of not showing the monster in its entirety or at all. And that works extremely well for building up the terror for the audience. I won't tell you what the monster looks like when you finally do see it, but I will say it looks nothing likeGodzillaor any interpretation of it. Of course, there also has to be another monstrous threat and it comes in the form of what I can only imagine are the equivalent of ""fleas"" for the monster, but are our size and have very big jaws and teeth. When these monsters are introduced to the lead characters (and thus to the audience), it matches the same terrifying, pulse-pounding moment inAlienswhen Bill Paxton's character holds up the alien locater and sees that the aliens have completely surrounded them in the tunnel and are soon going to attack.""Cloverfield"" was a wonderful monster/catastrophe film and I could easily see it at least three more times in the theater ... if not more. Kudos to Abrams, Reeves, Goddard and crew who pulled off a groundbreaking new form of cinema that the folks attached to ""Blair Witch"" tried desperately to achieve, but painfully failed. The detail that went into the effects as well as the camerawork (some done by actor Miller himself) was so flawlessly executed that I felt as if I were immersed in watching an actual documetary. I'm sure plenty of knock-off straight-to-DVD movies will soon be surfacing with Cloverfield's success, but none will even come close. Everything works with ""Cloverfield"": the story, the acting, the character development, and the direction. If this seems like the kind of movie you're in to but still aren't sure about it, go see it without hesitation! I'm sure there won't be another like it that's this good in a very long time. I've never been so wowed by a movie of this genre and can't recommend it enough. SEE IT! However, there is one caution I must tell you: You'll leave the theater wanting more. More information about the characters, more follow-up, more movie (director Reeves even hinted at looking closely at the background at the very end of the movie for something in the Coney Island scene and staying until the very end of the credits for a voice clip from a radio transmission)! This movie is phenomenal! Like me, most viewers will want to see ""Cloverfield"" over and over again. And that's a true mark of any film's success.And for those skeptical that this DVD release will be what studios did for the DVD release of ""Zodiac"" and other blockbusters in the past -- releasing a regular version with no special features one month, then only to re-release a DVD loaded with special features 6-7 months later (this is referred to as ""double-dipping"") -- the special features for the upcoming DVD release of ""Cloverfield"" have been revealed by Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment as of March 18. Now let's just hope they go with some better, more cooler packaging than the stupid poster art; something that fits the style of the movie (I want a ""top secret"" government slip case and package to make it look like it's an actual piece of government evidence). Here are the special features:* Commentary: Commentary by Director Matt Reeves* Featurette: The Making of Cloverfield* Featurette: Cloverfield Visual Effects* Featurette: I Saw It! It's Alive! It's Huge* Featurette: Clover Fun* Additional Scenes: Congrats Rob* Additional Scenes: When You're in Japan* Additional Scenes: I Call That a Date* Additional Scenes: It's Going to Hurt* Additional

I know what you are thinking.  `He's crazy.'  Maybe I am, but the truth of the matter is (and I've stated I rate each film according to genre as well as overall entertainment and artistic value) that for the type of film `Cloverfield' is, and for the type of film it makes claim to be, there really isn't much more you could ask from it.I mean, honestly; what isn't right about this picture?The film is crazy suspenseful, action packed, gripping, witty, enthralling, memorable; I mean I can't think of a single thing that I would have changed.  The script may be a little cookie cutter but the execution is fresh and intriguing and adds layers that aren't there on paper.  Visually it is superb, using the very underused `less is more' tactic in order to create true suspense and fear; and when it does insert CGI in order to give us some brief glimpses of this `creature' in order to validate our fear it is top notch.  Casting a group of unknowns adds to the feeling of reality that sets in, which only increases the fear.I mean, really; watch this movie in the dark and tell me you weren't pulling your feet up on the couch and checking behind you at every creak in your house.The concept is simple; a group of friends get together to wish one of their own a bon voyage when the city is attacked by some creature and they are scattered.  They travel together with a handheld camera through the city to rescue a friend who is injured and wind up documenting something unbelievable.A little side note for those of you who have either complained about the shaky camcorder style filming or are biting at the bit to do so; DON'T.  Listen, I understand you don't want to get sick or whatever, but the camcorder filming is the whole point of this movie.  If you know that that type of filming doesn't bode well with you then don't bother watching this movie.  Seriously, to complain about a directorial choice that is more than explained to you in the trailer for the film and that serves as the whole foundation for the film is rather ridiculous.  This movie, stripped of that shaky frame, would not be the same film.  It is meant to pull you in to the action and make you feel a part of it, and it does that very thing.Anyways.I admit, this isn't a thought provoking drama or a brooding character study, but it isn't trying to be.  Sure, sci-fi or even horror films are allowed to stray into deeper territories and I encourage that wholeheartedly, but for a film that claims to be nothing more than a sci-fi thriller I can't fault it a thing.  It is what it says it is, and it is really, really good at what it says it does.",5,Time for some shock therapy people...,1235692800,"02 27, 2009",2009,2758,"['WAKE', 'UP', 'Just', 'case', 'were', 'sleeping', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'gave', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'Yep', 'right', 'gave', 'Cloverfield', 'A.', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'crazy', 'Maybe', 'am', 'truth', 'matter', ""'ve"", 'stated', 'rate', 'film', 'according', 'genre', 'as', 'well', 'overall', 'entertainment', 'artistic', 'value', 'type', 'film', 'Cloverfield', 'type', 'film', 'claim', 'be', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'could', 'ask', 'it.I', 'mean', 'honestly', 'what', ""n't"", 'right', 'picture', 'film', 'crazy', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'packed', 'gripping', 'witty', 'enthralling', 'memorable', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'single', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'script', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'execution', 'fresh', 'intriguing', 'layers', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'paper', 'Visually', 'superb', 'using', 'very', 'underused', 'less', 'more', 'tactic', 'order', 'create', 'true', 'suspense', 'fear', 'when', 'insert', 'CGI', 'order', 'give', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'creature', 'order', 'validate', 'fear', 'top', 'notch', 'Casting', 'group', 'unknowns', 'feeling', 'reality', 'only', 'fear.I', 'mean', 'really', 'watch', 'movie', 'dark', 'tell', 'were', ""n't"", 'pulling', 'feet', 'up', 'couch', 'checking', 'creak', 'house.The', 'concept', 'simple', 'group', 'friends', 'get', 'together', 'wish', 'one', 'own', 'bon', 'voyage', 'when', 'city', 'attacked', 'creature', 'are', 'scattered', 'travel', 'together', 'handheld', 'camera', 'city', 'rescue', 'friend', 'who', 'injured', 'wind', 'up', 'documenting', 'something', 'unbelievable.A', 'little', 'side', 'note', 'who', 'have', 'complained', 'shaky', 'camcorder', 'style', 'filming', 'are', 'biting', 'bit', 'do', 'so', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'Listen', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'sick', 'whatever', 'camcorder', 'filming', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'know', 'type', 'filming', ""n't"", 'bode', 'well', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watching', 'movie', 'Seriously', 'complain', 'directorial', 'choice', 'more', 'explained', 'trailer', 'film', 'whole', 'foundation', 'film', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'stripped', 'shaky', 'frame', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'film', 'meant', 'pull', 'action', 'make', 'feel', 'part', 'very', 'thing.Anyways.I', 'admit', ""n't"", 'thought', 'provoking', 'drama', 'brooding', 'character', 'study', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'Sure', 'sci-fi', 'even', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'allowed', 'stray', 'deeper', 'territories', 'encourage', 'wholeheartedly', 'film', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'thing', 'what', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'what']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

It really made the film come across on a more personal level, yet it wasn't excessive.The creatures were truly terrifying and realistic. I hope that the Academy will recognize this with some sort of SFX award come Oscar season.The acting was what really impressed me, though. Unlike normal movies where the cast pretends the camera isn't there, these actors recognized the camera, and came across as real people in that situation. Very impressive ensemble.I know a lot of people hated it, particularly the way it ended.

It is definitely not cute to watch all these hideously boring twenty-somethings gossip about each other and play the ""who's sleeping with whom"" game and act as if it's the most profound thing anyone could imagine.The party which opens the movie is a total bore and so are ALL the characters, most notably the dullard who plays Hud the accidental videographer who records the whole stinking movie on a handicam, very jerkily and with his snide comments and ridiculous rantings heard endlessly on voiceover.It was a somewhat clever idea to put unknowns into the heart of the action without any explanation about this dinosaur-like monster who is invading Manhattan, but it doesn't add up to a sense of terror or show any uplifting aspects of any of the characters.The one attempt at selflessness is instead foolishness and completely unbelievable. Rob gets a cell phone message from the girlfriend he's abandoned and who showed up at his party with an alternate date to spite him. Rob then defies all logic and heads back toward where Beth is apparently dying, just to prove he is, after all, a good guy who doesn't desert his ex-lovers.It's just so much hogwash that viewers need a dose of mouthwash afterwards just to keep the bile from spilling over.This movie shoud get NO stars, but there is some risk involved in making this kind of asinine nonsense and some of the special effects were reasonably good, but if you're looking for an ""arty"" or ""thinking person's"" horror or sci-fi, you'd be better off taking a nap and waiting for a daydream and avoiding this nightmare of a production.",2,Take a nap instead,1211155200,"05 19, 2008",2008,1724,"['Cloverfield', 'attempt', 'be', 'either', 'cute', 'profound', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'eventually', 'definitely', 'not', 'cute', 'watch', 'hideously', 'boring', 'twenty-somethings', 'gossip', 'other', 'play', 'who', 'sleeping', 'whom', 'game', 'act', 'most', 'profound', 'thing', 'anyone', 'could', 'imagine.The', 'party', 'movie', 'total', 'bore', 'so', 'are', 'characters', 'most', 'notably', 'dullard', 'who', 'Hud', 'accidental', 'videographer', 'who', 'whole', 'stinking', 'movie', 'handicam', 'very', 'jerkily', 'snide', 'comments', 'ridiculous', 'rantings', 'heard', 'endlessly', 'voiceover.It', 'was', 'somewhat', 'clever', 'idea', 'put', 'unknowns', 'heart', 'action', 'explanation', 'dinosaur-like', 'monster', 'who', 'invading', 'Manhattan', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'sense', 'terror', 'show', 'uplifting', 'aspects', 'characters.The', 'one', 'attempt', 'selflessness', 'instead', 'foolishness', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'Rob', 'cell', 'phone', 'message', 'girlfriend', 'abandoned', 'who', 'showed', 'up', 'party', 'alternate', 'date', 'spite', 'Rob', 'then', 'logic', 'heads', 'back', 'where', 'Beth', 'apparently', 'dying', 'just', 'prove', 'good', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'desert', 'ex-lovers.It', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'hogwash', 'viewers', 'need', 'dose', 'mouthwash', 'afterwards', 'just', 'keep', 'bile', 'spilling', 'over.This', 'movie', 'shoud', 'get', 'NO', 'stars', 'risk', 'involved', 'making', 'kind', 'asinine', 'nonsense', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'reasonably', 'good', ""'re"", 'looking', 'arty', 'thinking', 'person', 'horror', 'sci-fi', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'taking', 'nap', 'waiting', 'daydream', 'avoiding', 'nightmare', 'production']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

All CLOVERFIELD does is take the ""found"" amateur video to a high tech level, with some impressive visual results, but not enough investment on the viewers behalf. Whereas one could almost believe the mythology of BLAIR WITCH as something that might have really happened, we all know the major event that is depicted in CLOVERFIELD never happened and it was only a movie.  So, why not make it a movie. The shaky hand-held camera is highly distracting for the most part (do not see this movie in a theater if you are susceptible to motion sickness!) and does not allow for the full enjoyment of the special effects. In one of the special features on the disc, one of the film-makers notes the enduring status of the Godzilla monster in Japan and suggests that Americans need their own monster hero.  I submit that Clover is not it based on this movie.  Unlike Godzilla of the Japanese films, the character and origins of Clover is not established enough to make it notable. Perhaps this can be done in another Clover movie, or better yet a remake of this one without the visually annoying hand-held cameras.

Blair Witch Project style filming of a gigantic monster that wrecks havoc on New York City (Godzilla strikes NYC).  Cloverfield is the government name for the incident.  The camcorder is found at some later point and it shows the disaster from the viewpoint of a few ""regular"" people who try to escape and then through various reasons wind up close to the monster.  Somehow these regular people don't put down the camera even under the craziest of circumstances.There was a lot of marketing about this movie and this got me very interested in the film and it reminds me of a set of books I read long ago from Gregory Benford that started with ""The Ocean of Night"" and then progressed on to ""Across the Sea of Suns."" In them there is talk of animal monsters that are flung to earth by some super advanced aliens to keep humanity down.  All through the viral marketing for this movie, I kept thinking that this was an ""adaptation"" or recasting of Benford's fantastic book series -- who knows though, maybe its just a recasting of Godzilla.Regarding the movie:What I loved:a) The concept -- there is just so much that goes untold that just makes us wonder what this thing is, where it came from, the parasites or baby creatures.  Is this an invasion from space?  Are the creatures sent by some super advanced race to attack us (ala Benford's Across the Sea of Suns)? Is it the product of pollution? evolution? engineering by humans (oh dear god, no not another movie of pollution gives breed to monster)?  Please let it be Benford's vision.b) The fact that they left enough open for us to speculatec) The fact that there is so much left to make a sequel aboutd) The acting came across as realWhat I hated:a) Jerky filming - this is ala blair witch but gosh everything is jerky the entire movie.  Starts off slow and then jerky jerky jerky jerky -- gosh.b) The sometimes silly things that were done by characters....like going towards a gigantic monster that is wrecking havoc in NYC (I'd be running away - always away)b) So little is told, that this movie lives in my imagination more than in the filmc) if they make a sequel and they tell us more, they're going to displease some of us when the monster turns out to be some creation of a polluted world or something that gets awakened when the polar ice caps melt -- etc.Overall:a) if you love sci fi - watch this, you'll likeb) if you're a regular person - stay away, you'll hatec) if you like monster flicks - watch, you'll liked) if you hate jerky reality filming - stay away, you'll hateOverall, to me this was just a giant advertisement for a 300millon dollar summer blockbuster sequel if they do it right (but please no more shaky single camera filming) -- give me a story, and infocus special effects --- give me Benford's world!

Very clever plot and script that never overstays its welcome, I think it clocks in at a little over 70 minutes, which feels right for this. I love the lack of back story too, if this really happened, no one would know where it came from as it was unfolding!  And the unknown cast worked well for this movie as well.  The computer generated effects are absolutely stunning, I've never seen better.  And unlike the creatures in The Mist, the monsters here are well thought out and rendered.  Very cool that the monster is rarely shown, but not bogus as you do get several good shots of it.  I did have some problems with it, if I was to get picky.  I'm pretty sure the scale of the monster changes by several hundred feet, depending on what shot it is in.

658645,A2L05U5DC0SW56,B00005JPXY,"B. Gorman ""1138""","[1, 4]","Ever since I was about 4, I have been a diehard fan of giant monster movies. Godzilla, of course, was my favorite. I have fond memories of going to Hastings to rent another monster movie almost each week. As I grew older, my appreciation never ceased, but I began to long for a big-budget American monster movie. My wish kind of came true.That ""wish come true"" came in the form of Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich'sGodzillastarring Matthew Broderick. Yes, the movie was a multi-million dollar American film. Yes, the main monster was Godzilla. No, it wasn't very good at all. Godzilla (or GINO) wasn't about an almost-indestructible monster wreaking havoc in New York and striking fear into the hearts of horrified victims. It was an over-sized lizard that just wanted to be left alone, so it could lay its eggs. As a film by itself, it was okay, but as a ""Godzilla movie"", it was an insult.After that, no one in America even TRIED to touch a monster movie. It was left to the Japanese again, as well as Korea who began to experiment on the genre, to make the monster movies. Over the next decade, many good and succesful (and bad and unsuccesful) monster movies were released, such asGodzilla 2000,Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah - Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, Godzilla's 50th Anniversary filmGodzilla - Final Wars, the recent Korean filmDragon Wars, and the much-more-succesfulThe Host. With newly-growing interest in the U.S. (and even an American theatrical run of Dragon Wars), the time was ripe for another attempt in the U.S.It started with a trailer attached to the new live-action Transformers film. The trailer showed the general skeleton of the beginning of the film and did not reveal its name, only saying that it was a new film from J.J. Abrams and ""1-18-08"". Many viral sites and further speculation of what the title could be quickly brought the hype to unbelievable heights. But one thing was certain: it was the first giant monster movie to be made in America in 10 years and that was reason to see no matter what the title.""Cloverfield"" is finally here and this is what I thought about it:***SPOILER WARNING***First off, one of the biggest aspects is the fact that the entire movie is shown through a standard home video camera. I would like to say that I have never seen ""The Blair Witch Project"", so I wasn't distracted by comparing the two, like many others seemed to have been. Those that may not have enjoyed The Bourne Ultimatum's shaky camera will hate this move. I went to see this with two friends and one was fine, but the other got nauseated and left the theater even before the 1/3 mark. This didn't bother me too much, having a very strong stomach, but after a while, even I felt a little weird. So those of you who have weak stomachs, at least wait until it comes out on DVD.The next aspect I want to point out is (what else) the monster. Now this is the reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars. Through most of the movie, the monster remains hidden and when his full profile does show up, blink and you'll miss it. When a few good shots finally showed the full monster, I kind of wished it had stayed hidden. I didn't think it looked very imposing, as I thought it would at first. To counter some of those rumors that the monster was an enourmous walking whale, they were WAY off. The monster is basically a giant spider monkey with no fur, gills and a reptillian tail. It did, however, remind me of some of the more outlandish Japanese inventions from back in the day, so maybe that's what Abrams was shooting for. Much more frightening though, were the creature's offspring. It was these that brought all of the horror aspects to the movie. They were much more spider-like than the giant ""queen"" and for some reason reminded me of Shelob from the ""Lord of the Rings"". Their reproductive system also reminded me of the horror film ""Alien"".Next up, the plot...okay so maybe there isn't much to it. A guy by the name of Rob gets a surprise going away party the night before he leaves to go to Japan. The party is crashed, however, by a giant monster that emerges from the ocean and attacks Manhattan. There you go. The fact that there isn't really a plot makes sense, however, since a dude that just happens to have a camcorder isn't going to try to make an all-out epic film with a plot and all around something that is happening at this very moment. The movie really acts like it really happened, complete with a prologue and epilogue saying that this footage is government property and was found in ""former Central Park"". Overall, I think this could serve as a good ""prologue"" film for a much longer possible series. This theory is better supported after the credits, with a garbled radio transmition that, when said backwards, means ""it's still alive"".LikeGojira / Godzillabefore it, this film simbolizes the fears that the country has recently experienced. Godzilla represented the fears of the nuclear bomb, while ""Cloverfield"" represents the recent 9/11 attack and the fear of another attack. Much of the destruction, I noticed, resembled what was seen on that fateful day, complete with a lot of flying dust and bewildered people lulling around the streets.If you're a fan of monster movies and don't care about shaky cameras, see this movie NOW! It was very much worth the ticket price and I walked out, hoping that ""Cloverfield"" would receive enough praise and money to inspire a sequel (which so far, it's going along the right track).",4,A

Abrams that America deserves a monster, a giant monster, like Godzilla that sticks in the psyche of the American people for generations. Alas, Godzilla, who was the inspiration for Cloverfield has his roots in the horrors of America dropping the Atomic Bomb on 2 cities to win WWII. Godzilla, a monster born from atom bomb testing embodies something that the Japanese will always remember. The origin of the Cloverfield monster is unknown. Is it an inadvertently man-made monster? Is it a monster from the deepest part of the ocean or is it from outer space? Who knows? And while that is a burning question throughout the movie, it is never answered. There are many things that work for the movie, but after awhile they have the opposite effect. I have seen the movie 3 times, including once in the movie theater. Twice I have gotten nauseated from the handheld, bouncy camera work. I get it. Its a Youtube like look at a large scale disaster, parts of which were inspired by 9/11. But the movie goes overboard with the handheld camera movement. This last time I watched it I had to take Tylenol from a headache centered right behind my eyes. And that is my biggest complaint because the movie is well made, with a good storyline and has characters you care about. But the camera work went overboard to emulate what is seen on Youtube news reports. Will there be a sequel, one shot traditionally? I hope so. And how can there not be a sequel, if this is supposted to be America's Godzilla.  I recommend that anyone into Sci-Fi or even horror see the film, it is a scary movie.

658650,A1PEIYVBP09WGU,B00005JPXY,"B. Massey ""George""","[1, 3]","I was very skeptical about Cloverfield. I'm extremely critical of anything new that comes out of Hollywood, especially when it's a story of destruction taking place in New York (Plenty of originality there, eh) I even walked out of 'I am Legend' and got a refund because I've had enough of paying for movies that are worse than popular TV, but I'm glad to say that Cloverfield delivered on its hype. There was a time when movies used to do this often, partly because no CG meant more effort on the script and story, partly because I was about 8 years old, but either way, blockbusters do tend to disappoint. When Cloverfield began I was thinking 'Oh no, this is obviously scripted which takes away from the realism, the editing is far too  precise for it to be be just a guy with a camera and it looks like it's shot on film rather than video' which also bothered me, but none of that matters. There are still things that niggle at me in places, but overall the film eases you in well and when everything kicks off, it's one of the most exciting rides I've experienced in the cinema. I can imagine Cloverfield theme park rides opening up in Universal studios much like the amazing Alien Wars experiences that are apparently still scattered around. There's plenty of imagination and it stuck to the widely known but frequently avoided rule that what you don't see is more interesting than what you do see. See it in the cinema, it's a thrill ride, however the film suffers from a tacked on final few minutes which feels like an alternative/extra ending, and it brings the believability of the film down completely, and left me with a very bitter taste in my mouth because it was just so pointless.

658651,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JPXY,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[6, 7]","It's always nice to see someone in Hollywood take chances and move outside normal filming practices. Although CLOVERFIELD isn't wholly original, it does have an original feel thanks to the incredibly myopic look the audience gets via its length through one camera lens.Labeled asGodzillameetsThe Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield definitely incorporates portions of both but comes out the other end as its own animal.The myopic view was seen, as stated earlier, in The Blair Witch Project, which had a handheld camera being buoyed around by an amateur film maker, allowing the viewer to get up-close and personal with the story. With Cloverfield, we get the same experience but with a bit more high-tech status along the way. New York skyscrapers crumble and explode. The head of lady liberty comes hurtling down the street. The Brooklyn Bridge gets twisted and ripped apart like tissue paper. And the ""monster"" causing all this ...well ...you'll have to see that for yourself. I will say, however, that it was nice to only get glimpses of the creature and its `offspring' since that is the way it would truly happen if viewed through one person's eyes.Which brings us to the Godzilla aspects of the film. Japan has that monster, and J.J. Abrams (Lost) gives us a new American one here. Unique is size, shape, and color, this new beast is just as tough to kill as Godzilla and has many smaller monsters (about the size of a regular dog) that it sheds like lice. And you don't want to get bitten by one of these lice; trust me! The more unique and intriguing thing about this new creature is that we know nothing about it since the story is all coming from one herky-jerky camera lens. Alien? Radioactive giant? Government experiment gone wrong? Who knows. This added to the realism of the story.Although I understand the need for character development, I felt that the opening 20 minutes dragged on a bit too long. The love story between Jason (Mike Vogel,Rumor Has It) and Beth (Odette Yustman,Transformers) added to the story in the end but was overly forced upon us in the beginning (""We get it! They're in love already!"")Two other notable items must be mentioned. The first is the realism of the camera movements and the klutzy guy who carries it named Hudd (comedian T.J. Miller). Although why he continued to carry it sometimes bordered on ludicrous, his dopey demeanor helped make this easier to swallow. The second item is the sound quality. Absolutely amazing! The thumps, bumps, and explosions were an awesome thing to hear, and the dolby digital sound quality really shone through.Certainly something to watch on a big screen TV with a great sound system. This one is sure to please monster movie afficionados.",4,Godzilla Meets The Blair Witch Project?

658652,A1ESUYMIG3TZT0,B00005JPXY,Bobby  W.,"[2, 3]","""Cloverfield"" is a neat take on the giant monster running amuck theme.The film is presented as recovered camcorder footage shot by some unfortunate eyewitnesses.The whole story of how the camcorder got into a certain person's hands and the peripheral  events leading up to the monster's rampage are cleverly done. Out of the small group of people that the film follows, I found myself pulling mainly for the clown behind the camera. Hud's story was the most poignant.Though the movie has many dramatic moments, there's a lot of humor in here, and when the main theme plays during the end credit roll, you get the feeling that they didn't take themselves too seriously, and I think that's why the film works.Most people that slammed this movie had objections to the way it was shot, but I thought the ""Blair Witch"" style of shooting worked well considering how the story is told. The destruction special effects seemed pretty darn realistic.  It was the monster itself that I found kind-of unconvincing.  It reminded me of the Rancor beast that Luke takes on in Star Wars Episode 6 (interestingly enough,  Phil Tippett was involved in both projects).

And that's what you get in Cloverfield, a well-done low-budget movie that shows you don't need $100 million to make a decent movie.  A group of friends at a going-away party, with a video camera, are in Manhattan when a monster shows up.  Part of the genius of Cloverfield is that we don't know where the monster came from, what it's doing or what it wants.  Every other movie of this genre is from the POV of the science guy who figures out how to fight the monster, whether with ""plain ol' sodium!"" (""Horror of Party Beach""), some kind of radio waves, (""Beginning of the End,"" as I recall), or by nuking the site to make sure.  In ""Cloverfield,"" the POV instead is that of the schmucks like us who would be running around wondering what the heck is going on after we find the head of the Statue of Liberty out in the street in front of the house.On the downside, there's a little too much pre-monster time in the movie.  And the video camera is magical - it has enough battery life to run through an entire party and a monster attack, with some left over to run the external light and Night Shot.  Where do I get one of those?

The concept behind the movie is solid...a monster hits NY but rather than show it from the perspective of the laser-gun wielding hero, show how regular folks are affected by the unknown as events unfold.  Unfortunately the ""regular folks"" are terrible.  The movie starts off attempting to establish the characters but alas the characters come across as being one dimensional, for whom I have very little, if any, empathy for.  The dialogue from the camera operator becomes annoying.  And as each character dies there is a pervading sense of ""oh well, no great loss there"".  Quite simply - the concept behind the movie is superb, alas the execution is utterly flawed, and to sum up my impression of the film then it would be ""Terrible"".

But, for my money, that is precisely what director Matt Reeves has achieved with ""Cloverfield."" I was admittedly quite torn about catching this in theaters last January. For every five people in my immediate circle who were praising this film to the high heavens, there were at least the same amount more who claimed it was just as bad as ""The Blair Witch Project."" Much like that film, the camera does tend to shake. But, when you're running for your life while still trying to document everything you're witnessing, that pratfall is ultimately unavoidable. It did not, thankfully, detract me from investing my interest. And, unlike ""Blair Witch,"" I actually had a visual threat in the guise of a truly unique and terrifying creature to react to.That same creature, incidentally, makes its abrupt and unexplained arrival on the very night five young New Yorkers decide to throw a going-away party for one of their own. The first fifteen minutes of the film eases you into these characters, giving you just the right amount of insight into who they are and what they're all about. But, once the head of Lady Liberty comes crashing down the street outside their building, the real thrills begin! This ferocious invader, standing nearly thirty stories high, is certainly a formidable threat in and of itself. But it soon becomes apparent to our protagonists that it is not, by any means, alone. The rampaging monster is host to a multitude of smaller parasitical organisms that drop off from its body and scuttle along the ground like scorpions. One bite from these vicious critters, without giving too much away, would make anybody pray for a bullet.As a lifelong giant monster fan, I had a blast! Roland Emmerich, who ten years ago helmed the ill-received ""Godzilla,"" could easily learn a thing or two from ""Cloverfield."" It was everything that film could and should have been. In terms of overall mood and atmosphere, I would probably rank this right alongside the Japanese classic, ""Gojira."" I admit it may not be everybody's cup of tea, particulary for those who, like me, utterly despised ""Blair Witch."" But there is still much to savor here.Among that, predominantly, is the special effects team. Had I not, for whatever theoretical reason, realized this was a fictional movie I was watching, I would have sworn somebody had captured a genuine monster rampage on their video camera. And, amazingly, despite the fact this whole thing takes place in Manhattan, the vast majority of the film was actually lensed on Paramount's back-lot in Los Angeles! Talk about an illusion! This is why I so rabidly savor all those ""behind-the-scenes"" featurettes most others, my own spouse specifically, take for granted. The DVD may not retain the same lasting impact of the theatrical experience, as most of my peers have already outlined. But, for the uninitiated, it does offer some invaluable insight into what exactly made this the box-office hit it quickly became. This review ultimately represents my own opinion.

The viral marketing was interesting and I really thought this would be an incredible hit. Unfortunately, it just doesn't fly like it should have.Yes, the idea of a movie shot entirely from someone's video camera is a good one...but then you reach those points in the movie when you know there's no way on earth you'd sit there and keep filming while this stuff was going on. Any normal person would drop the camera and run for their lives. And yes, the monster was unique, I'll give points for that. But the point of going to a movie like this is to find out some simple answers: where did the monster come from? Why did it choose New York? What made it attack? These are the questions you START the movie with. They are the same questions you'll END the movie with. The movie ends with such abruptness you'd think the director just said, ""Ok, that's the budget, let's go home.""There are good qualities too. The movie is genuinely suspenseful at times. The jerky camera movements can give you a headache after a while, but it really gives authenticity to the experience. You feel like you're a part of a real disaster occurring around you. Still, the ending just ruins the movie for me. I felt like I'd watched an episode of a great television show, and I'd be hyped for next week's episode...except there isn't one coming.

658664,A3I7YI4NMP6SV8,B00005JPXY,"B. Wells ""CineMan""","[0, 2]","With the advance buildup that ""Cloverfield"" received, the unveiling of the actual product was bound to leave some, if not most, viewers feeling cheated or disappointed to some degree.  For months (it seemed) the trailer teased and tantalized with thrilling, often incomprehensible, images of chaos and destruction in Manhattan, as frantic, attractive twenty-somethings scurried for their lives amidst fiery explosions and the indelible image of the Statue of Liberty's head crashing and rolling to a stop near terrified onlookers.Utilizing the conceit that the entire adventure is caught on a partygoer's camcorder, ""Cloverfield"" immediately conjures up memories of the ""The Blair Witch Project"", that late nineties megahit that seemed to polarize viewers into ""love it"" or ""hate it"" camps.  I liked ""Blair Witch"", although the concept of the student's terrifying journey being captured via their own video cameras was stretched very thin at times, particularly during the meltdown scenes, and those scenes when the students appeared to be in mortal danger.  However, the young people in ""Blair Witch"" were film students so it was possible to go along with the idea of their incessant filming.  With ""Cloverfield"" it's not that simple.  The protagonists here are not apparently film students but regular, young New Yorkers throwing a surprise party for one of their own, a golden boy named Rob, who has accepted a job in Japan.  Since Rob is leaving the next morning, the girlfriend of Rob's brother insists that the entire evening be captured on camera for Rob to savor in the weeks to come.  As everyone now knows, the party is seriously interrupted by something that is big and mean and clearly unhappy.  Lower Manhattan is ripped apart, the Brooklyn Bridge is demolished, Miss Liberty is decapitated, and romances are tested, friends die--and hardly a moment is left unfilmed.  Hud, the assigned cameraman, and Rob's best friend dutifully records every single moment, even as he is running down flights of stairs, jumping from one collapsing building to another, being attacked by some really icky spiderlike entities in a subway tunnel--it just doesn't work.  The only way to make this believable would be for Hud to have the camcorder strapped to his head, but that isn't the case.  I really didn't mind the fast, jerky movements of the camera--for me, it added a sense of urgency and excitement to the film. Most of all, it added much needed intimacy to these characters' plight, since we are seeing this crisis through their eyes, specifically through the eyes of Hud. However, even this does not do much to endear the characters to the viewer.  Actually, I found them to be somewhat uninvolving, at best, and irritating, at worst.  I was especially irritated that Rob would allow his good friends to traipse all the way to 59th Street from downtown with the beast from hell (and his minions) hot on their tail while Rob tries to rescue his almost-girlfriend from another unknown peril.  I was also irritated at the really stupid decisions that these characters continually make throughout the film.  Most of all, I was irritated because I really wanted to like this film and, while it isn't awful, it could have been so much better.  It's sort of like ""Friends"" meets ""Godzilla"", without the character development of either. That's not the fault of the pretty, but little known, actors--they do the best that they can with a lame and predictable script.  The special effects were good, and sometimes even great.  The few glimpses we get of the monster are effectively creepy, but the truly chilling creatures are the aforementioned spidery things which are, apparently, parasites that have attached themselves to the larger beast.  They are fast and deadly and you can't see them coming until they're right on top of you!With J.J. Abrams attached as producer, I (perhaps unfairly)expected ""Cloverfield"" to be a better film.

It is a badly-made ""monster goes berserk in NY"" film.The first 20 minutes is like watching a poorly produced home movie full of partying people you don't know. The conversations are senseless and do nothing to propel the plot forward.The camera shakes, rolls and dips constantly, actually tipping completely sideways several times without reason or obvious cause.  It gets worse when the creature finally makes his appearance. The camera starts making 180-degree dizzying sweeps of the street, always managing to capture people screaming, panicking and looting, but never capturing more than a one-second glimpse of the monster. Only when someone stops to talk on their cell phone does the camera stop shaking for a few minutes.Unlike the Blair Witch Project, which gave birth to the Shaky Camera Realism Syndrome, the viewer never connects with the characters, and therefore really doesn't care what happens to them.Cloverfield is a typical chase-and-run monster flick where the actors do little more than flee from a creature we never see clearly until the last five minutes of the movie. The movie's main purpose is to stimulate chaos by bobbing the camera back and forth, hoping to create realism, but it fails miserably. How does a woman survive being impaled through the chest by a steel rod, yet manage to run down 100 flight of stairs to a waiting helicopter? Probably the same way the helicopter passengers survived a fall from 1000's of feet in the air after the helicopter crashes to the street below. Realism?

658666,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00005JPXY,Caleb Williams,"[4, 6]","We all know of the hype that surrounded this film and that was even before we even knew the name of the film, once we found out the name we became more pre-occupied with the Monster but we never really got to see the monster up close and personal. Even when the movie was released we're never really given a clear shot of the monster itself leaving more to the imagination, which I think makes it all the more special. The story tells of Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) who's about to leave New York city to start a new life in Japan, during his goodbye party he has an argument with his girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman) and she leaves while he has to attend the party with other things on his mind. By about this time the cameraman for the movie is Hud. (T.J. Miller) As the night progresses the party is shaken by an almighty roar for which they suspect may be an earthquake but after a news report we come to learn it's something so much more frightening.There have been many complaints about the concept of the movie being Blair Witch-esque and being shot entirely by a handheld camera, but let me be honest when I say that it makes it all the more realistic and even more frightening. This is definitely a monster movie on the scale of the 1998 Godzilla but with one huge difference... OK maybe two and they are, we know nothing about the monster or where it comes from and we don't really come to know what it looks like. This is definitely big budget and the first scene in which the monster first attacks the city gives us the frightening vibe of the 9/11 attacks and the hysteria that the people felt at that time.If the initial attack and the monster itself wasn't enough to scare the life out of you, then the little creatures that fall off the monster are seriously something to make you wet your pants with fright. They have the cringe factor of a very large spider, they're fast, they're crazy and if they bite you, you explode. We're never given any explanation about what's going on with the monster or the little creatures, we never find out why the people explode and indeed whether something in the Alien movie fashion jumps out. The lack of information we're given is really something that makes the whole film special as the less you know, the more your mind starts to play tricks and the more you start to think ""well maybe this is what happens, or maybe that's it"" you just don't know and that's what makes it an incredible film going experience.This is something that you really should try, don't be put off by the wimpy claims of motion sickness or the pathetic ramblings of not being able to see much and the camera always swerving away from the best bit, as that's the point.

What that means is I liked the acting, the story, and effects, but I wanted to slap someone silly that thought filming it as a everyone has one portable handheld camera so that makes it ""REAL"". I don't like ""The Blair Witch Project"" for the same reason. If I want to watch home movies I can pull my own out. Come to think of it I have never  seen any home movies where it looked like they purposely played catch, drop, and spin with their camera when filming. Even the worst amateurs can do a better job. So sorry the ""amateur"" angle doesn't fly. We don't plop down $9 plus to see it in a theater or $15 plus to get the DVD so we can watch the absolute worst in amateur photography. My wife wouldn't watch after about five minutes as the camera moving all over made her sick to the stomach.I had alot of trouble myself and had to look away regularly even though I wanted to watch. Now as a person that has filmed movies for years, if you want to do this nonsense because ""YOU"" think it's edgy or something please get someone that at least can hold the camera right, any mom or dad off the street namely. They have lots more experience than the camera person in this movie, that or the director told them to make this movie this way so people would hurl alot. So once again I loved the movie, just not how it was filmed. Had they held the camera still more I would have given it four and a half stars. Go to any of the web sites sporting amateur videos and you will see they are filmed far superior to this movie. And they unlike this movie are in fact edgy and cutting edge ideas in camera work. You people voting negative to us that thought the camera work sucked, why have DVD sales been so poor? Even people that are curious because of all the commentary are only renting it. - C.

A satelite/whatever only now disturbing something that huge is implausible,as underwater eartquakes would have disturbed it millenia ago.2. Any earth-based creature breathes either air or water, has either lungs or gils, not both,and the creature from Cloverfield was clearly breathing air,which implies that it would eventually have to surface for oxygen.And something that huge would be nearly impossible to miss once it surfaced.3. There would have to be multiple creatures, for activities like...I don't know...reproduction.Making their presence all the more obvious.4. Not to mention that EVERYTHING that comes from the ocean requires fins, while this creature was clearly walking around on giant legs, a trait common to land creatures.5. An alien origin would nullify any earth-based logic.That being said:The movie's characters are soo believable,and you get so immersed in their initial conflict that you forget you're about to watch a monster flick.The shaky handi-cam adds to the realism, as does the lack of creature footage.You see it, but you only get a vague sense of what it looks like.You do however get a much better sense of what the spider-like flea-creatures that come off the behemoth look like,though again, you only get a vague sense of how their bites work.The character that is bit, is quickly ushered away before you get to see the outcome of the obvious infection.It was a really good monster flick, but it definitely felt incomplete.I know there's gonna be 2 more movies from different angles,and knowing that makes this one seem all the better.But all in all, very enjoyable.MORAL OF THE STORY:The bigger they are, the faster you should run!!",4,FROM WENCE CLOVERFIELD CAME!!!!!,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,2343,"['***', 'IMPORTANT', 'MESSAGE', '***The', 'origin', 'Cloverfield', 'monster', 'indeed', 'hinted', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'main-characters', 'are', 'ferris', 'wheel.Before', 'camera', 'girlfriend', 'shooting', 'ocean', 'horizon', 'look', 'closely', 'television', 'size', 'space-station', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'comet/meteorite/satelite/something', 'crash', 'ocean', 'distance.I', ""'ve"", 'extensively', 'debated', 'point', 'origin', 'space', 'ocean', 'horror', 'forums', 'so', 'far', 'signs', 'could', 'point', 'personally', 'believe', 'came', 'space', 'scientificly', 'ocean', 'wouldnt', 'make', 'sense', 'Here', 'why', 'believe', 'this:1', 'satelite/whatever', 'only', 'now', 'disturbing', 'something', 'huge', 'implausible', 'underwater', 'eartquakes', 'would', 'have', 'disturbed', 'millenia', 'ago.2', 'earth-based', 'creature', 'breathes', 'air', 'water', 'lungs', 'gils', 'not', 'creature', 'Cloverfield', 'was', 'clearly', 'breathing', 'air', 'would', 'eventually', 'have', 'surface', 'oxygen.And', 'something', 'huge', 'would', 'be', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'miss', 'once', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'multiple', 'creatures', 'activities', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'reproduction.Making', 'presence', 'more', 'obvious.4', 'Not', 'mention', 'EVERYTHING', 'ocean', 'fins', 'creature', 'was', 'clearly', 'walking', 'around', 'giant', 'legs', 'trait', 'common', 'land', 'creatures.5', 'alien', 'origin', 'would', 'nullify', 'earth-based', 'logic.That', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'soo', 'believable', 'get', 'so', 'immersed', 'initial', 'conflict', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watch', 'monster', 'flick.The', 'shaky', 'handi-cam', 'realism', 'lack', 'creature', 'footage.You', 'see', 'only', 'get', 'vague', 'sense', 'what', 'like.You', 'do', 'however', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'sense', 'what', 'spider-like', 'flea-creatures', 'come', 'behemoth', 'look', 'though', 'again', 'only', 'get', 'vague', 'sense', 'how', 'work.The', 'character', 'bit', 'quickly', 'ushered', 'away', 'get', 'see', 'outcome', 'obvious', 'infection.It', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'monster', 'flick', 'definitely', 'felt', 'incomplete.I', 'know', 'gon', 'na', 'be', '2', 'more', 'movies', 'different', 'angles', 'knowing', 'one', 'seem', 'better.But', 'very', 'enjoyable.MORAL', 'THE', 'STORY', 'bigger', 'are', 'faster', 'should', 'run']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

For some films that is necessary and important. For a film such as ""Cloverfield"" the more that gets explained the more you take away from your audience and the less they can go home with.This film lets the mind race and wander as to what on earth is actually going on. Since no clear explanation is given, audience members are permitted to speculate and wonder. This film gives just enough info that I felt wholly satisfied, while at the same time leaving enough exposition in the dark as to make me truly feel I was in and amongst the chaos. People that do not like this type of filmmaking should steer clear of this.The visual echos of 9/11 are very obvious. Some people thought they were done in poor taste. I disagree. I think they gave the film more realism. Actually anything less than what we know reality to look like now when large buildings fall would have been criticized as unrealistic. This film was very realistic looking. Also the film spoke to the state of our society, our fears, and our paranoia. The ignorance the film made you feel is the very real ignorance we all have as to what is actually going on in this world and how we feel helpless in the face of many giant disasters, wars, and people of power. This is not political, rather, it's just timely and reactionary. Godzilla was a reaction to the atomic bombs, as were many atomic films of the day. Aliens attacking us are fears we may not be alone and what is out there may be worse than us. recent disaster films are reactions to 9/11 and what the future may hold. Ultimately all these types of disaster films find their roots in very base human fears of man against nature. We know we are insignificant despite all our progress and these types of films speak volumes about that.The comments the characters made in the film were just as stupid and lame brain as the ones the audience members were making in the theater, hence more realism. Real people are not actors and do not act cool in crisis. People react in ways that contradict reason during crisis. Going after a loved one is very realistic. People go back for pets so to track down a girlfriend is not much of a leap. As far as friends following, well... suspension of disbelief may be required. Since I was sitting in the theater trying to accept a giant monster destroying Manhattan...well... accepting a few friends tagging along to rescue some dudes girl was not hard to accept.If you need everything explained, if you don't like shaky camera work, if you hate Godzilla films, and if you thought ""Independence Day"" was great, then stay away from this.

I mean the movie is trying to make the audience feel like its a real disaster going on why not give the characters some common sense too.What bothered me the most is what the characters did. I understand everything is happening so fast and everyone is under stress but just some of the things they do in the movie are just so stupid.I like the blair witch/Godzilla approach to the movie it adds to the suspence and makes you feel like your right there. The only problem is would a person really record all this on a cam corder? Probably not but its a movie so anything goes.The movie is only 113min. long pretty weak after all the hype. I would have liked it to been at least a couple of hours. It takes to long in the beginning and before you know it right when it gets really good its over.The creature is awesome looking and very original. It actually looks scary and very intimidating. The sounds in the movie were really cool and added to the intense moments and all the chaos.This movie really had you on the edge of your seat. It's a good movie but the majority of the bad reveiws is that it ended to soon and were all just mad because we wanted more. lol This movie really feels like your on a theme park ride.

658681,A2XFII4E73279L,B00005JPXY,"Charles Justus Garard ""Charles J. Garard Jr. PhD""","[6, 9]","Of course, reviewers are going to complain about the shaky camcorder photography. Whether or not it made them dizzy or ill depends upon their own sensibilities; perhaps they are the people who become easily car sick or air sick; perhaps on the big screen in a dark theatre the moving images are magnified. I don't know; I viewed it on DVD.Okay. But without the camcorder perspective, what do we have? Another throwback to 1950s post-atomic fallout science-fiction with giant squids, giant octopii, scorpians, locusts, spiders, ants, and preying mantises -- all the result of man's carelessness with nuclear detonations? The story, of course, is nothing: Beth and Rob ""had sex"" (woooooooo -- how old are these people? young sophisticated New York Yuppies or midwestern twelve-year-olds?) No. The story is nothing, but the presentation is everything -- point of view is the central gimmick and existential premise. Versimilitude is all -- the unreal is made to look real.Film scholar Louis D. Giannetti reminded us years ago that each new camera set-up in a motion picture, between or even within shots, presents viewers with a new perspective from which to evaluate what they see. Films, for example, often combine omniscient narration with the first person, and the director may cut directly from first-person subjective point-of-view shots to objective camera angles, from close-ups to gauge reactions of single characters to long shots [UNDERSTAND MOVIES. 2nd ed. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1976].Many films have, through the years, relied heavily on the subjective camera (e.g., LADY IN THE LAKE, 1946) and those FRIDAY THE 13th blood- baths where horny teenages at Crystal Lake are murdered one by one. In Jack Arnold's 3-D film IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, 1953), audiences are given control over the earthlings because the point of view when they confront the aliens is from the aliens' perspective, a device that allows the audience to see the earthlings as victims. The residents of the sleepy desert town of Sand Rock, Arizona, fimd themselves enveloped in the billowing fog that borders the vision of the viewers while they stalk victims from behind the bubble-eye of the aliens.CLOVERFIELD is part of this subjective camera sub-genre. It begins disarmingly enough with a clever, non-horror title -- quite inspired -- not what one would expect for a monster movie like those of the 1950s or the awful Godzilla imports. The tape found in the camcorder is the whole story -- from the beginning when Rob is sneaking up on Beth during the morning-after sequence to the Coney Island close-ups of Beth giggling into the lens -- to the ending when we are back at Coney Island, the part of the tape which was not inadvertently taped over by beginner videographer ""Hud"" (coaxed into taking on videotaping chores by the hero's brother who wants a record of the party which is celebrating the brother's departure to Japan). The ending of the tape is the ending of the film, showing Rob and Beth's idyllic time together before the mayhem -- the tape which has now, according to the beginning of the film, become part of an official government documentation of the events.The New York setting provides understandable echoes of 9-11 -- another terrorist attack, as some of the panicked characters speculate. Fortunately, the cinema verite plot focuses more on the fleeing citizens than on the scientists and military types that we saw in the 1950s, but with 21st century dialogue and profanity. Even one of the military officers looks like an alumnus from the TWIN PEAKS television series, but he is onscreen in only fleeting, hand-held shots. I wonder if he complained to his agent about this. We even see scenes of enterprising thieves breaking into an electronics store and looting it -- an aspect of disasters that, unfortunately, are all too real and commonplace. Even our hero, the Tom Cruise clone, steals a phone in order to call his trapped former girl friend, Beth. As they try to cross the bridge to Brooklyn, the hero's brother is wiped out, along with many others, when the tail of the gigantic creature descends on the historical structure. So much for being an iconoclast -- first the Statue of Liberty is decapitated; then the famous bridge is sawed in half. No respect.CLOVERFIELD may not be the overnight commercial success that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT enjoyed, but it is as least as effective, and the denouement is just as downbeat. Quit whining about the shaking camera and enjoy the experience for what it is supposed to be -- an exercise in verisimilitude.",5,The camcorder is the star; point of view is everything,1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,4584,"['course', 'reviewers', 'are', 'going', 'complain', 'shaky', 'camcorder', 'photography', 'not', 'made', 'dizzy', 'ill', 'own', 'sensibilities', 'perhaps', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'become', 'easily', 'car', 'sick', 'air', 'sick', 'perhaps', 'big', 'screen', 'dark', 'moving', 'images', 'are', 'magnified', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'viewed', 'DVD.Okay', 'camcorder', 'perspective', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'throwback', '1950s', 'post-atomic', 'fallout', 'science-fiction', 'giant', 'squids', 'giant', 'octopii', 'scorpians', 'locusts', 'spiders', 'ants', 'preying', 'mantises', 'result', 'man', 'carelessness', 'nuclear', 'detonations', 'story', 'course', 'nothing', 'Beth', 'Rob', 'had', 'sex', 'woooooooo', 'how', 'old', 'are', 'people', 'young', 'sophisticated', 'New', 'York', 'Yuppies', 'midwestern', 'twelve-year-olds', 'No', 'story', 'nothing', 'presentation', 'everything', 'point', 'view', 'central', 'gimmick', 'existential', 'premise', 'Versimilitude', 'unreal', 'made', 'look', 'real.Film', 'scholar', 'Louis', 'D.', 'Giannetti', 'reminded', 'years', 'new', 'camera', 'set-up', 'motion', 'picture', 'even', 'shots', 'presents', 'viewers', 'new', 'perspective', 'evaluate', 'what', 'see', 'Films', 'example', 'often', 'combine', 'omniscient', 'narration', 'first', 'person', 'director', 'may', 'cut', 'directly', 'first-person', 'subjective', 'point-of-view', 'shots', 'objective', 'camera', 'angles', 'close-ups', 'gauge', 'reactions', 'single', 'characters', 'long', 'shots', '[', 'UNDERSTAND', 'MOVIES', '2nd', 'ed', 'Englewood', 'Cliffs', 'N.J.', 'Prentice-Hall', '1976', ']', '.Many', 'films', 'have', 'years', 'relied', 'heavily', 'subjective', 'camera', 'e.g.', 'LADY', 'IN', 'THE', 'LAKE', '1946', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13th', 'blood-', 'baths', 'where', 'horny', 'teenages', 'Crystal', 'Lake', 'are', 'murdered', 'one', 'one', 'Jack', 'Arnold', '3-D', 'film', 'IT', 'CAME', 'FROM', 'OUTER', 'SPACE', '1953', 'audiences', 'are', 'given', 'control', 'earthlings', 'point', 'view', 'when', 'confront', 'aliens', 'aliens', 'perspective', 'device', 'audience', 'see', 'earthlings', 'victims', 'residents', 'sleepy', 'desert', 'town', 'Sand', 'Rock', 'Arizona', 'fimd', 'enveloped', 'billowing', 'fog', 'vision', 'viewers', 'stalk', 'victims', 'bubble-eye', 'aliens.CLOVERFIELD', 'part', 'subjective', 'camera', 'sub-genre', 'disarmingly', 'enough', 'clever', 'non-horror', 'title', 'quite', 'inspired', 'not', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'monster', 'movie', '1950s', 'awful', 'Godzilla', 'imports', 'tape', 'found', 'camcorder', 'whole', 'story', 'beginning', 'when', 'Rob', 'sneaking', 'up', 'Beth', 'morning-after', 'sequence', 'Coney', 'Island', 'close-ups', 'Beth', 'giggling', 'lens', 'ending', 'when', 'are', 'back', 'Coney', 'Island', 'part', 'tape', 'was', 'not', 'inadvertently', 'taped', 'over', 'beginner', 'Hud', 'coaxed', 'taking', 'videotaping', 'chores', 'hero', 'brother', 'who', 'record', 'party', 'celebrating', 'brother', 'departure', 'Japan', 'ending', 'tape', 'ending', 'film', 'showing', 'Rob', 'Beth', 'idyllic', 'time', 'together', 'mayhem', 'tape', 'now', 'according', 'beginning', 'film', 'become', 'part', 'official', 'government', 'documentation', 'events.The', 'New', 'York', 'setting', 'understandable', 'echoes', '9-11', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'panicked', 'characters', 'speculate', 'Fortunately', 'cinema', 'verite', 'plot', 'more', 'fleeing', 'citizens', 'scientists', 'military', 'types', 'saw', '1950s', '21st', 'century', 'dialogue', 'profanity', 'Even', 'one', 'military', 'officers', 'alumnus', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'television', 'series', 'onscreen', 'only', 'fleeting', 'hand-held', 'shots', 'wonder', 'complained', 'agent', 'even', 'see', 'scenes', 'enterprising', 'thieves', 'breaking', 'electronics', 'store', 'looting', 'aspect', 'disasters', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'too', 'real', 'commonplace', 'Even', 'hero', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'clone', 'phone', 'order', 'call', 'trapped', 'former', 'girl', 'friend', 'Beth', 'try', 'cross', 'bridge', 'Brooklyn', 'hero', 'brother', 'wiped', 'out', 'many', 'others', 'when', 'tail', 'gigantic', 'creature', 'historical', 'structure', 'So', 'much', 'being', 'iconoclast', 'first', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'decapitated', 'then', 'famous', 'bridge', 'sawed', 'half', 'respect.CLOVERFIELD', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'overnight', 'commercial', 'success', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'least', 'effective', 'denouement', 'just', 'downbeat', 'Quit', 'whining', 'shaking', 'camera', 'enjoy', 'experience', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'exercise', 'verisimilitude']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

658683,A18NB6VKNXHV7O,B00005JPXY,"Chris D. Bates ""Dave, the Man!!!""","[20, 29]","I'm a sucker for any kind of monster movie, and this one looked from the trailers to be fairly nasty. So even when the reviews came in that this was a feature-length gimmick in nauseating handheld with too little monster and too many yuppies--offset by some other reviews that said it was truly scary and that it's all a satire on precisely HOW moronic our single-minded consumer yuppies are today--I had to go see it for myself.This movie takes the Blair Witch Project idea [which, before that, was the Cannibal Holocaust idea] that what we're seeing is a videotape in the remains of some horrible catastrophe. Yes, the entire movie is in shaky, hand-cam video. We open in this fabulous loft in the Time Warner center. This is the apartment of Beth's dad, which she has just used to sleep with the vacuous Rob. It is he manning the camera, and he wakes Beth up with it and suggests they spend the day at Coney Island, which she has never been to. Then suddenly we're at this party a few months later--the earlier footage was stuff that was taped over for what we're seeing here. It's a fairly clever way to work flashbacks into the story with the stricture that we only see what the video sees. We are now at Rob's going-away party, as he is shipping off for a job in Japan. Rob's brother is taking the video, but soon recruits the blabbermouth moron Hud to assume duties, going around the party and taping video testimonials to what a sweet dude Rob is, Bro. Also on hand are Rob's brother's girlfriend Lily, and a woman Marlene, who clearly wants Hud to leave her alone so she can devote her full attention to her cell phone.So Beth shows up at the party with a date, and Rob, who has not seen or even called her since they slept together, that once, is angry and at one point implies that she's a slut for having a date, months later, with a guy who presumably calls her and is not moving to Japan. Okay, so Rob is a total tool. He gets worse. And ladies and gentlemen, this is your main character.Hud tapes Rob and Beth having a private conversation [tool!], then goes inside and spreads the news that they slept together to everyone [tool!]. There's a shot of Rob giving a speech that is interrupted by some other people taping it on their phones and such, and you wonder if this is a comment on our cameras-everywhere documentary society, and perhaps the people who seem only to be able to experience life through the interface of an electronic device. And of course, here we are in the audience, voyeurs watching their experience. Woah: indicted, dude. Totally, bro!So all of a sudden the lights go out and everyone runs up to the roof, where they see a huge explosion downtown. Then they all run down to the street, where the head of the Statue of Liberty lands nearby, followed by a stream of smoke that it an exact replica of certain 9/11 footage. Our heroes are all like, totally freaked, and end up trying to get across the Brooklyn Bridge to escape. While on it, Rob gets a cell phone call from Beth, alone in her dad's apartment at 59th street, and tries to talk to her as the bridge collapses and his brother is killed. They then run back to Lower Manhattan. Across from them, people are looting an electronics store, and Rob wanders in, looking for a battery for his phone so he can call Beth back, while ignoring the extreme danger and his friends' entreaties and the reality that his brother just died. He finds a battery, attempts to call, then decides that he must make his way up to rescue Beth, that girl he slept with once.Okay, so are we to understand that Rob is psychotic? He barely knows this woman, seems barely phased by the fact that his brother just died, is ignoring imminent peril, and is about to set off on an idiotic quest to rescue someone who will surely be dead by the time he arrives. I'm still not sure if we're supposed to find this all terribly brave and romantic, because all the signs point to Rob having lost his mind. So then what are we to think when his friends decide to go with him? That they've all lost their minds as well? That they are all such little vacuums who picked up their sense of human values from watching Braveheart reruns on TBS and beer commercials? These questions hang over the rest of the movie and further alienate you from the characters, none of which were that appealing anyway.SPOILERS > > >So they pop down the subway at Spring Street and pop up, ten minutes later, at 59th [approximately four miles], having been attacked by the little mini-monsters the big monster brought along for company. Beth's apartment tower has collapsed, and is leaning against another building so, nutcases that they are, they decide to scale the upright building and transfer to the semi-collapsed one--rather than attend to saving their own lives--in an effort to rescue a person whom no one has heard from for hours and is in all probability dead. They scale 57 flights while barely becoming winded [all those Pilates courses really WILL pay off in case of apocalypse!], rescue the woman who, although lying IMPALED for several hours, has not lost enough blood to prevent her from running down the street at full speed just a few minutes later. Talk about urban warriors!&lt; &lt; &lt; SPOILERS ENDDid I enjoy it? Only marginally. There was just too much of the yuppies and not enough of the monster [although the monster does seem to shadow our heroes with uncanny accuracy]. At times the monster is right over there and idiot Hud has the camera trained at his moron friends as they blab and fret. There were some good scares and the monster is freaky, but it's not really showing what you want to see. Oh, and by the way, the screenplay is made up almost entirely of ""Oh my God!,"" ""Rob!,"" and ""We gotta get out of here!""The conceit of showing the videotape supposedly shot at the scene is not only a way to save money overall, it is a way to deny a directorial presence, to deny that the movie is constructed at all, and while this works to a degree to provide the viewer with a heightened sense of immediacy and feeling that anything can happen, it also reduces the substance of the movie, and lends to the feeling that it's just a gimmick. It also, because there is no ostensible beginning, middle or end [and what there is could only detract from the overall conceit], leaving one with a feeling of, you know, having just watched a bunch of footage. Interesting, maybe, but without the overall shape and depth of a real movie and the resonance it may or may not leave you with.But the real problem is those insipid characters, and the problem, very distancing to me as an audience member, as to whether they've all had psychotic breaks or they're just phenomenally stupid. Hey, I've seen the movie and I still don't know, so if this is all some brilliant satire I'm not picking up on the clues that tell us that. If not, well, I'm sorry if the filmmakers think that these are intriguing or admirable characters. Matters do not end well for many of the characters involved, and it's hard not to realize that if Rob hadn't been such a dunderheaded sentimental narcissist, and if his friends had a little more spark in their synapses, many more of them would have survived to the end of the movie.SHOULD YOU WATCH IT?Like me, I'm sure you'll watch it regardless of what I say.

658684,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPXY,Chris Pandolfi,"[9, 17]","There are monster movies and then there's ""Cloverfield,"" a film that many have correctly described as a cross between the ""Godzilla"" films and ""The Blair Witch Project."" Rather than conventional movie cameras and conventional movie camera tricks, a handheld camcorder is utilized for this film, meaning that the visuals are effectively reduced to shaky close ups, choppy cuts, and problems with lighting and focusing. But camera tricks are only part of what makes ""Cloverfield"" so incredible: here's a film that reinvents the grade-B atomic films of the 1950s, first be eliminating the cheesy science fiction of outer space aliens, undersea creatures, and genetic mishaps, second by including a plausible and tense character story. This movie is not about camp--it's all about panic, fear, and the terror of a monstrous giant destroying New York City.The film's real genius is in its mystery. Much like the characters, we too are completely in the dark about the situation, and we remain so even after the film ends. What exactly is this creature? Where did it come from? Why is it attacking? Since these questions are never answered, your guess is as good as mine. And that's exactly the way it should be, since the science-related explanations of films like ""Godzilla,"" ""Them!"" ""Mothra,"" and ""It Came from Beneath the Sea"" are so worn out and ridiculous. We don't even get a real sense of what this creature looks like, although we are treated to some brief glimpses and a silhouetted long shot near the end of the film. I'll spare you a description, simply because I want this review to be just as elusive and enticing as the film's ad campaign.The human story is appropriately simple and insignificant, given the fact that we only care about the action. Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) has received and accepted a job opportunity from Japan; his friend, Lily (Jessica Lucas), and his brother, Jason (Mike Vogel), see him off with a surprise party, one that would have been a blast were it not for Rob's would-be girlfriend, Beth (Odette Yustman) showing up with another man. Assigned the task of capturing testimonials with a camcorder is his friend, Hud (T.J. Miller)--he quickly forgets his assignment and begins filming everything, including the inevitable fight between Rob and Beth. Hud also begins following a girl named Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), who doesn't know anyone at the party that well and doesn't seem too comfortable with Hud or the camera.Everything comes to a grinding halt when the ground momentarily shakes, causing the power to fluctuate and an oilrig near the Statue of Liberty to collapse. The news reluctantly speculates that an earthquake has struck New York City. But the truth is quickly revealed, and at that point, all hell breaks loose; an explosion across the river sends up a massive fireball, forcing everyone at the party to run out of the building. Soon after, the head of the Statue of Liberty comes skidding down the street, and that's immediately followed by the collapse of a massive skyscraper. The resulting cloud of dust and debris engulfs everything, forcing Hud, Rob, Jason, Lily, and Marlena to take refuge in a convenience store. While there, Marlena says something to the effect of, ""I saw it! It's alive!"" No one has a moment to question her because ground-splitting footsteps are shattering the windows.This is only the first in a series of terrifying events documented by Hud, who never once switches the camera off. The Brooklyn Bridge is destroyed as thousands attempt to cross it. Smaller, scorpion-like creatures fall off the giant monster and begin attacking; we eventually learn that being bitten by one of them isn't a good thing. Military units are swamped, not only because of their depleting manpower, but also because of the number of injured civilians. As the city crumbles, Rob gets a frantic cell phone call from Beth, and he realizes that she's trapped within the city. Feeling guilty over the fight they had earlier, he vows to find and save her, no matter what. Hud and the others follow more out of fear than anything else, which is understandable since the thought of being separated in the middle of a disaster is horrifying.Some of the most frightening moments take place underground, with the main characters traveling through New York's subway system. Who knows what could be lurking in the dark corners of the tunnels, away from the noise and chaos on the surface? And even if they do make it, what will they find when they emerge? Will there be anything left to find? Will something be waiting to find them? It's this maddening sense of uncertainty that makes ""Cloverfield"" more than just a monster movie rehash: there's genuine suspense coursing all throughout, and for once, it's BECAUSE of the gigantic monster, not IN SPITE of it. You know this is true when Beth's apartment building is finally revealed--it's leaning against a neighboring building like a domino ready to fall.We occasionally see bursts of old camera footage showing Rob and Beth at Coney Island, which was effective given their current emotional drama. It was also effective for the movie as a whole; I instantly recognized the escapist potential of this film when I saw its first teaser trailer back in July, but even after months of insider rumors and speculation, I never once thought that I'd be using words like ""brilliant"" to describe it. But the reality is that it is brilliant: brilliant as a horror film, brilliant as a thriller, and brilliant as a reinvention of the monster movie. ""Cloverfield"" may actually be one of the greatest monster movies ever made, a taut, unnerving, and completely original fright fest that doesn't lose itself to campy science fiction. It's set a new standard: The monster movie that subsequent monster movies will be compared to.",5,The Monster Takes Manhattan,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,5819,"['are', 'monster', 'movies', 'then',

658685,A1CYOHNGQ1WED1,B00005JPXY,Christopher Hivner,"[0, 0]","Cloverfield takes on a familiar movie subject, a monster appears out of nowhere and attacks New York City, destroying landmarks, crushing cars and eating people. The military is called in to deal with the beast. What makes Cloverfield unique is the way it is filmed and the fact that it doesn't attempt to explain what the monster is or where it came from.The entire movie is the recording of a personal video camera that was being used at a party to record the going away messages for the guest of honor. Because the guy manning the camera is a doofus we also get to eavesdrop on conversations that weren't meant for the tape, but help set up character development. When the attack begins everyone runs outside naturally to see what's going on and the doofus never puts down the camera believing that the event should be recorded for history.The rest of the movie we tag along with a group of friends as they try to rescue an injured friend from her destroyed apartment building and then find a way out of the city while the military attempts to destroy the monster.I enjoyed Cloverfield.

The characters were steriotypes of the current pack of 20/30 year olds and were not sympathetic at all, infact we started wagering as to who was going to do something stupid enough to get themselves killed - the best one being the ""camera-man"" who was so oblivious that he never noticed a 100+meter creature had snuck up opon him, really.The monster itself was never explored, infact it took an extra feature to even reveal that the creature was a hatchling.  All in all it was another example of Hollywood using the creature as simply a McGuffin Device - simply something to build a weak story around.  Even the Brits got it right with ""Gorgo"" by  following the Japanese in showing that monsters can be characters in their own story and often have a natural cause for their behavior, often enough to make the viewer wonder just who the real ""monsters"" are - a creature somehow wronged by man or man himself for not taking responcability for his mistakes.

Since all of us either know what this is about or can very easily find out, I'm not going to bother.  What I am going to do is point out some of the criticisms against this film and do my best to debunk them:1.  The camera movement is too shaky-True, it is very shaky and shaky to the point of being annoying.  Then again, how is the average person supposed to keep a camera steady while running away from a monster the size of a luxury liner?  Or from nasty dog-sized spiderlike vermin whose sting can literally make a person explode?2.  The dialogue is bad-When confronted with a life or death situation, do we:a.  Think of what Shakespeare or Marcel Proust would say?b.  Say only what is necessary and just try to stay alive?Cloverfield tries to speculate as to how REAL people would handle a giant monster attacking their city.  Real people don't have cool one-liners for every occasion.  That's life.3.  We don't learn where the monster comes from-After all the ridiculous explanations (extraterrestrial origin, radiation, etc.) we have been given over the years, do we really need another one?  Keep in mind that the main characters are not scientists or government insiders, they are just common people who are learning as they go along.  But mainly, their primary goal is just to survive.4.  We only catch momentary glimpses of the monster-No argument here.  If I was more artistically inclined and someone were to ask me to draw a complete picture of the Cloverfield monster, I would not be able to based on what I saw from the film.  Since the shots come from a cell phone camera, how could anyone get a perfect view?Take my explanations or leave them.  This movie in my opinion is the best giant monster film sinceJaws.  For having such a relatively small budget ($30 million), the effects are stunning.  The scenes in which we see the city's devastation actually looked realistic.  I also found the treatment of such a seemingly lowbrow subject matter to be surprisingly dignified and literate.Cloverfield does not try to be the next Godzilla film.

658692,A1JZZLIVXGJSIB,B00005JPXY,CinemaMinor,"[1, 6]","I was wondering why I hadn't seen this movie yet...and now I'm wondering why I did.  It is not good.  In order for this type of movie to work, there needs to be some level of buy-in from the viewer.  I'm not talking about suspension of disbelief -- a monster taking over Manhattan is pretty hard to believe.  But the storyline needs to be solid enough for the viewer to WANT to believe.  I just saw ridiculousness everywhere.  First there are the holes regarding the presence of the video camera that supposedly provided the content of the film.  For some reason, one of the main characters, Rob, had it in his possession during an impromptu one night stand with his best gal pal, Beth, at her apartment. (He used it to film their next day together, not their night, so don't get any ideas.)  I got the impression that he worked in finance or something of that ilk, as he was being transferred to Japan, and was not a documentarian.  About six weeks later, Rob's brother, Jason and Jason's girlfriend, Lily, have this same camera, which belongs to Rob, in their possession to film Rob's going away party.  Rob's best friend, Hud, ends up with those duties and captures the group's night-long efforts to save each other from/escape the inexplicable monster that is desroying the city.  There is no reason for Hud, who is also not a documentarian, not to have dropped the camera during the mayhem other than to give this movie a reason for being.  Apparently the writers noticed this problem because it was explained away by Hud stating that filming the events was a good distraction from them, or something like that.  In addition to the camera's bizarre ubiquitousness, I was surprised by its exceptional performance and fortitude during the night's trials and tribulations; it survives as a prize possession as everyone is getting mauled.  Also, and this might be nit-picky, but given the level of damage to the city, the power outage that occurs probably wouldn't have been so brief, except an actual power outage would have posed cinematic problems.  In addition, Rob receives a well-signaled cell phone call in the subway while the U.S. military is grappling with the chaos the monster is causing above ground even though circuits were previously jammed; this is quite fortuitous (getting a text message through maybe -- but a full-fledged phone call underground under these circumstances???).  Lily is adept at walking literally miles of subway track in high heels which she finally takes off when she has to climb multiple flights of stairs; at this point she would've have two sprained ankles.  I don't want to delve too deeply into the story and ruin it for those who do want to watch, so to sum things up, in my opinion, the ""Godzilla"" movies are more realistic.  I'm sure ""Cloverfield"" fans can explain away all of the things that I interpreted as ridiculous, but the fact is, I found them to be distracting.  Granted, they might be more distracting for those of us who are familiar with the lay of the land in NYC.  If you really enjoy the ""found footage"" trope to the point where you can forgive a thin and flawed storyline, then this movie might work for you.  It didn't for me.  And I'm a huge fan of the horror genre so it's not like I need things to be realistic -- I do need them to pull me in as opposed to keeping me at arm's length, noticing how silly they are.",1,Not good.,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,3381,"['was', 'wondering', 'why', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'now', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'good', 'order', 'type', 'movie', 'work', 'be', 'level', 'buy-in', 'viewer', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'monster', 'taking', 'over', 'Manhattan', 'pretty', 'hard', 'believe', 'storyline', 'be', 'solid', 'enough', 'viewer', 'WANT', 'believe', 'just', 'saw', 'ridiculousness', 'everywhere', 'First', 'are', 'holes', 'regarding', 'presence', 'video', 'camera', 'supposedly', 'provided', 'content', 'film', 'reason', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Rob', 'had', 'possession', 'impromptu', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'best', 'gal', 'pal', 'Beth', 'apartment', 'used', 'film', 'next', 'day', 'together', 'not', 'night', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'ideas', 'got', 'impression', 'worked', 'finance', 'something', 'ilk', 'was', 'being', 'transferred', 'Japan', 'was', 'not', 'documentarian', 'six', 'weeks', 'later', 'Rob', 'brother', 'Jason', 'Jason', 'girlfriend', 'Lily', 'have', 'same', 'camera', 'Rob', 'possession', 'film', 'Rob', 'going', 'away', 'party', 'Rob', 'best', 'friend', 'Hud', 'up', 'duties', 'group', 'night-long', 'efforts', 'save', 'other', 'from/escape', 'inexplicable', 'monster', 'desroying', 'city', 'reason', 'Hud', 'who', 'also', 'not', 'documentarian', 'not', 'have', 'dropped', 'camera', 'mayhem', 'other', 'give', 'movie', 'reason', 'being', 'Apparently', 'writers', 'noticed', 'problem', 'was', 'explained', 'away', 'Hud', 'stating', 'filming', 'events', 'was', 'good', 'distraction', 'something', 'addition', 'camera', 'bizarre', 'ubiquitousness', 'was', 'surprised', 'exceptional', 'performance', 'fortitude', 'night', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'prize', 'possession', 'everyone', 'getting', 'mauled', 'Also', 'might', 'be', 'nit-picky', 'given', 'level', 'damage', 'city', 'power', 'outage', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'so', 'brief', 'actual', 'power', 'outage', 'would', 'have', 'posed', 'cinematic', 'problems', 'addition', 'Rob', 'well-signaled', 'cell', 'phone', 'call', 'subway', 'U.S.', 'military', 'grappling', 'chaos', 'monster', 'causing', 'ground', 'even', 'circuits', 'were', 'previously', 'jammed', 'quite', 'fortuitous', 'getting', 'text', 'message', 'maybe', 'full-fledged', 'phone', 'call', 'underground', 'circumstances', 'Lily', 'adept', 'walking', 'literally', 'miles', 'subway', 'track', 'high', 'heels', 'finally', 'off', 'when', 'climb', 'multiple', 'flights', 'stairs', 'point', 'would', ""'ve"", 'have', 'two', 'sprained', 'ankles', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'delve', 'too', 'deeply', 'story', 'ruin', 'who', 'do', 'want', 'watch', 'so', 'sum', 'things', 'up', 'opinion', 'Godzilla', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'realistic', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Cloverfield', 'fans', 'can', 'explain', 'away', 'things', 'interpreted', 'ridiculous', 'fact', 'found', 'be', 'distracting', 'Granted', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'distracting', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'lay', 'land', 'NYC', 'really', 'enjoy', 'found', 'footage', 'trope', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'forgive', 'thin', 'flawed', 'storyline', 'then', 'movie', 'might', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'horror', 'genre', 'not', 'need', 'things', 'be', 'realistic', 'do', 'need', 'pull', 'as', 'opposed', 'keeping', 'arm', 'length', 'noticing', 'how', 'silly', 'are']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

But then, in a sudden realization of ""oh yeah, this was a movie, right?"", people realize a good premise and a neat idea might not make a good film. That film was ""Snakes on a Plane"" where just the story sounded more fun than what the film did with it and in a way, Cloverfield suffered the same fate. First appearing as an enigmatic teaser trailer before ""Transformers"", many people were abuzz about this new film, shot in a unique style with a very familiar genre. But is this a good film, or just a good idea stretched too long?Rob Hawkins is going away to take on a very impressive job in Japan and his brother, Jason along with girlfriend Lily plan a surprise going-away party for him one night. Documenting the night is ""Hud"", who's kind of a goofball and who also has eyes for Marlena, who doesn't even know Rob but came along anyway. But the celebration's cut short when earthquakes happen, explosions occur in the distance and a roaring sound is heard from down the street.I always like watching these bigger-than-life movies but there was always something ""filmy"" about it and the great directors like Spielberg and Cameron know how to let the direction tell the story while still maintaining that sense of tension and excitement. Yet, with a movie, entirely shot to make it look like it was on a handheld will have some issues with people. Why does everything look so staged, as if certain glimpses of the monster are just fleeting enough and most people wouldn't shoot the way he does. But it's also fun to see a monster movie in a very compacted style and it helps bring out the reality even when you know they had to break out the computers for most of this stuff. While I personally never got sick of all the handheld moving every which way, some are going to find it distracting the camera never seems to wanna sit still.Despite that, the film is actually quite exciting and when things get loud and frantic, there's actually quite a lot of suspense and pulse-pounding stuff that goes on and even though it's not completely showing you all you'd like to say, it's quite a blast to watch actually. And forgive the fact that a store-bought video camera will produce a theatre-ready sound experience too since it's nitpicking; although to be fair, there's a lot of weird plot things you can balk at. With quite a few memorable images and sequences, it probably won't make sense all the way through but at least it's fun anyway.However as a film, it doesn't entertain quite so much since the good rule of thumb for a horror movie is have likable, relatable characters first and then throw them in the fire and even after some scenes at a party, we still don't get a full sense of the characters. While we're not going to exactly have characters all of a sudden monologue after being attacked by a 350-foot creature and there's even some moments for the actors to get a bit emotional, it doesn't really feel enough either.Let's face it: the big release this week is this movie so I bet most people are going to watch this anyway.

As if global warming and terrorism wasn't enough.  ""Cloverfield"" is the military designation codename for an ""LSA"" or ""Large Scale Agressor"" scenario.  The film plays as a firsthand eyewitness video account of a Godzilla-type monster on shore leave in NYC.If you can suspend the disbelief that no one in their right mind would continue to videotape while smack dab in the middle of such an unbelievablably monumental catastrophe, your enjoyment of this film might increase by a few marginal points.  The hand-held video camera style photography lends a realistic credibility to the proceedings but does nothing to promote any sharp picture resolution.  To me, the notion of rendering this movie in 1080p High Definition makes about as much sense as gold-plating one's toilet bowl.  You'll have the prettiest crapper on the block but so what?  The HD picture only serves to further augment the grainy pixilated imagery so common with low-grade digital video.Don't get me wrong, the sub-par picture resolution does nothing to diminish the film's ambitious production value.  The 5.1 Dolby True HD surround sound is a revelation.  Crank the volume on this one.  Your neighbors will love you for it.This DVD is loaded with extras, all presented in HD as well: Director audio commentary, outtakes, deleted scenes, alternate endings, Easter eggs, and three featurettes covering production, visual effects and creature design.  But exclusive to the blu-ray edition is the most impressive feature of all: a Special Investigation Mode which allows you to watch the film with pop-up military intel that gives you background on the creature and the people involved, along with a GPS map of Manhattan which shows you exactly where the creature is in relation to the protagonists and the action taking place on the screen.This is an all-together solid package but I can't recommend it if you already own the regular DVD version.  For the enterprising filmmaker or digital effects artist, this DVD offers an insightful look into the filmmaking process.",3,"Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today....",1212537600,"06 4, 2008",2008,2192,"['good', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'break', 'days', 'next', 'big', 'external', 'threat', 'cinematically', 'level', 'city', 'yet', 'again', 'global', 'warming', 'terrorism', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Cloverfield', 'military', 'designation', 'codename', 'LSA', 'Large', 'Scale', 'Agressor', 'scenario', 'film', 'firsthand', 'eyewitness', 'video', 'account', 'Godzilla-type', 'monster', 'shore', 'leave', 'NYC.If', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'one', 'right', 'mind', 'would', 'continue', 'videotape', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'such', 'unbelievablably', 'monumental', 'catastrophe', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'might', 'increase', 'few', 'marginal', 'points', 'hand-held', 'video', 'camera', 'style', 'photography', 'realistic', 'credibility', 'proceedings', 'nothing', 'promote', 'sharp', 'picture', 'resolution', 'notion', 'rendering', 'movie', '1080p', 'High', 'Definition', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'sense', 'gold-plating', 'one', 'toilet', 'bowl', ""'ll"", 'have', 'prettiest', 'crapper', 'block', 'so', 'what', 'HD', 'picture', 'only', 'further', 'augment', 'grainy', 'pixilated', 'imagery', 'so', 'common', 'low-grade', 'digital', 'video.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'sub-par', 'picture', 'resolution', 'nothing', 'diminish', 'film', 'ambitious', 'production', 'value', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'True', 'HD', 'surround', 'sound', 'revelation', 'Crank', 'volume', 'one', 'neighbors', 'will', 'love', 'it.This', 'DVD', 'loaded', 'extras', 'presented', 'HD', 'as', 'well', 'Director', 'audio', 'commentary', 'outtakes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'endings', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'three', 'featurettes', 'covering', 'production', 'visual', 'effects', 'creature', 'design', 'exclusive', 'blu-ray', 'edition', 'most', 'impressive', 'feature', 'Special', 'Investigation', 'Mode', 'watch', 'film', 'pop-up', 'military', 'intel', 'background', 'creature', 'people', 'involved', 'GPS', 'map', 'Manhattan', 'exactly', 'where', 'creature', 'relation', 'protagonists', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'screen.This', 'all-together', 'solid', 'package', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'already', 'own', 'regular', 'DVD', 'version', 'enterprising', 'filmmaker', 'digital', 'effects', 'artist', 'DVD', 'insightful', 'look', 'filmmaking', 'process']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

658704,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00005JPXY,C. Sawin,"[6, 10]","The movie that what seems like everyone has been talking about since the middle of last year finally arrived this past Friday in theaters. Cloverfield could be the monster movie surrounded with the most hype to ever be made. Don't confuse that with being the biggest monster movie ever made. It just has the most hype. If you couldn't tell by the trailer, the main premise of the film is that a monster attacks Manhattan. There isn't much story after that, but the beginning of the film goes a little something like this:Rob is leaving for Japan since he finally got that promotion he's been working so hard for. His friends have decided to surprise him and throw him a big going away party. As a token to remember them by, Lily wants her boyfriend Jason(who's also Rob's brother), to film testimonials from everyone at the party wishing Rob the best of luck in Japan. Jason winds up passing the duty onto Hud, who only takes the job because he finds out Marlena will be at the party whom he has a crush on. Things aren't so good for Rob though as he's in love with Beth. They used to date and Rob even filmed a romantic weekend they had(which you see snippets of throughout the movie). After that weekend though, Rob didn't contact Beth since he was going to be leaving for Japan. Beth took that as a sign that Rob wasn't interested and moved on. She shows up at the party with another guy named Travis. Rob and Beth get into an argument about the way things left off between them and Beth and Travis wind up leaving because of it. Rob winds up sulking about Beth until Jason and Hud go to talk to him. They basically tell Rob that he needs to go after Beth since he's in love with her. Then a loud crash is heard and all the lights go out. That's when all hell breaks loose.From here on out, the film revolves around a) the monster attacking the city b) everyone running for their lives and c) the military trying to take it down. There's a scene where Rob, Lily, Marlena, and Hud are running in the street and they wind up right in front of the monster, then the military comes out of nowhere and just starts blasting it with all the firepower they have. That's one of the most intense scenes in the movie. Worth the price of admission alone. The real gem of the film is the fact that it's all shot with a handheld camera. There is that risk of having motion sickness. It actually affected me a bit in the beginning, but you actually get used to it once the action starts. The camcorder makes things more personal. You get to follow one group of people as they try to survive this mayhem. If it was shot as just a normal movie, it wouldn't be nearly as good. It'd basically be like every other monster movie anyone has ever seen. The acting is also done very well. You believe the horror they're going through. It's the type of film that makes you feel like you need to go back and see it again because you know you missed something.I did have a few nitpicks about the movie though. The main one being that it felt like it took forever for things to start happening. The motion sickness thing also bothered me more during Rob's party than it did when the city was being destroyed. The other big one was that you never really get a clear shot of the monster. You get glimpses of it and enough to make out certain body parts and how many limbs it has, but even when you finally get to SEE the monster while it's bright outside...the monster is too dark to make out all the details. Don't get me wrong, you still see some of it. I guess I just wanted to see all of it in plain daylight. My other minor nitpick was the ending. It just felt...kinda rushed or something. It wasn't fulfilling. I guess it was to Rob and Beth's story, but it felt like there needed to be something else. Something more.Some people were upset that the movie didn't provide any answers. Things like where the monster came from and why it's attacking aren't explained in the film. I hear the viral marketing campaign provided a lot of answers and I wish I would've taken part in it when I had the chance. I've caught some of it, but not enough to fully understand everything. The thing is though...you don't really need any answers. You're seeing the film from Hud's point of view. You know what they know, which isn't much. The film accomplished what it set out to do and that's make a pretty good monster movie. And who says everything has to be explained right away anyway? Sometimes once the origin of something this massive is explained, then it's not nearly as good. Sometimes it's better not knowing.So, bottom line, I really enjoyed Cloverfield. It's actually one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. I actually liked the monster and I'm considering going to see it again. I've already read about a few things I missed the first time around. I'm wondering if there's anything else. I also left out a few things intentionally. A few key parts to the movie concerning the monster, how certain characters die, etc. I have to leave something for you when you see the movie, right? Despite having a few flaws, I think it lived up to the hype. I do plan on owning it once it's released on DVD and I'm more than willing to see a Cloverfield 2...if that rumor is true.Rating: 8/10",4,It's Alive! It's Huge!

658705,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B00005JPXY,Cubist,"[5, 10]","Cloverfield was the first media sensation of 2008 and an excellent case study in canny marketing. A teaser trailer appeared in theaters months ahead and featured a few, brief, tantalizing scenes of chaos in Manhattan with no mention of a title or who was in it. The only thing that was certain was that J.J. Abrams was somehow involved. Fans speculated about possible similarities to his TV showLost - The Complete First Seasonor the possibility that he had masterminded a new kind of monster movie. This teaser trailer sparked intense interest on the Internet which the studio brilliantly exploited with snippets of information staggered over succeeding weeks. The marketing paid off and the buzz resulted in a strong opening weekend and decent critical reaction.There is an audio commentary by director Matt Reeves. He starts off talking about the genesis of the project and how he got the gig. Reeves says that he resisted the urge to have a lot of obvious edits in favour of long takes or invisible edits in order to mimic a film actually shot by an average person who was there. To that end, he points out that the style of the film was meant to suggest that anyone could have shot it. This is an engaging and informative track with very few lulls.""Document 01.18.08: The Making of Cloverfield"" takes a look at how the film came together amid a shroud of secrecy. The use of hand-held cameras is examined and how it gave the film an authenticity. The on-the-set footage shows how it was filmed, mostly on a soundstage which is amazing because it doesn't look it in the film. We see several scenes being shot and it is fascinating to see how they pulled it off.""Cloverfield Visual Effects"" examines how they virtually destroyed Manhattan with CGI effects. The fore and middle ground of scenes were real with practical sets while the background was a mix of CGI and good ol' Matte paintings. This featurette takes us through the major SFX set pieces and shows us how they did them.""I saw it! It's alive! It's huge!"" J.J. Abrams was inspired by Godzilla and its iconic status in Japan and he wanted to do that for America. This featurette takes a look at how the creature was designed and why it looks the way it does.""Clover Fun"" are outtakes and bloopers as the cast blow their lines and goof around.Also included are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Reeves. There is more footage from Rob's farewell party and more of him and his friends in the subway tunnels including more from the aftermath of the attack there.There are two alternate endings with optional commentary by Reeves.

Supposedly the ""cam corder view"" is an attempt at hyperrealism, but all it succeded in doing for me was take me out of the moment time and again. There is nothing at all ""realistic"" about a hand held camera that always catches every important event and facial expression and that never gets dropped even when its operator is running through wreckage, dodging monsters and leaping from building to building.This movie was no better than any number of Made For Sci-Fi Channel TV movies I've seen.",2,Doesn't Play by It's Own Rules,1210204800,"05 8, 2008",2008,734,"['notice', 'raving', 'Amazon', 'editorial', 'review', 'off', 'saying', 'Cloverfield', ""n't"", 'play', 'usual', 'rules', 'Well', ""n't"", 'play', 'own', 'rules', 'either', 'film', 'totally', 'reliant', 'gimmick', ""n't"", 'even', 'use', 'properly', 'Supposedly', 'cam', 'corder', 'view', 'attempt', 'hyperrealism', 'succeded', 'doing', 'was', 'take', 'moment', 'time', 'again', 'nothing', 'realistic', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'always', 'catches', 'important', 'event', 'facial', 'expression', 'never', 'dropped', 'even', 'when', 'operator', 'running', 'wreckage', 'dodging', 'monsters', 'leaping', 'building', 'building.This', 'movie', 'was', 'better', 'number', 'Made', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'TV', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release
658707,A3FRSTRMPLO3GE,B00005JPXY,"DaBoss ""Steven""","[1, 3]","Cloverfield (2008) - Matt ReevesGoing into the movie, I was not expecting anything out of the ordinary, which is ridiculous in itself considering the movie is anything but ordinary in its conception.  Actually, to be more specific, the plot itself is extremely banal, and I could honestly care less for most of the characters.  What is in fact most unique about the film, and by far its most interesting ""character"", is the hand held camera.  By basically viewing the action through the eyes of the holder of the camera for the duration of the film, the audience literally becomes a part of the action.  In fact, ideally, we feel everything the characters feel: their fears, hopes, excitement, etc.  However, unfortunately, the film has a few major flaws that, I feel, prevent it from achieving the status of a truly great movie.  Instead, it ends up becoming an extremely interesting diversion.First of all, and this is the problem with a lot of movies that are extremely ""gimmicky"", the gimmick is TOO much the focus.  In other words, developments in the plot happen not due to character, which is how it should be, but seemingly only for the sake of coolness.  What ends up happening is the plot and characters end up feeling contrived, cliche, and even relatively light.  And when I say ""for the sake of coolness"", I mean that when a specific plot point occurs, what I feel is happening in the director's mind is ""Oh, it would be cool to have the characters do this, so that the audience can experience this, too.""  The problem with that concept is that in its execution, a lot of the plot points end up inevitably weak, at least in the context of the film.  For example, Rob saving Beth is relatively ridiculous because as an audience member, you never feel that they truly loved each other in the first place.  In other words, the only reason to have Rob save her, and to have Hud (the holder of the camera) follow, is to lengthen the effect of the gimmick, which is an obvious tactic because the film is relatively short in duration.  Therefore, what ends up ultimately happening is that Cloverfield, instead of being a truly great film, ends up being a lesser film filled with great moments.  And yes, it has a few truly great moments.  I refer specifically to the first sequence that starts with the explosion that the characters witness from the balcony and ends with the flying head of the Statue of Liberty.  The helicopter flight to escape the city is an example of another fantastic sequence.So, overall, the movie is definitely a worthwhile watch, and I recommend it without hesitation.  Just do not expect anything more than a visceral thrill ride, and you will be fine.  Oh, and do beware that the camera movement can be extremely jarring and potentially nauseating.  One of my friends actually had to leave the theatre because he began to feel extremely sick.",3,A unique experiment that pays homage to the monster movies of old.,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,2877,"['Cloverfield', '2008', 'Matt', 'ReevesGoing', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'anything', 'ordinary', 'ridiculous', 'considering', 'movie', 'anything', 'ordinary', 'conception', 'Actually', 'be', 'more', 'specific', 'plot', 'extremely', 'banal', 'could', 'honestly', 'care', 'less', 'most', 'characters', 'What', 'fact', 'most', 'unique', 'film', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'basically', 'viewing', 'action', 'eyes', 'holder', 'camera', 'duration', 'film', 'audience', 'literally', 'part', 'action', 'fact', 'ideally', 'feel', 'everything', 'characters', 'feel', 'fears', 'hopes', 'excitement', 'etc', 'However', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'few', 'major', 'flaws', 'feel', 'prevent', 'achieving', 'status', 'truly', 'great', 'movie', 'Instead', 'up', 'becoming', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'diversion.First', 'problem', 'lot', 'movies', 'are', 'extremely', 'gimmicky', 'gimmick', 'TOO', 'much', 'focus', 'other', 'words', 'developments', 'plot', 'not', 'due', 'character', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'seemingly', 'only', 'sake', 'coolness', 'What', 'up', 'happening', 'plot', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'feeling', 'contrived', 'cliche', 'even', 'relatively', 'light', 'when', 'say', 'sake', 'coolness', 'mean', 'when', 'specific', 'plot', 'point', 'what', 'feel', 'happening', 'director', 'mind', 'Oh', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'have', 'characters', 'do', 'audience', 'can', 'experience', 'too', 'problem', 'concept', 'execution', 'lot', 'plot', 'points', 'end', 'up', 'inevitably', 'weak', 'least', 'context', 'film', 'example', 'Rob', 'saving', 'Beth', 'relatively', 'ridiculous', 'audience', 'member', 'never', 'feel', 'truly', 'loved', 'other', 'first', 'place', 'other', 'words', 'only', 'reason', 'have', 'Rob', 'save', 'have', 'Hud', 'holder', 'camera', 'follow', 'lengthen', 'effect', 'gimmick', 'obvious', 'tactic', 'film', 'relatively', 'short', 'duration', 'Therefore', 'what', 'up', 'ultimately', 'happening', 'Cloverfield', 'instead', 'being', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'lesser', 'film', 'filled', 'great', 'moments', 'yes', 'few', 'truly', 'great', 'moments', 'refer', 'specifically', 'first', 'sequence', 'explosion', 'characters', 'witness', 'balcony', 'flying', 'head', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'helicopter', 'flight', 'escape', 'city', 'example', 'fantastic', 'sequence.So', 'overall', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worthwhile', 'watch', 'recommend', 'hesitation', 'Just', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'anything', 'more', 'visceral', 'thrill', 'ride', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'Oh', 'do', 'beware', 'camera', 'movement', 'can', 'be', 'extremely', 'jarring', 'potentially', 'nauseating', 'One', 'friends', 'actually', 'had', 'leave', 'theatre', 'began', 'feel', 'extremely', 'sick']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release
658708,A2FDFWRBCU8ERY,B00005JPXY,Daddy,"[1, 1]","I have mixed feelings about this movie.  On the one hand, it is a really scary and intense monster movie. On the other hand, some of the scenes and footage are uninteresting, badly put together, and seemingly unnecessary.  The premise is that a monster attacks Manhattan and the whole movie is supposed to be the video evidence of a young man who filmed the event. So, as it is entirely from the POV of the guy with the video camera, it is naturally jumpy and chaotic footage to watch.  The first half hour of the movie is just footage of this camera guy, his girlfriend and their group of friends, just hanging out and doing the usual college friends kind of things. Then, the action begins when they see an explosion across town and flaming debris come flying towards them. From there, they spend the rest of the time running around in a panic, trying to escape the area or investigate the catastrophe - sometimes, it's unclear which of these they are doing.  It is not until the head of the statue of liberty comes flying through the air and lands on the street in front of them that they start to be aware of the monster... though some people just gawk and photograph the head, instead of looking in the other direction where danger is approaching.  Some of the so-called footage is unrealistic - such as when they rescue their friend from her hi-rise apartment building (which is in ruins and falling down), the camera guy continues to film instead of helping or holding on for dear life as they make their way out of the trecherous wreckage.  And when the camera guy actually gets attacked by the monster, the camera is still filming... presumably within the jaws of the creature and even when his body is dropped to the ground.  It even continues filming when they are in a helicopter crash.  If you can accept the premise that anyone could actually keep a video camera in tact and working throughout this whole ordeal, then it makes the movie work, despite certain unrealistic moments.  The creature is a cross between a giant crustacean and a giant lizard... very imaginatively created. It has the added terror of shedding what seems to be its hatched young all over the place... these are small, spider-like versions of the larger creature. On the whole, this is a pretty good monster movie, though with the disappointment of no explanations as to what the creature is, where it comes from, or why it's suddenly attacking Manhattan.  The viewer is left with many questions because the film ends when the two surviving young people are hiding in a tunnel and summarize what has happened to them for the sake of ""anyone who finds this camera"".  I enjoyed most of the movie, it was very scary and suspenseful - for the most part.  But, as much as I did enjoy it, I have to add that it is the sort of forgettable monster movie I may not ever watch again.",3,Chaotic but intense monster movie,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,2860,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'really', 'scary', 'intense', 'monster', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'scenes', 'footage', 'are', 'uninteresting', 'badly', 'put', 'together', 'seemingly', 'unnecessary', 'premise', 'monster', 'Manhattan', 'whole', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'video', 'evidence', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'filmed', 'event', 'So', 'entirely', 'POV', 'guy', 'video', 'camera', 'naturally', 'jumpy', 'chaotic', 'footage', 'watch', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'just', 'footage', 'camera', 'guy', 'girlfriend', 'group', 'friends', 'just', 'hanging', 'out', 'doing', 'usual', 'college', 'friends', 'kind', 'things', 'Then', 'action', 'when', 'see', 'explosion', 'town', 'flaming', 'debris', 'come', 'flying', 'towards', 'there', 'spend', 'rest', 'time', 'running', 'around', 'panic', 'trying', 'escape', 'area', 'investigate', 'catastrophe', 'sometimes', 'unclear', 'are', 'doing', 'not', 'head', 'statue', 'liberty', 'flying', 'air', 'street', 'front', 'start', 'be', 'aware', 'monster', 'people', 'just', 'gawk', 'photograph', 'head', 'instead', 'looking', 'other', 'direction', 'where', 'danger', 'approaching', 'so-called', 'footage', 'unrealistic', 'such', 'when', 'rescue', 'friend', 'hi-rise', 'apartment', 'building', 'ruins', 'falling', 'down', 'camera', 'guy', 'film', 'instead', 'helping', 'holding', 'dear', 'life', 'make', 'way', 'trecherous', 'wreckage', 'when', 'camera', 'guy', 'actually', 'attacked', 'monster', 'camera', 'still', 'filming', 'presumably', 'jaws', 'creature', 'even', 'when', 'body', 'dropped', 'ground', 'even', 'filming', 'when', 'are', 'helicopter', 'crash', 'can', 'accept', 'premise', 'anyone', 'could', 'actually', 'keep', 'video', 'camera', 'tact', 'working', 'whole', 'ordeal', 'then', 'movie', 'work', 'certain', 'unrealistic', 'moments', 'creature', 'cross', 'giant', 'crustacean', 'giant', 'lizard', 'very', 'imaginatively', 'created', 'added', 'terror', 'shedding', 'what', 'be', 'hatched', 'young', 'place', 'are', 'small', 'spider-like', 'versions', 'larger', 'creature', 'whole', 'pretty', 'good', 'monster', 'movie', 'disappointment', 'explanations', 'what', 'creature', 'where', 'why', 'suddenly', 'attacking', 'Manhattan', 'viewer', 'left', 'many', 'questions', 'film', 'when', 'two', 'surviving', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'hiding', 'tunnel', 'summarize', 'what', 'happened', 'sake', 'anyone', 'who', 'camera', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'most', 'part', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'enjoy', 'have', 'add', 'sort', 'forgettable', 'monster', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'ever', 'watch', 'again']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

According to the ""making-of"" documentary, the filmmakers were wanting to create an ""American Godzilla.""  Well, they didn't.  But what they DID do is create a film that is certainly a worthwhile watch, that does have something to say, even if it doesn't quite reach the expectations the filmmakers set out for.The movie starts out at a goodbye party.  A young man (names are inconsequential, we'll get to that in a moment) is heading to Japan (they didn't make their homages very subtle, did they?).  A friend-who-is-more-than-a-friend shows up at his party (with another guy), then promptly leaves.  While our main character is mourning, something happens.  The earth shakes.  They race to the top of their building.  There's an explosion.  They race down to the street.  The head of the Statue of Liberty rolls by.  They race to the Brooklyn Bridge.  They race...They race around.  Except for an interesting sequence where they're stuck on a subway platform.  But basically, they're racing.  Which is good--because, if these characters stuck around anywhere for long, we wouldn't give a rat's petoot what happened to them.  The acting wasn't all that bad, really--it's just, the characters weren't likeable.  The movie started out like a soap opera, but that is a bit of a necessity--it MUST start out mundane, for us to realize the significance of what is going on.  If only the characters were interesting...Nevermind.  The star here is the monster.  And the cinematography.  I've seen complaints that the camera work is too jerky; well, no kidding.  In order to capture what this event would really be like (don't want monsters, okay, substitute a terrorist attack), we must see it through the eyes of the characters involved.  Or, rather, the eyes of ONE character involved--in this case, Hud, a funnyman who is charged with filming the evening's events (then decides to document everything else when the proverbial you-know-what hits the proverbial fan).  This is where ""Cloverfield"" earns its worth--it a horror story told uniquely ONLY from the point of view of the victims...and not even that, but a small group of victims, arguably ONE victim.  It is a movie about a global event told through the eyes of a single character.  If for that reason alone, ""Cloverfield"" will get your mind and blood racing.

The unadulterated Japanese cut of the film, which has only been released in the west relatively recently, is a stark warning against the misuse of Atomic energy released in a country that less than a decade before had suffered its defining moment of the twentieth century at the hands of the Atom bomb. At the time of its release, the first generation of 'Hibakusha'  were still suffering the direct effects of the atrocities committed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the scenes of municipal halls crammed to capacity with people suffering radiation sickness, the wholesale destruction of Tokyo, and the unforgettable scene of a nation mourning its loss through a choral radio broadcast would've struck a deeply horrific, resonant chord with the Japanese audience of its time. Time and the Toho company's lucrative franchise have almost completely eroded the original power and intent of the film from history and replaced it with a farrago of sequels featuring increasingly outlandish monsters duking it out in badly realised model cities. Considering this, I'd argue that 'Cloverfield'  is probably the only true spiritual sequel to Ishiro Honda's film ever made in that it uses more or less the same concept to similarly examine a defining moment of national history and evoke the horrors of a collective international tragedy and its aftermath. In this case, that moment is the 911 attacks and the nation is America and, by association and the proliferation of more technologically advanced broadcast technologies, the world. 911 haunts every frame of the film. When one observes the shaky hand-held vistas of ash-covered New Yorkers hiding in grocery stores to avoid the billowing detritus of falling buildings, one can't help but relate it to the footage captured by the French film-makers, the Naudet bros. in the haunting documentary,9/11 - The Filmmakers' Commemorative Edition. There have been a lot of questions asked around the subject of whether it was tasteful or indeed right to frame a ""monster movie"" in a verite style which mimics video footage of a national tragedy. To those people I would say, ""you're missing the point"". While nominally a monster movie in appearance, 'Cloverfield' is really no more about a giant undersea arthropod than 'Gojira' was about a giant lizard; both are merely cyphers for forces in our daily lives which could run out of control and devastate our world and both are filmed in a style which is evocative and relevant to the audiences of their time. The creatures of both stories are barely seen - a stylistic choice which suggests that one should not attach too much importance to the cause but rather the effects. The reasons behind the destruction in Cloverfield remain nebulous and unresolved and as the final haunting frames of the film draw to the close, it is ultimately the human cost of the destruction that the audience is left to consider rather than the origins of its agent.",4,Apocalypse Then And Apocalypse Now,1235174400,"02 21, 2009",2009,3343,"['56', 'years', 'release', 'originalGojira', '/', 'Godzilla', 'Deluxe', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Gojira/Godzilla', '[', '1954', ']', '/', 'Godzilla', 'King', 'Monsters', '[', '1956', ']', 'intent', 'themes', 'protagonist', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'redefined', 'remodelled', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'point', 'now', 'Western', 'zeitgeist', 'amusing', 'pop', 'cultural', 'shorthand', 'bad', 'special', 'effects', 'ridiculous', 'plots', 'unadulterated', 'Japanese', 'cut', 'film', 'only', 'been', 'released', 'west', 'relatively', 'recently', 'stark', 'warning', 'misuse', 'Atomic', 'energy', 'released', 'country', 'less', 'decade', 'had', 'suffered', 'defining', 'moment', 'twentieth', 'century', 'hands', 'Atom', 'bomb', 'time', 'release', 'first', 'generation', ""'Hibakusha"", 'were', 'still', 'suffering', 'direct', 'effects', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'scenes', 'municipal', 'halls', 'crammed', 'capacity', 'people', 'suffering', 'radiation', 'sickness', 'wholesale', 'destruction', 'Tokyo', 'unforgettable', 'scene', 'nation', 'mourning', 'loss', 'choral', 'radio', 'broadcast', 'would', ""'ve"", 'struck', 'deeply', 'horrific', 'resonant', 'chord', 'Japanese', 'audience', 'time', 'Time', 'Toho', 'company', 'lucrative', 'franchise', 'have', 'almost', 'completely', 'eroded', 'original', 'power', 'intent', 'film', 'history', 'replaced', 'farrago', 'sequels', 'featuring', 'increasingly', 'outlandish', 'monsters', 'duking', 'out', 'badly', 'realised', 'model', 'cities', 'Considering', ""'d"", 'argue', ""'Cloverfield"", 'probably', 'only', 'true', 'spiritual', 'sequel', 'Ishiro', 'Honda', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'concept', 'similarly', 'examine', 'defining', 'moment', 'national', 'history', 'evoke', 'horrors', 'collective', 'international', 'tragedy', 'aftermath', 'case', 'moment', '911', 'attacks', 'nation', 'America', 'association', 'proliferation', 'more', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'broadcast', 'technologies', 'world', '911', 'haunts', 'frame', 'film', 'When', 'one', 'shaky', 'hand-held', 'vistas', 'ash-covered', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'hiding', 'grocery', 'stores', 'avoid', 'billowing', 'detritus', 'falling', 'buildings', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'relate', 'footage', 'captured', 'French', 'film-makers', 'Naudet', 'bros.', 'haunting', 'documentary,9/11', 'Filmmakers', 'Commemorative', 'Edition', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'questions', 'asked', 'subject', 'was', 'tasteful', 'indeed', 'right', 'frame', 'monster', 'movie', 'verite', 'style', 'mimics', 'video', 'footage', 'national', 'tragedy', 'people', 'would', 'say', ""'re"", 'missing', 'point', 'nominally', 'monster', 'movie', 'appearance', ""'Cloverfield"", 'really', 'more', 'giant', 'undersea', 'arthropod', ""'Gojira"", 'was', 'giant', 'lizard', 'are', 'merely', 'cyphers', 'forces', 'daily', 'lives', 'could', 'run', 'control', 'devastate', 'world', 'are', 'filmed', 'style', 'evocative', 'relevant', 'audiences', 'time', 'creatures', 'stories', 'are', 'barely', 'seen', 'stylistic', 'choice', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'attach', 'too', 'much', 'importance', 'cause', 'rather', 'effects', 'reasons', 'destruction', 'Cloverfield', 'remain', 'nebulous', 'unresolved', 'final', 'haunting', 'frames', 'film', 'draw', 'close', 'ultimately', 'human', 'cost', 'destruction', 'audience', 'left', 'consider', 'rather', 'origins', 'agent']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release
658717,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B00005JPXY,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[2, 4]","So the camera is swinging and lofting and lurching about like a rabid bat on a blood bender, whirling and gyring and wheeling and ducking and lurching about the facial topography of a bazillion pimply, bleary eyed denizens of a New York cocktail party.I'm getting dizzy. I'm getting a little sick. I'm really relating to the character Marlena (tasty Lizzy Kaplan, who suffers a fate that shouldn't happen to a sick dog) in the movie, who does an on-screen puke. Blarf. I'm thinking I've made a terrible mistake. I'm thinking there's 90 minutes of my life I'm not going to ever get back.I'm wrong.Because about 11 minutes into this thing, right about the point where the lead (Michael Stahl-David, as Rob Hawkins) is mooning about the loss of his newly beloved Beth & commiserating with brother Jason and buddy Hud (T.J. Miller soldiering on as the cameraman, by sheer chance and naivete), there's this batrachian howl of rage, or fury, or hunger, constipation (or all of the above) out over the water near Liberty Island, and the whole flick goes wild.""Cloverfield"" is a work of insurgent genius: it's about a lonely primal howl of a very different sort---the howl of impending Extinction. And lemme tell ya, baby, it's never easy to be the scouting party headed down Dinosaur Trail.""Cloverfield"" is what happens when man---with his 24/7 Internet and email, his up to the second cellphone coverage (except when Giant Monsters Attack!), his field artillery barrage of News on the Move, his pointless cares and useless concerns---gets rudely shouldered over in the Great Galactic Food Chain.It's a movie of totally immersive apocalyptic art, the horror film as nerve jangling stimulant, a kind of hyperkinetic cinematic terrorism. It is brutal. It is scary. It is vicious.And it pulled off something I considered impossible---it disturbed me. Boiled down to its guts, it's a different kind of Ground Zero, and it certainly taps edgily into the horror of 9/11: when the New York Life Building collapes, there's this great moment when a street sweeping wall of smoke and debris comes plowing down the alley and a gaggle of fugitives hunkers down behind the counters and aisles of a darkened pharmacy they've commandeered as a lifeboat against the Terror, and it sorta sets the tone.It's a story of the Day the Earth didn't just stand still, but screamed and ran like a rabbit, and of the Monster who really took Manhattan and used it as an All-you-Can-Eat buffet table.The remarkable thing JJ Abrams and his director Mike Reeves have done is a brilliant little trick of cinematic wizardry, by which he transforms the handheld shaky-came from annoying barrier to excruciatingly intimate portal into a once sane, recognizable world battered into Nightmare Territory.There are some true shockers here, some things that shook me up: the glimpses of a smoke and destruction shrouded Thing working its destruction high up among the lofty spires in the clouds; the frantic shots of a writhing hateful brood which drip off its carapace like snaggle-footed lice and perambulate wildly on the ground like carnivorous Mexcian jumping beans; a girl popping like a blood blister behind the immodest blue screen of a biohazard tent; the terrible spectacle of a highrise buckled in on its neighbor or a battle-tank squashed like an aphid.Some killjoys have posted unexpurgated screenshots of the Creature (or at least Critter #1) in all its warts-and-all CGI glory, waving dismissively that the thing is not the least bit scary.Don't listen to them---besides, what does a still shot prove about menace? Take a gander at a photograph of John Wayne Gacey: he hardly looks like the human shark he was in 3-D life. Set him in motion, unchain his black heart and unshackle his free range menace, and the proposition is entirely different.So it is with the menace and creeping doom of ""Cloverfield"", possibly the most engaging horror flick I've seen since ""Aliens"": it's less about a Giant Monster (though happily boasting not one, but several, and in a few varieties) and far more about the kind of total Madness that tears off the mask of Civilization and lets us see the bony grinning face of Apocalypse.""Cloverfield"" is a wicked little mainline of pure malice and surprisingly nasty cold grue, the paranoid, deeply deranged 21st century's backhanded french kiss to Godzilla and Global Terror.JSG",5,One Giant Monster can ruin your whole Day,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,4374,"['camera',

658718,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B00005JPXY,Daryl B,"[2, 8]","When I saw the trailer for this movie several months ago, I couldn't wait to see the film.  As time passed, however, I grew worried that perhaps this film could turn out to be another ""Snakes on a Plane""----all internet hype and buzz with absolutely no payoff.  This time, thankfully, the buzz was correct.As a kid I grew up enjoying monster movies and its been a long time since we've had a really good film showing a city in danger from a horrifying and mysterious force that can destroy everything in its path.  Recently, Peter Jackson gave us ""King Kong"", who is a sympathetic figure taken from his home and placed in an alien environment against his will.  Jackson, an amazing director, made a good film but the first hour of his film was dull, until we finally reached Skull Island and met the giant ape.  1998's ""Godzilla"" didn't give us the scare I'd hoped for either.  It showed promise but in the end didn't deliver the thrill that I experienced as a kid with the old monster movies.""Cloverfield"" changes all that.  Producer JJ Abrams and director Matt Reeves look to enhance the monster genre with a more realistic and updated look and feel.  While I admit, I was anxious the first 20 minutes to get to the action and a bit frustrated with the shaky ""hand-held"" camera format, I grew accustomed to the filming and was lost to the suspense once the creature and its path of destruction was revealed.  Also, I like the fact that the cast is pretty much unknown, thus providing no distraction from the true star of the film, the monster and the carnage of New York City.  Reeves gives us just enough glimpses of the monster to pique our interest but not overwhelming us with a CGI monster that might come off too unrealistic.Some people are obviously aggravated with the lack of facts and answers about the monster, its origins, its survival or destruction and other questions that the film didn't answer.  For me, I enjoyed the fact that we didn't know everything and this aspect of the movie only added to the mystery and suspense of the film.  I don't think we need answers to everything to truly enjoy a storyline in a movie or television show.  Sometimes, our imagination can fill in the blanks better than most directors can and the unknown can really be more frightening than the truth.To sum up, this time, a movie lived up to its much-hyped trailer.  Congratulations to Reeves and Abrams on an interesting and thrilling movie that does justice to all celluloid monsters in the history of Hollywood.  I'll be interested to see what extras are included on the dvd, which I will be buying.

K,"[2, 6]","CLOVERFIELD****  Out of 5Release Date- January 18th, 2008Running Time- 84-MinutesRating- PG-13Screenplay- Drew GoddardDirector- Matt ReevesStarring- Michael Stahl-David, Odette Yustman, T.J. Miller, Jessica Lucas, Lizzy Caplan, Mike VogelCloverfield is a prime example how ratings don't mean anything when it comes to crafting a well made and suspenseful movie. There's a lot of backlash on PG-13 horror flicks and how they suck and while some movies do need an R-rating a horror film can still be effective with a PG-13 rating. Many of my favorite horror films are from the 30s and if released now would only get a PG rating and they are some of the most chilling horror films of all time. The problem these days with PG-13 is they are poorly made and well I can name plenty of poorly made R-rated films. I love splatter flicks and I love seeing hot women naked as well, but you really don't need either to make a great horror movie and Cloverfield is proof of that.I avoided this movie for the longest time and finally gave in and watched it and I didn't expect much of anything out of it, but what I got was one of the best horror films of 2008. There was a lot of hype surrounding Cloverfield and this is one of the few times the hype was legit. Cloverfield is a well crafted and even creepy movie at times and due to the hype there is bound to be a backlash and there is bound to be hate since it's cool to hate anything that makes it big.In 2008 the hand held camera style of filmmaking made a big comeback it was first made famous by The Blair Witch Project (though it owes a bit to Cannibal Holocaust). 2008 saw the theatrical release of George Romero's Diary of the Dead, Quarantine (remake of REC) and of course Cloverfield. I personally didn't like the way it was used in Blair Witch, but if used right it can be really effective and the movies that used in 2008 it worked well and Cloverfield might be the most effective in terms of the hand held camera. The one thing I hate is the shaky cam unless used right and most of the time it isn't. But here in Cloverfield it worked really well and added to the confusion the characters were feeling and the hand held camera adds a bit of realism to the movie.The screenplay by Drew Goddard was well written and the characters are interesting and even likeable. Running at only 84-minutes and the action starts off pretty quickly there's not a lot of time to develop the characters, but due to the way the movie was done it actually works to the advantage of the movie. Due to the way the movie was done giving a lot of depth to the characters wouldn't have worked I think the fact only the first act did a little bit of development worked well here and the characters benefit from not being too developed.Director Matt Reeves does a fantastic job with Cloverfield; the movie only runs at 84-minutes (less with closing credits) and by around the 15-minute mark is when things start to happen and I thought for sure Cloverfield would run out of steam, but to my surprise it never did. Reeves, also manages to create some really great tense moments and is able to sustain it for pretty much the whole movie. The scenes in the subway are highly effective and are actually fairly creepy. There was a moment or two when it felt like Cloverfield was about to run out of steam, but Matt Reeves is able to again elevate the suspense and tension.Some of the scariest scenes happen early in the movie as there are explosions and there's this sense of panic and confusion, which is bound to remind people of 9/11. Living in New York and seeing these scenes really made me think back to that. Seeing people running as a cloud of dust is heading towards them and people take shelter in a store is very reminiscent of 9/11, which I suppose was some of the influence on Cloverfield. These scenes are bound to strike a chord with those living in New York at the time of the terrorist attack.The performances in Cloverfield are solid and they feel like real people rather than actors playing characters, which is always a good thing. My only complaint is one thing a certain character does at the end of the movie is kind of idiotic, but that's the writing and not the acting, but even with a few scenes like that the actors manage to sell it and make it believable.The only complaint I really have is at the end when we see the monster in the daytime. I personally felt that took a little away from the movie, but besides that Cloverfield was surprisingly excellent and in my opinion one of the very best horror movies of 2008.",5,"I expected the worst, but I have to say this was excellent",1238025600,"03 26, 2009",2009,4566,"['CLOVERFIELD****', 'Out', '5Release', 'Date-', 'January', '18th', '2008Running', 'Time-', '84-MinutesRating-', 'PG-13Screenplay-', 'Drew', 'GoddardDirector-', 'Matt', 'ReevesStarring-', 'Michael', 'Stahl-David', 'Odette', 'Yustman', 'T.J.', 'Miller', 'Jessica', 'Lucas', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'Mike', 'VogelCloverfield', 'prime', 'example', 'how', 'ratings', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'when', 'crafting', 'well', 'made', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'lot', 'backlash', 'PG-13', 'horror', 'flicks', 'how', 'suck', 'movies', 'do', 'need', 'R-rating', 'horror', 'film', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'effective', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'Many', 'favorite', 'horror', 'films', 'are', '30s', 'released', 'now', 'would', 'only', 'get', 'PG', 'rating', 'are', 'most', 'chilling', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'problem', 'days', 'PG-13', 'are', 'poorly', 'made', 'well', 'can', 'name', 'plenty', 'poorly', 'made', 'R-rated', 'films', 'love', 'splatter', 'flicks', 'love', 'seeing', 'hot', 'women', 'naked', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'make', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'Cloverfield', 'proof', 'that.I', 'avoided', 'movie', 'longest', 'time', 'finally', 'gave', 'watched', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'anything', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'films', '2008', 'was', 'lot', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'Cloverfield', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'hype', 'was', 'legit', 'Cloverfield', 'well', 'crafted', 'even', 'creepy', 'movie', 'times', 'due', 'hype', 'bound', 'be', 'backlash', 'bound', 'be', 'hate', 'cool', 'hate', 'anything', 'big.In', '2008', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'made', 'big', 'comeback', 'was', 'first', 'made', 'famous', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'bit', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', '2008', 'saw', 'theatrical', 'release', 'George', 'Romero', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'Quarantine', 'remake', 'REC', 'course', 'Cloverfield', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'way', 'was', 'used', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'used', 'right', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'effective', 'movies', 'used', '2008', 'worked', 'well', 'Cloverfield', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'effective', 'terms', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'one', 'thing', 'hate', 'shaky', 'cam', 'used', 'right', 'most', 'time', ""n't"", 'here', 'Cloverfield', 'worked', 'really', 'well', 'added', 'confusion', 'characters', 'were', 'feeling', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'bit', 'realism', 'movie.The', 'screenplay', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'even', 'likeable', 'Running', 'only', '84-minutes', 'action', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'not', 'lot', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'due', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'actually', 'advantage', 'movie', 'Due', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'giving', 'lot', 'depth', 'characters', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'think', 'fact', 'only', 'first', 'act', 'did', 'little', 'bit', 'development', 'worked', 'well', 'here', 'characters', 'benefit', 'not', 'being', 'too', 'developed.Director', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'fantastic', 'job', 'Cloverfield', 'movie', 'only', '84-minutes', 'less', 'closing', 'credits', '15-minute', 'mark', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'happen', 'thought', 'sure', 'Cloverfield', 'would', 'run', 'steam', 'surprise', 'never', 'did', 'Reeves', 'also', 'create', 'really', 'great', 'tense', 'moments', 'able', 'sustain', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'movie', 'scenes', 'subway', 'are', 'highly', 'effective', 'are', 'actually', 'fairly', 'creepy', 'was', 'moment', 'two', 'when', 'felt', 'like', 'Cloverfield', 'was', 'run', 'out', 'steam', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'able', 'again', 'elevate', 'suspense', 'tension.Some', 'scariest', 'scenes', 'happen', 'early', 'movie', 'are', 'explosions', 'sense', 'panic', 'confusion', 'bound', 'remind', 'people', '9/11', 'Living', 'New', 'York', 'seeing', 'scenes', 'really', 'made', 'think', 'back', 'Seeing', 'people', 'running', 'cloud', 'dust', 'heading', 'towards', 'people', 'take', 'shelter', 'store', 'very', 'reminiscent', '9/11', 'suppose', 'was', 'influence', 'Cloverfield', 'scenes', 'are', 'bound', 'strike', 'chord', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'time', 'terrorist', 'attack.The', 'performances', 'Cloverfield', 'are', 'solid', 'feel', 'real', 'people', 'rather', 'actors', 'playing', 'characters', 'always', 'good', 'thing', 'only', 'complaint', 'one', 'thing', 'certain', 'character', 'end', 'movie', 'kind', 'idiotic', 'writing', 'not', 'acting', 'even', 'few', 'scenes', 'actors', 'manage', 'sell', 'make', 'only', 'complaint', 'really', 'have', 'end', 'when', 'see', 'monster', 'daytime', 'personally', 'felt', 'took', 'little', 'away', 'movie', 'Cloverfield', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'excellent', 'opinion', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', '2008']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

Most of the negative reviews posted refer to the cinematic release of ""Cloverfield"" which some folks suffered from motion sickness. Odds are, that is not going to happen to you with this DVD release (unless you own that 100"" Sony plasma TV recently rolled out). I saw ""Cloverfield"" in the theater and had no problem, and watching the DVD last night posed no problem at all for my wife who is prone to motion sickness.That aside, I have to say, ""Cloverfield"" is a fun, and very clever movie. I'm not going to run down the basic storyline as I'm not into spoiling any aspect of the film (feel free to browse through the mulitude of reviews that spell out exactly how the film unfolds if you wish). Besides, by now you most likely know the basics of the movie.Sure it's a monster movie, a very cool monster movie, told in a unique way. You actually get to root for some of the characters which is odd, considering most of the time in horror films is spent rooting for the monster.The one aspect I loved about ""Cloverfield"" is that the creature is not ""misunderstood"", or ""a harmless animal who is frightened and doing what it would naturally"". NO the Big-McLarge-Huge monster in ""Cloverfield"" is mean, and sinister. This beast is out to hurt, maim, destroy and eat anything in it's path without mercy. It's big and it's ticked off at us for some reason. Sure there may be little to no backstory on the beast.....GREAT. I don't want to know how, why, or from where this thing decided to attack.

658728,A3GHBLTVJLRPAH,B00005JPXY,Derek,"[3, 4]","For most people, you either loved this film, or you completely despised it. As for me, there were things that I loved about this film, and things that I didn't care for. Cloverfield follows several twenty-somethings as they try to escape a city being attacked by a giant Godzilla-like creature.I think that this film was a landmark in motion picture history in two ways. The first landmark is how they campaigned for the film. It was brilliant. Successfully keeping this movie in the dark, they released a trailer that showed us very little and only had a date instead of a title. People who looked up this date online found a website that only had a couple pictures. From here, the advertisers used a number of techniques to publicize the film and pique audiences' interest. The main website would be updated occasionally with pictures that gave clues about the stories. Several of the characters had MySpace pages and online video blogs. There were several fake news and business websites created to help give further background to the story. All in all, it was an amazing form of advertising that got audiences excited for the film and accounted for a great deal of profit that the studio could not have made any other way.The second landmark is the way they filmed the movie. This is where most audience members grew to hate the film. The movie was filmed as if we saw everything from a handheld camera being used by one of the characters. This added a great deal of realism and believability to the story where we felt like we were watching a YouTube-like video of an actual event. But this also meant that there was a lot of camera-shake in the process and anyone who had motion-sickness did not make it far into the movie. While it's true thatThe Blair Witch Projectstarted the hand-held technique, I believe it was this film that showed the true potential and effectiveness of filming in this form. It was this film that started the hand-held craze and later inspired other films likeQuarantineandParanormal Activity.Aside from that, the movie itself wasn't all that good. The movie echoed Godzilla a lot, so we felt like we had seen this film a dozen times before. There was really nothing to new to see. Another thing that bothered me was the lack of background story in the film. A lot of the background information was covered in the campaign sites for the film, but if you never looked at any of those, you were left with a lot of questions.**Spoiler Alert**Apparently, - and they don't tell you this in the film anywhere - the object landing in the ocean at the end of the film was a failed satellite that crashed to the earth and awoke a monster that had been hibernating underwater for thousands of years. The monster was supposed to be a baby looking for its mother.**End Spoiler Alert**Overall, the movie was a good thrill ride with lots of good special effects and scares, but not good enough to be seen over and over again.As far as questionable content:There is some violent monster mayhem, a couple of gore moments (one person is attacked by a monster and some blood sprays on the camera; a person explodes behind a curtain; one character is chewed up in the monster's mouth) and some profanity throughout the film.[...]",3,You either love it or hate it.,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,3242,"['most', 'people', 'either', 'loved', 'film', 'completely', 'despised', 'were', 'things', 'loved', 'film', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Cloverfield', 'several', 'twenty-somethings', 'try', 'escape', 'city', 'being', 'attacked', 'giant', 'Godzilla-like', 'creature.I', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'landmark', 'motion', 'picture', 'history', 'two', 'ways', 'first', 'landmark', 'how', 'campaigned', 'film', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Successfully', 'keeping', 'movie', 'dark', 'released', 'trailer', 'showed', 'very', 'little', 'only', 'had', 'date', 'instead', 'title', 'People', 'who', 'looked', 'up', 'date', 'online', 'found', 'website', 'only', 'had', 'couple', 'pictures', 'here', 'advertisers', 'used', 'number', 'techniques', 'publicize', 'film', 'pique', 'audiences', 'interest', 'main', 'website', 'would', 'be', 'updated', 'occasionally', 'pictures', 'gave', 'clues', 'stories', 'Several', 'characters', 'had', 'MySpace', 'pages', 'online', 'video', 'blogs', 'were', 'several', 'fake', 'news', 'business', 'websites', 'created', 'help', 'give', 'further', 'background', 'story', 'was', 'amazing', 'form', 'advertising', 'got', 'audiences', 'excited', 'film', 'accounted', 'great', 'deal', 'profit', 'studio', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'other', 'way.The', 'second', 'landmark', 'way', 'filmed', 'movie', 'where', 'most', 'audience', 'members', 'grew', 'hate', 'film', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'saw', 'everything', 'handheld', 'camera', 'being', 'used', 'one', 'characters', 'added', 'great', 'deal', 'realism', 'believability', 'story', 'where', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'YouTube-like', 'video', 'actual', 'event', 'also', 'meant', 'was', 'lot', 'camera-shake', 'process', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'motion-sickness', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'far', 'movie', 'true', 'thatThe', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Projectstarted', 'hand-held', 'technique', 'believe', 'was', 'film', 'showed', 'true', 'potential', 'effectiveness', 'filming', 'form', 'was', 'film', 'started', 'hand-held', 'craze', 'later', 'inspired', 'other', 'films', 'likeQuarantineandParanormal', 'Activity.Aside', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'movie', 'Godzilla', 'lot', 'felt', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'dozen', 'times', 'before', 'was', 'really', 'nothing', 'new', 'see', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'lack', 'background', 'story', 'film', 'lot', 'background', 'information', 'was', 'covered', 'campaign', 'film', 'never', 'looked', 'were', 'left', 'lot', 'questions', '**Spoiler', 'Alert**Apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'film', 'anywhere', 'object', 'landing', 'ocean', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'failed', 'satellite', 'crashed', 'earth', 'awoke', 'monster', 'had', 'been', 'hibernating', 'underwater', 'thousands', 'years', 'monster', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'baby', 'looking', 'mother', 'Spoiler', 'Alert**Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'thrill', 'ride', 'lots', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'scares', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'seen', 'again.As', 'far', 'questionable', 'content', 'violent', 'monster', 'mayhem', 'couple', 'gore', 'moments', 'one', 'person', 'attacked', 'monster', 'blood', 'sprays', 'camera', 'person', 'curtain', 'one', 'character', 'chewed', 'up', 'monster', 'mouth', 'profanity', 'film.', '[', ']']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

That being said i'm not disappointed with purchasing it, but given the opportunity again.  I would probably just rent and watch it for an hour and 20 minutes then promptly return it the next day.None the wiser to the ending which i must say i didnt even come close to liking at all.

Cloverfield's documentary style isn't just a gimmick; it's absolutely essential to the film's success.  We see and hear only what the characters do, and in a word, it's chaos.  The film starts slowly (not in a bad way), then with a bang it becomes a relentless exercise in frantic stimulus overload.  And for me, it works spectacularly.I'm not sure what to say to the people who complain about not seeing much of the monster, or about the abrupt ending.  I guess those people also hate Open Water and Blair Witch, both of which I also love.  They're three films that are genuinely scary to me, because psychological scare tactics are so much more effective than any CGI monster could ever be.  In Cloverfield, the camera work, the chaos on screen, and the sounds you hear off camera but don't see create enough tension that you don't need to see the monster in order to fear it.I won't argue with anyone who hates the shaky camera, though.  I started the movie thinking ""Oh boy, this is gonna be rough"" - but by the end, I loved it.  Combined with some amazing set design and special effects, it brings a sense of realism to the film that I've rarely seen in horror.  The acting may draw some criticism too, but I thought it was decent enough, and even fairly good by horror movie standards.Bottom line - Cloverfield is a classic (in my mind, at least) and I can't wait to have it on DVD and watch it again.",5,Believe the hype (just this once),1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,1569,"['few', 'hours', 'ago', 'entered', 'theater', 'expecting', 'decent', 'not', 'necessarily', 'great', 'movie', 'instead', 'was', 'treated', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Cloverfield', 'documentary', 'style', ""n't"", 'just', 'gimmick', 'absolutely', 'essential', 'film', 'success', 'see', 'hear', 'only', 'what', 'characters', 'do', 'word', 'chaos', 'film', 'slowly', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'then', 'bang', 'relentless', 'exercise', 'frantic', 'stimulus', 'overload', 'spectacularly.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'say', 'people', 'who', 'complain', 'not', 'seeing', 'much', 'monster', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'guess', 'people', 'also', 'hate', 'Open', 'Water', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'also', 'love', ""'re"", 'three', 'films', 'are', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'psychological', 'scare', 'tactics', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'CGI', 'monster', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'Cloverfield', 'camera', 'work', 'chaos', 'screen', 'sounds', 'hear', 'camera', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'create', 'enough', 'tension', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'monster', 'order', 'fear', 'it.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'argue', 'anyone', 'who', 'shaky', 'camera', 'started', 'movie', 'thinking', 'Oh', 'boy', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'rough', 'end', 'loved', 'Combined', 'amazing', 'set', 'design', 'special', 'effects', 'sense', 'realism', 'film', ""'ve"", 'rarely', 'seen', 'horror', 'acting', 'may', 'draw', 'criticism', 'too', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'enough', 'even', 'fairly', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'standards.Bottom', 'line', 'Cloverfield', 'classic', 'mind', 'least', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'have', 'DVD', 'watch', 'again']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

Which is why CLOVERFIELD, despite its wacky premise (a Godzilla-like monster/demon destroying the Big Apple), struck me as so very real.  As soon as the ""event"" began to happen, I immediately and effortlessly suspended disbelief, and got into this movie, which fascinated through every frame.I've heard comparisons made to ""Blair Witch Project""; yet Blair was laughable sophistry (we're supposed to be scared because the characters find little props in the woods).  CLOVERFIELD shows us the real deal--there's definitely a monster under the bed, and he's a force to be reckoned with.  We follow a group of friends (who ad lib superficial, melodramatic lines, but come on, people say stupid stuff when they're frightened) who don't run from the monster. . .they run towards all the terror to ""rescue"" an injured ex-girlfriend.  All the while, destruction and carnage reign supreme (the special effects are spellbinding), and our friends pay the ultimate price for all their dodging and weaving.  The climactic scene is a definite eye-opener.With its queasy, handheld camera motion, CLOVERFIELD looks and feels all too real.

The film is centered on a major monster attack in New York City that effect a group of young adults.The film starts off with the group of young adults attending a going away party for their friend, Rob(Michael Stahl-David). At the party, Rob's friend Hud(T.J. Miller) is videotaping everyone's farewells to Rob. The movie, is told from Hud's video camera the entire time. During the party, things start to get out of hand when a huge monster strikes the city and chaos begins.This movie was a disappointment for me. I for one, am not really into scary or horror type films, even though this didn't exactly fill that genre. I guess it'd be cateogorized more as a thriller, but even so I was disappointed. The ending was in my opinion, horrible. There was a huge buildup to nothing. A lot of characters came and went quite quickly that it was hard to care for them.I did enjoy that it actually looked like it was filmed by this character Hud the entire time. I really really liked that aspect of it, because it made it more real and more exciting to the story.  It felt like everything that was happening in the city and with these characters was real and genuine. But like I said before, it was hard to really care for these characters because some of them weren't in it for that long so I wasn't exactly sad to see them go.The story was unique, it starts off as some sort of romantic drama with Rob leaving for Japan and also leaving the love of his life, Beth(Odette Yustman). They are best friends who love each other but of course neither of them know it, and on the camcorder there are videos of Beth and Rob having sweet conversations and having a really great time together but then disaster strikes and the audience is reminded that they are watching a monster flick. So, I really enjoyed seeing snippets of happier times through the camera and trying to understand their relationship.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys monster movies and anyone who can view 85 minutes of film on a shaky hand held camera. It was decent, but I definitely wouldn't watch it again.Want to get the latest reviews and movie news?

However, the overall effect never really gets you involved with the story. The monster is only seen in quick glimpses untill the very end of the film. There is no clear resolution to the film's story, other than you know that there is a military attack on the monster and that the camcorder was found later on.

Petersen,"[2, 4]","The combination of both mystery and hype really intrigued me about Cloverfield before its release; I started seeing TV spots that hardly gave away anything and I saw posters of a headless statue of liberty all over New York City. I'm a huge fan of the TV show LOST, so when I heard the producer of this film was J.J. Abrams, (LOST's creator) I was immediately sold. I went to the theaters opening weekend with two of my friends (both who ironically have motion sickness) and from the moment the film started with the ""Classified"" screen, I was hooked.From the moment things started going down in the city, I found it hard for my eyes to leave the screen and I was on the edge of my seat. What a thrilling experience! The FX of the monster was nearly flawess (in my opinion, if it looked phony or cheesy, this film would've failed. Period.) The ""Alien-esque"" spawns of the beast were also very well done (one of the characters meets a horrible fate due to one of them.) While my friends were a bit bothered by the shaky-cam, I wasn't annoyed in the slightest... it only added to the realism (like the Blair Witch Project, another movie I found to be creepy and unique.) I actually cared for the characters in this film and wanted them to make it out of this situation alive.I read a LOT of negative reviews for this film on Amazon, to my surprise, but I guess it really is a love-it or hate-it film. I personally LOVED it and found it to be an exciting and different take on the over-done ""monster invades the city"" films. I felt as though I was in the movie, seeing everything through the eyes of the characters and the ending was perfect. Also, people are complaining about NO plot or not enough information given... um, yeah, that's sort of the point! We see only what the characters see which adds to the exciting mystery of it.

658740,A3VQLTB724O77W,B00005JPXY,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[8, 12]","I saw Cloverfield with some trepidation--I was aware of the bad reviews, and I hate bad horror films, but I love good ones so I thought I'd take a chance.  And despite all the bad reviews, I'm glad I did, for Cloverfield is the perfect monster movie.  Is it confusing and badly explained?  Absolutely--but just remember how confusing 9/11 was, even if you were not caught up in the midst of it.  What Cloverfield does so well, that so few movies even try--horror or not, is to put us, the viewer, right in the middle of the action.  We are not an invisible, omniscient watcher, we are as much as possible a participant, in the character of Hud (most of the time) who carries a video camera through the action.  Sure, it's been done before--Blair Witch Project--and to much criticism then, too.  Some people just want their movies told in the traditional format.  But to be made to FEEL what it might be like to be in these events, you just can't do that.  Perhaps it was Steven King (in his story The Mist) who first realised that the people on the ground are too busy fighting for their lives to care much where the monster comes from--and also that if a monster appears, it might not be obvious at all where it comes from anyway.  We, as the audience, naturally want to know, but that's where Cloverfield breaks from tradition (as did Blair Witch)--that knowledge is no more forthcoming to us than it is to Hud and his friends--because we ARE Hud and his friends.  And if you wonder how Hud could be looking through the viewfinder all the time, he isn't--early on the camera is transfered and there is clearly a strap that holds the thing around waist level--which is why some of the shots focus on peoples legs and feet rather than their faces.But Cloverfield does follow some horror monster traditions, and to great effect, especially those concerning pacing and the reveal.  The pacing (in spite of certain reviewer's comments who simply seem to have forgotten the quiet moments, as one naturally does--but they are there) is beautifully handled.  At the point when you're wondering if you actually went to the right theater, the monster strikes, and then events build to a climax, with a brief glimpse of the monster, and settle back down.  The movie continues cresting and ebbing like a series of ever more horrifying waves, always maintaining some aspect of mystery about the creature's appearance until the final minutes of the film.  And it's a glorious monster, too--knobby and hideous and alien, pretty clearly inspired by the idea of a wingless bat but unlike anything I've really seen before.  I don't buy it as an undersea creature myself--anything that big that lived in the ocean wouldn't have the musculature or skeletal structure to stand on land, much less withstand aerial bombing--but of course, that's not the point, it's not real anyway.Those who quibble about the acting and characterizations and the two day growth of beard puzzle me--sure, not everyone lets their beard grow over the weekend, but plenty do.  The actors were superb in their parts, and even the main character, who had the most difficult selling job--going back toward the monster to rescue his girlfriend rather than escaping--showed just the right amount of conviction for his cause mixed with understanding and concern for his friends' situation.Admittedly, Cloverfield isn't for everyone--if you hated the narrative style or camerawork of Blair Witch, then definitely save your money.  But if the shock of Alien made you think that's the standard which horror should aspire, then rush out and get Cloverfield now.  You'll have a good day.",5,The Perfect Monster Movie,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",2008,3635,"['saw', 'Cloverfield', 'trepidation', 'was', 'aware', 'bad', 'reviews', 'hate', 'bad', 'horror', 'films', 'love', 'good', 'ones', 'thought', ""'d"", 'take', 'chance', 'bad', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Cloverfield', 'perfect', 'monster', 'movie', 'confusing', 'badly', 'explained', 'Absolutely', 'just', 'remember', 'how', 'confusing', '9/11', 'was', 'even', 'were', 'not', 'caught', 'up', 'midst', 'What', 'Cloverfield', 'so', 'well', 'so', 'few', 'movies', 'even', 'try', 'horror', 'not', 'put', 'viewer', 'right', 'middle', 'action', 'are', 'not', 'invisible', 'omniscient', 'watcher', 'are', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'participant', 'character', 'Hud', 'most', 'time', 'who', 'video', 'camera', 'action', 'Sure', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'much', 'criticism', 'then', 'too', 'people', 'just', 'want', 'movies', 'told', 'traditional', 'format', 'be', 'made', 'FEEL', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'be', 'events', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'Steven', 'King', 'story', 'Mist', 'who', 'first', 'realised', 'people', 'ground', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'fighting', 'lives', 'care', 'much', 'where', 'monster', 'also', 'monster', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'obvious', 'where', 'anyway', 'audience', 'naturally', 'want', 'know', 'where', 'Cloverfield', 'tradition', 'did', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'knowledge', 'more', 'forthcoming', 'Hud', 'friends', 'ARE', 'Hud', 'friends', 'wonder', 'how', 'Hud', 'could', 'be', 'looking', 'viewfinder', 'time', ""n't"", 'early', 'camera', 'transfered', 'clearly', 'strap', 'thing', 'around', 'waist', 'level', 'why', 'shots', 'focus', 'peoples', 'legs', 'feet', 'rather', 'faces.But', 'Cloverfield', 'follow', 'horror', 'monster', 'traditions', 'great', 'effect', 'especially', 'concerning', 'pacing', 'reveal', 'pacing', 'spite', 'certain', 'reviewer', 'comments', 'who', 'simply', 'seem', 'have', 'forgotten', 'quiet', 'moments', 'one', 'naturally', 'are', 'there', 'beautifully', 'handled', 'point', 'when', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'actually', 'went', 'right', 'theater', 'monster', 'strikes', 'then', 'events', 'build', 'climax', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'monster', 'settle', 'back', 'down', 'movie', 'cresting', 'ebbing', 'series', 'ever', 'more', 'horrifying', 'waves', 'always', 'maintaining', 'aspect', 'mystery', 'creature', 'appearance', 'final', 'minutes', 'film', 'glorious', 'monster', 'too', 'knobby', 'hideous', 'alien', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'inspired', 'idea', 'wingless', 'bat', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'really', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'undersea', 'creature', 'anything', 'big', 'lived', 'ocean', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'musculature', 'skeletal', 'structure', 'stand', 'land', 'much', 'less', 'withstand', 'aerial', 'bombing', 'course', 'not', 'point', 'not', 'real', 'anyway.Those', 'who', 'quibble', 'acting', 'characterizations', 'two', 'day', 'growth', 'beard', 'puzzle', 'sure', 'not', 'everyone', 'beard', 'grow', 'weekend', 'plenty', 'do', 'actors', 'were', 'superb', 'parts', 'even', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'had', 'most', 'difficult', 'selling', 'job', 'going', 'back', 'monster', 'rescue', 'girlfriend', 'rather', 'escaping', 'showed', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'conviction', 'cause', 'mixed', 'understanding', 'concern', 'friends', 'situation.Admittedly', 'Cloverfield', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'hated', 'narrative', 'style', 'camerawork', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'then', 'definitely', 'save', 'money', 'shock', 'Alien', 'made', 'think', 'standard', 'horror', 'should', 'aspire', 'then', 'out', 'get', 'Cloverfield', 'now', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'day']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

Substitute a home movie camera and you have Cloverfield, something like 60 years later. I was taken by the Montgomery film (as I was by almost everything that pioneer star of the talkies did) and am quite taken with this one  (despite the absence of any  presence playing in the same league that he did). For the most part, I  think the cast did very well, playing people who were not supposed to be actors, and the filming, as if from a hand held camera, made for very effective viewing.The set-up is simple: a going-away party is being given one of the young (20 something) crowd, on the eve of his departure for Japan for a new job. One of his friends is suckered into being the cameraman, taking statements from attendees on film to be given the man of the hour for future watching. Midway through the party, Manhattan Island (NYc) is attacked by never clearly seen monsters. The remainder of the film is devoted to responses to the attack and attempts to get all the friends to safety.There is little phoney heroics. There are some unlikely actions but,  on the whole, the gimmick works and I was quite pleased with the results.

The big screen experience would have been awful for 2 reasons;1. The infamous shaky cam would have been unbearable.2. Its not good enough to pay theater prices.On the small screen the shaking camera can get annoying but is not such a big deal.  I thought the film was just OK and here's why:-C-C-COOL M-M-MONSTERSWhy monsters are trending towards superfluous limbs, I don't know (see ""The Host"").  Regardless, this beasty is pretty impressive in his (her?) 10 minutes of screen time.  It's in these scenes that the shaky cam is at its most effective.  It looks so real and feels like many nightmares I've had of giant creatures invading my neighborhood.  The parasites you may have heard about (the beasty scrapes them off on buildings like a bear on an oak) are equally terrifying.  In their 5 minutes of screen time, we learn so much about them and what we learn is horrific.  So add it up and you get 15 minutes of monsters.  Not nearly enough, but what we get is pretty darn creepy.-S-S-SILLY P-P-PEOPLEI'm not sure what scared me more; the beasties or spending 55 minutes alone with these stupid people who are passed off as the main characters.  The camera man is a complete dope (though he has genius enough to record everything while keeping his battery alive).  He later develops a personal relationship with the beasty.  The films hero is a whiney drip who risks all for his love; ok, I'll go with it.  I'm not cutting the same slack to his stupid friends though.  Let him go and save his girl, you will only be a hindrance (trust me).  Of course, they can't hear me and they will be sorry!  If you don't believe anyone else then you must believe me; THESE PEOPLE SUCK!!!  We see way too much of them and they are not at all interesting people.  Of course, this lends to the believability of the film.-B-BRIDGES AND B-BUILDINGSThere is a scene on a bridge that is very convincing and very creepy.  It looks all too real.  I have not heard much mention of the actual destruction of New York specifically, but I was impressed with how realistic it looked.  The ruined cityscape in Cloverfield is one of the most convincing I've seen.  There are definitely some redemptive qualities in the effort.-V-V-VERDICTSince I watched the rental, I am considering buying this (when it costs around $6).  The only reason I would buy it would be to see the monsters and some interesting destruction scenes.  I would not care to watch most of the human relationship aspects of this film; they are painfully boring and comprise about 60% of the film.  To the film makers; I have to give credit for the attempt, but don't do it again.-Concept....3 stars-Visual FX..5 stars-Camera.....2 stars-characters.1 starAvarage: 2.75 stars.",3,"C-C-Cool M-M-Monsters, S-S-Silly P-P-People, B-Bridges and B-Buildings",1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,2809,"['how', 'talk', 'camera', 'shaking', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'saw', '37', 'LCD', 'big', 'screen', 'experience', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'awful', '2', 'reasons', '1', 'infamous', 'shaky', 'cam', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unbearable.2', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'pay', 'theater', 'small', 'screen', 'shaking', 'camera', 'can', 'get', 'annoying', 'not', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'OK', 'here', 'why', '-C-C-COOL', 'M-M-MONSTERSWhy', 'monsters', 'are', 'trending', 'towards', 'superfluous', 'limbs', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'see', 'Host', 'Regardless', 'beasty', 'pretty', 'impressive', '10', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'scenes', 'shaky', 'cam', 'most', 'effective', 'so', 'real', 'feels', 'many', 'nightmares', ""'ve"", 'had', 'giant', 'creatures', 'invading', 'neighborhood', 'parasites', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'beasty', 'off', 'buildings', 'bear', 'oak', 'are', 'equally', 'terrifying', '5', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'learn', 'horrific', 'So', 'add', 'up', 'get', '15', 'minutes', 'monsters', 'Not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'what', 'get', 'pretty', 'darn', 'creepy.-S-S-SILLY', 'P-P-PEOPLEI', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'scared', 'more', 'beasties', 'spending', '55', 'minutes', 'alone', 'stupid', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'passed', 'off', 'main', 'characters', 'camera', 'man', 'complete', 'dope', 'genius', 'enough', 'record', 'everything', 'keeping', 'battery', 'alive', 'later', 'personal', 'relationship', 'beasty', 'films', 'hero', 'whiney', 'drip', 'who', 'love', ""'ll"", 'go', ""'m"", 'not', 'cutting', 'same', 'slack', 'stupid', 'friends', 'Let', 'go', 'save', 'girl', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'hindrance', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'will', 'be', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anyone', 'else', 'then', 'must', 'believe', 'THESE', 'PEOPLE', 'SUCK', 'see', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'people', 'course', 'believability', 'film.-B-BRIDGES', 'AND', 'B-BUILDINGSThere', 'scene', 'bridge', 'very', 'convincing', 'very', 'creepy', 'too', 'real', 'have', 'not', 'heard', 'much', 'mention', 'actual', 'destruction', 'New', 'York', 'specifically', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'realistic', 'looked', 'ruined', 'cityscape', 'Cloverfield', 'one', 'most', 'convincing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'are', 'definitely', 'redemptive', 'qualities', 'effort.-V-V-VERDICTSince', 'watched', 'rental', 'am', 'considering', 'buying', 'when', '6', 'only', 'reason', 'would', 'buy', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'monsters', 'interesting', 'destruction', 'scenes', 'would', 'not', 'care', 'watch', 'most', 'human', 'relationship', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'painfully', 'boring', 'comprise', 'about', '60', '%', 'film', 'film', 'makers', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'attempt', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'again.-Concept', '.3', 'stars-Visual', 'FX..5', 'stars-Camera', '..2', 'stars-characters.1', 'starAvarage', '2.75', 'stars']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release
658750,AAG3WH6O2F926,B00005JPXY,Electro,"[3, 8]","Normally I'm not the type of person who enjoys intense films (namely ones intended to scare), but at least in my case I believe Cloverfield was an exceptionally well-done monster movie which both surpassed my expectations and seemed to live up to its hype. The concept of the movie is very entertaining: low-budget camcorders and realistic characters applied to the circumstance of a gigantic spider-like creature having itself a less than casual stroll through NYC. Like many have already said, the way in which the movie was filmed was already used by The Blair Witch Project, but I was glad to see this method used on such a promising premise as Cloverfield has to offer. The shaky camera angles that nauseated a lot of viewers were no trouble for me, and were effective in getting me involved in the intensity and realistic portions of the movie. Unlike the scary movies I've seen and despised in the past, Cloverfield took no cheap shots at my sensitiveness to intense films and thankfully was not full of jump moments or excessively gory. Instead it was oriented around heart-pounding scenes of action and a spontaneous plotline which kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time since I was completely unsure of how the movie would end. As it turned out, the ending was very satisfying in spite of the tragedy of it. I felt very attached to the characters and compelled by the action throughout the film, and when I stepped out of the theater I had a rather unsettling feeling of ""whoa"" (but in a good way). There's really no way to describe it with absolute accuracy for those who haven't seen it, so if you have not yet watched this movie I highly recommend it.

Now here's the scoop.This movie received a fair amount of press so my plot description will be brief. The film follows a group of twenty somethings when the party they are attending is cut short by a monster ravaging New York City. The entire episode is caught on digicam as a number  of the group set out to see if they can rescue the one guy's girlfriend.Most of what people talk about is the jitteriness of the hand-held camera. No question about it, it will help divide the audience. I must say I was mildly annoyed at times, but I can't help but think it might not have been as good were more traditional camera techniques used. You feel like you are there. It DOES evoke many of the same emotions people experienced when they saw the ground-level footage immediately after the 9-11 attacks. When I was young and saw all those wonderfully cheezy Japanese monster movies at the theatre, the camera was always set high so you could see the monster and a lot of buildings. Here you are on the ground and the destruction is raining down around you. It's an eerie feeling.There are other nice touches here as well. What are those smaller creatures dropping from the monster. You're not sure until they appear close up out of the dark and attack like rats. The one character gets bit and you're not sure what the outcome will be, and neither do they until they walk into a military/medical safe-zone where a med-tech sees the girl's been bitten and knows exactly what will happen. I thought this was a clever and deft touch. It widens the scope of the events.I also liked the way the monster is slowly revealed. The producers figured there was no need to hang on the image. A great argument for less is more. I loved the special effects as well. To me they weren't gratuitous. They did the job they were intended to do. The shots of the crumbling city evoked a tremendous amount of emotion in me. It all seemed so real. Once again, I felt I wasn't looking at a movie as much as I was experiencing something first hand.I'm of the school of criticism where movies should be rated within the context of what they are. Yes, this ultimately is a monster movie. These types of movies grab little attention in high circles, but if there were a ""Best Monster Movie"" category in the Academy Awards, this would walk away with a great number of Oscars. For what it is, there are few better.",4,Best of its kind,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,2500,"['had', 'chance', 'see', 'cinema', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'DVD', 'release', 'money', 'owner', 'not', 'renter', 'Now', 'here', 'scoop.This', 'movie', 'received', 'fair', 'amount', 'press', 'plot', 'description', 'will', 'be', 'brief', 'film', 'group', 'twenty', 'somethings', 'when', 'party', 'are', 'attending', 'cut', 'short', 'monster', 'ravaging', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'entire', 'episode', 'caught', 'digicam', 'number', 'group', 'set', 'out', 'see', 'can', 'rescue', 'one', 'guy', 'girlfriend.Most', 'what', 'people', 'talk', 'jitteriness', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'question', 'will', 'help', 'divide', 'audience', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'mildly', 'annoyed', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'were', 'more', 'traditional', 'camera', 'techniques', 'used', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'DOES', 'evoke', 'many', 'same', 'emotions', 'people', 'experienced', 'when', 'saw', 'ground-level', 'footage', 'immediately', '9-11', 'attacks', 'When', 'was', 'young', 'saw', 'wonderfully', 'cheezy', 'Japanese', 'monster', 'movies', 'theatre', 'camera', 'was', 'always', 'set', 'high', 'could', 'see', 'monster', 'lot', 'buildings', 'Here', 'are', 'ground', 'destruction', 'raining', 'down', 'eerie', 'are', 'other', 'nice', 'touches', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'are', 'smaller', 'creatures', 'dropping', 'monster', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'appear', 'close', 'up', 'dark', 'attack', 'rats', 'one', 'character', 'bit', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'outcome', 'will', 'be', 'do', 'walk', 'military/medical', 'safe-zone', 'where', 'med-tech', 'girl', 'been', 'bitten', 'exactly', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'thought', 'was', 'clever', 'deft', 'touch', 'scope', 'events.I', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'monster', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'producers', 'figured', 'was', 'need', 'hang', 'image', 'great', 'argument', 'less', 'more', 'loved', 'special', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'were', ""n't"", 'gratuitous', 'did', 'job', 'were', 'intended', 'do', 'shots', 'crumbling', 'city', 'evoked', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'emotion', 'seemed', 'so', 'real', 'Once', 'again', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'was', 'experiencing', 'something', 'first', 'hand.I', ""'m"", 'school', 'criticism', 'where', 'movies', 'should', 'be', 'rated', 'context', 'what', 'are', 'Yes', 'ultimately', 'monster', 'movie', 'types', 'movies', 'grab', 'little', 'attention', 'high', 'circles', 'were', 'Best', 'Monster', 'Movie', 'category', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'would', 'walk', 'away', 'great', 'number', 'Oscars', 'what', 'are', 'few', 'better']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release
658753,A17IDP37NM8TFJ,B00005JPXY,Eugene Chamson,"[0, 2]","Think ""Blair Witch"" meets ""Godzilla"" meets ""War of the Worlds"".A monster attacks NYC and You Are There... thanks to a group of twenty-something yuppies who happen to be making a home movie when the attack occurs. They leave the camcorder rolling--""to document the event""--while they run for their lives, from one scary gory scene to the next.  Ok, that wouldn't really happen, but hey, this is a sci-fi horror flick, so let's pretend and see where things go...The film is nothing more than the video shot by the characters as the action unfolds.  It's a creative device that provides great realism.  We see events occur from the eyes of those experiencing them, complete with jerky camera movements, as the filmmaker reacts to horrific events.  You really do feel like you are there, with all the fear and shock of living through a nightmare.  Which begs the question:  why would anyone want to see anything like that?  But for those that enjoy films of this genre because they are adrenaline junkies and like to be scared out of their wits, this film will be all that you could want.Yet there are problems with sticking to the camcorder perspective.  First, the camera is poorly operated, meaning all during the film everything is tilted, jerky, blurry, etc.  It's hard to sit through 90 minutes of that.  It's also difficult to get to know, or care about, any of the characters when all you know of them comes from brief poorly-filmed video clips unfolding in real time.  The plot line involves these characters bravely trying to rescue each other and save themselves.  It could have been emotionally powerful, but we feel strangely detached, because we haven't connected with these people and we are watching all the action through distracting camera shots.But the biggest limitation is that we can only ever get a narrow view of what is a grand spectacle, and we can never know more than what the characters know.  Think of it:  a monster is traipsing through Manhattan yet all we can see are glimpses of it through a jerky camera.  As a sci-fi fan, I wanted to know more about the monster:  where did it come from, what were it's intentions, what could the government do against it, etc.  The film tries to compensate for those limitations by allowing the characters to see TV news reports and go up in a helicopter where we get a bird's eye view of the destruction.  But it wasn't enough for me.  My questions were never answered, and I found the ending very unsatisfying.Sci-fi horror films of an era can reflect the collective fears of the time.  During the 50's, it was the Soviet Union, showing up as aliens threatening our way of life.  This film clearly draws inspiration from the attacks of 9/11.  The monster represents our fear of the terrorist threat, arriving without warning and taking aim at symbols of our culture (here, the Statue of Liberty) before trying to destroy everyone and everything for no apparent reason.  In that sense, perhaps the film is merely a reflection of our collective anxiety, and there are no good answers.  If so, then the film succeeds as a realistic and scary portrayal of a nightmarish event.  Still, I would have preferred a more satisfying story.",3,Horror Flick Achieves Realism at the Expense of a Good Story,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,3196,"['Think', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Godzilla', 'War', 'Worlds', '.A', 'monster', 'attacks', 'NYC', 'Are', 'thanks', 'group', 'twenty-something', 'yuppies', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'making', 'home', 'movie', 'when', 'attack', 'leave', 'camcorder', 'rolling', 'document', 'event', 'run', 'lives', 'one', 'scary', 'gory', 'scene', 'next', 'Ok', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'happen', 'hey', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'flick', 'let', 'pretend', 'see', 'where', 'things', 'go', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'video', 'shot', 'characters', 'action', 'creative', 'device', 'great', 'realism', 'see', 'events', 'occur', 'eyes', 'experiencing', 'complete', 'jerky', 'camera', 'movements', 'filmmaker', 'horrific', 'events', 'really', 'do', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'fear', 'shock', 'living', 'nightmare', 'question', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'see', 'anything', 'enjoy', 'films', 'genre', 'are', 'adrenaline', 'junkies', 'like', 'be', 'scared', 'wits', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'could', 'want.Yet', 'are', 'problems', 'sticking', 'camcorder', 'perspective', 'First', 'camera', 'poorly', 'operated', 'meaning', 'film', 'everything', 'tilted', 'jerky', 'blurry', 'etc', 'hard', 'sit', '90', 'minutes', 'also', 'difficult', 'get', 'know', 'care', 'characters', 'when', 'know', 'brief', 'poorly-filmed', 'video', 'clips', 'unfolding', 'real', 'time', 'plot', 'line', 'characters', 'bravely', 'trying', 'rescue', 'other', 'save', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'feel', 'strangely', 'detached', 'have', ""n't"", 'connected', 'people', 'are', 'watching', 'action', 'distracting', 'camera', 'biggest', 'limitation', 'can', 'only', 'ever', 'get', 'narrow', 'view', 'what', 'grand', 'spectacle', 'can', 'never', 'know', 'more', 'what', 'characters', 'know', 'Think', 'monster', 'traipsing', 'Manhattan', 'yet', 'can', 'see', 'are', 'glimpses', 'jerky', 'camera', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'monster', 'where', 'did', 'come', 'what', 'were', 'intentions', 'what', 'could', 'government', 'do', 'etc', 'film', 'tries', 'compensate', 'limitations', 'allowing', 'characters', 'see', 'TV', 'news', 'reports', 'go', 'up', 'helicopter', 'where', 'get', 'bird', 'eye', 'view', 'destruction', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'questions', 'were', 'never', 'answered', 'found', 'ending', 'very', 'unsatisfying.Sci-fi', 'horror', 'films', 'era', 'can', 'reflect', 'collective', 'fears', 'time', '50', 'was', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'showing', 'up', 'aliens', 'threatening', 'way', 'life', 'film', 'clearly', 'draws', 'inspiration', 'attacks', '9/11', 'monster', 'fear', 'terrorist', 'threat', 'arriving', 'warning', 'taking', 'aim', 'symbols', 'culture', 'here', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'trying', 'destroy', 'everyone', 'everything', 'apparent', 'reason', 'sense', 'perhaps', 'film', 'merely', 'reflection', 'collective', 'anxiety', 'are', 'good', 'answers', 'so', 'then', 'film', 'realistic', 'scary', 'portrayal', 'nightmarish', 'event', 'Still', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'more', 'satisfying', 'story']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

658757,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B00005JPXY,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[3, 5]","Going into Cloverfield, I was incredibly curious. Would I vomit from the camera? Could this monster be the next Godzilla? Could a movie work with NO stars? Could J. J. Abrams flop in the face of hype again? To answer those in order: No, Doubtfully, Yes, No. In fact, I think this movie is an instant classic that isn't afraid to turn Hollywood rules on its head. What Abrams and company do is take the old premise of monster in NYC and take it from a whole new Point of View. And POV is what this movie is all about.Main Camera Man Hud is obviously not good with the camera, as seen in the beginning, compared with Jason's camera work. Being from the younger demographic, this shaky-cam doesn't phase me at all, since I am probably used to YouTube effect. And let me say, if you thought Hud's camera work was bad, you should see mine. Nobody would have made it out of the theater without falling down in a dizzy drunken stupor. So anyways, while we're used to the normal omniscient camera style of the all-seeing-eye, seeing everything, this style does have its advantages. It provides the film's best ""Oh Crap!"" moment in the tunnel, when they turn on night vision.The bad thing about this style is the fact that it's very hard to keep up with the camera, and everything going around. So, it's kind of hard to tell which person is dying, and who is alive. It didn't help any that both Beth and Lizzy were both brunettes. So, it took me awhile to figure out what happened on the Brooklyn Bridge, who was put into the helicopter first, and who was with Rob at the very end. I also didn't know that Lizzy's helicopter went down. But thankfully, there's Wikipedia to give you a scene-by-scene summery of the movie's events.I also liked the little touch where everytime the camera was turned off, you had the little moment's of Rob and Beth's Coney Island date. Not much, but it just seems to strangely work in the movie, and gives a nice break to the action going on around.Speaking of action, it's pretty darn good for a movie made on the budget of most romantic comedies. The suspense and action keeps you on your toes, and there's plenty of cringe moments that keeps the mood all the more intense. Although I really could have done without the exploding stomach and the rescue of the impaled girl. But I thank the movie for being restrained, since they could have easily gone into R-Territory, which would have made the whole film a cheesy horror film. Oh yeah, it would be ""The Blair Witch Project.""Let me also say that the famous/infamous Statue of Liberty head in the streets scene, will go down as one of the classic Hollywood scenes. I mean, the scene is just so classic. Head flying down and rolling down in the streets. The Shock. The ""OH MY GOD!"" being repeated over and over. The Surprise. Total classic.For being a no-star movie, everybody in the cast does an excellent job. There's no bad acting, no fake acting, all the emotions seem real, and in fact, these actors do a better job than their more famous counterparts would do. And for a lack of character development, I liked most of the characters in the movie, and when I could tell that they just died, I was saddened by their loss. Except for Marlena, who I didn't get the appeal of.However, when it came to Hud, I was deeply saddened by his loss. Maybe it's because I'm a fan of T.J. Miller since he stole the show on the now cancelled Carpoolers. The guy is just likable, and he brings his personality to Hud. Alas, this brings me to  my next complaint.Why did Hud have to die? I mean, he just seems to be cheapened when he's eaten by the creature, just for the sake of us getting a facial glimpse of the monster. I would have liked it if Hud was like the only survivor, and found a way to escape operation ""Hammer Down."" Sure, incredibly unlikely, but still. Instead, the film ends up a bit depressing, since basically every character you've met during the course of the film, is dead. And the monster seems to still be alive. Yet, it's nice to see the profession of love at the end, and it again, strangely seems to work.But for all of that, you also have to add the realism of the entire thing. I mean, if a monster like that were really to attack NYC (highly unlikely), that's probably how it would take place. And most importantly, these seemed like real characters, not cardboard cutouts of twenty-somethings.So overall, for it's realism, originality, execution, characters, and premise, this movie earns the title of ""Instant Classic."" It defines a era that is 2008, where terrorism is the first thing you think of when a major disaster happens, the YouTube/Camera Phone culture and just society in general. It's the little things that make the movie more than the big things, and they work in unexpected ways. Sure, I would have probably changed a couple of things, but it all seems to work. As for the rumor of sequels, I'm a bit hesitant, as is the crew, because you really need a new gimmick, as this has already been done. And quite well I might add.",5,"""People Are Gonna Want To Know...

Ortega ""Michael Ortega""","[3, 5]","Cloverfield: The Monster from the InternetIt's been over a week since I took my wife and kids to see Cloverfield at the local cineplex. My wife, who is generally hard to please, liked it. But, she thought the shaky hand held camera work detracted from the overall experience. Both my pre teen children loved it. They seemed generally terrified at all the right parts and ate their popcorn in a most hypnotic manner. My reaction was only slightly more nuanced. I liked the movie, but I just felt like there was too much missing.My biggest complaint is the camerawork. All the jerky movements and blurred shots got old after the first five minutes. I was bored to tears watching poorly shot asphalt and off kilter shots of running feet. Let's face it, it's a gimmick. The subpar cinematography does not enhance the theatre going experience.The plot of Cloverfield (or what passes for a plot) revolves around an extremely attractive group of twenty-somethings who brave impossible odds to rescue the male lead's ex-girlfriend. In a major suspension of belief, they head towards the center of the city as a gigantic mutant ravages New York, eating people and knocking down skyscrapers.This brings me to my next point. Cloverfield's script borders on incoherence because it explains nothing. And, believe it or not, this is what fascinates me the most about this movie.The main plot points and explanations do not exist in the movie. They exist on the internet.The producers of Cloverfield have set up a series of internet sites that provide the answers to most of the questions posed in the film. Now these sites all fit into the mythos that the makers of Cloverfield have created. The sites include on line comic books, fake Japanese corporations, soft drink ads and more.  If you visit all these sites and take in all the content provided therein the movie will suddenly come into focus. This is ironic considering how out of focus the actual movie is.The producers of Cloverfield have taken the ""Blair Witch"" concept and taken it up a notch.This is not a film release in the classical sense...this is a true multi media event taking full advantage of the internet. Maybe that's why it is hard for me to like this film. It takes personal time and investment to truly appreciate it. You can't just sit in the theatre and watch the movie, not if you want to understand what's going on. You have to research it. You have to invest time and effort outside of the movie going experience.It has become clear just how conflicted I am regarding this movie. After visiting the connected internet sites I now understand the movie and what it's about. So I'm enjoying the movie more after the fact. I'll leave it up to you to decide whether or not that's a good thing.So in the end I will give Cloverfield 4 stars out of five. The film deserves that rating if nothing else for the sheer innovation of its packaging.",3,I saw it in the theatre but have not purchased the DVD,1207785600,"04 10, 2008",2008,2902,"['Cloverfield', 'Monster', 'InternetIt', 'been', 'week', 'took', 'wife', 'kids', 'see', 'Cloverfield', 'local', 'cineplex', 'My', 'wife', 'who', 'generally', 'hard', 'please', 'liked', 'thought', 'shaky', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'work', 'detracted', 'overall', 'experience', 'pre', 'teen', 'children', 'loved', 'seemed', 'generally', 'terrified', 'right', 'parts', 'ate', 'popcorn', 'most', 'hypnotic', 'manner', 'reaction', 'was', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'nuanced', 'liked', 'movie', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'missing.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'camerawork', 'jerky', 'movements', 'blurred', 'shots', 'got', 'old', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'was', 'bored', 'tears', 'watching', 'poorly', 'shot', 'asphalt', 'kilter', 'shots', 'running', 'feet', 'Let', 'face', 'gimmick', 'subpar', 'cinematography', 'not', 'enhance', 'theatre', 'going', 'experience.The', 'plot', 'Cloverfield', 'what', 'plot', 'extremely', 'attractive', 'group', 'twenty-somethings', 'who', 'brave', 'impossible', 'odds', 'rescue', 'male', 'lead', 'ex-girlfriend', 'major', 'suspension', 'belief', 'head', 'center', 'city', 'gigantic', 'mutant', 'New', 'York', 'eating', 'people', 'knocking', 'down', 'skyscrapers.This', 'brings', 'next', 'point', 'Cloverfield', 'script', 'borders', 'incoherence', 'nothing', 'believe', 'not', 'what', 'most', 'movie.The', 'main', 'plot', 'points', 'explanations', 'do', 'not', 'exist', 'movie', 'exist', 'internet.The', 'producers', 'Cloverfield', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'series', 'internet', 'sites', 'provide', 'answers', 'most', 'questions', 'posed', 'film', 'Now', 'sites', 'fit', 'mythos', 'makers', 'Cloverfield', 'have', 'created', 'sites', 'include', 'line', 'comic', 'books', 'fake', 'Japanese', 'corporations', 'soft', 'drink', 'ads', 'more', 'visit', 'sites', 'take', 'content', 'provided', 'therein', 'movie', 'will', 'suddenly', 'come', 'focus', 'ironic', 'considering', 'how', 'focus', 'actual', 'movie', 'is.The', 'producers', 'Cloverfield', 'have', 'taken', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'concept', 'taken', 'up', 'notch.This', 'not', 'film', 'release', 'classical', 'sense', 'true', 'multi', 'media', 'event', 'taking', 'full', 'advantage', 'internet', 'why', 'hard', 'like', 'film', 'personal', 'time', 'investment', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'sit', 'theatre', 'watch', 'movie', 'not', 'want', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'have', 'research', 'have', 'invest', 'time', 'effort', 'movie', 'going', 'experience.It', 'become', 'clear', 'just', 'how', 'conflicted', 'am', 'regarding', 'movie', 'visiting', 'connected', 'internet', 'sites', 'now', 'understand', 'movie', 'what', 'about', ""'m"", 'enjoying', 'movie', 'more', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'up', 'decide', 'not', 'good', 'thing.So', 'end', 'will', 'give', 'Cloverfield', '4', 'stars', 'five', 'film', 'rating', 'nothing', 'else', 'sheer', 'innovation', 'packaging']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

First of all, the annoyance of watching almost the entire movie from the view of a home movie video camera shaking all over the place.

Second, the first half hour takes place at a party some people are throwing for a friend that is moving away, and you are just viewing and listening to boring conversation among them.  Then enters the monster.  You get no idea where it came from, why it's there, and then where did it finally go?  It's even insinuated that it was there before, yet it's as big as the buildings (in the Big Apple?!?).  Maybe it had been hibernating in the bottom of the harbor for a thousand years??

I must say, If I were to see a monster like that coming at me, I am running the OTHER way!  Anything good about this movie?  Yes.

Aside from the oppressive heat,  some things I remember vividly are the fire ant mounds that would infest our property.  One of my chores as a teenager was to break them up and pour poison into them.I occasionally wondered how the tiny creatures felt as they watched a giant invader, huge beyond their comprehension, destroying their carefully built tunnels and raining death down on them.Not that they didn't fight back; they launched waves of their best warriors against me.  But their poisonous bites were to me nothing more than irritating stings, and I was all the more gleeful in my annihilation of them because of the minor pain they caused me.I now know how the little devils felt.Cloverfield is a film about a young, hip group of Manhattanites whose world is demolished by a monster that lumbers beside skyscrapers, almost matching many of them in height.  We learn little about this beast, other than it's very big, very tough, and very, very pissed.  The military tosses tons of conventional firepower against it, but it just keeps coming.  In fact, in one scene that must have been a nod to Godzilla, we see the creature's foot step on a tank, crushing it like a tin can.Making the situation worse are a horde of smaller critters, about the size of large dogs, that have invaded the city as well.  Watch out, don't let them bite!  As one character found out, the results can be explosive.I won't give any major plot details, but be warned: things don't end happyfor our friends, who are recording all of this on their trusty camcorder.Also, the question of whether the monster is ultimately slain or not remains open, as do queries about its origin and nature.  Like so many of life's tragedies (car crashes, cancer, etc.) the beast comes without reason, without mercy, and without escape.I think this is one reason for the movie's popularity: it taps into the fears we all have that terrible events will unravel the fragile security of our lives and rob us of all we hold precious and sacred.The utter lack of resolution is the reason I dinged the film one star.  This movie cries out for a sequel, or at least some explanations from its creators.  In the absence of certainty speculation abounds, however, and I offer some below for interested parties:During the movie Hud mentions the possibility that the monster came from an ocean trench, and I think this a strong possibility.  It did, after all, rise from the sea.Also, its extremely tough hide and near-invulnerability to bombs and bullets could be due to its having to withstand the tremendous pressures it would deal with on the ocean's bottom.It obviously breathes air, indicating it probably uses some gill/lung double system.  It also suggests that the military would have been better off forgetting the tanks, bombs, etc. and just nerve-gassing it.The mini-monsters that plague the city were, in my opinion, the giant's equivalent of lice, hair mites, etc.  Just as we have tiny bugs that hitch a ride with us in our follicles, lashes, skin, etc., so does it.  My good wife suggested the possibility that they were the critter's offspring, dropped across the city so they could grow up to be just like mom.  Now that's a scary thought.End of speculation.  But I do have one more thing to say.  I had no trouble watching this movie, and I hate roller coasters.  The remarks about its jerky quality were, to me, vastly overblown.  It does come across as something shot by a terrified amateur film maker who is fleeing for his life, but, hey, that's exactly what it's supposed to be, so what's the problem?Highly recommended for horror, monster and SF fans - or anyone who likes a good scare.",4,Now I know how those ants felt,1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,3809,"['WARNING', 'MINOR', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEADAnyone', 'who', 'Hell', 'should', 'visit', 'place', 'grew', 'up', 'southern', 'Georgia', 'month', 'August', 'Aside', 'oppressive', 'heat', 'things', 'remember', 'vividly', 'are', 'fire', 'ant', 'would', 'infest', 'property', 'One', 'chores', 'teenager', 'was', 'break', 'up', 'pour', 'poison', 'them.I', 'occasionally', 'wondered', 'how', 'tiny', 'creatures', 'felt', 'watched', 'giant', 'invader', 'huge', 'comprehension', 'destroying', 'carefully', 'built', 'tunnels', 'raining', 'death', 'down', 'them.Not', 'did', ""n't"", 'fight', 'back', 'launched', 'waves', 'best', 'warriors', 'poisonous', 'bites', 'were', 'nothing', 'more', 'irritating', 'stings', 'was', 'more', 'gleeful', 'annihilation', 'minor', 'pain', 'caused', 'me.I', 'now', 'know', 'how', 'little', 'devils', 'felt.Cloverfield', 'film', 'young', 'hip', 'group', 'Manhattanites', 'world', 'demolished', 'monster', 'skyscrapers', 'almost', 'matching', 'many', 'height', 'learn', 'little', 'beast', 'other', 'very', 'big', 'very', 'tough', 'very', 'very', 'pissed', 'military', 'tosses', 'tons', 'conventional', 'firepower', 'just', 'coming', 'fact', 'one', 'scene', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'nod', 'Godzilla', 'see', 'creature', 'foot', 'step', 'tank', 'crushing', 'tin', 'can.Making', 'situation', 'worse', 'are', 'horde', 'smaller', 'critters', 'size', 'large', 'dogs', 'have', 'invaded', 'city', 'as', 'well', 'Watch', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'bite', 'one', 'character', 'found', 'out', 'results', 'can', 'be', 'explosive.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'major', 'plot', 'details', 'be', 'warned', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'happyfor', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'recording', 'trusty', 'camcorder.Also', 'question', 'monster', 'ultimately', 'slain', 'not', 'open', 'do', 'queries', 'origin', 'nature', 'so', 'many', 'life', 'tragedies', 'car', 'crashes', 'cancer', 'etc', 'beast', 'reason', 'mercy', 'escape.I', 'think', 'one', 'reason', 'movie', 'popularity', 'fears', 'have', 'terrible', 'events', 'will', 'unravel', 'fragile', 'security', 'lives', 'rob', 'hold', 'precious', 'sacred.The', 'utter', 'lack', 'resolution', 'reason', 'dinged', 'film', 'one', 'star', 'movie', 'out', 'sequel', 'least', 'explanations', 'creators', 'absence', 'certainty', 'speculation', 'abounds', 'however', 'offer', 'interested', 'parties', 'movie', 'Hud', 'possibility', 'monster', 'came', 'ocean', 'trench', 'think', 'strong', 'possibility', 'did', 'rise', 'sea.Also', 'extremely', 'tough', 'hide', 'near-invulnerability', 'bombs', 'bullets', 'could', 'be', 'due', 'having', 'withstand', 'tremendous', 'pressures', 'would', 'deal', 'ocean', 'bottom.It', 'obviously', 'air', 'indicating', 'probably', 'gill/lung', 'double', 'system', 'also', 'military', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'forgetting', 'tanks', 'bombs', 'etc', 'just', 'nerve-gassing', 'it.The', 'mini-monsters', 'plague', 'city', 'were', 'opinion', 'giant', 'equivalent', 'lice', 'hair', 'mites', 'etc', 'Just', 'have', 'tiny', 'bugs', 'hitch', 'ride', 'follicles', 'lashes', 'skin', 'etc.', 'so', 'good', 'wife', 'suggested', 'possibility', 'were', 'critter', 'offspring', 'dropped', 'city', 'could', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'just', 'mom', 'Now', 'scary', 'thought.End', 'speculation', 'do', 'have', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'say', 'had', 'trouble', 'watching', 'movie', 'hate', 'roller', 'coasters', 'remarks', 'jerky', 'quality', 'were', 'vastly', 'overblown', 'come', 'something', 'shot', 'terrified', 'amateur', 'film', 'maker', 'who', 'fleeing', 'life', 'hey', 'exactly', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'what', 'problem', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'horror', 'monster', 'SF', 'fans', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'scare']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

658767,A1U6XPYATU9OPG,B00005JPXY,G. Denick,"[0, 0]","J.J. Abrams was inspired to create the story of Cloverfield while visiting Japan, and witnessing the fervent love that the culture had for its national monster, Godzilla. In that regard, I feel that he has succeeded, which is why I am rating this movie five stars. The Clover monster is an awe-inspiring, rampaging beastie that lays waste to NYC with grand aplomb, and is of such size and stature that it could have been ripped straight from the Cluthu mythos of H.P. Lovecraft. I loved the monster's design (a touch of which can be seen in the creature from ""Super 8"", another Abrams creation), and the way that it was sparingly revealed, one brief glimpse at a time (with CGI done right, mind you). But rather than copping out and leaving the monster's true form to the audience's imagination, Cloverfield swings for the fences, delivering a full reveal in the film's finale. In my opinion, this reveal was a success, which was difficult to achieve, given all the (extraordinarily well done hype) that preceded this movie's arrival. Those who are curious as to the monster's origins can scour the found footage (and internet) for clues, which is a great touch.I feel that the major complaint with Cloverfield is that the characters are too annoying to empathize with. While this is certainly true, I don't think that Abrams ever intended for us to empathize with them... we're supposed to empathize with the monster, who is lost and scared, and simply lashing out in this new environment full of things that seek to hurt him.

I get that it's supposed to be some real live amateur filming of the attack, but it could have been a little more polished.  I got dizzy a few times.  It reminded me of all those YouTube videos where people are recording concerts while jumping up and down. Also, I've seen Blair Witch (you know it'll get compared to it), so this type of filming isn't foreign to me, but in Cloverfield, it was extra distracting.  And my goodness, that camera was stronger than Jack Bauer's cell phone--and we know that battery has yet to really die.Aside from the technical stuff, it was just a boring movie with bad acting. I can appreciate a good viral campaign like every other business major, but at least have something to back it up. You know it's bad when you have no clue what the monster is, but you're just praying that it stomps all the main characters. Bad acting (what's the going rate for an actor that can say ""Oh my G-d!"" over and over?) accompanied by a lame script (does a movie like this really require the guy/girl drama?).Cloverfield is simply a weak movie. I don't mind a movie where you have a monster or some crazy happenings and you can't quite figure out why (The Birds is classic, heck so is Tremors for that matter), but Cloverfield just missed so many marks.It'll be on Starz eventually, so just hold off and save your money.",1,Lame.

I know that the purpose of shaky cam is to add realism and involve the audience but in this film, it was very distracting. Distracting to the point where my head was beginning to ache from the constant wobbling and swaying in all the shots. The constant squealing and ""oh my gods"" in my ear did not help either. Also, the constant jerking of the camera combined with the dark lighting meant that any semi exciting event was just ""blink and you'll miss it"".2. The characters. I wasn't expecting any characterization or interesting dialogue to occur given the scenario but if your life is in danger, no one would huddle in groups on the street crying, ""oh my god oh god oh god"". They would be trying to survive! In my opinion, a good action/thriller is driven by a balance between common sense and emotion within the character. In this film, the main characters were too melodramatic and emotional. There's a scene where they hear sounds behind them and instead of sprinting in the opposite direction quietly, they turn TWICE and just stand there listening to it while 2 of them flap around with the night vision on the camera.

It may be artsy in some peoples' minds to film movies of people filming movies with a camcorder, but that was already badly done in Blair Witch, and it's even more badly done in this one (believe it).The acting was less than awful, but the plot and storyline were boring and unbelievable even within the genre. The movie leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Why in a country the size of the US, do monsters always attack NY? Why do they never attack places like Idaho? Hasn't the filmmaking industry put NY through enough? Why doesn't the guy doing the filming put down the camera and help his friends? Why doesn't the battery in the camera die? What brand of camera is this? I need one of them. Why do bridges never get destroyed by monsters when no one is on them? Why do historic monuments always get destroyed? Do aliens and monsters really prefer those over all the rundown buildings, even in NY?The Blair Witch Project at least had an interesting plot even if the movie itself was bad. There is nothing redeeming in Cloverfield. It's one of those movies that don't just leave you wondering if you can get your money back, but instead wondering if you can receive punitive damages for the nausea and the time you wasted watching it.According to Amazon, people who bought this movie also bought The Mist.

Some also said a lot of things were not explained. Here's my 2+2 cents on Cloverfield. Well, I just finished watching the dvd and I must say I'm amazed. For the idea of Cloverfield alone, the film should get a lot of recognition. I liked this more than I liked 28 Days later and the sequel. This is modern cinema at it's best. I loved the characters esp the person who's taking the video. He stayed true to his character and not so much the drama element involved in tragedies. (""no camcorder advertising"" was done)Cloverfield a huge risk taken by the film-makers and I must say naysayers can whine for all their mouth but Cloverfield shuts everyone up and delivers. Another thing I loved about the film is that it's barely 80 minutes you know. I read so many negative reviews of this film but I must say the film is truly one of the better films I've seen in 2008. In 2010, when I'm watching 2008 films, I will still look back at this film and say Wow.If you liked War of the Worlds, there is no way you can dislike this. It doesn't even have that irritating little girl screaming her mouth off. It has rats running for shelter, it has bridges collapsing, it has fire, it has sky, F16s, honest believable humor and flirting skills, it has 6.42 AM and mineral water.I doubt I'll want to watch the ever so cheesy Transformer films again.",4,"Naysayers can crib, this film truly delivers",1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,1427,"['Cloverfield', 'got', 'lot', 'heat', 'viewers', 'said', 'camera', 'made', 'dizzy', 'also', 'said', 'lot', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'explained', 'Here', '2+2', 'cents', 'Cloverfield', 'Well', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'dvd', 'must', 'say', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'idea', 'Cloverfield', 'alone', 'film', 'should', 'get', 'lot', 'recognition', 'liked', 'more', 'liked', '28', 'Days', 'later', 'sequel', 'modern', 'cinema', 'best', 'loved', 'characters', 'esp', 'person', 'who', 'taking', 'video', 'stayed', 'true', 'character', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'drama', 'element', 'involved', 'tragedies', 'camcorder', 'advertising', 'was', 'done', 'Cloverfield', 'huge', 'risk', 'taken', 'film-makers', 'must', 'say', 'naysayers', 'can', 'whine', 'mouth', 'Cloverfield', 'shuts', 'everyone', 'up', 'delivers', 'thing', 'loved', 'film', 'barely', '80', 'minutes', 'know', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'film', 'truly', 'one', 'better', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2008', '2010', 'when', ""'m"", 'watching', '2008', 'films', 'will', 'still', 'look', 'back', 'film', 'say', 'Wow.If', 'liked', 'War', 'Worlds', 'way', 'can', 'dislike', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'irritating', 'little', 'girl', 'screaming', 'mouth', 'rats', 'running', 'shelter', 'bridges', 'collapsing', 'fire', 'sky', 'F16s', 'honest', 'believable', 'humor', 'flirting', 'skills', '6.42', 'AM', 'mineral', 'water.I', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'ever', 'so', 'cheesy', 'Transformer', 'films', 'again']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

658781,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00005JPXY,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 7]","Basically, this monster flick is a bonafide summer extravaganza masquerading as a wintertime release. And, yes, it's eardrum-busting loud and special effects heavy, but, amazingly CLOVERFIELD also has its deep waters. At a frenetic hour and a half, this film of survival in the face of the unthinkable doesn't have time to get mired in big-budgetism or blockbusteritis. So what we get instead is a taut and compelling pseudo-documentary style monster movie. Kind of. That's actually the backdrop. The film actually is more a focused story on a group of young people attempting to live thru a cataclysmic and unfathomable event. And that's the blessed key right there. CLOVERFIELD doesn't forget about the people, makes you pull for them to come thru okay, makes you all caught up in the throat when they don't. Least it did me.The film opens innocently enough as a group of young Manhattanites throw a farewell party for their friend, who's spending his last night in New York before he jets out to Japan for his new gig. The next 15 minutes or so clue us in with relevant scenes as we get to know the main characters and what's important to them. But, soon enough, news on television begin to cover an oil tanker just capsized in the New York harbor, and that's the start of it. Then comes the tremor, followed by a power outage. If you've caught the trailer, then you've seen folks scampering out to the roof, then pouring out into the streets, where the crap truly hits the fan.""People are gonna wanna know how it all went down,"" declares the goofy would-be documentator as he holds fast to his buddy's camcorder and records the next several harrowing hours. It is thru this camcorder that we see this movie, treating us to a ground's eye view of the mounting panic and confusion and noise and fear and just the utter destruction left in the wake of the rampaging whatever-it-is. Because of the camcorder device, raw and shaky and frenetic, and utilized amateurishly enough to be realistic, there's an element of credibility which curtails the cheese factor of a typical monster movie. There's certainly a sense of immediacy here, and a decided impact felt. Bridges collapse, buildings topple, the head of the Statue of Liberty caroms off the side of an edifice, hurtling onto a crowded street. The military do their best, but don't fare too well. And there are other worrisome things out there to fret about, as evidenced by a frightening sequence in the subway tunnels. Reduced to witnessing events at a street level vantage point, pressed in squarely with the frantic victims and onlookers, a palpable feeling of helplessness and insignificance sinks in.CLOVERFIELD is a disaster movie as experienced thru the eyes of a young group of friends, never mind that the disaster is an unnatural one. No over-the-top heroics here by the cast, no vanquishing the behemoth or saving the city. Situations like this, the things that matter are quickly become well-defined. These Manhattanites are no world savers. They're mere mortals, concerned with personal survival and the survival of their loved ones. The brunt of the plot involves one character who means to brave the warzone to rescue a trapped loved one. His friends are loyal enough to accompany him. And because the movie takes the time to establish its cast, we're right there with them.Several SPOILERS follow.Exceptional CG work, of course, with most of the pretend stuff focusing on the wrack and ruin of Manhattan. And how does the monster look? Well, for most of CLOVERFIELD, there are only fleeting peeks at the raging monster, a tail here, a few limbs there, then a blurry shot of what might be the monster's head. Not until almost near the film's end do we get a close-up look of the big honking creature. This is all good, as, personally, the film-long tease ratcheted the suspense way up. I also liked that there wasn't an explanation provided for the monster, what it is, where it came from, all that. And when the closing credits roll around, we're left in the dark regarding the big picture. Was the monster ever vanquished? We know parts of New York are thoroughly devastated, as indicated by the film's introductory on-screen text. But I like that I might never find out. Meanwhile, now and then, we glimpse cutaway sequences of a happier time in the lead character's life (recorded on the same tape in the camcorder). These provide brief and bittersweet counterpoints to all the terror and is a reminder that, despite the f/x and the cool concept and the awesome featured creature, it's the moments of humanity in the film which keeps us invested, and sometimes on a visceral level. Go see this one.And if you end up enjoying CLOVERFIELD, you might also want to giveThe Host (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)a go.",4,The worst going away party EVER!,1200614400,"01 18,

658792,A319SKSB556033,B00005JPXY,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[0, 0]","Only once in a rare while are we treated to a movie so innovative and unique. It's sad to think that there will only be so many film-going experiences like Cloverfield in my life while the void is filled with more generic fare. In terms of story it is very similar to the awful 1998 clunkerGodzilla [Blu-ray], but is a world apart when it comes to execution thanks toUnder Siege 2 - Dark Territory [Blu-ray] scribe Matt Reeves' highly kinetic direction.Everyone by now knows the premise of the filming of a loft party being interrupted by the arrival of a giant monster in Manhattan, so I won't go into loads of description over that. I'm a firm believer in the fact that the camera is the eyes of the person watching the film and with Cloverfield (likeThe Blair Witch Projectbefore it) we are put right into the central character's shoes as he stumbles around the darkest corners of the city with his ever diminishing group of friends.It's been repeated a million times, but I too believe that what we DON'T see is scarier than what we do. Once you bring the monster out of the shadows all the mystery and fear evaporates. For the majority of the movie we never really get to see all of the monster, perhaps a tentacle here or a foot there, but not much of the whole thing. We do get to see a lot of the ugly parasites that cling to its body however.There are some brilliant and eternally memorable scenes in Cloverfield, the best being hard to nail down but I loved the idea of entering a crooked skyscraper via the deserted tower that it's leaning against. What a truly unique set-piece.Of course the movie is going to have it's critics and there will be plenty who are not satisfied with the ending. JJ Abrams has said that he plans to do a single sequel from another point of view, but I feel this will ruin the magic.In fact, JJ Abrams' marketing campaign and back-story has already tarnished the film for me a little bit. He has stated that the monster comes from the sea but I prefer to not know for certain where it comes from. I imagined it coming from outer space myself as the idea of a random creature arriving from the infinite darkness of space to far more terrifying than a monster from the limited environment of our own oceans. And the viral marketing is way out of hand. Let me put set it all straight.Rob Hawkins has been made vice president of a company in Japan. That company is the Slusho soft drink firm. Marlena is seen drinking plenty of Slusho at the beginning of the film. The parasites on the creature apparently eat the secret ingredient of Slusho deep in the ocean. They smelled this on her, which explains why she is the only one of the group who is bitten. The near-unnoticeable 'splash' in the water at the end of the film is part of a satellite which has fallen out of space and apparently wakes up the monster somehow.What a load of garbage! Is Rob Hawkins the center of the universe or something? Why is all this contrived crap revolving around him? Why they came up with this drivel instead of leaving it all unexplained is beyond me. Nevertheless, I will still be looking forward to the sequel next year.The Blu Ray features a brilliant 1080p 1.78:1 picture with Dolby TrueHD and loads of extras.

658796,A21XG7UVD2ABKS,B00005JPXY,Jack R. Tallent,"[12, 16]","""Cloverfield"" is not only much better than I was expecting, it is, in fact, an extremely clever, well-executed, and scary movie. Kudos to the team that produced this film, as it could have gone wrong in so many ways.Without providing spoilers, I will describe the premise of ""Cloverfield"" as follows: what if a monster movie were real? Now, that may seem like a trivial premise, because any work of fiction attempts to create a sense of reality. But think about it: there are fictional movies about ""real stuff"" (i.e. Howard's End, The Right Stuff, To Kill a Mockingbird, etc.) and there are fictional movies about ""not-real stuff"" (i.e. Godzilla, Star Wars, Fahrenheit 911, etc.) Well, what if there were a monster in a ""real stuff"" movie? The effect would be, and is, quite unsettling, and this is what ""Cloverfield"" attempts, through the device of an unedited home movie that presents, in large part, the mundane material of which most such movies are made.For this reason, ""Cloverfield"" reminds me a bit of Shyamalan's ""Signs"", which I felt attempted to do the very same thing (and which was also very effective). It also reminded me of Stephen King's ""The Mist"" (the novella, not the movies) mostly due to the nightmarish collision of unreality and reality that both share.One thing that impressed me is that the device used in the film could have easily become contrived or gimmicky if not handled with extreme finesse; everything was spot on. I found myself grinning as the film really got going, enjoying what the filmmakers were doing. The grinning soon went away, as the movie is actually pretty scary.""Cloverfield"" leaves you wanting more, and with many questions unanswered. (Although, as with other J.J. Abrams works, some answers are there if you look closely enough...)

Something about the head of the Statue of Liberty rolling down the streets of Manhattan had me hooked. More importantly I couldn't wait to find out what exactly was causing this carnage. So it was with great expectations I strapped myself in for what was sure to be an incredible ride.Now I could go on and on here about who the cast is but you would have no idea who I'm talking about. That's one of the things that really make this film work. There are no mega-stars on screen threatening to steal the spotlight from the story. I'm a huge fan of J.J. Abrams' work thanks to both Alias and Lost, so I was excited that he produced the movie. Everything he touches lately seems to turn to gold and this movie is certainly no exception.The story is actually very simple. The entire film is shot from a hand-held camera giving us the point of view of a small group of friends who are trying to get out of New York. As the story unfolds we learn that a monster is destroying the city and the military is called in to stop the beast and evacuate the citizens. As these friends try to flee for safety, they unwillingly find themselves closer to danger.This is not a film that offers answers and explanations, but rather we are only exposed to the minimal knowledge these friends have. They don't care where this monster came from or how it can be stopped. All they want to do is get out alive and help each other get there. I've read several reviews where people hated this aspect of the movie, but I have to admit it really worked for me. I love when filmmakers and writers think outside the box and Cloverfield is an excellent example.The special effects and production value are top-notch and I found myself constantly wondering how they filmed certain scenes. This is one movie that will really immerse you into the experience and several times I had to remind myself to breathe because of the intensity. The subway scene in particular is breathtaking and wonderfully terrifying.There are lots of reports out about the jerky camera shots causing people to feel nauseous. Unfortunately, I can testify that this is indeed true. Whatever the condition is called, I have it. Several times I found myself having to look away from the screen because of the motion sickness I felt.

Let's do away with the current wave of sadistic torture horror movies and replace it with Kaigu - Giant monsters. I promise you will like this movie.

658799,A2MZEL71YTFJFX,B00005JPXY,James,"[16, 23]","This is by far the most over-hyped movie I've seen ever. No wonder they made this movie mysterious in the beginning of last year. There's no real story here. I thought this movie was going to be a spin off of Lost series after the SWAN hatch imploded at the end of season 2 possibly releasing a part of the ""Black Smoke Monster"". A lot of other Lost fans thought so also. But I highly doubt that. It's just another re-hashed monster flick where some giant creature trashes Manhattan Island. Instead of the perspective of Army and Marine grunts, Air Force pilots, and scientists, it takes the perspective of a bunch of young yuppie New Yorkers as they try to survive the monster and fight off it's bug like minions They're probably like remoras on sharks or small birds on rhinos. We don't get an explanation of what the monster is or what its little bug looking minions are doing when they bite someone. The monster doesn't even look like the old Japanese Godzilla or the new American Godzilla from 1998. It's not H.P. Lovecraft's Call of Cthulhu or Voltron. Everyone has seen this type Monster movie before. There's nothing new in this film. It'll probably end up in the Svengoolie show on Saturday night. So don't waste your money on this movie in the weekend. In the later half of the movie after we discover that it was indeed a monster, I was rooting for it to eat the people up, bite their heads off, and tear up the L-trains and subway trains like King Kong and eat the transit riders up like a bag of Jelly Beans and M&Ms. The ending was very ridiculous. At least Beth and her ex-boyfriend should have survived and live happily ever after. The title was also corny. I thought ""Cloverfield"" was the code word for the movie not the actual title. They should have came up with a better title like ""Escape from New York part 2"", ""Mars Attack 2: their pet left behind"", or ""It Came from the Sewers"".",2,Is this what the Black Smoke Monster really looks like?,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,1902,"['far', 'most', 'over-hyped', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ever', 'wonder', 'made', 'movie', 'mysterious', 'beginning', 'last', 'year', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'spin', 'Lost', 'series', 'SWAN', 'hatch', 'imploded', 'end', 'season', '2', 'possibly', 'releasing', 'part', 'Black', 'Smoke', 'Monster', 'lot', 'other', 'Lost', 'fans', 'thought', 'so', 'also', 'highly', 'doubt', 'just', 're-hashed', 'monster', 'flick', 'where', 'giant', 'creature', 'trashes', 'Manhattan', 'Island', 'Instead', 'perspective', 'Army', 'Marine', 'grunts', 'Air', 'Force', 'pilots', 'scientists', 'perspective', 'bunch', 'young', 'yuppie', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'try', 'survive', 'monster', 'fight', 'bug', 'minions', ""'re"", 'probably', 'like', 'remoras', 'sharks', 'small', 'birds', 'rhinos', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'explanation', 'what', 'monster', 'what', 'little', 'bug', 'looking', 'minions', 'are', 'doing', 'when', 'bite', 'someone', 'monster', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'old', 'Japanese', 'Godzilla', 'new', 'American', 'Godzilla', '1998', 'not', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'Call', 'Cthulhu', 'Voltron', 'Everyone', 'seen', 'type', 'Monster', 'movie', 'before', 'nothing', 'new', 'film', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'end', 'up', 'Svengoolie', 'show', 'Saturday', 'night', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', 'movie', 'weekend', 'later', 'half', 'movie', 'discover', 'was', 'indeed', 'monster', 'was', 'rooting', 'eat', 'people', 'up', 'bite', 'heads', 'tear', 'up', 'L-trains', 'subway', 'trains', 'King', 'Kong', 'eat', 'transit', 'up', 'bag', 'Jelly', 'Beans', 'M', 'Ms', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'ridiculous', 'least', 'Beth', 'ex-boyfriend', 'should', 'have', 'survived', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'title', 'was', 'also', 'corny', 'thought', 'Cloverfield', 'was', 'code', 'word', 'movie', 'not', 'actual', 'title', 'should', 'have', 'came', 'up', 'better', 'title', 'Escape', 'New', 'York', 'part', '2', 'Mars', 'Attack', '2', 'pet', 'left', 'behind', 'Came', 'Sewers']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

We don't know where it came from, what it is, other than it can topple over 50 story buildings & is multiplying quickly with fast moving/growing offspring whose bites bring on a deadly infection to whomever is bitten. It is impervious to non-nuclear military attacks, & is wreaking havoc on to the city.Sounds like your typical Japanese giant monster film, right? Yes, if that was what all this film was about, but it isn't. That's where the handheld POV camera comes in & tells the story of mass hysteria, & the horror of an unknown terror. Of how a group of young New Yorkers try to survive the onslaught of not just the monster, but the military trying to destroy the monster, & a city collapsing around them. It delves into these characters psyches as they confront certain death, time & time again. How they band together for the good of all & the good of one. There is no fairy tale endings here to make the audience feel better. There is no sparing of heart rendering scenes. This is mayhem, wicked, brutal, & heart breaking. This is what it would be like if this scenario was to ever happen. Real people with deep emotions & attachments losing their loved ones & their lives.""Cloverfield"" is a clever heart pulsing thrill ride. It smartly never lets you get to many good glimpses of the monster. Most of the time a shot of the head, the body, the extremities, which make the beast all the more threatening.""Cloverfield"" knows how to get your attention! A particularly great scene is one of the head of the Statue of Liberty flying of it's shoulders & landing blocks into the city, rolling to a stop in the middle of a street. A great parable to 9/11. A great parable of pure unadulterated horror of something so incomprehensible happening, that it overwhelms the logical mind. A true demonstration of just how naked & vulnerable we truly are as a species, whether it be against our own kind, or nature.Yes, ""Cloverfield"" is an allegory to a path that many fear the most & expect the least.

658801,AQ01Q3070LT29,B00005JPXY,James McDonald,"[0, 3]","This film had a gimmick for itself beginning with the magazine poster art we saw last year, in the Entertainment Weekly magazine, of the beheaded Statue of Liberty and New York City being ripped into. J.J. Abrams would be one of the producers and of course we knew him for the LOST tv series and the upcomingStar Trek (Two-Disc Digital Copy Edition)film.By the way, if you see ""Cloverfield"" in a movie theatre right now, you will see a teaser for STAR TREK with the voice of Leonard Nimoy.About ""Cloverfield"", we began to learn that it is a monster film attacking New York City. Some people thought it wasGodzilla: King of the Monstersagain. It is not Godzilla.No pictures were released of the monster, creating the curiosity that you would have to see the movie to satisfy your itch.The Cinemark theatre I went to posted a warning that this film was shot with the hand-held camera technique (a la the college experiment film,The Blair Witch Project) and that the shaky motion of this film might make you sick.I was just fine when I saw the film, but I really did not care for the jittery hand-held camcorder technique.  While it does create the illusion that you are right there with the group of five friends, you never really get a good still look at the monster as the camera keeps moving.This film would have been much better if it were filmed in the normal way.The film begins with a surprise party for one of the guys who will be leaving to go to Japan. This hand-held camera thing really goes on too long at this point to really enjoy the film, but when some of the people go outside for a while, the action begins. It does scare you a little bit.We  follow the 5 young adults (Michael Stahl-David, Jessica Lucas, Lizzy Caplan, T.J. Miller [who holds the camcorder], Mike Vogel) as they run through Manhattan in terror and fright.The film only runs at 84 minutes.Like every film I have seen in 2007 and in January 2008, the conclusion of the film is flat.You might want to seeGodzilla(1998), starring Matthew Brodrick after seeing ""Cloverfield"".

The movie is extremely suspenseful and the way it's filmed made me feel like I was a part of the group, like I knew these people and had a vested interest in their survival.The movie is exciting and I didn't want to miss one second of it.

658805,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00005JPXY,Jason,"[0, 7]","First and foremost, the buzz created by Cloverfield is well deserved.  There will be people who dislike the acting, cliffhangers, or even the filming techniques.  What can't be denied, however, is the epic nature of this movie, and the way in which the viewer is drawn into the chaos.Cloverfield starts off with the beginnings of a surprise party for Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David).  Everyone is getting together in his swanky Manhattan loft to see him on his way to a new career opportunity in Japan.  His friend Lily (Jessica Lucas) and his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) are playing hosts, and it is a joyous event throughout.  Then Rob's love interest Beth (Odette Yustman) shows up with a date.The party continues on, but it's clear that Rob is not himself.  It's evident because the film's humor source, Hud (TJ Miller), is filming every detail of every guest, and happens to catch a fight between Rob and Beth.  Aside from that, Hud keeps gravitating towards Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), a girl in which he's extremely interested.  They have evidently met several times before, but Marlena doesn't remember Hud, and definitely doesn't want anything to do with his company or the camera.And then all hell breaks loose.Manhattan shakes.  The ground rumbles, and the tremors are palpable throughout the city.  Lights go off, screams ring through the air, and it's too close not to remember the events of 9/11.  The residents are frightened out of their minds.  Despite initial reports of an earthquake, in no time at all, we learn that not only are the massive sounds and tremors not earthquakes, but instead they are the ear-splitting footsteps of some gigantic monster attacking the city, destroying everything in its path.The party-goers dash for the street, where they see fireballs, massive chunks of buildings being ripped from hinges, and the Statue of Liberty's head come flying down the street like the view from pins at giant's bowling alley.An epic battle ensues in which the group goes into the heart of the battle, as Rob, Lily, Hud, and Marlena go to find Beth, who left for her apartment after the fight.  They brave the unknown, monsters that are beyond imagination, and darkness through which nothing but fear can be felt.  Drawing perfectly upon fear of the unknown and the loss of sense and perception, the group makes and incredibly dangerous and scary decision to travel through the shutdown, blacked-out subway tunnels.  As they're making their way through the city, they are caught in the middle of heavy fire; the military has brought countless troops, artillery, rocket launchers, and jets to saturate the monster's surroundings with bombs.  It becomes clear in no time that the military is losing the battle.The true genius of this movie is in its concept from beginning to end.  The buzz leads to the anticipation; the usage of a handheld camera for the entire movie's filming style leads to the realistic chaos.  In fact, the shaky, spastic, sometimes confusing camera shots are perhaps the movie's strength and weakness at the same time.  While lending towards credibility, it leaves the audience wanting to see more, changing a point of view for the hopes of a split second's more viewing time.  I wanted to scream a Hud - despite his diligence - to focus a bit more on the action, to ignore the fear for even a split second so I could see the monster and the destruction.  The panic and fear are both understandable and realistic.The ending leads to a desire for more.  The viewer is left wanting, needing to find a more complete resolution.  Perhaps 50 people waited through the entire list of credits for a hope of an extra scene, maybe a hint about the actual ending, even the slightest bit more information.

As a college film project; an experiment, if you will, this would receive a passing grade. But to spend an absolute fortune on special effects and then waste it on deliberately bad cinematography, kind of made me sick. The forced dialog also felt about as realistic as the unlikely visit of the pissed-off space monster and its legion of nasty progeny. Nonetheless, I gave this film 3 stars because I actually liked some of the special effects work; the sound, the lighting, the creatures. They were quite good, actually, and particularly from a helicopter above Manhattan where the frat boys and their girlfriends watched the thing rip apart buildings. And speaking of the cast, the fact that they survived longer than any humans in any zombie movie I've ever seen had me rooting for the creatures. Endless creature attacks, helicopter crashes, bridge collapses, you name it. They just kept going and going and going...Anyway, by the end of the movie, I wanted to kill that idiot with the handicam. I prayed for just 5 minutes of smooth footage, but nooooooooo. And then it was over and I thought to myself what an idiot I was for spending a bunch of money on the DVD rather than downloading it for 4 bucks.

Unlike the others in its subgenre, it makes great use of fantastic and expensive special effects that are so seamlessly integrated into the rest of the film, particularly in the collapse of the Woolworth Building near the onset of the mayhem, that you really feel like you're seeing what it would be like if a giant monster attacked Manhattan. (In this it stands apart not only from its closest thematic equivalents, the dreadful recent remake of GODZILLA and also the three versions of KING KONG.) The dreadful mistake the moviemakers made was to use as its central characters a group of spoiled, self-indulgent twentysomethings in Manhattan, and involve us in their tedious romantic doings to a great extent before the attacks on the city finally begin so we have an unconvincing excuse for why the characters would not try to leave the evacuated island and try to save another character trapped in a collapsed building in midtown. (Worst of all, the camera is held among this Scooby-Doo gang by the Shaggy character, who is supposed to serve as comic relief.) The most fun in the movie are the shots over the characters shoulders of the crossfire between the military and the rampaging monster (at which you never get a good view until the very end, when the filmmakers unwisely spoil the mystery by giving us a long lingering look at it). The film may make some queasy morally at its resonances with 9/11, and others literally with its restless handheld roving shots.",3,Manhattan Monster Mash,1259280000,"11 27, 2009",2009,1638,"['THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'mockumentary', 'horror', 'film', 'consisting', 'footage', 'taken', 'handheld', 'camera', 'others', 'subgenre', 'great', 'use', 'fantastic', 'expensive', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'so', 'seamlessly', 'integrated', 'rest', 'film', 'particularly', 'collapse', 'Woolworth', 'Building', 'onset', 'mayhem', 'really', 'feel', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'giant', 'monster', 'attacked', 'Manhattan', 'apart', 'not', 'only', 'closest', 'thematic', 'equivalents', 'dreadful', 'recent', 'remake', 'GODZILLA', 'also', 'three', 'versions', 'KING', 'KONG', 'dreadful', 'mistake', 'moviemakers', 'made', 'was', 'use', 'central', 'characters', 'group', 'spoiled', 'self-indulgent', 'twentysomethings', 'Manhattan', 'involve', 'tedious', 'romantic', 'doings', 'great', 'extent', 'attacks', 'city', 'finally', 'so', 'have', 'unconvincing', 'excuse', 'why', 'characters', 'would', 'not', 'try', 'leave', 'evacuated', 'island', 'try', 'save', 'character', 'trapped', 'collapsed', 'building', 'midtown', 'Worst', 'camera', 'held', 'Scooby-Doo', 'gang', 'Shaggy', 'character', 'who', 'supposed', 'serve', 'comic', 'relief', 'most', 'fun', 'movie', 'are', 'shots', 'characters', 'shoulders', 'crossfire', 'military', 'rampaging', 'monster', 'never', 'get', 'good', 'view', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'filmmakers', 'unwisely', 'spoil', 'mystery', 'giving', 'long', 'lingering', 'look', 'film', 'may', 'make', 'queasy', 'morally', 'resonances', '9/11', 'others', 'literally', 'restless', 'handheld', 'roving', 'shots']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

Thankfully you did get to see a decent amount of the creature by time the film ended. And you have to love that you weren't watching something that looked like godzilla. Instead of a laughable giant toy you get a really strange looking beast that tears apart anything in its' path.The story follows a guy who will be leaving for Japan and some of his freinds. They throw him a good luck suprise party when you get a little background on the characters up until the lights going out with a loud noise to follow. As they run out into the chaotic city streets they see the Statue of Liberty's come crashing down while catching a quick glimpse of the giant creature in between a couple skyskrapers. As the story continues you follow four of the characters as they do anything they can to survive and save a fellow friend trapped in their destroyed building.Overall I say this one deserves 4 stars. I thought for a low budget film they did a tremendous job making it seem as if NYC was in ruins. All the creature action was exciting, very well done and truley terrifying at times. Just the thought of that situation actually happening will give you some chills. Despite the complaints regarding the camera it really isn't that bad.

Don't believe the 85-minute running time claim on the DVD box, as the rest is just the credits.  Maybe they were paying tribute to the old monster movies that were typically 70-75 minutes long, but I felt a little cheated by that.While there was room for improvement, overall, I liked this movie.  One thing I really liked is that it isn't a remake or a sequel (we've had more than enough of those).  It was definitely different and had the feel of an old-style monster movie, but with modern special effects.I get the whole ""you are there"" handheld camera concept, but it got to be distracting and annoying (it's hard to believe the camcorder shown in the film would've had no image stabilization).  The characters were annoying (especially Hud), and who would be stupid enough to go into a monster-infested city war zone to find his ex-girlfriend?  Then again, those who tag along with said idiot would be considered even more stupid.  And how is it that someone impaled on a rebar can be running around with no problems a few minutes later?The cons aside, the special effects were great, and once the mind-numbing first 15 minutes were over, the movie was quite enjoyable.  I liked the monster, especially its scream, and the parasites were very nice.  For those who complain ""there was nothing about where the monster came from,"" pay attention to the ship in the harbor in the last scene.My fear is that we are now going to get 314 more movies done entirely in first-person handheld camera mode, since if there's anything Hollywood knows how to do, it's copy other successful films to death.Kudos to JJ Abrams for giving us a different kind of movie.

658812,APZC5PRJVM0PY,B00005JPXY,JD,"[0, 4]","Cloverfield is a good, albeit not very good, monster movie.  As far as monster movies go you don't have to try hard to be better than most but that still doesn't make it a great movie.I'm tired of the shaky cam.  In the hands of a good filmmaker, when used in moderation, it can be blended into the flow of the film in such a way that it adds just the needed tension, edge, whatever, into the events on screen.  But when used like this (and Blair Witch, Bourne Supremacy and Bourne Ultimatum, etc. etc.) it is just a cheap gimmick.  I understand what the filmmaker wanted to do, and I think it was an interesting and ambitious idea, but that doesn't mean it will translate into great film.  If you can't watch the film or, worse, you can't make out what is happening in the film, then it is hard to enjoy the movie.In addition, the fact that it was filmed in the ""first person"" angle you don't get the moments you would normally expect in a film where the filmmaker is tying everything together, resolving questions, working out the kinks and correcting inconsistencies, you are just left with the bits and pieces that you have available.  This led to only one type of plausible ending and it was far from satisfying for me.While I'm also griping I'll throw out the type of monsters used in these movies.  How is it that they can be so invincible? Mankind can level cities with ease but we can't seem to hurt a giant bug? And the little monsters the parent spawned were hilarious - though I doubt that was intentional.Still, I gave the movie a middle-of-the-road score because despite not being that good of a movie it is still fun to watch the first time through and there really aren't that many great monster flicks to choose from.

The film kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. My stomach was so tight that I had lost any interest in eating after the film. Or maybe that was the extreme ""video-verite"" shaky camera handling.""Cloverfield"" follows a group of successful 20-something New Yorkers, whose celebration of the imminent departure of one of their number is interrupted by the arrival of a horrific, building-bashing monster. The conceit of the film is that is was recorded by a group of five people who split off from the party. Following some Gen-Y (""Y"" for YouTube) impulse to record everything, they drag their camera along through military counterattack, destroyed buildings and over-the-top mayhem. The medium gives the film a gritty man-in-the-street feel, and also gives the filmmakers a perfect rationale for not telling us where the monster comes from and what it wants -- we know only as much as the film's participants can see.But the film also has other strands and layers, which take it a notch above other monster films. The film is imagined in layers - we are movie viewers in a theater, watching a film located and studied by the military, which was shot by a group of New Yorkers, which itself was recorded over another (and important) piece of tape. The filmmakers carefully attended to the complicated layers of human relationships, which in a few visual strokes early on, built up a surprising amount of emotional complexity. Smart, serious, hunky Rob is crazy for gentle, gorgeous Beth, but is distraught that she attends the party with a new beau. Goofy, loyal Hud is nutty about snide/reclusive Marlene, who gives him as much attention as she would a 6-foot tall cockroach. Rob's bro Jason is madly in love with Lily. Each is played by a newcomer, so there's no star power to distract from the thesis that Bad Things Will Happen To Ordinary Well-off Young People. The whole going-away party episode may seem stuck on to some, but it is integral to the relationships that develop between the characters throughout the film.The film's effects were eye popping and very in-your-face: buildings collapse, bridges are wrecked and cars are stomped aplenty. The army has its hands full, and more. The monster, especially in the film's first half, is seen only in snippets. As with any monster movie, the less seen of the beast the better, and when we do get a fuller view, it's a bit of a letdown. But through all the carnage and devastation (Manhattan gets TRASHED!) the characters' initial (and realistic) shock and confusion gives way to a simple, logical yet foolhardy rescue attempt.Maybe because of their anonymity, the actors were able to meld into a realistic group, rather than fighting for star standing. And thanks to the excellent writing and directing, the characters were recognizable types. Though I hardly knew the characters, I nearly wept when one lost his life. And I laughed as Hud, Rob's boisterous and randy best friend, spent time running at the mouth or (between horrifying escapes from the monster) hitting on hard-to-get Marlene. These touches gave the viewer a delicious sense of the complexities brewing even in the most terrified of brains.The 9/11 links were understated, but omnipresent. So much so that some viewers might wonder if ""Cloverfield"" was a subtle allegory of that attack and the military response to it. Nevertheless, the parallels were sometimes unnerving -- an unexpected danger shocks an unprepared city; paper floats from damaged buildings; a skyscraper collapses and sends dust clouds into the street; evacuees clog bridges; the city canyon's walls echo the wailing sirens of emergency vehicles. If they meant nothing by the parallel, the filmmakers at least mined the store of commonly-held images of that day.""Cloverfield"" had a few plot holes and implausibilities--horrific injuries do little to slow down important characters?. But the film maintained its consistency throughout, and never found really stupid reasons to keep the camera rolling. For a great film about the way a group of unprepared, ordinary people react to a vicious and implacable threat, ""Cloverfield"" has few equals. A great time and a smartly-done film.",5,Godzilla marries the Blair Witch on 9/11,1200873600,"01 21, 2008",2008,4288,"['spite', 'anxiety', 'months-long', 'hyping', 'found', 'Cloverfield', 'met', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'film', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'stomach', 'was', 'so', 'tight', 'had', 'lost', 'interest', 'eating', 'film', 'maybe', 'was', 'extreme', 'video-verite', 'shaky', 'camera', 'handling', 'Cloverfield', 'group', 'successful', '20-something', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'celebration', 'imminent', 'departure', 'one', 'number', 'interrupted', 'arrival', 'horrific', 'building-bashing', 'monster', 'conceit', 'film', 'was', 'recorded', 'group', 'five', 'people', 'who', 'split', 'off', 'party', 'Following', 'Gen-Y', 'Y', 'YouTube', 'record', 'everything', 'drag', 'camera', 'military', 'counterattack', 'destroyed', 'buildings', 'over-the-top', 'mayhem', 'medium', 'film', 'gritty', 'man-in-the-street', 'feel', 'also', 'filmmakers', 'perfect', 'rationale', 'not', 'telling', 'where', 'monster', 'what', 'know', 'only', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'participants', 'can', 'see.But', 'film', 'also', 'other', 'strands', 'layers', 'take', 'notch', 'other', 'monster', 'films', 'film', 'imagined', 'layers', 'are', 'movie', 'viewers', 'theater', 'watching', 'film', 'located', 'studied', 'military', 'was', 'shot', 'group', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'was', 'recorded', 'important', 'piece', 'tape', 'filmmakers', 'carefully', 'attended', 'complicated', 'layers', 'human', 'relationships', 'few', 'visual', 'strokes', 'early', 'built', 'up', 'surprising', 'amount', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'Smart', 'serious', 'hunky', 'Rob', 'crazy', 'gentle', 'gorgeous', 'Beth', 'distraught', 'party', 'new', 'beau', 'Goofy', 'loyal', 'Hud', 'nutty', 'snide/reclusive', 'Marlene', 'who', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'would', '6-foot', 'tall', 'cockroach', 'Rob', 'bro', 'Jason', 'madly', 'love', 'Lily', 'played', 'newcomer', 'star', 'power', 'distract', 'thesis', 'Bad', 'Things', 'Will', 'Happen', 'Ordinary', 'Well-off', 'Young', 'People', 'whole', 'going-away', 'party', 'episode', 'may', 'seem', 'stuck', 'integral', 'relationships', 'develop', 'characters', 'film.The', 'film', 'effects', 'were', 'eye', 'popping', 'very', 'in-your-face', 'buildings', 'collapse', 'bridges', 'are', 'wrecked', 'cars', 'are', 'stomped', 'aplenty', 'army', 'hands', 'full', 'more', 'monster', 'especially', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'seen', 'only', 'snippets', 'monster', 'movie', 'less', 'seen', 'beast', 'better', 'when', 'do', 'get', 'fuller', 'view', 'bit', 'letdown', 'carnage', 'devastation', 'Manhattan', 'TRASHED', 'characters', 'initial', 'realistic', 'shock', 'confusion', 'way', 'simple', 'logical', 'yet', 'foolhardy', 'rescue', 'attempt.Maybe', 'anonymity', 'actors', 'were', 'able', 'meld', 'realistic', 'group', 'rather', 'fighting', 'star', 'standing', 'thanks', 'excellent', 'writing', 'directing', 'characters', 'were', 'recognizable', 'types', 'hardly', 'knew', 'characters', 'nearly', 'wept', 'when', 'one', 'lost', 'life', 'laughed', 'Hud', 'Rob', 'boisterous', 'randy', 'best', 'friend', 'spent', 'time', 'running', 'mouth', 'horrifying', 'escapes', 'monster', 'hitting', 'hard-to-get', 'Marlene', 'touches', 'gave', 'viewer', 'delicious', 'sense', 'complexities', 'brewing', 'even', 'most', 'terrified', 'brains.The', '9/11', 'links', 'were', 'understated', 'omnipresent', 'So', 'much', 'viewers', 'might', 'wonder', 'Cloverfield', 'was', 'subtle', 'allegory', 'attack', 'military', 'response', 'Nevertheless', 'parallels', 'were', 'sometimes', 'unnerving', 'unexpected', 'danger', 'shocks', 'unprepared', 'city', 'paper', 'floats', 'damaged', 'buildings', 'skyscraper', 'dust', 'clouds', 'street', 'evacuees', 'clog', 'bridges', 'city', 'canyon', 'walls', 'echo', 'wailing', 'sirens', 'emergency', 'vehicles', 'meant', 'nothing', 'parallel', 'filmmakers', 'least', 'mined', 'store', 'commonly-held', 'images', 'day', 'Cloverfield', 'had', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'implausibilities', 'horrific', 'injuries', 'do', 'little', 'slow', 'down', 'important', 'characters', 'film', 'maintained', 'consistency', 'never', 'found', 'really', 'stupid', 'reasons', 'keep', 'camera', 'rolling', 'great', 'film', 'way', 'group', 'unprepared', 'ordinary', 'people', 'react', 'vicious', 'implacable', 'threat', 'Cloverfield', 'few', 'equals', 'great', 'time', 'smartly-done', 'film']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

As at least one other view stated, the ""HudCam"" is so distracting and so central to the plot that its difficult to become engorssed into the movie.  Without the ""HudCam"" this movie would have been much more inviting and would allow you to be drawn in and entralled as the monster effects are better than most movies and the story is actually believable.  Unfortunately, you spend so much time turning your head side to side to be able to see the correct angle to enjoy the film and even though Hud states that he is filming the event for ""the record,"" you still have to wonder why he holds onto the camera 1) while his friends are nearly dying 2) While they are trying to beat off rampant insetoid attackers and 3) during the last second of his death.

658817,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,B00005JPXY,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[1, 3]","Instead of using traditional movie camera film, the producers of ""Cloverfield"" decided to rely instead on film from a hand-held camcorder to shoot the scenes of the movie.  The result is a fairly scary film, but the camcorder filming is very difficult to watch.As for the movie itself, Rob (Michael Stahl-David) has just received a cushy new job in Japan.  Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas) have decided to throw Rob a surprise going away party.  As the guests begin to arrive, Jason asks his friend Hud (T.J. Miller) to videotape some goodbye messages for Rob.  Among the guests is Rob's ex-girlfriend Beth (Odette Yustman), who has shown up with her new boyfriend.  Also there is Marlena (Lizzy Caplan).  Rob and Beth get into a heated argument, and she and her boyfriend leave the party.Just as the party's beginning to get going, a loud noise occurs outside and all of the lights in Manhattan suddenly go dark.  Something very large has begun an all-out assault on the city.  The startled guests run outside to see a large creature destroying buildings, vehicles and other people. Instead of running away from the creature, Rob, Jason, Lily, Marlena and Hud decide to try to rescue Beth, who's apartment is in mid-town and just happens to be directly in the path of the creature.  Hud has also kept the camcorder running.  What results is a frantic trek across mid-town Manhattan in a desparate search to save Beth before the creature gets there first.  Will Rob and his friends survive, or will the creature get them?I thought this movie was scary in some parts, but I had a difficult time watching due to the constant jumping of the film.  I thought that the camcorder idea was interesting, but it did make viewing the movie much more difficult than if it would have been filmed in a normal manner.  Also, I was disappointed that I never got a real clear look at the creature.  I thought that the special effects were pretty good, especially the head of the Statue of Liberty rolling down the street.Overall, I did enjoy this movie, but I think it could have been better.",4,"Scary, But The Footage Is Hard to Watch",1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,2116,"['Instead', 'using', 'traditional', 'movie', 'camera', 'film', 'producers', 'Cloverfield', 'decided', 'rely', 'instead', 'film', 'hand-held', 'camcorder', 'shoot', 'scenes', 'movie', 'result', 'fairly', 'scary', 'film', 'camcorder', 'filming', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch.As', 'movie', 'Rob', 'Michael', 'Stahl-David', 'just', 'received', 'cushy', 'new', 'job', 'Japan', 'Rob', 'brother', 'Jason', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'girlfriend', 'Lily', 'Jessica', 'Lucas', 'have', 'decided', 'throw', 'Rob', 'surprise', 'going', 'away', 'party', 'guests', 'begin', 'arrive', 'Jason', 'friend', 'Hud', 'T.J.', 'Miller', 'videotape', 'goodbye', 'messages', 'Rob', 'guests', 'Rob', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Beth', 'Odette', 'Yustman', 'who', 'shown', 'up', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Also', 'Marlena', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'Rob', 'Beth', 'get', 'heated', 'argument', 'boyfriend', 'leave', 'party.Just', 'party', 'beginning', 'get', 'going', 'loud', 'noise', 'outside', 'lights', 'Manhattan', 'suddenly', 'go', 'dark', 'Something', 'very', 'large', 'begun', 'all-out', 'assault', 'city', 'startled', 'guests', 'run', 'outside', 'see', 'large', 'creature', 'destroying', 'buildings', 'vehicles', 'other', 'people', 'Instead', 'running', 'away', 'creature', 'Rob', 'Jason', 'Lily', 'Marlena', 'Hud', 'decide', 'try', 'rescue', 'Beth', 'who', 'apartment', 'mid-town', 'just', 'happens', 'be', 'directly', 'path', 'creature', 'Hud', 'also', 'kept', 'camcorder', 'running', 'What', 'results', 'frantic', 'trek', 'mid-town', 'Manhattan', 'desparate', 'search', 'save', 'Beth', 'creature', 'there', 'first', 'Will', 'Rob', 'friends', 'survive', 'will', 'creature', 'get', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'scary', 'parts', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'watching', 'due', 'constant', 'jumping', 'film', 'thought', 'camcorder', 'idea', 'was', 'interesting', 'did', 'make', 'viewing', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'normal', 'manner', 'Also', 'was', 'disappointed', 'never', 'got', 'real', 'clear', 'look', 'creature', 'thought', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'especially', 'head', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'rolling', 'down', 'street.Overall', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

Shimkus ""Movie Manji""","[1, 5]","I watched the commentary right after, because it left me searching for more answers (any answers) than what it intended to leave with. Matt Reeves, the director, said that the monster was inspired by J.J. Abrams visit to Japan. There, he saw his future Cloverfield all over the place: GODZILLA. Well, he recently made this company called Bad Robot, and the idea of having the American equivalent was what he definately wanted as the first film for Bad Robot productions. He selected Matt Reeves even though Reeves had other plans and together created 'Our' American Godzilla. Both Director Matt Reeves and Producer J.J. Abrams have a background in television. J.J. Abrams produced the hit T.V. series Lost and all the rage on television is in crying, fussing, gritty, reality shows. Shows that thrust a motley bunch of young/old people, unsuspectingly, into bad situations. That's the other side to Cloverfields story. Real people, seemingly taken straight out of their Reality show without consenting any of them. Reeves has this essential quality of real people, in real situations, only Abrams has helped beef up the entertainment with sensational suspense and bigger-than-life situations that made M.I. 3 an international blockbuster. Even if it was handled with a basic budget that got the job done but didn't leave much room for lollygagging that would have made it a longer film. At the end of the commentary I still didn't have the answers that I wanted, like why the heck is it called Cloverfield and loads more. Maybe it's the secret military code name for the project that created the thing?",4,N. America's movie monster is a big monkey.

658819,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,B00005JPXY,"J. Elmquist ""Moviephile""","[1, 2]","In an effort to make `An American Monster Movie' in the vein of Godzilla, JJ Abrams (Alias, Mission Impossible 3) launched his idea of a mysterious creature coming out of New York Harbor and trashing the city with an intriguing teaser trailer.  A group of young Manhattan yuppies are in the middle of a going away party for their friend who is leaving, suddenly there is what feels like an earthquake, then an explosion up in the distance that collapses a skyscraper.  Then the head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the middle of the street and slides to a halt, showing a lot of damage and leaving us wondering...'What the HELL?""  There ends the teaser trailer.There are few things more terrifying then seeing a catastrophic event unfold in the eyes of a person who is actually seeing it happen and recording it at the same time.  Lets put aside the questionably realistic aspects such as how this one person came across so many events of the attack that we get to see so much.  And that these young people would venture back into the city to rescue their friend who they believe is trapped.  Focusing on those things just raises skepticism.  Let's remember, this is a MOVIE...about a MONSTER; basic suspension of disbelief is required when you first walk in on this one.So, moving on.  The concept of the movie being shot with a hand held camera is not new, everyone remembers `The Blair Witch' project.  Some remember it and get nauseated at the thought of it.  This one is not nearly as bad, however it is like watching the entire story through a drinking straw.  You only gets specific pieces of information at one time.  The film makers use this to their advantage whenever possible.  It actually cuts on production costs and allows things like off camera sounds to have a greater affect.Now for the plot;  The video starts at the beginning as if being viewed by an official group, probably Military or high Government.  It is deemed `Classified' and titled `Cloverfield'.  The drama starts with two young people who have had an intimate night together.  Then the video kicks over to the preparation for the aforementioned party.  The party is for Rob, who is leaving for Japan.  Rob is in love with Beth (the couple at the beginning of the video), and vice versa. Apparently they have been for a long time.  But only recently did they consummate their feelings and then document their day afterward at Coney Island on the same video camera.  Once the party is in full swing, the festivities are abruptly interrupted by explosions and earthquakes.  As Hud, one of the party goers, documents the attack, there are moments where he stops recording and you see glimpses of Rob and Beth's `Good Day'.  This is a reminder of why Rob goes back into the city for her.  He regrets not following up on his feelings for Beth after their night together, especially after she shows up at the party with a date.  He feels compelled to go rescue her if possible because he won't just wait to find out what happens to her later.  This is the stuff of young compulsive love, and over the top drama; `do anything for it, damn the consequences'.  But it is a somewhat valid reason as to why the four turn to go back into the city to give us better glimpses of this creature who is tearing up the city.The movie has some genuinely terrifying scenes and the special effects are top notch.  You get a good sense of this being real and you don't ever really find yourself telling the guy to point the camera in a specific direction.  They seem to get everything you need to see.  The monster itself is a strange sight to behold.  There is never any explanation for it's appearance or it's purposes.  Many theories are thrown out but nothing is really confirmed.  The ending is very ambiguous and really leaves things out in the open.  I have to say I liked this movie but mostly for it's single perspective use of the camera and how well it's told through this method.

658820,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JPXY,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[114, 136]","Now that all the hype has die down I was able to give this film an objective look. I have to admit I was impressed. This movie throws out the music, set-ups, and cheap scares out the window - in a good way. Nothing in this movie tells you you're watching a movie of course. You're completely disorientated from start to finish, completely uncomfortable and on edge. And that is a hell of an achievement in today's de-sensitized movie environment. While I didn't jump once, I did find myself clutching the chair arms at various points.I see why viewers would fine this derivative but every monster movie clich&eacute; is in there, and so it should be. The monster destroys landmarks. The military fight the monster. News reports advancing the plot. But it's delivered with such style and such punch that you can't help but be awed. You're seeing these events on an ant's eye level. There are no sweeping special effects shots of the White House being demolished by aliens, no aerial shots of buildings being destroyed - instead we get distant, unidentifiable bangs, fires obscured by the cityscape, an enormous leg moving behind a skyscraper - and a distant object which comes hurtling through the air, finally landing amidst chaos in a street, revealing itself to be the head of the statue of liberty.This personal touch goes deeper - characters disappear from the story, and we (the audience) don't know their fate because the main characters don't. To be honest, I don't know whether I love this or like it but I was impressed. The subway scene was probably the best bit for me, and the ending slightly disappointed. I really wish they had elaborated more on the bites but I suppose that wouldn't really have been in-keeping with the point of the movie, same theory as 'Alien'- it's scarier when you DON'T see the monster. Not that I'm saying this movie is scary in any way. As a horror fan, it takes a lot to scare me also.The effects, with one or two exceptions (the money shot of the monster at the end springs to mind), are seamlessly integrated. A lifelong ""effects spotter"", I found myself not even noticing when something that MUST have been CGI was on screen. Beside that it's a good film and I have to give thanks to those who had given me the extra push to finally watch this.

658822,A11423AYVMMC4K,B00005JPXY,"Jeremy G. Snyder ""Darkstalker""","[1, 6]","First of all, all of those people complaining about how this movie didn't reveal any answers about the creature, you obviously didn't get the point.  This isn't a standard monster movie.  It's a pseudo-documentary of the chaos.  And not told from the perspective of the military, Department of Defense, emergency personnel, the president, etc.  but from the point of few of just a bunch of regular twenty-something year-olds having a going-away party for the main character, Rob, only to have it become the worst day of their lives.  To use a good analogy, a lot of people have compared the destruction of NYC in this movie to 9/11.  In all of the camera footage that was being filmed by regular people such as tourists right as 9/11 was happening, was there any mention of Osama Bin Laden, Al Queda, trade embargoes and bombings of Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, etc.  No, there wasn't.  It was just chaos and terror all around.  The same thing is happening here.Also don't believe all of those reviews who say that there's nothing likable about the cast.  From the very beginning it's obvious that Rob cares about and even loves Beth.  WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD!  The film even begins with a previously recorded segment of about a month ago where Rob wakes up and eventually wakes Beth up, whom he just slept with.  It's revealed that they're heading out to Coney Island that day as she has never been there before.  Cut to a month later with a new recording been done over the other one.  This one is Rob's brother, Jason, and his girlfriend, Lily, setting up a surprise going-away party for Rob as he's leaving for Japan.  The assign Rob's dunderheaded, yet lovable friend, Hud, with the task of gaining testimonials from people wishing Rob good luck.  Which Hud accepts once he learns that Lily's friend, Marlena, is going to be at the party.  Marlena is a bit of a loner, but it's obvious that Hud likes her, even though she doesn't remember him from the few times that they've met.  It's funny the way that he badly tries to hit on her and get her to say something for the camera. Eventually Beth shows up with her own date in tow, which leaves Rob distraught.  Jason and Hud get Lily to reveal that Rob and Beth, who had been friends since high school, slept together a few weeks ago.  However Rob didn't call Beth again after their day at Coney Island.  Rob says something insulting to Beth's date and he and Beth then get into a fight with her storming back to her own apartment.  Hud and Jason then try to cheer Rob up when suddenly a huge tremor occurs.WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!! All the electricity goes out for a few seconds and then when it comes back on, everyone sees the news about an oil tanker having been destroyed.  They go up to the roof and then see an explosion.  They then all go down to street level where they see the head of the Statue of Liberty tossed into their street along with an eventual glimpse of some skyscraper-sized monster.  And then all hell breaks loose.  At first all of them try going across the Brooklyn Bridge with throngs of masses only to have the tail of the mysterious monster destroy the bridge, taking Jason's life.  When the others get together to cope with the horror of Jason's death, Rob says that he needs to go see Beth since she called him saying that she was trapped in her building.  It's obvious therefore that he loves her, which makes the ending all the more tragic.  You care for the friends who follow him out of loyalty even when he tells them that they can follow the Army out of Manhattan.  You really come to care for Rob and Beth since they both love each other.  You also feel sorry for Hud, whom himself is cares for Marlena and tries to cheer her up with jokes after she saves his life, ultimately at the expense of her own, as some bites that she sustains end up doing her in (which is then disturbing to Hud).  Hud was an extra treat for me, as he provided some of the light comic relief that was almost a mirror of one of my friends whom I saw the movie with.  Me and the others were teasing him about it all throughout the film.As for the monster.  What can you say about the monster?  It definitely wasn't Godzilla (as rumors leading up to the film's release said it was).  Throughout most of the movie you only see short glimpses of its appendages and tail.  It's also revealed that parts of its body fall off and turn into big spider-like creatures which then attack people (they're the ones that do Marlena in).  A few times we see the creatures face and jaws open wide, but only briefly.  It isn't until five minutes to the end when we get what in my opinion is the money shot of the whole ordeal.  Early morning in Central Park after a helicopter crash, Hud finds himself underneath the behemoth looking up, to which the creature looks down at him and you see a perfectly clear view of the monster's ugly mug with Hud shuddering in horror just before it does him in. END ALL SPOILERS!Ultimately the movie is a great mix of terror, tragedy, and light humor at a few times, and even some romance (but not heavy-handed and cheesy, but rather brief, subtle, and genuine).  It wasn't Godzilla, but it blew away that ridiculous Godzilla movie of a decade ago.  You would feel any empathy for this monster, but will instead feel that it's something that came straight from hell.  The only legitimate reasons that I could think of for not seeing or liking this movie is if you have a bit of a queasy stomach for overly shaky cameras and footage that brings up the memory of 9/11.  Otherwise, YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!P.S.  For those you that might want some answers, near the end when the video show the lovely couple of Rob and Beth at Coney Island a month ago, off in the horizon you can see something falling from the sky into the ocean.  Most likely it's the monster itself.",5,"Terror, tragedy, and the human response",1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,5875,"['First', 'people', 'complaining', 'how', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'reveal',

658826,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00005JPXY,J from NY,"[6, 10]","""Cloverfield"" is an entertaining addition to the ""creature is attacking the city"" sci-fi/horror genre, but it is difficult to take it very seriously at all.The concept is promisingly ominous: a group of ordinary people (they aren't though: each and every one of them is a Gap ad, an ""I'm Too Hip To Be At This Party"" stereotype) who happened to be recording a friend's departure to Japan (hint hint) on camcorder when, without warning, a terrible catastrophe strikes: a creature of some sort begins demolishing New York City.The chief problem with this is that we cannot believe in any of the characters, not for one second: they are the mediated archetypes of youth.  Hud (T.J. Miller) is the most sympathetic character: he has no pretensions and simply runs through the film trying to keep the ""hero"" (Michael Stahl-David) Rob Hawkins from making the most irresponsible decisions possible, which he does anyway.  The creepiest and most effective part of the film, in my opinion, is when the silent but mysterious type, Marlena, is bitten by one of the nasty critters spawned by the hulking hydra which thrashes at the center of civilization: she walks onto camera and says simply: ""I don't feel good..."".  Then, something beyond comprehension occurs.The ending is both saccharine, corny, and very effective on the monster side of things: poor Hud makes an unwise decision, after miraculously surviving a full force plane crash with Rob and his irritating Juliet (the whole love story disrupts the mood of Lovecraftian dread, and is the chief flaw of the film) to look straight in the face of the monster: wow, is it ugly.Films like this--missed opportunities for greatness--awaken the desire in me for some imaginary film board that restricts great new concepts to great filmmakers.

It's basically the Blair Witch Project with a monster and...a bigger budget but it's only flaw is that it follows the Blair Witch Project type of film-making too closely. By the end a movie that could of been entirely fantastic is just literly...The Blair Witch Project with a monster. Yes you never saw the witch and you see the monster here but still the formula is about the same.The actors and effects carry the film well so they might as well of went the distance and gave us an ending with more answers and one less gloomy.

658830,A3GUTAC5UVKUH,B00005JPXY,Joe Carugati,"[2, 7]","After witnessing (and pondering and questioning over) an insane teaser trailer before summer's ""Transformers,"" and then going on film boards and searching for any information, I've been slightly hooked on ""Cloverfield"". I'm a fan of J.J. Abrams' work (mostly ""Lost""), love creature-features, and most of all, mystery surrounding films. Never before have I seen such a better marketing job than ""Cloverfield"". Everyone was left in the open, making up their own ideas for what exactly was destroying New York City, where it came from, and most importantly, what it looked like. In other words, the hype was huge for this film and going into it, I knew that it just couldn't meet my expectations. Well, it did just that and possibly exceeded them.The film opens in New York City, where a goodbye-party is being held for Rob (Michael-Stahl David), whose leaving the country for a job in Japan. At the party, his best friend, Hud (T.J. Miller) is given the task of filming the entire get-together. Throughout his ""documenting"", we observe Rob's brother, Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend, Lily (Jessica Ford) flirting and being cute with each other, Hud's crush on a girl named Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), and finally, Rob's dilemma with his best friend, Beth (Odette Yustman), who he recently just slept with and has feelings for (which he hasn't told her about, of course). Anyway, Beth and Rob get into an argument and she leaves the party in a hurry. As Rob is talking about his relationship with her, the party is interrupted by what seems like an earthquake. The party-goers rush to the streets only to see the decapitated head of the Statue of Liberty land in the streets. From this point on, we know that whatever caused the earthquake is no earthquake and whatever it is, it's big and not of this world. The army comes in to evacuate, but Beth leaves a message on Rob's phone, telling her that she's in trouble and needs help. With Hud, Marlena, Lily, and his brother in tow, Rob decides to head towards her apartment, away from safety and right into the path of the monster's destruction.The plot is fairly simple and not entirely original. A monster attacks New York City, while people try to outrun and live throughout the destruction around them. The core of the film though is not exactly the monster, but more the love story between Rob and Beth. It's not shown in a melodramatic, sappy way and there's not much dialog between the two characters, but it keeps the film together (I mean, if there wasn't a connection between the two, Rob wouldn't go into the city and there would be no movie). Rob is a person that many guys can relate to (wants to tell his feelings to the girl he's always liked) and that makes him even more believable and the audience can understand his actions because of this. Since their relationship is strong, the film becomes even more intense as you want to see both of them and Rob's friends make it through the ordeal.Speaking of Rob and his friends, they are played by mostly unknown actors, which also helps the film. Not one actor is really well known save for Mike Vogel (""Poseidon"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake) and that really helped me identify more with who they were as characters in the film instead of who was playing them. Michael Stahl-David does a great job as Rob and you feel for him as his friends begin to die even while he's still determined to save Beth. The best actor in the film though is definitely T.J. Miller. He brings a much needed amount of comic relief as the film's camera-man, but also layers of drama that I didn't expect to see from him (one scene of his, in particular, was quite heartbreaking). The rest of the cast do a fine job and were all believable, great in their roles, and you didn't want them to die.Another issue to bring up about the movie is how it's filmed. It's all done with a video camera that someone's dad would use to film his son's baseball game. At first, this can be nauseating (the party scene), but you get used to it and it really attributes to the greatness of the film. By shooting it in this style, everything feels real (even if it is CGI), because it's shown in a perspective that everyday people have experienced. Also, since the film is from one view, the audience is on the ride with these people and you follow them through the streets, tunnels, buildings, and more, as the creature attacks them and others. Two scenes, in particular, are intense, mainly because of the use of the camera. One takes place in a subway tunnel with something else besides the main creature (I'll get to this later) and the other, in the streets, as the group tries to run to safety, the creature closes in on them, crushing everything in its path. As much as I was apprehensive about the filming style, I'm happy to say that it makes the film even better than it is and gives it a mood that no other creature feature will be able to imitate.Finally, the main reason most people will see this movie is for the monster and let me say, it does not disappoint. I'm not going to give away much about what it looks like, but all I'm going to say is that it's huge, walks like a bat would, eats people, and little creatures climb off its body. These little creatures are the ones that make their presence known in the subway scene (mentioned above). These things are fast, vicious, and their bite leaves a not-so-pretty consequence. The monster definitely lived up to the hype for me and its little minions just added to the greatness about it.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The acting was top-notch, the filming style was unique and original, the special effects were amazing, the story was simple, but effective, and finally, the monster was amazingly done. As much as I loved the movie, I have a feeling that I'll never get the impact I did when I first watched it. I may be wrong though. After all, I didn't think the movie would live up to my expectations and I was wrong about that. It's not a classic by any means, but it gives you exactly what you came to the theaters for - a scary, intense, thrilling ride. And a darn good one at that.",5,Cloverfield,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,6142,"['witnessing', 'pondering', 'questioning', 'over', 'insane', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'summer', 'Transformers', 'then',

All too frequently with movies of this genre you reach the end feeling bored, disappointed, and even cheated, but Cloverfield went beyond my highest expectations.  I'd recommend it without hesitation to anyone who's a fan of movies like this.Two points about the negative reviews, which frankly astonished me when I first saw them, given how good the movie was.  First, it's true that it's filmed through a handheld video camera and is very shaky, but I got used to that quickly and practically forgot about it as the story hit its stride.  Second, I came to the film knowing absolutely nothing about it except that it might be vaguely X-Files'esque, and I think that made a tremendous difference.  If you know what it's about you may have certain expectations about how it *should* unfold, based on other similarly-themed films you've seen; since I had no idea at all and no preconceptions, I was able to just experience it on its own terms.

When someone says a movie is 'sickening', they usually mean either that the movie contained material which caused them to feel revulsion or they are using the word as hyperbole for 'very bad'. I am not using it in either of those senses. When I say this movie was 'sickening' I am using the term literally.I suffer from motion sickness and have done so ever since I was a child. The effect of the hand-held camera was to cause continuous swaying and jerking of the images on the screen. Whether or not this was an effective way of communicating the message of the film I couldn't tell you. All I can say is that in me it induced severe nausea, such that I had to lie down in a dark room for a couple of hours until the feeling wore off.My one-star rating is obviously completely subjective, since those who don't share my problem will be able to give reviews based on the entertainment value of the movie and I'm not doing that.

During that night as they are having a great time especially using a DV camera to film the going away party their fun is suddenly is interuppted by a horrifying incident going on in the city as they flee out as they film what is going on. A hideous giantic monster of unknown origin attacks the big apple as now our five friends must flee the city, try to stay alive and find out what the military is up to all recorded on a camera.Stylish and original Sci-fi horror thriller from J.J. Abrahams (""Transformers 2007"" and ""Lost"") is one of the most unique and stunning films in recent memory. It uses a mockumentary-esque feel to it and makes you feel like your part of the movie too with it's DV camera filmmaking and good performances by the cast. This movie plays as a semi-realistic homage to the monster movies of yore and Japan of course, the film is kind of gory at times for a PG-13 rated movie and it's a heart-pounding and suspenseful shocker that never lets go. The monster designs are quite cool even with the little parasitic creatures, this movie launched a major hype campaign before it was released thanks to a clever teaser and movie poster.

658840,A3F9VH8916IA40,B00005JPXY,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[2, 5]","When reviewing Cloverfield obvious comparisons to movies likeGodzillaare easy to make, but this film is so much more then a simple monster bash. Cloverfield is a wild mix of Godzilla like monster fun, blended withThe Blair Witch Projectcamera style andJaws (30th Anniversary Edition)like suspense all blended together to make one of the most perfect monster/disaster/horror films of the modern day.First off lets give some credit to the incredible job the producers did marketing this film. For all the months leading up to its release potential viewer's searched the internet for clews as to what this film may be about, all to no avail. No movie I've ever seen has been surrounded by so much mystery. What is it really about? Is it a giant monster? Aliens? Government tests? What? You really have to see it (or read reviews on Amazon) to find out.The movie is shot completely, from beginning to end, on a hand held digital camera that different characters take turns filming with throughout the course of the movie, very much like Blair Witch Project. Although this can take some getting used to, and yes it did make me extremely dizzy and disoriented, the artistic benefits from filming a movie in this way are obvious from the beginning. Viewers are able to see enough of the action and disaster to satisfy the biggest action junky, yet enough is left unexplained that the movie doesn't at any time seem fake or scripted. You are able to see the entire story as it unfolds though the eyes of a very small group of people which allows you to identify and ultimately sympathize with them. As well as giving the movie a more personal effect, the home camera gives this movie a very post 9/11 feel. We've all seen the shots of the WTC falling in NYC and people running for their lives as the dust from the towers quickly moves down the street engulfing everything in its path. Watching the Empire State Building fall to pieces before your very eyes will bring back memories of those fateful days in 2001 when our lives changed forever. The camera style also gives this movie a very Jaws like effect. The director of this film was able to show just enough of the monster to satisfy his audience, yet also hide it enough so that by the end you still aren't quite sure what it was or what it looked like. Although there are some shots where the monster thing is in full view and staring right at the camera, it is still hard to see because the camera is of such ""poor"" quality and doesn't allow you to see much. The monster is hidden in full view, a brilliant way of building suspense that is as scary as it is original (at least in the giant monster genera).Despite the very blatant references to 9/11 it is very refreshing to see a film that is brave enough to re-create that fateful day yet stay neutral on any political commentary. Cloverfield does not exist to pass judgment on anyone, or to give its own opinions or views on 9/11, instead it tries, and succeeds in my opinion, in showing how the events took place from the eyes of those who witness it. The movie focuses on the disaster itself, separating itself from all the political commentary and conspiracy theories that followed, and for that I give it major props for that.Although the movie steers clear of a lot of political commentary, it does not hesitate to give us a generous helping of social commentary. What does everyone do when the see the head of the Statue of Liberty rolling down the street? They take pictures on their camera phones of course, and then they huddle around the video camera to get a glimpse of what it was that just invaded their city. What do people do when the cops and military are preoccupied with fighting off the giant monster? They loot electronic stores and steal TV's and radios, a clear reference to the chaos that followed disaster in New Orleans and to a lesser extent Baghdad after the US invasion. People watch spongbob squarpants along with news footage of the destruction of Manhattan. Its the little things like this that are what sets Cloverfield above Godzilla andKing Kong (Widescreen Edition)(as much as I love Peter Jackson) and makes it something memorable and special.But this movie doesn't get bogged down in its social commentary and 9/11 references. in its heart of hearts Cloverfield, for all its artistic filming style and commentary, really just wants to be an action/horror movie. From the second the monster shows up in the city to the very end every minute is filled with gun battles, fighter jets flying overhead unleashing their rockets into the city, and old fashioned giant monster destroying the city fun. This is what Godzilla should have been, instead of being a Hollywood style movie, shot in a very unoriginal and cheesy style with an unimaginative script and plot, Cloverfield manages to give action on a monumental scale yet show its audience relatively little of what is actually going on. The scares in this movie resemble those found in movies like28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition). There is a scene about halfway though the movie that takes place in an underground tunnel in almost complete darkness with all the light coming from a few dim lights in the ceiling and a night vision scope on the camera, reminiscent of similar scenes in last years sequel to28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition). This movie does not rely on cheap scares that any idiot can do, instead it slowly builds up tension and manages to keep its audience tense and scared throughout its entire running time.Believe the hype people, this movie not only lives up to the mystery and excitement of its trailers but surpasses them. This movie has all the potential to become the next great cult classic and join the ranks of horror greats from history. Move aside Godzilla, there's a new giant monster in town.Re-watch value; very high.",5,Godzilla on steroids,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,5841,"['When', 'reviewing', 'Cloverfield', 'obvious',

The monster is somewhat unique looking, the main actresses are very attractive and there are some pretty good effects and great scares in this.There's really not much of a story as after the initial monster attacks, three of the actors go to rescue the main guys girlfriend (Odette Yustman, ""The Unborn""), which leads to some good sequences.There are a few unexplained things as a lot about the creature is kept a mystery, the short running time does work in the movies favor as it was constant action with only a few slow parts.

658844,A3OH101U0CPUC7,B00005JPXY,Joseph Boone,"[4, 5]","Cloverfield focuses on a group of friends just prior to and after an attack on Manhattan by a giant monster. The entire film is presented as seen from a handheld video camera. As a viewer, you only see and hear what the friends and their camera does, so confusion and ignorance are the order of the day, just as the producers intended.Many of the basic concepts of Cloverfield were well conceived. Keeping the focus on a small group and seeing things from their perspective helps build suspense and mystery. When you do see it, the monster looks great and is as powerful as you could ask for. There's never any doubt that this thing is incredibly dangerous and scary, and it is not a clone of any previous monsters.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie left a lot to be desired. The video camera is always in motion, often spinning wildly around and around, bobbing, pointing at the ground, pointing at someone's shoes, out of focus, bouncing, and generally doing anything but just letting you lose yourself in the movie for more than a few seconds at a time. The cast is equally annoying as they are both stupid and unlikable even before the attack. The party scene at the beginning drags on for far too long and does little to make viewers care about the group. Once danger starts, they consistently put themselves in harm's way and do things that only a moron would consider.I wanted to like Cloverfield.

The sense of photo-realism is unique with the filming style (personal video unit perspective) but the behavior acting is not very realistic.  The acting is subordinate to the suspense plot. Special effects inject a setting of compelling surrealism.The compelling question in the acting drama is whether in extreme psychological situations the mind would choose irrational paths.  For example, since the video perspective is supposed to be an amateur eyewitness video log, what would compel a person to forgo natural and instinctive tendencies to self preservation and film events of such horrific personal and familiar devastation.  On the surface, it seems ridiculous.  Perhaps an exercise to rationalize it is overreaching.The characters are steered through a world destined to showcase their personal faults while snaring them in a constant life and death struggle.  It is, however, difficult to read any larger point or purpose into the unfolding of the drama than the rescue plot points.The gaps in story are provoking to the imagination.  Information is withheld the viewer as to causes and reasons.  If a person cares enough, it's a puzzle.  If they don't, it's a joke.The devastation theme is almost textbook catastrophe horror.

658850,A1LVZOK9F7K4CN,B00005JPXY,JR Pinto,"[1, 7]","Why Cloverfield works is because it gets right what so many monster movies get wrong.  I'm not talking about the Blair Witch gimmick - Cloverfield would have still worked without that.  Cloverfield is a good movie because it takes its premise seriously.  Yes, the idea of a giant monster destroying a city is inherently ridiculous, but so what?  The American Godzilla failed because Emmerich and Devlin didn't try - they just padded out their endless movie with lots of lame humor and watered-down scares.Cloverfield avoids the obvious pitfalls and clich&eacute;s of monster movies: the inept public official, the general who just wants to blindly shoot at the monster no matter what, the scientist who explains it all.  The premise defies rational explanation, so Cloverfield just skips that part.  It relies on the oldest trick in the book: creating characters who you care about.  (You think other filmmakers would catch on to that?)The story is about Rob, a yuppie New Yorker who is moving to Japan (inside joke) the next day.  Beth, his would-be girlfriend, shows up at his surprise party with another man.  They have a terrible fight and part badly.  Then something (possibly a terrorist attack) happens.  Beth calls Rob to ask for help - she is injured and can't move.  Rob then has to travel through the chaos to get to her.The gimmick in this movie works brilliantly.  All the footage is from a camcorder found ""in the area formerly known as Central Park.""  The brilliant thing about it is that the footage of the monster is ""recorded over"" the tape of Rob and Beth's first romantic day together, which allows for backstory.  (Watch the background when they are on the Ferris wheel.)  Yes, it is implausible that the camera is always on to catch just the right crucial information, but that is simply part of the premise.I find myself thinking about this movie much more than other such entertainments.  It is obvious that Rob loves Beth deeply and I was heavily invested in his quest.

658852,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B00005JPXY,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[2, 4]","In January of 2008, audiences were filled with anticipation about a newly released film that most knew essentially nothing about, other than the fact that something or someone is rampaging across New York City in the new thriller from producer J.J. Abrams (""Mission: Impossible 3"") called ""Cloverfield"". The high expectations surrounding this unknown film had been fed for quite some time via successful internet marketing campaigns that teased audiences about what may be coming soon to a theater near them. The film's release didn't disappoint, as soon-to-be fans arrived in droves to see what this mystery film was all about, delivering the 2008 box office year an incredible kick-start. Upon release of the film, word quickly spread that who or what was terrorizing New York was actually a gigantic monster and this film was being heralded as one of the most unique monster movies ever made. Now, ""Cloverfield"" has finally arrived on DVD and Blu-Ray, and after viewing the film, I find myself with a decidedly mixed feeling towards it.""Cloverfield"" focuses on a group of friends gathered together to say good-bye to one of their own as he prepares to leave for Japan to take on a new executive position at a successful company. However, their celebration is cut drastically short as explosions rock the city. Filled with fear, and an undeniable curiosity regarding what could have caused the explosions the friends head outside to see what they can discover. Unfortunately for them, and most New Yorkers, what they find is nothing short of the seemingly impossible, as a giant monster, as tall as the tallest skyscrapers, is rampaging through the city destroying everything in sight. Now, these friends are on the run for their lives as they try to find any place that is safe from the creature's wrath, all the while trying to find answers as to what the monster is and where it came from; however, no one, not even the military that is desperately trying to stop it, seems to have any clue whatsoever.Director Matt Reeves (TV's ""Lost"") chose a rather unique approach to ratcheting up the suspense-filled story of ""Cloverfield"" by opting for a significantly limited field of vision via the handheld camera that is used as the only visual source for the entire movie. The last time, that I can recall, this technique was done successfully was with the 1999 surprise horror hit, ""The Blair Witch Project"", so it was surprising to me that Reeves would opt for this same approach of using only one camera to tell the entire story. Many directors have chosen the handheld camera as their camera of choice, although usually utilizing more than one camera; a recent example would be director Paul Greengrass' chilling portrayal of the sad events of September 11th in the film ""United 93"". Whatever the reasons, the decision worked; even giving a person the feeling of being right there with the characters in certain scenes. In the end, audiences simply couldn't get enough of this movie, although the free-moving camera caused some audience members moments of discomfort due to motion-sickness, but even those instances would prove inconsequential in this film's massive success at the box office.The story for ""Cloverfield"" was written by Drew Goddard, another of J.J. Abrams' crew on the hit TV show ""Lost"", apparently Abrams wanted to keep things in house for this movie, a decision that may have helped keep the details of the film surprisingly quiet all the way up to the film's release to theaters. Goddard crafted a very suspenseful monster movie that managed to work even without showing the monster in full view until the film's closing moments. By relying on the reactions of his characters, and the devastation being done to the surrounding environments, Drew Goddard along with his director's choice for only using one camera managed to keep tensions high and interest piqued from start to finish throughout the incredibly fast-moving, but disappointingly short running time. This is where part of my mixed feelings towards this movie stems from, an average running time for a movie is in the range of 90 minutes to two hours; however, ""Cloverfield"" clocks in at 1 hour and 13 minutes of actual screen time devoted to story (which I felt ripped off by), with an additional 11 minutes of credits (no joke) that scrawl painfully slow across the screen to bring the overall run time to 1 hour 24 minutes, although considering that to be the official run time seems like cheating to me. Not to mention the abrupt ending to the film left me feeling like the movie was incomplete, which was of course a calculated move on the filmmaker's part to attempt to guarantee a sequel would be necessary to this movie, even though the box office receipts turned out to be high enough that a sequel became a no-brainer early on.Each member of the primary cast of ""Cloverfield"" now has the good fortune of having such a massive blockbuster on their r&eacute;sum&eacute; as their first official work in movies. Not bad for a bunch of newcomers, and for the most part each member deserves any good fortune that comes their way from this film, because most of them were surprisingly very good actors for not having much, if any, prior experience in film acting. The only truly disappointing member of the cast was the friend serving as the cameraman, and this was mostly because he was just so annoying with almost every line of dialogue he had throughout the movie, and sadly he was speaking in almost every scene because he was the character holding the camera for the duration. If the cameraman hadn't been such an annoying character, making surprisingly ridiculous comments that never helped matters in the desperate situation these friends have found themselves in, perhaps I would have enjoyed ""Cloverfield"" more definitively, instead of being so mixed on my thoughts of it.""Cloverfield"" is undoubtedly an entertaining monster film, and I would have to agree with the sentiment that it is possibly one of the best ever made; however, an extremely short running time along with too abrupt an ending, and an annoying cameraman/supporting character leaves me feeling somewhat cheated and unsatisfied by the experience.""Cloverfield"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",3,Needs A Sequel To Be A Complete Movie...,1212192000,"05 31, 2008",2008,6267,"['January',

658853,AFRZL05D54MPM,B00005JPXY,JWolf,"[0, 0]","The 2008 science-fiction thriller &#8220;Cloverfield&#8221; was written by Drew Goddard, produced by J.J. Abrams, and directed by Matt Reeves.  The film boasts one of the greatest hypes of all time; a teaser trailer was released during the previews to the summer-2007 movie &#8220;Transformers,&#8221; the title remained unknown until the second teaser which appeared before the fall-2007 movie &#8220;Beowulf.&#8221;  This is definitely one of those movies that keeps the heart racing.  I highly recommend adding it to your collection because, to really put the little and important nuances into perspective, you may have to watch several times.BACKGROUND:  Despite the online viral marketing, the actual plot for &#8220;Cloverfield&#8221; was well hidden.  Various websites popped up to preempt the film&#8217;s release, but the only sanctioned sites were &#8216;1-18-08.com&#8217; (which touted still-shots from the movie conveying panic and frenzy, yet kept fans guessing as to what might be the cause of such terror) and &#8216;[...]&#8217; (which provided a sneak-peak to an annihilated Manhattan as well as a clip of the monster&#8217;s roar).  To protect the screenplay, actors were auditioned with scripts not intended for use in the movie itself&#8212;the selected cast had no idea what they were getting into.  During production, the film was given several codename titles to conceal the identity of &#8220;Cloverfield.&#8221;Abrams credits his inspiration for the movie to a trip he took with his son to a Japanese toy store; he said he wanted to create an American counterpart to King Kong and Godzilla.  While filming, the &#8216;Cloverfield Monster&#8217; had not yet been incorporated, so the actors had to pretend they were scared of something else.  The monster&#8217;s final design is attributed to artist Neville Page; the creature&#8217;s rampage is caused by separation anxiety:  it is a young &#8216;monsterling&#8217; trying to cope with loneliness and an unfamiliar environment.One of the most noticeable things about &#8220;Cloverfield&#8221; is its cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; style, meaning that it is shot to look as if one of the characters is recording each of the scenes through a handheld camcorder.  While the cinematography accomplished an authentic feel, many were upset with the shaky-camera look, complaining that it gives a feeling of motion sickness.STARRING ROLES include:  Michael Stahl-David as Rob Hawkins, Odette Yustman as Beth MacIntyre, T.J. Miller as Hudson &#8220;Hud&#8221; Platt, Lizzy Caplan as Marlena Diamond, Jessica Lucas as Lily Ford, Mike Vogel as Jason Hawkins, Ben Feldman as Travis, and Billy Brown as Staff Sergeant Price.SUMMARY:  The United States Department of Defense is examining Rob&#8217;s camcorder of personal footage from the events from &#8220;Cloverfield;&#8221; most of the recording is time-stamped from 5-22-09, but because the camera was damaged, cuts from previous recordings appear throughout the movie.  A cut from 4-27-09 shows that Rob has slept with his good friend Beth.  On 5-22-09, Hud begins recording the going-away party (thrown by Lily and Jason) for Rob, who is moving to Japan.  Since their hookup, Rob and Beth have experienced a &#8216;falling-out;&#8217; Beth brings a date to the party which leads to an expression of animosity from Rob.  After Beth leaves the party, Manhattan experiences what feels like an earthquake.  They initially believe the flickering power is due to a capsized oil tanker that collided with Liberty Island.  All beliefs are suspended when they see that the head of the Statue of Liberty has been propelled into the streets of Manhattan; Hud catches his first glimpse of the monster.The Army National Guard has been deployed to combat the smaller menaces that appear to &#8216;bud&#8217; from the main monster.  A massive evacuation of Manhattan across the Brooklyn Bridge ends in turmoil when the monster tail-whips the bridge into smithereens.  Rob gets a voicemail from Beth saying that she trapped in her apartment; Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena venture to Midtown to free Beth.  While traveling through the subway tunnels, Marlena is bitten by one of the &#8216;budded&#8217; monsters.  The group reaches an army triage where they are warned of their closing timeline for saving Beth and the last chance to escape on an evacuation helicopter; once the last helicopter departs, &#8220;Hammer Down Protocol&#8221; will annihilate Manhattan.Once they free Beth, the group high-tails it to the evacuation site.  When their helicopter takes off, the first bomb is dropped on the monster.  Irritated, the monster swipes their helicopter from the sky.  Rob and Beth survive the crash and take shelter in Central Park&#8217;s Greyshot Arch.  The two use their final moments before the air raid to confess their love and leave testimonials on the camera&#8230;  [Not spoiling the ending, but pay attention to the final cut on 4-27-09, specifically the ocean in the distant background.]",4,Cloverfield,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,5009,"['2008', 'science-fiction', 'thriller', '8220', 'Cloverfield', '8221', 'was', 'written', 'Drew',

658854,A1AKQ1YUS4BT82,B00005JPXY,"Katie Babs ""Katiebabs""","[3, 5]","Cloverfield is a tragic love story. It begins with two lovers together and ends the same way. The first part of the plot is about giant alien destroying a city, but the subplot is about our hero trying to get to his heroine and save her.The movie starts with our hero, Rob waking up after spending a night with his friend Beth. Rob and Beth were friends but they finally have become lovers. The day is beautiful and these two are so happy. They even spend the day together at Coney Island. Fast forward to a month later. Rob has found a job in Japan and will be leaving to go work there. His brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily are throwing a goodbye party for Rob. Originally Jason was supposed to videotape the event, but he gives that responsibility to Jason's best friend Hud. Hud in turn has a bad crush on Lily's friend Marlena. Rob is surprised and a bit sad because this will be his last night in NYC and with that he must leave Beth behind. Something has happened in the past month because Rob and Beth are not talking. She comes to the party, they fight and she leaves.And this is where the story really begins. The alien monster comes along and begins to destroy everything in its path. Rob, Jason, Lily, Marlena and Hud all try to run and find safety in Brooklyn. They are almost home free when Rob gets a call from Beth. She is hurt, scared and maybe dying. Rob has a decision to make, either continue with his friends to freedom or go into the alien war zone and save the love of his life.Rob quickly decides he must go back and find Beth, regardless of the fact that he may die or that Beth could already be dead. Now I was thinking what is wrong with this guy?? In the immortal words of Monty Python- ""RUN AWAY!!"" But the simple fact is, what if it was your true love or if you were a parent and your child called you asking for help? Rob makes the decision and heads to Beth. Because Rob goes, Lily follows and because Marlena is good friends with Lily, she goes also and then there is Hud who because he is such good friends with Rob, will also come along and help his friend. (As for Jason, well Jason doesn't come). These four are now warriors going into a war zone where they may not come out alive. And this is where I realized the underlying story of this sci-fi movie is in essence a love story.We have a love story between Rob and Beth. We have a true love and friendship with Rob and his friend Hud and of course Lily who is good friends with Marlena. But this is a tragic love story so you probably can guess that some of these people won't survive. But what I can tell you is that our two lovers, Rob and Beth are reunited and end up together much like they way they were at the beginning of the movie. As they declare their love (which they never have said) for each others there is a possibility they may not survive.This is the type of love that we read in our romances, where the hero will die trying to get to his one true love and save her. And when the hero and heroine believe they maybe separated forever, that is when all feelings come to the surface and they passionately say ""I love you"". And honestly, that has to be the perfect way to go.Cloverfield, a love story?

658855,ANAM48GV9JS4C,B00005JPXY,Katie,"[3, 5]","I loved this movie.  Very interesting and the ""monster"" in it was super creepy looking.  You never find out what it is or where it came from, just that it can't be destroyed, at least by conventional methods.  No conclusion to the film really either.  But god it's fun to watch.  Better than ""I Am Legend"" in my opinion.For those who have complaints about this film.  First, I have Meniere's disease (extreme vertigo) and I didn't have a problem watching this movie.  And if I can watch it without getting sick or dizzy, then the average Joe should be able to as well.  Second, about the beginning being boring.  Yeah, it's not an action-packed film right from the opening scene, but you've got to give the reader a backstory to get them interested and vested in the characters so you care about what happens to them.  If you didn't know why would you care?I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because I think that the average movie goer would want some kind of conclusion or resolution to the film.  Like were they able to kill the monster, is there any chance of survival after the bombing, what did NYC look like when it was all said and done, etc.  My guess is they may have left it open perhaps for a sequel of some sort.Another reason to not give a full 5 stars is that when I first saw it I thought ""Blair Witch"" through the whole thing.  Very ""Blair Witch"" as far as film style.  It's just been done before that's all.Overall I think it'll be a cult classic hit - lots of people won't like this movie, but lots will and that will make it do very well overall.  We just got a PS3 and I can't wait to watch this movie on Blu-Ray with our 1080p big screen TV.

658856,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00005JPXY,K. Driscoll,"[9, 13]","There are many things being said about Cloverfield and most of them are good.  I don't want to retread many of the points other people have made, but because I saw this last night and absolutely loved it I'm probably going to cover some things that have already been said.  Suffice to say, Cloverfield, along with perhaps the South Korean monster movie gemThe Host, is without a doubt the best monster movie to come a long in a very long time.  Were it not for the persistent ""shaky"" camera work criticisms it's getting, I would expect Cloverfield's reputation to enter theJawsechelon in the coming years.  It had reached that degree of horror and suspense for me but time will tell.Cloverfield is intentionally framed in a very unique way.  The audience becomes aware that what they are watching is supposed to be real recovered footage taken on the film's main character's camera.  His name is Rob Hawkins and some of the earlier footage on the camera shows him with his girlfriend Beth.  The more recent footage shows a surprise going-away party in Manhattan that Rob's friends and his brother Jason threw for him after he got a promotion. He is ultimately relocating to Japan.  We find that Rob is no longer with his girlfriend at the time of the party, and just as Rob's friend Hud (the guy filming most of Cloverfield) and his brother talk him into patching things up with Beth, something goes very wrong in Manhattan.  What happens after we meet these people, and maybe even begin to care about them for 84 minutes, is where the horror begins. I'm not going to say anything else about the film, because it is entirely worth seeing without knowing anymore than I have already revealed.The comparison's to theWilliam Castle-like marketing gimmicks ofThe Blair Witch Projecta decade ago are fair comparisons in many respects, but given that movie's long-term unpopularity I think it is important to step in and acknowledge that Cloverfield is far different in many ways as well.  I firmly believe it will have great longevity.  It uses this sort ofCannibal Holocaust/Blair Witch Project style not as a way to market it to us as if it is real, but to merely place a monster movie in as realistic a frame as possible.  For that, it does work.  I don't think great acting was as necessary here for me because I wanted to believe it was real, so some of the acting that may have been bad was forgivable enough to forget.  Although, Lizzy Caplan who played one of the main characters Marlena was actually very good.  Call me a thrill-seeking cinephile searching hard for a scare, but I wanted to buy into Cloverfield and I was sold to it very quickly and very easily.  No reason to be cynical when all I came to see was a fun monster movie.  It is more than fair to say I got what I wanted.Many critics are also mentioning the parallels with the attacks on 9/11.  I think it wasEbertwho said the film ""evokes"" 9/11 and that is right on point.  It does evoke feelings during those attacks and I'm not sure if Cloverfield would have been filmed the same way without it.  For many young American's the only similar large scale tragedy we have seen was thru the lense of a news camera on the day of those attacks, and Cloverfield uses that effectively to force us to empathize with a city under attack by a gargantuan monster.  In Cloverfield we get the news coverage, the exploding buildings, the frantic behavior in not knowing what is happening and what could happen next, the poisonous dust from collapsed buildings filling the streets, and perhaps most iconic of all was the destruction of another New York landmark, the Statue of Liberty, which is handled by this monster in the exact same wayConan the Barbarianhandled Thulsa Doom.So there is more than one way to put this monster movie formula into a convincing paradigm and the makers of Cloverfield are quite resourceful in doing so.  The film also somehow managed to tell a nice little story.  There was a lot happening in Cloverfield and certainly more than enough to keep you very entertained for an hour and a half.  It was a great cinematic experience and I offer my highest recommendation.",5,Extremely Compelling Monster Movie,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,4150,"['are', 'many', 'things', 'being', 'said', 'Cloverfield', 'most', 'are', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'retread', 'many', 'points', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'made', 'saw', 'last', 'night', 'absolutely', 'loved', ""'m"", 'probably', 'going', 'cover', 'things', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Cloverfield', 'perhaps', 'South', 'Korean', 'monster', 'movie', 'gemThe', 'Host', 'doubt', 'best', 'monster', 'movie', 'come', 'long', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Were', 'not', 'persistent', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'criticisms', 'getting', 'would', 'expect', 'Cloverfield', 'reputation', 'enter', 'theJawsechelon', 'coming', 'years', 'had', 'reached', 'degree', 'horror', 'suspense', 'time', 'will', 'tell.Cloverfield', 'intentionally', 'framed', 'very', 'unique', 'way', 'audience', 'aware', 'what', 'are', 'watching', 'supposed', 'be', 'real', 'recovered', 'footage', 'taken', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'camera', 'name', 'Rob', 'Hawkins', 'earlier', 'footage', 'camera', 'girlfriend', 'Beth', 'more', 'recent', 'footage', 'surprise', 'going-away', 'party', 'Manhattan', 'Rob', 'friends', 'brother', 'Jason', 'threw', 'got', 'promotion', 'ultimately', 'relocating', 'Japan', 'find', 'Rob', 'longer', 'girlfriend', 'time', 'party', 'just', 'Rob', 'friend', 'Hud', 'guy', 'filming', 'most', 'Cloverfield', 'brother', 'talk', 'patching', 'things', 'up', 'Beth', 'something', 'very', 'wrong', 'Manhattan', 'What', 'meet', 'people', 'maybe', 'even', 'begin', 'care', '84', 'minutes', 'where', 'horror', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'entirely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'knowing', 'anymore', 'have', 'already', 'revealed.The', 'comparison', 'theWilliam', 'Castle-like', 'marketing', 'gimmicks', 'ofThe', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Projecta', 'decade', 'ago', 'are', 'fair', 'comparisons', 'many', 'respects', 'given', 'movie', 'long-term', 'unpopularity', 'think', 'important', 'step', 'acknowledge', 'Cloverfield', 'far', 'different', 'many', 'ways', 'as', 'well', 'firmly', 'believe', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'longevity', 'sort', 'Holocaust/Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'style', 'not', 'way', 'market', 'real', 'merely', 'place', 'monster', 'movie', 'as', 'realistic', 'frame', 'possible', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'great', 'acting', 'was', 'necessary', 'here', 'wanted', 'believe', 'was', 'real', 'so', 'acting', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bad', 'was', 'forgivable', 'enough', 'forget', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'who', 'played', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Marlena', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'Call', 'thrill-seeking', 'cinephile', 'searching', 'hard', 'scare', 'wanted', 'buy', 'Cloverfield', 'was', 'sold', 'very', 'quickly', 'very', 'easily', 'No', 'reason', 'be', 'cynical', 'when', 'came', 'see', 'was', 'fun', 'monster', 'movie', 'more', 'fair', 'say', 'got', 'what', 'wanted.Many', 'critics', 'are', 'also', 'mentioning', 'parallels', 'attacks', '9/11', 'think', 'said', 'film', 'evokes', '9/11', 'right', 'point', 'evoke', 'feelings', 'attacks', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Cloverfield', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'same', 'way', 'many', 'young', 'American', 'only', 'similar', 'large', 'scale', 'tragedy', 'have', 'seen', 'was', 'lense', 'news', 'camera', 'day', 'attacks', 'Cloverfield', 'effectively', 'force', 'empathize', 'city', 'attack', 'gargantuan', 'monster', 'Cloverfield', 'get', 'news', 'coverage', 'exploding', 'buildings', 'frantic', 'behavior', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'happening', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'next', 'poisonous', 'dust', 'collapsed', 'buildings', 'filling', 'streets', 'perhaps', 'most', 'iconic', 'was', 'destruction', 'New', 'York', 'landmark', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'handled', 'monster', 'exact', 'same', 'Barbarianhandled', 'Thulsa', 'Doom.So', 'more', 'one', 'way', 'put', 'monster', 'movie', 'formula', 'convincing', 'paradigm', 'makers', 'Cloverfield', 'are', 'quite', 'resourceful', 'doing', 'so', 'film', 'also', 'somehow', 'managed', 'tell', 'nice', 'little', 'story', 'was', 'lot', 'happening', 'Cloverfield', 'certainly', 'more', 'enough', 'keep', 'very', 'entertained', 'hour', 'half', 'was', 'great', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'offer', 'highest', 'recommendation']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

(Well, there wasn't ""really"" an ending but at least it stopped.) Normally you'd question why a movie was so short at only 87 minutes, but with this movie, that was 88 minutes too long.

The classic and contemporary Godzilla movies tell the story from the scientist and the army's perspective, never the little guy, only the big picture. ""Cloverfield"" focuses on those little guys and sells it by having the film done in blocks of ""real time"" video, which must be difficult to orchestrate on such mass extra fleeing-scenes. This is plenty brave to have a major picture without any major stars (another aspect that adds an edge of reality to the project), without music soundtrack (naturally, although Godzilla fans should stay for the end credits which include a revamp of the ""Tokyo Evacuation March"") and the boldest aspect: without a camera tripod. Like `em or hate `em there's little time to worry about that as the pace of the film is pretty rapid, and overall the film is a trim hour and a half (probably the best given the unorthodox visuals). Naturally, there's no ""big"" explaination offered or omniscient narration to clear things up, but honestly would the ""little guy"" really get one? I'm still waiting on the tidy epilogue following Katrina.The big question: How does the monster look?The Answer: Pretty cool, pretty original, but it really is less the point, than the reactions mand behavior of our fleeing cast. And just to make things creepy--er, there are smaller critters to be found in Manhattan in addition to the daddy-mama-monster.Again, ""Cloverfield"" is the tale of some survivors of a giant-monster attack, survivors who need some advice on how to behave in a monster movie:1.) Never go BACK into the city, during the evacuation2.) Never take the Subway tunnel to go BACK into the city during evac.3.) Once in the subway tunnels, follow the fleeing rats!4.) Monster bites are bad!5.) Listen to the army guys.6.) Don't try to video tape the entire event.Pre- or post film prep, check out the faux-Myspace pages of some of the major players.

Wonder if any of them will be able to get a job on the back of this film--I hope so, since no one is really bad, except for the jackass holding the camera, who proves that whatever Seth Rogen has, he's not sharing it with his peers. I looked up his name in the credits, says it's ""T. J. Miller,"" the sort of name female impersonators in the 50s used to go by to confuse nightclub patrons.

No one's superbad, ha ha, and a few of the actors actually rise to the challenge and give it a go.The best known actor, Mike Vogel, does a ""Janet Leigh"" here, which must have confounded all Vogel fans who paid good hard money to get into the theater!

Whaddya say, hmm?J.J. Abrams, master of wretched excess, produces, while Matt Reeves directs.  You recall Matt Reeves, right?  Me neither.  Part of the selling point on this film was that cinematographers used cameras you could buy at Target.  Perhaps this explains why the film is as noisy, visually hectic, and nausea-inducing as the footage of my best friend's kid's sixth birthday party.Six intellectually vapid, morally dismal Manhattan friends gather to see one of their number off to Japan.  We get hints of sex and alcohol, but before we see anything titillating, the building vibrates and the lights flicker.  Outside in the street, the head of the Statue of Liberty rolls like a bowling ball.  Then the carnivorous monsters appear.  We only lack Sigourney Weaver.We never clearly see the monster.  This is fine at first; it took a while to see the Alien and the Predator, too.  But the movie drags on, and all we ever see looks like an explosion at a taxidermy shop, always in soft focus, and I wonder how they spent the reputed $30 million budget.  At least those other carnivorous creature flicks rewarded our patience with something visible.The creature sheds fleas, which we see a little better.  These fleas are as big as mastiffs, and if one bites you, the military shoots you in a subway tunnel.  Huh?  This movie does lots, but explains little.  Nobody but Shirley Jackson has ever been able to maintain suspense while telling us nothing.  Are you Shirley Jackson?  Well are you?  No?  Then go sit at the back of the class.With its human angle, its obvious evocation of 9/11, and its intellectual ambition, I think the creative team had a vision for this movie.  Sadly, they lost that vision on the way to production.  This whole film looks like it was shot to create a trailer.  It's less a movie than a concept in search of a movie.

I have to admit, I was ready to exit the theater close to the beginning when the first sensations of something wrong occurred. I was glued after that. What I liked was that the giant beast that destroys New York story was told from behind a camera. What I didn't like was the same thing.I wish there were more and longer moments when the camera movement wasn't there. Only one scene, when the main characters encounter the beast in central park, where the shot is from a short distance and not from the hand held. It didn't last long, alas.However, I do highly recommend anyone who enjoys monster movies to see this one. It is well worth your time.

Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[4, 7]","Ever since we saw the teaser trailer for this film, ""Cloverfield"" has been something we've been waiting to see. More for curiosity then because the movie looked genuinely good, but hey, you have to admit that we haven't seen an advertising campaign like this in a long time. Imagine, an advertising campaign that made you WANT to see the movie! Gee, wonder why this movie did so well at the box office? Think Hollywood: What can we learn from this film? Anyway, despite all the hype and curiosity this film has garnered, it's not a great film. What it is is a great representation of the monster genre. A movie that targets a niche market, but is made well enough that it sheds some light on what the appeal to the genre is in the first place, and it doesn't make fans of the genre feel dumb for watching it.""Godzilla"" this is not, and the movie is better off for it. What the producers did to make their film unique to know that we don't go to these movies to be intellectually involved, we go to be entertained. So out goes the story, out goes the motivations, and out goes the history of why the monster is created. There are only two things you need to know: The characters are having a going away party, and a monster starts attacking the town, therefor rudely interrupting the characters fun. There, what else do you need to know? I guess I could tell you that the movie is filmed from a digital camera, that shakes and wobbles as if the person holding the camera has never held a camera before. The result may make those with queasy stomachs nauseous with motion sickness, so you might want to keep that in mind before seeing this movie in a theater.If there is an annoyance to be had in the film, a real annoyance, then I think it would be the motivation. Basically, the main character decides he's going to go deep into the city and save his girlfriend. The rest of the friends, as well as the camera, follow him. At some point you'd think they'd give up after little monsters pop up, military response fails to prove effective, and the bridge falls down. When they actually get to the girlfriends apartment complex they find it leaning on another building, and the main character decides he's going to go up there anyway. I know the movie needs to reach an eighty minute point, but this quest seems more and more crazy the longer it goes on.Even though this is a monster movie, the characters should have enough sense to know that the likelihood of succeeding in this quest puts the whole team at risk for a cause that seems doomed from the start. Ah, but now I'm contradicting my own advice. There is very little reason to care about the story, only the action. And what action there is, well it's very effective. Very intense and very scary at times. This is a movie you'll want to see in a theater, for no other reason then for the audience participation.Rating: ***",3,What Is Cloverfield?

658865,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00005JPXY,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[5, 10]","Perusing a number of reviews about this film, I've come to realize that a lot of people are giving it three or less stars because they felt that it was ""overhyped.""  However, after watching ""Cloverfield,"" I saw that it met my expectations as a somewhat experimental monster movie.  J.J. Abrams merely planted the seed last year with that brief glimpse of footage from what we would learn to be as Hud's ""documentary"" on the last night that his friend, Rob, would be spending in Manhattan before heading off for Japan.  It was the viewers of said clip who ran with it and created such a stir that a large portion of the population wanted to see this mysterious movie.  That's what you call good advertising in my book.  I praised ""The Blair Witch Project"" for doing the same thing a few years back even though that movie wasn't half as good as ""Cloverfield.""With that said, ""Cloverfield"" is just what it claims to be:  a monster flick shown from the point of view of a lowly citizen running for his life from a danger he knows very little about.  There is no great leader of the city to protect the people.  There's no young scientist to find a solution to the very big problem.  There's not even a cocksure military leader, just a couple of run-ins with soldiers almost as confused as the primary characters.  Does it work?  Yes.  Are there flaws?  Yes.  That doesn't stop the viewer from enjoying the film, however.Director Matt Reeves utilizes noise, chaos, uncertainty and pitch black scenery to get into the viewer's head.  On a number of occasions during the film, I caught myself trying to look around the corner of the camera in order to see what was happening.  Viewing the situation through the lens of a digicam makes the viewer seem to be a ""part"" of the action, even though everybody was securely tucked in their seats, most likely stuffing there faces with popcorn (I know I was).  Sure, one could argue that anybody with a little bit of common sense would drop the camera to help their friends, but then again, there wouldn't be much of a movie to watch, would there?Characters such as the goofy Hud (T.J. Miller), Lily (Jessica Lucas), and Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), draw genuine sympathy from the crowd as we learn just enough about them to care for them.  Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is likeable, but comes across as a bit selfish when the others are in danger.  Jason Vogel (Hawk) and Odette Yustman (Beth) are excellent in their roles, but aren't part of the primary group as long as the rest of the characters (don't let that revelation make you sure of their demise, either).Abrams also throws in a couple of twists on the traditional monster movie that weren't touched on in the film's trailers.  When you see them, you'll realize that there's even more to this film than one would think.Overall, ""Cloverfield"" does deliver on its hype and stealthy ad campaign.  I wonder if some of those who are upset with the film are really upset with themselves for getting pumped up over a movie that never truly revealed enough details before its release to give the viewer any specific expectations.  As stated before, this movie is nothing more than it proclaimed to be in the months prior to its release.  I highly recommend it to fans of monster movies, sci-fi flicks in general, and those who like to see a ""what if"" scenario come to fruition.",4,Perhaps It Was The Hype That Was Overhyped,1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,3355,"['Perusing', 'number', 'reviews', 'film', ""'ve"", 'come', 'realize', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'giving', 'three', 'less', 'stars', 'felt', 'was', 'overhyped', 'However', 'watching', 'Cloverfield', 'saw', 'met', 'expectations', 'somewhat', 'experimental', 'monster', 'movie', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'merely', 'planted', 'seed', 'last', 'year', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'footage', 'what', 'would', 'learn', 'be', 'Hud', 'documentary', 'last', 'night', 'friend', 'Rob', 'would', 'be', 'spending', 'Manhattan', 'heading', 'off', 'Japan', 'was', 'viewers', 'said', 'clip', 'who', 'ran', 'created', 'stir', 'large', 'portion', 'population', 'wanted', 'see', 'mysterious', 'movie', 'what', 'call', 'good', 'advertising', 'book', 'praised', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'even', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'half', 'as', 'good', 'Cloverfield', 'said', 'Cloverfield', 'just', 'what', 'be', 'monster', 'flick', 'shown', 'point', 'view', 'lowly', 'citizen', 'running', 'life', 'danger', 'very', 'little', 'great', 'leader', 'city', 'protect', 'people', 'young', 'scientist', 'find', 'solution', 'very', 'big', 'problem', 'not', 'even', 'cocksure', 'military', 'leader', 'just', 'couple', 'run-ins', 'soldiers', 'almost', 'as', 'confused', 'primary', 'characters', 'work', 'Yes', 'Are', 'there', 'flaws', 'Yes', ""n't"", 'stop', 'viewer', 'enjoying', 'film', 'however.Director', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'utilizes', 'noise', 'chaos', 'uncertainty', 'pitch', 'black', 'scenery', 'get', 'viewer', 'head', 'number', 'occasions', 'film', 'caught', 'trying', 'look', 'corner', 'camera', 'order', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Viewing', 'situation', 'lens', 'digicam', 'viewer', 'seem', 'be', 'part', 'action', 'even', 'everybody', 'was', 'securely', 'tucked', 'seats', 'most', 'likely', 'stuffing', 'popcorn', 'know', 'was', 'Sure', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'anybody', 'little', 'bit', 'common', 'sense', 'would', 'drop', 'camera', 'help', 'friends', 'then', 'again', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'movie', 'watch', 'would', 'there', 'Characters', 'such', 'goofy', 'Hud', 'T.J.', 'Miller', 'Lily', 'Jessica', 'Lucas', 'Marlena', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'draw', 'genuine', 'sympathy', 'crowd', 'learn', 'just', 'enough', 'care', 'Rob', 'Michael', 'Stahl-David', 'likeable', 'across', 'bit', 'selfish', 'when', 'others', 'are', 'danger', 'Jason', 'Vogel', 'Hawk', 'Odette', 'Yustman', 'Beth', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'are', ""n't"", 'part', 'primary', 'group', 'as', 'long', 'rest', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'revelation', 'make', 'sure', 'demise', 'either', '.Abrams', 'also', 'couple', 'twists', 'traditional', 'monster', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'touched', 'film', 'trailers', 'When', 'see', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'even', 'more', 'film', 'one', 'would', 'think.Overall', 'Cloverfield', 'deliver', 'hype', 'stealthy', 'ad', 'campaign', 'wonder', 'who', 'are', 'upset', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'upset', 'getting', 'pumped', 'up', 'movie', 'never', 'truly', 'revealed', 'enough', 'details', 'release', 'give', 'viewer', 'specific', 'expectations', 'stated', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'proclaimed', 'be', 'months', 'prior', 'release', 'highly', 'recommend', 'fans', 'monster', 'movies', 'sci-fi', 'flicks', 'general', 'who', 'like', 'see', 'what', 'scenario', 'come', 'fruition']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

The first time through, I was a little bit on the ""what the hell was that?"" side.  But I watched it again, and found that I really enjoyed it the second time.The realistic feel of ordinary people facing unimaginable circumstances really came through with the use of the whole ""handy cam"" shooting style.  However, I can totally understand how some might find this frenetic style difficult to watch, especially when most of us are used to traditional cinematography style of the static camera, close-up, wide shot, reaction shot with its many cuts between characters and straightforward storytelling style.  This, however, is undeniably messy, and for me, that's what makes it effective.  The very long, hand held shots must have been a marvel of choreography, and what cuts there are, are cleverly worked in and interwoven.Good casting of some relative unknowns.  When we're introduced to the characters at the party, it's almost like some indy film about 20-something relationships in NY which could have been kind of interesting just as that, but it really sets characters.  These folks are not heroes, nor are they particularly smart or brave.  In short, they're ordinary.  But then this catastrophic event happens and pushes them into making decisions and choices that were inconceivable just earlier that day.  And while surviving the rampaging monster is the catalyst, it's the relationships that take the film forward.  In particular, the scene where Rob must tell his mother about Jason is well done.For the most part, the effects are well done, and there are some great action sequences such as the race to get to the subway, and helicopter escape.  It's truly exciting and scary in places.  Great sound effects.  Are moments implausible?  Sure.

Other say it would involve a cthulhu.  Regardless, everyone wanted to see this movie, including me.Now, I do have to warn that the camera movements are extremely jerky.  If you liked *The Blair Witch Project* or even *Bourne Ultimatum*, then you'll enjoy the cinematic style here.  If you didn't, then stay away from this movie.Friends are throwing Rob Hawkins a farewell party, including his brother, Jason, because he has accepted a prestigious position in Japan.  Among those attending is Rob's ex-girlfriend, Beth.  The appearance has put a damper in Rob's mood.  Feeling the tension, Beth leaves the party.Oh, by the way, I left out the most important detail.  One of Rob's friend, Hud, has been handed the videocamera to record this party (and of course, throughout the movie).After some time pass in the night, the unexpected happens.  New York City is under attack.  The first thing that people see is the head of Lady Liberty tumbling through the streets of Manhattan.  Then, everyone is scrambling towards safety.While everyone is running away, a small group of friends, including Hud, Rob and Jason are going towards the chaos.  The reason is that Rob needs to rescue Beth, who is injured and trapped in her apartment.  Throughout the mission, we see, through the videocamera, glimpses of the monster and its man-eating spawns.I thought that *Cloverfield* was very clever to show this type of chaotic occurrence through a videocamera.  By doing this, we do not know where the monster comes from nor do we know why it is attacking.  We only get tidbits from the people's encounters with the military, trying to protect humanity.

658877,A2T049UQONS0OY,B00005JPXY,Larry VanDeSande,"[25, 34]","""Cloverfield"" is about equal parts 9/11, ""Godzilla"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"", with the latter providing the technical model, the center film providing the manifest content, and 9/11 providing the questions that are put forward and left unanswered by the film.If you haven't heard, ""Cloverfield"" is the story of a group of 20-something Manhattanites whose late night party is spoiled by the arrival of a monster in New York that goes around killing people, knocking over tall buildings, collapsing bridges and wrecking things a la Godzilla.The production is cleverly modeled after Blair Witch Project, with the entire 90 minutes of goings on filmed by a hand held camera. The computer-generated scenes of monsters, wreckage and the headless Statue of Liberty (check out the scene that comes up with this title) are all done very well. I doubt they took the computer-generated scenes then filmed them a second time with a moving camera to get the ship on the rolling seas affect; it was compelling however completed.The narrative story is full of exciting moments, one of which -- a moment where the hero has saved a damsel in distress and escapes midst up close warfare between the giant and the military -- left my heart pounding and my breathing accelerated when quiet returned in the theatre. The sound effects also work to the advantage of this actioner, which won't be very cogent when you see it on your television unless you have a screen at least 60 inches across.The storyline, as we know from films just like this one made half a century ago, isn't about an actual monster; it's about the war on terror. Just like the dinosaur that invaded New York in the 1953 sci-fi classic, ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"" -- which was a metaphor for communism -- the monster that invades New York this time is the reincarnation of the 9/11 terrorists come for a return visit.That beast from the 1950s was killed by the military and we were all saved from the ravages of communism. Here, the outcome is less clear. Because of the way the story is told, it is clear in the filmmakers mind that terrorists are winning this war, or at least making a dent in our way of life. Because of the way the movie ends, it is unclear if they think we (members of the good old U.S.A.) are making headway against our 21st century worldwide adversary.Even without the metaphor, ""Cloverfield"" is an exciting afternoon at the theatre and, for people prone to seasickness, a wild and dizzying ride. If you choose to see this film, and discount the supplementary metaphor, this movie won't make much sense and will leave you frustrated. When you put all the parts together, you'll see it's a contemporary story told pretty well in the clothes worn a half-century in our past.",3,3.5 stars -- do the terrorists win this time?,1200873600,"01 21, 2008",2008,2755,"['Cloverfield', 'about', 'equal', 'parts', '9/11', 'Godzilla', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'latter', 'providing', 'technical', 'model', 'center', 'film', 'providing', 'manifest', 'content', '9/11', 'providing', 'questions', 'are', 'put', 'forward', 'left', 'unanswered', 'film.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Cloverfield', 'story', 'group', '20-something', 'Manhattanites', 'late', 'night', 'party', 'spoiled', 'arrival', 'monster', 'New', 'York', 'killing', 'people', 'knocking', 'tall', 'buildings', 'collapsing', 'bridges', 'wrecking', 'things', 'la', 'Godzilla.The', 'production', 'cleverly', 'modeled', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'entire', '90', 'minutes', 'goings', 'filmed', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'computer-generated', 'scenes', 'monsters', 'wreckage', 'headless', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'check', 'out', 'scene', 'up', 'title', 'are', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'doubt', 'took', 'computer-generated', 'scenes', 'then', 'filmed', 'second', 'time', 'moving', 'camera', 'get', 'ship', 'rolling', 'seas', 'affect', 'was', 'compelling', 'however', 'completed.The', 'narrative', 'story', 'full', 'exciting', 'moments', 'one', 'moment', 'where', 'hero', 'saved', 'damsel', 'distress', 'escapes', 'midst', 'up', 'close', 'warfare', 'giant', 'military', 'left', 'heart', 'pounding', 'breathing', 'accelerated', 'when', 'quiet', 'returned', 'theatre', 'sound', 'effects', 'also', 'work', 'advantage', 'actioner', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'very', 'cogent', 'when', 'see', 'television', 'have', 'screen', 'least', '60', 'inches', 'across.The', 'storyline', 'know', 'films', 'just', 'one', 'made', 'half', 'century', 'ago', ""n't"", 'actual', 'monster', 'war', 'terror', 'Just', 'dinosaur', 'invaded', 'New', 'York', '1953', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'Beast', '20,000', 'Fathoms', 'was', 'metaphor', 'communism', 'monster', 'New', 'York', 'time', 'reincarnation', '9/11', 'terrorists', 'come', 'return', 'beast', '1950s', 'was', 'killed', 'military', 'were', 'saved', 'ravages', 'communism', 'Here', 'outcome', 'less', 'clear', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'clear', 'filmmakers', 'mind', 'terrorists', 'are', 'winning', 'war', 'least', 'making', 'dent', 'way', 'life', 'way', 'movie', 'unclear', 'think', 'members', 'good', 'old', 'U.S.A.', 'are', 'making', 'headway', '21st', 'century', 'worldwide', 'adversary.Even', 'metaphor', 'Cloverfield', 'exciting', 'afternoon', 'theatre', 'people', 'prone', 'seasickness', 'wild', 'dizzying', 'ride', 'choose', 'see', 'film', 'discount', 'supplementary', 'metaphor', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'will', 'leave', 'frustrated', 'When', 'put', 'parts', 'together', ""'ll"", 'see', 'contemporary', 'story', 'told', 'pretty', 'well', 'clothes', 'worn', 'half-century', 'past']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

658880,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JPXY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 9]","It took a while for ""Cloverfield"" to come to the Zenith City.  I am not sure if it has to do with the fact that we only have two movie theaters, both with ten screens apiece, or the fact that this particular chain has been fighting some of the studios over money (we had to wait over a month for ""Sweeney Todd"" to come to town.  So instead of going the first weekend I did not check out ""Cloverfield"" until today, which means I had seen the stories about how the movie was making physically ill because of all the hand held camera work.  Ever since the small craft searching for Luke and Han in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" came over the ridge and the landscape dropped away I have been away that such things in movies can make my head explode.  It is one of the reasons that I only saw the firstBournemovie in the theaters; I knew I could never make it through the other ones except on the small screen.  So what ever made me think I could happen ""Cloverfield"" is beyond me.Yes, this is all my own damn fault.  I should have gone directly to the back row of the theater, but I only went back about three-quarters, and when my daughter offered to buy popcorn I should have said ""No.""  I did make a point of not watching everything in the opening act of the film (i.e., before the head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the street), so that I could watch the good parts.  But it turns out that the good parts include the camera work most likely to make you look at that popcorn bucket as the world's most accommodating barf bag.  All told I probably watched a third of the movie, and half of that indirectly; however, I did listen to the whole thing and managed to sneak a peak at all of the key scenes while my head was spinning and chills went through my body (I have been listening to some of the radio dramas included in ""Twilight Zone: The Complete Definitive Collection,"" so I have recent experience with coming up with pictures in my head, even when it is spinning like a top).Basically, ""Cloverfield"" takes ""The Blair Witch Project"" approach to a giant monster movie.  For most people the only point of reference on the later will be ""Godzilla,"" which is pretty disappointing, but us older folk we can think back to not only the original ""Gojira"" movie, but ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"" and films of that type.  The film I am reminded most of is Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds,"" because it also keeps the focus on a small group trying to survive, with only the vaguest sense of what is happening; no multi-starred generals ordering troops to their deaths or scientists postulating on where the beastie has come from.  Our vantage point is a farewell surprise party for Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who is heading for a job in Japan.  His brother Jason (Mike Vogel), hands over the video camera to his bud Hud (T.J. Miller), and because of what the camera shows us we are able to pair the three boys up with three women: Lily (Jessica Lucas), Beth (Odette Yustman), and Marlena (Lizzy Caplan).  After midnight there is an initial explosion that has everybody running for the roof.  The next thing they know, everybody is running for their lives.Of course, any sane, rationale human being would ditch the frigging video camera early on once the world goes to hell in a hand basket, but Hud is not the brightest bulb in the world and in a world where everybody stops in the middle of a monster attack to whip out their cell phones and take pictures, there is a sense that documenting the end of the world as we know it could be a good thing.  So, yes, it is a conceit that becomes pretty unrealistic by the end, but without it, there would not be a movie (Besides, the stupidest decisions of the night belong primarily to the guilt-ridden Rob).  The bigger concern with such movies is how things hold together once the monster shows up; it was almost a given in 1950s black & white science fiction movies that once the monster showed up and we got to see what it looked like things would quickly head downhill.  I think the best part of the movie come before we see the creature, with all of those images reminiscent of 9/11, but I was not disappointed by what the CGI put together.  It is just that my preference for movie monsters are more the size of ""The Thing from Another World"" and ""Aliens.""The opening pretty much indicates how this is all going to end, and the movies runs less than 90-minutes, which was a blessing.

At least, you won't wake up feeling like you've been robbed of a piece of your life. This movie is REALLY BAD, HORRIFICALLY BAD. In fact, we're having a hard time coming up with the last time we saw a movie this bad. I see people, who thought this movie was an accurate portrayal of behavior that you'd see during an apocalyptic-type disaster -- seriously?! I didn't see any footage, hear, or read any stories of people acting this mentally challenged during 9/11. Let's hope that during such a disaster, real people won't demonstrate Darwin's theory in action by showing how the unfit remove themselves from the gene pool. The movie is full of unknown actors for a reason. The first third to half of the movie is a pathetic attempt to build suspense by wasting time with the irrelevant drama of the dating lives of a bunch of 20-somethings at a not-remotely believable ""going away party"" -- unrequited lust, ambivalence, love triangles, childhood sweethearts, no character depth, no one at all to care about in this low-budget sad excuse for a horror flick, and no suspense or thrill whatsoever. Some blithering idiot is handed a camcorder to record the guests' last good-byes and well-wishes to the guest of honor. Unfortunately, you end up having to watch the entire movie through the shaky lense of the camcorder held by this ignoramous, who'll inflict his kindergarten observations upon you throughout, making you wish he were the ""token black guy,"" who gets eaten in the first 15 minutes. Wait. There is no ""token black guy!"" Why not? Some silly formula could've helped this train wreck.  The most horrific thing about this movie is the blabbering numbskull with the camcorder. Really?? The WHOLE movie through a shaky handheld camcorder?! As with the victims of this C-rater, you spend 84 minutes wondering what the heck just happened, and never really knowing. A preposterous rescue and glimpses of what's coming to get them are so cartoonish and lame that we would've been better left wondering, imagining what it was, and flat dialogue such as, ""What was that?""  ""Something terrible. Don't look at it.""  ""What was that??""  ""Also, something terrible. Don't look at that, either,"" make you wish the whole cast had met their distrastrous fate 70 minutes earlier, if not sooner. Not scary. Not funny. 84 minutes we'll never get back.

658885,A2O91YORQH16L5,B00005JPXY,"Lee Say Keng ""KNOWLEDGE ADVENTURER/TECHNOLOGY...","[4, 8]","Last night, my gym buddy, feeling rather restless towards the evening, invited me to join him in movie watching.I recall having watched a fascinating teaser trailer of a sci-fi action movie, named 'Cloverfield' on cable television, where the Statute of Liberty had its concrete head blown off.So, we headed down to the Jurong Entertainment Centre together to watch the movie.The movie did not start off even with the movie title or the names of principal actors & actresses from the opening scene.All we could see at the very beginning segment was a quick flash-by placard showing 'Bad Robot', followed by captioned scenes of the Central Park in New York.There were some muddled messages about a video footage & the US Department of Defence.All this while, the movie had continuously very jerky & erratic images, as if we were watching a cheapskate home-made movie from a hand-held camcorder.All I could figure out was this scenario:A young guy, Hud, was apparently assigned to take some live video clips of a sending-off party for his best friend, Rob, who would be going off to Tokyo soon. Some of the party goers were given the opportunity to say something nice about Rob. The setting was Lower Manhattan, New York.His girl friend, Beth, suddenly appeared with another guy. There was a quarrel, & Beth left abruptly. In between, the camcorder went into rewind mode, where we could see fleeting images of Rob having a good time with Beth.Sometimes, we could see Hud focusing the camcorder on a beautiful damsel, who somehow fascinated him during the filming.All these captured as well rewinded images went on for some fifteen or twenty minutes.Actually, I was about to stand up & go down to the management office to give them a piece of my mind, thinking that their guy in the projector room probably screwed up something.Then, came some sort of a thundering earthquake, which apparently rocked the whole building, where the party was held. Naturally, I stayed back in my seat.Frightened, & puzzled, all the party goers went down to the streets. In the next moment, some tall buildings started to crash down. Sad images of the terrorist strike on the World Trade Centre flashed through my mind, as I watched the crumbling of skyscrapers.Strangely, our friend, Hud, continued to capture everything happening around him on his camcorder, while his close friends were desperately struggling to understand what was going on.For some split seconds, the camcorder actually captured fleeting images of something live, but definitely gargantuan, moving about in the background. What the hell was that, I was thinking. I was sure all those guys out there felt the same.The next scene was rather chilling, with the dislodged concrete head of the Statute of Liberty suddenly crashing & rolling on to the streets.Suddenly, amidst the chaos, everybody started to run &/or hide in a nearby supermarket. The streets were ripped apart. Worst still, the Brooklyn Bridge was eventually demolished by 'something out there'.The movie continued with the four or five original party goers on the run from 'something out there'.Hud, seemingly dedicated to his assignment, continued to capture every running &/or escape scene on film. He was adamant, as he felt that 'people gonna want to know . . . & how it all went down'.The next few scenes showed some soldiers appearing on the scene, with tank support, & battling the gargantuan creature lurking in the background of tall buildings.Then, Rob suddenly received a phone call from Beth. She was in trouble & needed his help, but her location was right inside the danger zone. Rob decided to back trek, to commence a frenzied search for her, against the wishes of his friends. For some strange reasons, the friends decided to tag along. They then moved precariously through the darkened subway tunnel, with rats running around, to reach Beth's location.Along the way, they encountered some fast-moving spider-like creatures in the underground.One of the lady friends got bitten quite badly.They finally reached the tall building where Beth was located. They went up to one of the top floors on foot, as the lifts were out of order. Rob eventually found Beth. Together with Hud, who continued to lug around with his camcorder, & another lady friend, they scrambled down the building very quickly to reach a helicopter pick-up point, as arranged earlier with the rescuing soldiers.Luckily, they made it to the two rescuing helicopters. From the hovering helicopters, they could see that the gargantuan creature was being blasted with bombs from military aircrafts.Unfortunately, that damned creature was still alive.All I could see subsequently was that one of the helicopters was chewed up by that monster. It then crashed into a grass patch, probably near Central Park. There were many dark images that followed, which I could not make sense of at all. Next, I could see the dark image of Hud's dead body, apparently with a twisted neck.Then, the whole movie just ended there & then, with credit titles starting to come up on screen.We walked out of the movie theatre, more dazed & lost than disappointed.Throughout the ninety minutes of movie time, the Godzilla-like monster was not actually seen in its entirety, only being viewed from different angles, as if the audience was supposed to piece everything together. Along with the monster, there were snippets of those little creepy spider-like monsters running around.The whole movie was quite disorienting. I still could not figure out what was all about. There were too many unanswered questions. There wasn't any proper closure.Acting-wise, all the actors & actresses were practically unknown, as far as my gym buddy & I are concerned.The cinematography, with all the jerky & erratic images from start to finish, was horrendous, to say the least.Come to think of it, there wasn't any music in the background, only ambient sounds such as creeks & thumps.Sometimes, I felt that the dialogue between the characters really drove me bonkers, e.g. ""Oh, My God, you know Superman, too? Geez, I'm feeling the connection . . . Have you heard of Garfield?""Until now, I still couldn't figure out the connection of the movie title, 'Cloverfield' with the theme or story plot of the movie.Surprisingly, this movie was a J J Abrams project, the same brains behind the 'Lost' & 'Alias' TV suspense series. A lot of viewers raved about them. To be frank, I hardly watch the two series, as I generally don't like to waste my time following story sequence week after week.All I can say is this. Human beings still possess redeeming values. Despite personal risks, as well as seemingly insurmountable odds, we sometimes will go all out to help our loved ones &/or other fellow beings in the pursuit of survival. Maybe, that's the principal message of the movie. I really don't know.On hindsight, I should have told my gym buddy to go & watch 'American Gangster', starring Denzel Washington & Russell Crowe.",3,"We walked out of the movie theatre, more dazed &

There is a little bit of everything in this movie; Some shots of the falling buildings and running crowds will unfortunately remind you of the 9/11 tragedy, so watch it at your own discretion. The small nasty looking creatures are similar to some oversized face huggers from the movie ALIENS and some shots in the movie will remind you of that. Yes there is virtually no explanation about the origins of the monster and it's actions, but this is not that kind of movie.

If you look it at as a stand-alone product, it may deserve 3 stars but if you take the concept and the things to come into account, it gets 5 from me.JJ Abrams is following his very successful LOST scheme - open endings, mysteries, hints. And he just re-invented the monster movie genre which I thought was dead. What could have come after dozens of Godzilla, The Thing, The Blob and so on movies? It was over.However, he made a refreshing start, entertaining the audience, making people curious for more.I see this movie as a - usually - small part of a monster movie. Remember the lost video footage found by the military at the beginning of this kind of movies? Not showing too much but giving you a glimpse of the monster.Well, that is this film in my understanding. But not only a short clip, it is nearly a full movie, but still parts are missing.What did I learn from this story? I know now a part of the story - only a part. But I want to know the whole story. What will I do? Watch the sequel.

I couldn't find any major plot holes.

658899,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00005JPXY,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[21, 32]","The real goal of any movie worth its salt is to draw us head-first into a reality that is not our own.  To help us inhabit new places, sometimes fantastic, sometimes harsh and gritty, but always powerful.  Stories are really beside the point.  So are easy answers and resolutions.  No movie that has ever made a truly lasting impression on anyone did so solely because it had a cool plot or a nifty twist at the end.  There's always something more there; something that makes you lose yourself for a moment and become someone else, somewhere else.The world has grown so jaded, and people so skeptical, that this isn't easy to do.  J.J. Abrams, ofLostandAliasfame, is a man with weird and wonderful ideas, and he has created in ""Cloverfield"" a movie that isn't deep or profound, but which resonates with powerful humanity, which ripples with very believable terror.  I haven't felt this enraptured and excited by a film since I was thirteen years old, back when I didn't care so much how meaningful and thoughtful a movie was, as long as it managed to grab me without letting go.I will say this right now: shame on you if you whine about the shaky camera work.  Boo to you if you moan about the lack of a plot.  And go soak your head if you complain about the frustrating lack of clear images or action scenes.  By now, you should already know that this flick is filmed documentary-style, through the lens of a single camera carried by one very confused and harried citizen of New York as that city undergoes attack from some unknown thing or things.  Those of you with tender tummies and a susceptibility to vertigo should stay away.Too bad for you, because you're missing one hell of a ride.  Universal Studios makes millions out of roller coasters designed to make us feel like we're in a movie.  Reality television shows have spent years pretending to showcase real people at their worst and best.  ""Cloverfield"" bypasses all of that with the most gorgeous ease, seducing you into a young man's going away party (he's leaving on the morrow to work in Japan, a clever nod to the Godzilla inspiration this movie banks on and surpasses), and then completely knocking the socks off of you with a series of horrific moments that are captured in the queasy, quake-y quaver of a handheld camera.It's a monster movie, first and foremost, but it's done in true J.J. Abrams style, with a flippant attitude toward anything but the common sense and scalding fear of the characters who are holding the camera.  There may be some who might harp about how unlikely it is that a single man would videotape the systematic destruction of New York for seven straight hours while his life is on the line; in a world where every cell phone has a camera and most people are dying for their chance to be in the frame, where news reporters place themselves on the frontlines of major wars just to catch a scoop, where websites like Youtube fester with millions of snippets of people being everything from goofy to grotesque, I say the movie rings quite true.  Besides, I say again, it's a monster movie.Like no monster movie I can recall seeing, ""Cloverfield"" provides what they all wish they could: the fear of really and truly being there.  The panicked confusion.  The hasty shock and dust-soaked amazement.  Monster movies of yore have tried to scare us silly by giving us the horrific grand view of things, when few besides superheroes and dictators ever experience life with the grand scheme of things in mind.  We are individuals, with our precious loves and single lives, and when New York rumbles with fireballs and fear, what really scares us is the threat to us and our loved ones.""Cloverfield"" sidesteps the grandiose issues of military might or radioactive origins.  It doesn't give us harried politicians wondering what's to be done.  It even pointedly avoids discussions of longterm, worldwide impacts.  ""What is that?"" one of the characters screams.  The cameraman, in one of the movie's best lines, dismisses the question by simply saying, ""It's a terrible thing.""Terrible it is.  Let the movie hold your hand, and it will usher you into that powerfully personal wonder and horror that so many of us forget can still exist.  Viewing this movie, I got sick, I was disoriented, I squinted to see through the fuzzy frames and the agonizingly distorted camera work.  It was hard to watch.I would turn around and watch it again in a second.

The advantage to a director or to a studio of making movies 'Blair Witch style' is that you don't need writers to make them; all you have to do is to find some talented actors and tell them, 'okay, you're really, really scared because of *topic*'.' and point a camera at them. The main weakness of this idea is that you can only make one of these movies (the Blair Witch Project itself) before everyone knows the magic trick and all the reasons why you should keep writing talent around become obvious.You don't need writers to make a movie like Cloverfield: you need them to make a movie like Cloverfield good.",1,You'll Root For the Monster,1213228800,"06 12, 2008",2008,2395,"[""'ll"", 'root', 'monster.Created', 'people', 'who', 'scared', 'bejeezus', 'audiences', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Cloverfield', 'same', 'idea', 'unseen/glimpsed', 'menace+scared', 'people+video', 'camera=movie', 'almost', 'adaptation', 'here', 'menace', 'part', 'taken', 'care', 'thirty-storey', 'Godzilla-knock-off', 'wanders', 'Manhattan', 'bit', 'monster', 'tourism', 'people', 'stuff', 'magically', 'whenever', 'plot', 'thin', 'laughable.Filmed', 'viewpoint', 'someone', 'who', 'barely', 'how', 'work', 'camcorder', 'Cloverfield', 'shot', ""'naturalistic"", 'way', 'believe', 'someone', 'will', 'hang', 'use', 'camcorder', 'bridge', 'collapses', 'military', 'counterattacks', 'being', 'chewed', 'Doberman-sized', 'monster-fleas.It', 'starts', 'loft', 'party', 'plot', 'rapidly', 'down', 'four', 'upscale', 'twenty-somethings', 'whom', 'average', 'moviegoer', 'shares', 'nothing', 'whatsoever', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'shallow', 'and/or', 'so', 'stupid', 'quickly', 'miss', 'point', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'save', 'leaving', 'only', 'point', 'interest', 'movie', 'how', 'quickly', 'monster', 'will', 'come', 'put', '*your*', 'misery', 'plot-sense', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'quickly', 'find', 'rooting', 'monster', 'monster', 'least', 'interesting.For', 'intents', 'purposes', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'created', 'genre', 'new', 'independent', ""'type"", 'movie', 'own', 'characteristics', 'one', 'Cloverfield', 'want', 'see', 'end', 'what', 'terms', 'plot', ""n't"", 'hopeful', 'natural', 'uplifting', 'exciting', 'way', 'surprisingly', 'even', 'believably', 'are', 'reasons', 'make', 'movies', 'way', 'none', 'treat', 'audience', 'friend', 'like', 'advantage', 'director', 'studio', 'making', 'movies', 'Witch', 'style', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'writers', 'make', 'have', 'do', 'find', 'talented', 'actors', 'tell', ""'re"", 'really', 'really', 'scared', '*topic*', 'point', 'camera', 'main', 'weakness', 'idea', 'can', 'only', 'make', 'one', 'movies', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'everyone', 'magic', 'trick', 'reasons', 'why', 'should', 'keep', 'writing', 'talent', 'become', 'obvious.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'writers', 'make', 'movie', 'Cloverfield', 'need', 'make', 'movie', 'Cloverfield', 'good']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

I realize the mistake was reading too much into negative reviews probably by the same people that would give  film like this 1 or 2 stars and a film like Paranormal Activity (that's barely a film btw)5 stars. Cloverfield although a shaky cam movie is the only one I can see having a legit reason to be shaky. The characters are running for their lives most of the time, they are always panicking, they use the camera as a tool like for light, and eventually start using it to document what they see. In this movie it actually makes sense to have a shaky camera and the shots although never clear make sense. This is the first person perspective of someone caught in a monster attack and that's what the movie is about.They show just enough of the creature to let you know that you do not want to be near it. The few shots they are seen of the creature explain more than enough about it. It's not like Godzilla 2000 where the creature is some mystery most of the time. It's revealed in a more interesting way. When everyone is running from the creature they barely see it only the damage it does but, once they start going towards the creature they see more of what it is. The plot is pretty foolish though in that it's about a group of friends running back into danger to find 1 girl that may or may not be alive even. The group does foolish things but I didn't find it to be annoying or that silly as people seem to complain about. Why? because all they really do is bring you to the action. Running away from the monster, fighting it, going into buildings, etc. etc. that's really about it. It's not like they're screaming and yelling at each other for 20minutes. They do scream and yell and argue BUT, the difference is it's when they're actually doing something interesting so your not paying so much attention to them as to what it is they are doing.This mostly is your typical monster movie but done with a much better and much more film worthy budget that makes it believable. That's pretty much what makes the movie good is that it's believable. Nothing that's too impossible ever really happens, and the worst thing I can think about is when they moved the girl who was impaled (that's usually the worse thing to do but hey, it's a movie and they were in danger). I liked Cloverfield and wish I watched it much sooner. The promoters did good for this show keeping the ""monster"" a secret and just showing clips of the chaos.

Unbelievable, silly, immature, frustrating, moronic characters, silly plot, bad acting, and the monster is tragically ho hum.The movie does not get going until about 17 minutes after the opening. You have to sit and watch a going away party for a friend, but it's more like a teenage romance gossip festival. The cameraman ""Hud"" tries to pick up his crush using middle school tactics and is so annoying you are hoping the monster eats him first. The character doesn't get any better. Hud spews out what I assume are bits of comic relief at unfunny moments in the movie all while holding on to the camera and recording.The actors continue to use the camera throughout the entire ordeal. The camera survives the monster attacking, crashes, burials, other monsters and other trauma. Who makes this camera? I want to buy one if it can stand this much punishment!The monster, when revealed, looks boring, uninteresting, and not frightening. Unusual, yes, but for some reason, not particularly compelling to look at. I went ahead and looked at some of the extras and was amazed and how much effort seemed to go into creating this monster, when the results were so bland.The acting from all cast members is disappointing and unbelievable; Hud especially. I never believed any of them were in NY running from a monster; I believed all of them were in a movie. I had to laugh out loud at one of the last lines of the movie when the guy points the camera to the girl and she says that she can't think of anything to say.The plot is awful.

The reason you not get involved in all that, fun as it may be, is because the film itself is the closest thing to a Midtown Manhattan roller coaster I've seen yet.Just like the old wooden coasters, the movie starts out with an almost overbearing handheld video of a going away party. It's as if you're waiting for the rest of the riders to get seated and buckled in. Then, the lights go out.For the rest of the film and without a single break, you are following a handful of party goers running for their lives to survive events they can't comprehend until they see for themselves that a skyscraper crushing beast has decided to visit the big apple.As if the single monster wasn't enough, it brought along some smaller friends who wind up being deadly hunters capable of tearing you apart and even if you survive with just a bite, they leave you with a final surprise.I highly recommend this movie and, if you have the time and interest, checking out the side story and online game because it opens up many interesting questions, quite like fans of Lost wind up asking at the end of every season. You've probably heard about the handheld camera work and though it can be as irritating as a home movie if you let it, the purpose is to immerse you into the lives of fleeing residents in a way which makes the film both haunting and exciting.The special effects are good and CGI integrates seamlessly with the film. Casting is okay, no big names, but a mixed bag of some very talented actors and actresses as well as a few who are no doubt destined to land roles in a B-movie or two before disappearing altogether.",4,"Excitement, Thrills, and Mystery",1213660800,"06 17, 2008",2008,1792,"['many', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'bodies', 'work', 'Cloverfield', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'movie', 'need', 'not', 'participate', 'online', 'Alternate', 'Reality', 'Game', 'series', 'comics', 'so', 'reason', 'not', 'get', 'involved', 'fun', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'closest', 'thing', 'Midtown', 'Manhattan', 'roller', 'coaster', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet.Just', 'old', 'wooden', 'coasters', 'movie', 'out', 'almost', 'overbearing', 'handheld', 'video', 'going', 'away', 'party', ""'re"", 'waiting', 'rest', 'riders', 'get', 'seated', 'buckled', 'Then', 'lights', 'go', 'rest', 'film', 'single', 'break', 'are', 'following', 'handful', 'party', 'goers', 'running', 'lives', 'survive', 'events', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comprehend', 'see', 'skyscraper', 'crushing', 'beast', 'decided', 'visit', 'big', 'apple.As', 'single', 'monster', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'brought', 'along', 'smaller', 'friends', 'who', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'deadly', 'hunters', 'capable', 'tearing', 'apart', 'even', 'survive', 'just', 'bite', 'leave', 'final', 'surprise.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'have', 'time', 'interest', 'checking', 'out', 'side', 'story', 'online', 'game', 'up', 'many', 'interesting', 'questions', 'quite', 'like', 'fans', 'Lost', 'wind', 'up', 'asking', 'end', 'season', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'handheld', 'camera', 'work', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'irritating', 'home', 'movie', 'let', 'purpose', 'immerse', 'lives', 'fleeing', 'residents', 'way', 'film', 'haunting', 'exciting.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'CGI', 'seamlessly', 'film', 'Casting', 'okay', 'big', 'names', 'mixed', 'bag', 'very', 'talented', 'actors', 'actresses', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'who', 'are', 'doubt', 'destined', 'land', 'roles', 'B-movie', 'two', 'disappearing', 'altogether']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release
658911,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005JPXY,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[0, 1]","I had no problems watching this film. I originally saw it at the cinema, and then again on blu-ray, and each time, I didn't feel sick, or dizzy. The majority of reviews on Amazon are one or two star reviews complaining about the camera, which quite possibly will put people off from seeing the movie. It's a film. It's a bit shaky. Get over it already.Normally, I do get put off by all the hype surrounding movies. All the teaser trailers (the statue of liberty's head lying in the street), the internet buzz, the fact that nothing was really given away before the film was released. Too much hype can ruin a movie in my opinion. But after seeing this at the cinema and on blu-ray, I have to say, I liked it as much second time round, as I did first time.I will agree with some other reviewers that the characters annoyed me. The only character I really liked was Marlena, played by Lizzy Caplan. (If you're thinking she looks very different from Janice Ian in Mean Girls - it's the same girl! And if anyone saw the cancelled second season of Tru Calling, she's in that too.) The rest of the characters irritated me majorly and were mostly unknowns.Some reviewers have compared to this to The Blair Witch Project. I hated Blair Witch project. It only got good in the last 10-15 minutes. What I will say about Cloverfield, is that it keeps your attention right the way through the movie, without failing once. The film is visually stunning, to begin with a leaving party, which is quite rudely interrupted. A couple of the scenes towards the beginning reminded me of scenes from 9/11. The monster was also extremely well done, quite often if you see a monster, all the mystery & intrigue is taken away, but it's only when it's actually caught on camera close up, that you realise all the brief glimpses throughout the movie doesn't do the monster justice. The one brief glimpse will have it burned into your brain forever. Put it this away, it's in the same ranks as the predator, the alien, all the other great movie monsters. Wow what a creature. It's like lots of different parts of other creatures!The first person viewpoint was an interesting concept, not something I thought worked in Blair Witch. You never really get to 'know' Hud that much, as you know the rest of the characters. He's only briefly seen compared to the rest of the characters, as he's always behind the camera. But since he had a bit of a thing for Marlena, it worked in that sense! And there's always shots of feet running, and very fast shots as the camera tries to catch everything that's going on. Put yourself in that position - you're not going to be running from a big scary monster, and stop to make sure the camera was off so you didn't record your feet? Or take your time to record footage on your left, when something more exciting is happening on your right? (For example.)The effects are amazing, and work well in cinema and on blu-ray. The only thing I really didn't like was the 'flashback' scenes. (The other footage on the video camera pretty much.) They were OK, but it just didn't work quite well in my opinion.Cloverfield is over very quickly, it seems, it passes in a breeze. After first watching in the cinema, I was not amused about walking down a dark road in order to get my bus home. Thankfully, I did jump as much as I did in the cinema when I saw the helicopter scene second time around.Overall I would recommend Cloverfield. Ignore the reviewers who complain about the camera - watch the film, emmerse yourself in the feeling that you're in control of the camera, and what you would do in that situation, and you'll get on quite well.",4,Stop complaining about the camera!,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,3638,"['had', 'problems', 'watching', 'film', 'originally', 'saw', 'cinema', 'then', 'again', 'blu-ray', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sick', 'dizzy', 'majority', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'star', 'reviews', 'complaining', 'camera', 'quite', 'possibly', 'will', 'put', 'people', 'seeing', 'movie', 'film', 'bit', 'shaky', 'Get', 'already.Normally', 'do', 'get', 'put', 'off', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'movies', 'teaser', 'trailers', 'statue', 'liberty', 'head', 'lying', 'street', 'internet', 'buzz', 'fact', 'nothing', 'was', 'really', 'given', 'away', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Too', 'much', 'hype', 'can', 'ruin', 'movie', 'opinion', 'seeing', 'cinema', 'blu-ray', 'have', 'say', 'liked', 'much', 'second', 'time', 'round', 'did', 'first', 'time.I', 'will', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'characters', 'annoyed', 'only', 'character', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'Marlena', 'played', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'very', 'different', 'Janice', 'Ian', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'same', 'girl', 'anyone', 'saw', 'cancelled', 'second', 'season', 'Tru', 'Calling', 'too', 'rest', 'characters', 'irritated', 'majorly', 'were', 'mostly', 'unknowns.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'compared', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'hated', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'project', 'only', 'got', 'good', 'last', '10-15', 'minutes', 'What', 'will', 'say', 'Cloverfield', 'attention', 'right', 'way', 'movie', 'failing', 'once', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'begin', 'leaving', 'party', 'quite', 'rudely', 'interrupted', 'couple', 'scenes', 'beginning', 'reminded', 'scenes', '9/11', 'monster', 'was', 'also', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'quite', 'often', 'see', 'monster', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'taken', 'away', 'only', 'when', 'actually', 'caught', 'camera', 'close', 'up', 'realise', 'brief', 'movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'monster', 'justice', 'one', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'will', 'have', 'burned', 'brain', 'forever', 'Put', 'away', 'same', 'ranks', 'predator', 'alien', 'other', 'great', 'movie', 'monsters', 'Wow', 'what', 'creature', 'lots', 'different', 'parts', 'other', 'creatures', 'first', 'person', 'viewpoint', 'was', 'interesting', 'concept', 'not', 'something', 'thought', 'worked', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'never', 'really', 'get', ""'know"", 'Hud', 'much', 'know', 'rest', 'characters', 'only', 'briefly', 'seen', 'compared', 'rest', 'characters', 'always', 'camera', 'had', 'bit', 'thing', 'Marlena', 'worked', 'sense', 'always', 'shots', 'feet', 'running', 'very', 'fast', 'shots', 'camera', 'catch', 'everything', 'going', 'Put', 'position', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'running', 'big', 'scary', 'monster', 'stop', 'make', 'sure', 'camera', 'was', 'off', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'record', 'feet', 'take', 'time', 'record', 'footage', 'left', 'when', 'something', 'more', 'exciting', 'happening', 'right', 'example', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'work', 'well', 'cinema', 'blu-ray', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', ""'flashback"", 'scenes', 'other', 'footage', 'video', 'camera', 'pretty', 'much', 'were', 'OK', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'opinion.Cloverfield', 'over', 'very', 'quickly', 'breeze', 'first', 'watching', 'cinema', 'was', 'not', 'amused', 'walking', 'down', 'dark', 'road', 'order', 'get', 'bus', 'home', 'Thankfully', 'did', 'jump', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'cinema', 'when', 'saw', 'helicopter', 'scene', 'second', 'time', 'around.Overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'Cloverfield', 'reviewers', 'who', 'complain', 'camera', 'watch', 'film', 'emmerse', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'control', 'camera', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'situation', ""'ll"", 'get', 'quite', 'well']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

Well, I wasn't even aware of the camera in ""BU"" as the story and performances were so solid. But from the minute that ""Cloverfield"" began I was more than aware that the character Hud (would parents really name their son after a disrespectful, often vile cad?), who was capturing all the action with a digital camera, was indeed filming. By that I mean the Hud's camera jerks, flips, flops...just as it would when an amateur is filming. So far so good. The camera movements make sense on a real-life level but all the putzing around of the camera made me physically ill...to the point that I had to look away several times as I thought I would barf.On the positive side: the physical production is amazing and the use of pretty much unknowns sets up a situation in which the moviemakers have to do their homework with the script, character-development-wise in order for us to invest our interest and time.There is nothing earth-shaking about the story per se: a monster attacks and goes about demolishing New York City while focusing on a small group of good looking young Lower Manhattan types who take flight as the monster goes about its rampage: everyone is beautiful, everyone is sensitive, emotional and humane which sets this film apart from others of its ilk: these people are young but they are smart, upwardly mobile and more importantly care for each other.

658914,A1VNYP0RD6VXIX,B00005JPXY,"Michael Hogan ""Constant Reader""","[4, 10]","First, I don't understand the barage of bad reviews because of the home video-like filming of the movie.  This was one of the most publicized aspects of this film!  This is not Godzilla or Alien vs. Predator or King Kong.  The movie was made to capture the plight of a group of people as they try to escape the wrath of a huge monster destrying Manhattan.That being said, this movie was better than I expected.  And that's saying something, because I was amped to see this since the preview in front of Transformers.I loved the home movie quality that started with a going away party for Rob.  A party that had the normal scenes of a guy (Hud) shyly chasing after a hot girl (Marlena) and the tension between a guy and a girl that are obviously in love but won't talk to each other (Rob and Beth).  Just as the Rob-Beth issue starts getting old, all hell breaks loose.  From that point on the film is incredibly intense.Glimpses of the monster are seen right away as it dismantles the city.  We get a few closer looks of the creature as our heroes rush through the city.  And I have to say, this monster is awesome.  Nothing like Godzilla, King Kong, or anything ever seen destroying a city.  I recommend watching the extras afterwards to hear the writer, director, and FX folks talking about it.Without going into plot, I will say that I loved the story-line.  Uncomplicated and straitfoward.  Clover (as the monster is referred to by the director) is on the loose and wreaking havoc.  Will our band of party goers make it out of the city?  Will the creature be defeated?  What the heck is the creature?  It doesn't matter.  This is one of the most original horror/thriller flicks in a long time.  Intense, scary, funny, gory, and intense (did I say that already).

I incorrectly predicted the monster's appearance based on a sketch, I correctly predicted that the movie wasn't about Cthulhu or Voltron, and then my son was born and I forgot about movies for a year.I finally saw it.  And man is it good.But you see, I'm a monster movie fan.  Cloverfield's marketing was intentionally minimalist, relying on viral marketing instead. One of the dangers of viral marketing is that it's viral, and thus doesn't necessarily distinguish by target market.  Indeed, the whole point of viral marketing is to get the word out to as many people as possible.  And many of those people aren't monster movie fans.Look.  This is a monster movie.  If you don't like the fact that attractive people run around screaming, maybe you shouldn't watch a movie about a giant monster.  If you don't like the shaky cam effect, maybe the preview gave a hint that the movie wasn't for you.  And if you don't like the unrealistic nature of characters running in high heels, people surviving horrible wounds, and the insane bravery/stupidity of the protagonist, perhaps you shouldn't see a movie about a giant monster that comes out of nowhere and rips the head off the Statue of Liberty.The joke's on us: Cloverfield is a love story cloaked in a monster movie. It's about the lengths our hero is willing to go to save his true love, a girl he's only just recently met.  In times of stress, our tenuous attachment to loved ones becomes all the more precious--if you lived in New York City during the 9/11 attacks, you knew that already.Stripping away the complaints about the genre, as a monster movie Cloverfield knocks it out of the park.  To Abrams' credit, it's just as scary as we feared.  Only now we have real reason to fear the impact of a colossal assault on our city.  The movie is filmed the way we experienced 9/11, and the floating papers and dust from the collapse of a building are a sign that we know exactly what a monstrous attack looks like.When 9/11 happened, I walked home from work.  I watched a cop stick his head out the driver's side window, so terrified of another attack from above that he was nearly drove off the road. Cloverfield invokes those fears: of confusion, of anarchy, of wanting to run but not knowing what's a safe place to run to anymore.  It is a monster movie made when the charm of monster movies can no longer be appreciated by the audience - we now know that if a giant monster attacked New York, evacuations would clog the streets, people would be poisoned by the debris, stock markets would crash, and worse.  It's not just about being afraid the monster will eat you.Cloverfield has its giant monster and lets it eat too: it's an immediate physical threat and a mysterious menace, far more frightening than anything the Godzilla remake could muster.  In the same way Godzilla evoked fears of the atom bomb, Cloverfield is 9/11 reimagined as a hideous, unexplained thing from beyond.  The film is also fearless in facing the monster (literally) and reinforcing the helplessness we all felt in the face of such a huge disaster.  Forget the boogeyman under your bed: it's hundreds of feet tall and smashing its way down your street.For monster movie fans, it doesn't get any better than this.",5,Have Your Giant Monster and (Let It) Eat Too,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,3329,"['so', 'many', 'other', 'monster', 'fans', 'was', 'taken', 'hype', 'Cloverfield', 'incorrectly', 'predicted', 'monster', 'appearance', 'based', 'sketch', 'correctly', 'predicted', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'about', 'Cthulhu', 'Voltron', 'then', 'son', 'was', 'born', 'forgot', 'movies', 'year.I', 'finally', 'saw', 'man', 'good.But', 'see', ""'m"", 'monster', 'movie', 'fan', 'Cloverfield', 'marketing', 'was', 'intentionally', 'minimalist', 'relying', 'viral', 'marketing', 'instead', 'One', 'dangers', 'viral', 'marketing', 'viral', 'thus', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'distinguish', 'target', 'market', 'Indeed', 'whole', 'point', 'viral', 'marketing', 'get', 'word', 'out', 'many', 'people', 'possible', 'many', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'monster', 'movie', 'fans.Look', 'monster', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'attractive', 'people', 'run', 'screaming', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'giant', 'monster', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'shaky', 'cam', 'effect', 'maybe', 'preview', 'gave', 'hint', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'unrealistic', 'nature', 'characters', 'running', 'high', 'heels', 'people', 'surviving', 'horrible', 'wounds', 'insane', 'bravery/stupidity', 'protagonist', 'perhaps', 'should', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'giant', 'monster', 'nowhere', 'head', 'Statue', 'Liberty.The', 'joke', 'Cloverfield', 'love', 'story', 'cloaked', 'monster', 'movie', 'lengths', 'hero', 'willing', 'go', 'save', 'true', 'love', 'girl', 'only', 'just', 'recently', 'met', 'times', 'stress', 'tenuous', 'attachment', 'loved', 'ones', 'becomes', 'more', 'precious', 'lived', 'New', 'York', 'City', '9/11', 'attacks', 'knew', 'already.Stripping', 'away', 'complaints', 'genre', 'monster', 'movie', 'Cloverfield', 'park', 'Abrams', 'credit', 'just', 'as', 'scary', 'feared', 'Only', 'now', 'have', 'real', 'reason', 'fear', 'impact', 'colossal', 'assault', 'city', 'movie', 'filmed', 'way', 'experienced', '9/11', 'floating', 'papers', 'dust', 'collapse', 'building', 'are', 'sign', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'monstrous', 'attack', '9/11', 'happened', 'walked', 'home', 'work', 'watched', 'cop', 'stick', 'head', 'driver', 'side', 'window', 'so', 'terrified', 'attack', 'was', 'nearly', 'drove', 'road', 'Cloverfield', 'fears', 'confusion', 'anarchy', 'wanting', 'run', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'safe', 'place', 'run', 'anymore', 'monster', 'movie', 'made', 'when', 'charm', 'monster', 'movies', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'appreciated', 'audience', 'now', 'know', 'giant', 'monster', 'attacked', 'New', 'York', 'evacuations', 'would', 'clog', 'streets', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'poisoned', 'debris', 'stock', 'markets', 'would', 'crash', 'worse', 'not', 'just', 'being', 'afraid', 'monster', 'will', 'eat', 'you.Cloverfield', 'giant', 'monster', 'eat', 'too', 'immediate', 'physical', 'threat', 'mysterious', 'menace', 'far', 'more', 'frightening', 'anything', 'Godzilla', 'remake', 'could', 'muster', 'same', 'way', 'Godzilla', 'evoked', 'fears', 'atom', 'bomb', 'Cloverfield', '9/11', 'reimagined', 'hideous', 'unexplained', 'thing', 'film', 'also', 'fearless', 'facing', 'monster', 'literally', 'reinforcing', 'helplessness', 'felt', 'face', 'such', 'huge', 'disaster', 'Forget', 'boogeyman', 'bed', 'hundreds', 'feet', 'tall', 'smashing', 'way', 'street.For', 'monster', 'movie', 'fans', ""n't"", 'get', 'better']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

What -- if every GAP model ever auditioned threw a party in a SoHo loft and suddenly found themselves thrust into a live action-anime Armageddon so laughably concocted that most of the z-listed trend-bots who grimace their way through this mess find career prolonging mercy in an early death.Cloverfield is a contemporary filmmaking cluster-f__K overdosing on shaky-cams, extemporaneous, exponentially stupid dialogue and plot-holes so cavernous that Mothra herself would be swallowed whole.And, c'mon Mr. Abrams, the cost-of-entry in this genre has to be a somewhat convincing monster. Would you have me believe that NYC is being eviscerated by a creature that apparently combines the physical characteristics of a Velociraptor capped by the head of the Munster's Al Lewis and a tropical fish in dire need of anger management... and while we're at it... some bare bones plausibility as well... would you also have me believe that our extremely pissed-off extraterrestrial can throw the head of Lady Liberty from New York Harbor to Spring Street on the fly and barely mark the pavement. After nearly ninety minutes the only horror in evidence is that this castrated eyesore was ever greenlighted.If Cloverfield were strictly a goof, all would be forgiven - however - there's a sulfuric whiff of a message interred within the comatose script - Japanese comeuppance or some such nonsense.

Hud is videotaping the events when all hell breaks loose outside in downtown New York.  Buildings fall down, others explode, and the Statue of Liberty's head comes rolling down the street.

Some may dislike the jittery camerawork, but it adds an immediacy to the story and makes you feel like you are in it.  The movie doesn't cheat either with shots of the monster.  It is shown in all its ugly glory a number of times from a distance and very close up.  It is like no movie monster previously, and it is a scared creature making its way through a strange world.

658922,AN8M401S8Y6DA,B00005JPXY,Mike Liddell,"[15, 20]","From a Marketing aspect Cloverfield was a huge success.  It cost 25 mil to make it and on opening weekend it grossed 40 mil domestically, which broke the record for a January release.  It dropped strongly after that and went on to gross 80mil in the U.S.The film is all about Rob, as one reviewer on here mentioned (Puzzle Box), Rob  could've been taken from the cast of the real world.  We see more of Rob in the film then we do of the huge cool monster that decapitates the statue of liberty.  At the beginning we see Rob with a hot girl, but, oh dear, now at his going away party a month later she shows up with another guy.  They have a little falling out and the hot girl and her guy Travis leave, while Rob's last words are good luck tonight Travis.  Rob's brother, his brother's girlfriend, and his best friend (who holds the camera) try to cheer him up, because even though all these people came to his party he is going to sulk in a corner and then go into his bedroom, this becomes a theme.All of a sudden Manhattan is attacked by the big cool monster mentioned above, and you guessed it Rob just can't let those be the last words he said to the hot girl.  In a nut shell it goes like this:  Dude, I like have to get to her dude.  Everyone feels so much pity for the little drama going on nobody seems to help anyone around them that could have glass in their grills.  SPOILER ALERT.  Rob's brother dies, he kind of looks upset for a second but quickly focuses on the hot girl again. To console his brothers girl he says at least you didn't say good luck tonight Travis to him.  Oh, there is another hot girl that gets bitten by something, Rob doesn't want to let her finish a soda because he's got to get to this girl he hooked up with once, soon her eyes start bleeding and she has to be killed by the military.  Rob's best friend is upset cause he wanted to hit it but Rob basically tells them, um dudes we gotta go to my girl, so they go and feel sorry for him along the way, not thinking at all about their parents or the big picture.The best friend delivers corny one liners seconds after family members deaths and right after the hot girl he's trying to have sex with just got half eaten by a thing spawned from the beast.  That's basically it, oh, and the girl he's gotten everyone killed trying to get too (even though there was a single file line out of the city by the military) was with another guy cause he didn't call her for months after they hooked up.The acting was actually good, but, was about a self absorbed, selfish guy who likes to say dude.  The monster and the mayhem were also cool.  If the movie didn't try to be so serious and went a 50s monster movie throw back with a real feel, then ok.  Or, if you want to make it serious give people that are somewhat likable, which can be done with little or no words, less words would have worked better.Instead of Cloverfield or what should have been called Rob and it's hour and 15min run time I'd suggest another recent release, the black and white version ofThe Mist (Two-Disc Collector's Edition).  It's wrapped in a 50's and 60's style monster movie along the lines ofNight of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition), and is filled with metaphors for much deeper issues and characters you care about.",2,"Smart Marketing..

Cloverfield is another attempt by America to do our own original monster movie. This time they used the found footage format to make it their own. Comaped to other American monster movies, I'd say that this is my favorite. Though, as I said the film has problems.One complaint I have is the found footage format. I like that they tried a different appraoch to making a monster movie, but it did not work for me. The camera was too shaky and did not focus on a shot long enough for the viewer to completely take in what was happening. Though I could buy it in the beginning, as the film went on, I found it hard to believe that they would not drop the camera.Another problem is the characters. I did not find them annoying, but I thought they were bland. I did not find one of them interesting. So when they died, I did not care.The effects were good. I thought that the design of the monster was cool and looked very original. There was a ton of hype surrounding this film when the teaser first came out.

Before he arrives, Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) records video testimonials from assorted guests, including party babe Lily (Jessica Lucas) and guarded semi-acquaintance Marlena (Lizzy Caplan).Snippets of conversation reveal Rob has never again contacted Beth (Odette Yustman), the girl from the opening scene, who summarily shows up with another guy -- much to Rob's distress. Just as the emotional steam from this conflict is ready to blow, all hell breaks loose outside and, after viewing the initial devastation from the roof, the hipsters put the party on hold in favor of saving their skins.This early action, as the group joins the panicking, confused and injured hordes on the dark streets, where the head of the Statue of Liberty has been unceremoniously dumped, is the best stuff in the picture; something dreadful is out there, but neither we nor the characters have a clue what it is until one of the characters exclaims, ""I saw it. It's alive!"" Rob, Lily, Marlena and Hud (T.J. Miller), now manning the camera, head for the Brooklyn Bridge, which the beast upends in spectacular fashion while showing a bit of its lizardly monstrousness in the process.Rob then insists they head uptown to try to save Beth, presumed to be in the high-rise building from the opening scene; Odysseus had an easy time of it compared to what these unprepossessing non-warrior types go through to reach their destination.Finding Beth with a piece of rebar sticking through her, they manage to all run to army helicopters to escape but do they?The movie works but comes with a guaranteed headache.",3,"""The Blair Witch Project"" meets ""Godzilla,""",1208995200,"04 24, 2008",2008,1739,"['Preparations', 'are', 'way', 'farewell', 'bash', 'Rob', 'Michael', 'Stahl-David', 'who', 'undoubted', 'nod', 'Godzilla', 'leaving', 'job', 'Japan', 'Rob', 'brother', 'Jason', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'records', 'video', 'testimonials', 'assorted', 'guests', 'including', 'party', 'babe', 'Lily', 'Jessica', 'Lucas', 'guarded', 'semi-acquaintance', 'Marlena', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', '.Snippets', 'conversation', 'reveal', 'Rob', 'never', 'again', 'contacted', 'Beth', 'Odette', 'Yustman', 'girl', 'opening', 'scene', 'who', 'summarily', 'up', 'guy', 'much', 'Rob', 'distress', 'Just', 'emotional', 'steam', 'conflict', 'ready', 'blow', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'outside', 'viewing', 'initial', 'devastation', 'roof', 'hipsters', 'put', 'party', 'hold', 'favor', 'saving', 'skins.This', 'early', 'action', 'group', 'panicking', 'confused', 'injured', 'hordes', 'dark', 'streets', 'where', 'head', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'been', 'unceremoniously', 'dumped', 'best', 'stuff', 'picture', 'something', 'dreadful', 'there', 'characters', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'one', 'characters', 'exclaims', 'saw', 'alive', 'Rob', 'Lily', 'Marlena', 'Hud', 'T.J.', 'Miller', 'now', 'manning', 'camera', 'head', 'Brooklyn', 'Bridge', 'beast', 'upends', 'spectacular', 'fashion', 'showing', 'bit', 'lizardly', 'monstrousness', 'process.Rob', 'then', 'head', 'uptown', 'try', 'save', 'Beth', 'presumed', 'be', 'high-rise', 'building', 'opening', 'scene', 'Odysseus', 'had', 'easy', 'time', 'compared', 'what', 'unprepossessing', 'non-warrior', 'types', 'go', 'reach', 'destination.Finding', 'Beth', 'piece', 'rebar', 'sticking', 'manage', 'run', 'army', 'helicopters', 'escape', 'do', 'movie', 'guaranteed', 'headache']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

OK, I totally get what the producers of this film were trying to do with the mock video style of the film. Unfortunately, it doesn't work most of the time. Some situations were completely contrived and didn't feel true at all. This totally goes against what the filmmakers were trying to conceive.The biggest problem with trying to make this look like it's really happening is.... we know it's fake! No matter what you do with or what camera you use, it's never going to be taken as real, So why not make the same movie only with good actors and using real cameras? The idea is good enough to stand up to a traditional style of film making. The image stabilization is really trying at times and really becomes more of a distraction rather than a useful tool. It would have been better to make the film in  normal process and switch to the video style in segments, like when a news cameraman is filming real news. It would have saved everyone a headache and we would get that down in the thick of it feeling that worked in this film.I did enjoy this movie, but I was equally frustrated, because I think they really missed a great opportunity to make a fantastic monster film!The DVD transfer is very good and there are a few interesting extras.",2,KILLED BY IT'S OWN DESIGN!,1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,1382,"['What', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'giant', 'monster', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'frustrating', 'movie', 'experience', 'OK', 'totally', 'get', 'what', 'producers', 'film', 'were', 'trying', 'do', 'mock', 'video', 'style', 'film', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'work', 'most', 'time', 'situations', 'were', 'completely', 'contrived', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'true', 'totally', 'what', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'conceive.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'trying', 'make', 'look', 'really', 'happening', 'know', 'fake', 'matter', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'camera', 'use', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'taken', 'real', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'same', 'movie', 'only', 'good', 'actors', 'using', 'real', 'cameras', 'idea', 'good', 'enough', 'stand', 'up', 'traditional', 'style', 'film', 'making', 'image', 'stabilization', 'really', 'trying', 'times', 'really', 'more', 'distraction', 'rather', 'useful', 'tool', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'make', 'film', 'normal', 'process', 'switch', 'video', 'style', 'segments', 'when', 'news', 'cameraman', 'filming', 'real', 'news', 'would', 'have', 'saved', 'everyone', 'headache', 'would', 'get', 'down', 'thick', 'feeling', 'worked', 'film.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'was', 'equally', 'frustrated', 'think', 'really', 'missed', 'great', 'opportunity', 'make', 'fantastic', 'monster', 'film', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'few', 'interesting', 'extras']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

This movie is innovative, even beyond ""Blair Witch"", because it wasn't exactly scripted.  The whole point of this movie is, basically, ""what would you do in a disaster of this magnitude?""Most monster movies are scripted and acted, and while this falls in our comfort zone, it isn't realistic.  Cloverfield was realistic.Okay, not realistic in that a giant monster is attacking New York.  It's realistic in how it's shot, and how it's experienced.  We're not seeing it through the eyes of a filmmaker and crew.  We're seeing it through the eyes of the people who are experiencing it.  The best way I can describe it is, chances are, if this had actually happened, that is exactly what we'd be seeing on the news.  Remember amateur videos of 9/11?  That's the ""technique"" that was strived for, here.Some are calling it out for having Rob go after his girlfriend and his friends following.  First off, there are some people in this world who would go after someone to try and save them in a crisis.  I know, if something similar happened, and someone I really cared about was trapped, I'd go after them.  I did once, in a serious Tornado (F5).  Crossed paths with it many times.  But we both made it out just fine.  So it isn't unrealistic.  Plus, Rob's friends chose to go with him.  They didn't have to, and he even told them not to.  But you have to think about this.  Somehow, the story had to be told.  Rob and his friends going after Beth was a great way to set up telling the story.  Because, let's be realistic... the story-telling device of any movie or TV show ever made is never that great.  Look at the 80's TV Show ""Murder, She Wrote.""  Some people don't understand how murder ""follows"" Jessica.  But if it didn't, then there wouldn't be a story for each episode, now would there?  It's exactly the same.

Somebody thought, let's make a monster mayhem flick but instead of a blockbuster make it an indie, shot amateur style: Godzilla meets the Blair Witch. That allows them to economize on the special effects, using sparing effects that would work on tv but not on the big screen -- but when shot on a consumer video camera by a guy who can barely keep it aimed long enough to get a clear picture who can tell the difference?As far as that premise goes, the film kind of works. It keeps you on the edge of your couch, it moves at a fast pace with a healthy balance between emotional drama and massive monster mayhem.The shoddy camera work does detract from the experience of watching it. I wish the filmmakers had come up with some reason to put the camera in the hands of a slightly more competent videographer. I understand that without hand held camera work this would be a different film -- and probably not novel enough to fly -- but I wish that they'd gone more in the direction of independent film handheld work (as in, say, the Dogme 95 films of Lars von Trier or Thomas Vinterberg or Harmony Korine) rather than the direction of ""totally clueless guy who for some reason never lets go of the camera but doesn't make much of an effort to point it in coherent ways.""The emotional drama of the film centers around a bunch of good looking 20 somethings who have all gathered to say farewell to a buddy who is going to Japan. It turns out he just slept with his gorgeous best friend and then, because he didn't know how to deal with their relationship before he left, decided not to call her again, but is extremely upset when she shows up to his party on the arm of another guy. His need to rush into extreme danger to save her didn't have the emotional pull for me that, say, the much better Korean monster flick The Host delivered in a family that pulls together to save their missing child. The problem here is that there isn't enough to show that the characters we are supposed to be rooting for are really all that likeable.In spite of all this, I had a good time watching the film. I do think that the ""do it yourself"" aesthetic of this film is intriguing and reveals a lot of possibilities that this film didn't exhaust.

I think it might have enjoyed this 'queasy cam' flick more than I might of, because I kept busting out laughing at the most inappropriate moments (whenever another of the hapless party goers bit it) thinking of Stan's dad repeatedly saying ""I'm so startled!"" while shooting film of the 'monsters' destroying South Park.Cloverfield has an interesting premise, and provides a unique take on the 'Godzilla' variant of monster movies. Many singing its praises reference its uniqueness as if unique things are inherently good because they are uncommon. I disagree completely. For a 'unique' film to also be a quality film, it needs to provide something VALUABLE that is lacking from more traditional presentations. While home video style hand cam footage does put the viewer right in the thick of things, I don't believe it actually does much to help tell the story more convincingly. A film (or any story for that matter) will always succeed or fail because of its characters, plot, and dialogue. A gimmicky shooting style may create a new ""look"" but it will not make a bad film into a good one.Cloverfield suffers more from story telling problems than anything else. It is hard to really engage with the characters, even though the first third of the film is devoted to sorting out their love lives. In my opinion, it would have been much better to simply start the movie at the point where the monster begins to attack the city and leave the audience to feel the panic of the faceless masses, and then introduce the characters as the story develops.Novelty can only take a film so far. To really be successful, it must do more than just provide an interesting gimmick.

Abrams, Matt Reeves' Cloverfield came out of nowhere (literally) to make itself known as a modern day monster movie smash.  Revolving around a group of young people in Manhattan caught in the middle of an attack by an otherworldly beast, Cloverfield is a success thanks to the ingenuity of everyone involved, and even more so because the film was so kept under wrap during production.  The filming technique may make you a little nauseous (though not nearly as bad on the small screen), but it is a decidedly effective way to present an otherwise tried and tired story, and puts some inventive and new spins on the monster movie genre.  It isn't anything spectacular in the least, and the lack of any sort of backstory is a bit of a disappointment, but Cloverfield is incredibly effective for what it is, and in that respect alone, the film is a treat.

658944,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B00005JPXY,Newton Ooi,"[0, 3]","By reading the other reviews, I get the feeling that many of their authors are basing their reviews of their experiences in the theater.  I have seen this movie on the small-screen only, and will state that the hand-held camera point-of-view of this movie is not that bad when seen on a 21-inch screen.  You still all the important details of each scene, without getting sick in either the head or stomach.Now to the story itself.  New York City is being wrecked by a 300-feet tall monster.  This creature has two short hind legs and two long front legs that also double as arms.  The creature's skin looks smooth and dark, and its head is long with teeth inside a horizontal mouth and what seems like two short horns; one beside each side of the mouth.  Overall, the monster has a general body outline of a stretched frog.  The monster does not breathe fire, or shoot anything out of any orifice, or fly.  But it does carry around multitudes of smaller creatures, each about the size of a large dog.  These smaller creatures look like gigantic locusts; they have skinny bodies with hard exoskeletons, six long jointed legs per body, and can crawl up walls and jump really high.  These smaller creatures are each armed with a long jaw full of sharp teeth, which they use to eat people.  At first, I thought they were offspring of the bigger monster, but then I watched the special features.  One of the special features basically explains that this 300-foot creature is an alien baby that crawled out of NYC harbor and into the city.  Like a human baby who has just come across a pen full of new toys, there is a lot of screaming, biting, kicking and knocking things over.  So with our baby monster; it knocks buildings over, bites people, and roars a lot.  The smaller dog-sized creatures are most likely parasites living on the skin of the bigger monster; like fleas on a dog.Now to the positives and negatives.  Positives first.  The monster looks real and original.  The special effects are wonderful.  The smaller insect-like creatures are really scary.  And the cast is comprised of unknowns, which is original for action flick.  Now the negatives.  First off, the US military seem hopeless when attacking the monster.  They miss a lot.  A lot of missiles end up hitting buildings.  Even at point-blank range, many of the tanks miss the monster.  Second, the main group of characters actually head towards the monster to find a friend instead of away from it.  Why not go around it?  Third, the ending sucked.  Essentially, we the audience are watching a playback of someone's home recording of a monster attack, and when the recording stopped, the movie ended.  It would have been nice to include some sort of epilogue; was the monster killed?  Was there only one of them?Some other features of this movie to know.  First of, there is no soundtrack, which I guess is appropriate given that this movie is basically one person's footage of a city's destruction.  Second, the movie's title, Cloverfield, is some codename given to the site of the monster attack by the US military.  Third, there are some bloody scenes, and the movie should be rated R, even though it is a PG-13.  And last, this is a short movie, under 1.5 hours in length.  Overall, its worth the time to watch it; though it is no monster classic like say King Kong or Godzilla.",3,Worth watching on DVD,1216857600,"07 24, 2008",2008,3349,"['reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'get', 'feeling', 'many', 'authors', 'are', 'basing', 'reviews', 'experiences', 'theater', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'small-screen', 'only', 'will', 'state', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'point-of-view', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'when', 'seen', '21-inch', 'screen', 'still', 'important', 'details', 'scene', 'getting', 'sick', 'head', 'stomach.Now', 'story', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'being', 'wrecked', '300-feet', 'tall', 'monster', 'creature', 'two', 'short', 'hind', 'legs', 'two', 'long', 'front', 'legs', 'also', 'double', 'arms', 'creature', 'skin', 'smooth', 'dark', 'head', 'long', 'teeth', 'horizontal', 'mouth', 'what', 'two', 'short', 'horns', 'one', 'side', 'mouth', 'Overall', 'monster', 'general', 'body', 'outline', 'stretched', 'frog', 'monster', 'not', 'breathe', 'fire', 'shoot', 'anything', 'orifice', 'fly', 'carry', 'multitudes', 'smaller', 'creatures', 'size', 'large', 'dog', 'smaller', 'creatures', 'look', 'gigantic', 'locusts', 'have', 'skinny', 'bodies', 'hard', 'exoskeletons', 'six', 'long', 'jointed', 'legs', 'body', 'can', 'crawl', 'up', 'walls', 'jump', 'really', 'high', 'smaller', 'creatures', 'are', 'armed', 'long', 'jaw', 'full', 'sharp', 'teeth', 'use', 'eat', 'people', 'first', 'thought', 'were', 'offspring', 'bigger', 'monster', 'then', 'watched', 'special', 'features', 'One', 'special', 'features', 'basically', '300-foot', 'creature', 'alien', 'baby', 'crawled', 'NYC', 'harbor', 'city', 'human', 'baby', 'who', 'just', 'come', 'pen', 'full', 'new', 'toys', 'lot', 'screaming', 'biting', 'kicking', 'knocking', 'things', 'So', 'baby', 'monster', 'buildings', 'bites', 'people', 'lot', 'smaller', 'dog-sized', 'creatures', 'are', 'most', 'likely', 'parasites', 'living', 'skin', 'bigger', 'monster', 'fleas', 'dog.Now', 'positives', 'negatives', 'Positives', 'first', 'monster', 'real', 'original', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'wonderful', 'smaller', 'insect-like', 'creatures', 'are', 'really', 'scary', 'cast', 'comprised', 'unknowns', 'original', 'action', 'flick', 'Now', 'negatives', 'First', 'US', 'military', 'seem', 'hopeless', 'when', 'attacking', 'monster', 'miss', 'lot', 'lot', 'missiles', 'end', 'up', 'hitting', 'buildings', 'Even', 'point-blank', 'range', 'many', 'tanks', 'miss', 'monster', 'Second', 'main', 'group', 'characters', 'actually', 'head', 'monster', 'find', 'friend', 'instead', 'away', 'Why', 'not', 'go', 'Third', 'ending', 'sucked', 'Essentially', 'audience', 'are', 'watching', 'playback', 'someone', 'home', 'recording', 'monster', 'attack', 'when', 'recording', 'stopped', 'movie', 'ended', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'include', 'sort', 'epilogue', 'was', 'monster', 'killed', 'Was', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'features', 'movie', 'know', 'First', 'soundtrack', 'guess', 'appropriate', 'given', 'movie', 'basically', 'one', 'person', 'footage', 'city', 'destruction', 'Second', 'movie', 'title', 'Cloverfield', 'codename', 'given', 'site', 'monster', 'attack', 'US', 'military', 'Third', 'are', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'rated', 'R', 'even', 'PG-13', 'last', 'short', 'movie', '1.5', 'hours', 'length', 'Overall', 'time', 'watch', 'monster', 'classic', 'say', 'King', 'Kong', 'Godzilla']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

HOWEVER. personally I LOVED this film!The idea of a monster film, shot entirely first person view point was a BRILLIANT idea! It completely takes you into the action, shows you the scale of things and what these characters are actually seeing! From the near beginning, where the person holding the camera (Hud) is trying to chat up his girl, it just seems so realistic, especially when he pushes through the crowd to ask her if she's alright! EVERY guy would do the same if he were trying to pick up that ONE girl. The view point also gives you the sneaky little shots of the monster that keep you intrigued, and the camera is usually a second too late to see the action. The noise occurs the camera whips around and we see the aftermath or destruction.Also adding to the recorded on a standard video camera we see little glimpses of a month before, detailing Rob and Beth's relationship each time the camera is stopped.

I saw the movie 9 times in the cinema and NEVER saw it! but then agaijn it's little more than a black dot in the distance...Now for those who question the thin plot, you watch it on BLU RAY with the special investigation mode. It gives you SO much more depth of where the monster came from, who's responsible for it and where it came from! IT'S FANTASTIC!!You see after I heard they were doing a sequel I was surprised because I didn't think there was enough groundwork for another one, but after watching that special feature I am SO looking forward to it!!!The funniest thing I've heard from many people I know, is that the camera movement made them sick! which I guess it's possible... but personally I have VERTIGO and have had it since 2005 and I was fine with this film... but don't mention 'A Scanner Darkly' to me.... I do get sick from the slightest of things... so I'm surprised this film had no effect on me!PERSONALLY with all the hype after the release of the first trailer with the transformers movie I think it was one of those few examples that actually delivered!!

The trailer image of the head of the statue of liberty coming off is sure to go down in movie history. The production is done from the point of view of a camcorder that one of the party members has. So the entire film is done in first person POV. I found this really interesting and fun but the rollercoaster effect might not be pleasurable for all but aside from that possible weakness, this film is sheer monster madness. The film makers are having a bunch of fun having people running scared as this massive fiend rips buildings apart and shakes the ground, pounds the army and gets it back just as rough. It is like one big extended action sequence throughout its whole running time. If you like this sort of thing, then go for it.

The entire movie is shot with a hand held camera which can be a little nauseating at times.The Good: The concept of the movie was actually very good. Two ideas that had been done before were combined for a fresh take on each. The acting was decent all around. There are some really well played intense moments in the movie. The special effects were done well. They actually did a decent job of building the characters stories in short order.The Bad: I think there needed to be a little more interaction with the monster. I know it was shot to look authentic but I think some steady cam shots in the movie may not have been a bad addition and would have been a nice break from the headache inducing hand held.Overall: ""Cloverfield"" is a decent movie with some good intensity.

Likely a major one.  As the entire film is shot through a camcorder that one of the main characters (who is running for most of the movie) is holding, there are more ""wobbly"" scenes than not.  Does this take away from the film?  Maybe.  However, the idea of seeing this unexplained destruction through the eyes of a person just like us is fascinating enough to convince me that the headaches were worth it.  It might not be so for you, and I think that needs to be addressed.Second, be ready for an amazing script.  Drew Goddard (Buffyalum) is at the top of his game, taking us effortlessly from dire soil-your-pants scenes to laugh-out-loud moments without missing a beat.  With dialogue like ""Cloverfield"" has, you'll certainly be quoting the one-liners very often.Lastly, the execution of the script and the `idea' of ""Cloverfield"" is very impressive.  We get enough clear looks at the monster in question to satisfy the audience, but the true brilliance of this movie is that there is no explanation offered for the monster.  There is no ""he came from space"" or ""he burst forth from the deepest pit of the ocean"" nonsense.  The information we get is what we would get if we were in the main character's shoes, and that's the whole point of the movie.  I think it's fascinating.So with a script this good and an idea so interestingly executed, I think this movie is definitely worth the (inevitable) headache.7/10",4,You'll Get a Headache...

658960,A2NT656K8QYTX3,B00005JPXY,"PDC ""PoeBoy""","[1, 3]","When my wife and I first saw this film we emerged from the theater into the chill night feeling shell-shocked and drained.Both of us had been blindsided by the experience, not having imagined, going in, how a film about a giant monster loose in Manhattan could possibly provide the basis for a truly thrilling or even remotely scary film experience. Well, boy were WE wrong.I gather that a significant number of folks posting reviews here do not agree with me in this assesment. But, hey, that's why filmgoing is a subjective experience.For me, the reason 'Cloverfield' is an instant classic, and a truly unique cinematic event, is because it throws out all the rules of conventional narrative -- yes, at the same time borrowing a few aspects from other films in the process -- and simply plunging the audience headlong, and often without explanation, into a nerve-jangling nightmare of apocolyptic proportions.Spielberg, in many ways, set the scene, tonally speaking, with his more conventioanlly constructed 'War Of The Worlds' in 2005. That provided a template for how a microcosmic view of macrocosmic events -- often without the relative comfort of rational explanations -- could effectively pull the psychological rug out from under an audience, subjecting them to a primal, child-level fear of the unknown.And now, building on Spielberg's earlier apocolyptic invasion by forces beyond our understanding or experience, director Matt Sherman and producer J.J. Abrams have created an even more nightmarish experience by entirely stripping away a conventional narrative approach and having the whole experience viewed through the unblinkingly harsh lens of a home-video camera.This device has been previously -- and most famously -- used by the makers of 'The Blair Witch Project', and, subsequently, by the original makers AND re-makers of Rec./Quarantine. And, in each case, this was a very effective choice, absolutely intrinsic to the impact of the narrative and to its feel of queazy immediacy.But only in the case of 'Cloverfield' has this intimate and claustrophobic device been applied to the telling of truly EPIC events. And that was 'Cloverfield's creative masterstroke.Of course, the ultimate blue-print for this approach was first introduced to the world in the many indelible home-video images of 9/11 and its aftermath. Never before had the world witnessed such monumental destruction in such an intimate and immediate way -- personal hand-held video-diaries of Armageddon.And, because of the utilization of this narrative device, coupled with the related removal of any musical score, the audience is thus removed from its typical movie ""comfort zone"" and subjected to a much more raw experience -- a million miles away from anything so quaint and comforting as giant monsters destroying Tokyo.In one fell swoop kid-stuff becomes vid-snuff!And my hat is off to the entire creative team on this one for creating the most believable CGI world I've ever seen. Believable because ""invisible"" in the sense of not drawing attention to its own existence.Even in the brilliant realization of the creature itself, the wise decision of not letting the audience get too protracted or clear a look was crucial to the overall feeling of nightmarish reality the filmmakers were going for.And they succeeded in spades, even if the resulting experience was too jarring, offputting, and uncomfortable to translate into massive box-office blockbuster status.Folks, this is simply NOT your Dad's monster movie.Nope.'Cloverfield' is a whole new animal.",4,MONSTER M.A.S.H.,1242864000,"05 21, 2009",2009,3551,"['When', 'wife', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'emerged', 'theater', 'chill', 'night', 'feeling', 'shell-shocked', 'drained.Both', 'had', 'been', 'blindsided', 'experience', 'not', 'having', 'imagined', 'going', 'how', 'film', 'giant', 'monster', 'loose', 'Manhattan', 'could', 'possibly', 'provide', 'basis', 'truly', 'thrilling', 'even', 'remotely', 'scary', 'film', 'experience', 'Well', 'boy', 'were', 'WE', 'wrong.I', 'gather', 'significant', 'number', 'folks', 'posting', 'reviews', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'assesment', 'hey', 'why', 'filmgoing', 'subjective', 'experience.For', 'reason', 'instant', 'classic', 'truly', 'unique', 'cinematic', 'event', 'out', 'rules', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'yes', 'same', 'time', 'borrowing', 'few', 'aspects', 'other', 'films', 'process', 'simply', 'plunging', 'audience', 'headlong', 'often', 'explanation', 'nerve-jangling', 'nightmare', 'apocolyptic', 'proportions.Spielberg', 'many', 'ways', 'set', 'scene', 'tonally', 'speaking', 'more', 'conventioanlly', 'constructed', ""'War"", 'Worlds', '2005', 'provided', 'template', 'how', 'microcosmic', 'view', 'macrocosmic', 'events', 'often', 'relative', 'comfort', 'rational', 'explanations', 'could', 'effectively', 'pull', 'psychological', 'rug', 'audience', 'subjecting', 'primal', 'child-level', 'fear', 'unknown.And', 'now', 'building', 'Spielberg', 'earlier', 'apocolyptic', 'invasion', 'forces', 'understanding', 'experience', 'director', 'Matt', 'Sherman', 'producer', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'have', 'created', 'even', 'more', 'nightmarish', 'experience', 'entirely', 'stripping', 'away', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'approach', 'having', 'whole', 'experience', 'viewed', 'unblinkingly', 'harsh', 'lens', 'home-video', 'camera.This', 'device', 'been', 'previously', 'most', 'famously', 'used', 'makers', ""'The"", 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'subsequently', 'original', 'makers', 're-makers', 'Rec./Quarantine', 'case', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'choice', 'absolutely', 'intrinsic', 'impact', 'narrative', 'feel', 'queazy', 'immediacy.But', 'only', 'case', ""'Cloverfield"", 'intimate', 'claustrophobic', 'device', 'been', 'applied', 'telling', 'truly', 'EPIC', 'events', 'was', ""'Cloverfield"", 'creative', 'masterstroke.Of', 'course', 'ultimate', 'blue-print', 'approach', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'world', 'many', 'indelible', 'home-video', 'images', '9/11', 'aftermath', 'Never', 'had', 'world', 'witnessed', 'such', 'monumental', 'destruction', 'such', 'intimate', 'immediate', 'way', 'personal', 'hand-held', 'video-diaries', 'Armageddon.And', 'utilization', 'narrative', 'device', 'coupled', 'related', 'removal', 'musical', 'score', 'audience', 'thus', 'removed', 'typical', 'movie', 'comfort', 'zone', 'subjected', 'much', 'more', 'raw', 'experience', 'million', 'miles', 'away', 'anything', 'so', 'quaint', 'comforting', 'giant', 'monsters', 'destroying', 'Tokyo.In', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop', 'kid-stuff', 'becomes', 'vid-snuff', 'hat', 'entire', 'creative', 'team', 'one', 'creating', 'most', 'believable', 'CGI', 'world', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Believable', 'invisible', 'sense', 'not', 'drawing', 'attention', 'own', 'existence.Even', 'brilliant', 'realization', 'creature', 'wise', 'decision', 'not', 'letting', 'audience', 'get', 'too', 'protracted', 'clear', 'look', 'was', 'crucial', 'overall', 'feeling', 'nightmarish', 'reality', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'going', 'for.And', 'succeeded', 'spades', 'even', 'resulting', 'experience', 'was', 'too', 'jarring', 'offputting', 'uncomfortable', 'translate', 'massive', 'box-office', 'blockbuster', 'status.Folks', 'simply', 'NOT', 'Dad', 'monster', 'movie.Nope', 'whole', 'new', 'animal']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

Don't be fooled, though... that's just the set-up, and it really helps to pay attention to all the details (if only to try to keep all the names straight, later.) It doesn't take long before all hell suddenly breaks loose, and you are convincingly sucked into the chaos and panic of the emergency that ensues.Not to be too much of a spoiler, but I particularly enjoyed the touch of having the film being represented as a ""found"" going-away party tape, which happened to accidentally erase most of an earlier, date movie made by one of the main characters... this really helps to flesh out the personalities and adds to what is a surprisingly deft character development for this type of film. (Hint--pay attention when the unerased parts of the earlier video peep through.)I also appreciated the fact that when things really hit the fan, the viewer never knows much more about what's going on than the movie's characters. This really adds to the suspense, and draws you emotionally into their viewpoint, and the immediacy and confusion of their plight. Also helpful is the lack of a dramatic or trendy hit-laden film score. Though they may have lost in after-marketing, they gained in atmosphere, and realism.One warning though-- if you didn't like the jerky hand-held camera and the you've-got-to do-some-thinking-to-know-what's-happening aspect of, say, the Blair Witch Project, then you won't like this flick either. Some people get downright queasy when the camera isn't balanced by those expensive studio gyros, y'know? And maybe also when they actually have to think things through, rather than just sitting & screaming at splattering blood and severed body parts.To wrap up, I thoroughly enjoy this DVD-- It's a keeper. The story line is surprisingly well planned and executed, especially considering the relatively small budget. And the writers don't insult the viewer by ""explaining"" everything at a jr-high school level, as so many films do these days. The acting is actually quite good, for the most part (again, a pleasant surprise). The, um, ""critters"" are well conceived, well represented, and pretty damned convincing.The only real complaint I've got with this film is minor, and probably directly due to the budget limitations-- there's a rather obvious inaccuracy regarding the size of the statue of liberty's head-- you'll know what I mean when you see it.",5,A pleasant (and creepy) surprise,1256860800,"10 30, 2009",2009,2789,"['hype', 'pro', 'AND', 'con', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find', 'one', 'most', 'intelligently', 'written', 'sc-fi/horror', 'flix', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.There', 'bit', 'subtle', 'social', 'satire', 'buried', 'lines', 'pretty', 'fair', 'amount', 'incidental', 'humor', 'well', 'particularly', 'early', 'party', 'sequence', 'indication', 'just', 'being', 'boring', 'yuppie', 'tweens', 'trouble', 'yawner', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'just', 'set-up', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'details', 'only', 'try', 'keep', 'names', 'straight', 'later', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'before', 'hell', 'suddenly', 'loose', 'are', 'convincingly', 'sucked', 'chaos', 'panic', 'emergency', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'spoiler', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'touch', 'having', 'film', 'being', 'represented', 'found', 'going-away', 'party', 'tape', 'happened', 'accidentally', 'erase', 'most', 'earlier', 'date', 'movie', 'made', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'personalities', 'what', 'surprisingly', 'deft', 'character', 'development', 'type', 'film', 'Hint', 'pay', 'attention', 'when', 'unerased', 'parts', 'earlier', 'video', 'peep', 'also', 'appreciated', 'fact', 'when', 'things', 'really', 'hit', 'fan', 'viewer', 'never', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'going', 'movie', 'characters', 'really', 'suspense', 'emotionally', 'viewpoint', 'immediacy', 'confusion', 'plight', 'Also', 'helpful', 'lack', 'dramatic', 'trendy', 'hit-laden', 'film', 'score', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'after-marketing', 'gained', 'atmosphere', 'realism.One', 'warning', 'did', ""n't"", 'jerky', 'hand-held', 'camera', ""you've-got-to"", ""do-some-thinking-to-know-what's-happening"", 'aspect', 'say', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'flick', 'people', 'get', 'downright', 'queasy', 'when', 'camera', ""n't"", 'balanced', 'expensive', 'studio', 'gyros', ""y'know"", 'maybe', 'also', 'when', 'actually', 'have', 'think', 'things', 'rather', 'just', 'sitting', 'screaming', 'splattering', 'blood', 'severed', 'body', 'parts.To', 'wrap', 'up', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'keeper', 'story', 'line', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'planned', 'executed', 'especially', 'considering', 'relatively', 'small', 'budget', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'insult', 'viewer', 'explaining', 'everything', 'jr-high', 'school', 'level', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'do', 'days', 'acting', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'again', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'um', 'critters', 'are', 'well', 'conceived', 'well', 'represented', 'pretty', 'damned', 'convincing.The', 'only', 'real', 'complaint', ""'ve"", 'got', 'film', 'minor', 'probably', 'directly', 'due', 'budget', 'limitations', 'rather', 'obvious', 'inaccuracy', 'regarding', 'size', 'statue', 'liberty', 'head', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'see']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

658963,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B00005JPXY,P. Hardy,"[4, 9]","Introduction: The very first impression Cloverfield is bound to give many viewers, is a return of Roland Emmerich's 1998 adaption of Toho's IconicGodzillaor maybe even a run of the mill teen-horror film, due to the youth of its actors and actresses your won't recognize unless you've watched certain television shows or movies. Better yet, if your fan of ABC's long running series LOST and you know who the producer is, then you bound to believe that its connected to the series itself. That said, I was among the many who caught the teaser trailer when it premiered in theaters the three days afterTRANSFORMERSwas released July 3d 2007. I thought it was sequel to Godzilla. However, the only thing Cloverfield has in common with anything mentioned above is that its produced by J.J. Abrams and is, more or less, a homage to Giant Monster movies of old. Because lets face it, monster movies are made as often as westerns are now-a-days if you don't include the latter's small revival this and last year.Plot: Filmed in the style of a home movie, Cloverfield begins on the day of April 27th. Rob Hawkins (Michael-Stahl David) and Beth (Odette Yustman) McIntyre are awakening from a night spent in her father's apartment in the Time Warner Center. On the spur of the moment, Rob decides to take Beth to Coney Island. The video then fast-forwards to May 22nd. Lily Ford (Jessica Lucas) and Jason Hawkins (Mike Vogel) are preparing a farewell party for Jason's brother, Rob, who is departing for Japan after being promoted to vice-president of a Japanese company he works for. Originally burdened with job of recording testimonials (farewell) messages for Rob, Jason carts the job off to his brother's friend, Hud Platt (J.T. Miller), who reluctantly agrees to take the job with the promise of his long-time crush, Marlena Diamond (Lizzy Caplan), coming to the party at the behest of Lily. When Rob and his best friend, Beth McIntyre arrive to party, the film reveals that Rob has slept with Beth and thus created a rift between them, by shunning her (so to speak). Jason and Hud go to ""comfort"" Rob about the situation, but their attempt to console him is suddenly interrupted by a mysterious earthquake. When the group travels to the roof to inspect the situation, they are caught off guard by an explosion that sends flaming debris down on them and the statue of liberty's head rolling into the streets of New York shortly thereafter. The group attempts to leave the city via the Brooklyn Bridge, but the bridge is attacked by a hulking creature of a indescribable nature. Against the pleads of his friends, (who eventually decide to follow him), Rob decides to go after Beth after receiving a distressed phone call from her despite the danger lurking inside the city.Overview: The storyline for Cloverfield is simplistic and straight forward; The beginning, specifically plays out like an episode of TheWB's Felicity (a tale of troubled relationships, romantic advice, and unrequited crushes). It never tries to dazzle you with an explanation to the events occurring in the film. Its told completely from the point of view of the civilian, thus there's no suitable explanation beyond the speculation of the characters. I think this is one of the things that works to the film's advantage. The lack of explaning as to what's happening keeps the film from being bogged down by the disbelief that most Monster movies are regarded with. If you didn't follow the movie's then-contagious Viral Marketing Campaign, then you'll may or may not be confused on some points. The atmosphere that surrounds the film is, at first a welcome lure of security and complacent within itself. Quite honestly the first half hour will have you wondering why you bothered to watch Cloverfield in the first place. Rest assured, once the main event begins, it will catch the viewer off guard --- destroying the security the film established in the beginning. Confusion and fear will be your companion and the lack of explanation only intensifies an already frightening situation.Directed by Matt Reeves (writer/director for The Pallbearer (1996), and TheWB'sFelicity), Cloverfield moves fast and hard once it gets started, but is severely lagged down by its half hour introduction of the main players of the central storyline, which I think words to advantage in some ways. Without it, you really wouldn't couldn't care whether or not the characters, already established in their personalities and lives, would live or die. (Depending on the person.) Which begs the question as to why it wasn't just a half-hour longer. Nevertheless, Reeves' straightforward direction works to the movie's advantage. As mentioned a dozen times before, Cloverfield is filmed and performed to something akin to[The] Blair Witch Project (1999), utilizing the amateurish camera work and crooked camera angles. However its quality its on par with that of the general motion picture image. Clear, mostly unfuzzy and not so frenetic or sloppy.The Visual/Special effects implemented in the film by Double Negative (Batman Begins, Shaun of the Dead) and Tippett Studio (Consantine, The Spiderwick Chronicles) are fantastic. While there are obvious moments where the FX is plainly obvious, they managed to make their CGI blend in near-seamlessly with the real world environment of ""New York City"". The creatures (designed by Neville Page) themselves, the centerpiece of the film, are amazing. The photo-realism of their appearance are brilliantly crafted and the greatest achievement in the movie overall. One notable aspect of Cloverfield is the lack of an Orchestral Score. The closest to a soundtrack that this film has is several pieces of popular pop/rock singles played in the background of the farewell party in the beginning. The only actual score featured in the film is the ""ROAR! (Cloverfield Overture)"" by Michael Giacchino (LOST, Speed Racer), a powerful and romantic orchestrated theme that serves as a nod to the late Akira Ifukube's Godzilla (Gojira) Theme of 1950's without sounding terribly like it.When concerned with the performances from the actors in the movie, I half expected them to be the weakest part of the film. While it may take a second viewing to fully appreciate the acting, I was pleasantly surprised by how well everyone did in this film. This group of little known actors, consist of the likes of Jessica Lucas (Life as we Know it, CSI, The Covenant), Lizzy Caplan (CBS' The Class, andMean Girls), Mike Vogel (Poseidon, Grounded for Life, 2003'sThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre[Remake]), Michael Stahl-David (NBC's terribly irsh-ganster-cliched The Black Donnellys), stand-up comedian T.J. Miller (ABC's Carpoolers) and Odette Yustman (UPN's South Beach, and ABC's October Road). All of which give way-above ""average"" performances in their respective character roles. What will be held against them of course (besides being worthy of being Magazine Ad models) is the fact that most of their performances consist of sobbing, running and screaming at the monster lurking in the dark. But even when their doing this, their performances come off as believable and natural. Something I appreciated in the aforementioned TV series, Felicity.The natural performances from the large cast of actors; The ability to come off as genuine while in the guise of their characters for four long seasons. This sort of acting translates excellently in the film. The actors many have been charmed by, is the semi-recognizable Lizzy Caplan (arguably the only vetran-character actor, first to Mike Vogel) and T.J. Miller; Their chemistry, comedic chops, and rapport on-screen pays off in more ways than one, most likely due to the heavy use of improvising. Performances I was particularly concerned with were the ones coming from Jessica Lucas and Mike Vogel, both of which have starred in movies where I never paid too much attention to them in. Jessica Lucas, more than proves that she is worthy of becoming of a brilliant actress with her under appreciated performance as Lily Ford. While Mike Vogel, as usual, is far too convincing in the role as the laid back and rather lazy older brother of Rob Hawkins, Jason; a man who hands out ""wiser-than-you-should be"" advice to his troubled younger sibling. Its one of his better performances despite his lack of screen-time, certainly not one to be ignored. And before I forget, Michael Stahl-David and Odette Yustman (the focal characters of the film), give great performances as estranged friends (or lovers) struggling to reconcile their differences in the middle of an unexpected disaster.Overall, Cloverfield is an excellent film that falls into the ""love it or hate it"" category. Its certainly not for anyone looking for an straight-forward monster-movie in the way of Godzilla and King Kong, especially if your think of it as an ""Gimmick(y)"" sort of film. For me, all the elements utilized in Cloverfield fell into place and left quite the lasting impression on my memory. My biggest problem with the film, falls down to its length. Once you realize how short it is, you'll wish it was longer. And with the word of mouth already spread about the general public about this film, in the end, your enjoyment of Cloverfield will probably come down to your ability to suspend your disbelief and how well you can stand a film not filmed in the proper motion picture style. A highly recommended movie.  --- [4 out of 5].",4,"...Approximately Seven Hours Ago, some thing attacked the city...I don't know what it is...""",1226016000,"11 7, 2008",2008,9425,"['Introduction',

It was more of a Blair Witch than a monster movie.  I was expecting more destruction and feedback from what was happening in outside sources, tv and radio.  There is a little input, but the action focuses on 3 people.  I frankly was lost as to who they were and who they were looking for.  As for pace in this movie,  I get better pacing in the paranormal activity movies.  This movie is like the first time I learned to drive a clutch with rapid action scenes followed by slow talking scenes.  The previous(flashback) footage on the tape does not help the movie after the initial scenes.  I understand the need to establish the relationship with the woman that are after, but there such a thing as too much.Final Verdict:  The title is as vague as this movie's plot and the monster doses not give a payoff.

In fact, I felt that one of the film's strengths was an excellent sense of timing throughout.  There was just enough footage of the party to give you a basic idea of the relationships between the main characters, and then the action began, driving all of them to the rooftop and from there to the streets.  I put the DVD in just to watch a few minutes before grabbing dinner, and ended up watching it all the way through, and I felt it was tight, edited well, and the pacing was just right.I also reject the notion that the hand-held camera was too obtrusive or too shaky.  I thought it leant a sense of realism to the movie and I didn't find it to be distracting or even all that noticeable after you watch for a few minutes.I loved the big action sequences and didn't feel they were overly violent or bloody. The smaller monsters who drop off the big guy were creepy and in a lot ways more scary than the main one.The unknown or little-known actors did a very good job and unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find them annoying or unlikeable.

The effects are so good that it is astounding just how realistic they really are. It is far easier to capture convincing special effects on film than it is in high resolution video formats like the ones used for this movie. It looks like New York city is literally being destroyed by a gigantic bizzare creature that towers over New York's tallest buildings. The destruction of massive buildings and surrounding areas appears so realistic that it looks just as real as the footage we have all seen of the twin towers being destroyed. This alone is an amazing accomplishment. What is not so convicning is the fact that what we see as the audience is presumed to be captured by a single person on a single video camera.

658973,A1THEQV9LKFN35,B00005JPXY,racapowski,"[2, 9]","A loathsome claim, of course, but can you argue that ""Cloverfield""'s premise is anything but?  The Empire State Building collapses floor upon floor, pancake-flat, while a cloud of debris billows from the urban canyons; a rain of office papers falls upon the survivors staggering about, their hair plastered with ash.  Brand me a stiff, but I avoided ""Cloverfield"" for a long time due to moral objections.  Curiosity eventually got the better of me  -  but served only to reinforce my original opinion.The 9/11 imagery is not only tasteless but ensures that the movie never works.  We see all this real-world imagery, all this terror with which we're familiar, and then we see that it's being caused by...a giant lizard-thing.  It's as if we were expected to take seriously the latest Al-Qaeda taped video threat were it recorded by Popeye.  The dissonance never heals; I could never suspend my disbelief, and this is from a woman who sat by happily while Jeff Goldblum once disabled an alien fleet with a mid-'90's PowerBook.  The scenario's not scary when it's wrought by something that can't possibly exist because we've already seen it happen from something that does.The other elements of the film fail to mitigate this.  Of the characters, only Marlena is sympathetic and sensible and dares actually to do stuff despite the perceived handicap of two X chromosomes; the rest of the cast consists of spoiled prissies waiting for the men to rescue them or dudebros, both types badly acted all around.  The camerawork, particularly in the first half, is often poor  -  and, yes, I know it's a cinema v&eacute;rit&eacute; shakycam effort.  Compare it, though, to ""Blair Witch"" or ""REC,"" which were convincingly on-the-spot amateur yet allowed us to see what the filmmakers needed us to see; in ""Cloverfield,"" it's often just plain impossible to make out ongoing events.  (Plot necessity, though, makes the camerawork unbelievably, ridiculously perfect in certain scenes near the end.)The film does get better when it kicks the 9/11 stuff  -  see the effectively creepy subway scenes  -  but it never develops into anything worthy of the imagery it invokes.

On the night of the party, a monster attacks and terrorizes the city, and 5 people must fight to stay alive. The movie was taken from the point of Hud and the video camera, and this film is done in the very interesting style of filming an account of the attack.This movie was amazing. Fantastic acting, straight and to-the-point action, wastes no time on character development, and has one of the most chilling apocalyptic endings since The Birds. The ending is rather left open, and that's a good thing, because I'd rather that type of ending than an ending where the monster dies and people celebrate like nothing ever happened.Another thing I like was how there were NO cliches- there is no scene where the scientist steps into the frame and delivers a boring, 5 minute Shakespearian monologue about the origin of the Monster. You don't know where the monster came from... and that's a good thing.So overall, in the time of cliche'd and stupid movies like Sex And The City, Shutter, Meet The Spartans, and 27 Dresses, we get a very tight and fast paced film that is very No-BS, has your heart racing, your adrenaline pumping, and your blood rushing. Overall, a very profound movie. And please kick yourself in the nuts if you didn't see this in the theater. I saw it in the theater on opening day and loved it. I own it on DVD. That very day I saw it, I was on the edge of my seat and felt like I was on a nonstop rollercoaster.",5,"""OMG This movie sucks because the camera is too shaky""...

That said, my sister, who attended with me, absolutely hated it. I just couldn't understand how we could have such extremely opposite reactions, but now that time has passed, I realize that this is just one of those movies that people either love or hate. There is very little middle ground (as reflected in the reviews).The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that sometimes the 'cameraman' is obviously doing things that are for an interesting shot instead of how an actual person would act. This is supposed to be 'found footage,' and shots like that really draw you out of the experience. The most obvious example of this is when our heroes are making their way across the roof of a building that has semi-collapsed into another building. In a real situation like that, either the camera would be off, or the person holding it would be occasionally using that hand to grab hold and steady himself, resulting in random shots of the roof, his feet, his stomach, etc. Instead, we are treated to a nice, bird's eye view of the monster rampaging in the distance, with just a few shaky movements to indicate that this is all happening on a hand-held camera.Moments like these are few and far between though, so it isn't difficult to recommend this movie to all of my friends.",4,Fans Divided,1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,1362,"['Personally', 'loved', 'movie', 'watched', 'opening', 'weekend', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'said', 'sister', 'who', 'attended', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'such', 'extremely', 'opposite', 'reactions', 'now', 'time', 'passed', 'realize', 'just', 'one', 'movies', 'people', 'love', 'hate', 'very', 'little', 'middle', 'ground', 'reflected', 'reviews', '.The', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'sometimes', ""'cameraman"", 'obviously', 'doing', 'things', 'are', 'interesting', 'shot', 'instead', 'how', 'actual', 'person', 'would', 'act', 'supposed', 'be', ""'found"", 'footage', 'shots', 'really', 'draw', 'experience', 'most', 'obvious', 'example', 'when', 'heroes', 'are', 'making', 'way', 'roof', 'building', 'semi-collapsed', 'building', 'real', 'situation', 'either', 'camera', 'would', 'be', 'off', 'person', 'holding', 'would', 'be', 'occasionally', 'using', 'hand', 'grab', 'hold', 'steady', 'resulting', 'random', 'shots', 'roof', 'feet', 'stomach', 'etc', 'Instead', 'are', 'treated', 'nice', 'bird', 'eye', 'view', 'monster', 'rampaging', 'distance', 'just', 'few', 'shaky', 'movements', 'indicate', 'happening', 'hand-held', 'camera.Moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', ""n't"", 'difficult', 'recommend', 'movie', 'friends']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

I walked out of the theater amid a sea of voices muttering things like ""wow. what did we just watch?""  This is film history.  In a time when everything coming from Hollywood is just a rehash of something else Hollywood gave us years ago, Cloverfield is the birth of something truly unique.The true genius of the film is in its synergy of iconic elements from the history of handheld video cameras, as well as a few what-ifs, imagining how something might have looked if it had been seen by a camera.

The short story line is during a party a man has an argument with his girlfriend who goes back to her apartment when after a while the monster attacks and when the boyfriend gets a call from his girl for help he does indeed try to rescue her.  The problem with rescuing the girlfriend is that her apartment is in the vicinity of the monster's attack zone and the risk to him, his girlfriend, and his three friends with him is great.  Also as you see the mass of people trying to flee Manhattan in a panic the emotion looks so genuine it's pretty incredible.  But I have to say I was more interested in seeing more of the monster than what was happening to the characters themselves and even though it sounds mean I was waiting to see which of them would be killed off by the monster more than if they got away safely.  The monster itself while entertaining to watch just seemed to much of a Godzilla ripoff to take to seriously and instead of seeing a breathe of nuclear fire you instead get these small crablike creatures that far off from the main monster and start attacking people and the soldiers that are attacking the monster.  The blu-ray version does have some more extras but for the picture quality itself there isn't much difference between the blu-ray and the standard dvd version.  Also the audio wasn't much better so if you already have the standard version just stay with that and don't bother with this version.

Legendre,"[2, 7]","By the word ""trend"", I mean that it seems as if the new ""in"" thing to do in Hollywood films is to have a movie with no ending.Just like ""No Country for Old Men"", ""Cloverfield"" starts off with an interesting premise, a great story, heart-stopping action.....and then everything abruptly ends.What's worse, these ""endings"" aren't realy endings at all. Things happen and then they stop happening.>>>POSSIBLE SPOILERS TO FOLLOW&lt;&lt;&lt;There is no plot resolution. We are left with so many questions. What WAS the creature attacking New York City? Where did it come from? Was the military able to defeat it? Did the 2 main protagonists survive? The biggest questions of all was ""What was the friggin' point to all of this?"".One of the biggest gripes seems to have been the shaky camera and nonsensical edits throughout the film which was supposed to give a gritty realism to make the viewer think he or she was watching an amateur video recording of a horrifying event. This type of filming, which has been done before in ""The Blair Witch Project"", really didn't bother me and, to me, DID succeed in giving the film that ""gritty realism"".The special effects are really quite good and the film does succeed in giving the viewer a sense of dread and horror (or at least, nervousness). You really sympathize with the characters and hope they make it through this horror.And that's the biggest problem with ""Cloverfield""; YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY DO OR NOT. Sure, SOME of the main characters HAVE to die. It's inevitable in movies like this, but the MAIN characters fates are unrevealed?What's going on in Hollywood? Just like ""No Country for Old Men"", ""Cloverfield"" seems to think that an interesting premise, good special effects, excellent acting (only applies to ""No Country""), and heart-stopping action is a good enough excuse to make a movie. Nevermind the fact that we should come up with an ending or have a meanigful or at least sensible plot resolution. Let's just film the thing, release a whole lot of hype and media buzz about it, make a zillion, and then laugh at the viewing public as we take their money and give them an incomplete product.I, for one, am getting tired of it. I LOVE movies, but I want a little bang for my buck.

658994,A2VLF9FE68LFX6,B00005JPXY,R. L. Hodges,"[3, 7]","I'm coming to the conclusion that I'm simply expecting way too much out of movies these days.From scene to scene, I excitedly awaited for the movie to FINALLY get going. The extremely lengthy character development ultimately proved to be utterly pointless filler.  Aside from some refreshing special effects and military coverage, all I got were letdowns. With such incredible special effects, particularly the military dealing with the creature (and the creature(s) themselves), I cannot believe how stupid that movie was. That's why I have dubbed it ""The Blair Godzilla Project"" - a bunch of nothing leading up to a nothing ending.  Even worse, this movie can be mercilessly picked apart.  I'll only mention a few things:1. Virtually zero originality in the movie.2.  WAY too much lame character development (utterly useless filler), way too little of why people went to see the movie.3.  Another brainless ""everybody freaks out because nobody's older than 30"" movie.Those are just the minor flaws.  Here's a few to really sink teeth into:Major Hit 1a:  I want to know what brand of video camera that annoying, needing-to-be-punched buffoon was holding. Any camera that can be dropped multiple times, including from about 300 feet (the headless cameraman scene near the end) and still continue to maintain perfect digital clarity at a professional camera level - but affordable enough for 20-somethings to buy them for recording beer bashes - I definitely want one.Major Hit 1b:  ATTENTION HOLLYWOOD:  We're sick of ""jerky camera""!  Put the camera back in the hands of a professional, please.  Or at least recognize the fact that today's kids are experts at using handheld technology such as video cameras.  ""Different"" isn't always progress or good.  Sometimes it sucks.  Watching an entire movie where you're virtually unable to focus your eyes or get a good look at ANYTHING is beyond frustrating.  All that wasted money on effects you never get to see more than a glimpse of is just tragic.  What a loss to the work the special effects team did and what a loss to the audience.Major Hit 2:  Stupid scenes galore. For example, as the military is bombing the creature via B-2 Stealth Bomber, the presumably preoccupied creature (preoccupied with getting bombed) jumps up out of the blast cloud and takes a snap not at the B-2 bomber, but at the harmless camera in the harmless helicopter they're flying in overhead. Yeah, that's remotely plausible and makes sense.  Or the headless cameraman scene - out of an entire city where the creature has been rampaging all night with the US military swarming around it the entire time, the creature just happens to annoyingly and repetitively (and even QUIETLY) pop up on their location and take them by surprise while the military ""loses"" the 300-foot creature long enough for nearly the entire ending of the movie to unfold.Major hit 3:  The greatest failure of the movie was the dropped ball on the smaller spider creatures, which were actually taken straight out of ""Starship Troopers"" with virtually zero alteration to avoid plagiarism (one of my all time favorite movies that begged to have a sequel made and never got one). I got really excited when I saw them, thinking the movie was FINALLY about to get much better. They had a GREAT creep factor, especially the ""bitten girl exploding"" scene. WAY cool. Though the movie overall is extremely unoriginal, there were still some opportunities to really jazz the movie up and get it moving, the spider creatures being the biggest.  But alas, the letdowns continued and the smaller spider creatures simply disappeared for the rest of the movie.  Poof - gone.  Stupid.  One dropped ball after another.Major Hit 4:  That ending. Egad.  My wife and I, huge sci-fi connesseurs, were stunned at the lame ending.  I dont require the good guys to win at the end, but a whole movie full of nothing only to wind up with a nothing ending that was a shamelessly obvious setup for a sequel is downright unacceptable. The end actually left us sitting there looking at each other with our jaws hanging open in disbelief. ""You're kidding!""  I can't see how this movie isn't insulting to any thinking human being. This is where it REALLY turned into the Blair Godzilla Project, same exact ending as Blair Witch. I cannot believe the ZERO-originality factor of this movie compared to how many people are impressed by it.  With movie audiences so easily fooled, I should be working as a writer in Hollywood.  Just by not ripping off other movies, I'd be hailed as the new Speilberg and would be best friends with M. Night Shyamalan.The most aggrivating part for me is bittersweet, so I can't list it as a major hit because it's based on what they got right.  That is, all the filmmaking elements to make this movie absolutely fantastic were there! SO CLOSE to getting it right!  This is hugely frustrating.  The special effects were stunning, the creature itself was fantastic, the realism of the destruction was beautifully done, and even the acting was actually very good (despite my disgust over wimpy/weepy male roles, but I have to remind myself that the movie is about NYC yuppies). And the military scenes were top-notch incredible. EXTREMELY realistic, in fact, something most sci-fi movies totally fail at (like the recent ""War Of The Worlds"", which is downright insulting to anybody in the military that's actually seen combat). What they got right in this movie was stunningly right.  What they got wrong is what's tragic, because it's so overwhelmingly wrong that it ruins the movie.The concept of a Godzilla theme is so overwhelmingly cool that it is regularly re-attempted at least once every decade.  This movie is just the latest attempt.  Huge progress was made, but combined with huge mistakes.  It could have reighned supreme as the mother of all Gozilla movies.  Sadly, it's yet another blown opportunity to get it right and yet another movie to throw into my ""yet another failed Godzilla attempt"" pile.At least this one wasn't a liberalized ""misunderstood homeless pregnant mommy"" Godzilla who just needed to lay her eggs all over NYC.  I would have put the remote through the screen.",2,Blair Godzilla Project,1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,6186,"[""'m"", 'coming', 'conclusion', ""'m"", 'simply', 'expecting', 'way', 'too', 'much',

658995,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00005JPXY,RMurray847,"[3, 6]","It's already a clich&eacute; to call CLOVERFIELD the ""Blair Witch Meets Godzilla"" movie.  But that's about as accurate a snapshot of this film as you could want.  The entire experience is seen through the point of view of one guy who starts out by filming his friend's going-away party and becomes his video of the attack on Manhattan by a Godzilla-like monster.This method accomplished several crucial things:1) It allows the movie's very low budget to get stretched even further and in fact, makes the low budget a non-issue.  Everything looks a little grainy in this film...and if the filmmaker's can't afford to SHOW you something, you can just HEAR it.2) It injects a new life into a tired genre.3) It actually becomes a little poignant, because occasionally the film fast-forwards and we see snippets of the video that was on this particular tape BEFORE this monster video was taped.  These snippets show the early days of the love story between two key characters.  The way CLOVERFIELD is made allows these scenes to be integrated in a completely organic way.4) It creates a ""you are there"" feeling that makes the film work...much in the way this method made BLAIR WITCH work.The story itself is nothing new.  Big monster attacks big city.  Mass destruction ensues.  The military is ineffective.  Many people get squished.  But what creator J.J. Abrams has managed to do is find a new way of telling the story that makes it seem at least a little fresh AND makes it almost real time and quite visceral.  You are ""on the ground"" as events unfold.  Just like the main characters, you get NO information on where this thing came from, what might be happening anywhere else in the city or the world, etc.  The movie doesn't have to answer any questions, because the videographer of the movie wouldn't have gotten any answers either.It's fast-paced, funny at times and absolutely scary at times.  You'll jump more than once and you'll have a good time.  Your brain will be engaged for a minimal amount of time...you see this film at a gut level.  In terms of accomplishing what it set out to do, CLOVERFIELD gets close to knocking it out of the park.There are weaknesses, of course.  The film is very short (less than 90 minutes) and even then, the opening scenes at the party feel like padding.  Yes, we get to meet the characters who become central to the rest of the film...but watching a bunch of strangers partying is about as exciting as it would be to see a home movie of a friend's party.  Also, the actors are mostly unknown, and they aren't the greatest.  No one gives a true stinker of a performance but neither is there much above average.  (The one exception is Lizzy Caplan [best known for MEAN GIRLS], who gives a little depth to her role.)Finally, my biggest problem with the low-budget was that Manhattan wasn't crowded enough.  If something like this happened, the streets would be absolutely choked with people.  But the crowd scenes make it seem as though the city has been mostly abandoned already.  You just have to go with it.So CLOVERFIELD is solid, exciting entertainment.  It won't be a classic, but it does rise above its genre trappings through its inventive setup and a few truly jolting scenes.--Visit my site [...] for more reviews",4,Solid jolts raise it above the standard genre cliches.,1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,3264,"['already', 'clich', 'eacute', 'call', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Meets', 'Godzilla', 'movie', 'about', 'as', 'accurate', 'snapshot', 'film', 'could', 'want', 'entire', 'experience', 'seen', 'point', 'view', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'out', 'filming', 'friend', 'going-away', 'party', 'video', 'attack', 'Manhattan', 'Godzilla-like', 'monster.This', 'method', 'accomplished', 'several', 'crucial', 'things:1', 'movie', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'get', 'stretched', 'even', 'further', 'fact', 'low', 'budget', 'non-issue', 'Everything', 'little', 'grainy', 'film', 'filmmaker', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'SHOW', 'something', 'can', 'just', 'HEAR', 'it.2', 'new', 'life', 'tired', 'genre.3', 'actually', 'little', 'poignant', 'occasionally', 'film', 'fast-forwards', 'see', 'snippets', 'video', 'was', 'particular', 'tape', 'monster', 'video', 'was', 'taped', 'snippets', 'show', 'early', 'days', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'key', 'characters', 'way', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'made', 'scenes', 'be', 'integrated', 'completely', 'organic', 'way.4', 'are', 'there', 'feeling', 'film', 'work', 'much', 'way', 'method', 'made', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'work.The', 'story', 'nothing', 'new', 'Big', 'monster', 'attacks', 'big', 'city', 'Mass', 'destruction', 'ensues', 'military', 'ineffective', 'Many', 'people', 'get', 'squished', 'what', 'creator', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'managed', 'do', 'find', 'new', 'way', 'telling', 'story', 'seem', 'least', 'little', 'fresh', 'AND', 'almost', 'real', 'time', 'quite', 'visceral', 'are', 'ground', 'events', 'unfold', 'Just', 'main', 'characters', 'get', 'information', 'where', 'thing', 'came', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'happening', 'anywhere', 'else', 'city', 'world', 'etc', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'answer', 'questions', 'videographer', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'gotten', 'answers', 'either.It', 'fast-paced', 'funny', 'times', 'absolutely', 'scary', 'times', ""'ll"", 'jump', 'more', 'once', ""'ll"", 'have', 'good', 'time', 'brain', 'will', 'be', 'engaged', 'minimal', 'amount', 'time', 'see', 'film', 'gut', 'level', 'terms', 'accomplishing', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'close', 'knocking', 'park.There', 'are', 'weaknesses', 'course', 'film', 'very', 'short', 'less', '90', 'minutes', 'even', 'then', 'opening', 'scenes', 'party', 'feel', 'padding', 'Yes', 'get', 'meet', 'characters', 'who', 'become', 'central', 'rest', 'film', 'watching', 'bunch', 'strangers', 'partying', 'as', 'exciting', 'would', 'be', 'see', 'home', 'movie', 'friend', 'party', 'Also', 'actors', 'are', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'are', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'one', 'true', 'stinker', 'performance', 'there', 'much', 'average', 'one', 'exception', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', '[', 'best', 'known', 'MEAN', 'GIRLS', ']', 'who', 'little', 'depth', 'role', 'Finally', 'biggest', 'problem', 'low-budget', 'was', 'Manhattan', 'was', ""n't"", 'crowded', 'enough', 'something', 'happened', 'streets', 'would', 'be', 'absolutely', 'choked', 'people', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'make', 'seem', 'city', 'been', 'mostly', 'abandoned', 'already', 'just', 'have', 'go', 'it.So', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'solid', 'exciting', 'entertainment', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'classic', 'rise', 'genre', 'trappings', 'inventive', 'setup', 'few', 'truly', 'jolting', 'scenes.', 'Visit', 'site', '[', ']', 'more', 'reviews']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

658997,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JPXY,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 5]","Cloverfield (Matt Reeves, 2008)The main reason that Cloverfield is so immensely satisfying, besides being the first January-horror-film release in recent memory that's actually good, is that it does exactly what it sets out to do-- entertain. Sure, there may be better movies out now (or, if you don't live in ""limited areas"", will be better movies out in the near future), but Cloverfield isn't trying to be a No Country for Old Men or There Will Be Blood-- it wants to be a fifties monster movie fifty years on, and it does so in great, glorious detail. It's a movie that's short (eighty-four minutes), sweet, and, after an overly long piece of setup, to the point. It wants to make you laugh, it wants to make you jump, and in a few scenes it wants to make you cringe, and it accomplishes all of these things without any deep, reflective moments or other stuff that so often seems out of place in a horror film. (Think about, since the comparisons are coming thick and fast, Heather's monologue on the rock five or ten minutes into The Blair Witch Project. None of that sort of malarkey here.) In some ways, there's a better comparison to be made to, say, ""The Most Dangerous Game"" than to The Blair Witch Project here.The secondary reason that Cloverfield is so immensely satisfying is that TV director Matt Reeves got around the need to figure out how to make the small screen-big screen transition by taking a relatively original idea-- having the entire film told from the perspective of a video camera (and yes, it is the entire film, going The Blair Witch Project three or four better)-- and filtering his story through it. When your whole movie comes through the lens of a handheld video camera, you can pretty much blow off all the differences between small-screen and big-screen directing. This is normally the place in the review where I'd start complaining about the technical details. You're not going to get any of that here; the handheld-video-camera angle throws them all away. I will file something like a reverse complaint, however; the sound mix in this movie, which is one of the reasons you must go see it on the big screen, is way too good for a handheld production. Reeves may have nabbed his video ideas from The Blair Witch Project, but the sound mix is straight outta Doom3, and it's awesome. The other big point in the handheld-video-camera approach's favor is that there is no third-person-omniscient here, so all we know is what the characters know. I've heard at least two reviewers complaining about this. I don't understand why, because usually we're all complaining about the exact opposite. We only know what they know, and that's the reason this film is so effective; while, yeah, there is one big-reveal scene towards the end, I'm willing to forgive it given that the big-reveal scene in most monster movies since the special effects budget started outstripping the promotional budget in Hollywood monster movies is ""the last half of the movie"". We actually see very little of the nemeses in this movie, and that's one of the big, big points in its favor, for reasons I'll get into a much greater detail below. Besides, the structure forces Reeves to focus on the idea that a monster movie should be about the humans, rather than the monsters. It's a beautiful sight to see.The tertiary reason-- reasons, I should say-- Cloverfield is so immensely satisfying is that despite my assertion at the beginning of this review that the film's entire goal is to entertain, there's so very, very much more going on under the surface here. The trick is that you don't need to consciously grasp any of this stuff to enjoy the flick; you can just look at it as a monster movie and it will still be fun. The rest is just gravy. In this case, the first thing to address is the obvious comparison everyone's making (and interpreting differently)-- what's the movie saying about the Most Overrated Event in Human History(TM)? I'm going to offer a perspective I haven't seen yet, and one I hope is more welcome than the others-- that the ability of a filmmaker to destroy New York City in a movie, and the ability of movie fans to enjoy watching New York City be destroyed, is a sign that we're all starting to get over the obsession and get on with our lives. After all, monsters have been destroying cities in movies for decades, and movie fans have been loving it. The second one that really struck me was that Reeves took a relatively unknown stable of (mostly) TV character actors and made them into serious star material; the characters' actions and reactions here never feel fake or forced. The third is that there's a confusion factor here that there shouldn't be, given that we're supposedly seeing objective evidence captured on a video camera. Some will use (and, no doubt, some have used) this to trash the movie; I see it as something entirely different. As I said before, we know only what the characters do; there are very few points, however, where the characters aren't questioning the evidence of their own senses. Why shouldn't the viewer, as well? A lot of the things that don't quite add up are stuff you wouldn't really think about much consciously (like, how big is the main bad guy, anyway?), and they're anchored by a relatively solid grounding-- the geography of midtown Manhattan, which is concrete and unassailable. Now, I'm not entirely sure, since I'm not Matt Reeves or scriptwriter Drew Goddard, but I think this was intentional, and it's great.In short, the first major film event of 2008 turns out to be a monster movie.

If they aren't doing battle with space aliens, a bio-engineered plague, or a global warming-inspired ice age, they're fending off some nondescript creature that's come out of nowhere to lay waste to large sections of Lower and Midtown Manhattan.  And, indeed, after ""War of the Worlds,"" ""I Am Legend,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" and now ""Cloverfield,"" one begins to wonder just how much abuse one little island should be expected to take before finally crying uncle.Blending the content of ""Godzilla"" with the style of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" the makers of ""Cloverfield"" relate their story entirely through the use of a handheld camera, as a group of twenty-something friends have their cocktail party rudely interrupted by the sudden appearance of a monster capable of tipping over skyscrapers and squashing cars as if they were bugs.  The movie follows a remnant of partygoers as they wend their way through the smoky chaos of the ruined city, with one of them recording the horrors and devastation on a camcorder as he goes.Despite having a relatively low budget for a film of this type, ""Cloverfield"" does a remarkable job in blending CGI graphics with home video technology.  It may be true that the inky blackness of the nighttime setting helps to cover a multitude of special effects sins (some viewers may be frustrated by the murky indistinctiveness of the monster itself), but, on the whole, director Matt Reeves, cinematographer Michael Bonvillain, editor Kevin Stitt, and a team of highly talented FX and production artists are to be commended for achieving so much with so little.The advantage of the you-are-there approach that the filmmakers have adopted is that it makes the audience feel more a part of the actual event than if the story were given a slicker, more conventional presentation.  Suffice it to say there's no Will Smith here slapping on a flight suit and zooming off into the wild blue yonder to duke it out mano-a-mano with the creature and singlehandedly save the world.  These are ordinary, average people caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and it`s no coincidence that much of the imagery is clearly intended to evoke memories of 9/11.  After all, a world where post-apocalyptic paranoia runs rampant is no place for conventional action heroes.  Therefore, the verisimilitude of the piece is greatly enhanced by the use of relatively unknown players in the key roles (Michael Stahl-David, Jessica Lucas, T.J. Miller, Lizzy Caplan, Odette Yustman, Mike Vogel).The disadvantage of this 1st person-restricted approach is that it occasionally leads to repetitiveness in the storytelling, with even the gimmick itself threatening to wear out its welcome quicker than the monster himself does.  The narrow focus is also liable to drive some viewers crazy by not providing any kind of resolution or explanation to neatly wrap things up at the end (to me, this is a strength rather than a weakness).Finally, theatergoers who were rendered nauseated by the nonstop bobbing-and-weaving camerawork on the big screen should know that the effect is much less vomit-inducing when viewed on TV.The characters and their relationships may be no more than mere window dressing placed at the service of the story, but that really doesn't matter, for in the case of ""Cloverfield,"" the filmmaking itself is the star.",3,stunning visuals overcome narrative weaknesses,1210377600,"05 10, 2008",2008,3406,"['***1/2You', 'sure', 'got', 'ta', 'give', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'props', 'resilience', 'are', ""n't"", 'doing', 'battle', 'space', 'aliens', 'bio-engineered', 'plague', 'global', 'warming-inspired', 'ice', 'age', ""'re"", 'fending', 'off', 'nondescript', 'creature', 'come', 'nowhere', 'lay', 'waste', 'large', 'sections', 'Lower', 'Midtown', 'Manhattan', 'indeed', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Am', 'Legend', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'now', 'Cloverfield', 'one', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'one', 'little', 'island', 'should', 'be', 'expected', 'take', 'finally', 'crying', 'uncle.Blending', 'content', 'Godzilla', 'style', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'makers', 'Cloverfield', 'relate', 'story', 'entirely', 'use', 'handheld', 'camera', 'group', 'twenty-something', 'friends', 'have', 'cocktail', 'party', 'rudely', 'interrupted', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'monster', 'capable', 'tipping', 'skyscrapers', 'squashing', 'cars', 'were', 'bugs', 'movie', 'remnant', 'partygoers', 'wend', 'way', 'smoky', 'chaos', 'ruined', 'city', 'one', 'recording', 'horrors', 'devastation', 'camcorder', 'having', 'relatively', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'type', 'Cloverfield', 'remarkable', 'job', 'blending', 'CGI', 'graphics', 'home', 'video', 'technology', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'inky', 'blackness', 'nighttime', 'setting', 'cover', 'multitude', 'special', 'effects', 'sins', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'frustrated', 'murky', 'indistinctiveness', 'monster', 'whole', 'director', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'cinematographer', 'Michael', 'Bonvillain', 'editor', 'Kevin', 'Stitt', 'team', 'highly', 'talented', 'FX', 'production', 'artists', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'achieving', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'little.The', 'advantage', 'you-are-there', 'approach', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'adopted', 'audience', 'feel', 'more', 'part', 'actual', 'event', 'story', 'were', 'given', 'slicker', 'more', 'conventional', 'presentation', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Will', 'Smith', 'here', 'slapping', 'flight', 'suit', 'zooming', 'off', 'wild', 'blue', 'yonder', 'duke', 'out', 'mano-a-mano', 'creature', 'singlehandedly', 'save', 'world', 'are', 'ordinary', 'average', 'people', 'caught', 'up', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 's', 'coincidence', 'much', 'imagery', 'clearly', 'intended', 'evoke', 'memories', '9/11', 'world', 'where', 'post-apocalyptic', 'paranoia', 'runs', 'rampant', 'place', 'conventional', 'action', 'heroes', 'Therefore', 'verisimilitude', 'piece', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'use', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'players', 'key', 'roles', 'Michael', 'Stahl-David', 'Jessica', 'Lucas', 'T.J.', 'Miller', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'Odette', 'Yustman', 'Mike', 'Vogel', '.The', 'disadvantage', '1st', 'person-restricted', 'approach', 'occasionally', 'repetitiveness', 'storytelling', 'even', 'gimmick', 'threatening', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'quicker', 'monster', 'narrow', 'focus', 'also', 'liable', 'drive', 'viewers', 'crazy', 'not', 'providing', 'kind', 'resolution', 'explanation', 'neatly', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'end', 'strength', 'rather', 'weakness', '.Finally', 'theatergoers', 'who', 'were', 'rendered', 'nauseated', 'nonstop', 'bobbing-and-weaving', 'camerawork', 'big', 'screen', 'should', 'know', 'effect', 'much', 'less', 'vomit-inducing', 'when', 'viewed', 'TV.The', 'characters', 'relationships', 'may', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'mere', 'window', 'dressing', 'placed', 'service', 'story', 'really', ""n't"", 'matter', 'case', 'Cloverfield', 'filmmaking', 'star']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

But ""Blair Witch"" is a subtle masterpiece of steadily mounting terror.  You have the time to get to know the characters and see how their awful fates are ingeniously worked out.  By contrast, ""Cloverfield"" overwhelms you with its visuals and special effects, but the experience proves to be exhausting and emotionally remote.  Because so much happens so fast the filmmakers apparently decided that such niceties as character development and psychological and even physical probability weren't really necessary.  Even given the context of a 300-foot monster smashing Manhattan, I found the characters' actions in rescuing a damsel in distress to be highly unlikely.  And who are these kids, anyway?  Some reviewers said that they were so obnoxious by the end of the movie the reviewers were rooting for the monster to eat all of them.  I wouldn't go that far.

But, as it plays out, it is not very appealing to watch.  And not just because it's shaky, but because there really is no written story.  It plays out as if it's just something that got captured on an amateur video recorder.  It has us sit through about nearly 20 minutes of  a casual party scene in someone's apartment which is boring as hell even for only 20 minutes.  Finally, the element of shock kicks in and the non-reality finally comes into play. Suddenly, there are monsters in the street and everyone is scared for their lives.  Even the guy with the camcorder seems to think it's more important to keep the video camera running, than to save his own butt which would represent more of a reality in its truest sense.And just like ""The Blair Witch Project"", a raw looking camcorder based film is sickening to watch on the big screen.  And when it's all over, who would want to watch it again?  Once the ""shock factor"" has passed, the film can no longer be interesting, if it was at all.  You're not going to be shocked again so that one thrill that was there will be lost forevermore.Like I said, the whole concept sounds interesting, but the end result is  nothing great as you watch it.",2,This should have just gone to DVD.

So obviously, Cloverfield was barking up the right tree with this reviewer.Cloverfield is a difficult movie to figure out. At times, this movie truly entrenches you into a new realm of science fiction monster movies. Cloverfield's style is what Roland Emmerich's Godzilla should have been. Told in a War of the World's fashion, the story is told from the perspective of a bunch of average Joes. No marine biologist or ""worm guys"" in Cloverfield, they react more than often in the exact same ways that the audience would. Michael Stahl - David outshines the rest of the group and actually saves the movie from clich&eacute; bad acting. Another important element of the film was a use of a nearly invisible script. The actors do, for the most part, seem really be reacting to all of these events.No science fiction movie is going to be a success without a great monster. This beast is visually stunning and very refreshing in a genre that is most of the time by the book. Without revealing too much, there are also little creatures that play a huge role within the movie as well. Much like Jaws, the movie relies a lot of quick appearances and over powering dominance on the NYC. Too many monster movies depend on showing the monster non stop to show its monstrosity, but inherently, the more a monster is shown, the more flaws that are revealed. Describing what the monster looks like would only be an injustice to the reader. As a monster fan, I would not do that to you.The difficulty within the movie is the fact that darn handheld camera is both the movie's greatest accomplishment and greatest crutch. Its style really helps you connect with some of the characters and feel stuck with the group. The hand held camera also allows the monster and its critters to be more threatening because of their lack of detail. Like any movie that is based on hand held camera use, the style wears out its welcome very early in the movie. About 45 minutes in, motion sickness medicine doesn't sound like such a bad idea. Another problem with the hand held camera is who is holding the camera. T.J. Miller's ""Hud"" had to be one of the most annoying characters to give such a prominent role. His efforts of comic relief are both unrealistic and worst of all not very funny. I was cheering for him to be killed the entire movie.Overall, I would say the good outweighs the bad with a great monster and great effects. I would rank it as just as good or better than last year's sleeper, The Host. J.J. Abrams said in an interview that he was visiting Japan with his son and stopped by a toy store, and they were bombarded with Godzilla toys. J.J. decided America needed it's own monster. Unlike the cuddly King Kong, J.J. wanted to create something unrelenting and very insane. I would say for the most part that he succeeded.",4,You always fear what you don't understand,1200614400,"01 18, 2008",2008,2912,"['start', 'review', 'feel', 'pertinent', 'know', 'grew', 'up', 'Godzilla', 'fanatic', 'So', 'obviously', 'Cloverfield', 'was', 'barking', 'up', 'right', 'tree', 'reviewer.Cloverfield', 'difficult', 'movie', 'figure', 'out', 'times', 'movie', 'truly', 'new', 'realm', 'science', 'fiction', 'monster', 'movies', 'Cloverfield', 'style', 'what', 'Roland', 'Emmerich', 'Godzilla', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Told', 'War', 'World', 'fashion', 'story', 'told', 'perspective', 'bunch', 'average', 'Joes', 'marine', 'biologist', 'worm', 'guys', 'Cloverfield', 'react', 'more', 'often', 'exact', 'same', 'ways', 'audience', 'would', 'Michael', 'Stahl', 'David', 'rest', 'group', 'actually', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'bad', 'acting', 'important', 'element', 'film', 'was', 'use', 'nearly', 'invisible', 'script', 'actors', 'do', 'most', 'part', 'seem', 'really', 'be', 'reacting', 'events.No', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'success', 'great', 'monster', 'beast', 'visually', 'stunning', 'very', 'refreshing', 'genre', 'most', 'time', 'book', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'also', 'little', 'creatures', 'play', 'huge', 'role', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'Much', 'Jaws', 'movie', 'lot', 'quick', 'appearances', 'powering', 'dominance', 'NYC', 'Too', 'many', 'monster', 'movies', 'depend', 'showing', 'monster', 'non', 'stop', 'show', 'monstrosity', 'inherently', 'more', 'monster', 'shown', 'more', 'flaws', 'are', 'revealed', 'Describing', 'what', 'monster', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'injustice', 'reader', 'monster', 'fan', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'you.The', 'difficulty', 'movie', 'fact', 'darn', 'handheld', 'camera', 'movie', 'greatest', 'accomplishment', 'greatest', 'crutch', 'style', 'really', 'connect', 'characters', 'feel', 'stuck', 'group', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'also', 'monster', 'critters', 'be', 'more', 'threatening', 'lack', 'detail', 'movie', 'based', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'use', 'style', 'out', 'welcome', 'very', 'early', 'movie', '45', 'minutes', 'motion', 'sickness', 'medicine', ""n't"", 'sound', 'bad', 'idea', 'problem', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'who', 'holding', 'camera', 'T.J.', 'Miller', 'Hud', 'had', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'annoying', 'characters', 'give', 'such', 'prominent', 'role', 'efforts', 'comic', 'relief', 'are', 'unrealistic', 'worst', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'was', 'cheering', 'be', 'killed', 'entire', 'movie.Overall', 'would', 'say', 'good', 'bad', 'great', 'monster', 'great', 'effects', 'would', 'rank', 'as', 'just', 'good', 'better', 'last', 'year', 'sleeper', 'Host', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'said', 'interview', 'was', 'visiting', 'Japan', 'son', 'stopped', 'toy', 'store', 'were', 'bombarded', 'Godzilla', 'toys', 'J.J.', 'decided', 'America', 'needed', 'own', 'monster', 'cuddly', 'King', 'Kong', 'J.J.', 'wanted', 'create', 'something', 'unrelenting', 'very', 'insane', 'would', 'say', 'most', 'part', 'succeeded']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

But it's more than that.We are warned that this is video is property of the Department of Defense and is a recording found in a place formerly known as Central Park.  The story unfolds:Robert Hawkins, Beth and his friends are video'ing the going away party and suddenly a large crash is heard.  They run out and find that the city around them is coming apart!  No one knows what's happening or going on and somehow, their social veneer comes apart.A clumsy love story ensues partway through the film; we get somewhat enamored by the silly nerd who's running the camera so that ""people know"" what happened.It's like an American Godzilla!Yeah, on the surface, but what was Abrams trying to do with this film?I think the director Matt Reeves is making a statement about the quick YouTube like generation.  Hey, let's get this on video and upload it to YouTube wow, gee!  Can't tell if that is a criticism of this generation's propensity for the internet or the lack of social skills presented.  The constant documentary style of the handy video cam and cell phone camera is more than a subtle commentary.The plot rolls along nicely.  Little creatures peel of the main monster and make their home in the sewers of New York.  When they bite, somehow the victim eventually explodes.  This is never adequately explained, but the horror of losing your friend to this is not pretty -- a splatter on the tarmac is all you get!The tension of the film surrounds not only saving Beth (the girl with a rebar impalement problem) but these kids are caught between the monster and the military, barely escaping with their lives.  And then not even that!I understand the DVD has deleted scenes, a ""making of"" and a commentary by the director.The criticism of the shaky camera and the Blair Witch Project is a minor annoyance.  What are the director and producer doing?  What are they trying to say?  This was a bold experiment by Abrams.  Yes, could' a been done better, but not a bad first effort.  Where's the sequel??There is no film score, which makes sense since this is a civilian video.

Movies are defined by how they reference other movies - that's how they get sold in today's bottom-line driven, play-it-safe Hollywood culture.""Cloverfield"" was easily pitched as ""It's 'Blair Witch' meets 'Godzilla' meets 'Aliens' meets 'Friends,' with a paean to 9/11 thrown in.""  Adopting the same fiction of ""BW"" - that we've found the videotape capturing horrific yet mostly unseen events happening to real people - ""Cloverfield"" tells the thankfully-terrifying tale of a gargantuan monster tearing apart Manhattan.Unfortunately, while we cared about Heather, Josh and Mike to some degree in ""BW,"" we really can't muster up any empathy for the cadre of uber-hip twenty-somethings ""Cloverfield"" throws us into.  These are obviously people who dress according to magazine covers and have memorized the cliched roles from ""Friends.""  There's a Ross-Rachel love story going on involving two leads, while the guy's brother and best friend throw him a going-away party that the best friend videotapes.  This follows the tired cliche of everyone on the tape talking about the lovers' ""secret undying love for each other.""  The guy is even going to Japan, for God's sake, just like Ross did in a plot contrivance to keep the Ross-Rachel story ""interesting"" for another bloated season.This tripe occupies the first fifteen minutes, and then thankfully the monster shows up.  The movie's handling of the monster is its greatest strength, as the monster is shown in terrifying glimpses and quick shots.  This thing is a behemoth, destroying the Brooklyn Bridge with an accidental swipe of its tail.  Perhaps more terrifying, it drops space-lice from its skin that are miniature demons straight out of ""Starship Troopers"" crossed with the baddies from ""Aliens.""  This is scary stuff.The story follows our intrepid band of twits as they try to first escape Manhattan and then to save the girlfriend, Beth.  Manhattan is destroyed, convincingly, by both the monster and the U.S. Army.  The movie never really explains what's going on, and this leads to several truly terrifying and shocking moments I won't spoil here.  But this part of the movie is what ""Godzilla"" should have been.Unfortunately, the videotape of the carnage is recorded over the lovers' tryst, so we get perfectly-timed snippets of their relationship-bliss intercut with the action.  If we cared about these two, I suppose it would rise to powerful stuff a la ""Titanic,"" but since we don't, the love story is an annoying distraction.Much has been made of the jerky handicam style of the movie.  I saw it on DVD, so the TV screen was probably more merciful than a full size movie screen.

The acting was decent and as already mentioned the special effects were well done.Bad points:The opening party sequence went on too long. All it was trying to tell us was that a couple had split up and that could have been done much quicker. After 10 minutes had gone by, in what is a short movie, I was beginning to wonder if I was watching the right film...I accept that you have to suspend disbelief when watching films like this, but this had so many occasions when what happened lacked any credibility in reality (I'm talking about the Helicopter crash and the girl who was impaled on the steel pole to name two examples). I also got fed up with hearing people saying ""oh my God"" every 30 seconds. The hand-held camera use needed to be broken up. 84 mins was too long for a wobbly picture....Having said all that it is worth seeing, as after the slow start its certainly an entertaining rollercoaster ride.

And indeed, Godzilla was the inspiration for Cloverfield according to comments in the Special Features of the DVD by Producer JJ Abrams (also producer of the TV seriesLost,AliasandFelicity).Cloverfield succeeds as a cool monster movie, but the shake, rattle and roll of the handheld camera in which the entire movie is viewed make for a miserable viewing experience. Sure, it adds an element of realism, but it is the most memorable part of the movie. In other words, the annoying handheld camera work is so distracting that it takes away from the story that is trying to break through all the jiggling.The acting is TV actor caliber (no surprise: the movie's chock full of TV actors and it has a TV director), but works pretty well from the perspective that the movie is being told (at least the acting was better than in a Godzilla movie!!!). Cloverfield almost seems like an episode of ""Felicity in the City Meets the Monster."" This is not to say that I still was not highly entertained.A sequel to Cloverfield has been announced for a potential 2009 release.

No context, no explanations, just sudden catastrophe and confusion, filmed by someone clumsy. On that level, it was extremely well presented. Great special effects. Great audio. Everything from the flickering of the lights to the background noises, was timed to be eerie, disturbing or intensely interesting. You don't look away.So why didn't it work better?Part of the problem is that the movie is so derivative. It feels too much like a cash-in on 9/11, and it feels too much like a gigantic homage to Alien. Somehow you feel like you've seen all this before. It's Godzilla, done bigger and better for the sake of bigger and better. Aliens, but scaled up.Part of the problem is, as well as the actors conveyed terror, fear, bravery and foolishness, at no time did it feel authentic - and they tried so very, very hard to be real. I think it was more the storyline's fault than the acting. The characters just don't engage, even though the script was filled with events and points that just begged you to care about them. Somehow, the plot just tried too hard to make you care. But I was rooting for the monster the whole way.If you can find it cheap and really want to see a believable enactment of disaster response and chaos, this is a good choice.

Because the entire premise hinges on the style in which it was shot - a style that wrecks havoc with my motion-sickness.  I spent only half the movie really watching the screen, and had to rewind to see the interesting bits, and still ended up with a nagging headache and an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach.  And the crushingly disappointing thing is that I really liked the premise of the movie!  There wasn't a huge amount of gore, the fact that there were mere glimpses of the monster was well-done in a very old-fashioned (and in my opinion, far better) way, and the rather open ending was, although predictable from the opening credits, still the best possible wrap-up to the story.The acting could have been better.  It seemed a little flat and unbelievable at points, and a few of the characters grated on my nerves.  And, of course, the entire movie was completely unbelievable.  I can't say much specifically without giving away the plot (and I dislike it when people do that!) but I will say the resistance to weapons by the monster and the words and actions of the military personnel didn't ring at all true.

There won't be much middle ground. (ex. I loved it, and my wife hated it) Something you SHOULD know before watching this movie, is that it is shot entirely from a handheld video camera. Entirely. That means there is alot of moving and shaking and bouncing all around. (think Blair Witch Project, but in NYC) I personally liked the personal frame of reference. I guess it just made it feel more real, and me feel less detached from it. The dialogue in some of the scenes didn't quite fit. Characters cracking jokes at times, and in situations, where they obviously wouldn't. There is no bow on this one tying everything together folks. The end is just the end.

When their city was under attack by this monster, the people of New York did EVERYTHING wrong!!When buildings were coming down and the head from the Statue of Liberty was flung thousands of yards (crushing somebody's car upon impact) people SHOULD have started running, but instead they stood in the street and talked about it and took pictures with their cell phones.  Do these people have no self preservation insinct at all?Next we see the looting going on.  People stealing CD players, speakers and other consumer electronics.  I'm sorry, but if your city is under attack and your life is in danger and you're going to make time for looting, STEAL A HANDGUN OR A SHOTGUN AND SOME AMMO!!  Survival is more important than audio or video equipment!!Also, when they bomb the monster, WHY did they send in a B2 Stealth Bomber?  The U.S. Airforce has other bombers that would have been much better suited for the job.  The B2 is slow, maneuvers poorly and has a history of navigational problems.  The ONLY advantage to the B2 Stealth bomber is that it's stealth technology means that it can evade detection on certain types of radar.Did the U.S. military REALLY believe that this monster was tracking our aircraft with some sort of radar?And when the evac helicopter tries to fly the civilians to safety shouldn't it have flown AWAY from the monster, rather than heading towards and directly OVER IT?  Doesn't that fly right in the face of good sense?  Sure, it LOOKED more dramatic that way, but flying over a 10-story monster that's being hit with artillery is a good way to get killed.

659035,A3J3AKELO8I207,B00005JPXY,"Stephen C. Jordan ""virginia reader""","[1, 2]","Okay -- everyone has talked about the shaky camera work, the monster movie aspect, the limited backstory and exposition, and that it might not be the most horrific horror movie ever, but I think that these commentaries miss the point.  What ultimately makes a movie work (or not), is whether we care about the characters, and Cloverfield succeeds because we root for Rob (played by Michael Stahl-David) to save and reunite with Beth (Odette Yustman), and Marlena (Lizzy Caplan) and Hud (T.J. Rogers) provide enough wit, sarcasm, humor and reality to keep us grounded and  involved.  The conceit of the single camcorder gives the movie a reality Youtube feel that heightens the illusion that these are real people, not just actors.The story in a nutshell is that a video has been recovered that shows what happens the night a horrific monster attacks New York.  It was supposed to be a testimonial tape for Rob as he prepares to go to Japan, and it was shot over a tape he made of a magical day he spent with Beth.  This way we get some of Rob and Beth's backstory at strategic intervals, we get introduced to the characters, and the horror story that unfolds is an accident of time and fate.It feels like the moviemakers -- JJ Abrams produced it, Matt Rees directed --must have felt that the 1998 remake of Godzilla was a missed opportunity, because this feels like an extended commentary on that film.  Like that movie, we don't see the monster fully for most of the film.  Unlike that film, this story is not about the military, scientists, etc. trying to fight the monster (though they are certainly present), but how ordinary people might experience the night.  As such it is much more successful.The jittery style may be tough to take at moments, but this is a film definitely worth seeing, and I think it will stick with you a little longer than the average horror movie because of the relationships at its heart.",4,A Sweet Tragedy Underneath the Horror and Gimmick,1252281600,"09 7, 2009",2009,1919,"['Okay', 'everyone', 'talked', 'shaky', 'camera', 'work', 'monster', 'movie', 'aspect', 'limited', 'backstory', 'exposition', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'most', 'horrific', 'horror', 'movie', 'ever', 'think', 'commentaries', 'miss', 'point', 'What', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'work', 'not', 'care', 'characters', 'Cloverfield', 'root', 'Rob', 'played', 'Michael', 'Stahl-David', 'save', 'reunite', 'Beth', 'Odette', 'Yustman', 'Marlena', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'Hud', 'T.J.', 'Rogers', 'provide', 'enough', 'wit', 'sarcasm', 'humor', 'reality', 'keep', 'grounded', 'involved', 'conceit', 'single', 'camcorder', 'movie', 'reality', 'Youtube', 'feel', 'illusion', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'actors.The', 'story', 'nutshell', 'video', 'been', 'recovered', 'what', 'night', 'horrific', 'monster', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'testimonial', 'tape', 'Rob', 'go', 'Japan', 'was', 'shot', 'tape', 'made', 'magical', 'day', 'spent', 'Beth', 'way', 'get', 'Rob', 'Beth', 'backstory', 'strategic', 'intervals', 'get', 'introduced', 'characters', 'horror', 'story', 'accident', 'time', 'fate.It', 'feels', 'moviemakers', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'produced', 'Matt', 'Rees', 'directed', 'must', 'have', 'felt', '1998', 'remake', 'Godzilla', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'feels', 'extended', 'commentary', 'film', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'monster', 'fully', 'most', 'film', 'film', 'story', 'not', 'military', 'scientists', 'etc', 'trying', 'fight', 'monster', 'are', 'certainly', 'present', 'how', 'ordinary', 'people', 'might', 'experience', 'night', 'such', 'much', 'more', 'successful.The', 'jittery', 'style', 'may', 'be', 'tough', 'take', 'moments', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'think', 'will', 'stick', 'little', 'longer', 'average', 'horror', 'movie', 'relationships', 'heart']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

659040,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00005JPXY,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[140, 295]","I know it can be a clever gimmick to have someone document a crisis on his videocamera, but every single shot doesn't have to be in an earthquake!The plot, in short order, is nothing more than a group of young folks gathered together in a Manhattan apartment to say good-bye to a close friend who is being promoted to a position in his company that will require him to move to Japan.  There is the usual angst about who is sleeping with who accompanied by one stereotype after another paraded out in dull fashion (the funny side-kick, the cool-headed one, the courageous hero, blah, blah, blah).Things serious change from the happy (but underlyingly moody party) to chaos when a sudden explosion and blackout hits New York City.  What follows are some truly outstanding special effects that really look like a rampaging monster is tearing apart Manhattan and caught on video by an average Joe (actually, by the funny but hugely insensitive Hud).  He documents their journey to find his friend's girlfriend in a broken down apartment building and their attempts to get out of the city alive or at least leave behind a videotape for others to see.Okay, now for what worked and what didn't, and for that I will go to my newest and admittedly easiest format of reviewing, my ""Hits"" and ""Misses"":The Hits:(1) The film sincerely and creatively looks like a real recording of a disaster as it happens.  Much credit goes to the special effects team.  Keep in mind that I am strictly talking about the LOOK of the film as being realistic and NOT the storyline or dialogue, hence, my praise to the special effects team.(2) A series of very memorable moments: (A) The Statue of Liberty's head bouncing down the streets of New York  (B) The subway journey  (C) The Helicopter ride(3) Some (and I mean just some) moments of really decent and believable acting by relatively unknown actors, most notably the role of Lillian.(4) A clever concept (even though it goes way overboard and ends up ruining a good idea --See Miss #1 below).The Misses:(1) After serious complaints aboutThe Blair Witch Projectvideo camera idea that included too much shaking, you would think Hollywood would be careful about this again.  Sadly, not only did Hollywood NOT listen to those complaints, but they must have considered the idea to be so good that they amped up the camera shaking even more to the point where they make ""Blair Witch"" look like still life.  I was fairly okay with that film, but I could clearly see how others could get sick from 90 minutes of a shaking camera.Hud, the video guy in this film, Cloverfield, seems to have Parkinson's Disease or something as he shoots EVERY scene as if he's standing on the San Andreas Fault line in California.  Even the relaxed party shots are barely stable and that brings me to the invention that is ignored by this film: Image Stabilization.  While it can't correct or compensate for EXTREME camera shaking, it does do an adequate job for the average videographer and is available on almost every camcorder post 1995.  It is just overkill of a good idea.Besides myself and my family I did witness many in the theater either become sick and not look at the screen and/or literally leave the theater.  I even had friends warn me that shaky camera usage would likely make me sick, but having been fine with the Bourne films and only a little annoyed with ""Blair Witch"", I really thought it was an exaggeration about how bad the shaking camera gimmick was in this film.  I have to honestly admit that they were right and I was wrong.  Yes, I'm sure this is ALL opinion and some will have no problem with camera shaking thing, but that's what a review IS, it is one person's opinion and this is mine based upon my experience.(2) Stupid use of video camera.  Let's see, a good friend is seriously wounded, but instead of putting down the camera he wishes him luck, then feels bad and eventually agrees to drag him to safety while still never stopping the camera.  This is beyond belief even if people do act weird under stress.  In fact, this is just one of far too many scenes in which anyone would put down the camera or shut it off temporarily to help someone or do an everyday task.  I mean, would anyone really record (look through their viewfinder) while leaping from one building or another?(3) No quiet moments (and no moments of the camera not shaking) for us to catch our breaths or hold down our popcorn with all the stomach turning induced filming.  Even the best action films have slower moments that allow the audience to catch their breaths and absorb the action a bit.  This film doesn't allow for that especially with the shaking camera concept.  I think just a few well-placed quiet non-shaking camera moments could have made a real difference with the overall feel of this film.(4) Am I the only one to notice that ALL these young ""professionals"" all look like they haven't slept in weeks or had time to ""clean up"" even just a little.  What is with the silly stereotypes of our young people all looking and sounding like surfer-dudes (in New York no less).  All the guys have 2 day old beards coming in (didn't that go out with Don Johnson on Miami Vice?), uncombed hair to the point where they make Ryan Seacrest look well-groomed on his worst day, suits in desperate need of pressing as if that was ever in style, and speak like they are all still in high school.  No one sounds like they are college educated or that they are a real vice president of a company (at 25???).(5)  I grew up in New York and Manhattan is one big island, so why is it that EVERYWHERE these folks go, the monster is there?  You want to debate with me the size of New York City, go ahead, but that doesn't justify how at every turn these folks make the monster is there like Jason stalking teenagers in those Friday the 13th films.  It is just too much to swallow.--------------------------------------------------------------------------For me, this film had an excellent idea and an outstanding special effects team, but that just went out of control.  Exaggerated video camera shaking, horrific and unbelievable dialogue, and a collection of look-alike stereotypical characters severely hamper this film.  With some  serious editing this could have been a much better film.  Sadly, this was a very negative experience for me and my family as my daughter (11) seriously couldn't watch the film as the shaking camera was just too much for her, and my son (15) nearly threw up his popcorn and hated the whole film.  We all left the theater with pounding headaches and that is NOT why we go to the movies.  I still gave this film two stars for the ""hits"" I mentioned earlier, but it was a dud for me overall.FINAL NOTE:  If you want camera shaking for the realistic quality it can bring to a film WITHOUT it making you sick, then try any of the Bourne films (The Jason Bourne Collection (The Bourne Identity / The Bourne Supremacy / The Bourne Ultimatum)).  Camera shaking doesn't have to lead to a nauseating experience (or a family rebellion --lol).  Hey, not everyone is going to agree on the value of a film and whether it made them sick or not and such, but that is why a review is a personal opinion.  If you agree with my review, fine; that's nice.  If you don't, and I know that many don't considering the film's popularity, then feel free to disagree with me and/or write your own review, but leave the personal assaults out of it. This review is just my personal opinion on this film and you are free to accept or reject it.",2,I can sum up this film in three words: Image Stabilization Needed!,1201392000,"01 27,

Hasting ""MEDIA DEMON""","[3, 4]","I didn't get to see this film while it was in the theaters, but when it came to DVD, I puchased a copy without having to see the film.  I am a longtime lover of monster movies, especially the Godzilla series and like the filmakers I always felt America needed it's monster besides King Kong (and that ridiculouse excuse for a Godzilla movie in 1998).  What I found upon viewing was a very interesting approach to monster movie making.  I'm not altogether sure it works, but it still makes for a very entertaining 90 minutes.I like the handheld camera approach, although it can be a bit hard to watch at times.  I understand that the filmakers had to take this approach because of buget constraints.  It was very interesting to see the whole disaster unfold from the eyes of the victims.  The problem that I have with this approach is that you don't get too many chances to get a really good look at the monster.  Perhaps if a sequel is made, they could mix the handheld footage with the regular style of filmaking.Another problem I have is the cast with the exception of one girl was a complete waste.  I can't stand the fake pseudo-intellectual, pseudo-trendy and ultra snooty young New Yorkers and to have to suffer through these fools for the first 20 minutes was almost nauseating.  Hud was the absolute worst of the bunch and I did not find him the least bit funny.  Maybe next time out we can get a cast of characters that the public will actually care about.My final problem with the movie is the design of the monster.  With the way the Cloverfield monster was designed along with the color scheme they used, it's hard to tell what's an arm, what's a leg, is that a tentacle?, and where's the head.  I think the monster needed a little more defining.Now that all of the bad stuff is out of the way, I thought this was an exceptional monster movie and I would gladly see a sequel.  There's some very real moments of terror and the scenes of devastating destruction are just amazing, especially lady liberty's head rolling down the street.I would recommend this movie to any monster movie fan.  It may have it's problems, but it may also be the start of a wonderful thing.",4,America now has it's own monster!!!!!!,1209513600,"04 30, 2008",2008,2178,"['did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'theaters', 'when', 'came', 'DVD', 'puchased', 'copy', 'having', 'see', 'film', 'am', 'longtime', 'lover', 'monster', 'movies', 'especially', 'Godzilla', 'series', 'filmakers', 'always', 'felt', 'America', 'needed', 'monster', 'King', 'Kong', 'ridiculouse', 'excuse', 'Godzilla', 'movie', '1998', 'What', 'found', 'viewing', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'approach', 'monster', 'movie', 'making', ""'m"", 'not', 'altogether', 'sure', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', '90', 'minutes.I', 'handheld', 'camera', 'approach', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'understand', 'filmakers', 'had', 'take', 'approach', 'buget', 'constraints', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'whole', 'disaster', 'unfold', 'eyes', 'victims', 'problem', 'have', 'approach', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'many', 'chances', 'get', 'really', 'good', 'look', 'monster', 'Perhaps', 'sequel', 'made', 'could', 'mix', 'handheld', 'footage', 'regular', 'style', 'filmaking.Another', 'problem', 'have', 'cast', 'exception', 'one', 'girl', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'fake', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'pseudo-trendy', 'ultra', 'snooty', 'young', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'have', 'suffer', 'fools', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'was', 'almost', 'nauseating', 'Hud', 'was', 'absolute', 'worst', 'bunch', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'least', 'bit', 'funny', 'Maybe', 'next', 'time', 'can', 'get', 'cast', 'characters', 'public', 'will', 'actually', 'care', 'about.My', 'final', 'problem', 'movie', 'design', 'monster', 'way', 'Cloverfield', 'monster', 'was', 'designed', 'color', 'scheme', 'used', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'arm', 'what', 'leg', 'tentacle', 'where', 'head', 'think', 'monster', 'needed', 'little', 'more', 'defining.Now', 'bad', 'stuff', 'way', 'thought', 'was', 'exceptional', 'monster', 'movie', 'would', 'gladly', 'see', 'sequel', 'very', 'real', 'moments', 'terror', 'scenes', 'devastating', 'destruction', 'are', 'just', 'amazing', 'especially', 'lady', 'liberty', 'head', 'rolling', 'down', 'street.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'monster', 'movie', 'fan', 'may', 'have', 'problems', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'start', 'wonderful', 'thing']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release
659043,A2M8CILGD2NNPI,B00005JPXY,"Steven Yates ""free your mind""","[3, 5]","I was eagerly awaiting this film, especially given the secrecy surrounding its main themes prior to its theatrical release: was it another 'aliens invade the U.S.' flick or what? We now have *some* of the answers!First things first: if you suffer from motion sickness, you may want to give this film a pass. Adventurous director-and-producer team Matt Reeves and J.J. Abrams make use of the camcorder-POV and give Blair Witch Project a real run for its money. They add realism to this POV by showing us snippets of a video two of the main characters Rob Hawkins and Beth MacIntyre (Michael Stahl-David, Odette Yustman) shot about a month before being recorded over by accident. I started to call this review *BWP Meets Godzilla*, but that seemed like a cheap shot that doesn't do justice to an interesting, creative, and disconcerting flick that has gained a substantial cult following.For the first 18 minutes, little of interest happens unless you're into lower Manhattan upscale yuppie drama: Rob's going away party takes a downturn when Beth (from the earlier video) shows up with another guy. Suddenly, everything begins shaking and the lights flicker. Hud (T.J. Miller) - the guy with the camcorder - focuses our attention shakily on a news broadcast reporting that a tanker has capsized near the Statue of Liberty. The group goes to the roof to see if they can see anything. An explosion south of them sends flaming debris raining across the sky driving them back indoors and down to street level.Moments later is one of this film's best special effects, as the badly damaged head of the Statue of Liberty careens down into the street in front of them. In the distance, the Woolworth Building collapses. The group is driven back indoors again by the wall of dust and debris. Hud's camcorder caught something nasty moving into the city, prompting an ""It's alive!"" What is it?As the plot unfolds, we learn: a creature the size of a skyscraper has attacked the city. From the character Marlena (Lizzy Caplan): ""It's eating people!"" The group makes a sensible decision to get out, crossing the Brooklyn Bridge with a crowd of evacuees. Rob is trying to contact Beth on his cell. He learns that she is trapped in her apartment, injured and unable to move. Then a more immediate tragedy strikes: the creature attacks and knocks out a portion of the bridge's support structure, sending a large portion of the Brooklyn Bridge down into the river. Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) is killed.Rob again reaches Beth. He wants to rescue her. An argument ensues over the wisdom of this, but Rob - feeling guilty about how he'd treated her earlier - convinces the group to attempt a rescue. Their odyssey takes them through a subway station and into a tunnel where they must fight off nasty-looking parasites that ""fell"" from the larger creature. Marlena is bitten. At the other end they encounter a military unit that is evacuating the city. While in their makeshift facility, Marlena comes to a bloody end. Rob wants to leave for Beth's place. Those in charge of the facility won't stop him, but everyone leaves at 0600 the following morning. Be back or be trapped in the ruined city.To shorten this account, the group reaches Beth - in her badly damaged apartment building they must access through the roof from a neighboring tower. She has been impaled through her shoulder on a piece of rebar. They rescue her, then make their way back to the street and to where the helicopters are leaving.Do Rob and Beth make it out of the city? Watch the film! But bewarned: the helicopter scene is particularly dizzying, and then something happens that will make you jump ten feet. Yes, we get a close-up of the monster before it chows down on our hapless camcorder operator. The camcorder-POV has enabled Matt Reeves to direct this film in a stream-of-immediacy mode, freeing him of the need to explain what the creature is or where it came from. (The Wikipedia entry for this movie tells us that during the final clip of the earlier, recorded-over video, an object can be seen falling from the sky. I watched that scene over and over, but couldn't see anything.)I have a few problems with the film, which explains the lack of five stars. (1) Rob has just lost his brother. Would he even be thinking about rescuing a girl he spent one night and one day with? (2) The other characters seem oddly nonchalant about Marlena's bite, as nasty-appearing as the parasites themselves. (3) Beth had been impaled on a piece of rebar in her apartment. I can't see three people simply lifting her off of it, followed by her getting up and joining them in getting out of the building and to a waiting helicopter. It is much more likely she would be in too much pain for that, and would lie there until she bled to death. (4) My biggest complaint: I have trouble visualizing a guy running through the streets, fending off attacking parasites, leaping across a debris-encumbered roof, etc., while filming everything on a camcorder.None of these complaints need prevent your enjoyment of a nice combination of elements with more than a few genuine scares! I'm already hearing rumors about a Cloverfield 2 going into production.",4,"""It's Alive!""

As for Cloverfield all I had seen was the image of the original poster showing the decapitated Statue of Liberty. I had a gut feeling it was a movie similar to Independence Day where Earth is attacked by alients. But I didn't have the faintest idea of what was in store. What an innovative and creative film. The creativity and screenplay are brilliant. Personal video has become a habit these days and expanding that idea into making a horror movie was brilliant. The screenplay (if you haven't watched the trailer) doesn't let you find out what the movie is all about and keeps you guessing for quite some time. Full points to director Matt Reeves and crew. I understand that this movie could give you a pain in your neck or your head (maybe even make you dizzy) in the Cinema hall but on your monitor at home it is perfect. The screen can get dark at times but not compromising on clarity and whatever needs to be seen is clearly visible. Talk of a sequel is being circulated on the net and I am sure it will be well worth the wait. There is a point in the movie where two video makers meet. So it is only interesting and curious to know what the other person has also filmed. Instead of spilling more on spoilers I will recommed this film very highly to any ardent movie lover. 10 stars.,5,"Clever, Creative, Brilliant!",1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,1389,"['Most', 'time', 'avoid', 'watching', 'trailers', 'sometimes', 'give', 'away', 'much', 'what', 'movie', 'Cloverfield', 'had', 'seen', 'was', 'image', 'original', 'poster', 'showing', 'decapitated', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'had', 'gut', 'feeling', 'was', 'movie', 'similar', 'Independence', 'Day', 'where', 'Earth', 'attacked', 'alients', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'faintest', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'store', 'What', 'innovative', 'creative', 'film', 'creativity', 'screenplay', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Personal', 'video', 'become', 'habit', 'days', 'expanding', 'idea', 'making', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'brilliant', 'screenplay', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'trailer', ""n't"", 'let', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'movie', 'keeps', 'guessing', 'quite', 'time', 'Full', 'points', 'director', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'crew', 'understand', 'movie', 'could', 'give', 'pain', 'neck', 'head', 'maybe', 'even', 'make', 'dizzy', 'Cinema', 'hall', 'monitor', 'home', 'perfect', 'screen', 'can', 'get', 'dark', 'times', 'not', 'compromising', 'clarity', 'needs', 'be', 'seen', 'clearly', 'visible', 'Talk', 'sequel', 'being', 'circulated', 'net', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'wait', 'point', 'movie', 'where', 'two', 'video', 'makers', 'meet', 'only', 'interesting', 'curious', 'know', 'what', 'other', 'person', 'also', 'filmed', 'Instead', 'spilling', 'more', 'spoilers', 'will', 'recommed', 'film', 'very', 'highly', 'ardent', 'movie', 'lover', '10', 'stars']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

659047,A3K91X9X2ARDOK,B00005JPXY,"Terrence A. ""cinemaparker@twitter""","[2, 4]","Cloverfield comes off a pretty decent run in theaters and into our homes on  DVD. I enjoyed this movie in the theater and felt that it did a pretty good job in creating a true-to-life enactment of New York City being attacked by a giant monster of unknown origin and what it would be like to experience something like that first hand. Even on DVD, the urgency of the film's storytelling style manages to come through and even though I had already watched the film prior and it was lacking the jarring effect of seeing it on a huge screen, it still managed to strike a chord of uneasiness with me, helped to no end by several shots which serve to remind the viewer of the tragic events of 9/11. Many people had a problem with the ""shakycam"" style of the film which bears more than a striking resemblance to the mayhem that was ""The Blair Witch Project"". The shakycam in this flick didn't really bug me as much as it did some other folks but to some it may be intolerable. You may want to keep this detail in mind if you suffer from motion sickness in any way. Also of annoyance to some was the cast of twenty-something hipsters who get little to no background development in the film and exist solely to get it in any number of different ways. I sort of agree with the consensus on this but hey, I didn't come to watch a Generation X (or whatever generation this is) angst fest, I came to see New York get destroyed by a giant monster, and that I definitely got. All in all, I think the film is at least worth a watch, especially if you like the giant monster movies of old.The film is presented very well with great picture and great sound. When the military attacks the creature early on, you'll feel like you're in the middle of a live firefight and it's one of the films best moments. It's kind of funny to think that you'd get a full Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mix off of something that is basically supposed to be shot with a home video camera but hey, I won't say anything if you don't.Watching the bonus features on the disc, I've walked away from it with even more respect for the film. There are docs on the making of the film and some behind the scenes stuff on the special effects which was mind blowing. I was surprised to learn that most of the film was shot in L.A. and that most of the New York scenes were done with bluescreen. Watching the film, the effects blend in seamlessly and the featurette shows just how much painstaking detail went into these scenes. I'd definitely recommend this as must-see viewing to fans of the film. The commentary is worth a listen and contains some interesting insight into the films genesis and production.In the end, it comes down to this: I wouldn't recommend this disc to the many people who could not stand this film. There's nothing here that will make anyone who hated it the first time around enjoy it this time. I liked it and have no problem recommending it to the people who did though.Just one thing: that fantastic teaser trailer that played before Transformers, the one that worked up all that buzz for the film? Nowhere on this disc, unless it's an easter egg that I missed. Kinda strange not to include it, if you ask me.",4,"Shakycam, giant monsters from who knows where and hipsters for the killing",1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,3187,"['Cloverfield', 'off', 'pretty', 'decent', 'run', 'theaters', 'homes', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'theater', 'felt', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'creating', 'true-to-life', 'enactment', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'being', 'attacked', 'giant', 'monster', 'unknown', 'origin', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'experience', 'something', 'first', 'hand', 'Even', 'DVD', 'urgency', 'film', 'storytelling', 'style', 'come', 'even', 'had', 'already', 'watched', 'film', 'prior', 'was', 'lacking', 'jarring', 'effect', 'seeing', 'huge', 'screen', 'still', 'managed', 'strike', 'chord', 'uneasiness', 'helped', 'end', 'several', 'shots', 'serve', 'remind', 'viewer', 'tragic', 'events', '9/11', 'Many', 'people', 'had', 'problem', 'shakycam', 'style', 'film', 'more', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'mayhem', 'was', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'shakycam', 'flick', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'bug', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'other', 'folks', 'may', 'be', 'intolerable', 'may', 'want', 'keep', 'detail', 'mind', 'suffer', 'motion', 'sickness', 'way', 'Also', 'annoyance', 'was', 'cast', 'twenty-something', 'hipsters', 'who', 'get', 'little', 'background', 'development', 'film', 'exist', 'solely', 'get', 'number', 'different', 'ways', 'sort', 'agree', 'consensus', 'hey', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'watch', 'Generation', 'X', 'generation', 'angst', 'fest', 'came', 'see', 'New', 'York', 'get', 'destroyed', 'giant', 'monster', 'definitely', 'got', 'think', 'film', 'least', 'worth', 'watch', 'especially', 'like', 'giant', 'monster', 'movies', 'old.The', 'film', 'presented', 'very', 'well', 'great', 'picture', 'great', 'sound', 'When', 'military', 'attacks', 'creature', 'early', ""'ll"", 'feel', ""'re"", 'middle', 'live', 'firefight', 'one', 'films', 'best', 'moments', 'kind', 'funny', 'think', ""'d"", 'get', 'full', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'surround', 'mix', 'something', 'basically', 'supposed', 'be', 'shot', 'home', 'video', 'camera', 'hey', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', ""don't.Watching"", 'bonus', 'disc', ""'ve"", 'walked', 'away', 'even', 'more', 'respect', 'film', 'are', 'docs', 'making', 'film', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'blowing', 'was', 'surprised', 'learn', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'L.A.', 'most', 'New', 'York', 'scenes', 'were', 'done', 'bluescreen', 'Watching', 'film', 'effects', 'blend', 'seamlessly', 'featurette', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'painstaking', 'detail', 'went', 'scenes', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'must-see', 'viewing', 'fans', 'film', 'commentary', 'listen', 'interesting', 'insight', 'films', 'genesis', 'production.In', 'end', 'down', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'disc', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'film', 'nothing', 'here', 'will', 'make', 'anyone', 'who', 'hated', 'first', 'time', 'enjoy', 'time', 'liked', 'have', 'problem', 'recommending', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'though.Just', 'one', 'thing', 'fantastic', 'teaser', 'trailer', 'played', 'Transformers', 'one', 'worked', 'up', 'buzz', 'film', 'Nowhere', 'disc', 'easter', 'egg', 'missed', 'Kinda', 'strange', 'not', 'include', 'ask']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

659049,A30XVXQHZAYMPL,B00005JPXY,TGav,"[2, 8]","So, feeling like a big idiot for spending hard-earned cash to see this garbage film? Did they stamp the word ""Sucker!"" on your forehead as you left the theater? Bought the DVD? Worse yet, did you take a date to this movie and thereby ruined the occasion?Fear not! You are not alone. Here's an easy way to recoup some lost dignity (though not your cash), maybe even gain a bit of respect: intellectualize and philosophize about it.First, you must throw out the notion that you saw a horror-sci-fi-monster flick. No, no, no...what you experienced was actually symbolism, social commentary, and psychological analysis. Forget the puerile suggestions of a Sept. 11th allegory; you must delve much, much deeper than that.Our cinematic journey begins in NYC's Central PArk West with a bit of morning-after nonsense involving our protagonist and this babe. They video tape a date to Coney Island (how quaint), then quickly moves to a SoHo loft party the following month. A lot has happened in the interim: our hero received an uber promotion in his company but this requires relocating to Japan; also, we are subtly informed that our hero and his girl friend have remained incommunicado since that one night stand the previous month. Why? Beats me, but for someone so savvy as to live in a SoHo loft, move up the corporate (we assume) ladder and land a dream job while still in his early twenties, he sure comes across as a Hamlet-esque dolt. But I digress.On the occasion of this party we meet the next group of unidimensional characters- a ""how-dare-I-be-so-beautiful"" clique of upper echelon Obama voter types. In other words, just the sorta people you'd expect to live and party in SoHo. There's the best friend whose portable camera documents the events as they happen (in the process recording over the tape of the lovers' date to Coney Island, but more on that later). Then there's our hero's brother and two other babes, one of which is truly stunning.Believe it or not, tension builds at the party (Say it ain't so, TGav!). Our protagonist feels chagrined that his former girlfriend arrives towing some Adonis looking dude and he lets her know it. She storms out. Our hero then wallows in self pity ""woe is me"" moment. Now the fun begins.Far away explosions, the lights flicker. This being L.A. it must be earthquake...err.. NO...scratch that... This being Kansas it must be tornadoes... whoops..let's try again...this being NYC it must be terrorists. Okies, lets go with that. But of course this is not the case. We are teased with a glimpse of a tail here, a shadow there. Flaming debris falls from the heavens faster than you can say ""a screaming comes across the sky"". Pandemonium ensues. Everyone bolts to the streets below.Now comes the ""money shot"" of this movie. IMO, a good 50% of gross ticket sales this movie made can be attributed to this one scene ubiquitous in trailers and commercials. Yes, none other than the Lady Liberty head conveniently landing scratched but otherwise intact despite the distance and velocity catapulted (they don't make statues like they used to) just as our heroes emerge outside. Sadly,the director neglected to include dead tourists mangled corpses visible in the crown, which is the statue's observation deck and usually full of people. Granted, the action took place late at night, but would've been a nice touch anyway. Maybe it can be CGed in the BluRay release. But I digress again.Now, once we realize that what we have here is in fact a monster run amok in NYC and bent on mayhem and destruction, we could've had a nice formulaic H'wood flick. But nooooooo. The director instead turns cerebral and tries to learn us somethin. So furrow your brow, sport a concerned look as you slowly stroke your chin and ponder the double-secret meaning behind this waste of perfectly good celluloid (or videotape, as the case may be).You see, life gets more complicated the older we are and full of bitter sacrifices. Despite his great professional gains our hero has lost his own liberty, the freedom of choice is kept in check by consequences, in this case abandoning his true love in order to seize an opportunity. He realizes this I think in the alley as they run. His friends, too, chose, to their detriment. Somethings sacrificed, however, cannot be undone. Just don't try to convince our hero of  that. Or his ditsy entourage.And waht of the monster? What is it? Where did it come from? Notice its inexplicable appearance just after the girlfriend makes her exit and how it follows the group during their forlorn quest. Could it be a symbol of our hero's angst and inner turmoil of love lost never to be regained, of regrets, the chaos of his life in general despite its superficial attractiveness? In the brilliant 1985 movie ""Brazil"", the hero Sam Lowry fantasizes a battle against a giant Samurai warrior, which symbolizes suppressive totalitarianism. Similarly, this creature could be just a symbolic figment of the protagonist's imagination as he sits there morose and all at his own party pondering his past decisions.Or perhaps he willed it to be real, to destroy the material world which entraps him. Much like in Ghost Busters, but instead of Mr. Stay Puft marshmallow sailor let lose in NY, this time it's the Mother-of-All-Sushi monster giving lower MAnhattan some payback. And how apropos the Godzilla analogy considering he's moving to Japan! Had it been PAris where he was going, I'd have expected millions of arrogant waiters materializing to ridicule everyone's taste in wine thus driving all Americans to suicidal madness. Not quite the dramatic effect though.It kills his brother, his best friends, it destroys the only shred of innocence and happiness remaining in his life up until then. We see only a few moments here and there of the original tape recording they made in Coney Island when life was still simple and less grown up. Interestingly, this patchy broken glimpse into that day is about as much as we see of the creature itself. We can understand it but never appreciate it in full and uninterrupted.And in the end? A sense of final happiness as the recording ends and the tape continues with the original footage of an earlier life. So does the indestructible monster finally die, defeated by the couple's admission of love? That depends if you're a romantic or an existentialist.This was one lousy movie smartly but deceitfully marketed. It is nauseating not because of the faux-amateur hand-held camera technique, but rather by virtue of its amateurish acting, simpleton plot if taken at face value, and arrogant presentation. If I pay to see a brain dead monster flick, then please deliver what I want. I can get plenty of allegory from reading Dante, and there's plenty of honest experimental and enigmatic cinema out there without the need to ambush the public.But oh, yeah, I forget..it's a deep movie.

Cloverfield is a great update on the gigantic-monster genre.  I was very impressed by this movie.  It gives you just enough character development at the beginning to let you know who you are traveling with and then, literally, BOOM.  All hell breaks loose and you're in for the ride.  The monster is great, the pacing lets you take a breather between the intense action sequences, and the actors act like real people caught up in extraordinary events.

659051,A3C0WSRUOCD8IG,B00005JPXY,That Review Guy,"[3, 5]","I really was hoping for a more classic monster film not unlike the godzilla films but with a newer twist. well I got part of that deal. the cgi monster scenes and building destruction were all done very well and quite realistic. However, the camera jerking around about every 15 seconds truly does seem to dizzy you a bit. (this was the directors idea to make it seem as if amature filmographers were filming this. the effect is realistic but still annoying) which bothered me and the sound can get almost Nerve grating with the background talking at the party to the screaming. then there is truly a lack of a story other then as of you were watching someones turned in film of a monster attack on new york without having ben edited by the news station. although there are some highlights to this film such as watching a tank and military with bazookas etc running around new york (considering 9/11 was surprised to see a tank!) also as I stated before some of the city destruction scenes were stunningly done and very realistic. also the critter itself was a really new type of monster that you really would want to run from very quickly. and the little ones were just so spider like and nasty as to truly make sure if the big one didn't make you run those should. not these kids though. the main character (who's unfortunate going away party this was) absolutely HAS to get to his EX-Girlfriend to save her from this beastie that has demolished a good part of new york. that's a little much for me. this film was done in a very annoying ""Blair witch project"" style with jerky camera motions (if you get motion sick bring drammamine) and while was done way better, can not garner more then 3 stars from me because the sound and annoying video just killed a good 2 stars off this one for me.CGI: excellent special effects 5 stars.Video quality: 1 star horribly annoying jerking motions throughout the film (too add realism but still...) 2 stars could have been done realistic without being a complete nooblet to filming. my cousins kids can do better.Sound: Horrible in most of the beginning and towards the end cannot hear the people too well due to the background chatter and noise (again for realism and it makes it seem real but about as amusing as watching a poorly filmed home video) 1 staracting and Overall: acting was ok about what you would expect from most of the kids (with the daft exception of the guy and his ex.) and the film while really superbly done in some spots has so many flaws I cannot give more then 3 stars to a film that finally had the potential to be a masterpiece.buy it here and see for yourself!&lt;link will be inserted when available>Cloverfield",3,Sadly Did Not Meet

659052,AB0WO69IUZAYV,B00005JPXY,T. Hawkes,"[9, 20]","First, the simple ""sound bite"": Hated it!Now, for a bit more commentary....This ""movie"" represented--to me at least--much of what I think is wrong with the current state of ""television entertainment."" The fact that this work was represented as a ""movie"" (rather than as a long episode of a ""Reality TV"" show) was its only real novelty. I can summarize the good and the bad aspects of this work as follows:The Good1- It wasn't too long.2- The CGI effects of the monsters and the destruction of NYC were surprisingly good.3- There was some excitement generated by some of the scenes (although in each case they were cliques that were not original ideas by any means).4- Ah, I was able to rent it for free (I had a coupon).The Bad1- It seemed really, really long (and was mostly boring except when the CGI was in full bloom). I suppose that perhaps a case could be made for fast-forwarding through the DVD just to see the CGI scenes.2- Although the monster part of the story was a tiny bit novel, the ""characters"" and their dramas were not at all interesting or original. Of course, for a generation that's used to the depth of drama in most so-called ""Reality TV"" shows, the ""script"" made perfect sense. Watch the party scene (if you can stomach it) for a second or even third time. Then try to imagine how these characters and their motivations might be portrayed in a ""real"" movie with a real script and real actors. See? This is very-dumb-made-for-Reality-TV stuff could never be translated into a proper dramatic movie. Of course, this is one reason why the producer (the ""Lost"" guy) could get away with making this movie...he didn't need to spend any money on actors or a scriptwriter because he knew so much would be ""forgiven"" because it would, after all, be ""seen"" by the viewers as being ""filmed"" by a kid using a hand-held HD camcorder. Neat, huh?3- Speaking of ""scripts"" (or the lack thereof), the characters are made to do some really stupid things for some really stupid reasons. There are some very large plot holes throughout, too. The simple motivation of the main male character (the guy who suddenly says ""I've got to go back and get my girlfriend in spite of the fact it will mean all our deaths including my brother who was killed before my eyes"") was needed to keep all the characters in the line of fire. But the fact that the three follow-along characters are actually dumb enough to go along with the ""hero"" simply shows (to me) how stupid kids are today. At the very least, the script is making a cynical comment in assuming that teenagers (or 20-somethings) can be expected to act like sheep in such a ""disaster.""4- The fact that the lights stay on (nearly everywhere) in spite of the major damage being done to NYC is a very-hard-to-believe plot device. But the plot device of the cellphone that works well enough (and several times at that) to allow the trapped girl to call her boyfriend and plead for his help is absolutely beyond belief. But, again, to the intended audience who are literally tied to their cellphones and iPods and who generally don't care how those things actually work (i.e., they are little radios that depend on big radios working) it makes perfect sense. That is, the expectation of a suspension of disbelief by the intended audience is logical, but only in a cynical sense.5- Regarding the long sequence of the three characters climbing up the stairs to the top of a building and then jumping over to the almost-ready-to-collapse building in which the hero's ""girl"" is trapped because she is impaled on a piece of rebarb....wow, I'm almost breathless just from trying to explain the crazy plot! As I mentioned earlier, the tag-along characters are represented as sheep who (in spite of an opportunity to get out of town with the military) are willing to follow their ""hero"" just so they can fill some time or ""hang with him"" or be there to capture his heroics on video....(wow: breathless again). Well, here these people are no longer characters--they become actors in a scripted scene. At this point, the audience will ""believe"" anything, therefore the characters can be made to ""do anything"" without regard for their safety or sanity or--dare I say it?--basic physics in the real world. My point here is that because of all the stupid things the kids have done so far in the story we expect (and actually we need) the characters to be able to safely rescue the poor girl (who oddly isn't dead from a loss of blood and who survives being pulled off the metal rebarb that is holding her and can actually manage to walk down the building with ease...). Once they all get back into the building they climbed up in I thought for one vain moment that there was hope that one of the small monster creatures would grab the hurt girl (or all of them for that matter) and stab her to death. If that happened at least there'd be some irony in this story. But no, the secondary hero (who actually is killed later by the big bad monster itself) is able to put the camera down long enough to kill the nasty small monster. And then they all move along nicely and quickly to the bottom floor and out the building. Sweet. What a cool story. Makes perfect sense. No trouble at all; they saved the dude's girl. Naturally.6- The camera work throughout was both bad and good. It was good in the sense that it captured some of the ""reality"" of a hand-held camera. But, it was bad in the sense that the kid who was operating the camera couldn't have captured the actual video that was shown (i.e., the video was ""too good"" too much of the time). Of course, if this ""video"" were shown as being truly ""Blair Witch"" quality, no one would have watched this movie all the way through. [We have to have some standards you know. This is a movie of the week! We want people to think it is real but not too real!]7- The resolution of the story (i.e., everyone dies except the one girl who, presumably, gets out on the first helicopter) is so typical of all of today's end-of-the-world scripts. The hero/heroine die for no reason really except because it's in the script. Come on...what happened to the dramas of yesteryear? In the past (before 9/11), stories of the end of the world (from whatever cause) would end in an emotionally satisfying way: that is, most or at least some of the main characters would survive due to their actions or dumb luck. But they survived. We want them to survive....that's the point of these stories. If you don't believe me, go back and study the history of movies and TV scripts (in this genre at least). The hero/heroine survives somehow. Sadly, in the ""Post 9/11"" scriptwriters guide, everyone (except a random one or two) will die. all these stories end up repeating the ""point"" of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. And that point is this: most will die, it doesn't matter what anyone tries to do...or is made to do by the scriptwriters...they will die. One or two will randomly be saved, but that salvation has no meaning except for pure chance. And that's where I will end this commentary: this ""Reality-TV"" version of the 9/11 attack on NYC is lame.

(Keep in mind that Japan doesn't officially have an ""army"", and isn't officially allowed one, so here it's OK to make them look powerless -- as they don't officially exist!) This is a fantastic movie, though.  I just hope Abrams doesn't try to build on this particular monster, Clover, in the same way in the sequel.  I can't see how it could ever work.  Many people in Japan and around the world are quite fond of Godzilla.  I can't see this happening, and wouldn't care to see it attempted, with Clover.  Ah!

The mystery used by Abrams along with the unorthodox storyline helped the story to become fascinating. The special effects were good and creating the illusion of confusion and panic using the video-cam focal point is a nice touch that you'll either love or hate.The biggest problem I have with the film is the idea that a story like this needs a sequel and now that 2 years has passed without even talk of one, buiding up all this detailed backstory, clues and other data was meaningless without a sequel so what Abrams actually accomplished was a lot of smoke and no sizzle. Why invest so much time developing the storyline for an unknown moster when you plan to do nothing with it goes beyond logic. I hope to see a sequel one day although I'd advise Mr. Abrams to tie up all the loose ends with this next version because time on this plot and character has already run it's course and already are problematic. This movie in essence is the definition of ""wasted effort"" and it should have been more than it was. My guess is that they made the film and didn't make the desired income on the project and abandoned it.

659058,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B00005JPXY,The Mysterious Traveler,"[1, 4]","CLOVERFIELD(2008) Directed by Matt Reeves. Written by Drew Goddard. Produced by J. J. Abrams.Starring an exciting cast of young people.When a giant monster attacks Manhattan, five young twenty somethings and their camcorder race about the city alternatively attempting to survive and save the leader's girlfriend.Basically the Blair Witch Project version of a giant monster movie in which the story is told from the point of view of five of the extras that are usually shown running away from the monster, screaming and getting killed. This is interesting as far as it goes but since the milling extras are never directly involved with the plot, they therefore never know anything thusly the audience never learns exactly what is going on either. The camcorder gimmick is interesting to a point but again the viewer only sees what the extras see......and since they ARE extras and not the scientists and/or the military trying to stop the thing....whatever it is..the film is basically about people fleeing swiftly from the plot.AND of paramount importance is that extras in giant monster movies have two functions. To escape and never be seen again or to die horribly. And it does not give too much away is that the ultimate effect is to leave the viewer feeling as if he/she just spent 84 minutes watching people die.It IS sad but it is also a story that could have easily....and should have been a subplot...in a traditional film.It does not help that the protagonists are the most annoying and irritating group of young people imaginable...........escapees from a PORKYS or MTV's REAL WORLD. M. Night Shalmalyan did a variation of this with SIGNS only there it was a small group of people dealing with an Alien invasion from space. His was the far more successful take on the subject primarily because the writer/director took great effort to keep the protagonists--hence the viewer-- informed and thus involved while at the same time making sure the viewer was emotionally connected to the characters. The camcorder/irritating twenty somethings only serve to alienate the viewer from the proceedings while keeping us away from where we really want to be....with the monster.The monster is not especially impressive looking much like the creature that lived in the TV dinner in the ZZ TOP video of the same name...or to be more accessible...a deformed version of the demons from SINBAD AND THE EYE OF THE TIGER. Probably from space, the monster serves no purpose other than to coincidentally always be where ever our heroes happen to be. Since there is no reason to develop the creature, it becomes just an occaisional special effect. It is just there. It is all CGI of course and consequently never feels solid to this viewer. The film is shot on location in Manhattan and it is fun to play spot the location.Not a bad film. Not a good film.

659060,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JPXY,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 5]","""Cloverfield"", the new film from producer JJ Abrams (TV's ""Lost"" and ""Alias"", director of ""Mission Impossible III""), is an interesting, very successful experiment in filmmaking.Rob (Michael Stahl - David) has just received a promotion and a new job in Japan (wink, wink). Before he leaves, his brother, Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas), arrange a surprise party in Rob's midtown Manhattan loft. Jason videotapes the day, borrowing Rob's video camera and videotaping over a tape Rob made of a special day he spent with Beth (Odette Yustman) a week or so earlier. When Rob arrives at the party, his best friend, Hud (T.J. Miller) is in charge of videotaping the events, so Rob will have a keepsake. Everyone is having a good time until Beth shows up with another guy. But Rob barely has time to think about this when the entire building shakes. Everyone rushes to the roof and they see an explosion and chaos near the Hudson River. They rush inside and the news is carrying a story about an oil tanker hitting the Statue of Liberty. They make their way to the street and an explosion a couple of blocks away causes panic. Soon, the head of the Statue of Liberty comes crashing through and pandemonium reigns. Rob, Jason, Hud and Lily try to get someplace safe and they soon realize New York City is being attacked by a large beast. Soon, Rob receives a teary cell call from Beth, who left earlier. Rob is determined to make his way to her apartment and help her. As they proceed, they run into all manner of obstacles and no one is safe. At least Hud is smart enough to keep the camcorder rolling during their journey.The problem with so many monster movies is the filmmakers show the monster way too soon. This is problematic for a variety of reasons. If the monster is, in the slightest, unconvincing, there is no hope of creating any suspense with the audience. Once they see an actor wearing a big rubber suit, or a CGI creation moving awkwardly, nothing else in the film will seem real enough and all hope is lost. If the monster is convincing, and we believe in it, showing it too soon also robs the film of suspense. Once we see the creature, we are no longer thinking about what the creature might be, what caused it to be created, what are the creature's motivations. This opens the rest of the film up for scrutiny. Trust me, most filmmakers who are making a monster film, don't want to invite this scrutiny.Abrams and director Matt Reeves conceived an idea in which the entire film is presented as a Government file, top secret, and obtained from the videotape Hud and Jason shoot throughout the day. Because this is all handheld camera work, the camera turns to look for the source of noises or destruction. The monster destroys something, causing a noise or disturbance, and then Hud and the others turn to look. Naturally, the monster isn't still standing in the same place. If they are lucky, they capture a bit of a leg or a tail on the video before running away. They use this technique in a smart way; because we are watching someone's camcorder, it takes a long time for us to get a good look at the monster, allowing the film to ratchet up the suspense, putting the main characters in a number of situations keeping us on the edge of our seats.The filmmakers have also smartly cast a group of complete unknowns to play the principals in the film. Because we don't recognize any of the actors, we more readily accept they are young people living in New York, we more readily accept they are attending a surprise party for their friend Rob, we more readily accept we are watching a camcorder recording this party and all of the horrific events after it.This film wouldn't work as well if recognizable actors populated the world. ""Move Jessica Alba, move, the monster is about to get you"" is just harder to make work than ""Rob, you really shouldn't go down that dark subway tunnel"". Who's Rob? He's the guy whose going away party was interrupted by a monster attacking the Statue of Liberty. Wait, that's not real? Oh.Thankfully, with the advent of digital camcorders, the images in ""Cloverfield"" are quite good, pretty clear. This isn't ""The Blair Godzilla Project"", filled with grainy, dark images. This camcorder captures a lot of detail and gives us a pretty good view of the destruction, of the terror, of the aftermath of this monster's visit.As Rob and his friends make their way through New York, they meet various obstacles along the way, frightening, dangerous obstacles, adding to the suspense of the film. They work through these moments, trying to remain safe, trying to remain alive, trying to get to Beth.As the film begins, we watch as Rob and Beth wake up in bed together and make some plans to visit Coney Island. Then Jason and Lily at the market, buying some things for the party that night, interrupt the images. They quickly fill us in on the details and it becomes clear Jason has borrowed Rob's video camera and he is clearly videotaping over something else. Throughout the film, these moments with Rob and Beth come through, whenever Hud stops the camera, or there is a brief interruption. Watching these moments of Rob and Beth together help to explain why he is so intent on finding her, making his way through the hazardous streets of New York under attack. These moments also help to add one more moment to the film, making the fact we are watching a handheld camera recording all of these horrific events all the more credible.The film also moves at a fast pace. After spending some time with everyone as they prepare for the party and then meeting everyone at Rob's big night, the monster attacks. These early scenes are necessary to give us the framework for the story. We have to have someone to care for and go on this journey with. But once the monster attacks, our group of partiers is always on the go, trying to stay alive and as far away from this creature as possible. At 90 minutes, the film never lags, providing us with a bit of a roller coaster ride.""Cloverfield"" isn't for everyone; I know a lot of people who can't watch a few minutes of handheld camera work, let alone an entire film. But it is a very good, interesting filmmaking experiment managing to create more suspense and terror than most monster films.",4,The Monster Movie Reborn,1201737600,"01 31,

659061,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B00005JPXY,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[2, 7]","Quite possibley the most disorienting blockbuster I've seen in recent memory,Lostman JJ Abrams makes a movie that is one part 9/11 response, one part Japanese Monster B-Flick and a final partThe Blair Witch Project, then slaps it with the nonsensical title ""Cloverfield."" I have to admit, I've been wanting to see this ever since the viral trailer of the Statue Of Liberty's head flying along the NYC streets first hit the web. And while the movie is pretty darn good for what it is, the hype may have crippled my expectations.The first 10 minutes are an introductory send-off party for Rob, put together by his galpal Lily and brother Jason. Rob's bud Hud is given a shaky videocam to gather testimonials and work up a sweat over Marlena. All his rather self-absorbed friends cluster in the apartment for a late-night booze-up and to spout off bad dialog. Seems Rob's being promoted to some hotshot VP position in (he heh) Japan, when his girlfriend Beth shows up and it's made clear she is about to become an ex. Just as Rob is pouting about crappy girlfriends blowing him off, a very Japanese monster crash lands in Brooklyn with a such a clatter, so everyone rushes outside to see what is the matter. The aforementioned Statue Head goes flying and, before you can say World Trade Center, a collapsed building has our vacuous party-goers (with Hud still holding the camera) fleeing a wall of debris racing up the street.So just like those old 50's B Movie Monsters of old, ""Cloverfield"" substitutes a creepy lizard for our anxieties about creepy Islamofacists. After being forced to watch these yuppie wankers party for about 20 minutes and not giving a rat's beak about them, the movie suddenly kicks into high gear and never lets up. Since everyone else here has griped about the single camera theory, I'll add my two cents. It Was Not Necessary. I mean, even the less expensive DV's these days have stabilizers. However, the racing-up-the-street shots and the subway tunnel piece add to the panicky, claustrophobic nature of ""Cloverfield,"" as does the stumbling comments by our remaining four bewildered would-be rescuers. Seems Rob got a call from ex-Beth, he's feeling valiant in the face of danger, and he somehow manages to convince Hud, Lily, and Marlena to follow him on a rescue mission.That is the plot, in a monster-shell. Hud dutifully films away and cracks bad jokes, but the humor does help blunt the sharpness. The effects - aside from the Dramamine Camera Work - are pretty stunning, too, like the apartment buildings crashed into each other that our rescuers are forced to scale. The military battles are crazed and frenzied, and the mini-monsters that drop off the Mother Monster are inventive. The Monster itself is given added bonus points for being more scary by NOT being seen, then when Hud finally gets a good look at the creature near the movie's end, it really does shock you.The ending was a bit corny, frankly. The Coney Island underlying recording seemed contrived in a movie that is already all about the gimmick. Along with the dizzying camera work, it's the sole other bum note in a movie that nails its genre desires right on the head. By keeping ""Cloverfield"" to a very taut under 90 minute running time (take out the cuss words and this would have been a Sci-Fi channel movie of the week), it drags you along for the thrill-ride and stops just before you get tired of its one trick filming style. By then, you're tabulating the influences and trying to backtrack, which made this a satisfying if somewhat unfulfilling movie for me.",4,The Lost Godzilla Monster Project,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,3570,"['Quite', 'most', 'disorienting', 'blockbuster', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'memory', 'Lostman', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'movie', 'one', 'part', '9/11', 'response', 'one', 'part', 'Japanese', 'Monster', 'B-Flick', 'final', 'partThe', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'then', 'nonsensical', 'title', 'Cloverfield', 'have', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'been', 'wanting', 'see', 'ever', 'viral', 'trailer', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'head', 'flying', 'NYC', 'streets', 'first', 'hit', 'web', 'movie', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'what', 'hype', 'may', 'have', 'crippled', 'expectations.The', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'are', 'introductory', 'send-off', 'party', 'Rob', 'put', 'together', 'galpal', 'Lily', 'Jason', 'Rob', 'bud', 'Hud', 'given', 'shaky', 'videocam', 'gather', 'testimonials', 'work', 'up', 'sweat', 'Marlena', 'rather', 'self-absorbed', 'friends', 'cluster', 'apartment', 'late-night', 'booze-up', 'spout', 'off', 'bad', 'dialog', 'Seems', 'Rob', 'being', 'promoted', 'hotshot', 'VP', 'position', 'Japan', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'Beth', 'up', 'made', 'clear', 'become', 'ex', 'Just', 'Rob', 'pouting', 'crappy', 'girlfriends', 'blowing', 'off', 'very', 'Japanese', 'monster', 'crash', 'lands', 'Brooklyn', 'such', 'clatter', 'everyone', 'rushes', 'see', 'what', 'matter', 'aforementioned', 'Statue', 'Head', 'flying', 'can', 'say', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'collapsed', 'building', 'vacuous', 'party-goers', 'Hud', 'still', 'holding', 'camera', 'fleeing', 'wall', 'debris', 'racing', 'up', 'street.So', 'just', 'old', '50', 'B', 'Movie', 'Monsters', 'old', 'Cloverfield', 'creepy', 'lizard', 'anxieties', 'creepy', 'Islamofacists', 'being', 'forced', 'watch', 'yuppie', 'wankers', 'party', '20', 'minutes', 'not', 'giving', 'rat', 'beak', 'movie', 'suddenly', 'high', 'gear', 'never', 'up', 'everyone', 'else', 'here', 'griped', 'single', 'camera', 'theory', ""'ll"", 'add', 'two', 'cents', 'Was', 'Not', 'Necessary', 'mean', 'even', 'less', 'expensive', 'DV', 'days', 'have', 'stabilizers', 'However', 'racing-up-the-street', 'shots', 'subway', 'tunnel', 'piece', 'add', 'panicky', 'claustrophobic', 'nature', 'Cloverfield', 'stumbling', 'comments', 'remaining', 'four', 'bewildered', 'would-be', 'rescuers', 'Seems', 'Rob', 'got', 'call', 'ex-Beth', 'feeling', 'valiant', 'face', 'danger', 'somehow', 'convince', 'Hud', 'Lily', 'Marlena', 'follow', 'rescue', 'plot', 'monster-shell', 'Hud', 'dutifully', 'away', 'cracks', 'bad', 'jokes', 'humor', 'help', 'blunt', 'sharpness', 'effects', 'aside', 'Dramamine', 'Camera', 'Work', 'are', 'pretty', 'stunning', 'too', 'apartment', 'buildings', 'crashed', 'other', 'rescuers', 'are', 'forced', 'scale', 'military', 'battles', 'are', 'crazed', 'frenzied', 'mini-monsters', 'drop', 'off', 'Mother', 'Monster', 'are', 'inventive', 'Monster', 'given', 'added', 'bonus', 'points', 'being', 'more', 'scary', 'NOT', 'being', 'seen', 'then', 'when', 'Hud', 'finally', 'good', 'look', 'creature', 'movie', 'end', 'really', 'shock', 'you.The', 'ending', 'was', 'bit', 'corny', 'frankly', 'Coney', 'Island', 'underlying', 'recording', 'seemed', 'contrived', 'movie', 'already', 'gimmick', 'dizzying', 'camera', 'work', 'sole', 'other', 'bum', 'note', 'movie', 'genre', 'desires', 'right', 'head', 'keeping', 'Cloverfield', 'very', 'taut', '90', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'take', 'out', 'cuss', 'words', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', 'movie', 'week', 'thrill-ride', 'just', 'get', 'tired', 'one', 'trick', 'filming', 'style', 'then', ""'re"", 'tabulating', 'influences', 'trying', 'backtrack', 'made', 'satisfying', 'somewhat', 'unfulfilling', 'movie']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

Lobascio,"[1, 3]","Internet buzz and rabid speculation surrounded Cloverfield for months, prior to its release on January 18th 2008...The question is: Now that it's finally here--Does the film live up to all of the hype? I say Yes.The Story: On the night of May 22, Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas) throw a surprise going-away party for Jason's brother, Rob (Michael Stahl-David), after he lands a big job promotion that's gonna relocate him to Japan. Just prior to the guest of honor's arrival, Jason asks ""Hud"" (T.J. Miller) to chronicle the festivities of Rob's last night in the U.S. with a hand held camcorder. At first, he is quite reluctant to do so, But as soon as he notices that the object of his affection, Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), is in the room, Hud's ready to roll.Shortly after Rob finally arrives, an argument erupts between Rob and his friend, Beth (Odette Yustman), and Rob confides to his close friends that they had hooked up a month ago. Rob is mad because Beth has arrived with a date. Beth is upset at Rob for not calling her after getting together. She leaves the party abruptly. Hud and Jason then encourage Rob to pursue a romantic relationship with Beth despite the fact he's leaving the country.Suddenly the building rocks with earthquake intensity as loud animal-like noises can be heard outside. From the roof, the friends see a large explosion in the distance and they flee to the street where the head of the Statue of Liberty crashes to the ground. Several more explosions and glimpses of a ginormous creature are visible in the distance... The small group of pals decide that the best way to ensure their survival is to leave Manhattan--But first--they must rescue Beth.The Film: Word is that J.J. Abrams was in line to direct this monster tale, but because he decided to helm the Star Trek reboot, Matt Reeves was asked to step in...No worries though, Cloverfield has plenty of Abrams' style all over it...As written by Drew Goddard the script is exceedingly straightforward and uncluttered--which is one reason why it works. The beginning of the film took me right back to September 11, 2001, with it's stark dismantling of Lady Liberty and scenes of folks running for their lives as utter chaos rains down everywhere.The media has made a big deal over the fact that the ""always in motion"" cinematography has hit some viewers in the gut--causing disorientation and dizziness--I had no trouble at all with that aspect of the film. I was too caught up in the plight of Rob and company...The filmmakers offer just enough of a glimpse of the monster so that we the audience are intrigued to know what the characters are facing-but they wisely keep that to a minimum--Allowing the characters to carry the load rather than special effects or CGI. To that end, the cast does a great job of keeping it ""real"" amid the unreality of it all...It's impossible not to think of the 1999 film The Blair Witch Project which Cloverfield patterns itself after, for sure. From its mysterious marketing campaign, the style of filming--Using no name stars--to its ""ambiguous"" conclusion. It's all there.To me, there's nothing wrong with letting the viewer try and figure things out...Not every flick has to explain the who what and why-for it to work. I just hope that despite the film's success-everyone resists the temptation of a sequel, ala`Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. My way of thinking is that that would only serve to to diminish Cloverfield as a film--if there is a sequel--Leave it alone guys...As is often the case with TV's Lost--Cloverfield poses more questions than it answers. But unlike the serialized drama-I am totally OK with that...For what it is, it's a great monster movie that is a worthy trip to the cineplex...",4,Monster Smash,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,3759,"['Internet', 'buzz', 'rabid', 'speculation', 'surrounded', 'Cloverfield', 'months', 'prior', 'release', 'January', '18th', '2008', 'question', 'Now', 'finally', 'here', 'film', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'say', 'Yes.The', 'Story', 'night', 'May', '22', 'Jason', 'Mike', 'Vogel', 'girlfriend', 'Lily', 'Jessica', 'Lucas', 'throw', 'surprise', 'going-away', 'party', 'Jason', 'brother', 'Rob', 'Michael', 'Stahl-David', 'big', 'job', 'promotion', 'gon', 'relocate', 'Japan', 'Just', 'prior', 'guest', 'honor', 'arrival', 'Jason', 'Hud', 'T.J.', 'Miller', 'chronicle', 'festivities', 'Rob', 'last', 'night', 'U.S.', 'hand', 'held', 'camcorder', 'first', 'quite', 'reluctant', 'do', 'so', 'as', 'soon', 'object', 'affection', 'Marlena', 'Lizzy', 'Caplan', 'room', 'Hud', 'ready', 'roll.Shortly', 'Rob', 'finally', 'argument', 'erupts', 'Rob', 'friend', 'Beth', 'Odette', 'Yustman', 'Rob', 'confides', 'close', 'friends', 'had', 'hooked', 'up', 'month', 'ago', 'Rob', 'mad', 'Beth', 'arrived', 'date', 'Beth', 'upset', 'Rob', 'not', 'calling', 'getting', 'together', 'party', 'abruptly', 'Hud', 'Jason', 'then', 'encourage', 'Rob', 'pursue', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'Beth', 'fact', 'leaving', 'country.Suddenly', 'building', 'rocks', 'earthquake', 'intensity', 'loud', 'animal-like', 'noises', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'outside', 'roof', 'friends', 'see', 'large', 'explosion', 'distance', 'flee', 'street', 'where', 'head', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'crashes', 'ground', 'Several', 'more', 'explosions', 'glimpses', 'ginormous', 'creature', 'are', 'visible', 'distance', 'small', 'group', 'pals', 'decide', 'best', 'way', 'ensure', 'survival', 'leave', 'Manhattan', 'first', 'must', 'rescue', 'Beth.The', 'Film', 'Word', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'was', 'line', 'direct', 'monster', 'tale', 'decided', 'helm', 'Star', 'Trek', 'reboot', 'Matt', 'Reeves', 'was', 'asked', 'step', 'No', 'worries', 'Cloverfield', 'plenty', 'Abrams', 'style', 'written', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'script', 'exceedingly', 'straightforward', 'uncluttered', 'one', 'reason', 'why', 'beginning', 'film', 'took', 'right', 'back', 'September', '11', '2001', 'stark', 'dismantling', 'Lady', 'Liberty', 'scenes', 'folks', 'running', 'lives', 'utter', 'chaos', 'down', 'everywhere.The', 'media', 'made', 'big', 'deal', 'fact', 'always', 'motion', 'cinematography', 'hit', 'viewers', 'gut', 'causing', 'disorientation', 'dizziness', 'had', 'trouble', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'plight', 'Rob', 'company', 'filmmakers', 'offer', 'just', 'enough', 'glimpse', 'monster', 'so', 'audience', 'are', 'intrigued', 'know', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'facing-but', 'wisely', 'keep', 'minimum', 'Allowing', 'characters', 'carry', 'load', 'rather', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'end', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'real', 'unreality', 'impossible', 'not', 'think', '1999', 'film', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Cloverfield', 'sure', 'mysterious', 'marketing', 'campaign', 'style', 'filming', 'Using', 'name', 'ambiguous', 'conclusion', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'letting', 'viewer', 'try', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'Not', 'flick', 'explain', 'who', 'what', 'why-for', 'work', 'just', 'hope', 'film', 'success-everyone', 'temptation', 'sequel', 'ala', 'Book', 'Shadows', 'Blair', 'Witch', '2', 'way', 'thinking', 'would', 'only', 'serve', 'diminish', 'Cloverfield', 'film', 'sequel', 'Leave', 'alone', 'often', 'case', 'TV', 'Lost', 'Cloverfield', 'more', 'questions', 'serialized', 'drama-I', 'am', 'totally', 'OK', 'what', 'great', 'monster', 'movie', 'worthy', 'trip', 'cineplex']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

And the hack-n-slash gorefest crap that passes for horror these days is almost not worth the time it takes to yawn through them.  So when I find a good, solid monster movie that makes me tense up and say ""Oh my god!"" at least once, I know I'm on to something.If you don't already know, Cloverfield is set in post-9/11 Manhattan.  During a Bon Voyage party, something attacks the city, decapitating the Statue of Liberty, in a very memorable moment, and laying waste to the Empire State building, the two most enduring symbols of New York.  Add to that the memory of the events of September 2001, and you have the sense that this story isn't going to end well.There's a breakneck race through the streets and subways of Manhattan, and ever-longer peeks at the monster and its spawn, but there's never enough time to take it all in, never time to allow the mind to process exactly what it is that's happening, so the imagination takes over, which any old school horror aficionado will tell you is the most effective way to scare the bejeebers out of someone.  Let their mind do the work for you, let them imagine what is happening, what could happen, what will happen.The casting of relative unknowns and the use of a near-real-time narrative are both critical to allowing the audience to put itself into the story.  I only saw one actor with whom I was familiar, and it did push me right out of the film for a moment because it suddenly registered as just a movie, an entertainment.

659073,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JPXY,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 3]","Cloverfield"" is a J.J. Abrams-produced monster flick shot in ""The Blair Witch"" fashion. And I am not just talking about its shaky hand-held camera; its elaborate marketing tactics also reminds me of the 1999 maga-hit horror movie that turned out not so scary after all. I wouldn't be surprised if there is talk of making a sequel to ""Cloverfield.""The difference is, I think, ""Cloverfield,"" in which something huge and ferocious attacks Manhattan, is really scary when it wants to. The film has several nice shots of the monster and its attack with top-notch visual and sound effects. The process of the total destruction of the city is seen from the viewpoint of ordinary people, and some of the shots including the clouds of dust in the street after buildings collapse are realistic, obvious references to 9/11, but frankly I really don't know these references are necessary.Interestingly, the film's digital camera approach, which is intended to create realism, often makes its images look more artificial. Characters are supposed to be running, but a guy named ""Hud,"" obviously not a professional cameraman, manages to get great shots. He never misses a chance to shoot wherever he is, and he is very good at it, not a shot out of focus. And these people including Hud never really try to leave the city under siege.But I maybe I shouldn't complain. The story of ""Cloverfield"" is only borrowing many elements from other numerous B-monster films, where a small group of main characters must do something heroic when the crowd is running for their lives, and the military is brave but always useless, and so on, the formula Spielberg did in ""War of the World"" (with the 9/11 references again).

659075,A2Y55P7L3NFZ2F,B00005JPXY,"T. Thompson ""Clydesight Productions""","[0, 3]","I found Cloverfield to be a VERY disturbing film, almost compelling in its horror (as in ""I can't look away""), and I think it actually is groundbreaking because of what I think they were trying to do.Although on the surface it may SEEM to be illogical and annoying, a bad effort at making a modern ""Godzilla"" movie, I believe it used a totally new approach to story telling in cinema (and I am NOT talking about that annoying ""first person"", jiggly and wobbily camera stuff).I believe it was trying to break the mold of the usual ""giant monster eats metropolis"" genre. The approach they used makes it the kind of movie that requires some thought to answer the question: ""WHAT were THEY thinking?""And, I think I figured it out.I think that this movie is an attempt to film a nightmare - AS nightmare, using all the elements and techniques that are characteristic of a nightmare. I think it was successful from this point of view. See if some of my observations ring a bell.The Plot:There isn't a plot, and if they were going for filming a nightmare, true to the way nightmare's work, then this is completely appropriate.Have you ever had a dream where you are being chased by a monster? It's terrifying, there's no reason why the monster is there, there is a lot of mayhem going on around you, and you feel terrified and HAVE to run and hide. Only you run to the most illogical places, people around you don't make sense, what they say makes even less sense, and the monster is unbelievably relentless. Stuff of dreams.I think that's what was going on in this movie. And on this level, it worked for me. I left this film (which I have seen twice) feeling that terrible sense of disturbance that a nightmare creates. So I give the film credit for this, IF that is what they intended. (I may be giving them more credit than is due).Because this film is nightmare in cinema, logic doesn't have to work. In fact, logic has no place in a nightmare. So it is with this film. To criticize plot issues for illogical elements is unfair. Dreams don't make much sense.Think of your nightmares, think of this movie, you'll may make the connection.The Characters and Dialog:As in a nightmare, these people are dream characters. They have no more substance than a half realized idea - again, the stuff of dreams. Each represents a persistent train of thought, which is what dream characters are designed to do. Rob is persistent in his quest to save his girlfriend. He represents the nobler emotion of heroism. Hud is persistent in making a video of everything that is happening. He represents our need for constant observation. Hud often missed pointing the camera at things we needed to or wanted to see.How often do WE miss seeing what we need to or want to see?Other characters represent feelings of being victims, feelings of being helpless, and even hopeless.Think of the girl who was bitten by a ""parasite monster"" and later explodes! Ever have one of your ideas ""exploded""? Ever have someone jump on you because of an idea you had and they tear it, and your psyche, apart with harsh criticism?The characters are one dimensional because dream characters are one dimensional. They have nothing of interest to say because, for one thing, given their situation, what could they say? For another, what do your nightmare characters say as the nightmare unfolds?We have no feelings for the characters because we don't have feelings about feelings, which is what these characters are.This is a major departure from usual cinema, and it could be considered groundbreaking.The Monster:The monster is of course, very much the stuff of nightmares. Big, unrelenting, impossible to understand, unmotivated. Monsters in nightmares represent unresolved emotions or conflicts. They are unresolved because we can't figure them out. They are terrifying for the same reason. The mind always tries to find resolution. When it cannot, it views what is the problem as monstrous.So the Cloverfield monster comes out of nowhere, for no reason, and like a monster in a nightmare, you cannot defeat it.That's why everything the military does is of no avail against this monster. Have you ever tried to fight a monster in a nightmare? If you have, you probably know, you can never win. In ""Godzilla"" nothing worked because of his ""atomic shield"" or some other implausible nonsense. In Cloverfield, the monster cannot be defeated because he is an unresolvable situation. Stuff of nightmares.The Rest of the Film:Given that this seems to be a nightmare in cinema, it is interesting to consider the techniques used.Camera Work:A lot of people complain about the camera work, the shakiness, the uneven photography, and so on. I AGREE, it is extremely annoying. However, it may have been necessary to use this technique in order to maintain the heightened sense of terror. ""Normal"" camera work would have been too ""rational"" to work in this type of approach. Still they could have toned it down a bit. But think of nightmares and dreams. How often do we see things cockeyed in them, from impossible perspectives, much as this camera does in the movie?Music:There isn't any. Obviously. Music adds to the story, helps unfold the plot (as when the violins start screeching in more conventional horror films to cue the audience that something bad is about to happen). But in a nightmare, there is no music and no cue. Everything is a surprise, as it is in this movie. So of course, this movie doesn't really have a ""score"". If it did, it could have ruined the nightmare quality.Sound Effects:It was interesting how disturbing the sound effects -- which were all normal expected sounds we hear every day -- in this movie were. When Rob and friends are in the collapsed buildings and the safety buzzers are sounding... that is uncomfortably disturbing. Safety buzzers are supposed to be disturbing, of course, and I think they used this as a completely natural occurrence (since the buildings are running on back-up power) to heighten the fear elements. We are conditioned to be on ""Alert"" when one of these devices is sounding. I always jump when my smoke alarm goes off because I burned the toast. Have you had a similar experience? This film used these everyday sounds to heighten the tension. For me, it was appropriately creepy.Scenery:New York City, even being destroyed, is still a dramatic stage! I think the film makers made good use of it, the empty subway tunnels, the abandoned buildings, taking what is normal (crowded subways and buildings) and turning them around -- making them mysteriously empty. This also heightened the uneasiness of this movie for me. Which led to...A Venue Change:At this point, I think they switched gears for a while from ""nightmare as cinema"" to ""first person shooter game as cinema"". Some of these games are also nightmarish in their design and action. They also have a compelling quality about them.The characters are alone in different scenes, running through empty corridors, making hairpin turns... all like the protagonist in a computer game, and the stuttering visuals (from Hud, the camera guy) resemble a game player trying to control his or her character with a joystick. And like a video game, we have the ""little"" monsters that pop up out of nowhere and attack. It's scary in video games, it was terrifying in this movie.Special Effects:I cannot imagine the huge amount of work it took to make this film. Granted much of it was CGI, and that in itself is a daunting task. The sets (especially the cockeyed building interiors) were obviously well conceived and executed. This was an expensive film to make and the set designers deserve credit for a very fine, and disturbing job - well done.The Ending - Discovering Ourselves:The idea of it being a nightmare in cinema film -- something never tried on this level before, I think -- not even ""Blair Witch"" holds a candle to it -- is further supported by the ending of the movie.The video camera keeps filming after the bridge collapses on the remaining characters and then goes black. Why?At this point, I realized that the audience is part of the film, just as we are part of our nightmares. WE ARE the camera! Like our ""eyes"" in a nightmare, we see through this device, and it is the one thing that cannot die. Obviously, we usually don't die in our nightmares. When a nightmare becomes too much, it all goes black and we wake up. When this movie became too much (all the characters were dead), it went black and we were left looking at the credits in total silence. Even the silent credits were disturbing and clever. Silence implies respect in many cases, such as at a funeral or in a library. Here, the film was silent, denoting how serious it was, the terror, the fear, the utter hopelessness... welcome to my nightmare, because when we awaken from a nightmare, we are there, in the silent darkness... alone with our fear.This film brought us to our fear and left us with it, just as a nightmare does.------------------------------Overall Rating:5 stars for a very good, very annoying, very unlikable, very disturbing, very clever, very compelling and very well done movie.Pros:Very innovative approach to the ""giant monster"" horror genre.Look at it as nightmare, release logic and reason, and it may work for you.Well crafted scenery and sets.Terrifying.Cons:Camera work was too disruptive and jiggly. They could have toned this down.-----------------------Conclusion:If you like nightmares, or are compelled by them, this film may grab you on that level and hold you there. Like nightmares, it is annoying, irritating, disturbing. Look at the film from this perspective and you may appreciate it.I have to say, it was a very clever approach and it worked for me.I'm sleeping with the lights on tonight!",5,The Secret of Cloverfield

659076,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JPXY,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","The basic ""plot"" of CLOVERFIELD is this. A group of twenty-something hip New Yorkers are having a going away party for one of their friends, Rob (Michael Stahl-David) who has received a big promotion at the company he works for and is moving to Japan. The party is going along relatively smoothly until Rob has a brief confrontation with his ex-girlfriend. Shortly after there is a massive explosion and the power goes out. No one knows what is happening and the party moves outside. The frivolity comes to an end when there's another explosion and the head of the Statue of Liberty falls from the sky and careens down the street. Mass hysteria ensues and chaos runs rampant. The core group of friends and a couple of tagalongs attempt to evacuate the city with thousands of other people until the bridge they are crossing is attacked by a giant creature that is just barely glimpsed on screen. The remaining friends want to evacuate, but Rob refuses to leave the city until he can make sure his ex-girlfriend has left her apartment. What follows is a quick and jerky romp through the tunnel system of the city, being chased by fleshing-eating miniature monsters, getting caught in the crossfire between the military and the monster, and just trying to stay alive. The tape being used to cover the event is interlaced with a few scenes here and there of Rob and his girlfriend from just weeks before when they were still a very happy couple.CLOVERFIELD has been described as a cross between a Godzilla movie and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Though that description isn't completely accurate, it does give a decent assessment of what the movie is like. The monster is never really seen until the end of the movie, but it does a huge amount of damage. The film is extremely shaky and when I first saw the movie several people were overheard complaining about the headache they had. Despite this, I really enjoyed the movie. It was something different and somewhat original and it makes me want to see more. It would be great if the studio did a follow up of the picture or published a book or something explaining where the monster came from and telling the story in a more linear, narrative fashion than the personal-point of view that CLOVERFIELD is. Most people either enjoy the movie or find it a complete waste of time; there are very few people who fall in the middle. If you don't mind shaky camera footage and are looking for a different kind of movie that tells an old-story, but from a newer perspective, give CLOVERFIELD a try. Also, in all honesty the DVD is probably the best way to watch the movie. Not only does it include the film, it's loaded with extras.",4,The End of the World As We Know It,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,2666,"['basic', 'plot', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'group', 'twenty-something', 'hip', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'are', 'having', 'going', 'away', 'party', 'one', 'friends', 'Rob', 'Michael', 'Stahl-David', 'who', 'received', 'big', 'promotion', 'company', 'moving', 'Japan', 'party', 'going', 'along', 'relatively', 'smoothly', 'Rob', 'brief', 'confrontation', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Shortly', 'massive', 'explosion', 'power', 'out', 'one', 'what', 'happening', 'party', 'moves', 'outside', 'frivolity', 'end', 'when', 'explosion', 'head', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'falls', 'sky', 'down', 'street', 'Mass', 'hysteria', 'ensues', 'chaos', 'runs', 'rampant', 'core', 'group', 'friends', 'couple', 'tagalongs', 'attempt', 'evacuate', 'city', 'thousands', 'other', 'people', 'bridge', 'are', 'crossing', 'attacked', 'giant', 'creature', 'just', 'barely', 'glimpsed', 'screen', 'remaining', 'friends', 'want', 'evacuate', 'Rob', 'leave', 'city', 'can', 'make', 'sure', 'ex-girlfriend', 'left', 'apartment', 'What', 'quick', 'jerky', 'romp', 'tunnel', 'system', 'city', 'being', 'chased', 'fleshing-eating', 'miniature', 'monsters', 'getting', 'caught', 'crossfire', 'military', 'monster', 'just', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'tape', 'being', 'used', 'cover', 'event', 'interlaced', 'few', 'scenes', 'here', 'there', 'Rob', 'girlfriend', 'just', 'weeks', 'when', 'were', 'still', 'very', 'happy', 'couple.CLOVERFIELD', 'been', 'described', 'cross', 'Godzilla', 'movie', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'description', ""n't"", 'completely', 'accurate', 'give', 'decent', 'assessment', 'what', 'movie', 'monster', 'never', 'really', 'seen', 'end', 'movie', 'huge', 'amount', 'damage', 'film', 'extremely', 'shaky', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'several', 'people', 'were', 'overheard', 'complaining', 'headache', 'had', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'something', 'different', 'somewhat', 'original', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'studio', 'did', 'follow', 'picture', 'published', 'book', 'something', 'explaining', 'where', 'monster', 'came', 'telling', 'story', 'more', 'linear', 'narrative', 'fashion', 'personal-point', 'view', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'Most', 'people', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'find', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'fall', 'middle', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'shaky', 'camera', 'footage', 'are', 'looking', 'different', 'kind', 'movie', 'old-story', 'newer', 'perspective', 'give', 'CLOVERFIELD', 'try', 'Also', 'honesty', 'DVD', 'probably', 'best', 'way', 'watch', 'movie', 'Not', 'only', 'include', 'film', 'loaded', 'extras']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

659078,AWRGM17GTMND8,B00005JPXY,"Tyler S. ""Super-Review""","[3, 3]","All the secrecy that went into the filmmaking of Cloverfield really paid off.  I went into the show with no knowledge of the plot, thanks to the eerie trailer, and wound up actually being excited during the viewing.  With all the spoilers in your face everywhere on the internet, it's hard to really be suprised anymore.  What movies like Cloverfield and The Dark Knight did, is they committed much of their time to protecting the material from being exposed.  When movies like X-men Origins: Wolverine are leaked, they lose their theater appreciation before they are released.  Cloverfield had to be one of the best big monster movies next to Peter Jackson's King Kong.  Its incredibly real and involving.  Those who are sensitive to shaky camera motions, may not appreciate it as much, but know that it is all for a sense of reality.  I couldn't bear to watch the Bourne movies because they were filmed poorly, but Cloverfield does ""shaky-cam"" right and respects the limits of my equilibrium and stomach.So after Cloverfield comes to Blu-ray, is it the same experience? No, but I still enjoy it and I see something new in it every time I view it.  It becomes on of those movies that you have to show people unaware of it.  The special features are ok.  I wanted the trailer on the disc as well as some more polished behind-the-scenes.  Star Trek had a much better disc delivery from J.J. Abrahms.  I'm upset to see the 3 star average review due to the pickiness of the cinematography.  I understand where you're coming from as long as you respect why it was made this particular way.  They didn't film it on a handycam to make it look cool.  They filmed it that way to make you feel a part of the show, and to make a monster movie as realistic as possible.  All the bumblings and jump cuts, just bring reality to the man behind the camera.  I think the shakiness only works in a film like this, where the one filming is a part of the cast.  What sense does it make to shake around the camera filming the Bourne Supremacy, when the view is the eye of God.  The one filming in those unnecessarily shaky movies is not a part of the cast.But anyway, I accept the mixed feelings people have for this movie.  I am one of the people who enjoyed it thoroughly in theaters and at home.  I am pushing a movement for directors and screenwriters to keep the entire production a secret while filming.  All these online set visits are going to destroy peoples experiences when the movie is released.  Films like ""The Dark Knight"", ""Cloverfield"", and ""Zombieland""(for its fantastic celebrity cameo) get so much credit for shocking audiences in their reveal.

659079,A3JLOIXFM75QNV,B00005JPXY,"Valerya Couto ""LOTRsherlockHPFreak""","[2, 3]","Cloverfield is more than a mediocre monster film. It is actually pretty darn good. Not great, but entertaining enough at 84 minutes to keep you interested from beginning to unconventional end, which is not something we usually see. I will not spoil anything, but this film is unlike most monster films. Besides the fact that there is a huge monster and it is attacking NYC and its people, the similarities stop there.There is no scientific mumbo jumbo, no real type of help, per se. There is just a small group of people and a video camera. We see what they see. Nothing more. It's pretty neat, and unlike the boring Blair Witch Project, actually effective, though I can imagine some people getting physically sick while watching this.The other thing I was surprised about was that we actually got to learn quite a bit about the few characters. You actually care what happens to them.The effects are pretty cool and the monster itself is quite interesting, especially the way it moves. Clearly alot of thought was put into the design.There is no musical score in the film, which actually makes it seem more believable and real.The film does have its flaws however. First, and most probably the biggest; it is not very scary, nor terribly suspenseful until about the last 10 minutes. Almost nothing is explained nor really resolved, but then again, we are only seeing what the characters see, nothing more, so I can't really fault that.I found it exciting and enjoyable and would love to see some kind of a sequel, which I think would benefit this film even more.The special features on the dvd are minute but kind of cool. Green Screen stuff, commentary. The alternate endings are almost undistinguishable from the original one, and not anything special.

It was a blast, the creature is pretty frightening and the parasites are disgusting.  J.J. Adams is a mastermind weaving intricate webs of secrets and playing with our imagination.  This film is beautiful and rich with shocking moments that are truly terrifying.  It's starts off confusing then it picks up the pace and never really slows down.  I have to warn people who will watch this with their kids especially little kids it will make them pee their pants.  In one part of the movie blood is introduced and it was extremely vulgar in it's delivery it was actually disturbing.

I don't think that's the case--if you watch the movie more than once.  I would consider the first viewing to be NUMBING.  I choose this word carefully.  The filmmakers are consciously referencing 9/11, and viewed through that lens, I found the plot to be representative of the human need to come to grips with that horrible event--the rescue narrative, which can be easily dismissed as romantic drivel, to me reads as the poetic expression of the human need to say the things that tragedy prevented us from saying.The complaints about the way the film is shot--with the handy cam--are valid and fair.  I was not bothered by them.Finally, I will say this for the film.  Yes, when I saw it in theaters, it felt uninvolving.  However, it was also haunting.  There was something about it that I felt compelled to come back to.  I have now seen it three times.  The more I see it, the more I see INTO it.

659086,A18758S1PUYIDT,B00005JPXY,Viva,"[4, 9]","SPOILERS!I was expecting a rampaging-monster flick where the creature eventually dies from something really simple, like water, or the bad taste of humans in its mouth.However, Cloverfield (where did that name originate, by the way?) has much more than a rampage going on.  There's a run for dear life, the willingness to go back for a beloved woman even though she might have been dead already, the grief for a fallen brother and a friend, and a relationship that endures to the bitter end.I was quite impressed by the way the special effects team made it look as if all of Manhattan was being destroyed; so much destruction on such a massive scale could not have been easy to simulate, even with green screen tech.  And that monster---it was much worse than the one in the far less superior movie The Mist.  Kudos to the monster designer as well.  The image of the camera operator being eaten was quite stunning.I have no problems with the handheld camera; it really didn't bother me on the small screen, though it might have on a larger one.  The movie does leave one with several unresolved issues to ponder, though:  Where did this monster come from?  Did someone create it in a lab or send it here from another planet?  Why didn't the military nuke the city to make sure it was gone for good?  Why did the bombs they dropped on it have no discernible effect?  What were those smaller creatures that emanated from its body?  Were the filmmakers making an allegory about terrorist attacks or random violence and evil that strikes the most innocent and unsuspecting people?Good for an hour or so of action and terror.",4,Better than I had anticipated,1208822400,"04 22, 2008",2008,1620,"['SPOILERS', 'was', 'expecting', 'rampaging-monster', 'flick', 'where', 'creature', 'eventually', 'something', 'really', 'simple', 'water', 'bad', 'taste', 'humans', 'mouth.However', 'Cloverfield', 'where', 'did', 'name', 'originate', 'way', 'much', 'more', 'rampage', 'going', 'run', 'dear', 'life', 'willingness', 'go', 'back', 'beloved', 'woman', 'even', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'dead', 'already', 'grief', 'fallen', 'brother', 'friend', 'relationship', 'bitter', 'end.I', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'way', 'special', 'effects', 'team', 'made', 'look', 'Manhattan', 'was', 'being', 'destroyed', 'so', 'much', 'destruction', 'massive', 'scale', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'simulate', 'even', 'green', 'screen', 'tech', 'monster', '-it', 'was', 'much', 'worse', 'one', 'far', 'less', 'superior', 'movie', 'Mist', 'Kudos', 'monster', 'designer', 'well', 'image', 'camera', 'operator', 'being', 'eaten', 'was', 'quite', 'stunning.I', 'have', 'problems', 'handheld', 'camera', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'small', 'screen', 'might', 'have', 'larger', 'one', 'movie', 'leave', 'one', 'several', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'ponder', 'Where', 'did', 'monster', 'come', 'Did', 'someone', 'create', 'lab', 'send', 'here', 'planet', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'military', 'nuke', 'city', 'make', 'sure', 'was', 'gone', 'good', 'Why', 'did', 'bombs', 'dropped', 'have', 'discernible', 'effect', 'What', 'were', 'smaller', 'creatures', 'emanated', 'body', 'Were', 'filmmakers', 'making', 'allegory', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'random', 'violence', 'evil', 'most', 'innocent', 'unsuspecting', 'people', 'Good', 'hour', 'so', 'action', 'terror']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release

Nothing in this film is unplanned or random, including the white noise, jump cuts, and frequent visual chaos3) I hope everyone saw the ""thing"" splash into the sea during the last flashback; the characters are so self-involved they don't even notice.4)The whole film is greater than the sum of its parts and hits hard at a lot of contemporary culture and the modern mind-set. It's not about 9-11, it's about the national head-state.5) Watch this with Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" and the first half hour of ""Saving Private Ryan""--don't forget to watch Forbidden Planet too.

""Cloverfield"" is the b monster movie for modern times. Use the technique of ""Blair Witch"", throw in a dash of ""Alien"" and a big heaping footprint of ""Godzilla"" and you've got ""Cloverfield"" which clocks in at a brief but intense 84 minutes. J.J. Abrams and his collaborators writer Drew Goodard (a writing alum of Abrams' ""Lost"" and ""Alias"") & Matt Reeves (another long time Abrams collegue who also shot ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" as well as episodes of ""Lost"")put together a wild ride of a monster movie recalling ""It Came from Beneath the Sea"" and, more importantly, ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"" with its focus on a famous city terrorized by a larger than life creature.WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW!The film is told from the point of view of Hud who is documenting his best friend Rob's going away party. It seems that Rob is the new VP for a company in Japan and the big celebration put on by his brother Jason and his girlfriend. Rob has a blow out with best friend and long-time crush Lei. Then all heck breaks loose as the Creature begins tearing apart Manhattan and bowling with the head of the Statue of Liberty.END OF SPOILERS:""Cloverfield"" looks quite good on DVD. While this single disc edition doesn't have as many extras as I had expected (Best Buy has a bonus disc with a 24 minute behind-the-scenes featurette composed of, naturally enough, camcorder footage!). We get an audio commentary track from the director (he discusses how Abrams was inspired to create ""Cloverfield"" after going to Japan and seeing a store full of Godzilla toys. He though we deserved our own giant lizard, too), outtakes, deleted scenes, a pair of not-so-different alternate endings AND an amusing Easter Egg.""Cloverfield"" isn't a deep film and isn't meant to be. While it does make reference to 9/11 because of the stark images of destruction and our knowledge of that event (as well as the characters reaction to what is occuring around them), ""Cloverfield"" doesn't take that analogy too seriously instead focusing on scaring and startling us. Still, the Creature as terrorist (when is a terrorist NOT a monster?)provides us a window into a world rocked by destruction and a glimpse into the sometimes brave sometimes idiotic reaction of human beings in a crisis situation.The characters are pretty well drawn considering that our only knowledge of them comes from what we see via the camcorder (including footage that survived being taped over--a very clever way to give us a backstory on the main couple)but the technique means that there are limitations--we know only what the group of characters we are stuck with know becoming part of their group via the camcorder and Hud's occasionally insightful and idiotic musings.""Cloverfield"" will never be ""The Godfather"" but it's a very good film within a genre that has varied from the idiotic (""The Giant Gila Monster"") to the exceptional (pick any of the ground breaking monster-on-the-loose movies you'd like)and it is an enjoyable ride. If it is the cinematic version of junk food, it's extremely tasty and enjoyable junk food. Could it have been improved? Sure--we could have had better acting, character development, background which the director could have introduced in the same format as the other stuff but for its limited scope and ambitions its a fine film (that's even comparing it to Abrams' other film projects from ""Regarding Henry"" to ""MI:3"" or ""Lost"").""Cloverfield"" takes the film as amusement park ride one step further than many others have with its jittery camera work and ""you are there"" approach to documenting the destruction of ""Manhattan"".

659092,ARWCFLO1Q0XY9,B00005JPXY,W. Foley,"[1, 9]","I grew up on Godzilla movies of the 60s and 70s and I have always enjoyed movies like this. I was also someone who followed Cloverfield's viral marketing campaign being caught up in the excitement which the first teaser trailer delivered. Although I have a few complaints about a couple aspects of the movie; for me the movie more than lived up to the hype and JJ Abrams and Matt Reeves delivered a movie that was a terrifying thrill ride.I understand that the way the movie was filmed was a deal breaker for some people. For me there were times when I did think the shakiness was a bit too much but for the majority of the film the camera technique faded into the background and I was able to enjoy the movie. Being a lover of giant creature features the other slight disappointment was in the length of time the monster was seen in the movie. I say it's a slight disappointment because I do think that seeing only glimpses of the monster throughout the movie did help create that sense of fear of the unknown and the suspense of what may happen at any minute. But I don't think showing the monster a little more than they did would not have hurt. Also a consolation is the fact that creature designer Neville Paige designed a giant monster that was frightening, very original and innovative.Much has been said about the plot so I will not rehash it here. I did like the acting and the time in the beginning of the movie getting to know our characters was well spent. For me they were characters which I grew to care about. TJ Miller's character of Hud and his unrequited crush on Marlena provides for some humorous moments of comic relief throughout the film. But the main relationship driving the plot of the movie is Rob who finds the courage to face a monster head on in his pursuit to rescue Beth the girl he's afraid to commit to.

Dwinnell IV,"[4, 6]","The premise and plot of this movie are really surprisingly simple: think of a Godzilla movie from the human victims' point of view, and set it in New York.  This movie avoids many common Hollywood disorders:  There are no big name actors.  Special effects are used appropriately.  The ""camcorder perspective"" generates a very genuine, intimate feel.  The main characters (just average people) do not pick up over-sized weapons and take on the ""monster"".  There is no pointless over-explanation about what attacked the city.In short, I found this movie to be good fun.  Along with the suspense and action one would expect from this sort of film, characters were developed enough for them to have believable motivations and for the audience to care.Many have complained that there was too much camera shake in this film.  Though I thought it was over-done, I am quite surprised by claims that people have become nauseated watching this movie.

659097,A3DJXS3PFBB48P,B00005JPXY,Woodlandtrails,"[2, 4]","Warning - Movie spoilersCloverfield's special effects were very good.  Many scenes most definitely got the viewer's blood pumping in fear such as the subway attack and when those things jumped off the monster and attacked a man while soldiers were fighting in the street.  There were many truly frightening episodes throughout this film.  The bouncing camera recording made it realistic as it reflected exactly what was occurring around the man holding it.  But, this film squandered so much potential.The first 19 minutes were incredibly boring spent by Rob's best friend Hudson video recording people at Rob's going away to Japan party saying goodbye. Among the party attendees were Rob's ex-girlfriend Beth at the party with a new boyfriend, Jason (Rob's brother), Lily (Jason's girlfriend) and Marlena (Rob's acquaintance).  Then Beth gets embarrassed and leaves Rob's party because Lily blabs that Beth slept with Rob to Hudson who blabbed it to everyone he filmed.  Lily should have known better then to tell Hudson as Hudson was such an obvious big kid.  Karma gets Hudson but he didn't deserve it nearly as much as the 2 stars of this film.The contrast of the movie is supposed to be between a happy Coney Island Rob/Beth trip being taped over by the unfolding horror of monsters attacking New York.  The real contrast turns out to be between wimpy Beth against the the growing courage of Lily and Hudson and Marlena who kicked monster booty saving each other with Marlena saving Hudson and getting severely injured and later dying in the process.  Two brave young people die trying to rescue one unworthy Beth. Another contrast was between Jason (strong) and his brother Rob (weak and rightfully called a douche bag by his own brother).  The adage the ""good die young""  inversely means the not so good live and this was very apparent in Cloverfield.Cloverfield's plot called for Rob to be the knight in shining armor and to rescue the helpless damsel Beth in distress regardless who dies doing it.  Laughably, she is actually found laying on her back with her eyes closed like Cinderella with clean fresh hair spread around her head in an enticing manner.  Amazingly all that thick 9-11 dust floating around from downed/damaged buildings never graced her body.  Even more laughable, Beth alternatively feigns between leaning on Rob to walk to running like a sprinter. The movie tries to have it both ways but the same adrenaline that got her running like a sprinter and lifting heavy debris off Rob after the helicopter crash SHOULD have gotten her up off that apartment floor and that single rod though a shoulder and outside to find safety by herself.Initially after the monster attacks, Lily and Marlena act like flighty airheads ineptly running in high heels incapable of making a rational decision in an dire situation. Rob acts like a complete airhead feeling guilty because Beth is not with him and endangers the whole group going after her after Beth calls him to come get her because she ""can't move"". Turns out Beth was NOT hurt so bad that she could NOT have pulled herself off that thin rod which was only though a shoulder and not a vital organ and walk down those stairs to meet Rob/group of friends SOMEWHERE safer than Beth's dangerous apartment.  Beth certainly had no problem running down 57 flights of stairs after Rob and the rest came for her despite her ""injury"" and running like the wind when they got outside.When Rob/Beth/Hudson took off in a military helicopter there were at least 2 soldiers possibly more with them.  When it crashes, these 2 losers (Rob/Beth) never checked to see if any military personnel were still alive after calling out and finding each other because this film is all about them.  While Hudson acted childish initially, he was was growing up fast and realizing a budding relationship with Marlena as she admires his courage and he hers but alas both die horribly in an effort to save Beth.  Hudson and Marlena could have been evacuated at the beginning of the film or walked out another way after the bridge collapsed.  Hudson could also have been evacuated at the soldier's camp where Marlena died but he didn't want to let his best friend Rob down and continued to follow him.The plot could have been so much better if it showed the strengths of all the characters.  Beth could have called Rob and they all agreed to meet somewhere in the middle.  The film could have shown the courage of Beth getting off her butt out of that building and the hardships both groups endured making their way to this middle ground. This film squandered lives to save one undeserving one.  What a sad film when viewers find more interest/hope in the relationships between the fast maturing Hudson's budding romance with Marlena and the relationship between Jason/Lily than they are in the fake Rob/Beth.A fitting ending for the in love selfish Rob and Beth who caused their friends to die and who cared about no one but themselves.  ""After the credits a brief radio call is heard, saying ""Help us"" (meaning Rob/Beth). If played backwards, the audio states ""Its still alive"".  If karma is real, no one will rescue Beth a second time and the Hammerdown Protocol involved nuclear bombs so it won't matter if these 2 losers get out or not because the radiation will get them.",2,Two Completely Unsympathic Lovers,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,5313,"['Warning', 'Movie', 'spoilersCloverfield', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'Many', 'scenes', 'most',

659098,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B00005JPXY,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[3, 7]","When one thinks of ""Cloverfield"" the awesome ""hyped-up"" trailer comes to mind. The teaser trailer was very well-marketed and does grab our attention. J.J. Abrams (Mission Impossible, Lost)definitely knows how to arouse the curiosity and attention of moviegoers. Now, the only problem with hyping up a film so much is that it either works or it doesn't. Hype can definitely work in putting people on theater seats but once word gets out that the film is ""anything but..."". Well, again, kudos to the producers who thought of the gimmick.The film's premise is looked at from the scope of POV of a DV camera during the farewell party for one bound for Japan executive Rob (Michael Stahl David). Suddenly, an unknown force rocks Manhattan. Wild fear and panic ensues as the military attempts to stop the gigantic menace on its path of destruction. Rob and a group of partygoers attempt to navigate through the city to save Rob's one true love; Beth. They find little hope as the rampage of the ""unknown"" force blocks all exits.""Blair Witch Project"" anyone? Yes, the film takes on the camera style of the hugely successful horror film. Director Matt Reeves uses a single DV camera to take the audience into the heart of a monster film. Cloverfield is an ambitious film, it tries to escape from the usual clich&eacute;s and stereotypes that have plagued monster films before. Sadly, while the style did work for ""Blair Witch"", this film came off a little short. I do commend the producers for trying to widen the scope of a very limited premise in resorting to the video camera to emulate raw panic and fear. What made ""Blair Witch"" stand out was its ability to delve into the emotion of the unknown and the unexplained. ""The Mist"" already explored the unknown and while the ""Cloverfield"" does have a lot of emotions involved in the proceedings, I tend to look at things a bit differently. The gigantic monster is shown from time to time through the camera, and frankly it looks like the monster came from ""The Mist"". Even the once-again, spider-like creatures looked like they came from the aforementioned film by Frank Darabont.""Cloverfield"" does attempt something different, the routes it took seem so ineffective. The film tries to give the viewer the feeling of REALITY through the video camera, but somehow, it fumbles its premise halfway through. It still fell to the usual clich&eacute;s inherent in a sci-fi monster film: display of military might, evacuation and panic, a love-sick hero with unexpressed love, dwindling hope, death and destruction, the usual heroics. The film employs obvious editing tricks to attempt to give the backstory of Beth and Rob's romance with the camera acting screwy that it rewinds from time to time. The film tries its best to make something so groundbreaking with a monster premise and while its producers/directors' hearts are in the correct place, the film's execution becomes nauseating. Quite frankly, the DV camera feels more like a ""GIMMICK"" than a REAL INHERENT part of the film. In ""Blair Witch"", at least, the characters are lost in the woods and they wish that a DV camera may give some light to what happens to them, which makes the video camera relevant.After all, who can hold a camera while your friends are being attacked? Why pick up the camera again after you drop it after you get attacked? (A metal bar would be more viable) Why hold on to the camera when you are scaling a tipped over rooftop? What kind of MORONIC stupidity is it for someone to keep on recording what is happening under the shadow of raw panic and hysteria? What kind of insensitivity is it to keep a dumb camera in play in the face of your friends' suffering? In REALITY, time is of the essence and the survival of your friends are the most important. REALITY dictates the video camera to be thrown aside for survival. After all is said and done, in this situation, the video camera is a useless piece of recording; for in REALITY, the whole world would know when a 200+ ft. monster is attacking a city. The camera needed to be turned off!To its credit, at the very least, there are some intense and scary moments in the film that are reminiscent of classic invasion films. The special effects are nicely done and the movie is indeed loud. The explosions are felt and pure destruction does save parts of the film. There is also some blood and gore. (although some of it happens off camera) I sure wished that the military encounters with the giant creature and the spider things were more explored. Actually, it would have done well if it was a reporter's first-person perspective who captured the footage of a heated encounter. Unfortunately, the director depends on crude humor and serious attempts at a sob story to generate sympathy. The film requires a large suspension of disbelief that contradicts its atmosphere to emulate a feeling of reality.Ultimately, ""Cloverfield"" could have survived without the single video camera gimmick. It could have just stuck to the basics of a monster film and still turned in a generous box-office take. Its attempts to emulate ""REALITY"" in the first person view may be its strength but its execution is also its greatest weakness. The pure ""gimmick"" of a single video camera tries to give the viewer a first-person view and/or spectator's point of view is an attempt to hide the hollow plot that it could have just as well be a spin-off of the far superior film; ""The Mist"". If you think about it, ""Cloverfield"" is what is happening in New York when ""The Mist"" took place in that small town. I am certain that this film will have its following who will say there is a deeper context and hidden subtle details where there is none. It does have the message of ""seizing the moment"", life is short, and love is powerful.But the next time someone says it is so original and groundbreaking, ask yourself this: How would I feel if a friend kept running around shooting a camera while we're running for our lives? Just enjoy it for what it is, a typical monster flick and it happens in New York again.In truth, The Korean hit monster-family film; ""The Host"" and Darabont's ""The Mist"" is a lot better. Heck, at least, ""Cloverfield"" was better than the U.S. made ""Godzilla"" movie....It's ok, nothing spectacular but will definitely appeal to some.

659100,AP3B615GM191G,B00005JPXY,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[6, 8]","Have you ever wondered what would happen if a Godzilla-like creature suddenly ran rampant through the streets of New York?  If you have, then you will enjoy ""Cloverfield"", as it ponders that ultimate ""what if?"" and puts you right in the middle of it.For a basic plot summary, ""Cloverfield"" begins with a bunch of young New Yorkers throwing a going-away party for one of their own.  From their high-rise on that very night, however, they witness a terrifying creature wreaking havoc on Manhattan Island.  When one of them becomes trapped at the scene and needs assistance, the film turns into a quest to retrieve her, all the while documenting the brutal attack.""Cloverfield"" is a very polarizing film, to say the least (just look at the number of 1-star reviews here).  Many don't like the handheld camera (""jittery"") format or the sometimes-inane commentary by the camera-holder.  For me, however, I was completely blown away by the ""now""-ness of this movie.  I'll explain...Basically, there is very little ""setup"" to this movie.  Besides a touch of character development in the film's opening minutes that is important towards understanding the events that transpire later, there are no boundaries or preconceived notions.  You will feel as if you are right there with the main characters as they try to navigate the crumbled streets of NYC, every once in awhile getting a glimpse of the hideous beast.  That is exactly why ""Cloverfield"" succeeds as well as it does.  Mastermind filmmaker JJ Abrams (a producer on this one) realizes that just SHOWING a monster movie wouldn't be enough.  Instead, he IMMERSES viewers in the entire experience from beginning to end.Thus, in terms of science fiction, I consider this to be one of my favorite little films of all-time.  Because of the first-person nature and ""things-are-happening-right-now"" pace of the movie, there was never a dull moment.  I also found myself completely sucked in by first the mystery, and then the hideous of the attacking creature.  I highly recommend this flick to anyone looking for something different...but also spectacular.",5,What If?,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,2099,"['Have', 'ever', 'wondered', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Godzilla-like', 'creature', 'suddenly', 'ran', 'rampant', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'have', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Cloverfield', 'ultimate', 'what', 'right', 'middle', 'it.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Cloverfield', 'bunch', 'young', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'throwing', 'going-away', 'party', 'one', 'own', 'high-rise', 'very', 'night', 'however', 'witness', 'terrifying', 'creature', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'Manhattan', 'Island', 'When', 'one', 'trapped', 'scene', 'assistance', 'film', 'quest', 'retrieve', 'while', 'documenting', 'brutal', 'attack', 'Cloverfield', 'very', 'polarizing', 'film', 'say', 'least', 'just', 'look', 'number', '1-star', 'reviews', 'here', 'Many', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'handheld', 'camera', 'jittery', 'format', 'sometimes-inane', 'commentary', 'camera-holder', 'however', 'was', 'completely', 'blown', 'away', 'now', '-ness', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'Basically', 'very', 'little', 'setup', 'movie', 'touch', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'opening', 'minutes', 'important', 'towards', 'understanding', 'events', 'transpire', 'later', 'are', 'boundaries', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'will', 'feel', 'are', 'right', 'there', 'main', 'characters', 'try', 'navigate', 'crumbled', 'streets', 'NYC', 'once', 'awhile', 'getting', 'glimpse', 'hideous', 'beast', 'exactly', 'why', 'Cloverfield', 'as', 'well', 'Mastermind', 'filmmaker', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'producer', 'one', 'just', 'SHOWING', 'monster', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'enough', 'Instead', 'viewers', 'entire', 'experience', 'beginning', 'end.Thus', 'terms', 'science', 'fiction', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'little', 'films', 'all-time', 'first-person', 'nature', 'things-are-happening-right-now', 'pace', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'also', 'found', 'completely', 'sucked', 'first', 'mystery', 'then', 'hideous', 'attacking', 'creature', 'highly', 'recommend', 'flick', 'anyone', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'also', 'spectacular']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release
659101,A145CT70T2SB51,B00005JPXY,Zekeriyah,"[8, 12]","I don't know if thats a good or a bad thing for you, but I liked the movie. I suppose it depends on personal taste more than anything else though. I do tend to like giant monster movies, so I finally wound up breaking down and buying this movie after I saw it listed under my recommendations here on Amazon.com. I was not disappointed.So what is it? Thats the million dollar question, isn't it? The movie starts out as a group of friends throw a party for Rob, who is going away to Japan (nice nod to the country that gave us Godzilla, Gamera and Ultraman, amongst others). About twenty minutes into the film, some THING happens and from that point on it becomes about trying to escape New York city while a giant monster runs amok. Hudd, one of the main characters, decides to document the whole thing on the camcorder, which winds up getting spliced in with the existing material on the tape. The end result is pretty interesting... sort of the natural progression from the 'Blair Witch Project,' except with a little (or maybe alot) more meat on it's bones. The ending was great too... I'm not going to spoil it anymore than that, but I liked it.The story is very well done, I thought, focusing as much on the fact that theres a huge prehistoric monster rampaging through the streets of New York as it does on the characters, their relationships and their attempts to flee the city to safety. Despite what some people have said, we do get more than a few glimpses of the monster - in fact, it looks sort of like.. oh, I don't know, a multi-limbed reptilian-ape hybrid - but it is left mysterious. Nothing is really ever explained about the monster. Did it come up from the deep? Is it from outerspace? Was it a government experiment? Thats up to the viewers to decide. The makers of the film made a brilliant move in doing so, because keeping us in the dark makes the monster much more scary and unknown. And infinitely cooler in my opinion. However one clue MIGHT be seen off in the distance if you look very closely at the end.Now, as for the special features, they were okay but not great. The deleted scenes, outtakes and two alternate endings were interesting, though they didn't add much. And I prefer the ending they went with over either of the slight variations. The other special features, like the making of and especially the little featurette about the monster... those were much better. It was especially neat to go back and watch the movie after learning some of the details about the monster, because it made the beast's actions that much more interesting. And, it also made you feel more sympathetic for the creature too. But I won't say much beyond that.Over all, it was a great movie. The pacing of the action was very good, the monster was awesome (which you need for a movie like this), and the storyline, while similar to other giant monster flicks, was given a unique new spin. Quite innovative. The character of Hudd made an enjoyable, even sympathetic, narrator, and the woman playing Marlena (his crush) did a fun job in her role too. And it really winds up feeling like its an amateur blogger doing a home movie documenting some huge world-changing event. So kudos to the makers of Cloverfield. It REALLY is a cool new twist on giant monster movies, and worth seeing a couple times to take in everything. I liked it and strongly recommend it.",5,Not Your Typical Giant Monster Movie,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,3372,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'thats', 'good', 'bad', 'thing', 'liked', 'movie', 'suppose', 'personal', 'taste', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'do', 'tend', 'like', 'giant', 'monster', 'movies', 'so', 'finally', 'wound', 'up', 'breaking', 'down', 'buying', 'movie', 'saw', 'listed', 'recommendations', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.So', 'what', 'million', 'dollar', 'question', ""n't"", 'movie', 'out', 'group', 'friends', 'throw', 'party', 'Rob', 'who', 'going', 'away', 'Japan', 'nice', 'nod', 'country', 'gave', 'Godzilla', 'Gamera', 'Ultraman', 'others', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'THING', 'happens', 'point', 'trying', 'escape', 'New', 'York', 'city', 'giant', 'monster', 'amok', 'Hudd', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'decides', 'document', 'whole', 'thing', 'camcorder', 'up', 'getting', 'spliced', 'existing', 'material', 'tape', 'end', 'result', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'sort', 'natural', 'progression', ""'Blair"", 'Witch', 'Project', 'little', 'maybe', 'alot', 'more', 'meat', 'bones', 'ending', 'was', 'great', 'too', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'anymore', 'liked', 'it.The', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'thought', 'focusing', 'as', 'much', 'fact', 'huge', 'prehistoric', 'monster', 'rampaging', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'characters', 'relationships', 'attempts', 'flee', 'city', 'safety', 'what', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'do', 'get', 'more', 'few', 'glimpses', 'monster', 'fact', 'sort', 'like..', 'oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'multi-limbed', 'reptilian-ape', 'hybrid', 'left', 'mysterious', 'Nothing', 'really', 'ever', 'explained', 'monster', 'Did', 'come', 'up', 'deep', 'outerspace', 'Was', 'government', 'experiment', 'viewers', 'decide', 'makers', 'film', 'made', 'brilliant', 'move', 'doing', 'so', 'keeping', 'dark', 'monster', 'much', 'more', 'scary', 'unknown', 'infinitely', 'cooler', 'opinion', 'However', 'one', 'clue', 'MIGHT', 'be', 'seen', 'off', 'distance', 'look', 'very', 'closely', 'end.Now', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'okay', 'not', 'great', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'two', 'alternate', 'endings', 'were', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'prefer', 'ending', 'went', 'slight', 'variations', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'making', 'especially', 'little', 'featurette', 'monster', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'especially', 'neat', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'movie', 'learning', 'details', 'monster', 'made', 'beast', 'actions', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'also', 'made', 'feel', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'creature', 'too', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'pacing', 'action', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'monster', 'was', 'awesome', 'need', 'movie', 'storyline', 'similar', 'other', 'giant', 'monster', 'flicks', 'was', 'given', 'unique', 'new', 'spin', 'Quite', 'innovative', 'character', 'Hudd', 'made', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'sympathetic', 'narrator', 'woman', 'playing', 'Marlena', 'crush', 'did', 'fun', 'job', 'role', 'too', 'really', 'up', 'feeling', 'amateur', 'blogger', 'doing', 'home', 'movie', 'documenting', 'huge', 'world-changing', 'event', 'So', 'kudos', 'makers', 'Cloverfield', 'REALLY', 'cool', 'new', 'twist', 'giant', 'monster', 'movies', 'worth', 'seeing', 'couple', 'times', 'take', 'everything', 'liked', 'strongly', 'recommend']",Cloverfield Theatrical Release
