Yep!Though Andrea Corr's acting was pretty mediocre and some of the scenes were cheesy and predictable, I actually really enjoyed this movie. I'm a huge fan of Irish music, Irish culture, Irish movies, and just the country of Ireland in general, so movies like this are generally right up my alley (""Waking Ned Devine"" is one of my all-time favorite movies, for example). This is a cute, lighthearted, feel-good type of film. That's the kind of movie I'm usually in the mood for and this one didn't disappoint.Like I said before, some of the scenes are corny and some of the acting, in my opinion, is a little questionable at times.

THE BOYS AND GIRL FROM COUNTY CLARE  hits that description on target.  This is an emerald of a jaunty little Irish tale that thoroughly entertains with a fine cast and superb Irish music and leaves the audience wholly satisfied - AND has a fine social comment!The setting is County Clare where the International Irish Music festival is at hand.  For years John-Joe McMahon (Bernard Hill) and his little band have won the ceili (Irish dance music) band competition.  Members of his hometown orchestra include young Anne (Andrea Corr) and her unmarried grumpy piano-playing mother Maisie (Charlotte Bradley).  Word comes round that John-Joe's long estranged brother Jimmy (Colm Meaney) has a band from Liverpool, a band that includes Liverpudlian types including young and handsome flautist Teddy (Shaun Evans) and is aimed in the direction of the Festival to compete.  In fine Irish tradition the two mutually angry brothers try to sabotage each other's appearance, but alas they both come face to face in the competition.  With Jimmy's arrival we discover that Maisie's negative outlook comes from the fact that Jimmy is the one who wantonly got her pregnant and Anne is Jimmy's daughter.  Maisie is forced to admit to Anne her betrayal of ancestry news and the mother/daughter relationship is strained to the breaking point.Anne and Teddy (naturally) fall for each other and the two of them decide to return to Liverpool after the festival ends with neither's band the winner.  This development is threatening to Maisie and she finally confronts Jimmy with her pent up resentment and disappointment.  How the young ones cope with their situation and emotions and resolve the problem of distance is the finale of this sweet story and is best left to the viewer to discover.The acting is homogeneously fine with the comedy and drama in fine balance.  And oh the music!  Director John Irvin has created a little jewel of a film that warms the proverbial cockles of your heart.

The usual tale of rivalry, lost love and perhaps new found love is laid out in whimsical fashion, and the music is superb.

I've always enjoyed Irish music, but until watching this film, I had never heard of a ceili band.  Now I'll be on the lookout for a CD or two.Oh yeah, the brother against brother thing?  It's a conflict that's contested through music, in this case the annual Ceili Band Contest.  Two brothers, John Joe, the older one stayed on the farm in Ireland, while Jimmy left for Liverpool shortly after getting his girlfriend pregnant.  After 26 years of estrangement, Jimmy returns to the ceili competition with his band, hoping to interrupt the two year championship reign of John Joe's band.  Avoiding the fray thus far is a third brother Padjo, a missionary priest off in Africa.  At least we think Padjo has been avoiding the fray.John Joe (Bernard Hill from the Lord of the Rings series) is a man at peace with himself and his music, although not so much at peace that he can't respond to the imminent arrival of his sibling's band with a delaying dirty trick or two.  His band includes the scorned girlfriend of his brother, Maisie, and her daughter, Ann (luminously played by Andrea Corr of The Corrs musical group).Jimmy (Colm Meaney from The Commitments and The Snapper, two other excellent Irish movies) has led a materially prosperous life in Liverpool that's been somewhat emotionally bereft; as evidenced by his testy attitude and his multiple ex-wives.  His band features a mix of old pro musicians along with some young talent that provokes his ire with an occasional foray into jazz.The bands serve as musical Montagues and Capulets, as Ann meets and falls in love with Teddy (Shaun Evans).  Ann has never met her father, and Maisie would have never come to the competition had she known that Jimmy would be there.Well then, brotherly conflict, an embittered fallen woman of a certain age, a young woman conflicted about the father she never knew, and young lovers from different factions of a competition... is that enough to keep your interest?To be honest though, you could almost ignore the successful efforts of a marvelous cast and a great story that is well told, because the music is fantastic!

This is a very funny and entertainingly romantic story of two feuding brothers (Colm Meany and Bernard Hill) who challenge each other through their bands, one of which consists of a woman Maisie (Charlotte Bradley) whom Jimmy (Meany) had gotten pregnant and left behind years ago and the daughter he at first doesn't know is his(Andrea Corr).Meanwhile, young love is blooming between Anne (Corr), and the flute player from her father's band, Teddy (Shaun Evans).  This movie is absolute fun from start to finish, full of great jokes, wonderful Irish music, and the lovely, picturesque scenery of Northern Ireland.  The conflicts of this movie are worked out with tact and no syrupy goo like so many other romantic comedies, which guys will appreciate, to which I must also add that this is NOT a chick flick!  It's a good time for one and all.  Congratulations to Andrea Corr for finally landing her largest role in a movie yet, and I hope to see her land even bigger parts in the future.***That reminds me, why is the lady from Canada's review posted up here twice?  I would not have noticed if she hadn't made such a point of being so mean to Andrea!***",4,Andrea Corr and Irish Culture Fans Are In for a Treat.,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,1368,"['Ever', 'heard', 'Ceili', 'band', 'competition', 'Well', 'check', 'movie', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'excellent', 'Irish', 'music', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'may', 'make', 'fan', 'genre', 'already', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'entertainingly', 'romantic', 'story', 'two', 'feuding', 'brothers', 'Colm', 'Meany', 'Bernard', 'Hill', 'who', 'challenge', 'other', 'bands', 'one', 'woman', 'Maisie', 'Charlotte', 'Bradley', 'whom', 'Jimmy', 'Meany', 'had', 'gotten', 'pregnant', 'left', 'behind', 'years', 'ago', 'daughter', 'first', ""n't"", 'know', 'Andrea', 'Corr', '.Meanwhile', 'young', 'love', 'blooming', 'Anne', 'Corr', 'flute', 'player', 'father', 'band', 'Teddy', 'Shaun', 'Evans', 'movie', 'absolute', 'fun', 'start', 'finish', 'full', 'great', 'jokes', 'wonderful', 'Irish', 'music', 'lovely', 'picturesque', 'scenery', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'conflicts', 'movie', 'are', 'worked', 'out', 'tact', 'syrupy', 'goo', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'guys', 'will', 'appreciate', 'must', 'also', 'add', 'NOT', 'chick', 'flick', 'good', 'time', 'one', 'Congratulations', 'Andrea', 'Corr', 'finally', 'landing', 'largest', 'role', 'movie', 'yet', 'hope', 'see', 'land', 'even', 'bigger', 'parts', 'future', '***That', 'why', 'lady', 'Canada', 'review', 'posted', 'up', 'here', 'twice', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'noticed', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'point', 'being', 'so', 'mean', 'Andrea', '***']",N/A

Kyle,"[8, 8]","The Aran Ceilidh Band Competition draws bands from all over Ireland, and in this case, Liverpool, to compete for the Ceilidh band trophy.For the first time, Liverpudlian Jimmy McMahon (Meany) is entering a band for the competition.  He knows he's up against his older brother John Joe (Hill).  Bribing a Customs official and stealing the wheels off one of their buses is just the beginning of what the two brothers will do to beat each other.  It's not just this contest, but rivalry from many years ago that propels their antagonism.My husband and I watched this movie once this afternoon and turned around to see it again. It's funny, the music and scenary are gorgeous, and it's just well done all the way around.

The leading contender to dethrone the band is a band from Liverpool lead by Bernard's younger successful brother Jimmy played by Colm Meany who hasn't seen or heard from John Joe for over 20 years.The two feuding brothers seem to stop at nothing to prevent the other band from registering in the contest. While at the contest Anne falls for flute player Teddy-played by Shaun Evans who is also the rival band's best player.
