The setting is a 8th AAF Bomb Group in the ETO (European Theater of Operation). Cast includes a young Robert Wagner as Ed Boland (BO) and Steve McQueen as ""Buzz"" Rickson. Two different personalities sharing the same Woman. Bo is the ""by the book"" Co Pilot but everybodys friend. Buzz is more realistic and callous about his job. Bo views the War as an inconvience a disruption in his life. Buzz lives for War and states he'd be there till the last bomb drops. The woman they share is the lovely and sophisticated Shirley Anne Field as Daphne. All WWII Aviation buffs will like the interior shots of the B-17. Of interests is also the Briefing room and Pre-flight sequences. The Flight Gear is also of interest to WWII buffs. As my Title states this was filmed in the Golden Era of Aviation Films.

The good shots of the airfield, the bomber, its different crew stations like the tail guns and the ball turret, and crew roles are all first class.  You feel the cold, the claustrophobia, the bulky gear, and how ""doing things by the numbers"" could be the difference between life and death.Different viewers may have different reactions to the portrait of B-17 pilot ""Buzz Rickson"" in this film adapted from the novel by John Hersey, but my guess is most will agree that Steve McQueen gave a masterful performance.

746902,AU7MW8YQQYHXX,B00008R9M6,"John A. Van Devender ""Gadfly""","[7, 8]","Steve McQueen does his best to bristle up his character in this movie.  The basic theme is solid and perhaps its defects are only apparent to military (or ex-) aviators.The plot would have been better cast in a fighter squadron rather than with B-17's.  The beauty of those big birds and the excellent images of them flying goes a long way toward carrying the movie.  It is just plain difficult however to portray McQueen as a ""hot shot"" when the mission generally doesn't offer much opportunity for it.  McQueen is restricted to disobeying orders in order to sneak below and overcast and drop his bombs anyway (something that would have given the AA gunners a field day) and buzzing the tower (admittedly a beautiful thing to see).McQueen is thus relegated to emoting his role and that is not his forte.  He does a good job though and except for a bit of brittleness toward the end he carries it off well.  What he does very well is portray the essential loneliness of a man whose self-identity must continually be proven, both to the world and to himself.  The ""warrior"" self can only be fulfilled in war - something that George Scott famously portrayed in that scene from ""Patton"" - when,upon surveying the hideous reality of a battle field, said ""God help me, I love it.""

746904,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B00008R9M6,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I liked this 1962 British black and white war film, in which we can see as main stars two A-list American actors of the 60s - which kind of makes sense as they both play Americans... Below, more of my impressions, with some spoilers.Great Britain, 1943. Captain Buzz Rickson (Steve McQueen), an American pilot flying a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber nicknamed &#34;The Body&#34; is being watched with a growing concern by his superiors - and ultimately also by his co-pliot, Lieutenant Ed Bollander (Robert Wagner). Rickson is an incredibly gifted pilot, an absolutley fearless man and also a suprisingly charsimatic war time leader - but he is also prone to most serious insubordination and mind defying crazy stunts... The flight surgeon who observed him for some time is uncertain whether Rickson is a hero or a psychopath - but hints at the possibility of both those things being true...Things will ultimately start to go REALLY south when Bollander starts to meet regularly with a young British woman, Daphne (Shirley Ann Field, adorable). Daphne lost her British fianc&eacute;e already some time ago and tries to move on by engaging into a &#34;no strings attached&#34; war time romance with the young and dashing American officer - but it turns out it is not that simple and the whole thing mey get more serious with time... For some reason, this enrages Rickson, although he certainly doesn't seem to lack for female companionship and even has a kind of Casanova reputation - even if he is a really nasty @hole in his treatment of women... I will say no more about the story.I found this film interesting in both of its main plots. The air war against Germany is well shown and even if it contains definitely less action scenes than &#34;Memphis Belle&#34;, exactly as one of other reviewers stated, this film is actually better. But the main story is about a very strange and atypical &#34;not-exactly-love&#34; triangle between Rickson, Bollander and Daphne.The character of Dahne is very well conceived, as a girl both tough and vulnerable, adorably conservative on the surface and in the same time unexpectedly adventurous - and Shirley Ann Field played her perfectly! The character of Bollander was also well thought over, as he is not some kind of romantic guy smitten by a young adorable damzel - much to the contrary, all charming that he may be, he is also in the same time a cynical, tough b@st@rd who looks mostly for a &#34;war time, good as it lasts&#34; comfortable booty call... Although, it may - or may not - change...But it is of course Rickson who is the center of the film and his character is as equivocal as he is disturbed. He is a riddle, and the director, very wisely, didn't want to give us the solution - although the hints keep accumulating during all the film. Me personally I had the impression, that either Rickson is a deeply closeted homosexual, who is in love with Bollander and insanely jalous, or, and that is my personal favourite hypothesis, he is straight but was rendered completely impotent by an episode from his early teenage years. No matter which one of those answers is true, he has been utterly miserable since like forever and as his whole adult life was dissimulation, acting, pretending and lying, all of this slowly but surely drives him crazy - and suicidal...Now of course I am not certain if I got this right - so the best thing is for you to watch this film and make up your mind.Bottom line, this is a good, solid, honest war film, a good, soild, honest war time romance and a good, solid, honest psychological drama. Enjoy!",4,"Hero? Psychopath? Closeted homosexual? Impotent? All of above?

I have remembered details from it ever since.The acting is fine and McQueen is excellent as the sociopath after whom the movie is titled.  I had never considered that he was playing the role of a sociopath.  The narcissism, lack of empathy, lack of a conscience, hyper-competitiveness, the ""the rules aren't made for me"" attitude, the conviction of superiority--all well done by McQueen.  The only part which I didn't believe was his final comments to Robert Wagner at the end.  I guess they wanted to rehabilitate his character for us.  With all the weirdness going on daily in our country and the world now (it didn't seem like that in 1962) the sociopathic personality is much better known and more quickly recognized now.  I'm trying to say McQueen's portrayal was excellent.The B-17's shown and the flying sequences are the best I've seen.  A note of trivia--the bombers shown are actually B-17G's, which did not appear until well-after 1943, but who's complaining?  Even the interior shots on the plane demonstrated a realism and attention to detail that would put Hollywood to shame.

746908,APHX2A37KDRAH,B00008R9M6,N. Trachta,"[6, 9]","The War Lover simply tells the tale of two B-17 pilots in love with Daphne Caldwell (Shirley Anne Field) during the middle of WWII.  To make things a little more complex (and of course a little more interesting), Capt Buzz Rickson (played by Steve McQueen) is a strong leader of his crew and the other pilot in love with Daphne is in his crew (Lt. Ed Bolland, played by Robert Wagner).  The frustrating piece to Buzz is that Ed is winning the war of love.My Likes:A story about WWII, especially one about air crews.  I've been fascinated for some time in bomber crews and what they went through.  Several boring days waiting for a mission and then you have several hours of raw excitement as you fight your way to and from the target.  The War Lover does a great job showing this.  The crew of The Body (the name of the B-17) are tight and fly as one.  Rickson leads, and none question him.  This is the romantic look at the bomber crew.  We see the crews excitement as the number of missions mount, knowing the odds are against them surviving their 25 missions.My Dislikes:The missions, the planes, and the romance.  The directors had the chance to follow the actual 8th Air Force missions in 1943 and they totally blew it.  They showed that they went to Sweinfurt (twice actually) but totally failed to take into account the other historical missions around this (Munster pops to mind).  Very disappointing given that the missions were history.The airplanes were disappointing also.  They showed B-17G's (chin gun) vs. B-17F's (what would have been flown given the time period).  This a minor nit until we add the fact that several 17's that crash landed failed to have ball turrets or other equipment on them.  I know B-17's were in short supply by 1962 but I expect people to try (in some ways it would have been better if they'd used models for the crashlandings).The romance also didn't sell me.  Shirley Anne Field is ok in the role but Robert Wagner just didn't do it for me with her.  I couldn't feel that they belonged together.  McQueen was good at playing the ""lover of war"", but he's a little distant for a person to like (yes, I know they wanted that but still, you want to like him because he's leading the crew of The Body).My Rating:Three stars and no more.  This movie had the chance to set up a great story and blew it.  Hanover Street does a better job showing a similar story and Harrison Ford blows McQueen and Wagner out of the water.  The romance in Hanover Street is also better to put it simply.  If you're not into Harrison Ford then watch From Here to Eternity.  If you want to watch a bomber movie about the crews, try 12 O'Clock High or Command Decision.  The only point I felt any real like in the movie was seeing the relationship between the crew members, especially the ending.  There's some good pieces here, but not enough to overcome a rather weak story.",3,The Body meets the Cliff,1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,2891,"['War', 'Lover', 'simply', 'tale', 'two', 'B-17', 'pilots', 'love', 'Daphne', 'Caldwell', 'Shirley', 'Anne', 'Field', 'middle', 'WWII', 'make', 'things', 'little', 'more', 'complex', 'course', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'Capt', 'Buzz', 'Rickson', 'played', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'strong', 'leader', 'crew', 'other', 'pilot', 'love', 'Daphne', 'crew', 'Lt.', 'Ed', 'Bolland', 'played', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'frustrating', 'piece', 'Buzz', 'Ed', 'winning', 'war', 'love.My', 'Likes', 'story', 'WWII', 'especially', 'one', 'air', 'crews', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fascinated', 'time', 'bomber', 'crews', 'what', 'went', 'Several', 'boring', 'days', 'waiting', 'mission', 'then', 'have', 'several', 'hours', 'raw', 'excitement', 'fight', 'way', 'target', 'War', 'Lover', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'crew', 'Body', 'name', 'B-17', 'are', 'tight', 'fly', 'one', 'Rickson', 'none', 'question', 'romantic', 'look', 'bomber', 'crew', 'see', 'crews', 'excitement', 'number', 'missions', 'mount', 'knowing', 'odds', 'are', 'surviving', '25', 'missions.My', 'Dislikes', 'missions', 'planes', 'romance', 'directors', 'had', 'chance', 'follow', 'actual', '8th', 'Air', 'Force', 'missions', '1943', 'totally', 'blew', 'showed', 'went', 'Sweinfurt', 'twice', 'actually', 'totally', 'failed', 'take', 'account', 'other', 'historical', 'missions', 'Munster', 'mind', 'Very', 'disappointing', 'given', 'missions', 'were', 'history.The', 'airplanes', 'were', 'disappointing', 'also', 'showed', 'B-17G', 'chin', 'gun', 'B-17F', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'flown', 'given', 'time', 'period', 'minor', 'nit', 'add', 'fact', 'several', '17', 'crash', 'landed', 'failed', 'have', 'ball', 'turrets', 'other', 'equipment', 'know', 'B-17', 'were', 'short', 'supply', '1962', 'expect', 'people', 'try', 'ways', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', ""'d"", 'used', 'models', 'crashlandings', '.The', 'romance', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'sell', 'Shirley', 'Anne', 'Field', 'ok', 'role', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'could', ""n't"", 'feel', 'belonged', 'together', 'McQueen', 'was', 'good', 'playing', 'lover', 'war', 'little', 'distant', 'person', 'like', 'yes', 'know', 'wanted', 'still', 'want', 'like', 'leading', 'crew', 'Body', '.My', 'Rating', 'Three', 'stars', 'more', 'movie', 'had', 'chance', 'set', 'up', 'great', 'story', 'blew', 'Hanover', 'Street', 'better', 'job', 'showing', 'similar', 'story', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'McQueen', 'Wagner', 'water', 'romance', 'Hanover', 'Street', 'also', 'better', 'put', 'simply', ""'re"", 'not', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'then', 'watch', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'want', 'watch', 'bomber', 'movie', 'crews', 'try', '12', ""O'Clock"", 'High', 'Command', 'Decision', 'only', 'point', 'felt', 'real', 'movie', 'was', 'seeing', 'relationship', 'crew', 'members', 'especially', 'ending', 'good', 'pieces', 'here', 'not', 'enough', 'overcome', 'rather', 'weak', 'story']",N/A

746911,AI48RS9GEGGFC,B00008R9M6,Richard M. Rollo,"[9, 10]","I read John Hersey's novel the War Lover  and later saw the movie when I was in my teens.  It was the first adult novel I read.  The novel and the movie were among the most profound influences on me at the time.  In the novel, the story is seen through the eyes of Lt. Boman (who is Lt. Boland in the movie) and is the co pilot on the B-17 bomber they call ""The Body.""  The pilot is Captain Buzz Marrow (whose name in the movie  is Buzz Rickson) and he is the war lover.  I'll use the movie names for the review. The movie does not employ Boland as the narrator; the story is told in the third person.On one level, it is an excellent account of the 8th Army Air Force and their strategic bombing missions over occupied Europe and Nazi Germany.  It features the B-17 bomber and the Norden bomb sight.  The movie had the authentic look and feel of 1940's England in my father's photographs.  It also shows starkly the dangers of those missions.  As destructive as the bombing was on the ground, the toll on men and airplanes was staggering.  The  1,000 plane mission over Leipzig cost 300 planes shot down and another 150 came back too damaged to fly again.  The toll on the surviving crews were terrible as well.  This story puts names and faces on those numbers.On another level,  it is a psychological story about Rickson.  Rickson  is the best pilot in the outfit and most of the crew is loyal to him.  He is something of a rebel; he doesn't do things by the book.  He also is highly competitive.  Whether flying  in the squadron or engaging in barroom contests, he has to come out on top.  He wants things done his way and when his crew or his superiors let him down, he retaliates.  Howard Koch in writing the script advances the story by peeling the skin off the onion layer by layer from Rickson's barroom jousts to his attempt to steal Daphne away from Boland.  When Rickson buzzes the field over his disappointment with dropping leaflets rather than bombs,  the colonel calls in Boland and the flight surgeon to evaluate Ricksons fitness to fly.  Boland remains loyal but he discovers Ricksons disloyalty to other crew members.  The flight surgeon tells Boland there is a fine line between being a hero and being a psychopath.Then, Rickson tries to steal Daphne away from Boland and fails. Boland comes to hate Rickson.  I better  stop here to avoid spoiling the ending.Steve McQueen, Robert Wagner, and Shirley Ann Field played their roles perfectly.  McQueen, the flawed hero who unravels gradually has the right amount of quirky charm alternating with enough menace to keep the other characters, except Daphne, off balance.I read the novel at 12 and saw the movie when I was 14.  During those years, I went to three different junior highs, and always felt like the new kid who had to prove himself.  This story was important in my understanding of human nature.  I strongly recommend the movie; it holds up really well in every way. I bought the DVD of this movie that comes in a box set with Baby the Rain Must Fall.

So here we go...First up, I'm a WWII history buff and I do love B-17's.  But I'm not going to bore anyone with a blow-by-blow account of any inaccuracies that may be contained in this movie.  Geez, I'm not that anal.  Just let me say that for what it's worth, this film is more accurate that many war flicks that have been made.  Nuff said 'bout that.The love story contained within the plot lines is plausable and reflects the mood of the era.  But for me it just got in the way of the flying sequences.  This film was shot in 1961 (premired in '62) and flyable B-17's were a plenty back in the day.  My favorite parts of the film were anything that showed a B-17.  Because there are so few in the air today, this makes ""The War Lover"" a magnificant time capsule of B-17's in-flight.  The only cheesy flying moments in the movie were near the beginning when they used a model B-17 to depict a Fort on fire and about to explode.  Other than that the aerial shots are preemo.However my main reason for purchasing this DVD was the scene about halfway through the film when a B-17 beats up the airfield after returning home from a leaflet dropping mission.  What a fantastic piece of flying; something that you'd never see a Flying Fort do today.  Many years ago I read a book that had a photograph taken from on the set when this flying scene was shot.  The caption mentioned that Martin Caidin flew the Fort that did the buzz job (Martin Caidin - obviously a pilot was also an American author who penned a couple of books on the B-17 and another little story about a cyborg human that whet on to become ""The Six Million Dollar Man"").  Martin Caidin did indeed fly co-pilot in a B-17 for the movie ""The War Lover"", but it was John Crewdson who beat up RAF Base Bovington.  It was an amazing piece of flying made even more incredible when you consider that Crewdson flew that B-17 acroos the grassy fields solo.Anyways, if you like B-17's, what to get a feel for what it was like to ride in one and think that Steve McQueen and Rob Wagner are cool, then this is a good movie to watch.
