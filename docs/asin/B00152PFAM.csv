I have mixed feelings about this video overall. Damian McGinty was only about 14 years old in this performance, but his voice and his showmanship were unbelievable. He had the skill and poise of a veteran performer. And Paul Byrom's soaring tenor voice was showcased on this DVD; what an incredible voice.But I think that the performance time given to the singers was disproportionate, with McGinty and Byrom being in the spotlight considerably more than the other guys.I have the Heritage DVD also, and it is by far my favorite of the two. Although the set is much, much smaller and less extravagant than The Show's, the sound and picture quality of Heritage is far better (on my TV anyway), and that's what matters to me.Another reason I favor Heritage over The Show is that the audience in The Show  seemed almost lifeless at times, whereas it was just the opposite with Heritage.",4,Good Show,1332460800,"03 23, 2012",2012,984,"['stage', 'backdrop', 'Show', 'are', 'pretty', 'spectacular', 'spacious', 'orchestra', 'pit', 'boot', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'video', 'overall', 'Damian', 'McGinty', 'was', 'only', 'about', '14', 'years', 'old', 'performance', 'voice', 'showmanship', 'were', 'unbelievable', 'had', 'skill', 'poise', 'veteran', 'performer', 'Paul', 'Byrom', 'soaring', 'tenor', 'voice', 'was', 'showcased', 'DVD', 'what', 'incredible', 'voice.But', 'think', 'performance', 'time', 'given', 'singers', 'was', 'disproportionate', 'McGinty', 'Byrom', 'being', 'spotlight', 'considerably', 'more', 'other', 'guys.I', 'have', 'Heritage', 'DVD', 'also', 'far', 'favorite', 'two', 'set', 'much', 'much', 'smaller', 'less', 'extravagant', 'Show', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'Heritage', 'far', 'better', 'TV', 'anyway', 'what', 'me.Another', 'reason', 'favor', 'Heritage', 'Show', 'audience', 'Show', 'seemed', 'almost', 'lifeless', 'times', 'was', 'just', 'opposite', 'Heritage']",N/A

You never hear the singers even take in a breath or a uneven level of sound no matter how high or low the pitch which is a sure sign of studio production and not a LIVE performance.  The other sign that it is not being performed live is that all of the performers don't all do a great job of matching their lips to the words. And when a singer is singing live you can see it their diaphragm, their body will move, some of the singers make this look believable whereas others look completely fake.  The worst offender being the young Damian McGinty. He doesn't even come close to matching the audio.  I really hope that they perform LIVE when in concert and that they only lip synched for this PBS broadcast.  Again I don't know 100% that they are lip synching but it looks extremely suspicious that they are not singing live.  It ruined the whole show for me.  They are obviously talented performers.  Go to a live theater show, and see for yourself, the singing doesn't sound like this, you can hear the tiny imperfections, proof that it is LIVE SINGING!",2,The whole thing looks like it was lip synched,1212883200,"06 8, 2008",2008,1479,"['style', 'romantic', 'Irish', 'music', 'thing', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'concert', 'However', 'was', 'disappointed', 'ENTIRE', 'thing', 'lip', 'synched', 'Having', 'worked', 'live', 'performance', 'entire', 'life', 'understand', 'difficulties', 'live', 'audio', 'production', 'especially', 'large', 'space', 'audio', 'DVD', 'extremely', 'produced', 'too', 'perfect', 'too', 'slick', 'especially', 'are', 'using', 'lavalier', 'mics', 'never', 'hear', 'singers', 'even', 'take', 'breath', 'uneven', 'level', 'sound', 'matter', 'how', 'high', 'low', 'pitch', 'sure', 'sign', 'studio', 'production', 'not', 'LIVE', 'performance', 'other', 'sign', 'not', 'being', 'performed', 'live', 'performers', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'matching', 'lips', 'words', 'when', 'singer', 'singing', 'live', 'can', 'see', 'diaphragm', 'body', 'will', 'move', 'singers', 'make', 'look', 'believable', 'whereas', 'others', 'look', 'completely', 'fake', 'worst', 'offender', 'being', 'young', 'Damian', 'McGinty', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'matching', 'audio', 'really', 'hope', 'perform', 'LIVE', 'when', 'concert', 'only', 'lip', 'synched', 'PBS', 'broadcast', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '100', '%', 'are', 'lip', 'synching', 'extremely', 'suspicious', 'are', 'not', 'singing', 'live', 'ruined', 'whole', 'show', 'are', 'obviously', 'talented', 'performers', 'Go', 'live', 'theater', 'show', 'see', 'singing', ""n't"", 'sound', 'can', 'hear', 'tiny', 'imperfections', 'proof', 'LIVE', 'SINGING']",N/A

Some of these songs are just so good. I love ""Come by the Hills"" that Damian does. In this one, he sings part of it in English, and does a great job, even though he was quite young at the time. He also does ""A Bird Without Wings."" another very nice song. Later, he sings a couple of old US songs from the fifties or early sixties, (I am not sure, but they are quite cute, and my family got a kick out of them).Keith sings ""The Island,"" which happens to have been the first song I every heard him sing. I was glued to my monitor. What a thought-provoker. He is really a good story teller. ""Lauren & I"" is a song he wrote, and it is quite engaging. His other solo is ""I Want to Know what Love Is."" David Phelps (a marvelous singer) does the same song, ~and they are so different in their presentation that one would scarcely notice that it is the same song. I like them both, but for the type of song this is, Keith makes it sound more personal. He has that low,soft presentation that sounds like he's thinking, and for this song, it really works. (This is a big statement for me, because I love David's singing.)Ryan is a kick. He makes me smile. Those girls that help him and Paul do numbers are great, because I should laugh aloud, for sure. He can also be very serious. He is fun to watch when he is flirting or whatever, and rather fascinating when he is dramatic. I really like him.You must hear Paul sing Knights in White Satin. Very pretty. Paul has a most well-trained voice. Another pleasure to hear is, ""Love Thee Dearest."" I enjoy him on all his songs. There is no reason not to; he has a great voice.George is another good story-teller. Oh, they all are -but Keith and George tell the touchy feely ones; Ryan's are usually more dramatic, whether romantic or about some dramatic event. George has a nice rather deep voice and a solid presence. He, like the other Irishmen has a twinkle in his eyes and an engaging expression that seems about to give birth to a secret. His solos are slices of life for the most part. I find Damian and Keith to be the more solemn ones, when they are serious. Ryan and George, even when serious, look like they might smile at any moment, and Paul has a cute way of flirting with the program, and sometimes he too looks like he is about to surprise somebody.I believe you would enjoy this DVD.

To me that is 100% subject to individual taste.  I may love Josh Grobin, All American Rejects, Coldplay, The Verve, etc. and you may hate them all or any one of them.  No problem. So I'll limit talking about my own personal musical tastes in writing this review.My first exposure to Celtic Thunder was some late-night TV commercial enticing me to buy their DVD online. I am not for or against Celtic music but honestly have never bought any. I liked the short blurb I saw about this DVD so I searched Amazon and found there was a DVD version under $15 bucks so I bought it. The shipping point was in my home town, so even though I bought it late Sunday night I received it early Tuesday with no tax and no shipping charges. Woohoo, thank you Amazon!We played about half the DVD the first night. YOU decide if you love them or hate them musically but my review is that the video quality is one of the best I have seen ... very close to Blu-Ray quality on a normal DVD player. The editing is expert ... clean, logical and unobtrusive. The audio is first-rate, very transparent and clean, it took full advantage of my Amazon-purchased amplifier and speakers.For under fifteen bucks, it is hard to imagine a DVD that will bring you more entertainment. Ok, maybe Celtic music isn't for everybody but these performers are way too wide ranged to be considered only ""Celtic"". There are a couple of songs that truly brought tears to my eyes, and one or two (like Damien singing Puppy Love) that were so infectious that even the studio musicians on the DVD were so overtaken by smiles that they almost lost place playing their instruments.For the price, even if you watch this DVD only once, it is hard to imagine anyone not falling in love with it.PROS:  Good cheap entertainment, great video and soundCONS:  Logical assumption that they would sing together more, it's mostly a series of solosBONUS:  Totally fresh versions of a few very familiar songs.

He has manliness without the brovado or stage drama. His approach and sincerity strikes a chord deep within me. Next I had to notice Keith with his lighter, golden voice. He has a lot of honesty and isn't afraid to be vulnerable at times. Very nice in group and individual pieces. Damian of course can't help stealing the show, running to the front on the fast songs, or slowly pacing with tender inflection on songs like ""Come By the Hills"" and ""A Bird Without Wings"". Paul and Ryan balance what could have been a vanilla mix with drama and comedy. I really don't like ""Heartbreaker"", and Ryan also plays the evil jerk in ""That's A Woman"", but ""Ride On"" and ""Brothers in Arms"" are mysterious and exciting, and Paul is very good for some ushy gushy romance. Simply said, this is a very cool show. The only reason I give four stars instead of five is because I can't help thinking it would have been even better if they had decided to lean slightly closer to a traditional blend.

The voices are superb, the production values are excellent, and I fell in love with the woman in the blue dress who played the cello.  I think those who liked the musical variety shows on television (Lawrence Welk, Andy Williams, Perry Como) will like this very much.  My mother, for example, loved it.  She also likes Celtic Women and Lord of the Dance, and other ""pretty"" music. It's all very pleasant, if not very exciting. It looks wonderful, however, and the audience appeared to enjoy the show immensely.I don't believe the singers were live, but they did an excellent job of lip-synching. Along that line, I'm not positive that the ""live"" shots of the audience were truly live.  It may well be that shots were inserted during the editing process (a shot of a young girl with tears streaming down her face during one song seemed suspiciously lucky).As to the complaints that this isn't authentic or traditional Irish music, well, some of it is. It's not the Chieftains, or even Clannad, but it's pretty good pop music.

I've seen the Beatles live (Forest Hills Stadium, NYC 1964); and the whole gamut from Rick James to Hank, Jr. Video - or live - this is the best concert I've seen in my life.

A young teen (Damian McGinty) who will absolutely knock your socks off; Paul Byrom, a genuine Irish Tenor, who's doing his best work in a group format; Ryan Kelly, a young accountant who's living his dream with a killer voice; Keith Harkin a future solo superstar singer, guitarist, and composer who the whole world will hear from soon; and George Donaldson, a Scottish folk singer, who cannot be ignored by the Broadway stage. Phil Coulter and Sharon Brown have created a visually stunning project that grabs you for close to 2 hours and won't let go. Add the super work of whistle & pipe genius, Brendan Monaghan, top-flight guitarist Neil Byrne, bassist, Nigel Wheatley, and percussionists Rory McCarron and Audrey Bridgeman, and it's the greatest concert experience you can have.
