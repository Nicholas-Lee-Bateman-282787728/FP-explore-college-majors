I was disappointed when I saw it was only 1 of 2. But I got the first so late I didn't have too long before to 2nd was out. Back to the review everything you loved about seasons 1-3 is back.

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[2, 3]","I've always felt that RESCUE ME was one of the best written, directed and acted series on television, but the creators faltered during this 5th Season.There are still some truly memorable moments in many of the episodes.  A scene between Andrea Roth and Callie Thorne in the firehouse still brings a smile to my face every time I think about it, as does a sequence with the guys at a supermarket.I think that the problem with this season is that it ran 22 episodes, rather than the usual 13, and the writers/producers did not come up with enough story to fill it.  Thus, the plot moves forward at a snail's pace, and there are too many scenes which are just marking time.The season finale is certainly a cliff-hanger.Hopefully, Season 6 will be better. Michael B.

Great comedic and dramatic writing and the actors are at their peak in this series. Tommy's past comes back to haunt him and his spiral into alcoholism is directly linked to his actions on the day of September 11 2001. The characters reflections on that day are the most mature pieces ever seen on the show and the writers obviously had a lot of interaction with real survivors to gain those insights. There is more firefighting and action in this series than others, which is great. And the comedy is sharp and insightful. All in all a terrific season.",5,Season 5 Part 2 is a great watch,1271808000,"04 21, 2010",2010,631,"['Season', '5', 'Part', '2', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Great', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'writing', 'actors', 'are', 'peak', 'series', 'Tommy', 'past', 'back', 'haunt', 'spiral', 'alcoholism', 'directly', 'linked', 'actions', 'day', 'September', '11', '2001', 'characters', 'reflections', 'day', 'are', 'most', 'mature', 'pieces', 'ever', 'seen', 'show', 'writers', 'obviously', 'had', 'lot', 'interaction', 'real', 'survivors', 'gain', 'insights', 'more', 'firefighting', 'action', 'series', 'others', 'great', 'comedy', 'sharp', 'insightful', 'terrific', 'season']",N/A

1280014,AK5PXHJI808E6,B002NPCE7M,"NYC critic ""Mac""","[1, 3]","I used to thoroughly enjoy this show.  It was well written, acted, and conceived.  This season saw an end to all that.  Like most long-running American shows, characters have outlived their usefulness and story arcs have begun to repeat and become tiresome.  Some suggestions:1. Get rid of the wife.  It was a brilliant--and necessary--move in Dexter; follow suit.  The city is filled with women and potential story lines.  Being hung-up on your ex for going on years now is the stuff of ""Young and the Restless.""2. Cut back on Sheila. She is occasionally good for comic relief, but too often is too much.3. Enough with the AA soapbox.  I realize that addiction is a serious ad worthy topic, but the see-saw is tedious.4. Develop more stories about the firehouse characters.  Avoid stunt casting.  (The Michael J. Fox subplot was pointless and ridiculous and having his character squeeze your package for minutes while you stood there and took it made your character weak, nothing else.) It seems as if most characters are now in search of something to do. Find it for them.5.  Don't wait until ""end episodes"" to pull out the stops and up the ante.This used to be a great show and could be again, but if you've truly run out of ideas, let the show go.  Maybe four or five years is all it should have been to start with.",3,Dear Mr. Leary,1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,1319,"['used', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'show', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'acted', 'conceived', 'season', 'saw', 'end', 'most', 'long-running', 'American', 'shows', 'characters', 'have', 'outlived', 'usefulness', 'story', 'arcs', 'have', 'begun', 'repeat', 'become', 'tiresome', 'suggestions:1', 'Get', 'rid', 'wife', 'was', 'brilliant', 'necessary', 'move', 'Dexter', 'follow', 'suit', 'city', 'filled', 'women', 'potential', 'story', 'lines', 'Being', 'hung-up', 'ex', 'going', 'years', 'now', 'stuff', 'Young', 'Restless.', '2', 'Cut', 'back', 'Sheila', 'occasionally', 'good', 'comic', 'relief', 'too', 'often', 'too', 'much.3', 'Enough', 'AA', 'soapbox', 'realize', 'addiction', 'serious', 'ad', 'worthy', 'topic', 'see-saw', 'tedious.4', 'Develop', 'more', 'stories', 'firehouse', 'characters', 'Avoid', 'stunt', 'casting', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'subplot', 'was', 'pointless', 'ridiculous', 'having', 'character', 'squeeze', 'package', 'minutes', 'stood', 'took', 'made', 'character', 'weak', 'nothing', 'else', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'now', 'search', 'something', 'do', 'Find', 'them.5', 'Do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'end', 'episodes', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'up', 'ante.This', 'used', 'be', 'great', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'again', ""'ve"", 'truly', 'run', 'ideas', 'let', 'show', 'go', 'Maybe', 'four', 'five', 'years', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'start']",N/A
