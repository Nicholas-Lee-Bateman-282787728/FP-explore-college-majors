If you watch the preview you can pretty much fill in the rest...no curve balls here. It was refreshing not to have explicit nudity in a movie. You could have your teenager's girlfriend or boyfriend over and watch this with them. Still, it needed something more.",3,Somewhat cute and romantic but mostly boring and slow,1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,344,"['movie', 'needed', 'something', 'more', 'humor', 'deeper', 'plot', 'faster', 'pace', 'something', 'watch', 'preview', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'fill', 'rest', 'curve', 'here', 'was', 'refreshing', 'not', 'have', 'explicit', 'nudity', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'teenager', 'girlfriend', 'boyfriend', 'watch', 'Still', 'needed', 'something', 'more']",3 Days of Normal
1667228,A3PM07XE78NOCY,B00EHZ5QEY,Lynn R.,"[2, 2]","The plot was fairly entertaining, but nothing else about this movie was above average. The acting was okay at best, the script so-so. Also the dialogue was a bit crude for my taste. This film could have been improved with an expanded story line; it was only 1 hour 20 minutes long. All in all, I did not think it was worth the $3.99 I had to pay.",3,Not worth $4,1378857600,"09 11, 2013",2013,346,"['plot', 'was', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'was', 'above', 'average', 'acting', 'was', 'okay', 'best', 'script', 'so-so', 'Also', 'dialogue', 'was', 'bit', 'crude', 'taste', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'improved', 'expanded', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'only', '1', 'hour', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'worth', '3.99', 'had', 'pay']",3 Days of Normal
