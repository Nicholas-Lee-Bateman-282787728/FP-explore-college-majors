Aiken,"[4, 13]","I've always liked the PSB's music, and after seeing some spectacular videos from bands that started up about the same time, such as OMD, The Cure, NIN, and others, I thought I'd try this Pet Shop Boys release.Neil Tennant does a great job delivering the Karaoke against the tracks that Chris calls up on his CD player disguised as a keyboard.  Neil's voice sounds great, and when he's in close-up, I forget for a minute what an abyssmally crappy DVD this is.When I see the full stage, I'm treated to what I can only call a half-assed middle-school version of Cirque de Soleil, with two somewhat amateurish hacks performing cutesy little tricks and other mild contortions.  Most of the time the lone backup singer is lounging on a couch watching this lame-assed stage show, looking bored out of her skull, as I was during my viewing of this lemon.For me, the only use for this DVD is as a coaster.Enjoy your PSB CDs and save your money by avoiding this thoroughly unentertaining offering.",1,Karaoke in Concert,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",2011,987,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'PSB', 'music', 'seeing', 'spectacular', 'videos', 'bands', 'started', 'up', 'same', 'time', 'such', 'OMD', 'Cure', 'NIN', 'others', 'thought', ""'d"", 'try', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Boys', 'release.Neil', 'Tennant', 'great', 'job', 'delivering', 'Karaoke', 'tracks', 'Chris', 'up', 'CD', 'player', 'disguised', 'keyboard', 'Neil', 'voice', 'great', 'when', 'close-up', 'forget', 'minute', 'what', 'abyssmally', 'crappy', 'DVD', 'is.When', 'see', 'full', 'stage', ""'m"", 'treated', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'call', 'half-assed', 'middle-school', 'version', 'Cirque', 'de', 'Soleil', 'two', 'somewhat', 'amateurish', 'hacks', 'performing', 'cutesy', 'little', 'tricks', 'other', 'mild', 'contortions', 'Most', 'time', 'lone', 'backup', 'singer', 'lounging', 'couch', 'watching', 'lame-assed', 'stage', 'show', 'looking', 'bored', 'skull', 'was', 'viewing', 'lemon.For', 'only', 'use', 'DVD', 'coaster.Enjoy', 'PSB', 'CDs', 'save', 'money', 'avoiding', 'thoroughly', 'unentertaining', 'offering']",N/A
1081660,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B000RHRGDU,Lesley Aeschliman,"[1, 1]","Cubism is a concert film for a show from the duo's concert tour to promote the Fundamental album.  The film was shot at the show in Mexico City on November 14, 2006.  The booklet that's included with the DVD is very well-done.  It contains a nine page article, which tells about stories and anectdotes from the tour.  It's a long read, but an interesting one.The DVD itself contains the concert film, which runs for about 103 minutes.  The Pet Shop Boys included a great mix of songs from Fundamental and older songs from their catalog.  One of the most poignant moments in the film is the performance of the song ""Dreaming of the Queen.""  While they perform the song, footage from right after Princess Diana's funeral is shown on the screen behind them.  It's definitely the most somber moment of the show.  However, the set list is made up much more from such upbeat numbers as ""Left To My Own Devices,"" ""I'm With Stupid,"" ""Opportunities (Let's Make Lots Of Money),"" ""It's A Sin,"" as well as other songs.For extras, there is a short documentary about the Pet Shop Boys in Mexico.  You need to have to subtitles on if you don't know Spanish, because quite a bit of the documentary is comments from fans that are in Spanish.  There is a photo gallery that runs for about two minutes.  While the viewer doesn't have any control over when the pictures change, the slideshow is set to the music that's playing in the background.  It's probably one of the more interesting DVD slideshows I've seen.  There is also commentary of the concert film provided by Neil Tennant, Chris Lowe and David Barnard.If you're a fan of the Pet Shop Boys, I would recommend purchasing this DVD.  It's a well-done presentation of a great performance.I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD that my husband purchased.",5,This was a well-done concert DVD,1287532800,"10 20, 2010",2010,1807,"['Cubism', 'concert', 'film', 'show', 'duo', 'concert', 'tour', 'promote', 'Fundamental', 'album', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'show', 'Mexico', 'City', 'November', '14', '2006', 'booklet', 'included', 'DVD', 'very', 'well-done', 'nine', 'page', 'article', 'stories', 'anectdotes', 'tour', 'long', 'read', 'interesting', 'one.The', 'DVD', 'concert', 'film', '103', 'minutes', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Boys', 'included', 'great', 'mix', 'songs', 'Fundamental', 'older', 'songs', 'catalog', 'One', 'most', 'poignant', 'moments', 'film', 'performance', 'song', 'Dreaming', 'Queen', 'perform', 'song', 'footage', 'right', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'funeral', 'shown', 'screen', 'definitely', 'most', 'somber', 'moment', 'show', 'However', 'set', 'list', 'made', 'up', 'much', 'more', 'such', 'upbeat', 'numbers', 'Left', 'My', 'Own', 'Devices', ""'m"", 'Stupid', 'Opportunities', 'Let', 'Make', 'Lots', 'Money', 'Sin', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'songs.For', 'extras', 'short', 'documentary', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Boys', 'Mexico', 'need', 'have', 'subtitles', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Spanish', 'quite', 'bit', 'documentary', 'comments', 'fans', 'are', 'Spanish', 'photo', 'gallery', 'two', 'minutes', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'have', 'control', 'when', 'pictures', 'change', 'slideshow', 'set', 'music', 'playing', 'background', 'probably', 'one', 'more', 'interesting', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'also', 'commentary', 'concert', 'film', 'provided', 'Neil', 'Tennant', 'Chris', 'Lowe', 'David', 'Barnard.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Pet', 'Shop', 'Boys', 'would', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'DVD', 'well-done', 'presentation', 'great', 'performance.I', 'wrote', 'review', 'watching', 'copy', 'DVD', 'husband', 'purchased']",N/A
