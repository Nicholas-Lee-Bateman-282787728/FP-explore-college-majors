There is a house with people who have an alarm clock connected to sticks of ""dynamite"". Katie's father talks about his daughter. Katie's mother talks about her young life. Did she get involved with a bad crowd? Was she too proud to admit a mistake? Katherine dresses in disguise to plant a time bomb. She came from a very wealthy family. Was she head-strong? She volunteers to teach children to read. A girlfriend marries her boyfriend so he won't be drafted. Instead of graduate school she wants to help people in South America. There are flashbacks to the news of 1965. Katy teaches children to read, then adults too. She experiences rural life and sees the oppression by a big landowner who doesn't want education for the people. [Ignorant people are easier to control.]She learns about political oppression when a man is shot on the street. She travels to the mountains, where people seek refuge. Can change occur without guns and ammunition? Katie learns the realities of feudal life. Is she too arrogant? What about life in America? Katie becomes serious and bitter over what she saw. Donated food from America was being sold. The Embassy tells her she is being expelled that very day! She learned a lesson. People saw how she changed. Someone has lost his ranch (due to a personal fault). She volunteers to teach poor children at a school in the South, and learns about life there. The Fire Inspector closes the school. She learns about the attitude of the people she wants to help. ""Do you believe all that?"" ""You can't love a system you are trying to destroy."" Katie becomes a member of the SDS and visits colleges to organize.Will Katie have a child? She returns home with Bob to meet her parents. ""A martini."" ""Yes, he is."" ""What is a normal life?"" Bob talks to Katie's father. ""What is life about?"" Katie has become radicalized. Bob is agreeable. Katie is told about her grandfather (before he got rich). She wants to change the system. [Are people kept misinformed so they can be controlled?] ""Be careful"" says her father. Does their wealth come from other people's poverty? There is news from 1968. Katie goes to Chicago and meets an old friend, they discuss their lives. Katie is changing. The police throw tear gas then club the demonstrators. ""Katie, be careful!"" But she is arrested and put in jail. Katie makes a decision about her body. [Is this a sign of too much pride?] Did some people see what they wanted to see?Who is that man following Katie? Nixon took over in 1969. There is a meeting where people argue over the correct methods for political resistance. Slogans? ""Carpe diem""? Can Katie get more money from her Dad? They buy stolen guns. Will Katie join a ""collective""? Bob left for Canada to avoid arrest. Katie went underground with a new identity. Nixon invaded Cambodia in 1970. Katie lost touch with her family. The group tries new tactics. Their invasion of a school leads to arrests. Katie returns home (remembrance?). She has a new attitude. ""Are there any old revolutionaries?"" asks her Mom. Does Katie understand herself? She writes a farewell letter to her parents. We hear an explosion outside that museum. Next we see comments from her friends and relatives. Could she have found another way?There is a moral to this story ""inspired by true events"". Know your limits.

As a young child, around Todd's age, during the making of this movie I only heard talk of some of the similar events in this film but, understood less the significance of Revolutionary Idealist contribution or their dedication to trying to make life better for others in this world.

I enjoy studying the socio-politcal environment of the 70's and this film, I believe, really explains the tone of that era. When I had first seen that film I took it for granted that it was loosley based on Patty Hearst's story, because that is what it said on the box. I'm grateful to others here who have explained that it is really about the Weathermen (which I hadn't heard of and have subsequently viewed a documentary about). That make a lot more sense.For anyone else who is interested in studying this time period, I recommend this film, the documentary called The Weather Underground, Network and Across the Universe.
