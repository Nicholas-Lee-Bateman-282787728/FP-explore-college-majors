1163526,A3LWC833HQIG7J,B0019HQIFE,austin_Larry,"[0, 1]","Something resonated with the first Mayer song I heard in 2001 No Such Thing. I bought Any Given Thursday DVD when it came out so I have known about his musicianship from early on. I also like jazz so got Try! when it came out. Mayer took all of what he had learned and down not only from 2001 to 2007 but all those years training himself and put together one of the finest concert performances, well in recent history at least.Even though his personal choices don't seem to match the lyrics of his songs often, he does write touching, moving lyrics and is arguably one of the better songwriters of the last 15 years. I think he is on par with the best guitarists of the last 50 years. And you get him in all his incarnations her: acoustic, jazz trio, and band. I have been to two live shows and this band set up I like best. He had horns the first time I saw him and ditched them the second time. First time was better.You get some great drumming from Steve Jordan. 'Dayla' his long-time bassist is in the band set. I bought the DVD years ago and the Blu-Ray recently. Blu-ray is very well done. I'd go for that, it is a real treat although the DVD is a great price now. I doubt a single-concert goer that night said well that sucked or I didn't get my money' worth.

1163530,AXIX71D75HMIK,B0019HQIFE,Brat Cat,"[4, 14]","First off, I'm a major John Mayer fan. I have all his CDs, along with the ""Any Given Thursday"" DVD. I think he's very talented, both as a musician and as a songwriter. I'm still a fan, and am eagerly awaiting his new CD later this year.So why did I give it only two stars? Overall, my disappointment is a result of the song list. I like the songs themselves, but there aren't enough upbeat tunes in this concert. Obviously the acoustic set is subdued, but most of the ""band set"" is comprised of slower songs as well. It leaves a final reflection of ""Well, that was a sleeper of a show.""On the plus side:I like the idea of splitting the DVD into three sets of different genres: solo acoustic, blues rock, and the full band set.There is a fair amount of interview time (much shot while John drives his car around town) spread across the disc.On the down side:The acoustic section is painfully boring. Even though ""Daughters"" and ""Stop this Train"", are basically acoustic numbers anyway, I don't think the songs in this set translate over to straight acoustic well. And he ruined ""Train"" by substituting the piano part with whistling - that just seemed awkward. Even when he brings other musicians onstage to share the guitar duties, it still feels empty. And his version of Freefallin' is just plain horrible. He trudges through it like it's a dirge.I know he's expanding his blues skills, but when he nonchalantly played aimlessly wandering blues licks between (and during) songs it was more annoying than entertaining. Ditto for the ""Slow Dancing on Mulholland Drive"" section, which is just him talking and playing more blues runs. By the way, that ""special feature"" is only about five minutes long, barely worth listing on the package.If you like the John Mayer Trio CD then you'll be pleased with the second set. It's done well, with a good amount of backstage footage of John, Pino, and Steve.The 'band set"" should have had more of his older songs. Of the nine songs in this set, seven are from Continuum. Since the ""Thursday"" DVD came out prior to Heavier Things, he should have included more songs from that CD on this video. It's unfortunate that, with the exception of ""Something's Missing"" on ""Thursday"", there is no live footage from that album available. And as I mentioned above, many of the songs he chose for this set are slower ones, which drained the excitement out of what could have been an electrifying performance.That's my opinion of this DVD, but seeing how many four and five star ratings others have given it, maybe you shouldn't take this review too seriously!If you're at a toss-up of which live JM DVD to buy,I would suggest ""Any Given Thursday"" over this one.",2,"In a word, ""disappointing.""",1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,2686,"['First', ""'m"", 'major', 'John', 'Mayer', 'fan', 'have', 'CDs', 'Any', 'Given', 'Thursday', 'DVD', 'think', 'very', 'talented', 'musician', 'songwriter', ""'m"", 'still', 'fan', 'am', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'new', 'CD', 'later', 'year.So', 'why', 'did', 'give', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'Overall', 'disappointment', 'result', 'song', 'list', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'upbeat', 'tunes', 'concert', 'Obviously', 'acoustic', 'set', 'subdued', 'most', 'band', 'set', 'comprised', 'slower', 'songs', 'well', 'final', 'reflection', 'Well', 'was', 'sleeper', 'show', 'plus', 'side', 'like', 'idea', 'splitting', 'DVD', 'three', 'sets', 'different', 'genres', 'solo', 'acoustic', 'blues', 'rock', 'full', 'band', 'fair', 'amount', 'interview', 'time', 'much', 'shot', 'John', 'car', 'town', 'spread', 'disc.On', 'down', 'side', 'acoustic', 'section', 'painfully', 'boring', 'Even', 'Daughters', 'Stop', 'Train', 'are', 'basically', 'acoustic', 'numbers', 'anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'songs', 'set', 'translate', 'straight', 'acoustic', 'well', 'ruined', 'Train', 'substituting', 'piano', 'part', 'whistling', 'just', 'seemed', 'awkward', 'Even', 'when', 'other', 'musicians', 'onstage', 'share', 'guitar', 'duties', 'still', 'empty', 'version', 'Freefallin', 'just', 'plain', 'horrible', 'dirge.I', 'know', 'expanding', 'blues', 'skills', 'when', 'nonchalantly', 'played', 'aimlessly', 'wandering', 'blues', 'licks', 'songs', 'was', 'more', 'annoying', 'entertaining', 'Ditto', 'Slow', 'Dancing', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'section', 'just', 'talking', 'playing', 'more', 'blues', 'runs', 'way', 'special', 'feature', 'only', 'about', 'five', 'minutes', 'long', 'barely', 'worth', 'listing', 'package.If', 'John', 'Mayer', 'Trio', 'CD', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleased', 'second', 'set', 'done', 'well', 'good', 'amount', 'backstage', 'footage', 'John', 'Pino', 'Steve.The', ""'band"", 'set', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'older', 'songs', 'nine', 'songs', 'set', 'seven', 'are', 'Continuum', 'Thursday', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'prior', 'Heavier', 'Things', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'more', 'songs', 'CD', 'video', 'unfortunate', 'exception', 'Something', 'Missing', 'Thursday', 'live', 'footage', 'album', 'available', 'mentioned', 'many', 'songs', 'chose', 'set', 'are', 'slower', 'ones', 'drained', 'excitement', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'electrifying', 'performance.That', 'opinion', 'DVD', 'seeing', 'how', 'many', 'four', 'five', 'star', 'ratings', 'others', 'have', 'given', 'maybe', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'review', 'too', 'seriously', ""'re"", 'toss-up', 'live', 'JM', 'DVD', 'buy', 'would', 'suggest', 'Any', 'Given', 'Thursday', 'one']",John Mayer: Where the Light Is - Live in Los Angeles

But if you are looking for something that can be used to make your home theater set-up shine, this is it.  The video quality is top notch. The audio is perfect.  Clean, clear, well balanced, and mixed for 5.1 perfectly.  If all 5.1 music was mixed like this everyone would buy much of it.  Perfection is in your hand when you hold the Blu Ray and it is in your room when you turn it on. The best of the three sets is the trio. I've never heard three musicians play with so much energy that you think it is a much larger band. Absolutely incredible.Not only is John Mayer extremely talented as a musician, he is an entertainer of the highest degree as well.  I would have loved to have been at this concert in person.  Doing three sets with three different formats was genius.  It is a long concert.  John really gave his all for his fans. You can see how much he loves music and performing.

1163556,A23NSKTMSPPBTR,B0019HQIFE,Wayne,"[2, 3]","I suspect that most people who are considering buying this disc are already familiar with John Mayer.  Then again, I'm sure I'm not the only one who got the disc with Sony's promotion for their Blu-ray player.One review panned the disc because of bad video and sound quality.  The quality you get will depend on your equipment.  I have Sony's top end current generation TV, and their newest Blu-ray player, so I assume that I'm seeing it as they intended it.  The video quality does not rise to what you might expect from blu-ray.  Because of the concert hall spot lights, faces were washed out and lacking in detail.As for the sound, a good recording can sound bad on bad equipment, but you can't make a bad recording sound good on good equipment. Top quality equipment will reproduce every flaw. If others heard good sound, there's a reason. The sound is excellent.But what's most important is the music and presentation. If you are already a fan, stop reading and buy it.  In my case, the audience members looked closer to my children's age than mine, so he obviously appeals to a younger fan base.  But if you grew up listening to guitar, and enjoy the music of guitar heroes whose music is rooted in blues, you can be 60 and still like this music.His singing is very good, and his guitar playing is excellent.  I wouldn't use the word virtuoso, but I would say that he plays with feeling and emotion.  His music is compelling.His guitar style is a blend of originality and channeling classic players.  His acoustic style shows originality and his acoustic set is quite good.  He then goes to an electric set with a trio, and starts with a classic blues song.  On that one, his playing lacked originality, but had plenty of feel.  If you liked the original, you'll like this because the feel is there, but I think he is capable of more.He then went into a Hendrix cover, but he made it his own. It showed his talent.  Later, he played some blues songs where he seemed to channel Hendrix in his style, and there are also hints of many other players in his playing.His blend of styles, song writing and playing show that he is not somebody whose songs will sound the same or be stuck in a narrow genre. The video quality could have been better, but it's the music that counts.",4,refreshing,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,2278,"['suspect', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'considering', 'buying', 'disc', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'John', 'Mayer', 'Then', 'again', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'got', 'disc', 'Sony', 'promotion', 'Blu-ray', 'player.One', 'review', 'panned', 'disc', 'bad', 'video', 'sound', 'quality', 'quality', 'get', 'will', 'depend', 'equipment', 'have', 'Sony', 'top', 'end', 'current', 'generation', 'TV', 'newest', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'assume', ""'m"", 'seeing', 'intended', 'video', 'quality', 'not', 'rise', 'what', 'might', 'expect', 'blu-ray', 'concert', 'hall', 'spot', 'lights', 'were', 'washed', 'out', 'lacking', 'detail.As', 'sound', 'good', 'recording', 'can', 'sound', 'bad', 'bad', 'equipment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'recording', 'sound', 'good', 'good', 'equipment', 'Top', 'quality', 'equipment', 'will', 'reproduce', 'flaw', 'others', 'heard', 'good', 'sound', 'reason', 'sound', 'excellent.But', 'what', 'most', 'important', 'music', 'presentation', 'are', 'already', 'fan', 'stop', 'reading', 'buy', 'case', 'audience', 'members', 'looked', 'closer', 'children', 'age', 'mine', 'obviously', 'appeals', 'younger', 'fan', 'base', 'grew', 'up', 'listening', 'guitar', 'enjoy', 'music', 'guitar', 'heroes', 'music', 'rooted', 'blues', 'can', 'be', '60', 'still', 'music.His', 'singing', 'very', 'good', 'guitar', 'playing', 'excellent', 'would', ""n't"", 'use', 'word', 'virtuoso', 'would', 'say', 'feeling', 'emotion', 'music', 'compelling.His', 'guitar', 'style', 'blend', 'originality', 'channeling', 'classic', 'players', 'acoustic', 'style', 'originality', 'acoustic', 'set', 'quite', 'good', 'then', 'electric', 'set', 'trio', 'classic', 'blues', 'song', 'one', 'playing', 'lacked', 'originality', 'had', 'plenty', 'feel', 'liked', 'original', ""'ll"", 'like', 'feel', 'there', 'think', 'capable', 'more.He', 'then', 'went', 'Hendrix', 'cover', 'made', 'own', 'showed', 'talent', 'Later', 'played', 'blues', 'songs', 'where', 'seemed', 'channel', 'Hendrix', 'style', 'are', 'also', 'hints', 'many', 'other', 'players', 'playing.His', 'blend', 'styles', 'song', 'writing', 'playing', 'show', 'not', 'somebody', 'songs', 'will', 'sound', 'same', 'be', 'stuck', 'narrow', 'genre', 'video', 'quality', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'music']",John Mayer: Where the Light Is - Live in Los Angeles
