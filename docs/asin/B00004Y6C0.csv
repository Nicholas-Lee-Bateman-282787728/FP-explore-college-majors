558356,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00004Y6C0,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[2, 3]","The film Jake Speed (1986) poses an interesting question...what if those action/adventure heroes popularized in the pulp novels (Doc Savage, Mack Bolan, Remo Williams, etc.) were real, and their exploits within the novels were based off their true life adventures?  Co-written by Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane (Lane also directed here), the pair behind the popular 1980s film Valley Girl (1983), the film stars Crawford (White Ghost, The Evil Below) and Karen Kopins (Creator, Once Bitten), who looks a hell of a lot like Erin `Col. Wilma Deering' Gray from the television show ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"".  Also appearing is Dennis Christopher (Breaking Away, Chariots of Fire) and John Hurt (Alien, The Elephant Man, V for Vendetta).The film begins with a lengthy sequence taking place in Paris involving the kidnapping of a young, female American college student (the oversized USC sweater hanging off the shoulder was sort of a giveaway) by a couple of tough looking locals.  Back in the states we meet Margaret Winston (Kopins), who, as it turns out, is the older sister to the girl we saw abducted earlier.  Guilt weighs heavily on Margaret's mind as she's the one who pushed her sister to go out and experience the world, and now blames herself for her sister's predicament.  Her grandfather, played by Leon Ames, recommends they try to get one of the men from his pulpy adventure novels to take the case, indicating perhaps it's time to up the dosage of Grandpa's medication.  Things seem bleak, but hope arrives in the form of a mysterious note, one that leads Margaret to a meeting with none other than Jake Speed (Crawford), a character from one of the novels gramps favors so much, and Desmond Floyd (Christopher), Speed's assistant (maybe Grandpa wasn't as loony as he first appeared, but I still think he could do with more meds).  Seems the men are interested in taking on the job of recovering Margaret's sister (turns out she's somewhere in Africa, taken in by a white slavers), but only if Margaret accompanies them (every pulpy adventure story needs a comely female lead).  Margaret's leery at first, but agrees mainly because Jake and Desmond seem men of action, and she's gotten farther in finding her sister in one day with them than five weeks with the state department.  Anyway, Margaret arrives in a podunk African town on the verge of being torn apart by revolution, and the fun begins.  After some wild and wooly adventures, Margaret is ready to call it quits (she lost whatever little faith she had in Jake after his plans come up short and she gets word he may be a con man), but soon Margaret finds herself in need of rescuing as she's fallen into the clutched of the nefarious Sidney (Hurt), the same man who now has her sister.  Is Jake who he claims to be, or just a flim flam man only out for personal gain?  Let's hope the former instead of the latter, for Margaret's sake...I wanted to like this film, which was mostly shot on location in Africa, a lot more than I did, but the end result felt a bit like a Wayne Crawford vanity project (Wayne not only starred in the feature, but also took co-writer and producer credits, while his partner, Andrew Lane was a writer, director and a producer).  I'm not sure if this was meant to be a parody, or a satire, but the comedy fell a bit flat (uninspired writing).  I really liked the idea of the adventure novels being based off real life escapades, but the film didn't have the `zing' to live up to its ambitions, in my opinion.  Perhaps this was a case of too few people wearing too many hats, so to speak.  Crawford was certainly handsome back in the day, sporting his David Hasselhoff perm, but he seemed to lack any real, distinctive traits to make me believe he was a hero featured in the type of books that were supposedly the result of his character's adventures.  The one thing I really noticed was the lack of chemistry between Crawford and Kopins, or even Crawford and Christopher, for that matter.  A manicured coif and a big gun do not a hero make...I thought Kopins and Christopher both did well enough (at least with the material they had to work with), and it certainly didn't hurt the fact that Kopins was just so damn attractive.  As far as Hurt, he plays his effeminately evil character over the top, for sure, but if you've read any of the novels related to in the movie, then you'll know his portrayal was in line with the villain characters depicted in the material.  Too bad Crawford didn't see fit to take his part to the hilt, living up to the character he was supposedly representing.  One aspect about the story really annoyed me and that was with regards to Speed's plan to find Margaret's sister.  He was going to use Margaret as bait, selling her off to some white slavers in the hopes that they would then lead him to their lair, where Margaret's sister was being held...the plan ended up going afoul as Margaret, who was never informed of the plan, screwed everything up as she thought Speed was actually trying to sell her off.  Afterwards Speed grouses about how his solid plan went down the tubes, but it seems to me things might have gone a lot smoother had he let Margaret in on what was going on...actually, I doubt Margaret would have gone along with the plan if she knew about it, as Speed had little idea the white slavers were the ones he was looking for, so either way, the plan was a lousy one.  One aspect I really liked was Speed's preference to do things the `hard' way, if only to make for a more interesting read in the books.  As far as the direction, it was serviceable (this was Lane's first time directing), but I felt the flow of the film stuttered quite a bit, and there were a number of scenes I thought could have been trimmed to allow for less drag time (the opening kidnap sequence was way too long, especially for a relatively inconsequential character...Margaret's sister was the impetus for the adventure, but the character was a minuscule part).  Despite those negative aspects I mentioned, I will say I thought there was a good deal of effort involved, and a real desire to entertain.  Perhaps had they gotten a different star (one who didn't have an affinity for pastel colored shirts and purple assault vehicles), shortened the running time, and threw a few more jokes in, I would have enjoyed myself a lot more.  Overall a good effort, but one that fell a little short, but then that's just my opinion, one that seems to be in the minority when compared to other reviewers.The picture, presented in widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks good on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 audio comes through well.  As far as extras, there's a two page insert that basically lays out the story of the entire feature, along with three trailers for the film, and that's it...pretty skimpy, I guess, but if you're a fan of the film, you'll probably be more pleased in the fact someone took the trouble to put out a good DVD release than disappointed in the lack of supplemental materials.Cookieman108If you're interested in a less satirical look at pulp adventure heroes, I'd suggest a film titled Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins (1985), featuring Fred Ward.  It didn't spawn the sequels as inferred within the title, but I liked it nonetheless...",3,"""Don't worry.
