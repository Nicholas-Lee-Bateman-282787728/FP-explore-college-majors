But stumbled across it by accident this year.  Susan Lucci - she's so good at what she does.  I thoroughly enjoy her in this movie and also Wendy Crew who has done so many good things in movies.  The guys who play Jake Marley and Ebbie's &#34;squeeze&#34; Paul are good additions, nice acting.  It's an all around good movie.  If you like it you might also give a look at A Carol Christmas - another update on the old story, about another Type A female who &#34;sees the light&#34;.",5,i love this movie,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,609,"['Ebbie', 'TV', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'bit', 'different', 'name', 'DVD', 'searched', 'years', 'finally', 'stopped', 'looking', 'stumbled', 'accident', 'year', 'Susan', 'Lucci', 'so', 'good', 'what', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'also', 'Wendy', 'Crew', 'who', 'done', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'movies', 'guys', 'who', 'play', 'Jake', 'Marley', 'Ebbie', '34', 'squeeze', '34', 'Paul', 'are', 'good', 'additions', 'nice', 'acting', 'all', 'around', 'good', 'movie', 'like', 'might', 'also', 'give', 'look', 'A', 'Carol', 'Christmas', 'update', 'old', 'story', 'Type', 'A', 'female', 'who', '34', 'light', '34']",Miracle at Christmas: Ebbie's Story MP3s for Christmas
