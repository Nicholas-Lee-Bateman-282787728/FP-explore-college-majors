1039952,A3OA1CBIQ275VM,B000LPS2VI,David J. Neal,"[26, 26]","Don't confuse tbis DVD with the movie ""Curious George,"" which comes in a similar DVD case. These are episodes from the far superior TV show. Not that the movie isn't worth your time and money. This is just so much more so.The product lives up to the credits: Dr. John on the swinging theme song; Ron Howard and Brian Glazer executive producing; and William H. Macy, who makes the most of any role he assumes, as narrator.There's an urban, downtown quality to these episodes, from being drawn in the manner of classic New Yorker cartoons to the jazzy soundtrack, extending even to the live action suffixes in which a group of young kids further delving into some element in the episode. Even when they're in a rural setting, you get the feeling these kids aren't suburban spawn.George comes off as a monkey-fied human preschooler, one of the many elements with which the writers have fun (one character calls George ""a city kid""). The Man in The Yellow Hat, though often in the stereotypical Long-Suffering Parent supporting role, manages to be more than a two-dimensional character. Watch these episodes and the ones that still air on PBS and you'll learn of a full cast of characters, only a couple of which could be called ""cardboard.""It's always a good morning when my daughter wants to watch, ""Monkey George.""",5,TV show trumps movie -- again,1183248000,"07 1, 2007",2007,1313,"['Do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'tbis', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Curious', 'George', 'similar', 'DVD', 'case', 'are', 'episodes', 'far', 'superior', 'TV', 'show', 'Not', 'movie', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'money', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'so.The', 'product', 'up', 'credits', 'Dr.', 'John', 'swinging', 'theme', 'song', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'Brian', 'Glazer', 'executive', 'producing', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'who', 'most', 'role', 'urban', 'downtown', 'quality', 'episodes', 'being', 'drawn', 'manner', 'classic', 'New', 'Yorker', 'cartoons', 'jazzy', 'soundtrack', 'extending', 'even', 'live', 'action', 'suffixes', 'group', 'young', 'kids', 'further', 'delving', 'element', 'episode', 'Even', 'when', ""'re"", 'rural', 'setting', 'get', 'feeling', 'kids', 'are', ""n't"", 'suburban', 'spawn.George', 'off', 'monkey-fied', 'human', 'preschooler', 'one', 'many', 'elements', 'writers', 'have', 'fun', 'one', 'character', 'George', 'city', 'kid', 'Man', 'Yellow', 'Hat', 'though', 'often', 'stereotypical', 'Long-Suffering', 'Parent', 'supporting', 'role', 'be', 'more', 'two-dimensional', 'character', 'Watch', 'episodes', 'ones', 'still', 'PBS', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'full', 'cast', 'characters', 'only', 'couple', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'cardboard', 'always', 'good', 'morning', 'when', 'daughter', 'watch', 'Monkey', 'George']",Curious George: Zoo Night and Other Animal Stories!
