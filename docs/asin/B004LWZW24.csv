A Haunted House movie that delivers what you expect yet still does its durndest to avoid cliches sounds like more than one could dare to hope for.  And Insidious comes very very close to being that good.The cast is very believable in their roles.  The chemistry between Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne is there.  These feel like a well adjusted couple with a handful of kids.  You could see this group walking through the neighborhood grocery store and buy that they are a family.  The two ghostbuster characters bring in a bit of needed comic relief, but not so much as to derail the tone of the flick.  The character of Elise does a fine job of enhancing the spooky factor. Not because she's a creepy person, simply because the information she brings to the table raise the stakes dramatically and the actress does a fine job in not going over the top in what most movies probably would have made a showier role.The movie is there to frighten you and it does a very good job with the creep out parts.  The director knows how to play an audience and he has a lot of fun trying to get you to pull that pillow you're gripping in even tighter.  I particularly enjoyed the fact that daytime was not treated like a safe haven.  The different ghosts and spirits were diverse and did well in playing with several different fears.The first hour of this movie was building up to make me believe I was dealing with a modern classic in the horror genre.  Then the third act happened.  The thing is, that last half hour isn't necessarily bad.  In fact I appreciated its attempt to go in a bit of a different direction than a normal haunted house movie.  I simply felt that the execution didn't live up to its ambition.For a fan of movies full of fright, I have no hesitation in saying it is a movie worthy of your time.

1414442,A36AWTXU52XH4C,B004LWZW24,"Amit ""Amit""","[4, 4]","As a horror fan, I always look for something that is genuinely scary (not something that turns out to be ridiculous). As many others have pointed out, Insidious is one such authentic horror movie that has all the elements of classic horror and no nonsense. Here is a summary what it has-Texture-Perfect texture and tone for a horror. Dark, at times foggy atmosphere, quiet house, spooky attic, you name it, and the movie has it all.Acting- Realistic characters, not extremists (believer female v/s non-believer male). Everyone has played their role well.Music- One of the best for horrors. perfect timing, well-balanced highs and lows, and cool jolts.Story- Very conceivable story. Everything has been explained in the movie, so you don't end up in saying WT* at the end. Of all the horror movies I have seen so far, this is the first time I have seen this concept and I liked it(its not just a haunted house or a possessed body). The script supports the story well.The director has kept everything so cohesively,that the movie neither loses its grip, nor gets boring anywhere. Wonderful flow from beginning to end!There is only one drawback I felt. The fact that the evil creatures show up in the second half of the movie slightly dilutes the overall creeepy effect. I am sure it would have been a lot more spooky if they would have adapted the Paranormal activity style (where the fear originates mainly through your imagination, not because of a scary face). I think in today's era, with so much awareness about filmmaking and advanced technology in general, its obvious for everyone to imagine that the 'ghosts' are none but artists with appropriate makeup. Hence, shadows can scare you more than the actual guy standing right in front of you. That's the only point where the movie drops a little.However, considering the fact that the crew has managed to create an authentic horror flick using all the classical elements (minus all the nonsense that is generally seen in today's movies), Insidious deserves a big applaud. It's not easy to scare people living in 2011 with the old school elements of 70's, but this movie does it, and does it in an excellent way, without compromising on any of the vital elements of a horror flick. Although I like innovations like paranormal activity, I still like to see the classical (and genuine horror). Of all the movies I have seen recently, Insidious is definitely an instant classic of the genre.

One needs to have a good surround system to truly understand what made cinema-goers so scared that it became the biggest hit of 2011 on a gross cost to net profit ratio.This is a film that is grounded in earlier films such as Ghostbusters, Poltergeist and Paranormal Activity but still has originality in terms of treatment and scares. A family moves in to a old house and needless to say that all hell starts breaking loose, at the beginning it is very discreet but the horror soon engulfs the entire family. This is the film that makes for very tense edge of the seat  because the sequences are edgy and the scares bloodcurdling owing to the novel use of sound and background music. Finally a movie that relies on direction, ambiance and music, witness the song ` Walking through the Tulips' by Tiny Tim and the piano theme by  Ludovico Einaudi  - Nuvole Bianche,rather than CGI to deliver entertainment.

I had missed this when it was in theaters and decided to just buy it and watch it.The plot follows a couple with three young children, who have just moved into a new home.  Within a day or so, the oldest son, Dalton, slips into a catatonic/coma-like state, though no reason can be found for it.  As other things begin to happen - the house alarm going off, the front door opening when it was closed and locked before, etc. - the family decides to move.  But, as the DVD cover tells you, it's not the HOUSE that is haunted.As soon as they move into the new house, doors are opening and closing on their own and records switch without anyone nearby.  Clearly, the issues are not stopping, so a psychic is contacted to explain things.The acting performances were pretty good, especially that of Rose Byrne.  She continues to be a very watchable star.  I'm not a huge fan of Patrick Wilson and I found his character quite annoying (last night, you thought someone had broken into your home, but it's okay to start working late every night now?  Nooo.) I also enjoyed Barbara Hershey in an understated performance as Patrick Wilson's mother.  The psychic, Lin Shaye, was fabulous.Overall, the story didn't wow me that much.  It worked for me in that what your mind goes to is usually much scarier than what you're being show on screen - like the original Psycho.  Less blood and guts and a better storyline are always welcome, and this movie has those.  But scary?  Not really.

1414448,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,B004LWZW24,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[3, 4]","Insidious is about a young family, Josh, Renai and their three children move into a new house. So far this sounds like any haunted house movie, but there is a few twists. Soon the oldest son of the family, Dalton, have a accident and bumps his head, the kid seams fine however and the family go to bed. The next morning Josh find Dalton lifeless in the bed, the kid have slipped into a deep coma like state which baffles the doctors. Three months later Josh and Renai get to take their son home to care for him there, and that is when creepy stuff start happening around the house.Now watching this movie you can clearly see that many of the same people that worked on Paranormal Activity also worked on this, however while the former movie worked because of subtle hints and a creepy atmosphere Insidious is about as subtle as a drunk brontosaurus being ra**d by a tyrannosaurus rex. Now I am not saying that every horror movie have to be subtle, however I do think this one had been better if it's producers had learned the lesson from Paranormal Activity that less is more. Almost immediately we have CG ghosts running around in the cupboards and demons in marks lurking in the shadows. Seeing the creatures so quickly do not ruin the movie but it do make it less scary.As a pleasant surprise about Insidious is that the movie have no gore, it is not that I mind gore, but it is great to see a horror movie lean on it's story and atmosphere rather than open wounds and rolling heads. The music in Insidious is also very good, it helps the scenes and what little scares you can find in this movie generally come from the soundtrack, that being said the movie can get very noisy at times with half a dozen people shouting, the music in the background, doors banging and the ghosts and demons doing their best to be heard over the cacophony, I do recommend having remote nearby to be able to turn the volume down in the most noisy scenes.Acting wise I think the actors did a ok job, the characters however are a mixed bag. Renai works well, the audience can sympathize with her in her plight, the group of paranormal investigators which is brought in after a while are a hoot, though their often humerus bickering is a bit out of place for the tone of the movie. Josh however do not work, I know he is supposed to be troubled but in reality he only comes off as a jerk.While watching this movie I could not decide whatever or not I liked it. The concept is good and it is not that often we see the topic of Astral Projection bought up in a horror movie so it feels rather fresh while at the same time following a tried and loved formula.

1414453,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B004LWZW24,Anticlimacus,"[1, 8]","There's a guy in my office that occasionally hides under my work desk and yells ""BOO"" when I return from the restroom. Sometimes he jumps out from the coat closet near the front door, or hides behind the wall adjacent to the office kitchen. Every time he uses the same lame ""BOO"" scream because he's too stupid to properly construct an effective scare. It worked the first few times but now it's totally worthless. He can't scare me. I, on the other hand, will occasionally hide behind his door in the morning before he arrives. His office lights are usually off and the lighting is dim. He'll walk into his office, feel someone's presence, turn around and see a shadow near the door. Is it a part of his imagination or is it real? He squints his eyes for a few seconds and then notices that someone is actually there. It scares the crap out of him every time, and I don't even need to scream ""BOO!"" Ironically, sometimes when I don't do it he'll stop by my office and say, ""Man, I thought I saw you this morning.""This very basic difference between amateur shock tactics and well-constructed sequences of terror is something that 21st Century American filmmakers ignore with reckless abandon. In case you hadn't noticed, the American horror industry has sucked for quite some time, and one major reason is that they almost always go for the cheapest, laziest routes to producing scares. In the case of Insidious, it's jump scares supplemented with 100-decibel piano/violin BOOMs. If Insidious limited itself to 2 or 3 such moments (or even 4 or 5), then it could have saved enough room for more mature, expertly crafted horror elements. Unbelievably, Insidious tosses in approximately 20 jump scares, an unacceptable descent into unprecedented laziness. The condensed nature of the jumps falls prey to the law of diminishing returns. It would be like the guy at my office jumping in front of me and yelling ""BOO"" every 3 minutes. It quickly becomes a parody of itself.Brian Salisbury from ""Film School Rejects"" makes some good points in his review of Insidious, so I'd like to quote him here: ""Seriously, horror filmmakers: put a moratorium on jump scares. I know everyone and their brother is using jump scares as a counterattack against increasingly desensitized audiences, but it's time to give up the ghost (pun only slightly intended). I got sick and tired of something popping up like Jack-in-the-Box every five seconds obscuring my vision from the much more interesting, and far scarier, story going on behind it. Jump scares are the junk food of horror films - providing only superficial and extremely temporary sensory nourishment. Soon enough, your brain is hungry again for that fear response and jump scares are about as substantial as eating a box of Twinkies on Thanksgiving Day. When you watch the Oscars and the category of Achievement in Sound Mixing comes up (you know, when you normally make a trip to the bathroom), you may ponder on the value of a film's sound mixer or sound designer. Five minutes into Insidious, you will understand the dire necessity of these artists if only by virtue of the fact that we're subjected to their spectacular failures for 90 minutes. Every apparition carries with it its own deafening shriek and every jump scare is heralded with an explosion of disharmonious (read: eardrum-shredding) violins. It seems to be operating under the same delusion as Drag Me to Hell that loud = scary. But, along with jump scares, incessant loud noises are the charlatans of fright. We are not infants, so please refrain from resorting to the same tactics that terrify barely cognitive life forms.""That sums things up nicely. The praise that Insidious has earned for it's cheap scare tactics should be concerning for fans of the genre, because a transition from the recent torture/gore trend towards jump scare compilations isn't much of a progression for the pitiable American horror industry. Take away the 100-decibel piano/violin BOOMs and almost none of the jumps will work on your mainstream cinephile. (And by ""work"" I'm using the generous term ""startle"", which is probably the laziest way to scare someone.) The storyline is stupid, the acting is mediocre at best, the dialogue ranges from decent to lame, and the dramatic elements are limp. The only true positive is the fairly brisk pacing that keeps things from getting unbearably boring.Despite everyone I know complaining about my biased preference for Japanese and South Korean horror, it's pretty damn obvious that my fellow Americans are simply too incompetent to construct long-sustained sequences of terror, produce dense atmosphere, develop interesting psychological/philosophical elements, use ambiguity properly, patiently utilize deliberate pacing to build tension, or supplement horror with good story lines and characters. If Insidious is the creme de la creme of modern American horror, then it's time to write an epitaph.",2,"Like Most 21st Century American Horror, It Goes For Cheap Scares",1311120000,"07 20,

I wasn't told it was great or extremely frightening or awesome. Sometimes feedback about a movie can leave us expecting something brilliant. This film was fun but not great. It is not original; you've seen most of this before in other scary films... but it was entertaining, especially the first part (before the seance people entered the picture).Watching this film unfold gives you the thrilling feeling that you have no idea what might happen next, or what you might see next. It gives the audience an unsettling vibe that is a vital ingredient that many horror films are sorely lacking. The first half of the movie has a deliberately slow and sinister pace and tone. It works very well. You are off guard, unsure of what to look at or what's going on.But once the pace quickens, once they start showing more than hinting at, it changes the whole mood of the thing, and that's what leaves me disappointed. Once in a while a horror film comes along with tons of potential in its start, but then things don't quite live up to the build-up. I'm reminded of another horror movie, ""Jeepers Creepers"" (2001), which  begins with such promise but then rapidly sinks into typical and predictable horror territory.""Insidious"" strikes me as a fairly effective spookshow, warts and all (some of the demons are cheesy, some of the comic relief fails).

It seemed to steal bits and pieces from other horror movies - even way back to a brief scene in Rosemary's Baby (1968).It started kinda slowly and I felt the wife wasn't worried or afraid enough of the weird things that were happening to be believeable - but that may have been a case of bad acting.SPOILER ALERT: I also thought it was a little dumb that the husband didn't lock the deadbolt on the front door but DID set the intrusion alarm and engage the little door chain after someone (unseen) knocked on the door. Inevitably, the door was open again moments later and the alarm was going off.  I guess locking it properly wouldn't keep a ghost out anyway... Still, for me, when the characters are acting like real life people would act, I find a scary movie more relatable and more scary (the old Black Christmas is still my favourite, for that reason).  When they do stupid things that no one would ever do in real life, the movie becomes just gratuitous scare tactics with no psychological component.I was pleased to see Barbara Hershey (The Entity) make an appearance here, since there were also similarities to her scary show (70's). I was wondering if she was chosen on purpose because of that.  I was half-waiting for a cameo by Bruce Willis(Sixth Sense) and JoBeth Williams (Poltergeist) since there were copycat shots from those movies, too. Someone younger is less likely to pick up on these similarities but I found them a little disappointing and distracting.Overall, an okay movie.  I probably will buy the DVD when it comes out, just because I like freezing the frame at all the scary monster scenes.  This movie had some very scary-looking characters that flashed across the screen in a burst of loud music and I enjoy seeing their costume and make-up more closely.

Starting off reminiscent of ""Amityville Horror,"" but better, it shifts tone to be more like ""The Exorcist"" later; still, it remains its own movie.  Director James Wan isn't afraid to set the camera down and let it run - not to the extent of a David Lynch, but still, after years of shakycam it's a welcome relief.  Further, it enhances the tension, because the lack of motion or cutting in some scenes makes you wonder what, if anything, is going to move on the screen.Toward the end of the second act, suddenly a team like the Lone Gunmen from X-Files, by way of Ghost Hunters, shows up.  While jarring at first, it's just off kilter enough to work and to be effective.  Tension and horror is built up effectively.  Then, the ending, however, knocks off an entire star; almost two.

You discover that they are all nice folks and are probably in the process of moving or changing schools.  Weird stuff starts to happen.  After an appropriate period of time where the skeptical family member doubts anything paranormal is happening, the experts are called in to describe what sorts of beings from ""the other side"" are afflicting the house or family.  There is a battle of some sort which is won after various travails and all appears to be well.  But it's not!  They missed something and we're left with a final creepy scene.How many horror films of the past decade or two did I just describe?  I hope you won't feel I've spoiled Insidious for you, but it's exactly the same as all the others.  There are some genuinely creepy moments (and some that just came off as silly), but the characters are cut out of cardboard and nearly the exact same plot has been done and done better.  When you use such a standard plot, something else has to set the movie apart.Let me illustrate with a parallel.  I just watched Super 8.  The plot is also rather standard and includes the ""evil military man"" trope that I typically hate.  But Abrams made me care about his characters.  They had hopes and fears and real depth.  If they had been replaced with the type of generic cereal box characters from Insidious, I wouldn't have given a damn if those prop room mannequins lived or died and the plot would not have held up to that.If you have nothing better to do with your evening or haven't ever seen a modern paranormal horror film, then Insidious is a passable by-the-numbers thriller with a few jumps.

1414481,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B004LWZW24,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 2]","Insidious was insidious in the way it started off so slowly but after a while I was totally mesmerized by it. I was just watching it, not even intending to wait until the end, but it really got me hooked. The director, James Wan, is from Malaysia, and he is perhaps best known for his work on the Saw franchise. I haven't seen them, but imagine they would be much more violent than Insidious. Wouldn't expect the director to be so subtle in drawing you into the premise.The story is about a boy and his family who move into an old house that seems to be haunted. He is exploring the attic when he falls off a ladder and into a coma. The doctors say he checks out fine, yet he is in a coma. The paranormal activity ratchets up, with the mother convinced the house is haunted, but the father skeptical at first. Reluctantly he agrees to move to another house, yet the strange occurrences don't let up. An old friend of the family, a woman named Elise Reiner, is called to help. She reveals that Dalton is a Traveler, adept at astral projection. His father is also talented in that way, but he has suppressed the memory. The boy, Dalton, is trapped in a strange dimension called Further where lost souls and demons roam, looking for vacant bodies to inhabit, such as Dalton's. If he doesn't get back soon, he could lose his body to one of the malevolent creatures intent on doing harm with it.I don't want to spoil the story, because it works best if you don't know where it is going and let yourself slowly get pulled in. Patrick Wilson plays, Josh, the father. He was Nite Owl in Watchmen, and was also in Hard Candy with Ellen Page. His part wasn't written or directed so well, as he goes from skeptic to participant so quickly it seems sudden and forced.Elise Reiner: Close your eyes, Josh. Take a deep breath and relax. With each breath, let the life around you fade into the background. Just listen to the ticking of the metronome. Focus on the spot in the center of your forehead. The universe is deathless. It is deathless because having no finite self, it stays infinite. A sound man, by not advancing himself, stays the further ahead of himself.(That last part sounds like it came from the I Ching).Patrick Wilson was adequate, and I've seen him do much better in the other roles I mentioned. Rose Byrne is the mother. She was in X-Men: First Class and Bridesmaids. She does most of the heavy lifting, acting-wise.I think the director did a great job of building tension and drawing you in. It was very realistic and believable and when all the crazy stuff started happening, I got goose bumps fur realz. This kind of story, where one must go into the underworld and bring someone back, is one of the oldest stories around. Dante's Inferno, Orpheus, Ulysses, etc. I think that once it got going, it was almost a little too straightforward. Where was the twist?But nevermind. I've said too much, and don't want to spoil anyone's suspense, or suspension of disbelief. The Bottom Line is that it had a lot of style, was subtle but certainly frightening enough once it got going. It avoided most of the cliches of films from this genre. Like, usually they stay in the haunted house even though it is obvious that's a terrible idea. Too bad moving doesn't solve the prob:Elise Reiner: It's not the house that is haunted.

This one is vaguely similar in plot, but much better, dare I say. You've undoubtedly read the basic plot from other reviews, so I'll skip to how this movie makes you feel. While watching it, when it gets to a point where the music is building and you just KNOW something is going to jump out and scare you? Well, somehow this movie manages to still frighten you to death even though you know it's coming. And there are ones you don't see coming, too.The 'villian' as it were, in the end (without giving any spoiler alerts) is the type of monstrosity that makes me of all people, the atheist, think I'd better get my ass to church REAL soon. It's one twist after another, with a strong cast, and every creepy type of ghost you can think of all rolled into one movie. (you'll never be able to listen to Tiny Tim again either without getting creeped out, I guarantee) And it's not bloody or gory. It'll just mess with your head and make you very afraid of the dark.The cool thing that I read on IMDB about it was that the writer sat at his desk writing this movie with a bulletin board of horror movie cliches in front of him, making sure he didn't hit any of the overused horror movie moments.

1414489,A1JZZLIVXGJSIB,B004LWZW24,CinemaMinor,"[0, 0]","First, I'm so glad I waited until I could stream this via a rental rather than a permanent purchase.  ""Insidious"" is definitely scary/creepy/unsettling from the very first shots; despite this, something was bugging me about the movie.  About 45 minutes in I realized what it was: there is no story.  The creepiness has nothing to do with the narrative, but rather the camera work and scoring -- this is quite common these days.  However this particular movie is presented as if there is going to be a meaningful narrative.  A musician mother and teacher father and their three young children move into a house paneled with lots of dark oak .  It is said that ""things are going to be better"" now that they've moved, hinting at previous problems. These problems are perhaps connected to the mother's unhappiness; she is very grateful that her husband is allowing her to focus on her music full-time now.  Still, it's apparent that she doesn't feel he's really helpful enough.  Has there been marital strife?After a few nights in the house, the oldest son is in a coma that confounds medical experts and the house is full of unexplained disturbances.  After about three months, the mother is insistant upon moving.  Her chronically detached husband agrees so they do, and find themselves still ""haunted"" by whatever it was that was tormenting them in the first house.  It isn't until the family moves into this second home that there is any glimpse of a tangible story.  Unfortunately for ""Insidious,"" that story is ""Poltergeist"" -- without the depth.The only element that is introduced in the beginning of ""Insidious"" that is carried through is the fact that the father doesn't like to have his picture taken.  What previous problems did the family have?  Who knows.  Instead, the paternal grandmother is introduced and we enter what seems like a whole different movie.  All that was frightening about it to begin with is lost as it unravels into ridiculousness.  And it can't be said enough how derivative the story is of ""Poltergeist.""  ""Poltergeist"" isn't necessarily scary, but it has that thing about it that elevates a mediocre horror movie to the realm of the iconic: a point.  At its center, ""Poltergeist"" is about the hippie generation grappling with the ""greed is good"" mentality of the 1980's -- a commentary on capitalism, traditional values, etc.  There is no such subtext in ""Insidious.""To give an example of how little ""Insidious"" focuses on a script or story continuity, the grandmother is supposed to be watching the other 2 kids while a supernatural rescue team tries to save the boy in a coma (i.e., bring his soul back to his physical being).  There is no mention of her having a husband, of there being a grandfather.  In fact, despite the family's earlier problems, despite this woman's grandson needing round the clock medical care, we don't see this character the entire first half of the movie.  Yet when they call her to the house she runs right over in a matter of minutes so she's clearly nearby -- unless the father got a new teaching gig and they up and moved across the country.  And now that the grandmother is participating in the festivities, the other kids are with whom?  But she needs to be there because any substantive story the movie has is based on the grandmother's dialogue; about 80 minutes in, she (with the aid of the leader of the supernatural rescue team) explains to the audience what the reason for all the ghosts, demons, and creepiness is. That's how exciting it is -- straight-up exposition.At this point, the movie is not scary.  It is silly.  Rose Byrne (mother), Patrick Wilson (father), Barbara Hershey (grandmother), et al can't be faulted for empty performances since they had so little with which to work.  Suddenly, the sick boy's freaky drawings which have been on his wall for months and are freaky regardless of what has subsequently been revealed have meaning!  We never find out why the family moved into the first new house to begin with.  If there were problems in their previous home, it can only be assumed, but then why would the mother feel moving a third time would make it any better?  And although the ending is supposed to represent a twist, I figured it out, as I think many people would given that these movies always end with a twist and there aren't many directions in which to go here.So, ""Insidious"" is scary in the beginning, but in the same way walking through a haunted house is scary because you are literally following the camera turning the set into a haunted house. A dark realm is explored toward the end, but by that point I personally couldn't stop comparing the ways in which the movie was like -- and not as good as -- ""Poltergeist.""  The movie stops being engaging just at the point it's really supposed to get intense.  Bottom line: it really needed more of an original story, and that story really needed to be integral to more of the movie, not just the second half of it.",3,Scary in a haunted house type way,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,4968,"['First', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'waited', 'could', 'stream', 'rental', 'rather', 'permanent', 'purchase', 'Insidious', 'definitely', 'scary/creepy/unsettling', 'very', 'first', 'shots', 'something', 'was', 'bugging', 'movie', '45', 'minutes', 'realized', 'what', 'was', 'story', 'creepiness', 'nothing', 'do', 'narrative', 'rather', 'camera', 'work', 'scoring', 'quite', 'common', 'days', 'However', 'particular', 'movie', 'presented', 'going', 'be', 'meaningful', 'narrative', 'musician', 'mother', 'teacher', 'father', 'three', 'young', 'children', 'move', 'house', 'paneled', 'lots', 'dark', 'oak', 'said', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'better', 'now', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'hinting', 'previous', 'problems', 'problems', 'are', 'perhaps', 'connected', 'mother', 'unhappiness', 'very', 'grateful', 'husband', 'allowing', 'focus', 'music', 'full-time', 'now', 'Still', 'apparent', ""n't"", 'feel', 'really', 'helpful', 'enough', 'Has', 'there', 'been', 'marital', 'strife', 'few', 'nights', 'house', 'oldest', 'son', 'coma', 'medical', 'experts', 'house', 'full', 'unexplained', 'disturbances', 'three', 'months', 'mother', 'insistant', 'moving', 'chronically', 'detached', 'husband', 'so', 'do', 'find', 'still', 'haunted', 'was', 'was', 'tormenting', 'first', 'house', ""n't"", 'family', 'second', 'home', 'glimpse', 'tangible', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'Insidious', 'story', 'Poltergeist', 'depth.The', 'only', 'element', 'introduced', 'beginning', 'Insidious', 'carried', 'fact', 'father', ""n't"", 'like', 'have', 'picture', 'taken', 'What', 'previous', 'problems', 'did', 'family', 'have', 'Who', 'Instead', 'paternal', 'grandmother', 'introduced', 'enter', 'what', 'whole', 'different', 'movie', 'was', 'frightening', 'begin', 'lost', 'ridiculousness', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'enough', 'how', 'derivative', 'story', 'Poltergeist', 'Poltergeist', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'scary', 'thing', 'mediocre', 'horror', 'movie', 'realm', 'iconic', 'point', 'center', 'Poltergeist', 'hippie', 'generation', 'grappling', 'greed', 'good', 'mentality', '1980', 'commentary', 'capitalism', 'traditional', 'values', 'etc', 'such', 'subtext', 'Insidious', 'give', 'example', 'how', 'little', 'Insidious', 'script', 'story', 'continuity', 'grandmother', 'supposed', 'be', 'watching', 'other', '2', 'kids', 'supernatural', 'rescue', 'team', 'tries', 'save', 'boy', 'coma', 'i.e.', 'bring', 'soul', 'back', 'physical', 'being', 'mention', 'having', 'husband', 'being', 'grandfather', 'fact', 'family', 'earlier', 'problems', 'woman', 'grandson', 'needing', 'round', 'clock', 'medical', 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'character', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'when', 'call', 'house', 'right', 'over', 'matter', 'minutes', 'clearly', 'nearby', 'father', 'got', 'new', 'teaching', 'gig', 'up', 'moved', 'country', 'now', 'grandmother', 'participating', 'festivities', 'other', 'kids', 'are', 'whom', 'be', 'there', 'substantive', 'story', 'movie', 'based', 'grandmother', 'dialogue', '80', 'minutes', 'aid', 'leader', 'supernatural', 'rescue', 'team', 'audience', 'what', 'reason', 'ghosts', 'demons', 'creepiness', 'how', 'exciting', 'straight-up', 'exposition.At', 'point', 'movie', 'not', 'scary', 'silly', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'mother', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'father', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'grandmother', 'et', 'al', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'faulted', 'empty', 'performances', 'had', 'so', 'little', 'work', 'Suddenly', 'sick', 'boy', 'freaky', 'drawings', 'have', 'been', 'wall', 'months', 'are', 'freaky', 'regardless', 'what', 'subsequently', 'been', 'revealed', 'have', 'meaning', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'family', 'moved', 'first', 'new', 'house', 'begin', 'were', 'problems', 'previous', 'home', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'assumed', 'then', 'why', 'would', 'mother', 'feel', 'moving', 'third', 'time', 'would', 'make', 'better', 'ending', 'supposed', 'represent', 'twist', 'figured', 'out', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'given', 'movies', 'always', 'end', 'twist', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'directions', 'go', 'here.So', 'Insidious', 'scary', 'beginning', 'same', 'way', 'walking', 'haunted', 'house', 'scary', 'are', 'literally', 'following', 'camera', 'turning', 'set', 'haunted', 'house', 'dark', 'realm', 'explored', 'end', 'point', 'personally', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'comparing', 'ways', 'movie', 'was', 'like', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Poltergeist', 'movie', 'being', 'engaging', 'just', 'point', 'really', 'supposed', 'get', 'intense', 'Bottom', 'line', 'really', 'needed', 'more', 'original', 'story', 'story', 'really', 'needed', 'be', 'integral', 'more', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'second', 'half']",Insidious

Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a bit of blood in my horror movies, but I love just good old fashioned creepy stories that don't rely on excessive carnage & violence to get you creeped out.I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie and my husband and I both came away thinking it was pretty darned good.The premise is a young couple who move into a large home with their infant and two young sons.  Things start to happen in the house and the family decides the house has got to be haunted, as their are strange sounds, and it seems there are others in the house when there isn't anyone there.  One of the sons begins to draw strange and demonic pictures and he writes that he seems himself sleeping and then flies away.  The makings of a unique imagination or something else????  The mother is so unnerved but the unexplained things that she is experiencing that she is more than happy to ditch the grand house for a much smaller one to start fresh.  Early on the one son, who has been making the strange drawings is exploring and finds his way to the attic and the creaky old ladder snaps a rung and Dalton falls and hits his head.  Things seem ok until the next day when his father cannot wake him and they go to the hospital.  The doctors cannot explain it, he is not in a coma, but he is not in a wakeful state either, he is in limbo and they don't know when/if he will come out of it.  He returns home with a hospital-type setup and is fed through a tube and they wait..... Meanwhile strange things begin to happen in the new house, enough that they begin to think that this house too is haunted....doors that were locked open, a record played changes to a tune that is not on the album being played, people start to see figures and hobby horses rock on their own.The movie is spooky and then when you find that the son is actually the haunted one, it is strangely compelling-A psychic and her crew of two come to check out the house and see what they may be able to do to help rid the home and the couple's son of their demons.I enjoyed the spooky chills, the creepy cinematography and the plotline.Overall, a good movie if you like a good old fashioned scare.",4,All the scares without all the blood & guts.....,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,2292,"['Somewhere', 'line', 'horror', 'movies', 'went', 'atmospheric', 'spooky', 'tales', 'blood', 'guts', 'fests', 'order', 'get', 'scared', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'bit', 'blood', 'horror', 'movies', 'love', 'just', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'creepy', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'rely', 'excessive', 'carnage', 'violence', 'get', 'creeped', 'out.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'lot', 'movie', 'husband', 'came', 'away', 'thinking', 'was', 'pretty', 'darned', 'good.The', 'premise', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'move', 'large', 'home', 'infant', 'two', 'young', 'sons', 'Things', 'start', 'happen', 'house', 'family', 'house', 'got', 'be', 'haunted', 'are', 'strange', 'sounds', 'are', 'others', 'house', 'when', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'there', 'One', 'sons', 'draw', 'strange', 'demonic', 'pictures', 'sleeping', 'then', 'away', 'makings', 'unique', 'imagination', 'something', 'else', 'mother', 'so', 'unnerved', 'unexplained', 'things', 'experiencing', 'more', 'happy', 'ditch', 'grand', 'house', 'much', 'smaller', 'one', 'start', 'fresh', 'Early', 'one', 'son', 'who', 'been', 'making', 'strange', 'drawings', 'exploring', 'way', 'attic', 'creaky', 'old', 'ladder', 'rung', 'Dalton', 'falls', 'head', 'Things', 'seem', 'ok', 'next', 'day', 'when', 'father', 'can', 'not', 'wake', 'go', 'hospital', 'doctors', 'can', 'not', 'explain', 'not', 'coma', 'not', 'wakeful', 'state', 'either', 'limbo', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when/if', 'will', 'come', 'home', 'hospital-type', 'setup', 'fed', 'tube', 'wait', 'Meanwhile', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'new', 'house', 'begin', 'think', 'house', 'too', 'haunted', '.doors', 'were', 'locked', 'open', 'record', 'played', 'changes', 'tune', 'not', 'album', 'being', 'played', 'people', 'start', 'see', 'figures', 'hobby', 'horses', 'rock', 'own.The', 'movie', 'spooky', 'then', 'when', 'find', 'son', 'actually', 'haunted', 'one', 'strangely', 'compelling-A', 'psychic', 'crew', 'two', 'come', 'check', 'out', 'house', 'see', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'help', 'rid', 'home', 'couple', 'son', 'demons.I', 'enjoyed', 'spooky', 'chills', 'creepy', 'cinematography', 'plotline.Overall', 'good', 'movie', 'like', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'scare']",Insidious

The makers of Paranormal Activity and Saw do very well with this great horror film. It's pg-13, but it works here. No blood, gore, torture porn stuff to be found anywhere! The torture is all psychological...a thinking person's horror film. The musical score is excellent....pretty original...not that teen slasher cheesy long chase music. LOL! I really appreciate the old school ""less is more"" approach that the first part of the film provides. Extremely atmospheric and the tension is sometimes unbearable. Then...comes the second part. We have the comic relief of the two paranormal investigators (one is the writer, Mr. Winell). Thankfully, their boss (Lynn Shaye) is dead serious. I LOVE that woman! A lot of ppl seem turned off by the explanation about the projection, but I thought it was very original and it took me by suprise. This movie is the first movie I have seen that deals with that stuff. And I'm interesting in OBE; even got a beginner's book on it. Well, after seeing this movie, I shall burn the book! LOL..j/k. I give the movie 4 stars instead of 5 because the final scenes were cheesy with the Night of the Living Dead demons bursing into the house like they did. And that one last twist....lol...typical hollywood ""sequal?"" ending. And then there's Darth Maul...this time with hooves and a tail...and a snake like flicking tounge. He was VERY scary in this movie as the main demon, but couldn't the makers have been more original and not insult George Lucas like that? Granted, they did Maul justice by giving him a truly evil presence in this movie, but I would've prefered a completely original monster.In conclusion, Insidious is a slow burning atmospheric horror flick suitable for teens and above. Plenty of jump scares, great tension throughout, excellent music, descent acting, and truly terrifying imagery. Just don't except the second half to live up to what the first half promises.

Their son falls into a ""coma"" and the very skinny and frail wife of his starts hearing things in the house, and seeing people wander about preparing to do untold wicked things. They react well, by moving to a different house. But, alas, the house wasn't the problem. Their son was the one that is haunted. Dun DUN DUN!!!I felt that the acting was poor, but the story was pretty good. I've never acted before, so I don't know. Maybe they all won academy awards for this film. There's a scene at the beginning where our young leading lady comes down the stairs wearing her footy pajamas. It took me a minute to figure out she was the wife, and not the teenage daughter. Grow up and buy some slippers. She also somehow carries her baby around. Looking at her arms reminded me of prisoners from Buchenwald or Auschwitz. She gives her son a feeding tube, but I hope she took a couple hits off of it first.Our fearless dad, does an absolutely terrible job of reacting to a possible intruder in his house. He wanders around like he's looking for his car keys, and seems relatively unconcerned that his front door keeps opening itself. He does a little better later in the film, and I'm sure his career is safe. As I was washing windows with a dirty newspaper near the on ramp I thought, good for him. He's making money doing what he loves, just like me.These acting (and dieting) flaws aside, the film is pretty good.

However, there is one sub-genre, when executed correctly, that can give me the shivers:  ghost stories.  While insidious involves more than ghosts, I feel it definitely falls into this category.  I've spoken to many people who didn't think this movie was scary at all.  Maybe it depends on your state of mind when you see it.  I saw it in the theater and I was completely creeped out.  The atmosphere, sound, and imagery (produced with a minimal budget) in the film cut me to the core.  It's some spooky stuff!  Many also saw the film as a rehash of Poltergeist.  I can see the parallels, but I didn't notice them when I first saw the film and, anyway, I still think Insidious stands on its own.

1414500,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004LWZW24,C. Sawin,"[3, 6]","The first Saw film will always be something I fondly look back on. While the film had its fair share of bad acting and ridiculousness, that final twist just made everything worthwhile. Seeing it in theaters was something special, too. The snickering and the whispering amongst friends during the sillier parts of the film were silenced as Jigsaw revealed himself and the audience collectively picked their jaw up off the floor as a wave of silence washed over everyone. The downside is that director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell haven't really been able to capture that same sense of astonishment since. Death Sentence was a nice change of pace while Dead Silence left something to be desired, but both seemed to lack that key ingredient that kicked the feet out from under audiences like Saw did. Insidious looked to have potential even though most horror films about paranormal entities seem to fall flat on their face. While Insidious probably couldn't be considered the best film to be released this year, it's certainly still one worth seeing in theaters.Insidious thrives on music cues and cheap scares. Fairly intricate orchestral pieces that are very string heavy are used periodically throughout the film while at other times noticing the lack of music usually leads one to expect something to jump out at them at any given moment. Nearly all of the scares are like that though with creepy ghosts and creatures jumping out at you when you least expect it. The opening felt like it took up half the film. We see an old woman holding a candle followed by the title screen with a string arrangement turned up to 25 even though the initial volume only goes to 10 and then we waltz through what feels like the longest opening credit intro in history. We're shown black and white stills while the cast and crew are listed up on screen. The film seems to keep this pace the first half of the film. It's incredibly slow moving; a creak in the floorboards here, a door moans as it opens by itself over there, and then the payoff is something silly like a ghost dancing to silly music. In addition to the first half being slow, it felt incredibly anticlimactic and was unintentionally funny most of the time. I found myself being more interested thinking about what the key Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne) wore around her neck could possibly open rather than being absorbed in the events taking place on screen. Thankfully, the film picked up a bit in the second half.One of the main drawing points of Insidious is that it's by the same people that made both Saw and Paranormal Activity. That's an interesting note as the first half of the film is very similar to Paranormal Activity if it was shot with conventional movie cameras instead of a home video camera. The second half seems heavily influenced by both Ghost Hunters and Poltergeist. The film's creativity lies within its introduction of ""The Further"" concept. Once we're shown that world and the evil entities seeking a vessel to come into ours, it feels like the film can finally begin; but it's bittersweet. It doesn't take long for the film to delve into familiar territory before closing on a predictable finale. The most devastating of the evil entities introduced in the film can best be described as the love child between Darth Maul and a faun. It was also kind of ironic hearing Patrick Wilson give that superhero speech since Wilson will probably be known best for his role as Nite Owl in Watchmen. Insidious does have a few intriguing surprises up its sleeve though. The main ones being when Specs (Leigh Whannell) is trying to get Dalton (Ty Simpkins) to follow his voice while Elise (Lin Shaye) wears that crazy looking gas mask and the other one being when we're thrown into the realm of The Further. The way that's filmed along with the bizarre events that unfold there will probably make that scene the one you remember the most after you leave the theater.Despite the film's many flaws, it's still recommended that you see Insidious in theaters. Why, you may ask? Seeing a film like this in a packed theater is something special. That atmosphere is incredible. While the film may not make you jump, it's entertaining to watch and hear how it affects everyone else around you. The comments people make under their breath and hearing some of the guys scream like little girls is something that just won't be the same if you choose to wait to watch it in the comfort of your own living room. It's the type of film you take a date to even though you know they hate horror films because they're going to be grabbing all over you throughout the film. Also, I don't think I've laughed at anything this hard all year. So maybe Insidious is entertaining for all the wrong reasons, but at least it's still entertaining.Insidious is an entertaining theatrical experience, but will probably lose most of its steam once it hits DVD and Blu-ray. The way it not only relies on jump out scares, but practically uses them as a crutch during moments of building tension will probably get old really fast to most viewers familiar with the horror genre. Throw in the extremely loud music and the film probably seems a bit more clich&eacute; than it actually is. Not to mention it feels like it takes forever for the film to find its footing. While Insidious does offer a few moments of genuine originality, it doesn't take long for those moments to take that detour into predictability. James Wan and Leigh Whannell do have some talent buried down in there somewhere, but it feels like they've yet to find their stride as bona fide filmmakers. See Insidious with a group of friends or a mostly full theater. Otherwise skip it altogether.",3,"Amusing theatrically, but probably dull in the comfort of your own home",1301616000,"04 1, 2011",2011,5695,"['first', 'Saw', 'film', 'will', 'always', 'be',

You'd think that The Lord's name would be utilized here to help save this young boyand his family. Instead, the name of Christ is only used for blasphemy. Typical. No Bibles, no prayers.However, we do get a couple of bumbling 3rd rate ghost busters who appear quite useless. But then Ibelieve that would be the comedy relief of this silly film.Now I do realize that this film is only fictional. But when it comes to demonic possession, there shouldbe certain qualities that have some sense of reality based in fact. And I can tell you all that read thisreview is that demons are too real. And Bill Murray will never solve your problem. If there was apossitive note to all this, some of the quick scares were well imagined. And hey, having Tiny Tim do ""Tip ToeThrough The Tulips""?? It just doesn't get scarier than that.Anyway, I put this film on the high stinker level. And if any of you out there find yourself, or family member,being possessed by a demon, grab a Bible and call a Godly man.

1414507,A3U7ELIED4WP4R,B004LWZW24,Dark Faerie Tales,"[4, 6]","The Review:From the makers of Paranormal Activity 1 and 2 comes a new horror movie, Insidous, starring Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne.  The Paranormal Activity people have not lost their touch and Insidious is an excellent example of how to make a scary movie without having to overly rely on creating a gorefest. Rather, Insidious opts for creating and sustaining tension, playing the audience masterfully.  You'll jump just when Insidious` creators want you to jump and you'll scream just when they want you to scream. Watch it in the right frame of mind and with a good audience and you'll be creeped out.As with Paranormal Activity, Insiduous takes the haunted house genre and combines it with the demon possessed child genre, a la Omen and the Exorcist. It throws in a pinch of A Nightmare on Elm Street and the result is something unique and extremely entertaining for devotees of the horror genre. It's clever and offers important new wrinkles for how our protagonists are supposed to deal with their situation.  One can move out of a haunted house, but one cannot easily move away from a haunted family member.Insidous centers around the Lambert Family: Josh, Renai, Dalton and Foster.  At first there's nothing about this family that marks them as abnormal, but as things progress it becomes clear that there is a very dark cloud hanging over them.  As with the folks in Paranormal Activity, the classic signs of a house haunting begin when the Lambert family moves into their new home.  Things move around, strange noises come out of the baby monitor and shadows seem to have a life of their own.  Mom, and the kids seem to notice these things first and Dad is determined to rationalize away these strange happenings.  Things progress to a point that even Josh cannot deny the evidence any longer.  Without giving too much away, there are indeed supernatural forces at play and they have not settled upon the Lambert clan by mere chance.Insidious succeeds because you are on the same journey of discovery as the Lambert family.  You learn alongside them answers to the question, why them? And the further you go, the more insidious their problems appear, hence the film's title.  Another winner from the makers of Paranormal Activity.  If you are easily creeped out, then think twice about this seeing this movie.  While nothing will ever creep me out as much the little girl from The Ring, Insidous left me leaving on an extra light or two around the apartment, and very thankful that I don't live in a creepy old house.FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.",4,Deep Sleep,1302652800,"04 13, 2011",2011,2573,"['Review', 'makers', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '1', '2', 'new', 'horror', 'movie', 'Insidous', 'starring', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'people', 'have', 'not', 'lost', 'touch', 'Insidious', 'excellent', 'example', 'how', 'make', 'scary', 'movie', 'having', 'overly', 'rely', 'creating', 'gorefest', 'Rather', 'Insidious', 'opts', 'creating', 'sustaining', 'tension', 'playing', 'audience', 'masterfully', ""'ll"", 'jump', 'just', 'when', 'Insidious', 'creators', 'want', 'jump', ""'ll"", 'scream', 'just', 'when', 'want', 'scream', 'Watch', 'right', 'frame', 'mind', 'good', 'audience', ""'ll"", 'be', 'creeped', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Insiduous', 'haunted', 'house', 'genre', 'combines', 'demon', 'possessed', 'child', 'genre', 'la', 'Omen', 'Exorcist', 'pinch', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'result', 'something', 'unique', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'devotees', 'horror', 'genre', 'clever', 'important', 'new', 'wrinkles', 'how', 'protagonists', 'are', 'supposed', 'deal', 'situation', 'One', 'can', 'move', 'out', 'haunted', 'house', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'easily', 'move', 'away', 'haunted', 'family', 'member.Insidous', 'centers', 'Lambert', 'Family', 'Josh', 'Renai', 'Dalton', 'Foster', 'first', 'nothing', 'family', 'abnormal', 'things', 'clear', 'very', 'dark', 'cloud', 'hanging', 'folks', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'classic', 'signs', 'house', 'haunting', 'begin', 'when', 'Lambert', 'family', 'moves', 'new', 'home', 'Things', 'move', 'around', 'strange', 'noises', 'come', 'baby', 'monitor', 'seem', 'have', 'life', 'own', 'Mom', 'kids', 'seem', 'notice', 'things', 'first', 'Dad', 'determined', 'rationalize', 'away', 'strange', 'happenings', 'Things', 'progress', 'point', 'even', 'Josh', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'evidence', 'longer', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'are', 'indeed', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'play', 'have', 'not', 'settled', 'Lambert', 'clan', 'mere', 'chance.Insidious', 'are', 'same', 'journey', 'discovery', 'Lambert', 'family', 'learn', 'alongside', 'answers', 'question', 'why', 'further', 'go', 'more', 'insidious', 'problems', 'appear', 'hence', 'film', 'title', 'winner', 'makers', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'are', 'easily', 'creeped', 'out', 'then', 'think', 'twice', 'seeing', 'movie', 'nothing', 'will', 'ever', 'creep', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'little', 'girl', 'Ring', 'Insidous', 'left', 'leaving', 'extra', 'light', 'two', 'apartment', 'very', 'thankful', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'creepy', 'old', 'house.FTC', 'Advisory', 'purchased', 'own', 'tickets']",Insidious

These kind of movies are becoming more and more popular these days...you know the formula, 45 minutes of doors slamming unexplainably, dishes or other household items flying across the room or falling off shelves, strange voices being heard from upstairs, blurry or shadowy figures seen in windows or dark areas of hallways. Then there's the last 45 minutes where it gets more intense and things actually start happening. Overall, this method has proven effective and enjoyable.Concering the technicle specs on the movie I have no complaints. The Blu Ray picture quality and sound on this movie is crisp and clear. The extras on the disc are worth watching.Overall, I enjoyed this movie. I just had a tough time with the way the last 30 minutes went. It really dragged the movie down.

1414523,A3V7K5L1134ZO3,B004LWZW24,Dr. Sparkles,"[2, 3]","I had heard good things about Insidious which led me to this purchase.  Atmospherically, the movie is eerie which is fantastic.  It's that feeling you get when you are all alone in your house and the house keeps making weird noises and you get sort of paranoid.  Basically, the movie is about a family with three kids that are living in a house which they believe is haunted.  Things just escalate and one of the little boys goes into an unexplainable coma.  They move, thinking the house carried the evil, but actually they carry it with them when they go.  As time goes on, and the little boy stays comatose, the family invites a couple of goofy investigators in and a hardcore psychic.  It seems the little boy is able to astrally project himself during sleep so his soul separates from his body.  At some point, the two did not connect again and his soul is out there somewhere floating around while his body is pretty much empty.  The empty body is a breeding ground for evil things that are looking to take it over, namely a red-faced demon that likes to terrorize.  The astral projection also has a link to the boys father and it becomes a quest to save the little kid's soul.  My honest opinion is that this was a new idea, which is always good in horror.  Something different to be seen rather than the same old song and dance.  However, it got so out of control and ridiculous that it fell apart.  At first the demons slam doors and mess with a baby monitor and you see glimpses of them like behind a drape for instance.  But then it just turned silly and the demon was like a small boy who ran around and the story just lost its atmosphere so quickly.  Once you see like a solid figure and hear these obviously clear voices, it just takes on that Hollywood appearance again and the subtleties that made it creepy start to suffer.  Also, the outlandish investigators and the psychic with this gas mask looking thing did not help the movie at all.  Please, one of the guys had this contraption that looked like a scope at a proctologists office and he was inserting Viewmaster cartridges into it. Dumb. The first half is so promising - it was really creepy to me when the little boy Dalton was being taken care of at home and you could here that monitor beeping in the dark - I kept expecting him to half raise out of bed and look up with black eyes or something.  I felt really sorry for little Logan who obviously saw the things creeping around the house at night.  I was kind of hoping the demon was going to take that cranky little girl who kept crying every seven seconds.  She was giving me a headache.

1414525,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B004LWZW24,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 2]","A family moves into a new home, and spooky things start happening. Eventually they realize the truth -- they are being haunted by a malevolent supernatural force.It's a plot so common that it has become a cliche, but there is still some creative juice to be squeezed from it -- and in &#34;Insidious,&#34; it scares the pants off you. James Wan (the guy who gave us the original &#34;Saw&#34; and &#34;Dead Silence&#34;) crafts a slow, eerie drift through a ghostly nightmare, which is only flawed because sometimes it feels like he's throwing every single scary thing imaginable into it.Renai and Josh Lambert (Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson) have just moved into a lovely new house with their three children, and everything seems fine.... until their son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) falls into a coma, and the doctors don't know why. Then weird things start happening -- Dalton's brother reveals that Dalton sleepwalks through the house every night, faces appear in the windows, and a mysterious specter attacks Renai.So they do the sensible thing: move to a new house. But then Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) spots a horrifying figure lurking near Dalton's body, and they realize that whatever was haunting them before has followed them.So Lorraine calls in an old psychic friend, Elise (Lin Shaye); Josh believes that she's just a fraud, but she soon shows that she can detect the Darth Maul-looking creature that is haunting Dalton. It turns out that Dalton's soul is lost in a spiritual in-between zone that Elise calls The Further -- and if they don't save him soon, something terrible will steal his body.In a lot of ways, &#34;Insidious&#34; reminds me of &#34;Poltergeist&#34; -- a family, a new home, a terrifying ghostly presence that is stalking a gifted child, and a parent who is forced to go into an &#34;in between&#34; death dimension. And like &#34;Poltergeist,&#34; this movie takes well-worn ghost story cliches and makes them scary once more... just by doing them really well.Even before the spooky stuff begins, director James Wan gives the movie an eerie atmosphere. Every scene is full of pale grey light, with lots of empty shadowy rooms and sudden bursts of loud wild sound (including &#34;Tiptoe Through the Tulips,&#34; which is terrifying enough). And he gives you the feeling that something is lurking in the corner just out of sight -- something cold and hungry, something utterly merciless. Even worse, it's not alone.Gradually, Wan builds up a sense of building horror, throwing in glimpses of dead-faced men, gas masks, and finally a venture into the Further itself. This is basically everything that James Wan finds terrifying -- a hellish, eerie dimension filled with the grinning puppet-like dead, victrolas piping eerie music, and a demon who looks like a Darth Maul minotaur. It doesn't sound scary, but it will have you clawing the arms of your chair.The only problem with the Further is... well, it feels like Wan flung every single scary thing he could come up with into the Further, without much of a plan. It's wildly effective on a visceral level, but it leaves you wondering how some parts of it (the laughing kid, for instance) gel together with Darth Maul Demon.Sympathetic characters in horror movies are about as common as frogs who can do algebra, so it's refreshing that... well, pretty much everybody in this movie is likable. While Josh seems insensitive at times, it's gradually revealed that there's a reason why he shies away from all things supernatural, and Patrick Wilson really gives a powerful, intense performance as a guy desperate to save his son, yet resistant to what could save him.Byrne is at the other end of the spectrum -- Renai is crumbling slowly under the constant onslaught of specters and scares, and Byrne captures her raw terror for her family. Shaye and Hershey give solid performances as well... and my only complaint is that the baby is ALWAYS crying.With excellent direction and a very talented cast, &#34;Insidious&#34; is a haunting ghost story that builds up to visceral, nightmarish terror -- and while the horror seems random sometimes, it's still very effective.",5,Insidiously spooky,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,4154,"['family', 'new', 'home', 'spooky', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'Eventually', 'realize', 'truth', 'are', 'being', 'haunted', 'malevolent', 'supernatural', 'force.It', 'plot', 'so', 'common', 'become', 'cliche', 'still', 'creative', 'juice', 'be', 'squeezed', '34', 'Insidious', '34', 'pants', 'James', 'Wan', 'guy', 'who', 'gave', 'original', '34', 'Saw', '34', '34', 'Dead', 'Silence', '34', 'crafts', 'slow', 'eerie', 'drift', 'ghostly', 'nightmare', 'only', 'flawed', 'throwing', 'single', 'scary', 'thing', 'imaginable', 'it.Renai', 'Josh', 'Lambert', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'have', 'just', 'moved', 'lovely', 'new', 'house', 'three', 'children', 'everything', 'fine', 'son', 'Dalton', 'Ty', 'Simpkins', 'coma', 'doctors', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Then', 'weird', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'Dalton', 'brother', 'reveals', 'Dalton', 'house', 'night', 'appear', 'windows', 'mysterious', 'specter', 'attacks', 'Renai.So', 'do', 'sensible', 'thing', 'move', 'new', 'house', 'then', 'Josh', 'mother', 'Lorraine', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'spots', 'horrifying', 'figure', 'lurking', 'Dalton', 'body', 'realize', 'was', 'haunting', 'followed', 'them.So', 'Lorraine', 'old', 'psychic', 'friend', 'Elise', 'Lin', 'Shaye', 'Josh', 'just', 'fraud', 'soon', 'can', 'detect', 'Darth', 'Maul-looking', 'creature', 'haunting', 'Dalton', 'out', 'Dalton', 'soul', 'lost', 'spiritual', 'in-between', 'zone', 'Elise', 'Further', 'do', ""n't"", 'save', 'soon', 'something', 'terrible', 'will', 'steal', 'body.In', 'lot', 'ways', '34', 'Insidious', '34', 'reminds', '34', 'Poltergeist', '34', 'family', 'new', 'home', 'terrifying', 'ghostly', 'presence', 'stalking', 'gifted', 'child', 'parent', 'who', 'forced', 'go', '34', '34', 'death', 'dimension', '34', 'Poltergeist', '34', 'movie', 'well-worn', 'ghost', 'story', 'cliches', 'scary', 'once', 'more', 'just', 'doing', 'really', 'well.Even', 'spooky', 'stuff', 'director', 'James', 'Wan', 'movie', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'scene', 'full', 'pale', 'grey', 'light', 'lots', 'empty', 'shadowy', 'rooms', 'sudden', 'bursts', 'loud', 'wild', 'sound', 'including', '34', 'Tiptoe', 'Tulips', '34', 'terrifying', 'enough', 'feeling', 'something', 'lurking', 'corner', 'just', 'sight', 'something', 'cold', 'hungry', 'something', 'utterly', 'merciless', 'Even', 'worse', 'not', 'alone.Gradually', 'Wan', 'up', 'sense', 'building', 'horror', 'throwing', 'glimpses', 'dead-faced', 'men', 'gas', 'masks', 'finally', 'venture', 'Further', 'basically', 'everything', 'James', 'Wan', 'terrifying', 'hellish', 'eerie', 'dimension', 'filled', 'grinning', 'puppet-like', 'dead', 'victrolas', 'piping', 'eerie', 'music', 'demon', 'who', 'Darth', 'Maul', 'minotaur', ""n't"", 'sound', 'scary', 'will', 'have', 'clawing', 'arms', 'chair.The', 'only', 'problem', 'Further', 'well', 'Wan', 'flung', 'single', 'scary', 'thing', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'Further', 'much', 'plan', 'wildly', 'effective', 'visceral', 'level', 'wondering', 'how', 'parts', 'laughing', 'kid', 'instance', 'together', 'Darth', 'Maul', 'Demon.Sympathetic', 'characters', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'as', 'common', 'frogs', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'algebra', 'refreshing', 'well', 'pretty', 'much', 'everybody', 'movie', 'likable', 'Josh', 'insensitive', 'times', 'gradually', 'revealed', 'reason', 'why', 'away', 'things', 'supernatural', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'really', 'powerful', 'intense', 'performance', 'guy', 'desperate', 'save', 'son', 'yet', 'resistant', 'what', 'could', 'save', 'him.Byrne', 'other', 'end', 'spectrum', 'Renai', 'crumbling', 'slowly', 'constant', 'onslaught', 'specters', 'scares', 'Byrne', 'raw', 'terror', 'family', 'Shaye', 'Hershey', 'give', 'solid', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'complaint', 'baby', 'ALWAYS', 'crying.With', 'excellent', 'direction', 'very', 'talented', 'cast', '34', 'Insidious', '34', 'haunting', 'ghost', 'story', 'visceral', 'nightmarish', 'terror', 'horror', 'random', 'sometimes', 'still', 'very', 'effective']",Insidious
1414526,A3A8P8IBH7L1WW,B004LWZW24,Edward,"[2, 11]","""It's not the house that's haunted,"" the ads tell us, and how right they are. It's ""Insidious"" that's haunted by every possessed-by-another-world melodrama ever made. Even people who seem to like this misfire confess they recognize it as a hodgepodge of ""The Exorcist"" and ""Poltergeist"" with a little ""The Shining"" thrown in. That professional critics (granted, of the radio variety) could have found something admirable here gives you a pretty scary idea of today's critical standards. The ten-thumbed direction is by James Wan, who has sawed his way through half a dozen pieces of low-grade lumber, and his screenplay is by Leigh Wannell, the producer/writer of what is commercially called the Saw franchise. This ill-conceived plot concerns a young couple with three kids who, moving into a new house, are disturbed by all sorts of specters and strange occurrences. It gets so bad they buy another house; and how Dad manages to casually buy various houses on a teacher's salary is not explained. As it turns out, the second house is spooky too, so of course they consult an expert in the paranormal.  (Actually, these houses don't need ghost busters so much as they need a can of three-in-one: you've never heard so many squeaky doors in all your life.) It seems the couple's young son, who's supposedly in a coma, is really out among the ghoulies on ""the other side"" and must be rescued by his father, who has been there himself as a boy. Derivative? Well, yes, there's even a visual reference to the steak scene in ""Poltergeist"". Suspenseful? Not at all.

I am super picky and take nothing in life as it comes without looking at it from all angles. I can usually tear apart a movie within minutes of watching it. My friends hate watching movies news or TV shows with me because I don't miss a beat, I see all mistakes and holes instantly. But the reason I am doing a review on this movie is because In my opinion it really kicked ass but then again its only my opinion. I would have changed very little, a few things I would have changed is when the kid appeared in the second house when he changed the music and started dancing it killed the creepiness of the mood. He should have just been standing in front of the record player after he changed the music. Then when she tracked him down the way he jumped out of the cabinet kind of killed the mood the bad acting kind of threw me off. Then when the family who was shot by the smiling girl showing the act of the murders happened it kind of killed the mood and pace again you could tell they where trying too hard to weird you out. Other than that this movie gets on to a fast moving pace and doesn't stop and the spirits start showing up right away. I love the concepts and idea's in this movie the astral projection seemed really interesting to me. It may be a hodge podge of a few other movies but they did a good job at what they put together and don't take to much from single film in the past. It seems like the 1st half of the movie is much scarier than the second and it seemed like it became hard for the director to finish off such an excellent 1st half. Now my point here is I have been through hell in real life and the fear in my brain has vanished after being so terrified in my life, coming close to death many times over and over again until my fears finally vanished. But this movie really creped me out and had me looking over my shoulder in my place after I finished watching it. This movie made me feel alive again lol. What I really liked is it was a blind watch, I knew nothing of the movie before I viewed it. This will be a day one blu ray buy for me.

1414530,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B004LWZW24,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 0]","A young family begin to experience supernatural occurrences and their young son, Dalton, who never recovered from a minor accident and is in a mysterious coma, appears to be the centre of this strange phenomenon. A medium is called in and it is discovered that Dalton, has the ability to astral project and travel to another realm, which is referred to as ""The Further"" and is somehow lost and may be in the company of a monstrous entity. His empty, soul-less body, has become an open vessel for other worldly creatures who are wanting to live again, and will possess his body if the sleeping boy's soul is not returned soon.It has been stated that this film bears a resemblance to the classic Tobe Hooper film, ""Poltergeist"" (1982). Let's see.  Both films deal with supernatural activity tormenting a young family with the phenomenon concentrating on one of the children. Both films have a child lost in another dimension,  ""The Further"" (Insidious) or ""The Other Side"" (Poltergeist, although this term wasn't used until the sequel). Both children are in the company of a monstrous evil. Both films have a team of parapsychologists called in to try and establish contact and return the child to this world. Both films have a parent travel to another dimension to reclaim their child. The similarities appear endless. However, visually, the 2 movies look nothing alike. ""Poltergeist"", in my opinion, is superior. Hooper's classic is very Special Effect's heavy and has a lot more on screen action, with floating phantasms, supernatural whirlwinds, exploding coffins and many corpses on display, not to mention, it also had heart and a funny bone. ""Insidious"" really has none of the above, and this films tone is much more darker. Comparisons aside, ""Insidious"" has a lot of atmosphere and there are some real sinister scenes. You do see some surreal characters and images during the last quarter of the film and the performances are good. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne who play the tormented couple, John and Renai Lambert, are good, although Josh, at times, was kind of loopy (more on this a bit later). I also loved seeing the beautiful Barbara Hershey again as Lorraine, Josh's tormented mother who also has a secret of her own to tell. The film is more psychological, relying more on atmosphere and tense situations for its chills, and some of the make-up effects are frightening (the main demon resembles Darth Maul a bit too much). The score is a bit creepy, although it could get a bit grating if you sit through the end credits, almost like nails on a chalk-board.Some of the scenes are a bit of a let-down. **Possible Spoilers** When Josh is shown ghostly pictures from his childhood, the apparition in the photos are just too in-your-face to the point that they look photo-shopped. Images that were less obvious would have been far more successful. Also when ""The Further"" is finally visualized, it is much too dark to see anything clearly and the ghosts/souls inhabiting this realm are quirky and rather pathetic, aside from the main demon, they do not appear at all that frightening, and I have to admit, the main demon lost it's frightening edge once I realized it likes to listen to Tiny Tim. Josh also appears to be a bit mindless in the latter parts of the film and is not able to follow important instructions all too well. A medium explicitly tells him that he is travelling to another realm and to NOT DRAW ATTENTION to himself because if they (meaning the evil creatures that reside there) realize he is not one of them, they will come for his ""physical body in this world"" yet once there, he starts screaming at the top of his lungs ""Dalton!!!, Dalton!!!..Followed by ""Where is my son? .. Tell me where my son is, please! .. Have you seen my son!??"" and then initiates a fight with, none other than a parasitic and powerful entity and screams at it - `What do you want from me?..I am not scared of you ... Get away from me.. Leave me alone!!"" . Really? Dude, really? You fail.""Insidious"" moves along surely but slowly and there really is minimal action here and when the action does start during the all too important climax, it is much too dark to see any of it. With that said, I do appreciate this film and would love to see more of this type of horror releases since for the past decade, we have been given far too many slasher movies and torture porn.

They prove that, in capable hands, a horror film doesn't have to be gory or use lame special effects to garner some scares.Although some have scoffed at the film's premise, stating ""been there, done that"", I think that Insidious takes some measures to separate itself from the typical ghostly, supernatural tale. It's a film that might not appeal to the horror/slasher crowd that must see copious amounts of gore--decapitations, body parts flying around, victims being hacked, extended periods of human torture, etc. While Insidious isn't exactly subtle either, the film definitely builds its frights and spookiness from the terrors of being possessed and the unknown entities that exist.  There are those moments when Dalton lay in bed motionless while unearthly things begin to happen. There's also a sense of dread as the spirits (or some may say, demons) come closer and closer to the Lambert family. In one sense, it is the ""there isn't something quite right with this house"" tale with some disturbing things happening in the family home, but, as we see later in the film, it explores another, scarier realm outside of the haunted house theme.Not to say there weren't issues. The film gets a little over the top and silly at points as in the film's final segments. There's quite an emphasis for Wan to let us know exactly when we should feel scared, with the creepy music provided as a cue, almost a little too much.Problems aside, though, Insidious is an effective, well-developed, creepy film that uses atmosphere and building tension to give viewers genuine scares.

1414537,A39C2BQXZHOUMJ,B004LWZW24,G. Dowling,"[3, 3]","A film like ""Insidious"" makes it look easier than it is for most filmmakers.  It's, at its core, an old-school ghost story done with such modern flair . . .from everything to writing, acting, casting, score, cinematography, sound, and special effects, that it leaves me to wonder why more filmmakers can't make horror films this superbly.  I am a jaded horror fan.  Horror fans are like drug addicts...we keep chasing the cherry high.  ""Insidious"" by description sounds like a story we have seen a thousand times.  Young couple buys first house, nice kids, lots of high hopes for the future, all of which is wrecked by a pesky haunting.  ""Insidious"" takes these tired ingredients and gives them more than a facelift...it has set a new bar for this sub-genre.  Patrick Wilson (Little Children, Hard Candy) and the lovely Rose Byrne (TV's ""Damages"", ""Get Him to the Greek"", ""Knowing"") star as the young, idealistic couple, Josh and Raneigh, who find themselves plunged into a nightmare when they come to believe their house is haunted and means them harm as their 7 year old son ends up in an unexplained coma after a ghost encounter. Josh's mother (played by the aging ever gracefully Barbara Hershey) brings in a psychic to investigate (another cliche), but what again, sets this apart is the panache brought to the character by Lin Shaye, a terrific character and stage actress.  She believes Dalton (the little boy) is a gifted astral-projector who has ventured too far away from his body.  I won't explain more so as not to spoil the twists, but the ensuing action is as terrifying as movies get.  Director James Wan, who cut his teeth on the original ""Saw"", infuses the films with energy, tension and unbearable suspense.  My heart was pounding through most of the film.  Did I mention there is a rather terrifying demon lurking about the house?""Insidious"" was made on a shoestring budget of only $1 million.  You would never know it in looking at the value per dollar on the screen.  First-rate actors, superb art direction and special effects, it looks like a $40 million film.  This gave Wan tremendous freedom to make the movie he wanted to make and the results are truly unnerving.  The movie has an uncommon intelligence...this is a couple that actually talks to each other and believes each other, where lesser movies hang the plot on this communication not happening.  I especially liked the fact that after a few incidents at their first home, they move.  This usually harkens the end of the film.  Instead, to the sickening realization of our characters and we the audience, the ghosts follow them, as it is not the house which is haunted, but the boy.  The characters make logical decisions making them easy to indetify with and enormously likable.  It helps to have actors of Wilson and Byrne's caliber.  I was riveted to this film, and if you're a fan of ghost stories, especially those which rely on atmosphere, story and suspense over blood and guts, you will be richly rewarded and long haunted even after the credits roll.  This is superior film, well worth purchasing.  I recommend the Bluray version strongly to see the nuanced details in the art direction and the perfect replication of the original photography.  Extras are light, which is disappointing, but the film more than makes up for it.*Also available on Netflix streaming.",5,An updated version of an old-fashioned ghost story,1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,3356,"['film', 'Insidious', 'easier', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'core', 'old-school', 'ghost', 'story', 'done', 'such', 'modern', 'flair', 'everything', 'writing', 'acting', 'casting', 'score', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'special', 'effects', 'wonder', 'why', 'more', 'filmmakers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'horror', 'films', 'superbly', 'am', 'jaded', 'horror', 'fan', 'Horror', 'fans', 'are', 'drug', 'addicts', 'keep', 'chasing', 'cherry', 'high', 'Insidious', 'description', 'sounds', 'story', 'have', 'seen', 'thousand', 'times', 'Young', 'couple', 'buys', 'first', 'house', 'nice', 'kids', 'lots', 'high', 'hopes', 'future', 'wrecked', 'pesky', 'haunting', 'Insidious', 'tired', 'ingredients', 'more', 'facelift', 'set', 'new', 'bar', 'sub-genre', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'Little', 'Children', 'Hard', 'Candy', 'lovely', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'TV', 'Damages', 'Get', 'Him', 'Greek', 'Knowing', 'star', 'young', 'idealistic', 'couple', 'Josh', 'Raneigh', 'who', 'find', 'plunged', 'nightmare', 'when', 'come', 'believe', 'house', 'haunted', 'harm', '7', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'up', 'unexplained', 'coma', 'ghost', 'encounter', 'Josh', 'mother', 'played', 'aging', 'ever', 'gracefully', 'Barbara', 'Hershey', 'psychic', 'investigate', 'cliche', 'what', 'again', 'apart', 'panache', 'brought', 'character', 'Lin', 'Shaye', 'terrific', 'character', 'stage', 'actress', 'Dalton', 'little', 'boy', 'gifted', 'astral-projector', 'who', 'ventured', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'body', 'wo', ""n't"", 'explain', 'more', 'so', 'not', 'spoil', 'twists', 'ensuing', 'action', 'as', 'terrifying', 'movies', 'get', 'Director', 'James', 'Wan', 'who', 'cut', 'teeth', 'original', 'Saw', 'films', 'energy', 'tension', 'unbearable', 'suspense', 'heart', 'was', 'pounding', 'most', 'film', 'Did', 'mention', 'rather', 'terrifying', 'demon', 'lurking', 'house', 'Insidious', 'was', 'made', 'shoestring', 'budget', 'only', '1', 'million', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'looking', 'value', 'dollar', 'screen', 'First-rate', 'actors', 'superb', 'art', 'direction', 'special', 'effects', '40', 'million', 'film', 'gave', 'Wan', 'tremendous', 'freedom', 'make', 'movie', 'wanted', 'make', 'results', 'are', 'truly', 'unnerving', 'movie', 'uncommon', 'intelligence', 'couple', 'actually', 'other', 'other', 'where', 'lesser', 'movies', 'hang', 'plot', 'communication', 'not', 'happening', 'especially', 'liked', 'fact', 'few', 'incidents', 'first', 'home', 'move', 'usually', 'end', 'film', 'Instead', 'sickening', 'realization', 'characters', 'audience', 'ghosts', 'follow', 'not', 'house', 'haunted', 'boy', 'characters', 'make', 'logical', 'decisions', 'making', 'easy', 'indetify', 'enormously', 'likable', 'have', 'actors', 'Wilson', 'Byrne', 'caliber', 'was', 'riveted', 'film', ""'re"", 'fan', 'ghost', 'stories', 'especially', 'rely', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'suspense', 'blood', 'guts', 'will', 'be', 'richly', 'rewarded', 'long', 'haunted', 'even', 'credits', 'roll', 'superior', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'recommend', 'Bluray', 'version', 'strongly', 'see', 'nuanced', 'details', 'art', 'direction', 'perfect', 'replication', 'original', 'photography', 'Extras', 'are', 'light', 'disappointing', 'film', 'more', 'up', 'available', 'Netflix', 'streaming']",Insidious

It is very tricky to make a horror film because part of being a man is to never admit you are scared and all that false bravado. This is why men giggle at the movies.

You can tell a good horror film from a bad horror film when the film is three steps ahead of your voice of reason.

Although the longer the movie goes on the scares start to dwindle until the ending which I thought I could predict, but it was two steps ahead of me and provided a nice chilling twist.So in the beginning one of the kids is comatose in a bedroom and the mom is starting to suspect there's a supernatural element in effect, while the dad is dismissing everything as ridiculous. Rose Byrne is excellent by the way, she was great in Bridesmaids and she's great in this, I hope to see her in more roles. Before the ghost specialists or whoever come into the picture the movie is at it's scariest, I don't remember feeling such a chill down my spine after hearing Tiny Tim in this movie (well before Darth Maul is listening to it).The ghost specialists are called into the job, one sweet old psychic lady and her two assistants which look like two Mormon hipsters. They're kind of played for comic effect but the scares were still present and the story ups the ante a bit. After that though the dad goes in the 'ghost world', and lots of people didn't like this bit. I didn't mind it however, it was mysterious and the smiling family bit was pretty creepy, but when the dad got in a fist-fight with a ghost that was pretty damn stupid. The ending where the dad finds his son held captive by darth maul that was kind of a dumbed down chase scene as well.The director and writers know how to maintain atmosphere and tension very well, which is kind of a rarity these days in horror. So while that was good the ending was dumbed down to a fist fight, I don't know if it was an argument with the producers about the final act or something but it just felt jarring after such a good 2/3rds that some really dumb decisions were made near the end. The VERY ending twist though was great.Even though it's really not that great a movie it is a refreshingly old fashioned chiller of a horror movie, perfect for Halloween time.",4,Spooky,1336176000,"05 5, 2012",2012,2060,"['normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'scared', 'PG-13', 'movies', 'last', 'one', 'did', 'was', 'Signs', 'Insidious', 'had', 'freaked', 'out', 'parts', 'was', 'very', 'refreshing', 'longer', 'movie', 'scares', 'start', 'dwindle', 'ending', 'thought', 'could', 'predict', 'was', 'two', 'steps', 'ahead', 'provided', 'nice', 'chilling', 'twist.So', 'beginning', 'one', 'kids', 'comatose', 'bedroom', 'mom', 'starting', 'suspect', 'supernatural', 'element', 'effect', 'dad', 'dismissing', 'everything', 'ridiculous', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'excellent', 'way', 'was', 'great', 'Bridesmaids', 'great', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'roles', 'ghost', 'specialists', 'whoever', 'come', 'picture', 'movie', 'scariest', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'feeling', 'such', 'chill', 'down', 'spine', 'hearing', 'Tiny', 'Tim', 'movie', 'well', 'before', 'Darth', 'Maul', 'listening', 'ghost', 'specialists', 'are', 'called', 'job', 'one', 'sweet', 'old', 'psychic', 'lady', 'two', 'assistants', 'look', 'two', 'Mormon', 'hipsters', ""'re"", 'kind', 'played', 'comic', 'effect', 'scares', 'were', 'still', 'present', 'story', 'ante', 'bit', 'dad', ""'ghost"", 'world', 'lots', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'bit', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'however', 'was', 'mysterious', 'smiling', 'family', 'bit', 'was', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'when', 'dad', 'got', 'fist-fight', 'ghost', 'was', 'pretty', 'damn', 'stupid', 'ending', 'where', 'dad', 'son', 'held', 'captive', 'darth', 'maul', 'was', 'kind', 'dumbed', 'chase', 'scene', 'well.The', 'director', 'writers', 'know', 'how', 'maintain', 'atmosphere', 'tension', 'very', 'well', 'kind', 'rarity', 'days', 'horror', 'So', 'was', 'good', 'ending', 'was', 'dumbed', 'down', 'fist', 'fight', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'argument', 'producers', 'final', 'act', 'something', 'just', 'felt', 'jarring', 'good', '2/3rds', 'really', 'dumb', 'decisions', 'were', 'made', 'end', 'VERY', 'ending', 'twist', 'was', 'great.Even', 'really', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'refreshingly', 'old', 'fashioned', 'chiller', 'horror', 'movie', 'perfect', 'Halloween', 'time']",Insidious

However it was disappointing in that the acting/directing/screenwriting was not good. Where do I begin? First this was not based on any kind of real story or events (not that that is essential to a good film but it might have lent more depth and reality to a poor script), which to me would have made it more interesting. Second, some of the actors (the high tech paranormal investigators and their psychic colleague ) act as though this is routine which doesn't seem to be realistic. Do they go through this every week? And,  after all, many real people would have had many troubles after witnessing such events most especially fear and terror, stress and possible psychological problems. But even more objectionable is this psychic who seems to know it all. I have studied real life possessions in Malachi Martin's(former Jesuit exorcist at the Vatican) book Hostage to the Devil . This movie seems to be completely ignorant of demonic possession and exorcism. One priest makes one entrance in the story and then is shown the door.Then the battle against the demons takes place with high tech and a &#34;great&#34; psychic. Not once is the word 'God' mentioned. All real exorcisms have priests, rabbis, ministers casting demons out in the name of God/Jesus. Here we have confident , arrogant people with no clue battling against Demons/Satan. Religion is never really mentioned. There seems to be a strong tendency to avoid any mention of spirituality, faith, prayer, religion in the battle against evil.Seems ridiculous that the traditional weapons against evil have been expunged and replaced with pride and ego. It is really sad in our modern secular society to see how bigoted film makers are in being close minded to spirituality and religion. These film makers should have studied the classic movie &#34;The Exorcist&#34; and/or done some research into real life accounts.

Running Time: 1 hour, 42 mins.The Lambert family have moved into a two-story house. The house has nice wood inside. Like all horror movies, their is something creepy in this house. It starts with making noise in the attic. Renai (Rose Byrne) can't find anything wrong in the attic, but it is eerie like a presence is there. Dalton (Ty Simpkins) goes up in the attic to play. Up on a ladder, he tries to reach the string to the light. The  presence is closer to him, but we can not see it. Suddenly, his parents downstairs in the living room hear him scream. He had quite a fall with a wound on his forehead. They put him to bed. The camera pans to the window.The next morning, Josh (Patrick Wilson) tries to wake Dalton up. He is still. He is not responding. They take him to the hospital. The doctor (Ruben Pla) tells them he is in a coma.At home, Renai is listening to the baby monitor. Strange sounds are in the baby room. It becomes the voice of a man. Suddenly, it yells ""I want it"". Renai jumps up and runs to the baby's bedroom. The baby is upset, but no one is in the room. Dalton is in his own bed still in the coma. Foster (Andrew Astor) hears the house making noise and he says someone walking in the hallway is bothering him. He wants to change rooms.Twenty-six minutes into this movie, I was getting the creeps and it reminded me ofParanormal Activity 2(2010). I wanted to turn it off and go to bed, but I can't. I'm scared. Have to continue watching this.Renai can't stand it in the house anymore. She wants to movie to a new house. And so they do.The new house has more sunlight and appears to be cheerful. Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) is Josh's mother. She is there to help them move in and give comfort.  When Renai is alone, the creepy stuff happens again. Now she sees the haunted people again. Later, Lorraine admits to seeing the Indian guy in the corner of Dalton's room.They decide to bring in some paranormal help. Specs (Leigh Whannel) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) can find the ghosts. They also bring in Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) who has the most experience.Option of subtitles: English and Spanish.Special Features: Horror 101: The Exclusive Seminar (10 mins.)On Set with Insidious (8 mins.), Insidious entities.Patrick Wilson and Ty Simpkins have work together before inLittle Children(2006).Barbara Hershey has dealt with ghosts before.

The story is familiar to any fan of classic horror movies. A happy family moves into a new house, and weird stuff starts to happen--books appear where they don't belong, odd noises emanate from the attic, apparitions appear and disappear. And then one of the sons lapses into a mysterious coma. The wife/mother (played by an appropriately distraught Rose Byrnes) implores her husband (Patrick Wilson) to move--she insists that the house is haunted. He acquiesces and they move to a new home, only to find that the haunting continues. For a brief time after the move to the new home, ""Insidious"" looks as if it's destined to become a contemporary horror classic, reminiscent of ""Poltergeist."" But then there's a fateful scene involving a gas mask, and the movie rapidly goes downhill. The remaining 30 minutes or so of the film focuses on astral projection and other dimensions, and ""Insidious"" seriously loses its way. The ending telegraphs an almost inevitable sequel, which I'm sure will be a disappointment.

At all the right times, in all the right places, the scares and thrills are there.  Sure, it's a hodge-podge of Poltergeist, Exorcist and Paranormal Activity, but each aspect of those movies is accentuated to produce a genuinely frightening combination.After a family of five moves into a new home, it takes little time to realize something is wrong.  Items move, doors close.  When one child falls into a coma and the mother hears what sounds like Vin Diesel growling in some Gaelic dialect over the baby monitor, it's time to move despite the fact the father is a disbeliever.  Unlike the Jefferson's, moving on up doesn't work for this family and the frights return like ghost herpes.While creative license was necessary to move the story along, the astral plane concept is not completely embraceable.  Nonetheless, the rest of the movie hits on all cylinders.  Visually there isn't a lot, but what is presented works very effectively.  All the scare techniques (e.g. eerie noises, well chosen music accompaniment, quiet-to-loud shocks, quick reveal scares) are expertly crafted and executed.  Epic timing on more than one occasion.  None of the actors really stand out, and a few (a Ghostbusters reproduction) were somewhat silly, but Lin Shaye must be recognized for her interesting performance as a medium who ties the entire movie into a sleep-stealing knot.Impressed from beginning to end by this movie, I applaud the return to old fashioned, suspenseful horror that doesn't need a teenage sacrifice in a brothel, hostel, or abandoned building.  Not saying I dislike those, but Insidious is good for the change of pace.  The second half of the film is much slower than the terrifying first half, but if you've recently asked yourself, ""Whatever happened to the slow build up?""

1414567,A106016KSI0YQ,B004LWZW24,Jay Dickson,"[4, 4]","You've got to hand it to director James Wan: he not only knows what scares you, he can also present it absolutely beautifully. Best known for SAW, the granddaddy of the so-called ""torture porn"" subgenre, in INSIDIOUS he presents an absolute minimum of gore to show that the best sense of film-going dread can come not from what the screen shows you but what it resists showing you: there are gorgeous tableaux of the successive homes of the main characters, Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne), where you stare concertedly at the quiet complex interior compositions trying to figure out if something is hidden within looking back at you. (And sometimes there is.) The film involves the Lamberts' eldest son, Dalton, lapsing into an unexplained coma after which mysterious spectral visitations come to the Lamberts' enormous home; after they move to a smaller house to escape the ghosts, the hauntings mysteriously continue, requiring them to turn to Josh's mother (the always welcome, if here underused, Barbara Hershey) for further aid.The film is so excitingly paced and has such heartstopping compositions (such as the pre-credits sequence of a camera moving through a hallway, concluding its movement when it stops to rest on a spectral face staring back) that it seems to have everything it needed to join the ghost movie pantheon with such classics as A TALE OF TWO SISTERS and the original version of THE HAUNTING. What it misses is subtext: we never have enough sense of the Lamberts as a family to understand their larger emotional problems... or, for that matter, how they can afford an enormous multi-story baronial house filled with what look to be priceless antiques. (It's certainly not on Josh's salary as a schoolteacher; but if it's on Renai's income as a composer, why is this never explained? And why would a family with three small children have so many fragile antiques so precariously displayed?) The screenplay just isn't up to the level of the superlative direction and cinematography.

It was slow.  The filmmakers tried to set up the characters, showing the mom play the piano and the dad at work and stuff but and nothing scary happens.  We understand later that it's the boy's comma that sets off the chain of scary moments and that's fine, but they could have cut all this 'normal everyday living' and got right to the comma within the first 5 minutes.Also, I found that the filmmakers should have placed the scares in the movie in different order.  We start off by having one big scare, followed by little scares like the door creaking open and a rocking horse rocking by itself, when they should have put the little scares first, built tension then put the big scares at the end.But the last hour, wow.  It's a good thing I didn't turn it off because the story made me keep on watching.  People are complaing about the last 20 minutes, but the movie cost just a million dollars to make.

Now, years have passed and Josh has his own family.  Josh, along with his wife Renai (Rose Byrne) and their three children have moved into a new home.  Everything is fine for a while until the oldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) suffers a fall in the attic.  After the fall, Dalton slips into a coma.  The trouble is that the doctors cannot explain why he is in the coma.After Dalton's fall, Renai begins seeing strange apparitions and hearing noises.  Josh, while somewhat skeptical, believes his wife and, thinking that somehow the house is haunted, the family moves a new home.  Although settled in their new home, the mysterious apparitions and noises didn't disappear with the move.  Soon, Josh, Renai, and the children are running out of options.  With seemingly nowhere else to turn, Renai enlists the help of a trained psychic (Lin Shaye) to determine the problem.  Upon her investigation, she determines that Dalton has the ability of astral projection, and his spirit has been corrupted by evil and he's now imprisoned in a dimension known as ""The Further"".  Only Josh, himself also able to astral project, can save his son from the demons who wish to possess him.  Will he succeed before its too late?This is an excellent movie.  There's no blood and gore here, only truly terrifying psychological terror.  The story line is well-conceived, and the acting is very good.

This is any horror writer/director's wet dream, whatever the nay sayers may write.  He uses his obvious talent with puppets to maximum effect, lifting the rather mundane plot (a child hits his head and falls into something that is not quite a coma, but something else) and transforms it into a truly terrifying film. Wan is an uneven talent who often cashes in, but he was taking things quite seriously with this one.Patrick Wilson (always great at playing a creepy man in whatever he's in) and Rose Byrne (a phenomenal actress judging from this) are a couple with a secret they don't know about: their son's (and husband's) talent for astral projection, a fancy term for those who have the talent for leaving their own bodies.  As soon as their son Dalton (child actor Ty Simpkins) falls into his semi-non-coma, some really screwy things begin to happen around the household.What makes this film so frightening on a visceral level is that Wan is unafraid to turn the whole ordeal into a derangement of perception almost immediately.  You really can't trust anybody except Rose Byrne's character.  When Wilson's character Josh goes into the astral plane to save his son, that's when this film reaches the real great creative heights--it is like something out of the fiction of Arthur Machen, Algernon Blackwood, take your pick.

After about an hour, this potential scary classic delves into the realm of stupidity. It's as if the writer sat down and fell in love with the concept....and then let it get away from them. Like many of the reviews here, I completely agree the scares should be about what you DON'T see.

1414582,A2CTJY3BTQXF06,B004LWZW24,JL,"[1, 1]","After reading some other reviews, I have to agree that this is very nearly a ""Poltergeist"" remake.  There are some variations (ie, being trapped via astral projection as opposed to being snatched by ghosts), but it is quite similar.One reviewer indicated he almost peed his pants watching this film.  Thankfully, that didn't happen to me (*grin*), although I will admit to some goose flesh at a couple of spots when the special effects were particularly creepy.  The film begins very slowly and then finally picks up the pace.  Once things got going, it was entertaining.  The main reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the very slow beginning and the ending.  I generally dislike movies that end without a happy resolution and without the bad guys getting their comeuppance.  In fact, I seriously hate that.  This movie has a similar type of ending, which I found very annoying.  I know it's pat, but I just prefer the tidy resolution where everything is right with the world again.***Potential Spoiler Alert***I also found myself really detesting the father in the movie, as he seemed like a complete idiot.  I mean, why go to all of the trouble to astrally project himself and fist-fight a ghost (seriously?) in order to find his lost son, only to stupidly separate from said son and squander valuable time feebly screaming at a ghost in the mirror??  And before astrally projecting, the dad was resoundingly warned NOT to draw attention to himself.  Yet, the second he reaches The Further, he meanders all over the place stupidly and repeatedly yelling ""HELLO?!"" as loudly as possible.  That's about as subtle as driving your car on the sidewalk.  So by the end of the movie, I was ready to thrash the father myself.Anyway, this isn't a terrible film or the stupidest movie I've ever seen, as some reviewers have stated.  It's entertaining for a one-time viewing, but probably isn't something I'll ever watch again.PARENT ALERT: As for the rating (PG-13), it does have some pretty scary moments that I wouldn't want my kids to watch, as well as some swearing--most notably one F-bomb, along with several religious exclamations.",3,"Creepy moments, but a bit annoying",1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,2132,"['reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'agree', 'very', 'nearly', 'Poltergeist', 'remake', 'are', 'variations', 'ie', 'being', 'trapped', 'astral', 'projection', 'opposed', 'being', 'snatched', 'ghosts', 'quite', 'similar.One', 'reviewer', 'indicated', 'almost', 'peed', 'pants', 'watching', 'film', 'Thankfully', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'will', 'admit', 'goose', 'flesh', 'couple', 'spots', 'when', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'particularly', 'creepy', 'film', 'very', 'slowly', 'then', 'finally', 'up', 'pace', 'Once', 'things', 'got', 'going', 'was', 'entertaining', 'main', 'reason', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'very', 'slow', 'beginning', 'ending', 'generally', 'dislike', 'movies', 'end', 'happy', 'resolution', 'bad', 'guys', 'getting', 'comeuppance', 'fact', 'seriously', 'hate', 'movie', 'similar', 'type', 'ending', 'found', 'very', 'annoying', 'know', 'pat', 'just', 'prefer', 'tidy', 'resolution', 'where', 'everything', 'right', 'world', 'again', '***Potential', 'Spoiler', 'Alert***I', 'also', 'found', 'really', 'detesting', 'father', 'movie', 'seemed', 'complete', 'idiot', 'mean', 'why', 'go', 'trouble', 'astrally', 'project', 'fist-fight', 'ghost', 'seriously', 'order', 'find', 'lost', 'son', 'only', 'stupidly', 'separate', 'said', 'son', 'squander', 'valuable', 'time', 'feebly', 'screaming', 'ghost', 'mirror', 'astrally', 'projecting', 'dad', 'was', 'resoundingly', 'warned', 'NOT', 'draw', 'attention', 'second', 'Further', 'place', 'stupidly', 'repeatedly', 'yelling', 'HELLO', 'as', 'loudly', 'possible', 'about', 'as', 'subtle', 'driving', 'car', 'sidewalk', 'So', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'ready', 'thrash', 'father', 'myself.Anyway', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'film', 'stupidest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'entertaining', 'one-time', 'viewing', 'probably', ""n't"", 'something', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'watch', 'again.PARENT', 'ALERT', 'rating', 'PG-13', 'have', 'pretty', 'scary', 'moments', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'kids', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'swearing', 'most', 'notably', 'one', 'F-bomb', 'several', 'religious', 'exclamations']",Insidious

1414591,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B004LWZW24,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[2, 2]","Insidious is an independent horror film from director James Wan; one of my personal favorite directors who also directed Saw and Death Sentence. Insidious is slightly different from other haunted house films because it's not the house that's haunted. It's not a big change to the genre, but at least it attempts to create something different. Insidious mixes tension with jump-out scares. When I originally watched it in theaters (with mixed expectations because of the Paranormal Activity marketing and James Wan directing), most of the scares were original and unexpected so I left satisfied. The first two acts of the film are terrifying and amazing. I have mixed feelings about the last act when they enter what is called ""The Further"". Although it changes the pace of the film and isn't as scary as the first half, it's still manages to be creepy. Consequently, I enjoyed the film overall. The acting was fine, the music was great, and the scares were often original and creative.Insidious is an amazing horror film worth watching with an open mind. Go in with low expectations, and you'll possibly leave surprised. I highly recommend watching Insidious.

If it weren't for the last twenty minutes and the subsequent, exhausted 'twist' ending, this would be a really solid film.Young Dalton Lambert goes into a medically inexplicable coma. His family searches for answers. Weird things happen. A psychic is consulted. More weird things happen. That's the movie with the major twists and revelations unrevealed.Wan and Whannel get a lot of productive mileage out of showing little and suggesting a lot, of quick scares and odd things lurking in the outskirts of the frame. The cosmology introduced by the psychic to explain what's going on makes a certain amount of sense, though it's not developed enough to be all that convincing for long. A visual homage to Neil Gaiman's Sandman series is a bit jarring; that one supernatural entity looks an awful lot like Darth Maul undercuts a certain amount of tension.Rose Byrne is a stand-out as the worried mother. Byrne's face in repose tends to look sad anyway -- I think it's her eyebrows -- and the look suits the material. Patrick Wilson is fine as the father, who has supernatural secrets of his own, though he appears to lose about 50 IQ points in the last twenty minutes. When the psychic tells you not to draw attention to yourself, don't run around yelling at every supernatural entity you encounter, that's all I've got to say.The movie also joins the horror sub-sub-sub-genre of 'Monsters who love novelty songs,' as one entity really likes Tiny Tim's ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips,"" which was already terrifying enough on its own.

1414596,A2DP4GQ4LAP3MK,B004LWZW24,Justin Elswick,"[3, 5]","I agree with most critics and audiences that INSIDIOUS had some genuinely nerve-wracking moments. The tension and dread are very nicely wound up as the movie progresses, and the supernatural aspects are very ""realistic"" in that they are subtle and in shadow--like things you could actually imagine happening.  The sequence involving the house alarm going off at night is perfectly pitched and will have you stressed and on edge. There are several legitimate ""gotcha"" moments that rattle your nerves. The acting is top-notch (esp. Rose Byrne, who plays the mother). Even the ""haunting"" relies upon an interesting concept related to astral projection. So, why 3 stars?  Well, that's because the last 1/3 of the film is absolutely dreadful. In fact, it is so bad that it feels as though a low-grade director co-opted from the SyFy channel took over directing for Guillermo DelToro in the last act. I honestly felt I was watching a really bad horror film from the 80s complete with lame special effects, haunted house-like phantasms and a demon being that looked like it came out of Labyrinth. I was expecting Freddy Krueger to pop in and make a cameo as Patrick Wilson's character wanders through fog-drenched dark rooms. In fact, the entire last sequence feels alot like what happened in Poltergeist when Jo Beth Williams' character goes into the ""otherside"" to rescue her daugher...except Tobe Hooper (who directed Poltergeist) had the wisdom to let the audience imagine what that place looked like. In INSIDIOUS, we are taken right into the ghostly dimension -- and it looks like a low grade neighborhood haunted house.  I think the reason I was so frustrated by this movie is because the first and second acts were brilliant and genuinely scary (I would say more scary than almost anything on screen in the last decade). Naturally, then, the crappy last act felt even more disappointing juxtaposed against the fantastic first and second acts.  I would still recommend it for the scares that are generated during the first hour.",3,Frustrating because the first 2/3 of the movie is so good...,1310342400,"07 11, 2011",2011,2028,"['agree', 'most', 'critics', 'audiences', 'INSIDIOUS', 'had', 'genuinely', 'nerve-wracking', 'moments', 'tension', 'dread', 'are', 'very', 'nicely', 'wound', 'up', 'movie', 'supernatural', 'aspects', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'are', 'subtle', 'shadow', 'things', 'could', 'actually', 'imagine', 'happening', 'sequence', 'involving', 'house', 'alarm', 'going', 'off', 'night', 'perfectly', 'pitched', 'will', 'have', 'stressed', 'edge', 'are', 'several', 'legitimate', 'gotcha', 'moments', 'rattle', 'nerves', 'acting', 'top-notch', 'esp', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'who', 'mother', 'Even', 'haunting', 'relies', 'interesting', 'concept', 'related', 'astral', 'projection', 'So', 'why', '3', 'stars', 'Well', 'last', '1/3', 'film', 'absolutely', 'dreadful', 'fact', 'so', 'bad', 'low-grade', 'director', 'co-opted', 'SyFy', 'channel', 'took', 'over', 'directing', 'Guillermo', 'DelToro', 'last', 'act', 'honestly', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'really', 'bad', 'horror', 'film', '80s', 'complete', 'lame', 'special', 'effects', 'haunted', 'house-like', 'phantasms', 'demon', 'being', 'looked', 'came', 'Labyrinth', 'was', 'expecting', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'pop', 'make', 'cameo', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'character', 'wanders', 'fog-drenched', 'dark', 'rooms', 'fact', 'entire', 'last', 'sequence', 'feels', 'alot', 'what', 'happened', 'Poltergeist', 'when', 'Jo', 'Beth', 'Williams', 'character', 'otherside', 'rescue', 'daugher', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', 'who', 'directed', 'Poltergeist', 'had', 'wisdom', 'let', 'audience', 'imagine', 'what', 'place', 'looked', 'INSIDIOUS', 'are', 'taken', 'right', 'ghostly', 'dimension', 'low', 'grade', 'neighborhood', 'haunted', 'house', 'think', 'reason', 'was', 'so', 'frustrated', 'movie', 'first', 'second', 'acts', 'were', 'brilliant', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'would', 'say', 'more', 'scary', 'almost', 'anything', 'screen', 'last', 'decade', 'Naturally', 'then', 'crappy', 'last', 'act', 'felt', 'even', 'more', 'disappointing', 'juxtaposed', 'fantastic', 'first', 'second', 'acts', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'scares', 'are', 'generated', 'first', 'hour']",Insidious

Something with a ton of suspense...maybe not the most original plot and some really great actors. If only they'd decided to go ahead and make THAT movie...This was awful. Just awful. However, it started out really well. As per usual, we get the seemingly normal, attractive, happy family just going about their daily lives when...suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, bad things happen. Suspense starts to build when they begin hearing strange sounds, seeing strange things...it's all very creepy and simple at this point in the movie. Very effective.Then we enter the second half. When things REALLY started going downhill. The explanation for what was going on was interesting enough, not very original, maybe a bit silly but, interesting nonetheless. The first time I saw the ""demon"", I was shocked. Really shocked. Mostly because of how idiotic it looked. Then I started thinking wow, they actually put THAT in a movie. I brushed it off and said to myself that it had been great so far...maybe we won't see it again. But we do...time and time again. Along with other ridiculous looking creatures and people or...whatever you want to call them. The entire thing was just absurd.In the second half, I felt like I'd started watching a different movie. The entire tone changed, the pacing changed, the look and feel of the movie changed. It turned into completely cheesy trash. The sets were horrible, the costumes, the makeup, the effects were some of the worst I've ever seen. The guys who did Saw (only the first 2 Saw movies are watchable) and Dead Silence (terrible, terrible movie) have NO idea what ""creepy"" or ""scary"" looks like. Not to mention I feel like they keep copying themselves. The ""twist"" they always stick in there right at the end...ridiculous! It makes me mad at just how ridiculous...I just sat there shaking my head when I wasn't laughing. Someone obviously took a trip to a costume store and stocked up on as much discount makeup, bad masks and bad wigs as they could find. Cheap, cheap, cheap! It all just felt so lazy.Overall, what we have is something that could have been a really great movie but it was directed and designed by guys who have really bad taste and absolutely NO clue as to what ""scary"" is. A complete and total disappointment. I can't help but feel like James Wan is somewhere counting his money and laughing at everyone that wasted our time watching this mess.Avoid it.

I was mighty pleased and left the show still with chills up my back for about 5 minutes!  I would most definitely watch it again, even though I know what happens.A family of 5 (Mom, Dad, 2 young boys, and a baby girl) moves into a new house (not newly built, just new to them).

Books placed on a shelf are found on the floor.  The baby girl seems to cry a lot (but then babies tend to do that).Things seem to escalate fairly quickly after Duncan falls in the somewhat spooky attic, seemingly ok but slipping into a coma during the night.  Fast-forward 3 months.  Duncan is still in a coma but is back home.  Mom is downstairs and begins to hear indiscernible voices on the baby monitor.The scary stuff continues to escalate when Mom realizes something is WRONG!--it just ain't normal!  Even moving to another house does not help!  (Uh oh--real bad sign.) She talks to her mother-in-law (Barbara Hershey), who has a friend Elise  and her paranormal investigators who just might be able to help.The story is about demons, unsettled ""bad"" spirits, possession, and astral travel.

But before you give me that bad rating, please read the rest of my review.I went into this movie with sky high expectations. I know it isn't fair, but I kept hearing from people that the movie was terrifying. People couldn't sleep after, people were getting sick to their stomach, and others were saying it was the best movie to come out in years.The movie started off pretty decently, some of the acting was a little off, but I was willing to overlook it for the ghost aspect. The movie quickly goes downhill sadly. One ghost dances around looking like a Leprechaun, and it was hilarious. The ""demon"" looks like Darth Maul on crack, and the other spirits just are not scary. On top of this it was very predictable when and where the ghosts would show up.

Insidious held my interest throughout even though I found myself scoffing.  I couldn't help but wonder if this movie had been done several times before.  The plot seemed to borrow the same formulas we saw in countless other thrillers like, ""What Lies Beneath"", ""Poltergeist"" and ""Paranormal Activity"".  A child goes into a coma, but we soon discover its not a coma and more that he's got the gifts of astral projection and just travelled away too far where evil lurks.  A family moves into a home only to move out into another home because the mother senses there is something evil in that house.  Only problem is that whatever the evil is has followed them to the new home.  I always wondered how easy it would be to simply pick and move again if one felt dread in a house you just bought.  Her husband who is a teacher and has never worked late a day in his life, but is suddenly working late every night and she notices.  So do we.  This serves no purpose except to get him out of the house long enough so she can experience the evil and he can come home and tell her she's crazy.  Then there is a ghostbuster medium (think back to Poltergeist).  She almost gives this couple the same speech as the Medium in Poltergeist did about the whereabouts of their child and who is with it and why.  Still, regardless of all the obvious cliche's I enjoyed watching this.  It was fun, creepy and the cast does a well enough job that it feels believable and almost too real.

This is the perfect blend of realism without overwhelming special effects that are empty in meaning and corny background music that tries to fake you out.  This is a really good story that builds on itself (meaning what you watch in the beginning and what characters do and say comes to make sense in the plot later in the movie) is played out before your eyes with only a few special effects until you are captured in the movie and then come the real special effects that literally take you into that other world and blow your mind away.  When I say other world I literally mean it takes you into another world and keeps you there as the characters travel and have to discover how to survive between the two.  Maybe this is what throws some viewers off when So many horror movies give you a killer or evil spirit that only is to be known as an enemy with no soul that just kills because something once bad happened to him or it.  This movie has actual character, human and evil to make you really scared of it.  I repeat This movie gives you a world of horror and takes you there with subtlety and later in the movie complete boldness.  This movie is great also on its different take of horror & original in many circumstances.

Gets almost unbearably tense at a nice pace with scary noises and a great plucky, screechy (real!) violin soundtrack.My younger friend is jaded, you know, so he didn't like the malevolent creeps - but I thought they were great. For this particular movie, I think it needs an audience, in the theater, with the sound turned up nice and high.The booms, fwomps, swooshes and other ambient noises help carry this movie into Horror-Land (except for the home alarm. Be ready to cover your ears. It's only briefly annoying, though).I thought the analogy to a roller coaster ride or a Haunted House ride was appropriate. It certainly has it's moments, I tell you.The second half got into Ghostbusters territory a little bit but the main characters - Dad, Mom, Grandother, two sons, and a baby girl that's a bit of a cryer - took their roles seriously, played them straight, and really pulled you into the story.When the ersatz Ghostbusters show up, there's a bit of corny explaining but soon it's back into Scares-ville.

1414637,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004LWZW24,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","As most readers by now realize I love horror movies. The problem is that over the past few years there have been so few that I've enjoyed. It seems like these days almost all horror films are remakes or sequels. If they are original they turn out to be more along the lines of horror porn than horror film. Then on occasion you find someone who loves horror movies as well and makes them for that audience. Director James Wan is one of those directors.Wan's career took off with the first SAW film. While many might think this was the first in the horror porn genre (so named because films in that category dwell more on gory realistic effects than anything else like a story) it actually had more story to it than many movies being released at the time. He then made DEAD SILENCE, a creepy film that featured a ventriloquist dummy in the most terrifying manner. And now Wan has turned lose INSIDIOUS.The film opens with a family moving into a new house. Mom Renai (Rose Byrne) writes music in her spare time while juggling taking care of three kids. Father Josh (Patrick Wilson) is a teacher. Both are trying to turn this new home into something special. Instead they find something terrifying.Shortly after moving in their oldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) is lured to the attic by a mysterious force and then falls from a ladder. The next morning Dalton is in a comatose state and the doctors are clueless as to why. Three months later there is no change in Dalton but there is in the house. Something evil lurks there, creeping along in the shadows and seen only by Renai. The visitations increase until she convinces Josh that they need to move, which they do.At their new house things seem brighter and more modern. But the visitations continue, increasing in strength and length. It is at this time that Josh' mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) suggests that a friend of hers come over. Elise (Lin Shaye) is a psychic of sorts who sends her crew in first to check the place out and see if it's legit or not. Sort of a bumbling duo that seems like a spoof of the numerous ghost hunting shows these days, the two find evidence and call Elise in.After a quick examination of the house, Elise confirms that they do indeed have a problem. But she also points out that it isn't the house or the previous house that are haunted. It's their son, Dalton. Now before someone accuses me of dropping a spoiler on them know that this was seen in the film's trailer.What happens next, the visions that are seen and the attempt to rescue Dalton make for a visually frightening film. Add to it a twist that most won't see coming (I didn't) and you have a story on hand that should offer a few nightmares to some and a reason to check the windows at night to others.Wan occasionally uses the old bag of tricks with jump scenes where something pops up out of nowhere. Once in a while the music suddenly blares to let the audience know to pop up out of their seats. But he doesn't rely solely on these tricks to make us scared. He leads us along with an actual story that draws us in, makes us care and eventually has us rooting for this family. Telling a story that scares us, using visuals and not just jump scenes takes an accomplished director and I see that in Wan.The acting turned in here is great. It wasn't until after I sat for a while when the movie was over that I realized we had so little background info on some of these characters. But it didn't matter. They were all played so well that they became believable and you worry more about them than whether or not the actor is doing a good job.Visually this movie is as clean as you can get. Starting with shots in an older home with an attic to a newer more suburban home, both offer some scary shots and scenes that will stick with you. Most horror films shot at night or in the dark tend to go overboard and you can't see what you're supposed to be looking at. Not so with this film, one that hides what needs hidden and yet lets you feel like you're there.As I said, I love horror films.

To begin with we have an excellent cast headed by Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, the parents of 2 young sons.  Josh (Wilson) is a teacher and Renai (Byrne) a struggling songwriter and full time homemaker.  They move into a new house which, as expected, is apparently haunted.  Here we get some very creepy scenes of haunting ghosts and demons. The twist is that they move again and viola, the ghosting is back!

1414654,A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,B004LWZW24,Monkdude,"[2, 5]","Insidious is a well crafted and acted haunted house film, but it didn't quite pack the scares that the reviews I had previously read led me to believe. Don't get me wrong, sitting in a dark theater with the sound jacked up provided a couple of tiny jolts in my case, while a woman in the back screamed out loud at least once. Most of the scares are of the cheap variety (though some were very well done), but they are implemented with really loud sounds and music crescendos, so it does the trick more often than not. Don't let the PG-13 rating fool you. In the right hands, in this case James Wan, it will have you bracing for impact whenever things get a little too quiet.The story is about a couple with three young children. They move into a new home and almost right away they know something isn't right. One of their sons goes into a coma of sorts and they learn that evil spirits are trying to break out through his unconscious body. I liked the ""Poltergeist"" approach of the son being haunted and not the house. No matter where they go, as long as the boy is with them, evil will be there as well. The first and second half of the film are so different, I think a lot of people will be split on which is better. I liked the slow building and rather typical haunted home vibe early, but I also thought the other dimension aspect and explanation used later was well done too, minus a couple of scenes that weren't pulled off to their full potential (like Darth Maul demon, hence the title of this review).If you haven't already, check out The Changeling with George C. Scott (or better yet, buy it here for less than $6.00). It's an often overlooked ghost story from 1980, but it proves the less is more approach is almost always more effective than the in your face technique. The s&eacute;ance scene alone is one of the most chilling I've ever seen. Insidious doesn't measure up to it, but I would still recommend watching it on a dark and stormy night, preferably with the lights off and your surround sound turned to 11.3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",3,This is what happens if you watch The Phantom Menace too many times...BEWARE (explanation below),1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,2054,"['Insidious', 'well', 'crafted', 'acted', 'haunted', 'house', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'pack', 'scares', 'reviews', 'had', 'previously', 'read', 'led', 'believe', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'sitting', 'dark', 'theater', 'sound', 'jacked', 'up', 'provided', 'couple', 'tiny', 'jolts', 'case', 'woman', 'back', 'screamed', 'out', 'loud', 'least', 'once', 'Most', 'scares', 'are', 'cheap', 'variety', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'implemented', 'really', 'loud', 'sounds', 'music', 'crescendos', 'trick', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'fool', 'right', 'hands', 'case', 'James', 'Wan', 'will', 'have', 'bracing', 'impact', 'whenever', 'things', 'get', 'little', 'too', 'quiet.The', 'story', 'couple', 'three', 'young', 'children', 'move', 'new', 'home', 'almost', 'right', 'away', 'know', 'something', ""n't"", 'right', 'One', 'sons', 'coma', 'sorts', 'learn', 'evil', 'spirits', 'are', 'trying', 'break', 'out', 'unconscious', 'body', 'liked', 'Poltergeist', 'approach', 'son', 'being', 'haunted', 'not', 'house', 'matter', 'where', 'go', 'as', 'long', 'boy', 'evil', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'split', 'better', 'liked', 'slow', 'building', 'rather', 'typical', 'haunted', 'home', 'vibe', 'early', 'also', 'thought', 'other', 'dimension', 'aspect', 'explanation', 'used', 'later', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'too', 'minus', 'couple', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'pulled', 'off', 'full', 'potential', 'Darth', 'Maul', 'demon', 'hence', 'title', 'review', '.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'check', 'out', 'Changeling', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'better', 'yet', 'buy', 'here', 'less', '6.00', 'often', 'overlooked', 'ghost', 'story', '1980', 'less', 'more', 'approach', 'almost', 'always', 'more', 'effective', 'face', 'technique', 's', 'eacute', 'ance', 'scene', 'alone', 'one', 'most', 'chilling', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Insidious', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'watching', 'dark', 'stormy', 'night', 'preferably', 'lights', 'surround', 'sound', 'turned', '11.3', '1/2', '5', 'stars']",Insidious

After the family moves in search of some peace, the events continue to occur.

When I saw it in theaters last year, I was blown away. It was EXCELLENT, and I don't say that lightly. A throwback to the great, supernatural horror films like Amityville, Poltergeist, The Exorcist, The Entity, Rosemary's Baby, and The Shining, ""Insidious"" is a truly fascinating and scary film! In fact, it instantly and easily became one of my favorite horror films from the first time I saw it. If you're looking for proof that recent horror films aren't all bad, I've got three masterpieces for you, and this is one of them. The other two are ""Cabin in the Woods"" and ""The Mist"", but I digress.A fine cast (including ""The Entity"" star Barbara Hershey) , some plot qualities we've never seen before, and some truly scary music and imagery make this film a cut above the rest, and I highly recommend it. Don't listen to nay-sayers who  describe the ending as too open or the film's demon as too Darth Maul-esque. There is nothing but win here. The demon is freaky and the Tip Toe Through the Tulips scene, ugh! Try getting that song and its creepiness out of your head after seeing this for the first time! I only hope the upcoming ""Sinister"" is this good!Now, the Blu-Ray bonus features are a bit underwhelming. There are 3 behind the scenes featurettes, that's pretty much it. They are good, but this film deserved so much more. However, if you love horror films, this movie belongs on your shelf, so I guess they get away with it this time.

The movie is about a coupel with two kids, one of the kids goes into a coma. The doctors don't know when he will come out so they take him home only to have creepy events happen in their house. They come to find its not the house that haunted. The film starts slow with a very tense feel to it and this tone stays with the whole film. The director (James Wan) really builds suspense. The soundtrack whilst does have an orchestra at times, uses mostly organic sounds to give the movie a heartbeat one example there is a grandfather clock that has a beat that builds more suspense than orchestras.The acting is strong and believable. The movie is one of a new trend of horror movies that has a very low budget, making the director use his imagination. Paranormal Activity started this popular trend and Insidious borrows form the feel of it. After 30 minutes of this, the movie switches from the Paranormal Activity routes to a more original feel that many may be lost on, but It gives the movie a fresh take and separates it from other house haunting movies. The movie is a rare PG-13 movie that people enjoyed. It has zero gore, but replaces it with many well built jump scares.

I'm 44 yrs old, I've found some of the younger generation have been de-sensitized when comes to at least horror movies. The movie has genuine scares relying on sounds, lighting, good costume and make-up, an overall atmosphere set nicely for a some good scares. Horror movies are not all about blood splatter, gore & CGI effects. Real horror movies that want to scare you will have a good atmosphere, good acting and a decent script, this movie has it all.For the reviewers that complain about the ending, it's an ending thats in-line with a ""Twilight Zone"" twist type ending. For most those that are in their 20's they probably won't understand that. Basically not every movie has to have a happy ending, or even one that will answer every single question for you throughout to the end of the movie.If a movie ends with an un-expected event that may leave you hanging....then the writers did their job...they caught you off gaurd and you'll have to use your imagination to finish the story.My 22 yr old step-daughter told me when I asked her if the movie was any good? She said ""your not missing nothing and a dumb ending"". I took that chance and watched it. I found that she did not grow up with shows like ""Outer Limits"" or ""Twilight Zone"" which often had a slight twist at the end. If you have no clue on how those shows generally ended up, then you may not get this movie at all.I will agree with some reviewers about the scene when the Father checks the front door the first time and it wasnt even locked to begin with, then he doesnt even lock it after closing it back, but only puts on the chain lock, that would be poor scene on part of the screenwriter, aside from that no issues with this one.

1414663,A13A1VWTPL9W7J,B004LWZW24,"Nick Carmine ""Nick Carmine""","[6, 7]","It takes a lot to scare me. I've got roughly three decades of horror movie watching and fandom accrued, and few movies from the horror genre genuinely impress me - especially nowadays, where crass film studios forego any semblance of quality in favor of cranking out endless lame sequels, and complicit audiences reinforce studio behavior by continuing to shell out box-office ducats for cinematic offal. Insidious is one of the few recent horror entries to actually provide genuine scares. There are several elements I can point to which explain why next.Firstly, this film focuses on the element of dread. So few horror movies today generate any real dread, and instead use cheap cat-jumping-suddenly-into-frame scares, overly elaborate death scenes, and/or look-how-psycho-I-am killers to mask the fact that they don't really offer anything truly scary. Examples of this in the horror genre are legion, such as any film directed by Rob Zombie (I mean seriously, is anyone really scared by dirty, profane trailer park rejects or long haired blonde kids wearing rock tees?). Even the people that made Insidious are guilty of some of this (read: the Saw films). But in the case of Insidious, the filmmakers put most of the cheap techniques aside and instead utilize excellent atmosphere, decent pacing, competent editing, and thoughtful scoring - all of which combine to really drop the psychological hammer on the viewer.Secondly, the family being tormented in the film is sympathetic. Though the characterizations of them aren't overly deep, the important thing is that the family isn't an object of audience irritation. This is such a basic rule in making an effective horror flick, and yet it is constantly ignored by the hacks that put out most ""horror"" films. Most times I want to punch horror film characters for being abjectly irritating or stupid; so it's only gleeful schadenfreude on my part, and not fear, when they meet their inevitable end. This film produces real apprehension simply by generating a basic level of empathy for the family.Finally, the film utilizes top notch camera work and shot framing. This is SUCH an important aspect in terms of inducing fear in the audience, but most horror films don't even bother (or their directors just simply don't have a decent feel for how the framing and position of their camera can completely add or subtract to the audience's level of psychological torment.) There are quite a few moments in Insidious where the director uses his knowledge of the audience's knowledge of overly used horror film camera techniques to mess with them and to manipulate their expectations - which of course works brilliantly to throw the viewer off kilter and generate real foreboding.To wrap up, quite a few of the negative reviews I've read here are plainly misguided. Some argue points that have weight, but to say that the film needed more special effects or that it didn't have any scares just underscores the fact that many horror movie audience members clearly don't appreciate horror flicks that aren't garish or that forego theme park bells and cheap (or not so cheap) thrills. Yes, I'll grant that the first half of the movie is superior to the second, and that the film goes off the proverbial rails a bit in the second half. I'll also concede that the paranormal investigators and a couple of the story elements are a tad over the top and annoying. But to say it can't be any good because it channels Poltergeist or other films is a completely baseless argument. Horror films and indeed most other films ARE derivative; it's just the inevitable result of an industry with a century-long history. The question isn't whether a film uses ideas, plot devices or tropes that other films have used (as, at this point, it's almost impossible not to), the question is, does the new film do it in an effective way while bringing some fresh elements to the mix? Since Insidious in the end is a pretty effective little haunted house variety nail-biter, and definitely one that will several times make your best girl squeeze you tight, in this case the answer is yes. I give it three and three quarters stars and say ""Check it out.""",4,A Tension-Laced Little Horror Entry that Offers Genuine Scares,1323907200,"12 15, 2011",2011,4176,"['lot', 'scare', ""'ve"", 'got', 'roughly', 'three', 'decades', 'horror', 'movie', 'watching', 'fandom', 'accrued', 'few', 'movies', 'horror', 'genre', 'genuinely', 'impress', 'especially', 'nowadays', 'where', 'crass', 'film', 'studios', 'forego', 'semblance', 'quality', 'favor', 'cranking', 'out', 'endless', 'lame', 'sequels', 'complicit', 'audiences', 'reinforce', 'studio', 'behavior', 'continuing', 'shell', 'out', 'box-office', 'ducats', 'cinematic', 'offal', 'Insidious', 'one', 'few', 'recent', 'horror', 'entries', 'actually', 'provide', 'genuine', 'scares', 'are', 'several', 'elements', 'can', 'point', 'explain', 'why', 'next.Firstly', 'film', 'element', 'dread', 'few', 'horror', 'movies', 'today', 'generate', 'real', 'dread', 'instead', 'use', 'cheap', 'cat-jumping-suddenly-into-frame', 'scares', 'overly', 'elaborate', 'death', 'scenes', 'and/or', 'look-how-psycho-I-am', 'killers', 'mask', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'offer', 'anything', 'truly', 'scary', 'Examples', 'horror', 'genre', 'are', 'legion', 'such', 'film', 'directed', 'Rob', 'Zombie', 'mean', 'seriously', 'anyone', 'really', 'scared', 'dirty', 'profane', 'trailer', 'park', 'rejects', 'long', 'haired', 'blonde', 'kids', 'wearing', 'rock', 'tees', 'Even', 'people', 'made', 'Insidious', 'are', 'guilty', 'read', 'Saw', 'films', 'case', 'Insidious', 'filmmakers', 'put', 'most', 'cheap', 'techniques', 'aside', 'instead', 'utilize', 'excellent', 'atmosphere', 'decent', 'pacing', 'competent', 'editing', 'thoughtful', 'scoring', 'combine', 'really', 'drop', 'psychological', 'hammer', 'viewer.Secondly', 'family', 'being', 'tormented', 'film', 'sympathetic', 'characterizations', 'are', ""n't"", 'overly', 'deep', 'important', 'thing', 'family', ""n't"", 'object', 'audience', 'irritation', 'such', 'basic', 'rule', 'making', 'effective', 'horror', 'flick', 'yet', 'constantly', 'ignored', 'hacks', 'put', 'out', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'Most', 'times', 'want', 'punch', 'horror', 'film', 'characters', 'being', 'abjectly', 'irritating', 'stupid', 'only', 'gleeful', 'schadenfreude', 'part', 'not', 'fear', 'when', 'meet', 'inevitable', 'end', 'film', 'real', 'apprehension', 'simply', 'generating', 'basic', 'level', 'empathy', 'family.Finally', 'film', 'utilizes', 'top', 'notch', 'camera', 'work', 'shot', 'framing', 'important', 'aspect', 'terms', 'inducing', 'fear', 'audience', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'directors', 'just', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'decent', 'feel', 'how', 'framing', 'position', 'camera', 'can', 'completely', 'add', 'subtract', 'audience', 'level', 'psychological', 'torment', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'moments', 'Insidious', 'where', 'director', 'knowledge', 'audience', 'knowledge', 'overly', 'used', 'horror', 'film', 'camera', 'techniques', 'mess', 'manipulate', 'expectations', 'course', 'works', 'brilliantly', 'throw', 'viewer', 'kilter', 'generate', 'real', 'foreboding.To', 'wrap', 'up', 'quite', 'few', 'negative', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'here', 'are', 'plainly', 'misguided', 'argue', 'points', 'have', 'weight', 'say', 'film', 'needed', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'scares', 'just', 'fact', 'many', 'horror', 'movie', 'audience', 'members', 'clearly', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'horror', 'flicks', 'are', ""n't"", 'garish', 'forego', 'theme', 'park', 'bells', 'cheap', 'not', 'so', 'cheap', 'thrills', 'Yes', ""'ll"", 'grant', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'superior', 'second', 'film', 'proverbial', 'bit', 'second', 'half', ""'ll"", 'also', 'concede', 'paranormal', 'investigators', 'couple', 'story', 'elements', 'are', 'tad', 'top', 'annoying', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'Poltergeist', 'other', 'films', 'completely', 'baseless', 'argument', 'Horror', 'films', 'indeed', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'ARE', 'derivative', 'just', 'inevitable', 'result', 'industry', 'century-long', 'history', 'question', ""n't"", 'film', 'ideas', 'plot', 'devices', 'tropes', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'used', 'point', 'almost', 'impossible', 'not', 'question', 'new', 'film', 'do', 'effective', 'way', 'bringing', 'fresh', 'elements', 'mix', 'Insidious', 'end', 'pretty', 'effective', 'little', 'haunted', 'house', 'variety', 'nail-biter', 'definitely', 'one', 'will', 'several', 'times', 'make', 'best', 'girl', 'squeeze', 'tight', 'case', 'answer', 'yes', 'give', 'three', 'three', 'quarters', 'stars', 'say', 'Check', 'out']",Insidious

The artwork reminded me of a Children of the Damned poster and had what appeared to be a possessed child standing in front of a house. The movie began and I learned about a young couple Patrick Wilson (Josh) and Rose Byrne (Renai) who had a young son  Ty Simpkons (Dalton) and a newborn baby.A few over imposing spirits have apparently haunted the house. Ghostly children play records and skip throughout the house laughing. A very large man paces back and forth anxiously about the porch. Demonic figures stalk the nighttime world. The couple's newborn baby cries for no apparent reason... A devilish voice can be heard screaming behind the baby's cry from a baby monitor. As the attacks and haunting grow stronger, Renai pleads and then eventually begs for her husband Josh to move her and the family out and away from the cursed home. The family moves and quickly discovers that this house is apparently haunted as well and the little boy slips into a deep coma. Renai calls a team of Paranormal Research Experts to investigate the haunted happenings.Two men enter the home and the ghost hunting does begin. As the two men are apparently humoring the victims by ""Ghost Busting"" the house with the equivalent of a ""Fuzz Buster"" the team soon realize that a more experienced teammate must be called. Elise, the teams channel-er, psychic and clairvoyant notes that there appears to be an insidious force who want to crawl inside the body of their young son. The father rejects the possibility of the fact that his house is not the thing that's haunted; it is his son. Further research of the boy's room and artwork drawn by the boy would then conglomerate this possibility very strongly and thus the team of paranormal experts along with the boy's parents will have to descend into a world of darkness from the dream world where the little boy has been trapped due to his uncanny ability to ""Astrally Travel"".Insidious is a movie that reminds me of several movies all in one: Poltergeist, Paranormal Activity, Wes Cravens New Nightmare and a slew of others. Insidious also has a few elements that remind me of the video game Fatal Frame. I was pleasantly surprised to find out just how spooky and chilling the movie actually was and found myself not only glued to my seat but also jumping from fright along the way. Quick ghastly images and disturbing concepts makes this movie my top-horror pick so far for 2011. I highly recommend this movie for any horror fan or for anyone wanting a good old-fashioned scare.  No real gore or excessive killing here and that is what makes this a movie that will probably have you saying, ""They Just don't make movies like this anymore"". Insidious is not fun for the whole family and is rated PG-13 for a very good reason. Insidious is definitely the stuff that nightmares are made of.The Cast:Patrick Wilson - Josh Lambert Rose Byrne - Renai Lambert Lin Shaye - Elise Rainier Ty Simpkins - Dalton Lambert Angus Sampson - Tucker Barbara Hershey - Lorraine Lambert Andrew Astor - Foster Lambert Corbett Tuck - Nurse Adele Heather Tocquigny - Nurse Kelly Ruben Pla - Dr. Sercarz John Henry Binder - Father Martin Joseph Bishara - Lipstick-Face Demon Philip Friedman - Old Woman J.

I enjoy everything from ""The Birds"" to ""LeatherFace"" to ""Twilight Zone"". Here's why I gave it 3 stars:#1: For me, the art cover of this movie is misleading. Because, well without giving the whole story away, the boy on the cover is actually not that much in the movie. -2#2: The first half of the movie reminded me of Paranormal Activity (which I dislike and was a HUGE disappointment). The second half is where the actual action starts. But the only scares are the cheap loud music tempos and the pop-up shots of scary characters. You know the ones that pop up real quick in front of the camera to try and scare you like the ones in a haunted house. +1#3: I would say that this was an okay rental but definitely NOT a purchase. I was very interested after I saw the previews and rent some of the reviews here. It made it seem like it was a mix of the Poltergeist and Exorcist. But unfortunately, I would rather consider it a mix between Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity. +1#4: I think if the director/writers really applied themselves to this movie, it could've been an awesome mental thriller - one that everyone would remember and would have been part of their Halloween routine. -2#5: I would just like to also add that this movie should not be viewed by children. Simply because they do not understand how astral projections work and may try to experiment with it not only causing damage to their selves but to others. If you do decide to allow your children to watch them, please explain to NOT COPY what they are seeing.

Also, I echo about what Mathematically Handicapped says about ""Darth Mal"" look alike doing a cameo in the movie.  If they would have spent more time on the latter half of the plot and taking out the ""Darth Mal"" look alike, the movie would have been more impressive.Usually a haunted House or a ghost story movie ends when the family moves out of the house.  But this movie did not end even when the family moves out and into another home which is brighter and  quaint.  This kind of made it interesting enough to watch the remainder of this film.  Also, the ghost/demons did not always appear in lonely, dark and dismal settings, but also in the plain light of day in the suburbs -and still retaining the chilling effect. Not to many movies like that out there that has that, except for paranormal activity(1 and 2).  I hope they do not milk this and come out with a sequel.  Keep it as is.  Oh, th  violin sound effects were classy in the beginning.It does have the creepy factor for those who live alone or at least isolated with an active imagination or even with a semi-active one.

Three months later Dalton (still in a state of unconsciousness) has returned as a Sick-in-bed kid who doesn't respond to anything or anyone. Soon after Dalton's return the family starts to have strange disturbances throughout the house that soon turn into a nightmare forcing them to leave the house. Apparently, the disturbances have followed them into there new house and they soon seek help from three professionals named Tucker, Specs, and Elise Rainier who soon find out that it's not the house that's haunted but rather the unconscious Dalton.  It is disturbingly learned that a demon is trying to posses his body while his sole is trapped in another plane of existence.  His father Josh Lambert learns he is the only one who can save him for he has had the same exact thing happen to him as well.Review: This film is amazingly creepy and even though it stole from other films stories like poltergeist and the exorcist it still was put together quite nicely. Not many films that I've seen have shown what a demons layer looks like nor have I had so many ghosts and evil beings scare me as much as this movie was able to provoke. This movie is superb, thrilling, and frightening and with a 1.5 million dollar budget it still managed to scare me and probably a lot of other people more than films such as Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho or Steven Spielberg's Jaws.Acting: Some of the acting did seem a bit overdone but the rest was intense and real. The best acting however goes to the demons/ghosts themselves... they sure know how to put on a inappropriate, sinister, and vulgar show while still maintaining a PG-13 Rating!Gore: nothing worth mentioning.... But this film did not need gore what so ever!The Bottom Line: A creepy little film that I believe is going to have a large cult... probably not as big as the Blair Witch Project's or Trick r' Treat's but it will always rank up there as one of the creepiest and most devious movie's I've ever seen!Warning: this film is Rated: ""PG-13"" for thematic material, violence, terror and frightening images, and brief strong languageIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: I give it a 7For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: I give it a 4",4,This movie does borrow alot but it also gives alot as well,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,2460,"['films', 'title', 'A', 'deceitful', 'enemy', 'Intend', 'entrap', 'very', 'well', 'whole', 'film', 'Plot', 'film', 'happy', 'family', 'just', 'moved', 'new', 'home', 'immediately', 'son', 'Dalton', 'ladder', 'presumed', 'be', 'coma', 'Three', 'months', 'later', 'Dalton', 'still', 'state', 'unconsciousness', 'returned', 'Sick-in-bed', 'kid', 'who', ""n't"", 'respond', 'anything', 'anyone', 'Soon', 'Dalton', 'return', 'family', 'have', 'strange', 'disturbances', 'house', 'soon', 'turn', 'nightmare', 'forcing', 'leave', 'house', 'Apparently', 'disturbances', 'have', 'followed', 'new', 'house', 'soon', 'seek', 'help', 'three', 'professionals', 'named', 'Tucker', 'Specs', 'Elise', 'Rainier', 'who', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'house', 'haunted', 'rather', 'unconscious', 'Dalton', 'disturbingly', 'learned', 'demon', 'trying', 'posses', 'body', 'sole', 'trapped', 'plane', 'existence', 'father', 'Josh', 'Lambert', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'save', 'had', 'same', 'exact', 'thing', 'happen', 'well.Review', 'film', 'amazingly', 'creepy', 'even', 'stole', 'other', 'films', 'stories', 'poltergeist', 'exorcist', 'still', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'quite', 'nicely', 'Not', 'many', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'shown', 'what', 'demons', 'layer', 'have', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'ghosts', 'evil', 'beings', 'scare', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'provoke', 'movie', 'superb', 'thrilling', 'frightening', '1.5', 'million', 'dollar', 'budget', 'still', 'managed', 'scare', 'probably', 'lot', 'other', 'people', 'more', 'films', 'such', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Psycho', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Jaws.Acting', 'acting', 'did', 'seem', 'bit', 'overdone', 'rest', 'was', 'intense', 'real', 'best', 'acting', 'however', 'demons/ghosts', 'sure', 'know', 'how', 'put', 'inappropriate', 'sinister', 'vulgar', 'show', 'still', 'maintaining', 'PG-13', 'Rating', 'Gore', 'nothing', 'mentioning', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'gore', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'creepy', 'little', 'film', 'believe', 'going', 'have', 'large', 'cult', 'probably', 'not', 'as', 'big', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Trick', 'r', 'Treat', 'will', 'always', 'rank', 'up', 'there', 'one', 'creepiest', 'most', 'devious', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Warning', 'film', 'Rated', 'PG-13', 'thematic', 'material', 'violence', 'terror', 'frightening', 'images', 'brief', 'strong', 'languageIs', 'Buy', 'scale', '1-10', 'give', '7For', 'Movie', 'scale', '1-5', 'give', '4']",Insidious

Where did they find this woman and why did the real actors agree to work with her?  I kept hoping she would channel somebody who had taken a couple of acting lessons.  Even when she &lt;spoiler> wound up as a corpse she was unbelievable. &lt;/spoiler>  Unbelievable but funny.  Just loll your tongue out next time - except there won't be a next time unless your (I'm assuming) producer son-in-law gets to roll another stinkburger - might I suggest ""Insidious 2: More Sidious"" to be followed by ""Insidious 3: The Final Sidious"".I think they could have improved the movie if they'd actually had people in sheets going ""Boo!"".

Either that or realize the calendar no longer reads 1988.But no, the director told the producer, ""Darn it - I've seen Poltergeist 100 times and I want everybody to know that.""  But to mix it up, we'll have an actual  &lt;spoiler> demon that looks like a 7-11 clerk who came across some black and red grease paint in the attic and decided he would really give the kiddies a treat this Halloween.  Look at me, I have plastic vampire teeth and cheesy contacts and I know how to use them.  So laughable.  The fact that they gave him cloven feet was when I knew it was a comedy.  Cloven feet!  LOLs galore!  You know your makeup man has mega-fail on his face when the kid's drawing is scarier than your actual demon.  At least slap some vaseline on the lens to keep us from seeing the shine from the grease paint.  The high point was when we get to go into his lair and see him sewing like Jamie Gumm.  No real reason - all evil demons sew I guess...or something.  But it sure made me think of that genuinely creepy character from 20 years ago.  If you're going to do that, just go ahead and unleash the death head moths.  Do it!  I dare you!OMG that medium was a bad actress.  Community theater bad.

Okay, that never happened, probably because they couldn't come up with a way to work it in.  But thank god they could rip off the Poltergeist ghostbusting crew.  I was sure one of those guys was going to get it (or rip his own face off) because they were such cardboard cutout never-known-the-touch-of-a-woman geeks that killing them could be the only excuse for bringing them into the film in the first place.  Either that or the make-your-own-movie Madlib cliche generator just barfed them up by chance, along with the fact that they were dressed like LDS missionaries.  I kept wondering where their bikes were and if the dry Utah air gave them constant nosebleeds.But oh no the ghosts are actually in the house, for reasons we don't know, and have taken physical form, such as they can appear everywhere and be illuminated by light, but instead of appearing in the actual place they want to be, or coming in through the door (since they are somehow physical ghosts) they'll appear behind creepy cabinet doors specifically so mean-geek can illuminate them and be freaked out only to run away to repeat the process for no known reason.

Without going into spoiler territory, the antagonist in Insidious is not just a noisy ghost, though it does make its share of noise. While in Poltergeist the child was snatched away through the TV, body and all, the child in Insidious is instead taken in mind only. This adds a layer of horror as the parents of the lost child must watch over his body, fearing that something is coming for it.Rise Byrne is especially effective in this movie.

When I saw the trailer, I was so excited, and anticipated opening day.This film will grab you right from the opening shots and its opening titles. James Wan knows how to set the mood for an experience that will fill you with fear and dread, and Insidious is proof. The cinematography is excellent and atmospheric... boasting a mostly muted and gray look, Wan's visual style sure is eye-catching and creepy.The film's plot revolves around a family of five- A married couple, Josh and Renai, a teacher and musician and their children. Having just moved into a new home, they seem to have a perfect sense of belonging. However, one night, the eldest child, Dalton, bumps his head after falling off the ladder and is soon in a comatose state.Three months later, creepy stuff begins to happen. Ghosts can be seen. Break-ins occur. They move to Josh's mother's place, but even that doesn't help. Soon, they find out it's Dalton that's haunted- not the house, as he is stuck in a realm called The Further!!!Insidious is creepy and good fun. If you're expecting jump scares every 5 minutes, you will be disappointed. This movie is largely tension based, and jump scares are minimal. Wan brings back what horror is about- being SCARED. To feel fear... to dread what's coming next.The performances are great too- Wilson is excellent, and so is Rose Byrne. Also turning in a good performance is Leigh Whannell-undoubtedly the show stealer- as the geeky and hilarious Specs. He and his buddy Tucker provide the comic relief (the flashlight scene was hilarious!!!).In short, Insidious is a success. Wan and Whannell clearly love being scared as much as we do, and it shows. To James Wan: Touche. Thanks so much for showing what horror is about!!!",5,A return to old school horror,1301616000,"04 1, 2011",2011,2209,"['nsidious', 'wow', 'what', 'can', 'say.It', 'starts', 'title', 'what', 'mean', 'head', 'Insidious', 'insidious', 'fascinating', 'word', 'Proceeding', 'gradual', 'subtle', 'way', 'harmful', 'effects', 'One', 'should', 'wonder', 'why', 'called', 'Insidious', 'was', 'excited', 'film', 'moment', 'James', 'Wan', 'announced', 'am', 'fan', 'Leigh', 'Whannell', 'have', 'been', 'Saw', 'Dead', 'Silence', 'was', 'scary', 'hell', 'Death', 'Sentence', 'was', 'pure', 'fun', 'When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'anticipated', 'opening', 'day.This', 'film', 'will', 'grab', 'right', 'opening', 'shots', 'opening', 'titles', 'James', 'Wan', 'how', 'set', 'mood', 'experience', 'will', 'fill', 'fear', 'dread', 'Insidious', 'proof', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'atmospheric', 'boasting', 'mostly', 'muted', 'gray', 'look', 'Wan', 'visual', 'style', 'sure', 'eye-catching', 'creepy.The', 'film', 'plot', 'family', 'five-', 'A', 'married', 'couple', 'Josh', 'Renai', 'teacher', 'musician', 'children', 'Having', 'just', 'moved', 'new', 'home', 'seem', 'have', 'perfect', 'sense', 'belonging', 'However', 'one', 'night', 'eldest', 'child', 'Dalton', 'bumps', 'head', 'falling', 'off', 'ladder', 'soon', 'comatose', 'state.Three', 'months', 'later', 'creepy', 'stuff', 'happen', 'Ghosts', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Break-ins', 'occur', 'move', 'Josh', 'mother', 'place', 'even', ""n't"", 'help', 'Soon', 'find', 'Dalton', 'haunted-', 'not', 'house', 'stuck', 'realm', 'called', 'Further', 'Insidious', 'creepy', 'good', 'fun', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'jump', 'scares', '5', 'minutes', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'largely', 'tension', 'based', 'jump', 'scares', 'are', 'minimal', 'Wan', 'back', 'what', 'horror', 'about-', 'being', 'SCARED', 'feel', 'fear', 'dread', 'what', 'coming', 'next.The', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'too-', 'Wilson', 'excellent', 'so', 'Rose', 'Byrne', 'Also', 'turning', 'good', 'performance', 'Leigh', 'Whannell-undoubtedly', 'show', 'stealer-', 'geeky', 'hilarious', 'Specs', 'buddy', 'Tucker', 'comic', 'relief', 'flashlight', 'scene', 'was', 'hilarious', '.In', 'short', 'Insidious', 'success', 'Wan', 'Whannell', 'clearly', 'love', 'being', 'scared', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'James', 'Wan', 'Touche', 'Thanks', 'so', 'much', 'showing', 'what', 'horror']",Insidious

1414690,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B004LWZW24,RMurray847,"[3, 5]","A few folks have remarked on how unusual it is that the creators of SAW created a more old-fashioned spookfest with INSIDIOUS.  I guess they've forgotten (for good reason) the promising but ultimately very disappointing DEAD SILENCE, also from SAW writing/directing team Leigh Whannell & James Wan.  They clearly have an affinity for scares over gore.  (Much of SAW, the scenes with Cary Elwes in the ""dungeon"" were more psychological horror than gross-out...and are still the most effective moments of the entire series.)INSIDIOUS is FAR superior to DEAD SILENCE, and frankly, it's far superior to many horror movies of recent years.  Whannell & Wan have been joined by Oren Peli (a producer), the guy behind the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY movies.  I don't know how much of a role Peli played in this film, but there are certainly moments in common.As with the PA movies, INSIDIOUS uses lots of moments were something suddenly appears or jumps out at you.  We can feel something is coming...the camera, music, silence, etc. built the tension and then POW, it happens, and you give a little jump in your seat.  Many movies try for that.  But Peli and company somehow have the timing down better.  I'm not sure how they do it...but when they go for a jump from their audience, they usually get it.  This is a satisfying experience, and is the reason we tolerate bad acting, silly plots and crowded theaters.  We want the communal experience of getting scared.INSIDIOUS tells the story of a family that moves into a new house and have weird things start to happen.  Worst of all, one of their sons falls into something like a coma and while nothing is medically wrong with the boy, he is no longer responsive to the world around him.  As weird things continue to happen, mom (Rose Byrne) begs dad (Patrick Wilson) to ""get out of this house.""  Normally, when this scene happens in a horror film (and it's an old clich&eacute; indeed), dad gets indignant and says ""no way"" and then things really go to hell.  Well here, dad says, ""okay, we're outta here.""  And they move.  Turns out, though, that whatever was bugging them in house #1 has tagged right along to house #2.  Not good.They turn to ""professional help"" and I think I can be forgiven for expecting the help to arrive in the form of a short, eccentric southern lady, as in POLTERGEIST.  INSIDIOUS reminded me of that film in many ways...a solid family, a modern house (not some old mansion that ANYONE would expect to be haunted) and kids in peril and parents willing to do anything to help.In the final third or so, the plot turns a bit silly and frankly, the scares pretty much dry up.  The ending is disappointing (as it so often is in horror films)...but overall, the film has built up enough goodwill to carry us through to the end.  The film has little gore, and is a nice, solid PG-13.  A scare us adults can enjoy with our older kids.  It plays itself deadly serious from beginning to end, and doesn't pander to the audience.  Yes, it is occasionally sillier than it needs to be...but it's constructed solidly, and is entertaining.Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson are okay actors and they are okay here.  Wilson, in particular, always strikes me as a bit bland (opposite Ellen Page in HARD CANDY and Kate Winslet in LITTLE CHILDREN, he practically disappears)...but he has a stolid earnestness that works for him here.  Byrne always has dark circles under her eyes and looks underfed, and this helps her (at  least physically) look the part of a worried-to-death mom.  Whannell, Wan & Peli are working with a small budget here...so presumably they couldn't get better actors.  I'll forgive them all that, because they also seem to be single-handedly keeping alive the good, honestly-earned scare.",4,"3.5 stars rounded up to 4.

1414692,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B004LWZW24,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 7]","Insidious (James Wan, 2011)The last time director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell got together, we got the criminally-underrated 2007 fright flick Dead Silence. It's a fantastic little movie, scary in all the right places, and pretty much no one saw it. The reason for that is the film they collaborated on before that--Saw. Well, okay, not Saw itself, but the series of increasingly-unwatchable sequels that came after it. Wan had nothing to do with them save throwing money at whoever was working on them at the time (Whannell wrote the next couple before dropping out, at which point he adopted Wan's ""we'll make money off it"" stance and became another executive producer). Wan and Whannell's names will forever be linked with the Saw franchise, despite neither one of them having had a firsthand effect on a Saw movie since Saw III, when Melton and Dunstan (The Collector) took over Whannell's writing duties, and the series abandoned any pretense of being other than the gory soap opera it is. Given all that, it's sometimes hard to remember that the traps and the gore in the original film were nothing more than accents concealing a perfectly-scripted, perfectly-paced mystery. For all that Saw took the roughie genre and dragged it into the mainstream, essentially inventing ""torture porn"", go back and rewatch the first movie--it isn't torture porn at all. Then came Dead Silence, which about half the time I'm convinced no one but me has ever seen. (Rectify that at your earliest convenience.) And so we come to Insidious, the third collaboration between the two. It is much more Dead Silence than it is Saw, and because of that, I'm quite surprised at the enthusiastic reception it got on the festival circuit. The reaction from the critics has been more predictable; many hated it. (As I write this, its Rotten Tomatoes rating is 60%; it's teetering on the ""fresh"" threshold.) I think it's possible a number of them missed something, and it's something very important to one's enjoyment of the film, in my regard: James Wan has jumped on the retro-horror bandwagon that came into being as (I have often suspected) a reaction to Hollywood's current, relentless remaking of old horror films under Michael Bay and Roy Lee's aegides. The thinking seems to be, ""if people are going to go see old horror films, why don't we make new horror films that seem like old horror films?"". The trend brought us two of the best films of 2009 in any genre, not just horror: Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell and Ti West's The House of the Devil. Insidious runs straight through those same veins, and of all the critics I've read on this issue, only AP's Christy Lemire has gotten it half-right, and she's the best anyone's done so far. More on that in a few.Plot: the Lambert family have just moved into a new house. We have dad, Josh (Hard Candy's Patrick Wilson), a schoolteacher; mom, Renai (28 Weeks Later...'s Rose Byrne), who's taking time off from corporate life (we never do find out what she does there) in order to focus on a nascent musical career we are to infer she gave up to get married and have kids; two sons, Foster (The Hangover's Andrew Astor) and Dalton (Little Children's Ty Simpkins, and I'm amazed this kid hasn't found superstar status yet), and the new baby. The first night, while everyone's just kind of hanging around, Dalton wanders up into the attic, which we already know is creepy because Renai was up there previous. He slips and falls, banging his head. Seems okay, but the next morning, he doesn't wake up. Hospital stay, etc., no one can figure out what's wrong with him. Until, that is, Josh's mom Lorraine (the always-welcome Barbara Hershey, recently of Black Swan) hooks Josh up with Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye, known primarily as a comedic actress, but her horror pedigree is a mile long and stretches right back to the original A Nightmare on Elm Street). It is Elise who delivers the movie's tagline, which I think was supposed to be a spoiler, but ended up in every trailer ever released for the film: ""it's not the house that's haunted. It's your son.""Lemire mentioned in her review (and in dialogue on Ebert Presents At the Movies with mubi.com's Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, who loathed it) that it's ""basically a remake of Poltergeist"". As I said before, she's half-right. It's very much informed by Poltergeist, with Shaye taking Zelda Rubinstein's role, but that wasn't Whannell's only source material here. The movie is equally informed by Sidney J. Furie's 1980 frightfest The Entity, and if you want to get where Wan and Whannell, especially the latter, are at with this movie, that's the critical component. The Entity was one of the best, and arguably one of the scariest, horror films of the eighties, and it basically got ignored because it was doing supernatural horror during the golden age of the slasher film. (Also, telling: who starred in The Entity? If you said ""Barbara Hershey"", you get the gold star. Including her in &lt;em>Insidious&lt;/em> was, I strongly suspect, not a random casting decision.) The Entity has not been nearly as influential as it should have been because of that, and so it's not as easily detected as Poltergeist as an influence. But watch The Entity and then watch Insidious and tell me you can't see where some of those shots came from. The best retro horror is retro horror that captures the feel of the seventies and early eighties while being rooted in the present day; The House of the Devil was a pure-D throwback to seventies satanic panic pictures with the cynical cultural awareness/self-obliviousness of the modern teenager subbing in the lead role. Insidious went the same way, except it's the modern family instead of the modern teenager.One of the other things we forgot as the Saw franchise degenerated was how subtle a screenwriter Leigh Whannell can be. That's something that didn't really resurface in Dead Silence, and thus I'm ashamed to say I forgot it as well. But check out the way, for example, Patrick Wilson's character is set up. Wilson is at his best when, as in Hard Candy, he's playing a sleazeball. And that's exactly the setup we get. We're expecting a sleazeball. You know exactly where Whannell is going with the elisions and the outright lies. What makes it all the more intelligent is that Renai knows it, too, but is also smart enough, and has been married to Josh long enough, to see through it. That's multi-layered storytelling for you right there, and it's well-done indeed. Now here's the thing: that sort of subtlety is, for obvious reasons, more easily detected in the first half of the film, which is basically all setup. (Even Vishnevetsky said, however reluctantly, that the first half of the movie was better.) But it doesn't just go away when we get to all the supernatural-action stuff. Everyone and their mother has been blasting the ending of this movie, and now that I'm thinking about it, I'm wondering if the problem wasn't Whannell's subtlety, but audience expectations that that subtlety had gone away. Which makes no sense; think about the Big Reveal scene in Saw, where it all came together and we finally got Jigsaw's identity (it's still one of my favorite Big Reveal scenes ever), and it was blessedly obvious (thanks to the overbearing montage that immediately followed it) how subtle all that setup had been. Wan and Whannell got rid of the montage here, thankfully, though they couldn't resist one flashback scene that wasn't necessary. Are you telling me you didn't see it all in retrospect, or that you didn't think it worked? Because it was absolutely there. Whether it worked or not is personal preference, of course. I thought it worked very well. (I also wonder how much influence producer Oren Peli had over the ending, which is a little too close to the ending of Paranormal Activity 2 to be a coincidence.) More to the point, would you have preferred the other, more obvious, ending? 'cause to me that would have felt like a major cop-out. (Oh, one other retro touch--the frenzied eating of spaghetti. Where have we seen that before?)In short--I liked this movie. I think I probably liked it a lot better than you did, but I also think that if you watch it another time or two, knowing the ending, you may pick up on a lot more of the reasons I liked it as much as I did. Hey, it's worth a shot. As far as the movies I compared it to above, it's not in the same league as The Entity, but it's on the same level, quality-wise, as Dead Silence and Poltergeist. If you haven't seen it yet, be aware this isn't your basic fright flick; you'll want to pay slightly closer attention than you otherwise might. *** 1/2",4,"Not bad, not bad at all.",1307664000,"06 10,

It is a film aimed at adults--particularly parents. Everything in INSIDIOUS is allegorical, each idea representing the aging parent whose aging children eventually grow up and enter a world (The Further) of which the parents are not part, but that the parents have experienced but have forgotten. Moreover, in this world exist terrors that may consume the children, changing them into something recognizable only in body while the spirit transforms into something awful--killer, paedophile, even a lonesome elderly person (an elderly mother or father who would leech the life from their children whose youth and success they resent)who seeks to draw the life from those that she latches to. Each ghost in INSIDIOUS represents a specific worldly terror. I'll not spoil the film by drawing comparison for them all, but think carefully about the parricidal ghost. What is the wish of many adolescents? And what parent does not fear being ""killed"" and forgotten by one's children?

After starting with Season 1 late last year, I recently just finished watching the final episode of Season 5 of the TV seriesSupernatural. In that series Sam and Dean Winchester are experts at fighting ghosts, demons and an array of supernatural phenomenon. While watching Insidious last night I thought to myself that the only thing missing from the movie was the Winchesters bursting through the door to save the day.Like Supernatural, Insidious is well done and has its creepy and genuinely scary moments. I knew that Director James Wan (Saw) wouldn't let me down in that department. Look for Wan's ode to Saw with a little drawing of the Jigsaw puppet subtly placed in the middle of Insidious. But give me Supernatural any day versus what ended up being a little predictable and silly with Insidious. The family in Insidious seems to be clear that something unnatural is going on in their house early on in the film. But do you think that stops anyone from going up to the creepy attic to investigate a strange noise in the big spooky house? Of course not.I think that it was Eddie Murphy in one of his early comedy routines that mocked the family inThe Amityville Horrorfor staying in the house even though at one point in that movie a message from beyond cries ""GET OUT"". A smart family would indeed get out! Well it's kinda the same in Insidious, except the concept is that the person is haunted versus the house...just like in 2009'sParanormal Activity...so it makes it a little tough to simply get out I guess.There are some good scares in Insidious....Not just jump out the dark, disturbing image accompanied by a loud bang scares either. But it all seemed a little familiar to me. Perhaps if my skin wasn't so thick these days to ghost stories due to my addiction to Supernatural I'd have been affected a bit more by the movie.I'm pretty sure that you'll get some nice chills with Insidious.

Sadly, I could not agree more.It begins as one of the most effectively creepy haunted house movies I've ever seen. I was positively giddy about it. Then somewhere around the halfway mark, it very suddenly devolves into something that looks like it was made for television. The scenes in ""The Further"" look like they were filmed on location at Spooky World. The general tone, the acting, and the dialog all take an unexpected turn for the worse.There are a few great moments in the second half that still make it worth watching. I especially liked the bit about the father's childhood photographs.Ordinarily, I'd give a lower score for such a let down, but I give this movie 4 stars on the strength of its first half alone.

We knew we would probably add this to our horror movie collection so we recommend it since it is very re-watchable. The sounds were very well done and the scary characters were very unique. The DVD quality was perfectly fine for this type of movie, blu ray was not necessary. The price was good, Amazon definitely had the best price and the free shipping over $25 is just a great option to have. We really liked the special features as well. The directors and actors really explained a lot of how the movie was made and created. Very interesting to see how funny everyone is on set for such a scary movie.

1414710,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B004LWZW24,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[1, 1]","Now here's a hard one to review without giving too much away, because this is just full of twists and turns.  I originally walked into this one knowing next to nothing other than that it was a haunted house story done as a collaboration between the makers ofParanormal Activityand the makers ofSaw, which was more than enough to pique my interest, and I had consciously avoided seeing any previews other than the original teaser.  Having seen the full trailer a bit later on, I think they actually give a little too much away, despite its leaving lots still unhinted at, and despite the fact that apparantly some people first thought the trailer was actually too vague.  So I could just say I don't want to spoil it, it's awesome, it's scary, get it; but I assume people want more than that out of a write-up.So here goes: upon moving into a new house, a normal, likable family of two parents and two young sons begin to experience strange and sometimes frightening events in their new home.  Familiar territory, but still highly effective if done right, as it is here.  And as the accidents and apparitions begin to increase, they do something I've never seen a family do in a haunted house movie: they move out BEFORE things reach a critical mass.  The reasons used in other movies to justify the family's staying even when everything is starying to go to hell in a handbasket - they've sank every last cent into the new house, a simple reluctance to accept the supernatural, the borderline-'possessive' nature of the haunting gets into the minds of one or more of the family members and makes them strongly and irrationally attached to the house in a way they don't even recognize - these can and have all come off good when done well (and sometimes come off badly instead, true), but it was very refreshing to see that simple and obvious step taken to defuse their supernatural problem (even though not all members of the family are convinced it's supernatural at that point).So they leave.  Unfortunately, it turns out that doesn't make anything better - the hauntings and the incidens come right with them, and continue to intensify.  Leading up to the pronouncement seen in the trailer, ""It's not the house that's haunted, it's the....""  With one of the family's children in deep trouble for a while now, the family turns in desperation to a psychic and her assistants for advice, not at all prepared for what they're going to hear.I'm not going to get into too many more specifics, but it brings in more new and freakish elements as it goes along.  Some of the coolest and most shocking implications are buried in the subtext and in the viewers's own interpretations.  One particular possibility just floored me, and opened up the door to other potentials.  The visual imagery, the jarring use of innocent music against twisted macabre settings and happenings that makes the music and the smallest sounds seem so sinister, and the impressive use of eerily realistic special effects (even more impressive when you consider the movie's $1.5 million budget in an era when it seems to cost a mint to film a canned soup commercial) are all noteworthy.  So is the fact that the movie gets even better - and arguably scarier - on subsequent views, when you realize what's going on in all the seemingly mundane scenes, and the unique meanings of seemingly familiar incidents early in the show.This is a winner all the way, and an absolute must for all horror fans.

Even the opening title sequence was creepy. Everything was spot on. The acting was great, the mood was perfectly set, you even had the creepy-looking child actor. The music was subtle and really set the tone, the newly moved-into house was filled with paranormal potentional. And it was even moreso magnified when we find out it really has nothing to do with the house!Quick recap: A family moves into a huge, obviously creepy(but not overly so) house and then something strange happens to one of their sons, Dalton. He ends up falling and hitting his head but the next morning, he never wakes up. Doctors can't explain why he won't wake up from the coma and nothing seems to work. The family moves on, eventually caring for the son at home. That's when the actual weird stuff starts happening. The mom, played by Rose Byrne starts seeing things, hearing noises. Naturally she thinks the house is haunted though her husband, played by Patrick Wilson needs a bit of convincing. Things keep progressing to the point where she pleads to leave the house. He agrees and they move. Of course things don't die down because it has nothing at all to do with the house they are living in.This is where the movie slowly starts heading downhill. They of course bring a paranormal specialist in on things and she explains what is happening to them, and their son. She seems to know an awful lot about these things and before we know it, a s&eacute;ance in the kitchen comes along, things are revealed, more odd stuff happens and finally, we get to the thrilling, super scary climax. Well, actually it really isn't all that frightening. I suppose if you scare easily, then maybe I can see this film as being an issue. Again, that's the problem with the final act. The fear-factor is all but gone. The mystery surrounding the film had been solved and there's not much left but to throw in a million different type of ghosts and beings and gloomy smoke and makeup. The actual ending is pretty neat, but some people may see it coming.I truly wanted to love this film and hoped it wasn't going to become a clich&eacute; like just about every other horror movie out there today. But things were revealed way too early and all the excitement and intrigue was gone. That is one reason why The Others is still one of my favorite thrillers ever. Not one drop of blood in that entire movie, but utterly spooky from beginning to end. I guess its true that the best ghost stories are where you never even see the ghosts.

1414744,A1QF10TB8AYTA3,B004LWZW24,"Wilmar Luna ""Author of The Silver Ninja""","[0, 0]","My girlfriend and I rented this movie because we wanted to see something scary, and for the first half, it was well on its way to becoming a very creepy and frightening movie.Unfortunately, like most horror movies. Once you hit the second half of the movie, it all starts going downhill from there. The make up for the main ""ghost"" was absolutely terrible and didn't illicit any fear. In fact, it was so bad, that you couldn't help but roll your eyes as to how bad the creature design was. The scary ghost old woman had the best make up of the bunch and was the scariest of them all, but she only shows up in a few scenes.Essentially, this movie is not as scary as one might hope. Its best moment was when the ghost was walking outside the house on the second floor and then suddenly it appeared inside the house and attacked the woman. THAT was scary, but is unfortunately, the ONLY scary part of this movie.This movie really could have knocked it out of the park. The editing, the shots, the atmosphere, everything was extremely well executed and definitely copied some of the scariest movies of our time. But once the second half with the psychic rolls around, it all goes down hill from there and makes you wonder, just what the hell happened? It's almost as if a different director or writer took over and threw the movie into the garbage. The second half of the movie is an absolute waste, and ruins what could have been an incredible, scary movie.You might get some enjoyment out of this movie if you watch the first half, but feel free to turn it off once the second half shows up.",2,Scary potential wasted by the 2nd half of the movie.,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,1589,"['girlfriend', 'rented', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', 'something', 'scary', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'well', 'way', 'becoming', 'very', 'creepy', 'frightening', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'hit', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'going', 'downhill', 'there', 'make', 'up', 'main', 'ghost', 'was', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'did', ""n't"", 'illicit', 'fear', 'fact', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'roll', 'eyes', 'how', 'bad', 'creature', 'design', 'was', 'scary', 'ghost', 'old', 'woman', 'had', 'best', 'make', 'up', 'bunch', 'was', 'scariest', 'only', 'up', 'few', 'scenes.Essentially', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'scary', 'one', 'might', 'hope', 'best', 'moment', 'was', 'when', 'ghost', 'was', 'walking', 'house', 'second', 'floor', 'then', 'suddenly', 'appeared', 'house', 'attacked', 'woman', 'was', 'scary', 'unfortunately', 'ONLY', 'scary', 'part', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'knocked', 'park', 'editing', 'shots', 'atmosphere', 'everything', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'executed', 'definitely', 'copied', 'scariest', 'movies', 'time', 'once', 'second', 'half', 'psychic', 'rolls', 'down', 'hill', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'hell', 'happened', 'almost', 'different', 'director', 'writer', 'took', 'over', 'threw', 'movie', 'garbage', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'absolute', 'waste', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'incredible', 'scary', 'movie.You', 'might', 'get', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'watch', 'first', 'half', 'feel', 'free', 'turn', 'off', 'once', 'second', 'half', 'up']",Insidious
1414745,ATO8TS5FPTF7N,B004LWZW24,Yoguini,"[2, 6]","Yes, it has a few effective scary moments, but the movie doesn't hold up (at all) because it doesn't know what it wants to be: psycho-horror film, fantasy, comedy or paranormal film. The result is a silly, sorry mishmash of a movie that repeatedly contradicts itself and can't live up to what it leads its viewers to expect. One character claims, ""It's not the house, it's your son that is haunted."" And yet the plot goes back to the same house to depict ""the further""---a supposedly other, ""astral"" realm ""beyond space and time"" that just happens to be grounded in the wood and mortar confines of the main characters' previous home. ""Don't call attention to yourself,"" an astral traveller is cautioned before entering that realm, and yet he enters it, carrying nothing less than a glowing lantern, and calls out repeatedly to loudly question each of the sad mannequin/mimes that themselves are supposed to represent the body-less entities that have been visiting a ""comatose"" boy. The dramatic seriousness of the first half comes to a halt with the entry of the comic duo that are supposed to represent the techno ghost busters who explain their tests are ""to weed out the crazies."" But why would there be any need to determine if the problems in the house are just due to madness when we later learn there is a history to the events in the film? And when there are no less than three people who witnessed the supernatural events? And how can one of the geeks instantly illustrate what a psychic describes without being psychic himself? Questions abound leading to the real mystery posed by the film: Did ANYONE bother to read this horribly disconnected script before it went into production?! Two amateur filmmakers would probably have done a better job.A ghostly old woman, a demon that recalls the wizard of oz, an elfin creature that runs about the house and bursts from an armoire, ghostly young girls, suggestions of an all too human intruder are the grab bag of baddies that populate this confused film. I saw this film thinking I was going to see something else.
