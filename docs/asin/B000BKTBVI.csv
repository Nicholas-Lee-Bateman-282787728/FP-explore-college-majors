943990,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000BKTBVI,A Customer,"[7, 9]","About half way through director Lexi Alexander's violent and blood-socked Green Street Hooligans, I started wondering who actually pays for all the damage these hooligans cause and who picks up the tab on all the medical bills when these guys are often beaten into unconsciousness?Green Street Hooligans is gritty and brutal and has a real edgy street flavor that will probably be a bit much for some viewers, but the film does an excellent job of showing how the British fans of soccer are rabid to the point of violence, delivering up lesson quite spectacularly to Elijah Wood, playing an American who gets caught up in a London gang.Wood plays Matt Buckner, a timid journalism major who is banished from Harvard when the powers that be discover drugs in his dorm, planted by his roommate. Faced with no other options he travels to London to visit his married sister Shannon (Claire Forlani) who lives with her British husband, Steve (Marc Warren).Steve was once an ex-hooligan - although now he lives in a lavish London apartment and one wonders what he does to afford such a pad - but he's given up the rebel-rousing life to become a family man. His younger brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam) is the current head of the ""firm"" - or gang - of West Ham. Matt falls in with Pete and Pete takes Matt to his first soccer game, Matt experiences the distinctive comradeship of soccer and after the game, he gets into the first fight of his life with an opposing team.Matt's initial apprehension regarding violence turns into a veritable appetite for it. As the battles turn increasingly bloodier, Matt must choose between the two worlds he's known, whether to continue to live on the edge with Pete or go back to his sister in her nice, middle-class world.The strength of the film is in the enormous appeal of Wood and Hunnam. Wood is exceptional in this role - it's certainly a nice departure from Frodo - and he really manages to capture Matt's wide-eyed innocence combined with the thrill of discovering an unfamiliar brand of violence and unashamedly embracing it. And Hunnam - one of Britain's most promising actors is absolutely magnetic as Pete.Observably, the theme of Green Street Hooligans is the ultimate impact of violence, how it can have devastating collateral effects and how the penchant for it is endemic in all of us. Alexander challenges the notion that violence is controllable - so many of these young men live so precariously treating violence like a right of passage or a blood sport; it's almost like a lifestyle to them.The movie manages to deliver up a balance between morality - that nagging element of conscience - and the fact violence that can overwhelm those who get a taste for it. My only hesitation with this film is that it tends to romanticize these men as good, when they're not. The movie doesn't try to hide the appeal of hooliganism for its supporters but doesn't exactly preach either.When the fights occur, they're handled expeditiously; the violence here is not gratuitous or unwarranted. And Alexander certainly knows this subject; she has a firm handle on the story and seems to fully understand the overriding notion that we can't escape our evolution and our capacity for violence even if we wanted to.

943992,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B000BKTBVI,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 1]","""Green Street Hooligans"" is one of the Best Bad Movies Ever Made. It is to football hooligans whatGlitteris to the music industry. In ""Glitter"", Mariah Carey is the outsider who finds her voice despite trying circumstances. In ""Green"", Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) is wrongly framed for drug possession whilst attending Harvard. This movie is to represent the departure of Wood from the Shire's innocence to the rough, tough life of hooligans.After crossing the Pond, Wood meets the leader of the West Ham elite (Charlie Hunnam,Sons of Anarchy: Season One) West Ham is ironically, the favorite club of Michael Caine. One wonders what he'd make of this movie. The West Ham Elite spend a lot of time beating each other up, and running away... then singing and dancing hobbit-like atop tables. There are enough song and dance numbers one would expect to see Mariah Carey or Christina Aguilera. Halfway through the movie, there's an obligatory voice-over by Wood. He gives the Moral of the Story at the end ofThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King [Blu-ray] andThe Faculty, so I was not surprised. By then, I was halfway asleep. But I perked up when Elijah gets his bare chest tattooed. That's as excited as got throughout the whole movie (it also explains my bestowal of 3 stars instead of 2)""Green Street"" has some unexplained questions.

I love English football and am familiar with the hooligan issue which made me excited to see it. There are segments in the film that were just great, but, overall, it was too melodramatic for my tastes. Further, the film was a bit clich&eacute;d. Elijah Wood plays the classic fatherless son who seeks guidance and affirmation from a gang (which, of course, is precisely what often occurs). The subplot of the privileged politician's son setting him up was again over familiar as was another substrain wherein his sister's husband got married and--yet again!--managed to morph a bad man straight. That was a dubious proposition indeed. As far as the acting goes I thought Charles Hunnam was sensational, but could not buy Wood as (even) a semi-tough firm member.

So, without a fight, he accepts his fate, and with nowhere else to go, he finds his estranged sister in London. There, he is quickly integrated into her boyfriends brothers lifestyle: a subculture of thugs who align themselves with a particular soccer team and then go to matches, get really drunk and then start fights with the other teams aligned thugs.Despite everything I've said to detract you from the film, it is well done. The fights are realistic and the subculture's portrayal is shocking and interesting. Shocking, because you can't believe people are this stupid, and interesting because there's a lot of them. Unfortunately, as I was watching, I couldn't help but think that these people are jobless idiots who are nothing but determents to their society and I'm sorry, but it's really hard to root for their success.ROCKY had a reason for fighting. There was even a fairly decent purpose to the violence in GANGS OF NEW YORK... and THE WARRIORS for that matter.The GREEN STREET HOOLIGANS fought for nothing more than to be able to gloat and say that they were the toughest subcultured soccer team aligned gang.

944006,A144BX2IT6AQAL,B000BKTBVI,Desdimona,"[3, 4]","Something about this movie makes me angry.  It's like, not everyone should tell every story.  It makes the realities on which those stories ride seem more false, or easier, or more digestible.  And they aren't.  This movie is so Hollywood, or close enough to it, making ""a gritty"" movie.On a solely technical level this movie is well made.  Shots are good; actors are good etc, etc.  And it makes for fine (as in, do you like this?  Yea it's fine) viewing.  But it is forgettable because it doesn't have much of a soul.It portrays its world like it was cooked up by someone who thought the subject matter was interesting and exciting, then did some research and wrote the script.  On this level it's fine, but where is the part of the story that moves you, the part that rings true, that makes a movie good?  Even if you don't know anything about this world, you may very well pick up that something's missing.The street, as in street violence, whether in the US, UK or wherever, is not easy.  There are some moving and heartening stories to come out of all that mess, but to really tell them someone has to know what they're talking about.  On the pathetically short, maybe 3-4 minute ""Making of Hooligans"" docudrama the director says,  ""It's about love and friendship and honor"".  Oh Yea?  So stinking what.  Isn't everything?  Go make a movie about something you know about and then maybe the truth of that ""love, friendship and honor"" will shine through.  And the producer literally says, ""It is a world that I was stunned to even know existed.  This is something I had no knowledge of whatsoever"".  Enough said.Example: In one scene an elder hooligan goes in to a neighborhood restaurant to have a gangster like talk with another elder hooligan.  The first elder tells the entire place to shut up, that he is trying to have a conversation.  One couple continues to talk and laugh, and well you know the rest of this tired scene.  Excuse me.  What restaurant is this?  Does senior hooligan frequent this place often, doesn't he have an ""understanding"" with the owner?  Because the owner is nowhere in sight.  So the owner permits this, for thugs to run his business off?  He or she wouldn't be in business long with no customers.  And if this is senior hooligan's turf doesn't he respect it enough not to get it closed down because people are too freaking petrified to go in there and spend their money.  Talk about not protecting your turf.  BS.You may have random violence inside at any gangland situated establishment.  But violence that isn't random takes place outside a lot.  At least that's what I've seen, and I've lived in the ghetto.  It might be old west style, but it's closer to the truth.  Business owners don't want to get their place tow up and also too much inside violence is just plain bad for business.Elijah Wood's character Matt's story is the most believable, mainly because this character is an outsider to the so-called hooligan world of the script.Also another clich&eacute; in this movie- scary black people.  Always, a few scary blacks let you know this world is ""really scary and bad.""",3,"The Good Parts- OK, The bad parts-Grrr",1192233600,"10 13, 2007",2007,3118,"['Something', 'movie', 'angry', 'not', 'everyone', 'should', 'tell', 'story', 'realities', 'stories', 'ride', 'seem', 'more', 'false', 'easier', 'more', 'digestible', 'are', ""n't"", 'movie', 'so', 'Hollywood', 'close', 'enough', 'making', 'gritty', 'solely', 'technical', 'level', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'Shots', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'good', 'etc', 'etc', 'fine', 'do', 'fine', 'viewing', 'forgettable', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'soul.It', 'world', 'was', 'cooked', 'up', 'someone', 'who', 'thought', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'interesting', 'exciting', 'then', 'did', 'research', 'wrote', 'script', 'level', 'fine', 'where', 'part', 'story', 'part', 'true', 'movie', 'good', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'world', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'pick', 'up', 'something', 'missing.The', 'street', 'street', 'violence', 'US', 'UK', 'wherever', 'not', 'easy', 'are', 'moving', 'heartening', 'stories', 'come', 'mess', 'really', 'tell', 'someone', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'pathetically', 'short', 'maybe', '3-4', 'minute', 'Making', 'Hooligans', 'director', 'love', 'friendship', 'honor', 'Oh', 'Yea', 'So', 'stinking', 'what', ""n't"", 'everything', 'Go', 'make', 'movie', 'something', 'know', 'then', 'maybe', 'truth', 'love', 'friendship', 'honor', 'will', 'shine', 'producer', 'literally', 'world', 'was', 'stunned', 'even', 'know', 'existed', 'something', 'had', 'knowledge', 'whatsoever', 'Enough', 'said.Example', 'one', 'scene', 'elder', 'hooligan', 'neighborhood', 'restaurant', 'have', 'gangster', 'talk', 'elder', 'hooligan', 'first', 'elder', 'entire', 'place', 'shut', 'up', 'trying', 'have', 'conversation', 'One', 'couple', 'talk', 'laugh', 'well', 'know', 'rest', 'tired', 'scene', 'What', 'restaurant', 'senior', 'hooligan', 'frequent', 'place', 'often', ""n't"", 'have', 'understanding', 'owner', 'owner', 'nowhere', 'sight', 'owner', 'thugs', 'run', 'business', 'off', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'business', 'long', 'customers', 'senior', 'hooligan', 'turf', ""n't"", 'respect', 'enough', 'not', 'get', 'closed', 'down', 'people', 'are', 'too', 'freaking', 'petrified', 'go', 'there', 'spend', 'money', 'Talk', 'not', 'protecting', 'turf', 'BS.You', 'may', 'have', 'random', 'violence', 'inside', 'gangland', 'situated', 'establishment', 'violence', ""n't"", 'random', 'place', 'lot', 'least', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'ghetto', 'might', 'be', 'old', 'west', 'style', 'closer', 'truth', 'Business', 'owners', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'place', 'up', 'also', 'too', 'much', 'violence', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'business.Elijah', 'Wood', 'character', 'Matt', 'story', 'most', 'believable', 'mainly', 'character', 'outsider', 'so-called', 'hooligan', 'world', 'script.Also', 'clich', 'eacute', 'movie-', 'scary', 'black', 'people', 'Always', 'few', 'scary', 'blacks', 'let', 'know', 'world', 'really', 'scary', 'bad']",N/A
944007,AKUGGJWVJ8QMQ,B000BKTBVI,"Edward C. Patterson ""Edward C. Patterson""","[17, 20]","Touted in the United States as the Film Hollywood doesn't want you to see, Green Street Hooligans crept into six theaters on September 9th and posted a weekend gross of $48,000, that is about $7,000 per site, which Hollywood would not have believed, considering the top grosser of the previous week (on 3,000 screens), eked out a per site gross of $6,000. So, why is this new Elijah Wood film being released by its makers and promoted by Wood's fans. Maybe because the Hollywood machine has misunderstood the film, thinking it's a violent gang picture about the underground of a British sport starring a cute furry Hobbit. My, my-have they seen it? Have they bothered to attend a Film Festival where it garnered rave reviews and awards? Well, the cats out of the bag and this riveting, taut, well-performed film has made a mighty entrance, blasting to hell the finite obscurity of Hollywood moguls.Simply premised, a Harvard drop-out (expelled) visits his sister in London has a chance encounter with an in-law who takes him under his wing and introduces him to organized British hooliganism, the Firms-in this case the Green Street Elite, wrapped around the fanaticism of Football (that sport we call in the states Society Football; or SOCCER). But the film is not about Football or the violence attached to the Firms. It's deeply entrenched in primal man-the tribal man of the village. Margaret Mead would be quite at home (rest her soul) observing the rival firms standing and riling each other, much like Neanderthals at a Mammoth hunt. The script wanders a bit on a thin plot, but allows the message to be clear. When you share a central bond with villagers and stand your ground, you have invested your soul in the collective reputation of the tribe. Outsiders, who lack this, are mere wimps.Elijah Wood as the Yank, Matt Buckner is superb as he grows a pair of balls over the length of the film. If you don't mind seeing everyone's favorite Hobbit have the stuffing beaten out of him, and scrapping like the Dickens and enjoying the violence incrementally, you'll be okay. The acting job is sterling and filled with the steel that overtakes the character. His mentor, Pete, played by Charlie Hunnam, rushes like a river through the work, giving it buoyancy. Hunnam's cockney cleverness and leadership keeps the film alive and crisp, never a boring moment. In fact, the violence, which is not gratuitous, but organic to the work, draws you in to take a good look. This is the real stuff and we want to see Elijah Wood slam and get slammed, and Charlie Hunnam lead the tribe to victory. Of course, there are villains and naturally, a moral twist as the simple plot and theme gets aced by human failures, which drains all the nobility from the initial premise.Excellent performances are delivered by Leo Gregory who plays Bovver, the fly in the Firm's ointment; and Geoff Bell and Terrence Jay, the bad guys, each on opposite sides of the pond draw out our natural tendancy to hiss on cue. Claire Forlani as Matt's sister delivers a credible performance, trying to match Elijah Wood with Buckner family nuances. Lexi Alexander, in her first directorial credit, does a splendid job handling angle and shot, many of which are iconic and deliver memorable punches, much like Elijah's Wood facial essays, which dot this film more than his others.Rated R for language (not only the proverbial F word, but also a bushel of the more offending C word) and mild drug use, the only thing this film lacks is sex-and if it were included, that would have been gratuitous. With strong performances from all cast members and particularly from their flagship, Elijah Wood, this is one film that may not be for all young Hobbits, but (I predict) will linger in the halls of film favorites for years to come. The film that Hollywood doesn't want you to see should be seen as often as possible, if not for the brilliance of the work, for no other reason than a firm vote of confidence for all grass roots efforts in the world of the creative arts.

Frodo (same actor as Lord of the Rings) plays a rich American who kicked out of University for taking the fall for his room-mate over drugs found in his room goes off to live with his sister who just happens to be married to former top lad of the West Ham hooligan firm ICF (Called in this film ""Green Street Elite"")Frodo meets up with the younger brother of the retired hooligan who is now leader of the firm and goes on to join in battles against Manchester United, Birmingham and Millwall firms.The film just follows the same boring format, super firm that never gets beat, camaraderie amongst thugs, never attack 'ordinary fans' were all lads with good jobs who love a tear up at the weekend blah, blah,blah.....We are treated to such nonsense as the firm tossing beer glasses about, dancing on tables and generally tearing their own pub up after beating a rival firm (you ever been to a pub in the UK mate?  The landlord would be round with a baseball bat in hand if some clown started jumping all over his tables)Every stereotype churned out today for the modern football fan is present here and fans of the tv show ""The real football factories"" will love this one.  People who read ""Hoolifan"" books and seriously believe what goes on in them will also appreciate this film.

It is a story so packed with violence that the underlying subplots get lost until the film is reduced to the size of a television screen.  Lexi Alexander wrote (with Dougie Brimson and Joshua Shelov) and directed this tense story about the strange cults ('firms') of grown men who align with the various soccer/football teams in London, accompanying the games with intense fighting in the manner of 'hooliganism'.  The story is well told by introducing a Yank into this atmosphere, allowing the viewer to see the origins and machinations of hooliganism from a fairly unbiased stance.Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) has just been expelled form Harvard in his last semester, taking the blame for his coke-snorting hotshot roommate whose family is too important for such blunderings.  Somewhat without direction and not having his degree in journalism completed (Matt's father - Henry Goodman - is a high ranking international journalist whose time is spent in foreign ports since the death of Matt's mother) Matt flies to London to live with his sister Shannon (Claire Forlani) and her husband Steve (Marc Warren) and their young son.  Steve's rowdy brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam) interrupts Matt's arrival with a demand for money from his older brother and reluctantly accepts the company of the new Yank Matt in order to gain cash from Steve. What ensues is Matt's introduction to the GSE (Green Street Elite), a firm of men who defend the honor and success of their chosen soccer team: there are many such firms of street violence gangs who vie for ranking within the city.  Matt is plunged into this violent situation and learns form Pete the importance of gang stance: always protect your brothers and never flee a fight.  The story grows increasingly complex and intense as we learn the backgrounds for hate and intolerance, one of these hates is for journalists and when it is discovered that Matt was a journalism major at Harvard the news nearly causes Matt's life.  But Matt slowly identifies with the firm and grows into a sense of individuality that he has never had, giving him the ability to face the realities of his father's absence and to understand the precarious marriage of his sister whose husband is a 'reformed' hooligan.  In the end there is a 'justification' for the violence witnessed, but the audience must be willing to view that justification from an altered stance.The film is paced well and the cast is excellent, with special kudos to Elijah Wood, Claire Forlani, Marc Warren, Charley Hunnan, and to the fine supporting cast members including Leo Gregory as the unfortunate snitch, Terence Jay as the coke-addicted Harvard roommate, and a large cast of 'firm members' whose fighting techniques are well choreographed and captured by cinematographer Alexander Buono.  Like THE FIGHT CLUB this film is not for all audiences, but the messages underneath all of the violence are well worth thought.

Little does he know that this new land will have a different language, strange local customs, and an incredibly great potential for danger.Upon arrival he links up with a great fighter named Pete (Charlie Hunnam) whose lineage traces back to the legendary rulers of previous times.  As a leader of men and singer of old folk songs that boost his Green Street Elite gang, his firm of cockney hooligans - most notably his right hand man Bower who has links to current warlord leadership - into a frenzy as they fanatically cheer on the greater numbers of West Ham warriors in their ongoing power and land struggle, for a precious reputation that would dominate all firms.  Frail and timid initially, Buckner eventually embraces his violent survival instincts, becoming incrementally invigorated with each successive victory building towards a showdown versus the dark forces of Millwall and their cruel, black-hearted Dark Lord, Tommy Hatcher (Geoff Bell), who wishes to wage war and kill the GSE leadership.Punctuated by an epic final battle, a cacophony of vicious thudding blows, like a sledgehammer crushing a pile of wet newspaper, the GSE must protect not only their reputation and their firm, but also their loved ones.Green Street Hooligans is a brilliant look inside the world of English football hooliganism, with powerful yet never gratuitous violence, mesmerizing performances all around, and a heart-wrenching finale that exposes the difficult moral choices presented to those who would defend honor at all costs.

My husband and I weren't buying it.Unlike THE FOOTBALL FACTORY, which is inspired by Martin King's books  about his life as a hooligan, this seems more inspired by Bill  Buford's ""Among the Thugs,"" which was 90 percent about a gullible  American Anglophile who learned very little about the thugs in his  years of tagging along with them.The movie was more fantasy about belonging and being accepted by true Brit hooligans.As for the Elijah Wood character, he's never been in a fight before and  then on his first trip to Merry Olde, he wails on a member of  Birmingham's Zulu army? Yeah, yeah... it strained our suspension of disbelief.We kept trying to figure out  why we should care about this Harvard brat.The movie seems to borrow heavily from Football Factory (about  Chelsea's firm), with the ICF boys waiting in anticipation then  yelling in joy when West Ham draws Millwall at home. It also followed one of the thugs as he coached a loveable children's team, a lot less interesting than THE FOOTBALL FACTORY'S children's match between clubs coached by a Chelsea fan and a Millwall fan.Since there are relatively few hooligan movies out in the States and  none about the ICF, there was no need to borrow scenes or cover the same ground.We think they'd have done better just making Cass Pennent's  ""Congratulations"" or Colin Ward's ""Steaming In"" into a movie, or if you absolutely  HAD to have an American main character just make Buford's AMONG THE  THUGS into a movie, at least you could laugh at Buford as thugs pull his chain by telling him more and more outrageous stories and laugh behind his back.So far its the worst of the bunch I think, there's lots of tears as characters wrestle with their inner feelings, more hollywood than Saturday afternoon football.If you must have light entertainment rent it, otherwise run out and get THE FOOTBALL FACTORY instead.

""A New Yorker""","[5, 6]","This is one strong and compelling film that's probably been hidden from a lot of viewers and lucky enough I wasn't one of them. I also thought it was very interesting to learn about the organization of ""The Firms,"" I never knew such a thing existed either. Before I seen this film I thought of Hooliganism as a bunch of young drunken idiots, who like to pick fights, etc...... but that clearly wasn't the case. As an American, I struggled a bit with the heavy British accents but I pick up on it really fast and this shouldn't be any reason for the film to be held back especially what it entails.Elijah Wood, as Matt, plays a ""Yank"" in London and gets sucked into a kind of friendship that you just do not walk into lightly. He plays the off centered role very well and is clearly a departure in character that begs Hollywood planning in not playing the nice guy after all that the public knows him for, namely ""Lord of the Rings."" (Also seen in departure from this role in ""Sin City,"" where he shows his mettle). Elijah has done this role very well at standing back and letting the story unfold around him, and not trying to take the spotlight. The cast is neatly assembled from well known, and not so well known, British actors and most give a five star performance.  Claire Forlani's emotional performance rang very true. Leo Gregory was excellent, managing to make me loathe him, and then breaking my heart all in one film! Charlie Hunnam was good, but in that naturalistic way that makes it look as though no actual acting is going on!  The fight scenes, while clearly disturbing, did not bother me so much.  There is a lot of violence, mostly out of shot and stylized into fast motion photography, but it works well in making you try to hide and, at the same time, face up to the supposed life of part of UK football society.Some have said that they found the end scene in which Matt confronts his college roommate to be gratuitous, but I did not. Matt was demonstrating the he was not to be messed with, while stopping short of physical harm, and it wrapped up the movie's theme nicely for me.

Worse still, a cracker and a glass of water-- not too exciting.I got it with a free movie voucher. My lady saw the box and wasn't too excited, but it was Sunday night and we both had to be up in the morning for work. It really didn't matter.I slid the disc in. Right off we're in a tiled subway between bickering gangs. Words erupt into violence. Snapshots of wet, pummeled faces piss blood at the screen. Then the action cuts to a Harvard dorm.Matt Buckner (Wood), a journalism student, is packing, expelled, framed for cocaine possession by his well-connected roommate. He flies to England to live with his sister Shannon (Claire Forlani) and her husband Steve (Marc Warren). Pete (Charlie Hunnam), Shannon's brother-in-law, heads a hooligan ""firm"" called GSE (The Green Street Elite). Enroute to a ""football"" (soccer) game, Matt and Pete run into rival hooligans. Outnumbered, Matt's first impulse is to run. But Pete lives by the Hooligan code called ""stand your ground"" and Matt is caught in the middle of a hot free-for-all. His instincts take over in the confusion and he fights. His face and knuckles are red and torn in the aftermath, however he learns something college could never teach him. From this point Matt embraces mob violence and Pete becomes his hero.GREEN STREET is like FIGHT CLUB, and unlike it. They're well shot. The fights aren't pretty but effectively real and scary. Both films are visceral with enough personal and social issues to make the action meaningful.  Creative cinematography. CGI in HOOLIGANS is used mainly in the fight scenes. FIGHT CLUB used these effects to create a dreamlike phantasm and fuse reality with the main character's (Norton's) imagination. And this is what makes GREEN STREET different: everything's in the real world. Norton, in FIGHT CLUB, constructed an imaginary persona to live through; Wood's hero Pete (Charlie Hunnam) is real. Yin and yang run through both films and the characters playing them are all authentic. For instance, Pete of GREEN STREET expresses a broader range of humanity than Pitt's character in FIGHT CLUB. This is because other people and circumstances aside from hooliganism affect him. Pitt in FIGHT CLUB doesn't have other people to bounce off of. With Wood and Norton the differences are obvious. In FIGHT CLUB, Norton's aggressive alter-ego was always there simmering until Pitt (Tyler Durden) materialized. With Wood there was never a sense of anything building-- Pete happens out of nowhere.I would recommend this film very highly and rank it up there with REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. Yes this film's that good. And pay close attention to Charlie Hunnam (Pete). I compare his performance to DeNiro's first film MEAN STREETS; he's very, very good. And Wood is surprisingly effective in his performance as a foil to Hunnam's gritty persona.

Bernabo,"[1, 2]","I am not sure how many movies it will take for Elijah Wood to put ""The Lord of the Rings"" behind him, and I have little doubt that he will succeed in doing so (unlike, say, Mark Hamill and Luke Skywalker), but he is not there yet.  However, it seems clear that ""Green Street Hooligans"" is an attempt to do so on the part of the actor.  He plays Matt Buckner, editor of the student paper at Harvard, who is kicked out of sky short of graduation because his roommate forces makes him take the fall for the cocaine found in their room.  This is a problematic idea because Buckner is hung out to dry as a dealer, although there would no evidence that he uses and even less that he ever sold drugs to anybody.  For that matter, what would he being doing with the drugged out son of a politician for a roommate?  Even if Buckner chooses not to defend himself, which is indeed his course of action, somebody at Harvard has to be smart enough to notice his roommate is a better candidate.But this prologue is necessary because it casts Buckner adrift in the world.  His mother is dead and his father is a world-class journalist whose answering machine is the only point of contact.  So with no where else to go, Buckner jets across the pond to visit his sister, Shannon (Claire Forlani), who is now married and recently had a baby.  Her husband is Steve Dunham (Marc Warren), who has romantic plans for an evening out and therefore dumps Buckner on his younger brother, Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam), who does not need the dead weight of some American because West Ham is playing a football game.  Now the football team might be mediocre, Pete tells Buckner, but their firm, the Green Street Elite, are first rate, not so much as die hard football fans, but as football hooligans.  Hence the difference between the GSE that Pete and his mates talk about and the ""Green Street Hooligans"" of the film's title.Wood certainly took this role to help get him past Frodo because as his character gets caught up in the hooliganism of Pete and the GSE, it turns out he likes the violence, or at least the reputation he has become of his involvement in the fights.  Originally his accent brings scorn and physical attack, but then comes the point when it brings the respect as people recognize he is the Yank who runs with the GSE.  In the vacuum of his life adrift, such things are quite intoxicating, and that is without adding all the ale downed at the pub frequented by the firm.  Continuing to keep a journal, Buckner is aware of the paradox that he has never been closer to danger in his entire life, yet he feels more confident than he ever has before.  So there is a reason why director Lexi Alexander would want Wood at the character whose entrance into this violent we follow as audience members.  If Pete can get hooked on violence, then apparently it could happen to anyone, and this film invites us to think that we too could be out there singing ""I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles"" song in all of its ironic glory.Despite the problems of the initial set up, which is admittedly mainly a plot contrivance by Alexander and her co-writers Dougie Brimson and Josh Shelov to cast Buckner adrift so he can float into this particular world, it is the way the end game plays out that ultimately hurts this 2005 film.  It turns out that Shannon's husband used to be the leader of the GSE, but something horrible happened and he has promised not to go back to the life.  But in trying to watch out for his brother-in-law, whose identity as a ""journal"" is revealed and threatens his life, Steve ends up at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong person in attendance.  Thus begins a chain of events that put the wrong people in imminent danger and require changes of allegiance and personal sacrifices to avoid an even worse ending than what happens during the big fight at the climax of the film.  Even in the world of football hooliganism the realization that things are going too far should have been obvious at least a minute earlier, if not years earlier, than it is here.  I like the choice Buckner makes at the end for getting his life back on track, because we are motivated to want him to take the other road.  But ""Green Street Hooligans"" is a movie where the main character explicitly lays out the moral of the story in voiceover just to make sure we know what we are to take away from watching this one.",4,Frodo gets kicked out of Harvard and becomes an English football hooligan,1150243200,"06 14, 2006",2006,4402,"['am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'will', 'take', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'put', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'have', 'little', 'doubt', 'will', 'succeed', 'doing', 'so', 'say', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'not', 'there', 'yet', 'However', 'clear', 'Green', 'Street', 'Hooligans', 'attempt', 'do', 'so', 'part', 'actor', 'Matt', 'Buckner', 'editor', 'student', 'paper', 'Harvard', 'who', 'kicked', 'sky', 'short', 'graduation', 'roommate', 'forces', 'take', 'fall', 'cocaine', 'found', 'room', 'problematic', 'idea', 'Buckner', 'hung', 'dry', 'dealer', 'would', 'evidence', 'even', 'less', 'ever', 'sold', 'drugs', 'anybody', 'matter', 'what', 'would', 'being', 'doing', 'drugged', 'son', 'politician', 'roommate', 'Even', 'Buckner', 'not', 'defend', 'indeed', 'course', 'action', 'somebody', 'Harvard', 'be', 'smart', 'enough', 'notice', 'roommate', 'better', 'candidate.But', 'prologue', 'necessary', 'Buckner', 'adrift', 'world', 'mother', 'dead', 'father', 'world-class', 'journalist', 'answering', 'machine', 'only', 'point', 'contact', 'So', 'where', 'else', 'go', 'Buckner', 'jets', 'pond', 'visit', 'sister', 'Shannon', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'who', 'now', 'married', 'recently', 'had', 'baby', 'husband', 'Steve', 'Dunham', 'Marc', 'Warren', 'who', 'romantic', 'plans', 'evening', 'out', 'therefore', 'dumps', 'Buckner', 'younger', 'brother', 'Pete', 'Dunham', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'who', 'not', 'need', 'dead', 'weight', 'American', 'West', 'Ham', 'playing', 'football', 'game', 'Now', 'football', 'team', 'might', 'be', 'mediocre', 'Pete', 'Buckner', 'firm', 'Green', 'Street', 'Elite', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'die', 'hard', 'football', 'fans', 'football', 'hooligans', 'Hence', 'difference', 'GSE', 'Pete', 'mates', 'talk', 'Green', 'Street', 'Hooligans', 'film', 'title.Wood', 'certainly', 'took', 'role', 'help', 'get', 'past', 'Frodo', 'character', 'caught', 'up', 'hooliganism', 'Pete', 'GSE', 'out', 'violence', 'least', 'reputation', 'become', 'involvement', 'fights', 'Originally', 'accent', 'brings', 'scorn', 'physical', 'attack', 'then', 'point', 'when', 'respect', 'people', 'recognize', 'Yank', 'who', 'GSE', 'vacuum', 'life', 'adrift', 'such', 'things', 'are', 'quite', 'intoxicating', 'adding', 'ale', 'downed', 'pub', 'frequented', 'firm', 'Continuing', 'keep', 'journal', 'Buckner', 'aware', 'paradox', 'never', 'been', 'closer', 'danger', 'entire', 'life', 'more', 'confident', 'ever', 'before', 'reason', 'why', 'director', 'Lexi', 'Alexander', 'would', 'want', 'Wood', 'character', 'entrance', 'violent', 'follow', 'audience', 'members', 'Pete', 'can', 'get', 'hooked', 'violence', 'then', 'apparently', 'could', 'happen', 'anyone', 'film', 'think', 'too', 'could', 'be', 'out', 'there', 'singing', ""'m"", 'Forever', 'Blowing', 'Bubbles', 'song', 'ironic', 'glory.Despite', 'problems', 'initial', 'set', 'up', 'admittedly', 'mainly', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'Alexander', 'co-writers', 'Dougie', 'Brimson', 'Josh', 'Shelov', 'cast', 'Buckner', 'adrift', 'so', 'can', 'float', 'particular', 'world', 'way', 'end', 'game', 'out', 'ultimately', '2005', 'film', 'out', 'Shannon', 'husband', 'used', 'be', 'leader', 'GSE', 'something', 'horrible', 'happened', 'promised', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'life', 'trying', 'watch', 'out', 'brother-in-law', 'identity', 'journal', 'revealed', 'life', 'Steve', 'up', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'wrong', 'person', 'attendance', 'Thus', 'chain', 'events', 'put', 'wrong', 'people', 'imminent', 'danger', 'require', 'changes', 'allegiance', 'personal', 'sacrifices', 'avoid', 'even', 'worse', 'ending', 'what', 'big', 'fight', 'climax', 'film', 'Even', 'world', 'football', 'hooliganism', 'realization', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'obvious', 'least', 'minute', 'earlier', 'not', 'years', 'earlier', 'here', 'choice', 'Buckner', 'end', 'getting', 'life', 'back', 'track', 'are', 'motivated', 'want', 'take', 'other', 'road', 'Green', 'Street', 'Hooligans', 'movie', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'explicitly', 'out', 'moral', 'story', 'voiceover', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'take', 'away', 'watching', 'one']",N/A

Matt disguises the fact that he studied journalism at Harvard, but cannot hide the fact that Pete knows that Matt's father is one of the most revered journalists in the world.  After hanging out with Pete for one night, Matt becomes involved with the football ""firm"" GSE, or Green Street Elite, an extremely strong firm headed by Pete.  They back the team West Ham United, and their rivals are the Millwall firm, headed by an insane Major named Tommy Hatcher (Geoff Bell), who lost his mind after watching his twelve year old son get trampled ten years ago by the GSE.  Within a short time, Matt severely changes from being the weak Harvard boy to a hard edged, tattooed hooligan, willing to risk everything to fit in with the GSE.  Everyone takes a liking to the Yank, except Bovver (Leo Gregory), who never really trusts Matt.  Bovver is Pete's right hand man, and a bit of jealousy ensues when Matt begins to integrate into the group.  Matt proves himself in battle time and time again, but never gains the trust of Bovver.  The gang, with the help of Bovver, slowly begins to discover who Matt really is, and the climax is filled with so much emotion and conflict, and the writers bring Steve back into the picture just in time to have an explosive conclusion.The casting of Green Street Hooligans is top notch.  After reading Roger Ebert's review of the film, I began to ask similar questions about the necessity of Matt, and the casting of Elijah Wood, but I think Ebert makes a good point: ""At first I thought the character of Matt was unnecessary. Why not simply dramatize the world of firms? Do we need a Hollywood star as an entry point for non-British audiences? If you must have one, Elijah Wood seems so very unlikely as a street fighter that I began a list of more plausible actors for the role. Then I realized the movie's point is that someone like this nerdy Harvard boy might be transformed in a fairly short time into a bloodthirsty gang fighter. The message is that violence is hard-wired into men, if only the connection is made. As someone who has never thrown a punch in my life, I find that alien to my own feelings, but I remember years ago, late on nights of drinking, when anger would come from somewhere and fill me. Certainly alcoholism is essential for firm membership: It is inconceivable that anyone would go into action sober.""  At first glance, Matt does indeed seem an unecessary character, but after thought, this decision does benefit the film in an extremely positive way.  Anyone can be attracted to gangs like these, much the same in America with street gangs.  They create a sense of belonging.  This film is very insightful, although I cannot say much for the accuracy of the portrayal of the firms, as I do not live in England.  What I know is that this is a powerfully explosive, violent, and bloody film that never stops being entertaining.  It's fast-paced, hard-edged entertainment that never lets up.",4,"It's Football, not Soccer",1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,3382,"['being', 'kicked', 'Harvard', 'taking', 'blame', 'roommate', 'cocaine', 'habit', 'Matt', 'Buckner', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'jolly', 'old', 'England', 'visit', 'sister', 'Shannon', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'husband', 'Steve', 'Dunham', 'Marc', 'Warren', 'soon', 'out', 'England', ""n't"", 'so', 'jolly', 'Steve', 'brother', 'Pete', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'Matt', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'English', 'hate', 'more', 'Yanks', 'police', 'journo', 'journalists', 'Matt', 'fact', 'studied', 'journalism', 'Harvard', 'can', 'not', 'hide', 'fact', 'Pete', 'Matt', 'father', 'one', 'most', 'revered', 'journalists', 'world', 'hanging', 'out', 'Pete', 'one', 'night', 'Matt', 'involved', 'football', 'firm', 'GSE', 'Green', 'Street', 'Elite', 'extremely', 'strong', 'firm', 'headed', 'Pete', 'back', 'team', 'West', 'Ham', 'United', 'rivals', 'are', 'Millwall', 'firm', 'headed', 'insane', 'Major', 'named', 'Tommy', 'Hatcher', 'Geoff', 'Bell', 'who', 'lost', 'mind', 'watching', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'get', 'trampled', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'GSE', 'short', 'time', 'Matt', 'severely', 'being', 'weak', 'Harvard', 'boy', 'hard', 'edged', 'tattooed', 'hooligan', 'willing', 'risk', 'everything', 'fit', 'GSE', 'Everyone', 'liking', 'Yank', 'Bovver', 'Leo', 'Gregory', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'Matt', 'Bovver', 'Pete', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'bit', 'jealousy', 'ensues', 'when', 'Matt', 'integrate', 'group', 'Matt', 'battle', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'never', 'gains', 'trust', 'Bovver', 'gang', 'help', 'Bovver', 'slowly', 'discover', 'who', 'Matt', 'really', 'climax', 'filled', 'so', 'much', 'emotion', 'conflict', 'writers', 'bring', 'Steve', 'back', 'picture', 'just', 'time', 'have', 'explosive', 'conclusion.The', 'casting', 'Green', 'Street', 'Hooligans', 'top', 'notch', 'reading', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'review', 'film', 'began', 'ask', 'similar', 'questions', 'necessity', 'Matt', 'casting', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'think', 'Ebert', 'good', 'point', 'first', 'thought', 'character', 'Matt', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'Why', 'not', 'simply', 'dramatize', 'world', 'firms', 'Do', 'need', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'entry', 'point', 'non-British', 'audiences', 'must', 'have', 'one', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'so', 'very', 'unlikely', 'street', 'fighter', 'began', 'list', 'more', 'plausible', 'actors', 'role', 'Then', 'realized', 'movie', 'point', 'someone', 'nerdy', 'Harvard', 'boy', 'might', 'be', 'transformed', 'fairly', 'short', 'time', 'bloodthirsty', 'gang', 'fighter', 'message', 'violence', 'hard-wired', 'men', 'only', 'connection', 'made', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'thrown', 'punch', 'life', 'find', 'alien', 'own', 'feelings', 'remember', 'years', 'ago', 'late', 'nights', 'drinking', 'when', 'anger', 'would', 'come', 'somewhere', 'fill', 'Certainly', 'alcoholism', 'essential', 'firm', 'membership', 'inconceivable', 'anyone', 'would', 'go', 'action', 'sober', 'first', 'glance', 'Matt', 'indeed', 'seem', 'unecessary', 'character', 'thought', 'decision', 'benefit', 'film', 'extremely', 'positive', 'way', 'Anyone', 'can', 'be', 'attracted', 'gangs', 'much', 'same', 'America', 'street', 'gangs', 'create', 'sense', 'belonging', 'film', 'very', 'insightful', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'much', 'accuracy', 'portrayal', 'firms', 'do', 'not', 'live', 'England', 'What', 'know', 'powerfully', 'explosive', 'violent', 'bloody', 'film', 'never', 'being', 'entertaining', 'fast-paced', 'hard-edged', 'entertainment', 'never', 'up']",N/A

944030,A3Q07NIIS6V2CT,B000BKTBVI,"Mia N. Searles ""The Muses Circle""","[0, 1]","Green Street Hooligans is one of those rare gems that I have heard other people talking about here and there but never got around to watching it. I was in FYE the other day and saw the dvd sitting on the shelf for $6.99 and figured it was a sign since a few months ago I couldn't get the movie for under $12.99 (hey, I am a collector so I know when to be cheap and when to suck it up and buy a flick, hehe).That being said, while I am years late in watching the movie, I am at least proud of myself for viewing it within 48 hours of its purchase. I have to admit that the two main lead actors are part of the reason for my quick watch time.Elijah Wood (of Lord of the Rings fame as well as many older films in which he starred as a child such as The Good Son) plays Matt Muckner, a talented Harvard grad student that is wrongfully expelled two months before he is supposed to receive his diploma. I am not going to get into the reason for his expulsion because that would be giving away too much of the plot. Suffice to say, after this devastating blow he has nothing better to do then to take a trip to London where his sister Shannon resides with her English husband and their toddler son. While his sister is happy to see him, there is definitely a tension between them and it is revealed that the siblings have had a rough childhood together with the loss of their mother and their almost estranged father.Before the siblings can really get reaquainted, Shannon's husband Steve comes home from work. He doesn't seem to have any issues with Matt's sudden arrival but tells him when they have a moment alone that he had something special planned for him and his wife. And this is when we are introduced to Charlie Hunnam's character, Pete, Steve's younger rebel brother. Pete comes through the back door into the kitchen like a storm, without knocking and without hesitation. He is there to ask his big brother for some money, something that you can tell he does quite often. Steve is obviously annoyed because of the tension Pete creates in Shannon and the dripping sarcasm he uses towards Matt. But Steve gets his little revenge by making Pete ""babysit"" Matt so that he can spend quality time with his wife. On the way out the door he gives Matt money and tells him no matter what, do NOT give Pete the loot. Within seconds of both young men venturing outside and down the street, Pete tries to intimidate Matt in giving him the cash. Surprisingly, Matt holds his ground even when it turns a little physical.Pete says, "" So I'm guessing you're not much of a fighter?""Matt's surprised reply: ""Fighter? That's probably the first fight I ever had.""""You call that a fight,"" Pete says with amusement.Although Pete tries to get Matt to stay behind, he allows him to tag along. From that moment on, the Alpha and Omega become nearly inseparable. Pete's close knit friends are not so acccepting, however, when Matt seems to be invited to not only their favorite pub but to football (aka soccer in the US) games. It is one particular football game that changes not only the views of Pete's friends but how Matt views Pete. After watching the West Ham United v Birmingham City match, Matt decides to go home instead of hanging with the group after the game. On his way, Matt soon realizes he is being followed and is accosted by some thugs. He is relieved when Pete and the gang appear and a bloody fight ensues. It is during this fight that Matt discovers this is no ordinary skirmish and Pete is no ordinary rebellious punk. He is brutally introduced into the world of 'firms,' football team followers that show their loyalty by finding ways to humiliate the other team's firm and vicious fighting in the streets. And Pete? Leader of the GSE, Green Steet Elite 'firm'.While most of Pete's 'firm' begin to grudgingly respect Matt after he proves himself in a brutal fight, Bovver, Pete's closest mate seems to seeth with jealousy. He feels that Matt, who is American, cannot be trusted and even goes as far as to accuse Pete and Matt of being gay since they are always seen together. Pete being the bold leader that he is defends Matt and tells Bovver that he is getting tired of his accusations and wasted energy. However, Bovver's animosty proves fatal...One reason I gave this movie a 5 out of 5 star rating is because of the two lead actors. After Elijah Wood starred in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, there is no doubt that he could have continued to do high budget movies with fluffy scripts (not saying LOTR is fluffy). Instead, Wood chose to carve his own path in the acting world by picking scripts that challenged him. I think I read a review from a critic that said Elijah Wood was not a good casting choice for Green Steet Hooligans because he seemed out of place. Umm, well, I must disagree because...isn't that the point? The movie is about an American Harvard student that moves to England and gets involved in the violent, mysterious world of football firms. Elijah Wood IS American and in real life would seem out of place if he were to go over to England for a visit. I mean the movie wouldn't have been believable if they had chosen..say, Orlando Bloom to play the part of Matt Muckner. Sometimes I really wonder about about critics...Who fascinated me more was Charlie Hunnam's performance as the GSE leader Pete. For those of you who have never heard of Charlie Hunnam, you may recognize him as that famous hot biker Jax Teller from the hit FX television show Sons of Anarchy. I guess the reason why I am so blown away by his acting is because I first saw Charlie in a little British television series called Queer As Folk (a very controversal show that later prompted the US to create their own provactive Queer As Folk series). He played Nathan, the young underage virgin who falls for and catches the eye of playboy bachelor Stuart. Yes people, Charlie Hunnam played a very daring role as a gay teenager. Even though this is where I first saw him, I did not recgonize him as Jax Teller in Sons of Anarchy for quite awhile. Charlie obviously is older now and sports an American/Californian (where the show takes place) accent in his current role. It wasn't until I had gone onto imdb.com to check out his filmography that I put the connection together. Charlie Hunnam is a prime example of an actor that has gone ""gay"" and still maintains a successful career. I hate to even bring that up since I am a big fan of gay cinema but let's face is, while it is a little more common now for big actors to accept gay roles, 10 years ago it was not so common or even accepting. Then again, I have to keep reminding myself that Charlie is from England and people in Europe generally do not have the issues we do when it comes to gay cinema. Anyway, I digress...my point is, Charlie Hunnam is an actor that is not afraid to go from one extreme to the next. He blew me away in Queer as Folk and Sons of Anarchy, two completely different shows and characters and I have to admit that he is probably one of the biggest reasons why I wanted to see Green Street Hooligans. While SOA and GSH do share some similarities, it was interesting to see him back in a role where he is in his own country with his own accent (well, sort of his own accent since I know that different parts of England have different dialects). And yes, I do know that Green Street Hooligans was shot a few years before Sons of Anarchy but I have been so imersed in his character Jax Teller that I easily forgot his background. He is that believable as an actor and while SOA Season 3 is on the horizon (September 7th baby! Woohoo!) I can't wait to see the outcome of other projects he is working on. B-)While the actors are largely responsible for my 5 star rating, the original script and gritty scenes make up the other half. In an era where movies are either remakes, sequels, or book adaptations, I'm sure not the only one who somehow feels jaded going into a film. I'll be the first to admit that I sometimes have that ""I've seen em' all"" attitude. At times I will sit at the computer for hours, searching for that one movie that sounds different, looks different, feels different. I know some people have compared this movie to Fight Club and I do see the similarities. However, up until this film, I had no idea what the hell a 'firm' was. And if it wasn't for me watching the 2010 World Cup I probably wouldn't have known how serious football (aka soccer) is to the people of England. The way Americans feel about baseball and football is the way they feel about soccer. We just don't have baseball or football firms here...or do we? I can remember quite a few times watching a baseball game and the camera shooting to a fight that broke out in the stands or hearing on the channel 6 news that fans were arrested at a game for getting too out of control. Hmm, I wonder if this is a phenomenon that somehow the American government has covered up >=)~I could sit here and complain about the low budget but I went into it knowing that GSH is an Indie flick and most if not all Indie flicks are low budget. This may sound strange but sometimes when I know I'm about to watch a movie that struggled to be made because of the lack of funds, it takes some of the pressure off. Instead of me focusing on the visual affects and the special affects, I realize the only thing that is going to hold my interest for the next 90 minutes (or more) is the story that's about to unfold and the acting that brings it to life.Green Street Hooligans brings something fresh and originial to the screen because of its mysterious and talented main lead actors and ability to keep you interested despite its obvious low budget, Indie feel. Oh and going back to my comment about sometimes feeling jaded while watching movies...this film also has a couple of surprise shockers that I did not see coming. I could blame that on being tired since I did pop the movie in at 2:30am but I'd like to think I was genuinely surprised.**Note** Just to give you a heads up before I forget, the ""Cockney"" accents (no offense intended) in this movie may be hard to follow especially if you are tired going into this movie as I was so if you have the dvd you can put the English substitles on.",5,Great Flick With

In Green Street Hooligans Elijah Wood's character Matt Buckner goes from promising undergrad at Harvard with two months left to street tough kid in London.  I know what your thinking, Elijah Wood, as a tough guy, give me a break, and although he doesn't exactly pull it off greatly it doesn't distract from the movie.  Picture the part in Good Will Hunting towards the beginning when Will and his friends get into a brawl in the park and Gerry Rafferty's song Baker Street is playing, Green Street Hooligans is basically that on and off for the whole movie.Matt takes the fall for something his roommate did, figuring his family being rich and powerful there wouldn't be a point in putting up a fight and gets expelled.  He travels to London to visit his sister and her family which he hasn't met yet.  Soon Matt gets involved with his sisters husbands brother Pete Dunham played by Charlie Hunnam.  Hummam brings a charismatic swagger to his character  which makes him a convincing and believable leader in the film.  Pete Dunham is a history teacher by profession, but his main priority is leading his soccer firm the GSE (Green Street Elite).  Soccer firms are groups of friends kind of like gangs that support their teams, watch their friends backs, drink beer, and build their reputations usually from fighting and humiliating other firms.  Think an unconscious version ofFight Club (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)with soccer hoods that have various professional day jobs.  The GSE's main rival is Millwall, Matt asks like the Yankees and the Red Sox?  Pete replies more like the Israelis and Palestinians.  Mainly the movie is trying to say stand your ground but ultimately know when to fight and when to walk away.The movie is pretty unrealistic in a way which anyone that has been in a few fights can attest to.  For example these guys pound on each other and break bottles over each others heads yet all of their bruises are in an attractive kind of way via the cut above the eye with blood just trickling down while you look all intense.  Also, they drink tons of brew but are all in shape or have chiseled abs.  I imagine the real GSE to have missing teeth, disfigured noses, and beer bellies.  Still, Green Street Hooligans is a cool and entertaining movie.DVD Features:-The Making of Hooligans-Terence Jay One Blood Music Video (good song)",4,Good Will Hunting in Reverse.

944033,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000BKTBVI,mirasreviews,"[36, 38]","""Green Street Hooligans""  sets a family drama and coming-of-age tale in the world of football (soccer) hooliganism. Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood) was a promising journalism student before he was expelled from Harvard University over his roommate's cocaine stash. Suddenly aimless, Matt wanders to London to visit his sister Shannon (Claire Forlani) and her British husband Steve (Marc Warren). When Matt tags along to a soccer game with Steve's brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam), he finds that there is a lot more to soccer culture than the game on the field. Pete is a member of a football firm or gang called the Green Street Elite (GSE). Firms are organizations of fanatic fans who battle other firms for reputation and dominance -by beating the crap out of each other. Matt is attracted to the high energy, danger, and physicality of the GSE and embraces the lifestyle. But eventually word gets around that he might be a journalist - and hooligans hate coppers and journalists.I couldn't say how accurately ""Green Street Hooligans"" represents the dynamics of football firms or the relationships of their members. But the film does provide a window into a subculture that is common in the UK and South America, where soccer reigns supreme, but which Americans may never have heard of. Contrary to the American cocept of gangsters, soccer hooligans are neither Mafioso nor errant youth. They are grown, middle-class men who function perfectly well in normal jobs. But outside of work and domestic obligations, they are completely lawless. They happily adopt a brutality that could leave them dead or maimed in the blink of an eye. ""Green Street Hooligans"" requires some suspension of disbelief to accept more mundane behavior. Would Steve really send his nave Yank brother-in-law to a soccer game with his estranged hooligan brother? No. That kind of illogic is common in this film. But the culture of hooliganism, the allure of their violence, is at the same time stupid and fascinating.The DVD (Warner 2006): ""The Making of Hooligans"" (6 min) is not about making the movie. It is a series of interviews with actors Elijah Wood, Claire Forlani, Charlie Hunnam, director Lexi Alexander and producer Deborah Del Prete which discuss the characters and the phenomenon of football firms. There is a music video for the song ""One Blood"" by Terence Jay, which sounds uncannily like the Dire Straits' song ""Brother in Arms"". Terence Jay also acts in the movie. He plays Matt's elite WASP Harvard roommate, the cokehead.

The story is told through the eyes of an American Harward journalism major who had recently dropped out of school taking the fall for a rich fellow student.The environment he met when he landed in England was nothing he had ever seen across the pond - when fanatical support of an English football (not soccer- he learned fast) club was used as an excuse to arrange organized gang fights against opposing teams supporters. Much like in Fight Club the overiding objective of these supporters, organized in something they call 'firms', was not the game itself, but the raw ultra violent fighting that ensued.The firms (they did not see themselves as gangs) operated as homes for the members and upheld a wapped view on themselves - denouncing random violence on innocents somehow justifying the violence as acceptable in their own minds. Most had real jobs on the side and 'merely' saw this as a hobby dominating their lives after work. The firms did deliver a social system for the members, all of which found respect and loyalty among the other members which even at times appealed to the intellectually superior American visitor.The characterizations were very realistic with solid acting performances leading the thoughts back to one of my all time favorites, Trainspotting.This little movie comes highly recommended despite its quite raw violence at times.",4,Fight Club meets Trainspotters,1255132800,"10 10, 2009",2009,1513,"['did', 'not', 'have', 'expect', 'much', 'sliding', 'movie', 'DVD', 'player', 'as', 'often', 'case', 'are', 'surprised', 'positively', 'when', 'expectations', 'are', 'low', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'American', 'Harward', 'journalism', 'major', 'who', 'had', 'recently', 'dropped', 'school', 'taking', 'fall', 'rich', 'fellow', 'student.The', 'environment', 'met', 'when', 'landed', 'England', 'was', 'nothing', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'pond', 'when', 'fanatical', 'support', 'English', 'football', 'not', 'soccer-', 'learned', 'fast', 'club', 'was', 'used', 'excuse', 'arrange', 'organized', 'gang', 'fights', 'opposing', 'teams', 'supporters', 'Much', 'Fight', 'Club', 'overiding', 'objective', 'supporters', 'organized', 'something', 'call', ""'firms"", 'was', 'not', 'game', 'raw', 'ultra', 'violent', 'fighting', 'ensued.The', 'firms', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'gangs', 'operated', 'homes', 'members', 'upheld', 'wapped', 'view', 'denouncing', 'random', 'violence', 'innocents', 'somehow', 'justifying', 'violence', 'acceptable', 'own', 'minds', 'Most', 'had', 'real', 'jobs', 'side', ""'merely"", 'saw', 'hobby', 'dominating', 'lives', 'work', 'firms', 'did', 'deliver', 'social', 'system', 'members', 'found', 'respect', 'loyalty', 'other', 'members', 'even', 'times', 'appealed', 'intellectually', 'superior', 'American', 'visitor.The', 'characterizations', 'were', 'very', 'realistic', 'solid', 'acting', 'performances', 'leading', 'thoughts', 'back', 'one', 'time', 'favorites', 'Trainspotting.This', 'little', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'quite', 'raw', 'violence', 'times']",N/A
944035,A1FY6ETS4ZPCUE,B000BKTBVI,Mr. Mambo,"[2, 3]","There's a good section in Bill Buford's book on hooliganism, Among the Thugs, where Bill is questioned by a high ranking police officer, who is curious about American football.Police: ""Is it true that a typical American football game lasts 3 hours or more, even though the actual time of the game by the clock is only 60 minutes?""Buford: ""True"".Police: ""And is it also true that each fan in the stadium has his or her own seat?""Buford: ""Also true""Police: ""And is it also true that the vast majority of fans remain in those seats for the duration of the game?""Buford: ""Correct""Police: ""And is it true that there are rarely incidents of fan violence during the games?""Buford: ""Yes, it hardly ever happens, and if it does, the disturbances are quickly stopped.""The police officer simply shook his head in amazement.In thinking about this, isn't it a bit ironic that in our violent U.S. gun  culture, where thousands upon thousands of Americans are murdered with handguns each year, we have virtually no violence or deaths during any sporting events. And in England, where guns are almost impossible to obtain, fan violence and even deaths during football matches are a given.Anyway, that's a matter for the social workers and psychologists.This movie examines English football violence in a pretty accurate way. It's far from a great movie--it has too many cliches and it's tough for me to buy the elfin Elijah Wood as even a pretend Yank hooligan--but if you are fascinated by English football and it's violent subculture, check this one out.

""I almost care.""","[12, 23]","When films are this bad, your humble reviewer is in a quandary.Go full hit and expound manifold reasons why said work stinks like a dead whale, or curtly dismiss it - therefore saving words, phrases and ideas for reviews which better merit the processes of their conception.It really doesn't take much perception or insight to be able to judge 'Green Street' as the worst kind of film that gets made today. An idiotic mish-mash of social commentary and glaring example of Hollywood's deep obsession/understanding of the darker side of all things culturally British.Ie, Find a subject that they think is cinematic/appealing to people's baser principles, go to 'authentic' locations, hire 'local' actors, and finally, plonk a well-known American in the lead, so in theory, you have something which appeals to everyone.But, and it's a big but, for this to work you need a few things in your favour:You need a decent script, you need the director to at least be alive, and you need the cast to be on top of their game. 'Green Street' doesn't have any of these. In spades.Some proof? I HATE lists, but they're all that 'GS' deserves.1) The script. It would take too long to convey how bad it is, so some examples:If you're a footie thug, one of your major essentials on a match-day is avoiding the police. Drunkenly screaming your heads off down the tube will get you surrounded in seconds.On occasion, the film looks like an ad for Lacoste trainers. Most hooligans don't wear whites because it shows blood up too easily if the cops are looking for them later. Wow, research? Duh.There's no football 'lad' IN THE WORLD, who, on seeing his brother's new baby, will start singing ""I'm West Ham til I die!!!"" at the top of his voice. Being teenage in a film is one thing, being completely infantile is another.There are no pubs in London where you can stand on tables, sing like donkeys, and lash lager all over each other without burly bouncers forcibly removing you and the cops closing the place down within 48 hours.All this, and more, in the first 15 minutes! Sets the tone early on, and it never recovers.2)The director. Where to start. The violence (and let's face it, that's the only reason we're watching this nonsense) is handled al la Van Damme: shamelessly contrived (are fights ALWAYS between equal numbers?) and bar-room.Drunken louts fly through the air, blood squirts in slow motion, cameras glide and zoom. Oh blah blah. Tiresome beyond the box-office. Clueless use of (tepid anyway) music on the soundtrack. Nave and stereotypical use of locations. On and on and on...(zzzzz.... reviewer needs caffeine).3)The 'star'.(Ie. The review's meat, as opposed to the script being the spuds, and the director the veg!) In this case it's a hottie, Elijah Wood, fresh from a scary trip to Doom Mountain and being careless with some bling.I swear to you he's asleep throughout the film. It's obvious to all that he's asked his agent to find him a role as far removed from the Shire as is possible. His agent says ""British football hooligans!!"" and Elijah says ""I'll do it""What he didn't do was check the script - he foolishly signed up blind and lived to regret it. He's awake long enough to look lost, bemused and incredulous all at the same time before he reverts back to his state of torpor and prays for shooting to finish so he can cash his cheque and get on the first plane out. Back to Trippin' AM (undisputed queen of the fan-girls!!), and his next embarrassing mis-cast as Iggy Pop!Weedy, sleepy, snoozy, contractually obliged. Bless him. ""I'm not feeling too good, I wanna go home"" he slurs at one stage. You and me both, mate.The rest of the cast go from being slightly worse than EJ, to being absolutely dreadful. Accents slip from posh acting school to Cockney, and back again in bewildering fashion. None of them look remotely hard, the nearest they've got to Chelsea is when Major Daddy took 'em down to Kensington to look at apartments.Some of these guys might just make decent lucky-chimney-sweeps at weddings when the acting work dries up (Start booking now!).The only female in the cast is a looker (yay! A positive! I nearly gave it another star for that) but she provides worthy competition to the blokes in the scene-chewing, chronic over-acting competition.It's close, but the guys win on points.This genre cries out for a passionate director and a believable script. Maybe one day a definitive football thug movie will be made, but it will have to be the polar opposite of 'Green Street' in just about every aspect.Comatose from start to painful end, it's difficult to see why such visual (and visceral!) subject matter falls so miserably at every hurdle. You'd think it would inspire scorching cordon bleu film-making, instead of the half-baked, week-old meat pie 'b's that it actually does.And that's about as fair as I can be to a ludicrous work of elaborate fiction masquerading as caustic social artifact.",1,"'Hey Pete, got any jobs going?'",1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,4932,"['When', 'films', 'are', 'bad', 'humble', 'reviewer', 'quandary.Go',

I wanted very much to see Charlie Hunnam in this though, so I rented it. I had to laugh when I found myself hoping someone would kill off one particular little traitor in the film. I just completely got swept up in it. I so wish I'd known about this one when it was in the theatres as I'm sure I would have seen it there more than once.Pete (Charlie Hunnam) charms his way into your heart within his first two minutes of screen time.

You're rooting for GSE and totally invested in what's going on almost before you know it.I did not see the Lord of the Rings movies, so I didn't have to overcome any preconceived notions to enjoy Elijah Woods' performance. He's unassuming and completely believable as Matt. Charlie Hunnam, however, does a phenomenal job and really makes the movie. His stance, walk, look, accent, everything is different in this film and it works really well. I cannot wait to see him as the lead in something else.Until then, I'll happily keep watching this one. I've already ordered my own copy to keep.Great movie all around - fun, exciting, touching, and makes you think and feel long after it's over. Excellent performances. It's just very, very well done.As for the violence, I only had to turn away briefly during the final fight scene.

Elijah Wood plays an American journalism student who gets expelled from Harvard for something he didn't do.  He ends up going to London to stay with his sister (Claire Forlani), who he hasn't seen in years.  He meets her new husband and baby.  When her husband introduces Wood's character to his own brother, Wood ends up learning about football (or soccer, as he calls it) and getting caught up in being a hooligan with the West Ham supporters in East London.This turns out to be a pretty entertaining movie, but it's also very gruesome.  There are several fight seens and lots of blood.  The plot isn't entirely believable just because there's no way a real firm, which is similar to a street gang, would accept an outsider to easily, but it's obvious they had to cut some corner to fit the entire story into a two hour film.The actors do a good job, especially Charlie Hunnam who is the leader of the gang and becomes Wood's friend.  Casting Wood seems a bit strange because he's small and doesn't look like much of a fighter, but he makes the role believable.This film will most likely upset a lot of people.

944049,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BKTBVI,Tsuyoshi,"[18, 19]","Of everything written about this small film starring Elijah Wood and Charlie Hunnam, the most interesting is to see the lukewarm reactions from the UK side, which found the film is too violent, and dismissed it as implausible. And it must be admitted that they are complaining with some good reasons.For the film is really violent, and Elijah Wood may be the least plausible choice for making a film about the hooligans, almost fanatic supporters of football team in England. Elijah Wood plays Matt, a Harvard college undergraduate student wrongly expelled because of his irresponsible roommate. Matt flies to the home of his married sister (Clair Forlani), and there meets his brother-in-law Pete (Charlie Hannam), devoted leader of the Green Street Elite, bunch of the hooligans supporting West Ham United.The set-up part is contrived, but you should wait a while. Soon the film's story leads us to its gist, about how Matt (estranged from his father now in Kabul) finds his new existence in this underworld of the `Firm' and its hooliganism. The film does not fail to show the complexity of the characters. The members of the `Firm' have jobs to do when there is not a game (believe me nor not, one of them is an airplane pilot by profession), and not exactly bad guys at all, but when it comes to football games and the rivalry between the Firms, they turn fierce and unstoppable street fighters who have their own rules to follow. You cannot say the script is an in-depth study of hooligans, but still good enough to make us care its characters.Besides its violent scenes, the criticism we hear against `Green Street Hooligans' is about its cast, Elijah Wood in particular. Yes, the star of blockbuster hit `Lord of the Rings.' Throughout `GSH' Elijah Wood never looks like a hooligan. For all Matt's repeated bloody fights, he still looks a visitor or outsider in the Green Street Elite, but that is the point of the film because he is there to provide the viewpoint from an outsider. And some UK reviewers complained about the accent of Charlie Hunnam. I don't know because I do not have much linguistic knowledge, but to me his acting as charismatic Pete looked very good (though Leo Gregory as discontented GSE member is more impressive, as you will see).More serious problem with `Green Street Hooligans' is its incredible and too convenient coincidences in the story, which makes the whole film too melodramatic. Matt happens to have done two (or more) things, which results in a big problem. The far-fetched situation looks totally out of place among the gritty descriptions of hooliganism, and Claire Forlani's character always remains a typical lady-in-distress image, which is another clich&eacute; in the filmmaking. German-born director Lexi Alexander sticks to the realistic approach to the street fight sequences (with blood and dirty words), but she somehow is content with the autopilot direction when showing several episodes that are not directly related to hooligans.But I was intrigued with the main story about the friendship between males, or kind of combat camaraderie depicted in `Green Street Hooligans.' I know this is not the only film about hooliganism - for example, `The Football Factory' and `The Firm' (starring Gary Oldman, not Tom Cruise) - but `Green Street Hooligans' is worth a look even though you don't know football for its strong and compelling main story.",4,Violent and Compelling Look at the London Underworld,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,3402,"['everything', 'written', 'small', 'film', 'starring', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'most', 'interesting', 'see', 'lukewarm', 'reactions', 'UK', 'side', 'found', 'film', 'too', 'violent', 'dismissed', 'implausible', 'must', 'be', 'admitted', 'are', 'complaining', 'good', 'reasons.For', 'film', 'really', 'violent', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'may', 'be', 'least', 'plausible', 'choice', 'making', 'film', 'hooligans', 'almost', 'fanatic', 'supporters', 'football', 'team', 'England', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Matt', 'Harvard', 'college', 'undergraduate', 'student', 'wrongly', 'expelled', 'irresponsible', 'roommate', 'Matt', 'home', 'married', 'sister', 'Clair', 'Forlani', 'there', 'brother-in-law', 'Pete', 'Charlie', 'Hannam', 'devoted', 'leader', 'Green', 'Street', 'Elite', 'bunch', 'hooligans', 'supporting', 'West', 'Ham', 'United.The', 'set-up', 'part', 'contrived', 'should', 'wait', 'while', 'film', 'story', 'gist', 'how', 'Matt', 'estranged', 'father', 'now', 'Kabul', 'new', 'existence', 'underworld', 'Firm', 'hooliganism', 'film', 'not', 'fail', 'show', 'complexity', 'characters', 'members', 'Firm', 'have', 'jobs', 'do', 'when', 'not', 'game', 'believe', 'not', 'one', 'airplane', 'pilot', 'profession', 'not', 'exactly', 'bad', 'guys', 'when', 'football', 'games', 'rivalry', 'Firms', 'turn', 'fierce', 'unstoppable', 'street', 'fighters', 'who', 'have', 'own', 'rules', 'follow', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'script', 'in-depth', 'study', 'hooligans', 'still', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'care', 'characters.Besides', 'violent', 'scenes', 'criticism', 'hear', 'Green', 'Street', 'Hooligans', 'cast', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'particular', 'Yes', 'star', 'blockbuster', 'hit', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'GSH', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'never', 'hooligan', 'Matt', 'repeated', 'bloody', 'fights', 'still', 'visitor', 'outsider', 'Green', 'Street', 'Elite', 'point', 'film', 'there', 'provide', 'viewpoint', 'outsider', 'UK', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'accent', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'linguistic', 'knowledge', 'acting', 'charismatic', 'Pete', 'looked', 'very', 'good', 'Leo', 'Gregory', 'discontented', 'GSE', 'member', 'more', 'impressive', 'will', 'see', '.More', 'serious', 'problem', 'Green', 'Street', 'Hooligans', 'incredible', 'too', 'convenient', 'coincidences', 'story', 'whole', 'film', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'Matt', 'have', 'done', 'two', 'more', 'things', 'results', 'big', 'problem', 'far-fetched', 'situation', 'totally', 'place', 'gritty', 'descriptions', 'hooliganism', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'character', 'always', 'typical', 'lady-in-distress', 'image', 'clich', 'eacute', 'filmmaking', 'German-born', 'director', 'Lexi', 'Alexander', 'sticks', 'realistic', 'approach', 'street', 'fight', 'sequences', 'blood', 'dirty', 'words', 'somehow', 'content', 'autopilot', 'direction', 'when', 'showing', 'several', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'directly', 'related', 'hooligans.But', 'was', 'intrigued', 'main', 'story', 'friendship', 'males', 'kind', 'combat', 'camaraderie', 'depicted', 'Green', 'Street', 'Hooligans', 'know', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'hooliganism', 'example', 'Football', 'Factory', 'Firm', 'starring', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'not', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Green', 'Street', 'Hooligans', 'look', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'football', 'strong', 'compelling', 'main', 'story']",N/A

944051,AIMVE29PE7WHE,B000BKTBVI,viki*g,"[0, 1]","A couple years ago my friends were obsessed with this movie, and i never knew why! I then heard it was about &#34;football&#34; or soccer in England, so I was even more hesitant ( I hate having to watch movies when i can't understand a word that is coming out of their mouths!) Plus i can't stand Elijah Wood, I'm not a fan of ANY of the LOTR films. OK now, well I saw one day that it was on one of my movie chanels, so i watched it.... and Oh my freakn goodness, it is one of my favorite movies of all times now! Definetly in my top 10 movies that i can watch over and over again! Charlie Hunnam is 1, a gorgeous man, i can not stop watching Sons of Anarchy! Best show on T.V. 2, he is so talented and brilliantly cast in this movie. In fact, Elijah was actully very good in it too. The movie is funny at times, violent, (which I like, don't judge me...lol!) and a tear jearker, which i was not expecting! I still get goosebumps when i watch it! This is the 4th copy that i have had to buy, i have let friends borrow it, and they have either &#34;lost&#34; theirs or i just haven't gotten it back! i was so excited when i heard about a sequel, i watched it, it wasn't too, too bad. Then they made a third, which was released only on the web aparenlty, i've seen some clips... they looked great! Now i just read they are actually in production making a real 3rd one, fingers crossed!
