1033121,A1AUOVXPT5MYX4,B000KDZTIK,"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx""","[10, 11]","Revolver is one of those movies that the audience will find really hard to define. I can't remember a single film with a more mixed reception. A lot of people must think it's a total mess. Some consider it average or too confusing to be good enough. Some think it's a masterpiece. But of course you're gonna say. There isn't a single movie that wouldn't have that, right? Well, not with Revolver people. Don't take my word for it, but check out the user ratings in detail and you will see that the voters are absolutely scattered about this one. Although it doesn't have a high rating average, the majority still gave it the highest possible vote.Snatch (Widescreen Edition)has been the only Guy Ritchie movie I've seen so far. The first couple of ten minutes I've walked into Revolver I expected something similar. There he is, Jason Statham again with a pack of other criminals and that familiar smell of gangsters teasing and playing tricks with each other again. Nothing unusual for a Ritchie movie so far. Only later you see that Ritchie is more of a Bryan Singer this time than he is his usual self. Jason Statham plays a guy named Jake Green. He just got out of prison where he's been for the past seven years and is obviously already looking for trouble. He came to a casino to play a few games with a man named Mr. Macha (Ray Liotta) who also owns the place. Jake wins the game but on his way out he collapses down the staircase for apparently no reason. Mr. Macha wasn't too happy about Mr. Green showing up in his casino. Because he feels deceived he orders his men to take Mr. Green and his associates out. But something strange happens (again) and Jake Green is the only one that survives the shooting, saved by a man he sees for the first time in his life. Jake doesn't know why he's saved, Macha doesn't know why Jake isn't dead. But you feel as if someone knows everything.If I would try to write a more exhaustive intro you wouldn't read this comment till bed time. There is so much going on in this movie. Where do I start? Well the performances, especially by Statham and Liotta are really convincing. They are both really familiarized with their roles. Andr&eacute; Benjamin wasn't something I expected but he seemed to have a smarter role than he usually does. The rest of the cast was awesome and played an essential role in the movie. What I will most likely remember about this film are some really outstanding scenes. The one where Macha is being pushed onto the floor by his bodyguard has to be one of the best scenes in modern-day thriller history. The script is very stirred up and everything is in motion all the time. The mysterious identity of a man called Mr. Gold is yet to be revealed. This is where it goes down somehow. Jake's odd behavior was a put-off and thank god that everything is given more sense in the last few minutes.I would definitely recommend Revolver to fans ofThe Usual Suspects (Special Editon). At times the plot seems identical. Also recommended if you liked L&eacute;on and the rest of Ritchie's films. I think it's best to see this movie without any knowledge about the plot what so ever. A friend recommended it to me, saying nothing else than it's good and very unpredictable. 'It's not like the rest', were his exact words. He wasn't far off. Word of mouth is something really rare when it comes to movies in my life. I usually give recommendations too others. Thank you for that Stojan.",4,"Lots of curves in this one despite it's confusion and familiarity,",1205193600,"03 11, 2008",2008,3447,"['Revolver', 'one', 'movies', 'audience', 'will', 'find', 'really', 'hard', 'define', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'single', 'film', 'more', 'mixed', 'reception', 'lot', 'people', 'must', 'think', 'total', 'mess', 'consider', 'average', 'too', 'confusing', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'think', 'masterpiece', 'course', ""'re"", 'gon', 'say', ""n't"", 'single', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'right', 'Well', 'not', 'Revolver', 'people', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'word', 'check', 'out', 'user', 'ratings', 'detail', 'will', 'see', 'voters', 'are', 'absolutely', 'scattered', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'rating', 'average', 'majority', 'still', 'gave', 'highest', 'possible', 'vote.Snatch', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'been', 'only', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'first', 'couple', 'ten', 'minutes', ""'ve"", 'walked', 'Revolver', 'expected', 'something', 'similar', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'again', 'pack', 'other', 'criminals', 'familiar', 'smell', 'gangsters', 'teasing', 'playing', 'tricks', 'other', 'again', 'Nothing', 'unusual', 'Ritchie', 'movie', 'so', 'far', 'Only', 'later', 'see', 'Ritchie', 'more', 'Bryan', 'Singer', 'time', 'usual', 'self', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'guy', 'named', 'Jake', 'Green', 'just', 'got', 'prison', 'where', 'been', 'past', 'seven', 'years', 'obviously', 'already', 'looking', 'trouble', 'came', 'casino', 'play', 'few', 'games', 'man', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Macha', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'who', 'also', 'place', 'Jake', 'game', 'way', 'down', 'staircase', 'apparently', 'reason', 'Mr.', 'Macha', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'happy', 'Mr.', 'Green', 'showing', 'up', 'casino', 'deceived', 'orders', 'men', 'take', 'Mr.', 'Green', 'associates', 'out', 'something', 'strange', 'happens', 'again', 'Jake', 'Green', 'only', 'one', 'shooting', 'saved', 'man', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'Jake', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'saved', 'Macha', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Jake', ""n't"", 'dead', 'feel', 'someone', 'everything.If', 'would', 'try', 'write', 'more', 'exhaustive', 'intro', 'would', ""n't"", 'read', 'comment', 'till', 'bed', 'time', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'movie', 'Where', 'do', 'start', 'Well', 'performances', 'especially', 'Statham', 'Liotta', 'are', 'really', 'convincing', 'are', 'really', 'familiarized', 'roles', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Benjamin', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', 'expected', 'seemed', 'have', 'smarter', 'role', 'usually', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'awesome', 'played', 'essential', 'role', 'movie', 'What', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'remember', 'film', 'are', 'really', 'outstanding', 'scenes', 'one', 'where', 'Macha', 'being', 'pushed', 'floor', 'bodyguard', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'modern-day', 'thriller', 'history', 'script', 'very', 'stirred', 'up', 'everything', 'motion', 'time', 'mysterious', 'identity', 'man', 'called', 'Mr.', 'Gold', 'yet', 'be', 'revealed', 'where', 'down', 'somehow', 'Jake', 'odd', 'behavior', 'was', 'put-off', 'thank', 'god', 'everything', 'given', 'more', 'sense', 'last', 'few', 'minutes.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Revolver', 'fans', 'ofThe', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Special', 'Editon', 'times', 'plot', 'identical', 'Also', 'recommended', 'liked', 'L', 'eacute', 'rest', 'Ritchie', 'films', 'think', 'best', 'see', 'movie', 'knowledge', 'plot', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'friend', 'recommended', 'saying', 'nothing', 'else', 'good', 'very', 'unpredictable', 'not', 'rest', 'were', 'exact', 'words', 'was', ""n't"", 'far', 'off', 'Word', 'mouth', 'something', 'really', 'rare', 'when', 'movies', 'life', 'usually', 'give', 'recommendations', 'too', 'others', 'Thank', 'Stojan']",Revolver (2005) (Region 2)

There is a good deal of stylized action, but the script centers around some pretty profound spiritual and pyschological concepts. The essential theme will be quickly apparent to most students of religion, although the ending might prove a revelation to those with conventional ideas about the forces of good and evil. It's a well written film and Guy Ritchie does an okay job of bringing it to life, but only just. The major downfall of this film is Andre Benjamin. He's completely out of his depth in his role and his performance is painfully awkward and stilted. Ray Liotta tries to compensate by giving a somewhat over-the-top but nevertheless excellent performance. And Jason Statham is his usual brooding, menacing self. The visual style is generally good, although there is one stylized animated sequence that's jarringly out of place. On the whole, its passable, and it's worth a rent, if only for some of its thought-provoking ideas",3,A little food for thought,1271721600,"04 20, 2010",2010,1019,"['Anyone', 'expecting', 'typical', 'Ritchie/Statham', 'shoot', 'up', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'good', 'deal', 'stylized', 'action', 'script', 'centers', 'pretty', 'profound', 'spiritual', 'pyschological', 'concepts', 'essential', 'theme', 'will', 'be', 'quickly', 'apparent', 'most', 'students', 'religion', 'ending', 'might', 'prove', 'revelation', 'conventional', 'ideas', 'forces', 'good', 'evil', 'well', 'written', 'film', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'okay', 'job', 'bringing', 'life', 'only', 'just', 'major', 'downfall', 'film', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'completely', 'depth', 'role', 'performance', 'painfully', 'awkward', 'stilted', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'compensate', 'giving', 'somewhat', 'over-the-top', 'nevertheless', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'usual', 'brooding', 'menacing', 'self', 'visual', 'style', 'generally', 'good', 'one', 'stylized', 'animated', 'sequence', 'jarringly', 'place', 'whole', 'passable', 'rent', 'only', 'thought-provoking', 'ideas']",Revolver (2005) (Region 2)
1033123,A2RPZ4DT6O7TBG,B000KDZTIK,A.R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","Guy Ritchie is easily one of my favorite directors.  After being introduced to ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"" in high school by my best friend my cinema sphere increased ever so slightly and (save for ""Swept Away"") I have since gone onto to watch all of Guy Ritchie's films.  The very first time I watched ""Revolver"" I didn't get it, and thus I didn't like it.  (Higher thought at its finest, eh?)However, the other evening my girlfriend and I sat down and watched it.  It was her first viewing and my second, but with a fresh perspective and several years this viewing was revelatory.  I would also like to mention that I had also just finished the game ""Bioshock Infinite,"" which touches on topics of a similar nature.  Except, in ""Bioshock"" the protagonist, Booker DeWitt, faces his own ego in the literal sense-an alternate version of himself, divulged from a single event.  I find this important, because with my mind still reeling from the plot of ""Bioshock Infinite,"" perhaps my mind was more open to a film concerning the confrontation of one's ego.The top layer plot of ""Revolver"" is fairly straightforward, especially when considering Ritchie's past films.  It follows Jake Green (Jason Statham) after a seven-year stint in solitary.  During his time in solitary he `meets' the prisoners in the cells on either side of his due to the interception of secretly passed notes via daily book drops.  One of the aforementioned prisoners is a chess master, the other a master con artist.With the promise of the three of them escaping together, Green shares quite a bit of personal information with the other two cellmates.  Eventually, the chess master and the master con artist escape without Jake, leaving him in solitary for another two-years.  Upon Jake's release he discovers that all of his money and worthy-belongings have been taken by the two other prisoners and any hint of them is two-years old.However, he was imparted one gift from them-a working game theory.  Essentially, it is a list of rules that govern the literal and figurative `game.'  They can be applied to win chess, poker, or any game of chance, but given the right person they could be used to control events, scenarios, and the outcomes of life.Some backstory: Jake Green was put away because of Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta), and after learning the `rules' from the chess master and master con artist, he builds up his own personal wealth again after being released from prison.  After enough time and money has been built, Green decides to enact his revenge against Macha by humiliating him and conning him out of some money.Green is successful, but this singularity sets off a chain of events that inevitably pits Macha against Green, involves the unseen Mr. Gold, and includes the mysterious chess player and con artist from Green's past in a film that not only tells of rival gangsters and loan sharks, but one that pits men against themselves in a battle of wits and ego.""Revolver"" is stunningly shot.  There are some truly superb moment of cinematography that play into Ritchie's British, gangster-flick wheelhouse perfectly.  However, ""Revolver"" isn't your typical gangster film.  The plot isn't as twisty or grandiose as Ritchie's past endeavors, but it instead focuses on the more surreal.  The heart of the plot is in Green's confrontation of his ego and Macha's embrace of his.  What are the consequences of this, and how can we separate ourselves from our own worst enemy-our ego?It's an immense topic to tackle, but Ritchie pulls it off with some clever writing and some amazing cinematography.  If you want something a little trippy and surreal with a crime flavor check out Guy Ritchie's ""Revolver.""",4,Review: Revvolver,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",2013,3712,"['Guy', 'Ritchie', 'easily', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'being', 'introduced', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Two', 'Smoking', 'Barrels', 'Snatch', 'high', 'school', 'best', 'friend', 'cinema', 'sphere', 'increased', 'ever', 'so', 'slightly', 'save', 'Swept', 'Away', 'have', 'gone', 'watch', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'films', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'Revolver', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'thus', 'did', ""n't"", 'Higher', 'thought', 'finest', 'eh', 'However', 'other', 'evening', 'girlfriend', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'was', 'first', 'viewing', 'second', 'fresh', 'perspective', 'several', 'years', 'viewing', 'was', 'revelatory', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'mention', 'had', 'also', 'just', 'finished', 'game', 'Bioshock', 'Infinite', 'topics', 'similar', 'nature', 'Bioshock', 'protagonist', 'Booker', 'DeWitt', 'own', 'ego', 'literal', 'sense-an', 'alternate', 'version', 'divulged', 'single', 'event', 'find', 'important', 'mind', 'still', 'reeling', 'plot', 'Bioshock', 'Infinite', 'perhaps', 'mind', 'was', 'more', 'open', 'film', 'concerning', 'confrontation', 'one', 'ego.The', 'top', 'layer', 'plot', 'Revolver', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'especially', 'when', 'considering', 'Ritchie', 'past', 'films', 'Jake', 'Green', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'seven-year', 'stint', 'solitary', 'time', 'solitary', 'meets', 'prisoners', 'cells', 'side', 'due', 'interception', 'secretly', 'passed', 'notes', 'daily', 'book', 'drops', 'One', 'aforementioned', 'prisoners', 'chess', 'master', 'other', 'master', 'con', 'promise', 'three', 'escaping', 'together', 'Green', 'shares', 'quite', 'bit', 'personal', 'information', 'other', 'two', 'cellmates', 'Eventually', 'chess', 'master', 'master', 'con', 'artist', 'escape', 'Jake', 'leaving', 'solitary', 'two-years', 'Jake', 'release', 'money', 'worthy-belongings', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'two', 'other', 'prisoners', 'hint', 'two-years', 'old.However', 'was', 'imparted', 'one', 'gift', 'them-a', 'working', 'game', 'theory', 'Essentially', 'list', 'rules', 'govern', 'literal', 'figurative', 'game', 'can', 'be', 'applied', 'win', 'chess', 'poker', 'game', 'chance', 'given', 'right', 'person', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'control', 'events', 'scenarios', 'outcomes', 'life.Some', 'backstory', 'Jake', 'Green', 'was', 'put', 'away', 'Dorothy', 'Macha', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'learning', 'rules', 'chess', 'master', 'master', 'con', 'artist', 'up', 'own', 'personal', 'wealth', 'again', 'being', 'released', 'prison', 'enough', 'time', 'money', 'been', 'built', 'Green', 'enact', 'revenge', 'Macha', 'humiliating', 'conning', 'money.Green', 'successful', 'singularity', 'off', 'chain', 'events', 'inevitably', 'Macha', 'Green', 'unseen', 'Mr.', 'Gold', 'mysterious', 'chess', 'player', 'con', 'artist', 'Green', 'past', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'tells', 'rival', 'gangsters', 'loan', 'sharks', 'one', 'men', 'battle', 'wits', 'ego', 'Revolver', 'stunningly', 'shot', 'are', 'truly', 'superb', 'moment', 'cinematography', 'play', 'Ritchie', 'British', 'gangster-flick', 'wheelhouse', 'perfectly', 'However', 'Revolver', ""n't"", 'typical', 'gangster', 'film', 'plot', ""n't"", 'twisty', 'grandiose', 'Ritchie', 'past', 'endeavors', 'instead', 'more', 'surreal', 'heart', 'plot', 'Green', 'confrontation', 'ego', 'Macha', 'embrace', 'What', 'are', 'consequences', 'how', 'can', 'separate', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy-our', 'ego', 'immense', 'topic', 'tackle', 'Ritchie', 'off', 'clever', 'writing', 'amazing', 'cinematography', 'want', 'something', 'little', 'trippy', 'surreal', 'crime', 'flavor', 'check', 'out', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'Revolver']",Revolver (2005) (Region 2)
1033124,A1WVEHODRT07LO,B000KDZTIK,"Atinuke Abayomi-Paul ""Tinu""","[5, 5]","This is a thinking man's action picture. If you simply want to be entertained, it's not for you. Huge difference between a film not being ""for you"" and it being a bad film though.In essence, it's an exploration of ego. Deeper explanations would ruin the movie for you. There's plenty of shooting and interesting crime world characters. I think what makes people uncomfortable with the movie is two things. 1- They're caught up in their ego and don't want to admit it. 2- It's just not a straightforward formulaic Hollywood flik. It's just not.  3- They don't ""get"" it.I hate it when I don't get a movie and don't know where to turn at the end too, but the director deals with this. When you're done watching the  film, stay for the credits and listen carefully, it's spelled out for you. Repeated viewings and director commentary reveal the film on additional levels.Some say it's a pretentious film, but that isn't true either, not by definition of the word. It doesn't come across as trying to appear more important than it is. In fact, the struggle of the ego, whether internal or external, is THE most important battle any of us faces. Ego maturity is directly related to whether and how we evolve, learn or grow. Honestly, what in your life is more important to you than you?Jason Statham dug a little deeper than usual for this performance. Andre 3000 was a little bland in line delivery, but in overall portrayal, awesome. Lots of good lines in here too. But take note that the books it claims to quote from or reference don't all exist.See this when you're feeling introspective, or when you're ready to take your exploration of self to the next level.

1033131,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,B000KDZTIK,Brian,"[1, 1]","I understand those who lose patience with the abstract nature of Guy Ritchie's 'Revolver'-- which is miles departed from his bread-and-butter beginnings, the ultra-hip Brit-gangster revivals 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch'-- and wish to wash their hands of his third crime feature entirely. But if you're thrown by its central conceit and have even the vaguest desire to understand what it's about, do yourself a favor and listen to the director's commentary track. I admit I really enjoyed this bizarre little headgame of a film without any analysis, and I was wary of sitting through Ritchie's explanation of his own work, fearing that a) he would come across as a pretentious twit, or b) he would ruin my enjoyment of the thing by revealing exactly how badly his creative intentions missed the intellectual mark. To my great relief, though, his insights are funny, self-effacing and, the biggest surprise of all, enlightening. Turns out he really did his homework putting 'Revolver' together and, while it certainly isn't the holy grail of cinematic achievement, its visual style, narrative and psychological themes do indeed marry neatly, which is why the movie bears repeat viewing. So whether you're into decoding metaphors and anagrams, exploring the many invisible facets of the ego, or just appreciate a slick action flick with oddball characters and rich imagery, click on the commentary and give 'Revolver' a second spin (your conceptualized self will love it, anyway).

1033137,AS558SNWF1DXG,B000KDZTIK,Clare Quilty,"[4, 10]","Guy Ritchie's previous British crime thrillers have their detractors, but they also have an amiable charm and cocky intelligence that are hard to resist.This new one, however, is not like the others.This is a movie that's so wound up, so pumped full of macho barium, that it eventually becomes an excruciating experience.Ritchie stretches out this time -- both in terms of plot and ambition -- and loads the movie with more style than all his previous movies combined. Wild sets and characters? Yes. Grandiosity that approaches Greenaway? Yes. Operatic in sound and scale and peppered with an occasionally cool shoot-out? Sure.But it's all shot through with a plot so intentionally convoluted, and Luc Besson production style so brassy and arranged, that watching ""Revolver"" quickly becomes like flipping through the ads in Vanity Fair with a 105-degree fever.  And not in a good way, either.In his commentary, Ritchie admits he's playing with the idea of ego and the notion that enemies and competition are all simply a product of the individual's interior desires.  That's a great concept on which to base a crime thriller but the movie is overloaded with too-obvious twists, faux-""Fight Club"" camera tricks and a ridiculously overblown sense of drama. Some scenes that inexplicably involve animation don't help either -- they don't make sense within the story and only serve to draw more comparisons to Tarantino, who did all this first and better within ""Kill Bill.""You know you're in trouble when you're watching a movie and you realize everybody in the film cares way, way more about the situations at hand than you do. In the case of ""Revolver,"" I'm pretty sure the main characters were 210% more concerned with the goings on of the story than I was.Meanwhile, a tangerine-tan Ray Liotta -- as, ostensibly, ""the bad guy"" -- spends most of the movie threatening his underlings and colorfully demanding they kill his enemies. Andre 3000 is joltingly self-conscious as a mysterious loan shark. And lead Jason Statham wanders through it all knowing his character is being played by some kind of scam, but submitting anyway. We know this because he spends the bulk of a seemingly endless voiceover reiterating what's already painfully obvious to the viewer.The most interesting part of the film is actually the end credits. That's when Ritchie rolls out interviews with experts and pundits talking about the concept of the ego.

1033139,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B000KDZTIK,C. Sawin,"[2, 3]","English director Guy Ritchie is known best for ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"" amongst longtime fans and the ""Sherlock Holmes"" films were able to help Ritchie stay afloat in the mainstream. While ""RocknRolla"" was considered a return to form for a guy who kept the crime thriller genre extremely close to his heart, his 2005 film ""Revolver"" is easily his most unique project to date. ""Revolver"" is known for having a mixed reputation; a 6.3 on IMDb, a 25/100 on Metacritic, and a dismal 16% rating on RottenTomatoes with the label of ""incoherent"" carved into it and cursed as such. But if you're able to accept a film that purposely doesn't connect all the dots while leaving much to the viewer's interpretation and are able to trudge through and persevere over a truckload of patience and letting your mind wander, then ""Revolver"" is just smart enough to be considered extraordinary.Jake Green (a long-haired and handlebar mustache clad Jason Statham) has just finished a seven-year jail sentence and is now free. The man who put him there, Dorothy Macha (a mostly naked Ray Liotta) has kept busy and is about to become the next big casino boss of the city. After a bold confrontation between the two, Jake walks away with a large chunk of Macha's money but not before blacking out and falling down a flight of stairs. Jake is shot at once he returns home and a few of his friends die in the crossfire. Two men named Avi (Andre Benjamin) and Zach (Vincent Pastore) save Jake and inform him that he suffers from a rare blood disease that'll kill him within three days. If Jake wants to survive, he has to work with Avi and Zach, do whatever they say, and give away every penny he's ever earned without question. Feeling his life slip away with every dollar he gives away with the bitter taste of revenge still caked on his lips, Jake struggles with the thought that he's being conned but pursuing his gut instinct may cost him his life.There are two very different versions of this film. The US version currently available on DVD and Blu-ray is a completely different cut compared to the UK version. Scenes are completely rearranged and edited in entirely opposing ways, but the biggest difference is the ending. The finale is essentially what makes the film and the ending to the UK version is far superior. The US version has actual professors dissecting the human ego playing over the credits that's really interesting and helps put the film in a semi-satisfying perspective, but the ending to the UK version is more exclusive. The film just ends with no credits as this drifting piano tune plays to a black screen during its final moments while the final confrontation between Jake and Macha is completely cut from the US version of the film.""Revolver"" is a story about how much someone's life can be controlled by their ego. Is your ego really who you are or is it just who you think you are? It's been there for so long that it's difficult to distinguish the difference. That ego is obviously very self-absorbed, so greed becomes a factor in a very short amount of time. The Jake Green and Dorothy Macha characters are very similar, if not exactly the same. The difference is one of them gives into their ego while the other triumphs over it. The message the film portrays may vary depending on who you ask, but think of it like this; ""Revolver"" is a journey that isn't about getting rid of your ego. It's about learning how to control it. The Zach and Avi characters are a bit more complicated. Do they illustrate generosity? Are they just an extension of Jake's strengths; chess and cons? The US cut of the film removes a few important Avi lines near the end of the film. One of them being, ""We didn't do this because we like you. We did this because...we are you."" The ""Fight Club"" theory does seem to be the most logical, especially since Zach and Avi know everything about Jake and being in solitary confinement for seven years probably wasn't the best thing for Jake's brain.The film is visually appealing like most of Richie's films. The colors are very rich and absorbing with extreme use of blue, red, and green. The green screen effects seem a little over polished at times as you can tell that no one is ever actually driving on actual roads and the glow of city life, whether it's during the day or night, is overly flashy. It's almost like it's purposely too bright to make it appear dream-like. Actual scenery is very intricate and detailed, especially during Macha's meeting with Lily Walker (Francesca Annis). There's also this intense car accident with Jason Statham that happens in an instant, but then plays backwards and in slow-motion. And more memorable one-liners than you can try to remember in one viewing (""Shine on you crazy diamond because we're all just monkeys wrapped in suits begging for the approval of others.""). The film utilizes animation in a really weird way. It's like it's used to illustrate extreme anger for certain characters (Zach, Macha, and Lord John). Either way, it's only used in the middle of the film for a short period of time.This is the only film that Jason Statham has hair, so it should deserve at least a little credit for that. All joking aside, it's Statham's best performance. His lack of emotion is explained a bit more thoroughly in the UK cut as prison and the loss of his sister-in-law have left Jake completely numb. It's the elevator sequence that makes Statham's performance stand out. Not only is he arguing with himself, but he shows this raw passion that he almost never has the chance to show in anything else that he does. Ray Liotta is incredible, as well. For the most part, Liotta portrays the foul-mouthed gangster you've come to expect from him. But at his core, Macha is a broken, pitiful man who has this undying desire to be feared and respected. Macha breaks down in a few key scenes in the film and Liotta just knocks it out of the park with this fantastic sense of emotional range.Mark Strong is perhaps the most badass he's ever been in any role as Sorter. Sorter is an assassin, who has a reputation for never missing, but his feelings suddenly get in the way and he starts missing when Macha puts a hit out on Jake. Sorter is a quiet man who stutters and is always adjusting his glasses, but he's featured in more than one superb action sequence in the film.Hunting down the UK cut of the film and seeing both versions before passing final judgement on the film is practically required. Other things that were cut from the US release include Jake's history with Macha and the three Eddies (you see Paul (Terence Maynard) torture them but you have no idea who they are). The elevator sequence is also closer to the 1:15:00 mark rather than at the end of the film. Certain lines are cut that bring entire scenes together. The poker table scene at the beginning of the film is slightly longer. The different versions of the film are almost like different experiences entirely.""Revolver"" is not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination, but it also deserves a bit more credit than it's received. People are always complaining that Hollywood never takes any risks and that there's no originality breaking through. Guy Ritchie gave us something different years ago and everyone hated it; didn't even give him any credit for trying. ""Revolver"" is ambitious as hell and has a concept that is rather genius. Its flaws lie within how that's presented and executed. It's like the film can't decide whether to lay everything out in front of the viewer or to pull the rug out from underneath them and let them fend for themselves. What it does allow you to do is piece more and more together with every viewing.There are at least two noteworthy performances here that everyone has just shrugged off over time with a beautiful score that is absolute perfection. ""Revolver"" taps into a struggle everyone faces that only a small few have been able to relate to. It's not that this film isn't a mess, but that mountain of a mess is on top of a shiny gem of a film that is worthy of being admired.",4,Dissecting Guy Ritchie's Revolver,1369872000,"05 30,

His followup ""Snatch"" did nothing to quell the optimism.  This film feels like a parody of those earlier efforts.  I give Ritchie points for trying to extend himself as a filmmaker but his ambition only goes so far.  The quick cut edits induce headaches, the multiple plot threads make you scratch your head, and the narrative is unnecessarily confusing.  Ritchie tries to cover his tracks by utilizing a variety of film styles and throws in a few notable quotations that only underline the pretentiousness of this whole endeavor.

1033143,A2SKHUNCGF9RKR,B000KDZTIK,Dee Mess,"[1, 1]","Not sure how to describe the plot w/o giving too much away. Basically, Jake Green (Statham, with an untrimmed beard and greasy wig) is out for revenge against casino owner/mob boss Dorothy--no, really--Macha (a Snooki-orange Liotta), who set the pieces into place to send Jake to prison years before. He gets out of solitary confinement--having become a chess master, as one does when incarcerated--and wins at Macha's casino, using the Formula learned from two chess masters confined on either side of his cell while in prison. Jake is seemingly on his way... when things get weird.Faced with a life-threatening, mysterious blood disease, Green is approached by two chess-playing loan sharks, Avi (Andr&eacute; Benjamin) and Zach (Vincent Pastore). The two offer him a cure for his disease--in exchange for the use of his winnings from Macha's casino to fund their loan-sharking business.Meanwhile, Macha is trying to wipe out Green and his two new friends before Green can make good on his revenge.Lots of quotes from philosophers and chess masters pepper the cuts between scenes, almost as if Ritchie is reinforcing the ideas that the characters have expressed in their dialogue (or to drop hints as to what's going on). This can be a confusing movie, on the first viewing, but it's not a terrible movie. It's not going out of its way to be arty or pretentious; the story is told in Ritchie's usual round-about way. Only this time, it's not of a bunch of slang-speaking London thugs pulling a caper. The meaning's a bit deeper, here: rejecting the ego and its rules is one of the themes of the film. (""Revolver"" has been called Ritche's ""Kabbalah movie"", as he was heavily influenced by the symbolism of the teachings.) I liked it upon first watching it, but I soon watched it again, just to get a better idea of what was going on amid the twists and turns--this is not a very linear movie. A couple of viewings (and maybe an additional viewing with director commentary) help a lot.Never the biggest Jason Statham fan (though I've seen him in other Ritchie films), I have to say, I enjoyed him here. He gives a quieter, more thoughtful performance than in, say, ""Snatch"". There is action, but those of you expecting ""The Transporter"" might be disappointed.Ray Liotta, as Macha, redefines ""over-acting"": His crime boss is intense, brash and loud, but we also see the inner workings of a man used to getting his own way who's not sure if his luck will hold.I enjoyed Pastore's Zach, but Benjamin as Ari was close to wooden. Maybe he's better elsewhere, but he wasn't very intimidating or interesting, here.As Sorter, the nervous, stuttering hitman, Mark Strong is wonderful (but then, isn't he always?). Sorter is easily my favorite character: Cool under pressure, yet excitable and nebbishy, Sorter never misses, and if you see him pushing up the thick black frames of his glasses, you'd best get out of there. His best scenes are in a restaurant eliminating a drug lord's assassin, silently annihilating the drug lord's men at a strip club, and his ""U-turn"" near the end of the movie.""Revolver"" is not the Guy Ritchie we're used to, but it is worth checking out. If you don't like it, you don't like it--doesn't mean you're not smart enough to get it (as some reviews allegedly imply), it just means that it's not your thing. But it is, in my opinion, well worth a look.

1033145,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000KDZTIK,Galina,"[5, 8]","I've seen four feature films written/directed by Guy Ritchie, two of which I like very much. His first full-length feature ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" shows a lot of energy, creativity, and wit in style which he may not have created but to which he certainly contributed a lot. Immediately, Ritchie was compared to Quentin Tarantino but with all the similarities, Ritchie's debut was a refreshing, lean, original, and very enjoyable on its own merits British mixture of Action Comedies/Gambling Dramas/Crime Thrillers. ""Lock, Stock.."" also introduced Jason Statham with whom Ritchie went on to making two more films and Vinnie Jones, a football player turned an actor. This one was certainly a Hit. Ritchie's next, Snatch, his first movie I saw, is simply marvelous and my favorite. It uses the same broken narrative as Lock and Stock, intertwines numerous plot threads which intersect and play off each other, and follows the characters who are over-the-top deliciously evil, marvelously clueless and always funny. A Big Hit! Then there was ""Swept Away"" which I better skip. Remakes are rarely a good idea, and that particular remake was certainly a bad one. A miss.Now we are coming to ""Revolver"" (2005) that was described as Ritchie's return to the genres he had proved to be the most successful with, Crime / Drama / Thriller but with the psychological and even philosophical twist. Sounded great and I was very exited. The fact that two of the respected film critics rated ""Revolver"" one star and half star, only added to my interest. ""The Revolver"" revolves around Jake Green (Jason Statham with long hair and a beard), a gangster, a gambler, a chess-player, a con-master who had spent seven years in the Solitary Confinement thanks to the crime boss, the Casino owner, Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta) and is out for revenge. It is definitely better than half star or one star. Visually, it is the most polished Ritchie's work, the acting was good, and I really liked it up until 1 hour 27 minutes mark. The final scenes were laughably bad, annoying, devoid of any humor, and tried too hard to finish the movie on some complex metaphysical note regarding the game, the winners, and the losers. The trick Ritchie tried to pull on me was hitting me over the head again and again with the pieces of wisdom such as ""The greatest enemy will hide in the last place you would ever look"", ""in every game and con there's always an opponent, and there's always a victim. The trick is to know when you're the latter, so you can become the former"", and the deepest of them all, ""The greatest con, that he ever pulled... was making you believe... that he is you."" Thanks for trying to enlighten me but I found these quotes rather banal, superficial, and worst of all absolutely not funny. Revolver is a typical example of how a potentially enjoyable movie was ruined by its creator's ambitions to make an ultimate complex metaphysical-psychological magnum opus.",2,"Two hits, two misses, or the greatest trick Guy Ritchie pulled - was almost making me like Revolver.

1033146,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000KDZTIK,Grady Harp,"[27, 29]","When the name Guy Ritchie is attached to a film, the audience can depend on lots of action, violence, crisp dialog, and nail-biting sequences: his films have a 'look' and a manner that could easily be trademarked.  In REVOLVER, Ritchie keeps all of those elements, but also adds the bite of challenging the audience to keep abreast of what is actually happening in the mayhem that unfolds, and it is this new element of psychological twisting of characters that makes the film so successful.  It doesn't hurt that the cast contains some excellent performances by some of the very best actors of the action genre of films.Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison where he has served time in solitary confinement, by his own choice, enabling him to concentrate of the evils of graft and corruption and the deadly games people can play that call for revenge.  He is cocky, wily, and full of tricks as he becomes involved in a master con game with one Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta), the man who was responsible for his imprisonment. Macha  is determined to take Jake down, but Jake falls into a 'partnership' with two bizarre characters - Avi (Andr&eacute; Benjamin) and Zach (Vincent Pastore)- and begins to explore his own identity and apply those surprises to his compulsion to destroy the seemingly implacable Macha. How this redirection of evil and revenge unfolds is the chess game strategy of the film.  To relate more of the plot would destroy the pleasure of the audience participation the film demands.Ritchie wrote the screenplay with Luc Besson and the result is a story that manages to confuse while it entertains. Clever devices of plot turns and bits of philosophy from the most surprising characters flash quickly, enhancing the expected rough and tumble action of Ritchie's previous successes. Jason Statham is thoroughly in his element here, but the surprise performance comes from Ray Liotta who, under Ritchie's direction, turns in probably his best work to date. This is a thinking person's action flick, well made, and well worth watching!

And his latest crime thriller ""Revolver"" is exactly that. It's heavily flawed and utterly ridiculous, but at least it's entertaining. The story, confusing as it is, focuses on Jake Green (Jason Statham), a quick-witted gambler who puts his life on the line when he insults Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta), a powerful casino owner. After Macha orders his ruthless killers to take him out, Jake seeks shelter with two con men offering to protect him in return for his fortune.""Revolver"" is as chaotic as a massive shoot-out in which it's nearly impossible to figure out who's shooting whom. Ritchie's script is a total, pseudo-philosophical mess, digging deep into the intricacies of the human ego. Ritchie also plays around with certain rules and formulas to pull off the ultimate con, but the whole game concept is ludicrously over the top. Meanwhile, the characters spend most of the time tossing around wise rules instead of delivering a coherent exchange of dialogue. ""You can only get smarter by playing a smarter opponent"" or ""The greatest enemy will hide in the last place you would ever look"" are just two of a horde of examples. The film also ends with a major twist, but if you haven't lost track of things or even care enough to stay focused until the end, chances are you won't be surprised.I initially expected more from the actors, but they're certainly not in their best shape. Jason Statham is always good at playing tough guys looking for trouble, and he's undoubtedly the only cast member to put on a good show as Jake Green. Ray Liotta struggles in the role of malicious casino tyrant, but the only intimidating thing is his underwear. He really could've worn more clothes. As for Andre Benjamin and Vincent Pastore, their shallow performances almost go unnoticed.On a more positive note however, ""Revolver"" is incredibly fast-paced and action-loaded. No matter how confusing or ludicrous the plot really is, the movie is stuffed with hot pursuits and crazy shoot-outs, captured stylishly by cinematographer Tim Maurice-Jones. In the end, despite the crippled script, Ritchie's direction and vision give way for some extravagant but compelling sequences that will keep the entertainment boat afloat for 105 minutes. I recommend this flick to Ritchie fans who are glad he dumped ""Swept Away"" and returned to the action genre.",3,"3.5--It's not Ritchie's best, but it's not a total mess either.",1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,2440,"['Guy', 'Ritchie', 'got', 'film', 'business', 'always', 'wanted', 'direct', 'entertaining', 'movies', 'latest', 'crime', 'thriller', 'Revolver', 'exactly', 'heavily', 'flawed', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'least', 'entertaining', 'story', 'confusing', 'focuses', 'Jake', 'Green', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'quick-witted', 'gambler', 'who', 'life', 'line', 'when', 'Dorothy', 'Macha', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'powerful', 'casino', 'owner', 'Macha', 'orders', 'ruthless', 'killers', 'take', 'out', 'Jake', 'shelter', 'two', 'con', 'men', 'offering', 'protect', 'return', 'fortune', 'Revolver', 'as', 'chaotic', 'massive', 'shoot-out', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'shooting', 'whom', 'Ritchie', 'script', 'total', 'pseudo-philosophical', 'mess', 'digging', 'deep', 'intricacies', 'human', 'ego', 'Ritchie', 'also', 'certain', 'rules', 'formulas', 'pull', 'off', 'ultimate', 'con', 'whole', 'game', 'concept', 'ludicrously', 'top', 'Meanwhile', 'characters', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'tossing', 'around', 'wise', 'rules', 'instead', 'delivering', 'coherent', 'exchange', 'dialogue', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'smarter', 'playing', 'smarter', 'opponent', 'greatest', 'enemy', 'will', 'hide', 'last', 'place', 'would', 'ever', 'look', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'horde', 'examples', 'film', 'also', 'major', 'twist', 'have', ""n't"", 'lost', 'track', 'things', 'even', 'care', 'enough', 'stay', 'focused', 'end', 'chances', 'are', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised.I', 'initially', 'expected', 'more', 'actors', ""'re"", 'certainly', 'not', 'best', 'shape', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'always', 'good', 'playing', 'tough', 'guys', 'looking', 'trouble', 'undoubtedly', 'only', 'cast', 'member', 'put', 'good', 'show', 'Jake', 'Green', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'role', 'malicious', 'casino', 'tyrant', 'only', 'intimidating', 'thing', 'underwear', 'really', 'could', ""'ve"", 'worn', 'more', 'clothes', 'Andre', 'Benjamin', 'Vincent', 'Pastore', 'shallow', 'performances', 'almost', 'go', 'unnoticed.On', 'more', 'positive', 'note', 'however', 'Revolver', 'incredibly', 'fast-paced', 'action-loaded', 'matter', 'how', 'confusing', 'ludicrous', 'plot', 'really', 'movie', 'stuffed', 'hot', 'pursuits', 'crazy', 'shoot-outs', 'captured', 'stylishly', 'cinematographer', 'Tim', 'Maurice-Jones', 'end', 'crippled', 'script', 'Ritchie', 'direction', 'vision', 'give', 'way', 'extravagant', 'compelling', 'sequences', 'will', 'keep', 'entertainment', 'boat', 'afloat', '105', 'minutes', 'recommend', 'flick', 'Ritchie', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'glad', 'dumped', 'Swept', 'Away', 'returned', 'action', 'genre']",Revolver (2005) (Region 2)

""Revolver"" has nothing to do with the classic Beatles' albumRevolver [UK], although a little music tie-in might have been interesting.  Jason Statham who achieved superstar status withThe Transporterdoes his usual journeyman's job as our action hero.  But this is where Ritchie throws a bit of a curve, having a bit less action and a bit more contemplation.  [spoiler alert] The film takes the viewer on a journey and winds up showing Statham's Jake Green as schizophrenic, breaking off into two people, an ego-based alter-ego and the outer physical man.  It seems a bit at odds with the very logical performance we see from Statham, but that's my interpretation.  Ray Liotta who won an Emmy for his 2005 guest appearance on TV's ""ER,"" plays Macha, the bad guy crime boss who runs around either in his underwear or with nothing at all in several parts of the film.  Liotta's performance is actually very good, but not particularly connected to the other people in the film.  Andre 3000 from the band OutKast, also known as Andre Benjamin, plays Avi, the brainy criminal who plans crimes like chess matches.  Benjamin has previously been in the filmsFour Brothers (Special Collector's Edition)&Hollywood Homicide.  His sidekick is Zach played by TV's ""Sopranos"" star Vincent Pastore.  Much of the film is a puzzle that the viewer tries to unravel.  Since Ritchie is the screenwriter, we seem to be pitted against him as he feeds us small clues until the final revelation.

The film got generally poor reviews, both on its 2005 UK release and 2007 American re-edited version (which is what I saw). However, I decided to give it a try anyway because I liked his other films. Glad I did, because this film reminded me of the excitement and challenge of films like Robert Altman's ""Images"" and ""3 Women"" (both produced in the 1970s). I take it as a compliment that a director is willing to treat his audience as up for a challenge. How many films from the last decade is that true of?Watching the film is like wandering into a maze and realizing it's going to take some time to figure your way out of it. Ritchie's script plants a lot of clues, and on the DVD commentary he and his editor reveal what the intention of the film was, but that just scratches the surface. It's not hard to ""get"" the film if you're willing to give it some effort (I played it, then heard the commentary track, then played it again). The performances are excellent, the cinematography and scoring both strong. I'm not sure it's quite the work of genius some of its cult admirers claim for it. Some of the allusions Ritchie builds into the film strike me as private conceits, like an Easter egg hunt to see how many the viewer can find. Regardless of their significance, they're fun. For instance, why is the film's heavy (played by Ray Liotta) named ""Dorothy""? A macho tough guy with a woman's name. Well, I have a suggestion. All the way through the third viewing I was thinking of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" because Jake Green is in the position of Dorothy in that film, trapped in a bizarre world attempting to fight a way out of it, only to discover the power to do so lay within him all along. Of course, Dorothy and Jake in this film are alter egos. But who knows whether that is what Ritchie intended?Ultimately, I like ""RocknRolla"" better, but this film is well worth seeing and thinking about.

But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck, and he's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. If anything its problem is that he's trying to throw in too many influences (a bit of Machiavelli, a dash of Godard, a lot of the Principles of Chess), motifs and techniques, littering the screen with quotes: the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims, and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie. Rather than a commercial for Kabbalism, it's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce, chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film's central (somewhat metaphysical) con.The last third is where most of the problems can be found as Jason Statham takes on the enemy (literally) within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people's exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger, but it's got a lot going for it all the same. Not worth starting a new religion over, but I'm surprised it didn't get a US distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary?Along with the original UK cut, the extras on the UK PAL DVD include a good interview with Ritchie and the editor, a standard love-in making of, music video and numerous deleted scenes. Unfortunately a cast and credits list is not included, which considering the absence of any credits on the film is a serious oversight. The US DVD only includes the re-edited US version.",3,Not a crime against cinema by any means,1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,2489,"['total', 'disaster', 'UK', 'critics', 'claimed', 'misunderstood', 'masterpiece', 'few', 'fanboys', 'insist', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'original', 'UK', 'cut', 'Revolver', 'very', 'least', 'admirable', 'attempt', 'add', 'little', 'substance', 'conman', 'capers', 'then', 'nothing', 'more', 'despised', 'ambitious', 'film', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'especially', 'one', 'using', 'gangster/con-artist', 'movie', 'framework', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'name', 'credits', 'producer', 'definite', 'element', ""'Cinema"", 'de', 'look', 'set', 'kind', 'realistic', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'America', 'Britain', 'overlap', 'great', 'couple', 'superbly', 'edited', 'conceived', 'action', 'sequences', 'oozes', 'style', 'mark', 'up', 'disposable', 'entertainment', 'Ritchie', 'clearly', 'do', 'more', 'simply', 'rehash', 'own', 'movies', 'fast', 'buck', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'thinking', 'reading', 'life', 'universe', 'everything', 'anything', 'problem', 'trying', 'throw', 'too', 'many', 'influences', 'bit', 'Machiavelli', 'dash', 'Godard', 'lot', 'Principles', 'Chess', 'motifs', 'techniques', 'littering', 'screen', 'quotes', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'end', 'three', 'minutes', 'epigrams', 'photos', 'corpses', 'mob', 'victims', 'times', 'never', 'read', 'fortune', 'cookie', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'turn', 'movie', 'Rather', 'commercial', 'Kabbalism', 'really', 'more', 'mixture', 'overlapping', 'principles', 'commerce', 'chess', 'confidence', 'trickery', 'most', 'part', 'difficult', 'trick', 'making', 'theosophy', 'accessible', 'hiding', 'film', 'central', 'somewhat', 'metaphysical', 'con.The', 'last', 'third', 'where', 'most', 'problems', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'enemy', 'literally', 'lots', 'ambitious', 'not', 'always', 'entirely', 'successful', 'crosscutting', 'frame', 'contrast', 'people', 'exterior', 'bravado', 'inner', 'fear', 'anger', 'got', 'lot', 'going', 'same', 'Not', 'worth', 'starting', 'new', 'religion', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'US', 'distributor', 'Maybe', 'found', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'intentionally', 'fake', 'tan', 'just', 'too', 'damn', 'scary', 'original', 'UK', 'cut', 'extras', 'UK', 'PAL', 'DVD', 'include', 'good', 'interview', 'Ritchie', 'editor', 'standard', 'love-in', 'making', 'music', 'video', 'numerous', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Unfortunately', 'cast', 'credits', 'list', 'not', 'included', 'considering', 'absence', 'credits', 'film', 'serious', 'oversight', 'US', 'DVD', 'only', 're-edited', 'US', 'version']",Revolver (2005) (Region 2)
1033196,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000KDZTIK,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 11]","Quite frankly, I don't know what Guy Ritchie wanted to do in ""Revolver."" Its tagline, according to IMDb, goes: ""Your mind will not accept a game this big."" OK, but what kind of game does this film really want to play?Anyway, Jason Statham plays our anti-hero, skilled gambler Jake Green. After doing seven years in jail, Jake goes to a casino owner Macha (Ray Liotta) and humiliates him in front of his men, but on his way back he is attacked by the assassins sent by Macha. Luckily Jake is saved by Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr&eacute; Benjamin), but these mysterious guys demand something extraordinary: Jake's money, all of it.I could follow the terribly complicated story so far, but after 30 minuets I started to think: Who cares?For the story goes on and on, but never makes a point. I don't see in what way repeated quotations (from Machiavelli, Caesar, ""Etiquette of Bankers"" and ""Fundamentals of Chess"") have to do with the convoluted story that doesn't know where to go. Jakes' frequent voiceovers are just annoying, and so is his long philosophical musing on the nature of his true enemy.The only good thing about ""Revolver"" is Mark Strong, who plays a nervous bespectacled hitman. His scenes brighten up the muddled narrative with his superb acting and one shoot-out sequence involving his character shows Guy Ritchie has not lost his touch entirely.",2,Goes On and On,1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,1370,"['Quite', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'wanted', 'do', 'Revolver', 'tagline', 'according', 'IMDb', 'mind', 'will', 'not', 'accept', 'game', 'big', 'OK', 'what', 'kind', 'game', 'film', 'really', 'want', 'play', 'Anyway', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'anti-hero', 'skilled', 'gambler', 'Jake', 'Green', 'doing', 'seven', 'years', 'jail', 'Jake', 'casino', 'owner', 'Macha', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'front', 'men', 'way', 'back', 'attacked', 'assassins', 'sent', 'Macha', 'Luckily', 'Jake', 'saved', 'Zach', 'Vincent', 'Pastore', 'Avi', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Benjamin', 'mysterious', 'guys', 'demand', 'something', 'extraordinary', 'Jake', 'money', 'it.I', 'could', 'follow', 'terribly', 'complicated', 'story', 'so', 'far', '30', 'minuets', 'started', 'think', 'Who', 'story', 'never', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'way', 'repeated', 'quotations', 'Machiavelli', 'Caesar', 'Etiquette', 'Bankers', 'Fundamentals', 'Chess', 'have', 'do', 'convoluted', 'story', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'go', 'Jakes', 'frequent', 'voiceovers', 'are', 'just', 'annoying', 'so', 'long', 'philosophical', 'musing', 'nature', 'true', 'enemy.The', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'Revolver', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'who', 'nervous', 'bespectacled', 'hitman', 'scenes', 'brighten', 'up', 'muddled', 'narrative', 'superb', 'acting', 'one', 'shoot-out', 'sequence', 'involving', 'character', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'not', 'lost', 'touch', 'entirely']",Revolver (2005) (Region 2)
1033197,A357H3W52835OK,B000KDZTIK,Vampyre Mike,"[2, 2]","I was a big fan of Snatch, Lock Stock and the like. If you go into this thinking your getting an action film or some kind of Guy Ritchie norm then you will most likely walk away confused and/or disappointed. The story is more of a psychological thought provoking...thriller I guess I'd say?The main story is about Jake Green/Statham, his release from jail and his involvement with a couple of con artists that he works his way in with in a very interesting tale. The visuals are cool and dramatic in Guy ritchie fashion, there is some shooting and action but it's more so a talking type film. Ray Liotta in my opinion has a great performance and the whole cast was perfect for this film.Supposedly Ritchie wrote most of the story having a ton of Kabbalah references built into it, me not being a follower of the Kabbalah still loved this film. I love trying to figure out why things were how they were and what was going on. You eventually can piece everything together and argue amongst friends for your own conclusions. I will say I have one gripe however, the UK release had a few different parts and a much different ending. Supposedly the US release was dumbed down because people were angry about the movie in the UK and they felt cutting the movie up would make it more accessible. I disagree. The original UK cut was amazing, this one is good but not as good due to the ending being changed primarily.I would love to buy this on Blu-Ray and upgrade it from my DVD, but will not be doing so until a UK cut gets released here in the states.Grade Rating: A+ (If you like psychological films with hidden meanings) Otherwise, don't bother...*Updated 3/3/11* - I did break down and buy this on Blu Ray due to my love for this movie, sadly I was right and it is still the U.S. cut of the film. It looks and sounds gorgeous however if you are a fan of the film. Now just to get the UK cut released in the states ;)*Updated 2/2/12* - After finding out the German version was region free and uncut I decided to re-order it on Ebay. As soon as it arrives and I watch it I will update this section. It's about double what the U.S. release is price wise, but in my opinion the edits on the U.S. version kind of mess up the film a bit.*Updates 8/29/12* - The German Blu-Ray is amazing! However it has two downfalls, the scenes with Lord John (who only speaks Chinese through out the film) all come up with German subtitles. And the little scenes between the movie with the quotes are also in German.So that takes a bit away from the story, but is still a better version than the U.S. edition. I really hope to get a stateside release of the Director's Cut eventually, as it is the definitive version.  =)",5,One of my favorite films!,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,2698,"['was', 'big', 'fan', 'Snatch', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'like', 'go', 'thinking', 'getting', 'action', 'film', 'kind', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'norm', 'then', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'walk', 'away', 'confused', 'and/or', 'disappointed', 'story', 'more', 'psychological', 'thought', 'provoking', 'thriller', 'guess', ""'d"", 'say', 'main', 'story', 'Jake', 'Green/Statham', 'release', 'jail', 'involvement', 'couple', 'con', 'artists', 'way', 'very', 'interesting', 'tale', 'visuals', 'are', 'cool', 'dramatic', 'Guy', 'ritchie', 'fashion', 'shooting', 'action', 'more', 'so', 'talking', 'type', 'film', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'opinion', 'great', 'performance', 'whole', 'cast', 'was', 'perfect', 'film.Supposedly', 'Ritchie', 'wrote', 'most', 'story', 'having', 'ton', 'Kabbalah', 'references', 'built', 'not', 'being', 'follower', 'Kabbalah', 'still', 'loved', 'film', 'love', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'things', 'were', 'how', 'were', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'eventually', 'can', 'piece', 'everything', 'together', 'argue', 'amongst', 'friends', 'own', 'conclusions', 'will', 'say', 'have', 'one', 'gripe', 'however', 'UK', 'release', 'had', 'few', 'different', 'parts', 'much', 'different', 'ending', 'Supposedly', 'US', 'release', 'was', 'dumbed', 'down', 'people', 'were', 'angry', 'movie', 'UK', 'felt', 'cutting', 'movie', 'up', 'would', 'make', 'more', 'accessible', 'disagree', 'original', 'UK', 'cut', 'was', 'amazing', 'one', 'good', 'not', 'good', 'due', 'ending', 'being', 'changed', 'primarily.I', 'would', 'love', 'buy', 'Blu-Ray', 'upgrade', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'doing', 'so', 'UK', 'cut', 'released', 'here', 'states.Grade', 'Rating', 'A+', 'like', 'psychological', 'films', 'hidden', 'meanings', 'Otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', '*Updated', '3/3/11*', 'did', 'break', 'down', 'buy', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'due', 'love', 'movie', 'sadly', 'was', 'right', 'still', 'U.S.', 'cut', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'however', 'are', 'fan', 'film', 'Now', 'just', 'get', 'UK', 'cut', 'released', 'states', '*Updated', '2/2/12*', 'finding', 'out', 'German', 'version', 'was', 'region', 'free', 'uncut', 'decided', 're-order', 'Ebay', 'As', 'soon', 'watch', 'will', 'update', 'section', 'about', 'double', 'what', 'U.S.', 'release', 'price', 'wise', 'opinion', 'edits', 'U.S.', 'version', 'kind', 'mess', 'film', 'bit', '8/29/12*', 'German', 'Blu-Ray', 'amazing', 'However', 'two', 'downfalls', 'scenes', 'Lord', 'John', 'who', 'only', 'Chinese', 'film', 'come', 'up', 'German', 'subtitles', 'little', 'scenes', 'movie', 'quotes', 'are', 'also', 'German.So', 'bit', 'away', 'story', 'still', 'better', 'version', 'U.S.', 'edition', 'really', 'hope', 'get', 'stateside', 'release', 'Director', 'Cut', 'eventually', 'definitive', 'version', '=']",Revolver (2005) (Region 2)

For this  reviewer, who is neither into mysticism nor into philosophy, this was pretentious, badly structured and boring. I kept on thinking there was going to be a big punchline and revelation, beyond what was gradually becoming apparent.  I thought it was aiming for a dramatic movie finale like 'Angel Heart', 'Fight Club' or 'Usual Suspects' but it ended with a underwhelming philosophical dud instead that left me scratching my head.You know Usual Suspect's tagline - 'The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did not exist'?  Well, it's said twice, makes a whole lotta sense and defines the whole movie.The equivalent pearls of ""wisdom"" in Revolver?  And the obligatory flashbacks?  Repeated about 10 times each just so you couldn't possibly miss their portentous significance.  Despite good acting and visuals, as the movie progressed  I was not just bored, but actively annoyed by all the repetition and meandering plot.Reading about it afterwards on Wikipedia, it seems whole scenes have been edited out, so maybe the original version was better.  The psych talking heads at the end did not make it any better either.  Bad sign, in fact - the ending doesn't stand on its own so it needs explaining.  Kinda like ""Don't you get it?  It's because..."" at the end of a joke.Hey, can you tell, Mr. Viewer, how deep and meaningful this movie is?  No?  Well, then maybe you're just too dumb to appreciate this masterpiece.
