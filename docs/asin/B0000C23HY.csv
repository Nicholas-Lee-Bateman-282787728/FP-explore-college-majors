772346,AO80JEDFYS6MJ,B0000C23HY,A. Reader,"[0, 0]","This is a filmed version of the London stage production of ""Oklahoma.""  Overall, it's very well done.  Having only seen this live when I was young and being most familiar with the movie, I really enjoyed seeing the staging and the live production.  Hugh Jackman does an excellent job of bringing Curly to life without mimicking Gordon MacRae, and Shuler Hensley brings a complexity to Jud Fry that the McRae/Jones musical completely lacks.  Another bonus in this version, the two main characters do their own dancing in the dream ballet sequence, which really makes it all fit better.Why I didn't give it 5 stars:1.  For whatever reason, the film includes shots of an audience, when this was not filmed in front of an audience, and the change is abrupt and jarring.  The film even looks different.  It's strange, breaks up the flow of the film, and just seems silly.  They weren't there, leave it at that.2.  When we meet Laurie--the girl who sparks such deep passion in two men that they are willing to give up everything for her--she's in denim overalls and even though there's supposed to be this attraction/sparring thing between Laurie and Curly, it's almost impossible to see her attraction to Curly, and it's a bit hard to understand his attraction to her.  Curly is obviously smitten beneath his teasing--Laurie just comes across as mean and distant.  Later, when she sings about not crying over a man, she seems hardly bothered by Curly being with another girl.  So it's really hard in the later part to believe in her when she's crying in Curly's arms.  She's just too independent and too distant to be a believable fragile, scared person later.  The actress playing Laurie has a wonderful voice, and obviously is a wonderful dancer.  It's just a portrayal of Laurie that didn't seem believable, nor does she come across as a character anyone would be in love with.  I didn't even find her character likable.But, still fun to see and I'd still recommend it to anyone who loves the old musicals.",4,"Overall, a great production",1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,2004,"['filmed', 'version', 'London', 'stage', 'production', 'Oklahoma', 'Overall', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Having', 'only', 'seen', 'live', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'being', 'most', 'familiar', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'staging', 'live', 'production', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'Curly', 'life', 'mimicking', 'Gordon', 'MacRae', 'Shuler', 'Hensley', 'complexity', 'Jud', 'Fry', 'McRae/Jones', 'musical', 'completely', 'bonus', 'version', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'do', 'own', 'dancing', 'dream', 'ballet', 'sequence', 'really', 'fit', 'better.Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', '5', 'stars:1', 'reason', 'film', 'shots', 'audience', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'filmed', 'front', 'audience', 'change', 'abrupt', 'jarring', 'film', 'even', 'different', 'strange', 'up', 'flow', 'film', 'just', 'silly', 'were', ""n't"", 'there', 'leave', 'that.2', 'When', 'meet', 'Laurie', 'girl', 'who', 'such', 'deep', 'passion', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'everything', 'denim', 'overalls', 'even', 'supposed', 'be', 'attraction/sparring', 'thing', 'Laurie', 'Curly', 'almost', 'impossible', 'see', 'attraction', 'Curly', 'bit', 'hard', 'understand', 'attraction', 'Curly', 'obviously', 'smitten', 'teasing', 'Laurie', 'just', 'across', 'mean', 'distant', 'Later', 'when', 'not', 'crying', 'man', 'hardly', 'bothered', 'Curly', 'being', 'girl', 'really', 'hard', 'later', 'part', 'believe', 'when', 'crying', 'Curly', 'arms', 'just', 'too', 'independent', 'too', 'distant', 'be', 'believable', 'fragile', 'scared', 'person', 'later', 'actress', 'playing', 'Laurie', 'wonderful', 'voice', 'obviously', 'wonderful', 'dancer', 'just', 'portrayal', 'Laurie', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'believable', 'come', 'character', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'find', 'character', 'likable.But', 'still', 'see', ""'d"", 'still', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'old', 'musicals']",N/A

Gradually, however, it became clear that virtually every bit player, dancer,singer on stage is performing brilliantly. I kept thinking about how Placido Domingo lights up the stage with a voice that causes the stage boards to vibrate-with every chorus member so inspired, they are all just start ""living the parts""! Hugh Jackman, of ""Nicole Kidman-Australia"" movie fame, electrifies the entire ensemble. Here is a seriously underated actor in Hugh, nay, singer, and dancer!...They are all supreme naturals. I could go on with detailed descriptions of each character-such as the Italian peddler, whose performance rivals  Simone Alaimo as Dr. Dulcamara in ""l'Elisir d'Amore "" . Or Hugh playing ""Curly"" who sings a delightful tune to Judd about how delightful it would be if he just went ahead and""offed his-self""..and you might think, well, that's not a very nice thing to sing to the poor old sweaty , filthy,trigger happy, knife happy, arson happy, dangerously crazed muscle head...until you get a load of his chilling performance, and you'll be thinking, ""Oh yeah...the sooner we arrange this suicide the better"".Enjoying the perfection of the performances allowed me to really appreciate the array of melodis and tempo changes. It saddens me to think that it seems no one can create a timeless libretto, choc a bloc with memorable music today.I found myself laughing til I cried at the ""girl fight"". This performance is full of these sparkling vingettes.A production that comes very close, might be ""Death Takes a Holiday"", also available on Amazon, but only in CD soundtrack form. That one too should be staged and filmed by the same people dripping with talent that staged this 'old thing'.You will be proud to have this 'early Hugh Jackman' in your collection.

A superlative production with something of a revisionist slant that actually works since the director, Trevor Nunn, actually went back to the original 1940 production and the source material. There are also some really knock-out performances here. Shuler Hensley plays Jud with real pathos and menace. Josefina Gabrielle is an earthy Laurie who perfectly captures her dilemma. It's the first time I really understood and felt Laurie's conflict. Maureen Lipman is simply perfect as Aunt Eller. Most notable, however, is Hugh Jackman as Curly. You can see why this performance put him on the map, so to speak. He's the perfect Curly and brings just the right blend of charm, swagger, and yearning to the part.

And it's a classic. It won tons of awards in Britain, and on Broadway when the production came here in the 90's. Hugh Jackman did this production right before breaking into the cinematic world as Wolverine in ""X Men,"" and a more ideal Curly you couldn't find if you tried. This is a video of a stage production, and it has all the excitement of being in the audience instead of just watching a movie. ""Oklahoma!"" is of course an American classic, the first musical Rodgers and Hammerstein created together. But this production brings back to us why the original was so powerful, premiering in the middle of World War II.What's particularly great about this production is that in Laurey's Dream Ballet, because both Curly and Laurey are triple threats, they dance the ballet themselves instead of having dancer stand-ins. There isn't a weak link in this chain, every performer here is top rate...and as down-home as they come! It was choreographed by Susan Stroman before she became the Belle of Broadway, and all the dancing is top-rate. As I said, you'll never believe it was done by the Royal National Theatre of Great Britain, in the Olivier Theatre. Don't hesitate to get your hands on this DVD, it's a winner, and makes us proud that American musical theatre has become a true art form.

772353,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0000C23HY,C. O. DeRiemer,"[7, 8]","This is a filming of the Trevor Nunn version of the musical that first opened in London and then came over to Broadway. For many who may recall Oklahoma! only through the movie with Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones, this should be a welcome new look. This version is energetic with the cowboys looking scruffy and with the characters much more clearly defined. Curly and Laurie are played by actors who do their own dancing as well as singing. Curly is played by Hugh Jackman as a strutting, confident young man. Jackman brings a lot of skill to the part as actor, singer and dancer. More importantly, he brings a lot of charisma and likeability. Josefina Gabrielle plays Laurie as a tomboy, but shy and thoughtful...and probably smarter than Curly. And Shuler Hensley as Jud Fry dominates his scenes. His Jud is surly and mean, but also torn by loneliness, a guy who is almost inarticulate with resentment. His ""Lonely Room"" becomes a powerful song. Jimmy Johnston plays Will Parker with great energy and, as with Jackman, great likeability.Oklahoma! stands the test of time for a couple of reasons, I think. The story line is extremely simple, but it's the simplicity that makes the characters so attractive. Except for Jud Fry, there's no angst or psychological spinning. The toughest question is, will Curly get to take Laurie to the dance? The second reason is Rodgers and Hammerstein's terrific score. If there's a weak song in the show I didn't notice it. I particularly like ""The Surrey With the Fringe on Top"" and ""Out of my Dreams."" Surrey is a gem of a wooing song...sweet, a little funny but then very touching. The music is memorable yet easy to recall, and Hammerstein's lyric, in my view, is a classic example of the use of concrete imagery to evoke feelings. ""Out of My Dreams,"" to me, is simply one of the best waltzes written, and one that captures perfectly Laurie's longings.This is a filmed recording of the stage show, but through careful editing never seems especially static. There's an extra about how the show was put together which is interesting.

To start with, it was produced with the participation and approval of the original composers families. The stage design was fairly simple visually, letting the actors and music tell the story without interference, but clearly placing the setting in turn of the (20th) century Midwest.Then, There's that cast. Pure O.D. talent. This is the first time that the singer hero, heroine, and villain were the same actors as the dancer hero, heroine, and villain in the ballet scene of any Oscar and hammerstein musical. The character parts were each and every one outstanding,too. There was not a single moment during the show when you could realize that the actors were all british. The illusion of being in Oklahoma was perfect. Particular credit is due to Hugh Jackman. He played Curly as a true western character down to the least mannerism while singing up a storm.

772364,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0000C23HY,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","OKLAHOMA! opened on Broadway in 1943 and became a classic - not only because the Rodgers and Hammerstein score was so strong, but also because Agnes De Mille was brought in to introduce serious choreography to the Broadway stage. For the past 64 years this musical comedy/drama has been on the boards both professionally and in high schools, colleges and community theaters and always meets with audience acclaim.  In 1999 Trevor Nunn reshaped the work, added choreography by Susan Stroman, beefed up the orchestrations, and re-staged the old warhorse in London and the result is an entirely fresh look and appreciation for an 'American classic'.Nunn opens the inner conflicts of the story and emphasizes some of the more minor characters, a move that adds to the dramatic flow of the work.  Yet his biggest asset is the presence of Hugh Jackman as Curly, a handsome stage presence who also happens to possess a strong baritone singing voice and is an agile dancer.  From the opening bars of 'Oh, what a beautiful morning' he has us in his back pocket.  The remainder of the cast is strong, with special kudos to Maureen Lipman as Aunt Eller, a woman of such plainsman power that she holds the story together with ease.  Josefina Gabrielle as Laurey is a fine dancer and has a supple if monochromatic voice and brings a different kind of life to her role. And for once the sinister Jud Fry becomes an understandable villain in the fine work by Shuler Hensley.For those who don't like audible applause from an audience during a show the technique of making the film appear like a live production will disturb. For this viewer seeing the British audience become involved in the response of this musical made it that much more fun.  This is a very fine performance and film of an old American treasure.

772369,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000C23HY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[61, 65]","Every time I watch a version of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; there are two conclusions that I always reach.  The first is that there is no greater chorus in the American musical than the title song from this show.  No wonder as soon as it is finished the cast does it again and then for good measure does it at the end of the curtain calls.  It always gives me chills when they do the big finish and it occurs to me that the song &quot;Oklahoma&quot; is our secular equivalent of &quot;The Hallelujah Chorus.&quot;  The second inevitable thought is that Shirley Jones had a truly great singing voice, perfect for musical theater.  Any one who plays Laurey Williams is going to suffer in comparison when it comes to the singing (the test case remains the same: the end of the reprise of &quot;People Will Say We're in Love.&quot;That is not to say that this 1999 London Stage Revival of the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical is not impressive.  Director Trevor Nunn restores the full text and you can see why Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II were both interested in turning Lynn Riggs' play &quot;Green Grow the Lilacs&quot; into a musical.  It might seem strange to say so, but one of the strengths of this production is that the acting is so solid.  The comic relief characters like Will Parker (Jimmy Johnston), Ado Annie (Vicki Simon), and Ali Hakim (Peter Polycarpou), are given more gravity without sacrificing the humor.  Of course, part of this is because the show was not really filmed before a live audience, even though there are applause and shots of the audience from the stage at the end of most of the musical numbers.  So never is heard a laugh from the audience during the proceedings, which necessarily gives more weight to the characters and the action.Hugh Jackman is the main attraction as Curly McLain, mostly because fans have problems believing this is the guy who plays Wolverine in the &quot;X-Men&quot; movies, although having just won  the 2004 Theater Wings Best Actor in a Musical Tony Award for portraying singer Peter Allen in the Broadway version of &quot;The Boy From Oz&quot; should establish his bona fides in this regard.  Josefina Gabrielle plays Laurey Williams as more of a tomboy, and if her singing is solid but unspectacular, her acting and dancing bring some new dimensions to the character as well.  The dream ballet has the novelty of being the first major production in which Curly and Laurey do their own dancing.  There are those who do not care for the sequence on principle, but having it here as the end of the first act makes for effective foreshadowing.It is hard to think there could ever be a bad Aunt Eller, and Maureen Lipman shows how well the role can work when it is underplayed.  But I think the standout performer here has to be Shuler Hensley as Jud Fry (Hensley played the Frankenstein Monster to Jackman's vampire hunter in &quot;Van Helsing&quot; this summer).  The character is the villain and he never seems to quite work in most of the version of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; I have seen.  But Hensley brings a subtlety to the role that really makes it work.  You get a sense of how he is dangerous without him being overtly threatening; in other words, you can understand why Laurie would consider him, even if only for a moment.  Having such a strong performer in that role really elevates the show.&quot;Oklahoma!&quot; holds up really well, provided you are open to what we would not consider to be an old-fashioned musical (anything by Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein and/or before Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Webber), and Nunn deserves a lot of the credit for crafting this production.  The only serious complaint with the DVD is that all we have on the Bonus Disc is a 24-minute featurette on the production.  While that has its moments (the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein people are actually puzzled as to why Nunn wants to do the show, as if the British have no understanding or respect for the classics) it is hard to believe they could not fit it on the other disc.  In comparison, the &quot;Mystic River: Bonus Disc&quot; has 189 minutes of material.",5,The classic American musical gets the Trevor Nunn touch,1086912000,"06 11, 2004",2004,4126,"['time', 'watch', 'version', 'quot', 'Oklahoma', 'quot', 'are', 'two', 'conclusions', 'always', 'reach', 'first', 'greater', 'chorus', 'American', 'musical', 'title', 'song', 'show', 'wonder', 'as', 'soon', 'finished', 'cast', 'again', 'then', 'good', 'measure', 'end', 'curtain', 'always', 'chills', 'when', 'do', 'big', 'finish', 'song', 'quot', 'Oklahoma', 'quot', 'secular', 'equivalent', 'quot', 'Hallelujah', 'Chorus.', 'quot', 'second', 'inevitable', 'thought', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'had', 'truly', 'great', 'singing', 'voice', 'perfect', 'musical', 'theater', 'one', 'who', 'Laurey', 'Williams', 'going', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'when', 'singing', 'test', 'case', 'same', 'end', 'reprise', 'quot', 'People', 'Will', 'Say', ""'re"", 'Love.', 'quot', 'not', 'say', '1999', 'London', 'Stage', 'Revival', 'classic', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'musical', 'not', 'impressive', 'Director', 'Trevor', 'Nunn', 'full', 'text', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'Oscar', 'Hammerstein', 'II', 'were', 'interested', 'turning', 'Lynn', 'Riggs', 'play', 'quot', 'Green', 'Grow', 'Lilacs', 'quot', 'musical', 'might', 'seem', 'strange', 'say', 'so', 'one', 'strengths', 'production', 'acting', 'so', 'solid', 'comic', 'relief', 'characters', 'Will', 'Parker', 'Jimmy', 'Johnston', 'Ado', 'Annie', 'Vicki', 'Simon', 'Ali', 'Hakim', 'Peter', 'Polycarpou', 'are', 'given', 'more', 'gravity', 'sacrificing', 'humor', 'course', 'part', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'filmed', 'live', 'audience', 'even', 'are', 'applause', 'shots', 'audience', 'stage', 'end', 'most', 'musical', 'numbers', 'So', 'never', 'heard', 'laugh', 'audience', 'proceedings', 'necessarily', 'more', 'weight', 'characters', 'action.Hugh', 'Jackman', 'main', 'attraction', 'Curly', 'McLain', 'mostly', 'fans', 'have', 'problems', 'believing', 'guy', 'who', 'Wolverine', 'quot', 'X-Men', 'quot', 'movies', 'having', 'just', 'won', '2004', 'Theater', 'Wings', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Musical', 'Tony', 'Award', 'portraying', 'singer', 'Peter', 'Allen', 'Broadway', 'version', 'quot', 'Boy', 'From', 'Oz', 'quot', 'should', 'establish', 'bona', 'fides', 'regard', 'Josefina', 'Gabrielle', 'Laurey', 'Williams', 'more', 'tomboy', 'singing', 'solid', 'unspectacular', 'acting', 'dancing', 'bring', 'new', 'dimensions', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'dream', 'ballet', 'novelty', 'being', 'first', 'major', 'production', 'Curly', 'Laurey', 'do', 'own', 'dancing', 'are', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'sequence', 'principle', 'having', 'here', 'end', 'first', 'act', 'effective', 'foreshadowing.It', 'hard', 'think', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'bad', 'Aunt', 'Eller', 'Maureen', 'Lipman', 'how', 'well', 'role', 'can', 'work', 'when', 'underplayed', 'think', 'standout', 'performer', 'here', 'be', 'Shuler', 'Hensley', 'Jud', 'Fry', 'Hensley', 'played', 'Frankenstein', 'Monster', 'Jackman', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'quot', 'Van', 'Helsing', 'quot', 'summer', 'character', 'villain', 'never', 'quite', 'work', 'most', 'version', 'quot', 'Oklahoma', 'quot', 'have', 'seen', 'Hensley', 'subtlety', 'role', 'really', 'work', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'dangerous', 'being', 'overtly', 'threatening', 'other', 'words', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'Laurie', 'would', 'consider', 'even', 'only', 'moment', 'Having', 'such', 'strong', 'performer', 'role', 'really', 'show.', 'quot', 'Oklahoma', 'quot', 'up', 'really', 'well', 'provided', 'are', 'open', 'what', 'would', 'not', 'consider', 'be', 'old-fashioned', 'musical', 'anything', 'Rodgers', 'amp', 'Hammerstein', 'Stephen', 'Sondheim', 'Andrew', 'Lloyd', 'Webber', 'Nunn', 'lot', 'credit', 'crafting', 'production', 'only', 'serious', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'have', 'Bonus', 'Disc', '24-minute', 'featurette', 'production', 'moments', 'Rodgers', 'amp', 'Hammerstein', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'puzzled', 'why', 'Nunn', 'do', 'show', 'British', 'have', 'understanding', 'respect', 'classics', 'hard', 'believe', 'could', 'not', 'fit', 'other', 'disc', 'comparison', 'quot', 'Mystic', 'River', 'Bonus', 'Disc', 'quot', '189', 'minutes', 'material']",N/A

Moore,"[137, 140]","The 1999 London production of ""Oklahoma!"", directed by Trevor Nunn with choreography by Susan Stroman, was the first major departure ever from the original Joshua Logan-Agnes De Mille production of 1943. It was a gamble that paid off big, for the performance recorded for posterity on this DVD is absolutely brilliant--funny, riveting, and deeply poignant. The dancing is astonishing, and the beloved Rodgers & Hammerstein songs have never sounded so good. Nunn and Stroman know how to stage each number for maximum dramatic effect, so that the songs come across less as songs than as dramatic monologues in music--which is, of course, exactly what Rodgers & Hammerstein wanted.The cast of this version is so wonderful that it is impossible to talk about them in anything but superlatives. (I might make a slight, regretful exception for Vicki Simon as Ado Annie, who is merely very good whereas everyone else is spectacular.) As Will Parker, Jimmy Johnston--an endearing if improbable cross between Will Rogers, Russ Tamblyn and Jack Black--barrels through his big number, ""Kansas City,"" with infectious glee and astounding athleticism, including a dandy exhibition of trick roping. Some reviewers have pointed out that Peter Polycarpou's accent as Ali Hakim is shaky, but there's no quibbling with his singing or his comic timing; in appearance and talent, he reminds me more than a little of Tony Shalhoub. Maureen Lipman is a perfect Aunt Eller, tough as an old birch tree, plain-spoken and drily witty as she dispenses tough love to the residents of Claremore, Okla. Josefina Gabrielle is an earthier Laurey than we're used to, but she's a good singer and an exquisite dancer, and she makes Laurey's confused longings as painful as a punch in the gut.The real acting honors, however, must be divided between the romantic rivals--Hugh Jackman as Curly and Shuler Hensley as Jud. This production launched Jackman's international career, and no wonder--from the first few bars of ""Oh, What a Beautiful Morning,"" you can't take your eyes off him. He is visually perfect as Curly, he dances well and sings beautifully, and--above all--he exudes charisma from every pore. Hensley combines a rich, operatic baritone with a brooding, menacing stage presence; he makes Jud a classic monster, evoking both pity and terror. His solo number, detailing both his pitiful loneliness and his doomed love for Laurey, is one of the most riveting pieces of dramatic singing I've ever seen or heard.",5,A riveting reconsideration of a musical classic.,1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,2484,"['1999', 'London', 'production', 'Oklahoma', 'directed', 'Trevor', 'Nunn', 'choreography', 'Susan', 'Stroman', 'was', 'first', 'major', 'departure', 'ever', 'original', 'Joshua', 'Logan-Agnes', 'De', 'Mille', 'production', '1943', 'was', 'gamble', 'paid', 'off', 'big', 'performance', 'recorded', 'posterity', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'funny', 'riveting', 'deeply', 'poignant', 'dancing', 'astonishing', 'beloved', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'songs', 'have', 'never', 'sounded', 'so', 'good', 'Nunn', 'Stroman', 'know', 'how', 'stage', 'number', 'maximum', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'songs', 'come', 'across', 'songs', 'dramatic', 'monologues', 'music', 'course', 'exactly', 'what', 'Rodgers', 'Hammerstein', 'wanted.The', 'cast', 'version', 'so', 'wonderful', 'impossible', 'talk', 'anything', 'superlatives', 'might', 'make', 'slight', 'regretful', 'exception', 'Vicki', 'Simon', 'Ado', 'Annie', 'who', 'merely', 'very', 'good', 'whereas', 'everyone', 'else', 'spectacular', 'Will', 'Parker', 'Jimmy', 'Johnston', 'endearing', 'improbable', 'cross', 'Will', 'Rogers', 'Russ', 'Tamblyn', 'Jack', 'Black', 'barrels', 'big', 'number', 'Kansas', 'City', 'infectious', 'glee', 'astounding', 'athleticism', 'including', 'dandy', 'exhibition', 'trick', 'roping', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'Peter', 'Polycarpou', 'accent', 'Ali', 'Hakim', 'shaky', 'quibbling', 'singing', 'comic', 'timing', 'appearance', 'talent', 'more', 'little', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'Maureen', 'Lipman', 'perfect', 'Aunt', 'Eller', 'tough', 'old', 'birch', 'tree', 'plain-spoken', 'drily', 'witty', 'tough', 'love', 'residents', 'Claremore', 'Okla.', 'Josefina', 'Gabrielle', 'earthier', 'Laurey', ""'re"", 'used', 'good', 'singer', 'exquisite', 'dancer', 'Laurey', 'confused', 'longings', 'as', 'painful', 'punch', 'gut.The', 'real', 'acting', 'honors', 'however', 'must', 'be', 'divided', 'romantic', 'rivals', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Curly', 'Shuler', 'Hensley', 'Jud', 'production', 'launched', 'Jackman', 'international', 'career', 'wonder', 'first', 'few', 'bars', 'Oh', 'What', 'Beautiful', 'Morning', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'visually', 'perfect', 'Curly', 'well', 'sings', 'beautifully', 'charisma', 'pore', 'Hensley', 'rich', 'operatic', 'baritone', 'brooding', 'menacing', 'stage', 'presence', 'classic', 'monster', 'evoking', 'pity', 'terror', 'solo', 'number', 'detailing', 'pitiful', 'loneliness', 'doomed', 'love', 'Laurey', 'one', 'most', 'riveting', 'pieces', 'dramatic', 'singing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'heard']",N/A

772379,A31QEAZMJWBF28,B0000C23HY,NMdesapio,"[5, 6]","Of special interest in this acclaimed British production of OKLAHOMA! is the Dream Ballet that ends Act I.  Conceived and staged in the original 1943 production by Agnes de Mille, the ballet attempts to show the subconscious wishes and anxieties of the heroine, Laurey:  her love for the upright Curly and her fear of, yet strange attraction to, his enemy, the disgusting Jud Fry.  In the British version, choreographer Susan Stroman gives us a definite taste of de Mille's original (which can also be seen in the 1955 film version of OKLAHOMA!), while giving it added sexual tension; there is no question, here, what Laurey fears from Jud.  As for the rest of the show, director Trevor Nunn lives up to his reputation of getting at characters' motivations; each actor gives a credible, multi-dimensional portrayal, and even the ensemble members have specific ""characters"" to play.The roles of Curly, Laurey, and Jud are played by ""triple threat"" actors (they even do their own dancing in the ballet) Hugh Jackman, Josefina Gabrielle, and Schuler Grant.  Although my favorite Curly will always be Gordon Mac Rae (in the 1955 movie), I must admit that Jackman is visually ideal and vocally almost that - his real accent is sometimes audible when he sings, and his voice does not have quite the openness of Mac Rae's - as Curly.  Gabrielle is likewise visually perfect and an excellent dancer, even though her soprano, though more than adequate, is not especially glamorous.But it is Grant and the rest of the supporting cast who steal the show.  Grant's Tony Award-winning Jud is dangerous, disturbed (what an eerie smokehouse scene with Curly!), yet oddly sympathetic:  one feels truly sorry when Laurey repulses him, and when he is killed.  As the secondary ""comic couple,"" Will and Ado Annie, Jimmy Johnston and Vicki Simon have the best voices in the cast and make a special treat of their Act II duet, ""All Er Nothin'.""  Finally, Maureen Lipman (Aunt Eller), Peter Polycarpou (Ali Hakim), and the actor who plays Mr. Carnes all offer outstanding character portrayals.

772386,A2MJKH6DQIKTM3,B0000C23HY,Robert Amsel,"[5, 7]","I've seen several stage productions of &quot;Oklahoma,&quot; as well as the MacRae-Jones movie version.  But Trevor Nunn breathes real life into what some may have dismissed as an old chestnut. The result is a full-blooded, gritty, dramatic, and thoroughly involving production, beautifully acted, sung, and danced.  The nuances within the lyrics come alive as well, so that we believe we're hearing these 60+-year-old standards for the first time.Up until now, we've only had the 1955 movie version to assess the show, and the movie was very much a product of its conservative era --  overly sentimental and overly censored. Shirley Jones's Laurey of the 1950s, in gingham dresses, was sweet, overly feminine, and coy, unlike Josefina Gabrielle's tom-boyish, hardworking, farm laboring, feisty, salt-of-the-earth Laurey who, dressed in a flannel shirt and overalls throughout most of the first act, looks and acts like she has some genuine connection to the soil.Gordon MacRae as the 1955 Curley, was a wonderful baritone, with a pre-requisite masculine presence, but he lacked Hugh Jackman's dramatic abilities and subtletly of performance.Although Rod Steiger was an exceptional movie Jud, he was at the disadvantage of having so much of his material condensed and/or censored that he came across mainly as a movie &quot;heavy,&quot; whereas in this current production, Shuler Hensley is given all the artillery of the original stage script to play with, including a previously cut song, and thus his Jud emerges as a terrifying and yet sympathetic villain.Granted, probably no one living or dead can compare to Charlotte Greenwood's Aunt Eller in the original movie, but Maureen Lipman still manages to make this part her own, quite sympathetically, not only as Laurey's guardian but as the community's matriarchal figure.Susan Stroman's new choreography is absolutely splendid, and probably for the first time ever, the ballet sequence actually works, since the performers can sing, act, and dance, and don't require doubles to do the footwork.Also noteworthy are Jimmy Jonston as Will Parker and Vicki Simon as Ado Annie (even though Gloria Grahame will always be my ideal of that character, even with the sometimes bowdlerized lyrics Gloria had to sing in 1955.)As some have pointed out here, the &quot;Persian&quot; peddler, Ali Hakim, played by Peter Polycarpou, sounds more New York by way of Eastern Europe than Persia, but perhaps this was intentional since he is somewhat of a flimflam man (and, you may recall, Eddie Albert hardly looked or sounded Persian in the movie version either).This Trevor Nunn production also reminds us that we are not watching just another frothy musical comedy of yesteryear, devoid of any relevance to today.  The show examines hatred and bigotry (between rancher and cowman).  The show includes psychotic stalking (Jud's obsessive behavior toward Laurie).  The show presents us with attempted murder (Jud's two attempts to kill Curley).  The show even includes drug usage (Laurey's snorting of Ali Hakim's elixer that sends her off into an acid-like ballet trip).  Now how modern or relevant can you get?As a major cohesive theme, Trevor Nunn stresses the animosity existing between the farmers and the cowboys.  Thus, when Curley proposes to Laurey, he also decides to give up his free, roaming life as a cowboy and settle down to farm.  This scene is not only poignant, but a powerful symbol of encroaching civilization, since this newly settled territory is about to become a state in an Old West that is quickly vanishing.  The conflict between farmer and cowboy also highlights the opposition of Ado Annie's father, a farmer, to Ado Annie's marrying Will Parker, a cowboy.  This conflict further plays out between Laurey's suitors, the cowboy Curley and the farmer Jud.  Thus, the song, &quot;The Farmer and the Cowman Should Be Friends&quot; is far more integral to the whole story than just a rousing second-act opening.The only thing somewhat curious about the production, and this is a minor quibble, was the choice to periodically show several scenes shot from the stage into a live audience at the National so that we can gauge audience reaction and applause to certain key scenes.  Yet, except for these scattered scenes, the production was mostly shot without any live audience present. Thus, an unnatural blending occurs, in which there is no audience reaction to comic lines when there should be, reminding us that there is no actual audience present.  Perhaps Trevor Nunn simply wished to show us the audience's enthusiasm, when they actually were present, to duplicate the electricity between audience and performers in a live production.  Still, I wonder if this idea should have been reconsidered.",5,The best production of &quot;Oklahoma&quot; I've ever seen.,1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,4761,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'stage',

Well, I was wrong! For starters, the setting is completely different... Instead of cute surroundings, this is a little more rugged, with Laurie Williams and her Aunt Eller living in a more pioneer type of home. Curly, as played by Hugh Jackman is basically the same, but Laurie is somewhat of a tomboy, although still as deeply in love with Curly as in the film version. The nasty hired hand, Jud Fry has a lot more emotional depth, and you get a much better picture as to how he became that way. The choreography is also different than Agnes DeMille's acclaimed version for the original Broadway play and movie, but it's very innovative, fresh and good on it's own. The principal stars also dance in this number, instead of doubles like the Broadway and film version.The opening moment when Jackman started singing, ""Oh What A Beautiful Morning"", I just knew I was going to enjoy this....up to that point, I knew Hugh could sing, but didn't realize just how well!Another plus for this, is that it has a full on symphony orchestra backing up the play and you get to glimpse the audience reaction from time to time. One more plus is how this was filmed....at all different angles as well as some close ups.The score includes the title song, ""The Surrey With The Fringe On Top"", ""People Will Say We're In Love"", ""I Can't Say No"", and many more you'll probably recognize, including two songs that weren't in the film version and that I'd never heard before.I really enjoyed this and I think you will too!",5,Delightful,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,1658,"['was', 'huge', 'very', 'pleasant', 'surprise', ""'d"", 'always', 'loved', 'movie', 'version', 'Oklahoma', 'thought', 'other', 'version', 'would', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'Well', 'was', 'wrong', 'starters', 'setting', 'completely', 'different', 'Instead', 'cute', 'surroundings', 'little', 'more', 'rugged', 'Laurie', 'Williams', 'Aunt', 'Eller', 'living', 'more', 'pioneer', 'type', 'home', 'Curly', 'played', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'basically', 'same', 'Laurie', 'somewhat', 'tomboy', 'still', 'deeply', 'love', 'Curly', 'film', 'version', 'nasty', 'hired', 'hand', 'Jud', 'Fry', 'lot', 'more', 'emotional', 'depth', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'picture', 'how', 'became', 'way', 'choreography', 'also', 'different', 'Agnes', 'DeMille', 'acclaimed', 'version', 'original', 'Broadway', 'play', 'movie', 'very', 'innovative', 'fresh', 'good', 'own', 'principal', 'stars', 'also', 'dance', 'number', 'instead', 'doubles', 'Broadway', 'film', 'version.The', 'opening', 'moment', 'when', 'Jackman', 'started', 'singing', 'Oh', 'What', 'Beautiful', 'Morning', 'just', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'enjoy', '.up', 'point', 'knew', 'Hugh', 'could', 'sing', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'well', 'plus', 'full', 'symphony', 'orchestra', 'backing', 'up', 'play', 'get', 'glimpse', 'audience', 'reaction', 'time', 'time', 'One', 'more', 'plus', 'how', 'was', 'filmed', '.at', 'different', 'angles', 'as', 'well', 'close', 'ups.The', 'score', 'title', 'song', 'Surrey', 'Fringe', 'Top', 'People', 'Will', 'Say', ""'re"", 'Love', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Say', 'No', 'many', 'more', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'recognize', 'including', 'two', 'songs', 'were', ""n't"", 'film', 'version', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'before.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'will', 'too']",N/A

Hugh Jackman is beyond question a great singer and I am offically in love with him now.  What a Curly.  And shirtless for a bit too!  Sigh.  I will say it now.  This is the best STAGE production of Oklahoma, EVER, as far as I can tell.  Since the original stage play premiered almost 50 years before I was born I cannot be sure.  But looking at the original costumes,(not speaking of the Movie costumes which were great, the original plays costumes were borderline comic book, they seem dated although they were great for 1943.I still cannot imagine that the original broadway show could have been done any better.  There was a level of stage craft and knowledge of stage acting in 1943 far superior to today's efforts, simply because back then the stage was about 100 times more important as a mainstream art form than it is today.  Today's audiences are much smaller and therefore there is a smaller well of talent to choose from when presenting musical theater.  Vaudeville also is gone of course.  All these media produced a huge variety of performers in 1943 that knew how to act on a stage.  Those who look at the original or movie version costumes and sets and think ""hokey"" are off the mark.  You simply cannot expect a 21st century aesthetic from a mid 20th century presentation.Hugh Jackman is a revelation as Curly.  His singing voice is powerful and gorgeous and he has the charisma and acting chops for any role.  The fistfight at the end was amazing.  That man clearly knows instinctively how to swing a punch and I wouldn't give Shuler Hensley much of a chance against him in a real fight.  His Curley is also blessed with dialog that more closely resembled the dialog in the play, Green Grow the Lilacs, which was the source for Oklahoma!.  In fact I am reading the play now and it is amazing how closely the dialog and story were adapted in both productions.  Back to Hugh for the moment.  His Curly is masculine and sweet just as he should be.  The same, however, can be said for Gordon MacRae.  I cannot decide which Curly I like better.  Gordon MacRae has the edge for vocals.  His voice is possibly the most beautiful male voice in the history of american musical theater.  But that doesn't minimize the beauty of Hugh's vocals at all.  His voice can stand alongside anyone with no fear.  His voice also has a power that is quite amazing.  Result, tie.I have to say that Josefina Gabrielle is, to me, superior to Shirley Jones, as far as acting.  Her vocals are as good, perhaps better than Shirley to some and not as good to others so I give them a tie.  I do think Shirley sang in a much higher key but when she did sing more softly, as in ""out of my dreams"" her voice was definitely superior to Josefina, but not by a lot.  On the other side of the coin, Josefina is also a trained Ballerina clearly and Shirley was not a dancer.  In fact if you notice, neither Gordon or Shirley do ANY real dancing of any kind, thoughout the film, unlike Hugh and Josefina.  And Josefina is just a better actress.  However on Shirleys side her Laurey is much more the fantasy girl and Gordon's Curly the fantasy male lead.  All of them are great actors but Josefina could clearly play Laurey either way and I am not sure Shirley could.  Result win for Josefina.On the subject of coveralls, I like them a lot and the way she is presented, however, females RARELY wore pants as hard as it may be to believe now.  In that era, if you look at old photos of Oklahoma, you will never see a photo of a female, even working on a farm, in anything but a lovely gingham dress.  Sorry folks, but here is where the yanks got it right, and the brits simply are imagining things.  Even so, it works in this version because she doesn't wear pants for long, and because Josefina's Laurey is much more realistically drawn and human than Shirley's.  Girls simply didn't wear much makeup if any in that era, it was considered scandalous.  Shirley is beautiful in the 1940's way girls were all beautiful with gorgeous artful makeup.  I love it, but I prefer Josefina's more realistic face and acting as I mentioned before.  Since all the other females are presented in dresses sans makeup I have to say,  Result:  Win for Oklahoma 99.As for the characters of Will Parker and Ado Annie, there is no competition.  Gene Nelson and Gloria Graham simply blow away Jimmy Johnston as Will Parker and Vicki Simon as Ado Annie in this version.  Gene Nelson was a brilliant dancer who starred alongside Doris Day as the male lead in several movies.  He was tall and handsome with straight blond hair and the way he wore his black Stetson as Will Parker sends shivers down my spine.  Not to mention those tight trousers.  He also was a broadway star and his goofy sweet and very complex delivery of Will Parker just cannot be beat.  Jimmy Johnston does some great roping but that's about it.Same for Gloria Graham who found a way to play Ado Annie that is amazingly funny.  The business she does, seeming so distracted and sweet hearted and dim were just amazing.  Her delivery of a ""I'm just a girl who can't say no"" was priceless.  Plus her lyrics are funnier than the ones that Vicki Simon was forced to deliver for the same song.  I am not sure why the change was made.  Vicki Simon just seemed more like a good university level player than a seasoned professional in the part.  Result:  win for Gene Nelson and Gloria Graham of Oklahoma 55.Aunt Eller as played by Maureen Lipman was near perfection.  However, Aunt Eller played by Charlotte Greenwood IS perfection.  It probably all goes down to personal taste, as does everything in my review, but I found Charlotte Greenwood more expressive.  Her attempts to get anyone to buy Laurey's basket but Jud are actually moving.  She almost begs anyone else to buy it.  Her relief when Curly wins the bid is almost ferocious.  And in the Farmer and the Cowhand number, when she says ""but dang if I ain't as good as anybody else"" and does the little jig, that is just so close to old pioneer women that I have seen that still exist in the west.  They do use the word dang and not damn and it's charming.  Also, Charlotte's Grenwoods laugh and mannerisms are just more authentic.  however, they are also much older.  Aunt eller is said to be in her 50's in the play, and Charlotte Greenwood's aunt Eller looks to be in her 70's.  In this area Maureen Lipman was probably more realistic.  I think Maureen is the second best Aunt Eller ever, and that is nothing to be sneezed at.  I could watch her all day.  But even with that...  Result:  Win for Charlotte Greenwood.Ali Hakim is terrible in this production.  But he does get to sing that song altough it was badly orchestrated and hard to comprehend.  Eddie Albert was much better in the role.  He was simply a better actor.Win for Eddie Albert and Ali Hakim .Rod Steiger as Jud Fry was great.  But Shuler Hensley was simply better.  Firstly, his Jud was more believable and more moving, although not quite as threatening.  But that is one reason he is better.  Two women alone would simply not allow anyone as crazy as Jud Fry as acted by Rod Steiger to live within a mile of them.  And he certainly would have been kicked off the farm for the threatening way he openly threatened Curly in the bidding as well as his menacing tone with Aunt Eller when he COMMANDS her to announce him  winner of the bid.  Shuler's amazing acting turn gave Jud Fry an underlying pathos and desperation that were badly hidden but still hidden behind a respectful smile.  When he stands in front of the awakening Laurey and tells her it is time to go, he approaches her with a sweet almost worshipful smile and says ""Miss Laurey""...  Rod Steiger's Jud Fry just stands there like an ax murderer and I wouldn't have gotten in that carriage with him unless an army of Curly's sat between us.  Also at the social during the bidding for Laurey's basket, when he tells Curly that he will need his gun, he says it far less menacingly, and he is never rude to Aunt Eller.  His interpretation is simply more nuanced and meaningful.  A brilliant accomplishment.  Credit to Trevor Nunn here.  Rod Steiger was a great Curly but Shuler Hensley is the defining Jud for me forevermore.  Result:  Win for Shuler Hensley.The rest of the cast its pretty much a split decision except for Richard Whitmore as Andrew Carney, who I felt was a bit better as the father of Ado Annie.  He read the lines better but he was not quite as amusing as Sydney Livingstone in the same part.  The decision to make him a hick without teeth was interesting and amusing, but in the play the author is careful to say these people are not hicks, they speak with a western or southern drawl but take pride in it.  I am not sure which one is more correct.  I guess it all comes down to personal taste.  But since I am speaking of the whole troupe..  I do like the fact that there were children in this production which made it much more real.  I don't think I saw many small children in any in the cast of Oklahoma! 55.  However, the players were amazing in both groups.  I am forced to say tie.As for production design there is no way to compare a stage production to a film but I will say that Trevor Nunn got it mostly right.  I think the house could have been a bit less of a shack, but the sets are still gorgeous and there is corn.  I have read a lot of incorrect assessments here about Oklahoma living at the turn of the century and about it being dusty, etc.  And a lot of people think the Oklahoma in the 1955 was all wrong, but in fact it was just right.  Claremore, Oklahoma where this play it set, is the MOUNTAINOUS and VERDANT northeastern quadrant of  Oklahoma.  It looks pretty much exactly as shown in the  Oklahoma 55 version of the movie.  Right down to the peach orchards.  So in this case I think a lot of people here need to google a bit and find out the reality before posting that Oklahoma should have been set in some dusty squalid area.  It just isn't true.  As far as the Trevor Nunn production, even though the house seems a bit too much like a shack I still loved it.  In the play, the house is described and it has polished woods floors, guilded photos on the wall, and an organ.  That seems to be closer to the depiction in the original movie than the Trevor Nunn production but it's not a deal breaker.  The music and accents of the cast members in the original Movie are close, IMO, to Western than Southern.  This is a big distinction that Trevor Nunn does not seem to fully comprehend.  However, in the Trevor Nunn production most people sound authentic but like authentic SOUTHERN hicks.  I am not sure Brits understand the distinction.The men in the movie version, while looking wonderful, also are never scruffy.  The men in the Trevor Nunn production ARE scruffy.  When looking at old photos of Oklahoma the men are almost always a bit scruffy.  The women are rarely scruffy in either production nor should they be.  They took quite good care of themselves in reality and always wore starched dressed and cute bonnets and hats that look quite a bit like those that the ladies wear in both productions.  However, the artful and gorgeous makeup, while great for a 1940's movie, are simply wrong for a moden day play and Trevor Nunn was a genius in that respect.  I would give the nod to Oklahoma 99 in that department (costumes and makeup).. but that doesn't detract from the gorgeous 1943 production at all.  My only complaint at all in the 1940's production is that Shirley Jones and Gloria Graham wore too much makeup period.  I would have to say Result:  Tie.Music.  For me, the most important thing about a musical is the music.  I would give an A to both productions because it is the glorious music of Rogers and Hammerstein here but there is one problem.  The orchestration in the Oklahoma 99 version is simply not as good as the orchestration and arrangements in the Oklahoma 55 version.  The original movie is much closer to the original intent of Rogers and Hammerstein.  I give credit to Trevor Nunn for rethinking the play, which he did brilliantly, but I wish he had kept more of the original orchestration.  For instance, at the beginning, when Curly sings ""Surrey with the Fringe on the top"" ... in the original movie you can hear with each beat the sweet clap of some drum that closely resembles the sound of a horses hooves pulling a carriage.  This brilliant technique added so much to the sheer beauty of the song.  In the 99 production this tiny detail is missing, and it makes a world of difference.  Likewise during the ""All er Nuthin"" there is a little coca or flourish at the end of the song where Will kisses Ado Annie that is simply missing from the Trevor Nunn production, and I miss it so much.  That sweet little coda of trilling winds or tympani is just too chillingly beautiful to be ignored.  There are many musical flourishes that are classic Rogers and Hammerstein that are just missing from the Trevor Nunn production.The sometimes jarring musical arrangements did nothing to lyricize the wonderful by slightly discordant vocal interpretations.  Particularly so in the case of ""People will say we're in love""  The vocals by Hugh and Josefina, while wonderful, also were by design sometimes discordant.  It was a great conceit when say, Josefina's soprano turned mocking and trilling when she sang ""sweetheart, they're suspecting things...""  It never made sense to me that a girl who was trying to hide her feelings from her love would say that line...  Trevor's version solved that wonderfully and added so much to the context of the song.  BUT it also ruined the flow of the song.  The same can be said when Hugh's Curly reprises the song and sings ""your hand feels so grand in mine"" and screeches the last part of the stanza because Laurey is bending his thumb back.  It's adorable and adds so much to the play but the screech ruins the flow of the song and the emotional impact of this song when sung with feeling as Gordon MacRae sings it.  I still like this change and think it's right.  If the arrangement had been a bit more like the original it would have kept the musical flow of the song and covered up and perhaps put the musical impact of the song back on track.  Keeping its impact as a love song undiminished.  Or perhaps if Curly had sung clearly from the heart when his back was turned to Laurey when he finished the song it would have put it back on track, and yet kept the lovely reinterpretation of the song intact.  Another way would be a quick refrain of the song when Curly is walking toward the smokehouse that was truly heartfelt and exactly like the original so that the audience could get the full emotional impact of the song the way Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones sang it and still kept the wonderful business by Josefina and Hugh.Also during the ballet, the arrangements are just not as lovely as the original arrangements.  I like the dancing better  here better in the Trevor Nunn production mainly because Hugh and Josefina both dance, but the arrangements are simply not as musical or lovely and the spell of Curly and Laurey and Oklahoma! depends on this wave of beautiful music throughout.  I know some will disagree and it's all personal taste, but I just missed the old music arrangements and orchestration.  Of course the sound QUALITY is much better with modern day recording techniques than the original, so it was still wonderful to hear.  And when Trevor Nunn got it right, it was so RIGHT.  But still in all I would have to say Result:  Win Oklahoma 55.Dancing.  Such an important part of this musical and even though some of the ensemble dancing is better in the original Movie, what Trevor Nunn has done by allowing Curly and Laurey to dance the dream sequence themselves is nothing short of revolutionary.  This removes the biggest and possibly only downfall of every other version of this musical ever produced.  I know the dancing, especially in the dream sequence, is more masterful in the earlier versions, but the confusion and suspension of disbelief caused by swapping out the two leads has always tended to be the achilles heal of every other production of Oklahoma!.  I honestly think that if Fred Zinneman had taken the step taken by Trevor Nunn, and reworked the ballet sequences so that a competent dancer could dance them instead of a prima Ballerina, the musical would have been a much bigger hit.  THANK YOU TREVOR NUNN for this daring and wonderful change to the musical!  It simply cannot be stressed enough how wonderful this change is.  Definite win for Oklahoma 99.This review is of course way too  long but I have to say I am so energized and overwhelmed by the Trevor Nunn production (although it may not seem so) and of course by the original movie that I just had to write all this down just to clear my perspective.  I thoroughly loved this production, and yes on the whole while it is second to the Original movie (which for me, remains the defining film adaptation of any musical of any genre as well as the defining  version of Oklahoma!) the Trevor Nunn was a VERY close second and in some ways far superior to the original.  Frankly with the recast of Ado Annie and Ali Hakim, and with a closer interpretation of the original film score, for me THIS WOULD BE the definitive version of Oklahoma!.  It is already, for me, the definitive version of the stage play, despite it's one glaring flaw, the arrangements and orchestration.  But as I said, for me, the music is first and foremost so the result is:  Win Oklahoma 55 (but very close).I do want to thank Trevor Nunn and the entire cast of the amazing ensemble piece from the bottom of my heart.  For preserving and energizing what for me is the premiere musical of American Musical theater or for that matter, world musical theater.  Oklahoma! revolutionized Broadway in 1943 and this status alone gives this musical an eternal place in the annals of American music.  But it is so much more.  This is a poem to a bygone era of American pioneers, to the worlds natural beauty and to young love.  The lyrics make me cry with their sheer beauty and textural detail every time I hear them.  And they are wicked witty.  But the musical WAS losing relevance to today's theatre goer due to beautiful but old fashioned staging and interpretation.  Rogers and Hammerstein, unquestionably the greatest classic songwriters of the 20th Century, in my opinion, have been made more pertinent to a new generation of world theatre goer, thanks to this incredible, exquisite and nuanced version of Oklahoma!.For lovers of classic American show tunes, I would recommend the original 1955 movie .  For the modern theatre goer or people under 50 perhaps, I would recommend this version.  You cannot go wrong whichever you choose but if you love music, choose both.",5,WONDERFUL!!,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,18970,"['just', 'received', 'watched', 'beginning', 'end', 'absolutely',

772394,A31D8QKJXU93BT,B0000C23HY,"Vince Perrin ""Byline""","[10, 12]","Did you really expect Londoners to react properly when this most homespun of American classics is scaled by Aussies and Brits? In this two-disc DVD of Trevor Nunn's acclaimed production, nobody laughs. We see people enter the theatre, smile in their seats and occasionally applaud. But nobody even coughs. That's because this ""Oklahoma!"" was mostly performed in an empty house, allowing for close-ups and other filmic touches, and the illusion of a performance before a live audience deliberately created. That deception and some inept lip-syncing slightly mar an otherwise engaging record of a landmark revival.Nunn and choreographer Susan Stroman have restored the usual cuts, enhanced the orchestration, reimagined the staging, and have cast actors who can each sing, dance and actually act. As a result, the familiar characters seem fresher and their lives more pertinent. With the exception of Maureen Lipman, in a grandly understated turn as Aunt Eller, the men come off best. Jimmy Johnston is an agile rope-tricking Will, Shuler Hensley is a compelling Jud, and an eye-twinkling, curly-haired, handsome Hugh Jackman is an appealing Curley, propelling the production on his broad and (in Act 2) shirtless shoulders.So complete is the transformation that when hunky Curley and tomboy Laurey (Josefina Gabrielle) dance effortlessly into the dream ballet we don't even blink. These roles always are taken by dancers, but here the ruse is unnecessary given the triple-threat casting coup. Their duet and its reprise, ""People Will Say We're in Love,"" are beautifully sung, full of nuances. Although we are aware that we're watching a stage musical, there is nothing stagy to detract us.

And it had some innovatons which not only kept the musical fresh, but also broke ground in terms of having the main characters actually dance the dream sequence--and beautifully. The production was precise, on target and captured the real essence of the antagonism between cattlemen and farmers in the early west. Moreover, Judd's character was explored in more depth than in any other production I have seen. Overall, a real tour de force for all the principals. I was, however, disappointed that this was not performed in front of a live audience which always provides that extra energy to any performance. That said, the camera work which caught every nuance in the actors faces was truly incredible. Highly recommended.",4,Oh....what?,1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,845,"['important', 'recording', 'major', 'revival', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'american', 'musicals', 'time', 'had', 'innovatons', 'not', 'only', 'kept', 'musical', 'fresh', 'also', 'broke', 'ground', 'terms', 'having', 'main', 'characters', 'actually', 'dance', 'dream', 'sequence', 'beautifully', 'production', 'was', 'precise', 'target', 'captured', 'real', 'essence', 'antagonism', 'cattlemen', 'farmers', 'early', 'west', 'Moreover', 'Judd', 'character', 'was', 'explored', 'more', 'depth', 'other', 'production', 'have', 'seen', 'Overall', 'real', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'principals', 'was', 'however', 'disappointed', 'was', 'not', 'performed', 'front', 'live', 'audience', 'always', 'extra', 'energy', 'performance', 'said', 'camera', 'work', 'caught', 'nuance', 'actors', 'was', 'truly', 'incredible', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

Hugh Jackman is the best thing in the whole musical. His singing was just lovely and can give Gordon Macrae a run for his money.  The man who played Judd was also excellent - way creepier than Rod Steiger in the movie.  I also liked that Curly and Laurie did their own dancing in the dream sequence.The negatives:I didn't like the actress who played Laurie. She just felt obnoxious and you wonder what the big deal with her is about.  Shirley Jones was the better Laurie to be honest.The whole show felt overly long.  I nodded off a couple of times.  Maybe the movie was right in editing out Judd and Ali's solo.Which leads to Ali.  He was ok in the movie but I started to fast forward those parts because it was dragging the whole show down. The actor just wasn't very good.Overall the songs and Hugh Jackman are excellent. That's the only reason to own this. Otherwise stick with the movie.,3,Watch it for Hugh Jackman,1393027200,"02 22, 2014",2014,1033,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'Gordon', 'Macrae/', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'movie', 'got', 'movie', 'hearing', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'sing', 'tribute', 'Cameron', 'Macintosh', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'best', 'thing', 'whole', 'musical', 'singing', 'was', 'just', 'lovely', 'can', 'give', 'Gordon', 'Macrae', 'run', 'money', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Judd', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'way', 'creepier', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'movie', 'also', 'liked', 'Curly', 'Laurie', 'did', 'own', 'dancing', 'dream', 'sequence.The', 'negatives', 'did', ""n't"", 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'Laurie', 'just', 'felt', 'obnoxious', 'wonder', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'about', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'was', 'better', 'Laurie', 'be', 'honest.The', 'whole', 'show', 'felt', 'overly', 'long', 'nodded', 'off', 'couple', 'times', 'Maybe', 'movie', 'was', 'right', 'editing', 'out', 'Judd', 'Ali', 'solo.Which', 'Ali', 'was', 'ok', 'movie', 'started', 'fast', 'forward', 'parts', 'was', 'dragging', 'whole', 'show', 'down', 'actor', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good.Overall', 'songs', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'are', 'excellent', 'only', 'reason', 'own', 'Otherwise', 'stick', 'movie']",N/A
