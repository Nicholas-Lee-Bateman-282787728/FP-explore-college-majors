1260058,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B002BVYBJW,A. Gammill,"[6, 13]","NOTE: This review contains minor spoilers...you've been warned! Like many other ""Doctor Who"" fans, I've always found the spin-off ""Torchwood"" to be hit-and-miss. But with ""Children of Earth,"" the slate has been wiped clean. It's only 5 episodes, but every one hits the mark. The story of aliens returning to earth after an extended absence is nothing new, of course. But the beauty is in the execution. The site of children all over the world suddenly stopping in the their tracks, then becoming the mouthpiece for an invasion force is nothing less than chilling. But Children of Earth is so much more than that. The three surviving members of Torchwood all have their personal story arcs, fleshing out their characters like never before. While the aliens, dubbed the ""456"", attack humanity where it hurts (our children), each of the three main players examines his or her own family in ways that are often surprising. And while Torchwood has also been the most adult of the modern ""Who"" universe, it has never seemed more focused. Like the best science-fiction novels, the story touches on ideas that are far beyond the mundane. Government responsibility and even complicity, as well as individuals' rights, are a major theme. And Russell T. Davies' script isn't afraid to ask the big questions: Would you sacrifice your future to save the present? Are we doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past? Even with all its philosophic touchtones, Children of Earth is also an action-packed adventure. Production values are high; in fact, with maybe 30 or 40 minutes trimmed, it would have made an excellent big-screen movie. For fans of the show, it's a must-have (Gwen's realization that a certain well-traveled Time Lord is not going to swoop in and save the world is a fan-stroking high point). But even for casual viewers or people not familiar with the backstory, it's still first-class science-fiction.",5,The best adult science fiction story in years,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,1903,"['NOTE', 'review', 'minor', 'spoilers', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned', 'many', 'other', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'fans', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'spin-off', 'Torchwood', 'be', 'hit-and-miss', 'Children', 'Earth', 'slate', 'been', 'wiped', 'clean', 'only', '5', 'episodes', 'one', 'mark', 'story', 'aliens', 'returning', 'earth', 'extended', 'absence', 'nothing', 'new', 'course', 'beauty', 'execution', 'site', 'children', 'world', 'suddenly', 'stopping', 'tracks', 'then', 'becoming', 'mouthpiece', 'invasion', 'force', 'nothing', 'less', 'chilling', 'Children', 'Earth', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'three', 'surviving', 'members', 'Torchwood', 'have', 'personal', 'story', 'arcs', 'fleshing', 'out', 'characters', 'never', 'before', 'aliens', 'dubbed', '456', 'attack', 'humanity', 'where', 'children', 'three', 'main', 'players', 'own', 'family', 'ways', 'are', 'often', 'surprising', 'Torchwood', 'also', 'been', 'most', 'adult', 'modern', 'Who', 'universe', 'never', 'seemed', 'more', 'focused', 'best', 'science-fiction', 'novels', 'story', 'touches', 'ideas', 'are', 'far', 'mundane', 'Government', 'responsibility', 'even', 'complicity', 'as', 'well', 'individuals', 'rights', 'are', 'major', 'theme', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'script', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'ask', 'big', 'questions', 'Would', 'sacrifice', 'future', 'save', 'present', 'Are', 'doomed', 'repeat', 'mistakes', 'past', 'Even', 'philosophic', 'touchtones', 'Children', 'Earth', 'also', 'action-packed', 'adventure', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'high', 'fact', 'maybe', '30', '40', 'minutes', 'trimmed', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'excellent', 'big-screen', 'movie', 'fans', 'show', 'must-have', 'Gwen', 'realization', 'certain', 'well-traveled', 'Time', 'Lord', 'not', 'going', 'swoop', 'save', 'world', 'fan-stroking', 'high', 'point', 'even', 'casual', 'viewers', 'people', 'not', 'familiar', 'backstory', 'still', 'first-class', 'science-fiction']",Torchwood: Children of Earth
1260059,A2KB0ES96E85UZ,B002BVYBJW,Amazon Customer,"[5, 8]","... and I watch a LOT of TV.I've loved Torchwood's light-hearted feel since the beginning, but definitely appreciated its darker turns, too, and felt that it was a little more for mature audiences than Doctor Who, which I also love.  This series is decidedly the darkest, and it was so excellent in so many ways.First, the story:  ok, we've seen some stories like this.  But for me, a lot of the story is in the telling - I read ""A Christmas Carol"" every year at Christmas time.  I never get tired of it.  It's not that you've heard a story before that spoils it.  It's that you don't find anything new in it - that's when the story gets tired.  And the telling of this story is gorgeous - the 456 are a terrifying race of aliens, made moreso by the fact that you don't really see them.  All you see is the violence of their responses as they flail against the glass of the shadowy, mist-filled enclosure they reside in, spewing some sort of vile cr*p all over it.  Yikes.  There is some perfect Torchwood humor to be found, despite the anguish of losing two of their members only months earlier (Torchwood time); the banter between Ianto, Gwen and Captain Jack is light and charming, and some of the scenes are quite amusing, bt the over-arching story reaches into more pithy territory when following Frobisher, the government pawn who becomes the fall guy for the Ministry.  This poor guy has chump written all over him from the beginning, because he simply does not care what humiliation he must suffer in order to advance his career.  That's a bad plan, kids, in case you didn't realize it already.The second part of the telling is the performance:  this is a tour de force for Eve Myles and John Barrowman.  They are as solid as any actors I have ever seen, and without their complete commitment to these characters, this kind of story wouldn't be possible.  Gareth Davies was always a bit stoic, so you don't expect him to be touching, and yet, here he is, and in such a lovely and unexpected way.  The man who played Frobisher was also tremendous, and I felt in the end, his story was so tragic and so frustrating... well, you just have to watch it.The windup is a tension-filled roller coaster ride, as you try to figure out what the 456 want.  When you finally do, the mixture of horror and revulsion is hard to contain.  The final hour, the final minutes, are some of the most wrenching I have ever seen; I was actually squirming and wincing, turning my head so as not to see, it was just that hard to watch.SPOILER ALERT:  This paragraph contains a mild spoiler, so if you don't want to know a little something about it, don't read it.  A few days after watching this, a friend of mine ran into John Barrowman at ComiCon.  He sent me a picture with the caption ""Eat your heart out,"" because he knows how I love Captain Jack.  When I saw the jaunty smile, I literally had tears in my eyes, I was just so glad to see him looking well - he did not look so well at the end of this episode.All in all, though hard to watch in places, this was an amazing series.  I have not been able to bring myself watch all of it through on the Blu-Ray yet, though I have checked and find the quality so much nicer than when I watched it on the broadcast!  Dammit!  lol.

I have to say that this is a very, bracing kind of experience. It's rare that a series decides to buck the traditional 12-15 episodes of a new season for a really fast paced, shorter single story arc. We felt like we were watching a movie of the series! I will say that it is very, very dark. There were times (especially in the last few episodes) where I found myself putting my hand over my mouth, thinking ""oh no!!!"" and gripping my dog a little to hard! :) So, if you have enjoyed this series up till now I think you will like it. I don't want to give much away, but it does have some very very tragic events, fairly violent, deeply upsettling moments but it's so much in the vein of the entire series and the actors really really excel at making you believe it's all happening!

1260067,A2VMT89TCSF105,B002BVYBJW,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[6, 10]","SPOILER WARNING! MAJOR SPOILERS!The entertaining and sometimes quite corny British series ""Torchwood"" takes a decidedly darker turn in this third season miniseries, known as ""Torchwood: Children of Earth"".A bizarre alien race known only as 456 demands that humanity turn over millions of children to them. Apparently, human children emit a special chemical which the aliens use as a recreational drug! It also turns out that the British government have helped the aliens abduct children in the past. To stop the truth from leaking out, home office secretary John Frobisher sends out a hit squad to kill everyone who knows about the previous alien encounter, including Torchwood leader Jack Harkness. But, as avid ""Torchwood"" fans know, Captain Jack can't die. Various ingenious ways of getting rid of him fails, and he is soon back to take on both the 456 and the officials who betrayed him.The governments of Britain, the United States and other nations turn out to be evil, spineless or both, and agree to turn over the children to the bizarre aliens. The military promptly rounds up undesirable kids from bad neighbourhoods. The operation ends only at the last possible moment, as the hit squad that wanted Captain Jack dead suddenly turns coat and starts co-operating with Torchwood instead. Jack then forces the 456 to withdraw by turning one of the aliens' own signals against them. Unfortunately, the victory comes at a terrible price. Several of the main characters end up dead, the Torchwood Institute is in shambles, and Jack Harkness leaves Earth. The whole thing cries out for a sequel. Indeed, a fourth season of ""Torchwood"" is said to be in preparation.""Torchwood: Children of Earth"" is one of the better science fiction dramas I've seen. Every episode has its fair share of excitement, suspense and unexpected twists. The evil Frobisher becomes a tragic hero. The spotless hero Jack turns out to have a dark past. As already mentioned, the black ops people eventually decide to co-operate with the good guys. The revelation that the 456 need the children as a narcotic is suitably disgusting.The only problem with ""Children of Earth"" is, ironically, that it's *too* good. It doesn't fit very well with the two previous seasons of ""Torchwood"", with their curious blend of entertainment, weird depressions and bisexuality. ""Children of Earth"" is too dark, too pessimistic and just too serious.

1260068,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B002BVYBJW,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[9, 20]","In 1965 the British government had a shadowy series of contacts with an advanced alien species known only as the '456' (four-five-six), named after the radio frequency they used. The results of that contact were classified, but involved twelve children being handed over to them for purposes unknown. Unbeknown to the government, one of those children escaped and has grown up haunted by his memories of that experience.In 2010 all the children in the world simultaneously stop and announce, ""We are coming."" The governments of the world investigate, as do the members of Torchwood, an organisation based in Cardiff designed to investigate alien threats to Earth. However, when Torchwood comes close to exposing the secrets of forty-five years earlier, the government outlaws the group and tries to have them eliminated. Civil servant Mr. Frobisher is put on the front line by the Prime Minister as he has to negotiate with the aliens, who have indeed returned...When Torchwood launched in 2006, it was billed as Doctor Who's more adult, darker cousin. Broadcast after 9pm on BBC-3, it was supposed to take the Whoniverse in a new and more interesting direction. Unfortunately, it appeared at the time that 'darker' and 'more adult' actually translated as 'some swearing' and 'everyone on the cast is gay (kind of)'. Season 1 of Torchwood is at times borderline unwatchable. Season 2 started moving in the right direction, with some better writing and some blatant-but-amusing fanservice (James 'Spike' Marsters from Buffy and Angel as another time agent who naturally cops off with Captain Jack), but it still wasn't fulfilling its mission statement.With the third season, the BBC decided to try something different. With Doctor Who off the air for the year (four TV specials aside), they decided to not only promote Torchwood to primetime BBC-1 status, but to turn it into a five-hour mini-series airing across one week. With a level of serialisation unmatched by anything that Doctor Who has done since its return in 2005 and with producer Russell T. Davies able to exert more influence over the project (as his tenure on Who winds down and Steven Moffatt gears up to take over), it was hoped that the series would finally take off. Fans were sceptical, but intriguing trailers and a steady drip-feed of news items from the BBC convinced a lot of people to tune in and give the show the benefit of the doubt.And, against all the odds, it worked. Torchwood: Children of the Earth, as it has been dubbed, has won more acclaim than anything else related to new Doctor Who since its return four years ago. It moves with a ferocious sense of purpose, more like 24 than anything else, and its long running time allows characters to be explored more thoroughly and the storyline to unfold more logically than in the regular 45-minute episodes. They also got in some experienced scriptwriters from shows like Spooks to help work on the structure and tone of the mini-series. It genuinely is now adult. Ianto and Jack's relationship is portrayed more naturally and in keeping with the story rather than for any sensationalist reasons. Mr Frobisher's arc is stunningly well-handled, with guest star Peter Capaldi (the angel Islington from Neverwhere, among many other fine roles) giving an astonishing and award-worthy performance above and beyond the call of duty.The mini-series doesn't pull any punches. Whilst the conclusion to the story is a little contrived (featuring RTD's preferred resolution of characters talking technobabble and pounding intently on keyboards until some fancy CGI kicks in), it isn't without cost. This isn't a neat ending at all and leaves quite a few of the characters seriously mentally scarred for life. The tone is pretty bleak, with only a few rays of sunshine allowed to appear at the end.It isn't all great. The music for new Who and Torchwood has always been jarringly out of place and too loud in the mix, and it's still the same in this series. There's also a lot of shots of the characters running around various corridors and streets which sometimes seem to have been dropped in to make up the running time, but this is actually much reduced from its normal prevalence in the regular episodes. The story also requires the British government (and many of the other world governments) to behave in a snivelling and cowardly manner which led me to ponder if the writers were trying to make some kind of political point. I like to think the human race is better than Children of Earth makes us out to be. But these problems are minor.Torchwood: Children of Earth (****) is a shockingly good piece of British SF, easily the best thing to come out of the new Doctor Who since its return in 2005 and maybe the best slice of British TV SF since 1998's Ultraviolet. It is fast-paced, genuinely adult, asks hard questions and doesn't skimp on the answers and features some brilliant writing and acting.",4,Extremely impressive,1247616000,"07 15,

It was a bad decision, as few viewers are going to care all that much about the husbands, aunts, nephews, parents, daughters and lovers of the individual members of the gang. It's not so much that the family-characters are poorly drawn, although I think all agree that Gwen's hubby is a needless distraction. And the constant &#34;I must save my father,&#34; cliffhanger in Miracle Day ceased to be a cliffhanger and quickly became an excuse to go to the loo or get a coffee refill. I kept thinking about how these side-characters are dealt with in the Dr. Who series. Amy's hubby Rory and Rose's boyfriend are rather deftly incorporated into the main story, and that does not happen in the Torchwood series at all. The writers go all out convincing us that The End Is Near and Gwen and company are all that can save us, so it simply looks silly to have the Torchwood folk endangering the universe so grandad can enjoy another cup of tea. Sadly, I think it was a matter of filler, the need to stretch the episodes out a bit.

First and foremost, the bigggest difference is that there are only five episodes instead of the usual 12 but that is because all five episodes comprise one mini-series mega event where the BBC showed one episode each weeknight during a single week as opposed to one show a week. Those are the minor technical differences and here are the stylistic differences.Previous incarnations of Torchwood were a mix of frivolity, political thriller, and science fiction while series three puts the political thriller aspect front and center with the jokes and scifi taking supporting roles. The tone is emotionally taut, psychologically upsetting, and decidedly dark--all perfect motifs for a show designed only for adults. If you are wanting a Dr. Who style trip into the imagination where you get a bit scared but return with a smile on your face this is not going to be to your liking at all because this time Torchwood takes us into a nightmare realm where many of the humans in charge seem more alien and threatening than the actual aliens, who are definitely scary themselves, and that insures you won't return from  this journey with a smile unless you're a sadistic freak. Does the darkness overwhelm the show? Not at all! As I said the political thriller aspect is front and center and its pacing almost feels like this is Torchwood 24, especially seeing how each episode represents one day of time so that by the end of this series only five days have passed for the Torchwood crew.Should you buy Torchwood series 3? Well if you are more of a fan of Dr. Who and only watch Torchwood because it is a Who spin-off I'd wait and watch it as it airs to make sure it isn't too realistic to be enjoyable for you. If you prefer Torchwood over Dr. Who then definitely put your order in as you're not likely to be disappointed with the direction RTD has taken the show this time. Personally, this has been the best science fiction on the small or large screen this year (I haven't seen Moon yet so that could change) and keep in mind I am a huge Trekkie and adored the new Star Trek movie! That's right, a die hard Trekkie said Torchwood series 3 was better than Star Trek the Reboot. Granted, Trek had better blockbuster visuals and space battles but Torchwood, by far, told the better story. I also think the acting was better in Torchwood than Trek although there isn't as big as a distance between the two as there was in plot quality.",5,Best Torchwood series yet!

1260075,A3UKTEEU8TWNV7,B002BVYBJW,B. Starbuck,"[39, 56]","I'm going to preface this review by saying that I have had a love/hate relationship with Torchwood. I loved the character of Captain Jack in Doctor Who and I had huge expectations when it first came out, but was somewhat disappointed. It did seem to reach its stride mid-way through series one which, to me, seemed comic-booky and cheesy. Series two was a big improvement, with the writers fine-tuning the formula and the characters a bit.That being said, Torchwood: Children of Earth, is exactly what I had hoped for from the very beginning: dark, intelligent, mature, engrossing, well-written, and fast-paced. And I'll just say it, this ain't your run-of-the-mill Doctor Who story, with the grand hero sweeping in to save the day, and I truly applaud Russell T. Davies and the other writers for being utterly fearless with this third series. The choices faced and made by the characters are anguishing and heartbreaking indeed. Yes, there are some plot holes and inconsistencies, but the overall story and events are a harrowing experience from start to finish, and I happen to think this is one of the best, most effective stories in Davies' re-imagined Whoniverse. It's smart, thrilling ... but also, it's emotionally exhausting. You'll need a bit of a lie-down when it's all over.John Frobisher, who really is the central character in this story, is brilliantly portrayed by Peter Capaldi; he is a man whose entire life has been in civil service to his country, suddenly thrust front and center by a government who sees him only as a dispensable pawn ~ who happens to be very good at what he does. You may not warm up to him completely at first, but by the end you will be heartbroken over his character and the underhanded injustice that he has been served.The other performances were just as good. John Barrowman as Captain Jack gives us a nuanced, somewhat tortured portrayal of Jack that we have not seen before. In the first series, he was sort of a happy-go-lucky caricature that couldn't quite break free of the child-geared, Doctor Who mold, but matured a lot in the second series. With this third series, we understand the weight of his years lived, learn a little bit more about him, and feel a certain sadness every time he comes back to life, realizing what a miserable existence he's been cursed with.Eve Myles and Kai Owen are their usual, perky selves as Gwen and Rhys, with some much needed levity in an otherwise dire set of circumstances. Gareth David-Lloyd, as Ianto Jones, could be said to be the weakest of the bunch, but I found his performance to be rather touching and heartfelt, especially when he realizes just how little he truly knows Jack. And as far as his relationship with Jack, it's a shame we don't see more same-sex stories like this, because the same-sex-ness of it is completely transcended by their affection for one another.The story itself is downright creepy, especially with the manipulation of the children by the aliens, known only as the 456 (not to mention what the 456 actually want the children for), and humanity's inability to do anything about it. The political thriller side of this story is well-crafted and believable, as we watch the powers that be pull the strings and begin making decisions for the whole of humanity in the face of an unbeatable threat, whilst attempting to finagle their own lily-livered survival at the same time. And for me, watching the political posturing of these people made me wonder what our governments would do in an actual situation like this. Kind of a scary thought.The finale is one of the worst, most shocking I've ever seen ~ right up there with the finale of Blake's 7 back in the 80s ~ and yet, it is one of the very best, even though it is quite disturbing to watch. But Davies, whether you like him or not, and I know a lot of people don't, doesn't pull any punches here, he makes no apologies, and as a writer myself, I absolutely love and admire that. It takes guts and a certain arrogance to bring your own creation, beloved by many, crashing to its knees, and he chose not to take the easy, politically correct way out, but instead serves up an ending that people will either despise or be enthralled by, but which ultimately carries an unforgettable impact that will leave you breathless and in shock.It concludes leaving the future of Torchwood unresolved and in limbo, but I think all of us Whovians know exactly where Captain Jack will end up next ;). Where it goes after that is anyone's guess. But if this is the end of the series altogether, well, what a way to go!In closing, all I can say is: Bravo, Mr. Davies! THIS is the Torchwood I've been waiting for! So, tuck the kiddies in bed, grab your hankie and buckle up!

1260080,AN9J46667D80O,B002BVYBJW,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[8, 10]","""Torchwood"" has, through two series, been a show that never lived up to its enormous potential. They had a lot of great ideas, some fascinating characters and cool plots, but ultimately almost every episode came crashing down under its own weight. The series always felt like it was only ""Doctor Who"" with extra swears added in. It never felt like its own show and it never amounted to anything.Then along came ""Children of Earth"".This series of episodes tells the story of a group of aliens, known only as the 456, who show up and make a rather unpleasant demand of humanity. They communicate by making every child freeze in place and simultaneously recite ""We are coming. We are coming."" It's an unnerving effect. Torchwood in general, and Capt Jack in particular, are being hunted down by the government, which is itself scrambling to figure out how to deal with this situation. By the end of the story many things have changed, and no matter what happens henceforth, the series will never be the same again.What a stunning accomplishment this is, especially since it was written by Russel T Davies, a man whose output on ""Doctor Who"" has been somewhat uneven, to put it mildly. He managed a couple really stunning episodes there (notably ""Midnight"" from the show's fourth series), but most of his stories were dragged down by a lack of focus, stupid sex and fart jokes and characters acting like idiots. He carried that over to ""Torchwood"" initially but has really managed to get past that here. He's someone whose writing I generally dislike, and while I really loved the writing with ""Children of Earth"", it also annoyed me greatly, because it shows what RTD is capable of when he tries.Everything about this story works completely from start to finish. At no point did anything feel forced or done simply for effect. The characters are firing on all cylinders, the supporting cast (notably Peter Capaldi, in one of the best, most layered TV performances I've ever seen), are perfect with characters who are well-written and three dimensional, and, almost surprisingly, the series manages to convey a real sense of fear and dread as it goes on. I can only imagine how much it must've sucked to watch this over a course of three nights and have to wait 23 hours each night to find out what happened next. It makes waiting three months to see what happened to Picard at the end of ""The Best of Both Worlds"" seem like a walk in the park.There is one minor problem, and that's not with the show, but with the Blu-ray release of it. There's no real extra features other than a bit of ""Torchwood: Declassified"", which is essentially the same as ""Doctor Who: Confidential"". It's a behind-the-scenes show and quite interesting, and I'm glad it's here. But I miss having things like commentaries, deleted scenes and the like. For a series that's been so good about packing DVDs and Blu-rays full of everything and the kitchen sink, that's a bit of a letdown.It's also a very minor complaint. This is an amazing piece of work, and even if you've never seen ""Torchwood"" or ""Doctor Who"" I recommend picking it up. You likely won't be lost and you'll likely want to watch it with your eyes closed.",5,High-octane nightmare fuel at its best!,1274227200,"05 19, 2010",2010,3190,"['Torchwood', 'two', 'series', 'been', 'show', 'never', 'lived', 'up', 'enormous', 'potential', 'had', 'lot', 'great', 'ideas', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'cool', 'plots', 'ultimately', 'almost', 'episode', 'came', 'crashing', 'down', 'own', 'weight', 'series', 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'only', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'extra', 'swears', 'added', 'never', 'felt', 'own', 'show', 'never', 'amounted', 'anything.Then', 'along', 'came', 'Children', 'Earth', '.This', 'series', 'episodes', 'tells', 'story', 'group', 'aliens', 'known', 'only', '456', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'make', 'rather', 'unpleasant', 'demand', 'humanity', 'communicate', 'making', 'child', 'freeze', 'place', 'simultaneously', 'recite', 'are', 'coming', 'are', 'coming', 'unnerving', 'effect', 'Torchwood', 'general', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'particular', 'are', 'being', 'hunted', 'down', 'government', 'scrambling', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'deal', 'situation', 'end', 'story', 'many', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'matter', 'what', 'henceforth', 'series', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'stunning', 'accomplishment', 'especially', 'was', 'written', 'Russel', 'T', 'Davies', 'man', 'output', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'been', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'put', 'mildly', 'managed', 'couple', 'really', 'stunning', 'episodes', 'there', 'notably', 'Midnight', 'show', 'fourth', 'series', 'most', 'stories', 'were', 'dragged', 'down', 'lack', 'focus', 'stupid', 'sex', 'fart', 'jokes', 'characters', 'acting', 'idiots', 'carried', 'Torchwood', 'initially', 'really', 'managed', 'get', 'here', 'someone', 'writing', 'generally', 'dislike', 'really', 'loved', 'writing', 'Children', 'Earth', 'also', 'annoyed', 'greatly', 'what', 'RTD', 'capable', 'when', 'tries.Everything', 'story', 'completely', 'start', 'finish', 'point', 'did', 'anything', 'feel', 'forced', 'done', 'simply', 'effect', 'characters', 'are', 'firing', 'cylinders', 'supporting', 'cast', 'notably', 'Peter', 'Capaldi', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'layered', 'TV', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'perfect', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'well-written', 'three', 'dimensional', 'almost', 'surprisingly', 'series', 'convey', 'real', 'sense', 'fear', 'dread', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'must', ""'ve"", 'sucked', 'watch', 'course', 'three', 'nights', 'have', 'wait', '23', 'hours', 'night', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'waiting', 'three', 'months', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'Picard', 'end', 'Best', 'Worlds', 'seem', 'walk', 'park.There', 'one', 'minor', 'problem', 'not', 'show', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'real', 'extra', 'features', 'other', 'bit', 'Torchwood', 'Declassified', 'essentially', 'same', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Confidential', 'behind-the-scenes', 'show', 'quite', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'glad', 'here', 'miss', 'having', 'things', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'like', 'series', 'been', 'so', 'good', 'packing', 'DVDs', 'Blu-rays', 'full', 'everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'bit', 'letdown.It', 'also', 'very', 'minor', 'complaint', 'amazing', 'piece', 'work', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Torchwood', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'recommend', 'picking', 'up', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'lost', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'want', 'watch', 'eyes', 'closed']",Torchwood: Children of Earth

1260084,ABKBWR6PXD7QT,B002BVYBJW,"Dale Reynolds ""Crtiic""","[3, 8]","Review of TORCHWOOD, the 3rd Season DVD (BBC/America)By Dale ReynoldsTORCHWOOD, a BBC/Wales production, seen locally on BBC/America, just completed its third, and possibly last, season.  A spinoff from the wildly successful DOCTOR WHO, it's one of a glut of Brit Si-Fi series in which folk of today have to battle invasions of foreign species, which are knowingly, or unknowingly, bent on destroying the world as we know it.The storyline has The Torchwood Institute based in Cardiff, Wales.  Founded by Queen Victoria, its job is to protect Earth from these (generally) criminal elements.  Its leader, Captain Jack Harkness, immortal and from the 51st Century, leads a team of experts who dodge death to find more creatures.  The first and second seasons were normal television, with a fine balance between action and intimacy, fun but not exceptional.  But as the writer of the revival 31 episodes of DOCTOR WHO and the originator of the seminal gay/lesbian series, QUEER AS FOLK, the prolific Russell T. Davies has written most of the scripts for TORCHWOOD.The show is quirky, using the talents of some terrific British actors, but focusing mostly on Captain Jack.  The other stunning revelation of this show is that Cap'n Harkness -- in this century -- is emotionally attracted to men and as he is played by out-gay actor John Barrowman.  The gay Mr. Davies knows whereof he writes.  (Davies is also responsible for the six-episode Brit series, BOB & ROSE, in which a gayman falls for a single mature woman and the troubles they have with their friends and family accepting what they've built as a relationship)The third season of TORCHWOOD, CHILDREN OF EARTH, was shortened to five one-hour episodes and, now out on DVD, is a must-rent/buy/see.  The prologue, set in 1965, has Captain Harkness leading a group of children to be delivered in the hands of aliens.  In 2008 they return, taking over the voices and bodies of all the children in the world, heralding their return, and demanding what no civilized country or parent would acquiesce to.  The fascination lies in how the British government and its weasely Prime Minister (Nicholas Farrell) work to fulfill the aliens' demands, so as not to be destroyed by them.  The political machinations are utterly fascinating as written and performed.At the end of Season Two, the producers shook up its audience by killing off two of the supporting team.  In Season Three, they really let it hit the fan when they killed off another important team-member, letting loose an astonishing fusillade of invective from the show's supportive fans.  It's why I suspicion that there will be no fourth season, more's-the-pity.The casting is superb:  Eve Myles as a team member, her love-interest Rhys (Kai Owen), Harkness' love-interest, Inato Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd), and the superlative Peter Capaldi as a bureaucrat in over his head, who gives a compelling performance.  But the standout is star Barrowman, known to American audiences for his musical-theatre work here.  The suspenseful and intimate direction has been split between Andy Goddard, Ashley Way, Colin Teague and Jonathan Fox Bassett.Obviously, if one is not willing to accept the science-fiction/fantasy premise, it won't be worth your time.

Davies.It became apparent after it's premiere that Davies had eschewed thoughtful intelligent drama in favour of sub-par ""Doctor Who"" plots sensationalised with a patina of soap opera, gore and sexual polemicising. I watched the entire first series when it was originally broadcast with a growing sense of despair, caught some episodes of the second series and still saw nothing that caused me to revise my initial opinion of what was essentially a very moribund Joss Whedon imitation.I was quite content to never set eyes on the series again until a few trusted sources recommended that I take a look at it's latest incarnation.""Children Of Earth"" is frustrating because it shows us the promise of what the show could have been. The first two parts of this five part drama, yet again, sees RTD exhibit his Magpie tendencies as he serves up a story which sees the remainder of the team turn fugitive in the face of a government conspiracy and the appearance of a mysterious alien species known as ""The 456""; it really is ridiculous, badly written, nonsensical padding of the worst kind which owes a considerable debt to the likes of24: Seasons 1-7andQuatermass (1979)whilst exhibiting neither the excitement or intelligence of either of those shows. I must admit, I nearly switched off at this point.However, parts three and four are where the series really shines. The scenes which see ""Permanent Under Secretary to the Home Office"", John Frobisher, (brilliantly played by Peter Capaldi in a delightful subversion of his pugnacious chief-whip fromThe Thick of It - Series One - 2-DVD Set ( The Thick of It - Entire Series 1 )  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2.4 Import - United Kingdom]) opening tentative communications with the 456 and a deeply Machiavellian incarnation of the UK cabinet attempting to work out how they should react to the unpalatable demands of the alien visitors are nothing short of brilliant. In many ways, I found myself wishing that these portions of the show had actually been written as a stand-alone drama which examined how a contemporary sitting government would react to a 'first-contact' situation.Unfortunately, RTD destroys the intelligence quotient of the drama just as quickly as he ramps it up by resorting to the usual sub-par Whedonesque gimmickry, soap opera and ham-fisted grandstanding. The ending is both deeply predictable and wholly unsatisfying and its all a bit too smugly self-satisfied and 'deus-ex-machina' for it's own good. That and everyone insists on doing a very silly scissor-hand style of run throughout the whole thing.The first two series of ""Torchwood"" never lived up to their potential. ""Children Of Earth"" doesn't quite manage that either - but at times it comes damned close.",3,Very Nearly Became The Adult Drama That We'd Been Promised In The First Place...,1272499200,"04 29, 2010",2010,2878,"['Torchwood', 'series', 'never', 'fulfilled', 'promise', 'adult', 'science', 'fiction', 'drama', 'originally', 'expounded', 'creator', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies.It', 'became', 'apparent', 'premiere', 'Davies', 'had', 'eschewed', 'thoughtful', 'intelligent', 'drama', 'favour', 'sub-par', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'plots', 'sensationalised', 'patina', 'soap', 'opera', 'gore', 'sexual', 'polemicising', 'watched', 'entire', 'first', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'growing', 'sense', 'despair', 'caught', 'episodes', 'second', 'series', 'still', 'saw', 'nothing', 'caused', 'revise', 'initial', 'opinion', 'what', 'was', 'essentially', 'very', 'moribund', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'imitation.I', 'was', 'quite', 'content', 'never', 'set', 'eyes', 'series', 'again', 'few', 'trusted', 'sources', 'recommended', 'take', 'look', 'latest', 'incarnation', 'Children', 'Earth', 'frustrating', 'promise', 'what', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'five', 'part', 'drama', 'yet', 'again', 'RTD', 'exhibit', 'Magpie', 'tendencies', 'up', 'story', 'remainder', 'team', 'turn', 'fugitive', 'face', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'appearance', 'mysterious', 'alien', 'species', 'known', '456', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'badly', 'written', 'nonsensical', 'padding', 'worst', 'kind', 'considerable', 'debt', 'likes', 'of24', 'Seasons', '1-7andQuatermass', '1979', 'whilst', 'exhibiting', 'excitement', 'intelligence', 'shows', 'must', 'admit', 'nearly', 'switched', 'off', 'point.However', 'parts', 'three', 'four', 'are', 'where', 'series', 'really', 'shines', 'scenes', 'see', 'Permanent', 'Secretary', 'Home', 'Office', 'John', 'Frobisher', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Peter', 'Capaldi', 'delightful', 'subversion', 'pugnacious', 'chief-whip', 'fromThe', 'Thick', 'One', '2-DVD', 'Set', 'Thick', 'Entire', 'Series', '1', '[', 'NON-USA', 'FORMAT', 'PAL', 'Reg.2.4', 'Import', 'United', 'Kingdom', ']', 'opening', 'tentative', 'communications', '456', 'deeply', 'Machiavellian', 'incarnation', 'UK', 'cabinet', 'attempting', 'work', 'out', 'how', 'should', 'react', 'unpalatable', 'demands', 'alien', 'visitors', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'many', 'ways', 'found', 'wishing', 'portions', 'show', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'written', 'stand-alone', 'drama', 'examined', 'how', 'contemporary', 'sitting', 'government', 'would', 'react', ""'first-contact"", 'situation.Unfortunately', 'RTD', 'intelligence', 'quotient', 'drama', 'just', 'as', 'quickly', 'up', 'resorting', 'usual', 'sub-par', 'Whedonesque', 'gimmickry', 'soap', 'opera', 'ham-fisted', 'grandstanding', 'ending', 'deeply', 'predictable', 'wholly', 'unsatisfying', 'bit', 'too', 'smugly', 'self-satisfied', ""'deus-ex-machina"", 'own', 'good', 'everyone', 'insists', 'doing', 'very', 'silly', 'scissor-hand', 'style', 'run', 'whole', 'thing.The', 'first', 'two', 'series', 'Torchwood', 'never', 'lived', 'up', 'potential', 'Children', 'Earth', ""n't"", 'quite', 'manage', 'times', 'damned', 'close']",Torchwood: Children of Earth

As such the government conspiracy and cover-up theme may be relevant to the British today (look at their government scandals) but has been done to death with the likes of X-Files and Millennium in the 1990s by the Americans. The premise of the show and the choices of the government are therefore not very credible to me, perhaps because I find it hard to believe that any government even the British government would stoop so low or surrender so easily to an alien menace, whose capacity for destruction was not even proven, but merely hinted at for most of the mini-series.There was no demonstration of the viciousness of the ""456"" or the futility of resistance sufficient for me to agree that the government had no choice but to comply with the ""ransom"" demands. As such, they seem to capitulate too easily, and is perhaps a personal (or British) bias that their government is feckless, spineless, and not to be trusted.Political commentary in entertainment can be very satisfying when done right, and done intelligently. When done badly, they are as welcomed (and as subtle) as evangelists at your door when you're about to sit down to dinner. Or a Michael Moore movie. But at least with a Michael Moore documentary, you know what you're buying.As such, I'm very sorry but Children of Earth is a rather parochial morality tale that may not resonate with most people outside the British Isles, though the show may re-kindle some of the passion of die-hard X-philes.",2,Torch burnt out?,1256342400,"10 24, 2009",2009,1539,"['Torchwood', 'Children', 'Earth', 'very', 'British', 'perspective', 'psyche', 'such', 'government', 'conspiracy', 'cover-up', 'theme', 'may', 'be', 'relevant', 'British', 'today', 'look', 'government', 'scandals', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'likes', 'X-Files', 'Millennium', '1990s', 'Americans', 'premise', 'show', 'choices', 'government', 'are', 'therefore', 'not', 'very', 'credible', 'perhaps', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'government', 'even', 'British', 'government', 'would', 'stoop', 'so', 'low', 'surrender', 'so', 'easily', 'alien', 'menace', 'capacity', 'destruction', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'proven', 'merely', 'hinted', 'most', 'mini-series.There', 'was', 'demonstration', 'viciousness', '456', 'futility', 'resistance', 'sufficient', 'agree', 'government', 'had', 'choice', 'comply', 'ransom', 'demands', 'such', 'seem', 'capitulate', 'too', 'easily', 'perhaps', 'personal', 'British', 'bias', 'government', 'feckless', 'spineless', 'not', 'be', 'trusted.Political', 'commentary', 'entertainment', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'satisfying', 'when', 'done', 'right', 'done', 'intelligently', 'When', 'done', 'badly', 'are', 'welcomed', 'subtle', 'evangelists', 'door', 'when', ""'re"", 'sit', 'down', 'dinner', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'movie', 'least', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'documentary', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'buying.As', 'such', ""'m"", 'very', 'sorry', 'Children', 'Earth', 'rather', 'parochial', 'morality', 'tale', 'may', 'not', 'resonate', 'most', 'people', 'British', 'Isles', 'show', 'may', 're-kindle', 'passion', 'die-hard', 'X-philes']",Torchwood: Children of Earth

1260100,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B002BVYBJW,Gary P. Cohen,"[14, 29]","I had never seen an episode of Torchwood before.  However I had heard about it and when I saw the ads for this new miniseries, I decided to check it out.  Never have I seen a more depressing, nihilistic, downbeat mess.  Now I realize that all sci-fi doesn't necessarily have to be upbeat, I've watched enough episodes of the X-Files to know that.  However, the least you should do is make some sense. This series was utterly idiotic and depressing, just for the sake of being depressing.  I will cut to the chase and if you do not want to know any plot points, stop reading here as I will be revealing the major plotline of the show.I will jump forward to about the 3rd episode.  Some very nasty alien has contacted the British government that he wants to meet with them.  So they take a very secure government building, create a tank and fill it with the poisonous environment that he needs to breathe. (Sort of like the old Ambassidor Kosh on the great Babylon 5.)  He drops in and starts negotiating with a British bureaucrat while the P.M. and his stooges watch.  Turns out he wants 325,000 schoolchildren turned over to him.  It appears that he was here before in 1965 and the government handed over 12 schoolchildren in exchange for a flu vaccine.(It is never mentioned where they managed to get these kids, I guess the writer felt it wasn't important.)  The man who handed the kids over was Torchwood's Captain Jack.  Now it it 2009 and due to inflation I guess, the alien wants a lot more.  The British government blusters  briefly about fighting the aliens.  However all the alien has to do is seal off the government building and poison everyone there and the government caves right in.  (This is sure not ID4 or War of the Worlds.)  Now what has Torchwood been doing to prevent this.  They get a young civil servant to put on special contact lenses so that they can see and hear what is going on.  And Captain Jack and the other male member of the team charge in and confront the alien with a couple of .45s, only to be immediately poisoned.  This gives Captain Jack an opportunity to kiss his homosexual lover goodbye.Now throughout this, the UN and the President of the U.S. are barely mentioned despite the fact that the aliens are demanding children from all over the world. (Apparently they use something the kids produce to feel good, basically, I guess, they get high on the kids.)  On the scene arrives a black American 3 star General who is even nastier and more ruthless than the British P.M., who he continuously just bosses around. (I guess American Lieutenant Generals outrank British Prime Ministers.) Maybe I'm just being nationalistic but I can't imagine any American President, other than perhaps the one we are currently stuck with, calmly giving in to the aliens and providing them with thousands of American schoolchildren.  But thats just me.Anyway the roundup of children starts. Torchwood has a tape of the bureaucrats discussing the plot.  They make a half-hearted threat to put it on the Internet. However when they are threatened with arrest and told that it won't matter anyway, they decide to not bother posting it. (Perhaps thousands could be hiding their children and fighting back, thats why.  This show is unbelievably stupid.)  The main British diplomat is promised that his 2 daughters will not have to go.  Suddenly, for no reason, the P.M. changes his mind. (I guess 325,000 wasn't enough, they needed 2 more.)  The bureaucrat promptly goes home, shots his wife, 2 daughters and himself.  Very upbeat.The army starts rounding up schoolchildren and only about a dozen tough guys fight back. (We hear in passing that others are fighting back, but we don't see it. Budgetary restraints, I guess.)  Gwen of Torchwood assists in helping her dead partner's sister and about a dozen kids flee the roundup, never does she make any attempt to grab a gun and just fight back.  Captain Jack, who has risen from the dead (his specialty,) is released from prison and in about an hour figures out that soundwaves from the children can be used to destroy the aliens. (Sounds a bit like Tim Burton's ""Mars Attacks."")  Of course, the Captain has to use and kill his own grandchild in the process of proving it. What a guy!So the alien leaves in a hurry and, using the Torchwood contact lenses, some female bureaucrats film the P.M. plotting to blame it on the Americans (poor us.)  They basically tell him that they will be running things from now on (despite the fact they they were in on his plot to give away the 325,000 children from the beginning and did not object too much.)And what of Torchwood?  Captain Jack leaves the earth in his spaceship and Gwen looks forward to having her baby. (I forgot to mention she was pregnant.)As stated at the beginning, I found this to be utterly stupid and downbeat. I can't imagine who could have come up with such a jaundiced and utterly negative plot with so many idiotic plotholes that I have barely scratched the surface.  This was my first experience with Torchwood and it will undoubtedly be my last.",1,What a Mess,1249171200,"08 2, 2009",2009,5080,"['had', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'Torchwood', 'However', 'had',

1260103,AK7D1BHZOSOL1,B002BVYBJW,General Pete,"[1, 1]","I had avoided this series for a long time because I had read on Amazon about how bad it was but I have to respectfully disagree.  I have always loved Doctor Who new and old but I never much cared for the first two seasons of Torchwood John Barrowman was great as Captain Jack and rest of the team was fine but I never got the sense that the show ever evolved beyond a ""Villain of the Week"" scenario.  Torchwood never fought anything that you felt could have a massive impact on the lives of the team.  I had to reevaluate this feeling in light of the season 2 finale but for the vast majority of two seasons the good guys always.Now Children of Earth blew any preconceived notions I had right out of the water.  The idea of the team facing one threat for a period of time shorter then the length of a week works.  From the very beginning you have an idea that the team is in real danger and when you are expecting them all to make it out safe with the use of an appropriate established plot device that has appeared in the past it doesn't happen and there are casualties.  This is one of the reasons that I think many people had a hard time with this series but I think the knowledge that certain characters aren't immortal (except for Jack) adds to the impact.So you have Drama on a Torchwood show that works and chemistry of the cast that fires on all cylinders and villains that are effective and pose a serious threat.  I cannot say enough good things about the 456 they are chilling and I would have liked there role to have been expanded.I do have to say something negative and will try  as nonspecific as I can there are two people that were added to the show that serve as an easy exit.  We had know knowledge of these people previously and once we are aware of why the 456 came to earth and what they want the children for the fateof one character is a forgone conclusion.  I think it would have been more effective for this young character to have been introduced in the second season and inserted into the background.  It would have been a difficult proposition between fighting monsters and running Torchwood Jack doesn't have much of a home life but it would have been more effective emotionally then using the character in a Deus Ex. setup.Overall-In spite of some flaws Torchwood finally hit its stride with this season or ""serise"" as our British cousins would say.  The way the British Government is protrayed is excellent first secure immunity for your own family and then use the military and police that you control to do the dirty work of an invading force.  Whatever else you can say about the series I think it was amazing that the human race was on its own this time no man in a magic blue box came to save the day.",4,Much better then I expected,1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,2738,"['had', 'avoided', 'series', 'long', 'time', 'had', 'read', 'Amazon', 'how', 'bad', 'was', 'have', 'respectfully', 'disagree', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'new', 'old', 'never', 'much', 'cared', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Torchwood', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'was', 'great', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'rest', 'team', 'was', 'fine', 'never', 'got', 'sense', 'show', 'ever', 'evolved', 'Villain', 'Week', 'scenario', 'Torchwood', 'never', 'fought', 'anything', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'massive', 'impact', 'lives', 'team', 'had', 'reevaluate', 'feeling', 'light', 'season', '2', 'finale', 'vast', 'majority', 'two', 'seasons', 'good', 'guys', 'always.Now', 'Children', 'Earth', 'blew', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'had', 'right', 'water', 'idea', 'team', 'facing', 'one', 'threat', 'period', 'time', 'shorter', 'then', 'length', 'week', 'works', 'very', 'beginning', 'have', 'idea', 'team', 'real', 'danger', 'when', 'are', 'expecting', 'make', 'out', 'safe', 'use', 'appropriate', 'established', 'plot', 'device', 'appeared', 'past', ""n't"", 'happen', 'are', 'casualties', 'one', 'reasons', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'series', 'think', 'knowledge', 'certain', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'immortal', 'Jack', 'impact.So', 'have', 'Drama', 'Torchwood', 'show', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'cylinders', 'villains', 'are', 'effective', 'pose', 'serious', 'threat', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', '456', 'are', 'chilling', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'there', 'role', 'have', 'been', 'expanded.I', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'something', 'negative', 'will', 'try', 'as', 'nonspecific', 'can', 'are', 'two', 'people', 'were', 'added', 'show', 'serve', 'easy', 'exit', 'had', 'know', 'knowledge', 'people', 'previously', 'once', 'are', 'aware', 'why', '456', 'came', 'earth', 'what', 'want', 'children', 'fateof', 'one', 'character', 'forgone', 'conclusion', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'young', 'character', 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'second', 'season', 'inserted', 'background', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'proposition', 'fighting', 'monsters', 'running', 'Torchwood', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'home', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'emotionally', 'then', 'using', 'character', 'Deus', 'Ex', 'setup.Overall-In', 'spite', 'flaws', 'Torchwood', 'finally', 'hit', 'stride', 'season', 'serise', 'British', 'cousins', 'would', 'say', 'way', 'British', 'Government', 'protrayed', 'excellent', 'first', 'secure', 'immunity', 'own', 'family', 'then', 'use', 'military', 'police', 'control', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'invading', 'force', 'else', 'can', 'say', 'series', 'think', 'was', 'amazing', 'human', 'race', 'was', 'own', 'time', 'man', 'magic', 'blue', 'box', 'came', 'save', 'day']",Torchwood: Children of Earth
1260104,A2J57EQ9KPGXR9,B002BVYBJW,"H. A Huffman ""haumf""","[9, 19]","Love it or Hate it, Torchwood: Children of Earth was a slam-bang ending to a phenominal series. Torchwood explored alot of rough territory: Death, Sex, Sacrifice, Love, Loss, Lonliness and Sense of Purpose. This was done expertly by the combination of a great cast and screenplays. Children of Earth, the finale to the current series (I expect Torchwood to be back soon) is a story in the same calibre as some of the best Torchwood tales of the previous seasons.Torchwood is not Doctor Who. People die. It centers around a bunch of dysfunctional people, normal humans, defending the Earth against alien invasions and sometimes human ""monsters"". The show worked because the ""heroes"" all had flaws, including the main character, Jack Harkness, who is immortal who cannot die but is at times surrounded by death. Gwen Cooper, the other main character in the show, is dragooned into Torchwood but manages to humanize the organization and Jack as well - forcing him to deal with people, especially Gwen, on a more intimate level. The other characters all have some flaw that gets them into trouble (Ianto - he loves Jack, but Jack's lovers don't fare well. The Doctor - he did'nt take life too seriously until it was taken away from him. The computer specialist - always out-of-place until she was in the wrong place at the wrong time for the last time.)**SOME SPOILERS**Consequently, this 5 part series finale centers around the same themes, including some particularly disturbing ""human monsters"". When an very alien race called the 456 arrives on Earth demanding children, it at first looked like it was time for Torchwood to go into action, but instead chaos ensues and Jack is left to make some truly horrible choices.People have angrily written reviews scorning the writers for all the deaths, but if you think about it, the end makes alot of sense. Jack lives because he can't be killed (he does dies 5 million years later - in Doctor Who) and Gwen lives because she controlled her flaws and has a support system in the form of her husband. The ending had me applauding, it could not have been better.I can't wait for the next chapter of the marvelous story.

1260107,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B002BVYBJW,Jason Bean,"[8, 14]","To start off, I am NOT a huge fan of the series Torchwood. To me the show has come off as an overly melodramatic and violent version of the X-Files. It's had some fun but never reached the height of it's predecessor Dr. Who. This season completely changed that.For one thing the story is much vaster in scope than anything Torchwood or even Dr Who has tried before. The plot is simple enough: Aliens come to earth threatening the planets children, but this is no typical ""we must save the children!"" mish-mash. Everything is played to believability by showing us the back-door politics of the government and their reactions as well as our usual Heroes. This season does have it's usual melodramatic moments (again sometimes OVERLY melodramatic) but none of these scenes can get in the way of the powerful scenes that will stay with you long after the final episode.None of this would be possible of course without the powerhouse performances by it's talented cast. Acting has never been Torchwood's strong suit, but season regulars John Barrowman, Eve Myles and Gareth David-Lloyd have never been better. Equally good is Liz May Brice (powerful and chilling as a government assassin), Paul Copley (compelling and believable as an alien abductee), and especially Peter Capaldi who adds conviction and vulnerability as a government stooge forced to make some hard choices.This season isn't perfect and some of it will probably be lost on people who've never seen Torchwood, but for fans and casual viewers this season is a MUST on DVD.",5,Fantastic!

Yet it never seemed to catch fire. The earlier seasons were decent enough and were populated with terrific actors, but they never found a story that worked for them.Then the show was booted to another channel, and given a reduced number of episodes. It was a real boot in the face to the show, and most programs would have crumpled. Instead, ""Torchwood"" turned lemons into the best damned lemonade you've ever tasted.This season is good. It's damned good. It's funny, it's exciting, but above all, it's dark. Really dark. Like scary, depressing, haunts you for weeks after you've seen it dark.The premise is that aliens known as the 456 (because of the frequency they use with which to communicate) have come to Earth. Or rather, come *back*. They've been here once before, we learn, and things did not go well then.So now they're coming back, and they have demands. Demands which test the very moral fabric of our society. Giving in to these demands would turn us into monsters; NOT giving into these demands would turn us into corpses.What to do?Terrific, terrific drama. Every character hits his stride.I simply can not recommend this enough. But I do warn you it's DARK with a capital D, a capital A, a capital R, and a capital K. And add some exclamation points at the end for good measure. As such, while they're nothing explicitly violent or sexual, it WILL affect you emotionally.Sadly, after this season, the BBC partnered with the US to produce ""Torchwood: Miracle Day"", which, while better than most American television these days, fell far short of the mark of this terrific season.Oh, in case you haven't seen the previous seasons and want to jump in with this season, here's all you need to know:Torchwood: A quasi-secret organizationcreated by Queen Victoriato understand and combat extraterrestrial menaces.Gwen Cooper: Our viewpoint character. Former police officer, brought into Torchwood. Married to Rhys.Captain Jark Harkness: Former time-traveller from the future, but stuck in the present now. Head of Torchwood. For reasons that are hard to explain briefly, is immortal: he can be killed, but he always comes back to life. He's lived a long, long life, and has died many, many times. He is omni-sexual: he will flirt with, and have sex with, anything sentient: man, woman, Sontarran, whatever. However, right now, he's in a committed relationship with Ianto Jones.Ianto Jones: Stolid, wry, dedicated. He's the backbone of Torchwood; the guy who makes all the little details come together. Suit and tie. Up until now, completely heterosexual, but Captain Jack has entranced him and now they're in a committed relationship: something that Ianto finds both wonderful and uncomfortable.That's it.

To begin with, the last thing the Doctor Who universe needed was another ""children in peril"" storyline.  One of the best things about the first two seasons of Torchwood was how relatively adult oriented and kid free they were by comparison to Who.  But here we get kids a-plenty and each one cuter and more photogenic than the last.The story itself (spoilers) concerns aliens who are so advanced they can travel between the stars at will yet are incapable of synthesizing whatever chemical it is they extract from prepubescent children in order to get themselves high.  They also can't build environment suits for themselves and spend more time puking pea soup than Linda Blair.  A few giggles for the kiddies the producers are clearly trying to entertain, I suppose.The latter half of these five loooong hours are filled with much wringing of hands as characters make one ridiculous decision after another.  Sadly, its all just so contrived.  The folks in charge take the invaders at their word that they can destroy humanity without raising a sweat.  But if the aliens are so tough, why don't they just take however many children they want and be done with it?  No alternative methods are ever even considered when dealing with the aliens.  ""You want kids, you got 'em, just not mine"" are essentially the politicians' attitudes.I haven't seen so many people so boringly debate so many contrived moral questions and ambiguities since the last Star Trek series was canceled.  Contrived really is the word of the day here.  Every last thing that happens in the final couple episodes is completely contrived to arrive at the predetermined ending, which causes the whole darn thing to come off as oh-so-painfully fake and dishonest.

I absolutley love Doctor Who, and I loved Captain Jack's appearances on Doctor Who, but I always found Torchwood to be rather dumb and really silly with they way they tried to make it ""dark"" by having lots of sex & swearing.  It all seemed to be just trying too hard to be different from Doctor Who.So I was shocked by how good ""Children of the Earth"" really is, not just for Torchwood, but for sci-fi/espinoage thrillers in general.  The first 3 episodes are classics of the paranoid action genre, with the stakes rising constantly and the ground falling out from under the characters over and over again.  The fact that the government see's Torchwood secret organization and raises them by an even more secret organization brings a great sense of unpredictability to the storytelling.The main characters are many times more interesting here than they ever were in the first two seasons, and the new characters introduced are fun and fully developed.  Of particular note are a handful of mid-level government officials who find themselves with the fate of the world literally resting upon their shoulders because the elected officials don't want to take any responsibility.  These poor and misguided people go about their business, doing their jobs and keeping their heads down because they are paid to maintain the status quo and not question directives.  They are ordinary people doing terrible things because they are ""just following orders.""  The story brings an unexpected level of empathy for these functionaries who labor in obscurity doing mostly good things for most of their careers but suddenly find themselves being forced to chose between the career they've worked for most of their lives and what is, in almost any sense, the ""right"" thing to do.When things settle into a less spy and more sci-fi atmosphere in the final two episodes the series manages to maintain the momentum and build things to an almost unbearable level of tension entering the climactic moments.  The final series of events is stunning, tragic and epic, putting ""Children of the Earth"" firmly into the realm of classic science fiction storytelling.The only bad part is that I have no idea how they can manage to keep this level of quality going.

1260119,AZCA6JQZWAEVS,B002BVYBJW,Joseph D Baptist,"[2, 7]","Torchwood season 1 was great, but season two drifted and wandered without any direction, with writers creating situations (Owen's condition) that further episodes had to deal with in a very taxing and contrived manner.

Audiences around the world will be held spellbound by this dark and horrifying miniseries.  I watched most of the episodes back-to-back - straight through in one sitting.  TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH kept me on the edge of my seat with a fantastic story, a break-neck pace, and heart-pounding suspense and tension.TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH does exactly what all truly excellent science fiction does; it makes us question what it means to be human; question our own actions, words, and deeds.  In TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH, brilliant writer Russell T. Davies asks and answers the question ""Do the needs of the many out weight the needs of the few, or the one?"" And the answer is shocking, gut-wrenching, and absolutely heart-breaking.The premise of TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH is truly every parent's worst nightmare - completely unimaginable except in our most horrific dreams.  The politicians portrayed here are the true monsters of the story, not the aliens (although they are a pretty dodgy crowd, themselves.)  The ""scenarios"" batted about the political leaders are disgusting.  It shows how little faith they have in human beings and the world.The British have never been afraid to kill off main characters, change the direction of a beloved series, or recast a leading roll.  In many cases, this philosophy can infuse a series with new vigor, new fans, and better plot lines.  TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH is no exception.  We have lost main characters before and most likely will do so in the future.  Dr. Who, Primeval, Hex, and many other successful British series have gone through similar transformations.Finally, IMHO, Captain Jack fans have nothing to fear.  He has gone on intergalactic walk-about before, and he has always come back, once he has resolved what he needs to resolve.  This one may take more time...a lot more time... but I believe he will return.  Gwen will carry on until he is ready - that is what she does.  Maybe with the help of Lois Habiba, who would be a nice a very addition to the cast.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,WOW! WOW!

1260127,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B002BVYBJW,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[2, 6]","Children of Earth is not meant for Torchwood newbies.  It has an immensely convoluted narrative which contains too many references back to prior events in the series.  Unless you've watched the first two seasons, Children of Earth will be too cool for the room, and it will probably leave you more confused than enlightened.But if you've been keeping up, this five-episode single arc pushes the characters beyond their previous limits.  They face a much bigger, better-organized, and more powerful foe than ever before, and this time, they do it without their alien tech or even a central base of operations.  On the run like fugitives, Torchwood has to face down a menace more awful than any they've confronted yet: children.The five hour format allows more scope than the usual one-hour episodes, with braided narrative lines converging on a final confrontation.  This permits the story to have the magnitude of an epic novel while losing none of TV's pulse-pounding action.  Unfortunately, it also means ramrodding in four false climaxes, always the risk with serial narrative.  But the scope makes up for this shortcoming.Rather than conventional sci-fi horror, this novel for TV sets up a lingering Lovecraftian dread in which what we don't know is scarier than what we do.  And what we don't know turns out, in part, to be Captain Jack, whose limitless life carries the cost of accruing infinite guilt.  Every victory comes for Jack at great cost, and he can't gain ground without hurting those he most cares about.Not that the production is flawless.  Russel T. Davies' characteristic dry wit is in short supply.  Jack's epilogue feels forced on, the work of a creative team that doesn't know if they will get the nod for another run at the series.  This whole show has the fatalistic feel of a last hurrah, and even in the happy moments, the actors perform like they're waiting for the axe to fall.That said, Torchwood fans will find plenty they will like in this relentlessly epic narrative.  If this does turn out to be the last gasp of an ending show, they went out in one awesome blaze of glory.

While Torchwood investigates this threat, a new assistant to Secretary of the Home Office, John Frobisher (Peter Capaldi), Lois Habiba (Cush Jumbo), ends up involved in the strange new turn of events more than she could ever have expected.Children of Earth can only be described as a masterpiece of television storytelling. Reducing the episode count to five and turning itself into a miniseries was a brilliant decision. The narrative of the season is strong and engaging all the way through, helped by excellent themes, tight focus, and superb pacing, keeping everything tense and exciting all the way through. The mystery of who these aliens are is not only a thrilling one, but a scary one as well, and there is not a dull moment to be had in the search for answers as to who they are and what they want, answers which will come at a shock to many viewers. On top of that lies an excellent analysis of the extremes people will go to when threatened, as well as the hard decisions people have to make. Due to all of this, this series is an emotional ride from beginning to end, one that will break hearts as well as mend them. It may be some of the best television out there, but Children of Earth is definitely also some of the hardest to watch for that very reason, and viewers will go through the gamut of emotion watching it. Torchwood was always just as character focused as its parent show, Doctor Who, and Children of Earth is no different. Although the Torchwood team is smaller now, the ensemble cast of characters introduced here are all well-developed and interesting. The protagonists are full of likeable, strong characters, with Lois Habiba and Rhys Williams having some great growth over the course of the episodes, while the antagonists are all perfectly ""love-to-hate"", often showing their own depths and intricacies that cast a new light on their motivations and personalities. The story and characters are all complimented by a great cast of actors who play their parts with energy and emotion. All of the emotion here would not exist if it weren't for the great acting from the likes of Barrowman, Myles, David-Lloyd, Jumbo, Capaldi, and so many more.The effects in this series of Torchwood may not be as high-end as others, where the aliens were more seen, but that only benefits it all. The mysteriousness of the alien threat here is enhanced by the little you see of them, a minimalistic move that makes the unknown threat that much scarier. There are definitely moments for effects, such as a major explosion early on or the arrival of the alien threat, but these are still kept to a minimum to ground the action and improve the unknown mysteriousness of the antagonists this time around. The soundtrack, however, is haunting and thrilling, providing the right moods at the right moments.Torchwood: Children of Earth is, without a doubt, a shining example of television. It's intelligent, thematic, emotional, and all the right kinds of thrilling. Everything about Children of Earth is excellent, from the writing to the production to the acting. Not a single part of it really disappoints. Fans of the series have no need to worry about this change in direction (something that would be continued in Miracle Day). They only need to sit back and experience this ride.",5,A television masterpiece.,1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,4056,"['strange', 'yet', 'fitting', 'move', 'Torchwood', 'turn', 'episodic', 'monster-of-the-week', 'procedural', 'parent', 'show', 'heavily-serialized', 'miniseries', 'move', 'showing', 'many', 'similarities', 'similar', 'move', 'shown', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'own', 'spin-off', 'Angel', 'best', 'though', 'providing', 'masterpiece', 'television', 'Torchwood', 'Children', 'Earth.After', 'unfortunate', 'deaths', 'Toshiko', 'Sato', 'Owen', 'Harper', 'Torchwood', 'Three', 'was', 'reduced', 'only', 'three', 'members', 'Gwen', 'Cooper', 'Eve', 'Myles', 'Ianto', 'Jones', 'Gareth', 'David-Lloyd', 'Jack', 'Harkness', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'Eventually', 'adapt', 'acclimate', 'new', 'situation', 'good', 'again', 'However', 'one', 'day', 'child', 'world', 'motionless', 'new', 'alien', 'threat', 'coming', 'Earth', 'Torchwood', 'threat', 'new', 'assistant', 'Secretary', 'Home', 'Office', 'John', 'Frobisher', 'Peter', 'Capaldi', 'Lois', 'Habiba', 'Cush', 'Jumbo', 'up', 'involved', 'strange', 'new', 'turn', 'events', 'more', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'expected.Children', 'Earth', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'masterpiece', 'television', 'storytelling', 'Reducing', 'episode', 'count', 'five', 'turning', 'miniseries', 'was', 'brilliant', 'decision', 'narrative', 'season', 'strong', 'engaging', 'way', 'helped', 'excellent', 'themes', 'tight', 'focus', 'superb', 'pacing', 'keeping', 'everything', 'tense', 'exciting', 'way', 'mystery', 'who', 'aliens', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'thrilling', 'one', 'scary', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'dull', 'moment', 'be', 'had', 'search', 'answers', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'want', 'answers', 'will', 'come', 'shock', 'many', 'viewers', 'top', 'excellent', 'analysis', 'extremes', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'when', 'threatened', 'as', 'well', 'hard', 'decisions', 'people', 'have', 'make', 'Due', 'series', 'emotional', 'ride', 'beginning', 'end', 'one', 'will', 'break', 'hearts', 'as', 'well', 'mend', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'television', 'there', 'Children', 'Earth', 'definitely', 'also', 'hardest', 'watch', 'very', 'reason', 'viewers', 'will', 'go', 'gamut', 'emotion', 'watching', 'Torchwood', 'was', 'always', 'just', 'character', 'focused', 'parent', 'show', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Children', 'Earth', 'different', 'Torchwood', 'team', 'smaller', 'now', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'characters', 'introduced', 'here', 'are', 'well-developed', 'interesting', 'protagonists', 'are', 'full', 'likeable', 'strong', 'characters', 'Lois', 'Habiba', 'Rhys', 'Williams', 'having', 'great', 'growth', 'course', 'episodes', 'antagonists', 'are', 'perfectly', 'love-to-hate', 'often', 'showing', 'own', 'depths', 'intricacies', 'cast', 'new', 'light', 'motivations', 'personalities', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'complimented', 'great', 'cast', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'parts', 'energy', 'emotion', 'emotion', 'here', 'would', 'not', 'exist', 'were', ""n't"", 'great', 'acting', 'likes', 'Barrowman', 'Myles', 'David-Lloyd', 'Jumbo', 'Capaldi', 'so', 'many', 'more.The', 'effects', 'series', 'Torchwood', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'high-end', 'others', 'where', 'aliens', 'were', 'more', 'seen', 'only', 'benefits', 'mysteriousness', 'alien', 'threat', 'here', 'enhanced', 'little', 'see', 'minimalistic', 'move', 'unknown', 'threat', 'much', 'scarier', 'are', 'definitely', 'moments', 'effects', 'such', 'major', 'explosion', 'early', 'arrival', 'alien', 'threat', 'are', 'still', 'kept', 'minimum', 'ground', 'action', 'improve', 'unknown', 'mysteriousness', 'antagonists', 'time', 'around', 'soundtrack', 'however', 'haunting', 'thrilling', 'providing', 'right', 'moods', 'right', 'moments.Torchwood', 'Children', 'Earth', 'doubt', 'shining', 'example', 'television', 'intelligent', 'thematic', 'emotional', 'right', 'kinds', 'thrilling', 'Everything', 'Children', 'Earth', 'excellent', 'writing', 'production', 'acting', 'Not', 'single', 'part', 'really', 'Fans', 'series', 'have', 'need', 'worry', 'change', 'direction', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'continued', 'Miracle', 'Day', 'only', 'need', 'sit', 'back', 'experience', 'ride']",Torchwood: Children of Earth
1260133,A11F5KW6QXHL8L,B002BVYBJW,Lasha,"[16, 26]","SPOILERS!!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED.I've seen Torchwood: Children of Earth and while the 5-night miniseries that aired on the BBC (and later this month on BBC America) is well worth your time if you are a die-hard Torchwood fan, I think casual viewers will be turned off by the dark tone of this series.Each one-hour episode ends with a plot twist (cliffhanger). It seems Captain Jack and Torchwood made a deal with some nasty aliens called the 456 in 1965 and that is now coming back to haunt him. The 456 are back and they are controlling the children of Earth. What do they want? They want the Earth to give up 10% of the total population of children on the planet or they will kill us all.Enter Torchwood who tries to stop them, but with a gov't hit squad after Gwen, Rhys, Jack and Ianto, will the team will able to stop the alien threat, let alone survive themselves?We also learn more about Jack's past and are given more insight into Jack and Ianto's relationship, as well as a welcome surprise for Gwen and Rhys.But the question of who lives and who dies is answered by Day 4. And a lot of die-hard TW fans were not happy with the response. i.e. A major character dies.So if you are a 'shipper in this universe, then the third season of Torchwood is not going to be pleasant for you. It's going to be painful, very painful. Which is why I suggest you don't buy the series on DVD. Rent it or download it first. See if you can deal with it, then if you truly love the plot, buy it.So while I enjoyed the overall acting, directing and quality of the Children of Earth series, because of various plot points which to me were cliched, overdramatic and unnecessary - and given the misleading advertising hype that Russell T. Davies and company put out about the series in the months prior to it airing - I cannot give it more than 2 stars.",2,Rent it first,1247184000,"07 10, 2009",2009,1863,"['SPOILERS', 'DO', 'NOT', 'READ', 'IF', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'WANT', 'TO', 'BE', 'SPOILED.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Torchwood', 'Children', 'Earth', '5-night', 'miniseries', 'aired', 'BBC', 'later', 'month', 'BBC', 'America', 'well', 'time', 'are', 'die-hard', 'Torchwood', 'fan', 'think', 'casual', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'dark', 'tone', 'series.Each', 'one-hour', 'episode', 'plot', 'twist', 'cliffhanger', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Torchwood', 'made', 'deal', 'nasty', 'aliens', 'called', '456', '1965', 'now', 'coming', 'back', 'haunt', '456', 'are', 'back', 'are', 'controlling', 'children', 'Earth', 'What', 'do', 'want', 'want', 'Earth', 'give', 'up', '10', '%', 'total', 'population', 'children', 'planet', 'will', 'kill', 'all.Enter', 'Torchwood', 'who', 'stop', ""gov't"", 'hit', 'squad', 'Gwen', 'Rhys', 'Jack', 'Ianto', 'will', 'team', 'will', 'able', 'stop', 'alien', 'threat', 'let', 'alone', 'survive', 'also', 'learn', 'more', 'Jack', 'past', 'are', 'given', 'more', 'insight', 'Jack', 'Ianto', 'relationship', 'as', 'well', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'Gwen', 'Rhys.But', 'question', 'who', 'lives', 'who', 'answered', 'Day', '4', 'lot', 'die-hard', 'TW', 'fans', 'were', 'not', 'happy', 'response', 'i.e', 'major', 'character', 'dies.So', 'are', ""'shipper"", 'universe', 'then', 'third', 'season', 'Torchwood', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'pleasant', 'going', 'be', 'painful', 'very', 'painful', 'Which', 'why', 'suggest', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'series', 'DVD', 'Rent', 'download', 'first', 'See', 'can', 'deal', 'then', 'truly', 'love', 'plot', 'buy', 'enjoyed', 'overall', 'acting', 'directing', 'quality', 'Children', 'Earth', 'series', 'various', 'plot', 'points', 'were', 'cliched', 'overdramatic', 'unnecessary', 'given', 'misleading', 'advertising', 'hype', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'company', 'put', 'out', 'series', 'months', 'prior', 'airing', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'more', '2', 'stars']",Torchwood: Children of Earth

The silliness is dropped and what you have is no less than what the fourth series installment of Quatermass,(1972), should've been.Nigel Kneale, who adapted George Orwell's 1984 for the radio in the early 1950s went to BBC television and created the character of Bernard Quatermass for three television series each of six one-hour installments. You may not know it, but these not only invented science fiction for British TV and film, but they are the source for much science fiction to come. You probably have seen one of the Hammer films made from these three series. Most famous is ""Quatermass and the Pit"" released in the United States as ""5 million years to Earth"".More pertinent here is the 1984 theme of his second TV series called ""Quatermass II"", called ""Enemy From Space"" in the US. Here we have the theme of the government being taken over by an agenda at odds with the freedom and prosperity of the people that live under it. This is why consider ""Children of the Earth"" to be the suitable successor to the political and ethical questions coming out of the book 1984 as being thought through by the Socialist critique of the Quatermass universe.There are several plot conceits that don't really work at all in the action surrounding the central core of the movie in London. One escape scene seen something like you would see in Mission impossible but it passes quickly. The acting level and the script of what goes on in the inner circles of London politics is like the very best of the socially aware movies of the 1970s, (""All the President's Men"") or British drama, (the John le Carr&eacute; espionage adaptations like 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"").This is a film ALL Neo-Liberal Governments would rather you don't see.",5,"5 Stars: Torchwood ""Children of Earth"" Inherits the mantle of Quatermass",1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,1950,"['Just', 'Torchwood', 'branch', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'series', 'third', 'season', 'Torchwood', 'reality', 'five', 'night', 'miniseries', 'branch', 'Torchwood', 'called', 'collectively', 'Children', 'Earth', 'silliness', 'dropped', 'what', 'have', 'less', 'what', 'fourth', 'series', 'installment', 'Quatermass', '1972', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been.Nigel', 'Kneale', 'who', 'adapted', 'George', 'Orwell', '1984', 'radio', 'early', '1950s', 'went', 'BBC', 'television', 'created', 'character', 'Bernard', 'Quatermass', 'three', 'television', 'series', 'six', 'one-hour', 'installments', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'not', 'only', 'invented', 'science', 'fiction', 'British', 'TV', 'film', 'are', 'source', 'much', 'science', 'fiction', 'come', 'probably', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'Hammer', 'films', 'made', 'three', 'series', 'Most', 'famous', 'Quatermass', 'Pit', 'released', 'United', 'States', '5', 'million', 'years', 'Earth', 'pertinent', 'here', '1984', 'theme', 'second', 'TV', 'series', 'called', 'Quatermass', 'II', 'called', 'Enemy', 'From', 'Space', 'US', 'Here', 'have', 'theme', 'government', 'being', 'taken', 'over', 'agenda', 'odds', 'freedom', 'prosperity', 'people', 'live', 'why', 'consider', 'Children', 'Earth', 'be', 'suitable', 'successor', 'political', 'ethical', 'questions', 'coming', 'book', '1984', 'being', 'thought', 'Socialist', 'critique', 'Quatermass', 'are', 'several', 'plot', 'conceits', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'action', 'surrounding', 'central', 'core', 'movie', 'London', 'One', 'escape', 'scene', 'seen', 'something', 'would', 'see', 'Mission', 'impossible', 'quickly', 'acting', 'level', 'script', 'what', 'inner', 'circles', 'London', 'politics', 'very', 'best', 'socially', 'aware', 'movies', '1970s', 'President', 'Men', 'British', 'drama', 'John', 'le', 'Carr', 'eacute', 'adaptations', ""'Tinker"", 'Tailor', 'Soldier', 'Spy', '.This', 'film', 'Neo-Liberal', 'Governments', 'would', 'rather', 'do', ""n't"", 'see']",Torchwood: Children of Earth

Well worth watching.I tend to prefer a TV series that is really a series - a story that spans episodes, and only makes sense when you watch them in order.  The first two seasons had stories that could be played in any order, except that some earlier stories were picked up in later episodes, such as a girl who died in episode 1 to return later, and in character development.Well, in Season 3, a.k.a. Children of Earth, the Torchwood writers got to stretch out and write a story that spans five episodes.  The story is far more complex, more dark, more amazing, and more exciting than anything of the first two seasons.  And that's saying something!It's hard to say much about it without getting into spoilers.  Like many of the first two seasons, aliens are involved.  These aliens are a bit more demanding.  There are dark secrets of the past, for Jack, for the government.  The story gets darker, and darker, and darker.  Shocking!  By the middle of the final episode, I was really wondering how they would wind it all up.  But they did, and in a satisfying and reasonably natural fashion.One important difference is that sex is really not much part of the story this time.  Considering how much it was part of the first two seasons, that's a real departure.  But the pace of this adventure is such that there really was not time for such things.  Except for the RESULTS of sex, I mean: Gwen is pregnant.

Sure I like the old premise better but the story still is part of torchwood and we are stuck with it. I won't go into it other than to say it concerns aliens of course and bad government people.

Small seasons and often short runs. ALthough some shows over there lasted many years , the bill just ended after at 28 yars or so. I would say that if you can let go of the past series then you will find this at least interesting and the effects are top notch as well. However this is the most depressing Torchwood series  yet.

Then I hit Season 3 and was utterly completely mesmerized and amazed.  Children of Earth is incredible.  Normally I am not a fan of emotionally dark or depressing plots as I have a difficult time shaking them off and I usually regret a decision to watch something that I'm reasonably certain will make me depressed or weepy.  Thus, I will never watch Marley and Me or Tuesdays with Morrie or any of those other horrible things that are designed to make you cry like a kid who got punched in the gut.  BUT, this series is well worth the emotional punch in the gut.The story is a new enough twist on older themes to feel fresh and tightly woven.  There are the old moral dilemmas of: 1) do the ends justify the means; 2) what is the value of a single life; 3) is it okay to sacrifice some for the good of many; 4) just following orders; etc.  These are mixed in with other old issues such as class warfare, the grubby disgustingness of politics and what one becomes when one is more concerned about covering one's ass more than anything else.The tension continues to build and build while cruising through entire ranges of emotion, and it's paced well to keep you hanging throughout the series as well as throughout each episode.  The story is full.  I think that's the best word to describe it.  There's so much packed into the series in terms of how it plays with your heart and mind.  Even after watching it, your head and heart will keep running through the story to go over this bit and that bit that you were unable to fully process while in the grip of watching it through.The storyline starts off with a small mystery which increases in intensity from odd (huh why are these kids freezing?) to creepy (children should never do anything in unison because it's creepy but I admit this is a fear I've had since reading A Wrinkle in Time) to frightening (vague threats of a coming visit) to mad panic horror (dear god they're doing WHAT with the children?? Must rewind to make sure I actually saw what I think I saw) -- and that's just from viewing the aliens' actions.  The plot then turns to viewing the actions of humans to the situation and a whole new level of emotional turmoil develops from disapproving disgust to vomit-inducing repulsion.  To complete the emotional roller coaster, the story is sad throughout because there aren't any easy answers.BUT, this is well worth viewing because you won't be able to get the images or plot out of your mind and it'll keep you turning round and round to think over things.  It's satisfying because it's an interesting story that's developed well visually and by the pace of the plot with enough substance and emotional tuning to make you feel full and satisfied but you're left still wanting more more more...

They are very much the same characters and we are allowed to get even closer to them, especially Capt. Jack.  And comments that it was darker than the others weren't watching the same season 2 I was.Each episode was tense and built on to the next.  The last episode was painful to watch with our heroes unable to move freely about to do their work, and the governments total lack of regard for the children of the world, but ultimately they do save the day.  I didn't find Jack's stand from day 4 to day 5 about the loss of life a contradiction, I think it had more to do with the few for the many and there wasn't any way to avoid that.  I think the end is more about why he was chosen 40 years ago and how much he has changed since then.  He may have made the same decision, but lost everything in the process.  And he did see is grandson, just not as often as he would like, so he did have a relationship with him.  On a side note, it was nice that they didn't kill, stab or shoot Rhys.The acting was brilliant.

Any character can (and will die) through the stories. This is good as its keeps you guessing. Its not like a US show where every week the heroes solve the mystery and there is little reality in what can happen. This show is nothing like that and that is part of what makes it good.Season One you see the characters, learn what they are doing and why, some of their backgrounds and how they became involved. Several tie-ins with the Doctor Who series. Full seasons/series.Season Two continues the adventures and things start to change and get interesting along character development and you are pulled into the series further. Only down side, some of the adult themes just get old due to the numerous repetitions (Jack and his boyfriends mostly). The rest of it though makes up for it and keeps you coming back for more. Half a normal season/series number of episodes.Season Three (Children of Earth): First off, when this first was advertised, it looked like a 5 day special launch to season three and looked like it was going to be a GREAT start. The let down here is the 5 episodes are season 3 in its entirety. The story is still very good, everything does change. It leaves a huge cliffhanger and rather upset you have to wait forever for Season 4 to be made. 5 episodesBBC: PLEASE do a cranialanalectomy (removal of your collective heads from your ass) and stop screwing around with this series.

Davies, finally can write his own work and not be derivative.  True, Torchwood is technically a ""Spin-Off"" of ""Doctor Who""... but with this mini-series event, he has proven that he can write a story that can show the true human spirit with the minimum of ""gimmicks"".  True there was an ""Alien"" in this series.  There were characters that were introduced to us in ""Doctor Who"" and on the first two seasons of ""Torchwood"", but this moves away from the ""monster of the week"" sort of show that the first two seasons of ""Torchwood"" on BBC became (a poor attempt at an ""adult program for fans of Doctor Who"").  This instead was pure high quality adult science fiction, that shows the human failings, without having to use ""aliens and special effects"" for a ""crutch"".  We can see how our governments are all too ready to ""give in"" what is of most value, when we are put against ""overwhelming odds"".  We can see where sacrifice can be too high of a price, when it is something we most value.  Numbers are irrelevant, when it comes to what we hold most dear.  What price is too high to ""save our skins"" from what may be seen as ""total destruction"".  During World War I and World War II, especially, we saw how we had a choice to either allow a strong enemy overwhelm us... or we could fight and not surrender for the values that mean the most to us.This again is not the ""monster of the week"".  It does not have some ""space alien"" from Galifrey, coming to save our poor defenseless human behinds because we are so weak that we can not do anything for ourselves.  We can see where our worst enemy at times is ourselves, and it takes the courage of the average human being to FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL.  Even if it means that we might lose everything.  In World War I and in World War II, our fathers gave EVERYTHING in order to give this world safety and peace, even if it meant their own lives.  In more recent moments of war, our brothers have given EVERYTHING to give this world some safety and peace in this world of terrorism, where we do not have a clearly defined enemy on a map.  If anything, the wars we see in our world today are more a fight against ""aliens"" than any wars we have had in the past.Are we willing to give up our souls, just for the chance of having a few more days to breathe on this planet?  Or are we willing to fight the good fight, even if it means we can have a chance to lose anything.I have read many reviews on this particular mini-series, and on theTorchwood: The Complete Original UK Serieswhich includes this mini-series complain about it.  About its strong ""American Influences"" (and that of the new Starz US Version of Torchwood... ""Torchwood: Miracle Day"").  But those who complain must be the British who are trying to compare the ORIGINAL ""Doctor Who"" with the ""Russell T. Davies Doctor Who"" which is a very Welsh production and especially ""Torchwood"" while technically a ""spin-off"" of the ""Russell T. Davies Doctor Who"" (but not really a spin-off of the ORIGINAL ""Doctor Who"")... and realize that this is a very well made Welsh drama series, that is trying to still feed those who love the classic Science Fiction of someone of the quality of a C.S. Lewis, H.G. Welles, Ray Bradbury, or Issac Asimov... which are ""less monsters"" and more ""science"" in their ""fiction""... then you might be able to see the difference.""Torchwood"" was never meant to be aimed at the ""Doctor Who"" demographic, for the ""very young to the very old"".  ""Torchwood"", deals with a lot more ""adult issues"" that are more typical of the previous work of Russell T. Davies.  If anything ""Doctor Who"" is the ONE SERIES that does not really fit in the resume of Russell T. Davies, who is mostly a writer and producer of adult orientated programing (not talking pornography here by any means, I am talking about adult issues including more ""regular violence"" than ""fantasy violence"", more ""sexuality"" than is normal for ""prime time programming"", things that would not ""float"" on Network Television in the United States).  On the BBC, much more profanity and sexuality is ""okay"" for a ""prime time audience"" (being allowed on the publicly paid for via television receiver license fees channels of the British Broadcasting Network, with minimal complaints on Ofcom in the UK which handles the FCC type complaints we have in the US).  Here in the US, such programming would not be allowed on ""Over the Air"" broadcasts during ""prime time"" due to the very ""Adult Nature"" of even Seasons 1 and 2 of ""Torchwood"" (and ""Doctor Who"" is still a ""Kiddie Show"" compared to ""Torchwood"" even under the control of Mr. Davies).So if you have been a fan of the work of Russell T. Davies, between 1994 and 2004 (after he first started in television in ""children's programming"" moved into ""Adult Programming"" for that decade, then even with his ""coming out of the closet"" in such a BIG WAY (as his adult programming shows), being allowed by the BBC to take over their ""Gold Standard"" franchise of ""Doctor Who""... then you should have known what to expect.  He moved out of the ""day to day"" operations of ""Doctor Who"" because he wanted to go back into more ""Adult Orientated Drama"" (designed for a demographic of those who have graduated high school and beyond), which he has done with ""Torchwood"".  With this mini-series he finally fine tuned what he needed to do to create great adult science fiction (without needing a ""blue box"", a ""sonic screwdriver"", an ""alien of the week"", or even with an ""alien"" being the ""main star"").  Unlike ""Doctor Who"" who has a ""lead character"" in ""The Doctor"", ""Torchwood"" had always been an ensemble cast, that has made it such a strong drama.  It took a couple of years for it to fully ""break off"" from the ""crutch"" of ""Doctor Who""... but now it is becoming a great drama.If you want to blame how ""bad"" this mini-series is, or praise how ""good"" this mini series is... you must lie it entirely at the FEET of Russell T. Davies.  After all he is the one who CREATED ""Torchwood"", and ""Torchwood: Children of Earth"" was ENTIRELY HIS STORY, and he shares the writing credits on the scripts for the mini-series, but the story is entirely his.  From the first word to the closing line.  So if you do not like how ""Torchwood"" had advanced, the blame goes squarely on its creator and main writer.  After all, it is a Welsh drama series created by a Welshman for an adult audience.",5,Finally Russell T.

1260179,A3SQV69Q3F8FU9,B002BVYBJW,rgregg,"[11, 17]","Obviously this series has people divided. One of the things that British television does is have no fear about killing off characters (See MI-5 or Primeval) and do it with emotion and drama.Anyone who has followed the adventures of Captain Jack Harkness and his Torchwood compatriots know some of the drama and tragedy that has affected these characters in past seasons. This short but powerful Season 3 opens with Jack, Ianto and Gwen still mourning the loss of their friends and quickly evolves into a superb science fiction tale involving all of the children on earth reacting in similar fashion which creates havoc and concern on the planet. From here, it involves politics, good and evil, high drama, alien invasion, deep sadness, stunning revelations into the background of Captain Jack that have profound impact on the storyline, moments of sheer terror and surprising turns of event. In this 5 hours, I found myself on the edge of my seat many times and also ended up with tears in my eyes more than once. It takes a while to figure out why the children are reacting the way they are, what the alien's intent is and it is not a pretty tale. But no one can deny the powerful writing and execution. So, if you are looking for easy solutions and typical happy endings, then you may want to avoid ""Torchwood:Children of Earth"". But if you want to watch one of the most compelling miniseries ever produced, then settle in, pay attention and be prepared to be shocked and captivated. Intelligent television at it's very best. Knowing just a bit about the background of the Torchwood gang is helpful but not necessary to appreciate this wonderful show.

1260182,A16QODENBJVUI1,B002BVYBJW,Robert Moore,"[6, 10]","I only recently made the decision to catch up on the new Doctor Who and its spin off Torchwood.  It has been quite an experience to say the least.  Neither show is particularly consistent, both of them having some really weak moments and some absolutely extraordinary ones.  Each show can at its worst be banal and more than a little dull.  Each can descend into boring chat.  But at their best they can both be amazing.  I was absolutely blown away by the two amazing Doctor Who episodes ""Blink"" and ""Midnight,"" which represents TV at its best.  And I was simply flabbergasted at how astonishing how exciting and fresh this show was.  And so dark!  The only good SF show I know that has gone as dark as Children of Earth is BSG. But there we were talking about an earthlike civilization, not earth itself.  The conceit of the governments of earth doing the things contained in this miniseries (which is essentially what it is) is a gut wrenching one.If you have heard good things about this TV event (and if you love great TV just ignore the negative reviews here -- a huge number of church groups target this show because the lead character is gay, so a lot of those giving it negative reviews have an agenda) do yourself a favor and see it.  Now!  Don't bother to see Seasons One and Two.  They aren't necessary.  I'll give you here all you need to know.  Torchwood is a secret organization in Great Britain outside government control that was founded by Queen Victoria after she encountered the Doctor (as in Doctor Who).  Terrified of the presence of alien life in the universe, she wanted England to be prepared to fight back.  Contemporary Torchwood is headed by Captain Jack Harkness, who is a former 51st century Time Agent who (in events covered in an episode of Doctor Who -- Jack was briefly a traveling companion of the Doctor, and has appeared on the show several times as a guest star) has lost the ability to die.  Like Wolverine in the X-Men, he can heal from any wound, regardless of how extreme it is.  And that is really all you need to know.  Obviously, knowing the previous two seasons and Doctor Who would help, but it isn't necessary.  Just dive in!  But you will definitely want to go back and catch up on both shows.I don't really want to go into details because I really think that Children of Earth should be seen with the viewer knowing as little as possible.  But I promise you that you will be astonished.If you are homophobic, do yourself a favor and skip the show.  As I mentioned above, Captain Jack Harkness has relationships with men (and women).When this series ended, the future of Torchwood was uncertain.  Although Children of Earth was a miniseries, some have counted it as technically being Season Three.  There had been no announcement for a Season Four.  But in the past couple of weeks it has been announced that Russell T. Davies (the creator of Torchwood and the man responsible for relaunching Doctor Who) had agreed to do a joint venture with Starz that will bring Captain Jack and Gwen back to protecting the world from alien invasions.  It isn't clear yet where it will be set (Torchwood was set previously in Cardiff because of a supposed time rift there, which made it a lure for alien activity, a feature I strongly suspect was borrowed from the Hellmouth in Sunnydale luring vampires and demons there on BUFFY).  There will be new cast members and a more international tone to the show.

1260184,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B002BVYBJW,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 8]","Over the course of five episodes, the surviving members of Torchwood, Cardiff battle both an alien menace and their own government to save...The Children of Earth.Beginning decades earlier, a small group of children is bussed to a remote location in the hills.  Herded by soldiers to aliens, one of the children escapes.  Two facts are immediately suggested to Torchwood fans.  First, the fugitive child has escaped nothing, and will be shown holding out in the slimmest form of asylum.  Second, one of the uniformed men is our own Captain Jack Harkness - a bid for King and Country that will not be counted among his finest hours.Years later, John Frobisher, a thoroughly British bureaucratic fixture of the Home Office, is called upon to shoulder an enormous burden - brokering an accord with the reappearing aliens.  The beings - who announce their arrival through the minds and mouths of children around the world - are known only as the ""4-5-6"".  Their motives not immediately publicized, it's difficult to avoid signs of nefarious intent.  (On arrival, the 4-5-6 ambassador occupies a gas-filled bubble, in which he occasionally lashes out like some angry parakeet.)  Eventually, 456 will deal to the world governments an especially painful and inescapable dilemma, a choice humanity dare not refuse.  Rather than involve Torchwood, the governments prefer to eliminate it, and the individual members, beginning with Captain Jack himself.""tell the indestructible man that someone plans to murder him.""Torchwood has always been a study in opposites, a pack of contradictions (fleshy characters, thin stories; great plot ideas, horrible realization; alternating between being genuinely adult and simply being childish and playing grown-up) and CoE is no exception.(But we of the RottenReview love, so we'll start off w/the weaknesses of the story and finish on a high).""Torchwood"" forces us to accept both a moral issue and a sci-fi plot, but not at the same time.  That is, our characters must face a horrible dilemma...but only until a sci-fi plot idea allows them an escape (admittedly a painful one - but still a smaller sacrifice than the one they had been facing anyway).  The ending feels forced and undermines the horrible fate that hung over the previous four episodes.  ""Torchwood"" always falls before the pay-off, and CoE is no exception.WEY YOU MUST WATCH IT:  After three seasons of aliens, gunfire, death and same-sex lip-lock, ""Torchwood"" comes as close as ever to being a genuinely mature show.

1260186,AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,B002BVYBJW,"Scot Merideth Peirson ""Scot Peirson""","[5, 9]","The more that I looked at Series 2 of ""Torchwood"", the more I had a suspicion...that Russell T. Davies and Julie Gardner weren't happy with the personnel mix that they had.  This isn't a put-down to Nakano Mori, Burn Gorman, and especially Gareth Lloyd-Davies...but in rewatching Series 2, I just suspected that the two showrunners weren't happy with something the way the story flowed in the second series--which led to the deaths of Owen Harper and Toshiko Sato at the end of Series Two, and the controversial ending of the Ianto Jones storyline in ""Children Of Earth"".Still, this is NOT a bad story; in many ways it is very consistent with the darker and more viseral tone--as I call it, ""The Broken Reflection of the Whoniverse""--that the series had maintained since its beginning.  It opens up a few surprises--with John Barrowman's Jack Harkness not just being a father, but a grandfather; but also a deal that Captain Jack brokered in the 1960s coming back to haunt him...and the planet.  The explanation of the 456, and what they want with 10% of the Earth's children...is harrowing.  Of course, the story gets complicated by Jack, Gwen Cooper and Ianto (As well as Rhys Williams, Gwen's husband) becoming outlaws to the British Home Office.  Our three main leads--Barrowman, Eve Myles, and Lloyd-Davies--are in fine form as the team working to save the planet in a situation where some within the British government seem more determined to appease rather than combat.  Which leaves an undermanned Torchwood to the fight...and certainly not an easy fight, given what the final victory over the 456 costs Harkness.Barrowman, Eve Myles, Lloyd-Davies and Kai Owen are all in a good place, with Owen giving Rhys Williams a little more life and the ability to think on his feet.  Lucy Cohu's Alice Carter--Harkness' daughter--and Bear McCausland--Jack's grandson--are interesting introductions...and given how the storyline played out--and the nature of the Whoniverse--we can't clearly say that the ending we saw WAS THE END...Liz May Brice's Agent Johnson was also an interesting introduction that might be recurring when ""Torchwood"" gets back on screen in 2011...But overall, the whole of this story--while being very good--still has the feel of Davies and Gardner reworking the team toward possibly becoming the home for people who have had dealings with The Doctor.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing--Whovians are comfortable with Freema Agyeman's Martha Smith-Jones (If ""Law And Order:UK"" doesn't work out) and Noel Clarke's Mickey Smith...and Torchwood could use a secretarial-type...do I hear a vote for a certain loud and brassy redhead with some memory issues...like a Donna Noble?Time will tell where Russell and Julie will take Torchwood at the beginning of next year.

Rickles,"[9, 16]","I hope that as readers of this review, you'll allow me to associate its ideas with those on this site offered by  michelle ""mmdragondreamer"" and B. Starbuck (Autumwytch). Having just viewed ""Torchwood: Children of Earth"" I believe this to be science fiction at its darkest and yet most meaningful.  In this 3rd series, Torchwood's hub has been destroyed, and its team has become the focus of a government man-hunt and conspiracy cover-up.  Driven underground the Torchwood team has been effectively neutralized, hampered in their ability to understand or help with an alien encounter that has its historical origins in 1965. SF connosieurs may criticize the alien ""456"" for seeming to be vague in their origins, nature and abilities, but in this series, from a literary standpoint - they need to be - because the story is less about them -- and more about us. To put it another way, when Queen Victoria would have established the Torchwood Institute in 1879 to defend the British Realm against non-human outsiders, it's hardly likely that she would have forseen Torchwood's earnest efforts coming under such virulent attack from within the government itself.  The decisions that Captain Jack must make are horrible, and viewers may well question if perhaps he'd had more time to analyze the olfactory elements of 456's presence, or the hormone variances between youth and adulthood - perhaps he may have come to a better --less reprehensible solution - than he resorted to at the series end.  We don't know -- and perhaps that's the point.  The men and women of the Manhattan Project were given limited time, and like Frobisher, they were likely under pressure believing that the bomb represented the only solution to the challenges of World War II.  Perhaps it was the only solution.  But here at the series end is Captain Jack Harkness, who is still trying to kick the dirt off his shoes even six months after the events of ""Children of Earth"".  Like him, we too now live in a forever changed world. YES!

Not so many special features on this set. I'm giving it 5 stars because it kept me entertained, the box is nice, and I thoroughly enjoyed Ianto, Gwen, and Rhys. I watched all of Torchwood in a few weeks so I may have a better opinion of it than people who watched it as it aired. I do understand their issues with it.Here's where the spoilers come in so stop reading if you want to remain oblivious. This is the first set I began watching where I felt like I actually really liked Gwen. I never disliked her, it just took more time for me to appreciate her character. Ianto was still my favorite. Jack doesn't quite seem like the Jack I'd come to know in the first 2 seasons or in Doctor Who. But I overlooked this because Gwen and Ianto were still cool. I could deal with the demented premise and all of the ridiculousness. What bothers me is episode 4, Ianto dies. I went into Torchwood knowing Ianto, Tosh, and Owen, do not survive the series. When Tosh and Owen died it was sad but it made sense in the context of the story. You could deal with it, they died fighting. Ianto's death was unnecessary. It's like they threw it in there merely for shock value. And he dies because of a poisonous gas? Really?! It was sudden, uncalled for and ridiculous.

Jack or the actor who plays him.So, if, like me, the idea of Dr. Who is unappealing, try season 3 of Torchwood -- you may want to watch a bit of Season 1, tho, just to get the idea straight first.",5,Who is Dr. Who?,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,936,"['Most', 'who', 'rated', 'Season', '3', 'Torchwood', 'poorly', 'are', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'am', 'not', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'not', 'watched', 'one', 'episode', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'will', 'ever', 'campy', 'silly', 'ironic', 'adolescent', 'sci', 'fi', '/', 'fantasy', 'not', 'thingie', 'are', 'comic', 'books', 'action', 'figures', 'movies', 'where', 'special', 'effects', 'trump', 'character', 'plot', '.However', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'Torchwood', 'go', 'had', 'run', 'things', 'watch', 'kind', 'liked', 'season', 'one', 'episodes', 'i', 'thought', 'exceptional', 'Then', 'accidentally', 'skipped', 'Season', '2', 'watched', 'Season', '3', 'next', 'was', 'riveted', 'totally', 'engaged', 'Wow', 'Excellent', 'story', 'lots', 'tension', 'pathos', 'lot', 'Went', 'back', 'Season', '2', 'have', 'given', 'series', 'up', '4', 'episodes', 'want', 'kill', 'Capt', 'Jack', 'actor', 'who', 'him.So', 'idea', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'unappealing', 'try', 'season', '3', 'Torchwood', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'bit', 'Season', '1', 'tho', 'just', 'get', 'idea', 'straight', 'first']",Torchwood: Children of Earth

Chan,"[13, 25]","When watching this 5 part miniseries on BBC America this past week, I have to say that the first 3 Days out of 5 were intriguing, despite the plot holes and uncharacteristic stupidity.  (One thing that bugs me the most is when my beloved characters do stupid things or do things that they normally won't do.)  The concept was interesting, but then Day 4 came.  And what I knew to be Torchwood was stomped by a giant boot of an ego named Russell T. Davies.  From Day 4 onward, nothing made sense in the Torchwood universe.  The stupidity factor went through the roof.  I only watched Day 5 to see if all the crap was indeed a dream sequence or a cruel joke.  I was desperate to make some sense of the catastrophe that is Children of Earth.Basically, what happened was Mr. Davies decided to destroy everything he built over two years in the series Torchwood.  The fans did not matter, the characters did not matter, a logical plot did not matter.  The political MESSAGE that Mr. Davies wanted to say was the only thing that mattered. As another reviewer has already mentioned, Mr. Davies doesn't care what his fans think.  In fact, he mocks them.So if you are a fan of Torchwood, prepare to say your goodbyes to this great series.  If you are a Sci Fi fan, Children of Earth is like Alien 3, which we all pretend didn't happen.  If you are neither a Torchwood fan nor a Sci Fi fan, then I would liken Children of Earth to watching your house burn down with everything you love in it.",1,Utter Failure - Tochwood Fans Beware!,1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,1481,"['When', 'watching', '5', 'part', 'miniseries', 'BBC', 'America', 'past', 'week', 'have', 'say', 'first', '3', 'Days', '5', 'were', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'holes', 'uncharacteristic', 'stupidity', 'One', 'thing', 'most', 'when', 'beloved', 'characters', 'do', 'stupid', 'things', 'do', 'things', 'normally', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'concept', 'was', 'interesting', 'then', 'Day', '4', 'came', 'what', 'knew', 'be', 'Torchwood', 'was', 'stomped', 'giant', 'boot', 'ego', 'named', 'Russell', 'T.', 'Davies', 'From', 'Day', '4', 'onward', 'nothing', 'made', 'sense', 'Torchwood', 'universe', 'stupidity', 'factor', 'went', 'roof', 'only', 'watched', 'Day', '5', 'see', 'crap', 'was', 'indeed', 'dream', 'sequence', 'cruel', 'joke', 'was', 'desperate', 'make', 'sense', 'catastrophe', 'Children', 'Earth.Basically', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Davies', 'decided', 'destroy', 'everything', 'built', 'two', 'years', 'series', 'Torchwood', 'fans', 'did', 'not', 'matter', 'characters', 'did', 'not', 'matter', 'logical', 'plot', 'did', 'not', 'matter', 'political', 'MESSAGE', 'Mr.', 'Davies', 'wanted', 'say', 'was', 'only', 'thing', 'mattered', 'reviewer', 'already', 'mentioned', 'Mr.', 'Davies', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'fans', 'think', 'fact', 'them.So', 'are', 'fan', 'Torchwood', 'prepare', 'say', 'goodbyes', 'great', 'series', 'are', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'fan', 'Children', 'Earth', 'Alien', '3', 'pretend', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'are', 'neither', 'Torchwood', 'fan', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'fan', 'then', 'would', 'liken', 'Children', 'Earth', 'watching', 'house', 'burn', 'down', 'everything', 'love']",Torchwood: Children of Earth

The Torchwood show is a spin-off from the relaunched Doctor Who series, and while watching the Doctor Who series adds depth to Torchwood, it is not completely necessary.This third season is only 5 episodes, but that seems to be about as long as it needs to be--the story arc is neatly contained, it seldom seems to drag, and it definitely ramps up the intensity with taut writing and shocking plot twists.  If you are coming to ""Children of Earth"" fresh off the end of Season Two, chances are you're still reeling from shock.  Our story opens with important main characters already dead, and the survivors are thrust into a taut invasion story that leaves everything--including the future of the human race--in doubt.  This wild ride may run fast, but it doesn't skim the surface:  at times it runs quite deep.  One of the recurring moral themes in ""Children of Earth"" is, ""What would you do to save the world?  How far is too far?""  You find yourself wondering if there are any surefire answers, and the writers do their best to change the game on you as Children of Earth goes along, each time putting the morality in a different light and making you wonder again.I've just finished watching this DVD set and I have to say I was floored.  It was brilliantly written, but it's also hard to take, probably most of all because you can see the events that happen actually taking place if this were a true story.  You can definitely see people behaving the way that they do, and you find yourself a bit overwhelmed at human nature.  That said, nothing else is missing from this series:  we have good costumes, fascinating sets, camera work that takes color and light into dramatic effect, and of course special effects that border on theatrical.  Story and dialogue are well played, and the DVD mastery scales decently to larger resolutions:  not eye-popping when upscaled, but neither is it muddied and badly colored.If you're new to Torchwood, you should try to watch Season Two first, particularly its last half and finale.  If you're a fan of Torchwood and haven't seen this installment yet, try to set aside a large block of time because you're going to have a hard time putting it down between episodes.",5,Stunning and Scary,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,2382,"[""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Torchwood', 'series', 'really', 'need', 'have', 'seen', 'episodes', 'leading', 'up', 'point', 'order', 'truly', 'understand', 'Children', 'Earth', 'Torchwood', 'show', 'spin-off', 'relaunched', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'watching', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'series', 'depth', 'Torchwood', 'not', 'completely', 'necessary.This', 'third', 'season', 'only', '5', 'episodes', 'be', 'about', 'as', 'long', 'be', 'story', 'arc', 'neatly', 'contained', 'seldom', 'drag', 'definitely', 'up', 'intensity', 'taut', 'writing', 'shocking', 'plot', 'twists', 'are', 'coming', 'Children', 'Earth', 'fresh', 'end', 'Season', 'Two', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'still', 'reeling', 'shock', 'story', 'important', 'main', 'characters', 'already', 'dead', 'survivors', 'are', 'thrust', 'taut', 'invasion', 'story', 'everything', 'including', 'future', 'human', 'race', 'doubt', 'wild', 'ride', 'may', 'run', 'fast', ""n't"", 'skim', 'surface', 'times', 'quite', 'deep', 'One', 'recurring', 'moral', 'themes', 'Children', 'Earth', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'save', 'world', 'How', 'far', 'too', 'far', 'find', 'wondering', 'are', 'surefire', 'answers', 'writers', 'do', 'best', 'change', 'game', 'Children', 'Earth', 'along', 'time', 'putting', 'morality', 'different', 'light', 'making', 'wonder', 'again.I', ""'ve"", 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'DVD', 'set', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'floored', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'also', 'hard', 'take', 'probably', 'most', 'can', 'see', 'events', 'happen', 'actually', 'taking', 'place', 'were', 'true', 'story', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'people', 'behaving', 'way', 'do', 'find', 'bit', 'overwhelmed', 'human', 'nature', 'said', 'nothing', 'else', 'missing', 'series', 'have', 'good', 'costumes', 'fascinating', 'sets', 'camera', 'work', 'color', 'light', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'course', 'special', 'effects', 'border', 'theatrical', 'Story', 'dialogue', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'DVD', 'mastery', 'decently', 'larger', 'resolutions', 'not', 'eye-popping', 'when', 'upscaled', 'muddied', 'badly', 'colored.If', ""'re"", 'new', 'Torchwood', 'should', 'try', 'watch', 'Season', 'Two', 'first', 'particularly', 'last', 'half', 'finale', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Torchwood', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'installment', 'yet', 'try', 'set', 'aside', 'large', 'block', 'time', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'putting', 'down', 'episodes']",Torchwood: Children of Earth
