1396728,A2N1GYD8Y22WG8,B004D9FLJY,"J. Schmidt ""Classics Caper""","[66, 103]","With this DVD release, FOX has clearly demonstrated that they are going to milk the cash cow that is Glee for all its worth. In case you're wondering what exactly this latest Glee DVD entails, it is essentially a collection of 30 or so Glee musical numbers. It is important to note that none of these numbers are extended, nor have they been specially released just for this DVD. The fact is, that ALL these musical numbers are from the first season, and if you own the first season on DVD or Blu-ray, you already have these numbers to watch. I am curious as to whom this product is aimed, people who don't watch the show or own the first season, or perhaps diehard fans who would just like the convenience of having all their favorite Glee musical numbers offered in one place without having to skip through their DVD season 1 set? Either way, this set brings nothing new to the table. So, unless you have never seen the show and want to use this as a mildly affordable introduction to it or maybe if you are having a ""Glee Party"" and want this playing in the background, I would recommend against purchasing this product as the average Glee fan and Amazon shopper most likely will already have access to this hodge-podge of Glee musical numbers. The DVD is entitled ""Encore,"" and an encore is by definition more of the same, however encores typically do not cost extra and are simply a free added bonus to a program. A true encore would have been included as a bonus disc with the first season release. So with this ""encore,"" it will be up to individual Glee fans to decide whether its worth it to pay for something they already own.",2,Nothing You Haven't Already Seen,1299110400,"03 3, 2011",2011,1635,"['DVD', 'release', 'FOX', 'clearly', 'demonstrated', 'are', 'going', 'milk', 'cash', 'cow', 'Glee', 'worth', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'what', 'exactly', 'latest', 'Glee', 'DVD', 'essentially', 'collection', '30', 'so', 'Glee', 'musical', 'numbers', 'important', 'note', 'none', 'numbers', 'are', 'extended', 'have', 'been', 'specially', 'released', 'just', 'DVD', 'fact', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'first', 'season', 'own', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'already', 'have', 'numbers', 'watch', 'am', 'curious', 'whom', 'product', 'aimed', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'own', 'first', 'season', 'perhaps', 'diehard', 'fans', 'who', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'convenience', 'having', 'favorite', 'Glee', 'musical', 'numbers', 'offered', 'one', 'place', 'having', 'skip', 'DVD', 'season', '1', 'set', 'way', 'set', 'nothing', 'new', 'table', 'So', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'want', 'use', 'mildly', 'affordable', 'introduction', 'maybe', 'are', 'having', 'Glee', 'Party', 'want', 'playing', 'background', 'would', 'recommend', 'purchasing', 'product', 'average', 'Glee', 'fan', 'Amazon', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'already', 'have', 'access', 'hodge-podge', 'Glee', 'musical', 'numbers', 'DVD', 'entitled', 'Encore', 'encore', 'definition', 'more', 'same', 'however', 'typically', 'do', 'not', 'cost', 'extra', 'are', 'simply', 'free', 'added', 'bonus', 'program', 'true', 'encore', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'bonus', 'disc', 'first', 'season', 'release', 'So', 'encore', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'individual', 'Glee', 'fans', 'decide', 'worth', 'pay', 'something', 'already', 'own']",Glee Encore

1396731,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004D9FLJY,Mark Turner,"[2, 4]","So everywhere I turn I keep hearing about how great a TV series GLEE is. My sister and her family are GLEE addicts. There are magazines, games, buttons and more adorned with the GLEE logo and actors. So what makes it so special? My guess, from watching this DVD, is the music.Having still not seen the series, I gather that it revolves around a group of high school teens who aren't a part of the ""popular crowd"" that become involved in the school's glee club (what we used to call the choir). Each episode includes a musical performance, many of which use popular songs. And that's what this DVD is all about.There isn't much acting ability that can be deciphered watching someone sing a song no matter how much you like the song or how much emotion the singer can put into it's performance. But you can enjoy the music and the vocal abilities of the singer. That's what this is all about.Each of the actors singing here (and I for one hope that each of them does their own singing and isn't being dubbed each week) does a stand up job and come off incredibly well. I don't see them selling billions of CDs on their own but as part of this group they should do well.So what songs do they offer? Here is a list for those interested:""On My Own""""Don't Stop Believin'""""Gold Digger""""I Say a Little Prayer""""Alone""""Somebody to Love""""It's My Life/Confessions Part II""""No Air""""You Keep Me Hanging On""""Defying Gravity""""I'll Stand By You""""Don't Stand So Close to Me/Young Girl""""Lean on Me""""Imagine""""True Colors""""Smile""""Don't Rain on My Parade""""You Can't Always Get What You Want""""Gives You Hell""""Hello""""Vogue""""Like a Virgin""""Like a Prayer""""Fire""""One Less Bell to Answer/A House is Not a Home""""Beautiful""""Run Joey Run""""Total Eclipse of the Heart""""Jessie's Girl""""Rose's Turn""""Bad Romance""""Beth""""Faithfully""""Any Way You Want It/Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin'""One thing to note about these selections. I've talked to kids in their 20s and late teens and trust me, most of them wouldn't recognize these songs if it weren't for this show. None of them would know who Burt Bacharach, Bonnie Tyler, Journey, The Rascals or Bill Withers are nor would they care. Which is kind of sad since it means they are missing so much great music that exist and only care about what's current. With any luck by watching this show perhaps a few of them will seek out the original artists and discover what they're missing. Until then they can enjoy the songs they love from the show with this disc and then maybe one day their children will seek out the originals.",3,MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC!,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,2527,"['So', 'everywhere', 'turn', 'keep', 'hearing', 'how', 'great', 'TV', 'series', 'GLEE', 'sister', 'family', 'are', 'GLEE', 'addicts', 'are', 'magazines', 'games', 'buttons', 'more', 'adorned', 'GLEE', 'logo', 'actors', 'what', 'special', 'guess', 'watching', 'DVD', 'music.Having', 'still', 'not', 'seen', 'series', 'gather', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'teens', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'part', 'popular', 'crowd', 'become', 'involved', 'school', 'glee', 'club', 'what', 'used', 'call', 'choir', 'episode', 'musical', 'performance', 'many', 'use', 'popular', 'songs', 'what', 'DVD', 'about.There', ""n't"", 'much', 'acting', 'ability', 'can', 'be', 'deciphered', 'watching', 'someone', 'sing', 'song', 'no', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'song', 'how', 'much', 'emotion', 'singer', 'can', 'put', 'performance', 'can', 'enjoy', 'music', 'vocal', 'abilities', 'singer', 'what', 'about.Each', 'actors', 'singing', 'here', 'one', 'hope', 'own', 'singing', ""n't"", 'being', 'dubbed', 'week', 'stand', 'up', 'job', 'come', 'off', 'incredibly', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'selling', 'billions', 'CDs', 'own', 'part', 'group', 'should', 'do', 'well.So', 'what', 'songs', 'do', 'offer', 'Here', 'list', 'interested', 'Own', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Believin', 'Gold', 'Digger', 'Say', 'Little', 'Prayer', 'Alone', 'Somebody', 'Love', 'My', 'Life/Confessions', 'Part', 'II', 'Air', 'Keep', 'Me', 'Hanging', 'Defying', 'Gravity', ""'ll"", 'Stand', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Stand', 'So', 'Close', 'Me/Young', 'Girl', 'Lean', 'Me', 'Imagine', 'True', 'Colors', 'Smile', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Rain', 'My', 'Parade', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Always', 'Get', 'What', 'Want', 'Hell', 'Hello', 'Vogue', 'Virgin', 'Prayer', 'Fire', 'One', 'Less', 'Bell', 'Answer/A', 'House', 'Not', 'Home', 'Beautiful', 'Run', 'Joey', 'Run', 'Total', 'Eclipse', 'Heart', 'Jessie', 'Girl', 'Rose', 'Turn', 'Bad', 'Romance', 'Beth', 'Faithfully', 'Way', 'Want', 'It/Lovin', 'Touchin', 'Squeezin', 'One', 'thing', 'note', 'selections', ""'ve"", 'talked', 'kids', '20s', 'late', 'teens', 'trust', 'most', 'would', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'songs', 'were', ""n't"", 'show', 'None', 'would', 'know', 'who', 'Burt', 'Bacharach', 'Bonnie', 'Tyler', 'Journey', 'Rascals', 'Bill', 'Withers', 'are', 'would', 'care', 'Which', 'kind', 'sad', 'are', 'missing', 'so', 'much', 'great', 'music', 'exist', 'only', 'care', 'what', 'current', 'luck', 'watching', 'show', 'perhaps', 'few', 'will', 'seek', 'out', 'original', 'artists', 'discover', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing', 'then', 'can', 'enjoy', 'songs', 'love', 'show', 'disc', 'then', 'maybe', 'one', 'day', 'children', 'will', 'seek', 'out', 'originals']",Glee Encore
1396732,AY3EENC2BGTGK,B004D9FLJY,"M. G. Gagliano ""Maria""","[4, 6]","Last night I watched Glee Encore soon to be released on DVD with my kids. This is the first time they have been allowed to watch Glee and the reason is, Glee is a very good show, with a very adult storyline. Sure it is about a high school and on at the 8:00 hour but folks, that doesn't mean your children should be watching it. The Glee club singing is the safest part of this show yet millions of people allow their children to watch it.My kids have heard of it, they see the DVD's I own and sing to the Glee Karoake Wii game but will not be allowed to watch the show until they are at least 18. I love the show but don't find it appropriate for kids.When I asked them to put the Glee DVD in they were shocked. Had mommy lost her mind, did she change her mind, can we really watch Glee? They did get to watch it and it was fun, dancing, singing along to 30 hit songs from the show. They now know the characters, learned some songs they didn't know and I can safely allow them to watch this DVD knowing that the adult theme of the show is not included! They can watch this with my blessing. In fact when they get home, I will ask again if they want to watch because I can't get some of the songs out of my head, especially, Puck singing Beth and Sue singing Vogue.You and your kids will love this.",5,The Best of Glee!

Don't get me wrong, I love the show but why release this with only some of the songs?  Why not wait a few months and put all of season 1 and 2's numbers together? Especially you are actually rebuying what is on the actual box sets.Of course not, FOX will not only come out with the Volume One and Two of each season but also the entire season box sets and now the Best of segments.I think they are going a bit overboard but probably realize that with anything it runs it's course and Glee will most likely do that in another couple of years.

I thought this collection would save me the trouble, especially since I didn't get into Glee until the middle of Season 1. And when I found it in Target for $10, I thought it would be a great buy.It's not, and seriously, don't waste your money. The numbers end by fading to black, often chopping off small bits that I personally felt would have been relevant. (I always add to the beginning and the end for context, and I missed that in this DVD.) If I wanted just the music, I would have bought the CDs. I also didn't like the fact that the numbers weren't listed on the back of the case.Would I buy an Encore if it came out for Season 2? Maybe, but this time I'd research it a bit more, especially since so many songs were left out of Encore for Season 1.Oh, wait, I get it!
