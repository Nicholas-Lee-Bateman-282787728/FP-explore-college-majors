Even though the character of Elle was not in the other movies (only in the books) I embraced it anyway.  I knew it would be a tearjerker as were the others and that's what makes a movie worth watching!  The story about Elle loosing her husband and child and coming to stay with brother Aaron was good and the subplots regarding the romance between Aaron's farm help and the Mayor's daughter were good, but what really had me going was when Aaron was hurt and the help he received in getting home again was really good.  Without giving too much away, I was reminded of a Little House on the Prairie episode where Laura runs away and meets up with a hermit, also played by Ernest Borgnine, and it's implied this hermit is God and is helping her.
