329667,A1DTCJV6KOMJOA,6302725542,A*,"[3, 6]","Born Yesterday has to be the only film that has an amazing cast, great dialogue and a history lesson all built into one. The film is centered around Judy Holiday (who won an Oscar for this role beating out Bette Davis and Gloria Swanson for All about eve and Sunset Boulevard)and rightfully so. From the first second you hear her speak your entranced by her. William Holden is also in the film but for the first and only time he seems to have taken a back seat in star wattage to Broderick Crawford his deep voice and impsoing stature is amazing on film. The plot is about a woman who everyone perceives is dumb but learns to respect herself and her intellignece through tutoring sessions with Holden and they eventually fall in love. Cukor frames the story beautifully. Never allowing the camera to seem as a third party to any of the personell scenes between Holden and holliday. The night they go to hear a symphony play is pure magic!! Watch Holliday breeeze through her lines with such class and humor. This has to be one of the funniest films ever made and can not be missed Judy Holliday deserved her Oscar for this film and she would have been amazing in Some Like It Hot!! Now that film would truly be perfect if she was in the role of Suga. But as it stand this film is the best romantic comedy EVER made period and should not be missed by anyone who enjoys laughing so much that their stomach cramps!",5,Born Again.,992390400,"06 13, 2001",2001,1411,"['Born', 'Yesterday', 'be', 'only', 'film', 'amazing', 'cast', 'great', 'dialogue', 'history', 'lesson', 'built', 'one', 'film', 'centered', 'Judy', 'Holiday', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role', 'beating', 'out', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Gloria', 'Swanson', 'All', 'eve', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'rightfully', 'so', 'first', 'second', 'hear', 'speak', 'entranced', 'William', 'Holden', 'also', 'film', 'first', 'only', 'time', 'have', 'taken', 'back', 'seat', 'star', 'wattage', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'deep', 'voice', 'impsoing', 'stature', 'amazing', 'film', 'plot', 'woman', 'who', 'everyone', 'dumb', 'respect', 'intellignece', 'tutoring', 'sessions', 'Holden', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love', 'Cukor', 'story', 'beautifully', 'Never', 'allowing', 'camera', 'seem', 'third', 'party', 'personell', 'scenes', 'Holden', 'holliday', 'night', 'go', 'hear', 'symphony', 'play', 'pure', 'magic', 'Watch', 'Holliday', 'breeeze', 'lines', 'such', 'class', 'humor', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Judy', 'Holliday', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'Hot', 'Now', 'film', 'would', 'truly', 'be', 'perfect', 'was', 'role', 'Suga', 'stand', 'film', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'EVER', 'made', 'period', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'anyone', 'who', 'laughing', 'so', 'much', 'stomach', 'cramps']",Born Yesterday VHS
329668,A14LAXM03WBX6E,6302725542,"A. Munnik ""firewatcher""","[4, 5]","1950 was a banner year for movies, with such outstanding films as &quot;All About Eve&quot;, &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; and others. What sets these movies apart from the travesties that are churned out these days is the quality of the screenplays. Unfortunately, all that was soon to change. The spectre of the House of Un-American Activities was just about to descend like a pall on the movie industry and within a few years many of the most talented and creative scenarists were blacklisted for their poltical points of view'But in 1950 it was still possible to make a BORN YESTERDAY with its hilarious caricature of the corrupting influence of wealth and power.George Cukor was the master of stage adaptations that relied on such high brow elements as fine writing and committed acting performances rather than gimmicks and flashy sets to get the point across. As early as 1933, Cukor had displayed his mettle with the classic comedy &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;. It was an injustice that Cukor was not given the recognition of his genius until 1964 for his &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (not his most typical work), but then Cukor's lifestyle was not exactly &quot;mainstream&quot; for his times and it is easy to imagine a Joe McCarthy poring over his file with a furrowed brow.Anyhow, Cukor's talent was recognized in the many actors and actresses who won Oscars under his direction. And Judy Holliday's is simply the best. In her first scene she says nothing, but her looks and bearing hint at sophistication. So it's quite a shock  when she opens her mouth in the following scene and with one word demolishes our preconceptions.Judy is at her best when she says nothing, such as in the famous card scene, or even better, when she commiserates with a beleagured Congressman and throws a wistful glance in the direction of her new found ally, the English Dictionary, when the Congressman inquires if she is one of his constituents.I purchased this DVD back in February but only got the opportunity to view it last week. Much to my chagrin, the last ten minutes were digitaly distorted to the point where the climatic final scene was indecipherable. I tried it on another DVD player with the same unhappy result. Amazon only honours refunds and exchanges for 30 days after date of purchase, so it looks like I am stuck with a flawed masterpiece, like the armless Venus de Milo!Also, Amazon advertises this release as a &quot;Widescreen&quot; production. I had been labouring under the impression that 1953's &quot;The Robe&quot; was the first feature length foray into Cinemascope widescreen. Perhaps they refer to the utterly forgetable remake of this timeless classic.",5,Let George Do It,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,2703,"['1950', 'was', 'banner', 'year', 'movies', 'such', 'outstanding', 'films', 'quot', 'Eve', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'quot', 'quot', 'Asphalt', 'Jungle', 'quot', 'others', 'What', 'movies', 'apart', 'travesties', 'are', 'churned', 'days', 'quality', 'screenplays', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'soon', 'change', 'spectre', 'House', 'Un-American', 'Activities', 'was', 'just', 'descend', 'pall', 'movie', 'industry', 'few', 'years', 'many', 'most', 'talented', 'creative', 'scenarists', 'were', 'blacklisted', 'poltical', 'points', ""view'But"", '1950', 'was', 'still', 'possible', 'make', 'BORN', 'YESTERDAY', 'hilarious', 'caricature', 'corrupting', 'influence', 'wealth', 'power.George', 'Cukor', 'was', 'master', 'stage', 'adaptations', 'relied', 'such', 'high', 'brow', 'elements', 'fine', 'writing', 'committed', 'acting', 'performances', 'rather', 'gimmicks', 'flashy', 'sets', 'get', 'point', 'across', 'As', 'early', '1933', 'Cukor', 'had', 'displayed', 'mettle', 'classic', 'comedy', 'quot', 'Dinner', 'Eight', 'quot', 'was', 'injustice', 'Cukor', 'was', 'not', 'given', 'recognition', 'genius', '1964', 'quot', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'quot', 'not', 'most', 'typical', 'work', 'then', 'Cukor', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'quot', 'mainstream', 'quot', 'times', 'easy', 'imagine', 'Joe', 'McCarthy', 'poring', 'file', 'furrowed', 'brow.Anyhow', 'Cukor', 'talent', 'was', 'recognized', 'many', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'won', 'Oscars', 'direction', 'Judy', 'Holliday', 'simply', 'best', 'first', 'scene', 'nothing', 'looks', 'bearing', 'hint', 'sophistication', 'quite', 'shock', 'when', 'mouth', 'following', 'scene', 'one', 'word', 'preconceptions.Judy', 'best', 'when', 'nothing', 'such', 'famous', 'card', 'scene', 'even', 'better', 'when', 'beleagured', 'Congressman', 'wistful', 'glance', 'direction', 'new', 'found', 'ally', 'English', 'Dictionary', 'when', 'Congressman', 'one', 'constituents.I', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'back', 'February', 'only', 'got', 'opportunity', 'view', 'last', 'week', 'Much', 'chagrin', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'were', 'digitaly', 'distorted', 'point', 'where', 'climatic', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'indecipherable', 'tried', 'DVD', 'player', 'same', 'unhappy', 'result', 'Amazon', 'only', 'refunds', 'exchanges', '30', 'days', 'date', 'purchase', 'am', 'stuck', 'flawed', 'masterpiece', 'armless', 'Venus', 'de', 'Milo', 'Also', 'Amazon', 'release', 'quot', 'Widescreen', 'quot', 'production', 'had', 'been', 'labouring', 'impression', '1953', 'quot', 'Robe', 'quot', 'was', 'first', 'feature', 'length', 'foray', 'Cinemascope', 'widescreen', 'Perhaps', 'refer', 'utterly', 'forgetable', 'remake', 'timeless', 'classic']",Born Yesterday VHS

Upon first hearing her screech, I expected to hate this Galatea character, but in fact, I loved her and loved the fact that there is a proto-feminist twist to the classic tale of a man making his ideal woman out of beautiful materials. In this tale, Galatea influences Pygmalion just as much if not more than Pygmalion influences her.Billie Dawn is a beautiful girl who forgot to get in line when they were passing out brains, or at least that is what the script would have you originally believe. She has done the only thing she could in attaching herself to a wealthy but cruel man who keeps her in style but won't marry her. Things are changing though in that now this ill-assorted couple has come to Washington to conquer and Billie doesn't seem to be up to the challenge socially or intellectually. William Holden is hired to train her in the social graces and to give her the education she never had. The two are immediately attracted, under the unheeding nose of Billie's keeper.How they get together and how Billie blossoms as a person and teaches Holden a thing or two about love and life is a joy to watch.

Broderick Crawford gives a powerful performance, but sometimes he  goes a bit too far and we get scared instead of laughing.

329671,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,6302725542,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[1, 17]","This original Oscar-winning movie starring Judy Holliday was clever, witty and wise.  It was shown on TCM with Nick Clooney guiding us with his winning ways into the mood of the Forties.  He couldn't have seen the original at the theaters, either, as he and I are the same age, so I know I didn't see it when I was only ten.  I thought the moll was ditzy and pretty dumb with a silly-sounding voice.  In Pulaski, Nate Street from Hickman County, a radio personality who liked to be thought of as a drama critic as he always attended dress rehearsal of the college plays, voiced his like for this crazy dame.  So, I thought that if he thought she was so good, as she was in ""Bells Are Ringing,"" maybe he was right again.Today, I saw a revival of ""Born Yesterday"" with my favorite local actor as the genius, Paul Verrall.  He was splendid as I expected, though he did not have the Washington, D.C. accent.  The whole performance was professionally done at the Clarence Brown Theater here.  Previously, I was lucky to have stumbled into a performance in which Terry Weber was a one-man play about Abraham Lincoln/John Wilkes Booth and have never enjoyed a performance of any play more.  He has an unusual talent to be serious, musical, and sometimes funny.The play centers around political corruption in which Billie becomes unknowingly involved.  That is, until Paul tutors her on proper ways of thinking and talking so as to 'fit in.'  Judy played to the camera and acted as a silly, dumb blonde.  Today, the actress was unusually clever in adopting Judy's unique way of speaking but showing how easy it is to change practically overnight into an educated woman who can fall in love and not just be used by a rich man.  She was smart enough to take her furs when she left him.  Broaderick Crawford, known for ""Highway Patrol"" on television, could not have been as brutal as Neil Friedman from Chicago as Harry Brock.  He didn't even use his Chicago accent.  That was good acting to say the least.  Terry was the star of this revival of sorts, a revolution against violence and money laundering of any kind.",3,A Revival of Sorts.,1157846400,"09 10, 2006",2006,2105,"['original', 'Oscar-winning', 'movie', 'starring', 'Judy', 'Holliday', 'was', 'clever', 'witty', 'wise', 'was', 'shown', 'TCM', 'Nick', 'Clooney', 'guiding', 'winning', 'ways', 'mood', 'Forties', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'theaters', 'either', 'are', 'same', 'age', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'when', 'was', 'only', 'ten', 'thought', 'moll', 'was', 'ditzy', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'silly-sounding', 'voice', 'Pulaski', 'Nate', 'Street', 'Hickman', 'County', 'radio', 'personality', 'who', 'liked', 'be', 'thought', 'drama', 'critic', 'always', 'attended', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'college', 'plays', 'voiced', 'like', 'crazy', 'dame', 'So', 'thought', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'Bells', 'Are', 'Ringing', 'maybe', 'was', 'right', 'again.Today', 'saw', 'revival', 'Born', 'Yesterday', 'favorite', 'local', 'actor', 'genius', 'Paul', 'Verrall', 'was', 'splendid', 'expected', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'accent', 'whole', 'performance', 'was', 'professionally', 'done', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'Theater', 'here', 'Previously', 'was', 'lucky', 'have', 'stumbled', 'performance', 'Terry', 'Weber', 'was', 'one-man', 'play', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln/John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'have', 'never', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'play', 'more', 'unusual', 'talent', 'be', 'serious', 'musical', 'sometimes', 'funny.The', 'play', 'centers', 'political', 'corruption', 'Billie', 'unknowingly', 'involved', 'Paul', 'tutors', 'proper', 'ways', 'thinking', 'talking', 'so', ""'fit"", 'Judy', 'played', 'camera', 'acted', 'silly', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'Today', 'actress', 'was', 'unusually', 'clever', 'adopting', 'Judy', 'unique', 'way', 'speaking', 'showing', 'how', 'easy', 'change', 'practically', 'overnight', 'educated', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'fall', 'love', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'used', 'rich', 'man', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'take', 'furs', 'when', 'left', 'Broaderick', 'Crawford', 'known', 'Highway', 'Patrol', 'television', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'brutal', 'Neil', 'Friedman', 'Chicago', 'Harry', 'Brock', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'use', 'Chicago', 'accent', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'say', 'least', 'Terry', 'was', 'star', 'revival', 'sorts', 'revolution', 'violence', 'money', 'laundering', 'kind']",Born Yesterday VHS

329680,AT9WS10X433SP,6302725542,"cj wollam ""cj""","[0, 0]","I believe the phrase ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" was probably  first used in 1993 when this movie was remade with Don Johnson, Melanie Griffith and John Goodman.  While good actors starred in the remake, Judy Holliday really is Billie Dawn! Her chemistry with William Holden and Broderick Crawford is off the charts, and their comedic timing is phenomenal. A supposed dumb blonde, this ex-showgirl is anything but dumb.  She starts out believing that as long as she knows how to get the ""things"" she wants she has all the knowledge she needs.  But when a handsome reporter (Holden) arrives to get the story on Billie's crooked and abusive boyfriend (Crawford), he hires the reporter to ""smarten her up"".  Billie learns a lot during this process about herself and the ""things"" she really wants.  While Billie and the reporter are naturally and predictably falling in the love, they also discover that Billie has had control of the boyfriend's money and companies all along.  Since the boyfriend uses his money to illegally ""persuade"" government officials, Billie and the reporter use this new information to ""persuade"" her now ex-boyfriend to do the right thing before Billie and the reporter leave together and, we assume, live happily ever after.  Since All About Eve and Sunset Boulevard are 2 of my favorite movies, it would have been impossible for me to vote for the Best Actress Academy Award in 1950, but Judy Holliday deservedly won it for her portrayal of Billie Dawn beating out Bette Davis and Gloria Swanson.

329682,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6302725542,Classic film buff,"[0, 0]","Today would have been Judy Holliday's 92nd birthday, and TCM is showing ""Born Yesteday"" as part of a three film birthday tribute to the late, great actress. Watching it yet again, on this her birthday, I wanted to pay my own tribute to her, in this her most famous performance.Harry Brock (Broderick Crawford) a loud mouthed, vulgar thug who is a multimillionaire from his junk empire arrives in Washington DC to buy a crooked senator to help advance his own shady deals.  Accompanying him is his gorgeous but dim witted mistress Billie Dawn (Judy Holliday); together they are entrenched in a luxurious hotel suite while Harry pursues his nefarious schemes.  However Harry's right hand man, former lawyer and politician Jim Devery (Howard St. John) and Harry worry that Billie with her lack of education and blunt, forthright manner may be a liability.  Accordingly Harry hires a bright young political writer Paul Verrall (William Holden) who has tried to interview Harry to educate Billie and smooth out the rough edges.  However as the saying goes, a little learning is a dangerous thing, as Harry finds out to his dismay.Judy Holliday got her signature role of Billie Dawn on a fluke.  Garson Kanin originally wrote the play ""Born Yesterday"" with film actress Jean Arthur in mind; however she departed in out of town tryouts. Judy Holliday stepped in and as the clich&eacute; goes ""a star was born"".  Still even though she wowed them on the Great White Way, she was almost passed over for the role when Columbia Pictures bought the film rights when studio boss Harry Cohn wanted to cast his rebellious superstar Rita Hayworth in the role.  However Garson Kanin who was retained to write the screenplay wanted Holliday, and enlisted his wife Ruth Gordon, friends Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy and director George Cukor to persuade Holliday to take a key supporting role in ""Adam's Rib"", a role to showcase both her talent and attractiveness.  Cohn was duly impressed, and Holliday got the chance to repeat her Broadway triumph.Ms. Holliday is just wonderful, creating a deftly played, glittering gem, not just the standard stereotype of the ""dumb blonde"".  Her Billie Dawn begins as a vacuous, bored ex showgirl, but starts to emerge as a slightly tarnished innocent in her early relationship with Paul.  Under his tutelage, Billie begins to blossom, her nascent shrewd intelligence revealing itself.  As Paul and she develop romantic feelings for each other, Billie begins to question the emptiness of her life with Harry, and also develops suspicions that Harry is up to no good in Washington.  Ms. Holliday will make you laugh with her many priceless lines  rendered in her uniquely nasal tones, but she will also touch you as she tries so hard to make up for twenty nine wasted years in her crash course in higher learning.  Billie evolves and changes in a most natural convincing way, and Ms. Holliday turns in a multi-layered finely honed portrayal.  She looks sensational in her glamorous Jean Louis gowns, and had I think the most beautiful bare smooth shoulders of any film actress, ideal for kissing, nuzzling, caressing or nibbling! Ms. Holliday beat out two of the most iconic portrayals for the Best Actress Academy Award in 1950, Bette Davis in ""All About Eve"" and Gloria Swanson in ""Sunset Boulevard"", in addition to obtaining a Golden Globe. While I'm not quite sure Judy Holliday should have won over Bette Davis at her peak as Margo Channing, her Billie Dawn was certainly more deserving than Gloria Swanson's hammy Norma Desmond. A better win for Ms. Holliday would have been for her tragicomic role as housewife Florence Keefer in 1952's ""The Marrying Kind"", again in a part written especially for her by Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon and expertly directed again by George Cukor. In this besides her usual comic sparkle, she reveals hidden depths as a fine dramatic actress. However, she wasn't even nominated, and so it goes yet another Oscar snafu.1950 was William Holden's year for showing off his versatility with this film and the classic ""Sunset Boulevard.""  He's an admirable romantic foil to Ms. Holliday, with the requisite leading man dark handsomeness, but with enough good humored talent not to be overshadowed by Ms. Holliday, a passionately earnest hero with an engaging twinkle at times. As the ox like, bellowing bully Harry Brock, Broderick Crawford succeeds almost too well, at one point when he menaces Billie it veers uncomfortably into abuse. This is difficult to watch, as the viewer sees the terrible price Billie had had to pay for the furs and jewels over the years.The witty screenplay was written"" officially"" by Albert  Mannheimer, with an uncredited assist by Garson Kanin, which contains many memorable one liners, most expertly delivered with a panache by Ms. Holliday. George Cukor delivers his usual meticulous direction, sophisticated comedy was his forte. Another pleasure is that a lot of the film was actually shot in Washington DC. What a joy to see such magnificent landmarks as the US Capitol Building, the Library of Congress, the National Gallery of Art and the Jefferson Memorial. circa 1949-50.  I've visit all of these several times, these and other Washington DC sights still always fill me with awe, wonder and pride at the greatness of our country, and give me a little thrill. It's nice to see these historic monuments have changed very little since they were filmed circa 1949-1950, gives one a feeling of continuity!So a toast to the birthday girl Judy Holliday, who sadly like her comedic counterparts Carole Lombard and Kay Kendall died tragically young.  In Ms. Holliday's case it was cancer in 1965, at only 43 years of age.  However, she will always live in her immortal Billie Dawn, her film legacy is regrettably slim, only nine films altogether, but she's pure gold in all of them.  I recommend if you haven't seen them already, ""Adam's Rib"", ""The Marrying Kind"", ""It Should Happen to You"", ""The Solid Gold Cadillac"" and her final film of her last Broadway triumph ""Bells Are Ringing"".  As long as they're preserved, this delightful charmer will never be forgotten.",5,"""It's only fair, we'll educate each other!""",1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,6149,"['Today', 'would', 'have', 'been',

I can see why many people love this film,but it wasn't my speed/my type.

Gentile,"[53, 56]","From the moment she enters the picture and screeches ""Whaaaaattttt??"", in a voice that could peel wallpaper, you can't take your eyes off Judy Hollidays ""Billie Dawn."" In this movie adaptation of the Garson Kanin play, directed by famed ""womans director"" George Cukor, she takes a wonderfully written character and turns her into a classic movie performance that no one else could have played. Her crass, monosyllabic Billie is SO dumb, that, when her corrupt bully boyfriend, played by Broderick Crawford, first proposes to the owlish journalist, played by William Holden, that he refine Billies rough edges so she can be presented into the Washington society that he hopes to manipulate, well...you wonder how he can EVER mold this dim-witted clay. Along the way, she, for the first time, begins to actually THINK, and her development of a conscience and awareness of her self worth is as moving as it is comical. The backdrop of corrupt politicians who can be bought for a price (some things never change), provides the moral (immoral) climate in which Billie has unquestioningly (til now) existed. Seeing her grow into someone with character is touching to behold. In the scene towards the end, in the Rotunda, where she finally realizes the changes within her, and the potential for the ""good"" in life, it always brings a tear to the eye. As everyone knows, Judy Holliday beat out the toughest competition ever, Bette Davis for ""All; About Eve"", and Gloria Swanson for ""Sunset Boulevard"", to win the best actress Oscar for 1950. A good friend of mine, who knew Judy Holliday, and is presently writing a play about her life, corroborates what many already know, that she was an intensely serious and intelligent woman. Tragically, she died much too young. But her film roles will always ensure her reputation as a brilliant actress, with her portrayal of ""Billie Dawn"" being the role for which she'll most be remembered. There will never be another Judy Holliday, nor another Billie Dawn. (Don't even MENTION the Melanie Griffith remake!)

The story, from the stage success, concerns a crass junk yard tycoon (Broderick Crawford) who goes to Washington to buy a Senator--and promptly considers that his blonde-bimbo mistress Billie Dawn (Holiday) lacks enough poise for such refined circles.  He accordingly entices a reporter (William Holden) to &quot;smarten her up.&quot;  But things soon get out of hand: once her mind is awakened, Billie Dawn begins to perceive her lover and his political intrigues in a very different light.The comedy is genuine, and Crawford and Holden are as memorable as Holiday herself.  But there is some serious stuff behind the hilarity: issues of personal integrity, honesty, and civic duty become increasingly important as Billie evolves, and ultimately she must make a choice between her old life and a new one.  The film very neatly balances its comic elements with its serious side, and neither predominate nor throw the film off center; director Cukor steers a perfect course.

I read a few of the other &quot;reviews&quot; and disagreed with almost everything about them except their praise for Judy Holliday and the one comment that Crawford came across menacing rather than humorous.  Come to think of it, he WAS menacing, remember when he hit her?  There was very little humor of any kind in this flick (what there was, aside from two or three genuine witticisms, came from Holliday's supposed dumbness), it was very serious and far from light.  I disliked the adaptation from stage to screen, particularly and emphatically the ridiculous ending in the car when Holden gives the cop his marriage license.  Good grief!  I do not like Garson Kanin anyway, on Bway or off, I think he's very dull and unfunny, and think he writes better when working with his strident wife Ruth Gordon (like on another Holliday flick, much warmer and gentler and more human and more humane than this one, &quot;The Marrying Kind,&quot; finally out this month on DVD).  I was surprised to read Holliday's competition for the Oscar, she was definitely good, but THAT good?  All three of them should have gotten an Oscar.  Judy Holliday is one of my all-time heroes (heroines), and I found this picture a big disappointment, lit up only when she was on-screen.  By the way, I may live to eat my words if this &quot;review&quot; is posted, but speaking of dumbness, didn't ANY of these other &quot;reviewers&quot; proof their &quot;reviews&quot; before submitting them?

He hires journalist Paul Verrall (William Holden) to give his lady a crash course in ""culture."" The immediate physical attraction grows stronger as her head becomes filled with actual knowledge.Billie was fine as long as she signed papers she didn't read, kept her mouth shut, absorbed insults, and sat around looking pretty. With her newfound ""culture"" she begins to peruse contracts, ask questions, volley insults, and walk away from arguments. Paul wanted a big story. And through Billie, he gets one.As ""one of the most successful comedies in Broadway history"" BORN YESTERDAY ran 1643 performances with Holliday as the lead in 1200.

Judy Holliday shines like gold; Cukor always could bring out the best in his leading women. William Holden and Broderick Crawford also give solid performances.The action begins when a rather boorish, rough and tough guy named Harry Brock (Broderick Crawford) comes into Washington, D.C. with his entourage to get some legislation passed to help his multimillion dollar business. With Brock come his ostensibly dumb blonde girlfriend Emma ""Billie"" Dawn (Judy Holliday) and his assistant. Before long it's obvious that Brock's girlfriend Billie needs some social refinement lessons; therefore Brock hires savvy reporter Paul Verrall (William Holden) to ""teach her the ropes."" That way Brock can impress the congressman he wants to create legislation to help his business.Unfortunately for Brock, however, the social refinement lessons Paul gives to Billie eventually result in Billie's becoming more and more sophisticated and educated than Harry himself! Harry begins to feel small as Billie starts to outshine him; she's not a ""dumb blonde"" after all.Of course, the plot can go in many directions from here. Will Harry make Billie stop taking refinement lessons from Paul? Will Billie like becoming more refined? Will Harry's investment pay off--will Billie's new found social graces and knowledge make it easier for Brock to influence a congressman? Watch the movie and find out!The cinematography is great in the scenes filmed around Washington, D.C.; and the choreography works well in scenes near the end when people must confront each other at the end of the movie.Unfortunately, although there are funny moments in this film, there are some rather dated and sappy lines to contend with. ""Knowledge is power"" somehow seems outdated; and listen for some high and mighty ""stuff"" about how you just can't buy the people we elect to Congress. OUCH! On the other hand, I agree with people who note that the scene in which Billie and Harry play cards is very, very well done and humorous as well.The DVD extras offer us a few trailers and some vintage advertising.Overall, Born Yesterday is a dated but somewhat funny movie that you can enjoy if you like this type of film.

He uses his dizzy girlfriend Billie (Judy Holliday) as a middleman, though he really controls everything she ""owns."" She is just content to accept his lavish gifts and be pretty. That is until Paul(William Holden) comes along. He is hired by Harry to educate Billie; she embarasses him in front of sophisticated company. In the process, she learns just how corrupt her fiancee is and why her father has disowned her. She also develops eyes for her teacher.Holliday won the Oscar for her performance in this film against such professionals as Bette Davis and Gloria Swanson. Indeed, her performance is wonderful. One can watch her character transform before one's eyes from a gold digging chorus girl to an intelligent woman. Her relationship with Holden is believable and powerful. In fact, all of the roles are well developed.

Born Yesterday made an overnight star of Judy Holliday, when 3 days before the Broadway opening, Jean Arthur dropped out due to illness, and Holliday, on a diet of coffee and cigarettes, learned and opened in the role to rapturous reviews. The rest is history, Katherine Hepburn brought her out to Hollywood to appear in Adam's Rib, and she was a star. She did win the Oscar for re-creating her Born Yesterday role on film. And an Oscar winning role it sure is, every gesture, nuance and expression, are dead on. Holliday was brilliant at playing the dumb blonde when in reality she was anything but...she was actually extremely educated and I've heard rumors that she was a member of Mensa.

329727,A1C80B497LCYKA,6302725542,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[1, 1]","I really like William Holden in the early 50's: he was fresh, full of energy, upbeat, physical - and when he put on glasses, as he did in Born Yesterday, intellectual and vulnerable. He was the perfect leading man, and very enjoyable to watch in this film. But the real star of Born Yesterday is Judy Holliday, who won an Oscar for her performance. Her character, Billie, goes through the greatest change in our story, and shows off her incredible range.She starts out as the dumb-blonde squeeze of a big-shot con man, Harry, played wonderfully by Broderick Crawford, who made his millions in the junk business, and has now come to Washington to ""buy"" a senator in order to help his business. When he drops Billie into her first Washington social engagement, he realizes he's going to have problems with her: she ""just ain't couth."" So he hires William Holden's character, Paul - a writer and self-styled intellectual - to smooth out her rough edges. Paul is immediately attracted to Billie and agrees to take her under his wing. What results is a crash course in US History, Government, Civics, etc., with Washington as the classroom. A by-product is that Paul and Billie fall in love.Now Billie really becomes a problem, as she starts questioning all of Harry's decisions, especially his attempt at controlling a United States senator. Billie must decide whether doing the right thing, as Paul advises, is worth losing her life of leisure, and even losing her life, since Harry is now threatening her. In spite of the gangster undertones, it's full of laughs, attractive costumes and sets, and a priceless view of Washington in 1950. But more than that, it's a real education on the power of an individual to do the right thing, and how it basically takes the same thing to maintain freedom in an individual life as it does in a democracy. Directed by George Cukor, Born Yesterday is a delight to watch, especially Judy Holliday - and Holden ain't no slouch either.Waitsel Smith",5,EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING TALE SET IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,1980,"['really', 'William', 'Holden', 'early', '50', 'was', 'fresh', 'full', 'energy', 'upbeat', 'physical', 'when', 'put', 'glasses', 'did', 'Born', 'Yesterday', 'intellectual', 'vulnerable', 'was', 'perfect', 'leading', 'man', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'film', 'real', 'star', 'Born', 'Yesterday', 'Judy', 'Holliday', 'who', 'won', 'Oscar', 'performance', 'character', 'Billie', 'greatest', 'change', 'story', 'off', 'incredible', 'range.She', 'out', 'dumb-blonde', 'squeeze', 'big-shot', 'con', 'man', 'Harry', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'who', 'made', 'millions', 'junk', 'business', 'now', 'come', 'Washington', 'buy', 'senator', 'order', 'help', 'business', 'When', 'Billie', 'first', 'Washington', 'social', 'engagement', 'going', 'have', 'problems', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'couth', 'William', 'Holden', 'character', 'Paul', 'writer', 'self-styled', 'intellectual', 'smooth', 'out', 'rough', 'edges', 'Paul', 'immediately', 'attracted', 'Billie', 'take', 'wing', 'What', 'results', 'crash', 'course', 'US', 'History', 'Government', 'Civics', 'etc.', 'Washington', 'classroom', 'by-product', 'Paul', 'Billie', 'fall', 'love.Now', 'Billie', 'really', 'problem', 'questioning', 'Harry', 'decisions', 'especially', 'attempt', 'controlling', 'United', 'States', 'senator', 'Billie', 'must', 'decide', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'Paul', 'worth', 'losing', 'life', 'leisure', 'even', 'losing', 'life', 'Harry', 'now', 'threatening', 'spite', 'gangster', 'undertones', 'full', 'laughs', 'attractive', 'costumes', 'sets', 'priceless', 'view', 'Washington', '1950', 'more', 'real', 'education', 'power', 'individual', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'how', 'basically', 'same', 'thing', 'maintain', 'freedom', 'individual', 'life', 'democracy', 'Directed', 'George', 'Cukor', 'Born', 'Yesterday', 'delight', 'watch', 'especially', 'Judy', 'Holliday', 'Holden', 'ai', ""n't"", 'slouch', 'either.Waitsel', 'Smith']",Born Yesterday VHS
