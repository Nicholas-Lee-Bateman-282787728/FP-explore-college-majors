There's absolutely no continuity in it, it jumps randomly and without warning.  The script is terrible, the acting was horrid, and it  left me lost and confused and very irritated.  I think they made this as an  excuse to show some really badly done quasi-sex scenes, it was just the  worst.  Jane Longenecker looked embarassed to be in it, poor thing.Still  need to satisfy your longing to see a movie along the lines of a creepy  Coroner?  Try the film Phantasm instead.

I couldn't  help but laugh at the choreograph looking fights.the rest of the movie  concerns the young lawyer trying to get back at the coroner for all he did  to her...  cutting off a finger.  she being a lawyer; he could/should have  done worse.this movie is still fun to watch, if at least once.  but I  wanted to see so much more.  gore, gore, gore, was all on my mind as I  watched it.  and nothing of the like popped up.  there are a few blood on  women's bodies shots but that's about it.  and not alot of blood either.maybe if the title was 'ally mcbeal and buffy team to get rid of the  local coroner' it might have worked.  but this coroner chops up his victims  real tame, if at all.",3,"more gore, please...",960681600,"06 11, 2000",2000,1482,"['title', 'Coroner', 'expected', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'movie', 'delivered', 'buckets', 'blood', 'disembodied', 'body', 'parts', 'organs', 'bones', 'well', 'get', 'picture', 'movie', 'only', 'had', 'blood', 'not', 'alot', 'some.the', 'basic', 'story', 'local', 'coroner', 'killing', 'off', 'young', 'female', 'suicide', 'victims', 'young', 'ladies', 'wanted', 'die', 'failed', 'attempts', 'coroner', 'just', 'finish', 'job', 'them.his', 'next', 'victim', 'be', 'lawyer', 'catching', 'basement', 'going', 'kill', 'however', 'asked', 'more', 'what', 'bargained', 'apparently', 'teach', 'vampire', 'style', 'martial', 'arts', 'law', 'firm', 'lawyer', 'few', 'choreographed', 'kicks', 'chops', 'coroner', 'escapes', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'choreograph', 'looking', 'fights.the', 'rest', 'movie', 'young', 'lawyer', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'coroner', 'did', 'cutting', 'off', 'finger', 'being', 'lawyer', 'could/should', 'have', 'done', 'worse.this', 'movie', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'wanted', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'gore', 'gore', 'gore', 'was', 'mind', 'watched', 'nothing', 'like', 'popped', 'up', 'are', 'few', 'blood', 'women', 'bodies', 'shots', 'not', 'alot', 'blood', 'either.maybe', 'title', 'was', ""'ally"", 'mcbeal', 'buffy', 'team', 'get', 'rid', 'local', 'coroner', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'coroner', 'up', 'victims', 'real', 'tame']",N/A

And her co-star is Dean St. Louis.  Where were their agents when they chose such ridiculous names?  What's next Minnie Apellas St. Paul?  Or how about Della Ware Heights?  Oh, well.  THE CORONER is one poorly done piece of cinematic waste.  Aside from the awful acting, the script is so lame and ridiculous, there can be no chance for even suspending disbelief.  Longnecker's character does so many stupid things and the esoteric ending is laughably pointless.

Thats what your constantly ask yourself as you watch this film.This movie is mindless,tastless, and lets not forget boring.Theris nothing but nudity and a bunch of quick flashesof various scenes which confuses the hell out of you. I thinkl they really tried to make this film somewhat of a thriller.The beginning of the movie is flooded with naked women dancing around all these men for a good five minutes and then it goes to a scene where one of the dancers leaves the bar then gets killed.At least I think she gets killed since they don't really show what happens to her. Or maybe they did and I was'nt paying attention because it was so boring. I knew from the very start of the film it was'nt going to be good. The acting is some of the worst I've seen and so is the castingof the serial Killer a.k.a the coroner.There no gore, just a bunch of blood  and flashes of blood spattering everywhere. What the hell is that about? Well anyway, there are some torture scenes, but nothing really special. The ending of the movie does not really explain much of what happens next. It's just like there all this stuff happening to the girl and it seems like she's got nothing else going for her then something happens at the end that's it. It does'nt explain what happen to all the stuff that was against her. This is another one of those movies where the director spends more money on the cover of the film box than he does on the actual film. They make the cover look all cool and make it seem like it will be a good movie to watch, but when you actually watch it you ask where the hell all the money went? I've fallen pray to that tactic many times and I hate it. Here is a word of advice for all you horror fans out there. If you see a movie in a viedo store and you never heard of it before and the cover of the box looks cool and when you read the plot in the back , it sounds a little cool, Don't rent it! Because most likely the film will suck badly. Maybe in some occasions the film will be good, but most of the time it will suck. Just like this one did.
