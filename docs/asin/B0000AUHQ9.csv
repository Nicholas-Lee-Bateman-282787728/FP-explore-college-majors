768006,A3QDALCWH5OB80,B0000AUHQ9,Andreas,"[5, 9]","After disappointing season 3, 4, partly 5 and 6 of Dawson's Creek the series finale clearly bears the mark of director and writer Kevin Williamson. His returns is reflected in the focus on the 5 friends Dawson, Joey, Jen, Pacey and Jack. Thanks to obviously Mr. Williamson, the final episode got rid of those unnecessary characters of Audrey, C.J. and whoever. These characters along with Charly (season 5) and Gretchen (season 4) did not fit anyway with the original concept of Dawson's Creek.Although season 3 did include some interesting episodes, the final episode was by far the best episode since season 2. The most touching scene was the one with Dawson reflecting at the creek, seeing Jen getting out of the cab 10 years ago. The scene also shows that Dawson is the best character in the series, the only (besides Jack) really thinking about Jen. Pacey and Joey rather busy with their own relationship, pretty egoistic. In addition, it also highlights the talent of James van der Beek as an actor.To make a long story short: the series finale is a &quot;must&quot; for every fan of the show and what it originally wanted to convey to the audience. &quot;The series that spoke to a generation ...&quot;",5,Back to the roots with Kevin Williamson,1081814400,"04 13, 2004",2004,1209,"['disappointing', 'season', '3', '4', 'partly', '5', '6', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'series', 'clearly', 'mark', 'director', 'writer', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'returns', 'reflected', 'focus', '5', 'friends', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'Jen', 'Pacey', 'Jack', 'Thanks', 'obviously', 'Mr.', 'Williamson', 'final', 'episode', 'got', 'rid', 'unnecessary', 'characters', 'Audrey', 'C.J', 'whoever', 'characters', 'Charly', 'season', '5', 'Gretchen', 'season', '4', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'anyway', 'original', 'concept', 'Dawson', 'Creek.Although', 'season', '3', 'did', 'include', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'episode', 'season', '2', 'most', 'touching', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'Dawson', 'reflecting', 'creek', 'seeing', 'Jen', 'getting', 'cab', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'scene', 'also', 'Dawson', 'best', 'character', 'series', 'only', 'Jack', 'really', 'thinking', 'Jen', 'Pacey', 'Joey', 'rather', 'busy', 'own', 'relationship', 'pretty', 'egoistic', 'addition', 'also', 'talent', 'James', 'van', 'der', 'Beek', 'actor.To', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'series', 'finale', 'quot', 'must', 'quot', 'fan', 'show', 'what', 'originally', 'wanted', 'convey', 'audience', 'quot', 'series', 'spoke', 'generation', 'quot']",N/A

768008,A2620OKD8G71CL,B0000AUHQ9,Bob,"[2, 7]","I was both pleased with this season finale, and sad. Now, I never liked Jen (Michelle Williams) being on the show. I don't know why, but the character and how it was played was just awful. She was too concerned about herself ALL the time. Anyway, when I found out that she had a heart problem, and was going to die, I just broke into tears. She was never my favorite character, but her death made me see her in a different way. I was pleased with the ending. Joey (Katie Holmes) and Pacey (Joshua Jackson) ended up together. I am a huge fan of this relationship, and loved that they got to be together. Dawson has been producing a television show called ""The Creek"", which is about the life of him, Joey, Pacey, and the whole gang. Jack (Kerr Smith), and Pacey's brother Doug end up together. Jack wanted to raise Jen's baby, Amy, so that's what those two end up doing. The ending shows Joey ans Pacey sitting together in her New York apartment watching Dawson's show. They call him up to tell him how great it was.

I don't like how Pacey is always undermining his other relationships. IMO, it is all a plot to get people to like Joey more than Audrey and even Andie. Funny, how people say that Pacey and Joey were the true romance of the show. I don't agree with that at all. Pacey and Joey didn't have any romantic feelings during seasons 1 and 2. They didn't have any romantic feelings until Pacey kissed her in The Cinderella Story. Joey finally kisses him in Stolen Kisses and then they get together but break up and then get back together. Then they date for an entire season ( season 4) break up because of Pacey's insecurities ( some true romance, Pacey was too insecureto actually want to make it work). Then Pacey and Joey DON'T date during seasons 5 and half of season 6. They get together and then break up and then Bam!

This finale was one of the best series finales on television, and I've managed to see them all, from Friends, Seinfeld, Millennium, X-Files, and some far too old for many young readers and viewers to remember -- MASH, All in the Family, One Day at a Time...etc.  Dawson's Creek was one of those wonderful shows that allowed the viewer to care about the characters and about what happens to them.  Though many young people across the country cannot relate to the New England lives of these teens, their stories are human enough to cross the barriers that separate the various cultures in the U.S.  Let's face it, not many kids can jump on a boat and go sailing all summer instead of finding gainful employment.But most will relate to the on and off romances between Joey and Dawson, Pacey and Andie and Joey {and just about every other cute babe who crossed his path}, Jack's struggle with his homosexualtiy, Joey's determination to succeed in school and be happy in life, Dawson's never-ending angst, and Jen's 180 degree turnabout from being the town floozy with drug and alcohol issues, to the dedicated single mom in the finale.  We laugh, cry, and cheer for these characters, and as they close the book on this series, we aren't left with any unanswered questions.  One by one all the ends are tied up, some not as neatly as we'd like, but in the end we know they'll all be okay.  The music chosen, as always with this show, is just perfect.  You will need a box of tissues for this one, take my word.

The show borrows a lot from its history, like it always has, but honors it in a touching way. The writers also poke fun at the show too, not taking itself too seriously. The show follows the Capeside gang 5 years later. They all come back to Capeside for Mrs. Leery's wedding. Joey is startled when she finds out her boyfriend Christopher is going to propose to her, and in true Joey fashion, runs away. Pacey is running the restaurant in town. Jack is dating Pacey's brother the cop, who is still in the closet. Jen comes back with a baby, who she is raising with Grams.Suddenly at the reception, Jen collapses and Grams reveals Jen's secret, that she has a heart condition. Soon we find out that Jen is dying. The last half of the show was especially sad, I found myself crying for the whole thing. It was just done so poignantly, playing on the show's history, and the characters we've grown to love. That's what was so sad about Jen dying. She wasn't a huge part of the triangle of Joey, Dawson and Pacey which enompassed most of the show, but in a way she really was the heart of the show.

For 6 years, Joey and Dawson continued coming back to each other and Joey even sleeps with Dawson near the end of the show.

Dawson would have been completed devoted to Joey had she let him.  In the end, she chooses Pacey.  Now if that wasn't enough, when she visits Jen in the hospital during Jen's dying days, Joey tells Jen she has always known who she should be with (meaning Pacey).  That line really ticked me off.  If Joey had always known that she should have been with Pacey, while was she always dangling Dawson from her chain, sleeping with him and everything else?  I thought the series ended with Joey looking like the bad guy.  The show should have ended with Joey having a completely new love interest.  Dawson should have told them both to ""you know what"" and go to California and never look back.  Pacey should go back out to sea and date a new girl at every port.

768020,ALWNNMP1873GA,B0000AUHQ9,Lucy,"[1, 1]","I watched Dawson's Creek sporadically during its original run (I've now got it all on DVD), but the main thing that always drew me in was the romance between Pacey and Joey. I stopped watching at all after the fourth season, because I could see that the writers were contriving to throw Dawson and Joey back together despite of the fact that the Pacey/Joey relationship was pure magic in Seasons 3/4. I tuned into the Finale just out of curiousity and didn't expect the writers to reverse their course and have Joey choose Pacey. It was an awesome ending to me, especially viewing the Finale on DVD with the extended scenes and commentary.I just never saw anything remotely romantic between Dawson and Joey, just a friendship stuck back in childhood and becoming more and more unhealthy for both of them. Conversely, with Pacey, Joey had a real, adult romantic relationship. She could be herself as a woman, not as the girl down the creek as Dawson always saw her. To me that is the difference and why it could never work out between Dawson and Joey. They kept confusing their friendship with romantic love because it was the safe route to go. But Pacey made Joey ""feel alive"" in her own words. People say that Dawson and Joey had some type of epic relationship, but I saw the buds of Pacey and Joey's romance all the way back in Season 1 and from Season 3 on, whether they were together or not, everytime they were in each other's presence, the air sizzled. Katie Holmes and Josh Jackson always did their best work with each other.My opinion of Kevin Williamson rose in that, even after not having seen the show for four years and originally planning a Dawson-Joey ending, he was able to step back and really look at the dynamics between the two pairings and realize the difference between friendship love and romantic love.As for the fate of our Capeside characters overall, Jen's death was of course sad, but I think Michelle Williams hit it out of the ballpark and it was a catalyst for the others to re-evaluate their lives. On the DVD, I loved seeing Andie (Meredith Monroe) come back and have a chat with Pacey, that was a lovely scene! It was great for Jack and Doug to have a happy ending and take care of little Amy. And I don't think Dawson is short changed, he got what he really always wanted: to tell the story he wanted to tell as a successful filmmaker. All in all, the Series Finale rectified, for me, a lot of wrong turns made in the series (see Coda from Season 4 and everything until Season 6's Clean and Sober) and so I could say goodbye to this group of friends and feel good about it.",5,"An Unexpected, Satisfying Ending that re-validates the show",1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,2607,"['watched', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'sporadically', 'original', 'run', ""'ve"", 'now', 'DVD', 'main', 'thing', 'always', 'drew', 'was', 'romance', 'Pacey', 'Joey', 'stopped', 'watching', 'fourth', 'season', 'could', 'see', 'writers', 'were', 'contriving', 'throw', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'back', 'together', 'fact', 'Pacey/Joey', 'relationship', 'was', 'pure', 'magic', 'Seasons', '3/4', 'tuned', 'Finale', 'just', 'curiousity', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'writers', 'reverse', 'course', 'have', 'Joey', 'choose', 'Pacey', 'was', 'awesome', 'ending', 'especially', 'viewing', 'Finale', 'DVD', 'extended', 'scenes', 'commentary.I', 'just', 'never', 'saw', 'anything', 'remotely', 'romantic', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'just', 'friendship', 'stuck', 'back', 'childhood', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'unhealthy', 'Conversely', 'Pacey', 'Joey', 'had', 'real', 'adult', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'could', 'be', 'woman', 'not', 'girl', 'down', 'creek', 'Dawson', 'always', 'saw', 'difference', 'why', 'could', 'never', 'work', 'out', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'kept', 'confusing', 'friendship', 'romantic', 'love', 'was', 'safe', 'route', 'go', 'Pacey', 'made', 'Joey', 'feel', 'alive', 'own', 'words', 'People', 'say', 'Dawson', 'Joey', 'had', 'type', 'epic', 'relationship', 'saw', 'buds', 'Pacey', 'Joey', 'romance', 'way', 'back', 'Season', '1', 'Season', '3', 'were', 'together', 'not', 'everytime', 'were', 'other', 'presence', 'air', 'sizzled', 'Katie', 'Holmes', 'Josh', 'Jackson', 'always', 'did', 'best', 'work', 'other.My', 'opinion', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'rose', 'even', 'not', 'having', 'seen', 'show', 'four', 'years', 'originally', 'planning', 'Dawson-Joey', 'ending', 'was', 'able', 'step', 'back', 'really', 'look', 'dynamics', 'two', 'pairings', 'realize', 'difference', 'friendship', 'love', 'romantic', 'love.As', 'fate', 'Capeside', 'characters', 'overall', 'Jen', 'death', 'was', 'course', 'sad', 'think', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'hit', 'ballpark', 'was', 'catalyst', 'others', 're-evaluate', 'lives', 'DVD', 'loved', 'seeing', 'Andie', 'Meredith', 'Monroe', 'come', 'back', 'have', 'chat', 'Pacey', 'was', 'lovely', 'scene', 'was', 'great', 'Jack', 'Doug', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'take', 'care', 'little', 'Amy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Dawson', 'short', 'changed', 'got', 'what', 'really', 'always', 'wanted', 'tell', 'story', 'wanted', 'tell', 'successful', 'filmmaker', 'Series', 'Finale', 'rectified', 'lot', 'wrong', 'turns', 'made', 'series', 'see', 'Coda', 'Season', '4', 'everything', 'Season', '6', 'Clean', 'Sober', 'so', 'could', 'say', 'goodbye', 'group', 'friends', 'feel', 'good']",N/A
768021,A1LF5XT1MOUFEZ,B0000AUHQ9,"Martin Miller ""marty party""","[7, 14]","I bought this DVD the day that it came out, and I must say that as far as the extended scenes go I was not dissapointed. When the show aired origionally it was only 88 minutes in length.  With all of the scenes that have been added to the DVD version it totals a running time of 104 minutes. Now the most of the scenes are just extended version of some of the scenes aired on the WB, but there are some real gems here. One of these being the return of Andie. Now granted she is not in much, but she is in enough to make her presance felt, which alone is worth the purchase of this DVD. The Commentary is excellent as well. Kevin Williams explains why he put Joey and Pacey together, which still didn't make much sense to me, but because of circumstances involving Marideth Monroe's (Andie) shooting schedule and other circumstances the only way the show could have ended somewhat  happily would have been by putting Pacey and Joey together.  He also explains that the original script was shot to have Dawson and Joey together which was his origional intention (which is some consilation for Dawson and Joey fans).  This is very clear by some of the scenes that were included on this DVD. It was not until the very last minute that he changed his mind about the script (which in my humble opinion stinks). The Other deleted scenes included from the Origional Pilot airing pretty much stink to be honest.  They are just different versions of the scenes that can be seen in the first episode.  One being with a different actor (who isn't that good) playing Dawsons Dad. If Kevin Williams really wanted to impress the fans he would have included somehow the Joey Dawson Ending, even if it wasn't filmed.  Him reading the origional script would have worked.Now with all that said the actual episode, I must admit that was content with it, but not happy. For starters the love triangle, Pacey, Joey, and Dawson. This love triangle was something that we all thought had been resolved by Season 5 where there was little interaction between Pacey and Joey of a romantic nature at all, but alas the writers at the end of Season 6  decided to jerk us back into the familiar scenerio.  Well I didn't buy it. I watched every singele episode of Dawsons creek and I don't care how or what you do, PACEY AND JOEY MAKE LITTLE TO NO SENSE AT ALL!!! I mean the writers and producers dragged the fans of the show on for years making us want Joey and Dawson to finally get a good shot together, which they never got. Instead they were just a one nite stand/soul-mates to each other which really stinks.  Now the ""weakest"" moment of the finale' came during Joey's monolgue that she gave to Pacey regaurding their love. Saying that it had kept her running. Anyone who has seen this show for more than two seasons knows much much better than that. That would be DAWSON that kept her running, not Pacey. It seems to me that someone probably just kept the dialogue that was intended for the Dawson/Joey ending in and just changed the person she was talking to to Pacey instead of Dawson. It just didn't make a whole lot of sense.  So basically I don't think the love triangle was resolved at all.Now on to the bright sides of this finale, the characters of Jenn and Jack were done justice. Even tho it was very said to see Jenn die, it was her fate. Jenn lived her life to her fullest and experienced more in her short time than some of us will in a lifetime, and she did have a cute baby. However my one problem with that is there is no mention of the father or of what happened between her and her boyfriend CJ. Jack had a nice life as a teacher in Capeside and his love interest Deputy Doug, which about killed me. I laughed so hard!Now Dawson, the character who was done the least justice. Big Whoop he got to meet Spealburg....he ends up alone, just like his idol Mr. Brooks. I mean would it have been that hard to dig up someone for Dawson? I mean heck Andie, Gretchen, Audrey, or even someone new? But, to leave him alone was a great injustice to his character. Granted he has Joey as a ""soul-mate,"" but I mean really what does that count for? Very little.......I must say that the finale had it's moments and the choice of music was touching, but the fact that this takes place 5 years down the road made some story lines end abruptly (IE CJ/Jen), and it really didn't give us any logical reason why Pacey and Joey should be together. So in short, if your a Dawson's Creek fan in the least, the finale (the exntended cut) is a must have.  The Extended Footage, all be it sometimes more confusing than the origional, is definatly worth putting out the money, and for Joey/Dawson fans it is a inside to why the ending that did make the most sense, was not the logical choice for the director/producers/writers (watch the commentary).",3,A Ending you can be,1063497600,"09 14, 2003",2003,4813,"['bought', 'DVD', 'day', 'came', 'out', 'must',

The extra scenes complete the story and the commentaries from Kevin Williamson truly explain the reasons behind the ending. Also, the reason behind Pacey not ending up with Andie was not because the actress playing her was not available. Having them end up together would have been ridiculous considering they hadn't seen each other in years and were not the kids they used to be. It would've seemed like a consolation prize for Pacey, which he certainly did not deserve.Having watched the re-runs on TBS, there's no question in my mind that the true romantic and hero of the series was not Dawson but Pacey. Pacey was longing for love, Dawson was longing for a ""Hollywood"" love. Thinking back and comparing Dawson vs. Pacey and what they did to demonstrate how much they cared for Joey, Pacey wins hands down. There's a particular episode when Pacey and Joey get locked up in a K-Mart for a night that perfectly exemplifies the kind of chemistry the two characters had (also, it's pretty obvious Katie Holmes smiles more in scenes with Jashua Jackson than with James Van Der Beek). If that episode had been Joey and Dawson stuck together, we would have expected no reminiscing of happier times (because there are so few!) and a stupid fight that would end in separate sleeping bags.Dawson was so insecure about Joey, the only way they could end up together was in his series ""The Creek"" as part of his own imagination.Who fought a school bully for Joey and then bought her a wall to paint on? Who took Joey sailing down the coast? Who waited patiently for Joey to open up sexually? The reason it wasn't Dawson was because he would not dare change anything.
