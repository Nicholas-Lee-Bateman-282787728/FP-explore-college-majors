1284169,A3NZ2W6O0DJFQ6,B002QVZV9Q,Linda D. Alexander,"[8, 8]","The movie ""Set Apart"" was a wonderful and insightful journey of teenagers navigating the waters of adulthood. There are many pressures that are present for teens today that no other generation in America has faced. They have many different decisions to make and they must be made definitively and oftentimes quickly. A wrong decision can negatively impact the remainder of their lives. Enter a real live group that extends a ""life line"" to young people at risk. They offer a haven, a retreat, to sort out some of the world's demands while in a safe environment. It is a story of inspiration and defeat of negativity...a rise of righteousness that must be applauded.",5,Motivating Movie with Youth Oriented Themes,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,665,"['movie', 'Set', 'Apart', 'was', 'wonderful', 'insightful', 'journey', 'teenagers', 'navigating', 'waters', 'adulthood', 'are', 'many', 'pressures', 'are', 'present', 'teens', 'today', 'other', 'generation', 'America', 'faced', 'have', 'many', 'different', 'decisions', 'make', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'definitively', 'oftentimes', 'quickly', 'wrong', 'decision', 'can', 'negatively', 'impact', 'remainder', 'lives', 'Enter', 'real', 'live', 'group', 'life', 'line', 'young', 'people', 'risk', 'offer', 'haven', 'retreat', 'sort', 'out', 'world', 'demands', 'safe', 'environment', 'story', 'inspiration', 'defeat', 'negativity', 'rise', 'righteousness', 'must', 'be', 'applauded']",Set Apart

I've worked with the homeless and those with addictions for several years and the majority of them have some horrendous stories from growing up (not all, but many).  This is a Christian based film that shows how to walk out our faith and let God do the transformation.I purchased this film after I bought it.  This is a great movie for the whole family and would be great for a youth group to watch.  I'm sure some interesting discussions would be opened up.",5,Great Movie/Great Life Lessons,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,617,"['so', 'much', 'truth', 'story', 'line', 'film', 'wonder', 'why', 'have', 'so', 'few', 'programs', 'country', 'implement', 'strategies', 'used', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'homeless', 'addictions', 'several', 'years', 'majority', 'have', 'horrendous', 'stories', 'growing', 'up', 'not', 'many', 'Christian', 'based', 'film', 'how', 'walk', 'out', 'faith', 'let', 'God', 'do', 'transformation.I', 'purchased', 'film', 'bought', 'great', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'youth', 'group', 'watch', ""'m"", 'sure', 'interesting', 'discussions', 'would', 'be', 'opened', 'up']",Set Apart

It is more about &#34;living it everyday&#34; kind of thing.  The acting by everyone is not the best but the story line is WONDERFUL and UPLIFTING and GIVE YOU HOPE for the future.Kind of a western type -slightly yet kind of country too.  LOVED the music also.I HIGHLY recommend this film.,5,Great  UPLIFTING movie.,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,403,"['watched', 'last', 'night', 'husband', 'i', 'LOVED', 'movie.This', 'not', 'IN', 'YOUR', 'FACE', 'religious', 'movie', 'more', '34', 'living', 'everyday', '34', 'kind', 'thing', 'acting', 'everyone', 'not', 'best', 'story', 'line', 'WONDERFUL', 'UPLIFTING', 'GIVE', 'YOU', 'HOPE', 'future.Kind', 'western', 'type', '-slightly', 'yet', 'kind', 'country', 'too', 'LOVED', 'music', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'film']",Set Apart
