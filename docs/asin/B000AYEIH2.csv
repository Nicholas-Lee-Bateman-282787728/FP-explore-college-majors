934718,AKSLB6MNICD9K,B000AYEIH2,"Amazon Customer ""INLOVEWITHLIFE""","[5, 5]",After reading the director's review I must state my opinion.  I feel this movie is for people who are creative and open minded.  Most people can't see past what they normally see every day. This movie does not have the basic everyday romantic story line. I feel this movie is very deep and it makes you think about love and life on another level. I look at it as a personal diary of love and heartbreak unfolding before your eyes.  It tells a really good story filled with emotion.  I am very glad that I purchased this movie.  I feel I am a very creative and artistic person so I can appreciate a movie like this.  I think it is something you have to see more than once to really understand and grasp the nature behind the character.  I think you should give this movie a chance.  I really enjoyed it!,5,I enjoyed this movie!,1184889600,"07 20, 2007",2007,802,"['reading', 'director', 'review', 'must', 'state', 'opinion', 'feel', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'creative', 'open', 'minded', 'Most', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'past', 'what', 'normally', 'see', 'day', 'movie', 'not', 'have', 'basic', 'everyday', 'romantic', 'story', 'line', 'feel', 'movie', 'very', 'deep', 'think', 'love', 'life', 'level', 'look', 'personal', 'diary', 'love', 'heartbreak', 'unfolding', 'eyes', 'really', 'good', 'story', 'filled', 'emotion', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'purchased', 'movie', 'feel', 'am', 'very', 'creative', 'artistic', 'person', 'can', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'think', 'something', 'have', 'see', 'more', 'once', 'really', 'understand', 'grasp', 'nature', 'character', 'think', 'should', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'really', 'enjoyed']",Strange as Angels

The main character meets a guy she likes but in the end he does not seem to be the one for her....she goes on a seach to do more self exploration.  The scenes with her friend and mother went by and there was some film lacking.,2,2 1/2,1163980800,"11 20, 2006",2006,311,"['was', 'not', 'impressed', 'pace', 'film', 'end', 'i', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'main', 'character', 'guy', 'end', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'one', '.she', 'seach', 'do', 'more', 'self', 'exploration', 'scenes', 'friend', 'mother', 'went', 'was', 'film', 'lacking']",Strange as Angels

934723,A3P7R0L2TTL7QB,B000AYEIH2,tkay,"[8, 10]","I bought this movie because I just absolutely fell in love with Christian Payton after seeing him in ""The Temptations."" I wanted to see more of him but this movie was very disappointing. The script was poorly written and the movie had no direction. It was just aimless and went nowhere. I kept waiting for it to get better but it just didn't. It's been described as being 'funny' but I don't recall laughing at all. And what a horrible ending! This movie just didn't make any sense. A young woman (Marilyn) wants to leave town to add some zest to her lackluster life but changes her mind after meeting Rodney (Christian Payton). They hit it off, start kicking it, then he has sex with his ex-wife for no reason, they break up, get back together, have some reconciliation sex, and she ends up leaving anyway. In the make-up sex scene Marilyn said, during the thrusts of passion, that she would not leave town and that she would stay. Next thing you know she's getting on a plane. Whack.I gave it 2 stars because Christian Payton is so fine and he did a good job acting. The Marilyn character could not act. None of the other actors moved me actually. Marilyn's mother couldn't act, her friend Lena's acting was okay but she had to roll her neck every time she said something. And the sex scenes were just awful. Who doesn't like to paint right before making love? I know that always gets me in the mood. And how many adults do you know who still have sex in the basement while their mom is upstairs? Get a room.And the dialogue was just terrible. Words of wisdom were tossed out at inappropriate times, some of the conversations were too deep for two people who just met. Someone would say something with meaning, then next thing you know here comes somebody with something stupid to say. For every good statement made, there were 2 stupid ones that followed. The movie had a few moments but it's not worth purchasing. Rent it first then decide whether you want to add it to your collection or not.I hope Christian will be offered better roles in the future. He is an excellent actor and it was embarrassing to see his talents wasted on this garbage. I still love Christian and I hope to see him in a good movie next time. I also hope he'll get another role that showcases his vocals because he can sing. That's his voice on ""Oh, Mother"" and ""For Once In My Life"" in ""The Temptations."" It's okay Christian. Some of the best ones have made some stinkers. Even Jamie Foxx did ""Booty Call"" and look at what he accomplished! There's hope! Still a Christian Payton fan...",2,I totally agree with Monie Love from Detroit....,1164240000,"11 23, 2006",2006,2565,"['bought', 'movie', 'just', 'absolutely', 'fell', 'love', 'Christian', 'Payton', 'seeing', 'Temptations', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'script', 'was', 'poorly', 'written', 'movie', 'had', 'direction', 'was', 'just', 'aimless', 'went', 'nowhere', 'kept', 'waiting', 'get', 'better', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'been', 'described', 'being', ""'funny"", 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'laughing', 'what', 'horrible', 'ending', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'young', 'woman', 'Marilyn', 'leave', 'town', 'add', 'zest', 'lackluster', 'life', 'mind', 'meeting', 'Rodney', 'Christian', 'Payton', 'hit', 'off', 'start', 'kicking', 'then', 'sex', 'ex-wife', 'reason', 'break', 'up', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'have', 'reconciliation', 'sex', 'up', 'leaving', 'anyway', 'make-up', 'sex', 'scene', 'Marilyn', 'said', 'thrusts', 'passion', 'would', 'not', 'leave', 'town', 'would', 'stay', 'Next', 'thing', 'know', 'getting', 'plane', 'Whack.I', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'Christian', 'Payton', 'so', 'fine', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'Marilyn', 'character', 'could', 'not', 'act', 'None', 'other', 'actors', 'moved', 'actually', 'Marilyn', 'mother', 'could', ""n't"", 'act', 'friend', 'Lena', 'acting', 'was', 'okay', 'had', 'roll', 'neck', 'time', 'said', 'something', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'awful', 'Who', ""n't"", 'like', 'paint', 'right', 'making', 'love', 'know', 'always', 'mood', 'how', 'many', 'adults', 'do', 'know', 'who', 'still', 'have', 'sex', 'basement', 'mom', 'upstairs', 'Get', 'room.And', 'dialogue', 'was', 'just', 'terrible', 'Words', 'wisdom', 'were', 'tossed', 'out', 'inappropriate', 'times', 'conversations', 'were', 'too', 'deep', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'met', 'Someone', 'would', 'say', 'something', 'meaning', 'then', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'here', 'somebody', 'something', 'stupid', 'say', 'good', 'statement', 'made', 'were', '2', 'stupid', 'ones', 'followed', 'movie', 'had', 'few', 'moments', 'not', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'Rent', 'first', 'then', 'decide', 'want', 'add', 'collection', 'not.I', 'hope', 'Christian', 'will', 'be', 'offered', 'better', 'roles', 'future', 'excellent', 'actor', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'see', 'talents', 'wasted', 'garbage', 'still', 'love', 'Christian', 'hope', 'see', 'good', 'movie', 'next', 'time', 'also', 'hope', ""'ll"", 'get', 'role', 'vocals', 'can', 'sing', 'voice', 'Oh', 'Mother', 'Once', 'My', 'Life', 'Temptations', 'okay', 'Christian', 'best', 'ones', 'have', 'made', 'stinkers', 'Even', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'did', 'Booty', 'Call', 'look', 'what', 'accomplished', 'hope', 'Still', 'Christian', 'Payton', 'fan']",Strange as Angels
