823216,A3KG6HYQMUGECB,B00023P4B0,Anna,"[10, 15]","These guys have been playing basically the same songs for the last twenty years.  But they still look like they're having fun (unlike  the Stones and other bands that should have retired long ago) and put on a great show. Fleetwood and Buckingham are the best in the business, bar none.  The rendition of ""Tusk"" that they give here is dynamite; I love the happy faces that Fleetwood makes when he plays because those are the same faces I make when I listen to him. And Lindsey going nuts, jumping and dancing around like a loon was priceless.I give four stars only because of this: I accidentally put in Disc Two before Disc One and was too lazy to get up and change discs.  Disc Two was just so freaking awesome that Disc One was a little disappointing.  But I still watch it - just not as much as the second part of the concert.I don't care if they're still touring when they're in walkers.  If they keep putting on shows like this, I'll keep showing up.

823217,A1JBPRTOJRE2SC,B00023P4B0,anthemic,"[68, 72]","I am a diehard Fleetwood Mac fan who attended five concerts in Australia and watched this DVD three times over 96 hours. Despite my fanatical tendencies, I can still be critically objective about Fleetwood Mac.I am ambivalent about this DVD at best. One the one hand, it is great to have a DVD recording from the current tour. It allows you to relive the concert and to reconnect with idiosyncracies such as the boxing sequence in 'Tusk', to Stevie's 'Say You Will' dance, and Mick's drum solo. There are beautiful moments captured from the acoustic delicacies of 'Say Goodbye' to the epic 'I'm So Afraid' or the spellbinding 'Gold Dust Woman'. Musically speaking - whether you attended a concert or not - you will enjoy the music. Not only is the music superb but the performances are great. Some fans will miss Christine but they should also look at it as an opportunity for the band to head in a different creative direction - and therefore offer us something different as well.Lindsey is the most active member of the band in this concert. You really get the sense that it's his moment to take center stage. The dialogue between Stevie and Lindsey (whether staged or not) really comes through. The sound and lighting is stunning.The problem remains in the visual presentation of the concert. I found it alienating and and lacking in emotion. For starters, the editing is too rapid. This makes the concert's pace very snappy. That pace is fine for faster songs but Fleetwood Mac songs are often hypnotic and packed with emotional fibre - that a camera shot would be better to sit and pause for a while to capture that emotion. The film does not know when to be still. Compare any song to 'Silver Springs' from 'The Dance' DVD and look at how the camera sits on Stevie for a while before cutting away to a different band member. In short, the editing is not always appropriate and doesn't allow the audience to engage with the emotion as much as it could.Secondly, there are too many long shots which creates further alienation between the band and the viewer. Again, this is an editing issue. The idea of a film concert is to bring the viewer closer to the band. It is awful to have Stevie sing a slow song only to cut to a long shot from the back of the Fleet Center. Nicks' fans will hate the fact that you hardly see close-ups of Stevie's face. That may have been a conscious choice on her part but that adds to the alienation as well.Therein lies my ambivalence: I cherished the DVD because the music is superb but I was disappointed by the visual presentation. I don't mind rapid editing but I think it should be appropriate for the song. Hopefully one day, it will be re-edited. In the meantime, I'll listen to the DVD rather than watch it. That said, it's still a worthwhile purchase.",3,Superb music but flawed presentation,1088899200,"07 4, 2004",2004,2794,"['am', 'diehard', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'fan', 'who', 'attended', 'five', 'concerts', 'Australia', 'watched', 'DVD', 'three', 'times', '96', 'hours', 'fanatical', 'tendencies', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'critically', 'objective', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac.I', 'am', 'ambivalent', 'DVD', 'best', 'One', 'one', 'hand', 'great', 'have', 'DVD', 'recording', 'current', 'tour', 'relive', 'concert', 'reconnect', 'idiosyncracies', 'such', 'boxing', 'sequence', ""'Tusk"", 'Stevie', ""'Say"", 'Will', 'dance', 'Mick', 'drum', 'solo', 'are', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'captured', 'acoustic', 'delicacies', ""'Say"", 'Goodbye', 'epic', ""'m"", 'So', 'Afraid', 'spellbinding', ""'Gold"", 'Dust', 'Woman', 'Musically', 'speaking', 'attended', 'concert', 'not', 'will', 'enjoy', 'music', 'Not', 'only', 'music', 'superb', 'performances', 'are', 'great', 'fans', 'will', 'miss', 'Christine', 'should', 'also', 'look', 'opportunity', 'band', 'head', 'different', 'creative', 'direction', 'therefore', 'offer', 'something', 'different', 'well.Lindsey', 'most', 'active', 'member', 'band', 'concert', 'really', 'get', 'sense', 'moment', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'dialogue', 'Stevie', 'Lindsey', 'staged', 'not', 'really', 'sound', 'lighting', 'stunning.The', 'problem', 'visual', 'presentation', 'concert', 'found', 'alienating', 'lacking', 'emotion', 'starters', 'editing', 'too', 'rapid', 'concert', 'pace', 'very', 'snappy', 'pace', 'fine', 'faster', 'songs', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'songs', 'are', 'often', 'hypnotic', 'packed', 'emotional', 'fibre', 'camera', 'shot', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'sit', 'pause', 'while', 'capture', 'emotion', 'film', 'not', 'know', 'when', 'be', 'still', 'Compare', 'song', ""'Silver"", 'Springs', ""'The"", 'Dance', 'DVD', 'look', 'how', 'camera', 'Stevie', 'while', 'cutting', 'away', 'different', 'band', 'member', 'short', 'editing', 'not', 'always', 'appropriate', ""n't"", 'allow', 'audience', 'engage', 'emotion', 'as', 'much', 'could.Secondly', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'long', 'shots', 'further', 'alienation', 'band', 'viewer', 'Again', 'editing', 'issue', 'idea', 'film', 'concert', 'bring', 'viewer', 'closer', 'band', 'awful', 'have', 'Stevie', 'sing', 'slow', 'song', 'only', 'cut', 'long', 'shot', 'back', 'Fleet', 'Center', 'Nicks', 'fans', 'will', 'hate', 'fact', 'hardly', 'see', 'close-ups', 'Stevie', 'face', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'conscious', 'choice', 'part', 'alienation', 'well.Therein', 'ambivalence', 'cherished', 'DVD', 'music', 'superb', 'was', 'disappointed', 'visual', 'presentation', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'rapid', 'editing', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'appropriate', 'song', 'Hopefully', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'be', 're-edited', 'meantime', ""'ll"", 'listen', 'DVD', 'rather', 'watch', 'said', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'purchase']",Fleetwood Mac - Live in Boston

I can't say if it was because of all the infighting, or all the drugs, but they seem to be always one step away from being completely great. I'm sure all know the story about the Tusk album costing $1 million dollars in production costs, resulting a $19.99 retail price upon release. (I guess it's the record buyer who has to pay for all the drugs.) And even when they performed live, Fleetwood Mac seemed to never get it right. Too remote. Too aloof. Too weird. However, with this release, the band shows what they can really do. Accomplished musicianship, not to mention an solid rapport with their audience, makes this performance a keeper.

823223,AMDZA4HZ9FG86,B00023P4B0,"Chris McLeod ""&#34;Never have I been a blue c...","[56, 56]","I am a huge and passionate Fleetwood Mac fan. I was lucky enough to see this last 'Say You Will Tour' 6 times throughout 2003 and 2004. My last concert being May 23, 2004 in Jacksonville, FL. where  I had the great opportunity of being front row, and interacting with the band (playing Lindsey's guitar and much more)- technically I actually had 3rd row tickets, but security let the first 4 rows move up front and stand at the stage.I was greatly anticipating the release of this DVD set. I purchased it on the day of its release, and  I still love it..in fact I actually watched it about an hour ago.I will start off with what I love about this DVD, and later get into what I do not love.First off it's just great to have a new DVD since the Dance video. It's also great to have a video filmed from an actual concert, compared to the Dance when the crowd was invite only.Lindsey Buckingham is portrayed best here, and his wildness on stage is really shown. I felt it at the concerts and I could feel it watching this DVD as well. He has proved himself to be a musical genius. You really get a sense while watching what he's actually like in concert.Stevie Nicks, through all her criticisms that every video performance receives her...shines. She has always been deeply scrutinized, especially when performing live. Some fans and especially critics have it in their heads that this 56 year old woman (55 when this was taped) should be EXACTLY like she was in 1975 screaming her vocal chords out to RHIANNON.. I guess you would like her to still be on drugs as well??Anyway...'Say Goodbye' is one of the highlights of the DVD. It is a new song from their SAY YOU WILL CD, and this live performance is much better than the album version. The way they perform it live, is somewhat slower than the album version. Stevie's voice is so delicate in this song, and this is one of the intense moments of the set.'Beautiful Child' has been one of the highlights of this tour. Never performed live until this current tour, it is truly a delight to hear. Stevie Nicks sings this tune with such intensity , while watching you feel like you are sitting in her home watching her sing it for the first time.Stevie gives her trademark ""GOLD DUST WOMAN"" scream, and wears her trademark gold shawl.  She even breaks out her cream colored high heeled platform boots of days gone by for GYPSY.""Come"" another song from SAY YOU WILL, really shines on this DVD as well. Although Lindsey doesn't play a whole lot of guitar in this song, he focuses much more on his crazed screaming and intense flirting with the ladies in the front row. The backing band really deserves credit for the incredible music in this song. Carlos Rios, and Neale Heywood play some incredible and hard pounding electric guitars in this one.  While Mick's drumming is great, Steve Rinkov's backing drumming is what makes this particular song. Also we cannot forget ""the backbone of Fleetwood Mac"" John McVie on bass, which is very prominent in ""COME.""Another highlight is Stevie Nicks' solo hit ""STAND BACK."" I have been reading the reviews her, and I too think her performance was superb. It is a moment within the show that really allows Stevie to rock out. Many of her Fleetwood Mac tunes are not what one would call ""upbeat"" songs, so this solo addition to the site really adds a lot to the show. You get to see her do her classic twirls, here. During Stand Back she probably twirls about 10 consecutive times, gives a few kicks and does all that famous dancing Stevie Nicks is known for, love it or hate it!Stevie dedicates ""LANDSLIDE"" to her former lover and band-mate Lindsey Buckingham, and she performs a memorable rendition of this classic.""TUSK"" is another musical performance which the backing band deserves much credit. This is another tune which Lindsey plays little guitar, opting for another crazed vocal and stage performance instead. The USC Marching band is not here, but their horns are nicely sampled in via today's new technology. A video of the USC Marching Band is also shown in the background during the song. You get to watch Lindsey yell ""TUSK"" ""TUSK"" and then chase Stevie Nicks around the stage as they perform a mock boxing match.Now, my disappointments with this set. The editing, the editing, the editing is all that needs to be said. This show was filmed over two consecutive nights - Sept 23 (with an invite/winners only crowd of 1000 lucky fans) for closeup purposes as well as audio, as well as the actual concert on Sept 24 - both at the Fleet Center.  This is all fine and dandy, except those who edited failed to do a great job in putting this all together. Once in ""RHIANNON"" Stevie's vocal continues for about 1 sec after her face is away from the mic. This is a problem caused by filming over two nights, and not watching little mistakes like that.I agree with a previous reviewer that there is too much camera cutting in certain songs, that are not even fast songs. In slow songs the camera should be a little more ""Steady"" and focus on one thing, rather than jumping all over the stage. It makes it have a much less intimate feel. I agree also that there is not much point in all the long distance shots. We KNOW they draw a huge crowd of 20,000 + and a couple of nice crowds shots would have done it. It seems as if the editers wanted to remind everyone of the size of the crowd, except in THE MIDDLE OF SONGS.The sound is great, except sometimes it seems to fluctuate. In slow songs like ""SAY GOODBYE"" Lindsey's guitar seems to get louder in some parts, where it really doesn't do that in the actual concert. I feel the need to turn the tv down a little in certain parts. However, overall the audio mixing is great and the sound is pretty tight.Another little problem I have is this being 2 DVD's. Certainly it could have all fit on one DVD, as did the Dance video which still had superb quality (I would say a little better quality than  this DVD)..Was the purpose so the price could be jacked up? Well, I dunno that's for everyone to decide. Regardless, it's pointless for this to be a 2DVD set...it kind of interrupts the show if you are watching the concert in its entirety to have to change discs in the middle.Overall I was quite satisfied with this DVD. I strongly recommend it to those who love this great band. It has it's technical problems, but the band is superb. The sound is incredible for the most part, the video is the only rough part at times. The packaging is nice...although most of the pictures in the booklet are not actually from THIS particular concert, that's ok.  I would say even without Christine McVie, Fleetwood Mac managed to really shine. This tour was the 3rd highest grossing tour of 2003, and there's a reason.

I was lucky enough to attend one of the Mac's concerts when they were down in Australia this year and am over the moon that this nigh on re-creates that fantastic night for me.The clarity and sound on this DVD are exceptional and they capture Fleetwood Mac, live and raw like never before. I have looked back at my other Mac concerts (from Mirage, Tango & The Dance) and the energy of 'Live in Boston' is double any of these previous concerts. The star of the show is Lindsey Buckingham, who breathes new life into many of his older songs (Eyes of the World, Second Hand News) but also displays blistering rage on guitar that would put most of his younger counterparts to shame, especially on Come. However his best performance is on the spare, lovely ballad Say Goodbye, as he finally lays to rest the remnants of his love affair with Stevie Nicks. As for the delightful Ms Nicks, while she is overshadowed slightly by Buckingham, she nevertheless produces her own highlights on the rarely performed Beautiful Child, the now concert-staple Silver Springs and particularly on a rocking version of her solo hit, Stand Back, where her voice is as strong as ever and by the middle of it, she is whirling like a dervish. And of the great rhythm section that lend their name to this band, Mick Fleetwood is as mad as ever and goes completely bonkers on World Turning while John McVie stands in the shadows, dependable as ever on bass but still thrilling with his ""monsters are coming"" bass line from The Chain.This is a must-own DVD for both Mac fans and music fans - a truly stellar concert that long lives on my DVD player.",5,Stunning Mac,1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,1656,"['words', 'Kate', 'Bush', 'Wow', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'attend', 'one', 'Mac', 'concerts', 'when', 'were', 'down', 'Australia', 'year', 'am', 'moon', 'nigh', 're-creates', 'fantastic', 'night', 'me.The', 'clarity', 'sound', 'DVD', 'are', 'exceptional', 'capture', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'live', 'raw', 'never', 'have', 'looked', 'back', 'other', 'Mac', 'concerts', 'Mirage', 'Tango', 'Dance', 'energy', ""'Live"", 'Boston', 'double', 'previous', 'concerts', 'star', 'show', 'Lindsey', 'Buckingham', 'who', 'new', 'life', 'many', 'older', 'songs', 'Eyes', 'World', 'Second', 'Hand', 'News', 'also', 'blistering', 'rage', 'guitar', 'would', 'put', 'most', 'younger', 'counterparts', 'shame', 'especially', 'Come', 'However', 'best', 'performance', 'spare', 'lovely', 'ballad', 'Say', 'Goodbye', 'finally', 'rest', 'remnants', 'love', 'affair', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'delightful', 'Ms', 'Nicks', 'overshadowed', 'slightly', 'Buckingham', 'nevertheless', 'own', 'highlights', 'rarely', 'performed', 'Beautiful', 'Child', 'now', 'concert-staple', 'Silver', 'Springs', 'particularly', 'rocking', 'version', 'solo', 'hit', 'Stand', 'Back', 'where', 'voice', 'as', 'strong', 'ever', 'middle', 'whirling', 'dervish', 'great', 'rhythm', 'section', 'lend', 'name', 'band', 'Mick', 'Fleetwood', 'as', 'mad', 'ever', 'completely', 'bonkers', 'World', 'Turning', 'John', 'McVie', 'shadows', 'dependable', 'ever', 'bass', 'still', 'thrilling', 'monsters', 'are', 'coming', 'bass', 'line', 'Chain.This', 'must-own', 'DVD', 'Mac', 'fans', 'music', 'fans', 'truly', 'stellar', 'concert', 'long', 'lives', 'DVD', 'player']",Fleetwood Mac - Live in Boston

And State Fairs, indeed, are where this group ought to be playing; right next to Whitesnake and Rick Springfield and the demolition derby and blue ribbon goats.Buckingham gets his ya-yas out a couple times on lead guitar, but other than that, the ladies sound old, the bass player John just stands there (like he has for his entire career). Christine still looks youthful; an unsung MaryAnne next to Stevie's more often photographed Ginger. Christine remains a comely British school marm ready to spank your wrists for looking up her skirt, so that's one redeeming feature. Yet that small pleasure is offset by Mick's still googly eyes and the 1980s vest. Thanks for putting a camera right by Mick so that I can get scared out of my easy chair every time he stares those cue balls at the camera; nice touch for Halloween.I wish I could say that Fleetwood Mac are rockers, but alas, they are little more than Lawrence Welk on steroids. Sure, Don't Stop pushes the metronome to 40 mph from Fleetwood Mac's usual school zone 20 mph pace, but seriously rip-snortin' rock and roll this just ain't, brothers and sisters. No matter how much Dolby 5.1 Surround and DVD fog-filtered quality you throw at this show, the music remains elevator quality drivel.

He looks gray and almost grim loosing his youthful charisma that we saw last in the Chain.Nevertheless, I was pulled right into the obvious sweat and toil they exhibited on stage.  Everyone is trying their hardest to entertain.  They're not technically perfect but it works to their advantage.  The entire show exhibits raw energy.  Lindsey is doing everything he can with the electric guitar and Mick Fleetwood pours on the drums like he's eighteen.  There is a lot of commentary that without Christie McVie their is no band.  I have always enjoyed Christie's toe-tapping stanzas but that's all she gave.  She provided no layers to the songs.  They felt like bubblegum 80's pop.  Lindsey on the other hand is pushing envelopes and trying and experimenting and it grabs you.  Most of his music forces you to hear it a few times to absorb it all.  That to me is true Rock and Roll.  Paul Simon often forced you to do the same thing.

I will share, those unintrested, can skip, perhaps we were unique, because I was in a band, but our friends that used to attend our weekly parties surely have fond memories of the Mac.I was 15-16 when Rumors came out, and the memories of Saturday nights, heading down to the Beer Distributor (Rumors blaring all the way there and back), buying the avg. 6-8 cases of beer (per person :), heading back to the house, kicking off the weekly Party with 30-50 of our closest friends, and continuing the party playing much of all their music in the weekly Jam session, (yea, along with CSN&Y; Southern man, Skinnards Freebird, Black Sabbath, YES) were great memorys, and loss of many brain cells :) It was ALWAYS the Fleetwood Mac songs that everyone would cram in to the room where I was playing Drums, Jon on Lead Guitar, Bill on Base guitar, any of many we could get to pick up keyboards... and this was weekly for about 2 years!)Now at 42, I saw ""The Dance"" DVD at a friends party. He had it playing on 2 wide screen TV's and a great sound system. That was it. The start of building a home theater to play that disc! 50"" & 42"" plasma later, 800 watts of Amplification at 7.1, fully digital and minus about $15K, it is mind blowing.  It brings back such great memories (The ones I remember :),the Gas shortage, Paper shortage, Penny shortage, but no good music shortage.  In the 90's they dubbed the 70's era music, verses the 60's music revolution of the beatles as a ""Dead music Era"". WHAT??? Come along the next century, now you see people with bell bottoms, those 70's Jordache bells that were $60 then are $160 now.  Fleetwood Mac was a huge part of the 70's sound.  The Dance is hard to beat as far as capturing a decades old band in high quality video and audio, and the Boston Concert DVD does not make it.Time. Age. But it is just another part of the few bands that were staples of the 60-70's.  Where the 70's bands referred to Influences from 50's and 60th's, many current bands reflect and poing out 70's bands that were their influencers.  The Boston Live DVD is a MUST for those that grew upwith Fleetwood Mac.  Fleetwood Mac are in that elite group of bands who are ""multi-decade"", but perhaps ""peaked in the 70's"".  Others The stones, The Who, Led Zep, and solo follow-on's, Aerosmith, all mainline bands, while Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, etc. were deemed Heavy metal, while others  Acid-Rock). Fleetwood Mac was always on the radio somewhere.The Boston Live CD can be equated to the recent ""Yes"" release 35th anniversary.  It is YES, but they are older. I am so glad they survived 35 years and put out that DVD.  While Fleetwood Mac mostly survived,and Nicks, who everyone had a crush on, is older, it is still Fleetwood Mac. Don't pass this DVD up.  If you have ""The Dance"", this is an automatic ""Must Buy"".  If it goes out of print, you will kick yourself some day.  YES 35 years later release taught me it is O.K. that they can't quite play ""Roundabout"" at the same tempo they could back in 1979, but it is still YES.  This is still Fleetwood Mac in concert, and I have enjoyed every live concert I attended, and I will enjoy this one on DVD having not been there in Boston to attend.Enjoy it.",4,"Boston Live vs ""THe Dance""",1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,3389,"['Having', 'been', 'born', 'end', 'baby', 'boom', '42', '63', 'so', 'hard', 'not', 'remember', 'even', 'now', 'age', '42', 'time', 'what', 'was', 'grow', 'up', 'then', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'will', 'share', 'unintrested', 'can', 'skip', 'perhaps', 'were', 'unique', 'was', 'band', 'friends', 'used', 'attend', 'weekly', 'parties', 'surely', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'Mac.I', 'was', '15-16', 'when', 'Rumors', 'came', 'out', 'memories', 'Saturday', 'nights', 'heading', 'down', 'Beer', 'Distributor', 'Rumors', 'blaring', 'way', 'back', 'buying', 'avg', '6-8', 'cases', 'beer', 'person', 'heading', 'back', 'house', 'kicking', 'off', 'weekly', 'Party', '30-50', 'closest', 'friends', 'continuing', 'party', 'playing', 'much', 'music', 'weekly', 'Jam', 'session', 'yea', 'CSN', 'Y', 'Southern', 'man', 'Skinnards', 'Freebird', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'YES', 'were', 'great', 'memorys', 'loss', 'many', 'brain', 'cells', 'was', 'ALWAYS', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'songs', 'everyone', 'would', 'cram', 'room', 'where', 'was', 'playing', 'Drums', 'Jon', 'Lead', 'Guitar', 'Bill', 'Base', 'guitar', 'many', 'could', 'get', 'pick', 'up', 'keyboards', 'was', 'weekly', '2', 'years', 'Now', '42', 'saw', 'Dance', 'DVD', 'friends', 'party', 'had', 'playing', '2', 'wide', 'screen', 'TV', 'great', 'sound', 'system', 'was', 'start', 'building', 'home', 'theater', 'play', 'disc', '50', '42', 'plasma', 'later', '800', 'watts', 'Amplification', '7.1', 'fully', 'digital', 'minus', '15K', 'mind', 'blowing', 'back', 'such', 'great', 'memories', 'ones', 'remember', 'Gas', 'shortage', 'Paper', 'shortage', 'Penny', 'shortage', 'good', 'music', 'shortage', '90', 'dubbed', '70', 'era', 'music', '60', 'music', 'revolution', 'beatles', 'Dead', 'music', 'Era', 'WHAT', 'Come', 'next', 'century', 'now', 'see', 'people', 'bell', 'bottoms', '70', 'Jordache', 'bells', 'were', '60', 'then', 'are', '160', 'now', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'was', 'huge', 'part', '70', 'sound', 'Dance', 'hard', 'beat', 'as', 'far', 'capturing', 'decades', 'old', 'band', 'high', 'quality', 'video', 'audio', 'Boston', 'Concert', 'DVD', 'not', 'make', 'it.Time', 'Age', 'just', 'part', 'few', 'bands', 'were', 'staples', '60-70', 'Where', '70', 'bands', 'referred', 'Influences', '50', '60th', 'many', 'current', 'bands', 'reflect', 'poing', 'out', '70', 'bands', 'were', 'influencers', 'Boston', 'Live', 'DVD', 'MUST', 'grew', 'upwith', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'are', 'elite', 'group', 'bands', 'who', 'are', 'multi-decade', 'perhaps', 'peaked', '70', 'stones', 'Who', 'Led', 'Zep', 'solo', 'follow-on', 'Aerosmith', 'mainline', 'bands', 'Black', 'Sabbath', 'Deep', 'Purple', 'etc', 'were', 'deemed', 'Heavy', 'metal', 'others', 'Acid-Rock', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'was', 'always', 'radio', 'somewhere.The', 'Boston', 'Live', 'CD', 'can', 'be', 'equated', 'recent', 'Yes', 'release', '35th', 'anniversary', 'YES', 'are', 'older', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'survived', '35', 'years', 'put', 'out', 'DVD', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'mostly', 'survived', 'Nicks', 'who', 'everyone', 'had', 'crush', 'older', 'still', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'DVD', 'up', 'have', 'Dance', 'automatic', 'Must', 'Buy', 'print', 'will', 'kick', 'day', '35', 'years', 'later', 'release', 'O.K', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'play', 'Roundabout', 'same', 'tempo', 'could', 'back', '1979', 'still', 'YES', 'still', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'concert', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'live', 'concert', 'attended', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one', 'DVD', 'having', 'not', 'been', 'there', 'Boston', 'attend.Enjoy']",Fleetwood Mac - Live in Boston

Abilene,"[6, 6]","The quartet version of Fleetwood Mac hit the road not long after the release of SAY YOU WILL, and this deluxe set of two DVD's and one CD does a respectable job of serving as a permanent document of these shows.  Although the lovely-voiced Christine McVie will always be missed, the remaining members pull together surprisingly well into a tight, energetic unit.  The concert set is a bit too predictable for my taste, and most of the arrangements do not differ drastically from the studio versions, but this is perhaps to be expected.  In any event, these four individuals (all them well over 50 years old) still put on one hell of a show.Some of the highlights from the show include Buckingham performing some of his brilliant, rarely-heard album tracks (""Eyes of the World,"" ""Second Hand News"") and Nicks' pulse-thumping performance of her 1983 solo hit ""Stand Back.""  The new material from 2003's SAY YOU WILL is seamlessly incorporated, with the gentle, hushed ""Say Goodbye"" (featuring Buckingham's phenomenal acoustic guitar playing) emerging as the emotional highpoint of the show.  The most pleasant surprise for me was Nicks' wrenching performance of 1979's ""Beautiful Child.""  This song has always been the best composition that Nicks has ever written in my opinion and her impassioned-yet-restrained performance will leave listeners wonder why the complex, intricate song is not considered among the Mac's very best recordings.On the downside, some of the lengthy tags (which are too be somewhat expected in a concert) seem to go on forever, particularly in ""Come"" and ""World Turning"" - which are drug out far past the tasteful level.  There are also too many numbers that are performed in a manner identical to that of 1997's THE DANCE (""Dreams,"" ""Big Love,"" ""Landslide,"" ""I'm So Afraid,"" ""Silver Springs"") that feels as if the band was trying too hard to capture lighting in a bottle twice.  I would have personally rather heard some more rarely-performed material such as ""Crystal,"" ""I Know I'm Not Wrong,"" ""Storms,"" or ""Can't Go Back"" instead of so many retreads from THE DANCE.  I also didn't care for the lip-synched performance of ""Tusk"" - if the band couldn't effectively perform it without a large marching band, then the number should have simply been omitted.Aside from these missteps, however, LIVE IN BOSTON is a good recording of a highly entertaining concert with many memorable moments.  The band is largely in terrific form, with Lindsey Buckingham especially in peak condition and finally becoming a fan favorite in his own right.  The sound quality is terrific and the video transfer is fine (although it is irritatingly presented in non-anamorphic widescreen), but the included ""highlights"" CD is disappointedly skimpy with only 10 tracks included.

823230,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00023P4B0,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[167, 178]","Buckingham's hair has a grayish sheen; Nicks, who I have seen several times as a solo act, is clearly a mature woman long past the days of her svelte Welsh Witch; John McVie and Mick Fleetwood lead both of them in age.  Given this, one almost expects a &quot;nostalgia&quot; tour, but nostalgia be damned: even in the absence of Christine McVie, this is still one helluva band, and God help recent girl singers and boy bands who might be tempted to sneer: when Fleetwood Mac takes the stage, you get Big Time Take No Prisoners Rock And Roll.I was fortunate enough to see Fleetwood Mac on this particular tour when the band played Biloxi, Mississippi--and I was even more fortunate to be sitting within arm's reach of the stage, directly in front of the wall of energy the band generates.  While nothing can really duplicate the experience of a truly powerhouse live concert, LIVE IN BOSTON comes very close to capturing the authority of what I experienced that evening, and that says a great deal for both the band and this concert film.Christine McVie's absence, the loss of her cool blue voice that so perfectly balances out Buckingham and Nicks extremes, the loss of her uniquely beautiful songs--that's regrettable, but I must say the band doesn't let it slow them down any.  From such Mac standards as &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; from the classic RUMORS to picks from the recent SAY YOU WILL, everything crackles with energy.Nicks' voice, always a delicate instrument, has darkened with time and is no longer as ethereal as once it was, but her richness of tone more than makes up for the loss; songs like &quot;Landslide&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Child&quot; sound better than ever.  Buckingham's poetry-in-motion guitar playing and electrically eccentric vocals combine with a manic physical energy to create a huge musical and physical presence.  And while the unassuming John McVie fades into the background to work his wonders on bass, Mick Fleetwood is positively demonic in the star drum trap--and the two roll it out like thunder.  It's just a knockout all the way.The previous DVD of THE DANCE tour is perhaps more technically perfect--but while excellent, that performance was more formal in tone; LIVE IN BOSTON is simply raw rock and roll, ready to blow the roof off.

The OKC show suffered from horrible acoustics and technical glitches - neither was the band's fault but the Toronto show was first-class. Happily, the Boston show on this DVD is seamless and glitch-free. There are several surprises: Stevie Nicks' ""Beautiful Child"" is wonderfully emotional and beautifully sung, ""Rhiannon"" and ""Gypsy"" both fare better than on ""The Dance""  but ""Silver Springs"" is'nt performed as well - perhaps because it is familiar now and it was'nt back in 1997. Lindsey Buckingham's fiery guitar and quirky vocals are one of a kind and he is in fine form here. But Christine McVie's presence is sorely missed: her upbeat, bouncy love songs always countered the darker material from Nicks and Buckingham and her backing vocals helped propel the performances from all the voalists.

There are additional musicians (two guitarists, a keyboard player, another drummer and several female backup singers) alongside Stevie, Lindsey, Mick & John. The additional musicians are top notch and this is one reason for the outstanding sound. Whether this dvd has been overdubbed is anyones guess. But I can say that the band puts on one hell of a show - no mistake about that. They run thru their classics such as ""The Chain"", ""Dreams"", ""Rhiannon"", ""Go Your Own Way"", ""Tusk"", ""Gold Dust Woman"", ""Silver Springs"" and ""Don't Stop"" to name a few,as well as newer songs such as ""Say You Will"", ""Say Goodbye"", ""Peacekeeper"", ""Eyes Of The World"", ""Come"" and ""What's The World Coming To"". But the big surprise here is Stevie singing ""Stand Back"" (from her solo days as a recording artist) which is full of energy like I've never heard nor seen before. Longtime Fleetwood Mac member Christine Mc Vie's absence is noticeable here and her songs and voice gave the group a certain appeal that is sorely missing. This 2-dvd set also features a cd which includes a collection of songs from the two dvd's such as ""Eyes Of The World"", ""Dreams"", ""Rhiannon"", ""Big Love"", ""Landslide"" and ""Stand Back"" plus  four more.

Maybe I'm old and somewhat biased, but there's little that appeals to my age group anymore.  But these people have matured so beautifully as musicians and human beings, and the songwriting....well, that is where it all begins and ends.  Few bands share a history like this one.  The chemistry between Lindsey and Stevie onstage - the way they look at eachother - brought tears to my eyes.  Founders of the band, Mick and John, lay down a solid rhythmic foundation, while the additional backing musicians help replicate live, the intricate guitar work that Lindsey is famous for in the studio and the lush vocals.  Stevie has lost her upper range, but makes up for it in the emotion she delivers.  Lindsey's guitar work has to be seen and heard to be believed.

Short of a decade later, Four Fifths of the superstar ""fab-five"" MIGHTY MAC RUMOURS era remain happily reunited and youthfully enthusiastic exactly thirty years after joining forces to become OUR beloved FM, circa 2004. Namesakes Mick Fleetwood and John McVie maintain their savagely hypnotic hard driving rhythmic pulse and propelling forces of the band, almost 40 years on! The ""diamond"" in the band's crown, Christine McVie, has flown solo(new album is due in 2004!), but, FM have reinvented, reenergized themselves successfully as a powerhouse rock band and carried on. Stevie Nicks, remains the ""pearl"" and one of the band's vocal and visual staples. The ""ruby"", and most brilliant gem in the band's crown has always been LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM, and on this LIVE IN BOSTON Dvd, he shines onstage brighter than all the band's parts as a sum. FLEETWOOD MAC embrace their star musician, guitarist god, arranger, producer and pay tribute to his immense talents and contributions throughout the ongoing 2003-04(possibly beyond?) SAY YOU WILL Tour. LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM takes charge onstage with all his boundless cosmic energy and dramatic vocal abilities. He explodes with 'gusto' all over the stage playing his frenzied guitar solos, one sweat drenched impassioned performance after another, like a bronkin' buck bursting with the mighty spunk of a teenager whipping the audience into maddening enthusiasm throughout the show. LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM is FM's star entertainer and he comes on like a hurricane throught this LIVE IN BOSTON show! Hard to believe FLEETWOOD MAC have been around since 1967, with all this energy onstage! If FLEETWOOD MAC ever does a ""Farewell Tour"" that drags on in CHER-like proportions, CHRISTINE better jump back onboard or maybe even tour as the ""opening act"" - a ""Farewell Tour"" without Christine is NOT a true goodbye.

823237,A3VNNI6PFNK901,B00023P4B0,J. Gibson,"[15, 27]","I've been a Fleetwood Mac fan for over twenty-five years and, up until Say You Will, loved everything the band ever released.No matter how much the die-hard Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham fans want to deny it, the loss of Christine McVie was a crushing blow to the band.  Her keyboards, rock solid songwriting and angelic voice was a driving force in the band and part of the ""magic"" that made Fleetwood Mac one of the biggest bands of all time.But, Ms. McVie did not want to continue touring so she left.  Fleetwood Mac decided to soldier on without her.  What they gave their fans was Say You Will.  The band toured from May 7, 2003 to September 14, 2004 and played more than 125 shows in support of Say You Will.  Two of those shows, September 23-24, 2003 in Boston, Massachusetts were recorded for the official DVD release ""Live in Boston"".The set list was a combination of old favorites and new songs from Say You Will.  The problem with this is that there was, in my opinion, very little on Say You Will worth playing live.  One of the best songs from the record, Running Through the Garden, was played one time on opening night in Columbus, Ohio on May 7, 2003 and then dropped from the set list.The Chain, Dreams, Eyes of the World, Second Hand News, Never Going Back Again, Rhiannon, Gypsy, Big Love, Landslide, Beautiful Child, Gold Dust Woman, I'm So Afraid, Silver Springs, Tusk, Stand Back, Go Your Own Way, World Turning and Don't Stop are all old classics while Peacekeeper, Say You Will, Come, Say Goodbye, What's the World Coming To and Goodbye Baby were brand new songs from Say You Will.Eyes of the World became a peppier and more lively live track than it was back in 1982 which was a nice surprise.  Mick's short drum solo at the beginning is great and Lindsey's opening is fantastic.World Turning and Don't Stop, two Christine McVie numbers, were a disappointment on this tour.  As much as I love Stevie Nicks, she just couldn't replace Christine McVie in singing Chris' parts on the songs.  Don't Stop was a big hit for Fleetwood Mac which is why I am assuming it was kept in the set list but what was the excuse for World Turning?  It wasn't a hit and the drum solo is just maddening!Landslide is a song that, unfortunately, will probably remain in every Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks solo concert set list from now until eternity.  This song is so slow and stale now after all these years that it should really be retired and never thought of again (and the Dixie Chicks' horrid remake doesn't help it any).  About the only purpose for this song is to give the audience a chance to have an annoying little ""sing along"".  I must say, though, that Lindsey's guitar playing on Landslide is just beautiful every time.Silver Springs was a holdover from the 1997 Dance tour.  But on this tour, it seemed to lose some of the passion and heart that it had six years before.  It was no longer the heartwrenching ballad of lost love that it was in 1997.  This time around it seemed as if it was just there to take up six minutes in the set.  All the emotion was gone.Of the new songs, Peacekeeper, Say You Will and What's the World Coming To weren't bad live.  Say You Will is much better live than on the record because you don't have to suffer through the annoying kiddie chorus on the live version that you do on the record!Say Goodbye would have been a much better song had they never opted to put any vocals by Stevie on it at all.  With just Lindsey playing and singing it would have been a sweet and delicate number with much more emotional impact.Come should never have seen the light of day much less been put on Say You Will and played live.  This song is just a disgrace to Lindsey Buckingham's musical legacy as well as to the catalog of Fleetwood Mac.The real standout in this show is Beautiful Child.  Fleetwood Mac adding this song to their live set list was one of the greatest gifts they could have given their fans.  This song is just purely beautiful, whether it is the Tusk album version or any live performance of it from 2003-2004.  This song was on the Say You Will tour what Silver Springs was on the Dance tour.  It was beautiful, passionate and full of emotion.Sadly, the performances given by Fleetwood Mac for this show were less than what they are capable of.  Each and every member of the band is, or was, capable of giving a first-rate performance by putting all their heart and soul into each and every song.  It seemed here, though, that they were just going through the motions.  Stevie Nicks especially.  She didn't seem to really have any energy or desire to be there during the shows until she reached Stand Back.  Once that song was finished, her desire to be there seemed to fade away again.Even Lindsey, who was hailed by so many as being the ""star"" of this tour didn't seem to be really taking it seriously.  His stage antics for this tour and DVD were often over-the-top and too wild to really be taken seriously.  Broken guitar strings (which it seemed he struggled and worked hard to break) and throwing the guitar down to run across the stage and dance wildly about don't make good performing.  This isn't the Lindsey Buckingham I have come to respect as a musician and enjoy throughout the years.  It was almost as if he knew this tour was the last big thing for Fleetwood Mac and he was going to go out in grand style instead of playing the shows gracefully the way he did in 1997.But despite the lackluster performances and dull Say You Will songs the biggest problem with this DVD is the studio editing that was done to the recordings before they were released.Instead of releasing a DVD of the performances exactly as they played them (which they should have done) this concert was heavily touched up in the studio.  You can even hear Christine McVie singing on Tusk!  And you don't have to listen hard to hear her.  Vocals from the Dance DVD were apparently laid right over the Boston vocals to ""enhance"" them.  It's a shame that whoever was doing the editing forgot that Christine was no longer a member of the band!What Fleetwood Mac should have done was release an unedited DVD of the opening night in Columbus, Ohio.  They still had a complete set list and that show was fantastic!If you're a die-hard Fleetwood Mac fan you will want this DVD to complete your collection.  If you can look past the faults it is a mildly enjoyable show.  But if you want a truly good performance by the band and you want to hear the ""classic"" sound of Fleetwood Mac, get the Dance DVD instead of Live in Boston.  You'll enjoy every second of the Dance and won't be sorry you bought it!",2,Fleetwood Mac is Capable of MUCH More Than This!!,1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,6658,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac',

The best performances were picked and edited into one show. But this, is a complete 2 hour and 25 minute concert, shot in front of an audience of over 15,000 in Boston. The result is a hard rocking, terrific performance, shot in HD wide screen, with amazing audio and filmed beautifully. The MAC does not hold back,either!Stevie Nicks sounds great, looks beautiful, and twirls like a maniac during her solo song, ""Stand Back."" Mick's drumming is fast, furious, and kicks the show into high gear on the third song, ""Eyes of the world."" He could put a drummer 30 years younger to shame. And his trademark solo during ""World Turning"", is still crazy and entertaining, like a demented cheerleader gone psychedelic. Lindsey Buckingham's vocals sound sharper than they have in recent years, and his guitar playing is just amazing. And, let's not forget John McVie, keeping perfect bass with Mick's manic drumming! Without Christine Mcvie this time, the show is edgier, harder rocking, and although she is missed, I kind of like this version of the band for a change. Stevie's ""Rhiannon"" sounds fresh and edgy. Rare songs such as ""Beautiful child"" and new ones like ""Peacekeeper"" and ""Say you will"" rock! I cannot praise this DVD enough! It is nothing short of perfect in my eyes! I will watch this over and over and cherish it! The bonus audio CD included is a very cut down selection of songs from the DVD.

823241,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B00023P4B0,L.A. Scene,"[10, 13]","At first, I was a little skeptical when I found out that Fleetwood Mac was releasing another live set - ""Fleetwood Mac - Live in Boston"".  There were two reasons for my skeptism:  1) It was only back in 1997 that Fleetwood Mac had released ""The Dance"" on CD and Video.  This was an incredible effort by the band and I thought this was going to be very difficult to top;  2) Christine McVie had departed the band and I just didn't know whether or not the remaining four members could pull things off or not.  The good news is that Fleetwood Mac pulls through once again.  They find a way to carry on without Christine McVie and produce a solid live performance.  In fact, the level of showmanship comes very close to ""The Dance"".Fleetwood Mac's ""Live in Boston"" is actually a 3 disc set.  Two discs are DVDs and the third disc is a CD.  The two DVDs are actually from a concert done at the Fleet Center in Boston.  This performance was also broadcasted on PBS' ""Soundstage"" series.  The DVDs present the full concert - in its entirety and in the order that it was performed.  The PBS Broadcasts were 1 and 2 hour subsets - each of the subsets are reordered.  You probably will still want this collection even if you have seen the PBS set.  The DVD set provides the continuity and magic that Fleetwood Mac delivered that particular evening.This would be a 5 star collection if it weren't for the CD.  I found the CD to be a big disappointment.  The CD contains only 10 of the 24 songs.  In 2003, the progressive Rock band Rush released a DVD and CD of their 2002 Rio concert entitled ""Rush in Rio"".  ""Rush in Rio"" was originally intended to be a DVD set, but since the band found some ""magic"" with the performance, they also decided to release the performance on audio CD - in the exact order and flow that was on the DVD.  It would have been nice if Fleetwood Mac had done the same.  They clearly have ""magic"" with the DVD set, but the CD is basically a bunch of live songs.  The live songs have been somehwat reordered and you don't get a lot of the spoken words said by the band members.  While Rush released the DVD and CD separately, the Fleetwood Mac package includes both.  Another note on the CD - they could have clearly fit more than ten songs on the collection.  If you get ""Live in Boston"", get this for the DVD and not the CD.Since Christine McVie has departed - the playset doesn't include many of her songs that had her vocals.  Therefore, much of the weight on falls on Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, and Mick Fleetwood to make the show go on. (John McVie as always, lays low in the background doing what he does best - playing Bass).  Lindsey is going to provide some incredible guitar work on songs such as ""Come"", ""Big Love"", ""I'm So Afraid"", and Tusk.  Stevie Nicks gets an opportunity to do one of her solo songs - ""Stand Back"".  Mick Fleetwood even gets a chance to do some ""ramblings"" during a drum duet he performs on stage.  The band also gets an opportunity to perform some songs that haven't been done in a long time live - ""Eyes of the World"", ""Never Going Back Again"", ""Beautiful Child"",  and ""World Turning"".  The band also performs several new songs from the ""Say You Will"" album.  These include: ""Peacekeeper"", ""Come"" (definitely the best of the new work), ""Say Goodbye"", ""What's the World Coming To"", and ""Goodbye Baby"".The highlight of ""Live in Boston"" is going to be the performance of ""Stand Back"".  It was great to see Fleetwood Mac do this.  The song starts out with a two minute percussion intro.  During the concert, Fleetwood Mac brings in a great set of tour muscians.  One of the musicians who really steals the show (especially in the second half of the show) is percussionist Taku Hirano.  Hirano leads the two minute percussion which then explodes into the start of ""Stand Back"".  Stevie delivers the song with lots of intensity and trademark twirls.""Silver Springs"" was the song on ""The Dance"" that stole the show.  It's back on here.  There was a lot of emotion during this song between Lindsey and Stevie on ""The Dance"".  This time, ""Silver Springs"" has a slightly quicker tempo toward the end.  It doesn't quite live up to what was done on ""The Dance"", but it is still something you'll want to play over and over.  There isn't any loss of emotion between Stevie and Lindsey on ""Landslide"".""Tusk"" is back and better than ever.  On ""The Dance"", Fleetwood Mac utilized the USC Marching Band and it gave the song a whole new twist.  This time, Fleetwood Mac uses a Marching Band again, but this time uses a pre-recorded track.  However the song has no loss in entertainment value.  Lindsey is going to really steal the show when he goes into a bizarre kind of dance, then will go and do an embraced dance with Stevie.One thing to note, Mick Fleetwood does an incredible drum duet with Hirano during ""World Turning"".  It features some terrific rambling vocals and Fleetwood even gets out from behind the drum set.  It's great stuff.  Following that song, the band does ""Don't Stop"".  This is the only Christine McVie vocals song included - Stevie Nicks steps in flawlessly and delivers Christine's vocals.The collection includes some very thin liner notes.  They do list the songs with songwriting credits.  The stage and production credits are included as well.  The packaging is kind of cheap (cardbox box as opposed to jewel case). Overall, it's another solid live set by Fleetwood Mac.  As mentioned above, the CD is the disappointment - but the DVD set alone is worth the price of this collection.",4,The DVD Shines - The CD Disappoints,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,5548,"['first',

823243,A3ORIPRRULK20G,B00023P4B0,"Leonard Skinnard ""Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown""","[2, 5]","Fleetwood Mac performed live on the Today show out in the street last fall when this tour started. They didn't sound good, they didn't look good, Christine was sorely missing, even the backup singers didn't sound good. I generally buy a new concert DVD almost every week for the past two years if there is anything remotely good, I now have over 120 concerts, all classic rock. Last week I knew this was coming out, Fleetwood Mac is one of my favorites, so I thought, let's give it a try. I went to Suncoast Video in the Mall because I didn't want to wait, it cost the full $32.99 but they had 6 in stock, Best Buy didn't even list ""Live in Boston"" on their website. I emailed them and asked if they thought Fleetwood Mac had fallen so far that they didn't need to stock it. Best Buy replied that they were not stocking it at this time, I guess their concert DVD buyer must be a 20 year old kid. Anyway, get the DVD, it's a double DVD plus a 10 song live CD, so that's why it's so expensive.

823245,AFPR2BY85DFAD,B00023P4B0,Long Time Home Theater Guy,"[3, 3]","I would most likely consider Fleetwood Mac my favorite rock group and Stevie Nicks favorite female singer.  My music video/concert collection has long included this title as I have most of their releases including the original Mirage 1982 and Stevie Nicks 1983 concerts on LaserDisc.  I attended this performance when their tour was in my local area (not in Boston) and remember the concert with great fondness.  The Fleetwood Mac Live in Boston DVD has been enjoyed on my system countless times since it's release.With a package that includes the entire concert across 2 DVD's along with a bonus CD of 10 songs recorded during their performance, why a 3 star rating for a title I must truly like?  It all has to do with the potential of what's possible now compared to when this DVD was originally released.  First is the need to zoom the non-anamorphic 16x9 coding so that it properly fills out the display area on modern widescreens each time I watch which results in a further loss of picture resolution.  The 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack generally provides good crowd surrounds to help simulate the feeling of actually being in the audience though the dynamic range is more limited than it could have been.How do I know?  Most of the time packaged media (i.e. DVD, Blu-ray) is far superior to what is possible via downloads (Netflix; Amazon; iTunes, etc.) or from cable/satellite providers due to the wider signal bandwidths available and utilized.  Recently I was scanning through my cable (Comcast) channels and found this concert being broadcast by Palladia in HD.  Immediately hit the record button on my HD DVR cable box.Afterwards, I performed an A-B comparison between the version that was recorded from cable and my DVD copies. No question the image even at 1080i/60 has the clarity the DVD simply cannot match.  Much of the concert was recorded under very dark stage environments with many of the FM members also wearing predominately Black.  Instead of being crushed as they are on the DVD, the cable image has much better detailing in the dark portions of the screen.  While the broadcast audio (source ""Direct"" through my receiver) was also 5.1 Dolby Digital, it was easy to hear the much improved bass response resulting in added fullness to the entire sound field.  High frequencies also benefited from not being nearly as compressed with the new found clarity adding much sparkle and life to these same performances I know well.Since it appears the HD masters already exist, Soundstage/Warner Reprise/WTTW Chicago/HD Ready or whomever has the rights to this program, I'm ready to upgrade to the Blu-ray version of this title.  About the only new coding needed would be 5.1 (or better yet 7.1) DTS HD/Dolby HD Lossless audio tracks and the package would be complete.",3,Soundstage/Warner Reprise:  Time for the Blu-ray release,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,2785,"['would', 'most', 'likely', 'consider', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'favorite', 'rock', 'group', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'favorite', 'female', 'singer', 'music', 'video/concert', 'collection', 'long', 'included', 'title', 'have', 'most', 'releases', 'including', 'original', 'Mirage', '1982', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', '1983', 'concerts', 'LaserDisc', 'attended', 'performance', 'when', 'tour', 'was', 'local', 'area', 'not', 'Boston', 'remember', 'concert', 'great', 'fondness', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'Live', 'Boston', 'DVD', 'been', 'enjoyed', 'system', 'countless', 'times', 'release.With', 'package', 'entire', 'concert', '2', 'DVD', 'along', 'bonus', 'CD', '10', 'songs', 'recorded', 'performance', 'why', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'title', 'must', 'truly', 'do', 'potential', 'what', 'possible', 'now', 'compared', 'when', 'DVD', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'First', 'need', 'zoom', 'non-anamorphic', '16x9', 'coding', 'so', 'properly', 'out', 'display', 'area', 'modern', 'widescreens', 'time', 'watch', 'results', 'further', 'loss', 'picture', 'resolution', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'soundtrack', 'generally', 'good', 'crowd', 'surrounds', 'help', 'simulate', 'feeling', 'actually', 'being', 'audience', 'dynamic', 'range', 'more', 'limited', 'could', 'have', 'been.How', 'do', 'know', 'Most', 'time', 'packaged', 'media', 'i.e', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'far', 'superior', 'what', 'possible', 'downloads', 'Netflix', 'Amazon', 'iTunes', 'etc', 'cable/satellite', 'providers', 'due', 'wider', 'signal', 'bandwidths', 'available', 'utilized', 'Recently', 'was', 'scanning', 'cable', 'Comcast', 'channels', 'found', 'concert', 'being', 'broadcast', 'Palladia', 'HD', 'Immediately', 'hit', 'record', 'button', 'HD', 'DVR', 'cable', 'box.Afterwards', 'performed', 'A-B', 'comparison', 'version', 'was', 'recorded', 'cable', 'DVD', 'copies', 'question', 'image', 'even', '1080i/60', 'clarity', 'DVD', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'match', 'Much', 'concert', 'was', 'recorded', 'very', 'dark', 'stage', 'environments', 'many', 'FM', 'members', 'also', 'wearing', 'predominately', 'Black', 'Instead', 'being', 'crushed', 'are', 'DVD', 'cable', 'image', 'much', 'better', 'detailing', 'dark', 'portions', 'screen', 'broadcast', 'audio', 'source', 'Direct', 'receiver', 'was', 'also', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'was', 'easy', 'hear', 'much', 'improved', 'bass', 'response', 'resulting', 'added', 'fullness', 'entire', 'sound', 'field', 'High', 'frequencies', 'also', 'benefited', 'not', 'being', 'nearly', 'compressed', 'new', 'found', 'clarity', 'adding', 'much', 'sparkle', 'life', 'same', 'performances', 'know', 'well.Since', 'HD', 'masters', 'already', 'exist', 'Soundstage/Warner', 'Reprise/WTTW', 'Chicago/HD', 'Ready', 'rights', 'program', ""'m"", 'ready', 'upgrade', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'title', 'only', 'new', 'coding', 'needed', 'would', 'be', '5.1', 'better', 'yet', '7.1', 'DTS', 'HD/Dolby', 'HD', 'Lossless', 'audio', 'tracks', 'package', 'would', 'be', 'complete']",Fleetwood Mac - Live in Boston

Christine McVie's absence is noticeable, but the band still has it together.  Although Stevie Nicks voice is a few octaves lower and she doesn't spin around the stage as much, she still has confidence in her abilities.  Mick Fleetwood is a crazy man, as ever, never missing a beat and throwing himself into his percussion with open mouth fervor.  John McVie has never been a showcase performer, but his bass guitar runs perfectly with Fleetwood's drumming.  However, the show really belongs to Buckingham, who loves the spotlight and does things with his guitar that can be startling.  Literally, grabbing at his strings with both hands in a seemingly random manner, he livens up the show whenever he solos.  The performance is top notch and feels better than ""The Dance"" which was somewhat more cold and calculated.  The light show surpasses ""The Dance"" as well with variations and enhancements not seen before.  The only complaint I have is that this wasn't released in DTS as well.

How many times have they released concert videos with the same songs- the Chain, Dreams, Go Your Own Way, Rhiannon, Gold Dust Woman, Don't Stop, etc. I mean, there's really nothing new here, with the exception of Beautiful Child, and a handful of songs from their CD Say You Will. The repetition is painful, especially watching Stevie do her silly hand motions during EVERY chorus of Say You Will or Lindsay's song Come, which grinds what little energy there is to a halt. Fleetwood Mac has such a wealth of material to draw from, it's a shame that they stuck with the same songs they've been doing for 30 years, with virtually no variation. They could have challenged themselves by letting Stevie sing You Make Loving Fun or bringing back old treasures like Sara or Blue Letter, but instead they merely repeat their performance from the Dance.

823251,A1ZGAT1A95PTJK,B00023P4B0,"Richard A. Siler ""rasiler2""","[6, 9]","First of all, I wrote a review of THE DANCE that seemed to never get posted.  It wasn't very complimentary.  That show was very lack-lustre to me; it was too polished, too rehearsed, and severely lacked energy.  It seemed more like a recital than a concert.  But that's mostly because it was a one-off, ""staged"" show to record a live ""reunion"" album.This new DVD is far, far superior to THE DANCE.  The energy level is so much higher, and the performance is much more ""real.""  Part of that is simply song selection, which is much better for this tour.  But also, it was filmed in front of a real audience as part of a real tour.  And it shows.The hands-down highlight of this DVD is ""Come.""  First of all, this song is one of the best tracks from SAY YOU WILL, and one of Lindsey's best tracks ever.  But the performance of it here is absolutely incindiary.  This reconfirms my notion that he is one of the absolute geniuses of modern rock music.  BUY THIS DVD JUST FOR THIS ONE SONG.  I'm not kidding!But then, every song here from SAY YOU WILL comes across even better than the original versions.  The music on that album was made to be performed live, and its a shame that they don't do more of it.Other highlights include a great new version of ""Eyes of the World""; a ""Rhiannon"" that is still pale compared to Stevie's excorcism rituals of the 70s (as Mick once called it), but much better than what was on THE DANCE; a really killer new rendition of ""Never Goin' Back Again""; a mesmerizing performance of ""Beautiful Child"" (this is the first tour this song's ever been included in); a blazing ""Stand Back""; and for me at least (I know I'm in the minority here!), Mick's solo during ""World Turning.""This is an almost perfect Mac concert.  I honestly can't think what I would have changed about this, other than to include 1 or 2 more tunes from SAY YOU WILL.So why did I only give it 4 stars??  Because of the accompanying CD.  On the one hand, I'm thrilled that they included a CD with the DVD.  Brilliant move.  But if they were going to do that, why in the hell did they just include repeats of the songs that were on THE DANCE CD????  That makes absolutely no sense.  Out of the 10 songs, only 3 of them (""Come,"" ""Eyes"", and ""Stand Back"") are ""new"".  We still don't have an ""official"" live version of ""Gypsy"" or ""Gold Dust Woman"", and those two sounded quite fine here and should have been included on the CD.  As should ""Beautiful Child"".  We certainly don't need yet another live album with ""Rhiannon"", ""Dreams"", ""Landslide"" and ""Silver Springs"", especially as these versions are in almost exactly the same arrangements as what were played for THE DANCE.  Assinine.  And why only one SYW song?  Luckily, it was ""Come"".  But ""Peacekeeper"" at least should also have been included.So if I were rating only the DVD, this would get 5 stars easily, and I would wish that I could rate it higher.  But a star gets taken off for making the effort to include a CD, but making it almost pointless.A lot of people ranked THE DANCE very highly, which I don't agree with.

Because of this, the picture quality is poor.I can't imagine what they were thinking when they made the decision to encode it this way.Why bring a camera crew to a concert, shoot a wonderful performance and then release it in a compressed format?But, despite all that, the concert is fantastic.

Beautiful Child is one of those hidden treasures that deserved to be heard and now it is.Yes, the band is older.  No, Stevie doesn't twirl as much and can't kick her foot higher than her head anymore...but who cares.  The band's music and Stevie & Lindsey's voices are as strong as ever.If the band needs to prove anything, they do!  They prove that they can sing their classic songs with older, wiser voices and they prove, with their new songs, they they still have what it takes to touch their audience.I have only one disappointment and it concerns the packaging of this DVD/CD set.
