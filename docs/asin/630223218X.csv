Junior and Ben have left &quot;mother dearest&quot; and are now on their own.  They've moved, and if you think it's to escape trouble, you're wrong.  Junior is up to his old tricks.  He goes after everyone from bullys to the women of the town, and even the local terror, Trixie.  The two duke it out a bit before finally joining forces to thwart the plans of Big Ben Healy.  The movie has a lot of laughs, and even some heart.  If you love the first one, you'll love this one.  I highly recommend it, and if worse comes to worse, just pull a Junior to make a sunny day even sunnier.  :)",4,The title say it all...,1000857600,"09 19, 2001",2001,696,"['What', 'can', 'truly', 'say', 'movie', 'first', 'one', 'classic', 'one', 'same', 'vein', 'Junior', 'Ben', 'have', 'left', 'quot', 'dearest', 'quot', 'are', 'now', 'own', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'think', 'escape', 'trouble', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'Junior', 'up', 'old', 'tricks', 'everyone', 'bullys', 'women', 'town', 'even', 'local', 'terror', 'Trixie', 'two', 'duke', 'out', 'bit', 'finally', 'joining', 'forces', 'thwart', 'plans', 'Big', 'Ben', 'Healy', 'movie', 'lot', 'laughs', 'even', 'heart', 'love', 'first', 'one', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one', 'highly', 'recommend', 'worse', 'worse', 'just', 'pull', 'Junior', 'make', 'sunny', 'day', 'even', 'sunnier']",Problem Child 2 VHS
