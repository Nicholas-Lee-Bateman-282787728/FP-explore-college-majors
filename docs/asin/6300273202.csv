238915,A3SZXYX9YEDGT6,6300273202,"Addison Dewitt ""I'm nobody's fool.""","[4, 4]","I first saw a bit of this film on TCM and was hooked. Being a fan of any thing southern and trashy, this film was a ""must-have"" in my personal library. And I was richly rewarded with just about every frame.All the stars give amazing performances, but none are better than the incredible Eli Wallach, playing a 2nd generation, Italian cotton gin owner. His pushing Carrol Baker for the truth about how his gin was ruined is some of the best acting in his career. Sometimes the film turns a bit silly and almost slides into schmaltzy comedy, but it redeems itself in the end. I can't say more, you need to watch to find out how. Karl Malden does a great job of playing an alcoholic buffoon who is being held off from bedding his wife and is the joke of the county. And the part of Aunt Rose Comfort is a nice addition to the cast, without which the story would suffer.As uncomfortable as some seduction scenes are in this film, imagine how it went down in the 50s! The censors were probably shocked speechless. By today's standards it's rather tame, but the one scene with Wallach on the swing pursuing Ms. Baker made my cheeks turn red, and remember, that's with no explicit language or nudity!An interesting and entertaining take on racism and small-town justice in the south.",4,A Trashy Southern Joy Ride,1307145600,"06 4, 2011",2011,1276,"['first', 'saw', 'bit', 'film', 'TCM', 'was', 'hooked', 'Being', 'fan', 'thing', 'southern', 'trashy', 'film', 'was', 'must-have', 'personal', 'library', 'was', 'richly', 'rewarded', 'just', 'frame.All', 'stars', 'give', 'amazing', 'performances', 'none', 'are', 'better', 'incredible', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'playing', '2nd', 'generation', 'Italian', 'cotton', 'gin', 'owner', 'pushing', 'Carrol', 'Baker', 'truth', 'how', 'gin', 'was', 'ruined', 'best', 'acting', 'career', 'film', 'bit', 'silly', 'almost', 'slides', 'schmaltzy', 'comedy', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'need', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'alcoholic', 'buffoon', 'who', 'being', 'held', 'off', 'bedding', 'wife', 'joke', 'county', 'part', 'Aunt', 'Rose', 'Comfort', 'nice', 'addition', 'cast', 'story', 'would', 'suffer.As', 'uncomfortable', 'seduction', 'scenes', 'are', 'film', 'imagine', 'how', 'went', 'down', '50s', 'censors', 'were', 'probably', 'shocked', 'speechless', 'today', 'standards', 'rather', 'tame', 'one', 'scene', 'Wallach', 'swing', 'pursuing', 'Ms.', 'Baker', 'made', 'cheeks', 'turn', 'red', 'remember', 'explicit', 'language', 'nudity', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'take', 'racism', 'small-town', 'justice', 'south']",N/A
238916,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300273202,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","There is a campiness to `Baby Doll' that one has to embrace in order to enjoy.  I, for one, wasn't prepared for it.  I'm a huge fan of Tennessee Williams and the film adaptations for his work have grown to be absolute favorites of mine.  When I see that his name was attached to a film, I get excited, like a school girl catching a glimpse of Justin Bieber.  I was really excited about this film.  I love Karl Malden and was anticipating greatness from him and the film.He was wonderful as the frustrated husband to Carroll Baker's mentally challenged wife.  The film wasn't so much a treasure as I expected.There are some things I really respect about the film and the way that Williams wrote out his concept.  Mental instability through the eyes of Tennessee Williams isn't' pretty, but it also it's what you'd expect.  Using sex as a springboard for some outlandish actions, the story builds on a preposterous foundation that you have to be able to embrace with open arms, otherwise the whole thing will be lost on you.  Like I said, I wasn't ready for this.Baby Doll is a young woman, on the verge of 20, who is married to an older man who has given her a certain wealth in exchange for her `consummation'.  Their agreement was that he would wait until her 20th birthday to seek his `payment' from her, and now that her time is up she is having serious second thoughts.  She hates him, and quite frankly he seems to hate her.  Archie's wealth is fading and Baby Doll's eyes are wondering, and when a Sicilian cotton farmer comes into town, both attempt to exploit him (but it's not like he's innocent here).  What happens next is a bizarre game of hide and seek and some rather outlandish antics that create a tonally confused film that could have used a sharper focus.  Despite containing some intriguing performances, the film doesn't convey what I think it was shooting for.Carroll Baker takes the reigns here and goes all out, and I respect that.  Malden and Wallach have supporting roles here, and they are two polar opposites and both very effective.  Mildred Dunnock does nothing and her Oscar nomination is baffling to say the least.Honestly, this film felt like the 1950's `Paperboy'; steamy, southern and ridiculous.  I don't hate this, I actually liked it, but to call it anything other than absurd would be a lie.",3,"A pulpy, scattered hot-mess!",1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,2329,"['campiness', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'one', 'embrace', 'order', 'enjoy', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'prepared', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'film', 'adaptations', 'work', 'have', 'grown', 'be', 'absolute', 'favorites', 'mine', 'When', 'see', 'name', 'was', 'attached', 'film', 'get', 'excited', 'school', 'girl', 'catching', 'glimpse', 'Justin', 'Bieber', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'film', 'love', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'was', 'anticipating', 'greatness', 'film.He', 'was', 'wonderful', 'frustrated', 'husband', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'wife', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'treasure', 'are', 'things', 'really', 'respect', 'film', 'way', 'Williams', 'wrote', 'out', 'concept', 'Mental', 'instability', 'eyes', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'also', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Using', 'sex', 'springboard', 'outlandish', 'actions', 'story', 'preposterous', 'foundation', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'embrace', 'open', 'arms', 'otherwise', 'whole', 'thing', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'ready', 'this.Baby', 'Doll', 'young', 'woman', 'verge', '20', 'who', 'married', 'older', 'man', 'who', 'given', 'certain', 'wealth', 'exchange', 'consummation', 'agreement', 'was', 'would', 'wait', '20th', 'birthday', 'seek', 'payment', 'now', 'time', 'having', 'serious', 'second', 'thoughts', 'quite', 'frankly', 'hate', 'Archie', 'wealth', 'fading', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'eyes', 'are', 'wondering', 'when', 'Sicilian', 'cotton', 'farmer', 'town', 'attempt', 'exploit', 'not', 'innocent', 'here', 'What', 'next', 'bizarre', 'game', 'hide', 'seek', 'rather', 'outlandish', 'antics', 'create', 'tonally', 'confused', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'sharper', 'focus', 'containing', 'intriguing', 'performances', 'film', ""n't"", 'convey', 'what', 'think', 'was', 'shooting', 'for.Carroll', 'Baker', 'reigns', 'here', 'respect', 'Malden', 'Wallach', 'have', 'supporting', 'roles', 'here', 'are', 'two', 'polar', 'opposites', 'very', 'effective', 'Mildred', 'Dunnock', 'nothing', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'baffling', 'say', 'least.Honestly', 'film', 'felt', '1950', 'Paperboy', 'steamy', 'southern', 'ridiculous', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'actually', 'liked', 'call', 'anything', 'other', 'absurd', 'would', 'be', 'lie']",N/A
238917,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6300273202,Austin Somlo,"[0, 5]","Viewed: 3/10Rate: 23/10: Where is the fun in watching a film involving a spoiled, uneducated brat? Elia Kazan tries to give us that in Baby Doll. One thing is absolutely clear: Elia Kazan needs Marlon Brando or James Dean in order to make successful films. I've never liked the works of Tennessee Williams, and the only reason why A Streetcar Named Desire was popular is because of Marlon Brando. In Baby Doll, I get Karl Malden who goes bat-crazy and tries to tear the place up. Nice, but he looks corny, and the effect on me quickly wears off. Really, Karl is too good of an actor to be this rubbish. Meanwhile, the story of the film is silly, and Carroll Baker is very annoying playing as Baby Doll. She isn't even that pretty. A rumor is that Marilyn Monroe wanted to be cast in the film. Now...I can see the film to work, sort of in the vein of And God Created Woman (actually made in the same year as Baby Doll). A near 20 year old girl sucks her thumb and sleeps in a crib? In a way, I can see the film being a Lolita, but we are talking about a 20 year old female, perfectly old enough to have consensual sexual relations. On the other hand, I can't imagine people living in a house like that and having not much of food to eat, and yet everybody looks fine and healthy....impossible. Eli Wallach...damn, he wouldn't muscle his way out if he went against Marlon Brando. What a pitiful arrogance as always. After looking up the history behind Baby Doll, I have to chuckle... Scandalous? Dirty? Unholy? Hmm, I hope I am watching the same film that they saw in the mid 50s because I saw nothing interesting. I was just simply bored. All in all, after seeing Baby Doll, it is apparent that Elia Kazan badly needs Marlon Brando or James Dean.",1,The Annoying Whiny Spoiled Brat.,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,1745,"['Viewed', '3/10Rate', '23/10', 'Where', 'fun', 'watching', 'film', 'involving', 'spoiled', 'uneducated', 'brat', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'give', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'One', 'thing', 'absolutely', 'clear', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'James', 'Dean', 'order', 'make', 'successful', 'films', ""'ve"", 'never', 'liked', 'works', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'was', 'popular', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'get', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'who', 'bat-crazy', 'tries', 'tear', 'place', 'up', 'Nice', 'corny', 'effect', 'quickly', 'off', 'Really', 'Karl', 'too', 'good', 'actor', 'be', 'rubbish', 'Meanwhile', 'story', 'film', 'silly', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'very', 'annoying', 'playing', 'Baby', 'Doll', ""n't"", 'even', 'pretty', 'rumor', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'wanted', 'be', 'cast', 'film', 'Now', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'work', 'sort', 'vein', 'God', 'Created', 'Woman', 'actually', 'made', 'same', 'year', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'near', '20', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'thumb', 'sleeps', 'crib', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'being', 'Lolita', 'are', 'talking', '20', 'year', 'old', 'female', 'perfectly', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'consensual', 'sexual', 'relations', 'other', 'hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'people', 'living', 'house', 'having', 'not', 'much', 'food', 'eat', 'yet', 'everybody', 'fine', 'healthy', '.impossible', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'damn', 'would', ""n't"", 'muscle', 'way', 'went', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'What', 'pitiful', 'arrogance', 'always', 'looking', 'up', 'history', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'have', 'chuckle', 'Scandalous', 'Dirty', 'Unholy', 'Hmm', 'hope', 'am', 'watching', 'same', 'film', 'saw', 'mid', '50s', 'saw', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'was', 'just', 'simply', 'bored', 'seeing', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'apparent', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'badly', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'James', 'Dean']",N/A
238918,APP5MBH2BSX6I,6300273202,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[37, 39]","Archie Lee (Karl Malden) has had the hots for Baby Doll (Carroll Baker) since she was jail bait.  Eventually her elderly father, who obviously sired her late in life and spoiled her silly, passed away, and foolishly agreed to let Archie Lee marry her when she reached age 18 so she'd be taken care of when he was gone.She was, as she plaintively says, ""not ready for marriage.""  And now, nearly two years later, she still isn't.  Her 20th birthday is approaching (not 19th, as some reviews here say for some reason), and her agreement with Archie has been that she'll be ""ready"" on her 20th birthday.  Archie is so excited he literally can't sit still....and we can't blame him.Director Elia Kazan does his usual terrific job with his method directing, making sure we feel what's going on even if we can't understand all of it.  The poor oaf played by Malden is helpless in the hands of the object of his desire, and she loathes him.  Eli Wallach, in a terrific film debut, is insightful and virile, his attentions turning Baby Doll into a woman before our eyes.Much has been said about the steaminess and controversy surrounding this film, and there's a reason for that, viewed in its context as a 1956 sensation.  And Kazan certainly makes us feel this as well.  The story builds to some appropriate climaxes (none of them explicitly sexual) and never allows our attention to flag.  The tension, in spite of expert comedy touches along the way, never flags either.  Doubtless the best Kazan/Tennessee Williams collaboration not starring Brando.Malden was in the middle of a successful film career here, long before his days as the longtime American Express spokesman.  Wallach went on to a successful film career himself.  Baker, in spite of a Best Actress Oscar nomination for ""Baby Doll,"" sadly degenerated to a caricature of this character, a one-note sexpot, in most of her roles, including the dreadful ""The Secret Diary of Sigmund Freud,"" starring Bud Cort (Harold of ""Harold and Maude"") as the famous therapist himself.  Please remember her this way; she was brilliant as the virginal, coquettish overaged Lolita yet to fully awaken....and then having awakened.

238923,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,6300273202,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[6, 13]","The setting of ""Baby Doll"" apparently is the agrarian South of the 1940s.  Carol Baker plays an ingenue who's married to the much older Karl Malden.  He calls the immature girl his Baby Doll and promises not to touch her sexually until she turns 19 years old.  Needless to add, this marital relationship leaves something to bedesired.  Malden is in the cotton business and attempts to manipulate his competitor El Wallach by inviting the latter over to the house.  This turns out not to be a wise decision for a man in Malden's precarious predicament.  Wallach is attracted to Baby Doll's innocence and vulnerability.  He set his sights on her particularly after Malden is suspected of trying to burn down his cotton mill.  Baby Doll is initially hesitant and then eager to indulge in some hanky-panky with the more virile Wallach.Is ""Baby Doll"" an aesthetically great film?  No, it barely warrants 4 stars.  The Director Elia Kazan had to do his best with little financial backing.  The supposed summertime outdoor scenes were actually filmed during the cold months of the year.  These actors had to exercise considerable self control to complete the movie.  The temperatures were often slightly above freezing.  Tennessee Williams may have written the script, but this is definitely not his greatest work.  And yet, I strongly believe that ""Baby doll"" should be required viewing for all college students.  Moreover,  everyone should see ""Baby Doll,"" released in 1956, at least once in their life. This might be the best movie to assist one to realize the mind boggling social changes the United States has undergone in the last 46 years.  There is no nudity, novulgar language, and the adulterous sex is merely implied. However, religious organizations throughout America soundly condemned this relatively bland movie. It seems laughable that ""Baby Doll"" has a current ""R"" rating for it hardly warrants a PG-13.  Anyone not yet 40 years old will be particularly bewildered by the controversy surrounding ""Baby Doll.""  Most parent wouldn't hesitate to permit their teenagers to see it.

238924,A8V74RZY8TIRJ,6300273202,"Forrest C. Hopson ""StarWatcher""","[6, 9]","I recently watched this steamy tale of two Southern rivals and a sensuous 19-year-old virgin, as one of the dvds in the Tennessee Williams Collection box set, and I must say it still packs a punch!  Archie Lee Meighan, (perfectly cast and played by Karl Malden, see him as Vivian Leigh's sympathetic beau in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"") is the middle-aged cotton gin owner, who made a deal with his now deceased father-in-law, that he would not consummate the marriage to his daughter until her 20th birthday.  Oddly named Baby Doll, (Carroll Baker's performance was nominated for an Academy award) is constantly reminding her husband of his ""old age"" and that she'll move out of the old Southern mansion, which is literally falling down around them, and move to town, if he tries touching her again.  But it's when rival cotton gin owner Silva Vaccaro (great performance by Eli Wallach) puts Archie and his fellow cotton gin workers out of business and into debt, by successfully operating his Cotton Gin Syndicate.Archie is so infuriated and in fear of losing his child bride, due to his indebtedness they have lost all of their furniture, and so he goes and sets fire to Vaccaro's cotton gin.  Suspecting Archie of burning his gin down, and getting no help from the Mississippi police or towns people, Vaccaro takes an erotic form of Sicilian vengeance.  Tennessee Williams ""Baby Doll"" is filmed in glorious black & white and the sound is crisp and clear.  Karl Malden calling out ""Baby Dollllll!!"" at the top of his lungs as he waits for her to come to the car and later at the end of the picture, are quiet comical and shows how unstable Malden's character, Archie, is becoming.I recommend buying this dvd as part of the ""Tennessee Williams Film Collection"" box set.  Even though it's reached Hollywood classic status and is very entertaining, it's not one of my personal favorites.  ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" ""Cat On a Hot Tin Roof,"" ""Sweet Bird of Youth,"" and ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone,"" are the jewels of this collection.  It's very nice to have ""Baby Doll"" and ""The Night of the Iguana"" as part of the box set and to add to my dvd collection.  I mainly like this movie for Carroll Baker's performance, she first caught my attention as Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson's daughter in the modern day western classic, ""Giant"" (1956) and as the almost-bride of dashing Gregory Peck in ""The Big Country.""  Tennessee Williams fans of steamy Southern dramas should check out the Joanne Woodward - Paul Newman sizzler, ""The Long, Hot Summer,"" (1958) which I thought was a Tennessee Williams movie for years!

Everything just came together - the sometimes forceful, sometimes subtle acting, the unusual and interesting screen-play, the filming in gorgeous black and white and the swift pace of the film, fueled by an ambiguous romance or revenge and spot on dialogue full of nuance, subtlety and oh yeah - sexuality.  It was entrancing and commanded your attention.  I was kind of expecting one of those plays that tries to be a movie, but as I said, once this movie takes off, it becomes a living thing that is simultaneously awful and awesome to witness. You sense you are in the presence of something special - poetry or swanky blues, but what brings the blues to one awakens fire in another.  You'll probably sympathize with all the characters at one time or another or maybe all at the same time.  Now I want to see another Tennessee Williams movie adaptation.The special features are great on this DVD as well and substantial with modern interviews with the three key actors which is something of a documentary on the movie and all the controversy it raised when if first came out in '56.  With the movie itself delving into themes of middle-age and youth, it was interesting to see Baby Doll herself 'all growed up' and for real!  There are trailers and may be another short feature from the time of the film as well, plus subtitles in English, French and Spanish.

238927,A3UGLMD1GKIZGR,6300273202,"Jason Robey ""horakhti""","[82, 86]","I had the privilege of seeing this excellent film last week at the AFI Silver Theater, which recently ran a month-long tribute to the late, great director Elia Kazan. Kazan is notable for his collaborations with a young Marlon Brando, directing the rising star in three films during the early 50s: ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" ""Viva Zapata!"" and the masterpiece ""On the Waterfront."" Many film critics put ""Baby Doll"" right behind ""On the Waterfront"" when ranking Kazan's filmography. Having seen it, I would likely do the same (though I haven't seen all of Kazan's films yet).Eli Wallach, who plays Silva Vaccaro in ""Baby Doll,"" was on hand to introduce the film at the AFI Silver. He spoke for about 45 minutes and, though he's in his 80s, had the audience (about 40 or 50 of us) roaring with laughter. I was amazed at how many top actors and directors he's worked with. He spoke mainly about ""Baby Doll,"" which he says is his favorite film.Here are a few things I learned from Eli Wallach about ""Baby Doll"": His hands were NOT anywhere near Carroll Baker's private parts during the notoriously erotic swing scene, as reported in many a film review at the time. Rather, they were resting on a space heater; though ""Baby Doll"" takes place in the heat of summer, the film was shot during winter. In fact, the actors had to suck on ice cubes before each take so their breath wouldn't show. Wallach spent more time in the iconic baby crib than Baby Doll herself. This was Wallach's first film.""Baby Doll"" is based on two one-act plays by Tennessee Williams: ""27 Wagons Full of Cotton"" and ""The Unsatisfactory Supper."" Anyone familiar with Tennessee Williams knows that his writing is very southern and very steamy. ""Baby Doll"" may be the steamiest, most erotic thing he ever wrote.The owner of a private cotton gin, Archie Lee, has his hands full with ""child bride"" Baby Doll, who sleeps in a crib and won't let her husband touch her until she turns 20. With her birthday in a few days, Baby Doll, played by the impossibly-cute Carroll Baker, is threatening to ""withhold"" unless her aging, doltish husband starts raking in the dough. After their furniture is hauled off, Lee, played by Karl Malden, sets fire to the new cotton gin that's been taking away his business. Silva Vaccaro, a firey Sicilian businessman played by Eli Wallach, vows to exact revenge on the person who burned down his gin. Suspicions lead him directly to Lee's doorstep where, over the course of an afternoon, he proceeds to destroy the man's life.The heart of the movie is Vaccaro's seduction of Baby Doll. No flesh is ever shown, nothing explicit is ever uttered and I believe there's only one kiss in the entire film. Regardless, this is some of the hottest, most erotic footage in American film. The dialogue, the acting, the way it's directed: the overall effect is like watching passionate sex, yet it's simply two people talking - and they're not even talking about sex! To me, this type of filmmaking is magical, when the director conjures something out of thin air that isn't even there.""Baby Doll"" was highly, highly controversial upon its release in 1956. It was condemned by The Legion of Decency, an organization of the Roman Catholic Church, who claimed that it was immoral. Because of the hype, it was withdrawn from over 70 percent of U.S. theaters before its premiere. Several film critics at the time called it the most pornographic film ever released by a film studio. Today however, very few would likely get in a fuss over it.""Baby Doll"" is a great film that now ranks among my favorites of all time. It's not only sexy, but very funny, well-acted, well-written and expertly directed. It may seem a little dated to most modern viewers, but I personally think it holds up quite well (but then, I do watch a lot of old films.) If and when ""Baby Doll"" is produced for DVD, I hope the studio considers Eli Wallach for the audio commentary.",5,Kazan Conjures Carnality,1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,3926,"['had', 'privilege', 'seeing', 'excellent', 'film', 'last', 'week', 'AFI', 'Silver', 'Theater', 'recently', 'ran', 'month-long', 'tribute', 'late', 'great', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Kazan', 'notable', 'collaborations', 'young', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'directing', 'rising', 'star', 'three', 'films', 'early', '50s', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', 'Viva', 'Zapata', 'masterpiece', 'Waterfront', 'Many', 'film', 'critics', 'put', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'right', 'Waterfront', 'when', 'ranking', 'Kazan', 'filmography', 'Having', 'seen', 'would', 'likely', 'do', 'same', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Kazan', 'films', 'yet', '.Eli', 'Wallach', 'who', 'Silva', 'Vaccaro', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'was', 'hand', 'introduce', 'film', 'AFI', 'Silver', 'spoke', '45', 'minutes', '80s', 'had', 'audience', '40', '50', 'roaring', 'laughter', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'many', 'top', 'actors', 'directors', 'worked', 'spoke', 'mainly', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'favorite', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'learned', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'hands', 'were', 'NOT', 'anywhere', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'private', 'parts', 'notoriously', 'erotic', 'swing', 'scene', 'reported', 'many', 'film', 'review', 'time', 'Rather', 'were', 'resting', 'space', 'heater', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'place', 'heat', 'summer', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'winter', 'fact', 'actors', 'had', 'suck', 'ice', 'cubes', 'take', 'so', 'breath', 'would', ""n't"", 'show', 'Wallach', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'iconic', 'baby', 'crib', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'was', 'Wallach', 'first', 'film', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'based', 'two', 'one-act', 'plays', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', '27', 'Wagons', 'Full', 'Cotton', 'Unsatisfactory', 'Supper', 'Anyone', 'familiar', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'writing', 'very', 'southern', 'very', 'steamy', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'may', 'be', 'steamiest', 'most', 'erotic', 'thing', 'ever', 'wrote.The', 'owner', 'private', 'cotton', 'gin', 'Archie', 'Lee', 'hands', 'full', 'child', 'bride', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'who', 'crib', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'husband', 'touch', '20', 'birthday', 'few', 'days', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'played', 'impossibly-cute', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'threatening', 'withhold', 'aging', 'doltish', 'husband', 'raking', 'dough', 'furniture', 'hauled', 'off', 'Lee', 'played', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'fire', 'new', 'cotton', 'gin', 'been', 'taking', 'away', 'business', 'Silva', 'Vaccaro', 'firey', 'Sicilian', 'businessman', 'played', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'exact', 'revenge', 'person', 'who', 'burned', 'down', 'gin', 'Suspicions', 'lead', 'directly', 'Lee', 'doorstep', 'where', 'course', 'afternoon', 'destroy', 'man', 'life.The', 'heart', 'movie', 'Vaccaro', 'seduction', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'flesh', 'ever', 'shown', 'nothing', 'explicit', 'ever', 'uttered', 'believe', 'only', 'one', 'kiss', 'entire', 'film', 'Regardless', 'hottest', 'most', 'erotic', 'footage', 'American', 'film', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'way', 'directed', 'overall', 'effect', 'watching', 'passionate', 'sex', 'simply', 'two', 'people', 'talking', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'talking', 'sex', 'type', 'filmmaking', 'magical', 'when', 'director', 'something', 'thin', 'air', ""n't"", 'even', 'there', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'was', 'highly', 'highly', 'controversial', 'release', '1956', 'was', 'condemned', 'Legion', 'Decency', 'organization', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'who', 'claimed', 'was', 'immoral', 'hype', 'was', 'withdrawn', '70', 'percent', 'U.S.', 'theaters', 'premiere', 'Several', 'film', 'critics', 'time', 'called', 'most', 'pornographic', 'film', 'ever', 'released', 'film', 'studio', 'Today', 'however', 'very', 'few', 'would', 'likely', 'get', 'fuss', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'great', 'film', 'now', 'favorites', 'time', 'not', 'only', 'sexy', 'very', 'funny', 'well-acted', 'well-written', 'expertly', 'directed', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'dated', 'most', 'modern', 'viewers', 'personally', 'think', 'up', 'quite', 'well', 'then', 'do', 'watch', 'lot', 'old', 'films', 'when', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'produced', 'DVD', 'hope', 'studio', 'considers', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'audio', 'commentary']",N/A

238933,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6300273202,Only-A-Child,"[2, 4]","""Baby Doll"" (1956) was not just way ahead of its time. Somehow Elia Kazan managed to make and release what is arguably the most erotic film of all time to a Hollywood and a country more uptight and restrictive than at any point in cinema history.Even more remarkable is that this clich&eacute;d story, in the tried and true Southern Gothic genre, actually transcends its medium (film); visually fusing Tennessee Williams' literary themes and the assorted malignancies of southern history into an allegorical dramatization of Southern decadence and self-victimization.Southerners whine endlessly about their historical victimization but rarely exhibit the insight to put it all into perspective.  Putting this self-indulgence and self-destruction into perspective was what Williams was all about and he deliciously condenses his recurring themes into this screenplay.  Kazan was more collaborator than director; he understood what Williams felt and he knew how to make viewers feel the same things.The story is all about the invasion of personal space.  In the south this meant foreigners (from the North and from Europe) coming into their land and out-competing them.  The invaders were more lean and hungry than the natives.  They were less self-indulgent and more willing to invest for the distant future.  The natives were all about conspicuous consumption and short-term comfort.Even when forced to take a longer term perspective;  Archie Lee  (Karl Malden) has promised to restrain himself and defer the deflowering of Baby Doll (Carroll Baker) until her 20th birthday;  the southerner impatiently fritters away the opportunity to spend his time productively.  Then he finds that when the fruit finally ripens it is snatched away by a hungry opportunist.What to watch for in ""Baby Doll"" is the routine violation of personal space.  In the claustrophobic mansion the characters have no personal privacy.  It gets even worse with the invasion of Silva Vacarro (Eli Wallach); the characters are routinely in each other's faces and the camera captures it all with increasingly tight shots.  Baby Doll herself is not your standard movie nymphet coming onto an older man.  Once Vacarro has taken her measure, he assaults her in almost every scene, aggressively moving into her personal space as he hungrily pursues his prize.And like the aggressive Northern invaders, Vacarro's single-minded focus and pursuit of a goal soon overwhelms Archie; despite the fact that Archie enjoys the home field advantage and does not play fair, symbolized by the local Marshall who makes it clear to Vacarro that the law will not be applied equally.One scene that I particularly liked was when Aunt Rose (Mildred Dunnock) gives it right back to Archie at the dinner table.  She has been living precariously under his roof up to this point.  When he attempts to snatch away her safety she summons the dignity to stand up to him; and the camera gets tight on her face as she claims a bit more of his space.Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",5,Fantastic Screenplay and Film,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,3033,"['Baby', 'Doll', '1956', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'Somehow', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'managed', 'make', 'release', 'what', 'arguably', 'most', 'erotic', 'film', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'country', 'more', 'uptight', 'restrictive', 'point', 'cinema', 'history.Even', 'more', 'remarkable', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'story', 'tried', 'true', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'genre', 'actually', 'medium', 'film', 'visually', 'fusing', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'literary', 'themes', 'assorted', 'malignancies', 'southern', 'history', 'allegorical', 'dramatization', 'Southern', 'decadence', 'self-victimization.Southerners', 'whine', 'endlessly', 'historical', 'victimization', 'rarely', 'insight', 'put', 'perspective', 'Putting', 'self-indulgence', 'self-destruction', 'perspective', 'was', 'what', 'Williams', 'was', 'deliciously', 'recurring', 'themes', 'screenplay', 'Kazan', 'was', 'more', 'collaborator', 'director', 'understood', 'what', 'Williams', 'felt', 'knew', 'how', 'make', 'viewers', 'feel', 'same', 'things.The', 'story', 'invasion', 'personal', 'space', 'south', 'meant', 'foreigners', 'North', 'Europe', 'coming', 'land', 'out-competing', 'invaders', 'were', 'more', 'lean', 'hungry', 'natives', 'were', 'less', 'self-indulgent', 'more', 'willing', 'invest', 'distant', 'future', 'natives', 'were', 'conspicuous', 'consumption', 'short-term', 'comfort.Even', 'when', 'forced', 'take', 'longer', 'term', 'perspective', 'Archie', 'Lee', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'promised', 'restrain', 'defer', 'deflowering', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'Carroll', 'Baker', '20th', 'birthday', 'southerner', 'impatiently', 'away', 'opportunity', 'spend', 'time', 'productively', 'Then', 'when', 'fruit', 'finally', 'snatched', 'away', 'hungry', 'opportunist.What', 'watch', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'routine', 'violation', 'personal', 'space', 'claustrophobic', 'mansion', 'characters', 'have', 'personal', 'privacy', 'even', 'worse', 'invasion', 'Silva', 'Vacarro', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'characters', 'are', 'routinely', 'other', 'camera', 'increasingly', 'tight', 'shots', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'not', 'standard', 'movie', 'nymphet', 'coming', 'older', 'man', 'Once', 'Vacarro', 'taken', 'measure', 'almost', 'scene', 'aggressively', 'moving', 'personal', 'space', 'hungrily', 'prize.And', 'aggressive', 'Northern', 'invaders', 'Vacarro', 'single-minded', 'focus', 'pursuit', 'goal', 'soon', 'overwhelms', 'Archie', 'fact', 'Archie', 'home', 'field', 'advantage', 'not', 'play', 'fair', 'symbolized', 'local', 'Marshall', 'who', 'clear', 'Vacarro', 'law', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'applied', 'equally.One', 'scene', 'particularly', 'liked', 'was', 'when', 'Aunt', 'Rose', 'Mildred', 'Dunnock', 'right', 'back', 'Archie', 'dinner', 'table', 'been', 'living', 'precariously', 'roof', 'up', 'point', 'When', 'snatch', 'away', 'safety', 'dignity', 'stand', 'up', 'camera', 'tight', 'face', 'bit', 'more', 'space.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child']",N/A

The film (released in 1956) created quite the sensation in its day and was condemned by the Catholic Church. Although tame by today's standards, it is easy to see why the film was so daring at the time of its release. The heavily suggestive dialogue and sexual implications are easily apparent. ""Baby Doll"" is finally available on dvd and it looks fantastic.Filmed in Benoit, Mississippi in a dilapidated antebellum mansion (which still stands today), you can almost feel the heat drifting across the desolate landscape. Locals were used in some of the bit parts which adds even more authenticity to the feel of the film.The performances are top-notch with Carrol Baker breathtaking and utterly memorable as the unsophisticated child bride (""I've been to school in my life and I'm a magazine reader"") and Karl Malden perfect as the bumbling, seething husband whose jealously drives him over the edge. Eli Wallach is hypnotic as the revenge seeking opportunist and Mildred Dunnock is hilarious as the ditsy aunt who runs around trying to keep the chicken out of the kitchen and forgetting to turn on the stove to cook the greens. Baker and Dunnock received Academy Award nominations and it is unbelievable that Malden and Wallach were over-looked. This is one of the funniest films ever made. The scene where Wallach is running across the mansion with a pitcher of lemonade trying to scare Baby Doll is especially hilarious.I agree with the previous reviewer who lamented the lost opportunity for a great commentary since the principle actors still living.

This is the first film of his I saw on DVD and I was smitten by it from the start.  Everything about this film is perfection: sceenplay prepared after Tennessee Williams' play, cast, direction.  I remember seeing actor Karl Malden as older man in a movies of my childhood and it is just amazing to see him in a fine role of Archie in this film during her younger years as an actor.  And then, of course, the infamous part of the film on the swing.  I recall reading about it year after year before Oscar nominations, when film critics bring up the most scandalous moments in the american film and this one inevitably shows up repeatedly in their honorable mentions.  I will not re-tell the story in this film. What I will say is that story is unique and things that are not said, done or seen on the screen is what drives viewers to this film. Although this film is made after a play, this kind of production could never be produced in the theatre - and that is the best thing about the movie.  While people are fascnated about the actrss portraying character of a Baby Doll, I was fascinated by the actor Eli Wallach who gave his performance of a lifetime in this film.  From reading other reviews, it is a thrill to learn that Mr. Wallach considers this film to be one of his favorite ones in his career.  You MUST see this movie.

When the Meighans' furniture is repossessed after Archie Lee loses business to the new syndicate cotton gin in town, Baby Doll threatens to move out to the Cotton King Hotel. In desperation, Archie Lee burns down the competing gin. Suspecting that Archie Lee is responsible, the manager of the syndicate, Silva Vacarro (Eli Wallach), brings him his unprocessed cotton.  Archie Lee is delighted and he and his crew get right to work while Baby Doll is left to entertain Vacarro at the house. Vacarro seduces the nubile, young beauty and chases her throughout the house in a game of ""hide and seek."" When Baby Doll finds herself precariously straddling the attic rafters, Vacarro extracts an affidavit stating it was Archie Lee who burnt down the syndicate gin. Archie Lee returns to the house and senses the attraction between the two. He jealously stalks Vacarro with his shotgun but the police intervene. Vacarro leaves but promises he'll be back the next day with more cotton. Baby Doll tells her Aunt Rose, ""We got nothing to do but wait for tomorrow and see if we're remembered or forgotten.""Baby Doll is a wonderful black comedy. Carroll Baker's Oscar-nominated performance is extraordinary. I can't praise her highly enough. Her infamous scene with Wallach on the lawn swing may be the most sexually charged piece of filmmaking in the history of cinema. Karl Malden is fantastic as the frustrated Archie Lee. Kazan filmed Baby Doll on location in Benoit, Mississippi and the movie captures the racism and segregation of the deep-South in the 1950's. As in many of Kazan's other films, locals were used to lend an air of authenticity. However, there are times when the dry, staccato delivery of the non-actors is a distraction. Kazan uncharacteristically looped in quite a bit of dialogue after the filming, prompting the viewer to ask, ""Who said that?"" and ""Where did that voice come from?"" Boris Kaufman's Oscar-nominated cinematography is superb as is Kenyon Hopkins jazzy score. Tennessee Williams's script also received an Oscar nomination.The crumbling mansion used in Baby Doll is the J.C. Burrus House, built in 1858 and the only remaining antebellum plantation house in the area. Internet sources say the house was used as a Confederate hospital and headquarters for officers including General Jubal Early. The house is said to have been spared by invading Union troops because Judge Burrus was acquainted with the commanding officer. The last of the Burrus family moved out in 1914 and the mansion was vacant by 1936. After the filming of Baby Doll it came to be known by locals as the ""Baby Doll House"" and ""Hollywood Plantation."" The house continued to fall into disrepair until a restoration was recently begun by a direct descendant of Judge Burrus. Amazing photos of the restored mansion are available on the web.Baby Doll was an extremely controversial film at the time of its release in 1956 but is quite tame by today's standards. New York City's Francis Cardinal Spellman, a closeted homosexual with voracious sexual appetites, launched a personal campaign against the film. The Catholic Legion of Decency gave Baby Doll a ""C"" (condemned) rating eventually forcing Warner Bros. to pull the movie.Baby Doll is a delightful romp and my favorite Kazan film. This DVD unfortunately does not include commentary but has an entertaining featurette,""Baby Doll: See No Evil,"" with interviews of Karl Malden, Carroll Baker, and Eli Wallach. Carroll Baker (nee Karolina Piekarski) was a lovely and extremely talented Polish American actress who was never able to completely escape the notoriety of her Baby Doll character. In spite of this, Ms. Baker refers to Baby Doll as ""a very funny, wonderful, unique film that I am so proud I did.""",5,Kazan Romps With Baby Doll,1318636800,"10 15, 2011",2011,4321,"['Baby', 'Doll', 'Warner', 'Bros.', '1956', 'was', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'twelfth', 'film.A', 'middle-aged', 'cotton', 'gin', 'owner', 'Archie', 'Lee', 'Meighan', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'dilapidated', 'former-plantation', 'called', 'Tiger', 'Tail', 'film', 'beautiful', '19-year-old', 'child-bride', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'who', 'nothing', 'contempt', 'husband', 'marriage', 'unconsummated', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'promised', 'fulfill', 'wifely', 'obligations', '20th', 'birthday', 'entire', 'town', 'privy', 'Archie', 'Lee', 'predicament', 'greeted', 'ridicule', 'wherever', 'even', 'Blacks', 'When', 'Meighans', 'furniture', 'repossessed', 'Archie', 'Lee', 'business', 'new', 'syndicate', 'cotton', 'gin', 'town', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'move', 'out', 'Cotton', 'King', 'Hotel', 'desperation', 'Archie', 'Lee', 'down', 'competing', 'gin', 'Suspecting', 'Archie', 'Lee', 'responsible', 'manager', 'syndicate', 'Silva', 'Vacarro', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'unprocessed', 'cotton', 'Archie', 'Lee', 'delighted', 'crew', 'get', 'right', 'work', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'left', 'entertain', 'Vacarro', 'house', 'Vacarro', 'nubile', 'young', 'beauty', 'house', 'game', 'hide', 'seek', 'When', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'precariously', 'straddling', 'attic', 'rafters', 'Vacarro', 'affidavit', 'stating', 'was', 'Archie', 'Lee', 'who', 'burnt', 'down', 'syndicate', 'gin', 'Archie', 'Lee', 'house', 'attraction', 'two', 'jealously', 'Vacarro', 'shotgun', 'police', 'intervene', 'Vacarro', ""'ll"", 'be', 'back', 'next', 'day', 'more', 'cotton', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'Aunt', 'Rose', 'got', 'nothing', 'do', 'wait', 'tomorrow', 'see', ""'re"", 'remembered', 'forgotten', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'wonderful', 'black', 'comedy', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'extraordinary', 'ca', ""n't"", 'praise', 'highly', 'enough', 'infamous', 'scene', 'Wallach', 'lawn', 'swing', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'sexually', 'charged', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'history', 'cinema', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'fantastic', 'frustrated', 'Archie', 'Lee', 'Kazan', 'filmed', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'location', 'Benoit', 'Mississippi', 'movie', 'racism', 'segregation', 'deep-South', '1950', 'many', 'Kazan', 'other', 'films', 'locals', 'were', 'used', 'lend', 'air', 'authenticity', 'However', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'dry', 'staccato', 'delivery', 'non-actors', 'distraction', 'Kazan', 'uncharacteristically', 'looped', 'quite', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'filming', 'prompting', 'viewer', 'ask', 'Who', 'said', 'Where', 'did', 'voice', 'come', 'Boris', 'Kaufman', 'Oscar-nominated', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'Kenyon', 'Hopkins', 'jazzy', 'score', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'script', 'also', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination.The', 'crumbling', 'mansion', 'used', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'J.C.', 'Burrus', 'House', 'built', '1858', 'only', 'remaining', 'antebellum', 'plantation', 'house', 'area', 'Internet', 'sources', 'say', 'house', 'was', 'used', 'Confederate', 'hospital', 'headquarters', 'officers', 'including', 'General', 'Jubal', 'Early', 'house', 'said', 'have', 'been', 'spared', 'invading', 'Union', 'troops', 'Judge', 'Burrus', 'was', 'acquainted', 'commanding', 'officer', 'last', 'Burrus', 'family', 'moved', 'out', '1914', 'mansion', 'was', 'vacant', '1936', 'filming', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'came', 'be', 'known', 'locals', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'House', 'Hollywood', 'Plantation', 'house', 'continued', 'fall', 'disrepair', 'restoration', 'was', 'recently', 'begun', 'direct', 'descendant', 'Judge', 'Burrus', 'Amazing', 'photos', 'restored', 'mansion', 'are', 'available', 'web.Baby', 'Doll', 'was', 'extremely', 'controversial', 'film', 'time', 'release', '1956', 'quite', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Francis', 'Cardinal', 'Spellman', 'closeted', 'homosexual', 'voracious', 'sexual', 'appetites', 'launched', 'personal', 'campaign', 'film', 'Catholic', 'Legion', 'Decency', 'gave', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'C', 'condemned', 'rating', 'eventually', 'forcing', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'pull', 'movie.Baby', 'Doll', 'delightful', 'romp', 'favorite', 'Kazan', 'film', 'DVD', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'include', 'commentary', 'entertaining', 'featurette', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'See', 'Evil', 'interviews', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'Carroll', 'Baker', 'nee', 'Karolina', 'Piekarski', 'was', 'lovely', 'extremely', 'talented', 'Polish', 'American', 'actress', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'completely', 'escape', 'notoriety', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'character', 'spite', 'Ms.', 'Baker', 'refers', 'Baby', 'Doll', 'very', 'funny', 'wonderful', 'unique', 'film', 'am', 'so', 'proud', 'did']",N/A
238942,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6300273202,Westley,"[0, 2]","Elia Kazan directed two movies based on the works of Tennessee Williams - ""Baby Doll"" (1956) and the brilliant ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951).  Although ""Baby Doll"" is not up to the standards of ""Streetcar,"" it's an interesting film.  Carroll Baker stars as the titular Baby Doll Meighan, a 19-year-old child-woman who sleeps in a crib.  She married the much older Archie Lee (Karl Malden) with the caveat that they wouldn't consummate the marriage until she turned 20 years old.  The couple lives in small-town Mississippi in a huge old mansion in great disrepair.  Archie Lee runs a cotton gin that has seen better days and spends his days chasing after Baby Doll, who will turn 20 in a few days.  Archie Lee doesn't have much work because a newcomer to the community, Silva Vacarro (Eli Wallach), has taken most of the business.  When Vacarro's gin mysteriously burns down, he turns to Archie Lee for help ginning his cotton.  While Archie Lee is out of the house, Vacarro also seeks comfort from the sexy Baby Doll.  What follows is overheated southern gothic tripe mixed with some brazenly sexual scenes for the times.""Baby Doll"" is wildly uneven in tone and quality; some truly great scenes (Baby Doll and Vacarro on the swing) are undercut by confusing character motivation and occasional over-acting.  In addition, several racial epithets are used in the film, although in a seemingly satirical manner.  However, ultimately any debits are more than outweighed by the film's strengths.  Specifically, the script is filled with great writing and some genuinely funny scenes - Williams described it as a ""Delta comedy.""  The score by Kenyon Hopkins adds the perfect atmosphere, especially the jazzy yet menacing opening theme.  Carroll Baker steals the show by perfectly balancing the naive and flirtatious aspects of her character; Mildred Dunnock also scores as the clueless, chocolate-loving Aunt Rose Comfort.  They received Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively.  Eli Wallach is also surprisingly magnetic in his movie debut.  The scenes between Baby Doll and Vacarro really sizzle, so much so that the movie was condemned by the Catholic Church and taken out of most theaters.  Overall, ""Baby Doll"" is well worth a watch - an idiosyncratic and intriguing movie.",4,"""My head is swingin' round.
