It's not even the full show as at least the track ""Last night"" is excluded from this DVD that is so short already !!! Why such a rush job ??? Why not a cool tour documentary about the amazing year Justin had both on and off the road ? What about tour rehearsals and stuff like that ? A ""full"" DVD with the bonus CD as addition (for a bonus CD there's nothing to complain as the audio CD is a really neat extra)would be the package that was REALLY interesting.

779750,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B0000DYVRS,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 0]","There's something about Justin Timberlake that I like. Actually there are a lot of things, but watching him perform live proves what I was already thinking. The reason I enjoy him is because his talent is effortless. He has charisma (commonly called ""swag"" but ""charisma"" sounds more mature), he can dance effortlessly (unlike many of today's pop artists who look like they're counting steps) and he can sing his butt off. I love watching him live because he never looks like he's trying too hard. It's so natural. I miss him putting out music these days but the music he has released is so good that it'll be cool to listen to years from now. I think ""Futuresex / Loveshow - Live from Madison Square Garden"" is better because it's longer and we get more of his personality and his teams (and of course Timbaland) but this one was good, too. I loved all of his routines and songs, but I have to give it to his background singers for the most memorable part. The way they backed him up on ""Gone"" made me rewind and listen to it again. The background singers KILLED that performance. I love J.T., but round of applause for his team, too.",5,Why I'll always like him and his background singers,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,1135,"['something', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'like', 'Actually', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'watching', 'perform', 'live', 'proves', 'what', 'was', 'already', 'thinking', 'reason', 'enjoy', 'talent', 'effortless', 'charisma', 'commonly', 'called', 'swag', 'charisma', 'more', 'mature', 'can', 'dance', 'effortlessly', 'many', 'today', 'pop', 'artists', 'who', 'look', ""'re"", 'counting', 'steps', 'can', 'sing', 'butt', 'love', 'watching', 'live', 'never', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'so', 'natural', 'miss', 'putting', 'out', 'music', 'days', 'music', 'released', 'so', 'good', ""'ll"", 'be', 'cool', 'listen', 'years', 'now', 'think', 'Futuresex', '/', 'Loveshow', 'Live', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'better', 'longer', 'get', 'more', 'personality', 'teams', 'course', 'Timbaland', 'one', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'loved', 'routines', 'songs', 'have', 'give', 'background', 'singers', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'way', 'backed', 'up', 'Gone', 'made', 'rewind', 'listen', 'again', 'background', 'singers', 'KILLED', 'performance', 'love', 'J.T.', 'round', 'applause', 'team', 'too']",Justin Timberlake - Live From London
