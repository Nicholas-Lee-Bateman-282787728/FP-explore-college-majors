President Jonathan Hayes has a 16 year old daughter Jess, who keeps fussing about wanting to live like a normal teenager. She also can't cope with seeing Agent Alex Mcgregor and her father be so close and after an assassination attempt on the president and once the assassins get arrested he decides to let Alex, who saved him, take his daughter on a trip, where she could do all the outdoors stuff. Alex on the other hand has been demoted because her superior agent Daley thinks that she risked the president's life under the attempt. The only problem is that some of the assassin's fled under the capture of their leader and now want their leader back and they just happened to be in the neighbourhood of where Jess, Alex and a few other kids are for rafting and rock climbing... Yes Jess gets kidnapped and alongside with Grant (Doug Savant) Alex decides to become wonder woman and save Jess. The movie was good and I can't wait to see First Target.",4,Very good!

I thought that the film had a lot of action and suspense which kept me entertained throughout the entire film.  I'm glad that this is being released on video.  I also thought that this film had a great cast.  I thought that their performances were convincing and effective.  I don't think that this film was weak or depressing at all.  I personally enjoyed it and I think that it's worth seeing.,4,A great action film.,980121600,"01 22, 2001",2001,453,"['first', 'saw', 'film', 'TNT', 'liked', 'immediately', 'thought', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'action', 'suspense', 'kept', 'entertained', 'entire', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'being', 'released', 'video', 'also', 'thought', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'cast', 'thought', 'performances', 'were', 'convincing', 'effective', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'was', 'weak', 'depressing', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'worth', 'seeing']",First Daughter VHS
557358,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00004XPQ1,"""flickjunkie""","[3, 14]","This was lame even for a TV movie.  The best part of the film was the first five minutes showing an assassination attempt on the President of the United States.  After that, the film goes into free fall.Mariel Hemingway plays a secret service agent who is charged with guarding the President's self-absorbed teenage daughter on an outward-bound type trip of rafting, climbing and living in the wilderness for a week.  The bad-guy militiamen kidnap the brat and all the force at the disposal of the United States is coalesced to rescue her.The entire story is so contrived and poorly presented that it is laughable.  How lucky that of all the places on earth these militiamen could have gone hunting, they picked the same exact wilderness that the President's daughter was frolicking.  Moreover, it was even more propitious that they happened to have all their high tech surveillance, radio and radar equipment with them while they were bow hunting.It was also extraordinarily fortunate that Agent McGregor (Hemingway), who had never attempted rock climbing in her life before this trip, was so instantly adept at it that her next climb was a two hundred foot vertical climb without tether.  The ridiculousness they ask us to swallow continues unending.The action sequences were only fair, and the special effects were a joke.  The music was awful and the film would cut to black for five seconds between certain scenes where the commercials would be placed.  I don't even want to get into the acting.  Dreadful.Even action junkies will be disappointed by this film.  I rated it a 3/10.  Miss it.",2,Dreadful TV action flick,973123200,"11 2, 2000",2000,1595,"['was', 'lame', 'even', 'TV', 'movie', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'showing', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'President', 'United', 'States', 'film', 'free', 'fall.Mariel', 'Hemingway', 'secret', 'service', 'agent', 'who', 'charged', 'guarding', 'President', 'self-absorbed', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'outward-bound', 'type', 'trip', 'rafting', 'climbing', 'living', 'wilderness', 'week', 'bad-guy', 'militiamen', 'kidnap', 'brat', 'force', 'disposal', 'United', 'States', 'coalesced', 'rescue', 'her.The', 'entire', 'story', 'so', 'contrived', 'poorly', 'presented', 'laughable', 'How', 'lucky', 'places', 'earth', 'militiamen', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'hunting', 'picked', 'same', 'exact', 'wilderness', 'President', 'daughter', 'was', 'frolicking', 'Moreover', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'propitious', 'happened', 'have', 'high', 'tech', 'surveillance', 'radio', 'radar', 'equipment', 'were', 'bow', 'hunting.It', 'was', 'also', 'extraordinarily', 'fortunate', 'Agent', 'McGregor', 'Hemingway', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'attempted', 'rock', 'climbing', 'life', 'trip', 'was', 'so', 'instantly', 'adept', 'next', 'climb', 'was', 'two', 'hundred', 'foot', 'vertical', 'climb', 'tether', 'ridiculousness', 'ask', 'swallow', 'unending.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'were', 'only', 'fair', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'joke', 'music', 'was', 'awful', 'film', 'would', 'cut', 'black', 'five', 'seconds', 'certain', 'scenes', 'where', 'commercials', 'would', 'be', 'placed', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'want', 'get', 'acting', 'Dreadful.Even', 'action', 'junkies', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'rated', '3/10', 'Miss']",First Daughter VHS
