664298,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00005LPZK,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[6, 6]","This is the second movie from the popular &quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot; series.&quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot; began as a 48-episode TV series which capture the hearts of many anime fans. The show features a family of ESPers: Kyousuke, the main character, his twin sisters and his non-ESPer father. The show revolves around Kyousuke's life at a new highschool and meeting two roughneck gangsters: Hikaru and her best friend (tough fighter and talented musician), Ayukuwa Madoka. Hikaru loves Kyouske who loves Ayukuwa but despite her feelings for Kyousuke, she holds her emotions because of her best friend.Then came the six OAV's which led to the emotional rollercoaster movie where the love triangle had to come to an end.The movie picks up years later where an older and buffer Kyousuke is a professional photographer who is nearly killed in Bosnia. Before he is hurt, he manages to warn Kyousuke (a few years younger) that he is going to get a major accident and to be careful. When the two get hurt simultaneously, the younger Kyousuke ends up in the older Kyousuke's timeline with an older Madoka and the return of Hikaru. How will Hikaru feel when she sees Kyousuke again? How will Madoka bring back the Kyousuke of the present? Also, what will be of the relationship between young-adult Kyousuke and Madoka?For one to truly appreciate this movie, I highly recommend you watch the TV episodes or even the OAV and then the first movie. People just watching this drama may or may not enjoy it if they haven't seen the previous episodes but to truly enjoy this movie, it is recommended that you catch up on the previous episodes.As for the DVD, I'm disappointed that ADV didn't include any extras. ADV trailers, different language tracks and menu doesn't count. Also, how about showcasing the beautiful art from KOR. They could of included a gallery.But aside from that, if you want to watch the second movie from a popular anime called &quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot;, especially if you seen the previous episodes, this DVD then comes highly recommended!",5,Finally....Kimagure Orange Road on DVD!,1002931200,"10 13, 2001",2001,2064,"['second', 'movie', 'popular', 'quot', 'Kimagure', 'Orange', 'Road', 'quot', 'quot', 'Kimagure', 'Orange', 'Road', 'quot', 'began', '48-episode', 'TV', 'series', 'capture', 'hearts', 'many', 'anime', 'fans', 'show', 'family', 'ESPers', 'Kyousuke', 'main', 'character', 'twin', 'sisters', 'non-ESPer', 'father', 'show', 'around', 'Kyousuke', 'life', 'new', 'highschool', 'meeting', 'two', 'roughneck', 'gangsters', 'Hikaru', 'best', 'friend', 'tough', 'fighter', 'talented', 'musician', 'Ayukuwa', 'Madoka', 'Hikaru', 'Kyouske', 'who', 'Ayukuwa', 'feelings', 'Kyousuke', 'emotions', 'best', 'friend.Then', 'came', 'six', 'OAV', 'led', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'movie', 'where', 'love', 'triangle', 'had', 'come', 'end.The', 'movie', 'up', 'years', 'later', 'where', 'older', 'buffer', 'Kyousuke', 'professional', 'photographer', 'who', 'nearly', 'killed', 'Bosnia', 'hurt', 'warn', 'Kyousuke', 'few', 'years', 'younger', 'going', 'get', 'major', 'accident', 'be', 'careful', 'When', 'two', 'get', 'hurt', 'simultaneously', 'younger', 'Kyousuke', 'up', 'older', 'Kyousuke', 'timeline', 'older', 'Madoka', 'return', 'Hikaru', 'How', 'will', 'Hikaru', 'feel', 'when', 'Kyousuke', 'again', 'How', 'will', 'Madoka', 'bring', 'back', 'Kyousuke', 'present', 'Also', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'relationship', 'young-adult', 'Kyousuke', 'Madoka', 'one', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watch', 'TV', 'even', 'OAV', 'then', 'first', 'movie', 'People', 'just', 'watching', 'drama', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'enjoy', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'previous', 'episodes', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'recommended', 'catch', 'up', 'previous', 'episodes.As', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'ADV', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'extras', 'ADV', 'trailers', 'different', 'language', 'tracks', 'menu', ""n't"", 'count', 'Also', 'how', 'showcasing', 'beautiful', 'art', 'KOR', 'could', 'included', 'gallery.But', 'aside', 'want', 'watch', 'second', 'movie', 'popular', 'anime', 'called', 'quot', 'Kimagure', 'Orange', 'Road', 'quot', 'especially', 'seen', 'previous', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'then', 'highly', 'recommended']",New Kimagure Orange Road - Summer's Beginning
664299,AV7ATN4TN8AQT,B00005LPZK,"GeoX ""GeoX""","[3, 5]","Given that the original KOR movie ended the series pretty effectively, one would be forgiven for assuming that this followup would be nothing more than a wholly cynical exercise in dead-horse-beating.  And it is, to an extent.  The nominal premise of the film, in which Kyosuke gets displaced in time after being hit by a car, certainly feels forced.  However, as it turns out, the film manages to aquit itself fairly well, and, most importantly, it doesn't compromise the source material.It's an oddly paced piece of work, to be sure.  The bulk of it works at the probably inevitable task of achieving some sort of reconciliation between Kyosuke and Madoka and Hikaru, and then, this accomplished, it suddenly veers jarringly off into 'Kyosuke really, really wants to get laid.'  This first is done about as gracefully as one could expect; ie, fairly.  It threatens to venture into well-trodden 'allegedly comic misunderstanding' territory at one point, but, surprisingly, it dodges this bullet, for once.  Some may complain that the integrity of the events in the first movie is ruined by mitigating the quite violent breaking off of relations, but I don't really see that...it's only natural that, as time does its wound-healing thing, people should mellow out a bit, and, let's face it, Hikaru was treated pretty shabbily in the original; it seems only fair.  Not that fairness is always warranted, of course, but in this case it's all good.But then it just gets sort of weird; the material with Kyosuke wanting to have sex with Madoka feels very drawn-out and not a little pointless.  Firstly, I find the idea that they didn't consummate their relationship in the two years between the first film and this one VERY hard to swallow, even if we ARE dealing with Anime Romantic Comedy Land, which is known to be inhabited by the most superhumanly restrained people in the universe.  And secondly...well, so what?  I suppose the creators wanted to finish off the whole enterprise with a bang (okay...poor choice of words), but it's such an inevitable formality that I had difficulty bringing myself to really care.  And don't get me started on Kyosuke's impassioned, if not particularly coherent, little speech before the big moment.  I found the kiss at the end of the TV series to be much more affecting, honestly.What else to say...for unknown reasons, this film features new character designs.  Less cartoony, perhaps.  This doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would, but I still can't say I see the point, although the more mature-looking Hikaru is well-done, once you get over your double-take the first time you see her.One thing that I found a bit disappointing was the lack of a number of characters from the show.  Even if they weren't integral to the plot, it would've been nice to at least see them.  I mean, come on, guys, it's not like we're talking great art here; a little pandering to the fans wouldn't kill you.  Komatsu and Hatta make brief cameo appearances (which, let's face it, is really all one needs), but Yusaku--who I was quite curious about--is nowhere to be seen, nor are Kazuya or Akane (okay, so she was a minor character, but I still like her and wish she'd been in more than just a few OVAs), or, puzzlingly Kyoksuke's father.  But the ultimate insult: no Umao and Uskiko!  Come on, guys--get it together here.I suppose you could watch and more or less understand this film without having seen the earlier material, although I have no idea why you'd want to.  As for established KOR fans...well, what's the point in saying anything?  Obviously, you're going to see it.  And it is unlikely that you'll be particularly disappointed--it's not everything I could have hoped for, but it's not anything I would have dreaded, either.

664301,A2NWT6N7TXBGUR,B00005LPZK,Pierantozzi Luca,"[1, 5]","For those of you who don't know anything about Kimagure Orange Road, well, don't worry, this movie is still worth watching even if you don't know anything about Mr. Izumi Matsumoto's KOR manga/novels.  The animation is great and although a quite a bit different from the previous Tv-Serie/1st Movie which had the Akemi Takada character designer style its still almost top notch thruout the whole movie. Yep, there are some parts during the footage that could have been made a bit better, with more details maybe but the overall quality is still very very high. I really hope this DVD will have soft subtitles and will be totally unedited/uncensored/uncut to retain the original movie quality, any kind of censorship on Anime/Mangas in general would only be a great disappointment and usually a distortion of the author's point of view...Also buying the original DVD has the advantage to not only have an original version but an high-res one (hoping that they'll use a very good master for this DVD).What's really great about the KOR story is its feeling, its sincerity and what the main characters and the environment can give you, many true emotions that can't be described by words and you've to watch it--I really hope you will be able to feel the same emotions I felt from this movie and from KOR in general.

664302,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B00005LPZK,Stephen M. Lerch,"[2, 2]","I picked this movie up on a whim, having never seen the series before. I remember watching it and enjoying it quite a bit when I first got it last year, even without a fully developed backstory on it. Now, after having watched the TV series, I decided to watch the movie again and see if it was better/worse than what I remembered... and I must say that this movie is totally amazing, whether you've seen the TV/OVA series or not!This is a story of young man, Kyosuke Kasuga (Kasuga Kyosuke to we English speakers), who has supernatural powers, like teleportation, along with his sisters (his father doesn't have the &quot;power&quot; because his wife had the power and he married into it). Something the movie doesn't explain is that they are considered ESPers (people with ESP), so if you aren't familiar with the Anime term, you may not realize EXACTLY what is going on at the end of the movie (you sort of miss a &quot;joke&quot; without this information). Kyosuke, Hikaru and Ayukawa have been long time friends, Kyosuke having chosen Ayukawa over Hikaru when he finally decided who he was in love with for real, I believe at the end of their Junior High School &quot;career&quot;.One day Kyosuke receives a phone call from someone who claims to be HIM, warning him to &quot;watch out for the car&quot;. Heeding it no mind (as he is running late), he leaves his apartment for school. Well, as fate would have it, Kyosuke is hit by a car and sent to the hospital... in body anyway. When Kyosuke is hit by the car his &quot;spirit&quot; is sent forward in time 3 years, leaving just his body in '91. We learn that THIS Kyosuke is here and at the same time he was hit by the car, his self from this time (1994) was in another crisis, thus he displaced the 1994 Kyosuke.The movie revolves around the feelings of Kyosuke, Ayukawa and Hikaru (who never really got over Kyosuke) and the crisis of returning the 1994 Kyosuke to '94 (from a pocket dimension where time doesn't exist) and the 1991 Kyosuke back to '91.It isn't very often that a movie can touch me the way this movie, and this series, has. It shows the true power of people's feelings for each other and what they can do when motivated by these feelings. Very rarely do tears come to my eyes while watching a movie, and this is one of the few that has that much power and feeling behind it.Of course, I only wacthed the movie subtitled, and as such, Japanese voice actors tend to REALLY play their roles as actors, not just someone supplying a voice for a lifeless cartoon (like most Anime dubs).I really cannot recommend this movie enough. This movie is so much more than a good Animated movie, it's a GREAT film. Unless you are a hard core action movie only sort of person, you should be able to glean enough enjoyment from this movie to justify the price of purchase or rental, and if you're anything like me, MORE enjoyment than the price.",5,"More Than a Good Animated Movie, This is a GREAT Film",1024790400,"06 23, 2002",2002,2904,"['picked', 'movie', 'up', 'whim', 'having', 'never', 'seen', 'series', 'remember', 'watching', 'enjoying', 'quite', 'bit', 'when', 'first', 'got', 'last', 'year', 'even', 'fully', 'developed', 'backstory', 'Now', 'having', 'watched', 'TV', 'series', 'decided', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'see', 'was', 'better/worse', 'what', 'remembered', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'totally', 'amazing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TV/OVA', 'series', 'not', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'Kyosuke', 'Kasuga', 'Kasuga', 'Kyosuke', 'English', 'speakers', 'who', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'teleportation', 'sisters', 'father', ""n't"", 'have', 'quot', 'power', 'quot', 'wife', 'had', 'power', 'married', 'Something', 'movie', ""n't"", 'explain', 'are', 'considered', 'ESPers', 'people', 'ESP', 'so', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Anime', 'term', 'may', 'not', 'realize', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'going', 'end', 'movie', 'sort', 'miss', 'quot', 'quot', 'information', 'Kyosuke', 'Hikaru', 'Ayukawa', 'have', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'friends', 'Kyosuke', 'having', 'chosen', 'Ayukawa', 'Hikaru', 'when', 'finally', 'decided', 'who', 'was', 'love', 'real', 'believe', 'end', 'Junior', 'High', 'School', 'quot', 'career', 'quot', 'day', 'Kyosuke', 'phone', 'call', 'someone', 'who', 'be', 'HIM', 'warning', 'quot', 'watch', 'out', 'car', 'quot', 'Heeding', 'mind', 'running', 'late', 'apartment', 'school', 'Well', 'fate', 'would', 'have', 'Kyosuke', 'hit', 'car', 'sent', 'hospital', 'body', 'anyway', 'When', 'Kyosuke', 'hit', 'car', 'quot', 'quot', 'sent', 'forward', 'time', '3', 'years', 'leaving', 'just', 'body', ""'91"", 'learn', 'THIS', 'Kyosuke', 'here', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'hit', 'car', 'self', 'time', '1994', 'was', 'crisis', 'thus', 'displaced', '1994', 'Kyosuke.The', 'movie', 'feelings', 'Kyosuke', 'Ayukawa', 'Hikaru', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'Kyosuke', 'crisis', 'returning', '1994', 'Kyosuke', ""'94"", 'pocket', 'dimension', 'where', 'time', ""n't"", 'exist', '1991', 'Kyosuke', 'back', ""'91.It"", ""n't"", 'very', 'often', 'movie', 'can', 'touch', 'way', 'movie', 'series', 'true', 'power', 'people', 'feelings', 'other', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'motivated', 'feelings', 'Very', 'rarely', 'do', 'tears', 'come', 'eyes', 'watching', 'movie', 'one', 'few', 'that', 'much', 'power', 'feeling', 'it.Of', 'course', 'only', 'wacthed', 'movie', 'subtitled', 'such', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'tend', 'REALLY', 'play', 'roles', 'actors', 'not', 'just', 'someone', 'supplying', 'voice', 'lifeless', 'cartoon', 'most', 'Anime', 'dubs', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'enough', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'good', 'Animated', 'movie', 'GREAT', 'film', 'are', 'hard', 'core', 'action', 'movie', 'only', 'sort', 'person', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'glean', 'enough', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'justify', 'price', 'purchase', 'rental', ""'re"", 'anything', 'MORE', 'enjoyment', 'price']",New Kimagure Orange Road - Summer's Beginning
