This is one of those for me. I gained a new respect for Woody Harrelson due to the difficult character traits he has to portray and have the audience believe it - in fact, we as viewers are not sure of his belief system. One can see that the film's other characters aren't sure what to make of him either and as a result can underestimate or take advantage of him, which can be difficult to watch. As the film goes on, missing pieces in his background are filled in.I enjoyed it very much and although it is very different, which will limit those who see and truly appreciate it, I think the message it conveys resonated with me, which is what the best films do.I certainly recommend it to adventurous viewers and those who appreciate good acting and good scripts.",5,Unforgettable drama with some comedic elements,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,958,"['film', 'fans', 'know', 'feeling', 'finding', 'DVD', 'film', 'had', 'seen', 'trailer', 'thought', 'was', 'interesting', 'then', 'forgotten', 'even', 'made', 'mental', 'note', 'remember', 'one', 'gained', 'new', 'respect', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'due', 'difficult', 'character', 'traits', 'portray', 'have', 'audience', 'believe', 'fact', 'viewers', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'belief', 'system', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'other', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'result', 'can', 'underestimate', 'take', 'advantage', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'watch', 'film', 'missing', 'pieces', 'background', 'are', 'filled', 'in.I', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'very', 'different', 'will', 'limit', 'who', 'see', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'think', 'message', 'resonated', 'what', 'best', 'films', 'certainly', 'recommend', 'adventurous', 'viewers', 'who', 'appreciate', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'scripts']",Defendor

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[6, 8]","4.5 out of 5Arthur Poppington (Woody Harrelson) has a secret: when night rises upon the city, he takes to the streets as Defendor, a lone avenger on the hunt for the ever-elusive Captain Industry. Unfortunately for Arthur, he's mildly retarded and the line between right and wrong sometimes blurs. Though he means well, sometimes he gets in over his head, especially when his search for Captain Industry takes him into the city's underworld of drugs, guns and prostitution.After saving the life of prostitute and drug-addict Kat Debrofkowitz (Kat Dennings), Arthur takes her in and, though at first exploited by her for money, the two eventually bond and he accomplishes one of his objectives he had ever since donning the Defendor uniform: helping those who need it most.Being a lifelong superhero fan, there are a few things, to me, that define a good superhero movie and Defendor had more than one of those things. It touched me on that very human level of seeing a sincere human being trying to make a difference regardless of what other people think of him. Fear of man is one of the things I think holds people back from doing the right thing in real life. To at least see that attribute on the screen means a lot to me because it proves that people are still thinking about it even if it's just in a movie.The trailer for this flick makes it come across as more like a superhero spoof than a serious movie, and this was most definitely a serious movie. Sure, there were some funny moments, but this movie wasn't about that, but instead was about a man who saw something wrong and did the best he could with what he knew how to do.And he did. He showed us who Captain Industry really was: the villain that all of us have in each of out cities, the one comprised of drugs, guns and illegal sex that has ruined countless lives yet for some reason authorities refuse to do something about it.This movie makes me think of the real life superheroes that are out there (Google ""Real Life Superheroes""), those real men and women who don guises of other personas and do what they can to help us. Lots of people mock them. Lots of people mocked Defendor, but when all is said and done, they, like Defendor, do the right thing and try to right a world full of wrongs, bring hope to those who need it, and set an example that we should all follow.Defendor is a fantastic movie and I'm really glad Peter Stebbings went ahead and made this flick.Fight back.Recommended.A.P.

1326914,A2Z4B0VALQL9CC,B003626TNG,Cheese Steak Jimmy,"[3, 3]","*Minor Spoilers* On paper- there isn't a lot of originality here. The 'emotionally/mentally disturbed individual who gets in way over his head' archetype was previously done in the excellentSpecial, although the level of brutality reaped on Defendor/Arthur Poppington is more akin to what happens to Dave Lizewski inKick-Ass. The 'Hooker with a Heart of Gold' supporting character 'Cat/Angel' (played by Kat Dennings) is -on the page at least- so cliched that it's almost a moot point to mention it. Whilst there are a few twists in turns in the script, if I was an investor, I might have considered this too derivative of previous movies to bother with funding it.Which probably explains why I'm writing reviews on Amazon, and don't work in the film industry, as the people behind this movie did a great job. Woody Harrelson is excellent as Arthur Poppington, and turns in a subtle yet earnest performance. (Indeed, it would be hard to single out one actor for special praise, as they are all uniformly excellent, including the child actors.) The pacing of the film is great, the editing (with old School Star Wars-style wipes) thoughtful, and the DOP does an astonishing job with the lighting and the fiming, to the point where this movie 'feels' substantially more expensive than it actually was.There are only a couple of points that belie a tight budget- the score is good, but clearly done on a synthesier/with a band, as opposed to an orchestra, and the director Peter Stebbings shoots the whole movie in about four locations, doing his best to dress it up to look different (and the fake snow looks like polystyrene chips). Finally, the cover of the DVD is so bad that it almost put me off buying it- I wouldn't be surprised if people thought this was a DTV cash-in made on the heels of Kick Ass, instead of the low-budget labour of love that it clearly is.Whilst there are a load of movies in the 'kidding-themselves-on superhero sub-genre'(as well as the aforementioned Special and Kick Ass, there's also been the enjoyableThe Specials,Mystery Menand James Gunn's forthcoming Super) this is still an enjoyable (and emotional) movie that really cuts to the heart of what superheroes inspire in people. This film is ultimately not envelope pushing (but how many Superhero films really are?) but still enjoyable. More so than Kick Ass, it also makes me never want to put on a costume and try being a superhero- and one hopes that anyone tempted by the prospect of being a 'real life' superhero will pause for thought after seeing this [on a side note, an interesting but brief documentary on 'real life' vigilantes/super-heroes can be found in the special features ofWatchmen: The Ultimate Cut].",4,"Another love-letter to the flawed Super Hero, dressed up in 'Grim n Gritty'",1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,2702,"['*Minor', 'Spoilers*', 'paper-', ""n't"", 'lot', 'originality', 'here', ""'emotionally/mentally"", 'disturbed', 'individual', 'who', 'way', 'head', 'archetype', 'was', 'previously', 'done', 'excellentSpecial', 'level', 'brutality', 'reaped', 'Defendor/Arthur', 'Poppington', 'more', 'akin', 'what', 'Dave', 'Lizewski', 'inKick-Ass', ""'Hooker"", 'Heart', 'Gold', 'supporting', 'character', ""'Cat/Angel"", 'played', 'Kat', 'Dennings', '-on', 'page', 'least-', 'so', 'cliched', 'almost', 'moot', 'point', 'mention', 'are', 'few', 'twists', 'turns', 'script', 'was', 'investor', 'might', 'have', 'considered', 'too', 'derivative', 'previous', 'movies', 'bother', 'funding', 'it.Which', 'probably', 'why', ""'m"", 'writing', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'film', 'industry', 'people', 'movie', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'excellent', 'Arthur', 'Poppington', 'subtle', 'yet', 'earnest', 'performance', 'Indeed', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'single', 'out', 'one', 'actor', 'special', 'praise', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'including', 'child', 'actors', 'pacing', 'film', 'great', 'editing', 'old', 'School', 'Star', 'Wars-style', 'wipes', 'thoughtful', 'DOP', 'astonishing', 'job', 'lighting', 'fiming', 'point', 'where', 'movie', 'substantially', 'more', 'expensive', 'actually', 'are', 'only', 'couple', 'points', 'belie', 'tight', 'budget-', 'score', 'good', 'clearly', 'done', 'synthesier/with', 'band', 'opposed', 'orchestra', 'director', 'Peter', 'Stebbings', 'shoots', 'whole', 'movie', 'about', 'four', 'locations', 'doing', 'best', 'dress', 'up', 'look', 'different', 'fake', 'snow', 'polystyrene', 'chips', 'Finally', 'cover', 'DVD', 'so', 'bad', 'almost', 'put', 'off', 'buying', 'it-', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'DTV', 'cash-in', 'made', 'heels', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'instead', 'low-budget', 'labour', 'love', 'clearly', 'is.Whilst', 'are', 'load', 'movies', ""'kidding-themselves-on"", 'superhero', 'sub-genre', 'as', 'well', 'aforementioned', 'Special', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'also', 'been', 'enjoyableThe', 'Specials', 'Mystery', 'Menand', 'James', 'Gunn', 'forthcoming', 'Super', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'emotional', 'movie', 'really', 'heart', 'what', 'inspire', 'people', 'film', 'ultimately', 'not', 'envelope', 'pushing', 'how', 'many', 'Superhero', 'films', 'really', 'are', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'More', 'so', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'also', 'never', 'want', 'put', 'costume', 'try', 'being', 'superhero-', 'one', 'anyone', 'tempted', 'prospect', 'being', ""'real"", 'life', 'superhero', 'will', 'pause', 'thought', 'seeing', '[', 'side', 'note', 'interesting', 'brief', 'documentary', ""'real"", 'life', 'vigilantes/super-heroes', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'special', 'features', 'ofWatchmen', 'Ultimate', 'Cut', ']']",Defendor

But while you can't expect Woody's comedy antics a la Zombieland, expect one of the best performances of his career.By day, Arthur Poppington is a construction worker with a below-average IQ.  By night, he's Defendor, dishing out justice with makeshift weapons (reminding us in his gruff Batman voice that ""guns are for cowards"").  But while the movie starts out light and funny, it evolves into something both dark and sad.  With the flood of recent superhero movies, Defendor reminds us that reality isn't always so super.The real story here is the unlikely friendship between Defendor and a drug-addicted prostitute, in his ongoing mission to take down Captain Industry.  Woody is terrific in the role, bouncing between his wacky self and a vulnerable man-child who still believes in justice.For this being his first directing gig, Peter Stebbings hits a bullseye.  There's great cinematography and lighting, and Stebbings playfully throws out a few superhero flick cliches.  John Rowley serves up one of the best movie scores I've heard in a while, with a powerful and dark superhero soundtrack.  The supporting cast is also top-notch, from Elias Koteas and Sandra Oh to Clark Johnson (The Wire/Homicide).You will enjoy this movie if you go into it with the understanding that it's not a comedy.

1326919,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003626TNG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[3, 5]","In 2009, writer/director Peter Stebbings (""G-Spot, ""Across the River to Motor City"", ""Rabbit Fall"") known for his television work began writing a script on a superhero story.  But instead of being the usual superhero story adaptation from a comic book series, Stebbings went deeper to explore a guy, who has mental issues but driven by personal situations that make him don a costume and become a superhero.Next thing you know, the screenplay eventually grabs the interests of producers and also talent that the Canadian dark comedy/drama became a reality and four years after writing the script, ""Defendor"" was born and had its world premiere at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in theaters in Feb. 2010 and now available on DVD.VIDEO:""Defendor"" is presented in 2:35:1 anamorphic widescreen.  For the post part, the picture quality for this DVD is very good.  Would have been great to see Sony Pictures Home Entertainment consider this title for Blu-ray release but overall, the DVD features pretty good lighting during the night sequences and good detail on the scars of ""Defendor"".For the most part, despite the film having a low budget, David Greene did a solid job in capturing the character of Arthur Poppington, a man with not much money and living at his friend's workshop.  Capturing the seedy hangouts of the underground and more.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Defendor"" is presented in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Thai 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is dialogue driven and although there are plenty of action sequences, this is a film that doesn't sport explosions or anything significant in terms of immersive sound effects.You will hear a good combination of music to the action sequences, Defendor using his slingshot weapon and the buzz of wasps and also the occasional gun shots.  But most of the sound effects take place near the end of the film.But overall, dialogue and music soundtrack is clear and understandable.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Defendor"" comes with the following special features:* Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by writer/director Peter Stebbings, producer Nicholas Tabarrok, Woody Harrelson and Kat Dennings.* Deleted Scenes - (2:35) A total of five deleted scenes: Paul gives package to Arthur, Kat washes Defendor Costume Reporter finding Dooney cuffed to hand rail, defense attorney hits on reporter, Arthur talks to reporter.* Outtakes - (2:23) Featuring outtakes and the kind of fun the talent had during the shooting of the film.* Origin Stories: The Genesis of Defendor - (10:14) Writer/Director Peter Stebbings talks about the making of ""Defendor"" and both he and producer Nicholas Tabarrok talk about the changes of the original script to the final cut of the film.* Removing the Costume: Behind the Screenplay - (11:29) A featurette about what Stebbings wanted to accomplish and make different from the usual superhero films.* Heroes and Villains: Meet the Players - (20:11) The cast talk about why they took the part and wanted to be on the film, producers and crew talk about hiring the cast and more.* An Actor's Director: Working with Peter Stebbings - (4:56) Cast talk about working with Peter Stebbings and their joy of working with him.* Famous Last Words: Wrapping Defendor - (9:38) Writer/Director Peter Stebbings and producer Nicholas Tabarrok talk about the completion of ""Defendor"".JUDGMENT CALL:""Defendor"" was a delightful surprise.  When you come across superhero films about normal people donning a uniform and not based on a popular comic book superhero, more than likely the film is probably going to suck.  And the fact the main hero was played by Woody Harrelson was a bit confusing because I couldn't picture it.But after watching the film, not only do we get a well-written film by Peter Stebbings but Woody Harrelson and Kat Dennings absolutely shine in this film.Woody Harrelson plays the character of Arthur Poppington, an older man who suffers from mental issues and due to his mother being consumed by drugs, since he was younger, he has developed this hatred towards criminals and because his grandfather raised him with comic books, Arthur wants to be a superhero.This is what is so unique about ""Defendor"" is that, this man is a normal man.  No special powers, no major fighting skills but determined to fight against criminals and to get back at a person who may have killed his mother.Kat Dennings has been one of my favorite actresses as she brings this depth to her character in a film and with ""Defendor"", she really brings a depth into her character Kat, a drug abuser and girl living off the streets and pulling tricks.  She's never had any significant parental guidance, she is a victim of her father and people on the streets and when she meets Arthur, at first, she thinks of him as some type of kook but realizes his true intentions which are sincere, pure and that he actually cares for her.Overall, Peter Stebbings manages to bring together dark comedy and drama to ""Defendor"" and what could have been a major mess of a film to join with other crappy superhero films, ""Defendor"" ends up separating from those and becoming an entertaining film that is one of the better non-comic book superhero films out there.I absolutely enjoyed ""Defendor"" and if you are a fan of superhero films, this is definitely a film worth checking out!Definitely recommended!",4,"A dark, enjoyable superhero film.

Milburn ""davart1""","[3, 5]","Maybe it's my definition of comedy or dark comedy, but I generally think you should laugh or find something humorous somewhat regularly throughout a movie for it to called a comedy - but that's just me. So no belly laughs or 'OMG that's so freaking funny"" to be found here even for a dark comedy. Defendor has a couple of chuckle moments but nothing close to what it really takes to call a comedic. Some of the ""superhero weapons"" stuff are a little humorous once but just once then you've seen it, next please.Anyway, the general premise of the movie about a guy who is a bit of a simpleton and believes he is a superhero out to avenge a past wrong by Captain Industry and stop those that commits crimes on his behalf. Defendor is a strange blender mix of a little bit ofBlankman, a cup ofBatmanand just a pinch ofI am Samthat is overall a good idea just poorly marketed under the wrong general genera. Now to be fair it's not a bad movie and you find yourself just as the people in the movie rooting for Defendor to save the day and correct what is wrong in the city by night because by day he is a mild mannered road work. All in all Defendor (the character) is misguided from a troubled past but has a good heart and a great friend (Paul) that only wants to help him, a girl (Kat) whom is a crackhead hooker that he only wants to help, Dr. (Ellen) that really wants to believe in him, cops that barely tolerate him and various criminals that want to kill him. But what will happen to him?As I said it's a decent film, it's not a great film and I will not be adding to my collection anytime soon. Rent it if you want to, but you really won't be missing a lot if you don't nor will you be demanding your hour and half back if you do. Woody Harrelson turns in a good but increasingly typical not-quite-all-there-character in need of anger management performance so nothing new from him. It has a fairly decent script, and the acting across the board is good but the story just needed a little polish in my opinion but for a first effort by director Peter Stebbings it's better than most first efforts I've seen. I'm only giving it 3.5 stars as I'm taking one away for the misleading dark comedy tag and marketing and another half star for the rather choppy story line at times. The DVD has a few extras on it, deleted scenes, outtakes, featurette in which they admit it's more of a dark drama than a dark comedy and commentary which I haven't seen yet.So in the end... meh it's OK.

In the wrong hands this could have gone awry and played too much for the laughs. But as it stands here, it's a dark (gun metal gray) comedy but very, very touching.Woody Harrelson plays the title character who is a bit ""slow"" and fancies himself a super hero though he has no super powers what so ever. He holds a menial job on a city's street crew and is watched over by his boss. At night he tries to right the wrongs and do away with ""Captain Industry"" so the world will be a better place. This puts him in harm's way with a big time thug and a corrupt cop. But he's honest to a fault and his honesty doesn't go unnoticed.It's difficult to say how much I liked this film. Much of this has to do with Woody. Though I don't know if it's his best performance ever, I liked it more than anything else he's done. For my money he played the character to a ""T"". Yes, Defendor is slow witted but it might also be that he's just horribly naive. He has no wiles at all. He had a bad, neglected childhood, with a mother who succumbed to the dark side with drugs and booze. He was raised by his grandfather who just wasn't very good at it. Defendor wants the world to be a good place. A place he never had.I like Elias Koteas a lot and he does a good job here. I only know Kat Dennings from ""Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist"" but she's really good here as a girl who may very well go the way of Defendor's mom unless something or some one helps her change direction.The direction might be considered by some to be too ""meat and potatoes"", but I think that is what it needed. Too much over statement might have pulled the heart out of it. Here, you get to know the characters. Even as scummy as the Elias Koteas cop is, he isn't just a two dimensional bad guy. There seems to be a certain weariness to him.This is well worth the time spent to watch it. It's a very unique and well thought through piece with a good (maybe a bit sappy) ending.

1326923,A1OKNI3GDEP5EZ,B003626TNG,"G. Mosley ""Itinerant""","[5, 6]","""Defendor"" is excellent, but it is not easy.  The script updates and adapts Don Quixote, point for point, and it reminds us how Cervantes's simple idea remains a potent satirical and comic innovation.  There is very, very, very little sentiment or sappiness thrown about here, and all hands, from the prickly Dulcinea (Angel, Kat) to the wiser Pancho (Patrick), remains true to what made Cervantes powerful for being uneasy.The Don read the heroic tales, saw a real world gone awry, and opted to see it in the moral absolutes.  We have been conditioned by some damaging interpretations in the 1960's, where Quixote gets to be a sap, a dreamer, and a lovable loser, as he becomes a ""man of LaMancha"" or someone who thinks ""they might be giants.""  Cervantes's Don is worthwhile because he is, unquestionably, someone we laugh at, and yet we know why he does what he does.  Woody Harrelson has an enormous task in front of him:  he has to make a creature whose sympathy is in honesty and whose ridiculousness is in the same trait.However, by choosing to make this Defen-don retarded, we have an unnecessary problem.  Perhaps only a mentally retarded individual has the license to believe in justice?  Perhaps, satirically, it is ""retarded"" to believe in justice?  Perhaps it requires an inability to understand the complexity of society to see the truth of evil?  Regardless, it is a complexity of plotting and theme that adds to the difficulty of reception for an audience.The movie?  It's great.The subject matter is rated R, but that's the world.  The hero is rated G.This is a strikingly good film, both as a sneaky literary adaptation and as an apt satire of crime, capitalism, and lies.

Of late there's been a grip of these indie superhero films floating around, fromSpecialtoSupertoKick-Ass (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)to this one, DEFENDOR. And yet it's nice, frankly, to see Woody Harrelson command the screen again. That DEFENDOR is any kind of watchable can be mostly chalked up to Harrelson's ingratiating performance. You can't help but like the character he plays.Arthur Poppington (Harrelson) has had a miserable living of life, so that's one criteria of what makes a superhero that you can check off. Abandoned by his mom and mentally challenged, Arthur has sublimated his painful childhood into motivation for his crimefighting crusade. Arthur Poppington, by day, is a traffic controller - that is, he holds up ""Stop"" and ""Slow"" signs - at a construction site. He dwells in the construction company's workshop without authorization, and he can't really function in society. But when the sun goes down, all that goes away and Arthur becomes the costumed street vigilante, Defendor. Only don't tell him that's not how you spell that word.All these years, Defendor has prowled the streets, his overarching mission: to find his arch nemesis, that fiendish mastermind called ""Captain Industry."" During one of his night patrols, Defendor meets Katerina Debrofkowitz (Kat Dennings, awesome). Katerina is a young hooker, cynical and nursing a drug habit, who befriends him. More importantly, she has a lead to Captain Industry. In the dim corridors of Arthur's mind, this is the break he'd been looking for. He doesn't question the soiled dove. Off he goes.DEFENDOR is graced with a talented ensemble.  Kat Dennings, again wonderfully offbeat, makes lemonade out of lemon with her played out role, and she's very sympathetic. The supporting cast is nicely rounded out by Elias Koteas's dirty cop, Michael Kelly's construction friend of Arthur's, Sandra Oh's court-assigned psychiatrist, and Clark Johnson's patient police chief. In a film that doesn't boast a huge cast, these few actors lend weight and grist and help to constuct a convincing world for an addled superhero to inhabit.But it's Woody Harrelson's investment into his role that sells the film. There's a surface layer of comedy here, but you rapidly sense how potentially heartbreaking this all is. There's something sad and pathetic about Defendor, low-rent superhero. Defendor's homemade costume consists of shoe polish thickly applied around the eyes - and that's his mask - and duct tape on the chest crudely spelling out the letter ""D."" His weapons of choice are a World War I trench club, a supply of marbles, the occasional jar of angry wasps, and squirty lime juice (for interrogation purposes). When making his rounds, Defendor straps on a surveillance camera to his head, and it records to VHS tapes. Not having any real super powers, he copes about as well as you'd think out there in the unforgiving streets and dingy alleyways. That is, half the time, he gets his what handed to him. As the film becomes progressively grimmer, you can't help but grow very concerned for his safety, especially when he finally finds his Captain Industry.DEFENDOR is darkly funny and tragic. It's also a bleak deconstruction of the superhero mythos; it delves into what makes up the troubled psyche of someone who's actually abnormal enough to put on a costume and vigilante up. There's a deep sadness here that Harrelson is able to bring to the surface. And again it's Harrelson's playing it straight that lends Defendor's earnestness and pain and heart that certain resonance.Admittedly, the pace is on the slow side and there's not really a lot of action. This is more of a character study than a straight-up action film. But it's recommended viewing, to the tune of 3.5 out of 5 stars from me. And I guess there's something ultimately hopeful about not just an everyday bloke - but one with a disability - taking a stand and trying to do the right thing.

Woody Harrelson does give one of the best performances of his career in this movie and it is a quite touching story of a mentally challenged crime fighter, but anyone who didn't think this was funny must have a very, very, dry sense of humor. This was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long, long time. The first half of the movie was much funnier than the second half, but the whole thing was hilarious. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard at a movie. I feel sad for anyone who watches this and doesn't find the humor in it. I think too many people get depressed watching a Woody's near perfect portrayal of a mentally challenged person. They are missing the point. The point of this movie is to show how even someone as dumb as this guy can make a difference, all they have to do is WANT to make a difference. Perhaps one of the most heartfelt comedies ever, I really enjoyed how they were able to make such an uplifting and comical story out of such sad content. Woody's character is not only slow, but he lives in the real world, where people are not nice, and most people will try to take advantage of, or hurt, someone if they think they can. Yeah, it can be depressing for anyone who thinks that's not the real world, but those people are ignorant, and blind to reality. I think everyone should take away from this movie a sense of desire to not just stand by and allow the world around us to turn to $h*t. If someone like this can stand up to the bad guys, why can't we? This is not to say that everyone should dress up like super heroes, that ridiculous and not at all what this movie is trying to convince people to do. It simply begs us to question whether or not it's really that hard to just try to help people.

In the film, as a psychiatrist, one sees her fulfilling her role doing exactly that which is required of it: _listening_ to the other person (Harrelson's character Arthur Poppington).At one point she says to Arthur that he is a good person (and yet she recognizes he has ""limitations""). As he responds she communicates, with facial expression alone, that she -- rather, her character -- is emotionally moved by Harrelson's -- rather, his character's plight: a potential public danger because of his limitations, but a person not belonging behind bars.

Although the plot is familiar (a troubled man befriending a prostitute who deep down has a heart of gold as together they fight the good fight), this film tells it in a very unique way.  The included commentary was sometimes crude but proved enlightening.The last movie I watched with Woody Harrelson wasZombieland, so I was expected more of the same shtick since it was labeled as a comedy.  Instead, I was blown away by the great acting and storytelling.  I was amazed by Woody Harrelson's portrayal of the lead character.We are introduced to Arthur Poppington, a construction worker with a very low IQ, who niavely believes he can find the man (aka Captain Industry) responsible for his mother's death.  Flashbacks of his childhood are chilling as we watch his drug addled mother leave him behind.  When Arthur runs across a young drug addicted prostitute (Kat) during one of his nightly exercises, we watch them form an odd relationship.  Soon enough he is telling her all about his secret life as ""Defendor"" and his quest to track down the nefarious Captain Industry.  Kat tells him she can help but she has her own agenda as she steers Arthur toward the local Kingpin of crime. The police also have this guy in their sights and things do not end well as their paths inadvertently cross. Arthur is subjected to a pysch evaluation what with his secret identity as Defendor and all.  A lot is revealed as Arthur explains all.  The story is intense and kept me glued to the screen until the very last shot.  No typical Hollywood ending here folks.  I found the beauty in this movie to be that even though Defendor did not have any of the super hero powers he imagined, he did posses a real power.  Other characters and the ending pay tribute to that.After viewing the film, I wonder why it had a very limited theater release and grossed under $50,000 in the US.

1326938,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003626TNG,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","It seems today that real life heroes are hard to find. At least when it comes to ordinary everyday citizens. But the rare occasion does yield some true heroes which never seem to garner enough attention from the press. But what if heroes did exist? Not you next door neighbor type hero but an honest to goodness, costumed wearing hero? The answer is revealed in this week's release DEFENDOR.Woody Harrelson plays Arthur Poppington, a mentally deficient man who considers himself the protector of his city. In search of his arch nemesis, Captain Industry, Arthur takes on the guise of Defendor, a costumed hero wearing black pants and a turtleneck with a large D made of duct tape on his chest. With home made weapons that include marbles and a truncheon he got from his grandfather, Defendor takes to the streets, video taping his exploits and saving the innocent.Defendor's first innocent victim is Kat Debrofkowitz (Kat Denning), a young prostitute being worked on the street by Chuck Dooney (Elias Koteas), a dirty cop if there ever was one. Defendor gets the drop on Dooney and bashes him pretty good while ""saving"" Kat from him. She ends up coming back to Defendor's home, the storage facility for the city's street crew, bringing her crack pipe in search of a place to crash a few days.As Kat and Arthur begin to get to know one another, Kat plays him along, feeding him the information that he wants. When he talks of Captain Industry, Kat tells him she knows who he is and can help Defendor find him. The problem is that the man she's setting Defendor up to go after is an actual bad guy, an importer of girls, guns and drugs. While Captain Industry might be a character in Arthur's mind, Kristic (Alan C. Peterson) is an actual killer and in taking him on, Defendor will definitely get more than he bargained for.Along the way Defendor gets beat down by a group of bad guys working for Dooney which leads us to meet his ""family"".  Paul Carter (Michael Kelly) is Arthur's supervisor and friend. It was Arthur that saved Paul's son from an accident involving a car. Since then, Paul and his family have adopted Arthur to an extent. After the beating, Paul tries to persuade Arthur to give up Defendor and to come live with him.Criminals don't tend to forgive and forget though. While Arthur is healing, they've decided that he may have heard or seen something and to take him out of the picture. At the same time and undercover policeman is working the case to put these guys in jail. The chances of their paths all colliding somewhere down the line increase with each minute you watch.This movie works on so many levels. It works as a hero film with the costumed good guy taking on the bad guys. It works on a different level as the story of a mentally disabled man making his way in the world the best way he knows how, trying to do good where others turn away. And it works as a savior film where we have Arthur/Defendor doing all he can to save Kat from her current fate.The stand out performance here is Woody Harrelson. As Michael Kelly says in the DVD extras, you feel for him, you want to help him, you want to take care of him. It would be easy to overplay this character in the film and make him over the top. Instead we are presented with a fleshed out character not only helping others but in need of help himself. We want him to get help but we also want him to succeed at the same time.The rest of the cast does an equally good job though none stand out as Harrelson does. Kat Denning adds to her list of characters that come from a varied number of backgrounds and she does it well. Elias Koteas, once a hero himself in TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES as Casey Jones, has made slime ball characters his claim to fame and in this film you want to see him get his due.Don't be misled. The movie doesn't offer spandex wearing heroes combating evil villains driving suped up cars. Heck, Defendor drives a cherry picker with a Defendog on the hood. No, here we see the grim and gritty real world of the big city where people ignore bad things happening all around them. The best way to survive is to not get involved. But with Defendor as an inspiration, perhaps that might change. .",4,HEROES ARE HARD TO FIND,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,4197,"['today', 'real', 'life', 'heroes', 'are', 'hard', 'find', 'least', 'when', 'ordinary', 'everyday', 'citizens', 'rare', 'occasion', 'yield', 'true', 'heroes', 'never', 'seem', 'garner', 'enough', 'attention', 'press', 'what', 'heroes', 'did', 'exist', 'Not', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'type', 'hero', 'honest', 'goodness', 'costumed', 'wearing', 'hero', 'answer', 'revealed', 'week', 'release', 'DEFENDOR.Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Arthur', 'Poppington', 'mentally', 'deficient', 'man', 'who', 'protector', 'city', 'search', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Captain', 'Industry', 'Arthur', 'guise', 'Defendor', 'costumed', 'hero', 'wearing', 'black', 'pants', 'turtleneck', 'large', 'D', 'made', 'duct', 'tape', 'chest', 'home', 'made', 'weapons', 'include', 'marbles', 'truncheon', 'got', 'grandfather', 'Defendor', 'streets', 'video', 'taping', 'exploits', 'saving', 'innocent.Defendor', 'first', 'innocent', 'victim', 'Kat', 'Debrofkowitz', 'Kat', 'Denning', 'young', 'prostitute', 'being', 'worked', 'street', 'Chuck', 'Dooney', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'dirty', 'cop', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'Defendor', 'drop', 'Dooney', 'pretty', 'good', 'saving', 'Kat', 'up', 'coming', 'back', 'Defendor', 'home', 'storage', 'facility', 'city', 'street', 'crew', 'bringing', 'crack', 'pipe', 'search', 'place', 'crash', 'few', 'days.As', 'Kat', 'Arthur', 'begin', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'Kat', 'along', 'feeding', 'information', 'When', 'Captain', 'Industry', 'Kat', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'Defendor', 'find', 'problem', 'man', 'setting', 'Defendor', 'up', 'go', 'actual', 'bad', 'guy', 'importer', 'girls', 'guns', 'drugs', 'Captain', 'Industry', 'might', 'be', 'character', 'Arthur', 'mind', 'Kristic', 'Alan', 'C.', 'Peterson', 'actual', 'killer', 'taking', 'Defendor', 'will', 'definitely', 'get', 'more', 'bargained', 'for.Along', 'way', 'Defendor', 'beat', 'down', 'group', 'bad', 'guys', 'working', 'Dooney', 'meet', 'family', 'Paul', 'Carter', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'Arthur', 'supervisor', 'friend', 'was', 'Arthur', 'saved', 'Paul', 'son', 'accident', 'involving', 'car', 'then', 'Paul', 'family', 'have', 'adopted', 'Arthur', 'extent', 'beating', 'Paul', 'persuade', 'Arthur', 'give', 'up', 'Defendor', 'come', 'live', 'him.Criminals', 'do', ""n't"", 'tend', 'forgive', 'forget', 'Arthur', 'healing', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'seen', 'something', 'take', 'picture', 'same', 'time', 'undercover', 'policeman', 'working', 'case', 'put', 'guys', 'jail', 'chances', 'paths', 'colliding', 'somewhere', 'line', 'increase', 'minute', 'watch.This', 'movie', 'works', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'hero', 'film', 'costumed', 'good', 'guy', 'taking', 'bad', 'guys', 'different', 'level', 'story', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'man', 'making', 'way', 'world', 'best', 'way', 'how', 'trying', 'do', 'good', 'where', 'others', 'turn', 'away', 'savior', 'film', 'where', 'have', 'Arthur/Defendor', 'doing', 'can', 'save', 'Kat', 'current', 'fate.The', 'stand', 'performance', 'here', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Michael', 'Kelly', 'DVD', 'extras', 'feel', 'want', 'help', 'want', 'take', 'care', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'overplay', 'character', 'film', 'make', 'top', 'Instead', 'are', 'presented', 'fleshed', 'out', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'helping', 'others', 'need', 'help', 'want', 'get', 'help', 'also', 'want', 'succeed', 'same', 'time.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'equally', 'good', 'job', 'none', 'stand', 'out', 'Harrelson', 'Kat', 'Denning', 'list', 'characters', 'come', 'varied', 'number', 'backgrounds', 'well', 'Elias', 'Koteas', 'once', 'hero', 'TEENAGE', 'MUTANT', 'NINJA', 'TURTLES', 'Casey', 'Jones', 'made', 'slime', 'ball', 'characters', 'claim', 'fame', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'get', 'due.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'misled', 'movie', ""n't"", 'offer', 'spandex', 'wearing', 'heroes', 'combating', 'evil', 'villains', 'driving', 'suped', 'up', 'cars', 'Heck', 'Defendor', 'cherry', 'picker', 'Defendog', 'hood', 'No', 'here', 'see', 'grim', 'gritty', 'real', 'world', 'big', 'city', 'where', 'people', 'ignore', 'bad', 'things', 'happening', 'best', 'way', 'survive', 'not', 'get', 'involved', 'Defendor', 'inspiration', 'perhaps', 'might', 'change']",Defendor

It has some similarities to Super but came out earlier. Interestingly enough a series of flashbacks show how said superhero gets it totally wrong as to how his mother died yet never figures it out though we the audience get it. This is a dark tale with trace elements of humor and/or amusement. Like Batman the superhero refuses to use a gun and has to come up with cheap tools to defeat the villains. In essence, what ups the quality of this film is the mythological value of the hero's tale except in this particular instance it's the heroic tale of a fool, who sees and says things that ""ordinary"" people either do not see or refuse to acknowledge. The entire justice system is against him at first but it's fairly cool as how a lot of them come around at the end. Similar to Super this superhero has something of a love relationship with a damaged female.Fans of super heroes will most appreciate this film followed by those who are drawn to dark films that edge it out with comedy.

A sweet but dark combination of TAXI DRIVER and BATMAN, DEFENDOR answers the question of 'what if super-heroes' existed in a very sentimental yet mature manner. Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Arthur Poppington is just as worthy of an Oscar nomination as his role in THE MESSENGER. Harrelson's Poppington is a mentally challenged adult dealing with a very dark and tragic childhood by taking on the persona of 'The Defendor,' a comic book inspired super-hero. Writer-Director Peter Stebbings captures the true magic and meaning comic book heroes have in our modern society. Placing the innocence of Harrelson's Poppington/Defendor in the midst of a very real city suffering from corrupt cops, drug dealers, child sex trafficers and abused prostitutes makes for a very unique and adult viewing experience. The film is a sometimes lyrical poem, a sad reminder of how it is and how it would be for a real super-hero. Yet, unlike KICK-ASS, DEFENDOR is a reminder that there is value and valor in morality, courage and doing the right thing in the face powerful evil. DEFENDOR, like KICK-ASS, does goes for the laughs. There are moments of brilliant and hilarious humor to be found here, both dark and sweet. Unlike KICK-ASS, there are also moments of genuine sentiment and inspiration. The two films tell the same story in very different ways. It's a shame that KICK-ASS will make millions and become a pop-culture hit while DEFENDOR will have to tough it out on home video.

The story remains powerful and true to kids who read comic books, and Defendor reminds adults of that magic.Woody Harrelson stars as Arthur Poppington, an emotionally, socially, and educationally stunted man who works for a city construction crew by day.  At night, he dons a self-made vigilante costume to fight crime as Defendor.  He doesn't appear to be a very effective crime fighter: He gets beat up often, he uses kids' weapons (marbles, a slingshot), and he struggles to define and locate his nemesis, Captain Industry.The movie is successful, because the tone is strong.  Writer/director Peter Stebbings does not make fun of the disadvantaged Arthur Poppington.  Naturally, most of the other characters think there's something wrong with him, but Woody Harrelson never mocks Poppington's shortcomings, something I doubt Stebbings would have allowed him to do.  Excellent performances by Kat Dennings and Michael Kelly contribute greatly to the success of the film.Defendor is not a true comedy.  It has the guise of a comedy and even funny moments, but it's ultimately a drama, and one that is quite tragic.  Stebbings embraces all of the superhero and comic book lingo and clich&eacute;s, but he isn't making a comic book film (like The Crow or Sin City).

1326948,ANEDXRFDZDL18,B003626TNG,Serene Night,"[3, 7]","I picked this film up thinking it might be funny based on the previews. Unfortunately, I found it to be rather sad and depressing. Defendor is a man with some sort of cognitive impairment and is considered slow. He believes he is a superhero, and at night he goes out to battle crime. He is exploited by a teen prostitute who manipulates him into going after an ex-boyfriend who is a vice kingpin.  Defendor's mental impairment makes him believe bullets don't harm him and that he actually stands a chance against the villains he fights which results in him getting beat up. A lot. Sad. Eventually he becomes friends with the teen prostitute; however this friendship leaves a lot to be desired, since she has manipulated and used him.I guess I was looking for something else when I rented this. While it had some cute moments, overall, I found the subject matter a bit sad. I was hoping (based on them marketing this as a comedy), for an off-beat superhero drama. This film is not. It is a dark film, with an occasional funny part, mostly involving Defendor's cognitive impariment.  My favorite scenes were when Defendor was being evaluated by his therapist.Overall, I found this unfunny, sad, and not as entertaining as I had hoped.",2,Not a comedy,1272585600,"04 30, 2010",2010,1233,"['picked', 'film', 'up', 'thinking', 'might', 'be', 'funny', 'based', 'previews', 'Unfortunately', 'found', 'be', 'rather', 'sad', 'depressing', 'Defendor', 'man', 'sort', 'cognitive', 'impairment', 'considered', 'slow', 'superhero', 'night', 'out', 'battle', 'crime', 'exploited', 'teen', 'prostitute', 'who', 'going', 'ex-boyfriend', 'who', 'vice', 'kingpin', 'Defendor', 'mental', 'impairment', 'believe', 'bullets', 'do', ""n't"", 'harm', 'actually', 'chance', 'villains', 'results', 'getting', 'beat', 'up', 'lot', 'Sad', 'Eventually', 'friends', 'teen', 'prostitute', 'however', 'friendship', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'manipulated', 'used', 'him.I', 'guess', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'else', 'when', 'rented', 'had', 'cute', 'moments', 'overall', 'found', 'subject', 'matter', 'bit', 'sad', 'was', 'hoping', 'based', 'marketing', 'comedy', 'off-beat', 'superhero', 'drama', 'film', 'not', 'dark', 'film', 'occasional', 'funny', 'part', 'mostly', 'involving', 'Defendor', 'cognitive', 'impariment', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'were', 'when', 'Defendor', 'was', 'being', 'evaluated', 'therapist.Overall', 'found', 'unfunny', 'sad', 'not', 'as', 'entertaining', 'had', 'hoped']",Defendor

I think if the script writer had dreamnt up a few more gadgets like the wasp grenade and gone after the kickass type angle this would have been a brilliant film.

Good performances by the cast help bring together the movie in a way that allows yourself to care for them as individuals. However this film is not so outstanding that I can hold your attention the entire way through. I found myself pausing it at certain points to go about other things I needed to do, however I was always pleased to come back and watch it as well. Arthur, played by Woody Harrelson, is a somewhat simple minded man who's biggest crime is caring about others. While is a way he is seeking revenge it never seems like it is mean spirited, merely justified. Not so much an action piece as Kick-Ass, or even a dark or real super hero movie, this is more of a character study of the good will of certain people. Woody Harrelson's performance is the best part of the film and is quite believable. Defendor is an interesting movie, that may make you reflect on certain parts of your own life or opinions, and is very well acted.

I was expecting Kick-Ass with Woody Harrelson's character from Zombieland... what I got instead of a laugh riot was Kick-Ass meets Forest Gump, with a plot that moves slugishly forward but comes to the expected outcome. Clearly I was disappointed but I paid for it so I watched it to the end & I gotta say that overall it wasn't a bad movie, just was not what I was expecting.Basically it's the story about a simple man who wants to make a difference in a setting that everyone is miserable in but no one actually wants to get involved (He even takes some pretty savage beatings for other people) determination and redemption.Woody Harrelson plays this simple character almost to perfection. He doesn't undersell it in the slightest but he doesn't go ""full retard"" (Tropic Thunder reference don't start sending me hate mail) either.I'd have to label this a definite rent though... not worth keeping in the video library.",3,NOT a comedy...
