1576194,A3V2MJ7N8YIUMN,B008U1ANHG,blestgirl,"[28, 32]","I loved this movie so much the first time I saw it on Hallmark Channel last year! These are the things I loved most about them: Jules thinking of her late sister and brother-in-law's children Milo and Maddie to take them to Castleberry to meet their paternal grandfather and their uncle. Maddie softening her grandfather's heart by giving him a hug when she first meets him, giving her grandfather the Christmas tree decoration that once belonged to his brother that follows to the whole family decorating the Christmas tree, and Maddie dancing with her grandfather at the Christmas Eve ball that shows both of them are having a most wonderful Christmas. My favorite scenes with Milo are when he and his uncle Aston are spending time together (kinda in a father-son bonding) when Aston helps Milo learn to let go of his anger by giving Milo an archery lesson talking about growing up Aston had plenty in common with Milo by both of them have gotten into plenty of fights. The most moving part of Aston and Milo together is when Milo finds his late father's bedroom and Aston tells his nephew that his late father's love will always be with him. My favorite scenes with Jules in it are when Jules first meets her late brother-in-law's brother Aston and she knows it is him right away. I also like when Aston gives Jules a dancing lesson doing the waltz. To me the most amusing part of the movie is when Jules teaches Aston how to jam with rock-n-roll music because it shows to me that is when they become best friends. The most romantic part (to me at least) is when at the Christmas Eve ball, the orchestra plays the song Aston plays on his violin earlier in the movie and he refers to it as his and Jules' song when they begin waltzing then Aston follows Jules telling her how he fell in love, and their first kiss. The one part I like that shows the most self-confidence to myself is when Jules stands up to Arabella telling her that unlike Arabella, Jules and her family do not need money to make them happy. My favorite scene including Jules and the children's grandfather is towards the end of the movie when Jules tells the Duke that his late son and daughter-in-law are here with them through Milo and Maddie then the Duke tells his only son Aston that Jules is a very bright woman. To me the one part of the movie that shows me the Duke is more than ready for Jules to become his daughter-in-law is when he tells Aston to not let Jules go away. So as you can see, there are plenty of good things in this movie in case you have not seen it yet.",5,How much I loved this movie A Princess for Christmas,1349222400,"10 3, 2012",2012,2551,"['loved', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'last', 'year', 'are', 'things', 'loved', 'most', 'Jules', 'thinking', 'late', 'sister', 'brother-in-law', 'children', 'Milo', 'Maddie', 'take', 'Castleberry', 'meet', 'paternal', 'grandfather', 'uncle', 'Maddie', 'softening', 'grandfather', 'heart', 'giving', 'hug', 'when', 'first', 'giving', 'grandfather', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'decoration', 'once', 'belonged', 'brother', 'whole', 'family', 'decorating', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'Maddie', 'dancing', 'grandfather', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'ball', 'are', 'having', 'most', 'wonderful', 'Christmas', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'Milo', 'are', 'when', 'uncle', 'Aston', 'are', 'spending', 'time', 'together', 'kinda', 'father-son', 'bonding', 'when', 'Aston', 'Milo', 'learn', 'let', 'go', 'anger', 'giving', 'Milo', 'archery', 'lesson', 'talking', 'growing', 'up', 'Aston', 'had', 'plenty', 'common', 'Milo', 'have', 'gotten', 'plenty', 'fights', 'most', 'moving', 'part', 'Aston', 'Milo', 'together', 'when', 'Milo', 'late', 'father', 'bedroom', 'Aston', 'nephew', 'late', 'father', 'love', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'Jules', 'are', 'when', 'Jules', 'first', 'late', 'brother-in-law', 'brother', 'Aston', 'right', 'away', 'also', 'when', 'Aston', 'Jules', 'dancing', 'lesson', 'doing', 'waltz', 'most', 'amusing', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'Jules', 'Aston', 'how', 'jam', 'rock-n-roll', 'music', 'when', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'most', 'romantic', 'part', 'least', 'when', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'ball', 'orchestra', 'song', 'Aston', 'violin', 'earlier', 'movie', 'Jules', 'song', 'when', 'begin', 'waltzing', 'then', 'Aston', 'Jules', 'telling', 'how', 'fell', 'love', 'first', 'kiss', 'one', 'part', 'like', 'most', 'self-confidence', 'when', 'Jules', 'up', 'Arabella', 'telling', 'Arabella', 'Jules', 'family', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'money', 'make', 'happy', 'favorite', 'scene', 'including', 'Jules', 'children', 'grandfather', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'Jules', 'Duke', 'late', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'are', 'here', 'Milo', 'Maddie', 'then', 'Duke', 'only', 'son', 'Aston', 'Jules', 'very', 'bright', 'woman', 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'Duke', 'more', 'ready', 'Jules', 'become', 'daughter-in-law', 'when', 'Aston', 'not', 'let', 'Jules', 'go', 'away', 'So', 'can', 'see', 'are', 'plenty', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'case', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'yet']",A Princess for Christmas

1576198,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B008U1ANHG,Brent Butler,"[2, 2]","We watched this film last year because it had Roger Moore in it. While Moore was convincing as the crotchety and bitter European noble, we found so much ... well, more ... in this film, and when it played on the Hallmark Channel again this year, we watched it again.The plot is nothing revolutionary. There are orphans whose father was a disowned European noble. Their guardian and Aunt (mother's sister) is a struggling antiques sales lady on the verge of being laid off. Their Uncle (father's brother) is charming and impossibly wise, patient, and sympathetic. There is the strict head housekeeper, and of course the kids are painful screw-ups. Every clich&eacute; you'd imagine might be in a story like this is in fact in this story.Yet it works.It mostly works because Sam Heughan, as the impossibly wise, patient, and sympathetic uncle nailed his performance and gives you nothing but good vibes from the moment he first appears in the film. No misunderstanding, false accusation, outlandish behavior, or clumsy accident by the other characters is beyond his ability to put right, and in short order. Everyone would like to be that guy. LOLNow in his late 80s, Roger Moore looks good for his age and his acting hasn't suffered from his advanced years. We appreciated another opportunity to see this actor who we have enjoyed so much for so many decades.Katie McGrath seemed a bit out of her depth in this role, giving what at times seemed to be a nervous performance (as opposed to showing the nervousness of her character). Still, she was engaging and gave an enjoyable performance.So while this made for TV film has some short-comings, they are not severe enough to seriously detract from the overall impression this enjoyable if sentimental story will make on you.Highly recommended.",5,More than just Moore,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",2013,1791,"['watched', 'film', 'last', 'year', 'had', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'Moore', 'was', 'convincing', 'crotchety', 'bitter', 'European', 'noble', 'found', 'so', 'much', 'well', 'more', 'film', 'when', 'played', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'again', 'year', 'watched', 'again.The', 'plot', 'nothing', 'revolutionary', 'are', 'orphans', 'father', 'was', 'disowned', 'European', 'noble', 'guardian', 'Aunt', 'sister', 'struggling', 'antiques', 'sales', 'lady', 'verge', 'being', 'laid', 'off', 'Uncle', 'father', 'brother', 'charming', 'impossibly', 'wise', 'patient', 'sympathetic', 'strict', 'head', 'housekeeper', 'course', 'kids', 'are', 'painful', 'screw-ups', 'Every', 'clich', 'eacute', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'might', 'be', 'story', 'fact', 'story.Yet', 'mostly', 'Sam', 'Heughan', 'impossibly', 'wise', 'patient', 'sympathetic', 'uncle', 'nailed', 'performance', 'nothing', 'good', 'vibes', 'moment', 'first', 'film', 'misunderstanding', 'false', 'accusation', 'outlandish', 'behavior', 'clumsy', 'accident', 'other', 'characters', 'ability', 'put', 'right', 'short', 'order', 'Everyone', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'guy', 'LOLNow', 'late', '80s', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'good', 'age', 'acting', ""n't"", 'suffered', 'advanced', 'years', 'appreciated', 'opportunity', 'see', 'actor', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'many', 'decades.Katie', 'McGrath', 'seemed', 'bit', 'depth', 'role', 'giving', 'what', 'times', 'seemed', 'be', 'nervous', 'performance', 'opposed', 'showing', 'nervousness', 'character', 'Still', 'was', 'engaging', 'gave', 'enjoyable', 'performance.So', 'made', 'TV', 'film', 'short-comings', 'are', 'not', 'severe', 'enough', 'seriously', 'detract', 'overall', 'impression', 'enjoyable', 'sentimental', 'story', 'will', 'make', 'you.Highly', 'recommended']",A Princess for Christmas

1576226,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B008U1ANHG,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 3]","Each year, 'round the holiday season, the Hallmark Channel trots out its run of enjoyable Christmas family films. A PRINCESS FOR CHRISTMAS, which debuted in 2011, stands out from the assembly line, for me, anyway. I'm a sucker for any spin on that classic Cinderella fairy tale. And, yeah, while the resolutions to all the story conflicts are arrived at rather too conveniently, it's such a watchable picture that the flaws become easily forgiveable.In Buffalo, New York, Jules Daly (Katie McGrath) is a top notch salesgirl at the struggling shop Buffalo Antiques & Stuff. Jules is the young aunt to troubled teen Milo (Travis Turner) and 7-year-old Maddie (Leilah de Meza), and since her sister and brother-in-law passed away last Christmas, she's become the kids' legal guardian, as well. Understandably, the arrival of this new Christmas doesn't sit well with any of them. The final straw is when Jules gets let go from her job.At home Jules wallows in misery but then responds to a knock on the door. Outside stands the dignified English butler, Paisley Winterbottom.- Jules: ""I thought butlers were extinct.""- Paisley Winterbottom: ""Oh, no, we've made a comeback. P. Diddy has three.""And this is when we learn that Jules' sister had married into royalty, her husband being the disowned son of an English lord. Jules is informed that the aged Duke of Castlebury Hall (Roger Moore) is at death's door and wishes to see his grandchildren for the holidays. A fiery Jules initially wants no truck with the royal nibs what had turned his back on her family. But times are desperate...In England Jules and the kids arrive at an imposing castle stocked with a full assembly of beaming servants (okay, not all the servants were beaming). The awed Yanks find themselves in elegant surroundings, except that it's a residence in which the spirit of Christmas isn't observed. The old Duke is bitter and foul-tempered and cannot countenance holiday cheer. He's having second thoughts about his inviting over his estranged grandchildren from across the pond. You see, the kids dredge up too many sad memories of his dead son. His second and lesser favored son, the dashing Prince Ashton, has also dropped by for a visit. So there's even more of that stiff-upper-lipped forced politeness going on. Prince Ashton has brought along his snooty girlfriend who takes an immediate dislike to Jules. And, old as you are in the ways of romantic cinema, you sense where that narrative is going.A PRINCESS FOR CHRISTMAS tells of the mending of a family rift. It tells of the thawing of a miserable regal curmudgeon, and the bonds that grow amongst the castle residents, and, of course, it tells of a fairy tale type romance. There's hokey stuff, plenty of it, but there's also so much warmth and the cast is very appealing. Katie McGrath, whom you may best know as Morgana from MERLIN, effortlessly shines. She creates some nice sparks with Sam Heughan who plays the surprisingly down-to-earth prince. There's a thoroughly cute sequence that encompasses three rooms: one in which Maddie studies ballet, another in which Milo practices electric guitar, and a third room in which Ashton teaches Jules the waltz which then devolves into Jules and the prince's funking it out to hip-hop music. This scene could've gone down real cheesy if the actors weren't so good and natural in the moment. In fact, that scene embodies how I feel about the film. It could so very easily have strayed into cringe-inducing hokum territory. But it manages to sidestep all potential pitfalls. With regards to modern takes on Cinderella, A PRINCESS FOR CHRISTMAS ranks as one of the more terrific ones.",4,...a Buffalo girl goes to the royal ball...,1354406400,"12 2, 2012",2012,3658,"['year', 'holiday', 'season', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'out', 'run', 'enjoyable', 'Christmas', 'family', 'films', 'PRINCESS', 'FOR', 'CHRISTMAS', 'debuted', '2011', 'out', 'assembly', 'line', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'spin', 'classic', 'Cinderella', 'fairy', 'tale', 'yeah', 'resolutions', 'story', 'conflicts', 'are', 'arrived', 'rather', 'too', 'conveniently', 'such', 'watchable', 'picture', 'flaws', 'become', 'easily', 'forgiveable.In', 'Buffalo', 'New', 'York', 'Jules', 'Daly', 'Katie', 'McGrath', 'top', 'notch', 'salesgirl', 'struggling', 'shop', 'Buffalo', 'Antiques', 'Stuff', 'Jules', 'young', 'aunt', 'troubled', 'teen', 'Milo', 'Travis', 'Turner', '7-year-old', 'Maddie', 'Leilah', 'de', 'Meza', 'sister', 'brother-in-law', 'passed', 'away', 'last', 'Christmas', 'become', 'kids', 'legal', 'guardian', 'as', 'well', 'Understandably', 'arrival', 'new', 'Christmas', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'final', 'straw', 'when', 'Jules', 'let', 'go', 'job.At', 'home', 'Jules', 'misery', 'then', 'knock', 'door', 'dignified', 'English', 'butler', 'Paisley', 'Winterbottom.-', 'Jules', 'thought', 'butlers', 'were', 'extinct', 'Paisley', 'Winterbottom', 'Oh', ""'ve"", 'made', 'comeback', 'P.', 'Diddy', 'three', 'when', 'learn', 'Jules', 'sister', 'had', 'married', 'royalty', 'husband', 'being', 'disowned', 'son', 'English', 'lord', 'Jules', 'informed', 'aged', 'Duke', 'Castlebury', 'Hall', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'death', 'door', 'wishes', 'see', 'grandchildren', 'holidays', 'fiery', 'Jules', 'initially', 'truck', 'royal', 'nibs', 'what', 'had', 'turned', 'back', 'family', 'times', 'are', 'desperate', 'England', 'Jules', 'kids', 'arrive', 'imposing', 'castle', 'stocked', 'full', 'assembly', 'beaming', 'servants', 'okay', 'not', 'servants', 'were', 'beaming', 'awed', 'Yanks', 'find', 'elegant', 'surroundings', 'residence', 'spirit', 'Christmas', ""n't"", 'observed', 'old', 'Duke', 'bitter', 'foul-tempered', 'can', 'not', 'countenance', 'holiday', 'cheer', 'having', 'second', 'thoughts', 'inviting', 'estranged', 'grandchildren', 'pond', 'see', 'kids', 'dredge', 'up', 'too', 'many', 'sad', 'memories', 'dead', 'son', 'second', 'lesser', 'favored', 'son', 'dashing', 'Prince', 'Ashton', 'also', 'dropped', 'visit', 'even', 'more', 'stiff-upper-lipped', 'forced', 'politeness', 'going', 'Prince', 'Ashton', 'brought', 'snooty', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'immediate', 'dislike', 'Jules', 'old', 'are', 'ways', 'romantic', 'cinema', 'sense', 'where', 'narrative', 'going.A', 'PRINCESS', 'FOR', 'CHRISTMAS', 'tells', 'mending', 'family', 'rift', 'thawing', 'miserable', 'regal', 'curmudgeon', 'bonds', 'grow', 'castle', 'residents', 'course', 'fairy', 'tale', 'type', 'romance', 'hokey', 'stuff', 'plenty', 'also', 'so', 'much', 'warmth', 'cast', 'very', 'appealing', 'Katie', 'McGrath', 'whom', 'may', 'best', 'know', 'Morgana', 'MERLIN', 'effortlessly', 'shines', 'nice', 'sparks', 'Sam', 'Heughan', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'down-to-earth', 'prince', 'thoroughly', 'cute', 'sequence', 'three', 'rooms', 'one', 'Maddie', 'studies', 'ballet', 'Milo', 'practices', 'electric', 'guitar', 'third', 'room', 'Ashton', 'Jules', 'waltz', 'then', 'Jules', 'prince', 'funking', 'hip-hop', 'music', 'scene', 'could', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'down', 'real', 'cheesy', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'good', 'natural', 'moment', 'fact', 'scene', 'how', 'feel', 'film', 'could', 'so', 'very', 'easily', 'have', 'strayed', 'cringe-inducing', 'hokum', 'territory', 'sidestep', 'potential', 'pitfalls', 'regards', 'modern', 'Cinderella', 'A', 'PRINCESS', 'FOR', 'CHRISTMAS', 'one', 'more', 'terrific', 'ones']",A Princess for Christmas

1576233,AXUDXQFT83YO9,B008U1ANHG,"John Gough ""John Gough - Deakin University""","[2, 3]","Some reviewers have been bored by this film.What did they expect? The title is either a deliberate lie, or the film is about a Princess and Christmas!It is a story that virtually writes itself, especially after the first few scenes.But what follows is NOT great suspense. It's ""How will they get together and heal the family?""Finding out HOW can be as engaging as cliff-hanging thrills or high drama -- but you have to be willing to go along for the ride.You have to overlook the fact that Roger Moore is in his eighties, and looks it, but is supposed to have a son in his young thirties or late twenties. (Biologically possible, but unusual.) Fortunately Moore can still speak and act with authority, so his screen presence outweighs the wrinkles and thin colored hair.You have to overlook the fact that a supposedly European castle and aristocratic titles are decidely English, at least in language.Similarly you have to overlook the fact that almost all the Christmas carols are traditional British, and the village orphan choir sings in English.You have to overlook the fact that the waltz the two young-people-destined-for-each-other dance to, which the young man has declared is, or is about to be, ""their song"", is the classic Wedding Waltz (""Oh, how we danced, on the night, we were wed, ..."") This can be off-set by the soulful way the young man as been inspired, earlier, by his sudden feelings for the young girl to begin playing his violin again: Jules Massanet's haunting ""Meditation"", from the opera ""Thais"".You have to overlook the way Vivaldi violin concertos, from ""The Four Seasons"", are used as background music, but not credited in the list of music used in the film. (But I am a pedant who looks for these details.)This may seem a lot of overlooking.But the film says ""Christmas"" very early and clearly.It also says, ""Family mourning"", and ""family schism"", and ""hope for redemption, forgiveness, and reconciliation"".So we have many emotionally convincing reasons to overlook trivial matters.We should also overlook the way this situation replays the better made, slightly more plausible ""Princess Diaries"".In short, this film works well enough.For me it is FOUR STARS because FIVE must be reserved for really GREAT Christmas family-healing, and romance-fixing, films such as ""Silver Bells"" and ""The Christmas Card"" almost any version of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street"".But FOUR STARS are fine!One final nice joke: mid-way through, American antique-expert maiden versus snobby prince-chasing would-be princess: as water cress and cucumber sandwiches are served after the drag-scent mock fox hunting, the American girl identifies the designer of the sandwich plate, but the snobby girl claimns this is wrong. Once the American girl leaves, a sympathetic fellow turns over the plate -- the American girl was write, this is a (I forget the name) ""Lindsay Whatever"". At the end, if you watch the credits closely, ""Lindsay Whatever"" is actually one of the Assistant Producers.Incidentally, Wikipedia states that the film was shot at Pele Castle, Stirbei Castle, the Bragadiru Palace, and in a Romanian film studio.",4,Predictable needn't mean boring: sentiment can be emotive,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,3146,"['reviewers', 'have', 'been', 'bored', 'did', 'expect', 'title', 'deliberate', 'lie', 'film', 'Princess', 'Christmas', 'story', 'virtually', 'especially', 'first', 'few', 'scenes.But', 'what', 'NOT', 'great', 'suspense', 'How', 'will', 'get', 'together', 'heal', 'family', 'Finding', 'out', 'HOW', 'can', 'be', 'as', 'engaging', 'cliff-hanging', 'thrills', 'high', 'drama', 'have', 'be', 'willing', 'go', 'along', 'ride.You', 'have', 'overlook', 'fact', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'eighties', 'supposed', 'have', 'son', 'young', 'thirties', 'late', 'twenties', 'Biologically', 'possible', 'unusual', 'Fortunately', 'Moore', 'can', 'still', 'speak', 'act', 'authority', 'screen', 'presence', 'wrinkles', 'thin', 'colored', 'hair.You', 'have', 'overlook', 'fact', 'supposedly', 'European', 'castle', 'aristocratic', 'titles', 'are', 'decidely', 'English', 'least', 'language.Similarly', 'have', 'overlook', 'fact', 'almost', 'Christmas', 'carols', 'are', 'traditional', 'British', 'village', 'orphan', 'choir', 'sings', 'English.You', 'have', 'overlook', 'fact', 'waltz', 'two', 'young-people-destined-for-each-other', 'dance', 'young', 'man', 'declared', 'be', 'song', 'classic', 'Wedding', 'Waltz', 'Oh', 'how', 'danced', 'night', 'were', 'wed', 'can', 'be', 'off-set', 'soulful', 'way', 'young', 'man', 'been', 'inspired', 'earlier', 'sudden', 'feelings', 'young', 'girl', 'begin', 'playing', 'violin', 'again', 'Jules', 'Massanet', 'haunting', 'Meditation', 'opera', 'Thais', '.You', 'have', 'overlook', 'way', 'Vivaldi', 'violin', 'concertos', 'Four', 'Seasons', 'are', 'used', 'background', 'music', 'not', 'credited', 'list', 'music', 'used', 'film', 'am', 'pedant', 'who', 'details', 'may', 'seem', 'lot', 'film', 'Christmas', 'very', 'early', 'clearly.It', 'also', 'Family', 'mourning', 'family', 'schism', 'hope', 'redemption', 'forgiveness', 'reconciliation', '.So', 'have', 'many', 'emotionally', 'convincing', 'reasons', 'overlook', 'trivial', 'matters.We', 'should', 'also', 'overlook', 'way', 'situation', 'better', 'made', 'slightly', 'more', 'plausible', 'Princess', 'Diaries', '.In', 'short', 'film', 'well', 'enough.For', 'FOUR', 'STARS', 'FIVE', 'must', 'be', 'reserved', 'really', 'GREAT', 'Christmas', 'family-healing', 'romance-fixing', 'films', 'such', 'Silver', 'Bells', 'Christmas', 'Card', 'almost', 'version', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'Miracle', '34th', 'Street', 'FOUR', 'STARS', 'are', 'fine', 'One', 'final', 'nice', 'joke', 'mid-way', 'American', 'antique-expert', 'maiden', 'versus', 'snobby', 'prince-chasing', 'would-be', 'princess', 'water', 'cress', 'cucumber', 'sandwiches', 'are', 'served', 'drag-scent', 'mock', 'fox', 'hunting', 'American', 'girl', 'designer', 'sandwich', 'plate', 'snobby', 'girl', 'claimns', 'wrong', 'Once', 'American', 'girl', 'leaves', 'sympathetic', 'fellow', 'plate', 'American', 'girl', 'was', 'write', 'forget', 'name', 'Lindsay', 'Whatever', 'end', 'watch', 'credits', 'closely', 'Lindsay', 'actually', 'one', 'Assistant', 'Producers.Incidentally', 'Wikipedia', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Pele', 'Castle', 'Stirbei', 'Castle', 'Bragadiru', 'Palace', 'Romanian', 'film', 'studio']",A Princess for Christmas

Olsen,"[34, 37]","Jules works in an antique shop and serves as legal guardian for her precocious 7-year-old niece and troubled teenage nephew, whose parents have died. When the movie opens with Jules losing her job, the nephew stealing from a store, and the niece running off the nanny, I wasn't sure this was the kind of holiday ""cheer"" I needed. But a knock comes at the door and there is the mysterious man whom we have seen watching her earlier in the day.  We learn that Jules' deceased sister had married into nobility, but because she was without title, her father-in-law had disowned the couple. Now, supposedly near death, he wants to know his grandchildren and has sent the butler to fetch them to Castlebury Hall. Jules struggles with the decision of whether or not to go, but upon the arrival of the tickets for the trip in a rather timely manner, she takes that as a sign that they are to go.At the castle it appears that the old gentleman, the duke, is not as near death's door as had been implied and Jules begins to wonder why they were summoned in the first place.Now, if you can suspend disbelief and just enjoy the fairy tale, it is good family fun, with a little romance thrown in. You won't have to cover your ears or hide your eyes, just relax and let the Cinderella story unfold in the magical setting. I admit that the storyline was a little trite to me--stuffy, titled family turned on its ear by an outspoken, unpretentious American with cute children in the mix. The servants are all charmed by them, and there is a very predictable outcome. But it is well-played and heartwarming. Grandpa (Roger Moore) even softens and allows a Christmas tree, which he ultimately helps decorate.  There are ballet lessons, archery instructions, a fox-hunt that isn't really a fox-hunt, and a Christmas Eve Ball, where some social climbers get their comeuppance. Don't over-analyze the believability, just enjoy a good, clean holiday-themed story with emphasis on the importance of family.",4,A Modern Day Christmas Fairy Tale,1349136000,"10 2, 2012",2012,1983,"['Jules', 'works', 'antique', 'shop', 'serves', 'legal', 'guardian', 'precocious', '7-year-old', 'niece', 'troubled', 'teenage', 'nephew', 'parents', 'have', 'died', 'When', 'movie', 'Jules', 'losing', 'job', 'nephew', 'stealing', 'store', 'niece', 'running', 'off', 'nanny', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'kind', 'holiday', 'cheer', 'needed', 'knock', 'door', 'mysterious', 'man', 'whom', 'have', 'seen', 'watching', 'earlier', 'day', 'learn', 'Jules', 'deceased', 'sister', 'had', 'married', 'nobility', 'was', 'title', 'father-in-law', 'had', 'disowned', 'couple', 'Now', 'supposedly', 'death', 'know', 'grandchildren', 'sent', 'butler', 'fetch', 'Castlebury', 'Hall', 'Jules', 'decision', 'not', 'go', 'arrival', 'tickets', 'trip', 'rather', 'timely', 'manner', 'sign', 'are', 'go.At', 'castle', 'old', 'gentleman', 'duke', 'not', 'death', 'door', 'had', 'been', 'implied', 'Jules', 'wonder', 'why', 'were', 'summoned', 'first', 'place.Now', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'just', 'enjoy', 'fairy', 'tale', 'good', 'family', 'fun', 'little', 'romance', 'thrown', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'cover', 'ears', 'hide', 'eyes', 'just', 'relax', 'let', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'unfold', 'magical', 'setting', 'admit', 'storyline', 'was', 'little', 'trite', 'stuffy', 'titled', 'family', 'turned', 'ear', 'outspoken', 'unpretentious', 'American', 'cute', 'children', 'mix', 'servants', 'are', 'charmed', 'very', 'predictable', 'outcome', 'well-played', 'heartwarming', 'Grandpa', 'Roger', 'Moore', 'even', 'softens', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'ultimately', 'decorate', 'are', 'ballet', 'lessons', 'archery', 'instructions', 'fox-hunt', ""n't"", 'really', 'fox-hunt', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'Ball', 'where', 'social', 'climbers', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'Do', ""n't"", 'over-analyze', 'believability', 'just', 'enjoy', 'good', 'clean', 'holiday-themed', 'story', 'emphasis', 'importance', 'family']",A Princess for Christmas

In 2011, this film was released in the U.K. and Canada, and was one I REALLY wanted to see; it was my one ""guilty pleasure"" buy. It looked so sweet and because it starred Katie McGrath from ""Merlin."" Turns out despite the fact that I shouldn't have bought it, it was well worth it.Christmas should be a time of joy and family traditions but this Christmas should especially be a happy one, and Jules Daly (McGrath) is determined to give that to her niece and nephew. Since her sister and brother-in-law died the year prior, Jules has been trying her best to make a new home for these kids who she now looks on as her own but... Milo (Travis Turner) is a teenager who doesn't want his aunt to assert a parental authority in any part of his life while young Maddie is a seven-year-old who probably won't even remember her parents as she grows up. Just after she loses her job, a proper English butler, by Paisley Winterbottom (Miles Richardson) shows up on Jules doorstep. He has come to the states as a representative of the Duke of Castlebury Hall (Roger Moore) in order to persuade Jules to bring her niece and nephew to England in order to visit their grandfather. Unhappy about the situation, Jules refuses because she cannot see subjecting the kids to a visit with the royal in-laws who refused the existence of their son following his choice to marry a commoner - Jule's sister. After thought, Jules has a change of heart, and off the trio goes to England to spend Christmas with dukes and duchesses - and even a prince in the form of Uncle Ashton (Sam Heughan).Confession time: I absolutely adored this movie. For practical reasons, I can't say it was because this is a sweeping epic based off a true story or because it has a beautiful spiritual bent, but because there is a fairy-tale quality that I couldn't help but love. To be honest, the movie starts out a bit rocky. In the opening frames, the director seemed to engage in a bit of awkward filming and the camera shots don't seem to do anything to compliment the actors, but once that passes - it is probably gone before fifteen minutes have passed, the viewers can settle in for an adorable, sweet little movie. The ""adventure"" of the whole movie is a lot of fun also. Jules wasn't sure that it was right to introduce Milo and Maddie to the grandfather who thought nothing of their mother, but eventually she realized that they might have the right to know their grandfather and it was that decision that led to a wonderful Christmas filled with joy - and maybe even the potential for a beautiful future.The acting in this one was actually nothing to scoff at - Katie held her own against veteran Roger Moore (part of the James Bond fame) although as an Irish actress, there were occasions where ever the slightest hint of her accent slipped into her American dialogue. Still, she was great, plus she and Sam were really cute together. If there are any real faults or clich&eacute;s, it is in the script which can sometimes take its talent for granted. Nevertheless this is a wonderful little family film - all warm and fuzzy as it finds just the right moods of festiveness, and yet, captures a real emphasis on family and its importance. Also known as 'Christmas at Castlebury Hall' (which is what it released under in Canada) and 'A Christmas Princess' (the U.K.), this film is available in Katie's home land and is slated to release here, in America in October 2012.Production crews found some really pretty sets (like the castle) and the camera often pans some gorgeous scenery. There is a pretty ball room scene and I was pleasantly surprised that the movie moved away from a few of the trivial expectations I had of it. If you like British productions or just happy-go-lucky romances, check into this one. I thought the ending was adorable and I liked how the characters interacted - including the servants with Jules and the kids. In that way, this movie actually reminded me (albeit very loosely) of Downton Abbey. This is definitely one of my most loved Christmas films from 2011 - I am so glad I was able to see it; A Princess for Christmas is just another charming `hallmark' of why this channel is oh-so-popular.

1576286,A4FX5YCJA630V,B008U1ANHG,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[4, 8]","Given the amount of five-star reviews for ""A Princess for Christmas"", I realize I'm risking an onslaught of negative votes by giving it only two, but the truth will out. Having been a long-time fan of the BBC'sMerlin, and knowing that Katie McGrath (aka Morgana) starred in this, I decide to check it out. Also released as ""Christmas at Castlebury"" and ""A Christmas Princess"", this is a typical Hallmark Christmas movie, which means the entire film can be described in a word: saccharine.sac*cha*rine (adjective)1 a: of, relating to, or resembling that of sugar &lt;saccharine taste> b: yielding or containing sugar &lt;saccharine vegetables>2: overly or sickishly sweet &lt;saccharine flavor>3: ingratiatingly or affectedly agreeable or friendly4: overly sentimental: mawkish &lt;a saccharine love story>Like many other young attractive single women who star in these types of movies, Jules Daly (Katie McGrath) has been burdened with her dead sister and brother-in-law's children. She's a cute, clumsy girl who trips over everything, breaks almost anything she touches, and can't even drive down her straight driveway without crashing into trashcans. D'aww. Like many other heart-warming orphans of their ilk, Milo and Maddy are precocious and adorable, but also a little troubled. Milo (Travis Turner - who was in his mid-twenties when this was filmed, believe it or not) is a delinquent because he steals an R-rated DVD from the rental store and then commits the crime of telling his little sister that there's no Santa, whilst Maddy (Leilah de Meza) gets up to some cutesy hi-jinks that result in the nanny quitting.So Jules is faced with no job, no nanny and two upset orphaned children - AT CHRISTMAS! Luckily for them, a contrived plot device is on the way. The children's grandfather Lord Huntingdon (Roger Moore) has decided that he wants to see the children of his estranged son before he dies (even though he doesn't seem hugely interested in them once they arrive) and his butler - you can tell what is his occupation is by the fact that he's given the name Paisley Winterbottom - arrives at Jules's house to issue the invitation. Seeing no better prospects, Jules agrees.So Jules, Milo and Maddy arrive in an unspecified European country where everyone has an obscure accent and yet behaves like a stereotypical stuffy English aristocrat. At the grand castle of Castlebury (which is a bit like calling a town Townsville) the children meet their grandfather, who tells them over dinner that their mother was an unworthy match for his son because she had no title. It's actually pretty funny at how casually he shares this fact, and how nonchalantly the kids take it.Also present is Lord Huntington's second son Ashton (Sam Heughan), who tells Jules that he's a prince on his (deceased) mother's side - which makes absolutely no sense if you think about it. Lord Huntington never actually verbalises: ""the wrong son died!"" but the implication is there, and he caps off the joyous family reunion by informing everyone that there will be no Christmas tree in his house.Naturally, free-spirited Jules and the wide-eyed kiddies win him over, and in about two seconds Gramps is helping them decorate a newly-bought Christmas tree. Since this occurs at the half-way mark of the film, the writers have to scramble for another conflict. And so after a lengthy dance montage to pad out the running-time, out trots Ashton's snotty love interest, an upper-class cow who wants to get her claws into the prince, and that indispensable tool of any romantic-comedy: the overheard conversation that is completely misunderstood by the eavesdropper.Mistakenly believing that Gramps and Ashton think she's crass and unworthy, Jules makes a dash for the airport, but is coaxed back by the staff, who have been won over by her American charm and all contributed to a new dress for her to wear to the ball. So she gets her requisite slow stair walk and dance with prince charming, only for snotty love interest to try and sabotage everything by revealing the shocking truth to the assembly: Jules is unemployed! Milo stole a DVD! Maddy eats too many crisps! How she knows any of this is a mystery, but it turns out that no one really cares, and so they live happily ever after with a cameo from Santa and a fairytale wedding. Yay!Okay, so it's easy to make fun of a movie that aspires to be nothing more than the filmic equivalent of candy-floss and toffee. So, I'll give it this: ""A Princess for Christmas"" is a totally harmless and inoffensive film, and Katie McGrath is effervescent. Bless her, I'm sure on some level she knew she was in a terrible TV movie, but damn it if she isn't going to try and sell every single trite line and corny scene she's given. It's a typical Cinderella story filmed in and around the beautiful Peles Castle in Romania, and it's perfectly safe for kids, with no violence, language or other questionable content. So you probably already know whether or not this is for you - a fluffy fairytale that makes very little sense and is packed full of clich&eacute;s, but is certainly very pretty to look at.",2,"""I

A few rough spots (not launage or anything like that) but over all was pleased.",4,enjoyable,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,585,"['Ok', 'love', 'Christmas', 'chic', 'flicks', 'story', 'book', 'endings', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'disappoint', 'first', 'two', 'reviews', 'gave', 'much', 'details', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'what', 'was', 'written', 'before', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'movie', 'sweet', 'ending', 'add', 'Christmas', 'collection', 'then', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'did', 'find', 'Sam', 'club', 'just', '10', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'should', 'buy', 'had', ""n't"", 'checked', 'out', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'first', 'took', 'chance', 'was', 'glad', 'did', 'A', 'few', 'rough', 'spots', 'not', 'launage', 'anything', 'was', 'pleased']",A Princess for Christmas
