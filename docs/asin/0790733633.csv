I was 13 at the time,but I really empathized with Jackson's Trevor Garfield-a very gifted and smart teacher.I did not really see this film as the gritty thriller that it was,but Jackson kept my focus all the way through.As 187 goes to show,it's a hard life for a teacher and (as one character put it,""teachers don't get no respect"").Also equally gripping was Clifton Gonzalez-Gonzalez as Thug Cesar(considered to be gonzalez's breakout role).Though the ending did catch me off guard,I must admit that every time I saw this movie on cable,I could not turn it off. I recently viewed the DVD with the commentary track on,and I thank the director for at least putting commentary on the DVD,as opposed to just the trailer.Even though it came to DVD 3 years after the theatrical release.Long story short, 187 deserved way more credit than it got,and this was another signature powerful performance from Jackson that was vastly overlooked.P.S.-the soundtrack is worth listening to,as every song in the film(with the exception of Miles Davis' ""Blue in Green"")is on the album.",3,187-gripping and volatile atmospheric school thriller,1307232000,"06 5, 2011",2011,1215,"['film', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'weekend', 'Spawn', 'begged', 'dad', 'check', 'out', 'so', 'course', 'being', 'huge', 'sam', 'jackson', 'fan', 'went', 'go', 'see', '187', 'was', '13', 'time', 'really', 'empathized', 'Jackson', 'Trevor', 'Garfield-a', 'very', 'gifted', 'smart', 'teacher.I', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'see', 'film', 'gritty', 'thriller', 'was', 'Jackson', 'kept', 'focus', 'way', '187', 'show', 'hard', 'life', 'teacher', 'one', 'character', 'put', 'teachers', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'respect', '.Also', 'equally', 'gripping', 'was', 'Clifton', 'Gonzalez-Gonzalez', 'Thug', 'Cesar', 'considered', 'be', 'gonzalez', 'role', 'ending', 'did', 'catch', 'off', 'guard', 'must', 'admit', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'cable', 'could', 'not', 'turn', 'off', 'recently', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'track', 'thank', 'director', 'least', 'putting', 'commentary', 'DVD', 'opposed', 'just', 'trailer.Even', 'came', 'DVD', '3', 'years', 'theatrical', 'release.Long', 'story', 'short', '187', 'deserved', 'way', 'more', 'credit', 'got', 'was', 'signature', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Jackson', 'was', 'vastly', 'overlooked.P.S.-the', 'soundtrack', 'worth', 'listening', 'song', 'film', 'exception', 'Miles', 'Davis', 'Blue', 'Green', 'album']",N/A

Jackson has always been one of my favor actors when it comes to suspense films, however this is a suspense that's more psychological than it is straight up ""kick butt and take names later"" type of toughness that you might associate with Samuel L. Jackson's characters.  After a student unexpectedly stabs a teacher (played by Samuel L. Jackson) from behind, he recovers and returns to his teacher role in another school 15 months later.  However while the physical scars have remained, later on we find out that mental scars have remained too.When Samuel finds out that one of his students is a gang member after the student refuses to behave in class, tension soon develops and eventually intensifies as the student and Samuel get more and more aggravated with each other.  Turns out this gang member has a secret compassionless murderous side to him, and it's up to Samuel to change him into a better person.  But... well, let's just say the two don't exactly shake hands and make up at the end of the film.  The ending is REALLY shocking.  I didn't see it ending *that* way!Other characters in the movie is a blonde-haired extremely timid and shy teacher that is *really* out of place compared to the chaos and disrespectful students that surround her which isn't the least bit believable (but interesting nonetheless because she hits off a relationship with Samuel L. Jackson), and an attractive Spanish female student that wants out of this bad school so desperately that she's willing to do absolutely anything to get out, even assume that Samuel will use her for sex (which results in a brief moment of nudity later on, and the reason for the girls actions is explained later on).This is entirely a drama by the way- no comedy anywhere in sight.  Not that you'd expect comedy unless Samuel L. Jackson has starred in comedy films in the past and I'm unaware of them.  I can't imagine anyone else but Samuel playing this role, and play it well he does.  He comes across as honest and willing lend help whenever needed for the sake of being a commendable teacher who, as fate would have it, happens to find teacher positions in the toughest schools in town.What makes this film so good other than the strong writing, memorable characters and solid pacing, is that there's no telling how the story is going to finish.  You're left to figure that one out on your own.  Let's just say, it's basically Samuel L. Jackson against an entire gang.  The gang is worse than they appear (and are all terrific actors too by the way).

101543,AK2AQIULQDFS5,0790733633,Bradley Tobin,"[1, 11]","Like the films ""Schindler's List"" and ""Sleepers"", ""187"" is a film that is trying to tell a Story, a story that is Hard to Stomach. In telling that story, it Fails to make it Cinematic in Any way, and it will leave its audience Depressed, Alienated and Angry. If This was it's Goal, it Succeeded, but this Should Not have been its goal.I won't go into details about the plotline; I'll just say it is Grim. Films featuring Far Grimmer Storylines Have been made, but they are given Something to lighten it all up. True Stories don't have that Luxury. ""Schindler's List"", for example, doesn't have a Comic Relief Character; it doesn't Warp the truth to please audiences. It tells the Awful Truth but remains a Cinematic Masterpiece. I'm not sure whether or not ""187"" is a true story or not, but it is not a very Interesting one, and Certainly not one I'd be Eager to put myself through again.Samuel L Jackson's Powerhouse performance becomes the films Main Saving Grace. The Other graces include a Strong Supporting Cast (Particularly Clifton Collins Jr as Cesar) and Daring Photography that will Stick with you Much more than the Story will.

I have been lucky enough to see all different types of schools: rural, suburban, and  urban.  My three years in a Bronx high school were some of the most  challenging, frustrating, rewarding, scary, funny, heartwarming, and  gutwrenching of my life.  Inner-city teaching is truly one of the toughest  jobs in the world.There have been many movies about inner-city teachers:  Dangerous Minds, The Substitute, Teachers, The Principal just to name a  few.  While none of those movies are terrible and some were fun to watch,  none of them really showed what it is like to be a teacher.  187 is the  only teaching movie I have seen that captures the emotions a teacher goes  through teaching in that environment.Now parts of 187 get carried away.  I won't deny that.  But the basic theme of what can happen if a teacher  takes a situation to the level of the students is universal.  No teacher is  going to hunt down his/her students like in the film but again the basic  idea of how to handle a threat or violence in a school is universal.I  also like how the film discussed how Samuel Jackson's character is trying  to regain his desire to teach and playing that off the young idealistic  teacher and the burned out teacher.  These are real characters and I felt  the comparisson and outcomes was extremely credible.Bottom line is this,  I do not think non-teachers will love this movie they might like it.  But  this is a teachers movie.

101549,A2GYX971VETQBV,0790733633,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[8, 13]","""187"" does not provide the viewer with a realistic insight into America's schools.  Science teachers do not stalk students and then drop them with morphine injections, launched from a bow.  But I did not pick up ""187"" expecting the classic teacher-makes-a-difference-in-children's-lives film.  The very title moves one away from this depiction.  Instead, ""187"" provides an interesting look into the job of educators when they are dealing firsthand with the violence that exists in many of America's communities.One thing that I would have liked from this film is a slower transition from Samuel L. Jackson's former self to his newer self.  The audience believes that they know his character and (quite suddenly) he has snapped and we are a bit unsure of the movement.  This film is an intense experience-I found my nerves quite strained at the prospects of the chaos that exists in these communities.  Above all, this film neither glorifies the student's actions nor the teacher's retaliation-a fact that prevents it from becoming a simple bloodbath movie.  One leaves this film with a sense of loss on both sides and the utterly hopeless situation that we have created in our school systems.  Jackson's character does, despite what some may say, have an impact on the students he teaches.  But his victory is not without devastating losses; a Pyrrhic victory, as the movie (not so subtly) alludes.Word to the wise: this is not an uplifting film.  Do not rent it thinking you're in for a ""To Sir, With Love"" experience.  Just read the title.

Years ago there was the threat of corporal punishment, if not the actual fear of parent retaliation.  Now, however, children are spoiled, often without strong male-role models (particularly in the more urban areas), there is simply no respect for authority or desire to contribute meaningfully to society, all parents think their child is a perfect little snowflake, and the outlook for a teacher in a troubled area is particularly bleak and hopeless.Trevor Garfield (Samuel L. Jackson) is a high school teacher who has recently been reassigned as a substitute in a rough, dilapidated LA school district after suffering a shank attack at the hands of one of his former students.  Realizing the corrupt, bereaucratic school administration will never help him when the misbehavior and student intimidation begins anew, Garfield is handcuffed by not only rules, but also fear, and the depressing reality that his values and morals are not shared by many of his students, particularly the local gang leaders Benny (Lobo Sebastian) and Cesar (Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez).  In no time at all, Garfield - who is immediately immersed in the gang culture when students begin to call him Mr. G, where G is for Gangster - breaks down psychologically and flips from gentle, timid, caring teacher to possessed madman intent on retaliation.Samuel L. Jackson turns in a powerhouse performance in this movie, showing ghetto schools from a teacher's perspective.  The attitude flip is classic Samuel L. Jackson, just as quick as Michael Douglas in Falling Down, but a bit more angry, and the retaliation used on the punk thugs throughout the movie, while over the top, is ingenious.A teacher until the end, Mr. G proves that Cesar's way of life is meaningless, and instructs that he's willing to quite literally risk everything, to die, if it will provide one last lesson, one last Pyrrhic victory.",5,R U DUN?,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,1941,"['Many', 'teachers', 'today', 'school', 'systems', 'must', 'feel', 'helpless', 'Years', 'was', 'threat', 'corporal', 'punishment', 'not', 'actual', 'fear', 'parent', 'retaliation', 'Now', 'however', 'children', 'are', 'spoiled', 'often', 'strong', 'male-role', 'models', 'particularly', 'more', 'urban', 'areas', 'simply', 'respect', 'authority', 'desire', 'contribute', 'meaningfully', 'society', 'parents', 'think', 'child', 'perfect', 'little', 'snowflake', 'outlook', 'teacher', 'troubled', 'area', 'particularly', 'bleak', 'hopeless.Trevor', 'Garfield', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'who', 'recently', 'been', 'reassigned', 'substitute', 'rough', 'dilapidated', 'LA', 'school', 'district', 'suffering', 'shank', 'attack', 'hands', 'one', 'former', 'students', 'Realizing', 'corrupt', 'bereaucratic', 'school', 'administration', 'will', 'never', 'help', 'when', 'misbehavior', 'student', 'intimidation', 'anew', 'Garfield', 'handcuffed', 'not', 'only', 'rules', 'also', 'fear', 'depressing', 'reality', 'values', 'morals', 'are', 'not', 'shared', 'many', 'students', 'particularly', 'local', 'gang', 'leaders', 'Benny', 'Lobo', 'Sebastian', 'Cesar', 'Clifton', 'Gonzalez', 'Gonzalez', 'time', 'Garfield', 'who', 'immediately', 'immersed', 'gang', 'culture', 'when', 'students', 'begin', 'call', 'Mr.', 'G', 'where', 'G', 'Gangster', 'breaks', 'down', 'psychologically', 'flips', 'gentle', 'timid', 'caring', 'teacher', 'possessed', 'madman', 'intent', 'retaliation.Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'movie', 'showing', 'ghetto', 'schools', 'teacher', 'perspective', 'attitude', 'flip', 'classic', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'just', 'as', 'quick', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'Falling', 'Down', 'bit', 'more', 'angry', 'retaliation', 'used', 'punk', 'thugs', 'movie', 'top', 'ingenious.A', 'teacher', 'end', 'Mr.', 'G', 'Cesar', 'way', 'life', 'meaningless', 'willing', 'quite', 'literally', 'risk', 'everything', 'die', 'will', 'provide', 'one', 'last', 'lesson', 'one', 'last', 'Pyrrhic', 'victory']",N/A

I think the director took a lot of creative license and pushed things to a bit of an extreme with Garfield and Cesar's characters, but it only served to improve the quality of the film.This is less &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; or &quot;The Substitute&quot; than it is &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;.  Samuel L. Jackson does a superb job with his character Trevor Garfield, a man of deep moral convinctions and idealism who crumbles psychologically throughout the film.  The way it is shot, along with the ominous soundtrack, creates an atmosphere of palpable doom and chaos.  Garfield's speech to a fellow teacher who is beginning to realize the odd connection between the disappearance of troublesome students and his relation to them is really disturbing.  The director should have worked more on the &quot;teacher snapping&quot; bit and had it a little less covert, but overall I would say this movie falls into cult classic, if not classic, range.  The darkness is unforgettable, and the film does raise some relevant issues as to how people with values interact with those who have none.  There is a certain flavor to this movie, somewhat inarticulate, that for me makes it worthy of the most lavish praise.  This is no uplifting, Sidney Poitier film of redemption.

101562,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,0790733633,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[4, 4]","A former principal once said (in utter irony) that teachers would like to ""teach the best and shoot the rest,"" but that was not going to happen (teaching only the best and shooting the rest). Basically, that idea is the premise of ""187,"" a term referring to the on-air police code for ""dead.""Early in the movie, when Samuel L. Jackson's character Trevor Garfield is stabbed repeatedly in the back after warning his principal that this very act was going to happen, the viewer viscerally understands a teacher's stultifying fear in an urban school when there is no support. Garfield does not die physically, but something inside him does. Not his will power, it thrives. Not his machismo, it heightens. Not his desire to teach, but a piece of it breaks off to become dark and malignant. Not his compassion, but it forks into something normal and something twisted. A vicious act, not just on Garfield's person, but also on his choice of how to value and direct his life, chips away some of his humanity.After a more than year-long recovery Garfield traverses a continent away from New York to settle in California and begin substitute teaching. His assignment? Where else but in a ""temporary"" building subject to gang-banger violence and mayhem. On his first day he is dealt a threat by an police-ankle-bracelet-wearing gang-banger.  Of course, there is the requisite confrontation between the two, setting up inevitable violence. Deja vu!Then there's the stereotypical teen girl with a heart of gold who hands out her ""favors"" as if she is passing out candy. Garfield determines to look after and encourage her as a person of worth. Two other stereotypes flank Garfield: the innocent young teacher (Kelly Rowan)  with idealism in her eyes and heart and the jaundiced, veteran teacher (John Heard)  who's in it ""for the paycheck."" Garfield stands in between: realistic in experience, idealistic in hope.Yet gang-bangers just won't let him be. Remember that dark and growing malignancy in his heart? What will he do with it? Does he become a victim of his environment like Gonzalez or does he overcome it?This film shows evil committed by evil people. Or is that the point? Is this about one good teacher opposed by a bunch of lowlife gang-bangers set on destruction, violence, ruination, rape? The film subtly suggests that evil is not committed by choice but caused by the traps of society at large and urban decay in particular. It's a short moment, but a veritable revelation when Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez's gang-banger character excretes his defense for his violent acts. Gonzalez duly impresses with his excellent portrayal of a young man doomed not by his environment, but by his own inability to defy the prison that is his environment.Although the story is set in California, the land of the strange allows students such ridiculous freedoms as wearing ""wife-beater"" undershirts, chains as belts, open smoking on campus, including that illegal reefer, unsupervised areas where true ""gang-banging"" takes place with this young girl with no self-esteem, and sets up an environment of too much freedom,  which allows, even encourages disrespect. The school in New York was no different.This dark film, ""187,"" is not for the weak of heart. It makes crystal clear just how much  violence can impact a person in a given situation. How does a dedicated teacher escape attacks by equally dedicated gang-bangers? Is there a way to halt escalating violence once it begins? Is there a solution? This film proffers one view, that of Director Kevin Reynolds and Writer Scott Yagemann. The end credit attributes the script to a teacher.Despite the stereotyping of all the major characters, the movie works, mainly because of the consummate acting all around and credibility. Can such a story happen? I think so. Can men come to such a momentous act? Absolutely. Can they back down, given the circumstances? Yes, but not likely, not with all the existing factors in play.""187""--powerful, provocative, profound, deadly.",4,The ugly side,1284422400,"09 14, 2010",2010,4009,"['former', 'principal', 'once', 'said', 'utter', 'irony', 'teachers', 'would', 'like', 'teach', 'best', 'shoot', 'rest', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'teaching', 'only', 'best', 'shooting', 'rest', 'Basically', 'idea', 'premise', '187', 'term', 'referring', 'on-air', 'police', 'code', 'dead', 'Early', 'movie', 'when', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'character', 'Trevor', 'Garfield', 'stabbed', 'repeatedly', 'back', 'warning', 'principal', 'very', 'act', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'viewer', 'viscerally', 'teacher', 'stultifying', 'fear', 'urban', 'school', 'when', 'support', 'Garfield', 'not', 'die', 'physically', 'something', 'inside', 'Not', 'will', 'power', 'Not', 'machismo', 'Not', 'desire', 'teach', 'piece', 'become', 'dark', 'malignant', 'Not', 'compassion', 'something', 'normal', 'something', 'twisted', 'vicious', 'act', 'not', 'just', 'Garfield', 'person', 'also', 'choice', 'how', 'value', 'direct', 'life', 'chips', 'away', 'humanity.After', 'more', 'year-long', 'recovery', 'Garfield', 'continent', 'away', 'New', 'York', 'settle', 'California', 'begin', 'substitute', 'teaching', 'assignment', 'Where', 'else', 'temporary', 'building', 'subject', 'gang-banger', 'violence', 'mayhem', 'first', 'day', 'dealt', 'threat', 'police-ankle-bracelet-wearing', 'gang-banger', 'course', 'requisite', 'confrontation', 'two', 'setting', 'up', 'inevitable', 'violence', 'Deja', 'vu', 'Then', 'stereotypical', 'teen', 'girl', 'heart', 'gold', 'who', 'out', 'favors', 'passing', 'out', 'candy', 'Garfield', 'look', 'encourage', 'person', 'worth', 'Two', 'other', 'stereotypes', 'flank', 'Garfield', 'innocent', 'young', 'teacher', 'Kelly', 'Rowan', 'idealism', 'eyes', 'heart', 'jaundiced', 'veteran', 'teacher', 'John', 'Heard', 'who', 'paycheck', 'Garfield', 'realistic', 'experience', 'idealistic', 'hope.Yet', 'gang-bangers', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'be', 'Remember', 'dark', 'growing', 'malignancy', 'heart', 'What', 'will', 'do', 'become', 'victim', 'environment', 'Gonzalez', 'overcome', 'film', 'evil', 'committed', 'evil', 'people', 'point', 'one', 'good', 'teacher', 'opposed', 'bunch', 'lowlife', 'gang-bangers', 'set', 'destruction', 'violence', 'ruination', 'rape', 'film', 'subtly', 'evil', 'not', 'committed', 'choice', 'caused', 'traps', 'society', 'large', 'urban', 'decay', 'particular', 'short', 'moment', 'veritable', 'revelation', 'when', 'Clifton', 'Gonzalez', 'Gonzalez', 'gang-banger', 'character', 'defense', 'violent', 'acts', 'Gonzalez', 'duly', 'impresses', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'young', 'man', 'doomed', 'not', 'environment', 'own', 'inability', 'defy', 'prison', 'story', 'set', 'California', 'land', 'strange', 'students', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'freedoms', 'wearing', 'wife-beater', 'undershirts', 'chains', 'belts', 'open', 'smoking', 'campus', 'including', 'illegal', 'reefer', 'unsupervised', 'areas', 'where', 'true', 'gang-banging', 'place', 'young', 'girl', 'self-esteem', 'up', 'environment', 'too', 'much', 'freedom', 'even', 'disrespect', 'school', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'different.This', 'dark', 'film', '187', 'not', 'weak', 'heart', 'crystal', 'clear', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'violence', 'can', 'impact', 'person', 'given', 'situation', 'How', 'dedicated', 'teacher', 'escape', 'attacks', 'equally', 'dedicated', 'gang-bangers', 'way', 'halt', 'escalating', 'violence', 'there', 'solution', 'film', 'one', 'view', 'Director', 'Kevin', 'Reynolds', 'Writer', 'Scott', 'Yagemann', 'end', 'credit', 'script', 'teacher.Despite', 'stereotyping', 'major', 'characters', 'movie', 'mainly', 'consummate', 'acting', 'credibility', 'Can', 'such', 'story', 'happen', 'think', 'so', 'Can', 'men', 'come', 'momentous', 'act', 'Absolutely', 'Can', 'back', 'down', 'given', 'circumstances', 'Yes', 'not', 'likely', 'not', 'existing', 'factors', 'play', '187', 'powerful', 'provocative', 'profound', 'deadly']",N/A

101577,AXV9GS0TMSVW,0790733633,Poor Napoleon,"[3, 4]","187 is a strange movie about schools.  It's strange because this is one of the few pictures that looks at a teacher's perspective of the system and it's strange because it's not a rosy picture of schools.  Jackson's portrayal of Trevor Garfield paints a picture of a nervous, worried teacher who was passionate about teaching, but is now scared of the slightest sound, continually checking the corner of his eye, as he's been faced with a near fatal attack a year earlier.What the film is about is the various teachers' reactions to the students around them.  Garfield wants to do good, but has a past that is burning him up inside.  John Heard's character is a teacher who's embittered by the students, working to merely cash a paycheck, while kelly rowan's character means well, but is scared and confides in Jackson's character because he is a survivor.What I love about the film is that there is a realism in the way the teachers communicate with each other.  The good and the bad is here.  We get a picture of the various attitudes teachers have about their kids and how some events can make or break a teacher.  I also love how 187 explores the political and sometimes beuaracratic nature of the classrooms, including the placement of students in a given classroom, and how teachers can sometimes have their jobs put in jeopardy because of very rigid law.  Clearly, the writer Scott Yagemann, who is a teacher himself, feels the system has failed and has gotten in the way of a primary goal of teachers when they enter the profession: a desire to teach.The film is somewhat problematic with an over the top, preachy, and somewhat implausible conclusion.  But the writer wears his heart on his sleeve and the above all message about the passion being sucked out of teaching is clear.  For that reason, it's as powerful a movie as any about teaching even if it lacks the uplifting conclusion so many others offer.",4,"A little heavy handed, but still really interesting portrait of problems in schools",1156982400,"08 31, 2006",2006,1917,"['187', 'strange', 'movie', 'schools', 'strange', 'one', 'few', 'pictures', 'teacher', 'perspective', 'system', 'strange', 'not', 'rosy', 'picture', 'schools', 'Jackson', 'portrayal', 'Trevor', 'Garfield', 'picture', 'nervous', 'worried', 'teacher', 'who', 'was', 'passionate', 'teaching', 'now', 'scared', 'slightest', 'sound', 'continually', 'checking', 'corner', 'eye', 'been', 'faced', 'near', 'fatal', 'attack', 'year', 'film', 'about', 'various', 'teachers', 'reactions', 'students', 'Garfield', 'do', 'good', 'past', 'burning', 'up', 'inside', 'John', 'Heard', 'character', 'teacher', 'who', 'embittered', 'students', 'working', 'merely', 'cash', 'paycheck', 'kelly', 'rowan', 'character', 'well', 'scared', 'confides', 'Jackson', 'character', 'survivor.What', 'love', 'film', 'realism', 'way', 'teachers', 'communicate', 'other', 'good', 'bad', 'here', 'get', 'picture', 'various', 'attitudes', 'teachers', 'have', 'kids', 'how', 'events', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'teacher', 'also', 'love', 'how', '187', 'political', 'sometimes', 'beuaracratic', 'nature', 'classrooms', 'including', 'placement', 'students', 'given', 'classroom', 'how', 'teachers', 'can', 'sometimes', 'have', 'jobs', 'put', 'jeopardy', 'very', 'rigid', 'law', 'Clearly', 'writer', 'Scott', 'Yagemann', 'who', 'teacher', 'system', 'failed', 'gotten', 'way', 'primary', 'goal', 'teachers', 'when', 'enter', 'profession', 'desire', 'teach.The', 'film', 'somewhat', 'problematic', 'top', 'preachy', 'somewhat', 'implausible', 'conclusion', 'writer', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'message', 'passion', 'being', 'sucked', 'teaching', 'clear', 'reason', 'as', 'powerful', 'movie', 'teaching', 'even', 'uplifting', 'conclusion', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'offer']",N/A

The film is neither pleasant nor uplifting; it is about the reality of public education.  There have been innumerable films about the subject before and since, but none of them has been truly honest about the plight in public schools - especially the urban ones.  Other films about the subject have given in to the need to gild the subject; a patient teacher turns his initially rough charges into a loyal, enthusiastic team.  Thousands of America's teachers - especially the substitutes - know the violently bitter reality.Samuel L. Jackson plays a talented New York teacher who - after being nearly fatally stabbed by a student - moves to L.A. to become a substitute.  There, he and his colleagues are besieged by violent Chicano gang members, leading up to barbarity, retribution, and hopelessness.  In a possibly intentional homage to the ending of ""High Noon,"" in which the sheriff tosses away his badge in disgust, the end of ""187"" features a young teacher tossing away her teaching certificate.  Indeed, most certificated teachers quit the profession within the first five years of service.This film captures many of the problems in public schools adroitly.  It is especially truthful about the administrators' fear of legal challenges, leading to abandonment of their responsibility to support teachers in their attempts to establish order and discipline in their classrooms.The film was poorly received when released.  I suspect because it points fingers where deserved.  Obviously, administrators didn't like it, nor did parents of ""at-risk"" students.  American society looks bad, because we, the people, have allowed our public schools to become training-penitentiaries.
