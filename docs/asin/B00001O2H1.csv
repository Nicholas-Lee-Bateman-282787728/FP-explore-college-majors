Yah, he had more than his share of celluloid bombs, but this isn't one of them. It reminds me of a Coen brothers film. And Brando's performance is hilarious and you can see him having fun with the character he plays. He looks like an overweight Captain Kangaroo. The other actors { Sheen , Sorvino, and Sutherland}  are O.K. in their roles. It's Brando that you can't take your eyes off of. He only made one more film after this &#34; The Score&#34; and that was more of a cameo. This was his last starring role in a movie and it is worth watching.",4,Not Bad Brando,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,674,"['was', 'reading', 'biography', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'movie', 'was', 'portrayed', 'author', 'huge', 'embarrassment', 'actor', 'Yah', 'had', 'more', 'share', 'celluloid', 'bombs', ""n't"", 'one', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'film', 'Brando', 'performance', 'hilarious', 'can', 'see', 'having', 'fun', 'character', 'overweight', 'Captain', 'Kangaroo', 'other', 'actors', 'Sheen', 'Sorvino', 'Sutherland', 'are', 'O.K', 'roles', 'Brando', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'only', 'made', 'one', 'more', 'film', '34', 'Score', '34', 'was', 'more', 'cameo', 'was', 'last', 'starring', 'role', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

I hadn't seen ""Streetcar Named Desire"" with the suddenly silly ""Stanley"" lines. The twins were likeably stupid and shallow, and PERFECT for the equally 'stupid' husbands they trapped.

I'm a fan of offbeat comedies like Stay Tuned, FRAUDS, Austin Powers and George of the Jungle, so this fits in my collection perfectly.Thomas Haden Church really stands out as the dumb, loveable, cuddly Larry Lumstrum. He has an unusual shock of yellowish white hair, odd for him, he has golden blonde hair!Larry might remind viewers of Lowell Mather from Wings. To tell you the truth, Larry IS Lowell Mather with white hair.My favorite scene has to be when Larry is stuck in the black Dodge truck as the train is zooming for the vehicle.

This movie has NOTHING to offer.  I watched it because I am (was?) a big fan of Brando (the actor).  He's clunked before (ever see ""Desiree""?) but at least his scripts all had possibilities.  Did he read this script before signing on?  There was nothing there!  This is worse than a bad Three Stooges movie.  Come to think of it, I owe the Three Stooges an appology.  There was talent in the movie but in name only; all the actors were way under par.  There was nothing creative or intepretive in Brando who looks like he's 400 lbs.  He looked that way in ""Don Juan Demarco"" and carried it off with a pretty good performance.  He just looks fat and ... well, I'll try and keep to a higher plane.  The humor was on the 6th grade level.  I watched through to the end as a public service.  There is no scene in the movie that warrents watching it.
