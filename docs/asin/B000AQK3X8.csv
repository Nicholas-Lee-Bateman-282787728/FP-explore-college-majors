931168,A34PAZQ73SL163,B000AQK3X8,"Bernard Chapin ""Ora Et Labora!""","[6, 7]","This is a teaching DVD as opposed to a live action one; a contrived simulation of a final table in which Gordon addresses viewers as he plays. The exercise certainly helps one understand how to play at the final table of a No Limit Hold `Em tournament. Of course, it expounds on a good deal more than that. Phil goes through many of the poker rules and concepts here which are also found in his Little Green Book, but the video does a fine job illustrating his points independently. He doesn't show you the hole cards of the other players which is helpful because it forces viewers to think along with him, and go through the decision making of a professional.Overall, this DVD is sound and you'll certainly get more out of it than what's in a random WPT video. Some of the lessons like, ""don't play dominated hands,"" are well-developed. It's a good teaching tool and it's always nice to see Chris Ferguson on television in any capacity-even if he's essentially acting. The Butch, ""internet punk,"" character is overdone but amusing. The only annoying thing here are the commercial breaks for Full Tilt Poker. Personally, I think it's dirty pool to subject us to those after we paid in advance for a product; although, I admit the one with Howard Lederer was witty.",4,Educational and Interesting.,1144713600,"04 11, 2006",2006,1264,"['teaching', 'DVD', 'opposed', 'live', 'action', 'one', 'contrived', 'simulation', 'final', 'table', 'Gordon', 'viewers', 'exercise', 'certainly', 'one', 'understand', 'how', 'play', 'final', 'table', 'No', 'Limit', 'Hold', 'Em', 'tournament', 'course', 'good', 'deal', 'more', 'Phil', 'many', 'poker', 'rules', 'concepts', 'here', 'are', 'also', 'found', 'Little', 'Green', 'Book', 'video', 'fine', 'job', 'illustrating', 'points', 'independently', ""n't"", 'show', 'hole', 'cards', 'other', 'players', 'helpful', 'viewers', 'think', 'go', 'decision', 'making', 'professional.Overall', 'DVD', 'sound', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'get', 'more', 'what', 'random', 'WPT', 'video', 'lessons', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'dominated', 'hands', 'are', 'well-developed', 'good', 'teaching', 'tool', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'Chris', 'Ferguson', 'television', 'capacity-even', 'essentially', 'acting', 'Butch', 'internet', 'punk', 'character', 'overdone', 'amusing', 'only', 'annoying', 'thing', 'here', 'are', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'Full', 'Tilt', 'Poker', 'Personally', 'think', 'dirty', 'pool', 'subject', 'paid', 'advance', 'product', 'admit', 'one', 'Howard', 'Lederer', 'was', 'witty']",N/A
931169,A2XGFPVV6P815H,B000AQK3X8,J. Rubino,"[23, 25]","Mostly, I liked it. It is above average in both content and production quality. It is geared toward the intermediateplayer with some tips for the advanced player, and the best short-cut on figuring pot odds I have seen.Note- it is not a real tournament- but as far as an instructional video I'm okay with that but you should be aware of that before you buy it. It is a scripted final table with six players-three actors, boxing announcer Michael Buffer's brother Bruce Buffer, Chris Ferguson and Phil Gordon. They used inexpensive generic quality non denominated chips which sound cheap every time they are thrown into the pots. It's a little bit ""Hollywood""( I knew exactly when the ""young gun"" was going to be eliminated on the flop of the hand he went broke on) but again it's an instructional video.What irritated me: the ""young gun"" player is wearing a hat with the logo ""Let's Get Ready to Rumble"" (the catch phrase made famous by Michael Buffer in championship boxing), the background is literally inundated with ""Expert Insight"" posters and large screen monitors with that logo( the company that produced the DVD), and they insert the ""Full Tilt"" television commercials into the tournament broadcast four times. So essentially it is a commercial for Expert Insight and Full Tilt Poker disguised as a poker tournament video. I still gave it four stars because the tutorial value for beginner to intermediate players is above average. I personally buy and watch DVD's so I won't have to watch commercials but that is really just a personal issue. Overall good quality.",4,lets get ready to...grumble,1132963200,"11 26, 2005",2005,1574,"['Mostly', 'liked', 'above', 'average', 'content', 'production', 'quality', 'geared', 'intermediateplayer', 'tips', 'advanced', 'player', 'best', 'short-cut', 'figuring', 'pot', 'odds', 'have', 'seen.Note-', 'not', 'real', 'tournament-', 'as', 'far', 'instructional', 'video', ""'m"", 'okay', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'buy', 'scripted', 'final', 'table', 'six', 'players-three', 'actors', 'boxing', 'announcer', 'Michael', 'Buffer', 'brother', 'Bruce', 'Buffer', 'Chris', 'Ferguson', 'Phil', 'Gordon', 'used', 'inexpensive', 'generic', 'quality', 'non', 'denominated', 'chips', 'sound', 'cheap', 'time', 'are', 'thrown', 'pots', 'little', 'bit', 'Hollywood', 'knew', 'exactly', 'when', 'young', 'gun', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'eliminated', 'flop', 'hand', 'went', 'broke', 'again', 'instructional', 'video.What', 'irritated', 'young', 'gun', 'player', 'wearing', 'hat', 'logo', 'Let', 'Get', 'Ready', 'Rumble', 'catch', 'phrase', 'made', 'famous', 'Michael', 'Buffer', 'championship', 'boxing', 'background', 'literally', 'inundated', 'Expert', 'Insight', 'posters', 'large', 'screen', 'monitors', 'logo', 'company', 'produced', 'DVD', 'insert', 'Full', 'Tilt', 'television', 'commercials', 'tournament', 'broadcast', 'four', 'times', 'So', 'essentially', 'commercial', 'Expert', 'Insight', 'Full', 'Tilt', 'Poker', 'disguised', 'poker', 'tournament', 'video', 'still', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'tutorial', 'value', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'players', 'above', 'average', 'personally', 'buy', 'watch', 'DVD', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'commercials', 'really', 'just', 'personal', 'issue', 'Overall', 'good', 'quality']",N/A
931170,A3PHF6OJ6QFZ4B,B000AQK3X8,Mathew Benjamin Scheeren,"[1, 1]","This is a really great DvD.  Getting inside the mind of Phil Gordon really offers you a lot of insights on just what goes through a Pro's head as they're making their step-by-step decisions.  Plus I loved the visuals that he gives when explaining Pot Odds, Implied Odds, the Rule of 4 & 2 (From his book), and the like.  The visuals alone helped me understand some finer points that I had yet to pick up until I watched this.He really does go into great detail when explaining his actions and inactions, & it's a delight to see Chris Ferguson participating in this video as well.The DvD is centered around a mock tournament, ala the World Poker Tour, along with the cool guitar music and amusing commentary (although Mike Sexton and Van Patten are more interesting).  And I must say it's done Very, Very Well.  Absolutely entertaining and educating throughout.I loved the comedy thrown in at different points, along with the funniest poker commercial I've ever seen :-D  If you've seen this, it's the one with the guy who gets up and dances ala Michael Jackson after spiking his card on the river, absolutely HILARIOUS!Overall: ***** 5 Stars!!!

931171,A2FSEGZDAONS2U,B000AQK3X8,Movie Madman,"[4, 6]","What every DVD tried to accomplish, Gordon has done it right here. The production value is high and could rival most any televised poker you have seen. This scripted final table is very informative and highly entertaining. Without giving anything away, I felt the information provided and the situations Phil had to deal with in the tournament are not unlike situations most of us have found outselves in a lot of times. Listening to his thinking process is a very clever way to convey information to the viewer in a different way than any other DVD.The company who made this DVD did not spare any expense. I hate that this information will go out to people I will be playing, but I do hope a lot of people buy it so it encourages them to make more just like this. The DVD has a beginner's and advanced player track that is played during the tournament. I watched it in both versions back to back. The tournament is entertaining enough to watch it dozens of times.You can feel at ease in getting this DVD knowing you will not be disappointed. It is one of the more expensive DVDs out there, but it is definitely worth every penny. If you have Gordon's Little Green Book, you will see a lot of the ideas he writes about are shown on the DVD. If you're serious about tournament poker, I think this is a necessary DVD to have.",5,Phil Gordon Has Done It,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,1323,"['What', 'DVD', 'tried', 'accomplish', 'Gordon', 'done', 'right', 'here', 'production', 'value', 'high', 'could', 'rival', 'most', 'televised', 'poker', 'have', 'seen', 'scripted', 'final', 'table', 'very', 'informative', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'felt', 'information', 'provided', 'situations', 'Phil', 'had', 'deal', 'tournament', 'are', 'not', 'situations', 'most', 'have', 'found', 'outselves', 'lot', 'times', 'Listening', 'thinking', 'process', 'very', 'clever', 'way', 'convey', 'information', 'viewer', 'different', 'way', 'other', 'DVD.The', 'company', 'who', 'made', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'spare', 'expense', 'hate', 'information', 'will', 'go', 'out', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'playing', 'do', 'hope', 'lot', 'people', 'buy', 'make', 'more', 'just', 'DVD', 'beginner', 'advanced', 'player', 'track', 'played', 'tournament', 'watched', 'versions', 'back', 'back', 'tournament', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'watch', 'times.You', 'can', 'feel', 'ease', 'getting', 'DVD', 'knowing', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'one', 'more', 'expensive', 'DVDs', 'there', 'definitely', 'worth', 'penny', 'have', 'Gordon', 'Little', 'Green', 'Book', 'will', 'see', 'lot', 'ideas', 'are', 'shown', 'DVD', ""'re"", 'serious', 'tournament', 'poker', 'think', 'necessary', 'DVD', 'have']",N/A
931172,AE4G85QH81AVP,B000AQK3X8,VFT,"[11, 11]","This is a great DVD for beginners and intermediate players. This will help you tighten up your tournament and final table strategy. It also gives reminds you of all the things that you have to be thinking about when playing in a tournament.For advanced or expert players, there are a few things in here that might help you improve your game. I like Gordon's advise on how to ""attempt"" to keep yourself from going on tilt after taking a bad beat. We've all been there before, it's nice to know a pros strategy.But for the most part, the strategies laid out, advanced and above players already know, i.e  short stack strategy, odds, pot odds, implied odds, dominated hands, etc. That being said there are some tidbits that might help you fine tune your tournament game and help you improve.If you like playing loose and always pushing the action, this DVD might help you realize the benefits of reeling your game in a little. But if loose is your style then this DVD is not for you, it preaches playing tight and being selective aggressive. This style just doesn't work for some people.The other thing that this does is it really helps you see how the pros (Phil Gordon anyway) see and think about the game. Seeing this can really help you rethink your strategy and help you place higher in a tournament.Also, the on screen hand graphics are the same as you see on TV with the big exception being you only see Gordon's hand. This is a great way to simulate the thought processes of analyzing hands and trying to figure out what an opponent has. Good forethought on this!The entertainment value is good and the lessons it teaches doesn't come across as blah blah blah. Gordon keeps you interested, with his humor and his tone. His experience as host of Celebrity Poker shows through as he hosts this DVD.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that this is not a live tournament. I know it's supposed to a tutorial DVD and it is no doubt the best one out there, but it would have been nice to hear Gordon's comments and insight on live hands and see how he reacts on the fly. While the ending surprised me, the way some of the hands played out was too scripted. I wish everytime I was short stacked at a tournament I got the run of cards Gordon got on the DVD.That being said, they did simulate the times where your strategy on a hand changes from action to action, and it was refreshing to see Gordons reactions. Still, I really wish at least some of the hands weren't scripted.But make no mistake about it, this is a great great learning tool for poker players. For beginners and intermediate players, let me just say I wish this product was available to me when I first started. For advanced players, this might help you tighten some small weaknesses and get you finishing higher up in the money.If Super System is the bible of poker books, then this DVD is the bible of instuctional poker videos.",4,Good poker DVD,1129161600,"10 13, 2005",2005,2894,"['great', 'DVD', 'beginners', 'intermediate', 'players', 'will', 'help', 'tighten', 'up', 'tournament', 'final', 'table', 'strategy', 'also', 'reminds', 'things', 'have', 'be', 'thinking', 'when', 'playing', 'tournament.For', 'advanced', 'expert', 'players', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'here', 'might', 'help', 'improve', 'game', 'like', 'Gordon', 'advise', 'how', 'attempt', 'keep', 'going', 'tilt', 'taking', 'bad', 'beat', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'know', 'pros', 'strategy.But', 'most', 'part', 'strategies', 'laid', 'out', 'advanced', 'above', 'players', 'already', 'know', 'i.e', 'short', 'stack', 'strategy', 'odds', 'pot', 'odds', 'implied', 'odds', 'dominated', 'hands', 'etc', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'tidbits', 'might', 'help', 'fine', 'tune', 'tournament', 'game', 'help', 'improve.If', 'playing', 'loose', 'always', 'pushing', 'action', 'DVD', 'might', 'help', 'realize', 'benefits', 'reeling', 'game', 'little', 'loose', 'style', 'then', 'DVD', 'not', 'playing', 'tight', 'being', 'selective', 'aggressive', 'style', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'people.The', 'other', 'thing', 'really', 'see', 'how', 'pros', 'Phil', 'Gordon', 'anyway', 'see', 'think', 'game', 'Seeing', 'can', 'really', 'help', 'rethink', 'strategy', 'help', 'place', 'higher', 'tournament.Also', 'screen', 'hand', 'graphics', 'are', 'same', 'see', 'TV', 'big', 'exception', 'being', 'only', 'see', 'Gordon', 'hand', 'great', 'way', 'simulate', 'thought', 'processes', 'analyzing', 'hands', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'opponent', 'Good', 'forethought', 'entertainment', 'value', 'good', 'lessons', ""n't"", 'come', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'Gordon', 'interested', 'humor', 'tone', 'experience', 'host', 'Celebrity', 'Poker', 'DVD.The', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'not', 'live', 'tournament', 'know', 'supposed', 'tutorial', 'DVD', 'doubt', 'best', 'one', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'hear', 'Gordon', 'comments', 'insight', 'live', 'hands', 'see', 'how', 'fly', 'ending', 'surprised', 'way', 'hands', 'played', 'out', 'was', 'too', 'scripted', 'wish', 'everytime', 'was', 'short', 'stacked', 'tournament', 'got', 'run', 'cards', 'Gordon', 'got', 'DVD.That', 'being', 'said', 'did', 'simulate', 'times', 'where', 'strategy', 'hand', 'changes', 'action', 'action', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'Gordons', 'reactions', 'Still', 'really', 'wish', 'least', 'hands', 'were', ""n't"", 'scripted.But', 'make', 'mistake', 'great', 'great', 'learning', 'tool', 'poker', 'players', 'beginners', 'intermediate', 'players', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'wish', 'product', 'was', 'available', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'advanced', 'players', 'might', 'help', 'tighten', 'small', 'weaknesses', 'get', 'finishing', 'higher', 'up', 'money.If', 'Super', 'System', 'bible', 'poker', 'books', 'then', 'DVD', 'bible', 'instuctional', 'poker', 'videos']",N/A
