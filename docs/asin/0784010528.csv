And the think that there was actually  an Indian soul living inside Jim's body.GET SERIOUS!  I know Jim was  great, he was a great songwriter and also a great poet. But i don't believe  in this &quot;Indian soul&quot; thing and also in the belief that he's  going to be reincarnated as a mojo rising (Whatever that is?)

However, this film(unlike the comments made by most)is not a strict biography. What was covered semi-accurately in the movie was the atmosphere of the sixties and the bands beginnings. Okay, they showed the crazy drunk Morrison that perpetuates the myth, but this guy was more interesting. There are also many stupid inaccuracies. One big one that can easily be proven is the live Ed Sullivan TV appearence. Morrison did not look close into the camera and emphasize the words ""much higher"". I think the guy was on the wrong track big time, but that doesn't take away from his intelligence. He was very smart. The idea of this film was to show all of Morrisons wild antics. It was a big mistake to have Val Kilmer sing some Doors songs, but he did do a very good job of capturing Morrisons personality. There were definetely some good scenes that showed the bands tension and the tumultuous relationship he had with Pamela(Meg Ryan). The natural likeability side of Morrison was missing from the film. Oliver Stone(director)should have delved deeply into the fallen rock stars last days in Paris(alot of material there)which would have been a more facinating watch. Morrisons real death story, the attempted cover up, paranoia by Pam and rushed burial were also missing. Instead we got the glorified figure in the bath tub with slightly religious imagery. That is very movie phony. This guy would have looked a mess. All said and done, the film reached, grabbed on at times and let go; Hey just like Morrison.",2,"""Change the mood from glad to sadness""",1125014400,"08 26, 2005",2005,1622,"['like', 'Doors', 'music', 'Morrison', 'was', 'very', 'charasmatic', 'figure', 'who', 'wrote', 'bizzare', 'interesting', 'lyrics', 'However', 'film', 'comments', 'made', 'most', 'not', 'strict', 'biography', 'What', 'was', 'covered', 'semi-accurately', 'movie', 'was', 'atmosphere', 'sixties', 'bands', 'beginnings', 'Okay', 'showed', 'crazy', 'drunk', 'Morrison', 'myth', 'guy', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'stupid', 'inaccuracies', 'One', 'big', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'proven', 'live', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'TV', 'appearence', 'Morrison', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'close', 'camera', 'emphasize', 'words', 'much', 'higher', 'think', 'guy', 'was', 'wrong', 'track', 'big', 'time', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'intelligence', 'was', 'very', 'smart', 'idea', 'film', 'was', 'show', 'Morrisons', 'wild', 'antics', 'was', 'big', 'mistake', 'have', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'sing', 'Doors', 'songs', 'did', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'Morrisons', 'personality', 'were', 'definetely', 'good', 'scenes', 'showed', 'bands', 'tension', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'had', 'Pamela', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'natural', 'likeability', 'side', 'Morrison', 'was', 'missing', 'film', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'delved', 'deeply', 'fallen', 'rock', 'stars', 'last', 'days', 'Paris', 'alot', 'material', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'facinating', 'watch', 'Morrisons', 'real', 'death', 'story', 'attempted', 'cover', 'up', 'paranoia', 'Pam', 'rushed', 'burial', 'were', 'also', 'missing', 'Instead', 'got', 'glorified', 'figure', 'bath', 'tub', 'slightly', 'religious', 'imagery', 'very', 'movie', 'phony', 'guy', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'mess', 'said', 'done', 'film', 'reached', 'grabbed', 'times', 'let', 'go', 'Hey', 'just', 'Morrison']",N/A

Thankfully, soon after watching this movie I read 'No One Here Gets Out Alive' and I have come to see a better picture of the true Jim Morrison.It seems as if Hollywood is only interested in the abusive side of Morrison and not the more down-to-earth side of Morrison. Oliver Stone made Jim's character so one dimensional... and this is a serious flaw in a movie that is based, for the mostpart, on one man.That being said, Val Kilmer plays a GREAT Jim Morrison. The movie has many fantastic parts: the making of 'Light My Fire', the cinematography in Jim's desert peyote scene, the Miami concert.It is a great film to watch, but definitely read 'No One Here Gets Out Alive' if you want to understand the more human side of Jim Morrison.4/5",4,"Good, But Could Have Been A Lot Better...",1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,884,"['film', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'walked', 'away', 'film', 'thinking', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'jerk', 'who', 'cared', 'only', 'Thankfully', 'soon', 'watching', 'movie', 'read', 'One', 'Here', 'Out', 'Alive', 'have', 'come', 'see', 'better', 'picture', 'true', 'Jim', 'Morrison.It', 'Hollywood', 'only', 'interested', 'abusive', 'side', 'Morrison', 'not', 'more', 'down-to-earth', 'side', 'Morrison', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'made', 'Jim', 'character', 'so', 'one', 'dimensional', 'serious', 'flaw', 'movie', 'based', 'mostpart', 'one', 'man.That', 'being', 'said', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'GREAT', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'movie', 'many', 'fantastic', 'parts', 'making', ""'Light"", 'My', 'Fire', 'cinematography', 'Jim', 'desert', 'peyote', 'scene', 'Miami', 'concert.It', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'definitely', 'read', 'One', 'Here', 'Out', 'Alive', 'want', 'understand', 'more', 'human', 'side', 'Jim', 'Morrison.4/5']",N/A

It is mostly told looking through the usually intoxicated and drugged up frontman, Jim Morrison's eyes. You are drawn into his confusing world and see his visions. The casting is incredible. I have never known much about The Doors, but after seeing clips of the real Morrison on the second disk, you realize how well casted Val Kilmer was. Kilmer even sang the songs in the movie. A story that director Oliver Stone tells is how Kilmer challenged him to listen to a recording of him as Jim Morrison and a few songs of Morrison himself and try to guess who was singing which songs. Stone could not tell the difference! The whole band was well cast. Cast interviews and deleted scences are found on the second disk. Oliver Stone did a fine job. I really don't know how else one could tell such a tale or get you to share the high quite like Stone.

74239,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0784010528,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","My sister is a major fan of this movie, but in all honesty I am not a big fan of The Doors and so seeing the movie was not a huge priority of mine.  After her incessant insisting I decided to give it a try though, and while I can't say that the experience was truly mind-blowing, I can say that I found some very entertaining moments in the film (especially when in regards to the acting).As a whole I don't think that Oliver Stone's `The Doors' works well as a biopic.  It never really gets inside the minds of its subjects.  Its focus is clearly on frontman Jim Morrison and so the rest of the band just gets really nothing more than a passing glance.  Honestly, I don't even remember hearing their names uttered in the film, which is not good for someone who is not familiar with the band since they won't be able to tell who is who.  Stone truly only cares about one thing, and that is immortalizing Morrison.  Thankfully he has Val Kilmer in the lead, and Val was utterly perfect as Morrison.  I wish that the script would have given Kilmer a little more to chew on, for then his performance could have proved to be iconic, but even with the little he is given he manages to sink deep inside Morrison and bring to life his uncanny draw.Stone is a very interesting director.  I don't think that I have yet to be completely enamored with any one of his films; they always seem to be a bit off for me (I have yet to see `JFK' though, and I hear that is his finest film).  He does a decent job of constructing this biopic, but in the end it feels a bit empty, as if we've really learnt nothing about this band, or even Morrison, aside from what he already has divulged to the known world.  We never really get an intimate look at what made this man tick.Stone does use some interesting techniques with this film that give the audience a feeling of being stoned almost, and I think that aspect of the film translates well with the given circumstances of the films focus, but those nice little tweaks are not enough to make up for the lackluster scripting.A biopic of this nature should have a little more meat.Regardless of what you feel about this film in general though, there is no denying that Val Kilmer delivers his career best performance, capturing the mannerisms and the massive appeal that was Jim Morrison.  He transcended the box Stone kept him in and made himself as real as he could to the audience.  At a mere glance his performance could come off as nothing more than imitation but there is an extra shimmer in his eyes that bleed through with a dedication that surpasses mimicry.  I was also very impressed with Meg Ryan, who plays Morrison's girlfriend Pamela Courson.  She has limited screen time but she manages to make her portrayal very honest and memorable.  Her final moments with Kilmer are heartbreaking in their honesty.`The Doors' is not the best biopic out there, but it has its moments and is enjoyable.  It feels rather vapid when all is said and done (somewhat like `The Notorious Betty Page', which I recently reviewed) but like `Betty', `The Doors' lives and dies with one tremendous performance, and Kilmer's performance keeps this passable film breathing.",3,Didn't quite light my fire...,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,3191,"['sister', 'major', 'fan', 'movie', 'honesty', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Doors', 'so', 'seeing', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'huge', 'priority', 'mine', 'incessant', 'insisting', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'experience', 'was', 'truly', 'mind-blowing', 'can', 'say', 'found', 'very', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'regards', 'acting', '.As', 'whole', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Doors', 'works', 'well', 'biopic', 'never', 'really', 'minds', 'subjects', 'focus', 'clearly', 'frontman', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'so', 'rest', 'band', 'just', 'really', 'nothing', 'more', 'passing', 'glance', 'Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'hearing', 'names', 'uttered', 'film', 'not', 'good', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'familiar', 'band', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'who', 'who', 'Stone', 'truly', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'immortalizing', 'Morrison', 'Thankfully', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'lead', 'Val', 'was', 'utterly', 'perfect', 'Morrison', 'wish', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Kilmer', 'little', 'more', 'chew', 'then', 'performance', 'could', 'have', 'proved', 'be', 'iconic', 'even', 'little', 'given', 'sink', 'deep', 'Morrison', 'bring', 'life', 'uncanny', 'draw.Stone', 'very', 'interesting', 'director', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'yet', 'be', 'completely', 'enamored', 'one', 'films', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'bit', 'off', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'JFK', 'hear', 'finest', 'film', 'decent', 'job', 'constructing', 'biopic', 'end', 'bit', 'empty', ""'ve"", 'really', 'learnt', 'nothing', 'band', 'even', 'Morrison', 'aside', 'what', 'already', 'divulged', 'known', 'world', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'intimate', 'look', 'what', 'made', 'man', 'tick.Stone', 'use', 'interesting', 'techniques', 'film', 'give', 'audience', 'feeling', 'being', 'stoned', 'almost', 'think', 'aspect', 'film', 'well', 'given', 'circumstances', 'films', 'focus', 'nice', 'little', 'tweaks', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'lackluster', 'scripting.A', 'biopic', 'nature', 'should', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'meat.Regardless', 'what', 'feel', 'film', 'general', 'denying', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'career', 'best', 'performance', 'capturing', 'mannerisms', 'massive', 'appeal', 'was', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'transcended', 'box', 'Stone', 'kept', 'made', 'as', 'real', 'could', 'audience', 'mere', 'glance', 'performance', 'could', 'come', 'off', 'nothing', 'more', 'imitation', 'extra', 'shimmer', 'eyes', 'bleed', 'dedication', 'mimicry', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'impressed', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'who', 'Morrison', 'girlfriend', 'Pamela', 'Courson', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'make', 'portrayal', 'very', 'honest', 'memorable', 'final', 'moments', 'Kilmer', 'are', 'heartbreaking', 'honesty.', 'Doors', 'not', 'best', 'biopic', 'there', 'moments', 'enjoyable', 'rather', 'vapid', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'somewhat', 'Notorious', 'Betty', 'Page', 'recently', 'reviewed', 'Betty', 'Doors', 'lives', 'dies', 'one', 'tremendous', 'performance', 'Kilmer', 'performance', 'passable', 'film', 'breathing']",N/A

Val Kilmer plays the role of Jim Morrison and even thought a little extreme at sometimes does a good job, VERY GOOD!  True, the movie is a little over the top and Jim wasn't necessarily as evil as they made him but it got the main points, he loved excess and was always breaking ground, the rules, and got into trouble.  The end is very short compared to the rest of the movie but that's how it was, no one knew for sure if Jim had really died of a heart attack, drugs, etc. and no autopsy was made, therefore Oliver Stone didnt' add his own little twist like he did with JFK and Platoon.  This is a classic rock bio pic and deserves more recognition than it is getting.  I don't own the DVD or any of the movie but I've seen it many times and I just know that the DVD has the interviews plus the missing parts from the movie so I bet it's good.  The movie has some great concert sequences I think, recapturing the Doors while they were live and Val doing his best Jim Morrison screams and singing which makes me wish he sang &quot;Light my fire&quot; and &quot;Roadhouse blues&quot; on vh1 storytellers instead of Scott Staap who thinks he's more Eddie Vedder than Jim Morrison, I bet Jim isn't too pleased with someone like Scott singing his songs but oh well.

OK, not exactly, but if Jimmy was THAT physically active wouldn't he have had a case of terminal johnson blisters?Recently seeing this movie again reminded me of how handsome Val Kilmer was in his youth. Physically he makes a superb Morrison, can even sing like the man. Yes, the music is just great here and the actors playing the other members of the Doors work well in their roles.Crispin Glover's Andy Warhol is also interesting (in a creepy sort of way), but this film is good only up to a point. The early story works best, and then you get to that vampire sequence, geez. And how about Meg Ryan's elevator surprise? If I saw what she encountered that night I'd be outta there on the next flight to San Berdoo. Yet Pamela Courson stuck around for more heartbreak, and more, and more, and...Director Stone must have a message here. Surely it isn't: don't shoot too many scenes with a red filter? With Morrison/Kilmer overdrugging, overdrinking, oversexing, overeating and overschmoozing, it has to be: all things in moderation.In a two year period, Janis Joplin died of heroin and booze, Jim Morrison passed away in a bathtub from a heroin OD and Jimi Hendrix asphixiated while regurgitating the 9 sleeping pills he'd swallowed, which apparently was 8 too many. All were only 27. All had made wondrous music. The word ""tragedy"" doesn't begin to describe how Janis, Jim and Jimi left us, and what the world lost in potential new songs as a result. Their deaths marked a turning point in music and in how we fans lived our own lives.Epilogue: Three years after Jim left her, Pamela Courson also died of a heroin overdose.

74245,A1ZKPET0VDG25V,0784010528,"Arthur Bishop ""The Mechanic""","[7, 14]","I saw this movie when it first came out (March 1, 1991).  I was 21 years old, and a huge DOORS fan.  I liked it okay back then, but upon seeing it now, it's boring, and makes it appear that the other members did little or nothing to contribute to the band and its success (Robby Krieger, the guitar player, WROTE 'LIGHT MY FIRE').  I think Val Kilmer does an Oscar-caliber job as Jim, but the others are only there to react to things Jim says and does.  They have no other purpose except to fill in those roles-most anyone could have done that.  I don't think a lot of people realize that Jim Morrison was many things, BUT HE WASN'T A MUSICIAN.  HE DIDN'T PLAY AN INSTRUMENT, and he wasn't THAT great a singer (though I will say that he was damn good when he was good).  THE DOORS were a great band, but that was a long time ago.  As far as the studio albums go, the first two were great, the second two were mediocre (though 'STRANGE DAYS' has a couple of decent tracks), and the last two were hit and miss.  I wasn't there, so I don't know about how they were live (videos and live CDs are NOT THE SAME as being there).  Another reviewer said that Meg Ryan was a poor choice to play Pam.  I agree.  Listening to Stone talk about it on disc 2 tells us why.  Ryan sounds like she was/is unable to comprehend the type of behavior that Pam/Jim engaged in, i.e. drugs, rebellion, etc.  Stone said the same thing about Darryl Hannah regarding her failed attempt to play Darian in WALL STREET (a far superior movie to this one by the way).  I don't understand why Stone would choose to have someone play a role like this when they obviously were unable to 'find and be' the character they were supposed to be portraying.  Stone should have chosen more wisely.  I think Stone's obsession with Jim is the reason this movie is really all about Jim.  Of the many problems in it, the one that probably bothers me the most is that the movie acts like Jim is the center of the universe, as the camera is almost always on him.  But Oliver Stone's Jim Morrison is juvenile, destructive, obnoxious, and often, pointless.  He hardly comes off as a genius, poetic or otherwise.  He suddenly has star status, but the movie doesn't show why-we're supposed to know why.  Yet, why should we care??? The character is despicable, at least that's the way he's written here.  I couldn't even finish the film-I simply didn't care that he was headed for a youthful demise.  When I read 'Riders on the Storm' and 'No One Here Gets Out Alive', I found myself caring about the people involved-not here though.  Moreover, the photography was irritating, to say the least.  I wanted to know about THE DOORS, instead, I got an MTV-type drug trip with DOORS music behind it.  As a big studio movie, I think this fails on all levels except one-Val Kilmer's performance.  As another reviewer noted, this is the best acting he's ever done.  It's too bad that the movie/script he had to work with was/is over-hyped junk.",2,"Incoherent, negative, and not really about THE DOORS...",1115337600,"05 6, 2005",2005,2982,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'March', '1', '1991', 'was', '21', 'years', 'old', 'huge', 'DOORS', 'fan', 'liked', 'okay', 'back', 'then', 'seeing', 'now', 'boring', 'appear', 'other', 'members', 'did', 'little', 'nothing', 'contribute', 'band', 'success', 'Robby', 'Krieger', 'guitar', 'player', 'WROTE', 'MY', 'FIRE', 'think', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Oscar-caliber', 'job', 'Jim', 'others', 'are', 'only', 'there', 'react', 'things', 'Jim', 'have', 'other', 'purpose', 'fill', 'roles-most', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'realize', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'was', 'many', 'things', 'BUT', 'HE', 'WAS', ""N'T"", 'A', 'MUSICIAN', 'HE', 'DID', ""N'T"", 'PLAY', 'AN', 'INSTRUMENT', 'was', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'great', 'singer', 'will', 'say', 'was', 'damn', 'good', 'when', 'was', 'good', 'DOORS', 'were', 'great', 'band', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'As', 'far', 'studio', 'albums', 'go', 'first', 'two', 'were', 'great', 'second', 'two', 'were', 'mediocre', ""'STRANGE"", 'DAYS', 'couple', 'decent', 'tracks', 'last', 'two', 'were', 'hit', 'miss', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'were', 'live', 'videos', 'live', 'CDs', 'are', 'NOT', 'THE', 'SAME', 'being', 'reviewer', 'said', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'was', 'poor', 'choice', 'play', 'Pam', 'agree', 'Listening', 'Stone', 'talk', 'disc', '2', 'tells', 'why', 'Ryan', 'sounds', 'was/is', 'unable', 'comprehend', 'type', 'behavior', 'Pam/Jim', 'engaged', 'i.e', 'drugs', 'rebellion', 'etc', 'Stone', 'said', 'same', 'thing', 'Darryl', 'Hannah', 'regarding', 'failed', 'attempt', 'play', 'Darian', 'WALL', 'STREET', 'far', 'superior', 'movie', 'one', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Stone', 'would', 'choose', 'have', 'someone', 'play', 'role', 'when', 'obviously', 'were', 'unable', ""'find"", 'be', 'character', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'portraying', 'Stone', 'should', 'have', 'chosen', 'more', 'wisely', 'think', 'Stone', 'obsession', 'Jim', 'reason', 'movie', 'really', 'Jim', 'many', 'problems', 'one', 'probably', 'most', 'movie', 'Jim', 'center', 'universe', 'camera', 'almost', 'always', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'juvenile', 'destructive', 'obnoxious', 'often', 'pointless', 'hardly', 'off', 'genius', 'poetic', 'otherwise', 'suddenly', 'star', 'status', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'why-we', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'know', 'why', 'why', 'should', 'care', 'character', 'despicable', 'least', 'way', 'written', 'here', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'finish', 'film-I', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'headed', 'youthful', 'demise', 'When', 'read', ""'Riders"", 'Storm', ""'No"", 'One', 'Here', 'Out', 'Alive', 'found', 'caring', 'people', 'involved-not', 'here', 'Moreover', 'photography', 'was', 'irritating', 'say', 'least', 'wanted', 'know', 'DOORS', 'instead', 'got', 'MTV-type', 'drug', 'trip', 'DOORS', 'music', 'big', 'studio', 'movie', 'think', 'levels', 'one-Val', 'Kilmer', 'performance', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'best', 'acting', 'ever', 'done', 'too', 'bad', 'movie/script', 'had', 'work', 'was/is', 'over-hyped', 'junk']",N/A

There are more special effects in The Doors than in Star Wars.  I think this movie represents a change in Oliver Stone's career.  I didn't like some of his earlier films as much as other people.  The most interesting films to me were the ones where he used a lot of special photography to convey the message like JFK, Nixon, Any Given Sunday, even Natural Born Killers (although I think Killers hits a doorstop in the prison scenes).  There are scenes in Killers that have the kind of visual exuberance and improvisations inherent in the message, almost like a fairy tale.The Doors uses cinema the way Apocalypse Now uses cinema.  What I mean by that is the montages, the feeling of immersion, the adult manner in which the cinema handles the plot.  It pulls out the stops and goes as deep as the mental state it portrays without being too ""preachy"".  Those are Stone's preferable qualities to me.  The Oliver Stone films lacking those presentation techniques I speak of were shot so gritty to the extent of degrading the moral, and they had little beauty or gloss in them, which are the things that were put into The Doors and the above few I mentioned.Stone's better films are the ones like this one that treats his subjects as fairy tales for adults.  They are the ones that take me on a colorful ride and display what those things look like in one's imagination, and then plays with them like fairy tales.  They should be vivid and colorful.

You will learn so much about the band, and specifically Jim Morrison.

A variety of songs throughout the first six studio albums, and even some surprising lesser known songs can be heard at times, such as ""Love Street"" and ""Five to One"".  I wasn't expecting to hear those songs.The story of how ""Light my Fire"" was created is a really good one too.  The constant drugs and drinking that Morrison did is all mentioned and detailed here as well.  Also, the part where the Doors weren't allowed to say ""girl you couldn't get much higher"" from the famous Ed Sullivan bit is included.  I like how Ed wanted the band to be happier and not so gloomy when they were sitting around in their dressing rooms and waiting to go out there and perform, haha.  We can look back and see the Doors simply didn't WANT to be the happy cheery type.I guess Jim Morrison was shy at first and didn't want to perform in front of big crowds, which explains why the first performance the Doors ever did, Jim had his back to the audience.

Through using The Doors actual music (what was missing from the recent Sylvia, the art of the subject itself - her poetry) to help tell its story and colour its scenes, and filmic techniques to create the drug-induced world vision of Jim Morrison, Stone really takes you into the world of his movie, and the world of the sixties.This movie made me appreciate what an exciting experience The Doors were, and has actually cultivated love in me for their music. I didn't realise they had more than one classic: Light my Fire, The End, People are Strange, Love her Madly, Break on Through to the Other Side, Riders on the Storm, Touch Me, Roadhouse Blues (Let it roll, baby roll) and probably more i'm yet to discover.For a better recreation of what Andy Warhol's factory actually felt like, see I Shot Andy Warhol. Crispin Glover actually looks more like Andy than the guy who plays him in &quot;I Shot,&quot; but the guy in I Shot much better captured Andy's vagueness and almost unconsciousness while in conversation. This, however, is but three minutes in the movie and has no effect on it as a whole.Oliver Stone has an amusing cameo: a young film student, Jim Morrison, shows his short film to his class, who are uncouth and disparaging about it, after which camera pans to reveal Oliver Stone standing at the lecturn, (obviously, playing the film professor), who says: &quot;Why don't we ask the author what he thinks?&quot;",4,Absorbing movie - i didn't want it to end.

I read somewhere that during filming he immersed himself so deeply in the role that a note was passed around the set instructing everyone to address him as ""Jim"" at all times, off-camera as well as on.  He went deep into the psyche of his character and it shows.  I also saw an interview with one of the existing former members of the Doors, who said that in some scenes, watching Kilmer play Jim onstage gave him chills...he felt as if he was watching Jim, for real.

They so embodied the West Coast counterculture experience that viewing this biographical film about Jim Morrison and The Doors also provides a fascinating view of the cultural and spiritual forces that drove Jim and that entire generation to challenge the status quo of the American mainstream.What exactly is the true story of the life and death of Jim Morrison? Is it the story of one of the many rebellious young adults of the time who in looking for an alternative way of living got lost along the way in the drugs, alcohol and sexual freedom that so dominated that culture? Or is Jims' story a deeply mystical tale announcing the rebirth of ancient shamanism into the collective consciousness of the twentieth century? The story of someone chosen by the spirits to bring the 'old ways' to a new generation looking for something to fill the spiritual void brought about by the loss of belief in the Christian God?Director Oliver Stone has played the mythmaker to perfection in this amazing film providing us with the unique experience of entering into the American Dreamtime. Layering mundane worldly events intermitently with glimpses of the psychic, shamanic forces motivating those events we are given the opportunity to chose for ourselves what level of reality we are willing, or ready to accept. A truly remarkable accomplishment.As for the performance of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison, it couldn't have been better. His ability to capture both the physcial appearance and dark persona of the legendary rock star so completely is beyond extraordinary. Without question Val was born to play this role.Did Jim really believe he was the ""Electric Shaman"" called by the spirits to open the ""Doors of Perception"" to a sleeping world? Was he Dionysus reborn, here to use his suggestive music and lyrics to arouse his followers and bring to fruition his new 'Rites of Spring' with ""Golden copulations in the streets of L.A."" More likely he was playing the part of the mischevious Indian 'Trickster' leading us once again in the wrong direction. Maybe it's just like his Mother said long ago while the old Indian lay dying along the roadside in the California desert.

74258,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0784010528,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 7]","The Doors, directed by Oliver Stone and starring Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison is an epic and visually stunning film that attempts to tell not only about the rise and fall of a band, and in particular its singer, a complex and enigmatic figure, but also about the ""Strange Days"" of a unique period in history known as The 60's. People who complain about the facts being distorted are missing the point. Due to the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy, this film isn't aiming for objective truth. It is Stone's vision, and besides, a lot of the events didn't occur in the physical realm at all:------Jim Morrison: I believe in a long prolonged derangement of the senses to attain the unknown... Although I live in the subconscious, our pale reason hides the infinite from us.=================What we have with Morrison is a rock star who wanted to be a poet--who was a poet. He wanted to be Dionysus, the god of wine, the inspirer of ritual madness and ecstasy, and he became Dionysus. In becoming the physical embodiment of Dionysus on Earth he may have fudged his facts. He may have neglected to mention that his father was an Admiral, rather than deceased as he claimed. In creating his own myth, he may have played fast and loose with the truth, but once again, you are missing the point.""Mr Mojo Risin"" is an anagram for ""Jim Morrison""Val Kilmer really wanted to play this role, and he tried very hard to be cast, even going as far as recording a demo of himself singing Doors songs. According to Stone and some band members, when given the blindfold test with Kilmer's tape, they couldn't tell the difference. From the first frame of The Doors he IS Jim Morrison. He starts out as a young and relatively innocent Jim Morrison and carries the character through to his final days as a bloated and bearded beast. Jim Morrison was the self proclaimed Lizard King. Morrison WAS the Lizard King, but he could also be an obnoxious drunk, and both things are true. Val Kilmer gave an awesome performance as Jim Morrison, both the poet and the obnoxious drunk, both the man and the myth.Aiding and abetting Val Kilmer's performance, just as The Doors ably supported Morrison, was an excellent cast with a few standouts that I would like to mention:Kyle MacLachlan as Doors Keyboardist Ray Manzarek, Kevin Dillon as drummer John Densmore, and Frank Whaley as guitarist Robby Krieger were very supportive. They kind of stayed in the background, but as sidemen that is their gig. When you have a charismatic actor like Val Kilmer playing an even more charismatic singer like Jim Morrison, you know you're not going to steal the show. They all learned how to play their instruments, which took a lot of time and practice, though MacLachlan may have had it in his blood already, as he claims he's a descendent of Johan Sebastion Bach.Michael Madsen was Tom Baker, an actor best known for a Warhol film, ""I, a Man"" but he was friends with Morrison long before that. In the film, I got the impression that they met through Warhol, but the reverse is true. Morrison was supposed to play opposite Nico, but management talked him out of it, and he suggested his drinkin' buddy Tom Baker for the role. Anyway, Madsen is menacing as Baker, even though Morrison has already descended to a pretty depraved level, you are concerned when Madsen shows up. Uh oh, this guy is a really bad influence! Actually, Madsen provides one of the best scenes, when Baker berates Morrison for becoming a bloated beast and belittles his accomplishments:-----------Tom Baker: [to Jim] Whatcha gonna do for act three, man? Puke on Heaven's door?=================Billy Idol as Cat has a good comeback, though. He tells Baker that IF he ever does anything, please tell him so he can whiz on it. Billy Idol was supposed to have a much bigger role but due to a motorcycle accident, it was severely curtailed. A pity.Meg Ryan gave a great performance as Pamela Courson, Jim's girlfriend. She was somewhere between Sally Albright in ""When Harry Met Sally"" and Bonnie in ""Hurlyburly."" Kind of a girl-next-door, all bright and bubbly, who with prolonged exposure to Jim's decadence becomes a bonnie bit of guttersnipe. Ryan wavered between and balanced the two extremes well.Kathleen Quinlan portrayed Patricia Keneally well. Patricia was a rock journalist who questions some of the facts in Morrison's self made myth, but also falls for the devil may care singer. In fact, she's a practicing Wiccan and the two are wed in a Handfast ceremony. Quinlan was also in Apollo 13, giving her a Bacon Number of 1. The real Keneally complained that she was falsely depicted, but Stone admits she was a composite character culled from perhaps 10 different women, compressed into her character in the name of dramatic economy.Michael Wincott also made quite an impression as record producer Paul Rothchild. Though he no doubt looked nothing like the man who had produced the first six of The Doors albums, besides lots of other credits to his name, Wincott gave another of his trade marked intense performances. Catch him in ""Basquiat"" if you want to see more of his work.Like Mr Mojo Risin', Oliver Stone is likewise in the myth creation business. He bent the facts to dramatize the story and make it more cinematic. I wasn't buying so much Oliver Stone's use of the Indian Shaman as metaphor, but I will allow him such conceits. Director Oliver Stone felt a deep connection to the singer that began when Stone was a soldier in Viet Nam. He wasn't a popular music person before that, but hearing The Doors music really struck a chord. His first screenplay, which formed the basis for his film ""Platoon"" was originally envisioned with the main character played by Jim Morrison, and Stone actually contacted Morrison about playing the role. Stone sees The Doors as filling the void in all that Flower Power during the 60's. They were the darkness amidst all that sunshine. He sees a parallel with himself in that he's an artist who goes to that dark place, who pushes into that deep, dark abyss.There are a lot of people who didn't like his depiction of Jim Morrison and The Doors, but I take a different view. Ray Manzarek has since said that the movie is a horrible account of the history of the band. Ray did not participate or contribute in the making of the film, though he was asked. Maybe his dissatisfaction prompted him to write his own book in 1998: *Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors*. The other two band members, Krieger and Densmore, participated in the film. In fact, Krieger wanted Stone to do the project because he was a fan of the film ""Salvador"" and he convinced the other Doors to sign on. Densmore's book, *Riders on the Storm: My Life with Jim Morrison and the Doors*, an account of the band's rise and fall from his own perspective, was a primary source of material for the film. It took 20 years for the film to be made, mostly due to getting permission from the band and family members.So, bottom line: It was Oliver Stone's tribute to Jim Morrison, and if other people saw him differently, they should write their own book or make their own movie. If you want to learn more about Jim, read those other books, or better yet read his poetry and listen to his music.It's fitting that Jim Morrison is buried in Cimeti&egrave;re du P&egrave;re Lachaise, alongside such poets and artists as Honor&eacute; de Balzac, Guillaume Apollinaire, Sarah Bernhardt, Georges Bizet, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin, Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix, Isadora Duncan, St&eacute;phane Grappelli, Amedeo Modigliani, Moliere, Yves Montand, &Eacute;dith Piaf, Marcel Proust, Gioacchino Rossini, Georges-Pierre Seurat, Gertrude Stein, Alice B.

The Doors film is one of legendary proportions, often portraying the excessive more so then the intellectual elements that occurred. With so much coverage on Jim, as so with almost every Doors related book and article we'd think the DOORS MOVIE would maybe shed some light off the lizard king?No, this movie is strongly centric on Morrison. As a movie though it holds up, it's interesting and lengthy. As a portrayal it has hits and rapid fire misses. Trippy effects, surreal warmly euphoric moments, bizarre lighting it's all here.Unlike other movies there is no main underlying problem anyone sets out to fix, after all it's meant to be somewhat real right? Stone has fudged the truth to make possibly quick a buck or add the missing elements needed for a hit (like it wouldn't have been already). Jim Morrison was a funny, passionate, at times other worldly guy. While that is shown in brief amounts through speeches, we see his other capable side amplified. The side capable of inciting crowds, dangling off buildings to incite more people, and drinking heavily to incite the people around him. He was also a very deep thinker with a supposed IQ of 149, we find ourselves missing wondering where the other 49 went in this film. He's portrayed a sociopath with a drinking problem more so then the poet we've come to know him as.Aside from my little rant the movie is rather enjoyable. Good music is good music and the Doors had a wonderful catalog of music. A good movie is a good movie, it offers a colorful view on an era so hazily colored. When combined it works nicely, but the falsities are my underlying disapproval of anything greater then average toward this film. As a movie it holds its own, as a tribute to an amazing band it's a bit upsetting.----------------------------------------------------------------------Quick run down:Pros: Great renditions of a classic rock group, provides some uniquely odd scenes, insightful for quite a few Doors related things, impressive acting.Cons: Detaches from reality, endorses a destructive lifestyle without the conscious normal views of these people, some scenes grow boring due to length.",3,I'll Make This One Fast,1247875200,"07 18, 2009",2009,2273,"['Everyone', 'covered', 'views', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'more', 'detail', 'length', 'then', 'actual', 'time', 'limelight', 'point', 'Doors', 'film', 'one', 'legendary', 'proportions', 'often', 'portraying', 'excessive', 'more', 'so', 'then', 'intellectual', 'elements', 'occurred', 'so', 'much', 'coverage', 'Jim', 'so', 'almost', 'Doors', 'related', 'book', 'article', ""'d"", 'think', 'DOORS', 'MOVIE', 'would', 'maybe', 'shed', 'light', 'lizard', 'king', 'No', 'movie', 'strongly', 'centric', 'Morrison', 'movie', 'up', 'interesting', 'lengthy', 'portrayal', 'hits', 'rapid', 'fire', 'misses', 'Trippy', 'effects', 'surreal', 'warmly', 'euphoric', 'moments', 'bizarre', 'lighting', 'here.Unlike', 'other', 'movies', 'main', 'underlying', 'problem', 'anyone', 'out', 'fix', 'meant', 'be', 'somewhat', 'real', 'right', 'Stone', 'fudged', 'truth', 'make', 'possibly', 'quick', 'buck', 'add', 'missing', 'elements', 'needed', 'hit', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'already', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'was', 'funny', 'passionate', 'times', 'other', 'worldly', 'guy', 'shown', 'brief', 'amounts', 'speeches', 'see', 'other', 'capable', 'side', 'amplified', 'side', 'capable', 'inciting', 'crowds', 'dangling', 'off', 'buildings', 'incite', 'more', 'people', 'drinking', 'heavily', 'incite', 'people', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'deep', 'thinker', 'supposed', 'IQ', '149', 'find', 'missing', 'wondering', 'where', 'other', '49', 'went', 'film', 'portrayed', 'sociopath', 'drinking', 'problem', 'more', 'so', 'then', 'poet', ""'ve"", 'come', 'know', 'as.Aside', 'little', 'rant', 'movie', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'Good', 'music', 'good', 'music', 'Doors', 'had', 'wonderful', 'catalog', 'music', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'movie', 'colorful', 'view', 'era', 'so', 'hazily', 'colored', 'When', 'combined', 'nicely', 'falsities', 'are', 'underlying', 'disapproval', 'anything', 'greater', 'then', 'average', 'film', 'movie', 'own', 'tribute', 'amazing', 'band', 'bit', 'upsetting.', 'Quick', 'run', 'down', 'Pros', 'Great', 'renditions', 'classic', 'rock', 'group', 'uniquely', 'odd', 'scenes', 'insightful', 'quite', 'few', 'Doors', 'related', 'things', 'impressive', 'acting.Cons', 'Detaches', 'reality', 'destructive', 'lifestyle', 'conscious', 'normal', 'views', 'people', 'scenes', 'grow', 'boring', 'due', 'length']",N/A

Remember people the Doors were only around for 5 years. Until Morrison's untimely death. The rest of the Doors are protrayed as innocent bystanders.

74273,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,0784010528,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 3]","Calling this movie ""The Doors"" is misleading. It would be more accurate to call it ""Jim Morrison and Those Other Guys In the Band,"" since that is how it's presented.It's always tempting to latch onto a rock legend in these rock biopics, and Oliver Stone clings like a limpet to the ghost of Jim Morrison. Acid-soaked scenery and mysticism are in every scene, but Stone seems content to wallow in the rock'n'roll debauchery rather than get into Morrison's head.It opens with a voiceover of Jim Morrison's poetry, as we slowly fade into a stalled recording session. Then it flips back to 1949, as Morrison's family drives through the desert. The boy catches a glimpse of several Indians by the road -- and one of them dies as the family leaves.Then it flips ahead to Morrison's (Val Kilmer) years at college -- he crashes a party for a pretty girl, makes arty films, acid-trips, and devotes himself to poetry. Then his pal Ray Manzarek (Kyle McLachlan) creates a rock band, with Morrison's poetry and voice as the centerpiece. Soon The Doors become a fixture in L.A. -- and then a famed band.But as the Doors become more famous, Morrison increasingly loses himself in the messianic-Dionysian-rocker role that has been set out for him. He weds a witch-journalist (Katherine Quinlan) but loves his fey girlfriend Pamela (Meg Ryan). And when he outrages the authorities with the threat of public exposure, the spiral starts that will only lead to death.Stone certainly knew how to evoke the golden ages of rock'n'roll. Lots of sex, kinetic concerts, and bizarre behavior where Morrison jumps up on platforms and screams, ""I am the Lizard King! I can do anything!"" The whole movie just kind of sweeps you off your feet.And Stone is quite brilliant with the direction. The movie is filmed like an acid trip -- shifting multicoloured skies, Indian ghosts, shadows on the sand, and eerie lighting. And it touches on other aspects of the late sixties -- the Factory, Nico, and the belief that something violent and beautiful was about to erupt.Unfortunately, Stone seems so enamored of the atmosphere that he never quite gets around to making a biopic. The other Doors are relegated to a frame for Morrison's bizarre behavior, and after the first half hour, they basically fade away. And he gets too enamored of his own style with the Indian ghost, and the arty ""dead man"" final scenes.Val Kilmer does a shockingly good job with the languid, unpredictable energy of Morrison. He sings well too. Sadly, his performance is stuck in a one-note character -- Stone opts to potray him just as a random, sleazy, wild jerk, and we don't get a single insight into his thoughts. Sure, Morrison could be horrible. But this is Jim Morrison as rock cliche, not as a human being.And sadly, none of the other actors get much chance to expand on their roles -- the other Doors actors, including MacLachlan, basically play slightly annoyed accessories, and Meg Ryan plays a sweet girl without many other dimensions. Although Crispin Glover has a tiny, memorable role as Andy Warhol.""The Doors"" opens into a beautiful psychedelic movie, but Stone fails to give it a soul. It's a fun biopic full of the sixties atmosphere, but it never quite manages to be much more.",3,"In between, there are doors",1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,3237,"['Calling', 'movie', 'Doors', 'misleading', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'call', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Other', 'Guys', 'Band', 'how', 'presented.It', 'always', 'tempting', 'latch', 'rock', 'legend', 'rock', 'biopics', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'clings', 'limpet', 'ghost', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Acid-soaked', 'scenery', 'mysticism', 'are', 'scene', 'Stone', 'content', 'wallow', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'debauchery', 'rather', 'get', 'Morrison', 'head.It', 'voiceover', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'poetry', 'slowly', 'fade', 'stalled', 'recording', 'session', 'Then', 'back', '1949', 'Morrison', 'family', 'desert', 'boy', 'glimpse', 'several', 'Indians', 'road', 'one', 'family', 'ahead', 'Morrison', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'years', 'college', 'party', 'pretty', 'girl', 'arty', 'films', 'acid-trips', 'poetry', 'Then', 'pal', 'Ray', 'Manzarek', 'Kyle', 'McLachlan', 'rock', 'band', 'Morrison', 'poetry', 'voice', 'centerpiece', 'Doors', 'become', 'fixture', 'L.A.', 'then', 'famed', 'band.But', 'Doors', 'become', 'more', 'famous', 'Morrison', 'increasingly', 'messianic-Dionysian-rocker', 'role', 'been', 'set', 'out', 'witch-journalist', 'Katherine', 'Quinlan', 'fey', 'girlfriend', 'Pamela', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'when', 'authorities', 'threat', 'public', 'exposure', 'spiral', 'starts', 'will', 'only', 'lead', 'death.Stone', 'certainly', 'knew', 'how', 'evoke', 'golden', 'ages', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'Lots', 'sex', 'kinetic', 'concerts', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'where', 'Morrison', 'up', 'platforms', 'screams', 'am', 'Lizard', 'King', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'kind', 'sweeps', 'off', 'feet.And', 'Stone', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'movie', 'filmed', 'acid', 'trip', 'shifting', 'multicoloured', 'skies', 'Indian', 'ghosts', 'shadows', 'sand', 'eerie', 'lighting', 'other', 'aspects', 'late', 'sixties', 'Factory', 'Nico', 'belief', 'something', 'violent', 'beautiful', 'was', 'erupt.Unfortunately', 'Stone', 'so', 'enamored', 'atmosphere', 'never', 'quite', 'making', 'biopic', 'other', 'Doors', 'are', 'relegated', 'frame', 'Morrison', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'basically', 'fade', 'away', 'too', 'enamored', 'own', 'style', 'Indian', 'ghost', 'arty', 'dead', 'man', 'final', 'scenes.Val', 'Kilmer', 'shockingly', 'good', 'job', 'languid', 'unpredictable', 'energy', 'Morrison', 'well', 'too', 'Sadly', 'performance', 'stuck', 'one-note', 'character', 'Stone', 'potray', 'just', 'random', 'sleazy', 'wild', 'jerk', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'single', 'insight', 'thoughts', 'Sure', 'Morrison', 'could', 'be', 'horrible', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'rock', 'cliche', 'not', 'human', 'being.And', 'sadly', 'none', 'other', 'actors', 'get', 'much', 'chance', 'expand', 'roles', 'other', 'Doors', 'actors', 'including', 'MacLachlan', 'basically', 'play', 'slightly', 'annoyed', 'accessories', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'sweet', 'girl', 'many', 'other', 'dimensions', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'tiny', 'memorable', 'role', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'Doors', 'beautiful', 'psychedelic', 'movie', 'Stone', 'give', 'soul', 'fun', 'biopic', 'full', 'sixties', 'atmosphere', 'never', 'quite', 'be', 'much', 'more']",N/A

Not because it interested me so much but more because I had a friend who really wanted to see it when it came out and couldn't. He liked to see films immediately upon their release. I liked to do things that irked him, so I made sure to see the film before he did. This was a surprising film, really. When I heard that Val Kilmer had been cast as Jim Morrison, I, like many, was skeptical that he would be able to pull it off. The Val Kilmer we had to that point come to recognise looked nothing like Morrison in addition to which, Kilmer's roles had never really stretched his ""acting muscles"", so most were convinced that he would fail. However, Kilmer respectably fooled everyone with his convincing portrayal of Morrison. His performance was enjoyable. Meg Ryan was surprising also because her role was a bit of a departure. Still didn't like her, though. Kathleen Quinlan's blood drinking gothic diversion for Morrison was an interesting character. The story was not thrilling, as we all know the story, and in fact, many parts of the film were simply laughable. I noticed at the end when Morrison decides to move to Paris and is saying goodbye to his friends (other Doors members), he and the friends hug and not only do they perform that special ""man hug"" (which is a hug always accompanied by several hard slaps on the back... very manly) but also accompanied with tender sentiments like, ""I'm gonna miss you"" followed by the tempering insult, ""you a**hole"".

To truly watch this movie, you need to put on the DVD, turn off all of the lights, and crank the sound.  It will trance you out...which is part of the point, I believe.This isn't so much a movie about Jim Morrison and the Doors as it is about shamanism, about the dangers of ""breaking on through to the other side.""  Yes, the director played fast and loose with some of the facts, but that wasn't his goal--this movie is clearly about Jim Morrison as Dionysus, about his obsession with love and death and seeking to open the doors of perception.  He remade himself as a shaman/poet, as having the soul of an Indian medicine man, and used drink and drugs to alter his consciousness.  The problem is (as with many) eventually this took its toll and he drank and used drugs to escape from reality, rather than to expand his awareness of true reality.  This movie shows both aspects of being a shaman and a poet.You really need to watch this movie through the eyes of understanding the metaphor and symbology it uses.  Death pursues Jim throughout the movie...in one scene, he dances both on the stage and around the fire with the audience.  He dances with other medicine men.  And then that is taken away from him because it was time for him to be torn apart by his ""followers""...only they don't oblige.  They just don't get it.  If he was Dionysus, then they were supposed to consume him.One of the best bits in the movie takes place at the Whiskey, when even the go-go dancers stop and listen entranced to what he is telling them...when he sings about the ancient ""snake,"" the snake that Morrison asks us to ""kiss,"" the snake of whom we are all a part of.  I can understand why the audience was portrayed as becoming tranced out during that scene, because the song ""The End,"" does entrance you, both in the context of the movie and when you listen to it on a CD.The movie, The Doors, is a poem, a song, a myth.

74277,AY12DBB0U420B,0784010528,Gary Peterson,"[3, 6]","Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Doors,"" a film by Oliver Stone. If you enjoy rock 'n' roll and the life-style that seems to be associated with it, then you might enjoy this film. The Doors were a rock group whose leader, Jim Morrison, was a beach dude from Venice, California, and who's personal theme song was ""The World Owes Me A Living."" Jim met up with another Venice beach person who liked his poetry and first thing you know a couple other guys joined and they put together a band which quickly became popular. It was on to Whiskey A Go-Go, a Los Angeles dive for up and coming bands, then on to San Francisco, a recording contract and off to New York City, all in a very short time span. Burning the candle at both ends became a way of life. The Doors fame quickly grew and their records hit big-time and the funding rolled in. Jim Morrison's ego quickly inflated to mega-proportions and he began to hold everyone in contempt, his venue owners, the police, his loyal girlfriend, his band-mates and, ultimately, even his fans, while he proclaimed that life wasn't worth living and that he wanted to die. His intake of intoxicants was prodigious and he favored hard booze, guzzled straight from the bottle. His shows gradually became intoxicated brawls until, finally, he died of heart problems at the old age of 29. Okay, I've glossed it over a bit but that's the general gist. It's an interesting story and the general outline fits more than one rock group.The movie was quite excellent, in my opinion. Well done! The acting was believable. You could actually feel as if you're a member of the entourage and are going through this ridiculous rise and fall right along with Morrison and his bandmates. Some died-in-the-wool Doors fans, of  which there are many, may find the Oliver Stone depiction to be harsh and unrealistic and I have no way of judging this matter. Most of the Doors extremely popular songs have faded with 60s' memories and styles. I haven't heard any of the songs on ""Oldies but Goodies"" stations for several decades. It's good hearing the Doors music again in the context of the times. Very enjoyable. The Doors have become one of the music critics legendary darlings, so a lot of interesting extra materials are included on a second disc. Be sure to view it. This is quite a worthwhile DVD packet, whether you liked the Doors or not.Gary Peterson",5,The Rise and Fall Of The Legendary Doors.

However, this movie plays very loose with the truth on many aspects of the Doors' Music Career. The story jumps so quickly from Ray and Jim's meeting on Venice Beach to the band recording Light My Fire.  Nothing is mentioned on how Densmore and Kreiger joined the band. Val Kilmer was a good choice for the role of Jim Morrison.  However too much of the film dwelled on Jim's demons.  Oliver Stone portrays Morrison as an evil person whether he was drunk or not.  In addition, he gives the viewers the impression that there was a great deal of tension between Morrison and Manzarek. Just note the tension at the party between Ray and Jim during the infamous &quot;duck&quot; incident. This is simply not true.  Just read through Light My Fire and you will realize that Jim Morrison was a good person with alot of problems.I enjoy hearing the Doors songs and they lead well into some of the scenes particularly when Val sings The Spy to Pamela.  The concert footage is fabulous as Val really pushes the right buttons.  The airport scene is pretty cool as well.  The lighting and scenery is certainly well done.Most fans of the band will probably enjoy this film as long as they take it in a light hearted way.

Not only does Kilmer resemble Morrison but he sings eerily similar - so much so that several surviving members of the band were fooled. The early concert scenes are the highlight here but once The Doors get famous the film sinks into extended, bizarre concert shots and Morrison becomes a whiskey guzzling cliche working his way to his eventual demise in a Paris hotel bathtub. Kevin Dillon as Robby Kreiger is effective and Kyle MacLachlan as drummer Ray Manzerek is OK but Meg Ryan is hopelessly miscast as Morrison's longtime love  Pamela Courson, who died of a heroin overdose three years after Morrison. Oliver Stone has commented in the years after the film (and in Disc 2's Making of Featurette) that Ryan never connected with the role and that she played it as if she were constipated. The film also falters as it attempts to go deep into Morrison's head to explain his damaged psyche.

74294,A1EBJ93E1T50RT,0784010528,Jason A. Miller,"[4, 8]","One of my favorite stories about Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" comes secondhand, from a guy I know who saw the movie with a female acquaintaince.  About halfway through, she asked him, ""What year did Jim Morrison die?"", to which he replied, ""1971.""  ""And what year is it now?"" ""1968.""  She then sighed, a long and bored sigh.""The Doors"" is not easy viewing.  It is also not a strict biography of the band The Doors, because if it were, Frank Whaley and Kevin Dillon actually would have had something to do in the movie, rather than become perhaps the highest-paid extras in Hollywood history.Once you understand these two joint concepts -- that Oliver Stone is making a movie about an idea rather than about a specific chain of actual events -- ""The Doors"" becomes essential viewing, not just the story of another band, but rather about a band that tried to break on through and redefine a generation's consciousness.  Until the lead singer burned himself out.Jim Morrison quite clearly burrowed deeper into his own mind than most of us would care to go.  This trip, pardon the pun, unearthed song lyrics that were alternately of breathtaking clarity (""The Unknown Soldier"") or revoltingly disjointed (""Not to Touch the Earth"")... and that was on the same album.  By that same token, some scenes in ""The Doors"" are wonderful: the moment when Morrison composes the second verse of ""Light My Fire"" as an improv.  Other scenes go on forever and do nothing but make you loathe the man: the live performance of ""Not to Touch the Earth""; any scene in which he asks a woman to ""die for"" him.Where the DVD is occasionally hurt by the loss of subtitles (the dialogue in many scenes is unintelligible), Stone's director commentary is surprisingly spare and informative.  There's not much rambling here.  He explains which scenes were real, which were imagined (albeit based on real moments), which characters are composites.I had no idea, before watching the DVD, that one of Stone's associates actually appears as Death, perhaps a dozen times, at first shortly after a direct quote from ""The Seventh Seal"", and then engaged in a progressive interplay with Morrison that climaxes at a birthday party late in the film.  Stone's commentary on Death's role in the movie plays a bit like a routine from ""The Simpsons"": ""That's death!"" ""No, Grampa, that's Patricia Kennealy."" ""That's death!"" ""No, Grampa, that's Nico."" ""That's DEATH!"" ""No, Grampa, that's Patricia Kennealy again.""Similarly, I knew that Floyd Red Crow Westerman played an Indian shaman supposedly transferred into Morrison's soul; I did not know that one scene in the movie shows him departing, clearly fed up with the increasing chaos.This movie may never have worked without Val Kilmer.  It is impossible to tell where he ends and Morrison begins.  Kilmer seems to recognize that this movie is not a linear bio; even in scenes firmly rooted in historical fact (the meeting with Ray Manzarek on Venice Beach in 1965), Kilmer plays Morrison as stoned immaculate.

And although the film is called the doors, don't be mistaken that every band member gets equal screen time.  Sure there are moments when they are indeed a &quot;tribe of warriors&quot; as Morrison puts it, but indeed Stone puts most of the focus on Moorison himself and what might've led to his destruction.This is helped immensly by Val Kilmer, exceptionally paying attention to every Jim Moorison detail and very nicely mirroring Meg Ryan's portrayal of Pamela Susan Moorison.  Also, the music scene is very acurately depicted in the film for those interested, with a funny moment involving a Ed Sullivan look a-like.  The only flaw is that if you already knew a good amount about the Doors, the insight is actually quite little.  But of course, that's only for those who know alot.

Jim was a bit of a wild man during this psychedelic era, and the movie totally reflects that -- excessive drugs, wild antics on and off stage, etc.  One of my favorite scenes is when The Doors are invited to play on The Ed Sullivan Show and are asked to censor ""Light My Fire.""  They don't, and Val exaggerates the moment way beyond what actually happened.  A classic scene.There are a few inaccuracies in the film which knocks my rating down one star.

74301,A21Z4IVGGR7ZJ5,0784010528,JOHN P. HANSSEN,"[3, 4]","First, let me start off by saying that Val Kilmer's performance in this film is nothing short of genius.  He literally became Jim Morrison, almost to the point that I thought that Val was actually a mental patient who thought he WAS Jim Morrison.  There are many times during the film that I had to tell myself that it wasn't Jim that had come back from the dead.  Second, Oliver Stone is a brilliant director and he can make the viewer feel as if he has just stepped into a time machine and gone back to visit the 60's--that's how authentic the setting is in this movie.However, the problem that I sometimes have with Oliver Stone is that he has a tendancy to go a little to overboard in his films, and ""The Doors"" is a perfect example of this.  We all know that Jim Morrison was a troubled soul, but, hey, let's face it--most of your artistic geniuses are, which what makes their work so incredible.  Stone, however, made Jim Morrison out to be some acid-draining Nazi that cared only about himself and had violent outbursts all the time.  In reality, though, if one does a little research, one finds out that Jim was only like that some of the time and not every second of his life.  This movie, I felt, failed to show more of the beautiful maverick poet/shaman that Jim, most of the time, really was.Also, I felt that the sex angle was overplayed a bit, as well.  Obviously Jim had slept with a number of women, and the women that weren't able to, most likely fantasized about being with Jim.  However, it was if this film made Jim out to be so horny that he would actually have sex with mannequins at the local department store.In reality, when all is said and done, the only real saving grace of this film was Val Kilmer's outstanding performance as well as Stone's accurate re-creation of the trippin' sixties.",3,Stoned--but not exactly immaculate,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,1817,"['First', 'let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'performance', 'film', 'nothing', 'short', 'genius', 'literally', 'became', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'almost', 'point', 'thought', 'Val', 'was', 'actually', 'mental', 'patient', 'who', 'thought', 'WAS', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'had', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'Jim', 'had', 'come', 'back', 'dead', 'Second', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'brilliant', 'director', 'can', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'just', 'stepped', 'time', 'machine', 'gone', 'back', 'visit', '60', 'how', 'authentic', 'setting', 'movie.However', 'problem', 'sometimes', 'have', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'tendancy', 'go', 'little', 'overboard', 'films', 'Doors', 'perfect', 'example', 'know', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'was', 'troubled', 'soul', 'hey', 'let', 'face', 'most', 'artistic', 'geniuses', 'are', 'what', 'work', 'so', 'incredible', 'Stone', 'however', 'made', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'be', 'acid-draining', 'Nazi', 'cared', 'only', 'had', 'violent', 'outbursts', 'time', 'reality', 'though', 'one', 'little', 'research', 'one', 'out', 'Jim', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'not', 'second', 'life', 'movie', 'felt', 'failed', 'show', 'more', 'beautiful', 'maverick', 'poet/shaman', 'Jim', 'most', 'time', 'really', 'was.Also', 'felt', 'sex', 'angle', 'was', 'overplayed', 'bit', 'as', 'well', 'Obviously', 'Jim', 'had', 'slept', 'number', 'women', 'women', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'most', 'likely', 'fantasized', 'being', 'Jim', 'However', 'was', 'film', 'made', 'Jim', 'be', 'so', 'horny', 'would', 'actually', 'have', 'sex', 'mannequins', 'local', 'department', 'store.In', 'reality', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'only', 'real', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'was', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'Stone', 'accurate', 're-creation', 'trippin', 'sixties']",N/A

I'm hot and cold on the excesses of Oliver Stone's film style, but it seemed to work in this case.  I don't know what is truth and what is fiction, but the style of the film blended into the music made for an entertaining experience.  In many ways the movie opened up their lesser-known songs to my enjoyment and the performances in the film are excellent.  Being somewhat tired of Meg Ryan's Romantic Comedy per year output, it was nice seeing what might happen to such a sweet girl in the throes of the 60s, Rock music and the decadent scene.  You also have to wonder why Val Kilmer wasn't nominated for an Oscar after his great performance.  What's interesting about hippie movies is that film makers inevitably identify with this period and have to contain themselves not to romanticize it, but I still come away glad that I wasn't a part of it.As for the Special Edition DVD, Oliver Stone provides insightful commentary about the making of the film and the meeting of Jim's and Pam's parents.  He points out and explains the symbolism of the Shaman and death and all of the things that seem in your face on first viewing.

74304,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,0784010528,Joker,"[2, 3]","It's hard to believe that The Doors (1991) is now twenty years old.  It's also hard to believe Jim Morrison has been gone 40 years already.  Time flies.  This movie was made by the always controversial Oliver Stone.  This movie basically centers around the wild lifestyle of lead singer Jim Morrison.Val Kilmer gives a great performance as Jim Morrison.  I don't think any other actor could have done better.  Kyle MacLachlan is also great as keyboardist Ray Manzarek.  Frank Whaley does well as guitarist Robbie Krieger, and Kevin Dillon does a good job as drummer John Densmore.  Meg Ryan is a good Pamela Courson (Morrison's girlfriend).  Kathleen Quinlan is great as Patricia Kennealy (Morrison's mistress).  Look for cameo appearances by Paul Rothschild (the band's producer) and John Densmore.  Also look for Billy Idol, who plays Cat.A lot of things that occur in this movie either never happened, or if they did, were greatly exaggerated.  Keyboardist Ray Manzarek has been quoted many times as saying that certain incidents in the movie never happened, such as the Thanksgiving scene, the exaggerated performance of Light My Fire on The Ed Sullivan Show, etc.  There are also some factual errors in the movie.One thing I don't like about this movie is the fact that Oliver Stone portrayed Jim Morrison as a self-centered out of control drunk.  He exaggerated everything, which is typical of Stone.  I've read lots of books on Morrison and The Doors going back to the early 1980s and watched many videos/documentaries.  Morrison had a sense of humor that was absent in the movie.  He was very cerebral as well.  He wasn't wild ALL the time, but he was a great deal of the time.  Early in the movie all four band members vow to stick together, support each other no matter what, and do everything unanimously, but as the movie progresses, Manzarek, Densmore, and Krieger increasingly turn against Morrison as Morrison's behavior gets more and more out of control.  I found this interesting but understandable, because when one of the band members is totally out of control, the band can't do everything unanimously and without conflict.  This is the result of Oliver Stone choosing to portray Morrison as TOTALLY out of control.  Stone should have taken the middle road when portraying Morrison, wild but not TOO wild, but his goal is to entertain the movie audience by exaggerating things.I saw Ray Manzarek perform live, by himself, at Pine Knob Music Theater in Clarkston, MI in July 2002.

Stone even uses a Steadicam at various points, for Pete's sake.  The results are ugly, to be frank.But forget all that; that's technical stuff, and may be overlooked as long as the subject matter is worth watching.  I'm afraid that Stone failed to make his case, here.  The question before the Court is:  &quot;Was a movie about Jim Morrison entirely necessary?&quot;  This movie, as evidence, would fail to convict.  Stone is preaching to a converted audience, presumably; an audience that knows all the ins and outs of the rock star's career, and he  (Stone)  expects us to fill in the blanks.  Hey, all I knew for sure about the guy is that he sang a song called  *Light My Fire*  in which he sounded rather like a Sinatra gone literally to pot.  The other reviwers here at Amazon assure me that Morrison was a serious Poet; that he was fearsomely well-read; that he should be regarded as an artist.  Well, in the first place, if he had been a REAL artist, he would now be recognized as such by critics -- so far, that notice has failed to occur.  Secondly, *The Doors*  does nothing to prove Morrison's artistic cred.  At any rate, we're offered a series of tawdry scenes where a celebrity behaves like . . . well, a celebrity.

The movie starts off well enough with Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison in a recording studio reading his poetry (""Did you have a good world when you died? Enough to base a movie on?"") Then flashes back to Morrison's childhood when he witnessed an accident in the New Mexico desert in which some Indians had been in a car accident and the young Jim Morrison felt as if the soul of one of those Indians leapt into his. Then we pick up Morrison as leaves the UCLA film school to self imposed exile on a Venice Beach rooftop where it's inferred that Morrison was writing. He meets Pam Courson (Meg Ryan) and bumps into former UCLA classmate Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan) who asks Morrison what he's been doing, Morrison answers writing songs, and Manzarek asks him to sing one. Jim sings Moonlight Drive and Ray says they should start a rock band and make a million dollars.The movie closely follows the highlights of The Doors/Morrison's career from playing The Whisky a go-go where the Oedipal section of The End was first heard and got them fired only to be picked up by Elektra Records, to playing the Ed Sullivan Show and being asked by producers to excise the word higher in Light My Fire, Morrison refused, the New Haven concert where Morrison became the first rock star arrested on stage, Miami, his obscenity trial, his Wiccan wedding with Patricia Keneally (Kathleen Quinlan) and one unintentionally hilarious scene where Jim and Pam get into an argument and Jim stomps a duck. There are a lot of cameos in the movie including Doors drummer John Densmore, Billy Idol, Eric Burdon, Paul Williams, and Doors producer Paul Rothchild.The acting is good, although Michael Madsen seems wasted in such a small part of Tom Baker, a friend of Morrison's. Oliver Stone gets most of the facts right, and gives a good feel for the 60's and the music. What he doesn't get right is pretty major. Besides directing Stone also gets a credit as screenwriter, but when he runs out of things for Morrison to say he just inserts Doors lyrics, as if Morrison was running around quoting songs all the time. The movie also tends to only portray the sensationalistic side of Morrison's personality, and while I understand film is an active medium there is one scene missing, a scene which shows Morrison sitting and writing the songs.I gave one of the rating stars to the bonus features and this DVD is crammed with bonus features, deleted scenes, commentary, and the rarely seen English documentary The Doors Are Open which was shot on The Doors first European tour in 68.The Doors movie by Oliver Stone may be part of a 60's trilogy. Each third represents a different aspect of the 60's.Platoon-The Vietnam experience.JFK- About the political atmosphere of the 60's and how we lost faith in our leaders because of an alleged conspiracy.And finally The Doors. To illustrate the counter culture experience of the 60's. This movie & JFK have both recieved reviews panning them due to not sticking with the facts. But these 2 movies are also outside of Stone's range of experience so it might have been a little harder for him to internalize the experience and present them to their best effect.",4,End of Stone's 60's Trilogy,1235865600,"03 1, 2009",2009,3476,"['fans', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Janis', 'Joplin', 'wait', 'endlessly', 'film', 'bios', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'hero', 'Doors', 'fans', 'have', 'long', 'had', 'bio-pic', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'courtesy', 'Oliver', 'Stone.I', 'gave', 'review', 'four', 'stars', 'movie', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'fourth', 'star', 'bonus', 'features', 'movie', 'off', 'well', 'enough', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'recording', 'studio', 'reading', 'poetry', 'Did', 'have', 'good', 'world', 'when', 'died', 'Enough', 'base', 'movie', 'Then', 'back', 'Morrison', 'childhood', 'when', 'witnessed', 'accident', 'New', 'Mexico', 'desert', 'Indians', 'had', 'been', 'car', 'accident', 'young', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'felt', 'soul', 'one', 'Indians', 'leapt', 'Then', 'pick', 'up', 'Morrison', 'UCLA', 'film', 'school', 'self', 'imposed', 'exile', 'Venice', 'Beach', 'rooftop', 'where', 'inferred', 'Morrison', 'was', 'writing', 'Pam', 'Courson', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'former', 'UCLA', 'classmate', 'Ray', 'Manzarek', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan', 'who', 'Morrison', 'what', 'been', 'doing', 'Morrison', 'writing', 'songs', 'Manzarek', 'sing', 'one', 'Jim', 'sings', 'Moonlight', 'Drive', 'Ray', 'should', 'start', 'rock', 'band', 'make', 'million', 'dollars.The', 'movie', 'closely', 'highlights', 'Doors/Morrison', 'career', 'playing', 'Whisky', 'go-go', 'where', 'Oedipal', 'section', 'End', 'was', 'first', 'heard', 'got', 'fired', 'only', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'Elektra', 'Records', 'playing', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Show', 'being', 'asked', 'producers', 'excise', 'word', 'higher', 'Light', 'My', 'Fire', 'Morrison', 'refused', 'New', 'Haven', 'concert', 'where', 'Morrison', 'became', 'first', 'rock', 'star', 'arrested', 'stage', 'Miami', 'obscenity', 'trial', 'Wiccan', 'wedding', 'Patricia', 'Keneally', 'Kathleen', 'Quinlan', 'one', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'scene', 'where', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'get', 'argument', 'Jim', 'stomps', 'duck', 'are', 'lot', 'cameos', 'movie', 'including', 'Doors', 'drummer', 'John', 'Densmore', 'Billy', 'Idol', 'Eric', 'Burdon', 'Paul', 'Williams', 'Doors', 'producer', 'Paul', 'Rothchild.The', 'acting', 'good', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'wasted', 'such', 'small', 'part', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'friend', 'Morrison', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'most', 'facts', 'right', 'good', 'feel', '60', 'music', 'What', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'pretty', 'major', 'directing', 'Stone', 'also', 'credit', 'screenwriter', 'when', 'things', 'Morrison', 'say', 'just', 'Doors', 'lyrics', 'Morrison', 'was', 'running', 'around', 'quoting', 'songs', 'time', 'movie', 'also', 'only', 'portray', 'sensationalistic', 'side', 'Morrison', 'personality', 'understand', 'film', 'active', 'medium', 'one', 'scene', 'missing', 'scene', 'Morrison', 'sitting', 'writing', 'songs.I', 'gave', 'one', 'rating', 'stars', 'bonus', 'features', 'DVD', 'crammed', 'bonus', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'rarely', 'seen', 'English', 'documentary', 'Doors', 'Are', 'Open', 'was', 'shot', 'Doors', 'first', 'European', 'tour', '68.The', 'Doors', 'movie', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'may', 'be', 'part', '60', 'trilogy', 'third', 'different', 'aspect', ""60's.Platoon-The"", 'Vietnam', 'experience.JFK-', 'political', 'atmosphere', '60', 'how', 'lost', 'faith', 'leaders', 'alleged', 'conspiracy.And', 'finally', 'Doors', 'illustrate', 'counter', 'culture', 'experience', '60', 'movie', 'JFK', 'have', 'recieved', 'reviews', 'panning', 'due', 'not', 'sticking', 'facts', '2', 'movies', 'are', 'also', 'Stone', 'range', 'experience', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'harder', 'internalize', 'experience', 'present', 'best', 'effect']",N/A

From the opening monologue over the shadowy desert to the psychedelic highs of ""Light My Fire"" to the down and out, bloated and bearded Morrison of ""Riders On The Storm"" to the predictable outcome in Paris, Stone's amazing directorial talents shine and truly make this a film to experience, not just view.Stone's on-the-edge style was tailor-made for a band that challenged it's listeners to ""Break On Through"".  The soundtrack rules, with a plethora of The Doors' classics (the underappreciated ""Roadhouse Blues"" among them), a little help from The Velvet Underground, some classical thrown in for good measure and Morrison's poetry (performed by Morrison).There is a great cameo by Paul Rothchild, the band's producer and bit parts for Billy Idol, Bill Graham and Crispen Glover (as Andy Warhol and as creepy as ever).  The great Michael Madsen and Kathleen Quinlan (who plays a would-be witch and dances naked - worth the price of admission right there!) also shine.But, again, it is Stone that makes this movie roll.  Does he lean too heavily on Morrison's dark side and over emphasize the wild side of his personality (Morrison also is said to have had a sweet, low key and compassionate side)?  Probably, but factual accuracy has never been Stone's forte' (reference ""JFK"").  But a rock group's daily comings and goings are not the stuff that crumbles nations and Stone can be forgiven here.

It's not surprising that Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek found this film so objectionable.  How would you feel if thousands of people were seeing a movie about you that was mostly untrue, and cast you in a bad light?Still, as long as you accept that this is a dramatization of how one person perceives the Doors and their music, this is an enjoyable film, made worthwhile especially by Val Kilmer's uncanny impersonation of Jim Morrison.  Stone's quasi-surrealistic approach evokes the time and place and seems particularly well suited to the inner world of Doors music.A major objection is the emphasis on Morrison as a drunken, obnoxious lout.  This side of Morrison is an easy target for a film maker, but it's hardly an accurate portrayal.  I strongly recommend The Doors Collection DVD, which will give you a glimpse of Morrison's sensitive side.  Also Manzarek's memoir &quot;Light My Fire&quot; will balance the picture for you.Although the listing here says that this is an anamorphic transfer, according to information on other web sites this is NOT ANAMORPHIC, but is the same transfer used in the previous DVD release (and the laserdisc).  It's nice to have the extras, but early reviews indicate that this is a particularly low quality transfer, and I'd prefer to hold out for a new anamorphic release.

Not for the story but I am unsure where Oliver Stone was coming from with this take on the life and death of Jim Morrison. Did Stone have an axe to grind? It seemed that way. I have read several books and watched footage of him as well as interviews with those closest to him. Yes, Morrison did have issues with alcohol that at times rendered him ( I am sure) unbearable and obnoxious but it seems this is all we ever see. The character is very one dimensional. Val Kilmer has the look and feel of Morrison down pat. Unfortunately, he had to follow Stone's portrayal which is where the problem is. There was another side that Stone neglects entirely. Morrison in interviews tended to be very soft spoken, shy. We never see this side as it is thrown aside to have the arrogant Morrison 24/7 stoned and /or drunk staggering around spouting lines from songs that were still unwritten and at times written by other band members. Morrison was a talented poet and troubled person with his own demons; however we never get to see this in favor of flamboyant and at times inaccurate depictions.There are some pros to this movie. Some of the cinematography is beautiful, and Kilmer did a great job of sounding like the real Jim Morrison. The music and the feel is pure 60's heaven.

74323,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,0784010528,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[1, 5]","The Doors - directed by Oliver Stone -  is a sad story about the 60's rock group and legend Jim Morrison, lead singer, poet and songwriter.  The movie covers the period from 1965-1971.  Val Kilmer stars as Jim Morrison, a very intelligent man who is his own worst enemy.  He cannot handle the pressures of success.  We see a slow train wreck as he turns to excesses in drugs, drink, women and exhibitionism.In the beginning (1965) he is going to college, but also a Southern California beach boy, writing poetry, finding his first true love.  It could be the start of Beach Blanket Bingo for that matter.  A friend helps Jim form the Doors rock group (named after the book by Aldus Huxley ""The Doors of Perception"")  and from there on it is a marathion of drugs, drink, egotism, confusion and despair.  Depending on how much you enjoy the 1960's counterculture will be how you view this movie.  It hypnotizes in the treadmill of drug trips, crazy outfits, California, trendy clubs, Andy Warhol parties, and outrageous behavior.As fabulous as Val Kilmer plays Jim Morrison, the drugged, halucinagenic excess becomes boring fast.  The opporutnity lost is that Morrison had talent with words, high intelligence, but spent it on the dark side.  Seeing this movie I am wondering if he could have been pulled from the abyss with better handlers and some on-going therapy. Morrison died in Paris at the young age of 27 and is buried in a near-by cemetery for famous artists.  Overall, the movie seemed like a long tabloid expose and I felt like this was an intrusion on the Morrison's privacy.It also starred Meg Ryan (as Morrison's girlfriend), and the Doors group played by Frank Whaley, Kyle MacLachlan",2,"Drugs, Depression, Opportunity Lost",1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,1698,"['Doors', 'directed', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'sad', 'story', '60', 'rock', 'group', 'legend', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'lead', 'singer', 'poet', 'songwriter', 'movie', 'period', '1965-1971', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'stars', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'very', 'intelligent', 'man', 'who', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'pressures', 'success', 'see', 'slow', 'train', 'wreck', 'excesses', 'drugs', 'drink', 'women', 'exhibitionism.In', 'beginning', '1965', 'going', 'college', 'also', 'Southern', 'California', 'beach', 'boy', 'writing', 'poetry', 'finding', 'first', 'true', 'love', 'could', 'be', 'start', 'Beach', 'Blanket', 'Bingo', 'matter', 'friend', 'Jim', 'form', 'Doors', 'rock', 'group', 'named', 'book', 'Aldus', 'Huxley', 'Doors', 'Perception', 'there', 'marathion', 'drugs', 'drink', 'egotism', 'confusion', 'despair', 'Depending', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', '1960', 'counterculture', 'will', 'be', 'how', 'view', 'movie', 'treadmill', 'drug', 'trips', 'crazy', 'outfits', 'California', 'trendy', 'clubs', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'parties', 'outrageous', 'behavior.As', 'fabulous', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'drugged', 'halucinagenic', 'excess', 'boring', 'fast', 'opporutnity', 'lost', 'Morrison', 'had', 'talent', 'words', 'high', 'intelligence', 'spent', 'dark', 'side', 'Seeing', 'movie', 'am', 'wondering', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pulled', 'abyss', 'better', 'handlers', 'on-going', 'therapy', 'Morrison', 'died', 'Paris', 'young', 'age', '27', 'buried', 'near-by', 'cemetery', 'famous', 'artists', 'Overall', 'movie', 'seemed', 'long', 'tabloid', 'expose', 'felt', 'was', 'intrusion', 'Morrison', 'privacy.It', 'also', 'starred', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Morrison', 'girlfriend', 'Doors', 'group', 'played', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 'Kyle', 'MacLachlan']",N/A

74326,A3KDC5EZSA8AZJ,0784010528,"Menachem Rephun ""Billy Sluthers McShea""","[2, 7]","If one word had to be used to describe Oliver Stone's rambling, chaotic, yet somehow peculiarly mesmerizing tribute to 1970's rock n' roll icon and ""Doors"" frontman Jim Morrison, it would have to be ""disorienting"".Morrison's short life, if Stone's account is to be trusted, was a confused and hedonistic mess, a fact belied by the movie's lurching and delirious structure, which, in short, makes one's head spin unpleasantly and induces a sick, queasy feeling in the pit of one's stomach, a sensation which increases steadily as the film progresses and Morrison's biography becomes harder and harder to follow. The atmosphere of the 1960s and '70s, though, is vividly evoked, with lilting shots of colorfully costumed hippies, artists, and various eccentric loafers. The implication, however, is that these people, particularly the rebellious Morrison and his ilk, were ""stoned"" out of their gourds the entire time, thereby rendering their career and accomplishments meaningless (the lines between fiction and reality, for example, become inextricably blurred in one laughably excessive sequence in which Morrison & co. sit in the middle of an imaginary desert getting high on Acid, in the proccess coming up with the remarkable lyrics to ""The End"". I am an admirer of ""The Doors"" music, and would like to think there was a deeper significance to that song than some random ""trip"" Morrison took one day in mid 1964, or thereabouts).Yet there are nevertheless exciting moments in this flawed feature, such as when Morrison defies the censorship of a couple of ""square"" music producers by refusing to alter the lyrics to one of the band's songs. The acting is generally without fault: Val Kilmer's performace captures to a T the confused wildness of Morrison's personality, his rebellious stance and desire to be seen as a poet (early scenes reveal subtly the influence of Arthur Rimbaud and Antonin Artaud). The last scene of the movie shows the subject's gravesite in France, making the point that he is more revered and remembered than a host of intellectuals and artists who preceded him (including, among their ranks, Marcel Proust, Oscar Wilde, Moliere, Chopin and others). Whether or not Morrison is deserving of such prestige is a question the film leaves unanswered (though there are numerous implications toward the contrary), and it is one which the viewer will ultimately have to answer himself.",2,"too ""trippin'""",1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,2405,"['one', 'word', 'had', 'be', 'used', 'describe', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'rambling', 'chaotic', 'yet', 'somehow', 'peculiarly', 'mesmerizing', 'tribute', '1970', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'icon', 'Doors', 'frontman', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'disorienting', '.Morrison', 'short', 'life', 'Stone', 'account', 'be', 'trusted', 'was', 'confused', 'hedonistic', 'mess', 'fact', 'belied', 'movie', 'lurching', 'delirious', 'structure', 'short', 'one', 'head', 'spin', 'unpleasantly', 'sick', 'queasy', 'feeling', 'pit', 'one', 'stomach', 'sensation', 'steadily', 'film', 'progresses', 'Morrison', 'biography', 'harder', 'harder', 'follow', 'atmosphere', '1960s', ""'70s"", 'though', 'vividly', 'evoked', 'lilting', 'shots', 'colorfully', 'costumed', 'hippies', 'artists', 'various', 'eccentric', 'loafers', 'implication', 'however', 'people', 'particularly', 'rebellious', 'Morrison', 'ilk', 'were', 'stoned', 'gourds', 'entire', 'time', 'thereby', 'rendering', 'career', 'accomplishments', 'meaningless', 'lines', 'fiction', 'reality', 'example', 'become', 'inextricably', 'blurred', 'one', 'laughably', 'excessive', 'sequence', 'Morrison', 'co.', 'sit', 'middle', 'imaginary', 'desert', 'getting', 'high', 'Acid', 'proccess', 'coming', 'up', 'remarkable', 'lyrics', 'End', 'am', 'admirer', 'Doors', 'music', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'was', 'deeper', 'significance', 'song', 'random', 'trip', 'Morrison', 'took', 'one', 'day', 'mid', '1964', 'thereabouts', '.Yet', 'are', 'nevertheless', 'exciting', 'moments', 'flawed', 'feature', 'such', 'when', 'Morrison', 'censorship', 'couple', 'square', 'music', 'producers', 'refusing', 'alter', 'lyrics', 'one', 'band', 'songs', 'acting', 'generally', 'fault', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'performace', 'T', 'confused', 'wildness', 'Morrison', 'personality', 'rebellious', 'stance', 'desire', 'be', 'seen', 'poet', 'early', 'scenes', 'reveal', 'subtly', 'influence', 'Arthur', 'Rimbaud', 'Antonin', 'Artaud', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'subject', 'gravesite', 'France', 'making', 'point', 'more', 'revered', 'remembered', 'host', 'intellectuals', 'artists', 'who', 'preceded', 'including', 'ranks', 'Marcel', 'Proust', 'Oscar', 'Wilde', 'Moliere', 'Chopin', 'others', 'not', 'Morrison', 'deserving', 'such', 'prestige', 'question', 'film', 'unanswered', 'are', 'numerous', 'implications', 'contrary', 'one', 'viewer', 'will', 'ultimately', 'have', 'answer']",N/A

He was more concerned with having fun and being a spacey poet lauriet, even if it was in his own mind.  Here he would meet his love, Pamela, and get together with three friends to form The Doors.  From there, it was all a heady haze of success, fame and self indulgence.  While the other Doors took drugs with him to expand their minds and satisfy their own curiousities, Jim dove head first into full blown addiction.  From there his life would turn into a haze of drug induced behavior, arrests, and lashing out at others.I was glad that this movie made some signifigant points in the history of The Doors.  It was Robby the guitar player, not Jim, who wrote Light My Fire.  They made an historic appearence on the Ed Sullivan Show that outraged the network brass for saying ""higher"" on their show rather than their censored rewrites.  And there was that infamous show in Miami that turned into an outright embarrassment where he whiped it out and showed us the Ivory White Shaft.  It's not so big a deal nowdays, but back then it was shocking and offensive unlike anyone had ever done.  And Val Kilmer was a dead ringer for the real Jim!What prevented me from giving this 5 stars was the fact that they embellished many things and fabricated many things.  This Jim was really, really rude and unlikable, and I doubt even at his most obnoxiously drunk / high moment he would act so vain and self centered at all times.  That scene where he meets Nico from The Velvet Underground was not true according to many others.  His relationship with the pagan girfriend was left unresolved (although that is her in the pagan wedding scene between him and Kathleen Quinlan), when in real life she would end up aborting his child.  Even his strained relationship with the other Doors was left up in the air once he left for France.  And I have met enough people who really went to Doors concerts back in the day, and they were not really these huge naked drug orgies like they were portrayed in the movie.Still, this was a good movie.

74336,A10X0JN8KTK89H,0784010528,ninjasuperstar,"[2, 4]","Some reviewers seem annoyed that the film is actually about Jim Morrison and not about The Doors.  And it's true.  The band seems like a canvas upon which Jim Morrison can sing, act out, drink, and otherwise remain perpetually painted at the forefront of this film.  Oliver Stone's camera is enamored with Val Kilmer's Jim Morrison.  And Kilmer's performance is quite exciting, indeed.  But I wonder why Stone lets Kilmer steal the entire movie.  Where are The Doors?  Where's the history of the band?  The movie suggests that The Doors revolve entirely around Morrison and that the stories of the other band members, while likely less crazy and sensational, are not at all interesting without Morrison's presence and influence.I think the tragedy of Jim Morrison's life is that he actually believed that drugs, sex, and alcohol - mixed with a soul trapped by societal conventions - somehow opens the artist to the infinite beauty of the universe.  But really, it's pain that drives all good art.  Morrison writes, speaks, and sings of his poor relationship with his parents.  He sought the convention of a happy family by desensitizing himself rather than facing his fear of utter abandonment honestly and soberly.  It's this pain that makes Morrison somewhat sympathetic.

Oh sure, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore contributed to the music and the sound, no doubt, but without Morrison the Doors would have been a long forgotten L.A. band.  Or do you rate ""Other Voices"" and ""Full Circle"" as classics?  Yeah, I didn't think so.Now that we have that settled, this imperfect movie rates the 5 on the relatively soft Amazon scale for one huge reason, the spot-on near clone performance of Val Kilmer, surely the role of his life so far.  I can recall few, if any, portrayals that are a closer match to the real person.  The face, the expressions, the movements and that voice . . . wow.  The scene in the Whiskey, fading in through the indian's eye, it's one of the best things put on film, ever.  The movie isn't great, it moves too fast and leaves a lot out, but there are great things in it.I also liked the way the movie paid homage to the Morrison mythos too; was he really possessed?  Did they raise Dionysus in concert?  Could he really recite from memory obscure books found only in the library of Congress?  Well, maybe not, but there was something spiritual about Morrison, the man was one of those ""great souls"" whose personality dominated all around him.  He had a certain amount of art in him, all written in his poetry book before they even started, and when it was done, he was done, and he was gone, probably still wearing the same shoes and pants.  His life, though tragic, was pure rock and roll.  Everyone dies.  Morrison lived like a skyrocket.  The movie is a fitting tribute, with no holds barred.By the way, the original version of this movie carried one last line of print before the credits, in case you're curious.

I had the pleasure of first watching this film after taken over 100 dried psilocybin mushrooms and even though I would not do that again as quickly, I must say that this film was an excellent choice at the time.Basically the story is that there is none expect for the rise and fall of the music legend Jim Morrison. The film starts with his boyhood memories of an Indian car accident, his early film-school days (watch for the cameo of Oliver Stone as his film professor) and the formation of the band  - The Doors, which consists of the actors Kyle Maclachlan, Kevin Dillion and Frank Whaley. Val Kilmer IS Jim Morrison and is completely believable throughout the entire film. The plot revolves around his relationship with Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan) who battles for his love and attention as Morrison takes on a God like status in the world of sex, drugs and rock n' roll.Stone decides to concentrate more on Morrison's descent into self-destruction and there are plenty of tragic gigs gone wrong along the way. The film is very mystical in parts but ends up saying very little. It is more about the ups and downs (mostly downs) of a big time rock n' roll star than anything else. Wonderful camerawork though and amazing lighting.

That is a cliche', but when you think of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Mama ""Cass"" Elliot and Jim Morrison, there is truth in that wisdom as you look back upon the late 60's and 70's music genre.  This film, a classic by Oliver Stone and what should have been an Academy Award winning performance for Val Kilmer, is a revival of one of the most remarkable rock musicians of all time - Jim Morrison... Morrision was a charismatic wizard of rock...and mesmerized his audiences not only with music...but with his poetic talents and mastery of the English language.  Yes...Morrison defined his life with the statement - ""I am the Lizard King...I can do anything"" - and this film captures the essence of that statement.  Val Kilmer was perfectly cast in this film.  He was either kin to Morrison or found a piece of his soul when trying to emulate the influence JM had on the youth of the Sixties.  I'd give this film a rating of ""6"" if it were within the rating scale.  Meg Ryan is so convincing, I asked my friends if she ever had a romantic relationship with Val Kilmer outside of this film.  No one knew.  And the soundtrack (of course) is awesome.  If I had led such a tragic life as JM...and had wallowed in the mire (no pun intended) with alcohol and drugs like he...I would have been honored to have such a film pay a tribute to my life.

I also think that no one else will ever possess the presence or talent that Jim Morrison did,especially with the way rock ""music"" is going these days (I mean, Limp Bizkit was popular a few years ago, if that says anything about where rock is headed.)I'm not an Oliver Stone fan particularly. I've never seen JFK, and Natural Born Killers seems to have a sort of following behind it, but I honestly didn't see any redeeming qualities about that movie. So when I saw that Oliver Stone was the director of the movie about my favorite band, although I was excited to watch it, I truthfully wasn't expecting very much.I bought it before watching it and still own it. Although I've seen it many times, I'm still conflicted as to how I feel about it. It seems that the movie, although true to The Doors and how they got together and their rise to fame, did not do Jim justice at all. It had nothing to do with Val Kilmer, he was perfect as Jim, especially the live performance scenes; I've watched many Doors live performances and how Val embodied Jim in that respect was really amazing. I do think he over-did it sometimes-the pouty thing he did drove me nuts and the photo shoot scene made me laugh it was so cheesy. All in all though, I loved Val as Jim. Yet the movie seemed to show only one aspect of who Morrison was-on the road to excess, out of control, drunken, womanizing. Sure he's a rock star, but I would have loved to know more about who he REALLY was, because I feel the movie didn't delve into that. I'm positive there was much more to him than the drunken rock star (even if it was the truth, that's not all of who he was). Ray Manzarek said it best ""It was not about Jim Morrison. It was about Jimbo Morrison, the drunk. God, where was the sensitive poet and the funny guy? The guy I knew was not on that screen.""I give the movie three stars because aside from my criticisms of it, it's essentially a good movie by an okay director about an amazing band.

And even a photographer tells Jim that its all about him, that everyone just loves him, that hes the doors.So its not like the movie is decieved and lieing to us, its just showing the more so the MYTH that was Morrison...not the man, who is far more interesting to me than the whats shown in this film.This movie didnt ruin or spoil my outlook on the band or Jim Morrison.Ive grown up hearing and respecting the doors and know what very well done music theyve produced besides radio hits, so my appreciation isnt clouded by this little film.I think its fun to watch. I dont know if i will ever watch it again, but it just makes me wanna delve into who Jim really was and into The Doors music even more, cuz i know they were far more than this mere movie, which still pays ok tribute to the band and the singer.This movie still doesnt quench a thirst or curb my appetite for learning more about the Doors and Morrison, its more like a little appetiser, if anything.I wouldnt watch this movie as if it were a documentary...it needs to be taken with a grain of salt.

But for a hollywood movie, what do you expect...they still did a good job keeping it entertaining for mass appeal and creating a cool little tribute to the man and band.Again, this is not the best example of learning or appreciating The Doors, let alone their singer...but its kinda fun and interesting.",3,"Movie was kinda fun and interesting, but...",1186531200,"08 8, 2007",2007,3091,"['still', 'just', 'movie', 'i', 'dont', 'feel', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'accuratly', 'deep', 'enuff', 'side', 'most', 'people', 'percieve', 'i', 'think', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'fun', 'really', 'wan', 'na', 'know', 'band', 'get', 'albums', 'read', 'jims', 'poetry', 'maybe', 'find', 'good', 'biography', 'book', 'him.This', 'movie', 'been', 'critised', 'here', 'being', 'more', 'Jim', 'rest', 'band', 'whole', 'thats', 'becouse', 'again', 'portraying', 'casual', 'listeners', 'perception', 'band', 'only', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'cuz', 'sexy', 'music', 'was', 'cool', '.and', 'other', 'guys', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'band', '.and', 'movie', 'conscious', 'scenes', 'where', 'people', 'try', 'exploit', 'Jim', 'tell', 'lose', 'other', 'guys', 'even', 'photographer', 'Jim', 'everyone', 'just', 'doors.So', 'not', 'movie', 'decieved', 'lieing', 'just', 'showing', 'more', 'so', 'MYTH', 'was', 'Morrison', 'not', 'man', 'who', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'whats', 'shown', 'film.This', 'movie', 'didnt', 'ruin', 'spoil', 'outlook', 'band', 'Jim', 'Morrison.Ive', 'grown', 'up', 'hearing', 'respecting', 'doors', 'know', 'what', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'music', 'theyve', 'produced', 'radio', 'hits', 'appreciation', 'isnt', 'clouded', 'little', 'film.I', 'think', 'fun', 'watch', 'dont', 'know', 'i', 'will', 'ever', 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'wan', 'delve', 'who', 'Jim', 'really', 'was', 'Doors', 'music', 'even', 'more', 'cuz', 'i', 'know', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'mere', 'movie', 'still', 'ok', 'tribute', 'band', 'singer.This', 'movie', 'still', 'quench', 'thirst', 'curb', 'appetite', 'learning', 'more', 'Doors', 'Morrison', 'more', 'little', 'appetiser', 'anything.I', 'wouldnt', 'watch', 'movie', 'were', 'documentary', 'be', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt', 'possiably', 'sum', 'up', 'what', 'Doors', 'were', 'band', 'who', 'Jim', 'was', 'man.Again', 'fun', 'portraying', 'MYTH', 'not', 'man', 'should', 'i', 'say', 'men', 'Cuz', 'guys', 'band', 'made', 'movie', 'possiable', 'Jim', 'alone', 'wouldnt', 'amounted', 'anything', 'i', 'dont', 'think', 'other', 'gifted', 'musicians', 'was', 'privied', 'have', 'met.I', 'how', 'ya', 'get', 'see', 'Jim', 'first', 'starting', 'out', 'meeting', 'future', 'girlfriend', 'Pam', 'future', 'band', 'mates', 'nothing', 'deep', 'how', 'kinda', 'interesting.Its', 'more', 'so', 'movie', 'casual', 'listeners', 'Doors', 'fans', 'just', 'na', 'take', 'pretend', 'look', 'how', 'might', 'been', 'life', 'Jim', 'other', 'Doors', 'members', 'just', 'see', 'story', 'come', 'life', 'way.Val', 'Kilmer', 'decent', 'job', 'playing', 'Jim', 'i', 'think', 'only', 'mythic', 'rock', 'God', 'thing', 'i', 'wish', 'movie', 'showed', 'more', 'comtemplative', 'thoughtfull', 'side', 'surface', 'i', 'think', 'hollywood', 'movie', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'still', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'entertaining', 'mass', 'appeal', 'creating', 'cool', 'little', 'tribute', 'man', 'band.Again', 'not', 'best', 'example', 'learning', 'appreciating', 'Doors', 'let', 'alone', 'singer', 'kinda', 'fun', 'interesting']",N/A

A more appropriate title might have been ""Morrison"" or, ""Jim Morrison and the Decadence.""The film doesn't give any insight into the band, its formation, or its creative process.  Instead, with respect to the band, we get many all-too-brief scenes--often with improbable dialogue.  For example, early on, we see The Doors rehearsing, playing ""Break on Through,"" when, inexplicitly, John Densmore stops playing to say it's not happening for him.  So then Robbie Krieger, on cue, pulls a scrap of paper out of his pocket and says he has a song (Light My Fire).  He sings a verse.  Morrison, on first listen says, ""These are great lyrics, do you have another verse?""  Another verse materializes.  The band plays less than a minute with Morrison singing. Then Ray Manzarek stops them all to say, ""Give me five minutes, I need (to write) an intro""-so the band goes out to the beach.  Of course then we're treated to the recorded intro to the song.  The whole scene is rather unbelievable.Later in the film, backstage in the throes of a concert, when Morrison is obviously high, Densmore criticizes his behavior, without any sort of conversational prelude, by telling him: ""We took drugs to expand our mind, not to escape.""The script could have been written by a high schooler from L.A.  The title to this review is one of the few good lines in the film.So, the film audience learns next to nothing about Krieger, Manzarek or Densmore except to know them as foils to Morrison and to perhaps infer they're all pretty square-never mind that the whole band wrote many of their great songs.By contrast, we learn all too much about Morrison-most of it unflattering.  Having enjoyed his music so much I might expect to find something to like about him as a person.  As portrayed, there's not much.  The film is all the time all about how bad and immature he can act.  For example, when Morrison's film at film school is criticized, he says, ""I quit"" and walks out.  Then he meets Pam (Meg Ryan) and tells her his parents are dead (a lie). As another reviewer here notes, Morrison is wasted throughout the movie.  We see him taking four or five acid trips and at least that many times he's drinking straight out of the bottle.  I'm amazed that someone whose apparent purpose in life was to either get wasted or get laid was able to concentrate on making good music.Val Kilmer did a good job acting, including his impression of Morrison's vocals.  As the film ends, however, you hear the real Morrison singing his incredible vocal on L.A. Woman and realize that Kilmer didn't quite get there-but then, who could?There are many cameos in ""The Doors"" including Densmore, Kreiger, Bonnie Bramlett, Paul Rothchild, Eric Burdon, Paul Williams, William Kuntsler and Patricia Keanally. Some were evident to this viewer; some were not.  But as intriguing as they might be, I'm not anxious to watch this film again anytime soon.",3,Where's your will to be weird?,1057622400,"07 8, 2003",2003,3426,"['really', 'music', 'Doors', 'had', 'many', 'fine', 'records', 'too', 'bad', 'film', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'same', 'standard.One', 'might', 'reasonably', 'expect', 'movie', 'named', 'quot', 'Doors', 'quot', 'be', 'band', 'name', 'reputation', 'not', 'One', 'might', 'further', 'expect', 'such', 'titled', 'film', 'be', 'focused', 'music', ""isn't.Instead"", 'quot', 'Doors', 'quot', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'film', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'singer', 'Doors', 'focus', 'rather', 'decadent', 'lifestyle', 'extent', 'film', 'accurate', 'more', 'appropriate', 'title', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Morrison', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Decadence', 'film', ""n't"", 'give', 'insight', 'band', 'formation', 'creative', 'process', 'Instead', 'respect', 'band', 'get', 'many', 'all-too-brief', 'scenes', 'often', 'improbable', 'dialogue', 'example', 'early', 'see', 'Doors', 'rehearsing', 'playing', 'Break', 'Through', 'when', 'inexplicitly', 'John', 'Densmore', 'playing', 'say', 'not', 'happening', 'So', 'then', 'Robbie', 'Krieger', 'cue', 'scrap', 'paper', 'pocket', 'song', 'Light', 'My', 'Fire', 'verse', 'Morrison', 'first', 'listen', 'are', 'great', 'lyrics', 'do', 'have', 'verse', 'verse', 'materializes', 'band', 'less', 'minute', 'Morrison', 'singing', 'Then', 'Ray', 'Manzarek', 'say', 'Give', 'five', 'minutes', 'need', 'write', 'intro', 'band', 'out', 'beach', 'course', 'then', ""'re"", 'treated', 'recorded', 'intro', 'song', 'whole', 'scene', 'rather', 'unbelievable.Later', 'film', 'backstage', 'throes', 'concert', 'when', 'Morrison', 'obviously', 'high', 'Densmore', 'behavior', 'sort', 'conversational', 'prelude', 'telling', 'took', 'drugs', 'expand', 'mind', 'not', 'escape', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'high', 'schooler', 'L.A', 'title', 'review', 'one', 'few', 'good', 'lines', 'film.So', 'film', 'audience', 'next', 'nothing', 'about', 'Krieger', 'Manzarek', 'Densmore', 'know', 'foils', 'Morrison', 'perhaps', 'infer', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'square-never', 'mind', 'whole', 'band', 'wrote', 'many', 'great', 'songs.By', 'contrast', 'learn', 'too', 'much', 'Morrison-most', 'unflattering', 'Having', 'enjoyed', 'music', 'so', 'much', 'might', 'expect', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'about', 'person', 'portrayed', 'not', 'much', 'film', 'time', 'how', 'bad', 'immature', 'can', 'act', 'example', 'when', 'Morrison', 'film', 'film', 'school', 'criticized', 'quit', 'out', 'Then', 'Pam', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'parents', 'are', 'dead', 'lie', 'reviewer', 'here', 'Morrison', 'wasted', 'movie', 'see', 'taking', 'four', 'five', 'acid', 'trips', 'least', 'many', 'times', 'drinking', 'straight', 'bottle', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'someone', 'apparent', 'purpose', 'life', 'was', 'get', 'wasted', 'get', 'laid', 'was', 'able', 'concentrate', 'making', 'good', 'music.Val', 'Kilmer', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'including', 'impression', 'Morrison', 'vocals', 'film', 'however', 'hear', 'real', 'Morrison', 'singing', 'incredible', 'vocal', 'L.A.', 'Woman', 'realize', 'Kilmer', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'there-but', 'then', 'who', 'could', 'are', 'many', 'cameos', 'Doors', 'including', 'Densmore', 'Kreiger', 'Bonnie', 'Bramlett', 'Paul', 'Rothchild', 'Eric', 'Burdon', 'Paul', 'Williams', 'William', 'Kuntsler', 'Patricia', 'Keanally', 'were', 'evident', 'viewer', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'intriguing', 'might', 'be', ""'m"", 'not', 'anxious', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'anytime', 'soon']",N/A

The film is directed by cinema madman and virtuoso, Oliver Stone, who was a Doors fan when serving in Vietnam and here conceives a movie that is big in scope and excess, in other words, it stays true to the spirit of it's subject. People (including Doors organist Ray Manzarek) have attacked Stone and movie for dramatic license and fictional inventions, but the Morrison myth has grown so large that it is hard to even trust the accounts of people like Manzarek (who enjoys pouring gasoline into the myth's fire) and so the movie should be taken for what it is, a MOVIE. And man, it is one of the great rock spectacles ever dramatized on film. Val Kilmer gives his greatest performance, dressed in the black leather pants and long hair, he gives a stunning performance because we never doubt it is Jim Morrison dancing around on the screen, the effect is even more enhanced because Kilmer sang most of the concert scenes (in the DVD commentary, Stone informs us Kilmer sang ALL of the 1969 Miami concert sequence) and as a performer, he has a pretty good voice. The movie captures not only the madness of Morrison, but also the atmosphere and lore of his music. The movie uses no score, it imploys the Doors songs to create the mood (while squeezing in ""Venus In Furs"" by Velvet Underground and the classic opus ""Carmina Burana""). There are moments of insansity and excess that create a hypnotic intensity driven by the rich, dreamy photography by Robert Richardson, and there are even, amidst the sex, drugs and rock n' roll, some moments of romantic sweetness in a poetic way when Morrison rhymes for his girl Pamela Courson (played by Meg Ryan). Stone used completely live audiences for the concert sequences, which are exhilarating and stunning, especially a gothic sequence in San Francisco when the band performs ""Not To Touch The Earth."" Any Doors fan will love this film, especially since the soundtrack, featuring all the greats like ""Break On Through,"" ""Backdoor Man,"" ""Light My Fire,"" ""Strange Days,"" ""The Crystal Ship"" and ""Five To One"" pulses with the Doors sound, and hearing Kilmer deliver his own performances is a treat no Doors afficionado or rock enthusiast should miss.

74361,A1536VSPC386SQ,0784010528,"The Hermit ""The Hermit""","[0, 5]","Hello there,THE FILM THAT BLEW THE COVER OF THE LEGEND THAT IS THE DOORSThe Doors revokes the worldwide interest of shamanism and the protection of the environment against illegal construction corporate activities and still continues to leave the lives of whoever watch it changed forever.Watching the Doors is beyound reading the works of Bob Frizzel or Drunvalo Melchizedek or having a chat with Stewart Swerdlow.The film touches the heart of the entire population on this planet as it continues to be watched - this time by myself , yesterday and being finished today. Jim Moors died happy - looking towards the limit of the horizon , having freed himself finally from his mortal body , in the year 1971. He was a first class self - initiated shaman who followed the Native American Tradition , according to Stone , and not Satanism , as portrayed in the rock'n roll classic documentary Hell's Bells.So obsessed with freeing his soul from his mortal body did Jim Morrison become that nothing else mattered , sometimes not even 'the one'or his wife.Jim Morrison taught people that in order to overcome fear you must confront it - literally. He was totally unafraid of fame and fortune and definately did not literally believe in Satan. He believed instead , according to Stone , in the Great Spirit being nature itself and loved the desert - out there , like Charles Manson , Jim Morrison felt restful and at peace and at one with his heart and the girl he loved who would grow up and become one of the most famous women of all time , who would have even silent wannabes wanting to be like her among many of America's leading politicians , such as Sarah Palin or Hillary Clinton , who must have secretly desired to be wives of Jim Morrison in some of their sickest , sexcual fantasies which can only be defined as normal due to the spirit of the times.And what's wrong with any woman wanting to be the wife of a famous rock star? What Jim Morrison exposed was the body of our once inner policeman , who is slowly being killed and whose body is still in the process of being processed. That is what he means when he says that most of us are in fact slaves. I do not even allow myself to speak profanely here when I state that , so I'll leave the spirit of Jim Morrison to once again remind us of the importance of NOT BEING SLAVES to anyone , even ourselves. But Jim Morrison ended up being a slave to the drugs that he was so quick to get addicted to , and freed himself from his drug slavery in the end , fearlessly , calmly , rationally , irrationally , spatially , happily , sexually , fantastically , and quite honestly brilliantly.He became one of history's greatest rock stars , and as Michael Jackson died , so would his generation be resurrected. Finally Jim Morrison roams free in the spirit world - let's hope he does not end up in a place belonging to the mind of such people as Peggy Kane when it comes to talk about his hopefully happy afterlife. The film explodes the senses with it's surreal lack of special effects , and bestows upon the entire population of the people of the United States a form of nakedness and self - exposure which a worker in the black project programmes can only dream of. Jim Marrison may have been a black tulip that got eaten by drugs - but in the end he defeated his drug addiction doing it the only way he thought appropriate at that time.He wanted to defy death , and sometimes wondered if he could defy his own fame. He believed in life , liberty , hope , love , hate , anything a man can believe in - and loved his wife and children more than anyone and anything. He was a man who had it all , and got it all in the end , got bored by it , and wanted to explore more. For the spirit of the personality that was Jim Morrison still lives on to this day. Therefore I say that this is without doupt , Oliver Stone's best film. Everything is changing now as our society chooses to abandon zealous materialism , and all kinds of extreme forms of variations of religions , and new and more forgiving varieties of spirituality are constructed , out of the ashes of the less forgiving cults.Everything is changed in the mind of the viewer of this film - it quite literally tunes you in , then drops you out and that with more sheer quality of surreal realism than anything Videodrome by David Chronenberg had ever attempted to do , an equally fascinating and good film to watch nonetheless. This is one of a kind of a movie - and there aren't that many musical films I've seen. Way to go Oliver Stone , still receiving honest and positive criticism on this brilliant work of genius whose immortal spirit can never be defeated , and way to go for Val Kilmer.This is the best EVER movie I've ever seen starring him.",5,One brilliant work of genius whose immortal spirit can never be defeated,1247011200,"07 8, 2009",2009,4754,"['Hello', 'there', 'THE', 'FILM', 'THAT', 'BLEW',

74362,AB8MSE5JHEG97,0784010528,Thomas Plotkin,"[7, 9]","This is Oliver Stone's best film, Val Kilmer's best performance, and the 2d best fiction film representation of a rock band (This Is Spinal Tap is the best, of course). But first, the bad news:Stone's miscogyny nearly sinks the film. Morrison's significant other,Pamela Courson, was by all accounts, a tough as nails hippy chick who had the measure of her man. Jim was as devoted to her as he could be to a woman, and while both strayed often, they always came back to each other. Doors songs memorializing their relationship, like ""Queen of the Highway,"" are a window into what Ray Manzarek termed a great love story. In the film, poor Meg Ryan (an excellent physical match for Pam) plays her as a nagging whiny scold, always trying to stop our hero from doing whatever it is a man's gotta do. Nothing could have been further from the truth, as Pam's refusal to put Jim on a leash was what kept them together. Her character is intolerable in the flick, just like Sissy Spacek's performance as Jim Garrison's wife in JFK and Daryl Hannah's in Wall Street, and is likely more representative of Stone's relationships with sundry long-suffering ex-wives than Pam and Jim.  Stone's miscogny rears its ugly head again in his slander of Nico, the ethereal, brilliant ice goddess, here depicted as a balloon-breasted nekkid bimbo. Ugh.These 2 dead women are sadly not around to kick Stone's butt for the injustice committed herein.Second: for a movie called ""The Doors,"" Robby Krieger, John Densmore, and Ray Manzarek are relegated to the background of the film. Morrison deferred to them in all matters artistic, and in return they provided him with a splendid musical carpet, backing his every unpredictable move every step of the way. While the film does justice to the music, it barely acknowledges the contribution of the musicians, without whom Morrison knew and acknowledged he was nothing. Character-wise, they seem like low-key versions of Pam, bemused and upset by Jim's antics where I suspect in real life they were enablers and facilitors and collaborators.Now the good: perhaps because and not in spite of the fact Stone was stuck in the jungles of Vietnam while this story was being played out, as an imaginative re-creation of The Summer of Love and its dark aftermath, this film is nonpareil. Every detail of decor and costume, every location, seems dead-on accurate. [except for the fact that the women who pack the gigs look like they just tumbled off a casting couch...] I think Stone relished making up for the '60's he missed, and threw himself into the project with discipline and love. (Think of this as the homefront story playing out behind Platoon and Born on the 4th of July...)The concert scenes are phenomenal, orchestrated chaos spiraling out of control, while the ring-leader looks on with a bemused, ironic detatchment, not quite knowing what to make of the mindless Dionysian energies he has un-leashed in his audience.Morrison speaks to Stone: both are products of the counterculture gestalt, both are artists who mix vast talent with vast pretension, excess, bombast, a boatload of drugs, and macho nonsense in equal measure. Stone's aesthetic failings are also Morrison's (great pop star/wretched poet), so the weaknesses of the film don't really hurt the movie, they make it seem more true to Mr Mojo Risin's messed up genius.Finally -- Val Kilmer. This performance/incarnation is flat-out uncanny. Beyond capturing the obvious -- the looks, the voice, the stance, the charisma -- Kilmer also catches the irony and anti-star compulsions; his bemused role-playing when he poses for cheesecake photos for the cover of 16 magazine, his desire to shake up his audience by all the means at his disposal, his willful physical degeneration, pulling the plug on his Pop Star persona by turning himself into a tubby bearded wino/bluesman in record time. Kilmer never lets us forget Morrison was something of a clown, waiting and watching to see what would happen next when he ventured out further on the edge, appreciating the absurdity of the endeavor. Kilmer's sense of humor and self-mockery is what saves the movie from pretension, as it ultimately saves Morrison's art.Formally, this movie initiated the chaotic visual style, expressionist psychedelic agit-prop, which Stone brought to fruition in subsequent films like JFK, Natural Born Killers, and Nixon. The film seems to careen out of control, but Stone's hand is firmly on the tiller. By the time we get to the legendary Miami concert that basically ended the band's career, with Kilmer/Morrison exhorting his equally whacked-out audience to follow him all the way, but clueless as to the destination, the swirling disembodied camera, perfectly re-created music, and wild montage really puts us in the heart of an epoch long past -- I really felt like i was there. Warts and all, a classic.",4,"""Motel Money Murder Madness...""",1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,4872,"['Oliver', 'Stone', 'best', 'film', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'best', 'performance', '2d', 'best',

Watt,"[22, 28]","The Doors suffers the same problems that Stone's other films about real people and events (JFK and Nixon) do; Stone uses the docu-drama format as a license to condense times and events, while simultaneously inventing composite characters and situations that never existed. All too often, these films, while containing exciting filmic and visual elements, ring a bit hollow.The upside of The Doors is the performance of Val Kilmer, who threw himself into the role with ferocity and conviction; that he comes up short in the end isn't due to his acting abilities as much as the choice of episodes and Morrison's characteristics (both real and invented) that Stone chose to film. Simply put, Stone's Morrison comes across as little more than a sporatically gifted poet who sublimates his poetic callings to all the cliched rock star trappings. Perhaps this does describe some of Morrison's personality to a degree, but after seeing Morrison get stoned, drunk and act like a spoiled child throwing a tantrum for 2 hours plus, one wonders if Oliver thought of Morrison as basically an obnoxious drunk (possessed by the soul of a bald, silly-looking, half-naked dead indian that continually wanders around the movie) and, if so, what it was that turned Stone onto making the film in the first place...The downside, in addition to the lack of scope regarding Morrison, comes in the numerous episodes that never happened (The Doors tripping on acid in the desert, Patricia Kennealy being present at the New Haven show Morrison got arrested at, Particia Kennealy and Pam Courson having a catfight, Buick actually making a commercial using the song Light My Fire and Jim finding out about it by watching tv, Jim setting fire to his and Pam's house while Pam was smacked up in the closet...and on and on). Also, the years of 1967 to early 1969 take up about an hour and a half of the movie, while the remainder of 1969 through to mid 1971 take about twenty minutes.It's a shame that Stone went to such trouble to set up and film some great concert sequences, and Kilmer really made a terrific attempt at playing Morrison, but in the end both were content to rest the character on both the various myths about the singer and the confirmed instances of Morrison at his drunken worst.

Acid, alcohol, and eventually heroin: it all did him in. This is perhaps the most important point made in Oliver Stone's biography of the still-popular title band famed for its lyricist's creativity and unique sound. Early on in the film we see that all of the members are taking acid, experimenting with drugs, etc. but it was Morrison who continued. His bandmates took acid to expand the mind while he maintained the practice till his progressive demise; Stone supposes he took himself and his acid too seriously, and though little exploration into the depths of Morrison's psyche take place otherwise, at least this notion is analyzed persuasively and even movingly.What's initially noticed is Stone's impeccable recreation of the era: the drugs, the sex, the psychedellic sense of style. Stone has always been amazing with visuals but here he really achieves a triumphant grasp of aesthetic milieu. Lighting, color: it contributes to the idea that most of the era was a bizarre mix of acid and something or other. People were twisted, and willingly so. The colors really are mesmerizing, from the Oscar-worthy sets and costumes to Robert Richardson's as-usual excellent DP work. The general motif is an orange-red, a color that suggests The Doors' curiously dark sound again enhancing everything we hear and everything we see.So, it can be said that on a technical level The Doors is an achievement, yet it feels entirely lacking in the area of actual profundity. We never get a true sense of who Jim Morrison is, or who the rest of The Doors are. If anything the film should have been called Morrison or something just as obvious (which is a given in the biopic genre), because really the film is him. Maybe that's the point, since most of what Stone chooses to portray are Morrison's self-indulgences, which actor Val Kilmer performs perfectly (despite his overall superficiality). The rest of the actors do fine with toss-away roles as people in Morrison's life that are simply there to remind us of the real world outside of his halucinogenic brain. It's really a pity because their story is interesting, yet all the information is spread too thin considering the exploration only concerns Morrison and none of the other colorful characters.When the film does stretch at least the imagery is enough to sustain interest. There is a brilliant acid trip sequence in a desert which serves to remind us of the artistry that was (and still is, in some cases) derived from such practices. Native American imagery is intertwined with a riotous concert to emphasize Morrison's shamanism. It is all so compelling, but it can feel a bit wasted. Luckily the images are as memorable in themselves as you would imagine, also featuring the striking image of a dead Jim Morrison engulfed in water, the same orange-red filling the bathroom. Some of the shamanism imagery also provides one of the few forays into Morrison's psyche. Stone effectively portrays his feeling of unification with the shaman lifestyle.In terms of the biopic genre The Doors is...okay, and possibly something I'd watch again. Besides towering triumphs like Raging Bull I haven't come across anything entirely of worth (*cough..Ray...cough*). The Doors, though visually exciting and sometimes involving, is ultimately thin, which is a pity. I love The Doors and Jim Morrison was an interesting man, but Stone just doesn't do their story as much justice as it deserves. Still, given that I've grown to love The Doors I can imagine watching this at late night hang-outs with my best friend Adrienne (she's obsessed). You know? I'd say this is a film for true Doors fans. If you love The Doors you'll watch this film over and over, despite any flaws. If anything Stone manages to portray their mystique and creative aspirations most satisfactorily.",3,This is the end...,1129680000,"10 19, 2005",2005,4049,"['end', 'Beautiful', 'friendThis', 'end', 'My', 'only', 'friend', 'endOf', 'elaborate', 'plans', 'endOf', 'everything', 'endNo', 'safety', 'surprise', 'end', 'moment', 'Doors', 'front', 'man', 'Jim', 'Morrisen', 'took', 'acid', 'was', 'end', 'Acid', 'alcohol', 'eventually', 'heroin', 'did', 'perhaps', 'most', 'important', 'point', 'made', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'biography', 'still-popular', 'title', 'band', 'famed', 'lyricist', 'creativity', 'unique', 'sound', 'Early', 'film', 'see', 'members', 'are', 'taking', 'acid', 'experimenting', 'drugs', 'etc', 'was', 'Morrison', 'who', 'continued', 'bandmates', 'took', 'acid', 'expand', 'mind', 'maintained', 'practice', 'till', 'progressive', 'demise', 'Stone', 'took', 'acid', 'too', 'seriously', 'little', 'exploration', 'depths', 'Morrison', 'psyche', 'take', 'place', 'otherwise', 'least', 'notion', 'analyzed', 'persuasively', 'even', 'movingly.What', 'initially', 'noticed', 'Stone', 'impeccable', 'recreation', 'era', 'drugs', 'sex', 'psychedellic', 'sense', 'style', 'Stone', 'always', 'been', 'amazing', 'visuals', 'here', 'really', 'triumphant', 'grasp', 'aesthetic', 'milieu', 'Lighting', 'color', 'idea', 'most', 'era', 'was', 'bizarre', 'mix', 'acid', 'something', 'other', 'People', 'were', 'twisted', 'willingly', 'so', 'colors', 'really', 'are', 'mesmerizing', 'Oscar-worthy', 'sets', 'costumes', 'Robert', 'Richardson', 'as-usual', 'excellent', 'DP', 'work', 'general', 'motif', 'orange-red', 'color', 'Doors', 'curiously', 'dark', 'sound', 'again', 'enhancing', 'everything', 'hear', 'everything', 'see.So', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'technical', 'level', 'Doors', 'achievement', 'entirely', 'lacking', 'area', 'actual', 'profundity', 'never', 'get', 'true', 'sense', 'who', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'who', 'rest', 'Doors', 'are', 'anything', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Morrison', 'something', 'just', 'obvious', 'given', 'biopic', 'genre', 'really', 'film', 'Maybe', 'point', 'most', 'what', 'Stone', 'portray', 'are', 'Morrison', 'self-indulgences', 'actor', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'performs', 'perfectly', 'overall', 'superficiality', 'rest', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'toss-away', 'roles', 'people', 'Morrison', 'life', 'are', 'simply', 'there', 'remind', 'real', 'world', 'halucinogenic', 'brain', 'really', 'pity', 'story', 'interesting', 'yet', 'information', 'spread', 'too', 'thin', 'considering', 'exploration', 'only', 'Morrison', 'none', 'other', 'colorful', 'characters.When', 'film', 'stretch', 'least', 'imagery', 'enough', 'sustain', 'interest', 'brilliant', 'acid', 'trip', 'sequence', 'desert', 'remind', 'artistry', 'was', 'still', 'cases', 'derived', 'such', 'practices', 'Native', 'American', 'imagery', 'intertwined', 'riotous', 'concert', 'emphasize', 'Morrison', 'shamanism', 'so', 'compelling', 'can', 'feel', 'bit', 'wasted', 'Luckily', 'images', 'are', 'memorable', 'would', 'imagine', 'also', 'featuring', 'striking', 'image', 'dead', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'engulfed', 'water', 'same', 'orange-red', 'filling', 'bathroom', 'shamanism', 'imagery', 'also', 'one', 'few', 'forays', 'Morrison', 'psyche', 'Stone', 'effectively', 'feeling', 'unification', 'shaman', 'lifestyle.In', 'terms', 'biopic', 'Doors', 'okay', 'possibly', 'something', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', 'towering', 'triumphs', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'have', ""n't"", 'come', 'anything', 'entirely', 'worth', '*cough..Ray', 'cough*', 'Doors', 'visually', 'exciting', 'sometimes', 'involving', 'ultimately', 'thin', 'pity', 'love', 'Doors', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'was', 'interesting', 'man', 'Stone', 'just', ""n't"", 'do', 'story', 'much', 'justice', 'Still', 'given', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'love', 'Doors', 'can', 'imagine', 'watching', 'late', 'night', 'hang-outs', 'best', 'friend', 'Adrienne', 'obsessed', 'know', ""'d"", 'say', 'film', 'true', 'Doors', 'fans', 'love', 'Doors', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'film', 'flaws', 'anything', 'Stone', 'portray', 'mystique', 'creative', 'aspirations', 'most', 'satisfactorily']",N/A

Supposedly, Stone was inspired by the book No One Here Gets Out Alive (written by Jerry Hopkins in 1973-74, but not published until 1980 when Danny Sugerman, Jim's one-time teenage factotum, did some judicious rewriting), but very little of the book, even, is present in this film.  I had to see it three times just to believe what I was seeing--in short, an absolute hatchet job on Jim Morrison, and nothing like the real Jim at all.I honestly have no idea where the scene with Jim locking Pam in a burning closet came from; nowhere in the Doors' history does this incident appear.  Jim did not meet Patricia Kennealy in 1967 (Kennealy herself has verified this in her book, Strange Days: My Life With and Without Jim Morrison) at a press conference; their first meeting was a private interview in New York City in January 1969.  And she was not the girl who was with him backstage in New Haven when he was famously maced by a cop, then told that story onstage and was promptly arrested for doing so.  Jim was not the sadistic, unfeeling creature portrayed in the film--you honestly don't feel sorry for him when he dies at the end--and even the infamous ""Miami Incident"" is misportrayed.  He did not offer to show off his penis to the audience, and although he did attempt to do so, he was forcibly restrained from it by one of the band's roadies.  And Pam was not with him during the trial, which stretched out over many months between 1969 and 1970; Jim never said of his handfasting to Kennealy that ""I was stoned, it seemed like a fun thing to do at the time.""  He was very serious about his vows to her (and no, she is not paying me to say any of this.  I've read her book and I've read some of the other books, and I think I'm able to judge what's truth and what's clearly fabrication).Also, we'd do well to remember that Stone was off in Vietnam while much of this was going on--his own idea, and given a fictitious-yet-autobiographical treatment in Platoon--and just apart from that, he tends toward sweeping overstatement.

As Kilmer plays him, Morrison never had many thoughts that didn't come from a book or other obscure source and after about an hour, his one-note performance wears really thin (the scene in the desert, while visually stunning, has some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard!)and you just want him to drop the facade and let us see the real Jim. The musical performances are very well staged and with the exception of an inaccurate re-creation of the band on &quot;Ed Sullivan&quot; (Morrison didn't leer into the camera and exaggerate the word 'higher')the film seems fairly close to capturing the real thing and the heady times of the Doors popularity. The bonus disc of bonus material is a worthwhile addition to this set. This is, in my opinion Oliver Stone's masterpiece. I just hope he goes back and does some re-balancing of the colors in this film, then it will be a true classic.",4,Good Movie.....,1055635200,"06 15, 2003",2003,1359,"['.but', 'just', 'have', 'one', 'quibble', 'everything', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'movie', 'sound', 'chant', 'reading', 'book', 'meaning', 'life', 'serpents', 'garden', 'just', 'head', 'understand', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'was', 'brilliant', 'original', 'thinker', 'quot', 'quot', 'did', 'guy', 'ever', 'just', 'talk', 'regular', 'person', 'Could', 'band', 'really', 'function', 'frontman', 'who', 'was', 'constant', 'state', 'drunkeness', 'high', 'acid', 'Kilmer', 'Morrison', 'never', 'had', 'many', 'thoughts', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'book', 'other', 'obscure', 'source', 'hour', 'one-note', 'performance', 'wears', 'really', 'thin', 'scene', 'desert', 'visually', 'stunning', 'worst', 'dialogue', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'just', 'want', 'drop', 'facade', 'let', 'see', 'real', 'Jim', 'musical', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'staged', 'exception', 'inaccurate', 're-creation', 'band', 'quot', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'quot', 'Morrison', 'did', ""n't"", 'leer', 'camera', 'exaggerate', 'word', ""'higher"", 'film', 'fairly', 'close', 'capturing', 'real', 'thing', 'heady', 'times', 'Doors', 'popularity', 'bonus', 'disc', 'bonus', 'material', 'worthwhile', 'addition', 'set', 'opinion', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'masterpiece', 'just', 'hope', 'back', 're-balancing', 'colors', 'film', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'true', 'classic']",N/A
74372,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,0784010528,Wuchak,"[4, 5]","The Southern California band The Doors were a big hit around 1966-1971. The band ended when singer Jim Morrison flew to France to pursue a different career and shortly later died due to his ongoing drug abuse.I'm not old enough to remember The Doors. I hail from the later era of Judas Priest and Metallica. The first time I ever heard of The Doors was when my much-older brother asked me if I knew of them. I busted out laughing saying, ""The Doors? Why don't they just call themselves The Window Sills."" Yeah, I thought the name was pretty ridiculous until I discovered Jim Morrison's reasoning behind it:There is what is knownAnd there is what is unknownInbetween are the doorsNeedless to say, I stopped laughing. Another thing that won my respect for The Doors was their song that was used in the opening of APOCALYPSE NOW, which is my all-time favorite film (the original version, that is, not that Frankenstein ""Redux""). I didn't know the name of the song so I bought their ""Best Of"" album hoping to find it but unfortunately discovered that it wasn't on there. Anyway, this ""Best Of"" album was my first exposure to their music other than APOCALYPSE NOW and their hits that were regularly played on the radio. My first impression was that their sound was horribly dated, even THEN. Over time, however, I've come to respect The Doors' music because it's so unique. They don't sound like anyone but themselves. They have a weird, moody vibe, even their 'hits.' And over top of it all is Morrison's commanding and haunting voice. Anyway, I'm more of a fan of their more artistic songs like ""Riders on the Storm"" and ""The End"" as opposed to their 'hits,' but who can deny the catchiness of ""Light My Fire"" or the goofy charm of ""People are Strange""?I've only seen Oliver Stone's THE DOORS (1991) twice, including a recent viewing. The film focuses on Jim Morrison and leaves the viewer with the impression that he was a miserable artistic-genius type who had no sense of moderation; he sought to escape his personal pain through loose sex, substance misuse and rock 'n' roll. His excessive self-abuse spilled over to those closest to him and ultimately landed him in a premature grave. His body lies in Paris, a mecca to his fans who have spray-painted all the surrounding monuments with graffiti, some of it profane. The image this leaves you with is that Jim Morrison is no fun to be around, even in death.So THE DOORS is pretty much the ultimate story of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Stone said he based his view of Morrison, as depicted in the film, on 160 transcripts of people that actually knew him or were around him and the band. From these documents emerged a central truth about Morrison's final five years of existence, an image of wild excess and abuse. Because of this, I was left with a pretty bad impression. I felt Morrison was a spaced-out, immature jerk, abusive to both himself and others, foolishly sacrificing his life and talents at the altar of drug & alcohol idolatry.This is only part of the truth, I discovered. Thankfully I watched the 37-minute documentary on the 'extras' disk ""The Road to Excess"" wherein one of Morrison's sweethearts, Patricia Kenealy, the guitarist Robby and another guy give the other side of the story. They properly point out that Stone's film only shows Jim's 'wild & crazy' side, emphasizing that the events depicted in the picture, while generally true, aren't ""all that happened."" They unanimously describe Morrison as genuine, sweet, innocent, shy, loving and gallant, an amazing person who made those around him feel important, as if he was their best friend. Robby even states that Jim was ""the most influential person I've ever met.""In addition, the documentary features numerous clips of Morrison himself, clearly showing him to be a fun-loving, nice and sane person rather than the spaced-out, abuse-driven dude shown in the film. Needless to say, the documentary helps round-out one's image of the man and is itself worth the price of admission.By 1971 Jim realized that an inaccurate image was created around him, the natural byproduct of his fame. He sought to destroy this image by fleeing to France and starting a new life as a writer and filmmaker. Unfortunately Paris was decadent and he wasn't allowed to come clean. He was too famous. He couldn't escape the shackles of excess and consequently died because of it. Both Jim Morrison's life and the film are a pitiable portrait of self-destruction. What a waste of incredible talent.FINAL ANALYSIS: The picture is very good in a groovy kind of way. Val Kilmer doesn't just play Jim Morrison, he IS Jim Morrison. This is no small feat and very important to the success of the picture in light of the fact that he appears in practically every frame. He should have won an award, to say the least. In any event, if you're in the mood for something that will capture that late-60s counter-culture vibe THE DOORS is the film to see (next to the documentary WOODSTOCK, that is). It's mesmerizing in a spaced-out way and naturally features The Doors' music throughout. Unfortunately it offers a very limited and unflattering impression of Jim Morrison. That's why it's essential that the viewer also watch ""The Road to Excess"" on the second disk.In this documentary, by the way, Oliver Stone makes a couple of really asinine statements. Commenting on Morrison, he states: ""To live life intensely and well and die young and achieve everlasting fame & glory is the greatest. It's Achilles, it's Alexander, it's... Jim Morrison."" Huh? Another one is: ""The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom."" Is he on drugs? Jim's road of excess lead straight to an early grave, not enlightenment.CONTENT WARNING: Unless you're a total doofus, anyone choosing to view a film like THE DOORS knows that it's probably going to try to capture the 'free-love' drug culture of the late-60s. Hence, there's a lot of female nudity and overt sex & drug scenes. If you can't stomach this for whatever reason, stay away.PERSONAL GRADE: The film itself: B+ The ""Road to Excess"" documentary: A",4,"This film ONLY shows the 'wild,' spaced-out, abusive side of Jim

74373,A3S98L5B1SR9P1,0784010528,Zack H.,"[1, 2]","Formed by Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek at a night on the beach after Jim read some of his poems to Ray, The Doors became one of the greatest rock bands of all time in the late 60s. Jim Morrison was one of the first rock n roll rebels and wrote some of the darkest, deepest songs ever (""The End"", ""Strange Days"", etc.) Even Iggy and the Stooges and the MC5 started a band themselves after being mesmerized at a Doors concert. The band started in 1965, and released their first album in 1967, and sadly the original band ended in 1971, due to Jim Morrison's unfortunate death.Oliver Stone's film is more about Jim Morrison than the band, to be honest. Val Kilmer's performance is so convincing, you'd think you're watching Jim in the film (and in some shots, you are!). It has been said that even the surviving Doors members had trouble distinguishing Kilmer's vocals from Morrison's own. Val Kilmer should've at least been nominated for an oscar. The actors playing the other Doors members (Kyle MacLachlan, Kevin Dillion, and Frank Whaley) have some screen time, but as I said, the movie is basically about Jim. I think this is an excellent bio-pic, but some would disagree. So, check it out if you're a fan, or even if you aren't a fan. It's a masterpiece.
