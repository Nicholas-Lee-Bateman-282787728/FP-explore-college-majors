750167,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00008YJCB,Einsatz,"[1, 1]","I bought this lone episode from the long running British TV series, Midsomer Murders, to see what they were like and if they were worth considering as a whole (price notwithstanding).  If this episode is any indication of their overall quality, I'd have to say I'd just found another series to invest in (which is both good and bad: price notwithstanding!).The mystery of Death's Shadow was intriguing enough to hold my interest throughout, the lead characters were a very engaging team (none of the usual bickering expected in American police procedurals).  There were plenty of suspicious suspects and a suitably gruesome series of murders.  The first victim was a man with a brain tumor who soon loses his head.  I liked that the clues seemed to move in several directions at the same time.  Even if you don't like mysteries per se, the story and characters were fascinating in and of themselves to make this worthwhile viewing.",5,"""I've got a lot on my mind.""",1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,931,"['bought', 'lone', 'episode', 'long', 'running', 'British', 'TV', 'series', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'see', 'what', 'were', 'like', 'were', 'worth', 'considering', 'whole', 'price', 'notwithstanding', 'episode', 'indication', 'overall', 'quality', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', ""'d"", 'just', 'found', 'series', 'invest', 'good', 'bad', 'price', 'notwithstanding', '.The', 'mystery', 'Death', 'Shadow', 'was', 'intriguing', 'enough', 'hold', 'interest', 'lead', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'engaging', 'team', 'none', 'usual', 'bickering', 'expected', 'American', 'police', 'procedurals', 'were', 'plenty', 'suspicious', 'suspects', 'suitably', 'gruesome', 'series', 'murders', 'first', 'victim', 'was', 'man', 'brain', 'tumor', 'who', 'soon', 'head', 'liked', 'clues', 'seemed', 'move', 'several', 'directions', 'same', 'time', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'mysteries', 'se', 'story', 'characters', 'were', 'fascinating', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'viewing']",Midsomer Murders: Death's Shadow 1999

I'm unsure how I feel about this show; I've never seen Midsomer Murders before this. Apparently this program is always highly rated and thought highly of, but based on this episode, I'm not sure I'm interested.",3,Entertaining and Creepy,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,352,"['scenery', 'architecture', 'village', 'was', 'so', 'pretty', 'serene', 'yet', 'crime', 'was', 'so', 'appalling', 'gory', 'plot', 'seemed', 'bit', 'incredible', ""'m"", 'unsure', 'how', 'feel', 'show', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Midsomer', 'Murders', 'Apparently', 'program', 'always', 'highly', 'rated', 'thought', 'highly', 'based', 'episode', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'m"", 'interested']",Midsomer Murders: Death's Shadow 1999
750171,A2ONXBK70IJ193,B00008YJCB,"Richard Nash Creel ""Diogenes""","[1, 2]","The quality of British acting and film production puts, in this case, per ususal, American ""works"" to utter shame. The level of Midsomer is, due to escapism and snobbery implicit in the milieu, the characters, their activities and even the way they speak, below that of, say, A Touch of Frost, a truly excellent show and series. I still would recommend the programs in Midsomer Murders, but with the caveat that, going by the product descriptions on Amazon, frequently deficient if not plain wrong, the purchaser is likely to be disappointed. In this case,in the show, Death's Shadow, which I recently saw, there is NO Prunella Scales to be found.
