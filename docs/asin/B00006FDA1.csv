The horror/gore elements are very solid in this movie and there are parts that still give me chills even after the dozen or more viewings I've done on this. Some of the ghosts look a little cartoony, but the special effects are top-notch. Surprising for a made-for-TV movie. I like almost all the characters (except for the one you are supposed to dislike) and the actors are all very good. The dialogue and plot both flow smoothly too. I recommend that horror movie fans watch this movie, but keep in mind that the movie both takes itself seriously and mocks itself at times. I think you will like it if you just give it a chance.

712903,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00006FDA1,B. E Jackson,"[7, 8]","Lost Voyage is a spectacular horror movie about a bunch of people who finally find an old ghost ship after disappearing in the Bermuda Triangle for more than 30 years.The horror segments were truly exciting.  One scene showed a ghost angel floating down from the skies and diving right through an old man standing on the top floor of the ship.  You see, the whole idea of the storyline came from the mystery of what lies beyond the Bermuda Triangle from as far back as World War II when airplanes disappeared completely, and no trace of them has ever been recovered.  Lost Voyage takes that storyline and makes it about a ship that disappears and when it finally returns, it's old, stinky, creepy, and haunted.The story eventually turned into the people finding out what they wanted on the ship wasn't worth the trouble after all, because a mysterious cloud cover was quickly heading their way from way off in the distance, so they had to get out of there before the ghosts aboard killed each person one by one.I really was creeped out by the rocking horse moving by itself, the water turning on and frying a guy working on electrical wires and whatnot, and the guy who was taking down his camera set-up and looked in one of the televisions and saw a woman who was apparently right behind the man, but when he turned around she wasn't there.

Lost Voyage is a perfect example. In many ways it plays out a lot like a 'season primiere' of an X-Files episode or something of that nature. It has the feel of a TV movie, but overall the acting, set design, cinematography, and *especially* sound were very well created and very much attributed to a great, and spooky, envioronment. I think people spend far too much time during the movie looking for things they can insult that they miss what was going on, and it's their loss in this case.It has an unsettling level of eerieness to it, similar to House on Haunted Hill (N. Castle). Many scenes left you silent and pondering...what...the...heck...was that? If it wasn't for the excellent sound, it probably would've lost that feel.CGIs are used quite frequently, but they aren't the dollar-and-dime calibre work you see on made-for-TV movies.

712908,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00006FDA1,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[17, 17]","There's just something about ghost ship movies that I cannot resist, so when I spotted Lost Voyage, I had to watch it.  The fact that the movie is a straight-to-video/DVD release I had never heard of before made no difference.  Judd Nelson was a familiar name from the 1980s, and the presence of Lance Henriksen from TV's Millennium series seemed to bode well.  It's quite an interesting movie, not necessarily in a good way.  There are a few moments of decent suspense, and the acting really isn't all that bad, yet the movie seemed to pose questions it never intended to answer, and the special effects are just plain weird.As the movie opens, we see the beginning and ignominious end of the final voyage of the cruise ship Corona Queen in 1972; somewhere in the vicinity of the Bermuda Triangle, the ship disappeared into an unexplained atmospheric phenomenon.  No sign of the ship was ever found &#65533; until now.  After more than twenty-five years, the ship has suddenly been spotted by a fishing vessel off the coast of Bermuda.  This news is particularly interesting for Aaron Brown (Judd Nelson), whose father and step-mother were among the passengers of the ill-fated cruise.  He has obsessively studied the Bermuda Triangle ever since, and now he finds himself one of the first human beings to set foot on the mysterious ship in over a quarter of a century.  With him are Dana Elway (Janet Gunn), the star of a paranormal based news show, and her crew, alongside a trio of salvage men led by David Shaw (Henriksen).  They discover the ship to be in remarkably good condition, but no sign of crew or passengers is to be found.  As you might expect, bad things start happening that try to be creepy but never really are, and the dwindling number of individuals on board find themselves in danger of heading back into whatever claimed the ship way back in 1972.The visions that some of the characters see on board the ship supposedly represent their biggest fears or most disturbing memories, but they don't really play that well.  We are treated to numerous flashbacks and mysterious new visitations by Aaron's long-dead father, but none of these personal stories seems at all important in the end.  I do have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Scarlet Chorvat as the younger reporter scheming to take Dana Elway's job, and her storyline actually seemed to make a little bit of sense.  The really weird thing about Lost Voyage, though, is its special effects.  Things aren't really that bad until the closing scenes of the movie, when CGI animation suddenly runs amuck.  Many of the climactic scenes look like the kinds of animation you would see in a computer or gaming console game; in a game, they would be impressive, but in a movie they are quite disappointingly fake; I can't recall ever seeing another movie wherein the animation suddenly took on such a peculiar look.The real source of weakness in the movie, though, is the plot.  Too many story elements are introduced for no apparent reason, almost nothing about the fate of the ghost liner is revealed, and the end of the movie is quite disappointing.  To make matters worse, the two epilogue sequences make very little sense to me and only serve to reinforce the failed opportunities that seem to define Lost Voyage.  Despite all of these problems, though, I cannot say I actually hated the film.  It had enough potential to keep me interested, but a lot of that potential was wasted in the end.",3,Voyage of unrealized potential,1063411200,"09 13, 2003",2003,3493,"['just', 'something', 'ghost', 'ship', 'movies', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'when', 'spotted', 'Lost', 'Voyage', 'had', 'watch', 'fact', 'movie', 'straight-to-video/DVD', 'release', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'before', 'made', 'difference', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'was', 'familiar', 'name', '1980s', 'presence', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'TV', 'Millennium', 'series', 'seemed', 'bode', 'well', 'quite', 'interesting', 'movie', 'not', 'necessarily', 'good', 'way', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'decent', 'suspense', 'acting', 'really', ""n't"", 'bad', 'yet', 'movie', 'seemed', 'pose', 'questions', 'never', 'intended', 'answer', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'weird.As', 'movie', 'see', 'beginning', 'ignominious', 'end', 'final', 'voyage', 'cruise', 'ship', 'Corona', 'Queen', '1972', 'somewhere', 'vicinity', 'Bermuda', 'Triangle', 'ship', 'disappeared', 'unexplained', 'atmospheric', 'phenomenon', 'sign', 'ship', 'was', 'ever', 'found', '65533', 'now', 'more', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'ship', 'suddenly', 'been', 'spotted', 'fishing', 'vessel', 'coast', 'Bermuda', 'news', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'Aaron', 'Brown', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'father', 'step-mother', 'were', 'passengers', 'ill-fated', 'cruise', 'obsessively', 'studied', 'Bermuda', 'Triangle', 'ever', 'now', 'one', 'first', 'human', 'beings', 'set', 'foot', 'mysterious', 'ship', 'quarter', 'century', 'are', 'Dana', 'Elway', 'Janet', 'Gunn', 'star', 'paranormal', 'based', 'news', 'show', 'crew', 'trio', 'salvage', 'men', 'led', 'David', 'Shaw', 'Henriksen', 'discover', 'ship', 'be', 'remarkably', 'good', 'condition', 'sign', 'crew', 'passengers', 'be', 'found', 'might', 'expect', 'bad', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'try', 'be', 'creepy', 'never', 'really', 'are', 'dwindling', 'number', 'individuals', 'board', 'find', 'danger', 'heading', 'back', 'claimed', 'ship', 'way', 'back', '1972.The', 'visions', 'characters', 'see', 'board', 'ship', 'supposedly', 'represent', 'biggest', 'fears', 'most', 'disturbing', 'memories', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'play', 'well', 'are', 'treated', 'numerous', 'flashbacks', 'mysterious', 'new', 'visitations', 'Aaron', 'long-dead', 'father', 'none', 'personal', 'stories', 'important', 'end', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'performance', 'Scarlet', 'Chorvat', 'younger', 'reporter', 'scheming', 'take', 'Dana', 'Elway', 'job', 'storyline', 'actually', 'seemed', 'make', 'little', 'bit', 'sense', 'really', 'weird', 'thing', 'Lost', 'Voyage', 'though', 'special', 'effects', 'Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'closing', 'scenes', 'movie', 'when', 'CGI', 'animation', 'suddenly', 'amuck', 'Many', 'climactic', 'scenes', 'look', 'kinds', 'animation', 'would', 'see', 'computer', 'gaming', 'console', 'game', 'game', 'would', 'be', 'impressive', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'disappointingly', 'fake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ever', 'seeing', 'movie', 'animation', 'suddenly', 'took', 'such', 'peculiar', 'look.The', 'real', 'source', 'weakness', 'movie', 'plot', 'Too', 'many', 'story', 'elements', 'are', 'introduced', 'apparent', 'reason', 'almost', 'nothing', 'fate', 'ghost', 'liner', 'revealed', 'end', 'movie', 'quite', 'disappointing', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'two', 'epilogue', 'sequences', 'make', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'only', 'serve', 'reinforce', 'failed', 'opportunities', 'seem', 'define', 'Lost', 'Voyage', 'problems', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'actually', 'hated', 'film', 'had', 'enough', 'potential', 'keep', 'interested', 'lot', 'potential', 'was', 'wasted', 'end']",N/A

712912,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00006FDA1,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[3, 3]","""Lost Voyage,"" starring Judd Nelson and Lance Henriksen, is a very well done B-movie.  It isn't quite as good as ""Ghostship,"" which is similar since both are about a cruise ship that vanishes and then pops up a few years later with a few ""stranded"" passengers.  Both films feature a shady salvage crew as well.  That's about where the comparisons stop.  ""Lost Voyage"" actually manages to be very enjoyable for the bulk of its duration.  However, the ending, like so many before me have stated, is just a little bit goofy and off-center.Nelson plays a likeable guy who is obsessed with the Bermuda Triangle and the ""Corona Queen,"" the ship that suddenly pops up out of nowhere and carried his parents to their demise back in 1972.  He uses plenty of neat little gadgets to track paranormal activity on the ship in hopes of finding out more about his parents' deaths and to assist a news team hoping to bank in on the spooky cruise ship.  Lance Henriksen, forever a staple of excellent B-cinema, turns in a wonderful performance as the captain of the salvage crew hoping to make a fast and fat buck off of the wreck.  The rest of the cast is comprised of unknowns who all manage to turn in pretty good performances.Things start to go bump in the night aboard the wreck, and the crew comes face-to-face with an abundance of creepy images and nightmarish visions that are intended to scare the viewer but don't quite make the cut.  As the body count rises, the survivors decide to get off of the ship as quick as they can.  This results in more deaths and an ending that just falls terribly flat.The special effects are hokey at times, especially in the ending, but they hold up well thanks to a decently written script with a reasonable plot.If you enjoyed ""Ghost Ship,"" you might want to give this flick a try.

Although some of the plotting is vague and undefined, the story manages to scare up a few jolts.

712916,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00006FDA1,Micheal Hunt,"[0, 2]","This movie came out around the same time as ""Ghostship"", and seeing as how it is only a cheapie, I payed out some pocket change and found it was better then expected!PLOTThe story is about a cruise ship that sets sail sometime in the 1960's and it is sucked into a mysterious storm and is never heard of again... At least... not until 25 years later when the boat mysteriously re-appears off an island in the Bermuda triangle.On the lost voyage a kids father and step mother where on it, and now 25 years later that same kid is grown up (Judd Nelson) who happens to be a paranormal researcher, and is talked into going on-board the ship with a reporter (Janet Gunn) who needs the scoop.Once on the ship they start to try and work out what happened and why, and what they discover is... well, watch the movie to find out.ReviewI found I liked this movie a lot more then Ghostship. I watched Ghostship and I really did not like the end of that movie, but this one sort of had the ending that I preferred. Tho, don't compare Ghostship to this movie, they are completely different stories. Judd Nelson (The breakfast club) & Lance Henrickson (Millennium) play out very convincing characters, as do most of the cast, but those 2 play off each other very well.The CGI effects I thought where not convincing at all, they looked too CGI rather then real, but however, you don't need great CGI effects to make a movie work, you need a good plot, a good cast and a good director/editor to make the film work... so they could of used tissues on strings for ghosts and I think the movie would still be enjoyable. I also just found out this was a made for TV movie, so that explains the low-budget CGI.BONUS STUFFI don't know if the region 1 DVD (USA) is the same as the region 4 DVD (Australia/UK), so forgive me if they're different.There is a featurette that's only worth a look at if you liked the movie, but it's nothing spectacular, there is also a filmography/bio of the cast and director... nothing much for the bonus section.Overall I think the movie is great. It's in widescreen and surround sound, the sound effects are ok, the CGI is laughable sometimes, but it doesn't matter. And I'd recommend this movie as a rental before paying any attention to reviewers dismissing it.Watch it if you liked Ghostship.",4,Lost Ship Returns From The Bermuda Triangle 25 Years Later,1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,2305,"['movie', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'Ghostship', 'seeing', 'how', 'only', 'cheapie', 'payed', 'out', 'pocket', 'change', 'found', 'was', 'better', 'then', 'expected', 'PLOTThe', 'story', 'cruise', 'ship', 'sail', 'sometime', '1960', 'sucked', 'mysterious', 'storm', 'never', 'heard', 'again', 'least', 'not', '25', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'boat', 'mysteriously', 'island', 'Bermuda', 'triangle.On', 'lost', 'voyage', 'kids', 'father', 'step', 'mother', 'where', 'now', '25', 'years', 'later', 'same', 'kid', 'grown', 'up', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'who', 'be', 'paranormal', 'researcher', 'talked', 'going', 'on-board', 'ship', 'reporter', 'Janet', 'Gunn', 'who', 'scoop.Once', 'ship', 'start', 'try', 'work', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'what', 'discover', 'well', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out.ReviewI', 'found', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'then', 'Ghostship', 'watched', 'Ghostship', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'sort', 'had', 'ending', 'preferred', 'Tho', 'do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'Ghostship', 'movie', 'are', 'completely', 'different', 'stories', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'breakfast', 'club', 'Lance', 'Henrickson', 'Millennium', 'play', 'out', 'very', 'convincing', 'characters', 'do', 'most', 'cast', '2', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'very', 'well.The', 'CGI', 'effects', 'thought', 'where', 'not', 'convincing', 'looked', 'too', 'CGI', 'rather', 'then', 'real', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'great', 'CGI', 'effects', 'make', 'movie', 'work', 'need', 'good', 'plot', 'good', 'cast', 'good', 'director/editor', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'so', 'could', 'used', 'tissues', 'strings', 'ghosts', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'also', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'low-budget', 'CGI.BONUS', 'STUFFI', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'region', '1', 'DVD', 'USA', 'same', 'region', '4', 'DVD', 'Australia/UK', 'so', 'forgive', ""'re"", 'featurette', 'only', 'worth', 'look', 'liked', 'movie', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'also', 'filmography/bio', 'cast', 'director', 'nothing', 'much', 'bonus', 'section.Overall', 'think', 'movie', 'great', 'widescreen', 'surround', 'sound', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'ok', 'CGI', 'laughable', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'matter', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'rental', 'paying', 'attention', 'reviewers', 'dismissing', 'it.Watch', 'liked', 'Ghostship']",N/A

Best ""Avid Reader""","[3, 4]","Imagine this: a ship returns 25 years after mysteriously disappearing into a ""portal"" to another dimension...dare I call it ""hell""?  Sound familiar?  Remember ""Event Horizon"" made in 1997?  Instead of a space craft, this flop of a film uses a cruise ship lost in the Bermuda Triangle as the premise.A local Florida TV news crew learns that a ship missing for 25 years has mysteriously reappeared. The TV station learns of this major media event and decides to investigate.  When the TV crew gets to the ship to board it in the waters off Bermuda (a major commercial shipping lane) there are amazingly no other parties seeking to get aboard...no Coast Guard, no Navy, no military intelligence, no other national media personnel, despite the fact that we are told the Coast Guard is keeping a very close eye on the ship to prevent illegal salvaging.Also on board with the news crew is a paranormal investigator who just happens to be the son of a couple lost 25 years earlier.  Needless to say, he has unresolved issues he wants resolved.  Judd Nelson (the investigator) acts like he's on valium and waiting rather impatiently for something to happen, like getting a paycheck so he can launch a lifeboat out of this film ASAP.But then, the ""evil"" on board starts to play with everyone's simple minds and ""scary"" events start to happen.  A rocking horse moves by itelf.  Oooooooo, I'm trembling with fright.  Mysterious, scary and uneffectively blue-lit faces appear on the camera monitors.  Aaaaaaaaaaah, save me from being scared out of my witless wits.  Shadowy and ominous forms dart quickly in the foreground...or background...depending on how unimaginitive the director chose to be on that specific day of shooting.  GASP!!!!!!  It took my breath away with grotesque shock...that such cliches are still thought of as frightening.Five deaths later, the two remaining survivors attempt to get off this barge and out of the film as quickly as possible, but are attacked by ghostly bodies of evil departed spirits floating around the ship like either shooting stars or pals of Caspar the Ghost.  Really? Really??  A horribly made film with such phenomenally bad CG effects that it should be avoided at all costs.

712919,A2MIO2RW0JE0C6,B00006FDA1,The Abominable Doctor Phibes,"[2, 2]","When I first discovered this DVD, I knew it didn't pass the ""smell test"" - it was obviously just a cheap knock-off riding the coat-tails of a major motion picture - 2002's ""Ghost Ship"" in this case. And yet I was intrigued by the promise of some guilty-pleasure viewing because I'm a sucker for haunted ship stories. Even the cheese-factor that goes with the territory of TV-grade productions is charming to me, too, in some way. It's as if these lower-budget filmmakers are underdogs, like AVIS (""We're #2, We Try Harder!""), and so I thought I'd don my life-vest and give it a spin. With my expectations set approximately on the ocean floor, the story should easily buoy itself above them. At least that was my hope.Turns out it boasts a decent cast - Judd Nelson and Lance Henriksen, in particular, who did a credible job with the material. The situation was set up nicely, there's actually some characterization and backstory of the Judd Nelson character, and the special effects, while obviously lower-grade CGI (synthetic rain, helicopters, ghostly apparitions, etc.) at least attempted to be convincing. The ship itself was just a sophisticated cartoon made in a computer, yet I found myself willing to go along for the voyage, suspension of disbelief in hand like a boarding pass.And so I permitted myself to enjoy the strong points of the movie, and was able to forgive the formulaic ""seen-it-a-thousand-times-before"" situations so I could pass a little time with Judd and Lance and the filmmakers. I was willing to be that ten year-old kid at the campfire, willing to be spooked by the storyteller, even if the tale being told had more holes than my tube socks. Funny how you can enjoy yourself when you want to - I think this piece succeeds for the small screen as disposable entertainment, and I recommend it for lovers of this sort of fare. While it doesn't deserve four stars, I'll admit I'm adding an extra star or two, as a flotation device, to keep it from sinking under the weight of harsher critics at Amazon.",4,"TV's Answer to ""Ghost Ship"" Exceeds Expectations",1247875200,"07 18, 2009",2009,2027,"['When', 'first', 'discovered', 'DVD', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'pass', 'smell', 'test', 'was', 'obviously', 'just', 'cheap', 'knock-off', 'riding', 'coat-tails', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', '2002', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'case', 'yet', 'was', 'intrigued', 'promise', 'guilty-pleasure', 'viewing', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'haunted', 'ship', 'stories', 'Even', 'cheese-factor', 'territory', 'TV-grade', 'productions', 'charming', 'too', 'way', 'lower-budget', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'underdogs', 'AVIS', ""'re"", '2', 'Try', 'Harder', 'so', 'thought', ""'d"", 'don', 'life-vest', 'give', 'spin', 'expectations', 'set', 'approximately', 'ocean', 'floor', 'story', 'should', 'easily', 'buoy', 'least', 'was', 'hope.Turns', 'out', 'decent', 'cast', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'particular', 'who', 'did', 'credible', 'job', 'material', 'situation', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'nicely', 'actually', 'characterization', 'backstory', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'character', 'special', 'effects', 'obviously', 'lower-grade', 'CGI', 'synthetic', 'rain', 'helicopters', 'ghostly', 'apparitions', 'etc', 'least', 'attempted', 'be', 'convincing', 'ship', 'was', 'just', 'sophisticated', 'cartoon', 'made', 'computer', 'found', 'willing', 'go', 'along', 'voyage', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'hand', 'boarding', 'pass.And', 'so', 'permitted', 'enjoy', 'strong', 'points', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'forgive', 'formulaic', 'seen-it-a-thousand-times-before', 'situations', 'could', 'pass', 'little', 'time', 'Judd', 'Lance', 'filmmakers', 'was', 'willing', 'be', 'ten', 'year-old', 'kid', 'campfire', 'willing', 'be', 'spooked', 'storyteller', 'even', 'tale', 'being', 'told', 'had', 'more', 'holes', 'tube', 'socks', 'Funny', 'how', 'can', 'enjoy', 'when', 'want', 'think', 'piece', 'small', 'screen', 'disposable', 'entertainment', 'recommend', 'lovers', 'sort', 'fare', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'four', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'adding', 'extra', 'star', 'two', 'flotation', 'device', 'keep', 'sinking', 'weight', 'harsher', 'critics', 'Amazon']",N/A
