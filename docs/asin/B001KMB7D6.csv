This is a good rollercoster type of story, full of somewhat unexpected things.  A girl drives home from a night on the town and had too much to drink.  When he loses control of her jeep it veers into a part of the nearby woods.  She seems to be lucky though and manages to drive home without getting into an accident.  But this isen't all that it seems, because without her actually noticing it, she hit a man while driving back home.  At first she dosent' notice a thing, but then when she feels that something is amiss she goes back to the garage where she parked her jeep, to find the body of a man who's severly injured.  She tried to help this man but all of a sudden he grabs her, apparently to seek his revenge for being hit by the girl.  The girl then panics and kills the man with a gulf club.  Since her parents are gone for the weekend she decided to hide the body in the nearby woods.  From here on the movie picks up speed and the suspense increases.

They have to make the viewer feel for the heroines' when they have gotten behind the wheel after too much to drink and hit someone. While Mary of this film seems likeable, once she made the mistake of getting behind the wheel, my concern for her was pancaked. Fortunately, her ridiculous choice was slightly redeemed after the man she hit turns out to be quite unhinged. This is not to say that it is good she hit the man... it isn't... and most everything that happened in the film could be blamed on her reckless habits.So, what starts out as a rather generic genre piece is rescued after she discovers that the man she thought she killed is actually not dead and he serves up a bit of frightening revenge. How, I don't want to reveal... but it was quite diabolical even if it really didn't really follow through with its promise of a gory finish.And then it had that ending... which was ok but not great when featured with the violent turbulence beforehand.

1208360,A23UGT76JP6PVX,B001KMB7D6,Gotham Night,"[4, 4]","I love scary movies.  And I finally had to write a review for this little gem, since I am watching it again tonight after having this movie in my possession for almost a year.  It's one of those movies that you watch when you just want to escape and be taken on a joy ride.  Where scary things happen  - to other people - and you can sit comfortably in your living room and go along with them as they try to get out of a terrible situation.  This movie is not Oscar material, but it wasn't meant to be.  We are invited to a day in the life of a spoiled rich teen out on spring break, drinking with her girlfriends and fending off her boyfriend for the night.  She drank too much and she is tired.  So she jumps in her jeep with the ridiculous headlights on the top and heads home.  She runs off the road after trying to avoid something in the road and has a bumpy few seconds of a ride, but all seems well so she continues on home.  Too bad she didn't inspect the car before going to bed.After viewing this movie as many times as I have, I have come to appreciate the skill of the young actress, Laura Breckenridge.  She gives an amazing, natural, and spontaneous performance.  The actor who plays the victim in this movie, is one of the creepiest villains I have come across in horror movies.  There is one scene where he is standing in the road, facing her jeep, and his visage is pure evil and insanity.  Scary stuff indeed.  I like the twists and turns this movie takes and I loved the ending, because by then all tables have turned.  I found it very believable and this is probably what makes it so horrible.  And fun.  I appreciate this movie for what it is - a very well made thriller, perfectly paced, that is meant to make you thankful that you aren't Mary.

The writers have some interesting ideas, but do not tie them together very well.  If having a sensible story matters, then you may be disappointed.On her way home after a night featuring some drinking, Mary Murdock (Laura Breckenridge) swerves off the road, and bumps along through some trees.  A little shaken, but apparently unhurt, Mary heads home.  Later, hearing something in the garage, she is shocked to discover a body impaled on her bumper.  Mary wants to help, but when the man grabs her, she panics and beats him with a golf club until he stops moving.Believing him dead, she hauls the body into the woods, and in a heavy rain, manages to bury it in a shallow muddy grave.  The victim is Timothy Emser (Kevin Corrigan), a teacher who is bipolar, and has been reported as missing.  Riddled with guilt, Mary confesses the deed to her boyfriend Rick (Christopher Shand) who is surprised, but willing to help her cover up.  When she decides to return to the grave to retrieve some incriminating evidence, she makes a grim discovery, and her world spins further out of control.  Things go completely off the charts, when Emser attacks Mary at home, chewing off part of her ear, and apparently stabbing her a couple of times.  Mary feels the wind in her face, as Emser checks in at home to see his worried wife (Megan Anderson), before heading out on the road one final time.Laura Breckenridge's performance is quite good, making the most of a script with many logical flaws, and an ending that is a physical impossibility.  What Mary does is fairly understandable, although she has a strange fetish about repairing her bumper.  After surviving the ordeal, instead of getting her wounds treated, she goes to get her Jeep fixed.Besides having a superhuman will to live, and burning desire for revenge, Emser must have a great sense of direction.  Although gravely injured, he is still able move, track Mary back to her home, and then attack.  With incredible stamina, the guy is also apparently a hell of a sprinter.Although delivering some scares, Hit And Run scores low marks for believability, and is definitely a lightweight entry in the horror genre.  If that's not an issue, then it probably rates at least a rental.",2,a hit and miss thriller . . .,1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,2352,"['Director', 'Edna', 'McCallion', 'Hit', 'Run', '2009', 'thrills', 'only', 'remote', 'semblance', 'credible', 'plot', 'writers', 'have', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'do', 'not', 'tie', 'together', 'very', 'well', 'having', 'sensible', 'story', 'matters', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed.On', 'way', 'home', 'night', 'featuring', 'drinking', 'Mary', 'Murdock', 'Laura', 'Breckenridge', 'road', 'bumps', 'trees', 'little', 'shaken', 'apparently', 'unhurt', 'Mary', 'home', 'Later', 'hearing', 'something', 'garage', 'shocked', 'discover', 'body', 'impaled', 'bumper', 'Mary', 'help', 'when', 'man', 'panics', 'beats', 'golf', 'club', 'moving.Believing', 'dead', 'hauls', 'body', 'woods', 'heavy', 'rain', 'bury', 'shallow', 'muddy', 'grave', 'victim', 'Timothy', 'Emser', 'Kevin', 'Corrigan', 'teacher', 'who', 'bipolar', 'been', 'reported', 'missing', 'Riddled', 'guilt', 'Mary', 'deed', 'boyfriend', 'Rick', 'Christopher', 'Shand', 'who', 'surprised', 'willing', 'help', 'cover', 'up', 'When', 'return', 'grave', 'retrieve', 'incriminating', 'evidence', 'grim', 'discovery', 'world', 'further', 'control', 'Things', 'go', 'completely', 'charts', 'when', 'Emser', 'Mary', 'home', 'chewing', 'off', 'part', 'ear', 'apparently', 'stabbing', 'couple', 'times', 'Mary', 'feels', 'wind', 'face', 'Emser', 'checks', 'home', 'see', 'worried', 'wife', 'Megan', 'Anderson', 'heading', 'out', 'road', 'one', 'final', 'time.Laura', 'Breckenridge', 'performance', 'quite', 'good', 'making', 'most', 'script', 'many', 'logical', 'flaws', 'ending', 'physical', 'impossibility', 'What', 'Mary', 'fairly', 'understandable', 'strange', 'fetish', 'repairing', 'bumper', 'surviving', 'ordeal', 'instead', 'getting', 'wounds', 'treated', 'get', 'Jeep', 'fixed.Besides', 'having', 'superhuman', 'will', 'live', 'burning', 'desire', 'revenge', 'Emser', 'must', 'have', 'great', 'sense', 'direction', 'gravely', 'injured', 'still', 'able', 'move', 'track', 'Mary', 'back', 'home', 'then', 'attack', 'incredible', 'stamina', 'guy', 'also', 'apparently', 'hell', 'sprinter.Although', 'delivering', 'scares', 'Hit', 'Run', 'scores', 'low', 'marks', 'believability', 'definitely', 'lightweight', 'entry', 'horror', 'genre', 'not', 'issue', 'then', 'probably', 'rates', 'least', 'rental']",Hit and Run
