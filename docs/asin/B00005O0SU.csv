He plays a bookish, nondescript paralegal by day in L.A. who starts moonlighting on his own time to shoot amateur tapes.  He hires prostitutes and an out of work actor to star in his films. When the expenses get too much for him, he interviews with Craig Wasson, a pornographic producer, in order to get financial backing.  That is where his hobby starts having serious repercussions. Wasson considers it part of the director's job to recruit young women, who come to Hollywood with stars in their eyes, into the porno industry and DeGood starts doing a lot of harm by trying to talk Kate, a nice young woman he meets, into doing adult films. DeGood is also seduced by an adult film star who wants to produce her own films with him doing the directing for her.  All in all this is a very intriguing idea that is well executed.  However, it is not Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights,"" which remains the definitive work on cinematically exposing the underside of the adult entertainment industry.  Anderson, however, was working with a much bigger budget and with an all star cast.  Writer-director Atchison does a very admirable job with this small indie film and it is well worth seeing.",4,Nerd in LA LA Land,1026432000,"07 12, 2002",2002,1360,"['Michael', 'DeGood', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'guy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'date', 'who', 'pornography', 'pornography', 'industry', 'cures', 'frustrations', 'women', 'bookish', 'nondescript', 'paralegal', 'day', 'L.A.', 'who', 'moonlighting', 'own', 'time', 'shoot', 'amateur', 'tapes', 'prostitutes', 'out', 'work', 'actor', 'star', 'films', 'When', 'expenses', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'Craig', 'Wasson', 'pornographic', 'producer', 'order', 'get', 'financial', 'backing', 'where', 'hobby', 'having', 'serious', 'repercussions', 'Wasson', 'part', 'director', 'job', 'recruit', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'eyes', 'porno', 'industry', 'DeGood', 'doing', 'lot', 'harm', 'trying', 'talk', 'Kate', 'nice', 'young', 'woman', 'doing', 'adult', 'films', 'DeGood', 'also', 'seduced', 'adult', 'film', 'star', 'who', 'produce', 'own', 'films', 'doing', 'directing', 'very', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'well', 'executed', 'However', 'not', 'Paul', 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'Boogie', 'Nights', 'definitive', 'work', 'cinematically', 'exposing', 'underside', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'Anderson', 'however', 'was', 'working', 'much', 'bigger', 'budget', 'star', 'cast', 'Writer-director', 'Atchison', 'very', 'admirable', 'job', 'small', 'indie', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",The Pornographer

671313,AFFVUZEGP1FDQ,B00005O0SU,"Morrigan Alexandros ""The Opinionated Me""","[1, 1]","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The movie is about a lonely man who works as a paralegal. He is addicted to porn and thinking he can do better, he starts making his own porn films. He is a highly idealistic and nave and become rapidly disappointed with the porn film industry and what is expected of him. The porn industry proves to be a unscrupulous, tough and immoral place for him. He tries to follow along to achieve his dream of making porn films. But, soon his failed dream, his work and what he must do to someone he does not want to hurt catches up to him.The film is very well made and surprising little nudity in the film. The director focused on the story and not on nudity or sex, which is what makes the film work. Had the director focused on sex, the story would have become secondary.

671314,A1K4VAYQQLNFVS,B00005O0SU,"""peterdao""","[11, 12]","Although its title may be misleading, ""The Pornographer"" presents us with a very interesting theme which stands out among thousands of Hollywood's cliche-filled screenplays. The dialogue, while not carrying any string of ""memorable lines"", is quite honest and delightful. When it comes to the inside look at the porn industry, however, this indie drama fails to offer a full, convincing picture (probably due to low budget and/or lack of experience). I particularly like Michael DeGood. His portrayal of a next door loser is no less impressive than Mark Wahlberg's characterization of an ambitious young guy in ""Boogie Nights"". Anyway, had (co-producer) Katheryn Cain tried harder in her acting, had Monique Parent spent some more time studying what Melanie Griffith did in ""Body Double"", this movie could be much more entertaining. All in all, not a waste of time.
