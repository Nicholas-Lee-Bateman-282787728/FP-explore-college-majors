1272985,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B002JVWRD6,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","More than twenty years ago, Walter Bishop set in motion a series of cataclysmic events by opening a doorway between this world and somewhere else. Those events have manifested as the Pattern, evidence of reality itself becoming malleable and where the rules of science have become less rigid. As Fringe Division continues its attempts to discover the secrets of the Pattern, the consequences of Walter's decision make themselves felt, with possible dire ramificationFringe's second season picks up moments after the ending of the first season, with Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) transported to another world. In an interesting dramatic choice, the writers do not immediately focus on Olivia's adventures on the other side, instead concentrating on the impact of her absence and unexpected reappearance on the more familiar characters. It's not until several episodes into the season that we get a flashback to the events of the Season 1 finale and learn more about what's going on. In the meantime, with the show wearing it's X-Files inspiration more blatantly than ever (for the first few episodes at least), our team have to face off against a group of shapeshifters from the other side.The second season of Fringe still unloads a few solid stand-alone stories to the audience (most notably a quarantine drama set in an office block ravaged by an unknown disease), but the focus is much more closely on the serialised elements relating to 'the other side', Walter and Peter's backstory, the experiments run on Olivia when she was a child and how much the megacorporation Massive Dynamic know about what's happening. We get a new recurring bad guy in the form of Thomas Jerome Newton (an amiably villainous performance by Sebastian Roche), whose opposition to the Fringe Division's efforts creates much of the tension for the season.As with the first season, the cast continues to deliver excellent performances, particularly Kirk Acevedo as FBI Agent Charlie Francis, who is given a meatier role in the opening and closing episodes of the season. The stand-out, of course, remains John Noble as Walter Bishop. His performance in the first season was already remarkable, but over the course of the second season it apotheosises onto the 'Patrick Stewart in Star Trek: The Next Generation' level of sheer dominance. Whether it's playing his traditional befuddled scientist role, lapsing into trauma at the memory of a two-decade old tragedy or temporarily regaining his old memories and becoming cold, arrogant and condescending, Noble plays his part to perfection, winning the audience's sympathy or, for his more morally dubious acts, at least their understanding.The season reaches a huge emotional and acting peak in Peter, the fifteenth episode of the season and a major 'gamechanger' of an episode. Told mostly in flashback (complete with a retro, 1980s style music and title sequence), it not only explains much of the series's backplot, but it also gives us a look at the man Walter used to be and establishes the motivations of several major characters in the show. This kicks off a run of high quality episodes which mess around with the established formula, including one episode that is a bizarre noir thriller (the result of Walter - on various substances - trying to tell a children's story) and another that is a solo adventure for Peter out in the backwoods of Washington State (and may be a homage to Twin Peaks). The season concludes with a two-part finale which is the most epic thing the show's ever done, featuring multiple castmembers in different roles, impressive visual-effects shots and the successful depiction of portraying a world that is familiar but different. The cliffhanger ending is a bit of a doozy as well.The season does have a bit of a stinker in Unearthed, easily the weakest episode of the show to date. It was produced as part of Season 1 and held back to the second, putting it out of continuity and also rather out of keeping with the rest of the show: outright ghostly possession seems a stretch too far for the show, which whilst flirting with the paranormal usually manages to provide at least an attempt at a pseudoscientific explanation for events. Luckily, the DVD and Blu-Ray release hides the episode in the 'special features' section, pleasing completists whilst also ensuring it isn't accidentally stumbled over whilst watching the main body of the season.Overall, the second season of Fringe (*****) takes the excellent cast and premise of the first season and boots it onto another level, with exceptional acting (especially from John 'Criminally Emmyless' Noble) and some clever, coherent storytelling.",5,Excellent and improves upon the already-great first season,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",2013,4655,"['More', 'twenty', 'years',

Just as well, I couldnt keep the suspense from kiling me episode to episode so a two seasons in a row dose has done me good.The Grass is not always greener on the other side. That is because John Nobles Prof.Walter Bishop has put the other side, in this case an alternate Earth Universe populated by, well us, living out our lives in a mirror image of our own, though with some major or minor differences,  in danger when his grief at loosing his son caused him to break the laws of physics to save his sons alternate also dying of a seemingly incurable disease, when his doppelganger failed to notice that he had found the cure and our Walter Bishop, watching thru what you might call Universe-ision, a device that allowed him to look in on events on the other side nailed the cure and then he opened a portal to that side and took his doubles son and brought him back to our side and saved his life, but couldn't bare to take him back.This action caused a rift in the wall between our Universes and all the horrible X-files/Outer Limits plague of horrible phenomena that have been occurring. At the core of the matter, only one Universe will survive in the end. Ours or theirs. They are more advanced Technologically speaking then us. There is the ZFT manual, written by ? that outlines a coming Alien holocaust not unlike the one envisioned by Alien Conspirators assisted by Cancer Man, but this time the enemy is our own selves but in another dimension.I cant and dont have the room or time to rant and rave about this show and give it the full accolades it deserves, suffice it to say that John Noble is the heart and soul of this show and is the catalyst that makes the other characters he interacts with more then just two dimensional sidekicks or colleagues. He brings a smile a laugh and often a tear to ones face when he delivers his lines. His casting here was sheer brilliance and whoever in the studio thought of him for the part deserved a raise and hearty well done.So who will win out? Their world is dying and they are getting desperate. Will Walter Bishop be able to regain his equilibrium and steadfastness after 17 years in the Mental Institution to face this challenge without his nerves unraveling in the face of what his brilliant mind brought about. Will Peter Bishop, whose life he saved and who is the only person Walter cares for and deeply loves and would gives his life for for, ever be able to come to terms and find peace about his whole past and realize that who you are born to dosent always determine who loves you the most as parent? Can nothing be done to avoid the collision of the Universes?  Which food will Walter remember next as being a favorite of his? Who are the Observers, why what and where are they all about, and whats with the spicy food obsession.Season 3 is here and some answers are forthcoming. Season 1, Episode 1, and you are hook line and sinker gonna become a fan and being of the old school Sci-fi movies and kind set in my ways, it says a lot about a series like this to hold my attention, oh and the wifes, Mrs Hallmark Channel, adores this show and John Noble as well.  I just hope that they dont make the same mistake as X-Files. A brilliant series, wonderful performances by Ducovney and Gillian, for which we have as of yet to get a closure on Alien Invasion theme. I hope this series dosent fall into that trap and realize more is not always better. 3 or 4 good seasons beats 7 meandering seasons anytime.",5,Where the heck have I been?

1273044,A1GXBMUTVHWHJL,B002JVWRD6,Flash,"[0, 1]","For me, the second season of Fringe didn't quite live up to the excellence of season one. I think the main reason is that the main characters came across as too involved in the causes of the problems between the two universe's. This is particularly true of Walter, where he seems to be involved in just about everything and in my opinion it's way too much of everything. I liked it much much better when the mysteries were outside these characters and THEY had to figure them out. All in all, still a good season with some above average episodes and the character development remains strong. The settings were a little more like the X-Files, such as in Northwest Passage, which also had a fun guest appearance from Martha Plimpton. I had wondered what had become of her. Episodes like Night of Desirable Objects and Snakehead were also similar in tone to an X-Files show. But I guess that leads to my final opinion of season 2. I liked the stand-alone episodes better than the story-arc episodes. The exact opposite was true in season 1. One episode, Brown Betty is a complete throwaway. Reminded me of a Star Trek Next Generation holodeck episode. Still, I have hopes that season 3 will be better.

This second season really finished the work started on the first by increasing the complexity of the episodes and adding depth to the characters' lives.  Even though some may object to the Peter and Olivia story line, I found it surprising (never was a ""shipper"" before, not even for Mulder and Scully, and I wasn't for these two either).  But then, it's not less surprising or refreshing to see how all the characters now solve mysteries using their brains, ideas and information, and not by logging into a search engine online and finding the answers there.  It is also stimulating to see episodes of the quality of ""Momentum Deferred"" and ""Jacksonville,"" in which all, Peter, Walter and Olivia, appear with unexpected layers of humanity for characters in a science-fiction drama.  I must admit that if after watching the first season I was quite interested, the second one just hooked me, reeled me in, made me an insomniac addict and took me back to the days in which I learned about science by watching some of the best sci-fi shows there were.  ""Fringe"" may have the ""Languave and violence"" warning, but it also needs one about ideas, creativity and unexpected twists that may leave the viewers scratching their heads or slack-jawed in disbelief.As other reviewers have pointed out, do not start watching this season when you have an early morning the following day.  It's impossible to watch just one episode when you have a disc chock-full of action, superb acting and challenging stories that are either new revelations or come from hints and details offered in season 1.

Unfortunately, it left me a bit underwhelmed - I sadly gave up on it after the first couple episodes.  A few months ago, at the urging of some friends who usually have excellent taste in TV, I decided to give it another go, having been told it gets better.  The first season does get much better, but it didn't quite hook me.  I lost steam again a few episodes into the second season - the mystery-of-the-week thing still wasn't doing it for me.Then earlier this week, at the urging of the same friends, I decided to pick back up where I left off - and I'm SO glad I did.  This show really starts building momentum about halfway through the second season, and I've been marathoning episodes every night this week until all hours of the morning. It turns its focus to our characters and their relationship to these strange events, rather than just the events themselves, which makes for a much more appealing serial narrative.  I've finished Season 2 and will start Season 3 as soon as I've posted this review. (I may be mildly obsessed.)So, I'd like to be that friend to you, to persuade you to persevere with this show, because it really is worth it.

Luckily, Fringe season 2 falls into the first category.  First, the shows enhancement of the mythology was great, the characters evolved, the story had a forward progression, and I never felt a twist was out of place or forced just for purposes of having a twist ending. I also like how the more the show progresses, the less black and white the good guys and bad guys are (don't want to put any spoilers, but when you watch, you'll see) As to the non-mythology episodes, they are just as good, and sometimes better than the mythology episodes, again as they address the characterization you don't find in most shows.  Which is what makes fringe so compelling.  There are a number of procedural dramas on tv (you know, opens with a mystery, and a large majority of the episode is solving that mystery), but none really emphasize characters like this one does, nor has such an interesting mythology.

For Nielsen viewers out there:  If you care about the show, please watch FRINGE LIVE! If you do not have time, turn your Nielsen box and TV ON at least while you are away (going out or working on Friday night).  You can DVR Fringe but it counts much more if you at least have the set top box and tv on thus counting as ""watching the show live"".  If you like to watch other shows at the Friday 9pm time slot please DVR those other shows as well and watch FRINGE LIVE!.  Keep in mind, those others shows, CSI NY or Supernatural are already renewed.  Fringe is still pending for renewal and may get cancelled if the 18-49 ratings are low, say 1.5 or lower.  Producers have mentioned it needs 5 to 7 seasons to tell the whole story.  So again please help!!2. For those who do not have a Nielsen box which are many of us and don't get counted, despite that it has a small effect it does help to watch it online on HULU or Fox's official Fringe website or Warner Brothers Fringe website (google it to find websites)3. Buy Fringe Products on DVD or Blu-ray now before season 3 ends in May 2011.  The more sales the better to have an impact on renewal.  Warner Brothers could charge a lesser fee to FOX (though of course don't know for sure) if sales are high enough with higher Blu-ray and DVD sales. Note: Warner Brothers owns Fringe and charges FOX a fee to broadcast the show.  Also Amazon online season purchase and iTunes season purchases help.The bottom line, FOX mostly if not all get money from Ad sales and the best way to get that money is from people watching live for the nielsen viewers.  No money from ad sales Fox will have no choice but to cancel it.  FOR MOST OF US WHO ARE NOT NIELSEN VIEWERS, the other means (or tips) do help even though not as much but help nonetheless.

And, it appears the writers and producers were fans of that seminal series trying to find the truth. :-)In Episode 1 of Season 2, within the first few minutes, as the &#34;shape shifter&#34;/&#34;super soldier&#34; (sound familiar?) modifies his shape for the first time (that we've seen), guess who is on the large screen TV in the victim's home? You guessed it... Fox Mulder, with Scully on the left but barely visible. It looked like an earlier episode from one of the first few seasons, produced in Vancouver. In fact, it could have been Episode 2 of Season 1.So, the parallels of these two terrific series are woven in very subtle ways. Since Fox owns the rights to both series, I would imagine they can do this without worrying about paying anyone for the rights, but Chris Carter and the rest, especially David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, likely received a few bucks for showing their images and premise. Fringe and Abrams have just taken it to a new level. Still the FBI. Still a rogue division which is shut down, then resurrected. Still being controlled by a govt. committee (the Senate committee seen in episode 2 of Season 2). In fact, one of the Senators is an actor who was involved in controlling and then later shooting the FBI director who recruited Scully into the X-Files project to watch Mulder. I found that humorous and am looking forward to the rest of the series.

1273159,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B002JVWRD6,Patrick Correa,"[0, 0]","I loved the first season of Fringe but the second season was bit of a mixed bag.  Okay, most of the episodes were good, and enough of them were really good, but the bad ones were awful.  Here&#8217;s a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from the booklet.  I&#8217;m listing the episodes in the way the DVD has them, but I recommend watching the last one first.  That&#8217;s what I did because of a spoiler I read.21.  A New Day In The Old Town:  Grievously injured in a freakish accident, Olivia is hunted by a shapeshifter who is connected to experiments Walter made in the 1970s.  How could anyone like this episode?  The story is confusing & the characters act stupidly.  This was so bad it made my father want to stop watching the show.  To be honest, it does mess up the flow of myth arc for a bit.  D-22.  Night of Desirable Objects:  A mysterious hand grabs a Pennsylvania construction worker and pulls him into an underground labyrinth of desiccated corpses.  A bit better, but it&#8217;s still pretty stupid.  The only real highlight is one of the scariest monsters of the week.  D+23.  Fracture:  Responding to a sinister call, a cop turns himself into a human bomb.  The team traces the cause back to a secret military experiment in Iraq.  Now this is more like it.  I love any episode where the Observers play a big role.  A+24.  Momentum Deferred:  Someone&#8217;s stealing frozen heads from cryonics labs.  And Olivia has a shocking breakthrough in her attempt to regain her memory.  And it&#8217;s back to stupid stories.  I rank this one a bit higher because we finally got to see Olivia&#8217;s conversation with William Bell.  C-25.  Dream Logic:  A sleep researcher&#8217;s patients begin to dream while awake &#8211; dreams that drive them to homicide.  It&#8217;s back to quality episodes for a bit.  A26.  Earthling:  When a man dissolves into ashes, everyone on the team is astonished&#8230;except Broyles, who has seen the phenomena before.  This reminded me of the X-Files episode Space, except done several dozen times better.  B+27.  Of Human Action:  Kidnappers grab the son of a Massive Dynamics scientist.  And anyone who interferes develops a sudden mania for self-destruction.  This reminded me of 2 X-files epsiodes (Eve & Pusher).  I mean that in a good way.  A28.  August:  Walter&#8217;s attention is focused on two topics:  the perfect milkshake and multiple Observers with murder on their minds.  Again, Observers equal excellent episodes, for the most part.  A+29.  Snakehead:  A terrified passenger survives a Chinese ship disaster.  And so does the tentacle beast who&#8217;s hitched a ride inside the passenger.  And we get a so-so filler episode.  C30.  Grey Matters:  One of the stolen cryogenics-lab heads returns, complete with a body, a knack for neurosurgery and a link to Walter&#8217;s past.  The last of the bad episodes for this season.  C31.  Johari Window:  Edina, New York, is a small town with a big secret &#8211; a secret its citizens will kill to protect.  More filler, but its decent filler if you ask me.  B32.  What Lies Below:  A contagion that ruptures its victims&#8217; veins quarantines Olivia and Peter in a Boston high-rise.  Pretty good.  B+33.  The Bishop Revival:  When wedding guests suffer bizarre deaths, Walter traces the cause to Josef Mengele &#8211; Auschwitz&#8217;s Angel of Death &#8211; and his own family.  And we come to a string of quality episodes that will last until the end of the season.  A34.  Jacksonville:  An earthquake melds a building and the people inside from our universe with a building from the other side.  The myth arc is back on track.  A+35.  Peter:  Flashbacks to 1985 reveal the secret of Peter&#8217;s past.  One of the best episodes ever.  Does anyone else think the 80s version of the opening is better than the regular one? A+36.  Olivia.  In The Lab.  With The Revolver:  To help trace a man with the touch of death, Walter bakes a patch of human skin.  Another great episode.  A37.  White Tulip:  Can one man change the past without consequences?  Time is mutable for a disturbed MIT professor who has a lot in common with Walter.  One of the most powerful episodes of the whole series.  A+38.  The Man From The Other Side:  A bridge on the Charles River is ground zero for the arrival of a man from the other side &#8211; and for Peter&#8217;s epiphany about his childhood.  A39.  Brown Betty:  Walter tells Ella a &#8216;40s detective story teeming with dark passions, shadowy motives and familiar faces.  A very fun episode.  A40.  Northwest Passage:  A small-town waitress doesn&#8217;t show up for her date with Peter.  But she has a good reason: she&#8217;s dead.  And a section of her brain has gone missing.  An excellent spotlight for Peter.  A+41-42.  Over There:  In the alternate universe, the other Fringe team detects aliens in their midst:  Olivia, Walter and three unexpected comrades who&#8217;ve crossed over.  To get back to their world, Walter and Bell must work together.  Without spoiling anything, I loved this episode until the end of part 2.  If it weren&#8217;t for that, it would have been an A+ episode easily.  A43.  Unearthed:  A teenage girl awakens after an accident leaves her brain-dead&#8230; but now she starts reciting submarine launch codes in Russian.  There&#8217;s a reason this episode was a leftover from season 1, it was the worst episode of the season.  It&#8217;s not horrible; some of the scenes are very effective, but it&#8217;s not memorable.  CBefore I give my overall opinion of this season, let me discuss what was so bad about the first episode.  I got the first season to try & enjoyed every episode.  Eventually, my whole family got hooked.  But then we watched the first episode of season 2... We all thought it was horrible.  We had so many problems with it.  Olivia's amnesia was way too convenient, and wouldn't Nina Sharp have known where she went & made sure she got back safely?  Wouldn't they have protected her when she was in the hospital?  And if you saw bullets did no harm to someone, would ANYONE split up & go hunting for them?  And finally, how does that dang switcheroo with Charlie work?  The killer prepared that room especially knowing someone would come down there?  Would they not check Charlie's mouth just to make sure it's Charlie?  Like I said, it put my father off of the show for a while though the rest of us continued to watch it.  He did get sucked back in, but was just as disappointed with the end of this season as I was.  But despite the rough start & the stupid twist at the end, I&#8217;m glad I stuck through.  The 16 good episodes were rewarding, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to like season 3 as much as the first 2.  This is going to be like Heroes, isn&#8217;t it?  It gets less rewarding every season until I&#8217;m glad to see it go.  I happened to get the 3rd season just before I finished this, so time will tell.",5,"Schizophrenic, but worthwhile.

1273188,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B002JVWRD6,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[0, 1]","The one thing Fringe has done the best so far is in helping me to fall asleep. My weird computer freak neighbor told me that he and his wife were enjoying Fringe. I saw season two at Walmart for about 12 dollars so I thought I'd give it a chance. I didn't see season one and I picked the show up in the middle, so I'm sure I missed a lot of what the show was about. Anyway, here goes my limited review.The actor who portrays Walter is probably the most talented of the cast. I am constantly impressed and annoyed by the character that this actor portrays. And I think the actor does a fantastic job of helping to act out a very confused and quirky man who is missing parts of his brain. This actor is the foundation of the show.The guy who plays Peter is ugly. When they do closeups I am aghast at just how ugly the man is. I'm not saying I need handome male actors and beautiful women, I don't, but ugly is ugly and hard to look at is just that. That said, the actor who plays Peter must have watched a lot of ER or other George Clooney shows. I swear when Peter speaks that I am listening to George Clooney. This actor delivers his lines well enough it's just that I feel I am listening to George Clooney.The blonde girl is also a little bit on the weird looking side. I think she is a boring character. But then too some times I like to look at her. She is different and that's about all I can say. She isn't great and she isn't bad. She's just there acting.What was up with the Massive Dynamic white lady kissing the black guy who works with the Fringe group? I'm like, WTF was that for? Maybe season one could explain that kiss? And I don't like the black guy's voice. He sounds so harsh.The black girl back at the lab seems to be there just for comedy relief. She is at least kind of cute or at least she is normal looking.The climax of this season has that gal's double coming back into, let's call it Earth 1. That was all just too unbelievable that no one thought that this girl might be the double from Earth 2.And I couldn't watch the one episode where Walter was telling a story.

1273208,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,B002JVWRD6,Sean Curley,"[0, 1]","The first season of J. J. Abrams' sci-fi drama series ""Fringe"" showed considerable promise, even as its more mundane procedural elements did not quite have the level of success of some of Abrams' earlier series (""Alias"", for instance, a personal favourite of mine).  The strongest elements pertained to the series' emergent myth arc, which takes centre stage much more this season, marking a considerable improvement in quality and validating the potential that was evident in the first season.  Spoilers follow.Season One concluded with the interdimensional meeting of Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv, who continues to do amazing work here) and the mysterious Dr. William Bell (incarnated in the fan-pleasing form of sci-fi legend Leonard Nimoy).  Bell sends Olivia back to our world with a warning about the shapeshifting soldiers sent to infiltrate it.  Over the course of the season, the conflict between the two sides continually escalates, and more of the Fringe cases tie in to this developing war of the worlds.However, the real centrepiece of the season is the gradual revelation of the true history of Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson).  In my review of the first season, I noted that his character often seemed to lack a real part in the procedural elements of the series.  This changes here, as he becomes much, much more important, though this tends to centre mostly around how Olivia and especially his father Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) are affected by the secret of his origin.

So many of the Fringe story lines that at first appear to lead down the proverbial rabbit-hole, are, by the final season, all neatly woven together where everything is explained; we even learn who really was responsible for the events that Walter thinks were cause by him alone. What makes this series so compelling is the outstanding acting - especially that of John Noble. His portrayal of the &#34;not-all-there&#34; Walter Bishop and the alternate Walter is amazing to behold. Why he was never nominated for an Emmy I will never understand other than to say that for some shortsighted reason Hollywood has never given science fiction its due and has summarily dismissed any acting in that genre out-of-hand. In the final episode of season 5, there is a scene between Walter and Peter that is as poignant as any one might find in a reel of Oscar winning performances. There are so few programs on television that take the risk of telling a story so &#34;out-of-the-box&#34; - it is refreshing to see one make it all the way to the finish line and to do it so well.

It all begins with a car and it all ends with a startling revelation coming to a head and forgiveness being asked for by someone that this viewer has come to love. The oddity, the bizarre people and the reasons behind everything: sometimes you think you are going to be doused with filler, only to find out you've actually unlocked a piece to the puzzle.When you look at J.J.'s work, you notice how things are brought together for a reason. I like that, and I like the way that the mind can boggle at some of the twists and the turns that happen right under your nose. From Peter and the past that Walter did not ever want revealed to the Olivia that we did not know about so clearly in the past but have now come to understand, the show plays connect-the-dots well. It also delves into other subjects, addressing spirituality, the concept of love, forgiveness, and a drove of other items. These are things you don't expect from shows but find yourself handling, exploring, and needing in DVD form. Otherwise, you might miss out on something - and that would be a travesty.Aside from the storytelling aspect of Fringe, there are the great actors that are evolving on the set. We have our four main cast members, a boss we have come to explore, a lady with secrets that seem bigger than the company she has, and even the scientist that works for her. all of these little cogs play their parts and play them well - otherwise the show wouldn't be what it is. There is a dynamic at play here, sometimes funny in the most bleak situations, and I have to say that I really love that. I also love the progressive idea moving through the show and the things that could happen if certain factions manage undo what people know as reality.If only we could know what the Watchers know.If you have not seen the show, stop and go get Season 1 now. If you thought Season 1 was anything but grand, continue here and find yourself inspired. I loved the show when it first came out and now, with the signing of two more seasons at least, we know it will have time to develop. so, get the episodes, the parts you missed out on because of cuts, the commentary, and everything else this DVD offers.

Some older fans couldn't relate to the twenty-something characters of ""Supernatural"" so ""Fringe"" became a perfect escape from fans looking for the same mystery/science fiction/suspense elements with characters that skew from the young to the old.The Blu-ray transfers look extremely good although there are some minor issues with image quality due to the number of episodes per disc and there isn't a lossless soundtrack included (why Warner hasn't done this with their newer TV shows I'm not sure). Extras are terrific with six commentary tracks as well as assorted other extras (more details below).""Fringe"" Co-creator and executive producer J.J. Abrams learned the lesson of carrying on a convoluted story arc too long and making up the story as they went along with Chris Carter's ""The X-Files"" unsatisfying conclusion after 9 seasons. Abrams sets up season long b-story arcs that are usually resolved within the season and has (so far) given answers to the A story elements over the course of a season as well (something that began with ""Lost"" even though that show also had for me an unsatisfying and somewhat predictable conclusion).The second season built on the momentum of the first--the outbreaks related to ""fringe"" science continue such as a virus that causes the skin to cover all orifices smothering the victim or buildings from an alternate universe colliding with those of our own. We discovered during season two (SPOILERS FOLLOW)that the war between the our universe and the alternate universe was spurred by Walter going to the other side to save Walternate's son after Walter's son had died. Walter brought back Peter from the other dimension and raised him as his own. Walternate who became the scientific thought leader in his universe began the war with us and also the Secretary (of Defense one can only assume) allowing him to develop and sent shape shifting terrorists to our side to wreck havoc. Walter also wants Peter back for his own insidious purposes outside of the fact that Peter is his son.Although there are often lapses of logic (and really very little ""real"" science not that it matters since ""Fringe"" is really a horror/science fiction hybrid much as ""The X-Files"" was)in the story telling department (most viewers don't notice simply because they get caught up in the action of the episode), ""Fringe"" is to be applauded for its strong performances, direction, production values and, yes, writing taking chances that few other TV shows will do (the only other series that is better than ""Fringe"" in that department is the horror TV show ""Supernatural"" where creator/producer Eric Kripke rarely leaves illogical ideas left dangling) and does it well.**END OF SPOILERS**As with the first season the performances are uniformly strong (although I did miss the character of Charlie who was sacrificed as a series regular due to budget/narrative issues--the writers didn't really know what to do with his character after the first season (fear not Charlie fans he ""returns"" sort of). The season cliffhanger for ""Fringe"" was a dozy (and if you haven't seen it avoid reading any spoilers) although it might have been predictable it was executed fairly well even if, again, there was a gaping plot hole in the final episode that wasn't adequately addressed but, again, the show managed to slide past it due to deft direction, action and performances. Like ""The X-Files"" the stand-alone episodes are usually as strong as the alternate universe war driven episodes and while it helps to have seen the first season most viewers could comfortably watch the second season episodes without missing too much.As with the first season Warner has done an exceptionally good job of translating ""Fringe"" to Blu-ray. Blacks are nice throughout--inky, deep and rich and the Blu-ray doesn't suffer from the crushed blacks that plague other TV shows that are transferred to DVD or Blu-ray. Detail is remarkably crisp throughout and the slightly bleached color scheme that is a hallmark of the series arrives intact without anyone boosting the color or contrast.There is occasional noticeable video noise that appears which does muddy up the episodes scenes that might consume a higher bit rate due to the darkness, action, grain etc.  It's not a huge issue but given how great season one looked and was delivered, it is a little bit of a letdown marring what otherwise is a good looking show. It's particularly noticeable on larger monitors but those watching it on their computer or a plasma (or LCD) smaller than 35 inches probably won't notice it all that much. Still, the presentation IS exceptionally good and it's a minor criticism.Audio sounds remarkably good throughout with a nice sounding  presentation in 5.1 although it ISN'T presented in the lossless format.  Although surround speakers aren't quite as active as, say, a theatrical action movie they are darn close with plenty of detail measured out among speakers particularly during action sequences but there is still subtle elements you can hear in the surround channels even during the quieter, dialog driven scenes of the show.The first Blu-ray and DVD set was loaded with special features including mini-featurettes focusing on visual effects and other elements that were important to key episodes. The second season carries that over.""Analyzing the Scene"" provides us with good, brief insights into the production of six key episodes from the second season. ""A New Day in the Old Town"", ""Momentum Deferred"", ""Of Human Action"", ""What Lies Below"", ""Brown Betty"" and ""Over There"" are highlighted.We also get four audio commentaries all of which are pretty informative even if the heavy hitting stars are absent for most of them. It is nice though to get a different practical perspective on the production of the episodes so kudos to Warner for trying something a bit different.Actors John Noble and Blair Brown appear on one commentary track and they are engaging, entertaining and have lots of trivia about shooting the episode. ""Over There, Part 2"" which features the producers/writers Jeff Pinkner, Akiva Goldsman and J.H. Wyman clearly are having a good time watching the episode but it doesn't result in a very informative commentary track.We also get the ""Unearthed Episode"" that was originally from season one but was curiously aired during season two. This stand alone episode was deemed to be somewhat pedestrian compare to other episodes during season one and was held back for that reason. When it ran it was during the middle of the second season luckily here it is presented out of the aired order as a special feature on disc four.We also get six deleted scenes from six key episodes. We also get a gag reel.""Beyond the Pattern"" is nearly a half hour and gives us background on the developing mythology of the series and ""In the Lab"" lets us see a number of the props onset with actor John Noble and prop master Rob Smith acting as our guides.The second season of ""Fringe"" was even more engaging than the first and while there were still some episodes that weren't quite up to snuff the quality is consistently high for the most part. The extras are quite good for the show although I do lament Warner taking the cheap route and putting the entire season run and extras on four discs instead five like the first season. It would also be nice to see Warner give the audio on this series the lossless audio presentation they deserve but, I suspect, they think most folks are going to watch this on their PC using a smaller audio system that wouldn't benefit from it. Despite some minor flaws, I'd recommend the second season of ""Fringe"".",4,"""Fringe"" remains on the cutting edge of TV shows with a stronger season 2",1284768000,"09 18, 2010",2010,8290,"['PLEASE',

1273268,AP3B615GM191G,B002JVWRD6,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[57, 67]","For many avid TV watches, the series finale of LOST in May of 2010 tore a hole in their silver-screen world that one could drive a truck through.  Shows like ""V"" and ""Flashforward"" have been heavily advertised as ABC's ""new alternatives"" to LOST, but neither has even remotely captured the imagination of the viewing audience.  Fortunately, FOX has found a gem (once again from mastermind creator JJ Abrams) with ""Fringe"", the only network-TV show on the airwaves right now that can be deemed a worthy successor to ""the Island"".Though the first half of ""Fringe: Season One"" was quite slow (almost to the point of boring), it really picked up the pace down the home stretch and, by the season one finale, was absolutely incredible.  This second season doesn't backpedal whatsoever, continuing to provide entertaining, mind-bending fiction week after week.For a basic season summary, all three of the primary characters have their own unique storylines that play out in tangent as the season progresses:-Walter Bishop, the mad scientist turned mental patient turned eccentric scientist, grapples with the horrible things he did as a young man, and how he can ever begin to rectify himself for those actions.-Peter Bishop, Walter's son, begins to realize the reason why large portions of his youth are unremembered, as he starts to piece together the fact that his familial roots may not exactly be from ""around here"".-Olivia Dunham, lead FBI agent, also deals with the demons of Dr. Bishop's past, as she finds out that, as a child, she took part in one of his more large-scale experiments, which left her with strange abilities that she debates the merit of developing.Of course, while each character goes through those personal battles, they still continue to investigate the mind-bending ""fringe science"" phenomena that the show is known for.  I look at the show as a combination of The X-Files (for its investigative setting) and LOST (extremely ambitious plot angles that never fail to give you an emotional payoff).Thus, if you are a bit ""lost"" after your favorite island castaways departed, give this JJ Abrams effort a look-see.  It just may give you something to look forward to again next fall.",5,And Your New LOST Substitute Is...,1274832000,"05 26, 2010",2010,2202,"['many', 'avid', 'TV', 'watches', 'series', 'finale', 'LOST', 'May', '2010', 'hole', 'silver-screen', 'world', 'one', 'could', 'drive', 'truck', 'Shows', 'V', 'Flashforward', 'have', 'been', 'heavily', 'advertised', 'ABC', 'new', 'alternatives', 'LOST', 'even', 'remotely', 'captured', 'imagination', 'viewing', 'audience', 'Fortunately', 'FOX', 'found', 'gem', 'once', 'again', 'mastermind', 'creator', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'Fringe', 'only', 'network-TV', 'show', 'airwaves', 'right', 'now', 'can', 'be', 'deemed', 'worthy', 'successor', 'Island', 'first', 'half', 'Fringe', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'quite', 'slow', 'almost', 'point', 'boring', 'really', 'picked', 'up', 'pace', 'down', 'home', 'stretch', 'season', 'one', 'finale', 'was', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'second', 'season', ""n't"", 'backpedal', 'whatsoever', 'continuing', 'provide', 'entertaining', 'mind-bending', 'fiction', 'week', 'week.For', 'basic', 'season', 'summary', 'three', 'primary', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'unique', 'storylines', 'play', 'out', 'tangent', 'season', '-Walter', 'Bishop', 'mad', 'scientist', 'turned', 'mental', 'patient', 'turned', 'eccentric', 'scientist', 'grapples', 'horrible', 'things', 'did', 'young', 'man', 'how', 'can', 'ever', 'begin', 'rectify', 'actions.-Peter', 'Bishop', 'Walter', 'son', 'realize', 'reason', 'why', 'large', 'portions', 'youth', 'are', 'unremembered', 'piece', 'together', 'fact', 'familial', 'roots', 'may', 'not', 'exactly', 'be', 'here', '.-Olivia', 'Dunham', 'lead', 'FBI', 'agent', 'also', 'demons', 'Dr.', 'Bishop', 'past', 'out', 'that', 'child', 'took', 'part', 'one', 'more', 'large-scale', 'experiments', 'left', 'strange', 'abilities', 'merit', 'developing.Of', 'course', 'character', 'personal', 'battles', 'still', 'continue', 'investigate', 'mind-bending', 'fringe', 'science', 'phenomena', 'show', 'known', 'look', 'show', 'combination', 'X-Files', 'investigative', 'setting', 'LOST', 'extremely', 'ambitious', 'plot', 'angles', 'never', 'fail', 'give', 'emotional', 'payoff', '.Thus', 'are', 'bit', 'lost', 'favorite', 'island', 'castaways', 'departed', 'give', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'effort', 'look-see', 'just', 'may', 'give', 'something', 'look', 'forward', 'again', 'next', 'fall']",N/A
1273269,AJD9EA658HCFW,B002JVWRD6,zck7592,"[4, 6]","Coming off of the explosive season 1 finale, season 2 has a lot to live up to. When season 1 first aired, it was slow but then built to the season finale.What I really like about this season is that there is only one questionable episode in the whole season, which was the spin off of Glee. Otherwise every other episode was great and interesting.Without giving away many spoilers, I will just give a general review of season 2.Season 2 of Fringe picks up where season 1 ends, where Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) is in the alternate universe.Season 2 also has a larger focus on the character of Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), in which he basically turns into the star of the show.Another positive, is that we see William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) in more episodes.Fringe is often compared to ""The X-Files"", which is very understandable. With this being said, I would say that Fringe season 2 compares to season 6 of ""The X-Files""If you are a fan of Fringe or lost interest in season 1, I strongly recommend you watch season 2, as there really is not a bad episode in the season.",5,"Takes a step closer to matching ""The X-Files"" with every season",1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,1069,"['Coming', 'explosive', 'season', '1', 'finale', 'season', '2', 'lot', 'live', 'up', 'When', 'season', '1', 'first', 'aired', 'was', 'slow', 'then', 'built', 'season', 'finale.What', 'really', 'like', 'season', 'only', 'one', 'questionable', 'episode', 'whole', 'season', 'was', 'spin', 'Glee', 'Otherwise', 'other', 'episode', 'was', 'great', 'interesting.Without', 'giving', 'away', 'many', 'spoilers', 'will', 'just', 'give', 'general', 'review', 'season', '2.Season', '2', 'Fringe', 'up', 'where', 'season', '1', 'ends', 'where', 'Olivia', 'Dunham', 'Anna', 'Torv', 'alternate', 'universe.Season', '2', 'also', 'larger', 'focus', 'character', 'Peter', 'Bishop', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'basically', 'star', 'show.Another', 'positive', 'see', 'William', 'Bell', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'more', 'episodes.Fringe', 'often', 'compared', 'X-Files', 'very', 'understandable', 'being', 'said', 'would', 'say', 'Fringe', 'season', '2', 'season', '6', 'X-Files', 'are', 'fan', 'Fringe', 'lost', 'interest', 'season', '1', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'watch', 'season', '2', 'really', 'not', 'bad', 'episode', 'season']",N/A
