But is is good enough to garner the Oscars for Best Film & Director. Absolutely! However, since the Academy has never awarded the Best Director statuette to a woman in the past, the odds are truly against Kathryn Bigelow. However, if it's to happen, then this is the film to bring it off. It's an exceptional piece of film making in every aspect. Great story, great cinematography, great acting, & exceptional directing. Bigelow brings it all together beautifully. It's simply the best war film I've seen since Full Metal Jacket. There's none of the patriotic graveside scenes that spoilt Saving Private Ryan, & none of the extreme blood & gore scenes so prevalent in most of the recently made war films. Amazingly, they have managed to produce a brilliant war film, that presents the horror & dangers of war, without the endless blood-letting.

After watching it however, I can't see why.There have been alot of war movies over the years, but there has yet to be anything worthwhile watching for Iraq.  This is not Platoon, the Dirty Dozen, the Battle of the Bulge, it isn't even Inglorious Basterds.  True, other Iraq fair has fallen flat or just plain sucked.  This wasn't as bad (Over There) and didn't have an idiotic and misguided political statement (Redacted...Marc Cuban burn in hell) but it wasn't all that good.There's the typical military irregularities, such as uniforms (US flags are worn on the right shoulder of soldiers but in the movie they're either on both or none), equipment (magazines disappear and reappear between scenes, and the 6 wheeled APC used by US soldiers is in fact an APC used by the South Africans, not Americans) and overall impossible situations (a single vehicle by itself? REALLY?).  These SERIOUSLY detract from the movie, so anyone not familiar with anything military get a somewhat twisted inaccurate view of operations in country.The storyline overall really has no point, as all it is are daily missions, almost vignettes, of the EOD team's daily ops.The last 15 minutes is the only thing that saves this movie and gives it a star.  the acting, emotion and theme (I won't spoil it) would've made this an AMAZING movie, had it been a constant throughout.  Sure, there's small snippets of emotion and feeling, but at times too brief to really feel it.Yes, I can see this movie receiving some nominations, such as best actor for Jeremy Renner, but to win it I think is a bit much.  As an active duty soldier with over 8 years service and 2 deployments, this movie just seemed lackluster and some of the situations too far fetched to really appreciate the movie, although it wasn't the total crapfest of other movies (Home of the Brave)",2,"Disappointing, far fetched, and a tad aggravating",1263254400,"01 12, 2010",2010,1968,"['wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'really', 'really', 'did', 'had', 'seen', 'read', 'alot', 'hype', 'rave', 'reviews', 'alot', 'talk', 'Oscars', 'watching', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why.There', 'have', 'been', 'alot', 'war', 'movies', 'years', 'there', 'yet', 'be', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'watching', 'Iraq', 'not', 'Platoon', 'Dirty', 'Dozen', 'Battle', 'Bulge', ""n't"", 'even', 'Inglorious', 'Basterds', 'True', 'other', 'Iraq', 'fair', 'fallen', 'flat', 'just', 'plain', 'sucked', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'idiotic', 'misguided', 'political', 'statement', 'Redacted', 'Marc', 'Cuban', 'burn', 'hell', 'was', ""n't"", 'typical', 'military', 'irregularities', 'such', 'uniforms', 'US', 'flags', 'are', 'worn', 'right', 'shoulder', 'soldiers', 'movie', ""'re"", 'none', 'equipment', 'magazines', 'disappear', 'reappear', 'scenes', '6', 'wheeled', 'APC', 'used', 'US', 'soldiers', 'fact', 'APC', 'used', 'South', 'Africans', 'not', 'Americans', 'overall', 'impossible', 'situations', 'single', 'vehicle', 'REALLY', 'SERIOUSLY', 'detract', 'movie', 'so', 'anyone', 'not', 'familiar', 'anything', 'military', 'get', 'somewhat', 'twisted', 'inaccurate', 'view', 'operations', 'country.The', 'storyline', 'overall', 'really', 'point', 'are', 'daily', 'missions', 'almost', 'vignettes', 'EOD', 'team', 'daily', 'ops.The', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'star', 'acting', 'emotion', 'theme', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'AMAZING', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'constant', 'Sure', 'small', 'snippets', 'emotion', 'feeling', 'times', 'too', 'brief', 'really', 'feel', 'it.Yes', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'receiving', 'nominations', 'such', 'best', 'actor', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'win', 'think', 'bit', 'much', 'active', 'duty', 'soldier', '8', 'years', 'service', '2', 'deployments', 'movie', 'just', 'seemed', 'lackluster', 'situations', 'too', 'far', 'fetched', 'really', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'total', 'crapfest', 'other', 'movies', 'Home', 'Brave']",N/A

Goats roam in the streets. A wheel falls off a cart, a soldier dresses in protective gear to inspect the bomb. A man fingers a cell phone, the bomb explodes. A package is sealed for shipping. We see another patrol on the streets to check for a reported bomb. A car goes past the troops, then stops. The soldier disarms the fuse on the bomb. But there are six more! They are disarmed. Some soldiers play video games. Peddlers sell DVDs. Later there is another car to inspect. A shot causes a fire. ""He's not going to make it."" The truck is filled with 155mm shells. The wires are cut. He searches for the main fuse and cuts it. ""873!""There is talk with an advisor. There's more drama at an explosion site. They find four armed men with an SUV in the desert. There is an ambush! A sniper hits soldiers from a distance. Can they reach him? A jammed magazine is cleared. They wait to aim again. One soldier spots an insurgent crawling along the bridge by the goats. They later relax with rough humor. The specialist collects souvenirs. The conversation reveals their past lives. [Does loneliness cause drinking?] The Colonel goes for a ride. They search an abandoned building. They find a load of explosives and a dead body. ""What is he doing?"" A bomb hits the Colonel! Could a DVD merchant be a spy for the insurgents?The specialist gets a ride to a house. Who was responsible for ""Beckham""? He flees the house. James is summoned for a new mission. People flee from a ""suicide bombing"". Or was it a remote detonation? They search the alleys. A burst of gunfire is a warning. The soldier is rescued, but wounded. A man with bombs strapped to his body walks towards the American lines. Is it a trap? Can the harness be removed in time? ""I hate this place."" The year is over. Back home he visits a supermarket. Is this what he was fighting for? ""The older you get the fewer things you really love."" [Is that true?] Will he return for another tour of duty?This film is a pseudo-documentary with little drama in it. Does it have a lesson?

1252476,AVAHA06K08ZKK,B00275EGWY,Alwyn Lau,"[2, 4]","""The battle rush is a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug."" This sums up the conundrum of the Hurt Locker, a film displaying the 'days in the life of' a bomb-defusion team of soldiers in Iraq whose job it is to analyse and resolve bomb scenarios - on a daily basis - in the dusty and tense neighbourhoods of Baghdad.The movie, compellingly shot with almost a 'reality-show' feel, is (as almost every reviewer commented) one of the more authentic war movies appearing for some time. No sensationally cool explosions and barely a soundtrack, no bullets thrashing everything but the good guys, no just-in-time rescues or escapes (e.g. Tears of the Sun), no distracting side-mission (e.g. Three Kings), no unreal defeat of an army by one man (e.g. Rambo) and so on.What's  even more interesting, though, are the hidden (or not so hidden) dimensions of meaning within (or hovering on the margins of) the movie.On one hand, it's a tale of courage and sacrifice for a war-torn community at war with itself. Sgt. Will James and his team count down their days in Baghdad going from street to building to bomb-site either trying to stop bombs from exploding or exploding bombs before they hurt people. In some scenes, the team struggles with the tension of keeping safe as opposed to (usually Sgt. James himsef) going the extra mile to resolve the situation or catch the bad guys. Will may personify, on this view, the American martyr-in-motion risking death from fiery shrapnel so a battle-ravaged people can have fewer bombs on their streets. It's the American soldier as model of Good-against-Evil humanity to balance off America the War-Crazy Nation. The  movie in this sense operates as a poster for the Global Patriot with a conscience.On another hand, The Hurt Locker could be 'standard' Hollywood-fare displaying the mundane horror, hatred, victims and meaninglessness of war so the average media-drenched consumer at home 'connects' better with the war veteran, wounded and dead. The movie's thus a vehicle for social integration, war 'awareness', giving human faces to the War on Terror. The many jagged scenes of civilian confusion, the 'normality' of those planning the bombings, the internal resignation and hopeless faced by the soldiers themselves all make the movie seem like an updated desert-context version of Platoon.Then again, maybe this story ISN'T about war at all. Maybe it's not about how to 'make it' through weeks of almost certain death. Maybe instead the Hurt Locker is about 'surviving' the depression and superficiality of everyday 'peaceful' existence i.e. of Life as we know it.There must be a reason why the central character, Sgt. William James, is named after a philosopher cum psychologist who wrote about pragmatism and how we need to CREATE reality as the part-and-parcel endeavor of understanding it. Truth-value makes sense only the context of use-value i.e. if it doesn't help or doesn't work, it's pointless to discuss it (let alone enshrine it into some philosophical canon).Sgt. James, therefore, could be the embodiment of the drive to 'fix it', to go near problems no one dares to. Will's will to spending his life defusing bombs is a decision which releases him from the need to ponder life's absurdities - like a divorced ex-wife who still stays at home, like the myraid of cereal choices the supermarket offers, like the death of children, like war, like the very need to ponder at all.What would cause a man, after going home and seeing his family (and even playing with his baby son) to choose to RETURN to a whole year defusing devices which could level entire streets and leave hundreds dead? What is so addictive about being face to face with death each and every day?Could it be that bomb defusion becomes the substitute for defusing life? Selecting the right coloured wire to cut may be the ultimate pragmatic act because life becomes (very practically!) focused onto one - and only one - activity which, if done incorrectly, brings everything to a smoky end.The Hurt Locker, perhaps, doesn't represent the space into which men and women are trapped by the pain of war. The *locker* could, instead, mirror the *numbing unbearable hurt of the void of everyday living* from which - other than, say, being incinerated in the heat of detonated C4 - there is no escape.Yes, maybe that's it. The Locker is Life itself.",3,The Locker isn't War - it's Life itself,1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,4371,"['battle', 'rush', 'potent', 'lethal', 'addiction', 'war', 'drug', 'up', 'conundrum', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'film', 'displaying', ""'days"", 'life', 'bomb-defusion', 'team', 'soldiers', 'Iraq', 'job', 'analyse', 'resolve', 'bomb', 'scenarios', 'daily', 'basis', 'dusty', 'tense', 'neighbourhoods', 'Baghdad.The', 'movie', 'compellingly', 'shot', 'almost', ""'reality-show"", 'feel', 'almost', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'one', 'more', 'authentic', 'war', 'movies', 'appearing', 'time', 'sensationally', 'cool', 'explosions', 'barely', 'soundtrack', 'bullets', 'thrashing', 'everything', 'good', 'guys', 'just-in-time', 'rescues', 'escapes', 'e.g', 'Tears', 'Sun', 'distracting', 'side-mission', 'e.g', 'Three', 'Kings', 'unreal', 'defeat', 'army', 'one', 'man', 'e.g', 'Rambo', 'so', 'on.What', 'even', 'more', 'interesting', 'are', 'hidden', 'not', 'so', 'hidden', 'dimensions', 'meaning', 'hovering', 'margins', 'movie.On', 'one', 'hand', 'tale', 'courage', 'sacrifice', 'war-torn', 'community', 'war', 'Sgt', 'Will', 'James', 'team', 'count', 'down', 'days', 'Baghdad', 'going', 'street', 'building', 'bomb-site', 'trying', 'stop', 'bombs', 'exploding', 'exploding', 'bombs', 'hurt', 'people', 'scenes', 'team', 'tension', 'keeping', 'safe', 'opposed', 'usually', 'Sgt', 'James', 'himsef', 'going', 'extra', 'mile', 'resolve', 'situation', 'catch', 'bad', 'guys', 'Will', 'may', 'personify', 'view', 'American', 'martyr-in-motion', 'risking', 'death', 'fiery', 'shrapnel', 'battle-ravaged', 'people', 'can', 'have', 'fewer', 'bombs', 'streets', 'American', 'soldier', 'model', 'Good-against-Evil', 'humanity', 'balance', 'off', 'America', 'War-Crazy', 'Nation', 'movie', 'sense', 'poster', 'Global', 'Patriot', 'conscience.On', 'hand', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'could', 'be', ""'standard"", 'Hollywood-fare', 'displaying', 'mundane', 'horror', 'hatred', 'victims', 'meaninglessness', 'war', 'average', 'media-drenched', 'consumer', 'home', ""'connects"", 'better', 'war', 'veteran', 'wounded', 'dead', 'movie', 'thus', 'vehicle', 'social', 'integration', 'war', ""'awareness"", 'giving', 'human', 'War', 'Terror', 'many', 'jagged', 'scenes', 'civilian', 'confusion', ""'normality"", 'planning', 'bombings', 'internal', 'resignation', 'hopeless', 'faced', 'soldiers', 'make', 'movie', 'seem', 'updated', 'desert-context', 'version', 'Platoon.Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'story', ""N'T"", 'war', 'Maybe', 'not', 'how', ""'make"", 'weeks', 'almost', 'certain', 'death', 'Maybe', 'instead', 'Hurt', 'Locker', ""'surviving"", 'depression', 'superficiality', 'everyday', ""'peaceful"", 'existence', 'i.e', 'Life', 'know', 'it.There', 'must', 'be', 'reason', 'why', 'central', 'character', 'Sgt', 'William', 'James', 'named', 'philosopher', 'cum', 'psychologist', 'who', 'wrote', 'pragmatism', 'how', 'need', 'CREATE', 'reality', 'part-and-parcel', 'endeavor', 'understanding', 'Truth-value', 'sense', 'only', 'context', 'use-value', 'i.e', ""n't"", 'help', ""n't"", 'work', 'pointless', 'discuss', 'let', 'alone', 'enshrine', 'philosophical', 'canon', '.Sgt', 'James', 'therefore', 'could', 'be', 'embodiment', 'drive', ""'fix"", 'go', 'problems', 'one', 'Will', 'will', 'spending', 'life', 'defusing', 'bombs', 'decision', 'need', 'ponder', 'life', 'absurdities', 'divorced', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'still', 'home', 'myraid', 'cereal', 'choices', 'supermarket', 'offers', 'death', 'children', 'war', 'very', 'need', 'ponder', 'would', 'cause', 'man', 'going', 'home', 'seeing', 'family', 'even', 'playing', 'baby', 'son', 'choose', 'RETURN', 'whole', 'year', 'defusing', 'devices', 'could', 'level', 'entire', 'streets', 'leave', 'hundreds', 'dead', 'What', 'so', 'addictive', 'being', 'face', 'face', 'death', 'day', 'Could', 'be', 'bomb', 'defusion', 'substitute', 'defusing', 'life', 'Selecting', 'right', 'coloured', 'wire', 'cut', 'may', 'be', 'ultimate', 'pragmatic', 'act', 'life', 'becomes', 'very', 'practically', 'focused', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'activity', 'done', 'incorrectly', 'everything', 'smoky', 'end.The', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'represent', 'space', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'trapped', 'pain', 'war', '*locker*', 'could', 'instead', 'mirror', '*numbing', 'unbearable', 'hurt', 'void', 'everyday', 'living*', 'other', 'say', 'being', 'incinerated', 'heat', 'detonated', 'C4', 'escape.Yes', 'maybe', 'Locker', 'Life']",N/A

1252480,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B00275EGWY,amerdale876,"[0, 1]","Quite frankly, one of the best war movies I've ever seen. ""The Hurt Locker"" focuses on what it is to actually be addicted to war and the repercussions on those who not only crave it (through the character portrayed by Jeremy Renner), but those who are scared of it (Geraghty) and those who don't understand it (Mackie). Renner, who I've always thought to be a great actor starting with 2002'sDahmerand 2003'sS.W.A.T. (Widescreen Special Edition), takes the lead in this drama as a rebel bomb squad technician who lives on the edge with every bomb he diffuses. An equally impressive Anthony Mackie (We Are Marshall (Widescreen Edition)) plays the spotter on his team, with Geraghty playing the assistant specialist.Most might brush this film off as just another war movie made by the liberal media. However, I believe it's anything but just that. What makes this one of the best war films I've seen is that it doesn't so much as focus on just the action as it does on the humanity itself as well as the psychological toll that comes with fighting a war in a country where anyone can -- and most likely will -- kill you. Add the constant unease of being in a job that is as dangerous as bomb diffusion (where every move might be your last) and it's no surprise to see the mental toll it takes on the three central characters. Each moment these guys go into the field, director Kathryn Bigelow easily conveys (with the help of Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders' on-edge score) the tense moments that fill any soldier's life during war.Bigelow deserved the Directors Guild Of America award for Best Director and the Oscar. The way this film was shot mostly had the feel of a documentary more than a major Hollywood motion picture. And that (along with using mostly slightly unknown actors) helped the believability of the story. I especially liked that the well-known actors used in the film were more like cameos and were not followed throughout the story (Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Evangeline Lilly).For those who don't mind seeing films about war, this should be a must. For those who don't even like war films, you should still give it a try as I find it an essential viewing -- not just in cinema, but also for any film that truly encapsulates a post-9/11 world.",5,Four-and-a-half stars for one of the best contemporary war dramas,1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,2275,"['Quite', 'frankly', 'one', 'best', 'war', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'what', 'actually', 'be', 'addicted', 'war', 'repercussions', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'crave', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'who', 'are', 'scared', 'Geraghty', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Mackie', 'Renner', 'who', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'be', 'great', 'actor', 'starting', ""2002'sDahmerand"", ""2003'sS.W.A.T"", 'Widescreen', 'Special', 'Edition', 'lead', 'drama', 'rebel', 'bomb', 'squad', 'technician', 'who', 'edge', 'bomb', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Are', 'Marshall', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'spotter', 'team', 'Geraghty', 'playing', 'assistant', 'specialist.Most', 'might', 'brush', 'film', 'off', 'as', 'just', 'war', 'movie', 'made', 'liberal', 'media', 'However', 'believe', 'anything', 'just', 'What', 'one', 'best', 'war', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'focus', 'just', 'action', 'humanity', 'as', 'well', 'psychological', 'toll', 'fighting', 'war', 'country', 'where', 'anyone', 'can', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'kill', 'Add', 'constant', 'unease', 'being', 'job', 'as', 'dangerous', 'bomb', 'diffusion', 'where', 'move', 'might', 'be', 'last', 'surprise', 'see', 'mental', 'toll', 'three', 'central', 'characters', 'moment', 'guys', 'go', 'field', 'director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'easily', 'conveys', 'help', 'Marco', 'Beltrami', 'Buck', 'Sanders', 'on-edge', 'score', 'tense', 'moments', 'fill', 'soldier', 'life', 'war.Bigelow', 'deserved', 'Directors', 'Guild', 'America', 'award', 'Best', 'Director', 'Oscar', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'mostly', 'had', 'feel', 'documentary', 'more', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'motion', 'picture', 'using', 'mostly', 'slightly', 'unknown', 'actors', 'helped', 'believability', 'story', 'especially', 'liked', 'well-known', 'actors', 'used', 'film', 'were', 'more', 'cameos', 'were', 'not', 'followed', 'story', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'David', 'Morse', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', '.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'films', 'war', 'should', 'be', 'must', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'like', 'war', 'films', 'should', 'still', 'give', 'try', 'find', 'essential', 'viewing', 'not', 'just', 'cinema', 'also', 'film', 'truly', 'post-9/11', 'world']",N/A
1252481,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B00275EGWY,Amit Talpade,"[1, 5]","The Hurt LockerEach year there is a movie that becomes the favorite of the critics and Hurt Lockers is this year's critical darling.The movie is about the Explosive Ordinance Disposal squad and their routine in Iraq as they go about dismantling IEDS and defusing bombs from potential suicide bombers. This movie follows the three main characters around Iraq and the difficulties of performing well in an environment when one does not know who are the enemy and a friend; the movie was actually shot in Jordan and their daily life. Some are dying to get out of here but the main character Sgt James is absolutely devoted to his job. Note the scene towards the end when he is absolutely clueless in his civilian life while he struggles in the cereal aisle or his conversation with his son and his wife. The movie tries to offer us more glimpses in the life of the two other soldiers but only offers glimpses. Although their job is to keep others same, Sgt James in his zeal and bravado sometimes jeopardizes the life of his companions. Hurt Locker refers to the box kept by Sgt. James which has all the trigger mechanisms of the bombs he has defused.At times or rather the entire movie has the feel of a documentary but without a doubt the action scenes especially the fire fight and the several bomb defusing scenes have been shot extremely well. Congrats to the camera man and his assistants. The tension is nail biting and translated well to the screen. It shows us the service the men of the Army are doing for us and a standing ovation to these brave men. The movie deserves a look because it is probably one of the first movies that I have seen that does not politicize the movie; the other one was Taking Chance (read my review) There is a lot to recommend about the movie but characters have been half baked and the story line thin. A lot of big name stars are in this film Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pierce and Evangaline Lilly but blink and you miss them.This year it is a classic battle of the exes i.e. James Cameroon and Kathyrn Bigelow, I place my bets on Avataar.

1252484,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B00275EGWY,Andrew Desmond,"[1, 2]","I was thoroughly enthralled by ""The Hurt Locker"".  It's a war film without the absurd bravado and fake special effects.  Heroes like Sylvester Stallone and, in an earlier time, Ronald Reagan, are also completely absent.  If it's possible, it's an art house war film.The essence of the story revolves around the lives of a three man Explosive Ordinance Disposal team in Iraq.  Each of the men is very different. The team's leader, Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner) is a war junkie.  He seems to love the adrenaline of the moment.  Unfortunately, this leaves him prone to rash and foolhardy decisions.  His two juniors, Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge, are not happy with his approach; they are just counting down the days to when they can leave Iraq.  As the days count down, the team has many close shaves.  It is these close shaves that keep the viewer on edge.  Defusing ordinance requires great courage and a cool nerve.  The viewer feels the emotion by the bucket load.The essence of James' character is seen briefly near the conclusion of the film.  He has trouble adapting to civilian life.  He wants more of the adrenaline.  It is his lust for excitement that drives the movie.  It is a white knuckle ride at times.""The Hurt Locker"" deserves an Oscar.  It is a modern war classic.

1252485,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00275EGWY,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","It's hard when you wind up sweeping all film awards in a particular year.  It is almost guarantied that you are going to experience major backlash.  It seems that that has happened for the surprise juggernaut that was `The Hurt Locker' (seriously, who the heck saw that coming).  The film is not experiencing the same criticisms that so many other `Best Picture' winners have received in the past (just look at the films average rating on this very site).No, `The Hurt Locker' is not perfect.  In fact, I don't think it should have won the Oscar, even considering the Academy's underwhelming lineup (the film, while VERY good, is not better than Tarantino's masterpiece).  That said; this film is deserving of the praise and certainly undeserving of the backlash.The film centers around a bomb diffuser named William James.  James is a wild one.  He needs to feel the adrenaline rush of near death that so many in his company want to avoid.  He is not afraid of danger.  William gets moved into a new squad when their former leader is killed in the line of duty.  William is unlike anything this squad has seen before, and he almost instantly gets under their skin (but not in a good way).  They have just barely over a month together, but in that month the three main characters (Will, Sanborn and Specialist) undergo many emotional changes.Like most have already noted, this is not a war movie.  It reminds me in a way of Sam Mendes' underappreciated `Jarhead' in that it's main focus is on the men serving and not the service they perform.So, I have a few squabbles with the film.  For me, war movies run a very sharp risk of becoming one note and redundant.  `The Hurt Locker' falls into that department at times.  It becomes almost repetitive in the situations these men find themselves.  Yes, there are differences, but they can run themselves together.  It isn't as present a problem as in some other films, but it is there (for me at least).  I also had some issues with the films handling of the `Beckham' (when you see the film you'll know what I mean).  When Will goes out of his way to find the men `responsible' for what he fears has happened it adds depth to his character but it kind of takes you out of the film a bit.  It just appears far too unrealistic for me.  The final scenes also have that feeling (would three soldiers really do that?) but they fare better because of the emotional turmoil and ending revelations they stir up (that clothed shower scene is FLAWLESS).The films actual ending also felt a little `obvious', which I didn't care for.I know it seems like I'm picking on this film a lot, but really, when taken in perspective these issues are small.  The film is gritty and earnest.  Sure, it has moments where the honesty seems stretched a tad thin, but the character never feel anything short of sincere and real.  The film is visually stunning and completely tuned into the adrenaline rush running through Will's body.  The relationship that builds between the three main characters is engaging and it breathes reality.  While I found some moments to feel a tad `preachy' (I wasn't fond of the repartee between Specialist and his counselor) I also appreciated that the film took an obvious step `away' from being a `message' film.  It just let you dwell in that world and decide for yourself what your really think.Let's talk about Jeremy Renner.  What a brilliant performance.  Yes, he made it seem really easy (so it wasn't `wow look at me act' kind of brilliant) but that's what made it so brilliant.  It was honest.  Every smirk or hand gesture or sideways glance was completely lived in and real.  You never once doubted him and his commitment and his needs and his motives.  He wore everything on his sleeve, but not in the `obvious' way in which some actors approach a character.  He felt like you and me and everyone you know.  Anthony Mackie delivers his best performance to date.  I have an issue with him as an actor because he seems to play a variation of the same character in every film (or he at least brings the same facial expressions to every performance) but he actually develops Sanborn in a way that feels sincere.Oh yeah, and the slew of cameos from greats like Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes were highly appreciated.In the end this film is well worth your time.  It really works on many levels.  Sure, it isn't perfect (and `near-perfect' is even a stretch really) but it is forgivably flawed thanks to many elements (not the least of which was Kathryn Bigelow's fantastic direction...so much developed tension) that work just right.",4,This one's a wild one...,1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,4603,"['hard', 'when', 'wind', 'up', 'sweeping', 'film', 'awards', 'particular', 'year', 'almost', 'guarantied', 'are', 'going', 'experience', 'major', 'backlash', 'happened', 'surprise', 'juggernaut', 'was', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'seriously', 'who', 'heck', 'saw', 'coming', 'film', 'not', 'experiencing', 'same', 'criticisms', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Best', 'Picture', 'winners', 'have', 'received', 'past', 'just', 'look', 'films', 'average', 'rating', 'very', 'site', '.No', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'not', 'perfect', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'even', 'considering', 'Academy', 'underwhelming', 'lineup', 'film', 'VERY', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'Tarantino', 'masterpiece', 'said', 'film', 'deserving', 'praise', 'certainly', 'undeserving', 'backlash.The', 'film', 'centers', 'bomb', 'diffuser', 'named', 'William', 'James', 'James', 'wild', 'one', 'feel', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'near', 'death', 'so', 'many', 'company', 'want', 'avoid', 'not', 'afraid', 'danger', 'William', 'moved', 'new', 'squad', 'when', 'former', 'leader', 'killed', 'line', 'duty', 'William', 'anything', 'squad', 'seen', 'almost', 'instantly', 'skin', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'have', 'just', 'barely', 'month', 'together', 'month', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Will', 'Sanborn', 'Specialist', 'undergo', 'many', 'emotional', 'changes.Like', 'most', 'have', 'already', 'noted', 'not', 'war', 'movie', 'way', 'Sam', 'Mendes', 'underappreciated', 'Jarhead', 'main', 'focus', 'men', 'serving', 'not', 'service', 'perform.So', 'have', 'few', 'squabbles', 'film', 'war', 'movies', 'run', 'very', 'sharp', 'risk', 'becoming', 'one', 'note', 'redundant', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'falls', 'department', 'times', 'almost', 'repetitive', 'situations', 'men', 'find', 'Yes', 'are', 'differences', 'can', 'run', 'together', ""n't"", 'as', 'present', 'problem', 'other', 'films', 'there', 'least', 'also', 'had', 'issues', 'films', 'handling', 'Beckham', 'when', 'see', 'film', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'When', 'Will', 'way', 'find', 'men', 'responsible', 'what', 'happened', 'depth', 'character', 'kind', 'film', 'bit', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'final', 'scenes', 'also', 'have', 'feeling', 'would', 'three', 'soldiers', 'really', 'do', 'fare', 'better', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'ending', 'revelations', 'stir', 'up', 'clothed', 'shower', 'scene', 'FLAWLESS', '.The', 'films', 'actual', 'ending', 'also', 'felt', 'little', 'obvious', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'for.I', 'know', ""'m"", 'picking', 'film', 'lot', 'really', 'when', 'taken', 'perspective', 'issues', 'are', 'small', 'film', 'gritty', 'earnest', 'Sure', 'moments', 'where', 'honesty', 'stretched', 'tad', 'thin', 'character', 'never', 'feel', 'anything', 'short', 'sincere', 'real', 'film', 'visually', 'stunning', 'completely', 'tuned', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'running', 'Will', 'body', 'relationship', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'engaging', 'reality', 'found', 'moments', 'feel', 'tad', 'preachy', 'was', ""n't"", 'fond', 'repartee', 'Specialist', 'counselor', 'also', 'appreciated', 'film', 'took', 'obvious', 'step', 'away', 'being', 'message', 'film', 'just', 'let', 'dwell', 'world', 'decide', 'what', 'really', 'think.Let', 'talk', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'What', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Yes', 'made', 'seem', 'really', 'easy', 'was', ""n't"", 'wow', 'look', 'act', 'kind', 'brilliant', 'what', 'made', 'so', 'brilliant', 'was', 'honest', 'Every', 'smirk', 'hand', 'gesture', 'sideways', 'glance', 'was', 'completely', 'lived', 'real', 'never', 'once', 'doubted', 'commitment', 'needs', 'motives', 'wore', 'everything', 'sleeve', 'not', 'obvious', 'way', 'actors', 'approach', 'character', 'felt', 'everyone', 'know', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'have', 'issue', 'actor', 'play', 'variation', 'same', 'character', 'film', 'least', 'brings', 'same', 'facial', 'expressions', 'performance', 'actually', 'Sanborn', 'way', 'sincere.Oh', 'yeah', 'slew', 'cameos', 'greats', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'David', 'Morse', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'were', 'highly', 'end', 'film', 'well', 'time', 'really', 'many', 'levels', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'near-perfect', 'even', 'stretch', 'really', 'forgivably', 'flawed', 'thanks', 'many', 'elements', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'fantastic', 'direction', 'so', 'much', 'developed', 'tension', 'work', 'just', 'right']",N/A

I cannot attest to the film's portrayal of the military overseas, since I'm not an enlisted man, so all I can do is judge this film on the impression it made on me. And based on that, I hope this movie does walk away with that award.The film doesn't have a set story, because war is never all that predictable. It follows a group of three soldiers in the U.S. Army's Explosive Ordinance Disposal team (EOD) as they move from mission to terrifying mission through war-torn Iraq. It's odd how there's very little I can say about the plot, because it really is all about the trade of defusing IED's throughout the country. But the events are shown with such intensity, and such attention to detail, that I really couldn't tell if the next bomb would be the one to kill the main characters, or if they would hopefully make it out safe.Jeremy Renner gives an outstanding performance as Staff Sergeant William James, who begins to embody the quote that is provided at the start of the movie: war is a drug. He has a mad obsession to thwart his faceless enemy's creations that borders on heated competition and hatred, and he quickly begins to lose himself in it all. He gives the impression of a man who accepted his fate in such a dangerous profession a long time ago, and acts with the abandon that such emotional freedom provides. If he doesn't at the very least get nominated for best actor of the year, I will be disappointed.The set pieces are set up and shot so brilliantly. The quick cuts and an almost paranoid sense of direction add to the feeling of anxiety that each defusal mission. I was tense and almost frightened by what could happen on each outing, and I didn't relax until the three main characters were safely back at Camp Victory. A movie that can do that has instantly earned my admiration.THE HURT LOCKER is not so much meant to be watched, but rather, to be experienced. I loved this film's ability to conjure tense situations and link them together with more-than-likable characters. And I respect the filmmakers' decision to leave politics at the door, and create a movie that has nary a hint of bias in regards to a stance on the war overseas.",5,Exhilarating to the last frame,1264291200,"01 24, 2010",2010,2400,"['not', 'THE', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', 'one', 'front-runners', 'best', 'picture', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'year', 'more', 'likely', 'going', 'win', 'AVATAR', 'impress', 'rather', 'sporadic', 'likes', 'Academy', 'officials', 'can', 'not', 'attest', 'film', 'portrayal', 'military', 'overseas', ""'m"", 'not', 'enlisted', 'man', 'can', 'do', 'judge', 'film', 'impression', 'made', 'based', 'hope', 'movie', 'walk', 'away', 'award.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'set', 'story', 'war', 'never', 'predictable', 'group', 'three', 'soldiers', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Explosive', 'Ordinance', 'Disposal', 'team', 'EOD', 'move', 'mission', 'terrifying', 'mission', 'war-torn', 'Iraq', 'odd', 'how', 'very', 'little', 'can', 'say', 'plot', 'really', 'trade', 'defusing', 'IED', 'country', 'events', 'are', 'shown', 'such', 'intensity', 'such', 'attention', 'detail', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'next', 'bomb', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'kill', 'main', 'characters', 'would', 'hopefully', 'make', 'out', 'safe.Jeremy', 'Renner', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'William', 'James', 'who', 'embody', 'quote', 'provided', 'start', 'movie', 'war', 'drug', 'mad', 'obsession', 'thwart', 'faceless', 'enemy', 'creations', 'borders', 'heated', 'competition', 'hatred', 'quickly', 'lose', 'impression', 'man', 'who', 'accepted', 'fate', 'such', 'dangerous', 'profession', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'abandon', 'such', 'emotional', 'freedom', ""n't"", 'very', 'least', 'get', 'nominated', 'best', 'actor', 'year', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed.The', 'set', 'pieces', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'shot', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'quick', 'cuts', 'almost', 'paranoid', 'sense', 'direction', 'add', 'feeling', 'anxiety', 'defusal', 'mission', 'was', 'tense', 'almost', 'frightened', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'outing', 'did', ""n't"", 'relax', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'safely', 'back', 'Camp', 'Victory', 'A', 'movie', 'can', 'do', 'instantly', 'earned', 'admiration.THE', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'meant', 'be', 'watched', 'rather', 'be', 'experienced', 'loved', 'film', 'ability', 'conjure', 'tense', 'situations', 'link', 'together', 'more-than-likable', 'characters', 'respect', 'filmmakers', 'decision', 'leave', 'politics', 'door', 'create', 'movie', 'nary', 'hint', 'bias', 'regards', 'stance', 'war', 'overseas']",N/A

1252490,ARA48345JZPZR,B00275EGWY,Archmaker,"[3, 5]","Kathryn Bigelow has fashioned an amazingly gripping and tense film as she takes us inside a bomb disposal team working the mean streets of Baghdad.  It is a wonder how fine film making can still cause a skeptical viewer to suspend disbelief and catch a tangible emotional and physical sense of the unbearable tension and palm-sweating fear of being centerstage amid barely supressed hostility from a local population made up of the friendly, the indifferent and the murderous.  In short, she has created a chair-gripping intensity and her close-in camera work puts us right in the middle of the tension.Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, who imbedded with an actual Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit, waste no time getting us into the midst of the tension and action that is an everyday commonplace for these exceptional individuals.  Two surviving members of a team that has lost its leader get a hairy and wary introduction to the style and methods of their new team leader, Sgt. James (Jeremy Renner).  A gifted bomb disposer with a seemingly fearless daring, his teammates Sgt. Sanborn and Spc.Eldridge are more concerned that he is a ""cowboy"" that may increase the danger to themselves, which is already considerable.  They are operating in pure survival mode, while their new boss seems to be in a different, potentially dangerous, mental and emotional zone.Jeremy Renner's Sgt. James is not an easy read either.  Is his daring approach really recklessness or does he have a more realistic assessment of the danger and the odds?  Is he simply an adrenaline junky that gets off on the fear and pressure, or is he an accomplished professional that has found his calling and his talent and simply realizes that death is always present, and that error is fatal no matter what precautions are taken?  As has been noted by nearly every reviewer, Renner's portrait of this man is subtle and nuanced and brilliantly achieved.  He is nicely complimented by the work of Anthony Mackie (Sanborn) and Brian Geraghty (Eldridge).Likewise, these three young leads are ably supported by Bigelow and Boal, who have created an unsentimental script that wastes no time in preaching or in sidetrips or extraneous scenes that do nothing to illuminate these men and the situation they find themselves in.  With a, thank God, absence of pontificating, moral pronouncements, and political bias, they let the sweaty terror of where these men have to work and what they have to do speak volumes about the ambiguity of this war and any other.  This is nasty business, and the tangible hostility of death arriving from any balcony, around any corner, or in any trap is always readily present and felt.This is brilliant film making, up close and personal in its execution and allowing a terrific showcase for the young talented actors involved.  Yes, there are cameos by David Morse, Guy Pearce, Ralph Feinnes and Evangeline Lily, but they are just that, cameos.  The bulk of this film rests on the shoulders of Renner, Mackie and Geraghty and they are superb.  I've been a longtime fan of Kathryn Bigelow from her Near Dark debut, through her hits and misses, although even the latter have often demonstrated her energy and chops as an action director.  Here she has married that talent to a fine script written by someone who knows what he's writing about, and the result is a fine film with a subtle subtext and arguably one of the best pictures to emerge from the Iraq war.  It should be seen.",5,"Out on the Adrenaline Edge with the ""Wild Man"".....",1250985600,"08 23, 2009",2009,3474,"['Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'fashioned', 'amazingly', 'gripping', 'tense', 'film', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'team', 'working', 'mean', 'streets', 'Baghdad', 'wonder', 'how', 'fine', 'film', 'making', 'can', 'still', 'cause', 'skeptical', 'viewer', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'catch', 'tangible', 'emotional', 'physical', 'sense', 'unbearable', 'tension', 'palm-sweating', 'fear', 'being', 'centerstage', 'barely', 'supressed', 'hostility', 'local', 'population', 'made', 'friendly', 'indifferent', 'murderous', 'short', 'created', 'chair-gripping', 'intensity', 'close-in', 'camera', 'work', 'right', 'middle', 'tension.Bigelow', 'screenwriter', 'Mark', 'Boal', 'who', 'imbedded', 'actual', 'Explosive', 'Ordnance', 'Disposal', 'unit', 'waste', 'time', 'getting', 'midst', 'tension', 'action', 'everyday', 'commonplace', 'exceptional', 'individuals', 'Two', 'surviving', 'members', 'team', 'lost', 'leader', 'get', 'hairy', 'wary', 'introduction', 'style', 'methods', 'new', 'team', 'leader', 'Sgt', 'James', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'gifted', 'bomb', 'disposer', 'seemingly', 'fearless', 'daring', 'teammates', 'Sgt', 'Sanborn', 'Spc.Eldridge', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'cowboy', 'may', 'increase', 'danger', 'already', 'considerable', 'are', 'operating', 'pure', 'survival', 'mode', 'new', 'boss', 'be', 'different', 'potentially', 'dangerous', 'mental', 'emotional', 'zone.Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Sgt', 'James', 'not', 'easy', 'read', 'daring', 'approach', 'really', 'recklessness', 'have', 'more', 'realistic', 'assessment', 'danger', 'odds', 'simply', 'adrenaline', 'junky', 'off', 'fear', 'pressure', 'accomplished', 'professional', 'found', 'calling', 'talent', 'simply', 'realizes', 'death', 'always', 'present', 'error', 'fatal', 'matter', 'what', 'precautions', 'are', 'taken', 'been', 'noted', 'nearly', 'reviewer', 'Renner', 'portrait', 'man', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'brilliantly', 'achieved', 'nicely', 'complimented', 'work', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Sanborn', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'Eldridge', '.Likewise', 'three', 'young', 'leads', 'are', 'ably', 'supported', 'Bigelow', 'Boal', 'who', 'have', 'created', 'unsentimental', 'script', 'time', 'preaching', 'sidetrips', 'extraneous', 'scenes', 'do', 'nothing', 'illuminate', 'men', 'situation', 'find', 'thank', 'God', 'absence', 'pontificating', 'moral', 'pronouncements', 'political', 'bias', 'let', 'sweaty', 'terror', 'where', 'men', 'have', 'work', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'speak', 'volumes', 'ambiguity', 'war', 'other', 'nasty', 'business', 'tangible', 'hostility', 'death', 'arriving', 'balcony', 'corner', 'trap', 'always', 'readily', 'present', 'felt.This', 'brilliant', 'film', 'making', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'execution', 'allowing', 'terrific', 'showcase', 'young', 'talented', 'actors', 'involved', 'Yes', 'are', 'cameos', 'David', 'Morse', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Ralph', 'Feinnes', 'Evangeline', 'Lily', 'are', 'just', 'cameos', 'bulk', 'film', 'shoulders', 'Renner', 'Mackie', 'Geraghty', 'are', 'superb', ""'ve"", 'been', 'longtime', 'fan', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'Near', 'Dark', 'debut', 'hits', 'misses', 'even', 'latter', 'have', 'often', 'demonstrated', 'energy', 'chops', 'action', 'director', 'Here', 'married', 'talent', 'fine', 'script', 'written', 'someone', 'who', 'what', 'writing', 'about', 'result', 'fine', 'film', 'subtle', 'subtext', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'pictures', 'emerge', 'Iraq', 'war', 'should', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

The main problem is how completely unbelievable the actions of the main character were. He just keeps initiating dangerous, unauthorized actions that place himself, his unit and the war effort itself in needless jeopardy, usually with no explanation or apparent reason.  The audience is left to guess that he's working out his own deeply-rooted psychological issues, but it seems highly unlikely that the military would allow anyone to keep going rogue like that: contrary to the filmmaker's mythic vision, there are rules of engagement and a chain of command in the military -- that's the way things work.  Sure, a lot of errors and bad judgment calls were made in the Iraq war, but I doubt they looked anything like this, and besides, the filmmaker seems to be saying that all this guy's crazy rule-breaking was a *good* thing, just the sort of wild, intuitive cowboy-upping that we'd need to win the war. Sounds like BS to me -- the military wins by disciplined, methodical action, having a clear game plan so that when things do get chaotic, you can still prevail.Speaking of chaos, the film itself seemed rather poorly made, particularly in key action sequences, such as the bomb defusing outside the UN compound: just what the heck is going on in that scene?  Mostly, all I could tell was that a certain level of tension was established, after which the motivations and actions of various participants were rather unclear, and then after several poorly-choreographed minutes, the scene ended and we were told to go on home, nothing left to see here. I thought the script was pretty weak, the execution kind of clumsy and the editorial viewpoint rather unclear. Most, though, it's just not very believable that the US military would put up with the showboating and insubordination of the main character: they would just demote him and have some other guys do the work instead.

First of all it's nice to see a movie set in a desert environment instead of the jungle lands of Vietnam (a war that's been well documented by this point).  That in itself is a nice refreshing change, and I believe we will continue to see more desert-themed war films in the future thanks to both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars of the last several years.No doubt in my mind the reason a (supposed) realistic storyline pertaining to the war in Iraq was created in the first place resulting in the Hurt Locker being released is because of all the Americans and British who sit here day in and day out wondering exactly what's going on over there.  I find out through reading some reviews here on amazon that the film isn't really that realistic though which is unfortunate.What's most appealing about the Hurt Locker is the way it continuously keeps the audience guessing exactly when the explosions and gun bursts from the sneaky Iraqi enemies will occur.  They almost never happen during the times you THINK they will, and that alone is quite surprising.  The one exception is the man who had bombs wrapped around his chest and waist.  Yeah, you just knew he didn't have a lot of time left.As far as the acting goes, well truth be told I've seen better.  It mainly sticks to a few select soldiers who are not necessarily buddies, but they gradually win over each others respect by frequently putting themselves in harms way and setting a mood filled with tension and fear.  They always look out for each other and live dangerously, that's for sure.  Respect is certainly earned as a result.Overall, yeah, perhaps it could have been shortered by about 30-45 minutes, but I honestly wasn't bored at all.

Nothing in the movie is correct, and it plays out more like what a typical FoxNEWS viewer who's never been in Iraq would picture the war to be like. There is a mishmash of PTSD, lots of crying, some fighting, horrific displays of ""tactics,"" and a slight delve into soldiers favorite slur: hajji which is portrayed as a significant emotional event by the one guy who says it. A more accurate title for this movie would be ""Hallmark Presents: IRAQ! The After School Special.""Aside from the ludicrous plot, complete disregard for any sort of military accuracy, and ho-hum backdrops (when Black Hawk Down's recreation of Mogadishu, Somalia looks more like Iraq than the Hurt Locker, there might be a problem), the Hurt Locker greatly suffers from terrible acting. The main character played by Jeremy Renner, is the only actor who really looks like he is trying. His supporting cast plays every cliche in the book from ""Scared-Teenager"" to ""Partner who Wants To Be Tough But Lives In Fear"" to ""Cowboy Colonel"" to ""Crusty Mercinary, or Maybe He's Special Forces, I Don't Know Because He Wasn't Introduced, Oh Wait Now He's Dead."" The movie tries to be everything. It tries to put its Explosive Ordinance Disposal team through EVERYTHING from disarming bombs to executing ludicrous attempts at infantry tactics, to engaging in a sniper battle instead of focusing and developing a strong plot on a narrow band of topics.Eventhough it was easily one of the worst war movies I've ever seen, I will give credit where it is due. The hurt Locker does have a very good ending. If you don't want it spoiled because somehow you still want to watch this filmschool project gone awry, stop reading. If you've decided to take my advice, here is the spoiler: The Hurt Locker's ending is the conclusion of the movie's opening statement that war is a drug. Renner's character returns home and realizes that he misses Iraq, he misses the thrill one can only get from constantly living in constant danger, with people trying to kill you. He picks up his son, and then it cuts to him reporting to a new unit for another tour in Iraq. This was probably the only well done part of the whole movie, and I have yet to see another movie touch on it, which more should.In the end, Hurt Locker gets a big thumbs down.

Probably of all the movies made of the wars in the Gulf, this is one of the most realistic. When you compare this to films likeThree Kings (Snap Case),Rules of EngagementorCourage Under Fireits less Hollywood ""drama"" and more documentary in presentation. The only supplement featurette included says that they chose the director of photography because of his documentary style. Casting is superb too. I can see this movie raking in big at the Academy Awards. But while the movie has an engaging storyline, lots of action, exposes the audience to a new subject, Hollywood has again just churned out a Blu-ray offering sorely lacking in extras. A commentary and short featurette is something you would expect for a grade B movie, not one that people are talking Best Picture Academy Award nominations. I guess the  public needs to stop buying these bare extras offerings(Paranormal Activity (2-Disc Digital Copy Edition) [Blu-ray] was even worse) and either wait for the price to drop below $10 or until an extras packed edition is released to send a message to the studios.

1252505,A30TQET02FLSUX,B00275EGWY,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[0, 0]","I recently revisited The Hurt Locker (2008) in HD. As the Best Picture Oscar winner of 2009, The Hurt Locker is definitely a good movie well worth watching...and an important movie about our current wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It's a film that explores some of the psychological effects that modern warfare has on the soldiers fighting these wars, specifically the soldiers that disarm bombs. Our current wars don't have the same cut-and-dry sides that WWII did, when the good guys and bad guys were more clearly defined. But war is still war at its most basic levels, and every war means that the soldiers have to deal with killing and death.My appreciation of The Hurt Locker has not changed in the last year since I first saw the film on DVD and reviewed it. I give it 3.5 stars out of 5. Having now seen 6 out of the 10 nominated Best Picture films for 2009, along with a bunch of other 2009 films not nominated for Best Picture, I'm not so sure that The Hurt Locker deserved to win Best Picture of 2009. I do think it was deserving over Avatar, which was visually and technologically incredible, but empty in terms of its story and characters. But my pick for best picture of 2009 is the underrated and not nominated A Single Man by director Tom Ford, followed by (500) Days of Summer and Crazy Heart. And out of the group of war films in 2009, I think Brothers was just slightly better than The Hurt Locker, The Messenger, and Inglourious Basterds. But all 4 of these war films are worthy of viewing. It's not my intention to harp on whether or not The Hurt Locker was awards-worthy, but I thought I'd share my opinions here since I've now seen enough films from 2009 to render an opinion.What I will emphasize that is brilliant about The Hurt Locker is the documentary-style cinematography and storytelling. Screenwriter Mark Boal, a journalist who was embedded with troops in Iraq during the war, brings a realism and depth to the story and its characters that feels authentic. Certainly parts of the movie are dramatized and Hollywood-ized as all fiction films are, but for the most part, you feel like you are right there in Iraq with the soldiers. The production design is flawless, with that same sun-bleached dusty desert look that we've become accustomed to in war movies about the middle east from the past 10 years. That look and feel really goes back to the excellent film Three Kings (1999), which was one of the first middle-eastern set ""war"" films, along with Courage Under Fire (1996). And it continued with Ridley Scott's excellent film Black Hawk Down (2001).There is no doubt in my mind that Director Kathryn Bigelow deserved her Best Directing Oscar. She's a very talented woman in what is generally a man's field. And for her to have made the statements she's made with her films over the years, she deserves Academy recognition. And of course we were well overdue for our first female Best Director. I do think Point Break (1991) is her best film, with The Hurt Locker at #2. Her Oscar win, like so many, is really for her body of work. The Hurt Locker was simply the film that pushed her over the edge into winning.As I mentioned in my previous review, the three main actors, led by Jeremy Renner, are very good in this film, even though their characters seem a little empty and distant at times. Of course one could argue that they are that way because that's how these soldiers are and have to be to do their job. They can't get too emotional or involved, but instead stay ""distant"" to protect themselves. I do buy that argument, but this is still a movie, and for me to care about the characters, I need to be able to understand and feel who they are and what they are up to. There are moments in the film that provide that, but they are connected by long spells without it.The pacing and editing of The Hurt Locker are very solid and at times brilliant. Using multiple cameras to shoot various scenes in the film, the filmmakers apparently had a million feet of film to work from to create and edit this movie. So my hats are off to the editors working hard to chip away the best of all the material captured for this story. There are a few scenes where the tension and emotion are so palpable, that you just become fixed to your TV anxiously awaiting resolution.

1252506,A1P7O2PAA8H1DD,B00275EGWY,Blade329,"[3, 4]","I enjoyed this movie, but after reading some quotes from actual soldiers that served in Iraq, I felt a bit cheated.  The movie centers around an Army EOD (bomb disposal)unit serving in Iraq.  You follow this unit in their everyday activities such as finding/disarming IED's and other bombs.  I commend the film makers for choosing to talk about these soldiers and how dangerous their jobs are.  The real soldiers out there doing this job are hero's in my mind. The film does a good job of showing how scary it is in Iraq and how danger can lurk in any window, alley or building.  What the film does badly though is portraying the leader of the EOD unit as a cowboy who breaks the rules and puts his team in unnecessary danger over and over again.  The character Sgt James is just not believable.  That just killed the ""authentic"" feel of the movie.  I'm not a soldier, but even I can figure out that an EOD unit would not just go off on it's own with no support, not telling anyone, and search for insurgents.  No way.  Sgt James going out alone in a hoodie to find some people?  Not. I also read that the characters were not wearing the correct uniforms in the movie.  I'm sure the producers wanted to ""jazz"" up the movie with some ""drama"", but why?  Is the life of one of these soldiers so ""boring"" that it had to be hammed up like that?  I think nonsense like that just takes away from the film.  What they did get right though, they did well.  The actors are terrific.  Sgt James may be a ridiculous character, but Jeremy Renner did a great acting job with him.  It's a good movie, to be sure, but it has some flaws.",4,"Good movie, but some problems",1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,1620,"['enjoyed', 'movie', 'reading', 'quotes', 'actual', 'soldiers', 'served', 'Iraq', 'felt', 'bit', 'cheated', 'movie', 'centers', 'Army', 'EOD', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'unit', 'serving', 'Iraq', 'follow', 'unit', 'everyday', 'activities', 'such', 'finding/disarming', 'IED', 'other', 'bombs', 'commend', 'film', 'makers', 'choosing', 'talk', 'soldiers', 'how', 'dangerous', 'jobs', 'are', 'real', 'soldiers', 'out', 'there', 'doing', 'job', 'are', 'hero', 'mind', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'scary', 'Iraq', 'how', 'danger', 'can', 'lurk', 'window', 'alley', 'building', 'What', 'film', 'badly', 'portraying', 'leader', 'EOD', 'unit', 'cowboy', 'who', 'rules', 'team', 'unnecessary', 'danger', 'over', 'again', 'character', 'Sgt', 'James', 'just', 'not', 'believable', 'just', 'killed', 'authentic', 'feel', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'soldier', 'even', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'EOD', 'unit', 'would', 'not', 'just', 'go', 'off', 'own', 'support', 'not', 'telling', 'anyone', 'search', 'insurgents', 'way', 'Sgt', 'James', 'going', 'out', 'alone', 'hoodie', 'find', 'people', 'Not', 'also', 'read', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'wearing', 'correct', 'uniforms', 'movie', ""'m"", 'sure', 'producers', 'wanted', 'jazz', 'movie', 'drama', 'why', 'life', 'one', 'soldiers', 'so', 'boring', 'had', 'be', 'hammed', 'up', 'think', 'nonsense', 'just', 'away', 'film', 'What', 'did', 'get', 'right', 'did', 'well', 'actors', 'are', 'terrific', 'Sgt', 'James', 'may', 'be', 'ridiculous', 'character', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'did', 'great', 'acting', 'job', 'good', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'flaws']",N/A

1252510,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00275EGWY,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 5]","I was beginning to hold out some hope (however little) that the Oscars might have been steering away from political correctness and social appeasement when, last year,Slumdog Millionairetook home 8 of the 10 categories it was nominated in, including Best Picture. A ""feel-good"" movie made on a $15 million budget with no-name actors, it came out of nowhere and blindsided many viewers and Academy voters. Pleasantly surprised, I flipped on the Oscars this year (2010) and watched the who's who for films in 2009.I'm not going to take any large swings as THE HURT LOCKER because it was a good movie. I enjoyed the action, the tension, the acting. It was all nicely pulled together. But, out of the ten Best Picture nominees this year, was it really the stand-out? I felt that the Academy was slipping, once again, into the realm of trying to be ""significant"" and ""modern"" by voting for something that's on everyone's mind (the war in Iraq). Again, the movie was okay. Good. Adequate. But head-and-shoulders above such films asInglourious Basterds?District 9?Up in the Air? I humbly disagree that it was. And there was nothing in it that we haven't seen before: a war movie with internal angst and a man lost amidst society when he returns home. Jeremy Renner (28 Weeks Later) did a fine job as the risk-taking Sergeant James but, again, he was channeling every other warrior brought into a tough situation that we've seen on celluloid a gazillion times.From reading what you've read of my review so far, you might think that I'm being more critical of the Academy than the film. That's partially correct. But when so much attention is heaped upon one film (including Best Director ...which we'll cover in a moment) and so many people think that this is ""the film to watch"" and not the other nominees that won little or nothing, I believe of informing those who might choose to read this of their folly should they not see something like District 9 or -- one that didn't even get mentioned --Moon.Let's hit on the Best Director item...No female director has ever won an Oscar before Kathryn Bigelow did for The Hurt Locker. So what! We never elected a black President before Obama. Does that mean we should give him every break just because no other black man has ever sat in the White House? No! You win because you deserve to win, not because it's never happened to someone of your kind before. Was the directing of The Hurt Locker better than Inglorious Basterds? Was it? Sorry, but I completely disagree if you think it was.I will say that I'm glad AVATAR didn't win Best Picture or Best Director. But to completely blank out such phenomenal films as DISTRICT 9 and other worthy competitors is simply ridiculous.I think it's important for me to say here that I completely support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan; they risk their lives daily so that I can live the life I do over here in the U.S. They risk they're lives so that I can write something like this about a film they may care deeply about. But caring deeply about a subject like The Hurt Locker and elevating it above other films does a disservice to the art of film-making and film-makers when you over-rate a movie based on it's significance in the world today and not on its art.For me, the top films of 2009 were DISTRICT 9, INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and MOON. Two got a smidgin of notice and one never saw the light of the Oscar ballots. Check those films out before deciding where the awards should've landed for movies made in 2009.

1252515,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B00275EGWY,Brian A. Schar,"[1, 2]","""Hurt Locker"" is a modern version of a movie that's been made dozens of times before for the plethora of conflicts in which the Federal Government has engaged.  The performances are great, and there is a lot of tension when it comes to defusing the bombs.  In a way, this is the old British WWII series ""Danger UXB"" (which is worth seeking out) tarted up with a big budget for the Second Iraq War.However, I didn't find this movie to be anything special.  When you get a title card that tells you how many days Bravo company has left on its tour, you know for a fact exactly what is going to happen to which member of the team, if you've ever seen a movie.  When somebody gets short, and they're in a cop or military movie, there's only one thing that can happen.  Sadly, that same cliche happens here.  The pace of the movie is overly slow.  I know they're trying to establish tension, but after 30 minutes there's no real story or plot and the audience is left wondering what exactly is going on.  We don't really get what the bomb guys are doing to defuse the bombs; they don't talk us through it or give any explanation, so you're also left wondering about the tension and when it's supposed to stop.

1252518,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B00275EGWY,buru buru piggu,"[10, 14]","Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, one of a scant few women directors in Hollywood, ""The Hurt Locker"" is the best film I've seen so far about the Iraq conflict. Categorized as a ""war thriller"", it centers on an elite US Army EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit and the dangers they encounter as they complete the final weeks of their year-long tour of duty. The film starts with a ""cold open"" (no credits or title card), throwing you right into middle of an IED defusal. We see three men engaging in playful banter while guiding a bomb disposal robot before a snag forces Thompson, the bomb tech (Guy Pearce), to attempt a manually defusal. The situation quickly escalates when Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) spots an insurgent holding a cellphone. Ordered by Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) to ""burn him"", Owen is paralyzed by fear and unable to pull the trigger, resulting in a detonation that kills Thompson.Top-flight bomb disposal expert Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) is sent in as a replacement. Right away on their first mission, the team finds out that he is a reckless and impulsive loose cannon whose blatant disregard for operating procedures puts everyone's lives in danger. Over the course of the film, we see personality clashes develop, sometimes becoming violent, as J.T. and Owen accuse Will of endangering their lives for a high. Over time, however, J.T. comes to respect Will and the work he does. We see Will's intense dedication to his job and self-sacrifice in the face of overwhelming bodily peril.Ralph Fiennes makes a brief appearance as the leader of a small group of British PMC's, as does a mustachioed David Morse, who is here for a short couple of minute as a loud and boisterous Colonel, mostly for comic effect.The Hurt locker is a gritty, muscular, and visceral viewing experience. Filmed in a jittery cinema veritee style, we get a sense of immediacy and closeness that few other films employing this technique have been able to match. Where it was nauseating inCloverfieldor devoid of warmth inPublic Enemies, it is tastefully and masterfully done here. I was never distracted or taken out of a scene to remark on the camerawork. The style really works here and enhanced the immersion I felt, heightening the tension level and perception of realism. I felt my heart racing in many of the high-tension scenes not knowing what would happen next, not an easy task given how jaded I've become as a result of Hollywood movie-making. Without a doubt, ""The Hurt Locker"" is one of the most thrilling and suspenseful military dramas I've seen in a long time. I must also remark on the sound design and music. All of it came together and felt very natural, further adding to the production value and enjoyability of this film. Last, I must warn of some extreme gore, particularly one scene towards the end.Highly enjoyable and worth watching, especially if you enjoyed urban conflict films likeBlack Hawk Down. A must-own if you are a war film fan.About the Blu-ray disc itself:The Hurt Locker is a 50GB Region A disc sporting an excellent transfer, but the extras are thin, with only a director's commentary, a 12 minute making-of documentary, and a 23 minute narrated slideshow. Subtitles are English (SDH) and Spanish only, with an additional Spanish audio track.

1252521,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00275EGWY,Caleb Williams,"[1, 3]","""The Hurt Locker"" currently stands as the most critically acclaimed film of 2009 and after seeing it just this week I'm inclined to agree this acclamation wholeheartedly. This really is a work of art from start to finish and has now been moved to the top of my list of movies to own and cherish forever. Since its release it has won numerous awards and has 9 Academy award nominations which they will undoubtedly win come the ceremony in March. The cast comprises of unknowns, but are ones with very familiar faces as, after doing a bit of research, a few of the actors have had very minor roles in other TV shows and movies so if this will be their leap to the big time, then it's well deserved.During the early stages of the Iraq war in 2004, this film follows a 3 member EOD (Explosives Ordinance Disposal) unit as they go about their missions in providing cover for one member, Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) while he disarms IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices. James' behaviour in rushing into the blast radius without sending in the bomb disposal robot first leads to him being labelled reckless by his fellow officers, Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). This image of a reckless officer has a negative effect on the team dynamic and as the film progresses you become more and more aware of the individual reasons why each character is the way he is.This film doesn't really follow a plot in the sense of that the team must solve some form of deep seeded puzzle, or there is a mastermind behind the bombs that this unit specifically dealt with. It simply follows a trio of officers as they do the same job which is being done for real in Iraq and touches upon how those officers deal with the situations in which they find themselves. The director, Kathryn Bigelow, wanted the film to immerse the viewer into something that was ""Raw, immediate and Visceral"". That it certainly achieved perfectly as although some of the scenes may seem slow, they're slow for a purpose. It wants you to be aware that anything can change at any time and although there may be a slight stint of calm and silence, that can change in an instant and it was brilliantly done.Although some of the actors may be better known than others, I'm happy in a way that it isn't a cast of megastars playing these roles. In a movie like this, if you had a cast that consisted of the likes of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon or Tom Cruise, for example, then the film simply wouldn't have the same impact. You would watch it for another purpose, rather than simply watching it for the story and that is why there appears to be this revolution of sorts with more and more of the most critically successful films containing unknown or little known actors rather than the big names. The film was shot in both Jordan and Kuwait and had a really authentic look and feel to it and the film is overall well deserving of any praise which it receives.However, there is one gripe I have about this film and it is one which was touched upon by other reviewers who unfairly gave it 1 star just due to this point alone. The way in which British servicemen were portrayed around the middle of the film was terribly offensive and overly typical to the point I had expected it to happen at some point during the film before even switching it on. There have been mountains of films that have done this and this will not be the last to make such a mistake, on the other side of the argument though, you would almost expect an English film to do the same thing to the Americans regardless of how serious the film is supposed to be. Although I did find this slightly offensive, I didn't let this damage my view of the film as a whole which I still support as being sublime.Shockingly brilliant and although it let me down in one particular scene, the film overall was superb. On Blu-Ray this film is especially done justice as the detail and resolution just makes it visually superb in its own right. Buy it, rent it or watch it at a friend's house. This is definitely a film to see.",5,Superb,1268092800,"03 9, 2010",2010,4093,"['Hurt', 'Locker', 'currently', 'most', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'film', '2009', 'seeing', 'just', 'week', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'agree', 'acclamation', 'wholeheartedly', 'really', 'work', 'art', 'start', 'finish', 'now', 'been', 'moved', 'top', 'list', 'movies', 'own', 'cherish', 'forever', 'release', 'won', 'numerous', 'awards', '9', 'Academy', 'award', 'nominations', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'win', 'come', 'ceremony', 'March', 'cast', 'comprises', 'unknowns', 'are', 'ones', 'very', 'familiar', 'as', 'doing', 'bit', 'research', 'few', 'actors', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'minor', 'roles', 'other', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'leap', 'big', 'time', 'then', 'well', 'deserved.During', 'early', 'stages', 'Iraq', 'war', '2004', 'film', '3', 'member', 'EOD', 'Explosives', 'Ordinance', 'Disposal', 'unit', 'go', 'missions', 'providing', 'cover', 'one', 'member', 'Sergeant', 'First', 'Class', 'William', 'James', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'IED', 'Improvised', 'Explosive', 'Devices', 'James', 'behaviour', 'rushing', 'blast', 'radius', 'sending', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'robot', 'first', 'being', 'labelled', 'reckless', 'fellow', 'officers', 'Sergeant', 'JT', 'Sanborn', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Specialist', 'Owen', 'Eldridge', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'image', 'reckless', 'officer', 'negative', 'effect', 'team', 'dynamic', 'film', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'aware', 'individual', 'reasons', 'why', 'character', 'way', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'follow', 'plot', 'sense', 'team', 'must', 'solve', 'form', 'deep', 'seeded', 'puzzle', 'mastermind', 'bombs', 'unit', 'specifically', 'simply', 'trio', 'officers', 'do', 'same', 'job', 'being', 'done', 'real', 'Iraq', 'touches', 'how', 'officers', 'deal', 'situations', 'find', 'director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'wanted', 'film', 'immerse', 'viewer', 'something', 'was', 'Raw', 'immediate', 'Visceral', 'certainly', 'achieved', 'perfectly', 'scenes', 'may', 'seem', 'slow', ""'re"", 'slow', 'purpose', 'be', 'aware', 'anything', 'can', 'change', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'slight', 'stint', 'calm', 'silence', 'can', 'change', 'instant', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'done.Although', 'actors', 'may', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'others', ""'m"", 'happy', 'way', ""n't"", 'cast', 'megastars', 'playing', 'roles', 'movie', 'had', 'cast', 'consisted', 'likes', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'example', 'then', 'film', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'impact', 'would', 'watch', 'purpose', 'rather', 'simply', 'watching', 'story', 'why', 'be', 'revolution', 'sorts', 'more', 'more', 'most', 'critically', 'successful', 'films', 'containing', 'unknown', 'little', 'known', 'actors', 'rather', 'big', 'names', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Jordan', 'Kuwait', 'had', 'really', 'authentic', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'overall', 'well', 'deserving', 'praise', 'one', 'gripe', 'have', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'touched', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'unfairly', 'gave', '1', 'star', 'just', 'due', 'point', 'alone', 'way', 'British', 'servicemen', 'were', 'portrayed', 'middle', 'film', 'was', 'terribly', 'offensive', 'overly', 'typical', 'point', 'had', 'expected', 'happen', 'point', 'film', 'even', 'switching', 'have', 'been', 'mountains', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'last', 'make', 'such', 'mistake', 'other', 'side', 'argument', 'would', 'almost', 'expect', 'English', 'film', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'Americans', 'regardless', 'how', 'serious', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'did', 'find', 'slightly', 'offensive', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'damage', 'view', 'film', 'whole', 'still', 'support', 'being', 'sublime.Shockingly', 'brilliant', 'let', 'down', 'one', 'particular', 'scene', 'film', 'overall', 'was', 'superb', 'Blu-Ray', 'film', 'especially', 'done', 'justice', 'detail', 'resolution', 'just', 'visually', 'own', 'right', 'Buy', 'rent', 'watch', 'friend', 'house', 'definitely', 'film', 'see']",N/A

1252528,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B00275EGWY,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 4]","This is an action packed film that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. The characters are propelled from one risky situation to the next without much of a break between. The film is about a bomb removal or disposal unit who must deal with the vast proliferation of IEDs set by the insurgents for our young soldiers. The fact that these IEDs are produced using diverted military supplies is beyond tragic incompetence.Jeremy Renner is superb as Sergeant James, a fascinating character who seems driven for many reasons to take outrageous risks when dismantling IEDs. He is contrasted with Sergeant Sanborn, the voice of reason and experience, which is highly annoyed by excessive risk taking. Most viewers would identify with Sergeant Sanborn's common sense in the face of ever changing risks. A third fellow, Specialist Eldridge, is also a character with whom many may identify, for he knows that war in Iraq had become insane and he struggles to mentally hold himself together under the stress.I found this film to be highly entertaining with a compelling story and realistic characters in challenging situations. I loved Black Hawk Down and found this film to be as good a film. A year in the life of a bomb disposal unit would be a terrible year for each day presented new life threatening situations, often ambiguous signals, and ever changing risks. When I read the other reviews, particularly those folks who gave the film low marks, I found that most of the complaints were highly technical and detail oriented. In other words, for the film to get it right, every detail about military operations must be exactly portrayed. I am not sure I agree with this since the essence of the film, the messages conveyed, seemed authentic and fair. The American soldiers were portrayed with a sense of fair play and balance. I actually found some of the negative reviews to be educational, particularly those reviewers who have served in Iraq and who had detailed criticism of various aspects of the film. But these same reviewers rarely concerned themselves with the underlying character development and sequence of events that came together in this portrayal of one slice of the war in Iraq.The film does an excellent job of conveying the almost impossible task our soldiers faced in a country undergoing a civil war and filled with insurgency. In civil war horrors are inflicted on citizens by citizens, as gruesomely conveyed in scenes in this film. When dealing with insurgency, it is impossible to tell if the man smiling at you is about to kill you, again as this film perfectly portrayed. The film also stays away from politics and political statements and it does this by focusing on the Iraqi people and settings and the American soldiers and their predicaments. In actuality, this made more of a moral and ethical statement than any political statement could make.",5,Iraq from the perspective of those on the front lines,1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,2893,"['action', 'packed', 'film', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat', 'entire', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'propelled', 'one', 'risky', 'situation', 'next', 'much', 'break', 'film', 'bomb', 'removal', 'disposal', 'unit', 'who', 'must', 'deal', 'vast', 'proliferation', 'IEDs', 'set', 'insurgents', 'young', 'soldiers', 'fact', 'IEDs', 'are', 'produced', 'using', 'diverted', 'military', 'supplies', 'tragic', 'incompetence.Jeremy', 'Renner', 'superb', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'fascinating', 'character', 'who', 'driven', 'many', 'reasons', 'take', 'outrageous', 'risks', 'when', 'dismantling', 'IEDs', 'contrasted', 'Sergeant', 'Sanborn', 'voice', 'reason', 'experience', 'highly', 'annoyed', 'excessive', 'risk', 'taking', 'Most', 'viewers', 'would', 'identify', 'Sergeant', 'Sanborn', 'common', 'sense', 'face', 'ever', 'changing', 'risks', 'third', 'fellow', 'Specialist', 'Eldridge', 'also', 'character', 'whom', 'many', 'may', 'identify', 'war', 'Iraq', 'had', 'become', 'insane', 'mentally', 'hold', 'together', 'stress.I', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'compelling', 'story', 'realistic', 'characters', 'challenging', 'situations', 'loved', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'year', 'life', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'unit', 'would', 'be', 'terrible', 'year', 'day', 'presented', 'new', 'life', 'threatening', 'situations', 'often', 'ambiguous', 'signals', 'ever', 'changing', 'risks', 'When', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'particularly', 'folks', 'who', 'gave', 'film', 'low', 'marks', 'found', 'most', 'complaints', 'were', 'highly', 'technical', 'detail', 'oriented', 'other', 'words', 'film', 'get', 'right', 'detail', 'military', 'operations', 'must', 'be', 'exactly', 'portrayed', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'agree', 'essence', 'film', 'messages', 'conveyed', 'seemed', 'authentic', 'fair', 'American', 'soldiers', 'were', 'portrayed', 'sense', 'fair', 'play', 'balance', 'actually', 'found', 'negative', 'reviews', 'be', 'educational', 'particularly', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'served', 'Iraq', 'who', 'had', 'detailed', 'criticism', 'various', 'aspects', 'film', 'same', 'reviewers', 'rarely', 'concerned', 'underlying', 'character', 'development', 'sequence', 'events', 'came', 'together', 'portrayal', 'one', 'slice', 'war', 'Iraq.The', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'conveying', 'almost', 'impossible', 'task', 'soldiers', 'faced', 'country', 'undergoing', 'civil', 'war', 'filled', 'insurgency', 'civil', 'war', 'horrors', 'are', 'inflicted', 'citizens', 'citizens', 'gruesomely', 'conveyed', 'scenes', 'film', 'When', 'dealing', 'insurgency', 'impossible', 'tell', 'man', 'smiling', 'kill', 'again', 'film', 'perfectly', 'portrayed', 'film', 'also', 'away', 'politics', 'political', 'statements', 'focusing', 'Iraqi', 'people', 'settings', 'American', 'soldiers', 'predicaments', 'actuality', 'made', 'more', 'moral', 'ethical', 'statement', 'political', 'statement', 'could', 'make']",N/A

1252530,AN9J46667D80O,B00275EGWY,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[2, 4]","""The Hurt Locker"" has just won the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture and it truly earns it. Here is a war movie that takes no real position on war, and especially no position on the Iraq War, and simply shows the mental and physical brutality and beauty of conflict.You know the story by now. It centers around a bomb disposal and disarmament team in Iraq who throw themselves into harm's way on a regular basis in order to make life safer for their fellow soldiers and civilians. The team receives a new member, played by the fantastic Jeremy Renner, who is something of a wild card. Soon he and everyone else are pulled into his own personal brand of insanity as he comes to realize that without the war, he's nothing.It's a simple concept and wonderfully executed by Kathryn Bigelow and her team. It was filmed on location in the Middle East and you really get a sense of what life is like that part of the world for our soldiers and the civilians who live there. You bear witness to some of the day-to-day tragedies that happen (admittedly not as much now as they did in 2004 when this movie is apparently set), like a man forced into a suicide bombing. It's a harrowing look at an unpleasant reality.I mention in the title of the review that it's an action movie where you dread the action. This is entirely true. You really start to become quite fond of the three bomb techs, and when the bullets start flying and things start exploding, you worry about them. You want nothing more than for them to go back to their base, nice and safe, and not venture out into the dangerous world. It's something I've not come across in an action-type film, and I'm glad to see it here.Was this actually the best movie of 2009? Well, yes. It won't have the long-term influence of ""Avatar"", but it is overall better than that film.

1252532,A30WXSK6N4J0CZ,B00275EGWY,Christian R. Unger,"[0, 0]","Hurt Locker is an amazing film. The feel / look of Iraq is amazing and looks right. And the message it sends about the effects war / combat has on some people's psyche is harrowing, but the film has major issues.First up, procedure wise the guys in this film come of as cowboys, winging it with no discipline. The portrayal of the main character being a renegade or cowboy (though all three main characters have issues) working to Hollywood cliche's is terrible. Secondly, the pacing isn't bad but the shifts in tone that affect the pacing are disruptive. The tone changes abruptly and similarly the speed at which events happen, for example: There is a scene where the guys get stuck in the desert sniping insurgents, waiting in cover for sunset. This is slow and painful and for the viewer this is okay. This is the ""gritty realism"" so many speak about in the context of this film, but then it moves on to drinking and the resulitng drunken fighting session between the characters, with no lead in or transition (well they do get back to base) but it grates.Then there is the event with a kid getting killed (or not) and the film attempts to make a statement about sentimentality and sensitivity (James) vs kindness and compassion (the CO / psychologist [this is a bit bizarre]), in both instances in the face of achieving the job. Predictably the movie now goes for the cliche'd ""futility of war"" and ""no good deed ever goes unpunished"", and then messes the later up ... sort of.There are no concrete statements in this film, everything is just a random thing until it finally clears things up at then end finally justifying the quote from the start (""war is a drug"") and giving context to some of the statements that are unsubstantiated in the film. And again it falls flat.There is a lot to like about this film, and in many ways it's heart is in the right place, but much like James's actions, they just don't achieve the desired goal. Gritty realism is confined to a few events and the look of the movie and some subtle moments of clarity, but by and large it is just a lick of paint that can't hide the misdirected movie made to a spec of Hollywood Gritty Realism (TM). And from there little can save it. Yes the direction is good, the camera work is mostly okay (again, to achieve gritty realism certain things are required, and they look terrible but fitting, let's just say it's to spec). Acting is ... shallow. It's not that the actors are doing a bad job, rather that the characters are so reduced to a single attribute (hardass, renegade and rookie), there is no acting being done here. They are just ... caricatures (and I'm not sure that can be praised).Maybe off topic, but style wise there is a lot of similarity to old cowboy movies, and I'm not certain it was the right look go with. This is likely a budget issue (only 15 million ... only ... how sad is it that 15 million qualifies as only ..., but given the hardware involved that probably explains a lot of the choices that drag the film down ... like a total of three Humvee's in the entire movie).So yeah, watching the film it does move you, but at the end you are filled with a big question: what's the point? Some guys are soldiers for the adrenalin rush. Not sure that needed a 2 hour movie with confused sub-messages.",2,"Powerful, moving but strangely empty",1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,3297,"['Hurt', 'Locker', 'amazing', 'film', 'feel', '/', 'look', 'Iraq', 'amazing', 'right', 'message', 'effects', 'war', '/', 'combat', 'people', 'psyche', 'harrowing', 'film', 'major', 'issues.First', 'up', 'procedure', 'wise', 'guys', 'film', 'come', 'cowboys', 'winging', 'discipline', 'portrayal', 'main', 'character', 'being', 'renegade', 'cowboy', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'issues', 'working', 'Hollywood', 'cliche', 'terrible', 'Secondly', 'pacing', ""n't"", 'bad', 'shifts', 'tone', 'affect', 'pacing', 'are', 'disruptive', 'tone', 'abruptly', 'similarly', 'speed', 'events', 'happen', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'guys', 'get', 'stuck', 'desert', 'sniping', 'insurgents', 'waiting', 'cover', 'sunset', 'slow', 'painful', 'viewer', 'okay', 'gritty', 'realism', 'so', 'many', 'speak', 'context', 'film', 'then', 'drinking', 'resulitng', 'fighting', 'session', 'characters', 'lead', 'transition', 'well', 'do', 'get', 'back', 'base', 'grates.Then', 'event', 'kid', 'getting', 'killed', 'not', 'film', 'attempts', 'make', 'statement', 'sentimentality', 'sensitivity', 'James', 'vs', 'kindness', 'compassion', 'CO', '/', 'psychologist', '[', 'bit', 'bizarre', ']', 'instances', 'face', 'achieving', 'job', 'Predictably', 'movie', 'now', 'cliche', ""'d"", 'futility', 'war', 'good', 'deed', 'ever', 'unpunished', 'then', 'later', 'up', 'sort', 'are', 'concrete', 'statements', 'film', 'everything', 'just', 'random', 'thing', 'finally', 'things', 'up', 'then', 'end', 'finally', 'justifying', 'quote', 'start', 'war', 'drug', 'giving', 'context', 'statements', 'are', 'unsubstantiated', 'film', 'again', 'flat.There', 'lot', 'like', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'much', 'James', 'actions', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'achieve', 'desired', 'goal', 'Gritty', 'realism', 'confined', 'few', 'events', 'look', 'movie', 'subtle', 'moments', 'clarity', 'large', 'just', 'lick', 'paint', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'misdirected', 'movie', 'made', 'spec', 'Hollywood', 'Gritty', 'Realism', 'TM', 'there', 'little', 'can', 'save', 'Yes', 'direction', 'good', 'camera', 'work', 'mostly', 'okay', 'again', 'achieve', 'gritty', 'realism', 'certain', 'things', 'are', 'required', 'look', 'terrible', 'fitting', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'spec', 'Acting', 'shallow', 'not', 'actors', 'are', 'doing', 'bad', 'job', 'rather', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'reduced', 'single', 'attribute', 'hardass', 'renegade', 'rookie', 'acting', 'being', 'done', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'caricatures', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'be', 'praised', '.Maybe', 'topic', 'style', 'wise', 'lot', 'similarity', 'old', 'cowboy', 'movies', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'was', 'right', 'look', 'go', 'likely', 'budget', 'issue', 'only', '15', 'million', 'only', 'how', 'sad', '15', 'million', 'qualifies', 'only', 'given', 'hardware', 'involved', 'probably', 'lot', 'choices', 'drag', 'film', 'down', 'total', 'three', 'Humvee', 'entire', 'movie', '.So', 'yeah', 'watching', 'film', 'move', 'end', 'are', 'filled', 'big', 'question', 'what', 'point', 'guys', 'are', 'soldiers', 'adrenalin', 'rush', 'Not', 'sure', 'needed', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'confused', 'sub-messages']",N/A

It recently won the Oscar for Best Picture and Best Director, along with four others, and deservingly so. It's made with a precision and craft that is unique and outstanding, and it's also very intense and entertaining.The three main leads played by Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty are all convincing as members of a bomb disposal team at the height of violence in the Iraq war. They move from mission to mission in dangerous situations where their individual personalities and the way they deal with the trauma of war come out. Renner is particularly impressive as a bomb defusing expert who has a certain recklessness and even addiction to what he does.The directorial achievement by Kathryn Bigelow and the script by Mark Boal are no less impressive. There has been controversy over the realism in aspects of this movie, but to me it seemed completely believable. The suspenseful action scenes are done with complete clarity giving an amazing scope which heightens the dramatic effect. The stuff in between these sequences though are just as important, giving effective character development, like when Renner's character befriends an Iraqi boy who sells DVDs.The film is must see. I've seen it twice and will definitely watch it many more times.  It works great as a drama, as a thriller, and as an action movie. Some have asked what the movie is really about.

This started in the opening scene, where the sophisticated robot is pulling a flimsy handcart that falls apart at the first obstacle. The worst scene has to be the sniper scenario, where an incompetent British SAS team is wiped out by Iraqi snipers from 800 yards using AK47's and the heroic Americans promptly show that they are also trained snipers, capable of hitting a moving target at nearly 1000 yards range! The movie can only go downhill from here and of course it does, with a ridiculous scene where our hero goes out after dark in combat fatigues on a futile mission to try and find ""Beckham's"" killers and then calmly walks through Baghdad without getting a scratch.

1252538,A18D0R137EYS6C,B00275EGWY,Clinton Enlow,"[6, 8]","I've been a Kathryn Bigelow since Strange Days. I'll admit in a career thats included Point Break and Near Dark, thats not a real good statement, but truthfully thats the first film of hers I saw as a young adult and one that made an impression on me. Now years later and having seen films of hers like the aforementioned ones I can be impressed with this impressive director breaking a mold in the action film market and making some of the best guy movies ever. I had been waiting for The Hurt Locker since hearing about it a couple of years ago. I'll admit I don't watch too many movies on the Iraq war, but with Bigelow in the directors seat and a story that wasn't aiming for a political angle I perked up. I didn't see many movies in theatres this year, but seeing something like this in theatres missing out on Transformers or Wolverine didn't matter that much.As it is The Hurt Locker is a rather simple story focusing on an EOD's tour that is quickly coming to an end. The first nine minutes sets up what the movie will be with a tense scene where a simple job goes awry when a man steps out of a door holding what might be cell phone. Its an incredibly tense little scene thats topped easily by others.But more than the scenes the movie is brilliantly about character, two in particular. The first is the main one, William James, a loose cannon maverick who puts himself in harms way knowingly, taking chances and generally putting the other two members of his team in a flux. JT Sanborn is more of a straight arrow who does things by the book because He wants to survive his tour doing his job the way He was trained to. And Owen Eldridge is the younger member of the team quietly suffering from the deaths He's witnessed and seeking therapy from Col. Cambridge.Thats a basic rundown of the story, three characters surviving a bevy of engagements and the way they interact with each other. While Eldridge is a good character the real meat of the story comes between the conflict between Sanborn and James escalating in a final scenes where both Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie really excelled in my opinion. Better though was a final scene following James at a banal home life, cleaning out his storm drains and grocery shopping with his wife. Theres a small bit of dialogue with Jeremy Renner speaking to infant son that put the movie in some of the same territory as Bigelow's Point Break, only on a more dramatic footing. For this small scene alone I would be suprised if Renner doesn't recieve a large ammount of nominations. Bigelow as well deserves a lot of credit in trying to ground the movie in some sort of reality, building most of the action around suspense instead of simple action- check out the sniper scene, the only gunfight of the movie as the team bonds trading shots with gunmen.Truthfully the movie is far from perfect with a few scenes that did stretch credibility. I'll admit I'm not a soldier so I won't argue the truth with a few scenes. Then again the film is still a movie and a few scenes are a minor quibble on what is otherwise a great film, well worth your time.I should add this since I did eventually pick up the Blu-Ray. Sadly the features are the same as the DVD from a good commentary to a very small making of. Picture wise I found the DVD a bit brighter but the Blu Ray does have an incredibly detailed image. While it was darker I would describe it as being more realistic in color and sharpness. I'm not very good about judgement on these things but while it might not astound the picture and audio quality is very well produced.",4,The Hurt Locker,1257206400,"11 3, 2009",2009,3580,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'Strange', 'Days', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'career', 'thats', 'included', 'Point', 'Break', 'Near', 'Dark', 'not', 'real', 'good', 'statement', 'truthfully', 'first', 'film', 'hers', 'saw', 'young', 'adult', 'one', 'made', 'impression', 'Now', 'years', 'later', 'having', 'seen', 'films', 'hers', 'aforementioned', 'ones', 'can', 'be', 'impressed', 'impressive', 'director', 'breaking', 'mold', 'action', 'film', 'market', 'making', 'best', 'guy', 'movies', 'ever', 'had', 'been', 'waiting', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'hearing', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'too', 'many', 'movies', 'Iraq', 'war', 'Bigelow', 'directors', 'seat', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'aiming', 'political', 'angle', 'perked', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'many', 'movies', 'theatres', 'year', 'seeing', 'something', 'theatres', 'missing', 'out', 'Transformers', 'Wolverine', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'much.As', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'rather', 'simple', 'story', 'focusing', 'EOD', 'tour', 'quickly', 'coming', 'end', 'first', 'nine', 'minutes', 'up', 'what', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'tense', 'scene', 'where', 'simple', 'job', 'awry', 'when', 'man', 'door', 'holding', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'cell', 'phone', 'incredibly', 'tense', 'little', 'scene', 'thats', 'topped', 'easily', 'others.But', 'more', 'scenes', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'character', 'two', 'particular', 'first', 'main', 'one', 'William', 'James', 'loose', 'cannon', 'maverick', 'who', 'harms', 'way', 'knowingly', 'taking', 'chances', 'generally', 'putting', 'other', 'two', 'members', 'team', 'flux', 'JT', 'Sanborn', 'more', 'straight', 'arrow', 'who', 'things', 'book', 'survive', 'tour', 'doing', 'job', 'way', 'was', 'trained', 'Owen', 'Eldridge', 'younger', 'member', 'team', 'quietly', 'suffering', 'deaths', 'witnessed', 'seeking', 'therapy', 'Col.', 'Cambridge.Thats', 'basic', 'rundown', 'story', 'three', 'characters', 'surviving', 'bevy', 'engagements', 'way', 'interact', 'other', 'Eldridge', 'good', 'character', 'real', 'meat', 'story', 'conflict', 'Sanborn', 'James', 'escalating', 'final', 'scenes', 'where', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'really', 'excelled', 'opinion', 'Better', 'was', 'final', 'scene', 'following', 'James', 'banal', 'home', 'life', 'cleaning', 'out', 'storm', 'drains', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'wife', 'small', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'speaking', 'infant', 'son', 'put', 'movie', 'same', 'territory', 'Bigelow', 'Point', 'Break', 'only', 'more', 'dramatic', 'footing', 'small', 'scene', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'suprised', 'Renner', ""n't"", 'recieve', 'large', 'ammount', 'nominations', 'Bigelow', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'credit', 'trying', 'ground', 'movie', 'sort', 'reality', 'building', 'most', 'action', 'suspense', 'instead', 'simple', 'action-', 'check', 'sniper', 'scene', 'only', 'gunfight', 'movie', 'team', 'bonds', 'trading', 'shots', 'gunmen.Truthfully', 'movie', 'far', 'perfect', 'few', 'scenes', 'did', 'stretch', 'credibility', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'soldier', 'wo', ""n't"", 'argue', 'truth', 'few', 'scenes', 'Then', 'again', 'film', 'still', 'movie', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'minor', 'quibble', 'what', 'otherwise', 'great', 'film', 'well', 'time.I', 'should', 'add', 'did', 'eventually', 'pick', 'up', 'Blu-Ray', 'Sadly', 'features', 'are', 'same', 'DVD', 'good', 'commentary', 'very', 'small', 'making', 'Picture', 'wise', 'found', 'DVD', 'bit', 'brighter', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'have', 'incredibly', 'detailed', 'image', 'was', 'darker', 'would', 'describe', 'being', 'more', 'realistic', 'color', 'sharpness', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'good', 'judgement', 'things', 'might', 'not', 'astound', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'very', 'well', 'produced']",N/A

1252541,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B00275EGWY,Craig Whittle,"[3, 5]","HURT LOCKER, THESTARRING: Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty, Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and David MorseWRITTEN BY: Mark BoalDIRECTED BY: Kathryn BigelowRated: RGenre: Action / ThrillerRelease Date: 26 June 2009It pains me to say that I missed The Hurt Locker in theaters. On my first viewing of the film, I remember enjoying it but thinking it was not worthy of the Oscar for best picture over Up in the Air, Avatar or Inglourious Basterds. Having seen it recently for a second time that feeling remains intact; but now I can proudly consider it worthy of its place among the top five best films of 2009. If you haven't yet seen it, you seriously need to.The Hurt Locker holds a place dear to me on a few personal levels. The first being that it is an independent film (a world that I myself am entering into); and the second is that its story centers on soldiers fighting in the Middle East (something of which I have experience in).Jeremy Renner earns his first of two Oscar nominations as Sergeant James; an EOD bomb tech who is a little too proud of his work ethic for the comfort of his comrades. And for those of you who aren't familiar with the term EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal), they are an elite group of soldiers whose sole mission is to find and disarm bombs. And I'll give you another one up front: an IED is an improvised explosive device. The story takes place back in a 2004 Baghdad, Iraq.After their bomb tech is killed in an explosion, Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are awarded with a new one: Sergeant James. Eldridge and Sanborn had a good thing going, they work by the book, and they're but a few weeks shy of going home.So when James comes into the picture with his carefree tactics and cocky attitude; they are a little on edge. That James is efficiently skilled and gifted at what he does only makes matters worse for all three of them; because James is very aware that he posses these skills, and takes great joy in the adrenaline rush they reward him with.Sanborn and James butt heads from the get-go and Sanborn quickly realizes his last few weeks are going to be among his longest. Imagine working with someone who is very good at what they do, but their cockiness is sure to get you and them fired, and they don't seem to be the least bit concerned. Now amp up the volume on that little scenario by replacing the word fired with the word killed.James smokes frequently (even when handling dangerous explosive materials), he's all too eager to get his hands dirty when the situation doesn't necessarily call for it, and he doesn't seem to have much to live for other than the thrill of the job. And he likes to take his time when defusing these bombs, regardless of the fact that his team, himself included, are completely in the open and could be killed at any moment. The sheer fact that they are there to begin with, alerts massive suspicion to the townspeople.As nuts as this may seem, ask yourself if you were holding security for someone defusing a bomb; if you'd like that person to be as comfortable as possible when doing so. This is James' take on his work ethic, and it makes perfect sense.One thing you have to understand about the conflicts in the Middle East, whether it's Iraq or Afghanistan; the battlefield is everywhere. There is no safe point or zone; some are safer than others, sure. There is no one outside the wire you can fully trust: the enemy could be anyone, anywhere at any time, and they don't play by the rules. Harmless seeming objects such as cell phones, video cameras, and even kites, all have the potential of being tools of deadly destruction over there.The film rides on suspense driven scenes of: A. a guy defusing a bomb; and B. his security team surrounded by people who may want to kill them, may have the means to do so, and may be directly responsible and capable of detonating that very bomb. If that doesn't make for a good thriller, then I don't know what would.The Academy Award winning screenwriter (Mark Boal) spent time in Baghdad with a real EOD team and the film proves it. He nailed every detail from the soldier favorite juice boxes, to the Military jargon, to the shocking realization of just how far these people are willing to go to hide their IEDs in innovative ways.His goal here was not to make a big Hollywood action movie, but to tell a good story, and to stay true to the men and women who serve by keeping the film believable. There are a few Hollywood moments in the film for sure, but every single thing that happens could realistically happen in real life; maybe not to the same three guys, but hey.Mark's efforts are only matched perfectly by director Kathryn Bigelow who also won the Oscar for directing. They could have taken this project to a major studio who would have given them millions of dollars to film it in Arizona or Nevada. But instead they sought out investors overseas and filmed the movie independently and properly in the Middle East; and their hard work and commitment has paid off. There are six little shiny gold men resting on glamorous shelves somewhere, to prove it.",5,The Hurt Locker Review,1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,5147,"['HURT', 'LOCKER', 'THESTARRING', 'Jeremy',

I am an Air Force retiree who spent 27 years on active duty.  I understand why some of the discrepancies can be frustrating to those who have lived life in the military and see Hollywood not getting the details quite right.  I often note a lot of differences between life and life on screen in most movies with a military theme.  Uniforms aren't correct, haircuts are out of regulation, people wear hats indoors etc.However, with ""The Hurt Locker"", theses discrepancies shouldn't take away from the excellence of the movie.  The main theme of the movie is not about the details of existence in day to day military life in a war zone.  The director is trying to show how the effects of the cat and mouse existence in this type of combat affect the key characters.  Also of importance is the relationships between them.  The acting by the the trio who make up the Explosive Ordnance Disposal--EOD--team (Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty) is excellent.  I can certainly relate to how Jeremy Renner's character, Sergeant James, feels when he goes home to his wife and child after tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.  You get the feeling that he can't adapt to the humble role of husband and father and actually misses the near addiction he has to the adrenaline rush of being the key EOD team member.  You also get the feeling he can't and won't be able to find anyone to relate to his experiences.  I grew up in Iowa and when I came home on leave, I really couldn't talk about my assignments with friends and family because they had no real concept of what I was talking about.  The pain within the story primarily comes from the two other members of the EOD team, who are really just trying to survive their tours and get away from a job they dislike in a country (Iraq) they hate--hopeful to get home in one piece.In addition to the superb acting by the three lead characters, the cameo appearances by Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes added an air of actor familiarity and credibility; and the astute direction of Kathryn Bigelow brought the story and characters together brilliantly.I did knock off a star for the discrepancies some other reviewers pointed out, but I think this film is deserving of the many accolades it received, including the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, and should be viewed by anyone interested in the effects of war on the psyche of some of those involved.",4,"Plenty of Pain in ""The Hurt Locker""",1285372800,"09 25, 2010",2010,2513,"['have', 'read', 'reviews', 'vets', 'Operations', 'Enduring', 'Freedom', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraqi', 'Freedom', 'am', 'Air', 'Force', 'retiree', 'who', 'spent', '27', 'years', 'active', 'duty', 'understand', 'why', 'discrepancies', 'can', 'be', 'frustrating', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'life', 'military', 'see', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'getting', 'details', 'quite', 'right', 'often', 'note', 'lot', 'differences', 'life', 'life', 'screen', 'most', 'movies', 'military', 'theme', 'Uniforms', 'are', ""n't"", 'correct', 'haircuts', 'are', 'regulation', 'people', 'wear', 'hats', 'indoors', 'etc.However', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'discrepancies', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'excellence', 'movie', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'not', 'details', 'existence', 'day', 'day', 'military', 'life', 'war', 'zone', 'director', 'trying', 'show', 'how', 'effects', 'cat', 'mouse', 'existence', 'type', 'combat', 'affect', 'key', 'characters', 'Also', 'importance', 'relationships', 'acting', 'trio', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'Explosive', 'Ordnance', 'Disposal', 'EOD', 'team', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'excellent', 'can', 'certainly', 'relate', 'how', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'character', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'feels', 'when', 'home', 'wife', 'child', 'tours', 'Afghanistan', 'Iraq', 'get', 'feeling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'adapt', 'humble', 'role', 'husband', 'father', 'actually', 'near', 'addiction', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'being', 'key', 'EOD', 'team', 'member', 'also', 'get', 'feeling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'find', 'anyone', 'relate', 'experiences', 'grew', 'up', 'Iowa', 'when', 'came', 'home', 'leave', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'talk', 'assignments', 'friends', 'family', 'had', 'real', 'concept', 'what', 'was', 'talking', 'pain', 'story', 'primarily', 'two', 'other', 'members', 'EOD', 'team', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'just', 'trying', 'survive', 'tours', 'get', 'away', 'job', 'dislike', 'country', 'Iraq', 'hate', 'hopeful', 'get', 'home', 'one', 'piece.In', 'addition', 'superb', 'acting', 'three', 'lead', 'characters', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'David', 'Morse', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'added', 'air', 'actor', 'familiarity', 'credibility', 'astute', 'direction', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'brought', 'story', 'characters', 'together', 'brilliantly.I', 'did', 'knock', 'off', 'star', 'discrepancies', 'other', 'reviewers', 'pointed', 'out', 'think', 'film', 'deserving', 'many', 'accolades', 'received', 'including', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'anyone', 'interested', 'effects', 'war', 'psyche', 'involved']",N/A

1252545,A1RD1LL5E5JZOT,B00275EGWY,"Crookedmouth "":-/""","[6, 9]","Set in modern Baghdad, The Hurt Locker follows the lives of three of the US Army's bomb disposal technicians as they battle insurgent bombers and their own nerves to stay alive in the world's most dangerous war zone.The Hurt Locker was directed by Kathryn Bigelow (Blue Steel, Point Break) and, released in 2008 to much fanfare and critical acclaim, it was nominated for nine Oscars and eventually won six. It's hard, now, to see what the fuss was about. It is a fairly conventional war movie, typical Hollywood fare in fact and I can see nothing about it that lifts above the herd and it is certainly not the equal of, for instance,Saving Private Ryan,Das BootorPlatoon.Yes, it's well shot and composed, effectively conveying the dusty, sweaty, grimy life of a soldier in Iraq. Indeed, there are some award winning individual shots (the slo-mo explosion sequence where the dust jumps off the roof of a car is particularly tasty) but the ensemble is barely above the ordinary -Three Kingsdid it just as well.It's well acted. Jeremy Renner does a fine job as the maverick bomb disposal tech (you may be able to guess where I'm going to go with this), Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty convince as his strung-out support crew and there are some surprising (and brief) cameos from Ralph Fiennes, David Morse and Guy Pearce. But, again, the acting is merely convincing: steely eyes, square jaws, head-in-hands-despair... all that sort of thing.The story, I'm afraid, is what lets the film down. The word ""maverick"" really should be banned from use in Hollywood these days (Tom Cruise and Tony Scotthave so much to answer for). It really does a profound disservice to the exeptional bravery and professionalism of bomb disposal technicians of all nationalities to see the lead character yank a cluster of IED's from the ground by their detonating cords, opening the boot of an explosive-laden car by means of a hefty kick or letting off a smoke grenade as he approaches the danger zone ""to create a diversion"". There are plenty of other military mess-ups; some of these are clearly excusable cinematographic necessities (soldiers standing around in groups, M113 armoured personnel carriers instead of Bradleys and so-on). However, plenty of others are inexcusably sloppy and betray the absence of a decent (or any) military advisor. I was particularly offended when the three main characters rushed off alone and on foot into the hostile night-time suburbs to track down a bomber... and then split up because ""we can cover more ground that way"" for heavens' sake! If the US Army really operate like this (and I cannot convince my self that they do) there is hardly any surprise that the war has lasted so long and achieved so little as it has.In the end, this is a deeply ordinary film and it is prone to many of the usual war movie cliches; tensions between the maverick and his by-the-book colleague ultimately resolved, friendship with with the local street urchin, the race against time, shall I cut the red wire or the blue wire? oh the horror! oh the humanity! think of the children!Without the hype it would have made a fairly decent war movie and I would happily have given it three stars. Because of the hype, my sensibilities are offended and I can only give it two.If you really want to know what it is like to be an EOD officer in Iraq, there are plenty of decent memoirs -Eight Lives Downbeing a decent place to start.",2,Just cut the bl00dy green wire and be done with it!,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,3426,"['Set', 'modern', 'Baghdad', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'lives', 'three', 'US', 'Army', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'technicians', 'battle', 'insurgent', 'bombers', 'own', 'nerves', 'stay', 'alive', 'world', 'most', 'dangerous', 'war', 'zone.The', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'was', 'directed', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'Blue', 'Steel', 'Point', 'Break', 'released', '2008', 'much', 'fanfare', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'was', 'nominated', 'nine', 'Oscars', 'eventually', 'won', 'six', 'hard', 'now', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'was', 'about', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'war', 'movie', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'fact', 'can', 'see', 'nothing', 'herd', 'certainly', 'not', 'equal', 'instance', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Das', 'BootorPlatoon.Yes', 'well', 'shot', 'composed', 'effectively', 'conveying', 'dusty', 'sweaty', 'grimy', 'life', 'soldier', 'Iraq', 'Indeed', 'are', 'award', 'winning', 'individual', 'shots', 'slo-mo', 'explosion', 'sequence', 'where', 'dust', 'roof', 'car', 'particularly', 'tasty', 'ensemble', 'barely', 'ordinary', '-Three', 'Kingsdid', 'just', 'well.It', 'well', 'acted', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'fine', 'job', 'maverick', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'tech', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'guess', 'where', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'convince', 'strung-out', 'support', 'crew', 'are', 'surprising', 'brief', 'cameos', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'David', 'Morse', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'again', 'acting', 'merely', 'convincing', 'steely', 'eyes', 'square', 'jaws', 'head-in-hands-despair', 'sort', 'thing.The', 'story', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'what', 'film', 'down', 'word', 'maverick', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'banned', 'use', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Tony', 'Scotthave', 'so', 'much', 'answer', 'really', 'profound', 'disservice', 'exeptional', 'bravery', 'professionalism', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'technicians', 'nationalities', 'see', 'lead', 'character', 'yank', 'cluster', 'IED', 'ground', 'detonating', 'cords', 'opening', 'boot', 'explosive-laden', 'car', 'means', 'hefty', 'kick', 'letting', 'off', 'smoke', 'grenade', 'danger', 'zone', 'create', 'diversion', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'military', 'mess-ups', 'are', 'clearly', 'excusable', 'cinematographic', 'necessities', 'soldiers', 'standing', 'around', 'groups', 'M113', 'armoured', 'personnel', 'carriers', 'instead', 'Bradleys', 'so-on', 'However', 'plenty', 'others', 'are', 'inexcusably', 'sloppy', 'absence', 'decent', 'military', 'advisor', 'was', 'particularly', 'offended', 'when', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'rushed', 'alone', 'foot', 'hostile', 'night-time', 'suburbs', 'track', 'down', 'bomber', 'then', 'split', 'up', 'can', 'cover', 'more', 'ground', 'way', 'heavens', 'sake', 'US', 'Army', 'really', 'operate', 'can', 'not', 'convince', 'self', 'do', 'hardly', 'surprise', 'war', 'lasted', 'so', 'long', 'achieved', 'so', 'little', 'end', 'deeply', 'ordinary', 'film', 'prone', 'many', 'usual', 'war', 'movie', 'cliches', 'tensions', 'maverick', 'by-the-book', 'colleague', 'ultimately', 'resolved', 'friendship', 'local', 'street', 'urchin', 'race', 'time', 'shall', 'cut', 'red', 'wire', 'blue', 'wire', 'horror', 'humanity', 'think', 'children', 'hype', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'fairly', 'decent', 'war', 'movie', 'would', 'happily', 'have', 'given', 'three', 'stars', 'hype', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'offended', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'two.If', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'EOD', 'officer', 'Iraq', 'are', 'plenty', 'decent', 'memoirs', '-Eight', 'Lives', 'Downbeing', 'decent', 'place', 'start']",N/A

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[1, 3]","Blessed with an insightful script by journalist Mark Boal, director Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) has finally found superior material to apply her talents, and the result is a seminal war film set in Iraq.  This is not the spectacle of war in broad strokes but rather an intimate point of view.  As such, it provides a very personal, visceral experience.In the middle of the Iraq War, Sgt. J T Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) welcomes a replacement for a fallen comrade.  The new soldier, Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner), is a quirky soul whose specialty is disarming bombs.  38 days are left for Bravo Company as the group sets out to diffuse a bomb.  While an automated robot might be appropriate, James insists on doing the job himself and finds a booby trap in the city streets.  After a tense period and an unexpected surprise, he is successful but not before spooking Sanborn and the other soldiers nearby.  His boldness and gambling has serious consequences for his comrades.James is a loose cannon, but does he have a death wish?  He has the emotional and physical scars from war, and he lives and breathes bombs to the point of keeping bomb parts as souvenirs.  He is addicted to the job, and war gives his life meaning.  He is the perfect war junkie.  It's a high stress existence and the only person a soldier can rely on is his fellow soldier.  These men bond amid difficult life and death situations while there is barely a shot fired.  This is most definitely not Audie Murphy's kind of war.The risks escalate when a car loaded with explosives is set afire and as James tries to disarm the device, the soldiers attract a lot of attention from the locals who may or may not be innocent observers.  It becomes a precarious situation by the minute as James' expertise is tested to the limit.  We witness the risks of guerilla warfare as threats come from around any street corner.As days melt down to hours, the tension becomes almost unbearable, and you can feel the anxiety and fear in these men.  There is an arduous sequence as the group gets pinned down by deadly sniper fire amid an oppressive sun.  Later, a heartbreaking scene has James attempting to defuse a bomb strapped to an innocent civilian pleading for his life.  It's a desperate task as the seconds tick away.  The emotions and the impossibility of the situation make for a compelling moment.James has a wife and son back home where he discovers some truths about himself.  Finding civilian life difficult to adjust to, he realizes the one thing makes him feel alive, and that is a tour of duty.Some notable actors like Ralph Feinnes, Guy Pierce, and Evangeline Lilly appear in what are essentially throwaway cameos.  Mackie is good as a soldier whose priorities in life change dramatically through his deployment, and Brian Geraghty registers as a young soldier who cannot wait to return safely to the states.  But it is Renner who excels in the difficult role of a gifted, but troubled soldier.Bigelow has always been adept at films (Point Break, Blue Steel) with lead characters under extreme duress, and she milks each bomb sequence with measured, tightly edited cuts to agonizingly prolong and heighten the suspense.  She is schooling the public with pure cinematic technique.  We feel a bit detached from these men not because they are not well drawn but because the film tries to show events in a semi-documentary way especially in its generous use of handheld cameras that give the feel of news footage.This is not a perfect film.  It feels episodic at times, and perhaps that is the point: that war can be a series of moments of danger and uncertainty.  Also, we never fully realize or understand what makes James tick.  We know he is drawn to his job and is very good at what he does. But we never see into his psyche's attraction to this profession beyond the adrenaline rush.While the film may not accurately portray military tactics or protocal, it does capture the human emotions of impossibly difficult tasks amid a hostile environment.  Credit the filmmakers for exploring a fascinating aspect of warfare.  In terms of driving home the fear and effects of war on the common soldier, few films have ever been better.",4,THE HURT LOCKER and the Human Essence of War,1267747200,"03 5, 2010",2010,4206,"['Blessed', 'insightful', 'script', 'journalist', 'Mark', 'Boal', 'director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'Point', 'Break', 'finally', 'found', 'superior', 'material', 'apply', 'talents', 'result', 'seminal', 'war', 'film', 'set', 'Iraq', 'not', 'spectacle', 'war', 'broad', 'strokes', 'rather', 'intimate', 'point', 'view', 'such', 'very', 'personal', 'visceral', 'experience.In', 'middle', 'Iraq', 'War', 'Sgt', 'J', 'T', 'Sanborn', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'replacement', 'fallen', 'comrade', 'new', 'soldier', 'Sgt', 'William', 'James', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'quirky', 'soul', 'specialty', 'disarming', 'bombs', '38', 'days', 'are', 'left', 'Bravo', 'Company', 'group', 'out', 'diffuse', 'bomb', 'automated', 'robot', 'might', 'be', 'appropriate', 'James', 'doing', 'job', 'booby', 'trap', 'city', 'streets', 'tense', 'period', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'successful', 'not', 'spooking', 'Sanborn', 'other', 'soldiers', 'nearby', 'boldness', 'gambling', 'serious', 'consequences', 'comrades.James', 'loose', 'cannon', 'have', 'death', 'wish', 'emotional', 'physical', 'scars', 'war', 'breathes', 'bombs', 'point', 'keeping', 'bomb', 'parts', 'souvenirs', 'addicted', 'job', 'war', 'life', 'meaning', 'perfect', 'war', 'junkie', 'high', 'stress', 'existence', 'only', 'person', 'soldier', 'can', 'rely', 'fellow', 'soldier', 'men', 'bond', 'difficult', 'life', 'death', 'situations', 'barely', 'shot', 'fired', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'kind', 'war.The', 'risks', 'escalate', 'when', 'car', 'loaded', 'explosives', 'set', 'afire', 'James', 'disarm', 'device', 'soldiers', 'attract', 'lot', 'attention', 'locals', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'innocent', 'observers', 'precarious', 'situation', 'minute', 'James', 'expertise', 'tested', 'limit', 'witness', 'risks', 'guerilla', 'warfare', 'threats', 'come', 'street', 'corner.As', 'days', 'melt', 'down', 'hours', 'tension', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'can', 'feel', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'men', 'arduous', 'sequence', 'group', 'pinned', 'down', 'deadly', 'sniper', 'fire', 'oppressive', 'sun', 'Later', 'heartbreaking', 'scene', 'James', 'attempting', 'defuse', 'bomb', 'strapped', 'innocent', 'civilian', 'pleading', 'life', 'desperate', 'task', 'seconds', 'tick', 'away', 'emotions', 'impossibility', 'situation', 'make', 'compelling', 'moment.James', 'wife', 'son', 'back', 'home', 'where', 'truths', 'Finding', 'civilian', 'life', 'difficult', 'adjust', 'one', 'thing', 'feel', 'alive', 'tour', 'duty.Some', 'notable', 'actors', 'Ralph', 'Feinnes', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'appear', 'what', 'are', 'essentially', 'throwaway', 'cameos', 'Mackie', 'good', 'soldier', 'priorities', 'life', 'change', 'dramatically', 'deployment', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'registers', 'young', 'soldier', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'return', 'safely', 'states', 'Renner', 'who', 'excels', 'difficult', 'role', 'gifted', 'troubled', 'soldier.Bigelow', 'always', 'been', 'adept', 'films', 'Point', 'Break', 'Blue', 'Steel', 'lead', 'characters', 'extreme', 'duress', 'bomb', 'sequence', 'measured', 'tightly', 'edited', 'cuts', 'agonizingly', 'prolong', 'heighten', 'suspense', 'schooling', 'public', 'pure', 'cinematic', 'technique', 'feel', 'bit', 'detached', 'men', 'not', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'drawn', 'film', 'tries', 'show', 'events', 'semi-documentary', 'way', 'especially', 'generous', 'use', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'give', 'feel', 'news', 'footage.This', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'episodic', 'times', 'perhaps', 'point', 'war', 'can', 'be', 'series', 'moments', 'danger', 'uncertainty', 'Also', 'never', 'fully', 'realize', 'understand', 'what', 'James', 'tick', 'know', 'drawn', 'job', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'never', 'see', 'psyche', 'attraction', 'profession', 'adrenaline', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'accurately', 'portray', 'military', 'tactics', 'protocal', 'capture', 'human', 'emotions', 'impossibly', 'difficult', 'tasks', 'hostile', 'environment', 'Credit', 'filmmakers', 'exploring', 'fascinating', 'aspect', 'warfare', 'terms', 'driving', 'home', 'fear', 'effects', 'war', 'common', 'soldier', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'better']",N/A

1252548,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00275EGWY,DanD,"[0, 2]","Action film meets character study in Kathryn Bigelow's THE HURT LOCKER.  The film follows three members of an Army bomb squad (Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty, all excellent) as they bond and diffuse bombs.If the film has one main flaw, it's that there's no real plot; this will obviously be a deterrent to more mainstream war movie fans, who like bombs and bullets and blood, and not necessarily any sense or heart.  It will also be a disappointment to those who want a film that glorifies the war in Iraq, or those who want a film that demonizes it.And yet, it is these three main points that make THE HURT LOCKER such a treasure.  It isn't just bombs and bullets; yes, there are those, but this is a movie with heart.  Likewise, it isn't a ""war"" film per say; it is a human film, about the people who fight the war.  It actually manages not to take a political stance, which is a move so tedious I previously thought it impossible.  The film is about the characters (specifically Renner's Staff Sergeant James) and how they cope with their environment, and why they do what they do.  In fact, when something resembling a plot pokes its polished head in the second half, the film actually falters; but we quickly get back to the characters themselves, and everything ends on a high note.Needless to say, Bigelow's come up in the world.  We're talking about the director responsible for POINT BREAK, one of those action films (many of which star Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, or Gary Busey, come to think of it) that's only good because of how bad it is.  However, the directing behind LOCKER is spot-on; it feels real, it puts you on location.  The script by Mark Boal (the scribe behind the slightly more political, but still excellent, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH) is likewise solid, and the special effects are so real they're frightening.  Of course, a film couldn't be good without solid performances, and we get those here from everyone involved, from the three leads to cameo roles by Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Guy Pearce, and others.  THE HURT LOCKER winds up being one of those rare movies that is both vividly entertaining and emotionally powerful; it has genuine staying power.

The basic drama (it's not a documentary) follows three members of an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team, whose specialization is to find and defuse the infamous ""improvised explosive devices."" They find these devices under piles of trash, in human bodies, in the trunk of a car, and in the Green Zone. But there's a larger drama at work here, as we watch how three very different soldiers cope in very different ways with this job, and what it does to each of their psyches. In this sense, the film is far more personal than political. The film does an especially good job of showing how difficult it is in Iraq to distinguish between friend and foe.

1252552,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,B00275EGWY,DarthRad,"[261, 331]","The movie opens with the quote - ""the rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug""  (a modern paraphrase of Churchill's older and more famous maxim - ""there is nothing more exhilarating than to be shot at without result"")This is a thriller of a movie about a U.S. Army bomb disposal unit in Iraq and their daily grind in dealing with the IEDs and insurgents there.This movie does have several stars - but Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pierce, and Evangeline Lilly all have fairly small roles.  Blink, and you'll miss them.  Their presence in this movie is more a testament to director/producer Kathryn Bigelow's status in the entertainment industry than anything else.Jeremy Renner is Sergeant James, a bomb tech.  Unlike his affable predecessor, he is a wild man.  He seems not only indifferent to the dangers of his job, he absolutely revels in the dangers.  It is the ultimate in thrill seeking behavior, getting that dopamine surge in his brain.  Near the end of the movie, Sgt. James gets accused of being an adrenaline junkie, but we know now that the neurochemical at work here is dopamine.  Bomb disposal is not just a job for him, but his passion, his addiction, his reason for being in the Army.Renner's character ends up like a cross between Elmer Fudd, with his perpetually placid and slightly befuddled gaze, and Bugs Bunny, with his wile and lust for excitement and danger.His two partners in the unit, Sgt. Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge, who have to cover him and just want to survive their tour of duty, don't know quite how to deal with his determination to confront danger.  One wonders at why Sgt. James puts himself in danger, why he takes the extra risks to defuse a bomb when detonating it would do.  The scene that explains it all is when Sgt. James returns home to America one day and we see him doing the mundane chores of life as a civilian, cleaning out the rain gutters, cleaning up the kitchen, shopping with his wife and baby at the grocery store.  As he stares at an entire wall full of colorful cereal boxes stacked along a grocery store aisle,  a look of utter blankness, boredom, and despair fills his face.....nope, not for him, this dull life as a civilian....The movie's storyline is a series of daily missions, almost like a documentary or a TV series, each episode standing alone and yet building upon previous episodes, each one presenting a new danger, a new challenge, another piece of the puzzle that is the war in Iraq.What makes this movie work is the recreation of Iraq in this movie - it was filmed in Jordan with local Iraqi expatriates.  We feel the oppressive tension of the whole country, of not knowing who the bad guys are and where the next bomb or bullet is going to come  from.  We feel the fear and uncertainty of the American soldiers, caught between their desire to be the good guys and wanting to make nice with the local Iraqis,  while constantly needing to remain vigilant and suspicious,  never knowing who is a good Iraqi, and who deserves to get shot.  We feel the bewilderment and resentment of the local Iraqis, who get pushed around at every turn by the American soldiers.Unlike so many other recent Iraq war movies, this movie makes no political statements, there is no right or wrong here.  These are just men at work, doing a dangerous and dirty job, and these guys are darn good at what they do for their country, whatever the reasons are that they are doing it.",5,Taut war drama exploring the psychology of soldiering,1245974400,"06 26, 2009",2009,3454,"['movie', 'quote', 'rush', 'battle', 'often', 'potent', 'lethal', 'addiction', 'war', 'drug', 'modern', 'paraphrase', 'Churchill', 'older', 'more', 'famous', 'maxim', 'nothing', 'more', 'exhilarating', 'be', 'shot', 'result', 'thriller', 'movie', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'unit', 'Iraq', 'daily', 'grind', 'dealing', 'IEDs', 'insurgents', 'there.This', 'movie', 'have', 'several', 'stars', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'have', 'fairly', 'small', 'roles', 'Blink', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'presence', 'movie', 'more', 'testament', 'director/producer', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'status', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'anything', 'else.Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'bomb', 'tech', 'affable', 'predecessor', 'wild', 'man', 'not', 'only', 'indifferent', 'dangers', 'job', 'absolutely', 'dangers', 'ultimate', 'thrill', 'seeking', 'behavior', 'getting', 'dopamine', 'surge', 'brain', 'end', 'movie', 'Sgt', 'James', 'accused', 'being', 'adrenaline', 'junkie', 'know', 'now', 'neurochemical', 'work', 'here', 'dopamine', 'Bomb', 'disposal', 'not', 'just', 'job', 'passion', 'addiction', 'reason', 'being', 'Army.Renner', 'character', 'up', 'cross', 'Elmer', 'Fudd', 'perpetually', 'placid', 'slightly', 'befuddled', 'gaze', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'wile', 'lust', 'excitement', 'danger.His', 'two', 'partners', 'unit', 'Sgt', 'Sanborn', 'Specialist', 'Eldridge', 'who', 'have', 'cover', 'just', 'want', 'survive', 'tour', 'duty', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'how', 'deal', 'determination', 'confront', 'danger', 'One', 'wonders', 'why', 'Sgt', 'James', 'danger', 'why', 'extra', 'risks', 'defuse', 'bomb', 'when', 'detonating', 'would', 'do', 'scene', 'when', 'Sgt', 'James', 'home', 'America', 'one', 'day', 'see', 'doing', 'mundane', 'chores', 'life', 'civilian', 'cleaning', 'out', 'rain', 'gutters', 'cleaning', 'up', 'kitchen', 'shopping', 'wife', 'baby', 'grocery', 'store', 'entire', 'wall', 'full', 'colorful', 'cereal', 'boxes', 'stacked', 'grocery', 'store', 'aisle', 'look', 'utter', 'blankness', 'boredom', 'despair', 'fills', 'face', '..nope', 'not', 'dull', 'life', 'civilian', '.The', 'movie', 'storyline', 'series', 'daily', 'missions', 'almost', 'documentary', 'TV', 'series', 'episode', 'standing', 'alone', 'yet', 'building', 'previous', 'episodes', 'one', 'presenting', 'new', 'danger', 'new', 'challenge', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'war', 'Iraq.What', 'movie', 'work', 'recreation', 'Iraq', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'Jordan', 'local', 'Iraqi', 'expatriates', 'feel', 'oppressive', 'tension', 'whole', 'country', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'where', 'next', 'bomb', 'bullet', 'going', 'come', 'feel', 'fear', 'uncertainty', 'American', 'soldiers', 'caught', 'desire', 'be', 'good', 'guys', 'wanting', 'make', 'nice', 'local', 'Iraqis', 'constantly', 'needing', 'remain', 'vigilant', 'suspicious', 'never', 'knowing', 'who', 'good', 'Iraqi', 'who', 'get', 'shot', 'feel', 'bewilderment', 'resentment', 'local', 'Iraqis', 'who', 'get', 'pushed', 'turn', 'American', 'soldiers.Unlike', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'recent', 'Iraq', 'war', 'movies', 'movie', 'political', 'statements', 'right', 'wrong', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'men', 'work', 'doing', 'dangerous', 'dirty', 'job', 'guys', 'are', 'darn', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'country', 'reasons', 'are', 'are', 'doing']",N/A

This movie shows that a war can very well be both. It follows an Army unit responsible for disposing of explosives, either by disarming or deliberating exploding them. It follows the three men both on the job and off, providing a window on their characters. Far from your typical war movie, the story is basically about the characters with the war as the backdrop.During 2004 in Baghdad, Sergeant William James joins Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge in Bravo Company, who have over 30 days left in their rotation. He's replacing the previous team leader who died trying to ""safely"" detonate an explosive device found in the streets. Such is the daily routine in Iraq where explosives are found hidden in anything from a car to a dead body. Eldridge suffers from feelings of guilt, believing his inaction lead to their leader's death. Sanborn and Eldridge soon both become wary of their new leader when James recklessly goes by himself to manually disarm a bomb when they would typically use a robot first. Is James crazy and will he get them all killed?Bombs aren't the only danger the unit encounters. Driving in their Humvee, they stop when they find a group of unknowns who turn out to be friendlies. It isn't long before they're under fire from enemies hiding out near the sand dunes. Beyond the edge-of-your-seat intensity and violence, there's also a strong emotional component to the movie. James becomes friendly with a young boy selling DVDs on the street and soon discovers the consequences of making friends in a war zone. When an innocent man approaches Army soldiers to ask for help with explosives which have been strapped to his body, James can't do much more than say he's sorry. Despite the atrocities he witnesses on a daily basis, James somehow finds himself drawn to the war. As quoted at the start of the movie, ""war is a drug"".This movie is so realistic in its depiction of war that it almost feels like a documentary; however, it is far from being dry like some real war documentaries can be. It makes you feel for the soldiers who risk their lives every day, never knowing when or from where the next explosion will come. Although none of the actors truly stand out, it's a great ensemble cast. The writing and direction are first rate and truly make you feel you're in a war zone where anything and anyone around you could be dangerous.

If you know absolutely nothing about combat or technique and operating procedures (or common sense) this movie would appear to be realistic. As a work of fiction and with a fast pace and a total disregard for reality this is a very entertaining movie. To believe this is a real depiction of war is a joke. To believe the director, writer or any of the actors have really been in any kind of war is ridiculous. This film tries to be gritty and realistic but it just doesn't work. The direction and filming give it a gritty feel but he plot and actions of the main characters destroy the effect. I agree with a previous reviewer who said that the director could not have spent more than a week in Iraq. The whole concept of the movie is too unrealistic to be taken seriously.

Perhaps the kooks in La-La Land perceive it as anti-war even though the film was gratefully free of political rhetoric.  I note that another review here by an alleged former leader of a bomb disposal team showers praise on this film.  I cannot argue with his expertise on the subject - if he genuinely is experienced in this aspect of warfare - but I do know that the film did little to affect me except to trouble me that this might depict the real behavior of soldiers in the field.  My son, a PFC in the Army Reserves, agrees with me.  Some of the scenes were gripping, and the frustration that the proliferation of IUDs in the Middle East brings - to the extent this movie depicts it accurately - was brought to light well.  Jeremy Renner did a fine acting job, but I hated his character when he should have engendered sympathy.  I wanted to relieve him of duty, send him to the brig, and put a sane person in his place.  His interaction with the Iraqi boy never played out fully, and I could see no reason why the soldier became so involved when he was otherwise so loony.  The scene where the Iraqi couple drove him away made no sense, and the birth of his own son seemed tossed in at the last moment.  Something tells me that much of this film fell to the cutting room floor to adhere to the two-hour rule and left serious gaps.Sorry.

Decent direction, decent camera work, decent special effects.  Some things coulda been better regarding the production but overall, a pretty well-made action film commenting on the combination of stress and enjoyment (yes, enjoyment) which many men get while performing their duties in war.  Jeremy Renner and Brian Geraghty are pretty solid.If you are in the military and have Iraq experience, be advised there are a number of errors, from the outfitting of HUMVEEs to PPE to uniform wear to the blatant GO violations which are almost rampant.  Units seemingly moving willy-nilly on the battlefield without support or apparently even in radio contact with anyone.  A war crime which simply occurs and no one comments on.

Then the confusing night scene which culminates in the wounding of Eldridge by Will hurts the momentum of the movie.The helpless innocent man with the bombs padlocked to his body is pathetic, as is the sight of Will in the cereal aisle of the grocery store, but the power of the movie ended with the sniper scene in the desert with Ralph Fiennes. If Bigelow had removed those later scenes and replaced them with something better, more to the point, the whole movie would have been excellent.The absurdity of war, the civilian population looking on either indifferently or with concealed lethal intentions, is well done. In one scene there is an Iraqi with a camcorder hoping to get footage of the Americans being blown up.The character of Will is haunting, the war addict, who is unfit for civilian life and can only go from war to war, defusing bombs until something or someone kills him.The reappearance of Beckham, who was not after all the dead boy with the body bomb, is a fine irony.

Suspense, however, there is. Edge of your seat suspense, created not only by the plot, this is about defusing bombs before they blow everyone up, but also by the cinematography.  Feet walking forward, first one booted foot, then another. Will the next step cause a hidden bomb to detonate?  We do see detonations, and they are awesome.  What is different about this war movie, set in Iraq, is it's not about seeing how many people our troops can  kill, but how many lives the bomb squad can save, even the lives of the ""enemies,"" who are not soldiers.  The movie echoes the weird situation in Iraq.  We are ""fighting"" an enemy without an army, and no reasons are given for our being there in the first place. The Iraqis we see are shepherds and peddlers and hustlers just trying to get by.The movie opens with the statement that ""War is a drug"" you get addicted to.  The protagonist is addicted to it, both to the danger of defusing bombs, and to being able to save lives.  When his tour is over, this self-assured young man is seen bewildered in the cereal aisle of a market in the US.  This is not his life.  Defusing bombs is.The cinematography is excellent, showing the washed out vistas of the desert and the shimmering of the heat.  The forward tracking shots heighten the suspense.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[3, 5]","This is an independent film, and as such it has a unique flavor to it that you're not bound to find in anything coming out of mainstream Hollywood.  To me, that's a good thing!  The story is about one of the most unconventional of soldiers:  the EOD expert (better known in the civilian world as the ""bomb squad guy"").The movie has more of a feel of a documentary than it does a movie that has a linear plot.  The main character is an amazingly competent diffuser of bombs, but is also a person who lacks common sense and social skills.  He is so adept at deactivating bombs, and yet he is clueless about relations with his girlfriend, and something as banal as shopping for cereal @ the grocery store makes him very uncomfortable.Some may be surprised that this doesn't come off as an anti-war movie like, say,Platoon (Special Edition).  The veracity of the this film has been criticized by people who are far more qualified to challenge its realism than I am.  That said, I would STILL say that the movie brings the viewer closer to what it feels like to be a soldier in a combat zone than most films.As inGood Morning, Vietnam (Special Edition), the main character befriends a young boy who is a native of the foreign country.  Some have said this is unrealistic.  I would disagree.  No matter whether the soldiers are EOD specialists, Rangers, Delta Force or whatever, there's a good chance they have strong parental insticts.

1252576,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B00275EGWY,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[1, 2]","""The Hurt Locker,"" brilliantly directed by Kathryn Bigelow from a script by Mark Boal, is set in 2004 during the Iraq War. Baghdad is a tense place for the American soldiers whose mission it is to identify and defeat the insurgents.  Their task is made even more difficult by the fact that anyone could be a potential suicide bomber; any car could be wired to blow up without warning; and IED's (improvised explosive devices) are cleverly hidden.  Staff Sergeant William James, played by Jeremy Renner, is a swaggering, chain-smoking bomb tech who takes insane risks as the team leader of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit in the U.S. Army's Bravo Company.  His disapproving fellow soldiers are Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), who prefers following protocol to improvising, and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), a young man who fears that each day will be his last.  Sanborn and Eldridge worry that Sergeant James, who is unbelievably arrogant and reckless, will get them all killed.Bigelow effectively used hand-held cameras to give her film the look and feel of a documentary.  We hold our breaths as the soldiers embark on one dangerous operation after another.  Each time the men approach a possible bomb site, they must be on the lookout for booby-traps and snipers.  Sanborn and Eldridge provide cover for James, who attempts to defuse the device without blowing up the entire neighborhood.  Needless to say, this is not a job for the faint of heart.The performances are uniformly excellent.  Renner is superb as a man who enjoys taking apart complicated bombs; he even saves pieces of them as souvenirs.  James briefly shows his human side when he chats about his family back home and befriends a garrulous and brash Iraqi boy. While on duty, however, he is possessed, sometimes stripping off his protective gear so that he can perform his hazardous undertaking more comfortably. Sanborn is a cool customer who gradually succumbs to the stress of living on the edge.  Eldridge is in over his head; he cannot believe that he is stuck in this filthy, stifling, and inhospitable place, fighting a war that cannot be won.This is a terrifying, disturbing, and intensely moving film, in which Bigelow puts the viewer on the mean streets of Baghdad, where the difference between friend and foe is not always clear.  We feel sorry for both the American soldiers and the innocent Iraqi civilians who are caught in the crossfire.  The movie is slightly marred by an unfortunate scene towards the end in which two characters engage in conversation that is so preachy and heavy-handed that it stands out because of its lack of subtlety.  Still, ""The Hurt Locker"" is a timely and provocative film that challenges us to consider the huge toll that war takes, both emotionally and physically, on the brave men and women who serve their country so unselfishly.",5,"""You are in the kill zone.""",1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,2869,"['Hurt', 'Locker', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'script', 'Mark', 'Boal', 'set', '2004', 'Iraq', 'War', 'Baghdad', 'tense', 'place', 'American', 'soldiers', 'mission', 'identify', 'defeat', 'insurgents', 'task', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'fact', 'anyone', 'could', 'be', 'potential', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'car', 'could', 'be', 'wired', 'blow', 'up', 'warning', 'IED', 'improvised', 'explosive', 'devices', 'are', 'cleverly', 'hidden', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'William', 'James', 'played', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'swaggering', 'chain-smoking', 'bomb', 'tech', 'who', 'insane', 'risks', 'team', 'leader', 'Explosive', 'Ordnance', 'Disposal', 'Unit', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Bravo', 'Company', 'disapproving', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'are', 'Sergeant', 'JT', 'Sanborn', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'who', 'following', 'protocol', 'improvising', 'Specialist', 'Owen', 'Eldridge', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'day', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'Sanborn', 'Eldridge', 'worry', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'who', 'unbelievably', 'arrogant', 'reckless', 'will', 'get', 'killed.Bigelow', 'effectively', 'used', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'give', 'film', 'look', 'feel', 'documentary', 'hold', 'breaths', 'soldiers', 'embark', 'one', 'dangerous', 'operation', 'time', 'men', 'approach', 'possible', 'bomb', 'site', 'must', 'be', 'lookout', 'booby-traps', 'snipers', 'Sanborn', 'Eldridge', 'provide', 'cover', 'James', 'who', 'defuse', 'device', 'blowing', 'up', 'entire', 'neighborhood', 'Needless', 'say', 'not', 'job', 'faint', 'heart.The', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Renner', 'superb', 'man', 'who', 'taking', 'apart', 'complicated', 'bombs', 'even', 'pieces', 'souvenirs', 'James', 'briefly', 'human', 'side', 'when', 'family', 'back', 'home', 'garrulous', 'brash', 'Iraqi', 'boy', 'duty', 'however', 'possessed', 'sometimes', 'stripping', 'off', 'protective', 'gear', 'so', 'can', 'perform', 'hazardous', 'undertaking', 'more', 'comfortably', 'Sanborn', 'cool', 'customer', 'who', 'gradually', 'stress', 'living', 'edge', 'Eldridge', 'head', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'stuck', 'filthy', 'stifling', 'inhospitable', 'place', 'fighting', 'war', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'won.This', 'terrifying', 'disturbing', 'intensely', 'moving', 'film', 'Bigelow', 'viewer', 'mean', 'streets', 'Baghdad', 'where', 'difference', 'friend', 'foe', 'not', 'always', 'clear', 'feel', 'sorry', 'American', 'soldiers', 'innocent', 'Iraqi', 'civilians', 'who', 'are', 'caught', 'crossfire', 'movie', 'slightly', 'marred', 'unfortunate', 'scene', 'end', 'two', 'characters', 'engage', 'conversation', 'so', 'preachy', 'heavy-handed', 'out', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'Still', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'timely', 'provocative', 'film', 'consider', 'huge', 'toll', 'war', 'emotionally', 'physically', 'brave', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'serve', 'country', 'so', 'unselfishly']",N/A
1252577,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00275EGWY,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 2]","Director Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) has an uncanny ability to capture the adrenaline in an unbearably tense situation, and she displays this unique skill throughout this propulsive 2009 battlefield drama. In fact, Mark Boal's blunt, economic screenplay (based on his own experiences embedded in a bomb squad) largely eschews the politics around the Iraqi conflict in favor of the escalating madness infiltrating an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit. Their unenviable job is to dispose of undetonated bombs in the war-torn streets of Baghdad during the post-invasion period in 2004. The story's focus is on the new team leader, Sergeant First Class William James, who depends on the support of Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge who are assigned to communicate with James via a radio inside his bomb-suit and provide him with rifle cover while he examines improvised explosive devices (IEDs).Sanborn and Eldridge are still reeling from the sudden death of their previous leader, Staff Sergeant Thompson, when the far more reckless James upsets their established procedures with his extraordinary resolve. James turns out to be a more complex figure than his original bravado indicates, and Sanborn and Eldridge respond by questioning their own perspective on risk versus responsibility. A key factor in understanding James' psyche is his relationship with a local boy who calls himself Beckham because of his love of soccer. This leads James to acts that endanger his team and stretch them beyond wartime bravery and into James' obsessive mission. With visual flair and kinetic editing, Bigelow seems far less concerned with sustaining a narrative, although in this case, her own singular sense of filmmaking bravado overshadows the more conventional plot directions she introduces later in the story. Jeremy Renner is a terrific find as James because he manages to deepen the character's cocksure attitude with every traumatizing episode and without the need for sentiment.That's because he conveys both the uncompromising concentration and the resulting adrenaline rush James feels within the desperation of a free-for-all combat zone. Illustrating their characters' inner conflict in different ways, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty play Eldridge and Sanborn skillfully. Mackie accurately shows Eldridge struggling to be the professional soldier, while Geraghty reflects a more humanistic perspective, the one to which we civilian viewers can probably most relate, and he is especially affecting in his climactic confessional scene. Guy Pearce, David Morse, and Ralph Fiennes show up for brief but surprisingly effective cameos. Barry Ackroyd (United 93) is responsible for the vivid, burnished cinematography. The extras on the 2010 DVD are sparse but quite good. The most informative feature is the commentary track from Bigelow and Boal, who both discuss production details and historical context to allow for a greater appreciation of the story being told. There is also a twelve-minute making-of featurette, which is pretty standard as these extras go. Lastly, an image gallery accompanies a 23-minute Q&A; session with Boal and Bigelow recorded at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London.",5,Bigelow Viscerally Captures the Intense Effects of Wartime Anguish and Ambiguity,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,3225,"['Director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'Point', 'Break', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'capture', 'adrenaline', 'unbearably', 'tense', 'situation', 'unique', 'skill', 'propulsive', '2009', 'battlefield', 'drama', 'fact', 'Mark', 'Boal', 'blunt', 'economic', 'screenplay', 'based', 'own', 'experiences', 'embedded', 'bomb', 'squad', 'largely', 'politics', 'Iraqi', 'conflict', 'favor', 'escalating', 'madness', 'infiltrating', 'Explosive', 'Ordnance', 'Disposal', 'EOD', 'unit', 'unenviable', 'job', 'dispose', 'undetonated', 'bombs', 'war-torn', 'streets', 'Baghdad', 'post-invasion', 'period', '2004', 'story', 'focus', 'new', 'team', 'leader', 'Sergeant', 'First', 'Class', 'William', 'James', 'who', 'support', 'Sergeant', 'J.T', 'Sanborn', 'Specialist', 'Owen', 'Eldridge', 'who', 'are', 'assigned', 'communicate', 'James', 'radio', 'bomb-suit', 'provide', 'rifle', 'cover', 'improvised', 'explosive', 'devices', 'IEDs', '.Sanborn', 'Eldridge', 'are', 'still', 'reeling', 'sudden', 'death', 'previous', 'leader', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Thompson', 'when', 'far', 'more', 'reckless', 'James', 'established', 'procedures', 'extraordinary', 'resolve', 'James', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'complex', 'figure', 'original', 'bravado', 'Sanborn', 'Eldridge', 'respond', 'questioning', 'own', 'perspective', 'risk', 'versus', 'responsibility', 'key', 'factor', 'understanding', 'James', 'psyche', 'relationship', 'local', 'boy', 'who', 'Beckham', 'love', 'soccer', 'James', 'acts', 'endanger', 'team', 'stretch', 'wartime', 'bravery', 'James', 'obsessive', 'mission', 'visual', 'flair', 'kinetic', 'editing', 'Bigelow', 'far', 'less', 'concerned', 'sustaining', 'narrative', 'case', 'own', 'singular', 'sense', 'filmmaking', 'bravado', 'more', 'conventional', 'plot', 'directions', 'later', 'story', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'terrific', 'find', 'James', 'deepen', 'character', 'cocksure', 'attitude', 'traumatizing', 'episode', 'need', 'sentiment.That', 'uncompromising', 'concentration', 'resulting', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'James', 'feels', 'desperation', 'free-for-all', 'combat', 'zone', 'Illustrating', 'characters', 'inner', 'conflict', 'different', 'ways', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'play', 'Eldridge', 'Sanborn', 'skillfully', 'Mackie', 'accurately', 'Eldridge', 'struggling', 'be', 'professional', 'soldier', 'Geraghty', 'more', 'humanistic', 'perspective', 'one', 'civilian', 'viewers', 'can', 'probably', 'most', 'relate', 'especially', 'affecting', 'climactic', 'confessional', 'scene', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'David', 'Morse', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'show', 'up', 'brief', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'cameos', 'Barry', 'Ackroyd', 'United', '93', 'responsible', 'vivid', 'burnished', 'cinematography', 'extras', '2010', 'DVD', 'are', 'sparse', 'quite', 'good', 'most', 'informative', 'feature', 'commentary', 'track', 'Bigelow', 'Boal', 'who', 'discuss', 'production', 'details', 'historical', 'context', 'allow', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'also', 'twelve-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'pretty', 'standard', 'extras', 'go', 'Lastly', 'image', 'gallery', '23-minute', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'Boal', 'Bigelow', 'recorded', 'Institute', 'Contemporary', 'Art', 'London']",N/A

1252579,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B00275EGWY,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[3, 4]","When I pushed PLAY, I expected to be as spellbound as others who had seen this movie and reported the drama here on Amazon. With such high expectations, the only way to go is usually south, and that's what it did.The acting of Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie make them first-class Thespians. They play the part of non-commissioned officers who are in the Army's Explosive Ordnance Disposal, or EOD. It is evident that SSG James finds the adrenaline rush of outsmarting bomb makers and defusing their work. He tempts fate like the matador who moves ever closer to the horns of the bull. He removes his helmet and other life-saving equipment meant to protect him in case of a bomb blast. It looks like he is about to lose his sanity when we are exposed to a scene revealing his humanity, which I will not expound upon. It would be giving away too much of the story.The most effective part of the movie is his return to family life and the mundane chores expected of a husband and family man. There is no excitement in removing the leaves that are blocking the drainage trough at the roof. As an EOD expert, he had to make split-second decisions that could have cost him his life or that of his comrades, yet he looks utterly confounded by the cereals in the aisle when his wife asks him to get one. This is one thing that is not talked about when it comes to veterans returning home. Many will have experienced awesome levels of responsibility for men and materiel that cannot be duplicated in civilian life, and it can be a sudden and tremendous letdown for the ego.  How SSG James deals with this dilemma becomes obvious by the end of the film.If a film spends so much time trying to get into the heads of soldiers under the constant strain of combat, the rest of the surroundings should be equally realistic. This was sloppily addressed with the wrong uniforms, insignia, improper military courtesy, and lack of vehicle markings.  Leaving their posts to chase insurgents with flashlights was appallingly stupid. But what I wondered most about was this ""autonomous team.""

1252582,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B00275EGWY,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","A lot of the reviews of this movie focus on whether it's true to life. I frankly comment, although some of their comments seem pretty picky and trivial (e.g., that the soldiers in this movie don't say ""hooha"" enough). I'll leave the accuracy questions to the experts. Here, I'll focus on a few issues I had with The Hurt Locker as a MOVIE - which is what it is after all (I mean, does anybody think Apocalypse Now was historically accurate?).THE GOODThe movie really does build tension in a few key moments. Ironically, by not building any of the characters into the ""star"" or ""point of view"" character, there's a lot more suspense. We don't know if the guy attempting to defuse the bombs will succeed. The movie leverages this to great effect in some places.Just as important, the movie doesn't undermine the tension with a suffocating soundtrack. There actually isn't much of a soundtrack, so the silence really allows the tension to build. The lack of a suffocating soundtrack also reinforces every gust of wind and every click of the ammo cartridge.Along these lines, the movie does a great job emphasizing smaller moments. It certainly isn't just one gunfight after another, constant gunfire. Rather, there are moments when the most important thing is to clean the ammunition before it can be used. Each IED is treated as a very real and serious threat worthy of the film's attention.THE BADExcept for the character several reviewers have called the maverick EOD, none of the characters stand out. All of the soldiers come across as relatively uninteresting, almost cookie-cutter stereotypes of a ""grunt"". The EOD perhaps goes to the other extreme of the maverick soldier who takes too many risks, but at least his character was more compelling to follow. He showed a genuine range of emotion and had a far more interesting relationship with the other troops. He has a multidimensional personality full of quirks. I found myself caring about him, but ignoring the rest of the troops.I'm not a fan of the pseudo-documentary style of filming. It looks like it was filmed in 48 frames per second. But the movie isn't a documentary and the style just distracts at some points.Overall, 3.5 stars. It's probably the only noteworthy movie about the Iraq War thus far and worth watching for that alone.",4,"some drama, but pseudo-documentary style doesn't work",1352419200,"11 9, 2012",2012,2299,"['lot', 'reviews', 'movie', 'focus', 'true', 'life', 'frankly', 'comment', 'comments', 'seem', 'pretty', 'picky', 'trivial', 'e.g.', 'soldiers', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'hooha', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'accuracy', 'questions', 'experts', 'Here', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'few', 'issues', 'had', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'MOVIE', 'what', 'mean', 'anybody', 'think', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'was', 'historically', 'accurate', 'GOODThe', 'movie', 'really', 'build', 'tension', 'few', 'key', 'moments', 'Ironically', 'not', 'building', 'characters', 'star', 'point', 'view', 'character', 'lot', 'more', 'suspense', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'guy', 'attempting', 'defuse', 'bombs', 'will', 'succeed', 'movie', 'great', 'effect', 'places.Just', 'important', 'movie', ""n't"", 'undermine', 'tension', 'suffocating', 'soundtrack', 'actually', ""n't"", 'much', 'soundtrack', 'silence', 'really', 'tension', 'build', 'lack', 'suffocating', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'gust', 'wind', 'click', 'ammo', 'cartridge.Along', 'lines', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'emphasizing', 'smaller', 'moments', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'just', 'one', 'gunfight', 'constant', 'gunfire', 'Rather', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'clean', 'ammunition', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'IED', 'treated', 'very', 'real', 'serious', 'threat', 'worthy', 'film', 'attention.THE', 'BADExcept', 'character', 'several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'called', 'maverick', 'EOD', 'none', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'soldiers', 'come', 'relatively', 'uninteresting', 'almost', 'cookie-cutter', 'stereotypes', 'grunt', 'EOD', 'perhaps', 'other', 'extreme', 'maverick', 'soldier', 'who', 'too', 'many', 'risks', 'least', 'character', 'was', 'more', 'compelling', 'follow', 'showed', 'genuine', 'range', 'emotion', 'had', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'relationship', 'other', 'troops', 'multidimensional', 'personality', 'full', 'quirks', 'found', 'caring', 'ignoring', 'rest', 'troops.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'pseudo-documentary', 'style', 'filming', 'was', 'filmed', '48', 'frames', 'second', 'movie', ""n't"", 'documentary', 'style', 'just', 'distracts', 'points.Overall', '3.5', 'stars', 'probably', 'only', 'noteworthy', 'movie', 'Iraq', 'War', 'thus', 'far', 'worth', 'watching', 'alone']",N/A

With that said, there are some GROSS inaccuracies.

You will however see the Infantry pulling security in the most blatant show of force possible, along with Armour. Not to slam EOD, as they are pretty damned couragious, they are a support element, not a front line combat soldier. To depict them as some sort of skin of their teeth rambo organization is pure fantasy.As for the sniper scene. Very well done from the actual sniper perspective, however there isn't a chance in all that is holy that an EOD guy would be able to pick up the rifle and get down to work. Just because you are sitting behind the rifle doesn't mean you're going to hit anything. There is a reason sniper school is one of the most difficult schools in the military.

Kathryn Bigelow, director/producerThe Hurt Locker (2008) is one of the best movies from last year and for me, it is the most deserving nominee  for  Best Picture of the year of five that I have seen so far. The director, Kathryn Bigelow who is known for making the dazzling, dynamic, intelligent and intense action movies, feels at home in the very manly world of directing war film. The Hurt Locker that has been universally praised by the critics and the audiences since it premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2008 may make a history if Bigelow wins the Best Directing Oscar coming March 7th but even if it won't happen, The Hurt Locker has already found its place in history as the remarkable and to the date the best film of the war in Iraq.  It does not explore why we are there and who is responsible for the war. It just places us ""inside"", along with three main characters, the members of a bomb squad as they go about their daily business, doing their most dangerous and unforgiving job in the world, trying to survive the last 39 days of their rotation. The effect of the total immersion was achieved by Bigelow and Barry Ackroyd, the cinematographer (United 93) by using multiple S16mm cameras to capture multiple perspectives.The Hurt Locker is based on accounts of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad in the war in Iraq where he would go with the members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks very closely. Based on his experiences, his screen play is the fictional retelling of the  real events.  He said of the film's goal that the creators wanted to show the experiences of the soldiers that we'd never see on the daily news. I believe that director and screenwriter, as well as everyone involved in the making of The Hurt Locker have achieved their goals. The result is an unforgettable filmIt is remarkable that the film's more famous actors (Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and David Morse) only show up for a short cameo leaving Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty to carry movie on their own.  All three do an amazing job. Jeremy Renner, relatively un-known becomes a real center of the film and turns a star making performance.  With the face far from a typical cinema hero, he becomes a true hero of the film, the guy who by the words of his younger comrade is not good with people but a great warrior, confident, cool, good at his deadly job, always having it done. It is about him, the epigraph to the film says, war is drug for he is addicted to the rush that only combat can give him.I found the film absolutely riveting, gripping, and intense. It is amazingly shot, the  pace is perfect, and the action scenes executed masterfully. It also works as the characters study of the men at war and how the war affects them.",5,"""War's dirty little secret is that some men love it...",1265673600,"02 9, 2010",2010,2912,"[""'m"", 'trying', 'unpack', 'why', 'look', 'what', 'be', 'hero', 'context', '21st-century', 'combat', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'director/producerThe', 'Hurt', 'Locker', '2008', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'last', 'year', 'most', 'deserving', 'nominee', 'Best', 'Picture', 'year', 'five', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'who', 'known', 'making', 'dazzling', 'dynamic', 'intelligent', 'intense', 'action', 'movies', 'feels', 'home', 'very', 'manly', 'world', 'directing', 'war', 'film', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'been', 'universally', 'praised', 'critics', 'audiences', 'premiered', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', '2008', 'may', 'make', 'history', 'Bigelow', 'Best', 'Directing', 'Oscar', 'coming', 'March', '7th', 'even', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'already', 'found', 'place', 'history', 'remarkable', 'date', 'best', 'film', 'war', 'Iraq', 'not', 'explore', 'why', 'are', 'there', 'who', 'responsible', 'war', 'just', 'inside', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'members', 'bomb', 'squad', 'go', 'daily', 'business', 'doing', 'most', 'dangerous', 'unforgiving', 'job', 'world', 'trying', 'survive', 'last', '39', 'days', 'rotation', 'effect', 'total', 'immersion', 'was', 'achieved', 'Bigelow', 'Barry', 'Ackroyd', 'cinematographer', 'United', '93', 'using', 'multiple', 'S16mm', 'cameras', 'capture', 'multiple', 'perspectives.The', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'based', 'accounts', 'Mark', 'Boal', 'freelance', 'journalist', 'who', 'was', 'embedded', 'American', 'bomb', 'squad', 'war', 'Iraq', 'where', 'would', 'go', 'members', '10', '15', 'times', 'day', 'watch', 'tasks', 'very', 'closely', 'Based', 'experiences', 'screen', 'play', 'fictional', 'retelling', 'real', 'events', 'said', 'film', 'goal', 'creators', 'wanted', 'show', 'experiences', 'soldiers', ""'d"", 'never', 'see', 'daily', 'news', 'believe', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'as', 'well', 'everyone', 'involved', 'making', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'have', 'achieved', 'goals', 'result', 'unforgettable', 'filmIt', 'remarkable', 'film', 'more', 'famous', 'actors', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'David', 'Morse', 'only', 'show', 'up', 'short', 'cameo', 'leaving', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'carry', 'movie', 'own', 'three', 'do', 'amazing', 'job', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'relatively', 'un-known', 'becomes', 'real', 'center', 'film', 'star', 'making', 'performance', 'face', 'far', 'typical', 'cinema', 'hero', 'true', 'hero', 'film', 'guy', 'who', 'words', 'younger', 'comrade', 'not', 'good', 'people', 'great', 'warrior', 'confident', 'cool', 'good', 'deadly', 'job', 'always', 'having', 'done', 'epigraph', 'film', 'war', 'drug', 'addicted', 'rush', 'only', 'combat', 'can', 'give', 'him.I', 'found', 'film', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'gripping', 'intense', 'amazingly', 'shot', 'pace', 'perfect', 'action', 'scenes', 'executed', 'masterfully', 'also', 'characters', 'study', 'men', 'war', 'how', 'war']",N/A

Don't take that as a negative, as everyone who was in the movie was a star. Very strange movie. It was more like a ""you-are-there"" documentary of a small part of the war in Iraq and it seemed ultra-realistic. Amazing! I can understand the Academy Awards. It's a wonder it didn't get more! The movie followed a small force in a Humvee whose task was to disarm bombs. Tense? Oh, yeah! In any  case, they were followed on their day to day tasks as they went through their time until they were relieved by a new crew. The movie took place in a little over a month and it was date stamped as you proceeded. It really wasn't much of a story, but at the same time, it was one of the most powerful stories you might ever see. You get out of it what you read into it. In a lot of ways, that's the best kind of story.Okay, let me give a little of my own personal background. I've never been in the military and I've never even been close to combat of any kind. So, how am I to judge a combat film? Well, I'm not judging it. What I'm saying is that this can be a very powerful movie, if you allow it to be. When I got through with the movie, I went to the Amazon Reviews just to see what other people thought of it. I was glad I read the reviews and comments after viewing the movie. Not everyone likes the movie, to say the least. Some think it's awful. Many give it high praise. Well, the reviews, together with their comments, are all over the place, and a lot of them are very thoughtful and well worth reading. This movie has impact! Trust me on that. See for yourself. Whether you like the movie or don't like the movie, it certainly gets things stirred up, more than any movie I've seen in decades.

The Army felt this was too much of an anti-war story. But I guess that depends on your point of view. Showing the horrors of war is not necessarily anti-war. It's just a taste of reality. And in this case, it's a bitter taste.Exploring the activites and emotions of an Army Explosive Ordinance team, The Hurt Locker was filmed in Jordan, not in Iraq. But I don't think anyone besides an Iraq War veteran will know this wasn't filmed in the war zone, with real troops and live ammunition. It feels like the real thing. Not so much documentary style as I had imagined. The actors are wonderful. The writing is crisp and concise. The photography is amazing. And the entire story is completely believable. It's no wonder The Hurt Locker rocked the 2010 BAFTA awards, winning best film, director, original screenplay, editing, cinematography and sound. I have no doubt that the film will also sweep the Oscars.I hate to single anyone out of this superb cast, but I have to say what a pleasure it was to see Guy Pearce in the role of Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson. I've long admired his acting, and wished to see him more often. Jeremy Renner and Ralph Fiennes also turned in predictably solid performances, which I'm sure raised the bar for the less experienced members of the corps.I'm told the budget for this film was only $11 million. Which, when compared to $200 million dollar blockbusters, is an unimaginably small budget. But you will never know, from watching this film, that there was any ill effect from such a thrifty production. It looks and feels like the award winning accomplishment it is. And that only adds to my admiration of director Kathryn Bigelow (James Cameron's ex-wife), and her talented crew. I just can't heap enough praise upon this gem.Whether you view this as pro-Army, or anti-war, or just plain shocking, you have to say this film is thought provoking, deeply emotional, and I feel, honestly presents the bravery, patriotism, and esprit de corps of the men you'll find in our military today.Update 8Mar; Congratulations to Kathryn, and the cast and crew for 9 Oscar nominations, and 6 Oscar awards including BEST PICTURE!",5,Stunning Reality (BEST PICTURE 2010 OSCARS),1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,2272,"['really', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'assistance', 'U.S.', 'Armed', 'Forces', 'did', 'Army', 'felt', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'anti-war', 'story', 'guess', 'point', 'view', 'Showing', 'horrors', 'war', 'not', 'necessarily', 'anti-war', 'just', 'taste', 'reality', 'case', 'bitter', 'taste.Exploring', 'activites', 'emotions', 'Army', 'Explosive', 'Ordinance', 'team', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'was', 'filmed', 'Jordan', 'not', 'Iraq', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'Iraq', 'War', 'veteran', 'will', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'filmed', 'war', 'zone', 'real', 'troops', 'live', 'ammunition', 'real', 'thing', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'documentary', 'style', 'had', 'imagined', 'actors', 'are', 'wonderful', 'writing', 'crisp', 'concise', 'photography', 'amazing', 'entire', 'story', 'completely', 'believable', 'wonder', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'rocked', '2010', 'BAFTA', 'awards', 'winning', 'best', 'film', 'director', 'original', 'screenplay', 'editing', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'have', 'doubt', 'film', 'will', 'also', 'sweep', 'Oscars.I', 'hate', 'single', 'anyone', 'superb', 'cast', 'have', 'say', 'what', 'pleasure', 'was', 'see', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'role', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Matt', 'Thompson', ""'ve"", 'long', 'admired', 'acting', 'wished', 'see', 'more', 'often', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'also', 'turned', 'predictably', 'solid', 'performances', ""'m"", 'sure', 'raised', 'bar', 'less', 'experienced', 'members', 'corps.I', ""'m"", 'told', 'budget', 'film', 'was', 'only', '11', 'million', 'Which', 'when', 'compared', '200', 'million', 'dollar', 'blockbusters', 'unimaginably', 'small', 'budget', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'ill', 'effect', 'thrifty', 'production', 'feels', 'award', 'winning', 'accomplishment', 'only', 'admiration', 'director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'James', 'Cameron', 'ex-wife', 'talented', 'crew', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'heap', 'enough', 'praise', 'gem.Whether', 'view', 'pro-Army', 'anti-war', 'just', 'plain', 'shocking', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'thought', 'provoking', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'feel', 'honestly', 'bravery', 'patriotism', 'esprit', 'de', 'corps', 'men', ""'ll"", 'find', 'military', 'today.Update', '8Mar', 'Congratulations', 'Kathryn', 'cast', 'crew', '9', 'Oscar', 'nominations', '6', 'Oscar', 'awards', 'including', 'BEST', 'PICTURE']",N/A

I had to turn it off after the guy---no body armor, but ACU pants that weren't being issued at the time, which would have gotten him killed----left the base with a gun to a civilian's head.  As it happens, two of the guys in my squad did something like that just prior to us new guys arriving. They went to a party, they carried unauthorized weapons, and for most of the rest of the tour they were on extra duty and restriction. Then the insurgency exploded, and going outside the wire just became a laughable idea.Where do I start, where do I start? The part where the officer stands next to a big huge brand-new looking, definitely FULL burlap sack in the street and nobody notices RIGHT AWAY? Did I mention this guy's EOD? And it's 2004 in Iraq, when everybody learned exactly what IED meant? The one-vehicle excursion out into the desert? The mercenaries, also in one vehicle? Jeez, does Fallujah, April 4th, 2004 ring any bells? Aside from which, leaving base---in one vehicle for the soldiers, if not for the mercs-----was strictly forbidden, simply because it was the best way to get yourself killed. The soldiers knew this, too.  You had to have a convoy, you had to have a certain number of soldiers, certain numbers and types of weapons, and certain procedures. This wasn't drill and ceremony; this was stuff that would keep you alive. And any realistic soldier recognized that a lot of that stuff made sense.And then there's the scene where they get trapped by snipers in a building eight hundred meters away, who can blow away a merc with a tough shot yet can't take out the lead character's buddy once he takes off his helmet. And for that matter, they DON'T take out the guy who's taking them out. If they can see well enough to hit the turret gunner in the jugular then they can take out the dude who just took off his Kevlar.I had to turn it off. I'm going to guess it didn't get much better. The bottom line is, if you have to change the reality of the story that much to tell your story, there's something wrong with the story. That's the writer's fault, and sure it makes their job easy, but that's the job. This kind of laziness reminds me of way Stephen King uses telepathy in all his books because otherwise he'd have to actually explain certain things and write maybe three hundred more pages. You have to wonder why, if they want to write about the military so much, they make it so fake.Some people don't grasp this idea. It's honesty. It's hard work. Artistically, I'd say there's different kinds of honesty. There's every I dotted, every T crossed accuracy.  Then there's emotional honesty,  where you follow the spirit of something rather than the letter of it. This is what movie makers use a lot, yet this movie has neither. If you can't get the details right, the basic facts of military life, then something's wrong with your story.  It's not the military that's the problem; it's the fact that you can't get it right, that the story you want to tell can't be made to fit the framework you've chosen for it. A lot of civilians get the military wrong, thinking it's matter of picking which extreme to place the story at. But they miss all the gray areas in the middle, all the perfectly ordinary people in the military who do extraordinary things, and I think a lot of people flinch from that complexity.  Even today, members of the military are either saints or villains to people, and this movie was an attempt to capitalize on a third role: that of suffering---or angry---survivor. Yet Renner's character was just a smug, arrogant bad boy, more of a Tom Cruise character than anything original.""Black Hawk Down"" which had its flaws, still remains the mark to beat, and this one didn't even come close.",2,The details and the lack of accuracy matter,1304899200,"05 9, 2011",2011,3775,"['admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'had', 'turn', 'off', 'guy', 'body', 'armor', 'ACU', 'pants', 'were', ""n't"", 'being', 'issued', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'killed', 'left', 'base', 'gun', 'civilian', 'head', 'two', 'guys', 'squad', 'did', 'something', 'just', 'prior', 'new', 'guys', 'arriving', 'went', 'party', 'carried', 'unauthorized', 'weapons', 'most', 'rest', 'tour', 'were', 'extra', 'duty', 'restriction', 'Then', 'insurgency', 'exploded', 'going', 'wire', 'just', 'became', 'laughable', 'idea.Where', 'do', 'start', 'where', 'do', 'start', 'part', 'where', 'officer', 'next', 'big', 'huge', 'brand-new', 'looking', 'definitely', 'FULL', 'burlap', 'sack', 'street', 'nobody', 'notices', 'RIGHT', 'AWAY', 'Did', 'mention', 'guy', 'EOD', '2004', 'Iraq', 'when', 'everybody', 'learned', 'exactly', 'what', 'IED', 'meant', 'one-vehicle', 'excursion', 'desert', 'mercenaries', 'also', 'one', 'vehicle', 'Jeez', 'Fallujah', 'April', '4th', '2004', 'ring', 'bells', 'Aside', 'leaving', 'base', 'one', 'vehicle', 'soldiers', 'not', 'mercs', '-was', 'strictly', 'forbidden', 'simply', 'was', 'best', 'way', 'get', 'killed', 'soldiers', 'knew', 'too', 'had', 'have', 'convoy', 'had', 'have', 'certain', 'number', 'soldiers', 'certain', 'numbers', 'types', 'weapons', 'certain', 'procedures', 'was', ""n't"", 'drill', 'ceremony', 'was', 'stuff', 'would', 'keep', 'alive', 'realistic', 'soldier', 'recognized', 'lot', 'stuff', 'made', 'sense.And', 'then', 'scene', 'where', 'get', 'trapped', 'snipers', 'building', 'eight', 'hundred', 'meters', 'away', 'who', 'can', 'blow', 'away', 'merc', 'tough', 'shot', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'out', 'lead', 'character', 'buddy', 'once', 'helmet', 'matter', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'take', 'out', 'guy', 'who', 'taking', 'out', 'can', 'see', 'well', 'enough', 'hit', 'turret', 'gunner', 'jugular', 'then', 'can', 'take', 'out', 'dude', 'who', 'just', 'took', 'off', 'Kevlar.I', 'had', 'turn', 'off', ""'m"", 'going', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'better', 'bottom', 'line', 'have', 'change', 'reality', 'story', 'much', 'tell', 'story', 'something', 'wrong', 'story', 'writer', 'fault', 'sure', 'job', 'easy', 'job', 'kind', 'laziness', 'reminds', 'way', 'Stephen', 'King', 'telepathy', 'books', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'have', 'actually', 'explain', 'certain', 'things', 'write', 'maybe', 'three', 'hundred', 'more', 'pages', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'want', 'write', 'military', 'so', 'much', 'make', 'so', 'fake.Some', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'grasp', 'idea', 'honesty', 'hard', 'work', 'Artistically', ""'d"", 'say', 'different', 'kinds', 'honesty', 'dotted', 'T', 'crossed', 'accuracy', 'Then', 'emotional', 'honesty', 'where', 'follow', 'spirit', 'something', 'rather', 'letter', 'what', 'movie', 'makers', 'use', 'lot', 'yet', 'movie', 'neither', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'details', 'right', 'basic', 'facts', 'military', 'life', 'then', 'something', 'wrong', 'story', 'not', 'military', 'problem', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'story', 'want', 'tell', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'made', 'fit', 'framework', ""'ve"", 'chosen', 'lot', 'civilians', 'get', 'military', 'wrong', 'thinking', 'matter', 'picking', 'extreme', 'place', 'story', 'miss', 'gray', 'areas', 'middle', 'perfectly', 'ordinary', 'people', 'military', 'who', 'do', 'extraordinary', 'things', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'flinch', 'complexity', 'Even', 'today', 'members', 'military', 'are', 'saints', 'villains', 'people', 'movie', 'was', 'attempt', 'capitalize', 'third', 'role', 'suffering', '-or', 'angry', '-survivor', 'Renner', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'smug', 'arrogant', 'bad', 'boy', 'more', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'anything', 'original', 'Black', 'Hawk', 'Down', 'had', 'flaws', 'still', 'mark', 'beat', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close']",N/A

Hard as it is to discount the evidence of your senses when bombarded with skillful and costly cinematography, the 'gritty realism' of this film is totally unrealistic, full-bore Hollywood. Yeah, there may be scenes of mayhem similar to the scenes in the film at times, but not with such convenient regularity, not even in Baghdad in 2004. And there were innumerable other implausible or outright false details; just look at the one-star reviews here and not how many are written by military veterans.So, is ""the Hurt Locker"" an anti-military film? Hmm. It didn't strike me that way. Is it an anti-war film? Well, it doesn't glorify war, that's obvious, but it doesn't precisely get tough and analytical about the futility of war either. We all know , whether first hand or not, that war is dangerous to living things, soldiers or kids or old ladies at market. The Hurt Locker DOES depict the absolute futility of America's military occupation of Iraq, but that analysis seems almost tangential to the core of the film, which is the portrayal of Sgt. James, the genuine ""wild man"" who defuses bombs with his bare hands and whose maverick heroism gets several of his comrades gravely wounded, probably unnecessarily. Are we supposed to admire the maverick, or at least to empathize with him? That has to be what the film is asking of us. But the man is an ACTOR, friends! He's good-looking, witty, and he gets soft-hearted about an Iraqi boy with a big smile. The real Sgt James (who wouldn't be allowed such maverick-space in the real army) would not be so appealing. He's a pathological dude, amigos! He's a runaway train you wouldn't want on your tracks. I'm not sure you'd want him coming home to your community, either, even with combat ribbons. The real Sgt Jameses, and there are a few, bring home more trouble than the whole army protected you from. The psych clinics and emergency rooms of America are familiar with Sgt James and his battered wife.Apparently lots of people were impressed with Jeremy Renner's performance as Sgt James. Me, I thought it was shallow. Anthony Mackie, as the second man on the bomb squad, delivered a more convincing characterization. Can a film this bloody and ugly be bland? It was for me.

In fact there is a scene, reasonably long showing how our main character in Hurt Locker cannot cope with normal life at home. In Apocalypse Now Martin Sheen lies on his back in a sweaty bed and thinks out loud ""When I was home after my first tour, it was worse. I'd wake up and there'd be nothing.

1252610,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00275EGWY,Grady Harp,"[6, 10]","THE HURT LOCKER is not an easy film to watch, especially for veterans.  It may be about the Iraq War circa 2004, but it is essentially about WAR in general and the devastation created by this most foolish of human games not only on the countrymen of the site of the killing but also on the soldiers from all countries who bond to fight the 'enemy': as Pogo said in a long ago war 'We have met the enemy and he is us'.  Kathryn Bigelow has accomplished the unthinkable - she has created a small, tense, breathless re-enactment of a group of men (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) whose sense of mission and sense of family and disillusion are as fragile as the homemade human and other bombs they render safe. In a minimal but terse script by Mark Boal the words are less important than the expressions on the actors faces, and with a cast as fine as this, those statements are more powerful  than words.The scene is Baghdad in 2004 and we watch as an EOD specialist Thompson (Guy Pierce), a man for whom the group - namely Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) - has profound respect and love, is blown up in the first minutes of the film.  Thompson is replaced by an obsessed EOD specialist with a record of over 800 bombs rendered safe, one William James (Jeremy Renner) who keeps his mementos of wasted bombs in his 'hurt locker' under his bed.  The film deals with the gradual adjustment of the men to this new, obsessed EOD man as the group faces horrendous encounters with the Iraqis, both adults and children.  There are surprise cameos by David Morse and by Ralph Fiennes, but they don't last long as characters.  What lasts is the interdependency among the men locked into a mission more terrifying than can be imagined.Jeremy Renner delivers a finely nuanced performance of a man whose adrenaline rush with his job makes him a unique sort of being, yet a man who is capable of the most tender of responses.  Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are also superb in roles that in other actors' hands may have become trite.  This is an important film for all of us to see - especially now, as war escalates over the globe.  Kathryn Bigelow deserves the Oscar for bringing this stunning event to the screen.

The rave reviews and hype suggested it was just propaganda for the war (""Yeah, war is horrible, but...""), but I wanted to see for myself. I was actually quite surprised. Yes, it's got some propaganda elements. The horrors of the war in Iraq are understated in the film. Where's Blackwater? Where is the random murder and rape of civilians and children? Lacuna like these aside, the film is interesting. (Spoiler warning!)The Hurt Locker follows the operations of an elite U.S. army bomb squad as they handle IEDs, car bombs, ""body bombs"", and investigate the scenes of exploded materials. Its fairly realistic look and narrative is probably because it was written and produced by Mark Boal, who spent time embedded with a real bomb squad in Iraq.The script reveals only what the characters see and experience and for those who are paying attention, the absence of any real explanation for the violence throughout the film is telling. Bombs are discovered, but never their creators. Stashes are found, but never their owners. A young boy is found murdered, a bomb sewn into his abdomen. In fact, except for a sole sniper and his companions, the so-called ""enemy"" is never seen, only assumed to be real. This is understandable, given the fact that armed resistance is a given in any occupied territory. In fact, the only villains seen in the film are the occupiers, like the commander who suggestively orders the murder of an Iraqi man with a survivable wound, or the British (SAS?) bounty hunters dressed in Arab clothing whom the main characters encounter in the desert.The noticeable absence of any real ""terrorist network"" is particularly evident in two scenes. In the first, the bomb squad is called to investigate a suicide bombing in the Green Zone. The team Sergeant is the only one to point out that it was probably a remote detonation, not an actual suicide bombing. How many remote bombings, committed by persons unknown, are written off as ""suicide bombings"" without any real investigation? In the second scene, some soldiers encounter a ""suicide bomber"" with a bomb vest. While the majority of the near-hysterical soldiers want to shoot the man on site, it's revealed that he was forced against his will, by parties unknown, to wear the vest and approach the soldiers. He was coerced, again by persons unknown.In fact, while the film doesn't reveal it, the truth is that the vast majority, if not all, of the ""suicide bombings"" in Iraq are orchestrated and engineered by U.S., U.K., and Israeli intelligence to give the illusion of a real enemy, thus justifying an extended occupation and a profitable War Without End against a fabled enemy. The thought patterns concerning the war in Iraq, whether of the soldiers themselves or the American and world public, are built on the false premise that there is an enemy. We naturally ""fill in the blanks"", but only after the key pieces of data have been provided to complete our collective substitution of data. As a result, the absence of a real enemy isn't noticed. It's straight out ofNineteen Eighty Four. (Haven't read it? Do so, and learn a lesson from Emmanuel Goldstein.)For those readers used to being fed on the unwholesome chaff of the mainstream media rags, these statements may come as a shock. Scoffs of disbelief and the occasional outburst of ""Ridiculous!"" accompanied by frantic gesticulations are to be expected. But in a society where entire professions rely on people deliberately manipulating the truth in order to ""win"" an argument, where policing serves politics and quotas, not care and protection of citizens, where military personnel protect ""national interests"" and not national safety, and where people are so used to lying that it is considered normal and perfectly acceptable, is such a reality really so hard to believe?When we consider some facts that, taken separately, are relatively easy to believe, the situation becomes clearer. Psychopaths thrive in corporations and politics (witness Madoff and Blagojevich), and the violent ones are considered the worst of the worst criminals (most serial killers are psychopaths).

1252615,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B00275EGWY,Haunted Flower,"[1, 5]","This is not my favorite movie genre, but I will say it is a well-made movie.The Hurt Locker was directed by Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) and written by Mark Boal. It stars Jeremy Renner as Sgt. William James, a team leader for a bomb squad stationed in Iraq. The other members of his team are Sgt. JT Sanborn played by Anthony Mackie and Spc. Owen Eldridge played by Brian Geraghty. The story takes place over a 39 day period where Bravo company is waiting to be relieved so they can go home.This movie's directing is fantastic. The terrifying suspense that builds over time with each bomb wondering if it will be someone's last bomb to attempt to defuse. The terrain, heat, and dust were so well captured, they were making ME thirsty! Emotionally, the life and death situation these soldiers were put into everyday really messed with their psyche and perception of their mortality. James is a wildman, fearless to just jump into any situation recklessly, Sanborn tries his best to keep everyone safe but is afraid of commitment and getting too close to a woman back home, and Eldridge is getting therapy from a Colonel because he so intensely feels the strain that every day he might die.The actors very clearly defined their characters. All were well developed with layers in their performance, not all bravado or all fear. They just worked amazingly well as a unit. I have a hard time even singling out any of the three because as soon as I attribute something to one in my head, I remember something else one of the others did. Let's just say they handled the heavy burden of this movie incredibly well and I hope to see more from them in the future.One last note, turns out James' wife back home is Evangeline Lilly, Kate from LOST. My husband and James have something in common, if that was what they had to come home to, they'd be bored too, haha. We're not Kate or Jack fans.

Unfortunately, I had to enjoy much of the remainder of the movie with my eyes closed, due to the camerawork. The movie was filmed, documentary-style, with hand-held cameras. You'd be hard-pressed to find a steady outdoor scene in the entire film, that didn't play tug-of-war with your equilibrium. Not the best friend of anyone susceptible to motion sickness, like me.I was so incredibly queasy that I couldn't even get up to leave the theater (like I did during the Blair Witch Project), though I noticed at least 5 or 6 others did. I stayed throughout the entire film, *listening* to a movie I paid $12 to *see*, occasionally sneaking a peak, to see what was going on.I understand the quality of filming this way - it makes the audience feel like they're *there* and it's becoming a common trait in many new movies. But for an action movie,  it's asking a little too much of your motion sensory in my opinion.As for the story, itself:The movie wasn't quite what I was expecting, and that's a good thing. I thought it was just going to be another war movie, but it was so much more. Had a little bit of Jarhead, Platoon and Blown Away tastefully &  intelligently woven into its fabric.

It's focused around the role of  many times forgotten personage in the war, this expert in deactivating deadly, mortal and  sophisticated weapons.Irak, 2004. In the first third of the film we will assist to a sort of documental account. First dealing with the deactivation of two weapons, then the massacre in the desert and finally realizing that nothing can make it to save the life of a n innocent. During the adagio of the film we will watch how these guys spent their free time, and we'll witness how the fraternity of this antihero with a sympathetic child will become an act of personal justice when this boy be murdered by the enemy.The spontaneity of the script is probably its main strength. One can feel that the hazardous and tensional moments are by themselves the dramatic core of the film. Dislike Platoon, for instance, there're not philosophical gestures or the well accustomed dichotomy between the good guys and the bad guys.In Vietnam, you could see your enemy through the eyes of the jungle, but under the inclement heat of the desert, the enemy is invisible. You have not a direct contact with it and so, we have a kind of technological conflagration. You fight against the mortal device not with the enemy, and if case you deal with it the nocturnal sequences demand from you other tactics and procedures.Kathryn Bigelow made an admirable and nervous camera handle, remarking (as Petersen did in Das boot) the anguishing frenzy of being dead or alive in question of seconds where a false movement is just the difference.The film simply doesn't pretend to become a denounce film.

1252623,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B00275EGWY,Irfan A. Alvi,"[20, 27]","The ratings of this movie are surprisingly all over the place, so I read many reviews to try to understand why.  It appears that a major area of contention is whether this movie is sufficiently realistic.  A number of people with military experience, including some with experience in Iraq, argue that the movie is too unrealistic, but their complaints often focus on technicalities which, though not always trivial, perhaps aren't too important for the typical non-military viewer.  And there are also a number of military people who find the movie quite realistic, so it seems that the experiences of military people vary substantially.  Considering all of this, my sense is that the movie reasonably faithfully portrays at least the essence of the experiences of at least some military people, so it's accurate enough for its purpose.If so, I found this movie to be a powerful and riveting depiction of why ""war is hell,"" including ""war"" which is actually occupation.  On the American side, our troops face a situation where they often can't tell friend from foe, they can die very unexpectedly and suddenly, and they're constant witness to destruction and death, including the death of people who become their friends.  On the Iraqi side, they have the natural resentment, bitterness, and defiance of people who are being occupied by a foreign power.  Never before have I had a such a clear sense of why war must be avoided unless there's truly no other reasonable option.This leads to the issue of whether the movie has a political message.  Many reviewers have argued that it doesn't overtly have such a message, and I agree. But, at the same time, by depicting how pointless and detrimental the occupation of Iraq is, with suffering on all sides, the movie does help to clarify why we never should have gone into Iraq in the first place, and why we need to get out ASAP.  Let's remember that inspectors had already failed to find any WMDs after extensive searching, there was never any credible link between Iraq and 9/11, and there was never any credible evidence or argument showing that Iraq posed a genuine threat to the US.  By going in there, all we've done is destabilize Iraq and open the floodgates of civil war, cause a huge loss of life on all sides, expend many billions of dollars (which we obviously can't afford), and make America LESS safe.  The only parties which seem to have benefitted are the defense contractors who have made tons of money at the expense of the American public (you and me).  If we really want to ""support our troops,"" we need to get them out of harms way and bring them home to their families, rather than asking them to endure enormous hardships and risk their lives for a conflict which makes no sense.Anyway, getting back to the movie, my point is that the movie vividly illustrates the basis for my comments.

The opening shot with it's low angle close-up sets the tone for the rest of the movie, she's going to show you a range of emotions mixed with the stark backdrop of war torn Iraq. I can't give this film all five stars because several times in the movie the director allows the on-screen action to overpower the dialog. Overall it's a good drama with a legitimate plot. Bigelow is a talented director and the actors do fairly good job of conveying the rush of emotions of combat in a foreign land. Everybody wants to go home except the lead character Will, played by Jeremy Renner. Renner's character seems to be addicted to the excitement. Although Will is skillful he is seen as reckless by Sgt. Sanborn, played by Anthony Mackie. A great deal of the movie addresses the tension between these two characters.

1252625,A26YFGY8BDEN2U,B00275EGWY,Jack Young,"[0, 4]","INTRONICE. Nothing about vague words like Honor or Patriotism. The men were there to do a job save lives, and they tried to do it well and go home. It nicely captured the stress from the prolonged exposure to danger and deployment! What I like though is that there was no mentioned of either the word ""Stress"" or ""Duty"", unlike other war movies. But as a package, the subtle signs are there for all to see.I found the lead review by DarthRad, titled ""Taut war drama exploring the psychology of soldiering"" by fairly relevant. Hence I will only share certain aspects that I think was not answered in that review.Q&A;Why did Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner) prefer combat than family?Probably to the man, its either you dismantle the bomb or you don't. No grey areas, unlike when it comes to family and love. He did not communicate well with the wife, though he loved her and the baby. (He tried calling her from Iraq, but don't know what to say).Why did Sergeant James choose bomb dismantling?Probably it gave some adrenaline. It's a job that others shun (its one of the most dangerous job) and one that he can Excel. As I have said, the show doesn't keep talking about duty (we can safely assumed its not sponsored by the Neo-Con). But there he was, performing his duty to his country, and bringing bread to his family the best way he knows how (though agreed that it's a dangerous way).Why did Sergeant James put himself in extra risks when detonating it would do?He understood that winning the war, is not only about bombing/killing the Iraqis. Its to show them why the US Army was better. On the IEDs, he saw that the perception of winning convincingly (in the eyes of Iraqis), is to beat them at their own games.Its well-known that US Army got one of the best technology. Thefore, he was trying to show that US Army have the wits and balls to overcome the sneaky matters that the terrorists were using with the Iraqis. You can call him dumb in choosing this way to signal to the Iraqis. But that is what we call firm conviction and delication.Why did Sgt. Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge (partners of Sergeant James), stood by Sergeant James dangerous antics?They were conservative to risks, but they still protected and followed Sergeant James. This was because, they too shared Sergeant James's belief that they were there to make a difference. Like James, they too knew that firefighting daily to dismantle the bombs would not stop the bombs from coming. Its through their actions that would turn the tide of Iraqis opinions and stop the IEDs from coming.There was also an aspect of dedication to their fellow soldiers. That partly explained why they always covered James even though they do not fully agreed with him.The needs to get to the cause of IEDs and their dedication to their fellow soldiers cumulated when James led them to chase after the ""phantom bombers"" when there was an big explosion at the Greenzone, where they are called to investigate.The fact that they may not have made sound and reasonable judgment did not mean that they are of unsounded mind. It just showed that with prolonged combat fatigue, daily tensions and fog of wars, different decisions may be chosen despite the best of intentions.CONCLUSIONI hope the above cleared up some questions of the show, as there were many who appeared ""confused"" about the characters. Some were touting Sergeant Jame as an ""adrenaline junkie"" and why some of the actions are taken. Nevertheless, what I have stated above are a fragment of my interpretations for the show. Therefore, they remained just interpretations. Do interpret the show in a more logical and creative ways. Would be nice if you can share that.I have also noticed reviewer's that questioned the accuracy of the show, in terms of equipment, etc. Let there be a reminder that this is a movie production (albeit Hollywood ones), and its not a documentary. Thus there may be basic gaps on the labeling of equipment or summarization on the chain of command.Most important for this show, I believe it captured the combat fatigue in war (not just this war), which I have mentioned above. There are almost no political statements or overly colored terms to dignify the war. Basically through their little actions, the soldiers showed their dedication to their country and the ones beside them most of the time, even if they may not agree with some aspects of it.Therefore, I am giving it a 5 stars because not many modern war movies captured this combat fatigue aspect in a subtle, yet embedded and striking way. (If there are, do share with me).To conclude, it's a must watch for those who have been in the fields.",5,Combat Fatigue and Duty Well-Captured on an Apolitical Show,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,4645,"['INTRONICE', 'Nothing', 'vague', 'words', 'Honor', 'Patriotism', 'men', 'were', 'there', 'do', 'job', 'save', 'lives', 'tried', 'do', 'well', 'go', 'home', 'nicely', 'captured', 'stress', 'prolonged', 'exposure', 'danger', 'deployment', 'What', 'like', 'though', 'was', 'mentioned', 'word', 'Stress', 'Duty', 'other', 'war', 'movies', 'package', 'subtle', 'signs', 'are', 'there', 'see.I', 'found', 'lead', 'review', 'DarthRad', 'titled', 'Taut', 'war', 'drama', 'exploring', 'psychology', 'soldiering', 'fairly', 'relevant', 'Hence', 'will', 'only', 'share', 'certain', 'aspects', 'think', 'was', 'not', 'answered', 'review.Q', 'A', 'Why', 'did', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'prefer', 'combat', 'family', 'Probably', 'man', 'dismantle', 'bomb', 'do', ""n't"", 'grey', 'areas', 'when', 'family', 'love', 'did', 'not', 'communicate', 'well', 'wife', 'loved', 'baby', 'tried', 'calling', 'Iraq', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'say', '.Why', 'did', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'choose', 'bomb', 'dismantling', 'gave', 'adrenaline', 'job', 'others', 'shun', 'one', 'most', 'dangerous', 'job', 'one', 'can', 'Excel', 'have', 'said', 'show', ""n't"", 'keep', 'talking', 'duty', 'can', 'safely', 'assumed', 'not', 'sponsored', 'Neo-Con', 'was', 'performing', 'duty', 'country', 'bringing', 'bread', 'family', 'best', 'way', 'how', 'agreed', 'dangerous', 'way', '.Why', 'did', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'put', 'extra', 'risks', 'when', 'detonating', 'would', 'do', 'understood', 'winning', 'war', 'not', 'only', 'bombing/killing', 'Iraqis', 'show', 'why', 'US', 'Army', 'was', 'better', 'IEDs', 'saw', 'perception', 'winning', 'convincingly', 'eyes', 'Iraqis', 'beat', 'own', 'games.Its', 'well-known', 'US', 'Army', 'got', 'one', 'best', 'technology', 'Thefore', 'was', 'trying', 'show', 'US', 'Army', 'have', 'wits', 'balls', 'overcome', 'sneaky', 'matters', 'terrorists', 'were', 'using', 'Iraqis', 'can', 'call', 'dumb', 'choosing', 'way', 'signal', 'Iraqis', 'what', 'call', 'firm', 'conviction', 'delication.Why', 'did', 'Sgt', 'Sanborn', 'Specialist', 'Eldridge', 'partners', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'stood', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'dangerous', 'antics', 'were', 'conservative', 'risks', 'still', 'protected', 'followed', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'was', 'because', 'too', 'shared', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'belief', 'were', 'there', 'make', 'difference', 'James', 'too', 'knew', 'firefighting', 'daily', 'dismantle', 'bombs', 'would', 'not', 'stop', 'bombs', 'coming', 'actions', 'would', 'turn', 'tide', 'Iraqis', 'opinions', 'stop', 'IEDs', 'coming.There', 'was', 'also', 'aspect', 'dedication', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'partly', 'explained', 'why', 'always', 'covered', 'James', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'fully', 'agreed', 'him.The', 'needs', 'get', 'cause', 'IEDs', 'dedication', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'cumulated', 'when', 'James', 'led', 'chase', 'phantom', 'bombers', 'when', 'was', 'big', 'explosion', 'Greenzone', 'where', 'are', 'called', 'investigate.The', 'fact', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'made', 'sound', 'reasonable', 'judgment', 'did', 'not', 'mean', 'are', 'unsounded', 'mind', 'just', 'showed', 'prolonged', 'combat', 'fatigue', 'daily', 'tensions', 'fog', 'wars', 'different', 'decisions', 'may', 'be', 'chosen', 'best', 'intentions.CONCLUSIONI', 'hope', 'above', 'cleared', 'up', 'questions', 'show', 'were', 'many', 'who', 'appeared', 'confused', 'characters', 'were', 'touting', 'Sergeant', 'Jame', 'adrenaline', 'junkie', 'why', 'actions', 'are', 'taken', 'Nevertheless', 'what', 'have', 'stated', 'above', 'are', 'fragment', 'interpretations', 'show', 'Therefore', 'remained', 'just', 'interpretations', 'Do', 'interpret', 'show', 'more', 'logical', 'creative', 'ways', 'Would', 'be', 'nice', 'can', 'share', 'that.I', 'have', 'also', 'noticed', 'reviewer', 'questioned', 'accuracy', 'show', 'terms', 'equipment', 'etc', 'Let', 'be', 'reminder', 'movie', 'production', 'Hollywood', 'ones', 'not', 'documentary', 'Thus', 'may', 'be', 'basic', 'gaps', 'labeling', 'equipment', 'summarization', 'chain', 'command.Most', 'important', 'show', 'believe', 'captured', 'combat', 'fatigue', 'war', 'not', 'just', 'war', 'have', 'mentioned', 'are', 'almost', 'political', 'statements', 'overly', 'colored', 'terms', 'dignify', 'war', 'Basically', 'little', 'actions', 'soldiers', 'showed', 'dedication', 'country', 'ones', 'most', 'time', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'aspects', 'it.Therefore', 'am', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'not', 'many', 'modern', 'war', 'movies', 'captured', 'combat', 'fatigue', 'aspect', 'subtle', 'yet', 'embedded', 'striking', 'way', 'are', 'do', 'share', '.To', 'conclude', 'must', 'watch', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'fields']",N/A

1252628,A2IDOKLAT1MP8X,B00275EGWY,"Jared Burdick ""JBurd""","[2, 3]","I remember when Platoon came out. My best friend's dad was first cavalry and spent 6 years - yes SIX YEARS in Viet Nam. He said it was pure crap and hated it. He did love Full Metal Jacket, especially boot camp in the first half. I think Hurt Locker falls into the same catagory and will likely win awards like Platoon. This is a GREAT MOVIE. The characters are amazing, the acting is even better and the sense of tension is unbearable because you feel like someone is going to die in virtually every scene. The Hurt Locker is not accurate. There are a lot of incensed reviews from soldiers, a personal friend of mine (an EOD Tech) didn't make through the first 45 minutes and dismissed it as crap. Because Iraq has been a part of most of our lives for the last 9 years, it still hits close to the heart and I think that watching a movie that is essentially ""entertainment"" can be difficult when you have friends or loved ones still there.There are three protagonists, and each represents a ""soldier stereotype"". There's the reckless cowboy, soldier doing his duty and the guy who just wants to make it out alive. Reckless cowboy (Jeremy Renner - future acadamy award winner), takes over a squad and the film moves from point to point with different scenerios. There is no real villian, just the environment that they are in. That is part of the greatness of the film. Although it is pretty much all hollywood, The Hurt Locker does an outstanding job of conveying the sense of pressure that soldiers continually have through tension filled scenes that escalate in severity as the film progresses. Those that pan the movie becuase of how far fetched each scene is fail to realize that a film about a night patrol where nothing happens will not be seen by anyone. The tension IS there only of you are a boots on the ground soldier. The Hurt Locker does an amazing job of giving regular people a glimpse of that pressure.As a film, the quality is simply undeniable. As a BluRay disk, the quality is solid, although not amazing. Being an independent film that didn't make a lot of money or go wide release, this isn't a suprise. I would say from a BluRay disk standpoint, it is middle of the pack. Being a newer film, it still surpasses most movies on BluRay that were released in the early part of the decade, but is no where near the quality of a film like District 9 or Inglorious Basterds. The film is grainy throughout, but that was the way it was made. There are no extras other than a commentary track and on set profile. It would have been nice to see a mini documentary about some realy life EOD Techs or more information about the technology, procedure, training for the film, etc. If it wins enough awards, I would fully expect a second edition that is a Director's Cut or Special Edition with some of these features.

1252629,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B00275EGWY,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[1, 3]","A frontrunner for the Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards, The Hurt Locker deals with a bomb defusing squad on the field in Iraq. When SSG Thompson (Guy Pearce) is killed when a bomb he is trying to defuse is set off, he is replaced as team leader by SFC James (Jeremy Renner). Things don't quite work out the way the other members of the squad, Sgt Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), would like as James is an adrenaline junkie who's prone to not listen to anyone around him. As time goes on he detaches himself further from them, and leads them increasingly into more dangerous situations.Kathryn Bigelow, ex-wife of James ""King of the World"" Cameron, is a woman who has never rested on her laurels. Each time she steps up to a plate to make a movie she makes something completely different. With Near Dark she hit up horror, with Blue Steel she played with the thriller genre, Point Break took on the action genre, and Strange Days took on sci-fi. Having not made a movie since 2002's K-19: The Widowmaker, Bigelow was looking for a new project. She was trying to determine what movie to make when she sent this script to James Cameron who told her to make this movie. Now Bigelow sits as the front runner for Best Director, only the fourth woman in the history of the Academy to receive a nomination, and may possibly even best her ex-husband for the statuette.One of the things that stands out about this film, is that it's a war film that doesn't focus on the idea of whether war is right or wrong, whether or not we should be in Iraq, or if our soldiers are doing good things over there. With a job like bomb defusing, one of the great things, is that you're trying to make a safer environment for both your soldiers as well as the inhabitants that reside in the country you're fighting in. Picking this type of job is a masterful stroke, it allows Bigelow to stay out of politics and focus on the true message of the movie: War is a drug. The main character is a junkie, an adrenaline junkie. More and more he refuses to listen to those around him, and seeks bigger and bigger highs.Really, The Hurt Locker is an excellent character study of how war affects people differently, like drugs, and this war as a drug metaphor is one of the most brilliant things to come from movies based on wars in the past decade or more. On top of that, for an action movie made from only $15 million (that's half the budget of District 9) this movie still looks better than action movies made for over $100 million, with much more to keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, filmed in a style reminiscent of a documentary the film has a certain real life feel to it, like rather than directing actors Bigelow directed a film crew tagging along with soldiers. Unlike many filmmakers these days, Bigelow really knows how to work suspense. Large portions of scenes are waiting for something bad to happen, and you really feel at any moment anyone could die. In a sniper face off, you sit with James and Sanborn on a ridge watching a building kilometers away, worried for your protagonists and hoping that they'll pull of the right shot. The movie doesn't include as much action as you'd expect, but because of the high suspense of the film you feel there's much more action in the film than there really is.The acting in this film is superb, as can be noted by Jeremy Renner's Oscar nomination. But, in reality, this cast deserved the SAG ensemble nomination they didn't get. While Renner's role doesn't stand out as the ""addict"" really everyone does such a great job that you honestly feel this could be a documentary where each of these actors aren't actors, but actual soldiers in the field. Of all the things that stand out, there's a great scene that comes later on in the movie, where Renner's SFC James has to diffuse a bomb strapped to a man who's pleading for his life. It's an extremely suspenseful scene that is also touching as James tries to come up with anything he can to free the man from his burden, and the acting in a scene like that is what makes it so suspenseful as you care for these individuals because of their actions and the way that they carry themselves.I highly recommend The Hurt Locker, definitely one of the best movies of 2009, and one that definitely landed on my top 5 list for that year. If you like war films, suspense, action, drama, and/or a good character study this is definitely one to check out. I know I'll be owning it!5/5",5,The Hurt Locker,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,4491,"['frontrunner', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'bomb', 'defusing', 'squad', 'field', 'Iraq', 'When', 'SSG', 'Thompson', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'killed', 'when', 'bomb', 'trying', 'defuse', 'set', 'off', 'replaced', 'team', 'leader', 'SFC', 'James', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'way', 'other', 'members', 'squad', 'Sgt', 'Sanborn', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Spc', 'Eldridge', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'would', 'like', 'James', 'adrenaline', 'junkie', 'who', 'prone', 'not', 'listen', 'anyone', 'time', 'further', 'increasingly', 'more', 'dangerous', 'situations.Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'ex-wife', 'James', 'King', 'World', 'Cameron', 'woman', 'who', 'never', 'rested', 'laurels', 'time', 'up', 'plate', 'make', 'movie', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'Near', 'Dark', 'hit', 'up', 'horror', 'Blue', 'Steel', 'played', 'thriller', 'genre', 'Point', 'Break', 'took', 'action', 'genre', 'Strange', 'Days', 'took', 'sci-fi', 'Having', 'not', 'made', 'movie', '2002', 'K-19', 'Widowmaker', 'Bigelow', 'was', 'looking', 'new', 'project', 'was', 'trying', 'determine', 'what', 'movie', 'make', 'when', 'sent', 'script', 'James', 'Cameron', 'who', 'told', 'make', 'movie', 'Now', 'Bigelow', 'sits', 'front', 'runner', 'Best', 'Director', 'only', 'fourth', 'woman', 'history', 'Academy', 'receive', 'nomination', 'may', 'possibly', 'even', 'best', 'ex-husband', 'statuette.One', 'things', 'out', 'film', 'war', 'film', ""n't"", 'focus', 'idea', 'war', 'right', 'wrong', 'not', 'should', 'be', 'Iraq', 'soldiers', 'are', 'doing', 'good', 'things', 'there', 'job', 'bomb', 'defusing', 'one', 'great', 'things', ""'re"", 'trying', 'make', 'safer', 'environment', 'soldiers', 'as', 'well', 'inhabitants', 'reside', 'country', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'Picking', 'type', 'job', 'masterful', 'stroke', 'Bigelow', 'stay', 'politics', 'focus', 'true', 'message', 'movie', 'War', 'drug', 'main', 'character', 'junkie', 'adrenaline', 'junkie', 'More', 'more', 'listen', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'highs.Really', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'excellent', 'character', 'study', 'how', 'war', 'people', 'differently', 'drugs', 'war', 'drug', 'metaphor', 'one', 'most', 'brilliant', 'things', 'come', 'movies', 'based', 'wars', 'past', 'decade', 'more', 'top', 'action', 'movie', 'made', 'only', '15', 'million', 'budget', 'District', '9', 'movie', 'still', 'better', 'action', 'movies', 'made', '100', 'million', 'much', 'more', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'Also', 'filmed', 'style', 'reminiscent', 'documentary', 'film', 'certain', 'real', 'life', 'feel', 'rather', 'directing', 'actors', 'Bigelow', 'directed', 'film', 'crew', 'tagging', 'soldiers', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'days', 'Bigelow', 'really', 'how', 'work', 'suspense', 'Large', 'portions', 'scenes', 'are', 'waiting', 'something', 'bad', 'happen', 'really', 'feel', 'moment', 'anyone', 'could', 'die', 'sniper', 'face', 'sit', 'James', 'Sanborn', 'ridge', 'watching', 'building', 'away', 'worried', 'protagonists', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'pull', 'right', 'shot', 'movie', ""n't"", 'include', 'as', 'much', 'action', ""'d"", 'expect', 'high', 'suspense', 'film', 'feel', 'much', 'more', 'action', 'film', 'really', 'is.The', 'acting', 'film', 'superb', 'can', 'be', 'noted', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'reality', 'cast', 'deserved', 'SAG', 'ensemble', 'nomination', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Renner', 'role', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'addict', 'really', 'everyone', 'great', 'job', 'honestly', 'feel', 'could', 'be', 'documentary', 'where', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'actors', 'actual', 'soldiers', 'field', 'things', 'stand', 'out', 'great', 'scene', 'later', 'movie', 'where', 'Renner', 'SFC', 'James', 'diffuse', 'bomb', 'strapped', 'man', 'who', 'pleading', 'life', 'extremely', 'suspenseful', 'scene', 'also', 'touching', 'James', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'can', 'free', 'man', 'burden', 'acting', 'scene', 'what', 'so', 'suspenseful', 'care', 'individuals', 'actions', 'way', 'carry', 'themselves.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '2009', 'one', 'definitely', 'landed', 'top', '5', 'list', 'year', 'like', 'war', 'films', 'suspense', 'action', 'drama', 'and/or', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'definitely', 'one', 'check', 'out', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'owning', '5/5']",N/A

1252642,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,B00275EGWY,Jiang Xueqin,"[1, 10]","""The Hurt Locker"" begins when a U.S. army bomb technician is killed, and he is replaced by Staff Sergeant James, a reckless ex-Ranger for whom ""war is a drug."" He is the anti-hero of Kathryn Bigelow's film, a man so addicted to and absorbed with danger that he recklessly puts at risk his two teammates and cannot even talk to his wife. The man is in fact so narcissistic that he mistakenly identifies a young boy who is killed and turned into a human bomb as a boy he knows, and madly jumps alone into the dark night in search of the boy's killers.As a psychopath Sergeant James should have gotten his two teammates killed, but somehow he manages to save both. Specialist Eldridge becomes depressed and angry when he fails to shoot dead the man responsible for his sergeant's death. He encourages his psychiatrist to visit the field, and the psychiatrist does, only to be blown away by an IED. On his last mission Eldridge is almost kidnapped by insurgents, but is saved by Sergeant James and Sergeant Sanborn. James shoots Eldridge's foot, ending Eldridge's tour. Eldridge understandably blames James' reckless heroics for his plight, but if Eldridge had stayed in the battlefield he would have probably gone insane. And then there's Sanborn, who as an intelligence officer turned bomb tech support thought he was like James, but James showed him that couldn't possibly be true. In the end, when a bomb almost kills him, Sanborn decides he wants to live, and wants to finally hold a baby son in his hands.When James is finally holding his baby son with his own hands, James can only tell him that he wasn't meant to raise a family; in fact he was meant to do only one thing. The movie closes with James returning to Iraq, and heading to defuse a bomb by himself.The movie has received much critical acclaim, and while there's a striking ambiguity and ambivalence to the film that is rare in Hollywood it nevertheless is a shallow and predictable film. There's a lot to commend about the film. The nameless faceless enemy that James and his team battle are everywhere and nowhere, and is an apt representation of the enemy that the Americans are facing in Iraq: against resourceful numerous phantoms the war is to survive, not to win. James is an interesting character, but he's really underdeveloped, and we're supposed to take his complexity at face value when the director works very little to develop his full complexity. The movie's major limitation though is the hackneyed plot lines and story arcs that it follows.In terms of an artistic documentation of the war as well as a parable into the horrors of war HBO's ""Generation Kill"" is far more appealing. In the 7-part series a platoon of recon Marines is spearheading the invasion of Iraq. They are armed and ready to kill, but there's a splendid innocence to them. They joke around easily, and they share a strong bond that only imminent danger could instill. The stupidity and arrogance of war and its planners soon overwhelm them, and by the end they're fighting and bickering amongst themselves, questioning their very identity as American soldiers. The executive producers were the same team that created ""The Wire,"" and ""Generation Kill"" also had the same raw, gritty feel that made ""The Wire"" so compelling to watch.Compared with ""Generation Kill"" Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"" seems insincere and flawed.",4,Shallow and Predictable,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,3369,"['Hurt', 'Locker', 'when', 'U.S.', 'army', 'bomb', 'technician', 'killed', 'replaced', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'reckless', 'ex-Ranger', 'whom', 'war', 'drug', 'anti-hero', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'film', 'man', 'so', 'addicted', 'absorbed', 'danger', 'recklessly', 'risk', 'two', 'teammates', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'talk', 'wife', 'man', 'fact', 'so', 'narcissistic', 'mistakenly', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'killed', 'turned', 'human', 'bomb', 'boy', 'madly', 'jumps', 'alone', 'dark', 'night', 'search', 'boy', 'killers.As', 'psychopath', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'two', 'teammates', 'killed', 'somehow', 'save', 'Specialist', 'Eldridge', 'depressed', 'angry', 'when', 'shoot', 'dead', 'man', 'responsible', 'sergeant', 'death', 'psychiatrist', 'visit', 'field', 'psychiatrist', 'only', 'be', 'blown', 'away', 'IED', 'last', 'mission', 'Eldridge', 'almost', 'kidnapped', 'insurgents', 'saved', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'Sergeant', 'Sanborn', 'James', 'shoots', 'Eldridge', 'foot', 'ending', 'Eldridge', 'tour', 'Eldridge', 'understandably', 'James', 'reckless', 'heroics', 'plight', 'Eldridge', 'had', 'stayed', 'battlefield', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'gone', 'insane', 'then', 'Sanborn', 'who', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'turned', 'bomb', 'tech', 'support', 'thought', 'was', 'James', 'James', 'showed', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'be', 'true', 'end', 'when', 'bomb', 'almost', 'Sanborn', 'live', 'finally', 'hold', 'baby', 'son', 'hands.When', 'James', 'finally', 'holding', 'baby', 'son', 'own', 'hands', 'James', 'can', 'only', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'raise', 'family', 'fact', 'was', 'meant', 'do', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'James', 'returning', 'Iraq', 'heading', 'defuse', 'bomb', 'himself.The', 'movie', 'received', 'much', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'striking', 'ambiguity', 'ambivalence', 'film', 'rare', 'Hollywood', 'nevertheless', 'shallow', 'predictable', 'film', 'lot', 'commend', 'film', 'nameless', 'faceless', 'enemy', 'James', 'team', 'battle', 'are', 'everywhere', 'nowhere', 'apt', 'representation', 'enemy', 'Americans', 'are', 'facing', 'Iraq', 'resourceful', 'numerous', 'phantoms', 'war', 'survive', 'not', 'win', 'James', 'interesting', 'character', 'really', 'underdeveloped', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'take', 'complexity', 'face', 'value', 'when', 'director', 'very', 'little', 'develop', 'full', 'complexity', 'movie', 'major', 'limitation', 'hackneyed', 'plot', 'lines', 'story', 'arcs', 'follows.In', 'terms', 'artistic', 'documentation', 'war', 'as', 'well', 'parable', 'horrors', 'war', 'HBO', 'Generation', 'Kill', 'far', 'more', 'appealing', '7-part', 'series', 'platoon', 'recon', 'Marines', 'spearheading', 'invasion', 'Iraq', 'are', 'armed', 'ready', 'kill', 'splendid', 'innocence', 'joke', 'easily', 'share', 'strong', 'bond', 'only', 'imminent', 'danger', 'could', 'instill', 'stupidity', 'arrogance', 'war', 'planners', 'soon', 'overwhelm', 'end', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'bickering', 'amongst', 'questioning', 'very', 'identity', 'American', 'soldiers', 'executive', 'producers', 'were', 'same', 'team', 'created', 'Wire', 'Generation', 'Kill', 'also', 'had', 'same', 'raw', 'gritty', 'feel', 'made', 'Wire', 'so', 'compelling', 'watch.Compared', 'Generation', 'Kill', 'Bigelow', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'insincere', 'flawed']",N/A

Finally I watched it hoping that it would set aside my concerns over whether or not this movie was worthy of the Best Picture award.The film is set in Iraq and follows a team of demolition experts.  Most people, myself included, have little appreciation for placing themselves at risk to diffuse the myriad of homemade bombs that are used against American troops in our two current overseas wars.  But these men are willing to risk life and limb to do their duty.This will not be an ethical or moral debate on the wars.  They are what they are.  But I still am puzzled over how this film won Best Picture.  The movies dragged on from scene to scene without really developing its characters.  But then look at the real war in Iraq.  It drags on from year to year and there seems to be no real sense of purpose now that Saddam Hussein has been deposed and dead for more than eight years.  The film ecoes this sense of forlornness that many feel when thinking about the war.This is a good movie that has decent actors performing a decent script.  It has drama, tension, some humor, and a lot of relief once the bombs are disabled.  Ther eal war is winding down, but at what cost?  Aside from the dead on both sides there is the need to rebuild in an era when rebuilding may just lead to the next petty dictator rising to power and muscling his way onto the world scene.

Filmed in Jordan, it is also extremely realistic looking in the portrayal of a mideastern city and the residents, although many Iraq veterans are critical of the film's depiction of how the army and the EOD teams actually operate.  The movie centers entirely on the three members of the EOD (""bomb squad""), particularly the squad leader Sgt James, extremely well played by Jeremy Renner.  In-between the bomb disarming scenes, the movie develops the relationships between the three men and especially explores the character Sgt James.The one thing this movie lacks is any actual storyline or plot as such.  At the beginning of the movie Sgt James arrives; there are a bunch of individual action segments depicting disarming bombs or perhaps the squad being pinned down by a sniper; and then the movie ends with a segment that completes the portrait of Sgt James' character.  The action segments are unrelated and in fact could be rearranged in almost any order with minor changes for continuity.  There is no unfolding ""story"" that builds to a climax and then is resolved at the end.  The only thing that is ""built"" throughout the movie is the relationships between the squad members and the character study of Sgt James, and in fact it is that character study which provides the movie's climax (in a scene between him and his toddler son, where we understand what ultimately drives him).  Basically, this movie is NOT plot-driven but is more of a character study.  With bombs.The bomb sequences provide most of the suspense for the movie, and they are very gritty, white-knuckle hold-your-breath scenes.  Unless you find disarming-bomb-scenes to get a little old after a while, in which case you may find yourself patiently waiting through them.

1252647,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00275EGWY,John F. Rooney,"[3, 7]","""The Hurt Locker,"" this year's Oscar winner, is a very intense Iraq combat film in which Staff Sergeant James (played by Jeremy Renner) is extremely fearless and very adept at defusing planted bombs, but very inept at protecting from harm the men he works closest with. He's a risk-taker, a reckless soldier, who is baffled by civilian life but thrives on the danger of his mission. As a civilian, a fish out of water, an endless line of cereal products in a supermarket flummoxes him, and is a mine field, but yet in a real mine field, he thrives on danger and facing death every day.He's a complex person who walks fearlessly into an area planted with bombs, but he's not a person to be envied, admired or emulated.Ironically he has probably saved hundreds of lives by his bomb defusing skills, but saving lives isn't really what motivates him. It is his own personal adrenaline rush, his egotism, and self-absorption which keeps him going. He's not a war lover per se who goes out and slaughters the enemy indiscriminately, but he has the perfect job for his personality because it gives him a chance to play a kind of Russian roulette with his life.The movie shows him in off-duty situations. He's a heavy drinker, heavy-smoker, and a person who enjoys violent interplay with his mates. They don't like him; they hate him and fear him even though at times he briefly shows compassion towards them. He's a man's man in his own mind, a cowboy, but basically a loner.Though filmed in Jordan, you get the feeling that you really are in the mean streets of Iraq. The movie won't bore you; it's violent and bloody, but it's the character of Sergeant James that will stay with you.

Everything the characters say has been said in other movies, they are more stereotypes than not, and I think anyone with a cursory knowledge of the military (and by that I mean someone familiar with Call of Duty video games and the History channel) will find all kinds of Military inaccuracies;  I can only imagine what some of our servicemen thought when watching this.

1252657,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00275EGWY,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[13, 18]","The Hurt Locker opens with a quote; ""the rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug."" Kathryn Bigelow's film is probably the most acclaimed film of the year, ending up on many critics' top 10 lists, with Roger Ebert going so far as to call it the 2nd best film of the decade. When a film receives such monumental acclaim, it's hard to imagine it living up to expectations and you will find those who have already called The Hurt Locker overrated and disappointing...I was skeptical, I'll admit, but The Hurt Locker delivers.Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are part of a bomb-defusing squad in Baghdad. In the beautifully filmed, poetic opening scene their sergeant (Guy Pearce) is killed when a bomb goes off. SSgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) is brought in to replace him. Sanborn and Eldridge notice immediately that James is more reckless than their previous technician and he has no reservations about it. He's not cocky, but he knows he's good at his job...Even when he's putting both himself and his team in more danger than necessary.Some familiar faces pop up for brief appearances, actors like David Morse and Ralph Fiennes but the film is owned by Renner and Mackie. The acting in this film has been raved about, but this acclaim has been muffled with more focus being cast on the film as a whole and its female director. This is unfair because both Renner and Mackie carry the film and they both give terrific performances. The acting here is subtle; these are not powerhouse, fishing for an Oscar-type performances. It's the subtlety of the performances, the tapping into real people rather than characters that make these performances great. Renner, especially, nails his role as the adrenaline junkie. Here's an actor that once made Jeffrey Dahmer a sympathetic character and here he really brings you into the mind of James, showing how he thrives on his job rather than just presenting this to you. Both actors breathe so much life into their characters, they rarely let you in on the fact that they are acting...Their performances seem real.In the film industry, the most celebrated directors are almost unanimously male. Kathryn Bigelow has now made her presence known amongst her male colleagues (notably her ex-husband James Cameron, who has also been celebrating the critical and financial success of a ""small"" film he made), showing that a woman can handle challenging, powerful material that is typically left to male directors. If she were to win the Best Director Academy Award that she will inevitably be nominated for, she will definitely deserve it.The Hurt Locker works as an action/suspense film and a character study/human drama simultaneously. It's remarkable that Bigelow has managed to balance it out so well, making a film that will appeal to different people for different reasons. Aside from getting into the mind of its main character, it has some intense scenes of heart-racing action; made even more effective by the very real setting...The film was shot in Jordan, at times only three miles from the Iraqi border. Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd deserves his share of credit, using frenetic, yet coherent filming techniques that adds to the realism without making the film hard to follow. Not being a Hollywood production, The Hurt Locker benefits even further by not being afraid to enter darker places that would have been ignored and/or glossed-over to conform to Hollywood standards.I've never been big on war movies, but The Hurt Locker completely exceeded my expectations. It's a great film, easily one of the best of 2009 and it's hard to imagine another film about the Iraq war topping this in scope, entertainment value, or relevance. This film is not just a flash in the pan either and I think that it will continue to gather more acclaim as the years pass. It's a true masterpiece; poetic, exciting, and memorable.GRADE: A",5,One of the Best Films of 2009; A Remarkable Movie,1263427200,"01 14, 2010",2010,3945,"['Hurt', 'Locker', 'quote', 'rush', 'battle', 'often', 'potent', 'lethal', 'addiction', 'war', 'drug', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'film', 'probably', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'film', 'year', 'ending', 'up', 'many', 'critics', 'top', '10', 'lists', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'call', '2nd', 'best', 'film', 'decade', 'When', 'film', 'receives', 'such', 'monumental', 'acclaim', 'hard', 'imagine', 'living', 'up', 'expectations', 'will', 'find', 'who', 'have', 'already', 'called', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'overrated', 'disappointing', 'was', 'skeptical', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'delivers.Sgt', 'JT', 'Sanborn', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Spc', 'Owen', 'Eldridge', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'are', 'part', 'bomb-defusing', 'squad', 'Baghdad', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'poetic', 'opening', 'sergeant', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'killed', 'when', 'bomb', 'off', 'SSgt', 'William', 'James', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'brought', 'replace', 'Sanborn', 'Eldridge', 'notice', 'immediately', 'James', 'more', 'reckless', 'previous', 'technician', 'reservations', 'not', 'cocky', 'good', 'job', 'Even', 'when', 'putting', 'team', 'more', 'danger', 'necessary.Some', 'familiar', 'pop', 'up', 'brief', 'appearances', 'actors', 'David', 'Morse', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'film', 'owned', 'Renner', 'Mackie', 'acting', 'film', 'been', 'raved', 'acclaim', 'been', 'muffled', 'more', 'focus', 'being', 'cast', 'film', 'whole', 'female', 'director', 'unfair', 'Renner', 'Mackie', 'carry', 'film', 'give', 'terrific', 'performances', 'acting', 'here', 'subtle', 'are', 'not', 'powerhouse', 'fishing', 'Oscar-type', 'performances', 'subtlety', 'performances', 'tapping', 'real', 'people', 'rather', 'characters', 'make', 'performances', 'great', 'Renner', 'especially', 'role', 'adrenaline', 'junkie', 'Here', 'actor', 'once', 'made', 'Jeffrey', 'Dahmer', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'here', 'really', 'mind', 'James', 'showing', 'how', 'job', 'rather', 'just', 'presenting', 'actors', 'breathe', 'so', 'much', 'life', 'characters', 'rarely', 'let', 'fact', 'are', 'acting', 'performances', 'seem', 'film', 'industry', 'most', 'celebrated', 'directors', 'are', 'almost', 'unanimously', 'male', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'now', 'made', 'presence', 'known', 'male', 'colleagues', 'notably', 'ex-husband', 'James', 'Cameron', 'who', 'also', 'been', 'celebrating', 'critical', 'financial', 'success', 'small', 'film', 'made', 'showing', 'woman', 'can', 'handle', 'challenging', 'powerful', 'material', 'typically', 'left', 'male', 'directors', 'were', 'win', 'Best', 'Director', 'Academy', 'Award', 'will', 'inevitably', 'be', 'nominated', 'will', 'definitely', 'deserve', 'it.The', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'action/suspense', 'film', 'character', 'study/human', 'drama', 'simultaneously', 'remarkable', 'Bigelow', 'managed', 'balance', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'making', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'different', 'people', 'different', 'reasons', 'Aside', 'getting', 'mind', 'main', 'character', 'intense', 'scenes', 'heart-racing', 'action', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'effective', 'very', 'real', 'setting', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Jordan', 'times', 'only', 'three', 'miles', 'Iraqi', 'border', 'Cinematographer', 'Barry', 'Ackroyd', 'share', 'credit', 'using', 'frenetic', 'yet', 'coherent', 'filming', 'techniques', 'realism', 'making', 'film', 'hard', 'follow', 'Not', 'being', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'benefits', 'even', 'further', 'not', 'being', 'afraid', 'enter', 'darker', 'places', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ignored', 'and/or', 'glossed-over', 'conform', 'Hollywood', 'standards.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'war', 'movies', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'completely', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'great', 'film', 'easily', 'one', 'best', '2009', 'hard', 'imagine', 'film', 'Iraq', 'war', 'topping', 'scope', 'entertainment', 'value', 'relevance', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'flash', 'pan', 'think', 'will', 'continue', 'gather', 'more', 'acclaim', 'years', 'pass', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'poetic', 'exciting', 'memorable.GRADE']",N/A

In a sense the movie is a personality assessment, with the main character (James) being an arrogant, selfish, virtually sociopathic pursuer of the ""thrill of nearly dying.""  I can't agree with the thesis of the film ""War is a Drug,"" because although I've never been in a war, I really doubt that those who have been in serious combat think that way, especially when their compatriots are getting killed.  Is war exciting?  I'm sure of it.  But I believe that soldiers enlist for far more than ""the adrenaline rush"" that James seems to be addicted to.  (love of country maybe?  loyalty to their fellow soldiers?  Wanting to do good in the world?)In the film, the tense battle and bomb-defusing scenes give one the strong impression of being within a combat operation (without risking one's own life of course!  Isn't that why we like war movies?), and many unexpected things happen. Thus the entertainment value is high.  But I ALWAYS look at the underlying messages of movies, not just for entertainment.The main character definitely thinks he's indestructable.  I call him borderline-sociopathic (or narcissistic, or abusive) because I've known men like him, and I believe that they have a personality of extreme selfishness and the desire to ALWAYS be the guy on top & bossing everyone around, often seeking high danger. (BTW If you know someone like that, my advice is to get away!  Don't work with them, befriend them or marry them!)  I don't know how such a person would really hold up in the military -- he might not last long, because he's constantly putting his comrades in danger.  But the good thing about The Hurt Locker is that the other 2 main characters in his squad (the black Sargent and the specialist) have a hard time dealing with James and tell him so on many occasions.  So the director ""gets it"" in a way.  But I hated it when James called the black Sargent ""boy"" when they were drunk -- what a flipping abusive ass he comes across as!The Iraq environment is realistically portrayed as tense, and alternately filled with teeming crowds (from whom you have no idea who your enemy is) and barren desert.  I'm interested in whether the Iraqi (insurgent) men are portrayed accurately.  If the director got it right, they look extremely defiant, always pushing the limits, very two-faced, ruthless, and always defying death themselves, in their zeal to kill the US soldiers.  I'd be interested if soldiers that served over there think that the movie got this right.Altogether I have to give the film 4 stars for its gritty realism and entertainment value, although it's still got its flaws.",4,"Engrossing and Gritty Micro-Look at Military Personalities, but Flawed",1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,2707,"['Definitely', 'engrossing', 'micro', 'view', 'counter-insurgency', 'warfare', 'Iraq', 'small', 'bomb-squad', 'sense', 'movie', 'personality', 'assessment', 'main', 'character', 'James', 'being', 'arrogant', 'selfish', 'virtually', 'sociopathic', 'pursuer', 'thrill', 'nearly', 'dying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'thesis', 'film', 'War', 'Drug', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'war', 'really', 'doubt', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'serious', 'combat', 'think', 'way', 'especially', 'when', 'compatriots', 'are', 'getting', 'killed', 'Is', 'war', 'exciting', ""'m"", 'sure', 'believe', 'soldiers', 'enlist', 'far', 'more', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'James', 'be', 'addicted', 'country', 'maybe', 'loyalty', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'Wanting', 'do', 'good', 'world', 'film', 'tense', 'battle', 'bomb-defusing', 'scenes', 'give', 'one', 'strong', 'impression', 'being', 'combat', 'operation', 'risking', 'one', 'own', 'life', 'course', ""n't"", 'that', 'why', 'like', 'war', 'movies', 'many', 'unexpected', 'things', 'happen', 'Thus', 'entertainment', 'value', 'high', 'ALWAYS', 'look', 'underlying', 'messages', 'movies', 'not', 'just', 'entertainment.The', 'main', 'character', 'definitely', 'indestructable', 'call', 'borderline-sociopathic', 'narcissistic', 'abusive', ""'ve"", 'known', 'men', 'believe', 'have', 'personality', 'extreme', 'selfishness', 'desire', 'ALWAYS', 'be', 'guy', 'top', 'bossing', 'everyone', 'around', 'often', 'seeking', 'high', 'danger', 'know', 'someone', 'advice', 'get', 'away', 'Do', ""n't"", 'work', 'befriend', 'marry', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'such', 'person', 'would', 'really', 'hold', 'up', 'military', 'might', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'constantly', 'putting', 'comrades', 'danger', 'good', 'thing', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'other', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'squad', 'black', 'Sargent', 'specialist', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'dealing', 'James', 'tell', 'so', 'many', 'occasions', 'director', 'way', 'hated', 'when', 'James', 'called', 'black', 'Sargent', 'boy', 'when', 'were', 'drunk', 'what', 'flipping', 'abusive', 'ass', 'Iraq', 'environment', 'realistically', 'portrayed', 'tense', 'alternately', 'filled', 'teeming', 'crowds', 'whom', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'enemy', 'desert', ""'m"", 'interested', 'Iraqi', 'insurgent', 'men', 'are', 'portrayed', 'accurately', 'director', 'got', 'right', 'look', 'extremely', 'defiant', 'always', 'pushing', 'limits', 'very', 'two-faced', 'ruthless', 'always', 'defying', 'death', 'zeal', 'kill', 'US', 'soldiers', ""'d"", 'be', 'interested', 'soldiers', 'served', 'there', 'think', 'movie', 'got', 'right.Altogether', 'have', 'give', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'gritty', 'realism', 'entertainment', 'value', 'still', 'got', 'flaws']",N/A

1252665,AABGV02YMQ2OZ,B00275EGWY,"J. Ryan ""JRyan""","[3, 5]","I will be the first to say that I am sick and tired of hearing about the war in Iraq. Obviously I don't mean that in the sense that I don't care about the war and think that we, as citizens of a country fighting in this war, shouldn't concern ourselves with it. I mean this in the sense that I am sick and tired of hearing these radical left and right wing media outlets simply bickering back and forth about it. All we hear is how it was a mistake to enter into this war and we should pull out our troops immediately, or on the flip side how it was necessary to enter because we believed they had weapons of mass destruction and we needed to free the Iraqi people from Saddam Hussein's reign of terror. It's been over 5 years now'get over it. We are at war in Iraq and there is nothing we can do about it. This is one of the many reasons why The Hurt Locker was such a brilliant film. It is a war movie with absolutely no political agenda behind it whatsoever. It is a brutally honest portrayal of the Iraq War. It isn't about why we are at war. It isn't about why we shouldn't  be at war. It is about being at war'and this war is absolute hell.The specific group of soldiers that this film follows is the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) whose job is to, very simply, find and disarm bombs. The biggest thing that makes the Iraq war so much different than any other war, and what this film does a excellent job of portraying, is that these troops aren't fighting a country or a known enemy. They are trying to fight the unstoppable force of terror, and there are no battle lines in this fight. Besides the soldiers wearing a uniform, the troops fighting this war on terror have no idea who their enemy is and isn't. The film makes this clear from the very first scene, where we see Sgt. Matt Thompson (Guy Pierce) walking up to a pile of bombs they have just discovered and that he is attempting to disarm. His fellow commanders, Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) frantically look around trying to spot any suspicious onlookers who would could be trying to detonate the bombs. By the time they spot any terrorist it could already be too late. This constant sense of urgency, panic and fear is felt in each scene  as the EOD squad knows that their unknown enemy could strike at any time.The movie also acts as a mini character study of Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) for whom this war has become a drug. While disarming the explosives, he almost never shows any sign of fear or panic despite knowing that even the slightest wrong move could kill him. He has become consumed and obsessed by the adrenaline rush he receives with the finding and disarming of each bomb. When this ""drug"" is taken away from him and he is at home with his family, he appears emotionless and empty. There is a great little scene towards the end of the film where he is in a grocery store shopping with his wife and kid and is asked to go pick out a box of cereal. He is then shown standing alone in an aisle staring blankly into dozens of different cereal boxes. He has a look of complete detachment and hopelessness in his face. He has been able to disarm close 900 bombs with complete ease, and now even the simplest task of picking out groceries seems impossible.The Hurt Locker is a near perfect film. It is both an uncompromising and brutally realistic look at the hopelessness and paranoia that our troops are facing everyday in Iraq, as well as a poignant and engrossing character study of a man who has become consumed by war. The film's tag line reads ""You'll know when you're in it."" While an audience could never fully understand what it is like to be fighting this war on terror by watching a movie, this comes as close as you can get to a first hand account.Grade: 9.5/10-Jeffrey Ryan[...]",5,It's about being at war--and this war is absolute Hell,1253404800,"09 20, 2009",2009,3836,"['will', 'be', 'first', 'say', 'am', 'sick', 'tired', 'hearing', 'war', 'Iraq', 'Obviously', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'sense', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'war', 'think', 'citizens', 'country', 'fighting', 'war', 'should', ""n't"", 'concern', 'mean', 'sense', 'am', 'sick', 'tired', 'hearing', 'radical', 'left', 'right', 'wing', 'media', 'outlets', 'simply', 'bickering', 'back', 'forth', 'hear', 'how', 'was', 'mistake', 'enter', 'war', 'should', 'pull', 'out', 'troops', 'immediately', 'flip', 'side', 'how', 'was', 'necessary', 'enter', 'believed', 'had', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'needed', 'free', 'Iraqi', 'people', 'Saddam', 'Hussein', 'reign', 'terror', 'been', '5', 'years', ""now'get"", 'are', 'war', 'Iraq', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'was', 'such', 'brilliant', 'film', 'war', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'political', 'agenda', 'brutally', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'Iraq', 'War', ""n't"", 'about', 'why', 'are', 'war', ""n't"", 'about', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'war', 'being', ""war'and"", 'war', 'absolute', 'hell.The', 'specific', 'group', 'soldiers', 'film', 'Explosive', 'Ordnance', 'Disposal', 'EOD', 'job', 'very', 'simply', 'find', 'disarm', 'bombs', 'biggest', 'thing', 'Iraq', 'war', 'so', 'much', 'different', 'other', 'war', 'what', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'troops', 'are', ""n't"", 'fighting', 'country', 'known', 'enemy', 'are', 'trying', 'fight', 'unstoppable', 'force', 'terror', 'are', 'battle', 'lines', 'fight', 'soldiers', 'wearing', 'uniform', 'troops', 'fighting', 'war', 'terror', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'enemy', ""n't"", 'film', 'clear', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'where', 'see', 'Sgt', 'Matt', 'Thompson', 'Guy', 'Pierce', 'walking', 'up', 'pile', 'bombs', 'have', 'just', 'discovered', 'attempting', 'disarm', 'fellow', 'commanders', 'Sgt', 'JT', 'Sanborn', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Specialist', 'Owen', 'Eldridge', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'frantically', 'look', 'around', 'trying', 'spot', 'suspicious', 'onlookers', 'who', 'would', 'could', 'be', 'trying', 'detonate', 'bombs', 'time', 'spot', 'terrorist', 'could', 'already', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'constant', 'sense', 'urgency', 'panic', 'fear', 'felt', 'scene', 'EOD', 'squad', 'unknown', 'enemy', 'could', 'strike', 'time.The', 'movie', 'also', 'mini', 'character', 'study', 'Staff', 'Sgt', 'William', 'James', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'whom', 'war', 'become', 'drug', 'disarming', 'explosives', 'almost', 'never', 'sign', 'fear', 'panic', 'knowing', 'even', 'slightest', 'wrong', 'move', 'could', 'kill', 'become', 'consumed', 'obsessed', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'finding', 'disarming', 'bomb', 'When', 'drug', 'taken', 'away', 'home', 'family', 'emotionless', 'empty', 'great', 'little', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'where', 'grocery', 'store', 'shopping', 'wife', 'kid', 'asked', 'go', 'pick', 'out', 'box', 'cereal', 'then', 'shown', 'standing', 'alone', 'aisle', 'staring', 'blankly', 'dozens', 'different', 'cereal', 'boxes', 'look', 'complete', 'detachment', 'hopelessness', 'face', 'been', 'able', 'disarm', 'close', '900', 'bombs', 'complete', 'ease', 'now', 'even', 'simplest', 'task', 'picking', 'out', 'groceries', 'impossible.The', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'near', 'perfect', 'film', 'uncompromising', 'brutally', 'realistic', 'look', 'hopelessness', 'paranoia', 'troops', 'are', 'facing', 'everyday', 'Iraq', 'as', 'well', 'poignant', 'engrossing', 'character', 'study', 'man', 'who', 'become', 'consumed', 'war', 'film', 'tag', 'line', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', ""'re"", 'audience', 'could', 'never', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'be', 'fighting', 'war', 'terror', 'watching', 'movie', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'get', 'first', 'hand', 'account.Grade', '9.5/10-Jeffrey', 'Ryan', '[', ']']",N/A

1252667,A3BRHTAUBZUGK8,B00275EGWY,"Jym Cherry ""Writing Under The Influence of Ro...","[2, 7]","There's no story, no heroic plot to Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker. There's no search for prisoners, no tracking of a villain, no hostages to rescue, no hill to liberate, or town to capture, or even a search for looted gold. There's not even an overarching allegory of life or war built into the theme of the movie. Despite this lack of war movie plots The Hurt Locker is still compelling with the only goal of the characters, is to stay alive.The Hurt Locker follows the lives of a team of EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit members, Sergeant First Class Will James (Jeremy Renner), Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Gerahty) as they finish the last five weeks of their deployment in Iraq. Their job in Iraq is to defuse IED's (Improvised Explosive Devices) and after their first Sergeant (Guy Pearce) is killed Staff Sergeant William James is assigned to the unit. Sanborn and Eldridge discover that James takes more risks in the field than their previous Sergeant and is addicted to the adrenaline surge of war which is putting them at risk. They find themselves in the position of finding out if they can live (literally) with James' approach to the job.Kathryn Bigelow's direction isn't heavy handed and neither does she use a heavy hand in imparting themes or other usual theatrical devices. The Hurt Locker is a very naturalistic representation of the Iraq war zone. While it touches on aspects of war that other movies have, such as the surreal aspect of war that Apocalypse Now illustrates or the dual nature of war that's found in Platoon, she lets them exist as a natural part of the world the characters find themselves in. This low key, naturalistic approach is also evident in the actor's portrayal of their characters. There's no big emotional blow ups between them, no huge revelations of a characters' back stories to pull on your heartstrings. The film highlights just what occurs naturally from the job they're there to do. The movie also doesn't take a political stance on the war. It's neither anti-war nor pro-war. It puts the viewer in the situation with the characters and you're free to feel or have whatever reaction the events stimulate in you. Bigelow even sparingly uses a soundtrack. It's more of a tense buzzing that keeps us feeling a little uneasy, as must soldiers in the field feel.The Hurt Locker was written by Mark Boal who had been an embedded reporter with an OED unit in Iraq in 2004. While the story is fictionalized, many of the events shown were based on actual events Boal either witnessed or heard about from soldiers in the field.Bonus Features: The Hurt Locker DVD has a small bonus feature section that includes an audio commentary that I found a bit lackluster, but I thought was more than compensated for with an image gallery section that includes a Q and A session from the Institute of Contemporary Art in London.

In THE HURT LOCKER, the tiger is the ever-present possibility of being blown to bits, and the main character faces it head on.Set in Iraq, the three men of Bravo Company's EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) team have a healthy respect for roadside bombs. But despite taking all precautions, disaster strikes, leaving the team down a man. The replacement, Staff Sergeant James, is a self-confident veteran of Afghanistan whose first act is to remove the protective barrier over the windows of his barracks. He declares that he likes the sunlight and that the plywood won't protect him from an impact on the ceiling, anyway. It's the first hint that his world view might be a little different from that of the other members of the EOD. The first mission leaves no doubt of that. Upon arrival at the scene of the improvised explosive device (IED), SSgt. James refuses to use the remotely controlled robot, opting instead to wear ""the suit"" and search for the bomb himself. Since the bomb could be detonated at anytime from any of the buildings lining the street, SSgt. James' choice to go on foot seems insane, especially to his own men. Everyone, including the audience, is left wondering what would make a man take such unnecessary risks, but SSgt. James does so time and again. It is absolutely no surprise when, at the close of the movie, we see him returning to Iraq for another 365-day tour of duty. The simple fact is that he loves his work.I couldn't write this review for several days after seeing THE HURT LOCKER. I had to let it simmer on my subconscious for a while. The filmmakers wisely chose to stay away from any political statements and any kind of subjective commentary by the characters. All of the characters are 100% believable (to a civilian, at any rate), and they all seem 100% sane within the context of their own actions. This is to say that while I would not don the suit and march up to an IED, I do not see SSgt. James' willingness, nay eagerness, to do so any more insane than a racing driver who loves to roar around the track at more than 200mph. This man loved his work. It focused him and made him feel alive. And he was very good at it.The movie also reminded me of classics such as The Best Years of Our Lives, the William Wyler movie that depicted the difficulties of returning WWII veterans. While THE HURT LOCKER doesn't dwell on this aspect, it shows it starkly in about 3 minutes worth of scenes. The most jarring is a pair of scenes which start with a horrible incident in Iraq and switch almost immediately to SSgt. James back home in a grocery store aisle trying to decide which of 500 boxes of cereal to buy. I watched that thinking, ""Free Willy!""Also of note is the lack of blood and guts in the movie. They didn't need it to tell the story. There was some crude language, but, and I am not exaggerating, there was more of that in Trading Places, which I watched again recently. The acting was all top-notch and believable, made doubly so by some A-List cameos who get killed after 5 minutes on screen. I sat there thinking, ""But I liked him. I wanted to see more of him. He can't be dead."" As I pondered this later, I realized that perhaps that was the intended effect. Perhaps, and if so, then it was genius - this was a way to make the movie more personal.I also think it's worth spelling out that THE HURT LOCKER is not so much a war movie as it is a movie set in a war. The characters could have been firefighters or cops or any number of high-danger professionals, and the story would still have worked. Even so, I wouldn't change a thing. THE HURT LOCKER works just fine as it is.",4,An Old Tale With A New Twist,1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,3686,"['When', 'facing', 'tiger', 'run', 'hide', 'face', 'head', 'THE', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', 'tiger', 'ever-present', 'possibility', 'being', 'blown', 'bits', 'main', 'character', 'head', 'on.Set', 'Iraq', 'three', 'men', 'Bravo', 'Company', 'EOD', 'Explosive', 'Ordinance', 'Disposal', 'team', 'have', 'healthy', 'respect', 'roadside', 'bombs', 'taking', 'precautions', 'disaster', 'strikes', 'leaving', 'team', 'down', 'man', 'replacement', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'James', 'self-confident', 'veteran', 'Afghanistan', 'first', 'act', 'remove', 'protective', 'barrier', 'windows', 'barracks', 'sunlight', 'plywood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'protect', 'impact', 'ceiling', 'anyway', 'first', 'hint', 'world', 'view', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'different', 'other', 'members', 'EOD', 'first', 'mission', 'doubt', 'arrival', 'scene', 'improvised', 'explosive', 'device', 'IED', 'SSgt', 'James', 'use', 'remotely', 'controlled', 'robot', 'opting', 'instead', 'wear', 'suit', 'search', 'bomb', 'bomb', 'could', 'be', 'detonated', 'anytime', 'buildings', 'lining', 'street', 'SSgt', 'James', 'choice', 'go', 'foot', 'insane', 'especially', 'own', 'men', 'Everyone', 'including', 'audience', 'left', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'make', 'man', 'take', 'such', 'unnecessary', 'risks', 'SSgt', 'James', 'so', 'time', 'again', 'absolutely', 'surprise', 'when', 'close', 'movie', 'see', 'returning', 'Iraq', '365-day', 'tour', 'duty', 'simple', 'fact', 'work.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'write', 'review', 'several', 'days', 'seeing', 'THE', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', 'had', 'let', 'simmer', 'subconscious', 'while', 'filmmakers', 'wisely', 'chose', 'stay', 'away', 'political', 'statements', 'kind', 'subjective', 'commentary', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', '100', '%', 'believable', 'civilian', 'rate', 'seem', '100', '%', 'sane', 'context', 'own', 'actions', 'say', 'would', 'not', 'don', 'suit', 'march', 'up', 'IED', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'SSgt', 'James', 'willingness', 'nay', 'eagerness', 'do', 'so', 'more', 'insane', 'racing', 'driver', 'who', 'roar', 'track', 'more', '200mph', 'man', 'loved', 'work', 'focused', 'made', 'feel', 'alive', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'it.The', 'movie', 'also', 'reminded', 'classics', 'such', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'William', 'Wyler', 'movie', 'depicted', 'difficulties', 'returning', 'WWII', 'veterans', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'aspect', 'starkly', 'about', '3', 'minutes', 'scenes', 'most', 'jarring', 'pair', 'scenes', 'start', 'horrible', 'incident', 'Iraq', 'switch', 'almost', 'immediately', 'SSgt', 'James', 'back', 'home', 'grocery', 'store', 'aisle', 'trying', 'decide', '500', 'boxes', 'cereal', 'buy', 'watched', 'thinking', 'Free', 'Willy', 'Also', 'note', 'lack', 'blood', 'guts', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'tell', 'story', 'was', 'crude', 'language', 'am', 'not', 'exaggerating', 'was', 'more', 'Trading', 'Places', 'watched', 'again', 'recently', 'acting', 'was', 'top-notch', 'believable', 'made', 'doubly', 'so', 'A-List', 'cameos', 'who', 'get', 'killed', '5', 'minutes', 'screen', 'sat', 'thinking', 'liked', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'dead', 'pondered', 'later', 'realized', 'perhaps', 'was', 'intended', 'effect', 'Perhaps', 'so', 'then', 'was', 'genius', 'was', 'way', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'personal.I', 'also', 'think', 'worth', 'spelling', 'out', 'THE', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'war', 'movie', 'movie', 'set', 'war', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'firefighters', 'cops', 'number', 'high-danger', 'professionals', 'story', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'worked', 'Even', 'so', 'would', ""n't"", 'change', 'thing', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', 'just', 'fine']",N/A

You know were at war, but it doesn't focus on that aspect of it.  What it does very well is it focuses on one man's position during the war efforts.  He diffuses bombs.  This film was shot in a way that gives you a documentary feel as if its really happening.  This makes it all the more unsettling.  We follow the role of a bomb tech guy who straps on an 80lb suit in 100 degree weather in the desert.  He then goes to a location where a bomb has been discovered and he dangerously pulls the wires from it so it doesn't go off.  We watch with fearful anticipated anxiety as he carefully pulls each one out.  Onlookers by those that live in the area look on as these soldiers move into their territory in hummers with guns.  You don't know if the onlookers are good or bad and it's brilliantly captured.  This is a realistic portrait of the feeling of what it would be like if you were a soldier rolling in there or if you were living there and these guys were coming in.  Jeremy Renner plays the bomb tech guy and developed a three dimensional character with neurosis and faults.  His performance is incredible and it makes the movie all the more interesting.

Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge of Bravo Company are at the volatile center of the war, part of a small counterforce specifically trained to handle the homemade bombs, or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), that account for more than half of American hostile deaths and have killed thousands of Iraqis. A high-pressure, high-stakes assignment, the job leaves no room for mistakes, as they learn when they lose their team leader on a mission. When Staff Sergeant William James takes over the team, Sanborn and Eldridge are shocked by what seems like his reckless disregard for military protocol and basic safety measures. And yet, in the fog of war, appearances are never reliable for long. Is James really a swaggering cowboy who lives for peak experiences and the moments when the margin of error is zero - or is he a consummate professional who has honed his esoteric craft to high-wire precision? As the fiery chaos of Baghdad swirls around them, the men struggle to understand and contain their new leader long enough for them to make it home. They have only 38 days left in their tour of Iraq, but with each new mission comes another deadly encounter, and as James blurs the line between bravery and bravado, it seems only a matter of time before disaster will strike.The cast led by Jeremy Renner (in an Oscar-caliber performance as James) & Anthony Mackie (equally impressive as Sanborn) is excellent! The directing by Kathryn Bigelow (also produced) (who also wrote and directed ""Near Dark"" (1987), directed ""Point Break"" (1991) & ""Strange Days"" (1995) is brilliant!

The cinematography by Barry Ackroyd (who also did the cinematography to ""United 93"" (2006) & the upcoming ""Green Zone"" (2010), both which were directed by Paul Greengrass) is excellent! The film editing by Chris Innis & Bob Murawski (who also did the film editing to most of Sam Raimi's movies, recently including, ""Drag Me To Hell"" (2009) & the upcoming ""Spider-Man 4"" (2011) is excellent! The casting by Mark Bennett (who also did the casting to ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (2006) & its sequel (2007) is excellent!

The art direction by David Bryan is excellent! The set decoration by Amin Charif El Masri is excellent! The costume design by George L.

1252683,A356RFKNIG043B,B00275EGWY,K. Swanson,"[0, 0]","3.5 starsThe Hurt Locker might be a masterpiece for some, and seem realistic (if not to those who actually did this job in Iraq: see the low-starred reviews here). But it felt way too slow for me, and disconcertingly unwilling to address anything beyond the minutiae of each defusing event. I never really got much chance to care for any of the characters, though there was some nice ironic humor. Mostly I wanted to be involved beyond the obvious will-it-blow-up tension, yet rarely was.I sure couldn't wait to see it, and rented the blu-ray the day it came out. It looks good, and Bigelow has a nice eye. But somehow it all felt oddly prosaic. No doubt this is a brutal job, and it's an interesting topic for a film, yet I never felt like I had a chance to get to know anyone here enough to care much about them. Perhaps that's the point?I was interested by the comments on the one and two star reviews here, and on other boards. Apparently a lot of EOD experts find this film annoyingly innaccurate, while many film fans point to that as unimportant; ""film can take any liberty needed to tell its story"". Agreed, but this sort of film seems married to technical accuracy, indeed prides itself on it, and it felt strange to see so many lives risked, American and Iraqi, by hotshot tactics based on the need for a thrill. Is this what it's really like? Army guys risk each other's lives all the time just to cop a rush? The little speech about that was one of the few times this film really gripped me, much more than the many isn't-this-a-tense-moment scenes, which wore on far too long. They felt overdone and trite, in fact.One thing that others liked, THL's apparently opjective tone, felt off to me. Yes, this is how these guys do this job (or is it? The EOD reviewers giving this low stars say it ain't, and they might know best). But this job only occurs when we decide to send our troops to other countries, and some of the people there don't want us around. Examining the details of defusing bombs while ignoring the reasons for those bombs being made seems somehow dishonest in a way. You can't separate those details any more than you can separate a cow's role in a hamburger, and completely ignoring why we're in Iraq felt forced and fake in spite of all the attempts to make this seem real.Maybe that's why this movie is so beloved; it absolves the viewer from thinking about the subtle issues in Iraq, and focuses on the life or death moments, stripped of the entire context for their coming into being. It's much easier for us to see Iraq as a job for our soldiers than ask ourselves: if we really love these soldiers, why are we putting them in the line of death every day, and what have we gained from their sacrifices? Instead we get a film that makes all that seem extraneous.You're telling me these disposal guys never discuss the reasons for their being there? I don't buy that. I felt more for the innocent Iraqi strapped with a bomb than I did for the guys trying to defuse it. They volunteered for this, and are getting paid for their service; no one made them enlist---the draft is long gone. Whereas the Iraqi is just dying for no reason at all. So who's the hero? One of the basic points of a good war film is that it's not whose side you're on that makes you a good guy; it's whether you are a good person, apart from your country's motives. This was touched on to some degree here, but ignoring all the War On Terror context didn't make sense to me, and made this film feel contrived in many ways.The low-starred reviews here tend to be from military personnel, and their thoughts are very interesting to read.Perhaps I need to watch Hurt Locker again. But on first viewing it just didn't grip me the way it did most everyone else. I wish it had! Apocalypse Now and a number of other war films are among my favorite movies, and I was hoping this one would be too. But there's not one character here that I really cared about, one way or the other, compared to my feelings about those films. I appreciated Bigelow's craft, but it didn't move me as it did others. Doesn't mean it ain't a great movie, just that it ain't my idea of a great movie.",3,"This Best Movie 0f 2009 pick on everyone's list didn't grab me,",1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,4173,"['3.5', 'starsThe', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'might', 'be', 'masterpiece', 'seem', 'realistic', 'not', 'who', 'actually', 'did', 'job', 'Iraq', 'see', 'low-starred', 'reviews', 'here', 'felt', 'way', 'too', 'slow', 'disconcertingly', 'unwilling', 'address', 'anything', 'minutiae', 'defusing', 'event', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'much', 'chance', 'care', 'characters', 'was', 'nice', 'ironic', 'humor', 'Mostly', 'wanted', 'be', 'involved', 'obvious', 'will-it-blow-up', 'tension', 'yet', 'rarely', 'was.I', 'sure', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'rented', 'blu-ray', 'day', 'came', 'out', 'good', 'Bigelow', 'nice', 'eye', 'somehow', 'felt', 'oddly', 'prosaic', 'doubt', 'brutal', 'job', 'interesting', 'topic', 'film', 'yet', 'never', 'felt', 'had', 'chance', 'get', 'know', 'anyone', 'here', 'enough', 'care', 'much', 'Perhaps', 'point', 'was', 'interested', 'comments', 'one', 'two', 'star', 'reviews', 'here', 'other', 'boards', 'Apparently', 'lot', 'EOD', 'experts', 'find', 'film', 'annoyingly', 'innaccurate', 'many', 'film', 'fans', 'point', 'unimportant', 'film', 'can', 'take', 'liberty', 'needed', 'tell', 'story', 'Agreed', 'sort', 'film', 'married', 'technical', 'accuracy', 'indeed', 'felt', 'strange', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'risked', 'American', 'Iraqi', 'hotshot', 'tactics', 'based', 'need', 'thrill', 'what', 'really', 'like', 'Army', 'guys', 'risk', 'other', 'lives', 'time', 'just', 'cop', 'rush', 'little', 'speech', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'film', 'really', 'gripped', 'much', 'more', 'many', ""isn't-this-a-tense-moment"", 'scenes', 'wore', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'felt', 'overdone', 'trite', 'fact.One', 'thing', 'others', 'liked', 'THL', 'apparently', 'opjective', 'tone', 'felt', 'off', 'Yes', 'how', 'guys', 'do', 'job', 'EOD', 'reviewers', 'giving', 'low', 'stars', 'say', 'ai', ""n't"", 'might', 'know', 'best', 'job', 'only', 'when', 'decide', 'send', 'troops', 'other', 'countries', 'people', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'around', 'Examining', 'details', 'defusing', 'bombs', 'ignoring', 'reasons', 'bombs', 'being', 'made', 'somehow', 'dishonest', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'separate', 'details', 'more', 'can', 'separate', 'cow', 'role', 'hamburger', 'completely', 'ignoring', 'why', ""'re"", 'Iraq', 'felt', 'forced', 'fake', 'spite', 'attempts', 'make', 'seem', 'why', 'movie', 'so', 'beloved', 'viewer', 'thinking', 'subtle', 'issues', 'Iraq', 'life', 'death', 'moments', 'stripped', 'entire', 'context', 'coming', 'being', 'much', 'easier', 'see', 'Iraq', 'job', 'soldiers', 'ask', 'ourselves', 'really', 'love', 'soldiers', 'why', 'are', 'putting', 'line', 'death', 'day', 'have', 'gained', 'sacrifices', 'Instead', 'get', 'film', 'seem', 'extraneous.You', ""'re"", 'telling', 'disposal', 'guys', 'never', 'discuss', 'reasons', 'being', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'felt', 'more', 'innocent', 'Iraqi', 'strapped', 'bomb', 'did', 'guys', 'trying', 'defuse', 'volunteered', 'are', 'getting', 'paid', 'service', 'one', 'made', 'enlist', '-the', 'draft', 'long', 'gone', 'Iraqi', 'just', 'dying', 'reason', 'So', 'who', 'hero', 'One', 'basic', 'points', 'good', 'war', 'film', 'not', 'side', ""'re"", 'good', 'guy', 'are', 'good', 'person', 'apart', 'country', 'motives', 'was', 'touched', 'degree', 'here', 'ignoring', 'War', 'Terror', 'context', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'made', 'film', 'feel', 'contrived', 'many', 'ways.The', 'low-starred', 'reviews', 'here', 'tend', 'be', 'military', 'personnel', 'thoughts', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'read.Perhaps', 'need', 'watch', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'again', 'first', 'viewing', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'grip', 'way', 'did', 'most', 'everyone', 'else', 'wish', 'had', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'number', 'other', 'war', 'films', 'are', 'favorite', 'movies', 'was', 'hoping', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'not', 'one', 'character', 'here', 'really', 'cared', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'compared', 'feelings', 'films', 'appreciated', 'Bigelow', 'craft', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'did', 'others', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ai', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'idea', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

He's not a particularly good leading man, he's fantastic in Dominik's 2007 the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, so perhaps he should stick to side characters, or he's still honing his skills for a superb breakout performance. His character treats each mission like a cheap whore after having gone sexless for about a month; there's that over excitement at the beginning, the actual event, and then the afterwards where he seems completely detached from everything that happened.I won't go so far as to say that the film is apolitical, but as far as war movies go this is probably the closest a fictionalized account of events has gotten to *ahem* fair and balanced.There are some genuinely interesting moments, and some genuinely stupid ones; the good would be the first few bomb missions, the moments that made me roll my eyes was the shower scene, (really? one of those? ""oh no, I need to cleanse myself of the horror, weehhh.""), the specialist, while playing Gears of WAR (get it?) going on his little pissfit about ""now he's dead, now he's alive."" and the absolute worst moment of the film: the last few minutes.All I could think to myself at that point was: ""here we had an okay film nearly ruined by an ending that makes it seem like the directorial reigns were handed over to Michael Bay.""",2,"oh man, how did kate get off the island to go grocery shopping with dahmer?!?!?!",1278979200,"07 13, 2010",2010,1987,"['waited', 'time', 'hype', 'die', 'down', 'so', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'completely', 'clear', 'mind', 'not', 'analysis', 'film', 'weighed', 'down', 'too', 'heavily', 'reviews', 'comments', 'friends', 'just', 'seemed', 'right', 'path', 'take.She', 'versatile', 'director', 'say', 'least', 'Near', 'Dark', 'Strange', 'Days', 'Point', 'Break', 'now', 'multiple', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Hurt', 'Locker.Jeremy', 'Renner', 'dude', 'who', 'uber', 'addicted', 'rush', 'disarming', 'bombs', ""n't"", 'love', 'anything', 'normal', 'mundane', 'life', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'waste', 'time', 'trying', 'fix', 'unsolvable', 'problem', 'assbackwards', 'folk', 'middle', 'east', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'leading', 'man', 'fantastic', 'Dominik', '2007', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'so', 'perhaps', 'should', 'stick', 'side', 'characters', 'still', 'honing', 'skills', 'superb', 'breakout', 'performance', 'character', 'treats', 'mission', 'cheap', 'whore', 'having', 'gone', 'sexless', 'month', 'excitement', 'beginning', 'actual', 'event', 'then', 'afterwards', 'where', 'completely', 'detached', 'everything', 'happened.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'film', 'apolitical', 'as', 'far', 'war', 'movies', 'go', 'probably', 'closest', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'events', 'gotten', '*ahem*', 'fair', 'are', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'moments', 'genuinely', 'stupid', 'ones', 'good', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'few', 'bomb', 'missions', 'moments', 'made', 'roll', 'eyes', 'was', 'shower', 'scene', 'really', 'one', 'oh', 'need', 'cleanse', 'horror', 'weehhh', 'specialist', 'playing', 'Gears', 'WAR', 'get', 'going', 'little', 'pissfit', 'now', 'dead', 'now', 'alive', 'absolute', 'worst', 'moment', 'film', 'last', 'few', 'minutes.All', 'could', 'think', 'myself', 'point', 'was', 'here', 'had', 'okay', 'film', 'nearly', 'ruined', 'ending', 'directorial', 'reigns', 'were', 'handed', 'over', 'Michael', 'Bay']",N/A

Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[4, 5]","Set in the Iraq War, the movie is based on first hand observations of Mark Boal, who was embedded with a special bomb unit in Iraq.The story focuses on Staff Sergeant James, (Jeremy Remer) head of an elite squad of soldiers with a mission to protect and save by disarming bombs of all kinds.  It is not easy and the war zone is full of terrorists, assassins, suicide bombers homemade/improvised bombs.In 2004, Staff Sergent James takes over the squad after they lost their team leader on a mission.  When James takes over he does not follow the military rules and protocol.  He gets the job done and is recognized as ""wild"" by a superior who asks how many bombs he has disarmed.  The only part of the movie that did not ring true was when he said ""843 bombs disarmed""  - that did not seem realistic, when the margin of error is zero and the variety of bombs.  The bomb team has only 38 days left in their tour of Iraq and the count-down of days on the screen show situation after ungodly situation where their lives are a hair breath away from death.  The movie holds your attention with deep emotional intensity and action packed scene after scene.  We finally come to understand why Jeremy flirts with death - to feel alive.  A regular life is boring and unmeaning to him.The filming is realistic and it clearly shows the hot, dry, dreary, primitive conditions the soldiers deal with.  The rigors of fighting a half world away, far from the luxuries of home are clearly defined.

Will someone crack, will someone die?It's simply one of the most tense and gripping movies you'll see in this or any year.  I recall, feeling the heat heat of the desert, and the tense feeling as if I was there about to be blown up, and I recall leaving the theater thinking would win the Oscar for Best Movie and Best Director.  Then in December Avatar appeared.A curious coincidence of these two movies is that James Cameron, Avatar and Titanic director was once married to Kathryn Bigelow director of Hurt Locker.  As the Oscar nominations are due to be made this week, the stage is set for a compelling David and Goliath showdown.  The two big nominations are Best Director, and Best Movie, but also Best Original Screenplay.Although I loved Avatar, I would love to see Hurt Locker pick up at least one of these awards.  The most likely would be Best Screenplay.  Certainly the awards would mean more for Hurt Locker and Bigelow than for Avatar and Cameron, which has now surpassed Titanic's world record Box Office. I am all for Hurt Locker, and Bigelow. Can we split it?Update. 2/2/2010.  Hurt Locker has won 50 awards already, garnering widespread appreciation. It has now been nominated for 9 Academy Awards, including the ones I mentioned, Best Director, Best Pictture, Best Original Screenplay, and also Best Cinematography, and Best Editing.  Avatar also got nominated for 9 Academy Awards, and Inglourious Beasterds for 8, rounding out the leaders of the pack.March 11, 2010. I was as surprised as anyone when Hurt Locker won for both Best Picture, and Best Director.  In so doing Kathryn Bigelow has become the first woman to win for Best Director.

1252696,A1TWTULVD6F22O,B00275EGWY,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[11, 16]","The DVD:The Hurt LockerKatherine Bigelow  seems an unlikely choice for the directorial helm of Matt Boal's script for a war-themed independent film, ""The Hurt Locker"" (and the title's unlikely, too).  Boal was last seen penning ""In the Valley of Elah"" , in which he turned a laudable screenplay from a hauntingly true story he had written for Playboy.  I personally think that Boal was arm-wrestled into many of the aspects of the screenplay by powerful director and co-writer Paul Haggis during ""In the Valley"".  That, in fact, might be why Boal sought out someone who was more concerned about seeing the realism of the war in Iraq as it is, and not trying to politicize a story.  The story, simply, is one  of every day Americans confronted by the need to put their lives on the line in a country that is as hellish as the Iraq in 2004, in the wake of our great adventure there.Hand-held camera shoots in ""The Hurt Locker"" give the gritty, real appearance of Iraq in the film.  Bigelow shot in  Jordan, when she could not overcome obstacles to filming in Kuwait, and the camera scenes can make one weary, in 137 minutes of film, But most of the film is so gripping, and the scenes portrayed do have a tendency to make everyone involved weary, weary of the war.  Bigelow and Boal don't have to preach that war is hell, they just portray it in the realism of the film.  We get it.The story line involves a 3 person EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit, charged with finding and clearing explosive devices that seemingly litter the landscape in Iraq.  I've done some fiction and non-fiction reading about bomb techs in metropolitan areas in the US, and recognize that the specialty is populated with people who live their lives knowing that the next assignment could cost them those self-same lives.  Not a vocation for the weak at heart.  As the film begins, the trio in the EOD Hummer includes the bomb tech, Sgt. Thompson (Guy Pearce in a good cameo), the driver, Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie, largely unsung before this film),  and the Specialist, who acts as the lookout and the turret gun in the Hummer, Eldridge (Brian Geraghty).  The three work well together.In shocking and violent order, Thompson breathes his last, and is replaced with Staff Sgt James (Jeremy Renner who was cast as Dahmer early in his career in the film of the same name. Renner has kicked around film and TV since then - he appeared as a lead in ""The Unusuals"" in this TV season, opposite Amber Tamblyn.  It was not renewed.).  As James, Renner has turned in a performance so finally nuanced, that his name will no doubt come up at Oscar time.Sanborn and Eldridge don't know what to make of the new bomb tech, who is silent and somewhat reckless, a contrast to the confident Thompson, who was a team player.  Over the course of their time with him, you can sense the two of them swinging into his rhythm, learning to anticipate his quirky style and the aplomb with which he's handled 800 explosive devices.  Attribute this to the strong delivery Renner brings to the ""silent cowboy"" type.  The unit has only 39 days left on their tour.With Eldridge, and to a lesser degree, Sanborn, your sense is that they are waiting on the edges of their chairs for the tour to be over, so that they can escape with their lives and revisit the hellish assignment in dreams.  With James, you get the feel that the 39 days is not enough; that only when he is pursuing his special trade does he feel at one with the world.  There are sidelines to James' story; one in his relationship with a young Iraqi boy, and one in his inability to shoulder his homelife with wife and young son.Because of their vocation, and because of the reality of the fear in the Iraqi streets, the intensity in this film makes time pass swiftly, absorbs the viewer in the reality.  The actual bombs are stark in their violence, the feel of the streets is that of underlying deception.  There is a scene in the last half of the film where the unit encounters a group of contractors (cameos by Ralph Fiennes and David Morse), that potentially could have come out in editing, but it serves as a contrast of what the different dangers are when EOD units are exposed in the open desert, and not in the city streets.And ""the hurt locker"" of the title?  It stands for a collection kept by James of items found at the bomb scenes; items that immediately call each scene to mind in the collection of nightmares that he's grown addicted to.  And he is addicted; never doubt that.Realistic and timely, ""The Hurt Locker"" may be one of the best movies you can see this year.",5,"Forget Politics - ""The Hurt Locker"" is a film about the ugliness of war",1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,4602,"['DVD', 'Hurt', 'LockerKatherine', 'Bigelow', 'unlikely', 'choice', 'directorial', 'helm', 'Matt', 'Boal', 'script', 'war-themed', 'independent', 'film', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'title', 'unlikely', 'too', 'Boal', 'was', 'last', 'seen', 'penning', 'Valley', 'Elah', 'turned', 'laudable', 'screenplay', 'hauntingly', 'true', 'story', 'had', 'written', 'Playboy', 'personally', 'think', 'Boal', 'was', 'arm-wrestled', 'many', 'aspects', 'screenplay', 'powerful', 'director', 'co-writer', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Valley', 'fact', 'might', 'be', 'why', 'Boal', 'sought', 'out', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'more', 'concerned', 'seeing', 'realism', 'war', 'Iraq', 'not', 'trying', 'politicize', 'story', 'story', 'simply', 'one', 'day', 'Americans', 'confronted', 'need', 'put', 'lives', 'line', 'country', 'as', 'hellish', 'Iraq', '2004', 'wake', 'great', 'adventure', 'there.Hand-held', 'camera', 'shoots', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'give', 'gritty', 'real', 'appearance', 'Iraq', 'film', 'Bigelow', 'shot', 'Jordan', 'when', 'could', 'not', 'overcome', 'obstacles', 'filming', 'Kuwait', 'camera', 'scenes', 'can', 'make', 'one', 'weary', '137', 'minutes', 'film', 'most', 'film', 'so', 'gripping', 'scenes', 'portrayed', 'do', 'have', 'tendency', 'make', 'everyone', 'involved', 'weary', 'weary', 'war', 'Bigelow', 'Boal', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'preach', 'war', 'hell', 'just', 'portray', 'realism', 'film', 'get', 'it.The', 'story', 'line', '3', 'person', 'EOD', 'Explosive', 'Ordnance', 'Disposal', 'unit', 'charged', 'finding', 'clearing', 'explosive', 'devices', 'seemingly', 'litter', 'landscape', 'Iraq', ""'ve"", 'done', 'fiction', 'non-fiction', 'reading', 'bomb', 'techs', 'metropolitan', 'areas', 'US', 'recognize', 'specialty', 'populated', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'lives', 'knowing', 'next', 'assignment', 'could', 'cost', 'self-same', 'lives', 'Not', 'vocation', 'weak', 'heart', 'film', 'trio', 'EOD', 'Hummer', 'bomb', 'tech', 'Sgt', 'Thompson', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'good', 'cameo', 'driver', 'Sgt', 'Sanborn', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'largely', 'unsung', 'film', 'Specialist', 'who', 'lookout', 'turret', 'gun', 'Hummer', 'Eldridge', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'three', 'work', 'well', 'together.In', 'shocking', 'violent', 'order', 'Thompson', 'last', 'replaced', 'Staff', 'Sgt', 'James', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'who', 'was', 'cast', 'Dahmer', 'early', 'career', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'Renner', 'kicked', 'film', 'TV', 'then', 'appeared', 'lead', 'Unusuals', 'TV', 'season', 'opposite', 'Amber', 'Tamblyn', 'was', 'not', 'renewed.', 'James', 'Renner', 'turned', 'performance', 'so', 'finally', 'nuanced', 'name', 'will', 'doubt', 'come', 'up', 'Oscar', 'time.Sanborn', 'Eldridge', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'new', 'bomb', 'tech', 'who', 'silent', 'somewhat', 'reckless', 'contrast', 'confident', 'Thompson', 'who', 'was', 'team', 'player', 'course', 'time', 'can', 'sense', 'two', 'swinging', 'rhythm', 'learning', 'anticipate', 'quirky', 'style', 'aplomb', 'handled', '800', 'explosive', 'devices', 'Attribute', 'strong', 'delivery', 'Renner', 'silent', 'cowboy', 'type', 'unit', 'only', '39', 'days', 'left', 'tour.With', 'Eldridge', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Sanborn', 'sense', 'are', 'waiting', 'edges', 'chairs', 'tour', 'be', 'can', 'escape', 'lives', 'revisit', 'hellish', 'assignment', 'dreams', 'James', 'get', 'feel', '39', 'days', 'not', 'enough', 'only', 'when', 'pursuing', 'special', 'trade', 'feel', 'one', 'world', 'are', 'sidelines', 'James', 'story', 'one', 'relationship', 'young', 'Iraqi', 'boy', 'one', 'inability', 'shoulder', 'homelife', 'wife', 'young', 'son.Because', 'vocation', 'reality', 'fear', 'Iraqi', 'streets', 'intensity', 'film', 'time', 'pass', 'swiftly', 'viewer', 'reality', 'actual', 'bombs', 'are', 'stark', 'violence', 'feel', 'streets', 'underlying', 'deception', 'scene', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'where', 'unit', 'group', 'contractors', 'cameos', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'David', 'Morse', 'potentially', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'editing', 'contrast', 'what', 'different', 'dangers', 'are', 'when', 'EOD', 'units', 'are', 'exposed', 'open', 'desert', 'not', 'city', 'streets.And', 'hurt', 'locker', 'title', 'collection', 'kept', 'James', 'items', 'found', 'bomb', 'scenes', 'items', 'immediately', 'call', 'scene', 'mind', 'collection', 'nightmares', 'grown', 'addicted', 'addicted', 'never', 'doubt', 'that.Realistic', 'timely', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'can', 'see', 'year']",N/A

Critics love movies where nothing ever happens, or, as they will insist, ""the drama is beneath the surface"". Yes, a movie cannot truly achieve greatness unless 4 years of film school are required to ""grasp the subtleties"". We are spending 10 minutes of screen time staring at a sand hill in the desert not, as you may suspect, because the director couldn't think of anything else, but so that we can ""feel the tension"". Was the dialogue composed of random bits of conversation picked up by stray boom mikes? It may seem so to the average viewer, but a true movie buff will see the deep significance here. Trust me on this.2. It's about an extremely depressing subject that Hollywood knows nothing about. Voting for movies about war, genocide, poverty, and other things that they hear about on NPR allows Academy members to show us how ""tuned in"" and ""empathetic"" they are. Of course, when one spends all of one's time at awards galas, it's difficult to check the accuracy of such movies. No matter though, because everyone will be impressed by the amount of effort it took you to come to such complex conclusions as ""war is bad"" and ""genocide should be stopped"". (And yes, I am a liberal Democrat, but I am SO SICK of heavy-handed ""message movies"".)In an average year, a movie with only one of these shining characteristics might have a hope of winning. ""Avatar"" and ""Up in the Air"", for example, both beat viewers repeatedly over the head with their messages of ""environmentalism is good"" and ""the country is in recession"". Other critic's picks are excruciatingly boring.

That was brilliant. This is just how it feels when you come back after living in a foreign country! Also, a nice cameo by Kate from Lost. Also, what the heck is with that sniper scene where he takes out the guy as he is running. Maybe this is possible in Call of Duty, but I seriously doubt it in real life.

1252704,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00275EGWY,Mark Turner,"[2, 5]","I've grown accustomed to being disappointed in the wins for best picture at the Oscars over the last few years. It seems those who make the decisions are so dead set on being taken seriously as artists that they fail to choose films that are popular as well as artistic, going for the dramatic punch that they feel shows how serious they are. When you discount one aspect of a film in an attempt to look at another, you lose perspective of the whole meaning of the award. I always looked at the Oscar as rewarding the best and the brightest. It seems that stopped a few years back and continues to do so this year with THE HURT LOCKER.Don't get me wrong. The movie is a good look at the world our military goes through on a day to day basis in war torn countries, this one being Iraq. But with all the movies I saw this past year, this was not the one that I though came near being the best. And Kathryn Bigelow has long deserved notice in Hollywood. Her work in the past was ignored and the making of this film wasn't done by a major Hollywood studio. That shows how much they truly respect her. The nicest thing about it is that she will now have enough clout to get more of her movies off the ground.So the story. The film opens with a group of soldiers in an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit. Their job is to dismantle, disarm or explode any bombs that are found in the area they are stationed in. The weapons of choice they most often come into contact with are Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and they have one here. As they attempt to prevent the bomb from exploding, an insurgent with a cell phone explodes it, killing the group's leader.The film moves on to the new leader of the group, the new bomb expert Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner). Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), one of the remaining soldiers, welcomes James to Camp Victory which was Camp Liberty but they decided this sounded better. In his quarters, James has taken off the boards covering the windows to let light in. When Sanborn points out they were installed to keep mortar fire from coming through, James points out that the mortars could easily come in through the roof and he prefers the light. As the film progresses, this becomes a telling moment into the psychological state of mind of James.With only 38 days left of service, the team is sent out to do their job in the city. Completing the group is Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), also witness to the first death. As they arrive at locations throughout the film to disarm bombs, the cautious Sanborn and Eldridge are perplexed by James willingness to confront danger head on. His unwillingness to follow protocol or to listen to Sanborn leads to a confrontation as well as several hair raising sequences where they set out to save lives by taking the bombs out.The differences in these men are what make up the meat of the film. Sanborn wants to follow orders and wants to survive, yet he doesn't see that in James. Eldridge is the most apparently mentally disturbed of the trio, talking with the camp psychiatrist as he deals with the death that surrounds him. But it is James that is the most frightening of the group, living without fear of death, taking apart bombs as if there's nothing more thrilling to do, trying to find solutions to each one he comes across.James character is so in tune with his love of danger that he keeps a box of bomb parts and detonators under his bed. It is James' story that is the focus of the film. He has become so involved in his position that he seeks out danger, that adrenaline rush that comes with it. The problem is that at the same time he puts his men in harm's way as well.While the trio evolve into a sense of camaraderie, they also begin to come apart in thanks to James' need for the rush. With days counting down as the story moves forward, the tensions mount.Sound like a good movie? Well, it sort of is. But at the same time the tenseness of the situations these men find themselves in is played out in a semi-real time mode. The viewer is required to sit and painstakingly wait as the clock ticks by while bombs are taken out.While each actor and character are played well, the main focus on James by Renner is exceptional. A young actor just getting notice, Renner portrays a complex series of emotions in James, from the thrill junkie to the tender hearted man who weeps at the sight of a young boy he got to know who appears to be murdered with a bomb planted inside of him later on.The film confronts some tough issues concerning war and the world we face in Iraq. But the best thing that it does is not take a major stand on the issues. It doesn't go right or left politically but tells the tale of the men in uniform straight on.So why didn't I think it deserved the Oscar for best picture? Because it was long and drawn out, it moved at a snails pace and it didn't entertain me. Yes, it was well made (with the exception of the hand held jostling camera that seems to have become a favorite lately) and yes it told a compelling story. But I never felt involved, never invested in the characters enough to get into the film.I know, many people will take exception with my views as to this not being deserving of the award. But when did we decide that gritty, hard tempered films were the only ones deserving? When did films that contained hope become the black sheep? When did movies that made us laugh or sing suddenly become unworthy?I am a firm believer that most people go to movies to escape the world they live in, to get away from the moments of pain, poverty, anger and down right meanness they are exposed to daily. Those are the movies that inspire and give hope. They deserve to be rewarded. And yet Hollywood continues to choose message films instead. It is because of this that I can't say this movie deserves the award.As for a viewing, I'm not even sure I can recommend it for that either. It is tedious at worst and contains fine performances at best. The only way to choose viewing this is making the choice on your own, knowing inside what it is you expect from a film, what you want from one. I know I couldn't sit through this one again, not due to the content but due to the slowness of it.",3,OSCAR WORTHY?,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,6234,"[""'ve"", 'grown', 'accustomed', 'being',

The Hurt Locker pretty much is a movie that tries to be as close to reality as possible while still being a movie. The movie mainly focuses on the tasks of a bombsquad unit, and their ""unique"" replacement bombtech after the previous one is kia.The hurt locker doesn't ever go in to detail about the characters or who they are. Even the main character remains pretty much a mystery till the end. The acting is great, and the focal point of the story ""being an American soldier in Iraq"" is shown pretty well for what the movie is. I know there has been post after post about how this movie doesn't exactly mirror military protocal etc etc. but look... I never heard a Vietnam vet complain about Apocolypse now, Plantoon, or Full metal jacket... you dont see WWII veterans complaining about Saving private Ryan. So what if it's not line for line... this is a ""movie"" so please keep that in mind.There's a lot of good action in the film, but it's predictable. The movie has the habbit of going into ""widescreen"" whenever something is about to happen. Also the movie isn't ""gory"" it's more dramatized violence than what you would actually see. Like if a soldier was blown up you'd see his helmet roll by, or if someone got shot you would just see their body fall. Not much blood to be shown in this war movie so it's more or less about the dialogue.Since the characters pretty much remain a mystery to you there's not really anyone to root for. Watching the Hurt locker kind of felt like catching a good movie half way before it ends. It's good and you enjoy it, but you missed the first part of it that explained all the detail of what's going on. That is why I rated the film a 3/5.

1252707,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B00275EGWY,maskirovka,"[104, 140]","I wonder what sort of review I would have given ""the Hurt Locker"" had I not spent 11 years in the Army (about half active duty and the other half reserve and the Guard).  I probably would have liked it a lot, but my military experience (which predates the Iraq War but did involve Yugoslavia, Saudi Arabia and Iraq in 1990 and 1991, and Panama in 1989 made the departures from realism (that were invisible to a lot of reviewers here) stand out like blinking neon signs:1.  I thought the idea of the ""cowboy"" EOD technician sneaking out of the base to go on his own into downtown Baghdad at night in 2004 was laughable, when you think about the fact that I'm sure every soldier over there knows that if they fell into enemy hands, they could expect extremely unpleasant deaths.2.  Set aside the unrealism in item 1, the fact that the cowboy didn't get in trouble for doing something so outrageously stupid and criminal (since he did force an Iraqi at gunpoint to take him downtown) was also ludicrous.3.  I will defer to soldiers and Marines who have served over there and especially to EOD technicians, but I found myself extremely dubious that those guys would be out by themselves in such a dangerous environment.  No, they would have had security with them in the form of infantry who would keep watch and protect them while they did their work.4.  The absence of officers apart from one who gushes about the bravery of the cowboy EOD tech and the psychiatrist who gets himself blown up was unrealistic too.  Those guys would have answered to a captain or a lieutenant, or a warrant officer in real life.5.  The whole interlude where they were out in the desert with some British mercenaries (or at least that's what I thought they were) was a jarring disconnect given the fact that these guys were EOD techs and not special forces operators.  The fact that they were out there by themselves for a prolonged period made no sense since in real life, they would have been yelling on the radio for a quick reaction force or even support from a helicopter.6.  I also found myself thinking, ""this is BS"" when the two EOD technicians suddenly became a highly effective sniper team operating a weapon that I would imagine very few service personnel who aren't trained and designated snipers or SF operators would ever see (a Barrett .50 caliber rifle)""The Hurt Locker"" has some beautiful and striking visuals and there are some scenes with genuine tension like when the cowboy EOD tech discovers that the single IED he's found is only the first stage in a multiple IED set up...but as I said in my review title, these moments of genuine, realistic excitement got overwhelmed by the silly stuff.Frankly, if you want to see bomb disposal work that looks more realistic to my eyes at least, you should try renting or buying the British series ""Danger UXB.""  That seemed far more realistic than ""the Hurt Locker""DANGER UXBUpdate:  According to someone who works EOD who made a comment below, EOD teams sometimes use Barrett rifles to blow up devices, so the two guys playing sniper wasn't quite as silly as I thought it was ... but the overall interlude of them out there with the British mercs remained very silly in my view.",2,Good parts undermined by the bad,1263254400,"01 12, 2010",2010,3218,"['wonder', 'what', 'sort', 'review', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'had', 'not', 'spent', '11', 'years', 'Army', 'active', 'duty', 'other', 'half', 'reserve', 'Guard', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'lot', 'military', 'experience', 'Iraq', 'War', 'did', 'involve', 'Yugoslavia', 'Saudi', 'Arabia', 'Iraq', '1990', '1991', 'Panama', '1989', 'made', 'departures', 'realism', 'were', 'invisible', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'here', 'stand', 'out', 'blinking', 'neon', 'signs:1', 'thought', 'idea', 'cowboy', 'EOD', 'technician', 'sneaking', 'base', 'go', 'own', 'downtown', 'Baghdad', 'night', '2004', 'was', 'laughable', 'when', 'think', 'fact', ""'m"", 'sure', 'soldier', 'there', 'fell', 'enemy', 'hands', 'could', 'expect', 'extremely', 'unpleasant', 'deaths.2', 'Set', 'unrealism', 'item', '1', 'fact', 'cowboy', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'trouble', 'doing', 'something', 'so', 'outrageously', 'stupid', 'criminal', 'did', 'force', 'Iraqi', 'gunpoint', 'take', 'downtown', 'was', 'also', 'ludicrous.3', 'will', 'defer', 'soldiers', 'Marines', 'who', 'have', 'served', 'there', 'especially', 'EOD', 'technicians', 'found', 'extremely', 'dubious', 'guys', 'would', 'be', 'out', 'dangerous', 'environment', 'No', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'security', 'form', 'infantry', 'who', 'would', 'keep', 'watch', 'protect', 'did', 'work.4', 'absence', 'officers', 'apart', 'one', 'who', 'bravery', 'cowboy', 'EOD', 'tech', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'blown', 'up', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'too', 'guys', 'would', 'have', 'answered', 'captain', 'lieutenant', 'warrant', 'officer', 'real', 'life.5', 'whole', 'interlude', 'where', 'were', 'out', 'desert', 'British', 'mercenaries', 'least', 'what', 'thought', 'were', 'was', 'jarring', 'disconnect', 'given', 'fact', 'guys', 'were', 'EOD', 'techs', 'not', 'special', 'forces', 'operators', 'fact', 'were', 'out', 'there', 'prolonged', 'period', 'made', 'sense', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'yelling', 'radio', 'quick', 'reaction', 'force', 'even', 'support', 'helicopter.6', 'also', 'found', 'thinking', 'BS', 'when', 'two', 'EOD', 'technicians', 'suddenly', 'became', 'highly', 'effective', 'sniper', 'team', 'operating', 'weapon', 'would', 'imagine', 'very', 'few', 'service', 'personnel', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'trained', 'designated', 'snipers', 'SF', 'operators', 'would', 'ever', 'see', 'Barrett', '.50', 'caliber', 'rifle', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'beautiful', 'striking', 'visuals', 'are', 'scenes', 'genuine', 'tension', 'when', 'cowboy', 'EOD', 'tech', 'discovers', 'single', 'IED', 'found', 'only', 'first', 'stage', 'multiple', 'IED', 'set', 'up', 'said', 'review', 'title', 'moments', 'genuine', 'realistic', 'excitement', 'got', 'overwhelmed', 'silly', 'stuff.Frankly', 'want', 'see', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'work', 'more', 'realistic', 'eyes', 'least', 'should', 'try', 'renting', 'buying', 'British', 'series', 'Danger', 'UXB', 'seemed', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'DANGER', 'UXBUpdate', 'According', 'someone', 'who', 'EOD', 'who', 'made', 'comment', 'EOD', 'teams', 'sometimes', 'use', 'Barrett', 'rifles', 'blow', 'up', 'devices', 'two', 'guys', 'playing', 'sniper', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'silly', 'thought', 'was', 'overall', 'interlude', 'there', 'British', 'mercs', 'remained', 'very', 'silly', 'view']",N/A

I. Jane when Demi Moore's character is questioned about her motivations to continue struggle through SEAL training and she responds by asking how males in the program answer the same question, with the answer being ""Cause I get to blow (expletive, naturally) up.""  In this movie, Jeremy Renner in the role of Sgt. William James antes up by placing his very existence into the mix. In fact his portrayal is so intense and the movie itself so engrossing that I really didn't get the title until I sat down to write this review.This is a movie where one of those perfunctory reviews I detest stating something like ""It's fantastic, just go see it,"" take on heightened significance because I am convinced forays at analysis suffused with superlatives and accolades are paradoxically a disservice to anyone who might find the film appealing.  That said, if it is action, suspense and examination of the human condition that compels one to the theater, it is a film not to be missed regardless of the challenges of finding a screen featuring this lightly publicized, under distributed gem.If you liked Hamburger Hill or Blackhawk Down, you will be captivated by The Hurt Locker. It is a film with an agenda but unlike other film depictions of the Iraqi conflict it is about the military personnel mired in the conflagration, politicized perceptions and issues of justification are left for others to debate. There are a few marquee and above the title names but their extremely limited contributions are supplemental to the exemplary performances of the three major characters, portrayed by Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty and as previously noted, Jeremy Renner.  From the opening sequence, director Kathryn Bigelow puts the viewer in the roller coast money seats and doesn't let up on the throttle for next two hours.  Utilizing single camera technique, she puts you in the line of fire enduring environmental stresses in the face of sniper attack, inside an under- armored Humvee traveling across IED mined streets or peering out the mask of a bomb disposal technician's inadequately protective helmet, hoping to survive to the day military command has advised you are entitled breath regularly again, if your autonomic systems still remember.Are there stereotypical presentations, story arcs you've seen often enough to know the outcome from the instance of recognition, of course. Yet, with the intensity of scenes and poignancy of message, the visceral reaction tells you those deficiencies or flaws are of little consequence.

1252711,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00275EGWY,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[3, 6]","The Hurt Locker is a very well executed film about an aspect of the war in Iraq we don't think of often: the experiences of the troops assigned to deactivate bombs so that they cannot ever cause damage. The acting is easily some of the best I've ever seen; and along with that hand-held camera style of photography I genuinely felt as if I were watching a documentary about real people instead of a film with Hollywood actors in it. In addition, the choreography works wonders for the film; the script was well written and the casting was superbly done.It isn't long before we meet three soldiers who take on the task of deactivating bombs: Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner), who gets a drug-like thrill from being the one to go in and deactivate bombs even when he doesn't have to and his two backup men Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and the somewhat troubled Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) who talks to the company shrink but doesn't ever get comfortable with the war the way William James does.I could say so much about this movie, including what James' ""hurt locker"" represents but then I would be giving too much away. Suffice it to say that the movie is essentially a series of sequences that show the difficulties and the life-or-death stakes the troops face as portrayed by the characters James, Sanborn and Eldridge. There's plenty of action, tension and thriller aspects that add to the overall quality of the film; and the cameos we get from greats like Ralph Fiennes are wonderful. Look also for well done cameos by Evangeline Lilly as Connie James and Guy Pearce as Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson. Christopher Sayegh does an excellent job of playing the role of Beckham, a young boy who gets caught up with William James as the film progresses.If the film has any flaw, I would say that they could have edited down just a bit of the war footage and added just a few minutes more to the scenes in which Williams James is a civilian.In addition, the DVD comes with a ""behind the scenes"" featurette and an optional running commentary.The Hurt Locker will forever be one of the great movies about the modern day war in Iraq. I highly recommend this film for people interested in this subject; and people who enjoy thrillers, action movies and even dramas would do well to add this to their collections.",4,+ 1/2 star  WOW,1271376000,"04 16, 2010",2010,2344,"['Hurt', 'Locker', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'film', 'aspect', 'war', 'Iraq', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'often', 'experiences', 'troops', 'assigned', 'deactivate', 'bombs', 'can', 'not', 'ever', 'cause', 'damage', 'acting', 'easily', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'style', 'photography', 'genuinely', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'documentary', 'real', 'people', 'instead', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'addition', 'choreography', 'wonders', 'film', 'script', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'casting', 'was', 'superbly', 'done.It', ""n't"", 'long', 'meet', 'three', 'soldiers', 'who', 'take', 'task', 'deactivating', 'bombs', 'Sergeant', 'First', 'Class', 'William', 'James', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'who', 'drug-like', 'thrill', 'being', 'one', 'go', 'deactivate', 'bombs', 'even', 'when', ""n't"", 'have', 'two', 'backup', 'men', 'Sergeant', 'JT', 'Sanborn', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'somewhat', 'troubled', 'Specialist', 'Owen', 'Eldridge', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'who', 'company', 'shrink', ""n't"", 'ever', 'get', 'comfortable', 'war', 'way', 'William', 'James', 'does.I', 'could', 'say', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'including', 'what', 'James', 'hurt', 'locker', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'Suffice', 'say', 'movie', 'essentially', 'series', 'sequences', 'show', 'difficulties', 'life-or-death', 'stakes', 'troops', 'face', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'James', 'Sanborn', 'Eldridge', 'plenty', 'action', 'tension', 'thriller', 'aspects', 'add', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'cameos', 'get', 'greats', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Look', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'cameos', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'Connie', 'James', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Matt', 'Thompson', 'Christopher', 'Sayegh', 'excellent', 'job', 'playing', 'role', 'Beckham', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'caught', 'up', 'William', 'James', 'film', 'progresses.If', 'film', 'flaw', 'would', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'edited', 'down', 'just', 'bit', 'war', 'footage', 'added', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'more', 'scenes', 'Williams', 'James', 'civilian.In', 'addition', 'DVD', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'optional', 'running', 'commentary.The', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'will', 'forever', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'movies', 'modern', 'day', 'war', 'Iraq', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'interested', 'subject', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'thrillers', 'action', 'movies', 'even', 'dramas', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'add', 'collections']",N/A

1252721,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B00275EGWY,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[3, 5]","Watching The Hurt Locker and The Kingdom in succession provides an interesting perspective on the politics of East meets West and the American men and women we send there to make a difference.Sergeant First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) is new team leader in Bravo company of a U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit in 2004 Iraq.  He is a replacement for Staff Sergeant Thompson (Guy Pearce), who died from an IED in Baghdad. The other two member sof the team are James' guards who act as lookouts to prevent a follow-up ambush during bomb disposal, Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty). This is the story of an elite specialist, not a grunt who took on military service because he was looking to prove himself.  The Hurt Locker asks: what kind of person becomes an expert at the most dangerous job in the world?Sanborn and Eldridge count the days before their time is up - when they return home to their families, or when a sniper's bullet finally kills them.  Eldridge is nervous, jumpy, and on a slippery slope.  Sanborn is the consummate professional who goes by the book, but in a war torn land where few rules apply, James' flagrant disregard for safety rattles him.  Both men are convinced that James will be the death of them.And they're right.  James is good at what he does because he defines his universe from within.  James decides to befriend a young boy he nicknames Beckham (Christopher Sayegh) because he reminds James of his son. When James discovers a child victim of terror, James decides - with no evidence whatsoever - that it's Beckham.  It doesn't matter if the child is actually alive or dead.  James' boundaries are constructed in his own mind, because the forces he work with are entirely unpredictable.  Calmly detached from his own reality, James decides the bombs won't go off because they haven't yet, that he will live because he's survived so far. In a fickle, cruel world, James' self-centeredness borders on sociopathy, but it's exactly the kind of mindset he needs to be so good at facing down death every day.The problem is that supreme selfishness is not a trait that the military values.  What makes James an excellent bomb disposal expert makes him a terrible soldier in the field, and he nearly gets his team members killed in a misguided mission of revenge.The Hurt Locker culminates in a standoff over a Iraqi civilian with a bomb strapped to his chest. The experience convinces Sanborn to return home and settle down, but it never penetrates the inward-looking sphere that is James' ego.What makes the Hurt Locker so good is how it tells a story inward-out instead of outward-in. This is James' story first and foremost; everyone else, from his teammates to civilians to his own family, are just characters in his orbit.  And yet all those characters feel real. The Hurt Locker may be James' story, but it tells the plight of soldiers everywhere through sand, tears, sweat, and blood.",5,"Sand, tears, sweat, and blood",1296864000,"02 5, 2011",2011,2992,"['Watching', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Kingdom', 'succession', 'interesting', 'perspective', 'politics', 'East', 'meets', 'West', 'American', 'men', 'women', 'send', 'there', 'make', 'difference.Sergeant', 'First', 'Class', 'William', 'James', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'new', 'team', 'leader', 'Bravo', 'company', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'Explosive', 'Ordnance', 'Disposal', 'EOD', 'unit', '2004', 'Iraq', 'replacement', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'Thompson', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'who', 'died', 'IED', 'Baghdad', 'other', 'two', 'member', 'sof', 'team', 'are', 'James', 'guards', 'who', 'act', 'lookouts', 'prevent', 'follow-up', 'ambush', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'Sergeant', 'J.T', 'Sanborn', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Specialist', 'Owen', 'Eldridge', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'story', 'elite', 'specialist', 'not', 'grunt', 'who', 'took', 'military', 'service', 'was', 'looking', 'prove', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'expert', 'most', 'dangerous', 'job', 'world', 'Sanborn', 'Eldridge', 'count', 'days', 'time', 'up', 'when', 'return', 'home', 'families', 'when', 'sniper', 'bullet', 'finally', 'Eldridge', 'nervous', 'jumpy', 'slippery', 'slope', 'Sanborn', 'consummate', 'professional', 'who', 'book', 'war', 'torn', 'land', 'where', 'few', 'rules', 'apply', 'James', 'flagrant', 'disregard', 'safety', 'rattles', 'men', 'are', 'convinced', 'James', 'will', 'be', 'death', 'them.And', ""'re"", 'right', 'James', 'good', 'what', 'universe', 'James', 'befriend', 'young', 'boy', 'Beckham', 'Christopher', 'Sayegh', 'James', 'son', 'When', 'James', 'child', 'victim', 'terror', 'James', 'evidence', 'whatsoever', 'Beckham', ""n't"", 'matter', 'child', 'actually', 'alive', 'dead', 'James', 'boundaries', 'are', 'constructed', 'own', 'mind', 'forces', 'work', 'are', 'entirely', 'unpredictable', 'Calmly', 'detached', 'own', 'reality', 'James', 'bombs', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'off', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'will', 'live', 'survived', 'so', 'far', 'fickle', 'cruel', 'world', 'James', 'self-centeredness', 'borders', 'sociopathy', 'exactly', 'kind', 'mindset', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'facing', 'down', 'death', 'day.The', 'problem', 'supreme', 'selfishness', 'not', 'trait', 'military', 'values', 'What', 'James', 'excellent', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'expert', 'terrible', 'soldier', 'field', 'nearly', 'team', 'members', 'killed', 'misguided', 'mission', 'revenge.The', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'standoff', 'Iraqi', 'civilian', 'bomb', 'strapped', 'chest', 'experience', 'convinces', 'Sanborn', 'return', 'home', 'settle', 'down', 'never', 'inward-looking', 'sphere', 'James', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'so', 'good', 'how', 'story', 'inward-out', 'instead', 'outward-in', 'James', 'story', 'first', 'foremost', 'everyone', 'else', 'teammates', 'civilians', 'own', 'family', 'are', 'just', 'characters', 'orbit', 'yet', 'characters', 'feel', 'real', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'may', 'be', 'James', 'story', 'plight', 'soldiers', 'everywhere', 'sand', 'tears', 'sweat', 'blood']",N/A

1252727,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00275EGWY,mirasreviews,"[3, 4]","Journalist Mark Boal was imbedded with explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) technicians, AKA a bomb squad, in Iraq in 2004, where he observed the stresses and perils of Iraq War at its most bloody. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are the defining characteristic of the Iraq War, and that was during their peak, when EOD units saw a lot of action. Director Kathryn Bigelow asked Boal to write a fictional script based on his observations. ""The Hurt Locker"" follows a three-man EOD unit called Bravo Company for the last five weeks of its rotation in Iraq. The team's leader is the new guy, a brazen but highly skilled adrenaline junkie, SSG Will James (Jeremy Renner). He clashes with the professional, even-tempered Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), while the younger Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) has a hard time coping with the death around him.""The Hurt Locker"" was shot in a documentary style, always using four cameras with different views on the action, so the 44-day shoot in Jordan produced a million feet of film. Don't worry. It's all edited down quite nicely. The downside is that there is camera shake, a style that seems to have taken over contemporary cinema. The advantage is that Barry Ackroyd's cinematography and Kathryn Bigelow's direction bring out the drama inherent in the high-stress, do-or-die situations without seeming to try. Their approach to the material is almost prosaic. This is a day in the life of the bomb squad. And then another day, etc. It is always suspenseful, because diffusing bombs is inherently suspenseful. It is always dramatic, because these men must cope with extreme circumstances, and they do so differently, which can make them uneasy with one another.Bigelow cast the lead roles with actors who would not be immediately recognizable. We don't have any particular expectations of them, which augments the film's sense of immediacy. We don't' know ahead of time how anyone is going to react to the constantly shifting emotional landscape. But we get a few surprises when more recognizable actors show up in smaller roles. It's a nice touch. And the cast is terrific. Though there is plenty of action (and realistic explosions, not the kind that make pretty orange plumes), ""The Hurt Locker"" is very much a character drama. Three people react to war as they see it and to each other. It's not a political film. It doesn't comment on the wisdom, or not, of the Iraq War. It doesn't tell the audience who to see as hero, villain, or victim. But ""The Hurt Locker"" does give the impression that this is the reality of 21st century warfare.The DVD (Summit 2010): Bonus features are a making-of documentary, image gallery with audio, and a feature commentary. ""The Hurt Locker: Behind the Scenes"" (12 min) interviews Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, cast, and some creative crew about the films genesis, characters, the director's style, and the cinematography. The ""Image Gallery"" is a slideshow of behind-the-scenes photos with audio from a Q&A; with Bigelow and Boal at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London. So it gives us something to look at while we listen to the Q&A.; The audio commentary, again with director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal, is informative and constant. They discuss the locations, cast, filming in Jordan, the explosions, and Boal contributes some observations from his time in Iraq. Subtitles available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.

She doesn't shy from a theme - that war can be like a drug, both in its intensity and exhilaration and in the devastation of its effects.  At the same time she doesn't preach.  She tells a compelling story of a group of men who are tasked with one of the most critical and dangerous missions in Iraq, whose story has rarely been told and never this effectively: the bomb disposal units, whose job it is to find and defuse dangerous explosives under highly chaotic circumstances.While scenes of action are shot with a dynamic, documentary-style camera, the technique is not overused in this film.  Bigelow knows when to slow down and focus, and achieves a balance between storytelling and action, with a special focus on the kinds of relationships men build in times of war.  Bigelow is not afraid to let central characters die unexpectedly, and the film leads in some very unpredictable directions, that are for the most part plausible (with a few loose ends).

Durham ""Big Evil""","[0, 3]","Critically hailed since its theatrical release, The Hurt Locker in all honestly would not have attracted much attention from me were it not for the fact that it is directed by Kathryn Bigelow, the critically underrated filmmaker who crafted a genre classic with Near Dark, a guilty pleasure action flick with Point Break, and an underrated opus with Strange Days just to name a few.  This time around, Bigelow gives the viewer an inside view of the Iraq war with The Hurt Locker, which details the inner-workings of an Army bomb squad EOD unit, led by the newly transfered Sgt. Will James (Jeremy Renner) and rounded out by Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Eldridge (Brian Geraghty).  What could easily fall under the category of being ""another war movie"" is something that The Hurt Locker is certainly not, as Bigelow puts to use so many great moments of action, suspense, tension, and jaw dropping moments that you cannot help but admire the total package that the film winds up becoming.  Added to that are the performances from all the actors involved, with Renner in particular as the reckless, daredevil, freewheeling adrenaline-junkie soldier whose humanity manages to shine through; this is truly a star-making performance for the actor indeed.  There's cameo roles from Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, Evangeline Lilly, and David Morse as well; rounding out a surprisingly solid cast, but it's Mackie and definitely Renner that steal the show.  All in all, The Hurt Locker is by and far the finest war-related film to see the light of day in some time, and regardless of how you may feel about this particular film genre, missing this film is truly missing out on something special.

Technical precision isn't always involved in that decision, but cultural significance is, and I believe Hurt Locker stands as one of them.Director Bigelow depicts James, a reckless bomb specialist who chooses to be in danger by his own accord, often defusing explosives under gunfire. He's obsessed with his work. He wants to feel what the bomb maker feels, which is almost ironic considering that the designer may be standing idly by waiting to detonate it. For him, war is a drug.What we have in Locker is an experience as old as civilization itself. This time it's given a twenty-first century facelift with a terrorist enemy that prefers pointless chaos over established order. Still, an entire generation of 9-11 adults signed up for it. That's the focus, I believe, of the film, the generation, not your view on President Bush's war. Locker dissects millennials with focused intensity.

1252754,A1ZNGD2TMQY7HQ,B00275EGWY,Pato Cree,"[2, 5]","It's been awhile since I last saw this movie so I'll remember the best that I can during this review. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) I won't say that THE HURT LOCKER is a terrible film, but Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay of 2009? Give me a break. If this was directed by a man instead of a woman, it wouldn't have been NEARLY as successful as it was. The one thing people keep praising about this movie is how realistic it is. I must be missing something here because I did not for one second believe anything that was happening onscreen. A lot of it has to do with that God-forsaken shaky cam technique that tries to make the movie seem like a documentary but just gives me a headache. Here's a crazy idea: if you're going to shoot it like a documentary, why not MAKE A DOCUMENTARY?! I'm sure it'd be better than this! The other thing that really bothers me is that I never felt like the filmmakers actually understood anything about what it's like serving as a US soldier in Iraq, aside from the battles. Everyone acts and talks in a contrived, Hollywoodesque manner. One line in particular makes me cringe. It's the scene where Jeremy Renner's character (Sgt. James) is about to defuse a bomb, but he starts to take off his protective gear that shields him from the explosion. One of his colleagues asks him, ""What are you doing?"" Sgt. James replies: ""If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die comfortably."" Did I accidentally put Die Hard into the DVD player? Oh no, it's a movie about DEFUSING BOMBS IN IRAQ! Or how about the scene where James talks about things that almost killed him? ""That's my wedding ring. Like I said, things that almost killed me."" Bleh. Little moments like that really add up in the long run.Despite all of that, I think THE HURT LOCKER does have a fascinating premise: War is a drug. That's something I haven't seen in a movie, a war movie no less, but there's not a lot of interest to really explore this idea. Sgt. James just acts like a wannabe 80s action star most of the time, and the plot is all over the place. It's just this happens and this happens and this happens for 2 hours. I wouldn't mind except that these sequences of events don't add to the overall idea of the movie. They simply happen and then vanish without actually affecting the story. I guess you could argue that it was just trying to show what life was like in Iraq, but Iraq War veterans have already dismissed this movie as inaccurate Hollywood trite. So what's the point? The only thing that was interesting was at the end when Sgt. James is sent back home, gets sick of his routine civilian life, and returns back to Iraq. That's where the movie should have started because at least everything that would happen would somehow relate to the idea of ""War is a drug.""This could have been something meaningful and substantial, but THE HURT LOCKER just settles for mediocre. I really want to like this movie because again it's a great idea. I feel like the movie is getting at something that I simply can't see because I'm probably too stubborn. Well, until I can see what it's going for, I still give this 2/5 stars.PS: If you want a great movie about the War in Iraq, check out THE MESSENGER. That should have earned THE HURT LOCKER's recognition and accolades.",2,Interesting concept but that's it.,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,3275,"['been', 'awhile', 'last', 'saw', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'best', 'can', 'review', 'POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', 'terrible', 'film', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Original', 'Screenplay', '2009', 'Give', 'break', 'was', 'directed', 'man', 'instead', 'woman', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'NEARLY', 'as', 'successful', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'people', 'keep', 'praising', 'movie', 'how', 'realistic', 'must', 'be', 'missing', 'something', 'here', 'did', 'not', 'one', 'second', 'believe', 'anything', 'was', 'happening', 'onscreen', 'lot', 'do', 'God-forsaken', 'shaky', 'cam', 'technique', 'make', 'movie', 'seem', 'documentary', 'just', 'headache', 'Here', 'crazy', 'idea', ""'re"", 'going', 'shoot', 'documentary', 'why', 'not', 'MAKE', 'DOCUMENTARY', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'other', 'thing', 'really', 'bothers', 'never', 'felt', 'filmmakers', 'actually', 'understood', 'anything', 'what', 'like', 'serving', 'US', 'soldier', 'Iraq', 'aside', 'battles', 'Everyone', 'acts', 'talks', 'contrived', 'Hollywoodesque', 'manner', 'One', 'line', 'particular', 'cringe', 'scene', 'where', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'character', 'Sgt', 'James', 'defuse', 'bomb', 'take', 'off', 'protective', 'gear', 'explosion', 'One', 'colleagues', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'Sgt', 'James', ""'m"", 'gon', 'die', ""'m"", 'gon', 'die', 'comfortably', 'Did', 'accidentally', 'put', 'Die', 'Hard', 'DVD', 'player', 'Oh', 'movie', 'DEFUSING', 'BOMBS', 'IN', 'IRAQ', 'how', 'scene', 'where', 'James', 'things', 'almost', 'killed', 'wedding', 'ring', 'said', 'things', 'almost', 'killed', 'Bleh', 'Little', 'moments', 'really', 'add', 'up', 'long', 'run.Despite', 'think', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', 'have', 'fascinating', 'premise', 'War', 'drug', 'something', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'war', 'movie', 'less', 'not', 'lot', 'interest', 'really', 'explore', 'idea', 'Sgt', 'James', 'just', 'wannabe', '80s', 'action', 'star', 'most', 'time', 'plot', 'place', 'just', '2', 'hours', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sequences', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'overall', 'idea', 'movie', 'simply', 'happen', 'then', 'vanish', 'actually', 'affecting', 'story', 'guess', 'could', 'argue', 'was', 'just', 'trying', 'show', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'Iraq', 'Iraq', 'War', 'veterans', 'have', 'already', 'dismissed', 'movie', 'inaccurate', 'Hollywood', 'trite', 'what', 'point', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'end', 'when', 'Sgt', 'James', 'sent', 'back', 'home', 'sick', 'routine', 'civilian', 'life', 'back', 'Iraq', 'where', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'started', 'because', 'least', 'everything', 'would', 'happen', 'would', 'somehow', 'relate', 'idea', 'War', 'drug', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'something', 'meaningful', 'substantial', 'THE', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', 'just', 'mediocre', 'really', 'want', 'like', 'movie', 'again', 'great', 'idea', 'feel', 'movie', 'getting', 'something', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', ""'m"", 'probably', 'too', 'stubborn', 'Well', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'still', 'give', '2/5', 'stars.PS', 'want', 'great', 'movie', 'War', 'Iraq', 'check', 'out', 'THE', 'MESSENGER', 'should', 'have', 'earned', 'THE', 'HURT', 'LOCKER', 'recognition', 'accolades']",N/A

I thought it would be a great movie because it dealt with the Iraq War and I was indeed very eager to watch it. I admit I was entertained because it has some very gripping and high tension moments. All the bomb diffusion scenes and the sniper scene at the mid point were very detailed and well executed. That being said however I can't help but agree with many of the user comments pointing out the inaccuracies.-The opening scene has a man detonating the bomb with a cell phone and the team simply yells at him to put it down, had it been in real life the man would have been shot instantly.-The character Sargent First Class William James is portrayed as a rugged, careless lone wolf who ignores his teammates and at one point leaves his base to track down who he suspects killed a small boy he befriended. Had someone done these things in real life he would have been highly disciplined and more than likely discharged.-And the last thing I have a problem with the movie clich&eacute;s soldiers as war junkies who love combat and are unable to adjust to civilian life once they return home. While some military personnel may indeed go through this, most people would be glad to be out of the war and be back home with their loved ones.So to sum it all up the acting was indeed very good, all the actors gave great performances and it does have high tension scenes.

The film is heavy, long periods of filler, and should have been more cohesive. Unlike Platoon, it was if they didn't have any fear about defusing bombs.The military scenes where they go into a building showed soldiers not checking for snipers or others while standing near open windows. Remember the Aliens Sgt. saying, ""Check those corners. Check those corners!"" Of course, these guys just walk into a bomb shop. Trip wires? Oh, not in this film. Trip wires are attached to bombs that blow up soldiers going through an enemy's camp or territory. In Predator, they checked for trip wires. Guess Iraq had none.

Anyone who knows me personally (or who reads anything I post on Amazon) will agree with that.When ""The Hurt Locker"" built momentum towards the 2008-2009 awards season, I expected at least a good movie.  I know that one man's masterpiece is another man's overrated piece of garbage.  But I pretty much like everything.  I can justify just about any movie's existence, even if I don't care for it.  When it comes to movies I don't like, I can at least understand why many others love it.""The Hurt Locker"" is a failure, pure and simple.I have watched this film 6 times, and I've given up trying to play devil's advocate for it.  I don't understand its message.  I don't understand its power.  I don't understand its greatness.  I don't understand its critical praise and reputation.You may ask, ""Then why do some people like it?""There are 2 reasons I came up with: Craft and Context.In terms of craft, ""The Hurt Locker"" on a production and casting level is just fine.  Kathryn Bigelow (or her camera team) show some neat shots here and there.  The lead performances are fine, with Jeremy Renner working his heart out to bring his character to life.  And when the explosions go off, they look good.  There is a pretty decent sniper sequence about midway through the film, with finally some life breathed into the story.Boy, I wish I had more good things to say than that short paragraph.I suppose that brings me to the Context in which critical praise comes in.It's very simple: The critics and audiences that enjoyed ""The Hurt Locker"" are bringing more to the moviegoing experience than the movie is giving back.  I've read comments like:""It's a portrait of how soldiers are fueled on adrenaline.""""It provides a fair reality of why we're in Iraq.""""It's about the bravery of the men and women who serve our military.""I don't disagree with those ideas, but ""The Hurt Locker"" doesn't tell you any of that.  Critics and audiences who believe there is a deeper message within ""The Hurt Locker"" cannot provide a single piece of dramatic evidence where the movie says any of that.  I don't say that as an attack on liberals, conservatives, patriots, or anarchists.  This is an attack on people who've brought their own personal politics and patriotism to a movie that is simply very light on plot, drama, and purpose.  The individuals who praise this movie are not playing fair with those of you have not seen this film.You ever watch a murder mystery and wonder, ""How in the world was I supposed to guess that he/she could've commited the crime""?  Ever see a plot twist in a film and say, ""But if I watch this movie from the beginning again, this twist doesn't make sense""?That's what it's like listening to the high accolades of ""The Hurt Locker"", and then sitting down and watching it.  How do I know if ""The Hurt Locker"" glorifies war or doesn't?  How do I know that this story of 3 men (and a few others) is --- or isn't --- a representation of our military?I think the reason for all of this rambling is because either Mark Boal's screenplay is VERY thin, or Kathryn Bigelow & her crew failed to bring it life.  I'm going with the former because Bigelow is very capable of making a good action picture, and has experience with deep screenplays.  Mark Boal is new to the big leagues, and I'm sure writing his own observations into a script must've been a joy.  But it's not a joy for me, and I don't believe ""The Hurt Locker"" will stand the test of time.The film just isn't that interesting.  The trio of soldiers get a bomb report, go out, defuse the bomb as best as they can, talk a little bit later.... RINSE, REPEAT.  There is not dramatic arc here.  There is little character development, and very little of it interesting.  The biggest character arc involving Jeremy Renner's lead role makes absolutely no sense when put it all together.  So you see, when logic fails, presentation is everything.  And I'm afraid some heated photography, some neat sound effects, and some machismo soldierly intensity aren't enough.  After all, how many different ways can you make a bomb interesting outside of the technical level?I am proud of our armed forces.  I am proud that ""The Hurt Locker"" is one of the first films to put politics aside when exploring our Iraw presence.  And I commend Kahtyrn Bigelow, the cast, the crew, and even Mark Boal for getting their independent feature off the ground so that audiences could see it.But all of these compliments should've gone to a much better film.  After 6 viewings, I was hoping to find it.  However, I think this is one of the most critically-overrated films in a very long time.",2,I Defy Someone To Debate This One With Me,1275696000,"06 5, 2010",2010,4652,"['can', 'be', 'bit', 'film', 'snob', 'Anyone', 'who', 'personally', 'who', 'reads', 'anything', 'post', 'Amazon', 'will', 'agree', 'that.When', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'built', 'momentum', '2008-2009', 'awards', 'season', 'expected', 'least', 'good', 'movie', 'know', 'one', 'man', 'masterpiece', 'man', 'overrated', 'piece', 'garbage', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'can', 'justify', 'just', 'movie', 'existence', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'When', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'can', 'least', 'understand', 'why', 'many', 'others', 'love', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'failure', 'pure', 'simple.I', 'have', 'watched', 'film', '6', 'times', ""'ve"", 'given', 'up', 'trying', 'play', 'devil', 'advocate', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'power', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'greatness', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'critical', 'praise', 'reputation.You', 'may', 'ask', 'Then', 'why', 'do', 'people', 'are', '2', 'reasons', 'came', 'up', 'Craft', 'Context.In', 'terms', 'craft', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'production', 'casting', 'level', 'just', 'fine', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'camera', 'team', 'show', 'neat', 'shots', 'here', 'there', 'lead', 'performances', 'are', 'fine', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'working', 'heart', 'bring', 'character', 'life', 'when', 'explosions', 'go', 'off', 'look', 'good', 'pretty', 'decent', 'sniper', 'sequence', 'midway', 'film', 'finally', 'life', 'breathed', 'story.Boy', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'short', 'paragraph.I', 'suppose', 'Context', 'critical', 'praise', 'in.It', 'very', 'simple', 'critics', 'audiences', 'enjoyed', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'are', 'bringing', 'more', 'moviegoing', 'experience', 'movie', 'giving', 'back', ""'ve"", 'read', 'comments', 'portrait', 'how', 'soldiers', 'are', 'fueled', 'adrenaline', 'fair', 'reality', 'why', ""'re"", 'Iraq', 'bravery', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'serve', 'military', 'do', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'ideas', 'Hurt', 'Locker', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Critics', 'audiences', 'who', 'believe', 'deeper', 'message', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'can', 'not', 'provide', 'single', 'piece', 'dramatic', 'evidence', 'where', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'attack', 'liberals', 'conservatives', 'patriots', 'anarchists', 'attack', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'own', 'personal', 'politics', 'patriotism', 'movie', 'simply', 'very', 'light', 'plot', 'drama', 'purpose', 'individuals', 'who', 'praise', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'playing', 'fair', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film.You', 'ever', 'watch', 'murder', 'mystery', 'wonder', 'How', 'world', 'was', 'supposed', 'guess', 'he/she', 'could', ""'ve"", 'commited', 'crime', 'Ever', 'see', 'plot', 'twist', 'film', 'say', 'watch', 'movie', 'beginning', 'again', 'twist', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'what', 'listening', 'high', 'accolades', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'then', 'sitting', 'down', 'watching', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'glorifies', 'war', ""n't"", 'How', 'do', 'know', 'story', '3', 'men', 'few', 'others', ""n't"", 'representation', 'military', 'think', 'reason', 'rambling', 'Mark', 'Boal', 'screenplay', 'VERY', 'thin', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'crew', 'failed', 'bring', 'life', ""'m"", 'going', 'former', 'Bigelow', 'very', 'capable', 'making', 'good', 'action', 'picture', 'experience', 'deep', 'screenplays', 'Mark', 'Boal', 'new', 'big', 'leagues', ""'m"", 'sure', 'writing', 'own', 'observations', 'script', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'joy', 'not', 'joy', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'will', 'stand', 'test', 'time.The', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'trio', 'soldiers', 'get', 'bomb', 'report', 'go', 'out', 'bomb', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'talk', 'little', 'bit', 'later', 'RINSE', 'REPEAT', 'not', 'dramatic', 'arc', 'here', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'very', 'little', 'interesting', 'biggest', 'character', 'arc', 'involving', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'lead', 'role', 'absolutely', 'sense', 'when', 'put', 'together', 'So', 'see', 'when', 'logic', 'presentation', 'everything', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'heated', 'photography', 'neat', 'sound', 'effects', 'machismo', 'soldierly', 'intensity', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'how', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'can', 'make', 'bomb', 'interesting', 'technical', 'level', 'am', 'proud', 'armed', 'forces', 'am', 'proud', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'one', 'first', 'films', 'put', 'politics', 'aside', 'when', 'exploring', 'Iraw', 'presence', 'commend', 'Kahtyrn', 'Bigelow', 'cast', 'crew', 'even', 'Mark', 'Boal', 'getting', 'independent', 'feature', 'ground', 'audiences', 'could', 'see', 'it.But', 'compliments', 'should', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'much', 'better', 'film', '6', 'viewings', 'was', 'hoping', 'find', 'However', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'critically-overrated', 'films', 'very', 'long', 'time']",N/A

I was old enough to be drafted by the end of that war.  Went from being classified 1A to 1H (holding) as the draft and that war wound down.  I always wondered if I would have survived.  Movies like this and Platoon and Saving Private Ryan always remind me of that and just how much I hate everything to do with war and what it does to families.  It reminds me how democracy and a free press ended that conflict as public outcry eventually won, and it makes me wonder where that free press is during this war.  It reminds me that 17th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes pegged our species more than any other in that he stated that we are mostly given to selfishness and violence in our most natural state.  We hardly attain the youthful age of twenty before we're ready to kill.  And something as simple and arbitrary as beliefs, religious and cultural, neither of which are valid reasons, are all it takes to justify the violence in our minds.This movie, like all Hollywood movies, can only be expected to be technically accurate up to a certain point . . . After all it is a movie and not a documentary.  But it was real enough to bring all of that to mind.  It reminded me how our patriotic youth trust both the people in this country and our government to consider their welfare above everything else before putting them in harms way.  But I always have doubts about misplaced trust.  In Alan Greenspan's book he declares that the current conflict is largely about oil.  If that's true, then we are derelict in our duties to drive our elected leaders to do something about our gluttony when it comes to consumption of energy sources.  We are less than five percent of the earths human population but use 25% of the oil dredged up from the ground.  We import too much of that oil from places that keep the pressure pot boiling.  By contrast, Brazil is completely free of foreign sources of energy, growing it's own sugar cane crop to supply ethanol instead.  We've know since the early '70s that this was a serious problem.  I remember the long lines at the gas pumps then. And we knew that by simply changing our energy policy and fuel efficiency standards that it would equate to millions if not billions of barrels of oil per year.  And now we know the scientific facts concerning global warming and air contamination.  Forty years later, almost a half century too late, we are just beginning to wake up from our irresponsible slumber.  A nocturnal state that puts our forces, mostly Christian, in foreign territories, mostly Muslim, where we are not welcome.  To that extent, understanding the fanatical nature of our species to date, we are risking attack.  If we want to end war and keep our youth from harm, we have to change our own mentality and influence our political officials to act responsibly.  Now.  Our devotion to our patriots can't just be flag waving and patriotic song.This was a good movie. Like a train wreck, you can't stop watching. In many respects, it's too real.

And this one goes hand in hand with the best ones. It is insightful anf it attacks all aspects of what it means to be a professional soldier.  Main character is complicated - if not reckless, then he is totally oblivious about the effect he has on people working with him.  Is it the need for rush that keep him going or is it something else?  I will let you watch the movie in order to be a judge of that.The absolute credit goes to director Bigelow and the screenwriter of the film.

I say this because of the personalities they portray of the soldiers.The plot is simple they are finishing the remainder of a tour and dealing with the day to day life of war.

I'm not sure about that, but if it wins, I wouldn't complain. Katherine Bigelow's anti-war Iraq epic is loaded with suspense, fine acting, editing, script,  cinematography and all the stuff that makes an Oscar winner. It's never boring, and the characters each have an agenda. Interesting. Also interesting is that it made the rounds of indie film festivals in 2008. The 2008 Indie Spirits nominated it for 2 awards: Jeremy Renner as Best Actor, and Anthony Mackie as Best Supp Actor. No mention of Ms. Bigelow, or Best Picture. I'm going out on a limb here, but I think Ms Bigelow will win the Oscar for Director, but her ex-husband's film will win Best Picture (Avatar). The DVD has lots of extras, and Ms Bigelow has a tremendous amount of personal ""touch"" that I think is solely responsible for its power.

1252776,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,B00275EGWY,Richard Masloski,"[6, 10]","This undeservedly overly hyped out-of-all-proportion movie is a vast disappointment.  While successful in its depiction of the old adage that War is Hell, this movie really doesn't show us anything new that we haven't seen before in war movies equally well-done if not better done than this one.  It is a well-enough made pic about the hell that is (or was) Iraq since the movie is set in 2004.  But that is all it is.  There are some well-done action sequences and there is a requisite amount of tension since we are primarily dealing with a bomb squad...but there is no script worth mentioning, no great acting worth waxing ecstatic about, no profoundities to ponder, no characters we ever truly come to like and care about.  It is very akin in parts to ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Black Hawk Down.""  It owes alot to ""Platoon"" and ""Apocalpyse Now.""  (The movies just mentioned, by the way, are all far better than this one.)  It's main character is a descendant of Steve McQueen's war-loving, isolated characters in ""The War Lover"" and ""Hell is for Heroes.""  Why it won Best Picture is not because it is a great movie, but because it was the PC thing to do to help boost morale amongst today's military - and to break the male-dominated Best Director award by giving it to the Academy's first-ever female director.  And, as mentioned by many others on Amazon, there are several unrealistic sequences and a cliched death that I could see coming an hour before.  Now, I have not seen ""Avatar"" and have no desire to see so - the blue aliens just look very odious and unrealistic to me and James Cameron writes awful scripts.  (""Titanic"" was a silly little love story riddled with lousy dialogue and a soap opera plot.) Having said that, maybe ""Avatar"" did get the shaft on Oscar night. If ""The Hurt Locker"" is what the Academy deems a ""Best Picture"" then, well, it is no wonder they forgot to include not just Farrah Fawcet in the sequence remembering those persons affiliated with the film industry who have passed over - but also Edward Woodward and Patrick McGoohan were ignored.

While I have not seen every single ""Iraq-themed"" movie made, I've seen enough and read enough to know that the writers and directors just couldn't stop themselves from getting preachy, wedging overtly anti-Bush statements where they didn't fit or, worst of all, implying that all our troops are just crazy maniacs.  In HURT LOCKER, director Kathryn Bigelow knows that she can let a realistic story speak for itself.And what does it say for itself?  ""War is hell.""  ""War is bad.""  ""War makes good people do stupid things and things they'll regret forever.""  And most interestingly, ""War is a drug.""  If you want to generalize these statements to just the Iraq War, you can.  But it isn't too hard to understand the very specific, Iraq-based events of HURT LOCKER could be extrapolated to any war.  The technology has changed incredibly...but not the basic emotions.I though THE HURT LOCKER was simply a great war movie.  And I'm grateful for it.  It shows the ugly side of Iraq.  But it also shows some of the reasons we're there.  It shows troops doing horrible things...but also heroic, selfless things.  It shows how troops can fall apart and hurt innocents...but also how they can pull together at great risk to take out the bad guys and save the ""good"" guys.  But more than that, it is a fascinating ride along with 3 very special members of a bomb disposal unit.Is there anything more tense than the scene where the bomb expert is trying to disarm the bomb before it kills him?  How many movies have we seen that in?  And it almost always works to get the blood racing and to move rear-ends to the edges of seats.  Imagine that scene, done REALLY well, about 6 or 8 times in one movie!  There are almost no moments in this film in which the tension lets up.Staff Sgt James (Jeremy Renner) comes to Bravo unit's bomb disposal group after their previous expert met an untimely end.  He is the veteran of over 800 disposals, and when it comes to disarming bombs...he does what he feels he must.  Protocol be damned, and often, his own safety.  He's reckless, yet experience has given him an instinct for the work.  He drives his teammates crazy with fear or angry for his disobedience...but again and again, he proves he knows what he's doing.  He is addicted to the rush of thrusting himself into danger that most normal men would simply wet themselves over.  He can't help it.Working with him is Sgt. Sandborn (Anthony Mackie).  He's the guy who clears the scene, and leads the efforts to watch for terrorists while the bombs are being disarmed.  Because these devices are NOT just ticking timebombs.  In many cases, the terrorist with the trigger is nearby, waiting to set it off with a flip of a switch or the dialing of a cell phone.  Sandborn and his closest assistant, Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are accustomed to running the show, looking out for the bombers, and shooting them when needed.  James has no patience for their carefulness...he seems to assume everyone is working on the same accelerated schedule he is.Naturally, this causes tension in the men...which only adds to the natural tension of the disarmings.  Almost every moment these men share together is fraught with tension...and it's all very believable.  Bigelow has some great technical know-how, but she demonstrates it in her camera-work, editing and pacing in such a way to ADD to the story, not distract from it.  Every trick she breaks out is in service to the story.  Her job is to leave you wrung out at the end of the film.  And to leave you reluctantly admiring the cocky, perhaps borderline insane James, along with his more ""normal"" but also very brave cohorts.The ""war is hell"" message is never overt...it's just there in all the things these soldiers must endure.  About midway through the film is a lengthy sequence during which the 3 Americans and a small group of Brits take fire from the enemy and are forced to hunker down in a very insecure hillside.  The scene is tense, riveting and yet also shows the incredible stretches of just simply WAITING for something to happen.  Imagine the boredom you would feel if you had so sit outside and wait all day for your mailman to arrive.  Now imagine that it's incredibly hot, you are not allowed to move a muscle and instead of the mailman, it's a sharpshooter who wants to kill you.  How can the nerves stand hour after hour of fear?The three leads in the film are outstanding.  I suspect there's a good chance Jeremy Renner will get an Oscar nomination.  His character is full of quirks and ticks and flashy behavior, but Renner never pushes his performance on bit beyond what the demands of his character are.  It's also a very charismatic performance, and should help turn this solid character actor (28 WEEKS LATER, ASSASINATION OF JESSE JAMES, NORTH COUNTRY) into a star.  Geraghty is very sympathetic as the conflicted Eldridge and Mackie is a great mixture of hardass and human.Bigelow (the wonderful STRANGE DAYS) does almost everything right in this film.  I only balked at the distracting ""cameos.""  It felt a bit jarring to suddenly encounter actors like Ralph Fiennes or David Morse, although both are very good.  Worst of all was the sudden, jarring arrival of Evangeline Lilly (""Lost"").  I was just so surprised to see a familiar TV face in this film that I was completely pulled out of the film for a moment.  These are minor speedbumps, though, along a very solid (if dusty and brown) road.THE HURT LOCKER is the kind of film the all-too-common tag ""must see"" should be applied to.

1252782,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00275EGWY,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 4]","The Hurt Locker (Kathryn Bigelow, 2009)Kathryn Bigelow has been one of my favorite directors for over twenty years now, ever since I first saw Near Dark, which is on my list of the hundred best movies ever made. 1995's Strange Days confirmed that diagnosis, and I'll even admit to her two intervening films, Point Break and Blue Steel, being guilty pleasures. But I am in the minority; Bigelow has never really gotten the attention she deserves from professional critics, in my estimation. Actually, strike that--Kathryn Bigelow's time has come. The Hurt Locker is a movie that has ""Oscar nominations"" written all over it. It is gripping, brilliant, and the best war movie since...well, I've been thinking about that in the days since I saw it, and I'm probably overlooking one or two, but the name that keeps coming to mind when I try to finish that sentence is The Longest Day. (Which, if you don't recall, was made in 1962.)Warning: the summary paragraph contains a minor (I believe) spoiler that's kind of unavoidable. If you're planning on seeing the film and haven't, skip it.The Hurt Locker tells the story of an Iraqi bomb disposal unit led by the methodical Matt Thompson (Memento's Guy Pearce). Until, that is, he's killed in the film's opening scene. The army replaces him with William James (28 Weeks Later...'s Jeremy Renner), who is everything Thompson was not, most notably an adrenalin junkie. (Think Vin Diesel in XXX, but with not as good a voice and not nearly the number of toys.) The bulk of the film is a slice-of-life kind of thing about James and his subordinates-cum-partners, Sanborn (Notorious' Anthony Mackie) and Eldredge (An American Crime's Brian Geraghty). I can't remember about what profession it was said that it involves endless stretches of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror, but being in a bomb-disposal unit in a war zone? I can't imagine a better definition than that.And that's what makes The Hurt Locker such a brilliant film; anyone can film a tense scene of someone defusing a bomb and make it tense. Bigelow manages, through James' personality, to make the endless-stretches-of-boredom scenes even more tense than the bomb-disposal scenes. (There's a great example of this about halfway through the movie, when James is defusing a particularly complex car bomb, while Sanborn and Eldredge are keeping watch. The two scenes surrounding it are fraught with tension, while we never have any doubt that James is going to come through the defusing without a scratch. Why? Because he is convinced. And we believe him.) We get a subplot about James making friends with a local kid, a soccer-playing DVD-bootleg-selling roustabout who calls himself Beckham (Christopher Sayegh), and as that unfolds, it's one of the tensest parts of the film. Part of the reason for this is that this isn't really a film about bomb disposal, about war, or about Iraq in general as much as it is a character study of William James--how Iraq changes him, how he changes those around him, and perhaps most importantly, how he changes Iraq. And I'll try to say this in such a way as not to make it a spoiler, but you want impressive? Bigelow does in ten minutes what took Michael Cimino an hour in the third act of The Deer Hunter. And does it, arguably, better.But all this is secondary, at least while you're sitting in the theater, to the simple fact that while you are watching this movie, you are there, in the heat and the sand. Bigelow shot more than two hundred hours of footage for a hundred-twenty-five-minute film. Obsessive perfectionism? Perhaps, but the success of the result is evident.I have been lucky enough to see two of the first truly great films of the new millennium this week. One was Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Tokyo Sonata (below). The other is The Hurt Locker. Do what you must to see this, preferably on the big screen. It is a war film, true, but it is so, so much more than that. I have only touched the tip of the iceberg here (I realized just now I forgot to mention a cameo from one of my all-time favorite actors, David Morse); I could go on talking about things that make this movie great all day. If there is a failing in the film, it is in that last ten minutes I mentioned above; doing it better than Cimino still means you're ripping off Cimino, kinda. This is one of those very few times when the ending that was absolutely, positively right--the only ending the film could have had that would keep it true to itself--still felt like it could have been better had Bigelow managed to come up with the ending that was just slightly wrong, but a whole lot more original. Still, that is the most minor of minor quibbles, and let's face it, it's a great ending nonetheless. See it. You won't regret it. **** ",5,Tension has a new face.,1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,4763,"['Hurt', 'Locker', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', '2009', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'twenty', 'years', 'now', 'ever', 'first', 'saw', 'Near', 'Dark', 'list', 'hundred', 'best', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', '1995', 'Strange', 'Days', 'confirmed', 'diagnosis', ""'ll"", 'even', 'admit', 'two', 'intervening', 'films', 'Point', 'Break', 'Blue', 'Steel', 'being', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'am', 'minority', 'Bigelow', 'never', 'really', 'gotten', 'attention', 'professional', 'critics', 'estimation', 'Actually', 'strike', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'time', 'come', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'written', 'gripping', 'brilliant', 'best', 'war', 'movie', 'well', ""'ve"", 'been', 'thinking', 'days', 'saw', ""'m"", 'probably', 'overlooking', 'one', 'two', 'name', 'coming', 'mind', 'when', 'try', 'finish', 'sentence', 'Longest', 'Day', 'Which', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'was', 'made', '1962', 'Warning', 'summary', 'paragraph', 'minor', 'believe', 'spoiler', 'kind', 'unavoidable', ""'re"", 'planning', 'seeing', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'skip', 'it.The', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'story', 'Iraqi', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'unit', 'led', 'methodical', 'Matt', 'Thompson', 'Memento', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'killed', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'army', 'William', 'James', '28', 'Weeks', 'Later', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'who', 'everything', 'Thompson', 'was', 'not', 'most', 'notably', 'adrenalin', 'junkie', 'Think', 'Vin', 'Diesel', 'XXX', 'not', 'good', 'voice', 'not', 'nearly', 'number', 'toys', 'bulk', 'film', 'slice-of-life', 'kind', 'thing', 'James', 'subordinates-cum-partners', 'Sanborn', 'Notorious', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Eldredge', 'American', 'Crime', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'profession', 'was', 'said', 'endless', 'stretches', 'boredom', 'punctuated', 'moments', 'sheer', 'terror', 'being', 'bomb-disposal', 'unit', 'war', 'zone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'better', 'definition', 'that.And', 'what', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'brilliant', 'film', 'anyone', 'can', 'film', 'tense', 'scene', 'someone', 'defusing', 'bomb', 'make', 'tense', 'Bigelow', 'manages', 'James', 'personality', 'make', 'endless-stretches-of-boredom', 'scenes', 'even', 'more', 'tense', 'bomb-disposal', 'scenes', 'great', 'example', 'halfway', 'movie', 'when', 'James', 'defusing', 'particularly', 'complex', 'car', 'bomb', 'Sanborn', 'Eldredge', 'are', 'keeping', 'watch', 'two', 'scenes', 'surrounding', 'are', 'fraught', 'tension', 'never', 'have', 'doubt', 'James', 'going', 'come', 'defusing', 'scratch', 'Why', 'convinced', 'believe', 'get', 'subplot', 'James', 'making', 'friends', 'local', 'kid', 'soccer-playing', 'DVD-bootleg-selling', 'roustabout', 'who', 'Beckham', 'Christopher', 'Sayegh', 'one', 'tensest', 'parts', 'film', 'Part', 'reason', ""n't"", 'really', 'film', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'war', 'Iraq', 'general', 'as', 'much', 'character', 'study', 'William', 'James', 'how', 'Iraq', 'how', 'perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'how', 'Iraq', ""'ll"", 'try', 'say', 'such', 'way', 'not', 'make', 'spoiler', 'want', 'impressive', 'Bigelow', 'ten', 'minutes', 'what', 'took', 'Michael', 'Cimino', 'hour', 'third', 'act', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'arguably', 'better.But', 'secondary', 'least', ""'re"", 'sitting', 'theater', 'simple', 'fact', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'are', 'there', 'heat', 'sand', 'Bigelow', 'shot', 'more', 'two', 'hundred', 'hours', 'footage', 'hundred-twenty-five-minute', 'film', 'Obsessive', 'perfectionism', 'Perhaps', 'success', 'result', 'evident.I', 'have', 'been', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'two', 'first', 'truly', 'great', 'films', 'new', 'millennium', 'week', 'One', 'was', 'Kiyoshi', 'Kurosawa', 'Tokyo', 'Sonata', 'other', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Do', 'what', 'must', 'see', 'preferably', 'big', 'screen', 'war', 'film', 'true', 'so', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'have', 'only', 'touched', 'tip', 'iceberg', 'here', 'realized', 'just', 'now', 'forgot', 'mention', 'cameo', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actors', 'David', 'Morse', 'could', 'go', 'talking', 'things', 'make', 'movie', 'great', 'day', 'failing', 'film', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'mentioned', 'doing', 'better', 'Cimino', 'still', ""'re"", 'ripping', 'off', 'Cimino', 'kinda', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'ending', 'was', 'absolutely', 'positively', 'right', 'only', 'ending', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'would', 'keep', 'true', 'still', 'felt', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'Bigelow', 'managed', 'come', 'up', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'slightly', 'wrong', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'original', 'Still', 'most', 'minor', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'let', 'face', 'great', 'ending', 'nonetheless', 'See', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', '****']",N/A

1252786,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00275EGWY,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 4]","Unlike many of the earlier films on the same subject, ""The Hurt Locker"" starts off by accepting the Iraq war as a given.  That is to say it doesn't try to place the issue in any kind of larger sociopolitical context or to explain why the Americans felt compelled to wage the conflict in the first place.  Instead, it focuses on the everyday activities of a three-man Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit (EOD) whose job it is to dismantle, as safely as possible, the literally hundreds of still-to-be-detonated IEDs strewn across the streets of Baghdad.  The leader of the trio has just been killed in the line of duty and has now been replaced by a newcomer whose seeming recklessness and flagrant disregard for protocol doesn't sit well with the other members of the team, who feel that their own survival is being needlessly threatened by his carelessness - especially now that there is less than a month-and-a-half left to go before the team is to be taken out of rotation.Before getting to the more ""literary"" aspects of the film, let's just say right up front that, on a strictly ""cinematic"" level, ""The Hurt Locker"" is an astonishing accomplishment in every sense of the term.  Director Kathryn Bigelow employs hand-held cameras, razor-sharp editing and an abundance of point-of-view shots to create a film of palpable, nail-biting  immediacy that plunges the audience directly into the heart of the action.  Yet, she punctuates that with the nonstop sound of jet fighters roaring overhead just to remind us that, hard as it may be to imagine at times, there is an even larger war taking place somewhere beyond the reaches of the one we see here.  This story is clearly just one of many.On a thematic level, the movie explores the various ways these three men cope with the inconceivable stress of life on the battlefield.  Staff Sergeant William James finds an adrenaline-pumping thrill in living life on the edge, of always being just a hair-trigger away from possible death.  Specialist Owen Eldridge, on the other hand, has become so obsessed with death that he fears he will freeze up right at the moment when he needs to be most clear-headed, steady-handed and steely-nerved.  And Sergeant T.J. Sanborn occupies a kind of pragmatic, middle ground between the two, willing to put his life on the line to get the job done but not to willy-nilly just tempt fate for the sake of doing so.  Yet, thanks to Marc Boal`s perceptive screenplay, each man emerges as a complex individual in his own right, never a ""type.""  James, for instance, may be wild and reckless, but he also has a caring, compassionate side that he reveals in off-handed and unexpected moments of tenderness towards others and loyalty towards his men.  And there's a stunning coda that forces us, perhaps reluctantly, to see James in an entirely different light from how we've been viewing him up to that point.Relative unknowns Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are heartbreakingly effective as James, Sanborn and Eldridge, respectively, managing to create fully realized, empathetic characters amidst all the pyrotechnic war-movie effects.  And even a few familiar faces - Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes and Evangeline Lilly from ""Lost"" - show up at various points in the film (in a way, this use of ""stars"" - though obviously done for purposes of procuring financing - could easily have compromised the integrity of the picture, but the unusual way Bigelow uses them helps to mitigate that effect).The real key to ""The Hurt Locker""'s success is that it never sacrifices intimacy for the grander picture, never allows the war movie setting to supercede the characters and their stories.  It is first, last and always a movie about  ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances.  It's also unforgettable.",5,an extraordinary cinematic achievement,1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,3800,"['many', 'earlier', 'films', 'same', 'subject', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'accepting', 'Iraq', 'war', 'given', 'say', ""n't"", 'try', 'place', 'issue', 'kind', 'larger', 'sociopolitical', 'context', 'explain', 'why', 'Americans', 'felt', 'compelled', 'wage', 'conflict', 'first', 'place', 'Instead', 'everyday', 'activities', 'three-man', 'Explosive', 'Ordinance', 'Disposal', 'Unit', 'EOD', 'job', 'dismantle', 'as', 'safely', 'possible', 'literally', 'hundreds', 'still-to-be-detonated', 'IEDs', 'strewn', 'streets', 'Baghdad', 'leader', 'trio', 'just', 'been', 'killed', 'line', 'duty', 'now', 'been', 'replaced', 'newcomer', 'seeming', 'recklessness', 'flagrant', 'disregard', 'protocol', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'other', 'members', 'team', 'who', 'feel', 'own', 'survival', 'being', 'needlessly', 'threatened', 'carelessness', 'especially', 'now', 'less', 'month-and-a-half', 'left', 'go', 'team', 'be', 'taken', 'rotation.Before', 'getting', 'more', 'literary', 'aspects', 'film', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'strictly', 'cinematic', 'level', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'astonishing', 'accomplishment', 'sense', 'term', 'Director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'razor-sharp', 'editing', 'abundance', 'point-of-view', 'shots', 'create', 'film', 'palpable', 'nail-biting', 'immediacy', 'audience', 'directly', 'heart', 'action', 'nonstop', 'sound', 'jet', 'fighters', 'roaring', 'overhead', 'just', 'remind', 'hard', 'may', 'be', 'imagine', 'times', 'even', 'larger', 'war', 'taking', 'place', 'somewhere', 'reaches', 'one', 'see', 'here', 'story', 'clearly', 'just', 'one', 'many.On', 'thematic', 'level', 'movie', 'various', 'ways', 'three', 'men', 'cope', 'inconceivable', 'stress', 'life', 'battlefield', 'Staff', 'Sergeant', 'William', 'James', 'adrenaline-pumping', 'thrill', 'living', 'life', 'edge', 'always', 'being', 'just', 'hair-trigger', 'away', 'possible', 'death', 'Specialist', 'Owen', 'Eldridge', 'other', 'hand', 'become', 'so', 'obsessed', 'death', 'will', 'freeze', 'up', 'right', 'moment', 'when', 'be', 'most', 'clear-headed', 'steady-handed', 'steely-nerved', 'Sergeant', 'T.J.', 'Sanborn', 'kind', 'pragmatic', 'middle', 'ground', 'two', 'willing', 'put', 'life', 'line', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'not', 'willy-nilly', 'just', 'tempt', 'fate', 'sake', 'doing', 'so', 'thanks', 'Marc', 'Boal', 's', 'perceptive', 'screenplay', 'man', 'complex', 'individual', 'own', 'right', 'never', 'type', 'James', 'instance', 'may', 'be', 'wild', 'reckless', 'also', 'caring', 'compassionate', 'side', 'off-handed', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'tenderness', 'towards', 'others', 'loyalty', 'towards', 'men', 'stunning', 'coda', 'perhaps', 'reluctantly', 'see', 'James', 'entirely', 'different', 'light', 'how', ""'ve"", 'been', 'viewing', 'point.Relative', 'unknowns', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'are', 'heartbreakingly', 'effective', 'James', 'Sanborn', 'Eldridge', 'respectively', 'managing', 'create', 'fully', 'realized', 'empathetic', 'characters', 'amidst', 'pyrotechnic', 'war-movie', 'effects', 'even', 'few', 'familiar', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'Lost', 'show', 'up', 'various', 'points', 'film', 'way', 'use', 'stars', 'obviously', 'done', 'purposes', 'procuring', 'financing', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'compromised', 'integrity', 'picture', 'unusual', 'way', 'Bigelow', 'mitigate', 'effect', '.The', 'real', 'key', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'success', 'never', 'intimacy', 'grander', 'picture', 'never', 'war', 'movie', 'setting', 'supercede', 'characters', 'stories', 'first', 'last', 'always', 'movie', 'ordinary', 'people', 'caught', 'up', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'also', 'unforgettable']",N/A

I did not feel like I was being lectured about to politics surrounding the Iraq war; although, you do get the sense that some of the troops are disillusioned by their experiences. No, this seems to be a more personal story about Renner's character and how the intense focus and adrenaline rush he gets from his work develops into an obsession. The man ultimately looses his ability to feel anything or function normally outside the bubble of this razor's-edge existence.  And that is basically the whole point of the movie; to depict the emotional, spiritual, and psychological damage that this war and, particularly, the IED disposal team sustain under such pressure.

I use the term ""artistic"" because, rather than have a conventional 1-2-3 plot and a jingoistic, war-is-hell undertone, this film brilliantly combines moments of incredible suspense with scene after scene of rare restraint and perception. The film ostensibly is about what the men encounter during their last 35 days or so of their rotation, but goes deeper towards showing the cumulative effect of war on the once normal psyche, in its terrifying as well as intoxicating aspects. Upon first viewing the film I was waiting for the hook, the story, to get going, and was let down after one didn't show itself. As the film progresses, however, you realize that that wasn't its intention, but rather to show the situation in the Middle East with a calmly observant eye. From that tableau we become attuned to the thoughts and drives of the characters in a way not often experienced in a film, to the point where their silences tell you everything you need to know. Not to say that this is a quiet film, for the great majority of it are masterful scenes of direction, acting, and editing that create suspenseful scenes of conflict that are as exciting as anything you're likely to see in a film. This isn't standard war fare, but reaches deeper and gets in your head and stays there.

She directed a brilliant and visceral Iraq war movie, which unlike many of its peers, is also apolitical.  It's not overly preachy (In the Valley of Elah or Stop Loss) or pure action (The Kingdom), but manages to strike its own ground.  The scenes are gritty, shaky;  thankfully the shaky cam/documentary style footage is tastefully done here.  The movie was filmed on location in Jordan, lending to the film's authenticity and immersivity.  The viewer can almost taste the dust in the air, and feel the stares from the unwelcoming populace.  It's the first mainstream movie to highlight the work of bomb defusal technicians , and it's a thankless and extremely hazardous job.  The movie is Black Hawk Down good, albeit on a more intimate level.The movie follows three members of Bravo Company's Explosive Ordanance Disposal (EOD) squad, as they struggle to finish the last few days of their year long tour of duty.  Everyone copes differently; Specialist Eldridge (Geraghty) is overwhelmed at times with the death that surrounds them, Staff Sergeant James (Renner) is addicted to the rush of battle, and Sergeant Sanborn (Mackie) supports James as best he can.  James is a complex, fascinating and tragic character; he's extremely competent, yet eccentric and even reckless to the point where his teammates consider fragging him in order to make it back alive.  In a thoughtful gesture, he respects the work of his adversaries and keeps all the trigger mechanisms of bombs he has defused in the past.  Every engagement the soldiers experience until their departure affects them, and we see every emotional impact.Big Hollywood names like Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, and David Morse make short, but memorable appearances.  Even LOST actress Evangelline Lily has an extended cameo as James' wife.  The bomb defusal scenes are nerve-wracklingly tense, and the audience sweats alongside the defusing technician.  The team constantly scans for snipers, or the suspicious civilian about to make a cell phone call to trigger an IED.  The movie does an excellent job of communicating the hazards of the EOD job, and one leaves with a deep appreciation of their work.6 stars, highly recommended.

Instead it focuses on the daily lives of a taught squadron of bomb disposal experts who patrol the dusty Baghdad streets and dry desert scapes searching for and diffusing the ramshackle bombs put in place by insurgents trying to sabbotage the US reconstruction efforts.The drama weaves closely into the lives of the men, dominated by Sargeant William James, a curiously eager soldier who recklessly seeks out dangerous bomb situations, often failing to heed the warnings of his colleagues.The plot is taught, not in a synthetic Hollywood way with tension artificially built in leading to some carefully contrived denoument, but in a realistic, frustrating flatlining way. The days tick down to the end of the bomb squad's tour of duty, and the heat, relentless opposition from guerilla insurgents and cruelty (in one memorable scene, insurgents use the corpse of a small boy to conceal explosives) all take their toll on the men. They quarrel, gossip, banter and fight. The narrative in a way flatlines, replicating the true situation in Iraq where it was (still is) very difficult to tell what sort of impact and progress is being made.But the comradeship between the men is real, and this is developed in the film through touching scenes, such as James supplying an exhausted colleague (and rival) with water after he has been staring out at insurgents in the desert heat for hours.Realistic cinematography, with a good mix of panoramic shots and action close ups. It is a skilled, intelligent and moving film. well deserving of its accolades.

It has plenty of tension throughout and the use of slow motion cinematography heightens the impact of some of the scenes, as bombs kick up dust, debris and spent gun cartridges cartwheel end over end. By the end this tension has made you see the war from the soldiers perspective a little more and you start to understand their outlook on danger and fighting, even if it makes you further question the involvement in Iraq. The typically gung ho American persona grates initially, but this soon fades as you become more involved in the film. You can see why this won the Oscar and the direction is very impressive and this ranks highly in films made so far about the Iraq war.

I should also point out many people tend to exaggerate their combat expertise and experience and just because you wore a uniform doesn't make you an expert on all things military.

Sure, some movies tend to go way over the top in regards to what's realistic or even plausible but there is one caveat that all of the people who are lambasting the movie based on realism are failing to grasp. Realism doesn't sell; if I were to make a movie about the average day for an average soldier no one would watch it.

I watched this movie and I think it was a very good, entertaining movie and that's what movies are supposed to do, ENTERTAIN. The difference between myself and some of the negative reviewers is that I'm not naive enough to watch a movie and think it is fact or that writers/directors don't take MASSIVE liberties with situations or their realistic nature; even ""based on a true story"" movies do this because if they were 100% fact and no fiction no one would watch because again, they would be very boring. I am smart enough to separate reality from Hollywood movie making and I don't need personal experiences to do this.

White,"[4, 13]","The one thing I really have an annoyance over with this film, which caused me to audibly groan as it happened - was the depiction of British SAS or Spec Forces as incompetent, irresponsible and reckless cowboys. Let me set the scene, which rang so untrue as to ruin the entire movie for me.The 3 member bomb team just stumble across a stranded SAS team in the desert, the SAS team have two prisoners and have a flat tire. Apparently, the SAS team are stranded because they need to change a tire and have ""used up their wrench.""1 - A British person would never use the word wrench for tire iron.The British SAS fella then says they used it up because the bloke changing the tire ""threw it at somebody!"" GIVE ME A BREAK! Does anybody believe for a minute that a professional crew of SAS with 2 important prisoners, would recklessly throw a tire iron at another member of the crew and thus make their situation worse by losing it that way? NO, NO, NO, NO!This depiction of the SAS/Mercs at this early stage is not only beyond moronic, it is patronizing and utterly unbelievable. Whoever the technical advisers were on this movie require being left in a room with a member of the REAL SAS for a few hours. Guess what happens next?So next, there appears a sniper on the scene and the two groups come under fire. The leader of the SAS team calls for the Barret sniper rifle, but his handling of it and his placement deliberately serve to show his total incompetence and lack of field craft with this weapon. Not only does he fail to have a spotter but he also places himself clearly in view of the enemy sniper ... and guess what folks ... as you would expect from someone doing this, he is shot and killed!But then ... guess who slides in to save the day? The 3 man Marine crew .... and they take up the same stupid position the SAS guy took up, but this time the enemy sniper decided he won't fire on the Marines until they have spotted him and can kill him. So what this scene is telling the audience is that stock standard Marines are smarter than British Spec Forces and better soldiers.

1252821,A256QKS1DIQ54U,B00275EGWY,T. Bollinger,"[0, 2]","Really the only film of 2009 that had any business being nominated for the year&#8217;s Best Picture Oscar at the 2010 Academy Awards, &#8216;The Hurt Locker&#8217; is important, if nothing else, due to the fact that Kathryn Bigelow became the first (and so far the only) woman in history to win the Academy Award for Best Director. Given the recent success and additional Best Picture nomination &#8212; as well as the shameful lack of another Best Director nomination &#8212; for her awesome &#8216;Zero Dark Thirty&#8217; film, which chronicled the hunt for and assassination of Osama bin Laden, I think it&#8217;s pretty obvious that Bigelow is behaving far more like an artistic and veteran director than her ex-husband, James Cameron. While the Cam-Man has been busy over the past 15 years making mass-market sellout, albeit technically impressive, guilty pleasures like 1997&#8242;s &#8216;Titanic&#8217; and laughably manipulative cheese-fests like &#8216;Avatar&#8217; in 2009, Bigelow has been making movies that don&#8217;t constantly bash you over the head with their simplicity. &#8216;The Hurt Locker&#8217; was her first, real claim to fame, and what a great film it is. THL forgoes any sort of political commentary &#8212; really a first for the massive wave of Iraq War dramatizations &#8212; and instead focuses its narrative on a very personal level. Bigelow zooms the magnifying glass on IED-unit, in particular the man responsible for defusing the bombs frequently found in the field, played by Jeremy Renner, and spends her efforts amplifying the tension and emotion of soldiers in a deeply hostile environment. It&#8217;s a highly effective film that relies heavily on Bigelow&#8217;s excellent camerawork and cinematography, and the intensity of many of the film&#8217;s scenes is its main selling point.The script is fantastically paced, and gives the viewer plenty of time to breath in between the tense bomb-defusal scenes. The set pieces themselves are masterworks of intensity and insert us in the shoes of characters who are constantly surrounded by hostility, feeling as if danger could come around the corner at any moment, and any civilian may be an imminent threat to their survival. The inability to know who to trust is emphasized over and over in THL, with most of the key characters resorting to trusting nobody outside their unit. The way this tension builds and is held so effectively without ever feeling draining is extremely impressive and unforgettable. Of particular noteworthiness is the sniper battle that occurs about halfway through the film, which is shot in a glorious, beautiful way that combines the vast, openness of the desert landscape with the deadly art of the long-shot. Violence in this film is used sparingly, but it feels especially deadly and impactful when it does occur. The opening scene in particular is quite memorable and does a good job of introducing the film&#8217;s concepts of death from any direction and the extreme level of tension that arises, as well as showcasing the movie&#8217;s supremely effective cinematography.While most general audiences enjoyed the film and critics raved about the film&#8217;s intensity and cinematography, there has been a fairly large amount of criticism directed at &#8216;The Hurt Locker&#8217; from Iraq war veterans for its inaccuracies regarding troop behavior, equipment, and interactions with each other. I was actually quite shocked at the level of disdain and snide comments that were directed at the film&#8217;s supposed faults on websites selling the DVD/Blu-Ray of the movie, such as Amazon.This is my take on the whole thing, as I really enjoyed THL a lot and think that overall, Bigelow did a great job on it. I&#8217;ll start with some preliminary explanations. While I find a lot of Asian viewers&#8217; complaints about Boyle&#8217;s &#8216;Slumdog&#8217; annoying and mostly founded in misplaced indignation, I can sort of see where they&#8217;re coming from with the whole, British-directed film about India stealing a lot of Bollywood spotlight in the West, and with the whole &#8220;Slumdog&#8221; title thing, but this &#8216;Hurt Locker&#8217; nitpicking&#8230;not so much. A lot servicemen and women complain that the details in THL are so off they render the film unwatchable, and most don&#8217;t understand why the film was so highly praised. I&#8217;ll tell ya why it was praised: It was an awesome movie. As far as the believability issue is concerned, let me put forth an example from &#8216;The Raid,&#8217; which I also really enjoyed. What I didn&#8217;t mention in my official review was that there were several instances in the movie when, during a one-on-one or two-on-one fight, the character(s) who had the upper hand could have easily finished the fight by mounting or submitting their opponent, or ended the conflict via some form of grappling. Instead, they would either drag their opponent to their feet and punch them in their face yet again, or their opponent would miraculously spring to their feet in the nick of time. Again, this happened multiple times throughout the film. I didn&#8217;t notice this because I am some sort of professional martial artist or UFC fighter &#8212; I&#8217;ve only occasionally trained in MMA and I&#8217;ve watched UFC a lot. However, I overlooked this, because the fights were still intense and brutal and really entertaining. I simply suspended my disbelief, even though these moments stood out to me and could have drastically changed those fights in real life. This is a matter of suspension of belief that all films require, and this applies just as much to a film like THL, which is neither claiming to be a documentary nor based on a true story. It is a work of fiction, just like &#8216;The Social Network, a film that also made up entire segments and characters in it&#8217;s script because those fictionalized devices made for a more interesting story.I guess it all boils down to an acceptable, reasonable level of a viewer&#8217;s suspension of disbelief. The question is, of course, what is an acceptable level of disbelief for a film? What amount is being too lenient and allowing for ludicrous actions on-screen (veterans&#8217; opinions of THL), and when does the demand for realism become too stringent and stifles narrative film-making into the realm of (overall relatively boring) documentary film-making? Are you being too lazy, or too nitpicky? Also, one has to consider whether certain character actions and plot devices fit within the universe of a particular film. Certain things may fit in a Star Wars film that may be very out of place in a Star Trek film.In my opinion, people bitching about the inaccuracies to a film like THL have run way past the boundary of pointless nitpicking and unjustified criticism. As I said earlier, Bigelow&#8217;s film is a work of fiction and is not trying to be a war documentary or even claim that it is based on true events (and most films that are supposedly &#8220;based on a true story&#8221; usually, in fact, are not based on facts at all). I guess that because THL is not exactly a &#8216;Rambo&#8217;-esque, completely-over-the-top, 80s shoot-em-up, some viewers may misunderstand the movie&#8217;s intentions, but I think that this, once again, boils down to audience maturity and putting things in perspective, or putting a film as a whole in context. THL is an intensely shot, suspenseful action film that is set in Baghdad. That is all. It is not trying to be anything else. Complaining about minute things like soldier uniforms, how exactly servicemen address officers, and the particular arrangement of an IED unit strategy is such a complete waste of time and effort, because all these things are so trivial. Given how many classic and widely loved films are very often either historically or culturally inaccurate, politically incorrect or flat-out racist, or only highlight blatantly biased viewpoints, I&#8217;m really not sure what the big deal here is with THL. We constantly overlook things like the absence of non-American troops in the D-Day invasion in &#8216;Saving Private Ryan,&#8217; the highly biased Southern point of view of &#8216;Gone with the Wind,&#8217; and the chilled monkey brains (among other things) in &#8216;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,&#8217; because those are, overall, great movies, and we can forgive some of their fudges in realism. While I wouldn&#8217;t place THL on the same level as any of those classics, I still adamantly defend it as a very well made film that is by far the best of all the Iraq War dramatizations. And it is every bit as fun and intense a ride as a just-the-facts doc like &#8216;The War Tapes.&#8217;The only significant weakness of THL is that none of its characters are very memorable, although Jeremy Renner&#8217;s protagonist is a quite interesting character study. Really though, THL is almost an &#8220;experimental-action film&#8221; that focuses nearly all its efforts on the beauty of the kill shot and the intensity of a desert war. It is amazing how much more interesting a film like THL is than something like &#8216;Act of Valor.&#8217; Bigelow&#8217;s piece has relatively uninteresting characters, top to bottom, yet its action and cinematography basically blow most other films out of the water and make for a great experience. Also, I&#8217;m sure having actual actors speak the lines helped a little bit, too.&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-SCORE: 8/10+ Awesome camerawork and set pieces create some of the most intense and memorable scenes I&#8217;ve seen in any movie in years. The sniper scene is particularly well done.+ The script paces the excitement to perfection and builds up the tension effortlessly. The tone and mood of the film are extremely, extremely effective.+ Jeremy Renner proves he can hold his own in the lead role.- The rest of the cast are just kind of &#8220;there.&#8221; Nobody else is particularly well drawn or developed.?

1252822,A3KKOJ6T4DCBDT,B00275EGWY,"technoguy ""jack""","[0, 5]","From an account by New Yorker journalist Boal,a reporter embedded with an IED unit in Iraq we get this realistic account of Bravo Company, a trio of bomb squad technicians,Sgt William James(Renner),Sgt. Sanborn(Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge(Geraghty) who have 38 days left to serve before they go home from this cycle of duty. Bigelow has crafted a series of incredibly tense moments(with accuracy) without a satisfying overall cohesion to string them together.We are done with ideology,heroics,politics,just a grounded sense of being in Baghdad,Iraq when any moment a bomb(IED) or sniper or suicide bomber can snuff you out.There is a count down of time which organises the scenes,the time they are there,the time between finding and defusing a bomb,the time it takes for a timer device to go off on an unwilling suicide bomber.Bigelow pulls off a remarkable feat with a series of 4 hand-held cameras,swivelling in all directions,and Ackroyd's cinematography.Story and plot are minimal,situation, suspense and unpredictability of event are major factors and the adrenalin pumping through Sgt James's veins.The development of the 3 main characters in Bravo's EDO is just enough to take you through each tense scenario. Eldridge runs on fear and desperation(having to see the psychologist),Sandborn wants to do things by the book, hating uncertainty and poor communication,and James often takes unnecessary risks,endangering his men.He does this by suiting up like an astronaut all the time instead of sending in the Bot,he then often takes his headset off or his suit,while doing a job,while his men scan nearby balconies or roofs.There are booby-trapped cars and blown up tankers.Every Iraqi,child or goat is a potential bomb,every mobile phone may set one they are dealing with off. Sgt James has the calmness of a psychopath while dealing with detonators and wires and yet he has a good relationship with an Iraqi boy selling DVDs or playing football.One of the best scenes is in a desert shoot-out with insurgents, emphasising duration,sweat,solidarity,especially when Sgt James gets Eldridge to clean blood out of bullets to be fired in a Barret rifle and the sharing out of drinks,the heat,the sand and the grit.The contrast is well made with civilian life at the end of the rotation when Sgt James shops for cereal in a supermarket and plays with his son,but is soon back in the field.I noticed there was not a lot of army back-up around,nor army vehicles.I know Bigelow did not get any support from the services nor funding and yet created this sense of a big subject.The disorientation of walking through rubbish-strewn streets which have been emptied and watching eyes.The emphasis is on the interaction of the characters,the macho horseplay,moments of uncertainty and reflection,and the cold,hard possibility of being blewn to oblivion.The two least likely scenes - James going off into the night to look for`Beckham's' house,and him searching with his fellow soldiers back alleyways on the outer circumference of a bomb blast to find a bomb insurgent.But, what a film...",5,"""The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction,for war is a drug""(Hedges)",1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,3089,"['account', 'New', 'Yorker', 'journalist', 'Boal', 'reporter', 'embedded', 'IED', 'unit', 'Iraq', 'get', 'realistic', 'account', 'Bravo', 'Company', 'trio', 'bomb', 'squad', 'technicians', 'Sgt', 'William', 'James', 'Renner', 'Sgt', 'Sanborn', 'Mackie', 'Specialist', 'Owen', 'Eldridge', 'Geraghty', 'who', 'have', '38', 'days', 'left', 'serve', 'go', 'home', 'cycle', 'duty', 'Bigelow', 'crafted', 'series', 'incredibly', 'tense', 'moments', 'accuracy', 'satisfying', 'overall', 'cohesion', 'string', 'are', 'done', 'ideology', 'heroics', 'politics', 'just', 'grounded', 'sense', 'being', 'Baghdad', 'Iraq', 'when', 'moment', 'bomb', 'IED', 'sniper', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'can', 'snuff', 'out.There', 'count', 'time', 'scenes', 'time', 'are', 'there', 'time', 'finding', 'defusing', 'bomb', 'time', 'timer', 'device', 'go', 'off', 'unwilling', 'suicide', 'pulls', 'remarkable', 'feat', 'series', '4', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'swivelling', 'directions', 'Ackroyd', 'cinematography.Story', 'plot', 'are', 'minimal', 'situation', 'suspense', 'unpredictability', 'event', 'are', 'major', 'factors', 'adrenalin', 'pumping', 'Sgt', 'James', 'veins.The', 'development', '3', 'main', 'characters', 'Bravo', 'EDO', 'just', 'enough', 'take', 'tense', 'scenario', 'Eldridge', 'fear', 'desperation', 'having', 'see', 'psychologist', 'Sandborn', 'do', 'things', 'book', 'hating', 'uncertainty', 'poor', 'communication', 'James', 'often', 'unnecessary', 'risks', 'endangering', 'men.He', 'suiting', 'up', 'astronaut', 'time', 'instead', 'sending', 'Bot', 'then', 'often', 'headset', 'off', 'suit', 'doing', 'job', 'men', 'scan', 'nearby', 'balconies', 'are', 'booby-trapped', 'cars', 'blown', 'up', 'tankers.Every', 'Iraqi', 'child', 'goat', 'potential', 'bomb', 'mobile', 'phone', 'may', 'set', 'one', 'are', 'dealing', 'off', 'Sgt', 'James', 'calmness', 'psychopath', 'dealing', 'detonators', 'wires', 'yet', 'good', 'relationship', 'Iraqi', 'boy', 'selling', 'DVDs', 'playing', 'football.One', 'best', 'scenes', 'desert', 'shoot-out', 'insurgents', 'emphasising', 'duration', 'sweat', 'solidarity', 'especially', 'when', 'Sgt', 'James', 'Eldridge', 'clean', 'blood', 'bullets', 'be', 'fired', 'Barret', 'rifle', 'sharing', 'drinks', 'heat', 'sand', 'grit.The', 'contrast', 'well', 'made', 'civilian', 'life', 'end', 'rotation', 'when', 'Sgt', 'James', 'shops', 'cereal', 'supermarket', 'plays', 'son', 'soon', 'back', 'field.I', 'noticed', 'was', 'not', 'lot', 'army', 'back-up', 'army', 'vehicles.I', 'know', 'Bigelow', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'support', 'services', 'funding', 'yet', 'created', 'sense', 'big', 'subject.The', 'disorientation', 'walking', 'rubbish-strewn', 'streets', 'have', 'been', 'emptied', 'watching', 'eyes.The', 'emphasis', 'interaction', 'characters', 'macho', 'horseplay', 'moments', 'uncertainty', 'reflection', 'cold', 'hard', 'possibility', 'being', 'blewn', 'oblivion.The', 'two', 'least', 'likely', 'scenes', 'James', 'going', 'off', 'night', 'look', 'Beckham', 'house', 'searching', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'back', 'alleyways', 'outer', 'circumference', 'bomb', 'blast', 'find', 'bomb', 'insurgent.But', 'what', 'film']",N/A

1252828,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B00275EGWY,The Guardian,"[0, 0]","With competition like the outstanding `District 9' and the visually stunning `Avatar' released in 3-D in 2009 (not to mention `The Blind Side'), it's difficult to understand how Kathryn Bigelow's film could justifiably be considered the best film of the year by the Academy. Life is full of surprises.The Hurt Locker of the title refers to a box of bomb parts, fuses and detonators which Sgt William James, the main character at the centre of the story, keeps under his bed. These are souvenirs of all the bombs that almost killed him, but didn't. The film has a few plus points: building of tension, the realism of the environment (filmed in Jordan with Iraqi ex-pats playing Iraqi citizens and insurgents) and conveying the lethality and horror of the work the EOD team do. However there are too many shortcomings for this to be a great film, and classic status is an unlikely future.First of all, there is no real plot or development of character and the story goes nowhere. From a straw poll of people I know who have also seen the film the audience does not easily warm to the three main players and frankly doesn't much care what happens to them. I certainly didn't. The characters are only one step beyond cardboard cut-outs.Secondly, bomb disposal teams in the real world do not risk their own lives and those of colleagues recklessly by defusing lethal ordnance by hand when small robot vehicles are perfectly capable of doing the job, as shown in the first scene - not more than once anyway, without facing serious disciplinary action. The `maverick hero challenging staid authority' theme, a favorite staple of Hollywood, is pushed to incredulity here.Thirdly, even a viewer who has not served in the military can see many of the anomalies which make the whole film look sloppy. Three guys in an EOD team repeatedly alone in a potentially hostile environment, with no supporting infantry or cover? Come on. The new pixelated uniforms are anachronistic for 2004, when the film is supposed to be set. When the main protagonist James - a serving US Army sergeant no less - hijacks a shady DVD-seller's car by holding a gun to the guy's head and orders him to drive to the house of a murdered young boy's family, well, at that point I'm afraid suspension of disbelief went too far. The whole scene was utterly preposterous, pure fantasy, unreal: the very worst of Hollywood is no less believable than this. The three's subsequent race through dark alleyways in Baghdad at night with flashlights on their helmets searching for suspected bombers (LIGHTED FLASHLIGHTS ON THEIR HELMETS FOR GOD'S SAKE!) well, Kathryn, you lost my interest. That's just plain stupid. Then the leg-wounded Sergeant Eldridge is evacuated in an ancient Vietnam-era Huey helicopter. In 2004. Yeah.Why not get these details right? It's not difficult. Because these numerous gaffes are not compensated by plot, storyline, script or anything else to hold the viewer's interest, boredom and impatience set in so that the anomalies come into sharper focus.Considering the relatively modest (by current Hollywood standards) budget the film does look gritty and real. It actually looks like Iraq. Competent direction and editing ensure the film is a white-knuckle rollercoaster of tension for much of the running time but because of insufficient episodes of light and shade the tension paradoxically starts to become monotonous and loses its edge. The hand-held camera work, used so effectively by Spielberg in `Saving Private Ryan' to convey chaotic, combat-urgent realism, is appropriate but hardly original and has been done better by others. And who were those Brits disguised as Arabs in the middle of the desert supposed to be? Mercenaries? Special Forces? We're not told. They seem to be featured to remind American viewers there are other foreign forces in Iraq and so it's confusing, and this particular crew's main function seems to be to get shot dead in the fire-fight to add to the drama.On the positive side, the film is refreshingly apolitical and does not (unlike `Avatar') preach to the audience and tell them what they should think. The political views of the writer/director are not put into the mouths of the actors, and the viewer is left to make up his own mind what he thinks about the wisdom or folly of the conflict in a broader geopolitical context.The short scene near the end of the film with James back home with his wife and young son, engaged with the banalities of everyday suburban life like cleaning leaves from rain drains and shopping at the supermarket, is understated and well, OK. However, we have no feeling of the relationship between James and his wife or why he should choose to leave his infant son and return to his lethal work in Iraq except the premise that `war/life-threatening danger is a drug, an addiction.' Yeah, profound. This could have been a rich and powerful dramatic scene if handled well but the opportunity is lost and the theme is not convincingly explored.Dare one suspect the Academy's best film and best direction awards decisions were guided by sensitivity to the essentially worthy subject matter of `The Hurt Locker' and the feeling that to pass over this film might be seen as an insult to the serving soldiers in Iraq? That to award the Oscar to Bigelow's ex-husband's `Avatar' might be seen as confirmation that Hollywood is just about escapist entertainment spectaculars and simplistic, PC-driven new-age platitudes? Maybe the Oscar was awarded to Bigelow on gender grounds to have a female director win for the first time, even though the film itself barely deserves it. We can only speculate. Not a good decision on artistic grounds because although `The Hurt Locker' is not an outright bad film, it's not very good either. A better film with this subject matter might have been made. The other major war-themed movie of 2009, `Inglorious Basterds' although containing all Tarantino's violent fantasy-comic-book excesses, nevertheless has a tight and clever plot, strongly defined characters, superlative script, wicked black humor and an outstanding denoument which puts it way ahead of Bigelow's thinner offering as a satisfying viewing experience.",3,Film of the year?

1252829,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00275EGWY,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[4, 7]","A war film unlike any other, The Hurt Locker examines a group of Army bomb squad soldiers in Iraq and the extreme toll the horrors of war and the debilitating awareness of imminent death takes on their lives. Incredibly suspenseful from the start, the pressure and paranoia to get the job done never lets up, and though the balance between realism and personalized fiction seems to shift more towards the latter further into the turmoil, few films can boast war scenes of such a gloriously intense magnitude.After the leader of an Army bomb squad unit in Iraq is tragically killed, brash-but-experienced bomb technician William James (Jeremy Renner) is brought in to replace his command. His new squad includes Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty); the trio must learn to trust each other through their various, always perilous missions, constantly coping with the daily reminders of the fragility of human life and the infinite dangers surrounding their every move.""War is a drug"" states the opening quote by author Chris Hedges. That idea isn't fully revisited until the conclusion when The Hurt Locker resorts to being a mouthpiece for soldier's mentalities, the regimentation of their lives and their inability to reinsert themselves back into the world they knew before. It seems an unnecessary effort, considering the incredible amount of raw suspense and nail-biting action that drives the majority of the film. It's a small dose of political agenda, leaving the rest to be solidly entertaining, proving once again that director Kathryn Bigelow can handle action movies like the best of them.The Hurt Locker is partly a biopic of a fictionalized EOD specialist, and part pseudo-documentary about a tension-wrought Bravo Company 40 day rotation. Instead of focusing on a story arc that separates specific villains and related events, the film chronicles several unrelated bomb missions and the tolls they have on fellow soldiers, Iraqi citizens and James' beliefs and methodology. Without catching those responsible or even hunting specific terrorists, The Hurt Locker relies on tremendously powerful imagery, adrenaline-fix recklessness, mental stresses and an obsession with death, heart-stopping explosions, camaraderie, Full Metal Jacket-influenced commanding officer execution thoughts, and enough suspenseful intensity to level a movie theater. It's borderline humorous the way Bigelow toys with the audience, setting up extreme anticipation for the next detonation or ambush, pouncing on the viewer's senses like a horror film.Being a bomb squad technician is like a roll of the dice, a high-pressure, high-stakes risk that demands a sound mind and a dizzyingly calm intelligence. There is no room for error, and actor Jeremy Renner provides a believable hero - one who demonstrates a daredevil disregard for protocol and safety that might just be a mask for a man whose perfectly-honed skills are the mark of an uncompromising professional. The supporting cast is superb, as are the sound effects and numbingly immersive camerawork. Witnessing a different side of the Iraqi war zone, a modern battlefield, coupled with real-life sacrifice and heroism is powerful, alluring, and eye-opening entertainment.- The Massie Twins",4,The Hurt Locker Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,3282,"['war', 'film', 'other', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'group', 'Army', 'bomb', 'squad', 'soldiers', 'Iraq', 'extreme', 'toll', 'horrors', 'war', 'debilitating', 'awareness', 'imminent', 'death', 'lives', 'Incredibly', 'suspenseful', 'start', 'pressure', 'paranoia', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'never', 'up', 'balance', 'realism', 'personalized', 'fiction', 'shift', 'more', 'latter', 'further', 'turmoil', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'boast', 'war', 'scenes', 'such', 'gloriously', 'intense', 'magnitude.After', 'leader', 'Army', 'bomb', 'squad', 'unit', 'Iraq', 'tragically', 'killed', 'brash-but-experienced', 'bomb', 'technician', 'William', 'James', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'brought', 'replace', 'command', 'new', 'squad', 'Sergeant', 'JT', 'Sanborn', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'Specialist', 'Owen', 'Eldridge', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'trio', 'must', 'learn', 'trust', 'other', 'various', 'always', 'perilous', 'missions', 'constantly', 'coping', 'daily', 'reminders', 'fragility', 'human', 'life', 'infinite', 'dangers', 'surrounding', 'move', 'War', 'drug', 'opening', 'quote', 'author', 'Chris', 'Hedges', 'idea', ""n't"", 'fully', 'revisited', 'conclusion', 'when', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'being', 'mouthpiece', 'soldier', 'mentalities', 'regimentation', 'lives', 'inability', 'reinsert', 'back', 'world', 'knew', 'unnecessary', 'effort', 'considering', 'incredible', 'amount', 'raw', 'suspense', 'nail-biting', 'action', 'majority', 'film', 'small', 'dose', 'political', 'agenda', 'leaving', 'rest', 'be', 'solidly', 'entertaining', 'proving', 'once', 'again', 'director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'can', 'handle', 'action', 'movies', 'best', 'them.The', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'partly', 'biopic', 'fictionalized', 'EOD', 'specialist', 'part', 'pseudo-documentary', 'tension-wrought', 'Bravo', 'Company', '40', 'day', 'rotation', 'Instead', 'focusing', 'story', 'arc', 'specific', 'villains', 'related', 'events', 'film', 'several', 'unrelated', 'bomb', 'missions', 'tolls', 'have', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'Iraqi', 'citizens', 'James', 'beliefs', 'methodology', 'catching', 'responsible', 'even', 'hunting', 'specific', 'terrorists', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'tremendously', 'powerful', 'imagery', 'adrenaline-fix', 'recklessness', 'mental', 'stresses', 'obsession', 'death', 'heart-stopping', 'explosions', 'camaraderie', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket-influenced', 'commanding', 'officer', 'execution', 'thoughts', 'enough', 'suspenseful', 'intensity', 'level', 'movie', 'theater', 'borderline', 'humorous', 'way', 'Bigelow', 'audience', 'setting', 'up', 'extreme', 'anticipation', 'next', 'detonation', 'ambush', 'pouncing', 'viewer', 'senses', 'horror', 'film.Being', 'bomb', 'squad', 'technician', 'roll', 'dice', 'high-pressure', 'high-stakes', 'risk', 'sound', 'mind', 'dizzyingly', 'calm', 'intelligence', 'room', 'error', 'actor', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'believable', 'hero', 'one', 'who', 'daredevil', 'disregard', 'protocol', 'safety', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'mask', 'man', 'perfectly-honed', 'skills', 'are', 'mark', 'uncompromising', 'professional', 'supporting', 'cast', 'superb', 'are', 'sound', 'effects', 'numbingly', 'immersive', 'camerawork', 'Witnessing', 'different', 'side', 'Iraqi', 'war', 'zone', 'modern', 'battlefield', 'coupled', 'real-life', 'sacrifice', 'heroism', 'powerful', 'alluring', 'eye-opening', 'entertainment.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

The performances were strong, the direction was decent, the script had some kinks but overall it worked for me.Now there will be a lot of Vets who will destroy this movie over technical stuff or just unbelievable plot turns.  I could even add my own: you don't key a radio next to a bomb.  Never.  When the bomb tech holds his radio up to the unfortunate Iraqi forced to wear a suicide vest, I cringed.  You don't do that.  No cell phones or radios.  Ever.  ""You're 10-2.""  Ka Boom.But it wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me.  And any movie that tries to show what our soldiers are going through is always a good thing (unless, of course, it's JARHEAD, which I didn't see but read the blistering review in the New York Post by a furious Iraqi Veteran).It takes a while but the characters start to emerge and you like the three guys the film focuses on.  Especially the ""wild man"" who discovers the one thing in life he loves.  Excellent actors like Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce make appearances.  And some sequences are very well edited for maximum suspense.Another thing that hurt this film: Hollywood politics.  Kathryn Bigelow, the director, beat her ex-husband James Cameron (AVATAR) for Best Director. I knew that was going to happen.  In a business where powerful men (like Cameron) who dump wives for younger women (like Cameron) deserve to have their comeuppance, Hollywood-style.  That dynamic, I believe, diminishes Bigelow's win.  Sadly.  Yes, it was about time a woman was honored for Best Director, but Hollywood's zeal for drama and their taste for revenge sullied her win.  It will always be there.I'm not saying she didn't deserve it...I just wish it had been under different circumstances.So I liked the cast, loved some sequences.

It shows you an aspect of war you hear a lot about but you do not see that much of - bombs that get left by the wayside and the people that have to deal with them. In it, you get to look at three people and see a lot of the motivation that pushes them forward (and a 4th character briefly - although you don't really get to know him that much). This introduces you to the adrinaline ride some people have, the fear that fuels some of the motions, and the respect that soldiers seemed to have for these people. That was something I liked about this the most - the respect portion, and the part that shows you just how much these people have to watch out for.When we start our ride we are introduced to some of the mechanics that are used in this type of war, and we also see what the bombmakers work with. A robot pulling a small cart versus a 9 volt battery hitched to artillery shells. That says a lot about the powers that are out there fighting, and the things they have at their disposal. It also says something when you see that both sides have an element in common - one that stands and that thinks and that tries to outwit the other - and you even see respect shown for each side. In one instance we see what a man that has disarmed 800 plus bombs keeps under his bed, and these things said a lot a well.I really thought the movie was thought out quite a bit in the character side of the conflicts, not to mention the things we saw happening in the other portions of the fighting.There are moving parts in the movie as well - I really thought that some of it was horrible because of the way some of the bombing was set up. The bio-bomb that we see in the movie, for example, isn't just a person wearing a belt. There is a person wearing one in part of the movie but that is just a small part of the topic. The kid thing - that was something else.You might like this if you like movies about war seen from a different angle, although the conflict portion might not be what you expect. There are bombs, people hurt, and some interesting things exposed here. But the thing that really powers this is the human element, and the ways that different people survive (and perhaps thrive) in a conflict zone. I personally liked the movie because I had read oceans of headlines about roadside bombings and I had seen stockpiles of shells being destroyed in the sands, but I had never seen things from this angle.If you expect killing on all sides you get snippets of that in some places but this is more of a mindgame being played out.

1252837,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B00275EGWY,Traveler,"[1, 2]","""Hurt Locker"" just has far too many flaws to have deserved Best Picture.I walked into the theater knowing that many with military experience had been critical of its depiction of unit tactics and deployment.  Having served in the Army myself (pre-Iraq war) I was actually fine with that part of the movie as there's an obvious logistical reason for the way it was filmed - cost and the hassle of introducing more characters than were wanted/necessary to the plot.  If the director (Bigelow) had shown an entire platoon or more accompanying the bomb disposal unit she would have also had to introduce some of them as secondary characters.  So I gave a free pass on that count.  However, I take other vets word on the use of the suit and how the bombs were diffused.  Wasn't realistic.The combat scene in the desert is also completely wrong.  The insurgents take out soldiers at almost 900 meters with single shots using AKs!  Not just no way, but no freakin' way.  US soldiers are trained to take out targets with M-16s at 300 meters and not everyone can do it.  Hitting someone at almost three times that distance in one shot  . . . NO.  Not with an M-16 and not with an AK. Meanwhile, the US soldier firing with a high caliber rifle - something actually intended for sniping - has to take several shots before he can finally hit the insurgents.  That part is possibly correct, especially if the soldier firing isn't a trained sniper.Bigelow also forces her characters to do things because her plot demands it, not because it makes sense.  This is just bad film making to make such an error.  Example: The main character tells his wife a story near the end of the movie that would have caused any normal person, especially a mother, to react with some emotion and empathy.  But instead Bigelow forces that character to act cold and distant . . . which helps set up the next action by the male lead.How did this movie win Best Picture?  ""Avatar"" certainly didn't deserve to win either.  It's ""Dances With Wolves"" via CGI. 2009 must have been one bad year for quality movies . . . or, more likely, Hollywood was unwilling to buck their ""need"" to either be popular (""Avatar"") or political (""Hurt Locker"") and just go with a solid film like ""Up,"" ""Precious"" or ""Up in the Air.""",3,"Did not deserve Best Picture (and neither did ""Avatar"")",1269475200,"03 25, 2010",2010,2273,"['Hurt', 'Locker', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'flaws', 'have', 'deserved', 'Best', 'Picture.I', 'walked', 'theater', 'knowing', 'many', 'military', 'experience', 'had', 'been', 'critical', 'depiction', 'unit', 'tactics', 'deployment', 'Having', 'served', 'Army', 'pre-Iraq', 'war', 'was', 'actually', 'fine', 'part', 'movie', 'obvious', 'logistical', 'reason', 'way', 'was', 'filmed', 'cost', 'hassle', 'introducing', 'more', 'characters', 'were', 'wanted/necessary', 'plot', 'director', 'Bigelow', 'had', 'shown', 'entire', 'platoon', 'more', 'accompanying', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'unit', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'had', 'introduce', 'secondary', 'characters', 'gave', 'free', 'pass', 'count', 'However', 'take', 'other', 'vets', 'word', 'use', 'suit', 'how', 'bombs', 'were', 'diffused', 'Was', ""n't"", 'realistic.The', 'combat', 'scene', 'desert', 'also', 'completely', 'wrong', 'insurgents', 'take', 'out', 'soldiers', 'almost', '900', 'meters', 'single', 'shots', 'using', 'AKs', 'Not', 'just', 'way', 'freakin', 'way', 'soldiers', 'are', 'trained', 'take', 'out', 'targets', 'M-16s', '300', 'meters', 'not', 'everyone', 'can', 'do', 'Hitting', 'someone', 'almost', 'three', 'times', 'distance', 'one', 'shot', 'NO', 'Not', 'M-16', 'not', 'AK', 'Meanwhile', 'US', 'soldier', 'firing', 'high', 'caliber', 'rifle', 'something', 'actually', 'intended', 'sniping', 'take', 'several', 'shots', 'can', 'finally', 'hit', 'insurgents', 'part', 'possibly', 'correct', 'especially', 'soldier', 'firing', ""n't"", 'trained', 'sniper.Bigelow', 'also', 'characters', 'do', 'things', 'plot', 'not', 'sense', 'just', 'bad', 'film', 'making', 'make', 'such', 'error', 'Example', 'main', 'character', 'wife', 'story', 'end', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'caused', 'normal', 'person', 'especially', 'mother', 'react', 'emotion', 'empathy', 'instead', 'Bigelow', 'forces', 'character', 'act', 'cold', 'distant', 'set', 'up', 'next', 'action', 'male', 'lead.How', 'did', 'movie', 'win', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Avatar', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'win', 'either', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'CGI', '2009', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'bad', 'year', 'quality', 'movies', 'more', 'likely', 'Hollywood', 'was', 'unwilling', 'buck', 'need', 'be', 'popular', 'Avatar', 'political', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'just', 'go', 'solid', 'film', 'Up', 'Precious', 'Air']",N/A

The constant threat of dying, hot and heavy bomb suits, the robots, the tempermental personalities in conflict with one another, strained lives back home, and silly officers who filter into a situation with the idea of taking charge yet have no idea what's going on, now that is entirely true to life. But it makes for a good story. The acting is really quite good and the directing is awesome. For those who like military movies or just action movies, this one is a good.",4,The Hurt Locker,1268265600,"03 11, 2010",2010,1161,"['Hurt', 'Locker', 'conflict', 'Middle', 'East', 'perspective', 'who', 'witnessed', 'fighting', 'firsthand', 'soldiers', 'elite', 'Army', 'Explosive', 'Ordnance', 'Disposal', 'team', 'tactfully', 'streets', 'present-day', 'Iraq', 'face', 'constant', 'threat', 'death', 'incoming', 'bombs', 'sharp-shooting', 'snipers', 'Baghdad', 'roadside', 'bombs', 'are', 'common', 'danger', 'have', 'friend', 'EOD', 'watched', 'movie', 'said', 'movie', 'bit', 'far', 'cry', 'how', 'really', 'operate', 'still', 'really', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'said', 'military', 'guys', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'go', 'rogue', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'hammer', 'authority', 'will', 'come', 'down', 'constant', 'threat', 'dying', 'hot', 'heavy', 'bomb', 'suits', 'robots', 'tempermental', 'personalities', 'conflict', 'one', 'strained', 'back', 'home', 'silly', 'officers', 'who', 'filter', 'situation', 'idea', 'taking', 'charge', 'yet', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'now', 'entirely', 'true', 'life', 'good', 'story', 'acting', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'directing', 'awesome', 'who', 'like', 'military', 'movies', 'just', 'action', 'movies', 'one', 'good']",N/A
1252839,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00275EGWY,Turfseer,"[9, 13]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***After reading many posts about 'HL', I've come to the conclusion that members of Explosives Ordinance Disposal (EOD) squads in the military are professionals who do a tough job well. There is nothing glamorous about being an EOD but 'Hurt Locker' is determined to give these soldiers the Hollywood treatment. Hence, one might come to the conclusion that there IS something exciting and glamorous about being a member of an EOD squad.SSgt. William James is more like a Mel Gibson loose cannon character from the Lethal Weapon series than a disciplined professional performing a difficult but routine job. Hollywood loves these loose cannon types but such a type does not really fit as a member of an EOD squad. Common sense will tell you that no EOD squad member would try and disarm an IED by going right up to it and cutting the wires with a plier. The bombs are always disposed of from a distance (as shown in the first scene with a robot--before it breaks down) so as not to endanger any soldiers or civilians in the vicinity.Quite a number of people who liked this movie felt there were too many 'quibblers'--that movies are not supposed to be 100% accurate. That's true but there should be a modicum stab at realism, especially when attempting to depict the gritty reality of the Iraq War. When an insurgent attempts to blow up a car loaded with bombs (without also trying to take out the soldiers at the scene) that seems a bit far-fetched. But to make matters worse, the car doesn't blow up even though it's totally on fire. But instead of letting the car burn (which might lead to an eventual explosion), SSgt. James puts the fire out and then disarms the bomb himself, wasting precious time and putting himself and his comrades in harms way.The EOD Squad seems to go everywhere outside their base without an escort. That would never happen in the real Army. What's more, most Army movies have interesting superior officers but not here. There's one good scene where a gung ho Colonel congratulates James for his loose cannon exploits but he's only on for a minute. There is also the Shrink who wants to see what's in like out in the field. Again, without an escort, he ends up the easy victim of an IED.The point is made that James becomes more and more unhinged as he is on the verge of completing his tour of duty. After he finds a boy dead after being tortured in a bomb factory, he mistakes him for another boy who sold DVD's to him in a marketplace. Wholly inappropriately, he kidnaps a merchant from the marketplace who he suspects of tipping off insurgents. Without regard to the consequences, he forces the merchant to drive into town and give him the name of someone who might have given the boy up. He even tells the merchant to wait for him while he goes into the house of an innocent Iraqi family but of course the merchant drives off. The whole pointless enterprise is resolved when the man's wife hits him and he runs out with a huge welt on his forehead. What's more, no one reports James when he returns, even though he's stopped and searched by sentries at the entrance to the base.Things get even more bizarre when James and his fellow EOD squad members are ordered to investigate a tanker explosion in the 'Green Zone' (how a tanker could get into the Green Zone, the most heavily protected area of Baghdad, I have no idea). Anyway, James gets the idea that this was not the work of a suicide bomber but a remote detonation near the scene of the explosion. Without a clue as to who might have been behind the crime, James orders the squad into an adjoining neighborhood where they (implausibly) split up and search for the faceless perpetrators. One of his guys is almost kidnapped but is saved only after James kills the bad guys but ends up shooting his EOD buddy in the leg. Again, James never gets into trouble for his antics and the whole incident never seems to be reported to his superiors.Despite the implausibility of many of the scenes, Hurt Locker still has enough action scenes to keep your interest. The depiction of the different kinds of explosive devices the insurgents keep coming up with seems pretty convincing (they even go as far as booby trapping the body of a boy they recently tortured and killed). While pure Hollywood hokum, the denouement, where James attempts to save an Iraqi man who has changed his mind about being a suicide bomber, is pretty exciting (again, no EOD squad member would be allowed to try and save a man in that position since such actions could jeopardize everyone's lives at the scene).While it appears that the film's scenarist did a modicum of homework finding out what's it like to be an EOD member in Iraq, he had little success in developing his characters. The interplay between James and Sgt. Sanborn was clich&eacute;d at the beginning, with the conservative Sanborn attempting to keep the wild James in check. Later the conflict dissipates and the relationship devolves into a flaccid buddy flick where the characters are reduced to enjoying themselves by punching each other in the stomach. The shaky hand-held camera technique gives the picture a documentary feel and the dialogue at times seems amateurishly improvised.Although Hurt Locker has been classified as an 'indie' film, it's really a traditional Hollywood picture. While HL doesn't shrink from showing the horrors of war, the protagonist, James, is the typical gung ho American hero that John Wayne would have probably loved. I am willing to forgive Hurt Locker for its implausible moments but sadly there isn't enough conflict generated between the principals to qualify as true art house fare.",2,Lethal Weapon meets the

1252840,A9R6Z1PMRJ0BV,B00275EGWY,Twins Daddy,"[7, 21]","Speechless! Tears flowing down my cheeks as the credits rolled! Could this cinematic MASTERPIECE have been made by someone from our own wretched planet? I think not. Kathryn Bigelow MUST have come to us from an extrasolar location, with directing talent dripping from her wings when she entered our atmosphere! As I watched The Hurt Locker, I kept thinking, ""How can one director take so many individual segments of pure fiction and have the masses falling all over themselves with glowing admiration for the 'authenticity' of this film?"" Just truly AMAZING! Most of the time even average buffoons who've never even been close to a war zone can smell a war movie's fake and contrived nature...But not so with The Hurt Locker!There are those who LOVE the Iraqi setting (but don't tell them the movie wasn't even filmed in Iraq, OK?). And this movie made me want to join the US Army! I mean, I've always liked shooting Barrett .50 cals in video games and Bigelow shows us you can be a ""former intelligence"" soldier, a current member of an elite EOD team and just pick up a spare Barrett M107 lying around and start picking off bad guys at nearly 1,000 meters...Even a MOVING target! And to think I've been wasting so much time at the range to improve my skills!?!I was also unaware that the Army had relaxed their ""rules"" so much while in a war zone...Because Bigelow again shows us how you can sneak around in a hoodie, put a pistol to an Iraqi civilian's temple and have him drive you all around Baghdad for FREE (well, like I said before, it's not REALLY Baghdad you know). This has GOT to be saving our brave soldiers a small fortune in Taxi fares! And once you see a home you like, just hop out and walk right in to someone's residence (weapon drawn) and have a look around. I'm sure they won't mind if you take a few things with you before you casually stroll back to the gate of the Base (did I mention this is supposed to be a WAR ZONE Base?). Heck, you don't even get in trouble anymore for leaving the base without a pass and you'll be right back on the job the next day!Don't like the plywood nailed up over the windows? Just tear it down so you can enjoy a little sunshine with your mortar shrapnel! Bored? Just grab your buddies and hop in the Humvee and cruise around the beautiful Iraqi countryside (well, not really IRAQI countryside). I also like how you can be given orders to investigate an explosion, but you and your buddies can grab your assault rifles and start going through the city streets ""looking for bad guys to blow away""...That's sounds so much better than a stupid video game! Just grab your M4A1 and go hunting for LIVE targets!! I mean, you're in a foreign country so nobody's gonna care if you mow down a few of the locals in the dead of night for some cheap thrills, right? Bigelow shows us this is how our soldiers respond to orders in ""THE NEW US ARMY"".Bigelow made sure I was NEVER worried about the safety of this EOD Team! Sgt James, the lead bomb tech, is nothing short of a Superhero! He's diffused, what, some 873 explosive devices? And he STILL has all of his digits? He also keeps a piece of each one under his bunk. (I hope I'm not being too picky here, but pieces of 873 bombs would probably take up HALF of the room these guys live in, don't you think?) Sgt James doesn't even CARE if he blows up! He walks up to a flaming car filled with live shells and casually uses ONE fire extinguisher to douse the flames in about 15 seconds. Then he removes ALL of his protective gear and begins grabbing the smoldering steel while slicing and ripping into the car's interior with a pocket knife, not even concerned about triggering an explosion...And why should he be with 873 under his belt? He even stands in the center of a spider IED and yanks the wires right up out of the ground! He walks up to a potential car bomber and puts a pistol to his temple (he's really good at that you know). He uses his x-ray vision to...Wait a minute. Sorry, that's Superman isn't it? In fact, the only time Sgt James fails to diffuse, none of his buddies are hurt. It's the innocent psuedo-Iraqi guy who's blown to smithereens!This Sgt James guy don't take nothing from nobody! When he gets tired of communicating with his team members, he just turns his radio off. He deploys a smoke grenade as a ""distraction"" so his team can't watch him do his magic. Later, a couple of bad guys are carrying off his buddy and he just opens up on ALL of them with his trusty assault rifle! Of course his buddy takes one in the leg that shatters his femur, but he'll be (kind of) up and walking in a few months...maybe. There's no inquiry as to WHY his buddy is crawling around with one of Sgt James' rounds in his leg. There's no inquiry as to WHY they disobeyed orders and were doing a little recreational night hunting on the streets of Baghdad. I always thought they Court Martialed soldiers for stuff like that. Bigelow show us not anymore...This is ""THE NEW US ARMY"" where there's no longer a need for any intrusive Chain of Command!Finally, I'd always been led to believe that soldiers killed in war died horrible deaths. Silly me! Bigelow shows how today's soldier can take a sniper bullet right through the chest and DIE in a beautiful 360 degree dive with a half-twist that looks like it was choreographed by none other than Paula Abdul herself...Simply a spiritual experience!!Since I have no life to speak of, I must watch The Hurt Locker again and again and again just soaking in the awesome beauty and truth that allowed me to forget about my own pitiful life and instead transcend the Earthly boundaries that usually restrict mere mortals from becoming something much, much more...I only regret my mouse-induced failure to give this movie a full 5-stars on Amazon. If I blindly give everything I review 5-stars, then everyone will give me ""helpful"" votes and I'll be invited to join the exclusive Amazon Vine community of reviewers. My mistake, huh?",3,This movie made me a better person!,1263513600,"01 15, 2010",2010,5974,"['Speechless', 'Tears', 'flowing', 'down', 'cheeks', 'credits', 'rolled', 'Could', 'cinematic',

1252841,AEE52GO98PFOL,B00275EGWY,Tyr Shadowblade (TM),"[6, 13]","EDITED TO ABIDE BY AMAZON STANDARDS CONCERNING LANGUAGE AND INSULTSMany years ago, practically in another life, I learned how to deactivate infernal devices.  Back in the 1980s EOD training focused primarily on unexploded ordinance rather than IEDs, and the stuff the IRA and PLO was putting together back then was downright primitive in comparison to some of the newfangled stuff our guys are facing now.  To put this in perspective, when I was at AIT cellphones hadn't even been invented yet.Even back in primitive times, one of the most basic and fundamental rules you learn is to consider the MANY possible anti-handling devices you might encounter.  Often, even a simple mil-spec device such as a landmine could have several anti-handling devices in place, and with an IED it could get downright devious.  I'm not going to go into any detail here, but anti-handling devices are designed to kill anyone who discovers the device and attempts to render it safe.  Any entry-level Combat Engineer knows you're not supposed to lift, roll, jostle, or shake a suspect device without a complete and detailed inspection.  The genius in this film is dragging 50 pound shells out of the dirt by their wires and prying open the trunk of a car to expose the bomb inside.  In real life, bad guys use tamper resistant bombs.  Pull it out of the dirt?  BOOM.  Open a boobytrapped trunk, hood, or door?  BOOM.  Snip random wires?  Holy collapsing circuit!  BOOM.  These were the first things you learned 25 years ago!  Today, EOD school is three times as long and you are practically qualified for an electrical engineering degree when you are done.  This idiot would have washed out halfway through the first phase.  Risktaking is one thing, foolhardy bravado is another, but what this guy was doing guaranteed him a Darwin Award.  It is glaringly obvious that no-one with any actual EOD experience was used as a consultant for this film.Wanton stupidity abounds, and to make things worse it isn't even an entertaining movie.  Unlikeable undeveloped characters, idiotic subplots that go nowhere, and no sense of reality.  Oh, I loved the scene when they are working the Barnett 50 which is a precision sniper rifle and they're sighting it in like an artillery piece, cleaning blood off the rounds to prevent it from jamming, and completely forget that there is an entire belt of ammo in the turret gun . . . but I digress.  Apparently, no-one who actually fired a gun was used to consult on this film either.  Ending sucked too.  Altogether, this was a dismal failure as a war movie.  Of course, the soulless drones in Hollywood and the Press Corps all think it is movie of the year deserving of numerous high awards.  This movie made me want to vomit.

Movies from 'All Quiet on the Western Front' to 'Inglorious Basterds' have show us good vs. evil, fancy dialogue etc. War is always taken out of context in cinema, but there are very few that give us something real.'The Hurt Locker', now known as the best picture of 2009 is one of those movies that is not bent on giving us a glorious picture, rather they strip war down to its true, gritty roots and in this movie we see the mental anguish that soldiers go through in modern day war. This movie takes us into the lives of a battalion that has been sent into Iraq to patrol the streets in search of terrorists and suicide bombers. In the middle of their rotation they are given a new squad leader that is a bit off color when it comes to the seriousness of their cause. He is unruly and at times treats it like a game. While some would consider characteristics such as this offensive because of the real people out there today fighting this war, there is some realism to those actions. There are people that have gotten so wrapped up in this war they try to turn into something else just to keep going as they battle the enemy. The film is very tense and at times not for the faint hearted. Still, it is not suppose to be war is real and war can make you feel all sorts of emotions you never thought you had inside you. One of the things that I appreciated about 'The Hurt Locker', was the fact that not all Arab people are depicted as bad, and that those who happen to be good in nature are thrown into terrorist acts against their will and sometimes they lose their own lives.'The Hurt Locker', is not meant to be a cinematic legend in its field, nor was it made to be one of the greatest films of all time. I feel this movie was created to send a very important message about the war we are currently fighting and war in general. We have brave men and women who fight for freedom and a movie such as this one is here to show us, maybe not accurately, how they go about their daily lives on the battlefield. More importantly, it shows how all that these souls want to make sure that in the end they are able to go home.",4,Something new.,1278115200,"07 3, 2010",2010,2236,"['many', 'movies', 'have', 'depicted', 'world', 'war', 'past', 'given', 'very', 'glorified', 'Hollywood', 'picture', 'Movies', ""'All"", 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', ""'Inglorious"", 'Basterds', 'have', 'show', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'fancy', 'dialogue', 'etc', 'War', 'always', 'taken', 'out', 'context', 'cinema', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'give', 'something', 'real', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'now', 'known', 'best', 'picture', '2009', 'one', 'movies', 'not', 'bent', 'giving', 'glorious', 'picture', 'rather', 'strip', 'war', 'down', 'true', 'gritty', 'roots', 'movie', 'see', 'mental', 'anguish', 'soldiers', 'go', 'modern', 'day', 'war', 'movie', 'lives', 'battalion', 'been', 'sent', 'Iraq', 'patrol', 'streets', 'search', 'terrorists', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'middle', 'rotation', 'are', 'given', 'new', 'squad', 'leader', 'bit', 'off', 'color', 'when', 'seriousness', 'cause', 'unruly', 'times', 'treats', 'game', 'would', 'consider', 'characteristics', 'such', 'offensive', 'real', 'people', 'there', 'today', 'fighting', 'war', 'realism', 'actions', 'are', 'people', 'have', 'gotten', 'so', 'wrapped', 'up', 'war', 'try', 'turn', 'something', 'else', 'just', 'keep', 'going', 'battle', 'enemy', 'film', 'very', 'tense', 'times', 'not', 'faint', 'hearted', 'Still', 'not', 'suppose', 'be', 'war', 'real', 'war', 'can', 'make', 'feel', 'sorts', 'emotions', 'never', 'thought', 'had', 'One', 'things', 'appreciated', ""'The"", 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'was', 'fact', 'not', 'Arab', 'people', 'are', 'depicted', 'bad', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'good', 'nature', 'are', 'thrown', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'will', 'sometimes', 'lose', 'own', 'lives', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'cinematic', 'legend', 'field', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'send', 'very', 'important', 'message', 'war', 'are', 'currently', 'fighting', 'war', 'general', 'have', 'brave', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'fight', 'freedom', 'movie', 'such', 'one', 'here', 'show', 'maybe', 'not', 'accurately', 'how', 'go', 'daily', 'lives', 'battlefield', 'More', 'importantly', 'how', 'souls', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'end', 'are', 'able', 'go', 'home']",N/A

Nor is there anything wrong with the acting, direction, cinematography or length. But there was one aspect that stuck out like a sore thumb, for me anyway, and that was the portrayal of the main character, played by Jeremy Renner. While he is a fantastic actor and did a great job in this film, I felt his character was one huge clich&eacute;. I mean, how typical was his persona? Have we not seen this type of hot-shot character before? The macho, I'm-so-brave-and-unconcerned-and-I'm-going-to-ignore-all-the-rules-and commands.... His whole act felt very typical and unrealistic. Clearly, he loved doing what he did, and he knew he was good at it, but again, I couldn't help but feel like I've seen his character a million times before.I'm usually not a fan of war films, but The Hurt Locker felt different, I think because it concentrated on a certain aspect of the Iraq war, or at least a certain division of it, which it made is slightly more interesting than other war films I've seen. There is not much fighting or battles, just those few tense scenes that have you on the edge of your seat, but it seems enough. For me this movie was more about the character than the Iraq war, and again, that's where my major gripe comes into play.

1252846,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B00275EGWY,V. Berk,"[0, 6]","Every year there comes a little film that blows audience and critic alike out of their seat.  These movies are often unheard of until a viewer sees the first theatrical trailer, or is told by a friend that they should give it a try.For 2009 that little film was the Iraq set military drama entitled `The Hurt Locker' directed by Kathryn Bigelow (ex-spouse of the infamously hard-headed, yet incredibly profitable special effects director, James Cameron who this same year broke his own record set by Titanic in 1997 with his 3D eye candy Avatar).  This film about a SSG William James (marvelously portrayed by Jeremy Renner) is a war film unlike any to be made before it.Sergeant First Class William James is out of place in Iraq.  He is a rebel in a system that requires precision as well as cooperation.  Perceived as a lone wolf with a death wish James suits up each day and constantly berates the advice and orders of those around him.  For William James this isn't a job: it's his life.  He doesn't fear dying in a ball of flame because that's what gets him off.  James has developed a truly unique addiction as his squad mates soon discover.William James is addicted to adrenaline; the thrill of knowing that at any moment he could be scattered in a thousand different places.Naturally this film contains multiple teeth chattering moments involving bomb diffusion, but I'm actually hesitant to call this masterpiece a ""war film"" because war surprisingly has little to do with the plot of the film.  Never once does this film decide to preach about moral of troops, brotherhood amongst soldiers, or even the politics behind the controversial war in Iraq.  `The Hurt Locker' is 100% self-contained and finely focused on its protagonist with Iraq being treated as the backdrop; no more, no less.  In my opinion a ""war film"" will focus on those issues, but The Hurt Locker doesn't even seem to acknowledge those archetypes.Bigelow directs the film in a manner that only a woman could possibly manage.  Gritty and dark, yet on the same time lapsing into what is clearly fiction The Hurt Locker is a delicate ballet of a constantly changing perspective.  While at times it strives for realism at others it will lapse into action movie style themes...but this is in no way a flaw with this movie.  The way I see this is that William James is an addict to adrenaline and the army is his dealer.  What the audience sees is war from the addict's point of view which of course makes war out almost as if it were a fantasy for James...except for the occasionally lapses in his addiction when he is forced to face the reality of his situation.Needless to say, this talented woman has come a LONG way since working with Keeanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze in Point Break.The pacing of The Hurt Locker is almost like the beating of a heart, which meshes well with the nerve rattling subject matter.  Bigelow pulls every string to make the style of this film mix with its subject material while at the same time allowing it to become an enjoyable action peace with some of the most suspenseful scenes in the history of cinema.Already many people are complaining about the realism of this movie; choosing to compare it to films such as `Black Hawk Down', `Saving Private Ryan', and even `Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket'.  Not surprisingly the people who try comparing The Hurt Locker to these Grade-A war films is like comparing apples to...watermelons.  It is absurd to compare The Hurt Locker to actual war films because The Hurt Locker belongs in an entirely separate genre.While those films are directly relating to war (politics, whether war is good or bad, brotherhood of soldiers, etc...) The Hurt Locker is a character study solely focused on a single individual who suffers from an addiction.  The fact that he's a U.S. Soldier serving in Iraq is irrelevant to the heart of this film.Face it folks, we won't see a war film that analyzes the nature of the Iraq war until U.S. troops have entirely pulled out because until then it's too hard to look over all the facts because things are still happening.  Don't come in looking for the `Apocalypse Now' of Iraq films because you'll not find anything like it until the conflict has been resolved and we've had a few years to recollect on its events.As it stands, The Hurt Locker is without a doubt the best film of 2009 with an amazing performance from Jeremy Renner and expert direction by Kathryn Bigelow.  I feel that people may not understand it now, but much like Apocalypse Now, or any of Stanley Kubrick's films I believe that this will be a film that the public shall look back on as being something unforgettable.Thankfully the Academy managed to see The Hurt Locker's value upon release instead of making a decision they would have regretted ten years from now.",5,A ballet of realism and delusion;

Scott of The New York Times described Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker,"" winner of the 2009 Best Picture Oscar, as ""visceral visual poetry."" It's all that and a bag of TNT.Best Actor nominee Jeremy Renner is the dark in Bigelow's Heart of Darkness. Renner's character is named William James, the same name as the philosopher and founder of American pragmatism. The real-world James wrote ""The Varieties of Religious Experience."" The James of ""The Hurt Locker"" undergoes a religious experience in finding his essential self in more of the same.Sandborn (played by Anthony Mackie), a bomb-squad partner of James, is changing tracks at movie's end but one wonders whether the Iraq experience hasn't disconnected his emotional wires, making such a transition impossible. The name Sandborn gives us modest hope that the soldier's essential self has been born through the Middle East experience. Whether that can be grasped and handled by Sandborn's statewide lady is another matter entirely, another movie awaiting Bigelow's production.A psychologist colonel with another appropriate name - Cambridge - shows us that Ivy Leaguers have no place in today's war-making other than pushing buttons way away from the combat theater and sharpening pencils Bob McNamara-style. Street fighters like James and Sandborn are the lions of Baghdad and that's probably at the heart of James' peace with war.Linking the founder of American pragmatism with Pax Americana is a deft commentary by Bigelow on how far the U.S. has drifted away from prudence.Sandborn's courage is a nod from Bigelow to the disproportionate sacrifices of black soldiers since America went to a ""volunteer"" globe-trotting military. The declining economic and social opportunities for most Americans (thanks mostly to the same profligate government that got us into the quagmires of Iraq and Afghanistan) makes ""volunteering"" a bit different from free will, especially for blacks.Speaking of will, Bigelow's Will James is a compelling personification of The Will as described by philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer.

1252857,AP3B615GM191G,B00275EGWY,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","As a fan of war-esque cinema, I have seen the greats: Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, First Blood, etc.  Recently, however, after watching such films as Jarhead and Brothers, I have begun to notice a phenomena in modern-day war films (primarily about the Middle East, accordingly) in which, while the action may be tremendous, the plot is very sparse and understated.  I was hoping for something different in ""Hurt Locker"", but was once again disappointed.For a quick plot summary, the events of ""Hurt Locker"" take place in Iraq and center on an elite bomb-defusing squad.  Time and time again the unit (led by an enigmatic Sergeant played by Jeremy Renner) shows up on the scene of pressure-packed situations and must work fast in order to minimize casualties and general destruction.  The effects of that constant tension are also touched on in scenes during the rare ""down time"" of the unit.Disregarding the overall message of the film for a moment, the movie created great tension and wartime experiences that I had not yet seen on screen.  You will literally feel your pulse rising and may have to remind yourself to breathe as ""Renner's"" unit goes about their pressure-cooker situations.  This is an aspect of war so crucial to the Middle East conflict that it was about time it got its ""due"" on the big screen.Unfortunately, the entire message of the film didn't come anywhere near to living up to that battlefield suspense.  Instead of presenting any riveting emotional dilemmas or character studies, director Kathryn Bigelow paints Renner (easily who was supposed to be the emotional background of the film) as such a stark portrait that it was difficult for me to feel anything towards him, whether good or bad.  Now, this isn't to say that the film is stark for any sort of lack of effort, as I truly believe that Bigelow believed she was creating high drama with Renner's character.  However, in trying to create what she believed to be an accurate portrayal of an Iraq War soldier, she didn't manufacture enough drama to really allow me to identify with the lead character.Thus, your ranking of this film will likely be determined by your feelings about the amount of ""contrived"" drama that needs to be concocted in war films.  If you like to stick with the very basics, ""The Hurt Locker"" will be right up your alley.  If however, like me, you need a little external character drama to jump-start your emotions, than you may feel a bit wanting when the end credits roll.",3,"Incredible Tension, But Sparse Plot",1271116800,"04 13, 2010",2010,2490,"['fan', 'war-esque', 'cinema', 'have', 'seen', 'greats', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'First', 'Blood', 'etc', 'Recently', 'however', 'watching', 'such', 'films', 'Jarhead', 'Brothers', 'have', 'begun', 'notice', 'phenomena', 'modern-day', 'war', 'films', 'primarily', 'Middle', 'East', 'accordingly', 'action', 'may', 'be', 'tremendous', 'plot', 'very', 'sparse', 'understated', 'was', 'hoping', 'something', 'different', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'disappointed.For', 'quick', 'plot', 'summary', 'events', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'take', 'place', 'Iraq', 'center', 'elite', 'bomb-defusing', 'squad', 'Time', 'time', 'again', 'unit', 'led', 'enigmatic', 'Sergeant', 'played', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'up', 'scene', 'pressure-packed', 'situations', 'must', 'work', 'fast', 'order', 'minimize', 'casualties', 'general', 'destruction', 'effects', 'constant', 'tension', 'are', 'also', 'touched', 'scenes', 'rare', 'down', 'time', 'unit.Disregarding', 'overall', 'message', 'film', 'moment', 'movie', 'created', 'great', 'tension', 'wartime', 'experiences', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'screen', 'will', 'literally', 'feel', 'pulse', 'rising', 'may', 'have', 'remind', 'breathe', 'Renner', 'unit', 'pressure-cooker', 'situations', 'aspect', 'war', 'so', 'crucial', 'Middle', 'East', 'conflict', 'was', 'time', 'got', 'due', 'big', 'screen.Unfortunately', 'entire', 'message', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'anywhere', 'living', 'up', 'battlefield', 'suspense', 'Instead', 'presenting', 'riveting', 'emotional', 'dilemmas', 'character', 'studies', 'director', 'Kathryn', 'Bigelow', 'paints', 'Renner', 'easily', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'emotional', 'background', 'film', 'such', 'stark', 'portrait', 'was', 'difficult', 'feel', 'anything', 'good', 'bad', 'Now', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'stark', 'sort', 'lack', 'effort', 'truly', 'believe', 'Bigelow', 'believed', 'was', 'creating', 'high', 'drama', 'Renner', 'character', 'However', 'trying', 'create', 'what', 'believed', 'be', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'Iraq', 'War', 'soldier', 'did', ""n't"", 'manufacture', 'enough', 'drama', 'really', 'allow', 'identify', 'lead', 'character.Thus', 'ranking', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'determined', 'feelings', 'amount', 'contrived', 'drama', 'be', 'concocted', 'war', 'films', 'like', 'stick', 'very', 'basics', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'alley', 'however', 'need', 'little', 'external', 'character', 'drama', 'jump-start', 'emotions', 'may', 'feel', 'bit', 'wanting', 'when', 'end', 'roll']",N/A
