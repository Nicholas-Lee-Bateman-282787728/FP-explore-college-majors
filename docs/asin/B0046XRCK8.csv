He is a greatly talented writer and I will read every word he produces.I enjoy the Tom thorne series of books.But we are discussing the Tom Thorne adaptation for TV, at the moment.Blazingly horrible. Terrible. As if a team went to work to to see if they could generate a travesty; a mis-characterization, a cartoon shadow of poor Mark's books and protagonist, Tom Thorne.Every value in this production from adaption to, casting, to mediocre to poor acting, to lead weighted direction, to dreadful sound, EVERY VALUE was BAD.How bad?Bad enough to make me grit my teeth hoping that there would be a saving element. One never showed up.Never.I will continue to seek out Mark Billingham's new book issues, and run like a thief from any further encounters with the TV adaptations.They do NOT deserve a second chance.This adaption got one star for working in my DVD player.It went downhill from there.",1,Disappointing to the extreme,1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,956,"['First', 'things', 'be', 'known.i', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Mark', 'Billingham', 'greatly', 'talented', 'writer', 'will', 'read', 'word', 'enjoy', 'Tom', 'thorne', 'series', 'books.But', 'are', 'discussing', 'Tom', 'Thorne', 'adaptation', 'TV', 'moment.Blazingly', 'horrible', 'Terrible', 'team', 'went', 'work', 'see', 'could', 'generate', 'travesty', 'mis-characterization', 'cartoon', 'shadow', 'poor', 'Mark', 'books', 'protagonist', 'Tom', 'Thorne.Every', 'value', 'production', 'adaption', 'casting', 'mediocre', 'poor', 'acting', 'lead', 'weighted', 'direction', 'dreadful', 'sound', 'EVERY', 'VALUE', 'was', 'BAD.How', 'bad', 'Bad', 'enough', 'make', 'grit', 'teeth', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'saving', 'element', 'One', 'never', 'showed', 'up.Never.I', 'will', 'continue', 'seek', 'out', 'Mark', 'Billingham', 'new', 'book', 'issues', 'run', 'thief', 'further', 'encounters', 'TV', 'adaptations.They', 'do', 'NOT', 'deserve', 'second', 'chance.This', 'adaption', 'got', 'one', 'star', 'working', 'DVD', 'player.It', 'went', 'downhill', 'there']",N/A

Such is the case for the series THORNE.  It is a high tension thriller of a series.`Thorne' is DI Tom Thorne (David Morrissey) who in the Sleepyhead episode enters an investigation into a mysterious serial killer. His first three victims ended up dead. His fourth was not so fortunate. Alison Willetts (Sara Lloyd-Gregory ) is unlucky to be alive. She has survived a stroke, deliberately induced by manipulation of pressure points on the head and neck. She can see, hear and feel, she is aware of everything going on around her, but she is unable to move or communicate. In leaving Alison alive, the police believe the killer's made his first mistake.  And it is this kind of complex story-weaving that makes this a very tense and enjoyable series. Written by Dudi Appleton and Jim Keeble and directed with panache by Benjamin Ross, the large cast includes some very fine actors - David Morrissey is at the top of the list - that includes Eddie Marsan, Sandra Oh, Lily Loveless, Neil Kelly among others.  We can only hope that this 2010 series has more parts to it and that those episodes will reach our shores and TV screens.  Definitely recommended for lovers of high mystery and thrillers.

1387941,A3NH7PYU4AD5GA,B0046XRCK8,H. Schneider,"[6, 9]","DI Tom Thorne is the hero of Mark Billingham's cop novel series from London, the stereotypical dark big city loner with the hunches (as his squad rival says: why don't you try it the conventional way and search for clues and proof?) and with the problems in team work. His cases are nut cases and serial evil, and he adds to the darkness by his own behavior.Sleepyhead was the first novel in the series and it is the first that has been turned into a TV mini series of 3 parts. We have a serial killer with medical knowledge. His victims seem to have died from heart attacks and are nearly mistaken for natural death cases. Then one victim survives, but is paralyzed. She learns to communicate by use of her eyes. She becomes a valuable witness.This could be a very good straightforward thriller, a flirt between the DI and the treating medical doctor thrown into the bargain. That plus the cop squad rivalries would have filled a normal 90 minutes film, but for a mini-series of 3x 50 minutes, the story needs to be upgraded or stretched. What we get are flashbacks into a past case, involving a dark secret that the DI shares with the gay coroner. The new case is inexplicably linked to the old one. We have a suspenseful plot with some holes and numerous clich&eacute;s.  I would have rated the film 3 stars but for the following.SPOILER: The ethical issues involved in the story are treated in a far too cavalier fashion for my taste. We are finding ourselves, literally, in the situation that we hope the DI gets away with murder. We also follow the thought process of the paralyzed victim of the killer and we agree with her that this is not the life for a formerly active young woman. We watch the doctor turn off the machinery upon the young woman's blinked instructions (like Clint Eastwood with his girl boxer). Is it as easy as that in London?The second miniseries on this DVD is case number two, Scaredy Cat. This is a rather violent case with two killers who commit serial crimes in a synchronized fashion. The police find one of the two killers fairly quickly. They find out that he is scared of his partner and asks for protection. Thorne decides to let him free and use him as bait (again, ethics!). Things go wrong, of course.All in all an interesting but questionable approach to modern city life.",3,Questionable,1296950400,"02 6, 2011",2011,2315,"['DI', 'Tom', 'Thorne', 'hero', 'Mark', 'Billingham', 'cop', 'novel', 'series', 'London', 'stereotypical', 'dark', 'big', 'city', 'loner', 'hunches', 'squad', 'rival', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'conventional', 'way', 'search', 'clues', 'proof', 'problems', 'team', 'work', 'cases', 'are', 'nut', 'cases', 'serial', 'evil', 'darkness', 'own', 'behavior.Sleepyhead', 'was', 'first', 'novel', 'series', 'first', 'been', 'turned', 'TV', 'mini', 'series', '3', 'parts', 'have', 'serial', 'killer', 'medical', 'knowledge', 'victims', 'seem', 'have', 'died', 'heart', 'attacks', 'are', 'nearly', 'mistaken', 'natural', 'death', 'cases', 'Then', 'one', 'victim', 'paralyzed', 'communicate', 'use', 'eyes', 'valuable', 'witness.This', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'straightforward', 'thriller', 'flirt', 'DI', 'treating', 'medical', 'doctor', 'thrown', 'bargain', 'cop', 'squad', 'rivalries', 'would', 'have', 'filled', 'normal', '90', 'minutes', 'film', 'mini-series', '3x', '50', 'minutes', 'story', 'be', 'upgraded', 'stretched', 'What', 'get', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'past', 'case', 'involving', 'dark', 'secret', 'DI', 'shares', 'gay', 'coroner', 'new', 'case', 'inexplicably', 'linked', 'old', 'one', 'have', 'suspenseful', 'plot', 'holes', 'numerous', 'clich', 'eacute', 's.', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'following.SPOILER', 'ethical', 'issues', 'involved', 'story', 'are', 'treated', 'far', 'too', 'cavalier', 'fashion', 'taste', 'are', 'finding', 'literally', 'situation', 'hope', 'DI', 'away', 'murder', 'also', 'follow', 'thought', 'process', 'paralyzed', 'victim', 'killer', 'agree', 'not', 'life', 'formerly', 'active', 'young', 'woman', 'watch', 'doctor', 'turn', 'off', 'machinery', 'young', 'woman', 'blinked', 'instructions', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'girl', 'boxer', 'as', 'easy', 'London', 'second', 'miniseries', 'DVD', 'case', 'number', 'two', 'Scaredy', 'Cat', 'rather', 'violent', 'case', 'two', 'killers', 'who', 'commit', 'serial', 'crimes', 'synchronized', 'fashion', 'police', 'find', 'one', 'two', 'killers', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'find', 'out', 'scared', 'partner', 'asks', 'protection', 'Thorne', 'let', 'free', 'use', 'bait', 'again', 'ethics', 'Things', 'go', 'wrong', 'course.All', 'interesting', 'questionable', 'approach', 'modern', 'city', 'life']",N/A
1387942,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0046XRCK8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","British crime novelist Mark Billingham has created a wildly popular series (nine books so far, I believe) featuring the complicated Detective Inspector Tom Thorne.  I guess it seemed inevitable, therefore, that someone would attempt to adapt them for the screen.  These television interpretations of his first two novels ""Sleepyhead"" and ""Scaredy Cat"" are certainly well constructed and well acted, but they lack a bit of the surprise factor for those that follow this type of entertainment.  Oh, blessed serial murderers!  Where would popular entertainment be without them?  Thankfully there aren't as many in real life as those that populate the pages of detective fiction as well as police procedurals in film and TV.  Imagine if there were, they would now outnumber ordinary citizens by a wide margin!  I know, especially with ""Sleepyhead,"" diehard fans of the books were upset with the liberties taken with the text.  I'm always somewhat pragmatic about these things.  I don't require an exact replication of a book on film, what a dull world this would be with zero artistic license.Sleepyhead (3 1/2 stars): In this chapter, we meet the enigmatic Thorne (well played by David Morrissey).  A seasoned professional that oftentimes steps outside of conventional procedure, he's operates as a relative loner in the department.  Thorne is haunted by a past that includes a previous run-in with a serial murderer, and so his hunches keep him attuned to unorthodox cases.  A mysterious body leads Thorne to conclude another multiple murderer might be loose.  The case breaks when a young woman is discovered alive, but she is trapped in a mental prison and completely unable to communicate or move.  Thorne, aided by his closest pal (a pathologist played by Aiden Gillen) start to believe there might be some relationship to the past.  Can they unravel these connections?  And what unspeakable conspiracy ties these two men together?  The murder mystery seems to be centered around the hospital.  But with only three possible suspects, it's not too hard to piece things together before the big reveal.What distinguishes ""Sleepyhead"" (and Scaredycat as well) is a terrific performance by Morrissey.  Even when the material feels somewhat familiar, Morrissey keeps you invested.  His scenes with Gillen (in both shows) is an absolute highpoint in acting.  Of course, the plot does require a fair amount of suspension of belief.  It's all so intricately conceived and executed (I always enjoy when the murderer is a mad genius), but then turns into a bloody public massacre (with no witnesses?) when necessary.  There is a requisite love interest in Natasha NcElhone, whose daughter just might get to close to the action.  Too convenient by far, the piece is still grounded by Morrissey and an interesting film technique that weaves the past with the present.ScaredyCat (4 stars):  Truthfully, I had deduced what was happening in this chapter in about 20 minutes.  But I also liked it better than ""Sleepyhead.""  A pair of murderers (one reticent and one gung-ho) seem to be working in tandem.  When a young boy is found to have witnessed the death of his mother, this makes it very personal for Thorne.  Early on, we discover the identity of the mild-mannered accomplice, but finding his dangerous partner poses a huge problem.  We see a bit more of the personal Thorne here (his mother has just died), and his squad has a new addition in Sandra Oh.  Oh adds a nice element of unpredictability even as a dalliance with a fellow cop seems out of left field (he is seen as happily married in the first installment and nothing is developed).  Again, though, Gillen's scenes with Morrissey are really well done.  As I said, I'd solved the mystery with hours left to go, but I still thought this was a fun ride.Both of these features should please followers of crime fiction.  There is nothing revelatory here, but the performances make it well worth the investment.  KGHarris, 6/12.",4,Serial Murderers Everywhere!
