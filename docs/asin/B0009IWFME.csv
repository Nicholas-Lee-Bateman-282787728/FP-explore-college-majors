I am not anywhere near as flexible as Ann, but even for this 58 year old non-dancer, the gentle, fluid stretches done to calming, classical music are a delight. She makes me want to dance! I am a fan of Ann's work and choose her every time over the more common exercise videos done at a frenetic pace to boisterous music. Thank you Ann for creating a soothing alternative that is so effective!",5,Gentle and effective!,1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,444,"['such', 'calming', 'effective', 'helpful', 'DVD', 'am', 'not', 'anywhere', 'as', 'flexible', 'Ann', 'even', '58', 'year', 'old', 'non-dancer', 'gentle', 'fluid', 'stretches', 'done', 'calming', 'classical', 'music', 'are', 'delight', 'want', 'dance', 'am', 'fan', 'Ann', 'work', 'choose', 'time', 'more', 'common', 'exercise', 'videos', 'done', 'frenetic', 'pace', 'boisterous', 'music', 'Thank', 'Ann', 'creating', 'soothing', 'alternative', 'so', 'effective']","Ann Smith: Stretching for Seniors-greater strength, flexibility, vitality, Easy-To-Follow, Painless, Step-By-Step, Relaxed, Over-50"

906376,AKLHGV1UODATE,B0009IWFME,D. DaSilva,"[0, 0]","I have a rib cage injury, so stretching has been a big pain reliever for me.  I love the soothing music and the graceful movements in this video.  It may be named &#34;Stretching for Seniors&#34;, but anyone who enjoys calming music, and who benefits from stretching, can benefit from this routine.  As with any exercise, common sense has to be applied, so when any of the movements hurt, or just don't feel good, trust your body and know when to stop ... don't try to reach and/or bend as far as the instructor.  When she does some of her side movements, I bend only to the point where it feels comfortable, then I stop.  I know I'm never going to reach as high, or be as flexible as Ann, but I know I'm benefiting on my own level.  I am very glad that I purchased this product and highly recommend it.",5,Love it!,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,803,"['have', 'rib', 'cage', 'injury', 'so', 'stretching', 'been', 'big', 'pain', 'reliever', 'love', 'soothing', 'music', 'graceful', 'movements', 'video', 'may', 'be', 'named', '34', 'Stretching', 'Seniors', '34', 'anyone', 'who', 'calming', 'music', 'who', 'benefits', 'stretching', 'can', 'benefit', 'routine', 'exercise', 'common', 'sense', 'be', 'applied', 'so', 'when', 'movements', 'hurt', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'good', 'trust', 'body', 'know', 'when', 'stop', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'reach', 'and/or', 'bend', 'as', 'far', 'instructor', 'When', 'side', 'movements', 'bend', 'only', 'point', 'where', 'comfortable', 'then', 'stop', 'know', ""'m"", 'never', 'going', 'reach', 'as', 'high', 'be', 'as', 'flexible', 'Ann', 'know', ""'m"", 'benefiting', 'own', 'level', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'purchased', 'product', 'highly', 'recommend']","Ann Smith: Stretching for Seniors-greater strength, flexibility, vitality, Easy-To-Follow, Painless, Step-By-Step, Relaxed, Over-50"
