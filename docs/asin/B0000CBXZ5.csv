775247,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B0000CBXZ5,JRP,"[0, 0]","Resurrection is a much better part of the mini series. You kick it off with The Rehab Team going after Robocop & Robo Cable. Robocop's system efficentcy is dropping rapidly. Rcbo Cable takes The Rehab's on by himself. Cable is fighting off Rehab's with chainsaw's & sledge hammer's. Ann R Key & her team take Robocop. Cable goes back to get Robo after he fought off The Rehab's. Then some more Rehab's attack Cable with sledge hammer's & start beating him. Then you have the introduction of the  main villain David Kaydick he attacks The Rehab Team with this tazer weapon & takes Robo Cable with him. Sara Cable has assigned James Murphy with destroying Robocop. Ann R Key & her team are fixing Robocop. Abby finds a wire that wasn't connected Robocop wants it activated Page Flectcher does a great job in this part where all the memories come flooding back. Kaydick has repaired Robo Cable but he has control over him. He put a chip in him that will fry his brain if he disobey's. Robo contacts Cable that helps Kaydick find out where they are at. Cause Jordan is Kaydick's Daughter he see he put a virus in her called LEGION & she is carrying it. He want's to unlesh it. Now at 1 time Ann, Lexx & Abby worked for Kaydick. Ann & Kaydick were Married. The Rehab's are tracking down Kaydick. 1 of The Rehab's is ran over by a semi this guy isF  U  B  A  R'd in a nice gorey pratical effect. Jordan has gone missing Ann goes to look for her she finds her outside where she is surprised by Kaydick she's knocked out she takes her & Jordan to his hideout. Cable comes in & this is a problem that I had with this part cause you have them against each other & then Cable is helping them. I know Cable is being controlled but it just didn't come off well. Anyway you have Robo, Cable Lexx & Abby battle The Rehab's when they take care of them for whatever reason Cable turrns the gun on Robo it just didn't come off right. Some more Rehab guys come in & kill Abby & Lexx. Cable leaves & goes on with Kaydick. Kaydick is going to unlesh LEGION & even thought this girl doesn't have much of a big role you feel bad for her. Robo ruins those plans however he crash's through in a car & destroy's the satillite. James Murphy followed them. You get a nice shoot out where Robocop & Cable battle The Rehab's Cable pwns The Rehab Commander he was about to fire a Cobra Assault Rifle at Cable. Cable fires his gun & blows that guys hand off good gorey pratical effect. Cable takes a sledge hammer & kills The Rehab Commander some serious ownage. Kaydick orders Cable to come with him this will lead into the next part of the mini series. Robo tells the remaining Rehab Troops to think it over & they run off. What you get next is 1 of the best moments in the franchise. James has an EMP device he's going to kill his Dad. Robo tries to tell him to think about what he is doing. He asks James what kind of Father do you think I could've been. James tells him any kind of Father would've been better than none at all. The only problem I had with this scene was when Anthony Lemke said stop calling me Jimmy. That was some questionable acting. Other than that this scene is great. I can't do it justice if you ever get the chance to see The Prime Directives it's great scene. Next I will review the final part of this mini series Crash & Burn.",4,Robocop Prime Directives review 7.5/10 Resurrection,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,3325,"['Resurrection', 'much', 'better', 'part', 'mini', 'series', 'kick', 'off', 'Rehab', 'Team', 'going', 'Robocop', 'Robo', 'Cable', 'Robocop', 'system', 'efficentcy', 'dropping', 'rapidly', 'Rcbo', 'Cable', 'Rehab', 'Cable', 'fighting', 'off', 'Rehab', 'chainsaw', 'sledge', 'hammer', 'Ann', 'R', 'Key', 'team', 'take', 'Robocop', 'Cable', 'back', 'get', 'Robo', 'fought', 'off', 'Rehab', 'Then', 'more', 'Rehab', 'attack', 'Cable', 'sledge', 'hammer', 'start', 'beating', 'Then', 'have', 'introduction', 'main', 'villain', 'David', 'Kaydick', 'Rehab', 'Team', 'tazer', 'weapon', 'Robo', 'Cable', 'Sara', 'Cable', 'assigned', 'James', 'Murphy', 'destroying', 'Robocop', 'Ann', 'R', 'Key', 'team', 'are', 'fixing', 'Robocop', 'Abby', 'wire', 'was', ""n't"", 'connected', 'Robocop', 'activated', 'Page', 'Flectcher', 'great', 'job', 'part', 'where', 'memories', 'come', 'flooding', 'back', 'Kaydick', 'repaired', 'Robo', 'Cable', 'control', 'put', 'chip', 'will', 'fry', 'brain', 'Robo', 'Cable', 'Kaydick', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'are', 'Cause', 'Jordan', 'Kaydick', 'Daughter', 'see', 'put', 'virus', 'called', 'LEGION', 'carrying', 'want', 'unlesh', 'Now', '1', 'time', 'Ann', 'Lexx', 'Abby', 'worked', 'Kaydick', 'Ann', 'Kaydick', 'were', 'Married', 'Rehab', 'are', 'tracking', 'down', 'Kaydick', '1', 'Rehab', 'ran', 'semi', 'guy', 'isF', 'U', 'B', 'A', 'R', ""'d"", 'nice', 'gorey', 'pratical', 'effect', 'Jordan', 'gone', 'missing', 'Ann', 'look', 'outside', 'where', 'surprised', 'Kaydick', 'knocked', 'out', 'Jordan', 'hideout', 'Cable', 'problem', 'had', 'part', 'cause', 'have', 'other', 'then', 'Cable', 'helping', 'know', 'Cable', 'being', 'controlled', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'well', 'Anyway', 'have', 'Robo', 'Cable', 'Lexx', 'Abby', 'battle', 'Rehab', 'when', 'take', 'care', 'reason', 'Cable', 'gun', 'Robo', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'right', 'more', 'Rehab', 'guys', 'come', 'kill', 'Abby', 'Lexx', 'Cable', 'Kaydick', 'Kaydick', 'going', 'unlesh', 'LEGION', 'even', 'thought', 'girl', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'big', 'role', 'feel', 'bad', 'Robo', 'plans', 'however', 'crash', 'car', 'destroy', 'satillite', 'James', 'Murphy', 'followed', 'get', 'nice', 'shoot', 'where', 'Robocop', 'Cable', 'battle', 'Rehab', 'Cable', 'Rehab', 'Commander', 'was', 'about', 'fire', 'Cobra', 'Assault', 'Rifle', 'Cable', 'Cable', 'fires', 'gun', 'guys', 'hand', 'off', 'good', 'gorey', 'pratical', 'effect', 'Cable', 'sledge', 'hammer', 'Rehab', 'Commander', 'serious', 'ownage', 'Kaydick', 'orders', 'Cable', 'come', 'will', 'lead', 'next', 'part', 'mini', 'series', 'Robo', 'remaining', 'Rehab', 'Troops', 'think', 'over', 'run', 'off', 'What', 'get', 'next', '1', 'best', 'moments', 'franchise', 'James', 'EMP', 'device', 'going', 'kill', 'Dad', 'Robo', 'tell', 'think', 'what', 'doing', 'James', 'what', 'kind', 'Father', 'do', 'think', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'James', 'kind', 'Father', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'none', 'only', 'problem', 'had', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'Anthony', 'Lemke', 'said', 'stop', 'calling', 'Jimmy', 'was', 'questionable', 'acting', 'Other', 'scene', 'great', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'ever', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'Prime', 'great', 'scene', 'Next', 'will', 'review', 'final', 'part', 'mini', 'series', 'Crash', 'Burn']",RoboCop: Prime Directives - Resurrection

775249,A29R3O02O0PON4,B0000CBXZ5,"Razr Maxx ""Metal Head""","[2, 5]","It seems that everywhere you look on-line to fine the DVD tech specs you get different answers.  Well, I'm here to set things straight.Despite what other R1 sites say about this title, it is issued in Anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) with English Dolby 2.0 Surround.  Surprisingly it's a good strong surround mix.  Dialogue, despite some negetive reviews of the broadcase version, is strong and easily understandable.The R2 release however appears to be in Dolby 5.1, which is ashame because the R1 could have benefitted from a 5.1 mix.  But anyway...Picture quality?  Pretty good for a TV show.  The only issue is with out-of-focus background lights.  They have that digital compression &quot;dot crawl&quot;.  But other than that, all live action and special f/x look extremely sharp and clear.Just recently bought this series in geer up for the new release of the Robocop Trilogy.  Now, I'd like to see the mid-'90s Robocop series released on DVD.  The only thing lacking in this series is the lack of use of Robo's automated targeting grid system.

While the story did not take the characters in the direction I would have liked to see, I still found it thuroughly entertaining. And yes, as other reviews have pointed out, there are times when it is obvious that the production is not a big budget affair like the theatrical releases, the writing more than makes up for that. It isn't Robocop the way you remember him, but in terms of entertainment value, it's better than Robocop 3.
