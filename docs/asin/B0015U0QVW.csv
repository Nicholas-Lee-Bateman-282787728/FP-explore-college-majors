She is sent back to Earth, and she thinks she is being sent back to stop her fiancee from seeing another woman.  She gets this idea from talking to another spirit.  The other woman played by Lake Bell is pretending to be a pyschic or someone who can speak to dead people, and eventually gets involved with Eva's character fiancee, played by Paul Rudd.Eva is funny, quick witted. I laughed a little here and there, but she commences to giving Lake's character a very difficult time by haunting her and threatening her.  Eva's character does succeed in breaking up the relationship between her fiancee and the psychic, but eventually she sees what she has done to her living fiancee is wrong.  Then at the end, Eva Longoria Parker works to get the two couple together, and there is a happy ending with the couple marrying.  And Eva's character returns to Heaven or whatever place that is feeling good about what she did.  There are always happy endings in romantic comedies, right?So, in my little opinionated world, I think I would get Eva's character better if they would have showed Paul Rudd character more with Eva's character before she died.  I didn't get their connection because the beginning before she died was so quick and only one scene.  But the rest of the film was cute with funny scenes and dialogue set up to keep your attention.

1150864,ASU5IH3CM6XXE,B0015U0QVW,ChrisTyrrell,"[9, 13]","Over Her Dead Body is the kind of movie that is both a romantic and a comedy, and people who are lonely and miserable should see this film because it will make them see what they are missing out on.  It is good-natured fun like the old-time screwball comedies that Jimmy Stewart used to be in, and even better than those.The movie Over Her Dead Body is about a man-child played by Paul Rudd who is getting married to a terrible woman played by Eva Longoria.  She is immediately killed (spoiler alert!) and he goes into a prolonged state of mourning and depression, which is where this movie takes a tragic turn.  But will he stay like this forever?  Not if his sister can help it!  So she introduces him to her psychic friend played by Lake Bell, who is always good at slapstick comedy and much better at it than the late John Ritter, even though he was also great.  Where the comedy hijinks resume is when Eva Longoria begins haunting Lake Bell to keep her away from her ex-fiancee, which is hilarious because she's completely dead.This movie is similar to Hello Again! with Shelly Long or Beetlejuice with Dick Cavett, but it is much fresher and newer because Eva Longoria is in it, and there is a lot you can learn about the afterlife, even though this is a work of fiction.  On the other hand, the comedy antics and stirring story share more in common with a movie like Antonioni's The Passenger or some of the lesser known works of a young Roman Polanski.Over Her Dead Body will charm you from beginning to middle, and then also at the end.  It reaches into your body, grabs your charm bones and heart, and gives them a good tug.  Also it will tickle your funny bone, when you're not looking.I'm not saying it's Oscar material, but it's a perfect movie to see when what you want to do is celebrate life, death, romance, movies, and angels, ice sculptures, weddings, Jason Biggs, as well as belief in psychics and a higher power, plus the joy of being alive and the hope in an afterlife, and jealousy that women can have for other women taking their man (even when they're dead!) and personal diaries, candles, and love.",4,Life-Changing!!,1210550400,"05 12, 2008",2008,2124,"['Dead', 'Body', 'kind', 'movie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'lonely', 'miserable', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'see', 'what', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'good-natured', 'fun', 'old-time', 'screwball', 'comedies', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'used', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'those.The', 'movie', 'Dead', 'Body', 'man-child', 'played', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'who', 'getting', 'married', 'terrible', 'woman', 'played', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'immediately', 'killed', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'prolonged', 'state', 'mourning', 'depression', 'where', 'movie', 'tragic', 'turn', 'will', 'stay', 'forever', 'Not', 'sister', 'can', 'help', 'psychic', 'friend', 'played', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'who', 'always', 'good', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'much', 'better', 'late', 'John', 'Ritter', 'even', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'Where', 'comedy', 'hijinks', 'resume', 'when', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'haunting', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'keep', 'away', 'ex-fiancee', 'hilarious', 'completely', 'dead.This', 'movie', 'similar', 'Hello', 'Again', 'Shelly', 'Long', 'Beetlejuice', 'Dick', 'Cavett', 'much', 'fresher', 'newer', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'lot', 'can', 'learn', 'afterlife', 'even', 'work', 'fiction', 'other', 'hand', 'comedy', 'antics', 'stirring', 'story', 'share', 'more', 'common', 'movie', 'Antonioni', 'Passenger', 'lesser', 'known', 'works', 'young', 'Roman', 'Polanski.Over', 'Her', 'Dead', 'Body', 'will', 'charm', 'beginning', 'middle', 'then', 'also', 'end', 'body', 'grabs', 'charm', 'bones', 'heart', 'good', 'tug', 'Also', 'will', 'tickle', 'funny', 'bone', 'when', ""'re"", 'not', 'looking.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Oscar', 'material', 'perfect', 'movie', 'see', 'when', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'celebrate', 'life', 'death', 'romance', 'movies', 'angels', 'ice', 'sculptures', 'weddings', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'as', 'well', 'belief', 'psychics', 'higher', 'power', 'joy', 'being', 'alive', 'hope', 'afterlife', 'jealousy', 'women', 'can', 'have', 'other', 'women', 'taking', 'man', 'even', 'when', ""'re"", 'dead', 'personal', 'diaries', 'candles', 'love']",N/A
1150865,A1E9QU27DMFRGS,B0015U0QVW,Danielle Turchiano,"[5, 9]","From Wet Hot American Summer to Clueless to The Ten, Paul Rudd usually picks oddball scripts that turn into cult hits, but unfortunately he completely missed the mark with his role as ""Henry"" in the commercial flop Over Her Dead Body.  Everything from the inane concept (a woman haunts a woman she deems getting too close to her fianc&eacute;, determined to prevent him from moving on with anyone new, one year after she is crushed by an angelic ice sculpture on their wedding day) to the distracting physical comedy going on in the background during key character moments (like when two vet techs wrestle an obese Retriever) to the physical comedy relied upon for the laughs in the forefront of the scene, as well (like the ""hot dog cart incident"") all just screamed ""over the top.""  Luckily, those screams fell on deaf ears as most audiences stayed home from Over Her Dead Body during its short theatrical run, and they will continue to go unheard as the DVD sits silently on shelves.It makes little sense why Rudd would want to try to salvage this part-slapstick, part-supernatural romantic comedy, though; perhaps he saw potential that unfortunately just got muddied during the actual production process.  Over Her Dead Body's writer/director Jeff Lowell was one of the producers on Sports Night, a show that had an equally fanatical following.  Perhaps Lowell just tried to do too much at once with Over Her Dead Body and something got lost in the translation, though, because his dialogue comes out as bad banter spoken too slowly to play out traditionally or correctly.  Rudd, of course, offers the one redeeming delivery, due to in part to his sense of comedic timing but also because of his natural, ""every man"" sensibility.Eva Longoria-Parker plays ""Kate,"" an ethereal Gabrielle Solis, borrowing a little bit of her Wisteria Lane neighbor, Bree Hodge,'s unrelentingly controlling behavior, making it hard to understand why Rudd fell for her in the first place.  The always dippy Lake Bell as ""Ashley,"" a wannabe psychic who falls for Rudd while pretending to help him get over his grief, and Lindsay Sloane as the manipulative sister who sets everything in motion, are just another example of the utterly cartoonish, unlikable characters that surround Rudd, making it extremely hard to want to immerse ourselves in his journey or root for the new couple.  When Bell lowers herself out of her normal squeak-worthy register, whether intentional or not, she actually sounds a lot like Longoria-Parker, which just makes it all the more awkward when they share a scene.Not even pop-up appearances by Stephen Root, Sam Pancake, or Wendi McLendon-Covey elicit laughs, as they are relegated to Under Five parts, getting lost in the shuffle of gags.  What would be nice to see, then, is a short featurette on the supporting players, an extended scene or deleted that featured more of them, or even a blooper reel.  The DVD offers none of that, though.Releasing Over Her Dead Body on DVD exactly three months after its theatrical release is surprising for a disc that comes completely devoid of any bonus features.  The back of the case almost reads like just another bad joke from the movie: two versions (original wide or made-for-old fashioned-TV full screen) but nothing else.  There certainly wasn't such a high demand of fans wanting to view it over and over that they had to rush the release, though it has come to be expected that all movies are released for home viewing pleasure, so it's as if the studio knew no one would scoop this one up (let alone want to spend addition time watching extras) and therefore just didn't want to expend any additional energy.  Are there hidden Easter eggs somewhere?  Is a re-release--a special, two-disc, ""Eternal Edition""-- impending?  No one will care enough to go hunting.",2,Out of this World...

I'm a big fan of Rudd's and he's very discriminating in the projects he participates in so I was intrigued.  Not surprising Rudd delivers his usual effective self-deprecating work.  The real eye-opener was Lake Bell who gives a refreshingly wholesome and funny account of a psychic who is in love with Rudd's character.  This was promoted as a vehicle for ""Desperate Housewives"" Eva Longoria who is quite good but this is more of an ensemble piece.

Its actually very funny! The comic timing is pretty good coming from all the actors. Paul Rudd who is good in pretty much anything, Lake Bell (Newcomer, I'm assuming, as I've never seen her in anything else) was really very good and I hope to see her in the future.However...I was really disappointed in Eva Longoria here. I'm a huge fan of Desperate Housewives and Gabrielle is definitely one of my favorite characters, so I expected a lot from her. Her performance was only so-so...for the small amount of time shes actually in the movie. At times I felt that she could just lift right out, the whole story of her dying really doesn't seem needed somehow. They give us really no reason to care about her at all. She, in no way, carries this movie as the previews lead us to believe. They could have done a re-write and had the entire thing surround Ashley and Henry...probably would have made for a better movie overall.I felt the same about the Jason Biggs character...he has his own little ""revelation"" in the movie that was just REALLY not needed. Seemed very forced just so he could end up with a certain someone...Anyway! Despite all the problems...the bad pacing, the under developed characters, the cheap and just bad opening credits, the trying too hard to be clever and somewhat unnecessary plot, the sort of anti-climactic ending, the horrible and cheap bare bones DVD release...I enjoyed it a lot.

Kate died on her wedding day, and came back as a ghost to drive the girl who liked her husband insane. Eva Longoria played the character Kate who was hilarious. She really did a lot of funny things in the movie, but also she showed how sad she was to see her husband without her. In the end though Kate (Eva Longoria) realized what she had to fix so she could go to heaven. I really liked that because she made her husband Henry (Paul Rudd) who was depressed happy again. This movie is one of  my favorite movies because it shows how to move on and make everyone happy. I think that is a really good thing because if you don't move on you can make yourself sad. Paul Rudd who played Henry Kate's husband was really good because he showed how he was moving on but still really cared about Kate. The husband in the movie really showed emotion. The girl who liked Allison's husband Lake Bell who played Ashley was funny, because she showed feelings and reality to be freaked out by Kate. The reason why Kate freaked her out was because Kate (Eva Longoria) was invisible to everyone but Ashley (Lake Bell). That part was really funny to watch, because Lake Bell looked crazy trying to talk to some one who no one could see. Eva Longoria, Paul Rudd, Lake Bell and every one else in the movie really did a terrific job. The movie was super hilarious and I think you should see it, especially if you love silly movies.

Indeed, ""Over Her Dead Body"" is so thoroughly inept and unfunny that it's hard to know where exactly Lowell thought he was going with it.  Virtually every  set-up, joke and sight gag in the film is flat-footed and poorly executed, with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their predicament.  How else to explain the halfhearted, lifeless performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles?I choose not to blame the actors, some of whom have proven their talents in better vehicles in the past (that is particularly the case with Rudd).  But Lowell and those studio execs sure have some `splainin' to do.",2,another lame romantic fantasy,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,1916,"['So', 'bride', 'see', 'crushed', 'death', 'statue', 'day', 'wedding', 'Then', 'get', 'year', 'later', 'former', 'fiance', 'love', 'beautiful', 'psychic', 'then', 'beautiful', 'psychic', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'disgruntled', 'dead', 'bride', 'who', 'keep', 'stealing', 'boyfriend', 'll', 'be', 'hilarious', 'Polite', 'chuckling.This', 'like', 'envision', 'how', 'Jeff', 'Lowell', 'man', 'who', 'dreamed', 'up', 'Dead', 'Body', 'presented', 'concept', 'studio', 'execs', 'there', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'big', 'mystery', 'how', 'very', 'same', 'corporate', 'bigwigs', 'could', 'then', 'turn', 'right', 'green', 'light', 'project', 'allowing', 'Lowell', 'direct', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'write', 'screenplay.For', 'think', 'movie', 'could', 'ever', 'possibly', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'original', 'premise', 'sounds', 'then', 'clearly', 'have', 'think', 'coming', 'only', 'way', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'writer', 'had', 'simply', 'gone', 'crazy', 'turned', 'no-holds-barred', 'satirical', 'farce', 'Instead', 'wanting', 'ensure', 'delivered', 'fuzzy', 'inoffensive', 'warmhearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Lowell', 'boring', 'half-measures', 'step', 'way', 'tamping', 'down', 'absurdity', 'favor', 'drab', 'conventionality', 'Indeed', 'Dead', 'Body', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'inept', 'unfunny', 'hard', 'know', 'where', 'exactly', 'Lowell', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'Virtually', 'set-up', 'joke', 'sight', 'gag', 'film', 'flat-footed', 'poorly', 'executed', 'even', 'actors', 'seemingly', 'aware', 'predicament', 'How', 'else', 'explain', 'halfhearted', 'lifeless', 'performances', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Eva', 'Langoria', 'Parker', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'various', 'roles', 'choose', 'not', 'blame', 'actors', 'whom', 'have', 'proven', 'talents', 'better', 'vehicles', 'past', 'particularly', 'case', 'Rudd', 'Lowell', 'studio', 'execs', 'sure', 'have', 'splainin', 'do']",N/A
