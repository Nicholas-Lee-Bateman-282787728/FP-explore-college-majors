1613946,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,B00AMSLDX8,J. Michael Click,"[0, 0]","Back in the late 1980's and early 1990's, Michael Douglas' name was synonymous with sexual catastrophe; no other American male actor has ever suffered the kinds of erotic trauma onscreen as he did during the period from 1987 to 1994.  During those years, his entire existence was threatened by an obsessive one night stand (""Fatal Attraction""), he became involved with a narcissistic bisexual murder suspect (""Basic Instinct""), and he was sexually harassed by a former lover who became his boss (""Disclosure"").  No wonder Douglas' name on a marquee made a lot of men squirm uncomfortably during that period!Now two of those films have been packaged together in a two disc blu-ray double feature.  The best of the pair is undoubtedly ""Fatal Attraction"", which struck a major nerve in American culture at the time of its release.  In an Oscar-nominated performance, Glenn Close plays a sexually aggressive woman who actively pursues married man Douglas.  She's in control of the seduction, dominating him completely; but when their casual fling is over, she becomes a rejected predator obsessed with possessing him at any cost.  She manipulates his conscience, invades his home, damages his property, and threatens to destroy his family.  Two very different endings were filmed, both of which are presented on this blue ray disc, along with a series of featurettes, a commentary by director Adrian Lyne, and the original theatrical trailer.  In addition to the honor accorded Glenn Close, the film received five other Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Anne Archer), Original Screenplay, and Film Editing.  The blu-ray presentation of this ""must-see"" movie is flawless.  Very highly recommended.The second feature, ""Disclosure"", hasn't aged very well.  The core of the story, in which a man (Douglas, who else?) is sexually harassed on the job by a former lover (Demi Moore) who is now his boss, is still fairly intriguing.  However, it's tied to a subplot involving a new computer technology that is dated and uninteresting.  Imagine a movie that makes a big deal of receiving an email!  The cast, which also includes such powerful actors as Donald Sutherland, Dennis Miller, Rosemary Forsyth, and Dylan Baker is generally outstanding.  The exception is Ms. Moore, who occasionally overplays her scenes; director Barry Levinson should have reminded her that a little subtlety can add nuance and shading to a character, particularly when that character is already the center of the audience's attention.  Despite these weaknesses, the film is still work a look-see, and it looks very good on blu-ray.  The only extra is the film's original theatrical trailer.  Recommended.Overall, this is a great double feature offering, especially for fans of Michael Douglas and those who are curious about American sexual mores during the end of the 20th century.  Worth the price for ""Fatal Attraction"" alone; consider ""Disclosure"" a nice little bonus feature.",4,Michael Douglas and the Sexual Mishaps of the American Male,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,2985,"['Back', 'late', '1980', 'early', '1990', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'name', 'was', 'synonymous', 'sexual', 'catastrophe', 'other', 'American', 'male', 'actor', 'ever', 'suffered', 'kinds', 'erotic', 'trauma', 'onscreen', 'did', 'period', '1987', '1994', 'years', 'entire', 'existence', 'was', 'threatened', 'obsessive', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'became', 'involved', 'narcissistic', 'bisexual', 'murder', 'suspect', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'was', 'sexually', 'harassed', 'former', 'lover', 'who', 'became', 'boss', 'Disclosure', 'wonder', 'Douglas', 'name', 'marquee', 'made', 'lot', 'men', 'squirm', 'uncomfortably', 'period', 'Now', 'two', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'packaged', 'together', 'two', 'disc', 'blu-ray', 'double', 'feature', 'best', 'pair', 'undoubtedly', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'struck', 'major', 'nerve', 'American', 'culture', 'time', 'release', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'sexually', 'aggressive', 'woman', 'who', 'actively', 'married', 'man', 'Douglas', 'control', 'seduction', 'dominating', 'completely', 'when', 'casual', 'fling', 'rejected', 'predator', 'obsessed', 'possessing', 'cost', 'conscience', 'home', 'damages', 'property', 'destroy', 'family', 'Two', 'very', 'different', 'endings', 'were', 'filmed', 'are', 'presented', 'blue', 'ray', 'disc', 'series', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'director', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'addition', 'honor', 'accorded', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'film', 'received', 'five', 'other', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Director', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'Original', 'Screenplay', 'Film', 'Editing', 'blu-ray', 'presentation', 'must-see', 'movie', 'flawless', 'Very', 'highly', 'recommended.The', 'second', 'feature', 'Disclosure', ""n't"", 'aged', 'very', 'well', 'core', 'story', 'man', 'Douglas', 'who', 'else', 'sexually', 'harassed', 'job', 'former', 'lover', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'who', 'now', 'boss', 'still', 'fairly', 'intriguing', 'However', 'tied', 'subplot', 'involving', 'new', 'computer', 'technology', 'dated', 'uninteresting', 'Imagine', 'movie', 'big', 'deal', 'receiving', 'email', 'cast', 'also', 'such', 'powerful', 'actors', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'Rosemary', 'Forsyth', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'generally', 'outstanding', 'exception', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'who', 'occasionally', 'scenes', 'director', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'should', 'have', 'reminded', 'little', 'subtlety', 'can', 'add', 'nuance', 'shading', 'character', 'particularly', 'when', 'character', 'already', 'center', 'audience', 'attention', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'still', 'work', 'look-see', 'very', 'good', 'blu-ray', 'only', 'extra', 'film', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Recommended.Overall', 'great', 'double', 'feature', 'offering', 'especially', 'fans', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'American', 'sexual', 'mores', 'end', '20th', 'century', 'price', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'alone', 'consider', 'Disclosure', 'nice', 'little', 'bonus', 'feature']",Disclosure / Fatal Attraction
1613947,A29X9U79LWG6YT,B00AMSLDX8,"OBEONECANOBI ""JEORGE""","[0, 0]","Blue Ray with two good movies in it and for the price, you can's beat that!!. I had seen these movies before already. Michael Douglas does a good job in both, but especially playing the victim as a person accused of ""sexual harassment"" by his new boss, Demi Moore whom is also good at her roll. Good suspense movie and good story when you almost never hear the man is the one being sexually harass at the job, you always hear it when is a woman. As to Fatal Attraction, well, Glen Close co-starring in this one with Michael, playing the obsessed woman that she became after what he thought would be a one night fling for the both of them, turned into a nightmare! especially when he thought, that's what she had agreed it would be. Glen Close, really gets into her role in this one and she is really good at playing the ""villain"" here, although in her mind she believes to be the victim.  This one could almost be called a classic!. I recommend them both. They both had good scripts and good direction, not to say ""good acting""Enjoy!",4,Two good Movies By Michael Douglas,1381449600,"10 11, 2013",2013,1033,"['Blue', 'Ray', 'two', 'good', 'movies', 'price', 'can', ""'s"", 'beat', 'had', 'seen', 'movies', 'already', 'Michael', 'Douglas', 'good', 'job', 'especially', 'playing', 'victim', 'person', 'accused', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'new', 'boss', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'whom', 'also', 'good', 'roll', 'Good', 'suspense', 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'when', 'almost', 'never', 'hear', 'man', 'one', 'being', 'sexually', 'harass', 'job', 'always', 'hear', 'when', 'woman', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'well', 'Glen', 'Close', 'co-starring', 'one', 'Michael', 'playing', 'obsessed', 'woman', 'became', 'what', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'night', 'fling', 'turned', 'nightmare', 'especially', 'when', 'thought', 'what', 'had', 'agreed', 'would', 'be', 'Glen', 'Close', 'really', 'role', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'playing', 'villain', 'here', 'mind', 'be', 'victim', 'one', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'called', 'classic', 'recommend', 'had', 'good', 'scripts', 'good', 'direction', 'not', 'say', 'good', 'acting', 'Enjoy']",Disclosure / Fatal Attraction
