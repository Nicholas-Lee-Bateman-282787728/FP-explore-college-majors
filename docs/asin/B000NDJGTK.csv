Jason Bateman (Arrested Development, Smokin' Aces) is absolutely hilarious as the ex with a hidden dark side.Lucian Maisel's trick alone is worth watching the movie for.

1056506,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000NDJGTK,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","When a film stars a slew of respectable actors and or comedians and or celebrities you kind of hope and pray that the film is going to be good; right?  You hear the name Jason Bateman and you think of that subtle humor that coats his serious tone and you get kind of excited about what he'll do with his role.  You hear the name Amanda Peet and you recall her scene stealing work in `The Whole Nine Yards' and dream of her capitalizing on that shining moment of brilliance.  You hear the name Mia Farrow and you think `OMG, ACTRESS' because she is, like, the definition of one.  You hear the name Zach Braff and you think of `Scrubs' and the fact that he carries that show on his shoulders with his spin on the whole `man-child' theatrics.  You hear the name Amy Poehler and you think of her hilarious SNL skits, or Amy Adams and her dynamic knack for creating layered comedic characters.  In less rambling terms; you see all those names on the front of this DVD and you expect a sleeper hit.If you expected that then you would be DEAD wrong.The film is barely funny (I thought MAYBE one or two scenes were funny) and in the end it is insultingly predictable and somewhat (ok, a lot what) preposterous.  It was like the filmmakers (screenwriter, whatever) got stumped by his own formula and decided to just throw every possible logistics he attempted to create out the window.  I mean, the whole character that is Chip is a complete waste of time and energy, and that character was handed to Jason Bateman!!!WHY?!?!?!?!Yuck; this movie is so incredibly stupid I want to beat my face against a wall for wasting the time reviewing it (not really, but almost).Anyways, I don't even know if it's worth the time, but I'm bored so get a whiff of the plot.  You have Tom and Sophia who are married and in love and have a baby.  Tom can't hold a job, and Sophia (who has a successful legal career) has decided to put her career on hold to raise their new baby.  Tom, recently jobless, accepts an offer to work at an add agency with Sophia's father.  The agency is weird and eccentric (unbelievably so) and so obviously Tom is out of place.  Then Tom meets Chip, a wheelchair bound middle aged jerk who once slept with Sophia and (creepily) makes his affections known for her every way he can.  Surprisingly (or should I say, clich&eacute;d-like) no one by Tom even notices all the blatantly obvious ways with which Chip proves himself a total creep.Of course, the whole world loves Chip, Tom comes inches from losing his wife, and then instantaneously the world realizes Chip is not what he says he is, he gives up his charade without even a fight and Tom is the world's biggest hero.This movie is retarded.",1,Break up with this movie; fast!,1294963200,"01 14, 2011",2011,2699,"['When', 'film', 'slew', 'respectable', 'actors', 'comedians', 'celebrities', 'kind', 'hope', 'pray', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'right', 'hear', 'name', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'think', 'subtle', 'humor', 'serious', 'tone', 'get', 'kind', 'excited', 'what', ""'ll"", 'do', 'role', 'hear', 'name', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'recall', 'scene', 'stealing', 'work', 'Whole', 'Nine', 'Yards', 'dream', 'capitalizing', 'shining', 'moment', 'brilliance', 'hear', 'name', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'think', 'OMG', 'ACTRESS', 'definition', 'one', 'hear', 'name', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'think', 'Scrubs', 'fact', 'show', 'shoulders', 'spin', 'whole', 'man-child', 'theatrics', 'hear', 'name', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'think', 'hilarious', 'SNL', 'skits', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'dynamic', 'knack', 'creating', 'layered', 'comedic', 'characters', 'less', 'rambling', 'terms', 'see', 'names', 'front', 'DVD', 'expect', 'sleeper', 'hit.If', 'expected', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'DEAD', 'wrong.The', 'film', 'barely', 'funny', 'thought', 'MAYBE', 'one', 'two', 'scenes', 'were', 'funny', 'end', 'insultingly', 'predictable', 'somewhat', 'ok', 'lot', 'what', 'preposterous', 'was', 'filmmakers', 'screenwriter', 'got', 'stumped', 'own', 'formula', 'decided', 'just', 'throw', 'possible', 'logistics', 'attempted', 'create', 'out', 'window', 'mean', 'whole', 'character', 'Chip', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'energy', 'character', 'was', 'handed', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'WHY', 'Yuck', 'movie', 'so', 'incredibly', 'stupid', 'want', 'beat', 'face', 'wall', 'wasting', 'time', 'reviewing', 'not', 'really', 'almost', '.Anyways', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'time', ""'m"", 'bored', 'so', 'get', 'whiff', 'plot', 'have', 'Tom', 'Sophia', 'who', 'are', 'married', 'love', 'have', 'baby', 'Tom', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'job', 'Sophia', 'who', 'successful', 'legal', 'career', 'decided', 'put', 'career', 'hold', 'raise', 'new', 'baby', 'Tom', 'recently', 'jobless', 'offer', 'work', 'add', 'agency', 'Sophia', 'father', 'agency', 'weird', 'eccentric', 'unbelievably', 'so', 'so', 'obviously', 'Tom', 'place', 'Then', 'Tom', 'meets', 'Chip', 'wheelchair', 'middle', 'aged', 'jerk', 'who', 'once', 'slept', 'Sophia', 'creepily', 'affections', 'known', 'way', 'can', 'Surprisingly', 'should', 'say', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd-like', 'one', 'Tom', 'even', 'blatantly', 'obvious', 'ways', 'Chip', 'total', 'creep.Of', 'course', 'whole', 'world', 'Chip', 'Tom', 'inches', 'losing', 'wife', 'then', 'instantaneously', 'world', 'Chip', 'not', 'what', 'up', 'charade', 'even', 'fight', 'Tom', 'world', 'biggest', 'hero.This', 'movie', 'retarded']",The Ex

Garden State and The Last Kiss were both amazing movies but I wanted to see him play a character like JD from Scrubs. You know, the kinda wacky, really funny, guy. Enter The Ex.In no way is this the greatest or funniest movie you'll ever see, let's get that straight right now. And honestly, your enjoyment of this movie will probably be based solely on whether you like Zach Braff or Jason Bateman since they're the primary characters. Everything about this movie is predictable, there's no surprises and I think that that's one of the best things about The Ex. It doesn't try to be something it isn't. However, there isn't that tired 'boy gets girl/boy loses girl/boy gets girl back' scenario which is a good thing.Tom (Braff) and wife, Sofia (Peet), move to Ohio after their son is born to try and start anew, thanks to a job offer from Sofia's dad. That's when Tom meets Chip (Bateman), a handicapped guy who is gonna be acting as his mentor at the new job. You can guess what happens next and probably be right.The thing that keeps The Ex funny throughout is far and away Tom and Chip's fued. I'm sure that's why everyone who heard about this movie wanted to see it, and it's just as funny as I thought it'd be. Now you may think differently. Past that, there are some memorable scenes, but only fans of the actors in it are gonna remember this film.

1056508,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B000NDJGTK,Brian A. Schar,"[0, 1]","On paper, this is one of the best movies ever.  Jason Bateman?  Zack Braff?  Amy Poehler?  Amanda Peet?  Paul Rudd?  And Charles Grodin and Mia Farrow for good measure - how can this not be great?And yet, ""The Ex"" is not great; it is not even OK, but instead is a lifeless dud.  The first scene sets the mood - an awful, clunky bit of exposition that doesn't even rise to the level of bad TV comedy.  This is bad news, given that Braff is the star of one of TV's best comedies, and Peet was fantastic in the underrated comedy/drama ""Studio 60"".  It just gets worse from there.  I think I was 10 minutes into this before I even chuckled.  The cast tries gamely to work with the terrible script and nonexistent direction, generally to no avail.  Grodin and Farrow fare the best, perhaps because their years of experience has taught them how to deal with clueless directors.The lighting and camera work are public-access-TV level bad.  I know because I have made movies for public access TV.  I had something on the order of a benjamin to work with.  I don't know how you get the same look with millions of dollars behind you.The funniest bits of this movie are in the blooper reel in the special features - where the actors actually get to exercise their talents for comedy without being shackled by horrible writing and nonexistent direction.As an aside, I didn't buy the crazy moms' group in Columbus, Ohio, until my wife reminded me that her best friend (who happens to live in Columbus) had virtually the same experience as Amanda Peet.The entire talented cast is completely wasted in this sad misfire.

1056509,AJIU6QI0TYSH7,B000NDJGTK,"Caitlin D. Neely ""BellaOnline Comedy Movies S...","[0, 0]","The Ex (directed by Jesse Peretz) is a romantic comedy that induces a few chuckles but ultimately doesn't do its talented cast justice.Tom Reilly (Zach Braff) is a slacker who can't find a career he loves. When he loses his job as chef the day his wife, Sofia Kowalski (Amanda Peet), has their baby, he is forced to move from New York City to small town Ohio. He reluctantly takes a job at an ad agency where her father (Charles Grodin) works. He meets Chip Sanders (Jason Bateman); a self-absorbed creative consultant who knew Sofia in high school and has an unhealthy crush on her. Tom must learn to survive in the corporate world and against Chip who becomes a rival at work and in his personal life.The humor is average at best. There are a few moments that are funny but most of the writing lets the cast down. Zach Braff, Amanda Peet and Jason Bateman are talented comedic actors. Even they cannot save this movie from its own mediocre writing.Braff's character is very one-dimensional. He does redeem himself when he his taking care of his son but most of the time he acts like a screw up who can't get his act together. The ending is promising for his character, though. It makes me believe he might finally get some thing right. But I'm not holding my breath.Chip Sanders is as evil of a corporate rival as they get. He is sadistic, cruel and there are no qualities in his personality that compels me to like him. I feel this also makes Sanders appear one-dimensional. It would be interesting for him to reveal anything that garners sympathy.Amy Adams, Fred Armisen, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd are all delightful actors that pop up in the movie. Poehler was great. She leaves me wondering why her character doesn't show up more. She is hilarious with the lines she is given (as are the rest of them). Any excuse to give Poehler more lines and air time would make me happy.",3,Even its talented cast cannot save this movie's mediocre writing from stumbling all over the place,1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,1880,"['Ex', 'directed', 'Jesse', 'Peretz', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'few', 'chuckles', 'ultimately', ""n't"", 'do', 'talented', 'cast', 'justice.Tom', 'Reilly', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'slacker', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'career', 'When', 'job', 'chef', 'day', 'wife', 'Sofia', 'Kowalski', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'baby', 'forced', 'move', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'small', 'town', 'Ohio', 'reluctantly', 'job', 'ad', 'agency', 'where', 'father', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'Chip', 'Sanders', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'self-absorbed', 'creative', 'consultant', 'who', 'knew', 'Sofia', 'high', 'school', 'unhealthy', 'crush', 'Tom', 'must', 'learn', 'survive', 'corporate', 'world', 'Chip', 'who', 'rival', 'work', 'personal', 'life.The', 'humor', 'average', 'best', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'are', 'funny', 'most', 'writing', 'cast', 'down', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'are', 'talented', 'comedic', 'actors', 'Even', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'movie', 'own', 'mediocre', 'writing.Braff', 'character', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'redeem', 'when', 'taking', 'care', 'son', 'most', 'time', 'screw', 'up', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'act', 'together', 'ending', 'promising', 'character', 'though', 'believe', 'might', 'finally', 'get', 'thing', 'right', ""'m"", 'not', 'holding', 'breath.Chip', 'Sanders', 'evil', 'corporate', 'rival', 'get', 'sadistic', 'cruel', 'are', 'qualities', 'personality', 'compels', 'like', 'feel', 'also', 'Sanders', 'appear', 'one-dimensional', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'reveal', 'anything', 'garners', 'sympathy.Amy', 'Adams', 'Fred', 'Armisen', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'are', 'delightful', 'actors', 'pop', 'up', 'movie', 'Poehler', 'was', 'great', 'wondering', 'why', 'character', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'more', 'hilarious', 'lines', 'given', 'are', 'rest', 'excuse', 'give', 'Poehler', 'more', 'lines', 'air', 'time', 'would', 'make', 'happy']",The Ex

His other features are ""First Love, Last Rites"" & ""The Chateau.""  This has to be one of the least funny DVDs I've seen.  Amanda Peet is apparently in love with her husband, although she sends out no emotional signals other than her dialogue.  Zach Braff is famous for ""Scrubs"" TV series, ""Garden State"" & ""The Last Kiss.""  As Tom in this movie, he's about the least intelligent person on the planet.  When he tries to get Wesley's help and assaults him, no one but a child abuser could continue to root for his character.  Jason Bateman who was in ""The Break Up"" and ""Mr. Margorium's Wonder Emporium,"" is also one of the worst villains by trying to score points by faking paraplegia, apparently successfully according to the plot.  Charles Grodin looks so much like Amanda Peet that she must have been adopted.  Mia Farrow doesn't do much in this film, but is more interesting that most.  Wesley, the neighborhood boy who can down a burger in a bite, is played by newcomer Lucien Maisel.

There he's made subordinate to an old flame (Donal Logue) of his wife (Amanda Peete) who has been living as a pretend paraplegic in a wheelchair for sympathy. Logue's objective is to drive Zach out of the company and take back up with Amanda; en route he sabotages Zach's new ad campaign idea, and Zach accidentally starts a fire destroying the tape with the compelling ad approach just when it's needed most. To make matters worse, the kid in the ad decides he's not going to record it anymore. The resulting stress causes Zach and Amanda to break up.Fortunately, despite several additional klutzy moves, Logue exposes himself as an impostor, and goes off to a supposed new position in Barcelona that Zach fakes a job offer to him from.

This one was originally marketed under the name of ""Fast Track"" (the defunct title also shows up in the end credits -- whoops!), indicating that it's about the hijinks to be found in the corporate zeitgeist.  Then the name was changed, ostensibly to draw focus to the alpha male struggle that makes up much of the plot.Such card-swapping doesn't make much difference.  This movie, by any other name, would smell just as stanky.  Zach Braff, donning a personality as interesting as acetate, plays Tom Reilly, a recently fired chef who gets a job at his father-in-law's advertising agency.  Also employed there?  His wife's sorta-kinda-ex-boyfriend, Chip, who also happens to be a passive-aggressive wheelchair-bound jerk.So, let's see ... the advertising milieu means lots of commercial gags, we have an upwardly-mobile careerwoman stuck playing homemaker in suburban Ohio (""Look at all the white people,"" Tom says when they first drive into town), Tom is working for his father-in-law (a wealth of material there, even if it is dusty), and look at that cast!  Zach Braff, Amanda Peet, Jason Bateman, Charles Grodin, Mia Farrow, Donal Logue, Amy Poehler, Fred Armisen, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco.  I love all those folks!  On paper, this looks like it has the potential to be a great movie.Maybe they should've written some more stuff on that paper, though.  Like a coherent plot, or funny jokes, or creative character struggles, for example.  Instead, we have pratfall after pratfall, lots of ""cripple jokes,"" and a kid who can swallow an entire hamburger without chewing once.Braff and Peet play it straight to an entire cadre of wack-jobs (Sofia attends New Age Baby Classes where moms ask their infants for permission to pick them up; Tom's co-workers toss around a pretend ""teamwork"" ball and aren't allowed to say ""I'm sorry"" unless in writing), but none of these weirdos is given much room to stretch.  Of all the talent in the film, only Grodin's father-in-law Bob comes the closest to making an impression.It's not his fault.  The script needs multiple doctors.  Chip sabotages Tom every chance he can get, but instead of calmly explaining his predicament to his family and friends, Tom pulls the classic screwball comedy move of fighting fire with fire, making himself look jealous, insenstive to Chip's handicap, and pretty much crazy.  I'd even accept this turn of events if Tom's responses were a little zanier than, for example, stealing Chip's yogurt or (very very) poorly concealing a camera beneath a tented magazine.These are really bad ideas, both for revenge and for a movie.  The makers of this dud should've done more than just tinker with the title; they should've retooled the whole thing, preferably with the help of the comedically proven cast.",2,"""The Ex"" Does Not Mark The Spot",1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,2849,"['never', 'good', 'sign', 'when', 'filmmakers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'call', 'films', 'one', 'was', 'originally', 'marketed', 'name', 'Fast', 'Track', 'defunct', 'title', 'also', 'up', 'end', 'credits', 'indicating', 'hijinks', 'be', 'found', 'corporate', 'zeitgeist', 'Then', 'name', 'was', 'changed', 'ostensibly', 'draw', 'focus', 'alpha', 'male', 'struggle', 'up', 'much', 'plot.Such', 'card-swapping', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'difference', 'movie', 'other', 'name', 'would', 'smell', 'just', 'stanky', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'donning', 'personality', 'as', 'interesting', 'acetate', 'Tom', 'Reilly', 'recently', 'fired', 'chef', 'who', 'job', 'father-in-law', 'advertising', 'agency', 'Also', 'employed', 'wife', 'sorta-kinda-ex-boyfriend', 'Chip', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'passive-aggressive', 'wheelchair-bound', 'jerk.So', 'let', 'see', 'advertising', 'milieu', 'lots', 'commercial', 'gags', 'have', 'upwardly-mobile', 'careerwoman', 'stuck', 'playing', 'homemaker', 'suburban', 'Ohio', 'Look', 'white', 'people', 'Tom', 'when', 'first', 'drive', 'town', 'Tom', 'working', 'father-in-law', 'wealth', 'material', 'even', 'dusty', 'look', 'cast', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'Fred', 'Armisen', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Romany', 'Malco', 'love', 'folks', 'paper', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'movie.Maybe', 'should', ""'ve"", 'written', 'more', 'stuff', 'paper', 'though', 'coherent', 'plot', 'funny', 'jokes', 'creative', 'character', 'struggles', 'example', 'Instead', 'have', 'pratfall', 'pratfall', 'lots', 'cripple', 'jokes', 'kid', 'who', 'can', 'swallow', 'entire', 'hamburger', 'chewing', 'once.Braff', 'Peet', 'play', 'straight', 'entire', 'cadre', 'wack-jobs', 'Sofia', 'New', 'Age', 'Baby', 'Classes', 'where', 'moms', 'ask', 'infants', 'permission', 'pick', 'up', 'Tom', 'co-workers', 'toss', 'pretend', 'teamwork', 'ball', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'say', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'writing', 'none', 'weirdos', 'given', 'much', 'room', 'stretch', 'talent', 'film', 'only', 'Grodin', 'father-in-law', 'Bob', 'closest', 'making', 'impression.It', 'not', 'fault', 'script', 'multiple', 'doctors', 'Chip', 'Tom', 'chance', 'can', 'get', 'instead', 'calmly', 'explaining', 'predicament', 'family', 'friends', 'Tom', 'classic', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'move', 'fighting', 'fire', 'fire', 'making', 'look', 'jealous', 'insenstive', 'Chip', 'handicap', 'pretty', 'much', 'crazy', ""'d"", 'even', 'accept', 'turn', 'events', 'Tom', 'responses', 'were', 'little', 'zanier', 'example', 'stealing', 'Chip', 'yogurt', 'very', 'very', 'poorly', 'concealing', 'camera', 'beneath', 'tented', 'magazine.These', 'are', 'really', 'bad', 'ideas', 'revenge', 'movie', 'makers', 'dud', 'should', ""'ve"", 'done', 'more', 'just', 'tinker', 'title', 'should', ""'ve"", 'retooled', 'whole', 'thing', 'preferably', 'help', 'comedically', 'proven', 'cast']",The Ex

The positive reviews sound as if the people seen a different movie than I did (which, I guess, in editing and such, could be true).Tom is an underachiever, working in jobs until he gets fed up and quits. When you see the way the boss treats the workers in his current job, you can completely understand and sympathize with him. Sofia, his wife, is not only a successful lawyer but pregnant. Sofia's plan is to be a stay at home mom while Tom supports the little family.Of course, this doesn't go well. They move back to Ohio, where his father-in-law gets him a job at the advertising agency where the father-in-law is employed. And what better than having your wife's exboyfriend, a ""handicapable"" man, be your mentor at the new job.You can probably imagine some funny scenarios, but the writers didn't seem to have that imagination. You know where you're going with this movie, which can be good, but this movie is not worth the journey. Nobody except Tom is likable. And Tom seems more pathetic than likable.There's a little side story of how Sofia gets into a ""mommy and me"" sort of group where they have some different views on baby raising. Sofia talks about breast feeding, but the costume designers didn't take into account the effect breast feeding has on a woman's body - a larger bust.But I stopped watching the movie about half way thru it and fast forwarded to the end.

It is neither ""Outrageously Funny,"" as Bill Bregoli from Westwood One put it, nor does it contain any ""off-the-wall go-for broke zaniness"" as another reviewer put it(See the DVD cover.).  Overall, it is a story that holds the viewer on edge, waiting for the insanity and laughs to ensue.  Unfortunately, as the end credits role, we may be happy to see the villain get his just desserts, but we find that we didn't laugh much on the way.

1056531,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000NDJGTK,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[5, 7]","Amusing bits of comedy daub the relatively unoriginal ""The Ex"", which marks director Jesse Peretz' first real Hollywood outing in years. Aspiring comedian Zach Braff portrays a just-shy-of-likeable character that is surrounded by slapstick circumstances and eccentric personas. While the film manages to entertain with a few outrageous gags and peculiar characters, the lack of an original storyline or any unique comedy forces an overwhelmingly mediocre result.Tom Reilly (Zach Braff) is happily married to Sofia (Amanda Peet) and they're about to have a baby. But the day Sofia gives birth, Zach is fired from his job as a chef. Having a trend of being unable to hold down a job, he convinces Sofia to move to Ohio where he can finally accept a job offer from her father Bob (Charles Grodin). Immediately upon being hired, he meets Chip Sanders (Jason Bateman) who knew Sofia during college. A rivalry starts, and the two struggle to outdo one another at work, frame each other for various screw-ups, and fight for the attention of Sofia and Bob.Has Hollywood completely lost its ability to devise an original story? It would seem so, as the impertinently titled ""The Ex"" is a confirmation to the unimaginative muck that is continually being churned out. With its banal plot, the events and circumstances that befall our hero also seem peculiarly commonplace. It appears that as each scene unfolds, we're reminded of a similar happening in a different film; as if ""The Ex"" is comprised of stolen tidbits from a dozen other better movies. While some of the jokes and antics are still humorous, even the slapstick feels recycled. The lack of an original story shares the film's downfall with its pathetically predictable characters and resolutions.Most of the cast are incredibly eccentric and individualistic, but this tends to annoy half of the time and allow for utter predictability the other half. Playing out like clockwork, each of the characters simply falls into place and they go through generic motions. Adding very little amusement to the grand scheme of things, we're left with the classically contemptible plot sorely sticking out.The acting all around is mediocre at best. Zach Braff seems uncomfortable in his role, and his lines are delivered with uncertainty. The script doesn't give anyone much room to shine, but Zach makes us think he'd rather be somewhere else. Whether the role was written with him in mind or not, he simply doesn't fit. It's a bad sign when the supporting actors are more entertaining than the leads. In this case, the supporting characters leave a longer lasting impression, but only because of their incorrigible annoyingness.The funniest bits of the film are completely irrelevant slapstick, or abrupt out-of-nowhere gags that don't tie into the story in any way. They are add-on segments that exist solely for laughs. And because of this extramural way of inciting audience interactivity, the PG-13 atmosphere hurts the film. The jokes are stunted and underdeveloped - and while they needn't be repulsive or raunchy, they suffer from their own concern for keeping the subject matter immoderately appropriate.The unoriginality of the film leads it to ruination. Fans of Zach Braff might be entertained, but only because of his presence. The acting falls short, not that we expected much, and the humor is ill-contrived at best. Overall, the film screams of mediocrity like several other recent filmmaking attempts that beg to be left alone in the corner of the video rental store.- Mike Massie",2,"""The Ex"" Movie Review",1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,3537,"['Amusing', 'bits', 'comedy', 'daub', 'relatively', 'unoriginal', 'Ex', 'director', 'Jesse', 'Peretz', 'first', 'real', 'Hollywood', 'outing', 'years', 'Aspiring', 'comedian', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'just-shy-of-likeable', 'character', 'surrounded', 'slapstick', 'circumstances', 'eccentric', 'personas', 'film', 'entertain', 'few', 'outrageous', 'gags', 'peculiar', 'characters', 'lack', 'original', 'storyline', 'unique', 'comedy', 'forces', 'overwhelmingly', 'mediocre', 'result.Tom', 'Reilly', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'happily', 'married', 'Sofia', 'Amanda', 'Peet', ""'re"", 'have', 'baby', 'day', 'Sofia', 'birth', 'Zach', 'fired', 'job', 'chef', 'Having', 'trend', 'being', 'unable', 'hold', 'down', 'job', 'Sofia', 'move', 'Ohio', 'where', 'can', 'finally', 'accept', 'job', 'offer', 'father', 'Bob', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'Immediately', 'being', 'hired', 'Chip', 'Sanders', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'who', 'knew', 'Sofia', 'college', 'rivalry', 'two', 'struggle', 'outdo', 'one', 'work', 'frame', 'other', 'various', 'screw-ups', 'fight', 'attention', 'Sofia', 'Bob.Has', 'Hollywood', 'completely', 'lost', 'ability', 'devise', 'original', 'story', 'would', 'seem', 'so', 'impertinently', 'titled', 'Ex', 'confirmation', 'unimaginative', 'muck', 'continually', 'being', 'churned', 'out', 'banal', 'plot', 'events', 'circumstances', 'befall', 'hero', 'also', 'seem', 'peculiarly', 'commonplace', 'scene', 'unfolds', ""'re"", 'reminded', 'similar', 'happening', 'different', 'film', 'Ex', 'comprised', 'stolen', 'tidbits', 'dozen', 'other', 'better', 'movies', 'jokes', 'antics', 'are', 'still', 'humorous', 'even', 'slapstick', 'feels', 'recycled', 'lack', 'original', 'story', 'shares', 'film', 'downfall', 'pathetically', 'predictable', 'characters', 'resolutions.Most', 'cast', 'are', 'incredibly', 'eccentric', 'individualistic', 'annoy', 'half', 'time', 'allow', 'utter', 'predictability', 'other', 'half', 'Playing', 'out', 'clockwork', 'characters', 'simply', 'place', 'go', 'generic', 'motions', 'Adding', 'very', 'little', 'amusement', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', ""'re"", 'left', 'classically', 'contemptible', 'plot', 'sorely', 'sticking', 'out.The', 'acting', 'around', 'mediocre', 'best', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'uncomfortable', 'role', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'uncertainty', 'script', ""n't"", 'give', 'anyone', 'much', 'room', 'shine', 'Zach', 'think', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'somewhere', 'else', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'mind', 'not', 'simply', ""n't"", 'fit', 'bad', 'sign', 'when', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'more', 'entertaining', 'leads', 'case', 'supporting', 'characters', 'leave', 'longer', 'lasting', 'impression', 'only', 'incorrigible', 'annoyingness.The', 'funniest', 'bits', 'film', 'are', 'completely', 'irrelevant', 'slapstick', 'abrupt', 'out-of-nowhere', 'gags', 'do', ""n't"", 'tie', 'story', 'way', 'are', 'add-on', 'segments', 'exist', 'solely', 'laughs', 'extramural', 'way', 'inciting', 'audience', 'interactivity', 'PG-13', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'jokes', 'are', 'stunted', 'underdeveloped', 'need', ""n't"", 'be', 'repulsive', 'raunchy', 'suffer', 'own', 'concern', 'keeping', 'subject', 'matter', 'immoderately', 'appropriate.The', 'unoriginality', 'film', 'ruination', 'Fans', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'might', 'be', 'entertained', 'only', 'presence', 'acting', 'falls', 'short', 'not', 'expected', 'much', 'humor', 'ill-contrived', 'best', 'Overall', 'film', 'screams', 'mediocrity', 'several', 'other', 'recent', 'filmmaking', 'attempts', 'beg', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'corner', 'video', 'rental', 'store.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",The Ex

I am glad I watched this on basic cable, because I saw the whole movie, not the weirdly edited version where no one knows if Chip can walk or not.  I can understand why people would give this movie low ratings because they haven't seen the real movie.  I see good ratings on movie sites until when the DVD came out, then there are bad reviews. So it might be the editing, right?I liked Zach Braff in this. Jason Bateman was great too. A couple SNL people and Paul Rudd make some nice, if not short, appearances.Not having seen the edited version, I can only go with what I read, so I beg you to not rent this on DVD and try to catch it on Comedy Central instead, where I do believe they show the whole movie intact.

1056533,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000NDJGTK,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[1, 1]","After the massive successes of Garden State and Scrubs, Zach Braff became a household name. Studio execs deemed him officially capable of headlining a movie, but apparently he just can't do it successfully. The Ex only took in a meager $3 million at the US Box office, and that's with costars like Amanda Peet (Saving Silverman, Something's Gotta Give) and Jason Bateman (Arrested Development). Not to mention a supporting cast that includes Charles Grodin, Mia Farrow, Donal Logue, Amy Poehler, Amy Adams, Fred Armisen, and an unmentioned Paul Rudd cameo. The film was released theatrically on May 11th, and now only three months later (August 21st), it's already making its DVD appearance. Even in our 21st century, fast-paced world, that's quick turnaround. With a track record like that, audience expectations can be set pretty low.What's interesting, though, is that The Ex doesn't live down to low expectations. It's got a solid cast, a solid story, and some pretty decent comedy gags. The three leads (Braff, Peet, and Bateman) are all known for superb comedic timing and deliver in every scene. Braff and Peet connect as a believable couple, the plot never feels stagnant or unoriginal, and the laugh out loud moments just seem to keep coming. Paul Rudd appears early on in a hilarious cameo as Braff's peevish boss, and the tone is set for the movie to take off. Charles Grodin, best known as the father in the Beethoven movies, makes a triumphant return to the screen after a decade-long hiatus. For the next hour or so, comedy fans will be wallowing in the heaven of unexpected laughs and outrageous gags as Bateman, Braff, and Peet expertly deliver the comic goods.  The film seems to be heading for an equally clever finale when suddenly everything is derailed: the comedy train breaks down and the story is lost... so what happened?Here's a quick plot breakdown: Braff is a chef. Peet is a lawyer. They're married. They live in New York. Peet is pregnant. Braff gets fired. They move back to Ohio where he works for her dad's ad agency. He discovers that his coworker (Bateman) is obsessed with his wife and trying to sabotage his job. He fights back. Hilarity ensues. Curtain.Not exactly the easiest story to market. The trailers make the film out to look like a slaphappy husband vs. ex-boyfriend in a wheelchair comedy mash. Unfunny clips that don't appear in the movie are thrown in, entire scenes are played out, and yet the audience still isn't sure what they're going to see. To be fair to promoters, The Ex doesn't exactly lend itself to easy marketing.  And it seems like the producers may have realized this 3/4ths of the way through production. After about 70 minutes, the story suddenly hits fast forward and everything happens at once, ending the movie at a mere 80 minutes, and leaving the audience feeling like they got treated to the quickest wrap up in film history. The three alternate endings, alternate opening, and slew of deleted scenes included on the disc speak volumes to the way this film must have been picked over and processed by the studio. The opening scenes are poorly filmed and almost feel like a different film and the same can be said for the finale. But the hour or so in between is built entirely in the world of hilarious light romantic comedy.In all the bloopers, and even on IMDB, the film is still listed as Fast Track. And it seems that this project got fast tracked off the studio lot and into theatres before director Jesse Peretz, former bassist for The Lemonheads, was ready to let it go. Then again, maybe he never had much interest in the film to begin with, or maybe writing team David Guion and Michael Handelman didn't give him enough to work with. As the Tootsie Roll Pop commercial states: ""The World May Never Know."" Whatever the case, The Ex is a clear example of a first-rate comedy getting pounded down into a quick mindless 80 minute studio writeoff. For audiences looking for 80 minutes of light-hearted, surprisingly delightful, comfortably off-color comedy, look no further. Just don't expect the beginning, middle, and end to connect.",3,"Solid comedy, but falls apart at the end",1187308800,"08 17, 2007",2007,4111,"['massive', 'successes', 'Garden', 'State', 'Scrubs', 'Zach', 'Braff', 'became', 'household', 'name', 'Studio', 'execs', 'deemed', 'officially', 'capable', 'headlining', 'movie', 'apparently', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'successfully', 'Ex', 'only', 'took', 'meager', '3', 'million', 'US', 'Box', 'office', 'costars', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Saving', 'Silverman', 'Something', 'Got', 'ta', 'Give', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'Not', 'mention', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Fred', 'Armisen', 'unmentioned', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'cameo', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', 'May', '11th', 'now', 'only', 'three', 'months', 'later', 'August', '21st', 'already', 'making', 'DVD', 'appearance', 'Even', '21st', 'century', 'fast-paced', 'world', 'quick', 'turnaround', 'track', 'record', 'audience', 'expectations', 'can', 'be', 'set', 'pretty', 'low.What', 'interesting', 'though', 'Ex', ""n't"", 'live', 'down', 'low', 'expectations', 'got', 'solid', 'cast', 'solid', 'story', 'pretty', 'decent', 'comedy', 'gags', 'three', 'leads', 'Braff', 'Peet', 'Bateman', 'are', 'known', 'superb', 'comedic', 'timing', 'deliver', 'scene', 'Braff', 'Peet', 'connect', 'believable', 'couple', 'plot', 'never', 'stagnant', 'unoriginal', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'just', 'seem', 'keep', 'coming', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'early', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'Braff', 'peevish', 'boss', 'tone', 'set', 'movie', 'take', 'off', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'best', 'known', 'father', 'Beethoven', 'movies', 'triumphant', 'return', 'screen', 'decade-long', 'hiatus', 'next', 'hour', 'so', 'comedy', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'wallowing', 'heaven', 'unexpected', 'laughs', 'outrageous', 'gags', 'Bateman', 'Braff', 'Peet', 'expertly', 'comic', 'goods', 'film', 'be', 'heading', 'equally', 'clever', 'finale', 'when', 'suddenly', 'everything', 'derailed', 'comedy', 'train', 'breaks', 'down', 'story', 'lost', 'so', 'what', 'happened', 'Here', 'quick', 'plot', 'breakdown', 'Braff', 'chef', 'Peet', 'lawyer', ""'re"", 'married', 'live', 'New', 'York', 'Peet', 'pregnant', 'Braff', 'fired', 'move', 'back', 'Ohio', 'where', 'dad', 'ad', 'agency', 'coworker', 'Bateman', 'obsessed', 'wife', 'trying', 'sabotage', 'job', 'back', 'Hilarity', 'Curtain.Not', 'exactly', 'easiest', 'story', 'market', 'trailers', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'slaphappy', 'husband', 'vs.', 'ex-boyfriend', 'wheelchair', 'comedy', 'mash', 'Unfunny', 'clips', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'movie', 'are', 'thrown', 'entire', 'scenes', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'yet', 'audience', 'still', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'be', 'fair', 'promoters', 'Ex', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'lend', 'easy', 'marketing', 'producers', 'may', 'have', 'realized', '3/4ths', 'way', 'production', '70', 'minutes', 'story', 'suddenly', 'fast', 'forward', 'everything', 'happens', 'once', 'ending', 'movie', 'mere', '80', 'minutes', 'leaving', 'audience', 'feeling', 'got', 'treated', 'quickest', 'wrap', 'up', 'film', 'history', 'three', 'alternate', 'endings', 'alternate', 'opening', 'slew', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'included', 'disc', 'speak', 'volumes', 'way', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'picked', 'processed', 'studio', 'opening', 'scenes', 'are', 'poorly', 'filmed', 'almost', 'feel', 'different', 'film', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'finale', 'hour', 'so', 'built', 'entirely', 'world', 'hilarious', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy.In', 'bloopers', 'even', 'IMDB', 'film', 'still', 'listed', 'Fast', 'Track', 'project', 'got', 'fast', 'tracked', 'off', 'studio', 'lot', 'theatres', 'director', 'Jesse', 'Peretz', 'former', 'bassist', 'Lemonheads', 'was', 'ready', 'let', 'go', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'interest', 'film', 'begin', 'maybe', 'writing', 'team', 'David', 'Guion', 'Michael', 'Handelman', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'enough', 'work', 'Tootsie', 'Roll', 'Pop', 'commercial', 'states', 'World', 'May', 'Never', 'Know', 'case', 'Ex', 'clear', 'example', 'first-rate', 'comedy', 'getting', 'pounded', 'down', 'quick', 'mindless', '80', 'minute', 'studio', 'writeoff', 'audiences', 'looking', '80', 'minutes', 'light-hearted', 'surprisingly', 'delightful', 'comfortably', 'off-color', 'comedy', 'look', 'further', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'connect']",The Ex
