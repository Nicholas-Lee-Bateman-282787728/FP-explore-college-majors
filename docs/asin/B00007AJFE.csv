I fell asleep...awoke 20 minutes later and still yapping without saying anything!!First, let me address the excessive use of the F word.  It's not funny!!  Once in a while, it can be used in a funny manner.  Literally, it's overused and very often used simply to fill the time.How many times have we heard the family stuff, where the white kids didn't get whippings like their black counterparts?  Overdone, we already know the joke before it spills out.The sex stuff....Heard it hundreds of time, nothing new, not funny.Martin Lawrence needs to get creative or get off the stage!  This was pathetically bad....  If you want to listen to something that will have you in tears, try theRichard Pryor - Live in ConcertANDRobin Williams - Live on Broadway.  These two can use the F word effectively.  That's what it takes, using it effectively and NOT excessively.  ...Rizzo",1,He can't shut the Blankety Blank Up!  Constant F-word is excessive.

726061,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00007AJFE,A Customer,"[8, 12]","Summary:It's about an hour and a half of Martin Lawrence doing stand up along with a short collage of video clips from his movies and some of the reports surrounding his arrests, etc.My Comments:Waste of an hour and a half.  No, it was worse than a waste, it was offensive and tasteless.  Thank goodness I was doing stuff on my laptop so I don't feel so bad about wasting my time.  Martin tells any critics watching the film that they can ....  Well, it probably has something to do the fact that he isn't funny.  There were a couple of times when I almost laughed.  But I just can't laugh at bigotry and ignorance.  Perhaps this is funny to some people.  Well, not me.The second major problem is that he actually tries to offer advice.  Why should I take any advice from Martin Lawrence?  Because he nearly killed himself and got thrown in jail?  Because he's done a lot of stupid stuff?  If you're going to give unrequested advice, you should at least make it good advice.  Don't look for it here.Perhaps what I find most fascinating, however, is that he can go from talking crassly about sex to praising god in the next sentence.  The variety of people that believe in god is stunning, from the ultra-pious to the disgustingly offensive.Overall, it isn't funny and it isn't worth your time.  I'm sure it must appeal to someone, but it definitely didn't appeal to me.

He then goes on to joke about certain issues like smoking, alcoholism, pregnancy and disciplining children.  He caps off the ""concert"" with his version of what happened during his run-ins with the law and his fateful coma.  The jokes weren't always tasteful, and the audience weren't only African-American.  I got a few good laughs out of it, but on the whole it was disappointing.  I even heard several audience members say ""That was stupid.""  I think Martin Lawrence is a funny guy as well as funny-looking.  But I choose to watch him in a movie rather than doing stand-up.This movie is not for kids and teens.  It contains a lot of mature topics and is very vulgar.

The problem is, I wish he could show more talent with quality material.  He's released a bunch of movies that seem to be commercially viable enough to keep his career going for awhile, but from what I've seen of them, once again I wish there was a lot more quality material, and not just the dependence on his star power.This is the same problem I have with this concert film.  There are enough good things to give it a viewing, but I wish it could have been a lot, lot more.  I will first address the ""Adult Language"" issue.  This movie looked like, on purpose, every effort was made to put as much swearing as possible in as a marketing move.  I'm not offended by this, and there are moments which do use it successfully.  It's that after awhile it becomes tiring, adds little to the humor, and brands him as well, a boor at times.  I need to tell Mr. Lawrence that my six-year old was coloring at the other end of the room while this was on.  He wasn't really listening to it, but picked up his head and asked why there were so many bad words in the movie.  I replied that he thinks they are funny.  My six-year-old, who doesn't swear, shrugged and went back to his coloring.  Since his grammar, by this example shows that it doesn't shock anybody anymore, I think he'd be a better comedian by trying to add some big words to his vocabulary.OK, so how was the performance otherwise?  We get some parallels with other comedians here.  He describes his misfortunes the way Richard Pryor used to do it.  But he doesn't do it as well as Richard Pryor did.  He also has his insights on life, and offers advice, like paying attention to your children.  But Chris Rock, who swears almost as much, is much funnier and more insightful than Lawrence.But to show I'm not a prude when it comes to sex or language, there were a few good moments in this area.  He does have a hysterical point in the show where he encourages people contemplating marriage to check out their prospective partners ""packages"".  He goes into delightfully obscene detail, especially when playing the part of the female, in doing a much more thorough inspection job than, well, the weapons inspectors in Iraq.That was the highlight of the film for me, and it's what the film needed a lot more of.  The movie is worth a look, but right now he's just minor-league material in my eyes when compared to other comedians.",2,He's a comedian.

Black Knight) will have comedy historians guessing for centuries.

Other than that, Martin was whining and complaining about the bad press he's been getting.
