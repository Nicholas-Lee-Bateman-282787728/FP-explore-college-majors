Even though he's in his eighties, he does most of the work himself.  A building inspector gives him grief over every little thing, but he struggles though and shows that no matter what your age, determination and having something worth fighting for are all you need to get things accomplished.Still Mine proves that love can really last a life time. Oscar nominees James Cronwell and Genevieve Bujold both give striking performance. The sweet romance they share just emanates from the screen and gives me hope that soul mates are more than just a myth.

While it broke my heart, it also was quite healing; and I could only hope that someone (anyone) might love me so much as that affection and deep-soul type love that was so manifest in this movie.
