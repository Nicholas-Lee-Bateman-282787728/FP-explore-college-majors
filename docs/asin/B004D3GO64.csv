In addition to the skits seen on UTube, there are also other scenes, some serious.  However, this adds more of a storyline to the show.  I enjoy these discs as much as I've enjoyed watching the short skits on UTube.  Recently, I've heard new episodes are being aired in Ireland.  Hopefully, they will become available in the U.S. once they are out on DVD.",5,Funniest show yet,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,476,"['received', 'set', 'Holiday', 'gift', 'daughter', 'had', 'problem', 'playing', 'discs', 'DVD', 'players', 'addition', 'skits', 'seen', 'UTube', 'are', 'also', 'other', 'scenes', 'serious', 'However', 'more', 'storyline', 'show', 'enjoy', 'discs', 'as', 'much', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'short', 'skits', 'UTube', 'Recently', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'new', 'episodes', 'are', 'being', 'aired', 'Ireland', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'become', 'available', 'U.S.', 'are', 'out', 'DVD']",Mrs Brown's Boys - The Original Series
1396585,A1DTNYGTWIN4DS,B004D3GO64,NateMonroe,"[0, 0]","This series was made before the actual BBC show.It is worth a look, but it is not as funny as the BBC show or the live shows. This is where Mrs. Brown was developing into the hilarious show it is today.It is interesting to see how the cast has changed to what it is today. There was a different woman playing the part of Winnie here. She was cool and collected. The sister of Brendon plays Winnie now and makes the part hilarious.Brendon's real life son plays Buster now, but here, he played another one of the Brown children for a couple episodes. Then the character disappears and is barely spoken of.The part of Sharon was recast as well.I recommend it, but it doesn't have the bite yet that the BBC show has.",4,This is the pre-BBC show---see how the show got it's footing,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,712,"['series', 'was', 'made', 'actual', 'BBC', 'show.It', 'look', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'BBC', 'show', 'live', 'shows', 'where', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'was', 'developing', 'hilarious', 'show', 'today.It', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'cast', 'changed', 'what', 'today', 'was', 'different', 'woman', 'playing', 'part', 'Winnie', 'here', 'was', 'cool', 'collected', 'sister', 'Brendon', 'Winnie', 'now', 'part', 'hilarious.Brendon', 'real', 'life', 'son', 'Buster', 'now', 'here', 'played', 'one', 'Brown', 'children', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Then', 'character', 'disappears', 'barely', 'spoken', 'of.The', 'part', 'Sharon', 'was', 'recast', 'well.I', 'recommend', ""n't"", 'have', 'bite', 'yet', 'BBC', 'show']",Mrs Brown's Boys - The Original Series
