1586140,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B0095I9B1M,I. Giles,"[0, 0]","This disc, recorded in 2011 at Glyndebourne has almost left me speechless. Fortunately this doesn't affect the written word quite so much so I shall try to encapsulate my reactions and the reasons behind them.This is the third version of this production put on at Glyndebourne and, as Jonathan Kent the producer explains in the very informative bonus films, each time there has been a pr&eacute;cising down with an ever increasing concentration of impact. The period is the 1950's, the period in which the story was written. There has been a deliberate attempt to avoid `hiding' behind a Victorian ghost story and rather there is portrayed a psychological drama set in the last decade of believable innocence.The staging is very simple in so far as there is a revolving stage with a central large glass panel like an enormous window that is tilted and turned in all directions. This glass panel acts as a see-through screen mediating between the real and imagined, the inside and outside and many other pairs of opposites as the story progresses.The cast in the opera are just six accompanied by a very small chamber orchestra which only rarely plays together. The instruments are imaginatively used in small combinations to create remarkable and effective textures ideal to create the shifting moods of the story.The opera starts with a prologue taken by Toby Spence who also takes the part of Peter Quince. In this he acts in an un-ghostly manner and in this way achieves a character of utter evil. The two children are played by Joanna Songi as Flora and Thomas Parfitt as Miles. Both are note perfect and this has to be seen as a remarkable achievement from a 12 year old boy. Mrs Grose is an effective housekeeper, played by Susan Bickley and Mrs Jessel is strongly played by Giselle Allen. The stage star of the evening has to be Miah Persson as the governess whose innocence is equally destroyed by events.I have used the words `played' or `taken' to describe the cast as this is in line with Jonathan Kent's description of his role as similar to producing a play or drama on stage. However this is also an opera and, without singling out anyone at all as that would be invidious in the circumstances, I would like to stress that the considerable musical demands of the score are overcome to the point where one never even considers them, the viewer is so caught up in the drama.There are many simply spine tingling moments and here the camera work certainly aids the impact of the video production. The imaging is very sharp and the colour rendition is perfect. The sound is presented in both DTS 5.1 and stereo and is as full ranging as the instrumentation allows and is especially clear. The conductor, Jakub Hrusa, is able to conjure superb results from his small band of talented musicians.The 22 minutes of bonus films offer a deep insight to this work and production in the words of the producer, designer, conductor and cast. Excellently informative.This has been one of the most powerful operatic statements I have ever seen and I normally struggle with much of Britten's operatic vocal writing. I would expect it to have much the same effect on most purchasers so a 5 star assessment is inevitable.To sum up my own personal response: astounding; extraordinary; inspirational etc. etc......In conclusion therefore, I would suggest that this disc should warrant, at the very least, very serious consideration from any purchaser looking for a fine modern recording of this powerful opera.........................................Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:Thank you for your review. I love this opera, and have been wanting to order this blu-ray, but shaken by so many bizarre stagings of late I have been waiting for someone to describe exactly how this is handled. So, from now on, when I mean ""helpful"" I will post a comment. Thanks again (UK review)Thank you for the review, which is indeed helpful.

1586142,A3K8O01S0XGWHT,B0095I9B1M,"Larry Bridges ""thebachelor""","[7, 7]","This excellent but not necessarily definitive production from Glyndebourne worthily represents Britten's ""The Turn of the Screw"" in the Blu-Ray format. The decision to set the production in the 1950s, when the opera was composed, rather than in the Victorian era, has definite benefits but disadvantages as well. The story becomes more emotionally immediate, and perhaps it's true, as the booklet suggests, that the caste system was still present enough in 1950s Britain to make believable such elements as Mrs. Grose asking if she may ""take the liberty"" to kiss the Governess. On the other hand, the Governess' strength of character (for good or for ill) is less remarkable than in the original, in which one has to bear in mind that she cannot vote and has been raised with the unquestioning acceptance that hers is the inferior gender, socially, morally and intellectually (cf. Flora's resentment when the Governess tells her they need to work on ""Miles' Latin"").The visual production is full of excellent touches, especially the coup de theatre at the end of the Prologue when the home movie of Miles and Flora is replaced by a projection of the windows of the Governess' train. I also liked how the revolving stage allows Flora's dollhouse to take on the role of the house of Bly itself on the other side of the lake from which Miss Jessel appears. However, I found the depiction of the ghosts somewhat over the top. Toby Spence cuts a chilling figure in his modern suit as Peter Quint, but does he have to play him quite so much like a ""Doctor Who"" villain? It's especially disappointing after Spence's human and likable Prologue. And must Miss Jessel look like Kristen Wiig playing a Korean water ghost on SNL?Incidentally, the Prologue is staged with Toby Spence examining a chest of artifacts from the events at Bly, including home movies, the boat Flora makes beside the lake and Miles' teddy bear. This raises the interesting question of who precisely the Prologue **is**. (He is, of course, inspired by the character of Douglas in James' story, but the details of the framing device involving Douglas are omitted from the opera.) If he simply has the Governess' manuscript in his possession, he could be almost anyone -- a great-nephew of the Governess? Henry James? Peter Pears? -- and need not have any strong emotional connection to the events at Bly. In this production, however, his having the chest implies that he is someone connected to Miles and Flora's family as well as to the Governess. Could he be a grown-up Miles, whose death was merely a delusion on the Governess' part (although his hair color is different)?Perhaps the most memorable and chilling moment in this production is the scene of the children going to church. From both the words of the libretto and Miles and Flora's actions -- especially what they do with Flora's doll -- it is clear that the children are uttering terrible blasphemies against Christianity. What makes the scene especially disturbing in this production is the realization that an audience in modern secular Britain presumably sees nothing wrong with children saying and doing these things. The ceremony of innocence is drowned, indeed.",4,"""I found it. I like it.
