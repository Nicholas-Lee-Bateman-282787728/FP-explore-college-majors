1510561,ALLHLOG4NLA0A,B00652U6XI,"Ray St John ""Ray St John""","[8, 28]","If the 60s had JFK, in the 1990s we had BILL CLINTON. I just got this today and even though PBS tries to do this impartial documentary, to me it was BIASED.They didn't focused at all on his accomplishments as a president. Yet the focus mostly on the WHITE WATER and the LEWINSKY scandal.THE BOTTOM LINE - He left this country in a SURPLUS which is something we CANT say about any of the BUSH'S administrations. Specially George Bush Jr, who left this country after 8 years in Shrapnel. Thanks to BUSH we are in the shape we are in 2012 with very high unemployment and I hate to admit it but Obama hasn't done much.I don't know why TED SORENSEN(JFK's personal aide) before he passed way was always comparing OBAMA to JFK(I think he got paid off), where in fact Clinton was more like JFK. The only thing is that we didn't have to deal with a nuclear crisis like JFK in October of 1962.JFK & CLINTON - Both suffered defeats, The Bay Of Pigs and Rwanda....and specially were womanizers. SO WHAT WHO CARES????? JFK I guess because of fortune of the 1960s, wasn't bothered with his private life which is the way it should be in a presidents life. Like Clinton will say once, even though he lied, ""It is time to stop prying into personal lives and get on with our national life"".If Clinton banged Lewinsky like a Salvation Army drum. So what!! How many Republicans Senators, Congressmen and other politicians don't do the same and all the right wingers try to act as they were saints. HELL NO!But all good presidents that stand by the people of this country and are against giving the RICH tax breaks always have to pay a high price.This DVD is informative and GOD knows I wanted a copy, but I think a lot of it is emphasized in scandals and his personal life. Who cares!JFK who was an amazing president did Marylin Monroe, his girl staff and anyone that came into the picture. Is not what he does in his personal life, is that he does for our NATIONAL LIFE like CLINTON DID and is what that counts.I have to give this DVD a 1 star rating because it defeats the purpose of what it should've been. Yet the history channel did this documentary on Reagan like he was a hero. If this documentary was this hard and abrasive, I don't want to imagine what they did for George Bush who destroyed this country in 8 years. But for all we know PBS may be republican like FOX NEWS and made him look like a saint.I hope someone comes forward one day and does a Clinton documentary the way it is meant to be a President stood by us and left us in great shape. As I write this in March, 30th of 2012, I don't know if Ill see a day in my lifetime like the Clinton years because thanks to George Bush we are so badly in debt, I do hope we dont hit a recession like we did in the 1920s where people are outside in breadlines asking for food. If you dont believe me youtube it. It is scary that a country this powerful went through it. But FDR got us out of it.BILL C - If you read this, please don't be mad about PBS because believe me I am. I do love your books and Hillary's. To me Clinton will be remembered as the only president who did make a difference for us and was in fact set up with the Lewinsky scandal to damage his character. But in the end, who can resist women. They are the most beautiful beings on earth.THANK YOU BILL CLINTON FOR ALL YOU DID FOR OUR COUNTRY AND FORGIVE THEM FOR THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DID OR WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH YOUR LEGACY!!GOD BLESS YOURAY ST JOHNP.S. Besides the fact that I hate this, I do recommend BILL CLINTON - BIOGRAPHY on DVD. That one is very good but it falls short. Is only about 50 mins. That one does cover all the GOOD he did an goes barely through all the issues.

1510563,A11548ZOIDAELN,B00652U6XI,S P,"[2, 4]","Clinton, one in a long line of American Experience presidential portraits, brings to the table a well-rounded and informative portrait of the president. You will walk away with an understanding of the course of his political life, and the major issues that shaped his two terms in office.This man is perhaps least understood by people like me, who were very young when he took office and never experienced him ""live."" Before I watched this, I generally understood his tenure as one of a sex scandal and impeachment. Most of his other accomplishments and failures faded to the background. Thankfully, this video provides a vicarious catch-up on what happened a few years ago. Lest we turn Bill into a one-liner, it is important to watch this film, remembering what he accomplished as a politician and reflecting on his vision as a leader. Depth and fairness are really the goals of public broadcasting, and this program provides a great deal of both. The content is thoughtful and memorable.That being said, the stylistic approach caused me to shake my head a few times in disappointment. Compare this withAmerican Experience: FDR, which presented overwhelmingly-neutral and unembellished commentary. This film, though, at times strays into subjectivity, dramatization, and triviality. Some of the commentary takes on a tabloid style.The problem is most noticeable with the coverage of the president's scandals. While you would hope the topic to be covered carefully and given due context, PBS seemed to adopt the popular approach - to make it an issue of book deals, high-powered wheeling and dealing, and attention-grabbing headlines. They had to have spent ten minutes of face time on the book publisher who wanted to expose the president for her own financial gain. Those kinds of people have no role in an objective documentary. It is something you would expect more from cable news, which will go to any length to make a story more than it is. You can also see the journalistic excesses in the bombastic language used by the narrator; he seems to seek drama out of every event.This style reflects the 24-hour news cycle that began around the time Clinton took office and has degraded journalistic standards ever since. It seems the influence has spread even to PBS. If there is any degree of bias in the film, it comes from the mouths of these interviewees. Each talking head seems to have an agenda, be it defending the president or celebrating his decline.Even with these objections in mind, I cannot but strongly endorse the program. It presents a remarkable biography that can add to the understanding of anyone who watches it. And it does so with a richness that makes the experience worthwhile. It is most of what you would expect from a quality documentary.",4,Bombastic Yet Triumphant,1334361600,"04 14, 2012",2012,2769,"['Clinton', 'one', 'long', 'line', 'American', 'Experience', 'presidential', 'portraits', 'table', 'well-rounded', 'informative', 'portrait', 'president', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'understanding', 'course', 'political', 'life', 'major', 'issues', 'shaped', 'two', 'terms', 'office.This', 'man', 'perhaps', 'least', 'understood', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'very', 'young', 'when', 'took', 'office', 'never', 'experienced', 'live', 'watched', 'generally', 'understood', 'tenure', 'one', 'sex', 'scandal', 'impeachment', 'Most', 'other', 'accomplishments', 'failures', 'faded', 'background', 'Thankfully', 'video', 'vicarious', 'catch-up', 'what', 'happened', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Lest', 'turn', 'Bill', 'one-liner', 'important', 'watch', 'film', 'remembering', 'what', 'accomplished', 'politician', 'reflecting', 'vision', 'leader', 'Depth', 'fairness', 'are', 'really', 'goals', 'public', 'broadcasting', 'program', 'great', 'deal', 'content', 'thoughtful', 'memorable.That', 'being', 'said', 'stylistic', 'approach', 'caused', 'shake', 'head', 'few', 'times', 'disappointment', 'Compare', 'withAmerican', 'Experience', 'FDR', 'presented', 'overwhelmingly-neutral', 'unembellished', 'commentary', 'film', 'though', 'times', 'strays', 'subjectivity', 'dramatization', 'triviality', 'commentary', 'tabloid', 'style.The', 'problem', 'most', 'noticeable', 'coverage', 'president', 'scandals', 'would', 'hope', 'topic', 'be', 'covered', 'carefully', 'given', 'due', 'context', 'PBS', 'seemed', 'adopt', 'popular', 'approach', 'make', 'issue', 'book', 'deals', 'high-powered', 'wheeling', 'dealing', 'attention-grabbing', 'headlines', 'had', 'have', 'spent', 'ten', 'minutes', 'face', 'time', 'book', 'publisher', 'who', 'wanted', 'expose', 'president', 'own', 'financial', 'gain', 'kinds', 'people', 'have', 'role', 'objective', 'documentary', 'something', 'would', 'expect', 'more', 'cable', 'news', 'will', 'go', 'length', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'journalistic', 'excesses', 'bombastic', 'language', 'used', 'narrator', 'seek', 'drama', 'event.This', 'style', '24-hour', 'news', 'cycle', 'began', 'time', 'Clinton', 'took', 'office', 'degraded', 'journalistic', 'standards', 'ever', 'influence', 'spread', 'even', 'PBS', 'degree', 'bias', 'film', 'mouths', 'interviewees', 'talking', 'head', 'have', 'agenda', 'be', 'defending', 'president', 'celebrating', 'decline.Even', 'objections', 'mind', 'can', 'not', 'strongly', 'endorse', 'program', 'remarkable', 'biography', 'can', 'add', 'understanding', 'anyone', 'who', 'so', 'richness', 'experience', 'worthwhile', 'most', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'quality', 'documentary']",American Experience: Clinton
