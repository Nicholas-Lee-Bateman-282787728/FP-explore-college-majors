682574,A22WSUGN8IVD5O,B00005TZYB,Carolyn J.,"[1, 1]","I have taken YEARS of ballet, so I feel pretty comfortable picking up new routines, but they way they filmed this made it almost impossible.I found this at a trhift store and could hardly wait to get working on it. These are the frustrating problems that I had with it.#1 He faces the camera, saying ""right"" and ""left"", and now I have to translate the whole thing in my head. He should have his back to the camera while working in a mirror, like a REAL instructor. I am sure when he taught his professional crew, he was not facing them.#2. The camera won't hold still. Every few seconds, it's a differnt angle: now up close, now pull back, now slow sweep, now a tilt.  The tilt was very disconcerting when they all leaned back and started sliding.#3. PLEASE! Show us the feet! But no, we get a zoom on his upper torso while he is saying things like, ""now kick-ball-change, and step . . . ""#4. I have no idea why he bothered having people in the back. Maybe so it looks like a class, but since it is supposed to be a class for me, I wish the camera was back there.#5. When they review, the camera cuts around even more, so when they do something intereting, like jump or turn, the camera cuts, and, DUH!, you can't see what they just did.Have you ever watched a Fred Astaire dance segment? They shoot the whole thing in one, steady clip, showing his whole head-to-toe body.  His dances are interesing enough that he does not need camera cuts and angles to enhance it. After watching this ONCE, I decided to toss it.  I am glad I only paid the thrift-store price for it.",1,Camera angles sabotage anything good about this video.,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,1568,"['have', 'taken', 'YEARS', 'ballet', 'feel', 'pretty', 'comfortable', 'picking', 'up', 'new', 'routines', 'way', 'filmed', 'made', 'almost', 'impossible.I', 'found', 'trhift', 'store', 'could', 'hardly', 'wait', 'get', 'working', 'are', 'frustrating', 'problems', 'had', 'it.', '1', 'camera', 'saying', 'right', 'left', 'now', 'have', 'translate', 'whole', 'thing', 'head', 'should', 'have', 'back', 'camera', 'working', 'mirror', 'REAL', 'instructor', 'am', 'sure', 'when', 'taught', 'professional', 'crew', 'was', 'not', 'facing', 'them.', '2', 'camera', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hold', 'still', 'Every', 'few', 'seconds', 'differnt', 'angle', 'now', 'close', 'now', 'back', 'now', 'slow', 'sweep', 'now', 'tilt', 'tilt', 'was', 'very', 'disconcerting', 'when', 'leaned', 'back', 'started', 'sliding.', '3', 'PLEASE', 'Show', 'feet', 'get', 'zoom', 'upper', 'torso', 'saying', 'things', 'now', 'kick-ball-change', 'step', '4', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'bothered', 'having', 'people', 'back', 'Maybe', 'class', 'supposed', 'be', 'class', 'wish', 'camera', 'was', 'back', 'there.', '5', 'When', 'review', 'camera', 'around', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'do', 'something', 'intereting', 'jump', 'turn', 'camera', 'cuts', 'DUH', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'just', 'did.Have', 'ever', 'watched', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'dance', 'segment', 'shoot', 'whole', 'thing', 'one', 'steady', 'clip', 'showing', 'whole', 'head-to-toe', 'body', 'dances', 'are', 'interesing', 'enough', 'not', 'need', 'camera', 'cuts', 'angles', 'enhance', 'watching', 'ONCE', 'decided', 'toss', 'am', 'glad', 'only', 'paid', 'thrift-store', 'price']",N/A

Now I can pretend to be cool like all of those pop stars!  The best part about this video is that I can learn at my own pace.  Darrin was nice enough to break it down for me into fast, easy-to-learn steps.I think it's great that Darrin took time out of his busy schedule to make this video.  His choreography is TIGHT!  After learning all of these phat moves, I actually feel like I'm a member of *NSYNC, or a back-up dancer for Britney Spears, or an extra on the set of ""Breakin' 3: Electric Boogaloo 2"".Don't expect to learn these rad dance moves over night, you'll really need to work at it.  I practiced for two hours every day after school, and it still took me a month to learn Darrin's exciting ""pop n' lock"" routine.

682576,A3UISFQMOSZJMO,B00005TZYB,Elizebeth Neumann,"[9, 9]","I bought this tape so I could add more variety to my excersize routine. I have the Latin Fat Blaster from the Crunch series and enjoy doing dance for cardio and thought this would be more of the same. I was very wrong, I wish I had read the reviews here before I bought it.I expected there to be about 50 minutes of dancing and about 5 minutes of information about Darrin but it seems like it's the other way around. You get to hear Darrin talk about himself in between each routine which equals more time on him than doing any dancing. It is obvious that he loves himself because the camera is always on him and almost always on his upper body and face which is frustrating when your trying to guesse what the heck to do with your feet. He does go through the moves very slowly but you only go through the routine twice before you are ready to go at full speed. I think it would have been very helpful for him and the dancers to go through the routine once before having you do it along with him.Of course you can always re-wind the tape and do it over but since I dont like the instructor or the instructions its very hard to want to do it more than once.Im not a clutz and catch on very quickly, I was just dissapointed in the quality of this tape and had hoped for more.

Okay, the only place I've seen this video advertised is on Nickelodeon, which, for anyone who doesn't know is a kids station. It is marketted in such a way that one would think you wouldn't already have to know how to dance to get started with this video. It says easy, slow and step by step. I did not find it to be true. The video is loaded with junk that has nothing to do with the dance steps, it is mostly clips of music videos, a biography on Darrin (who cares!) and other people blabbing, unnecessary, long, drawn out, boring, seems like they do it just to waste time. Rip off! Then you get to the dance moves. It is NOT slow enough for a beginner! It moves very fast and I found it very hard to follow. I bought this video for two 11 year olds, and while their not ready to give up, we all were under the impression that we would be able to follow some simple steps to get the idea, it just isn't so.

682580,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B00005TZYB,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[4, 4]","I got this DVD a few years ago. There is no music playing while he teaches, he only show 5 moves at a time, no breakdown other then to day 1 and 2 and 3 and..., he would never call out the move before you did it, so the first time you'd have NO clue what was next, he would do it 1/2 time 2x, then on the next 5 moves & would go through all 30+ moves before doing the whole thing 1 time at 1/2 speed then with music full speed with video playing.Only a few moves throughout the whole routine would he give a second instruction on minute hand gestures. He never broke down the footwork, the camera would be zoomed at their faces, hardly ever at the feet.The moves are decent, the backup 3 guys & about 5 girls seemed nice, Darrin seems nice, the extra pop/locking tiny routine with him & 2 guys is cool but your Rew button will get rubbed down.

682581,A3EVGPGOFVAP09,B00005TZYB,"WorknMan ""worknman""","[34, 35]","Unless you have a DVD player with the 'A/B repeate' feature and slow motion/frame-by-frame playback capabilities, I wouldn't even consider this video. But even if you have such equipment, I think I would still give this video a pass. I have a DVD player with the capabilities I just mentioned but even with that, the video is still frustrating and difficult to learn from, for reasons I am about to go into. I gave the video 2 stars, but it should really be 1 and a half.The worst complaint I have about this video is the shoddy camera work. They tried to give it a flashy, 'MTV'-style presentation, but it really doesn't work here. Darrin could be showing you a move that requires you to do something with your feet, but the camera is pointed at his upper body and you can't even see his feet!!! I mean, how do they expect you to learn this way? Sometimes when the camera isn't where it is supposed to be, you can sometimes see what the background dancer's feet are doing, which is even worse because they're not always doing the same thing as Darrin!!! To its credit, Darrin will usually go over the moves more than once and the spots that had ... camera angles are usually fixed the second time around, but on the second go-around, there are all new...camera angles. This means that you are constantly going back and forth, because neither time does the camera stay steady enough so that you can watch it all the way through.Second complaint is what so many others have mentioned - since Darrin is facing you, you have to do the exact opposite of whatever he does. I originally didn't think this would be a big deal when reading the negative comments, but it really is confusing and un-nerving. A much better approach would have been to implement multiple camera angles, so you could watch from whatever angle you needed to.Third complaint - when Darrin is showing you the moves, he does it slower than what you normally would do it in real time. At the end, he shows you how to do the dance moves to the actual speed of the music. Only problem with that is that instead of keeping the camera focused the whole time on Darrin and his background dancers, the camera cuts between Darrin and his dancers, to the artists of the music (Britney, N'Stink, etc), to both Darrin and the artists split screen (with one on top and one on bottom). Besides this being confusing as heck, sometimes when the camera cuts in on the artists, they're not even doing the dance moves in question, so you completely miss parts of it!!!Fourth complaint - the only thing this video shows you is how to dance to the chorus of certain songs (Bye Bye Bye, Crazy, Digital Getdown, etc). So, if you're looking for some basic dance steps, this is definitely not for you.Overall, the whole presentation of this dance video is sloppy and unacceptable and should be avoided. I must point out that it IS possible to learn what this video has to teach, but it's not fun!! My advice to anyone who is considering making an instructional dance video is to KEEP THE DAMN CAMERA STILL!!!The only thing I have to compare this to on DVD is Hip Hop Shop, which much better than this, but also suffers from some of the same problems (mainly the wandering camera) as this one does.",2,Be careful!,1015113600,"03 3, 2002",2002,3239,"['have', 'DVD', 'player', 'A/B', 'repeate', 'feature', 'slow', 'motion/frame-by-frame', 'playback', 'capabilities', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'video', 'even', 'have', 'such', 'equipment', 'think', 'would', 'still', 'give', 'video', 'pass', 'have', 'DVD', 'player', 'capabilities', 'just', 'mentioned', 'even', 'video', 'still', 'frustrating', 'difficult', 'learn', 'reasons', 'am', 'go', 'gave', 'video', '2', 'stars', 'should', 'really', 'be', '1', 'half.The', 'worst', 'complaint', 'have', 'video', 'shoddy', 'camera', 'work', 'tried', 'give', 'flashy', ""'MTV'-style"", 'presentation', 'really', ""n't"", 'work', 'here', 'Darrin', 'could', 'be', 'showing', 'move', 'do', 'something', 'feet', 'camera', 'pointed', 'upper', 'body', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'feet', 'mean', 'how', 'do', 'expect', 'learn', 'way', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'camera', ""n't"", 'where', 'supposed', 'be', 'can', 'sometimes', 'see', 'what', 'background', 'dancer', 'feet', 'are', 'doing', 'even', 'worse', ""'re"", 'not', 'always', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'Darrin', 'credit', 'Darrin', 'will', 'usually', 'go', 'moves', 'more', 'once', 'spots', 'had', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'usually', 'fixed', 'second', 'time', 'second', 'go-around', 'are', 'new', 'camera', 'are', 'constantly', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'camera', 'stay', 'steady', 'enough', 'can', 'watch', 'way', 'through.Second', 'complaint', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Darrin', 'facing', 'have', 'do', 'exact', 'opposite', 'originally', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'when', 'reading', 'negative', 'comments', 'really', 'confusing', 'un-nerving', 'much', 'better', 'approach', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'implement', 'multiple', 'camera', 'angles', 'could', 'watch', 'angle', 'needed', 'to.Third', 'complaint', 'when', 'Darrin', 'showing', 'moves', 'slower', 'what', 'normally', 'would', 'do', 'real', 'time', 'end', 'how', 'do', 'dance', 'actual', 'speed', 'music', 'Only', 'problem', 'instead', 'keeping', 'camera', 'focused', 'whole', 'time', 'Darrin', 'background', 'dancers', 'camera', 'Darrin', 'dancers', 'artists', 'music', 'Britney', ""N'Stink"", 'etc', 'Darrin', 'artists', 'split', 'screen', 'one', 'top', 'one', 'bottom', 'being', 'confusing', 'heck', 'sometimes', 'when', 'camera', 'artists', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'doing', 'dance', 'moves', 'question', 'completely', 'miss', 'parts', 'Fourth', 'complaint', 'only', 'thing', 'video', 'how', 'dance', 'chorus', 'certain', 'songs', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Bye', 'Crazy', 'Digital', 'Getdown', 'etc', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'basic', 'dance', 'steps', 'definitely', 'not', 'you.Overall', 'whole', 'presentation', 'dance', 'video', 'sloppy', 'unacceptable', 'should', 'be', 'avoided', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'possible', 'learn', 'what', 'video', 'teach', 'not', 'fun', 'advice', 'anyone', 'who', 'considering', 'making', 'instructional', 'dance', 'video', 'KEEP', 'THE', 'DAMN', 'CAMERA', 'STILL', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'compare', 'DVD', 'Hip', 'Hop', 'Shop', 'much', 'better', 'also', 'suffers', 'same', 'problems', 'mainly', 'wandering', 'camera', 'one']",N/A
