1410494,AEGYKCHYY809X,B004I9SJF2,John Chandler,"[18, 20]","In the days of LD and VHS NG produced a wide range of interesting reports that concentrated on the animals. Recently there has been a trend towards talking more and more about the background and the people involved, so much so that the animals are almost coming second. This release is entitled Big Cats but in reality is as much about the Jouberts, the Masai and government politics. That is all very well but in no way does this compare with the vividly close to nature presentations from the BBC. A large part of the video is from SD recordings many years ago and the overall video quality is far below say Planet Earth and overall not much better than a DVD. The editing was a bit hit and miss and the subtitles and program advertising from the Lion Warriors segment was particularly muddled and poorly finished.Overall I was unimpressed and for the price I found it poor value and NOT something I would pop in the player to get closer to say the Lions who were by far the main actors in this series. Tigers who feature on the box hardly appear in the videos. Having said all that the second presentation on the Leopard Queen was by far the best and the only one I am likely to repeat. Rent perhaps but I regard this as not worth a purchase and following on from a sloppy Great Migrations and a rather ordinary Relentless Enemies from the same source I feel the NG nature videos are now no longer competitive. The BBC is just so far ahead and increasing their lead with every release. Pity really as my old NG LDs still give me pleasure but of course the picture quality is now very dated.",3,I was disappointed,1320278400,"11 3, 2011",2011,1593,"['days', 'LD', 'VHS', 'NG', 'produced', 'wide', 'range', 'interesting', 'reports', 'concentrated', 'animals', 'Recently', 'been', 'trend', 'talking', 'more', 'more', 'background', 'people', 'involved', 'so', 'much', 'animals', 'are', 'almost', 'coming', 'second', 'release', 'entitled', 'Big', 'Cats', 'reality', 'as', 'much', 'Jouberts', 'Masai', 'government', 'politics', 'very', 'well', 'way', 'compare', 'vividly', 'close', 'nature', 'presentations', 'BBC', 'A', 'large', 'part', 'video', 'SD', 'recordings', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'overall', 'video', 'quality', 'far', 'say', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'overall', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'editing', 'was', 'bit', 'hit', 'miss', 'subtitles', 'program', 'advertising', 'Lion', 'Warriors', 'segment', 'was', 'particularly', 'muddled', 'poorly', 'finished.Overall', 'was', 'unimpressed', 'price', 'found', 'poor', 'value', 'NOT', 'something', 'would', 'pop', 'player', 'get', 'closer', 'say', 'Lions', 'who', 'were', 'far', 'main', 'actors', 'series', 'Tigers', 'who', 'feature', 'box', 'hardly', 'appear', 'videos', 'Having', 'said', 'second', 'presentation', 'Leopard', 'Queen', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'only', 'one', 'am', 'likely', 'repeat', 'Rent', 'perhaps', 'regard', 'not', 'purchase', 'following', 'sloppy', 'Great', 'Migrations', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'Relentless', 'Enemies', 'same', 'source', 'feel', 'NG', 'nature', 'videos', 'are', 'now', 'no', 'longer', 'competitive', 'BBC', 'just', 'so', 'far', 'ahead', 'increasing', 'lead', 'release', 'Pity', 'really', 'old', 'NG', 'LDs', 'still', 'give', 'pleasure', 'course', 'picture', 'quality', 'now', 'very', 'dated']",N/A
