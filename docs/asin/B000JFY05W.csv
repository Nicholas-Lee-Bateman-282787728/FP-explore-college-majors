Taken away the sister aspect, it's essentially the same premise as ""Material Girls"": it's about a rich girl who had it all, but unfortunate circumstances left her to become poor and thus she has to rely on the people she don't know and her own strength to go through the hardship of life.  It's a beautifully-told story with a wonderful cast of gals and heartfelt direction (followed by a contrived ending).  Sure, it's a cast of children, and it's a period piece where Coco was before Chanel and the only known pop song was 'The Star-Spangle Banner', but should anyone really care about the modern stuff?  Should we have to watch girls obsessed with their own fashion sense, catering to their own vanity, and keep tabs on the latest gadgets to make IMs?  Shouldn't the heart be the important factor to a story?That's what ""Material Girls"" lack: a heart. And common sense, since the Duff sisters spend most of their screen-time saying the most asinine lines I've ever heard (""I'm not interested in Spice Girls.  I don't listen to Classic Rock"") while watching them try to do commoner's things for laughs.  Yea, I know they're suppose to be this clueless as a form of parody, but at least the movie could make them interesting enough to be more than total jokes.  Plus, they don't really develop as characters; they were being catty, materialistic, pompous dramaqueens in the beginning, and they still are in the end.  It's insufferable to watch, and yet it is a step up from ""New York Minute"" in a couple of notices.  It at least has love interests with have SOME kind of personality; at least Haylie Duff's character ends up with a dude that's sorta average-looking than the typical hunk.

I give kudos to anyone who's patient enough to watch this movie the whole way through.Material Girls stars sisters Hilary and Hayley Duff as two fictional sisters who are heiresses to a major corporation and the money it produces.  The Marchetta girls are the faces of the Marchetta cosmetics company, started by their late father, but that's all they really are - the figureheads.  The company is actually run by their father's best friend and the man who holds their company - and fortune - in trust.  When a scandal breaks loose regarding toxic ingredients in the cosmetics and facially damaging products, the sisters lose their fortune overnight and become ""poor.""  (Sort of.)  But something doesn't seem right... so they take matters into their own hands and investigate the situation.It's hard to imagine that anyone could be so clueless about the real world  and the issues that regular people face, but the Marchetta girls don't think beyond the latest fashion or party.  They're so self-focused to the point of rudeness, and it's not until the tables are turned that they realize there's a bigger world out there. (And they're still pretty rude and self-centered.)  I also found some things hard to believe - from what I could tell, the girls weren't of age (hence the ""in trust"" issue with their father's friend), and yet they're living in this huge mansion with no one to supervise them but servants.  Where's their mother?  When their house burns down they don't turn to family, they turn to their former housekeeper to take them in.This movie had potential to be a really good coming-of-age story, if the two Marchetta sisters were allowed to grow up.  As it was, once they decided to ""investigate,"" I just skipped ahead on the DVD to the very predictable ending. I was extremely disgusted with their behavior throughout most of the movie and the fact that, in spite of their hardships, they didn't seem to learn anything.  They just complained about their situation (no valets? we have to take the bus? we have to clean things?) and still managed to come out on top.There are much better movies out there that actually have the main characters grow and learn something through adversity.

Not sure about the pg rating...there's an s-word and some pretty sexual stuff, but it's not too inappropriate. Funny and enjoyable the first time, kinda funny and pretty interesting the second, okay the third. Not something I'll be watching over and over again. A good sleepover chick flick for $3. Worth the money, but you might wanna watch it first before letting little girls see.

This movie has nothing about it to offer additional points to that train of thought.  Hilary and Hayley are two spoiled brats who lose all their money, then get it back--an obvious parody of the ditzola factor the Hilton sisters live for real.  About as painful, stupid and empty as My Date with the President's Daughter (UGH!), the only redeeming thing about this vapid little teen chick flick is Anjelica Houston.  For good teen flicks that are thoroughly enjoyable, I highly recommend 10 Things I Hate About You and the old 80s classic hit, John Hughes' Sixteen Candles.
