1011989,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000HC2LXU,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[10, 14]","Quickly after watching the first season of Black Books, I jumped headfirst into the second season.  Sure, there were elements that I was unhappy with by the end of the first season, but I was excited about going forward.  I missed Bernard, Manny, and even Fran with their wit, charm, and disgust with the worldly consumer.  I, as a business owner, went into this next season with a pen in hand - eager to see and hear how this rag-tag bunch would handle the next bunch of complaints or customer service issues that entered into their shop.  Alas, this pen never quite hit the pad as I found that the wit and blasphemy from the first season somehow didn't quite conjure into the second season.  While I would agree that a typical second season to any series should develop the old characters, it should also improve the humor, take the audience to new places, and perhaps bring in some new faces - Black Books didn't seem to follow that mantra.  Instead of pushing forward, this next series felt like it was taking a step backwards.  With formulaic episodes that embarrassingly pitted Manny against Bernard (instead of working together), nearly dropped Fran's character out of the mix, and introduced us to recycled material instead of new original concepts - Black Books season two doesn't quite fit within as strong of a mold as the original series did.  Like similar BBC series (aka Chef!), Black Books leveled down to mediocrity as more funds were thrown into its direction.There is a curse surrounding furthering a series featured on BBC.  It seems that with several that I have watched (Chef! and Vicar of Dibley's Specials) once the first season passes, the BBC decides to throw more money at a potential hit and lessening the hold on the elements that mattered most - in this case - the dialogue and devilish interactions with the customers.  The first season of Black Books provided endless enjoyment of banter between Manny and Bernard (due to their polar opposite lifestyles), thus leading to cult-like quotes that would reign for eternity.  Manny and Bernard held the show together.  It was the reason that I continued to watch from beginning to end in the first place - so you can see my upset when I got into this second season only to discover the dynamics had changed.  The Manny and Bernard that I grew to love were not the same two from the original - they had changed ... dramatically.  Instead of being a couple with quips and zingers towards each other that kept us laughing with comedic response, we were introduced to two people that seemed to hate each other with utter disgust.  The friendship was still there, but you could feel less comedy more bitterness with their words towards each other.  Fran, once thought of as the anchor of the two, seemed more like a bumbling idiot that was useless and out of place.  The episode where she discovers her potential family nearly infuriated me with the intellectual-less premise and dampened concept.  What made this odd was that it was disguised very well.  The characters were there, they were doing the same motions, they were visually in a comfortable zone (i.e. a place the viewer remembered), but the words out of their mouths were not the same.  The tone of the show was completely different, and my experience was ultimately ruined.I wanted to like this season, I went in with a clean slate even with the debauchery of the final episode, but there just seemed to be a missing foundation.  Occasionally you could see it - say - in the episode where Manny and Bernard attempt to be just like the ""Big Box"" booksellers with the coffee and the full-course meal (oddly, the same episode that I hated Fran in), but the rest seemed to fall through the wayside.  Was I tired of the concept?  I don't think so because it was a relatable one, I think I expected a higher level of humor and original episodic creations, when in fact, it seemed to feel just like any other program on the television.  The uniqueness of it all had ended.  Manny and Bernard, without sound repetitive, just weren't the same.  They felt like an old married couple that we once enjoyed that now was merely staying together for their children.  It was awkward at times and completely unfunny.  While I would find myself smiling at some moments, there were other times that I just wanted this to end.  I hope that with the final season I can hopefully say that it surprised me and returned me to my favorite roots of the show, but I am not holding my breath.Overall, I cannot say that I was impressed with this second outing.  I realize that I will be a minority here, but for someone that enjoys British comedy with a passion, I just felt like this second series was formulaic and dull.  I could see where the episodes were headed before they went there, and I cannot state enough that I just missed the old crowd.  It felt like going to a High School reunion where nobody talks because there is nothing in common any further.  That first season can stand on its own, this second one - desperately needs a pair of crutches.  Maybe I can suggest one viewing, but if you want to keep a great taste in your mouth with this series - just stick with the opening act.Grade: *** out of *****",3,"Come on Bernard, show Manny some
