The story behind the film isn't complete and is ambiguous at best. But Steve McQueen changes this concept and makes Junior Bonner truly a Steve McQueen picture. Junior Bonner is a purely enjoyable cowboy movie, and when the rodeo time came, the scenes are dynamite to watch. Even the bull riding of Junior Bonner packed a lot of punch. Junior Bonner may come as a somewhat of a chaotic film, but that's how Sam Peckinpah wants this picture to be. It's a great viewing on the abstract side, capturing the lost era of American Cowboys.7/08: Junior Bonner is a great Western picture that focuses mainly on the sport of rodeo including the eight second bull riding and, most importantly of all, recaptures a lifestyle and puts it in permanent print for later generations to get a glimpse what it was like back then. It also features one of the better Steve McQueen's performances. Sam Peckinpah once again makes a beautiful picture with very distinctive editing work that is similar to The Wild Bunch. Of course, there isn't much of a story during Junior Bonner yet there are plenty of visions that breed a good deal of Americana. The additional performances by Robert Preston, Joe Don Baker (who reminds me of Michael Rooker), Ida Lupino, and Ben Johnson are satisfying to watch. I loved the introduction and the way the three-four picture screens are done which easily tops the work from The Thomas Crown Affair; the editing is the chief reason why most of Junior Bonner worked for me on entertainment level. The shots of rodeo events are treats to watch, and they are fascinatingly marvelous. When the ending happened, I knew that Sam Peckinpah made a poem out of Junior Bonner and sung it to the dying culture of Cowboys and their traditional ways. Steve McQueen is the perfect guy for that as well as for Tom Horn, two of his great Western pictures. When he plays the role, it is as if ""you can take him out of the West, but you can't take the West out of him."" I see the two brothers, Curly and Junior, having a clear difference between them, and that is explicitly shown when Curly says, ""What road? I mean, I'm workin' on my first million, and you're still workin' on eight seconds."" Some men love money, and some men love simple things. When I see the simplicity of life being replaced by modernism, I feel sadness today because I keep thinking of how things used to be in my lifetime and how they are taken out and replaced with something else that feels more artificial. All in all, Junior Bonner keeps getting better and remains a classic, and sees its rating improve from `8' to `9' from me.",5,Steve McQueen Is God.,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,2737,"['Viewed', '6/05', '7/08Rate', '96/05', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'very', 'nice', 'style', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'similar', 'vein', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'story', 'film', ""n't"", 'complete', 'ambiguous', 'best', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'concept', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'truly', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'picture', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'purely', 'enjoyable', 'cowboy', 'movie', 'when', 'rodeo', 'time', 'came', 'scenes', 'are', 'dynamite', 'watch', 'Even', 'bull', 'riding', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'packed', 'lot', 'punch', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'may', 'come', 'somewhat', 'chaotic', 'film', 'how', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'picture', 'be', 'great', 'viewing', 'abstract', 'side', 'capturing', 'lost', 'era', 'American', 'Cowboys.7/08', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'great', 'Western', 'picture', 'mainly', 'sport', 'rodeo', 'including', 'eight', 'second', 'bull', 'riding', 'most', 'importantly', 'lifestyle', 'permanent', 'print', 'later', 'generations', 'get', 'glimpse', 'what', 'was', 'back', 'then', 'also', 'one', 'better', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'performances', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'once', 'again', 'beautiful', 'picture', 'very', 'distinctive', 'editing', 'work', 'similar', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'course', ""n't"", 'much', 'story', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'yet', 'are', 'plenty', 'visions', 'breed', 'good', 'deal', 'Americana', 'additional', 'performances', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'who', 'Michael', 'Rooker', 'Ida', 'Lupino', 'Ben', 'Johnson', 'are', 'satisfying', 'watch', 'loved', 'introduction', 'way', 'three-four', 'picture', 'screens', 'are', 'done', 'easily', 'work', 'Thomas', 'Crown', 'Affair', 'editing', 'chief', 'reason', 'why', 'most', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'worked', 'entertainment', 'level', 'shots', 'rodeo', 'events', 'are', 'treats', 'watch', 'are', 'fascinatingly', 'marvelous', 'When', 'ending', 'happened', 'knew', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'made', 'poem', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'sung', 'dying', 'culture', 'Cowboys', 'traditional', 'ways', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'perfect', 'guy', 'as', 'well', 'Tom', 'Horn', 'two', 'great', 'Western', 'pictures', 'When', 'role', 'can', 'take', 'West', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'West', 'see', 'two', 'brothers', 'Curly', 'Junior', 'having', 'clear', 'difference', 'explicitly', 'shown', 'when', 'Curly', 'What', 'road', 'mean', ""'m"", 'workin', 'first', 'million', ""'re"", 'still', 'workin', 'eight', 'seconds', 'men', 'love', 'money', 'men', 'love', 'simple', 'things', 'When', 'see', 'simplicity', 'life', 'being', 'replaced', 'modernism', 'feel', 'sadness', 'today', 'keep', 'thinking', 'how', 'things', 'used', 'be', 'lifetime', 'how', 'are', 'taken', 'out', 'replaced', 'something', 'else', 'feels', 'more', 'artificial', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'getting', 'better', 'classic', 'rating', 'improve', '8', '9']",N/A
462803,A3DSTOJPRMV674,6305388865,"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[39, 40]","As a big fan of film director Sam Peckinpah and actor Steve McQueen, I always thought I had seen their most substantial work. Much to my surprise, I viewed the 1972 film ""Junior Bonner"" for the first time recently and was stunned by its quality and depth. ""Junior Bonner"" is a terrific film, complete with Peckinpah's individualistic themes, McQueen's understated though electric presence, magnificient location detail, boozy saloons and elder statesmen (and women) coming to terms with a rapidly receding past.A genre unto itself, the rodeo lifestyle was documented with surprising fervor in the early 1970s by a handful of interesting films including ""Honkers,"" ""J.W. Coop,"" and ""When the Legends Die."" Each film explored the themes of a changing civilization which embraced convention while muting individualism and personal freedom. Thus, Peckinpah and McQueen were truly in their element with ""Junior Bonner.""The film covers a day in the life of Junior Bonner (McQueen), an aging rodeo star who returns to his Arizona hometown to participate in an annual rodeo competition. We are soon introduced to his family, including his estranged parents (Robert Preston and Ida Lupino) and his budding businessman brother (Joe Don Baker) looking to profit from the sale of his father's land while exploiting the frontier/cowboy persona.""Junior Bonner"" is so understated, that the viewer must read between the lines throughout its brief running time, including a fascinating dinner scene with McQueen, Lupino and Baker when they discuss the family's future. It is a moment of brilliant directing and acting.Ironically, what is probably the least seen film of Peckinpah and McQueen's careers is also one of their best. Peckinpah has never before been so restrained, if not gentle. Known for his fierce action sequences in such films as ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""The Getaway,"" Peckinpah utilizes his detailed, frenzied style during the exciting rodeo sequences. But his handling of the more intimate moments, especially those between Preston and Lupino, are some of his most gentle scenes he ever put on film. In many ways, Preston's character is just a scruffy version of Peckinpah himself - a deeply flawed but eventually loveable dreamer. It is Peckinpah opening up to the viewer for one of the few times in his career.McQueen, likewise, plays a character very close to him as a man. The role of Junior Bonner is that of a gregarious loner, limping from the hard knocks of life, trying to quietly go about his business but discovering he can do anything but. His accent, his mannerisms and his reactions to everyday life always ring with a note of truth. It's absolutely one of his finest performances.Perhaps the film's only fault is the rather abrupt ending which seems to come out of nowhere. It's unconventional, but then again, so were Peckinpah and McQueen. Unheralded, and relatively unknown, ""Junior Bonner"" is a great film ripe for discovery. Quiet, unassuming and good natured, ""Junior Bonner"" is a perfect display of two legendary motion picture talents (Peckinpah, McQueen) exploring themes perhaps closer to their hearts than any film they ever made.",4,Still workin' on 8 seconds......,1037404800,"11 16, 2002",2002,3154,"['big', 'fan', 'film', 'director', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'actor', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'always', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'most', 'substantial', 'work', 'Much', 'surprise', 'viewed', '1972', 'film', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'first', 'time', 'recently', 'was', 'stunned', 'quality', 'depth', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'terrific', 'film', 'complete', 'Peckinpah', 'individualistic', 'themes', 'McQueen', 'understated', 'electric', 'presence', 'magnificient', 'location', 'detail', 'boozy', 'saloons', 'elder', 'statesmen', 'women', 'coming', 'terms', 'rapidly', 'receding', 'past.A', 'genre', 'rodeo', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'documented', 'surprising', 'fervor', 'early', '1970s', 'handful', 'interesting', 'films', 'including', 'Honkers', 'J.W', 'Coop', 'When', 'Legends', 'Die', 'film', 'explored', 'themes', 'changing', 'civilization', 'embraced', 'convention', 'muting', 'individualism', 'personal', 'freedom', 'Thus', 'Peckinpah', 'McQueen', 'were', 'truly', 'element', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'film', 'day', 'life', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'McQueen', 'aging', 'rodeo', 'star', 'who', 'Arizona', 'hometown', 'participate', 'annual', 'rodeo', 'competition', 'are', 'soon', 'introduced', 'family', 'including', 'estranged', 'parents', 'Robert', 'Preston', 'Ida', 'Lupino', 'budding', 'businessman', 'brother', 'Joe', 'Don', 'Baker', 'looking', 'profit', 'sale', 'father', 'land', 'exploiting', 'frontier/cowboy', 'persona', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'so', 'understated', 'viewer', 'must', 'read', 'lines', 'brief', 'running', 'time', 'including', 'fascinating', 'dinner', 'scene', 'McQueen', 'Lupino', 'Baker', 'when', 'discuss', 'family', 'future', 'moment', 'brilliant', 'directing', 'acting.Ironically', 'what', 'probably', 'least', 'seen', 'film', 'Peckinpah', 'McQueen', 'careers', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'Peckinpah', 'never', 'before', 'been', 'so', 'restrained', 'not', 'gentle', 'Known', 'fierce', 'action', 'sequences', 'such', 'films', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'Getaway', 'Peckinpah', 'detailed', 'frenzied', 'style', 'exciting', 'rodeo', 'sequences', 'handling', 'more', 'intimate', 'moments', 'especially', 'Preston', 'Lupino', 'are', 'most', 'gentle', 'scenes', 'ever', 'put', 'film', 'many', 'ways', 'Preston', 'character', 'just', 'scruffy', 'version', 'Peckinpah', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'eventually', 'loveable', 'dreamer', 'Peckinpah', 'opening', 'up', 'viewer', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'career.McQueen', 'likewise', 'character', 'very', 'close', 'man', 'role', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'gregarious', 'loner', 'limping', 'hard', 'knocks', 'life', 'trying', 'quietly', 'go', 'business', 'discovering', 'can', 'do', 'anything', 'accent', 'mannerisms', 'reactions', 'everyday', 'life', 'always', 'ring', 'note', 'truth', 'absolutely', 'one', 'finest', 'film', 'only', 'fault', 'rather', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'come', 'nowhere', 'unconventional', 'then', 'again', 'were', 'Peckinpah', 'McQueen', 'Unheralded', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'great', 'film', 'ripe', 'discovery', 'Quiet', 'unassuming', 'good', 'natured', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'perfect', 'display', 'two', 'legendary', 'motion', 'picture', 'talents', 'Peckinpah', 'McQueen', 'exploring', 'themes', 'perhaps', 'closer', 'hearts', 'film', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

It's a tribute to both legends that they eschewed vanity to create a film that feels like real life.  I don't know how long it took Peckinpah to lens this film but it feels like he just took his camera for a few days to capture the ambiance of Prescott, Arizona on a Fourth of July Weekend when the rodeo came to town.  Having never been to a rodeo or seen any films about it I found the way Peckinpah captures the people, the sights, and sounds thrilling.  Anybody whose followed the career of Steve McQueen knows that he was the master of understatement.  Here he gracefully captures the essence of an aging rodeo star who goes from one show to the next in hopes of winning the $950.00 in prize money.  Peckinpah populates the cast with legendary actors like Robert Preston, Ida Lupino, and Ben Johnson along with notable character actors like Joe Don Baker and William McKinney.  This ensemble of actors are terrific because they seem like real people who've been part of the rodeo world or Prescott landscape their whole lives.

462805,A3MAZM138KFVOW,6305388865,D. Blackdeer,"[4, 4]","Good show with Steve McQueen as former rodeo champion Junior Bonner who is past his prime and at the crossroads of life on whether he'll retire, or continue chasing the eight-second buzzer in rodeo competition. He returns to his home in Prescott, Arizona, to compete in the oldest rodeo on the circuit and have another shot at a champion bull that defeated him in previous competition. This is also a homecoming for JR and he unfortunately he finds his father, Ace Bonner (portrayed by Robert Preston), penniless and separated from his mother (Ida Lupino). Mixed into this story is his younger brother Curly (Jo Don Baker), working on his first million as a successful real estate developer and who shrewdly bought their father's ranch for a steal and sold it to a gravel company.It's a bittersweet reunion, with JR unable to help his father and tensions running high between him and Curly. Curly looks down on JR and Ace as washed-up old rodeo stars who failed to move with the times. Ace and JR live for the cowboy experience and money doesn't appear to be an issue as long as there's enough to get by and neither acknowledges Curly's success with any respect. For the moment however, there's a big rodeo to attend and that's all that matters for Ace and JR.This is a nice movie by director Sam Peckingpah, better known for his violence-packed features, portraying a father and son who were probably better suited for the 1800s, but accept life as it comes in a modern day world. Steve McQueen fits this role nicely as the likeable and noble rodeo star still trying his best. The presence of Robert Preston and Ida Lupino, and Ben Johnson as a cattle stockowner, reinforce a romantic western theme. A good country music soundtrack, excellent rodeo footage, and the location at Prescott, Arizona, round this out to an appealing feature.DVD imagery is very good and in letterbox format, music and sound are likewise.

Now, every other movie is a sequel or a retread of a comic book or crappy TV show.  Sam Peckinpah didn't play that.  His films are incredibly entertaining, challenging, and original, and Junior Bonner is one of the finest examples.  He made it right after he made one of his ugliest (and most brilliant) movies, Straw Dogs, so of course the media and the public ignored it because Junior Bonner is relatively quiet, gentle, and profoundly moving.  You want to know what happened to character development in films?  Check this out.  Peckinpah can tell you someone's life story in just a few images.  Steve McQueen, superstar, stud, and damned good actor who knows the value of understatement.  His performance as Junior is superb and consistently convincing, as are those of Robert Preston and Ida Lupino, who have some lovely, funny, touching scenes together.  Not as good as an actress, but so beautiful and sexy you might have trouble breathing, is Barbara Leigh as Junior's lust interest, whom he leaves behind at the end because it's ""rodeo time.""  Joe Don Baker is not likable as a character, but his acting is also first-rate and he's one of the few actors who got the chance to deck McQueen, even though it's a bigger scene when Steve punches him through a window.  Then's there's the photography of the sublime Lucien Ballard, who shot The Wild Bunch and other Peckinpah classics.  Peckinpah shoots rodeo action with wit and imagination, capturing minor details that add up to a rich, textured presentation of an important part of American folk culture. My favorite scenes are: the meeting between Junior and his mom; the parade in Prescott, Arizona; the conversation between Junior and his dad Ace at the train station, especially when Ace knocks off Junior's cowboy hat; and the final scence between Ace and Junior's mom.

Granted it's not as graphic as some of Peckinpah's earlier undertakings, and not quite as intense personal drama either.  But the story of J.R. Bonner, an aging cowboy and rodeo star, who has to confront the changing times, has a lot of major societal issues weaving through its pages.You have to understand the times.  In the early 1970s the American West was still quite open and quiet, but the old ways were slowly fading off and the new consumer culture was coming in.  Compared to today's dog-eat-dog economy, the late 1940s through early '70s were a socialist paradise.  Jobs paid well, housing was affordable, and the executives didn't run off with seven- or eight-figure salaries.  But the system became a victim of its own success as the middle class got wealthier and began to move around and buy bigger (and second) homes.  Greed slipped back in, in real estate but also in the general public ideology.JR, visiting in Prescott, Arizona for the 4th of July, is looking for his dad Ace, and sees a huge excavation pit and housing subdivision going up. Ace seems all too willing to go along with brother Curly, who is profiting from a mobile home development named after him.  The Bonner family plans to move into a subdivision and work for the company.  They don't realize how unfair the land deal was and how stifling the new way of life may be for them.  Especially JR, who wants none of it.  The conflict between JR and Curly over the future of the world they live in becomes important.One can look at this theme two ways:  Perhaps JR sees the new residents as foreigners who threaten the traditional cowboy way of life.  Many are from the east and are used to things like golf courses, shopping malls and tract housing.  Or maybe the real problem is the capitalist greed of Curly Bonner and his development agenda.  None of it seems like authentic country life but a silly commercialized mockery of it.JR doesn't seem like a raging idealist out to save the world, though.  He just wants his freedom to live and do what he loves with animals in the rodeo.  He isn't the perfect gentleman but not a mega-chauvinist either.  The arena and the bullfights are his symbol of identity and the fight he is leading in his heart to resist what is happening to his family.  Ace wants to search for gold in Australia, which everyone else thinks is silly.There could have been more development in the conflict between the two brothers, something to bring it to a dramatic climax.  And maybe the rodeo events should have been spaced out a little more over time to get a feeling for life on the road.  But then, there's only so much time and space in one movie...Definitely close to the heart of the anti-sprawl crowd, the history crowd, the social vision crowd, not to mention the rodeo crowd.  So why wasn't it a big success?  American audiences seem to prefer thrills over social conscience, and this movie takes a deeper conscience to truly enjoy.  It was ahead of the times as well, anticipating a trend that has gone so much further in the 34 years since this film was written.  Perhaps that is why it is enjoying a second fame today.",4,The reason this was underappreciated,1158624000,"09 19, 2006",2006,3226,"['JUNIOR', 'BONNER', 'more', 'worldly', 'land', 'rodeo', 'slow', 'decline', 'Granted', 'not', 'as', 'graphic', 'Peckinpah', 'earlier', 'undertakings', 'not', 'quite', 'intense', 'personal', 'drama', 'either', 'story', 'J.R.', 'Bonner', 'aging', 'cowboy', 'rodeo', 'star', 'who', 'confront', 'changing', 'times', 'lot', 'major', 'societal', 'issues', 'weaving', 'pages.You', 'have', 'understand', 'times', 'early', '1970s', 'American', 'West', 'was', 'still', 'quite', 'open', 'quiet', 'old', 'ways', 'were', 'slowly', 'fading', 'off', 'new', 'consumer', 'culture', 'was', 'coming', 'Compared', 'today', 'dog-eat-dog', 'economy', 'late', '1940s', 'early', ""'70s"", 'were', 'socialist', 'paradise', 'Jobs', 'paid', 'well', 'housing', 'was', 'affordable', 'executives', 'did', ""n't"", 'run', 'off', 'seven-', 'eight-figure', 'salaries', 'system', 'became', 'victim', 'own', 'success', 'middle', 'class', 'got', 'wealthier', 'began', 'move', 'around', 'buy', 'bigger', 'second', 'homes', 'Greed', 'slipped', 'back', 'real', 'estate', 'also', 'general', 'public', 'ideology.JR', 'visiting', 'Prescott', 'Arizona', '4th', 'July', 'looking', 'dad', 'Ace', 'huge', 'excavation', 'pit', 'housing', 'subdivision', 'going', 'up', 'Ace', 'too', 'willing', 'go', 'along', 'brother', 'Curly', 'who', 'profiting', 'mobile', 'home', 'development', 'named', 'Bonner', 'family', 'plans', 'move', 'subdivision', 'work', 'company', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'unfair', 'land', 'deal', 'was', 'how', 'stifling', 'new', 'way', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'Especially', 'JR', 'who', 'none', 'conflict', 'JR', 'Curly', 'future', 'world', 'live', 'becomes', 'important.One', 'can', 'look', 'theme', 'two', 'ways', 'Perhaps', 'JR', 'new', 'residents', 'foreigners', 'who', 'threaten', 'traditional', 'cowboy', 'way', 'life', 'Many', 'are', 'east', 'are', 'used', 'things', 'golf', 'courses', 'shopping', 'malls', 'tract', 'housing', 'maybe', 'real', 'problem', 'capitalist', 'greed', 'Curly', 'Bonner', 'development', 'agenda', 'None', 'authentic', 'country', 'life', 'silly', 'commercialized', 'mockery', 'it.JR', ""n't"", 'seem', 'raging', 'idealist', 'save', 'world', 'though', 'just', 'freedom', 'live', 'do', 'what', 'animals', 'rodeo', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'gentleman', 'not', 'mega-chauvinist', 'either', 'arena', 'bullfights', 'are', 'symbol', 'identity', 'fight', 'leading', 'heart', 'resist', 'what', 'happening', 'family', 'Ace', 'search', 'gold', 'Australia', 'everyone', 'else', 'silly.There', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'development', 'conflict', 'two', 'brothers', 'something', 'bring', 'dramatic', 'climax', 'maybe', 'rodeo', 'events', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spaced', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'get', 'feeling', 'life', 'road', 'then', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'space', 'one', 'movie', 'Definitely', 'close', 'heart', 'anti-sprawl', 'crowd', 'history', 'crowd', 'social', 'vision', 'crowd', 'not', 'mention', 'rodeo', 'crowd', 'So', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'success', 'American', 'audiences', 'seem', 'prefer', 'thrills', 'social', 'conscience', 'movie', 'deeper', 'conscience', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'was', 'ahead', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'anticipating', 'trend', 'gone', 'so', 'much', 'further', '34', 'years', 'film', 'was', 'written', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'enjoying', 'second', 'fame', 'today']",N/A

This movie has noise (at the rodeo)  and some action (a bar fight, and the rodeo) and a little blood (from a brotherly dispute). But this is a movie about a family. They may not be a perfect family as most of us imagine a perfect family -- the Waltons they certainly are not -- but they love each other. The father was a rodeo champion years ago, and now dreams of finding gold in Australia.  He can't stick in any one place or with any one idea for long. One son followed him into rodeo, and now finds himself becoming a little slower, a little stiffer, a little less quick to heal, and winning less often, but, unlike his father, he has no intention of quitting; the only place he really feels at home is on the road or in the saddle. The other son is trying to keep the family and the town going; he bought the family ranch when his dad needed money to go off chasing his dreams, and he is riding a real estate boom, selling trailers to retirees as Reata Rancheros. The mother still loves her husband, thoughtless, repetitive and irritating as he is, but she doesn't count on him for anything in the long run but disappointment.Both Peckinpah and McQueen knew this was a small, quiet movie that needed to build an audience by word of mouth but the studio gave it the big opening weekend release they would have used for any action movie and they marketed it as such.

As far as story and action, this is not one of McQueen's best but he does bring his persona to the screen. As many reviewers have said, it's hard to believe this film was directed by Sam Peckinpah. Peckinpah must have calmed the violence for JUNIOR BONNER. It's far from a typical Peckinpah film.It is disappointing to see such a fine actor in a bland film. McQueen gives his best, as usual, but this film relies on endless rodeo footage and much less on characters. If you like rodeos, JUNIOR BONNER is probably one of the best rodeo films. A fine cast is wasted in this film - Ida Lupino, Roberto Preston, Ben Johnson and Joe Don Baker. There is dissention in the Bonner family but we really never completely understand why and everyone is just there for the rodeo.

Great script, superb acting, and as they say in the commentary, ""not just good editing, perfect editing."" Like many contemporary Westerns, the script laments a lost era, but more important to the genre, Bonner reflects the ethos of the pioneering West.Peckinpah was a great director. My favorite Peckinpah films were Junior Bonner andThe Ballad of Cable Hogue. Both are great character studies. The films showed that Peckinpah didn't need slow motion violence to tell a good story.It occurred to me that Junior Bonner shares similarities withDownhill Racer (The Criterion Collection), which starred Robert Redford. The films show how a good story can sometimes present a more realistic picture than a documentary. Both films revealed the nature of lone athletes compelled to compete against themselves. There are many great team-sport movies, but these films captured the primal culture of individual sports. Redford and McQueen also have never acted with more subtlety.  Even if you don't care about rodeo or skiing, these movies bring you into a fascinating world very unlike the way most of us live.One last note: The Junior Bonner DVD also has an excellent commentary that ought to be listened to by every film student or film enthusiast.",5,"Great script, superb acting, and ""perfect editing""",1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,1312,"['recently', 'watched', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'again', 'exceptional', 'film', 'Great', 'script', 'superb', 'acting', 'say', 'commentary', 'not', 'just', 'good', 'editing', 'perfect', 'editing', 'many', 'contemporary', 'Westerns', 'script', 'lost', 'era', 'more', 'important', 'genre', 'Bonner', 'ethos', 'pioneering', 'West.Peckinpah', 'was', 'great', 'director', 'My', 'favorite', 'Peckinpah', 'films', 'were', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'Ballad', 'Cable', 'Hogue', 'are', 'great', 'character', 'studies', 'films', 'showed', 'Peckinpah', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'slow', 'motion', 'violence', 'tell', 'good', 'story.It', 'occurred', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'shares', 'similarities', 'withDownhill', 'Racer', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'starred', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'films', 'show', 'how', 'good', 'story', 'can', 'sometimes', 'present', 'more', 'realistic', 'picture', 'documentary', 'films', 'revealed', 'nature', 'lone', 'athletes', 'compelled', 'compete', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'team-sport', 'movies', 'films', 'captured', 'primal', 'culture', 'individual', 'sports', 'Redford', 'McQueen', 'also', 'have', 'never', 'acted', 'more', 'subtlety', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'rodeo', 'skiing', 'movies', 'bring', 'fascinating', 'world', 'very', 'way', 'most', 'live.One', 'last', 'note', 'Junior', 'Bonner', 'DVD', 'also', 'excellent', 'commentary', 'ought', 'be', 'listened', 'film', 'student', 'film', 'enthusiast']",N/A

Which isn't to say that Peckinpah is not excising his usual demons--the indvidual at odds with his society, the conflict of the man who is out of sync with his times.  But this time he does it with not a geyser of blood nor dead body (nor dead bodies) in sight.  Instead, he gives us a couple days in the life of an on-the-verge-of-being-a-has-been rodeo rider returning to his hometown rodeo.  The truth is, not much happens in this film.  Junior Bonner, in the old western tradition of a ""man's gotta do what a man's gotta do"", gets another shot at the bull that threw him just days before.  We meet his older brother who has thrown in his lot with developers that are inevitably destroying the very West they exploit.  We meet his na'er-do-well Dad and his daffy dreams of striking it rich in Australia.  And we meet his Mother, dependent on her successful son, bitter over the dissolution of the man she married as well as her marriage, but still onery.  Like Peckinpah's best films, this is really a character study of people at odds with their world, each other, and themselves, but who yet find dignity and grace in the worst of situations.  The performances are first-rate all around: Steve McQueen not afraid to make a little fun of his famous macho persona; the same for Robert Preston and usually tough guy Joe Don Baker; and best of all, Ida Lupino, playing a role that doesn't exist in contenmporary American movies, a fully realized middle-aged woman.  Again, not much happens, but by the time you get to the end of this tiny gem, you realize everything has happened, for  we get a real sense of life and the complicated choices it tosses at us.

And who could better personify such a man than Steve McQueen, who plays the title role in ""Junior Bonner,"" director Sam Peckinpah's character study of a man so determined to live life on his own terms that the only challenge that means anything to him is the one he makes with himself.  When Junior says, ""Rodeo time, I gotta get it on down the road,"" it's his way of saying, ""Life awaits.""  His life; and he's working it in such a way that whenever he gets to the end, he's going to be able to look back and say unequivocally, ""I did it my way.""  That's the challenge.

And who he is and what he's all about becomes perfectly clear when the circuit takes him back home to Prescott, Arizona, for a Fourth of July show.  When he hits town, Junior approaches Buck Roan, the man who owns the rodeo stock and will be overseeing the draw for the bull ride; Junior wants to ride Sunshine, the meanest, toughest bull in the bunch, and he's willing to pay for the privilege-- he'll pay to ride the very bull that most cowboys would pay to stay off of.

I need it--""In the meantime, Junior reconnects with his family:  Ace, who is still looking for that gold ring, living on the memories of his forty plus years riding the rodeo, and dreaming of a new start in Australia; Elvira (Ida Lupino), his mom, who has long suffered Ace's fantasies; and his brother, Curley (Joe Don Baker), a successful entrepreneur who wants Junior to hang up the rodeo and come to work for him selling mobile homes-- which he has to know is never going to happen.  The difference between Curley and Junior, in fact, is summed up when Curley says to him, ""I'm working on my first million, you're still working on eight seconds...""Stylistically rendered, Peckinpah's film is affecting, and at times almost disarmingly sincere.  Junior's relationship with Ace, for example, is so subtly underscored with honesty that it rings true-to-life and gives a perspective to both characters that is contextually invaluable.  The way Peckinpah presents it is definitive, as is the way in which Junior relates to Elvira, Curley, and even the rodeo itself.  It's Peckinpah's way of examining the individualist, beginning with the outstanding screenplay by Jeb Rosebrook, then by setting a perfect pace and utilizing some imaginative split-screen photography and slow motion shots to great effect.  And, as with all of Peckinpah's films, there's a sense of violence-- understated here, less pronounced than that of say, ""The Wild Bunch""-- but present, nevertheless; you can feel it, lying just beneath the surface of all that's happening, but definitely there.  You can see it in the confrontation between the cowboys and the bulls they ride; in the way Junior lives his life, that constant challenge of man against beast or against nature; or in the bulldozers razing an old ranch house, grinding down the old and weak in favor of the new and the strong.  It's pure Peckinpah, and it's brilliant filmmaking.Tough, adamant, iconoclastic; Steve McQueen was the perfect choice for the role of Junior.  One of the most underrated actors ever, he has a daunting magnetism and a commanding screen presence that allows him to dominate any scene if he so chooses, and he doesn't have to be the guy doing the talking to do it.  Consider his scenes with Preston; Ace may have the lines, but your attention is drawn to and focused on Junior.  And everything McQueen does tells you something about who Junior is, from the way he walks-- has he spent a lifetime astride broncos and bulls?  You bet-- to the way his hat sits on his head.  It's the kind of natural and detailed performance that sets McQueen apart, and looking back on this character, and on his whole body of work, you can say without hesitation that he did it his way.  This is one gifted, singular actor who never gives less than 110%.  And there will never be another like him.Preston, too, is memorable as Ace, a man who, if not larger than life himself, has dreams that are.  You can tell Junior is cut from the same cloth, though Ace still thinks there's going to be gold for the taking around the next bend, if only he can get there.  Junior, though, has been there and knows there's nothing around that bend but the next rodeo-- which for him is enough.  The biggest difference between them is the fact that Ace still seems to have the need to prove himself to the world, while Junior has nothing to prove to anyone but himself.  There's something of ""The Music Man's"" Prof. Harold Hill in Ace, but overall Ace is unique, and Preston plays him to perfection.An absorbing drama that captures a sense of time and place that no longer seems to exist, ""Junior Bonner"" is a glimpse at a dying breed, the individual who takes life head-on without trying to put a spin or a ""politically correct"" perspective on it.  Like Junior said, ""There's one of him, and one of me.""  And that about sums it up.  It's the magic of the movies.",5,"""There's One Of Him, and One of Me--""",1012694400,"02 3, 2002",2002,5614,"['true', 'individual', 'will', 'carve', 'out', 'niche', 'life', 'gravitate', 'endeavors',

462822,A14I90JCYYG9SI,6305388865,Robert M. Khoury,"[6, 6]","Did Steve McQueen ever deliver a bad performance on film?  This film is no exception.  Although it is rarely shown on TV, due to its subject matter, and the huge popularity of McQueen's action films, this is a wonderful film.  The cast is wonderful, beginning, of course, with McQueen, and the characters are deep and personal.  You won't be able to find a single flaw in their performances or the &quot;little&quot; story.  It's about a man who is still doing his best to be true to old-fashioned values and ideals that the modern world has forgotten and discarded.  Follow McQueen's eyes, always.  Don't take your eyes off his.  His eyes will tell you the story in every one of his films.  I believe this is one of his best performances simply because there is so much of the man in the character he portrays.  Read a McQueen biography.  There are several that are worthy.  He was the last film star with charisma.  (I don't know what it is either, but I know it when I see it.)  All I know is that his best work was done in roles like this one, when he portrays characters that are out of their proper time, and misplaced in a world that no longer values, and has no place for, honor, integrity, courage, loyalty, honesty, humility, dedication, or even knows where they come from.  When I watch a Steve McQueen film like this one (The Getaway is another example) it makes me feel good.  It's not because he is always the victor, or because the &quot;bad guys&quot; are always defeated, but because he makes trying to live by those ideals, and never giving up, look so honorable and so noble that it makes me want to keep trying, too.  He makes me feel that it's better to live life his way, and be a loser, than to be a success in a world without feeling, meaning, or emotion.",5,You Can't Take Your Eyes Off His!,1003795200,"10 23, 2001",2001,1779,"['Did', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'ever', 'bad', 'performance', 'film', 'film', 'exception', 'rarely', 'shown', 'TV', 'due', 'subject', 'matter', 'huge', 'popularity', 'McQueen', 'action', 'films', 'wonderful', 'film', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'beginning', 'course', 'McQueen', 'characters', 'are', 'deep', 'personal', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'find', 'single', 'flaw', 'performances', 'quot', 'little', 'quot', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'still', 'doing', 'best', 'be', 'true', 'old-fashioned', 'values', 'ideals', 'modern', 'world', 'forgotten', 'discarded', 'Follow', 'McQueen', 'eyes', 'always', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'eyes', 'will', 'tell', 'story', 'one', 'films', 'believe', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'simply', 'so', 'much', 'man', 'character', 'Read', 'McQueen', 'biography', 'are', 'several', 'are', 'worthy', 'was', 'last', 'film', 'star', 'charisma', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'either', 'know', 'when', 'see', 'know', 'best', 'work', 'was', 'done', 'roles', 'one', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'proper', 'time', 'misplaced', 'world', 'no', 'longer', 'values', 'place', 'honor', 'integrity', 'courage', 'loyalty', 'honesty', 'humility', 'dedication', 'even', 'knows', 'where', 'come', 'When', 'watch', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'film', 'one', 'Getaway', 'example', 'feel', 'good', 'not', 'always', 'victor', 'quot', 'bad', 'guys', 'quot', 'are', 'always', 'defeated', 'trying', 'live', 'ideals', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'look', 'so', 'honorable', 'so', 'noble', 'want', 'keep', 'trying', 'too', 'feel', 'better', 'live', 'life', 'way', 'be', 'loser', 'be', 'success', 'world', 'feeling', 'meaning', 'emotion']",N/A

462825,AK61LQI92GTCH,6305388865,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[10, 23]","JUNIOR BONNER is a flat, aimless, meandering, unfocused and unrewarding character study of an aging rodeo star.  Steve McQueen stars, Sam Peckinpah directs, and how these two titans could have combined for such a disappointing movie is beyond me.  There's a story, of sorts, and a slender plot thread that is more or less ignored.  Aging rodeo circuit rider Junior Bonner (sometimes referred to as J.R.) has recently been thrown and injured by Sunshine, one of those red-eyed, two-ton, jet black bulls that seem 90% mean shoulder muscle and 10% goring horn.  Bonner's next stop is Prescott, Arizona, to compete in yet another rodeo and visit the family.  Father Ace Bonner (Robert Preston) is hospitalized after an auto accident, and younger brother Curly (Joe Don Baker) is selling off the family estate for gaudy chunks of cash.  Ace wants a $5000 grubstake to relocate to Australia and mine for gold.  It's a dream of his.  Curly's got the old man on a strict allowance, though, and won't contribute a dime to the old man's crackpot scheme.So the main plot pivot point is reached early enough, and you'd think it sturdy enough.  Can Junior draw Sunshine again in the Prescott Rodeo and, most importantly, ride well enough and stay on the bull's back long enough (8 seconds) to win the competition and get pa his grubstake?  Okay, maybe it is kind of a light thread to hang a major movie on, but JUNIOR BONNER is more character study than action movie, and with McQueen in front of the camera and Peckinpah behind it the `character' part of it ought to be a lot more interesting than it is.  But nothing happens, at least nothing that stinks enough of drama to pull this movie up out of its terminal funk.  Junior, who lives according to a code diametrically opposed to Curly's, has a showdown or two with his younger brother, but they're a fizzle.  The most likely candidate for dramatic tension - Junior's second date with Sunshine - is treated as an afterthought.  Peckinpah punctuates the movie with an inordinate amount of documentary footage.  There's the mandatory scenes of real rodeo stars in real rodeo competition.  There's also an extended documentary sequence shot at a Prescott Fourth of July parade.  Such insertions usually add an authentic atmosphere to a movie, but they're also favored by inept director as filler.  Smells like filler here, and the sad thing is the documentary shots are the most interesting part of the movie.Steve McQueen was a great movie star and Sam Peckinpah was a great director.  Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch is one of the top two or three westerns ever, and his Ride the High Country is a neglected classic.  That McQueen and Peckinpah would be attracted to an apparent modern-day maverick, like an itinerant rodeo star, is understandable.  That they'd make a low key and boring movie is unfortunate.  Having a handful of rodeo movies under my belt I'm convinced you can't make a good movie out of this likely subject.  The problem, as always, is bridging the gap between inspiration and execution.  Rodeo stars seem a natural, but where do you take them?

Bonner is a well-known rodeo cowboy on the last legs of his rodeo career.  Returning to his hometown of Prescott, Arizona for Frontier Days, the annual 4th of July celebration, Bonner finds that everything he knew before has changed.  His father refuses to take responsibility for his life, instead always looking for a way to make easy money while alienating his wife.  J.R.'s brother has become a real estate afficionado and is only worried about the bottom line.  At the same time, JR has a burning desire to finish off strong by riding and conquering the rodeo's meanest bull for the full eight seconds.  I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie.  It is a very understated, self-reflexive film, unlike some of Peckinpah's other films.  It is an excellent story about changing times and a family's effort to survive those changes.  If you like the teaming of star Steve McQueen and director Sam Peckinpah, check out their other collaboration together, The Getaway.  I highly recommend both movies.Steve McQueen is great as the quiet rodeo cowboy, Junior Bonner, who finds everything in his life is changing, and he can do very little about it.  During his career, McQueen perfected the quiet, loner type, and this is a perfect example.  Robert Preston is also very good as Ace Bonner, JR's father who refuses to let anyone or anything change him.  Ida Lupino plays Elvira Bonner, JR's mother who will not forgive Ace for going out on his own and leaving his family.  Peckinpah regular Ben Johnson plays Buck Roan, Junior's good friend and owner of the rodeo.  Joe Don Baker plays Curly, Junior's real estate brother.  The movie also stars Barbara Leigh, Mary Murphy, Bill McKinney, and Dub Taylor.  The DVD offers widescreen presentation and commentary from three Sam Peckinpah biographers.
