For example, this crime program is populated by police officers and criminals who are in many cases, the ""genuine article,"" and there is no obvious difference between these real-deal folks and the show's ACTUAL actors. Thus, we can score one for verisimilitude.  (Actually, score two.)I'd also like to point out that if you're a fan of this show and you haven't read teleplay writer and novelist George Pellecanos's work yet, get to it.

874715,AL9HZLZT4X1KL,B0006V4KY0,CV Rick,"[0, 0]","My friend, Rose, told me I'd love The Wire.  She was right.  She said it was a great show and that I'd be caught up in fabulous dialogue and I was, but there are three other reasons that this HBO Series haunts my thoughts, three reasons I'm going to explain without giving away any spoilers:1. While it's a magnificent modern story, it's told in the classic hero's journey style.2. It feels real - the setting, characters, situations, and story all feel as if somewhere it's playing out in real life.3. It fulfills my own obsession regarding the potential transition of the novel as television series.The Hero's JourneyJoseph Campbell, noted for his study of the monomyth, posited that all the greatest stories from cultures worldwide had similar elements and could be framed by a structure called the hero's journey.  In this journey a reluctant hero, usually an outsider from his own kind, must undertake a hazardous journey where he confronts the demons of the world and the demons in his own mind.  In The Wire there are three separate heroes from three distinct societies in modern Baltimore, Maryland.The first is Jimmy McNulty, an Irish detective who has an aversion to authority and doesn't care what bridges he burns in his obsessive quest to close a case. Not just any case though, McNulty must solve the big case, the important case, in order to exorcise his self-destructive internal demons of alcoholism and relationship sabotage.  Throughout the series you get the feeling that he's always on the ledge windmilling his arms to keep from plummeting to his death.  In his journey, McNulty has to fail more than he succeeds and he has to come to terms with the fact that he's not going to make that big score without help.  He has to discover somewhere within his nature the ability to be loyal and he has to accept his own fallibility before he can really do some good.The second hero is a junkie named Bubbles.  His journey is all too common, it's the rock bottom dive of addiction and the struggle to drag himself up one day at a time. He's our advocate for the victims of the drug society, ignored by authorities until there's an exploitation opportunity, abused and bled dry by dealers and thugs.  From Bubble's perspective we learn the true meaning of despair and yet we also see the few shreds of beauty in war-torn Gangland, U.S.A.  Precisely because he'll never be missed if he dies, because there's never-ending line of junkies to take his place, we're tied to Bubbles.  We're seeing him as a human being with the potential to journey back from the depths of Hell and rejoin our America.  He has the farthest to go and the most difficult tasks ahead of him, Bubbles is the quintessential underdog.The third hero at first appears anything but.  He is Omar Little and his self-described occupation: ""I robs drug dealers.""  He's a stick-up man; Jesse James of the drug community.  He hits dealers and money men and all the corner boys scatter when he walks down the street.  ""Omar's Coming,"" is a common refrain as the boys scatter like roaches encountering bright light.  He carries two trademark weapons, a pistol-grip 12-gage shotgun and a Desert Eagle 50 caliber pistol.  Omar's journey is that of a hero with a code.  He's one of the most honorable characters on the show and despite his role as an obvious outlaw, he doesn't break that code for any price.  It's true that he's a predator, the most dangerous shark in the bay, but he's also the force that balances good and evil, for who else are the drug dealers going to fear?  Oh, did I mention that Omar is openly gay?  Flaming and scary as hell, especially when he wants to go out for his Honey Nut Cheerios.I've never seen a story that successfully brought three separate heroes along their quests and managed to interweave these stories until now, until The Wire.  In that way it's masterful, exceeding the master, James Joyce and his classic hero narrative, Finnegan's Wake.The Wire Feels Real.David Simon was a police reporter at The Baltimore Sun for twelve years.  It's this experience that gives the story and creative concept its validity.  But it seems that wasn't enough for Simon to create the show.  Various consultants and crew members come from the very societies showcased in the series. He has former drug dealers and cops and junkies advising him on what it's like, how it feels, how it looks, sounds, and smells.  The show is nothing if not detailed.  There aren't grand cops and robber shootouts or magnificent courtroom closing speeches because in real life a shootout lasts only long enough for a bullet to find a target and rarely does a case make its way to the courtroom when out of court settlement is expedient.When Bubbles pushes his shopping cart down the street, you hear the needles crack under his beat-up shoes. When Omar appears out of nowhere to respond to a message on the street, he scares you, you can smell his sweat and nicotine.  When Stringer Bell meets with his developers you can feel the tension like a man out of place, trying to fit in.  It's like Deadwood was in its attention to detail.The Novel as Television.Simon is an experienced book author (Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood) and when it came to The Wire he ""saw it as a visual novel, with each season a distinct chapter exploring an aspect of inner-city life.""That's what I've often said, that a great novel can only really be told visually through a series-length television show.  A two or three hour movie can't do justice to the characters, plots, subplots and tension of a novel.  The Wire has proven it, because this is the perfect vehicle for telling this perfect story.Enjoy it.  It's a beautiful piece of art.- CV Rick, April 2008",5,The Novel as Television,1207612800,"04 8, 2008",2008,5790,"['friend', 'Rose', 'told', ""'d"", 'love', 'Wire', 'was', 'right', 'said', 'was',

874718,A1FF2KROA1D87,B0006V4KY0,Denise P,"[0, 0]","One of the best series on TV.  Runs at least neck and neck, I think better then the Sopranos.The characters are fascinating and complex.  Some of the best story telling and acting I've seen in a long time.  The characters personalities are compelling and captivating.  You just get hooked.I was a Soprano's snob.  I just felt it was the best thing on TV and safely tucked away in Jersey so I didn't have to think about the crimes affecting my life.Before I viewed The Wire, I guess I didn't want to be bothered with the whole urban crime thing, especially so close to home.  I felt like what on earth could these kids, with pants hanging down to there knees and rap music blasting have to say that's intelligent?I found that the crime hierarchy is so much like the Sopranos, organized to the point of being genius.  I found just like the Sopranos there is a Family like element, but a brutality that is unbelievable.There are characters you will love but know they are paid to kill.  Characters you find ultimately ruthless almost with animal cunning.  Then you will find some characters eloquent in there lifestyle and speech.Among the characters in Season one, a young dealer who lives in a condemned building with about 6 little elementary school kids.  He buys food for them and sends them off to school.  He's lost with no parents like those kids.  The show isn't preachy in any way.  It just is.Also The Wire is about both sides of the coin.  The police officers, politics, and lifestyles are just as riveting.  Cops that drink too much, have an awful family life, fighting with ex's, or not giving a damn.I think it's not as popular as the Sopranos because there aren't a lot of big time stars in it although there are local actors and cameos by some well known artists.Please take a look at this outstanding series; you'll be glad you did.",5,The Best HBO has to Offer,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,1847,"['One', 'best', 'series', 'TV', 'least', 'neck', 'neck', 'think', 'better', 'then', 'Sopranos.The', 'characters', 'are', 'fascinating', 'complex', 'best', 'story', 'telling', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'characters', 'personalities', 'are', 'compelling', 'captivating', 'just', 'get', 'hooked.I', 'was', 'Soprano', 'snob', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'TV', 'safely', 'tucked', 'away', 'Jersey', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'think', 'crimes', 'affecting', 'life.Before', 'viewed', 'Wire', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'bothered', 'whole', 'urban', 'crime', 'thing', 'especially', 'so', 'close', 'home', 'felt', 'what', 'earth', 'could', 'kids', 'pants', 'hanging', 'down', 'there', 'knees', 'rap', 'music', 'blasting', 'have', 'say', 'intelligent', 'found', 'crime', 'hierarchy', 'so', 'much', 'Sopranos', 'organized', 'point', 'being', 'genius', 'found', 'just', 'Sopranos', 'Family', 'element', 'brutality', 'unbelievable.There', 'are', 'characters', 'will', 'love', 'know', 'are', 'paid', 'kill', 'Characters', 'find', 'ultimately', 'ruthless', 'almost', 'animal', 'cunning', 'Then', 'will', 'find', 'characters', 'eloquent', 'lifestyle', 'speech.Among', 'characters', 'Season', 'one', 'young', 'dealer', 'who', 'condemned', 'building', '6', 'little', 'elementary', 'school', 'kids', 'food', 'off', 'school', 'lost', 'parents', 'kids', 'show', ""n't"", 'preachy', 'way', 'just', 'is.Also', 'Wire', 'sides', 'coin', 'police', 'officers', 'politics', 'lifestyles', 'are', 'just', 'riveting', 'Cops', 'drink', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'awful', 'family', 'life', 'fighting', 'ex', 'not', 'giving', 'damn.I', 'think', 'not', 'as', 'popular', 'Sopranos', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'big', 'time', 'stars', 'are', 'local', 'actors', 'cameos', 'well', 'known', 'artists.Please', 'take', 'look', 'outstanding', 'series', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",The Wire - The Complete First and Second Seasons
