It's funny the things Anna (played by Amy Adams) goes through to get to her boyfriend in Dublin, Ireland to ask him to marry her on February 29th - Leap Year.

1332634,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,B0038N9X3G,A. Boston,"[113, 117]","I love romantic comedies and got really excited when I recently saw the preview for Leap Year. I love Amy Adams and remembered Matthew Goode from a few other movies(Chasing Liberty, Watchmen, Match Point). Lately, there have been a lot of romcoms that don't do it for me, they're just lacking the heart, that certain something. Thankfully, Leap Year had heart, laughs and was just all around a well done movie. 24 hours after seeing it, my boyfriend and I were still talking about how much we liked it.The premise is that Anna(Amy Adams) has been dating her doctor boyfriend for 4 years, they're buying an apartment together in Boston, and she wants to get engaged, but he hasn't asked. So she plans to surprise him in Dublin while he's away on business on the one day in Irish tradition that says the woman can propose to the man, Feb 29th of a leap year. Of course, her trip doesn't go as planned, and she ends up needing help getting to Dublin from Declan(Matthew Goode).While predictable as far as romantic comedies go, it was fast paced, funny and romantic. We both really liked Matthew Goode's character and his sense of humor. He was excellent as a multi-faceted leading man. I love Amy Adams because she seems like a regular girl(funny, sweet, not a twig)and she was perfect for the role of Anna. The scenery of Ireland was gorgeous, and makes you want to take a trip there. Definitely a great date movie, worth paying to see.Unfortunately, no good special features on the DVD, only some deleted scenes. I'm a sucker for ""making of"" featurettes and thought they might at least have done a little something about filming in Ireland.

This particular version of the story is not a whole lot different than most, other than in the setting which happens to be Ireland. That being said, it's still not a bad little movie. I'm giving it four stars because the chemistry isn't terribly great, the characters aren't terribly memorable and there's nothing terribly fresh in the story-line. On the other hand, there aren't too many scenes that make you grimace with embarrassment for the actors and there are actually a few nice little scenes with some genuine feeling to them.

1332646,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0038N9X3G,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 9]","Some films just look back from the get-go.  You see the trailer and it's littered with horrible clich&eacute;s and complete rip-offs from other films and you know that nothing about the film could redeem its unapologetic take at complete and total unoriginality.  `Leap Year' was one of those movies.  From the first few moments of the `all too familiar' trailer, I saw every other romantic comedy made in the past decade or more.  Even the runaway car was a disgusting attempt to capitalize on that one slice of slapstick nostalgia we see redone and redone time and time again.  I still don't know why I saw this film, but I blame it solely on the wife and the fact that the conundrum that is Amy Adams continues to haunt me.  I mean, is she a good actress?  I ask this only because she is either outstanding (`Junebug') or horrifically mediocre (`Julie and Julia').  Here, she shows enough charm to scrounge her way through the task of allowing an unattractive man to take her to Ireland so she can propose to her even uglier boyfriend (who looks like a lesbian).  There was a moment, after their kiss (the one they are forced into) where she exhibits a depth of character the screenplay doesn't allow her, but it was minor.  I love her though and will continue to.  She has far more hits than misses, that's for sure.  Alas, this film is probably her worst.  It is laboriously underdeveloped and it doesn't care that all of its best moments are stolen from `the best of the worst' in this genre.

What I loved about this movie was that it was good, clean, laugh out loud entertainment.  Anna is on a mission - to propose to her boyfriend who is on a doctor's convention in Ireland. The catch is, she is on a limited time schedule because she wants to do it on Leap Year day, following an age-old Irish tradition where the woman asks for the man's hand in marriage.  She ends up having one laughable setback after another along the way, but despite everything, she's determined to keep plowing forward to reach her boyfriend by the 29th. Very soon after setting foot in Ireland, she meets and hires Declan, the owner of a pub,  who agrees to drive her to Dublin.  The setbacks continue, along with their banter that switches between genuine annoyance with each other and a growing attraction.  One of my favorite scenes is when Ann is excitedly laughing and sharing about proposing on Leap Year and she thinks Declan is laughing along with her about the romance of it all, only to realize that he's not laughing with her, but at her.

I was surprised, if not shocked, how really good this was in nearly every aspect. Acting is first rate. Amy Adams reminded me of a mix of Nicole Kidman and Grace Kelly. This actress is going to be a big star. Played her part perfectly, with some nice comedic touches. Matthew Goode also excellent. Nailed the part. Script was very well written, great dialogue and romantic banter between the two. Without giving any of the plot away, I was fooled several times thinking it would be predictable. Nope. Which is just another reason why this is an excellent film. And then there's the beautiful photography of rural ireland. Wow! I'm gonna buy the blue-ray just for that. And also because it's just a nice, fun, and well-made film.

(Spoilers ahead) Anna follows her boyfriend(Jeremy) of 4 years to Dublin after not receiving an engament ring on their anniversary. Irish tradition states that on a leap year on Febuary 29th a women can propose. So all set out to get her man one obstacle after another arises. It just seems like fate has different plans. Upon arriving in a small town Anna meets Declan the locale bar keep/taxi service. He agrees to drive her to Dublin but things just keep going wrong from wrecking the car to missing their train. Dublin + Jeremy seem to be harder to get to then first thought while Declan is right in front of her. Getting caught in the rain, crashing a wedding and having to play married couple to get a room at the inn make for cute romcom moments, all w/ the beautiful irish courtyside as the backdrop. Yes they are expected and predictable but they are sweet none the less. On arrival in Dublin Jeremy ""moved"" by Anna's actions proposes to her. Cut to an empty space in the room where Declan used to be standing. Jump to Anna + Jeremy's engagment party where you learn the only reason Jeremy proposed was beacuse the landlords would only rent to a married couple. This just justifies the doubts you can tell Anna was having. Anna returns to Declan + proposes that they not make plans + just see where things lead. Declan turns and walks away w/o a word. Thinking she's been rejecting Anna heads out to overlook the ocean where Declan mets her + proposes w/ his mothers ring.(How sweet!) Of course she says yes who wouldn't he's gorgeous and that accent (oh that accent)and after she flew 3000 miles to see him. Although you totally knew from the beginning that they'd end up together watching the journey was still worth it.

True all the trappings of the traditional story are present but Leap Year managed to present these ideas in a fresh way.Anna Brady (Amy Adams) is tired of waiting for her doctor boyfriend of four years to propose to her so she takes matters into her own hands by following him to Ireland to propose to him on Leap Day. When bad weather forces her to find other means to get across Ireland to Dublin to meet him the fun begins. Stranded in a remote village she enlists the help of Declan (Matthew Goode) to drive her to the city. Along the way the two develop a very good chemistry and love begins to bloom.A big character in this film is Ireland itself and the photography by Newton Thomas Sigel shows off the country in all its craggy green beauty. Perhaps the best thing about the film is that it doesn't beat its viewer over the head with convention. The film is surprisingly well written and intelligent even as it sometimes verges into basic silliness. A slight issue the lack of any substantial extr features on the Blu Ray disc. All that is presented are a series of deleted scenes that basically flesh out the relationship of Anna with her father played by John Lithgow whose part was shortened for what could only have been time restraints.All in all this is a very well made date night movie.

To say that it's bad would be untrue, but dang it, I've seen this movie a thousand times. It would not be enough to call it formulaic; these days, it seems romantic comedies are mass produced from a cookie cutter, and unfortunately, the blade shows no signs of getting dull. Maybe I need to be institutionalized. After all, the definition of insanity is doing something repeatedly and expecting a different outcome. Incidentally, I was reminded of this a year ago, when a reader so kindly informed me that my opinion of the Ren&eacute;e Zellweger comedy ""New in Town"" wasn't valid. I guess we're at a point now where audiences no longer mind knowing how everything will turn out before entering the theater. That may be why the ads for this movie exhausted 90% of the plot.And what of the plot? Anna, a real estate stager from Boston (Amy Adams), has spent four years with her heart-surgeon boyfriend, Jeremy (Adam Scott), who still hasn't proposed to her. When he's unexpectedly sent to Dublin for a cardiologist's convention, Anna decides to follow him. You see, an Irish legend gives license for a woman to propose to a man on February 29, and lo and behold, this is a leap year and Jeremy just happens to be in Ireland in late February (the next leap year is actually 2012, but never mind). His flaws are made abundantly clear as soon as he's introduced: Although he's pleasant, he's not especially sensitive, and his appearance is so pristine that it's obvious he puts his needs above anyone else's. So what exactly does Anna see in him? I guess she missed out on the ""He's Just Not That into You"" craze.When her plane is forced to land in Wales because of inclement weather, Anna begins a hellish journey across rough waters to an Irish village on the Dingle Peninsula. Once there, she comes across a rundown pub/inn run by Declan (Matthew Goode), a surly and cynical young man who hasn't fared too well in the relationship department. He's in need of cash to pay his rent, which Anna will give him if he agrees to drive her to Dublin. He begrudgingly accepts the offer. Thus begins an all new series of hellish journeys for Anna, most of which involve comedy routines that come dangerously close to the slapstick antics of Lucille Ball. Poor Anna - she just can't seem to catch a train or a taxi on time, nor does she seem capable of adapting to Irish culture. For Declan, it's a matter of having to put up with a superficial American woman who actually believes in falling in love.Now, I could describe more, but honestly, do I really need to? Can you not see where this is going? Even if you can't, surely you've seen the ads, and have they not already spelled everything out for you? Were it not for the casting of Adams and Goode, there would be very, very little about ""Leap Year"" you wouldn't be able to get from any other romantic comedy. They're both indeed great actors; Adams, beautiful in that cute and wholesome way, is still very much a likeable presence onscreen, and Goode, having appeared in films as diverse as ""Watchmen,"" ""Brideshead Revisited,"" and ""A Single Man,"" proves he's capable of great range. And yes, they have chemistry, even at the early point in their relationship when they can't stand each other.Watching them, one can't help but wonder why such talent wasn't put to better use. Romantic comedies are a dime a dozen - anyone can star in them and have more or less the same effect on the audience. More or less. Maybe we should regard Hollywood romances the same way we regard teen slasher films, which generally have been vehicles for unknowns trying to break into the business. Adams and Goode are at a point now where they no longer need to appear in a story this contrived, implausible, and predictable.All the same, I'm not against romantic comedies. Remember, I gave passing grades to ""Music and Lyrics,"" ""No Reservations,"" ""P.S. I Love You,"" ""What Happens in Vegas,"" and ""Definitely, Maybe,"" and I greatly enjoyed last summer's ""The Ugly Truth."" Yes, they were all conventional, but I appreciated both the character development and the stylish approach given to their respective stories. But ""Leap Year,"" harmless though it may be, has absolutely no ambition to be anything more than what it obviously is. The story is completely foreseeable. The characters are flatly constructed. The humor is unappealingly broad. If general audiences can accept this, why can't I? Did I actually go into this expecting something different? I'm ready for my straightjacket now.",3,Love Knows No Originality,1263600000,"01 16, 2010",2010,4623,"['February', '29', 'once', 'four', 'years', 'How', 'wish', 'movies', 'Leap', 'Year', 'were', 'released', 'same', 'frequency', 'say', 'bad', 'would', 'be', 'untrue', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'thousand', 'times', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'call', 'formulaic', 'days', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'mass', 'produced', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'unfortunately', 'blade', 'signs', 'getting', 'dull', 'Maybe', 'need', 'be', 'institutionalized', 'definition', 'insanity', 'doing', 'something', 'repeatedly', 'expecting', 'different', 'outcome', 'Incidentally', 'was', 'reminded', 'year', 'ago', 'when', 'reader', 'so', 'kindly', 'informed', 'opinion', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Zellweger', 'comedy', 'New', 'Town', 'was', ""n't"", 'valid', 'guess', ""'re"", 'point', 'now', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'mind', 'knowing', 'how', 'everything', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'entering', 'theater', 'may', 'be', 'why', 'ads', 'movie', 'exhausted', '90', '%', 'plot.And', 'what', 'plot', 'Anna', 'real', 'estate', 'stager', 'Boston', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'spent', 'four', 'years', 'heart-surgeon', 'boyfriend', 'Jeremy', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'who', 'still', ""n't"", 'proposed', 'When', 'unexpectedly', 'sent', 'Dublin', 'cardiologist', 'convention', 'Anna', 'follow', 'see', 'Irish', 'legend', 'license', 'woman', 'propose', 'man', 'February', '29', 'lo', 'behold', 'leap', 'year', 'Jeremy', 'just', 'be', 'Ireland', 'late', 'February', 'next', 'leap', 'year', 'actually', '2012', 'never', 'mind', 'flaws', 'are', 'made', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'as', 'soon', 'introduced', 'pleasant', 'not', 'especially', 'sensitive', 'appearance', 'so', 'pristine', 'obvious', 'needs', 'anyone', 'else', 'what', 'exactly', 'Anna', 'see', 'guess', 'missed', 'out', 'Just', 'Not', 'craze.When', 'plane', 'forced', 'land', 'Wales', 'inclement', 'weather', 'Anna', 'hellish', 'journey', 'rough', 'waters', 'Irish', 'village', 'Dingle', 'Peninsula', 'Once', 'there', 'rundown', 'pub/inn', 'run', 'Declan', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'surly', 'cynical', 'young', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'fared', 'too', 'well', 'relationship', 'department', 'need', 'cash', 'pay', 'rent', 'Anna', 'will', 'give', 'drive', 'Dublin', 'begrudgingly', 'offer', 'Thus', 'new', 'series', 'hellish', 'journeys', 'Anna', 'most', 'involve', 'comedy', 'routines', 'come', 'dangerously', 'close', 'slapstick', 'antics', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Poor', 'Anna', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'train', 'taxi', 'time', 'seem', 'capable', 'adapting', 'Irish', 'culture', 'Declan', 'matter', 'having', 'put', 'up', 'superficial', 'American', 'woman', 'who', 'actually', 'falling', 'love.Now', 'could', 'describe', 'more', 'honestly', 'do', 'really', 'need', 'Can', 'not', 'see', 'where', 'going', 'Even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'surely', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ads', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'spelled', 'everything', 'out', 'Were', 'not', 'casting', 'Adams', 'Goode', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'little', 'Leap', 'Year', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'get', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'indeed', 'great', 'actors', 'Adams', 'beautiful', 'cute', 'wholesome', 'way', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'likeable', 'presence', 'onscreen', 'Goode', 'having', 'appeared', 'films', 'as', 'diverse', 'Watchmen', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'Single', 'Man', 'capable', 'great', 'range', 'yes', 'have', 'chemistry', 'even', 'early', 'point', 'relationship', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'other.Watching', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'such', 'talent', 'was', ""n't"", 'put', 'better', 'use', 'Romantic', 'comedies', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'anyone', 'can', 'star', 'have', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'effect', 'audience', 'More', 'less', 'Maybe', 'should', 'regard', 'Hollywood', 'romances', 'same', 'way', 'regard', 'teen', 'slasher', 'films', 'generally', 'have', 'been', 'vehicles', 'unknowns', 'trying', 'break', 'business', 'Adams', 'Goode', 'are', 'point', 'now', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'need', 'appear', 'story', 'contrived', 'implausible', 'predictable.All', 'same', ""'m"", 'not', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Remember', 'gave', 'passing', 'grades', 'Music', 'Lyrics', 'No', 'Reservations', 'P.S', 'Love', 'What', 'Vegas', 'Definitely', 'Maybe', 'greatly', 'enjoyed', 'last', 'summer', 'Ugly', 'Truth', 'Yes', 'were', 'conventional', 'appreciated', 'character', 'development', 'stylish', 'approach', 'given', 'respective', 'stories', 'Leap', 'Year', 'harmless', 'may', 'be', 'absolutely', 'ambition', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'what', 'obviously', 'story', 'completely', 'foreseeable', 'characters', 'are', 'flatly', 'constructed', 'humor', 'unappealingly', 'broad', 'general', 'audiences', 'can', 'accept', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Did', 'actually', 'go', 'expecting', 'something', 'different', ""'m"", 'ready', 'straightjacket', 'now']",N/A

Having recently seen it on video, I was shocked at how amazing it was and wished I had gotten the opportunity to catch it in theaters.The sensational Amy Adams stars as Ann; a woman so many women can relate to: she's dating a guy who may never commit. Her boyfriend of quite some time, Jeremy (Adam Scott) is far too consumed with bettering his career to even stop and consider marriage - let alone actually pop the question.When Jeremy rushes off to Ireland for a career opportunity, Ana is left alone wishing there was something she could do. Upon hearing about an Irish tradition, she realizes there is something she can do. She can fly to Ireland and propose to Jeremy herself, as each leap year allots for this to be customary there.If you are at all like me, you are already skeptical by the premise and if you've seen the trailer, it only adds to such skepticism. However, film works magic with its weak supposition and the trailer fails to provide it with any solitude.Ana had no idea just how difficult it would be to track Jeremy down. Between being caught in nasty storms, missing trains and being barricaded by a heard of wild animals, it seems she may never reach her love. All is not lost though, as she is accompanied on these miss-adventures by her unbeknownst to her true, true love, Declan, played by Matthew Goode.The two can't stand each other for the majority of the film, but we can see their underlying chemistry behind all their bickering. Soon enough, having shared a few moments, and after they let their guard down to one another, they will see it too.Leap Year was written by the team who crafted such hits as Made of Honor and Can't Hardly Wait. And it has some of the best cinematography of the year, displaying magnificent shots of the Irish countryside that will have you booking a flight there during the movie.This is the kind of film that evokes thoughts of fate and as a huge advocate for fate, I find this refreshing in films. If you've ever been touched by destiny in your life, then you know exactly what I am talking about. Sometimes we kick and scream at the sight of the path we find ourselves on, only to realize later, and sometimes much, much later, that it is in fact the path we prefer.",4,Leap Year Review,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,2671,"['LEAP', 'YEARSTARRING', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Noel', ""O'DonovanWRITTEN"", 'BY', 'Deborah', 'Kaplan', 'Harry', 'ElfontDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Anand', 'TuckerRated', 'PGGenre', 'Romantic', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '08', 'January', '2010Review', 'Date', '26', 'May', '2010When', 'Leap', 'Year', 'slid', 'theaters', 'doing', 'so', 'horribly', 'box', 'office', 'being', 'plagued', 'rumors', 'was', 'horrible', 'was', ""n't"", 'let', 'missed', 'big', 'screen', 'Having', 'recently', 'seen', 'video', 'was', 'shocked', 'how', 'amazing', 'was', 'wished', 'had', 'gotten', 'opportunity', 'catch', 'theaters.The', 'sensational', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Ann', 'woman', 'so', 'many', 'women', 'can', 'relate', 'dating', 'guy', 'who', 'may', 'never', 'commit', 'boyfriend', 'quite', 'time', 'Jeremy', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'far', 'too', 'consumed', 'bettering', 'career', 'even', 'stop', 'consider', 'marriage', 'let', 'alone', 'actually', 'pop', 'question.When', 'Jeremy', 'Ireland', 'career', 'opportunity', 'Ana', 'left', 'alone', 'wishing', 'was', 'something', 'could', 'do', 'hearing', 'Irish', 'tradition', 'something', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'fly', 'Ireland', 'propose', 'Jeremy', 'leap', 'year', 'allots', 'be', 'customary', 'there.If', 'are', 'are', 'already', 'skeptical', 'premise', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailer', 'only', 'such', 'skepticism', 'However', 'film', 'works', 'magic', 'weak', 'supposition', 'trailer', 'provide', 'solitude.Ana', 'had', 'idea', 'just', 'how', 'difficult', 'would', 'be', 'track', 'Jeremy', 'down', 'Between', 'being', 'caught', 'nasty', 'storms', 'missing', 'trains', 'being', 'barricaded', 'heard', 'wild', 'animals', 'may', 'never', 'reach', 'love', 'not', 'lost', 'though', 'accompanied', 'miss-adventures', 'unbeknownst', 'true', 'true', 'love', 'Declan', 'played', 'Matthew', 'Goode.The', 'two', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'other', 'majority', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'underlying', 'chemistry', 'bickering', 'Soon', 'enough', 'having', 'shared', 'few', 'moments', 'let', 'guard', 'one', 'will', 'see', 'too.Leap', 'Year', 'was', 'written', 'team', 'who', 'crafted', 'such', 'hits', 'Made', 'Honor', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'best', 'cinematography', 'year', 'displaying', 'magnificent', 'shots', 'Irish', 'countryside', 'will', 'have', 'booking', 'flight', 'there', 'movie.This', 'kind', 'film', 'thoughts', 'fate', 'huge', 'advocate', 'fate', 'find', 'refreshing', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'been', 'touched', 'destiny', 'life', 'then', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'Sometimes', 'kick', 'scream', 'sight', 'path', 'find', 'only', 'realize', 'later', 'sometimes', 'much', 'much', 'later', 'fact', 'path', 'prefer']",N/A

This is one cute little romance, and Amy Adams is so darn cute she should be a lollipop, and all this. . .cuteness. . .leads to the quaint charm of a tale of woe and love, set in the emerald green hills of a lush Irish countryside.  Rom-coms aren't my cup of joe, but LEAP YEAR was so charming I got past that.What's exceptional here is the stellar fact the two budding lovebirds are completely and actually likable:  Adams as Anna, a control freak A Type who follows her dud boyfriend to Ireland to propose marriage on Leap Year Day; Matthew Goode as Declan, a spontaneous, rather brooding silent type, who agrees to help Anna get to Dublin to make said proposal.  The only truly annoying character is the stuffy boyfriend (Adam Scott), and he's supposed to be annoying.  As Anna and Declan (such a cool name!) traipse the green countryside they experience one misadventure after another, yet their initial animosity morphs into mutual respect, which morphs into a soul-connecting attraction.  And as they embark on their journey we the viewers are exposed to an exquisite taste of grand Irish culture that is quite the treat.Go fetch us another bottle of wine, me lassie!Granted, the plot is totally predictable (please name me a rom-com flick that isn't?), and we get the customary kittens and butterflies ending, but come on.

1332708,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B0038N9X3G,Elisabeth,"[5, 8]","According to an Irish tradition, on leap year, a woman is allowed to propose marriage if she hasn't been proposed to yet.  Since her boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott) of 4 years hasn't made a move yet, Anna (Amy Adams) flies to Dublin, Ireland to propose herself.  However, due to airplane complications, Anna is instead forced to stay in Wales and share company with a rude cab driver named Declan (Matthew Goode).What follows is a predictable storyline we've all seen before: two opposites meet who at first hate each other and then fall in love.  I'm not giving anything away since that's also revealed on the trailer.How this romance comes to be felt very contrived. First, they pretend to be a couple (which didn't seem necessary), then they're forced to share the same room, then forced to share the same bed, and then also forced to share a kiss...all of which is supposed to create a spark that's surprises the couple...but didn't surprise me.Meanwhile, we're just supposed to forget that Anna still has a boyfriend who's being cheated on and just focus on Anna and Declan getting together.But I can't do that.  For one, I can't root for people getting together at the expense of someone else.  And second, even if no infidelity were involved, these two are unlikable characters.Anna is portrayed as a snob (and she is), but Declan is a snob, too. He equates the word ""American"" with ""arrogant"" and so, right from the start, judges her without bothering to get to know her. He looks down on her, calling her names and making her the butt of his jokes.He's also so arrogant that he'd rather make a point (which puts her belongings at risk) than try to save her...though later in a bar scene, he does step up, but I had already disliked him so much by this point.To help us support Anna's cheating, Anna's boyfriend Jeremy is portrayed as a shallow person. However, Anna is shallow, too. When asked why she wants to marry Jeremy, all she can say is he's a cardiologist.The humor is this movie is corny and the pacing is so slow, I almost fell asleep a few times.There were 2 scenes I really liked though:1 -- the dinner sceneIn this scene, a long-term married couple shares their secret to a happy marriage. Their secret is to always kiss each other as if it were the first kiss and the very last one.2 -- the wedding scene with the anonymous coupleIn this scene, the bride gives a speech to her newly wedded husband and tells him she hopes he never steals, lies, or cheats. But then she adds that if he ever does steal, she hopes he steals away her sorrows...if he ever does lie, she hopes he lies by her side for the rest of her days...and if he ever does cheat, she hopes he cheats death because she couldn't spend a day living without him.These scenes are corny for sure, but I still liked them...not just because they're romantic messages, but because they're romantic messages supporting long-term monogamy (which I'm a supporter of).However touching these two scenes were, though, they couldn't save this movie.  Nothing in this movie surprised me...except for the corny ending.  I didn't think an already corny movie could push the envelope of corniness...but it did.",2,Nothing in this movie surprised me...except for corny ending,1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,3177,"['According', 'Irish', 'tradition', 'leap', 'year', 'woman', 'allowed', 'propose', 'marriage', ""n't"", 'been', 'proposed', 'yet', 'boyfriend', 'Jeremy', 'Adam', 'Scott', '4', 'years', ""n't"", 'made', 'move', 'yet', 'Anna', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Dublin', 'Ireland', 'propose', 'However', 'due', 'airplane', 'complications', 'Anna', 'instead', 'forced', 'stay', 'Wales', 'share', 'company', 'rude', 'cab', 'driver', 'named', 'Declan', 'Matthew', 'Goode', '.What', 'predictable', 'storyline', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'two', 'opposites', 'meet', 'who', 'first', 'hate', 'other', 'then', 'fall', 'love', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'also', 'revealed', 'trailer.How', 'romance', 'be', 'felt', 'very', 'contrived', 'First', 'pretend', 'be', 'couple', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'necessary', 'then', ""'re"", 'forced', 'share', 'same', 'room', 'then', 'forced', 'share', 'same', 'bed', 'then', 'also', 'forced', 'share', 'kiss', 'supposed', 'create', 'spark', 'couple', 'did', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'me.Meanwhile', ""'re"", 'just', 'supposed', 'forget', 'Anna', 'still', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'being', 'cheated', 'just', 'focus', 'Anna', 'Declan', 'getting', 'together.But', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'root', 'people', 'getting', 'together', 'expense', 'someone', 'else', 'second', 'even', 'infidelity', 'were', 'involved', 'two', 'are', 'unlikable', 'characters.Anna', 'portrayed', 'snob', 'Declan', 'snob', 'too', 'word', 'American', 'arrogant', 'so', 'right', 'start', 'judges', 'bothering', 'get', 'know', 'down', 'calling', 'names', 'making', 'butt', 'jokes.He', 'also', 'so', 'arrogant', ""'d"", 'rather', 'make', 'point', 'belongings', 'risk', 'try', 'save', 'later', 'bar', 'scene', 'step', 'up', 'had', 'already', 'disliked', 'so', 'much', 'point.To', 'help', 'support', 'Anna', 'cheating', 'Anna', 'boyfriend', 'Jeremy', 'portrayed', 'shallow', 'person', 'However', 'Anna', 'shallow', 'too', 'When', 'asked', 'why', 'marry', 'Jeremy', 'can', 'say', 'cardiologist.The', 'humor', 'movie', 'corny', 'pacing', 'so', 'slow', 'almost', 'fell', 'asleep', 'few', 'were', '2', 'scenes', 'really', 'liked', 'though:1', 'dinner', 'sceneIn', 'scene', 'long-term', 'married', 'couple', 'shares', 'secret', 'happy', 'marriage', 'secret', 'always', 'kiss', 'other', 'were', 'first', 'kiss', 'very', 'last', 'one.2', 'wedding', 'scene', 'anonymous', 'coupleIn', 'scene', 'bride', 'speech', 'newly', 'wedded', 'husband', 'never', 'steals', 'cheats', 'then', 'ever', 'steal', 'away', 'sorrows', 'ever', 'lie', 'side', 'rest', 'days', 'ever', 'cheat', 'death', 'could', ""n't"", 'spend', 'day', 'living', 'him.These', 'scenes', 'are', 'corny', 'sure', 'still', 'liked', 'not', 'just', ""'re"", 'romantic', 'messages', ""'re"", 'romantic', 'messages', 'supporting', 'long-term', 'monogamy', ""'m"", 'supporter', '.However', 'touching', 'two', 'scenes', 'were', 'though', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'movie', 'Nothing', 'movie', 'surprised', 'corny', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'already', 'corny', 'movie', 'could', 'push', 'envelope', 'corniness', 'did']",N/A

Most people would skip movies like that because they think it is too predictable or &#34;lame&#34;, but I love them because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been &#34;slimed&#34;.  Leap Year, I have to admit, wasn't the cleanest, but it was not the worst either.There are no sex scenes; however, a man watches a woman showering, and her nude silhouette is shown through the shower curtain; a man is seen once with only a towel wrapped around his waist, and a woman is seen in a towel; the scene is short and neither is very revealing; a woman is briefly seen in her underwear; there are a few kissing scenes, including an old Italian couple french kissing; at an inn, the innkeeper winks at a man as in a way of congratulating him for sleeping with his 'wife'. The man and woman implied here never actually do anything, but did sleep in the same bed.The only violence is one short, mild fight scene where a man punches out three other men after it is implied that they are threatening a woman, but there is not blood; a man breaks a chicken's neck (for cooking). It is not shown, but we see the motions of his arms doing so and hear the cracking of the bones.There is general swearing throughout the movie and as for drinking, the main male character runs a pub so there are some scenes of people drinking beer. A party scene where people are drinking wine, champagne, etc....Anna travels to Dublin, Ireland to propose to her boyfriend Jeremy on February 29, leap day (according to Irish tradition, a man who receives a marriage proposal on a leap day must accept it).  She thought he was going to propose before he left, because he said he had a &#34;very special&#34; surprise for her and her friend saw hm coming out a a jewelry store; however, it turns out he just bought her earnings.  On her way there, because of the weather, she ends up in a tiny Irish town, where she hires Declan, the local pub/hotel owner and cab driver to take her to Ireland.  He only agrees because he needs the money so he doesn't loose his pub.  Almost right after they leave they end up walking because first, his car ends up in the river; her luggage gets stolen; they get kicked out another pub after a fight to get her luggage back; she misses the train because they don't get back down the mountain in time after walking up to see a castle; on the way down the mountain she slips and falls in the mud; they have to pretend to be married in order to get a room in the only B&B; in town; waiting for a local preacher to drive them, she dances at a local wedding and one of her shoes flies off and hits the bride in the head and then she knocks wine onto the brides dress; distressed over what happened, she then gets drunk and throws up all over Declan's shoes.  He ends up carrying her (I guess) to town and they take a bus to Ireland.  Through all of this they somehow managed to fall in love; however, when they get to the hotel where Jeremy is staying, Jeremy proposes himself and Declan walks out.  When she finds out later the reason why Jeremy proposed, Anna rethinks what she thought she wanted for her future.Overall, I liked the movie and will watch it again (with a ClearPlay filter).",4,"Leap Year - would watch again, but with ClearPlay",1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,3289,"['like', 'good', 'clean', 'movies', 'as', 'clean', 'can', 'get', 'nowadays', 'Most', 'people', 'would', 'skip', 'movies', 'think', 'too', 'predictable', '34', 'lame', '34', 'love', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'watching', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'just', 'been', '34', 'slimed', '34', 'Leap', 'Year', 'have', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'cleanest', 'was', 'not', 'worst', 'are', 'sex', 'scenes', 'however', 'man', 'woman', 'showering', 'nude', 'silhouette', 'shown', 'shower', 'curtain', 'man', 'seen', 'once', 'only', 'towel', 'wrapped', 'waist', 'woman', 'seen', 'towel', 'scene', 'short', 'very', 'revealing', 'woman', 'briefly', 'seen', 'underwear', 'are', 'few', 'kissing', 'scenes', 'including', 'old', 'Italian', 'couple', 'french', 'kissing', 'inn', 'innkeeper', 'winks', 'man', 'way', 'congratulating', 'sleeping', ""'wife"", 'man', 'woman', 'implied', 'here', 'never', 'actually', 'do', 'anything', 'did', 'sleep', 'same', 'bed.The', 'only', 'violence', 'one', 'short', 'mild', 'fight', 'scene', 'where', 'man', 'out', 'three', 'other', 'men', 'implied', 'are', 'threatening', 'woman', 'not', 'blood', 'man', 'chicken', 'neck', 'cooking', 'not', 'shown', 'see', 'motions', 'arms', 'doing', 'so', 'hear', 'cracking', 'bones.There', 'general', 'swearing', 'movie', 'drinking', 'main', 'male', 'character', 'pub', 'are', 'scenes', 'people', 'drinking', 'beer', 'A', 'party', 'scene', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'drinking', 'wine', 'champagne', 'etc', '.Anna', 'travels', 'Dublin', 'Ireland', 'propose', 'boyfriend', 'Jeremy', 'February', '29', 'leap', 'day', 'according', 'Irish', 'tradition', 'man', 'who', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'leap', 'day', 'must', 'accept', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'propose', 'left', 'said', 'had', '34', 'very', 'special', '34', 'surprise', 'friend', 'saw', 'hm', 'coming', 'out', 'jewelry', 'store', 'however', 'out', 'just', 'bought', 'earnings', 'way', 'there', 'weather', 'up', 'tiny', 'Irish', 'town', 'where', 'Declan', 'local', 'pub/hotel', 'owner', 'cab', 'driver', 'take', 'Ireland', 'only', 'money', ""n't"", 'loose', 'pub', 'Almost', 'right', 'leave', 'end', 'up', 'walking', 'first', 'car', 'up', 'river', 'luggage', 'stolen', 'get', 'kicked', 'out', 'pub', 'fight', 'get', 'luggage', 'back', 'train', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'back', 'down', 'mountain', 'time', 'walking', 'up', 'see', 'castle', 'way', 'mountain', 'mud', 'have', 'pretend', 'be', 'married', 'order', 'get', 'room', 'only', 'B', 'B', 'town', 'waiting', 'local', 'preacher', 'drive', 'local', 'wedding', 'one', 'shoes', 'flies', 'bride', 'head', 'then', 'wine', 'brides', 'dress', 'distressed', 'what', 'happened', 'then', 'drunk', 'up', 'Declan', 'shoes', 'up', 'carrying', 'guess', 'town', 'take', 'bus', 'Ireland', 'somehow', 'managed', 'fall', 'love', 'however', 'when', 'get', 'hotel', 'where', 'Jeremy', 'staying', 'Jeremy', 'Declan', 'out', 'When', 'out', 'later', 'reason', 'why', 'Jeremy', 'proposed', 'Anna', 'what', 'thought', 'wanted', 'future.Overall', 'liked', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'ClearPlay', 'filter']",N/A

Not too much luck so far but one keeps hoping.""Leap Year"" directed by Anand Tucker uses the same exact recipe for romantic comedy as thousands flicks did before it.  A successful professional young woman Anna (Amy Adams) has a proper and perfect boyfriend, Jeremy (Adam Scott),  the cardiologist with whom she is buying the posh apartment in the best Boston area, waits for the proposal with the ring, decides to use Irish Leap Year tradition to propose him instead and finds herself in some Irish country side instead of Dublin where her boyfriend-cardiologist is attending the conference. She employs the services of the young local inn-keeper named Declan (Matthew Goode) to get to Dublin even though she did not like the guy at all thinking of him rude bumpkin redneck - Irish style. He in turn sees her as a typical arrogant airhead American who calls her suitcase by the name (Louis Vuitton that is). He also finds her romantic idea of proposal to her boyfriend on February 29 of the leap year the most stupid thing ever. But she is willing to pay and he desperately needs money to upgrade the inn. So off the go - she in her $600 5 inches hills. Considering that she would have to do a lot of walking since the ""classic"" red little car that Declan offered as the means of transpiration was not very reliable to say the least, you might ask why Anna did not pack a pair of sneakers or comfortable walking shoes in her precious Louis Vuitton luggage? But I assume that walking, limping, stumbling in the high heels and felling on the country muddy roads during never-ending rain is one of the ingredients for the perfect romantic comedy recipe.Number one rule  in the rom com which sometimes works fine (It did indeed in It Happened One Night) - if the girl and the boy hate each other in the beginning of the film and they are sent to a journey together, they may end up well not hating each other that much in the end. The film creators did not break any of the rules and it is up to us to believe in Ever after.As predictable as it sounds, ""Leap Year"" is actually a pleasant little movie perhaps because two main characters are funny and likable as played by Amy Adams and Matthew Goode. I liked Goode especially. If I had to choose between him and Anna's materialistic boyfriend Jeremy, there would be no doubt in my mind from the beginning. Declan got charisma and sense of humor that make him irresistible. And he is cute, too. As an Irish travelogue, the movie is not bad at all and pleases the eye with some nice scenery. It is predictable in a cozy, uneventful way but you could have spent 100 minutes much worse - to watch Lars von Trier's ""Antichrist"", for example.",3,Just get her to Dublin in time.,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,2998,"['guess', 'deep', 'am', 'fan', 'romcoms', 'hoping', 'high', 'art', 'making', 'good', 'funny', 'memorable', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'would', 'reborn', 'one', 'day', 'one', 'plentiful', 'attempts', 'why', 'keep', 'watching', 'new', 'movies', 'genre', 'TV', 'commercials', 'announce', 'best', 'funniest', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'ever', 'saw', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'luck', 'so', 'far', 'one', 'hoping', 'Leap', 'Year', 'directed', 'Anand', 'Tucker', 'same', 'exact', 'recipe', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'thousands', 'flicks', 'did', 'successful', 'professional', 'young', 'woman', 'Anna', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'proper', 'perfect', 'boyfriend', 'Jeremy', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'cardiologist', 'whom', 'buying', 'posh', 'apartment', 'best', 'Boston', 'area', 'waits', 'proposal', 'ring', 'use', 'Irish', 'Leap', 'Year', 'tradition', 'propose', 'instead', 'Irish', 'country', 'side', 'instead', 'Dublin', 'where', 'boyfriend-cardiologist', 'attending', 'conference', 'services', 'young', 'local', 'inn-keeper', 'named', 'Declan', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'get', 'Dublin', 'even', 'did', 'not', 'guy', 'thinking', 'rude', 'bumpkin', 'redneck', 'Irish', 'style', 'turn', 'typical', 'arrogant', 'airhead', 'American', 'who', 'suitcase', 'name', 'Louis', 'Vuitton', 'also', 'romantic', 'idea', 'proposal', 'boyfriend', 'February', '29', 'leap', 'year', 'most', 'stupid', 'thing', 'ever', 'willing', 'pay', 'desperately', 'money', 'upgrade', 'inn', 'go', '600', '5', 'inches', 'hills', 'Considering', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'lot', 'walking', 'classic', 'red', 'little', 'car', 'Declan', 'offered', 'means', 'transpiration', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'reliable', 'say', 'least', 'might', 'ask', 'why', 'Anna', 'did', 'not', 'pack', 'pair', 'sneakers', 'comfortable', 'walking', 'shoes', 'precious', 'Louis', 'Vuitton', 'luggage', 'assume', 'walking', 'limping', 'stumbling', 'high', 'heels', 'felling', 'country', 'muddy', 'roads', 'never-ending', 'rain', 'one', 'ingredients', 'perfect', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'recipe.Number', 'one', 'rule', 'rom', 'com', 'sometimes', 'fine', 'did', 'indeed', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'girl', 'boy', 'hate', 'other', 'beginning', 'film', 'are', 'sent', 'journey', 'together', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'well', 'not', 'hating', 'other', 'much', 'end', 'film', 'creators', 'did', 'not', 'break', 'rules', 'believe', 'Ever', 'after.As', 'predictable', 'Leap', 'Year', 'actually', 'pleasant', 'little', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'funny', 'likable', 'played', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'liked', 'Goode', 'especially', 'had', 'choose', 'Anna', 'materialistic', 'boyfriend', 'Jeremy', 'would', 'be', 'doubt', 'mind', 'beginning', 'Declan', 'got', 'charisma', 'sense', 'humor', 'make', 'irresistible', 'cute', 'too', 'Irish', 'travelogue', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'eye', 'nice', 'scenery', 'predictable', 'cozy', 'uneventful', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'spent', '100', 'minutes', 'much', 'worse', 'watch', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'Antichrist', 'example']",N/A

When he doesn't and travels to Dublin, Ireland, she recalls her father (actor John Lithgow -- more about him later) and his story how Ireland had a tradition of every four years, on leap day, it's tradition and okay for a woman to propose to a man. Thus, she sets out to Dublin to do this...and when things go wrong, will she make it in time?SPOILERS: In the end, the boyfriend suddenly proposes to her before she even had a chance. However, it turns out that was just out-of-the-blue and he didn't really want to. In order to get the apartment they wanted, the place wanted married people. So, it was just for something material and he didn't really value her. ""We would have gotten around to it eventually,"" he mentions. That was enough to get her to realize that she shouldn't get married to him.I couldn't appreciate the idea that she would then agree to marry the man, Declan, who helped her get to Dublin, after knowing him for literally a couple days. He's a stranger, for crying out loud. It's not romantic and how could it even be a smart idea to marry immediately? Along the same line (though it's not suggested in the movie) it isn't bright to have sex right away with someone you barely know under the mistaken idea that it's the same as love.The woman had it right at first, when she asked Declan if he would like to ""not make plans"" with her. She's always had things on a timetable and she wanted to relax and see where it goes. Her speech to Declan and that she travelled 3,000 miles back to see him, was romantic. The guy eventually proposes to her, saying he WANTS to make plans with her, and she agrees. They eventually drive off after the wedding ceremony that we don't see.**END SPOILERS**It's a shame they didn't get more use out of John Lithgow, who portrayed the father of Anna (the lead actress). He's only in there for a couple of minutes of the beginning and a portion of his participation is on the deleted scenes. It should have been kept in; I wanted to see him in more than just a cameo.One mistake I surely noticed was, in the scene where the car rolls down the hill and into the water, the lady's leaving to walk to Dublin. However, she's going the wrong direction away from the hill. Oops.Sure, this isn't the most original of movies and some of the ideas are recycled from other flicks, but it's something I enjoyed. I've never seen or heard of the two lead actors before and I enjoyed it. I'm half-Irish and I suppose that enbabled me to like this more. I had a few laughs, there's great music, and the fantastic scenery improve this nice n' lighthearted flick that's worth checking out.",3,it was certainly okay,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,2710,"['flick', 'have', 'woman', 'expecting', 'boyfriend', 'four', 'years', 'propose', 'When', ""n't"", 'travels', 'Dublin', 'Ireland', 'father', 'actor', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'more', 'later', 'story', 'how', 'Ireland', 'had', 'tradition', 'four', 'years', 'leap', 'day', 'tradition', 'okay', 'woman', 'propose', 'man', 'Thus', 'out', 'Dublin', 'do', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'will', 'make', 'time', 'SPOILERS', 'end', 'boyfriend', 'suddenly', 'even', 'had', 'chance', 'However', 'out', 'was', 'just', 'out-of-the-blue', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'order', 'get', 'apartment', 'wanted', 'place', 'wanted', 'married', 'people', 'So', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'material', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'value', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'eventually', 'was', 'enough', 'get', 'realize', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'married', 'him.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'idea', 'would', 'then', 'agree', 'marry', 'man', 'Declan', 'who', 'helped', 'get', 'Dublin', 'knowing', 'literally', 'couple', 'days', 'stranger', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'not', 'romantic', 'how', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'smart', 'idea', 'marry', 'immediately', 'same', 'line', 'not', 'suggested', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bright', 'have', 'sex', 'right', 'away', 'someone', 'barely', 'know', 'mistaken', 'idea', 'same', 'love.The', 'woman', 'had', 'right', 'first', 'when', 'asked', 'Declan', 'would', 'like', 'not', 'make', 'plans', 'always', 'had', 'things', 'timetable', 'wanted', 'relax', 'see', 'where', 'speech', 'Declan', 'travelled', '3,000', 'miles', 'back', 'see', 'was', 'romantic', 'guy', 'eventually', 'saying', 'make', 'plans', 'eventually', 'drive', 'off', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', '**END', 'SPOILERS**It', 'shame', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'use', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'who', 'portrayed', 'father', 'Anna', 'lead', 'actress', 'only', 'couple', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'portion', 'participation', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'just', 'cameo.One', 'mistake', 'surely', 'noticed', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'car', 'down', 'hill', 'water', 'lady', 'leaving', 'walk', 'Dublin', 'However', 'going', 'wrong', 'direction', 'away', 'hill', 'Oops.Sure', ""n't"", 'most', 'original', 'movies', 'ideas', 'are', 'recycled', 'other', 'flicks', 'something', 'enjoyed', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'heard', 'two', 'lead', 'actors', 'enjoyed', ""'m"", 'half-Irish', 'suppose', 'enbabled', 'like', 'more', 'had', 'few', 'laughs', 'great', 'music', 'fantastic', 'scenery', 'improve', 'nice', 'n', 'lighthearted', 'flick', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

In its sensibilities LEAP YEAR calls to mind the fancified, sentimental blarney of THE QUIET MAN more so than, say, the working class grit and realism of THE COMMITMENTS or ONCE. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure this bit of comedic romantic fluff was never intended as social commentary. This film is rife with tired cliches, redolent with contrived plot twists. The lead character, Anna Brady, loathes surprises. She would've loved this movie. And I know, I know, I'm bagging on this film, and I feel kind of mealy-mouthed. In the rankings of road romantic films, by no means is LEAP YEAR a classic like IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. I don't even think it's in the same class as THE SURE THING. But I like this movie.It's an old recipe, right? Take an uptight character - Amy Adams plays uber-organized Bostonian, Anna Brady - and plonk her in an unfamiliar environment and see how she does. By trade Anna is an apartment stager, meaning she pretties up a joint that's been put up for sale, making it look more enticing that it may really be. Anna plans for everything, and her need for control even shades into her romantic relationship. She's been with the same guy for four years now, a cardiologist whose smarminess makes him easy to not root for. When he goes to Ireland on business, Anna does maybe the most impetuous thing she's ever done. She follows him to Ireland to propose. On the Emerald Isle, on February 29th, folklore custom suggests it's perfectly okay for the girl to ask the guy. How very forward thinking.S#!+ happens, though. Foul weather diverts Anna's plane, and she ultimately ends up on the wrong side of Ireland, in this tiny town called Dingle, a word ideal for snickering. Looking for a ride to Dublin, she runs into Declan (Matthew Goode, quite good), this young, grouchy, scruffy innkeeper. She needs a ride. He needs to come up with some quick cash. Off they go. Even though they don't like each other. She's all snippy and brittle. He's brooding and, well, Irish. You can see it coming, right?By the way, Declan frankly considers the Leap Year tradition of proposing to be the Lord of All Poo.You see everything coming, you do. From the quirky Irish villagers and their whimsical superstitions to the obstacles which pop up to hinder Anna from reaching Dublin in timely fashion. Frankly, Anna's Louis Vuitton suitcase makes for a more interesting supporting character. But here's the thing: all the by-the-book narrative devices can be surmounted if only there's spark between the two romantic leads, and I think we have that here. Adams and Goode's charisma and chemistry push this boulder of a movie up that hill. They take an unoriginal screenplay and make their scenes seem effortless and just about organic. Or maybe I'm being tricked silly by Amy Adams, who I think is just flawless. But I see her impeccable comedic timing and her effervescence and that sense of vulnerability she projects and that red hair, and I'm sunk, bro. Amy Adams always gets to me, and the weak script can go hang.The scenic Irish countryside ain't too shabby, either. If nothing else, LEAP YEAR works as a quaint and picturesque travelogue.",4,"Hey, is this a review or a love letter to Amy Adams?

And of coarse they ""hate"" each other. Righhht. And yada, yada, yada opposites attract and they get feelings for each other.  Sound familiar?So basically this movie is predictable at least as far as the overall plot is concerned.  It's you're basic romantic comedy movie that was obviously written by a guy as most of these types of movies are.  Or if women were on the writing staff, they obviously didn't put as much into the script as the males did. Hints to this are:1. The coarse and a-holish male lead who at this point is still a stranger gets to walk in on the woman while she's in her underwear; he ignores her demands to exit the room while she's changing and she finds this behavior 'charming.'2. The female lead is of coarse proper and neat, and full of manners & always prepared because that's the way girls are... and the male lead is dirty, rough & mean because that's the way guys are.3. The male lead gets to act like an a-hole (but he has an excuse because his girlfriend left him) and allows her luggage to be stolen by people he knows to be thieves...but then after he's had his laughs with that, he decides to get into a bar fight with them to get the stuff back and she finds this ""impressive.""4. Female lead walks all over ireland including up a steep hill towards an irish castle in 4 inch heels and the tinge of pain never flashes across her face.  Even though the little miss perfect type would wear heels like that, there would be blood after walking all day in those on hard ground and then walking up a hill.  That was just too much.So what's good about this movie?  Well quite frankly the female lead.  Don't know her name, but she is superb in her role and she really makes the entire movie. Seriously.  Without her I really think this film would've been quite boring given how predictable and average the script is.  The costume design is also great.  Really brought out the characters.  The actress does wonders for this boring overdone script & she is the reason to watch this movie.",3,We've all seen this movie a hundred times before,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,2245,"['straight-laced', 'perfect', 'girl', 'more', 'commitment', 'straight-laced', 'perfect', 'man', 'Then', 'Girl', 'rough', 'mannerless', 'loner', 'coarse', 'really', 'just', 'misunderstood', 'feelings', 'coarse', 'exterior', 'coarse', 'hate', 'other', 'Righhht', 'yada', 'attract', 'get', 'feelings', 'other', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'So', 'basically', 'movie', 'predictable', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'overall', 'plot', 'concerned', ""'re"", 'basic', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'movie', 'was', 'obviously', 'written', 'guy', 'most', 'types', 'movies', 'are', 'women', 'were', 'writing', 'staff', 'obviously', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'as', 'much', 'script', 'males', 'did', 'Hints', 'are:1', 'coarse', 'a-holish', 'male', 'lead', 'who', 'point', 'still', 'stranger', 'walk', 'woman', 'underwear', 'demands', 'exit', 'room', 'changing', 'behavior', ""'charming."", '2', 'female', 'lead', 'coarse', 'proper', 'neat', 'full', 'manners', 'always', 'prepared', 'way', 'girls', 'are', 'male', 'lead', 'dirty', 'rough', 'mean', 'way', 'guys', 'are.3', 'male', 'lead', 'act', 'a-hole', 'excuse', 'girlfriend', 'left', 'luggage', 'be', 'stolen', 'people', 'be', 'thieves', 'then', 'had', 'laughs', 'get', 'bar', 'fight', 'get', 'stuff', 'back', 'impressive.', '4', 'Female', 'lead', 'walks', 'ireland', 'including', 'up', 'steep', 'hill', 'irish', 'castle', '4', 'inch', 'heels', 'tinge', 'pain', 'never', 'face', 'Even', 'little', 'miss', 'perfect', 'type', 'would', 'wear', 'heels', 'would', 'be', 'blood', 'walking', 'day', 'hard', 'ground', 'then', 'walking', 'up', 'hill', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much.So', 'what', 'good', 'movie', 'Well', 'quite', 'frankly', 'female', 'lead', 'Do', ""n't"", 'know', 'name', 'superb', 'role', 'really', 'entire', 'movie', 'Seriously', 'really', 'think', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'quite', 'boring', 'given', 'how', 'predictable', 'average', 'script', 'costume', 'design', 'also', 'great', 'Really', 'brought', 'out', 'characters', 'actress', 'wonders', 'boring', 'overdone', 'script', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie']",N/A

How can you not love the exuberant, giddy, forever smiling redhead who brings flashes of Lucille Ball while making the world fall in love.  I now seem to watch more romantic comedies than I do horror films, and with all the women in my house, that probably won't be changing for a long time.  I guess I am lucky enough to enjoy most of them and ""Leap Year"" was no exception.  Another trip down lover's lane in a typical boy meets girl, boy likes girl, girl proposes to the wrong dude but gains her senses and, well, happily ever after.Amy Adams is a jet setting young socialite who stages houses for a living.  She does things like place a couch under a window, drop cookies in the oven, etc.  All in an effort to sell the next condo to that up and coming couple.  She is meticulous, has her life all planned out and is about to marry a doctor.  Nothing against doctors but what woman really wants to marry one.  They have horrible hours, are constantly on call, miss all the important family outings and rumor has it they tend to hook up with nurses.  Ok, I just made that last part up, but it sounds logical.  Nurses are pretty darn cute in those little white outfits.So Amy gets tired of waiting for her perfect man to propose and since he is on a trip to Ireland gets the bright idea of asking the big question herself.  I guess there is some Irish tradition that allows the women to propose on the 29th of February.  Now I am all about equal opportunity, but don't most women want the man to propose.  Isn't it all about the romance and stuff.  Anyway, she follows him over to the island and, yes, you guessed it, things go all haywire and she ends up meeting Mathew Goode who embodies all that is not a doctor.He runs a local bar/restaurant, is fighting to keep it from being repossessed and hangs out most of the day serving up alcohol to the old cronies.  Mathew gives his best effort in helping Amy get back to Dublin where her perfect man awaits and along the road, you guessed it, things go haywire.  I think the moral of all these romantic comedies is, to find happiness you must first have some crazy, yes even pretty hilarious things happen.  Without the bizarre antics you are just left with everyday life, and what fun is that.I enjoyed ""Leap Year"".  It wasn't the best movie I have seen and I didn't always feel a connection between Amy and Mathew but there were several funny scenes.  Let's face facts as well.  Ireland is beautiful and Amy Adams lights up the screen with her smile and energetic fun filled personality.  If she isn't this generations Meg Ryan then I have no idea which way is up.  Ok, not a good barometer since I am on my third glass of wine, but you get the point",4,Meg Ryan meets Lucille Ball = Amy Adams.,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,2818,"['likes', 'Enchanted', 'Julie', 'Julia', 'belt', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'fast', 'becoming', 'decades', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'love', 'exuberant', 'giddy', 'forever', 'smiling', 'redhead', 'who', 'flashes', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'making', 'world', 'fall', 'love', 'now', 'seem', 'watch', 'more', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'do', 'horror', 'films', 'women', 'house', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'changing', 'long', 'time', 'guess', 'am', 'lucky', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'most', 'Leap', 'Year', 'was', 'exception', 'trip', 'down', 'lover', 'lane', 'typical', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'boy', 'likes', 'girl', 'girl', 'proposes', 'wrong', 'dude', 'gains', 'senses', 'well', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Amy', 'Adams', 'jet', 'setting', 'young', 'socialite', 'who', 'stages', 'houses', 'living', 'things', 'place', 'couch', 'window', 'drop', 'cookies', 'oven', 'etc', 'effort', 'sell', 'next', 'condo', 'up', 'coming', 'couple', 'meticulous', 'life', 'planned', 'out', 'about', 'marry', 'doctor', 'Nothing', 'doctors', 'what', 'woman', 'really', 'marry', 'one', 'have', 'horrible', 'hours', 'are', 'constantly', 'call', 'miss', 'important', 'family', 'outings', 'rumor', 'tend', 'hook', 'up', 'nurses', 'Ok', 'just', 'made', 'last', 'part', 'up', 'logical', 'Nurses', 'are', 'pretty', 'darn', 'cute', 'little', 'white', 'outfits.So', 'Amy', 'tired', 'waiting', 'perfect', 'man', 'propose', 'trip', 'Ireland', 'bright', 'idea', 'asking', 'big', 'question', 'guess', 'Irish', 'tradition', 'women', 'propose', '29th', 'February', 'Now', 'am', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'do', ""n't"", 'most', 'women', 'want', 'man', 'propose', ""n't"", 'romance', 'stuff', 'Anyway', 'island', 'yes', 'guessed', 'things', 'go', 'haywire', 'up', 'meeting', 'Mathew', 'Goode', 'who', 'not', 'doctor.He', 'local', 'bar/restaurant', 'fighting', 'keep', 'being', 'repossessed', 'hangs', 'out', 'most', 'day', 'serving', 'up', 'alcohol', 'old', 'cronies', 'Mathew', 'best', 'effort', 'helping', 'Amy', 'get', 'back', 'Dublin', 'where', 'perfect', 'man', 'awaits', 'road', 'guessed', 'things', 'go', 'haywire', 'think', 'moral', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'find', 'happiness', 'must', 'first', 'have', 'crazy', 'yes', 'even', 'pretty', 'hilarious', 'things', 'happen', 'bizarre', 'antics', 'are', 'just', 'left', 'everyday', 'life', 'what', 'fun', 'that.I', 'enjoyed', 'Leap', 'Year', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'feel', 'connection', 'Amy', 'Mathew', 'were', 'several', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Let', 'face', 'facts', 'as', 'well', 'Ireland', 'beautiful', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'up', 'screen', 'smile', 'energetic', 'fun', 'filled', 'personality', ""n't"", 'generations', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'then', 'have', 'idea', 'way', 'up', 'Ok', 'not', 'good', 'barometer', 'am', 'third', 'glass', 'wine', 'get', 'point']",N/A

1332759,A1EHTFVSD0H7I6,B0038N9X3G,Kelly Klepfer,"[63, 67]","Leap Year is charming for several reasons. One. It is primarily set in Ireland and the lush scenery makes it visually delicious.Secondly, the classic storyline is freshly retold. A girl who is on the cusp of living her perfect-for-her fairy tale life, lacks one thing, an engagement ring. Her charming, but irresponsible father, reminds her of an Irish tradition. Every leap year, a woman is able to propose to the man she loves and then her dreams will come true. It had worked for a member of Anna's (Amy Adams) family.When Anna's cardiologist boyfriend fails to propose (oh, he delivers diamonds, but of the earring variety) the night before he leaves for a medical conference in Dublin, Anna decides enough time has passed and she'd grab hold of her dreams and use the Leap Year legend to make it happen. After all, Jeremy is already in Ireland, so there must be a wee bit of fate involved.Finally, there is serious heart in this movie. Declan (Matthew Goode) plays the angry, wounded bartender who agrees, after a series of travel mishaps, to haul Anna to Dublin. Anna, determined to create the secure life she never had as a child, begins to break down Declan's walls. As the two interact, they soften towards each other and begin to understand one another. There are a couple of satisfying scenes when realization dawns and both actors silently emote feelings that can't be put into words. Leap Year is an old-fashioned romantic story that didn't involve sex first, love later or require a lot of four letter words to make a point. Comfortably PG.Of course, this is romantic comedy/chick flick territory so there are predictable and yeah right moments.

I happen to be totally wrapped in an Amy Adams crush at the age of 50. I was so sad to hear about her pregnancy; not sad that she's pregnant, mind you. That's a blast. No, I'm sad that I never got a chance to be the Daddy of the expected bundle of joy.Leaving my yen for the pale skinned, freckled, red haired Ms. Adams to one side, LEAP YEAR takes place in Ireland (she fits right in, obviously). Amy plays Anna, a career-driven young American girl who is living in love with Jeremy, her cardiologist boyfriend. She gets a bit of a shock when, after four years, he blows a perfect moment to ask her to marry him.Following an old Irish tradition, she follows Jeremy to Ireland where he is presenting at a symposium, dedicated to asking him to marry her on Leap Day. Unfortunately, she is presented with a bit of an odyssey: Airports are closed due to a North Atlantic storm, her flight is diverted to Wales, the Fishguard Ferry is not running, and the boat she hires to cross the Irish Sea somehow ends up off the Dingle Peninsula. Given that Dingle is on the Atlantic coast, the opposite side of the country from Wales, I can only assume that this storm must have been related to Dorothy's famous cyclone.But never mind. Stranded in Dingle, Anna hires Declan (Matthew Goode) to drive her to Dublin. James Joyce in ULYSSES never came up with a more convoluted tale of wanderings. Considering that the Dingle-to-Dublin drive should take five hours maximum, the fact that they spend three days crossing a country smaller than New York State is inexplicable. But again, never mind. Amy's so lovely I'd follow her anywhere.Of course, love blossoms, even though Anna and Declan can't stand each other at first. He delivers her to Dublin, into the arms of Jeremy, who suddenly seems less  attractive to her than the rough-hewn Declan. Declan goes off, downcast. Anna and Jeremy get engaged in Dublin, and go home to Boston.It isn't long before Anna realizes where her heart lies, and wouldn't ye know it, but sure, 'n' begorrah, she predictably ends up back in Ireland. Everybody lives happily ever after, including Jeremy, who is more romantically linked to his bluetooth than to Anna. What a jerk!It's a chick flick par excellence, a date movie nonpareil, and if you're like me, you'll probably pay more attention to the girl on the screen than the girl sitting next to you. My advice is: Don't be a jerk. Kiss your date.

Bernabo,"[1, 4]","I considerAmy Adamsto be adorable, not just because I have an absolute affinity for alliteration but because it happens to be the truth.  So it is quite surprising to watch a romantic comedy in which she stars where I end up not liking her character and in the process find myself less enthralled with the idea of visiting the Emerald Isle of Ireland.  Adams plays Anna Brady, who spends her days staging apartments so that their sellers will find buyers, and her nights waiting for her boy friend, Jeremy (Adam Scott), a hot-shot heart surgeon, to finally pop the question.  After all, it has been four years and if they are going to move into a luxury townhouse together can the marital question be far behind?  Apparently not, and since Jeremy has a medical conference in Dublin, Anna's dad (John Lithgow) has a convenient family legend regarding women in Ireland asking men to marry them on leap year, and it is a leap year (I presume 2008), our heroine jets across the pond to take advantage of the situation.  That situation is immediately complicated when the jet is forced down in Wales rather than Ireland and Anna has trouble getting transportation to Ireland in general and Dublin in particular.  Along this troubled way Anna comes across Declan (Matthew Goode), who runs an inn and agrees, for a price, to drive Anna in his ""taxi.""At this point, even if you have not seen a trailer for the film, you know that fate and the screenplay by Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont (who also had a hand in doing the script for ""Made of Honor""), are going to have Anna end up with Declan rather than Jeremy (although I was actually holding out hope for more of a twist in the end like with ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" and that Anna would do exactly what she set out to do).  When the plot is pretty much phoned in from the beginning it is hard to fault the actors for being incapable of making the proceedings much better.  Besides the obvious fact that the two lead characters are supposed to fall in love there is no clear motivation for either one of them to do so.  If anything, between her penchant for property damage and his caustic comments (even with the brogue), there are clear reasons for each to want to be quits with the other as quick as possible.  But they are required to end up together, so that is what director Anand Tucker (""Hilary and Jackie"") provides.There is the Irish scenery to enjoy and a mild collection of colorful Irish characters, none of whom are memorable, at least not by the high standards set by ""The Quiet Man.""  But since I was not enjoying the characters or the plot, it is hard to recommend the film just on the basis of the pretty background, especially when there is an old stone church in the rain, which just begs for John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara to show up instead of Anna and Declan.  There is also the implicit moral that love is more important than a job, at least the job of staging apartments, although it the current housing market Anna's profession might not strike audiences as being as vacuous as the film's conclusion suggests.  My criteria for judging romantic comedies usually requires either an appropriate ""big gesture"" on the part of one of the parties, usually the guy, or at least a heartfelt declaration.  Movie romances tend way more towards the latter (e.g., ""Jerry Maguire"") than the former (e.g., ""Love Actually""), but either way it requires more than just showing up, which is all this movie offers in the end.",3,It is sad when Amy Adams makes a romantic comedy that is not enjoyable,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,3477,"['considerAmy', 'Adamsto', 'be', 'adorable', 'not', 'just', 'have', 'absolute', 'affinity', 'alliteration', 'be', 'truth', 'quite', 'surprising', 'watch', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'liking', 'character', 'process', 'find', 'less', 'enthralled', 'idea', 'visiting', 'Emerald', 'Isle', 'Ireland', 'Adams', 'Anna', 'Brady', 'who', 'days', 'staging', 'apartments', 'so', 'sellers', 'will', 'find', 'buyers', 'nights', 'waiting', 'boy', 'friend', 'Jeremy', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'hot-shot', 'heart', 'surgeon', 'finally', 'pop', 'question', 'been', 'four', 'years', 'are', 'going', 'move', 'luxury', 'together', 'can', 'marital', 'question', 'be', 'far', 'Apparently', 'not', 'Jeremy', 'medical', 'conference', 'Dublin', 'Anna', 'dad', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'convenient', 'family', 'legend', 'regarding', 'women', 'Ireland', 'asking', 'men', 'marry', 'leap', 'year', 'leap', 'year', 'presume', '2008', 'heroine', 'jets', 'pond', 'take', 'advantage', 'situation', 'situation', 'immediately', 'complicated', 'when', 'jet', 'forced', 'down', 'Wales', 'rather', 'Ireland', 'Anna', 'trouble', 'getting', 'transportation', 'Ireland', 'general', 'Dublin', 'particular', 'troubled', 'way', 'Anna', 'Declan', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'who', 'inn', 'agrees', 'price', 'drive', 'Anna', 'taxi', 'point', 'even', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'trailer', 'film', 'know', 'fate', 'screenplay', 'Deborah', 'Kaplan', 'Harry', 'Elfont', 'who', 'also', 'had', 'hand', 'doing', 'script', 'Made', 'Honor', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'Anna', 'end', 'up', 'Declan', 'rather', 'Jeremy', 'was', 'actually', 'holding', 'out', 'hope', 'more', 'twist', 'end', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'Anna', 'would', 'do', 'exactly', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'When', 'plot', 'pretty', 'much', 'phoned', 'beginning', 'hard', 'fault', 'actors', 'being', 'incapable', 'making', 'proceedings', 'much', 'better', 'obvious', 'fact', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'are', 'supposed', 'fall', 'love', 'clear', 'motivation', 'one', 'do', 'so', 'anything', 'penchant', 'property', 'damage', 'caustic', 'comments', 'even', 'brogue', 'are', 'clear', 'reasons', 'want', 'be', 'quits', 'other', 'as', 'quick', 'possible', 'are', 'required', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'what', 'director', 'Anand', 'Tucker', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'Irish', 'scenery', 'enjoy', 'mild', 'collection', 'colorful', 'Irish', 'characters', 'none', 'whom', 'are', 'memorable', 'least', 'not', 'high', 'standards', 'set', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'was', 'not', 'enjoying', 'characters', 'plot', 'hard', 'recommend', 'film', 'just', 'basis', 'pretty', 'background', 'especially', 'when', 'old', 'stone', 'church', 'rain', 'just', 'begs', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'show', 'up', 'instead', 'Anna', 'Declan', 'also', 'implicit', 'moral', 'love', 'more', 'important', 'job', 'least', 'job', 'staging', 'apartments', 'current', 'housing', 'market', 'Anna', 'profession', 'might', 'not', 'strike', 'audiences', 'as', 'being', 'as', 'vacuous', 'film', 'conclusion', 'criteria', 'judging', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'usually', 'appropriate', 'big', 'gesture', 'part', 'one', 'parties', 'usually', 'guy', 'least', 'heartfelt', 'declaration', 'Movie', 'romances', 'tend', 'way', 'more', 'latter', 'e.g.', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'former', 'e.g.', 'Love', 'Actually', 'way', 'more', 'just', 'showing', 'up', 'movie', 'end']",N/A

But this overdid it and was SO LOUSY. Seriously. It follows the cookie-cutter recipe of girl trying to get to a city/person but her travel plans are interrupted due to ""unforeseeable circumstances"" and she has to rely on some good looking, rough-on-the-outside, chocolate-covered-candy-on-the-inside hunk with a ""sensitive heart"" who treats her like crap, to get to her destination. All with the obligatory falling face-down into the mud stuff and having your luggage stolen to sleeping in a cozy hotel where she gets to wear a nice outfit and sweep him off his feet at the dance the same night. It was great in ""Romancing the Stone"" but it is kind of lame and unoriginal in this one, as there is no comedy here and the two main characters dont have an ounce of chemistry between them. Everything is absurd and obviously set up to illicit laughs, like Adams' character continuing to walk around in high heels on dirt roads - even though at that point she still had her luggage on her and could easily have changed to comfortable shoes. But I guess if your script and ""comedy"" rely on her dragging her heels through dirt, cause it's supposed to be so funny, you cant have the character be sensible or have common sense.Every scene is cliche and predictable and Amy Adams has a boring personality. The supposed heart-warming comedy and romance consists of scenes like Goode (main male character) actually ripping off the head of a chicken in front of her (literally rip off) and then they are seen five minutes later having a candle-light dinner over that. ""Coq au Vin and vino after the slaughter"". How truly romantic. I do eat chicken, but I dont cozy up with it first and then rip its head off to devour. Totally inappropriate and tasteless.This movie is filled with junk like that. Not only do the characters not have any chemistry between them but they also themselves lack dimension. I loved Romancing the Stone and ""Moonlighting"" - you know, where there is some kind of antagonism between the two main characters and the way they come closer after a lot of obstacles, but in this movie it was just fake and forced. They seriously miscasted and I could not believe how truly boring and unimaginative it was. Rom-com doesnt mean predictable, stupid and boring.  I could predict what was going to happen in _every frame_ -  that's how lame it was.I give it one star (it didnt deserve any) because of the gorgeous Irish landscape. Other than that I recommend looking out of the window instead of at this movie, cause chances are what you see happening out there is far more interesting and enticing than this comatose piece of crap with unlikable, dumb characters.",1,"Boring, Trite, Painfully Predictable Movie.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[3, 4]","Being Irish myself I was somewhat interested in checking out this rom com with Amy Adams, another excellent reason to see any movie.So, legend has it that in Ireland a woman can propose to a man on the leap day of a leap year. When an anticipated proposal does not emanate from her doctor boyfriend, Anna hears of this legend and so she has to go to Dublin to propose. Imagine. Dublin.So, Murphy's Law intervenes, and the flight gets diverted, to Wales, and to make a long story short has to take a really roundabout route to get there in a beat up old Renault 4, with an obnoxious yet somewhat charming Irish guy, who gives her no respect. And Murphy, well, he just keeps getting in the way, and will she even get to Dublin.But, if you put a woman in a car with a charming Irish guy for any length of time, warm feelings can start to develop. So, things happen they way they do, and it's all done with great humor, the scenery is fantastic, it's like an Irish postcard at times. Amy Adams is amazing, and her costar, Matthew Goode is also excellent.The one thing I will say is every Hollywood movie about Ireland has the obligatory cows blocking the road scene. It does happen, but come on.I think you would really enjoy this movie, and I highly recommend it. If you like this type of movie, considerThe Quiet Man (Collector's Edition), with John Wayne and Maureen O Hara, really the classic of its kind, and The Matchmaker with Janeane Garofalo, and most recent Cecelia Ahern's movie P.S.

El-Hewie""","[2, 7]","Leap Year [Theatrical Release]:The intermarriage between the American ideal and the Irish ideal was displayed on exhilarating background of natural sceneries and cultural richness. The act transcends the viewer from the fast pace and intangible life style of urban America to the laid back and superstitious rural Ireland. The young American urbanite perceived the world in her naive and idealistic way, pursued her dream of marrying an Irish surgeon, believing that her true dream would subdue the whole universe to give way to her rosy romance. She landed on the Irish shores in the same style of the D-Day landing on Normandy.In her two-day adventure to get to Dublin on the 29 of February for the sake of proposing to her future spouse, she was exposed to the true and diverse Irish tradition. Few hints might have alerted her that her bizarre pursuit was the most ridiculous, her whole existence was that of a con artist, and her entire motive was irrational.  Nature managed to prepare her for the unexpected shock of a phony marriage. She overcome the flight delay, the turbulent weather, the hail and rain, the drunkards and muggers, and was fortunate to run into a hidden love that she missed in her clouded mind and that will shine on a later date.The exotic beauty of Ireland contrasted with the intoxicated, jaundiced, and obese Irish population made the movie more fascinating. The young American red-head did not believe in superstitions of the curse of running into a black cat prior to a trip, the curse of traveling on Sundays, or that of the full moon, yet she believed in her dream love that could not wait for her arrival to Dublin. There, in Dublin, she faced the harsh reality that she was being used by the surgeon to secure a green card for his residency in America. She fell back on the Irish bag-handler who was very fortunate to have an incidental miracle falling on his lap, out of the blue skies.Comparing this movie to ""Not Without My Daughter"", ""Green Card"", and ""The Proposal"", you get a good sense of the unique melting pot of the American culture.  The four movies dealt of consequences of marriages between Americans, French, Canadians, and Irish, in different time of the modern immigration era. Add to the mix Barak Obama's Kenyan -American-Indonesian intermarriage that produced a major figure to the International theatre.My heart went to the many Irish folks idling in dark bars, the rosy dreams of the young and pretty girl, and the charisma of the Irish escort who ended up with the biggest prize of his life.

I don't get some of the good reviews here on Amazon and I have to wonder if they're from truly impartial people. They're so far from what the majority of reviews say on other sites.At the core, the script was very poorly done. While Amy Adam's character was developed to some extent, Matthew's character was not. His character came off as shallow, non-communicative, rude, distant, and apart from his appearance, completely undesirable. There was nothing about this character that any woman would want. At no time was there even a moment of heat or chemistry between Matthew and Amy. Zip. Zero.Other reviews on Amazon say this movie was filled with funny moments. If you've seen the previews, you've seen every comical moment. And taken in context, they were not really funny. Contrary to what the Amazon featured review is saying, the film was dull, slow and not romantic AT ALL.Matthew Goode and Amy Adams did a great job with what they were given.

The one thing (beside the knowledge that Amy Adams starred) I knew in advance was that this wasn't a Nicholas Sparks film.  That was enough to entice me to at least give the film a try. ;-)Seriously, this film is the anti-Nicholas Sparks film.  Sure it may be just as predictable and just as romantic (or at least it tries to be), but it doesn't rip out the heart of the viewer/reader in the way Sparks *always* does.  Is this film perhaps a bit boring because of this?  Well, no, not really.  It offers the lovely and perky Amy Adams as she, and others around her, suffer through various mishaps while she's on her way to force the issue with her mate of the last 4 years.  4 long years without a proposal.Adams takes flight to Ireland to take advantage of an old Irish tradition of having the woman propose to the man on Leap day, February 29th.  Why that particular day rather than any other day is a question that we don't get to ask.  If we did, well then we'd likely not get this film, or at least wouldn't have the title and main plot point to revolve around.  Regardless, apparently Adams' character (Anna) isn't interested enough in womens liberation to just pop the question without the need to travel or pick a special day, so travel she does and from there we, the viewers, get the pleasure of watching a journey that would remind viewers old enough to remember the filmPlanes, Trains and Automobiles (Those Aren't Pillows Edition)of that journey.Relatively early on in the journey Anna meets Declan (Matthew Goode) and contracts his services to get to her final destination, Dublin, Ireland.  Predictably the two wind up growing close as they travel and the seeds of a romance are sewn even as Anna frets over getting to Dublin on time to seek the hand of her boyfriend Jeremy (Adam Scott).Yes the film is predictable, but then again, not in the ways that a viewer/reader would find in a Sparks written/inspired film.  The basics are predictable here, but even as we might grow to predict and expect a certain result, that's not necessarily what is delivered.  Instead we get to think a bit more and are drawn a bit further along in the story as we hope for a certain result but wonder whether or not it will come to pass.The acting here is good, the story is entertaining, and the scenery is very nice (and impressive) though the color pallete is a bit more constrained than say that used in the filmMy Life in Ruins [Blu-ray] (a film where the scenery pretty much becomes the star of the film) or another film that also features some lovely Irish sceneryP.S.

1332864,AIYF0LFBRKFS3,B0038N9X3G,T. Florio,"[3, 4]","I personally winced throughout this whole movie yet the person I watched this with liked it alot.  I think that explanation comes from her enjoyment of Hallmark channel movies and Leap year sharing many of the traits of this channel's films.  As she had little misgivings, I think she would have rated this movie a 4 or 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.My opinion is quite different. I've given this movie two stars because it is technically competent.  My criticism is directed at the script.  The characters do things not because it might be the natural progression from their previous actions or personalities but because there are areas in a typical romantic comedy when they need to happen.Amy Adams' character was insufferable thanks to the script and her redundant, rattling dialog (I felt like yelling ""We get it, already!"" at the screen) while Goode's nice touches were undone by the same script.  Even the two sections in the script where some background to the two leads seems shoehorned in and rote.  The bulk of John Lithgow's performance can be seen in the deleted scenes and that is for the best as his performance was broad and lent very little to the movie.  Unfortunately the scene of his that did make the cut was just for exposition's sake and could have been cut as well with a little script polish.  And then there are the quaint Irish folk, three of which are there for ""comic relief"" sake only and, like everyone in the script with maybe the exception of Adam Scott's one-note character, come across as fictional characters written by a screenwriter whose only personal experience in writing movies and creating characters comes from years of watching and trying to emulate other romantic comedy movies -- and not doing well at that.A great example of this is a dinner scene where the couple sit down with an Irish husband and wife and an Italian couple.  After the whole ""lets make believe we are a real couple in love"" bit, the two leads become audience to a disturbingly long (and not a bit funny, IMHO)deep passionate kiss, followed by an even more disturbing prodding by the Irish hosts' incessant (and supposedly funny and quaint?)prodding for the two leads to engage in a passionate kiss.Everything in this movie can be seen coming a mile away and I found it insulting the screenwriter and director didn't recognize that the audience would.  Strictly cookie-cutter.I could go on about each scene (and did any viewer NOT know the walk to the castle would result in a missed mode of transport?) but I would bore.  The upshot is, if you are a viewer who needs to see a bit of truth in their movies (that is, truth in situation, character , dialog and emotion), you will likely hate this movie with a passion.  I would put it right up with Jackie Chan's The Spy Next Door in that emotional and contexual truth department.  However, if you can park reality at the door and enjoy a love story that has no basis in reality, then you will enjoy this movie.  There is nothing in this movie that would make me want to see it again for the rest of my life.  If you, like me, enjoy movies set in Ireland, note this: It makes Jeanine Garafalo's(sp) The Matchmaker look authentic by comparison, and that's going a long way.  But atleast that love story could be taken without wincing.  The minute one of the three old Irishmen predicts early in the movie that the two leads will probably kill each other, you'll most likely find yourself loathing the screenwriter and director for even throwing that in there because there's no mistaking the blatant conventions of the romantic comedy this film is following makes that predicition feel like you're being patronized.",2,Basically a Hallmark movie,1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,3670,"['personally', 'winced', 'whole', 'movie', 'yet', 'person', 'watched', 'liked', 'think', 'explanation', 'enjoyment', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'movies', 'Leap', 'year', 'sharing', 'many', 'traits', 'channel', 'films', 'had', 'little', 'misgivings', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'movie', '4', '4', '1/2', '5', 'stars.My', 'opinion', 'quite', 'different', ""'ve"", 'given', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'technically', 'competent', 'criticism', 'directed', 'script', 'characters', 'do', 'things', 'not', 'might', 'be', 'natural', 'progression', 'previous', 'actions', 'personalities', 'are', 'areas', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'when', 'need', 'happen.Amy', 'Adams', 'character', 'was', 'insufferable', 'thanks', 'script', 'redundant', 'rattling', 'dialog', 'felt', 'yelling', 'get', 'already', 'screen', 'Goode', 'nice', 'touches', 'were', 'undone', 'same', 'script', 'Even', 'two', 'sections', 'script', 'where', 'background', 'two', 'leads', 'shoehorned', 'rote', 'bulk', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'performance', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'best', 'performance', 'was', 'broad', 'lent', 'very', 'little', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'scene', 'did', 'make', 'cut', 'was', 'just', 'exposition', 'sake', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'script', 'polish', 'then', 'are', 'quaint', 'Irish', 'folk', 'three', 'are', 'there', 'comic', 'relief', 'sake', 'only', 'everyone', 'script', 'maybe', 'exception', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'one-note', 'character', 'come', 'fictional', 'characters', 'written', 'screenwriter', 'only', 'personal', 'experience', 'writing', 'movies', 'creating', 'characters', 'years', 'watching', 'trying', 'emulate', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'movies', 'not', 'doing', 'well', 'that.A', 'great', 'example', 'dinner', 'scene', 'where', 'couple', 'sit', 'down', 'Irish', 'husband', 'wife', 'Italian', 'couple', 'whole', 'lets', 'make', 'believe', 'are', 'real', 'couple', 'love', 'bit', 'two', 'become', 'audience', 'disturbingly', 'long', 'not', 'bit', 'funny', 'IMHO', 'deep', 'passionate', 'kiss', 'followed', 'even', 'more', 'disturbing', 'prodding', 'Irish', 'hosts', 'incessant', 'supposedly', 'funny', 'quaint', 'prodding', 'two', 'leads', 'engage', 'passionate', 'kiss.Everything', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'found', 'insulting', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'audience', 'would', 'Strictly', 'cookie-cutter.I', 'could', 'go', 'scene', 'did', 'viewer', 'NOT', 'know', 'walk', 'castle', 'would', 'result', 'missed', 'mode', 'transport', 'would', 'bore', 'upshot', 'are', 'viewer', 'who', 'see', 'bit', 'truth', 'movies', 'truth', 'situation', 'character', 'dialog', 'emotion', 'will', 'likely', 'hate', 'movie', 'passion', 'would', 'put', 'right', 'up', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Spy', 'Next', 'Door', 'emotional', 'contexual', 'truth', 'department', 'However', 'can', 'park', 'reality', 'door', 'enjoy', 'love', 'story', 'basis', 'reality', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'nothing', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'rest', 'life', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'set', 'Ireland', 'note', 'Jeanine', 'Garafalo', 'sp', 'Matchmaker', 'look', 'authentic', 'comparison', 'going', 'long', 'way', 'atleast', 'love', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'taken', 'wincing', 'minute', 'one', 'three', 'old', 'Irishmen', 'early', 'movie', 'two', 'leads', 'will', 'probably', 'kill', 'other', ""'ll"", 'most', 'likely', 'find', 'loathing', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'even', 'throwing', 'mistaking', 'blatant', 'conventions', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'film', 'following', 'predicition', 'feel', ""'re"", 'being', 'patronized']",N/A

Ready to take the leap - she travels to Ireland hopefully in time to ask her boyfriend to marry her on February 29 (leap year day). Of course nothing goes as planned, and she has plenty of roadblocks along the way that threaten to thwart her plans, including a surly Irish tour guide and cows galore.This movie sounds like it might be a refreshing change of pace romantic comedy, but there is plenty of ""been there, seen that"" moments to give viewers a sense of deja vu.  I felt like I was watching a romanticized version of ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles (Those Aren't Pillows Edition)"" and not a good one at that.  There is little chemistry between the two leads, and even less between Amy and her long-term boyfriend. The entire story is a bit tedious and the only thing that kept me glued (other than the hope that things might get better) was the Irish countryside (though all Irish characters were a bit stereotypical).I know that this is nit picky, but I am so tired of watching movies and television shows in which heroines travel internationally and wear impractical $600 stilettos that inevitably get muddied, soaking wet, or trudged through animal feces when the heroine eventually finds herself having to walk.  When I see one of these such travelers in an airport, I pray that they are seated behind me and the emergency life boat so they won't deflate it.A much more believable and enjoyable fish out of water tale set in Ireland is ""Matchmaker"" starring Janeane Garofalo as a cynical Boston political consultant stuck in a small Irish town during a matchmaking festival.",2,The scenery was better than the movie,1291075200,"11 30, 2010",2010,1678,"['Amy', 'Adams', 'home', 'stager', 'who', 'move', 'doctor', 'boyfriend', 'four', 'years', 'Ready', 'take', 'leap', 'Ireland', 'hopefully', 'time', 'ask', 'boyfriend', 'marry', 'February', '29', 'leap', 'year', 'day', 'course', 'nothing', 'as', 'planned', 'plenty', 'roadblocks', 'way', 'thwart', 'plans', 'including', 'surly', 'Irish', 'tour', 'guide', 'galore.This', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'plenty', 'been', 'there', 'seen', 'moments', 'give', 'viewers', 'sense', 'deja', 'vu', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'romanticized', 'version', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'Are', ""n't"", 'Pillows', 'Edition', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'little', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'even', 'less', 'Amy', 'long-term', 'boyfriend', 'entire', 'story', 'bit', 'tedious', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'glued', 'other', 'hope', 'things', 'might', 'get', 'better', 'was', 'Irish', 'countryside', 'Irish', 'characters', 'were', 'bit', 'stereotypical', '.I', 'know', 'nit', 'picky', 'am', 'so', 'tired', 'watching', 'movies', 'television', 'shows', 'heroines', 'travel', 'internationally', 'wear', 'impractical', '600', 'stilettos', 'inevitably', 'get', 'muddied', 'soaking', 'wet', 'trudged', 'animal', 'feces', 'when', 'heroine', 'eventually', 'having', 'walk', 'When', 'see', 'one', 'such', 'travelers', 'airport', 'pray', 'are', 'seated', 'emergency', 'life', 'boat', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deflate', 'it.A', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'enjoyable', 'fish', 'water', 'tale', 'set', 'Ireland', 'Matchmaker', 'starring', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'cynical', 'Boston', 'political', 'consultant', 'stuck', 'small', 'Irish', 'town', 'matchmaking', 'festival']",N/A

The cast is delightful, and the plot filled with humorous scenes.Leap year is a romantic comedy about a Anna (Amy Adams) who wants to get married to Jeremy (Adam Scott) her boyfriend of four years.  He, not wishing the commitment, travels to Ireland on business.  She takes her grandfather's advice and also travels to Ireland, where it is rumored that a girl can propose marriage on the 29th of February.Anna having trouble getting an airline to Dublin, takes alternate travel and lands in Wales.  Desperate for time she hires a boat that, due to a storm, drops her on the beach at a small village on the wrong side of Ireland.The village is only served by a weekly bus, has no Inn for lodging, and the only business open is a bar.  She meets the handsome bartender, Declan (Matthew Goode), who informs her that the rumored practice is a myth, not a tradition.  And the fun begins.I do not usually watch romantic movies, but my wife likes them, so I agreed to watch Leap Year with her.  I enjoyed the film.  It is funny, includes brilliant repartee, outstanding scenery, and some decent acting.  I recommend this film.  I will watch it again, if only for the views of the majestic Irish landscape.",5,Picturesque and Comical,1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,1315,"['.This', 'film', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'movie', 'filmed', 'Ireland', 'scenery', 'gorgeous', 'lush', 'amatory', 'cast', 'delightful', 'plot', 'filled', 'humorous', 'scenes.Leap', 'year', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Anna', 'Amy', 'Adams', 'who', 'get', 'married', 'Jeremy', 'Adam', 'Scott', 'boyfriend', 'four', 'years', 'not', 'wishing', 'commitment', 'travels', 'Ireland', 'business', 'grandfather', 'advice', 'also', 'travels', 'Ireland', 'where', 'rumored', 'girl', 'can', 'propose', 'marriage', '29th', 'February.Anna', 'having', 'trouble', 'getting', 'airline', 'Dublin', 'alternate', 'travel', 'Wales', 'Desperate', 'time', 'boat', 'due', 'storm', 'beach', 'small', 'village', 'wrong', 'side', 'Ireland.The', 'village', 'only', 'served', 'weekly', 'bus', 'Inn', 'lodging', 'only', 'business', 'open', 'bar', 'handsome', 'bartender', 'Declan', 'Matthew', 'Goode', 'who', 'rumored', 'practice', 'myth', 'not', 'tradition', 'fun', 'begins.I', 'do', 'not', 'usually', 'watch', 'romantic', 'movies', 'wife', 'so', 'agreed', 'watch', 'Leap', 'Year', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'funny', 'brilliant', 'repartee', 'outstanding', 'scenery', 'decent', 'acting', 'recommend', 'film', 'will', 'watch', 'again', 'only', 'views', 'majestic', 'Irish', 'landscape']",N/A
