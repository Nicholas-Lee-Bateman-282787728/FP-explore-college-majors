For the most part, I was pulled in by Will Smith's torn character; and even though I new the ending well before it was arrived, it didn't matter to me. I liked the ethical dilemmas it brought up, and the questions it raised. The movie definitely tries to hard to tug at the heartstrings, and usually this bothers me. But for some reason, I guess I felt it wasn't overly done, and I even found myself moved at the end.

1230668,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B001QERPAM,Amanda Richards,"[1, 4]","Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Will Smith stars in a blockbuster movie that's not released in the summer2. If you didn't like him in Pursuit of Happyness, you won't like him in this one3. If you can survive the rather boring first section, you'll get by just fine with the rest.4. Essentially, Will's character is working on atonement for a momentary lapse of concentration two years prior to the events of this movie.5. He's willing to give an eye for an eye, and his pound of flesh where necessary6. He sure takes his time getting it done.7. Box jellyfish should not be served fresh over crushed ice.8. Rosario Dawson and aforementioned jellyfish steal several scenes.This is a rather long, slow drama, as opposed to the action stuff you usually associate with Will Smith.  He does however act his socks off in this one, as he works on his own personal redemption programme.  Rosario Dawson provides strong support as his love interest, and even though their roles are short, look for Woody Harrelson, Barry Pepper, Connor (son of Tom) Cruise and of course, the jellyfish.Good acting, good casting, interesting concept, but the screenplay could have been trimmed substantially, especially at the beginning.Ben Thomas:  ""In seven days, God created the world.

1230670,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B001QERPAM,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","SEVEN POUNDS is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. It's's been on my mind ever since the credit scroll.A sensitive and profoundly sad story is brilliantly handled by Will Smith.Prior to this picture, writer Grant Nieporte was a crew member on a few TV sitcoms. His remarkable big screen debut incorporates elements of Nieporte's life and experiences. To cite a couple of examples: The author's wife is an aficionado and operator of antique printing presses, as is Emily Posa (Dawson), a woman who's too disabled by congestive heart failure to continue her home business. Nieporte got the film's central plot point from someone he met: a man who accidentally caused a tragedy that made nationwide headlines.Smith here plays Ben Thomas. Ben's future and desire to live were destroyed by a momentary lapse of attention that resulted in seven deaths, including his fianc&eacute;e's. Wracked with guilt and perpetual thoughts of suicide, Ben is still able to piece together a plan that may not alleviate his self-torment, but will positively affect the lives of seven people, a sort-of cosmic exchange for the seven souls he took in a car wreck.One of the chosen is Ben's  younger brother (Ealy), the others are strangers he gets involved with through various means. Of these six, Ben becomes attached to Emily, who is desperately ill and in need of a heart transplant. Their romance is exquisitely bittersweet, for it may end when an already broken heart simply stops beating.The story's resolution is a tearful one, yet is so beautifully uplifting. Although the plot may be a tad confusing until the last 20 minutes or so, we can eventually see all the clues that were laid out for us along the way. Pondering these neatly fitted pieces after the puzzle was completed has kept my mind busy for several hours. It's been time well-spent.SEVEN POUNDS grossed nearly $170 million worldwide, yet I'd never heard of it until recently. I'm so glad I found this one and very highly recommend it!.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(7.5) Seven Pounds (2008) - Will Smith/Rosario Dawson/Woody Harrelson/Michael Ealy/Barry Pepper/Bill Smitrovich",5,"Ben Thomas: ""In seven days, God created the world.

1230672,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001QERPAM,Chris Pandolfi,"[7, 10]","""Seven Pounds"" is so smitten with the size of its heart that it never takes the audience's heads into consideration. It tells the story of a man who takes it upon himself to change the lives of seven strangers, all because of his own painful past. For something that was intended to be heartfelt and inspiring, I was shocked at how implausible and self-indulgent it was. I also found it a little creepy; Will Smith's character--IRS agent Ben Thomas--essentially spies on these strangers to make sure that they're decent people. He stares at them while standing in dark corners. He retrieves their personal information from an IRS database. And worst of all, he comes into their lives completely unannounced and then pressures them into following his lead. In return, he asks that he never be tracked down. Does this sound like someone you'd want help from?I'm forced to go along with the film's ad campaign and not reveal why Ben is compelled to help these people. Let's just say that he has his reasons, and that I understood them. His process: He uses his position of power to get to know specific people, to determine whether or not they're good people that deserve to be helped. What I didn't understand was the ease with which everything was done; there are far too many scenes that defy logic, not the least of which involve Ben casually strolling into areas of hospitals that are normally very secure. Some have speculated that ""Seven Pounds"" is supposed to be a fable about redemption and sacrifice, meaning that a little suspension of disbelief is required. But I take issue with that, mostly because I'm not entirely convinced that Ben actually redeemed himself at the end of the film. His actions seemed more motivated by guilt than by charity.Despite the fact that he helps seven people, Ben mostly focuses on Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), who's in serious need of a heart transplant. She finds Ben interesting from the very start, which I found impossible to believe. How can she be so interested in a man she knows nothing about? And why would she continue to show an interest when Ben makes it clear that he doesn't want to talk about himself? Their friendship and inevitable romance felt painfully contrived, and it doesn't help that Ben so mysteriously enters and exits her life.The other six people are so infrequently shown that I'm surprised they were even included. So as not to spoil any crucial plot points, I'll only describe two of them. First, there's Connie Tepos (Elpidia Carrillo), who's too frightened to take her children and leave her abusive boyfriend. Is it enough that we're only told about her abuse and not actually shown it? Second, there's Ezra Turner (Woody Harrelson), a blind telemarketer and pianist. His blindness is his only handicap, so I'm not too sure why Ben wants to help him so badly. After all, blind people are not automatically helpless. But Ben seems to think that something is wrong, which is why, at the beginning of the film, he tests to see if Ezra will get angry by calling him at work and berating him for being a coward. Personally, I don't see how that would inspire anyone to better themselves.Emily, Connie, and Ezra, along with three other people, all receive a gift from Ben at one point or another. What he gives them, I'm afraid I can't say. How he does it, I also can't say. What I can say is that it ties in with the title, which I had trouble figuring out before seeing the film.The filmmakers were aiming for something meaningful, but that's hard to find when the story is buried underneath layers of mystery and melodrama. At a certain point, I no longer cared why Ben wanted to help seven strangers; I didn't care for his methods, and even if I did, none of them were believable to begin with. This brings me to the ending, which would have been touching had it not been for the logistical issues weighing it down. The misguided emotional impact is reflected in Angelo Milli's score, which features a piano solo that continuously hits a completely inappropriate dissonant chord.I really wanted to like ""Seven Pounds."" The idea is solid, and goodness knows Will Smith and Rosario Dawson are great actors. But it's too ponderous and enigmatic for its own good; it's so concerned with trying to be deep and complex that it somehow forgot to be either one. It's a strange, problematic film, one that wants us to guess more than it's willing to explain. And when someone can freely impose himself on someone else, as Ben Thomas can, I feel uneasy, and this is despite the fact that he had the best of intentions. I can't give you an idea of what I mean--the mysterious nature of the plot doesn't allow for it. But if you see this film, you'll understand where I'm coming from. Maybe I'm uncomfortable with the idea of resolving personal problems by trying to solve everyone else's. Is such a thing even possible? When you can't even forgive yourself, the last thing you need is to be responsible for someone.",3,Your Friendly Neighboorhood Tax Collector is Here to Help,1230076800,"12 24,

Another wonderful collaboration between director Gabriele Muccino and Will Smith since ""The Pursuit of Happyness"".  Will Smith is absolutely magnificent in this film!""God created the world in seven days.  In seven seconds, I shattered mine.""The film starts off with a man named (Will Smith) who calls 911 and will be committing suicide.We are now watching a flashback of Ben Thomas, a man who works in the IRS and is currently auditing several people and trying to judge their character if they are good or if they are bad and if he is willing to help them or not.For Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), she has a bad heart and is in need of a transplant but after being hospitalized, you see Ben trying to audit her and trying to get to know her.For Ezra Turner (Woody Harrelson) who is blind, Ben is rather mean to him in regards to his blindness on the phone.  Ezra wonders how this guy knows about him, but Ben hangs up on him.For Connie Tepos (Elpidia Carrilo), she is an abused mother, which Ben is trying to help out.Throughout the film, you see Ben as he tries to help all these people but the question is, why is someone working for the IRS going so far to get involved in the personal lives of these people?  Ben starts to become part of the life of Emily who she becomes attracted to  and why he continues to watch seven people and learn about their personal lives is a mystery. Ben becomes instrumental in these people lives in some way.If anything, no one knows why Ben is behaving this way or why he is helping them.  But when they try to understand, he shuts off his emotions and doesn't want to explain anything about himself.You then start to see flashbacks of Ben where he works at a major corporation and happy in life with his fiance, an accident and Ben's fiance laying bloody and obviously dead from a car accident, you then see conversations with Ben and his brother (Michael Ealy) about Ben taking something of his.  You get a sense that the way Ben is now, something bad has happened and made his life so tragic.And you realize that Ben may not be the IRS agent that these people thinks he may be.  Who is he?Unfortunately, I can't go into the story much further than that because it would spoil the whole film but what I can say is that Will Smith's performance as this man who has suffered so much in his life is wanting to give back, but give back to these seven strangers in his own way, is absolutely magnificent in this film.Working together with director Gabriele Muccino who directed Smith's last emotional film ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" (which Smith received an Oscar nomination), the two definitely have good chemistry because of all the films that we have seen of Smith, both films directed by Muccino has brought out a side of Smith that is not usually seen in his action movies.VIDEO & AUDIO:""SEVEN POUNDS"" is featured in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1.  The film utilizes a lot of darkness with blues and blacks to showcase the life of Ben Thomas, while the life of Tim Thomas is showcased with vibrant colors.The scenes shot outdoor are quite colorful and you can see how the character of Emily (Rosario Dawson) tries to bring Ben out of the darkness into her world which is vibrant and colorful.  Despite the fact that Emily has a bad heart, she's able to enjoy her life and the fact is, Ben has brought her happiness and thus, picture quality showcases the transcending of dark to colorful vibrancy.  But then reverting back to the dark and painful life that Ben has lived.Overall, the picture quality was well done and it was captured well on film and in high definition.As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby True HD 5.1 (for English and French).  The film is pretty much dialogue-based but there are some instances where you can hear outdoor ambiance of people through your rear channel speakers.  There is usage of classic music during the film which also comes out clear but overall, the film is a dialogue-based film that comes out clearly through the front channel.SPECIAL FEATURES:For the special features of ""SEVEN POUNDS"", the following features are included:* Commentary with Director Gabriele Muccino - Listening to the commentary, you learn that Muccino is a gentleman and appreciative of what his crew has done for him.  You learn a lot about his filmmaking style and what he wanted to accomplish in the film.  But if there was one caveat about the commentary, Muccino speaks with a heavy Italian accent with some broken English and thus is difficult to understand a little but otherwise, really good insight on the film.* Seven Views on Seven Pounds - This segment features seven views from those who worked on the film.THE WRITERS -  In this four minute segment, writer Grant Nieporte talks about how he was inspired to write about the film.  He got the idea from a man he met at a party who was so sad and killed himself.  He came to learn that the man died because he was responsible for a disaster and never recovered from it.THE PRODUCERS -  A three minute segment featuring interviews with producers Jason Blumenthall, Todd Black and James Lassister of reuniting with the team behind ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and also Will Smith's first role as a producer.THE DIRECTOR -  A six minute segment on Gabriele Muccino and working together with Will Smith again.THE LOCATION MANAGER -  A six minute interview with Kei Rowan-Young who was the location manager and trying to find various locations to shoot and behind hired early, so she can find the right beach house in So. Cal.THE DESIGNER - A two minute segment featuring an interview with Michael Riva in regards to designs for Will Smith, of his character who is highly organized and clean.THE EDITOR -  A five minute interview with editor Hughes Winborne about working with Gabriele Muccino but also Will Smith and how the final scene was so difficult and emotional for him to cut.THE COMPOSER - A six minute featurette with an interview with Angelo Milli and creating music that would show the various layers of Will Smith's character.

How Gabriele knew Woody Harrelson and stayed with his family in Hawaii and gave him a role on the film.* Emily's Passion: The Art of the Printing Press - In the film, the character of Emily collects old vintage printing press.  In this nine minute segment, Mark Barbour, director and curator of the International Printing Museum in Carson, CA gives us a tour of the Internationa Printing Museum in Carson, CA and showing us certain press, especially those used in the film.* The Box Jellyfish: World's Deadliest Co-Star - A five minute featurette about jellyfish and how people stung by it have died or felt excruciating pain and how vinegar is used by life guards to prevent the stinging cells from clinging to the human body.* Deleted Scenes - Four short deleted scenes.  The only significant scene was Smith's character visiting a doctor and the doctor worried about Smith's character lying to the hospital.The Blu-ray disc release of ""SEVEN POUNDS"" also comes with a digital copy of the film.JUDGMENT CALL:I was truly moved by ""SEVEN POUNDS"".  Will Smith is just magnificent in this film and I have no doubt that people who watch this film will be in tears.  It's a powerful, inspiring and sad film but it's also a film that can be thought of as controversial.  I can't really go into the specifics without spoiling the film but Will Smith and his ability to showcase his acting ability in a role of a devastated man who has lived with torment and now wanting to give back and help others.Rosario Dawson is definitely no lightweight as Emily, a woman who has a bad heart and knows she doesn't have much time to live if she doesn't find a heart donor.  Dawson just owns this role and does a fantastic job.The storyline is quite moving but viewers can easily figure out of why Will Smith is doing what he is doing halfway before the end of the film.  It's just watching to see how he goes through this journey of a man in the dark, having to be back in the light but then knowing that for him, to change the life of others, he has to carry out his plan.The Blu-ray really brings out the different layers of Will Smith's character by showcasing color in various manners.  These transitions in color look absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray and and during the darker scenes, I don't recall seeing any artifacts or high noise levels.  So, this film does look good in High-Definition.Overall, ""SEVEN POUNDS"" is all about sacrifice and a character trying to redeem himself after a tragic incident in his life that has weighed tremendously in his heart.Despite it's lukewarm response by movie critics, personally, I felt ""SEVEN POUNDS"" was just powerful.  I was ultimately moved and despite the decisions that the character makes, it was a decision that was made in order to help people and change their lives for the best.""SEVEN POUNDS"" is a powerful, inspiring and but yet is also a heartbreaking and tragic film worth watching.

In a way, it is the ""Count of Monte Cristo"" in reverse.Will Smith, who has grown immeasurably as an actor, gives a powerful performance. He really seems like he is carrying the weight of the world upon his shoulders. Rosario Dawson is a great foil with her deep emotional acting and sincerity. All of the other character actors are great as well, providing essential support to the story.

The story is carried almost entirely by Will Smith, who brings another excellent performance to the screen. It takes very long for the plot to unravel and for the viewer to understand what the story is all about. Tediously slow the greater picture is revealed. The misdirection and ""beating about the bush"" goes on for quite a while. This may cause some people to get a little irritated. I know I did. However, understanding gradually dawned and it was at that moment that the film really got an impact that far outweighs seven pounds. It was also then that I understood --or at least thought I understood-- its mystical title. This is a film that you will definitely remember and that will stay with you for a while after leaving the movie theatre. I recommend it.

It proved that he is at least able to carry a movie without all of the ""whizz bangs and shoot-em up"" stuff. For a while I thought he would just lay back, cash in his millions, and go home saying, ""a job well done, and leave real acting to others. I thought this because, try as he might, his past attempts to launch a ""real"" acting career, have, at least in this reviewer's eyes, been failures ranging from ""utter"" to just plain ""abject.""At least in this movie, Will proved that he can hold an ""even grimace"" throughout the movie, whether the scene calls for it or not. That is at least some consolation for an actor who in the biopic called Ali, got the voice right but failed to get the fighter's punches and moves choreographed correctly: How does one striving to become a serious actor do that? (Will, how can I ever forgive you for that?) Now, he is at least on a progressive incline, however steep it may be, and for him it is very steep indeed. At this rate, a hundred years from now, he, along with Samuel L. Jackson, will win the academy awards.But all is not lost, for the rest of this movie showed some real sparks. It was a well put together story, properly casted, which is more than half the battle. And the supporting cast consisted of a couple of real actors. Both are prerequisites for ""Will Smith Movies"" if Will is to ever get his act (pun intended) together.

But I don't love narcissism masquaraded as virtue and that is what happens in this film.  Ben Thomas is an ultimate jerk--driven by guilt to do something for humanity who does so on his own superficial terms to where he gets to play judge and jury on who gets to benefit from his shame and guilt. And while what he does provides alleviation of pain and misery for others, the tactics deployed in unraveling Thomas' plight come from empty-headed self-absorbtion.What truly irks me is how Holywood is so out of touch with how to play the virtuous humanity of people--this is such a mechanistic piece of bombastic drek that I cannot emphasize enough that people should shy away from this film. If you want a good, meaningful lesson in the human condition, go watch LARS AND THE REAL GIRL--whose gifts unfold beautifully and you find yourself mysteriously moved by a ridiculous premise. SEVEN POUNDS relies on dirty tricks to fool you into weepy submission--for that, the director, the screenwriter and producers (including Smith himself...who seems to do more films determined to diminish his grace of late) earn your scorn. In fact, the notion of suicide to make amends is just flat out ridiculous.  There's nothing brave nor courageous about this film.I know people have said this was a moving film, but how can you say a film where the protagonist is an egotistical and shallow control freak with guilt issues makes for inspiration?Kudos to Rosario Dawson--a vision of lovliness who rises above the apparent lack of true compassion in this film--she proves that she's destined to be one of our world's leading actresses as she matures. She's the only actor who transcends the inept script--even managing to pull off some sympathy for the film's final two minutes, which has to be the worst cornball ending and a big kiss off to the audience.As for Smith, if he continues down this path (HANCOCK, HAPPYNESS and I AM LEGEND), we'll wonder why we ever thought so highly of him, much in the way we miss the old Tom Cruise.",1,Manipulation in Pounds,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",2009,2138,"['wanted', 'like', 'film', 'love', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'love', 'good', 'tear-jerker', 'love', 'good', 'mystery', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'narcissism', 'masquaraded', 'virtue', 'what', 'film', 'Ben', 'Thomas', 'ultimate', 'jerk', 'driven', 'guilt', 'do', 'something', 'humanity', 'who', 'so', 'own', 'superficial', 'terms', 'where', 'play', 'judge', 'jury', 'who', 'benefit', 'shame', 'guilt', 'what', 'alleviation', 'pain', 'misery', 'others', 'tactics', 'deployed', 'unraveling', 'Thomas', 'plight', 'come', 'empty-headed', 'self-absorbtion.What', 'truly', 'irks', 'how', 'Holywood', 'so', 'touch', 'how', 'play', 'virtuous', 'humanity', 'people', 'such', 'mechanistic', 'piece', 'bombastic', 'drek', 'can', 'not', 'emphasize', 'enough', 'people', 'should', 'shy', 'away', 'film', 'want', 'good', 'meaningful', 'lesson', 'human', 'condition', 'go', 'watch', 'LARS', 'THE', 'REAL', 'GIRL', 'gifts', 'unfold', 'beautifully', 'find', 'mysteriously', 'moved', 'ridiculous', 'premise', 'SEVEN', 'POUNDS', 'dirty', 'tricks', 'fool', 'weepy', 'submission', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'producers', 'including', 'Smith', 'who', 'do', 'more', 'films', 'determined', 'diminish', 'grace', 'late', 'earn', 'scorn', 'fact', 'notion', 'suicide', 'make', 'amends', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'ridiculous', 'nothing', 'brave', 'courageous', 'film.I', 'know', 'people', 'have', 'said', 'was', 'moving', 'film', 'how', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'where', 'protagonist', 'egotistical', 'shallow', 'control', 'freak', 'guilt', 'issues', 'inspiration', 'Kudos', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'vision', 'lovliness', 'who', 'apparent', 'lack', 'true', 'compassion', 'film', 'destined', 'be', 'one', 'world', 'leading', 'actresses', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'inept', 'script', 'even', 'managing', 'pull', 'off', 'sympathy', 'film', 'final', 'two', 'minutes', 'be', 'worst', 'cornball', 'ending', 'big', 'kiss', 'audience.As', 'Smith', 'down', 'path', 'HANCOCK', 'HAPPYNESS', 'AM', 'LEGEND', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'why', 'ever', 'thought', 'so', 'highly', 'much', 'way', 'miss', 'old', 'Tom', 'Cruise']",N/A

1230687,AMUP8DYE7EAN2,B001QERPAM,"mateo52 ""invisible man""","[1, 2]","For anyone who is familiar with the line from the Merchant of Venice, the only question that exists from the start of the film is why? At the start, we meet Will Smith's character in the middle of an emergency call to 911, to report his suicide attempt and from that point on his story is haphazardly unveiled in the effort to elicit an emotional response from the viewing audience but at least for this viewer, all I really felt was it was far past time for Mr. Ben Thomas, roving IRS agent, to get over himself.The visceral reactions of any individual to traumatic life events are difficult to predict however to look upon self destruction as redemptive regardless of the underlying motivations, is a philosophical position with which I cannot concur or support.  As we learn Smith's character has been both driven and successful in life but as a result of a momentary lapse in judgment, a set of events are placed in play resulting in a period of depression that he only sees one way out of, propelling him on a journey of inevitable self- sacrifice, to identify and assist seven deserving souls who struggle to maintain stability under variably challenging conditions.  Not to be confused with the doctrine of `pay it forward,' the sojourn of Thomas feels closer to an ill considered quest for salvation or sainthood, but in reality, entirely self-absorbed.Will Smith seems to be another advocate of the Box Office champion's template, a summertime action blockbuster followed by a holiday season drama or comedy. Unfortunately, this film lacks the realism and appeal of past dramatic turns like Ali or The Pursuit of Happyness, bordering on a fantasized and erroneously formulated ideal of good.  Rosario Dawson who plays the role of Emily Posa, a young woman in need of a heart transplant brings not only palpable chemistry with Smith to the screen but also suffuses the passion the movie so desperately needed. Woody Harrelson in another supporting role, tends to bring forth thoughts of a nice payday but little else.Ultimately, I felt like I dedicated at minimum one pound of flesh myself for staying until the inevitable end.",3,Every little bit REALLY hurts.,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,2135,"['anyone', 'who', 'familiar', 'line', 'Merchant', 'Venice', 'only', 'question', 'start', 'film', 'why', 'start', 'meet', 'Will', 'Smith', 'character', 'middle', 'emergency', 'call', '911', 'report', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'point', 'story', 'haphazardly', 'unveiled', 'effort', 'elicit', 'emotional', 'response', 'viewing', 'audience', 'least', 'viewer', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'was', 'far', 'past', 'time', 'Mr.', 'Ben', 'Thomas', 'roving', 'IRS', 'agent', 'get', 'himself.The', 'visceral', 'reactions', 'individual', 'traumatic', 'life', 'events', 'are', 'difficult', 'predict', 'however', 'look', 'self', 'destruction', 'redemptive', 'regardless', 'underlying', 'motivations', 'philosophical', 'position', 'can', 'not', 'concur', 'support', 'learn', 'Smith', 'character', 'been', 'driven', 'successful', 'life', 'result', 'momentary', 'lapse', 'judgment', 'set', 'events', 'are', 'placed', 'play', 'resulting', 'period', 'depression', 'only', 'one', 'way', 'propelling', 'journey', 'inevitable', 'self-', 'sacrifice', 'identify', 'assist', 'seven', 'deserving', 'souls', 'who', 'struggle', 'maintain', 'stability', 'variably', 'challenging', 'conditions', 'Not', 'be', 'confused', 'doctrine', 'pay', 'forward', 'sojourn', 'Thomas', 'feels', 'closer', 'ill', 'considered', 'quest', 'salvation', 'sainthood', 'reality', 'entirely', 'self-absorbed.Will', 'Smith', 'be', 'advocate', 'Box', 'Office', 'champion', 'template', 'summertime', 'action', 'blockbuster', 'followed', 'holiday', 'season', 'drama', 'comedy', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'realism', 'appeal', 'past', 'dramatic', 'turns', 'Ali', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'bordering', 'fantasized', 'erroneously', 'formulated', 'ideal', 'good', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'who', 'role', 'Emily', 'Posa', 'young', 'woman', 'need', 'heart', 'transplant', 'not', 'only', 'palpable', 'chemistry', 'Smith', 'screen', 'also', 'passion', 'movie', 'so', 'desperately', 'needed', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'supporting', 'role', 'bring', 'forth', 'thoughts', 'nice', 'payday', 'little', 'else.Ultimately', 'felt', 'dedicated', 'minimum', 'one', 'pound', 'flesh', 'staying', 'inevitable', 'end']",N/A

1230689,A36RS3ZMNE9JSQ,B001QERPAM,Negative Comments,"[10, 32]","This has the two things that I hate most about movies: 1) A movie so full of it itself that it abandons traditional story telling techniques and just defiantly exists on its own with no consideration for the viewer; 2) A plot so muddled that you don't even start to get an idea of what's going on until very late in the movie. I hate movies like that. There's no REASON for it.Story: Will Smith was in a car accident which caused the deaths of everyone involved, and so now he's guilt ridden and suicidal, and decides to donate organs, body parts, and houses to people to help them.Apparently all of this is supposed to be deeply impactful and emotional, and other stuff like that. I don't know if it was Will Smith's acting, or the writing of the story or what, but about the only emotion I felt was the one that made me shake my head several times during the movie. I guess the ending just had no value to me because all I kept thinking about was how we just came nearly two hours for THIS. Two hours of confusing, meandering, mysterious story telling all just to reach this point.Complaints:**I respect Will Smith, but there's one thing in his performances in dramatic roles that I don't care for, and that's that look he does when he looks like he's trying to suppress tears. Let me be clear, all his other faces are fine, his dramatic face is fine, his sad face is fine, his sympathetic face is fine, every face he makes related to the sad category is just fine. It's his TEAR-SUPPRESSING face that is completely out of the question. It just looks so forced. It's like he's consciously moving his face like that, you can almost see him making real-time decisions on which facial muscle to move next. He needs to tone that down a bit.**Well, speaking of faces, it was silly having Will Smith have that sad face the whole movie. I just explained that his sad face was OK, while his tear-suppressing face was not. This is still true, problem is, it's completely unrealistic to have him with the sad face the WHOLE MOVIE. At any given time, he looks like he could easily be led to tears. From the movie's perspective, how can ANYONE in his universe take him seriously? He literally acts like a mentally handicapped teenager who's on the verge of crying at any given time. Maybe we don't know people as sad or depressed as this, but I just can't imagine any adult with this kind of blatantly sad look affixed to their face permanently, no matter how depressed.**When his brother found him at the end, Will Smith was trying to convince him to please leave. He said, ""just go home, you have a beautiful family, go home and join them."" What a bad line. With the weight of the situation, do you think giving your panicked brother such a simple directive is going to get him off your back??**I hate the scene where Will Smith indignantly brings the dog into his motel room. They're portraying this scene as if a previously oppressed person is finally standing up and opposing the injustices done to him, but Will Smith is 100% wrong here.

""geek hipster""","[1, 1]","In the first minute of this film, we are introduced to Ben Thomas, an alleged IRS agent, living in a seedy motel, calling 911 for his own suicide.  Why is this man doing this, and where is he coming from?If you watch this movie looking for a mystery, or some heavy conflict, you'd probably be disappointed.  It's a meditation, more than anything.  It looks at the character of Ben Thomas rather dispassionately, in fact.. because he is completely closed off by trauma and guilt.  And that's what makes this such a fascinating character study.. after a 2 sentence voiceover, we only see what he does for the next 2 hours, the last 2 weeks of his life. There is alot of color palette work, signifying death (blue, the blue bathroom tile, the water tank) and life (yellow sunlight, Rosario Dawson dressed in yellow and gold) and the balance between the two.. the beach.  What this bluray lacks in 3D pop, it definitely makes up for in it's color scheme.Rosario Dawson's Emily is near impossible to not like, and the camera loves her, but it took me 3 viewings to really appreciate the most important character in this film is Ben's dead wife. The plot is not simply about atoning for a terrible mistake, but for returning to the woman he really loves, with a clean slate.  Now, that's NOT a catholic interpretation of the subject matter, but I think there is a difference between suicide (despair) and giving up your life (sacrifice to help others) that this film explores really well.Smith's Ben is not easy to LIKE, he's so consumed by his project that we only really 'see' him when he breaks character in his affection for Emily, and --- there is a big degree of emotional manipulation in the story, but this still remains a truly haunting work, with some really unconventional imagery, and a great deal of subtext to talk about, and think about.",5,"A Meditation on Love, Death & Sacrifice",1257465600,"11 6, 2009",2009,1846,"['first', 'minute', 'film', 'are', 'introduced', 'Ben', 'Thomas', 'alleged', 'IRS', 'agent', 'living', 'seedy', 'motel', 'calling', '911', 'own', 'suicide', 'Why', 'man', 'doing', 'where', 'coming', 'watch', 'movie', 'looking', 'mystery', 'heavy', 'conflict', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'meditation', 'more', 'anything', 'character', 'Ben', 'Thomas', 'rather', 'dispassionately', 'fact..', 'completely', 'closed', 'off', 'trauma', 'guilt', 'what', 'such', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study..', '2', 'sentence', 'voiceover', 'only', 'see', 'what', 'next', '2', 'hours', 'last', '2', 'weeks', 'life', 'alot', 'color', 'palette', 'work', 'signifying', 'death', 'blue', 'blue', 'bathroom', 'tile', 'water', 'tank', 'life', 'yellow', 'sunlight', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'dressed', 'yellow', 'gold', 'balance', 'two..', 'beach', 'What', 'bluray', '3D', 'pop', 'definitely', 'up', 'color', 'scheme.Rosario', 'Dawson', 'Emily', 'near', 'impossible', 'not', 'like', 'camera', 'took', '3', 'viewings', 'really', 'appreciate', 'most', 'important', 'character', 'film', 'Ben', 'dead', 'wife', 'plot', 'not', 'simply', 'atoning', 'terrible', 'mistake', 'returning', 'woman', 'really', 'clean', 'slate', 'Now', 'NOT', 'catholic', 'interpretation', 'subject', 'matter', 'think', 'difference', 'suicide', 'despair', 'giving', 'up', 'life', 'sacrifice', 'help', 'others', 'film', 'really', 'well.Smith', 'Ben', 'not', 'easy', 'LIKE', 'so', 'consumed', 'project', 'only', 'really', ""'see"", 'when', 'character', 'affection', 'Emily', 'big', 'degree', 'emotional', 'manipulation', 'story', 'still', 'truly', 'haunting', 'work', 'really', 'unconventional', 'imagery', 'great', 'deal', 'subtext', 'talk', 'think']",N/A

In fact it shows how good the film is that you are left affected despite guessing the ending.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[2, 3]","You need to stick with it but eventually it starts to gelI watched this DVD without knowing ANYTHING about it except that Will Smith was the star and that he plays an IRS agent. (I'm still not sure about the title.) After the first 40 minutes I was still thinking that this was an adventure/crime story which seemed to be going nowhere and the timer on my DVD player said it still had almost 90 more minutes to go. I almost gave up, but continued to watch. Soon things started to be revealed and new characters appeared. Next we got into a love story with romantic soundtrack and the requisite (today) lovemaking scene. It wasn't gelling for me, but had some emotional moments (of course, accompanied by ""emotional music"".) Finally the full - well, almost full, plot was revealed. And I felt the time spent watching Mr. Smith and Ms. Dawson were worth watching.I won't re-tread comments made by others and don't want to reveal any of the plot twists - that's for others to discover - but it seemed to me that important scenes were cut which would have explained some odd moments. (What is going on with the Aeronautics company scene? Where did Dan meet ""Ben""?). It was just too choppy for me. I'd give the film alone 3 stars.Now the DVD has bonus features - but they are really stretching the subject here. There is a 6 minute documentary on the box jellyfish (at least the fish in the film didn't get an onscreen credit &lt;g>. Want to know the history of the printing press? There's a feature on that too! So, why not one on the history of the Internal Revenue Service? (THAT would be interesting). There is the standard, by now, feature with comments by the stars, write, producer and composer and - the longest - by the casting director. Of course, these are filled with MANY scenes from the film you have already watched.

The story and the direction it's headed can be guessed earlier on, though the film is careful not to ever succumb to over-predictability.  Director Gabriele Muccino has again crafted an emotionally engaging work of love, guilt, sacrifice, and retribution, and Will Smith has delivered another triumphantly powerful performance.  Mixing an intricate drama with delicate romance and a compelling plan for redemption, Seven Pounds could easily be the feel-good movie of the year if it wasn't so depressing in its approach to salvation.Tormented by his past, IRS agent Ben Thomas (Will Smith) sets out on a mission of redemption to drastically change the lives of seven strangers.  But as his plans are slowly put into motion, he finds himself falling for the beautiful Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson), a young woman whose heart condition finds her prematurely facing the fragility of life, and in turn Ben must come to terms with his own mortality and his dire plan for retribution.Although the idea behind Seven Pounds has Shakespearean references (see The Merchant of Venice), seven is too high a number for a two hour film. It calls for more characters, few of which receive adequate screen time (or perhaps purposefully aids in the confusion) and lessens the realism of the plot. The secret behind the film is so important that the trailers, teasers, poster artwork and more are all shrouded with mystery - and as the film unravels, the audience is kept in the dark for as long as possible. It's a novel idea, but ultimately faces two possible routes to failure: the viewer will get irritated at being kept out of the loop for so long, or the conclusion (which suffers from absurdity under hindsight scrutiny) won't live up to the anticipation. What saves the whole thing is Will Smith, who remains just interesting enough that the mind-boggling narrative progression is forgivable.Rejoining director Gabriele Muccino (The Pursuit of Happyness) for another serious drama role is an appropriate choice for Smith; during the last few years he's tried his luck with almost every genre and has had great success, but his most impressive work comes from dramatic realism. The script isn't all that clever, but Smith is able to add enough wonderment to Ben that anticipation (and maybe impatience) builds. Rosario Dawson also delivers one of her finer performances, while the remaining supporting characters add little to the intensity of Smith's role. The majority of his films lie solely on his ability to carry the plot, and Seven Pounds more than any before it, requires that audiences enjoy Smith's onscreen bravura.- The Massie Twins",4,Seven Pounds Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1229558400,"12 18, 2008",2008,2811,"['Seven', 'Pounds', 'tactic', 'misdirection', 'surprise', 'little', 'confusion', 'film', 'jumps', 'time', 'waits', 'provide', 'explanation', 'almost', 'halfway', 'story', 'direction', 'headed', 'can', 'be', 'guessed', 'earlier', 'film', 'careful', 'not', 'ever', 'succumb', 'over-predictability', 'Director', 'Gabriele', 'Muccino', 'again', 'crafted', 'emotionally', 'engaging', 'work', 'love', 'guilt', 'sacrifice', 'retribution', 'Will', 'Smith', 'delivered', 'triumphantly', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Mixing', 'intricate', 'drama', 'delicate', 'romance', 'compelling', 'plan', 'redemption', 'Seven', 'Pounds', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'year', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'depressing', 'approach', 'salvation.Tormented', 'past', 'IRS', 'agent', 'Ben', 'Thomas', 'Will', 'Smith', 'out', 'mission', 'redemption', 'drastically', 'change', 'lives', 'seven', 'strangers', 'plans', 'are', 'slowly', 'put', 'motion', 'falling', 'beautiful', 'Emily', 'Posa', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'young', 'woman', 'heart', 'condition', 'prematurely', 'facing', 'fragility', 'life', 'turn', 'Ben', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'own', 'mortality', 'dire', 'plan', 'idea', 'Seven', 'Pounds', 'Shakespearean', 'references', 'see', 'Merchant', 'Venice', 'seven', 'too', 'high', 'number', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'more', 'characters', 'few', 'receive', 'adequate', 'screen', 'time', 'perhaps', 'purposefully', 'aids', 'confusion', 'realism', 'plot', 'secret', 'film', 'so', 'important', 'trailers', 'teasers', 'poster', 'artwork', 'more', 'are', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'film', 'unravels', 'audience', 'kept', 'dark', 'as', 'long', 'possible', 'novel', 'idea', 'ultimately', 'two', 'possible', 'routes', 'failure', 'viewer', 'will', 'get', 'irritated', 'being', 'kept', 'loop', 'so', 'long', 'conclusion', 'absurdity', 'hindsight', 'scrutiny', 'wo', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'anticipation', 'What', 'whole', 'thing', 'Will', 'Smith', 'who', 'just', 'interesting', 'enough', 'mind-boggling', 'narrative', 'progression', 'forgivable.Rejoining', 'director', 'Gabriele', 'Muccino', 'Pursuit', 'Happyness', 'serious', 'drama', 'role', 'appropriate', 'choice', 'Smith', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'tried', 'luck', 'almost', 'genre', 'had', 'great', 'success', 'most', 'impressive', 'work', 'dramatic', 'realism', 'script', ""n't"", 'clever', 'Smith', 'able', 'add', 'enough', 'wonderment', 'Ben', 'anticipation', 'maybe', 'impatience', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'also', 'one', 'finer', 'performances', 'remaining', 'supporting', 'characters', 'add', 'little', 'intensity', 'Smith', 'role', 'majority', 'films', 'lie', 'solely', 'ability', 'carry', 'plot', 'Seven', 'Pounds', 'more', 'audiences', 'enjoy', 'Smith', 'onscreen', 'bravura.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

I know the reviews but unless you truly put yourself in Ben's (Will Smith) shoes, or if you truly know what it's like to hate your life........to be willing to give it up for someone else who can live it better, I can understand why you wouldn't like this movie or rate it low. I've never had such tragedies befall me as the ones that Ben in Seven Pounds experienced but I know the drive behind his actions. It wasn't just redemption. It was knowing that there were good people that were dying while he, the person he felt doesn't deserve to live, lives and was the cause of death for some. It takes an extremely strong person to live thru such tragedies, guilt, shame, loss and come out a person that sets it all aside to do good despite it all. To put others first. To hate oneself but feel compassion, sympathy, love towards others and put ones self the last. To notice others pain no matter how great yours is, truly is admirable and that affected me most. (It was the first part of the movie that showed this)Usually when one is depressed one only thinks of self. Depression is a completely mind consuming thing. Blocks out others and is a thief of any motivation to do any thing. To live. So to see someone over come that and do GOOD and RIGHT things in life is just awe inspiring. Powerful! I'm a healthy, young person yet how much thought do I give to others pain? How much thought do I give to help others and make there life better? Would I be willing to donate my organs and feel discomfort and pain thru the healing? Would I be willing to give my home to one that has none? Would I shelter those that need sheltering from the storms of life? Would I stand up for what's right no matter the storm against me? That is what made me think about. In the modern society that we live in selfishness and the big ME is pushed upon us everywhere. But is it right? It's like a beautifully painted canves, step past it and there's nothing there.We are human and we all crave love. Thing is, love is all about feeling compassion, putting others first before oneself, sacrifice, hope....etc. It was love that drove this entire movie because it was only when he started falling in love again that a spark of life was borne. There was hope for a new life. I don't think Ben had ever thought it was possible to ever be happy in life again but thru the new love he found he found out that it was possible. Thing is, the one he fell in love with needed him to die to live. What would you have done if you had the chance to let live the person you loved most? Ben didn't want to die in the end that was why he was so tormented when he called in his suiside at the start of the movie but he chose to let live the one that brought life back to his eyes and love back to his heart.That is why I love this movie and why I am going to buy it on DVD and see it over and over again because it's well made, acted, and very intelligently written.
