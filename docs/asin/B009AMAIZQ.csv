1590721,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B009AMAIZQ,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","From the writers/directors Vincent Paronnaud and Marjane Satrapi of ""Persepolis"" comes the French drama ""Chicken with Plums"".Based on the graphic novel ""Poulet aux prunes"" by Satrapi, the film premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival back in September 2011.  And now, the film will be released by Sony Pictures Classics in Feb. 2013.""Chicken with Plums"" is set in Tehran during the '50s and revolves around a man named Nasser-Ali Khan (portrayed by Mathieu Amalric).  A renowned concert violinist, things have not been the same for Nasser since his beloved violin was broken, and now he has tried so many violins from a variety of stores, he's not achieving the sound that he wants.One day, after purchasing a violin, he encounters a woman named and excited, he asks her if she is Irane (portrayed by Golshifteh Farahani) and asks her if she remembers him, she answers that she doesn't.We see a bit about Nasser's current life.  He is married to a woman named Frainguisse (portrayed by Maria de Medeiros) with two children and while his wife works, he is often criticized by her for being unemployed and not taking responsibility as a husband and father.While trying to play a stradivarius violin that he just purchased, it's just not the same.  So, he pulls out his beloved, broken violin which is way beyond repair.His music is his life and because he is unable to produce the music that he wants, he decides that he will die.Fast forward eight days later and his loved ones and his friends attend his funeral.And the film then takes us day by day of how Nasser tries to die.  But most importantly how his beloved violin was broken, but most importantly, how Nasser the musician and the individual, became a broken man.And it begins of how the young Nasser Ali, a student in Shiraz, began dating the beautiful Irane.  Two people who fell in love but a love that was not able to overcome a major obstacle.""Chicken with Plums"" is a beautiful love story about life's regrets and a film with emotion and heartbreak.VIDEO, AUDIO AND SUBTITLES:""Chicken with Plums"" is presented in 2:35:1 anamorphic widescreen and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  While the film was released on Blu-ray in France, in the U.S., only on DVD.  Picture quality for the most part is good, as one can expect on DVD.  While the audio is primarily dialogue-driven, until you get to the second half and when you hear the LFE kick during a splitting of a rock and hear Nasser-Ali playing his violin, dialogue and music sound crisp and clear.  Sure, I would have loved to watch this film in HD but for the most part, most should be pleased with the overall visual and audio presentation on DVD.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Chicken with Plums"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Co-Director/Co-writers Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud.  The commentary is in English and French but has optional commentary subtitles if needed.Tribeca Q&A; - (15:07) Featuring a Tribeca Film Festival Q&A; with Co-Director/Co-writers Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud.Theatrical Trailer - (1:55) The original theatrical trailer for ""Poulet aux prunes"" (Chicken with Plums).JUDGMENT CALL:Sometimes you encounter a film that starts off one way in terms of tone and style but then takes a 180 and becomes a different film altogether.Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud's ""Chicken with Plums"" is a poetic film, a beautiful film that I found quite fascinating.  The first half of the film, the film feels like comedy and appears like a banal film about a man disenchanted with his life and not happy with his family.For the first half of the film, you wonder to yourself of what is wrong with this guy.  Why does he seem so cold and bitter?  Why is he unable to play any other violin and how did his original beloved violin break?As the film starts off showcasing Nasser-Ali embracing death and is greeted by death and the Angel of Death, Azrael (portrayed by Edouard Baer) in his dreams, part of me was trying to figure this film out and wondering if  ""is this going to be a comedic version of Ingmar Bergman's `Seventh Seal'?"".So, while the first half of the film tries to show the viewer how Nasser-Ali is ready to die, while his kids hope he doesn't, by the final half hour of the film,the tone of the film changes.The film leaves its comedic roots to show us why Nasser-Ali is miserable and this is where the film becomes artistic, poetic and ultimately heartbreaking.We find out that a younger Nasser-Ali was training to become a violinist, but while he was younger, he met the beautiful Irane.  The two enjoyed silent film, the two enjoyed each other's company and the two fell in love.  It's as if two individuals have discovered their soul mate and they felt they belonged together.But I'm not going to spoil this film.  The relationship is the beginning of the magic but it's the way the relationship is presented and what led to the breakup and the events that followed for the next 20-years is what is was amazing that you simply realize that writer and co-director Marjane Satrapi was preparing the viewer to go from dark comedy to a romantic drama  that will captivate you.Because of its structure, some may feel that how the film is told for its first hour and its transition for the final half hour to be unbalanced,  looked at the two different style of storytelling to be rather interesting and unique when trying to do something different and not so banal as many other films tend to go that direction.  Try something different and that is what Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud are doing and I applaud the two for creating the shift in tonality and and overall style.The acting by Mathieu Amalric and Golshifteh Farahani are fantastic.  Amalric does a wonderful job in portraying different sides of Nasser-Ali Khan and Farahani did a fantastic job in bringing the more emotional and sentimental component to the film.As for the DVD, picture quality and audio quality is as good as one can expect from a DVD release.  You get an audio commentary and a Q&A; from Tribeca that is included and for the most part, both were fascinating to listen to and watch.Overall, ""Chicken with Plums"" is a fascinating film that is well-crafted but not entirely perfect, depending on the viewer in how they accept the two halves of the film which are presented in a different style. But I was absolutely captivated by this film by the ending credits and felt I experienced something quite delightfully entertaining and different.""Chicken with Plums"" is a beautiful love story about life's regrets and a film with emotion and heartbreak.

1590722,A2T2A4YSJ9YWV4,B009AMAIZQ,Gerard D. Launay,"[0, 0]","We hear this expression often enough, but is it true?  This movie explores that possibility - or reality -  or fantasy - in the life of a troubled man living in Persia - Nasser Ali Khan.Let's be clear, this fellow is not a particularly nice person.  He does not support his kids, emotionally or financially. If that is not enough, he is openly vicious to his wife, a suffering woman who tries her best to love him.  He dreams of making beautiful music, but does not have an instrument to play. And yet, there is more to the man...and his history.  Once, he was a great musician, whose every note vibrated with meaning. What went wrong?This film uses every technique in film - animation, live action, voice over, visits by saints or demons, forward narration, back narration, to give a full picture of, what shall I say - a life, a love, a desire to offer art to the world.  It is a beautifully looking picture.In my mind, it is an extraordinarily inventive movie. But it can be painful to watch because the subject is so hard to take. Most of the film involves the husband's decision to give up on life - and it takes him eight days to slide to oblivion. He just stops living...goes to bed, and refuses drink, food, advice, or comfort.I was terribly impressed that a filmmaker would even endeavor to make a movie on such a difficult topic.

I went to see it right away this past weekend, as I doubt this will be playing a long time in the theatre.""Chicken With Plums"" (2011 release from France; 90 min.) is based on the graphic novel of the same name. It brings the story of violinist Nasser Ali, set in Tehran in 1958. It takes a while to figure out what exactly is happening but eventually a picture emerges: Nasser Ali, upset with things in life (we will later in the movie learn what exactly), has decided to die. After considering his options (all of which he finds too gruesome), he simply retires to his room, inviting the Angel of Death to come and take him. But the Angel of Death apparently is busy with other things, and as the days go by, Nasser Ali reflects on his life, and we learn of his erstwhile true love, a woman named Irane.To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all turns out. Several comments: not surprisingly, given its origins in a graphic novel, the visuals in the movie play a huge role, and the movie is eye candy from the start to the finish. Second, the acting performances in the movie are at a very high level, check out of course Mathieu Amalric in the lead role as Nasser Ali, but also noteworthy is Isabella Rossellini in a small but choice role as Nasser Ali's mother. Last, I want to mention the co-directors of the movie, Vincent Paronnaud and Marjane Satrapi (the latter being the author of the novel), who recreate the scenery and atmosphere of the laste 50s Tehran with a bittersweet, almost nostalgic sense (the same team also brought us the excellent ""Persepolis"" some 4-5 years ago, with that same sense of bittersweet nostalgia).

1590727,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B009AMAIZQ,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[9, 9]","This is a review of the DVD version of the film:This is a fine example of the difference between well-made French films as most US films, including small ""independent films"". The Director makes you think and entertains you at the same time.  When I saw that this film was from the same filmmakers as Persepolis - the wonderful animated graphic novel - I wanted to see it. I wasn't expecting as much live action as is here but there is animation included this time as well. Both were based on graphic novels by Marjane  Satrapi  and co-directed by her and Vincent Paronnaud. The plot sounds boring. A violinist's wife breaks his violin and he decides he wants to die. So he sits in his room and waits for the Angel of Death to come. And he waits for days. That's I'll I'm telling you. As my fellow reviewer Paul Allaer has written in his review, to tell you more will spoil the fun. But if you like to put yourself in the hands of creative French filmmakers you will enjoy the ""tale"" of the violinist Nassar-Ali (the story takes place in Tehran).I won't repeat much of what Paul Allaer said, but I hope I can expand on the info for the DVD version.First off, Sony Classics has made it easy to read the subtitles. They are in BRIGHT YELLOW below the screen image. This gives it easy contrast and does not cover the picture. Lately I've been frustrated by DVDs and Blu-rays with subtitles in small white print - often when scenes have snow or a white background. I wish more companies would use yellow or green for the subtitles.The 91-minute film is supplemented by a full length commentary by the filmmakers as well as a 15-minute Q&A; session from the Tribeca Film Festival Premiere.  It's interesting.Don't look to deep for meaning in the film's title. You'll learn it during the film but it's not whatever you think it means. Just another surprise in a fascinating - though I dare not say ""happy"" - film.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Offbeat French film from creators of Persepolis Only less animation.,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",2013,1997,"['review', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'fine', 'example', 'difference', 'well-made', 'French', 'films', 'most', 'US', 'films', 'including', 'small', 'independent', 'films', 'Director', 'think', 'same', 'time', 'When', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'same', 'filmmakers', 'Persepolis', 'wonderful', 'animated', 'graphic', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'as', 'much', 'live', 'action', 'here', 'animation', 'included', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'based', 'graphic', 'novels', 'Marjane', 'Satrapi', 'co-directed', 'Vincent', 'Paronnaud', 'plot', 'boring', 'violinist', 'wife', 'violin', 'die', 'room', 'waits', 'Angel', 'Death', 'come', 'days', ""'ll"", ""'m"", 'telling', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'Paul', 'Allaer', 'written', 'review', 'tell', 'more', 'will', 'spoil', 'fun', 'like', 'put', 'hands', 'creative', 'French', 'filmmakers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'tale', 'violinist', 'Nassar-Ali', 'story', 'place', 'Tehran', '.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'much', 'what', 'Paul', 'Allaer', 'said', 'hope', 'can', 'expand', 'info', 'DVD', 'version.First', 'off', 'Sony', 'Classics', 'made', 'easy', 'read', 'subtitles', 'are', 'BRIGHT', 'YELLOW', 'screen', 'image', 'easy', 'contrast', 'not', 'cover', 'picture', 'Lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'frustrated', 'DVDs', 'Blu-rays', 'subtitles', 'small', 'white', 'print', 'often', 'when', 'scenes', 'have', 'snow', 'white', 'background', 'wish', 'more', 'companies', 'would', 'use', 'yellow', 'green', 'subtitles.The', '91-minute', 'film', 'supplemented', 'full', 'length', 'commentary', 'filmmakers', 'as', 'well', '15-minute', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'Tribeca', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Premiere', 'interesting.Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'deep', 'meaning', 'film', 'title', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'film', 'not', 'think', 'Just', 'surprise', 'fascinating', 'dare', 'not', 'say', 'happy', 'film.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Chicken with Plums
