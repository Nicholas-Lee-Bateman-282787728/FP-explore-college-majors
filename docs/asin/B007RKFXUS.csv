1537104,A2T049UQONS0OY,B007RKFXUS,Larry VanDeSande,"[0, 0]","Jill and Karen Sprecher, who co-wrote a dozen episodes of HBO's silly, laughable parody of Mormons, Big Love, here create their own paean to the Coen brothers'Fargo, doing just about everything possible to ensure viewers who've seen it know this is Fargo 2. Among the plot devices and directorial contrivances the Sprechers borrowed from the Coens for this film include:-- Location. While Fargo took place in North Dakota and Minnesota, Thin Ice takes place in Wisconsin.-- Weather. Both films had actors complaining about cold, snowy winter weather.-- Plot contrivances. Fargo had the killer doing away with someone in long-term parking, claiming he was taking a trip to Florida. In Thin Ice, one of the cast members takes a trip.-- Lack of integrity. In Fargo, the leading man was a car salesman in debt. In Thin Ice, the leading man is an insurance salesman in debt. Both try to skirt the law as a way to get out of debt.There are many more obvious similarities from the tone of the production to the slow intial build-up to the series of misadventures that turns an insurance salesman's dilemma about thievery into a free-for-all wacky mystery-black comedy.Had the Coen brothers never created Fargo, Thin Ice would probably have succeeded. It has a strong cast with Greg Kinnear in the lead role and Alan Arkin playing the object of his illegal ardor. Billy Crudup is pretty good as a nincompoop home security salesman playing essentially the same part Peter Stormare played in Fargo.The movie is interesting from the opening scene, also, and builds well for about 75 minutes to quite a climax. However, the final five minutes of Thin Ice is a failure as the writers and director simply try to jam too much plot twist into too small a time frame, giving viewers no ability to absorb all the changes in such a brief time frame. This lack of subtlety and planning is the downfall of many a good film -- the failure to know how to close out a good thing.If you're in the mood for a mystery of the Fargo ilk, Thin Ice will probably fit the bill. It's an interesting, sometimes involving, dark comedy of errors that pile up and become something quite different at the end. Had the denouement been handled better, this could have been a much better film. As it is, it joins the throng of copies of great films destined to be forgotten on the scrap pile of Hollywood history.",3,Fairly interesting Coen brothers copy let down by confusing ending,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,2372,"['Jill', 'Karen', 'Sprecher', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'HBO', 'silly', 'laughable', 'parody', 'Mormons', 'Big', 'Love', 'here', 'create', 'own', 'paean', 'Coen', ""brothers'Fargo"", 'doing', 'just', 'everything', 'possible', 'ensure', 'viewers', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'know', 'Fargo', '2', 'plot', 'devices', 'directorial', 'contrivances', 'Sprechers', 'borrowed', 'Coens', 'film', 'include', 'Location', 'Fargo', 'took', 'place', 'North', 'Dakota', 'Minnesota', 'Thin', 'Ice', 'place', 'Wisconsin.', 'Weather', 'Both', 'films', 'had', 'actors', 'complaining', 'cold', 'snowy', 'winter', 'weather.', 'Plot', 'contrivances', 'Fargo', 'had', 'killer', 'doing', 'away', 'someone', 'long-term', 'parking', 'claiming', 'was', 'taking', 'trip', 'Florida', 'Thin', 'Ice', 'one', 'cast', 'members', 'trip.', 'Lack', 'integrity', 'Fargo', 'leading', 'man', 'was', 'car', 'salesman', 'debt', 'Thin', 'Ice', 'leading', 'man', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'debt', 'try', 'skirt', 'law', 'way', 'get', 'are', 'many', 'more', 'obvious', 'similarities', 'tone', 'production', 'slow', 'intial', 'build-up', 'series', 'misadventures', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'dilemma', 'thievery', 'free-for-all', 'wacky', 'mystery-black', 'comedy.Had', 'Coen', 'brothers', 'never', 'created', 'Fargo', 'Thin', 'Ice', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'succeeded', 'strong', 'cast', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'lead', 'role', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'playing', 'object', 'illegal', 'ardor', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'pretty', 'good', 'nincompoop', 'home', 'security', 'salesman', 'playing', 'essentially', 'same', 'part', 'Peter', 'Stormare', 'played', 'Fargo.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'opening', 'scene', 'also', 'builds', 'well', 'about', '75', 'minutes', 'quite', 'climax', 'However', 'final', 'five', 'minutes', 'Thin', 'Ice', 'failure', 'writers', 'director', 'simply', 'try', 'jam', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'twist', 'too', 'small', 'time', 'frame', 'giving', 'viewers', 'ability', 'absorb', 'changes', 'such', 'brief', 'time', 'frame', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'planning', 'downfall', 'many', 'good', 'film', 'failure', 'know', 'how', 'close', 'out', 'good', 'thing.If', ""'re"", 'mood', 'mystery', 'Fargo', 'ilk', 'Thin', 'Ice', 'will', 'probably', 'fit', 'bill', 'interesting', 'sometimes', 'involving', 'dark', 'comedy', 'errors', 'pile', 'up', 'become', 'something', 'quite', 'different', 'end', 'Had', 'denouement', 'been', 'handled', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'throng', 'copies', 'great', 'films', 'destined', 'be', 'forgotten', 'scrap', 'pile', 'Hollywood', 'history']",Thin Ice

1537108,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B007RKFXUS,Paul Allaer,"[2, 4]","""Thin Ice"" (94 min.) brings the story of Mickey Prohaska (played by Greg Kinnear), an everyday, ordinary Wisconsin insurance agent who is down on his luck. His marriage is falling apart, his business is not doing well. At an insurance conference, Prohaska hires on an impulse Bob Egan, a young ""go-getter"" insurance guy, to help the business improve. Indeed, the guy almost immediately finds a hot prospect, some old farmer who needs home insurance. Smelling an opportunity, Prohaska essentially takes over from Egan to reel in the old man. Prohaska befriends the old man and discovers the old man has an old viola that may be worth $25-30,000. Prohaska plots to find a way to get the viola, and then the problems start.What I described above covers maybe the first 15-20 min. of the movie and I intentionally do not want to give anything further away, as that would really spoil the joy of watching this movie. But I will say that the ending will surprise you. Sure, the movie reminds in particular of ""Fargo"", another film noir set in the all-out white of winter in one of the northern US states. But it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of watching this movie. Apart from the plot, the movie features plenty of great performances, none more so than Greag Kinnear as your everyday insurance guy who finds himself facing situations he never was prepared for, and also Alan Arkin, now 77 years and still going as if he is 27, playing the old farmer. Kudos also to Billy Crudup as the ""crazy"" security guy, and last but not least Lea Thompson in a small role as the wife of Greg Kinnear.A final note: the movie is set in Kenosha, WI (featured prominently on the movie poster), and the landscape plays a big role in the movie. Ironically, not a single scene was actually filmed in Wisconsin, as the entire movie was shot in Minnesota.

This imitation, down to the views of frozen lakes, cutting up of a body, and music that sounds like it's off the Fargo soundtrack, does not come close.I will give Kinnear credit. I think he's underrated as an actor. However, I believe he studied William Macy's Fargo mannerisms and speech patterns and tried to copy them.

His main problem is that he lacks integrity. This gets him in trouble as ""you can't cheat an honest man."" His wife (Lea Thompson) has given him the boot. Mickey has a scheme to rob an unsuspecting retired farmer (Alan Arkin) of a valuable violin he has laying around the house. Unfortunately Mickey needs the help of an unscrupulous psychotic home alarm installer (Billy Crudup) to pull the caper off. Things don't go as planned...One of the problems of this film is that it has similarities to ""Fargo."" I kept making comparisons in my mind and discovered Greg Kinnear is no William H. Macy; Billy Crudup is no Steve Buscemi. In spite of that, the film is worth watching for its own merits. The plot starts out plausible and slowly inches its way toward the bizarre. The film made clever use of dialouge and the violin soundtrack. The film is better if you can watch it without thinking about ""Fargo.""

After finding out that a new client of his has a rare violin worth over $25,000 he thinks his problems are solved. When he finally finds a way to get it and sell it an unstable locksmith (Crudup) shows up and changes everything. This is a good movie but really could have been better. This is kind of a mix between ""Ice Harvest"" and ""Fargo"" but not quite as good as those. I have thought that Greg Kinnear is one of the most underrated actors and this is another fine performance. The only problem is that the entire movie seemed a little flat and was really lacking excitement. I'm not saying that this not a good movie, it is worth watching and I enjoyed it but it was missing something. The thing that really helped the movie was the end. I really liked the twist and that made the movie better then it could have been. Overall, a flat movie with good acting that is saved by the ending. I give it a B.",3,"A lot like ""Ice Harvest"" meets ""Fargo"". A little flat but good performances and saved by the twist ending.
