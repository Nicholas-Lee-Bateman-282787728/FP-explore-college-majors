Bruce Willis, Kim Basinger, and John Larroqette do a fine job in this comedy. Blake Edwards directs this night of comic craziness that evolves running jokes, pratfalls, and more. Most of the movie is centered around one nights activities as Willis and Basinger go out on a blind date. If Basinger being pursued by a lovestruck Larroquette isn't enough, Basinger goes crazy after having a few drinks and totally wrecks Willis's life by disrupting his bosses party. Not to be outdone Willis decides to return the favor at Basinger's friends party. It doesn't end there but suffice it to say this is an enjoyable romantic comedy and worth at least a rental.

Since then I had seen it at Blockbuster and picked it up for the heck of it. I forgot how funny this movie was. And the most overlooked performance has to be by the late Phil Hartman (Ted Davis). What a comic he was! He had joined SNL in 1986 so I'm guessing this was one of his first movies after joining the show. Bruce Willis (Walter Davis) & Kim Basinger (Nadia Gates) do an equally good job of acting like a couple who are smitten with each other (when they aren't drunk, that is.) Adding to the laughs is Stephanie Faracy (The Great Outdoors) as Susie Davis, Walter's sister-in-law, John Larroquette (of Night Court) as Nadia's ex-crazed boyfriend David Bedford, and William Daniels (Boy Meets World) as Judge Harold Bedford, David's father.

He has made some bombs (any Pink Panther movie after Peter Sellers died, for example), yet Blind Date, as far as it is from being as funny as Sellers' Pink Panther movies, The Party (also with Sellers), Breakfast at Tiffany's, and so on, is an entertaining movie and has many clever moments.The plot, anyway, concerns workaholic Walter (Bruce Willis, pre-DIE HARD and very funny), who is bucking for a promotion and soon finds he needs a date for a dinner with his boss and a Japanese client they are representing. His brother-in-law (the always reliable late Phil Hartman)recommends Nadia (Kim Basinger), who is a sweet girl, until you get her drunk. Pish posh, says Walter, and down the hatch goes the champagne. Soon she is wrecking the dinner party, getting Walter fired, getting his car destroyed, and ultimately getting him arrested, mostly thanks to her psychotic ex-boyfriend David (John Larroquette, basically reprising his STRIPES character and doing a fine job of it). From there Walter has to crash David and Nadia's wedding (long story), but not before some sneaking around David's parents' mansion (which Edwards can direct like no one else).So slapstick? Check. Romance? Check. Bad '80s music? ...Sigh, check. Yeah, you'd think combining the two things he does best (pratfalls and romance) would make a masterpiece, but his fine eye for what's funny and Dale Launer's (also behind My Cousin Vinny, Ruthless People, and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, three admittedly better movies) witty script make a funny movie to watch on a boring night.

I just feel weird giving Blind Dare 4 stars because, even though it's great, it does contain a highly distressing 'disco' scene that will make you cringe.Walter Davis (Bruce Willis in his first movie) is a stressed workaholic who must bring a date to a business dinner to impress a Japanese client. In desperation his brings his sister-in-laws cousin Nadia (a brunette, and prettier Kim Basinger) who is very cute, but has a drink problem. Despite warnings not to get her drunk, Walter buys her champagne and, like some sort of human mogwai, she transforms into a crazed party animal. Things go very bad for Walter as Nadia proceeds to wreck his life. Not only that, but her totally mad ex-boyfriend David (John Larroquette) is stalking them at every turn. William Daniels (the voice of KITT from Knight Boat) even has a funny role as a disgruntled judge and the late (great) Phil Hartman plays Walter's brother.Filmmaking legend Blake Edwards (The Pink Panther, Breakfast at Tiffany's) is the man behind the camera. He brings a lot of class and experience to what could have been a generic romantic comedy. His widescreen compositions and long, moving camera takes add a touch of sophistication, it's a shame it just had to end up being so 80's.There are loads of hilarious moments and I suggest you pick it up whenever you see it.

It is such a funny, fun and uplifting story that will be sure to warm anyone's (beating) heart. This is Bruce's first big movie and it's almost a prelude to ""Die Hard"" because it was also a huge box office success and also because there was so much action and adventure and funny catchphrases.The movie starts out with Walter telling his brother, Ted (Phil Hartman, may he rest in peace) that he needs a date for an exclusive business affair. After being told not to give Nadia any alcohol Walter's date is made. One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Walter sees Nadia for the first time. It was love at first sight and words did not need to be said to express any of the emotions conveyed in the picture.After getting a little tipsy, Walter and Nadia make a grand entrance at a snobbish restaurant where all of the bigwigs of Walter's job are at. Walter soon finds out that alcohol turns Nadia into a gremlin... I love the part with Nadia and that jackass waiter. The slapstick was hysterical and so over-the-top. Kim Basinger was such a nutty girl. It was absolutely hysterical when she went up to the Japanese executive's wife and knocked the wig off her head. Then Nadia runs after her into the ladies room and although she doesn't speak English she understands what community property means. It doesn't get better than that.The rest of the majority of the bulk of the movie is spent trying to get Nadia home (she is between homes, doesn't know where she is going and is as drunk as a goose). Walter also has to deal with Nadia's jilted, love-struck ex, David (John Larroquette) who will stop at nothing to get Nadia back and ruin their date along the way. It is almost cartoonish and silly but that's why I enjoyed it so much.""Blind Date"" was recently shown on TV Land and although I was happy to see it on TV I was appalled that the movie was butchered beyond recognition. They should not be allowed to do this to such a wonderful movie. Get the DVD.The movie ends exactly the way you would think it would. It is such a sweet story. And although I adore Bruce, there is also something very special about Kim Basinger in this role. She totally reminds me of this girl I used to know. Wild and fun, but also innocent and almost naive.If you enjoy Bruce Willis, love stories that are not sappy (I hate those idiot women's movies) or just classic '80s comedy then you will be sure to enjoy ""Blind Date.""",5,love is blind,1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,2539,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'Blind', 'Date', 'fell', 'love', 'almost', 'fast', 'Walter', 'Bruce', 'well', 'love', 'Nadia', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'such', 'funny', 'fun', 'uplifting', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'warm', 'anyone', 'beating', 'heart', 'Bruce', 'first', 'big', 'movie', 'almost', 'prelude', 'Die', 'Hard', 'was', 'also', 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'also', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'adventure', 'funny', 'catchphrases.The', 'movie', 'out', 'Walter', 'telling', 'brother', 'Ted', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'may', 'rest', 'peace', 'date', 'exclusive', 'business', 'affair', 'being', 'told', 'not', 'give', 'Nadia', 'alcohol', 'Walter', 'date', 'made', 'One', 'favorite', 'parts', 'movie', 'when', 'Walter', 'Nadia', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'words', 'did', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'said', 'express', 'emotions', 'conveyed', 'picture.After', 'getting', 'little', 'tipsy', 'Walter', 'Nadia', 'make', 'grand', 'entrance', 'snobbish', 'restaurant', 'where', 'bigwigs', 'Walter', 'job', 'are', 'Walter', 'soon', 'out', 'alcohol', 'Nadia', 'gremlin', 'love', 'part', 'Nadia', 'jackass', 'waiter', 'slapstick', 'was', 'hysterical', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'was', 'such', 'nutty', 'girl', 'was', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'when', 'went', 'up', 'Japanese', 'executive', 'wife', 'knocked', 'wig', 'head', 'Then', 'Nadia', 'ladies', 'room', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'what', 'community', 'property', 'means', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'that.The', 'rest', 'majority', 'bulk', 'movie', 'spent', 'trying', 'get', 'Nadia', 'home', 'homes', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'going', 'as', 'drunk', 'goose', 'Walter', 'also', 'deal', 'Nadia', 'jilted', 'love-struck', 'ex', 'David', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'Nadia', 'back', 'ruin', 'date', 'way', 'almost', 'cartoonish', 'silly', 'why', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'Blind', 'Date', 'was', 'recently', 'shown', 'TV', 'Land', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'TV', 'was', 'appalled', 'movie', 'was', 'butchered', 'recognition', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'do', 'such', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Get', 'DVD.The', 'movie', 'exactly', 'way', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'such', 'sweet', 'story', 'adore', 'Bruce', 'also', 'something', 'very', 'special', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'role', 'totally', 'girl', 'used', 'know', 'Wild', 'fun', 'also', 'innocent', 'almost', 'enjoy', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'love', 'stories', 'are', 'not', 'sappy', 'hate', 'idiot', 'women', 'movies', 'just', 'classic', ""'80s"", 'comedy', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'Blind', 'Date']",N/A

I don't know what it was, I normally find Bruce Willis quite nice looking, but in this he didn't do anything for me. I think it was the hair! He looks great with shorter hair (and normally I hate guys with skinheads etc), I just didn't like his hair in this.Apart from that, this film is hilarious! Kim Basinger plays the outrageous drunk quite well, and Bruce Willis plays up an almost comedic role brilliantly! There is a fantastic scene in a courtroom, which I was in fits over, and Bruce doing an extremely fake fall over some golf balls!The movie's also quite sad, at the same time, as you watch Bruce struggle as Kim's character gets the more worse for wear with the drink, and then he tries to get drunk, and embarrass her when she's sober. And then he deliberately gets her drunk just to win her back - that bit is so sweet!When you've finished watching this, you'll probably never want to go on a blind date again - or, on the other hand, be nearly married to a guy who sleeps with teddy bears, and worse of all, TALKS to them!
