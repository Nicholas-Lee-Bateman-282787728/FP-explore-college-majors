905982,A9I40WFF40R4,B0009I7O4I,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[17, 17]","I believe ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" was the first song I ever heard John Denver sing. Or it may have been ""Sunshine On My Shoulders."" For a lot of us of Denver's generation, we remember the first time we heard a particular song, its association with friends, some long since dead, others a long time missing. Many of the biggest hits are here of the man who exemplifies the best of America. He warmed us with his beautiful music; he cared about the earth. Surely he was the great O Positive. Who else would have been so at home singing with artists as different as Johnny Cash and Placido Domingo?In addition to footage of John singing, there is also commentary by him about his songs and his love of nature as well as interviews with John's wife Annie, some of the musicians who played with him and others in the music industry. In a particularly moving segment Annie remembers all the unusual places she has heard ""Annie's Song,"" from a square in Venice to an elevator in Japan. Someone else comments that Wagner had one piece of wedding music while John had two!Looking at this DVD once again, as always I am amazed at how John Denver seemingly never aged. Of course now he belongs to the ages although he left us far too soon. It is useless to speculate about how many other great songs he would have written as he became older and more venerable, the elder statesman of the folk/pop world. Near the end of this not-to-be-missed tribute to John Denver, his wife comments softly that ""we miss him.""

The sight of the stones with the words of his songs carved on them was wonderful.  Now that I have the DVD instead of the copy from the PBS special I see how much his voice changed over the years.  The l995 Wildlife concert shows him looking older but his voice so much richer.  And, on this Remembered DVD it is evident as some of the songs are from the early days and some from later at the end of his career and life.  When I saw him in concert in the mid 70s I thought he was wonderful but I wish I'd seen one of the later concerts when he had matured so much.  What a great talent. A genius in my estimation.

The DVD chapters aren't chronological, but rather each attempts to address a different aspect of his career (for example, some of the chapter titles are ""A Steward of the Earth,"" ""The Embodiment of Love,"" and ""The Showman"").  There are also many interviews with the people who knew JD best, and this helps to weave the chapters together.However, I did realize eventually that this DVD covers mainly JD's RCA career, which ended around 1986.  That might be because the vast majority of his hits came from the 1970s, but even the concert footage included on the DVD (four songs) are from the 1970s and early 1980s.  There is nothing here from 1986 to 1997 (the year he died).  While that's not absolutely necessary, I suppose, it felt to me like it was lacking something.Still, despite this, I enjoyed the program.
