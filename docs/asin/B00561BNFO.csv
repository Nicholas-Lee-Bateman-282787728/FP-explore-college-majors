1443828,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00561BNFO,B. E Jackson,"[4, 5]","An Invisible Sign isn't *anything* like what I was expecting.  It's honestly only *partially* a love story, though the brief moments where Jessica Alba's character gets romantic with her boyfriend are definitely the least appealing aspects of the film, hence the reason I took exactly 1 point off the ratings scale.Anyway the storyline is about Jessica Alba getting the opportunity to be a teacher (thanks to her rude and uncaring mother) to a bunch of kids who have a serious problem sitting still and behaving.  Yeah, like ALL kids!  What's interesting is that she already *knew* she wasn't cut out for the job which is why she initially didn't want to accept it, so it doesn't exactly come as a shock when she discovers the kids are hard to tolerate and keep under control.Well, that's how the storyline *starts*.  From there it just turns into a weird mess.  Let's see.  She's obsessed with numbers, and the movie writers tried to wrap a storyline around her fascination with numbers (including her neighbor who's an old man that taught her this particular obsession) but... there's more to it than that.  At least I think so.  The entire numbers concept seemed boring to me and unnecessary anyway.She develops a special friendship with one of her students because the little girls mom is dying of... eye cancer.  Yeah, seriously.  Of course you can probably guess what's going to happen at the end of the movie because the build-up is nothing particularly *different* concerning the tired and old ""parent dies, what happens to child?"" storylines.  You've seen this same set up a thousand times in other movies, and it isn't executed any differently here.  Still, just in case it's not obvious enough, I won't come right out and SAY what happens.The best part for me is around 70 minutes in, when *something* happens in the classroom.  This is actually a REALLY shocking series of unfortunate events that takes place, and it happens suddenly so do NOT miss this segment!  I was almost certain that what takes place was even WORSE thanks to the slow motion effect, until we discover what really happens.  Yikes!Anyway yeah, besides falling in love with a guy who works at the school (well, reluctantly falls in love with- you'll see what I mean) I really like how shy and timid Jessica Alba's character is.  It's VERY different from the kind of open and boisterous things we've seen her star in before.  I liked it.The one aspect of An Invisible Sign that seems hard to really understand is Jessica's father who had something happen to him and he never recovered, so he spends his days with his head in the clouds so to speak.  His lost his mind somewhere along the line.  Never really understood what happened to him, even though it tried to be explained in the beginning.  Strange.Overall, no, this isn't a romantic comedy at all.  It's more than that.  I recommend it.",4,strangely appealing,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,2874,"['Invisible', 'Sign', ""n't"", '*anything*', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'honestly', 'only', 'love', 'story', 'brief', 'moments', 'where', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'character', 'romantic', 'boyfriend', 'are', 'definitely', 'least', 'appealing', 'aspects', 'film', 'hence', 'reason', 'took', 'exactly', '1', 'point', 'ratings', 'scale.Anyway', 'storyline', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'getting', 'opportunity', 'be', 'teacher', 'thanks', 'rude', 'uncaring', 'mother', 'bunch', 'kids', 'who', 'have', 'serious', 'problem', 'sitting', 'still', 'behaving', 'Yeah', 'kids', 'What', 'interesting', 'already', '*knew*', 'was', ""n't"", 'cut', 'out', 'job', 'why', 'initially', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'accept', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'come', 'shock', 'when', 'kids', 'are', 'hard', 'tolerate', 'keep', 'control.Well', 'how', 'storyline', '*starts*', 'just', 'weird', 'mess', 'Let', 'see', 'obsessed', 'numbers', 'movie', 'writers', 'tried', 'wrap', 'storyline', 'fascination', 'numbers', 'including', 'neighbor', 'who', 'old', 'man', 'taught', 'particular', 'obsession', 'more', 'least', 'think', 'so', 'entire', 'numbers', 'concept', 'seemed', 'boring', 'unnecessary', 'anyway.She', 'special', 'friendship', 'one', 'students', 'little', 'girls', 'mom', 'dying', 'eye', 'cancer', 'Yeah', 'seriously', 'course', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'end', 'movie', 'build-up', 'nothing', 'particularly', '*different*', 'concerning', 'tired', 'old', 'parent', 'dies', 'what', 'child', 'storylines', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'same', 'set', 'up', 'thousand', 'times', 'other', 'movies', ""n't"", 'executed', 'differently', 'here', 'Still', 'just', 'case', 'not', 'obvious', 'enough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'right', 'SAY', 'what', 'happens.The', 'best', 'part', '70', 'minutes', 'when', '*something*', 'classroom', 'actually', 'REALLY', 'shocking', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'place', 'suddenly', 'so', 'do', 'NOT', 'miss', 'segment', 'was', 'almost', 'certain', 'what', 'place', 'was', 'even', 'WORSE', 'thanks', 'slow', 'motion', 'effect', 'discover', 'what', 'really', 'Yikes', 'Anyway', 'yeah', 'falling', 'love', 'guy', 'who', 'school', 'well', 'reluctantly', 'love', 'with-', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'really', 'how', 'shy', 'timid', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'character', 'VERY', 'different', 'kind', 'open', 'boisterous', 'things', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'star', 'liked', 'it.The', 'one', 'aspect', 'Invisible', 'Sign', 'hard', 'really', 'understand', 'Jessica', 'father', 'who', 'had', 'something', 'happen', 'never', 'recovered', 'days', 'head', 'clouds', 'so', 'speak', 'lost', 'mind', 'somewhere', 'line', 'Never', 'really', 'understood', 'what', 'happened', 'even', 'tried', 'be', 'explained', 'beginning', 'Strange.Overall', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'comedy', 'more', 'recommend']",N/A

The neurosis and other psychological symptoms/behaviors were inaccurate as well as poorly acted. I've seen much more realistic and interesting behavior in institutional settings. Tossing an individual into a classroom to teach without experience, credentials or background just doesn't happen. The degree to which a classroom is out of control as shown in the movie would have had the teacher dismissed within three days. The stand in a corner punishment routines not only haven't been used for decades but are counterproductive. The lack of monitoring by administration in bringing items like an ax into a classroom is as bizarre as much as it is not real. The lesson plans shown were meaningless. And, putting a couple of addition or multiplication problems on a blackboard represents poor teaching. Ughhh! Overall, just poor attention to detail and research by the writer and director.The plot line of dysfunctional adults whether teachers, parents or others in the movie seemed hackneyed and edited like a collage to make a story for no other reason than to create some bizarre dramatic effect. The script was so contrived and artificial it seemed like the actors were refraining themselves from laughing before reciting their lines. The subplot of romance between the math and science teacher not only added nothing to the central storyline of a teacher finding herself while helping a student seemed like some sophomoric high school teacher-sex plot line. The next pairing will be the music and art teacher followed by romance in the dramatic arts department and literature department.

Its about a girl who is to herself, quirky, and very creative. She sees things in different ways which inspire creativity. I really just want to write about what I liked. I loved the way she spent hours fixing her room and the bulletin boards, how she could see the way parts could fit together. I related to her world inside. She had a hard time connecting with others but it was shown in a way to make her special and unique. Her way of having children use their bodies to understand shapes, the way she thought of things rather than looking at lessons written in a book, done repitively throughout years of teaching. She wasn't your normal teacher and the staff was fun too. They weren't distant towards her uniqueness and they were unique too. They had personalities that made them different, not the bonding and belonging that sometimes happens, sometimes from burnout and forgetting your creativity.

1443837,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B00561BNFO,Thomas M. Sipos,"[7, 8]","This was an ALMOST perfect indie film -- an original tale about quirky, marginalized characters. But it's ruined when, during the film's last five minutes, an artificially sappy, happy Hollywood ending is tacked on.Mona (Jessica Alba) is an emotionally troubled young woman. Her father appears to be schizophrenic. It's likely that Mona has inherited his mental disease (whatever that is) and will worsen with time.Mona gets a job teaching math, though her mother lied about Mona having a college degree. Then a science teacher courts Mona, but she can't connect with him (or anyone). After he kisses her, she runs away and eats soap. She drives him away. Mona also brings an ax into class, because it's shaped like the number 7.SPOILERS ...Near the film's end, there's a classroom fight. Two of Mona's (also emotionally troubled) girl students fight over the ax (while the boys fight over a prosthetic limb). One of the girls just lost her mother to cancer. The other girl's parents are going through a messy divorce. In the aftermath, one girl's forehead is bloodied against a glass pane. The other girl (carrying the ax) slips on urine, with the ax embedding itself into Mona's leg.Mona is fired by the school.Up until now, the film was filled with moments of poignancy and honest emotion -- but then in the FINAL 5 MINUTES -- after Mona's firing -- everything turns around for her with sudden ease.* Mona is suddenly able to love the science teacher.* Mona adopts the student who lost her mother to cancer.* Mona's attorney threatens to sue the school, resulting in Mona getting her teaching job back.This fake, SAPPY Hollywood ending ruins an otherwise courageous indie film.The lawsuit is especially FAKE. Mona's attorney says that Mona has an excellent case against the school (for wrongful termination, one presumes).ON WHAT PLANET?* Mona has NO college degree. Her mother LIED to the school district about her qualifications, and Mona supported that lie. She is legally unqualified to teach. It wouldn't matter if she now promises to go to night school to get her degree, they can still fire her.* One student was INJURED under Mona's supervision -- and others were endangered all because Mona brought an AX to class! Mona is lucky she isn't sued by the student's guardian. The guardian certainly has an excellent lawsuit against the school district.* On top of which, Mona is still in her first year of teaching. She'd be under probation, without tenure. It'd be EASY to fire her, for a lot less.The filmmakers should have kept the film real, honest, and authentic. Mona should not have had such an artificially happy turnaround on all fronts -- gets the guy, adopts the kid, gets her job back despite having NO case whatsoever against the school district.I loved this film until the last 5 minutes, but the dishonest ending left a bad taste in my mouth.",3,"great indie film RUINED by fake, sappy Hollywood ending",1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,2864,"['was', 'ALMOST', 'perfect', 'indie', 'film', 'original', 'tale', 'quirky', 'marginalized', 'characters', 'ruined', 'when', 'film', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'artificially', 'sappy', 'happy', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'tacked', 'on.Mona', 'Jessica', 'Alba', 'emotionally', 'troubled', 'young', 'woman', 'father', 'be', 'schizophrenic', 'likely', 'Mona', 'inherited', 'mental', 'disease', 'will', 'worsen', 'time.Mona', 'job', 'teaching', 'math', 'mother', 'lied', 'Mona', 'having', 'college', 'degree', 'Then', 'science', 'teacher', 'courts', 'Mona', 'ca', ""n't"", 'connect', 'anyone', 'away', 'eats', 'soap', 'away', 'Mona', 'also', 'ax', 'class', 'shaped', 'number', '7.SPOILERS', 'film', 'end', 'classroom', 'fight', 'Two', 'Mona', 'also', 'emotionally', 'troubled', 'girl', 'students', 'fight', 'ax', 'boys', 'fight', 'prosthetic', 'limb', 'One', 'girls', 'just', 'lost', 'mother', 'cancer', 'other', 'girl', 'parents', 'are', 'going', 'messy', 'divorce', 'aftermath', 'one', 'girl', 'forehead', 'bloodied', 'glass', 'pane', 'other', 'girl', 'carrying', 'ax', 'urine', 'ax', 'embedding', 'Mona', 'leg.Mona', 'fired', 'school.Up', 'now', 'film', 'was', 'filled', 'moments', 'poignancy', 'honest', 'emotion', 'then', 'FINAL', '5', 'MINUTES', 'Mona', 'firing', 'everything', 'around', 'sudden', 'ease', '*', 'Mona', 'suddenly', 'able', 'love', 'science', 'teacher', 'Mona', 'student', 'who', 'lost', 'mother', 'cancer', 'Mona', 'attorney', 'sue', 'school', 'resulting', 'Mona', 'getting', 'teaching', 'job', 'back.This', 'fake', 'SAPPY', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'ruins', 'otherwise', 'courageous', 'indie', 'film.The', 'lawsuit', 'especially', 'FAKE', 'Mona', 'attorney', 'Mona', 'excellent', 'case', 'school', 'wrongful', 'termination', 'one', 'presumes', 'WHAT', 'PLANET', '*', 'Mona', 'NO', 'college', 'degree', 'mother', 'LIED', 'school', 'district', 'qualifications', 'Mona', 'supported', 'lie', 'legally', 'unqualified', 'teach', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'now', 'go', 'night', 'school', 'get', 'degree', 'can', 'still', 'fire', '*', 'One', 'student', 'was', 'INJURED', 'Mona', 'supervision', 'others', 'were', 'endangered', 'Mona', 'brought', 'AX', 'class', 'Mona', 'lucky', ""n't"", 'sued', 'student', 'guardian', 'guardian', 'certainly', 'excellent', 'lawsuit', 'school', 'district', '*', 'top', 'Mona', 'still', 'first', 'year', 'teaching', ""'d"", 'be', 'probation', 'tenure', ""'d"", 'be', 'EASY', 'fire', 'lot', 'less.The', 'filmmakers', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'film', 'real', 'honest', 'authentic', 'Mona', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'such', 'artificially', 'happy', 'turnaround', 'fronts', 'guy', 'kid', 'job', 'back', 'having', 'NO', 'case', 'whatsoever', 'school', 'district.I', 'loved', 'film', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'dishonest', 'ending', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth']",N/A
