422335,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,6304441630,a voice of reason,"[15, 15]","""Last Stand at Saber River"" was the first of three excellent Westerns that Tom Selleck made for TNT between 1997 and 2003 (and I'm still hoping there'll be at least a fourth one some day). Selleck has starred in five made-for-TV Westerns total, three of which are based on Louis L'Amour stories. This one, however, is based on a book by Elmore Leonard, and the difference is obvious in both the lack of idealism and in the extreme violence.Selleck is Paul Cable, a Confederate cavalryman who has come home from the Civil War (only slightly) early. He knows the war is lost for the South, he is worn out, and he only wants to take his family back to their homestead in Arizona to live a normal life. His wife, who was told that he was dead, is less than thrilled to have him back home because she is resentful that he left to fight in the war in the first place. Suzy Amis does an excellent job as Martha Cable. She is not the stereotypical beauty who runs around in a bustle under fancy dresses. She is a tough frontierswoman who has experienced many hardships and gets her husband out of some tight spots as the movie progresses.While the majority of the movie is good at depicting the divisions between North and South that caused the Civil War and which the Civil War then exacerbated, the subplot of the inner struggles that Paul and Martha Cable face is far more interesting. It's a great movie until the end, when we get the additional time-worn subplot of a Confederate soldier who just can't give up the Lost Cause. No, it's not Selleck's character who has this problem, but Selleck already had covered this territory in 1982's ""The Shadow Riders"" (though it wasn't his character who wanted to keep fighting in that movie either); John Wayne's ""The Undefeated"" is another well-known film with the Lost Cause plotline.In spite of the needlessly melodramatic ending, this is a strong Western. Selleck and TNT kept getting better and better with ""Crossfire Trail"" and ""Monte Walsh"".

This one has Tom playing Cable, a confederate soldier who has left the war early because he knows it is over and the South has lost. It just hasn't been declared yet. His family and friends thought him to be dead, and the reunion seems a bit shaky. His wife played by Suzy Amis, is a tough as nails no nonsense frontier woman that knows guns well from her fathers gunsmithing business.Eventually she works things out with her husband Cable and it is a good thing he has her to back him since she is great with a gun. Even though Cable believes the war is over he finds sympathizers trying to enlist his aid in the confederate cause but he shuns them. When he is accused of murdering a retired Union officer he must track down the real murderer and bring him to justice.

422351,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6304441630,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Over the years, Tom Selleck has developed into somewhat of a western icon. And why not? Selleck is spot on in fleshing out those qualities most cherished by folks of the untamed old west. And, of course, it doesn't hurt that he looks the part, all tall and rugged and bemustached. He's at it again in LAST STAND AT SABER RIVER, the 1997 TNT oater. In this one, he plays Paul Cable, a weary ex-Confederate soldier who returns home to Texas, knowing full well that the war between the states has already been lost, even as it rages on.The terrible war has left scars on Cable, but it's also deeply impacted his wife and children. In his absence, his family had learned how to get on. His suddenly showing up causes tension to surface and mount as everyone is forced to cope with the new family dynamics. In particular, Cable's relationship with his steely wife Martha is in the crumbles. His wife never did see why Cable had to go off to war in the first place. During his years away, their daughter fell ill and passed away, and this leaves a lingering bitterness within Martha. She is so deeply resentful of her husband.Struggling to readjust, Paul Cable takes his family back to the Arizona territory, back to their old homestead. But it ends up becoming yet another battle for Cable as he learns that Union sympathizers have overran his ranch. With his wife and children directly imperiled, Paul Cable means to fight one last time, to keep his land and his family.LAST STAND AT SABER RIVER, adapted from Elmore Leonard's gritty novel, is more a contemplative western drama than a typical shoot-em-up, although things do climax with two pretty darn good action sequences. Much of the tension is provided by Selleck and Suzy Amis, who is very good and intense as his estranged wife Martha. Tom Selleck has done this type of role so often now that he can do it in his sleep. Not to say that dude is sleepwalking here. Selleck brings a worn down gravity to his role. His character is stoic, although he's good enough that you glimpse the sub-text of alienation, of a man tired of warring and who merely wants a return to a normal life. Selleck exudes quiet strength and enough machismo that he gets away with sporting a pink-colored shirt for much of the film. Veteran western actors and brothers, Keith and David Carradine, step in for good performances, particularly Keith, whose character rises above the role of predictable designated villain. And, whoever that girl is who plays David Carradine's refined but bored daughter, well, she's muy caliente.Tom Selleck hasn't disappointed in any of his western films, although it's been a few years since he's done one, what with his involvement with the Jesse Stone movies.

It is set in The Arizona Territory in the time period immediately following the Civil War.  The plot, the acting, and especially the weapons used are all superb, and in the case of the firearms very authentic to the period!  In fact Sellecks's character, Paul Cable, is first seen coming home from the war and stopping off in Texas to gather his family.  It is here where Cable is given a beautifully engraved, ivory handled Colt conversion revolver that his father in law gunsmith built for him while he was away. (The gun itself was actually custom built for Selleck on an actual Colt 1851 Navy revolver by R&D; Gunshop and is a museum quality reproduction - correct in every detail.)  And which he uses, along with his Henry rifle, to great affect during the many shootouts to protect his life, land, and property.  If you love western movies, and especially if you love authentic western firearms, you'll love this movie. I heartily recommend it!I truly believe that if westerns were as popular today as they were in John Wayne's time, Tom Selleck would have become an even bigger star than the Duke himself, and this is coming from a huge John Wayne fan!Jeremy L ArmourP.S.

422356,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,6304441630,J. Munyon,"[1, 2]","""Last Stand At Saber River"" stars Tom Selleck and Suzy Amis as a couple being reunited at the end of the Civil War, as Tom Selleck's character returns from Confederate soldier duty.  Upon arrival back with his pioneer woman spouse (staying with her father in TX), he discovers one of his children has died while he was away, and returning to his home in Arizona, also finds out his property there has been confiscated by the opposing side Union army.  As the story unfolds further, Keith Carradine and David Carradine (Union army sympathizers) tangle indirectly with Tom Selleck and Suzy Amis.  Tracey Needham portrays her role as sister to Keith Carradine, and visits Tom Selleck while Suzy Amis is away.  It's just a movie, so even though she's living in the raw wilderness of circa 1865 as a seasoned mustang handler amidst an otherwise male bastion crew, naturally Tracey Needham is absolutely drop dead gorgeous and looks like she just walked out of Saks Fifth Avenue; so lovely you can smell her perfume just watching the movie.  Made me wish this movie had been rated ""R"" instead of being a made-for-TV flick.  Suzy Amis is attractive too, don't get me wrong, and I'd definitely want Suzy Amis on my side of a gunfight.  The movie flows along nicely, with a sort of sluggish start.  The bad guy gets his due, and as the movie draws to conclusion, Suzy Amis decides to be less spiteful and angry, which means Tom Selleck is going to finally get to have Sir Lancelot make a significant deposit with the Fort Knox vault.  Which gives a whole new meaning to otherwise ending a movie by horseback riding off into the sunset as the camera fades to black.

422357,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,6304441630,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[34, 36]","Tom Selleck does a great job in westerns. He plays the gritty, no-nonsense type well and does so with a sense of style and determination reminiscent of the Duke. He does so in this film. It's a shame, it not better than it is.Selleck plays a confederate officer near the end of the war. He knows the war is a lost cause and he has been disillusioned. He heads back to Texas to pick up his family with a mind of taking them back out to their homestead in Arizona. Everyone is surprised to see him. They all believe he is dead. He is in turn surprised to find that his youngest child is dead. The news had not gotten to him for years. Meeting up with the wife is a strain. They have some personal issues to deal with and each has a generous share of emotional baggage. Dealing with the baggage, though takes time and there are other issues to deal with.Selleck's spread in Arizona has been taken over by people who thought he was dead. They are Union sympathizers and have no use for a former Confederate. Selleck, though, just wants to get on with his life and repair the damage to his family. This is easier said than done. The Union folk see him as a threat to their lives and their profits. There is also a diehard Confederate who runs the dry goods store. He runs guns for the Confederacy and tries to suck Selleck into his machinations. When the war does end, he is unable to let it go and continues to stir up trouble for which Selleck is blamed. It is only when the Yankees and Confederates begin to work together that healing begins to take place in both the community and the family.This film is mostly well done. The characters are strong and the production values are good. The problem is that it is utterly predictable in most places and that there is little sense of excitement. It was worth watching but not worth owning. That is a disappointment. It could have been more.As an additional note, other reviewers have reported problems with the disk. I too had a problem. After the introductory screen, the tv went black and a menu never came up. The movie did start when I pushed ""play"" and it displayed without problems. When the show was over, the menu was accessible. Reloading the DVD yielded similar results. The screen would go black but the movie would play when you hit the ""play"" button.

Thanks to Ted Turner and his love for American Western film making, the long lost western has been reborn in a big way.  Tom Selleck continues to impress audiences as a true western hero in the tradition of John Wayne.  Selleck is more than adequate for the part, big in body and big in acting skill.  He takes the part of Paul Cable, and turns his character into someone we can believe, like, and respect.Cable comes back from the Civil War months before its official end. He is tired of war and killing, and wants to return home to raise cattle in his home state of Arizona.  In trying to escape his wartime experiences, Cable runs into more trouble at home.  He finds his wife terribly embittered by his absence, and his home farm is now run by former union soldiers who are naturally hostile to a returning Confederate soldier.  Cable must not only fight to regain his farm, but he must also try to rekindle the love that has been lost in his marriage.The story by Elmore Leonard is a solid one and very believable.  There are no dull or boring scenes, the picture grabs you and holds you throughout.  Selleck is terrific as Paul Cable, fighting for his family, his woman, and his life.  Selleck once again establishes himself as a solid western actor in the mould of John Wayne.  He is every man's western hero. Selleck carries the picture on his broad shoulders with ease.  He is supported with a fine ensemble cast, including Suzy Amis as his embittered gritty wife, and Haley Joel Osment (of ""The Sixth Sense"" fame) in a minor role as Selleck's son.  Amis portrays a western pioneering woman in perhaps one of the most realistic role ever portrayed.  Too many times we see western wonmen portrayed as prissy and prim, dressed in their long skirts and blouses without a scuff or mark of western sand or dirt.  Amis' portrayal as Mrs. Cable breaks the mould; we see her with dirt and dust on her face, with sweat dripping in lines across her face, and with a surprising ability to hold her own with wagon reins in her hands, or for that matter, a rifle.  I personally welcome this portrayal of western women, as it is undoubtedly more realistic than the western wife sitting pretty in her muti-layered petticoats.  David and Keith Cariidine are fine antagonists in the fight for the family farm.  Harry Carey Jr. plays a small role as Selleck's father-in-law.As a collector of fine western films, I intend to keep ""Last Stand at Saber River"", as it is an excellent western film in the tradition of the great Hollywood westerns; it's not an epic, but it is fine film-making and will please those craving for a fine western drama. I recommend it.James ""Konedog"" Koenig",4,Who Says Westerns are Dead?,1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,2891,"['age', 'Hollywood', 'western', 'had', 'apex', 'middle', '20th', 'century', 'then', 'change', 'modern', 'society', '1960', 'western', 'genre', 'lost', 'allure', 'Hollywood', 'abandoned', 'westerns', 'other', 'fare', 'Thanks', 'Ted', 'Turner', 'love', 'American', 'Western', 'film', 'making', 'long', 'lost', 'western', 'been', 'reborn', 'big', 'way', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'impress', 'audiences', 'true', 'western', 'hero', 'tradition', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Selleck', 'more', 'adequate', 'part', 'big', 'body', 'big', 'acting', 'skill', 'part', 'Paul', 'Cable', 'character', 'someone', 'can', 'believe', 'respect.Cable', 'back', 'Civil', 'War', 'months', 'official', 'end', 'tired', 'war', 'killing', 'return', 'home', 'raise', 'cattle', 'home', 'state', 'Arizona', 'trying', 'escape', 'wartime', 'experiences', 'Cable', 'more', 'trouble', 'home', 'wife', 'terribly', 'embittered', 'absence', 'home', 'farm', 'now', 'run', 'former', 'union', 'soldiers', 'who', 'are', 'naturally', 'hostile', 'returning', 'Confederate', 'soldier', 'Cable', 'must', 'not', 'only', 'fight', 'regain', 'farm', 'must', 'also', 'try', 'rekindle', 'love', 'been', 'lost', 'marriage.The', 'story', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'solid', 'one', 'very', 'believable', 'are', 'dull', 'boring', 'scenes', 'picture', 'grabs', 'Selleck', 'terrific', 'Paul', 'Cable', 'fighting', 'family', 'woman', 'life', 'Selleck', 'once', 'again', 'solid', 'western', 'actor', 'mould', 'John', 'Wayne', 'man', 'western', 'hero', 'Selleck', 'picture', 'broad', 'shoulders', 'ease', 'supported', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'including', 'Suzy', 'Amis', 'embittered', 'gritty', 'wife', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'fame', 'minor', 'role', 'Selleck', 'son', 'Amis', 'western', 'pioneering', 'woman', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'realistic', 'role', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'Too', 'many', 'times', 'see', 'western', 'wonmen', 'portrayed', 'prissy', 'prim', 'dressed', 'long', 'skirts', 'blouses', 'scuff', 'mark', 'western', 'sand', 'dirt', 'Amis', 'portrayal', 'Mrs.', 'Cable', 'mould', 'see', 'dirt', 'dust', 'face', 'sweat', 'dripping', 'lines', 'face', 'surprising', 'ability', 'hold', 'own', 'wagon', 'reins', 'hands', 'matter', 'rifle', 'personally', 'welcome', 'portrayal', 'western', 'women', 'undoubtedly', 'more', 'realistic', 'western', 'wife', 'sitting', 'pretty', 'muti-layered', 'petticoats', 'David', 'Keith', 'Cariidine', 'are', 'fine', 'antagonists', 'fight', 'family', 'farm', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'small', 'role', 'Selleck', 'father-in-law.As', 'collector', 'fine', 'western', 'films', 'intend', 'keep', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Saber', 'River', 'excellent', 'western', 'film', 'tradition', 'great', 'Hollywood', 'westerns', 'not', 'epic', 'fine', 'film-making', 'will', 'please', 'craving', 'fine', 'western', 'drama', 'recommend', 'it.James', 'Konedog', 'Koenig']",Last Stand at Saber River VHS

422370,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,6304441630,Steven Hancock,"[0, 0]","Though the western has all but disappeared from the cinemas these days, the genre is by no means dead. Instead, it has moved to the realm of the small screen. ""Last Stand at Saver River"" is just one example of the many westerns that have come on TV since the late 1970s. Featuring Tom Selleck as an ex-Confederate returning home, this is a fine film that deals with the effects of war on both a person and their family. While not one of the greatest efforts from TNT, the sometimes weak storyline gets elevated through terrific performances, including one of Selleck's greatest, and great gunfights and action sequences.

422371,A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ,6304441630,Todd7,"[0, 0]","Last Stand at Saber River is a good western that has a more emotional tone than most westerns. This time Selleck plays Paul Cable, a Confederate soldier who unexpectedly comes home, but not before generating anger and animosity from his wife. Cable tries to rebuild his stance as a family man, while contending with Union loyalists who took over his property when he was at war. Cable's wife, Martha, is a woman of strength and resilience, and knows how to stand up to a fight. Her husband's absence while trying to raise two small children only strengthens her resolve; she lets her passion spill over into fighting alongside her husband for what's right, even if she didn't agree with how things went in the past. In the end, she accepts her husband, and learns to love again. This film has its share of gun fights, and the scenery is good. I would've liked to have seen a more expansive set and environment in this one, but what was presented here is still acceptable. To me, westerns have the saloon, bartender, rides through town, and a lot of gunslinging. Last Stand at Saber River is a western with a human touch, and is enjoyable to watch. 8/10",4,Another Good Selleck Western,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,1152,"['Last', 'Stand', 'Saber', 'River', 'good', 'western', 'more', 'emotional', 'tone', 'most', 'westerns', 'time', 'Selleck', 'Paul', 'Cable', 'Confederate', 'soldier', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'home', 'not', 'generating', 'anger', 'animosity', 'wife', 'Cable', 'tries', 'rebuild', 'stance', 'family', 'man', 'contending', 'Union', 'loyalists', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'property', 'when', 'was', 'war', 'Cable', 'wife', 'Martha', 'woman', 'strength', 'resilience', 'how', 'stand', 'up', 'fight', 'husband', 'absence', 'trying', 'raise', 'two', 'small', 'children', 'only', 'resolve', 'passion', 'spill', 'fighting', 'husband', 'what', 'right', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'how', 'things', 'went', 'past', 'end', 'husband', 'love', 'again', 'film', 'share', 'gun', 'fights', 'scenery', 'good', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'expansive', 'set', 'environment', 'one', 'what', 'was', 'presented', 'here', 'still', 'acceptable', 'westerns', 'have', 'saloon', 'bartender', 'town', 'lot', 'gunslinging', 'Last', 'Stand', 'Saber', 'River', 'western', 'human', 'touch', 'enjoyable', 'watch', '8/10']",Last Stand at Saber River VHS
