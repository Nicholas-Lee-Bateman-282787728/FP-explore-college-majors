Then as I watched more I became hooked.  The animation works brilliantly as they illustrate scenes and ideas that are being discussed.  I believe that Karl is genuine - no one could make him up, he's too perfect - but I think also it's easy to overlook that he's not an idiot, he's not stupid, he just has some odd views of things.  He also makes some very funny comments that are just brilliant, but his sense of humor seems to dry that he never laughs.All three seasons of this show are brilliant.  It's so funny and there are times I've cried I've laughed so hard.  But it's not for everyone.  If the idea of listening to three guys talk for half an hour doesn't appeal to you, then it might not be for you.",5,Love it!,1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,816,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'show', 'couple', 'years', 'thought', 'Ricky', 'Stephen', 'were', 'just', 'being', 'mean', 'Karl', 'Then', 'watched', 'more', 'became', 'hooked', 'animation', 'brilliantly', 'illustrate', 'scenes', 'ideas', 'are', 'being', 'discussed', 'believe', 'Karl', 'genuine', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'up', 'too', 'perfect', 'think', 'also', 'easy', 'overlook', 'not', 'idiot', 'not', 'stupid', 'just', 'odd', 'views', 'things', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'comments', 'are', 'just', 'brilliant', 'sense', 'humor', 'dry', 'never', 'laughs.All', 'three', 'seasons', 'show', 'are', 'brilliant', 'so', 'funny', 'are', 'times', ""'ve"", 'cried', ""'ve"", 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'not', 'everyone', 'idea', 'listening', 'three', 'guys', 'talk', 'hour', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'then', 'might', 'not', 'be']",N/A

However, he is truly one dimensional, either in real life or as a character, no meanness, no vengefulness to look forward to.Ricky you really have to see visually - he really is a short fat man who is physically captivating to watch.  This animated podcast format does not do justice.I rarely stop watching a series, but this series, I really faded out towards the last two episodes, and I cannot swear that I watched it to the end.

I will watch them all, but I feel I already have enough information to write a comment for this product.I am a big Ricky Gervais fan, and I do enjoy his brand of humor, however I find this show to be sorely lacking in entertainment. Yes, I realize the original source is old pod casts which have had minimal animation added, but still... The tone of these `discussions' is very, VERY mean spirited. Okay, I get it. They are trying to stomp out stupid reasoning. I applaud the effort. However, poor Karl Pilkerton is so inarticulate. He doesn't stand a chance. I found myself immensely annoyed by Ricky throughout the episodes I have watched so far. Yes, Karl is saying stupid things, and advocating stupid un-thought out ideas, but for God's sake let him at least get the ideas out there and on the table before you start berating him! Steve Merchant has a little more civility, but has no problem piling on to the poorly spoken Karl when the ball gets rolling. It felt like i was watching schoolyard bullies and they were expecting me to cheer them on.Perhaps my problem is that I am an Agnostic, while Ricky is a very vocal, public and proud atheist. I have read several articles recently where he has been tagged with the title of ""the new voice of atheism"". This does not bother me, but he approaches every situation in these episodes with an ""I already know the answer; you're an idiot."" attitude.  I have lived much of my life confronting and fighting this type of opinionated attitude when it is embodied by theists and evangelicals, so I was sorely disappointed to find that he was pretty much their mirror image. He cannot even let his `opponent' and `friend' even state his ideas (inane as they are) before starting the attacks. ""You're an idiot"" is heard far too frequently.Ricky's set in his ways attitude was so strong, so ingrained, so knee jerk throughout. Couple that with is over the top constantly on-the-attack personality and...ugh! Karl is such an undeserving punching bag...I have not found this show very entertaining so far. Instead it is rather cringe worthy, and I lost a lot of respect for Ricky as a reasoner. I will continue to watch this DVD and may modify my review at a later date. This might be enjoyable to some, but I only gave it two stars.Okay I have seen four episodes now. The tone softens a little, but still comes off as mean spirited as a whole. My overall opinion stands.",2,Sorely dissapointed by this one...,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,2519,"['honesty', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'only', 'first', '2', 'part', 'third', 'will', 'watch', 'feel', 'already', 'have', 'enough', 'information', 'write', 'comment', 'product.I', 'am', 'big', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'fan', 'do', 'enjoy', 'brand', 'humor', 'however', 'find', 'show', 'be', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'entertainment', 'Yes', 'realize', 'original', 'source', 'old', 'pod', 'casts', 'have', 'had', 'minimal', 'animation', 'added', 'still', 'tone', 'discussions', 'very', 'VERY', 'mean', 'spirited', 'Okay', 'get', 'are', 'trying', 'stomp', 'out', 'stupid', 'reasoning', 'applaud', 'effort', 'However', 'poor', 'Karl', 'Pilkerton', 'so', 'inarticulate', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'found', 'immensely', 'annoyed', 'Ricky', 'episodes', 'have', 'watched', 'so', 'far', 'Yes', 'Karl', 'saying', 'stupid', 'things', 'advocating', 'stupid', 'un-thought', 'ideas', 'God', 'sake', 'let', 'least', 'get', 'ideas', 'there', 'table', 'start', 'berating', 'Steve', 'Merchant', 'little', 'more', 'civility', 'problem', 'piling', 'poorly', 'spoken', 'Karl', 'when', 'ball', 'rolling', 'felt', 'i', 'was', 'watching', 'schoolyard', 'bullies', 'were', 'expecting', 'cheer', 'on.Perhaps', 'problem', 'am', 'Agnostic', 'Ricky', 'very', 'vocal', 'public', 'proud', 'atheist', 'have', 'read', 'several', 'articles', 'recently', 'where', 'been', 'tagged', 'title', 'new', 'voice', 'atheism', 'not', 'bother', 'situation', 'episodes', 'already', 'know', 'answer', ""'re"", 'idiot', 'attitude', 'have', 'lived', 'much', 'life', 'confronting', 'fighting', 'type', 'opinionated', 'attitude', 'when', 'embodied', 'theists', 'evangelicals', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'find', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'mirror', 'image', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'let', 'opponent', 'friend', 'even', 'state', 'ideas', 'inane', 'are', 'starting', 'attacks', ""'re"", 'idiot', 'heard', 'far', 'too', 'frequently.Ricky', 'set', 'ways', 'attitude', 'was', 'so', 'strong', 'so', 'ingrained', 'so', 'knee', 'jerk', 'Couple', 'top', 'constantly', 'on-the-attack', 'personality', 'ugh', 'Karl', 'such', 'undeserving', 'punching', 'bag', 'have', 'not', 'found', 'show', 'very', 'entertaining', 'so', 'far', 'Instead', 'rather', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'lost', 'lot', 'respect', 'Ricky', 'reasoner', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', 'DVD', 'may', 'modify', 'review', 'later', 'date', 'might', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'only', 'gave', 'two', 'stars.Okay', 'have', 'seen', 'four', 'episodes', 'now', 'tone', 'little', 'still', 'off', 'mean', 'spirited', 'whole', 'overall', 'opinion', 'stands']",N/A

1389348,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0049AF6UG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[27, 33]","I'm going to start things out on a controversial note.  I love Ricky Gervais and, honestly, I'd watch anything with his name on it.  But ""The Ricky Gervais Show"" is a bit of a curiosity.  While I definitely enjoyed it (these 13 episodes originally aired on HBO), I'm not sure the program was entirely necessary.  Before you start to beat me up and send me hate mail--let me explain.  The show uses material previously introduced on the famously outrageous Podcast starring Gervais and his long time partner Stephen Merchant.  In essence, ""The Ricky Gervais Show"" is just an animated Podcast.  None of the comedy stylings or interactions are new--only the visual representations of them are.  Mind you, I don't think too many people will complain as both new and old material meld together well to create different levels of humor to the cracking wise.Gervais definitely plays to his strengths here.  And his primary strength is the ever daft Karl Pilkington.  Pilkington is a perpetual guest on the Podcast, and every episode of this show is designed around his skewed world view.  Merchant and Gervais taunt and mock Pilkington mercilessly--it seems to be, literally, the reason that this show exists.  I'd feel sorry for the little guy if it wasn't so darned funny.  Pilkington is a truly original voice and the series' MVP.  Half the time you'll think he's putting you on with his wacky declarations, but I'm not so sure.I also enjoyed the running gag of ""Monkey News"" which never gets old when spinning ridiculous ""news"" stories involving primates.  Bottom line, if you enjoy Gervais' particular brand of humor, I can't imagine that you wouldn't like ""The Ricky Gervais Show.""  From a visual standpoint, it can be somewhat stagnant--at least 60% of the animation is the three guys sitting in a studio.  But the humor is top notch.  Funny, sometimes insightful, I liked hanging out with this trio in 30 minute intervals.  Hopefully, you will too.

The use of the British language is so great; it is hard to believe they're speaking English. I wonder if they have a hard time understanding Americans.
