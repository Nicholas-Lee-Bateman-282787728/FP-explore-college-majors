If you have Circuit 1-2 don't buy this, it is all the same moves in the same order, they just add one more round to each exercise group. In other words, instead of doing two reps o each circuit you do three, boring after doing 1-2 for a month!",2,REALLY?,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,299,"['Hey', 'how', ""'bout"", 'little', 'effort', 'make', 'different', 'DVD', 'have', 'Circuit', '1-2', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'same', 'moves', 'same', 'order', 'just', 'add', 'one', 'more', 'round', 'exercise', 'group', 'other', 'words', 'instead', 'doing', 'two', 'reps', 'circuit', 'do', 'three', 'boring', 'doing', '1-2', 'month']",N/A
914095,A1MCQLJGZ2ODCK,B0009VS6H4,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I am writing this review as someone going through the Power 90 program. I am almost through day 60 (week 8 of 13). So far the program works great, this review goes over only this video. A side note, I would recommend the program, I think it is well worth it. A lot of sacrifice, but you get results with your effort.As other reviewers may have said, this is very much like Sculpt 1-2. The purpose of 1-2 was to learn the moves and get your form down. Sculpt 3-4 is using what you have been doing in 1-2 and making you work harder at it. The intensity of the workout is far greater than 1-2. After switching to 3-4 you feel like it is day 1 all over again.The first 3 rounds are the same as 1-2 with the exception of slight variations starting with decline pushups. Then the reps increase dramatically for the lunges, squats, and pushups. A fourth round is added that targets forearms, lower back, and calves. It also adds upward rows for back and shoulders, then a max-out for pushups and squats to finish the workout - an intense full body workout.If you are doing Power 90 and wondering if they are worth getting because you hear they are the same, I say you should get the 3-4 versions (for both workouts) without a doubt. It will push you harder, and you will see results faster than sticking with 1-2.If you are not doing Power 90, this is a very good full body sculpting circuit routine. It is around 40 minutes that will target all of your muscle groups for a full body workout.",5,Step it up with 3-4,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,1485,"['am', 'writing', 'review', 'someone', 'going', 'Power', '90', 'program', 'am', 'almost', 'day', '60', 'week', '8', '13', 'So', 'far', 'program', 'great', 'review', 'only', 'video', 'side', 'note', 'would', 'recommend', 'program', 'think', 'well', 'worth', 'lot', 'sacrifice', 'get', 'results', 'effort.As', 'other', 'reviewers', 'may', 'have', 'said', 'very', 'much', 'Sculpt', '1-2', 'purpose', '1-2', 'was', 'learn', 'moves', 'get', 'form', 'down', 'Sculpt', '3-4', 'using', 'what', 'have', 'been', 'doing', '1-2', 'making', 'work', 'harder', 'intensity', 'workout', 'far', 'greater', '1-2', 'switching', '3-4', 'feel', 'day', '1', 'again.The', 'first', '3', 'rounds', 'are', 'same', '1-2', 'exception', 'slight', 'variations', 'starting', 'decline', 'pushups', 'Then', 'reps', 'increase', 'dramatically', 'lunges', 'squats', 'pushups', 'fourth', 'round', 'added', 'targets', 'forearms', 'lower', 'back', 'calves', 'also', 'upward', 'rows', 'back', 'shoulders', 'then', 'max-out', 'pushups', 'squats', 'finish', 'workout', 'intense', 'full', 'body', 'are', 'doing', 'Power', '90', 'wondering', 'are', 'worth', 'getting', 'hear', 'are', 'same', 'say', 'should', 'get', '3-4', 'versions', 'workouts', 'doubt', 'will', 'push', 'harder', 'will', 'see', 'results', 'faster', 'sticking', '1-2.If', 'are', 'not', 'doing', 'Power', '90', 'very', 'good', 'full', 'body', 'sculpting', 'circuit', 'routine', '40', 'minutes', 'will', 'target', 'muscle', 'groups', 'full', 'body', 'workout']",N/A

Also, one of the people on the board was actually featured in the P90X infomercial.I figured that if all that were true then obviously the program was for real and the testimonials were real people also.Anyway, I did P90X, got incredible results and now my wife is doing it and having the same success.As I was close to finishing my P90X rotation I decided that I wanted some less intense programs to use after P90X that would help me  stay fit without being as intense as P90X itself so I got Power 90 Sculpt 3-4 as well as Sweat 3-4. I am doing a mixed rotation which incorporates P90X workouts some weeks as well as Power 90 (and various other workouts).I've got to say that I was very impressed with it!Whereas P90X has more specialized bodypart workouts, Power 90 Sculpt is a whole body circuit.What's nice is that you need almost no equipment, really just some dumbells or an exercise band and you're ready to go.The exercises are basic exercises but sequenced as such :Chest, Back, Shoulders, Biceps, Triceps and Legs.Anyway, it is a real workout, it's nothing fancy but it gets the job done if you are willing to do the work. While one could certainly design their own program, the nice thing about the DVD is that it helps tremendously with pacing and motivation. Tony is very funny by the way so he keeps thing light while still working you hard.I have done other Beachbody workouts as well as P90X and Power 90 (Slim in 6 and Power Half Hour) and the thing about all of them is that they are very straightforward in terms of the fact that you have to just eat right and work hard and you'll get real results.For folks looking for a quick fix without breaking a sweat then this is NOT for you. If you are serious about really making significant changes in your body (and more importantly your health) then I'd highly recommend Power 90. But as I said, you're going to have to make a commitment to work hard at this at least 6 days a week!If you haven't worked out in a while then I'd definitely recommend getting the whole set so you can work up the intensity gradually. It includes Sculpt 1-2 and 3-4, Sweat 1-2 w/ Ab ripper 100 and Sweat 3-4 w/ Ab ripper 200, Fat Burning Express workout plus the guides that go with them.By the way, if you look up my other reviews (over 200, mostly Yoga and Pilates programs) it should be obvious that I have no affiliation w/ Beachbody or Tony Horton. I just wanted to share my thoughts about this program because I believe it's a sound approach to fitness for people who want to be able to get into shape at home very inexpensively.",5,Tony Horton Is The Real Deal!,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,2846,"['used', 'see', 'Power', '90', 'infomercials', 'TV', 'hear', 'testimonials', 'think', 'probably', 'bunch', 'garbage', '.Then', 'online', 'fitness', 'board', ""'ve"", 'been', 'member', 'started', 'hearing', 'several', 'personal', 'trainers', 'using', 'Tony', 'follow', 'up', 'program', 'P90X', 'Also', 'one', 'people', 'board', 'was', 'actually', 'featured', 'P90X', 'infomercial.I', 'figured', 'were', 'true', 'then', 'obviously', 'program', 'was', 'real', 'testimonials', 'were', 'real', 'people', 'also.Anyway', 'did', 'P90X', 'got', 'incredible', 'results', 'now', 'wife', 'doing', 'having', 'same', 'success.As', 'was', 'close', 'finishing', 'P90X', 'rotation', 'decided', 'wanted', 'less', 'intense', 'programs', 'use', 'P90X', 'would', 'help', 'stay', 'fit', 'being', 'as', 'intense', 'P90X', 'so', 'got', 'Power', '90', 'Sculpt', '3-4', 'as', 'well', 'Sweat', '3-4', 'am', 'doing', 'mixed', 'rotation', 'P90X', 'weeks', 'as', 'well', 'Power', '90', 'various', 'other', 'workouts', '.I', ""'ve"", 'got', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Whereas', 'P90X', 'more', 'specialized', 'bodypart', 'workouts', 'Power', '90', 'Sculpt', 'whole', 'body', 'circuit.What', 'nice', 'need', 'almost', 'equipment', 'really', 'just', 'dumbells', 'exercise', 'band', ""'re"", 'ready', 'go.The', 'exercises', 'are', 'basic', 'exercises', 'sequenced', 'such', 'Chest', 'Back', 'Shoulders', 'Biceps', 'Triceps', 'Legs.Anyway', 'real', 'workout', 'nothing', 'fancy', 'job', 'done', 'are', 'willing', 'do', 'work', 'one', 'could', 'certainly', 'design', 'own', 'program', 'nice', 'thing', 'DVD', 'tremendously', 'pacing', 'motivation', 'Tony', 'very', 'funny', 'way', 'thing', 'light', 'still', 'working', 'hard.I', 'have', 'done', 'other', 'Beachbody', 'as', 'well', 'P90X', 'Power', '90', 'Slim', '6', 'Power', 'Half', 'Hour', 'thing', 'are', 'very', 'straightforward', 'terms', 'fact', 'have', 'just', 'eat', 'right', 'work', 'hard', ""'ll"", 'get', 'real', 'results.For', 'folks', 'looking', 'quick', 'fix', 'breaking', 'sweat', 'then', 'NOT', 'are', 'serious', 'really', 'making', 'significant', 'changes', 'body', 'more', 'importantly', 'health', 'then', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'Power', '90', 'said', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'make', 'commitment', 'work', 'hard', 'least', '6', 'days', 'week', 'have', ""n't"", 'worked', 'out', 'while', 'then', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'getting', 'whole', 'set', 'can', 'work', 'up', 'intensity', 'gradually', 'Sculpt', '1-2', '3-4', 'Sweat', '1-2', 'w/', 'Ab', '100', 'Sweat', '3-4', 'w/', 'Ab', '200', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Express', 'guides', 'go', 'way', 'look', 'up', 'other', 'reviews', '200', 'mostly', 'Yoga', 'Pilates', 'programs', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'have', 'affiliation', 'Beachbody', 'Tony', 'Horton', 'just', 'wanted', 'share', 'thoughts', 'program', 'believe', 'sound', 'approach', 'fitness', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'shape', 'home', 'very', 'inexpensively']",N/A
