680954,A2B5038SQTFOZ8,B00005RYQL,Amanda N Morton,"[0, 0]",I love this DVD for meditation as I have tried several that were either too fast or had people leading it with very obnoxious voices. She has a stretching component during the DVD which is great as an after workout stretch or an easy day stretch. I like the backgrounds that they show and the music is soothing.  Its very hard for me to meditate as my mind wants to go 100mph on some days but this DVD helps me to calm/slow down- I'm not perfect at it but this DVD certainly helps.,5,Great for beginners- Maritza has a soothing voice- easy to follow,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,481,"['love', 'DVD', 'meditation', 'have', 'tried', 'several', 'were', 'either', 'too', 'fast', 'had', 'people', 'leading', 'very', 'obnoxious', 'voices', 'stretching', 'component', 'DVD', 'great', 'workout', 'stretch', 'easy', 'day', 'stretch', 'backgrounds', 'show', 'music', 'soothing', 'very', 'hard', 'meditate', 'mind', 'go', '100mph', 'days', 'DVD', 'calm/slow', 'down-', ""'m"", 'not', 'perfect', 'DVD', 'certainly']",N/A

One can do parts 1 & 2 for a 50 minute session, or if one has more time, the full 70 minutes. There is one annoying part to the video-a long introduction before the practice beings: this is easily solved. Just practice fast-forwarding to the correct spot in the DVD/tape.  If you have a DVD/VCR combo (don't know if they still make these) get the video. I just marked in indelible ink on the transparent top of the cassette the spot where the tape should begin, after I'm done, and I'm all set for the next session. Maritza is very appealing.

Why?The first part, the yoga section, is unlike other yoga routines I've done. Martiza's instruction is very inward based and her choice of words takes you to different places with the poses, changing them from a purely physical move to something more in your head. I liked it!The second part, the body imaging section--whoa. I've actually done this before, in a different style without realizing it was a type of meditation in order to help get myself to sleep. Instead, I ended up so relaxed on the floor (not asleep, quite) that I did the rest of the DVD in the same position.After the third section of the DVD, I was so relaxed I was a noodle. Seriously noodle-like. I know I hadn't fallen asleep because when I wake up, I'm never that relaxed.
