1009654,A2VV4JWNKCQHF0,B000H5U5M6,Basbenee,"[2, 2]","I adored the first season so I was curious how this one played out. Season 2, I admit, was pretty damn good, though I do believe Season 1 was better. Still, this series is leagues ahead of most stuff that's out there. Season 2 winds up some strings of Season 1, with Hamlet winding up, some story lines tied up to make room for new plots. Mark McKinney's businessman character finds the theater company in financial trouble after losing a major sponsor (Mark's Richard Smith-Jones slept with someone on the board and when that went kaput so did the funding). So Richard is on the hunt for new revenue and hilariously deals with some huckster agency with some whacked-out nihilistic campaigns. Then Geoffrey Tennant stays on as artistic director and directs Macbeth, partly out of legacy to Oliver Welles, the director who died early Season 1. Oliver was obsessed with Macbeth, so Geoffrey is combing through notes, boxes of them; coping with Oliver's ghost, still determined to direct, however indirectly, Macbeth; and Geoffrey's got people worried he's losing it and ready for another breakdown as they see him talking to air when in fact he's talking to Oliver's ghost. Add to that an arrogant actor playing Macbeth who's basically phoning it in since he's played it three times before, battling Geoffrey along the way. Geoffrey's reunion with his lady love Ellen Fanshawe is on shaky ground as well, so that's complicating things. And add to that the return of Don McKellar (my personal favorite) as Darren Nichols, the director who hates the theatre who wants to direct a post-modern Romeo and Juliet where the actors recite the lines without emotion facing the audience, to the disappointment of the leads. There are a few more twists, a couple more romances, all a lot of fun to watch. The season starts off slower, but once it gets into the thick of things it's well worth the time, especially the finale, where it's a blast to watch how everything gets resolved. And after watching it again, it gets even better, because there's so much to absorb. Satisfying stuff! I can only say I hope Season 3 is not the last season ... as I've heard that it may be. I'm hoping they'll come back and tackle Othello.",5,Milk of human brilliance,1173830400,"03 14, 2007",2007,2210,"['adored', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'was', 'curious', 'how', 'one', 'played', 'out', 'Season', '2', 'admit', 'was', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'do', 'believe', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'better', 'Still', 'series', 'leagues', 'ahead', 'most', 'stuff', 'out', 'there', 'Season', '2', 'up', 'strings', 'Season', '1', 'Hamlet', 'winding', 'up', 'story', 'lines', 'tied', 'up', 'make', 'room', 'new', 'plots', 'Mark', 'McKinney', 'businessman', 'character', 'theater', 'company', 'financial', 'trouble', 'losing', 'major', 'sponsor', 'Mark', 'Richard', 'Smith-Jones', 'slept', 'someone', 'board', 'when', 'went', 'kaput', 'so', 'did', 'funding', 'So', 'Richard', 'hunt', 'new', 'revenue', 'hilariously', 'deals', 'huckster', 'agency', 'whacked-out', 'nihilistic', 'campaigns', 'Then', 'Geoffrey', 'Tennant', 'artistic', 'director', 'directs', 'Macbeth', 'partly', 'legacy', 'Oliver', 'Welles', 'director', 'who', 'died', 'early', 'Season', '1', 'Oliver', 'was', 'obsessed', 'Macbeth', 'so', 'Geoffrey', 'combing', 'notes', 'boxes', 'coping', 'Oliver', 'ghost', 'still', 'determined', 'direct', 'however', 'indirectly', 'Macbeth', 'Geoffrey', 'got', 'people', 'worried', 'losing', 'ready', 'breakdown', 'see', 'talking', 'air', 'when', 'fact', 'talking', 'Oliver', 'ghost', 'Add', 'arrogant', 'actor', 'playing', 'Macbeth', 'who', 'basically', 'phoning', 'played', 'three', 'times', 'battling', 'Geoffrey', 'way', 'Geoffrey', 'reunion', 'lady', 'love', 'Ellen', 'Fanshawe', 'shaky', 'ground', 'well', 'complicating', 'things', 'add', 'return', 'Don', 'McKellar', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Darren', 'Nichols', 'director', 'who', 'theatre', 'who', 'direct', 'post-modern', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'where', 'actors', 'recite', 'lines', 'emotion', 'facing', 'audience', 'disappointment', 'leads', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'twists', 'couple', 'more', 'romances', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'season', 'slower', 'once', 'thick', 'things', 'well', 'time', 'especially', 'finale', 'where', 'blast', 'watch', 'how', 'everything', 'resolved', 'watching', 'again', 'even', 'better', 'so', 'much', 'absorb', 'Satisfying', 'stuff', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'hope', 'Season', '3', 'not', 'last', 'season', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'may', 'be', ""'m"", 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'come', 'back', 'tackle', 'Othello']",N/A

Subsequently, some of them are wrapped up in hasty, unconvincing ways.  Personally, I would have preferred some juicy cliffhangers going into Season 3.

What in the end sets this show apart is the uniformly superb acting. We thought, perhaps, that the first season's ensemble was thrown together by chance but, no, there are geniuses at work here. As a result, we have that rarest of rarities, the perfect second season. No doubt, Canadians have come to expect this kind of thing, namely, wit, intelligence, grace, and subtlety, but here in the States, these features left television long ago. Our shows about thugs and killers have, it must be said, grown more sophisticated, but our comedies have fallen to the lowest possible level, besides possessing the fatalist of all flaws: they are not in the least funny.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","According to theatre superstitions, ""Macbeth"" is cursed -- and since everything in New Burbage appears to be cursed anyway, you know things are gonna go south. ""Slings and Arrows Season 2"" is a joyously strange return to the world of Shakespearean plays and disastrous theatrical matters, this time centering around the infamous Scottish play.""Hamlet"" is over for the season, and things are seemingly looking up for Geoffrey -- especially when Ellen dumps her teenage lover and reunites with him. But there's a fly in the ointment: he's expected to put on ""Macbeth,"" which he doesn't want to.And he starts running into troubles right away -- eight boxes of production notes, new interns, financial woes, a disrespectful diva as the lead, and the ""Romeo and Juliet"" director falling off the stage and breaking her neck. What's more, Oliver's ghost has made a reappearance, and he's determined to have Geoffrey put on the infamous Scottish play properly -- only to have things spin out of control yet again.And other theatre people have problems as well: Ellen is being audited, and Darren Nichols (Don McKellar) returns to take over ""Romeo And Juliet,"" and promptly turns it into a passionless avant-garde affair. Most importantly, Richard's attempts to keep their finances stable blows up in his face when he signs up for an edgy, controversial ad campaign -- and ends up alienating EVERYBODY. Is it the end for the New Burbage theatre?""Slings and Arrows Season 2"" is a slightly more cheerful affair than the first season, mainly because most of the bitterness has been exorcised and Geoffrey is now firmly entrenched as artistic director. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't have its fair share of grim moments (poor Richard almost has a nervous breakdown -- and a very creepy dream sequence involving an axe).The writers deftly juggle the various plot threads and eventually weave them together for the grand finale, when everything somehow comes together in time for the new season. And the entire series is imbued with plenty of dry, witty humor (""Oliver Welles is dead! I poured him in the river and swans ate him!"") and humorous moments (the distinctive ""look"" for Romeo and Juliet involves metal cages and chess hats).But there are a few flaws -- the resolution of the ""Disaster Ad Campaign"" plot feels rather contrived, and there's a random scene where Ellen sleeps with her brother-in-law. Who knows why?Martha Burns and Paul Gross are actually better than in the first season, mainly because Geoffrey and Ellen are now a couple living together (most of the time) and running into some problems separating their personal and professional life. Stephen Ouimette remains deliciously dry and funny as Oliver; David Alpay and Joanne Kelly are adorable as the young lovers in ""Romeo and Juliet"" -- onstage and off. Turns out... he's not gay.While it has some potholes along the way, ""Slings and Arrows Season 2"" is a fun revisit to the world of sets, stages and disastrous plays.

But will she have to give up her dream because of her love affair with a handsome and talented young action star of Hollywood movies?Oddly enough it's like having a second ""sixth episode"" to Season One, and thus most of the second series is crammed into five episodes.  Geoffrey is now fulfilling Oliver's dream of directing Macbeth, and there's a curse on it called Henry Breedlove, apparently Canada's most acclaimed actor but a horror to work with, vain and capricious and totally up his own fundament.  Geoffrey however has a few tricks up his sleeve to get the sort of performance he needs from this ham of hams.A secondary story has the wonderful Darren Nichols come back to direct the New Burbage Festival's Romeo and Juliet.  This story is spoiled somewhat by the inadequate actors SLINGS found to play Sarah and Patrick, but their situation (he's gay, she's straight, but such is the power of the poetry that they fall in love with each other) is so inanely written that Lunt and Fontanne couldn't have saved it.

1009664,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000H5U5M6,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[24, 24]","If anyone had told me a year ago that my favorite program on television would be a Canadian import about a Shakespearean theater troupe, I would have had my doubts.  But Season 1 of ""Slings and Arrows"" beguiled me.  So droll and sophisticated, but with moments of sheer slapstick, I was absolutely enchanted.  The writing was so smart, so funny, the performances spot on--including Paul Gross and Rachel McAdams (two of the more familiar actors for American audiences).  It ended in six episodes and I wistfully said good-bye to a near brilliant show.  I had no idea there was more to come.So I was delighted when I heard Season 2 was on it's way.  But I was also doubtful.  Could they really mine the same material and come up with another winner?  To my mind, they did that and even more.  I enjoyed it every bit as much.This season there was less back story, so it dealt more specifically about the inner workings of actually staging a couple of shows.  The misadventures of producing the cursed ""MacBeth"" is definitely the highpoint.  It might have been the funniest thing on TV last season, seriously.  Add subplots about theater ingenues in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (McAdams says farewell in episode 1, so there's a new ingenue), a romance found/lost/found,  and plenty of wit--and you have a delight.  One subplot about an experimental advertising campaign to lure new traffic to the theater festival is perfection.  As someone who has been a season subscriber in the LA theater scene for over ten years, this was particularly hysterical to me--how much truth there was.But, trust me, you don't have to be a theater goer or a Shakespeare enthusiast to enjoy this program.

Like those of us with a background in the theater, I fell in love with the New Burbage Theatre Festival and its madman artistic director Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross).  If his bouts with mental problems were not enough, Geoffrey is saddled with a leading lady, Ellen Fanshaw (Martha Burns), who is his once (and perhaps future) girl friend and the ghost of Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette), his predecessor whose sudden death got him his current gig.  The first season was all about staging ""Hamlet"" with a television star as the melancholy Dane, while the second season finds Geoffrey tackling the Scottish play (hence the title song, ""Mackers,"" quoted above).  But Geoffrey is running around dealing with not only Oliver's ghost and all those notebooks his predecessor left behind about directing the play, which gives plenty of time for the associated curse to wreck some havoc.The good news is that when we get to the second half of the season on the second DVD, ""Slings & Arrows"" is totally back on track, but a bit too late to deserve the same 5 star rating as Season 1.  That is because in the final three episodes we finally get deep into the staging of the play in question, as Geoffrey finally makes a connection to the play and connects with the play and then has to find a way to persuade if not coerce his lead, the ego maniacal Henry Breedlove (Geraint Wyn Davies) in to following his direction.  The best moments are when Geoffrey gets us to see the play anew.  Ironically, at the same time the Festival is putting on ""Romeo & Juliet,"" directed by Darren Nichols (Don McKellar), who is actually back again.  Nicholas antipathy for the play is such that he is trying to present the play devoid of all romance to the stunned displeasure of his leads, Sarah (Joanne Kelly) and Patrick (David Alpay).  So we have two plays where the director and cast disagree on the performance and for the most part the wrong side is winning the argument, which is somewhat maddening.  Especially when who is right and who is wrong on each stage is so absolutely clear, but the great cosmic joke for Season 2 just because people do what you want and just because you are right, does not mean that they are ever going to admit that you were right despite ample evidence proving the point.Of course there are other things going on at New Burbage to keep everyone occupied.  The Festival is having massive financial problems and as a last resort Richard Smith-Jones (Mark McKinney) has hired an advertising guru, Sanjay (Colm Feore) who promises a ""youth quake"" as the result of a bizarre ad campaign that goes out of its way to offend current subscribers.  Meanwhile, Ellen is being audited and Anna (Susan Coyne) has caught the eye of a visiting playwright, much to her surprise.  But if you know Shakespeare then you know the play is the thing, and it is not until we get to the Scottish play that ""Slings & Arrows"" is back in high gear, although what is happening with the other play has some interesting moments.  Now we have to wait for Season 3 to come out on DVD, it appears that the first line of the final stanza of the opening song sets up what we have to look forward to in the final season:So gimme King LearCleopatraRomeo, JulietDoesn't mattraI'll play them all for freeBut I'd be crackersTo take on MackersYou see, I'm skittish about the Scottish tragedy",4,Geoffrey and the New Burbage gang take on the Scottish play,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,3946,"['Call', 'superstitious', 'cowardly', 'weakBut', ""'ll"", 'never', 'play', 'characterWhose', 'name', 'one', 'dare', 'not', 'speakI', ""'ll"", 'play', 'HamletIn', 'doublet', 'hoseOr', 'DromeosBut', 'sorry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'MackersI', ""'ll"", 'play', 'Richard', 'ThirdWith', 'hump', 'wigOr', 'Henry', 'EighthThat', 'selfish', 'pigBut', 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'MackersEvery', 'soul', 'who', 'roleRisks', 'injury', 'deathI', ""'d"", 'rather', 'sweep', 'bloody', 'stageThen', 'ever', 'doMac-you-know-whoWhen', 'watched', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'Season', '2', 'Slings', 'Arrows', 'first', 'two', 'DVDS', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'series', 'background', 'theater', 'fell', 'love', 'New', 'Burbage', 'Theatre', 'Festival', 'madman', 'artistic', 'director', 'Geoffrey', 'Tennant', 'Paul', 'Gross', 'bouts', 'mental', 'problems', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'Geoffrey', 'saddled', 'leading', 'lady', 'Ellen', 'Fanshaw', 'Martha', 'Burns', 'who', 'once', 'perhaps', 'future', 'girl', 'friend', 'ghost', 'Oliver', 'Welles', 'Stephen', 'Ouimette', 'predecessor', 'sudden', 'death', 'got', 'current', 'gig', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'staging', 'Hamlet', 'television', 'star', 'melancholy', 'Dane', 'second', 'season', 'Geoffrey', 'tackling', 'Scottish', 'play', 'hence', 'title', 'song', 'Mackers', 'quoted', 'Geoffrey', 'running', 'around', 'dealing', 'not', 'only', 'Oliver', 'ghost', 'predecessor', 'left', 'behind', 'directing', 'play', 'plenty', 'time', 'associated', 'curse', 'wreck', 'havoc.The', 'good', 'news', 'when', 'get', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'second', 'DVD', 'Slings', 'Arrows', 'totally', 'back', 'track', 'bit', 'too', 'late', 'deserve', 'same', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'Season', '1', 'because', 'final', 'three', 'finally', 'get', 'deep', 'staging', 'play', 'question', 'Geoffrey', 'finally', 'connection', 'play', 'connects', 'play', 'then', 'find', 'way', 'persuade', 'not', 'coerce', 'lead', 'ego', 'maniacal', 'Henry', 'Breedlove', 'Geraint', 'Wyn', 'Davies', 'following', 'direction', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'Geoffrey', 'see', 'play', 'anew', 'Ironically', 'same', 'time', 'Festival', 'putting', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'directed', 'Darren', 'Nichols', 'Don', 'McKellar', 'who', 'actually', 'back', 'again', 'Nicholas', 'antipathy', 'play', 'such', 'trying', 'present', 'play', 'devoid', 'romance', 'stunned', 'displeasure', 'leads', 'Sarah', 'Joanne', 'Kelly', 'Patrick', 'David', 'Alpay', 'have', 'two', 'plays', 'where', 'director', 'cast', 'disagree', 'performance', 'most', 'part', 'wrong', 'side', 'winning', 'argument', 'somewhat', 'maddening', 'Especially', 'when', 'who', 'right', 'who', 'wrong', 'stage', 'so', 'absolutely', 'clear', 'great', 'cosmic', 'joke', 'Season', '2', 'just', 'people', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'just', 'are', 'right', 'not', 'mean', 'are', 'ever', 'going', 'admit', 'were', 'right', 'ample', 'evidence', 'proving', 'point.Of', 'course', 'are', 'other', 'things', 'going', 'New', 'Burbage', 'keep', 'everyone', 'occupied', 'Festival', 'having', 'massive', 'financial', 'problems', 'last', 'resort', 'Richard', 'Smith-Jones', 'Mark', 'McKinney', 'hired', 'advertising', 'guru', 'Sanjay', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'who', 'youth', 'quake', 'result', 'bizarre', 'ad', 'campaign', 'way', 'offend', 'current', 'subscribers', 'Meanwhile', 'Ellen', 'being', 'audited', 'Anna', 'Susan', 'Coyne', 'caught', 'eye', 'visiting', 'playwright', 'much', 'surprise', 'know', 'Shakespeare', 'then', 'know', 'play', 'thing', 'not', 'get', 'Scottish', 'play', 'Slings', 'Arrows', 'back', 'high', 'gear', 'what', 'happening', 'other', 'play', 'interesting', 'moments', 'Now', 'have', 'wait', 'Season', '3', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'first', 'line', 'final', 'stanza', 'opening', 'song', 'up', 'what', 'have', 'look', 'forward', 'final', 'season', 'So', 'gim', 'King', 'LearCleopatraRomeo', 'JulietDoes', ""n't"", 'mattraI', ""'ll"", 'play', 'freeBut', ""'d"", 'be', 'crackersTo', 'take', 'MackersYou', 'see', ""'m"", 'skittish', 'Scottish', 'tragedy']",N/A

For those of you who don't know, ""MacBeth"" is a name that's not often heard inside a theatre--the cast and crew are afraid to say the name.  In Scotland, you just don't say the name anywhere--so, it's billed as ""The Scottish Play.""  And I bet you just thought that being owned by a black cat or having an address or phone number with the number 13 in it was bad.Up til this minute, the funniest take on ""Mackers"" I have ever encountered was Adam McNaughtan's ""The Scottish Song"", which boils the plot of the play down to 4 minutes---or less.  Leave it to the ""Slings and Arrows"" to go for the extended play.Here's just a bit of what happens for Season Two--onstage and off.Richard Smith-Jones, the General Manager, hires a new advertising guru to help boost ticket sales for the New Burbage Festival.  Sanjay has an unfortunate propensity to quote Richard Nixon--and is in many ways, a better actor than some of the cast!Ellen, our leading lady, is audited by the Canadian tax system.  This lady's so unprepared and unaware that she thinks Christmas presents should be a business expense.Geoffrey, our mad artistic director, thinks he's on his own with MacBeth, but Oliver Welles comes back.  This is, after all, his play and his dream, and he wants Geoff to get it right.Then, there's the playwright Lionel Train, who takes metafiction to a new low.Of course, there's more.  What makes ""Slings and Arrows"" so fascinating is the interwoven nature of the play and the theatre cast.  The show's amusing and literate and is far too short.

1009671,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000H5U5M6,Robert Moore,"[7, 7]","As fine as Season One of this truly wonderful series was, Season Two was, in my opinion, even better.  The series takes us even deeper into the characters, sharpens the humor, thickens the plot, and delves even more deeply into Shakespeare than in Season One.  Viewing Season One did not make me want to rush out and read HAMLET, but Season Two did make me rush out to read MACBETH.This ability to multitask is what makes SLINGS AND ARROWS such a wonderful series.  It manages to do several things on several different levels remarkably well.  I've read several books on Shakespeare, including those by Stephen Greenblatt, Peter Levi, and Stanley Cavell, as well as the wonderful prefaces by Samuel Johnson, but I can honestly say that I got as much insight from many wonderful little moments in this series as in any of those.  Cavell is brilliant, but some of his essays are so far removed from the play that I'm not sure what work of art he is discussing (I'm reminded of somebody's--I'm not sure who--comment about James Agee's film criticism that it takes you directly into the heart of a film; Cavell is brilliant, but I never felt Shakespeare's pulse reading him).As funny as the show was in Season One, it got even funnier in Season Two.  The bits about the ""rebranding"" firm Frog and Hammer are among the funniest things I've ever seen on TV.  I always enjoy Colm Feore, but his turn as Sanjay, the head of Frog and Hammer, is the best thing I've ever seen him do.  The twists and turns of his character are simply brilliant.The backstage drama is even more engrossing, as Geoffrey ""collaborates"" with Oliver in staging a version of MACBETH based on the latter's design for the play.  The collaboration consists not merely of Geoffrey pouring over Oliver's notes, but through long conversations with Oliver's ghost.  The writing is sharper than ever with wonderful parallels between what is happening in the play (inside the play) and the events in the various characters' lives.  Each of the three seasons features some difficulty with the lead actor (Season One with a Hollywood star playing the title role in HAMLET; Season Three with a dying actor in the role of LEAR).  This year Henry Breedlove (played by Geraint Wyn Davies, perhaps most familiar from his recent appearance on 24 and as the vampire detective in FOREVER KNIGHT) is a distinguished stage actor who has played Macbeth before and sees no reason to play the role any differently than he has before.  Geoffrey's task is to shake him up and make him bring some life to the role, to take some risks instead of doing the same old thing.The great misfortune with SLINGS AND ARROWS is that we only got three seasons and a total of 18 episodes.  But perhaps it is as good as it is because they deliberately limited how much they did.  FAWLTY TOWERS is frequently considered the finest comedy series ever (the BBC did a poll on the finest BBC series ever and it snagged the Number One slot).  But it was limited to only 12 half hour episodes.  Perhaps it is a lesson that more networks could learn that sometimes less truly is more.",5,An already superb series gets even better,1177372800,"04 24, 2007",2007,3102,"['As', 'fine', 'Season', 'One', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'series', 'was', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'opinion', 'even', 'better', 'series', 'even', 'deeper', 'characters', 'humor', 'plot', 'even', 'more', 'deeply', 'Shakespeare', 'Season', 'One', 'Viewing', 'Season', 'One', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'want', 'rush', 'out', 'read', 'HAMLET', 'Season', 'Two', 'did', 'make', 'rush', 'out', 'read', 'MACBETH.This', 'ability', 'multitask', 'what', 'SLINGS', 'AND', 'ARROWS', 'wonderful', 'series', 'do', 'several', 'things', 'several', 'different', 'levels', 'remarkably', 'well', ""'ve"", 'read', 'several', 'books', 'Shakespeare', 'including', 'Stephen', 'Greenblatt', 'Peter', 'Levi', 'Stanley', 'Cavell', 'as', 'well', 'wonderful', 'prefaces', 'Samuel', 'Johnson', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'got', 'as', 'much', 'insight', 'many', 'wonderful', 'little', 'moments', 'series', 'Cavell', 'brilliant', 'essays', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'play', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'work', 'art', 'discussing', ""'m"", 'reminded', 'somebody', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'comment', 'James', 'Agee', 'film', 'criticism', 'directly', 'heart', 'film', 'Cavell', 'brilliant', 'never', 'felt', 'Shakespeare', 'pulse', 'reading', '.As', 'funny', 'show', 'was', 'Season', 'One', 'got', 'even', 'funnier', 'Season', 'Two', 'bits', 'rebranding', 'firm', 'Frog', 'Hammer', 'are', 'funniest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'always', 'enjoy', 'Colm', 'Feore', 'turn', 'Sanjay', 'head', 'Frog', 'Hammer', 'best', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'do', 'twists', 'turns', 'character', 'are', 'simply', 'brilliant.The', 'backstage', 'drama', 'even', 'more', 'engrossing', 'Geoffrey', 'collaborates', 'Oliver', 'staging', 'version', 'MACBETH', 'based', 'latter', 'design', 'play', 'collaboration', 'not', 'merely', 'Geoffrey', 'pouring', 'over', 'Oliver', 'notes', 'long', 'conversations', 'Oliver', 'ghost', 'writing', 'sharper', 'ever', 'wonderful', 'parallels', 'what', 'happening', 'play', 'play', 'events', 'various', 'characters', 'lives', 'three', 'seasons', 'difficulty', 'lead', 'actor', 'Season', 'One', 'Hollywood', 'star', 'playing', 'title', 'role', 'HAMLET', 'Season', 'Three', 'dying', 'actor', 'role', 'LEAR', 'year', 'Henry', 'Breedlove', 'played', 'Geraint', 'Wyn', 'Davies', 'perhaps', 'most', 'familiar', 'recent', 'appearance', '24', 'vampire', 'detective', 'FOREVER', 'KNIGHT', 'distinguished', 'stage', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Macbeth', 'reason', 'play', 'role', 'differently', 'before', 'Geoffrey', 'task', 'shake', 'up', 'make', 'bring', 'life', 'role', 'take', 'risks', 'instead', 'doing', 'same', 'old', 'thing.The', 'great', 'misfortune', 'SLINGS', 'AND', 'ARROWS', 'only', 'got', 'three', 'seasons', 'total', '18', 'episodes', 'perhaps', 'as', 'good', 'deliberately', 'limited', 'how', 'much', 'did', 'FAWLTY', 'TOWERS', 'frequently', 'considered', 'finest', 'comedy', 'series', 'ever', 'BBC', 'did', 'poll', 'finest', 'BBC', 'series', 'ever', 'snagged', 'Number', 'One', 'slot', 'was', 'limited', 'only', '12', 'half', 'hour', 'episodes', 'Perhaps', 'lesson', 'more', 'networks', 'could', 'learn', 'sometimes', 'less', 'truly', 'more']",N/A
