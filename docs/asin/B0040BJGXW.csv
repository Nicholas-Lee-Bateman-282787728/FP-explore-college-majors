It is in fact a DVD-R and can be purchased directly from Warner Brothers for under twenty dollars.Sally was made at the very end of 1929, and it is impressive to see how far sound technology has come in just one year. Although this film still used the Vitaphone sound on disc system that usually resulted in very static scenes, Sally has a high amount of fluid motion present that is uncharacteristic for a film made at this time. Sally's film elements are in somewhat shaggy shape, as is true of many of the early talking First National films. However, it is a very good and rare record of the singing, dancing, and even acting talents of Marilyn Miller and a very good musical in its own rights.The story is adapted from the Ziegfeld show of the same name. It is about Sally Green (Marilyn Miller), an orphaned girl who waitresses and cooks in a diner for a living, but dreams of being a professional dancer. In fact, the very first shots of the film are of Miller's feet as she dances while she works. She also has an admirer (Alexander Grey) who stares at her from outside the caf&eacute; where she works, causing her to get so enthralled in his gaze one day that she inadvertently makes the world's largest pancake. Sally is basically a Cinderella story, and a charming one at that. There is no evil stepmother in this fairy tale, however, so you can just sit back and enjoy this light romantic comedy and its beautiful musical numbers. The romance is provided by Alexander Gray and Marilyn Miller, and the comedy is mainly provided by Joe E. Brown. Brown plays a prince made penniless by a revolution in his country of origin who now works at the restaurant with Sally and is also her good friend. One of the most delightful scenes in the film is where the two dance to ""Look for the Silver Lining"" with Miller doing her more formal interpretation alongside Brown's eccentric dancing.Marilyn Miller has been compared to Irene Dunne, and there is one scene where that is particularly true. An agent has a famous dancer client who has run out on him the night before she is to perform at a big society party. Sally helps him out by impersonating that dancer complete with a ridiculous accent and an outlandish headdress. This comedy bit very much reminded me of something Irene Dunne would do.The film was originally shot in two-strip Technicolor, but only one color scene still exists that is under three minutes long. That one scene is Miller dancing to ""Wild Rose"" at a society party, and the colors there are truly splendid. As soon as the Technicolor kicks in, for some reason, so does a higher quality level on the sound. This color scene is included on this DVD-R version.The DVD-R of this film has not been restored at all. It has been several years since Sally made an appearance on TCM, and its video was scratched up then and it still is in this release. However, the audio is pretty good except for the hiss of the Vitaphone. Highly recommended for the fans of the early talkie musicals, just don't expect a cleaned up film.",4,A Cinderella story for the Jazz age,1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,3074,"['Warner', 'Archive', 'product', 'fact', 'DVD-R', 'can', 'be', 'purchased', 'directly', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'twenty', 'dollars.Sally', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'end', '1929', 'impressive', 'see', 'how', 'far', 'sound', 'technology', 'come', 'just', 'one', 'year', 'film', 'still', 'used', 'Vitaphone', 'sound', 'disc', 'system', 'usually', 'resulted', 'very', 'static', 'scenes', 'Sally', 'high', 'amount', 'fluid', 'motion', 'present', 'uncharacteristic', 'film', 'made', 'time', 'Sally', 'film', 'elements', 'are', 'somewhat', 'shaggy', 'shape', 'true', 'many', 'early', 'talking', 'First', 'National', 'films', 'However', 'very', 'good', 'rare', 'record', 'singing', 'dancing', 'even', 'acting', 'talents', 'Marilyn', 'Miller', 'very', 'good', 'musical', 'own', 'rights.The', 'story', 'adapted', 'Ziegfeld', 'show', 'same', 'name', 'Sally', 'Green', 'Marilyn', 'Miller', 'orphaned', 'girl', 'who', 'diner', 'living', 'dreams', 'being', 'professional', 'dancer', 'fact', 'very', 'first', 'shots', 'film', 'are', 'Miller', 'feet', 'also', 'admirer', 'Alexander', 'Grey', 'who', 'caf', 'eacute', 'where', 'causing', 'get', 'so', 'enthralled', 'gaze', 'one', 'day', 'inadvertently', 'world', 'largest', 'pancake', 'Sally', 'basically', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'charming', 'one', 'evil', 'stepmother', 'fairy', 'tale', 'however', 'can', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'beautiful', 'musical', 'numbers', 'romance', 'provided', 'Alexander', 'Gray', 'Marilyn', 'Miller', 'comedy', 'mainly', 'provided', 'Joe', 'E.', 'Brown', 'Brown', 'prince', 'made', 'penniless', 'revolution', 'country', 'origin', 'who', 'now', 'restaurant', 'Sally', 'also', 'good', 'friend', 'One', 'most', 'delightful', 'scenes', 'film', 'where', 'two', 'dance', 'Look', 'Silver', 'Lining', 'Miller', 'doing', 'more', 'formal', 'interpretation', 'Brown', 'eccentric', 'dancing.Marilyn', 'Miller', 'been', 'compared', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'particularly', 'true', 'agent', 'famous', 'dancer', 'client', 'who', 'run', 'out', 'night', 'perform', 'big', 'society', 'party', 'Sally', 'out', 'impersonating', 'dancer', 'complete', 'ridiculous', 'accent', 'outlandish', 'headdress', 'comedy', 'bit', 'very', 'much', 'reminded', 'something', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'would', 'do.The', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'two-strip', 'Technicolor', 'only', 'one', 'color', 'scene', 'still', 'three', 'minutes', 'long', 'one', 'scene', 'Miller', 'dancing', 'Wild', 'Rose', 'society', 'party', 'colors', 'are', 'truly', 'splendid', 'As', 'soon', 'Technicolor', 'kicks', 'reason', 'so', 'higher', 'quality', 'level', 'sound', 'color', 'scene', 'included', 'DVD-R', 'version.The', 'DVD-R', 'film', 'not', 'been', 'restored', 'been', 'several', 'years', 'Sally', 'made', 'appearance', 'TCM', 'video', 'was', 'scratched', 'up', 'then', 'still', 'release', 'However', 'audio', 'pretty', 'good', 'hiss', 'Vitaphone', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'early', 'talkie', 'musicals', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'cleaned', 'up', 'film']",N/A
1379073,A3FMHXRM9FDR5N,B0040BJGXW,"Cynthia Brideson ""A disillusioned intellectual""","[2, 2]","This film is based on the stage play of the same title produced by the legendary Florenz Ziegfeld. Though it is impossible to recreate his spectacular production in film, this movie does an excellent job in giving viewers a taste of what the orginal play was like. Especially opulent are the elaborate dance sequences (Wild Rose, which is the only surviving Technicolor sequence, and the Butterfly Ballet, which includes the whimsical, dream-like costumes Ziegfeld shows were so famous for). Many of the Jerome Kern songs from the play are omitted in the film, but most are included. The highlight song is the classic ""Look For the Silver Lining."" Marilyn Miller made it her own and hearing her sing the song, whose lyrics are so full of hope and innocence, in her sweet, tremulous soprano is enough to bring tears to your eyes. The film's plot is a classic Cinderella story, but though formulaic, it is a storyline that never grows old. Aside from the beatuiful sets and score, the stars of the film are what really make it a classic. Marilyn Miller's performance as a naive, dreamy orphan and her carefree style of dance truly transport the viewer to the fancy free feeling of the 1920s. Joe E. Brown is hilarious as a downtrodden prince who has to work as a waiter. Especially amusing is a scene when Joe tries to help an old man into a treehouse type of seat at a restaurant, only to have him repeatedly almost fall. It is classic slapstick, screwball humor! This movie is an excellent example of the best early talkies had to offer. It gives us a chance to see some of the most celebrated stage stars (Marilyn Miller) and their sincere performances leave no question as to why they were so beloved in their own time as well as our time.",5,A Glimpse into Ziegfeld's World,1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,1741,"['film', 'based', 'stage', 'play', 'same', 'title', 'produced', 'legendary', 'Florenz', 'Ziegfeld', 'impossible', 'recreate', 'spectacular', 'production', 'film', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'giving', 'viewers', 'taste', 'what', 'orginal', 'play', 'was', 'Especially', 'opulent', 'are', 'elaborate', 'dance', 'sequences', 'Wild', 'Rose', 'only', 'surviving', 'Technicolor', 'sequence', 'Butterfly', 'Ballet', 'whimsical', 'dream-like', 'costumes', 'Ziegfeld', 'shows', 'were', 'so', 'famous', 'Many', 'Jerome', 'Kern', 'songs', 'play', 'are', 'omitted', 'film', 'most', 'are', 'included', 'highlight', 'song', 'classic', 'Look', 'Silver', 'Lining', 'Marilyn', 'Miller', 'made', 'own', 'hearing', 'sing', 'song', 'lyrics', 'are', 'so', 'full', 'hope', 'innocence', 'sweet', 'tremulous', 'soprano', 'enough', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'film', 'plot', 'classic', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'formulaic', 'storyline', 'never', 'old', 'Aside', 'beatuiful', 'sets', 'score', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'make', 'classic', 'Marilyn', 'Miller', 'performance', 'naive', 'dreamy', 'orphan', 'carefree', 'style', 'dance', 'truly', 'transport', 'viewer', 'fancy', 'free', 'feeling', '1920s', 'Joe', 'E.', 'Brown', 'hilarious', 'downtrodden', 'prince', 'who', 'work', 'waiter', 'Especially', 'amusing', 'scene', 'when', 'Joe', 'help', 'old', 'man', 'treehouse', 'type', 'seat', 'restaurant', 'only', 'have', 'repeatedly', 'almost', 'fall', 'classic', 'slapstick', 'screwball', 'humor', 'movie', 'excellent', 'example', 'best', 'early', 'talkies', 'had', 'offer', 'chance', 'see', 'most', 'celebrated', 'stage', 'stars', 'Marilyn', 'Miller', 'sincere', 'performances', 'leave', 'question', 'why', 'were', 'so', 'beloved', 'own', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'time']",N/A
