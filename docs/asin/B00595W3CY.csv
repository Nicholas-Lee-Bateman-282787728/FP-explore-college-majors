1447775,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00595W3CY,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","This was probably meant to be a high octane action flick.  What we got was a BIC lighter that is running out of fuel.  There's enough to spark my entertainment, but it doesn't go very far.  This parkour movie stars Sean Faris.  Faris has an unfortunate film career recently including The King of Fighters (2010).  His highest point to date was in Never Back Down (2008).This freerunning-flick follows the subculture of capture-the-flag racing competitors who operate under the radar of the law for winner-take-all paydays.  They essentially freerun around the city, gather three flags, and hit the finish line for victory.  However, there aren't really any rules, so the occasional skirmish occurs.  The competitiveness, the older guy who runs the show, and the taunts between freerunners make this feel like a parkour-esque Step Up or You Got Served.  There's the underdog star, his overprotective love interest, his crappy job, his loving grandparent, and the reigning champ that everybody hates...it's a cookie-cutter plot.  Our hero bets all he has on himself for one last race so that he, his girl and his grandfather can move out of the city and be happy.  This attempt to follow the dance-movie formula fails to maintain my interest.  But that's just the first chunk of the flick.  It gets better.In the middle of this big race all of the freerunners are captured by some enterprising villain who does exactly what they were already doing--he airs a high betting stakes parkour race for rich people to place bets.  The catch is that they have 60 minutes to finish the race and they all have been fitted with explosive collars which turn their heads into party-poppers after those 60 minutes are up.  There are some other rules to follow to avoid death as well.  So they must literally race as if their lives depended on it.  It's very Death Race meets The Condemned in terms of how their captor manages his web-based betting operation.  Additionally, for no reason whatsoever, their captor offers one million dollars to the winner.  Isn't racing for your life enough?  Maybe the writers just needed to keep the possibility of a happy ending for our protagonist.As a funny bit of added flavor and rather contrary to Death Race and The Condemned, their enterprising captor is a lot like a book club party host.  It's ""his turn"" to host.  Next time, one of the others would be in charge of choosing the type of game and the unwilling participants.  The club members, along with most of the delivery of this movie, are all very hokey.  But it's all in good fun and it's rather entertaining.  Really.The biggest problem with this flick (ignoring the writing and acting) is that following freerunners is difficult, so there is a lot of shaky camera work and FPS-style head-cam shots.  The stunts are cool, but would be more enjoyable with steadier filming.  More solid examples of parkour in film (in order of increasing awesomeness) include Scott Adkins in The Tournament (2009), the French guy from Live Free or Die Hard (2007), and the epic opening chase scene in District B-13 (2004).  Let's also not forget that basically every Jackie Chan movie doubles as a freerunning movie.  And Jackie has the best resume in the business.  But I digress.Freerunner is a bit of mindless fun for a Sunday afternoon.  Just expect nothing and tell yourself this was not meant to be taken seriously.",2,It's meant to be high octane.

1447776,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00595W3CY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","Has the world been clamoring for a movie about parkour or freerunning, an acrobatic style of moving through areas densely populated with obstacles? There is no doubt that since its inception in France, the FreeRunning movement has been gaining traction in some urban markets--but can you really make a movie about it? Or perhaps the better question is, should you? Whatever the answer may be, we've got ""Freerunner."" I'm going to be particularly blunt in my evaluation of ""Freerunner"" as a movie. With amateur theatrics, nonsensical plotting, blatant errors in continuity and timing, and head-scratching dialogue--the movie is a bizarre disaster. Feel free to call me names now. But with some well choreographed sequences, does it achieve what it set out to do? Probably. I doubt anyone here really thought they were serving up a new classic, they were only interested in showcasing Freerunning as a phenomenon. As such, certain action segments are quite successful.The movie's so-called plot revolves around an established group of racing freerunners fronted by a low-level hood. Sean Faris, playing an idealist hoping to establish his new life, bets everything on what he hopes will be his last race. The movie begins as the race progresses with jumping, fighting, and general mayhem. But things take a sinister turn. I actually would not reveal the plot development that transforms the movie at the 30 minute mark--it is the film's biggest moment. But any surprise has already been destroyed by the film's marketing, product description, and DVD cover. So, I'll be vague and say that the race turns into a scramble for life itself as unscrupulous billionaires hijack the proceedings for inhuman sport. The rest is a fairly entertaining, fairly brainless race to the finish. Who will survive?Here's the real deal, though. I'm not sure if I think ""Freerunner"" is just bad or if it is gloriously and brilliantly bad catapulting it to a whole other level worthy of respect. It really does border on being a possible camp classic. Here are some highlights:The Good:Good choreography--racing and fightingExplosionsThe Bad:Faris' awkward narration about friendship that opens and closes the movieRebecca da Costa's brutally wooden performance as Faris' girlfriendThe most ridiculous batch of billionaires imaginableRules of game consistently change--you can be driven to a checkpoint in a freerunning competition?Pretty much the entire script and all dialogue. Six people share credit for the screenplay!So Bad, It's Good:They sell the car, but da Costa is driving it several minutes later.With 20 minutes left to the race, they want to put henchmen on Faris. Next scene (with no time elapsed), he automatically has people chasing him.Danny Dyer as the primary villain, always a delightPretty much the entire script and all dialogue. I repeat, six people!I have no doubt some people will think ""Freerunner"" is the worst movie of the year, and with good cause. But is there brilliance to the badness? I'm still not sure. If you think the movie sounds terrible, stay far away--nothing in the actual film will change your mind. If you don't particularly care about logic or acting or screenwriting, but just like action--this may meet your needs. And if you love bad movie mayhem, this may also be worth your investment.

I know this is a very low budget movie, but, Youtube videos have better graphics then this movie. The effects are terrible. All the explosive are very low quality.The free running status were good. The about the only thing I think they did well in the movie. I didn't care for the kickboxing or fight scenes because they seemed very stupid.The acting in this movie is very bad. Only the main guy, Ryan was a good actor. All the others are terrible actors. When they talk, they don't make me believe in them at all. It seemed very scripted and didn't bring me into the movie, but take me out of it really. The web villains seemed very childish at times.The direction of the movie was bad because as the movie went along, everything seemed to perfect to happened to the main character, Ryan. Spoiler alert...when the group of free runners where being driving away from the green zone from the cops. The free runners will then have to get back to the green zone in 5 mins or they will blow up from the explosive collars. But, they have no way of getting back to the green zone just by running there, even if they got away from the cops. ""Luckily"", Ryan's GF was there with her car to drive them all back to the green zone. Exactly right there, at the right place, at the right time. No way!Another moment that was too perfect was when, another freerunner, Turk, was there just to save Ryan at the end the movie. It didn't really make sense for Turk to be at Ryan's place and to know to go there at that exact time too. What??? Okay, well. ""Luckily"", Turk was there or the movie would had just ended with a bad ending, which maybe it should had. There were other things like that happened throughout the movie, and it just too convenient for it all fall into place like that.Probably the worse thing the movie did was kill off Ryan's rival, Flinch, for no good reason. Flinch won the race, but it didn't make any sense that he just went crazy at the end to lose his mind and not to kill Ryan but to talk back to the head villain, Mr. Frank, of the movie. He then get's blown up for doing that. What??? Now, there's nothing stopping Ryan from just going after the Mr. Frank.The movie needed to stop being too easy for the main star of the movie. It needed better acting and effects. The kickboxing was okay, but wasn't really needed. They could had thought about doing something else then that.

Much like ""Death Race"", the movie is fun and exciting racing scenes with filler in between. A plot almost identical to ""Fighting"" hurt the movie a little, but another very surprising movie to me. I really enjoyed this. Overall, a very entertaining and fast paced movie that is fun to watch. I liked it. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - I think I would.*Also try - Fast Five & Fighting",4,"A surprisingly fun and entertaining movie that is a lot like ""Fighting"" but with running. Worth watching. I surprisingly say B+",1317772800,"10 5, 2011",2011,1111,"['had', 'idea', 'put', 'online', 'make', 'kids', 'run', 'other', 'boom', 'baby', 'wild', 'fire', 'wanting', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'girlfriend', 'grandfather', 'city', 'Ryan', 'freerunner', 'game', 'something', 'illegal', 'bet', 'money', 'when', 'can', 'leave', 'Halfway', 'race', 'something', 'wrong', 'more', 'then', 'money', 'stake', 'have', 'found', 'watching', 'movie', 'seeing', 'preview', 'first', 'helped', 'enjoyment', 'lesser', 'known', 'movies', 'one', 'perfect', 'example', 'Judging', 'cover', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'pretty', 'lame', 'acting', 'was', 'little', 'weak', 'plat', 'un-original', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Much', 'Death', 'Race', 'movie', 'fun', 'exciting', 'racing', 'scenes', 'filler', 'plot', 'almost', 'identical', 'Fighting', 'hurt', 'movie', 'little', 'very', 'surprising', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Overall', 'very', 'entertaining', 'fast', 'paced', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'liked', 'give', 'B+.Would', 'watch', 'again', 'think', 'would', '*Also', 'try', 'Fast', 'Five', 'Fighting']",N/A
