In addition, the movie wasn't as romantic as I thought it would be. It was labelled as a romantic musical, that was why I watched it, but it wasn't. This movie glorifies teen sex. I am not naive. I know that nowadays a lot of teens have sex, but I don't think this is a good idea because they can be teen mums. There's a character that openly proclaims to 'have a lot of sex' as she puts it. She seems to think that this is a great thing, and nobody opposes her in the group. Instead, they say things like, 'tell us something that we don't already know', as if to say that it's okay. And they sing songs with lyrics like, 'let's talk about sex baby...' and 'I'll make love to you....', among others.

Usually I hate singing in movies, but all of the musical numbers were so stellar.  The cast has chemistry, and I enjoyed Anna Kendrick and Skyler Astin's performances, the latter having an abundance of charisma without being sentimental or smarmy.  I do think it could have been better edited - I loathed the scenes with Becca's father - except for the first scene, they weren't really necessary, and I would have included some of the hilarious deleted scenes I saw on youtube instead.  I wasn't a fan of Rebel Wilson/Fat Amy - her character just didn't work for me, and her singing was mediocre.  I thought both Hana Mae Lee/Lilly Okanakamura, and Alexis Knapp/Stacie Conrad's characters funnier and more quirky.

Said plot is paper thin, and involves a cool girl who is an awesome DJ losing some sort of bet with her strict Dad and being more or less forced to join an acapella club? Even as mindless musicals go this is pretty dumbAll the song numbers are well done and I have no issue with them at all. Obviously most of the actors were chosen for their singing ability and not for their acting abilityAll the non-singing scenes are more or less ridiculous. So if you can tune those out you'll probably enjoy this, if not then not, i guess. Frequently a group of kids will walk for what must be 20 minutes to get to the perfect practice location, then sing literally the first 30 seconds of a pop tune, go ""ok that was great (or terrible)!"" and then they all leave. Just stuff like thatIf you don't mind that then whatever. I checked this movie out mostly because I like mash ups and because I like Elizabeth Banks, and the mash ups delivered while Elizabeth Banks basically serves no purpose at all in this film. Her entire part could have been cut and it wouldn't have mattered, at all.So anyway, those are my thoughts on it, more or less.

It is a beloved chick flick with bite and it centers around little publicized competition (this being `Glee' inspired a cappella groups, the latter being cheerleading).  I know that throwing comparisons can be lazy (and a tad misleading) but this one fits rather well.`Bring it On' was a better film, but that isn't saying that `Pitch Perfect' isn't pretty lovable.The film follows a similar narrative.  In this film we are introduced to Beca, an aspiring DJ who gets suckered into joining an all-girl a cappella group in hopes to dethroning the arrogant boys group at the finals.  Hesitant, she is soon caroled into the spirit of it all but balks at the lame musical choices and the dictatorship happening within the group.  Her musicality makes an impression on a few of the members of the group, but their rigid leader is determined to keep things `her way'.  Throw in a forbidden romance between Beca and Jesse, a member of the rival all-boys group, and you have a little `Romeo + Juliet' with you `Bring it On'.All in all, I really liked this one.  The cast, for the most part, is really fun.  Rebel Wilson is hilarious and completely owns this movie.  The pacing is great, and despite the predictability of it all (you know she'll get the guy, you know her group will come together in the end) it is still so rewarding to watch it unfold.  I also love almost any chick flick that has music or dancing at the core.  It's just entertaining, and my love of `Glee' (at least the first two seasons) trickles heavily into my bias for a film about singing, especially a cappella.  Still, there is this nagging detractor, and that is my distaste for Anna Kendrick.  I just find her so plain and boring.  There is nothing special about this girl and she continues to bore me in everything.  I know she has an Oscar nomination under her belt (so undeserved) but I am just so apathetic towards her performances.  She is at the center of every scene here, but thankfully the spunkiness of the film itself and the fun of the supporting cast outweigh her blandness.Oh, and my decade-long crush on Brittany Snow got amped up a notch when she went red.",4,"Not quite perfect, but it has great pitch!",1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,2219,"['Maybe', 'generations', 'Bring', 'mean', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'beloved', 'chick', 'flick', 'bite', 'around', 'little', 'publicized', 'competition', 'being', 'Glee', 'inspired', 'cappella', 'groups', 'latter', 'being', 'cheerleading', 'know', 'throwing', 'comparisons', 'can', 'be', 'lazy', 'tad', 'misleading', 'one', 'rather', 'well.', 'Bring', 'was', 'better', 'film', ""n't"", 'saying', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'lovable.The', 'film', 'similar', 'narrative', 'film', 'are', 'introduced', 'Beca', 'aspiring', 'DJ', 'who', 'suckered', 'joining', 'all-girl', 'cappella', 'group', 'hopes', 'dethroning', 'arrogant', 'boys', 'group', 'finals', 'Hesitant', 'soon', 'caroled', 'spirit', 'balks', 'lame', 'musical', 'choices', 'dictatorship', 'happening', 'group', 'musicality', 'impression', 'few', 'members', 'group', 'rigid', 'leader', 'determined', 'keep', 'things', 'way', 'Throw', 'forbidden', 'romance', 'Beca', 'Jesse', 'member', 'rival', 'all-boys', 'group', 'have', 'little', 'Romeo', '+', 'Juliet', 'Bring', ""On'.All"", 'really', 'liked', 'one', 'cast', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'fun', 'Rebel', 'Wilson', 'hilarious', 'completely', 'movie', 'pacing', 'great', 'predictability', 'know', ""'ll"", 'get', 'guy', 'know', 'group', 'will', 'come', 'together', 'end', 'still', 'so', 'rewarding', 'watch', 'unfold', 'also', 'love', 'almost', 'chick', 'flick', 'music', 'dancing', 'core', 'just', 'entertaining', 'love', 'Glee', 'least', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'heavily', 'bias', 'film', 'singing', 'especially', 'cappella', 'Still', 'nagging', 'detractor', 'distaste', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'just', 'find', 'so', 'plain', 'boring', 'nothing', 'special', 'girl', 'bore', 'everything', 'know', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'belt', 'so', 'undeserved', 'am', 'just', 'so', 'apathetic', 'towards', 'performances', 'center', 'scene', 'here', 'thankfully', 'spunkiness', 'film', 'fun', 'supporting', 'cast', 'blandness.Oh', 'decade-long', 'crush', 'Brittany', 'Snow', 'got', 'amped', 'up', 'notch', 'when', 'went', 'red']",N/A

At first I wasn't sure I how much I would enjoy this movie but it was absolutely addicting. The soundtrack featured many tunes that you can't help to sing along to, hum or just dance in your seat to. This is one of those movies that will be over before you know it.You'll find yourself rooting for Beca, Fat Amy, Chloe and the rest of the Barden Bellas as they overcome many obstacles, including themselves en route to the a cappella singing championships. The soundtrack to this movie is top-notch. Songs like ""Don't You Forget About Me,' ""Oh Mickey,"" ""Let's Talk About Sex,"" ""Like A Virgin,"" are a few of the older hit songs that are included along the way, and you will also find some new hits, all done a cappella. When you hear the term a cappella, don't be misled, these are no barbershop quartet singers here. They rock their way through the movie with style and flair.I give this movie 5 stars. This movie has it all, comedy, great music and a very believable, loveable cast of characters. And as funny as these singers are, you'll also be laughing out loud at the judges.

1567925,AAX387K7441BL,B008JFUUIA,AvidReader,"[0, 0]","First of all I have to admit that I'm a huge fan of good musicals, and not-so-good musicals (except Mamma Mia which was a step too far, even for me). Pitch Perfect is definitely not perfect. In fact many of the jokes fall flat and some of the humour is questionable, but overall I really enjoyed this movie!When I started watching it my expectations were pretty low. After a s*** day at work I needed a pick-me-up and was ready to forgive a lot of its sins if the music was good. The music is very good, and the audtion sequence with Kelly Clarkson's Since You've Been Gone is gold. Another stand-out scene is the improvised rif- off between the rival acapella groups. In a lot of ways this is Glee / High School Musical type of film, but at the same time it pushes the boundaries in a really clever way that will not alienate fans. It's both a parody and a tribute.What elevated it for me was that some of the humour comes straight out of left-field and is completely unexpected. Most of the characters are weird and over-the-top, but they work, and Rebel Wilson's deadpan delivery of her lines is one of the highlights of the films (although I am getting sick of seeing her play exactly the same role in every movie she's in. Makes me wonder if she has any range beyond the funny fat chick). Anna Kendrick was perfect in the lead role and Skylar Astin is great too. (he's way too young for me to perve on but what a cutie).The only sour note was the depiction of the predatory lesbian character who takes any opportunity to grope women. In this day and age it's disappointing that homosexuality is even an issue. The vomit scenes were pretty disgusting, but the scene were the women are all struggling to get away from Aubrey as she blows chunks is like something straight out of a horror movie. It's very funny, at least for a few seconds, but the ""vomit angel"" took it a bit too far. Both my husband and I agreed that the Treblemaker's performance at the end was actually better than the Bella's, but this is a mnor thing. Do I recommend this film?

1567926,AI46E73DWKD2B,B008JFUUIA,BackToGood,"[0, 0]","PITCH PERFECT (2012) might actually be one of the more original, truly fun comedies that Hollywood has churned out in recent years. No parody, no annoying self-awareness, no (well, very little) cheap or silly humor. Just an honest, earnest, witty comedy with romantic undertones and great music! While the overarching plot might have been done ad nauseaum, Pitch Perfect still feels very original. The main reason is the subject matter: focusing on the world of collegiate acapella competition.Set at fictional fine arts college Barden University, Pitch Perfect stars the extremely talented Anna Kendrick, who nails it in her first starring role, after having played backup in all prior films. Kendrick is rock solid as the musically inclined and gifted, but introverted rebellious loner Beca, an entering freshman at Barden, who has a hard time fitting in and would rather quit college and become a DJ in Los Angeles, but her estranged father, a professor at the university, compels her to finish out her freshman year and joining a club and if she doesn't like it, then he'll fund her start in LA. So Beca tries out for the Bellas, an all-female acapella group at Barden.The Bellas are led by seniors Chloe (confidently played by the radiant Brittany Snow) and Aubrey (deftly played by Anna Camp), who recruit 8 new members (including Beca). Other newbies include Cynthia Rose (sublimely played by wonderful singer-musician Ester Dean) and scene-stealers Fat Amy (played with perfect comic timing by Rebel Wilson), Stacie (winningly played by super-sexy Alexis Knapp), and Lilly (hilariously played by Hana Mae Lee). These actresses combine with star Kendrick and minor characters Jessica (Kelley Jakle), Denise (Wanetah Walmsley), and Ashley (Shelly Regner), to form a winning combo of acting, musical, and dancing talent.Not to be outdone by the wonderful female cast, there are several male cast mates that make this film work, too. The Bellas' main competition at Barden are the defending international champion, the all-male group the Barden Treblemakers. Led by the obnoxious senior Bumper (hilarious work by Adam Devine) and returning most of the group from the previous year, including Bumper's second-in-command senior Donald (talented rapper Utkarsh Ambudkar), the Treblemakers pass on freshman and magician-in-training Benji (played with boyish charm by Ben Platt), but decide to add life-loving freshman Jesse (superbly played by the extremely gifted singer Skylar Astin) to their acapella ranks.Jesse is the film's love interest for Beca. Astin imbues Jesse with a charm, confidence, and bravado that stands out. Jesse and Beca have this cool, old-fashioned, slow-building romance that is simultaneously heartwarming and sensuous, thanks to the acting talents of Kendrick and Astin as the films romantic leads.The actors actually do their own singing, performing all the covers acapella and sound great while doing it, really selling themselves as true performers of this medium. They do ear-pleasing renditions and mash-ups of popular songs, both old and new. There's a great scene early on where the acapella groups square off against each other in a ""riff-off"" competition of popular songs. And the Bellas and Trebles performance routines, especially the ones in the climactic competition, are to die for!But while the film has it's share of music (and wonderfully performed at that), the film's focus is on the comedy element.

I used to not be into them at all and then one slipped into my heart (Across the Universe) and I was finally able to see what a truly well put together music based film could offer. First and foremost, to be bearable to even watch, it needs to feel natural. That means the cast must not only click, but each person must have their own personal style that they can draw upon in the music. That means NOT having someone in the background feed them what the music should sound and feel like to them. If the cast can do that, then the film will have great potential.This ensemble nails that ""click"" in every way. Everyone of them can sing and bring their own flare ...and it doesn't feel like they were randomly cast based on popularity or sex appeal only to be dubbed over with an actual singer whose voice doesn't fit them (okay...off that rant...).Furthermore, Pitch Perfect has the perfect balance of comedy that is played in the right parts by the right people, and again doesn't feel forced or overdone. Sometimes with these types of shows you can start with good intentions but then Hollywood gets involved and you end up with a train wreck that is grasping at straws for comedic value (the movie Rock of Ages, anyone??).Overall, great flick to stay in with a group of friends and find a character that best fits your friends and laugh over the crazyness.

Sure, there's the television show ""Glee"" that explores the same thing, but the television show ""Glee"" is studio doctored a-cappella. The beauty of the human voice without instruments or synthesizers is truly a lost art form and ""Pitch Perfect"" represents well.The best part about ""Pitch Perfect"" and the a-cappella that it demonstrates is the realization that Anna Kendrick (Up in the Air, 50/50) can really sing among other things. One scene in particular stands out where she auditions for the a-cappella group, `the Bellas'. In the scene, she creates music with her hand and a cup while singing. Brittany Snow as well showed off her singing ability in the television show ""American Dream"" but here, she hits it out of the park even more. Then there is Rebel Wilson, who plays Fat Amy. You may remember her from the smash hit ""Bridesmaids"" from last year. She adds the humor and spice to the group.""Pitch Perfect"" isn't without criticism in its predictability. Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton recently teamed up for a more wholesome film called ""Joyful Noise"" in which a group of choir singers are trying to compete in a national competition and need to spice up their routine. You get the same storyline with ""Pitch Perfect"". Given though, ""Pitch Perfect"" is by far the superior film of the two. The comedy is better and the a-cappella is real and well constructed.The a-cappella in ""Pitch Perfect"" is the film. Director Jason Moore who knows a thing or two about music, having directed ""Avenue Q"" on broadway, knew it had to be great. The storyline wasn't going to be the selling point. He also knows a thing or two about what young teen audiences want as well, with a few directing credits on the WB and CW networks. There are many highlights throughout the film and I even found some of the musical numbers in the middle of the film more compelling than the finale.""Pitch Perfect"" is a combination of a lot of films, but the good thing is, all those films are good ones. Movies like ""Mean Girls"", ""Bridesmaids"", ""Joyful Noise"", ""Bring it On"" and oh, I'd have to mention ""Glee"" even though Glee is sort of fake a-cappella, are all inspirations for what turned out to be a movie with a routine storyline that you can't take your eyes off of.

With that out of the way, I found that ""Pitch Perfect"" had a very unique and interesting story idea but that it wasn't as well executed as it could have been. I applaud the writer(s) and director for trying something different with the coming-of-age romantic comedy genre. The plot concerns a group of girls that are trying to win the nationwide college A cappella competition from their rivals, an all male group that has won the previous years. The singing sections are interesting and give the film its own unique style. However, I found that the intermediary stages were not that great. Most of the characters in the movie are either one-dimensional or forgettable. The leader of the girls group, for example, is so singularly overbearing that the scenes where she fights with the group become quickly repetitive and boring. I did not find the Australian fat girl that funny. I laughed at the introduction of the roommates to the lead characters but then they are never developed effectively. The key to this kind of film is quirky characters that will deliver good punch lines or be the brunt of a joke (see Rushmore, for example). Without developed characters, the non-musical scenes just seemed like filler. I also think the material was more appropriate for a high school setting.

And their major rival is an all boys group on the same campus.  How gauche!  The girls group is in a rut; their act has grown boring and stale, yet headstrong leader Aubrey (Anna Camp) refuses to take on new material, forcing a girl power revolt, led by talented Beca (Anna Kendrick), and The Barden Bellas get their act together just in time for their climactic performance that brings down the house.  Meanwhile, there's an on-again, off-again romance between Beca and Jesse (Skylar Astin), a member of the rival boy band, that's so predictable you can set your watch to it.Outside of Kendrick (along with John Michael Higgins and the stunning Elizabeth Banks, who play the announcers at the various a cappella contests), the cast of PITCH PERFECT is unknown to me, yet for the most part turns in enough energy to keep this light offering fresh.  And no complaints whatsoever with all the gorgeous Barden Bellas eye candy; scrumptious.  As an extra bonus, the cast can flat out sing, and many of the cover songs you'll recognize and enjoy as the various groups strut their stuff.  (There's even a song performed from the movieThe Breakfast Club, for goodness sake.)  Some of the humor is sophomoric and lame, some of it works, but overall if you're looking for fluff to entertain you for 90 minutes, you can't go wrong with PITCH PERFECT.--D.

When there's nothing else on and I want some background noise that I can laugh at when I hear a certain line or catch a certain scene, its usually this movie. Its funny as hell! Some complain, saying the story is predictable. ""Will they win in the end or will they end up together?"" Hell, you can probably answer those questions correctly without having seen this movie. But what some call predictability, I call familiarity. Its a paint by numbers plot for sure, but I think knowing where the story's going gives you more room to let loose and laugh easy. But that's not to say that this movie isn't devoid of surprises. Oh no! Going by the trailer, you can't imagine how charming and funny this movie will be.

It's not perfectly written from a screenwriter's point of view, but it's pretty close.  There are also a few lines that more or less get thrown away because of the speed and volume at which they are said--I am the type who will rewind and even put on the subtitles for one sentence to see what I missed--but it's not a big deal.  While the cast is good, Rebel Wilson steals the show in almost every scene she is in.  Sometimes she's a little awkward, but it just adds to her character.

In this case it is an acapella competition. There are two main acapella groups at Borden University, the Treblemakers (all male) and the Borden Bellas (all female). The tremblemakers are the reigning champs due to an unfortunate incident at last year's finals. The Bellas are ready to start fresh and claim the victory.The story follows a freshman with a knack for music. She is great at creating beats and has an impressive voice. She eventually joins up with the Bellas. After repeatedly being upstaged by the Treblemakers, the Bellas come out victorious in the end when new material is added to their routine.My wife was the one who really wanted to see this. Many of her friends mentioned how great and funny it was. There were a few good lines here and there, but mostly the comedy was lacking. Her final opinion was that it was decent. This coming from someone who absolutely loves glee, I was shocked.I had a completely different approach to it. I had no prior knowledge of the movie. This probably worked in my favor as I had no previous misconception of what to expect. The acting is decent, the funny jokes few and far between. The real reason to watch the movie...the performances! As a youth I can remember watching ""Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?"" My favorite part was when Rockapella (the name of the group) would sing the theme song. When I heard the performances, my eyes lit up and my love for acapella was renewed. After watching the entire movie once, I used scene selection and played only the performance/concert portions. Yeah, they are that good! The rest of the movie, I can live without.There were a few parts about the movie I thought took away from it slightly.In the beginning, Freshmen are looking at the various groups they can join. The male lead nonchalantly goes over to the Treblemakers and decides to sign up on a whim. This seems like behavior more suited to someone not sure if they'd be accepted into the group, not the person who eventually becomes their top soloist.The other questionable call was during the audition selection when the bellas decide to pick a girl who you can barely hear (it was something that was supposed to be funny, I'm sure). She whispers her way through Kelly Clarkson's Since You're Been Gone. And they picked her! Seriously?

1568234,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B008JFUUIA,Kenya Starflight,"[2, 4]","When I saw this movie on store shelves, I assumed it was yet another ""High School Musical"" knockoff -- and since that movie didn't exactly impress me, I avoided this one.  Only when a family member raved about the movie and told me it highlighted that oft-overlooked subgenre of music known as acapella, I decided to give it a shot.  I love acapella music, and was curious to see how this movie would portray it... as well as to hear the songs, especially those by an all-girl acapella group (a rarity in the genre).I came away from this movie rather disappointed.  Yes, the songs are fun and catchy, but the rest of the movie is a clich&eacute;d, over-the-top mess.  And it seems like the movie doesn't know whether to take itself seriously or play up the camp, and so settles for a whiplash-inducing mix of both.At first the movie starts to follow an all-female acapella group known as the Bellas, as they botch the finals of an intense competition by virtue of the soloist throwing up rather graphically onstage.  Then the movie instead switches to Becca, a reluctant college student who wants to be a DJ but is being pushed into school by her estranged father, who's paying her way through college.  When one of the Bellas overhears her singing in the shower, she convinces her to audition for the Bellas, and Becca makes the cut... only to find herself constantly at odds with Audrey, the Bellas' controlling leader who insists that they sing the same songs at every show despite said songs boring their audience to tears.  Becca unexpectedly warms up to the eclectic mix of girls among the Bellas, including a shy girl prone to whispering creepy phrases, a possible lesbian, and a girl who proudly dubs herself ""Fat Amy"" for obvious reasons.  But when Becca falls for a member of the Bellas' competition the Treblemakers, butts heads with Audrey one too many times, and has her dreams of DJ-hood dashed by her father, she finds herself cut off from her newfound friends... but is determined to help them make it to the finals anyhow.By far the best part of this movie is the songs.  While they're all covers, all the bands cover the songs well... and totally without instruments, relying on the human voice to provide vocals, accompaniment, and even drums.  Even if you're not a fan of acapella music, you'll enjoy these songs, which range from '80s to hits of the modern day.The storyline, if you couldn't tell from the above synopsis, is a mess.  The movie can't seem to decide if it's about the struggles of girl trying to follow her dreams despite pressure from others, or about a group of mismatched misfits trying to succeed.  It tries to be about both, and sadly both storylines suffer from the film trying to juggle both.  I would have much preferred it if the film had picked one or the other and focused on it.  And on a writing-related note, the humor seems to focus on either puns on the word ""acapella"" (""aca-awkward,"" ""aca-serious,"" ""aca-amazing,"") etc., or on vomit jokes.  The former is far more eyeroll-inducing than funny, especially since the puns are delivered in perfect seriousness and without any hint of humor or irony... and the latter is just disgusting instead of funny.The characters are what really kill the movie for me.  They're all either incredibly bland (such as Becca's love interest) or, far more often, annoying to the point where they grate on the nerves.  Becca and her Korean roommate are unlikable, Fat Amy is far too over-the-top to be believable, the announcers of the competition have mean and nasty senses of humor, and Audrey and the male leader of the Treblemakers are both obnoxious and hateful characters.  In the case of the latter two I suppose one could make the argument that they're antagonists and are supposed to be obnoxious, but they have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and that bothers me.  Even the love interest's nerdy roommate is bland, serving no point to the plot and having no personality outside his love of magic tricks and obsession with Star Wars and the Treblemakers.  The one character I liked was the shy, creepy girl, who has some of the best lines in the movie (though you have to turn on subtitles to understand what she's saying).I suggest passing on this movie and going for the soundtrack instead.  It's too adult-oriented for the ""High School Musical"" crowd, but is too clich&eacute;d and mean-spirited for most others to enjoy.",2,"Go for the soundtrack instead -- cliched, mean-spirited, and a mess of a plot",1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,4418,"['When', 'saw', 'movie', 'store', 'shelves', 'assumed', 'was', 'yet', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'knockoff', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'impress', 'avoided', 'one', 'Only', 'when', 'family', 'member', 'raved', 'movie', 'told', 'highlighted', 'oft-overlooked', 'subgenre', 'music', 'known', 'acapella', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'love', 'acapella', 'music', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'would', 'portray', 'as', 'well', 'hear', 'songs', 'especially', 'all-girl', 'acapella', 'group', 'rarity', 'genre', '.I', 'came', 'away', 'movie', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'Yes', 'songs', 'are', 'fun', 'catchy', 'rest', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'over-the-top', 'mess', 'movie', ""n't"", 'know', 'take', 'seriously', 'play', 'up', 'camp', 'so', 'settles', 'whiplash-inducing', 'mix', 'both.At', 'first', 'movie', 'follow', 'all-female', 'acapella', 'group', 'known', 'Bellas', 'botch', 'finals', 'intense', 'competition', 'virtue', 'soloist', 'throwing', 'up', 'rather', 'graphically', 'onstage', 'Then', 'movie', 'instead', 'Becca', 'reluctant', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'be', 'DJ', 'being', 'pushed', 'school', 'estranged', 'father', 'who', 'paying', 'way', 'college', 'When', 'one', 'Bellas', 'singing', 'shower', 'audition', 'Bellas', 'Becca', 'cut', 'only', 'find', 'constantly', 'odds', 'Audrey', 'Bellas', 'controlling', 'leader', 'who', 'sing', 'same', 'songs', 'show', 'said', 'songs', 'boring', 'audience', 'tears', 'Becca', 'unexpectedly', 'up', 'eclectic', 'mix', 'girls', 'Bellas', 'including', 'shy', 'girl', 'prone', 'whispering', 'creepy', 'phrases', 'possible', 'lesbian', 'girl', 'who', 'proudly', 'Fat', 'Amy', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'when', 'Becca', 'member', 'Bellas', 'competition', 'Treblemakers', 'butts', 'heads', 'Audrey', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'dreams', 'DJ-hood', 'dashed', 'father', 'cut', 'off', 'newfound', 'friends', 'determined', 'help', 'make', 'finals', 'anyhow.By', 'far', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'songs', ""'re"", 'covers', 'bands', 'cover', 'songs', 'well', 'totally', 'instruments', 'relying', 'human', 'voice', 'provide', 'vocals', 'accompaniment', 'even', 'drums', 'Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'fan', 'acapella', 'music', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'songs', 'range', ""'80s"", 'hits', 'modern', 'day.The', 'storyline', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'above', 'synopsis', 'mess', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'decide', 'struggles', 'girl', 'trying', 'follow', 'dreams', 'pressure', 'others', 'group', 'mismatched', 'misfits', 'trying', 'succeed', 'be', 'sadly', 'storylines', 'suffer', 'film', 'trying', 'juggle', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'preferred', 'film', 'had', 'picked', 'one', 'other', 'focused', 'writing-related', 'note', 'humor', 'focus', 'puns', 'word', 'acapella', 'aca-awkward', 'aca-serious', 'aca-amazing', 'etc.', 'vomit', 'jokes', 'former', 'far', 'more', 'eyeroll-inducing', 'funny', 'especially', 'puns', 'are', 'delivered', 'perfect', 'seriousness', 'hint', 'humor', 'irony', 'latter', 'just', 'disgusting', 'instead', 'funny.The', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'really', 'kill', 'movie', ""'re"", 'incredibly', 'bland', 'such', 'Becca', 'love', 'interest', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'annoying', 'point', 'where', 'grate', 'nerves', 'Becca', 'Korean', 'roommate', 'are', 'unlikable', 'Fat', 'Amy', 'far', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'be', 'believable', 'announcers', 'competition', 'have', 'mean', 'nasty', 'senses', 'humor', 'Audrey', 'male', 'leader', 'Treblemakers', 'are', 'obnoxious', 'hateful', 'characters', 'case', 'latter', 'two', 'suppose', 'one', 'could', 'make', 'argument', ""'re"", 'antagonists', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'obnoxious', 'have', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'whatsoever', 'bothers', 'Even', 'love', 'interest', 'nerdy', 'roommate', 'bland', 'serving', 'point', 'plot', 'having', 'personality', 'love', 'magic', 'tricks', 'obsession', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Treblemakers', 'one', 'character', 'liked', 'was', 'shy', 'creepy', 'girl', 'who', 'best', 'lines', 'movie', 'have', 'turn', 'subtitles', 'understand', 'what', 'saying', '.I', 'suggest', 'passing', 'movie', 'going', 'soundtrack', 'instead', 'too', 'adult-oriented', 'High', 'School', 'Musical', 'crowd', 'too', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'mean-spirited', 'most', 'others', 'enjoy']",N/A

1568256,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B008JFUUIA,K.T. May,"[2, 34]","The lovely Anna Kendrick (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) stars in Pitch Perfect, a film produced by actress Elizabeth Banks (People Like Us) that could be the product of a hook-up between television's ""Glee"" and the Scary Movie franchise. It starts off with an unexpected gag (quite literally) and stumbles along for nearly two hours, trying to figure out what kind of movie it wants to be. It has romance, a few heartwarming moments (mostly at the end), some scenes that try to be comedy but aren't funny, and some halfway decent tunes. It won't have you running home to purchase the soundtrack, though, although the ""Cups"" scene is certainly worthy of mention. It certainly does not compare to ""Glee"" and seems to be an obvious attempt to cash in on a cash cow.So the plot goes like this. Snobby Aubrey (Anna Camp) and likeable Chloe (Brittany Snow) need to recruit girls for their school's acapella girl group, the Barden Bellas, in order to beat rival boy group the Treblemakers at next year's competition. It seems that the unlikely scenario has occurred in which their entire group, aside from Aubrey and Chloe, have graduated. Beca (Kendrick) is new to the school, and she desires a career in making music. She doesn't want to be a singer - she literally wants to make music. She regularly combines samples on her laptop to create mash-ups that aren't anything special. She is told she is ""very good"", but her songs beg to differ.Beca shares a room with stereotypical Asian roommate Kimmy Jin (Jinhee Joung) who, no joke, is tinkering with a gold Bonsai tree when Beca arrives. Beca is the typical disgruntled child of a typical broken home with a throwaway dad who she typically blames for the divorce. Yawn. On her first day, Beca has a run-in with Jesse (Skylar Astin), who is the obvious love interest. Despite appearing like a jerk while attempting to be endearing, Jesse becomes more likeable throughout the film. Luke (Freddie Stroma) is Jesse and Beca's boss at the college radio station where they end up landing jobs without being interviewed, and we don't see nearly enough of this genetically superior specimen. What follows amongst the three of them is a love triangle so subtle that it would be undetected and forgettable if Jesse didn't keep reminding us of it with his jealousy over Beca's assumed fawning.Benji (Ben Platt), Jesse's weird roommate (as we're reminded multiple times), is the kid you try to avoid in the high school halls while not realizing that he is just ""sweet and misunderstood."" You hope he doesn't kill himself halfway through the film. He is obsessed with magic and idolizes the Treblemakers to a creepy level, but it's okay, because he's really just an innocent. He attempts to join the group, only to be bullied by the lead douchebag, Bumper (Adam DeVine). Seriously, that's his name - Bumper.Moving on, despite the new fad of films that showcase Ellen Page-type characters as female leads (i.e. likeable, no-nonsense, strong women), Beca sells out (as seen in the trailer), and decides to join the quirky Bellas after Chloe accosts her in the shower when she hears Beca's singing voice. But Beca sings along with the music she creates, so it is assumed that this can be enough to justify the oddity of her willingness to submit to a concept that she declined merely hours ago.The Bellas recruit the quirkiest auditioners (""Glee"", anyone?), the most notable being Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). Wilson earned the target spot in Entertainment Weekly's ""Bulls-Eye"" column last week, and it is easy to see why, as she is the Gimli of the group (i.e. chubby comic relief). She consistently pokes fun at her own weight before the ""twig"" girls can do it first, and despite being given a solo at one point, she does not have the vocals necessary to impress. Beca is obviously the She's All That type of girl who possesses all the talent and charm that we would all be privy to if she would just remove her nonexistent glasses and let her hair down, as Jesse is quick to point out. Thank you, Mr. Exposition.Arguably, the most enjoyable vocals in the group next to Beca is Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean), although they barely give her any lines and reduce her to yet another boring stereotype cliche. Of course she's the lesbian - she's the one with the crazy hair who wears flannel shirts. Yawn. Hana Mae Lee is snicker-worthy as Lilly, the token Asian of the group who speaks so quietly that you have to strain to hear her, although all she spews is Ralph Wiggum-type nonsense anyway.This is one of those films that shows you all of its best moments in the trailer, such as the ""Riff-Off"" in which both the Bellas and the Treblemakers meet in what appears to be a drained pool in a Jets/Sharks attempt to out-sing each other. For what purpose? It is never made clear, but it seems that the ""Riff-Off"" will determine who will win the competition. Not only is this completely inaccurate, but wouldn't you just watch each other's performances at previous competitions? It makes no sense, but it is fun, especially when Beca jumps in with her rendition of Blackstreet's ""No Diggity"".There is a moment in the film when Jesse is explaining to Beca, who is bored by all movies, that she needs to watch more of them because the endings are the best part, especially when they're unpredictable. This scene masquerades as a relieving foreshadowing, promising that this film will have the surprising and unpredictable ending that Jesse longs for in the films that he wants to someday score. The ending to Pitch Perfect is decent enough, but it certainly won't stick with you long after the film ends. It is not the Rudy of musical comedies.Banks and John Michael Higgins have cameos in the film a l&agrave; Jason Bateman and Gary Coleman's scenes in Dodgeball. They are announcers for these competitions, and they get ridiculously glam for the occasions, despite no one ever seeing them way up there in their booth. They say silly things that are meant to incite laughter but that are unfunny and insulting, like how women can't win a competition in much the same way that they shouldn't be doctors.In an attempt to explain that Aubrey is resistent to change, the script calls for The Bellas to perform the same tired version of ""I Saw the Sign"" multiple times until the audience in the film, along with the audience in the theater, falls asleep. These scenes could have actually been funny, if done right. The Bellas could have performed songs that no one had ever heard of, or that haven't been popular since the sixties or seventies. Hearing the same jaded '90s song over and over again felt like each audience member was Alex in A Clockwork Orange, forced to stare at the screen in agony to the point of retching. Speaking of retching...nah, that's a gross surprise you can find out on your own.Despite the moments of silliness in this film, though, the ending was enjoyable and will give you the warm and fuzzies. Despite being lauded as a ""musical"", this film does not require great acoustics or a theater viewing to get the necessary experience. This film can definitely be passed off as a rental if you'd rather save your cash. It was surprising to see Banks' name attached to a film of lackluster quality, and sad for Kendrick, who is usually equally enjoyable. Pitch Perfect wasn't horrible, but it you shouldn't hate yourself if you decide to skip it.",2,"If ""Glee"" and ""Scary Movie"" had a baby...",1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,7379,"['lovely', 'Anna',

So already points for being something new, even if the story is as predictable as you can kind of guess it is. But I've seen Die Hard tons of times. It's about the journey not the destination.And Pitch Perfect's journey is great. You all know the story, Beca (Anna Kendrick) joins a fledgling college Accapella group and they go to finals. But it's charming, sweet, witty, and the music is actually pretty good. Special mention again to Anna Kendrick who is a FANTASTIC singer, I was very blown away.

If you want an autobiographical account of the music/glee/a capella industry, then watch something else. This movie makes no apologies in it's attempt to entertain/parody. There are moments of stupidity and cheesiness but it's all in fun. Before you even contemplate seeing this movie you should realize that yes there are stereotypes, and references to sex, drugs, and alcohol. There are 2 scenes which are frankly very disgusting but if you can stomach all of these things and focus on the actual movie and characters then you will love this movie. Those that have issues with the characters or story should realize that this movie is based on a novel written by Mickey Rapkin called ""Pitch Perfect"". He was a journalist whom in fact followed and covered the trials and tribulations of 3 a capella collegiate groups over the course of one year. The characters and events are based on his findings and experiences. If you have a problem with that then watch something else. Personally I consider this movie one of the greatest comedies I've ever seen. Rebel Wilson is extraordinarily funny in this movie. This movie is easily the funniest and best feel good movie of the year. I would even go so far as to say that I would rate as one of the 10 best comedies I have ever seen. First and foremost, if you go into this movie with an open mind, and not expect Shakespearean dialogue, acting. or directing then you will enjoy this movie as well.

She wants to be a music producer, and spends her free time doing mashups on her DJ equipment. She is pissed and just wants to get through school so she can live her dream.She eventually is coerced into trying out for the prestigious a capella all girl group the Barden Bellas. Who are suffering as well. They lost the singing competition to their arch rival the all-boys group, the Trebles when their leader Aubrey (one of my favorite True Blood Characters from season 2) played by Anna Camp suddenly chucked all over the audience. Now the group is hurting for participants and have a seemingly nonredeemable stigma placed upon them.The new blood in the Barden Bellas are an eclectic bunch including Fat Amy played by Rebel Wilson who is hysterical. I loved when she was on screen.What's a girl movie without a love interest. Skyar Astin plays Jesse who is very interested in Beca. He is charming, adorable and can sing. What more can a girl ask for?This is a comedy on so many levels with funny lines, moments and the hysterical duo of Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins who stole each scene they are in.I LOVED it. Seriously, I wasn't as interested when it was in the theaters. A lot of my friends wanted to see it but it seem young and boring to me. A bunch of girls singing in a competition. Whatev! It was so much more than that. This for me was a breakout film with so many favorite moments it is hard to sum it all up. It was funny, entertaining, and made me smile. There were some serious performances here by some of Hollywood's young actresses.  Anna Kendrick was awesome. I had never seen Anna before Twilight and had no idea she had such chops. She has lead actress written all over her and I love watching her. There is so much to say but I will just leave you with this...see it. The movie is actually funny and the soundtrack great!

During the non-musical segments you should probably pop some popcorn, read the newspaper, take out the garbage, or any other mundane task you can find because I guarantee that whatever else you choose to do will be less punishing than having to listen to the lines written for this movie.  A huge improvement would have been to cut out the dialogue between the commentators that occurred before, during, and after the performance sequences.  Their dialogues were not at all funny, and I'm not saying that because they were definitely R-rated comments, but because they were so poorly written.My suggestion:  Rent the movie and fast-forward through all the talking, and then totally enjoy the singing.

The cast has the usual suspects.  That is, the cute brainy one, the cute dumb one, the overweight funny one, the sexy one, the black gansta' one, the mean one.  You get the picture.  Not only that, the story is the age old one of competition, this time between a cappella singing groups.Anna Kendrick heads the cast as the girl who just wants to go to L. A. and produce records.  Her dad (John Benjamin Hickey) is a professor at the small college and insists she get an education first.  Anna Camp is Aubrey, the domineering leader of the all-girl warblers who continues to do the same performance of the same songs, dressed in the same 1980's flight-attendant outfits that they always have.The film heads down the expected path including romantic give-and-take between Beca (Kendrick) and a competing singer (Skylar Astin) who is also a co-worker and wannabe writer of film scores.  What elevates the movie above the norm is a funny performance by Rebel Wilson as self-named Fat Amy.  She steals most of her scenes.  There is also the banter between TV announcers played by Elizabeth Banks (her college group was known as the Menstrual Cycles) and John Michael Higgins, an unapologetic misogynist.

The Barden Bellas are Barden's first-ever, all-girl a cappella singing group that rely on their looks and antiquated pop songs to get by in competition. After a disasterous incident at the previous year's finals, the Bellas are back and looking to redeem themselves. Enter Beca (Anna Kendrick). Beca's is a girl who's ambitions lie more with DJ'ing than in her studies and lucky for the Bellas, Beca can sing. And if she wants to get ahead in school, she'll have to do it a cappella style. Soon she's breathing new life, a different look and a fresh sound in to the struggling girl group. Add a pinch of friendly rivalry with Barden's all-male a cappella group, The TrebleMakers, a dash of flirtation and a bit of raunchy humour and you're ready to be pitch slapped outta this world!Okay, I wasn't exactly chomping at the bit to see Pitch Perfect mostly based on the fact that I can't stand the show, Glee, but I got bored one night with my Netflix queue and decided to give it a whirl. Let me just tell you something right now ---- I am soooooo happy I did because this movie was AMAZING! Seriously. I don't know what it is about these types of movies but they put me on this weird musical high. Yeah. It's freaking crazy!But you know what's even crazier? Just how much I liked the movie despite all the wrongness with it. I mean, there was a lot that didn't really work for me but the fact that the good parts were SO good, it pretty much outweighed all of the bad. Ah, the power of musicals. They can do virtually no wrong in my eyes. And I know I'm kinda categorising Pitch Perfect as a musical, but it isn't so in the traditional sense of the term. The majority of the movie isn't spelled out solely via the song and dance numbers, but the heart of the film does lie in its songs. If you remove everything but the musical numbers, you'd still get the overall essense of the movie sans the raunch and quick-wit. So basically, the whole story is told through the music and I'm very much okay with that.I guess my biggest issue with the film was that the plot was sometimes a little too contrived and some of the chemistry felt forced. For instance, there was an unnecessary love triangle which I totally wasn't buying. In fact, I was even sure it was supposed to be a love triangle. They could've just removed that character and/or bit altogether. Also, much of the raunchier humour (not that there was a lot of it) could've been completely omitted because it just wasn't needed. The movie was funny enough on its own. It was like they were trying to be Bridesmaids only they didn't quite get there.Be that as it may, I will say that the humour of the film was much more elevated than that of most teen comedies today. The comedy lies in the sharp-tongued characters, the witty dialogue and the fact that it wasn't afraid to poke a bit of fun at a cappella while still managing to make it seem super cool. Pitch Perfect verges on the border of satirical without going all the way there, making it more appealing to the masses. Round it out with amazing ad-libbing from Rebel Wilson (love this girl!), Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp and Elizabeth Banks and there's your girl power. Okay, so the guys weren't too bad either.I'd have to say, though, Pitch Pefect's saving grace was in its performances. What I found most impressive was that these actors weren't trained, professional dancers however each of them could really sing. Anna Kendrick knocked it out of the ballpark here. When the groups performed, sparks flew and the musical mash-ups made the movie so memorable. I immediately downloaded the soundtrack after I watched it which has been on replay all week long, I might add! There really isn't much more I can say other than watch it because I think, like me, you'll be pleasantly surprised!Food for Thought: Pitch Perfect is a modern musical that takes a cappella music to the next level, giving it a fresh, modern and pitch perfect feel! I could give or take the plot because the musical numbers are what made it so memorable. This movie was one of the biggest surprises for me so far this year and if you like fun, funky, funny films, I think you'll like this one too.",4,Pitch Perfect takes a capella music and makes it cool again!,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,4305,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'mash', 'together', 'Bring', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'get', 'something', 'oh-so', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'Barden', 'Bellas', 'are', 'Barden', 'first-ever', 'all-girl', 'cappella', 'singing', 'group', 'rely', 'looks', 'antiquated', 'pop', 'songs', 'get', 'competition', 'disasterous', 'incident', 'previous', 'year', 'finals', 'Bellas', 'are', 'back', 'looking', 'redeem', 'Enter', 'Beca', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'Beca', 'girl', 'who', 'ambitions', 'more', ""DJ'ing"", 'studies', 'lucky', 'Bellas', 'Beca', 'can', 'sing', 'get', 'ahead', 'school', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'cappella', 'style', 'Soon', 'breathing', 'new', 'life', 'different', 'look', 'fresh', 'sound', 'struggling', 'girl', 'group', 'Add', 'pinch', 'friendly', 'rivalry', 'Barden', 'all-male', 'cappella', 'group', 'TrebleMakers', 'dash', 'flirtation', 'bit', 'raunchy', 'humour', ""'re"", 'ready', 'be', 'pitch', 'slapped', 'world', 'Okay', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'chomping', 'bit', 'see', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'mostly', 'based', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'show', 'Glee', 'got', 'bored', 'one', 'night', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'decided', 'give', 'whirl', 'Let', 'just', 'tell', 'something', 'right', 'now', 'am', 'soooooo', 'happy', 'did', 'because', 'movie', 'was', 'AMAZING', 'Seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'types', 'movies', 'put', 'weird', 'musical', 'high', 'Yeah', 'freaking', 'crazy', 'know', 'what', 'even', 'crazier', 'Just', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'movie', 'wrongness', 'mean', 'was', 'lot', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'fact', 'good', 'parts', 'were', 'SO', 'good', 'pretty', 'much', 'bad', 'Ah', 'power', 'musicals', 'can', 'do', 'virtually', 'wrong', 'eyes', 'know', ""'m"", 'kinda', 'categorising', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'musical', ""n't"", 'so', 'traditional', 'sense', 'term', 'majority', 'movie', ""n't"", 'spelled', 'out', 'solely', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'heart', 'film', 'lie', 'songs', 'remove', 'everything', 'musical', 'numbers', ""'d"", 'still', 'get', 'overall', 'essense', 'movie', 'raunch', 'quick-wit', 'So', 'basically', 'whole', 'story', 'told', 'music', ""'m"", 'very', 'much', 'okay', 'that.I', 'guess', 'biggest', 'issue', 'film', 'was', 'plot', 'was', 'sometimes', 'little', 'too', 'contrived', 'chemistry', 'felt', 'forced', 'instance', 'was', 'unnecessary', 'love', 'triangle', 'totally', 'was', ""n't"", 'buying', 'fact', 'was', 'even', 'sure', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'love', 'triangle', 'could', ""'ve"", 'just', 'removed', 'character', 'and/or', 'bit', 'altogether', 'Also', 'much', 'raunchier', 'humour', 'not', 'was', 'lot', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'completely', 'omitted', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'enough', 'own', 'was', 'were', 'trying', 'be', 'Bridesmaids', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'there.Be', 'may', 'will', 'say', 'humour', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'elevated', 'most', 'teen', 'comedies', 'today', 'comedy', 'sharp-tongued', 'characters', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'poke', 'bit', 'fun', 'cappella', 'still', 'managing', 'make', 'seem', 'super', 'cool', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'verges', 'border', 'satirical', 'going', 'way', 'there', 'making', 'more', 'appealing', 'masses', 'Round', 'out', 'amazing', 'ad-libbing', 'Rebel', 'Wilson', 'love', 'girl', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'Brittany', 'Snow', 'Anna', 'Camp', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'girl', 'power', 'Okay', 'guys', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'either.I', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'though', 'Pitch', 'Pefect', 'saving', 'grace', 'was', 'performances', 'What', 'found', 'most', 'impressive', 'was', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'trained', 'professional', 'dancers', 'however', 'could', 'really', 'sing', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'knocked', 'ballpark', 'here', 'When', 'groups', 'performed', 'sparks', 'flew', 'musical', 'mash-ups', 'made', 'movie', 'so', 'memorable', 'immediately', 'downloaded', 'soundtrack', 'watched', 'been', 'replay', 'week', 'long', 'might', 'add', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'other', 'watch', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Food', 'Thought', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'modern', 'musical', 'cappella', 'music', 'next', 'level', 'giving', 'fresh', 'modern', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'feel', 'could', 'give', 'take', 'plot', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'what', 'made', 'so', 'memorable', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'surprises', 'so', 'far', 'year', 'like', 'fun', 'funky', 'funny', 'films', 'think', ""'ll"", 'like', 'one', 'too']",N/A

We follow Becca (played by Anna Kendrick) as a freshman at Barden, a fictitional college in/near Atlanta, and she feels like a fish out of water, wanting to produce music, but eventually charmed into joining the Bellas, an all-girls acapella group. Their big rival is an all-boys acapella group, the Treble Makers, who last year won it all. We get to know the girls in the group, and they are quite the characters!There is no point in telling you how it all turns out, as it is quite predicatble, but I never lost interest as the movie unfolded. Several comments: this is the first time that Anna Kendrick fronts a movie (I saw her recently in ""End of Watch"" and of course she had a memorable breakout supporting role in ""Up In the Air"" a few years ago), and she delivers. But to be honest, the true scene-stealer is Reben Wilson as ""Fat Amy"", whom we also saw in a supporting role in ""Bridesmaids"" last year, and she is just a hoot. Who said you needed to be a 'classic' good-looking girl to be a great actress?Then there is the music, which obviously plays a huge role in the movie. I was enthralled by some of the performances, such as the very clever ""Since U Been Gone"" montage of the auditions of the Bellas in the beginning of the movie, and later again when there is an informal 'sing-off' between the acapella teams, eventually seguing into a thrilling performance of ""No Diggity"" by the Bellas. The movie is a delightful fun from start to finish. I saw this movie when it opened in limited release this past weekend, and it will open wide this coming weekend.

Laughs and a satiric wit ably presented by an engaging cast. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Victoria B, calls it ""surprisingly really funny"" and says she intends to watch it over again - which is also surprising as she shares that this type of movie is not usually one that's for her.Pitch PerfectReviewed by Victoria BVideo reviews may be found at kidsfirst dot orgI went to see Pitch Perfect and it is surprisingly really funny. I do not usually like musical types of movies, but this one was one of the best.At first I thought that this movie would be one of the ones with random outbreaks of song, but this movie has a nice storyline and it is funny. The singing is amazing. Plus, since the move is about an a capella group, it is interesting and kind of impressive to see the actors make the track to the music with their voices.This movie is about Beca (Anna Kendrick), a girl who wants more than anything to be a music producer but her dad makes her go to college first. Finally, her dad says that if she goes to college for a year, joins a club and really tries her best, he will let her drop out and go to California. This gives her some incentive to do well in school and join the Barden Bellas, the school's all-girl a capella group.The Bellas' arch rival is the all-boys group, the Trebles. Beca starts to fall for a member of the Trebles, Jesse (Skylar Astin), which is forbidden by the Bellas' uptight leader, Aubrey (played by Anna Camp). The Bellas are old-fashioned and Beca is tired of it so she quits, then she rejoins and makes the Bellas better than ever, new, and ready to win. Whether they win against the Trebles is a mystery that you'll have to watch to find out.I love this movie, and the characters are very eclectic to say the least. My favorite character is Fat Amy because she's hilarious and says whatever is on her mind, and it shows because she calls herself ""Fat"" Amy. I absolutely love this movie and will definitely be watching it repeatedly.I give it five out of five stars because I like that the actors can sing well, and the way that they make the music track with their voices is amazing. I recommend this movie for anyone who likes music and comedy, because together it is a great combination. I like that the movie is not just about the singing and that it has a good storyline as well. I recommend this movie for ages mature 12 and up because the movie has some foul language but overall is a good movie.",5,'Pitch Perfect' Is a Perfect Blend of Comedy and Music,1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,2548,"['Laughs', 'what', 'misfit', 'day', 'singing', 'movie', 'apart', 'other', 'teen', 'and/or', 'singing', 'movies', 'Laughs', 'satiric', 'wit', 'ably', 'presented', 'engaging', 'cast', 'KIDS', 'FIRST', 'Film', 'Critic', 'Victoria', 'B', 'surprisingly', 'really', 'funny', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'also', 'surprising', 'shares', 'type', 'movie', 'not', 'usually', 'one', 'her.Pitch', 'PerfectReviewed', 'Victoria', 'BVideo', 'may', 'be', 'found', 'kidsfirst', 'dot', 'orgI', 'went', 'see', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'surprisingly', 'really', 'funny', 'do', 'not', 'usually', 'like', 'musical', 'types', 'movies', 'one', 'was', 'one', 'best.At', 'first', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'ones', 'random', 'outbreaks', 'song', 'movie', 'nice', 'storyline', 'funny', 'singing', 'amazing', 'move', 'capella', 'group', 'interesting', 'kind', 'impressive', 'see', 'actors', 'make', 'track', 'music', 'voices.This', 'movie', 'Beca', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'girl', 'who', 'more', 'anything', 'be', 'music', 'producer', 'dad', 'go', 'college', 'first', 'Finally', 'dad', 'college', 'year', 'club', 'really', 'best', 'will', 'let', 'drop', 'go', 'California', 'incentive', 'do', 'well', 'school', 'join', 'Barden', 'Bellas', 'school', 'all-girl', 'capella', 'group.The', 'Bellas', 'arch', 'rival', 'all-boys', 'group', 'Trebles', 'Beca', 'fall', 'member', 'Trebles', 'Jesse', 'Skylar', 'Astin', 'forbidden', 'Bellas', 'uptight', 'leader', 'Aubrey', 'played', 'Anna', 'Camp', 'Bellas', 'are', 'old-fashioned', 'Beca', 'tired', 'then', 'Bellas', 'better', 'ever', 'new', 'ready', 'win', 'win', 'Trebles', 'mystery', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out.I', 'love', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'eclectic', 'say', 'least', 'favorite', 'character', 'Fat', 'Amy', 'hilarious', 'mind', 'Fat', 'Amy', 'absolutely', 'love', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'watching', 'give', 'five', 'five', 'stars', 'like', 'actors', 'can', 'sing', 'well', 'way', 'make', 'music', 'track', 'voices', 'amazing', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'music', 'comedy', 'together', 'great', 'combination', 'like', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'singing', 'good', 'storyline', 'well', 'recommend', 'movie', 'ages', 'mature', '12', 'up', 'movie', 'foul', 'language', 'overall', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

What I thought would be an entertaining movie turned out to be an INSTANT addition to the list of my all-time &#34;Best Movies I Ever Saw&#34; list.PitchPerfect is an extraordinary, sensational musical comedy-drama - a total surprise hit.  It has a solid plot, genius blend of actors and actresses that represent the quirks, humor, talent, personality traits that anyone can relate to - blended to present a visually artistic, inspiring, and unforgettable experience for the audience.  I have watched the movie almost 30 times already - and each time, it makes me laugh, and feel those warm fuzzies and goosebumps during the outstanding climax.It is SO hard to find an artistic and inspirational movie these days, especially regarding music and dance, portraying the depth and inspiration of a character who attains the dream of reaching their full potential of their natural talent.  This movie delivers that promise with an awe-inspiring, unexpected thrilling cilmax that'll have you cheering, jumping up and dancing with them, sharing in the joy of their success.I cannot finish my review without mentioning the following worthy &#34;traits&#34; that made this movie such a hit:1.  Rebel Wilson is FANTASTIC, hysterical, lovable - personifying the human nature to overcome one's tendency to feel self-conscious when life hasn't dealt you what society values today.  SHE is beautiful, funny, extremely self-confident, and in-touch with herself, exemplifying that we each are special, unique and very worthy if YOU believe you are.2.  Gail and John, the &#34;DJ's&#34; for the Acapella competitions are a total RIOT!  Listen carefully to their witty commentary.3.  Anna Kendrick displays yet more of her exceptional talents - not just acting, but what a voice!4.  Aubrey and Chloe - ALL the Barden Bellas have amazing voices!  The same goes for the Treble-makers.I'm so glad they are making a sequel, and so looking forward to it.  This movie is sure to be a hit for ANYONE and everyone.",5,"PitchPerfect is an extraordinary, sensational musical comedy-drama - a total surprise!",1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,2249,"['had', 'idea', 'what', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'watch', 'when', 'rented', 'PitchPerfect', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'other', 'dark', 'dramas', 'are', 'rave', 'last', 'few', 'years', ""'d"", 'just', 'read', 'Anna', 'Kenndrick', 'IMDb', 'bio', 'had', 'give', 'movie', 'try', 'What', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'INSTANT', 'addition', 'list', 'all-time', '34', 'Best', 'Movies', 'Ever', 'Saw', '34', 'list.PitchPerfect', 'extraordinary', 'sensational', 'musical', 'comedy-drama', 'total', 'surprise', 'hit', 'solid', 'plot', 'genius', 'blend', 'actors', 'actresses', 'represent', 'quirks', 'humor', 'talent', 'personality', 'traits', 'anyone', 'can', 'relate', 'blended', 'present', 'visually', 'artistic', 'inspiring', 'unforgettable', 'experience', 'audience', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'almost', '30', 'times', 'already', 'time', 'feel', 'warm', 'fuzzies', 'goosebumps', 'outstanding', 'climax.It', 'SO', 'hard', 'find', 'artistic', 'inspirational', 'movie', 'days', 'especially', 'regarding', 'music', 'dance', 'portraying', 'depth', 'inspiration', 'character', 'who', 'dream', 'reaching', 'full', 'potential', 'natural', 'talent', 'movie', 'promise', 'awe-inspiring', 'unexpected', 'thrilling', 'cilmax', ""'ll"", 'have', 'cheering', 'jumping', 'up', 'dancing', 'sharing', 'joy', 'success.I', 'can', 'not', 'finish', 'review', 'mentioning', 'following', 'worthy', '34', 'traits', '34', 'made', 'movie', 'hit:1', 'Rebel', 'Wilson', 'FANTASTIC', 'hysterical', 'lovable', 'personifying', 'human', 'nature', 'overcome', 'one', 'tendency', 'feel', 'self-conscious', 'when', 'life', ""n't"", 'dealt', 'what', 'society', 'values', 'today', 'SHE', 'beautiful', 'funny', 'extremely', 'self-confident', 'in-touch', 'exemplifying', 'are', 'special', 'unique', 'very', 'worthy', 'YOU', 'believe', 'are.2', 'Gail', 'John', '34', 'DJ', '34', 'Acapella', 'competitions', 'are', 'total', 'RIOT', 'Listen', 'carefully', 'witty', 'commentary.3', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'yet', 'more', 'exceptional', 'talents', 'not', 'just', 'acting', 'what', 'voice', '4', 'Aubrey', 'Chloe', 'Barden', 'Bellas', 'have', 'amazing', 'voices', 'same', 'Treble-makers.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'are', 'making', 'sequel', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'sure', 'be', 'hit', 'ANYONE', 'everyone']",N/A

Ettinger ""rme1963""","[0, 0]","Overall, 'Pitch Perfect' is a perfectly enjoyable movie, if not horribly predictable.You have the hyper-stick up the a** leader, the rebel, the outcasts.  You have the meek, the poor song and choreography choices. You have the malcontent who can't make friends and doesn't want to be there.You've seen it all before.  Yet it kind of works on its own - that is if you're not expecting anything original.I get the director and writer have to make the point that the female group is in a rut they can't get out of - but it doesn't have to be with the same song. I would have preferred they did more scenes of the Riff-Off or the shower singing where they kind of let loose a little more.Frustration for me in a movie are the unexplained - the story line that isn't resolved (the ultimate goal of the main character), or the animosity of the leader of the singing group to the new talent.  There is no explained reason she dislikes her, so the reconciliation is just as lame.What makes the movie is the talent. Anna Kendricks is ok (though didn't she have the same kind of movie in 'Camp'?).  Rebel Wilson is spot-on.  And Elizabeth Banks is always better than what she is in (though she did produce this).  She gets extra points for having been in an all female acapella group called the 'Minstrel Cycles'.It's a fine waste of 90 minutes, but if you're looking for anything groundbreaking - keep looking.",3,Glee meets Bring It On,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,1401,"['Overall', ""'Pitch"", 'Perfect', 'perfectly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'not', 'horribly', 'predictable.You', 'have', 'hyper-stick', 'a**', 'leader', 'rebel', 'outcasts', 'have', 'meek', 'poor', 'song', 'choreography', 'choices', 'have', 'malcontent', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'friends', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there.You', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'kind', 'works', 'own', ""'re"", 'not', 'expecting', 'anything', 'original.I', 'get', 'director', 'writer', 'have', 'make', 'point', 'female', 'group', 'rut', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'same', 'song', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'did', 'more', 'scenes', 'Riff-Off', 'shower', 'singing', 'where', 'kind', 'let', 'loose', 'little', 'more.Frustration', 'movie', 'are', 'unexplained', 'story', 'line', ""n't"", 'resolved', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'main', 'character', 'animosity', 'leader', 'singing', 'group', 'new', 'talent', 'explained', 'reason', 'reconciliation', 'just', 'lame.What', 'movie', 'talent', 'Anna', 'Kendricks', 'ok', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'kind', 'movie', ""'Camp"", 'Rebel', 'Wilson', 'spot-on', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'always', 'better', 'what', 'did', 'produce', 'extra', 'points', 'having', 'been', 'female', 'acapella', 'group', 'called', ""'Minstrel"", ""Cycles'.It"", 'fine', 'waste', '90', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'looking', 'anything', 'groundbreaking', 'keep', 'looking']",N/A

I doubt that the music actually had much true a capella authenticity in its recording, but it generally sounds good and works as fantasy ear-candy. Other than that, however, this is one of the worst films that I have ever seen, in my personal opinion. Someone with different tastes than mine might find a lot here to like, but I find virtually no redeeming value whatsoever, and surprisingly little in the way of actually funny humor.The dialog is extremely lazy and clich&eacute;d. The characters are extremely stereotypical (in the offensive, one-dimensional sense, not the effectively simple archetype sense) and clich&eacute;d. The plot is predictable. The music, while fairly decent on the whole, is rarely transcendent, edgy or spectacular in my opinion. It is okay, but this film would have benefited from it being spectacular. The humor is often gross-out and/or highly sexualized. That may or may not be objectionable or palatable depending on the viewer. The more universal problem with the humor, again in my personal opinion, is that it is rarely funny. The exception to that is Rebel Wilson, who is endlessly entertaining, but she alone cannot save Pitch Perfect, try though she might.Is this film a satire? Maybe it is, but I would suggest that it fails to be an effective satire just as it fails to be an effective straight film. Nearly everything about it is lazy, cheap and uninspired.

The main focus is on Rebecca (Anna Kendrick from &#34;Twilight&#34;). She is the daughter of a college professor who wants to be a music producer and arranger. She is pursued by Jesse (Skylar Astin) who wants to score movies. They end up in rival groups who all seem to have pun names, i.e. &#34;The Treble Makers&#34; or &#34;The Minstrel Cycles&#34;. The language they speak to each other is also punny such as getting &#34;pitch slapped.&#34;The female group is lead by Aubrey (Anna Camp) who wants to do the same songs over and over again to the dismay of Rebecca and the snarky judges. The movie is predictable and pretentious. It is a film designed for a female teen audience, although I was able to enjoy it as well.

When I get around to putting pen to paper, I have to think if I have anything to say about a film and then decide which to write about. Oddly, every time I think about writing reviews for the current crop of films, I forget that I have seen ""Pitch Perfect"", the new film starring Anna Kendrick (""Twilight"", ""Up in the Air"") as the newest member of an all-female college acapela club.I'm not sure why that is. ""Pitch"" is a perfectly enjoyable way to spend a few hours. A lot of it works, there are many laughs, some of the music is very good. But I think that for almost every good thing, there is an equally noticeable problem.Kendrick, ready to break free from brooding vampires, headlines as Beca, a brooding freshman attending Borden University. She is going to college because her dad is a professor there and insists she give it a try before heading to Los Angeles to make it big as a DJ peddling her mash-ups. She soon discovers the Borden Bellas, an all-female acapela group fighting their way back to Nationals after a disastrous performance the previous year. Beca joins the group and pushes her mash-ups; she is all about trying something new, something different.The new head of the group, Aubrey (Anna Camp, TV's ""The Good Wife"", ""Mad Men"", ""The Help"") wants to maintain the group's traditional ways and songs. Her right hand, Chloe (Brittany Snow, ""Hairspray (2007)"", TV's ""Harry's Law"") is more on the fence, but gives in to her friend's pressure to remain tried and true.Because of the Bella's recent performance and graduating seniors, they have to start from scratch and bring in an entirely new team. They find a black lesbian, a promiscuous girl, a shy, demure Asian girl, a couple of less distinctive and less interesting girls and Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson, ""Bridesmaids""). In other words, they find characters defined by a single characteristic, making them stereotypes. With one exception.Rebel Wilson is a stand-out as the self-proclaimed Fat Amy. Her jokes and funny bits zig zag back and forth between self-deprecating humor and jokes others make about her. You can tell the jokes made by others sting a little, but she is also used to them, aware of them, and has learned to recover from them very quickly. And her self-deprecating humor is a form of armor, protection from the mean-spiritedness of others.The Bella's rivals, an all-male acapela group, are currently number #1. They do modern stuff and never repeat a song, leading them to enjoy a lot of success. Jesse (Skylar Astin) and Benji (Ben Platt), two roommates and new students, both want to join, but Jesse is chosen. He also has eyes for Beca.You can probably connect many of the dots and guess many of the jokes.Elizabeth Banks, one of the film's producers, appears with John Michael Higgins (TV's ""Happily Divorced"", ""Best in Show"", ""The Ugly Truth"") as the television hosts of the Nationals. These roles are pretty much the exact role Higgins has played many times before, in ""Best of Show"", ""For Your Consideration"", usually with Jane Lynch in a film written and directed by Christopher Guest. It was a funny bit the first time, but each time it is repeated it becomes less interesting and even a little annoying. Now, it just appears tired and recycled.This brings me to my big complaint about ""Perfect"". The filmmakers seem to reach the limit of their abilities after the few good things and fill in the blanks with recycled material. The bits with Higgins and Banks stand out like a sore thumb. And because she is one of the Producers, it seems like she could've, should've said ""this seems very familiar. How can we take this somewhere new?"" But she didn't and it just seems so similar. There should almost be a clich&eacute; named for these characters. The snarky co-hosts. Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones even did a variation on this bit, but with more sarcasm, in ""The Hunger Games"". The additional level of snarkiness makes it a fitting addition to the futuristic survival tale. It makes it a little more interesting and brings a slightly different slant to the rote idea.Also, there seem to be a lot of missed opportunities. Beca and Jesse both go to work at the college radio station, a story idea meant to force them to spend a lot of time together, forcing them to deal with their growing attraction. But the station is run by a hunky British DJ. (Freddie Stroma, the ""Harry Potter"" films) who doesn't really seem to serve any purpose what so ever. He doesn't even do the most clich&eacute;d thing imaginable and cause Jesse to become jealous.All of the supporting characters amount to little more than stereotypes. There is so much opportunity to explore a little more of these characters that it seems a shame everything is reduced to a simple one-liner. Very often, the one-liner is repeated.The music is quite good. Kendrick and her female counterparts seem ready to break out of their mold at any point, held back only by Aubrey's insistence on tradition. There are a number of occasions when they aren't competing, allowing Beca more leeway and she breaks out into a modern song. But every time they go to competition, it is the same old, same old. The male group, the more polished performers, more willing and able to take chances and perform new material, seem more modern and daring. Their songs also provide a nice counterpoint to the more formal, old-fashioned arrangements of the Bellas. You know the Bellas will eventually change their routing and when they do, the performance is pretty great.As good as the music is, it doesn't really do anything better than a good episode of ""Glee"". When the television show if firing on all cylinders, the musical performances are memorable, the characters explore real emotions and real problems, and this might provide some genuinely moving moments. Granted, this seems to be happening less frequently this season, but it does happen.Ultimately, ""Pitch"" doesn't separate itself enough from a good episode of ""Glee"" to make it worth spending $13 for a full-price ticket.

1568567,A26MQ4YGVS5CC2,B008JFUUIA,Todd Bartholomew,"[1, 1]","In the previews it was hard to know what to make of ""Pitch Perfect""; was it a film length rip off of ""Glee"", something similar toDrumlineorBring It On: In It To Win It?  With a mostly no-name cast would it be any good?  I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised by not only how good it was, but how funny, albeit it in a slightly over-the-top way.  ""Pitch Perfect"" mines the trope of college life with incoming freshmen Beca (Anna Kendrick) and Jesse (Skylar Astin) at the fictional Barden University and their search to fit in on campus.  Beca aspires to become a successful record producer in LA and Jesse wants to score movies.  This plays out against a fierce competition on campus between four different acapella groups vying to attract top talent.  The all-girl Bellas are seeking to recover from a disastrous flop at nationals where they literally and figuratively blew chunks, leaving the all-male Treble Makers to clinch yet another win.  But the talent pool for the Bellas isn't as deep as they hoped, especially given their tendency towards model-thin glamazons who can sing.  The talent that shows up is almost out of central casting, the quiet Asian girl, the loud brash plus-sized girl, and so on.  Reluctantly Beca decides to try out and becomes part of the oddball ensemble and unfortunately for her Jesse joins the Trebles, setting up a problem as the Bellas aren't allowed to date or fool around with any of the Trebles lest they be kicked out of the group.  Tensions come in the will they, won't they dynamic between Beca and Jesse and as the Bellas desperately try and come together as a group, as often failing as they succeed.  There are a lot of hilarious moments in the films and the cast is, to use an appropriate term, pitch perfect.  Adam DeVine (of Comedy Central's ""Workaholics"") is outstanding, all swagger and bravado, as the leader of the Trebles and pretty much steals the show as does Rebel Wilson (Bridesmaids) as the lusty, self-confident, and uninhibited Fat Amy. The script and book by Kay Cannon and Mickey Rapkin keeps the laughs coming and some of the scenes are truly hilarious.  The production numbers are also well done and rival anything you would see on ""Glee"" and contrary to what other reviewers have said I thought the singing was quite good.  Sure, the script relies on some stereotyped characters and stock casting types, it's a bit screwball and at times over the top, but it's a fantasy, not reality.So is ""Pitch Perfect"" good?  I'd give that an almost unqualified yes.  Don't expect that this will be one of the best or funniest movies you'll ever see and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  The ensemble cast works so well you'd almost assume these folks have been working together for ages as they have a wonderfully natural chemistry and play well off each other.  The characters they create are eminently believable even if they're amped up for comedic effect.  What you'll see here is the next generation of top comedic actors and I have a hunch many here will go on to much bigger things.  My hunch is we'll be looking back at this in a few years as the launch pad for a generation of sharp comedic talent.",5,So much better than I expected!,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,3182,"['previews', 'was', 'hard', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'was', 'film', 'length', 'rip', 'Glee', 'something', 'similar', 'toDrumlineorBring', 'Win', 'mostly', 'no-name', 'cast', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'went', 'low', 'expectations', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'how', 'funny', 'slightly', 'over-the-top', 'way', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'trope', 'college', 'life', 'incoming', 'freshmen', 'Beca', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'Jesse', 'Skylar', 'Astin', 'fictional', 'Barden', 'University', 'search', 'fit', 'campus', 'Beca', 'become', 'successful', 'record', 'producer', 'LA', 'Jesse', 'score', 'movies', 'out', 'fierce', 'competition', 'campus', 'four', 'different', 'acapella', 'groups', 'vying', 'attract', 'top', 'talent', 'all-girl', 'Bellas', 'are', 'seeking', 'recover', 'disastrous', 'flop', 'nationals', 'where', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'blew', 'chunks', 'leaving', 'all-male', 'Treble', 'Makers', 'clinch', 'yet', 'win', 'talent', 'pool', 'Bellas', ""n't"", 'as', 'deep', 'hoped', 'especially', 'given', 'tendency', 'model-thin', 'glamazons', 'who', 'can', 'sing', 'talent', 'up', 'almost', 'central', 'casting', 'quiet', 'Asian', 'girl', 'loud', 'brash', 'plus-sized', 'girl', 'so', 'Reluctantly', 'Beca', 'try', 'out', 'part', 'oddball', 'ensemble', 'unfortunately', 'Jesse', 'Trebles', 'setting', 'up', 'problem', 'Bellas', 'are', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'date', 'fool', 'Trebles', 'lest', 'be', 'kicked', 'group', 'Tensions', 'come', 'will', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dynamic', 'Beca', 'Jesse', 'Bellas', 'desperately', 'try', 'come', 'together', 'group', 'often', 'failing', 'succeed', 'are', 'lot', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'films', 'cast', 'use', 'appropriate', 'term', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'Adam', 'DeVine', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Workaholics', 'outstanding', 'swagger', 'bravado', 'leader', 'Trebles', 'pretty', 'much', 'steals', 'show', 'Rebel', 'Wilson', 'Bridesmaids', 'lusty', 'self-confident', 'uninhibited', 'Fat', 'Amy', 'script', 'book', 'Kay', 'Cannon', 'Mickey', 'Rapkin', 'laughs', 'coming', 'scenes', 'are', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'production', 'numbers', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'rival', 'anything', 'would', 'see', 'Glee', 'contrary', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'thought', 'singing', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Sure', 'script', 'relies', 'stereotyped', 'characters', 'stock', 'casting', 'types', 'bit', 'screwball', 'times', 'top', 'fantasy', 'not', 'reality.So', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'good', ""'d"", 'give', 'almost', 'unqualified', 'yes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'funniest', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'works', 'so', 'well', ""'d"", 'almost', 'assume', 'folks', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'together', 'ages', 'have', 'wonderfully', 'natural', 'chemistry', 'play', 'well', 'other', 'characters', 'create', 'are', 'eminently', 'believable', 'even', ""'re"", 'amped', 'up', 'comedic', 'effect', 'What', ""'ll"", 'see', 'here', 'next', 'generation', 'top', 'comedic', 'actors', 'have', 'hunch', 'many', 'here', 'will', 'go', 'much', 'bigger', 'things', 'hunch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'looking', 'back', 'few', 'years', 'launch', 'pad', 'generation', 'sharp', 'comedic', 'talent']",N/A

Would you simply slack off and plan the future you really want? Or would you find a group of students anxious to have you and stick it out?During the opening scene of the film, we're introduced to the Bellas, an all-girl a capella group from the fictional Barden College who are performing at Lincoln Center. During a solo, Aubrey (played by Anna Camp) vomits on stage and turns the Bellas into a national joke. The following semester, new student Beca Mitchell (played by Anna Kendrick) meets Aubrey (Camp) and Chloe (played by Brittany Snow) who are desperate to rebound from their previous embarrassment. Becca (Kendrick), however, is only biding time in college to please her father while composing mash-ups on the laptop in her dorm room. Conversely, Fat Amy (played by Australian comedic actress Rebel Wilson) is confident in her singing ability and anxious to join the Bellas, who used to be composed solely of traditionally beautiful co-eds with vocal talent. Then, while singing in the shower, Beca's talent is discovered by her dorm-mate Chloe. While Beca is noticeably unnerved by the uninvited presence of another nude member of the student body, Chloe refuses to leave until Beca joins her in song. After discovering the fact that Becca has yet to attend a single class, her father (a professor at Barden played by John Benjamin Hickey) tells her that if she wants him to pay her way to Los Angeles she must attend her classes and join at least one student organization. Despite performing Cups at her audition, Beca's invited to join the Bellas along with Fat Amy and the nearly inaudible Lily (played by Hana Mae Lee). And so began a new season for the Bellas under the dictatorial direction the veteran performer with a nervous stomach, Aubrey.Now, I wasn't expecting much a movie intent on lampooning something whose ridiculous nature is pretty self-evident. Still, there were things about it that I liked. Beca's unfiltered contempt for college clich&eacute;s and the majority of the student body inspires a lot of laughs.

1568581,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B008JFUUIA,Turfseer,"[0, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Pitch Perfect is set at the fictional Barden University, featuring the rivalry between an all-male a capella group, 'The Treblemakers' and an all-female group, 'The Barden Bellas'. The protagonist is Beca Mitchell, played by the talented Amy Kendrick. Beca wants to be a DJ and move out to LA, much to the chagrin of her father, who is a professor at Barden. He strikes a deal with Beca, that she must participate in one college activity and if after one year, she doesn't find it fulfilling, he'll finance her trip to the west coast.'Pitch Perfect' is most successful, when the music groups are performing their a capella numbers. The film begins with the introduction of The Treblemakers and The Barden Bellas at the national a capella finals at Lincoln Center in NYC, during the previous semester. Aubrey, the strident co-leader of the Bellas, ruins their chances when she throws up on stage (the workaholic and seemingly in control Aubrey, obviously can't stand the pressure).Act 2 begins nicely when the a capella auditions begin at Barden, each candidate singing parts from Kelly Clarkson's 'Since U Been Gone'. Desperate for members, the Bellas end up selecting a group of odd balls, including Beca, who comes in late for the audition, only to wow the audience by singing a folk-rock tune, with a cup as a percussive accompaniment. There's also 'Fat Amy' (Rebel Wilson from 'Bridesmaids'), Stacie, a self-admitted nymphomaniac, Cynthia-Rose, a lesbian with a gambling problem and Lilly, who sings so softly, no one can hear her (she later is revealed to have talent as a beat boxer).There are a number of scenes in 'Pitch Perfect', where the film's scenarist, Kay Cannon, veers away from the music and bores us with dialogue heavy narrative. A good ten minutes could have been cut from those scenes which involve the initiation of the new members of each a capella group as well as the following scene, some kind of 'mixer', where the boys and the girls get a chance to interact.It's at this point where the love interest begins in earnest, with Beca rejecting the advances of Jesse, who has just been selected to be one of the new members of the Trebelmakers. Jesse initially bores Beca with some dull zombie conversation but eventually woos her by appealing to her romantic, visual nature (first, he hides his face with a set of old record albums; later he convinces her to watch old movies (which is not her thing), especially the 80s film, 'The Breakfast Club'. In the finale, Beca utilizes the 80s hit, 'Don't You (Forget about me), the key song in 'The Breakfast Club', which helps the Bellas win the final competition.The Bellas manage to get by in the regional competition, after one of their competitors, lamely feature Muppets, as part of their performance. The scuffle between the Treblemakers and another group afterward, goes on a little too long, and Beca ends up getting arrested after sticking up for her schoolmates. Jesse also infuriates Beca after he calls her father. The conflict between Beca and Aubrey escalates, as the latter wants her mates to wear the same uniforms and perform the same songs, they've used before.The dark moment of Act 2, occurs when the Bellas lose in the semi-finals. Beca infuriates Aubrey because she did a little improvisation during their final number and quits the group. Beca must do some soul-searching and she finds it watching 'The Breakfast Club'. She's now receptive to her father (no longer rebelling) and agrees to rejoin the Bellas.It should be noted that Cannon's screenplay contains two moments of outright political incorrectness. First there's Beca's dour Korean roommate, who for some reason seems to dislike non-Asians. Then there's the black lead singer of the Footnotes, who's disqualified from the finals because he's not a high school student. This is the reason why the Bellas get a second chance to sing at Lincoln Center in the finals.Meanwhile, there's an additional sub-plot which I failed to mention before. Bumper, the Treblemaker's egotistical lead singer, quits after being offered a gig as a backup singer to John Mayer. That allows, Jesse's quirky roommate, Ben, a magician, to realize his dream of singing for the Treblemakers.The finale isn't very hard to figure out. Beca is appointed the leader of the Bellas and they adopt her new costumes and arrangements. In a rousing face-off, both groups perform magically, but the Bellas have the edge, with Beca leading the way.'Pitch Perfect' is an enjoyable, musical treat, featuring some fantastic a capella arrangements of both contemporary hits as well as classics from an earlier time in the rock/pop era. As for the story, it goes on for about twenty minutes too long and some additional, judicious editing, could have markedly improved the storyline. I would recommend seeing 'Pitch Perfect' and purchasing the soundtrack.",3,The a capella music is great but the story only serviceable and a trifle too long,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,4903,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Pitch', 'Perfect', 'set', 'fictional', 'Barden', 'University', 'featuring', 'rivalry', 'all-male', 'capella', 'group', 'Treblemakers', 'all-female', 'group', 'Barden', 'Bellas', 'protagonist', 'Beca', 'Mitchell', 'played', 'talented', 'Amy', 'Kendrick', 'Beca', 'be', 'DJ', 'move', 'out', 'LA', 'much', 'chagrin', 'father', 'who', 'professor', 'Barden', 'deal', 'Beca', 'must', 'participate', 'one', 'college', 'activity', 'one', 'year', ""n't"", 'find', 'fulfilling', ""'ll"", 'finance', 'trip', 'west', 'coast', ""'Pitch"", 'Perfect', 'most', 'successful', 'when', 'music', 'groups', 'are', 'performing', 'capella', 'numbers', 'film', 'introduction', 'Treblemakers', 'Barden', 'Bellas', 'national', 'capella', 'finals', 'Lincoln', 'Center', 'NYC', 'previous', 'semester', 'Aubrey', 'strident', 'co-leader', 'Bellas', 'chances', 'when', 'up', 'stage', 'workaholic', 'seemingly', 'control', 'Aubrey', 'obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'pressure', '2', 'begins', 'nicely', 'when', 'capella', 'auditions', 'begin', 'Barden', 'candidate', 'singing', 'parts', 'Kelly', 'Clarkson', ""'Since"", 'U', 'Been', 'Gone', 'Desperate', 'members', 'Bellas', 'end', 'up', 'selecting', 'group', 'odd', 'balls', 'including', 'Beca', 'who', 'late', 'audition', 'only', 'wow', 'audience', 'singing', 'folk-rock', 'tune', 'cup', 'percussive', 'accompaniment', 'also', ""'Fat"", 'Amy', 'Rebel', 'Wilson', ""'Bridesmaids"", 'Stacie', 'self-admitted', 'nymphomaniac', 'Cynthia-Rose', 'lesbian', 'gambling', 'problem', 'Lilly', 'who', 'so', 'softly', 'one', 'can', 'hear', 'later', 'revealed', 'have', 'talent', 'beat', 'boxer', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', ""'Pitch"", 'Perfect', 'where', 'film', 'scenarist', 'Kay', 'Cannon', 'veers', 'away', 'music', 'dialogue', 'heavy', 'narrative', 'good', 'ten', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'scenes', 'involve', 'initiation', 'new', 'members', 'capella', 'group', 'as', 'well', 'following', 'scene', 'kind', ""'mixer"", 'where', 'boys', 'girls', 'get', 'chance', 'interact.It', 'point', 'where', 'love', 'interest', 'earnest', 'Beca', 'rejecting', 'advances', 'Jesse', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'selected', 'be', 'one', 'new', 'members', 'Trebelmakers', 'Jesse', 'initially', 'Beca', 'dull', 'zombie', 'conversation', 'eventually', 'woos', 'appealing', 'romantic', 'visual', 'nature', 'first', 'face', 'set', 'old', 'record', 'albums', 'later', 'watch', 'old', 'movies', 'not', 'thing', 'especially', '80s', 'film', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'finale', 'Beca', '80s', 'hit', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'Forget', 'key', 'song', ""'The"", 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'Bellas', 'win', 'final', 'competition.The', 'Bellas', 'manage', 'get', 'regional', 'competition', 'one', 'competitors', 'lamely', 'feature', 'Muppets', 'part', 'performance', 'scuffle', 'Treblemakers', 'group', 'afterward', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'Beca', 'up', 'getting', 'arrested', 'sticking', 'up', 'schoolmates', 'Jesse', 'also', 'Beca', 'father', 'conflict', 'Beca', 'Aubrey', 'latter', 'mates', 'wear', 'same', 'uniforms', 'perform', 'same', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'used', 'before.The', 'dark', 'moment', 'Act', '2', 'when', 'Bellas', 'lose', 'semi-finals', 'Beca', 'Aubrey', 'did', 'little', 'improvisation', 'final', 'number', 'group', 'Beca', 'must', 'do', 'soul-searching', 'watching', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'now', 'receptive', 'father', 'no', 'longer', 'rebelling', 'rejoin', 'Bellas.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'Cannon', 'screenplay', 'two', 'moments', 'outright', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'First', 'Beca', 'dour', 'Korean', 'roommate', 'who', 'reason', 'dislike', 'non-Asians', 'Then', 'black', 'lead', 'singer', 'Footnotes', 'who', 'disqualified', 'finals', 'not', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'reason', 'why', 'Bellas', 'get', 'second', 'chance', 'sing', 'Lincoln', 'Center', 'finals.Meanwhile', 'additional', 'sub-plot', 'failed', 'mention', 'Bumper', 'Treblemaker', 'egotistical', 'lead', 'singer', 'quits', 'being', 'offered', 'gig', 'backup', 'singer', 'John', 'Mayer', 'Jesse', 'quirky', 'roommate', 'Ben', 'magician', 'realize', 'dream', 'singing', 'Treblemakers.The', 'finale', ""n't"", 'very', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'Beca', 'appointed', 'leader', 'Bellas', 'adopt', 'new', 'costumes', 'arrangements', 'rousing', 'face-off', 'groups', 'perform', 'magically', 'Bellas', 'have', 'edge', 'Beca', 'leading', 'way', ""'Pitch"", 'Perfect', 'enjoyable', 'musical', 'treat', 'featuring', 'fantastic', 'capella', 'arrangements', 'contemporary', 'hits', 'as', 'well', 'classics', 'earlier', 'time', 'rock/pop', 'era', 'story', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'additional', 'judicious', 'editing', 'could', 'have', 'markedly', 'improved', 'storyline', 'would', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'Perfect', 'purchasing', 'soundtrack']",N/A

1568607,AP3B615GM191G,B008JFUUIA,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","Despite the fact that ""Pitch Perfect"" doesn't exactly fall into my preferred film genre, I rented it because I have thoroughly enjoyed previous flicks featuring Anna Kendrick (""Up In The Air"", ""50/50"") and figured that her presence in this one might lend it more legitimacy.  Unfortunately, all it did was leave me wondering why Kendrick would lend her presence to such a cliched, pointless film.For a basic plot summary, ""Pitch Perfect"" sees college newbie Becca (Kendrick) trying to fit in at her new campus while also pursuing a potential career as a music DJ.  On some advice from her father, Becca joins a collegiate a cappella singing group in hopes of making friends and living the ""college life"".The glaring weakness of this film is that director Jason Moore should have made it a bit more of a serious effort in accordance with Kendrick's acting style.  Usually, Kendrick is so cute and likeable that audiences cannot help but sympathize and identify with her.  In ""Pitch Perfect"", though, all the crazy proceedings around Kendrick's characters are too ridiculous to even let the audiences think they should be taking themselves seriously whatsoever.Basically, I just wonder why-oh-why did the film's producers try to follow the ""Bring It On"" cheerleading-esque approach to this movie.  Rebel Wilson's ""Fat Amy"" character is about the only semblance of the film that actually made me laugh a time or two.  Otherwise, it is just a collection of shock humor (vomit jokes run the course of the movie) and sight gags.The only reason I give ""Pitch Perfect"" two stars is because the musical numbers are fun and some of ""Fat Amy's"" one-liners are legitimately hilarious.  However, unless you REALLY, REALLY enjoyed the ""Bring It On"" style of making a movie, you'll want to discard this one fairly quickly from your film library.",2,This Movie Is Beneath Anna Kendrick,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",2013,1830,"['fact', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fall', 'preferred', 'film', 'genre', 'rented', 'have', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'previous', 'flicks', 'featuring', 'Anna', 'Kendrick', 'Up', 'Air', '50/50', 'figured', 'presence', 'one', 'might', 'lend', 'more', 'legitimacy', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'was', 'leave', 'wondering', 'why', 'Kendrick', 'would', 'lend', 'presence', 'cliched', 'pointless', 'film.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'college', 'newbie', 'Becca', 'Kendrick', 'trying', 'fit', 'new', 'campus', 'also', 'pursuing', 'potential', 'career', 'music', 'DJ', 'advice', 'father', 'Becca', 'collegiate', 'cappella', 'singing', 'group', 'hopes', 'making', 'friends', 'living', 'college', 'life', 'glaring', 'weakness', 'film', 'director', 'Jason', 'Moore', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'bit', 'more', 'serious', 'effort', 'accordance', 'Kendrick', 'acting', 'style', 'Usually', 'Kendrick', 'so', 'cute', 'likeable', 'audiences', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'sympathize', 'identify', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'crazy', 'proceedings', 'Kendrick', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'even', 'let', 'audiences', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'taking', 'seriously', 'whatsoever.Basically', 'just', 'wonder', 'why-oh-why', 'did', 'film', 'producers', 'try', 'follow', 'Bring', 'cheerleading-esque', 'approach', 'movie', 'Rebel', 'Wilson', 'Fat', 'Amy', 'character', 'only', 'semblance', 'film', 'actually', 'made', 'time', 'two', 'Otherwise', 'just', 'collection', 'shock', 'humor', 'vomit', 'jokes', 'run', 'course', 'movie', 'sight', 'gags.The', 'only', 'reason', 'give', 'Pitch', 'Perfect', 'two', 'stars', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'fun', 'Fat', 'Amy', 'one-liners', 'are', 'legitimately', 'hilarious', 'However', 'REALLY', 'REALLY', 'enjoyed', 'Bring', 'style', 'making', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'discard', 'one', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'film', 'library']",N/A
