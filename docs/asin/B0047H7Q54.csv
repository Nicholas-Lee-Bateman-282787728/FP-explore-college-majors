1388519,A1OEIXKYL93XTA,B0047H7Q54,H. Rieseck,"[11, 15]","Growing up in New England I was taught about the Civil War from a pro-Unionist viewpoint. We looked at why the Civil War was fought, some of the big name battles, and the outcomes - but we never really looked at the people involved. I think that the people are left out of school lessons a lot of times, and these could be the things that teach you the most. This episode of American Experience really helped me to see who Robert E. Lee was and why he did many of the things that he did.American Experience does a very good job of setting the tone and hooking the viewer right from the start, and this was no exception. I found it ironic that they opened with Robert E. Lee taking an oath at West Point to support and uphold the United States and the army. They carried this theme all the way to the wrap up of the episode where he is giving an oath after the surrender to support the Union and the United States. It really brought you full circle.This episode's central focus was the man himself, the decisions he made, why he made them, and how they affected him, rather than an emphasis on battles. Several battles certainly were featured, but it was less about the minutiae of how they happened and more of how they affected Lee. Through this episode you really start to get a sense of how much of a struggle fighting this war was for Lee. He initially wanted to sit out the war because he was torn between his honor and his country and didn't want to destroy either.Most of the episode's visuals were made up of portraits of Lee and co, drawings, maps and interviewing experts. Overlaid across these were many quotes by Lee that supported their points. There were also some great sound effects used for the war sections.The one thing that I would have liked to have seen more of was his upbringing before he attended West Point. There was a little bit about his parents and wife mentioned, but I think having a little more of his early life would have aided the ""making of the man"" a little more.Overall, another very good outing by American Experience.",4,The Making of the Man,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,2058,"['Growing', 'up', 'New', 'England', 'was', 'taught', 'Civil', 'War', 'pro-Unionist', 'viewpoint', 'looked', 'why', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'fought', 'big', 'name', 'battles', 'outcomes', 'never', 'really', 'looked', 'people', 'involved', 'think', 'people', 'are', 'left', 'school', 'lessons', 'lot', 'times', 'could', 'be', 'things', 'teach', 'most', 'episode', 'American', 'Experience', 'really', 'helped', 'see', 'who', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'was', 'why', 'did', 'many', 'things', 'did.American', 'Experience', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'setting', 'tone', 'hooking', 'viewer', 'right', 'start', 'was', 'exception', 'found', 'opened', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'taking', 'oath', 'West', 'Point', 'support', 'uphold', 'United', 'States', 'army', 'carried', 'theme', 'way', 'wrap', 'episode', 'where', 'giving', 'oath', 'surrender', 'support', 'Union', 'United', 'States', 'really', 'brought', 'full', 'circle.This', 'episode', 'central', 'focus', 'was', 'man', 'decisions', 'made', 'why', 'made', 'how', 'affected', 'rather', 'emphasis', 'battles', 'Several', 'battles', 'certainly', 'were', 'featured', 'was', 'less', 'minutiae', 'how', 'happened', 'more', 'how', 'affected', 'Lee', 'episode', 'really', 'start', 'get', 'sense', 'how', 'much', 'struggle', 'fighting', 'war', 'was', 'Lee', 'initially', 'wanted', 'sit', 'out', 'war', 'was', 'torn', 'honor', 'country', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'destroy', 'either.Most', 'episode', 'visuals', 'were', 'made', 'portraits', 'Lee', 'co', 'drawings', 'maps', 'interviewing', 'experts', 'Overlaid', 'were', 'many', 'quotes', 'Lee', 'supported', 'points', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'sound', 'effects', 'used', 'war', 'sections.The', 'one', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'was', 'upbringing', 'attended', 'West', 'Point', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'parents', 'wife', 'mentioned', 'think', 'having', 'little', 'more', 'early', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'aided', 'making', 'man', 'little', 'more.Overall', 'very', 'good', 'outing', 'American', 'Experience']",N/A

Now American Experience takes a new look at his life and career, recognizing that truth while examining some of his inner drives and motives. What this biography demonstrates is, that like most great men, Lee is something of a conundrum, a bundle of contradictions.  Educated at West Point, he made the army his career, taking a loyalty oath that he expected never to deny. Nevertheless, when the War Between the States erupted, it took him less than a day to reject the command of the army, and the country, that made him. Similarly, though he loved his wife, Mary Custis, and their seven children, Lee dedicated most of his time and energy to career rather than family. Even when defeat became incontrovertibly inevitable, Lee doggedly continued to fight, a choice that cost thousands of lives and prolonged the suffering of hundreds of thousands. Finally, following the surrender of the Confederacy, Lee publicly supported a peaceful re-union of the states, while privately unable to reconcile himself to the loss of the Great Cause, dying a bitter and despondent man a mere five years later.Some time is also devoted to Lee the mythic hero. That the southern states, humiliated by defeat, aggrandized and romanticized Lee and the Lost Cause, is recounted, but the role that this idolatry played in hindering the nation's reunification is largely ignored.",4,"The ""Marble Man""",1291680000,"12 7, 2010",2010,1423,"['Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'arguably', 'America', 'greatest', 'military', 'commander', 'Now', 'American', 'Experience', 'new', 'look', 'life', 'career', 'recognizing', 'truth', 'examining', 'inner', 'drives', 'motives', 'What', 'biography', 'most', 'great', 'men', 'Lee', 'something', 'conundrum', 'bundle', 'contradictions', 'Educated', 'West', 'Point', 'made', 'army', 'career', 'taking', 'loyalty', 'oath', 'expected', 'never', 'deny', 'Nevertheless', 'when', 'War', 'Between', 'States', 'erupted', 'took', 'less', 'day', 'reject', 'command', 'army', 'country', 'made', 'Similarly', 'loved', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Custis', 'seven', 'children', 'Lee', 'dedicated', 'most', 'time', 'energy', 'career', 'rather', 'family', 'Even', 'when', 'defeat', 'became', 'incontrovertibly', 'inevitable', 'Lee', 'doggedly', 'continued', 'fight', 'choice', 'cost', 'thousands', 'lives', 'prolonged', 'suffering', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'Finally', 'following', 'surrender', 'Confederacy', 'Lee', 'publicly', 'supported', 'peaceful', 're-union', 'states', 'privately', 'unable', 'reconcile', 'loss', 'Great', 'Cause', 'dying', 'bitter', 'despondent', 'man', 'mere', 'five', 'years', 'later.Some', 'time', 'also', 'devoted', 'Lee', 'mythic', 'hero', 'southern', 'states', 'humiliated', 'defeat', 'aggrandized', 'romanticized', 'Lee', 'Lost', 'Cause', 'recounted', 'role', 'idolatry', 'played', 'hindering', 'nation', 'reunification', 'largely', 'ignored']",N/A

Lee to play himself.I had no idea,however, of Lee's strategic mastery initially demonstrated in Mexican War -- and up against such odds during Civil War, where he had an (ignored) massive heart attack in the field, testimony to his renowned ""capacity for sacrifice"".A few of his aides saw deep sorrow in his eyes as well, overlooking the carnage the Union troops had done to his army.The film ends with a stunning quotation from Robert E. Lee, exposing his ability to reflect on his life after devastating defeat -- and his humanity: if he had to do it over again, he would never have chosen a military career ~Otherwise, his stoic, elegant persona served him well -- along with an ""ability to sacrifice"" -- inspiring loyalty from his ranks, and certainly veneration in the South for decades...",5,"""Marble Man""",1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,1200,"['Curious', 'dad', 'admiration', 'Lee', 'expressed', 'prize-winning', 'college', 'essay', 'almost', '1/2', 'century', 'ago', 'Southern', 'Gentleman', 'gallantry', 'surrendering', '@', 'Appomattox', 'devoured', 'DVD', 'New', 'Years', 'Eve', '~Blessedly', 'documentary', 'used', 'vintage', 'photography', 'expressive', 'drawings', 'paintings', 'letters', 'home', 'Arlington', 'reveal', 'enigmatic', 'man', 'thus', 'allowing', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'play', 'himself.I', 'had', 'idea', 'however', 'Lee', 'strategic', 'mastery', 'initially', 'demonstrated', 'Mexican', 'War', 'up', 'such', 'odds', 'Civil', 'War', 'where', 'had', 'ignored', 'massive', 'heart', 'attack', 'field', 'testimony', 'renowned', 'capacity', 'sacrifice', '.A', 'few', 'aides', 'saw', 'deep', 'sorrow', 'eyes', 'as', 'well', 'overlooking', 'carnage', 'Union', 'troops', 'had', 'done', 'army.The', 'film', 'stunning', 'quotation', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'exposing', 'ability', 'reflect', 'life', 'devastating', 'defeat', 'humanity', 'had', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'chosen', 'military', 'career', '~Otherwise', 'stoic', 'elegant', 'persona', 'served', 'well', 'ability', 'sacrifice', 'inspiring', 'loyalty', 'ranks', 'certainly', 'veneration', 'South', 'decades']",N/A
1388523,A29ZNOVQFNLIJD,B0047H7Q54,"Lyric ""natri""","[2, 8]","For years, Robert E. Lee has been lionized by Southerners who still haven't gotten over the Civil War.  The reviewers who didn't like this film rush to state that after the war, Lee ""calmed his former officers"" so that they wouldn't attempt to continue the war and he worked to help Southerners move forward.  Well, that's all nice Pollyannish-thinking but here is a bit of reality -- at the conclusion of the war, the US government would have been totally justified in arresting Lee and Davis and the rest of his cabinet and all of the Confederate generals and trying them for treason and hanging them.  It was only because there were wise heads in the US government who wanted the country to be re-united as the United States that this did not happen.  Lee took an oath when he went to West Point and when he became an Army officer that he would defend the United States.  For a man who was so interested in the concept of ""honor"" turning his back on that oath and resigning his commission so that he could become part of the rebel army that was leading the rebellion against the US government was a highly dishonorable act on his part.Would the same people posting on here be sympathetic to any American general today if he suddenly resigned his commission and decided to take up arms against the US government in Iraq or Afghanistan because he felt that what the US government was doing was wrong??  I think not.There is a strain of Southerner who will never get over the fact -- the shame -- that for all of their displays of ""patriotism"" via flagwaving and ""support our troops"" signs and their disproportionate numbers in the US military today -- that their region still bears the residual shame of having rebelled against the duly elected government of the United States on the pretext of wanting to protect states' rights when in actuality what they wanted to protect was their ability to own black human beings as slaves.Why do you think at the end of his life Lee stated that he wished he'd never joined the military?  It wasn't because he wasn't ""good"" at leading men in battle or because he wasn't brave and unfraid to face death -- it was the fact that he couldn't forgive himself for having compromised his honor and integrity by going back on his given word -- his oath -- and throwing his lot in with the people who wanted to perpetuate slavery.As to the poster who quoted from Lee's letter asking that the Confederate Army be allowed to admit black soldiers to their ranks -- please see that letter for what it really says.  Lee was desparate for more men, plus he wanted to deprive the Union Army of black troops.  The illogic of this letter lies in the fact that from a realistic standpoint what possible reason would a slave have had to fight for the South and the white Southern establishment that had kept them enslaved for decades?  Lee's letter was based on practicality and necessity -- he knew the South could not win -- the region had neither the manpower, the materiel, the money, etc that it would take to win the war.  His request to use black troops sprang not from any compassion for slaves or wanting to render them freemen, it was the result of a military commander accessing his situation and looking for a solution -- if only temporary.This film finally shows Lee warts and all.  Lee was always conscious of the fact that his father Lighthorse Harry Lee -- a hero of the Revolutionary War left his family impoverished by his actions later in life.  It's the reason that the Lee family lost their family home and the reason that Mary Custis' father looked askance at Lee when he was wooing her.  Ultimately, Lee himself left his family in worse condition than they'd been previously. Their home at Arlington was confiscated by the US government and turned into a cemetery so that if Lee ever returned there -- he would always have to look at what the war had cost -- thousands of dead on both sides.  I'm certain it weighed on him and certainly embittered him to see the beautiful Arlington turned into a place of perpetual death and mourning.Yes, Lee retired to Washington and Lee University and basically kept quiet for very good reasons -- he'd dishonored himself, he'd hurt his family, he'd betrayed his country, and he was lucky in the end to not hang for treasonous actions against the US government.  If Lee had taken a more courageous and difficult path -- one in which he'd refused to break his oath to defend the US government and if he had publicly declared the fact that he opposed the secession of his home state Virginia perhaps -- because he was a hero in Virginia -- he'd have kept Virginia in the Union and deprived the Southern states from the the most important state -- the one that the south needed because of Virginia's wealth, armament foundry, other industry, railroads, and ports.  That's the road he didn't take -- the one that ultimately may have prevented the war. No wonder he kept quiet.The bigotry and racism in this country today goes directly back to the Civil War and the fact that instead of the US government treating the South as the defeated mess that it was, the government allowed the southern states and their people to put their lives back together without being forced to drop the myths to which they cling and to abolish their silly racist-inspired need to fly their dispicable Confederate flag -- the flag of traitors.This video bio of Lee is the first one to show his character flaws and weaknesses that led him to make a decision that was disastrous for him personally and professionally.  If you want to see the Lee myth exposed, buy this film.",4,the end of hagiography,1314835200,"09 1, 2011",2011,5627,"['years', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Lee', 'been', 'lionized', 'Southerners', 'who', 'still',
