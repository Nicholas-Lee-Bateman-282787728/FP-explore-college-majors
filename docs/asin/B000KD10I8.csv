1033113,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B000KD10I8,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","Have you ever wanted to see a wacky sitcom based on &#34;Halo&#34;?I haven't. You probably haven't either.But we got one anyway. And in the machinima webseries &#34;Red Vs Blue - Season One - The Blood Gulch Chronicles,&#34; we're introduced to the bumbling space marines who fight for domination of a barren canyon that nobody really cares about, on an otherwise deserted planet. Pretty much nothing actually gets accomplished (except a few accidental deaths), but it's pretty hilarious nothingness -- and it lays the groundwork for the story arcs of seasons to come.In the future, there is some kind of vague civil war going on, and so the two sides have stationed troops at Blood Gulch Canyon -- one Blue station, and one Red station. Most of the time, the troops just hang around annoying each other. But in this case, the Red Team has just gotten a new jeep that Sarge (Matt Hullum) christens the &#34;Warthog,&#34; as well as a new rookie called Donut. The Blues are getting a tank.Then Donut gets confused, wanders into the Blue base and is accidentally given the flag -- which sparks off a bizarre battle between the two sides that ends up killing the de facto Blue leader Church. It's not a huge spoiler; he dies pretty early.Blue soldier Tucker calls for reinforcements, and they get the black-armored, foul-mouthed death machine Tex... who has an odd connection to the now-ghostly Church. The on-and-off conflict between them is further complicated by the discovery of a lifelike robot, a near-death experience (&#34;... you'd rub my neck with aloe vera?!&#34;), lightish red armor, a teleporter, and an AI that is influencing Tex from inside her armor.While later seasons became more plot-based, &#34;Red Vs Blue - Season One - The Blood Gulch Chronicles&#34; is gloriously plotless mayhem, with the occasional battle scene or wacky conflict. Most of the season falls under two basic categories:1. Characters running around causing massive damage to themselves and others.2. Characters hanging around having conversations completely unrelated to the war they're supposed to be fighting (&#34;Did the fact he never talks get to you?&#34; &#34;I just thought he was a silent guy.&#34; &#34;Not even that he drinks motor oil and sleeps standing up?&#34; &#34;I thought he was just trying to impress me&#34;).I can only assume that the Red and Blue groups were sent to this planet so that they wouldn't be a handicap to the more competent space marines, because these guys are hilariously awful. Some are idiots (Donut, Caboose), Sarge is somewhat insane (he believes pumas are mythical), Grif is lazy and Simmons has his lips firmly planted on Sarge's behind. The most competent one of the bunch is Church, who always seems to be on the verge of snapping -- even from beyond the grave. Or the not-grave, since his teammates are too dim to bury his body.But amidst all the chaos and wackiness (&#34;It's not pink! It's LIGHTISH RED!&#34;), there is a little thread of actual plot. Two characters die in remarkably tidy ways... well, three, but one of them is revived from the brink of death. And there is the whole matter of the mysterious AI that is influencing Tex -- it's not a huge part of the story, but it clearly is meant to be the beginning of an arc. And it's more serious than most of the goings-on.&#34;Red Vs Blue - Season One - The Blood Gulch Chronicles&#34; is a fun way to kick off this gloriously wacky little web-series, which proves that awkward CGI animation can't trump good writing.

Who knew that watching someone use men from the Halo games and get them into some pretty funny situations would be...well...funny!Picture a movie like Napoleon Dynamite.  Remember that that movie was really good even though it wasn't much of anything?  Well, that's a lot of what you get in Red vs Blue, mainly in season one, which is a really good season.  The series has changed so much since then, but this season is still excellent and a lot of fun to look back at.  So why do I give this season four stars instead of five?Well, while this season is a lot of fun, it has its moments that are laggy, and I don't like the language either, but there is actually a lot less language here than in other shows online, trust me.  This season, however, is still really good.  By the way, to any of you who say they would rather play Halo than watch this, I suppose I could understand that, but sometimes it's fun to see this type of stuff.Anyway, great season, and I can't wait for season 10!",4,Worthy to be called the best web series,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,1046,"['RvB', 'definitely', 'best', 'web', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'Who', 'knew', 'watching', 'someone', 'use', 'men', 'Halo', 'games', 'get', 'pretty', 'funny', 'situations', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'funny', 'Picture', 'movie', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', 'Remember', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'anything', 'Well', 'lot', 'what', 'get', 'Red', 'vs', 'Blue', 'mainly', 'season', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'season', 'series', 'changed', 'so', 'much', 'then', 'season', 'still', 'excellent', 'lot', 'fun', 'look', 'back', 'So', 'why', 'do', 'give', 'season', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'Well', 'season', 'lot', 'fun', 'moments', 'are', 'laggy', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'language', 'either', 'actually', 'lot', 'less', 'language', 'here', 'other', 'shows', 'online', 'trust', 'season', 'however', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'way', 'who', 'say', 'would', 'rather', 'play', 'Halo', 'watch', 'suppose', 'could', 'understand', 'fun', 'see', 'type', 'stuff.Anyway', 'great', 'season', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '10']",Red Vs Blue - Season One - The Blood Gulch Chronicles
1033116,A3E68QNSCABRVW,B000KD10I8,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[4, 5]","I first heard about this from a friend of mine in college.  Both being Halo fans he figured I would enjoy it immensely.  I have to say this is incredibly inventive!  It's almost an entirely new way to think of animation.  It's actually called ""machinima"".  This first started off as an internet craze and sure you can see episodes there, but to have it on DVD is just SO much better in my opinion.  It's definitely my preferred medium for watching anything.  I think most anyone into gaming will find some serious comedic factor in this, but I think it helps a lot more if you've ever done some multiplayer gaming.  Namely scenarios like death match or capture the flag.  Most people in my generation have some experience with a game called Counterstrike (based off of Half Life) and that's the one I used to play.  I didn't do much multiplayer gaming with Halo, but I think having that base knowledge in some form of multiplayer made Red vs. Blue all the more hilarious!This whole series is recorded ""in game"" on Halo!  One of the most, if not most popular, game released for the Xbox.  Basically this takes place on a multiplayer map called ""Blood Gulch"" and it's loaded with a capture the flag scenario.  Here we have the red team versus the blue team, as the title obviously states.  Now most people grasp this concept and expect a huge amount of battling and war to ensue.  This doesn't happen.  Instead this has a script and follows a very interesting notion that what if this was a major scale war!  This means you have large military backing to support this silly capture the flag scenario in a box canyon that you can only air lift people out of.  It also helps that both sides, for the most part, are completely inept!  It's a very silly show that will have people roaring in laughter.  It definitely helps if you have a very sarcastic and cynical sense of humor.  Also this whole thing isn't very ""innocent"" for there is a load of harsh language and very adult concepts.  Naturally we're talking teenager to college demographic for the most part.  Personally, I'll probably always find things like this funny.We actually have a very interesting array of characters on both teams.  However, this being volume one, I can tell they were still in the process of truly developing the characters.  Even some of the voices used change over the series as they refined points that made the characters funnier.  I've watched all five volumes by now and recently went to revisit this, Caboose's voice, for example, developed into something far sillier and made his character all the better in later episodes.  We see a quick shift between Sarge's episode one voice and quickly shifts to the more known Sarge voice in either episode two or three.  The only problem I really had with the voice overs is that at times it peaks (makes static) too much.  This especially happens whenever someone is yelling.  This is probably due more to the fact that they didn't exactly have top notch equipment at their fingertips for this first run.  Eventually as the seasons continue the quality gets way better, so if you were greatly troubled by this, it's really only on ""Volume 1"".  I've actually been wondering if it would be a good idea for them to go back and essentially re-dub ""Volume 1"" with the higher quality equipment and currently used voice tones.  Might be a good idea...Basically this show revolves around very random circumstances and the characters dealing with that generates all the humor.  Such as the blue side receives a tank no one is certified to drive.  They make general crack jokes related specifically to Halo that the fans will surely get and recognize.  Honestly I can't recommend this DVD enough.  It's by far one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  The only black mark, as I said, is the production quality on the voice over production.  If you're a fan of Halo and find nuances in multiplayer scenarios a riot, then this is definitely for you!Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5",5,One of the Funniest things I've Ever Seen!,1219449600,"08 23, 2008",2008,3994,"['first', 'heard', 'friend', 'mine', 'college', 'being', 'Halo', 'fans', 'figured', 'would', 'enjoy', 'immensely', 'have', 'say', 'incredibly', 'inventive', 'almost', 'entirely', 'new', 'way', 'think', 'animation', 'actually', 'called', 'machinima', 'first', 'started', 'off', 'internet', 'craze', 'sure', 'can', 'see', 'there', 'have', 'DVD', 'just', 'SO', 'much', 'better', 'opinion', 'definitely', 'preferred', 'medium', 'watching', 'anything', 'think', 'most', 'anyone', 'gaming', 'will', 'find', 'serious', 'comedic', 'factor', 'think', 'lot', 'more', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'done', 'multiplayer', 'gaming', 'Namely', 'scenarios', 'death', 'match', 'capture', 'flag', 'Most', 'people', 'generation', 'have', 'experience', 'game', 'called', 'Counterstrike', 'based', 'Half', 'Life', 'one', 'used', 'play', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'multiplayer', 'gaming', 'Halo', 'think', 'having', 'base', 'knowledge', 'form', 'multiplayer', 'made', 'Red', 'Blue', 'more', 'hilarious', 'whole', 'series', 'recorded', 'game', 'Halo', 'One', 'most', 'not', 'most', 'popular', 'game', 'released', 'Xbox', 'Basically', 'place', 'multiplayer', 'map', 'called', 'Blood', 'Gulch', 'loaded', 'capture', 'flag', 'scenario', 'Here', 'have', 'red', 'team', 'blue', 'team', 'title', 'obviously', 'Now', 'most', 'people', 'grasp', 'concept', 'expect', 'huge', 'amount', 'battling', 'war', 'ensue', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Instead', 'script', 'very', 'interesting', 'notion', 'what', 'was', 'major', 'scale', 'war', 'have', 'large', 'military', 'backing', 'support', 'silly', 'capture', 'flag', 'scenario', 'box', 'canyon', 'can', 'only', 'air', 'lift', 'people', 'also', 'sides', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'completely', 'inept', 'very', 'silly', 'show', 'will', 'have', 'people', 'roaring', 'laughter', 'definitely', 'have', 'very', 'sarcastic', 'cynical', 'sense', 'humor', 'Also', 'whole', 'thing', ""n't"", 'very', 'innocent', 'load', 'harsh', 'language', 'very', 'adult', 'concepts', 'Naturally', ""'re"", 'talking', 'teenager', 'college', 'demographic', 'most', 'part', 'Personally', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'always', 'find', 'things', 'funny.We', 'actually', 'have', 'very', 'interesting', 'array', 'characters', 'teams', 'However', 'being', 'volume', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'were', 'still', 'process', 'truly', 'developing', 'characters', 'Even', 'voices', 'used', 'change', 'series', 'refined', 'points', 'made', 'characters', 'funnier', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'five', 'volumes', 'now', 'recently', 'went', 'revisit', 'Caboose', 'voice', 'example', 'developed', 'something', 'far', 'sillier', 'made', 'character', 'better', 'later', 'episodes', 'see', 'quick', 'shift', 'Sarge', 'episode', 'one', 'voice', 'quickly', 'shifts', 'more', 'known', 'Sarge', 'voice', 'episode', 'two', 'three', 'only', 'problem', 'really', 'had', 'voice', 'overs', 'times', 'static', 'too', 'much', 'especially', 'whenever', 'someone', 'yelling', 'probably', 'due', 'more', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'have', 'top', 'notch', 'equipment', 'fingertips', 'first', 'run', 'Eventually', 'seasons', 'continue', 'quality', 'way', 'better', 'so', 'were', 'greatly', 'troubled', 'really', 'only', 'Volume', '1', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'been', 'wondering', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'go', 'back', 'essentially', 're-dub', 'Volume', '1', 'higher', 'quality', 'equipment', 'currently', 'used', 'voice', 'tones', 'Might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'Basically', 'show', 'around', 'very', 'random', 'circumstances', 'characters', 'dealing', 'humor', 'Such', 'blue', 'side', 'tank', 'one', 'certified', 'drive', 'make', 'general', 'crack', 'jokes', 'related', 'specifically', 'Halo', 'fans', 'will', 'surely', 'get', 'recognize', 'Honestly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'DVD', 'enough', 'far', 'one', 'funniest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'only', 'black', 'mark', 'said', 'production', 'quality', 'voice', 'production', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Halo', 'find', 'nuances', 'multiplayer', 'scenarios', 'riot', 'then', 'definitely', 'Overall', 'Rating', '4.5', '5']",Red Vs Blue - Season One - The Blood Gulch Chronicles
