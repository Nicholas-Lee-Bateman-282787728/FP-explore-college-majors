While I felt the episodes were somewhat uneven in writing and plot as is the case with most TV shows this is a great SciFi show. It gives you a more in depth look at the rogue Captain Jack and the rest of the Torchwood team. I was hooked on Torchwood after watching one episode of MD the 4th season. While the concept was interesting in the 4th season the first 3 seasons are a step above. It would be nice if American Sci Fi would reach the level of Torchwood.,5,If you like Dr. Who you may love this!

1436022,A3ORWAR4CAOPAC,B0050UEVFU,DRob,"[15, 17]","Somehow we missed the second season of Torchwood when it finally was shown on American TV. We watched the first season and found it okay, and then were riveted by Children of Earth. But now having seen all three seasons of the BBC show (yes, I know there were 4 seasons but the 4th season was an American production), I can say we have a new appreciation for the show.After watching the first season on TV, we weren't horribly impressed. None of the characters seemed particularly likable, not even the absolutely delicious John Barrowman as Captain Jack. The character of Gwen Cooper, played by the stunningly beautiful Eve Myles, who is supposed to be a sympathetic character, is cheating on her devoted boyfriend, Rhys, with the crotchety and just plain nasty Owen Harper. Ianto, who could be likable, is so busy pining for his girlfriend turned Cyberman that he abandons all of his normal good sense and quiet capability, and Toshiko could easily become one of the original ""Mean Girls."" Rather than working together as a team to try to catch the aliens who constantly pop into Cardiff due to the interspatial rift upon which the city is situated, the Torchwood group snipes at each other and careens from one incursion after another, often causing more problems than they solve.The second season, however, brings them together as a team, working together to resolve the alien situations. The first episode of the second season shows them slogging along without Captain Jack, who has disappeared. Gwen Cooper is leading the team and seems to have resolved her problems with Rhys because she has accepted his marriage proposal. Tosh is no longer the little snitch, dripping with jealousy if anyone so much as talks to Owen, and Owen, himself, has become likable. He is still cynical and caustic, but has lost the nastiness he displayed in the first season. Ianto is steadier and more of a full member of the team, and when Jack finally makes his appearance, he finds that the group has moved beyond him. They are no longer willing to do whatever he says; they have become quite capable of making their own decisions, which don't always align with his.The writing for the second season is very powerful, and just about every episode left me in tears. Particularly moving was the episode involving the World War I soldier who is brought out of cryogenic storage one day a year to see if it is time for him to play his extremely important, but completely mysterious role in saving the universe. Also moving was the episode in which Owen finally comes to terms with being dead, even though he is still able to walk and talk. While I found Freema Agyemang's Martha Jones character annoying on Doctor Who, she was a very welcome recurring character in this season of Torchwood.In addition, the episode in which Gwen wakes up on the morning of her wedding only to find herself extremely pregnant with an alien's baby was very, very funny. The final two episodes of Season Two, in which they explore the back stories of how each of the characters came to Torchwood, were very, very moving and sad-- and ranked right up there in terms of quality with some of the very good Doctor Who episodes.One of the things that is always especially fascinating about Torchwood is, of course, the character of Captain Jack, without whom there could be no Torchwood. Himself an alien, he often looks at things from a different moral standpoint than the humans who surround him. The first season episode in which he, without protest, allows a child to join the fairy-like aliens who have so viciously attacked her family and the people who have tried to protect her, is but one example of the different way in which he looks at things. The episode in which the airplane passengers arrive from the past is another example, as it is very difficult to imagine any of the human members of Torchwood assisting the older man in his suicide as does TJack. There are times when his character is so completely alien as to be totally incomprehensible, and other times when you can see that he, at times, understands humans more than we understand ourselves-- and to drop into philosophical mode for a moment, that is probably the most interesting thing about Torchwood, in that it explores the foibles of humanity in a way that Doctor Who has never been able to do.I am very glad we decided to give this series another try, as the second season alone has made it very worthwhile. The third season, Children of Earth, is also an incredibly strong storyline, compelling, outrageous, and ultimately another unbearably sad ending. I hope that Torchwood will return again, preferably on the BBC but if we have to accept the American version, so be it.",5,Wow...

1436023,A39C2BQXZHOUMJ,B0050UEVFU,G. Dowling,"[1, 2]","""Torchwood"" is a rolicking British series about a group of agents who work for an underground agency called Torchwood. It's a spin-off of the beloved ""Dr. Who"" series, with Captain Jack Harkness(the superb John Barrowman) leading the charge. We learn that Captain Jack heads up Torchwood 3 (i.e. Torchwood: Cardiff). We learn that Torchwood 1 (London) was destroyed by the Cybermen in a Doctor Who episode in a battle known in the series mythology as The Battle of Canary Wharf. This episode has homage paid two it in the series' 3rd episode, ""Cyberwoman.""""Torchwood"" is a kind of adult version of the X-Files, as the show is very violent and very sexual. Captain Jack is bisexual (or omnisexual as he puts it). He is also immortal for reasons explained over the course of the series due to events on ""Dr. Who."". This subplot drives some of the more interesting scenes. The team is filled out with wonderful actors and characters. Burn Gorman is winning as Dr. Owen Harper, Eve Myles is brilliant as former police officer Gwen Cooper. We see her recruitment to Torchwood in the first couple of episodes. Naoko Mori (Ab Fab) is incredibly likable as computer genius and mathematician, Toshiko ""Tosh"" Sato. Rounding out the group is Gareth David-Lloyd as Ianto Jones, the group's office manager who is promoted as the show proceeds.This winning cast makes Torchwood a cut above the usual sci-fi fare. The stories are truly original, the dialogue is sharp, funny, and sometimes very moving. The first two shows play like any serial...1 hr. episodes as the group deals with things such as a sex-addicted alien, evil fairies, cyberwomen, and many other imaginative foes. The characters are so sincerely likable that we root for them even when they behave badly, which they do. Seasons 3 and 4 are miniseries style. ""Children of Earth"" being about an alien visiting Earth demanding that we give over ten percent of the child population. It is much darker than the season which preceded it, and there is some division among fans regarding this series.  It is the scariest sci-fi story I have ever seen.  It seems to be the dark and scary tone which put off fans.  There are moments which are truly stomach turning emotionally.  ""Miracle Day""(sold separately) is a truly original idea, where humans stop dying one day for some unknown reason and its about the impact on the workld. Torchwood springs back into action with some familiar faces and a largely new team.This bluray package includes the first three seasons of the show. It must be said they look and sound incredible in HD. It was like seeing them anew, as the picture boasts incredible colors, fine detail, the soundtrack (DTS-HD 5.1) is awesome, fans have never heard the show sound this good. The package itself was a surprisingly strudy, hard cardboad and the discs are inserted in the pages which includes production stills. The special features are very cool. Fans will ""geek"" out for them. ""Children of Earth"" is a little light on features(although it contains a Torchwood Declassified documentary which is surprisingly comprehensive) but this is forgivable given how terrific the discs look and sound. The $90-100 price tag may seem a little stiff, but the discs would cost you almost twice as much to buy them separately and the quality of the set justifies the pricetag. I would highly recommend this set. Its a must own for fans, but newcomers will greatly enjoy the Torchwood universe and will likely be drooling for more.",5,"""Outside the government, beyond the police...the 21st century is when everything changes, and Torchwood is ready!""",1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,3487,"['Torchwood', 'rolicking', 'British', 'series', 'group', 'agents', 'who', 'work', 'underground', 'agency', 'called', 'Torchwood', 'spin-off', 'beloved', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'series', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'Harkness', 'superb', 'John', 'Barrowman', 'leading', 'charge', 'learn', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'up', 'Torchwood', '3', 'i.e', 'Torchwood', 'Cardiff', 'learn', 'Torchwood', '1', 'London', 'was', 'destroyed', 'Cybermen', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'episode', 'battle', 'known', 'series', 'mythology', 'Battle', 'Canary', 'Wharf', 'episode', 'homage', 'paid', 'two', 'series', '3rd', 'episode', 'Cyberwoman', 'Torchwood', 'kind', 'adult', 'version', 'X-Files', 'show', 'very', 'violent', 'very', 'sexual', 'Captain', 'Jack', 'bisexual', 'omnisexual', 'also', 'immortal', 'reasons', 'explained', 'course', 'series', 'due', 'events', 'Dr', 'Who.', 'subplot', 'more', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'team', 'filled', 'out', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'characters', 'Burn', 'Gorman', 'winning', 'Dr.', 'Owen', 'Harper', 'Eve', 'Myles', 'brilliant', 'former', 'police', 'officer', 'Gwen', 'Cooper', 'see', 'recruitment', 'Torchwood', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Naoko', 'Mori', 'Ab', 'Fab', 'incredibly', 'likable', 'computer', 'genius', 'mathematician', 'Toshiko', 'Tosh', 'Sato', 'Rounding', 'out', 'group', 'Gareth', 'David-Lloyd', 'Ianto', 'Jones', 'group', 'office', 'manager', 'who', 'promoted', 'show', 'winning', 'cast', 'Torchwood', 'cut', 'usual', 'sci-fi', 'fare', 'stories', 'are', 'truly', 'original', 'dialogue', 'sharp', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'very', 'moving', 'first', 'two', 'shows', 'play', 'serial', '1', 'hr', 'group', 'things', 'such', 'sex-addicted', 'alien', 'evil', 'fairies', 'cyberwomen', 'many', 'other', 'imaginative', 'foes', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'sincerely', 'likable', 'root', 'even', 'when', 'behave', 'badly', 'do', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'are', 'miniseries', 'style', 'Children', 'Earth', 'being', 'alien', 'visiting', 'Earth', 'demanding', 'give', 'over', 'ten', 'percent', 'child', 'population', 'much', 'darker', 'season', 'preceded', 'division', 'fans', 'regarding', 'series', 'scariest', 'sci-fi', 'story', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'be', 'dark', 'scary', 'tone', 'put', 'off', 'fans', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'truly', 'stomach', 'turning', 'emotionally', 'Miracle', 'Day', 'sold', 'separately', 'truly', 'original', 'idea', 'where', 'humans', 'stop', 'dying', 'one', 'day', 'unknown', 'reason', 'impact', 'workld', 'Torchwood', 'back', 'action', 'familiar', 'largely', 'new', 'team.This', 'bluray', 'package', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'show', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'look', 'sound', 'incredible', 'HD', 'was', 'seeing', 'anew', 'picture', 'incredible', 'colors', 'fine', 'detail', 'soundtrack', 'DTS-HD', '5.1', 'awesome', 'fans', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'show', 'sound', 'good', 'package', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'strudy', 'hard', 'cardboad', 'discs', 'are', 'inserted', 'pages', 'production', 'stills', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'very', 'cool', 'Fans', 'will', 'geek', 'out', 'Children', 'Earth', 'little', 'light', 'features', 'Torchwood', 'Declassified', 'documentary', 'surprisingly', 'comprehensive', 'forgivable', 'given', 'how', 'terrific', 'discs', 'look', 'sound', '90-100', 'price', 'tag', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'stiff', 'discs', 'would', 'cost', 'almost', 'twice', 'as', 'much', 'buy', 'separately', 'quality', 'set', 'pricetag', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'must', 'own', 'fans', 'newcomers', 'will', 'greatly', 'enjoy', 'Torchwood', 'universe', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'drooling', 'more']",Torchwood: The Complete Original UK Series

I loaned a friend of mine the set and he encountered the same problems while playing the set on his DVD player.The actors in this show are truly wonderful. The women are talented and beautiful, and the male stars are very accomplished actors. One can tell that the sets for the Torchwood headquarters must have cost a fortune. It is well lit, really cool to look at, and it has just enough clutter to make it interesting.The only part of the episodes I do not appreciate are the ones in which Captain Jack lip-locks other men.

That out of the way, the characters are generally appealing, though somewhat un-even at times; (this, positively, is due to the most realistic part of the series---that human beings are inconsistent---in their opinions, in their desires and in their choices).My favorites are Captain Jack Harkness (who the show was built around after his 'preview' in DOCTOR WHO) and Gwen. Owen began as an annoying irritant, but over time could begin to grow on the audience as rationals, derived from his background and experiences, were developed to explain his general cynicism and acidity. Toshiko and Ianto, as characters, took much longer to develop. They had less to do and we knew little about them. As the story-lines develop, we find that they are, in fact, mirror images of one another, both filled with doubts and insecurities despite their talents and contributions to the Torchwood Team.

1436038,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0050UEVFU,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[0, 0]","&#34;Torchwood&#34; (an anagram for &#34;Doctor Who&#34;) arrived courtesy of Russell T. Davies as a spin-off for the popular character of Captain Jack Harkness (a character introduced during the first season with the ninth Doctor). The first three seasons of the series appear here (athe fourth is not included as it was produced by Starz network in collaboration with the BBC and took place in the United States and United Kingdom).I should warn you that if you haven't seen the show and are thinking about purchasing it that, if you are offended by characters that are homo or bisexual characters, activity, you won't enjoy the show as the main character of Harkness swings both ways. Some of the early episodes also have strong sexual themes (which led me to christen it &#34;The seX-Files&#34; during season one) although there are plenty of strong episodes that don't focus on that element. I mention all of this just in case it is offensive to you.The first three seasons set up the premise--Torchwood was established by the British to deal with alien incursions as a result of the Doctor's interaction with and invasion of alien species on Earth. Captain Harkness is from the 34th century and leads the Torchwood team in the 21st century.His team consists of Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), Owen Wilson (Burn Gorman), Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd) and Tosh Sato (Naoko Mori) who are monitoring a rift in time and space in Cardiff caused by the Doctor's Tardis. Unfortunately the rift allows various aliens and alien technology to leak through to our time resulting in often disasterous results.The first season of the series is a bit inconsistent and is more episodic than later seasons. The second season is more consistent than the first although there was a change in some members of the cast. Each of the first two seasons are 13 episodes each while the third season was much shorter due to a network change and budget cuts but is equally stellar with an overall story arc dominating the season for its five episodes.The third season takes quite a departure focusing on a season long story arc involving aliens and a conspiracy involving abducted children. It reminded me more of a Quatermass series but still fit the characters from Torchwood very well.The fourth season which (SPOILERS)focuses on Harkness immortality and a story where everyone in the world becomes immortal while Harkness becomes mortal is the best of the series IMHO although many fans of the series are split between loving the first two seasons or the last (I like both).(END OF SPOILERS)Image quality is extremely good although the first and second seasons on Blu-ray are presented in 1080i instead of 1080p (identical to the original single season releases).The third season subtitled &#34;Children of Earth&#34; is also presented in 1080i. As a result all three seasons might look just a tad bit softer than a 1080p presentation. That isn't to suggest they don't look exceptionally good--they do although I did find that the overuse of digital noise reduction to be a bit much on the first season compared to later ones for those who pay attention to such things. Detail for the entire series is still strong. Blacks are rock solid as well.Audio sounds terrific with a nice, strong 5.1 mix for the show and English subtitles for the series.This boxed set just consolidates the first three seasons in one place without any new extras that are notable. We do get a number of commentary tracks on the first season (for each episode) which are, sadly, missing from the second season. We do get deleted scenes as well as &#34;Torchwood Declassified&#34; for each episode. We also get an outtake reel for the first and second season.The third season is, unfortunately, the lightest when it comes to special features. We only get a half hour featurette on the production of the show.The packaging is kind of neat but also a pain at the same time. The series is presented in a book with each disc sliding out of the cardboard pages. While Blu-rays are resistent to scratches, I do get concerned about the wear and tear on them and do wish the series had come in a conventional blu-ray case. The book is housed in a larger than normal (for a blu-ray case) sturdy cardboard case.If you're looking to get the series all in one place (except for season four), this is a very good bargain although be aware of the packaging issue I mentioned and the fact that none of the video has been remastered in 1080p. These minor issues aside, this is a very good show that found its footing with the second season and managed to expand on its premise during the third and fourth seasons very effectively.Recommended.",4,"The first three seasons presented in 1080i, same extras as before",1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,4678,"['34', 'Torchwood', '34', 'anagram', '34', 'Doctor', 'Who', '34',
