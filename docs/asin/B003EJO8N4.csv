I forgave the killing of Elizabeth as I thought Uncle Malcolm was fantastic - but this series has many storylines that were not in LM Montgomery's original novels and that taint the fantastic trilogy.I think my biggest problem is the dealing of Perry (one of my favourite characters) and the very adult themes in this series - it is no longer the family friendly series it began as. Also I didn't like that there was no firm conclusion to wrap things up the way it should have been.Watch it if you have followed the series - but be warned it is not in the spirit of Montgomery.",3,Too far removed from the original story,1303430400,"04 22, 2011",2011,694,"['Hmm', 'series', 'started', 'out', 'strongly', 'sadly', 'went', 'little', 'off', 'rails', 'final', 'season', 'particular', 'forgave', 'killing', 'Elizabeth', 'thought', 'Uncle', 'Malcolm', 'was', 'fantastic', 'series', 'many', 'storylines', 'were', 'not', 'LM', 'Montgomery', 'original', 'novels', 'taint', 'fantastic', 'trilogy.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'dealing', 'Perry', 'one', 'favourite', 'characters', 'very', 'adult', 'themes', 'series', 'no', 'longer', 'family', 'friendly', 'series', 'began', 'Also', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'firm', 'conclusion', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'way', 'should', 'have', 'been.Watch', 'have', 'followed', 'series', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'spirit', 'Montgomery']",N/A

And if you believe EMILY OF NEW MOON would be good because of the author Montgomery then you will be disappointed. This is not the Montgomery you would have expected after reading the books.  This series is not from the hands that brought us ANNE OF GREEN GABLES and ROAD TO AVONLEA!  This is from somebody called Marlene Mathews.  This series loves to engage in the paranormal; Emily always see dead people in all but one episode.,1,Ghost Stories,1279324800,"07 17, 2010",2010,460,"['do', ""n't"", 'like', 'ghost', 'stories', 'believe', 'EMILY', 'OF', 'NEW', 'MOON', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'author', 'Montgomery', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'not', 'Montgomery', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'reading', 'books', 'series', 'not', 'hands', 'brought', 'ANNE', 'OF', 'GREEN', 'GABLES', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'AVONLEA', 'somebody', 'called', 'Marlene', 'Mathews', 'series', 'engage', 'paranormal', 'Emily', 'always', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'one', 'episode']",N/A
