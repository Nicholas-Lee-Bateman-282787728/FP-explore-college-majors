1105704,A3NGLC82R4S4O,B000VZADPQ,C.S.,"[10, 30]","In my opinion, season seven is proof that Will & Grace ran two seasons too long. Unfortunately, a once-witty and original sitcom suddenly relied on flashy guest stars every week, such as Janet Jackson, to full the void left by lack-luster scripts. The guest stars in past seasons were used to complement interesting and funny storylines, however, in season seven, the show depended too heavily on guest stars to draw in viewers to watch dull episodes.Honestly, I could not sit through most of the episodes so perhaps I'm missing the mark because I changed the channel too soon into the shows. I'm still giving the DVD 3 stars because I LOVE the cast, especially the hilarious Megan Mullally!!!The promised ""Loaded with extra features"" will most likely once again be a lie as previous DVD's have demonstrated. ""Themed featurettes"" with clips of the season's shows set to music are not EXTRA features...

1105715,AAP2RANG3TTSM,B000VZADPQ,"Rodney Bogardus ""piscean dream""","[30, 33]","Ladies and gentlemen, we finally have a genuinely complete season of our beloved WILL & GRACE on DVD! After buying the DVDs for seasons 3-6 only to find that nearly all of the ""super size"" episodes and many of the hour-long episodes were the syndicated versions on the DVD, NBC seems to have gotten their act together and put together a long-overdue quality DVD release with season 7. The ""super size"" season premier, ""FYI: I Hurt, Too"" and the hour-long ""Queens For a Day"" are both fully intact with no scenes cut and are presented in their complete original broadcast versions.As for the season itself, I'm in the minority of W&G; fans by really liking this season. Many fans claim that season 7 is their least favorite, but I think of it as the recovery season, or the comeback season, if you will. Like another reviewer said, this season the show returned to the basics, which is all the show ever needed, if you ask me. I think the show's genuine problems were found in seasons 5 and 6: Grace married Leo, Karen dated and subsequently married Lyle, and Debra Messing's absence throughout season 6 due to her pregnancy definitely took its toll on the overall quality and dynamics of the show. Seasons 5 and 6 certainly had great episodes, but they also had their share of duds which precipitated the show's decline in ratings and quality.What works about season 7 is that it is complex, proportionately mixed with comedy and drama: Grace getting over her failed marriage to Leo and Karen getting over her husband's death and her failed brief marriage to Lyle, all underlying the comedic situations that Will, Grace, Jack, and Karen usually find themselves in. I especially like how no time is wasted stringing Leo along-- he disappears after the first episode! Near the end of the season premier Grace appears at Will's door with an overnight bag and says, ""I just couldn't. It's over."" It's a heart-wrenching scene that lasts about 30 seconds, but it's one of the most real and touching scenes in the entire series. Grace's marriage was over and she relied on Will, her best friend, to catch her fall.What doesn't work about season 7 is the gratuitous celebrity guest stars. I don't begrudge the show for this, rather it's the fault of the network for forcing the show to accommodate guest stars. Lily Tomlin, Sharon Stone, Jeff Goldblum, and Molly Shannon were great (""Partners"" with Lily Tomlin is one of my favorite episodes of the season and series), but there was no need for another appearance by Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson's appearance was beyond ridiculous and unnecessary, and the part of Vince's best friend ""Nadine"" could have been a much more unique and interesting character had Kristen Davis not been cast in the role, who landed the part solely on the basis of her recent SEX AND THE CITY fame.Considering the quality of the DVD release and the season itself, I think it deserves 5 stars, simply for fact that there are no edited episodes to be found. Despite the fact that there are very few extras, I can enjoy this season, in its entirety on DVD, for what it was. Season 7 wasn't the show's greatest season, but it rectified the problems presented in previous seasons and set the show up for its superb final season.",5,COMPLETE and UNCUT episodes... finally!,1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,3242,"['Ladies', 'gentlemen', 'finally', 'have', 'genuinely', 'complete', 'season', 'beloved', 'WILL', 'GRACE', 'DVD', 'buying', 'DVDs', 'seasons', '3-6', 'only', 'find', 'nearly', 'super', 'size', 'episodes', 'many', 'hour-long', 'episodes', 'were', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'DVD', 'NBC', 'have', 'gotten', 'act', 'together', 'put', 'together', 'long-overdue', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'season', '7', 'super', 'size', 'season', 'premier', 'FYI', 'Hurt', 'Too', 'hour-long', 'Queens', 'Day', 'are', 'fully', 'intact', 'scenes', 'cut', 'are', 'presented', 'complete', 'original', 'broadcast', 'versions.As', 'season', ""'m"", 'minority', 'W', 'G', 'fans', 'really', 'liking', 'season', 'Many', 'fans', 'claim', 'season', '7', 'least', 'favorite', 'think', 'recovery', 'season', 'comeback', 'season', 'will', 'reviewer', 'said', 'season', 'show', 'returned', 'basics', 'show', 'ever', 'needed', 'ask', 'think', 'show', 'genuine', 'problems', 'were', 'found', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'Grace', 'married', 'Leo', 'Karen', 'dated', 'subsequently', 'married', 'Lyle', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'absence', 'season', '6', 'due', 'pregnancy', 'definitely', 'took', 'toll', 'overall', 'quality', 'dynamics', 'show', 'Seasons', '5', '6', 'certainly', 'had', 'great', 'episodes', 'also', 'had', 'share', 'duds', 'precipitated', 'show', 'decline', 'ratings', 'quality.What', 'season', '7', 'complex', 'proportionately', 'mixed', 'comedy', 'drama', 'Grace', 'getting', 'failed', 'marriage', 'Leo', 'Karen', 'getting', 'husband', 'death', 'failed', 'brief', 'marriage', 'Lyle', 'underlying', 'comedic', 'situations', 'Will', 'Grace', 'Jack', 'Karen', 'usually', 'find', 'especially', 'how', 'time', 'wasted', 'stringing', 'Leo', 'along', 'first', 'episode', 'end', 'season', 'premier', 'Grace', 'Will', 'door', 'overnight', 'bag', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'over', 'heart-wrenching', 'scene', '30', 'seconds', 'one', 'most', 'real', 'touching', 'scenes', 'entire', 'series', 'Grace', 'marriage', 'was', 'relied', 'Will', 'best', 'friend', 'catch', 'fall.What', ""n't"", 'work', 'about', 'season', '7', 'gratuitous', 'celebrity', 'guest', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'begrudge', 'show', 'rather', 'fault', 'network', 'forcing', 'show', 'accommodate', 'guest', 'stars', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Molly', 'Shannon', 'were', 'great', 'Partners', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'season', 'series', 'was', 'need', 'appearance', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Janet', 'Jackson', 'appearance', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'unnecessary', 'part', 'Vince', 'best', 'friend', 'Nadine', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'unique', 'interesting', 'character', 'had', 'Kristen', 'Davis', 'not', 'been', 'cast', 'role', 'who', 'landed', 'part', 'solely', 'basis', 'recent', 'SEX', 'THE', 'CITY', 'fame.Considering', 'quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'season', 'think', '5', 'stars', 'simply', 'fact', 'are', 'edited', 'episodes', 'be', 'found', 'fact', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'extras', 'can', 'enjoy', 'season', 'entirety', 'DVD', 'what', 'was', 'Season', '7', 'was', ""n't"", 'show', 'greatest', 'season', 'rectified', 'problems', 'presented', 'previous', 'seasons', 'set', 'show', 'up', 'superb', 'final', 'season']",Will & Grace: Season 7

Did people notice that Friends was not so funny after its 6th season?  And that in its 10th season, it was really just scraping the bottom of the barrel?  W&G;, in its 7th season, may have lost some of its ""HO-MOJO"", but altogether, still pulled off some great writing.The show peaks from seasons 1 to 6, but bounces back with an even stronger 8th season, which, I am hoping gets released soon.I have never watched a television show more times.  The cast is unbelievably talented and they all seem to have grown more naturally and maturely towards portraying their characters as the show progressed.  None of them ever ""acted"".It is arguable that most of the time, Jack and Karen were the ones that were funniest, but without the balance and sanity that Will & Grace  provided, the whole thing would have been a vain and ludicrous showcase of a flamboyantly gay satire.As a gay man, I find this show doubly appealing.  Not only is it hugely entertaining, but it also conveys several positive messages: that Homosexuals a)can be successful and productive members of society; b)are just like everybody else in that they value friendships and relationships; c)are people too and that they should NOT BE TOLERATED but EMBRACED; d)are truly members of the superior race because they enjoy the best of both worlds, are hilarious and great to live with, and, have impeccable taste!!!Finally, one of the most touching scenes (season 8/A Little Christmas Queer) was when Will asked his mother why she cheered on her 9 yr. old gay nephew's christmas show while she ruined every one of his productions when he was a child by being so uncomfortable and unsupportive.  She replied, ""because back then, I didn't know the kind of person you would turn out to be.""Will & Grace will always be remembered as a show that mattered and broke ground because not only did it make us laugh and cry with delight, but it also made us think about how we are all wonderfully unique, and how, at the same time, we are also still one and the same: HUMAN.",4,Excuuuse Me!
