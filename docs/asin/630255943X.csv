That is funny. He goes on to do bigger and better movies while his co-stars, Sean Astin and Pauly Shore, see their careers perish in Hollywood purgatory. It's apparent why these two were unlikable back then because the former is pretty much a jerk while the latter sucks at whatever he says, does, moves, behaves, dresses, or thinks. Back to the film, there is a lot of holes in the plot about how the two boys find the caveman and how he acts afterwards. There is no way that a chuck of block within 10 feet from the ground would stay unmelted. After being stuck in the block of ice for, oh I don't know, 100,000 years, it's not possible for Link to be able to walk anymore. Ask anyone who has been out of a 10 year coma. Or better yet, watch Hard to Kill with Steven Seagal. It is not possible for that hole for a pool is able to hold any gallon of water, let alone 1,000 of it.

To balance this we must also find someone to portray the serious scholar that observes and guides him through the intricacies of today's environment from driving to the Seven-Eleven; that person can only be Pauly Shore.

The caveman thaws, and Dave and Stoney turn him into a buff California high school student -- who, as far as anyone knows, is Linkavich (Link, short for Missing Link), an exchange student from Estonia.  The plan, as Dave sees it, is to use their caveman to pick up chicks -- especially Robin, the girl of his dreams.  But it all backfires when the girls start falling for Link instead...Okay, I'll admit that this movie is unrealistic and totally ridiculous.  But that's exactly why I love it.  After watching it again -- for the first time in years -- I still laughed so hard that I almost fell off my chair.  And I was reminded that many of the silly quotes that I still recite repeatedly originally came from this movie (and, believe me, there are plenty of great lines to choose from).

320166,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,630255943X,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[0, 0]","Encino Man is one of those aged movies that never really hit it big and has long since been forgotten but I've had very fond memories of it so I was terrified it would lose its appeal after so many years. Fortunately for me, my nostalgia was well founded. This movie was one a childhood favourite and I'm happy to report that, even after 20+  years, it still doesn't disappoint. And the more I think about it, I never truly appreciated its cult-like status as much as I do now.While on the surface, Encino Man is unrevolutionary in that it's everything you'd expect from a 90's-era Pauly Shore film. But if you look a little deeper you'll unearth a keen satire about popularity in high school. I mean, c'mon. The idea that a Cro-Magnon Man could become the coolest kid in school is pretty funny, probably because it's almost believable. And of course there will always be the naysayers who throw the plot's plausibility to the wind, but to them I say, ""SHOOSH!""Am I saying this movie remotely accurate? Not at all. But do I care? No way!Though the initial premise is every bit as silly as it sounds, there's also an unexpected sweetness that makes it surprisingly deep. One wouldn't expect a cave man to be deep, but he is. He manages to teach modern day man humility, compassion and the true meaning of friendship. And boiled down, that's really what this movie is all about. Sure, it comes across as dated but I really don't think that detracted at all from the entertainment value. In fact, it actually served to enhance the movie's rad quality. Yeah, there might be a few overtly 90's cliches but they're altogether spot on and fun.Another thing that I really appreciated about Encino Man was the wholesomeness of the comedy and the chemistry between the cast. Pre-hobbit Sean Astin and pro-goofball Pauly Shore make quite the dynamic duo and play off one another well. Their friendship in the movie is reminiscent of a Bill and Ted or a Wayne and Garth. &#65279;&#65279;Astin does serious like Shore does zany and it just works. And then there's the spectacular debut of Brendan Fraiser as the Cro-Magnon Man, Link. He's limber and animalistic and funny and simple and understanding and probably the most human person in the entire film. You seriously can't take your eyes off him. Frasier, without a doubt, is the heart and soul of Encino Man. So yeah, the film might not be anything super revolutionary but it sure is a whole lotta fun. And really, isn't that all anyone can ask for?Food for Thought: Encino Man is a simple 90's film with a lot of era-specific spirit. While you won't necessarily find anything revolutionary here, you will find spunk and humour and heart. This movie has lesser known a cult-following and is sure to please fans of Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and Wayne's World. It was always a childhood favourite of mine and still is, even after two decades. At the very least, it'll be a good guilty pleasure film.",5,A childhood favourite that still does not disappoint!,1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,2945,"['Encino', 'Man', 'one', 'aged', 'movies', 'never', 'really', 'hit', 'big', 'long', 'been', 'forgotten', ""'ve"", 'had', 'very', 'fond', 'memories', 'was', 'terrified', 'would', 'lose', 'appeal', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'Fortunately', 'nostalgia', 'was', 'well', 'founded', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'childhood', 'favourite', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'even', '20+', 'years', 'still', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'more', 'think', 'never', 'truly', 'appreciated', 'cult-like', 'status', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'now.While', 'surface', 'Encino', 'Man', 'unrevolutionary', 'everything', ""'d"", 'expect', ""90's-era"", 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'film', 'look', 'little', 'deeper', ""'ll"", 'unearth', 'keen', 'satire', 'popularity', 'high', 'school', 'mean', ""c'mon"", 'idea', 'Cro-Magnon', 'Man', 'could', 'become', 'coolest', 'kid', 'school', 'pretty', 'funny', 'probably', 'almost', 'believable', 'course', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'naysayers', 'who', 'throw', 'plot', 'plausibility', 'wind', 'say', 'SHOOSH', 'Am', 'saying', 'movie', 'remotely', 'accurate', 'Not', 'do', 'care', 'way', 'initial', 'premise', 'bit', 'as', 'silly', 'also', 'unexpected', 'sweetness', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'One', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'cave', 'man', 'be', 'deep', 'teach', 'modern', 'day', 'man', 'humility', 'compassion', 'true', 'meaning', 'friendship', 'boiled', 'down', 'really', 'what', 'movie', 'Sure', 'dated', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'detracted', 'entertainment', 'value', 'fact', 'actually', 'served', 'enhance', 'movie', 'rad', 'quality', 'Yeah', 'might', 'be', 'few', 'overtly', '90', 'cliches', ""'re"", 'altogether', 'spot', 'fun.Another', 'thing', 'really', 'appreciated', 'Encino', 'Man', 'was', 'wholesomeness', 'comedy', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'Pre-hobbit', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'pro-goofball', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'make', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'well', 'friendship', 'movie', 'reminiscent', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'Wayne', 'Garth', '65279', '65279', 'Astin', 'serious', 'Shore', 'zany', 'just', 'then', 'spectacular', 'debut', 'Brendan', 'Fraiser', 'Cro-Magnon', 'Man', 'Link', 'limber', 'animalistic', 'funny', 'simple', 'understanding', 'probably', 'most', 'human', 'person', 'entire', 'film', 'seriously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'Frasier', 'doubt', 'heart', 'soul', 'Encino', 'Man', 'So', 'yeah', 'film', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'anything', 'super', 'revolutionary', 'sure', 'whole', 'lotta', 'fun', 'really', ""n't"", 'anyone', 'can', 'ask', 'Food', 'Thought', 'Encino', 'Man', 'simple', '90', 'film', 'lot', 'era-specific', 'spirit', 'wo', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'find', 'anything', 'revolutionary', 'here', 'will', 'find', 'spunk', 'humour', 'heart', 'movie', 'lesser', 'known', 'cult-following', 'sure', 'please', 'fans', 'Bill', 'Ted', 'Excellent', 'Adventure', 'Wayne', 'World', 'was', 'always', 'childhood', 'favourite', 'mine', 'still', 'even', 'two', 'decades', 'very', 'least', ""'ll"", 'be', 'good', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'film']",N/A

Surprisingly, given his evident onscreen cranial development, Shore does not play the Encino Man, a role that goes to Brendan Fraser.In essence, Shore and company find a caveman adolescent while digging a pool in the yard and take him to high school. Of course there is a whole competition for the pretty girl (which concludes with some prom related mayhem and cake defiling) with much of the plot about fitting in. Needless to say the caveman, ""Link,"" becomes very popular, and learns to do many complex tasks (like driving a car on two wheels, and dancing to an absolutely wretched song apparently called ""She Likes to Feed The Monkey"") easily, while indirectly winning the Prom Queen amongst much drama. In the end there is an earthquake that sends Link's true love, a teenage cavewoman back from the Neolithic era for him to drool over, in what may be the single most contrived plot point in movie history.Be sure to watch for the ""hilarious"" cultural interactions in the Latino bar (the subtitles about cheese are amusing) which served only to make me wish that the INS was that effective in real life. For some reason this also gives Shore the excuse to start his trademark ""weasel"" bit in an odd mix of English and Spanish.This is ultra-light entertainment, yet has some modestly funny moments. This will be a hit with most teenage males, but won't convert anyone outside that demographic. The movie is essentially clean: it was rated ""PG"" in the US, the UK, Australia, and Singapore, rated ""T"" in Spain, rated ""7"" in Sweden, and received the desirable rating of ""L"" in Iceland.",3,The Weasel Interprets Unfrozen Caveman Adolescents,1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,1860,"['Though', 'not', 'as', 'amusing', 'Army', 'Now', 'conceptually', 'satisfying', 'Pauly', 'Shore', 'Dead', 'mercifully', 'less', 'painful', 'Bio-Dome', 'Encino', 'Man', 'typical', 'lighthearted', 'buffoonery', 'not', 'intended', 'anyone', 'not', 'demographic', 'males', 'aged', 'eight', 'twenty', 'Surprisingly', 'given', 'evident', 'onscreen', 'cranial', 'development', 'Shore', 'not', 'play', 'Encino', 'Man', 'role', 'Brendan', 'Fraser.In', 'essence', 'Shore', 'company', 'find', 'caveman', 'adolescent', 'digging', 'pool', 'yard', 'take', 'high', 'school', 'course', 'whole', 'competition', 'pretty', 'girl', 'prom', 'related', 'mayhem', 'cake', 'defiling', 'much', 'plot', 'fitting', 'Needless', 'say', 'caveman', 'Link', 'very', 'popular', 'learns', 'do', 'many', 'complex', 'tasks', 'driving', 'car', 'two', 'wheels', 'dancing', 'absolutely', 'wretched', 'song', 'apparently', 'called', 'Feed', 'Monkey', 'easily', 'indirectly', 'winning', 'Prom', 'Queen', 'amongst', 'much', 'drama', 'end', 'earthquake', 'Link', 'true', 'love', 'teenage', 'cavewoman', 'back', 'Neolithic', 'era', 'drool', 'over', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'single', 'most', 'contrived', 'plot', 'point', 'movie', 'history.Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'hilarious', 'cultural', 'interactions', 'Latino', 'bar', 'subtitles', 'cheese', 'are', 'amusing', 'served', 'only', 'make', 'wish', 'INS', 'was', 'effective', 'real', 'life', 'reason', 'also', 'Shore', 'excuse', 'start', 'trademark', 'weasel', 'bit', 'odd', 'mix', 'English', 'Spanish.This', 'ultra-light', 'entertainment', 'modestly', 'funny', 'moments', 'will', 'be', 'hit', 'most', 'teenage', 'males', 'wo', ""n't"", 'convert', 'anyone', 'demographic', 'movie', 'essentially', 'clean', 'was', 'rated', 'PG', 'US', 'UK', 'Australia', 'Singapore', 'rated', 'T', 'Spain', 'rated', '7', 'Sweden', 'received', 'desirable', 'rating', 'L', 'Iceland']",N/A

Encino Man and Pauly Shore is one of the reasons why the early 90s ruled.

And when they go to the Mountian and ride the Viper in reverse. And the drivers ed  scene when Link thinks it is Rad Mobile and he puts it up on two wheels and they end up at the bar with all the Mexicans. ""You see that girl muchacho. Dont look at her!"" The prom scene was cool to, it had Infectious Grooves in it. They are a real band but that song was made for the movie.
