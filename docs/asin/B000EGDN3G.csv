Don't have many of his albums, in fact come to think of it, I don't have any. I used to, but not anymore. Nevertheless, this concert I enjoyed. Its all Vegas, which you can't complain about. Great sets, excellent acoustics, brilliant clear pictures. All good. The concert itself, I thought was great. I felt like I was part of the show. I was involved with the stories and right into the music.I've read the reviews and adding mine to the mix I would have to say it's well worth having your own copy.

972427,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B000EGDN3G,Kathy W,"[20, 21]","Barry's phenomenal high-energy Manilow Mega-Vegas extravaganza!  With over 27 superb musical arrangements, spanning approximately 1  hours, Barry croons our favorites, like the eternally sexy ""Somewhere in the Night.""  He does a super-cool rendition of Mandy where he plays and sings along with a video clip of himself from his very early days.  Wait till you hear the `50s ""Bandstand Boogie"" and ""Venus,"" with Barry Avalonio, not to mention ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"" and ""Unchained Melody""!  You'll see a big stage Vegas set come down from the ceiling in Copacabana, `cause it is cookin'!  Barry's got fans rockin' in the audience from age 20 to 120 for this show, as a matter of fact, they hardly ever sit down! He does this DVD so well, you feel like you have a front row seat and he's singing directly to you.And if all that's not enough, there's a 2nd DVD, almost an hour long, full of behind-the-scenes extras, like tours, interviews, rehearsal, stage setup, photos, and three additional song clips.  Whaddah sweet deal!  This guy just keeps getting better all the time, a magnificent DVD from a super guy who truly values his fans.  Just when you were happy with the 110 % he always gives, he raises the bar to 130 % !No wonder this DVD set hit 3 times platinum barely a month after it's release!  ""Doctor, they won't have ta give ya something to get that feelin' again"" if you get this DVD!  And you'll want to watch it over and over again.PS--This makes a great gift for somebody who loves Manilow Musik!",5,Mega-Vegas Manilow,1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,1521,"['Barry', 'phenomenal', 'high-energy', 'Manilow', 'Mega-Vegas', 'extravaganza', '27', 'superb', 'musical', 'arrangements', 'spanning', 'approximately', '1', 'hours', 'Barry', 'favorites', 'eternally', 'sexy', 'Somewhere', 'Night', 'super-cool', 'rendition', 'Mandy', 'where', 'sings', 'video', 'clip', 'very', 'early', 'days', 'Wait', 'till', 'hear', '50s', 'Bandstand', 'Boogie', 'Venus', 'Barry', 'Avalonio', 'not', 'mention', 'Love', 'Many', 'Splendored', 'Thing', 'Unchained', 'Melody', ""'ll"", 'see', 'big', 'stage', 'Vegas', 'set', 'come', 'down', 'ceiling', 'Copacabana', 'cause', 'cookin', 'Barry', 'got', 'fans', 'rockin', 'audience', 'age', '20', '120', 'show', 'matter', 'fact', 'hardly', 'ever', 'sit', 'down', 'DVD', 'so', 'well', 'feel', 'have', 'front', 'row', 'seat', 'singing', 'directly', 'you.And', 'not', 'enough', '2nd', 'DVD', 'almost', 'hour', 'long', 'full', 'behind-the-scenes', 'extras', 'tours', 'interviews', 'rehearsal', 'stage', 'setup', 'photos', 'three', 'additional', 'song', 'clips', 'Whaddah', 'sweet', 'deal', 'guy', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'time', 'magnificent', 'DVD', 'super', 'guy', 'who', 'truly', 'fans', 'Just', 'when', 'were', 'happy', '110', '%', 'always', 'bar', '130', '%', 'wonder', 'DVD', 'set', 'hit', '3', 'times', 'platinum', 'barely', 'month', 'release', 'Doctor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'ta', 'give', 'ya', 'something', 'get', 'feelin', 'again', 'get', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'again.PS', 'great', 'gift', 'somebody', 'who', 'Manilow', 'Musik']",N/A

I can be super critical sometimes, but watching this DVD is just a pure joy! Barry has decided that he will tour no more, so if your like me and can't afford a trip to Las Vegas to see him in person this is our treat.  It is a very well put together show and is very entertaining from start to finish.  The second DVD is icing on the cake!  It's a ""how it's done"" story of the concert or show if you wish and well worth the watch.  Those who say the were disappointed in this DVD must have had a bad day.  My advice is watch it again.

This concert duplicates his live show perfectly and it is nothing short of fabulous. Barry is his usual self and the energy he shows during this concert especially at the end is amazing. I did not find his interaction with the audiance to be any less during this concert compared to any others. In fact he is much more energetic during this performance.
