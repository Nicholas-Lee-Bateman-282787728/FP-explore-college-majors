1329192,AP6L54VTCJKCQ,B0036U0B00,"Ardeal ""Emi""","[8, 9]","This is a great East European (Romanian) movie from 2007 based on actual events centered around a 1999 NATO mission in the Balkans. It has been available for years only as non-US DVD format.A train containing American Radar equipment is stopped in a small Romanian village due to missing paperwork. The beauty of the film in my opinion is the inclusion of flashbacks to the period shortly after WW2, when many disillusioned Romanians were eagerly awaiting the Americans to save them - a dream that never materialized during the existence of the iron curtain. It offers great insight into the mindsets of East Europeans, and their fascinations and disappointments with America.I like this movie even better than other successful Romanian movies, such as ""4 Months 3 Weeks 2 Days"" (which was voted the #1 movie of 2007 by Sight and Sound - considered by many the greatest authority on moviemaking), ""The Death of Mr. Lazarescu"", or ""12:08 East of Bucharest"".",5,Long Overdue in the U.S.,1266192000,"02 15, 2010",2010,956,"['great', 'East', 'European', 'Romanian', 'movie', '2007', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'centered', '1999', 'NATO', 'mission', 'Balkans', 'been', 'available', 'years', 'only', 'non-US', 'DVD', 'format.A', 'train', 'containing', 'American', 'Radar', 'equipment', 'stopped', 'small', 'Romanian', 'village', 'due', 'missing', 'paperwork', 'beauty', 'film', 'opinion', 'inclusion', 'flashbacks', 'period', 'shortly', 'WW2', 'when', 'many', 'disillusioned', 'Romanians', 'were', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'Americans', 'save', 'dream', 'never', 'materialized', 'existence', 'iron', 'curtain', 'great', 'insight', 'mindsets', 'East', 'Europeans', 'fascinations', 'disappointments', 'America.I', 'movie', 'even', 'better', 'other', 'successful', 'Romanian', 'movies', 'such', '4', 'Months', '3', 'Weeks', '2', 'Days', 'was', 'voted', '1', 'movie', '2007', 'Sight', 'Sound', 'considered', 'many', 'greatest', 'authority', 'moviemaking', 'Death', 'Mr.', 'Lazarescu', '12:08', 'East', 'Bucharest']",N/A

Williams ""mikey's girl""","[1, 1]","The Amazon reviewers for this film have made so many valuable observations that I will only add a few brief ones of my own: first, its a film that wants to be everything, dramatic and poignant, deliriously absurd and satirical, politically astute, a tender ""love story"" and a tutorial on the bloated nightmare that are socialist bureaucracies. Its the film of a young director/writer, apparently the only one he lived long enough to make. And that is a terrible thing to discover; perhaps it allows us to see the potential and not just the 'doing too much' syndrome, as if he were aware he would never have another 20 films to try out all his ideas? It was just 'awful' when it needed it to be, (really, a whorehouse a la Dracula???) and quite touching whenever the young men and women were shown caught in the cultural crossfire of what they need and what they think they want. The young woman who plays the daughter of the train station master was the heartbeat of the whole film.As for Assante, I disagree with the one reviewer as to it not being one of his better performances. I think it takes a consummate professional to know when they will have to carry the entire movie almost single handedly (ie. Gotti, Mambo Kings, Looking for an Echo, etc) and when they are part of a director's vision, a tapestry if you will, of many characters and voices. If anyone can dominate a film it would be Assante, fortunately for those whom he works with, from supporting cast to his directors, he also knows when to play the role he is given and not over reach, disrupt and otherwise savage the equilibrium of effects that a director may foolishly think they get to control! So, don't panic, its not Assante on the screen, its some stressed Marine commander who is stuck in the middle of nowhere Romania with a combustible dilemma and a town full of people who know more about being 'American' than 'we' do. He did fine.(As an example, one of my favorite roles for Assante is that of Bobby Tex in Q & A, he literally just steals that whole film, every last scene he is in! The give and take between him and the Luis Guzman - who is marvelous as Det. Valentin - is simply as good as it gets, and I think they loved working with each other, it certainly appears that way in the film).This is one of those films that requires multiple viewings, and do not assume that the smaller roles, especially that of the mayor and his adversary the train station master, are not the guts of the director's vision, indeed, they may well be the point at which the director began the idea for this film and then spread out from there into this wonderful fine 'mess'!",5,"a fine mess of a film, wonderful!",1301356800,"03 29, 2011",2011,2642,"['Amazon', 'reviewers', 'film', 'have', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'valuable', 'observations', 'will', 'only', 'add', 'few', 'brief', 'ones', 'own', 'first', 'film', 'be', 'everything', 'dramatic', 'poignant', 'deliriously', 'absurd', 'satirical', 'politically', 'astute', 'tender', 'love', 'story', 'tutorial', 'bloated', 'nightmare', 'are', 'socialist', 'bureaucracies', 'film', 'young', 'director/writer', 'apparently', 'only', 'one', 'lived', 'long', 'enough', 'make', 'terrible', 'thing', 'discover', 'perhaps', 'see', 'potential', 'not', 'just', ""'doing"", 'too', 'much', 'syndrome', 'were', 'aware', 'would', 'never', 'have', '20', 'films', 'try', 'out', 'ideas', 'was', 'just', ""'awful"", 'when', 'needed', 'be', 'really', 'whorehouse', 'la', 'Dracula', 'quite', 'touching', 'whenever', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'were', 'shown', 'caught', 'cultural', 'crossfire', 'what', 'need', 'what', 'think', 'want', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'daughter', 'train', 'station', 'master', 'was', 'heartbeat', 'whole', 'film.As', 'Assante', 'disagree', 'one', 'reviewer', 'not', 'being', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'think', 'consummate', 'professional', 'know', 'when', 'will', 'have', 'carry', 'entire', 'movie', 'almost', 'single', 'handedly', 'ie', 'Gotti', 'Mambo', 'Kings', 'Looking', 'Echo', 'etc', 'when', 'are', 'part', 'director', 'vision', 'tapestry', 'will', 'many', 'characters', 'voices', 'anyone', 'can', 'dominate', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'Assante', 'fortunately', 'whom', 'supporting', 'cast', 'directors', 'also', 'when', 'play', 'role', 'given', 'not', 'reach', 'disrupt', 'otherwise', 'savage', 'equilibrium', 'effects', 'director', 'may', 'foolishly', 'think', 'get', 'control', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'panic', 'not', 'Assante', 'screen', 'stressed', 'Marine', 'commander', 'who', 'stuck', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Romania', 'combustible', 'dilemma', 'town', 'full', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'more', 'being', ""'American"", ""'we"", 'do', 'did', 'fine', 'example', 'one', 'favorite', 'roles', 'Assante', 'Bobby', 'Tex', 'Q', 'A', 'literally', 'just', 'steals', 'whole', 'film', 'last', 'scene', 'give', 'take', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'who', 'marvelous', 'Det', 'Valentin', 'simply', 'as', 'good', 'think', 'loved', 'working', 'other', 'certainly', 'way', 'film', '.This', 'one', 'films', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'do', 'not', 'assume', 'smaller', 'roles', 'especially', 'mayor', 'adversary', 'train', 'station', 'master', 'are', 'not', 'guts', 'director', 'vision', 'indeed', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'point', 'director', 'began', 'idea', 'film', 'then', 'spread', 'out', 'there', 'wonderful', 'fine', ""'mess""]",N/A
1329194,A2KQX8Q4RNYN4R,B0036U0B00,Donald Negri,"[0, 0]","I'm totally beguiled by this film, warts and all. Yes,it's too long and cries out for editing (something the director would have done had he lived). So, I've played the editing role for my own pleasure and as artfully as can be done by just dubbing from one DVD deck to another. My goal, to trim from its 2h 30 minutes down to around 1h50, without of course sacrificing either the general narrative or well done scenes. So, I made the decision to totally eliminate the arc relative to Capt.Jones and the mayor and the factory workers - especially the drunken meeting with its totally implausible ""Unity"" cheers...On the same register, I cut out the scenes where Jones and some of the Romanian soldiers are invited to a hotel which appears a replica of Dallas, but also sports a copy of the Eiffel Tower. Again, I found it added nothing to the narrative and seems hollow when interspersed with the scenes involving David and Monica at the house party. Throw in a handful of shortening of scenes with long visuals - often of the train - and I was able to meet my goal and, in my humble opinion, make it a tighter viewing experience.Which leaves me with one question that editing can not address (short of eliminating the entire scene): the Bucharest epilogue. What to make of it other than to show us that two of the leading characters are alive and well 5 years later - and apparently rarely see each other.Yeah, one can wonder about Assante's role (a Capt. at  his age?), but the scenes between him and Doiaru are well done, poignant and certainly necessary for understanding Doiaru's true feelings about the American. And, for budgetary reasons I guess, most of the US Marines turn out to be Romanians........Having said the above, no matter what, this is a film that will stick with you and actually gets to be better with multiple viewings.",4,Do your own editing....,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",2012,1843,"[""'m"", 'totally', 'beguiled', 'film', 'warts', 'Yes', 'too', 'long', 'cries', 'out', 'editing', 'something', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'had', 'lived', 'So', ""'ve"", 'played', 'editing', 'role', 'own', 'pleasure', 'as', 'artfully', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'just', 'dubbing', 'one', 'DVD', 'deck', 'goal', 'trim', '2h', '30', 'minutes', 'down', '1h50', 'course', 'sacrificing', 'general', 'narrative', 'well', 'done', 'scenes', 'So', 'made', 'decision', 'totally', 'eliminate', 'arc', 'relative', 'Capt.Jones', 'mayor', 'factory', 'workers', 'especially', 'drunken', 'meeting', 'totally', 'implausible', 'Unity', 'cheers', 'same', 'register', 'cut', 'out', 'scenes', 'where', 'Jones', 'Romanian', 'soldiers', 'are', 'invited', 'hotel', 'replica', 'Dallas', 'also', 'sports', 'copy', 'Eiffel', 'Tower', 'Again', 'found', 'added', 'nothing', 'narrative', 'hollow', 'when', 'interspersed', 'scenes', 'involving', 'David', 'Monica', 'house', 'party', 'Throw', 'handful', 'shortening', 'scenes', 'long', 'visuals', 'often', 'train', 'was', 'able', 'meet', 'goal', 'humble', 'opinion', 'make', 'tighter', 'viewing', 'experience.Which', 'leaves', 'one', 'question', 'editing', 'can', 'not', 'address', 'short', 'eliminating', 'entire', 'scene', 'Bucharest', 'epilogue', 'What', 'make', 'other', 'show', 'two', 'leading', 'characters', 'are', 'alive', 'well', '5', 'years', 'later', 'apparently', 'rarely', 'see', 'other.Yeah', 'one', 'can', 'wonder', 'Assante', 'role', 'Capt', 'age', 'scenes', 'Doiaru', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'poignant', 'certainly', 'necessary', 'understanding', 'Doiaru', 'true', 'feelings', 'American', 'budgetary', 'reasons', 'guess', 'most', 'US', 'Marines', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'Romanians', '..Having', 'said', 'above', 'matter', 'what', 'film', 'will', 'stick', 'actually', 'be', 'better', 'multiple', 'viewings']",N/A
1329195,A23IV3DK4EAXJH,B0036U0B00,"fCh ""fCh""","[2, 2]","In addition to the comic dimension, well captured so far by the other reviews, there are a few more lessons in here.  This film shows the difference between the perceptions of time in two places in the world.  The typical Americans transiting Romania had no clue there had been at least one episode of common history, which was still running for (some on) the other side.  This differential in awareness, together with a breakdown in assumptions/communication, developed at the regular people's levels, takes the events to yet another one-sided episode of loss and tragedy.The story is highly allegorical, and some may wish it went on faster.  War time memory of family and wealth loss, the aftermath of socialism, social and institutional breakdown, general lack of direction/vision, and a young generation with aspirations for western uniformity/conformity as a way to escape its place and time, are the contextual elements of the hosts.  The Americans are most typical, unassuming, genuine until they can pragmatically move on with their agenda, and teflon-like relative to the complexities of the host place.  A love story and mini-tragedy are brewing; hit play, sit back and take it all in, for laughs and reflection, alike!Actors play well and seem appropriately distributed.  Editing would have probably been an area the late director might have chosen to work in, had he caught another day.  No extras, yet too many ads for other films--too bad, a film like this needs a little context, for there is more than comedy to it. All in all, this is yet another gem from a national cinema of which little is known outside Romania.________________________I'd not be surprised if the US military has been experiencing similar episodes elsewhere.",5,"for laughs and reflection, a gem from a national cinema of which little is known",1291334400,"12 3, 2010",2010,1745,"['addition', 'comic', 'dimension', 'well', 'captured', 'so', 'far', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'lessons', 'here', 'film', 'difference', 'perceptions', 'time', 'two', 'places', 'world', 'typical', 'Americans', 'transiting', 'Romania', 'had', 'clue', 'there', 'had', 'been', 'least', 'one', 'episode', 'common', 'history', 'was', 'still', 'running', 'other', 'side', 'differential', 'awareness', 'together', 'breakdown', 'assumptions/communication', 'developed', 'regular', 'people', 'levels', 'events', 'yet', 'one-sided', 'episode', 'loss', 'tragedy.The', 'story', 'highly', 'allegorical', 'may', 'wish', 'went', 'faster', 'War', 'time', 'memory', 'family', 'wealth', 'loss', 'aftermath', 'socialism', 'social', 'institutional', 'breakdown', 'general', 'lack', 'direction/vision', 'young', 'generation', 'aspirations', 'western', 'uniformity/conformity', 'way', 'escape', 'place', 'time', 'are', 'contextual', 'elements', 'hosts', 'Americans', 'are', 'most', 'typical', 'unassuming', 'genuine', 'can', 'pragmatically', 'move', 'agenda', 'teflon-like', 'relative', 'complexities', 'host', 'place', 'love', 'story', 'mini-tragedy', 'are', 'brewing', 'hit', 'play', 'sit', 'back', 'take', 'laughs', 'reflection', 'alike', 'Actors', 'play', 'well', 'seem', 'appropriately', 'distributed', 'Editing', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'area', 'late', 'director', 'might', 'have', 'chosen', 'work', 'had', 'caught', 'day', 'extras', 'yet', 'too', 'many', 'ads', 'other', 'films', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'little', 'context', 'more', 'comedy', 'yet', 'gem', 'national', 'cinema', 'little', 'known', 'outside', 'Romania.________________________I', ""'d"", 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'US', 'military', 'been', 'experiencing', 'similar', 'episodes', 'elsewhere']",N/A
1329196,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B0036U0B00,Haunted Flower,"[4, 6]","""California Dreamin'"" is an independent movie written and directed by Cristian Nemescu with the writing of Catherine Linstrum and Tudor Voican. Based on a true story, a U.S. military officer Doug Jones played by Armand Assante leads a train full of Marines and equipment on the way to a NATO outpost when they are delayed in a village stuffed with bureaucracy, strange pop culture traditions, and romance. Said to be ""one of the best films about how American is perceived abroad ever made"" by the Washington Post, this socio-political satire tries to illustrate that truth can be more absurd than fiction.Right away this ""comedy"" begins on a downer with a reminder that the film is a tribute to the director who died in a tragic car accident. Then the film opens in the 1940s as a bombing is taking place in a residential area. Then it flashes forward to May 1999 where a platoon of American Marines has arrived in Romania with a military radar shipment to be deployed near the Serbian border to aid NATO air raids. While passing through a town on train, they are stopped by the locals and citing paperwork requirements manage to keep them there for several days.All the characters have different objectives working against each other. The major of the village wants the Americans' stay to be as pleasant as possible so sets up a village celebration to try to drum up interest in investing in their local budget with lots of red, white, and blue flags and even an Elvis impersonator. One of my favorite moments is when a Romanian decides to play ""Achy Breaky Heart"" on the radio to warm those American hearts (and wallets). The teacher in a classroom attempts to educate the children about the country of the United States and he brings up of points of interest like, ""Washington is the capital even though it isn't the largest city."" The women are hoping to bag a U.S. soldier so they try to master the art of seduction quickly. There are factory workers on strike who want to buy the factory themselves to secure their children's future. And of course, the Americans just want to continue on their mission as quickly as possible and get out of there and clumsily offer bribes that aren't taken.After over two hours watcher time and five days movie time of stalemate between the Americans and the Romanians, a giant fight breaks out seemingly out of nowhere with bats and some people including a main character are bludgeoned to death (not involving the Americans). The comedy stops here. It feels like an abrupt end to a long, wordy movie.If you enjoyed ""In the Loop"" for its satire, you'll enjoy the tone here. What I enjoyed about ""In the Loop"" was mainly the many creative ways the characters insulted each other, but the humor here is mainly in the way other countries view America and how the Romanians try to use their knowledge of the country to relate and appeal to the Marines. At one point the Captain gives a huge rallying speech to the people where he wants them all to unite together for one purpose and while it was part of his larger character arc, it just didn't hook the way it normally would because it didn't seem to fit in this movie. The movie was in the process of being edited when its director died and as a tribute, no one else touched what he had put together so some issues like the length of the movie and scenes that didn't quite fit well enough may have been cut in retrospect but we'll never know. If you decide to check this one out, be prepared to leave the subtitles on with all the switching between English and Romanian and even a bit of Spanish.DVD Extras:A trailer. Woot!

A train full of US Marines en route to Kosovo in 1999 gets stopped at a village train station in rural Romania, and lacking papers for the cargo onboard find themselves waiting five days until the red tape is untangled. Five days are enough to tangle a lot more than red tape, as the soldiers get romantically involved with the local girls and the ambitions of the town's mayor and a bunch of striking workers from a local factory complicate matters further. Meanwhile, there is time for a village celebration with an Elvis impersonator, the belated explosion of some WWII ordinance takes down the town's electrical grid, and some of the soldiers are treated to a Transylvanian girlie show.At the center of it all are the CO of the troop of soldiers and his second in command, a young sergeant who gets attached to one of the local girls, though neither of them knows a word of the other's language. Her nicely performed rebellion and eventual escape from the provincial environment she hates is a through-line from scene one to the end. There are probably a few too many subplots in this 2.5-hour movie for the whole thing to hang together coherently. But there's so much energy in the camera-work and the performances that the slow parts don't last long before you are swept along again in the comic absurdities of the overall story.The original film is in both English and Romanian, and viewers may prefer that version to a dubbed one, especially as much of the comedy involves the difficulties and misunderstandings that result from language barriers.
