1010653,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B000H6SXW4,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[2, 9]","I have no extraneous insight into AWA before watching this DVD.  But with only this DVD as reference, I see AWA as a business that failed simply because it lost some great superstars early on to the WWF, and lost some TV stations later on.There's not much insight into the backstage going-ons of the business.  The entire first 20 minutes of this 1 hour and 40 minute documentary is devoted to such hyperbolic extollation and utter ass-kissing of Verne Gagne that the people talking about him instantly lose all credibility.Can you honestly believe a man who says that Verne Gagne was AS FAMOUS as friggin JOHN WAYNE or CARY GRANT?  Anyone who truly believes that is quite frankly delusional, and/or lives in a world revolving around wrestling and wrestling alone.Nothing backed up these claims or numbers, not even the footage.  They showed some clearly BS pictures of Verne as a wrestler, with a full head of hair and a rippling muscular body, then proceed to show footage from the same era of him almost completely bald on top, and as flabbily built as the average wrestler of the pre-WWF bodybuilder/steroid days.I wouldn't doubt Verne's skills or fame if they hadn't insanely inflated it, and start talking about how Verne was an innovator of such styles and moves, while the footage shown in concert with the commentary almost shows the complete opposite.  Verne's ""quick style"" move consisted of a lazy tripping of an opponent by tripping his leg with his hand.  The ""high flying move"" was a rope-assisted headscissors to take an opponent into the ring.From there, the documentary does start going in on the star power Verne created or brought in, and the building up of a vast and powerful wrestling program that was the WWF of its day it seemed.And yet of all the praise and extollation being given onto AWA and Verne Gagne, none of it ever really points out specific incidents of genius booking or well-executed writing or the in-ring product beyond clips of people doing basic 80s wrestling, with the occasional break-out clips featuring the likes of the Midnight Rockers or Curt Hennig and others.Once the problems begin with AWA, it starts to tell of supposed ""big mistakes"" and stupid ideas AWA suffered, and how Verne failed to keep up with the times.  But the biggest problem in this is that they don't tell us HOW.  HOW was a certain event a big mistake?I am a little child of 20 who only really started watching wrestling in 2000.  I don't know what the situation in AWA was.  That is why I turn to DVDs like this to LEARN about wrestling history so I can appreciate it with the old people, too!But how am I supposed to know that a collaboration show featuring all the best AWA talent and all the best NWA talent on one show was a total failure and a huge mistake?  They imply that perhaps it was due to the timing---it was the week after Survivor Series, so perhaps all the wrestling fans who'd spent 30 dollars on that were suddenly too broke a week later to pay for another PPV event of the same price.How am I supposed to know that a certain PPV event with such huge build behind it was a catastrophic failure despite such great extollation and virtues being cast upon the talent and the performance?Why does Verne not pay Jerry Lawler accordingly after he wins the AWA championship, then paint Lawler out to be the jerkass when he runs back to Memphis with the AWA belt and no intention to wrestle for Verne until he gets rightfully paid?  Why does Verne refuse to pay Hulk Hogan his due cut of Hulk merchandise when he's becoming the absolute biggest wrestling star in the US, then raise all sorts of hell with him leaving for the WWF?  Why did Verne sell Hulk merchandise while Hulk was in Japan, and not give Hogan any part of that cut?  What roles did these events play in AWA's gradual downfall?And then comes its downfall.  What the hell happened?  I wouldn't know from watching this DVD.  From what I saw, the AWA started to mysteriously suffer a huge buyrate drop in their PPVs, and the WWF upped the pressure on them, and then AWA suddenly died and was sold to McMahon.  At least I think that's how it happened.  So much time was just spent on Verne Gagne, Verne Gagne's refusal to accede to McMahon's initial offer to buy AWA for millions, and Verne Gagne and his family mourning after AWA dies.To make some company comparisons, the waning days of AWA, as portrayed in this DVD, seemed to mirror those of the WWE today.  This wasn't like WCW where the company heads seemed to be throwing random words in a pile of glue and making storylines and random SWERVES based on what words stuck, while buyrates plummeted into fractions of 0.0something and ratings shriveled to the 1's and 2's.  This wasn't like ECW where the company was completely broke for the last year of its life, before having its TV deal pulled and being left completely dead in the water and 8 million dollars in debt.The DVD is more about Verne Gagne than it is about the American Wrestling Association.  If the DVD had a nose, it would be so thickly brown as to be darkly black.In my view, this DVD's WWE equivalent would be ""McMahon"".  And that's not a compliment.  ""McMahon"" didn't claim to be a history of the WWF/WWE; it was a ""biography"" of Vince McMahon.That's what this DVD is.  A ""biography"" of Verne Gagne.",1,"The Spectacular Legacy of Verne Gagne, and how he was as famous as John Wayne and Cary Grant(?!)",1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,5316,"['have', 'extraneous',

1010654,A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST,B000H6SXW4,Best Of All,"[3, 4]","With 13 matches spanning nearly 20 years, along with interviews with many of the stars - Verne Gagne and his son, Greg, Hulk Hogan, Baron Von Raschke, Bobby Heenan, ""Mean"" Gene Okerlund and Nick Bockwinkel - the two-DVD set is an important addition to the video library of any wrestling fan.Founded by the legendary amateur and professional wrestler, Verne Gagne, and Wally Karbo, the American Wrestling Association was based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and operated from 1957-1991. The documentary portion provides a complete overview of the company's operation, with the matches from 1971 to 1988, and 10 of the bouts from the 1980s.The AWA had a nationally-syndicated program throughout its existence, ran major shows - a forerunner to the WWE's WrestleMania spectacles - and marketed itself through a cable-TV program in the 1980s. Verne Gagne was not only the owner, but trained many of the wrestlers and held the company's world title 10 times.The AWA revolutionized the industry in many ways, which makes the limited scope of this release a major drawback. But it would arguably be an impossible task to contain the cost by releasing a series of multi-disc, boxed sets. The project editors at WWE - owners of the AWA footage - did as good a job as possible to satisfy older fans who remember the AWA, while placing the company in a proper historical perspective for the new generation of enthusiasts.",5,An Absolute Must For A Pro Wrestling Fan,1198627200,"12 26, 2007",2007,1406,"['13', 'matches', 'spanning', 'nearly', '20', 'years', 'interviews', 'many', 'stars', 'Verne', 'Gagne', 'son', 'Greg', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Baron', 'Von', 'Raschke', 'Bobby', 'Heenan', 'Mean', 'Gene', 'Okerlund', 'Nick', 'Bockwinkel', 'two-DVD', 'set', 'important', 'addition', 'video', 'library', 'wrestling', 'fan.Founded', 'legendary', 'amateur', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'Verne', 'Gagne', 'Wally', 'Karbo', 'American', 'Wrestling', 'Association', 'was', 'based', 'Minneapolis', 'Minnesota', 'operated', '1957-1991', 'documentary', 'portion', 'complete', 'overview', 'company', 'operation', 'matches', '1971', '1988', '10', 'bouts', '1980s.The', 'AWA', 'had', 'nationally-syndicated', 'program', 'existence', 'ran', 'major', 'shows', 'forerunner', 'WWE', 'WrestleMania', 'marketed', 'cable-TV', 'program', '1980s', 'Verne', 'Gagne', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'owner', 'trained', 'many', 'wrestlers', 'held', 'company', 'world', 'title', '10', 'times.The', 'AWA', 'revolutionized', 'industry', 'many', 'ways', 'limited', 'scope', 'release', 'major', 'drawback', 'would', 'arguably', 'be', 'impossible', 'task', 'contain', 'cost', 'releasing', 'series', 'multi-disc', 'boxed', 'sets', 'project', 'editors', 'WWE', 'owners', 'AWA', 'footage', 'did', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'possible', 'satisfy', 'older', 'fans', 'who', 'remember', 'AWA', 'placing', 'company', 'proper', 'historical', 'perspective', 'new', 'generation', 'enthusiasts']",WWE: The Spectacular Legacy of the American Wrestling Association

I remember wrestlers who would come to the WWE and were in WWE at one time or another. One of my favoirte broadcasters from the AWA was Larry Nelson who was interviewed somebody like Sergeant Slaughter who would be in a huge feud with that nasty South African Mercinary Col. DeBiers who was one wrestler I just hated. The Sarge was one of my favorites and he was telling us fans that he is proud of all of us as Americans for standing up for our country and him. Sergeant Slaughter was not just a great wrestler but a former United States Marine Corps drill instructor. Rick Martel was another favorite I enjoyed as well as the great Vern Gagne and his son Greg Gagne. One match that Greg Gagne was in was when he was teamed up with the late Curt Henning. Curt Henning turned on Greg Gagne renewing an old feud. That feud dated back to when their fathers did not like each other one bit. There are alot of great memories of the AWA and the wrestlers who made this great organization a success. It is too bad it is gone but there are alot of fans who enjoyed watching this great wrestling organization that launched the careers of Bobby &#34;the Brain&#34; Heenan, Hulk Hogan, and others who would be in the WWE when their time came to come.",5,Remembering the American Wrestling Association,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",2014,1309,"['remember', 'watching', 'American', 'Wrestling', 'Association', 'ESPN', 'alot', 'remember', 'wrestlers', 'who', 'would', 'come', 'WWE', 'were', 'WWE', 'one', 'time', 'One', 'favoirte', 'broadcasters', 'AWA', 'was', 'Larry', 'Nelson', 'who', 'was', 'interviewed', 'somebody', 'Sergeant', 'Slaughter', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'huge', 'feud', 'nasty', 'South', 'African', 'Mercinary', 'Col.', 'DeBiers', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'wrestler', 'just', 'hated', 'Sarge', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', 'was', 'telling', 'fans', 'proud', 'Americans', 'standing', 'up', 'country', 'Sergeant', 'Slaughter', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'wrestler', 'former', 'United', 'States', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'drill', 'instructor', 'Rick', 'Martel', 'was', 'favorite', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'Vern', 'Gagne', 'son', 'Greg', 'Gagne', 'One', 'match', 'Greg', 'Gagne', 'was', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'teamed', 'up', 'late', 'Curt', 'Henning', 'Curt', 'Henning', 'turned', 'Greg', 'Gagne', 'renewing', 'old', 'feud', 'feud', 'dated', 'back', 'when', 'fathers', 'did', 'not', 'other', 'one', 'bit', 'are', 'alot', 'great', 'memories', 'AWA', 'wrestlers', 'who', 'made', 'great', 'organization', 'success', 'too', 'bad', 'gone', 'are', 'alot', 'fans', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'great', 'wrestling', 'organization', 'launched', 'careers', 'Bobby', '34', 'Brain', '34', 'Heenan', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'others', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'WWE', 'when', 'time', 'came', 'come']",WWE: The Spectacular Legacy of the American Wrestling Association

1010657,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B000H6SXW4,D.P.,"[19, 22]","Before I get started, let me just say that I'm an unbiased fan because I never had the chance to actually see & follow the AWA when it was around unlike how I was able to with WCW & ECW. This is the 3rd attempt at WWE telling the history of another promotion & based on their previous two DVD sets of promotions, this documentary was either going in one of two directions. It was either going the way of ""Rise & Fall Of ECW"" where they spent time & went into heavy detail about how it's ideas had a heavy influence in professional wrestling today...or ""Monday Night War"" where they heavily focused on the negatives of the company & downplay the influence that company had on professional wrestling. Well, this DVD I saw went the way of the Monday Night War where I just saw a burial of the promotion by everyone involved except the main players of the company. And by the way, Ric Flair isn't interviewed or even mentioned until the closing the of documentary when they were naming off the wrestlers Gagne trained despite being on the cover, talk about false advertising! Bottom line is that this DVD follows the path of WCW in ""Monday Night War"" & Ultimate Warrior's DVD in which they build them up only to completely knock them down & out by the end of the feature.Verne Gagne's background growing up kicks off the documentary along with the story of how the National Wrestling Alliance was born & eventually split up into the WWE, AWA, and NWA. How Gagne ran his territory & trained wrestlers followed by his innovations into the wrestling business (ala ""The Wrestler"" movie) are also glossed upon along with his strict rules & his idea of keeping ""kayfabe."" From here you'll get introductions into the early AWA stars such as Bobby Heenan, Nick Bockwinkle, the High Flyers, Texas Outlaws, Baron Von Raschke, Jesse Ventura, Superstar Billy Graham, Mad Dog Vachon, Gene Okerland, and others. The documentary takes a turn for the worse here as they cover Hulk Hogan breaking in and how Hulkamania was beginning in the AWA before Hogan leaving over money issues. Other talent started to talk about how they followed Hogan out of the AWA & were paid more money not to finish out their contractual agreements that Vince denied despite what the actual talent said. The title reigns of Rick Martel & Greg Gagne are briefly talked about in a negative light along with Larry Zbyszko's later in the documentary with Jerry Lawler saying he only got the title because he was Verne's son-in-law. The idea behind the SuperClash events were talked about and the reasons why that concept just wasn't working between all the promoters involved. The Stan Hansen title reign was discussed to the point to where it made Verne & the AWA look like complete idiots for giving him the title when his loyalties only lied with himself & working in Japan. The ESPN deal they had along with the new generation of talent coming into the company such as the Road Warriors, Sherri Martel, Eric Bischoff & the Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels & Marty Jannetty) is reduced to the idea that they only came into the company so they would get noticed by Vince with Sherri even admitting it. The entire story behind Jerry Lawler winning the title in a unification match and all the politics behind the match is talked about before Lawler explains why he never defended the title & still has it with him today. The idea behind a Team Challenge series that happened in the dying days of the company are discussed along with a state lawsuit that eventually ended the company. They end the documentary on a positive note stating the story behind Verne's induction into the Hall Of Fame despite people like Ricky Steamboat not approving of it.The DVD extras include interview outtakes such as Jim Brunzell telling stories about ""ribs"" in the company, the entrance & exit of the Freebirds told by Michael Hayes, Eric Bischoff telling the story of him coming into the AWA & eventually being an announcer, and several wrestlers talking about a plane ride with Mad Dog Vachon. The real gem of the interview outtakes were several stories by Nick Bockwinkle talking about things like a joke Bobby Heenan played on an announcer, his longest night of wrestling, and his favorite match. Along with outtakes were various AWA promos with Gene Okerland featuring Bobby Heenan, East-West Connection, and Mad Dog Vachon with a pine box.The second disc is complete with 13 matches BUT only 5 are shown in full...and one of them is already available on another DVD set. All the clipped matches show around 10 mins. of the match AT THE MOST with most of them having interview segments before & after the match. I mean it comes off at highlights more than actually wrestling matches. The only matches shown in full are a cage match between the Midnight Rockers vs. Buddy Rose & Doug Somers (not the match on HBK's DVD), High Flyers vs. Nick Bockwinkel & Ray Stevens (with the introduction of Heenan as their manager), Pat Patterson & Ray Stevens vs. Billy Robinson & Frankie Hill, and two AWA Championship matches featuring Curt Henning vs. Nick Bockwinkel & a unification match with Jerry Lawler vs. WCCW Champion Kerry Von Erich (same match on ""Greatest Stars Of The 80's""). The other clipped matches are: Verne Gagne & Mad Dog Vachon vs. East-West Connection, Verne Gagne vs. Nick Bockwinkel, High Flyers vs. East-West Connection, Nick Bockwinkle vs. Hulk Hogan (not the match on Hogan's DVD), Jesse Ventura vs. Baron Von Raschke, Hulk Hogan vs. Mr. Saito & Mr. Hatori, and Road Warriors & Paul Ellering vs. The Crusher & Larry Hennig & Curt Henning.Overall, I was heavily disappointed as I just felt that this company to be around as long as it was & bring in so many legends to this sport as it did, it just painted an ugly picture of this company & I felt Greg Gagne's induction speech of this dad at the Hall Of Fame did more justice to the company than this DVD did. So much information on here was incorrect like Jim Ross talking about how the Mid-South/UWF promotion didn't want to participate in the SuperClash PPV but yet the UWF was absorbed into Jim Crockett Promotions around a year before the PPV, AWA legend Dick The Bruiser wasn't even mentioned once, and they put over the fact that Greg Gagne was AWA Champion (including a picture of him wearing the belt) when Greg never held the AWA Championship.  This is only good for some archival footage & to see the old wrestling legends like Nick Bockwinkel & Baron Van Raschke but nothing past that. I recommend for a rental & see where you go from there.",2,WWE spits on a Spectacular Legacy?,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,6561,"['get', 'started', 'let', 'just', 'say', ""'m"", 'unbiased', 'fan',

I wasn't impressed by it as a young man but now that I've seen a good portion of its history thanks to this release, I have a new appreciation of what that league meant to this industry.My eyes widened at all the stars that were grown there. I knew of Verne Gange, Greg Gange, Curt Hennig, Larry ""The Ax"" Hennig, Nick Bockwinkle, Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan, the late Ray ""The Crippler"" Stevens, Mad Dog Vachon, Baron Von Rashke, The Crusher, Dick The Bruiser and a few others. I didn't know, however, that Dusty Rhodes, the late Dick Murdoch, Wahoo McDaniel, ""Superstar"" Billy Graham, Ricky Steamboat, Bob Backlund, Wendi Ritcher, Ric Flair and a few others got their main start there.Often forgotten because either the WWE, World Class or the old NWA made them such stars is that the AWA helped The Road Warriors, Shawn Michaels (during his Midnight Rocker days), Scott Hall (prior to his Razor Ramon days), The Fabulous Freebirds, the late ""Sensational"" Sherri Martel, Madusa Michelli (aka Alundra Blayze from her WWE days), Paul Heyman (Paul E. Dangerously) and others during their historic careers as well!What's sad is that a lot of stars and promotional things that made the AWA such a power during the 70's and early 80's were copied to some extent by Vince McMahon and WWE. Don't get me wrong, Vince made them his own BUT no one is going to convince me that he wasn't at least influenced by the AWA.What's also sad is that if Verne would've just kept up with the times, the AWA MIGHT still be around now! Still, he seems like a good old man. He's one of the few wrestlers I wouldn't mind meeting. I would probably just let him talk because I would love to hear some great stories from him. Nick Bockwinkle and Bobby Hennan would be two others too.Anyway, to concure with The Main Main, this set is worth it for the documentary alone! The extras are pretty good but the bonus matches I found a bit lacking because half of them are only partially shown. Beyond that, I still give this set 5 stars because of the documentary.Highly recommended for any serious pro wrestling fan that wants to learn more about the history of the business!

However, where did these wrestlers come from and how did they get started? Just like any other profession, before you make it to the big leagues you have to pay your dues somewhere. The AWA Wrestling association so you how the wrestlers got there start and the dues that they had to paid to before making it big in the WWF. Sergeant Slaughter and Jerry Blackwell take on the Road Warriors Hawk and Animal for the AWA Tag Team Championship. The Incredible Hulk Hogan takes on Mr. Saito and Dr. Dave Shultz in a handy cap match. You'll here Mean gene Okerland name mention as the time keeper. Rick Martel and Tito Santana face of against Jim Brunzell and Greg Gagne for some AWA Gold inside of a steel cage. You'll also see the East and West Connection also know as Jessie The Body Ventura and Adorable Adrian Adonis. Heavyweight Champion Nick Bockwenkle takes on terry Allen who went on to WCW as Magnum TA. Now let's talk about the legend of Andre the Giant. Andre was born may 19th 1946. His grandmother measured in at 7 foot 8 inches. At age 12, Andre was already a very big boy standing 6'4 and weigh over 200lbs. Andre was working as furniture maker when he was approached about being a wrestler. Andre started wrestling when he was 17 years old. At the age of 19, Andre was over 7 feet tall and 335 lbs. One of Andre matches in AWA was against Jerry Blackwell who weighs over 473 lbs himself. This was a $5000.00 slam match on 11-4-80 with the first wrestler to slam the other gets the cash. Andre was introduced to his first battle royal on October 17 1982, where the winner of this match gets 100 thousand dollars. Some of the wrestlers that were in the ring at the time were jerry Blackwell, Jessie Ventura, Bobby Heenan, Nick Bockwenkle, and Ken Patera. Then on November 11th 1982 Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant teamed up together to face the Nick Bockwenkle, Ken Patera, Dungam and Heenan himself. Wahoo McDaniel also made his debut in the AWA in 1969 before he went to WCW also. Other wrestlers that came up through the AWA were The Fabulous Freebirds, Curt Henning, Rick Flair, and Magnum TA. Larry Zbysko, Superstar Billy Graham. If you think that Vince McMahon is the only owner to get into a ring then you never saw Verne Gagne wrestle. I believe that most of Vince McMahon's ideas in the early years were taken from the AWA. At Wrestlemania, two when Rowdy Roddy Piper faces Mr. T in a boxing match that idea had already been used by the AWA. The idea of the Heenan family also was used in the AWA. Vince didn't make Hulk Hogan the legend that he is because he also use the same name in the AWA it was also funny watching Mean Gene Okerland move up the ranks from a time keeper, to doing locker-room interviews to doing wrestling commentary. The match between the Andre the Giant and Big John Studd at Wrestlemania one as the 15 thousand dollar slam match also came from AWA. If you think about it, most of McMahon idea came from other wrestling organization. If you really watch this DVD, you'll fine that if it wasn't for the AWA, I don't think the WWF would be where it's at today. In addition, you see that some of the wrestlers were in two different organizations also. For instant Ric flair was wrestling in the AWA at the same time that he was wrestling for World Championship Wrestling. Overall, I give this picture 10 weasel stars because it was such a revelation as far as understanding the world of professional wrestling back in the late 70s and early 80s.",5,A Real Eye Opener,1174694400,"03 24, 2007",2007,3565,"['watch', 'Wrestlemania', 'Summer', 'Slam', 'Survivor', 'series', 'Royal', 'rumble', 'However', 'where', 'did', 'wrestlers', 'come', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'started', 'Just', 'other', 'profession', 'make', 'big', 'leagues', 'have', 'pay', 'dues', 'somewhere', 'AWA', 'Wrestling', 'association', 'so', 'how', 'wrestlers', 'got', 'there', 'start', 'dues', 'had', 'paid', 'making', 'big', 'WWF', 'Sergeant', 'Slaughter', 'Jerry', 'Blackwell', 'take', 'Road', 'Warriors', 'Hawk', 'Animal', 'AWA', 'Tag', 'Team', 'Championship', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Mr.', 'Saito', 'Dr.', 'Dave', 'Shultz', 'handy', 'cap', 'match', ""'ll"", 'here', 'Mean', 'gene', 'Okerland', 'name', 'mention', 'time', 'keeper', 'Rick', 'Martel', 'Tito', 'Santana', 'face', 'Jim', 'Brunzell', 'Greg', 'Gagne', 'AWA', 'Gold', 'inside', 'steel', 'cage', ""'ll"", 'also', 'see', 'East', 'West', 'Connection', 'also', 'know', 'Jessie', 'Body', 'Ventura', 'Adorable', 'Adrian', 'Adonis', 'Heavyweight', 'Champion', 'Nick', 'Bockwenkle', 'terry', 'Allen', 'who', 'went', 'WCW', 'Magnum', 'TA', 'Now', 'let', 'talk', 'legend', 'Andre', 'Giant', 'Andre', 'was', 'born', 'may', '19th', '1946', 'grandmother', 'measured', '7', 'foot', '8', 'inches', 'age', '12', 'Andre', 'was', 'already', 'very', 'big', 'boy', 'standing', '6', '4', 'weigh', '200lbs', 'Andre', 'was', 'working', 'furniture', 'maker', 'when', 'was', 'approached', 'being', 'wrestler', 'Andre', 'started', 'wrestling', 'when', 'was', '17', 'years', 'old', 'age', '19', 'Andre', 'was', '7', 'feet', 'tall', '335', 'lbs', 'One', 'Andre', 'matches', 'AWA', 'was', 'Jerry', 'Blackwell', 'who', '473', 'lbs', 'was', '5000.00', 'slam', 'match', '11-4-80', 'first', 'wrestler', 'slam', 'other', 'cash', 'Andre', 'was', 'introduced', 'first', 'battle', 'royal', 'October', '17', '1982', 'where', 'winner', 'match', '100', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'wrestlers', 'were', 'ring', 'time', 'were', 'jerry', 'Blackwell', 'Jessie', 'Ventura', 'Bobby', 'Heenan', 'Nick', 'Bockwenkle', 'Ken', 'Patera', 'Then', 'November', '11th', '1982', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'Andre', 'Giant', 'teamed', 'up', 'together', 'face', 'Nick', 'Bockwenkle', 'Ken', 'Patera', 'Dungam', 'Heenan', 'Wahoo', 'McDaniel', 'also', 'made', 'debut', 'AWA', '1969', 'went', 'WCW', 'also', 'Other', 'wrestlers', 'came', 'up', 'AWA', 'were', 'Fabulous', 'Freebirds', 'Curt', 'Henning', 'Rick', 'Flair', 'Magnum', 'TA', 'Larry', 'Zbysko', 'Superstar', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'think', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'only', 'owner', 'get', 'ring', 'then', 'never', 'saw', 'Verne', 'Gagne', 'wrestle', 'believe', 'most', 'Vince', 'McMahon', 'ideas', 'early', 'years', 'were', 'taken', 'AWA', 'Wrestlemania', 'two', 'when', 'Rowdy', 'Roddy', 'Piper', 'Mr.', 'T', 'boxing', 'match', 'idea', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'used', 'AWA', 'idea', 'Heenan', 'family', 'also', 'was', 'used', 'AWA', 'Vince', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'Hulk', 'Hogan', 'legend', 'also', 'use', 'same', 'name', 'AWA', 'was', 'also', 'funny', 'watching', 'Mean', 'Gene', 'Okerland', 'move', 'up', 'ranks', 'time', 'keeper', 'doing', 'locker-room', 'interviews', 'doing', 'wrestling', 'commentary', 'match', 'Andre', 'Giant', 'Big', 'John', 'Studd', 'Wrestlemania', 'one', '15', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'slam', 'match', 'also', 'came', 'AWA', 'think', 'most', 'McMahon', 'idea', 'came', 'other', 'wrestling', 'organization', 'really', 'watch', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'fine', 'was', ""n't"", 'AWA', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'WWF', 'would', 'be', 'where', 'today', 'addition', 'see', 'wrestlers', 'were', 'two', 'different', 'organizations', 'also', 'instant', 'Ric', 'flair', 'was', 'wrestling', 'AWA', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'wrestling', 'World', 'Championship', 'Wrestling', 'Overall', 'give', 'picture', '10', 'weasel', 'stars', 'was', 'such', 'revelation', 'as', 'far', 'understanding', 'world', 'professional', 'wrestling', 'back', 'late', '70s', 'early', '80s']",WWE: The Spectacular Legacy of the American Wrestling Association

Perhaps its best quality is that there is the least revisionist history of all the WWE dvds.

With this one, they seemed to have let the Gagne's tell their story as they saw it as well as some other people.  I learned quite a bit watching it.  The Hogan departure and the training side of AWA were two great segments.  There was also a decent piece on the history of the various regions in existence when the AWA was created.The documentary also brought back some great AWA memories...and some bad ones too.  The main critique I have about the dvd is the fact that it wasn't released as a 3 or 4 disc set.  Instead, it's an interview dvd with some extras and a dvd full of matches.  The match selection is decent but with four decades of wrestling to choose from, there were plenty of alternatives to the matches on the disc.

He missed the boat in the 1980s and never recovered. With that said, this DVD is loaded with great matches, some not viewable anywhere else (Except the WWE Network), and the documentary itself is a who's who of old school pro wrestling. The Gagnes really did train just about everybody you've heard of from the 1970s-1990s.

1010672,A1IMPZYRB79DMS,B000H6SXW4,Movie Fan,"[40, 43]","When the WWE announced this set, I really thought they would butcher the AWA's legacy and put theirown spin on everything. To my surprise, with a few exceptions, they told the truth for a change inthis documentary and gave credit to Verne Gagne for all his accomplishments in making pro wrestlingwhat it is today.More than Vince McMahon, Verne Gagne deserves credit for making wrestling into the cultural phenomit has become, because it was Verne who paved the way for this to happen. The documentary acknowledgesVerne as wrestling's first big television star. The man had endorsement deals, appeared on the Steve AllenShow and was responsible for helping to make wrestling one of tv's first hit programs when it launched inthe 1950s. It's hard for people to imagine this today, and it did have a lot to do with the lack of stationsto choose from, but Verne's wrestling show drew a 24 rating at it's peak. A 24! I think the highest ratedRAW was a 6.2, Verne had 24 million homes a week tuning in! This was huge and it laid the foundationfor promotions to promote their product and get fans to go to the matches. All this is talked about inthe documentary and Vince gives Verne the credit.All the great characters and personalities that many young fans believe got their start in the WWF, actuallystarted in the AWA and that is finally talked about on this DVD release. Mean Gene Okerlund, Jesse Ventura,Bobby Heenan, Iron Shiek, Ricky Steamboat, Adrian Adonis, Sgt. Slaughter, Jim Brunzell, Shawn Michaels,Curt Hennig and Hulk Hogan all developed their characters in the AWA before going to the WWF. The bestpart about this DVD release is that you finally get to see this legendary footage that a lot of fans, myselfincluded, have only read about. It's really great stuff. The promos and the matches are from that oldschool mentality of pure wrestling that I miss so much with today's promotions and it's great to see itshowcased here. I only wish that they had included more. Just like with the ECW release a few years backthat was only a 2 disc set, I really think 2 discs don't do these promotions justice when you try to puttogether a retrospective collection. You need at the very least 3, with 4 discs being preferred. I mean,they gave Hogan 4 discs in his DVD set, Bret Hart and Roddy Piper 3, they can't do the same for ECWor the AWA? With that said, there is a lot here and they seemed to have selected the best matches fromthe AWA and include them in the set.Overall, the documentary was good and will really open the eyes of younger fans who think wrestlingbegins and ends with WWE, that the foundation to what we know today was really built by the AWA.Only a few complaints with the documentary. First, they seemed to repeat many things in the begining,which dragged the pace down a bit, this may have been done to stretch the documentary out, I don'tknow. There are also a few laugh out loud moments, when laughter wasn't intended. For example, whenthey talk about Hulk Hogan leaving the AWA and not keeping his commitments to wrestle some showsthat he had cut tv promos for weeks in advance and the Gagne's accuse Vince of telling Hogan NOT tokeep those commitments, Vince has the nerve to say ""he doesn't remember if he did or didn't say thatto Hogan"". Give me a break! Signing Hogan was a HUGE deal for Vince and the WWF national explosion,and he doesn't remember anything like that? I mean, the AWA was about to strike a national tv dealto bring wrestling to Saturday nights on CBS (later, Vince did this with NBC and Saturday Night's MainEvent), but when CBS saw that Verne lost Hogan, the deal was over before it began. Hogan jumpingwas huge and Vince can't remember details about it? Highly unlikely. This, along with the slow paceof the documentary at times and lack of a 3rd disc brought my rating down, but it's still a must buyfor ANYONE who claims to be a wrestling fan. Young fans raised on WWE may find it boring, but oldschool fans like myself will really enjoy it.Here's the full run down of the DVD contents..Disc One:1. AWA Documentary2. A collection of 19 stories, promos and interviews.

Because of my memories, I was looking forward to watching this DVD.First, let me start with the biggest problem....The majority of the matches included are edited!  That's right matches that theoritically should be the best matches the AWA had were edited down.  Why?  It makes no sense and was extremely disappointing when something like that isn't mentioned anywhere.  If they actually told you the matches were edited, I wouldn't have bought the set in the first place.Second problem was the documentary.  While I found the WCCW documentary was really solely about the Von Erichs, I at least enjoyed it.  There really wasn't anything great about this documentary.  It glosses over how Vince raided the AWA to create his first big set of superstars - using tatics that frankly should have landed in a lawsuit.  It glosses over what caused the decline of the AWA beyond the loss of this first flight of stars.  It just seemed to be a DVD thrown together because the WWE had this footage and wanted to use it somehow.  The fact that the AWA did have SO many of the superstars the WWE first became famous with should have made this a great story...but it fell flat.Finally, why is Ric Flair on the cover?  I know Flair spent the first 2 years of his career there...but he wasn't a superstar for the AWA.  He isn't even mentioned on the DVD except at the end when he appears in a list of names that Verne Gagne trained.  It was an obvious attempt to try to sell more DVD's using a little cheap advertising.  But there were so many stars that were great in the AWA that he really didn't need to be included.Overall, just a complete disappointment.  The WCCW documentary has a few problems but it was so much better than this one.",2,Not Good...,1304553600,"05 5, 2011",2011,1978,"['Let', 'first', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'wrestling', 'fanatic', 'have', ""n't"", 'followed', 'wrestling', 'Monday', 'Night', 'Wars', 'guess', 'was', 'feeling', 'nostalgic', 'bought', 'documentary', 'style', 'DVD', 'AWA', 'was', 'one', 'promotions', 'was', 'big', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'memories', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'DVD.First', 'let', 'start', 'biggest', 'problem', '.The', 'majority', 'matches', 'included', 'are', 'edited', 'right', 'matches', 'theoritically', 'should', 'be', 'best', 'matches', 'AWA', 'had', 'were', 'edited', 'down', 'Why', 'sense', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'when', 'something', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'anywhere', 'actually', 'told', 'matches', 'were', 'edited', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'set', 'first', 'place.Second', 'problem', 'was', 'documentary', 'found', 'WCCW', 'documentary', 'was', 'really', 'solely', 'Von', 'Erichs', 'least', 'enjoyed', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'great', 'documentary', 'how', 'Vince', 'raided', 'AWA', 'create', 'first', 'big', 'set', 'superstars', 'using', 'tatics', 'frankly', 'should', 'have', 'landed', 'lawsuit', 'what', 'caused', 'decline', 'AWA', 'loss', 'first', 'flight', 'stars', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'DVD', 'together', 'WWE', 'had', 'footage', 'wanted', 'use', 'somehow', 'fact', 'AWA', 'did', 'have', 'SO', 'many', 'superstars', 'WWE', 'first', 'became', 'famous', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'story', 'fell', 'flat.Finally', 'why', 'Ric', 'Flair', 'cover', 'know', 'Flair', 'spent', 'first', '2', 'years', 'career', 'was', ""n't"", 'superstar', 'AWA', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'end', 'when', 'list', 'names', 'Verne', 'Gagne', 'trained', 'was', 'obvious', 'attempt', 'try', 'sell', 'more', 'DVD', 'using', 'little', 'cheap', 'advertising', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'stars', 'were', 'great', 'AWA', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'included.Overall', 'just', 'complete', 'disappointment', 'WCCW', 'documentary', 'few', 'problems', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'one']",WWE: The Spectacular Legacy of the American Wrestling Association

The footage could have been a little longer and more informative. And more matches could have been added. It seems as though the WWE only wants to focus on the former AWA stars that went onto WWE and no one else. The box art should have been a warning. So once again the WWE tells a one sided story...,3,Not that good...,1164153600,"11 22, 2006",2006,428,"['WWE', 'managed', 'release', 'dud', 'DVD', 'boring', 'especially', 'beginning', 'end', 'finally', 'up', 'footage', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'longer', 'more', 'informative', 'more', 'matches', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'WWE', 'only', 'focus', 'former', 'AWA', 'stars', 'went', 'WWE', 'one', 'else', 'box', 'art', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'warning', 'So', 'once', 'again', 'WWE', 'one', 'sided', 'story']",WWE: The Spectacular Legacy of the American Wrestling Association

Gepp,"[1, 2]","While a little bit pandering to the subject (surprising, given it was put out by a major competitor who swallowed the AWA up) this was quite the comprehensive look at the AWA, one of the mainstays of professional wrestling in the 1970s. Some of the mistakes fans at the time know of were glossed over, but it did try to put both sides forward in many cases. Not a bad documentary, but it is in the matches that this disc comes into its own. Matches modern fans may not get into, but more traditional fans will love.
