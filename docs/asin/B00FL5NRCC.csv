1671974,A3G71VDPI2DFB1,B00FL5NRCC,Agnes Meo,"[0, 0]","Tanta AguaI think because this film comes from Uruguay, a country not necessarily talked about in the U.S. media, is what kept my interest  The acting was engaging and it  increased my anticipation levels while watching the characters live through a boring vacation.  It was made by two female directors and its style of filming kept me guessing as to how it will end.  I did not know what to expect from the father and daughter's relationship.  Both characters were bored in each other's company leading  me think something bad was going to happen.  Teen-aged angst when a marriage breaks up is a great subject for movie making.  However, I found this young girl's demeanor annoying throughout the entire movie.  I also did not feel good about the divorce father as he came across as a bit shady.  He was trying to pick up women throughout the vacation with his kids.  In the absence of the mother's presence, the culture dictates the father ordering the young girl to household duties?  I found that aspect unsettling.  The film was okay but I don't understand why it got so much attention in the International films festivals?  Maybe the film industry is discovering Uruguay for creative talent?  It gave me the interest to find out more about this country.",3,Uruguay - A Country in South America,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",2014,1260,"['Tanta', 'AguaI', 'think', 'film', 'Uruguay', 'country', 'not', 'necessarily', 'talked', 'U.S.', 'media', 'what', 'kept', 'interest', 'acting', 'was', 'engaging', 'increased', 'anticipation', 'levels', 'watching', 'characters', 'live', 'boring', 'vacation', 'was', 'made', 'two', 'female', 'directors', 'style', 'filming', 'kept', 'guessing', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'father', 'daughter', 'relationship', 'characters', 'were', 'bored', 'other', 'company', 'leading', 'think', 'something', 'bad', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'Teen-aged', 'angst', 'when', 'marriage', 'up', 'great', 'subject', 'movie', 'making', 'However', 'found', 'young', 'girl', 'demeanor', 'annoying', 'entire', 'movie', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'good', 'divorce', 'father', 'came', 'across', 'bit', 'shady', 'was', 'trying', 'pick', 'up', 'women', 'vacation', 'kids', 'absence', 'mother', 'presence', 'culture', 'father', 'ordering', 'young', 'girl', 'household', 'duties', 'found', 'aspect', 'unsettling', 'film', 'was', 'okay', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'International', 'films', 'festivals', 'Maybe', 'film', 'industry', 'discovering', 'Uruguay', 'creative', 'talent', 'gave', 'interest', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'country']",Tanta Agua

The entire film - save the brief opening scene - is set in Salto, the spring water capital of Uruguay.Tanta Agua (""So Much Water"") is a small,slow-moving film which depicts all too well ""that vacation"" we all experienced at one time when we were kids: crappy weather, interminable days, tetchy parents fed-up with grumpy kids, well-meaning but irritating siblings.  Divorced Dad Alberto and kids Lucia and Federico (Nestor Guzzini, Mal&uacute; Chouza and Joaqu&iacute;n Castiglioni respectively) suffer through a vacation week doused with rain.  Daughter 'Lu' is a 14-year-old hitting puberty, generally unhappy for most of the film, probably not able to explain why. Alberto, as her Dad, seems generally unlikeable at first but grows on you.  He grows on Lu, too.  At her most vulnerable, it's him that Lu turns to in her time of need.There are lots of delightful, little surprises in the Film Movement offerings.

1671976,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00FL5NRCC,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","Nearly all aspects of the plot of this movie could be discerned without knowing a word of dialog. Alberto is the divorced father of two children and the film opens with him picking them up for a family vacation at a hot springs spa. The oldest is a girl of middle school age wearing braces named Lucia, the youngest is a boy named Fede and Alberto has high hopes for some real quality time with his children. He deliberately selects a cabin that has no television so that there will be no distractions.Unfortunately, it rains heavily during the first days of their stay, forcing them to improvise to avoid boredom. Lucia is at the point where she is beginning to rebel against Alberto even though she knows that she still must rely on him. Things reach a low point until both children encounter children their own ages. Fede finds a boy to play with and they go off and do boy things like capturing frogs. Lucia first encounters a girl her age and they get along, but when a couple of cute boys are included whose attentions do not match Lucia's wishes there is tension.The situation comes to a climax when Lucia gets sick at a party and Fede falls off a bike, injuring his arm. Alberto does what he can to be the stabilizing force in both of their lives, being strict while maintaining a caring relationship. There is no form of resolution or closure at the end, the viewer ends up hoping that like nearly everyone else, they somehow manage to muddle through.The relationship between Alberto the father and Lucia is one that all fathers of female children and females over 20 will recognize. It is full of love, frustrating and challenging with the potential to explode into a dangerously unstable situation at any time. While the movie moves very slowly, the problems are fully developed, the only potential weakness is the ambiguous and uncertain ending, one that many viewers will find unsatisfactory. The end result is one that all parents understand, sometimes our best moments as a parent are responses to events that veer dramatically from the plan.",4,Moves a little slow and the ambiguous ending is one that some people will not like,1400025600,"05 14, 2014",2014,2057,"['Nearly', 'aspects', 'plot', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'discerned', 'knowing', 'word', 'dialog', 'Alberto', 'divorced', 'father', 'two', 'children', 'film', 'picking', 'up', 'family', 'vacation', 'hot', 'springs', 'spa', 'oldest', 'girl', 'middle', 'school', 'age', 'wearing', 'braces', 'named', 'Lucia', 'youngest', 'boy', 'named', 'Fede', 'Alberto', 'high', 'hopes', 'real', 'quality', 'time', 'children', 'deliberately', 'cabin', 'television', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'distractions.Unfortunately', 'heavily', 'first', 'days', 'stay', 'forcing', 'improvise', 'avoid', 'boredom', 'Lucia', 'point', 'where', 'beginning', 'rebel', 'Alberto', 'even', 'still', 'must', 'rely', 'Things', 'reach', 'low', 'point', 'children', 'encounter', 'children', 'own', 'ages', 'Fede', 'boy', 'play', 'go', 'off', 'do', 'boy', 'things', 'capturing', 'frogs', 'Lucia', 'first', 'girl', 'age', 'get', 'along', 'when', 'couple', 'cute', 'boys', 'are', 'included', 'attentions', 'do', 'not', 'match', 'Lucia', 'wishes', 'tension.The', 'situation', 'climax', 'when', 'Lucia', 'sick', 'party', 'Fede', 'bike', 'injuring', 'arm', 'Alberto', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'stabilizing', 'force', 'lives', 'being', 'strict', 'maintaining', 'caring', 'relationship', 'form', 'resolution', 'closure', 'end', 'viewer', 'up', 'hoping', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'else', 'somehow', 'manage', 'muddle', 'through.The', 'relationship', 'Alberto', 'father', 'Lucia', 'one', 'fathers', 'female', 'children', 'females', '20', 'will', 'recognize', 'full', 'love', 'frustrating', 'challenging', 'potential', 'explode', 'dangerously', 'unstable', 'situation', 'time', 'movie', 'very', 'slowly', 'problems', 'are', 'fully', 'developed', 'only', 'potential', 'weakness', 'ambiguous', 'uncertain', 'ending', 'one', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'unsatisfactory', 'end', 'result', 'one', 'parents', 'understand', 'sometimes', 'best', 'moments', 'parent', 'are', 'responses', 'events', 'veer', 'dramatically', 'plan']",Tanta Agua
1671977,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00FL5NRCC,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","The Film Movement DVD for Tanta Agua includes an amazing short film, the twelve minute Home Road Movies. That film alone is almost worth the price of admission. The main film, Tanta Agua, is long, slow, and oddly charming.Home Road Movies was a surprise. It is a son's memory of his father and their family vacations in a Peugeot 404 ""rally"" car. In twelve minutes this film packs more tender emotional moments into it than most full-length films. The film is unique, it combines still painted frames, with live action that looks painted, and full on animation. The film has a 1950's hand painted post card feel to it. I loved the style. This is a beautiful bittersweet film. I shed a tear at the end, I cared that much.Tanta Agua - So Much Water, starts off with a lot of promise. I love detailed films that force me to watch carefully. I love trying to find the subtle things the director was trying to communicate in framing, backgrounds, gestures, and dialog. The film opens with close framing and very few words. A large man is driving his car. He talks on the cell phone, saying something like, but I'm driving, have them downstairs. The hint, he's talking to his ex-wife and is taking the kids somewhere. The streets are wet, the car windows are dirty, and there is a light rain falling. While he is talking on the cell phone there is a red light to the left of his head - probably a brake light of another car. The next scene there is a shot behind the car of an intersection. There are no cars, the light is red, and the car pauses and then accelerates through the red light. The next scene the man is sitting in his car waiting for something. The kids finally appear with their mother. The kids get in the car and the father says hello. They are now off on a road trip somewhere.There isn't much dialog with the children. Clearly, Dad hasn't been around a lot and he has the kids for the weekend or a short vacation. While he drives, the rain comes down. Arriving at a resort, the rain is really coming down and they get a not so nice little cabin, number 7.In the end, only the father running the red light mattered. The director didn't do anything with all those details - things that could have elevated this film to a masterpiece. A major theme in the film is telling the truth, and doing the right thing. Unfortunately, the film takes an hour and forty minutes to tell that story. There isn't a lot of dialog. There are long stretches of boredom where nothing happens. I guess the point is, they are rained in with nothing to do at a resort that is supposed to be exciting. The film is gray - the colors, the scenery, the dialog, and the actors.I kept thinking something would happen, there would be a dramatic moment. I wished for that for the whole film. The most dramatic moment, the only time the father shows real love for his daughter, is in a grocery store. The grocery store moment is critical pivotal moment about doing the right thing. Otherwise, the two children and the father orbit in separate worlds.The film is slow to develop. There was never a payoff for those seemingly important details in the opening scenes. The film comes to an abrupt end (there is a style of European film that ends abruptly, and the director may be paying an homage to that style). I didn't hate the film, and yet I didn't love it. There was the problem; I didn't really have an emotional connection to the characters.The film is not rated. It is presented in Spanish with English subtitles. There is a lot of strong language in the subtitles. There is no nudity or violence in the film.The DVD is well worth buying or getting through Netflix for that twelve minute short. That is the prizewinner on this Film Movement disc.I was provided a review copy of the DVD.",4,Excellent Bonus Short Film,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,3770,"['Film', 'Movement', 'DVD', 'Tanta', 'Agua', 'amazing', 'short', 'film', 'twelve', 'minute', 'Home', 'Road', 'Movies', 'film', 'alone', 'almost', 'worth', 'price', 'admission', 'main', 'film', 'Tanta', 'Agua', 'long', 'slow', 'oddly', 'charming.Home', 'Road', 'Movies', 'was', 'surprise', 'son', 'memory', 'father', 'family', 'vacations', 'Peugeot', '404', 'rally', 'car', 'twelve', 'minutes', 'film', 'more', 'tender', 'emotional', 'moments', 'most', 'full-length', 'films', 'film', 'unique', 'still', 'painted', 'frames', 'live', 'action', 'painted', 'full', 'animation', 'film', '1950', 'hand', 'painted', 'post', 'card', 'feel', 'loved', 'style', 'beautiful', 'bittersweet', 'film', 'shed', 'tear', 'end', 'cared', 'much.Tanta', 'Agua', 'So', 'Much', 'Water', 'lot', 'promise', 'love', 'detailed', 'films', 'force', 'watch', 'carefully', 'love', 'trying', 'find', 'subtle', 'things', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'communicate', 'framing', 'backgrounds', 'gestures', 'dialog', 'film', 'close', 'framing', 'very', 'few', 'words', 'large', 'man', 'driving', 'car', 'cell', 'phone', 'saying', 'something', ""'m"", 'driving', 'have', 'downstairs', 'hint', 'talking', 'ex-wife', 'taking', 'kids', 'somewhere', 'streets', 'are', 'wet', 'car', 'windows', 'are', 'dirty', 'light', 'rain', 'falling', 'talking', 'cell', 'phone', 'red', 'light', 'left', 'head', 'probably', 'brake', 'light', 'car', 'next', 'scene', 'shot', 'car', 'intersection', 'are', 'cars', 'light', 'red', 'car', 'pauses', 'then', 'red', 'light', 'next', 'scene', 'man', 'sitting', 'car', 'waiting', 'something', 'kids', 'finally', 'appear', 'mother', 'kids', 'get', 'car', 'father', 'hello', 'are', 'now', 'road', 'trip', 'somewhere.There', ""n't"", 'much', 'dialog', 'children', 'Clearly', 'Dad', ""n't"", 'been', 'lot', 'kids', 'weekend', 'short', 'vacation', 'rain', 'down', 'Arriving', 'resort', 'rain', 'really', 'coming', 'down', 'get', 'not', 'nice', 'little', 'cabin', 'number', '7.In', 'end', 'only', 'father', 'running', 'red', 'light', 'mattered', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'details', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'elevated', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'major', 'theme', 'film', 'telling', 'truth', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'tell', 'story', ""n't"", 'lot', 'dialog', 'are', 'long', 'stretches', 'boredom', 'where', 'nothing', 'guess', 'point', 'are', 'rained', 'nothing', 'do', 'resort', 'supposed', 'be', 'exciting', 'film', 'gray', 'colors', 'scenery', 'dialog', 'actors.I', 'kept', 'thinking', 'something', 'would', 'happen', 'would', 'be', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'wished', 'whole', 'film', 'most', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'only', 'time', 'father', 'real', 'love', 'daughter', 'grocery', 'store', 'grocery', 'store', 'moment', 'critical', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'Otherwise', 'two', 'children', 'father', 'orbit', 'separate', 'worlds.The', 'film', 'slow', 'develop', 'was', 'never', 'payoff', 'seemingly', 'important', 'details', 'opening', 'scenes', 'film', 'abrupt', 'end', 'style', 'European', 'film', 'abruptly', 'director', 'may', 'be', 'paying', 'homage', 'style', 'did', ""n't"", 'hate', 'film', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'was', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'emotional', 'connection', 'characters.The', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'presented', 'Spanish', 'English', 'subtitles', 'lot', 'strong', 'language', 'subtitles', 'nudity', 'violence', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'well', 'worth', 'buying', 'getting', 'Netflix', 'twelve', 'minute', 'short', 'prizewinner', 'Film', 'Movement', 'disc.I', 'was', 'provided', 'review', 'copy', 'DVD']",Tanta Agua
1671978,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00FL5NRCC,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Writers/directors Ana Guevara and Leticia Jorge have captured that sense of parent/child schism that comes form distance following separation. The film from Uruguay is aptly titled TANTA AGUA (`So Much Water') manages to provide that claustrophobic feeling (rain prevents excursions outside a living space in a little vacation that is supposed to allow a renewed coming together between a father and children): it is a cinematic trick that works.Alberto (N&eacute;stor Guzzini) is divorced and arranges to pick up his tow children form their mother to take them on vacation to a thermal resort in Salto. His children are teenager Luc&iacute;a (Mal&uacute; Chouza) and 10-year old Federico (Joaqu&iacute;n Castiglioni) who are unsure they wish to spend the time with their estranged father. Constant rain compounds the problem of togetherness, as there is nowhere to go or nothing to do because of the confining rain. No swimming pool, no television - only Alberto who solos his attempt to entertain the two children unsuccessfully. But the proximity examines the schisms that have occurred and the boredom becomes ennui. Luc&iacute;a is entering adolescence and by nature doubts her father has any clue as to how she perceives the world, especially when Luc&iacute;a discovers a boy in the resort who stirs her nascent sexuality. The film is a coming of age story for both Luc&iacute;a and to some less defined extent for Frederico, but in the end the frustration Alberto feels as he attempts to reignite his fatherly role with his children he no longer understands is what make the film worthy.This is a small film, rich in suggestion, perhaps a bit slow in execution, but well worth examining how South American families deal with dysfunction.

The slow pace and general boredom of the characters might be off-putting for some, but I loved that the directors chose a single setting and a situation where the characters are forced to stay together because it allowed for a deeper, richer investigation of the relationship between the children and the estranged father.

Apparently he doesn't get to spend much time with his children and he's determined not to let anything ruin the trip.Unfortunately, the hot springs resort he's picked for their vacation spot is rained out, and neither Lu nor Fed are all that excited about the trip anyway.  There's no television and not much of anything to do.  Lu meets some people of her own age, including a couple of boys, and she stages an act of mild adolescent rebellion by joining them for a dance party.  At the party Lu realizes she's not quite as grown up as she thinks she is, and the result is some nice father/daughter time. In the end when the vacation's over father and children all realize they've had a nice time in spite of all the difficulties.So this is a pleasant little film about growing up, or at least making an effort to grow up, and about changing family dynamics.

1671981,A2EMIIHBL60K7L,B00FL5NRCC,Luanne Ollivier,"[0, 0]","Tanta Agua is the first feature film of writing and directing duo Ana Guevara and Leticia Jorge. It was a winner at the Miami and Guadalajara Film Festivals.Divorced father Alberto Nestor Guzzini) takes his children Lucia (Mal&uacute; Chouza) and Federico (Joaqu&iacute;n Castiglioni)to Salto, the spring water capital of Uruguay, for a vacation together. They leave in the pouring rain, arrive in the pouring rain and it continues for the first few days of their trip. (Tanta Agua translates as too much water)Tanta Agua is in Spanish with English subtitles, but even without the subtitles, you would be able to read Lucia's unhappiness a mile away. She doesn't want to be there. Her father's attempts to engage, to have fun and to spend time together are either tolerated or rebuffed. She seems determined not to enjoy herself. Federico seems to go along with his sister's mood much of the time. The rain does eventually let up and every member of the family finds someone outside of their family to spend time with.Guevara and Jorge give us a poignant look at father/child relationships that rings so true. The dedication of the film is to the director's fathers, leading me to wonder if Lucia's character had a bit of their own lives mixed in. It was interesting to watch this film as a parent. Alberto never stops trying to reach Lucia and the most moving moments of the film are when they finally share something. And Lucia laughs and smiles. It is a marked difference from the countenance she presents most of the film. Alberto's demeanor changes as well with that small offering.The sound of the rain constantly falling was used effectively and underscored the damper the weather and the children's attitude has brought to this vacation. I though all three actors were wonderful, natural and realistic, Tanta Agua is a sweet little film about family and relationships. The pacing is slower and that may frustrate some viewers. I actually thought it mirrored real life very well.The bonus film that is always included with Film Movement releases was a great tie in.

1671982,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00FL5NRCC,Paul Allaer,"[3, 4]","As a fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies, I subscribe to their DVD-of-the-Month Club, and this is the November '13 release (it will be available to the public at large in 2014).&#34;Tanta Agua&#34; (2013 release from Uruguay; English title &#34;So Much Water&#34;; 102 min.) brings the story of Alberto, a divorced guy, who takes his 2 kids, 14 yr. old Lucia (&#34;Lu&#34;) and 10 yr. old Federico &#34;Fede&#34;) on a week-long vacation near Salto, the &#34;spring water capital of Uruguay&#34;, for what seems to be some much needed &#34;bonding&#34; and &#34;quality&#34; time with his kids (they live with their mom). Immediately from the start of the movie, it rains, actually it pours down relentlessly, making the long drive from Montevideo to Salto even more boring than it already is. They settle in their cabin, but the weather makes it impossible to go swimming and difficult to do much of anything outside. Eventually the kids get to know and befriend other vacationers, while Alberto has his eyes on a local receptionist for a possible fling. Will the three of them become closer as the weeks moves along? Or will the vacation simply confirm that the kids are emotionally miles apart from their dad, and unable to bridge the gap? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: while nominally the movie is about a divorced father and his 2 kids, the bulk of the movie focuses on the relationship between Alberto and Lu, a 14 yr. old who is at her most awkward puberty stage, and has trouble fitting in, be it in her relationship with her dad, or in her relationships with others boys and girls her age. The role of Lu is played by Malu Chouza, who pulls off a brilliant performance. She is at times sullen, deceitful, vulnerable, happy, and/or moody, sometimes all of that in the span of just minutes. Apart from the character studies, the movie also provides a fascinating glimpse of what life is like in Uruguay outside of its capital Montevideo. Makes me want to visit it. The movie is directed by 2 women, Ana Guevara and  Leticia Jorge, and as the movie opens we are informed that they dedicate this &#34; a nuestros padres&#34;, and that about sums it up.As always, there is a bonus shortie, and this month we get a UK shortie, the delightful 12 min. &#34;Home Road Movies&#34;, about a father desperately trying to have the 'perfect' family vacation. Just watch!Bottom line, if you are in the mood for a top-notch quality foreign film that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. &#34;Tanta Agua&#34; is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,"Tender father-daughter relationship movie, dedicated ""to our fathers"".",1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,2692,"['fan', 'Film', 'Movement', 'library', 'foreign', 'indie', 'movies', 'subscribe', 'DVD-of-the-Month', 'Club', 'November', ""'13"", 'release', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'public', 'large', '2014', '34', 'Tanta', 'Agua', '34', '2013', 'release', 'Uruguay', 'English', 'title', '34', 'So', 'Much', 'Water', '34', '102', 'min', 'story', 'Alberto', 'divorced', 'guy', 'who', '2', 'kids', '14', 'yr.', 'old', 'Lucia', '34', 'Lu', '34', '10', 'yr.', 'old', 'Federico', '34', 'Fede', '34', 'week-long', 'vacation', 'Salto', '34', 'spring', 'water', 'capital', 'Uruguay', '34', 'what', 'be', 'much', 'needed', '34', 'bonding', '34', '34', 'quality', '34', 'time', 'kids', 'live', 'mom', 'Immediately', 'start', 'movie', 'actually', 'down', 'relentlessly', 'making', 'long', 'drive', 'Montevideo', 'Salto', 'even', 'more', 'boring', 'already', 'settle', 'cabin', 'weather', 'impossible', 'go', 'swimming', 'difficult', 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'outside', 'Eventually', 'kids', 'get', 'know', 'befriend', 'other', 'vacationers', 'Alberto', 'eyes', 'local', 'receptionist', 'possible', 'fling', 'Will', 'three', 'become', 'closer', 'weeks', 'along', 'will', 'vacation', 'simply', 'kids', 'are', 'emotionally', 'miles', 'apart', 'dad', 'unable', 'bridge', 'gap', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', 'nominally', 'movie', 'divorced', 'father', '2', 'kids', 'bulk', 'movie', 'relationship', 'Alberto', 'Lu', '14', 'yr.', 'old', 'who', 'most', 'awkward', 'puberty', 'stage', 'trouble', 'fitting', 'be', 'relationship', 'dad', 'relationships', 'others', 'boys', 'girls', 'age', 'role', 'Lu', 'played', 'Malu', 'Chouza', 'who', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'times', 'sullen', 'deceitful', 'vulnerable', 'happy', 'and/or', 'moody', 'sometimes', 'span', 'just', 'minutes', 'Apart', 'character', 'studies', 'movie', 'also', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'what', 'life', 'Uruguay', 'capital', 'Montevideo', 'Makes', 'want', 'visit', 'movie', 'directed', '2', 'women', 'Ana', 'Guevara', 'Leticia', 'Jorge', 'movie', 'are', 'informed', 'dedicate', '34', 'nuestros', 'padres', '34', 'about', 'sums', 'up.As', 'always', 'bonus', 'shortie', 'month', 'get', 'UK', 'shortie', 'delightful', '12', 'min', '34', 'Home', 'Road', 'Movies', '34', 'father', 'desperately', 'trying', 'have', ""'perfect"", 'family', 'vacation', 'Just', 'watch', 'Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'mood', 'top-notch', 'quality', 'foreign', 'film', 'miles', 'away', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', '34', 'Tanta', 'Agua', '34', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",Tanta Agua
