1666639,AICC1R30KLRU8,B00ECGIL9K,Anthony Trimarchi,"[6, 6]","Home Alone 5: The Holiday Heist (2012). I have seen Home Alone 1, 2, and 3 when they were originally released at the movie theaters. I have also read the novelization of Home Alone 1 and 2 back in 1990/1992. All three films were great, and I always enjoyed the plots of Home Alone 1-3. However the 4th installment from 2002 was a complete total embarrassment. Home Alone (5): The Holiday Heist released in 2012 (as straight-to-TV) goes back to its roots a little bit, and is pretty good (although not great). It's obvious by the quality that this film was made for television, but it's still not half bad. I'll admit the acting by the parents are a little over-the-top at times, and this film is nothing in comparison to the first Home Alone (1990) film. Yet, this film still isn't bad or stupid. Malcolm McDowell, best known from the films ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) and ""Time after Time"" (1979), perfectly plays the main villain in this film, and like Joe Pesci from ""Home Alone 1"", is actually an intelligent villian. The other two villains are a little silly/dimwitted - the producers could of casted much better in that area. Home Alone 5: The Holiday Heist seems to copy the plots of Home Alone (1990) and Home Alone 3 (1997). I don't want to give away spoilers, but If you (recently) seen both Home Alone 1 and 3, you'll understand what I mean. This film is almost like a remake of sorts; mixing the plots of Home 1 and 3 into one film. It's the type of movie to watch on a rainy day, or while putting up the Christmas tree, or when it's on television. It doesn't have the funny laughs that Home 1 and 2 had or even Home Alone 3. This film is nice, enjoyable, but at the same time doesn't hold up to Home Alone 1-3. But, I don't believe any sequels or spinoffs can hold up to the first film. I would recommend watching this film if it's on television, but I can not recommend buying this film on DVD, unless it's one of those barging bin $5.00 prices. I give this film four out of five stars. Two stars for the film at least trying to return back to the original formats of Home 1 & 3.",4,Home Alone 5: The Holiday Heist,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,2093,"['Home', 'Alone', '5', 'Holiday', 'Heist', '2012', 'have', 'seen', 'Home', 'Alone', '1', '2', '3', 'when', 'were', 'originally', 'released', 'movie', 'theaters', 'have', 'also', 'read', 'novelization', 'Home', 'Alone', '1', '2', 'back', '1990/1992', 'three', 'films', 'were', 'great', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'plots', 'Home', 'Alone', '1-3', 'However', '4th', 'installment', '2002', 'was', 'complete', 'total', 'embarrassment', 'Home', 'Alone', '5', 'Holiday', 'Heist', 'released', '2012', 'straight-to-TV', 'back', 'roots', 'little', 'bit', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'obvious', 'quality', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'still', 'not', 'half', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'acting', 'parents', 'are', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'times', 'film', 'nothing', 'comparison', 'first', 'Home', 'Alone', '1990', 'film', 'film', 'still', ""n't"", 'bad', 'stupid', 'Malcolm', 'McDowell', 'best', 'known', 'films', 'A', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', '1971', 'Time', 'Time', '1979', 'perfectly', 'main', 'villain', 'film', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Home', 'Alone', '1', 'actually', 'intelligent', 'villian', 'other', 'two', 'villains', 'are', 'little', 'silly/dimwitted', 'producers', 'could', 'casted', 'much', 'better', 'area', 'Home', 'Alone', '5', 'Holiday', 'Heist', 'copy', 'plots', 'Home', 'Alone', '1990', 'Home', 'Alone', '3', '1997', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'recently', 'seen', 'Home', 'Alone', '1', '3', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'mean', 'film', 'almost', 'remake', 'sorts', 'mixing', 'plots', 'Home', '1', '3', 'one', 'film', 'type', 'movie', 'watch', 'rainy', 'day', 'putting', 'up', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'when', 'television', ""n't"", 'have', 'funny', 'Home', '1', '2', 'had', 'even', 'Home', 'Alone', '3', 'film', 'nice', 'enjoyable', 'same', 'time', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'Home', 'Alone', '1-3', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'sequels', 'spinoffs', 'can', 'hold', 'up', 'first', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'television', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'buying', 'film', 'DVD', 'one', 'barging', 'bin', '5.00', 'prices', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'Two', 'stars', 'film', 'least', 'trying', 'return', 'back', 'original', 'formats', 'Home', '1', '3']",Home Alone: The Holiday Heist

I think it still gives a good message in the world we live in today.  We can think about it, Home Alone is an early '90s movie before we had all this technology we have today.  The original Home Alone doesn't even show a cellphone.  Basically, the only electronic way Kevin was entertaining himself was by watching TV or movies.  We don't see him playing on a computer or video games.  It also came out long before Iphones, so even the teens had different ways of communicating and entertaining themselves back then.We remember Home Alone films mostly for their slapstick humor where a kid takes down burglars.  They normally give a family message.  It's obvious the moral of this Home Alone.  In this digital age we live in, a lot of people are just not getting out into the world enough and so used to playing online games or using their phones as technology to text and look at messages from friends.  It's cool and sad to think of what the world has come to since the first home alone came out, and we might wish to go back to the older days when this wasn't so much the case.  It's obvious that the producers of this film probably expecting mostly kids to watch it, not only intended to have a holiday season movie, but intended to give a message to kids how they should put away their technology from time to time, and live in the real world, do things with their family and friends outside.  So, I have to say I'll give this film a 3/5.  I think it's getting annoying how many Home Alones have been made since the original, just because they have slapstick humor.  But, I appreciate the message they gave, it works so well in today's world.
