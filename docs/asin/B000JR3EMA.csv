1029097,A2VP5OOKKLLCPV,B000JR3EMA,"Julie Vognar ""Julie""","[11, 13]","Dirk Bogarde does an excellent job in portraying a once-Hungarian, now German, who inherited a chocolate factory (do NOT think Willy Wonka!)from his father-in law. It's the early '30s; times are getting harder and harder. He's married to a perhaps attractive to him at one time (but not to him anymore--if ever) vapid German Jew, and is intelligent enough to see that--times will get even worse. He hates his life, increasingly, and more and more--stands apart from it (at the beginning of the film, while he is making love to his wife, he sees himself sitting against the wall of the room, observing the operation). He seems to relate to no one, and perhaps doesn't know how to, or even want to. Gradually, he sinks into insanity. He thinks he has hatched a scheme to make a ""killing,""--but he hasn't. He mearly kills.The film is so dark, and angular, and (occasionally) arty, that only Bogarde's acting (the rest of the cast is good, too) makes it really worth owning--but it should be seen, for that reason alone. As often with depictions of the insane, one is occasionally confused as to what is really happening, and what the protagonist THINKS is happening.It's a very cold movie, and there's nothing to laugh at. For instance: early in the film, the protagonist has travelled some distance to do business with another chocolate manufacturer--and, for some reason, starts telling him a little about his life. He mentions his wife's dowrey--her weight in gold coin. ""Upon examination,"" he says coldly, scornfully, despairingly, ""the gold coins proved to be chocolate."" Ordinarily, this line might evoke laughter, but because of the way he says it, it doesn't.There is nothing to love. The sub-title (""A Journey into Light"") is almost diametrically opposed to the truth of the story.My VHS tape played perfectly, with no halts, fading, or extraneous background noises.",4,"Wouldn't ""Insanity"" be a better name?...Perhaps not.",1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,1872,"['Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'once-Hungarian', 'now', 'German', 'who', 'inherited', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'do', 'NOT', 'think', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'father-in', 'law', 'early', ""'30s"", 'times', 'are', 'getting', 'harder', 'harder', 'married', 'perhaps', 'attractive', 'one', 'time', 'not', 'anymore', 'ever', 'vapid', 'German', 'Jew', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'see', 'times', 'will', 'get', 'even', 'worse', 'life', 'increasingly', 'more', 'more', 'apart', 'beginning', 'film', 'making', 'love', 'wife', 'sitting', 'wall', 'room', 'observing', 'operation', 'relate', 'one', 'perhaps', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'even', 'want', 'Gradually', 'insanity', 'hatched', 'scheme', 'make', 'killing', ""n't"", 'mearly', 'kills.The', 'film', 'so', 'dark', 'angular', 'occasionally', 'arty', 'only', 'Bogarde', 'acting', 'rest', 'cast', 'good', 'too', 'really', 'worth', 'owning', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'reason', 'alone', 'often', 'depictions', 'insane', 'one', 'occasionally', 'confused', 'what', 'really', 'happening', 'what', 'protagonist', 'THINKS', 'very', 'cold', 'movie', 'nothing', 'laugh', 'instance', 'early', 'film', 'protagonist', 'travelled', 'distance', 'do', 'business', 'chocolate', 'manufacturer', 'reason', 'telling', 'little', 'life', 'wife', 'dowrey', 'weight', 'gold', 'coin', 'examination', 'coldly', 'scornfully', 'despairingly', 'gold', 'proved', 'be', 'chocolate', 'Ordinarily', 'line', 'might', 'evoke', 'laughter', 'way', 'nothing', 'love', 'sub-title', 'Journey', 'Light', 'almost', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'truth', 'story.My', 'VHS', 'tape', 'played', 'perfectly', 'halts', 'fading', 'extraneous', 'background', 'noises']",Despair (Eine Reise ins Licht)
1029098,A3GXQCKMPVGRIF,B000JR3EMA,"Matthew H. Janovic ""Pre-Socratically!""","[2, 2]","This was a stopover film for Werner Rainer Fassbinder in 1978 before he'd have his international hit with The Marriage of Maria Braun. Despair was his first real attempts at depicting Weimar Germany as a director (he'd produced & done a cameo in Ulli Lommel's The Tenderness of Wolves in 1973 about the serial child killer Peter K&uuml;rten) and is based on an early novel by Vladimir Nabokov, adapted by the great playwright Tom Stoppard who's best known for Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are Dead. (He also went on to co-author the screenplay for Terry Gilliam's Brazil)This is a tale of false doubles and one more example of Nabokov's use of the &#34;unreliable narrator,&#34; a theme he was apparently fond of, but then, what's not to like about watching annoyingly delusional people undoing themselves? There are many changes to the source story here in Fassbinder and Stoppard's version making it utterly unique and something that could only be a Fassbinder film about the doomed. Placing it around the era it was written and published could only emphasize the descent into--yes--despair and madness that's typical of many of the characters in his oeuvre. But this time around, I don't think Fassbinder empathized very much with the character, which is fine, he doesn't need to. Herman's a Russian emigre with a shadowy past in Berlin (in Nabokov's novel it's Prague) who's made it rich as a chocolate confectioner with a rapidly failing business thanks to the Depression, is married to a seemingly amnesiac but bubbly wife who might be cheating on him with her &#34;cousin,&#34; and is rapidly losing his mind, all in the midst of the rise of National Socialism. The atmosphere is of a kind of giddy slide into madness with some very dark undertones. Herman wants to escape his life and finds his &#34;doppleganger,&#34; his twin--only the tramp, the bum he runs into in a park (played by the late & great Fassbinder player Klaus L&ouml;witsch), concocts a plot to fake his death by killing the transient bum who looks nothing like him to create the &#34;ultimate crime,&#34; and so on, you know where it's headed, this is Fassbinder, a great film, but not for everyone.I noticed that DVD Beaver wasn't entirely pleased with the transfer to this, which makes no sense: this is one of the sharpest, finest transfers I've ever seen of a Fassbinder film or even many others on Blu-ray. They might want to get their eyes checked here, because it's one of the best restorations to come along outside of Citizen Kane or any other number of classics. The bitrate averages very high and the audio, while original mono, is very high resolution, so I don't know how they got the impression that Olive Films didn't do their best here, they did. Normally, they don't include any extras, but here we get an extraordinary documentary on the making of the film that includes interview footage with Fassbinder that I don't think anyone in the viewing public's seen, maybe ever. Olive also seems to have sprung part of the money for the restoration of the film with Bavaria Media, the original producers of the film, and the Fassbinder Foundation. Not a lot of films look this good in HD, so I don't understand what the criticisms are about, they make no sense.",5,It doesn't get much better than this with Fassbinder,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,3248,"['was', 'stopover', 'film', 'Werner', 'Rainer', 'Fassbinder', '1978', ""'d"", 'have', 'international', 'hit', 'Marriage', 'Maria', 'Braun', 'Despair', 'was', 'first', 'real', 'attempts', 'depicting', 'Weimar', 'Germany', 'director', ""'d"", 'produced', 'done', 'cameo', 'Ulli', 'Lommel', 'Tenderness', 'Wolves', '1973', 'serial', 'child', 'killer', 'Peter', 'K', 'uuml', 'rten', 'based', 'early', 'novel', 'Vladimir', 'Nabokov', 'adapted', 'great', 'playwright', 'Tom', 'Stoppard', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'Rosencrantz', 'Guildenstern', 'are', 'Dead', 'also', 'went', 'co-author', 'screenplay', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Brazil', 'tale', 'false', 'doubles', 'one', 'more', 'example', 'Nabokov', 'use', '34', 'unreliable', 'narrator', '34', 'theme', 'was', 'apparently', 'fond', 'then', 'what', 'not', 'like', 'watching', 'annoyingly', 'delusional', 'people', 'undoing', 'are', 'many', 'changes', 'source', 'story', 'here', 'Fassbinder', 'Stoppard', 'version', 'making', 'utterly', 'unique', 'something', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'Fassbinder', 'film', 'doomed', 'Placing', 'era', 'was', 'written', 'published', 'could', 'only', 'emphasize', 'descent', 'yes', 'despair', 'madness', 'typical', 'many', 'characters', 'oeuvre', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Fassbinder', 'empathized', 'very', 'much', 'character', 'fine', ""n't"", 'need', 'Herman', 'Russian', 'emigre', 'shadowy', 'past', 'Berlin', 'Nabokov', 'novel', 'Prague', 'who', 'made', 'rich', 'chocolate', 'confectioner', 'rapidly', 'failing', 'business', 'thanks', 'Depression', 'married', 'seemingly', 'amnesiac', 'bubbly', 'wife', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'cheating', '34', 'cousin', '34', 'rapidly', 'losing', 'mind', 'midst', 'rise', 'National', 'Socialism', 'atmosphere', 'kind', 'giddy', 'slide', 'madness', 'very', 'dark', 'undertones', 'Herman', 'escape', 'life', '34', 'doppleganger', '34', 'twin', 'only', 'tramp', 'bum', 'park', 'played', 'late', 'great', 'Fassbinder', 'player', 'Klaus', 'L', 'ouml', 'witsch', 'plot', 'fake', 'death', 'killing', 'transient', 'bum', 'who', 'nothing', 'create', '34', 'ultimate', 'crime', '34', 'so', 'know', 'where', 'headed', 'Fassbinder', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'everyone.I', 'noticed', 'DVD', 'Beaver', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'pleased', 'transfer', 'sense', 'one', 'sharpest', 'finest', 'transfers', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Fassbinder', 'film', 'even', 'many', 'others', 'Blu-ray', 'might', 'want', 'get', 'eyes', 'checked', 'here', 'one', 'best', 'restorations', 'come', 'outside', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'other', 'number', 'classics', 'bitrate', 'averages', 'very', 'high', 'audio', 'original', 'mono', 'very', 'high', 'resolution', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'got', 'impression', 'Olive', 'Films', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'best', 'here', 'did', 'Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'include', 'extras', 'here', 'get', 'extraordinary', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'interview', 'footage', 'Fassbinder', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'viewing', 'public', 'seen', 'maybe', 'ever', 'Olive', 'also', 'have', 'sprung', 'part', 'money', 'restoration', 'film', 'Bavaria', 'Media', 'original', 'producers', 'film', 'Fassbinder', 'Foundation', 'Not', 'lot', 'films', 'look', 'good', 'HD', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'criticisms', 'are', 'make', 'sense']",Despair (Eine Reise ins Licht)
