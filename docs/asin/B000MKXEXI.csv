1046752,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000MKXEXI,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[20, 20]","In Living Room Yoga, instructor Eva Barash offers a down-to-earth yoga practice set--where else?--right in her living room (well, in someone's living room, this one being quite modern, with chrome furniture and a flat-screen TV).  She describes her 45-minute yoga practice as being ""not for beginners,"" as some of the poses are a bit more challenging, and she does not provide a lot of detailed form instruction.  However, a separate section of the DVD, titled ""The Library,"" offers almost 30 minutes of more detailed breakdowns for many individual postures.  THe Main DVD menu includes the following options:  Play All-Introduction-The Workout-The Library.  There are also bonus materials, including ""Getting the Most Out of Your Living Room"" (see below), and a 6-minute interview with Eva.As mentioned above, main yoga workout is about 45 minutes long, with Eva teaching live in a casual, laid-back manner (although surprisingly, she mostly uses Sanskrit names for the postures).  The practice begins seated on the floor for some opening poses, including down dog and locust, with Eva's sequencing continuing to be non-traditional throughout.  She does then move on to sun salutations, completing 10 total rounds:  4 modified, 4 full, and 2 with breathing only (no instruction).  Following this, Eva performs some standing side stretches and then moves to the floor to lie briefly in relaxation pose and to perform a reclined twist.  A standing series is next, starting with warrior 1 to warrior 2 to wide angle forward bend then side angle, triangle, and another standing forward bend.  Next the difficulty level increases a bit with side angle and half moon postures, and then Eva finishes the standing work with dancer's pose.  Moving to face-down on the floor, Eva performs half bow before moving on to full bow pose.  She does a simple straight leg seated twist before proceeding to some abs work in the form of single and then double knee hugs.  Bridge pose follows, adding a block under the sacrum for a supported inversion, and then the practice finishes with a brief savasana.The Making the Most of Your Living Room segment is a shorter (12 minutes) stretching program that uses a couch for most of the exercises.  Seated on the couch, Eva performs modified fish, seated twist, seated forward bend, and wide-leg seated forward bend.  She then stands behind the couch for modified down dog, single leg lift, modified push-ups, and tadasana.  Moving back to seated, she does a seated backbend over the arm rest and then lies on the floor with her calves resting on the couch to finish.This DVD would be best suited for those looking for a very down-to-earth, straightforward yoga practice which is more focused on the stretching than the spiritual aspects of yoga (in fact, the DVD case calls the practice a blend of core strength and ""yoga calisthenics"").  I'd say that it is appropriate for advanced beginners who have a solid foundation in yoga but are ready to experiment with a few slightly more difficult postures such as half moon and dancer's pose.  The bonus workout is intended as a means to de-stress without even having to change into your workout clothes, and it's certainly a nice addition for those short on time.  Overall a solid DVD that is likely to appeal to many casual yoga practitioners.",4,A down-to-earth yoga practice,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,3318,"['Living', 'Room', 'Yoga', 'instructor', 'Eva', 'Barash', 'down-to-earth', 'yoga', 'practice', 'set', 'where', 'else', 'right', 'living', 'room', 'well', 'someone', 'living', 'room', 'one', 'being', 'quite', 'modern', 'chrome', 'furniture', 'flat-screen', 'TV', '45-minute', 'yoga', 'practice', 'being', 'not', 'beginners', 'poses', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'challenging', 'not', 'provide', 'lot', 'detailed', 'form', 'instruction', 'However', 'separate', 'section', 'DVD', 'titled', 'Library', 'almost', '30', 'minutes', 'more', 'detailed', 'breakdowns', 'many', 'individual', 'postures', 'THe', 'Main', 'DVD', 'menu', 'following', 'options', 'Play', 'All-Introduction-The', 'Workout-The', 'Library', 'are', 'also', 'bonus', 'materials', 'including', 'Getting', 'Most', 'Your', 'Living', 'Room', 'see', '6-minute', 'interview', 'Eva.As', 'mentioned', 'main', 'yoga', 'workout', '45', 'minutes', 'long', 'Eva', 'teaching', 'live', 'casual', 'laid-back', 'manner', 'surprisingly', 'mostly', 'Sanskrit', 'names', 'postures', 'practice', 'seated', 'floor', 'opening', 'poses', 'including', 'down', 'dog', 'locust', 'Eva', 'sequencing', 'continuing', 'be', 'non-traditional', 'then', 'move', 'sun', 'salutations', 'completing', '10', 'total', 'rounds', '4', 'modified', '4', 'full', '2', 'breathing', 'only', 'instruction', 'Following', 'Eva', 'standing', 'side', 'stretches', 'then', 'moves', 'floor', 'lie', 'briefly', 'relaxation', 'pose', 'perform', 'reclined', 'twist', 'standing', 'series', 'next', 'starting', 'warrior', '1', 'warrior', '2', 'wide', 'angle', 'forward', 'bend', 'then', 'side', 'angle', 'triangle', 'standing', 'forward', 'bend', 'difficulty', 'level', 'bit', 'side', 'angle', 'half', 'moon', 'postures', 'then', 'Eva', 'standing', 'work', 'dancer', 'pose', 'Moving', 'face-down', 'floor', 'Eva', 'half', 'bow', 'moving', 'full', 'bow', 'pose', 'simple', 'straight', 'leg', 'seated', 'twist', 'proceeding', 'abs', 'work', 'form', 'single', 'then', 'double', 'knee', 'hugs', 'Bridge', 'pose', 'adding', 'block', 'sacrum', 'supported', 'inversion', 'then', 'practice', 'finishes', 'brief', 'savasana.The', 'Making', 'Most', 'Your', 'Living', 'Room', 'segment', 'shorter', '12', 'minutes', 'stretching', 'program', 'couch', 'most', 'exercises', 'Seated', 'couch', 'Eva', 'modified', 'fish', 'seated', 'twist', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'wide-leg', 'seated', 'forward', 'bend', 'then', 'couch', 'modified', 'dog', 'single', 'leg', 'lift', 'modified', 'push-ups', 'tadasana', 'Moving', 'back', 'seated', 'seated', 'backbend', 'arm', 'rest', 'then', 'floor', 'calves', 'resting', 'couch', 'finish.This', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'suited', 'looking', 'very', 'down-to-earth', 'straightforward', 'yoga', 'practice', 'more', 'focused', 'stretching', 'spiritual', 'aspects', 'yoga', 'fact', 'DVD', 'case', 'practice', 'blend', 'core', 'strength', 'yoga', 'calisthenics', ""'d"", 'say', 'appropriate', 'advanced', 'beginners', 'who', 'have', 'solid', 'foundation', 'yoga', 'are', 'ready', 'experiment', 'few', 'slightly', 'more', 'difficult', 'postures', 'such', 'half', 'moon', 'dancer', 'pose', 'bonus', 'workout', 'intended', 'de-stress', 'even', 'having', 'change', 'workout', 'clothes', 'certainly', 'nice', 'addition', 'short', 'time', 'Overall', 'solid', 'DVD', 'likely', 'appeal', 'many', 'casual', 'yoga', 'practitioners']",Living Room Yoga: Strengthen And Lengthen
1046753,A35ROK8CVWNF62,B000MKXEXI,"Buggy ""SUNNIE Day reader""","[3, 3]","LIVING ROOM YOGA it's a great practice that I'm glad I discovered. I wasn't really expecting much because I'd never heard of this instructor and there are some minor audio problems in the beginning sequence however don't let that detour you Eva Barash is fantastic; her friendly laid back manner and live (not dubbed over) voice instruction makes you feel as if you're working out with one of your fun, energetic girlfriends in the comfort of your own living room. Eva is down to earth, encouraging, relatable and best of all happy giving us a balanced and somewhat challenging advanced-beginners workout. I've been using this for several months now and Eva always feels like a breath of fresh air and leaves me smiling.Using Sanskrit and English pose names we begin our 45 minute practice in yes a living room; with some seated opening poses (Down dog, Locust) before performing 10 rounds of basic Sun salutations, moving onto Standing side stretches, a brief relaxation and Reclined twist. We move onto a 20 minute standing series which includes Warriors 1 & 2, Wide angle foreword bend, Side angle, Triangle, and Half moon finishing back on the floor with Half and Full Bow, Seated twist, Bridge and yoga sit ups concluding with a brief yet lovely savasana.There is not a lot of detailed instruction provided here however the practice flows well and is easy to follow providing you have a basic knowledge of the poses. For beginners I recommend the bonus feature called ""the library"" which gives a 30 minute detailed breakdown of the poses. Also included in the bonus features is a short interview with Eva and ""making the most out of your living room"" which is a 12 minute stretching program  incorporating a couch into the exercises.I really enjoyed this delightful, fresh Yoga practice and highly recommend it.

1046754,A12CB5VR68K5T1,B000MKXEXI,Caravaggio38,"[7, 7]","This is by far the most accessible and friendly yoga DVD I have come across.  While I love to practice with beautiful beaches on screen, I found this DVD very refreshing.  I was immediately struck by the sense of familiarity, fun and humility of the video.  She was doing it in a living room!  You know Eva did not spend a lot to produce the video, but her sincerety, humility and sense of joy come through, and that makes her practice more enticing.(1) Eva is so accessible - You can understand her and relate to her. Her explanations are simple and friendly. She tells you what to expect so you don't wonder in the middle of a pose whether you should be moving on to the next one. Even if you are a beginner, you will not be overwhelmed.  She looks like an ordinary person (I don't mean this in a dismissive way but as a complement), who does not do ""perfect"" poses.  Just watch when she transitions from upward facing dog to downward facing dog - she does it the way I and many other ordinary practitioners do.(2) She seems to enjoy what she is doing. I rarely see yogis on DVD smile while practicing. In fact, I'm now trying to think of one who actually does smile while practicing.(3) She gives instructions while actually doing the poses herself, so you know that her poses and sequence are doable. I also appreciate the fact that she doesn't do ""perfect"" poses.(4) Her introduction to the DVD is very useful and practical (for example, she says that her sequence is not for complete beginners, and that if you are a complete beginner you should check the library for more explanation).(5) Her short presentation on how to do poses using objects in your living room, while wearing jeans, is  very practical and useful.I've tried it a couple of times since I got the DVD recently, and I have no doubt that I will use it often.

1046757,A2D5ZYRQX2IMX5,B000MKXEXI,R. Esposito,"[3, 3]","I love this 45-minute practice. It's not too short and not too long. And, as mentioned, Eva Barash's non-traditional sequencing is a nice change of pace. I love that she doesn't start off with sun salutations. There's not much to add to Beth Cholette's excellent breakdown of the poses, but here are a few I want to mention:- A nice hip twist in plank which is challenging but also a yummy stretch.- In bridge, she has you place a block under your sacrum and then lift your legs up. I am a shoulder stand sissy and this is the perfect way for me to actually enjoy having my legs up in the air.- In her yoga ""calisthenics"" portion she does one move, a combination of (Pilates) toe dips and a reverse crunch, which is pure candy.Eva Barash has a playful, unpretentious attitude and her instruction is both delightful and reassuring. As for pacing, I consider the sun salutations to be just fast enough. They are nowhere near as fast as a Bryan Kest practice, but they will get your heart rate up. The standing poses are held for a good while so you can really dig into the pose. All in all, a well rounded and invigorating practice for the advanced beginner and beyond. (Note: I consider myself an advanced beginner and have been practicing yoga for 6 years.)Although the filming appears to be independently produced, it's very high quality with only some minor audio difficulties when her mic gets muffled. I only mention this for those who are sensitive to sound.

1046758,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B000MKXEXI,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[4, 4]","Dr. Beth Chollette & Caravaggio38 both wrote insightful reviews on both the personality, pace & content of this yoga dvd so I won't be redundant here.The fact Eva does it in the living room is great, she's sweet, like working out with a girlfriend. She's very encouraging, she gives both the Sanskrit & English pose names, she tells you how to move your body well, she uses great analogies, ""lift up your heart"" & even reminders on how not to move or what to watch out for on some poses which most don't give. She also gives a lot of rests in between poses except for during the sun salutations. The extra library tutorial is great. Because of that, I think this is fine for beginner yoga practitioners or even novices. She shows good body awareness, she isn't afraid to add a unique extra stretch during downward dog that really helps open you up that I've always done on my own that's made me relax tight areas.I'd give it 5 stars except for several reasons:She really races through the sun salutations, but luckily that's the only place she races, she spends a perfect amount of time on all other poses. When she did it with just breathing, you see her be more aware of her body & go a little slower. She admits she races after she's done.She has a sweet voice, but she seemed very jittery, overly chatty, racing through words, unable to be quiet though I could see she can be relaxed especially in savasana. It was a bit distracting & I couldn't relax or be more aware of my body because of it. She is silent here whereas most keep talking during savasana which is refreshing. I think it would have been perfect if she did a voice over after so she can be aware of her body during filming & relaxed voice separately. It's probably her first time, so I will look forward to her more relaxed nature in future videos.Eva's occasional choice of words. Though she means to be encouraging & say that she knows it's hard, she kept saying ""we're almost done"" or etc. to remind you that it can be hard. But like anything else, if you keep your mind on connecting or enjoyment, anything hard will not seem so, or even seem easy, if you're enjoying yourself. Constant reminders don't help or tell you something is hard when you don't think it is.The rest after sun salutations bothered me, Yes, sun salutions are demanding, but having me lay down after I'm heated up seems to defeat the purpose. Yes, I'd love a rest & more simple stretches, but there were others I could do that didn't require me to lay down as if we were done.These are minor quibbles, those looking to work out with a knowledgeable, detailed-oriented girlfriend with body awareness will love this. The second time I viewed this, I wasn't bothered at all by her instruction & I was able to relax & sense my body easily.Those looking for a more relaxed narration even with the same amount of info during & body awareness should look to Rodney Yee, Rainbeau Mars, Seane Corn, Better Sex with yoga, Yoga w/Ateeka, etc.",4,"Down-to-earth, friendly, beginner  yoga session",1201219200,"01 25, 2008",2008,2977,"['Dr.', 'Beth', 'Chollette', 'Caravaggio38', 'wrote', 'insightful', 'reviews', 'personality', 'pace', 'content', 'yoga', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'redundant', 'here.The', 'fact', 'Eva', 'living', 'room', 'great', 'sweet', 'working', 'out', 'girlfriend', 'very', 'encouraging', 'Sanskrit', 'English', 'pose', 'names', 'how', 'move', 'body', 'well', 'great', 'analogies', 'lift', 'up', 'heart', 'even', 'reminders', 'how', 'not', 'move', 'what', 'watch', 'out', 'poses', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'also', 'lot', 'rests', 'poses', 'sun', 'salutations', 'extra', 'library', 'tutorial', 'great', 'think', 'fine', 'beginner', 'yoga', 'practitioners', 'even', 'novices', 'good', 'body', 'awareness', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'add', 'unique', 'extra', 'stretch', 'downward', 'dog', 'really', 'open', ""'ve"", 'always', 'done', 'own', 'made', 'relax', 'tight', 'areas.I', ""'d"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'several', 'reasons', 'really', 'sun', 'salutations', 'luckily', 'only', 'place', 'perfect', 'amount', 'time', 'other', 'poses', 'When', 'did', 'just', 'breathing', 'see', 'be', 'more', 'aware', 'body', 'go', 'little', 'slower', 'races', 'done.She', 'sweet', 'voice', 'seemed', 'very', 'jittery', 'overly', 'chatty', 'racing', 'words', 'unable', 'be', 'quiet', 'could', 'see', 'can', 'be', 'relaxed', 'especially', 'savasana', 'was', 'bit', 'distracting', 'could', ""n't"", 'relax', 'be', 'more', 'aware', 'body', 'silent', 'here', 'most', 'keep', 'talking', 'savasana', 'refreshing', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'did', 'voice', 'can', 'be', 'aware', 'body', 'filming', 'relaxed', 'voice', 'separately', 'probably', 'first', 'time', 'will', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'relaxed', 'nature', 'future', 'videos.Eva', 'occasional', 'choice', 'words', 'be', 'encouraging', 'say', 'hard', 'kept', 'saying', ""'re"", 'almost', 'done', 'etc', 'remind', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'anything', 'else', 'keep', 'mind', 'connecting', 'enjoyment', 'anything', 'hard', 'will', 'not', 'seem', 'so', 'even', 'seem', 'easy', ""'re"", 'enjoying', 'Constant', 'reminders', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'tell', 'something', 'hard', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'is.The', 'rest', 'sun', 'salutations', 'bothered', 'Yes', 'sun', 'salutions', 'are', 'demanding', 'having', 'lay', 'down', ""'m"", 'heated', 'up', 'defeat', 'purpose', 'Yes', ""'d"", 'love', 'rest', 'more', 'simple', 'stretches', 'were', 'others', 'could', 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'require', 'lay', 'down', 'as', 'were', 'done.These', 'are', 'minor', 'quibbles', 'looking', 'work', 'out', 'knowledgeable', 'detailed-oriented', 'girlfriend', 'body', 'awareness', 'will', 'love', 'second', 'time', 'viewed', 'was', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'instruction', 'was', 'able', 'relax', 'sense', 'body', 'easily.Those', 'looking', 'more', 'relaxed', 'narration', 'even', 'same', 'amount', 'info', 'body', 'awareness', 'should', 'look', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'Seane', 'Corn', 'Better', 'Sex', 'yoga', 'Yoga', 'w/Ateeka', 'etc']",Living Room Yoga: Strengthen And Lengthen
