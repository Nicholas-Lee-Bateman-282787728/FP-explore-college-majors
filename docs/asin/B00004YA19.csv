(If they continue with part nine, and so on, it's problably gonna end the wrong way!)At last I say, all 'The Land Before Time' movies has always something useful to learn kids, just like frinedship, the place in our life, and the mysteries of the infinite universe.",5,This is just as good as it gets!,1002585600,"10 9, 2001",2001,843,"['think', 'best', 'whole', 'serie', 'eight', 'cartoons', 'Littlefoot', 'pals', 'nothing', 'can', 'beat', 'first', 'original', 'movie', '1988', 'course', ""'The"", 'Land', 'Time', '7', 'only', 'three', 'songs', 'are', 'three', 'best', 'whole', 'serie', 'history', 'more', 'mysterious', 'Alien', 'dinos', 'cold', 'stone', 'outer', 'space', 'therefore', 'little', 'more', 'different', 'other', 'six', 'movies.This', 'movie', 'have', 'loaned', 'scenes', 'different', 'movies', ""'Cliffhanger'.I"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', '8', 'hope', 'last', 'movie', 'Littlefoot', 'pals', 'continue', 'part', 'nine', 'so', 'problably', 'gon', 'end', 'wrong', 'way', 'last', 'say', ""'The"", 'Land', 'Time', 'movies', 'always', 'something', 'useful', 'learn', 'kids', 'just', 'frinedship', 'place', 'life', 'mysteries', 'infinite', 'universe']",The Land Before Time: The Stone of Cold Fire

I got tired of watching the same 2 over and over again so I ordered about 5 different one. Since now I have about 7 and watch them VERY frequently I have noticed a pattern with these.First of all none of them have compared to the first which is by far my favorite for several reasons. The main reason being that it is one of the only ones where the kids get seperated from their families and they search to go home. In EVERY other movie I own the kids run of on their on there own without their parents!!! This drives me crazy! There are great morals in most of these stories but the fact that nearly every movie they run off behind their parents back annoys me to no end. What kind of message does that send our kids?? Well the parents no want to dont go after the stone of cold fire, but we should go anyways!?!?!Besides running off on their parents yet again the other thing that I do not like is that quit frankly I find the story a bit chessy. The movies seem to get alittle worse/chessier the longer they go on.
