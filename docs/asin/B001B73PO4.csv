The series found its way onto DVD in 2008, but has been out-of-print for quite sometime. Mill Creek Entertainment recently released a 4-disc set of the Liberty's Kids featuring all 40 episodes.Set in 1773, British teenage girl, Sarah Phillips, travels to the Thirteen Colonies to search for her missing father, Major Phillips, and stays as a guest at Benjamin Franklin's home. She takes a job as a reporter for Franklin's newspaper as she believes a viewpoint from a British girl is just want the newspaper needs. She befriends fourteen-year-old James Hiller, eight-year-old Henri Richard Maurice Dutoit LeFevbre, and Moses. At first Sarah is dedicated to her home country England, but towards the end of the series she clearly understands why the Thirteen Colonies wanted their freedom.The episodes on the four-disc set are:Disc One:THE BOSTON TEA PARTYTHE INTOLERABLE ACTSUNITED WE STANDLIBERTY OR DEATH!MIDNIGHT RIDETHE SHOT HEARD 'ROUND THE WORLDGREEN MOUNTAIN BOYSTHE SECOND CONTINENTAL CONGRESSBUNKER HILLPOSTMASTER GENERAL FRANKLINDisc Two:WASHINGTON TAKES COMMANDCOMMON SENSETHE FIRST FOURTH OF JULYNEW YORK, NEW YORKTHE TURTLEONE LIFE TO LOSE""CAPTAIN MOLLY""AMERICAN CRISISACROSS THE DELAWAREAN AMERICAN IN PARISDisc Three:SYBIL LUDINGTONLAFAYETTE ARRIVESTHE HESSIANS ARE COMINGVALLEY FORGEALLIES AT LASTHONOR AND COMPROMISETHE NEW FRONTIER 1779NOT YET BEGUN TO FIGHTTHE GREAT GALVEZIN PRAISE OF BENDisc Four:BOSTONIANSBENEDICT ARNOLDCONFLICT IN THE SOUTHDEBORAH SAMSON -- SOLDIER OF THE REVOLUTIONJAMES ARMISTEADYORKTOWNBORN FREE AND EQUAL 1781 - 1783THE MAN WHO WOULDN'T BE KINGGOING HOME 1786""WE THE PEOPLE""Liberty's Kids is wonderfully animated series with a great voice cast, including several big name guest-voices, but the main focus of the series is to teach children about the American Revolution. There are only forty episodes in the series, but it does have a satisfying ending with the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1789. I do think it is odd that the children never age during the span of six years, but I guess that is the reason why it is called a cartoon.

I remember the original run on my local PBS channel. Granted I'm not the target demographic but I was instantly hooked upon watching the first episode. The show took you by the hand and tried to give you a semblance of what life was like during the Revolutionary War. Most of the perspective was through the eyes of the children featured in the series.This is a great educational tool for children for learning about the formative years of the country. It's a good PG show that any parent can feel comfortable in knowing that this is something their children can watch without worry. For the price offered here on Amazon and the run time, almost 900 minutes, this is a bargain.I was amazed to learn how many different actors did voice work for the series. Truly a standout in the field of network cartoons. I had wished it had run longer, but being originally aired on PBS I am grateful that it ran for the brief time that it did air. I consider myself lucky I had come across it during it's initial run. Since it has been re-released, this is the second production run on DVD, I had to pick up a copy.For educational purposes it's great for the intended target audience. For adults, it depends on whether you are into American history or the Revolutionary War. This is an excellent learning tool in a format that can hold most children's attention.

Williams, Bill Dial, Marc & Ellen Zicree, Jim McGrath, Brooks Wachtel, Jay Abromowitz, Cliff MacGillivray & Kelly Ward, Bruce Franklin Singer, Michael Medlock, Robby London, Jim Fisher & Jim Staahl, Paul Diamond, Phil HarnageAn ambitious, 40-episode animated series created for PBS, I would hope that ""Liberty's Kids"" might have been utilized by some teachers to augment their American history curriculum. (Not to replace, mind you, but augment.) When I was a kid, history was kind of dry, but this series is a great way to bring what is really a very exciting story to a level that kids understand, are compelled by (my kids saw every one when they were young) and avoids being too stilted.Young people are the fictional lead characters who thread us through real events throughout the Revolutionary War Period. It's not the first time cartoon watchers have seen this narrative technique. Archie comics have been doing it for decades and of course, CBS broadcast their final Filmation Archie series, ""The U.S. of Archie,"" with the conceit that Archie and his friends somehow had ancestors during every crucial period in American history. Then there's ""This is America, Charlie Brown,"" which didn't even explain how the Peanuts characters materialized in these historic settings.""Liberty's Kids"" doesn't star familiar cartoon characters. Instead, it stars a very impressive roster of celebrity guest voices. The combination of acting styles sometimes clash a bit, between the voice actors specific kind of style, the somewhat naturalistic approach of certain star voices and the rather surprising casting of others.To their credit, the stars do give their all. But once I discovered Billy Crystal was voicing John Adams, I had the same challenges Phil Harris fans had when watching ""The Jungle Book."" The personality is just too ingrained in my head. Sorry to single him out, as Crystal has proven quite capable of drama before and he does not phone in John Adams here. But he's very distinctive, especially now that Mike Wazowski has appeared in two hit movies. Even though Ben Stiller has also voiced the lead in the Madagascar movies, his voice is not as unmistakable as Crystal.And it's not like Walter Cronkite isn't unmistakable too. Cronkite was not an actor, but he was a master of presenting words and you would not expect him to be anyone but himself in the role of Ben Franklin, who is the only continuing adult character in the series.DIC's animation is very much the slick TV type you might see in an upscale direct-to-DVD movie, with elaborate execution in some places and limited movement in others. The writing is uniformly solid, scripted by such primetime veterans as Bill Dial (""WKRP in Cincinnati"") and Marc Zicree (""Star Trek: The Next Generation""). The best moments are not necessarily the ""big"" historical ones, but rather the lesser known, realistic details, such as a scene in which James, the young reporter, assumes that tar and feathering is a laugh fest until he is told how horrifyingly painful it is.This is a very affordable reissue of the complete series. It should be noted that it, contains the dramatic content of the episodes without the interstitials that replaced commercial breaks on PBS. An earlier set did include them as separate bonus features. They do not advance the narrative but if you want them, you may want to seek out the earlier release.Episode 1September 2, 2002The Boston Tea PartyEpisode 2September 3, 2002Intolerable ActsEpisode

1170608,ALTJKDWT2B1GB,B001B73PO4,James,"[2, 3]","While Liberty's Kids, is an animated story set in the time of Colonial America, it is also an outstanding introduction to the life and times of the people of the Revolution as seen through the eyes of two teenagers, Matt Hiller (American) and Sarah Phillips (British) along with a tag-a-long young French boy, Henri.  As apprentices to Benjamin Franklin at the Pennsylvania Gazette, these three kids have adventures taking them to the people and places made famous in Colonial History.While the show is animated it is anything but a cartoon.  It is in fact a fine introduction to Revolutionary War American History and won't fail to hold you attention for each of the half hour episodes.  History if often a dry recital of dates, places and people but Liberty's Kids makes history come alive as you follow the trio from place to place as they gather the news for Dr. Franklin's paper.The creators of the show did an outstanding job not just as artists and animators but also as historians in telling you the story of to how American gained its independence.  While primarily aimed at children from ages 8-14, adults will find the shows compelling.  It's quite addicting.  Once you see an episode you will want to see more.This package is an investment, not just in entertainment but in education as well.

Patience is a virtue, and I'm absolutely willing to wait for October to get the ENTIRE series of Liberty's Kids for the far-more reasonable price of forty-four bucks!As I've mentioned in the Teacher's Edition, this is the far better deal out there (seriously, what teacher can pay 500+ dollars for ONE show?  Is PBS really that unaware of most teachers' ridiculously low salaries?  I don't know . . . maybe they expect ""the school"" to buy it for their library or something -- but which school would pay that much cash for a six-disc DVD set?)So . . . on with my review of the series:I've loved this show since I first saw it back in early 2003. During AP US History, this show actually helped incite curiosity and understanding for the complex period that is the American Revolution. It's also the series that made me curious into looking into American History deeper, and reading up on the finer details of America's birth.The timeline, which features events from the Boston Massacre to the ratification for the US Constitution, is actually quite accurate -- they merely paint into the story the fictional characters of James (the teenage American-patriot), Sarah (the unsure British-loyalist), and Henri (the younger French-sidekick) alongside the historical Founding Fathers.First airing on PBS, the 40 half-hour episodes are actually quite close to being a half-hour long each (with no commercials originally intended, we get to enjoy more story, as well as fun trivia breaks in between the main story, hosted by James, Sarah, Henri, and even Dr. Franklin).Among other things to enjoy are the theme song, ""Through My Own Eyes,"" as well as the wide range of voice actors (the cast ranges from Walter Cronkite as Ben Franklin to Billy Crystal as John Adams, with Governor Schwartzenegger, Whoopi Goldberg, Aaron Carter and many more familar voices from Hollywood).So, yes be sure to buy this series, you won't be dissapointed -- it's wonderfully smart, historically accurate, and great fun for the whole family and you'll be surprised to actually learn loads from it . . . again, just be sure to order THIS one -- the one with the better price. :)",5,Just what I've been waiting for -- October can't come soon enough!!,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,2176,"['See', 'What', 'did', 'tell', 'ya', 'Patience', 'virtue', ""'m"", 'absolutely', 'willing', 'wait', 'October', 'get', 'ENTIRE', 'series', 'Liberty', 'Kids', 'far-more', 'reasonable', 'price', 'forty-four', 'bucks', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'Teacher', 'Edition', 'far', 'better', 'deal', 'there', 'seriously', 'what', 'teacher', 'can', 'pay', '500+', 'dollars', 'ONE', 'show', 'PBS', 'really', 'unaware', 'most', 'teachers', 'ridiculously', 'low', 'salaries', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'expect', 'school', 'buy', 'library', 'something', 'school', 'would', 'pay', 'much', 'cash', 'six-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'So', 'review', 'series', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'show', 'first', 'saw', 'back', 'early', '2003', 'AP', 'US', 'History', 'show', 'actually', 'helped', 'incite', 'curiosity', 'understanding', 'complex', 'period', 'American', 'Revolution', 'also', 'series', 'made', 'curious', 'looking', 'American', 'History', 'deeper', 'reading', 'up', 'finer', 'details', 'America', 'birth.The', 'timeline', 'events', 'Boston', 'Massacre', 'ratification', 'US', 'Constitution', 'actually', 'quite', 'accurate', 'merely', 'paint', 'story', 'fictional', 'characters', 'James', 'teenage', 'American-patriot', 'Sarah', 'unsure', 'British-loyalist', 'Henri', 'younger', 'French-sidekick', 'historical', 'Founding', 'Fathers.First', 'airing', 'PBS', '40', 'half-hour', 'episodes', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'close', 'being', 'half-hour', 'long', 'commercials', 'originally', 'intended', 'get', 'enjoy', 'more', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'fun', 'trivia', 'breaks', 'main', 'story', 'hosted', 'James', 'Sarah', 'Henri', 'even', 'Dr.', 'Franklin', 'other', 'things', 'enjoy', 'are', 'theme', 'song', 'My', 'Own', 'Eyes', 'as', 'well', 'wide', 'range', 'voice', 'actors', 'cast', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'Ben', 'Franklin', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'John', 'Adams', 'Governor', 'Schwartzenegger', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Aaron', 'Carter', 'many', 'more', 'familar', 'voices', 'Hollywood', '.So', 'yes', 'be', 'sure', 'buy', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed', 'wonderfully', 'smart', 'historically', 'accurate', 'great', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'actually', 'learn', 'loads', 'again', 'just', 'be', 'sure', 'order', 'THIS', 'one', 'one', 'better', 'price']",Liberty's Kids: Complete Series
