It's a story about growing up in the chaos that is war and a story about figuring out what you want to do, or be, and taking the first steps into that direction of your life. I personally love the series completely and it is one of my all time favorites.Now this boxset format disappointed me a little bit. I love simoun and did buy this set as soon as it was offered but they stuck all 5 disks into a single normal dvd case. I understand that media blasters like everyone else has to cut costs somewhere but there is just something nice about holding a nice box with slimpacks of your favorite series (with the cover art they released the single editions of) in your hand instead of one dvd case.Overall if you don't mind the yuri content(everyone in this world is born female till 17 when they choose their gender) it is an awesome series and this boxset is a cheap way to get the complete collection.",5,Awesome in a thin package,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,1238,"['Simoun', 'series', ""'ve"", 'run', 'reviews', 'people', 'love', 'series', 'hate', 'it.I', 'personally', 'love', 'series', 'when', 'media', 'blasters/anime', 'finally', 'put', 'out', 'box', 'set', '5', 'disk', 'series', 'here', 'US', 'snapped', 'up', 'eagerly.This', 'story', 'war', 'affects', 'war', 'innocent', 'people', 'drug', 'story', 'growing', 'up', 'chaos', 'war', 'story', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'want', 'do', 'be', 'taking', 'first', 'steps', 'direction', 'life', 'personally', 'love', 'series', 'completely', 'one', 'time', 'favorites.Now', 'boxset', 'format', 'disappointed', 'little', 'bit', 'love', 'simoun', 'did', 'buy', 'set', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'offered', 'stuck', '5', 'disks', 'single', 'normal', 'dvd', 'case', 'understand', 'media', 'blasters', 'everyone', 'else', 'cut', 'costs', 'somewhere', 'just', 'something', 'nice', 'holding', 'nice', 'box', 'slimpacks', 'favorite', 'series', 'cover', 'art', 'released', 'single', 'editions', 'hand', 'instead', 'one', 'dvd', 'case.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'yuri', 'content', 'everyone', 'world', 'born', 'female', 'till', '17', 'when', 'choose', 'gender', 'awesome', 'series', 'boxset', 'cheap', 'way', 'get', 'complete', 'collection']",Simoun: Complete Collection
1245987,A36INLW8OL3A73,B0020SC17U,"D. Aiken ""social observer""","[6, 14]","The cover shown does NOT reflect the contents in any manner. This is not a yuri series and the two girls shown are not in the cast. I do not know why there is a great urge to brand this a lesbian series. There are no teen aged boys in this convoluted society and all the emotionality between the players is therefore,quite normal.You just have to watch it a little more carefully to see what is really going on. No sex,no fan service,no nudity. Until they go through the Springs and choose a sex,all are girls. This series is quite powerful in its messages as anti-war and the distain for unfeeling adults,government officials and religious leaders that pervert the religion to suit ""unholy"" needs while convincing the little girls they are just offering prayers to the diety when in fact they are killing people. The art used for the Simoun flying machines and that used for the girls is very good to most excellent. The difference in artist styles and qualities is the tip-off of what the authors of this series is trying to do,in my opinion. If they were trying to create a ""yuri-fest"",they failed. No girls gone wild,just a few that had enough of the crap. No toplessness.",5,Simoun,1257897600,"11 11, 2009",2009,1176,"['cover', 'shown', 'NOT', 'reflect', 'contents', 'manner', 'not', 'yuri', 'series', 'two', 'girls', 'shown', 'are', 'not', 'cast', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'great', 'urge', 'brand', 'lesbian', 'series', 'are', 'teen', 'aged', 'boys', 'convoluted', 'society', 'emotionality', 'players', 'therefore', 'quite', 'normal.You', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'little', 'more', 'carefully', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'sex', 'fan', 'service', 'nudity', 'go', 'Springs', 'choose', 'sex', 'are', 'girls', 'series', 'quite', 'powerful', 'messages', 'anti-war', 'distain', 'unfeeling', 'adults', 'government', 'officials', 'religious', 'leaders', 'pervert', 'religion', 'suit', 'unholy', 'needs', 'convincing', 'little', 'girls', 'are', 'just', 'offering', 'prayers', 'diety', 'when', 'fact', 'are', 'killing', 'people', 'art', 'used', 'Simoun', 'flying', 'machines', 'used', 'girls', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'excellent', 'difference', 'artist', 'styles', 'qualities', 'tip-off', 'what', 'authors', 'series', 'trying', 'do', 'opinion', 'were', 'trying', 'create', 'yuri-fest', 'failed', 'girls', 'gone', 'wild', 'just', 'few', 'had', 'enough', 'crap', 'toplessness']",Simoun: Complete Collection

The only problem for me was that most of the characters where either to melancholy or bipolar in the series to truly have any feelings for on what happens with them.  The question on whether choose to be either male or female after your seventeenth birthday was a pretty good story-arc and you'll see the questions that each of the pilots are asking themselves about that throughout the series, especially the couples that form between the pilots and their crew in the series.  If you watch the show from start to finish than the ending shouldn't come to much as a surprise and while there is some disappointment at how some of the characters ended up it's still a pretty decent ending for the series.  The only other thing is while there are battle scenes there not really the exciting fast paced action scenes you'll see in other series like Gundam or Naruto, also it was a little humorous to hear the male characters in the series be voiced by female actresses.  So if you like yuri animes or more of a somewhat philosophical and with a dash of romance anime here's one to check out for your home library..",3,"Good Animation, Good Music, But Storyline Is A Little Disappointing",1246665600,"07 4, 2009",2009,1265,"['set', 'pretty', 'good', 'deal', 'price', 'even', 'only', 'subbed', ""n't"", 'subtract', 'overall', 'entertainment', 'series', 'only', 'problem', 'was', 'most', 'characters', 'where', 'melancholy', 'bipolar', 'series', 'truly', 'have', 'feelings', 'what', 'question', 'choose', 'be', 'either', 'male', 'female', 'seventeenth', 'birthday', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'story-arc', ""'ll"", 'see', 'questions', 'pilots', 'are', 'asking', 'series', 'especially', 'couples', 'form', 'pilots', 'crew', 'series', 'watch', 'show', 'start', 'finish', 'ending', 'should', ""n't"", 'come', 'much', 'surprise', 'disappointment', 'how', 'characters', 'ended', 'up', 'still', 'pretty', 'decent', 'ending', 'series', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'are', 'battle', 'scenes', 'there', 'not', 'really', 'exciting', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'see', 'other', 'series', 'Gundam', 'Naruto', 'also', 'was', 'little', 'humorous', 'hear', 'male', 'characters', 'series', 'be', 'voiced', 'female', 'actresses', 'So', 'like', 'yuri', 'animes', 'more', 'somewhat', 'philosophical', 'dash', 'romance', 'anime', 'here', 'one', 'check', 'out', 'home', 'library..']",Simoun: Complete Collection
