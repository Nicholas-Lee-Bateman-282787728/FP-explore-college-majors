The episode of his modeling career simply had the entire house in tears...we didn't know a dog could smile.  Keen Eddie is a series of misadventures amid the London Scotland Yard dectective bureau with an out of place NYC detective finding his way in spite of the common language. Adding to the comedy of errors are the fabulous London locations and notable British castmates including newbie, Sienna Miller.Mark Valley as Eddie is a cop out of place with Scotland Yard and his sidekick is a nervous nellie when it comes to the NYC styles of dectective work that his American counterpart enjoys.  However, the British humor and staid upper lip contrast to more in your face policework falls short when Eddie encounters the ill-tempered and too thin, Sienna Miller, a college girl who is his room mate.  The bickering is old as it was done to death in Remington Steele and Moonlighting, however, with the inclusion of the dog and cat (symbolic?), the room mates are almost tolerable.Smart writing, fast edits, and swish-pan camera work make this collection of weekly shows one of the wittier series which of course was cancelled after the first season, and only lends to its popularity and credibility that if it's good, its no longer on air.

It's a shame when there are shows with great characters and great stories that aren't allowed to come to fruition.  Keen Eddie was a witty, entertaining, British infused cop show.  Part of what made it unique and cool was the fact that it was set in England.  That's something you never see on American network television, which is why I turn to BBC America regularly.Keen Eddie is full of colorful and interesting characters played by perfectly cast actors.  Mark Valley as the title character is completely comfortable in the role and has great chemistry with the entire supporting cast.  And I will always be indebted to this show for introducing me to the lovely and talented Sienna Miller (whom I'm now obsessed with) playing Eddie's roommate, Fiona.  The budding love story between Eddie and Fiona was the glue the held the entire episode run together.  Which is why I am irate that this got cancelled before that story could be properly fleshed out (and why this set only gets 4 stars...it's incomplete).Keen Eddie was a show that had everything, a great blend of drama and comedy.

837970,A356RFKNIG043B,B0002JP4DW,K. Swanson,"[11, 11]","4.5 starsFound this at the library and enjoyed it a lot. It's both intelligently funny and very well-directed, and all the actors are good and often excellent (Valley). There is little wasted time; the quick cuts and superfast flash-forwards make the viewer pay attention, and that attention is well-rewarded. Creator JH Wyman is clearly a big Guy Ritchie fan, as the cuts and pace are extremely reminiscent of his style; if you loved Lock Stock and Snatch you'll love this too is my guess.By far my favorite episode is Horse Heir, which is as funny as any tv episode I've seen since the best of Arrested Development or Eastbound And Down. That one alone is worth checking this series out for; it's better than most comedy movies these days.The rest are hit and miss, mostly hit. There are plenty of nice themes running through this sadly brief series, my favorite being Eddie's hallucinations of Moneypenny's lust for him. Some of those are flat out classic. His tension with his flatmate is also often very funny, especially if you've ever suffered an insufferable roommate.But imagine my surprise upon reading all these reviews lamenting the loss of the original music (which may have been either greed from the studio, or lack of foresight in buying the rights to both tv and dvd, which is not uncommon, moreso if the show's future is uncertain; Malcolm In The Middle saw a similar fate). I'd LOVE to see the shows again with it, especially with the Specials and Madness and other great ska groups providing the tunes. It does suck that it's gone, but the good news is that the show was very enjoyable without it as well. Kinda glad I never saw this on tv, so I don't know what I'm missing.Sidenote: the theme is from the song Mastermind by Daniel Ash, of Bauhaus and Love And Rockets fame, and while it's a good one, I kept thinking I'd heard it before, especially the Link Wray-ish guitar tone. Finally I realized it's a lift, of both sound and melody, of parts of Robert Palmer's ""Johnny and Mary"", with a House beat. Check it out and see what you think. I rather like Ash's background music during the show; it may not be as fitting as the original pop tunes, but it certainly has its moments.All in all, Keen Eddie is very good humor, and a little too smart for the average American tv viewer, just like AD and Malcolm, both cancelled far too soon. And make sure to catch Horse Heir...it is truly hilarious.PS And looking around online I found various folks pointing out that this dvd set is in the wrong running order, which I wondered about due to strange shifts in character history (and matchbooks!) while watching it in the dvd sequence. Apparently the proper order is as follows; watch the shows in this sequence and you're bound to have a more logical viewing experience:1, 2, 9, 12, 6, 10, 7, 11, 8, 5, 4, 3, 13Enjoy.",5,"Guy Ritchie meets Kojak!

I recently decided to give it a go and have very much enjoyed it.  All the main characters are very entertaining and the guest spots are wonderful.

A classic fish out of water tale with a twist as Eddie seems to be doing quite well other then not understanding british people very well.

It quickly became a critical favourite, but it was cancelled due to low ratings and the stupid Fox network shuffling it around and not giving it enough exposure.Mark Valley plays Det. Eddie Arlette, a New York City cop sent to London, England to correct a botched drug bust. The flat he was supposed to be renting is still occupied by the owner's daughter, Fiona Bickerton. Fiona adamantly refuses to let Eddie stay and pretty much dislikes him from the first moment. However, she must let Eddie stay because her mother -- the owner -- is still under the impression that Fiona is at university and Fiona has failed to mention that she has dropped out of school. As soon as Eddie's case is solved, he is offered a position within Scotland Yard. Eddie's new associates include:* Inspector Monty Pippin, his sex-obsessed but stylish and well-dressed partner.* Superintendant Nathaniel Johnson, his humourless superior who is &quot;not sure he likes Eddie but he likes results.&quot;* Carol Ross, Nathaniel's secretary who appears quiet but wields a secret sexy power over Eddie.* And of course, Pete. Eddie's tough dog who enjoys biting Eddie's hands, menacing strangers, and shagging Fiona's cat.This show was repeated on Bravo earlier this year, along with 6 episodes that had been previously unaired on Fox. All episodes should be available on this DVD set.The show contains a lively and diverse soundtrack of techno, rock, rap, etc. Flashbacks, flights of fancy, fast-paced camera movements are part of what makes this show interesting and entertaining. Eddie's interactions with Fiona, Pippin and especially Carol are what makes this show enjoyable. Fiona resents having him live with her; they both hate each other, but you can tell they've secretly become fond of each other. Pippin is an unrepentent skirt-chaser; Eddie's concern for how his lifestyle might get him into trouble is sweet, but the two respect each other. And Carol... No, I won't spoil anything; you have to watch it. ;-)I strongly recommend this show.",5,A Keen Series,1090627200,"07 24, 2004",2004,2123,"['was', 'inspired', 'cop/action/comedy', 'show', 'premiered', 'Fox', 'network', 'summer', ""'03"", 'quickly', 'became', 'critical', 'favourite', 'was', 'cancelled', 'due', 'low', 'ratings', 'stupid', 'Fox', 'network', 'shuffling', 'around', 'not', 'giving', 'enough', 'exposure.Mark', 'Valley', 'plays', 'Det', 'Eddie', 'Arlette', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'cop', 'sent', 'London', 'England', 'correct', 'botched', 'drug', 'bust', 'flat', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'renting', 'still', 'occupied', 'owner', 'daughter', 'Fiona', 'Bickerton', 'Fiona', 'adamantly', 'let', 'Eddie', 'stay', 'pretty', 'much', 'dislikes', 'first', 'moment', 'However', 'must', 'let', 'Eddie', 'stay', 'mother', 'owner', 'still', 'impression', 'Fiona', 'university', 'Fiona', 'failed', 'mention', 'dropped', 'school', 'As', 'soon', 'Eddie', 'case', 'solved', 'offered', 'position', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Eddie', 'new', 'associates', 'include', '*', 'Inspector', 'Monty', 'Pippin', 'sex-obsessed', 'stylish', 'well-dressed', 'partner', '*', 'Superintendant', 'Nathaniel', 'Johnson', 'humourless', 'superior', 'who', 'quot', 'not', 'sure', 'Eddie', 'results.', 'quot', 'Carol', 'Ross', 'Nathaniel', 'secretary', 'who', 'quiet', 'secret', 'sexy', 'power', 'Eddie', '*', 'course', 'Pete', 'Eddie', 'tough', 'dog', 'who', 'biting', 'Eddie', 'hands', 'menacing', 'strangers', 'shagging', 'Fiona', 'cat.This', 'show', 'was', 'repeated', 'Bravo', 'earlier', 'year', '6', 'episodes', 'had', 'been', 'previously', 'unaired', 'Fox', 'episodes', 'should', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', 'set.The', 'show', 'lively', 'diverse', 'soundtrack', 'techno', 'rock', 'rap', 'etc', 'Flashbacks', 'flights', 'fancy', 'fast-paced', 'camera', 'movements', 'are', 'part', 'what', 'show', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'Eddie', 'interactions', 'Fiona', 'Pippin', 'especially', 'Carol', 'are', 'what', 'show', 'enjoyable', 'Fiona', 'resents', 'having', 'live', 'hate', 'other', 'can', 'tell', ""'ve"", 'secretly', 'become', 'fond', 'other', 'Pippin', 'unrepentent', 'skirt-chaser', 'Eddie', 'concern', 'how', 'lifestyle', 'might', 'get', 'trouble', 'sweet', 'two', 'respect', 'other', 'Carol', 'No', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'have', 'watch', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'show']",N/A
