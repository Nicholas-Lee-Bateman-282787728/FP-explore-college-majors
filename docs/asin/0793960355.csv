He is right up there with John Cleese, Jennifer Saunders, Rowan Atkinson, hell anyone who is breathing, as the funniest person alive.He  is also helped by a great supporting cast. The actors who play Janice, his  wife, and Everton, his whipping boy, are perfect. It is a great  introduction to a great show.

It strikes me as strange that the BBC has not seen fit to release all of the episodes, let alone on DVD (where they belong!)  Lenny Harry is a god of comedic timing and posseses an uncanny ability to play the ever-seething straight man.  The writing is top-notch; if there is a bit of a weak link here, it is the fact that the rest of the cast, while excellent in thier own light, can't keep up with the lead!",5,We want more!!,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,480,"['have', 'always', 'thought', 'Chef', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'sitcoms', 'period', 'strange', 'BBC', 'not', 'seen', 'fit', 'release', 'episodes', 'let', 'alone', 'DVD', 'where', 'belong', 'Lenny', 'Harry', 'god', 'comedic', 'timing', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'play', 'ever-seething', 'straight', 'man', 'writing', 'top-notch', 'bit', 'weak', 'link', 'here', 'fact', 'rest', 'cast', 'excellent', 'thier', 'own', 'light', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'lead']",N/A

Massaar ""Len Massaar""","[4, 5]","I first saw Lenny Henry when he was very young in London; 'Three of a Kind' was a 'living color' equivalent, BBC of course and starred Tracy Ullman too (before she hopped over the pond and hit it big in the USA). Chef, a MUCH later show, is a very good show indeed, a (probably now) classic with enough subtle, quiet moments to offset the deep sarcarm of the Chef-character in this kitchen. 'Fawlty Towers' fans of sarcasm will not be disappointed, though it wouldn't be fair to say that this was all that was on offer here. The 'lowest form of wit' is indeed used in abundance, but it is more the Chef-character's attack-is-the-best-form-of-defense attempt at overcoming vulnerability. Very similar to the Victor Meldrew character in the 'One foot in the Grave' series (equally good, equally BBC). If you've never seen Chef, you will like it if you enjoy clever, simple, well-executed British comedy.",5,"Super, very British show",991958400,"06 8, 2001",2001,901,"['first', 'saw', 'Lenny', 'Henry', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'London', ""'Three"", 'Kind', 'was', ""'living"", 'color', 'equivalent', 'BBC', 'course', 'starred', 'Tracy', 'Ullman', 'too', 'hopped', 'pond', 'hit', 'big', 'USA', 'Chef', 'MUCH', 'later', 'show', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'indeed', 'probably', 'now', 'classic', 'enough', 'subtle', 'quiet', 'moments', 'offset', 'deep', 'sarcarm', 'Chef-character', 'kitchen', ""'Fawlty"", 'Towers', 'fans', 'sarcasm', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'fair', 'say', 'was', 'was', 'offer', 'here', ""'lowest"", 'form', 'wit', 'indeed', 'used', 'abundance', 'more', 'Chef-character', 'attack-is-the-best-form-of-defense', 'attempt', 'overcoming', 'vulnerability', 'Very', 'similar', 'Victor', 'Meldrew', 'character', ""'One"", 'foot', 'Grave', 'series', 'equally', 'good', 'equally', 'BBC', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Chef', 'will', 'like', 'enjoy', 'clever', 'simple', 'well-executed', 'British', 'comedy']",N/A

The final episodes (not available on video, as far as I know) after Chef's wife left, were dreadful. It was at that point the show Jumped the Shark, if you know what I mean.They poured everything into the first series and this video is just great. We meet Chef Gareth Blackstock, his wife Janice, and the Michelin two-star restaurant Le Chateau Anglais. We find out what an unpleasant man (but a brilliant chef) Gareth is, then that the restaurant is in finacial difficulty and Chef must reduce kitchen and staff expenses. Then the restaurant goes into receivership and must be sold. Meanwhile, Chef has hired an unsuitable trainee chef (an old school mate) in order to save money.So Gareth and Janice decide to try to buy the restaurant, which requires them to bow and scrape for the bank manager. At every turn, Gareth loses his temper and unleashes remarkably coherent and witty tirades at just about everyone. The only person who can stand up to him is his wife.These are very funny episodes, much in the tradition of Fawlty Towers. And as an added bonus, you get to find out quite a bit about French cuisine and the restaurant business.",5,Gareth Blackstock and Basil Fawlty - Separated at Birth?,1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,1200,"['first', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'best', 'series', 'final', 'episodes', 'not', 'available', 'video', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'Chef', 'wife', 'left', 'were', 'dreadful', 'was', 'point', 'show', 'Jumped', 'Shark', 'know', 'what', 'mean.They', 'poured', 'everything', 'first', 'series', 'video', 'just', 'great', 'meet', 'Chef', 'Gareth', 'Blackstock', 'wife', 'Janice', 'Michelin', 'two-star', 'restaurant', 'Le', 'Chateau', 'Anglais', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'unpleasant', 'man', 'brilliant', 'chef', 'Gareth', 'then', 'restaurant', 'finacial', 'difficulty', 'Chef', 'must', 'reduce', 'kitchen', 'staff', 'expenses', 'Then', 'restaurant', 'receivership', 'must', 'be', 'sold', 'Meanwhile', 'Chef', 'hired', 'unsuitable', 'trainee', 'chef', 'old', 'school', 'mate', 'order', 'save', 'money.So', 'Gareth', 'Janice', 'decide', 'try', 'buy', 'restaurant', 'bow', 'scrape', 'bank', 'manager', 'turn', 'Gareth', 'temper', 'unleashes', 'remarkably', 'coherent', 'witty', 'tirades', 'just', 'everyone', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'wife.These', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'episodes', 'much', 'tradition', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'added', 'bonus', 'get', 'find', 'out', 'quite', 'bit', 'French', 'cuisine', 'restaurant', 'business']",N/A
