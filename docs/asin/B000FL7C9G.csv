It was interesting, although the times are so removed from our time, that there were no laws at all to contain the things he did. Beheading 2 wives, divorcing 2 wives, and killing innumerable people, he remained incredibly popular. Most of this was in his desire for a son.  He went against the Catholic Church, the will of his people, and the desire for riches in his search for immortality.  This is a very interesting documentary by National Geographic.",4,"Interesting , brutal king",1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,562,"['Whenever', 'King', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'found', 'something', 'standing', 'way', 'brutalized', 'erased', 'killed', 'was', 'interesting', 'times', 'are', 'so', 'removed', 'time', 'were', 'laws', 'contain', 'things', 'did', 'Beheading', '2', 'wives', 'divorcing', '2', 'wives', 'killing', 'innumerable', 'people', 'remained', 'incredibly', 'popular', 'Most', 'was', 'desire', 'son', 'went', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'will', 'people', 'desire', 'riches', 'search', 'immortality', 'very', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'National', 'Geographic']",N/A

992401,A2RMPXPACNJT9Z,B000FL7C9G,"E. Willaims ""EW""","[65, 72]","This was a real-world representation of his monarchy. It concentrates on how the king started out as an excellent statesman and devout Catholic, but how his philandering and desire for a male heir (along with snubbing the church) led to his downfall. So what if the lady used the B- word? Get over it! This is the 21st century, and she was right. As for the reference to the fact that all of the people were interviewed were Americans again I say so what? I happen to think that some aspects of European histroy much more interesting that American history. Is the reviewer attempting to imply that Americans are not qualified to comment on British history?Like I said, the story was pretty accurate, I have read many books on the subject. The tension between Boleyn and Wolsey was depicted very well. The only problem I have is the fact that they spent so much time on Katherine and how Henry was scheming to get rid of her that even the conflict with Ann (by far the most exciting) took a back seat, and his last four wives were crammed into about 30 minutes. Either the part with Katherine should have been shorter or the documentary should have been longer.Just one American's opinion,EW",4,Not That Bad...Pretty Accurate,1186099200,"08 3, 2007",2007,1190,"['was', 'real-world', 'representation', 'monarchy', 'how', 'king', 'started', 'out', 'excellent', 'statesman', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'how', 'philandering', 'desire', 'male', 'heir', 'snubbing', 'church', 'led', 'downfall', 'So', 'what', 'lady', 'used', 'B-', 'word', 'Get', '21st', 'century', 'was', 'right', 'reference', 'fact', 'people', 'were', 'interviewed', 'were', 'Americans', 'again', 'say', 'so', 'what', 'happen', 'think', 'aspects', 'European', 'histroy', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'American', 'history', 'reviewer', 'attempting', 'imply', 'Americans', 'are', 'not', 'qualified', 'comment', 'British', 'history', 'said', 'story', 'was', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'have', 'read', 'many', 'books', 'subject', 'tension', 'Boleyn', 'Wolsey', 'was', 'depicted', 'very', 'well', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'fact', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'Katherine', 'how', 'Henry', 'was', 'scheming', 'get', 'rid', 'even', 'conflict', 'Ann', 'far', 'most', 'exciting', 'took', 'back', 'seat', 'last', 'four', 'wives', 'were', 'crammed', '30', 'minutes', 'part', 'Katherine', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shorter', 'documentary', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'longer.Just', 'one', 'American', 'opinion', 'EW']",N/A

992403,A3MWYPZBKL1NJ,B000FL7C9G,Jeffery Mingo,"[10, 37]","Vince McMahon's XFL was supposed to be like the NFL, but flashier.  This Henry the 8th documentary is meant to be ""extreme"" or ""on steroids"" or ""from hell"" too.  The camera pulls up quickly to a character and freezes.  Images fade to X-ray-like negatives.  On a ""proper"" British subject, this work lacks stodgy British scholars.  Those interviewed are all Americans.  The titles of their books are emphasized over their academic institutions.  One interviewee uses the B-word.  This work was clearly glamorized to seduce Middle America into watching a documentary on a historical figure of which few in my nation would have interest.Along these extravagant lines, the work was almost all cheesy reenactments, with very few paintings.  The man playing Henry has the fakest beard I've ever seen.It said Henry had an out-of-wedlock son (and you know what politically incorrect term the work used for the child).  What happened to him?  It says Henry separated Catherine from Mary.  So who raised Mary?  When the documentary refers to ""madness,"" it speaks of Henry's despotism, vindictiveness, and bloodthirst.  However, I heard he may have suffered from syphilis, thus creating his madness and shaky fertility, but that doesn't come up here.Foucaultians could have a field day on this work.  The common people loved Catherine and defended her.  Power thus circulated from the bottom up.  The work showed that the women and men around Henry were just as scheming and egomaniacal as he.Watching this did make me feel icky.  Henry was sooo nasty.  He's a horrific leader such as Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot, or Idi Amin.",3,History Made Flashy,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,1609,"['Vince', 'McMahon', 'XFL', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'NFL', 'flashier', '8th', 'documentary', 'meant', 'be', 'extreme', 'steroids', 'hell', 'too', 'camera', 'up', 'quickly', 'character', 'freezes', 'Images', 'fade', 'X-ray-like', 'negatives', 'proper', 'British', 'subject', 'work', 'stodgy', 'British', 'scholars', 'interviewed', 'are', 'Americans', 'titles', 'books', 'are', 'emphasized', 'academic', 'institutions', 'One', 'interviewee', 'B-word', 'work', 'was', 'clearly', 'glamorized', 'seduce', 'Middle', 'America', 'watching', 'documentary', 'historical', 'figure', 'few', 'nation', 'would', 'have', 'interest.Along', 'extravagant', 'lines', 'work', 'was', 'almost', 'cheesy', 'reenactments', 'very', 'few', 'paintings', 'man', 'playing', 'Henry', 'fakest', 'beard', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.It', 'said', 'Henry', 'had', 'out-of-wedlock', 'son', 'know', 'what', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'term', 'work', 'used', 'child', 'What', 'happened', 'Henry', 'separated', 'Catherine', 'Mary', 'So', 'who', 'raised', 'Mary', 'When', 'documentary', 'refers', 'madness', 'Henry', 'despotism', 'vindictiveness', 'bloodthirst', 'However', 'heard', 'may', 'have', 'suffered', 'syphilis', 'thus', 'creating', 'madness', 'shaky', 'fertility', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'here.Foucaultians', 'could', 'have', 'field', 'day', 'work', 'common', 'people', 'loved', 'Catherine', 'defended', 'Power', 'thus', 'circulated', 'bottom', 'up', 'work', 'showed', 'women', 'men', 'Henry', 'were', 'just', 'scheming', 'egomaniacal', 'he.Watching', 'did', 'make', 'feel', 'icky', 'Henry', 'was', 'sooo', 'nasty', 'horrific', 'leader', 'such', 'Joseph', 'Stalin', 'Pol', 'Pot', 'Idi', 'Amin']",N/A

I've seen different movies depicting Henry, and (WHAT I've read) they never depict the real King that he was. Most movie versions of his life depict him as a a type of lovavle bulldog. As if he was nothing more then a grumpy uncle. That depiction resembles a half truth about Henry the 8th. In real life he was ruthless, a bully, and by the end of his life insane with power. This is a wonderful dvd. I don't know why it matters who was interviewed, like other reviewers have rambled on about. Whether from England or USA, both sides have had to pick a book up to learn their, and other nation's history. Who cares!Personally, I've watched this dvd several times.
