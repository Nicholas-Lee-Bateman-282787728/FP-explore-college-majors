She's eccentric, to say the least (we ARE talking Whoopi Goldberg, after all), but the boss keeps her because she's also very efficient.One day, ""Jack"" hacks into her computer and convinces her he needs her help. She's supposed to take a message to the British Consulate. OK, she does that, but they think she's just a kook and don't pay any attention to her. Or do they? Then why are people following her, and why does it seem they want to kill her?I will not ruin all the fun by telling you too much. Let's just say that Whoopi gets to display a grand variety of her talents, not to mention some pretty good legs. Wait until you see her get a sequined gown caught in a paper shredder!!!Of course the good guys win in the end, but it make take you (as it did Terry) some time to figure out who are the good guys and who the bad guys -- not to mention the ladies.Good for at least 1,000 laughs.",5,Whoopi Goldberg is A Brilliant Comedienne!,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,1417,"['do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'sick', 'primitive', 'computer', 'terminals', 'not', 'even', 'desk', 'tops', 'folks', 'were', 'terminals', 'big', 'computer', 'air-conditioned', 'room', '1986', 'will', 'enjoy', 'slapstick', 'version', 'spy', 'adventure', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'girl', 'who', 'got', 'involved', 'just', 'wanting', 'be', 'helpful.Jumpin', 'Jack', 'Flash', 'pseudonym', 'guy', 'somewhere', 'who', 'computer', 'Terry', 'Goldberg', 'running', 'routine', 'data', 'transfers', 'bank', 'transfer', 'money', 'foreign', 'banks', 'eccentric', 'say', 'least', 'ARE', 'talking', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'boss', 'also', 'very', 'efficient.One', 'day', 'Jack', 'computer', 'help', 'supposed', 'take', 'message', 'British', 'Consulate', 'OK', 'think', 'just', 'kook', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'do', 'Then', 'why', 'are', 'people', 'following', 'why', 'seem', 'want', 'kill', 'will', 'not', 'ruin', 'fun', 'telling', 'too', 'much', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Whoopi', 'display', 'grand', 'variety', 'talents', 'not', 'mention', 'pretty', 'good', 'legs', 'Wait', 'see', 'get', 'sequined', 'gown', 'caught', 'paper', 'shredder', 'course', 'good', 'guys', 'win', 'end', 'make', 'take', 'did', 'Terry', 'time', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'are', 'good', 'guys', 'who', 'bad', 'guys', 'not', 'mention', 'ladies.Good', 'least', '1,000', 'laughs']",Jumpin' Jack Flash VHS

That self is very funny and very attractive, but again as with Williams, she tends to ride roughshod over the other actors in the film. That is a tribute to what a great star she is, still it would be interesting to see her in company with better supporting actors.That said, Jumpin' Jack Flash is really a hoot, perfect after a long day at the office or other unpleasant experience. Buy it, sit back, and enjoy! You will not be disappointed.Note: If you can find it, there's a wonderful MTV video floating around the Web of Whoopi banging a cab driver (played by Jim Belushi) over the head with a frying pan, running away with him in pursuit, and ducking into a building, slamming the door behind her. When she turns around, she's in a recording studio, where Keith Richards asks her if she's a backup singer. Of course she immediately becomes a backup singer, backing up Aretha Franklin who is recording ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" with Richards. Neither Franklin nor the Stones appear in the final version, but Franklin's version of ""Jumpin' Jack Flash,"" which is as good as the Stones', provides the backup to the credits at the end.",4,A One-Woman Show,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,1273,"['Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'got', 'start', 'standup', 'comedian', 'Williams', 'basically', 'repeatedly', 'films', 'self', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'attractive', 'again', 'Williams', 'ride', 'roughshod', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'tribute', 'what', 'great', 'star', 'still', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'company', 'better', 'supporting', 'actors.That', 'said', 'Jumpin', 'Jack', 'Flash', 'really', 'hoot', 'perfect', 'long', 'day', 'office', 'other', 'unpleasant', 'experience', 'Buy', 'back', 'enjoy', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.Note', 'can', 'find', 'wonderful', 'MTV', 'video', 'floating', 'Web', 'Whoopi', 'banging', 'cab', 'driver', 'played', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'head', 'frying', 'pan', 'running', 'away', 'pursuit', 'ducking', 'building', 'slamming', 'door', 'When', 'around', 'recording', 'studio', 'where', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'backup', 'singer', 'course', 'immediately', 'backup', 'singer', 'backing', 'up', 'Aretha', 'Franklin', 'who', 'recording', 'Jumpin', 'Jack', 'Flash', 'Richards', 'Neither', 'Franklin', 'Stones', 'appear', 'final', 'version', 'Franklin', 'version', 'Jumpin', 'Jack', 'Flash', 'as', 'good', 'Stones', 'backup', 'credits', 'end']",Jumpin' Jack Flash VHS

Whoopi Goldberg made the best of it but unless you're a fan they made a mess out of this film. Part of the problem was should it be a comedy or drama? Comedy is okay. John Huston changed Beat the Devil from suspense to comedy but it was a well written film. Jack Flash also possesses a good storyline but it became The Whoopi Goldberg Show and drifted into slapstick on occasion to kill time. She needed help on this film from the supporting characters. So the film bcame the show. It was also a lost opportunity but it was made at an awkward time. Only white folks could be American heroes. They could barely be leading characters. She took a few steps towards trashing that idea with Jack Flash. She could have taken a few more but the hesitation may have been due to concern over her acting capabilities if the film drifted toward drama and suspense. So why bother. Take what you have and forget the rest. At the time it was a wise decision. Still I hope that somebody will redo the film. There may be no KGB but the world is still quite dangerous. Hacking has grown quite common and somebody, establishing a back line of communications in this situation, doesn't sound unfeasible.

371895,A2DO1IA1F3N8B6,6303394035,R. Christman,"[3, 4]","'Jumpin Jack Flash' is about an unconventional woman named Terry Dolittle (Whoopi Goldberg) who loves movies and music but most importantly, helping people. Terry works at a bank transferring funds and while she enjoys her job her boss is very ""by the book"", he prefers Terry's responses to international clients be brief whereas Terry goes above and beyond to help. Terry is tested and gives into temptation when she's contacted by ""Jack"" who turns Terry's seemingly boring life into a crazy cat and mouse game of espionage.I just recently saw this movie for the very first time and I have to say that it was the perfect vehicle for Whoopi to showcase her many talents on screen. She's funny, she's relatable and you root for her. There's a lot of physical comedy mixed with dead-pan humor. I didn't know what to expect when I watched this but I'm glad I took the plunge. The movie is also part romantic comedy so there's a little something for everyone. I also feel that this movie is ahead of its time with the early internet use and communication.This is where I might come into some trouble. I hope nobody takes it the wrong way but I can't help but wonder if Nora Ephron took inspiration from this movie when she made 'Sleepless In Seattle' and 'You've Got Mail' (which is just a remake of 'Sleepless' if you ask me). Both movies are about two people who've never met but interact with each other and wind up together in the end. I don't understand the bad reviews and ratings I've seen for this film and such high ratings for those two made by Ephron. I also know that I can't be the only person to have made the connection. I'm not trying to knock Nora Ephron, especially since she just passed away and she's not here to defend herself but I can't help but wonder. I'm not saying she isn't talented but I find the women in her films to be more whiney and annoying than smart and intelligent. They seem to be recycled characters that take themselves too seriously. Penny Marshall directed 'Jumpin Jack Flash' and I find the women in her movies to be much stronger and likeable. This is just my opinion though so I'll leave it at that. I sincerely hope I didn't offend anyone.I can't believe the DVD cover art for this film. They should've used the original poster. It looks like they took a recent photo of Whoopi and edited out the small amount of gray in her dreads and they also used a current photo of Lower Manhattan and the problem is, if you went a little further to the left it would've been a photo of Lower Manhattan without the twin towers. That makes no sense since the towers are clearly visible in the film and existed in 1986. It looks like they tried to have it both ways and just started the skyline to the right of where the towers would've been. Any New Yorker would know this and recognize the obvious.
