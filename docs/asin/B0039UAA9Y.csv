Racy, raunchy, real, passionate, gritty.And Earl - you gotta love him - he presents God in a new way.Incredible acting, writing, directing, and a wonderful supporting cast and guest appearances.I watched the entire series on dvd and then purchased the show because it is so great.This strong woman character doesn't take the easy way to exercise life's demons, and still, she has a heart that doesn't stop - this is not a fluff piece - it's a get down into the dregs of your soul kind of show.And, for the record, don't be turned off because God and Angel's are talked about, this is only part of the show.Wonderful risky writing and directing.Thank you for this great show.",5,netever,1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,710,"['Holly', 'Hunter', 'what', 'daring', 'roll', 'Racy', 'raunchy', 'real', 'passionate', 'gritty.And', 'Earl', 'got', 'ta', 'God', 'new', 'way.Incredible', 'acting', 'writing', 'directing', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'cast', 'guest', 'appearances.I', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'dvd', 'then', 'purchased', 'show', 'so', 'great.This', 'strong', 'woman', 'character', ""n't"", 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'exercise', 'life', 'demons', 'still', 'heart', ""n't"", 'stop', 'not', 'fluff', 'piece', 'get', 'down', 'dregs', 'soul', 'kind', 'show.And', 'record', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'God', 'Angel', 'are', 'talked', 'only', 'part', 'show.Wonderful', 'risky', 'writing', 'directing.Thank', 'great', 'show']",N/A

It Had a High Rating Even When TNT Kept Bouncing the Time around and and Spliting up the season, they Might show 2-3 shows, then wait a Month or 2 before ending the Season, But Bottom Line TNT HAD A HIT SHOW. SO To Me The Show should have a 10 Star Rating, But Sad to Say they Only Go as High as 5 Star. The Cast was GREAT!

It's lighthearted at times, and far darker than most TV fare has been before or since.  Holly Hunter is outstanding as a morally compromised cop with issues too numerous to mention.  Her portrayal of this character is stellar, and worthy of more recognition than she ever got while it was on the air.I won't go into the story line much here, but I will say that this entire series is one you won't want to miss, a unique story told by talented writers, brought to life by excellent actors (you've never seen Leon Rippy this good, ever) and filmed at times like you are watching events with your own eyes.  This is the best camera work I've ever seen in a TV series, and the omission of a steady-cam in some scenes makes the action more realistic, without being overdone (like the barely-watchable and highly confusing Cloverfield).Don't miss this, it's well worth your valuable time.",5,Not for the fainthearted,1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,963,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'loved', 'show', 'think', 'was', 'here', 'gone', 'far', 'too', 'quickly', 'lighthearted', 'times', 'far', 'darker', 'most', 'TV', 'fare', 'been', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'outstanding', 'morally', 'compromised', 'cop', 'issues', 'too', 'numerous', 'mention', 'portrayal', 'character', 'stellar', 'worthy', 'more', 'recognition', 'ever', 'got', 'was', 'air.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'story', 'line', 'much', 'here', 'will', 'say', 'entire', 'series', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'unique', 'story', 'told', 'talented', 'writers', 'brought', 'life', 'excellent', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Leon', 'Rippy', 'good', 'ever', 'filmed', 'times', 'are', 'watching', 'events', 'own', 'eyes', 'best', 'camera', 'work', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'series', 'omission', 'steady-cam', 'scenes', 'action', 'more', 'realistic', 'being', 'overdone', 'barely-watchable', 'highly', 'confusing', 'Cloverfield', '.Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'well', 'worth', 'valuable', 'time']",N/A
