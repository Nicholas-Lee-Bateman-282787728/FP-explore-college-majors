169408,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,1404996087,A. Gammill,"[6, 8]","I believe one of the reasons the Dark Shadows revival series failed to thrive is that it aired Friday nights on NBC.  As far back as the original Star Trek, Friday night has been a death sentence for genre television.  I think the show might have had a fighting chance on Fox or as a first-run syndication show.Of course, it didn't last.  And that's a shame, because it was an excellent updating of the classic gothic soap opera.  Ben Cross was reportedly reluctant to play the vampire, but you'd never know it from watching him in action.  His scenes with Willie Loomis (the wonderful Jim Fyfe...whatever happened to that guy?) are among the best writing/acting EVER seen on network t.v.  I know one common complaint about the revival is that it rushed through some of the classic plotlines.  But I for one was looking forward to getting PAST all the familiar stories and into some fresh material.  Alas, it was never to happen.Perhaps Dark Shadows will yet again be ressurected.  Until then, this is an all-too-brief but satisfying return to Collinwood.",5,Excellent revival...but it should never have been on NBC,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,1055,"['believe', 'one', 'reasons', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'revival', 'series', 'failed', 'thrive', 'aired', 'Friday', 'nights', 'NBC', 'far', 'back', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Friday', 'night', 'been', 'death', 'sentence', 'genre', 'television', 'think', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'fighting', 'chance', 'Fox', 'first-run', 'syndication', 'show.Of', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'shame', 'was', 'excellent', 'updating', 'classic', 'gothic', 'soap', 'opera', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'was', 'reportedly', 'reluctant', 'play', 'vampire', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'watching', 'action', 'scenes', 'Willie', 'Loomis', 'wonderful', 'Jim', 'Fyfe', 'happened', 'guy', 'are', 'best', 'writing/acting', 'EVER', 'seen', 'network', 't.v', 'know', 'one', 'common', 'complaint', 'revival', 'rushed', 'classic', 'plotlines', 'one', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'getting', 'PAST', 'familiar', 'stories', 'fresh', 'material', 'Alas', 'was', 'never', 'happen.Perhaps', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'will', 'yet', 'again', 'be', 'ressurected', 'then', 'all-too-brief', 'satisfying', 'return', 'Collinwood']",N/A
169409,A28MYC8KKCK2FZ,1404996087,Alice L. Moore,"[1, 2]","This is a 1991 revival of the 60's soap opera, ""Dark Shadows"".  This is not a retooled series like ""Battlestar Galactica"".  The new ""Dark Shadows"" stays faithful to the series.  Some characters, however, have been merged into one player.  The special effects are better(I could have sworn they had a plastic bat for old times sake, though).  Fans will like the faithful and enhanced reproduction of the Collinwood sets.What I liked:  This was part of a $19.99 Double TV series pack with ""Dark Angel""Dark Angel - The Complete First Season.  I bought this at Target.  I've had many hours of viewing enjoyment with this twofer set.  The DVD set was a great buy.The actors, Ben Cross and Jean Simmons were excellent in their respective roles as Barnabas Collins and Elizabeth Collins Stoddard.  This in no way takes away from Jonathan Frid and Joan Bennett.  You can like both sets of actors at the same time.  Ben Cross brought out the moodiness and anguish of Barnabas.  You just wouldn't want to work for this guy; just ask his Renfield-like associate Willy Loomis(also done well in the new series).  They even added some Maine culture.Unlike many DVD sets there are very few previews/special features.  This is neutral for myself.  The merging of two characters into one is mixed as well.  The character of Angelique seemed diminished in this series.  In the Original Series she had that ""Fatal Attraction""Fatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition)quality and beyond.  You know getting even with Barnabas forever and selling her soul to the Devil.  This is not a slight on the actress.  She probably had to play the part as directed by TPTB.  It may have been planned that way  to avoid the other ingenue actresses being reduced to ciphers.Overall, this DVD set is a great value for the money.",4,Good Revival,1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,1797,"['1991', 'revival', '60', 'soap', 'opera', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'not', 'retooled', 'series', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'new', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'faithful', 'series', 'characters', 'however', 'have', 'been', 'merged', 'one', 'player', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'sworn', 'had', 'plastic', 'bat', 'old', 'times', 'sake', 'though', 'Fans', 'will', 'like', 'faithful', 'enhanced', 'reproduction', 'Collinwood', 'sets.What', 'liked', 'was', 'part', '19.99', 'Double', 'TV', 'series', 'pack', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'bought', 'Target', ""'ve"", 'had', 'many', 'hours', 'viewing', 'enjoyment', 'twofer', 'set', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'great', 'buy.The', 'actors', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'Jean', 'Simmons', 'were', 'excellent', 'respective', 'roles', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'Elizabeth', 'Collins', 'Stoddard', 'way', 'away', 'Jonathan', 'Frid', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'can', 'like', 'sets', 'actors', 'same', 'time', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'brought', 'out', 'moodiness', 'anguish', 'Barnabas', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'work', 'guy', 'just', 'ask', 'Renfield-like', 'associate', 'Willy', 'Loomis', 'also', 'done', 'well', 'new', 'series', 'even', 'added', 'Maine', 'culture.Unlike', 'many', 'DVD', 'sets', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'previews/special', 'features', 'neutral', 'merging', 'two', 'characters', 'one', 'mixed', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'Angelique', 'seemed', 'diminished', 'series', 'Original', 'Series', 'had', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Fatal', 'Attraction', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'quality', 'know', 'getting', 'even', 'Barnabas', 'forever', 'selling', 'soul', 'Devil', 'not', 'slight', 'actress', 'probably', 'had', 'play', 'part', 'directed', 'TPTB', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'planned', 'way', 'avoid', 'other', 'ingenue', 'actresses', 'being', 'reduced', 'ciphers.Overall', 'DVD', 'set', 'great', 'value', 'money']",N/A

I love Dark Shadows so much that it broke my heart when the House of Frankenstein Horror Wax Museum in Lake George cut the Dark Shadows theme song from their soundtrack. It used to play at the end as you're leaving.  And now it's gone.I enjoy the short lived 1990s version of Dark Shadows very much but they seriously dropped the ball with the transfer to DVD.1.  The video is forced into widescreen format when it wasn't filmed in widescreen, clearly distorting the images and forcing awkward visual cuts.2.  I'm certain this has been discussed before but WHO was stupid enough to leave in the unfiltered day for night scenes? It blows the schene when characters are talking about how the night looks and a classical style vampire is walking around in obvious sunlight. Why was this done right on the VHS tapes but not the DVDs?I think this DVD needs to be re-released with the corrected content.  It becomes very apparent that the distributor does NOT care abut the content when scenes that are necessary to be set during the night look like mid-day.  It's very distracting.The actual episodes are great so I give this four stars for that.

I think fans of oroginal shows should enter these realms of remakes with an open mind.....I did...and grew to absolutely love this show in its own right. Still maintaining my love of the original....I do not compare them for it wouldn't be fair to either entity....both were great in their own right. This new revival only lasted 12 episodes which was unfortunate...it would have been great if it had gone on past the original storylines so each actor could have fleshed out their roles even more. The storyline in this venture follows the basic storyline of a troubled Maine wealthy clan...the Collins family...led by matriarch, Elizabeth Collins-Stoddard (played well by veteran actress Jean Simmons....in the original, actress Joan Bennett very capably handled the role) and troubled brother Roger Collins (played by the Invaders, Roy Thinnes) with troubled son, David (3rd Rocks' own Joseph Gordon-Levitt) in tow. Elizabeth has hired a young ingenue, Victoria Winters (the beautiful Joanna Going) from New York as governess to troubled David, the story begins with her arrival as in the original. Victoria has an alterior motive for taking the job, she was an orphan, never knowing her origins, but has learned she has a benefactor from Maine who has been sending monies for her benefit over the years...she hopes to learn if there is a connection between her and the mysterious Collins family also from Collinsport, Maine. Coinciding with Victoria's arrival, greedy half-crazed opportunistic Collinwood caretaker Willie Loomis (outlandishly, yet humorously played to the hilt by Jim Fyfe) has found what he thinks is a treasure map to the Collins cemetery where as fate would have it, unwittingly unleashes the evil 75 year old vampire, Barnabas Collins ( played fantastically by Chariots of Fire's Ben Cross) who comes to the ancestral home claiming to be a cousin from England who, upon the family's agreement, begins restructure of the orginal family's home, the Old House....other pivotal characters include Elizabeth's erant daughter, Carolyn (Barbara Blackburn), Dr Hoffman (Barbara Steele), Dr Woodard (Stephan Gierarsh) Angelique (Lizette Anthony) Joe Haskell (Pretender's Michael T Weiss, the show's eye-candy,)Ely Pouget as psychic Maggie Evans and Michael Cavanaugh as the Sheriff.....as in the original the show re-uses cast members as Victoria, in one pivotal episode is dramatically thrust into the past during a fateful seance, only to find herself in 1790 Collinsport when barnabas is a mere mortal and lives in the house as the governess....mayhem ensues and we, the viewers, learn the backstory of how Barnabas' vampirism began....tales of madness, murder, itchcraft and zombies ensueand Victoria is set up to take the fall of witchcraft in a time when witch hunts were prevolent.....as Victoria is set to be hanged for witchcraft, the family in the 1790s and the present struggle to get her back where she belongs! Great thriller even for those who have never seen the origianl...sadly the story ends with one hell of a cliffhanger...those who know the original tale can fill in the blanks!!

Some things were changed from the original which disappointed me, such as, they made the house too ""BRIGHT!""  To me, the forboding house was critical to the story.  Maggie has psychic powers and has an affair with Roger Collins.  Boy, was that was a mistake!  Since I had bought the dvd, I decided to see it to the end.  It grew on me enough to recommend buying it.  In the end, I thought that it was okay.  I just can't rave about it like some of the other reviewers. It has a very good cast with notable stars like Jean Simmons and Roy Thinnes, and of course, Ben Cross.  I like Ben Cross a lot, but I still think that Jonathan Frid was better as Barnabas.

169417,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,1404996087,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[1, 1]","Dark Shadows where a rather unique soap opera which had it's glory days TV in the 1960's and early 1970's. The show was unique in that it mixed Gothic horror with drama and soap. In 1991 12 episodes which recreated a few of the major storylines from the original Dark Shadows where made, it is known as Dark Shadows: The Revival Series. I have fond memories of this series as a child, it was one of the first horror movies and TV series my mother allowed me to watch and I remember that I eagerly awaited each episode every week. Dark Shadows: The Revival Series just have all the charm of the 1950's Hammer horror movies, but with more modern special effects. The misty landscapes of Collinsworth and all the colorful characters just bring the world of this show alive.The premise of Dark Shadows: The Revival Series is that a rich family living in a made up American (I think it is American) town called Collinsworth hires a governess for their unruly young son. This governess is a young woman named Victoria Winters and she is the main character of the show. There are however several other good and interesting characters, from the members of the Collins family and their servants to the various townsfolk, and off course Barnabas Collins the perhaps most memorable character off all. In the first episode one of the Collin's servants accidentally wakes up a centuries old vampire, an ancestor of the Collins family Barnabas. After this things go to hell in a hand basket for the little community. People are murdered, girls are turned into vampires and...well I will not spoil it for you. The main focus however is the love affair between Barnabas and Victoria. The storyline of this show is just great and I enjoyed it just as much when I as an adult got it on DVD and watched it as when I was a little girl. The only gripe I have with this show is that after 12 episodes it just stop, there is no real ending and it feels like there should be more to the story, but it just cuts of, that is a little bit annoying, but other than that the story is great.Dark Shadows: The Revival Series runs like one long story, there is a theme to each episode, but if you begin to watch episode, let us say 5, then you will have a problem catching up. I like this, there is enough of a conclusion to each episode to make you feel like you have watched something complete, however the show also takes advantage of the series format and creates a longer story than they could have in a movie. The phasing in the show is great, the costumes, in both time periods (yes there is time travel in here) is wonderful. Dark Shadows: The Revival Series is just all around a great show which deserves a place in any horror or soap fan's DVD collection. One note here is that while it is called a horror soap there is not really that much horror, yes pepole get killed and vampires get staked and there is allot of supernatural stuff going on, but the show is not to bloody and not really scary, remember my mother let me watch this when I was a child.Dark Shadows: The Revival Series is a good example of a remake done right. It have kept all the good parts of the old TV show and then added the special effects which was possible in 1991. Do this mean that the original Dark Shadows series is not worth watching now that we have this one, no, there is always something special about the original, but this show do have allot of good elements and it allow you to get a more modern view of the Dark Shadows story. I give this show 9 out of 10, the abrupt ending takes away the stop score, but all in all this is a great show and I really can not recommend it enough.",4,Great show this is how a remake should be done!,1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,3646,"['Dark', 'Shadows', 'where', 'rather', 'unique', 'soap', 'opera', 'had', 'glory', 'days', 'TV', '1960', 'early', '1970', 'show', 'was', 'unique', 'mixed', 'Gothic', 'horror', 'drama', 'soap', '1991', '12', 'episodes', 'recreated', 'few', 'major', 'storylines', 'original', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'where', 'made', 'known', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'Revival', 'Series', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'series', 'child', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'horror', 'movies', 'TV', 'series', 'mother', 'allowed', 'watch', 'remember', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'episode', 'week', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'Revival', 'Series', 'just', 'have', 'charm', '1950', 'Hammer', 'horror', 'movies', 'more', 'modern', 'special', 'effects', 'misty', 'landscapes', 'Collinsworth', 'colorful', 'characters', 'just', 'bring', 'world', 'show', 'premise', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'Revival', 'Series', 'rich', 'family', 'living', 'made', 'up', 'American', 'think', 'American', 'town', 'called', 'Collinsworth', 'governess', 'unruly', 'young', 'son', 'governess', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Victoria', 'Winters', 'main', 'character', 'show', 'are', 'however', 'several', 'other', 'good', 'interesting', 'characters', 'members', 'Collins', 'family', 'servants', 'various', 'townsfolk', 'course', 'Barnabas', 'perhaps', 'most', 'memorable', 'character', 'first', 'episode', 'one', 'Collin', 'servants', 'accidentally', 'wakes', 'up', 'centuries', 'old', 'vampire', 'ancestor', 'Collins', 'family', 'Barnabas', 'things', 'go', 'hell', 'hand', 'basket', 'little', 'community', 'People', 'are', 'murdered', 'girls', 'are', 'turned', 'vampires', 'well', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'main', 'focus', 'however', 'love', 'affair', 'Barnabas', 'Victoria', 'storyline', 'show', 'just', 'great', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'when', 'adult', 'got', 'DVD', 'watched', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'only', 'gripe', 'have', 'show', '12', 'episodes', 'just', 'stop', 'real', 'ending', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'story', 'just', 'cuts', 'little', 'bit', 'annoying', 'other', 'story', 'great.Dark', 'Shadows', 'Revival', 'Series', 'one', 'long', 'story', 'theme', 'episode', 'begin', 'watch', 'episode', 'let', 'say', '5', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'catching', 'up', 'enough', 'conclusion', 'episode', 'make', 'feel', 'have', 'watched', 'something', 'complete', 'however', 'show', 'also', 'advantage', 'series', 'format', 'longer', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'movie', 'phasing', 'show', 'great', 'costumes', 'time', 'periods', 'yes', 'time', 'travel', 'here', 'wonderful', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'Revival', 'Series', 'just', 'great', 'show', 'place', 'horror', 'soap', 'fan', 'DVD', 'collection', 'One', 'note', 'here', 'called', 'horror', 'soap', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'horror', 'yes', 'pepole', 'get', 'killed', 'vampires', 'get', 'staked', 'allot', 'supernatural', 'stuff', 'going', 'show', 'not', 'bloody', 'not', 'really', 'scary', 'remember', 'mother', 'let', 'watch', 'when', 'was', 'child.Dark', 'Revival', 'Series', 'good', 'example', 'remake', 'done', 'right', 'have', 'kept', 'good', 'parts', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'then', 'added', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'possible', '1991', 'Do', 'mean', 'original', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'series', 'not', 'worth', 'watching', 'now', 'have', 'one', 'always', 'something', 'special', 'original', 'show', 'do', 'have', 'allot', 'good', 'elements', 'allow', 'get', 'more', 'modern', 'view', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'story', 'give', 'show', '9', '10', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'away', 'stop', 'score', 'great', 'show', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'enough']",N/A

There is a lot going on in these twelve episodes, and it's a fun escape. You can't help but sympathize with the vampire who wants to be free from his curse and live a mortal life.The cast is very good, particularly Ben Cross as Barnabas. Familiar faces abound.Interestingly, Barbara Steele of 1960s b-movie infamy (playing Dr. Hoffman in this series) seems almost unable to open her mouth; she speaks through closed jaws.

Amazing!)preparing Vicky's bedroom; two blondes walk in, with one personality between them.Who's who? Did they compete for the Carolyn part, which neither of them are.Roger isn't quite the spoiled and snobbish rich guy we have come to know and love.Willie Loomis, (help) is ah..challanged, in every sence of the word, but he makes up for it by being loud.The original character,(both actors), was disturbed...but not stupid; I don't think this guy could read a bookleast gleen and interpret the facts from old books to be at the door of the tomb(within 15 minutes of the beginning). Quick! when is he going to get bitten! It's got to be an improvement.Oh Yeah, Sam is the bartender. Com'oooonnnn.Why do I get the feeling there is one personality between most of the characters (not Willie Loomis...he's different.) and they are in competition to see who can do it the worst.The one possible excuse for this could be this is probably the pilot and they had to sell the idea to the networkso they couldn't take the time for slow developement but had to treat it like a movie.But that wouldn't account for the bad casting like ""somebody knew somebody"" and they tryed to please everybody;And play the parts like they are all freinds that know each other;that's lack of directing. (like ""Halloween V"", lol)and he could have stuck to the general outline of the original story,if not the details. (Just as well he didn't since it didn't last)I'm probably doing this too soon and have some of the characters wrong.Maybe it will get better and I can change my review. :)Oh yes, the cropping; it does look a little squashed sometimes;(I actually would not have noticed if it hadn't been pointed outbut I should have; much of the whole view is missing, like the top of theie head.)On the plus side, it has great sets, real or otherwise, good camera angles/special effects(Is that a real aerial view of the house?).and the music is certainly an improvement.This is just comparing two different animals but I must admit...this is starting to look...like a more sophisticated animal.Unfortunately, that is also more realistic therefore more disgusting...especially that Trask garbage.The one important thing wrong with this is they ruin the story;it had potential, it did come close sometimes.Added Note: Dan Curtis was on the right track, to make the overall effect what we always imagined; more elaborate cinematography and I can understand the time element in a weekly series not being enough to develope the story as on a soap opera, but he messed up the characters way too much;He did manage to show the vulnerable side of Barnabas in the ghost of Sarah.Like I said sometimes he came close. Maybe it was bad writers.(And...I like that I can see the night scenes...after all...Collinsport always has a full moon.)(Oh, I get it, right, dimmer ""moon light"" would have been better.)",3,The Best Barnabas Story Entry (non-soap opera),1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,3219,"['Yes', 'already', 'very', 'beginning.When', 'saw', 'train', 'Victoria', 'Winters', 'got', 'hopes', 'up.I', 'took', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'word', 'interview', 'end', 'Collection', '24', 'vindictive', 'Burke', 'Devlin', 'story', 'line', 'well', 'suppose', 'asking', 'too', 'soap', 'opera', 'series', 'transfer.Next', 'scene', 'Mrs.', 'Stoddard', 'Mrs.', 'Johnson', 'got', 'right-on', 'Amazing', 'preparing', 'Vicky', 'bedroom', 'two', 'blondes', 'walk', 'one', 'personality', 'them.Who', 'who', 'Did', 'compete', 'Carolyn', 'part', 'are.Roger', ""n't"", 'quite', 'spoiled', 'snobbish', 'rich', 'guy', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'love.Willie', 'Loomis', 'help', 'ah..challanged', 'sence', 'word', 'up', 'being', 'loud.The', 'original', 'character', 'actors', 'was', 'disturbed', 'not', 'stupid', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'guy', 'could', 'read', 'bookleast', 'gleen', 'interpret', 'facts', 'old', 'books', 'be', 'door', 'tomb', '15', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'Quick', 'when', 'going', 'get', 'bitten', 'got', 'be', 'improvement.Oh', 'Yeah', 'Sam', 'bartender', ""Com'oooonnnn.Why"", 'do', 'get', 'feeling', 'one', 'personality', 'most', 'characters', 'not', 'Willie', 'Loomis', 'different', 'are', 'competition', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'worst.The', 'one', 'possible', 'excuse', 'could', 'be', 'probably', 'pilot', 'had', 'sell', 'idea', 'networkso', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'slow', 'developement', 'had', 'treat', 'movie.But', 'would', ""n't"", 'account', 'bad', 'casting', 'somebody', 'knew', 'somebody', 'tryed', 'please', 'everybody', 'play', 'parts', 'are', 'freinds', 'know', 'other', 'lack', 'directing', 'Halloween', 'V', 'lol', 'could', 'have', 'stuck', 'general', 'outline', 'original', 'story', 'not', 'details', 'Just', 'as', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'last', ""'m"", 'probably', 'doing', 'too', 'soon', 'have', 'characters', 'wrong.Maybe', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'can', 'change', 'review', 'Oh', 'yes', 'cropping', 'look', 'little', 'squashed', 'sometimes', 'actually', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'noticed', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'pointed', 'should', 'have', 'much', 'whole', 'view', 'missing', 'top', 'theie', 'head', 'plus', 'side', 'great', 'sets', 'real', 'otherwise', 'good', 'camera', 'angles/special', 'effects', 'real', 'aerial', 'view', 'house', '.and', 'music', 'certainly', 'improvement.This', 'just', 'comparing', 'two', 'different', 'animals', 'must', 'admit', 'starting', 'look', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'animal.Unfortunately', 'also', 'more', 'realistic', 'therefore', 'more', 'disgusting', 'especially', 'Trask', 'garbage.The', 'one', 'important', 'thing', 'wrong', 'ruin', 'story', 'had', 'potential', 'did', 'come', 'close', 'sometimes.Added', 'Note', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'was', 'right', 'track', 'make', 'overall', 'effect', 'what', 'always', 'imagined', 'more', 'elaborate', 'cinematography', 'can', 'understand', 'time', 'element', 'weekly', 'series', 'not', 'being', 'enough', 'develope', 'story', 'soap', 'opera', 'messed', 'up', 'characters', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'did', 'manage', 'show', 'vulnerable', 'side', 'Barnabas', 'ghost', 'Sarah.Like', 'said', 'sometimes', 'came', 'close', 'Maybe', 'was', 'bad', 'writers', 'can', 'see', 'night', 'scenes', 'Collinsport', 'always', 'full', 'moon', 'Oh', 'get', 'right', 'moon', 'light', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better']",N/A

It seems many of the classic show, do not appreciate this remake.  But I have come to enjoy this stylish horror mini-series.Ben Cross is excellent as Barnabas Collins; and might I daresay that William Fyfe is a slightly better improvement on the Willie Loomis character.  Fyfe shines as Willie in this.  John Karlen was very good; but something about Fyfe outdoes the original, in this case.Cross brings something different to Barnabas Collins; and thus, a comparison between Mr Frid and Cross is not fair.  They are different; and I appreciate the difference in both cases.  Each one supplies a different nuance to the disturbing vampire.This series lacks any mistakes that have endeared the original to so many.  (The original being shot without almost not editing). This one is smooth and stylish; and very dark and heavily thick with the foggy atmosphere.  And Cross' ""Barnabas"" is equally dark throughout, with moments of revulsion at what he is.  After Frid became a success, and kept the goth opera alive, Curtis found it necessary to lighten his character somewhat.  Cross' characterization is not lightened in the least.It is in essence a meshing together of the movies ""House of Dark Shadows"" and the part of the soap opera that unleashed Barnabas Collins from his chained coffin through the trip of Victoria Winters back to the past of 1795, thus telling how Barnabas originally became a vampire.  Victoria returns, and the series ends!NBC sadly cancelled the show, despite good ratings (tho' how it maintained any ratings is perplexing as NBC was constantly interrupting the show due to the original Gulf War happening at the time).  They later told Curtis they regretted cancelling the show; and tried to bring it back.  But circumstances intervened, and the show remains what it is: a 12 part series, lavishly done with a retelling of many of the story plots of the original.  That is the one down side.The other is strange to be sure.  When MPI released the show on VHS, it had the missing scenes originally cut from the premiere.  The DVD collection does not.  It has great picture quality, but it is as aired on television.  No extras.Despite that, it is still worth obtaining. And it will likely be the last new thing you see of Dark Shadows (television/movie wise) for a very long time.Despite the faults of this edition, I still recommend it.  It was done with class,--the way Curtis originally envisioned the powerful, tho' decadent Collins family.Enjoy.IN CHRIST JESUS: THE LORD GOD INCARNATE!!!Braithwaite*(Gospel of John Ch. 1; Acts 4:12; Romans 10:9-10)*",4,Different but the Same . . .,1172016000,"02 21, 2007",2007,2786,"['stylish', 'remake', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'based', 'bizarre', 'classic', 'daytime', 'goth', 'opera', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'Jonathan', 'Frid', 'Grayson', 'Hall', 'etc', '.Only', '1991', 'remake', 'was', 'weekly', 'show', 'shown', 'primetime', 'many', 'classic', 'show', 'do', 'not', 'appreciate', 'remake', 'have', 'come', 'enjoy', 'stylish', 'horror', 'mini-series.Ben', 'Cross', 'excellent', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'might', 'daresay', 'William', 'Fyfe', 'slightly', 'better', 'improvement', 'Willie', 'Loomis', 'character', 'Fyfe', 'shines', 'Willie', 'John', 'Karlen', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'something', 'Fyfe', 'original', 'case.Cross', 'something', 'different', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'thus', 'comparison', 'Mr', 'Frid', 'Cross', 'not', 'fair', 'are', 'different', 'appreciate', 'difference', 'cases', 'one', 'different', 'nuance', 'disturbing', 'vampire.This', 'series', 'mistakes', 'have', 'endeared', 'original', 'so', 'many', 'original', 'being', 'shot', 'almost', 'not', 'editing', 'one', 'smooth', 'stylish', 'very', 'dark', 'heavily', 'thick', 'foggy', 'atmosphere', 'Cross', 'Barnabas', 'equally', 'dark', 'moments', 'revulsion', 'what', 'Frid', 'became', 'success', 'kept', 'goth', 'opera', 'alive', 'Curtis', 'found', 'necessary', 'lighten', 'character', 'somewhat', 'Cross', 'characterization', 'not', 'lightened', 'least.It', 'essence', 'meshing', 'together', 'movies', 'House', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'part', 'soap', 'opera', 'unleashed', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'chained', 'coffin', 'trip', 'Victoria', 'Winters', 'back', 'past', '1795', 'thus', 'telling', 'how', 'Barnabas', 'originally', 'became', 'vampire', 'Victoria', 'returns', 'series', 'NBC', 'sadly', 'cancelled', 'show', 'good', 'ratings', 'tho', 'how', 'maintained', 'ratings', 'perplexing', 'NBC', 'was', 'constantly', 'interrupting', 'show', 'due', 'original', 'Gulf', 'War', 'happening', 'time', 'later', 'told', 'Curtis', 'regretted', 'cancelling', 'show', 'tried', 'bring', 'back', 'circumstances', 'intervened', 'show', 'what', '12', 'part', 'series', 'lavishly', 'done', 'retelling', 'many', 'story', 'plots', 'original', 'one', 'side.The', 'other', 'strange', 'be', 'sure', 'When', 'MPI', 'released', 'show', 'VHS', 'had', 'missing', 'scenes', 'originally', 'cut', 'premiere', 'DVD', 'collection', 'not', 'great', 'picture', 'quality', 'as', 'aired', 'television', 'No', 'extras.Despite', 'still', 'worth', 'obtaining', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'last', 'new', 'thing', 'see', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'television/movie', 'wise', 'very', 'long', 'time.Despite', 'faults', 'edition', 'still', 'recommend', 'was', 'done', 'class', 'way', 'Curtis', 'originally', 'envisioned', 'powerful', 'tho', 'decadent', 'Collins', 'family.Enjoy.IN', 'CHRIST', 'JESUS', 'LORD', 'GOD', 'INCARNATE', 'Braithwaite*', 'Gospel', 'John', 'Ch', '1', '4:12', 'Romans', '10:9-10', '*']",N/A

This is very simply a ""must-own"" title for any ""Dark Shadows"" fan.The main point of discussion I wish to address here, however, is in regard to all the people who are attacking the picture quality of this release. Friends, there is nothing at all wrong with this transfer. I can say that because I recorded each and every one of these twelve episodes way back in the day when they initially aired. The DVDs, if anything, provide a far more sharper and respectable presentation than what remains on my aging videotapes. These episodes look the way they do because that is very simply the manner in which they were shot.And what is with all this nonsensical backlash about the widescreen treatment? There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with it! Not a single solitary thing! Reading these reviews, I was very nearly tricked into believing this set was nothing more than one big disappointment. Having recently taken home a rental copy for my own inspection, I can now honestly say that all those panning reviews are way off the mark.I do agree with those who feel this series deserved a longer run. This revival possessed a quality that most others today unfortunately don't, and that's class. From top to bottom, this was a lavishly staged production. Dan Curtis remains as much a storytelling genius here as he ever was.

It led to me chasing a lot of little girls around with plastic Vampire teeth and 'biting necks'.  So I was excited to see the new series  arrive in TV land again to bring back those memories of a simpler time. And what's more I actually liked the actors and storyline.Sadly I was in the minority because the series ended with one season. A shame to because the storyline was JUST getting to some of the good stuff... well good as far as what counts as 'good stuff' in the Dark Shadows world.The story centers around this 'old money' family and the supernatural things that go on around them. You have a vampire, witch, time travel, and a medium contacting the dead... lets not forget the ghost sister that likes to haunt Barnabas(the Vampire) and sort of act as his spectral conscience.  Add in a cast of colorful other characters and you have the good mix that was Dark Shadows.And that's just the first season.

I decided to rent the set and watch all twelve episodes.Dark Shadows basically revolve around the lives of the Collins family.  They are an old, wealthy family.  Many of their generations have lived at the great estate, Collinwood.  The story begins with the accidental release of the immortal vampire, Barnabas Collins.  Soon after, Barnabas cleverly works his way back into the family circle, claiming to be his only remaining descendant, with the same name and uncanny appearance.  To further complicate matters, other strangers arrive at the quiet little town.  The most important new resident of Collinwood, next to Barnabas, is Ms. Victoria Winters.  A few episodes later, a very powerful evil being from the past awakens and puts the future of everyone at Collinwood in dangerAre you bored with sitcoms?

The series followed the basic plot of the original with Victoria Winters (played by Joanna Going) traveling on a train to Collinsport where she has taken a job as governess at the Collinwoods. She's really there to take care of David (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who claims to see ghosts at the ""old house."" While this is happening, Willie Loomis breaks into a crypt looking for jewels, but instead he releases the vampire cursed Barnabas Collins (played by Ben Cross).Barnabas makes Willie is servant. Then he quickly introduces himself to the Collins as a cousin from England, in which the family gives him the ""old house."" When Barnabas sees Victoria, he wonders if she is the reincarnation of his lost love Josette Du Pres. This here is a major change as in the original Maggie Evans was the look-alike for Josette. Barnabas peruses a relationship with Victoria.Barnabas is a vampire, so he does feed on the locals, which results in Dr. Julia Hoffman (played by Barbara Steele) learning of his blood sucking ways. She claims that she can cure him and mysteriously falls in love him.During a s&eacute;ance, Victoria Winters is sent back in time to the year 1790, where she poses at the governess. She meets the Barnabas before he was cursed, her double Josette, and the witch Angelique (played by Lysette Anthony). Before long, the Collins suspects that Victoria is a witch and they plan to hang her.The movie length pilot did well in ratings in 1991, but because of the first Gulf War coverage, the series got preempted and the ratings dropped. Thanks to the cult following, MGM released the series on DVD a few years ago. All thirteen episodes are available on the three DVD set.I remember the constant advertisements for the series when I was a kid. My parents let stay up to watch the two hour premiere. If I remember correctly, the episodes were shoved around because of the Gulf War. The series never really had a chance because of this. It's great that fans can get a chance to see the series in full, even though the last episode ended in somewhat of a cliffhanger. There are some problems/errors with the DVD. When the show was original filmed, they filmed some night scenes during the day and they would later alter the scenes during post-production. When MGM remastered the series for DVD, this was not taking into consideration; therefore we get a vampire walking in daylight.All the new actors fit perfectly into their roles, all accept for Jim Fyfe who played Willie Loomis, whose been altered to be a half-wit. I can't blame the actor as I'm sure he did his best. I blame the writers and producers for changing the character.Dark Shadows: The Revival isn't perfect, but it is a fun watch, and the DVD should satisfy most fans.",4,NBC Shouldn't Have Canceled It,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,2918,"['heavy', 'advertising', 'campaign', 'NBC', 'aired', 'reboot', '1966-1971', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'soap', 'opera', 'January', '1991', 'only', 'time', 'was', 'aired', 'primetime', 'instead', 'daytime', 'series', 'followed', 'basic', 'plot', 'original', 'Victoria', 'Winters', 'played', 'Joanna', 'Going', 'traveling', 'train', 'Collinsport', 'where', 'taken', 'job', 'governess', 'Collinwoods', 'really', 'there', 'take', 'care', 'David', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'who', 'see', 'ghosts', 'old', 'house', 'happening', 'Willie', 'Loomis', 'crypt', 'looking', 'jewels', 'instead', 'vampire', 'cursed', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'played', 'Ben', 'Cross', '.Barnabas', 'Willie', 'servant', 'Then', 'quickly', 'Collins', 'cousin', 'England', 'family', 'old', 'house', 'When', 'Barnabas', 'Victoria', 'reincarnation', 'lost', 'love', 'Josette', 'Du', 'Pres', 'here', 'major', 'change', 'original', 'Maggie', 'Evans', 'was', 'look-alike', 'Josette', 'Barnabas', 'relationship', 'Victoria.Barnabas', 'vampire', 'feed', 'locals', 'results', 'Dr.', 'Julia', 'Hoffman', 'played', 'Barbara', 'Steele', 'learning', 'blood', 'sucking', 'ways', 'can', 'cure', 'mysteriously', 'love', 'him.During', 's', 'eacute', 'ance', 'Victoria', 'Winters', 'sent', 'back', 'time', 'year', '1790', 'where', 'governess', 'Barnabas', 'was', 'cursed', 'double', 'Josette', 'witch', 'Angelique', 'played', 'Lysette', 'Anthony', 'long', 'Collins', 'Victoria', 'witch', 'plan', 'hang', 'her.The', 'movie', 'length', 'pilot', 'did', 'well', 'ratings', '1991', 'first', 'Gulf', 'War', 'coverage', 'series', 'got', 'preempted', 'ratings', 'dropped', 'Thanks', 'cult', 'following', 'MGM', 'released', 'series', 'DVD', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'are', 'available', 'three', 'DVD', 'set.I', 'remember', 'constant', 'advertisements', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'parents', 'let', 'stay', 'up', 'watch', 'two', 'hour', 'premiere', 'remember', 'correctly', 'episodes', 'were', 'shoved', 'Gulf', 'War', 'series', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'chance', 'great', 'fans', 'can', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'series', 'full', 'even', 'last', 'episode', 'ended', 'somewhat', 'cliffhanger', 'are', 'problems/errors', 'DVD', 'When', 'show', 'was', 'original', 'filmed', 'filmed', 'night', 'scenes', 'day', 'would', 'later', 'alter', 'scenes', 'post-production', 'When', 'MGM', 'remastered', 'series', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'taking', 'consideration', 'get', 'vampire', 'walking', 'daylight.All', 'new', 'actors', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'roles', 'accept', 'Jim', 'Fyfe', 'who', 'played', 'Willie', 'Loomis', 'been', 'altered', 'be', 'half-wit', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'actor', ""'m"", 'sure', 'did', 'best', 'blame', 'writers', 'producers', 'changing', 'character.Dark', 'Revival', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'fun', 'watch', 'DVD', 'should', 'satisfy', 'most', 'fans']",N/A

Hurriedly he and I woke the rest of the family as he explained that a favorite of his was coming back to TV. His favorite, the original Dark Shadows, very quickly became one of my favorites through this revival. My entire family watched the show religiously until much to our dismay, well before the story could receive any sense of closure, the revised and improved tale of Barnabus Collins was staked through the preverbal heart.Since then I have watched some of the old Dark Shadows trying to piece together the rest of the story, and pardon me for not having nostalgic feelings for the original I found the old series somewhat cheesy. Yes I am spoiled by modern effects, but it wasn't just that... the acting, the scripts, it became painfully obvious why Dan Curtis would want to re-write and re-make the series, and focus it more on Barnabus, considering the series was really not going anywhere until he arrived at Collinwood.Although the effects of the new Dark Shadows aren't up to today's standard what does hold up is the phenomenal acting (especially by Ben Cross, and Joanna Going, and Jim Fyfe.) The story is still as compelling today as it was more than a decade ago, and Ironically I now recognize Joseph-Gordon Leavitt not only as Tommy from 3rd Rock (the greatest TV comedy of all time) but also as the creepy kid from this revival series. I never realized that before picking up this collection! His acting, even at the age young age he was when Dark Shadows was filmed, was on par with modern day child prodigies like Freddy Highmore. Simply put, despite somewhat cheap looking effects, the story, the acting the moody atmosphere still absolutely hold up... sadly there is no end to this tale, no resolution. The twelfth episode goes by and leaves you begging for more knowing that it will never come because this series came and went so many years ago, and the actors who were in this series are now too old to reprise their roles for any sort of attempt at a revival.While I would love to have had this story finished I certainly do worry that any further attempts to revive this amazing series may end up on the WB with casting like the guy playing superman in Smallville as Barnabus Collins, and other questionable casting decisions like that that would reduce this beloved but ill-fated classic to a teeny-bopper status. I have heard rumblings that there may be such a revival in the works and I fear it more than I feared Angelique when I was a child.In short, definitely pick this up but be aware that it leaves you hanging pretty badly.",5,The best show they never finshed,1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,2716,"['When', 'was', 'eleven', 'years', 'old', 'father', 'excitedly', 'woke', 'sleep', 'announce', 'really', 'great', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'making', 'debute', 'night', 'Hurriedly', 'woke', 'rest', 'family', 'explained', 'favorite', 'was', 'coming', 'back', 'TV', 'favorite', 'original', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'very', 'quickly', 'became', 'one', 'favorites', 'revival', 'entire', 'family', 'watched', 'show', 'religiously', 'much', 'dismay', 'well', 'story', 'could', 'receive', 'sense', 'closure', 'revised', 'improved', 'tale', 'Barnabus', 'Collins', 'was', 'staked', 'preverbal', 'heart.Since', 'then', 'have', 'watched', 'old', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'trying', 'piece', 'together', 'rest', 'story', 'pardon', 'not', 'having', 'nostalgic', 'feelings', 'original', 'found', 'old', 'series', 'somewhat', 'cheesy', 'Yes', 'am', 'spoiled', 'modern', 'effects', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'acting', 'scripts', 'became', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'why', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'would', 'want', 're-write', 're-make', 'series', 'focus', 'more', 'Barnabus', 'considering', 'series', 'was', 'really', 'not', 'going', 'anywhere', 'arrived', 'Collinwood.Although', 'effects', 'new', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'are', ""n't"", 'up', 'today', 'standard', 'what', 'hold', 'up', 'phenomenal', 'acting', 'especially', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'Joanna', 'Going', 'Jim', 'Fyfe', 'story', 'still', 'compelling', 'today', 'was', 'more', 'decade', 'ago', 'Ironically', 'now', 'recognize', 'Joseph-Gordon', 'Leavitt', 'not', 'only', 'Tommy', '3rd', 'Rock', 'greatest', 'TV', 'comedy', 'time', 'also', 'creepy', 'kid', 'revival', 'series', 'never', 'realized', 'picking', 'up', 'collection', 'acting', 'even', 'age', 'young', 'age', 'was', 'when', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'was', 'filmed', 'was', 'par', 'modern', 'day', 'child', 'prodigies', 'Freddy', 'Highmore', 'Simply', 'put', 'somewhat', 'cheap', 'looking', 'effects', 'story', 'acting', 'moody', 'atmosphere', 'still', 'absolutely', 'hold', 'up', 'sadly', 'end', 'tale', 'resolution', 'twelfth', 'episode', 'leaves', 'begging', 'more', 'knowing', 'will', 'never', 'come', 'series', 'came', 'went', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'series', 'are', 'now', 'too', 'old', 'reprise', 'roles', 'sort', 'attempt', 'revival.While', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'had', 'story', 'finished', 'certainly', 'do', 'worry', 'further', 'attempts', 'revive', 'amazing', 'series', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'WB', 'casting', 'guy', 'playing', 'superman', 'Smallville', 'Barnabus', 'Collins', 'other', 'questionable', 'casting', 'decisions', 'would', 'reduce', 'beloved', 'ill-fated', 'classic', 'teeny-bopper', 'status', 'have', 'heard', 'rumblings', 'may', 'be', 'such', 'revival', 'works', 'fear', 'more', 'feared', 'Angelique', 'when', 'was', 'child.In', 'short', 'definitely', 'pick', 'up', 'be', 'aware', 'hanging', 'pretty', 'badly']",N/A

169438,AS18HUSD425L3,1404996087,DCSKL,"[0, 0]","As a lifelong fan of the first Dark Shadows, and it's two Theatrical versions, I was very excited indeed when Dan Curtis and NBC decided to revisit the concept in 1991.  Although borrowing characters and plot lines from the 1966-1971 Gothic Soap (as well as from the first theatrical film), this second edition often managed to present the material in  new ways.  This sometimes worked quite effectively, and sometimes not.  Technically, it was far superior to it's forerunner (no styrofoam tombstones, falling sets, or totally blown lines here). But those things were to be expected of the first Dark Shadows, as it was basically a live stage play done for television.  That's how Soaps were done back in the 60's. In fact, many long time fans of the show cherish those imperfections, they're part of the mystic of the classic show.The cinematography, music and set design of the 1991 reworking are quite good by television standards.  The casting had it's pluses and minuses.  Ben Cross does a good job of capturing the character of Barnabas (although I prefer the visual appearance and somewhat psychotic mannerisms of John Frid's portrayal).  Lysette Anthony brings beauty, talent and a touch of maniacal enjoyment to her portrayal of Angelique. For me the best of this cast is Joanna Going as Victoria Winters.  Through her obvious beauty and sincere delivery, she managed to capture the character of Victoria with ease.  Still, I wished for something better in the casting of Willie Loomis and Julia Hoffman.  John Karlen and Grayson Hall own  those characters, period!As for this particular DVD set, I just don't see what all the fuss is.  The packaging is nice, the sound is good and the picture quality is fine on my TV. As for the somewhat ""grainy"" or ""blurred"" appearance in some of the episodes that some reviewers have complained about, it looks to me like the sceanes were filmed that way on purpose for effect.

169445,A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO,1404996087,E. Hornaday,"[178, 189]","Dark Shadows: The Revial Series, a 1991 12-episode primetime remake of the 1966-1971 classic daytime gothic soap opera of the same name, deserves this full DVD release and I applaude MPI for providing it.Previously available from MPI on video only, it is a great move to provide it on DVD, as loyal Dark Shadows fans of both shows are eager for the release of all Dark Shadows material on DVD, as well as new fans just discovering the haunting original series or this revival.I grew up on the original when it was in its first run and cherish it to this day, having snapped up every DVD release. I do not love the remake, but I like it, and believe that others, as one reviewer has already stated, may prefer its handling of the material.Dark Shadows was created by Dan Curtis who also wrote and produced the revival series. Like the original, Curtis selected a stellar cast to bring his show ""back to life"" but with 1990 sensibilities.The original cast is among my favorite for ANY TV series including the brilliant Jonathan Frid as the guilt-ridden, 175-year-old Barnabas Collins.The original show aired more than 220 episodes and was on the verge of cancellation when the character of Barnabas was introduced. Originally written to be a transient villian only, Frid's haunting portrayal of the sensistive and eventually compassionate and all too-human immortal, saved the show and kept Frid busy for the rest of the series.While Barnabas was one key to the show, another was the ensemble nature of the series, which revolved around the Collins family and friends in the present, past and future. The classic movie actress Joan Bennett brought Elizabeth Collins Stoddard to life, and Louis Edmonds did the same for her character's brother, Roger Collins.Like the original series, the revival cast a great actor, Ben Cross (best known for his amazing performance in Chariots of Fire), to resurrect Barnabas, and another classic movie and TV actress, Jean Simmons, to portray Elizabeth. Noted soap opera and TV actor Roy Thinnes (star of the cult sensation The Invaders) is Roger in the revivial show.Focusing on the newly hired governess of Collinwood, (located in Collinsport, Maine) Victoria Winters (portrayed flawlessly in the orginal series by Alexandra Moltke and in a good performance by Joanna Going in the revival), the revival series introduces the main characters through her eyes as well as the mysterious mansion, and the Old House, where Barnabas returns to live.Ghosts, seances, vampires, witches, love, death, and the meaning of life are only a few of the unusual topics both series explored. Unfortunately, the revival series was put to rest after only 12 episodes. It would have been great to see how the cast explored their roles and if they were ever able to separate themselves from their better-known characters' forerunners.Like the original series, the secret of Barnabas Collins is unknown to the family, but is fiercely protected by Dr. Julia Hoffman, who finds out he is a creature of the night, then falls hopelessly in love with him. The original series was blessed with the unmatched acting talent of the magnificent Grayson Hall for this pivotal role, while the revival series relied on Barbara Steele to play the unrequited character, and who portrayed the character in a much darker fashion.Simmons' portrayal has a harder edge and is less sympathetic than the portrayal by Bennett, who brought an unmatched warmth and magnetism to Elizabeth, and for me, Cross overplays his role and is unable to bring the depth of feeling that Frid conveyed, and is therefore much less compelling.Nonetheless, many of the elements that made Dark Shadows a soap opera classic remain making the revival series well worth revisiting.Look for Michael T.

So I was really pleased to be able to buy the complete series on DVD. .I absolutely love Ben Cross as Barnabus Collins and find it quite amazing that he is able to convey a scary character by sheer acting ability without the aid of todays advanced special effects! Of course his lovely English accent and great speaking voice and unusual looks are a plus.  So I guesss one could say that he is perfectly cast. The story is more of the classic Vampire tale from years ago quite different to what is produced now.  Apparently the series was made in 1990/1991 and was affected by the Gulf War Crisis news coverage and therefore the showings were interrupted. There was definite room for continuation as the story didn't really finish and  was left without a proper end. (I wonder why they didn't continue filming at a later date?.)  Maybe the actors had gone on to other projects.  Anyhow, here is the complete series as it first appeared on television. So if a more traditional Vampire story is your thing with good acting and the great location of Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills then this will be perfect viewing.",5,Dark Shadows.

Certain cast members like Jean Simmons, Roy Thinnes, Joanna Going, Lysette Anthony and of course Ben Cross (even though he can't hold a cross [whoops did I say that?] to Jonathan Frid) do a good job, but with the original there were so many plots that get lost to modern viewers since this series tanked.  This version focuses mainly on the arrival of Vicki Winters, the resurrection of Barnabas and the 1790 (it originally was 1795) storyline.  Since this series was hour length rather than half hour (the first 2 episodes were actualy 2 hours), a lot more can be covered at one time.  It also allowed once the 1790 story started for actors to play both their roles in the same episode.  Alright it meant changing from post revolutionary war costumes back to modern garb in the same script, but like I said this series unlike it's ""daddy"" was hour length and also was NOT live on tape.  Also once Barnabas arrives, the show (in the present) plays more a remake like the box office movie ""House of Dark Shadows"" from 1970 (which purists will tell you the series version of the storyline used was much better).  I didn't think this set would hit DVD til after MPI went back and released the ""pre Barnabas"" era classic shows (which they started after set 26), but now that's it's scheduled for release I will say my opinion.  Buy this set ONLY if you want EVERYTHING Dark Shadows on DVD.  Realistically though, the classic series is far better, and you'd be better served buying that.  If the movies (House and Night of Dark Shadows) hit DVD (preferably as 1 double feature release), I will buy that, but as far as this series goes, stick with the 1966-1971 version.  As my favorite tv reference book says, ""Maybe a fad belongs to its time"".  Update: For the benefit of the person who used my name (and spelled properly too thank you for that), I have since went out and bought this set.  Ok, classic fans, go ahead and email me that I ""tainted my DVD library"". ;-).  By the way, I'll give it this, the picture quality of this copy looks better than it did on tv in 91 by a Collinwood mile.

They took a 4:3 picture and zoomed into just the center section which cropped the top and bottom.Two, the picture looks zoomed in. It looks as if every shot is a close-up of the actors. Much of the surrounding setting and mood has been cropped out of the scene. It looks strange. Some scenes even have the tops of the actors' heads cropped off.  I don't really think that this is what the directors had intended.Outside of those two limitations, this show is awesome. I remember seeing it in high school and loving every episode.

Mcelwain,"[0, 1]","Fans of the original Dark Shadows daytime series will find this prime-time revival interesting for its retelling of the early vampire story from the series and for its upgraded production values and optics.There are a few differences from the original in terms of plot and characters, but in general it follows the original pretty closely. Ben Cross does a nice job as Barnabas, the troubled and ferocious vampire seeking his long-lost love Josette, and terrorizing the town of Collinsport in the process. In addition to suspense and drama, the new series also has some genuine moments of pathos, which echo the original. One criticism I have is that, toward the end, the storytelling in the revival seems to become a bit over-complicated, as it attempts to tell two parallel stories simultaneously (one in 1991 and one in 1790) and the logic of some of the new plot elements begins to stretch thin. A more linear, more concise storyline might have worked better, in my view.Overall, I recommend this retelling of the Dark Shadows vampire story for original fans of the series and for horror fans in general, as they will appreciate the production values and the drama of the series.

Production values are more lavish, I have to say, but- interestingly- there are frequent examples of over-the-top, campy acting, never a big problem in the original series. Sadly, it's not until the final episodes of this revival when some new directions are introduced and genuine narrative traction takes place, but by then the show was cancelled.Image quality on these DVDs is a little disappointing, being slightly better than that of a decent VHS tape image.

Curtis has taken the best story arcs to begin (like the 70's film ""House of Dark Shadows"") the mini-series begins with Governess Victoria Winters arrival at the mysterious estate of Collinwood and continues shortly after with Barnabas' release.

One of the main characters goes through hell and then right at the moment the answers should be given to the audience... they roll credits. It was crazy!

For anyone who has not seen the old series of Dark Shadows the Revival Series only lasted a year and was about the vampire Barnabas Collins who came to Collinwood after being unchained from his coffin by handyman Willie Loomis. Barnabas Collins who lived in 1795 was cursed by a witch from Martinique called Angelique Boussaird. In the present Barnabas falls in love with Victoria Winters who is a spitting image of Josette Dupres Barnabas' fiance in the 18th century. Victoria Winters is played by Joanna Going. Ben Cross plays Barnabas and does the best portrayal of Barnabas Collins. The series was truly haunting and it was a pity the series only lasted a year. There are three discs in the case and over 10 hours of footage. The series starts with Vicky Winters taking a train to Collinwood. It ends with Vicky coming back from the 18th century. Jean Simmons(Spartacus) plays Mrs. Stoddard. I still loved Joan Bennett playing Elizabeth Collins Stoddard. Noone could have played the role like Bennett. The entire series focuses on Barnabas and Victoria. Willie was not quite as good as John Karlen on the old series and I liked Lara Parker better as Angelique. The back in time was more accurate with the period clothing, knee breeches and wigs on the revival.Carolyn like on the other series gets bitten by Barnabas and David was an O.K. character. Some things were changed from the original series.Daphne for instance is dating Joe and Maggie is dating Roger. The costuming on the back in time was wonderful but it was really short.I thought Ben Cross was a better Barnabas than Jonathan Frid. I wish that the series could have continued.

169473,A25F53TXHRHEVK,1404996087,lovehitzalot,"[17, 17]","I cannot describe the incredible joy when I saw that Dark Shadows the Revival Series was coming to dvd! There is simply nothing quite like this series! ""Reincarnated"" (forgive me :)) in 1991 by Dan Curtis, the creater of the original Dark Shadows, the revival series brought this wonderous tale of tragic romance, gothic myth, and the unforgettable Collins family to a new audience rekindled it for the existing fans in a remarkable new scale of grandeur and excellence! It's amazing to think that Dan Curtis literally drempt up the idea for Dark Shadows because the story has an epic quality about it that is shared by very few other tales.Dark Shadows is the story of an elegant family surrounded in tragedy throughout the centuries due in large part to the love of a servant girl named Angelique (Lysette Anthony) for the charming Barnabas Collins in the 1790s. Barnabas was engaged to and truly in love with Josette DuPres (Joanna Going), but had misled Angelique to believe he loved her. As a result, he now faces her wrath as a witch when, after her death, she curses him to be a vampire for all time. ""All who love you shall die!"" Remorsed with his terrible actions, Barnabas is soon chained in a coffin for 200 years and released again by accident in 1990. There, he meets Victoria Winters, the identical reincarnation of his love Josette and also a sensible Dr. Hoffman (Barbara Steele), who, after finding out his secret, has discovered a strange cell in his blood and is convinced she can cure him of his vampirism. But Angelique has plans of her own for all of them.Ben Cross plays the reluctant vampire Barnabas Collins cursed into existence, in his own words, ""..as melodramatically as the small screen would allow."" His sense of this character is tremendous and he plays it brilliantly using the perfect combination of old-world charm, warmth, conflicted horror over his actions mixed with rage over his inability to completely control himself, romance, and even humor (The strong presence in his comic timing is delightful to watch). The surrounding cast is equally incredible and I still get so excited every time I see their individual successes today! I wish I could list each one, but I must press on.The Dark Shadows Revival Series contained only 12 episodes and they're all showcased in this two-disc dvd set. The show premiered moments after the Gulf War had begun and never found a consistent time slot on NBC after that, so very few were able to see how well done the show was and the amazing potential that it had to be a phenomenal hit! At last, a gift to the fans has arrived in its Dvd release and it's a chance for those who never got to see Dark Shadows in the 90s to experience it.The dvd is presented in Widescreen with wonderful clarity. There are no special features to speak of, sadly :(, but there is still a Behind the Scenes VHS available on Amazon that includes interviews with Dan Curtis and all of the cast members (minus the youngest actors. :) I would have adored an interview from little Joseph Gordon Levitt and Veronica Lauren!), plus lots of behind the scenes footage, and many hysterical bloopers that are all definitely worth seeing! (despite the older format)Incase it's difficult to tell, I truly recommend this series!

I own all of the original Dark Shadows, including movies as well... And this revival hits on most all of the key points of that story (line). On top of which, if one listens to the ""extra"" footage upon those original airings of Dark Shadows.... Even the actors agree that it was a poorly filmed, and done show. Different from day to day, depending on which actors happened to be around for the airing (as Willy proclaims after the discs' in bonus footage/interviews). However, the revival series was masterfully done! Especially given the time in which it was conceived. The audio and video quality are fantastic! Although... being they are DVD -R (on demand so-to-speak), they would not play in my older DVD player... And thus, I had to play them in the newer one (big deal)! I could not wait to see which persons would take the lead rolls (as characters), in this ""revival""... and was pleasantly surprised (after the first thirty minutes), to see they work perfectly. It was only during the first thirty minutes of that first episode that I'd wondered why I'd bothered buying a remake of anything (which I hate to do, because they can never seem to capture the magic of the original characters). But that ""Willy Lumis"" characters ""shouting""... which the original ""Willy"" used to do all the time, and I'd hated, went away as Barnabus Collins quickly ""corrects"" him.... And there are many updated ""very hot"" ""Vampire"" scenes as well... Nothing like a good bit of Victoria Winters neck (played by very hot actress) to get the old blood boiling!

169477,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,1404996087,Monty Moonlight,"[2, 3]","In 1966, Dan Curtis introduced the world to an 18th century vampire named Barnabas Collins who shook up daytime television for nearly five years. The show, ""Dark Shadows"", is unquestionably a cult classic.In 1991, Barnabas Collins was revived in a completely new version of the show, going from daytime soap to nighttime soap, with a far superior budget and an outstanding cast. Some characters changed, some seemed very much the same. There were similar plot lines and seemingly new ones. There was a lot of romance, a lot of blood, and a lot of drama. It was a great show, and, in high school at the time, I was hooked on it! Horrifically, the popular revival only lasted one season, ending in a mind-numbing cliffhanger! The story is, there was too much playing with the time-slot due to NBC's coverage of the Gulf War. Oh well.This DVD set, thankfully, brings back the entire 1991 series, from the first episodes that were originally presented as a two-part TV movie, to that never resolved cliffhanger that made the show's cancellation more frustrating than ever. In this set, you'll witness Barnabas Collins' arrival in Collinsport, his taking of the gorgeous Daphne Collins, his pursuit of the Collins family's new governess, Victoria Winters, and his fateful first dealings with Doctor Julia Hoffman. You'll meet troubled David, sweet, haunting Sarah, a bumbling but lovable incarnation of Willie Loomis, super hot but very suspicious acting Carolyn Collins (perhaps she was just supposed to seem rebellious, but I always felt she acted like she had something up her sleeve), the psychic barmaid Maggie Evans, townie-hunk Joe Haskell, and, of course, the family matriarch, Elizabeth, and her brother Roger. Most fantastically though, you'll take a trip back to the 1700's to see how Barnabas Collins became a vampire at the hands of the drool-inducing temptress and part time witch, Angelique.No doubt, it's Ben Cross as Barnabas and Lysette Anthony as Angelique that rule the show here, but all the characters are fascinating and memorable. Hard to say that this version of the show was better than the original or not, as it was so short-lived, but it definitely is a classic in its own right. The DVD is a must-own, though I'll throw in my complaint about it being cropped to make a fake widescreen version. It's still better quality than watching my old tapes though. The only other thing to complain about is a complete lack of extra features, but maybe we're lucky to get short-lived shows like this on DVD at all.And, if you're a true Shadows fan, yeah, it stinks that the recent pilot with Marley Shelton (mmmm Marley Shelton, she's about as perfect as it gets) didn't get picked up, but I'm even more psyched that a bigscreen feature is in the works with Burton and Depp behind it (long as they don't screw up Barnabas like they did Wonka; I hope it will be more in the vein of Sleepy Hollow; More in the vein of Dark Shadows, actually). I had always hoped to be able to bring Dark Shadows to the bigscreen myself one day, but my plan was to do it as two trilogies, a Barnabas Collins trilogy (the first two films running a plot similar to this show, the third involving the resolution) and a Quentin Collins trilogy (Hugh Jackman, anyone? Quentin's trilogy would pick up from Barnabas's, include Barnabas as a heroic character now, and involve Quentin's werewolf condition). Anyways, we'll have to wait and see what Burton and Depp cook up, and it'll be cool if Depp stars as well, but in the meantime, we have this and the DVD sets of the original show (if you can afford to collect all of those! I haven't even dared to start...YET).",5,My early '90's obsession!,1216944000,"07 25, 2008",2008,3653,"['1966', 'Dan', 'Curtis', 'introduced', 'world', '18th', 'century', 'vampire', 'named', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'who', 'shook', 'up', 'daytime', 'television', 'nearly', 'five', 'years', 'show', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'unquestionably', 'cult', 'classic.In', '1991', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'was', 'revived', 'completely', 'new', 'version', 'show', 'going', 'daytime', 'soap', 'nighttime', 'soap', 'far', 'superior', 'budget', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'characters', 'changed', 'seemed', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'were', 'similar', 'plot', 'lines', 'seemingly', 'new', 'ones', 'was', 'lot', 'romance', 'lot', 'blood', 'lot', 'drama', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'high', 'school', 'time', 'was', 'hooked', 'Horrifically', 'popular', 'revival', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'ending', 'mind-numbing', 'cliffhanger', 'story', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'playing', 'time-slot', 'due', 'NBC', 'coverage', 'Gulf', 'War', 'Oh', 'well.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'thankfully', 'back', 'entire', '1991', 'series', 'first', 'episodes', 'were', 'originally', 'presented', 'two-part', 'TV', 'movie', 'never', 'resolved', 'cliffhanger', 'made', 'show', 'cancellation', 'more', 'frustrating', 'ever', 'set', ""'ll"", 'witness', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'arrival', 'Collinsport', 'taking', 'gorgeous', 'Daphne', 'Collins', 'pursuit', 'Collins', 'family', 'new', 'governess', 'Victoria', 'Winters', 'fateful', 'first', 'dealings', 'Doctor', 'Julia', 'Hoffman', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'troubled', 'David', 'sweet', 'haunting', 'Sarah', 'bumbling', 'lovable', 'incarnation', 'Willie', 'Loomis', 'super', 'hot', 'very', 'suspicious', 'acting', 'Carolyn', 'Collins', 'perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'supposed', 'seem', 'rebellious', 'always', 'felt', 'acted', 'had', 'something', 'up', 'sleeve', 'psychic', 'barmaid', 'Maggie', 'Evans', 'townie-hunk', 'Joe', 'Haskell', 'course', 'family', 'matriarch', 'Elizabeth', 'brother', 'Roger', 'Most', 'fantastically', ""'ll"", 'take', 'trip', 'back', '1700', 'see', 'how', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'became', 'vampire', 'hands', 'drool-inducing', 'temptress', 'part', 'time', 'witch', 'Angelique.No', 'doubt', 'Ben', 'Cross', 'Barnabas', 'Lysette', 'Anthony', 'Angelique', 'show', 'here', 'characters', 'are', 'fascinating', 'memorable', 'Hard', 'say', 'version', 'show', 'was', 'better', 'original', 'not', 'was', 'so', 'short-lived', 'definitely', 'classic', 'own', 'right', 'DVD', 'must-own', ""'ll"", 'throw', 'complaint', 'being', 'cropped', 'make', 'fake', 'widescreen', 'version', 'still', 'better', 'quality', 'watching', 'old', 'tapes', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'complain', 'about', 'complete', 'lack', 'extra', 'features', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'get', 'short-lived', 'shows', 'DVD', 'all.And', ""'re"", 'true', 'Shadows', 'fan', 'yeah', 'recent', 'pilot', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'mmmm', 'Marley', 'Shelton', 'about', 'as', 'perfect', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'picked', 'up', ""'m"", 'even', 'more', 'psyched', 'bigscreen', 'feature', 'works', 'Burton', 'Depp', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'screw', 'up', 'Barnabas', 'did', 'Wonka', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'vein', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'More', 'vein', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'actually', 'had', 'always', 'hoped', 'be', 'able', 'bring', 'Dark', 'Shadows', 'bigscreen', 'one', 'day', 'plan', 'was', 'do', 'two', 'trilogies', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', 'trilogy', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'running', 'plot', 'similar', 'show', 'third', 'involving', 'resolution', 'Quentin', 'Collins', 'trilogy', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'anyone', 'Quentin', 'trilogy', 'would', 'pick', 'up', 'Barnabas', 'include', 'Barnabas', 'heroic', 'character', 'now', 'involve', 'Quentin', 'werewolf', 'condition', 'Anyways', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'Burton', 'Depp', 'cook', 'up', ""'ll"", 'be', 'cool', 'Depp', 'as', 'well', 'meantime', 'have', 'DVD', 'sets', 'original', 'show', 'can', 'afford', 'collect', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'dared', 'start', 'YET']",N/A

(Okay, okay... to be honest, I got them for Christmas. But you get the point!) So when the DVD collection came out, I of course dashed to the store, plucked down my cash and was grateful to clear some space in my ever-burgeoning collection.I then immediately plopped down in front of the TV and rewatched the scene that, for me, was the highlight of the primetime retelling: The moment when Victoria Winters first lays eyes on Josette Dupres as a menacing Angelique stands just behind her. The music swells, Josette turns and Victoria, along with the audience, gasps. ""She looks just like me!"" Freeze frame and CUT!I adored the primetime version of the cult classic if for no other reason than that it remained fairly faithful to the soap many of us ran home to watch after school each day. All of my favorites were there... or at least most of them. And yes, I would have loved to see the show expand beyond the story of Barnabas, exploring early storylines that were dropped, such as Maggie's psychic abilities. I'm sure those avenues would have been explored had the show (sob) lasted longer than it did.That said, I walked away from the DVD wondering... where are the extras? Surely they could have gotten some cast commentary or, at the very least, bloopers? In an ideal world, wouldn't we all have liked to see the latest version of the soap, which was picked up as a pilot for the WB a season or two back, but never made it to air? Somewhere out there a pilot exists, and I for one would love nothing more than to see it.Alright, enough complaining. For Dark Shadows fans, this is a no-brainer: I don't have to tell you to buy it, because you already did! But for those who maybe caught the original series during its run on the Sci Fi channel (which also aired this version a year or so after it was cancelled), or who have heard about this oddity in the soap world for years but never actually seen it, this is the perfect introduction. But be warned... once bitten by Barnabas and pals, you will find yourself craving more.

169506,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,1404996087,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[1, 4]","In 1991 NBC brought back the popular 1960's daytime soap opera ""Dark Shadows"" as a primetime series. However, there were two things already against the show: the first being the timing. By 1991 audiences were tired of continuing dramas during the evening hours as shows like ""Dynasty"" and ""Falcon Crest"" had biten the dust and ""Dallas"" was on its way out. The second problem was the Gulf War. That particular moment in U.S. history was covered continuosly by all 3 major U.S. networks and ""Dark Shadows"" was constantly pre-empted or rescheduled. This caused the huge audience that tuned in for the pilot (an estimated 1 in 4 Americans) to stop watching as they couldn't find it on their screens. Anyone knows a soap needs the same time period to build a loyal following, but NBC didn't heed this warning. After only 12 episodes were aired the ax fell on what could have been a hit series if it hadn't been for the timing and the war.Thankfully, back in 2009 all 12 episodes of this classic remake were made available for purchase. Dan Curtis (the creator of the original) brought the serial back with an amazing cast headed by sexy hunk Ben Cross as Barnabas and Jean Simmons as Elizabeth Collins Stoddard. Most of the 1960's stories were replayed accompanied by amazing special effects and beautiful cinematography.If your a fan of the franchise this is a great companion piece to own.
