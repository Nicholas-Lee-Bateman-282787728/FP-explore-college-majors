1393452,A3V03HSQS3SFLU,B004AJMO4C,S. Marzioli,"[5, 5]","I read a review online prior to watching this that said it was (cult dark-comedy classic) The Room bad. I was skeptical, but I liked the idea of The Room meets the Exorcist, and eventually gave in and bought it. Yesterday night I finally watched it. I was expecting it to be horrible and it definitely was! When the main character meets up with the half green pig and the pig starts to speak to her in a Heavy Metal bass voice, I laughed long and hard. And when they flashed to scenes of the girl getting possessed, prancing around and spinning at double-film speed, I laughed some more. And when the film cut, and the scene changed to an image of the girl's feet, which suddenly lifted off the ground to imply she was levitating,  I laughed and laughed and, maybe, even slapped my leg.But the laughter ended eventually and it settled into a storyline that could have been cut into a thirty minute episode. If I had to describe it with a single word, it would be plodding. They tried to spice it up with some humor (a man eating a sandwich over an autopsy table: quips the priest, ""I can see how a man could work up an appetite in this line of work""), some mystery (a strange woman and a girl are walking on the beach, as the priest looks on) and some demonic clips (prancing at double-speed, with cheesy make-up).The only thing that kept me going were the occasional unexpected amusing bits. The fact that the family of the possessed girl was named (what sounded like) McMurder was pretty amusing. The fact that the aging, hairy, barrel chested priest could see the future and the past, as well as kick demon butt was amusing too. The fact that this was secretly a Christian film was interesting and, given the results and random inclusion of Christian messages, amusing too. Frankly, I'm surprised anyone with an obvious Christian agenda would make a violent horror film, but I'd welcome more of this sort of religious film than any of the candy-coated Hallmark wannabes that one usually associates with Christian films.Maybe I'm being too kind, but I did think the last scene was mildly creepy. They finally tossed aside the Heavy Metal bass vocals for a simple slightly distorted male voice for the possessed girl, and it worked a lot better for it. And though the make-up was kind of sloppy, it was still pretty effective, thanks to a suddenly explosive performance from the possessed lead. But it was a quick scene and it ended too soon, and gave away to... Oh, I dunno, I kind of started skipping ahead every 5 minutes starting at the twenty minute mark, and I'm pretty sure I started skipping ahead during this scene as well once they resumed their normal low standards. Last of all, before the credits, a dedication was made of this whole bloody, violent, demonic affair to the creator's recently departed relative. And that, my friends, was perhaps the scariest part of all.I can't tell you to not watch this. I can't even say this is the worst film I've ever seen--it's not! I can say, if any of this sounds like your thing, and you have a healthy dose of riffing skills and a room full of friends, you might just enjoy it on some sick-twisted level that you should be ashamed of.",2,Not bad enough to be a laugh riot,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,3191,"['read', 'review', 'online', 'prior', 'watching', 'said', 'was', 'cult', 'dark-comedy', 'classic', 'Room', 'bad', 'was', 'skeptical', 'liked', 'idea', 'Room', 'Exorcist', 'eventually', 'gave', 'bought', 'Yesterday', 'night', 'finally', 'watched', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'horrible', 'definitely', 'was', 'When', 'main', 'character', 'up', 'half', 'green', 'pig', 'pig', 'speak', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'bass', 'voice', 'laughed', 'long', 'hard', 'when', 'flashed', 'scenes', 'girl', 'getting', 'possessed', 'prancing', 'around', 'spinning', 'double-film', 'speed', 'laughed', 'more', 'when', 'film', 'cut', 'scene', 'changed', 'image', 'girl', 'feet', 'suddenly', 'lifted', 'off', 'ground', 'imply', 'was', 'levitating', 'laughed', 'laughed', 'maybe', 'even', 'slapped', 'leg.But', 'laughter', 'ended', 'eventually', 'settled', 'storyline', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'thirty', 'minute', 'episode', 'had', 'describe', 'single', 'word', 'would', 'be', 'plodding', 'tried', 'spice', 'up', 'humor', 'man', 'eating', 'sandwich', 'autopsy', 'table', 'priest', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'man', 'could', 'work', 'up', 'appetite', 'line', 'work', 'mystery', 'strange', 'woman', 'girl', 'are', 'walking', 'beach', 'priest', 'demonic', 'clips', 'prancing', 'double-speed', 'cheesy', 'make-up', 'only', 'thing', 'kept', 'going', 'were', 'occasional', 'unexpected', 'amusing', 'bits', 'fact', 'family', 'possessed', 'girl', 'was', 'named', 'what', 'sounded', 'McMurder', 'was', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'fact', 'aging', 'hairy', 'barrel', 'chested', 'priest', 'could', 'see', 'future', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'kick', 'demon', 'butt', 'was', 'amusing', 'too', 'fact', 'was', 'secretly', 'Christian', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'given', 'results', 'random', 'inclusion', 'Christian', 'messages', 'amusing', 'too', 'Frankly', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'anyone', 'obvious', 'Christian', 'agenda', 'would', 'make', 'violent', 'horror', 'film', ""'d"", 'welcome', 'more', 'sort', 'religious', 'film', 'candy-coated', 'Hallmark', 'wannabes', 'one', 'usually', 'Christian', 'films.Maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'kind', 'did', 'think', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'mildly', 'creepy', 'finally', 'tossed', 'aside', 'Heavy', 'Metal', 'bass', 'vocals', 'simple', 'slightly', 'distorted', 'male', 'voice', 'possessed', 'girl', 'worked', 'lot', 'better', 'make-up', 'was', 'kind', 'sloppy', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'effective', 'thanks', 'suddenly', 'explosive', 'performance', 'possessed', 'lead', 'was', 'quick', 'scene', 'ended', 'too', 'soon', 'gave', 'away', 'Oh', 'dunno', 'kind', 'started', 'skipping', 'ahead', '5', 'minutes', 'starting', 'twenty', 'minute', 'mark', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'started', 'skipping', 'ahead', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'resumed', 'normal', 'low', 'standards', 'Last', 'credits', 'dedication', 'was', 'made', 'whole', 'bloody', 'violent', 'demonic', 'affair', 'creator', 'recently', 'departed', 'relative', 'friends', 'was', 'perhaps', 'scariest', 'part', 'all.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'not', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'worst', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'not', 'can', 'say', 'thing', 'have', 'healthy', 'dose', 'riffing', 'skills', 'room', 'full', 'friends', 'might', 'just', 'enjoy', 'sick-twisted', 'level', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed']",Legion: The Final Exorcism
