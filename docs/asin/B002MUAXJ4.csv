1278438,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B002MUAXJ4,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[7, 7]","Midsomer Murders Set 16 was so worth the wait!!  I think it was the best season yet.  All four entries were superb.  It was difficult to decide which I liked best.  I would say it would be easier to say which I liked least which would have to be the first story, Midsomer Life.  It was a good introduction to the four; however, since each one gets just a little crazier.The Christmas episode was delightful and my favorite; for those of us faced with late life employment and youthful supervisors with little or no experience but with all sorts of ""fresh ideas"" that reinvent the wheel and bury one in paper work, it created great resonance.  Its resolution was delightful.  All I could say was ""Yes!!!""  At least the poor naive fool was well intended; an earlier one was rather nasty and I kept hoping someone would bump him off--they tried but Barnaby saved him!""The Magician's Nephew"" was well plotted and though the outcome was not entirely unsuspected, was quite clever.  I certainly didn't have it until about mid-film.  The mysterious ambiances and the odd relationships really made the thing.  Certainly the visiting cast were wonderful.  Here the importance of venue and the cooperation of ""audience"" in ""mysticism"" was oh so obvious in this one--as indeed the next--especially at the end.The last entry--and my second favorite--is ""Talking to the Dead.""  While it ranks my ""second,"" I have to admit it was the most complex and content rich.  It alone would be worth the price of the set.  Here again the mis en sc&egrave;ne of spiritualism, with its carefully engineered emotional components and the mental cooperation of the audience, was made very clear as it was in the ""Magician's Nephew.""  Once its credulousness was exposed to it, the audience disappeared.  One cannot help but believe, however, that each person will merely have labeled this particular practitioner of the ""spiritual arts"" as a charlatan rather than all such people as such. We all like to believe in magic.  The confrontation of Christian and Pagan power sources was particularly amusing, since each claimed the other a fraud and each challenged the other for power over the ""flock.""  In the end their interactions made it obvious that each needed the other to justify his own existence!  The iron maiden scene where Sergeant Jones gets trapped inside was wonderful, especially after watching the mechanism work.  I appreciated the bright mind that came up with this literary device.  While amusing the viewer, it also alerted him to the sound and its significance when it occurred nearer the end of the episode, and with great effect too.  It was at once grisly and yet fascinating and reminded me of one of the Hamish Macbeth series--one of Season Three as I recall,Hamish MacBeth: Series 1-3 Collection--when something equally grisly occurred to another character who, along with the audience, also understood what was about to happen to him. I kept expecting the Hamish Macbeth victim to escape in the nick of time which made it an even more startling finale.  Here as soon as one heard the sound one knew there was no hope.I enjoyed the interactions of Inspector Barnaby with his family.  For a while I felt that both Joyce and Cully were getting a little tired of their roles, but that is definitely not the case here.  Both are as energetic and delightful as they were early in the series.  One again feels that they have lives outside of the mystery, and that they are a real resource to Barnaby; his personal source of strength and renewal after his ventures into the world of madness called Midsomer! Though they only pop up once in a while through each episode, they're appearance is always welcome and highly anticipated.  Though I know their function in the mechanics of these works is to lend a background of sanity against which the craziness of Midsomer can be contrasted, I still love them.  This series even more than past episodes really made it clear how much Barnaby does too.  The warmth and love and the funny little family events bring charm to the stories--and cast in very high relief the wackiness of the rest of Midsomer!Totally memorable series, wonderful entries, can't wait for more.",5,Superlative!!!,1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,4199,"['Midsomer', 'Murders', 'Set', '16', 'was', 'so', 'worth', 'wait', 'think', 'was', 'best', 'season', 'yet', 'four', 'entries', 'were', 'superb', 'was', 'difficult', 'decide', 'liked', 'best', 'would', 'say', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'say', 'liked', 'least', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'first', 'story', 'Midsomer', 'Life', 'was', 'good', 'introduction', 'four', 'however', 'one', 'just', 'little', 'crazier.The', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'was', 'delightful', 'favorite', 'faced', 'late', 'life', 'employment', 'youthful', 'supervisors', 'little', 'experience', 'sorts', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'reinvent', 'wheel', 'bury', 'one', 'paper', 'work', 'created', 'great', 'resonance', 'resolution', 'was', 'delightful', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'Yes', 'least', 'poor', 'naive', 'fool', 'was', 'well', 'intended', 'earlier', 'one', 'was', 'rather', 'nasty', 'kept', 'hoping', 'someone', 'would', 'bump', 'off', 'tried', 'Barnaby', 'saved', 'Magician', 'Nephew', 'was', 'well', 'plotted', 'outcome', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'unsuspected', 'was', 'quite', 'clever', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'mid-film', 'mysterious', 'ambiances', 'odd', 'relationships', 'really', 'made', 'thing', 'Certainly', 'visiting', 'cast', 'were', 'wonderful', 'Here', 'importance', 'venue', 'cooperation', 'audience', 'mysticism', 'was', 'oh', 'so', 'obvious', 'one', 'indeed', 'next', 'especially', 'end.The', 'last', 'entry', 'second', 'favorite', 'Talking', 'Dead', 'second', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'most', 'complex', 'content', 'rich', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'price', 'set', 'Here', 'again', 'mis', 'sc', 'egrave', 'ne', 'spiritualism', 'carefully', 'engineered', 'emotional', 'components', 'mental', 'cooperation', 'audience', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'clear', 'was', 'Magician', 'Nephew', 'credulousness', 'was', 'exposed', 'audience', 'disappeared', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'believe', 'however', 'person', 'will', 'merely', 'have', 'labeled', 'particular', 'practitioner', 'spiritual', 'arts', 'charlatan', 'rather', 'such', 'people', 'such', 'believe', 'magic', 'confrontation', 'Christian', 'Pagan', 'power', 'sources', 'was', 'particularly', 'amusing', 'claimed', 'other', 'fraud', 'challenged', 'other', 'power', 'flock', 'end', 'interactions', 'made', 'obvious', 'needed', 'other', 'justify', 'own', 'existence', 'iron', 'maiden', 'scene', 'where', 'Sergeant', 'Jones', 'trapped', 'inside', 'was', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'watching', 'mechanism', 'work', 'appreciated', 'bright', 'mind', 'came', 'up', 'literary', 'device', 'amusing', 'viewer', 'also', 'alerted', 'sound', 'significance', 'when', 'occurred', 'end', 'episode', 'great', 'effect', 'too', 'was', 'once', 'grisly', 'yet', 'fascinating', 'reminded', 'one', 'Hamish', 'Macbeth', 'series', 'one', 'Season', 'Three', 'recall', 'Hamish', 'MacBeth', 'Series', '1-3', 'Collection', 'when', 'something', 'equally', 'grisly', 'occurred', 'character', 'who', 'audience', 'also', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'happen', 'kept', 'expecting', 'Hamish', 'Macbeth', 'victim', 'escape', 'nick', 'time', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'startling', 'finale', 'Here', 'as', 'soon', 'one', 'heard', 'sound', 'one', 'knew', 'was', 'hope.I', 'enjoyed', 'interactions', 'Inspector', 'Barnaby', 'family', 'while', 'felt', 'Joyce', 'Cully', 'were', 'getting', 'little', 'tired', 'roles', 'definitely', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'are', 'energetic', 'delightful', 'were', 'early', 'series', 'One', 'again', 'feels', 'have', 'lives', 'mystery', 'are', 'real', 'resource', 'Barnaby', 'personal', 'source', 'strength', 'renewal', 'ventures', 'world', 'madness', 'called', 'Midsomer', 'only', 'pop', 'up', 'once', 'while', 'episode', ""'re"", 'appearance', 'always', 'welcome', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'know', 'function', 'mechanics', 'works', 'lend', 'background', 'sanity', 'craziness', 'Midsomer', 'can', 'be', 'contrasted', 'still', 'love', 'series', 'even', 'more', 'past', 'episodes', 'really', 'made', 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'Barnaby', 'too', 'warmth', 'love', 'funny', 'little', 'family', 'events', 'bring', 'charm', 'stories', 'cast', 'very', 'high', 'relief', 'wackiness', 'rest', 'Midsomer', 'Totally', 'memorable', 'series', 'wonderful', 'entries', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'more']",N/A

Set 16 is disappointing, although it is, once more, mildly pleasant to follow Barnaby and Jones in their exploits. The scripts in this installment are needlessly convoluted, often outright bizarre and utterly unbelievable. ""Midsomer Life"" is poorly written, the other three have elements of the supernatural which fail to convince not only Barnaby, but also the intelligent viewer. Gothic settings abound, and when you see Barnaby and Jones, at night and alone, stumbling around in the woods like the Keystone Cops, you realize that the humor is not all intentional. This is plain old stupid. So are the Halloween and Christmas backdrops, not to mention witchcraft and the pagan cult.

Nothing to match it on USA TV. This series is perfection in its genre. A less-than 2-year wait from original airing to DVD is fine when it is this caliber of material. Look how long US TV greats like ""Roots"", ""Dr. Quinn"" and others took to get into homes. For obtaining DVD rights for an across the ocean series, and adding SUBTITLES, one might give Acorn Media a pat on the back for boldly-quick.Regardless, this series is worth the purchase. This set from Amazon is about half-price of other movies when considering individual episodes comparable to other feature-length mystery films. Packaged groups of the series ""Midsomer Murders-The Early Cases Collection"" and ""Midsomer Murders-Barnaby's Casebook"" cost only about $6 per episode. That's a value to me, coming out as fast as reported possible, and being the excellent mystery series that can't be figured out till the very end of each episode. The collections are an inexpensive way to get caught initiated into Midsomer crime if you are new to this world-acclaimed series.DCI Barnaby (John Nettles) has taken on the fictional Midsomer County murder abundance, often multiple like war or massacre, since 1997. Killing chaos is the norm in Midsomer County but the visual sensuality of the setting offsets the blood and murder combos. Fantastic English village/country better than many travel DVDs.Some comedy exists in every episode through expressions, statements, and unusual additions to crime scenes. It's a trademark of the show, as much as the murders piling up on one another.No foul language issues, but plenty of good family murder mystery--the murder is almost never seen, just the moments up to the kill, and then of course the body. How many ways can a person be murdered? Midsomer keeps finding new ones. Part of the humor, actually, is the excessive number of murders in a lovely rural/village setting that could count dastardly deaths per sq. ft.You'll want to set yourself down in a town green, at a location like Badger's Wood, and sip tea in quality china, just waiting on a few body parts to drop from the sky. This series was based on books by novelist Caroline Graham, but have gone beyond those books. You'll fall in love with the regular characters.The series is supposed to end on British TV soon, but HOW will it ever end? Barnaby discovering his own murder, and will he be killed twice, or more? Then who will find justice for him? Barnaby always gets HIS man. Will there be any comedy in the final episode.

His last appearance will be in ep.82. His replacement has finally been revealed! The episode airing tonight on British TV (ep.75 The Sword of Guillaume) will see a new character introduced: John Barnaby, Tom Barnaby's nephew, will arrive in Midsomer, to help with a case while Tom is away. He will eventually take over as DCI, when Tom retires. The character is played by Neil Dudgeon (49), a hard working British TV actor, with a few screen films behind his belt; you may have seen him as Joshua in the 2008 comedy The Son of Rambow. So, there you have it! Only time will tell how the replacement works out. Most comments, regarding the actor's potential to succeed in Midsomer, have so far been positive. Taking into consideration the speed of Acorn releases in the US, we will have to wait till 2013 before we can judge for ourselves...PS: For those new to this British masterpiece, Midsomer Murders is a long running ""who done it"", based on the novels of Caroline Graham, starring John Nettles (of the Bergerac fame) as the unflappable Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby. The series is set in the fictional Misomer County, which comprises of many cozy, rural villages, where wealthy and poor alike seem to do each other in at an average rate of three to four bodies per episode.
