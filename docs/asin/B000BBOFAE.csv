First problem i have with this crapis that the titles seem to last longer then the movie its self.Next is the acting omg very very bad the guy that played the killer looked and sounded like he was an inmate at the local nut house and the directors got a good price on him as long as they rember to give him his meds lol very dull and bland and no wonder reggie hasnt been in a film since phantasm his apperence lasted mabye ten mins and he look and sounded like he was reading from a que card the fx were very very bad with the violance coming in very short fast bursts. And The other biggest problem when did the orignal machine the speed ironer have knifes and axes and shxt? I cant belive two guys directed this filth they should of called this something other then the mangeler which the first movie was good but hollywood has to ruin everything you dont care about any one in this movie i think only one person has a name it seems like it was shot in a day and one more thing how the hell hard is it to kick a door open stay clear of this as soon as i saw it i retured it and they gave me a credit thankfuly these idots wont ever be behind a cam agaim,1,Whats with Lions Gate?,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,1508,"['First', 'off', 'i', 'dont', 'understand', 'why', 'hella', 'fast', 'rising', 'movie', 'studio', 'made', 'suchhits', 'Cabin', 'fever', 'Saw', 'Saw2', 'American', 'Psycho', 'andHigh', 'Tension', 'Devils', 'Rejects', 'would', 'release', 'shxt', 'worse', 'then', 'part', '2', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'orignal', 'i', 'heard', 'talk', 'one', 'going', 'back', 'roots', 'orignal', 'haha', 'laugh', 'First', 'problem', 'i', 'have', 'crapis', 'titles', 'seem', 'last', 'longer', 'then', 'movie', 'self.Next', 'acting', 'omg', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'guy', 'played', 'killer', 'looked', 'sounded', 'was', 'inmate', 'local', 'nut', 'house', 'directors', 'got', 'good', 'price', 'as', 'long', 'rember', 'give', 'meds', 'lol', 'very', 'dull', 'bland', 'wonder', 'reggie', 'hasnt', 'been', 'film', 'phantasm', 'apperence', 'lasted', 'mabye', 'ten', 'mins', 'look', 'sounded', 'was', 'reading', 'que', 'card', 'fx', 'were', 'very', 'very', 'bad', 'violance', 'coming', 'very', 'short', 'fast', 'bursts', 'other', 'biggest', 'problem', 'when', 'did', 'orignal', 'machine', 'speed', 'ironer', 'have', 'knifes', 'axes', 'shxt', 'cant', 'belive', 'two', 'guys', 'directed', 'filth', 'should', 'called', 'something', 'other', 'then', 'mangeler', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'hollywood', 'ruin', 'everything', 'dont', 'care', 'one', 'movie', 'i', 'think', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'name', 'was', 'shot', 'day', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'how', 'hell', 'hard', 'kick', 'door', 'open', 'stay', 'clear', 'as', 'soon', 'i', 'saw', 'retured', 'gave', 'credit', 'thankfuly', 'idots', 'wont', 'ever', 'be', 'cam', 'agaim']",N/A

Most people probably couldn't care less about the series or hadn't even heard of it but after reading a bit too many unfair reviews I thought I'd give my opinion on it.The Mangler series is pretty cheesy honestly. It's based on a mediocre Stephen King short story about a killer laundry machine. The first film was based on the short but the sequels are only connected by title.The second film I saw in 2003 or so. It was a bad film. No question about it.I just saw the 3rd cause I had some time to waste and I never watched it cause of the terrible 2nd and it was a decent surprise. Sure it was a bit low budget but what surprised me that it was actually mildly suspenseful with a creepy killer. It also avoided falling into it's cheesy premise.Horror classic? No. But it is much better then people made it out to be and it's worth a watch. Hey it's only about 80 minutes too! So it's not overlong or anything.Give it a try if you're a horror fan.

939567,AD9MPLYLMHKCC,B000BBOFAE,Ghoulie Guru,"[2, 2]","WARNING: possible spoilers ahead...Reggie Bannister from the Phantasm movies makes his move away from Don Coscarelli in this pitiful would-be sequel to the Mangler. The original, which was based partially on a Stephen King short story, was about a laundry machine that ate people. Robert Englund played the psychotic owner of the laundry who fed people to the machine. It was basically Little Shop of Horrors with a laundry machine instead of a plant.This one jettisoned the supernatural laundry machine and went for a more straightforward serial killer tale. The story is about a repairman who buys the old Mangler on eBay and starts restoring it in his basement. Once the machine nears completion, it possesses him and turns him into its minion. The rest of the movie is about this repairman going around and getting meat for his machine. There's a lot of screaming done by women as he hits them repeatedly with a hammer. I have to wonder about the two guys that wrote and directed this movie, and where this misogynistic streak is coming from.It seems like the writers/directors were going for that unrelenting Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Haute Tension, Saw, Hostel kind of vibe that seems to be all the rage these days.

That Mangler should never have been reborn. The original was at least the morbid fantasizing of what Stephen King suffered in the summer when he was a high school teacher: he worked in a laundry factory and he worked with such pressing machines that could turn criminal, with no security and the bosses who did not want to spend one cent on security, as if blue collar workers were supposed to be kept secure. After all, accidents were the privilege of all these salary-hungry people. But in this film we are left with a Joe the plumber turned vampire and the Mangler is his revived invention, machine or whatever that provides him with his pint of blood everyday.

It is a rare example of a low budget horror film that is played totally straight, no humor and very little self-parody.With a budget of just $85,000 they had to be very inventive so don't expect elaborate production design or special effects. The title character looks like a cafeteria dishwasher being operated by ""Edward Scissorhands"". They try to pass the thing off as sinister by always showing it in shadows. When a victim is fed to the thing they change to very tight shots of knives and clippers, trying to make it seem like they are part of the machine rather than being held by crew members off-camera. Obviously the film would benefit from a more elaborate and diabolical device, or at least one with some credibility.But the Stephen King inspired premise is a good one and the first two thirds of the film set it all up very nicely. It is almost captivating for a while but finally runs out of gas and plods through the final 30 minutes.An appliance repairman (Weston Blakesley) has acquired the cursed parts from the original ""Mangler"" (named for the old-style washing machine with external rollers to squeeze the water out of clothes) and is obsessively working to reinvent the lethal thing. Eventually he becomes possessed by the machine and more zombie than human. He must feed it humans because he needs to drink their ""squeezins"" to keep his zombie body from decaying.Blakesley is quite credible as the slack jawed zombie who takes a rubber mallet on his repair calls and acquires his victims from among his customers. His life is complicated when a father and son burglar team (Reggie Bannister and Scott Speiser) attempt to rob his house and when his daughter comes for a visit.Aimee Brooks gets a whole bunch of standard scream queen moments and is extremely attractive.The main problem is that not enough happens to sustain an eighty-minute feature.

The gore and blood scenes make me give this movie 2 stars. Other than that, the movie is neither suspenseful or thrilling. The mangler machine is rebuilt by a repairman who decides to keep the machine alive by feeding humans to it. A couple of cool scenes but that's it. This was another let down movie.
