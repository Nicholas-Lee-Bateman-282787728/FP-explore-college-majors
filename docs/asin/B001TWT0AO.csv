In Vol.2 Sammy Davis Jr. and a very young Richard Dreyfuss make their first guest appearances. Chief Metcalf asks the squad to find his daughter who has disappeared, and Linc fights for his life while we see flashbacks of the squad's first two years on the force.

1237579,AYV0BT5KNQFXX,B001TWT0AO,Debbie Wilson,"[0, 0]","The Mod Squad was a challenging show that I enjoyed as a youngster. The vulnerable Julie, the exiled Pete, and the thoughtful Linc were so cool. We bought this set to see if we would enjoy it even now and still do. Clarence Williams III's (Linc's) perceptive, thoughtful, and athletic portrayal are especially enjoyable. We have found it a vehicle for discussion of drug use, Hollywood's portrayals of certain points of views, of history (ancient since there were no cell phones) with our twelve-year-old daughter. Most of the episodes are high quality, feature good photography, and demonstrate a well-written story.  The acting, especially Clarence Williams III's, are excellent. My husband considers Linc's character as the foundational character of the series.

1237580,ASBGPDCWRP11A,B001TWT0AO,"DLHSmith ""DLHS""","[4, 4]","I recently took a 'staycation' at home and watched the first 52 episodes of The Mod Squad. It was one of my favorite shows when it originally aired in the 60s/70s. I was a teenager - always on the lookout for a cute guy. But The Mod Squad is more than just a cute guy, a hip chick and a smart, succinct & 'solid' black guy. It was a show that reflected it's time more than anything else.I would recommend all four volumes to anyone who loved this show, or anyone who wants to understand what the 60s were like. The cast was perfect and outstanding for their roles. Season 1, Volume 1 has extra features that include interviews with Michael Cole and Peggy Lipton, who tell a lot of fun stories about their time on the show. Yes, Clarence Williams III is absent from the special features, but it may have been his choice, who knows? At the time the beginning volumes were released in 2007, he was involved in 'Mystery Woman' with Kellie Martin on Hallmark Channel.My favorite episode of all the 52 is ""A Time for Remembering."" Not your typical flashback show - the sensitve portrayals by the cast members as they deal with a vengeful ex-convict's shooting of one of their own is a true treat. The ex-con is the first guy they put away. You can see him in Season One, Volume One, the pilot episode entitled ""The Teeth of the Barracuda.""There are great guest stars, some already famous, and some who became famous later. I enjoyed figuring out some of them. Some of them I hadn't seen in a show for a long time. There's even a special feature on the first season called ""The Friends of The Mod Squad,"" featuring Ed Asner, Lesley Warren, Lou Gossett, Jr. & Tyne Daly.I hope the other seasons will be released. I'm waiting especially for Episode #91 - I Am My Brother's Keeper, a Season Four episode. I haven't seen it in many years. But there's a whole season to be released before that (26 episodes).Yes, I was bummed at each season being split into 13 episodes per set - but as many times as I plan to watch these shows, I'm sure I'll get my money's worth. I bought them when they were a bit reduced. I'll be watching for specials.I highly recommend these videos for anyone interested at all in The Mod Squad.

As for this particular title it was originally on when I was in high school so I didn't get to see  it much but when I did I liked it now I have time to watch it. I have noticed that there is a great number of the older TV shows available on DVD and Blue Ray and I have started to build a good collection and Amazon.com is one of the best places to buy them they offer a great many titles at a very good price.
