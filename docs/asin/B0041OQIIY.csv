This video Older and Much Wiser Workout is a step up from the first video. It is still low impact exercizes, but has more cardio.  Now she alternates between the two videos.  I recommend this workout for older adults",5,Good workout,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,321,"['wife', 'had', 'been', 'using', 'video', 'Older', 'Wiser', 'Workout', 'loved', 'was', 'very', 'low', 'impact', 'video', 'Older', 'Much', 'Wiser', 'Workout', 'step', 'up', 'first', 'video', 'still', 'low', 'impact', 'more', 'cardio', 'Now', 'two', 'videos', 'recommend', 'workout', 'older', 'adults']",N/A

Norwood,"[3, 3]","I am 55 years old & I have a history of lumbar sprain & rotator cuff injuries, & quite frankly I question the safety of the entire workout video.  I greatly injoyed the Older & Wiser video that I recently purchased which had detailed instructions on how to do the aerobic section. Whereas in this video, she hurredly gives instructions & then she turns at an angle so I cannot see the exact angle of her arms & proper foot placement.  In one cardio segment, there is a lot of twisting.  They do imitations of golf swings in a sport that she has never played.  There is the twist, the Charleston, & the hoola hoop. In fact, she states that she has never attempted any of the sports in which she is demonstrating movements. I have had a back injury while twisting in the past & I just do not think that I can do this segment.  True, there are 3 different levels demonstrated for the viewer to follow, but I am still afraid to follow the easiest level.  There is a lot of overhead reaching & balance required which I am not up to unless I balance with a chair.  The DVD does say that this is gentle exercise for beginners who have been inactive, but I do not believe it.  I will not be buying anymore of her DVDs.  I much prefer Angie Miller's Absolute Beginners Cardio & Strength Training Workout for Seniors which is done at this level & is safe for me.",2,Older & Much Wiser Workout for Active Older Adults,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,1352,"['am', '55', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'history', 'lumbar', 'sprain', 'rotator', 'cuff', 'injuries', 'quite', 'frankly', 'question', 'safety', 'entire', 'workout', 'video', 'greatly', 'injoyed', 'Older', 'Wiser', 'video', 'recently', 'purchased', 'had', 'detailed', 'instructions', 'how', 'do', 'aerobic', 'section', 'Whereas', 'video', 'hurredly', 'instructions', 'then', 'angle', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'exact', 'angle', 'arms', 'proper', 'foot', 'placement', 'one', 'cardio', 'segment', 'lot', 'twisting', 'do', 'imitations', 'golf', 'swings', 'sport', 'never', 'played', 'twist', 'Charleston', 'hoola', 'hoop', 'fact', 'never', 'attempted', 'sports', 'demonstrating', 'movements', 'have', 'had', 'back', 'injury', 'twisting', 'past', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'segment', 'True', 'are', '3', 'different', 'levels', 'demonstrated', 'viewer', 'follow', 'am', 'still', 'afraid', 'follow', 'easiest', 'level', 'lot', 'overhead', 'reaching', 'balance', 'required', 'am', 'not', 'balance', 'chair', 'DVD', 'say', 'gentle', 'exercise', 'beginners', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'inactive', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'buying', 'anymore', 'DVDs', 'much', 'prefer', 'Angie', 'Miller', 'Absolute', 'Beginners', 'Cardio', 'Strength', 'Training', 'Workout', 'Seniors', 'done', 'level', 'safe']",N/A
1382057,A3DLHZLLOAO6K1,B0041OQIIY,hs,"[1, 1]","I bought this DVD because I wanted to add some more variety to my collection.  I like it, because they offer quite a few options:  strength, aerobic, balance, etc., so you can customize your workout each time.  The exercises work quite a few muscles and there are always different options in terms of levels of difficulty.  You get great bang for your buck here.The leader (Sue?)'s voice is grating, as is some of her commentary.  After you do the DVD a few times, you wont' even hear it, but the first time it was a surprise.

1382058,A1ZYYW01CTPFTF,B0041OQIIY,Mountain Melody,"[4, 9]","Two great things happened for me this past year.First, I discovered the books Seasoned Romance, Dr. Ruth's Sex at 50, and Grandpa Does Grandma, each of which helped me realize (to a larger extent than ever before) that seniors could still be excited about sex and romance. One of the main common threads running through each of SR's extraordinary chapter/story, I noticed especially, was the importance of exercise and fitness as a prerequisite to great lovemaking. Needless to say, that got my attention.Which leads me to number two: I discovered several great exercise DVDs and books specifically for seniors, including the Older & Wiser Workout and the Older & Much Wiser Workout, both by Sue Grant. These two I mentioned are both for seniors, but they take you from beginning to more advanced.More than ever, I've become such a cheerleader for seniors to (1) get back in the romance game and (2) focus on fitness.Thanks, Sue Grant, for the great work you are doing for seniors like me!",5,"Older, Wiser and Much Healther",1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,989,"['Two', 'great', 'things', 'happened', 'past', 'year.First', 'discovered', 'books', 'Seasoned', 'Romance', 'Dr.', 'Ruth', 'Sex', '50', 'Grandpa', 'Does', 'Grandma', 'helped', 'realize', 'larger', 'extent', 'ever', 'seniors', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'excited', 'sex', 'romance', 'One', 'main', 'common', 'threads', 'running', 'SR', 'extraordinary', 'chapter/story', 'noticed', 'especially', 'was', 'importance', 'exercise', 'fitness', 'prerequisite', 'great', 'lovemaking', 'Needless', 'say', 'got', 'attention.Which', 'number', 'two', 'discovered', 'several', 'great', 'exercise', 'DVDs', 'books', 'specifically', 'seniors', 'including', 'Older', 'Wiser', 'Workout', 'Older', 'Much', 'Wiser', 'Workout', 'Sue', 'Grant', 'two', 'mentioned', 'are', 'seniors', 'take', 'beginning', 'more', 'advanced.More', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'become', 'cheerleader', 'seniors', '1', 'get', 'back', 'romance', 'game', '2', 'focus', 'fitness.Thanks', 'Sue', 'Grant', 'great', 'work', 'are', 'doing', 'seniors']",N/A
