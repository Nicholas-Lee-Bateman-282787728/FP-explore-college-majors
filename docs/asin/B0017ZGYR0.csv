1158257,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B0017ZGYR0,Andres C. Salama,"[13, 15]","One of the most notorious anti Semitic movies ever made, filmed in Germany in 1940, under the close supervision of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. This was based on a real case and a furthernovel by Jewish author Lion Feuchtwanger - obviously, the Nazis completely distorted the source material so that this film is completely anti-Semitic. The movie was a huge success at its time - millions of Germans watched it and SS boss Heinrich Himmler made viewing the movie mandatory for every member of his organization. Today the film is banned in Germany.In 18th century Germany, the foolish duke of Wurttenberg decides to make the Jewish businessman Joseph Suss Oppenheimmer his financial adviser. Soon disaster will come to the dukedom, in the form of a higher cost of living (under advice from Suss, the duke sharply rises all sort of taxes). Suss also advices the duke to let the Jews enter Wurttenberg (from where they were banned from residing). Eventually, the members of Wurttenberg council, decides to rise against the duke and his adviser.Ironically, in some ways the message of the movie looks different today than originally intended. To a modern audience, the Germans in the movie are so nave, ignorant and narrow minded that they seem offputting, while Suss appears to be, until he turns into a rapist and torturer toward the end, not such a bad guy, just a sharp, quick if a bit ethically loose businessman. Putting tolls in the roads of Wurttenberg doesn't look to be such a bad thing, while the politicians of the council opposing Suss seem uptight, arrogant and pompous. The character of Faber seems an unbearable, prejudiced young hothead, while his wife Dorothea, the Christian girl Suss strives for and that will be one of the causes of his downfall (played by Kristina Soderbaum, wife of director Veit Harlan) is so dumb and foolish, one feels she is not really worth the trouble. Even the portrayal of the rabbi of the community seems almost positive to a modern audience: he tells Suss to be very careful in his political dealings with the Germans, lest this backfire on the Jewish community.Ferdinand Marian gives an amazing multifaceted performance as the cunning but magnetic Suss, without him the movie would be far less powerful than it is. Finally, I give this movie a high rating because I think is very well made - I certainly find its message hateful.",4,Very well made if hateful propaganda film,1311379200,"07 23, 2011",2011,2390,"['One', 'most', 'notorious', 'anti', 'Semitic', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'filmed', 'Germany', '1940', 'close', 'supervision', 'Nazi', 'propaganda', 'minister', 'Joseph', 'Goebbels', 'was', 'based', 'real', 'case', 'furthernovel', 'Jewish', 'author', 'Lion', 'Feuchtwanger', 'obviously', 'Nazis', 'completely', 'distorted', 'source', 'material', 'so', 'film', 'completely', 'anti-Semitic', 'movie', 'was', 'huge', 'success', 'time', 'millions', 'Germans', 'watched', 'SS', 'boss', 'Heinrich', 'Himmler', 'made', 'viewing', 'movie', 'mandatory', 'member', 'organization', 'film', 'banned', 'Germany.In', '18th', 'century', 'Germany', 'foolish', 'duke', 'Wurttenberg', 'make', 'Jewish', 'businessman', 'Joseph', 'Suss', 'Oppenheimmer', 'financial', 'adviser', 'Soon', 'disaster', 'will', 'come', 'dukedom', 'form', 'higher', 'cost', 'living', 'advice', 'Suss', 'duke', 'sharply', 'sort', 'taxes', 'Suss', 'also', 'duke', 'let', 'Jews', 'enter', 'Wurttenberg', 'where', 'were', 'banned', 'residing', 'Eventually', 'members', 'Wurttenberg', 'council', 'rise', 'duke', 'adviser.Ironically', 'ways', 'message', 'movie', 'different', 'today', 'originally', 'intended', 'modern', 'audience', 'Germans', 'movie', 'are', 'so', 'nave', 'ignorant', 'narrow', 'minded', 'seem', 'offputting', 'Suss', 'be', 'rapist', 'torturer', 'end', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'just', 'sharp', 'quick', 'bit', 'ethically', 'loose', 'businessman', 'Putting', 'tolls', 'roads', 'Wurttenberg', ""n't"", 'look', 'be', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'politicians', 'council', 'opposing', 'Suss', 'seem', 'uptight', 'arrogant', 'pompous', 'character', 'Faber', 'unbearable', 'prejudiced', 'young', 'hothead', 'wife', 'Dorothea', 'Christian', 'girl', 'Suss', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'causes', 'downfall', 'played', 'Kristina', 'Soderbaum', 'wife', 'director', 'Veit', 'Harlan', 'so', 'dumb', 'foolish', 'one', 'feels', 'not', 'really', 'trouble', 'Even', 'portrayal', 'rabbi', 'community', 'almost', 'positive', 'modern', 'audience', 'Suss', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'political', 'dealings', 'Germans', 'lest', 'backfire', 'Jewish', 'community.Ferdinand', 'Marian', 'amazing', 'multifaceted', 'performance', 'cunning', 'magnetic', 'Suss', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'less', 'powerful', 'Finally', 'give', 'movie', 'high', 'rating', 'think', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'certainly', 'find', 'message', 'hateful']",N/A

The hatred against jewish people began when christianity came out . Any one who didn't convert was persecuted. They didn't counter act this prejudice unitl it was too late, aka the warsaw ghetto, cause they were waiting to be rescued from their version of a savior. Un fortunatley this apathey contribute in giving hitler power. He has already lied to the german against the jewish since they were raised up against them.He and his cronies did the dirty work in mudering innocent people. while average german citizens just expressed verbal hate but did not participate in the murders. The percentage of people who saw the movie were either cowerdly bigots pro nazis as well as those who were a member of the nazi party. Those who didn't vote at all .Those who were against the nazis but were too cowerdly or had given up. The ones who hated the jews and were going to murder them  didn't need negative art to influence them. They would of killed them any how cause no one at the time was stopping them the vicitms wern't fighting back Opps I also forgot the bigotry started in the roman empire and the victims back then were being apathetic cause they were waitng for their savior instead of helping themselves. Another thing that viet and goebels overlooked. Not only the jewish people were portrayed as bad but also the christians. the duke was portrayed as a jail bater. He was crooked too, The rabbi lowe was portrayed as opposing jude suses greed, this makes him a semi positve character and makes the movie more subjective. the christians in this picture break their own law and murder ju sus  and kicked the innocent jewish out of wutterberg. so they too are portrayed as bigots . This film reflect not only anti jewish sentiment but anti christian ones too by th nazis. but seeing it today is no different than seeing birth of a nation. Hypocritically countrys like germany ban the distribution and possesion of jude sus but at the same time allow birth of a nation to be sold and owned not being conserned that it will incite racism.  Might as well allow the other movie too. they allow uncle otto and wunschconzert ,the great love ,bismark to be distributed and thats nazi propaganda films too. don't be afriad to buy or watch this film it help you to keep remembering what hitler did so to s contribute to preventing  another  holicost. no art can force you to hate . you have to already hate.",5,Judd Sus,1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,2699,"['movie', 'was', 'created', 'goebels', 'hitler', 'viet', 'who', 'time', 'was', 'pro', 'nazi', 'anti', 'semetic.Goebels', 'felt', 'people', 'loved', 'movies', 'could', 'actually', 'brain', 'washed', 'watch', 'movies', 'violent', 'hate', 'machine', 'showing', 'typical', 'lunatic', 'hatred', 'jewish', 'people', 'began', 'when', 'christianity', 'came', 'out', 'one', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'convert', 'was', 'persecuted', 'did', ""n't"", 'counter', 'act', 'prejudice', 'unitl', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'aka', 'warsaw', 'ghetto', 'cause', 'were', 'waiting', 'be', 'rescued', 'version', 'savior', 'Un', 'fortunatley', 'apathey', 'contribute', 'giving', 'hitler', 'power', 'already', 'lied', 'german', 'jewish', 'were', 'raised', 'up', 'them.He', 'cronies', 'did', 'dirty', 'work', 'mudering', 'innocent', 'people', 'average', 'german', 'citizens', 'just', 'expressed', 'verbal', 'hate', 'did', 'not', 'participate', 'murders', 'percentage', 'people', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'were', 'either', 'cowerdly', 'bigots', 'pro', 'nazis', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'were', 'member', 'nazi', 'party', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'vote', '.Those', 'who', 'were', 'nazis', 'were', 'too', 'cowerdly', 'had', 'given', 'up', 'ones', 'who', 'hated', 'jews', 'were', 'going', 'murder', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'negative', 'art', 'influence', 'would', 'killed', 'how', 'cause', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'stopping', 'vicitms', 'wer', ""n't"", 'fighting', 'back', 'Opps', 'also', 'forgot', 'bigotry', 'started', 'roman', 'empire', 'victims', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'being', 'apathetic', 'cause', 'were', 'waitng', 'savior', 'instead', 'helping', 'thing', 'viet', 'goebels', 'overlooked', 'Not', 'only', 'jewish', 'people', 'were', 'portrayed', 'bad', 'also', 'christians', 'duke', 'was', 'portrayed', 'jail', 'bater', 'was', 'crooked', 'too', 'rabbi', 'lowe', 'was', 'portrayed', 'opposing', 'jude', 'suses', 'greed', 'semi', 'positve', 'character', 'movie', 'more', 'subjective', 'christians', 'picture', 'break', 'own', 'law', 'murder', 'ju', 'sus', 'kicked', 'innocent', 'jewish', 'wutterberg', 'too', 'are', 'portrayed', 'bigots', 'film', 'reflect', 'not', 'only', 'anti', 'jewish', 'sentiment', 'anti', 'christian', 'ones', 'too', 'th', 'nazis', 'seeing', 'today', 'different', 'seeing', 'birth', 'nation', 'Hypocritically', 'countrys', 'germany', 'ban', 'distribution', 'possesion', 'jude', 'sus', 'same', 'time', 'allow', 'birth', 'nation', 'be', 'sold', 'owned', 'not', 'being', 'conserned', 'will', 'incite', 'racism', 'Might', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'movie', 'too', 'allow', 'uncle', 'otto', 'wunschconzert', 'great', 'love', 'bismark', 'be', 'distributed', 'thats', 'nazi', 'propaganda', 'films', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'afriad', 'buy', 'watch', 'film', 'keep', 'remembering', 'what', 'hitler', 'did', 'so', 's', 'contribute', 'preventing', 'holicost', 'art', 'can', 'force', 'hate', 'have', 'already', 'hate']",N/A

I was pretty shocked.  That tells me that the Nazis not only despised the Jews, they felt intimidated by their intelligence as well.  I also thought that this film, while mainly depicting Jews as evil, showed the Germans to be naive fools who allowed their city and everything in it to be easily taken over by a single Jew.  Honestly, I'm surprised that the German society at the time was not insulted by this film.  If I were German, I would feel insulted, but that was then, and this is now.  Perhaps my perspective is different because times have changed.  A whole country was brainwashed by a mad man, so I suppose people were walking around with blinders on.In a way, although this film depicts those ""evil Jews,"" I also thought it was a knock on German Christian society.  To me, it was like reading between the lines of a book, if you look deeply enough.I feel that this film is an important piece of historical work given the context of the Holocaust and the persecuation of the Jewish people.  However, it should be studied not only as a piece of inflammatory hatred during the worst period in human history, but as a piece that allows us to get into the minds of the perpetrators.",5,Another viewpoint,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,1336,"['one', 'point', 'film', 'character', 'states', 'one', 'as', 'smart', 'Jew', 'Yes', 'was', 'said', 'film', 'movie', 'Hitler', 'approved', 'was', 'pretty', 'shocked', 'Nazis', 'not', 'only', 'despised', 'Jews', 'felt', 'intimidated', 'intelligence', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'thought', 'film', 'mainly', 'depicting', 'Jews', 'evil', 'showed', 'Germans', 'be', 'naive', 'fools', 'who', 'allowed', 'city', 'everything', 'be', 'easily', 'taken', 'over', 'single', 'Jew', 'Honestly', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'German', 'society', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'insulted', 'film', 'were', 'German', 'would', 'feel', 'insulted', 'was', 'then', 'now', 'Perhaps', 'perspective', 'different', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'whole', 'country', 'was', 'brainwashed', 'mad', 'man', 'suppose', 'people', 'were', 'walking', 'around', 'blinders', 'on.In', 'way', 'film', 'evil', 'Jews', 'also', 'thought', 'was', 'knock', 'German', 'Christian', 'society', 'was', 'reading', 'lines', 'book', 'look', 'deeply', 'enough.I', 'feel', 'film', 'important', 'piece', 'historical', 'work', 'given', 'context', 'Holocaust', 'persecuation', 'Jewish', 'people', 'However', 'should', 'be', 'studied', 'not', 'only', 'piece', 'inflammatory', 'hatred', 'worst', 'period', 'human', 'history', 'piece', 'get', 'minds', 'perpetrators']",N/A
