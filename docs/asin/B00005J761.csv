E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Sugar & Spice isn't some groundbreaking form of comedy by any means, and if someone were to believe it's actually an extremely *bad* movie overall, I wouldn't disagree (because it's exceptionally silly) but for what it is (a relatievely harmless film involving cheerleaders) it could certainly be a LOT worse.The writing in the beginning is REALLY bad however.  Please keep this in mind.  It shows a bunch of talkative cheerleaders not really saying anything of note- just being fairly annoying.After the first 20 minutes, the quality of the jokes and the storytelling does improve somewhat.  It improves as soon as you get to know each of the five or six cheerleaders better.It should be noted that even though the description says it's about robbing a bank, the actual robbery doesn't take place until the very end.  The majority of the storyline shows the events that movivated the cheerleaders to rob a bank.Honestly, Sugar & Spice doesn't have a whole lot going for it, but some of the storyline segments brought a smile to my face, and besides some hard to understand cheerleader talk taking place a bit too often (hey, I'm no cheerleader so I'm no expert in THOSE kind of conversations) it's actually pretty funny and tells a decent enough story.",4,"pretty good, though extremely cheesy",1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,1253,"['Sugar', 'Spice', ""n't"", 'groundbreaking', 'form', 'comedy', 'means', 'someone', 'were', 'believe', 'actually', 'extremely', '*bad*', 'movie', 'overall', 'would', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'exceptionally', 'silly', 'what', 'relatievely', 'harmless', 'film', 'involving', 'cheerleaders', 'could', 'certainly', 'be', 'LOT', 'worse.The', 'writing', 'beginning', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'however', 'Please', 'keep', 'mind', 'bunch', 'talkative', 'cheerleaders', 'not', 'really', 'saying', 'anything', 'note-', 'just', 'being', 'fairly', 'annoying.After', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'quality', 'jokes', 'storytelling', 'improve', 'somewhat', 'as', 'soon', 'get', 'know', 'five', 'six', 'cheerleaders', 'better.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'even', 'description', 'robbing', 'bank', 'actual', 'robbery', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'very', 'end', 'majority', 'storyline', 'events', 'movivated', 'cheerleaders', 'rob', 'bank.Honestly', 'Sugar', 'Spice', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'going', 'storyline', 'segments', 'brought', 'smile', 'face', 'hard', 'understand', 'cheerleader', 'talk', 'taking', 'place', 'bit', 'too', 'often', 'hey', ""'m"", 'cheerleader', 'so', ""'m"", 'expert', 'THOSE', 'kind', 'conversations', 'actually', 'pretty', 'funny', 'decent', 'enough', 'story']",N/A

Only this time it isn't the boy-meets-girl boy-falls-in-love-with-gril boy-and-girl-have-problems-but-in-the-end-all-is-good storyline. It's about five cheerleaders (and Fern later on!), who are different from each other but still close- so close they even get their periods at the same time. When the head cheerleader realizes she doesn't have enough money for her unborn children, they deciede to rob a bank to help her out. How can you not love this movie?The actresses are super talented too, and each carictor has a special flaw that has to make you smile. Mellisa George plays Cleo, who's obbessed with Conan O'Brien (Just thought I'd add that Conan is the man!). Mena Suvari plays Kansas, a rebel who's mom is giving them tips on how to commit the robbery. Rachel Blanchard  plays Hannah, a good christian girl who had her first orgasm while riding a horse at band camp. Marla Sokoloff plays Lisa, the B-sqaud cheerleader who's out for the A-squad girls. Sara Marsh plays Lucy, the brian who has second thoughts. As Fern, Alexandra Holden is the newest cheerleader and daughter of an extermenator. And Diane rounds out the bunch as the oh-so-sweet head cheerleader, played by Marley Shelton.

This should have been a really good movie.This was not a really good movie.The idea was great. Five Cheerleaders hold up a bank. It could have made for an interesting counterpoint in today's world of teensploitation films (a genre, which I will admit to enjoying). However, it failed in its execution. I think the Nelson and McDougall (writer and director, respectively) were looking for a dark comedy with deep social implications, but instead we are left with a weakly plotted string of not so funny one-off jokes.All things considered, the acting is decent, especially on the parts of Marla Sokoloff and Mena Suvari (both of whom, I am looking forward to seeing in more and greater roles), and yes, if you care, the girls are all cute. But it ends there. If you're looking for substance, and better executed dark comedies with similar themes or styles, I would suggest &quot;But I'm a Cheerleader&quot; or &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous.&quot; If you are looking for a good cheerleading movie, then go see &quot;Bring it On&quot;. If you are simply looking for cheesecake.

Lisa just cracks me up with her evil little jokes about the A-Squad she definatly steals the movie! As Lisa is narrarating the five A-Squad cheerleaders seem to have supporting roles until BAM! Diane(Marley Shelton) gets pregnet, now all of the other squad members get involved.Now, I personally enjoyed the prefrmance given by Mellisa George who playes Cleo (she's OBSESSED w/Conan O' Brian) she is SO funny. My friends say the liked Mena Suvari's performace as Kansas the foul mouthed tough girl. Me personally, I think with Mena Suvari who is such a great actress they could've given her more than just a supporting character. But she is still great!As the movie goes on the girls ""reserch"", practice, and finally perform the hilarous bank robbery. The robbery is definetly the best part of the movie!

This movie has more than just Mena in a cheerleading outfit, though--it has several other attractive young ladies in cheerleading outfits.  Mena aside, this is just a fun and entertaining movie.  There are some people who would call this movie lame and silly, but who cares about those overly serious people?  All movies don't have to be dramatic passion plays that enrich and inform our lives.  Sometimes, there is nothing better than a good, &quot;dumb&quot; high school movie, and this is one of the better ones.  A group of &quot;A Squad&quot; cheerleaders end up robbing a bank in order to help support the unborn twins of the head cheerleader, who continues cheering into her seventh month of pregnancy.  In the process, hilarity ensues.  It's a funny movie, and that is all it is intended to be.  It won't win a Best Picture Oscar, but it provides a welcome escape from reality.For obvious reasons, I'm sure this movie will appeal more to male viewers than to females.  The girls in this movie are gorgeous, especially Mena (of course).  In a way, this movie portrays young women asserting themselves, working together to accomplish their goals, so maybe there is some educational value in it.  Or maybe not.  It annoys me to see other people saying things about how this movie could be a bad influence on youngsters.  So the main characters gets pregnant and ends up getting her friends to help her rob a bank.  If there has been a rash of pregnant, teenaged cheerleaders dressing up as Betty dolls and robbing banks since this movie came out, it's news to me.  This is comedy, folks.  The cast is great, and one reason they are all great is because they all overplay their characters to maximize the levels of satire and comedy.  It is an insult to today's youth (which I am slightly too old to still be included with, unfortunately) to claim that a film such as this is going to &quot;influence&quot; them to be immoral.  Today's youth understand comedy and entertainment; they know you should not take everything in life too seriously.  They also know that a movie does not have to &quot;make a point,&quot; as one reviewer argues.  This movie made me laugh, and I enjoyed it from start to finish.

582732,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00005J761,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","In a police station  in a midwestern town, an impatient and irreverent Lincoln High School B-Squad cheerleader named Lisa Janusch (Marla Sokoloff) begins her testimony about a recent  robbery at a local supermarket bank branch, which, for her, included a very close confrontation with one of the perpetrators.Noticeably, when she is not in her red, white, and blue cheerleading uniform, her predominant color of apparel is green--a color that symbolizes her envy of the two central figures in this story, the captain of the  cheerleading A-Squad, Diane Weston (a deceptively mild and innocent looking Marley Shelton), and the star quarterback, Jack Bartlett(a toothy James Marsden, who has a rather demonic beauty).The adults are viewed from Lisa's teenaged perspective. That is to say as dorky and out of touch, and her lack of respect for them could not be more obvious.But she directs most of her venom at Diane in commentary that very thinly veils her envy of Diane's beauty, popularity, and upbeat attitude, especially since she herself is coming out of an ugly duckling phase.Jack Bartlett is a recent transfer student to Lincoln High, and Lisa cannot hide her bitterness over the fact that no other girl besides Diane ever had a chance of winning him once the two literally collided with each other at a pep rally.Their relationship takes an unexpected turn when Diane becomes pregnant by Jack. While he boasts about impending fatherhood to his teammates on Prom Night, the same news is met with emotion, some apprehension and ultimately support by Diane's fellow A-Squad members including the pious Hannah Wald(Rachel Blanchard), the Conan O'Brien obsessed Cleo Miller (Melissa George), the scholarly Lucy Whitman(Sarah Marsh), and the gruff Kansas Hill ( Mena Suvari), whose mother(Sean Young) is doing a prison term--from which a major plot point arises.Expelled from their respective homes, Jack and Diane take up residence in a seedy apartment with a landlord of questionable repute, are compelled to find jobs (Jack's blatant honesty and ineptitude combine to cost him a few of those), and deal with school, sports, and cheerleading  combined, and the situation gradually takes its toll.During a sleepover with the A-Squad members, Diane comes up with the idea of robbing the bank branch where she works, after lamenting her moneyless plight, as she watches a tape of Keanu Reeves in ""Point Break"". While Lucy objects to the idea, Kansas is the first to support it, expressing a willingness to add to her own family's dubious history.The girls pay a visit to Kansas' mother and her inmates, and get a tip on where to buy ammunition for the heist. They are led to Hank ""Terminator"" Rogers (W. Earl Brown), who agrees to waive the fee for the contraband rifles if the girls agree to let his daughter, Fern (Alexandra Holden) join the squad.Interspersed with all this are Lisa's skewered views of Fern's performance at the winter pep rally and her refusal to take responsibility for her own failure to impress the crowd at that event.There is an amusingly precarious scene when Kansas' grandmother(Claudia Wilkins) almost catches the girls with the chest full of ammo as they are in the basement of Kansas' house that illustrates the need for the older generation to be a little less naive and pay attention to what the youngsters are really up to.After learning that Jack sold the intended getaway car, the girls find a less-than-desireable way to travel. Donning Betty Doll masks and costumes( Lucy, who initially bowed out, rejoins them disguised as Nixon), they carry off the heist, unaware that Lisa is witnessing the deed and has gathered evidence against them.The hysteria over the robbery leads to wrongful accusations while the real culprits go on with their lives. For a brief time, Diane enjoys the items bought for her forthcoming twins with the ill-gotten gains, and rationalizes what she has done.But when the law catches up to A-Squad, events take an unexpected turn, and the girls are released from their holding cell.The comical ending reveals the fate of each squad member, and a fun sing-along by the Weird Al Yankovic sound-alike group, Size 14.My final recommendation regarding Francine McDougall's twisted farce: Let it amuse you as much as possible, kids.

The only reason I watched it(well, I rented it thinking it looked funny and something different for a teen movie) was that there was absolutely nothing on the 126 channels I have on Direct TV.

It had a great screenplay with very funny dialogue.  Whereas S&amp;S had such bad writing.  Also, Heathers had Winona Ryder, who is a great actress.

But for some of us it might just be the perfect antidote to some of our sour high school memories of pompousness. If you went to a school with plenty of pompousness and one where cheerleaders are virtually worshipped as goddesses and as an utterly unattainable standard for the rest of us, here's a no-holds-barred deflation of all that. It is sometimes hilarious, and I think I must speak for quite a few viewers when I say it is a thoroughly refreshing de-bunking of those myths that still haunt some of our teen memories. The cheerleaders in this movie are a motley crew of girls -- there's a super-popular one, there's a &quot;trampy&quot; one whose mother is in prison, and there's a super-pious one, out to retain her virginity (at least supposedly so!). But this movie brings them all down to the same earthy level and says cheerleaders can be real doofuses to all the extent of the other doofuses you knew in high school. SUGAR AND SPICE can really give one a feeling that there's not much difference after all between those school icons you most envied or wanted to emulate and their unfortunate classmates who were the butts of the most cruel jokes. At least one other recent movie seemed to celebrate and exult cheerleading as if it were the most serious and important sport since kickboxing. I guess there's a legitimate audience for such things. Some do take cheerleading very seriously, and not all of them should be assumed as having any intent of putting the rest of us &quot;in our place&quot;. So let them be entitled to their serious cheerleading movies. But for so many of the rest of us, I must suppose, such a movie only reinforced those old memories of social stratification in school, seeming to waste some promising young acting talent in the process.

Martin ""ffej26""","[2, 5]","I was expecting awful things from this movie, but was pleasently surprised when it turned out to be a funny, cute, and soemtimes corny comedy about a group of high school cheerleaders who rob a bank in order to get money for Diane to she can afford her baby. All of the actresses seem to be having the time of thier lives in their roles. Especially Marley Shelton. She is stunning and makes you want her to succeed in robbing the bank. Marla Sokoloff is equally engaging as the B squad member who narrates the story, and has it in for the cheerleaders. However the the other cast memebrs are wasted in this film and are too talented to be doing such a light fluff/corny movie. Mena Suvari is good as the rebel Kansas, and sometimes I got the impression from her that she was like &quot;I can't believe I'm doing this movie&quot;. After an amazing turn in American Beauty, she deserves better than a supporting character. I personally would of like to have seen her in the role of Diane. James Marsden is way over the top as the boyfriend Jack. He is so annoying, but I'm sure he wasn't cast in this role for his amazing acting skills. I usually do like him in movies, but he went a little too far with this one. The film has it's cute moments and the robbing the bank scene is quite funny.

That basic summary doesn't do justice to the slick and often laugh outloud hilarious writing.  Once in awhile a rather stiff actor sneaks into a scene (Dave Quimby, the apartment manager for example) but on the whole the main cast hold their own, proving just because it's a movie with teens, it need not be some banal  teen movie (American Pie, Final Destination, etc).From amusing homages to Reservoir Dogs to Madonna lyrics used to justify a decision, this film comes fully packed for the savvy moviegoer.  Not since Heathers or the even more brilliant Real Genius has a satirical look at youth been so on the money.I recall enjoying Kirsten Dunst's Bring It On, but felt the movie hadn't gone far enough.  The jokes were good, but hardly biting or smart.  Sugar &amp; Spice blows away that &quot;other&quot; cheerleading film with a far sharper eye on teens and parents.  No sense in mocking it unless you're gonna pull out all the stops and tear apart every person in your path...from supermarket checkers, to hicks, to parents and cops, not one group escapes unscathed.Marla Sokoloff's Lisa comes off perfectly as the sweet natured, though not always smart leader of this band.  Even better, James Marsden as Jack shows he can actually have a goofy character, capturing the essence of the average clueless high school jock.  Marsden's orgasmic shudder after describing a perfect touchdown pass will always call forth a hearty laugh from me. His video co-workers are perfectly cast as well.  Diane's parents introducing themselves to Jack's family also comes across as cinema gold.  The remaining characters fulfill the whole range of stereotypical high school characters.  God bless the writer and director for remaining true to their vision and keeping those stereotyped characters.  The whole point of satire is to play it up, not show us a cheerleader who reads Voltaire and ponders Quantum Physics.I could babble endlessly about how much fun this little gem turned out to be, but alas it would eventually, if not already, come across as redundant.  Too bad the DVD's stripped to the bone.  I'd love to discover that the twisted folks who can recite Real Genius lines are finding this film on DVD/VHS.

When I sat in the theatre on the opening night I saw that it was half empty but that didn't bother me. I understand why this movie didn't work: It was suppose to be a really dark comedy, it was originally rated R but they changed the script so it would be rated PG-13 but everyone knows that most R rated movies that are aimed at teens(American Pie is an exception) usually flop.

This was disappointing in comparison to Bring It On.The actresses are fab in this however - look out for a black-haired Melissa George (was Angel in Home & Away, and was also in Friends), who's virtually unrecognisable! Also Alexandra Holden comes in half way through (was also in Friends, and Tru Calling), and Marla Sokoloff (ALSO in Friends), Marley Shelton & Mena Suvari do a good job, with what little they have to do in the film, with their two-dimensional roles. They dress up as Betty Dolls (which I've never seen in the UK), and each one plays a different Betty Doll. The Bettys are: Diane - ""Mood Swing"" Betty; Kansas - ""White Trash"" Betty; Cleo - ""Stalker"" Betty; Hannah - ""Virgin"" Betty (with optional horse and saddle); Fern - ""Terminator"" Betty and Lucy - Richard Nixon. (Obviously another nod to Point Break.)The storyline's pretty standard for a teen movie. Lead star (who looks like Heather Graham) gets pregnant, move into their own home, and promptly run out of money. So while watching Point Break (yes, you do get a glimpse of Keanu during this), they decide to rob a bank. And it goes off without a hitch.The movie's not that long, only 73 minutes, with two minutes of ""where are they now?"" and six minutes of credits for a running time of 81 minutes.

While it had it's moments of halarity (is that even a word), it ultimately delivered a potencially funny premise in a pretty implausible manner.  Perhaps my favorite cast member was Marla Sokoloff as her character, Lisa ""The Informer"" Janusch, seemed to be the only level-headed one.  And, being a crime buff, I would have liked to see hints of a bigger police investigation before the cheerleaders were ratted out...build the tension and all that.  After all, the police officer in the beginning of the film had emphasized how serious a crime this robbery had been...at that point, you'd have thought he was trying to nail HannibalLector for murder, but no such luck.  This is a film where your own judgement on whether or not to watch it is key as I cannot in good conscience make a recommendation either way.

Diane (Marley Shelton) is the A-squad captain for Lincoln High who suddenly gets pregnant by Jack (James Marsden). When the couple starts living on their own, Diane realizes they can't afford things just on Jack's salary at the video store. That is when she decides to work at the grocery store-bank branch to make some extra cash. She comes up with a crazy idea to rob the bank because ""money makes your dreams come true"" and she knows the bank branch well making it an easy break in. Sugar and Spice is funny and original.

It's a sweet yet sour comedy about the A-squad cheerleaders and their sister-like friendship as they all unite to help the head cheerleader, Diane (played by adorable Marley Shelton) and her quarterback boyfriend support the twins they're expecting. I watched this movie not knowing anything about it, and I honestly thought as soon as Diane learns she's pregnant and gives her boyfriend the news, that he was going to leave her, but he couldn't have been more happy. In fact, the only people upset with the news are their parents who disown them, leaving the young couple to fend for themselves. They marry and take minimum wage jobs to pay for their apartment and the expected twins, but it's not enough. But that doesn't stop the A-squad from coming up with a heist plan sure to give the couple the cash they need to care for their babies. Told from the point of view of a bitter B-squad cheerleader, this is one of those fun movies like Mean Girls that's funny yet sweet without being too sugary. It will leave you cheering for these good bad girls the entire way.

However, if you like those girls (and campy acting & dialogues) and ignore the silliy story, this film might hopefully provide some good time.  And at least it is not long (about 80 minute long).The story?  Nothing particularly important except those A Squad cheerleaders at Lincoln High, one of whom falls in love with a hunky football player.  And she gets pregnant.  And they start to live together, but the life is not easy financially, so the friends in the cheerleading squad decide to help her.  Now, they think, it's time for a bank robbery.You get many, many shots of these girls, all of them bing stock types -- including foul-mouthed, spit-firing Mena Suvari -- so there is nothing new or original in the hackneyed portraits of American high school life.  Plus, the story is too incredible or stupid to take seriously so there is no way of watching it as a satire.  Some viewer would be offended by what the characters do, and it is understandable.  It is surely very irritating for most of us to watch irreponsible people hanging around you, chatting silly things near you, and without any intention or purpose for them to act that way.But on one level the film barely succeeds, and that is its unshamedness; it unashamedly uses Ms. Suvari again after  her ""American Beauty"" role; it unahamedly uses Sean Young, who did the similar role in ""Poor White Trash.""  They never hesitate to make use of classic heist movies (including Tarantino and others), and the company actually use the footages from those  films (with permission, of course).  And most of all, ""S & S"" never loses moments to capitalize the beauty and sexiness of the girls, and the young female players respond to the request of the director with knowingly campy acting.  When you see these girls ""pose"" with pom-pom before the police witness (!) in the opening credit, you know what you are going to see.The gags are uninspired, and the ideas are just average ones, but because of these girls I find strangely attractive, I rather enjoyed watching it.  Still, the ride could be funnier with better script, which does not ignore the fact that no longer can the filmmakers make fun of cheerleading in the way they did here after the success of ""Bring it on.""",3,"Nothing Inpired, But Still Some Fun Because of Those Girls",1033603200,"10 3, 2002",2002,2457,"['Strangely', 'enough', 'film', 'compared', 'Bring', 'prefer', 'much', 'Sugar', 'Spice', 'completely', 'different', 'league', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'exciting', 'cheerleading', 'competion', 'scenes', 'lovely', 'Kirstin', 'Dunst', 'However', 'like', 'girls', 'campy', 'acting', 'dialogues', 'ignore', 'silliy', 'story', 'film', 'might', 'hopefully', 'provide', 'good', 'time', 'least', 'not', 'long', '80', 'minute', 'long', '.The', 'story', 'Nothing', 'particularly', 'important', 'A', 'Squad', 'cheerleaders', 'Lincoln', 'High', 'one', 'whom', 'falls', 'love', 'hunky', 'football', 'player', 'pregnant', 'start', 'live', 'together', 'life', 'not', 'easy', 'financially', 'friends', 'cheerleading', 'squad', 'decide', 'help', 'Now', 'think', 'time', 'bank', 'robbery.You', 'get', 'many', 'many', 'shots', 'girls', 'bing', 'stock', 'types', 'including', 'foul-mouthed', 'spit-firing', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'so', 'nothing', 'new', 'original', 'hackneyed', 'portraits', 'American', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'story', 'too', 'incredible', 'stupid', 'take', 'seriously', 'so', 'way', 'watching', 'satire', 'viewer', 'would', 'be', 'offended', 'what', 'characters', 'do', 'understandable', 'surely', 'very', 'irritating', 'most', 'watch', 'irreponsible', 'people', 'hanging', 'chatting', 'silly', 'things', 'intention', 'purpose', 'act', 'way.But', 'one', 'level', 'film', 'barely', 'unshamedness', 'unashamedly', 'Ms.', 'Suvari', 'again', 'American', 'Beauty', 'role', 'unahamedly', 'Sean', 'Young', 'who', 'did', 'similar', 'role', 'Poor', 'White', 'Trash', 'never', 'hesitate', 'make', 'use', 'classic', 'heist', 'movies', 'including', 'Tarantino', 'others', 'company', 'actually', 'use', 'footages', 'films', 'permission', 'course', 'most', 'S', 'S', 'never', 'moments', 'capitalize', 'beauty', 'sexiness', 'girls', 'young', 'female', 'players', 'respond', 'request', 'director', 'knowingly', 'campy', 'acting', 'When', 'see', 'girls', 'pose', 'pom-pom', 'police', 'witness', 'opening', 'credit', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'see.The', 'gags', 'are', 'uninspired', 'ideas', 'are', 'just', 'average', 'ones', 'girls', 'find', 'strangely', 'attractive', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Still', 'ride', 'could', 'be', 'funnier', 'better', 'script', 'not', 'ignore', 'fact', 'longer', 'can', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'fun', 'cheerleading', 'way', 'did', 'here', 'success', 'Bring']",N/A
