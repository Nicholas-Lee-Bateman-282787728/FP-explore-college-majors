That's the note that John Candy and company hit resoundingly in this masterpiece of comedy and yet exposes a world many North Americans have never known even existed in their midst.,5,Growing Up Canadian,1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,634,"['who', 'grew', 'up', 'search', 'identity', 'coming', 'one', 'many', 'colourful', 'ethnic', 'enclaves', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'parents', 'were', 'part', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'much', 'home', 'earlier', 'version', 'undertones', 'be', 'found', 'My', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'great', 'divide', 'non-Anglo', 'Saxon', 'adapting', 'yet', 'maintaining', 'something', 'roots', 'values', 'are', 'often', 'expressed', 'music', 'note', 'John', 'Candy', 'company', 'hit', 'resoundingly', 'masterpiece', 'comedy', 'yet', 'world', 'many', 'North', 'Americans', 'have', 'never', 'known', 'even', 'existed', 'midst']",Shmenges:Last Polka VHS

It's a mockumentary about 2 ""famous"" polka musicians, and their band and associates. Rick Moranis is incredibly funny in this (as The Shmenges lead singer), as are the rest of the cast.  I wish that someone would release a collection of all of The Shmenge Brothers SCTV Skits - I'd pay top dollar for that!  Also there needs to be a DVD/re-release/distribution of ""The Last Polka"".

They have their satire so perfect that they even included facial moles!! I bought a copy of this on Amazon some years ago and am very afraid to play it more than every once in a while for an unsuspecting houseguest because I don't want to ruin it. I want this on DVD. I thought I would need oxygen from laughing so hard at the tuba solo. Now this is what I call genius!,5,I want this on DVD,1265673600,"02 9, 2010",2010,489,"['happen', 'BE', 'polka', 'fan', 'portrayal', 'polka', 'kings', 'not', 'very', 'far', 'corny', 'humor', 'right', 'target', 'have', 'satire', 'perfect', 'even', 'included', 'facial', 'moles', 'bought', 'copy', 'Amazon', 'years', 'ago', 'am', 'very', 'afraid', 'play', 'more', 'once', 'while', 'unsuspecting', 'houseguest', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'want', 'DVD', 'thought', 'would', 'need', 'oxygen', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'tuba', 'solo', 'Now', 'what', 'call', 'genius']",Shmenges:Last Polka VHS

I really need a good clean copy. If you are a John Candy fan and haven't seen this, get it. Eugene Levy and John Candy as Yosh And Stan Shmenge, put the finishing touches on the characters they played for years on SCTV. Rick Moranis reprises his role as a Litonian crooner and performs such songs as the Doors ""Touch Me"" as a Polka. Yosh and Stan performing their Polka tribute to Michael Jackson is hilarious. Get this video if you can.
