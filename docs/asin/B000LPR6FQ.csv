1039819,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B000LPR6FQ,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[2, 3]","Good documentary, but leaving out Dead Kennedys and the Misfits is like doing a documentary on hippie culture and leaving out, I don't know, Jimi Hendrix and the Greatful Dead. I find mistakes that are this obvious really annoying. You wonder what the makers of the film were thinking. Another oddity is some bands getting as much attention as Minor Threat, or Black Flag. It's democratic giving everyone some time to tell their story and that's in the spirit of that scene, but there are some bands that were the primary influences and really got sh** going.In anycase, AMERICAN HARDCORE serves as an incomplete and warped history, but it's an entertaining one. It is definitely still worth taking a look at if you have an interest in punk rock, for sure. I don't know how much someone with a basic familiarity with this culture will actually learn, but you'll enjoy seeing all these guys reminisce. Clearly the hardcore scene was one of the most vital and important culural movements of the last 30 years. I had to laugh at the comments made at the end about punk being dead. Tell that to some people I've known over the years!

First of all there's too much focus on Black Flag, yah I know they were great, but there plenty of other bands that should have gotten screen time. No mention of D.R.I, Government Issue, Negative Approach or any of the other great punk bands.The Dead Kennedy's don't even get a mention, nor do The Misfits. The New York part is fairly lacking, but then again this documentary makes to notion that only LA and Boston made hardcore, while other cites got snubbed.

I continued to listen to a Led Zeppelin and Styx on my Sony Walkman and didn't give it a second thought.  Then someone turned my on to Oingo Boingo, and my journey to punk began.  It was actually Bad Religion and GBH back in 1982 that did for me.  My love of punk would continue to this day.With that said, I was thrilled to rent this DVD.  Lots of great footage and lots of great memories.  Plenty of footage of Black Flag, arguably the greatest hardcore band ever.  But punk in 1982-1984 was more than the bands that are in the movie.  Even if they couldn't get the Dead Kennedy's to be in the film, it is inexcusable why they weren't included.  And you what about the fanzines?  Flipside was huge.  And what about the record stores that carried punk? What about Fear?  And I loved Kraut.I'm thinking of going to gigs at the Olympic Auditorium (a friend worked for Goldenvoice) and all the other punk bands that were a part of the movement.  I guess many were English, and by definition, they couldn't be included in the film.Maybe there were just so many bands that they couldn't all be included, but to me there is so much left out.But with that said, I still enjoyed the movie.

1039822,AGCOCRW8A56U8,B000LPR6FQ,buddyhead,"[10, 14]","This documentary tackled an awful lot, and would have been better off as a longer series.  Too bad the subject matter is too intense for Ken Burns- I could have watched another 10 hours of this stuff, especially if it was organized better than American Hardcore's presentation.  Although the film gave a rough chronologic and geographic guide (repeated use of a US map showing band logos over their city of origin was helpful), the production was hurried, and the editing minimal; everything seemed aimed at cramming as much interview and performance footage as possible into 100 minutes.A big problem with American Hardcore's over-inclusiveness is that no one was presented as seminal to the hardcore movement.  Everyone was glommed together, and to the uninformed, no band made a bigger splash than any other.  Were the musicians interviewed for this movie ALL that big, or were some merely more available than others?  The Dead Kennedys weren't featured at all, and to my mind, Black Flag and Minor Threat were given equal footing with Flipper, Gang Green, The Cro-Mags, D.O.A., The Necros, and The Zero Boys.As viewers are reminded throughout the documentary, hardcore music was a fantastic, organic, filthy, DIY, aggressive reaction against the Framptons and Fleetwood Macs of the world.  However, it, too, was a scene, albeit a purer one with fewer materialistic aims.  The music was formulaic and not all that listenable, with a few exceptions like Bad Brains, and the artists almost to a person took themselves too seriously (Keith Morris of Circle Jerks is particularly bad in the film's interviews).  Hardcore was an anti-movement more than anything else, and few of the musician's ideals were borne of much more than a conspicuous wish to buck trends (hate your parents, hate Ron Reagan, keep your hair short and your clothes black... ho hum).A great interview clip from Mike Dean of Corrosion of Conformity in the extras (all which are excellent, and there's a ton of them) hits the nail on the head: a lot of hardcore involved conforming to the ideals and behaviors of non-conformity.",3,"Fascinating, but Choppy and Over-Inclusive",1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,2097,"['documentary', 'tackled', 'awful', 'lot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'longer', 'series', 'Too', 'bad', 'subject', 'matter', 'too', 'intense', 'Ken', 'Burns-', 'could', 'have', 'watched', '10', 'hours', 'stuff', 'especially', 'was', 'organized', 'better', 'American', 'Hardcore', 'presentation', 'film', 'gave', 'rough', 'chronologic', 'geographic', 'guide', 'repeated', 'use', 'US', 'map', 'showing', 'band', 'logos', 'city', 'origin', 'was', 'helpful', 'production', 'was', 'hurried', 'editing', 'minimal', 'everything', 'seemed', 'aimed', 'cramming', 'as', 'much', 'interview', 'performance', 'footage', 'possible', '100', 'minutes.A', 'big', 'problem', 'American', 'Hardcore', 'over-inclusiveness', 'one', 'was', 'presented', 'seminal', 'hardcore', 'movement', 'Everyone', 'was', 'glommed', 'together', 'uninformed', 'band', 'made', 'bigger', 'splash', 'other', 'musicians', 'interviewed', 'movie', 'big', 'were', 'merely', 'more', 'available', 'others', 'Dead', 'Kennedys', 'were', ""n't"", 'featured', 'mind', 'Black', 'Flag', 'Minor', 'Threat', 'were', 'given', 'equal', 'footing', 'Flipper', 'Gang', 'Green', 'Cro-Mags', 'D.O.A.', 'Necros', 'Zero', 'Boys.As', 'viewers', 'are', 'reminded', 'documentary', 'hardcore', 'music', 'was', 'fantastic', 'organic', 'filthy', 'DIY', 'aggressive', 'reaction', 'Framptons', 'Fleetwood', 'Macs', 'world', 'However', 'too', 'was', 'scene', 'purer', 'one', 'fewer', 'materialistic', 'aims', 'music', 'was', 'formulaic', 'not', 'listenable', 'few', 'exceptions', 'Bad', 'Brains', 'artists', 'almost', 'person', 'took', 'too', 'seriously', 'Keith', 'Morris', 'Circle', 'Jerks', 'particularly', 'bad', 'film', 'interviews', 'Hardcore', 'was', 'anti-movement', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'few', 'musician', 'ideals', 'were', 'borne', 'much', 'more', 'conspicuous', 'wish', 'buck', 'trends', 'hate', 'parents', 'hate', 'Ron', 'Reagan', 'keep', 'hair', 'short', 'clothes', 'black', 'ho', 'hum', 'great', 'interview', 'clip', 'Mike', 'Dean', 'Corrosion', 'Conformity', 'extras', 'are', 'excellent', 'ton', 'nail', 'head', 'lot', 'hardcore', 'involved', 'conforming', 'ideals', 'behaviors', 'non-conformity']",American Hardcore
1039823,A2LWUNJVOGYUIM,B000LPR6FQ,Chad Radford,"[0, 0]","""American Hardcore"" is an excellent film for fans of American hardcore punk rock from the early to mid-1980's.  It begins the history of the political and cultural climate of the era when Ronald Reagan takes office as president and the country shifts far to the right.  His presidency sees a shift to return American life and culture to the conformity of the 1980's.  At the same time, there is a crippling recession going on.  Punk rock took a severe turn to the left in response to flip a finger in the face of this new age of conservative conformity.  The film covers the scenes in California, Washington, D.C., New York, and all points in between.  It includes interviews with the hardcore punk artists as well as their roadies and friends who were there when it happened.  They tell a lot of very interesting stories from that time and you really get a feel for what it was like in the American hardcore scene at that time.  Also, the film is chuck-full of footage from a ton of the bands as they performed in crappy clubs and anywhere else they could play.  Fans of American hardcore music need to buy this movie.

The mystique surrounding early 80s American punk quickly becomes tiresome nostalgia as Keith Morris and other influential hardcore pioneers talk at length about what was obviously the most important part of hardcore punk: themselves. Fun for the bits of video that illustrate the history of happenings largely confined to books and word of mouth, but most people don't  really care about seeing an old-ass H.R. or hearing Henry Rollins crack another joke, or God help us Ian McKaye droning on about the authentic somesuch nonsense. Listening to a handful of albums by Black Flag, Bad Brains, the Circle Jerks, the Vandals, Minor Threat, etc. would distill more of the essence of hardcore than watching this film. It suffers too much from the Dogtown/Z Boys syndrome of ""Boy weren't we cool--just ask us."" However, some of the darker side of the scene is detailed, which you won't necessarily hear about in other accounts: the violent mooks of DC, New York and Boston who shared much in common with street gangs and redneck gay-bashers, and the head-scratching account of some guy from TSOL pissing on unconscious people because, well, F you, that's punk.

Many of the interviews (H.R. and Greg Ginn in particular) offer rare insight into the birth of a musical (or is it anti-musical?) revolution.  The live footage is often exciting, but also makes me wish they'd included more, and longer, live clips rather than brief excerpts.  (And why isn't there a single Black Flag song in the extras?)The significance of lesser known punk bands like the Zero Boys who had to, in effect, create their entire scene in midwestern cities where no sort of counter-culture even existed, cannot be overlooked.  This film does a nice job of depicting the grass-roots development and diffusion of punnk rock throughout the land, as bands from different cities helped each other out in arranging shows (and providing local floors to sleep on).  ""American Hardcore"" does a nice job of documenting an underground phenomenon.It also reveals the most obvious reason why that phenomenon, for the most part, remained underground: virtually all of these bands, even many of the more well-known ones, sound identical.  Part of punk's rallying cry was always a revolt against the formulaic, predictable sounds of mainstream rock and pop, and yet band after band, song after song, punk rock was typically nothing more than a strict 4/4, bass-snare-bass-snare (while riding the high hat) beat, a couple of power chords, and shouted vocals that are completely unintelligible.  That routine gets old after a while, but few punk bands could evolve past it.Although it would probably be impossible to include every single important punk band in a single documentary overview, there is no conceivable reason for the omission of arguably the most important punk rock band in American history - San Francisco's Dead Kennedys.  Did Jello refuse to participate in this nostalgia trip?  Well, I have no doubt East Bay Ray would have been happy to be interviewed.  A punk documentary without the DK's is just incomprehensible.Many other significant bands like the Germs, Suicidal Tendencies and Husker Du get nothing more than a quick name-check.  That's just not acceptable for a documentary on ""American Hardcore.""Sure, you get a lot of magic moments: Greg Ginn referring to Henry Rollins as ""a nice guy""; Ian Mackaye's lucid, articulate recollections of the birth of Dischord records and the Washington D.C. punk movement; the truly incredible rags-to-riches story of Mugger, Black Flag's main roadie; the reminiscences of Bad Brains singer H.R., bassist Darryl Jennifer and guitarist Dr. Know; and many other interviews with scene veterans.  The director does an excellent job of juxtaposing interview snippets with live footage.  But there is so, so much missing from the story as it is told here.

This is pretty much The Bad Brains/Black Flag story with other bands squeezed in here and there. If you are already into hardcore music then nothing new is presented here. It was cool however seeing all those band logos stretched wide on a massive screen. The omission of the Dead Kennedys was glaring, but maybe they were too intelligent for what this film is trying to present hardcore as.One thing thats bothersome is that the movie claims hardcore ended in the mid-80s when it never really ended. You can't tell me that when there are thousands of hardcore bands playing today with thousands of shows all over America in basements, VFW halls, warehouses, house parties, and even ole fashioned venues. And yes its still actual hardcore. This movie is without a doubt for those who thought punk started with The Ramones and ended with The Sex Pistols and know little more.

It is either depressing or reassuring (haven't decided which) to realize the middle aged punks are as full of crap as the middle aged hippies were.Of course, now - all these years later - they have well thought out reasons for the music and their involvement in it.  It seems these boys (and they were all boys then) sat down and thought out the political and social ramifications of the movement they were involved with.  It was all about politics and equality.The highlights include Henry Rollins telling us ""...bands were starting to network.""  Network....Bad Brains wallowing in their greatness of yesteryear.

1039830,A17BUUBOU0598B,B000LPR6FQ,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[38, 39]","American Hardcoreis not a definitive history of hardcore music or punk rock.  It's a documentary about a connected group of hardcore music scenes in cities across the USA.  The documentary isn't only about the music but more about the culture of hardcore and the world inside and outside of the scene.While there are some shortcomings to American Hardcore, all of them fade away once you start making your way through the special features.  I will list both positives and negatives as I see them.  But overall I still feel this movie is an important historical work.To me, I think the filmmakers chose select musicians based largely upon a subjective definition of ""hardcore"" as a smaller part of the punk scene.  As such, it is true that some groups were excluded.  Yet it should be noted that there are other movies on the much larger punk scene.  Legal issues surrounding certain groups also played a part in some of them being excluded.  I think the criticism about the missing or lightly covered bands, while valid, has been over-emphasized.When you watch this movie from start to finish as a sociological documentary on the hard-core culture, you will come away with a very good feel for the many different and diverse sub-cultures within the scene.  That in and of itself is a great accomplishment.One of the things we learn is the role of gay and minority musicians within the scene.  This helps to eliminate the misconceptions about who made this music and who it was against.  Another thing is also clear from the groups profiled in this movie: musicianship ranged from really poor to exceptional, and at the very top of that hierarchy was Bad Brains.  The larger question of who was the ""best"" group is left untouched, which has created some backlash from hardcore purists who were expecting their favorites to be highlighted.The ConsThe documentary itself could have been better edited.  The film is made up of clips of different former hardcore scene members discussing aspects of the music and the times.  There seem to be way too many cuts from one person to the next, and they often move too quickly.  While they have their names repeatedly captioned, I found myself having to pause and rewind to catch a lot of the names.The whole Reagan theme really seemed over-played to me.  The political aspects of hardcore definitely come through as important.  Yet it seems to be so much more than that.  I believe that hardcore would have rebelled against whoever was in power.One thing I have not seen mentioned was the very light treatment of hardcore music within neo-nazi and other extremist groups.  It is mentioned, but a true historical context would have included the other side of the coin regarding how people of color and other groups were treated and perceived by many hardcore fans.The Special FeaturesIf I had to rate the documentary alone, it might have been a lower rating.  Going through the special features turned out to be the treasure trove I had been looking for.  These special features add 3 stars on their own, and if I could I would have given this 10 stars.Of course there is a standard writer and director commentary feature that lets aspiring film students and other history junkies get some background on the movie.There are also 6 included recordings of historic live performances, including:1. MDC - ""Corporate Deathburger""2. Bad Brains - ""Big Takeover""3. SSD - ""Boiling Point""4. Void - ""My Rules""5. YDI - ""Enemy For Life""6. Jerry's Kids - ""I Don't Belong""Several other more recent performances were included from premier parties for American Hardcore, one from DOA and one from Circle Jerks.And there is also a very nice feature about the photography of Ed Colver which is used in the movie.  The fact that these pictures were taken with a low end camera and lenses is even more amazing and totally consistent with the scene and the way this music was made.Even the included previews were awesome, many of them about movies I've already seen and several about other music related features that I'm definitely going to see now.  Sony Pictures Classics has been doing really great work bringing specialty music movies to the market.The real gems in these features are the deleted scenes.  This footage alone could have been used to make another movie, and most of it was good enough that it could have been included in the movie.  There is over 1 HOUR of this stuff!  Truly amazing, and thank you to the filmmakers for including this here. All movie companies should take note and start doing this.  These extra clips have tremendous historical value for anybody who needs to research this topic in the future.ConclusionWould it have been nice to have an entire history of all of punk rock including all of the better known bands?  Yes, but that's not what this is.  After watching this I was left with a much greater respect for Sony Pictures Classics for making this at all.  It is very difficult to invest the time and money to acquire, produce, market and distribute a movie like this.Those who were not hardcore fans perhaps may have more to learn from watching this.  Not all hard-core fans will be pleased with the documentary, but all should appreciate this DVD version much more if they watch all the extras that are included.If you love learning about music you have a lot to gain from watching this.Enjoy!",5,American Hardcore - The Special Features Make This Product,1209254400,"04 27, 2008",2008,5355,"['American', 'Hardcoreis', 'not', 'definitive',

1039831,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B000LPR6FQ,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","With each generation there is a core group that feels disenfranchised from the rest, rebels without a clue dead set on believing in a different world where only they are the normal ones. They prefer not to be part of the standard norm, instead creating their own images, words and music to symbolize what it is that is unique about them selves. In the 50s there was the greaser, in the 60s there was the hippie and in the 80s there was the hardcore punk rocker. The most amazing thing is that each of these groups has turned out to end up the same way, becoming the norm and finding respect in a world that they rebelled against. AMERICAN HARDCORE takes a look at this last group.Subtitles ""The History Of American Punk Rock 1980-1985"", the film documents the early days, the rise and the eventual fall of the icons of this musical movement. Perhaps some might not consider it musical at all seeing as how it relies little on melody and depends more on sheer volume and power. But when historians look back on the music scene, this one will take its place among the movements that while never quite becoming hugely popular, did indeed influence many acts that followed.Through interviews with those who were on the scene when it began, with those who played in some of the biggest bands of the time, the movie begins its journey in the California punk rock scene where groups of early teens in the 14-15 age group, tired of what they consider oppressive parents and government agencies, revolt with a new music that they adapt for themselves. While the 70s let loose bands like The Ramones and the Sex Pistols, the American hardcore scene took these ideas and broke them down into a rougher, edgier sound.Bypassing melody, the early American hardcore music relied on three chords played loudly and as fast as possible with a guttural vocal that was more grunting and yelling than singing. Played in storefronts and abandoned buildings, the music found its niche with these youngsters in search of a voice of their own.The interviews throughout this documentary show those founding fathers of that movement today as they discuss what was happening when they began and how they were affected by one another. It covers the scene from location to location, noting how what started in one area was adapted in another part of the country and while the same, took on its own versions. The L.A. scene was not like the D.C. scene and neither was quite like what was found in the Boston area.The film focuses on what became the legends of that time with bands like Bad Brains, SSD, YDS, DOA, Minor Threat, The Circle Jerks and perhaps the most famous (thanks in part to the charisma of lead singer Henry Rollins) Black Flag. Members of each group talk about not only what was going on where they were at but what it was that brought them where they were, how they felt at that time and how it altered their lifestyles.In the end, to me, the most amazing thing was to see the change and to hear them discuss how they ended up. Some left bands and went on to become seriously wealthy with investments, some became authors and speakers, and others continue to play today. But just like those in the past, the controversial hip shakers of the 50s, the protestors of the 60s, this generation of rebels became the mainstream as well. They became the fathers and businessmen that their fathers were. Perhaps not selling shoes or working at an ad agency, but in their own way they became the exact thing they were rebelling against so long ago.One thing of interest I found was the influences that these bands had on current acts. While not cited or discussed in the film, bands like Metallica and the Red Hot Chili Peppers come to mind as well as several other bands. Would these bands have become as popular as they are without the early hardcore punk music? Who knows? It's a topic not discussed in the film that could have yielded more conversations than what we have formed here. Then again, perhaps that's not what director Paul Rachman was looking for.The movie is a fascinating study of youth gone wild finding them selves in an artistic way. If you're not a fan of this type of music, this film will not convert you into going out to find the CDs of bands heard. The music, as I said, is fast, loud and more along the lines of Johnny Weissmuller than Frank Sinatra. It has its place, but not all will include it. If you want to find out where much of today's music was based though (and no I don't mean the pop tart of the month music but the more heavy styles), then this movie will give you an insight that perhaps might not have been known.

1039832,ADTUS88NFTW23,B000LPR6FQ,"Melkor ""dark lord""","[2, 3]","If you saw the IFC documentary that came out not too long ago called ""Punk: Attitude"", ""American Hardcore"" picks up where that one left off.  By around1980, traditional punk had pretty much died off, and the Hardcore movement was just starting up. ""American Hardcore"" focuses on all the bands that formed in different regions around the US as a reaction to (among other things) the incoming Reagan administration, the resurgence of bloated 70's dinosaur rock, and the emerging 80's mindless cocaine party scene.The movie covers in a somewhat chronological fashion the rise and fall of the hardcore movement.  From the dirty beach cities of Los Angeles, to the downtown suburbs of Washington D.C., up to Boston, and germinating everywhere in between.  Since Hardcore was a regional phenomenon, the movie covers the scene from a regional point of view, addressing how each city would have it's own group of outsider kids who did not want to be part of the popular culture, and who would do anything they could to actively reject it.  This manifested itself in many forms ranging from the incredible Pettibone flyers advertising SST shows, the creation of regional labels and fanzines, to the D.C. and Boston ""straight edge"" movements.  The filmmakers interview members of bands important to the scene including Black Flag, Bad Brains, Circle Jerks, SSD Control, DOA, Minutemen, MDC, DRI, Minor Threat, Teen Idles, and so on.Though a very thorough film, there are a few glaring omissions.  On the director's commentary track, the filmmakers say that they wanted to include Dead Kennedys and the Misfits in the interviews, but due to intense legal turmoil within both bands during the filming, neither were able to be included in the movie.  I understand this, yet at the same time I feel both of these bands deserved to have at least a minor segment due to their seminal influence on the hardcore scene.  Also, many of the Midwest bands, most notably H&uuml;sker D&uuml;, get only a passing mention in this documentary.My only other problem with this movie is that, just as in ""Punk: Attitude"" where members of bands from the first wave of punk rock say that punk died in 1981; ""American Hardcore"" ends with the aging hardcore guys saying ""Punk is dead"" or ""Punk died in 1986"".  As a person who was just coming of age in 1986 and discovering the third wave of punk beginning with the resurgence of bands like Social Distortion and Bad Religion, the aging hardcore people come across just like their predecessors: as bitter old men.In spite of the few drawbacks, this is an incredible film for both musical and social history.  If you want to expose yourself to well rounded punk history, then I highly recommend watching ""Punk: Attitude"" (~pre-punk-1981), ""American Hardcore"" (~1981-1986), and ""Punk's Not Dead"" (~1986-present).  Additionally, do not miss the incredible documentaries ""The End of the Century"" (The Ramones), ""The Filth and the Fury"" (The Sex Pistols), ""Westway to the World"" (The Clash), ""We Jam Econo"" (The Minutemen), and ""The Future is Unwritten"" (Joe Strummer). [NOTE: as of the time I am writing this review, ""Punk's Not Dead"" and ""The Future is Unwritten"" are still in theaters.

1039834,AKYNIMNI8LOBP,B000LPR6FQ,"Mr. Richard K. Weems ""emperor_weems""","[19, 29]","This documentary cames across to me as being VERY disingenuous and full of faulty reminiscence--basically, a reminder that eye witness accounts, especially in retrospect, should be taken with more than a grain of salt.This film is a documentary of sorts about the early hardcore punk scene--post-Sex Pistols and post-Ramones, after the initial flux of punk rock.  America faced a new threat (the Reagan era), and a whole new crew of young kids had reason to feel ousted from the dream world of the institutions of the country.And so began a nationwide network of bands who pressed their own records, drew their own album covers and played in laundromats and abandoned gas stations.  Bands who slept on the floors of apartments of other bands and knew that their time was short, because their music was all about energy and rage and throwing your fist at whatever face was nearby.  And they called themselves hardcore.  In the course of this documentary are interviews with members of Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Black Flag, The Circle Jerks, SSD, Jerry's Kids, and all kinds of punk rockers who lived and thrashed in those days.But just like the conservative fantasy of the 'good ol' days,' when, as Reagan himself put it so appropriately, ""before there were racial problems in America,"" we know that reminiscence can lie, and even those who lived and worked in the days that are being reminisced upon can often get them wrong.  There are moments of wonderful honesty in this film about the unreserved anger and energy of the early-80s hardcore scene, both its glories and its horrors, and then there are people who just want to feel important and self-righteous, and unfortunately this film cannot distinguish between the two.There are some moments to admire--H.R. of Bad Brains is, as always, a joy to hear, mainly because of the spirituality he infuses into music.  He discusses not so much the glory of the scene itself but he and the band's philosophy behind their actions.  Rollins and Ginn of Black Flag remain steadfastly honest about their scene and their roles in it.  Rollins especially carries the distinction of a man who knows who he is and who he has been, able to look at the drive towards violence in the scene, and report on the abuses he took from police, but also able to look back and know that it was a momentary scene, good for what it could do but also knowing that the violence could only go so far, as Ginn acknowledges as his reason for getting out.But there is a lot that this film very much white-washes or simply ignores.  The minority (and sometimes hatred) of women, which is dealt with in an obligatory couple of minutes, kind of like watching a black man tap-dance on the white-as-hell ""Lawrence Welk Show,"" insisting that there were women in the scene, but the few provided stills conflicting with the primarily testosterone-packed live footage.But my main issue has to do with the overtones of White Power that eventually took over the hardcore scene and had its roots in the early 80s, while in this movie those overtones dismissed by Ian MacKaye insisting that there is ""no racism"" about the Minor Threat song, ""Guilty of Being White.""  The 80s hardcore scene used White Power and Nazi references in two different ways: on one hand, you had songs like ""The Big Takeover"" by Bad Brains that used Nazi references to make political statements, to liken the conservative noose of Reagan clones to the Final Solution.But on the other hand, you had those who simply used the hardcore scene as a way to establish White Power and turn every good idea upside-down.  And this is where the movie fails in a big way, because while I wouldn't say that Minor Threat engendered the White Power movement, there were many who made it its bastardized first step.The problem may lie in the lack of rather distinguished names from the hardcore scene.  Though H&uuml;sker D&uuml; is mentioned a couple of times, no one from the band is ever interviewed.  The same with Dead Kennedys, who clearly saw such a problem in the scene when they wrote a song like ""Nazi Punks F*** Off.""  But in the end, swastikas and KKK hoods and stormtrooper S's are carted across the screen with little sense of who was using them in what way.  It is also curious that the film wants to drop in the Beastie Boys, but never gains any access for comments--did the Beastie Boys simply have no interest in providing any reflection on the hardcore scene, or did they offer comments that didn't fit into the narrow view the filmmakers wanted to expound?  In this respect, I feel that the filmmakers wanted to portray a very predetermined vision of the hardcore years and didn't want anything to get in the way of that.The film is also disingenuous in the way is documents the fall of the hardcore scene.  Yes, there were many bands who dropped their tempos and lamed out into 'hard rock' or metal.  But to present Bad Brains as a band that lost their edge when they started doing reggae?  Even the classic yellow ROIR cassette (which I bought at least 4 or 5 times because people kept stealing mine, since I was the only person in my town who was insane enough to buy that stuff) that they offered as a seminal hardcore album had not only reggae but a dub groove, so to try to say that Bad Brains went the way of the lame by doing reggae after being such great hardcore punks is simply false.In the end, this film comes across as a bunch of older punks harking back on the good old days.  While some can still tell us stories of what really happened, others come across no better than fat and slow varsity letter football players who want to hold on to the myths of their past so deparately that they'll change the facts to make their stories sound plausible.  Dave Brockie puts it best in this movie when he scorns modern punk and follows that up by saying that he just might be ""old and bitter.""  Unfortunately, these filmmakers seem to think that the old and bitter have something honest to say.",2,the fallacy of reminiscence,1172016000,"02 21, 2007",2007,5986,"['documentary', 'cames', 'being',

For those who are unfamiliar to the sub-genre that achieved it's maximum popularity during the 80's, American Hardcore is a documentary worth seeing.  Covering many, but not all, of the influential bands that arose in the early to mid-80's, American Hardcore features old performance footage and interviews with Henry Rollins and Greg Ginn of the legendary Black Flag, Minor Threat mastermind Ian MacKaye, and members of other acts including the Bad Brains, Corrosion of Conformity (yes, they were considered hardcore at one time), and the Circle Jerks to boot.  While American Hardcore is definitely worth seeing for hardcore music fans, there are some glaring omissions that will make hardcore enthusiasts scratch their heads.  The highly influential Dead Kennedys and the Misfits are completely ignored, which isn't just a shame, it's a crime.  Not to mention that there are brief discussions of the Suicidal Tendencies and Husker Du; but neither gets the detail they deserve.  There are some nice extras included on the DVD though, which is a welcome surprise at least.  All in all, American Hardcore does a serviceable and interesting job spotlighting an often dismissed brand of music, but it's hardly as comprehensive as one could hope.",3,"Interesting, but overlooks too many influential acts of the era",1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,1397,"['Hardcore', 'music', 'true', 'hardcore', 'music', 'often', 'confused', 'pointless', 'screaming', 'thrashing', 'little', 'know', 'message', 'method', 'who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'sub-genre', 'achieved', 'maximum', 'popularity', '80', 'American', 'Hardcore', 'documentary', 'worth', 'seeing', 'Covering', 'many', 'not', 'influential', 'bands', 'arose', 'early', 'mid-80', 'American', 'Hardcore', 'features', 'old', 'performance', 'footage', 'interviews', 'Henry', 'Rollins', 'Greg', 'Ginn', 'legendary', 'Black', 'Flag', 'Minor', 'Threat', 'mastermind', 'Ian', 'MacKaye', 'members', 'other', 'acts', 'including', 'Bad', 'Brains', 'Corrosion', 'Conformity', 'yes', 'were', 'considered', 'hardcore', 'one', 'time', 'Circle', 'Jerks', 'boot', 'American', 'Hardcore', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'hardcore', 'music', 'fans', 'are', 'glaring', 'omissions', 'will', 'make', 'hardcore', 'enthusiasts', 'scratch', 'heads', 'highly', 'influential', 'Dead', 'Kennedys', 'Misfits', 'are', 'completely', 'ignored', ""n't"", 'just', 'shame', 'crime', 'Not', 'mention', 'are', 'brief', 'discussions', 'Suicidal', 'Tendencies', 'Husker', 'Du', 'detail', 'deserve', 'are', 'nice', 'extras', 'included', 'DVD', 'welcome', 'surprise', 'least', 'American', 'Hardcore', 'serviceable', 'interesting', 'job', 'spotlighting', 'often', 'dismissed', 'brand', 'music', 'hardly', 'as', 'comprehensive', 'one', 'could', 'hope']",American Hardcore

1039838,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000LPR6FQ,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 6]","American Hardcore (Paul Rachman, 2006)Ever since I heard Steven Blush was adapting his book for the screen, I held my breath in the hopes that someone, somewhere, would get the brilliant idea to try and get the members of Husker Du together in a room somewhere, and then film the resulting chaos. Unfortunately, this did not occur (and the members of Bad Brains, Cro-Mags, and other bands with fabled acrimony involved with their break-ups are interviewed separately), but American Hardcore is still a pretty fun movie if you were there. And maybe even if you weren't, though some younger music fans are likely to take offense at the (dead accurate) assertions of some of the interviewees here that we haven't seen a real punk band since about the last Tuesday of never.And, honestly, that's the problem. Not with the movie, or the book upon which it is based; they're great. Rachman (Four Dogs Playing Poker) combines present-day interviews with archive footage of performances and takes the Errol Morris approach (stay out of the picture and let the subjects ramble on as they please). It's a great trip down memory lane for those of us who were there. But those who weren't? Why will they care? Short answer: except for that rare kid (and I'd assume they get rarer with each passing year) who stumbles upon a Dead Kennedys or Black Flag tape for the first time and is transported the way we were... they won't.Music, it seems to me, is the most difficult of documentary subjects to make a film about which anyone not involved with the genre is going to care. Be honest: if you're not a jazz fan, did you watch Ken Burns' epic? Did anyone who wasn't a metalhead or a TV preacher watch The Decline and Fall of Western Civilization, Part II? Of course not. I think American Hardcore will have a similarly vertical audience, though if you're a youngster who's always wondered what's missing from the current crop of ""punk"" bands, you'll find your answer here as well. Just be prepared, the people interviewed here are just as elitist and annoying about the subject as I am. *** ",3,"Dr. Nostalgia, please pick up the white courtesy phone.",1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,2077,"['American', 'Hardcore', 'Paul', 'Rachman', '2006', 'Ever', 'heard', 'Steven', 'Blush', 'was', 'adapting', 'book', 'screen', 'held', 'breath', 'hopes', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'would', 'get', 'brilliant', 'idea', 'try', 'get', 'members', 'Husker', 'Du', 'together', 'room', 'somewhere', 'then', 'film', 'resulting', 'chaos', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'members', 'Bad', 'Brains', 'Cro-Mags', 'other', 'bands', 'fabled', 'acrimony', 'involved', 'break-ups', 'are', 'interviewed', 'separately', 'American', 'Hardcore', 'still', 'pretty', 'fun', 'movie', 'were', 'there', 'maybe', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'younger', 'music', 'fans', 'are', 'likely', 'take', 'offense', 'dead', 'accurate', 'assertions', 'interviewees', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'real', 'punk', 'band', 'last', 'Tuesday', 'never.And', 'honestly', 'problem', 'Not', 'movie', 'book', 'based', ""'re"", 'great', 'Rachman', 'Four', 'Dogs', 'Playing', 'Poker', 'present-day', 'interviews', 'archive', 'footage', 'performances', 'Errol', 'Morris', 'approach', 'stay', 'picture', 'let', 'subjects', 'ramble', 'please', 'great', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'who', 'were', ""n't"", 'Why', 'will', 'care', 'Short', 'answer', 'rare', 'kid', ""'d"", 'assume', 'get', 'rarer', 'passing', 'year', 'who', 'Dead', 'Kennedys', 'Black', 'Flag', 'tape', 'first', 'time', 'transported', 'way', 'were', ""won't.Music"", 'most', 'difficult', 'documentary', 'subjects', 'make', 'film', 'anyone', 'not', 'involved', 'genre', 'going', 'care', 'Be', 'honest', ""'re"", 'not', 'jazz', 'fan', 'did', 'watch', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'epic', 'Did', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'metalhead', 'TV', 'preacher', 'watch', 'Decline', 'Fall', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'Part', 'II', 'course', 'not', 'think', 'American', 'Hardcore', 'will', 'have', 'similarly', 'vertical', 'audience', ""'re"", 'youngster', 'who', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'missing', 'current', 'crop', 'punk', 'bands', ""'ll"", 'find', 'answer', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Just', 'be', 'prepared', 'people', 'interviewed', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'elitist', 'annoying', 'subject', 'am', '***']",American Hardcore
