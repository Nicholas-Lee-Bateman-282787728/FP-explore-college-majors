However, judging from the films he did after this show...they were mostly tough characters, he may not have had much range in performance. I could be wrong.

Moodie,"[0, 0]","Great stories and certainly brings back good memories, only have one gripe about this is the DVD's are not all that good a quality even though it tells at the start the quality may be impaired. They are watchable though, I thought they might have been of the quality like the perry mason series. I am hoping some more episodes come out because I certainly will buy them.

1540323,A1SDPA1J98UP4L,B00801TAO8,"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF ""Wolf""","[1, 1]","In the third season of Doct Ben Casy the music got a bit louder, omni-present and daring.  A few episodes were very heavy on the musical score to the point where it actually interferred with the story telling.  In Volume 3 it appears the writers and musical people were pushing the envelop trying new things and as always some worked and others bombed.  In general the video and sound quality is much better in this Third Volume.Ths stories in this third series were a bit more complex and the endings were not always the text book sappy everyone lives happily ever after fare that was 50's TV standard.  Trust me by 2014 standards Ben Casey is as far from edgey or cutting edge as I am from normal.  However for the time Ben Casey's third season pushed the 50's ultra conservative envelope a bit.  People \ Patients did not die so much in this third volume compared to how they dropped like flies in the first volume.  the shortened the opening credits and got on with the action much sooner in this Third volume.There are no perks like old commercials hawking things like Bril-Cream, Wild Root, Duz and Oxidol.  The funny thing is watching doctors offer patients cigarettes. The other thing funny about watching ladies and dudes say and do stuff that would have the politically correct police gasping for breath and clutching their pearls.  I love watching Ben Casey Volume 3 for many reasons these shared were only a few of them.  I am sure you will find your own reasons to love Ben Casey Volume 3 if you watch.",5,BEN CASEY WAS A BORN SCAPPER!  DR. BEN CALLED THEM AS HE SAW THEM LET CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY!
