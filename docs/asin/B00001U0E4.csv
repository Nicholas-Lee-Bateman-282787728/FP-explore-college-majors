511881,A2F5OMNCGD430M,B00001U0E4,"Diane ""dmt277""","[12, 13]","This movie is definitely crazy, but it is also quite funny.  Watching this story is like going on some kind of wild ride-like a roller coaster-the plot takes off and never looks back as it goes forward through all of its crazy twists and turns.  The relationship between Vince and Ramon is definitely the most compelling story of all the many subplots, and it is nice to have their story all by itself in the special features section.Most of the characters are really funny: especially the very fat guy-who causes a lot of problems for Kevin-who owns the house that the fat guy is renting a room in.  Another character is Wendy, who is pregnant by her bisexual boyfriend-Tom-who marries Tom's male lover-Kevin.  Wendy and Kevin do this because she does not want to be a single mother and Kevin's mother is putting pressure on him to get married and have children, which he obviously is not all that keen on doing given the fact that he is gay.  (Does anyone want to guess as to how this marriage does?)  The last main character is Andy who is a bisexual stripper-or something like that.  Kevin, Vince, Wendy, Andy, and the Fat Guy all live together in Kevin's house.  Kevin has to have all these roommates so that he can pay the mortgage on the house his mom helped him buy.If you can't tell by now, this is a pretty complicated movie with many subplots, but it is very funny and I enjoyed watching it.  Vince is by far the best character in this movie because he is the only one with any real depth--although with so many characters and subplots it is hard to give much depth to any one character.",4,This is one crazy movie,986860800,"04 10, 2001",2001,1598,"['movie', 'definitely', 'crazy', 'also', 'quite', 'funny', 'Watching', 'story', 'going', 'kind', 'wild', 'ride-like', 'roller', 'coaster-the', 'plot', 'never', 'back', 'forward', 'crazy', 'twists', 'turns', 'relationship', 'Vince', 'Ramon', 'definitely', 'most', 'compelling', 'story', 'many', 'subplots', 'nice', 'have', 'story', 'special', 'features', 'section.Most', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'funny', 'especially', 'very', 'fat', 'guy-who', 'lot', 'problems', 'Kevin-who', 'house', 'fat', 'guy', 'renting', 'room', 'character', 'Wendy', 'who', 'pregnant', 'bisexual', 'boyfriend-Tom-who', 'marries', 'Tom', 'male', 'lover-Kevin', 'Wendy', 'Kevin', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'single', 'mother', 'Kevin', 'mother', 'putting', 'pressure', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'children', 'obviously', 'not', 'keen', 'doing', 'given', 'fact', 'gay', 'Does', 'anyone', 'want', 'guess', 'how', 'marriage', 'last', 'main', 'character', 'Andy', 'who', 'bisexual', 'stripper-or', 'something', 'Kevin', 'Vince', 'Wendy', 'Andy', 'Fat', 'Guy', 'live', 'together', 'Kevin', 'house', 'Kevin', 'have', 'roommates', 'so', 'can', 'pay', 'mortgage', 'house', 'mom', 'helped', 'buy.If', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'now', 'pretty', 'complicated', 'movie', 'many', 'subplots', 'very', 'funny', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Vince', 'far', 'best', 'character', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'real', 'depth', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'subplots', 'hard', 'give', 'much', 'depth', 'one', 'character']",No Ordinary Love

Center,"[6, 9]","There's a wonderful little Scottish movie called Shallow Grave floating around (on DVD even, and it's quite fascinating); this movie is Shallow Grave gone bad.  The plot's very much the same, but the acting here -- if  you can call it acting -- is infinitely worse, and too many of the  characters are not very interesting and simply unlikable.  There's also  nothing memorable about the filmmaking itself -- it's very inconsistent, a  hodgepodge of styles that never come together in a true directorial vision.  In fact, sometimes it seems all director/screenwriter Witkins is  interested in are his actors pretty bodies.",1,Bad Copy of Shallow Grave,959731200,"05 31, 2000",2000,622,"['wonderful', 'little', 'Scottish', 'movie', 'called', 'Shallow', 'Grave', 'floating', 'around', 'DVD', 'even', 'quite', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'Shallow', 'Grave', 'gone', 'bad', 'plot', 'very', 'much', 'same', 'acting', 'here', 'can', 'call', 'acting', 'infinitely', 'worse', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'simply', 'unlikable', 'also', 'nothing', 'memorable', 'filmmaking', 'very', 'inconsistent', 'hodgepodge', 'styles', 'never', 'come', 'together', 'true', 'directorial', 'vision', 'fact', 'director/screenwriter', 'Witkins', 'interested', 'are', 'actors', 'pretty', 'bodies']",No Ordinary Love

They just don't usually make it to the big, or little, screen. We have a guy who owns a house. He can't  come out because his mother fantasizes that he will get married one day. He  rents rooms to a female in a rock band (with whom he, and just about  everyone else, has an affair; a dead guy; a narcissistic (and justifiably  so) actor who likes it both ways; a cute little Asian boy; and an  over-weight bank teller. The movie must be viewed as a self-contained soap  opera, considering the myriad twists of plot and sub-plot, which involves  the usual betrayal, bank robbery, adultery, and murder. The nicest facet of  the story is the developing romance between Vince (the Asian boy) and his  'straight' hispanic neighbor, Ramon -- who is also the son of an abusive  father (upon whom his mother is cheating with Andy, the narcissistic  actor!). The only two who have any integrity in the film are Ramon and  Vince, and they are amply rewarded at the end. Probably only deserves three  stars, but the people are cute enough to bump it up to four. And it's just  nice to see a film where there is a natural variety of sexual preference.  It's not SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, but it is fun.",4,"Not great, just fun.",947462400,"01 10, 2000",2000,1303,"['Actually', 'many', 'loves', 'types', 'love', 'contained', 'little', 'film', 'are', 'quite', ""'ordinary"", 'happen', 'day', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'make', 'big', 'little', 'screen', 'have', 'guy', 'who', 'house', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'mother', 'will', 'get', 'married', 'one', 'day', 'rooms', 'female', 'rock', 'band', 'whom', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'affair', 'dead', 'guy', 'narcissistic', 'justifiably', 'so', 'actor', 'who', 'ways', 'cute', 'little', 'Asian', 'boy', 'over-weight', 'bank', 'teller', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'viewed', 'self-contained', 'soap', 'opera', 'considering', 'myriad', 'twists', 'plot', 'sub-plot', 'usual', 'betrayal', 'bank', 'robbery', 'adultery', 'murder', 'nicest', 'facet', 'story', 'developing', 'romance', 'Vince', 'Asian', 'boy', ""'straight"", 'hispanic', 'neighbor', 'Ramon', 'who', 'also', 'son', 'abusive', 'father', 'whom', 'mother', 'cheating', 'Andy', 'narcissistic', 'actor', 'only', 'two', 'who', 'have', 'integrity', 'film', 'are', 'Ramon', 'Vince', 'are', 'amply', 'rewarded', 'end', 'Probably', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'people', 'are', 'cute', 'enough', 'bump', 'up', 'four', 'just', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'where', 'natural', 'variety', 'sexual', 'preference', 'not', 'SHAKESPEARE', 'IN', 'LOVE', 'fun']",No Ordinary Love

511885,A3MVM8RWFR3HGI,B00001U0E4,Yngvar Myrvold,"[4, 5]","Closeted landlord Kevin lives with his weirdo tenants, an orphaned teenager, a male stripper and a girl playing in an all-girl rock band. Another tenant has recently fallen to his death in a drunken stupor. None of these people pay the rent.Kevin's mum, who owns the house, threatens Kevin with eviction if he doesn't get some paying tenants who can help her meet the mortgages. Full-figured bank clerk Ben is recruited as the missing tenant, and all seems, well, - well!Then Vince, the teenager, develops a crush on his latino friend Ramon, while Andy, the male stripper, comforts Ramon's slutty mother. Ben, meanwhile, is not what he appears to be, and Kevin marries the female rock singer to please mommy, even though he is still in love with the dead tenant. Kevin is one stupid guy.Then things turn nasty...in a very strange way..Trying to outguess this script is patently impossible. No ordinary love plays like something written by John Waters, directed by Andy Warhol/ Gregg Araki and produced by Aaron Spelling. The totally unsuitable music score leans heavily on Dallas, Melrose place and those icky Chris Columbus comedies. Swirling violins, moody pianos and ""funny"" pizzicato music whenever fat Ben enters the picture.The plot is so scrappy it falls apart early on. A lot of interplay between the characters, sure, but nothing is even vaguely related to anything else. The ""acting"" is brutally bad. The schizofrenic mood never settles. From crime-caper to tender love story via melodrama and mystery back to social critique and satire on family life.No ordinary love has one thing going for it: It's never dull. Terrible, yes, but never dull. I would choose this over any Chris Columbus movie, anytime. And - it's a gay movie, as well. Sort of. I could never figure it out.The reviewer from Houston got it absolutely right. This is crazy, plain and simple. Crazy, crazy, crazy.",2,"Crackpot plotting - horrible acting.
