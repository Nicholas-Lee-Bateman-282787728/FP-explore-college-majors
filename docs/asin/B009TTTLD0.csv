1602395,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009TTTLD0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[15, 16]","I understand that comedy is subjective. Along with music, it is one of the harder categories of entertainment to judge because, oftentimes, it just comes down to a matter of taste. But comedy DVDs have an additional stigma that other DVD choices don't face. They can have less replay value once you've heard the jokes the first time.  For that reason, I tend to be somewhat guarded in my recommendations for comedy concerts and apply two criteria: (1) Was it funny? and (2) Would I choose to watch it again?  In the case of ""Joan Rivers: Don't Start With Me,"" the answer to both of these question is an easy affirmative.  I like Rivers as a comedienne, but I wouldn't call myself a devout follower.  So, I was a bit unprepared by how much I loved this thoroughly offensive and take-no-prisoners set.  Rivers sets out to offend just about everyone and is absolutely merciless!Take my word, this is NOT a family friendly show.  If you are familiar with the comedy stylings of Miss Rivers, this shouldn't come as surprise.  But if you've never seen her do uncensored stand-up, I thought I'd make it perfectly clear that this is not for the faint of heart.  Completely uninhibited, Rivers unleashes a torrent of foul language and crude gestures.  She throws herself with great gusto into a terrific physical performance, it's astounding to see the vigor and energy she is able to maintain throughout.  It's fair to say that much of the routine is primed for maximum shock value.  There is nothing that is politically correct or sensitive about Rivers' worldview and she is an equal opportunity offender.  Seriously, no one remains unscathed in this brutal monologue.  She doesn't straddle the line of good taste, she jumps over it with abandon and with no apologies.While Rivers has plenty of topical humor, she seems to have a special love for mocking celebrities (all of whom she claims as friends, of course) and for revealing the humor in aging.  Let's just say she doesn't age gracefully and some of the funniest physical bits have to do with this subject.  Not everything seems as fresh as it might, however.  When she levels jokes at Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch and Winona Ryder's shoplifting charges near the beginning of the piece, I wondered what decade we were in.  The jokes were still funny, they just weren't particularly timely.  But Rivers is relentless.  If you don't like one bit, another is right around the corner.  The set is fast paced and frenetic and never relents in energy or viciousness.  I can imagine more sensitive viewers finding this absolutely appalling.  But if you know and love Rivers, I think this is an incredibly solid set.  About 4 1/2 stars, I'll round up for the sheer brutality of it all.

1602396,A2T46DZ02BDK58,B009TTTLD0,Michael Shapiro,"[7, 7]","Hello: I just bought this dvd of Joan Rivers:&#34;Don't get me started&#34;. It is very funny. My wife and I first heard this broadcast on HBO,and enjoyed it so much,we decided to purchase it. The dvd is clear and very well recorded.  The problem is that when we heard this on T.V. several months ago Joan Rivers' voice was projected clearly so you could understand her very funny comments,but on this dvd which is sold to the public the audience applause and laughing seem to over power Ms.Rivers. You raise the volume to hear her and then the people laugh so loud that you immediately lower the volume.Then Joan River talks again and you can't hear her so you raise the volume very loud and the audience again laughs and laughs so loud -you lower the volume again and again. I believe that Joan Rivers needed to wear a second microphone when she recorded this tape instead of a microphone in the air  or in the audience. It is to much combined mixing of both the laughing and her constant very funny statements. She is a very very funny women and I think the audio engineers working to produce this dvd should have had seperation in the recording of her on stage.",3,The women is very very funny.The audio combines to much audience sound mixed into Joan Rivers talking on Stage.,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,1165,"['Hello', 'just', 'bought', 'dvd', 'Joan', 'Rivers', '34', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'started', '34', 'very', 'funny', 'wife', 'first', 'heard', 'broadcast', 'HBO', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'decided', 'purchase', 'dvd', 'clear', 'very', 'well', 'recorded', 'problem', 'when', 'heard', 'T.V', 'several', 'months', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'voice', 'was', 'projected', 'clearly', 'so', 'could', 'understand', 'very', 'funny', 'comments', 'dvd', 'sold', 'public', 'audience', 'applause', 'laughing', 'seem', 'over', 'power', 'Ms.Rivers', 'raise', 'volume', 'hear', 'then', 'people', 'so', 'loud', 'immediately', 'lower', 'volume.Then', 'Joan', 'River', 'talks', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'so', 'raise', 'volume', 'very', 'loud', 'audience', 'again', 'so', 'loud', '-you', 'lower', 'volume', 'again', 'again', 'believe', 'Joan', 'Rivers', 'needed', 'wear', 'second', 'microphone', 'when', 'recorded', 'tape', 'instead', 'microphone', 'air', 'audience', 'much', 'combined', 'mixing', 'laughing', 'constant', 'very', 'funny', 'statements', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'women', 'think', 'audio', 'engineers', 'working', 'produce', 'dvd', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'seperation', 'recording', 'stage']",Joan Rivers - Don't Start with Me

1602398,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B009TTTLD0,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[6, 11]","Joan Rivers wrote a new book last year which was funny. Lots of white space and a story to offend nearly everyone. But- if you know what you are getting in for, it can be enjoyable. For years Rivers built her routine around her late husband Edgar. Sure she used four letter words but the point of her humor was actually funny.Now approaching 80 years old, Rivers is going for shock humor. Not even insult humor like Don Rickels is known for. Not only does she consider herself an ""equal opportunity offender"" but, based on this 69 minute performance at a theater in St. Charles, Illinois, -a theater with her name emblazoned all over the walls - she presents herself as so horny that she needs sex all the time.After telling jokes to offend, old people (herself excluded of course), Africans-Americans, Asians and lesbians (she does love gay men and - from the reaction and audience shots - with only men in the first two rows - this is now a prime audience for her) she talks female body parts. Trust me; this is more verabally graphic than a discussion with a gynecologist.When it looks like she cannot go any deeper into trying to offend someone, Rivers stoops as low as possible when she tries to make fun of - what else? - the holocaust. (No not the way Mel Brooks does it. In fact, even this audience reacts in silence when she gets this low.)I like funny comedians - and comediennes - and can certainly take strong language (nearly every phrase from Rivers mouth contains a word beginning with the letter F), though it shouldn't be requisite, but I found little to laugh here.There are already two reviews (giving 5 stars to this DVD) here before me., including fellow Amazon reviewer K. Harris, who I generally agree with. My rating is based on the laughter - or, rather lack of it - that I found watching this and sometimes embarrassment I felt for Rivers, having to stoop as low as she does here. So if you are a true Rivers fan, you'll probably like it, but be aware that the language is graphic and the humor is mean spirited.Note that there are no special features on the DVD.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",2,"Cut out the ""F"" Word and you lose 25% of her act, LOTS of graphic body function jokes.
