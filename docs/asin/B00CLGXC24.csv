Have watched his acting progression from Mackeral Run, I Am Sam, BOF, Personal Taste, City Hunder to FAITH.  While CITY HUNTER remains my absolute favorite Lee Min Ho vehicle, FAITH is a very, VERY CLOSE second.Between the story and the sound track (also purchased), this drama hits all the triggers for me in a good way.  I've watched this drama 3x just this year (2013).  While my husband does not really understand my fascination with K-Drama's much less my 'fan-dom' for Lee Min Ho, he did enjoyed FAITH with me.  His favorite character was the baddy bad guy!  He got the giggles whenever the bad guy had some weird happen to him.  The look on his face was priceless.While the abducted doctor is admittedly older than Choi Young, she is the perfect match for him.  Young-ah had to grow up fast in that time period, so the age difference was a non-issue.  She made him laugh and feel loved.  The pairing was perfect to me.  The action scenes with the music back-drop gave me chill bumps.  I would cheer, fist punch & clap along with the battle.  {Did I mention that I was weird for K-Dramas?}You will not go wrong in adding this to your Korean Drama Collection.",5,"Love the Story Plus Lee Min Ho, can't get any better than that!",1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,1225,"['Avid', 'Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'fan', 'let', 'state', 'fact', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'Have', 'watched', 'acting', 'progression', 'Mackeral', 'Run', 'Am', 'Sam', 'BOF', 'Personal', 'Taste', 'City', 'Hunder', 'FAITH', 'CITY', 'HUNTER', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'vehicle', 'FAITH', 'very', 'VERY', 'CLOSE', 'second.Between', 'story', 'sound', 'track', 'also', 'purchased', 'drama', 'triggers', 'good', 'way', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'drama', '3x', 'just', 'year', '2013', 'husband', 'not', 'really', 'understand', 'fascination', 'K-Drama', 'much', 'less', ""'fan-dom"", 'Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'did', 'enjoyed', 'FAITH', 'favorite', 'character', 'was', 'baddy', 'bad', 'guy', 'got', 'giggles', 'whenever', 'bad', 'guy', 'had', 'weird', 'happen', 'look', 'face', 'was', 'abducted', 'doctor', 'admittedly', 'older', 'Choi', 'Young', 'perfect', 'match', 'Young-ah', 'had', 'grow', 'up', 'fast', 'time', 'period', 'age', 'difference', 'was', 'non-issue', 'made', 'laugh', 'feel', 'loved', 'pairing', 'was', 'perfect', 'action', 'scenes', 'music', 'back-drop', 'gave', 'chill', 'bumps', 'would', 'cheer', 'fist', 'punch', 'clap', 'battle', 'Did', 'mention', 'was', 'weird', 'K-Dramas', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'adding', 'Korean', 'Drama', 'Collection']",The Great Doctor aka Faith (Korean Drama with English Sub)

The director really went into depth with the story.  There was great action and adventure.  I have so many favorite scenes but the one that sends me thrilling is when the character Choi Young played by Lee Min Ho leaps upon the wall and rescues the princess. He is fighting the enemies left and right. He is an excellent swordsman. I guess by the time this scene happens and the music is carrying me through it is riveting!  Lee Min Ho is such an attractive man but he is also a great actor.

Looked even better in this drama than he did in City Hunter. He played the lead role in this drama - Choi Young, a real Korean historical figure. This is a historical-fantasy drama. The story starts out with a new Korean king returning to Korea (Goryeo) from Yuan where he has been held hostage for many years to take up his throne. Choi Young and his men are escorting the royal party. Assassins attack, the queen is dealt a lethal slash on her neck. Choi is sent through the &#34;Heavenly Gate&#34; to retrieve the Great Doctor who is alive and well in Korea 2012. The doctor turns out to be a down-on-her-luck plastic surgeon whose only goal is to make enough money to start her own practice. Here comes Choi, fearless and determined to fulfill his King's orders. He kidnaps Yoo Eun-soo (Kim Hee-seon), the doctor, and hauls her through the portal and back into the past. To her, Choi is a psychopath and Goryeo is only a dream or a modern day drama. I enjoyed this drama. I loved the sword play, the fight scenes. Lee Min-ho played the confident, intelligent warrior very well. I love watching him wield a sword and fight. This drama has everything: love, time-travel, villains, supernatural, battle scenes, violence (awesome)...everything. Why not a 5 then? Some parts were a little overplayed and became tedious.

1648727,AAW58LG72PG7I,B00CLGXC24,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","The time travel film has finally reached Korea with FAITH, THE GREAT DOCTOR. This is a film that combines a host of genres: sci-fi, romance, historical costume drama, and philosophy. A modern day female doctor in Seoul is kidnapped by a 15th century warrior (Min-Ho Lee) to tend the wounds of a critically injured queen. From this brief summation flows numerous plot twists, most of which revolve around a 21st century doctor forced to use primitive technology to save numerous injured people. There is of course romance. The Great Doctor and her kidnapper slowly fall in love, both of whom know or fear that someday somehow she must return to her own time, which her warrior-lover refers to Heaven. Others too know of heaven, including an evil nobleman who wants to visit Heaven before he dies. There is plenty of swordplay and a surprising amount of what can only be termed Tai Chi mind control that comes off very much like magic. This was a magnificent cinematic experience that kept me totally involved for each of the 24 episodes. A similarly themed time travel movie called DR. JIN was released the same year; if you liked THE GREAT DOCTOR, you will probably appreciate DR. JIN as well. Both movies explore the infinity of possibilities when time becomes elastic enough to permit one to potentially change what must otherwise be seen as historical necessity.

Unlike many Korean/Japanese dramas that end up with two or three men jealously fighting over the same girl, and her going back and forth trying to choose, a lot of the drama that happens in this story occurs when bad things happen to two people who are truly, deeply in love with each other. And though there might be a couple of suggestive love interests to try and take her away, in the end, she's just not interested in anyone but him. Another thing I like is that it isn't just the main characters, but the entire story has relationships that are pure of heart, including the one between the king and the queen. A lot of relationships in dramas can come off a little shallow at points, but this one is a lot deeper. In fact, at one point, I thought he started acting more like her husband than her love interest. It's the kind of heart melting story that just makes you go &#34;aw.&#34;",5,A Drama w/ Romantic Depth,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",2014,958,"['watched', 'one', 'recently', 'netflix', 'knew', 'wanted', 'own', 'many', 'Korean/Japanese', 'dramas', 'end', 'up', 'two', 'three', 'men', 'jealously', 'fighting', 'same', 'girl', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'trying', 'choose', 'lot', 'drama', 'story', 'when', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'truly', 'deeply', 'love', 'other', 'might', 'be', 'couple', 'suggestive', 'love', 'interests', 'try', 'take', 'away', 'end', 'just', 'not', 'interested', 'anyone', 'thing', 'like', ""n't"", 'just', 'main', 'characters', 'entire', 'story', 'relationships', 'are', 'pure', 'heart', 'including', 'one', 'king', 'queen', 'lot', 'relationships', 'dramas', 'can', 'come', 'off', 'little', 'shallow', 'points', 'one', 'lot', 'deeper', 'fact', 'one', 'point', 'thought', 'started', 'acting', 'more', 'husband', 'love', 'interest', 'kind', 'heart', 'melting', 'story', 'just', 'go', '34', 'aw.', '34']",The Great Doctor aka Faith (Korean Drama with English Sub)

The story and actors are great, but the fight scenes are premature. Compared to other series that I&#8217;ve watched, like Condor Heroes and Demi-Gods and Semi-Evils, this series needs a lot more work both in visual effects and fighting scenes. I guess that is the director&#8217;s fault, not the actors or crew members. After this, I watched the City Hunter which was great, so I guess Lee Min Ho is a good actor, and surprisingly tall!",3,"Good Acting, but Mediocre Visual FX",1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,551,"['watched', 'full', 'series', '3', 'days', 'am', 'WUXIA', 'fan', 'was', 'first', 'Korean', 'drama', '8217', 've', 'watched', 'story', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'premature', 'Compared', 'other', 'series', '8217', 've', 'watched', 'Condor', 'Heroes', 'Demi-Gods', 'Semi-Evils', 'series', 'lot', 'more', 'work', 'visual', 'effects', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'guess', 'director', '8217', 'fault', 'not', 'actors', 'crew', 'members', 'watched', 'City', 'Hunter', 'was', 'great', 'so', 'guess', 'Lee', 'Min', 'Ho', 'good', 'actor', 'surprisingly', 'tall']",The Great Doctor aka Faith (Korean Drama with English Sub)
