908938,A3TSJ46UGNT3QZ,B0009NZ2SI,K.,"[13, 13]","This gets 5 stars from my 3 year old who loved it.  This was a fun spooky SS movie.  I prefer it to Adventures on Ice Cream Island with the Purple Pie Man villian (though that too is worth owning for us since my daughter loves it also, especially when Honey Pie escapes the bad guy).  Anyway, the spooks in this new movie are fun, and my daughter got many giggles when the gang would discover that the cause of their fears weren't scary at all.  My daughter does get scared easy and doesn't watch many movies, so I admit at one point when the suspense over who lived in the shabby blueberry house was getting to her, I cheated and told her, and she had a big giggle when Blueberry Muffin came out.  The suspense was much like the Beach Party SS movie when there was a dark figure that turned out to be another little girl the gang ended up fast friends with.The songs were spooky fun, but just to let you know, the montages had lots of ghosts and whatnot flying around, but in fun.  This is a 'what goes bump in the night' cute little movie that little fans of the other Strawberry Shortcake movies will love.",5,Good for SS fans,1126224000,"09 9, 2005",2005,1109,"['5', 'stars', '3', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'loved', 'was', 'fun', 'spooky', 'SS', 'movie', 'prefer', 'Adventures', 'Ice', 'Cream', 'Island', 'Purple', 'Pie', 'Man', 'villian', 'too', 'worth', 'owning', 'daughter', 'also', 'especially', 'when', 'Honey', 'Pie', 'bad', 'guy', 'Anyway', 'spooks', 'new', 'movie', 'are', 'fun', 'daughter', 'got', 'many', 'giggles', 'when', 'gang', 'would', 'discover', 'cause', 'fears', 'were', ""n't"", 'scary', 'daughter', 'get', 'scared', 'easy', ""n't"", 'watch', 'many', 'movies', 'admit', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'suspense', 'who', 'lived', 'shabby', 'blueberry', 'house', 'was', 'getting', 'cheated', 'told', 'had', 'big', 'giggle', 'when', 'Blueberry', 'Muffin', 'came', 'out', 'suspense', 'was', 'much', 'Beach', 'Party', 'SS', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'dark', 'figure', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'little', 'girl', 'gang', 'ended', 'up', 'fast', 'friends', 'with.The', 'songs', 'were', 'spooky', 'fun', 'just', 'let', 'know', 'montages', 'had', 'lots', 'ghosts', 'whatnot', 'flying', 'around', 'fun', ""'what"", 'bump', 'night', 'cute', 'little', 'movie', 'little', 'fans', 'other', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake', 'movies', 'will', 'love']",Strawberry Shortcake - Moonlight Mysteries

908942,A1MO79MDHXB9J3,B0009NZ2SI,Syrielle,"[10, 10]","We have watched several SS videos and this is at the top of the list of favorites.  The music is catchy and sung well, like all SS music.  The story is about being afraid of the dark and how imaginations can make things look scary even though they're not. Ginger Snap in particular has a fear of the dark and doesn't want to go on the campout with the others. She was able to work through her fears and have a good time. They parallel that fear with the fear of making new friends and how you need to be brave because it's worth it to meet someone new.  Of course this theme goes over most preschooler's heads but that is usually what all SS videos emphasize: friendship.Kids enjoy the campout atmosphere and the spooky things that appear out of the woods.  The images in the show aren't really scary for young kids, just mysterious enough to draw them in.

908944,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B0009NZ2SI,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","I used to love Strawberry Shortcake as a kid, oh more than two decades ago [yup, she's been around that long!] and when I saw this DVD, I thought of checking it out with my 3.5 year-old daughter. We loved this show - ""Moonlight Mysteries"" deals with two themes, that of overcoming fear [of the dark] and also overcoming prejudice against the unknown and making a new friend.In ""Ginger Snap's No-Light Night of Fright"", Strawberry Shortcake sends out invitations for a camp-out but Ginger Snap tries to avoid it because she's afraid of the dark. Eventually SS and friends help Ginger overcome her fear. In ""The Blueberry Beast"", SS and friends think there's something weird about a spooky-looking old house when it turns out that it's the home of Blueberry Muffin, a new girl.Some parents raised concerns that their child/ren were frightened after watching this DVD. Well, I watched it with my 3.5 year-old and she was fine. I guess kids react differently but of course, I would recommend parents watch this with their child if the child is under 5 [and I would recommend it for the 3 and above age group]. As for the learning factor in this DVD - well, it helps children discuss their fears [my own daughter used to be afraid of the dark until recently] and also about not judging things by their appearance. All in all, I'd recommend this as a Halloween viewing treat for the preschool and above age group.",4,Perfect for Halloween!,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,1407,"['used', 'love', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake', 'kid', 'more', 'two', 'decades', '[', 'yup', 'been', 'long', ']', 'when', 'saw', 'DVD', 'thought', 'checking', '3.5', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'loved', 'show', 'Moonlight', 'Mysteries', 'deals', 'two', 'themes', 'overcoming', 'fear', '[', 'dark', ']', 'also', 'overcoming', 'prejudice', 'unknown', 'making', 'new', 'friend.In', 'Ginger', 'Snap', 'No-Light', 'Night', 'Fright', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake', 'out', 'invitations', 'camp-out', 'Ginger', 'Snap', 'avoid', 'afraid', 'dark', 'Eventually', 'SS', 'friends', 'help', 'Ginger', 'overcome', 'fear', 'Blueberry', 'Beast', 'SS', 'friends', 'think', 'something', 'weird', 'spooky-looking', 'old', 'house', 'when', 'out', 'home', 'Blueberry', 'Muffin', 'new', 'girl.Some', 'parents', 'raised', 'concerns', 'child/ren', 'were', 'frightened', 'watching', 'DVD', 'Well', 'watched', '3.5', 'year-old', 'was', 'fine', 'guess', 'kids', 'react', 'differently', 'course', 'would', 'recommend', 'parents', 'watch', 'child', 'child', '5', '[', 'would', 'recommend', '3', 'above', 'age', 'group', ']', 'learning', 'factor', 'DVD', 'well', 'children', 'discuss', 'fears', 'own', 'daughter', 'used', 'be', 'afraid', 'dark', 'recently', ']', 'also', 'not', 'judging', 'things', 'appearance', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Halloween', 'viewing', 'treat', 'preschool', 'above', 'age', 'group']",Strawberry Shortcake - Moonlight Mysteries
