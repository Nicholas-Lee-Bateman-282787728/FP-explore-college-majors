E as Vin's manager is hilarious in his little act. A little man (not much shorter than me) who has his own set of troubles to take care of, who doesnt have commitment issues but thinks he does - is a great act and despite being the most uncomfortable character manages to somehow intrigue the watcher. Entourage is not a Comedy show, it's not a Drama, it's not reality based tv. It's a guy show with no girls as lead characters. Strange as that may sound, it is still very hip and self content. It's no Seinfeld and there are no observations. The show circles around 4 main characters. Kevin Dillon's character is somehow the Cosmo Kramer of the show and manages to derive most laughs. His awkwardness reminds me of my own. The center character, the Jerry Seinfeld of the show, is Vinnie. I'm sure he doesn't get a lot of credit but the fact that he is always in one mood, is simply superb. That, from what I understand, is a great act. Where do I start about turtle? The George Costanza of the show who couldn't care less. Initially, I thought I'd hate his character cause I hate guys like him. You and I both know how many Turtles we run into everyday life so I didn't know what to expect when I saw him on tv. A lot of reviewers admit to loving turtle. I'm sure they're six feet tall studs who love to hug shorter, rounder men...oops let me not drift away. Entourage owns. There is nothing like Entourage. I must say in the last two years, Television is back. Jeremy Piven is about as good as you hear he is. I love his assistant.Season 3 has a lot of action and you get to notice a slight change in the characters. E is more powerful and vice now, Vince takes a bit of a backseat despite getting all the attention - his character looks like it's shaping up for a major fight with E. Both Turtle and Johnny are trying really hard. Johnny is not having the best time of his life while Turtle is lying low in this season.Ari Gold is all over the place. He is becoming bigger and mightier while trying his level best to be a good father and a bad husband.

1046863,AOLHE547CHOTX,B000MLWQ68,Michael Profit,"[0, 0]","Season 3, Part 1 continues the trend of exceptional writing, great locations, and excellent (yet relevant) guest appearances that 'Entourage' viewers have come to expect in this series.Season 3, Part 1 begins where Season 2 left off.  Since shooting James Cameron's 'Aquaman', Vince has reached a level of stardom reserved for the Pitts, Cruises, and Clooneys in our ""normal"" world.  As promised, the lucrative offers have reappeared for Vince in the wake of Aquaman's success, as has a certain movie about a Columbian drug lord.Like its predecessors, Season 3, Part 1 is filled with witty dialogue, Hollywood in-jokes, memorable moments, fantastic locations, and everything in between.  What sets this particular season apart from the others for me is the character development and progression of the show's major characters.  Entourage is a fantastic show, yet a show dedicated solely to a mega-movie star it is not.  As such, the shows ""other"" characters have time to develop, and they do this no better than in this season.  When Turtle's rapper finally makes it big, when Drama gets cast for a pilot, when Eric gets the opportunity of a lifetime with Sloan and Tori, you feel genuinely happy for them.However, for me the biggest character improvement from season to season is Vince.  Adrian Grenier has become a fantastic actor, a role that he perhaps was born for.  However, Season 1 Vince and Season 3 Vince seem to be two completely different persons; while Season 1 Vince lacked any real depth and came off a bit shallow, Season 3 Vince exists for a much deeper purpose, (he even steals a few scenes along the way), all the while coming off much less dim-witted than he did in Season 1.Jeremy Piven reprises his role as Ari; little needs to be said, other than it is very evident why he won an Emmy for this role.  He has some of the very best scenes and lines in this season of any comedy series (a certain Carmen Electra comment in 'The Release' comes to mind).With its cliffhanger (though, perhaps, this is still not a strong enough term) of an ending, I am thoroughly awaiting Season 3, Part 2's release on DVD tomorrow so that the many questions left unanswered become resolved.Overall, Season 3, Part 1 is fantastic.  For me, I still rate Season 2 above it due to its thorough storyline and the split nature of Season 3, however this does not diminish the qualities that made this season an absolute joy for me to watch each Sunday night.A must have DVD set.",5,"Entourage Season 3, Part 1",1191196800,"10 1, 2007",2007,2473,"['Season', '3', 'Part', '1', 'trend', 'exceptional', 'writing', 'great', 'locations', 'excellent', 'yet', 'relevant', 'guest', 'appearances', ""'Entourage"", 'viewers', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'series.Season', '3', 'Part', '1', 'where', 'Season', '2', 'left', 'off', 'shooting', 'James', 'Cameron', ""'Aquaman"", 'Vince', 'reached', 'level', 'stardom', 'reserved', 'Pitts', 'Cruises', 'Clooneys', 'normal', 'world', 'promised', 'lucrative', 'offers', 'have', 'reappeared', 'Vince', 'wake', 'Aquaman', 'success', 'certain', 'movie', 'Columbian', 'drug', 'predecessors', 'Season', '3', 'Part', '1', 'filled', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'Hollywood', 'in-jokes', 'memorable', 'moments', 'fantastic', 'locations', 'everything', 'What', 'particular', 'season', 'apart', 'others', 'character', 'development', 'progression', 'show', 'major', 'characters', 'Entourage', 'fantastic', 'show', 'show', 'dedicated', 'solely', 'mega-movie', 'star', 'not', 'such', 'shows', 'other', 'characters', 'have', 'time', 'develop', 'do', 'better', 'season', 'When', 'Turtle', 'rapper', 'finally', 'big', 'when', 'Drama', 'cast', 'pilot', 'when', 'Eric', 'opportunity', 'lifetime', 'Sloan', 'Tori', 'feel', 'genuinely', 'happy', 'them.However', 'biggest', 'character', 'improvement', 'season', 'season', 'Vince', 'Adrian', 'Grenier', 'become', 'fantastic', 'actor', 'role', 'perhaps', 'was', 'born', 'However', 'Season', '1', 'Vince', 'Season', '3', 'Vince', 'seem', 'be', 'two', 'completely', 'different', 'persons', 'Season', '1', 'Vince', 'lacked', 'real', 'depth', 'came', 'off', 'bit', 'shallow', 'Season', '3', 'Vince', 'exists', 'much', 'deeper', 'purpose', 'even', 'few', 'scenes', 'way', 'coming', 'off', 'much', 'less', 'dim-witted', 'did', 'Season', '1.Jeremy', 'Piven', 'role', 'Ari', 'little', 'needs', 'be', 'said', 'other', 'very', 'evident', 'why', 'won', 'Emmy', 'role', 'very', 'best', 'scenes', 'lines', 'season', 'comedy', 'series', 'certain', 'Carmen', 'Electra', 'comment', ""'The"", 'Release', 'mind', '.With', 'cliffhanger', 'perhaps', 'still', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'term', 'ending', 'am', 'thoroughly', 'awaiting', 'Season', '3', 'Part', '2', 'release', 'DVD', 'tomorrow', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'left', 'unanswered', 'become', 'resolved.Overall', 'Season', '3', 'Part', '1', 'fantastic', 'still', 'rate', 'Season', '2', 'due', 'thorough', 'storyline', 'split', 'nature', 'Season', '3', 'however', 'not', 'diminish', 'qualities', 'made', 'season', 'absolute', 'joy', 'watch', 'Sunday', 'night.A', 'must', 'have', 'DVD', 'set']",N/A

1046869,A31M2QHES2IMB,B000MLWQ68,"Steven Scott ""LeChuck""","[14, 15]","The third season may very well be my favorite so far.  Not to imply that the other seasons aren't great.  We left off last season with Vince getting ready to shoot Aquaman and now we're back after the movie has wrapped and is ready to premiere.  This season has character development in spades and the cast are given equal screen time to shine (save for Debi Mazur who's pregnant this season).  To go into detail would ruin the experience.Another of my favorite aspects of this show are the amount of locations.  This show shoots all over Hollywood and you get to see a lot of it in this season, from the Aquaman premiere in west LA, to the Warner and Universal lots, to a house party in Encino, this show is always on the move.  We even catch a glimpse of Vince in the Aquaman movie at the Santa Monica pier.  Best of all is when the boys hit Vegas and bump into Seth Green and his entourage.  By far my favorite cameo.  Other notables are James Woods, Paul Haggis and Ed Burns.Overall, a very entertaining show with a continually developing storyline.  It's very funny, with plenty of industry inside jokes, but it's also got some great drama(and I don't mean Johnny, but he's good too.)  Despite it being Part 1, it's got an excellent cliffhanger ending to reel you in for more.  I caught the new episode tonight and it's hard to wait week to week instead of one after another on dvd, the way this show is meant to be watched, like one long movie.  Can't get enough of this show.",5,This series just keeps getting better,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",2007,1482,"['third', 'season', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'favorite', 'so', 'far', 'Not', 'imply', 'other', 'seasons', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'left', 'off', 'last', 'season', 'Vince', 'getting', 'ready', 'shoot', 'Aquaman', 'now', ""'re"", 'back', 'movie', 'wrapped', 'ready', 'premiere', 'season', 'character', 'development', 'spades', 'cast', 'are', 'given', 'equal', 'screen', 'time', 'shine', 'save', 'Debi', 'Mazur', 'who', 'pregnant', 'season', 'go', 'detail', 'would', 'ruin', 'experience.Another', 'favorite', 'aspects', 'show', 'are', 'amount', 'locations', 'show', 'Hollywood', 'get', 'see', 'lot', 'season', 'Aquaman', 'premiere', 'west', 'LA', 'Warner', 'Universal', 'lots', 'house', 'party', 'Encino', 'show', 'always', 'move', 'even', 'catch', 'glimpse', 'Vince', 'Aquaman', 'movie', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'pier', 'Best', 'when', 'boys', 'hit', 'Vegas', 'bump', 'Seth', 'Green', 'entourage', 'far', 'favorite', 'cameo', 'Other', 'notables', 'are', 'James', 'Woods', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Ed', 'Burns.Overall', 'very', 'entertaining', 'show', 'continually', 'developing', 'storyline', 'very', 'funny', 'plenty', 'industry', 'jokes', 'also', 'got', 'great', 'drama', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Johnny', 'good', 'too', 'being', 'Part', '1', 'got', 'excellent', 'cliffhanger', 'ending', 'reel', 'more', 'caught', 'new', 'episode', 'tonight', 'hard', 'wait', 'week', 'week', 'instead', 'one', 'dvd', 'way', 'show', 'meant', 'be', 'watched', 'one', 'long', 'movie', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'show']",N/A
1046870,A5TZXWU8AALIC,B000MLWQ68,The JuRK,"[3, 3]","I got rid of HBO after ""The Sopranos"", a brilliant show that went into a gradual decline after the third season, dwindled out to its controversial finale, so I've been watching each season of ""Entourage"" on DVD.  Which I'm glad I did because I don't think I'd want to wait a week or so for a new episode.Actually, I've watched five seasons in two weeks.  Usually one show right after the other.I've been completely drawn in by the entire production.As much fun as the series is to watch, I can feel a day of reckoning coming for Vincent Chase: so far he's been a pretty boy who's been handed everything...but, hopefully, his character will develop along the lines of many, many Hollywood actors--some merely flash-in-the-pans, some the real deal--who hit the wall and have to really give themselves to what they do.  It seems to me like his older brother, Johnny Drama, was once on that path--and he's blown it over and over again.  Vince will need to do something to either achieve superstar status, crash-and-burn like his brother, or just end up as the ""frivolous"" Chase brother.The laugh-out-loud scenes still belong to Ari Gold with a wonderful assist from Lloyd, his gay Asian secretary.  I hear Jeremy Piven has won several Emmys from this role and he richly deserves them.  His foul-mouthed tirades are as shocking and inappropriate as they are hilarious.This is a show that sounds like it knows exactly what it's talking about.",4,"Boom, Part One",1252281600,"09 7, 2009",2009,1436,"['got', 'rid', 'HBO', 'Sopranos', 'brilliant', 'show', 'went', 'gradual', 'decline', 'third', 'season', 'dwindled', 'out', 'controversial', 'finale', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'season', 'Entourage', 'DVD', 'Which', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'because', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'want', 'wait', 'week', 'so', 'new', 'episode.Actually', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'five', 'seasons', 'two', 'weeks', 'Usually', 'one', 'show', 'right', 'other.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'completely', 'drawn', 'entire', 'production.As', 'much', 'fun', 'series', 'watch', 'can', 'feel', 'day', 'reckoning', 'coming', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'so', 'far', 'been', 'pretty', 'boy', 'who', 'been', 'handed', 'everything', 'hopefully', 'character', 'will', 'develop', 'lines', 'many', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'merely', 'flash-in-the-pans', 'real', 'deal', 'who', 'hit', 'wall', 'have', 'really', 'give', 'what', 'do', 'older', 'brother', 'Johnny', 'Drama', 'was', 'once', 'path', 'blown', 'over', 'again', 'Vince', 'will', 'need', 'do', 'something', 'achieve', 'superstar', 'status', 'crash-and-burn', 'brother', 'just', 'end', 'up', 'frivolous', 'Chase', 'brother.The', 'laugh-out-loud', 'scenes', 'still', 'belong', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'wonderful', 'assist', 'Lloyd', 'gay', 'Asian', 'secretary', 'hear', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'won', 'several', 'Emmys', 'role', 'richly', 'foul-mouthed', 'tirades', 'are', 'shocking', 'inappropriate', 'are', 'hilarious.This', 'show', 'exactly', 'what', 'talking']",N/A

You will love watching Ari and his office drama, while Vince holds all of the chips in the relationship.  The gang has their own problems, but Vince is living large, and Ari is sweating bullets.  It is entertaining and extremely fun.  You will have a blast with this season!My only negative comment is that I hate the fact that they broke season 3 into two parts (basically because it is just annoying).  I will tell you that you should buy both parts of season 3 at once, so that you can enjoy it more fluidly than I did.Have fun!",5,Best Season So Far!

1046872,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000MLWQ68,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[4, 4]","Vince and the gang are back for another round.  ""Aquaman"" is a major hit and sends Vince into the ranks of becoming a bona fide superstar.  But as the Hollywood establishment soon learns much to Ari's chagrin, Vince is more concerned about acting and being an artist than he is in making tons of money and being famous.  Not that he doesn't like fame, because he obviously does as do all the boys in the entourage.  Ari and Eric spend most of their time trying to get Vince his next movie (though Eric gets sidetracked by having a threesome), Drama finds himself landing the lead role in pilot directed by Eddie Burns, and Turtle struggles to strike out on his own as rapper Saigon's manager.  Beside trying to get Vince a job, Ari also has his hands full as he begins a new major talent agency.My favorite episodes in the series include:Episode 1:  ""Aquamom"" & Episode 2: ""One Day in the Valley""--these two episodes basically go together and flow nicely if watched back to back.  ""Aquamom"" revolves around the premier of ""Aquaman"" and ""One Day in the Valley"" has Vince and the gang heading into the Valley on opening day to watch the movie in a local theatre as they wait and see if Vince's film can become the highest grossing opening day movie in history.Episode 8:  ""The Release""--Ari, Eric, and Vince get word that QUEEN'S BOULEVARD is going to get a major national release.  But there's a catch, the studios have colorized the film making the black and white masterpiece into a monster of color that makes Willy Wonka look drab.Episode 10:  ""I Wanna Be Sedated""--Ari tries to get rid of both Eric and old-time legendary producer Bob Ryan (Martin Landau).  Eric & Bob get along well and end up finding Vince's next movie, a biopic about The Ramones.Episode 11:  ""What About Bob?""--Ari, Eric, and Bob go to the studios to pitch The Ramones film for Vince, but Ari wants to leave Bob out of the meetings while he deals with the big boys.Episode 12:  ""Sorry, Ari.""--upset about Ari's handling of The Ramones biopic, the Entourage begins shopping around for possible new agents and have to decide between Ari's friendship and the success of Vince's career.Like the previous seasons of ENTOURAGE, this one is chock full of guest stars including James Cameron, Seth Green, Penny Marshall, Paul Haggis, James Woods, and Martin Landau to name a few.  Martin Landau is an amazing talent and he steals every scene he is in.  Episodes 10 & 11 are watching for his performance alone.Though ENTOURAGE has now become a hit cable series, the show is still essentially a soap opera for guys.  However, in this season, there's a lot more dramatic action that occurs.  For instance, Vince becomes a superstar but struggles to find the balance between fame and remaining true to his artistic sensibilities.  Ari finally begins his own powerful talent agency, but struggles between his responsibilities as Vince's friend and his affection for him as his friend.  Of the three seasons available, Season 3 is the best one out.The DVD includes commentaries on three episodes with executive producer Doug Ellin and stars Kevin Dillon and Jerry Ferrara and the ""Vegas Baby, Vegas!"" featurette about the making of the Vegas episode.",5,The Best of the Series Yet,1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,3211,"['Vince', 'gang', 'are', 'back', 'round', 'Aquaman', 'major', 'hit', 'Vince', 'ranks', 'becoming', 'bona', 'fide', 'superstar', 'Hollywood', 'establishment', 'soon', 'learns', 'much', 'Ari', 'chagrin', 'Vince', 'more', 'concerned', 'acting', 'being', 'artist', 'making', 'tons', 'money', 'being', 'famous', 'Not', ""n't"", 'like', 'fame', 'obviously', 'do', 'boys', 'entourage', 'Ari', 'Eric', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'Vince', 'next', 'movie', 'Eric', 'sidetracked', 'having', 'threesome', 'Drama', 'landing', 'lead', 'role', 'pilot', 'directed', 'Eddie', 'Burns', 'Turtle', 'strike', 'out', 'own', 'rapper', 'Saigon', 'manager', 'Beside', 'trying', 'get', 'Vince', 'job', 'Ari', 'also', 'hands', 'full', 'new', 'major', 'talent', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'series', 'include', 'Episode', '1', 'Aquamom', 'Episode', '2', 'One', 'Day', 'Valley', 'two', 'episodes', 'basically', 'go', 'together', 'flow', 'nicely', 'watched', 'back', 'back', 'Aquamom', 'premier', 'Aquaman', 'One', 'Day', 'Valley', 'Vince', 'gang', 'heading', 'Valley', 'opening', 'day', 'watch', 'movie', 'local', 'theatre', 'wait', 'see', 'Vince', 'film', 'can', 'become', 'highest', 'grossing', 'opening', 'day', 'movie', 'history.Episode', '8', 'Release', 'Ari', 'Eric', 'Vince', 'get', 'word', 'QUEEN', 'BOULEVARD', 'going', 'get', 'major', 'national', 'release', 'catch', 'studios', 'have', 'colorized', 'film', 'making', 'black', 'white', 'masterpiece', 'monster', 'color', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'look', 'drab.Episode', '10', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'Sedated', 'Ari', 'get', 'rid', 'Eric', 'old-time', 'legendary', 'producer', 'Bob', 'Ryan', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Eric', 'Bob', 'get', 'along', 'well', 'end', 'up', 'finding', 'Vince', 'next', 'movie', 'biopic', 'Ramones.Episode', '11', 'What', 'Bob', 'Ari', 'Eric', 'Bob', 'go', 'studios', 'pitch', 'Ramones', 'film', 'Vince', 'Ari', 'leave', 'Bob', 'meetings', 'big', 'boys.Episode', '12', 'Sorry', 'Ari', 'upset', 'Ari', 'handling', 'Ramones', 'biopic', 'Entourage', 'shopping', 'possible', 'new', 'agents', 'have', 'decide', 'Ari', 'friendship', 'success', 'Vince', 'career.Like', 'previous', 'seasons', 'ENTOURAGE', 'one', 'chock', 'full', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Seth', 'Green', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'James', 'Woods', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'name', 'few', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'amazing', 'talent', 'scene', 'Episodes', '10', '11', 'are', 'watching', 'performance', 'alone.Though', 'ENTOURAGE', 'now', 'become', 'hit', 'cable', 'series', 'show', 'still', 'essentially', 'soap', 'opera', 'guys', 'However', 'season', 'lot', 'more', 'dramatic', 'action', 'instance', 'Vince', 'superstar', 'find', 'balance', 'fame', 'remaining', 'true', 'artistic', 'sensibilities', 'Ari', 'finally', 'own', 'powerful', 'talent', 'agency', 'responsibilities', 'Vince', 'friend', 'affection', 'friend', 'three', 'seasons', 'available', 'Season', '3', 'best', 'one', 'out.The', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'three', 'episodes', 'executive', 'producer', 'Doug', 'Ellin', 'stars', 'Kevin', 'Dillon', 'Jerry', 'Ferrara', 'Vegas', 'Baby', 'Vegas', 'featurette', 'making', 'Vegas', 'episode']",N/A
