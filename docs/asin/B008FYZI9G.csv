1552062,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,B008FYZI9G,Char,"[3, 3]","This is the third remake (specifically for TV in 1988) of this fictional drama which is based on what has come to be known as the Scopes Monkey Trial in which the defendant was the now legendary Clarence Darrow and the prosecutor was the now legendary William Jennings Bryan.  The trial took place in 1925 and the accused was a substitute teacher who violated a law in Tennessee against teaching evolution.  That is, the law was against teaching science that would undermine belief in the Judeo-Christian God of the Bible.  The characters in this drama are evidently imaginary creations and are not meant to literally recreate the actual people involved in the Scopes case or their actual lives.  The characters' names and the situations in this drama are creative fiction based on events that actually happened.  I don't know if any of the dialogue is taken from the actual Scopes trial.This is the only version of ""Inherit the Wind"" that I've seen.  The most famous version starred Spencer Tracy as the defendant.  Most of the action takes place in the courtroom, demonstrating the contest between a fundamentalist who supports absolute faith in an absolutely literal interpretation of the Bible and a seeming aetheist [perhaps so--the viewer is kept wondering about his convictions] who says he is defending ""the right to think"" and that an ""idea"" is more important than a cathedral.  Throughout the drama, this defender of the right to teach ""science"" and the accused, a young, very innocent-looking and very likable-seeming young man named Burt, both appear to believe in the teaching of ""science as the Truth.""  Especially Burt is portrayed saying only things that sound like he has abandoned belief in or respect for God's Truth.  It SEEMS that he and his lawyer both believe that science alone is truth and that God and the Bible are at most an unreliable source of any kind of explicit truth.  (The defendant, at one point, does bring out the ""fact,"" [thus seeming to posit the truth of the Bible record], that when the Bible in Genesis first speaks of the existence of a ""day,"" it cannot have meant a literal ""24-hour"" day since the sun that distinguished ""time"" on the earth wasn't even created yet on that first ""day.""  My point is that this is one remark that gives the viewer the idea that this defendant may have some kind of respect for the Bible and may think that there is some kind of Truth in it.  Most of the time he makes remarks that seem to place him solely on the side of scientific truth/fact/science.)There are several private scenes between the fundamentalist and his wife in which they are demonstrated to be sincere Christians, and not terribly reprehensible ones.  But the viewer is also given to understand that this man has political ambitions in which his Christianity figures.  He hopes to be elected as a President who will represent the ordinary people, the Christian fundamentalists of the nation.  In one scene he is shown having a confidential talk with the accused's girlfriend; and then later he cites remarks in the courtroom that this girl has told him in strict confidence about the accused.  So, this character is presented in such a way that viewers will have an ambivalent response to him, while they are constantly trying to take sides in this case, trying to decide whether or not to consider the fundamentalist accuser a villain or a good guy.I found the drama difficult to watch.  I felt a strong, uncomfortable tension throughout, and I know that was what the movie makers intended.The movie makers were obviously creating a chiefly ""good guys"" versus ""bad guys,"" ""good"" versus ""evil,"" and ""black"" versus ""white"" tension throughout the greatest part of the movie (but relief comes briefly, at the end), and, despite the occasional generous concession to the fundamentalist's sincerity and integrity of character, the movie presents a strongly prejudicial statement against the Fundamentalists, conveying a simplistic impression of them as Villains to be rejected by enlightened people (which the viewers would presume themselves to be and thus would reject these rabid, ranting, narrow-minded religionists--perhaps rightly so, to a certain extent). Nevertheless, it is from a sermon/speech by the Fundamentalist (who is actually under an implicit indictment by the movie maker and then by the viewer) that the movie takes it title.  He quotes a Scripture that prophesies, ""He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind.""Throughout the movie and the tension caused by the courtroom exchanges, I kept wondering anxiously why the defendant never clearly enunciated a balanced stance stating that Bible Truth and Scientific Truth (seeming factual proof) could rightly co-exist and both could be considered right and true.  An outright MESSAGE to the viewer in favor of this balanced, accommodative approach does finally occur when the trial is over, not having been deemed appropriate during the trial.  It is the singularly important ""afterthought"" expressed by the character who has been made to seem more attractive to viewers, the patient and easy-going and yet ardent defendant, as he smiles and happily accepts to weigh in the balance of justice two books: the Origin of the Species on the one hand and the Bible on the other hand.The movie is a good example, I feel, of the way in which media can create (""manipulate"") public opinion.  Even the movie makers of this film are aware of this and demonstrate a caricature of the process in the movie.  During the scene of the Fundamentalist's speech/sermon, the audience is depicted as a group-herd eager to be led into extreme attitudes and acts that demonstrate a simple Evil versus Good response.  When the Fundamentalist rants against the ungodliness of the scientists who want to bring down God and the Bible, the audience appears to be aroused as one angry body.  The preacher asks the crowd if murder would be the rightful way to deal with the miscreants, and the crowd shows its eagerness to Kill these despicable, ungodly, demonic offenders against God's Truth!  One woman near the camera, if you look at the scene quickly enough before it passes, can be seen actually seeming to move her mouth as if maybe salivating within.  Then the Fundamentalist turns the audience's accusatory sentiment.  He answers the audience-group-herd ""NO!""  He instructs them they must act with Love, according to the Lord's instructions.  Their anger wilts in response, but grudgingly.  It seems that what they really wanted was Blood!,Punishment!,Vengeance of God!It is to this powerful fundamentalist's credit that he tries to turn the people to loving actions based on obedience to God's will as discoverable in the Bible that is on trial, and there is also a scene in which the Defendant lawyer, who turns out to be a moderate in favor of a balance between Science and Blind Faith in the Bible, makes a forceful statement in favor of the good ""Giant"" that was once part of the Fundamentalist's character.Despite the items that were in support of the Fundamentalist's character and the fact that the movie ultimately presented an implicit message recommending a balanced acceptance honoring both sides of the contention, I think that most viewers would come away from the movie feeling strong prejudicial reaction against and hostility toward the character of the Fundamentalist (and his wan wife who always looked terribly pale, unhappy, and deathly ill, seemingly because she was troubled by something [but what exactly?] regarding her husband).I think that the movie makers deliberately create[d] this hostile, rejective attitude toward the Fundamentalist (and other Hollywood movies have tended to have the same agenda).  It seems to be part of a long campaign in movies and the media that presumes a superior intellectualism should look down upon Fundamentalist ""types"" (usually shown as Southerners and pentecostals) who are  depicted as being incapable of intelligent thought and faith-healing deceivers with ulterior motives of greed, and other unattractive traits.Because of the uncomfortable tension created by the contentious theme throughout, I didn't enjoy watching the movie.  And I don't think I'll watch the more famous Spencer Tracy version for comparison.As to the controversy itself, I appreciate the fact that many intelligent fundamentalist Christians are keenly interested in and able to support with convincing scientific evidence some very interesting arguments and evidences in favor of Creationism.  Many non-believer scientists have begun to support the evidence for creation by Design, although they may not specify the Judeo-Christian God as the designer.I thought all the actors in this movie were very excellent in their roles, and the drama was powerful.  While it's a carefully-crafted, intense drama, I reacted (obviously, as stated above) against the manipulation back and forth of the prejudicial aspects of the issue on trial, feeling the effect would be ultimately to create prejudice against so-called fundamentalist Christians and probably, by association, against Christian believers in general as well.  But, again: The implicit message at the end was clearly conciliatory, was balanced, accepting, and non-prejudicial.(I really liked the character created by Jason Robards.  Glad I saw the movie because I will have the memory of this character.)",4,The actors do a fine job.  A carefully crafted and powerful drama,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,9390,"['third', 'remake', 'specifically', 'TV', '1988', 'fictional', 'drama', 'based', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'Scopes', 'Monkey',
