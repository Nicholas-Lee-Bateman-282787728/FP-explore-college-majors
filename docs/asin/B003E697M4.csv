1337812,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B003E697M4,Haunted Flower,"[6, 7]","The Dive from Clausen's Pier1 Disc Widescreen, released July 13, 2010""The Dive from Clausen's Pier"" is a Lifetime movie from 2005 directed by Harry Winer based on a novel by Anne Packer and starring Michael Trachtenberg. Carrie has been with the same boyfriend, Mike played by Will Estes for eight years and is engaged to marry him, but has been growing apart for some time when he suddenly has a horrible diving accident resulting in him being paralyzed. After trying to be strong, she reaches a breaking point and runs away to New York and its possibilities with a relationship with an older man, Kilroy played by Sean Maher.All Lifetime movies have a formula of a female lead, romantic difficulties, and tough decisions. Carrie is set-up as if she is this caring girlfriend but her impatience with Mike's antics make her come-off as a PMS-ing terror until he becomes a quadriplegic and she forces emotions for him and that's exactly what they are -- forced. Mike has difficulty coping with his situation and says very rude, out-of-place remarks and acts out against the nursing staff in unbelievable ways. Basically it's no wonder she doesn't love him anymore and he has trouble believing she cares.Running away to New York and living la vie boheme pushes her into hopes of a career in the nearly impossible field of fashion design and into the arms of a man twelve years older than her and lacking emotional depth. It seems he is running away from a mysterious tragedy in his life as well that is unspeakable.Michelle Trachtenberg squeezes out tears when necessary and really tries to convince the audience she is mature, but comes off as a poser. The lines feel like lines. She does much better work in the non-verbal moments confronting her old boyfriend and trying to understand the strangeness of her new one.Will Estes seems abrupt to the point of unnatural when he first becomes hospitalized and is difficult to watch. Making situations awkward was definitely his goal, but wow did he ever make it easy for her to leave! Sean Maher brings a bit of charm, but the French cuisine tactic is way over the edge.If the story had another half an hour to iron itself out, maybe these characters would have achieved more growth but the middle of the movie was filled with situational party moments that lacked depth. Sit this melodrama out because while it seems to be going somewhere, the ending is inconclusive and unsatisfactory.Bonus Features: None",2,One woman's life altering guilt follows her around till she returns to where she started,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,2453,"['Dive', 'Clausen', 'Pier1', 'Disc', 'Widescreen', 'released', 'July', '13', '2010', 'Dive', 'Clausen', 'Pier', 'Lifetime', 'movie', '2005', 'directed', 'Harry', 'Winer', 'based', 'novel', 'Anne', 'Packer', 'starring', 'Michael', 'Trachtenberg', 'Carrie', 'been', 'same', 'boyfriend', 'Mike', 'played', 'Will', 'Estes', 'eight', 'years', 'engaged', 'marry', 'been', 'growing', 'apart', 'time', 'when', 'suddenly', 'horrible', 'diving', 'accident', 'resulting', 'being', 'paralyzed', 'trying', 'be', 'strong', 'breaking', 'point', 'away', 'New', 'York', 'possibilities', 'relationship', 'older', 'man', 'Kilroy', 'played', 'Sean', 'Maher.All', 'Lifetime', 'movies', 'have', 'formula', 'female', 'lead', 'romantic', 'difficulties', 'tough', 'decisions', 'Carrie', 'set-up', 'caring', 'girlfriend', 'impatience', 'Mike', 'antics', 'make', 'come-off', 'PMS-ing', 'terror', 'quadriplegic', 'emotions', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'forced', 'Mike', 'difficulty', 'coping', 'situation', 'very', 'rude', 'out-of-place', 'remarks', 'out', 'nursing', 'staff', 'unbelievable', 'ways', 'Basically', 'wonder', ""n't"", 'love', 'anymore', 'trouble', 'believing', 'cares.Running', 'away', 'New', 'York', 'living', 'la', 'vie', 'boheme', 'hopes', 'career', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'field', 'fashion', 'design', 'arms', 'man', 'twelve', 'years', 'older', 'lacking', 'emotional', 'depth', 'running', 'away', 'mysterious', 'tragedy', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'unspeakable.Michelle', 'Trachtenberg', 'out', 'tears', 'when', 'necessary', 'really', 'tries', 'convince', 'audience', 'mature', 'off', 'poser', 'lines', 'feel', 'lines', 'much', 'better', 'work', 'non-verbal', 'moments', 'confronting', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'trying', 'understand', 'strangeness', 'new', 'one.Will', 'abrupt', 'point', 'unnatural', 'when', 'first', 'hospitalized', 'difficult', 'watch', 'Making', 'situations', 'awkward', 'was', 'definitely', 'goal', 'wow', 'did', 'ever', 'make', 'easy', 'leave', 'Sean', 'Maher', 'bit', 'charm', 'French', 'cuisine', 'tactic', 'way', 'edge.If', 'story', 'had', 'hour', 'iron', 'out', 'maybe', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'achieved', 'more', 'growth', 'middle', 'movie', 'was', 'filled', 'situational', 'party', 'moments', 'lacked', 'depth', 'Sit', 'melodrama', 'out', 'be', 'going', 'somewhere', 'ending', 'inconclusive', 'unsatisfactory.Bonus', 'Features', 'None']",The Dive from Clausen's Pier

She already had guilt over slowly losing love for her fiance when he then had a life changing accident.  The guilt overwhelms her and she runs away.  She immediately hooked up with someone she had just met and started a sexual affair with him. Personally, I don't understand that.  She eventually goes home and then decided to stay.  Because of guilt.  What?  I felt sorry for the new man - she just used him.  This story wasn't really resolved because of an ambiguous ending.

One moment of not thinking changed all of their lives forever. It was pretty much predictable. I was not impressed with this movie. It was sad yet in many cases true. Think before you act seems to have not been done in this movie at all. I did not like this movie.,1,The Dive,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,390,"['Dive', 'Clausen', 'Pier', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Most', 'was', 'young', 'kids', 'responsibility', 'were', 'self', 'One', 'moment', 'not', 'thinking', 'changed', 'lives', 'forever', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'predictable', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'movie', 'was', 'sad', 'yet', 'many', 'cases', 'true', 'Think', 'act', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'done', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'movie']",The Dive from Clausen's Pier
