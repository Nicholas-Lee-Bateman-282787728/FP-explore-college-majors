1577175,AJVFPC26GHXGF,B008WCP2A6,"Amanda Felix ""angelbuff""","[3, 4]","This one is a cross between The Road and Book of Eli, sort of...In a post apocolyptic world where people are the only source of food left, we follow a group of survivors that have been whittled down over the last several months by starvation, weather and cannibals. It is never explained why or what caused the state of the world as it is now, only that it had occured several years ago. With one member deathly ill, they chance upon an old farmhouse they hope is respite from the weather and roaming groups of cannibals. While in the basement three of the men trigger a Klaxxon alerting the trappers. When they come for them two of the women in the group fight to free them. The fight is brief and it is brutal with niether side showing mercy.During the fight they learn one of their own had actually been what they were running from. Their anger frustration and fear causes them to retaliate against her believing she led them into the trap. Tied up and interogated she endures their tortureShe tells them she is on their side now and although they don't realize it, their chances of survival has just jumped several notches. It is a literal fight to the finish.This is one group of people that all have a tragic story but not unique since it is happening all over the world. There are plenty of questions and only the ones needed for this plot are answered, the most important one is left up in the air for you to decide or make your own conclusion because in the end it is what it is, a post apocolyptic world in which one story out of many is being played out.

Sadly, the movie did not live up to the trailer. I won't go into the plot since the product description and many reviews include it.What I will go into is my shock to see the big ol' WWE logo at the beginning of the movie. I had no idea WWE studios made or produced the movie but on the bright side, I will say this is the best movie they have put out. The black and white feel and look of the movie did ad to the feel but was extremely reminiscent of the look of the Road. Also like the road, the event creating an apocalyptic world was never explained. Like the the Road, the post apocalyptic world is inhabited by cannibals looking for food..... and like the Road, they set traps for people. I suppose the similarities end there.While the movie has a very strong female character at the center, it becomes comical as she apparently has Navy Seal/Martial Arts training and super human strength. They could have made her a strong female character without leaving the realm of reality but I suppose it's the whole WWE thing where they want a super action packed character. Not sure how much WWE had to do with the movie but I wouldn't be surprised if they influenced making the prime character so talented at fighting. It appears no one else in the film matches her superior strength and fighting ability. This took way heavily from the realistic tone the movie tried to make. The acting was subpar especially from well known actors like Shannyn Sossamon and Dominic Monaghan. The special effects in certain parts were also comical as you could tell that it was horrible CGI when someone was stabbed.In the end it was kind of entertaining. Not an awful movie but not a great one. Great concept and could have been executed well but it suffered a bit.

Lost, starving and exhausted; they seek shelter in a seemingly safe abandoned farmhouse where, while searching for food and resources, they unwittingly set off a trap signaling ruthless predators to begin their deadly attack. With food and ammunition dwindling, the group must make a desperate final stand-which takes place over a 24-hour period--battling for their ultimate survival.To be brutally honest, I picked up this movie by mistake. I bought it thinking it was a zombie movie, considering the plot(Course, it's just as good as Zombies and Cannibals eat the same thing, lol). Who'd have thought that it was a post-apocalyptic movie, much in the same vein as The Road. Course, my mistake turned out to be a pretty worthwhile film. One that I've been recommending to all my friends. Actually, I prefer this movie alot more than The Road, despite their similarities. Why? It has alot more action. Not only that but it seems to have a more moving pace than the other did and I like that in my movies. I despise movies that takes two or three hours to tell(not that The Road was that long but you get the gist). Movies that do take that long to tell, I either finsh them in two or three sittings or pass over them altogether. It has to be really compelling for me to sit all the way through. At any rate, The Day is a riveting film that delivers the goods. Far better than most movies of this type, with a lesser budget and a cast of mostly unknowns(except for Dominic Monaghan from The Lord of the Rings trilogy & Lost, Shawn Ashmore from X-Men 2&3, The Ruins & Frozen and Ashley Bell from The Last Exorcism).

It certainly looks very similar with the wash-ed out color scheme and there are some things about the story that were borrowed from ""The Road"" as well.  The story is about a small band of survivors in a post-apocalyptic landscape looking for a place to stay for a very short while.  Things don't turn out the way the survivors had planned and they end up trapped inside of a small ruin of a house with a large group of enemies intend on killing them.  To make matters worse, one of the main characters may not be as trustworthy as they had thought.  The film is full is gritty violence that gets a bit uncomfortable at times with sheer brutality.  Also, I enjoyed the twist in the film and the fact that the character that I thought least likely to survive turned out to make it out alive in the end.  It gets points for unpredictability.

The plot has several other holes as well, the biggest of which is the cannibal clan's survival strategy: sacrificing 30 or so of their group to capture maybe 3 or 4 people.  Even if they consume their own dead, they have enough fodder to pull that kind of operation maybe one and a half times before the jig is up.  And that doesn't even account for the fact that a small, divided band of untrained klutzes can dispatch nearly their entire force after getting trapped in a location designed by the cannibals.  Seriously, was this the cannibal clan's first rodeo?

1577206,AAU5MAMZRRR80,B008WCP2A6,John Milton,"[11, 14]","At Glasgow Frightfest, I was excited about and had the privilege of seeing The Day, a postapocalyptic horror movie that stars recognisable actors such as Dominic Monaghan (Lord of the Rings, I Sell the Dead), Cory Hardricht and Shannyn Sossamon (One Missed Call, Catacombs) and from the looks of the trailer, it was right up my street.Although the synopsis appears to be standard horror fayre, it is quite deceptive in its simplicity. The Day has at its heart, the choices people will make when faced with extreme situations and the lengths they will go to in order to protect their own interests. Base and higher level emotions are at play here: survival, love, mistrust, redemption and hunger...For me, one of the major thrusts of the film was what motivated the cannibals and their potential prey; they both sought to survive in the face of near-certain annihilation and protect their own interests... but went about this in very different ways.The inevitable assault on the farmhouse, alluded to in the synopsis, put me in mind of John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 and added a greater degree of dread to proceedings as the near anonymous assailants began their attempts to overcome the building's defences.Alongside Monaghan and Sossamon is Shawn Ashmore. Best known for his role as Iceman in the X-Men franchise, Ashmore is carving himself quite the niche as a genre actor (Solstice, The Ruins, Frozen, 2010's Mother's Day) and puts in an almost unrecognisable turn as Adam, bulked up, bearded and a mile away from the fresh-faced Iceman of X-Men.Directed by Douglas Aarniokoski (who has worked on directorial duties on horrors such as: The Faculty, From Dusk Till Dawn, Howling VI)and written by Luke Passmore, The Day is suitably bleak and the setting is reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy's The Road. Some may not be entirely happy with the almost monochrome cinematography but for me, it was in keeping with the tone of the film.The standout performance in The Day comes from Ashley Bell (The Last Exorcism) as Mary, the enigmatic member of the survivors whose background is revealed as the film progresses, along with her reticence at divulging the details of her past. Bell delivers a suitably tough yet vulnerable performance and is convincing in the role, moving seamlessly from woman with a troubled past to kick-ass heroine in seconds.Critically, I had an issue with the CG blood during some of the more brutal scenes but mark what I say, these scenes are indeed brutal. Some have criticised the film's use of torture but to my mind, this only serves to reinforce the lengths people are prepared to go to when in desparate situations.The Day succeeds where many horrors fail and balances admirably a character driven plot with enough violence and brutality to satisfy gorehounds.",5,Compelling post-apocalyptic horror in 'The Day',1355616000,"12 16, 2012",2012,2796,"['Glasgow', 'Frightfest', 'was', 'excited', 'had', 'privilege', 'seeing', 'Day', 'postapocalyptic', 'horror', 'movie', 'recognisable', 'actors', 'such', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Sell', 'Dead', 'Cory', 'Hardricht', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'One', 'Missed', 'Call', 'Catacombs', 'looks', 'trailer', 'was', 'right', 'synopsis', 'be', 'standard', 'horror', 'fayre', 'quite', 'deceptive', 'simplicity', 'Day', 'heart', 'choices', 'people', 'will', 'make', 'when', 'faced', 'extreme', 'situations', 'lengths', 'will', 'go', 'order', 'protect', 'own', 'interests', 'Base', 'higher', 'level', 'emotions', 'are', 'play', 'here', 'survival', 'love', 'mistrust', 'redemption', 'hunger', 'one', 'major', 'thrusts', 'film', 'was', 'what', 'motivated', 'cannibals', 'potential', 'prey', 'sought', 'survive', 'face', 'near-certain', 'annihilation', 'protect', 'own', 'interests', 'went', 'very', 'different', 'ways.The', 'inevitable', 'assault', 'farmhouse', 'alluded', 'synopsis', 'put', 'mind', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Assault', 'Precinct', '13', 'added', 'greater', 'degree', 'dread', 'proceedings', 'near', 'anonymous', 'assailants', 'began', 'attempts', 'overcome', 'building', 'defences.Alongside', 'Monaghan', 'Sossamon', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore', 'Best', 'known', 'role', 'Iceman', 'X-Men', 'franchise', 'Ashmore', 'carving', 'quite', 'niche', 'genre', 'actor', 'Solstice', 'Ruins', 'Frozen', '2010', 'Mother', 'Day', 'almost', 'unrecognisable', 'turn', 'Adam', 'bulked', 'up', 'bearded', 'mile', 'away', 'fresh-faced', 'Iceman', 'X-Men.Directed', 'Douglas', 'Aarniokoski', 'who', 'worked', 'directorial', 'duties', 'horrors', 'such', 'Faculty', 'From', 'Dusk', 'Till', 'Dawn', 'Howling', 'VI', 'written', 'Luke', 'Passmore', 'Day', 'suitably', 'bleak', 'setting', 'reminiscent', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'Road', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'happy', 'almost', 'monochrome', 'cinematography', 'was', 'keeping', 'tone', 'film.The', 'standout', 'performance', 'Day', 'Ashley', 'Bell', 'Last', 'Exorcism', 'Mary', 'enigmatic', 'member', 'survivors', 'background', 'revealed', 'film', 'reticence', 'divulging', 'details', 'past', 'Bell', 'suitably', 'tough', 'yet', 'vulnerable', 'performance', 'convincing', 'role', 'moving', 'seamlessly', 'woman', 'troubled', 'past', 'kick-ass', 'heroine', 'seconds.Critically', 'had', 'issue', 'CG', 'blood', 'more', 'brutal', 'scenes', 'mark', 'what', 'say', 'scenes', 'are', 'indeed', 'brutal', 'have', 'criticised', 'film', 'use', 'torture', 'mind', 'only', 'reinforce', 'lengths', 'people', 'are', 'prepared', 'go', 'when', 'desparate', 'situations.The', 'Day', 'where', 'many', 'horrors', 'fail', 'balances', 'admirably', 'character', 'driven', 'plot', 'enough', 'violence', 'brutality', 'satisfy', 'gorehounds']",N/A

1577209,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B008WCP2A6,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","Believably tough men and women in a desperate situation fight for their lives...and I bought it!  It's a familiar premise presented in a gritty different way that works surprisingly well with actors capable of matching the grave tone.A group of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world have banded together, pooled their resources, and are trying to survive.  We know there were originally twelve of them and now they are down to five.  But what caused the apocalypse and wiped out humanity, killed their seven friends, and whatever it is they're protecting themselves from remains a mystery.Our survivors include Adam (Shawn Ashmore), Rick (Dominic Monaghan), Shannon (Shannyn Sossamon), Mary (Ashley Bell) and Henson (Cory Hardrict).  As you can see, all of these actors have a fair bit of experience when it comes to supernatural and horror themes.Whereas Mary comes off as the tough-as-nails survivalist right away, Shannon is much more compassionate, embracing her sensitive needs for her ""family"" above her own survival.  But when things turn grave, both of these women grow a thick, gritty skin.  They're both tough and I found their actions and strength credible--which isn't common in action or horror movies.  Score one for good casting, direction, writing and solid acting for these two actresses (Ashley Bell and Shannyn Sossamon)!  I hope to see these actresses getting more serious work in the near future!  Of the two, Ashley Bell was most shocking--a breakthrough performance really--and her character had the backstory and motivation to justify her outstanding actions (and the acting behind them).With this strong heroine-emergent threat comes a double-crossing twist.  As we identify their enemies, more enemies emerge from within.  I'm intentionally not revealing what their enemies are because I didn't know when I watched this (and I'm grateful I didn't know).  So I'd advise you not to read other reviews for fear of such revelations.I must say that I am impressed with the action quality in this movie, a movie which I never even heard of until Amazon recommended it.  Really impressed.  There isn't a ton of action, but what you get is heavy-hitting, brutal and not over-sensationalized with Hollywood choreography.  Everyone isn't a ninja or ex-special ops agent.  Their tactics were smart, simple and appropriate to the situation and resources at hand.  They're fighting to survive and I believed they were fighting to survive.  Only in a few brief moments did  I question anyone's combat prowess as a bit too much--but let's just let them have their moments, right?  I'm also happy to forgive some CGI use for blood spurts during the phenomenal action sequence at the finale.The acting wasn't amazing across the board.  But it was often credible, much more credible than you'd expect given the budget.  In its non-mainstream style and breakthrough overall quality (again, minding the low budget) this movie struck me much as did The Shrine (2010), which was also not like much else I had seen and also featured an Ashmore twin (Aaron, in this case).  The black and white medium chosen by the director (who has 20 years of experience as a second unit or assistant director) struck me as risky, but it worked wonders for the pilot of The Walking Dead and it worked well here.  Speaking of which, The Walking Dead season 4 writer Luke Passmore wrote this.These filmmakers took some risks and it paid off in spades!

1577233,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B008WCP2A6,Robert Badgley,"[1, 6]","The Day(released Sept/11)stars Dominic Monaghan(Lord of the Rings) as Rick,Shawn Ashmore as Adam,Cory Hardrict as Henson,Michael Eklund as Father,Ashley Bell as Mary,Shannyn Sossamon as Shannon and others.The Day is a Canadian production,filmed in Ottawa on a low budget.The plot is simple,but the direction and the actors combine to give this film a real edgy feel.Except for the beginning,which has faint splashes of colour,the rest of the film is mostly shot in B&W;,with hints of brown.It not only serves the obvious purpose of cutting costs but gives the film an extra punch.The story is set in an undetermined year,in a post apocalyptic world where major groups of survivors have melded into packs or clans.They hunt and kill lone humans to eat,to survive.The film starts out with the abduction of a man's(Ashmore)daughter and wife,right out of their van while he is inside a home,rummaging for supplies.Fast forward to a group of five survivors walking down a rain swept road in the middle of nowhere;Ashmore now one of them.The group comes upon a seemingly abandoned old farmhouse,checks it out and stays for a time.One of the group is sick(Hardrict),while Ashmore and Monaghan are at loggerheads in Monaghan's decision to stay there overnight.While Bell and Sossaman are out foraging for food in the nearby woods,Bell is suddenly attacked by a member of a  clan.Just in the nick of time she dispatches the man.Suddenly a ringing noise alerts the two and they head back to the farmhouse.While they were gone Ashmore and Monaghan were talking in the basement when Ashmore discovered a cache of supplies.They were joined by Hardrict,and they all started to revel in their discovery.They immediately start lifting the boxes to move them which are,unfortunately,rigged.A steel rod contraption impales Monaghan and he dies.A steel door slams into place,locking them all into the basement,and an alarm rings out.It seems this and many other such scattered houses have been rigged to catch prey by local clan members.In a short time a group of men show up to claim their ""kill"".The men in the basement are armed,so the clansmen just bide their time in extracting them.The two women arrive back at the farmhouse,immediately assess the situation and enter the house.They grapple with about a half dozen assailants and kill them.They get the men out but Bell is knocked over the head.When she comes to,she is tied up.It seems Sossaman overhead some comments with the leader of the group,and she is apparently one of their own.Bell has been a kind of loner and very quiet since she joined them.Ashmore is beside himself and comesthisclose to killing her.Bell for her part claims that she got out of her clan because of the despicable violence she endured day in and day out.Time marches on and so do the clan,who return in greater force to storm the house.While the leader of the clan(Eklund)talks to his subordinates about getting some intel on how many people are in the house,his son sneaks off to do just that.The son gets to a window,behind which stands Sossamon.He stabs her,she is startled and she fires and kills the boy.The clan leader witnesses his sons death and vows revenge.The clan storms the house and it is,as they say,on.It is a pitched battle and when the dust settles Bell has been captured by the clan and Ashmore and Sossaman have left.However Ashmore only gets so far when he says he cannot abandon Bell and he returns to help,as Sossaman flees into the woods.Ashmore manages to kill about three assailants and struggles with the last one.Ashmore gets fatally wounded,but Bell finishes the clansman off.As they sit by a water pump,Ashmore passes away.Meanwhile in the woods Sossaman is being stalked by the only survivor of the clan,the leaders little girl.The girl circles Sossaman like a shark,cutting her little,bit by little bit.Then she moves in for the kill.The film ends as Bell is walking down a lone road and is joined by the little girl.There is a shocking moment and then the film fades out.This film,I must say,kept my interest from the beginning to the end.The film is about 80/20-farmhouse centered to outside action.The film's pace,look,actors body language and grizzled and worn looks,are all contributing factors to this film's feel and mood.The film never strays too far off its path,choosing instead to keep the characters back stories to a minimum.This quickens the pace and tightens the tension.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.The outside packaging says there is a commentary extra,but I saw NO such feature on the disc.All in all a nicely done taut post apocalyptic thriller,that slowly builds the tension and never lets go.It is a simple story told very well.Director Aarniokoski does more with less and adds a boffo shocker at the end to really knock it out of the park.Well done in every corner.Recommended.",4,A nicely done post apocolyptic tome,1355702400,"12 17, 2012",2012,4900,"['Day', 'released', 'Sept/11', 'Dominic', 'Monaghan', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Rick', 'Shawn', 'Ashmore',

""The Day"" takes us into the lives of five survivors of a post apocalyptic world where they not only struggle to survive through the elements and starvation but from becoming food for the many cannibals that have taken over. They are looking for a safe haven, a place they could build, grow food and call home with no threat from clans of cannibals that roam the land. They're chances are slim, futures uncertain.....hope and a little luck is all they have to keep them pushing forward, unfortunately for them, they're luck might of just ran out.The survivors take safe haven from an up coming storm in an old abandoned country home, one of the members is sick the others road weary, tired, hungry. As they explore the house they find a stockpile of canned goods in the basement only to find out its a trap that sets off an alarm to signal a nearby clan of cannibals. As the survivors struggle with what to do one thing is for  sure certain, survive no matter what happens.I love when you get to know a character, get to know a little about what makes them who they are than something bad happens to them, it kind of makes you feel a certain way. They we're definitely not afraid to kill people off, I mean come on it is a post apocalyptic world after all.....some of the CG effects, not all, we're a little too noticeable yet not the worst that I've ever seen (i.e. ""Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead (Unrated)"" and ""Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings (Unrated)"" to name a few). One thing I disliked was how stupid the cannibals we're, the leader played by Michael Eklund also made dumb moves, it was a little annoying to me, his stupidity.I also disliked Shannyn Sossamon's character Shannon, she was a straight out a**hole who made drama with another member of the group a little too much an sometimes at the wrong moments.Overall I enjoyed ""The Day"" for what it was, action and some gore and think it deserves a little better ranking on IMDB.com than 5.4, I rank it third in my favorite post apocalyptic movies list with ""Stake Land"" being my favorite and ""The Book of Eli"" taking second.

It is filmed in black and white with a brief flashback in color. People have resorted to clans and cannibalism for survival. Our traveling group of 5 consists of three men and two women. The three guys have been together since childhood and know their roles. Rick (Dominic Monaghan) is the leader due to his experience in &#34;Lost.&#34; Adam (Shawn Ashmore) is his disagreeing friend. Henson (Cory Hardrict) is the third man and he is ill which slows the group down in their travels.Shannon (Shannyn Sossamon) has been with the group for 12 years and is cold toward Mary (Ashley Bell) a quiet lone wolf who has recently joined the group. Then if you read the back of the DVD it informs you that they set off a trap and must fight for their lives against another group. And that's pretty much the movie except...The film has a slight twist which make it watchable. It doesn't bring anything new to the table and is one of the more boring post-apocalyptic films out there. No zombies. No Thunderdome. No weird vehicles. No colorful cans of Dole Pineapple. In fact they got 41 bullets between them. The film partially builds upon the relationship of the characters, which I found to be hit or miss as it doesn't give you much background so you have to draw something from their mostly robotic movement.

It is about a group of five `friends' who have been reduced from a band of twelve. They are all armed with machetes or guns and are very low on supplies. We are not told what has happened just that people seem to be disappearing to roaming nasty types and we get that in flashback from Michael Eklund's (`Watchmen') character whom we don't get to know his real name just that he is a father and he's lost wife and child.Cory Hardrict (`Battle Los Angeles') who plays Henson is clearly unwell and it is chucking it down, so when they come across an abandoned farmhouse they decide to rest up and get dry and hopefully find some food of the non human type. Despite their misgivings about hanging around too long, they overstay their welcome and they soon find out that they are not alone. What ensues is a fight for survival with quite a lot of blood letting.This is hard to categorise as it does not have any zombies or vampires etc, these seem to be predatory cannibals and that is it, at one point we are reminded that they `are still human'. There are more twists than I don't know what and the acting is all convincing with only a couple of un creditworthy performances. The picture quality is all colour flushed away and looks almost black and white giving it a similar feel to `The Road' which is just trying to emphasise the bleakness and I felt it really worked.There is no bedroom stuff and the gore is on the tame side for horror genres but there is still plenty to keep you hooked; with a run time of 87 minutes it will not outstay its welcome either. I love siege type films and this is one in that genre but with cannibals outside rather than a more down to earth foe.

1577248,A14BPA6BKYORZG,B008WCP2A6,troyriser,"[0, 0]","I first saw the actress Ashley Bell in the horror film, 'The Last Exorcism', and marveled how well the filmmakers used the auteurish, found-footage approach, which has now become trite and overused, a device employed by every film studio graduate out there as a means to cut corners on production costs. I had never heard of her before I saw that film, and was impressed at the way she took what could've been a cookie-cutter possession role modeled after Linda Blair and made it her own. When I saw the (very under-promoted) film, 'The Day' advertised, I almost passed it over until I saw her name in the credits.When I think of this movie, I picture Ashley Bell as Mary, bathing in a stream. Describing it that way makes it sound like some  softly focused softcore porn scene but that isn't what's happening at all. It's the end of the world, with potential threats everywhere, and she's like some furtive forest animal, pausing to listen and scan her surroundings as she washes the grime from her legs and arms and chest. Ashley Bell's Mary hardly speaks throughout the course of the film, with only a comparatively few lines of dialogue, but she moves and acts with that same direct, animalistic purpose: quickly, with no wasted motion, and--when necessary--ferociously. The other actors contribute to this pack vibe for the simple reason they are a pack, human beings on the move, gathered together for the sake of mutual defense and survival. In this post-apocalyptic film, some packs, like Mary's, cling to their humanity and strive to maintain their dignity and sanity in the face of overhelming hopelessness and loss. Others don't, and it's those savage others who represent that which is no longer human, and who pose the greatest threat.I don't mean to diminish the work of the other actors in this film by focusing solely on Ashley Bell's performance. It is truly an ensemble effort. The script is tightly written, with none of the characters doing things that people simply don't do when under enormous stress or in combat--such as the kinds of things characters do in the television series 'The Walking Dead', for example, where they inexplicably decide to hold deep, meaningful conversations regarding the state of their romantic relationships or take off alone out of sight of the group or disobey the orders of the group's leader, and so on. In a real-world hostile environment, those who don't exercise personal discipline or follow orders die very quickly. People scavenging the wasteland for food and hiding from or confronting ruthless savages wouldn't give much thought to things like sex or relationships. Thus, the script for 'The Day' is believable. The characters are well-realized and appropriately motivated.Again (and finally), it's Ashley Bell's performance in this film that made it worthwhile for me. Physically, she isn't classically beautiful--especially in this movie--but I simply couldn't take my eyes off her. Every move she made, every facial expression, every pause or emphasis in dialogue was/is practically perfect.

I mean, it looked decent, sounded like a cool idea and had a pretty good cast, right? Sure, I figured, it might not become a favorite of mine, but it would be at least an okay watch. Yeah, about that...sometimes first impressions are wrong, very wrong.I don't require every little last detail of how things came to be the way they are spelled out for me in such a world, but I'd like a general clue as to what went wrong to bring the whole world down. Don't expect that here. There's NO explanation in the slightest, and I never had any idea on what made the 'different' group adapt their tendencies that set them apart from the regular humans. Virus? Aliens? Rampant mental illness? I couldn't say, as there was never even a hint about how they became different. We're just expected to buy into that because that's the way it is. Not enough for me. Shore up the idea a bit instead of just shoving it out there and hoping it flies. This one couldn't even glide...it just crashed and burned.It was slow to start, then jumped into all kinds of action before I had a chance to really get to know any of the characters beyond an artificial level. I felt largely detached during scenes that should have been edge-of-my-seat tense. Actually, I felt that way throughout 99% of this movie. I couldn't relate to the characters, and I couldn't suspend my disbelief during a story that had potential to be something great. It wasn't. It was a bitter let-down and nothing more. Neither side of the conflict captured my attention. I found myself hoping they'd all kill each other off, down to the last one, so that it would just end. No such luck, of course.The washed out color scheme of the whole movie lent nothing to it. I like this technique for certain scenes or a whole movie in some cases, but not this one. Instead of setting  level of grimness to the world, it made it even more uninteresting. I'm surprised that was possible. The last 30 or so seconds of the movie was about the only part that piqued my interest, and it wasn't even a total surprise. The other 1 hr. and 20 min+? Snooze fest.Lack of character development, no reasonable set-up and an absent plausible story, even in an apocalypse, let me feeling cheated with this one.
