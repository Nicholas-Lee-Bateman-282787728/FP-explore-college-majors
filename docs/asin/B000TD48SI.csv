1089171,AMA6SPA2A43JH,B000TD48SI,Cassie,"[1, 4]","The first four seasons Tony yelled at Jeannie all the time, even when it wasn't her fault. In the last season, except for ""Djinn, Djinn, The Pied Piper"" he didn't yell at her at all. During the first four seasons the trouble she got into was innocent, but during the last season it seems to me she did it on purpose. In ""I'll see you in C.U.B.A."", just before Tony appears in his office and while he was there she had a look on her face that showed she had no remorse for bringing him from his ship. If she had done that during the first four seasons he would have yelled like yelling was going out of style. All he did was beg her to send him back. In the first four seasons he would blame her even if it wasn't her fault or he was involved too. He went from one extreme to the other. 1st-4th Season he was too hard on her, yelling at her too much. 5th Season he didn't yell at her enough. Some people think the show ended because Tony and Jeannie got married, but I think it had a lot to do with Tony becoming henpecked. And No! that's not the same thing. Tony could have yelled at Jeannie even after they were married. On Bewitched Darren spent 8 years yelling at Samantha(And guess what, they were married). That's why the 5th season wasn't my favorite.

A 5th and final season was made, Jeannie got married, NBC got lots of free press, and the series was then cancelled.

1089178,A3E2AB97PKT0Y8,B000TD48SI,Dr J,"[1, 1]","This is the final season of Jeannie.  The hijinx continue and the spark is still there for this season.  And Tony comes to his senses and marries Jeannie. Although Tony and Roger are still the same characters, Jeannie actually continues her metamorphosis. By the third season (as I wrote in a review), Jeannie is no longer a secret character, but becomes a player in many scenes with other characters.  In this season, she's in many more scenes as a major player, and dons her jeannie outfit just to remind us that she is a jeannie (a word of warning--Barbara Eden as a platinum blonde is absolutely gorgeous and seeing her in the attire of the times--mini skirts--could be dangerous for young males).  Jeannie has even bought into Tony's fear of having anyone discover their secret.  At the wedding scene, she seems more afraid of discovery than Tony.Well, this was the final season.  Could it have gone on any longer?  Well, maybe.  The writers probably could have come up with other inane storylines, but now that Tony and Jeannie are married, they certainly would have had children.  Comparisons with Bewitched would have become more acute.  We were given a glimpse of what the show would have developed into in an earlier season when Tony wonders whether their kids would be normal or jeannies.  They're jeannies, of course. It was nothing but Jeannie running around chasing her bratty kids.  Thank goodness we were mercifully spared such nonsense.  No, it was probably a good time for the show to end.One final thought on I Dream of Jeannie.  Is there any value to this show, besides the simple entertainment value?  Well, yes. Maybe it gives the viewer cause to reflect on is own nature. Tony is so unbelievably restrained in what he asks Jeannie to do.  But the few times when Roger controls her, he sets himself up better than the Shah of Iran and he always suggests that he and/or Tony get the pleasures of the world beyond their wildest dreams. The question is ""what would you do--show restraint and wisdom or become a selfish, unbridled hedonist?""",5,Fun show!,1219449600,"08 23, 2008",2008,2059,"['final', 'season', 'Jeannie', 'hijinx', 'continue', 'spark', 'still', 'season', 'Tony', 'senses', 'marries', 'Jeannie', 'Tony', 'Roger', 'are', 'still', 'same', 'characters', 'Jeannie', 'actually', 'metamorphosis', 'third', 'season', 'wrote', 'review', 'Jeannie', 'no', 'longer', 'secret', 'character', 'player', 'many', 'scenes', 'other', 'characters', 'season', 'many', 'more', 'scenes', 'major', 'player', 'jeannie', 'outfit', 'just', 'remind', 'jeannie', 'word', 'warning', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'platinum', 'blonde', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'seeing', 'attire', 'times', 'mini', 'skirts', 'could', 'be', 'dangerous', 'young', 'males', 'Jeannie', 'even', 'bought', 'Tony', 'fear', 'having', 'anyone', 'discover', 'secret', 'wedding', 'scene', 'more', 'afraid', 'discovery', 'Tony.Well', 'was', 'final', 'season', 'Could', 'have', 'gone', 'longer', 'Well', 'maybe', 'writers', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'other', 'inane', 'storylines', 'now', 'Tony', 'Jeannie', 'are', 'married', 'certainly', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'children', 'Comparisons', 'Bewitched', 'would', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'acute', 'were', 'given', 'glimpse', 'what', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'developed', 'earlier', 'season', 'when', 'Tony', 'kids', 'would', 'be', 'normal', 'jeannies', ""'re"", 'jeannies', 'course', 'was', 'nothing', 'Jeannie', 'running', 'around', 'chasing', 'bratty', 'kids', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'were', 'mercifully', 'spared', 'such', 'nonsense', 'No', 'was', 'probably', 'good', 'time', 'show', 'end.One', 'final', 'thought', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'there', 'value', 'show', 'simple', 'entertainment', 'value', 'Well', 'yes', 'Maybe', 'viewer', 'cause', 'reflect', 'own', 'nature', 'Tony', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'restrained', 'what', 'Jeannie', 'do', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'Roger', 'up', 'better', 'Shah', 'Iran', 'always', 'Tony', 'get', 'pleasures', 'world', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'question', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'show', 'restraint', 'wisdom', 'become', 'selfish', 'unbridled', 'hedonist']",N/A

1089191,A2SR8CWDTIKXAT,B000TD48SI,Tell It Like It Is,"[29, 32]","Many people have criticized the last season of Jeannie as being the worst and that marrying Tony and Jeannie ""killed"" the show. It might not have been the best idea to marry them since it was the constant pursuit of Tony by Jeannie that so much of the series was based on. On the other hand, how long could you go on with her pursuing him before that alone would have become worn out? In the end, I don't think tony and Jeannie getting married is why this was the last season. This season does have some good episodes on it. My favorite one being the episode with the designer Mr. Halasko who is hired by the Bellows to redecorate the Nelson residence. There are a few other good episodes but one thing that is sad is the lack of episodes with Jeannie's sister. This season only has one episode with the sister and its not my favorite one, either. In the end, I don't think there was a ""bad"" season of this show, but maybe the 5th season is my least favorite because it was the end. No matter what, if you collect the series, you must have this season, too.One thing I like in this season is the way they do Barbara Eden's hair. It's gorgeous! And so are many of her fabulous outfits. This season would have been 1969 - 1970.

Then it became huge in syndication in the '70's, '80's and '90's and thanks to DVD it will live on in posterity.By 1970 the network and producers wanted the series to be rattled up a bit so they married Jeannie and Tony (much to the dismay of Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman). The ratings dropped further as that spark between the two leads was gone and the scripts became lane and repetitve.

1089193,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000TD48SI,trebe,"[0, 0]","Looking create some fresh new situations, and perhaps bolster ratings, the fifth season of I Dream of Jeannie (1969-70) features the marriage of USAF Major Anthony Nelson (Larry Hagman) and Jeannie (Barbara Eden), the genie he freed from her bottle.  Having explored a lot of territory over the years, the series had become something of a free for all fantasy.  While the stories are still whacky, marriage does bring things in the Nelson home, more in line with normal everyday life, and the shapely Jeannie is seen a lot less in her trademark harem costume.The series' terrific cast, and the wonderful chemistry they have together, continue to be a major strength that often helps to overcome lesser quality material.  Nelson and Major Roger Healey (Bill Daily) remain a solid comedic team.  Once a constant threat, Dr. Bellows (Hayden Rourke) had evolved into something of a dupe, which actually adds to the humor.  The expanding role of the gifted Emmaline Henry as Amanda Bellows, is also a key factor.  Amanda was also something of a threat at the beginning, but is now firmly on the side of Jeannie and Tony.  For many years, Barton Maclane had been fantastic as General Peterson, but unfortunately he passed away in 1969.  As a replacement, Vinton Hayworth assumed the role of General Schaeffer, but shortly thereafter in 1970, Hayworth also passed away.Leading up to the Nelson wedding, some of the high points include ""Jeannie's Beauty Cream"", where Jeannie's gift of facial cream, changes Amanda's appearance to that of another woman (Laraine Stephens).  Tony celebrates his last days as a single man in ""Jeannie and the Bachelor Party"", as the partygoers attempt to evade Amanda Bellows.In"" Jeannie and the Matchmaker"", with Tony now married, Roger feels left out, so Jeannie finds him a girl, at the same time Tony is trying to fix him up with a General's daughter.  Bonnie Crenshaw (Damian Bodie), Tony's old high school love, comes to visit in ""Eternally Yours, Jeannie"", trying and help her husband (Denny Miller) obtain a government contract, but things get complicated when a jealous Jeannie impersonates Bonnie.Barbara Eden makes her final appearance as Jeannie's scheming sister, in ""My Sister, the Home Wrecker"" which also features Eden's then husband Michael Ansara.  The uniform hating dog Djinn Djinn, also makes a return appearance.  There are really no big name guest stars, but future Charlie's Angel Farah Fawcett (1947-2009) appears in two episodes.Closing out its final season, I Dream of Jeannie remains a fun program that in the end, essentially becomes much like Bewitched, the show that ""Jeannie"" creator Sidney Sheldon, was originally supposed to try and emulate.  With the new domestic situation, the series could have gone on for while longer, but with less than stellar ratings, the series was cancelled.  Image quality of the 26 episodes is generally good, although disappointingly there are no commentaries, or extras, and the episodes continue to lack English subtitles.Post ""Jeannie"", Barbara Eden would work mostly on TV movies, finding success inHarper Valley P.T.A.(1978), which later became a TV series.  Eden would also return for several Jeannie TV movies.  Larry Hagman would rise to superstardom in Dallas (1978-91), while Bill Daily would become part of another classic comedy, playing Howard Borden on The Bob Newhart Show (1972-78).  Sidney Sheldon (1917-2007) continued in television with hits like Hart To Hart (1979-84), and also became one of the most bestselling authors in history, producing novels likeBloodline(1977),Rage of Angels(1980),The Sands of Time(1988),Master of the Game(1982), andWindmills of the Gods(1987).",4,"Jeannie and Tony find marital bliss, as this zany classic series completes its run...",1345420800,"08 20, 2012",2012,3680,"['Looking', 'create', 'fresh', 'new', 'situations', 'perhaps', 'bolster', 'ratings', 'fifth', 'season', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', '1969-70', 'marriage', 'USAF', 'Major', 'Anthony', 'Nelson', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'Jeannie', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'genie', 'freed', 'bottle', 'Having', 'explored', 'lot', 'territory', 'years', 'series', 'had', 'become', 'something', 'free', 'fantasy', 'stories', 'are', 'still', 'whacky', 'marriage', 'bring', 'things', 'Nelson', 'home', 'more', 'line', 'normal', 'everyday', 'life', 'shapely', 'Jeannie', 'seen', 'lot', 'less', 'trademark', 'harem', 'costume.The', 'series', 'terrific', 'cast', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'have', 'together', 'continue', 'be', 'major', 'strength', 'often', 'overcome', 'lesser', 'quality', 'material', 'Nelson', 'Major', 'Roger', 'Healey', 'Bill', 'Daily', 'remain', 'solid', 'comedic', 'team', 'Once', 'constant', 'threat', 'Dr.', 'Bellows', 'Hayden', 'Rourke', 'had', 'evolved', 'something', 'dupe', 'actually', 'humor', 'expanding', 'role', 'gifted', 'Emmaline', 'Henry', 'Amanda', 'Bellows', 'also', 'key', 'factor', 'Amanda', 'was', 'also', 'something', 'threat', 'beginning', 'now', 'firmly', 'side', 'Jeannie', 'Tony', 'many', 'years', 'Barton', 'Maclane', 'had', 'been', 'fantastic', 'General', 'Peterson', 'unfortunately', 'passed', 'away', '1969', 'replacement', 'Vinton', 'Hayworth', 'assumed', 'role', 'General', 'Schaeffer', 'shortly', 'thereafter', '1970', 'Hayworth', 'also', 'passed', 'away.Leading', 'up', 'Nelson', 'wedding', 'high', 'points', 'include', 'Jeannie', 'Beauty', 'Cream', 'where', 'Jeannie', 'gift', 'facial', 'cream', 'Amanda', 'appearance', 'woman', 'Laraine', 'Stephens', 'Tony', 'last', 'days', 'single', 'man', 'Jeannie', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'partygoers', 'attempt', 'evade', 'Amanda', 'Bellows.In', 'Jeannie', 'Matchmaker', 'Tony', 'now', 'Roger', 'left', 'out', 'so', 'Jeannie', 'girl', 'same', 'time', 'Tony', 'trying', 'fix', 'up', 'General', 'daughter', 'Bonnie', 'Crenshaw', 'Damian', 'Bodie', 'Tony', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'love', 'visit', 'Eternally', 'Yours', 'Jeannie', 'trying', 'help', 'husband', 'Denny', 'Miller', 'obtain', 'government', 'contract', 'things', 'get', 'complicated', 'when', 'jealous', 'Jeannie', 'Bonnie.Barbara', 'Eden', 'final', 'appearance', 'Jeannie', 'scheming', 'sister', 'Sister', 'Home', 'Wrecker', 'also', 'Eden', 'then', 'husband', 'Michael', 'Ansara', 'uniform', 'hating', 'dog', 'Djinn', 'Djinn', 'also', 'return', 'appearance', 'are', 'really', 'big', 'name', 'guest', 'stars', 'future', 'Charlie', 'Angel', 'Farah', 'Fawcett', '1947-2009', 'two', 'episodes.Closing', 'out', 'final', 'season', 'Dream', 'Jeannie', 'fun', 'program', 'end', 'essentially', 'becomes', 'much', 'Bewitched', 'show', 'Jeannie', 'creator', 'Sidney', 'Sheldon', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'try', 'emulate', 'new', 'domestic', 'situation', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'longer', 'less', 'stellar', 'ratings', 'series', 'was', 'cancelled', 'Image', 'quality', '26', 'episodes', 'generally', 'good', 'disappointingly', 'are', 'commentaries', 'extras', 'episodes', 'continue', 'lack', 'English', 'subtitles.Post', 'Jeannie', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'would', 'work', 'mostly', 'TV', 'movies', 'finding', 'success', 'inHarper', 'Valley', 'P.T.A', '1978', 'later', 'became', 'TV', 'series', 'Eden', 'would', 'also', 'return', 'several', 'Jeannie', 'TV', 'movies', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'would', 'rise', 'superstardom', 'Dallas', '1978-91', 'Bill', 'Daily', 'would', 'become', 'part', 'classic', 'comedy', 'playing', 'Howard', 'Borden', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', '1972-78', 'Sidney', 'Sheldon', '1917-2007', 'continued', 'television', 'hits', 'Hart', 'Hart', '1979-84', 'also', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'bestselling', 'authors', 'history', 'producing', 'novels', 'likeBloodline', '1977', 'Rage', 'Angels', '1980', 'Sands', 'Time', '1988', 'Master', 'Game', '1982', 'andWindmills', 'Gods', '1987']",N/A
