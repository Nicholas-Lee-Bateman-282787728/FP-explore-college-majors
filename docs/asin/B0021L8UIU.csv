I then had to watch it to see if it was any good, to sort of see if I missed out on anything by not requesting it. Bart Got a Room is a feel-good comedy about the trial and tribulations that one boy must face to secure a date for the prom. It touches on the insecurities and mostly sends a positive message about family and growing up. William H.

The movie follows the main character, Danny, as he approaches his Senior Prom.  He's got everything ready: the tux, the limo, the dinner reservations and hotel room booked.Danny's parents are divorced and give him well-meaning but inept advice.  William Macy plays the ultimate goofball dad who will go to any means to help Danny out while on his own search for love in the world of internet dating.  Danny's parents provide some real laugh-out-loud moments in the film.  In the meantime, Danny is freaking out because the last thing he wants to do is go to prom with his best female friend, Camille.  Her family puts some serious pressure on him but he claims to only have eyes for Alice, his sophomore carpool partner who is also a popular cheerleader.  When that falls through, Danny begins a desperate search for a date which ultimately leads him back to Camille only to find that she has her own date now.The movie had some really embarrassing moments and so many recognizable characters- from Danny's own messed up family to his circle of friends, there's a little something for everyone in this movie.There is a plethora of sexual innuendo and very  suggestive scenes.  There is some crude humor and language so if that bothers you or you find it offensive, this movie won't be for you.The ending of the movie is really what makes it worthwhile.  I don't know if I agree fully with Danny's take-away that maybe 'you're supposed to find something a little comfortable and boring' but I think it is definitely a good lesson to make the best of what and who you've got in your life.",4,Bart Got a Room,1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,1665,"['Wow', 'movie', 'was', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'times-', 'good', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'Danny', 'Senior', 'Prom', 'got', 'everything', 'ready', 'tux', 'limo', 'dinner', 'reservations', 'hotel', 'room', 'booked.Danny', 'parents', 'are', 'divorced', 'give', 'well-meaning', 'inept', 'advice', 'William', 'Macy', 'ultimate', 'goofball', 'dad', 'who', 'will', 'go', 'means', 'help', 'Danny', 'out', 'own', 'search', 'love', 'world', 'internet', 'dating', 'Danny', 'parents', 'provide', 'real', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'film', 'meantime', 'Danny', 'freaking', 'out', 'last', 'thing', 'do', 'go', 'prom', 'best', 'female', 'friend', 'Camille', 'family', 'serious', 'pressure', 'only', 'have', 'eyes', 'Alice', 'sophomore', 'carpool', 'partner', 'who', 'also', 'popular', 'cheerleader', 'When', 'Danny', 'desperate', 'search', 'date', 'ultimately', 'back', 'Camille', 'only', 'find', 'own', 'date', 'now.The', 'movie', 'had', 'really', 'embarrassing', 'moments', 'so', 'many', 'recognizable', 'characters-', 'Danny', 'own', 'messed', 'up', 'family', 'circle', 'friends', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', 'movie.There', 'plethora', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'very', 'suggestive', 'scenes', 'crude', 'humor', 'language', 'so', 'find', 'offensive', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'you.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'really', 'what', 'worthwhile', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'agree', 'fully', 'Danny', 'take-away', 'maybe', ""'you"", ""'re"", 'supposed', 'find', 'something', 'little', 'comfortable', 'boring', 'think', 'definitely', 'good', 'lesson', 'make', 'best', 'what', 'who', ""'ve"", 'got', 'life']",Bart Got a Room

Well... this is basically 90 minutes or so of just such pain. Bart, the rather helpless and mostly passive hero of our movie, takes care of the most important details of his prom date - such as getting the tickets and a hotel room, but he forgets to find a date. Or, actually, he doesn't forget - if he only opened his eyes wide enough he would find one but instead he focuses his sights on the more unattainable targets. Actually, one of these targets is so cluelessly evil that you want to smack her. Or him, so you don't have to feel so embarrassed. Although in that case he'd likely feel even more embarrassed.The only nice thing about this movie was the presence of William H. Macy, who played the father of Bart.

The bar has been set by not-seen-`til-the-end Bart, the class nerd, with the booking of hotel rooms, limousines, etc. Cute and studious Camille (played by Alia Shawkat fromArrested Development, a comedy I adore) has been friends with Danny for a long time and the easy thing for them to do would be to attend prom together, but that doesn't happen of course. I became frustrated with Danny's attempts to get other girls to be his date, but I also related to him - as easy as Camille would be to fall back on, at his age I'd likely want something new (perhaps even sexier) too. This is what teenagers do.William Macy, who plays Danny's father, is one of the few bright spots. Most of the characters are pretty bland, but Macy manages to shine despite the surroundings. I really don't like the haircut he has there, but that's part of the cheap role I guess. His best moments are when he drops everything to help find a date for his son as the prom draws near. He even leaves a sexually-heated date of his own behind! Bart Got A Room is your typical high school movie, but not exactly A-list.

In fact, he is mentioned repeatedly without a face to match the mysterious name practically the whole movie.  Bart is the unlikeliest of people to do... well anything - the uncoolest, the lamest, the dullest.  So when Danny (the main character) falls short at every corner attempting to find the perfect date for the prom, it's his comparison to Bart that propels the story.  With a few months until the prom: Danny wants the perfect date... with a month to go: well a good date... a few days: a date... hours to go: someone with a pulse.It's one of the oldest stories ever put to the silver screen - boy idealizes girl, boy is denied girl, boy realizes what's under his very nose all along, boy attempts to overcome obstacle... errr something like that.

1246574,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0021L8UIU,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","If you have seen the trailer for Bart Got a Room, you have pretty much seen this movie - or at least the first 45 minutes. Virtually every joke in the first 3/4 of the movie is set up and told in the trailer. If you haven't seen the trailer, this movie might just be a lot funnier.Danny is obsessed with going to his Senior prom. Three months before the prom (as the great big silent era panels say whenever time has moved forward), Danny starts to consider who he will invite to the prom. He drives a cute sophomore cheerleader to school everyday, and he wants to ask her. That falls through, she feels like Danny is her brother. The hilarity moves on from there. Potential dates keep falling through, but all the while his best childhood friend, Camille wants to go with him. Nope, Danny has bigger ideas, so that won't work either. The intensity and hilarity of the film builds right up until the big moment of the prom, and does Danny have a date or not?There's a little bit good and a lot bad about this film. William H. Macy is funny as Danny's father. He wears a 70's afro wig, dark socks, and sandals. He tries very hard to help his son to the best of his ability, think middle class white 'Wild and Crazy Guy.' Danny, played by newcomer Steven Kaplan, does a decent job as our hero. Sadly he's tossed the same scene as Judge Reinhold inFast Times at Ridgemont High (Widescreen Special Edition)on the toilet dreaming about Phoebe Cates. Its an awful scene, he's forced to look at cheerleader pictures and thinking of his sophomore cheerleader (in a PG-13 film, its pretty pathetic). Jennifer Tilly makes a cameo towards the end of the film. Camille (Alia Shawkat), Danny's long time friend, is actually a pretty girl that they pretend is dowdy; the pretending just doesn't work very well. Alia does reasonably well with a pitiful script.This is a gratefully short film, just one hour and 20 minutes. There isn't much that should be cut to make the film better. Pacing is actually pretty decent, considering that the jokes are just not exactly very funny. The film is shot in a straightforward manner, nothing surprising or special going on at all. There is a decent tracking shot when Danny runs to the back of Camille's house - a surprisingly complicated shot. Otherwise, its potboiler camera and editing work. Sound was nothing remarkable. The music was much louder than the dialog. There were many post production redubs done, sadly they were obvious.The DVD is a real mess. There is exactly one bonus feature above and beyond the Anchor Bay previews. This bonus feature has to be the worst executed I have ever seen, it is production notes pop ups. Some may remember the VH-1 bubble videos where really stupid funny comments about the song would pop up with a little bubble popping noise. Well they do the same thing here, bubble popping noise, pop up balloons, with interesting production notes. After about 5 of the most inane comments ever tossed on the screen, it was time to stop. The first bubble was: no girls are in the band, Brian [Hecker the director] didn't want any prom prospects. The last one before putting them out of their misery: Notice the Christmas ornaments, they are subtle reminder that this Jewish family isn't very religious. Hilarious....funny...enlightening. Hopefully pop up bubbles are gone forever.The film is rated PG-13. This is a very mature PG-13 film. Simply presented here for somebody deciding if the film is appropriate for their child. There is a fair amount of strong language (one f-bomb), some crude conversation about females, a young girl (under the age of 16 since she can't drive) that takes off her clothes in the car (yes the bra looks like a swimsuit and no panties are really shown, but she does take her clothes off), a prostitute that won't 'do prom,' and a masturbation scene that drags on a bit too long. Another case where I absolutely do not understand the MPAA.There just aren't enough really funny moments in this film. I did laugh a few times. The plot was just implausible enough. Yeah there is a happily ever after ending to the film, and there is a sweet point to the movie. But I had to travel through so much garbage to get to that point, it was no longer sweet. I wish I had left well enough alone by watching the trailer and calling it a day.",2,"Save A Lot Of Time - Just Watch The Trailer, It's Better",1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,4320,"['have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'Bart', 'Got', 'Room', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'seen', 'movie', 'least', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'Virtually', 'joke', 'first', '3/4', 'movie', 'set', 'up', 'told', 'trailer', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'trailer', 'movie', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'lot', 'funnier.Danny', 'obsessed', 'going', 'Senior', 'prom', 'Three', 'months', 'prom', 'great', 'big', 'silent', 'era', 'panels', 'say', 'whenever', 'time', 'moved', 'forward', 'Danny', 'consider', 'who', 'will', 'invite', 'prom', 'cute', 'sophomore', 'cheerleader', 'school', 'everyday', 'ask', 'Danny', 'brother', 'hilarity', 'moves', 'Potential', 'dates', 'keep', 'falling', 'best', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Camille', 'go', 'Nope', 'Danny', 'bigger', 'ideas', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'either', 'intensity', 'hilarity', 'film', 'builds', 'right', 'up', 'big', 'moment', 'prom', 'Danny', 'have', 'date', 'not', 'little', 'bit', 'good', 'lot', 'bad', 'film', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'funny', 'Danny', 'father', '70', 'afro', 'wig', 'dark', 'socks', 'sandals', 'very', 'hard', 'help', 'son', 'best', 'ability', 'think', 'middle', 'class', 'white', ""'Wild"", 'Crazy', 'Guy', 'Danny', 'played', 'newcomer', 'Steven', 'Kaplan', 'decent', 'job', 'hero', 'Sadly', 'tossed', 'same', 'scene', 'Judge', 'Reinhold', 'inFast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'Widescreen', 'Special', 'Edition', 'toilet', 'dreaming', 'Phoebe', 'Cates', 'awful', 'scene', 'forced', 'look', 'cheerleader', 'pictures', 'thinking', 'sophomore', 'cheerleader', 'PG-13', 'film', 'pretty', 'pathetic', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'cameo', 'end', 'film', 'Camille', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'Danny', 'long', 'time', 'friend', 'actually', 'pretty', 'girl', 'pretend', 'dowdy', 'pretending', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'very', 'well', 'Alia', 'reasonably', 'well', 'pitiful', 'script.This', 'gratefully', 'short', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'hour', '20', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'much', 'should', 'be', 'cut', 'make', 'film', 'better', 'Pacing', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'considering', 'jokes', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'exactly', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'shot', 'straightforward', 'manner', 'nothing', 'surprising', 'special', 'going', 'decent', 'tracking', 'shot', 'when', 'Danny', 'back', 'Camille', 'house', 'surprisingly', 'complicated', 'shot', 'Otherwise', 'potboiler', 'camera', 'editing', 'work', 'Sound', 'was', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'music', 'was', 'much', 'louder', 'dialog', 'were', 'many', 'post', 'production', 'redubs', 'done', 'sadly', 'were', 'obvious.The', 'DVD', 'real', 'mess', 'exactly', 'one', 'bonus', 'feature', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'previews', 'bonus', 'feature', 'be', 'worst', 'executed', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'production', 'notes', 'pop', 'ups', 'may', 'remember', 'VH-1', 'bubble', 'videos', 'where', 'really', 'stupid', 'funny', 'comments', 'song', 'would', 'pop', 'up', 'little', 'bubble', 'popping', 'noise', 'Well', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'here', 'bubble', 'popping', 'noise', 'pop', 'up', 'balloons', 'interesting', 'production', 'notes', '5', 'most', 'inane', 'comments', 'ever', 'tossed', 'screen', 'was', 'time', 'stop', 'first', 'bubble', 'was', 'girls', 'are', 'band', 'Brian', '[', 'Hecker', 'director', ']', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'prom', 'prospects', 'last', 'one', 'putting', 'misery', 'Notice', 'Christmas', 'ornaments', 'are', 'subtle', 'reminder', 'Jewish', 'family', ""n't"", 'very', 'religious', 'Hilarious', '.funny', 'enlightening', 'Hopefully', 'pop', 'up', 'bubbles', 'are', 'gone', 'forever.The', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'very', 'mature', 'PG-13', 'film', 'Simply', 'presented', 'here', 'somebody', 'deciding', 'film', 'appropriate', 'child', 'fair', 'amount', 'strong', 'language', 'one', 'f-bomb', 'crude', 'conversation', 'females', 'young', 'girl', 'age', '16', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drive', 'clothes', 'car', 'yes', 'bra', 'looks', 'swimsuit', 'panties', 'are', 'really', 'shown', 'take', 'clothes', 'prostitute', 'wo', ""n't"", ""'do"", 'prom', 'masturbation', 'scene', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'case', 'where', 'absolutely', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'MPAA.There', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'really', 'funny', 'moments', 'film', 'did', 'few', 'times', 'plot', 'was', 'just', 'implausible', 'enough', 'Yeah', 'happily', 'ever', 'ending', 'film', 'sweet', 'point', 'movie', 'had', 'travel', 'so', 'much', 'garbage', 'get', 'point', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'sweet', 'wish', 'had', 'left', 'well', 'enough', 'alone', 'watching', 'trailer', 'calling', 'day']",Bart Got a Room
1246575,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0021L8UIU,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","Having achieved several ""Best of Fest"" awards at a few film festivals, ""BART GOT A ROOM"" is an independent film that is a semi-biographical film of the teenage life of writer and director Brian Hecker.Hecker has described himself as a ""pathetic girlfriendless dweeb in South Florida"" but if there is one thing that Hecker is known for, it's his 1998 thesis fillm ""Family Attraction"" (starring Chris Penn and Martin Sheen) whch is one of AFI's highest grossing short film to date.Having developed scripts for film studios, Hecker returned with a film that showcases his life of trying to find a prom date but using the character Danny Stein (played by Steven Kaplan) as a high school student with raging hormones and just trying to find himself and not be surpassed by the school's uber-nerd, Bart.VIDEO & AUDIO:""BART GOT A ROOM"" is featured in anamorphic widescreen (1:85:1). Overall cinematography was well done and for a DVD, I didn't see a large amount of digital compression artifacts or high noise.The film is presented in Dolby Surround 5.1 and for the most part, the film is a dialogue-driven film that focuses on front channel usage.  There is occasional ambiance through crowd scenes that you will hear through the surrounds.  At times, the music seems to overpower the dialogue at times when volumes are low but for the most part, easily adjusted through your receiver.So, viewers can expect a clean video and audio on DVD.Subtitles are featured in Spanish or English SDH (Subtitles for Death and Hearing Impaired).SPECIAL FEATURES:Aside from the upcoming films on DVD trailers, there is a ""Pop-Up Production Notebook"" which people can re-watch the film and you will see pop-up production notes.I wished there was audio commentary because it would have been great to hear Brian Hecker talk about the differences between his real-life situation versus what we see on film with the character of Danny.  Also, a featurette on how they accomplished William H. Macy's Jewish fro and interviews with the talent would have been awesome.JUDGMENT CALL:""BART GOT A ROOM"" is an interesting teen comedy.  It could have easily went the way of other ""Revenge of the Nerd"" or similar type of films but it didn't and Director Brian Hecker did a good job with showcasing the magnified peer pressure in combination with ranging hormones with the character of Danny.Where in most films in the past, teens would be warned of not getting in trouble or getting laid but to find a film where parents were easily supportive of their son not to become as low as the school nerd was quite interesting.  Even more fun is watching William H. Macy as Ernie Stein with the `fro and trying to talk openly with his son about women or girls and what to do.If anything, this is not just about a teenager trying to find a prom date and losing his virginity, there is actually a story behind this film.  How a family has grown out of its comfort zone since a divorce.  Beth Stein (Hines) has a pudgy boyfriend who likes to stroke her thigh in front of her son and then you have Ernie Stein (Macy) who just talks about sexy all the time but yet, his life has not exactly been all that exciting.  And it helps escalate the uncertainty of Danny (Kaplan) about his chances of finding a date.If anything ""BART GOT A ROOM"" doesn't need to become like any other teen film, nor does it have to incorporate teen sex or promiscuity to have a good story.

Many of the scenes are taken right from the experiences he had in high school.  Many of the scenes are even shot in the places where he had them.  Sounds like it might be interesting, right?  The only problem is that his prom experience was pretty much like most/many guys prom experiences.  This movie has not only been lived before by millions of people, but has also been put on film in dozens of different movies.  It's not that it's done badly.  In fact, Bill Macy and Cheryl Hines do absolutely fantastic jobs as the parents.  Hines disappeared into her character so well that, at times, I was asking myself, ""Is that really Cheryl Hines?""  The wig she wore had something to do with that, but her acting also was unlike any character I've seen her play before.  She did impress me a lot.  Some of the younger actors also turned in good performances - particularly the guy who learned to play the drums for his part and did a great job of it.  Also, the actress who played Marcie.  She's only in the film for about a minute - but what a minute.  So, in summary - not an original or particularly interesting story, but good performances by some of the actors that are worth watching.

It may have been the nerdy coming-of-age narrative or the Jewish family trappings, but for some reason, I kept thinking of Neal Simon's Brighton Beach Memoirs.  And I mean that to be taken in a complimentary light.It's almost time for the Prom, and high school senior Danny has a problem.  His newly divorced parents, engagingly played by William H. Macy and Cheryl Hines, assume he's taking Camille (Alia Shawkat), his platonic best friend of nine years.  But Danny has other plans - he wants to ask Alice, the flirtatious young sophomore he drives to school.  But Danny has been reading the signs of her interest all wrong, thanks to the bad advice of his father, and when Alice turns him down for the prom and walks out of his life, well, his time to procure a date is rapidly running out.Although ostensibly not much more than your standard teen flick, Bart's Got a Room has some surprisingly adult and well-crafted humor, and despite the ending that I predicted shortly into the second scene, there was a lot of feel-good moments and some genuine laughs.  Chief among these was the sub-plot involving Danny's desire to see his parents get back together, more than a few very adult and funny situations, and a hilarious cameo by Jennifer Tilly, who steals the movie as a sex-hungry dinner-date that Danny's father meets on the Internet.  Newcomer Steve Kaplan is engaging as Danny, and the film is uniformly well acted and cast.This certainly was not the worst 80 minutes or so I've spent on a film recently, and in the end, I found I enjoyed this little comedy more than I expected to.  Probably the best thing about it was the fact that it didn't seem to be written to appeal to teens, and was totally devoid of the puerile adolescent humor one expects to find in films of this sort.

In fact, numerous scenes were shot around locales which were familiar to him as a child.  This film is very autobiographical in that Hecker based it on memories of his senior prom as well as the proms of his friends and relatives.  Watching this film made me think of my own prom and I wished it had turned out as wonderful as it did for Danny Stein (Steven Kaplan).""Bart Got a Room"" is a warmhearted, bittersweet drama of a young man, Danny  who must make numerous decisions concerning his upcoming prom.  The most important decision involves who will be his date.  He's torn between taking someone with whom he can become romantically intimate and his best friend Camille (Alia Shawkat).  In the meantime, his parents' divorce weighs heavily on his mind.  Danny is a good kid.  He yearns to see his parents (perky Cheryl Hines and downtrodden William H. Macy both looking silly in wigs) get back together so they can become a real family.  My heart ached for him.  Danny finds his parents' choice for dates nauseating.  I found them hilarious (especially Jennifer Tilly who has a cameo as a freak).  Hines is looking for a man with good financial assets while Macy, who repulses his dates, is looking for a woman with good ""assets"" of a different kind.  Both of them seem lonely without each other.""Bart Got a Room"" is also an inspirational drama that teaches us to be ourselves.  You can't plan for a special moment to happen.  You have to let it happen on its own, and hope that it lasts forever.  So what if the class dweeb got a room at the prom, Danny got a memory that lasted forever.  He realized what was truly important in life.  It had been staring at him in the face all along.The highly talented Stephen Kaplan shines as the adorable Danny.  It is hard to believe that ""Bart Got A Room"" is his first role in a motion picture.  Alia Shawkat is wonderful as Camille.  She starred in another prom movie - ""Prom Wars"" - and the Christmas comedy ""Deck the Halls"" with Danny DeVito and Matthew Broderick.Anchor Bay Entertainment did a wonderful job with the audio, video and widescreen presentation of 1.85:1; English subtitles have also been provided.  Instead of full-length audio commentary, there is a pop-up production notebook.  During the film, handwritten notes of interest suddenly appear in large bubbles.  Many of them are hilarious and interesting but you must be a fast reader because they quickly disappear.

The main character, Danny, is described as a nerd, but he is more complex than that. In fact, he is somewhat of an enigma. A nerd would lack self-confidence, especially with girls, but Danny seems quite comfortable with them. He also seems to be oblivious(even though quite intelligent otherwise) to the fact that it is not only generally a challenge to get a date, but as time goes by, it gets harder and harder to get a date to the prom. The complexity of all the characters adds interest and depth to this addition to the normally dull prom movie genre. It is rated PG-13, but there are some scenes that are rather inappropriate to the taste of many parents. It seems to me that these scenes could have easily been left out.

The pay-off when we finally do meet up with Bart is hilarious. The basic premise is Danny getting a limo, tux and hotel room for the prom to the tune of $600 but there is one thing missing, a date! Everyone is expecting Danny to take his best friend of 8 years Camille(a great Alia Shawkat) but Danny is looking at Prom night as a chance to make it an everlasting memory of sexual conquest which he certainly knows is not going to happen if he takes his best friend. His search for a prom date and eventual revelation is either helped or made more uncertain with his seperated parents help. A hilarious (William H. Macy and Cheryl Hines) bring a bit of class and acting chops to this film that helps lift it up from the ordinary but it never quite makes it next level due to a familiarity with the script and few surprises along the way.

1246590,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B0021L8UIU,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[4, 4]","Danny Stein (Steven Kaplan) is a borderline nerd/average high school senior who's facing a problem that most of us moderate geeks and nerds have faced in high school:  getting a date for the prom.  Initially he plans to ask Alice, the cute and very flirty sophomore he regularly drives home after school.  He goes so far as to turn down his longtime friend, Camille (Alia Shawkat), even though he hasn't asked Alice yet.When Alice turns him down, Danny's life goes into a tailspin.  Not only do most of his classmates already have dates for the prom, uber-nerd Bart Beeber (Chad Jamian Williams) has even secured a date....and a hotel room.  With limited and ever-decreasing choices in potential prom dates, Danny becomes desperate.  He enlists the help of his quirky but very caring father (William H. Macy) and his good friend, Craig (Brandon Hardesty), in order to get a date.  Their collective attempts (or in Craig's case, giving advice from the swimming pool) bring about quite a bit of hilarity.The humor in this film is very light.  There are a couple of laugh-out-loud moments, but the story rarely strays from its even pace.  With that said, the humor is well above-average when compared to similar teen movies.The film also features a wonderful soundtrack.  It's sure to please anybody who enjoys a good horn section.What lifts this film to a higher level the most is the restrained comedic efforts of the cast.  They never push the envelope too far, but they always keep it at an enjoyable level.  William H. Macy shines as Danny's father, who has turned to the web in order to find his soulmate.  His numerous dates in the film (especially the one with Jennifer Tilly) showcase his talent as a comedic actor.  Cheryl Hines does an excellent job as Danny's mother.  She is also looking for love and might just settle for Bob (Jon Polito), a ""decent enough"" guy who's secure and seems to really like being with Danny and his mom.Other standouts in the cast include the aforementioned Hardesty, Shawkat, Kate Micucci in a small but funny role, Dinah Manoff and Michael Mantell as Camille's parents and Brittney Winton, one of Danny's potential dates.I didn't expect much from this film when I started watching it, but I quickly found myself drawn to the characters and the wonderful humor that make up ""Bart Got A Room.""  Young and old fans of teen comedies will enjoy it (although I believe older audiences will enjoy it more).  If you enjoy the work of Macy, Hines, Manoff or anyone else in this film, I think you'll like this film as well.I highly recommend ""Bart Got A Room,"" and consider it a solid purchase.",4,"Check In To This ""Room""",1249603200,"08 7, 2009",2009,2623,"['Danny', 'Stein', 'Steven', 'Kaplan', 'borderline', 'nerd/average', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', 'facing', 'problem', 'most', 'moderate', 'geeks', 'nerds', 'have', 'faced', 'high', 'school', 'getting', 'date', 'prom', 'Initially', 'ask', 'Alice', 'cute', 'very', 'flirty', 'sophomore', 'drives', 'home', 'school', 'so', 'far', 'turn', 'down', 'longtime', 'friend', 'Camille', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'even', ""n't"", 'asked', 'Alice', 'yet.When', 'Alice', 'down', 'Danny', 'life', 'tailspin', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'most', 'classmates', 'already', 'have', 'dates', 'prom', 'uber-nerd', 'Bart', 'Beeber', 'Chad', 'Jamian', 'Williams', 'even', 'secured', 'date', '.and', 'hotel', 'room', 'limited', 'ever-decreasing', 'choices', 'potential', 'prom', 'dates', 'Danny', 'desperate', 'help', 'quirky', 'very', 'caring', 'father', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'good', 'friend', 'Craig', 'Brandon', 'Hardesty', 'order', 'get', 'date', 'collective', 'attempts', 'Craig', 'case', 'giving', 'advice', 'swimming', 'pool', 'bring', 'quite', 'bit', 'hilarity.The', 'humor', 'film', 'very', 'light', 'are', 'couple', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'story', 'rarely', 'even', 'pace', 'said', 'humor', 'well', 'above-average', 'when', 'compared', 'similar', 'teen', 'movies.The', 'film', 'also', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'sure', 'please', 'anybody', 'who', 'good', 'horn', 'section.What', 'film', 'higher', 'level', 'most', 'restrained', 'comedic', 'efforts', 'cast', 'never', 'push', 'envelope', 'too', 'far', 'always', 'keep', 'enjoyable', 'level', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'shines', 'Danny', 'father', 'who', 'turned', 'web', 'order', 'find', 'soulmate', 'numerous', 'dates', 'film', 'especially', 'one', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'showcase', 'talent', 'comedic', 'actor', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'excellent', 'job', 'Danny', 'mother', 'also', 'looking', 'love', 'might', 'just', 'settle', 'Bob', 'Jon', 'Polito', 'decent', 'enough', 'guy', 'who', 'secure', 'really', 'like', 'being', 'Danny', 'mom.Other', 'standouts', 'cast', 'include', 'aforementioned', 'Hardesty', 'Shawkat', 'Kate', 'Micucci', 'small', 'funny', 'role', 'Dinah', 'Manoff', 'Michael', 'Mantell', 'Camille', 'parents', 'Brittney', 'Winton', 'one', 'Danny', 'potential', 'dates.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'film', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'quickly', 'found', 'drawn', 'characters', 'wonderful', 'humor', 'make', 'up', 'Bart', 'Got', 'A', 'Room', 'Young', 'old', 'fans', 'teen', 'comedies', 'will', 'enjoy', 'believe', 'older', 'audiences', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more', 'enjoy', 'work', 'Macy', 'Hines', 'Manoff', 'anyone', 'else', 'film', 'think', ""'ll"", 'like', 'film', 'well.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Bart', 'Got', 'A', 'Room', 'consider', 'solid', 'purchase']",Bart Got a Room

The ending, his date, is almost exactly what you would expect if you have any movie going experience, but the makers seemed to miss a couple key scenes to make that ending emotional rewarding. Instead, the ending seems like a combination of what the formula required and the strange feeling that the lead character was settling so that he could fulfill said formula.Formulas exist for a reason, but characters still have to have chemistry, there still needs to be scenes or moments that leads the characters where the makers wants them to go, and which allows the viewer to really root for them. I rooted for the characters because they were likable enough, and played by likable people, not because I was successfully lead to the point where the ending was anything other than the best ending, sorta.The cast is good, but not given enough in some cases. William H. Macy was funny enough. Cheryl Hines seemed a little wasted, as was Alia Shawkat (of Arrested Development fame.) These are talented women who've proved they can deliver, and yet there wasn't enough for them. Shawkat can be funny and charming, and actually needed to be for the role to really work, but the material was not in the script. Steven Kaplan, the lead, seems promising and convincing as a character in the vein of the role Jason Biggs played in the American Pie movies.This is a version of every teen movie where the male lead is expected to show growth and learn what really matters amidst a few slightly crude -- but funny -- situations. It always remains in the shadows of similar movies, and never adequately finds a unique voice or take.If I'd stumbled across this on TV, it would have been an enjoyable enough movie and I would have probably sat through it. I didn't mind watching the DVD. It could be part of a lazy evening or weekend day at home -- you know, pop some popcorn and cuddle on the couch -- but it's not something I ever anticipate watching again though.What it is is a likable film that shows potential for the makers and potential for the lead, but it's leftover potential after some wasted opportunities.",3,"Cute and Funny, But I've Seen Better -- And So Have You.",1248220800,"07 22, 2009",2009,2315,"['doubt', 'movies', 'cute', 'are', 'laughs', 'cast', 'really', 'good', 'end', 'result', ""n't"", 'rise', 'above', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'laughed', 'nothing', 'here', 'surprised', 'ending', 'date', 'almost', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'have', 'movie', 'going', 'experience', 'makers', 'seemed', 'miss', 'couple', 'key', 'scenes', 'make', 'ending', 'emotional', 'rewarding', 'Instead', 'ending', 'combination', 'what', 'formula', 'required', 'strange', 'feeling', 'lead', 'character', 'was', 'settling', 'so', 'could', 'fulfill', 'said', 'formula.Formulas', 'exist', 'reason', 'characters', 'still', 'have', 'have', 'chemistry', 'still', 'be', 'scenes', 'moments', 'characters', 'where', 'makers', 'go', 'viewer', 'really', 'root', 'rooted', 'characters', 'were', 'likable', 'enough', 'played', 'likable', 'people', 'not', 'was', 'successfully', 'lead', 'point', 'where', 'ending', 'was', 'anything', 'other', 'best', 'ending', 'sorta.The', 'cast', 'good', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'cases', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'was', 'funny', 'enough', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'seemed', 'little', 'wasted', 'was', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'fame', 'are', 'talented', 'women', 'who', ""'ve"", 'proved', 'can', 'deliver', 'yet', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Shawkat', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'charming', 'actually', 'needed', 'be', 'role', 'really', 'work', 'material', 'was', 'not', 'script', 'Steven', 'Kaplan', 'lead', 'promising', 'convincing', 'character', 'vein', 'role', 'Jason', 'Biggs', 'played', 'American', 'Pie', 'movies.This', 'version', 'teen', 'movie', 'where', 'male', 'lead', 'expected', 'show', 'growth', 'learn', 'what', 'really', 'amidst', 'few', 'slightly', 'crude', 'funny', 'situations', 'always', 'shadows', 'similar', 'movies', 'never', 'adequately', 'unique', 'voice', 'take.If', ""'d"", 'stumbled', 'TV', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'sat', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'DVD', 'could', 'be', 'part', 'lazy', 'evening', 'weekend', 'day', 'home', 'know', 'pop', 'popcorn', 'cuddle', 'couch', 'not', 'something', 'ever', 'anticipate', 'watching', 'again', 'likable', 'film', 'potential', 'makers', 'potential', 'lead', 'leftover', 'potential', 'wasted', 'opportunities']",Bart Got a Room

Also fun too see Cheryl Hines in something other than Curb Your Enthusiam... although she makes a great appearance in Henry Poole Was Here.  But the deal maker here is of course, the most underrated, unappreciated, but highly respected William H. Macy.  He does every genre with ease, but there is always that bit of uncomfortable blur or uneasy reaction to his acting.  An actor to bring such distinct emotions to the viewer is quite a talent.This is more of a dark comedy to me, and not a laugh out loud movie. A scenario of teenagers and their problems, but not overly catering to that audience. All with the risque overtones.  We deal with typical situations of date lacking, ego bruising, heart breaking, head banging, marriage breaking, parental intruding, and love making. There are hints at trying to be a bit National Lampoon meets Breakfast Club, with an unsettling nod to a Guffman style and even a little Woody. But it holds it's own with a unique delivery of characters.

Murdock,"[0, 0]","The plot of Bart Got A Room is Danny Stein is looking for a date for his senior prom but didn't bother to ask his best friend whom he has known for eight years, Camille (Alia Shawkat) to the prom. He asks out the hot and attractive sophomore Alice Stryer but she turns him down. Everybody booked a hotel room after prom was over, even the lowliest loser in the class, Bart. The dorky Bart has a date for the prom and was able to get a room at The Embassy Suite. Everybody's got a date except for the academic overachiever Danny. With prom only weeks away, he asks out Debbie Yang after listening to the teacher read her poem aloud in class. It was a lusty and passionate poem filled with sexual innuendo. She says yes but certain conditions must be met: 1. they are not seen together in the prom; 2. No pictures are to be taken because she is in a long distance relationship with somebody else and she doesn't want the photos to wind up in the wrong hands, and 3. they can't be seen dancing together. It's pretty much a Yes disguised as a No.While there were laudable performances from Stephen Kaplan as Danny Stein and William H. Macy as Danny's divorced father Ernie, it wasn't enough to save what was essentially a weak and predictable plot. It is a teenage comedy that has already been told countless of times in hundreds of previously successful teen comedy movies. If you've seen American Pie, Clueless, Mean Girls, Superbad, Can't Hardly Wait, then Bart Got a Room will bore you to tears. The jokes are recycled. And the only remotely funny scene is where Danny, realizing he has no date to the prom, calls his dad at the last minute who is on a blind date with Melinda (Jennifer Tilly) telling him about the predicament he's in. Breaking off his blind date at the last minute, Ernie frantically cruises the streets and finds a hooker to go on a prom date with his son.

1246606,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0021L8UIU,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","Written and directed by Brian Hecker, ""Bart Got a Room"" is a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age tale set in south Florida where high school geek Danny Stein  won't be in the demographic majority for another fifty years yet.  A good Jewish boy, Danny is all excited about attending his senior prom - or at least he would be if he could get the hot sophomore he drives to school every day to agree to go as his date.  Unfortunately, she thinks of him merely as an older-brother type, so Danny is forced to look elsewhere for options, including the Plain Jane Camille (Alia Shawkat), who`s been his best friend since childhood and obviously wishes Danny felt about her the way she feels about him.  Danny also has to contend with the fact that his soon-to-be-divorced parents (wonderfully played by William H. Macy and Cheryl Hines) are already in the market for future spouses and that they keep the understandably mortified youngster continually posted on their dating progress.Though in terms of plotting there's little that separates ""Bart Got a Room"" from countless other films in the same genre, the movie finds a wealth of truth and humor in its deadpan depictions of ordinary life.  Bart and all the figures who inhabit his world go through their days just trying to make the best of bad situations, searching for that one little nugget of happiness that will make the crushing banality of the rest of their lives at least tolerable, if not worthwhile.  For Danny, it's getting a date for the prom and meeting an attractive girl who will reciprocate his romantic interest; for his parents, it's trying to get that one last stab at coupled attachment in a world where youth is prized above all else and where they're faced with a daily reminder of what awaits them in their fast-approaching ""golden years;"" for Camille, it's trying to get the boy she's attracted to to see her as a burgeoning woman with sexual appetites and not just a platonic buddy to study and hang out with.""Bart Got a Room"" nicely captures the exaggerated nature of teenage trauma, when showing up dateless to the prom is a personal tragedy comparable only to the crash of the Hindenburg or the sinking of the Titanic.

But Benson might as well been talking about the movie which may lack any flashy names but is at best watchable even if it falls flat at time.Newcomer Kaplan is the lead of the movie despite not named Bart. It is the fact that even Bart got a room for after prom that makes Kaplan's search for a date even urgent. Naturally underclassmen cheerleader Benson is at the top of the list but there are a few other opportunities Kaplan tries, including a blind date, in hopes of not getting stuck with going with his best friend, Alia Shawkat (Arrested Development), because, much like Bart, we wants to get a room and share it with someone and not just to play Scrabble with all night.Making it harder for Kaplan is that both his recently divorced parents are doing better finding dates. Mom Cheryl Hines (Waitress) has gotten serious and is hoping a question gets asked soon. While dad, William H. Macy (Wild Hogs) has resigned to finding dates in chat rooms (not the kind Chris Hansen trolls, but real adult ones) with mixed result. Bart Got a Room is dependable for a few laughs but is prone to breaking down for short stretches throughout.The DVD does get bonus points for including a Pop-Up Videos style commentary that is much more entertaining than standard audio commentaries.",3,"The Way I See it, You're Kind of Like You're Car",1249862400,"08 10, 2009",2009,1527,"['Early', 'movie', 'Bart', 'got', 'Room', 'Ashley', 'Benson', 'who', 'where', 'cheerleader', 'outfit', 'more', 'often', 'Hayden', 'Panettiere', 'monologue', 'car', 'Steven', 'Kaplan', 'driving', 'around', 'just', 'Steve', 'not', 'flashy', 'dependable', 'Benson', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'been', 'talking', 'movie', 'may', 'lack', 'flashy', 'names', 'best', 'watchable', 'even', 'flat', 'time.Newcomer', 'Kaplan', 'lead', 'movie', 'not', 'named', 'Bart', 'fact', 'even', 'Bart', 'got', 'room', 'prom', 'Kaplan', 'search', 'date', 'even', 'urgent', 'Naturally', 'underclassmen', 'cheerleader', 'Benson', 'top', 'list', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'opportunities', 'Kaplan', 'tries', 'including', 'blind', 'date', 'hopes', 'not', 'getting', 'stuck', 'going', 'best', 'friend', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'much', 'Bart', 'get', 'room', 'share', 'someone', 'not', 'just', 'play', 'Scrabble', 'night.Making', 'harder', 'Kaplan', 'recently', 'divorced', 'parents', 'are', 'doing', 'better', 'finding', 'dates', 'Mom', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'Waitress', 'gotten', 'serious', 'hoping', 'question', 'asked', 'soon', 'dad', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'resigned', 'finding', 'dates', 'chat', 'rooms', 'not', 'kind', 'Chris', 'Hansen', 'trolls', 'real', 'adult', 'ones', 'mixed', 'result', 'Bart', 'Got', 'Room', 'dependable', 'few', 'laughs', 'prone', 'breaking', 'down', 'short', 'stretches', 'throughout.The', 'DVD', 'get', 'bonus', 'points', 'including', 'Pop-Up', 'Videos', 'style', 'commentary', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'standard', 'audio', 'commentaries']",Bart Got a Room
1246608,AIBRTGBN07D6A,B0021L8UIU,Scott,"[0, 0]","""Bart Got a Room"" is a high school comedy that tells the story of nerdy high school senior Danny's (Steven Kaplan) last minute effort to find a date to his high school prom; and the anxiety that surrounds his attempts.  The title is a reference to the character of Bart, who is irrelevant to the story and only significance is that he has a date and a hotel room for prom night, even though he is supposedly even more of a loser than Danny. Although I didn't find anything very exceptional in the film, I did find it laudable that the writer/director Brian Hecker managed to create an entertaining high school comedy that did not revolve around toilet humor, nudity, or focus a large portion of the film on sex.  Danny is not trying to find a prom date so he can lose his virginity, but because he knows this is a right of passage in high school, and that he must find a prom date to avoid graduating as a complete loser.  The concepts presented in the movie are (mostly) realistic and very relatable.  Danny struggles with whether to take a sure thing - his best friend, who will not deliver the desired social status he is looking for, or if he should find someone more attractive and popular.  Danny's decline is visible as the movie progresses and Hecker really creates a sense of compassion among the viewer for his plight.  Another very common theme from the movie occurs when Danny tries to figure out whether the attractive and popular sophomore (Ashley Benson) he drives to school is interested in being his date because she likes him, or if she's using him so she can get invited. Benson did an excellent job of portraying the stereotypical attractive blonde teenager who teases and flirts with guys without even realizing it, then feigns naivety when confronted on it.As I said, most of the film is fairly believable.  From the trailer, I was sure William Macy's character was going to be over the top and come across as the dad that is ridiculously out of touch with teenagers, as unfortunately portrayed in so many of these films (Eugene Levy inAmerican Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)is a classic example). With the exception of two actions that were a bit ridiculous, I found his character to be fairly honest.  Another problem with the film is that Goony newcomer Brandon Hardesty is vastly underutilized in the movie.  It would be nice if his character was portrayed a little more comedically and we got to see some of his Youtube success on the big screen, but he does portray the character as it's meant to be played and does a fine job with it.As far as the DVD, the transfer is fairly good for a budget film. The picture quality has a little bit of noise but it is not noticeable.  I thought the audio quality was excellent and sounded great in 5.1.DVD Special Features:""Pop-up Production Notebook - This is done a lot like VH1's ""Pop-up Video.  Balloons pop-up during the movie with facts about the production.  This is somewhat interesting, but I would have preferred just to have read everything in a few minutes on a single page, like the IMDB trivia section.  Having them integrated into the film didn't add much.Trailer - The requisite trailer is included, as well as trailers for a bunch of other movies from Anchor Bay Entertainment that I don't care about. In addition, I should mention that two trailers are shown automatically, before the main feature starts.  I absolutely hate when films do this on their DVDs.  I am purchasing this movie, not renting it.  Do not force me to skip through ads for unrelated films before I can see my movie.  I don't care about them.  Put these on our web site or find another way to promote them.Overall, Bart Got a Room is a slightly above-average film that was enjoyable to watch, but failed to hold my interest very much.  It is a better class of high school comedy, but it's not likely I will recommend it to anyone anytime soon.  It would have been nice to have included a commentary from Hecker, or even better, a commentary that had Brandon Hardesty, who I believe could have really shined on something like that.",4,"A more sophisticated, but bland high school comedy",1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,4102,"['Bart', 'Got', 'Room', 'high', 'school', 'comedy', 'story', 'nerdy', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'Danny', 'Steven', 'Kaplan', 'last', 'minute', 'effort', 'find', 'date', 'high', 'school', 'prom', 'anxiety', 'attempts', 'title', 'reference', 'character', 'Bart', 'who', 'irrelevant', 'story', 'only', 'significance', 'date', 'hotel', 'room', 'prom', 'night', 'even', 'supposedly', 'even', 'more', 'loser', 'Danny', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'very', 'exceptional', 'film', 'did', 'find', 'laudable', 'writer/director', 'Brian', 'Hecker', 'managed', 'create', 'entertaining', 'high', 'school', 'comedy', 'did', 'not', 'revolve', 'toilet', 'humor', 'nudity', 'focus', 'large', 'portion', 'film', 'sex', 'Danny', 'not', 'trying', 'find', 'prom', 'date', 'can', 'lose', 'virginity', 'right', 'passage', 'high', 'school', 'must', 'find', 'prom', 'date', 'avoid', 'graduating', 'complete', 'loser', 'concepts', 'presented', 'movie', 'are', 'mostly', 'realistic', 'very', 'relatable', 'Danny', 'take', 'sure', 'thing', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'deliver', 'desired', 'social', 'status', 'looking', 'should', 'find', 'someone', 'more', 'attractive', 'popular', 'Danny', 'decline', 'visible', 'movie', 'Hecker', 'really', 'sense', 'compassion', 'viewer', 'plight', 'very', 'common', 'theme', 'movie', 'when', 'Danny', 'figure', 'out', 'attractive', 'popular', 'sophomore', 'Ashley', 'Benson', 'school', 'interested', 'being', 'date', 'using', 'can', 'get', 'invited', 'Benson', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'stereotypical', 'attractive', 'blonde', 'teenager', 'who', 'flirts', 'guys', 'even', 'realizing', 'then', 'naivety', 'when', 'confronted', 'it.As', 'said', 'most', 'film', 'fairly', 'believable', 'trailer', 'was', 'sure', 'William', 'Macy', 'character', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'top', 'come', 'dad', 'ridiculously', 'touch', 'teenagers', 'unfortunately', 'portrayed', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'inAmerican', 'Pie', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'classic', 'example', 'exception', 'two', 'actions', 'were', 'bit', 'ridiculous', 'found', 'character', 'be', 'fairly', 'honest', 'problem', 'film', 'Goony', 'newcomer', 'Brandon', 'Hardesty', 'vastly', 'underutilized', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'character', 'was', 'portrayed', 'little', 'more', 'comedically', 'got', 'see', 'Youtube', 'success', 'big', 'screen', 'portray', 'character', 'meant', 'be', 'played', 'fine', 'job', 'it.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'fairly', 'good', 'budget', 'film', 'picture', 'quality', 'little', 'bit', 'noise', 'not', 'noticeable', 'thought', 'audio', 'quality', 'was', 'excellent', 'sounded', 'great', '5.1.DVD', 'Special', 'Features', 'Pop-up', 'Production', 'Notebook', 'done', 'lot', 'VH1', 'Pop-up', 'Video', 'Balloons', 'pop-up', 'movie', 'facts', 'production', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'just', 'have', 'read', 'everything', 'few', 'minutes', 'single', 'page', 'IMDB', 'trivia', 'section', 'Having', 'integrated', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'much.Trailer', 'requisite', 'trailer', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'trailers', 'bunch', 'other', 'movies', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'about', 'addition', 'should', 'mention', 'two', 'trailers', 'are', 'shown', 'automatically', 'main', 'feature', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'when', 'films', 'do', 'DVDs', 'am', 'purchasing', 'movie', 'not', 'renting', 'Do', 'not', 'force', 'skip', 'ads', 'unrelated', 'films', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Put', 'web', 'site', 'find', 'way', 'promote', 'them.Overall', 'Bart', 'Got', 'Room', 'slightly', 'above-average', 'film', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'failed', 'hold', 'interest', 'very', 'much', 'better', 'class', 'high', 'school', 'comedy', 'not', 'likely', 'will', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'anytime', 'soon', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'included', 'commentary', 'Hecker', 'even', 'better', 'commentary', 'had', 'Brandon', 'Hardesty', 'who', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'shined', 'something']",Bart Got a Room

In the midst of this quest are all sorts of complications and plenty of side stories including his wacky parents who are going through a divorce and both trying to find new mates themselves.What made this movie fun and enjoyable for me is that it was easy to relate to, it was very honest, and despite the movie itself having a pretty clich&eacute; plot it managed to feel fresh and funny. I think this film successfully draws the line in having some great adult humor but not being overly raunchy (I have nothing against raunchy comedies, in fact I love them most of the time... but it's nice to see a movie be funny without going overboard).

Except for a vibrating cell phone and a scene where a character uses and online dating service, there's not much to show it was made in 2009. And the humor, with a few naughty words but not hard ones - and sex is mentioned in the form of a simulated masturbation scene, is pretty mild. Even the usually erotic Jennifer Tilly is mild here with only a short scene.That's not to say I hated the movie. Its good for a rental and - at just 79 minutes - is easy to sit through. Most males can relate to the story of finding a date for their high school prom -but probably not at the last minute - and this is where the film succeeds. As a moral tale, though it really fails. Danny (the central character) ignores his best female friend until - literally - the last hour or two before the prom. Then, when he can't find a date, and she has accepted another offer, we are supposed to feel sorry for him. He deserved it! And I didn't go for the hokey ending.I like William A. Macy, but this role -with the really dumb Harpo Marx wig he is wearing throughout the film - is not IMHO his best.Writer Director Brian Hecker hits every Jewish ethnic stereotype he can find. The guys are all Jewish with big noses. Seniors in Florida abound looking like wrinkled prunes in colorful clothes. We even get the requisite Bar Mitzvah scene. I'm sure some Jews will be offended.I won't go into the plot because its in other reviews.The bonuses include a really dumb idea: A pop-up production notebook.

1246613,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B0021L8UIU,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[4, 4]","What I liked about ""Bart Got a Room"" is its easygoing charm.  This is not one of those frenetic, loud teen comedies in which implausible characters engage in outrageous actions that in no way resemble reality.  Here we have the story of high school senior Danny (Steven Kaplan), who's spent a small fortune on the hotel room, limo, and tux for his prom.  What he doesn't have is a date.  The always-wonderful William H. Macy, complete with black curly wig, and Cheryl Hines play Steven's divorced parents, both self-absorbed with seeking relationships of their own.  ""Bart Got a Room"" is not a rollicking movie with wisecarcks issuing forth from precocious teens' mouths every few seconds.  The comedy is more about Steven's awkwardness in deciding who to take to the prom.  Since he's not the cliched football hero girls would be eager to accompany to the prom,  Steven is sympathetic with his ordinary looks, gentle temperament, and overall sweetness. Alia Shawkat is very good as Camille, Steven's longtime friend, and Jennifer Tilly pops up as an overly amorous woman Steven's dad met online.  There are wonderful little moments here and there of South Floridians doing what they do -- hanging out on the beach, playing cards, having the Early Bird Special, listening to a sparsely-attended concert of 40's music -- which add nice atmosphere to the movie.  There is a brief scene at the beginning of Steven and his family having dinner.  The interaction here is very funny, in a natural way, and I'd like to have seen more. There's comic potential in some supporting characters that is not fully mined.  As far as the bonus extras, I wasn't able to access the Pop-Up Production Notebook and the theatrical trailer.  I don't know if this is an inherent problem with the release or unique to the disc I watched.

1246614,A11SLQAPJILM6O,B0021L8UIU,"Todd M. Barty ""Fab Fan""","[1, 1]","The cast in this film are wonderful, subtle, and honest in this really fresh take on the teen comedy genre.Steven Kaplan shines as the awkward, conflicted teenhero , Danny, buckling under the pressure of his oncoming Prom and the enormous status that his culture attaches to it. Rather than allowing him to enjoy an evening of fun with his childhood friend, (Played with both humour and sadness by Alia Shawkat), Danny pursues the dream of landing a hot date to share his pre-booked limo and hotel room.The frustration of both Kaplan and Shawkat's charaters is palpable as time runs out and their special moment threatens to be ruined by the hype and hormones beseiging Danny.The real thrill of this film is that it explores friendship and family in a dry and honest way - and does not veer into sentimentalism or romance. William H. Macey and Cheryl Hines are a delight as Danny's dysfunctional parents, creating believably cringe-worthy  situations.Ashley Benson is pretty, believable and perfect as Danny's dream girl - the ambiguous, teasing friend who turns out to think of him as a brother. It would be great to see more of her.See this film - it is funny and charming.",4,Refreshing take on teen angst,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,1175,"['cast', 'film', 'are', 'wonderful', 'subtle', 'honest', 'really', 'fresh', 'take', 'teen', 'comedy', 'genre.Steven', 'Kaplan', 'awkward', 'conflicted', 'teenhero', 'Danny', 'buckling', 'pressure', 'oncoming', 'Prom', 'enormous', 'status', 'culture', 'Rather', 'allowing', 'enjoy', 'evening', 'fun', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Played', 'humour', 'sadness', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'Danny', 'dream', 'landing', 'hot', 'date', 'share', 'pre-booked', 'limo', 'hotel', 'room.The', 'frustration', 'Kaplan', 'Shawkat', 'charaters', 'palpable', 'time', 'out', 'special', 'moment', 'threatens', 'be', 'ruined', 'hype', 'hormones', 'beseiging', 'Danny.The', 'real', 'thrill', 'film', 'friendship', 'family', 'dry', 'honest', 'way', 'not', 'veer', 'sentimentalism', 'romance', 'William', 'H.', 'Macey', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'are', 'delight', 'Danny', 'dysfunctional', 'parents', 'creating', 'believably', 'cringe-worthy', 'situations.Ashley', 'Benson', 'pretty', 'believable', 'perfect', 'Danny', 'dream', 'girl', 'ambiguous', 'teasing', 'friend', 'who', 'out', 'think', 'brother', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'see', 'more', 'her.See', 'film', 'funny', 'charming']",Bart Got a Room
1246615,A3MUSWDCTZINQZ,B0021L8UIU,"Ulalume Jones ""Creative Gal""","[1, 1]","Bart Got a Room is one of those could have been great films, drawing from the John Hughes school of teen angst comedy.  It starts out with a bang...jazz music.  I find most teen comedies have a lot of really bad rock in them, like Blink 182 or similar band.  So, from the beginning, it seemed like a movie for teens, but something where the writing was better than average.  And indeed this is a mix of both teen and dysfunctional family comedy.Both the title of the DVD and design of the cover is misleading.  This isn't a movie where the clever yet dead eyed lead is dropping his pants for the girl, quite the opposite.  The title is repeated like a manta, which brings up the John Hughes quality, but Bart plays such a minor part in the movie, other than to represent how the dweeb of the school is cooler than the lead character.Other than that, I found the movie very humorous.  My boyfriend laughed every time he saw William H. Macy, with his high hair.  He's more into the dysfunctional family comedies than I am.  The actors are what drew me to this film.  I enjoy Alia Shawkat's work in Arrested Development and she fits well here, playing the best friend of the male lead who thinks it would be cool to go to the prom with him, while he has other ideas. I even spotted two people I loved on the show Scrubs, Kate Micucci and Cheryl Hines.  Jennifer Tilly even makes a short but memorable appearance.The plot is pretty straight forward.  Guy from standard movie fare dysfunctional Jewish family wants to make his prom special by buying a hotel room, limo and everything else for his prom.  The only problem is he doesn't have a girlfriend and his parents are pushing him to take his best friend.  The guy has other ideas and  haphazardly makes his way from one girl to another, trying to seal the deal.  At the end, which is funny, because it does remind me of Scrubs, a voiceover ending makes it a much deeper affair, where he ends up learning about himself and life.The music really does help the movie along.  I remember a John Hughes like music cue at the end of a class room scene where the lead is trying to ask a girl out based on an erotic poem she wrote. There is the traditional slow walking hot girl scene.  Bart, himself, reminds me of the climax of a Hughes scene, the punch line.  Bart is just not strong enough to give the film its title.  I wish he was.  Other Hughes like items are when the women leaves the restaurant suddenly.  Or when the old lady comes to the door with cookies.Despite any flaws it has, Bart Got a Room, is a good solid film.  It made me laugh and if you like offbeat silly comedies with more meat in them than your average teen film, then this would be for you.  I could probably watch it more than once and I keep reading about how there is something at the end of the credits, so maybe I should watch the end again.",5,"Brings up memories of Johh Hughes, if he wrote dysfunctional family comedies...",1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,2865,"['Bart', 'Got', 'Room', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'films', 'drawing', 'John', 'Hughes', 'school', 'teen', 'angst', 'comedy', 'out', 'bang', 'jazz', 'music', 'find', 'most', 'teen', 'comedies', 'have', 'lot', 'really', 'bad', 'rock', 'Blink', '182', 'similar', 'band', 'So', 'beginning', 'seemed', 'movie', 'teens', 'something', 'where', 'writing', 'was', 'better', 'average', 'indeed', 'mix', 'teen', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'title', 'DVD', 'design', 'cover', 'misleading', ""n't"", 'movie', 'where', 'clever', 'yet', 'dead', 'eyed', 'lead', 'dropping', 'pants', 'girl', 'quite', 'opposite', 'title', 'repeated', 'manta', 'up', 'John', 'Hughes', 'quality', 'Bart', 'minor', 'part', 'movie', 'other', 'represent', 'how', 'dweeb', 'school', 'cooler', 'lead', 'character.Other', 'found', 'movie', 'very', 'humorous', 'boyfriend', 'laughed', 'time', 'saw', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'high', 'hair', 'more', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'comedies', 'am', 'actors', 'are', 'what', 'drew', 'film', 'enjoy', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'work', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'well', 'here', 'playing', 'best', 'friend', 'male', 'lead', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'go', 'prom', 'other', 'ideas', 'even', 'spotted', 'two', 'people', 'loved', 'show', 'Scrubs', 'Kate', 'Micucci', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'even', 'short', 'memorable', 'appearance.The', 'plot', 'pretty', 'straight', 'forward', 'Guy', 'standard', 'movie', 'fare', 'dysfunctional', 'Jewish', 'family', 'make', 'prom', 'special', 'buying', 'hotel', 'room', 'limo', 'everything', 'else', 'prom', 'only', 'problem', ""n't"", 'have', 'girlfriend', 'parents', 'are', 'pushing', 'take', 'best', 'friend', 'guy', 'other', 'ideas', 'haphazardly', 'way', 'one', 'girl', 'trying', 'seal', 'deal', 'end', 'funny', 'remind', 'Scrubs', 'voiceover', 'ending', 'much', 'deeper', 'affair', 'where', 'up', 'learning', 'life.The', 'music', 'really', 'help', 'movie', 'remember', 'John', 'Hughes', 'music', 'cue', 'end', 'class', 'room', 'scene', 'where', 'lead', 'trying', 'ask', 'girl', 'out', 'based', 'erotic', 'poem', 'wrote', 'traditional', 'slow', 'walking', 'hot', 'girl', 'scene', 'Bart', 'climax', 'Hughes', 'scene', 'punch', 'line', 'Bart', 'just', 'not', 'strong', 'enough', 'give', 'film', 'title', 'wish', 'was', 'Other', 'Hughes', 'items', 'are', 'when', 'women', 'restaurant', 'suddenly', 'when', 'old', 'lady', 'door', 'cookies.Despite', 'flaws', 'Bart', 'Got', 'Room', 'good', 'solid', 'film', 'made', 'like', 'offbeat', 'silly', 'comedies', 'more', 'meat', 'average', 'teen', 'film', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'could', 'probably', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'keep', 'reading', 'how', 'something', 'end', 'credits', 'maybe', 'should', 'watch', 'end', 'again']",Bart Got a Room

Bart is not the starring character but the apex of someone who would not be able to get a date for the prom much less one who would need a hotel room afterwards - so if he can do it anyone else should have a date and a room afterwards. Danny is the main character whose divorced parents try to aid him in his life including what he and they seemingly hope would be a sexual fulfillment. Danny's longtime female buddy wants to go to the prom but Danny would prefer to go with the popular, pretty blond cheerleader.If the fact that males seem to continue this behavior where even the not handsome, not popular jock dreams and thinks he might have the most popular girl in school. ..if this type of behavior is irritating then you might want to stay away from this movie.There is humor in the mess he makes of his prom, even lacking a date less than an hour before prom time. What will bring a smile is the ending...all's well that ends well for everybody.The DVD has some extras, subtitles in English and Spanish. There are pop up production notes but they come and disappear very fast and unless you have a very large screen TV it's hard to read them.In total it's a pleasant diversion of a movie with some sexual innuendo - but not a total waste of time.",3,the perfect moment?,1248134400,"07 21, 2009",2009,1383,"[""'Bart"", 'Got', 'A', 'Room', 'almost', 'modern', 'day', 'version', '60', 'beach', 'movies', 'teenage', 'life', 'shown', 'humor', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'Bart', 'not', 'starring', 'character', 'apex', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'date', 'prom', 'much', 'less', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'need', 'hotel', 'room', 'afterwards', 'so', 'can', 'do', 'anyone', 'else', 'should', 'have', 'date', 'room', 'afterwards', 'Danny', 'main', 'character', 'divorced', 'parents', 'try', 'aid', 'life', 'including', 'what', 'seemingly', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'sexual', 'fulfillment', 'Danny', 'longtime', 'female', 'buddy', 'go', 'prom', 'Danny', 'would', 'prefer', 'go', 'popular', 'pretty', 'blond', 'fact', 'seem', 'continue', 'behavior', 'where', 'even', 'not', 'handsome', 'not', 'popular', 'jock', 'dreams', 'thinks', 'might', 'have', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', '..if', 'type', 'behavior', 'irritating', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'stay', 'away', 'movie.There', 'humor', 'mess', 'prom', 'even', 'lacking', 'date', 'less', 'hour', 'prom', 'time', 'What', 'will', 'bring', 'smile', 'ending', 'well', 'well', 'everybody.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish', 'are', 'up', 'production', 'notes', 'come', 'disappear', 'very', 'fast', 'have', 'very', 'large', 'screen', 'TV', 'hard', 'read', 'them.In', 'total', 'pleasant', 'diversion', 'movie', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'not', 'total', 'waste', 'time']",Bart Got a Room
1246617,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0021L8UIU,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[1, 2]","Movies about teenage maturity and the goal for the perfect date for a prom have been done many, many times before. Director Brian Hecker's ""Bart Got a Room"" follows the usual formulaic approach to an overused premise; the film offers nothing significant and quite honestly, quite insubstantial. However, thanks to Hecker's solid direction and comic book-like approach, the film does have its charm; it has that goofy but has that likeable sensibility. Yes, it may be one of those ""coming of age"" flicks once again...Danny Stein (nope he's not ""Bart"", Bart is the supposed biggest loser in his school) is a high school senior who is under a lot of pressure when ""prom fever"" sweeps over the entire high school. The pressure of getting dates, limos and hotel rooms are all summed up in ""even Bart got a room"". This bit of info springs Danny (Steven Kaplan) into making a night to remember, even his divorced parents Arnie and Beth (William H. Macy and Cheryl Hines) wouldn't want their son to be outshone by Bart. Danny's been asked to the prom by his childhood friend, Camille (Alia Shawkat) but he has his eyes on hotter, bigger game personified by Alice (Ashley Benson), the knockout cheerleader whom he drives to school everyday. When Alice turns him down, Danny scrambles for a date, without knowing that the best date he could ever have may be right in front of him...The movie ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" did this story extremely well in the 80's (at least I thought when I was in College) and Hecker's film follows the exact same formula. While that 80's film had a more serious romantic tone, the film's direction does try to overcome its formulaic roots with a very comic-book like approach. The way the film is composed is witty, funny and charming, director Brian Hecker may have the most overused premise in teenage comedy but he does the deed with a great eye for detail and structure. Hecker throws in some jokes in the sidelines and the occasional use of wide framing. The film is quite honest in its execution specifically its messages about sex but it isn't raunchy or dirty; pretty clean in the way it discusses the topic.It also remembers to expose the parallels between teenage and adult dating; frankly both sides can be `oversexed`. Danny's parents have started dating other people; but it also does prove very easy for them. William H. Macy is absolutely wonderful in his role as Arnie, he just stole the show with his attempts to give advice to his son and most notably in his efforts to find a new woman in his life. It was surprisingly delightful to see Macy sport that weird hairdo, a rusty old Mercedes Benz, and a thinly-walled new apartment. Cheryl Hines is also wonderful as the mom, trying to date a secure suitor; her character embodies that ""cool"" mom. Kaplan reminded me of Biggs in ""American Pie"", mixed in with a low dose of ""Napoleon Dynamite"".The film does make the use of what it's got quite well. I loved the scenes when Danny becomes enthralled by the lust of his eyes, personified by Alice and later by Camille's sister Brittney (Tyler O`Campo). It shows a bit of its raunchy side but stayed within the confines of just being adorable rather than becoming vulgar. But there was a significant low point in the script that felt a little too tasteless. The scene where Danny is with a Chinese family felt totally unnecessary that I wouldn't surprised if it stirred some flags.""Bart Got a Room"" may not become a comedy classic, but it is still a good-natured, endearing teen comedy. The film is nicely paced at 79 minutes (including credits) and while it won't make you laugh out loud, you will find yourself snickering a lot of times. Macy and Hines are definitely the film's high points and newcomer Steven Kaplan isn't so bad either. It is a decent comedy for those just looking for a quick laugh.Recommended! [3 Stars= good but a mixed bag]Video/Audio: 1.85 ratio anamorphic widescreen. The film looks very bright with a use of strong colors that gives it a comical tone. It does look very grainy on some scenes. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is good for this type of movie.",3,Funny and Endearing Teen Comedy...,1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,4111,"['Movies', 'teenage', 'maturity', 'goal', 'perfect', 'date', 'prom', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'Director', 'Brian', 'Hecker', 'Bart', 'Got', 'Room', 'usual', 'formulaic', 'approach', 'overused', 'premise', 'film', 'nothing', 'significant', 'quite', 'honestly', 'quite', 'insubstantial', 'However', 'thanks', 'Hecker', 'solid', 'direction', 'comic', 'book-like', 'approach', 'film', 'have', 'charm', 'goofy', 'likeable', 'sensibility', 'Yes', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'coming', 'age', 'flicks', 'once', 'again', 'Danny', 'Stein', 'not', 'Bart', 'Bart', 'supposed', 'biggest', 'loser', 'school', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'who', 'lot', 'pressure', 'when', 'prom', 'fever', 'sweeps', 'entire', 'high', 'school', 'pressure', 'getting', 'dates', 'limos', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'are', 'summed', 'up', 'even', 'Bart', 'got', 'room', 'bit', 'info', 'springs', 'Danny', 'Steven', 'Kaplan', 'making', 'night', 'remember', 'even', 'divorced', 'parents', 'Arnie', 'Beth', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'son', 'be', 'outshone', 'Bart', 'Danny', 'been', 'asked', 'prom', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Camille', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'eyes', 'hotter', 'bigger', 'game', 'personified', 'Alice', 'Ashley', 'Benson', 'knockout', 'cheerleader', 'whom', 'school', 'everyday', 'When', 'Alice', 'down', 'Danny', 'date', 'knowing', 'best', 'date', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'front', 'movie', 'Kind', 'Wonderful', 'did', 'story', 'extremely', 'well', '80', 'least', 'thought', 'when', 'was', 'College', 'Hecker', 'film', 'exact', 'same', 'formula', '80', 'film', 'had', 'more', 'serious', 'romantic', 'tone', 'film', 'direction', 'try', 'overcome', 'formulaic', 'roots', 'very', 'comic-book', 'approach', 'way', 'film', 'composed', 'witty', 'funny', 'charming', 'director', 'Brian', 'Hecker', 'may', 'have', 'most', 'overused', 'premise', 'teenage', 'comedy', 'deed', 'great', 'eye', 'detail', 'structure', 'Hecker', 'jokes', 'sidelines', 'occasional', 'use', 'wide', 'framing', 'film', 'quite', 'honest', 'execution', 'specifically', 'messages', 'sex', ""n't"", 'raunchy', 'dirty', 'pretty', 'clean', 'way', 'topic.It', 'also', 'expose', 'parallels', 'teenage', 'adult', 'dating', 'frankly', 'sides', 'can', 'be', 'oversexed', 'Danny', 'parents', 'have', 'started', 'dating', 'other', 'people', 'also', 'prove', 'very', 'easy', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'role', 'Arnie', 'just', 'stole', 'show', 'attempts', 'give', 'advice', 'son', 'most', 'notably', 'efforts', 'find', 'new', 'woman', 'life', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'delightful', 'see', 'Macy', 'sport', 'weird', 'hairdo', 'rusty', 'old', 'Mercedes', 'Benz', 'thinly-walled', 'new', 'apartment', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'also', 'wonderful', 'mom', 'trying', 'date', 'secure', 'suitor', 'character', 'cool', 'mom', 'Kaplan', 'reminded', 'Biggs', 'American', 'Pie', 'mixed', 'low', 'dose', 'Napoleon', 'Dynamite', '.The', 'film', 'make', 'use', 'what', 'got', 'quite', 'well', 'loved', 'scenes', 'when', 'Danny', 'enthralled', 'lust', 'eyes', 'personified', 'Alice', 'later', 'Camille', 'sister', 'Brittney', 'Tyler', 'O', 'Campo', 'bit', 'raunchy', 'side', 'stayed', 'confines', 'just', 'being', 'adorable', 'rather', 'becoming', 'vulgar', 'was', 'significant', 'low', 'point', 'script', 'felt', 'little', 'too', 'tasteless', 'scene', 'where', 'Danny', 'Chinese', 'family', 'felt', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'would', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'stirred', 'flags', 'Bart', 'Got', 'Room', 'may', 'not', 'become', 'comedy', 'classic', 'still', 'good-natured', 'endearing', 'teen', 'comedy', 'film', 'nicely', 'paced', '79', 'minutes', 'including', 'credits', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'loud', 'will', 'find', 'snickering', 'lot', 'times', 'Macy', 'Hines', 'are', 'definitely', 'film', 'high', 'points', 'newcomer', 'Steven', 'Kaplan', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'either', 'decent', 'comedy', 'just', 'looking', 'quick', 'laugh.Recommended', '3', 'Stars=', 'good', 'mixed', 'bag', ']', 'Video/Audio', '1.85', 'ratio', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'film', 'very', 'bright', 'use', 'strong', 'colors', 'comical', 'tone', 'look', 'very', 'grainy', 'scenes', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'track', 'good', 'type', 'movie']",Bart Got a Room
