1104112,A2F09EWKV3MTO2,B000VT6ZUE,StillWaters,"[3, 3]","This movie started out really good, the storyline was interesting and it had promise. Kelly Martin did a great job in her part. As the movie went on there were several obvious mistakes that made it seem silly. After the two women are attacked and escape to the RV with no belongings, all of a sudden the next day they both have brand new fashionable outfits on. And where exactly did those come from?The plot becomes more and more predictable as the movie goes on, and Kelly Martin's character ends up disappointing with her extreme stupidity toward the end. She spends the whole movie being smart and making good decisions, and then once she talks to her husband again she apparantly loses her capacity to think. If the end had not ended up being so predictable and silly this may have been a good film.",3,Somewhat disappointing,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",2011,804,"['movie', 'started', 'out', 'really', 'good', 'storyline', 'was', 'interesting', 'had', 'promise', 'Kelly', 'Martin', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'part', 'movie', 'went', 'were', 'several', 'obvious', 'mistakes', 'made', 'seem', 'silly', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'attacked', 'escape', 'RV', 'belongings', 'sudden', 'next', 'day', 'have', 'brand', 'new', 'fashionable', 'outfits', 'where', 'exactly', 'did', 'come', 'plot', 'more', 'more', 'predictable', 'movie', 'Kelly', 'Martin', 'character', 'up', 'disappointing', 'extreme', 'stupidity', 'end', 'whole', 'movie', 'being', 'smart', 'making', 'good', 'decisions', 'then', 'once', 'husband', 'again', 'apparantly', 'capacity', 'think', 'end', 'had', 'not', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'so', 'predictable', 'silly', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'film']","Live Once, Die Twice"
