255631,A22JR9ROYRPN7P,6301562925,ANAN KHALIQUE,"[3, 4]","A good, worthy sequel in the series.The film starts with a flashback of the ending to Halloween 4. After that, it's shown here that Michael just barely gets out of the way of the bomb or whatever it was that the cops dropped down the shaft. But he's injured from all the gunshots. A hermit takes care of him. A year later, he kills him. No gratitude from Myers. But what do you expect from someone like Myers, knowing him? He then gets his mask and on he goes for his next collection of victims. He gets a different version of the mask for his film. Jamie, Rachael and her friend (I think her name is Tina) return from the 4th film as does Loomis. In this film, it's revealed that by touching Michael at the end of the previous film, Jamie develops a telepathic link to Myers. She can sense where he is and when he's near. She doesn't speak till later on. While I understand why Loomis kept telling her for help, I felt bad for her. But after Tina's death, she agrees to help. One of, if not the best dialogues is when Myers waits by a tree and Loomis tells him to go home if he wants to stop the evil that will destroy him too and that she'll be there waiting for him. I'm guessing by she, he means Jamie since she is his target.A scary scene is when Myers stalks Jamie, who sees Rachel's dead body and hides. A very, very sick sequence is when when she opens up and falls down a laundry chute, but tries to get back up when he repeatedly stabs it trying to get her. It shows just how sick, relentless, and determined Michael is.One of the best moments and an emotional one is when Jamie says, ""Uncle."" And he stops. She says, ""Let me see."" He removes his mask and you see a tear on his face. Many say it symbolizes that he feels guilty or sad for his actions. You can draw your own conclusion after the revelation of the next film. This only lasts for a second as Michael snaps back into rage mode when Jamie touches him. Had that moment lasted longer, maybe....just maybe that would have been the time for him to say something as he was human and showing emotion for the first time. Another sad scene is Rachel's death. As well as Tina's, who sacrificed herself to save Jamie as both were being stalked by Michael after the Halloween party at the barn Tina went to was finished.Myers is finally stopped when he's trapped and hit by Loomis with a tranquilizer and beats pn him Michael with a wooden object while saying ""Die."" repeatedly. Not the best way to stop him. But it proved effective for the time being. Michael is taken to prison, but is freed by a mysterious Man In Black. More on him will be revealed in the next film.By the way, this is the first and only time I've ever seen Michael kissed. This happens when he wears a different mask and drives Tina to the Halloween party. She kisses him thinking it's her boyfriend. But she gets angry when he doesn't respond to her. After she gets out of the car, he talks off the mask and puts on his Myers mask.",5,MYERS' REVENGE,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,2965,"['good', 'worthy', 'sequel', 'series.The', 'film', 'flashback', 'ending', 'Halloween', '4', 'shown', 'here', 'Michael', 'just', 'barely', 'way', 'bomb', 'whatever', 'was', 'cops', 'dropped', 'shaft', 'injured', 'gunshots', 'hermit', 'care', 'year', 'later', 'gratitude', 'Myers', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'someone', 'Myers', 'knowing', 'then', 'mask', 'next', 'collection', 'victims', 'different', 'version', 'mask', 'film', 'Jamie', 'Rachael', 'friend', 'think', 'name', 'Tina', 'return', '4th', 'film', 'Loomis', 'film', 'revealed', 'touching', 'Michael', 'end', 'previous', 'film', 'Jamie', 'telepathic', 'link', 'Myers', 'can', 'sense', 'where', 'when', 'near', ""n't"", 'speak', 'till', 'later', 'understand', 'why', 'Loomis', 'kept', 'telling', 'help', 'felt', 'bad', 'Tina', 'death', 'help', 'One', 'not', 'best', 'dialogues', 'when', 'Myers', 'waits', 'tree', 'Loomis', 'go', 'home', 'stop', 'evil', 'will', 'destroy', 'too', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there', 'waiting', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'Jamie', 'target.A', 'scary', 'scene', 'when', 'Myers', 'stalks', 'Jamie', 'who', 'Rachel', 'dead', 'body', 'hides', 'very', 'very', 'sick', 'sequence', 'when', 'when', 'up', 'down', 'laundry', 'chute', 'tries', 'get', 'back', 'up', 'when', 'repeatedly', 'stabs', 'trying', 'get', 'just', 'how', 'sick', 'relentless', 'determined', 'Michael', 'is.One', 'best', 'moments', 'emotional', 'one', 'when', 'Jamie', 'Uncle', 'Let', 'see', 'mask', 'see', 'tear', 'face', 'Many', 'say', 'guilty', 'sad', 'actions', 'can', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusion', 'revelation', 'next', 'film', 'only', 'second', 'Michael', 'back', 'rage', 'mode', 'when', 'Jamie', 'Had', 'moment', 'lasted', 'longer', 'maybe', '.just', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'time', 'say', 'something', 'was', 'human', 'showing', 'emotion', 'first', 'time', 'sad', 'scene', 'Rachel', 'death', 'As', 'well', 'Tina', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'save', 'Jamie', 'were', 'being', 'stalked', 'Michael', 'Halloween', 'party', 'barn', 'Tina', 'went', 'was', 'finished.Myers', 'finally', 'stopped', 'when', 'trapped', 'hit', 'Loomis', 'tranquilizer', 'beats', 'pn', 'Michael', 'wooden', 'object', 'saying', 'Die', 'repeatedly', 'Not', 'best', 'way', 'stop', 'proved', 'effective', 'time', 'being', 'Michael', 'taken', 'prison', 'freed', 'mysterious', 'Man', 'Black', 'More', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'next', 'film.By', 'way', 'first', 'only', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Michael', 'kissed', 'when', 'different', 'mask', 'Tina', 'Halloween', 'party', 'thinking', 'boyfriend', 'angry', 'when', ""n't"", 'respond', 'car', 'mask', 'Myers', 'mask']",Halloween 5 VHS

255638,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,6301562925,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[3, 4]","There is great debate over this film among the die hard fans. They either love it or hate it. It's a film that has definitley lost it's way, but makes up for it by being fun. Yes, I think it was quite fun. It's not near as bad as they would lead you to believe. Halloween 5 takes up where the more superior Halloween 4 left off a year earlier. Little niece Jamie now has a psychic bond with Michael. Loomis is back and uses Jamie's link to him to try and track him down. Okay, the psychic link thing was kinda stupid and a stretch for a plot but, strangely, it works. I don't know why.Danielle Harris as Jamie is one of the best young kid actors I've seen. Her performance here and in Part 4 are both very well done performances. She is real and very believeable. Plus, she's adorable. Donald Pleasance continues his roll as slightly demented Dr. Loomis, and you love watching every minute he's on screen. By this time, Loomis has gone a little mad himself. He is a determined man on a mission. He won't stop until Michael has been. It is Mr. Pleasance who is the center of these films. The heart and soul of them. Not Michael Myers. It's a huge disappointment that Ellie Cornell, who plays Rachel, has a smaller role. She's a beauty with good talent. To use her so little in this film was a mistake. She and the character of Rachel should've had more to do. The mask of Michael Myers is debatable. The forehead was too high and the hair too long. It was not a good mask. It looks nothing like the one in Part 4. Nothing happened to that mask, but it is quite different in this film. The film has really sharp choreography. It's one of the better looking films in the series. If you could only give one good credit to this film, it's that it looks darn good. The film definitley has the look and feel of October. That is very important in these movies.  The scene with Michael unmasking and shedding a tear was emotional. It showed that Michael isn't a zombie or a ghost. He is real flesh and blood. He just happens to kill people. Lots and lots of people!. Don Shanks is the stuntman to don the mask this time. He is a solid addition to the mask of Michael. If only the mask were as good as he was!. One of the things that this movie does with Michael that is bad is that they turn him into just another savage slasher like Jason. Michael doesn't rack up huge body counts with excessive blood and brutal slashings. It's not the character. That has changed thru out the series. This is one where he is in 'Jason' mode. And finally, the mystery man in black was a bizarre addition to the story. What point was there to this?. Do we, the audience, benefit from this?. No. Not in the least. It was a ridiculous attempt by the screenwriter to add another story. It doesn't work. Halloween 5 is by no means a classic. It's a routine slasher film, but it's got great entertainment and suspense. A worthy sequel. Part 4 is still much better.

255639,AE0E6UII0VSZA,6301562925,Blake Kleiner,"[1, 1]","The biggest reason I praise this film is its director's new style, that completely reshapes the way the film feels, the way the film was shot, and the way the film affects you as a viewer. Dominique Othenin-Girard is, in a word, merciless. I'm still unclear as to the gender of this director, but I'll say she just because I pronounce the name the French way... at least, I think it's the French way... could be some other language. Oh well, I don't care anymore. Anyway, back to the director. The first thing to capture my attention about the varying style of this fifth installment in the &quot;Halloween&quot; series is how Michael Myers is seen more as a character that the other members of the cast have to deal with instead of seeing him jump out of the shadows and then leap out of sight, just quick enough to make a kill. When Michael is in the room, we always see him, either in the foreground, or lurking somewhere in the fog. It's a new way of watching him in action, and it's oddly engaging to see it executed by this director I don't think we've seen or heard from since. In addition to the style, we have Danielle Harris as Jamie Lloyd, once again delivering a performance that should've been remembered around Oscar season. She is terrific in every sense of the word. I love her performance through and through, and when she is being chased through the Tower Farm by Michael Myers in a car, and the fog hits the lights of the car in some Spielbergian fashion, my heart skips a beat. Like I said, Othenin-Girard is merciless. The violence that surrounds this child is not watered down or hidden away in the shadows. It's right there, and she sees it, and is affected by it. Oh, and I give special kudos to Alan Howarth for composing a unique horror film score. I own it, and I listen to it every once in a while, when I'm tired of traditional film music. The sounds of shattering glass and flashing blades should be a part of other film scores.

255641,A1YB29BIDULEYE,6301562925,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[2, 3]","I'll begin by giving a brief rundown of where I stand. The 1st Halloween was a classic, and will probably be seen by most people as the best. Part 2 was a decent watchable movie. Part 3, as most of you know, has nothing to do with the series, so we'll just say no comment. (I did kind of like Part 3, but it is not really part of this story.) In my opinion, Part 4 was a big improvement. Looking ahead, Part 6 had its moments. After Part 6, with the wonderful Donald Pleasence 'Dr. Loomis' gone, (God Rest His Soul), the 2 movies that followed were pure trash to say the least. (Just an attemt to make some money off of something that had a built in audience. An absurd mark on the series. As if we Halloween fans didn't know that what made the Halloween movies was the chemistry between Michael's evil and the psychological turmoil the benevolent Dr. Loomis was going through as he tried to stop Michael. HOW DARE SOMEONE NAME THOSE 2 FARCES HALLOWEEN!!!)  Onto the subject at hand. Part 5 certainly is different from the classic 1st chapter. But of course there are going to be some notable differences when a transition is made from the 70s into the 80s. (No disrespect towards Part 1 intended.) Part 5 starts with a quick flashback to the end of Part 4, which allows us to see how Michael survived yet again. We are then moved into the present. (A year later) Michael's niece, and Jamie Lee Curtis' daughter Jamie is going through psychological traumas, which interestingly give her some psychic abilities. (Alright) The movie then offers some time of normalicy, with some comic relief and foreshadowing of what is to come. I know some people knocked this movie for being more comical then the others, but I think this was actually a smart move. One weakness of Part 1 and 2 (in my opinion) was that many of Michael's victims were on the stiff 2d side. With the comical touches Part 5 adds, we get to know Michael's eventual victims and feel a little more sorry for them. Also, the presence of some comedy undelines the horror more. (Extremes can flatter each other if well done.) Another aspect of mystery is a cloaked man who seems to wander the scenes with no purpose, but in the very last moment we realize at least part of his purpose. The bulk of his purpose will be revealed in Part 6. (Curse of Michael Myers) I don't want to say too much and ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, but I think part 5 really had the best mixture of suspense, comic relief, and horror. The ending could NOT have been better if Michael and Dr. Loomis had written it themselves. It is in this 5th chapter that Dr. Loomis really shows his heroic side, his touching side, and his frustrated and determined side. SIDE NOTE: This chapter really shows the final and climactic battle between Dr. Loomis and Michael. To be sure, Dr. Loomis does have a significant part in the concluding 'Curse of Michael Myers.' However, Donald Pleasence's state of health at the time prevented him from having any direct confrontations with the simply evil Michael Myers. FINAL WORD: If you liked Parts 1, 2, and 4, be open to the fact that 5 is a little different. It is a great chapter and in my opinion, arguably the best.",4,Arguably the Best Halloween,1128470400,"10 5, 2005",2005,3209,"[""'ll"", 'begin', 'giving', 'brief', 'rundown', 'where', 'stand', '1st', 'Halloween', 'was', 'classic', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'seen', 'most', 'people', 'best', 'Part', '2', 'was', 'decent', 'watchable', 'movie', 'Part', '3', 'most', 'know', 'nothing', 'do', 'series', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'comment', 'did', 'kind', 'Part', '3', 'not', 'really', 'part', 'story', 'opinion', 'Part', '4', 'was', 'big', 'improvement', 'Looking', 'ahead', 'Part', '6', 'had', 'moments', 'Part', '6', 'wonderful', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'Loomis', 'gone', 'God', 'Rest', 'Soul', '2', 'movies', 'followed', 'were', 'pure', 'trash', 'say', 'least', 'Just', 'attemt', 'make', 'money', 'something', 'had', 'built', 'audience', 'absurd', 'mark', 'series', 'Halloween', 'fans', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'made', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'was', 'chemistry', 'Michael', 'evil', 'psychological', 'turmoil', 'benevolent', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'was', 'going', 'tried', 'stop', 'Michael', 'HOW', 'DARE', 'SOMEONE', 'NAME', 'THOSE', '2', 'FARCES', 'HALLOWEEN', 'subject', 'hand', 'Part', '5', 'certainly', 'different', 'classic', '1st', 'chapter', 'course', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'notable', 'differences', 'when', 'transition', 'made', '70s', '80s', 'disrespect', 'Part', '1', 'intended', 'Part', '5', 'starts', 'quick', 'flashback', 'end', 'Part', '4', 'see', 'how', 'Michael', 'survived', 'yet', 'again', 'are', 'then', 'moved', 'present', 'year', 'later', 'Michael', 'niece', 'Jamie', 'Lee', 'Curtis', 'daughter', 'Jamie', 'going', 'psychological', 'traumas', 'interestingly', 'give', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'Alright', 'movie', 'then', 'time', 'normalicy', 'comic', 'relief', 'foreshadowing', 'what', 'come', 'know', 'people', 'knocked', 'movie', 'being', 'more', 'comical', 'then', 'others', 'think', 'was', 'actually', 'smart', 'move', 'One', 'weakness', 'Part', '1', '2', 'opinion', 'was', 'many', 'Michael', 'victims', 'were', 'stiff', '2d', 'side', 'comical', 'touches', 'Part', '5', 'get', 'know', 'Michael', 'eventual', 'victims', 'feel', 'little', 'more', 'sorry', 'Also', 'presence', 'comedy', 'horror', 'more', 'Extremes', 'can', 'flatter', 'other', 'well', 'done', 'aspect', 'mystery', 'cloaked', 'man', 'who', 'wander', 'scenes', 'purpose', 'very', 'last', 'moment', 'realize', 'least', 'part', 'purpose', 'bulk', 'purpose', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'Part', '6', 'Curse', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'think', 'part', '5', 'really', 'had', 'best', 'mixture', 'suspense', 'comic', 'relief', 'horror', 'ending', 'could', 'NOT', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Michael', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'had', 'written', '5th', 'chapter', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'really', 'heroic', 'side', 'touching', 'side', 'frustrated', 'determined', 'side', 'SIDE', 'NOTE', 'chapter', 'really', 'final', 'climactic', 'battle', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Michael', 'be', 'sure', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'have', 'significant', 'part', 'concluding', ""'Curse"", 'Michael', 'Myers', 'However', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'state', 'health', 'time', 'prevented', 'having', 'direct', 'confrontations', 'simply', 'evil', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'FINAL', 'WORD', 'liked', 'Parts', '1', '2', '4', 'be', 'open', 'fact', '5', 'little', 'different', 'great', 'chapter', 'opinion', 'arguably', 'best']",Halloween 5 VHS

Danielle Harris again gives an  excellent performance as Jamie Lee Curtis' daughter, although I did think  the entire mute thing was stretching credibility just a bit. The two  self-described lousy cops added the perfect amount of humor, especially  with the goofy sound effects heard whenever they show up, until Michael  hacked 'em with a pitchfork.

255649,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,6301562925,Carl Manes,"[1, 2]","After the traumatic events that occurred last Halloween, Jamie Lloyd has been sent to live in a children's psychiatric clinic, but Dr. Loomis is convinced that the girl now possesses a psychic link to her murderous uncle. Loomis attempts to use young Jamie to bring Michael out in to the open for a final confrontation! HALLOWEEN 5 is the first major lull in the series. Although it uses many of the same devices from HALLOWEEN 4, they produce much lesser results. The character of Jamie that audiences had fallen in love with from before is now left psychic and mute, as if she had been ripped away from some poorly-scripted B-Movie. Michael's motives seem much more muddled here, as well. He is reduced to being just another faceless villain from any old Slasher film as he takes off after drunken, sex-crazed teenagers at a local party. The suspense is minimal, and the deaths provide little satisfaction or significance. Danielle Harris still succeeds despite the flaws that have now been written into her role, but Donald Pleasence is forced to call in a cold and considerably darker performance that seems unbefitting of his character. The one scene that truly stands out in this entry is shared between Michael and Jamie, where Michael momentarily forgets his murderous rage when confronted by his young niece. HALLOWEEN 5 points the series in a regrettable new direction that would continue to spin out of control in the next installment.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,Halloween 5,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1477,"['traumatic', 'events', 'occurred', 'last', 'Halloween', 'Jamie', 'Lloyd', 'been', 'sent', 'live', 'children', 'psychiatric', 'clinic', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'convinced', 'girl', 'now', 'psychic', 'link', 'murderous', 'uncle', 'Loomis', 'attempts', 'use', 'young', 'Jamie', 'bring', 'Michael', 'out', 'open', 'final', 'confrontation', 'HALLOWEEN', '5', 'first', 'major', 'lull', 'series', 'many', 'same', 'devices', 'HALLOWEEN', '4', 'produce', 'much', 'lesser', 'results', 'character', 'Jamie', 'audiences', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'now', 'left', 'psychic', 'mute', 'had', 'been', 'ripped', 'away', 'poorly-scripted', 'B-Movie', 'Michael', 'motives', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'muddled', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'reduced', 'being', 'just', 'faceless', 'villain', 'old', 'Slasher', 'film', 'off', 'drunken', 'sex-crazed', 'teenagers', 'local', 'party', 'suspense', 'minimal', 'deaths', 'provide', 'little', 'satisfaction', 'significance', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'still', 'flaws', 'have', 'now', 'been', 'written', 'role', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'forced', 'call', 'cold', 'considerably', 'darker', 'performance', 'unbefitting', 'character', 'one', 'scene', 'truly', 'out', 'entry', 'shared', 'Michael', 'Jamie', 'where', 'Michael', 'momentarily', 'murderous', 'rage', 'when', 'confronted', 'young', 'niece', '5', 'points', 'series', 'regrettable', 'new', 'direction', 'would', 'continue', 'spin', 'control', 'next', 'installment.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Halloween 5 VHS

After he had been shot up by Ben Meeker and Dr. Loomis, Michael fell into a shaft and swam away into the river, as the police blew up the mineshaft. Michael stumbled upon an old hermit. He tried to kill the hermit, but Michael was in so much pain from the bullet wounds, he just simply passes out.On October 30, 1989, one year later, JAMIE (again played by Danielle Harris) has been in a children's hospital to help her overcome the guilt for nearly killing Darlene Carruthers. Jamie has now lost control over her voice and is in a telepathic bond with her maddening uncle. She awakes from a nightmare and begins feeling MICHAEL MYERS (played by Donald L. Shanks) regaining consciousness after a year. He picks up his mask and kills the hermit that cared for him over the past year.The next morning is now Halloween. In Jamie's bedroom is RACHEL (again played by Ellie Cornell). DR. LOOMIS (again played by Donald Pleasance) peeks in to check on everything, making sure the girls are okay. Rachel and Jamie talk, until Rachel's girlfriend, TINA (played by Wendy Kaplin) appears at the window. Jamie is excited to see her. Rachel lets her in, where Rachel and Tina surprise Jamie with her costume for the Hospital Halloween Pageant. Jamie will be dressing as a princess. Dr. Loomis comes in to keep Rachel company as she walks out with Tina.Tina and Rachel walk home together, as Tina goes off to buy the outfits for the tower farm Halloween Party. Rachel decides to watch Tina's dog, Max.Rachel showers, as Max barks his head off. Rachel winds up wrapping up her shower to answer the phone. It's Dr. Loomis calling, since Jamie felt Michael lurking around the house. Max has run out the door. Loomis tells Rachel to run outside and go to the nearest neighbor. She runs out in her bath towel and gets help from her next-door neighbor. Everything is settled. Five minutes later, as Rachel is getting dressed, Max, who has returned, starts barking. A picture falls, sending Rachel to check it out. As she looks at a picture of Jamie, which is the picture that fell, Michael appears and kills Rachel.Jamie has another attack, as Dr. Loomis is back at the police station, talking to SHERIFF BEN MEEKER (again played by Beau Starr).Tina returns to Rachel's, but she figures Rachel may have gone out to the country with her parents. As she walks around Rachel's house, Tina's girlfriend, SAMANTHA (played by Tamara Glynn) arrives. They walk through the park, as Tina's boyfriend, MIKE (played by Jonathan Chapin) drives up. The Sam and Tina get into the car and drive down to the local mini-mart, where SPITZ (played by Matthew Walker) works. Spitz helps Mike steal a few cases of beer to bring to the Tower Farm Party. After Spitz leaves, Michael comes up to Mike's car and scratches it, causing Mike to have a confrontation with Michael. But Michael kills him off.The Halloween Pageant has arrived for the kids at the hospital. Jamie's little date is her friend, BILLY HILL (played by Jeffrey Landman), who is dressed as a pirate. As Jamie and Billy await their turn to show their costumes, Jamie gets another one of her feelings. Michael has showed up at Rachel's, where Tina is staying for the Halloween weekend. Michael is posing as Tina's boyfriend, Mike. They drive, until Tina stops to buy a pack of cigarettes, which is where Jamie actually screams, with the use of her voice. Dr. Loomis and the cops try to make out what Jamie is saying with the little use of her voice and find out where Tina is.Tina is brought in safely to the Hospital, where she's Jamie. Jamie stands up and actually calls out Tina's name, with full use of her voice. Tina hugs her, but realizes that Jamie has now gotten back the ability to speak, hugging her even tighter. Tina has to leave to get to the Tower Farm Party.She gets a ride from the two cops that came to Rachel's aid earlier in the film. She meets up with Sam and Spitz. The three head off into the barn next door to the party. Tina goes off, where Sam and Spitz have sex. But that is interrupted by Michael, when he kills them both. Tina finds them and begins screaming for help, when she sees Billy and Jamie running up. Michael appears in Mike's car and begins chasing Tina. Billy and Jamie scream for him to leave Tina alone, causing Michael to go after Jamie. The car crashes, Jamie falls and gets cut up badly, but is okay to walk. Michael gets out of the car unharmed and is about to kill Jamie, but Tina stops him, forcing Michael to kill Tina. Jamie screams after witnessing the murder of Tina. Dr. Loomis and Ben Meeker come to the kids' aid. Billy is taken back to the clinic, but Loomis needs Jamie's help, where he takes her to the first scene of the crime...The Myers House. The cops have the place surrounded, waiting for Michael to arrive, but Michael has arrived at the kid's hospital. Everybody leaves Loomis, Jamie, and OFFICER CHARLIE BLOCH (played by Troy Evans) at the house. Loomis is in the living room talking to Michael, but Michael knocks out Loomis and kills Charlie. Jamie runs away, until Loomis beats Michael down.Meeker has Michael locked up in a jail cell. Another cop takes Jamie to his car and is ready to drive her back to the hospital, but a strange man, dressed in black, shoots every cop inside to death and releases Michael.Think you can handle a fifth horrifying night?

Saxelid ""Bookworm""","[0, 0]","Let's see, we just had his Return, this is his Revenge, his Curse followed...for awhile it looked like the Halloween movies would be using the Pink Panther titles as sequel subheaders.  Thankfully we were all spared Trail of..., Son of..., and Strikes Again as titles.  For the record only Halloween 5 appears as the title on the film itself.After reinventing 4's cliffhanger ending, part 5 jumps from October 31, 1988 to October 31, 1989 (the year that this entry was made) and another set of victims to be in a town that really should just cancel the stupid holiday.  Myers again chases his sister's daughter all over town while the quite insane Dr. Loomis (this guy needs his license yanked, and pronto) moans and groans about evil and such.  While the script does attempt to develop its characters more than the average slasher flick would, it cannot overcome the far too many plot contrivances (such as having an elderly hermit keeping a comatose, bullet riddled man around his cabin for an entire year without calling for medical help or something) of the silly plot, perhaps the fault of the narrative concept concocted by series presenter Moutapha Akkad.  Mr. Akkad wanted annual Halloween movies, each year 'revealing' more pieces of the mystery behind the Myers rampage.  It didn't work, being all tease and no substance.Director Dominique Othenin-Girard does handle things well, packing in action and atmosphere.  The movie, while a tad longer than the average Halloween outing, is far from inert and boring.  It just isn't particularly suspenseful or scary.  Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasance do contribute good performances and composer Alan Howarth once again creates creepy riffs on Carpenter's classic themes.

Nothing good came out of this entry. What came was horrendous acting, ugly teens, and a music score that is a total embarassment.Michael apparently didn't die in the explosion at the end of #4, he escaped and traveled down a river instead.  A year later, Jamie is a mute (a bad decision because she's the only main character that does a decent job) and Dr. Loomis has been keeping a very close eye on little Jamie Llyod.  Racheal is going away for the weekend, but while she's packing, she dies.More teens with bland faces who are annoying as hell and don't have a personality you will remember 20 minutes after you view the film, Jamie finally talks with about 1/16th of the movie left to go.  Donald Pleasence is great as always, but the writing is so increadibly awful that he can only do so much to save this movie, and even the great Pleasence cannot save this movie from being a total disaster.  Don Shanks is also the worst actor to ever wear the horrific mask.  Praise God he did not return for #6.The bonus features on this DVD are quite good the audio commentary makes the movie slightly bearable, it's more entertaining than the movie will ever be.

Of course, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is still around and it's a good thing because the rest of the cast is just awful. Loomis has grown impatient though as he tries to convince Jamie to lead him to Michael. The killing spree starts up again and of course, Jamie and another seperate group of oversexed teenagers are the targets here.HALLOWEEN V has its moments as far as scares are concerned though it does work more at being gory than being scary at times.

255659,AODDKGNNV7AG2,6301562925,"Cult DVD Hunter ""Rico""","[1, 1]","I originally wanted to give this movie one less star, but then I watched it for the sake of this review and I take it back.  I think the hardest part about 4 and 5 is that they are interestingly similar but when you watch them side by side are quite different in their own respects.  Some of the scenes I thought I loved from Part 4 were actually in this movie!  This movie has its flaws, but I feel they may be more personal than actual.After creating a psychic link with Michael Meyers in the previous film (and nearly killing her mother) Jamie is left in a special children's hospital and unable to talk.  Michael ends up living the events of the last film and finds his way back to health just in time to attack Haddonfield when no one expects it, except of course, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence).  Now with Jamie unable to speak and with Michael hunting Jamie down but stopping along the way to kill people she cares about, will Jamie be able to protect the people she's endangered?This movie was very similar to the previous film in style and in the ""feel"" of the film.  What I like about this series is that it tends to live in two-part films, and this movie is definitely a great compliment to part 4.  All of the cast members come back and with the death of Rachel (Ellie Cornell) nearly in the beginning, it's clear that in this movie, all bets are off.  I must admit, I was incredibly hurt when Rachel died and I felt it was a flaw in the writing, but I think that's only because I liked her character so much and it does successfully establish that in this one, no one's safe.  The suspense from the last movie is still present, and in this movie it's almost amplified (especially with the last half an hour of the movie!) which still proved that Michael Meyers hasn't lost it.The DVD is again much better than most in the genre and in the series.  We get another widescreen cleaned up surround version of the movie.  The special features yet again give us an insight to the ""Jamie Saga"" of the Halloween series and it's great to watch Danielle Harris talk about what it was like to be 10 years old and play in a movie like this.  If you own Part 4 or if you're a fan of the series, you need to own this installment.  Also, if you weren't as big a fan of the first two and like more modern splatter films like Friday The 13th and Urban Legend (also starring Danielle Harris ironically) then you may want to rent 4 and 5 to see if they're up your alley.  No doubt about it, 4 & 5 are different from the rest of the series, to some that's a good thing and to others that's a very bad thing.",4,The Dynamic Is Kept But With A Couple Kinks,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,2599,"['originally', 'wanted', 'give', 'movie', 'one', 'less', 'star', 'then', 'watched', 'sake', 'review', 'take', 'back', 'think', 'hardest', 'part', '4', '5', 'are', 'interestingly', 'similar', 'when', 'watch', 'side', 'side', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'own', 'respects', 'scenes', 'thought', 'loved', 'Part', '4', 'were', 'actually', 'movie', 'movie', 'flaws', 'feel', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'personal', 'actual.After', 'creating', 'psychic', 'link', 'Michael', 'Meyers', 'previous', 'film', 'nearly', 'killing', 'mother', 'Jamie', 'left', 'special', 'children', 'hospital', 'unable', 'talk', 'Michael', 'up', 'living', 'events', 'last', 'film', 'way', 'back', 'health', 'just', 'time', 'attack', 'Haddonfield', 'when', 'one', 'course', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'Now', 'Jamie', 'unable', 'speak', 'Michael', 'hunting', 'Jamie', 'down', 'stopping', 'way', 'kill', 'people', 'will', 'Jamie', 'be', 'able', 'protect', 'people', 'endangered', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'similar', 'previous', 'film', 'style', 'feel', 'film', 'What', 'like', 'series', 'live', 'two-part', 'films', 'movie', 'definitely', 'great', 'compliment', 'part', '4', 'cast', 'members', 'come', 'back', 'death', 'Rachel', 'Ellie', 'Cornell', 'nearly', 'beginning', 'clear', 'movie', 'bets', 'are', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'incredibly', 'hurt', 'when', 'Rachel', 'died', 'felt', 'was', 'flaw', 'writing', 'think', 'only', 'liked', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'successfully', 'establish', 'one', 'one', 'safe', 'suspense', 'last', 'movie', 'still', 'present', 'movie', 'almost', 'amplified', 'especially', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'still', 'proved', 'Michael', 'Meyers', ""n't"", 'lost', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'again', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'genre', 'series', 'get', 'widescreen', 'cleaned', 'up', 'surround', 'version', 'movie', 'special', 'features', 'yet', 'again', 'give', 'insight', 'Jamie', 'Saga', 'Halloween', 'series', 'great', 'watch', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'talk', 'what', 'was', 'be', '10', 'years', 'old', 'play', 'movie', 'own', 'Part', '4', ""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'need', 'own', 'installment', 'Also', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'big', 'fan', 'first', 'two', 'more', 'modern', 'splatter', 'films', 'Friday', '13th', 'Urban', 'Legend', 'also', 'starring', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'ironically', 'then', 'may', 'want', 'rent', '4', '5', 'see', ""'re"", 'up', 'alley', 'doubt', '4', '5', 'are', 'different', 'rest', 'series', 'good', 'thing', 'others', 'very', 'bad', 'thing']",Halloween 5 VHS

255661,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6301562925,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","There are clearly a few problems with this movie, but I hardly noticed them at the time of its original release.  I left the theatre more excited about this movie than any horror movie I had yet seen.  The ending caught me totally by surprise and had my little circle of friends (all two of us) speculating over its implications for many days thereafter.  To say that this movie left things a little up in the air would be a misstatement of massive proportions.  Not only was I left to ponder the fate of Michael, Dr. Loomis, and little Jamie, I was mystified by ""the man in black.""  Who was he?  What was his role in all of this?  I still think the concluding 10 minutes of this movie are the best 10 minutes of the entire Halloween series, although I would not dare place this movie on the same pedestal as the original film, which is basically untouchable by all pretenders to the horror crown.I have nothing but the greatest respect for nine-year-old Danielle Harris.  The makers of Halloween 5 put this poor girl through the wringer, and she shines from start to finish in one of the most physical roles I have ever seen man, woman, or child play.  As the movie opens, she is living in a children's clinic, unable to talk since the shocking events of the previous Halloween night and increasingly prone to seizures and fits brought on by some kind of psychic connection with her uncle Michael.  Eventually, she finds herself running for her life as her uncle chases her down with a car and then his trusty knife.  Then toward the end comes the unforgettable scene in which she finds herself lodged in a laundry chute inside the abandoned Myers house desperately trying to stay alive.  The depth of emotion and sense of utter terror she is able to convey is really quite extraordinaryI have to admit I didn't particularly care for this incarnation of Michael.  No man can compare to the original Shape, Nick Castle, but the real problem for me in this movie is Michael's mask.  It just hangs loosely around his neck, and the sight of it flopping out on both sides like an extra pair of very large earlobes really kept me from seeing this masked killer as the Michael I know and love.  Donald Pleasance is, as usual, incredible as Dr. Loomis.  I admit, Loomis seems to be getting a little bit loony by this point in the series, but who can blame him?  Every time, he tells the authorities what is going to happen, yet no one ever believes him until it is too late.  Bearing the scars of previous encounters with Michael, his bravery and obsession with Michael Myers earns him five stars in my book every single time.Here are a few ""problems"" with this movie.  Let's start with the obvious.  What is wrong with the people in Haddonfield?  It is very important to keep in mind the fact that no body was ever found of a seemingly vanquished Michael after the events of the previous year.  Rachel, having barely lived through Halloween 4, not only leaves a spare key to her house on top of the doorframe, she leaves the door wide open while she is taking a shower.  Then there are these moronic teenagers consuming far too much of our time.  They insist on playing practical jokes on each other and even on the cops, finding the whole Boogeyman subject incredibly funny for some reason unknown to me.  It's hard not to cheer for Michael as he goes after these goofs.  Tina is incredibly immature, her boyfriend with the car fetish is unbearable, and her horny friends annoyed me as much as they apparently annoyed Michael.  Then we come to the cops.  Apparently, Michael's previous adventures have decimated the local police force because they are letting some incompetent people wear a badge these days.  Hearing some type of obvious clown music play when the two ""super cops"" first appear is basically unforgivable as far as I'm concerned.  Apparently, these two characters were supposed to supply some comic relief to a movie that needed nothing of the kind.Overall, I think this movie has moments of greatness that, for the most part, make up for its flaws.  Danielle Harris is amazing, and the final 10-15 minutes are riveting.  More than anything, though, I have to return to the fact that I left the movie theatre all those years ago totally excited about this movie and its mysterious twists and turns.  Any slasher movie that can inspire untold hours of speculation after the fact has achieved something quite rare indeed.",4,I knew that hell would not have him,1046476800,"03 1, 2003",2003,4430,"['are', 'clearly', 'few', 'problems', 'movie', 'hardly', 'noticed', 'time', 'original', 'release', 'left', 'theatre', 'more', 'excited', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'had', 'yet', 'seen', 'ending', 'caught', 'totally', 'surprise', 'had', 'little', 'circle', 'friends', 'two', 'speculating', 'over', 'implications', 'many', 'days', 'thereafter', 'say', 'movie', 'left', 'things', 'little', 'up', 'air', 'would', 'be', 'misstatement', 'massive', 'proportions', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'left', 'ponder', 'fate', 'Michael', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'little', 'Jamie', 'was', 'mystified', 'man', 'black', 'Who', 'was', 'What', 'was', 'role', 'still', 'think', 'concluding', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'best', '10', 'minutes', 'entire', 'Halloween', 'series', 'would', 'not', 'dare', 'place', 'movie', 'same', 'pedestal', 'original', 'film', 'basically', 'untouchable', 'pretenders', 'horror', 'crown.I', 'have', 'nothing', 'greatest', 'respect', 'nine-year-old', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'makers', 'Halloween', '5', 'put', 'poor', 'girl', 'wringer', 'start', 'finish', 'one', 'most', 'physical', 'roles', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'man', 'woman', 'child', 'play', 'movie', 'living', 'children', 'clinic', 'unable', 'talk', 'shocking', 'events', 'previous', 'Halloween', 'night', 'increasingly', 'prone', 'seizures', 'fits', 'brought', 'kind', 'psychic', 'connection', 'uncle', 'Michael', 'Eventually', 'running', 'life', 'uncle', 'down', 'car', 'then', 'trusty', 'knife', 'Then', 'end', 'unforgettable', 'scene', 'lodged', 'laundry', 'chute', 'abandoned', 'Myers', 'house', 'desperately', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'depth', 'emotion', 'sense', 'utter', 'terror', 'able', 'convey', 'really', 'quite', 'extraordinaryI', 'have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'incarnation', 'Michael', 'man', 'can', 'compare', 'original', 'Shape', 'Nick', 'Castle', 'real', 'problem', 'movie', 'Michael', 'mask', 'just', 'loosely', 'neck', 'sight', 'flopping', 'out', 'sides', 'extra', 'pair', 'very', 'large', 'earlobes', 'really', 'kept', 'seeing', 'masked', 'killer', 'Michael', 'know', 'love', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'usual', 'incredible', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'admit', 'Loomis', 'be', 'getting', 'little', 'bit', 'loony', 'point', 'series', 'who', 'can', 'blame', 'time', 'authorities', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'yet', 'one', 'ever', 'too', 'late', 'Bearing', 'scars', 'previous', 'encounters', 'Michael', 'bravery', 'obsession', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'five', 'stars', 'book', 'single', 'are', 'few', 'problems', 'movie', 'Let', 'start', 'obvious', 'What', 'wrong', 'people', 'Haddonfield', 'very', 'important', 'keep', 'mind', 'fact', 'body', 'was', 'ever', 'found', 'seemingly', 'vanquished', 'Michael', 'events', 'previous', 'year', 'Rachel', 'having', 'barely', 'lived', 'Halloween', '4', 'not', 'only', 'spare', 'key', 'house', 'top', 'doorframe', 'door', 'wide', 'open', 'taking', 'shower', 'Then', 'are', 'moronic', 'teenagers', 'consuming', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'insist', 'playing', 'practical', 'jokes', 'other', 'even', 'cops', 'finding', 'whole', 'Boogeyman', 'subject', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'reason', 'unknown', 'hard', 'not', 'cheer', 'Michael', 'goofs', 'Tina', 'incredibly', 'immature', 'boyfriend', 'car', 'fetish', 'unbearable', 'horny', 'annoyed', 'as', 'much', 'apparently', 'annoyed', 'Michael', 'Then', 'come', 'cops', 'Apparently', 'Michael', 'previous', 'adventures', 'have', 'decimated', 'local', 'police', 'force', 'are', 'letting', 'incompetent', 'people', 'wear', 'badge', 'days', 'Hearing', 'type', 'obvious', 'clown', 'music', 'play', 'when', 'two', 'super', 'cops', 'first', 'appear', 'basically', 'unforgivable', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Apparently', 'two', 'characters', 'were', 'supposed', 'supply', 'comic', 'relief', 'movie', 'needed', 'nothing', 'kind.Overall', 'think', 'movie', 'moments', 'greatness', 'most', 'part', 'make', 'up', 'flaws', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'amazing', 'final', '10-15', 'minutes', 'are', 'riveting', 'More', 'anything', 'have', 'return', 'fact', 'left', 'movie', 'years', 'ago', 'totally', 'excited', 'movie', 'mysterious', 'twists', 'turns', 'slasher', 'movie', 'can', 'inspire', 'untold', 'hours', 'speculation', 'fact', 'achieved', 'something', 'quite', 'rare', 'indeed']",Halloween 5 VHS

It is at this point that even horror fanatics begin to toy with the question- will HE ever die?  Still though the movie still holds many shocks and scares.  The movie continues straight after Halloween 4 in where Michael presumed dead after being knifed, shot several times, and falling into a mineshaft manages to escape just before the town nuke the place! Fortunately Michael having found refuge is taken in by a hermit.  But, one year later, as soon as he awakens he kills the hermit.  Myers continues to pursue his niece Jamie (Danielle Harris) and he'll do anything to get her.  Donald L.Shanks the man responsible for playing the monster does an excellent job at showing the brutality potential of Michael Myers.  Another element that proves original in the film is the introduction of the emotional Michael of where we discover that he must kill in order to stop the fury in his head.  We are also introduced to the DARKMAN of whom we know nothing about and of whom is more explained in the later sequel.  Halloween 5 pretty much follows it's predecessor in that the same themes are there- Michael hunting down his family members while madman Dr.Loomis plays the protector and the man responsible for possibly killing Myers. However, as with all Halloween films there are many holes such as Myer's house which seemed to have gone under a chrysallis formation.

255666,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,6301562925,Dave. K,"[7, 7]","This review is a little long, so please bare with me. There are also Spoilers.Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers is a movie that has the fans split in the middle. A lot of people see this as the downfall of the series, while others praise it as the last great Halloween movie. I have to admit Halloween 5 is a movie I like a lot more than I should and I sometimes think I like the movie for more what it could have been instead of what it is. The one thing I will say is Halloween 5 is probably the most flawed of the series.The script written by Michael Jacobs, Dominique Othenin-Girard & Shem Bitterman was rather weak and filled with numerous clich&eacute;s; John Carpenter & Debra Hill they aren't. While not the worst script ever written, Halloween 5 has a lot of great ideas that never quite seem to work as well as they should. Bottom line is Halloween 5 feels more like a first draft rather than final shooting script.They had some excellent ideas that if just re-worked a bit would have made Halloween 5 a very strong and solid movie despite being yet another sequel to long running franchises that dominated the 80s. I love when Loomis says, ""I prayed that he would burn in hell. But in my heart, I knew that hell would not have him."" That does show some decent writing right there, though it is very much Carpenter/Hill.The first half of the movie Jamie is a mute and she also has a psychic link with Michael Myers. While that may have turned off some fans I think it was actually a solid idea. Jamie is helpless and afraid, but the problem is when all is said and done the psychic link between the two never really seems to go anywhere. At the end of the day it didn't advance the plot. It seems the makers had some good ideas, but abandoned them along the way. Halloween 5 feels more like an early draft rather than final. Halloween 5 had some interesting ideas, but the execution wasn't really working well.Some problems with the movie are just simple little things. The opening scene was kind of idiotic, which apparently was re-shot with somebody else and not done by Dominique Othenin-Girard; why would the old hermit just keep Michael is his house for a whole year? It was obvious the guy was hurt and the way the scene plays out the hermit doesn't seem to know who Michael Myers is. Its things that like are what bring down Halloween 5.The hermit just lets Michael lay on the floor in a coma, logic would tell you to maybe go and get some help. The scene just really doesn't make any sense and bottom line is quite silly. The characters unlike the past Halloween movies are more of your standard slasher movie characters. One can argue so was the original, but that was the original the one that helped kick these movies into high gear.The characters lack the depth of some of the previous characters and seem to be there just to add to the body count. The one thing I did learn is the makers really must have liked Happy Days, since Mikey is obviously inspired by the Fonz. Tina is a character like the movie that fans love or hate; personally I liked Tina a lot. Ok, sure at times she was a bit annoying, but at the same time I found her quite likeable as well.The character of Sam had potential to be more than what she was, but she ends up being becoming the typical character in this type of movie, still she does the best she can and elevates the character just a bit. The one thing the makers did get right was the Loomis character; the guy is pretty much at a breaking point. We always knew he was obsessed with stopping Michael and here it shows even more. All the years and violence finally caught up to him and he's pretty much willing to do anything to stop Michael.Donald Pleasence is over the top at times, but that is exactly how the character is meant to be played. After the original Halloween, Loomis seemed to only be there since he was a fan favorite. Bottom line is he didn't really add much to the plot. But Halloween 5 actually does something with his character instead of standing around spitting out the same lines. Donald Pleasence is one of my very favorite actors. He can play a role straight, but also over the top when it's meant to be played that way.One of the biggest flaws is also the biggest asset for Halloween 5; The Myers house went from a normal sized house to a gothic like size mansion. Houses do not grow; I would have liked to have seen some kind of explanation on why the house is so big. Maybe someone was building there? May not be a great idea, but better than nothing.As a director Dominique Othenin-Girard fairs a bit better, while he isn't John Carpenter by any means he is able to put together some fairly decent scenes, but again the script really brings down the movie. While Dominique Othenin-Girard isn't a very good filmmaker he does show some signs of life. The pacing of Halloween 5 is very much mixed. There were too many scenes that take place is the daylight. While those scenes worked well in the original and were quite creepy they don't work quite as well here and some tension is lost due to that.As I said the pacing was very mixed; despite a running time of 95-minutes there were too many scenes that were a bit pointless and slow the pace down rather than moving it forward. The scene with Sammy and Tina, which seems to be outside the children's clinic where Jamie is, was just pointless. It didn't add anything to the movie and slowed down the pace. The introduction of Mikey could have been cut as well. In his next scene, which thankfully also happens to be his last would have served as a better intro and nothing plot wise would have been lost.Another debate with fans is the two cops who offer up the comedy relief. I actually did like the characters, but they did break up the tension. A lot of their scenes could have been edited out or edited down and even if only a few seconds here and there it would have greatly helped Halloween 5. That also brings me back to Tina, even though I did like her I will admit that at times she can be annoying in some spots. Editing would have helped there as well. Even if it was just one or two lines cut in some areas it would have taken away the more annoying scenes that Tina had.The prank Tina, Sam and Spitz play on the cops really could have been taken out as well. At this point in the movie the false scare really wasn't needed and plus it was fairly obvious it was a prank being pulled so due to that there was no suspense on the scene, which just makes it pointless. A lot of the scenes I brought up do greatly bring down the pacing; cutting those scenes wouldn't make Halloween 5 a classic of the genre, but I do think it would have made the movie a lot better.What so many people hate about Halloween 5 is what I love the most, and that's the death of Rachel. Now let me explain that. It's not that I didn't like the character, because I did. But killing off Rachel who was a major character in the previous so early on shows us anything is possible. Too many times the makers of these types of movies are afraid to take chances. They aren't willing to kill characters off because they are thinking about the next installment.Rachel was a great character, but her death also helped Halloween 5 in other ways as well. It made Jamie more vulnerable. I understand why so many fans were upset, but I felt it helped the movie in some ways. Of course the downside is we lost a great character, but like I said I liked her death early on because it showed nobody is safe.Director Dominique Othenin-Girard may not be a master of the horror genre, but he crafted several scenes that are the strongest of the series. The barn scene with Sam and Spitz was one of the more solid scenes in the movie. The barn scene does go on a bit too long and does drag in some spots, but it was also one of the more suspenseful moments of the movie. It had great tension and very creepy feel. It could have been trimmed down just a bit though.The car chase scene while a bit silly considering Michael really should have been able to run them down was a cool scene. It had some really great moments of suspense. Tina's death I thought was actually one of the finer moments in the sequels. She sacrifices herself for Jamie and Jamie watches as Michael stabs Tina. The way Michael holds Tina for a moment afterwards as she is dying and telling Jamie to run. Then Michael simply lays her down and turns his attention to Jamie. I think that scene was excellent and quite creepy.The final act to Halloween 5 was really strong as well. It was actually rather suspenseful and well-done. Again Dominique Othenin-Girard isn't what I would call a great director, but he does get some things right here and the chase scene in the final act he very much delivers. I still to this day feel the final act is a strong as any other final act in a horror movie. This is where the house being so big greatly adds to the movie; Having Michael chasing Jamie around was very creepy and very well done.Dominique Othenin-Girard and cinematographer Rob Draper do create a solid visual look. Halloween 5 isn't the most visually stunning movie I have ever seen, but it does look good. It has a European look much like the original Halloween did. Some people say Halloween 4 captured the style of the original. I have to disagree. Go back and watch Halloween 5. The look of the movie was very much crafted like the original Halloween.I think the mid-west look is captured but it's quite clear this movie was shot in the spring since the leaves are all green. But it's not a big deal since in the original we can see the fall look, but at times it's clear it's spring time. I do feel the night scenes had more of a fall look; spring nights can sometimes be cool out much like fall nights. So that wasn't so much the makers as it is mother nature.Another thing that has fans spilt is the man in black. Now you see this really was a double edged sword. Judging the man in black only in Halloween 5 and ignoring what he became it does add a great mystery to the movie. While, yes Halloween 5 is your typical stalk and slash movie the man in black gave it something a bit different. We have no idea who this guy is; he just appears out of nowhere. That added some mystery to the movie. But the problem was I really don't think there were many directions to take the character. I believe it was bound to be a letdown for fans.But judging it based only on Halloween 5 it was a solid mystery and the ending was a great cliffhanger and it was a shocking moment. The really funny thing though is how the man in black was able to take out the whole Haddonfield PD. Who was this guy really Jack Bauer?So that does show you the writers had some decent ideas, but again the script feels more like an early draft rather then a final draft. Halloween 5 clearly needed some more work done. Had the script been polished up in some areas I don't think it would be one of the all time greats, but the final product would have worked more. I'm not sure why there is so much hate for Halloween 5. In many ways it's your typical slasher movie that actually tries to be more than that. Halloween 5 has a solid plot, but gets lost due to the poor script. Halloween 5 has great music and a great villain and that helps elevate it over most slasher flicks released back in the 80sDespite all the flaws in Halloween 5 it also has some really strong points as well. It won't rate as one of my all time favorites, but I think it's a fun watch and a movie I like a lot more than I should.  Don't go in expecting anything like the original. Just watch it as a slasher movie and it works; not a perfect movie, but when all is said and done it's a fun movie.",4,A movie I like a lot more than I should,1189900800,"09 16,

After turning in brilliant performances in such noteworthy films as ""Halloween"" and, um, ""Halloween II,"" he finally got his due with ""Halloween 5."" Surely upon being told the news, he retired to his trailer and drank bourbon until he passed out.(I don't know if Donald Pleasence was really an alcoholic or not. But looking at him, I can't imagine him being anything else. He face looks genetically predisposed to being pressed against a barroom floor.)The posters for this movie called it ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers,"" but the onscreen title is simply ""Halloween 5,"" which is good, since Michael doesn't really get revenge on anybody in it. Kills some folks, sure, but they're mostly strangers, not people he had vendettas against. In fact, the two people he would have the most reason to kill -- Dr. Loomis and little Jamie -- are the two people he DOESN'T murder. ""Halloween 5: The Failure of Michael Myers"" would be more accurate, though admittedly not as appealing in a mass-marketing sense.After an opening credit sequence featuring a pumpkin being carved -- an act the filmmakers seemed to think we would find scary -- and after a few minutes of clips from ""Halloween 4,"" we are brought to the present day: Halloween Eve 1989. Even though Part 4 ended with Jamie -- the young niece of Michael Myers -- becoming evil and apparently the New Michael, now, a year later, she's just a disturbed child who can't talk (hooray!) and who's being kept in a home for creepy children. Why isn't Jamie evil after all? I dunno. Apparenly, Part 4 was only kidding about that.She does have a psychic connection with Uncle Mike, though, and can tell when people are in danger of him. Also, a lot of townspeople THINK she's evil, and they throw rocks through her window with notes attached to them that say, ""The evil child must die!"" Just add that to the pile of terrible, terrible things that happen to this girl in the interest of traumatizing her beyond the point of humanity. I would not be surprised if both the character and the actress who played her later turned to a career in pornography. In fact, I would be disappointed if they didn't. (The actress, Danielle Harris, did go on to appear in ""Urban Legends,"" which is sort of the same thing.)Jamie's foster parents are out of town this weekend, but she's safe and warm at the creepy children's hospital, under the disquieting care of half-melted Dr. Loomis (played by the aforementioned Mr. Pleasence). Loomis is pretty frustrated with the fact that Jamie can't talk and help him find Michael; how he knows Michael is even still alive is beyond me, since Michael died at the end of Part 4.Michael is still alive, of course; he swam down a river and then stumbled into a shack belonging to an old man, whom he killed (but not before taking a nap). It is unclear when this takes place. We see him escaping the mine shaft he fell into at the end of Part 4, and we see him swimming down a river. Then he enters the shack and passes out, exhausted from the chase. This all happened moments after the events of Part 4, right? Right, except that then it's a year later and Jamie's in the hospital having psychic connections with Michael ... who is still in the shack, where no time seems to have elapsed. The shack exists in a wormhole, apparently, the Shack That Time Forgot.Anyhoo, somehow Dr. Loomis figures out Michael must still be alive -- probably all the freaking out Jamie does clues him in -- and wants to catch him, and the police cooperate but are really, really stupid and do more harm than good, adding more weight to the argument that we shouldn't even HAVE police in this country.Jamie's foster sister Rachel, left over from the last movie, gets killed before long by Michael Myers, who doesn't even bother hiding anymore. He pretty much just stands around where anyone could see him, often in broad daylight, and yet no one sees him. You'd think a town that had been victimized just a year earlier by a Halloween-themed serial killer would be more alert on the anniversary of it. You'd especially think Rachel would be on her toes and not in the shower all the time, considering she was one of Michael's primary targets last year. But who am I to judge? No one's ever tried to kill me with a knife. Maybe I'd pretend it never happened, too.Anyway, Rachel gets killed, which is fine with me, but her replacement as heroine is her annoying `80s friend Tina, a bedenimed vixen with a loathsome boyfriend and an even loathsomer fashion sense. Because she is the most irritating person on the face of the earth, in the perverse sense of justice employed by these movies, she is destined to live until the movie is almost over.Michael seems to have killing Jamie as his goal, but he is easily distracted from it. He comes upon a Halloween party attended by randy teens (""Friday the 13th"" was on its Part 8 by now; the ""Halloween"" folks obviously had been watching and taking notes), where he decides he ought to kill all of them, all of them, I tell you! How he thinks this will help him kill Jamie, I don't know. Maybe he's just practicing. At any rate, a really blond couple, including a nearly bald teen-age boy, is having sex -- he with his pants on and not even unzipped, don't ask me how -- when Michael skewers them with a pitchfork. You like to see that happen. I do, anyway.Loomis has it in his head that if Michael kills Jamie, his ""rage"" will be quieted, and he'll stop killing. So he uses the poor girl as bait, back at Michael's childhood home, which has grown into a Victorian mansion. The question is whether she is just bait to lure Michael there so they can kill him, or whether the insane Loomis actually plans to deliver her up to her murderous uncle. There are hints of good filmmaking in all that.Another hint of quality comes with a mysterious dark figure who lurks around the movie and in the end busts Michael out of jail. It is merely a hint, though, as it is not resolved in this film, and it is patently unfair to introduce such major plot points solely for the purpose of setting up a sequel.",3,Halloween 5: The

255670,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,6301562925,David Girod,"[1, 2]","I love horror movies, love 'em. Horror is my favorite genre, and I have a particular love for 80's slasher flicks. I grew up on these films, and drop everything, even today, when a new entry in either the ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series comes out. I love 'em, and can usually find something to enjoy even in the weakest entries.With that said, I HATE this movie. Even sticking within the movie's logic, Halloween 5 is a dumb movie that insults fans of the series and anyone watching this film.Taking up one year after the events of the previous film, we learn that Michael escpaed the raging rednecks by sneaking out of a hole in the back of the mine he was blown into. He scootches out into a river and rides the rapids downstream to an old hermit's shanty. The old hermit, who obviously hasn't heard about the raging maniac stalking Haddonfield, decides to keep a horribly wounded masked man in his shack instead of calling the police or taking him for medical assistance??!?! One year goes by and Michael awakens, and the killing spree begins.We learn that Jamie is in a children's clinic and has been rendered mute due to the events of the last film. Rachel makes what amounts to an extended cameo, and seems to have moved along quite nicely from the horrific events of the previous year. She's made annoying new friends, and dear god are they annoying, and she's planning on hosting a Halloween bash at her house with her folks being out of town.We also learn that Jamie now has a psychic connection to Michael...um, okay? And we also see that a mysterious Man in Black has arrived in Haddonfield. Why, who is he? We won't know for another film, so just disregard his presence. Dr. Loomis seems to know that Michael is coming back, and tries to prepare everyone...again, but before long Michael is back slashing his way through party goers and goofy deputies.This movie misfires on almost all counts; saddling us with Rachel's annoying friends, adding way too much plot and motive for Michael, and giving Donald Pleasence and Danielle Harris so little to work with. During one long stretch of film, Michael even gets rid of his iconic white mask in favor of a thug mask, then proceeds to drive around for a big chunk of the film. I prefer Michael walking and stalking, not cruising around in a muscle car.Unfortunately, if you've invested the time in part 4, and have any plan on watching part 6...then you're stuck having to endure this entry. It's not scary, not gory, not funny....and outside of the presence of Donald Pleasence, I can't think of a thing to recommend about this movie.",1,Booooo.......,1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,2655,"['love', 'horror', 'movies', 'love', 'Horror', 'favorite', 'genre', 'have', 'particular', 'love', '80', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'grew', 'up', 'films', 'drop', 'everything', 'even', 'today', 'when', 'new', 'entry', 'Halloween', 'Friday', '13th', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'series', 'out', 'love', 'can', 'usually', 'find', 'something', 'enjoy', 'even', 'weakest', 'entries.With', 'said', 'HATE', 'movie', 'Even', 'sticking', 'movie', 'logic', 'Halloween', '5', 'dumb', 'movie', 'insults', 'fans', 'series', 'anyone', 'watching', 'film.Taking', 'up', 'one', 'year', 'events', 'previous', 'film', 'learn', 'Michael', 'escpaed', 'raging', 'rednecks', 'sneaking', 'hole', 'back', 'mine', 'was', 'blown', 'out', 'river', 'rapids', 'downstream', 'old', 'hermit', 'shanty', 'old', 'hermit', 'who', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'heard', 'raging', 'maniac', 'stalking', 'Haddonfield', 'keep', 'horribly', 'wounded', 'masked', 'man', 'shack', 'instead', 'calling', 'police', 'taking', 'medical', 'assistance', 'One', 'year', 'Michael', 'awakens', 'killing', 'spree', 'begins.We', 'learn', 'Jamie', 'children', 'clinic', 'been', 'rendered', 'mute', 'due', 'events', 'last', 'film', 'Rachel', 'what', 'amounts', 'extended', 'cameo', 'have', 'moved', 'quite', 'nicely', 'horrific', 'events', 'previous', 'year', 'made', 'annoying', 'new', 'friends', 'dear', 'god', 'are', 'annoying', 'planning', 'hosting', 'Halloween', 'bash', 'house', 'folks', 'being', 'town.We', 'also', 'learn', 'Jamie', 'now', 'psychic', 'connection', 'Michael', 'um', 'okay', 'also', 'see', 'mysterious', 'Man', 'Black', 'arrived', 'Haddonfield', 'Why', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'so', 'just', 'disregard', 'presence', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'know', 'Michael', 'coming', 'back', 'tries', 'prepare', 'everyone', 'again', 'long', 'Michael', 'back', 'slashing', 'way', 'party', 'goers', 'goofy', 'deputies.This', 'movie', 'misfires', 'almost', 'counts', 'saddling', 'Rachel', 'annoying', 'friends', 'adding', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'motive', 'Michael', 'giving', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'so', 'little', 'work', 'one', 'long', 'stretch', 'film', 'Michael', 'even', 'rid', 'iconic', 'white', 'mask', 'favor', 'thug', 'mask', 'then', 'drive', 'around', 'big', 'chunk', 'film', 'prefer', 'Michael', 'walking', 'stalking', 'not', 'cruising', 'around', 'muscle', 'car.Unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'invested', 'time', 'part', '4', 'have', 'plan', 'watching', 'part', '6', 'then', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'having', 'endure', 'entry', 'not', 'scary', 'not', 'gory', 'not', 'funny', '.and', 'presence', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'thing', 'recommend', 'movie']",Halloween 5 VHS

Too many distracting characters stick out throughout the story. I blame this on the director. Tina was emphasized as being a dingy airhead to the point that she certainly could not have had two brain cells to click together. She kinda forgets she was just talking to Rachel earlier about a party, and chalks her disappearance up to ""I guess she decided to go to the lake with her parents after all."" (Ok? Did she walk there airhead?) Tina's boyfriend was emphasized as being ""Joe Cool"" way, way too much - buffs the car at every free opportunity, and has zero patience with anyone (except for Tina, because she puts out for him). The director makes damn sure we know that Tina puts out, just in case we are too stupid to figure this out on our own. Guess we know what she uses that one brain cell for. Sammy's (a super hot girl) boyfriend acts way too gay to have any possible interest in her. Guess he mistook her for a guy because of her name? We know we have a couple of bozo cops on our hands when the silly music plays even before we get a word out of their mouths. Jamie is a cute little girl, but she was way too annoying with her whining towards the end of the movie. Without Laurie Strode, Halloween is about Michael Myers and what he will do next. We do have Dr. Loomis and his eerie way of expaining why Michael is pure evil, which was a plus. Halloween 5 picks up a year after Halloween 4. But going from Halloween 4 to 5, we have a different director, writer and producer and it shows! There are some strange loop holes. Are we to believe Michael escaped at the end of H4, passed out in the strangers cabin, and woke up one year later? He must have, because Michael immediately shows his gratitude by killing the stranger who took him in. An by the way, didn't the kindly stranger notice all the shotgun holes in Michael? Rachel disappears too soon from the story.

255680,A2F7PEA3G37YDT,6301562925,dylan21484nj,"[3, 5]","The title of the film seems rather nonsensical. Who is Michael Myers getting revenge on? The people who tried to kill him? Michael's target is still his niece, and she didn't really do anything to him aside from running away and screaming. Is he getting revenge on the police who gunned him down? Then why doesn't he target them instead of picking off horny teenagers? Not only is the title bad, but the slug line is dumb too. ""Michael lives. And this time, they're ready!"" No, they're not! Everyone but Dr. Loomis and Jamie act like Michael is dead and gone, even as people get picked off one by one. And when the cops finally hatch a plan to catch him late in the film, Michael outsmarts them!Halloween 4 brought back the unkillable masked murderer Michael Myers, and the fans responded by making The Return of Michael Myers a huge success. So the producers, Trancas International, decided to strike again while the iron was still hot, and Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers quickly went into production.Released in 1989, a year after Halloween 4's release, Halloween 5 picks up a year after the the events of the previous film. Michael Myers was left for dead, and his niece Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) has seemingly taken on the evil force that possessed Michael. But rather than run with the premise of a little girl as an evil killer, Halloween 5 takes a different route. We find out that Jamie has spent the last year in Haddonfield's Children's Hospital, unable to speak and plagued with telepathic visions of her uncle. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) believes that Michael is still alive and that Jamie's visions will lead him and the police to Michael so they can kill him once and for all.And where has Michael been all this time? Why, comatose in a hermit's cabin, of course! Yes, really. Did the hermit feed him all this time? Does Michael even need to eat at all? And wouldn't even a hermit do something with an unconscious body, be it let the cops know, abandon the body somewhere, or even bury it? And what happened with Michael's mask? It has completely changed from the mask he wore in Halloween 4. Did they even try to make a similar mask? Doesn't look like they even bothered.Unfortunately, Jamie's adopted sister and protector, Rachel (Ellie Cornell) is dealt with very early in this film, and Halloween 5 introduces us to a fresh crop of fun-seeking teens for Michael to slaughter. Unlike Halloween 4's love triangle involving Rachel, Brady, and Kelly, these kids have little to do with the actual story. We meet Tina (Wendy Kaplan), an incredibly annoying party girl and Rachel's friend, who almost takes up the role as Jamie's protector, but it's never really all that believable since she's merely a friend instead of a relative, and spends most of the movie acting like life is a neverending party, totally oblivious to the threat to Jamie's life. Her character never comes off as sympathetic either, since Tina's character type is always the one who seems to get killed first in these movies, so the audience finds themselves begging Michael to kill her just to be rid of her. We also meet Tina's friends whose names aren't even all that important since their deaths come of little consequence to anyone. They're merely there to give Michael someone to slice and dice.We're also introduced to a mysterious Man in Black, and no it isn't Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones. The Man in Black possesses the same strange triangular symbol on his wrist that Michael does and he seems to have an interest in the killer, but his connection to Michael is never truly explored until the following movie. The film ends on a cliffhanger, but it's nowhere near as shocking as Halloween 4's ending.You get the sense that the script could have used more than a few rewrites and a more inspired choice for director than Dominique Othenin-Gerard. He doesn't seem to know how to build suspense or atmosphere, just seemingly bouncing from kill to kill without any reason to care about those in Michael's crosshairs. For these reasons, Halloween 5: The Revenge of MIchael Myers is easily one of the worst in the franchise.",2,"Terrible installment, one of the worst in the franchise!",1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,4132,"['title', 'film', 'rather', 'nonsensical', 'Who', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'getting', 'revenge', 'people', 'who', 'tried', 'kill', 'Michael', 'target', 'still', 'niece', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'aside', 'running', 'away', 'screaming', 'getting', 'revenge', 'police', 'who', 'gunned', 'down', 'Then', 'why', ""n't"", 'target', 'instead', 'picking', 'off', 'horny', 'teenagers', 'Not', 'only', 'title', 'bad', 'slug', 'line', 'dumb', 'too', 'Michael', 'time', ""'re"", 'ready', 'No', ""'re"", 'not', 'Everyone', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Jamie', 'act', 'Michael', 'dead', 'gone', 'even', 'people', 'get', 'picked', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'when', 'cops', 'finally', 'hatch', 'plan', 'catch', 'late', 'film', 'Michael', '4', 'brought', 'back', 'unkillable', 'masked', 'murderer', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'fans', 'responded', 'making', 'Return', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'huge', 'success', 'producers', 'Trancas', 'International', 'decided', 'strike', 'again', 'iron', 'was', 'still', 'hot', 'Halloween', '5', 'Revenge', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'quickly', 'went', 'production.Released', '1989', 'year', 'Halloween', '4', 'release', 'Halloween', '5', 'up', 'year', 'events', 'previous', 'film', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'was', 'left', 'dead', 'niece', 'Jamie', 'Lloyd', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'seemingly', 'taken', 'evil', 'force', 'possessed', 'Michael', 'rather', 'run', 'premise', 'little', 'girl', 'evil', 'killer', 'Halloween', '5', 'different', 'route', 'find', 'out', 'Jamie', 'spent', 'last', 'year', 'Haddonfield', 'Children', 'Hospital', 'unable', 'speak', 'plagued', 'telepathic', 'visions', 'uncle', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'Michael', 'still', 'alive', 'Jamie', 'visions', 'will', 'lead', 'police', 'Michael', 'can', 'kill', 'once', 'all.And', 'where', 'Michael', 'been', 'time', 'Why', 'comatose', 'hermit', 'cabin', 'course', 'Yes', 'really', 'Did', 'hermit', 'feed', 'time', 'Michael', 'even', 'need', 'eat', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'hermit', 'do', 'something', 'unconscious', 'body', 'be', 'let', 'cops', 'know', 'abandon', 'body', 'somewhere', 'even', 'bury', 'what', 'happened', 'Michael', 'mask', 'completely', 'changed', 'mask', 'wore', 'Halloween', '4', 'Did', 'even', 'try', 'make', 'similar', 'mask', ""n't"", 'look', 'even', 'bothered.Unfortunately', 'Jamie', 'adopted', 'sister', 'protector', 'Rachel', 'Ellie', 'Cornell', 'dealt', 'very', 'early', 'film', 'Halloween', '5', 'introduces', 'fresh', 'crop', 'fun-seeking', 'teens', 'Michael', 'slaughter', 'Halloween', '4', 'love', 'triangle', 'involving', 'Rachel', 'Brady', 'Kelly', 'kids', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'actual', 'story', 'meet', 'Tina', 'Wendy', 'Kaplan', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'party', 'girl', 'Rachel', 'friend', 'who', 'almost', 'up', 'role', 'Jamie', 'protector', 'never', 'really', 'believable', 'merely', 'friend', 'instead', 'relative', 'most', 'movie', 'acting', 'life', 'neverending', 'party', 'totally', 'oblivious', 'threat', 'Jamie', 'life', 'character', 'never', 'off', 'sympathetic', 'Tina', 'character', 'type', 'always', 'one', 'who', 'get', 'killed', 'first', 'movies', 'audience', 'begging', 'Michael', 'kill', 'just', 'be', 'rid', 'also', 'meet', 'Tina', 'friends', 'names', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'important', 'deaths', 'come', 'little', 'consequence', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'merely', 'there', 'give', 'Michael', 'someone', 'slice', 'dice.We', ""'re"", 'also', 'introduced', 'mysterious', 'Man', 'Black', ""n't"", 'Will', 'Smith', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Man', 'Black', 'same', 'strange', 'triangular', 'symbol', 'wrist', 'Michael', 'have', 'interest', 'killer', 'connection', 'Michael', 'never', 'truly', 'explored', 'following', 'movie', 'film', 'cliffhanger', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'shocking', 'Halloween', '4', 'ending.You', 'get', 'sense', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'few', 'rewrites', 'more', 'inspired', 'choice', 'director', 'Dominique', 'Othenin-Gerard', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'build', 'suspense', 'atmosphere', 'just', 'seemingly', 'bouncing', 'kill', 'kill', 'reason', 'care', 'Michael', 'crosshairs', 'reasons', 'Halloween', '5', 'Revenge', 'MIchael', 'Myers', 'easily', 'one', 'worst', 'franchise']",Halloween 5 VHS

It contained the hallmark frightening trademarks including the eerie Halloween music.  The opening was great and it made a decent conclusion to its predecessor Halloween 4.However, there are a few notes of concern (which is why I rated this movie a four).  The biggest problem of all, was the end didn't really end.  I know this is common in many horror movies but this ending really really sucked.  It was almost like they were trying to give Michael Meyers a killing buddy.  Something  like a chopping and dicing duo.  Although for those who have seen the sequels following this one, you realize they really never ever explained the mysterious man or why he was ever even in the movie.  He just blows up the police station and frees Michael Meyers.  If you are going to bring in some off the wall.....(insert appropriate metaphor here), then at least bring it to conclusion in one of your sequels.If you are a true horror fan then by all means purchase this for your library.

255682,ADWQPR0LJD4J,6301562925,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[3, 4]","Everything ""Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers"" accomplished by bringing back the masked knife-wielding maniac with an injection of Hitchcockian suspense was demolished by the fifth installment in the franchise. ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" is a sad attempt at taking the back story of the killer and expanding upon it. This movie is the perfect example of producers and screenwriters trying to make more out of something than is possible. Anchor Bay's release of the film on Blu-ray gives fans a chance to revisit it and scratch their head in bewilderment at the ridiculous subplot alluded to.A year has passed since Michael Myer's (Don Shanks) young niece Jamie (Danielle Harris) mentally broke down after being stalked by the killer. The attack on her step-mother leads to her admittance into a children's psychiatric hospital. Michael survived the mine collapse and shares a psychic link with Jamie. Now mute, she must find a way to communicate her painful visions to her step-sister (Ellie Cornell) and Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance). Meanwhile, a strange man arrives in Haddonfield with sinister intentions for Myers.Where part four showed very little, this fifth installment went the other direction and featured Myers visually stabbing his victims with pitchforks, his hands, and butcher knives. Director Dominique Othenin-Girard leaves nothing to the imagination. Besides subtle nuances like the psychic connection between Michael and his niece Jamie and the unnecessary attempt at a subplot with the stranger in black, this is a generic slasher film through and through.Danielle Harris is perfect as the mute Jamie. She thrashes around and cries without making sounds. She is completely convincing in the role. Donald Pleasance delivers a stellar performance in a movie that really doesn't justify his effort. He could've just walked through this one and been better than any of his co-stars minus Harris.What the movie lacks in content quality it makes up for with its superb high-definition audio and video presentation. The picture is clean and vibrant and the 5.1 surround sound enhances the experience with a familiar mix of John Carpenter's signature musical score, the screams of Michael's victims, and the sounds of slashing and crashing.There are enough special features included to get hardcore ""Halloween"" fans excited. Two separate audio commentaries with actors Don Shanks, Danielle Harris, and Jeffrey Landham and director Dominique Othenin-Girard and author Justin Beahm give insight into the making of the film. A featurette entitled ""'Halloween 5:' On the Set"" is also found. There's a theatrical trailer and original promo as well.The new ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" Blu-ray release spotlights one of the weaker entries in the franchise. It's mildly entertaining and still has excellent performances by Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasance which need to be seen. Just don't expect a repeat of part four's quality going into it and you'll be alright. Fans and completists will find it necessary to pick up this chapter of the Michael Myers' saga immediately.",3,"Blu-ray Review: ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers""",1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,3121,"['Everything', 'Halloween', '4', 'Return', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'accomplished', 'bringing', 'back', 'masked', 'knife-wielding', 'maniac', 'injection', 'Hitchcockian', 'suspense', 'was', 'demolished', 'fifth', 'installment', 'franchise', 'Halloween', '5', 'Revenge', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'sad', 'attempt', 'taking', 'back', 'story', 'killer', 'expanding', 'movie', 'perfect', 'example', 'producers', 'screenwriters', 'trying', 'make', 'more', 'something', 'possible', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'release', 'film', 'Blu-ray', 'fans', 'chance', 'revisit', 'scratch', 'head', 'bewilderment', 'ridiculous', 'subplot', 'alluded', 'to.A', 'year', 'passed', 'Michael', 'Myer', 'Don', 'Shanks', 'young', 'niece', 'Jamie', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'mentally', 'broke', 'down', 'being', 'stalked', 'killer', 'attack', 'step-mother', 'leads', 'admittance', 'children', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'Michael', 'survived', 'mine', 'collapse', 'shares', 'psychic', 'link', 'Jamie', 'Now', 'mute', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'communicate', 'painful', 'visions', 'step-sister', 'Ellie', 'Cornell', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'Meanwhile', 'strange', 'man', 'Haddonfield', 'sinister', 'intentions', 'Myers.Where', 'part', 'four', 'showed', 'very', 'little', 'fifth', 'installment', 'went', 'other', 'direction', 'featured', 'Myers', 'visually', 'stabbing', 'victims', 'pitchforks', 'hands', 'knives', 'Director', 'Dominique', 'Othenin-Girard', 'nothing', 'imagination', 'Besides', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'psychic', 'connection', 'Michael', 'niece', 'Jamie', 'unnecessary', 'attempt', 'subplot', 'stranger', 'black', 'generic', 'slasher', 'film', 'through.Danielle', 'Harris', 'perfect', 'mute', 'Jamie', 'around', 'cries', 'making', 'sounds', 'completely', 'convincing', 'role', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'stellar', 'performance', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'justify', 'effort', 'could', ""'ve"", 'just', 'walked', 'one', 'been', 'better', 'co-stars', 'minus', 'Harris.What', 'movie', 'content', 'quality', 'up', 'superb', 'high-definition', 'audio', 'video', 'presentation', 'picture', 'clean', 'vibrant', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'experience', 'familiar', 'mix', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'signature', 'musical', 'score', 'screams', 'Michael', 'victims', 'sounds', 'slashing', 'crashing.There', 'are', 'enough', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'get', 'hardcore', 'Halloween', 'fans', 'excited', 'Two', 'separate', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'actors', 'Don', 'Shanks', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'Jeffrey', 'Landham', 'director', 'Dominique', 'Othenin-Girard', 'author', 'Justin', 'Beahm', 'give', 'insight', 'making', 'film', 'featurette', 'entitled', ""'Halloween"", '5', 'Set', 'also', 'found', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'original', 'promo', 'well.The', 'new', 'Halloween', '5', 'Revenge', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'spotlights', 'one', 'weaker', 'entries', 'franchise', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'still', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'need', 'be', 'seen', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'repeat', 'part', 'four', 'quality', 'going', ""'ll"", 'be', 'alright', 'Fans', 'completists', 'will', 'find', 'necessary', 'pick', 'up', 'chapter', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'saga', 'immediately']",Halloween 5 VHS

255686,A3BMZYA7CT2E74,6301562925,G. Garner,"[4, 5]","This film is one of my absolute favorites from any genre. Like most sequels, it is simply a variation on the themes of the original. The Bogeyman stalks his victims, and Dr. Loomis stalks him, resulting in a 'triangular' hunt, of sorts. Of course, all of this is set against the backdrop of Halloween. What I find particularly appealing about this movie is that it fits comfortably within the confines of the series, yet still manages to be distinctive, as well. It is possessed of an aura that sets it apart from the other Halloween movies. However, it is still powerfully anchored to the essential elements of the original.Perhaps my favorite dimension is the triangular hunt to which I have already alluded. For me, what sets Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis apart from typical villains and heroes is that neither of them derive their motivation from conventional human agendas.Myers, for example, is not driven to evil by any petty human frailty. He lives out what he is, and each action is its own reward. The same is true of Loomis. He knows, all too well, that, come what may, he has nothing to gain by stalking his patient. He has seen enough of Haddonfield to know that, no matter how much he may sacrifice, the best he can expect is to be misunderstood. He perseveres, knowing that he is risking his life for people who will never appreciate him, because this is who he is.Myers and Loomis share a bond that has been forged within the confines of the shadows.After all, the local police would suffice if all you wanted to do was to catch a shoplifter or routine hoodlum. But to combat the Bogeyman, a creature of the shadows, you need a hero who is equally at home in those solitary, dark places.Halloween 5 makes use of the same devices that you find in the other films. The extensive cat-and-mouse scenarios, for example, with Michael Myers always just on the perimeter of the primary action.The part, early on, when he patiently stalks Rachel in her house, is effective. But my favorite sequence of this type happens later in the film, when the kids are in the old barn. This is perfectly lit, and perfectly paced, with Myers displaying all the patience of a master hunter as he silently watches his prospective victims. Once he does decide to act, the culmination is immediate and brutal. The barn sequence is one of my favorite scenes in any slasher movie.The last half of Halloween 5 contains several of the greatest moments in the series.The car chase through the field, and the tragic death of Tina. Tina had her idiosynchrasies, but she did, ultimately, give her life for the little girl. This lends her death an emotional resonance that one does not ordinarily find in a slasher film.The final major segment, at the Myers' house, is incredible. The part where Jamie gets trapped in the laundry chute, with Michael Myers standing right beside it, is as suspenseful as anything dating back to the first film. The little girl frantically tries to scratch and claw her way back up the chute to safety-struggling with all her might to get a foothold, or some sort of traction-and, all the while, the hulking figure of the Bogeyman is only inches away, hacking furiously through the thin metal with his huge butcher knife. It is an inspired moment.And, as always, Loomis rises to the occasion yet again. He overcomes the effects of a terrible knife wound to do battle with Myers once more.Considering his age, and the circumstances, and the fact that he takes the Bogeyman down with brute force this time-it may well be Dr. Loomis' finest hour.There are other strong elements to be found here. The cinematography is beautiful and imaginative. There are lots of great shots where the murky darkness of the backdrops are offset perfectly by the bright crimson tones of the girls' costumes.Little Jamie's costume is used to even more vivid effect. It is possessed of a luster that makes her seem like a little sparkling amethyst cloaked in the darkness of night. The music is effective. There is a particularly nice touch at the point, about halfway through the film, where Loomis enters the Myers house. If you listen closely, you can hear gentle strains of the same music that was played when Loomis entered the Myers house in the original 'Halloween.' It adds a little nostalgic touch to the proceedings.On a more superficial note, I don't know when I've seen three such gorgeous women assembled in one movie. Rachel and Tina make a nice contrast, with Rachel being the ideal girl-next-door type, and Tina being somewhat more exotic looking.Which brings us to Sami. If I had to list the five best looking women I've ever seen, Sami would be on the list. She is a goddess.There has been a lot of criticism directed at the more controversial aspects of this movie. The man in black,for example, or the two dumb cops. While I could certainly do without these characters(especially the cops) their presense is kept to a minimum. Out of an hour and forty minute movie, they are only onscreen for a couple of minutes. Some have been critical of the way that the Myers house has been transformed, or the way that Michael's mask looks. I simply look upon these things as this particular director's interpretation. At the end of the day, such inconsistencies have popped up throughout the series. They are no more severe in this edition than in any of the other Halloween films.People often speak of having seen a movie 'hundreds' of times. Of course, I don't know how often they are exxagerating. For myself, there are only four movies that I have seen into the triple digits, and they all have 'Halloween' in the title(1,2,4,and 5.)These movies monopolize my imagination like nothing ever has. In this case, the special features are reasonably good, as well. I loved this movie from the first time I saw it, and I appreciate it more with the passage of time.",5,One of my favorite films,1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,5861,"['film', 'one', 'absolute',

Picking up exactly where Halloween 4 left off, we see that Myers actually survived being shot 50 times by the state police. Evidently, some idiot takes Myers in and nurses him back to health, and of course, Myers rudely thanks him by killing him just before he goes on another Halloween murderous rampage.The biggest problem I have with this film is the mess they made of Michael Myers. There is no possible way to reconcile the behavior patterns of Michael Myers in Part 5 with the Myers we know and love in Halloween I and II. For instance, let's start with the fact that this movie really fails to capture the Halloween theme to begin with and that obvioulsy makes Myers less convincing in his ""boogeyman"" role. This movie attempts to take away the enigma that defines Michael Myers' character.In fact, Myers takes on all of these human emotions in this film. There is a particular scene where Myers is crying...ABSURD!!! That scene made Myers look like a wimp. Another scene has Myers driving this girl around town like he's on a date with his girlfriend. I can't recall Myers being all that interested in the opposite sex, other than when he kills them. I'm sorry but this is not the Michael Myers I know...the very scary, emotionless killing machine driven by an evil force type Michael Myers that was so brilliantly captured by John Carpenter in parts I & IIAlso, Dr. Loomis and Jamie Lloyd both act like fools in this movie and Loomis appears to die for the second time, only to return in part 6 of course. To be frank, there really isn't a character in the entire movie that you can sympathize with.This movie only reaffirms the fact that the only really good Halloween movies were Halloween I & II because this is where the mysterious and evil Michael Myers is at his scariest and most emotionless state...hence, the boogeyman characterization fit perfectly in these movies.In the subsequent sequels, Myers becomes something else, in a sense more human and definitely less scary. Evidently, Myers also put on quite a bit of muscle while he was in that coma for 10 years because this Myers is considerably larger than the original.Halloween 5 really misses the boat on Michael Myers and the Halloween theme. I know AMC has this movie on every day, but I wouldn't watch it again unless you paid me. Halloween III is considerably better than Halloween 5 and Myers wasn't even in that one.I recommend every horror movie fan purchase Halloween I & II as no collection is complete without it, but if you buy Halloween 5 thinking it is going to be anywhere near or like the first two, you are going to be incredibly disappointed. Basically, if you love Halloween I and II, you are probably not going to like Halloween 5.  To be completely frank, this movie is garbage and is no better or worse than parts 6-8 of this series.",1,I HATE THIS MOVIE...it's just terrible.,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,2999,"['have', 'seen', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'Halloween', 'parts', '5-8', 'are', 'equally', 'terrible', 'really', 'movie', 'subsequent', 'sequels', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'trash', 'Picking', 'up', 'exactly', 'where', 'Halloween', '4', 'left', 'off', 'see', 'Myers', 'actually', 'survived', 'being', 'shot', '50', 'times', 'state', 'police', 'Evidently', 'idiot', 'Myers', 'nurses', 'back', 'health', 'course', 'Myers', 'rudely', 'thanks', 'killing', 'just', 'Halloween', 'murderous', 'rampage.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'mess', 'made', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'possible', 'way', 'reconcile', 'behavior', 'patterns', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Part', '5', 'Myers', 'know', 'love', 'Halloween', 'II', 'instance', 'let', 'start', 'fact', 'movie', 'really', 'capture', 'Halloween', 'theme', 'begin', 'obvioulsy', 'Myers', 'less', 'convincing', 'boogeyman', 'role', 'movie', 'take', 'away', 'enigma', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'character.In', 'fact', 'Myers', 'human', 'emotions', 'film', 'particular', 'scene', 'where', 'Myers', 'crying', 'ABSURD', 'scene', 'made', 'Myers', 'look', 'wimp', 'scene', 'Myers', 'driving', 'girl', 'around', 'town', 'date', 'girlfriend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'Myers', 'being', 'interested', 'opposite', 'sex', 'other', 'when', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'not', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'know', 'very', 'scary', 'emotionless', 'killing', 'machine', 'driven', 'evil', 'force', 'type', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'was', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'captured', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'parts', 'IIAlso', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'Jamie', 'Lloyd', 'act', 'fools', 'movie', 'Loomis', 'die', 'second', 'time', 'only', 'return', 'part', '6', 'course', 'be', 'frank', 'really', ""n't"", 'character', 'entire', 'movie', 'can', 'sympathize', 'with.This', 'movie', 'only', 'fact', 'only', 'really', 'good', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'were', 'Halloween', 'II', 'where', 'mysterious', 'evil', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'scariest', 'most', 'emotionless', 'state', 'hence', 'boogeyman', 'characterization', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'movies.In', 'subsequent', 'sequels', 'Myers', 'becomes', 'something', 'else', 'sense', 'more', 'human', 'definitely', 'less', 'scary', 'Evidently', 'Myers', 'also', 'put', 'quite', 'bit', 'muscle', 'was', 'coma', '10', 'years', 'Myers', 'considerably', 'larger', 'original.Halloween', '5', 'really', 'boat', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Halloween', 'theme', 'know', 'AMC', 'movie', 'day', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', 'paid', 'Halloween', 'III', 'considerably', 'better', '5', 'Myers', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'one.I', 'recommend', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'purchase', 'Halloween', 'II', 'collection', 'complete', 'buy', 'Halloween', '5', 'thinking', 'going', 'be', 'anywhere', 'first', 'two', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'incredibly', 'disappointed', 'Basically', 'love', 'Halloween', 'II', 'are', 'probably', 'not', 'going', 'like', 'Halloween', '5', 'be', 'completely', 'frank', 'movie', 'garbage', 'better', 'worse', 'parts', '6-8', 'series']",Halloween 5 VHS

I'll say that much for it.Never before have a seen a film that has been RUINED so much by the AWFUL teenagers (?) on display. They have nothing to do with the plot and contribute zero to the film. All they do is run around throwing up appalling dialogue, most of which is shockingly bad ADR ('nothing is all I get from you Michael'-check it out). For example there is a massive scene in a barn, which has nothing to do with anything, and is really only there to pad the film. These characters ruin the entire movie and I was very disappointed. Are we really supposed to side with them, perhaps fear for them when they are in trouble? I was relieved when they started getting knocked off.The scenes with Michael Myers (now played by Don Shanks instead of George P. Wilbur), Doctor Loomis and Jamie are the only reason I didn't eject this film. They are the saving grace of this movie. But, unfortunately, all the grace in the Universe cannot make us forgive this film for having such pointless and meaningless characters who turn it from almost a sub-par `psychological horror' to a `sub-standard cliche'. It's a shame.Halloween 4,5 and 6 started an ongoing plotline that was ignored in the abysmal Halloween H20 and Resurrection and it was also cut to shreds in the severely edited and re-arranged Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers. The fact that 4,5 and 6 could have been very good makes this film worthy of attention. The fact that 4,5 and 6 (are bad) is the fault of the creators. Tho I do appreciate the work that Anchor Bay has put into restoring the movie.The re-mastered Dolby 5.1 soundtrack has been created using the original Ultra Stereo tracks and sounds rather forceful and loud considering the basic production values. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture (Carpenter and CO. made them in 2.35:1 Panavision which is how Moustapha Akkad should have continued it from parts 4-6) is good looking and although the movie (is bad) it's presentation is more than acceptable. I also love the Limited Edition tins Anchor Bay puts them in. Some of you may hate them but I think they are rather neat. My copy is number 0843/15000. The extras consist of a thick booklet containing many production stills, a documentary in which the cast seem to be surprised at asked questions about such a forgotten film and a replica of the theatrical poster.

After the state police has unloaded on Mikey he falls down a mine shaft which happens to be conveniently located near a river offering a quick escape. The police appear to throw pipe bombs down the shaft and then casually leave, not thinking to collect the body and take it to the mourge. With the prior experience of Michael surviving gas explosions, gunshot wounds, and falling from high places one would think that the police would actually make sure Mike was dead before calling it a day. But hey I guess they want him to come back. It is probably a pretty dull town for a cop and maybe they are looking for a little action. The movie is pretty ridiculous and basically recylces scenes from the previous. We get the typical 80s MTV generation of annoying teenagers who serve as fodder for Mike. Then his annoying niece who now has a psychic connection to Mike which Dr. Loomis, Hes still alive yes, tries to capitalize on. The ending was so typical of a horror movie that i was actually laughing in the theatre. I almost had hope that the cops in this film had become smarter but no they remain stupid and easily ployed. Let me give a brief synopsis of the closing act. They use Mikey's niece as bait to draw him into an ambush. there are tons of police, swat, and national guard troops waiting to waste mike. You think to yourself, ok this is gonna be good. Then a random radio call comes in and all the cops pack up and leave. I thought to myself ""Really?"". couldnt they have left at least a small contigent to stay in case mikey shows? Nope. they all leave and as a result mike shows up, chases his niece around the house a little, then dies from a few savage blows with a piece of lumber from an old man.

255706,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,6301562925,J. B. Hoyos,"[1, 1]","HAPPY THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY, MICHAEL MYERS!!!If you read my review for ""Halloween 4,"" you know that I rationalized Laurie Strode's death, and other plot inconsistencies, by reasoning that installments four through six occur in the bizarre and mysterious world of parallel time.  It is exactly one year since Michael Myers was shot multiple times and fell into an ancient well.  The evil within him was apparently transferred to his niece, Jamie, when she touched his hand; dressed in a clown costume similar to the one Michael wore when he stabbed his sister, Jamie attempts to stab her step mom to death.  She is now in a children's psychiatric ward in Haddonfield.  (Would a town as small as Haddonfield have one of those?  Only in parallel time.)  Meanwhile, Michael Myers is lying in a coma in the shack of a hermit who lives on a river.  On the eve of Halloween, Myers revives and, to show his gratitude to the old man who took care of him, he kills him.  Myers proceeds to find Jamie and dispatch her.  She can not speak and has developed a psychic link with her uncle.  She can sense when he is near; she is gripped by a seizure whenever he begins to kill someone.Donald Pleasance returns as Dr. Sam Loomis; he employs some unethical tactics to trap Myers - tactics that jeopardize lives.  Also returning is the cute, adorable Danielle Harris as Myers' niece Jamie Lloyd.  Ellie Cornell reprises her role as Jamie's adorable foster sister, Rachel, who suffers the same fate as the lone survivor of ""Friday the 13th.""  Once gain, Beau Starr is Sheriff Meeker.  Wendy Kaplan is great as the feisty, perky Tina.  This installment introduces another character who will be more prominent in the next sequel; unfortunately, we never get to see his face.  He wears a long black coat and black silver-pointed boots.  (No, it's not Johnny Cash.)  This mystery stranger follows Myers and sets up a satanic shrine in his old house.In ""Halloween 5,"" the acting is inferior to what is seen in other sequels; Myers and Dr. Loomis are often seen lurking in the background, behind trees and bushes, as though waiting for their cues to go into action.  This destroyed the surprise factor.  At first, the body count looks as though it is going to be much lower than its predecessor.  Fortunately, for you high body count fiends like myself, there is the police station massacre, which provides a great ending, much like the one in ""Slaughter Hotel.""""Halloween 5"" tried to capture the nostalgia of the first ""Halloween.""  There is the friendship that Rachel shares with Tina and Sammi.  However, the movie is more like another sequel of ""Friday the 13th.""  There is a Halloween party at a farm and major characters go into the barn to make love; instead, they fall victim to Myers.  Also, all the partygoers decide to go skinny dipping and poor Tina finds herself alone with corpses and a deranged serial killer.Yes, ""Halloween 5"" is predictable and full of plot holes, but it is still an enjoyable ride through the amusement park of Michael Myers who has clearly established himself as legendary serial killer along with Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger.  This movie is highly recommended for fans of Michael Myers and fans of slasher flicks.

No. 4 is my second favorite because of the eerie scenes in the neighborhoods (dark shadows, fog, blowing leaves). It recaptured the suspense that No. 2 lacked because of the unrealistic darkness in the hospital. Even at night, a hospital is never that dark and empty, even during a power outage! No. 5 was good, but a slight letdown from No. 4. I thought the continuity from the end of No.4 to the start of No. 5 was done very well, showing how Michael escaped the mine shaft and survived to kill again next year.The scenes were scary and thrilling in the tradition of Halloween, but what ruined it for me was the old Myers house. It looked like some old, huge castle instead of the home we saw in No. 1 and No. 2.I am big on continuity in sequels, and it would have been much better if they had shown the same house from 1 and 2. If they had done this, I would have been more impressed and given this review an extra star.Don't get me wrong, I have all of the Halloween films (except for No. 3), and I love all of them. No. 5 had its moments. One thing done well was keeping us in suspense as to the identity of the man in the silver-tipped boots.

I mean they rushed into theaters so quick after part 4, this movie seems like it was made just to make money. I mean they turned  the franchise in a wierd way. I mean Michael all of a sudden has a  telepathic bond with his neice? The Myers house went from normal size to  mansion size. And the characters are paper thin. The teenagers in this film  are obviously just put in the movie to be slashed up by Michael. And they  killed off Rachel! The only real interesting teen. I mean the producers  made this movie like a Friday the 13th. I thought Michael is supposed to go  after and try to kill his family? In this movie he ditches Jamie and trys  to kill teenagers for more than an hour of the movie. And this man in  black/thorn cult was a really dumb idea. This movie needed to try to be  like the original. Not confusing the mythology. But the movie is still  interesting and the ending is entertaining at the Myers house but the true  ending of the movie still leaves you wondering. This movie could have been  a lot better, but is okay since you have to realize that this sequel  concentrated more about the money rather than a real plot.

TINA! TINA!"" will echo in your memory for years to come. Sometimes Danielle Harris, the little girl, resembled a dummy, as the camera froze on her face. Then, somehow, she would start to twitch, moan, roll her eyes, and go into a full-fledged fit of weeping, moaning and gasping. She was only equalled by similar antics of that old hambone, Donald Pleasance. His identical gestures, when he grabs the child and demands that she remember something, are strangely alike. I can see the director now, screaming: ""Show more emotion! Give us more ham! Roll your eyes more! Slobber and mutter more!"" In this movie, Michael dies about fifteen times. I finally lost count. He was shot and run down by a car and burned up and beaten over the head with an axe and stabbed and pushed down stairs and crashes through windows--but you know how it is with Michael Myers. A good monster is hard to kill. One final nightmarish flourish at the very end: just before we're finished,  the camera moves in on our shrieking little Joan Crawford.

When they replay the scene in 5, they made it look like 20 bullets, but nonetheless, he's back and alive and well.The problem with 5 is that it's simply not very scary. It takes place a year after 4, and again, Michael is after ""the little girl from part 4"". It's a pet peave for Halloween fans, but the mask in 5 is the worst the series as seen. It looks like a mask I could buy at Kmart on a blue light special. It looks nothing like the mask he had on in 1, 2 or 4. But annoying mask aside, the real sense of chills and thrills is really missing from this cheap imatation. They even infected the classic Halloween theme music with a horrible casio keyboard and is sorely missing from the already boring movie.Even Donald Pleasance (Loomis) looks bored throughout his stay in 5. Again, Michael is after his little niece (Laurie Stroade's daughter), sigh,again. She obviously got away in 4. This time around she's a mute and she only regains her speach near the end of the movie. A crying shame becuase she's a good little actor.Michael once again goes on another killing spree on Halloween to get the little girl in his clutches. Plot is weak, acting is subpar, and the murder scenes are anything but creative. They actually made it more gory than 1, 2 and 4 combined, but once again, gore does not mean better, its' about suspense, and Part V has none of that.The best movies in the series are 1, 2, 4 and H20. Other than that, steer away from the others, especially this one.

I really wasn't missing very much.  While the overall Halloween atmosphere is an improvement over the original Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981), the plot and especially the characters bring down this movie.  I found the characters incredibly annoying.  Injecting camp into a Halloween movie is just plain wrong.  A little bit here and there for comic relief is OK, but then the line needs to be drawn.  There was a new director for this movie and I think he was off the mark with the characters' behavior.My favorite Halloween movie in the entire original Halloween series of movies between 1978 and 2002 is Halloween III - Season Of The Witch (1982), starring Tom Atkins, Stacy Nelkin, and Dan O'Herlihy.  If you want to watch a far more serious and darker movie, then watch this one.  The atmosphere is eerie, the musical score is John Carpenter's best (collaborating with Alan Howarth), there is suspense, and the story and plot are very unique.  It deals with a warlock madman who has a sinister plot against children on Halloween night.  It also has elements of the Celtic origins of Halloween 3,000 years ago in what is now Ireland.  It doesn't have tired old Michael Myers, either.  My second favorite Halloween movie is Halloween (1978).The Halloween movies that came after Halloween III are sub par.  In other words, when Carpenter and Hill exited, the movies went south.  Halloween 5 is fair at best and I give it 2 1/2 stars out of 5, but I rounded up to 3.",3,'80s slasher camp,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,1623,"['description', 'plot', 'etc.', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'Just', 'thoughts', 'movie', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Halloween', '5', '1989', 'last', 'week', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'missing', 'very', 'much', 'overall', 'Halloween', 'atmosphere', 'improvement', 'original', 'Halloween', '1978', 'Halloween', 'II', '1981', 'plot', 'especially', 'characters', 'bring', 'down', 'movie', 'found', 'characters', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'Injecting', 'camp', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'just', 'plain', 'wrong', 'little', 'bit', 'here', 'there', 'comic', 'relief', 'OK', 'then', 'line', 'be', 'drawn', 'was', 'new', 'director', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'mark', 'characters', 'behavior.My', 'favorite', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'entire', 'original', 'Halloween', 'series', 'movies', '1978', '2002', 'Halloween', 'III', 'Season', 'Witch', '1982', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Atkins', 'Stacy', 'Nelkin', 'Dan', ""O'Herlihy"", 'want', 'watch', 'far', 'more', 'serious', 'darker', 'movie', 'then', 'watch', 'one', 'atmosphere', 'eerie', 'musical', 'score', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'best', 'collaborating', 'Alan', 'Howarth', 'suspense', 'story', 'plot', 'are', 'very', 'unique', 'warlock', 'madman', 'who', 'sinister', 'plot', 'children', 'Halloween', 'night', 'also', 'elements', 'Celtic', 'origins', 'Halloween', '3,000', 'years', 'ago', 'what', 'now', 'Ireland', ""n't"", 'have', 'tired', 'old', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'either', 'second', 'favorite', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'Halloween', '1978', '.The', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'came', 'Halloween', 'III', 'are', 'sub', 'par', 'other', 'words', 'when', 'Carpenter', 'Hill', 'exited', 'movies', 'went', 'south', 'Halloween', '5', 'fair', 'best', 'give', '2', '1/2', 'stars', '5', 'rounded', 'up', '3']",Halloween 5 VHS
255721,A2MZ1VBYTQ7MO5,6301562925,Joseph Haggard Jr.,"[7, 10]","The ""Halloween"" franchise hit rock bottom in 1989 with the series' fifth entry, titled ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"". This is arguably the worst movie of the series. It's a badly acted, badly written, badly directed piece of crap that should be avoided at all costs. Donald Pleasence, who gave a very good performance in the original film, gives one of the worst performances of his long career in ""Halloween 5"". Pleasence overacts so terribly in this picture that you kind of hope Michael Myers will get to him just to shut him up. It's a real shame to watch this terrific actor being forced to look foolish on screen (especially when he tries to bully out some answers out of Michael's niece Jamie, who at the beginning of this film is mute and has developed a psychic link to Michael). Not to mention the other new characters make no impression whatsoever. An actress by the name of Wendy Kaplan comes off extremely annoying as Tina, who acts so hyper in most of her scenes as if she had previously been eating tons of Halloween candy. Ellie Cornell does return from the last movie as Jamie's cousin Rachel, but she ends up getting killed off early on. And the film goes over the edge in the climax when Michael tries to kill his niece. The climax is a perfect example of sloppy filmmaking. The director of this garbage is someone by the name of Dominique Othenin-Girard, and this filmmaker has no directing talent at all. The writing is atrocious with lots of asinine dialogue, thanks in part to Donald Pleasence shouting out his lines much of the time in absurd fashion. The main story: Michael Myers continues his quest to kill his young niece one year after the events of ""Halloween 4"". Big deal. It's basically the same movie as the last one. ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"" is junk at the highest level.

It reminded me of the third Howling film how they tried to breathe new life into the series, but instead it just seems tired and dated. As entertainment I would give it five stars as a work of art one and a half stars. Michael Meyers' mask was simply a Captain Kirk mask painted white. Only Halloween and other diehard horror fans would want to see this unless you were suckered when this was part of 80s pop culture. Halloween is the best horror series, because they were such predictable stalk and slash films with a lot of hokey suspense. It's so cheesy you can't help but like it. I wouldn't recommend though.

255723,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,6301562925,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[1, 1]",Yeah I have mixed feelings on Halloween 5. I do enjoy watching it but it could've been better if they would've took there time & maybe kept Dwight H Little but no we got Dominque Othenin Girard a French director they brought Michael Myers back playd by Don Shanks this time they should've followed the H4 ending. Jamie is mute for 50 minutes of the movie & Danielle Harris somehow pulls it off & I still want to root for her. I felt out of the 5 Halloween movies Donald Plesance was in this was his worst performance it's still better than anything Malcom McDowell can do. He still has some great lines & does more than H4 espically at the end. Wendy Kaplan plays Tina & I know a lot of people hate her but I've seen S&ugrave;t Talr Cmpon & she is irritating. Tina serves her purpose she wasn't a continuing character STC is & she's very irritating. I had fun with Tina & Smantha. Billy wasn't bad either he's just there Jeffery Landham does commentary he seems like a cool guy.  Other characters like Mikey this greeser & Spitz don't belong in a slasher.  These clown cops with there own music wtf? They kill Rachael in the 1st 15 or 20 minutes. Despite it's flaws it a good way to  pass the time Danielle  Harris like I said does a good job especially that attic scene she sells that Laundry Shute is a well done scene  & that's another thing Donald Plesance is out acted by a kid not his fault though It's the way Girard wrote Loomis he really didn't know how to write that character. The finish is good all through the Myers house that now looks like a mansion I don't know why & in part 6 it's a normal sized house. The ending I like Halloween series is good with these endings Man In Black guns down all the cops in Haddonfeild. I like the opening that was cool & the score was fine.  This was ment to be the of the Dr. Loomis character but I'm glad he was brought back. This symbol that Michael shares with this guy dressed in black it had to be confusing for audiences in 1989 with no explainaination. Jamie being telepathic was another problem. Why didn't the police search the mine shaft? The main problem is that it was a giant rush job & suffered from the same problems as NOES 5 the fact Dominque Othenin Girard threw the script in the trash can in front of Akkad showed he needed to be replaced he seems like a nice guy  from the commentary but I don't care for him as a director. The movie runs at a fast pace so that helps. This has to be the  worst Michael Myers the way he kills  Jason style & there's just no imagination to it.  In 4 & 6 maybe H20 he kills more aggressively & it's without warning still but they had a little too much fun with the gore. The mask is terrible it's the worst of the except for H2 09 what was that. It's not Don Shanks fault either it was how Michael was wrote.  He sheds a tear I know it has to do with future reference but that took 6 years.,3,Horror flicks & European art films don't mix 7/10,1287446400,"10 19, 2010",2010,2892,"['Yeah', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Halloween', '5', 'do', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'would', ""'ve"", 'took', 'time', 'maybe', 'kept', 'Dwight', 'H', 'Little', 'got', 'Dominque', 'Othenin', 'Girard', 'French', 'director', 'brought', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'back', 'playd', 'Don', 'Shanks', 'time', 'should', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'H4', 'ending', 'Jamie', 'mute', '50', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'somehow', 'off', 'still', 'want', 'root', 'felt', '5', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'Donald', 'Plesance', 'was', 'was', 'worst', 'performance', 'still', 'better', 'anything', 'Malcom', 'McDowell', 'can', 'do', 'still', 'great', 'lines', 'more', 'H4', 'espically', 'end', 'Wendy', 'Kaplan', 'Tina', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'hate', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'S', 'ugrave', 'Talr', 'Cmpon', 'irritating', 'Tina', 'purpose', 'was', ""n't"", 'continuing', 'character', 'STC', 'very', 'irritating', 'had', 'fun', 'Tina', 'Smantha', 'Billy', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'just', 'there', 'Jeffery', 'Landham', 'commentary', 'cool', 'guy', 'Other', 'characters', 'Mikey', 'greeser', 'Spitz', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'slasher', 'clown', 'cops', 'own', 'music', 'wtf', 'kill', 'Rachael', '1st', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'flaws', 'good', 'way', 'pass', 'time', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'said', 'good', 'job', 'especially', 'attic', 'scene', 'Laundry', 'Shute', 'well', 'done', 'scene', 'thing', 'Donald', 'Plesance', 'out', 'acted', 'kid', 'not', 'fault', 'way', 'Girard', 'wrote', 'Loomis', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'write', 'character', 'finish', 'good', 'Myers', 'house', 'now', 'mansion', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'part', '6', 'normal', 'sized', 'house', 'ending', 'like', 'Halloween', 'series', 'good', 'endings', 'Man', 'Black', 'guns', 'down', 'cops', 'Haddonfeild', 'opening', 'was', 'cool', 'score', 'was', 'fine', 'was', 'ment', 'be', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'character', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'symbol', 'Michael', 'shares', 'guy', 'dressed', 'black', 'had', 'be', 'confusing', 'audiences', '1989', 'explainaination', 'Jamie', 'being', 'telepathic', 'was', 'problem', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'police', 'search', 'mine', 'shaft', 'main', 'problem', 'was', 'giant', 'rush', 'job', 'suffered', 'same', 'problems', 'NOES', '5', 'fact', 'Dominque', 'Othenin', 'Girard', 'threw', 'script', 'trash', 'can', 'front', 'Akkad', 'showed', 'needed', 'be', 'replaced', 'nice', 'guy', 'commentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'director', 'movie', 'fast', 'pace', 'so', 'be', 'worst', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'way', 'Jason', 'style', 'just', 'imagination', '4', '6', 'maybe', 'H20', 'more', 'aggressively', 'warning', 'still', 'had', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'gore', 'mask', 'terrible', 'worst', 'except', 'H2', '09', 'what', 'was', 'not', 'Don', 'Shanks', 'fault', 'was', 'how', 'Michael', 'was', 'wrote', 'tear', 'know', 'do', 'future', 'reference', 'took', '6', 'years']",Halloween 5 VHS

Jaime, Michael's niece, inadvertenly touched him just before the police blew him away in a bed of dynamite. Consequently, his troubled spirit possessed this innocent eight year old girl and forced her to stab her foster mother on Halloween night.One year later, Jaime is a patient in a mental hospital for children. She suffers from nightmares, seizures, and she has lost the ability to speak. What she has been left with is the psychic ability to learn when her psychotic uncle is about to strike again. (He survived the explosion)Jaime's foster mom survived the attack and now she and her husband are off on a holiday, leaving their daughter Rachel behind for a day or so and she is about to join them. Feeling guilty about leaving Jaime, Rachel and her best friend Tina visit her in the hospital with their new dog, a sweet but protective Doberman Pinscher named Max.Back at the house, while Rachel is getting dressed to join her parents, she ignores Max's barked warnings and ends up being a victim of Michael's. Meanwhile, Jaime is participating in a Halloween pageant at the hospital when she gets the feeling that Michael is now after Tina, who is living it up at a high school Halloween party. Tina ends up sacrificing herself to save the little girl, but the chase doesn't end there. Dr. Loomis wants to get Michael home, hoping that will tame some of his rage against his family.

Michael killed Rachelle in the beginning which had my blood flowing because Rachelle was a major character in Halloween 4.  It showed to me that this movie would be unpredictable.  One thing I don't  understand is the very beginning.  It leaves off with the ending of  Halloween 4 and Michael falls into a grave, Halloween 5 added to this by  having Michael somehow end up in a river right after this.  How did he  crawl to the river if he was buried underground?  Other then this flaw, I  enjoyed the movie alot.  The Halloween music is what really gets my blood  flowing.  The opening credits got me excited right away when the  bone-chilling Halloween music played in sync with the knife stabbing the  pumpkin.  I also got this very same thrill throughout my body when Michael  is chasing Jamie in the car and Tina screams &quot;Leave her  alone! &quot;, the music and the horror acted together to really have me  excited.

How many times have you personally heard people bash a film on the basis of high expectations? There is no number high enough to even begin to reach the amount of phlack that films get from some of the stupidest people you'll ever meet. Sometimes, I wish there was no such thing has preview trailers, television spots, and people expressing what doesn't need to be expressed.So is the case with ""Halloween 5:The Revenge of Michale Myers."" The first 'Halloween"" film was an unexpected success. People flocked to it on the basis of small coments and reviews: ""brilliant, smart, too real to beleive."" But, as a matter of fact, these same reviews had previously called it everything besides those three comments and any sensible word that Webster can think up. So my question of the day: should we delete these beautiful things we call reviews?Sure, it's great that everyone gets an opinion. Without that fact, I wouldn't even be able to be writing this now. But sometimes I wish that people either weren't allowed to read reviews before watching films. I beleive people should go into a movie theatre with an open mind and sense of what they're saying.Obviously, the other reviews failed to realise this fact when writing their desription of the fifth film in the ""Halloween"" series. It is not the best film ever made which seems to be the standard these so-called reviews made when judging this great film. I love little Danielle Harris and the up-and-coming Ellie Cornell. Donal Pleasance is at a great peak, and the script is wonderful. End of story.Sure, this isn't the best, but it's not supposed to be.

255731,A1W0ODR0SK9H4R,6301562925,LeftManOut,"[1, 1]","Halloween 4 was a success in many ways. It introduced a new object of Michael Myers' affection, a new cast of characters to care about, a pretty fresh story line, and great acting as well as a couple scary moments. But where Halloween 4 triumphed, Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers falls flat on its face. It's not to say that this movie is horrible; it definitely has its moments. However the stories and ideas seem rehashed, and the movie is just generally less interesting than the last. There's plenty of things wrong with the movie, but there's also a few things it got right, and for that reason it's not a total write off. Although the story found in Halloween 4,5 and 6 would later be ignored by H20 and Resurrection, the trilogy did have some promise. Halloween 5: The Revenge Of Michael Myers just might not be the movie to stand out in the saga.So of course Michael didn't die when he got shot down the empty mine shaft at the end of Halloween 4. You'd think the police would check for a body instead of throwing dynamite down there and assuming that Myers is done for (won't they ever learn). After falling down the shaft Myers crawls out a nearby escape hole and then floats down a river to the house of a hermit. Unsuspectingly the hermit nurses Myers back to health, and to show his gratitude to the kind fellow, Michael obviously kills him the first chance he gets. This is the first instance where see the ""thorn"" symbol on Myers' wrist (which would later attempted to be explain in Halloween 6), which becomes an underlying theme in the movie. It's as if Myers isn't just an evil individual, but rather someone being controlled by some ""druid"" cult or something. This is what presents a lot of problems with the plot. First there's a man dressed in black walking around the city, also with a ""thorn"" tattooed on the underside of his wrist (also explained in part six), but the mysterious man does relatively nothing in the movie. You see him from time to time (usually only the lower section of his body) walking the streets or following Loomis in the Myers house, but that's about it. The only thing he does is apparently break Myers out of prison at the end. It would have been nice to at least have this character do something for the movie besides walk around mysteriously (*Note you don't find out until Halloween 6: The Curse Of Michael Myers that the ""man in black"" was the one who helped Michael escape from prison, so if you had never seen part six and only viewed part five, his presence would make little or no sense to you). Myers is of course out to kill his niece Jamie once again, after failing last time. Unfortunately Jamie has become a mute after the events of Halloween 4, and now is mysteriously linked psychologically to her uncle (don't ask how). So Myers of course returns a year later on Halloween to kill again. Ultimately Loomis knows that Jamie is the only one who can help him stop Michael. The cast is good, and entertaining. Most of the actors from Halloween 4 have returned, including Danielle Harris as Jamie, Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis, and Ellie Cornell as Rachel (although she doesn't last long). Tina (Wendy Kaplan) is a welcomed introduction to the cast, and gives the movie enough flavor to make it distinct from the last film.My main complaint with the movie though (besides the less than stellar plot) is that this movie is just not scary or suspenseful. I mean when you watched any of the previous Halloween movies (except the God awful Halloween III: Season of The Witch) you actually cared about the characters and feared for their lives when Myers was after them. In Halloween 5 you almost want the idiotic teenagers and Tina's jerk of a boyfriend to get what they deserve from Michael. There are very few suspenseful parts found within the film, and even those lack the intensity that previous scenes had. Most of the scenes play off ridiculous murders (at one point Myers actually takes the time to put a noose around a police officer's neck, before he throws him out the window. I didn't know serial killers has that kind of time). Myers even resorts to the least scary of methods to try to kill Jamie; he attempts to run over her with a car. Is this the same killer that we once feared in the previous movies? Also having Myers unmask himself, or even having him shed a tear in the scene with Jamie totally ruins his persona. The whole point of his character is that he was heartless and didn't care about who he killed. Now it seems Myers has a soul. The plot leaves a lot of holes in the story, and somehow you would have thought that the characters would have learned from the last film since it just happened. Sometimes it just seems ridiculous, almost like ""I can't believe they are doing this again."" The only interesting thing about the plot is at the end when Myers has apparently escaped from his cell, leaving you with another cliffhanger (and a segway to the next movie).Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers has its far share of problems. It's definitely one of the most inferior movies in the series (then again nothing beats good old Halloween III), but it has a couple moments. However plot holes, and generally uninteresting/hated characters really detract from the feeling the movie could have had. It didn't help that they attempted to make Myers a ""human"" in the film either (good thing they got him straightened out in the six film). If you're a die hard Halloween fan, then you might find some things about the film to enjoy, however overall it's a disappointment. Casual fans might want to skip this one, or only rent it/watch it on tv if they are interested. At this point the franchise started its decline for a bit, but thankfully it got back on track with H20 (only to be once again taken to the toilet by Halloween: Resurrection). I guess it serves a purpose in the end, but it does little for the series. Just don't go into it expecting too much.",3,What Have They Done To You Michael?,1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,5956,"['4', 'was', 'success', 'many', 'ways', 'introduced', 'new', 'object', 'Michael',

But to me, Halloween 5 is a movie which does well in the entertainment factor.  Michael Myers is back to slaughter more teen's in his quest to kill his niece, Jamie (Danielle Harris).  Danielle does an excellent job acting despite her age.  Sam Loomis returns, (Donald Pleasance) and play's his over caffinated character once more as his obsession with Michael continues, while he gives a great performance.  (&quot;But you know where he is!&quot;)  This movie was scary, which is what horror movies are designed to do.  It's eccentric camera angles help with the scary moments of the movie.  And the ending made us wonder which added depth to the film which is always a plus.  The things fans say that are stupid about this movie is Michael's mask and the fact that his home has turned into a mansion.  Those are okay arguements, but here are the ones the I think ruin the movie.  The movie was slow in the middle witht the barn scene.

One year after Michael was shot by Sheriff Ben Meeker(Beau Starr) and the country boys, Jamie Lloyd(Danielle Harris) is put in the Haddonfield Children's Clinic and is mute due to the events of Halloween 4. Michael rises from a coma and puts his mask on again. He goes back to the Carruthers house and kills off Rachel(Ellie Cornell). He pursues Jamie and Rachel's best friend Tina(Wendy Kaplan) through town, while Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasance) trys to lure him to the Myers house to finish him off once and for all. First of all, Michael Myers kills Rachel right of the bat. The psychic connection between Michael and Jamie was very dumb and Jamie got a little bit annoying after a while. Michael's mask is different. Dr. Loomis works in Haddonfield and works in the children's hospital that Jamie lives in. Skip Halloween III if you want to be really want to be scared!

I would suggest watching the previous Halloween films beforehand or else you'll be totally lost.

Sure, it does have its noticeable flaws and cringe worthy moments. The film suffers from a rough script and was rushed into production before the script could be perfected, it was released into theaters only a year after part 4 came out. While I can understand this argument, I would argue that almost all of the Friday The 13th films were rushed into production and were also released a year after their predessors and were far worse then what this movie did. Most people point out this movie's faceless characters but again, I would argue that Friday The 13th has done a lot worse when it comes to character development and yet, these films are not bashed for the same reason.While this isn't a great movie and no where close to the original John Carpenter film, I still feel that it includes some of the most epic scenes in the entire series, more so then the highly praised Halloween 4. The final 30 mintues are thrilling and the ending leaves you wanting more because you're not sure what's going to happen next.

255746,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,6301562925,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","I have mixed feelings about this movie.  It was very much a continuation of Halloween 4, taking place one year later.  It explained that Jamie (played by Danielle Harris) did not really turn evil, but developed a telepathic bond with Michael.  Because of that she can see when people are in danger from him.  He of course continues to try to get at her in order to kill her.  That part of the movie is fine.  Lets face it, Halloween was never going to be an award winning movie, but if you like the horror genre you are not really looking for that.My problem with this movie is how it set up the dreadful part 6.  It planted the seeds of the whole cult storyline with the mysterious man in black, and began all the nonsense that would follow in that movie.  I don't even have a problem with not killing off Michael, although if it had been done, it would have been a fine way to wrap up the story. They ended up doing a reboot with Halloween H20 a couple movies down the line which really pretended that 4 and 5 never existed anyway, so he could have been killed off here and still made the other.All in all, if you are a fan of the series this is worth having in your collection.  Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasence continued to do a great job in their roles.  Pleasence's role was reduced by now because of his age, but he still played Loomis with passion.  Obviously these movies are not going to appeal to everyone, but if you like the first two movies and the 4th then this one is worth having.",4,"The movie itself is not bad, but what came after it was very bad",1362700800,"03 8, 2013",2013,1501,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'continuation', 'Halloween', '4', 'taking', 'place', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'explained', 'Jamie', 'played', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'turn', 'evil', 'developed', 'telepathic', 'bond', 'Michael', 'can', 'see', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'danger', 'course', 'try', 'get', 'order', 'kill', 'part', 'movie', 'fine', 'face', 'Halloween', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'award', 'winning', 'movie', 'like', 'horror', 'genre', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'looking', 'that.My', 'problem', 'movie', 'how', 'set', 'up', 'dreadful', 'part', '6', 'planted', 'seeds', 'whole', 'cult', 'storyline', 'mysterious', 'man', 'black', 'began', 'nonsense', 'would', 'follow', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'problem', 'not', 'killing', 'off', 'Michael', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'way', 'wrap', 'up', 'story', 'ended', 'up', 'doing', 'reboot', 'Halloween', 'H20', 'couple', 'movies', 'down', 'line', 'really', 'pretended', '4', '5', 'never', 'existed', 'anyway', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'off', 'here', 'still', 'made', 'other.All', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'worth', 'having', 'collection', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'continued', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'Pleasence', 'role', 'was', 'reduced', 'now', 'age', 'still', 'played', 'Loomis', 'passion', 'Obviously', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'like', 'first', 'two', 'movies', '4th', 'then', 'one', 'worth', 'having']",Halloween 5 VHS

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[0, 0]","Beginning with H20, the Halloween series now completely ignores the events of Halloween 4, 5, and the Curse of Michael Myers, so these films fall into limbo.Since they couldn't get Jamie Lee Curtis to commit to the middle films, they tried to follow the story of Michael killing off members of his family.  Halloween 4 is the best of the bunch, 5 is a step down, and the whole house collapsed with the appalling Curse of Michael Myers.The redeeming features of 4 and 5 are clearly Donald Pleasance and Danielle Harris.  Pleasance is totally game as the obsessed Dr. Loomis, and indeed, in this version he seems ready for the loony bin himself as Michael Myers once again returns from death to stalk the hapless citizens of Haddonfield.  If you recall, Michael was hit by a truck and shot about 100 times at the end of 4, but nothing can stop Halloween financier Mustapha Akkad from resurrecting his favorite son for some more trick or treating.  You'll also recall a bold move at the end of 4 to send the series on a different path and make Michael's niece Jamie take over the family business of butchering.  Once again, the producers went safe and dropped that idea, preferring to let Mike do the slaughtering.Danielle Harris once again plays Jamie (the daughter of Jamie Lee's character).  She gives an impressive performance for a child actor in this one and is completely convincing as a terrorized 11 year-old that is now psychically linked with Michael.  I also liked the completely inept and moronic cops who exist to, well, die.  A shame they kill of Ellie Cornell, but the laws of slasherdom state that survivors of the previous film generally must die in the next installment just to show that like an elephant, Michael (or Jason, or Freddy) never forgets.The ideas are definitely there, and people are game, but the execution is so-so. The look of the film is good--it has a real Halloween, autumn feel to it and was filmed in Salt Lake City, Utah. There is a subplot involving a mysterious man who is following the action and makes for an ultra violent ending.  (He and Michael share strange symbolic markings.)  By the end of 5 we get the bizarre image of Michael in a jail cell (with the mask still on!) before we get the cliffhanger ending.  Sad that it would take six years for a sequel to explain what happened.  The Curse of Michael Myers (1995) is terrible, an example of trying to over engineer a slasher series to embarrassing ends.  The score is by Alan Howarth and is not as good as the subtle soundscapes he contributed to 4, but he tries to inject some life into the famous themes and cues.Part 5 is weaker than Part 4 and boils down to pretty much by-the-numbers slasher material, done with a bit more style and with some good acting.  Once again, it seems that they can't get the Michael Myers mask right, and this version is terrible.  Perhaps they try something different every time, but really, can they not just get a decent reproduction of the masks in Part I or II?I like the approach they took on with H20 and Resurrection, but these middle parts have Loomis, whose obsession and pronouncements of 'pure evil' define Michael as much as the mask and the kitchen knife.Definitely far from the series' finest hour, but recommended for die-hard fans, of course.

(Perhaps he has an inner ticking clock?) Showing a lack of hospitality by slaying his nurse, he ventures back to the same town as before: HaddonfieldThere young Jamie is recovering in a hospital. No, they didn't continue with the cool plot possibility that the ending of four hinted at. She is back to her sweet self but instead of being able to talk, she simply grunts and squeaks a lot. It's annoying.Loomis is there the whole time, but growing more unpleasant. He is determined that Myers is still alive and keeps trying to get Jamie's help through manipulation. She seems to have some sort of wierd psychic thing going down with her uncle -- which is cool in a small way but doesn't make a lick of sense either.The melodrama present in four is also here but enhanced, which I of course hate. The nurse who takes care of little irritating Jamie overdoses on drama and as a consequence I wanted to hunt her down and kill the woman myself.Jamie's aunt Rachel from the previous film is here and as always does a good job.

And another thing, I have reason to believe that Michael is now an undead killing machine... not mortal man can survive those kinds of shotgun blasts! a really big problem I had with this movie is the fact that Michael shows sympathy towards Jamie in one scene and that is unforgivable because we all know that he is a merciless killing machine!Acting: I do believe that Danielle Harris improved her acting a Helluvalot since part four but Donald Pleasance was made out to be crazy but he was still a good actor just a bit psycho!Gore: Pitchfork impalement, a scythe slice, a garden rake stab, some gory dead bodies (including a dog's), and some violent stabbings, slicing and dicing and there is more!Bottom Line: Even though this is the least successful at the box office pulling in $11 million yet still making it a success off of it's $3 million budget it isn't the worst one of the series and I'm not mentioning any of the names *Cough* Halloween *Cough, Cough* Resurrection *Cough* It could've been a lot better and I am definitely saying this one is worse than part four but it is still an entertaining ride and I do think it is more watchable that part four but just not as good!Suggested MPAA: Rated: R for strong horror violence, some language, and brief sexualityIs it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 7For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 3",3,Revenge of the Prolonged Night in Utter Terror!,1319414400,"10 24, 2011",2011,2489,"['movie', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'lot', 'offer', 'felt', 'bit', 'rushed', 'scenes.Plot', 'One', 'year', 'terrible', 'night', 'Jamie', 'Lloyd', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'hospital', 'disability', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'even', 'more', 'importantly', 'scream', 'took', 'down', 'Michael', 'shot', 'well', 'found', 'help', 'homeless', 'man', 'been', 'comma', 'year', 'now', 'awakened', 'revenge', 'Review', '3', 'million', 'budget', 'Dominique', 'Othenin-Girad', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Jacobs', 'Writer', 'Shem', 'Bitterman', 'Writer', 'create', 'hostel', 'yet', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Michael', 'very', 'little', 'bit', 'back', 'Bad-Ass', 'self', 'part', 'four', 'must', 'say', 'loved', 'lot', 'movie', 'one', 'had', 'more', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'soundtrack', 'more', 'adult', 'themes', 'high', 'body', 'count', 'gorier', 'deaths', 'part', 'four', 'will', 'ever', 'have', 'other', 'hand', 'created', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'yet', 'perfect', 'side', 'lacked', 'scenes', 'back', 'up', 'car', 'chase', 'was', 'great', 'even', 'when', 'Michael', 'crashed', 'was', 'quite', 'obvious', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'thing', 'have', 'reason', 'believe', 'Michael', 'now', 'undead', 'killing', 'machine', 'not', 'mortal', 'man', 'can', 'survive', 'kinds', 'shotgun', 'blasts', 'really', 'big', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'fact', 'Michael', 'sympathy', 'towards', 'Jamie', 'one', 'scene', 'unforgivable', 'know', 'merciless', 'killing', 'machine', 'Acting', 'do', 'believe', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'improved', 'acting', 'Helluvalot', 'part', 'four', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'was', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'crazy', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'actor', 'just', 'bit', 'psycho', 'Gore', 'Pitchfork', 'impalement', 'scythe', 'slice', 'garden', 'rake', 'stab', 'gory', 'dead', 'bodies', 'including', 'dog', 'violent', 'stabbings', 'slicing', 'dicing', 'more', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Even', 'least', 'successful', 'box', 'office', 'pulling', '11', 'million', 'yet', 'still', 'making', 'success', '3', 'million', 'budget', ""n't"", 'worst', 'one', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'mentioning', 'names', '*Cough*', 'Halloween', '*Cough', 'Cough*', 'Resurrection', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'am', 'definitely', 'saying', 'one', 'worse', 'part', 'four', 'still', 'entertaining', 'ride', 'do', 'think', 'more', 'watchable', 'part', 'four', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Suggested', 'MPAA', 'Rated', 'R', 'strong', 'horror', 'violence', 'language', 'brief', 'sexualityIs', 'Buy', 'scale', '1-10', '7For', 'Movie', 'scale', '1-5', '3']",Halloween 5 VHS

(2) Not hint about the stupid thorn curse, then I would probably like it a lot more! One year after stabbing her foster mother, Jamie Lloyd has been taken to a children's hospital. Since Jamie touched Michael's hand, she exhibits signs of a telepathic link with her Uncle Michael. On HALLOWEEN, Michael returns to Haddonfield to finish what he started last year. Rachel, Tina, Mikey, Spitz, and Sammy become Michael's new targets at a HALLOWEEN party as he tries to find Jamie. (That party was awesome with all the HALLOWEEN decorations and costumes!) I love the scene when Michael is chasing Jamie, Billy, and Tina through the cornfields with the car! Donald Pleasence is back playing the awesome Dr. Loomis who tries to hunt Michael throughout the HALLOWEEN night at all costs. Later, Loomis takes Jamie to the Myers house. I love scenes of the police and S.W.A.T. team stakeout at Michael's house. That's pretty cool. Loomis tries to reason with Michael one last time before the showdown. Loomis uses Jamie as bait to trap Michael. When Loomis finally stops Michael, he is taken to the police station, so that the U.S. National Guard will take Michael to a maximum-security prison until he dies, but something bad happens.

255769,AZAEN52HOZA7T,6301562925,"Reka Kovacs ""Madonna""","[1, 1]","This is an interesting sequel that follows number 4. Michael Myers is being shown from Halloween 4 being shot by numerous rounds of bullets and finally ends up floating in the river. He is pretty injured up from the wounds but is still alive. He manages to get out of the river and then collapses and an old man helps him recover even though Michael is unconcious.Halloween 5  does not have the dark, scary, foggy atmosphere that Halloween 4 had although there are a few moments. Danielle Harris reprises her role again as Jamie Lloyd.  Jamie is now in  special childrens hospital and cant talk but develops telepathy with her uncle Michael Myers and knows where he will strike and kill his next victim. She tries to do everything to stop him but she cant talk. You see this poor girl seeing these things and go into seizure like states desperately trying to say the words as to where he is to save the lives of her step sister and a friend.Donald Pleasance is back and is probably the only person along with Danielle Harris to make the movie good. Pleasance and Harris acting is very well done. The other acting is rather poor especially the teenagers. Like usual Michael is killing anyone in his  path to get to his neice Jamie. It would have been better if the story line was changed instead of the usual,  killing anyone who gets in his way scenario.  There are some entertaining moments where Jamie tries to talk to Michael so Michael can actually see her as a human being as opposed to seeing her as something else. There is an interesting scene where a  man in black boots  gets off a bus  and his hands have a mysterious symbol on them the same as Michael Myers does. Does this symbol tell us who Michael Myers really is? This man plays an important role towards the end. Dr. Loomis forces Jamie to be in Michaels old house near the end so they catch him. At the end Michael who is in jail and his neice is outside in a police car hears an explosion and investigates it. Michale is gone and it leaves you with questions as to who is the man in black that ""freed"" Michael.  Halloween 5 is probably more gorier than number 4 and  the body count is higher. I would recommend it to Halloween fans like me. It's not that scary though, maybe 1 scene at the most. This scene involving a Halloween party where a 2 teens go up to a old barn to have se* and Jamies friend is left alone after the party ends and has to deal with Michael on her own pretty creepy.

It had a terrible release and most fans I know hate this movie. I aapologize for my other Halloween reviews being so short, but I really dont have much to say, so this is my review of Halloween 5.Well, first we flashback to the end of Halloween 4, when Jamie stabs her stepmother to death. Now we cut to present, Jamie is in a mental institution, and is mute, needing the help of several doctors including Loomis. The whole concept of having Jamie mute kinda ruins alittle bit of the story for me, plus its probably a pain to act that way.Anyways, Jamie has a friend at the institution named Billy who has stuttering problems. He's oviously got something for Jamie, with his charm towards her. In a few moments, Rachel enters with a friend named Tina. Now to put on the record, I hated the Tina character. Just a snob, 80s bitch. She is so loud and has a terrible singing voice when she attempts that in the film. But now we'll go to the main character in the film, Michael. Well, we cut to the mine shaft we was blown into and crushed, but as we see in this, he squeezes between rocks, and then gets pulled down the current of a river, and wipes up shore of some random voodoo guy that lives near the river. He takes Michael in, thinking hes dead, but then Michael comes alive. He grabs the mask off the wall, and kills the man.Now, Michael is after Jamie, and tries to hunt down her location, but he soon finds Rachel at the house, and a couple more minutes into the scene kills her, much to mine, and alot of Halloween fans anger. They might as well of just killed her in part 4 if that were the case. Then (oh god!) Tina shows up at the house, wondering where Rachel is.Now not too much happens in the film throughout, but then we meet Tina's punk boyfriend Mike, who acts like a total big shot with a mulletin sunglasses and drves a dumbass car. Luckily, this guy doesn't last too long as getting jabbed with a pitchfork on his car. (HA!). Now there is some Halloween costume party at Jamie's clinic, where Bily dresses up as a pirate and kisses her. Off top of my head I forgot what Jamie was, but I think it was something like a ballerina or a fairy, comment and correct me if I'm wrong, but soon things go wrong at the party, and she is running in the streets (with her voice back), and eventually meets Michael, where he is DRIVING A CAR chasing her, but then the drunk driving Michael crashes into a tree and is still after Jamie.I forgot to mention, throughout the film, this guy wearing a black top had and a black cloak, shows up with a really odd triangle shape on his wrist, appearng throughout the movie, unidentified and noticed by people, which made half of america say ""WTF!"".The main finale of this movie takes place in Michael Myers childhood home, including a fun laundry shoot scene, and an awesome scene with Donald Pleasence losing hit and beating Michael to death. Then thats pretty much the whole movie, it was just released too soon after 4, and the ""man in black"" sure didn't help reputation of the film, but it was OK in my opinion, I gave it a 3/5.",3,Halloween 5 (1989),1222560000,"09 28, 2008",2008,3166,"['Well', 'first', 'Halloween', 'movie', 'part', '3', 'not', 'getting', 'good', 'reviews', 'had', 'terrible', 'release', 'most', 'fans', 'know', 'hate', 'movie', 'aapologize', 'other', 'Halloween', 'reviews', 'being', 'so', 'short', 'really', 'dont', 'have', 'much', 'say', 'review', 'Halloween', '5.Well', 'first', 'flashback', 'end', 'Halloween', '4', 'when', 'Jamie', 'stabs', 'stepmother', 'death', 'Now', 'cut', 'present', 'Jamie', 'mental', 'institution', 'mute', 'needing', 'help', 'several', 'doctors', 'including', 'Loomis', 'whole', 'concept', 'having', 'Jamie', 'mute', 'kinda', 'alittle', 'bit', 'story', 'probably', 'pain', 'act', 'way.Anyways', 'Jamie', 'friend', 'institution', 'named', 'Billy', 'who', 'stuttering', 'problems', 'oviously', 'got', 'something', 'Jamie', 'charm', 'few', 'moments', 'Rachel', 'friend', 'named', 'Tina', 'Now', 'put', 'record', 'hated', 'Tina', 'character', 'Just', 'snob', '80s', 'bitch', 'so', 'loud', 'terrible', 'singing', 'voice', 'when', 'film', 'now', ""'ll"", 'go', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'Michael', 'Well', 'cut', 'mine', 'shaft', 'was', 'blown', 'crushed', 'see', 'rocks', 'then', 'pulled', 'down', 'current', 'river', 'up', 'shore', 'random', 'voodoo', 'guy', 'river', 'Michael', 'thinking', 'hes', 'dead', 'then', 'Michael', 'alive', 'grabs', 'mask', 'wall', 'man.Now', 'Michael', 'Jamie', 'tries', 'hunt', 'down', 'location', 'soon', 'Rachel', 'house', 'couple', 'more', 'minutes', 'scene', 'much', 'mine', 'alot', 'Halloween', 'fans', 'anger', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'killed', 'part', '4', 'were', 'case', 'Then', 'oh', 'god', 'Tina', 'up', 'house', 'wondering', 'where', 'Rachel', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'happens', 'film', 'then', 'meet', 'Tina', 'punk', 'boyfriend', 'Mike', 'who', 'total', 'big', 'shot', 'mulletin', 'sunglasses', 'dumbass', 'car', 'Luckily', 'guy', ""n't"", 'last', 'too', 'long', 'getting', 'jabbed', 'pitchfork', 'car', 'HA', 'Now', 'Halloween', 'costume', 'party', 'Jamie', 'clinic', 'where', 'Bily', 'up', 'pirate', 'Off', 'top', 'head', 'forgot', 'what', 'Jamie', 'was', 'think', 'was', 'something', 'ballerina', 'fairy', 'comment', 'correct', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'soon', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'party', 'running', 'streets', 'voice', 'back', 'eventually', 'meets', 'Michael', 'where', 'DRIVING', 'CAR', 'chasing', 'then', 'drunk', 'driving', 'Michael', 'tree', 'still', 'Jamie.I', 'forgot', 'mention', 'film', 'guy', 'wearing', 'black', 'top', 'had', 'black', 'cloak', 'up', 'really', 'odd', 'triangle', 'shape', 'wrist', 'appearng', 'movie', 'unidentified', 'noticed', 'people', 'made', 'half', 'america', 'say', 'WTF', '.The', 'main', 'finale', 'movie', 'place', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'childhood', 'home', 'including', 'fun', 'laundry', 'shoot', 'scene', 'awesome', 'scene', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'losing', 'hit', 'beating', 'Michael', 'death', 'Then', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'too', 'soon', '4', 'man', 'black', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'reputation', 'film', 'was', 'OK', 'opinion', 'gave', '3/5']",Halloween 5 VHS
255780,A3GXPY4G7N9OIJ,6301562925,"Sal Palladino ""EternalMalice""","[2, 3]","The Halloween series was losing it's luster with the release of Halloween 3 which was a terrible mistake. Halloween 4 helped boost the series, but Halloween 5 was too rushed, therefore pushing the series down again.Halloween 5 picks up immediately where part 4 ended: After desperate attempts to kill his niece, Jaime Lloyd, Haddonfield police opened fire on Myers, sending him flying into an abandoned mind shaft followed by a stick of dynamite. Halloween 5 starts immediately after the explosion. Michael makes his way out of the mind shaft and into a stream barely escaping the explosion.It is a smooth transition between the two films, but you'll notice a difference in the new mask. The mask Myers dons in this film is completely rediculous and so far from the original that you'll shake your head in shame. Myers continues to float downstream until he ends up at an older man's house, or shack rather, and passes out and is in a coma for a year. The man takes care of him until Halloween arrives. The shape awakens, and disposes of him, and sets out to once again track down his neice, who has been admitted to a children's mental clinic due to the tramas (one of which... losing her voice) she has suffered from Michael.What I thought was cheesey is how little Jaime all of the sudden aqquired a sixth sense if you will. She can feel Michael Myers and knows his every move and location. This entry in the series also introduces you to a new character. A shadowy man dressed in black, always lurking around whenever Myers causes mayhem. While interesting, you don't really find out who, or what he is until Halloween 6 (The Curse Of Michael Myers).Another downfall of this film is the terrible characters. While always positive, Loomis returns yet again adding his own atmosphere to the film. The other characters however, are too few, and very one dimensional.I was really disapointed and bored with this film. The deathcount is really low, and the deaths that are in this film are very non creative. The film, in my opinion, doesn't really start to pick up and build momentum until the last half hour or so of the film, where Loomis and Jaime decide to lore Michael Myers into his house (which is now a mansion. What the hell were they thinking?!) so they can capture/kill him. I thought this sequence was excellent.This DVD does treat you with some nice special features, which is nice. You'll be treated to some theatrical trailers as well as an inside look at the making of the film.I wouldn't recommend this installment of the series to newcomers, and alot of Halloween fans will be disapointed.DVD SCORESVideo - 3/5Audio 4/5Special Features - 3/5",2,Halloween 5 - Sleeper hit?

255781,A26WVK274IA7DN,6301562925,Sarah Bellum,"[3, 5]","Well, they put in a good effort, anyway. There is decent lighting and cinematography, and there are some good performances, especially from young Danielle Harris as Jamie Lloyd Carruthers. This time around, Jamie is confined to a mental ward for children, where she experiences a psychic connection with her uncle, Michael Myers! Yes, Mr. Myers miraculously survived the pounding he took at the finale of part four and he is back to wreak further havoc!! Now, little Jamie can provide clues to help capture the crazed killer before he strikes again!!! This entirely unnecessary film would at least be acceptable if it did not try so hard to rise above its genre. This is not a great work of art; rather, it is a slasher movie (which, if done correctly, is an art form in its own right). What is the point of having a shower scene as well as a sex scene if no nudity is shown?! It is forgivable if there is no nudity in the film, provided there are no scenes that would normally involve actors disrobing. However, if there is both a shower scene as well as a sex scene, there had better be nudity involved; to include one without the other is an affront to fans of this type of film! It is called pleasing your audience; we expect it, so give it to us. While we are on the subject, how can it be acceptable to show graphic violence in a film and not nudity? Which is potentially more psychologically damaging to a delicate, young mind: the human form in its natural state, or one human brutally killing another? Among other annoyances with this film is the extremely poor degradation of two deputy officers, who are made to look quite foolish. The first couple times these two appear onscreen, some very comical, keystone cop-style music plays. It is very much out of place in this film and it is most irritating. At one point later in the film, one of the officers, in self reference, makes a comment to the effect that they are both bumbling and incompetent. It is difficult to fathom something like this being written, let alone making it to the film's final print. Also, the character of Michael Myers in this film appears to be a bit contrived, as though he is doing things simply in an attempt to scare rather than with good purpose. For example, he kills a young man, and then proceeds to pick up the man's girlfriend in his car at an appointed time. He sees fit to wear the deceased's Halloween mask in an effort to trick the young woman into thinking he is her boyfriend, which, of course, works well. When she goes inside a store to buy some cigarettes, Michael changes into his usual William Shatner mask in preparation for killing her. The purpose behind this? I wish I could say. In fact, I struggle to find reason for watching this film more than once. It is almost a shame that Anchor Bay went to such great lengths in producing this DVD; there is commentary from some of the cast and crew as well as a documentary. The transfer looks remarkable and the sound is good as well.

Halloween 5 further digs into the story of Michael Myers; in this sequel, it's proven that he is out to kill the rest of his female relatives, and the ""rage"" inside of him is driven by Jamie, the last survivor of the Myers blood, so she is obviously the target (that definately sounds disturbing, wanting to kill your niece, but hey, we all need hobbies, right?). After Michael is supposedly dead, we see that he managed to escape from the police and managed to crawl out of the manhole just before the bomb went off. So then we find Jamie in a hospital for kids, after killing her foster mother by (from what I understand) part of Michael's rage getting inside of her. Now, she can barely talk (until the end), but is now spiritually connected to Michael, and can pinpoint his exact movements and locations. Dr. Loomis depends on her to find Michael, in hopes of finally killing him or at least stopping the rage inside of him. Michael is put to sleep from some tranquilizer and put in jail, where he'll be transferred to a maximum security facility. But in the end, as Jamie walks through the jail, we see that it's trashed and he's escaped (!).It's weak points are pretty obvious: Some of the scenes are just flat out ridiculous, like when the friend of Jamie's foster sister Rachel, Tina goes into her house she shares with Rachel and acts out the infamous stereotypical teenage girl who's completely oblivious of the real world and doesn't even suspect that someone is in the house that shouldn't be there, and has a friend that is equally brain-dead as her. And at the party they go to, there's some guy in a costume that's hitting on Tina; we find out later that he has NOTHING to do with the plot. And while Tina is in the barn looking for the kitten she finds, can't she see the silhouette of Michael who is standing right in front of her? WTF? And finally, when Michael is in the jail cell, why don't they take off his mask? Don't they want to find out who he is? And come on, after seeing what he can do, you'd think they would immediately put him into a maximum security facility, not wait for a few days will he's put into a simplistic jail cell!Despite these problems, I can forgive H5 because it reveals more of the story of Michael and is nonetheless well thought out. H5 will never be up there with other slasher classics (such as the fist Halloween), but it's still a strong sequel, and while not the best of the series, it's definately worth more than 3.5 stars.P.S.

some bizarre twist & turns in this movie that didn't make sense that were also unsatisfactory as well along with the fact that this films on-screen titles don't even display ""The Revenge of Michael Myers"" subtitle which was used in all of the promotional materials such as TV spots, theatrical trailers, and merchandise.For instance, they showed a guy with a hat wearing a black trench coat & some boots not explaning to us who or what he is or what he has to do with the movie or with Michael Myers, but for some reason they had shown that mystery man shoot up the police station and to free The Shape leaving us another cliffhanger at the end, just like they did in HALLOWEEN 4:THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS, except I don't think HALLOWEEN V was as good as HALLOWEEN IV or even the first 2 Halloweens for that matter either, which reminds me that HALLOWEEN 5 came out in the movie theatres the same year A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET-PART 5: THE DREAM CHILD and FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART 8: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN were released in the movie theatres, since FRIDAY THE 13TH-PART VIII and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET-PART V were both released in the Summer of 1989 shortly before HALLOWEEN V was released in the Fall of 1989.HALLOWEEN V: THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS  also begins with a recap of HALLOWEEN IV: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS after Michael Myers(Don Shanks)falls down in a mine shaft & stumbles into a nearby river flow & becomes comatose for a year, but you can tell this sequel had a different guy playing The Shape and was wearing a different mask from its predecessor due to George Wilbur who played Michael Myers in HALLOWEEN 4 didn't express interest in returning to play The Shape since Wilbur had to wear hockey pads to appear having a bigger build, unlike Shanks who already had a larger build, but Wilbur returned to play The Shape again in HALLOWEEN VI: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS in the Fall of 1995.Unfortunately, Jamie's sister Rachel(Ellie Cornell) dies off in this sequel while Michael awakens again from another coma on Halloween Eve of 1989 to stalk his psychologically traumatized niece Jamie(Danielle Harris)again who is now committed to a psychiatric ward while Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasance) gets hot on Michael's trail again to stop and kill Michael once and for all again after so many failed attempts, except this time Dr. Loomis gets Haddonfield Sheriff Meeker(Beau Starr)to help him attempt to stop Michael for a second time in HALLOWEEN V, even though Chief Sheriff ends up dying off at the end this time.Meanwhile Michael goes on another killing rampage in the sleepy town of Haddonfield, Illinois stalking Rachel's friends Tina(Wendy Kaplan), Samantha(Tamara Glynn), Spitz(Matthew Walker)and Tina's boyfriend Mike(Jonathan Chapin).",4,A So-So

In Halloween 4 Dr. Loomis says that Michael kills his family members and anyone who gets in his way. In this movie, he kills people he doesn't need to kill and stalks teens at a party when he should be going after his niece. An example is Sammy and Spitz. They didn't need to die, but they did. Another thing about this movie that I hated was that it was really bloody and gory, and was a kill fest. Halloween 1 - 4 wern't gory, but this movie crossed the line. This movie also brought in the whole subplot of the Man In Black which made Halloween 6 to be bad. I would only reccommend this movie to people who love slash fast movies. Halloween fans will be dissappointed. The mask in the movie was really bad and there was really nothing I liked that much about it. Halloween 1, 2, and 4 had a great atmosphere on suspence and terror, this movie has an atmosphere on bloody, gory, multi-killing deaths. All I can say is that this movie could have been much better. It can't get any eaiser than that. Something better to buy is the Halloween 5 soundtrack which has really great music.

Myers escapes and is nursed back to health by an unlucky farmer. After a year, Jaime (Danielle Harris) is living at a children's hospital and is rendered mute by the previous year's ordeal. Occasionally, stepsister Rachel (Ellie Cornel) and her friend Tina (Wendy Caplan) visit, but as Halloween approaches, they get word of a party not far out of town. Tina's friend Samantha (Tamara Glynn) and their boyfriends, Michael (Jonathan Chapin) and Spitz (Mathew Walker), respectively, decide to join in. however, Jaime begins having day-mares that Myers is still alive, something Dr. Loomis knows too well. After Rachael has been killed, Loomis is convinced they are real, and he and Police Chief Meeker (Beau Starr) decide to play it safe and keep an eye on the party. After some practical jokes, Myers strikes, killing Samantha, Spitz, and nearly killing Tina, using a disguise borrowed from a newly killed Michael. Snapping out of her mute state, Jaime and Loomis attempt to bring Myers back to his old house for a last showdown.Horror veteran Pleasance, who has been in an inexhaustive list of horror films , is exceptionally eerie once again as Loomis. Throughout ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers"", Pleasance appears quite fatigued which adds weight to his portrayal of Loomis, a man who has suffered a lot. It is odd that anyone would let Loomis near a children's hospital, he is as obsessive and as freaky as Myers. The only person he can relate to is his former patient, his worldview narrowed(cf. the `mad' scientist of most horror). His relationship is quite paternal, note the softness (love) in his voice as he talks to Myers.  While Pleasence is solid in one of his final screen roles, the rest of the lackluster cast seems to be going through the motions.  The direction by Dominique Othenin-Girard is mediocre, bracing the audience with only moderately scary murder scenes and only a formidable climax.  What began as one of the most celebrated horror series has been sliced down to exactly what the horror genre became in the early to mid 1980's:  a chip off the old block that wasn't nearly as effective as its predecessors.",2,Halloween 5:  The Revenge of Michael Myers  (1989),1135814400,"12 29, 2005",2005,2559,"['Director', 'Dominique', 'Othenin-GirardCast', 'Donald', 'Pleasence', 'Ellie', 'Cornell', 'Matthew', 'Walker', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'Wendy', 'Kaplan', 'Beau', 'Starr', 'Tamara', 'Glenn.Running', 'Time', '96', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'violence', 'gore', 'language', 'brief', 'sexual', 'situations', 'Halloween', '5', 'Revenge', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'just', 'moments', 'previous', 'sequel', 'departed', 'police', 'looking', 'Myers', 'shot', 'down', 'mineshaft', 'Myers', 'escapes', 'nursed', 'back', 'health', 'unlucky', 'farmer', 'year', 'Jaime', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'living', 'children', 'hospital', 'rendered', 'mute', 'previous', 'year', 'ordeal', 'Occasionally', 'stepsister', 'Rachel', 'Ellie', 'Cornel', 'friend', 'Tina', 'Wendy', 'Caplan', 'visit', 'Halloween', 'approaches', 'get', 'word', 'party', 'not', 'far', 'town', 'Tina', 'friend', 'Samantha', 'Tamara', 'Glynn', 'boyfriends', 'Michael', 'Jonathan', 'Chapin', 'Spitz', 'Mathew', 'Walker', 'respectively', 'decide', 'join', 'however', 'Jaime', 'having', 'day-mares', 'Myers', 'still', 'alive', 'something', 'Dr.', 'Loomis', 'too', 'well', 'Rachael', 'been', 'killed', 'Loomis', 'convinced', 'are', 'real', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Meeker', 'Beau', 'Starr', 'decide', 'play', 'safe', 'keep', 'eye', 'party', 'practical', 'jokes', 'Myers', 'strikes', 'killing', 'Samantha', 'Spitz', 'nearly', 'killing', 'Tina', 'using', 'disguise', 'borrowed', 'newly', 'killed', 'Michael', 'Snapping', 'mute', 'state', 'Jaime', 'Loomis', 'attempt', 'bring', 'Myers', 'back', 'old', 'house', 'last', 'showdown.Horror', 'veteran', 'Pleasance', 'who', 'been', 'inexhaustive', 'list', 'horror', 'films', 'exceptionally', 'eerie', 'once', 'again', 'Loomis', 'Halloween', '5', 'Revenge', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'Pleasance', 'quite', 'fatigued', 'weight', 'portrayal', 'Loomis', 'man', 'who', 'suffered', 'lot', 'odd', 'anyone', 'would', 'let', 'Loomis', 'children', 'hospital', 'obsessive', 'as', 'freaky', 'Myers', 'only', 'person', 'can', 'relate', 'former', 'patient', 'worldview', 'narrowed', 'cf', 'mad', 'scientist', 'most', 'horror', 'relationship', 'quite', 'paternal', 'note', 'softness', 'love', 'voice', 'Myers', 'Pleasence', 'solid', 'one', 'final', 'screen', 'roles', 'rest', 'lackluster', 'cast', 'be', 'going', 'motions', 'direction', 'Dominique', 'Othenin-Girard', 'mediocre', 'bracing', 'audience', 'only', 'moderately', 'scary', 'murder', 'scenes', 'only', 'formidable', 'climax', 'What', 'began', 'one', 'most', 'celebrated', 'horror', 'series', 'been', 'sliced', 'exactly', 'what', 'horror', 'genre', 'became', 'early', 'mid', '1980', 'chip', 'old', 'block', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'effective', 'predecessors']",Halloween 5 VHS

The producer of HalloweeN 4 seeing that the movie was #1 for two weeks at the box office decided to make a sequal to 4.  The Revenge Of Micheal Myers sounds good until you notice this is not the same Myers from 4.  Note the mask difference as soon as he escapes the mine explosion.  With the last Micheal Myers being small in stature (using hockey equipment to look buff up).  They hired a actor who not only taller but is a stunt man.  The mask is too long. Most of all why on earth would you kill off Rachel so easily?  I mean how many people who are smart in horror films ending up getting killed?  Her death was too early in the film to begin with.  Once again Danielle Harris does a great job renewing her role as Jamie.  Her acting is well scripted with the ""luandry chute* scene she did it herself.  Shows how devoted she was to her role.  When HalloweeN 9 or 1 comes later this year once again Danielle will be in HalloweeN.

Michael then wakes up from his coma on Halloween and repays the hermit by killing him and continues his pursuit on killing his niece.  Well in the ending of the last one Jamie killed someone in the house with scissors.  The Halloween series then turns more fantastical in this one.  SOMEHOW Jamie has a teleketic bond with his uncle.  So it meant Michael controlled Jamie to kill that woman and so they ruined the ending to the 4th installment.

The events in H5 pick up where they left off in the far superior and enjoyable Halloween 4.  When we last saw Michael Myers, he had been shot multiple times and left for dead after falling into a mine shaft.  True to form, Michael is alive, if only barely, and escapes only to be nursed back to health by an unsuspecting future victim.  Meanwhile, young Jamie is in under the psychiatric care of Dr. Loomis following her attack on her stepmother at the end of H4.  The promising and surprise ending of H4 is all but abandon as this movie becomes little more than a teen slasher flick.  Michael spends a good portion of the movie chasing down a handful of teens that really have little or nothing to do with the story.  In fact, they are so annoying that you can't wait to see them knocked off.  Unfortunately, Jamie's stepsister Rachel is killed early in the film.  Donald Pleasance turns in his usual spectacular performance.  The series also saw the introduction of the mysterious man in black, setting up the next (and even worse) sequel.  Even though the events of H4 - H6 are ignored in H20, these could have been a nice ""mini-series"" within the series.  The Halloween series was rejuvenated and off to a promising start with Halloween 4.  It is unfortunate that the story took such a cheesy turn.  As is typical of Anchor Bay, the DVD audio and video are top notch.  Die hard fans will probably want a copy for their Halloween movie libraries.

So, the problems are pletntiful...and I agree that those are all defintely bad things, but it still managaes to entertain and scare (me, atleast)...Daniel Harris, tho she doesn't have much to say in this installment, does what she can good. Donald Pleasence again plays his role as Dr. Loomis very well. Really, the only things that irratate me (besides those listed before) include the murder of Rachael; this would have been alot better if she had stayed alive for the whole film and fought beside Jaime., and the way that Michael stalks Tina and Sammy for no reason. Then again, why did he stalk Jaime, Lynda, and Annie in the first? The box for Halloween also lies. It says something like &quot;He's back, and this time they're ready&quot;; well, no, they're not.

This fifth effort is a bit more watchable than that horrific fourth part, but not by a wide margin.For a basic plot summary, Myers seems to have no ill effects from his tumble down a mine shaft at the end of part four, and continues his pursuit of young Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris), whom he has seemingly developed a sort of psychic bond with (she can sense when he is about to kill).  Still pursuing Myers is Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance), as well as a mysterious ""Man in Black"" who is introduced in this film and explained further in the sixth part.The obvious problem with this film is that it is basically a retread of its predecessor, breaking no new ground whatsoever.  Thus, things just keep getting more stale.  Dr. Loomis keeps spouting the same warnings (which are never heeded until it is too late), Myers keeps on slicin' and dicin', and no real character development is present.I have to give the movie credit for trying to explain the demented character of Michael Myers (e.g. tattoo on wrist, ""Man in Black"" presence, etc.), but they needed to give us more than that in THIS film, not the NEXT one (which they ended up royally botching anyway).  I think viewers are supposed to start to understand why Myers is such a maniac, but not enough hints are given to really make us care.About the only true bright spot (like in part four) is the acting of little Danielle Harris, who gives a very spirited performance for being such a youngster.  Without her presence, this film would be very near an abomination through and through.Thus, if you are a fan of this series you'll watch this flick no matter what I say, but don't be surprised if you feel you have wasted about 90 minutes.
