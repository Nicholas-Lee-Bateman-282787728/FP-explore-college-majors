Andre,"[1, 3]","this is one of the most visually fantastic giallo i've seen yet. the composition is perfect. beautiful images contrast a stark plot, as a real giallo should.there's a brief shot early on with to spiral stair cases on opsing sides of the huge building. this was one of my favorite shots in the movie but what did it even have to do with anyhting??any how, mr nero does well in this role and has an interesting look that is perfect for a leading man. the scene where he beats the piss out of a race car driver is pretty awsome. the music was just right. nothing like goblins deep red score which was quite a mess that with better direction could have been really something. the sets are one of the greatest thing about the fifth cord. it's all about the visuals and it seems that is where all the attention and effort went to for the most part. as a result it seems the story ends up lacking. however, trying to compensate for such visuals would require one hell of a story no matter what.the menu to this dvd is simple yet intense! the killers audio is dubbed over the excellent score accompanied by a tense clip from the film where the killer is running maniacly along the outside of a building, silouhetted by a dark blue background outside massive windows. excellent.highly recomend this one to just about anyone really.",3,"3 stars for the 5th cord, an above average giallo",1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,1322,"['one', 'most', 'visually', 'fantastic', 'giallo', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'composition', 'perfect', 'beautiful', 'images', 'contrast', 'stark', 'plot', 'real', 'giallo', 'brief', 'shot', 'early', 'spiral', 'stair', 'cases', 'opsing', 'sides', 'huge', 'building', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'shots', 'movie', 'what', 'did', 'even', 'have', 'do', 'anyhting', 'how', 'mr', 'nero', 'well', 'role', 'interesting', 'look', 'perfect', 'leading', 'man', 'scene', 'where', 'piss', 'race', 'car', 'driver', 'pretty', 'awsome', 'music', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'nothing', 'goblins', 'deep', 'red', 'score', 'was', 'quite', 'mess', 'better', 'direction', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'something', 'sets', 'are', 'one', 'greatest', 'thing', 'fifth', 'cord', 'visuals', 'where', 'attention', 'effort', 'went', 'most', 'part', 'result', 'story', 'up', 'lacking', 'however', 'trying', 'compensate', 'such', 'visuals', 'would', 'require', 'one', 'hell', 'story', 'matter', 'what.the', 'menu', 'dvd', 'simple', 'yet', 'intense', 'killers', 'audio', 'dubbed', 'excellent', 'score', 'accompanied', 'tense', 'clip', 'film', 'where', 'killer', 'running', 'maniacly', 'outside', 'building', 'silouhetted', 'dark', 'blue', 'background', 'massive', 'windows', 'excellent.highly', 'recomend', 'one', 'just', 'anyone', 'really']",The Fifth Cord

Some like 'knife of ice"" barely show any killing.  Film noir and the films of Alfred Hitchcock also can be within this genre as well as splatter flicks that are decended from mario bava's ""bay of blood.""  This is a story driven giallo in which the hero of the story only becomes less of a drunken loser through trying to find out who this killer is. At first he doesn't care and he's not a nice person , in fact he slaps around one of his girlfriends while drunk. But by the end of the movie he's ready to risk his life for others.  Franco Nero, who is a fantastic actor who pulls this transformation off nicely.  Blue Underground cleaned this movie up too.  I always buy blue underground movies because you know that they care about making a movie look good.Of late the major studios have also been cleaning up their movies on blu ray, a field that blue underground is also entering into.Too many other companies just sling out bad prints and don't even bother to try to fix them.  If you like mysteries and thrillers and don't expect a gore fest then you will enjoy figuring out who the killer is. I have seen many giallos and didn't guess who it was or why the killings were occurring until the last scene.  This was just a great flick in a cool type of movie from the ultra cool 1970's.  The heyday of all kinds of giallos also known as thrillers and mystery movies.",4,nero stands out.,1225929600,"11 6, 2008",2008,1464,"['Giallos', 'are', 'great', 'type', 'thriller', 'enjoy', 'not', 'havesuperbloody', 'gory', 'killings', 'like', ""'knife"", 'ice', 'barely', 'show', 'killing', 'Film', 'noir', 'films', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'also', 'can', 'be', 'genre', 'as', 'well', 'splatter', 'flicks', 'are', 'decended', 'mario', 'bava', 'bay', 'blood', 'story', 'driven', 'giallo', 'hero', 'story', 'only', 'less', 'drunken', 'loser', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killer', 'first', ""n't"", 'care', 'not', 'nice', 'person', 'fact', 'one', 'girlfriends', 'drunk', 'end', 'movie', 'ready', 'risk', 'life', 'others', 'Franco', 'Nero', 'who', 'fantastic', 'actor', 'who', 'transformation', 'nicely', 'Blue', 'Underground', 'cleaned', 'movie', 'up', 'too', 'always', 'buy', 'blue', 'underground', 'movies', 'know', 'care', 'making', 'movie', 'look', 'good.Of', 'late', 'major', 'studios', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'cleaning', 'up', 'movies', 'blu', 'ray', 'field', 'blue', 'underground', 'also', 'entering', 'into.Too', 'many', 'other', 'companies', 'just', 'sling', 'out', 'bad', 'prints', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'try', 'fix', 'like', 'mysteries', 'thrillers', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'gore', 'fest', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'figuring', 'who', 'killer', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'giallos', 'did', ""n't"", 'guess', 'who', 'was', 'why', 'killings', 'were', 'occurring', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'just', 'great', 'flick', 'cool', 'type', 'movie', 'ultra', 'cool', '1970', 'heyday', 'kinds', 'giallos', 'also', 'known', 'thrillers', 'mystery', 'movies']",The Fifth Cord
967766,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,B000E41MT0,Pork Chop,"[2, 14]","THE FIFTH CHORD (1975) is a spooky, whodunnit murder thrillerstarring the talented Franco Nero, who packs his characteristicconvincing, intense physical and mental presence to this Italian-mademovie.A number of elements from this movie, are typically from the 70'smaking the release a bit dated, such as the sideburns haircut, thearchitecture (wooden homes, with sharp geometry),_ raincoats and thesimplicity of the man and woman relationships that are portrayed.There is a conscious effort to make this movie stylish, by filming incustom, specially designed fancy homes, among the top 10% wealthy Iwould presume, and by the camera focusing on dozens and dozens ofpaintings on the walls of almost each and every home and office.From a cinematographical point of view, the camera shots are crystalclear, and well focused. The DVD transfer is outstanding.Some critics might suggest an excessively passive filming, but that'snot the case at all, as the movie has action scenes although mainlytowards the end of the movie, with probably a hand held camera.The soundtrack,  by Ennio Morricone, further emphasizes the spooky,neurotic mood that the movie tries to tell, and suceeds in doing so,although this movie will perhaps work best for those suffering frominsomnia.Overall, a well filmed movie, in a somewhat scary sequence of events,with Nero doing a great job bringing excitement and presence to thescreen.However, for those who aren't fans of these types of nightmarishstories, they probably should take a pass, especially since over 30years have passed since this was released to the theatres, and thereare better films.",1,"A spooky, whodunnit murder thriller from the 70's",1179964800,"05 24, 2007",2007,1622,"['FIFTH', 'CHORD', '1975', 'spooky', 'whodunnit', 'murder', 'thrillerstarring', 'talented', 'Franco', 'Nero', 'who', 'characteristicconvincing', 'intense', 'physical', 'mental', 'presence', 'Italian-mademovie.A', 'number', 'elements', 'movie', 'are', 'typically', ""70'smaking"", 'release', 'bit', 'dated', 'such', 'sideburns', 'haircut', 'thearchitecture', 'wooden', 'homes', 'sharp', 'geometry', '_', 'raincoats', 'thesimplicity', 'man', 'woman', 'relationships', 'are', 'portrayed.There', 'conscious', 'effort', 'make', 'movie', 'stylish', 'filming', 'incustom', 'specially', 'designed', 'fancy', 'homes', 'top', '10', '%', 'wealthy', 'Iwould', 'presume', 'camera', 'focusing', 'dozens', 'dozens', 'ofpaintings', 'walls', 'almost', 'home', 'cinematographical', 'point', 'view', 'camera', 'shots', 'are', 'crystalclear', 'well', 'focused', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'outstanding.Some', 'critics', 'might', 'suggest', 'excessively', 'passive', 'filming', 'case', 'movie', 'action', 'scenes', 'mainlytowards', 'end', 'movie', 'probably', 'hand', 'held', 'camera.The', 'soundtrack', 'Ennio', 'Morricone', 'further', 'spooky', 'neurotic', 'mood', 'movie', 'tell', 'suceeds', 'doing', 'so', 'movie', 'will', 'perhaps', 'work', 'best', 'suffering', 'frominsomnia.Overall', 'well', 'filmed', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'scary', 'sequence', 'events', 'Nero', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'excitement', 'presence', 'thescreen.However', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'types', 'nightmarishstories', 'probably', 'should', 'take', 'pass', 'especially', '30years', 'have', 'passed', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', 'thereare', 'better', 'films']",The Fifth Cord

There's akilla on the loose and he's hinting that there will be five murders.  What's the connection with the victims?  Like I'm gonna tell you, you'd just better see it.  The man hot on the killer's trail is alcoholic reporter Franco Nero!  There were about eight billion giallos around at this time, and The Fifth Cord stands above many of them.  It's got a great look and a very good performance from Nero.  Nero is a very good actor, probably one of the best to come out of Italy, and because of this he gives his character more depth than the average giallo hero.  Not much for gore, but this film really doesn't need it.  Yet again, Blue Underground has done us all a favor by releasing this film and cleaning it up as good as possible.  They also give us a 16 minute interview with both Nero and director, Luigi Bazzoni, who apparently was a really cool guy.

And if you're a fan of murder mysteries--especially the Italian variety known as gialli--then you'll probably eat this one up.  The story is pretty thin and it's not gore soaked like many others, but it's really thick with a somber, tense, shadow-filled atmosphere and it's well acted by the jaw droppingly handsome Nero, Rosella Falk and Sylvia Monti.  The climax, which begins in a fantastic modern house and ends in an abandoned factory is, for once, well choreographed and exciting.

967769,A2KNX6Y72E1FVJ,B000E41MT0,"V. Risoli ""black farmer""","[1, 2]","I went into the purchase of 1971's ""The Fifth Cord"" with the hope of seeing possibly a good giallo with the presence of an actor who had the caliber of Richard Harrison who I had recently seen for the first time in memory in 1967's ""Master Stroke,"" an unmistakably great Italian espionage/heist film that was relatively buried until now.  It is not available anymore.  ""The Fifth Cord"" is the original title of the book it is based on by D.M. Devine, but the movie went with another name until Blue Underground released their restoration and although Franco Nero had appeared in Italian westerns like Richard Harrison, I should have known better when I saw him in ""Camelot"" and was so unbelievable singing ""If Ever I Would Leave You"" to Vanessa Redgrave.  Nero and director of photography, the great Vittorio Storaro (who lensed ""Apocalypse Now""), were friends of the director Luigi Bazzoni and it is due to their presence that the film has any reputation today.  An interview with the two of them is part of the extras provided on the disc.  Even an ample cast can not bring it above mediocrity as a giallo who include Pamela Tiffin, Edmund Purdom and Rosella Falk.  The plot is a little tired ultimately as it has been done better without giving anything away and there is no gore really.  Even Ennio Morricone is wasted with his unexceptional score.
