However, the casting of Vanessa Williams as Dulcinea is wrong.  Dulcinea was a Spaniard from La Mancha in the city of El Toboso.  99.9% of Spaniards are white, mostly with dark hair but light to olive skin and fine facial features.  Vanessa Williams is a mulata (a mix of white and african black).  The Cervantes story originates in the 15th century (around the time of Christopher Columbus' Discovery).  The mulatos did not come into being until the 17th century and much more in the 19th century and later.  This was when the Black African slaves mixed with the European (French, British, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese) whites.

The scenery, the actors the story which is pretty similar to the original Servantes book. John Lithgow is fabulous as the don, sometimes funny, sometimes very serious and sometimas extremely shy. You cannot help but listen to him and you belive him more than the family who tell that the don has only dreams. When the prince and his wife (the beautiful - just like her mother - Isabella) make fun of him, you can really hate them and want to help Quijote and Pansa. John Lithgow has played not just with his body but with his eyes too. His eyes. At the end he has pratically no lines he just look at us and it is perfect. It was a beautiful story with a talented, real actors. Don't miss is if you like films that touch you heart and soul.

The filming is great and the setting are wonderful, the only thing I would change is to make in widescreen, but as for a made for TV movie they don't get much better. I would like to see this on DVD with all the extras, but for now the VHS will do.

566442,A1DLAV6VF6DZC9,B0000541V7,Film-Fan,"[3, 3]","I will start with a digression:  Though the book was published in two parts, the first in 1605 and the second in 1615, the story is by nature episodic and some episodes may have been published in the 1500's in periodicals.  In Spain, as with most of Europe, these misadventures were the source of much derisive laughter and even disdain for the knight.  The author encouraged this attitude -- at least in the beginning.  Cervantes noticed his readers' reactions and noticed his imitators who wrote their own episodes for the knight-errant.  He may have thought that the readers are missing part of this.  I'm sure he thought his imitators were humiliating the knight far too much.  This is supported by the second part of the book where the author has apparently changed in his view -- in fact their might be a slight hint of admiration for Uncle Alonso.  There is the charm!  Could this character have changed or even educated his own author?  You decide.  End digression.An ageing Spanish gentleman, Alonso Quixano, has an extreme fondness for books of chivalry.  He read books of chivalry every waking hour.  He liked them.  He thought about them.  Then he acted on them.  He sold some land for funding and went to see his neighbor Sancho Panza, a peasant.  After some prodding he was able to talk Sancho into being his squire and accompanying him on a quest.  Alonso would change his name to Don Quixote de La Mancha, a knight-errant.First on the list is getting knighted.  After all, one cannot knight oneself.  This will be quite a task since the last knight in Spain was at least 120 years earlier and the feudal system has relaxed a bit since the eleventh century.  However Uncle Alonso gets knighted as easily and quickly as if it was done every Saturday morning at the local convenience store.They have barely begun their journey, and not knighted yet, when they come upon some giants blocking their way.  The noble knight immediately charges on faithful Rocinante, his horse, with lance lowered toward the villains.  Of course the giants are really windmills and the arms are really the blades of the windmill.  The lance is caught in one of the windmill blades and the knight is taken high in the air.  ...Well, I can't tell whole story can I.The scenery and sets are beautiful and the cast is first rate.  The ending is very close to the book.  The book's ending is not like Man of La Mancha, the musical.  That's all I can say about it or you'll hate me.  Keep in mind that this is a founding work of Western Literature and one of the first novels.  Cervantes was about seventeen years older than Shakespeare.  Jousting anyone?A small suggestion, question, or both.

566443,A14BTJRH9VNLJJ,B0000541V7,Kurt A. Johnson,"[1, 1]","The aging Alonso Quijano (played by John Lithgow) loves to read the stories of heroic knights who bestrode the world so long ago. Losing some of his ability to tell reality from fiction, he styles himself Don Quixote de la Mancha, dresses himself in rusty old army, grabs neighbor Sancho Panza (Bob Hoskins) as his squire, and rides off in search of adventure. Sadly for Don Quixote, the world has changed a great deal since the time of knights in shining armor. [Color, created in 2000, with a running time of 2 hours.]I stopped when I saw John Lithgow and Bob Hoskins gracing the cover of this tape, and had to have it when I saw that the screenplay was written by John Mortimer (author of the Rumpole of the Bailey stories). The movie is visually stunning, with Quixote's hallucinations leaping off the screen in vibrant colors. Also, though the tape is marked as ""not rated,"" it contains very little violence, and nothing else that would make it unsuitable for younger viewers.Now for the bad news: the story is somewhat choppy, and, worse, seems to drag on with no real point. Though my children (7 and 10) liked the scenes with the giants, they became quite bored later and simply wandered away.  That said, I did enjoy this movie, and am glad that I watched it, though I may never bother to watch it again. Therefore, let me give this movie a very qualified recommendation.",3,"Good, but no better",1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,1380,"['aging', 'Alonso', 'Quijano', 'played', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'read', 'stories', 'heroic', 'knights', 'who', 'bestrode', 'world', 'so', 'long', 'ago', 'Losing', 'ability', 'tell', 'reality', 'fiction', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'la', 'Mancha', 'rusty', 'old', 'army', 'grabs', 'neighbor', 'Sancho', 'Panza', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'squire', 'off', 'search', 'adventure', 'Sadly', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'world', 'changed', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'knights', 'shining', 'armor', '[', 'Color', 'created', '2000', 'running', 'time', '2', 'hours', ']', 'stopped', 'when', 'saw', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'gracing', 'cover', 'tape', 'had', 'have', 'when', 'saw', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'John', 'Mortimer', 'author', 'Rumpole', 'Bailey', 'stories', 'movie', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Quixote', 'hallucinations', 'leaping', 'off', 'screen', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'Also', 'tape', 'marked', 'not', 'rated', 'very', 'little', 'violence', 'nothing', 'else', 'would', 'make', 'unsuitable', 'younger', 'viewers.Now', 'bad', 'news', 'story', 'somewhat', 'choppy', 'worse', 'drag', 'real', 'point', 'children', '7', '10', 'liked', 'scenes', 'giants', 'became', 'quite', 'bored', 'later', 'simply', 'wandered', 'away', 'said', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'am', 'glad', 'watched', 'may', 'never', 'bother', 'watch', 'again', 'Therefore', 'let', 'give', 'movie', 'very', 'qualified', 'recommendation']",Don Quixote VHS

The success is primarily due to the outstanding performances of John Lithgow as the Don and Bob Hoskins as Pancho Sanza and John Mortimer's script. Lithgow's Don has a dignified strength which balances his over active imagination while Hoskins tongue in cheek interpretation owes much to the human weaknesses that so many of us share.It took a little while for the film to gain pace but as compensation this adult production had an imaginative energy that brought to mind Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and a Midsummer Night's Dream-it was indeed a good ""Knight's"" entertainment!Not for the action film addict but willingly suspend your disbelief and connive with its reality as the Duke eventually did and you will certainly enjoy.",4,Quirky Classic,1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,1007,"['visually', 'sumptious', 'film', 'central', 'characters', 'gentle', 'quirky', 'humour', 'never', 'completely', 'dignity', 'humanity.It', 'almost', 'impossible', 'task', 'reduce', 'Cervantes', 'classic', 'novel', 'film', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'attempt', 'success', 'primarily', 'due', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'John', 'Lithgow', 'Don', 'Bob', 'Hoskins', 'Pancho', 'Sanza', 'John', 'Mortimer', 'script', 'Lithgow', 'Don', 'dignified', 'strength', 'active', 'imagination', 'Hoskins', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'interpretation', 'owes', 'much', 'human', 'so', 'many', 'share.It', 'took', 'little', 'while', 'film', 'gain', 'pace', 'compensation', 'adult', 'production', 'had', 'imaginative', 'energy', 'brought', 'mind', 'Shakespeare', 'Twelfth', 'Night', 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream-it', 'was', 'indeed', 'good', 'Knight', 'entertainment', 'Not', 'action', 'film', 'addict', 'willingly', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'connive', 'reality', 'Duke', 'eventually', 'did', 'will', 'certainly', 'enjoy']",Don Quixote VHS
