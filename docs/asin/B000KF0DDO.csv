It has most of the cast of Jackass minus arguably the two biggest stars-Bam and Johnny. The dvd came with a cool looking tv guide based on the movie as an insert and the menu to the movie was like the tv guide channel. I'd give them 5 stars for those two things alone. Sadly, the movie has a few funny scenes but alot of it is unfunny.

As a rabid Jackass fan I snatched this up the first time I saw it at the video store.  My wife was the sensible one and refused to watch it with me.  This isn't even remotely funny.  What could be added to this that wasn't in the original release?  More nudity?  More cursing?  More of Steve-O on a not only unfunny but truly frightening drug binge that when I first watched this I said to myself that he either needed to enter rehab or he was going to die very soon (Glad he went with rehab).  Seriously I love the Jackass guys and I try to support them in whatever they do, but this is just bad.  It is truly unwatchable.  There are two things I remember about this movie they are Chris Pontius playing Jesus (funny considering his infamous skit on Jackass) and feeling just sad and scared for Steve-O.",1,Unrated???

1033247,A3V5O5G3I1T2NX,B000KF0DDO,Mike,"[1, 3]","Being a fan of Amazon Women on the Moon and Kentucky Fried Movie, when I saw this at the video store, I was inclined to rent it.  Add the fact that it stars a few members of the Jackass crew, I was relatively stoked to see what this was all about.For anyone who isn't familiar with the first two films I listed, this movie isn't so much a movie, per se, as it is a collection of skits compiled into a movie.  The difference being while Amazon Women on the Moon featured a group of up-and-coming actors at the time (such as Arsenio Hall, David Alan Grier, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Phil Hartman to name a few), TV The Movie features mostly B-List celebrities in addition to the Jackass crew (Judd Nelson, Miguel A. N&uacute;&ntilde;ez Jr., Jason Mewes, and Tony Cox all make appearances.)The skits start off pretty funny, with Party Dude, The Real Fear Factor, a parody of the Jamie Kennedy show, and the first Tijuana Cops skit actually getting a laugh or two from my friends and I...... then it kinda goes downhill from there.After about a half hour, the acting become predictable.  You start noticing that Steve-O doesn't play too many roles except for the role of himself.  Preston Lacy doesn't play anyone whose size ISN'T an issue.  And throughout the film, there seems to be this fascination with midgets that goes beyond whatever roles might be suitable for Wee Man.  There's even a skit that advertises a fake line of Jackass figurines.  That was kinda weak.The skits are also what ends up dragging the movie down towards the end.  Instead of creating new ideas and working on them, the second half of the film takes the skits that were played out at the first half the film and just drags them on to unnecessary lengths.  While it would have been better to write new skits or just end the movie earlier, there's probably about 30 minutes of film that just seems completely unnecessary due to its lack of imagination.Overall, if you see this at the video store and it's not a two-day rental, or if you need to throw something in your NetFlix queue, then by all means.  If you're thinking about buying this movie however, unless you're a fanatic of either National Lampoon or the Jackass people, I'd find a better way to invest the money.",2,"Showed promise, then fizzled...",1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,2242,"['Being', 'fan', 'Amazon', 'Women', 'Moon', 'Kentucky', 'Fried', 'Movie', 'when', 'saw', 'video', 'store', 'was', 'inclined', 'rent', 'Add', 'fact', 'few', 'members', 'Jackass', 'crew', 'was', 'relatively', 'stoked', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'about.For', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'listed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'se', 'collection', 'skits', 'compiled', 'movie', 'difference', 'being', 'Amazon', 'Women', 'Moon', 'featured', 'group', 'up-and-coming', 'actors', 'time', 'such', 'Arsenio', 'Hall', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'name', 'few', 'TV', 'Movie', 'mostly', 'B-List', 'celebrities', 'addition', 'Jackass', 'crew', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'Miguel', 'A.', 'N', 'uacute', 'ntilde', 'Jr.', 'Jason', 'Mewes', 'Tony', 'Cox', 'make', 'appearances', 'skits', 'start', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Party', 'Dude', 'Real', 'Fear', 'Factor', 'parody', 'Jamie', 'Kennedy', 'show', 'first', 'Tijuana', 'Cops', 'skit', 'actually', 'getting', 'laugh', 'two', 'friends', 'then', 'downhill', 'there.After', 'half', 'hour', 'acting', 'become', 'predictable', 'start', 'noticing', 'Steve-O', ""n't"", 'play', 'too', 'many', 'roles', 'role', 'Preston', 'Lacy', ""n't"", 'play', 'anyone', 'size', ""N'T"", 'issue', 'film', 'be', 'fascination', 'midgets', 'roles', 'might', 'be', 'suitable', 'Wee', 'Man', 'even', 'skit', 'fake', 'line', 'Jackass', 'figurines', 'was', 'kinda', 'weak.The', 'skits', 'are', 'also', 'what', 'up', 'dragging', 'movie', 'down', 'towards', 'end', 'Instead', 'creating', 'new', 'ideas', 'working', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'skits', 'were', 'played', 'out', 'first', 'film', 'just', 'drags', 'unnecessary', 'lengths', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'write', 'new', 'skits', 'just', 'end', 'movie', 'earlier', 'probably', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'just', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'due', 'lack', 'imagination.Overall', 'see', 'video', 'store', 'not', 'two-day', 'rental', 'need', 'throw', 'something', 'NetFlix', 'queue', 'then', 'means', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'buying', 'movie', 'however', ""'re"", 'fanatic', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Jackass', 'people', ""'d"", 'find', 'better', 'way', 'invest', 'money']",National Lampoon's TV: The Movie
