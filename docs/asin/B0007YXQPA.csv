895569,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B0007YXQPA,David Bower,"[3, 3]","That title may exaggerate a little, but not too much; this film has some beautifully acted, very funny moments that actually stood out in our memories as much as the dramatic lightning storms pictured. The director, David Giancola, obviously has a deep appreciation of comedy as the comedy moments in the film are remarkably well done.The story is family friendly and captures some very natural family situations in a small town that is facing some big challenges. There really are some outstanding comedic moments during the movie that are worth the price of admission.The hero, a teen age boy named Eric, played by Jesse Eisenberg, makes an important discovery and no one will  believe him; the movie is the story of his rising to the occasion and taking the necessary steps to save his community.We enjoyed it and my wife, who is not a fan of disaster movies, said it was good and we both got some really good laughs from certain scenes. This is one I think the whole family can enjoy; while it is not a great movie it is a fun movie that entertains.",4,A Light Hearted Funny Disaster Film?,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,1053,"['title', 'may', 'exaggerate', 'little', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'actually', 'stood', 'out', 'memories', 'as', 'much', 'dramatic', 'lightning', 'storms', 'pictured', 'director', 'David', 'Giancola', 'obviously', 'deep', 'appreciation', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'remarkably', 'well', 'done.The', 'story', 'family', 'friendly', 'very', 'natural', 'family', 'situations', 'small', 'town', 'facing', 'big', 'challenges', 'really', 'are', 'outstanding', 'comedic', 'moments', 'movie', 'are', 'price', 'admission.The', 'hero', 'teen', 'age', 'boy', 'named', 'Eric', 'played', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'important', 'discovery', 'one', 'will', 'believe', 'movie', 'story', 'rising', 'occasion', 'taking', 'necessary', 'steps', 'save', 'community.We', 'enjoyed', 'wife', 'who', 'not', 'fan', 'disaster', 'movies', 'said', 'was', 'good', 'got', 'really', 'good', 'laughs', 'certain', 'scenes', 'one', 'think', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'fun', 'movie']",Lighting- Fire From The Sky

WALDER ""Paul Walder""","[21, 23]","This film is very good for effects from natural disasters, (lightning storms in this film) to the relationship between a father and his son. I am a big fan of John Schneider way back to his Dukes of Hazzard days, and recently brought Night Of The Twisters another natural disaster film starring John so I could not wait to get this release to. It is amazing that lightning storms like this could happen though hopefully not, and the destruction that can occur from it. The film was made in 2000 and even though it does not contain any extras it is still worth getting.

895575,ASRUYRC3R5J6Q,B0007YXQPA,sasha,"[3, 3]","This movie was not just fiction - some of the events mentioned can happen to anyone.  When I was living in Kansas I was sitting on my sofa with my feet on a glass coffee table w/metal bottom.  The sky was cloudy but there were no storms in the area.  All of a sudden a lightning bolt came through the window.  I had just taken my feet off the coffee table and the bolt hit that metal and danced around the room.  Truly frightening.  In 1932 my grandmother was hanging out her wash on on of those old metal clothes lines.  The sky was beautiful.  A lightning bolt struck the lines and hit my grandmother.  A neighbor saw it and rolled her in dirt which saved her life.  She was disabled with a heart condition for the rest of her life.  Lightning is dangerous.This movie shows how dangerous it is and it is not all fiction.  It was excellent and I really appreciated the producer showing how smart our kids really are.  Whether there can be a hundred year storm and some of the other incidents portrayed I do not know.This is a good movie for not only adults but kids.  I would use it as a teaching tool to help kids understand lightning, what to do in a thunderstorm and do it in a way that will stick forever.ENJOY!",5,LIGHTNING IS DANGEROUS,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,1216,"['movie', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'fiction', 'events', 'mentioned', 'can', 'happen', 'anyone', 'When', 'was', 'living', 'Kansas', 'was', 'sitting', 'sofa', 'feet', 'glass', 'coffee', 'table', 'w/metal', 'bottom', 'sky', 'was', 'cloudy', 'were', 'storms', 'area', 'sudden', 'lightning', 'bolt', 'came', 'window', 'had', 'just', 'taken', 'feet', 'coffee', 'table', 'bolt', 'hit', 'metal', 'danced', 'room', 'Truly', 'frightening', '1932', 'grandmother', 'was', 'hanging', 'out', 'wash', 'old', 'metal', 'clothes', 'lines', 'sky', 'was', 'beautiful', 'lightning', 'bolt', 'struck', 'lines', 'hit', 'grandmother', 'neighbor', 'saw', 'rolled', 'dirt', 'saved', 'life', 'was', 'disabled', 'heart', 'condition', 'rest', 'life', 'Lightning', 'dangerous.This', 'movie', 'how', 'dangerous', 'not', 'fiction', 'was', 'excellent', 'really', 'appreciated', 'producer', 'showing', 'how', 'smart', 'kids', 'really', 'are', 'can', 'be', 'hundred', 'year', 'storm', 'other', 'incidents', 'portrayed', 'do', 'not', 'know.This', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'adults', 'kids', 'would', 'use', 'teaching', 'tool', 'help', 'kids', 'understand', 'lightning', 'what', 'do', 'thunderstorm', 'do', 'way', 'will', 'stick', 'forever.ENJOY']",Lighting- Fire From The Sky
