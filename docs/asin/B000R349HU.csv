In fairness, Mirren is her usual (for the past 15 years or so, anyway) supurb self.  I love what she does with Jane in any of the Prime Suspects.  The other actors also did a fine job.  I also liked that Jane's career started with Bill Otley(sp?) and ends with him, basically, taking a bullet for her.  That made sense; despite their conflicts, he was that kind of cop. (I believe the actor playing was dying even then, but I may be wrong on that.) What I did NOT like was Mirren (and as I understand it, she had a signifigant say in the storyline) and the writers deciding to make Jane an alcoholic; further, one so out of control she shows up at work and around interviewees drunk!  Why is it when a successful, once ambitious, single woman decides to retire, she has to have SOME addiction????? It's a cliche I am heartily sick of!  I also felt the general storyline--in terms of the crime involved, I mean--was not nearly as interesting as Marlowe in Prime Suspect 1 or the Prime Suspect about the child pedophile ring (the one with Cieran Hinds as Edward Parker Jones).",3,Not one of my favorite Prime Suspects,1247270400,"07 11, 2009",2009,1186,"['own', 'first', 'five', 'Prime', 'Suspects', 'taped', 'off', 'television', 'rewatched', 'once', 'still', 'dislike', 'fairness', 'Mirren', 'usual', 'past', '15', 'years', 'so', 'anyway', 'supurb', 'self', 'love', 'what', 'Jane', 'Prime', 'Suspects', 'other', 'actors', 'also', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'also', 'liked', 'Jane', 'career', 'started', 'Bill', 'Otley', 'sp', 'basically', 'taking', 'bullet', 'made', 'sense', 'conflicts', 'was', 'kind', 'cop', 'believe', 'actor', 'playing', 'was', 'dying', 'even', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'What', 'did', 'NOT', 'was', 'Mirren', 'understand', 'had', 'signifigant', 'say', 'storyline', 'writers', 'deciding', 'make', 'Jane', 'alcoholic', 'one', 'so', 'control', 'up', 'work', 'interviewees', 'drunk', 'Why', 'when', 'successful', 'once', 'ambitious', 'single', 'woman', 'retire', 'have', 'SOME', 'addiction', 'cliche', 'am', 'heartily', 'sick', 'also', 'felt', 'general', 'storyline', 'terms', 'crime', 'involved', 'mean', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'interesting', 'Marlowe', 'Prime', 'Suspect', '1', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'child', 'ring', 'one', 'Cieran', 'Hinds', 'Edward', 'Parker', 'Jones']",Prime Suspect 7 - The Final Act

HBO has been, perhaps, the most successful at doing so, and THE WIRE remained the most resonant, beautifully written and produced mini-series I'd seen on the tube -- until PRIME SUSPECT hit the airwaves more than a decade ago.With each successive episode Helen Mirren's performances became more sensitive, her accurate portrayal of a gifted individual in crisis more acute.  The scripts and pacing were increasingly more suspenseful and the pacing spot-on.To be frank, I've never seen a mini-series episode which matches the caliber of PRIME SUSPECT 7, the final installment of this morally urgent series. The plotting and script of this three-hour study of a detective's decline and redemption, and the resolution of a crime which has become commonplace in American society -- is brilliant. Helen Mirren's portrayal of Jane Tennison has never been more fully alive, nor her struggles with her family, career and drink, more visceral.Of the seven installments of prime suspect, each parsed into two 90-minute chapters, this installment is nearly perfect, the suspense nearly unbearable, the urge to view again almost mandatory. This is not a video to rent, but one to buy.  It is one you will want to share with significant friends in your life because of the moral and ethical issues it taps so beautifully.Everyone associated with the production deserves praise, and Helen Mirren surely emerges here as one of the finest actresses of her generation.We've seen fictional accounts of a child's murder before, time and time again.

This time, Jane investigates the missing of a 14-year-old girl while struggling with her alcoholism and coping with her father's death from incurable cancer. She dedicated all her life, talent, energy, and heart to her work where she had proved to be the best but the price she paid is incredibly high.

With a prestigious history, some legendary programs--including ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" and ""I, Claudius""--have found acclaim, awards, and international audiences. Of late, ""Masterpiece Theater"" has been showcasing some ambitious literary adaptations with mixed results. Last season's high point, and a must for any lover of film, was the flawless adaptation of Charles Dickens' ""Bleak House."" A triumph in every regard, and featuring Emmy nominated turns by Charles Dance and Gillian Anderson, this program should be essential viewing for those that value literate, classy and wildly entertaining TV. This season's offerings have included ""To The Ends Of The Earth"" (an adaptation of William Golding's seafaring trilogy--'Rites Of Passage,' 'Close Quarters' and 'Fire Down Below'), a robust new version of Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre,"" a reimagining of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" and the swan song of Helen Mirren's Jane Tennison in ""Prime Suspect 7-The Final Act.""Unlike most entries in the ""Masterpiece Theater"" library this year, ""Prime Suspect 7"" is not a literary adaptation of a classic work. Instead, it is the final installment of the wonderful ""Prime Suspect"" series which began 15 years ago. In 1992, audiences were introduced to Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison who was the only woman in a London homicide squad. Passed over for promotion due to her gender, her big break came when another DCI suffered a heart attack. Stepping up as the leader of the squad, she encountered disdain and ridicule from the men of the unit--but through the years has garnered a grudging respect due to her investigative skills. Now, in ""Prime Suspect 7-The Final Act,"" Tennison faces her final case and her impending retirement after a cumulative 30 years working for the police.When a high school girl goes missing, police are quick to question possible suspects--from her parents, to a coach she may have been involved with, to a secret boyfriend. Learning more about the girl, it seems as if she was not the innocent most people believed her to be. Tennison befriends another young girl, a potential witness in the case who happens to be the victim's best friend. As Tennison faces retirement, she is still battling many demons--an estrangement from her family, a father in the hospital, and her alcoholism. Her friendship with the girl is a way for her to grasp the remaining part of her humanity, and to get some kind of understanding for the hard choices that she has made to further her career. Not to be dismissive of the actual police procedural--but in all honesty, it's not that hard to figure out. But you know what? Doesn't matter in the slightest.This program, more than any other in the ""Prime Suspect"" series, is a love letter to Helen Mirren. Tennison is easily one of TV's most difficult female characters--she is a mass of flaws and an absolute mess in most regards. Mirren has evolved with this character, so it's fitting that the final installment features Tennison at her most vulnerable. In a year where Mirren has won every award conceivable for both ""Elizabeth I"" on TV and ""The Queen"" at the movies--this, to me, (although not a royal) is her crowning achievement! It's a fitting tribute to a complex character and an opportunity for Mirren to grace us with another tour de force performance (she has previously won Emmy accolades for prior ""Prime Suspect"" installments). Recommended highly (but 4 stars due to the rather routine resolution of the film's central mystery), I will miss not having Jane Tennison to look forward to any more. A great series, a great good-bye. Buy them all right now!

The hysterical parents of 14-year-old Sallie Sturdy keep the pressure on to find their daughter's killer, as Tennison's alcoholism threatens to consume her personal and professional being. Tennison finds both an outlet for maternal instincts and a reminder of her own youth in Sallie's friend Penny Phillips (Laura Greenwood), who may know more than she is telling abut the crime. Penny's father and school headmaster (Stephen Tompkinson) and the girls' thuggish friend Curtis Flynn (Heshima Thompson) both have suspect connections to Sallie and suspect alibis. With no one, including Tennison, in full possession of his or her senses, this case careens toward its conclusion.Without Helen Mirren's reticence and force of personality, this final episode of ""Prime Suspect"" would be pure melodrama. Many of the characters are so overwrought that I would expect to find them heavily medicated or institutionalized. ""Prime Suspect"" always included melodrama, but these performances are so hysterical that they undermine the show's gritty realism. I fault director Philip Martin for that. Helen Mirren's sharpness and deliberation prevent Jane Tennison from becoming a similar caricature. She grabs the audience's sympathies, even as Tennison's behavior is sometimes alienating. As a window on the weight that decades of grim work have placed on Jane Tennison's shoulders, ""The Final Act"" succeeds admirably. In other respects, this episode is flawed. And I couldn't help wondering if the writers' intention was to advocate the omnipresence of CCTV cameras in the UK by making the video footage out to be essential to crime-solving.The DVDs (Acorn Media 2007): This is a 2-disc set with the first half of the film on Disc 1 and the conclusion on Disc 2 -an absurd waste of space in my view. Unlike some previous ""Prime Suspect"" DVDs, the film is in its proper 1.66:1 format, not full screen. Bonus features are on Disc 2, where you will find a ""Photo Gallery"" slide show of on-set photos and production stills, ""Cast Filmographies"" of 7 cast members, and a ""Prime Suspect: Behind the Scenes"" documentary (45 min). The documentary interviews producers and cast members from various ""Prime Suspect"" series, looks at the series' 15-year history, its inception, its themes, and inspirations. Also interviewed is Jackie Malton, the DCI who advised the first episode and on whom some of Jane Tennison's experiences were based.",4,A Sobering Retirement For DS Jane Tennison.,1190764800,"09 26, 2007",2007,2649,"['Prime', 'Suspect', '7', 'Final', 'Act', 'Detective', 'Superintendent', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'Helen', 'Mirren', '35-year', 'veteran', 'police', 'force', 'weeks', 'away', 'retirement', 'struggling', 'keep', 'head', 'above', 'water', 'last', 'case', 'hysterical', 'parents', '14-year-old', 'Sallie', 'Sturdy', 'keep', 'pressure', 'find', 'daughter', 'killer', 'Tennison', 'alcoholism', 'consume', 'personal', 'professional', 'being', 'Tennison', 'outlet', 'maternal', 'instincts', 'reminder', 'own', 'youth', 'Sallie', 'friend', 'Penny', 'Phillips', 'Laura', 'Greenwood', 'who', 'may', 'know', 'more', 'telling', 'crime', 'Penny', 'father', 'school', 'headmaster', 'Stephen', 'Tompkinson', 'girls', 'thuggish', 'friend', 'Curtis', 'Flynn', 'Heshima', 'Thompson', 'have', 'suspect', 'connections', 'Sallie', 'suspect', 'alibis', 'one', 'including', 'Tennison', 'full', 'possession', 'senses', 'case', 'conclusion.Without', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'reticence', 'force', 'personality', 'final', 'episode', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'would', 'be', 'pure', 'melodrama', 'Many', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'overwrought', 'would', 'expect', 'find', 'heavily', 'medicated', 'institutionalized', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'always', 'included', 'melodrama', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'hysterical', 'undermine', 'show', 'gritty', 'realism', 'fault', 'director', 'Philip', 'Martin', 'Helen', 'Mirren', 'sharpness', 'deliberation', 'prevent', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'becoming', 'similar', 'caricature', 'grabs', 'audience', 'sympathies', 'even', 'Tennison', 'behavior', 'sometimes', 'alienating', 'window', 'weight', 'decades', 'grim', 'work', 'have', 'placed', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'shoulders', 'Final', 'Act', 'admirably', 'other', 'respects', 'episode', 'flawed', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'writers', 'intention', 'was', 'advocate', 'omnipresence', 'CCTV', 'cameras', 'UK', 'making', 'video', 'footage', 'be', 'essential', 'crime-solving.The', 'DVDs', 'Acorn', 'Media', '2007', '2-disc', 'set', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Disc', '1', 'conclusion', 'Disc', '2', '-an', 'absurd', 'waste', 'space', 'view', 'previous', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'DVDs', 'film', 'proper', '1.66:1', 'format', 'not', 'full', 'screen', 'Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'Disc', '2', 'where', 'will', 'find', 'Photo', 'Gallery', 'slide', 'show', 'on-set', 'photos', 'production', 'stills', 'Cast', 'Filmographies', '7', 'cast', 'members', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'Scenes', 'documentary', '45', 'min', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'producers', 'cast', 'members', 'various', 'Prime', 'Suspect', 'series', 'series', '15-year', 'history', 'inception', 'themes', 'inspirations', 'Also', 'interviewed', 'Jackie', 'Malton', 'DCI', 'who', 'advised', 'first', 'episode', 'whom', 'Jane', 'Tennison', 'experiences', 'were', 'based']",Prime Suspect 7 - The Final Act
