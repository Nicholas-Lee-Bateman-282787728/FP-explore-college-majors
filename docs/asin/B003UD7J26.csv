I was surprised when I ran across this show and caught myself involved.  The characters are rich and intriguing.  Megan Hunt (Dana Delaney)is a tough appearing medical examiner balancing a new career after an accident that forced her into her new career.  She shows a softer side trying to get back in her daughters life after her ex husband won full custody in the divorce.  Dana plays it well.  I think she has finally found her best character in her career.  Her co-workers are a great match, her boss Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) makes a perfect match of wit and toughness.(And Hot!)  Bud, Peter and Samantha but heads with her methods but she wins their respect.  Ethan (Geoffrey Arend) is a character that is a typical researcher, that knows just enough to almost get it right.  The one character flaw is Curtis Brumfield (Windell D Middlebrooks) as another boss of such but I find it hard to take serious.  He doesnt seem the type to be well educated enough to be in the position. (This may be typical of some upper management in a lot of places in the real world.)  I love the show.

And that was because of the wallet being in the left hand back pocket, determining a left handed person. That would be wrong, as a left handed person would have their wallet in their right hand pocket and a right handed person would have their wallet in their left pocket.

1363494,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003UD7J26,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","From writer and producer Christopher Murphey comes a new ABC medical drama titled ""Body of Proof"" which made its debut on March 2011 replacing a canceled drama series.  With a short nine episode first season, the drama series was renewed for a second season and garnered positive reviews around the world where it has aired.""Body of Proof: The Complete First Season"" features 9 episodes on two discs. Here is a basic summary of each episode (Spoilerless summaries):DISC: 1EPISODE 1 - Pilot - Detectives work with a passionate medical examiner named Dr. Megan Hunt, but with her wanting to catch the killer of a young woman, they quickly learn that the medical examiner may tend to break her boundaries.

This is one of the few drama series on television where a lot of the scenes are shot outdoors, to there is good natural lighting and the series does look good on DVD.  I didn't see any major noise or compression artifacts. For the most part, the seventh season does look very good on DVD.AUDIO:As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and the series is primarily dialogue and music driven. Dialogue is clear and understandable, while the music has always played a major part for the series and definitely enhances certain scenes. Did notice the surround used in scenes with cutting of flesh (during surgery) which was quite clear.  There are a few mild action sequences but for the most part, this is a dialogue-driven drama series.The show is presented in English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Body of Proof: The Complete First Season"" includes the following special features:Examining the Proof - (10:21)  Cast, crew and creators discuss the fascinating elements that go into making death look real with the help of research and a team of medical advisorsIf Looks Could Kill - (5:33) From Dr. Megan Hunt`s high heels to Curtis and Ethan`s scrubs and wardrobe, go behind-the-scenes with costume designer Roberta Haze as she dresses the actors and creates looks that kill!Body of Goofs - (3:40) ""Body of Proof"" first season outtakes.New Evidence: A Sneak Peek at Season 2 - (:46) Short sneak peak for season 2.DISC 2:Normal & Extended episode of ""Episode 144 - Song Beneath the Song"" - This extended episode (48:01) and the normal episode (44:01) are featured on disc 5.EXTRAS:""Body of Proof: The Complete First Season"" comes with a slip cover case.JUDGMENT CALL:So far, with the first season of ""Body of Proof"", the characters and the overall premise of the series is very good and entertaining.It's a mix of a medical and police drama series...not to say it's ""Grey's Anatomy"" meets ""Castle"" kind of hybrid series but you have the medical side and then a medical examiner who tends to overstep the boundaries during a police investigation once in awhile.But the series does make things different in the fact that the main character, Dr. Megan Hunt, while a talented medical examiner and former neurosurgeon, she's flawed when it comes to things outside of her career.  She realizes what she lost when she lost and that is a failed marriage and a teenage daughter and a husband who are estranged.You can tell that she buries herself in work to avoid social interaction or to avoid the pain of losing her family but whether or not she likes it, her co-workers are her support, trying to get her out of this funk and make her more sociable but also giving her that extra push for her to have that relationship with her daughter.Dana Delaney does a spectacular job of playing the character who has confidence when it comes to her job but also her personality flaws when it comes to the more emotional and social aspects of her life.  And speaking of Delaney, I definitely love this character role since she played Nurse Colleen McMurphy on ""China Beach"" back in 1988-1991.  A strong character role, intelligent but yet not perfect...just a human being who works hard at her job but also has her own personal issues that she has to deal with.What I like about this is that many professionals I know are like that.  They put in a lot of hours in the office and deep inside, they know they should be with family but because of their dedication for the greater good of saving lives... it's a difficult choice and lifestyle which is rarely focused in a drama series.I have to admit that at first, I thought this was going to be a reversed-""Castle"" type series where Dr. Hunt would be overstepping the boundaries of her job during the police questioning of a potential suspect but I'm glad that it's not that type of drama series and that the writers are trying to do something difference.  Also, I like the fact that the other supporting cast were being utilized much more earlier in the series.While the series has gained critical praise, one thing that I do find the series a bit problematic is its criminal cases are predictable.  If anything, we are a bit spoiled in this day and age with many police or investigative series that really make you wonder ""who did it?"", ""Body of Proof"" is not exactly challenging the viewer as much.  But it's only the first season and it'll be interesting to see how the writers improve in season two.As for the DVD release, you do get nine episodes and special features and of course, the series is sold at a cheaper price because of the shorter season.  But overall, it's a solid series.  I just hope that the writers don't make Dr. Hunt too sociable (ala similar to Delaney's role in ""Desperate Housewives"") and to not have Dr. Hunt or Nicholas Bishop hook up.  There is a lot of exploring and potential for these characters but it's all about how they are utilized in each episode.  Especially with Dr. Ethan Gross and Dr. Curtis Brumfield, who are being used in season one for more comedic sake, would like to see them in more deeper, darker or dramatic scenes than just being used for comedy sake.Overall, so far, so good for ""Body of Proof"" and how things have played out this first season.  But we'll see how things go for season two!If you are looking for a fun, clever and entertaining drama medical/investigative series, definitely give ""Body of Proof: The Complete First Season"" a chance!",4,"""Body of Proof: The Complete First Season"" is a series worth watching!",1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,7819,"['writer', 'producer', 'Christopher', 'Murphey', 'new', 'ABC', 'medical',

The first episode suffered from he PP (Pilot Problem)  - trying to establish the characters and give some insight into their backgrounds and issues in a short amount of time.  The writers dealt with it by having them give speeches about what has happened to them and how they feel about it.  Yikes, if people at work over-shared like that I would definitely put up the TMI sign.  TMI - Too much information.Particularly when said speeches are OTN  - on the nose.  How about some subtext here?!  In real life people deny their feelings, try to cast themselves in the best light and generally don't come to the point.  Even sub-text 101 has people saying the opposite of what they mean.And then there is the issue of UV (un-satisfying villains).  One of the great things about mysteries and cop shows is that we have a strong expectation that in the end the bad guy will get his comeuppance.  In the three episodes that I have seen the guilty parties are not particularly ""villain-esque.""  They are trying to defend themselves against losing their families or kill someone they love by accident.  These folks have already lost before they get sent to jail and so have the people around them.  Ain't no satisfaction here.Lastly UC - Unlikeable Characters. In our house we always ask ""Which character do you want to be?""  In this instance none of the characters is particularly likeable.  Even the daughter is a spoiled brat.  Maybe the young lab rat escapes unscathed but everyone else is not someone I would want to be.Meanwhile, they've given Dana Delaney's character the interpersonal ineptitude of the ""Bones"" character, the cranky know-it-all characteristic of House and in the third episode I think I even saw her execute one of Gibbs' head slaps.

Lately it seems that every female lawyer, doctor or detective has to be subjected to the Western equivalent of foot binding.)

The premise is fairly straightforward: a bunch of producers at ABC decide that they need to capitalize on the success of House and Bones, so they attempt to rip off BOTH shows simultaneously by creating a character who is socially inept, brilliant and does everyone else's job. Unfortunately, where this premise falls down is that the writers, unlike the writers of either House or Bones (who are no Shakespeares, mind you), can't write their way out of a paper bag. The dialogue is clunky, consisting mostly of awkward overstated exposition, the characters are walking cliches, the acting is strictly Cigar Store Indian (think ""wooden""), and the logical errors multifold (e.g., full custody in a divorce does not mean that the other parent is denied visitation rights).

1363511,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003UD7J26,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","In a television landscape littered with so many procedurals, it's hard to get too excited about yet another. Face it, if you're honest, dozens of TV's top rated programs are exactly the same in vibe, tone, and execution if you trade out the often likable casts. It's like comfort food, easy to digest. There's just enough wackiness of plotting, just enough eccentricity of character--most exist and thrive for the sole reason of providing escapism. When ABC announced ""Body of Proof,"" two thoughts went through my mind. (1) It's good to see Dana Delany. Delany has been underserved, in my opinion, by many of her post ""China Beach"" roles. At one time, she seemed poised to be a break-out star but never successfully transitioned into feature films despite her undeniable talent and fearlessness in performance. And (2) the show would take the very conventional and expected routes of its crime drama precursors. I knew exactly what the show was going to be, but I watched anyway. I was proven right in my assumptions, but I was also entertained.If you don't know the premise of the show, it's fairly straight forward. Delany plays a brilliant medical examiner who has taken the post after her career as an even more brilliant surgeon was shortened due to a health related crisis. As an ambitious surgeon, Delany alienated herself from the world and saw her marriage as well as her relationship with her daughter dissolve. She is so hard-edged and confrontational, especially in the early episodes, it's hard to imagine her building constructive work bonds. She, of course, is so much smarter than everyone else in the show and often does the job of the police in recovering crime scene evidence, interviewing potential witnesses, and solving major murders. She's truly a one man show. In reality, her antics would get her sanctioned regularly and probably fired--but this is TV. Instead of hating her, the wacky crew of supporting characters come to form a grudging respect and all unpleasantness is kept in a playful light.Working as a combination of pre-existing shows (most notably House, Quincy, and CSI--but many others as well), the show is in the mystery of the week format. There is never any doubt that things will be tidied up by the end of an episode. I liked most of the supporting cast, but this is really Delany's show. If you like difficult Delany, then you like the show--and I did. The most interesting character, to me, besides Delany is her ex-husband played by Jeffrey Nordling. The interplay between the two is the series' most real feeling sub-plot as they try to work together to reestablish trust for the sake of their daughter. Season One consists of 13 episodes. All are pleasant enough, if not particularly distinguished, with certain peripheral storylines veering toward unnecessary silliness. It's not really about solving anything, but more about the journey to the conclusion. You can turn off your brain, get comfortable, and enjoy the banter. Lighthearted entertainment, but despite being a ratings hit--no big revelation in the world of TV fare. KGHarris, 5/11.",4,"If the Formula Is Not Broken, Don't Tamper With It!

She gives a fantastic performance in each show, bringing new things to her character that you didn't expect. I'm glad it was renewed for a second season, because there is obviously more to be brought to the table.The storyline here is nothing new really, it's basically ""Castle"" with Dana Delaney instead of Nathan Fillion. However, the characters here are genuine, and obviously weren't written together in a rush. Time was spent here, to make the show as good as it could possibly. I think this show, if it is continued to be done right, could be something of an American ""Prime Suspect"" (the BBC Helen Mirren program). That remains to be seen, though.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[24, 25]","Body of Proof was a mid-season replacement show for ABC so this two-disc DVD set contains the nine episodes that comprised ""the Full First Season"", making it easy for those who want to catch up before Season Two starts soon.It's a ""medical mystery"" series, which means there is usually one dead body at the beginning of an episode (episode 6 had two non-related dead people) and Dana Delaney - as a Medical Examiner (not the Chief however) and former surgeon in Philadelphia - and her team try to figure out who killed the dead person. There is an emphasis on MEDICAL here, with lots of graphic footage. Not only do the medical stay ""play"" with brains and livers, but also nearly every episode shows the chest of the victim being sliced open. In one episode, Delaney saves a patient by shoving her fist inside the incision!. If the description I just gave makes you uncomfortable the images on the screen are sure to make you feel worse.The plots are interesting and I like how they deduce the killer but I could use a bit less graphics.There's another issue I had with this show (though I'll still watch it). It is set in Philadelphia, but for some reason they decided to film the scenes (other than quick images of Center City Philly (where I live) and a few street images) in Providence Rhode Island! So the buildings won't look familiar - and the river is in in the wrong location. But the scriptwriters wanted to seem like Philly so they mention real places like Wynnefield and Narberth (suburbs) and Manayunk. That's fine. But then they create fictional names for streets and create things like Liberty Mall (what's wrong with Independence Mall?). And the creditability went out the window when, in one episode, a significant clue revolves around ""rent control"". New York may have rent control but Philly never did. There are other shows like Cold Case and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia which only have exterior scenes show here but at least they don't mix fictional locations with real ones. This issue will probably only affect those who know Philly well but it is annoying.The package includes a few ""bonuses"". First up is a 10-minute ""featurette"" on the making of of the show with lots of emphasis on the medical consultants who helped with the script. We also hear about the makeup artists and set design, though it's only the interiors that are discussed. Next comes a five-minute featurette on the costume designer, which is totally irrelevant unless you really care how high the heels are on Delaney's character. And then there is the requisite ""blooper reel"" (3  minutes). Add a ""preview"" of Season Two and you've got your bonuses.If it wasn't for the intriguing story lines, I'd probably pass on this series but it did get me hooked. If you have a strong stomach for seeing body parts, you can raise my rating to four stars. But if seeing an open wound disturbs you, look for another series to get involved with.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",3,Short first season; not for the squeamish or those who know Philly,1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,2965,"['Body', 'Proof', 'was', 'mid-season', 'replacement', 'show', 'ABC', 'so', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'nine', 'episodes', 'comprised', 'Full', 'First', 'Season', 'making', 'easy', 'who', 'want', 'catch', 'up', 'Season', 'Two', 'soon.It', 'medical', 'mystery', 'series', 'usually', 'one', 'dead', 'body', 'beginning', 'episode', 'episode', '6', 'had', 'two', 'non-related', 'dead', 'people', 'Dana', 'Delaney', 'Medical', 'Examiner', 'not', 'Chief', 'however', 'former', 'surgeon', 'Philadelphia', 'team', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'killed', 'dead', 'person', 'emphasis', 'MEDICAL', 'here', 'lots', 'graphic', 'footage', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'medical', 'stay', 'play', 'brains', 'livers', 'also', 'nearly', 'episode', 'chest', 'victim', 'being', 'sliced', 'open', 'one', 'episode', 'Delaney', 'patient', 'shoving', 'fist', 'incision', 'description', 'just', 'gave', 'uncomfortable', 'images', 'screen', 'are', 'sure', 'make', 'feel', 'worse.The', 'plots', 'are', 'interesting', 'like', 'how', 'deduce', 'killer', 'could', 'use', 'bit', 'less', 'issue', 'had', 'show', ""'ll"", 'still', 'watch', 'set', 'Philadelphia', 'reason', 'decided', 'film', 'scenes', 'other', 'quick', 'images', 'Center', 'City', 'Philly', 'where', 'live', 'few', 'street', 'images', 'Providence', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'buildings', 'wo', ""n't"", 'look', 'familiar', 'river', 'wrong', 'location', 'scriptwriters', 'wanted', 'seem', 'Philly', 'mention', 'real', 'places', 'Wynnefield', 'Narberth', 'suburbs', 'Manayunk', 'fine', 'then', 'create', 'fictional', 'names', 'streets', 'create', 'things', 'Liberty', 'Mall', 'what', 'wrong', 'Independence', 'Mall', 'creditability', 'went', 'window', 'when', 'one', 'episode', 'significant', 'clue', 'rent', 'control', 'New', 'York', 'may', 'have', 'rent', 'control', 'Philly', 'never', 'did', 'are', 'other', 'shows', 'Cold', 'Case', 'Always', 'Sunny', 'Philadelphia', 'only', 'have', 'exterior', 'scenes', 'show', 'here', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'fictional', 'locations', 'real', 'ones', 'issue', 'will', 'probably', 'only', 'affect', 'who', 'know', 'Philly', 'well', 'annoying.The', 'package', 'few', 'bonuses', 'First', 'up', '10-minute', 'featurette', 'making', 'show', 'lots', 'emphasis', 'medical', 'consultants', 'who', 'helped', 'script', 'also', 'hear', 'makeup', 'artists', 'set', 'design', 'only', 'interiors', 'are', 'discussed', 'Next', 'five-minute', 'featurette', 'costume', 'designer', 'totally', 'irrelevant', 'really', 'care', 'how', 'high', 'heels', 'are', 'Delaney', 'character', 'then', 'requisite', 'blooper', 'reel', '3', 'minutes', 'Add', 'preview', 'Season', 'Two', ""'ve"", 'got', 'bonuses.If', 'was', ""n't"", 'intriguing', 'story', 'lines', ""'d"", 'probably', 'pass', 'series', 'did', 'get', 'hooked', 'have', 'strong', 'stomach', 'seeing', 'body', 'parts', 'can', 'raise', 'rating', 'four', 'stars', 'seeing', 'open', 'wound', 'disturbs', 'look', 'series', 'get', 'involved', 'with.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A
