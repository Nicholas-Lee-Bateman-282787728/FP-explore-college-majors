The humor of Vash is great and the fact he is being chashed by the Insurance Agency women Milly and Maril they add even more humor. This is a semi-serious series.

Vash the Stampede, the walking one man destruction machine continues his adventures in search of love and peace in this series.Hard Puncher-  Vash is again attempted to be captured for his reward, this time by an entire town. This episode is memorable because it's the first time we see Vash fire a gun, finally showing why he's considered such a spectacular gunman. We also find out that Vash still has unfinished business with someone and won't have peace until he finds that person. It's also the first time Meryl finally believes that Vash is who everyone says he is.Lost July- A beautiful engineer comes to the town and it seems she holds Vash responsible for the destruction of the town of July and her parents' death. There's a very touching scene at the end where Vash shows a little of his heart and just how compassionate he is. He also seems to be not quite human with something he does in the building that's about to explode.B.D.N.- On a speeding train, Vash tries to protect a young orphan while also out smarting the bandits who have taken over the train. It's also the introduction of Rem, a woman who seems to haunt Vash.And Between the Wasteland and the Sky- The second part of a cliffhanger, Vash is challenged to a one on one duel with the leader of the bandits, which is complicated by the fact that the train is still out of control and heading toward a cliff.As the series builds, Vash becomes even more endearing as the seemingly bumbling, but ultimately highly intelligent and thoughtful hero.

The insurance girls continue to follow him even though Vash advises them not to and he finishes off the rest of the Gungho Guns and he is challenged with Legato with the power of choice and free will.  He goes against what he doesn't want to do most and that's to kill another (see someone die).  He learns to keep surviving...The death of Wolfwood (which was a very emotional, yet touching scene) was strong on his mind, but he keeps him close in his thoughts and his cross gun saves him from his brother pulling the trigger.  Vash may have got revenge, yes, but he see's Rem in somebody...Meryle reminds a man that wants to kill Vash for the death of his family to not take the life of another man.  She opens her arms and approaches him with open arms and speaks the words of taking the life of another is never a choice to come to.  Vash then learns to keep surviving even though you sometimes have to harm those that have harmed you in such a way that tears you apart deep down inside.  The last couple episodes spoke to me throughout the suspenseful battles and emotions of the characters and I'm sure it's spoken to many other fans out there as well.  Keep surviving and keep your vision clear to see the future...That's what Vash does after he silences his brother's life for taking Rem away from him.  There may be a lot of anime fans that are into the high action and excitement, which is necessary, yes, but Trigun is an important series from start to finish...I respect the show for the message that is given to you at the end.  Wolfwood's scene is definitely something to remember as it hits with emotion and real feeling, along with Vash and the Insurance girls.

Here he is again, just minding his own business in an Inperil City bar when another group of thugs with the $60 billion reward on their minds comes barging in to kill him. Vash takes them out no problem, but then finds that the ENTIRE city wants to take him down. Even kids are pulling out guns! At one time Inperil was a prosperous city centered around a Lost Technology power plant, but it broke and the city began to wither and die. They want to claim Vash's head so they can pay for the expensive specialists that can reignite the power plant's energy source. Realizing that even an entire city is no match for Vash, the local sherrif lets the Nebraska Brothers out of prison. In a send up of giant robots, one brother is a mad scientist type who rides on his godzilla sized cyborg brother who can shoot his fist like a chained rocket launcher. Unfortunately for Inperil, the Nebraska Brothers do not care how much property is destroyed or how many Inperilities are killed in the pursuit of Vash.I did not like the first volume of this series at all. In fact, if I hadn't checked the first three volumes of this show out from my local library, I would not have watched this second installment. But since it was free, I was like, ""what the hell"". I was really surprised with Lost Past. I really liked these 3 episodes. I guess sticking with a show past the first volume really does pay off sometimes. What changed my mind about Trigun? Maybe I got used to Vash's personality and humor, and I started finding some of his mannerisms and dialogue funny. Like when he shoots a whole gang of bounty hunters with toy gun darts before they can even draw their guns. I think what really made the show turn around was that the writers made these episodes form a continuity which flowed together whereas Volume 1 seemed disjointed and unconnected. I also was intrigued by Vash's mysterious past, driven home by the fact that he cannot remember the city he supposedly destroyed to earn the price on his head. I know Vash is more than he seems, but his origin is a mystery I really want to solve.The fact that this volume contains only 3 episodes is a bit of a rip-off that could not be pulled today. Just ask Bandai (They tried selling dvds with ONE episode!). But this was par for the anime course back in the day.
