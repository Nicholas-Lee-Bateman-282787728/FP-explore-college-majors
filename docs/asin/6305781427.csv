All the artists are given equal chance to exhibit their skills. Especially the violinist - Wow!Santorini is a real grandeur. The music just flows. I just recalled the moment I heard Yanni for the first time - it was Santorini. I was so thrilled to see Yanni playing it and I was not disappointed. It is a double-feast for I could feel not only the music but also the beauiful scenes of the structures from Acropolis appropriately picturized for the song. But unfortunately, this feast ends here itself.Keys to imagination, Within Attractions and One man's dream are fantastic. Aria is another masterpiece. Felista is a nice song for his mother. The End of August is to end the nice evening with a style.I think Yanni has given his best for this album - as he says. But I found two things missing in the DVD version: the sound effects are not all that good when compared to the CD version. The visual effects, especially lighting in most of the times, jazzy.Indeed a great experience.

I am not a real fan of New Age music but this concert has always interested me. I first saw it on VHS right after it came out and while not real thrilled thought it had potential.I was reintroduced to the show when it was released on DVD. A friend said that I had to experience it and so I watched it one night and was more impressed than I had been on that night 15 years ago when I first saw it. Time changes us I guess I'm more open to this type of music than I was then.Performed at the Herod Atticus Theatre at the foot of the Acropolis the show is a marvel of music and lighting. The music sometimes gentle sometimes bombastic feels right in this great venue. Yanni spends much of the time at the grand piano letting the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra take over many of the synthesized parts of the arrangements. The orchestra conducted by Shardad Rohani fills in the spaces in the prog rock format giving the music a fullness that fills the theatre.There are highlights from his band also:a great drum solo by Charlie Adams, driving percussion by Michael Bruno and fiery violin solos by Karen Briggs.While Yanni may not be to everyone's taste this is a good way to spend a couple of hours listening to music which you may not hear too often. Who knows you may even be taken aback by the experience.

The chemistry between Yanni the audience and the orchestra (he has the backing of a great philarmonic orchestra and two virtuosos on the violin) are unique. The place where the consert takes place is a monument with thousand years of history Parthenon and the theater of Herodotus of Attiki which are uniqly lit for the occassion. Watching how the audience reacts to these unique compositions is incredible. Track number 7 is great, the two violin players it is as if they have a competition who will play faster. And the last one (reflections of passion) is propably one of the best songs he has ever composed. it was my wedding song. If you are planning to visit Greece get this dvd. Watch it beforehand to see what awaits you, and see it afterwards as well and for sure it will give you a strong desire to go back; as it did to me when I watched it for first time in 1997 and I was for three years in a row outside of Greece.

There is a big different between Yanni's work with his small group and when he performs with a big orchestra, and this was the first evidence of that. I've watched this DVD (earlier, the VHS tape) now for 15 years and it's still some of the best music I've ever heard - and seen. I never get tired of listening or seeing it.  The colors from the purples, reds, yellows, etc that change all the time on the historic Acropolis site are beautiful, almost as beautiful as the music emanating from the musicians.You can always tell Yanni's personal musicians from the rest of the orchestra: they are dressed a bit different and all have the long hair! The most visible and electric of them all is violinist Karen Briggs, who just astounds with her playing. She and drummer Charlie Adams really ham it up on occasion, but that's part of the fun. Enjoyable, too, are the solos by bassist Rick Federrici and pianist Julie Homi, whose cat-like looks mesmerize me.  Of the above-mentioned musicians, I think only Adams remains with the orchestra.There is not a bad song in the bunch in this incredible concert.

Yanni's music had always bored me to death, but this live performance packs such a wallop to his music like never heard in the studio. Adding in the Royal Philharmonic gives much more stamina to his music. And you know his core band members are so into this that they put so much more energy into the performances that just couldn't be captured in the studio.I bought this on VHS right away and played it until the VCR was smoking and eventually blew up! Later on DVDs hit the medium and as I saw and heard the visual and sonic potential of these little CD-like discs from earlier releases like the DTS enhanced Eagles ""When Hell Freezes Over"", I knew this concert video would be a prime candidate for a major DVD concert release.Sadly, this release ended up being the most disappointing DVD I ever bought. The 5.1 mix is absolutely horrendous. Instead of utilizing the 64 track digital audio master tapes, they simply used the 2 track video soundtrack and artificially created some sort of surround mix that's completely out of balance. The rear channels seem to only come out of one side, so you're not getting a true multi-channel mix. The only way to reasonably listen to this is in the 2 channel PCM mode. Still sounds good, but the potential was completely wasted.From what I've understood from Yanni's website, was he had no control over the production of this DVD.

Just be aware that there is another version of this concert BUT IT IS MISSING several of the selections contained on this DVD.I also wanted to say that it's unfortunate that one reviewer was so distracted by Yanni ""swooning and jerking"" that he gave the music and performance low marks, but then that reviewer probably has no idea what it feels like to have the power and beauty of the music engulfing you and flowing through you, especially as you perform your own creations before an audience and feel that indefinable bond between you and them as you see their expressions and know that your music is touching the hearts and souls of so many. Speaking from experience, it is the music itself that fills you, flows through you and moves you, and if you're not repressed, you may be moved to show your feelings as you perform. You really can get lost in the music itself.  Heck you see that type of ""swooning and jerking"" in the performances of  lots of musicians from all genres of music whether rock and roll, hip-hop, country-western, New Age or whatever. They are simply moved by the music and their art.In any case, this is the best DVD version of this concert I've found and it has all the pieces that were in the broadcast.
