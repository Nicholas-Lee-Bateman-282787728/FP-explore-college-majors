374267,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6303430910,Acute Observer,"[2, 3]","Viva Zapata!, 1952 filmThe peasants from Morelos file a grievance as their lands were expropriated by a rich and powerful landowner. Can they get justice against the armed guards of the big landowner? Is Emiliano Zapata a trouble-maker? We see the people attacked and shot. Some flee to the hills. A stranger brings news. Madero, in Texas, leads the fight against Porfirio Diaz. Zapata sees a girl in church. He gets a job as a horse trader. Democracy means rule by the consent of the governed. When they see a man being taken away they react. [Note the right to keep and bear arms then.] People bang rocks in protest as Zapata is arrested. Others join in this parade to guard the prisoner. Zapata is released. Elsewhere a train in attacked and looted. The powder and dynamite are used to attack an army fort.We see their custom of courtship. They learn Diaz has fled the country! The people celebrate. Zapata marries. Will he find happiness now that the fighting is over? Zapata wants to learn how to read (keeping people ignorant is a means of oppression). Will people get back their stolen lands? Or are the same class of people now controlling Madero? ""You must trust me."" Zapata tries to teach a lesson to Madero about arms and freedom. How can the people keep their lands if they are unarmed? General Huerta wants to shoot Zapata now. [Does this predict the future?] A new law requires people to surrender their arms. [This can only lead to oppression.] Madero is surprised by General Huerta's invasion. Madero's death creates a new fight, for land and peace. Can peace come from violence? [""Si vis pacem parabellum.""]Emiliano does not take advantage of his position. General Huerta has fled the capital, defeated by the people in arms. Pancho Villa wants to return home. Now Zapata is in charge. The peasants of Morelos have a complaint against Zapata's brother. [This scene repeats the beginning of the movie to suggest the flaws of human nature are ever with us.] Zapata resigns to return home and do justice. The unarmed peasants continue to be oppressed. ""This land is yours but you must protect it."" The people must depend on themselves, not on any ""strong man"". [Still true today?] The new ruler of Mexico plans a war on Zapata's people, but they can't be located. They will set a trap for Zapata. [Everybody wants something.]A man tells of a way to get arms and ammunition for Zapata's forces. His wife suspects a trap (woman's intuition or common sense). ""A strong man makes a weak people."" [If it sounds too good, be wary.] And so Zapata goes to inspect the captured army post. A Judas kiss? People wait and watch silently. [A tip-off?] The white horse is restless. And so Zapata is liquidated. His body is displayed in the town market square. Yet the people keep their hopes alive. [""An unhappy people need a hero.""]Do you know what has been happening in Morelos in recent times? The 1968 Gun Control Act was followed by lower wages and higher taxes, the classic form of oppression. It has continued to this day. The use of ""eminent domain"" is used to expropriate people's lands and give them to a big corporation, a new form of feudalism (when peasant's lands were taken and they were turned into landless serfs).

374269,ARA48345JZPZR,6303430910,Archmaker,"[9, 10]","This brilliant film, which seemingly is forgotten, was one of the seminal movie experiences in my youth.  When I saw this as a boy, it made me want to be brave, it made me want to be part of a just cause, even a losing cause, it made me value the nobility of simple lives, it made me want to be better than myself.  Romantic?  Oh absolutely.  It was the romance of film that entralled me with uplifting and inspiring stories of flawed men and women who could embody nobility and the yearning for freedom and value in life.  As I write this, the Arab streets are full of people expressing this desire, for freedom and worth and value in their lives.  But, as this film so pointedly portrays, revolutions are often co-opted and betrayed, and the lust for and manipulation of power will undermine the noblest of intentions. Alas, revolutions are romantic, and hard realities play hell with them.Written by John Steinbeck and directed by Elia Kazan, and starring Marlon Brando at the height of his power and charisma, this story of the Mexican revolution is beautifully told and filmed with nothing short of brilliance.  Elia Kazan could tell a story!  You can see how scripts then were worked and polished like hard diamonds until  often sprawling stories could be told with economy and concision, without wasted camera work or dialogue.  The rise of Emiliano Zapata from illiterate peasant to revolutionary to President of Mexico is told plainly, but with great emotion and inspiration.  Brando here absolutely owns the screen and his brooding intensity perfectly matches the character of a man without formalities of education and wealth but with great depth of character and belief.  And Anthony Quinn is the perfect support as Emiliano's earthier and pragmatic brother, a role that won him the Oscar.  Jean Peters is gorgeous, and the black and white photography is superb.I cannot attest to the historical accuracy of the film.  I don't really care.  This is a movie that speaks to the plight, the sorrow and the glory of common people.  It speaks to the never-ending longing for freedom.  Rose-colored glass romanticism? Probably.  Again I don't care.  For around 2 hours during the course of this film, I want to believe.  This is a film that speaks to the heart.  And yet, Steinbeck and Kazan were not so carried away on their dream that they ignored the harsh reality that befalls the dreamer.I consider this amongst the finest films of its era.  That it seems to be lost in time I find a terrible shame.  Anyone wondering why Brando dominated generations of actors should see his work here to understand.  Brando seemed to absorb and become the romantic ideal he was portraying within the details of a closely observed reality.  He is magnetic and alive on screen in a way few other actors have ever managed to attain.There are moments in film that stir the heart and imagination.  When Brando as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront, picks up his jacket and tells Eva Marie Saint ""I'm going down there (to the docks)....and get my rights!"" was one, and the scene in this film when Zapata is being led back, on foot, by horsemen with a rope around his neck and the peasants come silently out of the hills and quietly surround him until his captors see the wisdom of releasing him is another.  Just great stuff.I hope people will re-discover this film.  I could not find it for many years until it recently played on TCM and I could see it again with new eyes after so long.  It still has its power, and it is still worth seeing.",5,Can you kill the Wind?,1298505600,"02 24, 2011",2011,3532,"['brilliant', 'film', 'seemingly', 'forgotten', 'was', 'one', 'seminal', 'movie', 'experiences', 'youth', 'When', 'saw', 'boy', 'made', 'want', 'be', 'brave', 'made', 'want', 'be', 'part', 'just', 'cause', 'even', 'losing', 'cause', 'made', 'value', 'nobility', 'simple', 'lives', 'made', 'want', 'be', 'better', 'Romantic', 'Oh', 'absolutely', 'was', 'romance', 'film', 'entralled', 'uplifting', 'inspiring', 'stories', 'flawed', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'could', 'embody', 'nobility', 'yearning', 'freedom', 'value', 'life', 'write', 'Arab', 'streets', 'are', 'full', 'people', 'expressing', 'desire', 'freedom', 'worth', 'value', 'lives', 'film', 'so', 'pointedly', 'portrays', 'revolutions', 'are', 'often', 'co-opted', 'betrayed', 'lust', 'manipulation', 'power', 'will', 'undermine', 'noblest', 'intentions', 'Alas', 'revolutions', 'are', 'romantic', 'hard', 'realities', 'play', 'hell', 'them.Written', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'directed', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'starring', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'height', 'power', 'charisma', 'story', 'Mexican', 'revolution', 'beautifully', 'told', 'filmed', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliance', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'could', 'tell', 'story', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'scripts', 'then', 'were', 'worked', 'polished', 'hard', 'diamonds', 'often', 'sprawling', 'stories', 'could', 'be', 'told', 'economy', 'concision', 'wasted', 'camera', 'work', 'dialogue', 'rise', 'Emiliano', 'Zapata', 'illiterate', 'peasant', 'revolutionary', 'President', 'Mexico', 'told', 'plainly', 'great', 'emotion', 'inspiration', 'Brando', 'here', 'absolutely', 'screen', 'brooding', 'intensity', 'perfectly', 'character', 'man', 'formalities', 'education', 'wealth', 'great', 'depth', 'character', 'belief', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'perfect', 'support', 'Emiliano', 'earthier', 'pragmatic', 'brother', 'role', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Jean', 'Peters', 'gorgeous', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'superb.I', 'can', 'not', 'attest', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'movie', 'plight', 'sorrow', 'glory', 'common', 'people', 'never-ending', 'longing', 'freedom', 'Rose-colored', 'glass', 'romanticism', 'Probably', 'Again', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', '2', 'hours', 'course', 'film', 'want', 'believe', 'film', 'heart', 'yet', 'Steinbeck', 'Kazan', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'carried', 'away', 'dream', 'ignored', 'harsh', 'reality', 'dreamer.I', 'consider', 'amongst', 'finest', 'films', 'era', 'be', 'lost', 'time', 'find', 'terrible', 'shame', 'Anyone', 'wondering', 'why', 'Brando', 'dominated', 'generations', 'actors', 'should', 'see', 'work', 'here', 'understand', 'Brando', 'seemed', 'absorb', 'become', 'romantic', 'ideal', 'was', 'portraying', 'details', 'closely', 'observed', 'reality', 'magnetic', 'alive', 'screen', 'way', 'few', 'other', 'actors', 'have', 'ever', 'managed', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'heart', 'imagination', 'When', 'Brando', 'Terry', 'Malloy', 'Waterfront', 'up', 'jacket', 'tells', 'Eva', 'Marie', 'Saint', ""'m"", 'going', 'there', 'docks', '.and', 'get', 'rights', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'film', 'when', 'Zapata', 'being', 'led', 'back', 'foot', 'horsemen', 'rope', 'neck', 'peasants', 'come', 'silently', 'hills', 'quietly', 'surround', 'captors', 'see', 'wisdom', 'releasing', 'Just', 'great', 'stuff.I', 'hope', 'people', 'will', 're-discover', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'find', 'many', 'years', 'recently', 'played', 'TCM', 'could', 'see', 'again', 'new', 'eyes', 'so', 'long', 'still', 'power', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing']",Viva Zapata VHS
374270,A6833RMCXTKLZ,6303430910,Augustine  Invictus,"[2, 2]","This may be an old movie with Marlon Brando,Anthony Quinn,Jean Peters,etc., but the achievement is remarkable. The depiction of the Mexican Revolution which happened in the 1900's is astounding. Pancho Villa leading the revolutionary forces from the North and Emiliano Zapata leading his rebel forces from the South is just astounding. Francisco Madero was the intelligent Mexican politician and hero in Texas who was the driving force for revolution against the corrupt government of Porfirio Diaz. Diaz was actually not an evil dictator but his unfortunate long term(several years) rule and corrupt administration was ""ripening"" for a change to a better and justifiable government. The evil one was General Huerta who should have been executed when Diaz left the country and Madero,Villa and Zapata finally found themselves in Mexico City. The events that followed are definitely worth watching. The ending is astoundingly authentic. One suggestion is one should review the history of Mexico beginning at the time when Porfirio Diaz became president in order to better comprehend this historical event. The actors really played their part reasonably very well. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Emiliano Zpata and Anthony Quinn as his brother is such that I think they deserve to be granted ""kudu's"" for their acting. But so was Jean Peters,and the one prtraying Francisco Madero and the actor who says his only friend is logic. I learned about this remarkable movie from my father.

374272,A2A2YGCSWWAF13,6303430910,Classics Collector,"[0, 2]","This was the one film I'd always wanted to see but couldn't find of Kazan/Brando.  Now that I have, I find I hadn't missed much.  It's a miss, save your effort if you are a film buff.  Perhaps the best thing about it is that it planted the seeds for Brando to make One Eyed Jacks in Mexico a few years later.Perhaps it's not fair to compare this to the two other Kazan/Brandos, Streetcar and On The Waterfront. Those are, after all, 2 of the best pieces of American Cinema ever made.  But it's difficult to watch Viva Zapata knowing the talent at hand and not seeing it flourish.  Brando gives it his all but Steinbeck's script feels flat, the production values are cheap, the supporting cast (except Anthony Quinn) is heavy handed, and the poor Mexicans are merely cutout figures.  Perhaps there is little room for improvisation here and it therefore seems stilted compared to the great films mentioned above.  My hunch is that since the script is essentially weak, Brando, in interpreting a famous figure while affecting a Spanish accent, felt less inclined to play with it, flesh it out, to get in his skin. Anthony Quinn seems to go him one better in this regard.I notice that many of the other reviews herald the film as a classic and I might be missing something here.

374274,A1F1YLNOTUEHDG,6303430910,"David A. Greene ""davidgreene52movie devotee""","[1, 1]","The last time this great motion picture was available in a home video format was something close to twenty years ago when a none too widely circulated VHS version was on the market.  As I already owned most of the film's director, Elia Kazan's works, it did not make sense for me to buy the rather pricey, but wonderful new box set of his movies which also includes this title.  I believed that I would have to continue waiting for a decent quality individual copy of ""Viva Zapata"" until I suddenly discovered this Region One edition which, from the Spanish language text on its cover, was apparently aimed at the Latin, or South American market.  Awhile back, I had actually bought a scruffy version that was packaged for some Asian country, which had its opening credits missing and was a very poor transfer of a scratchy print.  I did not know what to expect with this new edition until I got it into a player.  For such a major fan of the production, it was a relief and a joy to discover that it is an excellent copy.  Always in meticulous persuit of authenticity, Kazan chose a Mexican-born cinematographer to shoot the picture so that its location choices and the entire visual concept would ring true.  In the new DVD, the magnificently photographed black and white images seem to glisten with clarity, sparkling lighting, and rich contrast.  If you are familiar with this film, you will want to own a copy.  If you do not know it, but have any enthusiasm for great screen classics, you have a treat in store.  Although serious students of Mexican history may not entirely agree with the film's characterization of the lead figure, a still hungry young Marlon Brando is brilliant and captivating in the lead role.  The supporting cast, including Anthony Quinn are all as electrifyingly powerful as fans of Kazan would expect.  This director had a way of eliciting the most truthful and intense performances from his actors that was unsurpassed.  John Steinbeck's magnificent script, along with the unforgettable musical score that Alex North contributed to making this a truly wonderful cinematic experience.  The movie has a brilliant way of encapsulating the nature of the essential problem that Mexico suffered over decades of trying to establish a stable government, following its winning of independence from Spain.

374277,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6303430910,Dr. James Gardner,"[3, 5]","""Viva Zapata"" is one of the seminal films of the early 50s. It was nominated for 5 Oscars (Actor, Supporting Actor, Screenplay, Art, Music) and turned Anthony Quinn from a supporting player into a star. It established the young Marlon Brando as a ""legend in his own time"" (he lost the Oscar to Gary Cooper in ""High Noon"" but won the Best Actor award at Cannes), and helped make westerns the focus of the 50s in film and on TV. The success of the Actor's studio cast and crew transformed acting and film forever, and for Elia Kazan, the man who betrayed his friends in HUAC hearings, it was a partial rescue of a career that otherwise might have gone south.Emiliano Zapata (1879-1919) was a leading figure in the Mexican revolution, and the subject of a 1941 novel ""Zapata the Unconquerable"" by Edgcomb Pinchon. Novelist John Steinbeck (1902-68) adapted the novel for the screen, for which he received an Oscar nomination.FWIW - Pulitizer Prize winner and Nobel laureate Steinbeck is best known for his novels like ""Tortilla Flats"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""East of Eden"", ""Cannery Row"", ""Of Mice and Men"" - all of which were made into films but Steinbeck did not write the screenplays. His only screenplays were ""Lifeboat"" (1944) and ""A Medal for Benny"" (1945) along with ""Viva Zapata"". It was on a 1947 trip to Mexico with ""Benny"" co-writer Jack Wagner that Steinbeck got the inspiration to write the screenplay for ""Zapata"".What can you say about Marlon Brando (1924-2004), a man who literally changed the face of acting by the force of his personality in films like ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951), ""The Wild One"" (1953), and his Oscar winning performance in ""On the Waterfront"" (1954), then 20 years later won the Oscar for ""The Godfather"" (1972). He received 8 Oscar nominations, and was voted World Favorite Film Actor in 1956, 1973, and 1974. AFI lists him as #4 among ""The 50 Greatest Screen Legends"". In this film we have one of his best performances.Anthony Quinn (1915-2001) plays Zapata's brother.  In 1952 he was still a supporting player although he had been in more than 30 films and had done well in films like ""They Died with Their Boots On"" (1941) and ""Blood and Sand"" (1941) and was the son-in-law of Hollywood big shot Cecil B. de Mille. This would be his big break, earning him the first of his two Oscars. Quinn, of course, left us a great legacy of more than 100 roles, with films like ""Zorba the Greek"" (1961), ""Lust for Life"" (1956), and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962).FWIW - Quinn and Brando were good friends from their Actor Studio days, and Quinn  had followed Brandon on stage in ""Streetcar Named Desire."" To his dying day Quinn  remained jealous of Brando's success on screen. When the Oscars were announced, Quinn was in Mexico working on a film with Gary Cooper, who defeated Brando for the Oscar that night.Beautiful Jean Peters (1926-2000) plays Zapata's wife. She made about a dozen films between 1947 and 1955 including ""Captain from Castille"" (1947) and ""Niagara"" (1953).The talented Joseph Wiseman (1918-2009) plays a shadowy revolutionary. Another member of the Actor's Studio, Wiseman was active in film and TV where he had recurring roles in ""Masada"" (1981) and ""Crime Story"" (1986-8). He's best known for his portrayal of ""Dr. No"" in the Bond film (1962). This was his third film.Petite Mildred Dunnock (1901-91) was nominated for the Golden Globe as Best Supporting Actress for her role as Senora Espejo. This was her first of 3 Golden Globe nominations and she also earned 2 Oscar nominations (""Baby Doll"", ""Death of a Salesman"") and an Emmy nomination (""Death of a Salesman"").Elia Kazan started as an actor and appeared in 6 films, turning instead to directing (""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"", ""Gentlemen's Agreement"") and producing (""East of Eden"", ""A Face in the Crowd""). His otherwise distinguished career was spoiled by his role as an informer during the McCarthy era.The top grossing films in 1952 were ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", ""The Bad and the Beautiful"", ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"", ""Ivanhoe"", and ""Singing in the Rain"".  ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" won for Best Picture and other Oscar winners were ""High Noon"" (Actor), ""The Quiet Man"" (Director), and ""Come Back Little Sheeba"" (Actress). Other memorable films that year were ""Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd"", Tracy and Hepburn as ""Pet and Mike"", Fritz Lang's ""Rancho Nororious"", ""The Red Planet Mars"", ""Scaramouche"", and Marian Cooper's ""This is Cinerama"".The NY Times' Bosley Crowther called the film ""a very strong recollection"" and ""as lively a swirl of agitation as has been stirred in quite a time."" He said ""this ardent portrait of him throbs with a rare vitality, and a masterful picture of a nation in revolutionary torment has been got..."" Concerning Brando he wrote ""there is power enough in his portrayal to cause the screen to throb"" and he said ""Quinn does a dandy, raw-boned job and Joseph Wiseman is wonderfully steel-springed as a dark, vicious revolutionist.""There are lots of films about the Mexican Revolution, most of them focusing on Pancho Villa (1878-1923). Wallace Beery won an Oscar playing him in 1934 (""Viva Villa"") and other actors to play him include Leo Carrillo (""Pancho Villa Returns""), Alan Reed (""Viva Zapata""), Telly Savalas (""Pancho Villa""), Pedro Armendariz Jr. (""Old Gringo""), and Antonio Banderas (""Starring Pancho Villa""). Pedro Armendariz Sr. played him 3 times (1950, 1957, and 1960) in Mexican films. Apart from a focus on Villa, the only other film about the revolution is ""Old Gringo"" (1989).This is a major film and will appeal to almost everyone.",5,Classic film,1310947200,"07 18,

The casting was not the best  but I guess names sell movies. I know all the reviews are glowing 5 stars but I was less than convinced that Brando was Zapata. First of all that wimpy mustache has got to go. The real Zapata had a mustache for the ages.  On the other hand the actor who played Porfirio Diaz at least looked a bit like him.Brandos terrible ""Mexican accent"" made me cringe throughout the movie.  I know everyone says his acting was great but his crediblity was damaged right out the gate for me. If a movie is in English just speak English. Is the ""Mexican  accent"" supposed to make it more authentic? I don't think so. Anthony Quinn would have probably made a better Zapata but instead he was relegated to the supporting actors role. Anthony Quinn, who spoke with such fervor and eloquence throughout the movie stole many of the scenes. The script by Steinbeck was much better and the movie adaptation was loosely followed and often out of sequence. These personal observations aside I did think it was a good movie. The film is a romanticized version of Zapata(and Pancho Villa)and is full of interesting cinematography. One of my favorite scenes is when Zapata is brought into an ambush and later his lifeless body is left in town for display. As the dead Zapata lies in the plaza beneath him the water is flowing out of a pipe; the symbolism of water as the basis of life continues to flow, meanwhile the dialogue centers around how the man is not dead but will continue to live in the hearts and minds of  the people. There are many memorable moments in this classic movie that compensate for the poor but prosperous Hollywood casting. All in all it is worth seeing again and could serve well in a film study class.",4,Revolutionary spirit lives on,1049932800,"04 10, 2003",2003,1847,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'screenplay', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'recently', 'watched', 'movie', 'again', 'have', 'problems', 'casting', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'guess', 'names', 'sell', 'movies', 'know', 'reviews', 'are', 'glowing', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'less', 'convinced', 'Brando', 'was', 'Zapata', 'First', 'wimpy', 'mustache', 'got', 'go', 'real', 'Zapata', 'had', 'mustache', 'ages', 'other', 'hand', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Porfirio', 'Diaz', 'least', 'looked', 'bit', 'him.Brandos', 'terrible', 'Mexican', 'accent', 'made', 'cringe', 'movie', 'know', 'everyone', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'crediblity', 'was', 'damaged', 'right', 'gate', 'movie', 'English', 'just', 'speak', 'English', 'Mexican', 'accent', 'supposed', 'make', 'more', 'authentic', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'made', 'better', 'Zapata', 'instead', 'was', 'relegated', 'supporting', 'actors', 'role', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'who', 'spoke', 'such', 'fervor', 'eloquence', 'movie', 'stole', 'many', 'scenes', 'script', 'Steinbeck', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'was', 'loosely', 'followed', 'often', 'sequence', 'personal', 'observations', 'aside', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'film', 'romanticized', 'version', 'Zapata', 'Pancho', 'Villa', 'full', 'interesting', 'cinematography', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'when', 'Zapata', 'brought', 'ambush', 'later', 'lifeless', 'body', 'left', 'town', 'display', 'dead', 'Zapata', 'plaza', 'beneath', 'water', 'flowing', 'pipe', 'symbolism', 'water', 'basis', 'life', 'flow', 'meanwhile', 'dialogue', 'centers', 'how', 'man', 'not', 'dead', 'will', 'continue', 'live', 'hearts', 'minds', 'people', 'are', 'many', 'memorable', 'moments', 'classic', 'movie', 'compensate', 'poor', 'prosperous', 'Hollywood', 'casting', 'worth', 'seeing', 'again', 'could', 'serve', 'well', 'film', 'study', 'class']",Viva Zapata VHS
374280,A2A3VF06FR0C7D,6303430910,Frank Gibbons,"[63, 67]","I really enjoyed this film directed by Elia Kazan with a screenplay by John Steinbeck (his only credited screenplay). Their vision of the Revolution is at once both impossibly romantic as well as bitterly cynical. The romance lies in the pure-hearted desire of Emiliano Zapata to bring justice and land reform to `the people'. The cynicism is expressed in the constant betrayal and manipulation of the Revolution by men who are either weak, self-seeking, or who have absolutely no commitment to justice or to `the people. Then there is the character of Fernando, deliciously played by Joseph Wiseman, the professional revolutionary who will never be satisfied with the attainment of objectives but only in incessant foment and agitation (in real life, Kazan detested doctrinaire Stalinists). Brando gives a brooding performance as the illiterate Zapata who inwardly burns at his inability to read. Anthony Quinn won an Oscar as Zapata's older brother, Eufemio. Virtually all of the characters in `Viva Zapata' are ground down by the realities of constant struggle of revolution. We are not to have illusions about the nature of Revolutions. And yet, Kazan and Steinbeck still leave us room to believe that the ideals of revolutionary struggle in themselves can be endowed with nobility and worthiness. The cinematography by Joe MacDonald is tasteful as is the music score by Alex North.",5,A romatic yet cynical look at the nature of 'Revolution'.,999043200,"08 29, 2001",2001,1386,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'directed', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'screenplay', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'only', 'credited', 'screenplay', 'vision', 'Revolution', 'once', 'impossibly', 'romantic', 'as', 'well', 'bitterly', 'cynical', 'romance', 'pure-hearted', 'desire', 'Emiliano', 'Zapata', 'bring', 'justice', 'land', 'reform', 'people', 'cynicism', 'expressed', 'constant', 'betrayal', 'manipulation', 'Revolution', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'weak', 'self-seeking', 'who', 'have', 'absolutely', 'commitment', 'justice', 'people', 'Then', 'character', 'Fernando', 'deliciously', 'played', 'Joseph', 'Wiseman', 'professional', 'revolutionary', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'satisfied', 'attainment', 'objectives', 'only', 'incessant', 'foment', 'agitation', 'real', 'life', 'Kazan', 'detested', 'doctrinaire', 'Stalinists', 'Brando', 'brooding', 'performance', 'illiterate', 'Zapata', 'who', 'inwardly', 'inability', 'read', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Zapata', 'older', 'brother', 'Eufemio', 'Virtually', 'characters', 'Viva', 'Zapata', 'are', 'ground', 'down', 'realities', 'constant', 'struggle', 'revolution', 'are', 'not', 'have', 'illusions', 'nature', 'Revolutions', 'yet', 'Kazan', 'Steinbeck', 'still', 'leave', 'room', 'believe', 'ideals', 'revolutionary', 'struggle', 'can', 'be', 'endowed', 'nobility', 'worthiness', 'cinematography', 'Joe', 'MacDonald', 'tasteful', 'music', 'score', 'Alex', 'North']",Viva Zapata VHS

As I read more and more on the subject my appreciation of this movie increases.It presents the viewer with a big fresco of the Revolution that convulsed that country for more than ten years.I admire the strange capacity of the film to show condensed in each scene, many key issues of why and how the Revolution exploded and continue growing along the years, with an immitigable fire.Director Elia Kazan has been criticized for his appearance on the Un-American Activities Committee that lead many people related to cinematography to be ostracized.This been said, regardless of his political stand, he had directed many great Oscar winner films as: ""Gentleman's Agreement"" (1947), ""Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951); ""East of Eden"" (1955); ""Splendor on the Grass"" (1961) and the present ""Viva Zapata!"" (1952).He had directed two ""Movie Icons"" as Marlon Brando (more than once) and James Dean obtaining the best from them. All his films explored the inner depth of human soul with unflinching stare.Since the first shot, showing a very accurate characterization of President Porfirio Diaz (Fay Roope) and giving an inkling of the type of ruler he was, an enormous gallery of Mexican historical figure are made known.Francisco Madero's (Harold Gordon) personality and idealistic navet&eacute; is depicted with very few strokes.Huerta's (Frank Silvera) wickedness and treachery is shown too.Above all of them Emiliano Zapata's figure impersonated by an inspired Marlon Brando stands with an epic height. His ideals, stubbornness, charisma and internal sorrows leading him to the final sacrifice, are shown convincingly.A special mention must be done of Anthony Quinn's superb performance, which entitled him to win the Oscar. He not only has the physique du role, but an internal conviction to give flesh to Eufemio, Zapata's brother, a semi cultured and brave centaur, product of his times and environment.Josefa (Jean Peters) the fianc&eacute;e and later wife of Emiliano shows all the traits of a high middle class woman romantically requested by a rural hero. The scene played with Brando in the church's atrium is wonderful.The only character that gives a discordant note is the fictional Fernando, representing an addict to revolution for revolution in itself.Joseph MacDonald's black and white photography is very beautiful. Steinbeck's screenplay has a solid internal coherence that shows all along the film.A Classic Movie not diminished by the more than fifty years passed.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",5,A huge fresco of Mexican Revolution.,1082851200,"04 25, 2004",2004,2653,"['Actually', 'was', 'film', 'triggered', 'interest', 'Mexican', 'Revolution.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'always', 'found', 'new', 'details', 'take', 'account', 'read', 'more', 'more', 'subject', 'appreciation', 'movie', 'increases.It', 'viewer', 'big', 'fresco', 'Revolution', 'convulsed', 'country', 'more', 'ten', 'years.I', 'admire', 'strange', 'capacity', 'film', 'show', 'condensed', 'scene', 'many', 'key', 'issues', 'why', 'how', 'Revolution', 'exploded', 'continue', 'growing', 'years', 'immitigable', 'fire.Director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'been', 'criticized', 'appearance', 'Un-American', 'Activities', 'Committee', 'lead', 'many', 'people', 'related', 'cinematography', 'be', 'ostracized.This', 'been', 'said', 'regardless', 'political', 'stand', 'had', 'directed', 'many', 'great', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'films', 'Gentleman', 'Agreement', '1947', 'Streetcar', 'Named', 'Desire', '1951', 'East', 'Eden', '1955', 'Splendor', 'Grass', '1961', 'present', 'Viva', 'Zapata', '1952', '.He', 'had', 'directed', 'two', 'Movie', 'Icons', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'more', 'once', 'James', 'Dean', 'obtaining', 'best', 'films', 'explored', 'inner', 'depth', 'human', 'soul', 'unflinching', 'stare.Since', 'first', 'shot', 'showing', 'very', 'accurate', 'characterization', 'President', 'Porfirio', 'Diaz', 'Fay', 'Roope', 'giving', 'inkling', 'type', 'ruler', 'was', 'enormous', 'gallery', 'Mexican', 'historical', 'figure', 'are', 'made', 'known.Francisco', 'Madero', 'Harold', 'Gordon', 'personality', 'idealistic', 'navet', 'eacute', 'depicted', 'very', 'few', 'strokes.Huerta', 'Frank', 'Silvera', 'wickedness', 'treachery', 'shown', 'Emiliano', 'Zapata', 'figure', 'impersonated', 'inspired', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'epic', 'height', 'ideals', 'stubbornness', 'charisma', 'internal', 'sorrows', 'leading', 'final', 'sacrifice', 'are', 'shown', 'convincingly.A', 'special', 'mention', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'superb', 'performance', 'entitled', 'win', 'Oscar', 'not', 'only', 'physique', 'du', 'role', 'internal', 'conviction', 'give', 'flesh', 'Eufemio', 'Zapata', 'brother', 'semi', 'cultured', 'brave', 'centaur', 'product', 'times', 'environment.Josefa', 'Jean', 'Peters', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'later', 'wife', 'Emiliano', 'traits', 'high', 'middle', 'class', 'woman', 'romantically', 'requested', 'rural', 'hero', 'scene', 'played', 'Brando', 'church', 'atrium', 'wonderful.The', 'only', 'character', 'discordant', 'note', 'fictional', 'Fernando', 'representing', 'addict', 'revolution', 'revolution', 'itself.Joseph', 'MacDonald', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'very', 'beautiful', 'Steinbeck', 'screenplay', 'solid', 'internal', 'coherence', 'film.A', 'Classic', 'Movie', 'not', 'diminished', 'more', 'fifty', 'years', 'passed.Reviewed', 'Max', 'Yofre']",Viva Zapata VHS

Also, Steinbeck took great care to research and emulate the locations and manner of the Mexican peasants in Southern Mexico. For all of its American actors, it really has a Mexican feel to it, from the dozens of tiny details of behavior to the dress and background. I played this for my college students, most of whom think any old movie was made after 1970, and they were fully engaged in their attention and discussion afterward. (I play this with ""The Ox-Bow Incident"" and ""Bad Day at Black Rock"" for similar reasons--all get an rousing A from the students!)

374297,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6303430910,Robert Morris,"[18, 21]","Directed by Elia Kazan, this film focuses on the revolutionary initiatives of Emiliano Zapata (Brando) who was born on August 8, 1879, in Anenecuilco, Morelos. He was a mediero (sharecropper) and horse trainer, conscripted into the army for seven years attaining the rank of sergeant. As president of the village council, he campaigned for the restoration of village lands confiscated by hacendados. His slogan was &quot;Tierra y Libertad.&quot; Zapata sided with Don Francisco Madero (Harold Gordon). Between 1910 and 1919, Zapata continued his fight for land and liberty, rebelling against anyone who interfered with his Plan of Ayala which called for the seizure of all foreign owned land, all land taken from villages, confiscation of one-third of all land held by &quot;friendly&quot; hacendados and full confiscation of land owned by persons opposed to the Plan of Ayala. On April 10, 1919, Zapata was tricked into a meeting with one of Venustiano Carranza's generals who wanted to &quot;switch sides.&quot; The meeting was a trap, and Zapata was killed as he arrived at the meeting.When writing the screenplay, John Steinbeck took several liberties with these and other historical facts to serve the interests of the film's narrative. Nonetheless, I am fascinated by Brando's portrayal of Zapata and intrigued by Kazan's association with a film so unrelated to his work on stage and film before or since. There are several memorable moments. My personal favorites are when the captured Zapata is led through the countryside by captors who eventually release him (for reasons best revealed in the film), when he later approaches Josefa Espejo (Jean Peters) and her family during a church service, and later when he is gunned down in a village square. The supporting cast is first-rate. Anthony Quinn received his first Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role as Eufemio Zapata, the other for his portrayal of Paul Gaugin in Lust for Life. The performances by Gordon, Joseph Wiseman (Fernando Aguirre), Frank Silvera (General Victoriano Huerta), and Arnold Moss (Don Nacio) are also noteworthy. As for Peters, she was given little to work with and did the best she could with it. I wish Kazan and Steinbeck had developed her character in much greater depth.Brando's is a studied, subdued portrayal of an essentially simple man with a few basic principles. His Zapata is a reluctant but (when necessary) passionate leader of oppressed people. After seeing Viva Zapata! again recently, I again wondered what Kazan's primary objective was when he agreed to direct it. (Comparisons with On the Waterfront are inevitable.) I continue to think about this film and, as of now, am as yet undecided as to its meaning and, especially, its significance.",4,The Reluctant (Mythic) Hero,1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,2757,"['Directed', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'film', 'revolutionary', 'initiatives', 'Emiliano', 'Zapata', 'Brando', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'August', '8', '1879', 'Anenecuilco', 'Morelos', 'was', 'mediero', 'sharecropper', 'horse', 'trainer', 'conscripted', 'army', 'seven', 'years', 'attaining', 'rank', 'sergeant', 'president', 'village', 'council', 'campaigned', 'restoration', 'village', 'lands', 'confiscated', 'hacendados', 'slogan', 'was', 'quot', 'Tierra', 'y', 'Libertad.', 'quot', 'Zapata', 'sided', 'Don', 'Francisco', 'Madero', 'Harold', 'Gordon', 'Between', '1910', '1919', 'Zapata', 'continued', 'fight', 'land', 'liberty', 'rebelling', 'anyone', 'who', 'interfered', 'Plan', 'Ayala', 'called', 'seizure', 'foreign', 'owned', 'land', 'land', 'taken', 'villages', 'confiscation', 'one-third', 'land', 'held', 'quot', 'friendly', 'quot', 'hacendados', 'full', 'confiscation', 'land', 'owned', 'persons', 'opposed', 'Plan', 'Ayala', 'April', '10', '1919', 'Zapata', 'was', 'tricked', 'meeting', 'one', 'Venustiano', 'Carranza', 'generals', 'who', 'wanted', 'quot', 'switch', 'sides.', 'quot', 'meeting', 'was', 'trap', 'Zapata', 'was', 'killed', 'arrived', 'meeting.When', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'took', 'several', 'liberties', 'other', 'historical', 'facts', 'serve', 'interests', 'film', 'narrative', 'Nonetheless', 'am', 'fascinated', 'Brando', 'portrayal', 'Zapata', 'intrigued', 'Kazan', 'association', 'film', 'so', 'unrelated', 'work', 'stage', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'memorable', 'moments', 'personal', 'favorites', 'are', 'when', 'captured', 'Zapata', 'led', 'countryside', 'captors', 'who', 'eventually', 'release', 'reasons', 'best', 'revealed', 'film', 'when', 'later', 'Josefa', 'Espejo', 'Jean', 'Peters', 'family', 'church', 'service', 'later', 'when', 'gunned', 'down', 'village', 'square', 'supporting', 'cast', 'first-rate', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'received', 'first', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Supporting', 'Role', 'Eufemio', 'Zapata', 'other', 'portrayal', 'Paul', 'Gaugin', 'Lust', 'Life', 'performances', 'Gordon', 'Joseph', 'Wiseman', 'Fernando', 'Aguirre', 'Frank', 'Silvera', 'General', 'Victoriano', 'Huerta', 'Arnold', 'Moss', 'Don', 'Nacio', 'are', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'Peters', 'was', 'given', 'little', 'work', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'wish', 'Kazan', 'Steinbeck', 'had', 'developed', 'character', 'much', 'greater', 'depth.Brando', 'studied', 'subdued', 'portrayal', 'essentially', 'simple', 'man', 'few', 'basic', 'principles', 'Zapata', 'reluctant', 'when', 'necessary', 'passionate', 'leader', 'oppressed', 'people', 'seeing', 'Viva', 'Zapata', 'again', 'recently', 'again', 'wondered', 'what', 'Kazan', 'primary', 'objective', 'was', 'when', 'agreed', 'direct', 'Comparisons', 'Waterfront', 'are', 'inevitable', 'continue', 'think', 'film', 'now', 'am', 'yet', 'undecided', 'meaning', 'especially', 'significance']",Viva Zapata VHS

374299,ACM90BRKX73OG,6303430910,Tom,"[3, 5]","Viva Zapata (20th Century Fox, 1952) was director Elia Kazan's eighth film.A group of Mexican peasants petitions dictator President Diaz for land reform. The patronizing Diaz notes the insolence of one particular individual, Emilio Zapata (Marlon Brando). Zapata grows in stature as a leader of the people with his spirited brother, Eufemio (Anthony Quinn), at his side. His peasant army joins in the Mexican Revolution of 1910 to overthrow Diaz and install liberal reformer Madero as president. As Zapata's fame and influence rises he marries Josefa (Jean Peters), the daughter of a rich merchant. Impatient with the well-meaning but befuddled Madero, Zapata continues the fight for agrarian reform. Madero is felled in a coup led by General Huerta. Zapata and the the other rebel generals eventually drive Huerta into exile. Zapata is appointed president of Mexico but quickly resigns in frustration. Mexico's new rulers, former revolutionaries, hunt down Zapata, eventually killing him in an ambush. Journalist, Fernando Aguirre (Joseph Wiseman), a shadowy figure and advisor to Zapata and other revolutionary leaders, has a hand in Zapata's death.Brando gives a solid performance as the rebel general but Quinn is even better, winning an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Lovely Jean Peters is quite fetching as Zapata's wife even though Kazan criticized her performance in later interviews. What a doll. John Steinbeck wrote the script for this romanticized account and was nominated for an Oscar. However, the closing scene with the riderless white horse, as cliched an ending as you can possibly imagine, was suggested by producer Darryl F. Zanuck. The story does not flow easily and you'll need a scorecard to keep track of all of the politicos. First, the bad guy is Diaz. Then it's Madero. Then Huerta. Then Carranza. Ay, caramba! Also, it may be quibbling but Brando's eye make-up is distracting.Viva Zapata was Kazan's thinly veiled indictment of Stalinism, a cure that was worse than the disease. Kazan, a former communist who quit the party in 1936, was called to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1952 where he named names of former party members earning for himself the undying wrath of liberals. Kazan would continue his critique of communism in Man On A Tightrope (1953) and On The Waterfront (1954).Viva Zapata is not sold as an individual DVD in the USA however it is included as one of the fifteen films in the Elia Kazan Collection box set. Unfortunately, commentary is not provided. Viva Zapata is not one of Kazan's best films but it has some very enjoyable scenes and performances.",4,Kazan tells story of Mexican revolutionary,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,2642,"['Viva', 'Zapata', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', '1952', 'was', 'director', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'eighth', 'film.A', 'group', 'Mexican', 'peasants', 'petitions', 'dictator', 'President', 'Diaz', 'land', 'reform', 'patronizing', 'Diaz', 'insolence', 'one', 'particular', 'individual', 'Emilio', 'Zapata', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Zapata', 'stature', 'leader', 'people', 'spirited', 'brother', 'Eufemio', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'side', 'peasant', 'army', 'Mexican', 'Revolution', '1910', 'overthrow', 'Diaz', 'install', 'liberal', 'reformer', 'Madero', 'president', 'Zapata', 'fame', 'influence', 'rises', 'Josefa', 'Jean', 'Peters', 'daughter', 'rich', 'merchant', 'Impatient', 'well-meaning', 'befuddled', 'Madero', 'Zapata', 'fight', 'agrarian', 'reform', 'Madero', 'felled', 'coup', 'led', 'General', 'Huerta', 'Zapata', 'other', 'rebel', 'generals', 'eventually', 'drive', 'Huerta', 'exile', 'Zapata', 'appointed', 'president', 'Mexico', 'quickly', 'resigns', 'frustration', 'Mexico', 'new', 'rulers', 'former', 'revolutionaries', 'hunt', 'down', 'Zapata', 'eventually', 'killing', 'ambush', 'Journalist', 'Fernando', 'Aguirre', 'Joseph', 'Wiseman', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'advisor', 'Zapata', 'other', 'revolutionary', 'leaders', 'hand', 'Zapata', 'death.Brando', 'solid', 'performance', 'rebel', 'general', 'Quinn', 'even', 'better', 'winning', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Lovely', 'Jean', 'Peters', 'quite', 'fetching', 'Zapata', 'wife', 'even', 'Kazan', 'criticized', 'performance', 'later', 'interviews', 'What', 'doll', 'John', 'Steinbeck', 'wrote', 'script', 'romanticized', 'account', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'However', 'closing', 'scene', 'riderless', 'white', 'horse', 'cliched', 'ending', 'can', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'was', 'suggested', 'producer', 'Darryl', 'F.', 'Zanuck', 'story', 'not', 'flow', 'easily', ""'ll"", 'need', 'scorecard', 'keep', 'track', 'politicos', 'First', 'bad', 'guy', 'Diaz', 'Then', 'Madero', 'Then', 'Huerta', 'Then', 'Carranza', 'Ay', 'caramba', 'Also', 'may', 'be', 'quibbling', 'Brando', 'eye', 'make-up', 'distracting.Viva', 'Zapata', 'was', 'Kazan', 'thinly', 'veiled', 'indictment', 'Stalinism', 'cure', 'was', 'worse', 'disease', 'Kazan', 'former', 'communist', 'who', 'quit', 'party', '1936', 'was', 'called', 'appear', 'House', 'Committee', 'Un-American', 'Activities', '1952', 'where', 'named', 'names', 'former', 'party', 'members', 'earning', 'undying', 'wrath', 'liberals', 'Kazan', 'would', 'continue', 'critique', 'communism', 'Man', 'A', 'Tightrope', '1953', 'Waterfront', '1954', '.Viva', 'Zapata', 'not', 'sold', 'individual', 'DVD', 'USA', 'however', 'included', 'one', 'fifteen', 'films', 'Elia', 'Kazan', 'Collection', 'box', 'set', 'Unfortunately', 'commentary', 'not', 'provided', 'Viva', 'Zapata', 'not', 'one', 'Kazan', 'best', 'films', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'scenes', 'performances']",Viva Zapata VHS
