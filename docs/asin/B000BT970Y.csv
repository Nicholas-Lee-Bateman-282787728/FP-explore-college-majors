949256,AUW8TCRK9EDQ6,B000BT970Y,Andre LeBlanc,"[1, 2]","The most important thing people need to know about this film is that it is a spinoff of the other American Pie films.  Only two characters return from the first three movies.  Jim's dad and Sherman (""The Shermanator"") return as counselors.  Oddly enough, both flop and have no where near the appeal they had in the previous installments.  Fortunately, they don't have enough airtime to really hurt the film either.This movie focuses on the character Matt Stifler, younger brother of Steve Stifler (from the previous American Pie films).  He is sent to band camp as punishment for a practical joke he committed.  He purchases a bunch of spy equipment in an effort to film a ""Girls Gone Wild"" style video of the band geeks (we find out his older brother has become famous doing this).  He ends up falling in love with one of the band girls and ultimately becomes a good guy.Not surprisingly, the plot has worn rather thin.  This was already evident in American Wedding and only got worse this time around.  However, that said, I found the movie to be rather entertaining and charming.  It has enough gags to entertain us guys and has a genuine love story to appeal to girls.  Personally, I enjoyed both aspects.  However, I truly hope this is the end of the series.",3,"Entertaining Enough, But....",1142380800,"03 15, 2006",2006,1263,"['most', 'important', 'thing', 'people', 'need', 'know', 'film', 'spinoff', 'other', 'American', 'Pie', 'films', 'Only', 'two', 'characters', 'return', 'first', 'three', 'movies', 'Jim', 'dad', 'Sherman', 'Shermanator', 'return', 'counselors', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'flop', 'have', 'where', 'appeal', 'had', 'previous', 'installments', 'Fortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'airtime', 'really', 'hurt', 'film', 'either.This', 'movie', 'character', 'Matt', 'Stifler', 'younger', 'brother', 'Steve', 'Stifler', 'previous', 'American', 'Pie', 'films', 'sent', 'band', 'camp', 'punishment', 'practical', 'joke', 'committed', 'purchases', 'bunch', 'spy', 'equipment', 'effort', 'film', 'Girls', 'Gone', 'Wild', 'style', 'video', 'band', 'geeks', 'find', 'out', 'older', 'brother', 'become', 'famous', 'doing', 'up', 'falling', 'love', 'one', 'band', 'girls', 'ultimately', 'good', 'guy.Not', 'surprisingly', 'plot', 'worn', 'rather', 'thin', 'was', 'already', 'evident', 'American', 'Wedding', 'only', 'got', 'worse', 'time', 'around', 'However', 'said', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'charming', 'enough', 'gags', 'entertain', 'guys', 'genuine', 'love', 'story', 'appeal', 'girls', 'Personally', 'enjoyed', 'aspects', 'However', 'truly', 'hope', 'end', 'series']",N/A
949257,A200C7YQJ45LRR,B000BT970Y,"Anthony Rupert ""shut up, Shut Up, SHUT UP!!!""","[0, 5]","***SPOILER ALERT***Unlike a lot of people, I actually liked American Pie 2 more than the original American Pie (although the original is what brought the word ""milf"" into the American lexicon). But American Wedding was pretty okay; not only had most of the jokes already run their course (especially the scenes with Stifler's mom or ANYthing Stifler-related), but most of the main cast weren't even in the movie. The latter aspect is also evident in the straight-to-video release Band Camp.I see where other reviewers are coming from when they say that this movie feels more like a spin-off (or maybe a crossover) than a sequel, and I also think that Sarah Borkowski's review is pretty on-point. This movie introduces Tad Hilgenbrinck as Steve Stifler's younger brother Matt Stifler, and that alone shows a continuity errors: in the first two movies, Steve's brother's name was never mentioned; plus, he was played by Eli Marienthal. I think Tad only got the job because he looks so much like Seann William Scott. Before I forget, though, here's a forewarning to the guys: if all you're looking for in this movie is gratuitous nudity, you won't find it here. In fact, you see more of Tad's a** than anything else.Anyway, on to the movie. Matt and his pals are planning to prank the band geeks at his high school because Matt wants badly to follow in his brother's footsteps. The latest prank has him sent to see the guidance counselor, who turns out to be Chuck ""The Shermanator"" Sherman (Chris Owen). You can tell that that role was meant to give a ""my, how the tables have turned"" appeal, but I don't know; it just didn't do anything for me. Anyway, Sherman sends Matt to band camp for the summer.Upon arriving at band camp, we meet the only real saving grace to this movie: Jim's dad, Mr. Levinstein, as the head counselor (Eugene Levy is ALWAYS funny, so that's no surprise). Matt also meets his childhood crush, Elyse Houston (played by Arielle Kebbel -- quite a step up from Soul Plane, isn't it?), and she reminds him that he was a sweet guy until he started trying to be like his brother.After, say, halfway into the movie, it seems like things will get better, but then everything plays out almost exactly like what happened in American Wedding. Stifler's annoying pranks are good for a few laughs, but then he screws up so bad that even the audience at home thinks he's a jerk; then he finally realizes the error of his ways and fixes things up for the girl of his dreams just before the credits roll.Even a veteran porn star (Ginger Lynn Allen) and a pair of Playboy Playmates (Rachel Veltri and Angela Little) do little to add interest to this movie. Like the case with American Wedding, Band Camp is only worth buying to complete your American Pie collection.Anthony Rupert",3,MY 666th REVIEW?

949258,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000BT970Y,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 6]","""American Pie Presents Band Camp"" is what would of happened to the original film if it hadn't of had a good writer(which it did with Adam Herz), likeable and relatable characters(which it did), and genuine depth and heart(which it did). This film pretty much tries to follow the original series' formula, but it doesn't really achieve any of those things above. I will say that I liked it more than I thought I would. If it hadn't been for the returning Eugene Levy(and he is in demand as an actor judging by how he always pops up - another reviewer should pay more attention), I wouldn't of been nearly as interested. As far as direct to video goes, it's better than others of it's kind I've seen. But first, the plot. Stifler's little brother Matt(Tad Hilgenbrick)is a cjip off the old block. In ways, he seems even more annoying than big bro. He is caught in the act of a prank and is sent to the guidance councelor(The Sherminator!)and for punishment is sent to band camp. But Stifler Jr. being who he is, he has a raunchy plan. He sets up cameras all over the place and plans to make a raunchy video called ""Bandeez Gone Wild"", and follow in big bro's footsteps. However, he didn't plan on falling in love with Elyse(Arielle Kebell), but we did!. The film also has the expected and cliched ""big tournament"" that our main stars try to win and beat their rivals who have won it year after year. Yawn. The idea for the movie works for the kind of ""spin off"" that this is, but it wouldn't of for a regular part 4. Hilgenbrick is one of the more redeeming qualities here. He is a bit annoying and does take it a little too far sometimes, but he has the Stifler speak down pat, as well as the looks and mannerisms. He has definitley studied Sean William Scott. Kibbell is a lovely thing to look at, but nothing else is going on. Levy delivers as Jiim's dad, but he's not as funny here as he was in the others. But his appearance adds some credibility to the proceedings that the film would otherwise be lacking. Former porn star Ginger Lynn Allen appears as the camp nurse, and comedic character actor Timothy Stack(""Night Stand"", ""Son Of The Beach"")also appears. The film has the raunch down, but the comedy is on a low. There isn't a whole lot to laugh at here. Most of what we see we have seen before. None of the characters are likeable, except maybe Elyse, and none are that relatable. Something that was a key ingredient in the three previous films. The movie tries to have heart, and maybe it has some, but it is not as real, deep, or authentic as any in the other films. It falls flat and seems too rushed for it to be effective. The raunch factor is pretty high. There is more nudity in this film than in any of the others. You'll be in for a treat if you like that sort of thing. I knew going in that this would not be a high mark in the ""Pie"" series, and the film supported my thought. The extras are so so. Some deleted scenes and outtakes, and some time behind the scenes with the crew and the camp girls. A music video of the girls is included as well. Even ""American Wedding"", which is considered the least in the series, is ten times funnier than this one. Jim's dad mentioned that Jim and Michelle were having a baby. That's the movie we need to see in this series. Not wasting our time with the little Jr.'s. We need the real gang back.",2,One Slice Too Many,1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,3353,"['American', 'Pie', 'Presents', 'Band', 'Camp', 'what', 'would', 'happened', 'original', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'good', 'writer', 'did', 'Adam', 'Herz', 'likeable', 'relatable', 'characters', 'did', 'genuine', 'depth', 'heart', 'did', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'tries', 'follow', 'original', 'series', 'formula', ""n't"", 'really', 'achieve', 'things', 'will', 'say', 'liked', 'more', 'thought', 'would', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'returning', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'demand', 'actor', 'judging', 'how', 'always', 'up', 'reviewer', 'should', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'would', ""n't"", 'been', 'nearly', 'as', 'interested', 'As', 'far', 'direct', 'video', 'better', 'others', 'kind', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'first', 'plot', 'Stifler', 'little', 'brother', 'Matt', 'Tad', 'Hilgenbrick', 'cjip', 'old', 'block', 'ways', 'even', 'more', 'annoying', 'big', 'bro', 'caught', 'act', 'prank', 'sent', 'guidance', 'councelor', 'Sherminator', 'punishment', 'sent', 'band', 'camp', 'Stifler', 'Jr.', 'being', 'who', 'raunchy', 'plan', 'up', 'cameras', 'place', 'plans', 'make', 'raunchy', 'video', 'called', 'Bandeez', 'Gone', 'Wild', 'follow', 'big', 'bro', 'footsteps', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'plan', 'falling', 'love', 'Elyse', 'Arielle', 'Kebell', 'did', 'film', 'also', 'expected', 'cliched', 'big', 'tournament', 'main', 'stars', 'try', 'win', 'beat', 'rivals', 'who', 'have', 'won', 'year', 'year', 'Yawn', 'idea', 'movie', 'kind', 'spin', 'off', 'would', ""n't"", 'regular', 'part', '4', 'Hilgenbrick', 'one', 'more', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'here', 'bit', 'annoying', 'take', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'sometimes', 'Stifler', 'speak', 'down', 'pat', 'as', 'well', 'looks', 'mannerisms', 'definitley', 'studied', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'Kibbell', 'lovely', 'thing', 'look', 'nothing', 'else', 'going', 'Levy', 'delivers', 'Jiim', 'dad', 'not', 'funny', 'here', 'was', 'others', 'appearance', 'credibility', 'proceedings', 'film', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'lacking', 'Former', 'porn', 'star', 'Ginger', 'Lynn', 'Allen', 'camp', 'nurse', 'comedic', 'character', 'actor', 'Timothy', 'Stack', 'Night', 'Stand', 'Son', 'Beach', 'also', 'film', 'raunch', 'down', 'comedy', 'low', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'laugh', 'here', 'Most', 'what', 'see', 'have', 'seen', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'maybe', 'Elyse', 'none', 'are', 'relatable', 'Something', 'was', 'key', 'ingredient', 'three', 'previous', 'films', 'movie', 'have', 'heart', 'maybe', 'not', 'real', 'deep', 'authentic', 'other', 'films', 'flat', 'too', 'rushed', 'be', 'effective', 'raunch', 'factor', 'pretty', 'high', 'more', 'nudity', 'film', 'others', ""'ll"", 'be', 'treat', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'knew', 'going', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'high', 'mark', 'Pie', 'series', 'film', 'supported', 'thought', 'extras', 'are', 'so', 'so', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'time', 'scenes', 'crew', 'camp', 'girls', 'music', 'video', 'girls', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'Even', 'American', 'Wedding', 'considered', 'least', 'series', 'ten', 'times', 'funnier', 'one', 'Jim', 'dad', 'mentioned', 'Jim', 'Michelle', 'were', 'having', 'baby', 'movie', 'need', 'see', 'series', 'Not', 'wasting', 'time', 'little', 'Jr.', 'need', 'real', 'gang', 'back']",N/A

Although it did manage to get some of those gross out jokes in there.Really, the only thing that keeps this movie down is the fact that they weren't given a very big budget. For the amount of money that they had to make this, I think they did a very good job and the mostly original cast managed to be funny, relatable, appealing and should be commended for delivering a worthy addition to the series.The movie revolves around Stiffler's brother Matt, played by Tad Hilgenbrink, who is trying to live up to his brothers reputation by making a peeping Tom video while being forced to go to Band Camp as a punishment for tormenting the Band.The Band's leader, Elyse, played by Arielle Kebbel, was also a nice addition to the American Pie women.

949265,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000BT970Y,Dorrie Wheeler,"[8, 20]","There is a new film in the American Pie family of films. American Pie Presents Band Camp is the latest film in the series. The film follows the misadventures of Matt Stifler, the younger brother of Steve Stifler, who obviously is a character from the other movies. I mention it this way because for the viewer who has never seen any of the previous movies, they only hear about this Steve Stifler who is not seen on screen but does send his brother an oft colored post card. Obviously, Steve was a Ferris Bueller type, an infamous prankster and well known by the ladies.Matt wants to follow in the family business of filming scantilly clad women in that Girls Gone Wild kind of way. He plays a prank on the school band on graduation day and the guidance counselor ""sentences"" him to band camp. This is a rather strange punishment considering Matt doesn't even play any instrument.When he arrives at band camp, Matt actually is a true thorn in the side to his fellow school band camp members. They take band camp and the point system seriously and to Matt it's all a big joke. He sets up his hidden cameras to secretly video tape the band camp girls. Matt is involved in one hilarious situation after another from the cliche situation of getting caught with no clothes on after he is tricked by some girls to having a hat glued to his head. It's a really fun film although it's different than the other American Pie movies. None of the original cast members, with the exception of Eugene Levy (Jim's Dad) appear in Band Camp. The relatively unknown ensemble cast carry the film well. The casting is good in the sense that Tad Hilgenbrinck, who portrays the character Matt, does look a lot like Seann William Scott who originated the role of Steve Stifler. There is a supporting character named Chloe (actress Crystal Lightning) who plays a band camp member who is the object of Matt's roomates affection. Her casting is a bit off because she looks like a tad bit to old to play a high school student. Arielle Kebbel best known for her recurring role as Lindsay on Gilmore Girls is the female lead in the movie.Overall, American Pie Presents Band Camp is a real winner. The film is enjoyable from start to finish. Although the film is about high school students it is a bit raunchy and includes strong language, shower scene nudity and mature situations.",5,"Totally Engaging, A Great Flick",1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,2352,"['new', 'film', 'American', 'Pie', 'family', 'films', 'American', 'Pie', 'Presents', 'Band', 'Camp', 'latest', 'film', 'series', 'film', 'misadventures', 'Matt', 'Stifler', 'younger', 'brother', 'Steve', 'Stifler', 'who', 'obviously', 'character', 'other', 'movies', 'mention', 'way', 'viewer', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'previous', 'movies', 'only', 'hear', 'Steve', 'Stifler', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'screen', 'send', 'brother', 'oft', 'colored', 'post', 'card', 'Obviously', 'Steve', 'was', 'Ferris', 'Bueller', 'type', 'infamous', 'prankster', 'well', 'known', 'ladies.Matt', 'follow', 'family', 'business', 'filming', 'scantilly', 'clad', 'women', 'Girls', 'Gone', 'Wild', 'kind', 'way', 'prank', 'school', 'band', 'graduation', 'day', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'sentences', 'band', 'camp', 'rather', 'strange', 'punishment', 'considering', 'Matt', ""n't"", 'even', 'play', 'instrument.When', 'band', 'camp', 'Matt', 'actually', 'true', 'thorn', 'side', 'fellow', 'school', 'band', 'camp', 'members', 'take', 'band', 'camp', 'point', 'system', 'seriously', 'Matt', 'big', 'joke', 'up', 'hidden', 'cameras', 'secretly', 'video', 'tape', 'band', 'camp', 'girls', 'Matt', 'involved', 'one', 'hilarious', 'situation', 'cliche', 'situation', 'getting', 'caught', 'clothes', 'tricked', 'girls', 'having', 'hat', 'glued', 'head', 'really', 'fun', 'film', 'different', 'other', 'American', 'Pie', 'movies', 'None', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'exception', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'Jim', 'Dad', 'appear', 'Band', 'Camp', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'carry', 'film', 'well', 'casting', 'good', 'sense', 'Tad', 'Hilgenbrinck', 'who', 'character', 'Matt', 'look', 'lot', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'who', 'originated', 'role', 'Steve', 'Stifler', 'supporting', 'character', 'named', 'Chloe', 'actress', 'Crystal', 'Lightning', 'who', 'band', 'camp', 'member', 'who', 'object', 'Matt', 'roomates', 'affection', 'casting', 'bit', 'off', 'tad', 'bit', 'old', 'play', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'best', 'known', 'recurring', 'role', 'Lindsay', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'female', 'lead', 'movie.Overall', 'American', 'Pie', 'Presents', 'Band', 'Camp', 'real', 'winner', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'start', 'finish', 'film', 'about', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'bit', 'raunchy', 'strong', 'language', 'shower', 'scene', 'nudity', 'mature', 'situations']",N/A
949266,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,B000BT970Y,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[0, 0]","IF you like the previous AMERICAN PIE movies, you will probably like this one.  However, you will likely not enjoy it as much as the previous ones.  For what it is, it's OK.  Not fantastic, just OK.What the movie lacks is the dynamic of the previous AP flicks.  This next generation of AP does not feature the calibre of actors such as Tara Reid, Alyson Hannigan and Seann William Scott.  There are a few tie-in actors from the previous AP, but only in bit parts.The worst idea was to have some actor (not Seann William Scott) stand-in for Stiffler.  This scene was totally unnecessary and superfluous.  Not sure whose idea it was, but you can't fool people into thinking that someone else is capable of playing Stiffler.  Scott has shown himself to have a screen presence that is out of the league of everyone in this farce.Of course, the whole premise of the movie does not help matters.  To say that the plot is silly would be an understatement.  That's not to say that the plot of the previous 3 could rival Shakespeare, but this one was the weakest of the 4.The biggest saving grace of the film is the eye-candy drum-major, Arielle Kebbel.  She is beautiful as the wholesome midwestern girl-next door (complete with integrity!).  I fell in love with her about 10 minutes into the movie!  She also has a genuine acting talent and I hope to see much more of her.  Sadly, she's one of the few girls in the film who doesn't take her shirt off (hate it when that happens!).If you're a die-hard AP fan, you may as well see this one.  Some of the pranks are recycled or @ least variations of the predecessors.  Also, the special features on this one are LAME.  Still, it's just barely watchable if the party movie genre is your thing.",2,Stale pie,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,1732,"['like', 'previous', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'movies', 'will', 'probably', 'one', 'However', 'will', 'likely', 'not', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'previous', 'ones', 'what', 'OK.', 'Not', 'fantastic', 'just', 'movie', 'dynamic', 'previous', 'AP', 'flicks', 'next', 'generation', 'AP', 'not', 'feature', 'calibre', 'actors', 'such', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'Alyson', 'Hannigan', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'are', 'few', 'tie-in', 'actors', 'previous', 'AP', 'only', 'bit', 'parts.The', 'worst', 'idea', 'was', 'have', 'actor', 'not', 'Seann', 'William', 'Scott', 'stand-in', 'Stiffler', 'scene', 'was', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'superfluous', 'Not', 'sure', 'idea', 'was', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fool', 'people', 'thinking', 'someone', 'else', 'capable', 'playing', 'Stiffler', 'Scott', 'shown', 'have', 'screen', 'presence', 'league', 'everyone', 'farce.Of', 'course', 'whole', 'premise', 'movie', 'not', 'help', 'matters', 'say', 'plot', 'silly', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'not', 'say', 'plot', 'previous', '3', 'could', 'rival', 'Shakespeare', 'one', 'was', 'weakest', '4.The', 'biggest', 'saving', 'grace', 'film', 'eye-candy', 'drum-major', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'beautiful', 'wholesome', 'midwestern', 'girl-next', 'door', 'complete', 'integrity', 'fell', 'love', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'also', 'genuine', 'acting', 'talent', 'hope', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'Sadly', 'one', 'few', 'girls', 'film', 'who', ""n't"", 'take', 'shirt', 'hate', 'when', '.If', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'AP', 'fan', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'one', 'pranks', 'are', 'recycled', '@', 'least', 'variations', 'predecessors', 'Also', 'special', 'features', 'one', 'are', 'LAME', 'Still', 'just', 'barely', 'watchable', 'party', 'movie', 'genre', 'thing']",N/A

Horrible, in fact.When I first saw this movie on the shelf at the movie store, I couldn't help but laugh. And to those of you who were giving crap to the people that reviewed this movie without even bothering to watch it first, well....can you blame them? I mean honestly. There is a reason why some movies don't make it to the theatre, and go straight to DVD. And this movie would be a great example of why that happens.Now, ill agree with some of you who say that ""American Wedding"" wasn't very good. In fact, it was a pretty big disappointment. I feel that they should have stopped making these movies after ""american pie 2"" but I definitely wouldn't go so far as to say that it was worse than this movie. Because there is no comparison whatsoever. Atleast ""american wedding"" still had a few good laughs, and there was an actual point to that movie, not to mention that it still had most of the original cast in it.Anyway, I happened to come across this movie a few nights ago when they showed it on TBS after Sex and the City. I decided to watch it, just to see if it was as bad as I figured it would be. But I was wrong. Because it was WORSE than I thought. Its not even funny in a stupid way. Its just plain stupid. The guy who plays Stiflers younger brother is a really bad actor. I thought he resembled the actual Stifler....for about two seconds. He tries waaaaay too hard to impersonate him, especially when he tries to annoyingly imitate Stiflers facial expressions. Its painful to see. And come on....his punishment after the prank he played on his high school's band is to be sent to band camp? Right.Seriously. I advise you, do NOT waste your money on this movie.

I laughed over and over, despite the ridiculousness of some scenes and the contrived setup of sending a Stifler to band camp.  About that...Matt Stifler (Tad Hilgenbrink), the original's younger brother, got into too much trouble on the eve of his senior year with a giant prank played against the outgoing senior class, and the guidance counselor (The Sherminator from the originals) sentences him to a summer at band camp.  His female arch nemesis Elyse (Arielle Kebbel) just happens to be the band leader at this camp.The predictable ensues - trouble, strife, understanding, camaraderie, triumph - leading to the final battle between the Stifler/Elyse band and the local rich kid band.  Along the way Matt uses some recently purchased spy gear to record ""Bandies Gone Wild,"" video proof of all the wild rumors of band camp (i.e. ""This one time, at band camp..."").The best part about this movie is the two leads.  First and foremost, Tad Hilgenbrink is PERFECT.  I checked IMDB while watching the movie to see if he was actually related to Sean William Scott.  I'm still convinced he's a second cousin or something.  Arielle Kebbel is absolutely gorgeous and perfect for the over-achieving role.  Despite the fact that none of the originals returned, Eugene Levy stuck around for the paycheck.Unless you've never heard of the American Pie series - if so, welcome to Earth - this should come as no surprise.  It's racy, crude, filled with sex and nudity, and exactly what's expected.Jason Elin",4,Surprisingly hilarious,1293148800,"12 24, 2010",2010,1649,"['liked', 'previous', 'American', 'Pie', 'movies', 'thought', 'Stifler', 'stole', 'scene', 'uttered', 'vulgarity', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'movie', 'laughed', 'over', 'over', 'ridiculousness', 'scenes', 'contrived', 'setup', 'sending', 'Stifler', 'band', 'camp', 'Matt', 'Stifler', 'Tad', 'Hilgenbrink', 'original', 'younger', 'brother', 'got', 'too', 'much', 'trouble', 'eve', 'senior', 'year', 'giant', 'prank', 'played', 'outgoing', 'senior', 'class', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'Sherminator', 'originals', 'summer', 'band', 'camp', 'female', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Elyse', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'just', 'be', 'band', 'leader', 'camp.The', 'predictable', 'ensues', 'trouble', 'strife', 'understanding', 'camaraderie', 'triumph', 'leading', 'final', 'battle', 'Stifler/Elyse', 'band', 'local', 'rich', 'kid', 'band', 'way', 'Matt', 'recently', 'purchased', 'spy', 'gear', 'record', 'Bandies', 'Gone', 'Wild', 'video', 'proof', 'wild', 'rumors', 'band', 'camp', 'i.e', 'one', 'time', 'band', 'camp', '.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'two', 'leads', 'First', 'foremost', 'Tad', 'Hilgenbrink', 'PERFECT', 'checked', 'IMDB', 'watching', 'movie', 'see', 'was', 'actually', 'related', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', ""'m"", 'still', 'convinced', 'second', 'cousin', 'something', 'Arielle', 'Kebbel', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'perfect', 'over-achieving', 'role', 'fact', 'none', 'originals', 'returned', 'Eugene', 'Levy', 'stuck', 'paycheck.Unless', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'American', 'Pie', 'series', 'so', 'welcome', 'Earth', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'racy', 'crude', 'filled', 'sex', 'nudity', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

On IMDB, with 2,770 votes cast, it has a 4.9 out of 10 rating. THAT is the rating I feel is most appropriate.And some people here gave this movie five stars? Are you serious? Are you high? Were you high when watching?I rented this for one reason: to see how bad it was. It came perilously close to a one star rating, but it had a few redeeming qualities, such as Arielle Kebbel as Elyse, and Tad Hilgenbrink's uncanny resemblance to the older Stifler. Amazon says he doesn't have the same impish charm; perhaps they're right. But he showed a softer side than his older brother ever did, and that was what saved this movie from one star. Elyse said something early in the film about Stifler from his younger days - she said that when he was around her, he was Matt, but when he was around his older brother, he was a jerk. Sure, his metamorphosis into a caring person comes too quickly, and sure, Elyse should never have forgiven him for his many, many stupid things (could anyone date a guy who tried to have sex with an oboe and was CAUGHT?) but the metamorphosis does come, and in a rare occurrence for an American Pie movie, someone actually grows up. (The Shermanator does not count. He's a guidance counselor? Give me a break. He could hardly guide himself through a maze.)The movie's premise was profoundly ridiculous. A guidance counselor sends a bratty teenager to Band Camp when he doesn't play an instrument? And Band Camp is a serious event? The good ol' Shermanator proves he's still a little geeky boy with no ability to make real-life decisions.The plot, and most of the events surrounding the plot (Stifler ordered how many thousands of dollars worth of spying equipment...when did he become rich?) are incomprehensible, but I have to admit that I did laugh a few times.Oh, and if you like Tad - that is, if you think he's cute - there are some bonuses in the film for you.

Stifler is still at it in the 4th installment, though it aint the Stifler you think it is. Instead of Steve, we have Matt Stifler, the younger brother who is all grown up now and heading into his summer break of his junior year of high school. The school is having is having a ceremony for the seniors as a last goodbye. The school band is there to play, but Stifler has other ideas. Stifler's little prank goes a little haywire which causes him to get into some trouble. His penalty?... To go to band camp and learn to be a team player. Trying to turn a negative into a positive, Matt decides to buy spy gear and spy on his new found camp goers to catch them doing some dirty acts with one another. Just Stifler being a Stifler.I really liked Band Camp and think it was a decent installment to the series. Sure it's got a lower budget and a no name cast, but it does feel like a Pie movie. Actually, it could've been called Band Camp without the American Pie name and it probably wouldn't get nearly the heat it gets. While American Wedding tried and failed (in my opinion) to make Steve seem kind of likeable in the end, Band Camp does give you hope for Matt. In the beginning, Matt is a total jerk who doesn't want nothing more than to be like his older brother Steve. Through the movie though, you can see him beginning to become less of a jerk and more of an okay friend to hopefully one day an ok guy. It was nice to see him begin to stick up to his friends, while at the same time still being `himself'. He still liked to play the pranks and he still liked to get the girls, but he stopped with worrying about what some people thought about him.As for the jokes and nudity, there is an abundance. I laughed at a lot of the scenes, even the dumb ones. I couldn't help it. Maybe it's cause I didn't take the movie serious when going into it. I actually thought it was going to be really bad, but was definitely surprised. Everything from the oboe scene to the special sunscreen I liked. And there were plenty of boob shots thanks to the spy cams. And for you girls, Matt loves to show off his butt.Also there are even some nice scenes for you love doves out there. It was kind a funny to see one of the nerdy guys who became Matt's first friend at camp trying to get with the bad girl of the group. And there was one scene that I liked that had two people on a dock. It was sweet. Yeah I said it. Do something.In the end I would say it's a worthy addition to the Pie family.

949287,A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B000BT970Y,"Michael Brent Faulkner, Jr. ""Brent Faulkner""","[1, 5]","Having seen all of the AMERICAN PIE movies, a very safe deduction to make is that the original AMERICAN PIE with Jason Biggs, and the rest of the original cast is the best, period.  AMERICAN PIE 2 wasn't as good as AMERICAN PIE, understandable considering that it is a sequel, yet it wasn't a bad movie.  The last two movies of the AP Series have both been serious stretches.  While AMERICAN WEDDING did include Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott, it was a stretch and didn't feel as funny as either AP 1 or 2.  This movie, I wouldn't venture so far as to say that it is necessarily better than American Wedding, but I would say that it is just as good or about the same.  Still, it is a notch or two below the excellence of the original and even the initial sequal, but it serves its purpose as a somewhat funny, silly teen sex movie.What doesn't work here with American Pie is some of the comedy or what is supposed to be positioned as funny.  For example, Eugene Levy's role as Jim's Dad (here as a staffer at the Band Camp) is dry as ever, yet the dryness of the the lines and things that he says don't come over as funny or witty as they did in either of the first 2 AP movies.  That isn't to say that he doesn't have his moments, but they don't shine like they do in the earlier movies showing that the American Pie series is definitely showing its age.Another thing that doesn't particularly shine about AP4 is the fact that it is Unrated. It isn't particularly necessary and it doesn't really add to the film.  By this film, number 4 in the series, everything just begins to fall off.  What this movie truly shows is the fact that there can always be too much of a good thing.  The story line is ultimately silly and unrealistic, yet in some ways it is fun.  What is probably most untrue to the American Pie tradition is the fact that Stiffler's Little Bro changes as opposed to being in the constantly referenced ""Family Business"".  That ending comes over as somewhat sappy and corny, but despite the silly, and sometimes lacking story line, this AP does serve its purpose if not to the level of its better films, aka AMERICAN PIE and stretching the slightest bit AMERICAN PIE 2.  2.5 Stars.",3,2.5 Stars-- Could've Been Better...

This was not the fourth instalment in the American Pie series, but more of a spin-off.  It's unfortunate that a triology like American Pie has this trying to ride on it's coat tails.Here we see the younger brother of American Pie's Steve Stiffler, Matt Stiffler, who is following in his older brother's footsteps.  His bad behavior at school has resulted in a discipline action: go to band camp this summer or be expelled.  Whoa to the innocents at band camp who are there to feel the wrath of Matt's evil nature.  Matt plots to make the best of his band camp experience by filming a Girls Gone Wild type video to sell and make him rich.  Naturally, Stiffler meets a wonderful girl amidst the quirky, somewhat awkward characters who he tries to clean up his act to have her actually like him.  But he gives into his wants by pulling pranks (the ipecac syrip on the band instruments), is discovered, and emerges from band camp having learned his lessons.This started off with an alright premiss, but it quickly fell flat.  The American Pie movies set the bar, but we already knew what was going to happen thanks to the other three movies.  The lead, Matt, was actually a dead ringer for the guy who played Stiffler in the original Pie movies, even though he has darker hair and features.  But, the first Stiffler did it before.  And where are the sex games that Michelle kept talking about that all the band camp geeks do!?!  That's why we rented this movie to begin with!Meh, it's alright, but don't take it too seriously.",2,"This one time, at band camp ...

Yes, a spin-off more than a sequel, but, it still let us know that it had to do witht the others. It told us in references about Jim and Michelle, and, of course, ol' Steve. Also, Eugene Levy as Jim's dad and the Sherminator as the school counselor reprise their roles. Tad Hilgenbrink (if I spelled that right) did annoy me at first. I thought to myself that this guy is going to embarrass himself trying to act like Sean William Scott's character of his older brother. But, ya know what, after like only 10 minutes into the film, Tad as Matt Stiffler grew on me. I really enjoyed him. Also, I enjoyed the other co-stars as well. I think that the characters of Elyse and her goth friend and fellow bandie were/are great additions to the female AP characters. And, I thought the same for Matt and his posse of 3. I remember seeing commercials to AP:BC and telling myself that even though I want to see it, it'll probably be mediocre at the most. So, I rented from Blockbuster. When I got home, my sister and I watched it and we both enjoyed it and laughed quite frequently. As soon as it ended, I took it back to Blockbuster that same very day. No, not becuase it sucked, but, because I wanted to buy it on DVD immediately for myself. I remembered noticing that the weekly Best Buy add showed AP:BC and the AP:Trilogy for just 15.99 a piece. So, I took my Best Buy gift card that I got for Christmas, and I purchased both right away. The raunchier, unrated versions to be exacts. And, boy, am I pleased.

But I love watching any type of comedy movies and this one made me laugh quite alot. Wasnt better than the other American Pie movie but this one is definately worth the watch. I didnt buy this movie, a friend did I just watched it there. But its pretty funny. The main guy, is a straight idiot so it makes it even more funny.

Unless i missed it...But the plot is based on Stiflers younger brother Matt, who is aspiring to be like his older brother by making adult movies. Unfortunatly his antics plunge him into the school councillors office where the councillor is played by an old cast member ""Shermminator"", in which he sends Matt off to band camp as punishment.Making the most of his oppertunity, Matt arrives at Band camp to the dislike of the rest of his band members and sets up a string of hidden cameras to catch all the so called ""action"" that takes place after the lights go out! But distractions happen when he bumps into an old high school flame... and the plot takes the ever obvious path of love, hate and a happy ending with some comical happenings in between! Jim's Dad also makes an apperance as the Band camp macro (regulator).In the end, worth seeing if you have watched the others, but it will never be the same without the original cast!",3,Watchable But Not The Same,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,1086,"['watching', 'past', '3', 'installments', 'American', 'Pie', 'was', 'shame', 'see', 'could', 'not', 'bring', 'out', '4th', 'was', 'worthy', 'cinema', 'screening', 'i', 'missed', 'plot', 'based', 'Stiflers', 'younger', 'brother', 'Matt', 'who', 'aspiring', 'be', 'older', 'brother', 'making', 'adult', 'movies', 'Unfortunatly', 'antics', 'plunge', 'school', 'councillors', 'office', 'where', 'councillor', 'played', 'old', 'cast', 'member', 'Shermminator', 'Matt', 'band', 'camp', 'punishment.Making', 'most', 'oppertunity', 'Matt', 'Band', 'camp', 'dislike', 'rest', 'band', 'members', 'up', 'string', 'hidden', 'cameras', 'catch', 'so', 'called', 'action', 'place', 'lights', 'go', 'out', 'distractions', 'happen', 'when', 'bumps', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'flame', 'plot', 'ever', 'obvious', 'path', 'love', 'hate', 'happy', 'ending', 'comical', 'happenings', 'Jim', 'Dad', 'also', 'apperance', 'Band', 'camp', 'macro', 'regulator', 'end', 'worth', 'seeing', 'have', 'watched', 'others', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'original', 'cast']",N/A
