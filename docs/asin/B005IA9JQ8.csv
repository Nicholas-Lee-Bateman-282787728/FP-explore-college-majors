They are brand new, and come out to $10 a season.  Only other better deals might be on a used one, but then you never know if the DVDs will be scratched, even if they say they are in good condition.  But for an extra buck or two, I would rather have new.My GF has really enjoyed the Friends series.  It is pretty funny.  I will even watch an episode here or there.",5,Purchased as a gift.

It is nice to have it on DVD so there are none.  I remember when the show started in the early 90's, and laughing out loud while I watched it. It is just as funny today. The jokes do not get old.

1461767,A3B6X5KB0W963D,B005IA9JQ8,Troll Reviewer,"[0, 2]","One of the best and longest-running sitcoms of the 90s, ""Friends"" arguably had its peak in quality during seasons two through four. This deal where two seasons are being sold as $19.99 (currently) is great; for anyone wanting to buy the complete series, it actually currently costs less to just get all five of these double-season releases than to get the complete series all at once.Season three's strongest episodes are the ones with a lot of Ross & Rachel drama (""The One Where Ross & Rachel Take a Break,"" The One with the Morning After""), although several other more comedic episodes (""The One with the Football,"" ""The One with the Race Car Bed"") are almost just as good. The show is very entertaining, with excellent acting by the ensemble cast.Best season three episodes: ""The One Where Ross & Rachel Take a Break"" and ""The One with the Morning After""Season grade: B+_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Season four is about the same level of quality as the already-satisfying season three, with THE best episode of the entire series (""The One with the Embryos""), as well as the famous episode with Ross's wedding flub (""The One with Ross's Wedding""). It's probably the best season of the show yet. However, I don't understand why they had to do an episode that was mainly a clip show (""The One with the Invitation"")...were the show's ratings actually that low? Or maybe they just wanted to remind viewers of how much chemistry Ross & Rachel had.Best season four episodes: ""The One with the Embryos"" and ""The One with Ross's Wedding""Season grade: B+",4,Two of the best seasons in a bargain-priced set,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,1644,"['One', 'best', 'longest-running', 'sitcoms', '90s', 'Friends', 'arguably', 'had', 'peak', 'quality', 'seasons', 'two', 'four', 'deal', 'where', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'being', 'sold', '19.99', 'currently', 'great', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'buy', 'complete', 'series', 'actually', 'currently', 'less', 'just', 'get', 'five', 'double-season', 'releases', 'get', 'complete', 'series', 'once.Season', 'three', 'strongest', 'episodes', 'are', 'ones', 'lot', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'drama', 'One', 'Where', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'Take', 'Break', 'One', 'Morning', 'several', 'other', 'more', 'comedic', 'episodes', 'One', 'Football', 'One', 'Race', 'Car', 'Bed', 'are', 'almost', 'just', 'good', 'show', 'very', 'entertaining', 'excellent', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'cast.Best', 'season', 'three', 'episodes', 'One', 'Where', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'Take', 'Break', 'One', 'Morning', 'Season', 'grade', 'B+_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Season', 'four', 'same', 'level', 'quality', 'already-satisfying', 'season', 'three', 'THE', 'best', 'episode', 'entire', 'series', 'One', 'Embryos', 'as', 'well', 'famous', 'episode', 'Ross', 'wedding', 'flub', 'One', 'Ross', 'Wedding', 'probably', 'best', 'season', 'show', 'yet', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'had', 'do', 'episode', 'was', 'mainly', 'clip', 'show', 'One', 'Invitation', 'were', 'show', 'ratings', 'actually', 'low', 'maybe', 'just', 'wanted', 'remind', 'viewers', 'how', 'much', 'chemistry', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'had.Best', 'season', 'four', 'episodes', 'One', 'Embryos', 'One', 'Ross', 'Wedding', 'Season', 'grade', 'B+']",Friends: The Complete Third and Fourth Seasons
