803607,A6HZN83OUPYRN,B0001FVDG4,976-ERIC,"[2, 2]","On April 14th, much to my surprise, I found in my local FYE store a shrink-wrapped copy of the DVD in subject. Needless to say I bought it and cancelled my Amazon pre-order when I got home.Here is a break-down:The Cover: The image that was touted months ago as promotional ""working art"" is indeed the final cover. That's good news for those who like it and bad for those who don't (I think it is lame personally; why not some art based on the episodes therein?). You do, however, get a glossy cardboard slip with ""bumpy"" TMNTs and letters to run you fingers over (wahoo!).The menus: As Michelangelo would say ""lame-ola""! The main menu uses the front cover art and the episode selection uses the back cover art (the only way it could have been any more generic would have been to had the Artisan and FHE logos in the background). No snappy animated sequences to take you to the selection you clicked and worse still, no menu music! That's right no TMNT credit theme, nothing but the hum of your DVD player and television set.The episodes:Picture and sound:No attempt to clean up the picture has been made whatsoever. Picture artifacts abound in the '87 epsidoes. The picture is also a little ""grainy"" (though I don't think it is bad; It is identical to the FHE laserdisc releases, for any who own them.) The sound was not improved either. While it is clear, it is quite low, similar to 60s cartoons on DVD. The newer episodes on the disc are better of course.Bonus material:The ""unaired"" episodes (already de-mythed by now) are the ONLY bonus material on here at all unfortunately. Perhaps there are some easter eggs, but I couldn't find any.As for the actual 'toons. I won't waste any bandwidth on them. If you are reading this you've seen them, and if you love them like I do you'll buy this any way. I will mention that they are indeed in their entirety (not the 72 minute edit that was originally slated for release) and including for the 1st time the opening theme, episode title screen and closing credits for all episodes (I should mention that annoyingly enough each episode is on one track only; like on a VCD).Final analysis:  This sure beats having the former FHE releases of the mini-series on 3 SLP tapes (and taped from TV versions of the ""unaired"" eps). If you have the laserdisc releases of the mini-series and don't like the ""unaired"" episodes (I know some didn't like the ""red sky"" days. I personally thought they were great) you may want to pass, as the quality is exactly the same.- poor menus, one track per episode, lame artwork, no extras, ""unaired episodes"" advertisement misleading, no remaster job.+ great mini-series finally in one place with titles and all. 9 episodes on one disc.Cartoon - 10DVD - 7",4,Classic Cartoon gets a fair DVD release,1082160000,"04 17, 2004",2004,2727,"['April', '14th', 'much', 'surprise', 'found', 'local', 'FYE', 'store', 'shrink-wrapped', 'copy', 'DVD', 'subject', 'Needless', 'say', 'bought', 'cancelled', 'Amazon', 'pre-order', 'when', 'got', 'home.Here', 'break-down', 'Cover', 'image', 'was', 'touted', 'months', 'ago', 'promotional', 'working', 'art', 'indeed', 'final', 'cover', 'good', 'news', 'who', 'bad', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'lame', 'personally', 'why', 'not', 'art', 'based', 'episodes', 'therein', 'do', 'however', 'get', 'glossy', 'cardboard', 'slip', 'bumpy', 'TMNTs', 'letters', 'run', 'fingers', 'wahoo', '.The', 'menus', 'Michelangelo', 'would', 'say', 'lame-ola', 'main', 'menu', 'front', 'cover', 'art', 'episode', 'selection', 'back', 'cover', 'art', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'generic', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'Artisan', 'FHE', 'logos', 'background', 'snappy', 'animated', 'sequences', 'take', 'selection', 'clicked', 'worse', 'still', 'menu', 'music', 'right', 'TMNT', 'credit', 'theme', 'nothing', 'hum', 'DVD', 'player', 'television', 'set.The', 'episodes', 'Picture', 'sound', 'attempt', 'clean', 'up', 'picture', 'been', 'made', 'whatsoever', 'Picture', 'abound', ""'87"", 'epsidoes', 'picture', 'also', 'little', 'grainy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'bad', 'identical', 'FHE', 'laserdisc', 'releases', 'who', 'own', 'sound', 'was', 'not', 'improved', 'either', 'clear', 'quite', 'low', 'similar', '60s', 'cartoons', 'DVD', 'newer', 'episodes', 'disc', 'are', 'better', 'course.Bonus', 'material', 'unaired', 'episodes', 'already', 'de-mythed', 'now', 'are', 'ONLY', 'material', 'here', 'unfortunately', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'easter', 'eggs', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'any.As', 'actual', ""'toons"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'waste', 'bandwidth', 'are', 'reading', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'love', 'do', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'way', 'will', 'mention', 'are', 'indeed', 'entirety', 'not', '72', 'minute', 'edit', 'was', 'originally', 'slated', 'release', 'including', '1st', 'time', 'opening', 'theme', 'episode', 'title', 'screen', 'closing', 'credits', 'episodes', 'should', 'mention', 'annoyingly', 'enough', 'episode', 'one', 'track', 'only', 'VCD', '.Final', 'analysis', 'sure', 'having', 'former', 'FHE', 'releases', 'mini-series', '3', 'SLP', 'tapes', 'taped', 'TV', 'versions', 'unaired', 'eps', 'have', 'laserdisc', 'releases', 'mini-series', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'unaired', 'episodes', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'red', 'sky', 'days', 'personally', 'thought', 'were', 'great', 'may', 'want', 'pass', 'quality', 'exactly', 'same.-', 'poor', 'menus', 'one', 'track', 'episode', 'lame', 'artwork', 'extras', 'unaired', 'episodes', 'advertisement', 'misleading', 'remaster', 'great', 'mini-series', 'finally', 'one', 'place', 'titles', '9', 'episodes', 'one', 'disc.Cartoon', '10DVD', '7']",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Season 1 Ver 2

803612,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B0001FVDG4,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[1, 1]","The helmet is symbolic for the first outing of the pizza-chowing Ninja Turtles. The reptilian, ninja-fighting foursome Leonardo, Raphael, Michaelangelo and Donatello and their battles against the evil Shredder are one of the poster-childs of 80s and 90s culture. No other animated show can to this day boast of sporting a quartet of ninja turtles, a rat ninja master, a warthog with a mohawk and an awol militant-clad, trigger-happy rhino. It's not hard to see how all this captivated a boy's imagination. And this is where it all started; the five-episode pilot season of 1987. Sure, it is short, and maybe the DVD's quality is not as crystal clear as we have got used to. Sure, there are no special features to speak of. But that doesn't change the fact that this is the definite DVD to get if you want to see the pizza-chowing foursome at their finest.April O'Neill, a hot-shot TV reporter, is covering a story about a series of raids of scientific equipment companies when she is assaulted by a gang of thugs, sent to stop her by an unknown person. She is saved by four humanoid turtles. They and their mentor, Splinter, were mutated by a special mutogen; the turtles into humanoid turtles - Splinter, who was once a man, into a rat. Eventually, the Turtles learn of the existence of a ""Technodrome""; an underground, mobile fortress from which ninja master the Shredder and an extra-dimensional brain named Krang are hatching a scheme to take over Earth, with the dubious assistance of mutated punks Bebop and Rocksteady (who sports a helmet in this season that he never does again, for some reason).TMNT is famous for being a fun, action-filled series and this 5-episode pilot season delivers, and then some. Not only is it a blast to watch, full of great characters - it's also an intricate ninja crime story. All episodes hang together like an intricate chain, even though all have a separate story to build on. All help to bring the story, slowly, forward, bringing a great level of consistency to the show's first moments. All courtesy of writers Patty Howeth and David Wise (the latter of whom wrote several stand-out episodes later in the series but even then never managed to top himself).Does that mean that it's a completely infallible piece of entertainment? Of course not. Especially the first episode has more cheekiness and conundrums in it than you can shake a katana at. The reason it works is because it's a very tightly packed together story, and because there's such an air of fun over everything. The animation may not be perfect but boy did they try. This season was art-directed by Peter Chung, of later on Flux fame, and the animation, though technically not perfect, is alive and of high standard for tv at the time.This is also probably the one Ninja Turtles season that takes itself seriously, at least in some way; Rocksteady and Bebop are dangerous, violent foes in this season. Sure, there's a lot of humour that's predominant but I just wish that the entire series could've been like this season. It's slick, it's funny, it's entertaining, it's well-woven. It's great. I could not have hoped for a better reacquaintance with the world of the Ninja Turtles than this season. As I watch, old fantasies of being a rhino man are reawakened. This first season is where the Ninja Turtles are at their finest.",5,Rocksteady Has His Helmet!,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,3336,"['helmet', 'symbolic', 'first', 'outing', 'pizza-chowing', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'reptilian', 'ninja-fighting', 'foursome', 'Leonardo', 'Raphael', 'Michaelangelo', 'Donatello', 'battles', 'evil', 'Shredder', 'are', 'one', 'poster-childs', '80s', '90s', 'culture', 'other', 'animated', 'show', 'can', 'day', 'boast', 'sporting', 'quartet', 'ninja', 'turtles', 'rat', 'ninja', 'master', 'warthog', 'mohawk', 'awol', 'militant-clad', 'trigger-happy', 'rhino', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'how', 'captivated', 'boy', 'imagination', 'where', 'started', 'five-episode', 'pilot', 'season', '1987', 'Sure', 'short', 'maybe', 'DVD', 'quality', 'not', 'crystal', 'clear', 'have', 'got', 'used', 'Sure', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'speak', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'definite', 'DVD', 'get', 'want', 'see', 'pizza-chowing', 'foursome', 'finest.April', ""O'Neill"", 'hot-shot', 'TV', 'reporter', 'covering', 'story', 'series', 'raids', 'scientific', 'equipment', 'companies', 'when', 'assaulted', 'gang', 'thugs', 'sent', 'stop', 'unknown', 'person', 'saved', 'four', 'humanoid', 'turtles', 'mentor', 'Splinter', 'were', 'mutated', 'special', 'mutogen', 'turtles', 'humanoid', 'turtles', 'Splinter', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'man', 'rat', 'Eventually', 'Turtles', 'learn', 'existence', 'Technodrome', 'underground', 'mobile', 'fortress', 'ninja', 'master', 'Shredder', 'extra-dimensional', 'brain', 'named', 'Krang', 'are', 'hatching', 'scheme', 'take', 'over', 'Earth', 'dubious', 'assistance', 'mutated', 'punks', 'Bebop', 'Rocksteady', 'who', 'sports', 'helmet', 'season', 'never', 'again', 'reason', '.TMNT', 'famous', 'being', 'fun', 'action-filled', 'series', '5-episode', 'pilot', 'season', 'delivers', 'then', 'Not', 'only', 'blast', 'watch', 'full', 'great', 'characters', 'also', 'intricate', 'ninja', 'crime', 'story', 'episodes', 'hang', 'together', 'intricate', 'chain', 'even', 'have', 'separate', 'story', 'build', 'help', 'bring', 'story', 'slowly', 'forward', 'bringing', 'great', 'level', 'consistency', 'show', 'first', 'moments', 'courtesy', 'writers', 'Patty', 'Howeth', 'David', 'Wise', 'latter', 'whom', 'wrote', 'several', 'stand-out', 'episodes', 'later', 'series', 'even', 'then', 'never', 'managed', 'top', 'mean', 'completely', 'infallible', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'course', 'not', 'Especially', 'first', 'episode', 'more', 'cheekiness', 'conundrums', 'can', 'shake', 'katana', 'reason', 'very', 'tightly', 'packed', 'together', 'story', 'such', 'air', 'fun', 'everything', 'animation', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'boy', 'did', 'try', 'season', 'was', 'art-directed', 'Peter', 'Chung', 'later', 'Flux', 'fame', 'animation', 'though', 'technically', 'not', 'perfect', 'alive', 'high', 'standard', 'tv', 'time.This', 'also', 'probably', 'one', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'season', 'seriously', 'least', 'way', 'Rocksteady', 'Bebop', 'are', 'dangerous', 'violent', 'foes', 'season', 'Sure', 'lot', 'humour', 'predominant', 'just', 'wish', 'entire', 'series', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'season', 'slick', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'well-woven', 'great', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'hoped', 'better', 'reacquaintance', 'world', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'season', 'watch', 'old', 'fantasies', 'being', 'rhino', 'man', 'are', 'reawakened', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'are', 'finest']",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Season 1 Ver 2

Four regular turtles transformed by a genetic mutegen into anthropomorphic fighting ninjas known as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Leonard lead, Donatello was the brains, Ralphael with an in your face attitude and Michaelangelo was a party animal.Now thanks to DVD all fans both old and new have a chance to get reaquanted with our four favorite turtle warriors. The first five episodes of this long running series as well as the five last episode of the series are available all on one disk.It's a great start but also a bit disapointing that it's being done this way. This will more wet your appetite then soothe your hunger overall. It will give you a taste of what the show has to offer but leave you hanging a bit. I am a bit surprised that the whole first season wasn't released in a set rather then doing it with just the first five episodes as well as some bonus episodes at the end of the series which had a totaly differnet take on the series by the time it was ending. so that too may confuse people rather then satisfy.In the first five episodes we learn about the originals of the Turtles and their master Splinter who is a former Ninja teacher from Japan who was mutated with a rat at the same time the Turtles themselves were mutated into human form. They meet their human friend, a reporter named April O'Neil who becomes a trusting and loyal ally who seems to get mixed up in all the trouble that the turtles do. Their fight is against Shredder, an evil leader of a gang known as the foot clan who wants to take over the city and more. Shredder is being helped by an alien brain from Dimention X known as Krang.This series is a bit dated. A lot of the animation is old style and the sayings and situations can be corny as well. Even back when I watched it I found it a little on the campy side, but I think in a way that was part of the thrill of this cartoon. It's fun, action packed, humorous at times and kicks major shell. I am only disapointed that we only get a few episodes to start us off rather then a whole season. But I am sure we will see many more episodes to come in the future and good things are more then worth waiting for.COWABUNGA!!

Thankfully, that one second is nothing except part of the technodrome blasting through rocks. No big deal unless you're an obsessed collector. Fans might also be dissapointed that that special features are nill. I personally would like to have seen profiles of the characters. The last flaw is that the bonus episodes are shown in the wrong order. That's all.Those who did not watch the series to its end may notice in the bonus episodes that Michaelangello now uses a grappling hook instead of nunchukues.

803632,A3BQCZNB97XUNY,B0001FVDG4,"Eggplant ""Eyehateamazon""","[3, 3]","Well, here it is, turtle fans: the wait is finally over. After months and months of waiting, the original '80s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that I, and 90% of kids my age (even some girls) grew up with, have finally been released on DVD! So the big question is: is it worth it?Yep.First of all, the packaging. As stated previously, it comes in a shiny, metallic box, with the artwork you see above you. Inside, is the actual case, with the same artwork, but without the metallic luster. Nothing outstanding, but pretty neat.The picture and sound quality are very good, considering the age of the episodes (they aired December 1987). Yes, the animation pales in comparison to the animation of today, but keep in mind... DECEMBER 1987. But overall it looks and sounds really good.Okay, now for the most important thing of all: the content. When you first pop the DVD in, as stated before, there is no background music at the main menu; just the hum of your DVD player. This is no big deal, but it would've been pretty cool to hear the closing theme (the one they play over the credits).The main episodes that this set contains is the original 5-part miniseries that started the whole series. They are five seperate, 22-minute episodes (complete with opening theme song and closing credits), but are all linked together. It tells the origin of Donatello, Leonardo, Raphael (my favorite turtle), Michaelangelo, Splinter, April O'Neal, Shredder, Baxter Stockman, etc. These early episodes combine the familiar one-liners and funny character building scenes with great martial arts action; a great mix.Now for the bonus episodes: these are from the last season (1996). By then I was 10 years old and not really into TMNT anymore. These are the infamous ""red sky"" episodes that you hear so much about. They certainly aren't as horrible as some people make them out to be, but they're not that great either, IMHO. They changed the original theme song that everybody and their mother's familiar with, replacing it with some goofy, lackluster techno version. Also, they sort of redid the animation; the Turtles now had weird-looking eyes. Also, they gave April bright blue eyes (VERY nice) but took away her infamous, attractive yellow jumpsuit (bogus). They also added some new character; a  kid named Carter. And of course, instead of Shredder, they now fought some alien named Dregg. (ehhh...) These episodes aren't really bad or good. Needless to say, the originals are much better.So if you're a fan of the original TMNT like me, or even if you just want to dive into the history of animation (or learn about 80's cartoons), buy this set. The price is right, and this will encourage them to keep releasing the other seasons.COWABUNGA!",5,Heroes In A Half Shell - TURTLE POWER!,1083542400,"05 3, 2004",2004,2729,"['Well', 'here', 'turtle', 'fans', 'wait', 'finally', 'months', 'months', 'waiting', 'original', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', '90', '%', 'kids', 'age', 'even', 'girls', 'grew', 'up', 'have', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'big', 'question', 'Yep.First', 'packaging', 'stated', 'previously', 'shiny', 'metallic', 'box', 'artwork', 'see', 'Inside', 'actual', 'case', 'same', 'artwork', 'metallic', 'luster', 'Nothing', 'outstanding', 'pretty', 'neat.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'considering', 'age', 'episodes', 'aired', 'December', '1987', 'Yes', 'animation', 'pales', 'comparison', 'animation', 'today', 'keep', 'mind', 'DECEMBER', '1987', 'overall', 'really', 'good.Okay', 'now', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'content', 'When', 'first', 'pop', 'DVD', 'stated', 'background', 'music', 'main', 'menu', 'just', 'hum', 'DVD', 'player', 'big', 'deal', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'pretty', 'cool', 'hear', 'closing', 'theme', 'one', 'play', 'credits', '.The', 'main', 'episodes', 'set', 'original', '5-part', 'miniseries', 'started', 'whole', 'series', 'are', 'five', 'seperate', '22-minute', 'episodes', 'complete', 'opening', 'theme', 'song', 'closing', 'credits', 'are', 'linked', 'together', 'origin', 'Donatello', 'Leonardo', 'Raphael', 'favorite', 'turtle', 'Michaelangelo', 'Splinter', 'April', ""O'Neal"", 'Shredder', 'Baxter', 'Stockman', 'etc', 'early', 'episodes', 'combine', 'familiar', 'one-liners', 'funny', 'character', 'building', 'scenes', 'great', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'great', 'mix.Now', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'are', 'last', 'season', '1996', 'then', 'was', '10', 'years', 'old', 'not', 'really', 'TMNT', 'anymore', 'are', 'infamous', 'red', 'sky', 'hear', 'so', 'much', 'certainly', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'horrible', 'people', 'make', 'out', 'be', ""'re"", 'not', 'great', 'IMHO', 'changed', 'original', 'theme', 'song', 'everybody', 'mother', 'familiar', 'replacing', 'goofy', 'lackluster', 'techno', 'version', 'Also', 'sort', 'redid', 'animation', 'Turtles', 'now', 'had', 'weird-looking', 'eyes', 'Also', 'gave', 'April', 'bright', 'blue', 'eyes', 'VERY', 'nice', 'took', 'away', 'infamous', 'attractive', 'yellow', 'jumpsuit', 'bogus', 'also', 'added', 'new', 'character', 'kid', 'named', 'Carter', 'course', 'instead', 'Shredder', 'now', 'fought', 'alien', 'named', 'Dregg', 'ehhh', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'bad', 'good', 'Needless', 'say', 'originals', 'are', 'much', ""'re"", 'fan', 'original', 'TMNT', 'even', 'just', 'want', 'dive', 'history', 'animation', 'learn', '80', 'cartoons', 'buy', 'set', 'price', 'right', 'will', 'encourage', 'keep', 'releasing', 'other', 'seasons.COWABUNGA']",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Season 1 Ver 2
803633,A2SKAHJXH7XDU5,B0001FVDG4,E,"[2, 3]","I was about 5 or 6 years old when the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles used to come on television on Saturday mornings in the late 80s/early 90s. I used to love waking up extra early on Saturday mornings before mom and dad got up and would plop onto the couch in the den and zone out with all the Saturday morning cartoons, but the Ninja Turtles were by far my favorites! My favorite was Leonardo (the blue one with the katanas) and still is! Perhaps it's just the opinion of an 80s baby but I look at what TV stations have as the cartoon lineup for Saturday mornings now and it's just not the same. (I'd even say some of newer cartoons are...weird and boggles my mind as to how they'd be enjoyable to a child.)This is a splendid DVD collection collecting the original first five episodes (while there are four other ""lost"" episodes) which are the ones I really care about, especially because I used to have the equivalent episodes on VHS (still do actually) and them being on DVD is even better. I really like the episode ""Hot Roddin' Teenagers"" with Krang and the teens from Dimension X. Or how about the episode with Baxter Stockman (aka the Fly) and the mousers? People: THIS IS GOOD STUFF! (Especially if you LOVE cartoons!)They tried to revamp the Ninja Turtles in the mid-late 90s into a grittier, darker team which is a pretty series but doesn't even come close to the original series. I agree with one of the reviewers before me who said the artwork in the original series looks like an Americanized version of anime: I couldn't have put it any better. They have a very ""cartoony"" look and feel and that's just the way I liked 'em and grew up with them. Who doesn't like James Avery as the Shredder??!

The Story deals with four human-like anthropomorphic mutated turtles who were once ordinary turtles turned to what they are thanks to chemicals especially their once human master named Splinter who are trained in the art of ninjetsu as they befriend a beautiful news reporter named April O'Neil to fight crime and battle the forces of the evil Shredder especially munch down pizza.This DVD has the first five episodes which were actually part of a mini-series that lead to the successful show. The first part ""Turtle Tracks"" introduces our heroes Leonardo, Donetello, Ralphel and party-loving Michaelangelo especially April, Splinter and The Shredder plus their origins next there's ""Enter The Shredder"" where the turtles track down the Shredder plus the dreaded brain-like creature named Krang from Dimension X and two dim-witted mutants Bebop and Rocksteady. ""A Thing About Rats"" has a shy scientist named Baxter Stockman who just made pefect robotic mouse-traps becomes a pawn in Shredder's game to kill Splinter, ""Hot-Rodding Teenagers from Dimension X"" is exactally what the episode's title says as punks from another dimension just wanting to have fun here on Earth get in trouble with the warlords and the Ninja Turtles to protect them and finally ""Shredded and Splintered"" has Krang with a new body as it rampages through the city and only the turtles can stop it.The picture is decent and so is the sound and the only extra is 4 never-before-seen episodes shown in the U.S. as an extra.

803658,A2U4H0649HI9CE,B0001FVDG4,nir085,"[0, 0]","As thrilled as I am to know that the golden egg of childhood television has been brought to my home, especially since it's in DVD format this time, I still have my share of complaints against the DVD itself. I don't know if some of these drawbacks were because of monetary problems or something else, because they seem like problems Artisan could have easily circumvented, but whatever the reason, it should be changed for the next TMNT DVD. And it really, really would be in Artisan's best interest to make another one of these DVDs. Fans who watched this show a little bit more than a decade ago and fans of the new series will always continue to purchase these DVDs as long as they continue to be released.THE GOOD:-I like the slip on cover. You don't see too many of those these days outside of Disney DVDs. But they did make it a little too tight...-Some may complain about the simple, silly looking artwork, but it fits the DVD just fine. The silly, simple happiness of the cover captures the essence of the first season, if not the whole series. However, future season DVDs should have a different, maybe more exciting cover, like with Casey Jones/Krang/Shredder/etc. (this cover suits this DVD perfectly, though).-The price. Another reason why I would buy ten of these DVDs (if there were ten) instead of two of the new TMNT DVDs.-The original TMNT were brought to DVD!!! This mere fact makes this DVD better than most out there. PLEASE RELEASE MORE OF THESE ARTISAN!THE BAD:-The bonus episodes. Initially I was excited to finally see the tenth season episodes that I knew were not available on VHS (nor were shown on television), but it was way too early for these episodes to be released. First of all, none of the fans have any idea where this Dregg guy has come from, whether he is an alien or a Dimension X fiend, and what his connection to the Shredder/Krang is. I did like Lord Dregg, however. Introducing a down-to-evil-business baddie is a nice contrast to the silly Dimension X freaks (not that I don't love them or anything). They were out of order too...I watched the first bonus episode, then the second bonus episode, then I had to go back and watch the first bonus episode again just to understand what was going on. If they are going to release a small part of a saga few fans are familiar with, they can at least put episodes that follow each other one after the other and putting them in order wouldn't hurt either.-Bad choice of bonus episodes. To elaborate on what I started saying above, there are plenty of better bonus episode choices they could have made. Such examples would include character fan-favorite (episodes) like ""Slash"" and ""Usagi Yojimbo"" (fans of the Usagi Yojimbo comics would love this, too). Those episodes are also not available on VHS. Whatever they do...they better not include the concluding episodes in the next DVD...because many fans would not feel like buying any DVDs they would release after that, since they know the ending.-Why no special features? Is it because there were bonus episodes? If so, then I take this comment back: special features are NOT a better alternative to bonus episodes, at least not for the first couple of season DVDs. Still, an interview, some old commercials, movie/toy/cartoon advertisements, new TMNT previews would be greatly appreciated.-Lack of subtitles. Yes, I can speak english just fine, and understand it too, but I still could have swore I heard ""noobs"" and ""boob tube"" being said in the first couple of episodes. Subtitles should not be a high priority should Artisan release another season, but they will definitely not hurt.-Chapter breaks. Not only could you not press rewind from the beginning of one episode to see the end of the previous episode, but chapter breaks in general did not exist.-Boring DVD menu. I didn't expect for them to put an episode as an intro, even so, they could have put the instrumental [original] theme song in the background if nothing else. Or, just, anything really. Too simple.Maybe some of these flaws are because of the wonderful cheap price, maybe not, but if so, then Artisan should consider increasing the price $5-10 to make the DVD a little bit more exciting. I know I would put down that extra bit of money if the DVD was bettered somehow.I am giving 5 stars to this release because it's the original TMNT and 3 stars to the DVD quality, so the average would make that 4.",4,Now I remember why I miss childhood,1089936000,"07 16, 2004",2004,4412,"['As', 'thrilled', 'am', 'know', 'golden', 'egg', 'childhood', 'television', 'been', 'brought', 'home', 'especially', 'DVD', 'format', 'time', 'still', 'have', 'share', 'complaints', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'drawbacks', 'were', 'monetary', 'problems', 'something', 'else', 'seem', 'problems', 'Artisan', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'circumvented', 'reason', 'should', 'be', 'changed', 'next', 'TMNT', 'DVD', 'really', 'really', 'would', 'be', 'Artisan', 'best', 'interest', 'make', 'one', 'DVDs', 'Fans', 'who', 'watched', 'show', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'decade', 'ago', 'fans', 'new', 'series', 'will', 'always', 'continue', 'purchase', 'DVDs', 'as', 'long', 'continue', 'be', 'released.THE', 'GOOD', '-I', 'slip', 'cover', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'too', 'many', 'days', 'Disney', 'DVDs', 'did', 'make', 'little', 'too', 'tight', '-Some', 'may', 'complain', 'simple', 'silly', 'looking', 'artwork', 'DVD', 'just', 'fine', 'silly', 'simple', 'happiness', 'cover', 'essence', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'whole', 'series', 'However', 'future', 'season', 'DVDs', 'should', 'have', 'different', 'maybe', 'more', 'exciting', 'cover', 'Casey', 'Jones/Krang/Shredder/etc', 'cover', 'suits', 'DVD', 'perfectly', '.-The', 'price', 'reason', 'why', 'would', 'buy', 'ten', 'DVDs', 'were', 'ten', 'instead', 'two', 'new', 'TMNT', 'DVDs.-The', 'original', 'TMNT', 'were', 'brought', 'DVD', 'mere', 'fact', 'DVD', 'better', 'most', 'there', 'PLEASE', 'RELEASE', 'MORE', 'THESE', 'ARTISAN', 'THE', 'BAD', '-The', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'Initially', 'was', 'excited', 'finally', 'see', 'tenth', 'season', 'knew', 'were', 'not', 'available', 'VHS', 'were', 'shown', 'television', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'early', 'episodes', 'be', 'released', 'First', 'none', 'fans', 'have', 'idea', 'where', 'Dregg', 'guy', 'come', 'alien', 'Dimension', 'X', 'fiend', 'what', 'connection', 'Shredder/Krang', 'did', 'Lord', 'Dregg', 'however', 'Introducing', 'down-to-evil-business', 'baddie', 'nice', 'contrast', 'silly', 'Dimension', 'X', 'freaks', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'anything', 'were', 'out', 'order', 'too', 'watched', 'first', 'bonus', 'episode', 'then', 'second', 'bonus', 'episode', 'then', 'had', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'first', 'bonus', 'episode', 'again', 'just', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'are', 'going', 'release', 'small', 'part', 'saga', 'few', 'fans', 'are', 'familiar', 'can', 'least', 'put', 'episodes', 'follow', 'other', 'one', 'other', 'putting', 'order', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either.-Bad', 'choice', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'elaborate', 'what', 'started', 'saying', 'are', 'plenty', 'better', 'bonus', 'episode', 'choices', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'Such', 'examples', 'would', 'include', 'character', 'fan-favorite', 'episodes', 'Slash', 'Usagi', 'Yojimbo', 'fans', 'Usagi', 'Yojimbo', 'comics', 'would', 'love', 'too', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'not', 'available', 'VHS', 'do', 'better', 'not', 'include', 'concluding', 'episodes', 'next', 'DVD', 'because', 'many', 'fans', 'would', 'not', 'feel', 'buying', 'DVDs', 'would', 'release', 'know', 'ending.-Why', 'special', 'features', 'were', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'so', 'then', 'take', 'comment', 'back', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'NOT', 'better', 'alternative', 'bonus', 'episodes', 'least', 'not', 'first', 'couple', 'season', 'DVDs', 'Still', 'interview', 'old', 'commercials', 'movie/toy/cartoon', 'advertisements', 'new', 'TMNT', 'previews', 'would', 'be', 'greatly', 'appreciated.-Lack', 'subtitles', 'Yes', 'can', 'speak', 'english', 'just', 'fine', 'understand', 'too', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'swore', 'heard', 'noobs', 'boob', 'tube', 'being', 'said', 'first', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Subtitles', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'high', 'priority', 'should', 'Artisan', 'release', 'season', 'will', 'definitely', 'not', 'hurt.-Chapter', 'breaks', 'Not', 'only', 'could', 'not', 'press', 'rewind', 'beginning', 'one', 'episode', 'see', 'end', 'previous', 'episode', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'general', 'did', 'not', 'exist.-Boring', 'DVD', 'menu', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'put', 'episode', 'intro', 'even', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'instrumental', '[', 'original', ']', 'theme', 'song', 'background', 'nothing', 'else', 'just', 'anything', 'really', 'Too', 'simple.Maybe', 'flaws', 'are', 'wonderful', 'cheap', 'price', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'then', 'Artisan', 'should', 'consider', 'increasing', 'price', '5-10', 'make', 'DVD', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'exciting', 'know', 'would', 'put', 'down', 'extra', 'bit', 'money', 'DVD', 'was', 'bettered', 'somehow.I', 'am', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'release', 'original', 'TMNT', '3', 'stars', 'DVD', 'quality', 'average', 'would', 'make', '4']",Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Season 1 Ver 2

Some of us still love it, while others have come to enjoy the new show more.  I'm somewhere between the 2 camps.  I was born in 1989, but I didn't actually see any episodes on TV except for the ones with Lord Dregg, which I still love (!).  Then after that I rented & bought any of the VHS tapes I could get my hands on.  But how does this show hold up?  I admit the new show is technically better produced & written & a lot more consistently entertaining then the old show, but when the old one is good it's wonderful.  And it's never been better than the 5-part pilot.  The first thing you'll notice is the animation.  Compared to how the show would look for the next 6 years & even after that it's quite good.  It's done by the Japanese animation studio Toei, who did anime like Sailor Moon & the Dragonball cartoons, as well as animated other American 80s classics like G.I. Joe & Transformers.  The writing is also a lot better.  While the later ones tended to be too goofy, this gets the balance between comedy & action just right.  And boy, is the action exciting, even by today's standards.  When people complain about how the show isn't as action-packed as the intro, they forget that this was what it accompanied at first.  Even the voices are a bit better, especially Cam Clark as both Leonardo & Rocksteady.  I'm sorry, but this is pure gold, even without the nostalgia.  And no matter what, this is canon with Archie Comics' TMNT Adventures series, and I'm certainly not going to argue with that.So, how do I feel about the rest of the show?  I'll be honest with you, while seasons 2-6 are incredibly hit or miss (with a LOT of misses, but with some really good hits too) & the first half of season 7 is horrible, I think the latter half of season 7 & all the red sky episodes (seasons 8-10) are great; almost as good as the pilot & fun to watch even compared to the new show.

An Jersey Red isnt even on season 1 either, its like the writers didnt continued where they left off an acted like that thing never happened.Anyway thing about rats too, baxter had short hair but on return of the shredder(1st half of season 2), he had long hair, then short again when he turned into a mutant fly. Again the alien computer comes on bye bye fly episode an son of the return of the fly, and revenage of the fly too.

One of the first things is that this represents the first season with the 5 episodes that made up the season but there aren't any bonus features such as how the thought of a comic characters going from paper to television.  Not only that 4 episodes that are not part of the season on this disc, and I wonder what was the reason for that decision, that really don't make any sense on that.While at the time this show came out I didn't know that the show was derived from a comic until years later, though that this season does try to tell a story like the comic but doesn't tell the story like that in the comics has done.  It's still a popular show by the time that these episodes aired at the time that it did and kids everywhere enjoyed the show.  I have to mention that the animation team that was responsible for this did an alright job, though the animation at times could have been better at least to me it could've.

""Serious"" has nothing to do with this cartoon. The plot is radically differant from anything else you've seen. Splinter, instead of being the pet of Hamato Yoshi actually *is* Hamato Yoshi. Where as every other incarnation of T.M.N.T. is dark and gritty, this show refuses to take itself seriously.While that may be seen as a bad thing to most fans of today, it should be remembered that without the late 80's cartoon show, many people today might never have heard of the Turtles. This cartoon is what brought the Turtles into the spotlight. As corny as it may be for today's standards of dark and gritty story telling, this series is no less a classic. For those with a sense of nostalgia for the shows we used to watch as kids, this DVD is a great buy.Over all grade: Great to have the original series on DVD, minus a star for less than steller digital transfer.
