This movie creeps up on you then grabs you buy the heart and begins to squeeze! ~ ALL the actors, even the minor role ones are just wonderful. I especially liked Michael Angarano. I swear, every dfferent scene, his face is completetly different, and wonderful. The neighborhood and atmosphere made me feel that the Character from the Boy Who Could Fly, woud come zooming down the street, at an moment. My only concern is that Evan Rachel Wood was so terribly thin, which of course did not effect her fantastic character..Also I didnt think I would need a box of kleenex on the couch. So be prepared, because so goes this ever swelling movie, with a very emotional impact. ~Definitely packs a walop ~...My favorite part was the boy that kept on digging up bones he swore were from Dinosaurs.

730324,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00007KK4X,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","Like another recently reviewed film, what irritates the heck out of me is that no one ever hears of films like this. In this case, the date of the film, 2001, gives us a clue as to why it fell through the cracks. After 9-11, no one had much taste for film. Bad timing.Well: GET THIS NOW AND LOVE IT!! Evan Rachel Wood, charmingly willowy and adolescent here, plays a musical prodigy (violin) who moonlights as the neighborhood secret-keeper. She dispenses advice after hearing secrets, ranging from how best to hide the evidence of broken heirlooms to how one can masquerade as one's older sister. All her clients are delightfully under 10 years of age, and great little actors. The little girl who's dying for a collection of real cats and the intrepid autistic boy who finds a Tyrannosaurus Rex while digging to China are the show stealers at this stage of the film. If only the secret keeper can help the girl cope with the cats she's cat-napped, and help the boy decide how to handle his paleontological find!Enter the magnificent Michael Angarano (""Sky High"", ""Forbidden Kingdom""), who is just now hitting his stride as a major star. Lanky and hilarious, with twitches and facial expressions that put the young Shia La Boeuf to shame, he appears as the new guy in town (which is implied to be Somewhere, Florida but is actually Salt Lake City, Utah).With his flippant yet clumsy view of the world, he befriends Evan the Secret Keeper--then the fur flies when they all discover that secrets are not to be taken lightly...or piled steadily onto anyone's shoulders. The film ends beautifully with all the kids and the rest of the characters fessing up, thereby destroying the ugly karmic cycle of secret-keeping.I was moved by a scene early in the film when Evan tells one of the children, ""This isn't confession!""--I roared because that is exactly what it was. It was a place the children could tell their secrets (confess) and get guidance/comfort (absolution). If Catholic priests can't get it right, how on earth did this genuis-IQ 16 year old girl think she could do it?!There is no swearing, and I cannot fathom the stupid PG rating on this G-quality film. (Except to repeat here the immortal words of Emma Thompson, who said that ""a G-rating is the kiss of death for any film."") The performances are charming and real--the kids steal the show but not enough to make them look silly Disney-esque ragamuffin show-stealing.Watch Evan move beautifully, like a young Grace Kelley: nonetheless we do not forget she's a sweet 16. Watch Michael Angarano, who doesn't hide even at this age (12) his beautiful, powerful physical abilites, yet he remains ever the weedy-help-me-I'm-stuck-in-puberty nerd.Toward the end, though we know it all along, this film magnificently soars as a morality play. It sears and pierces the soul somewhat like Shakespeare--if he were alive today, I'll tell you: THIS would be his favorite film.I can say--my wife will agree here--this film elicits laughter, tears and everything in between. Too few films like this, in our modern age dominated by either nonstop brainless action or gratuitous gross-out fests. This movie is rare, absolute fun.",5,Little Secrets Mean Alot If You Show Them Right,1267056000,"02 25, 2010",2010,3174,"['recently', 'reviewed', 'film', 'what', 'heck', 'one', 'ever', 'films', 'case', 'date', 'film', '2001', 'clue', 'why', 'fell', 'cracks', '9-11', 'one', 'had', 'much', 'taste', 'film', 'Bad', 'timing.Well', 'GET', 'THIS', 'NOW', 'AND', 'LOVE', 'IT', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'charmingly', 'willowy', 'adolescent', 'here', 'musical', 'prodigy', 'violin', 'who', 'moonlights', 'neighborhood', 'secret-keeper', 'advice', 'hearing', 'secrets', 'ranging', 'how', 'best', 'hide', 'evidence', 'broken', 'heirlooms', 'how', 'one', 'can', 'masquerade', 'one', 'older', 'sister', 'clients', 'are', 'delightfully', '10', 'years', 'age', 'great', 'little', 'actors', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'dying', 'collection', 'real', 'cats', 'intrepid', 'autistic', 'boy', 'who', 'Tyrannosaurus', 'Rex', 'digging', 'China', 'are', 'show', 'stage', 'film', 'only', 'secret', 'keeper', 'can', 'help', 'girl', 'cope', 'cats', 'cat-napped', 'help', 'boy', 'decide', 'how', 'handle', 'paleontological', 'find', 'Enter', 'magnificent', 'Michael', 'Angarano', 'Sky', 'High', 'Forbidden', 'Kingdom', 'who', 'just', 'now', 'hitting', 'stride', 'major', 'star', 'Lanky', 'hilarious', 'twitches', 'facial', 'expressions', 'put', 'young', 'Shia', 'La', 'Boeuf', 'shame', 'new', 'guy', 'town', 'implied', 'be', 'Somewhere', 'Florida', 'actually', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'Utah', '.With', 'flippant', 'yet', 'clumsy', 'view', 'world', 'Evan', 'Secret', 'Keeper', 'then', 'fur', 'flies', 'when', 'discover', 'secrets', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'piled', 'steadily', 'anyone', 'shoulders', 'film', 'beautifully', 'kids', 'rest', 'characters', 'fessing', 'up', 'thereby', 'destroying', 'ugly', 'karmic', 'cycle', 'secret-keeping.I', 'was', 'moved', 'scene', 'early', 'film', 'when', 'Evan', 'one', 'children', ""n't"", 'confession', 'roared', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'place', 'children', 'could', 'tell', 'secrets', 'confess', 'get', 'guidance/comfort', 'absolution', 'Catholic', 'priests', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'right', 'how', 'earth', 'did', 'genuis-IQ', '16', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'think', 'could', 'do', 'swearing', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'stupid', 'PG', 'rating', 'G-quality', 'film', 'repeat', 'here', 'immortal', 'words', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'said', 'G-rating', 'kiss', 'death', 'film', 'performances', 'are', 'charming', 'real', 'kids', 'steal', 'show', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'look', 'silly', 'Disney-esque', 'ragamuffin', 'show-stealing.Watch', 'Evan', 'move', 'beautifully', 'young', 'Grace', 'Kelley', 'nonetheless', 'do', 'not', 'forget', 'sweet', '16', 'Watch', 'Michael', 'Angarano', 'who', ""n't"", 'hide', 'even', 'age', '12', 'beautiful', 'powerful', 'physical', 'abilites', 'yet', 'ever', ""weedy-help-me-I'm-stuck-in-puberty"", 'nerd.Toward', 'end', 'know', 'along', 'film', 'magnificently', 'morality', 'play', 'soul', 'somewhat', 'like', 'Shakespeare', 'were', 'alive', 'today', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'THIS', 'would', 'be', 'favorite', 'film.I', 'can', 'say', 'wife', 'will', 'agree', 'here', 'film', 'laughter', 'tears', 'everything', 'Too', 'few', 'films', 'modern', 'age', 'dominated', 'nonstop', 'brainless', 'action', 'gratuitous', 'gross-out', 'fests', 'movie', 'rare', 'absolute', 'fun']",N/A

730326,AY12DBB0U420B,B00007KK4X,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Here's a movie that caught me totally by surprise. I'd seen it on my favorite DVD bargain rack for some time, but it just didn't seem like something of interest. Finally, I bought it because there didn't seem to be anything else suitable for viewing and it turned out to be one of the best movies I've viewed this year. The movie was sappy, sugar sweet and squeaky clean, not exactly my usual fare these days. The acting didn't seem particularly good, yet I got caught up in it and ""lived"" the last two thirds of the movie. It was touching, quite touching. The cast and setting presented about the most idealized family and neighborhood you could imagine and the assembly went through their hum-drum daily lives. Now how exciting could this be? Well, it wasn't exciting, at all. It was just a very nice group of everyday people going through their everyday hopes, problems, aspirations, and yes, their little secrets. It's hard to explain. Trust me. You have to experience it.The movie was centered about Emily (Evan Rachel Wood), a teen-aged girl who had a neighborhood kids' business of keeping secrets for fifty cents each. It was a thriving enterprise and was quite a bit like a Catholic Confessional, and seemed to serve the same purpose. Movie-wise, it was a way of introducing the neighborhood kids and, ultimately even a few adults and a way of weaving a simple story together. Very interesting structure. Emily was an aspiring classical musician (violinist) who was trying for a symphony position and achieved it, ultimately, with the help of a couple of her friends. Now that just doesn't seem like the basis for an outstanding movie, but trust me, it was.The setting was excellent, as was the photography. The soundtrack was exceptionally good and the DVD came with a bonus CD of same. I guess the acting was superb too, as was the directing. That is to say, in no place did I notice anything spectacular, but the movie captured me in a wonderful way that I'm not used to being captured and swept me away in the story. Why hasn't this movie achieved more note? It's a wonderful movie that the whole family can enjoy.Gary Peterson",5,Expect To Be Surprised. Quite Touching.

Although it is probably geared towards females ages 7-12, it kept this adult riveted.At the heart of the film is fourteen year old Emily (played by Rachel Wood) who is the neighborhood &quot;secret keeper&quot;, charging a small fee so that the neighborhood children can unload their guilty consciences (and sometimes a broken item or two) with her. Unbeknownst to her young clients, however, Emily has her own secret, a huge one, which she has been hiding for years.Meanwhile, complications ensue as Emily finds that secrets and lie have a way of growing more difficult to hide.All of this unfolds in a very believable way.

While her friends are away at summer camp, Emily becomes a secret keeper. Children who are several years younger than her pay her to listen to their secrets and Emily is very good at keeping a secret. She knew she could do it when she was very young and decided it would be a very marketable skill. Emily also offers advice about  maintaining the secret to the children. When a new family arrive, Emily finds a very close friend and a potential love interest. Of course with friendships and potential relationships come complications, and Emily eventually learns that &quot;to be close to someone you can't keep secrets from them&quot;. Throughout the story, Emily is very good at keeping other people's secrets, but underneath it all she is hiding a big secret all of her own, and that secret is... sorry- it's a secret!When I first put on this DVD I had high expectations. I was expecting something very special like the movie &quot;A Little Princess&quot;. However what I got seemed a lot more like &quot;The Babysitter's Club&quot;.

In fact I rented the movie first before buying it. And also, I'm definitely sure we're gonna be hearing more great things about Evan Rachel Wood.The DVD features a Commentary by writer and director, a short Making-of featurette and a Blooper reel that is actually quite funny.

However, I do want to say what a great film this is! I happened to catch it on one of the cable channels here recently, and although I must admit I've never heard of it before, I was completely won over by this charming film from the very beginning! I found the storyline to be quite original, and there were many valuable lessons to be learned along the way. I'm sure this film was intended for young adults, but I'm much older than that and still enjoyed it very much! In fact, I liked it so much that I just purchased the DVD here on amazon! The cast in this movie couldn't be better, and they all give wonderful performances! Evan Rachel Wood is perfection itself in her role as Emily, and the chemistry between her and the supporting cast easily deserves 5 stars. More recently, Evan  co-starred with Larry David in the Woody Allen film ""Whatever Works"", and I couldn't believe this was the same actress! In ""Little Secrets"", she gives a very charming performance in what is certainly an excellent film for the entire family. In ""Whatever Works"", she gives a first rate comedy perfomance. After seeing these two films, I also checked out her break-through role in the movie ""Thirteen"", and saw still another side of Evan's great talent.

730332,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B00007KK4X,Only-A-Child,"[5, 7]","David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" starts with some great images: ideal suburbia - kids crossing the street, firemen waving as they go down the road on their truck, and a man watering his garden. Then the guy has a stroke and collapses. We are then treated to the best shot of the film: his dog playfully jumping around the squirting hose he continues to hold as a toddler ambles toward him. Then the camera moves down for a macro shot of the insect world in his lawn, introducing the film's theme that there is a secret and much nastier world just below the surface of ""Norman Rockwell"" suburbia.In ""Little Secrets"", Emily runs a business which keeps all the neighborhood secrets in a safe place for a fee. It takes Lynch's dark theme and turns it into a lesson about friendship and trust. Apparently this thematic content is the reason the film was given a PG rating, although it is hard to imagine that anyone would think this film required ""parental guidance"".The film features a decent performance from Evan Rachel Wood (Emily), although there is nothing here that would lead anyone to think she was capable of her breakout performance in ""Thirteen"". Michael Angarano (Phillip) is fantastic opposite Wood and they have a nice chemistry. David Gallagher does a good job in a small role that is unnecessarily tacked onto the story, presumably to capitalize on his ""7th Heaven"" popularly. Blair Treu, the film's director, should have recognized in mid-production that a better resolution would have been the pairing of Emily and Phillip rather than Emily and David. It was an easy fix, minor rewrites and re-shooting a couple scenes to make Phillip the same age as Emily, they certainly look the same age. Gallagher's drawing power did not save the production commercially (it tanked big time at the box office) so they ruined the ending for nothing.The director of photography used a lot of great crane shots and creative camera angles but overall the the shots should have been tighter (i.e. closer shots of the faces and eyes). One exception was Caitlin E. J. Meyer (Isabelle) who the camera loves and who steals her scenes as the nine-year old younger sister of Emily's best friend. Isabelle has the movie's best line ""Life is complicated when you look like Claudia Schiffer"".This is a very original premise, a well-conceived and rather profound story. It should really appeal to those who liked ""The Boy Who Could Fly"" and ""Harriet The Spy"".There is one especially good scene when the web of secrets starts to crumble. First Emily is angry at David because he was caught drinking which was his secret, making David angry at Phillip for telling Emily his secret, which makes Phillip angry at Emily for telling David that he had told her David's secret.

730335,A18ECWTWII1KSU,B00007KK4X,susannah,"[1, 2]","I am really surprised there are are no reviews for this film as yet. Evan Rachel Wood is immensely talented and shines here. While the point of the film is that honesty is the best policy, which is true, there is a difference between ""honesty"" and matters that are private and no one else's business. This difference was not shown. Wood plays a sensitive, intelligent, compassionate 14 year old whose parents are having a baby. Of course an impending birth is exciting but it seemed to me that to the parents, it was all about the baby, and treated Emily like some kind of distant afterthought, even in  an accident. The two neighbor boys, Phil and David, seemed to have absolutely no sense of boundaries or respecting Emily's privacy, from ransacking her room to following her to treating her like an object, that they were ""giving"" to each other, or ""capturing"" for themselves, to the point of creepiness. This should not be presented to the girls seeing this film as acceptable behavior from boys. Girls should be allowed to choose to spend time together without an uninvited boy intruding or being called ""flakes."" Boys should not walk into a girl's home and watch her as she thinks she is alone, or break into her room and go through her things, without permission, as was done several times, to two girls. I just think that a film for pre and young teens should try harder to impart healthier values. I really would like to know what other people think.",3,Wood is great.
