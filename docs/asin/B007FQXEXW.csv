I have to wonder if Ty Cobb was really that bad as he is portrayed. But Tommie Lee Jones's earlier days of cinema were indeed very raw and vulgar. He has softened with age and now is easier to watch. Space Cowboys being my favorite. The other two movies fall somewhere in between.",3,Good ones and not so good ones,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,388,"['Ty', 'Cobb', 'movie', 'was', 'horrible', 'Too', 'vulgar', 'suppose', 'appeals', 'certain', 'people', 'rawness', 'have', 'wonder', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'was', 'really', 'that', 'bad', 'portrayed', 'Tommie', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'earlier', 'days', 'cinema', 'were', 'indeed', 'very', 'raw', 'vulgar', 'softened', 'age', 'now', 'easier', 'watch', 'Space', 'Cowboys', 'being', 'favorite', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'fall', 'somewhere']","4 Film Favorites: Tommy Lee Jones (U.S. Marshals, The Client, Space Cowboys, Cobb)"
