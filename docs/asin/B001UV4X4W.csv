Sure I chuckled a few times, but in the end I was left scratching my head and asking, ""Did I really just sit through that?""  The lead characters Eugene (Zach Cregger) and Tucker (Trevor Moore) were over the top at times and obnoxiously whiney at others.  How many times can two guys scream like girls?The only part that was decent was the cameo Hefner gave.  As another poster stated he gave a good performance (or just acted as himself) and delivers a simple explanation about how to treat women.I guess with these movies it's hit or miss and this one just missed for me.

E Jackson,"[3, 4]","This is one of those kind of comedies that's easy to dismiss as pure, immature garbage, but...I was laughing while watching it, so it's hard to really hate a movie like this.You know how it is- you think a movie absolutely stinks, but you keep watching it anyway because you find it funny?You don't *want* to laugh because secretly you know it's bottom of the barrel comedy... but you continue watching despite that.  Yeah you get the point.  It's one of *those* kind of films.The amount of vulgar scenes you will witness in Miss March is incredibly high. This is NOT a movie for kids- this is strictly humor intended for young adults.A young man plans to have his first sexual experience with a girl a magical one, and on prom night, but while he's getting ready to head for her bedroom, he takes a wrong turn down the basement stairs, falling down, and a toolbox hits him on the head before the entire cabinet comes crashing down on top of him.  Talk about a rough night.Four years later, he wakes up in the hospital room, and let me just say his friend (who totally reminds me of WWE wrestler Edge) is the main character in the film, and he's a complete moron.  No matter what he does, everything he does is wrong.  He's goofy, immature, and gross.  Hey, we all know people like that in real life, haha.  His friend however (the one who wakes up in the hospital) is the complete opposite of that- he's more respectable and treats women with dignity.Anyway, we find out the girlfriend of the young man who awakes in the hospital has found a career as a model at the Playboy mansion, so the two friends take a ride to the west coast in search for his girlfriend.THIS is when the story really gets going, and the two of them go on some amazing adventures while traveling around the country, usually really moronic adventures that involve making trouble with people they shouldn't be messing with.Overall, a really funny film.

Eugene is a very straight young man; he and his girlfriend give abstinence lectures to middle school children and he is intelligent. Tucker is the dumb one; he acts on impulse, verbally and physically. It shortly before prom night and Eugene's girlfriend tells him that she will have sex with him after the prom. They arrive at a house where a wild party is commencing and while his girlfriend goes upstairs to prepare, Tucker convinces Eugene to have some shots of whiskey to get him relaxed for the deed.However, after his preparation, instead of going upstairs, Eugene falls down the basement stairs and into a four-year coma. He is finally revived by Tucker hitting him in the nose with a baseball bat and Eugene discovers that he has little control over his legs and bowels. This part is more than a little gross and things get even stupider when Tucker discovers that Eugene's girlfriend is Playboy magazine's Miss March.Abandoned by his parents, Eugene has no place to go and he is taken by Tucker on a cross-country trip to the Playboy mansion in California so that Eugene can see his girlfriend again. They have very little money, Tucker is being pursued by a vindictive girlfriend and a series of fire departments and Eugene has yet to regain full control of his bowels. The stupidity and grossness continue throughout their journey and severely strain the patience and tolerance of the viewer. It reaches the point where it is simply boring to watch Tucker say or do one more stupid thing. Slapstick based on uncontrolled bowel action also gets old and smelly very quick.There is a bit of reprieve at the end, but that is not enough to save this from being one big and continuous stupid movie.",1,"One of the crudest, stupidest movies of all time",1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,1823,"['movie', 'based', 'fundamental', 'premise', 'dumb', 'young', 'male', 'Eugene', 'Tucker', 'are', 'high', 'school', 'best', 'friends', 'Eugene', 'very', 'straight', 'young', 'man', 'girlfriend', 'give', 'abstinence', 'lectures', 'middle', 'school', 'children', 'intelligent', 'Tucker', 'dumb', 'one', 'impulse', 'verbally', 'physically', 'shortly', 'prom', 'night', 'Eugene', 'girlfriend', 'will', 'have', 'sex', 'prom', 'arrive', 'house', 'where', 'wild', 'party', 'commencing', 'girlfriend', 'upstairs', 'prepare', 'Tucker', 'Eugene', 'have', 'shots', 'whiskey', 'get', 'relaxed', 'deed.However', 'preparation', 'instead', 'going', 'upstairs', 'Eugene', 'down', 'basement', 'stairs', 'four-year', 'coma', 'finally', 'revived', 'Tucker', 'hitting', 'nose', 'baseball', 'bat', 'Eugene', 'discovers', 'little', 'control', 'legs', 'bowels', 'part', 'more', 'little', 'gross', 'things', 'get', 'even', 'stupider', 'when', 'Tucker', 'Eugene', 'girlfriend', 'Playboy', 'magazine', 'Miss', 'March.Abandoned', 'parents', 'Eugene', 'place', 'go', 'taken', 'Tucker', 'cross-country', 'trip', 'Playboy', 'mansion', 'California', 'Eugene', 'can', 'see', 'girlfriend', 'again', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'money', 'Tucker', 'being', 'pursued', 'vindictive', 'girlfriend', 'series', 'fire', 'departments', 'Eugene', 'yet', 'regain', 'full', 'control', 'bowels', 'stupidity', 'grossness', 'continue', 'journey', 'severely', 'strain', 'patience', 'tolerance', 'viewer', 'point', 'where', 'simply', 'boring', 'watch', 'Tucker', 'say', 'do', 'one', 'more', 'stupid', 'thing', 'Slapstick', 'based', 'uncontrolled', 'bowel', 'action', 'also', 'old', 'smelly', 'very', 'quick.There', 'bit', 'reprieve', 'end', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'being', 'one', 'big', 'continuous', 'stupid', 'movie']",Miss March

Lots of people will probably watch it due to the Playboy angle, then wonder why they wasted their time. Maybe if you watch this while seriously drunk, you won't care.It's totally absurd and if you feel like wasting your time foolishly, this fits the bill.If a bunch of school drop outs managed to make a better film with pocket change,  in their spare time, I wouldn't be surprised.This film obviously had a lavish budget and it's a clear example of money over taste.

Whitest Kids U'Know was a fine show and comedy troupe, and directors Trevor and Zach has a decent enough comedic talents, but it seems like they reached their limit in how capable they can pull off a feature-length film.  It's repulsive, the jokes were boring, and the characters antics get tiresome after way; the film seems more effective as a ten-minute sketch than anything else.It did started off strong.  Not so much with the premise, which is about Eugene (Zach) who got into a four-year coma and found out by his bumbling friend Tucker (Trevor) that his girlfriend is a playboy bunny so they're on a road trip to get her back, but the wackiness that initially gave way.  The first 15 minutes were hilarious, ranging from the bizarre abstinence speech to how Eugene got out of the coma; they have good timing and delivery on those ideas.  As the plot goes on, however, the movie progressive got less funny.  The way the jokes set-up became predictable and clich&eacute;, more emphasis is on shock humor, overused facial gags, I had the feeling the movie was becoming lazy.  None of the humor and tact mean anyone, and the characters don't bother to make themselves more interesting than their gags.  Trevor, the bumbling sexist apathetic buddy, got on my nerves when he goes through with the same clueless gag over and over again.The directors just struggle to make a basic story work, and it felt padded despite the 95 minute run.  It feels less like an homage to screwball road trip films and more like a halfhearted attempt of a screwball road trip film.

1239530,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001UV4X4W,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I was truly expecting to hate the DVD MISS MARCH. I mean the previews had some honestly funny moments in them that made me laugh out loud but those usually mean that the best scenes of the film have been seen already and the rest is drek. I was pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong, this isn't LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, but it is an entertaining comedy.Eugene Bell (Zach Cregger) and Cyndi Whitehall (Raquel Alessi) are two high school seniors who have strongly adopted the wait until your married vow of celibacy. They go to middle schools and preach this to younger kids (in the first of many hilarious moments). But the big night of prom is around the corner and Cyndi wants the two of them to show their love physically, insisting until Eugene gives in.The night arrives and of course Eugene turns to his best friend Tucker Cleigh (Trevor Moore) for advice. Best friends forever, Tucker has become the class lout, attempting to bed any and every female in sight. This doesn't mean he succeeds, it just means he wants to. Who better to give Eugene advice, right?They all arrive at the big party. Cyndi goes upstairs to get ready. Tucker begins to fuel Eugene's fire and calm his nerve with alcohol. And in a drunken stupor, Eugene heads to meet his destiny with Cyndi...only to take a wrong door and fall down the stairs, landing at the bottom and having a tool case land on his head, placing him in a coma for 4 years.Four years later Tucker wakes Eugene using the same method, a huge smack to the head. Grateful to be awake at first, Eugene discovers life isn't that great for him at the moment. Between atrophied muscles, no bowel control, his parents forgetting about him in the hospital and apparently Tucker being the only person who cares, he then discovers that Cyndi is not a playmate, Miss March.The two make plans to get Eugene back in shape and then head out to find Cyndi and discover what happened. Those plans are tossed into immediate gear when a problem between Tucker and his girlfriend (one of the funniest sight gags in the film) results in his having to leave town with her hot on his trail along with fire fighters across the country. Her brother is a fire fighter and according to Tucker, they're all crazy and side together.The pair head out on their road trip and have one problem after another slow them down. Not since Steve Martin and John Candy hit the road in PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES has a duo had this many problems. The pair hitches a ride with an old high school chum named Horsedick.mpeg (Craig Robinson) who's become a celebrity in his own right, a huge rap star. The songs he offers on view here as well as accompanying videos may be raunchy but they are hilarious as well.Hopping on board the party buss, Horsedick insists that Eugene lose his virginity on the way. It's a party bus and he wants nothing but partying going on. Enter one of the funniest moments seen in the trailer that still gets a laugh here, the result of which finds Tucker and Eugene tossed off the bus in the middle of the desert. Fortunately a pair of nympho lesbians picks the pair up asking them to drive while they make out in the back.Then more trouble comes up. But eventually the boys make their way to the coast and to Tucker's Holy Grail, the Playboy mansion! Cyndi is supposed to be there at a big party and the duo now just need to find a way in. Can they do so? Will Eugene find out what went wrong between him and Cyndi? Will Tucker discover that the years he's spent studying the Playboy lifestyle in the pages of the magazine pay off or were they just a hoax?The only way to see is to watch this DVD and get a chuckle in the process. The film falls into the category of crude humor films and if you walk in aware of this you'll find plenty to laugh at. If you found everything from ANIMAL HOUSE to ROAD TRIP funny then you'll love this one.Movies like this are not so much about the acting as the humor involved. Sure these characters aren't believable but admit it, there was someone you knew somewhere alone the way just like Tucker. The guy who thought that every word found in Playboy was true. The guy who thought if he knew the likes and dislikes of women he'd have his way with them all.While there are moments between the characters here that are goofy and laced in laughs, there are also moments where you truly see an affection between them. Not just the dynamic duo on the road but Cyndi and Eugene as well. And words of wisdom are also offered by none other than Hugh Hefner himself in a send up of his own empire and self description.If you're looking for a good time, a laugh and not easily offended then you'll like this film. While this is juvenile humor, it's not for juveniles. Definitely not for the kids. So send them to bed, pop the DVD in and then try and stifle the laughter so you don't wake them up. It won't be an easy task.When judging the star rating for this one I was on the verge of giving it 3 stars. The only reason to jump to 4 was that yes, I'd watch this one again. Will everyone else? I'm not sure. It depends on your sense of humor so judge for yourself. But it is worth watching at least once.",4,POST TRAUMA LOVE,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,5163,"['was', 'truly', 'expecting', 'hate', 'DVD', 'MISS', 'MARCH', 'mean', 'previews', 'had', 'honestly',

The only reason I finished this movie was because I paid $5.99 to get it on demand from Comcast and at least wanted to get my money's worth, even though it was still a complete waste of money.Do yourself the favor and don't buy this movie. Rent it and you will see why. You will even thank every one that wrote a negative review about this movie which prevented you from buying it. If you really want to see it, waste the $5.99, but trust me, dont spend anymore than that. The movie is bad even for bad movies. This movie gives bad movies a bad name.",1,Absolutely Horrible!

In the interim we get treated to plenty of diarrhea, old sight gags, boring writing, unfunny jokes, and lengthy diatribe that would have been funny ten years ago. I can laugh at good fire service jokes, but the whole psychotic, sexless firemen gag running throughout the film was lame - and it would be nice if one film would actually show how the pumpers really work (sans the Con Air, Evolution, Miss March incorrectness)The Blu pic is actually decent through most of the film, though delving into the B grade quality stock through several indoor sequences. Nothing to test the visuals as the cross country footage entails all of 30 seconds so that leaves the sound and supplements. The sound is uneventful and the supplements cater to the Whitest Kids U Know crowd.The Viral Videos offering is a staged audition sequence that does not entertain much, but as stated the fans that have been renting the TV series are asking about this. The Down & Dirty uncensored (or edited option) allowed Craig Robinson (Pineapple Express, Zack & Miri, etc.) to have more of the only fun in the movie with his rapping video clip.I have to admit Hugh Hefner has a natural screen presence and his 60 second sequence was actually appropriate - it appears he does not have to act, it just comes naturally, as does his explanation about how to treat women; skip the movie and just watch that one part.The unrated is only 3:10 minutes longer and had nothing special to offer over the rated. I did verify they dubbed over the school speech in both versions, so I am curious what she was actually saying that they had to change it.

1239541,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001UV4X4W,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[8, 15]","Miss March utilizes both lewd gags and random bursts of imbecilic humor, and this style of comedy will easily appeal to some and completely disgust others.  If you've jumped aboard the recent gross-out comedy bandwagon, characterized by short bouts of real humor sandwiched between squalidly immoral excesses, the first feature film from the creators of The Whitest Kids You Know might just be your cup of tea, though the sum of its parts can't maintain the quality of the popular sketch comedy show.On Prom night, minutes before he's about to lose his virginity to longtime girlfriend Cindi (Raquel Alessi), Eugene (Cregger) falls down a flight of stairs and winds up in a coma.  Four years pass and the bewildered youth awakens to find that all of his friends and family have abandoned him, except for his maniacal, sex-obsessed buddy Tucker (Moore).  Together the mismatched duo embarks on a desperately deranged road trip to the Playboy Mansion to reunite the traumatized youth with Cindi, who is now Playmate of the Month.Vulgar comedy only surpasses its simplicities when the characters involved are actually relatable or worthy of our sympathy.  The immature humor found throughout Miss March falls a little shorter than its true recycled nature due to the two main protagonists and their overly despicable presentations.  Neither straight man Eugene nor funny man Tucker succeed in overcoming their annoyingly expected stereotyped traits and every attempt at redemption falls on eyes blinded by indifference.Perhaps what's most impressive about Miss March is the amount of questionable activities the creators manage to squeeze into an R-rated film. It's done in a comedic, unrealistic manner, but ""pushing the envelope"" isn't a phrase extreme enough to accurately describe some of the taboo endeavors. Sadly, the gratuitous female nudity expected from a film shot at the Playboy Mansion and replicating a full-blown Hugh Hefner party is minimal, forcing the obnoxious and insufficient buffoonery to be relied upon much too heavily.- The Massie Twins",2,Miss March Movie Review from The Massie Twins,1236816000,"03 12, 2009",2009,2058,"['Miss', 'March', 'lewd', 'gags', 'random', 'bursts', 'imbecilic', 'humor', 'style', 'comedy', 'will', 'easily', 'appeal', 'completely', 'disgust', 'others', ""'ve"", 'jumped', 'recent', 'gross-out', 'comedy', 'bandwagon', 'characterized', 'short', 'bouts', 'real', 'humor', 'sandwiched', 'squalidly', 'immoral', 'excesses', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'creators', 'Whitest', 'Kids', 'Know', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'sum', 'parts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'maintain', 'quality', 'popular', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'show.On', 'Prom', 'night', 'minutes', 'lose', 'virginity', 'longtime', 'girlfriend', 'Cindi', 'Raquel', 'Alessi', 'Eugene', 'Cregger', 'down', 'flight', 'stairs', 'up', 'coma', 'Four', 'years', 'pass', 'bewildered', 'youth', 'awakens', 'find', 'friends', 'family', 'have', 'abandoned', 'maniacal', 'sex-obsessed', 'buddy', 'Tucker', 'Moore', 'mismatched', 'duo', 'embarks', 'desperately', 'deranged', 'road', 'trip', 'Playboy', 'Mansion', 'reunite', 'traumatized', 'youth', 'Cindi', 'who', 'now', 'Playmate', 'Month.Vulgar', 'comedy', 'only', 'simplicities', 'when', 'characters', 'involved', 'are', 'actually', 'relatable', 'worthy', 'sympathy', 'immature', 'humor', 'found', 'Miss', 'March', 'little', 'shorter', 'true', 'recycled', 'nature', 'due', 'two', 'main', 'protagonists', 'overly', 'despicable', 'presentations', 'straight', 'man', 'Eugene', 'funny', 'man', 'Tucker', 'succeed', 'overcoming', 'annoyingly', 'expected', 'stereotyped', 'traits', 'attempt', 'redemption', 'falls', 'eyes', 'blinded', 'indifference.Perhaps', 'what', 'most', 'impressive', 'Miss', 'March', 'amount', 'questionable', 'activities', 'creators', 'manage', 'squeeze', 'R-rated', 'film', 'done', 'comedic', 'unrealistic', 'manner', 'pushing', 'envelope', ""n't"", 'phrase', 'extreme', 'enough', 'accurately', 'describe', 'taboo', 'endeavors', 'Sadly', 'gratuitous', 'female', 'nudity', 'expected', 'film', 'shot', 'Playboy', 'Mansion', 'replicating', 'full-blown', 'Hugh', 'Hefner', 'party', 'minimal', 'forcing', 'obnoxious', 'insufficient', 'buffoonery', 'be', 'relied', 'much', 'too', 'heavily.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",Miss March
