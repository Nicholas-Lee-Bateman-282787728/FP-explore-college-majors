Many individuals who are somehow connected (family ties, friendship, love) reunite on a train in order to attend a funeral of a loved(?) one. During the process, shades of the past unfold and old wounds appear again, making for some dramatic moments and tense situations. A low-key, subtle and realistic cinematic experience, &quot;Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train&quot; offers a solid character study with convincing acting and a stellar soundtrack (P.J. Harvey, Jeff Buckley, Portishead, Cake,...). It`s an uneven movie, though, as some scenes drag a bit, the connections between a couple of characters aren`t quite clear and the ending could be better. Still, this picture is worthwile overall and suceeds at presenting a melancholic and urban look into dysfunctional families.Good cinema.",3,Take This Train,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",2004,954,"['interesting', 'compelling', 'movie', 'Patrice', 'Chereau', 's', 'quot', 'Intimacy', 'quot', 'effort', 'deep', 'subdued', 'story', 'different', 'kinds', 'relationships', 'Many', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'somehow', 'connected', 'family', 'ties', 'friendship', 'love', 'reunite', 'train', 'order', 'attend', 'funeral', 'loved', 'one', 'process', 'shades', 'past', 'unfold', 'old', 'wounds', 'appear', 'again', 'making', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'tense', 'situations', 'low-key', 'subtle', 'realistic', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'quot', 'Who', 'Love', 'Me', 'Can', 'Take', 'Train', 'quot', 'solid', 'character', 'study', 'convincing', 'acting', 'stellar', 'soundtrack', 'P.J', 'Harvey', 'Jeff', 'Buckley', 'Portishead', 'Cake', 's', 'uneven', 'movie', 'though', 'scenes', 'drag', 'bit', 'connections', 'couple', 'characters', 'aren', 't', 'quite', 'clear', 'ending', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'Still', 'picture', 'worthwile', 'overall', 'suceeds', 'presenting', 'melancholic', 'urban', 'look', 'dysfunctional', 'families.Good', 'cinema']",Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train
479654,A328S9RN3U5M68,6305811555,Grady Harp,"[7, 8]","THOSE WHO LOVE ME CAN TAKE THE TRAIN to the burial of an enigmatic French artist by the name of Jean Baptiste. In this frenzied examination of contemporary living creatures who all board a claustrophobic train on its way to Limoges, France, director Patrice Chereau dissects the psyches of the most disparate group of family and friends ever gathered to pay last rites.  A married couple in the midst of dissolution, a gay couple who discover a shared paramour whose health status threatens their lives, a transexual current amour of the dead man, a long time male nurse of the deceased, and others whose identities remain slightly out of focus - all of these characters have personal baggage they bring to this memorial ""reunion"" and it is the interplay of thier interrelated attachments to the deceased that alters their lives.  There are problems with the film - the subtitles are difficult to read, the soundtrack often covers the dialogue, the pace is a bit disarming - but in all it is very much like the way Chereau approaches opera (the vocal sound tract is in English, the dialogue in French with only sporadic English, the grand emotional music is from Gustav Mahler).  He asks us to step back and experience the interior lives of the people around us.  Perhaps this film is an acquired taste, but give it some time and investment of thought and you'll be richly rewarded.",4,"Uncomfortable, tough but ultimately extremely satisfying",1035244800,"10 22, 2002",2002,1382,"['THOSE', 'WHO', 'LOVE', 'ME', 'CAN', 'TAKE', 'THE', 'TRAIN', 'burial', 'enigmatic', 'French', 'artist', 'name', 'Jean', 'Baptiste', 'frenzied', 'examination', 'contemporary', 'living', 'creatures', 'who', 'board', 'claustrophobic', 'train', 'way', 'Limoges', 'France', 'director', 'Patrice', 'Chereau', 'psyches', 'most', 'disparate', 'group', 'family', 'friends', 'ever', 'gathered', 'pay', 'last', 'rites', 'married', 'couple', 'midst', 'dissolution', 'gay', 'couple', 'who', 'shared', 'paramour', 'health', 'status', 'lives', 'transexual', 'current', 'amour', 'dead', 'man', 'long', 'time', 'male', 'nurse', 'deceased', 'others', 'identities', 'remain', 'slightly', 'focus', 'characters', 'have', 'personal', 'baggage', 'bring', 'memorial', 'reunion', 'interplay', 'thier', 'interrelated', 'attachments', 'deceased', 'alters', 'lives', 'are', 'problems', 'film', 'subtitles', 'are', 'difficult', 'read', 'soundtrack', 'often', 'dialogue', 'pace', 'bit', 'disarming', 'very', 'much', 'way', 'Chereau', 'opera', 'vocal', 'sound', 'tract', 'English', 'dialogue', 'French', 'only', 'sporadic', 'English', 'grand', 'emotional', 'music', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'step', 'back', 'experience', 'interior', 'lives', 'people', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'acquired', 'taste', 'give', 'time', 'investment', 'thought', ""'ll"", 'be', 'richly', 'rewarded']",Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train

""Can't understand anything, too complicated"" I must agree that it is complicated, but worth it. At some times, it is hard to recognize the characters and their background (there are many characters and the intrigue unveils itself very slowly), but the movie deals with strong emotions. Mainly, it shows everybody's need to feel recognized by those they love and the competition they go through to get more love and attention.The shots on board the train were well done; there was a good sense of movement all through. Even after the funeral - and no trains, this was sustained.I was amused at Jean-Batiste's desire for everyone who loved him to go by train, but his coffin to be transported by car - and did have to ask if those who came to the funeral by car did it from lack of love for the dear departed or from geographical necessity. I enjoyed this film more than I expected to; it was well paced, the characters were compelling, if not exactly your average circle of family and friends.The standard of acting was generally very good. I feel this film justifies watching more than once, if only to sort out who's who and where they fit together, but, from first viewing, plenty of life, despite being based round a death.",4,"This film is strangely Robert ""Altmanish"" in texture and characterization",1137801600,"01 21, 2006",2006,1295,"['loved', 'hated', 'heard', 'strong', 'comments', 'sides', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'anything', 'too', 'complicated', 'must', 'agree', 'complicated', 'times', 'hard', 'recognize', 'characters', 'background', 'are', 'many', 'characters', 'intrigue', 'very', 'slowly', 'movie', 'deals', 'strong', 'emotions', 'Mainly', 'everybody', 'need', 'feel', 'recognized', 'love', 'competition', 'go', 'get', 'more', 'love', 'attention.The', 'shots', 'board', 'train', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'good', 'sense', 'movement', 'Even', 'funeral', 'trains', 'was', 'sustained.I', 'was', 'amused', 'Jean-Batiste', 'desire', 'everyone', 'who', 'loved', 'go', 'train', 'coffin', 'be', 'transported', 'car', 'did', 'have', 'ask', 'who', 'came', 'funeral', 'car', 'did', 'lack', 'love', 'dear', 'departed', 'geographical', 'necessity', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'expected', 'was', 'well', 'paced', 'characters', 'were', 'compelling', 'not', 'exactly', 'average', 'circle', 'family', 'friends.The', 'standard', 'acting', 'was', 'generally', 'very', 'good', 'feel', 'film', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'only', 'sort', 'out', 'who', 'who', 'where', 'fit', 'together', 'first', 'viewing', 'plenty', 'life', 'being', 'based', 'death']",Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train
