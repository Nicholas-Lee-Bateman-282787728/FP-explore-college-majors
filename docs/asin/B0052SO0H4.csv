Never mind the fact that it's an alleged ""Lifetime cult classic,"" whatever that means.  This movie is over the top and unintentionally funny.  Ivan Sergei plays Billy Jones, and he's just a boy who can't take no for an answer no matter how many times he hears it.  What does he do?  He kills the first blond bobbed girl and buries her, Donnie Osmond hair and all.  Two years later he has reinvented himself with the Harry Connick, Jr. look as a pre-med student, having stolen another boy's identity, Kevin Shane, whom he also makes disappear.  Gosh, but he's just such a magician, it's amazing his name wasn't David Copperfield!  This time around he chases a naive Laurel, played by a red-haired Tori Spelling, and she looks ten times better with it that color.  Oh, well, he convinces her to chop it off in a blond bob (oo-wee-oo!), then slowly begins to alienate her from friends and her mother.  He is possessive, domineering, and virtually imprisons her with his smothering ways, not entirely unlike a large percentage of males out there, except he's worse.  He says stupid, corny, creepy things, making the viewer feel a) they were better off watching Saw or b) maybe Rocky's Horrible Picture Show wasn't so bad after all.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Okay, so you just knew in the ""epic climax"" that Tori would save the day with a boat oar before Billy-Kevin-Prescott-Tickle Me Elmo-Whatever kills her mommy, and you just knew he didn't drown.  Oh, gee, we did NOT see this coming, because Lifetime hasn't trampled this unsacred ground of a theme to death or anything.  Ivan Sergei sure is nice looking, but he can't act, and this is a typical role where Tori by any other name is still Tori.  The ending is quite hilarious, because he's picked up another bobbed blond, this time his name is Prescott (Yuch!), and now he's running around with hair that is eerily similar to the young Colin Blunstone.*****END OF SPOILER*****This movie is so bad it's a laugh a minute, but the strange thing is that it's hard to turn off for the unintended entertainment value.  I say get it on that basis.  After all, being stalked really is no laughing matter, but this movie sure is.  Buy it on the cheap, though.  All in all, it's pretty fun.",3,Verging on Hilarious Camp.,1318118400,"10 9, 2011",2011,2329,"['title', 'star', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'already', 'have', 'idea', 'what', ""'re"", 'Never', 'mind', 'fact', 'alleged', 'Lifetime', 'cult', 'classic', 'movie', 'top', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'Ivan', 'Sergei', 'Billy', 'Jones', 'just', 'boy', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'answer', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'What', 'do', 'first', 'blond', 'bobbed', 'girl', 'Donnie', 'Osmond', 'hair', 'Two', 'years', 'later', 'reinvented', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'look', 'pre-med', 'student', 'having', 'stolen', 'boy', 'identity', 'Kevin', 'Shane', 'whom', 'also', 'disappear', 'Gosh', 'just', 'such', 'magician', 'amazing', 'name', 'was', ""n't"", 'David', 'Copperfield', 'time', 'naive', 'Laurel', 'played', 'red-haired', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'color', 'Oh', 'well', 'chop', 'off', 'blond', 'bob', 'oo-wee-oo', 'then', 'slowly', 'alienate', 'friends', 'mother', 'possessive', 'domineering', 'virtually', 'imprisons', 'smothering', 'ways', 'not', 'entirely', 'large', 'percentage', 'males', 'there', 'worse', 'stupid', 'corny', 'creepy', 'things', 'making', 'viewer', 'feel', 'were', 'better', 'off', 'watching', 'Saw', 'b', 'maybe', 'Rocky', 'Horrible', 'Picture', 'Show', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', '*****SPOILER', 'ALERT*****Okay', 'just', 'knew', 'epic', 'climax', 'Tori', 'would', 'save', 'day', 'boat', 'oar', 'Billy-Kevin-Prescott-Tickle', 'Me', 'Elmo-Whatever', 'mommy', 'just', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'drown', 'Oh', 'gee', 'did', 'NOT', 'see', 'coming', 'Lifetime', ""n't"", 'trampled', 'unsacred', 'ground', 'theme', 'death', 'anything', 'Ivan', 'Sergei', 'sure', 'nice', 'looking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'typical', 'role', 'where', 'Tori', 'other', 'name', 'still', 'Tori', 'ending', 'quite', 'hilarious', 'picked', 'up', 'bobbed', 'blond', 'time', 'name', 'Prescott', 'Yuch', 'now', 'running', 'around', 'hair', 'eerily', 'similar', 'young', 'Colin', 'Blunstone', '*****END', 'SPOILER*****This', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'laugh', 'minute', 'strange', 'thing', 'hard', 'turn', 'off', 'unintended', 'entertainment', 'value', 'say', 'get', 'basis', 'being', 'stalked', 'really', 'laughing', 'matter', 'movie', 'sure', 'Buy', 'cheap', 'though', 'pretty', 'fun']","Mother, May I Sleep With Danger"
