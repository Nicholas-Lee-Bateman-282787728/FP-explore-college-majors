Adrian Pasdar's performance as lethal executive Jim Profit is magnificent evil and carnal lust in a polished, yuppie, corporate mode. Each of the episodes brings Profit closer to a one man corporate take-over the old fashioned way -- by killing off the competition, and climbing the upwardly mobile ladder corpse by corpse. Black humor abounds in this television series too dark for most.  Outstanding performances by the entire supporting cast, but it's Adrian Pasdar's show, esp. at the end of the day as Jim Profit climbs back into a Grayson and Grayson box after a hard day at the office...chilling and adult. Definitely not what the networks wanted.

Profit offers the viewer inside the mind and actions of a sociopath acting out his agenda managing upward, downward, and sideways in a glamorous corporate landscape. Profit is a brutally handsome morally ambiguous sociopath who has memorized how a caring person appears: to some he offers a kind of kindness, to others he sees only tools. Yet he quotes from classics of human observation in literature like a tridium student. You half expect him to start speaking in Latin. This is a hint of why the series is not so advanced after all.Yes, the main character is evil, but also relatively so. Every other character is evil too but in a contrasting lightweight measure and with obvious reasons and motivations. Profit's motives are as hidden and chambered away as a puzzle box.But there are two pieces from which the authors constructed this series. Obviously the author's paint box of sociopaths is always fertile field (a handsome young Hannibal Lecter in a Hugo Boss suit), and corporate greed was high on the agenda in the 90s in the wake of ""Silence of the Lambs"" ""Wall Street"" and the Milken era. Let's give them a ""no-brainer"" for picking that character and backdrop.The second influence is less obvious, but it is television's forgotten first controversial series with challenging and morally ambiguous agendas driven by sociopathology: PBS's ""I, Cladius."" Somehow, everyone dressed in robes softened the blow of the pure evil agendas and cruelty of nearly all the characters. And after the first episodes, incest was only the mildest of shocks. Anyone who enjoys Profit (and I certainly did) and want to see how the story would have turned out can comfort themselves by purchasing the I Claudius series.",5,"""I, Cladius"" REDUX told from Nero's perspective",1167696000,"01 2, 2007",2007,1841,"['first', 'appearance', 'Profit', 'was', 'light', 'years', 'ahead', 'time', 'when', 'first', 'aired', '1996', 'yet', 'forgotten', 'echo', 'past', 'Profit', 'viewer', 'mind', 'actions', 'sociopath', 'acting', 'out', 'agenda', 'managing', 'upward', 'downward', 'sideways', 'glamorous', 'corporate', 'landscape', 'Profit', 'brutally', 'handsome', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'sociopath', 'who', 'memorized', 'how', 'caring', 'person', 'kind', 'kindness', 'others', 'only', 'tools', 'classics', 'human', 'observation', 'literature', 'tridium', 'student', 'half', 'expect', 'start', 'speaking', 'Latin', 'hint', 'why', 'series', 'not', 'so', 'advanced', 'all.Yes', 'main', 'character', 'evil', 'also', 'relatively', 'so', 'other', 'character', 'evil', 'too', 'contrasting', 'lightweight', 'measure', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'motivations', 'Profit', 'motives', 'are', 'hidden', 'chambered', 'away', 'puzzle', 'box.But', 'are', 'two', 'pieces', 'authors', 'constructed', 'series', 'Obviously', 'author', 'paint', 'box', 'sociopaths', 'always', 'fertile', 'field', 'handsome', 'young', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Hugo', 'Boss', 'suit', 'corporate', 'greed', 'was', 'high', 'agenda', '90s', 'wake', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Milken', 'era', 'Let', 'give', 'no-brainer', 'picking', 'character', 'backdrop.The', 'second', 'influence', 'less', 'obvious', 'television', 'forgotten', 'first', 'controversial', 'series', 'challenging', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'agendas', 'driven', 'sociopathology', 'PBS', 'Cladius', 'Somehow', 'everyone', 'dressed', 'robes', 'softened', 'blow', 'pure', 'agendas', 'cruelty', 'nearly', 'characters', 'first', 'episodes', 'incest', 'was', 'only', 'mildest', 'shocks', 'Anyone', 'who', 'Profit', 'certainly', 'did', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'can', 'comfort', 'purchasing', 'Claudius', 'series']",N/A

The title of the series is taken from the name of the main character, Jim Profit, but both the title and the name are a play on the famous biblical quote (also used in the movie Nixon) ""What profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul?""  And Jim Profit truly IS soulless, a ruthless psychopath who cares for no one but himself.  Yet there is a vulnerable side to him as well, only glimpsed at when he ends each show by going to sleep naked in a dirty cardboard box.Although eight episodes of Profit were created, Fox only aired four before giving it the ax--perhaps Jim Profit  passionately kissing his mother didn't go over well.  Whatever the reason, it  was a real shame to see this intelligent, well-written, and totally unique show taken off the air; without a doubt, this series was ahead of its time.  At least with this DVD release, more people will get a chance to see what they may have missed back then, and those of us who had become fast fans finally get to view the unaired episodes.

It was a show where you actually root for the bad guy...even though you know you shouldn't.  I was so upset when this show was cancelled after just a handful of episodes.  The debut is still to this day the singular best debut that I ever seen for a television show, and not many shows can boast the caliber of acting that Profit displayed.  Even with so few broadcasted episodes, this show made such an impression on me that it is to this day one of my top five favorite television shows ever.  I was so excited to see it become available on DVD.  I never thought it would since it didn't even last one half a season before the network yanked it.  It's so sad how networks yank truly great shows before they've even had a chance to build an audience.  I had thought Fox would have kept the show considering they kept The X-Files on even after less than stellar ratings the first couple years.  That show eventually became their flagship show because they allowed it to build it's audience over time.  Too bad they didn't allow Profit the same chance.  The X-Files is my all-time favorite show, but I have a feeling had Profit lasted, it would have usurped The X-Files in that number one spot.  Sadly, it was never given the chance to do that.Anyway, Profit was ahead of its time by about 8 years.  I think had the show debuted today it would be given a chance to prove itself.  Dark shows like Profit are much more common today then they were in the mid-ninties.  If you like shows with a dark premise that has great acting, then you are sure to like Profit.  The main character Profit is probably the darkest character, human or otherwise, that I have ever seen on television.  He's a total sociopath who will do whatever it takes to get ahead whether it be through manipulation, seduction, murder.  The audience, however, has seen via flashbacks the horrific childhood that Profit lead.  He suffered the worst kind of abuse possible by being locked up in a box like an animal and his only contact with the outside world being a small TV set...through which he learned everything.  Those flashbacks allow the audience to connect to the character and even in some cases root for him to succeed in his diabolical schemes.  Profit reminds me very much of Hannibal Lecter from the movie Silence of the Lambs.  They are both sociopathic geniuses who excel in manipulating people to their own ends.  The only differences being that Profit isn't a cannibal(at least not that we know of) and Profit hasn't been caught...yet.This was one of the most gripping shows I have ever seen.  And I am sure that had it lasted it would have swept the Emmys for best drama show and best actor.  However, we'll never know.  I'm just glad to see it out on DVD with some never-aired episodes to boot.

And, trust me, if you don't see the appeal in ""Profit""--you aren't invited to my party.""Profit"" is a show that was simply a few years ahead of its time.  The primary character is one of TV's suavest villains and the show was bold, merciless, ruthless and wickedly funny.  We weren't ready for an antihero--someone with no moral code other than greed and manipulation.  Many people have astutely referred to this show as something that might be made for the FX network today.  I think this is a fair statement--but many of those shows try so hard to be provocative, it's just something that felt more natural with ""Profit.""Adrian Pasdar is phenomenal as Jim Profit.  Psychologically damaged as a child, he sleeps naked in a cardboard box at night and ruthlessly attempts to take over a business empire by day.  His performance is deadly smooth, compelling, dangerous, but very very charming.  It's a tremendous performance in a fantastic role.  It's great to see Pasdar again in the current ""Heroes""--he has a unique presence.  But of course, any villain needs a partner in crime.  So here we get Lisa Blount as Profit's amoral stepmother.  And if the thought of a sexual liaison between a guy and his stepmother seems too racy, this might not be the program for you.Not everything in ""Profit"" is perfect.  Some of the computer virtual reality scenes are dated.  I'm not in love with every performance in the supporting cast--Lisa Zane, in particular, strikes a few false notes as the most incompetent head of security you're likely to see in the corporate world.

It plays like a corporate version of the series DEXTER without the deliberate weekly bodycount, but like that show you keep coming back to it because it's a bit like watching a disaster unfold and you can't take your eyes away from it.Profit is a well produced series that really deserved a longer run than it got, and one that even now is very watchable for the little that was made.

During a time when the network had countless ""edgy"" series attempting to be companions to the megahit X-Files (Space: Above & Beyond, Kindred: The Embraced, Strange Luck), Profit was never given the time it needed to grow before it got the axe, but thanks to a surprisingly loyal fan base and the good folks at Anchor Bay, this underrated show finally makes it's DVD debut.  Adrian Pasdar (from Near Dark and TV's Mysterious Ways where he plays a polar opposite miracle seeker, heh heh...) plays Jim Profit: a man who will do anything to climb his way up the corporate ladder.  Whether it be murder, kidnapping, extortion; nothing is out of reach for this man who is having an affair with his dope-raddled stepmother and sleeps naked in a box.  Is he just a Patrick Bateman-esque corporate sociopath, or is he the ultimate evil incarnate?  Sadly, many questions were never answered as Fox axed Profit not long after it's controversial premiere, but now it's here to be disected and indulged on DVD.

A little like the devil, he brings everyone down to rise to the top. Pasdar definitely performs the role as if being such a sick twist is normalcy. Fox pulled the show that would've brought a huge audience once discovered. The voice over of Profit on everyone picks at their various personal details and variable idiosyncracies.

As is all-too often the case, a network refused to stand behind a show and give it the necessary time to find an audience. Truth be told, I think Profit would be a much better fit on today's television landscape, where many cable outlets are able to survive - and thrive - with smaller audiences, such as those for programs like The 4400, Rescue Me and Nip/Tuck.Profit is a show you won't soon forget, with imagry that will burn itself into your mind. It is also a show that won't leave viewers with mixed emotions... they will either love or hate it, as was the case during its original run. Those who fall in warped, twisted love with the series will find themselves wanting to defend their show voraciously. Those who loath it will argue just as loudly.But honestly... when was the last time a network television show inspired such intense feelings - good or bad - in an audience?

In a later episode, there is a scene in a nursing home that has the quality of Hitchcock, but turned on its head: the hero committing parricide, a wheel chair scene (reminiscent of Pickup on South Street), and a kind of Houdini escape, and it works.The second and third episodes are also amazing. In the third, a great reversal occurs, w/Lisa Zane (what the hell happened to her career, she is great!), that could have fueled this show for a LONG time: in kicking up dust to cover his own tracks, Profit proves expert at uncovering people who are far worse than he.This show is a great meditation on evil, with most of it emanating from the good people.

In fact they lost money as revealed in the interveiw extras. I for one am glad this show did'nt go on to have a second and third season. The storyline as I understand it was originally written start to finish. The ending was a bit dissappointing as it was apparently changed in anticipation of further seasons. Had this happened money, not creativity would have become the driving force of the story. Best left as a mini series gem.

The series has some fine actors, notably in the lead, and playing Profit's stepmother and assistant.  However there are a number of factors that led this to be somewhat tedious viewing after a few episodes.  There is a marked datedness to the way it was shot -- overly bright, flat lighting in many scenes, poor costume design for many characters (particularly Nora), and the voiceover's generally smug nature can become tiresome.  The show took many chances, and for television this was somewhat new.  However not all groundbreaking series hold up well over the years as new ones expand on their innovations and viewers become accustomed to the changes.  The commentaries, while sometimes enlightening, also seemed rather too self-congratulatory and repetitive.

It gives me hope that other short-lived but equally deserving shows will make it too. It's not going to be to everyone's taste but I knew I was hooked the minute Jim Profit walked into his apartment and passionately kissed a blonde haired woman then pulled away and said, ""Hi Mom."" This show is daring and perverse and I loved it!! If you want to see something out of the ordinary with a wicked sense of humor then give Profit a try. You can't beat the price.Update - I think it worth adding that Showtime's amazing hit, Dexter, owes some nods to this series. Having a psychopath as the lead character was quite a shocker when this series was made and in the end may have led to it's early demise as audiences just weren't ready to accept such a concept.The setting is completely different as Profit is a corporate shark (ala American Psycho) where Dexter is a crime drama but the similarities are striking, right down to the character's internal monolog used as a voice-over. Though Dexter (despite the fact that he's an outright serial killer) is a bit more sympathetic than Profit who has no qualms about what he does to the innocent. Each are fascinating characters in their own right.So if you're a Dexter fan, you might want to give Jim Profit a try.",5,Delightfully Twisted Entertainment,1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,1339,"['Wow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'powers', 'be', 'have', 'put', 'twisted', 'little', 'gem', 'dvd', 'hope', 'other', 'short-lived', 'equally', 'deserving', 'shows', 'will', 'make', 'too', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'knew', 'was', 'hooked', 'minute', 'Jim', 'Profit', 'walked', 'apartment', 'passionately', 'kissed', 'blonde', 'haired', 'woman', 'then', 'pulled', 'away', 'said', 'Hi', 'Mom', 'show', 'daring', 'perverse', 'loved', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'ordinary', 'wicked', 'sense', 'humor', 'then', 'give', 'Profit', 'try', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'price.Update', 'think', 'worth', 'adding', 'Showtime', 'amazing', 'hit', 'Dexter', 'nods', 'series', 'Having', 'psychopath', 'lead', 'character', 'was', 'quite', 'shocker', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'end', 'may', 'have', 'led', 'early', 'demise', 'audiences', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'ready', 'accept', 'concept.The', 'setting', 'completely', 'different', 'Profit', 'corporate', 'shark', 'ala', 'American', 'Psycho', 'where', 'Dexter', 'crime', 'drama', 'similarities', 'are', 'striking', 'right', 'down', 'character', 'internal', 'monolog', 'used', 'voice-over', 'Dexter', 'fact', 'outright', 'serial', 'killer', 'bit', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'Profit', 'who', 'qualms', 'what', 'innocent', 'are', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'own', 'right.So', ""'re"", 'Dexter', 'fan', 'might', 'want', 'give', 'Jim', 'Profit', 'try']",N/A
