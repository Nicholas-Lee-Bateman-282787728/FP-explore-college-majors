I watched his moves and thought to myself how could he still move like that after all the years that had passed. Every thing he did in this was awesome. I, like so many others wish that we could have gotten a chance to see him perform just one more time. He was and will always be tbe greatest entertainer to ever live. All you have to do is look at this DVD. Once you get started you are not going to want to move until it is over. Love you forever, Mike.

Take the footage and edit it into what was MJ's vision and give us a concert, or #2.  Show the film as a progression of MJ's vision, how it started and how it progressed and show us a glimpse of what it ""couda been"".They chose the latter, at first I was bummed, wishing they wouda tried to make it as the concert that shouda been and give us a show or all shows, using the best of the dress rehearsals and using the newly filmed video footage in it's completion.  But the path they chose isnt bad either.They show us MJ the man and how he leads the rehearals, how he takes charges and knows what he wants and also shows how considerate he was to his cast of dancers and the band, no big ego coming off from him at all, but a perfedetionist wanting to get it right for the fans.There was a lot of film shot and they use alot to show the progression from the start to the ending where you can just tatse the upcoming concert and how awesome it was going to be.maybe they will go back into the film vaults and try to capture a complete concert as it was to be, no song breaks or talking on how to fix this or that but giving us a fel of a complete concert that never was, it can be done and it will blow your minds.Rest in Peace MJ",4,too much editing..but they chose that route,1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,1352,"['director', 'Kenny', 'Ortega', 'had', '100', 'hours', 'footage', 'work', 'with.They', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'two', 'paths', 'film', '1', 'Take', 'footage', 'edit', 'what', 'was', 'MJ', 'vision', 'give', 'concert', '2', 'Show', 'film', 'progression', 'MJ', 'vision', 'how', 'started', 'how', 'progressed', 'show', 'glimpse', 'what', 'couda', 'been', 'chose', 'latter', 'first', 'was', 'bummed', 'wishing', 'wouda', 'tried', 'make', 'concert', 'shouda', 'been', 'give', 'show', 'shows', 'using', 'best', 'dress', 'rehearsals', 'using', 'newly', 'filmed', 'video', 'footage', 'completion', 'path', 'chose', 'isnt', 'bad', 'either.They', 'show', 'MJ', 'man', 'how', 'rehearals', 'how', 'charges', 'what', 'also', 'how', 'considerate', 'was', 'cast', 'dancers', 'band', 'big', 'ego', 'coming', 'off', 'perfedetionist', 'wanting', 'get', 'right', 'fans.There', 'was', 'lot', 'film', 'shot', 'use', 'alot', 'show', 'progression', 'start', 'ending', 'where', 'can', 'just', 'tatse', 'upcoming', 'concert', 'how', 'awesome', 'was', 'going', 'be.maybe', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'film', 'vaults', 'try', 'capture', 'complete', 'concert', 'was', 'be', 'song', 'breaks', 'talking', 'how', 'fix', 'giving', 'fel', 'complete', 'concert', 'never', 'was', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'will', 'blow', 'minds.Rest', 'Peace', 'MJ']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

He was not a child molester, but he had issues accepting himself. Yes, he did not need to change the colour of his skin. This is what can sometimes happen in a very racist society, and it's sad when people internalize these things. I hope he's in a better place.

1284496,AGEIT17HENDIS,B002R0EIVI,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","I have done a fair number of musical reviews in this space from old country blues tunes to Cole Porter to Billy Holiday to Bob Dylan and so on. All either reflected my personal interests or represented a segment of, mainly, American cultural expression that I thought was important to take note of. Some groups and individuals like the Beatles, most, but not all, hip-hop, Joan Baez and others have gotten short shrift in this space not because they are not important components of the modern cultural scene but out of sheer personal preference. The late performer, Michael Jackson, with or without the Five, fit very comfortably in that niche for me. No longer though after viewing the film documentary, although performance is a better term, """"This Is It"", based on rehearsals for what was to be Michael Jackson's last world tour.I am not sure, and in any case it is not important to this review, whether the film footage here would have seen the light of day if Michael Jackson had not died in 2009. The core of the film is a series of rehearsals that Jackson and his cast of singers, dancers, and musicians went through in preparation for a ""This Is It"" last Jackson world tour that was planned to begin just after his untimely death. The concept, according to Jackson, was to give his fans one last extravagant chance to hear and see him perform his greatest hits.Now these kinds of world tours, last ones or not, are all in a day's work in the entertainment business. As are behind-the scenes ""reality"" looks at how certain cultural events are put to together. What make this film extraordinary are the fire, the imagination, and the sheer stage presence that Michael Jackson brought to the whole enterprise.Did you read that right? This reviewer, who has spend the last forty or some years happily ignoring Michael Jackson, his music, his dancing, his off-stage antics, and his legal difficulties  was totally transfixed, totally riveted by Jackson's work here. In rehearsal, of all places. Christ, as the headline indicates, he is probably one of few men who have ever lived who did not turn into a cartoonish character while wearing orange pants during some of his numbers. Although this film also demonstrates the very deferential way in which those who worked with him treated him, which may be a key to some of his off-stage problems going back to his childhood days, and I am positive I would not want to work with him this man, as singer, dancer and stage personality comes through. This kind of personality does not pass through this earth all that often. Watch what you missed.

For a reason I can't be 100% sure of it was Michael Jackson who indirectly started my own personal interest in music and especially the performance of it. That's one of the view things I can say I really do have in common with most of my generation and I'm very proud of that. So what does this show us?What's it's meaning"" Well Mike was about to do a comeback tour where he'd perform some of his best known tunes. This movie really does offer you a backstage pass to a group of happy and enthusiastic dancers and musicians all gearing up to work with their inspiration himself. As it turns out Michael Jackson is both a perfectionist and someone who understands the performers he's working with. His between rehersal chatting with these people is alternately constructive,humble and also easy going. He takes on the possition of a teacher/father figure to this band of dancers and players he later calls ""a family"". Along the way you get a look into the elaborate, modern multi media concepts he had for the show. On the final rehersals we find some the best live replications of his studio triumphs I've ever heard. Mike's respectful attitude really baught out the best in everyone involved and it would've been quite a show had it happened. The truth is it was also plainly obvious as,even while he was still outdoing some of the performers with his boundless energy there's a hint of resignation and sadness. Mike chose the songs in this performance for more than nostalgia;they all say something about his outlook on life. And he strongly emphasizes messages songs like ""Man In The Mirror"" and ""Earth Song"" which,while melodramatic are genuinely heartfelt pleas from Mike to actually feel empathy for others. And to those who think of this as gooey schmaltz......well Mike really meant the message in his music and his dialog brings that out. I was left with a strange mixture of delight and regret after watching this because I now firmly believe,with Michael Jackson not with us anymore in a musical context that a part of us are missing out on something we all need more of.

Its a good thing I didn't see this in theatres because everytime Michael Jackson starts singing I will be singing and dancing in my seat. This movie basically consist of Michael Jackson and his crew preparing for his new kick*** tour This Is It. Its very interesting seeing how michael works. You can tell hes a true musical genious. He knows exactly how he wants to go about things and how he wants his music played. To add icing to the cake this movie consist of just about every fan favorite including his newest song This Is It (I have the album too). I absolutely loved the new videos they made for Earth song and Thriller. I also love seeing the visuals the planned to have throughout the show. I do wish You Rock My World, Will You Be There, and Don't stop till you get enough were part of the concert. My favorite Mike song is Human Nature.One thing about Mike that makes him such a great entertainer is that he does 100% more than any artist I've ever seen in my 18 years. He doesn't just sing and dance on stage in front of a microphone, but he always puts on a puts on a show. You don't know what to expect while in other concerts like Beatles or rap concerts its just peaple singing on stage rarely moving around (Sorry Beatles fans I'm just not into them like that). You couldn't really blame Michael for not moving the way he used to he isn't as young as he was after all.I heard that before his death peaple had lined up and bought tickets ahead of time. I don't blame them because this would have probably been the greatest concert in history sinse I think his Dangerous tour which happened before I was born. Its sad that this will never be.

1284510,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B002R0EIVI,Armando N. Roman,"[3, 3]","Here it is, the sequel to the greatest movie of all time (Thriller). Ok, not quite, but This Is It deserves all of these 5 star reviews. I'm not one to just hand out 5 stars for anything, especially movies, but after my first viewing of This Is It, I was impressed. Not only is this an excellent concert performance, but it offers a look at just how much of a perfectionist Michael was, and shows that the man really did know his stuff when it came to music. He wasn't a performer who let everyone do their thing while he did his couple of tasks. No, Michael took part in every single aspect of the show. Music, lighting, effects, visuals, costumes, the guy made sure everything was perfect, and you have to admire that. Had he lived to do the performances he was rehearsing for on this disc, I think it very well could've been the greatest tour ever. All those people who flew across the world just to get tickets, and those who payed an ungodly amount for them...they definitely would've gotten their money's worth.This Is It, in case you still didn't know, is almost an entire concert performance. It's rehearsals for what would've supposedly been Michael's final tour, and he was pulling out all the stops to make it the ultimate concert. It starts out with the main dancers being selected, out of hundreds, and we get to see how happy each and every person is to even have a chance to dance with the master himself. Each person that gets screen time to talk about how important MJ was to them is genuine, and you can't help but feel happy for these kids when they get selected. After that, it quickly gets into the main show, and you're treated to almost all of Michael's biggest hits. While the performances recorded aren't finished, since it's just rehearsals, they included a lot of the visuals that would've been shown on the big screen behind everyone, and work the lighting as well. Not every song goes through without interruption- there are times when Michael stops or re-does certain parts because he felt it could've been better, or if a light didn't go off at the right moment. I can't stress it enough- the guy wanted everything to be perfect for this show. There are also some semi-backstage bits where Michael works with the band and lets them know what the exact tone and rhythm is that he wants for x song at x point in time. You can tell when he gets frustrated, but MJ manages to keep his cool most of the time.My only complaint is one that's pretty small, and something I understand, and it's that Michael doesn't perform much while singing, as far as his facial expressions and arm movements go. Watch his videos for Beat It, Bad and a few other classics, and then see him perform the songs here and you'll see what I mean. Regardless, I enjoyed every minute of this show. The little movie he made for Smooth Criminal was great, and I think I would've lost it if I were in attendance, had the show went on. What impressed me the most was the plan for Thriller, and how zombies would've been flying over the audience. How could you NOT want to be there for something like that? I know this review seems one-sided with how much praise I'm giving it, but this really is an excellent documentary/concert, and it deserves the high ratings it has. They never make this a MJ tribute, and focus on his death. In fact, they don't touch on it at all except a tiny bit at the end. I'm glad they did that.Visually, it doesn't get much better. The show is presented in 1080p and looks spectacular. Even with 'just' footage from rehearsals, everything looks amazing, and it makes you wonder why more backstage footage doesn't look this good. The audio is a treat for the ears too- presented in 5.1 DTS-HD MA. There are subtitles in English and French, but 75% of this is songs that everyone getting it should know by now, even if they don't speak the same language.The special features are minimal, but still great. The extras for both the blu-ray and dvd include 2 documentaries and 3 featurettes. One for finding the dancers, one- Memories of Michael that's pretty touching, and then another for the costumes used in the show. The blu-ray gets some exclusive extras though: Thriller and Smooth Criminal vignettes, the making of the Smooth Criminal vignette, and then the blu-ray live fare. I don't know if Kenny Ortega is one of those directors who chooses to let the film speak for itself, but I would've liked it if he had done a commentary track with stories from the set. But as it is, I'm happy with what's here.Every Michael Jackson fan should see this at least once in their life. I bought it without seeing it prior, and it was a good choice. While not every one of his biggest hits is performed on here, you're still getting a lot of them. And to see MJ dance just as good as he did when he was younger, that's worth admission on its own right there. The man was amazing, and seeing how he is on here when talking to his dancers, stagehands, band members, and everyone else, you get the feeling that he could never hurt anyone, and wasn't bitter even after the media messes he was in. So don't be a smooth criminal, just buy This Is It today.",5,"Yeah, it deserves all these 5 star reviews.",1273622400,"05 12, 2010",2010,5164,"['Here', 'sequel', 'greatest', 'movie', 'time',

1284512,A2WFNZWC8O6O1J,B002R0EIVI,Atticus,"[2, 3]","This movie is a monument to two things: one of the greatest entertainers in the music world, and what would have been one of the greatest concerts of all time.  Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson died before his dream ""final curtain call"" tour could become a reality.  But the concert director Kenny Ortega has pieced together 2 hours worth (from over 100 hours of rehearsal footage) of song, dance, interviews, and on-stage video from the concert.  The result is absolutely stunning.  In this movie you have two hours of pure entertainment.  You will want to sing and dance along with Jackson and his crew as they rehearse for an awe-inspiring curtain.  And how awe-inspiring it is!  Some of the highlights: Jackson cut into scenes from GILDA and other film noir classics leading into the toe-tapping SMOOTH CRIMINAL.  An on-stage ""toaster"" that pops dancers out from under floor boards.  A ""cherry-picker"" that lifts MJ out over the audience during the rockin' BEAT IT.  What about a new, goulish THRILLER?  All of these songs are familiar and appealing.  We love hearing them, and watching MJ rehearse them is a delight.  There are old favorites (all of the afore mentioned pieces) and some new ones I hadn't heard before (I JUST CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU, and a gut-wrenching EARTH SONG).  You want to get up and dance with him and his amazing crew.  However, in the back of your mind, you know that it was never to be.  MJ met his tragic end before he could see his dream concert through to reality.  In the rehearsal footage, he looks so healthy and energetic.  It's hard to look at him up on the stage, so intoxicated with the infectious music, with the knowledge that, in two months time, he will be dead.  The world will always mourn the loss of a talented star.  However, we will always have THIS IS IT, his labor of love.  Whatever demons haunted MJ behind the curtain, on-stage he was and always will be The King of Pop.  THIS IS IT shows us that.

I just returned from the Premiere and I can't wait to go back to the theater tomorrow to experience the magic again.As this movie is from the footage of rehearsals for his 50 concert performances in London, Michael Jackson was extraordinarily ""hands on"" regarding every facet of the concert ""experience"" he was creating.What I paid special attention to was Michael's appearance as far as health is concerned. I can ASSURE you this Gift to Humanity named Michael Jackson was at PEAK performance. He looked radiant, happy, he had a huge amount of energy, he was clearly in love with the process of creating something to make this world a better place - and he said so during rehearsals.With such super high energy that went into the rehearsals, I think just about anyone would have difficulty winding down to go to sleep. It is my pure opinion that Michael accidentally too more medicine to help him sleep, without realizing it was too much.The energy Michael and ALL who were involved in these rehearsals exuded that ""It"" quality - the kind that is almost indefinable in words - that transports you with awe INTO the experience.The movie Director, producers, special effects, make-up, costume, musicians, the dancers who performed with Michael during these final rehearsals before his passing are all PHENOMENAL.I feel we owe a HUGE debt of gratitude to the special souls who actually took the footage during the rehearsals.

Were they intending to release this before he died, or was this footage meant until then for internal consumption only?I admit it's an interesting, though sanitized, look at what goes on behind the scenes during the preparation for a show like this.But what disappointed me was that Michael's voice was shot.  His dancing was also lackluster.  Even the most unremarkable of his back-up stage dancers, could have totally killed him.  The guy was about 50 when this was shot, and this film makes it obvious he shouldn't have been singing and dancing that way anymore (noticeable and repeated breakings of his voice).Plus, the choreography for the songs themselves was a major let-down, with a couple of exceptions (e.g., ""Thriller"").

1284529,AQKKQ6L7Q9YJS,B002R0EIVI,ChaCha,"[3, 5]","It seems that Michael Jackson has been with me for my entire life.  I fondly remember him as a child sensation as part of the Jackson Five then quickly turning into a pre-teen idol who shortly after eclipsed his brothers with a string of solo hits like ""Rockin Robin"" and ""Got To Be There"".  We were still aware of Michael in his later teen years as he escorted Tatum O'Neil to award shows but at this point in his life, more famous for his celebrity, not his work.  Enter, the album ""Off The Wall, featuring a newly coiffed and buffed Michael which generated some memorable hits.  He was just coming into his own as a young adult, so perfect for the newly evolving music video format.  Luckily, he defeated the odds of becoming a has-been which was territory he could have easily descended into.Shortly thereafter, came Thriller, the record breaking album, the phenomenal videos and the famous ""moonwalk"" dance that was premiered on the Motown TV special.  How did he do that?  How does a human being move like that?  How does any artist get to have every song from an album a hit?  How can one person be THAT talented?  Sadly, after the Thriller years, Michael became the face of ""weird"", easy tabloid fodder for many, many years to come until the time of his death (and surely for many years to follow - expect convenience store sightings soon).  Wanting to purchase the remains of the Elephant Man, marriage to Elvis' daughter, the plastic surgeries, the child molestation accusations, the mystery surrounding the birth of his children, the dangling of infant Blanket over the rail of a balcony, the infamous Martin Bashir interview, all but a few of the headlines we the public sampled over the years.  There was all this drama but no more real music.  It was hard to remember Michael the performer and not Michael, the owner of Bubbles the Chimp.I thought his career was so over.  Too much bad publicity. Too many excesses. It was just too late.  What evidence was there that he was still relevent? To quote sister Janet's 90's hit, ""What Have You Done for Me Lately?"".I honestly didn't want to see this film.  I went as a favor to my sister.  Being tired, I thought a little shut eye would get me through this film if it became unbearable.  The first 10 minutes, I got what I expected, some dull dancer interviews ""Oh my god, it's a life long dream to work with Michael"", ""He inspired me"" etc...dull, snooze, snooze.  Well I love being proved wrong; captivated I was. The man could still sing, he could still dance and still ""wow"" me.  Contrary to the snooze fest I was expecting, this was riveting.  I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen.  In addtion to the performing, there was a very human Michael who starred as being Michael the person, not the drug crazed, nose falling off freak that we read about. He seemed healthy, he had a good sense of humor was charming and very much in sync with the business of his production.  He won me back as a fan and I've no doubt that if not for his untimely death, this concert would have put him back on the map.  He still had it and then some.It got a little tiresome at the end but despite that, I would have given it a 10 star rating if I could.  Michael, you will be missed.  You still had it.",5,"If You Need a Reminder of Jackson's Talent, THIS IS IT",1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,3247,"['Michael', 'Jackson', 'been', 'entire', 'life', 'fondly', 'remember', 'child', 'sensation', 'part', 'Jackson', 'Five', 'then', 'quickly', 'turning', 'pre-teen', 'idol', 'who', 'shortly', 'eclipsed', 'brothers', 'string', 'solo', 'hits', 'Rockin', 'Robin', 'Got', 'Be', 'were', 'still', 'aware', 'Michael', 'later', 'teen', 'years', 'escorted', 'Tatum', ""O'Neil"", 'award', 'shows', 'point', 'life', 'more', 'famous', 'celebrity', 'not', 'work', 'Enter', 'album', 'Wall', 'featuring', 'newly', 'coiffed', 'buffed', 'Michael', 'generated', 'memorable', 'hits', 'was', 'just', 'coming', 'own', 'young', 'adult', 'so', 'perfect', 'newly', 'evolving', 'music', 'video', 'format', 'Luckily', 'defeated', 'odds', 'becoming', 'has-been', 'was', 'territory', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'descended', 'into.Shortly', 'thereafter', 'came', 'Thriller', 'record', 'breaking', 'album', 'phenomenal', 'videos', 'famous', 'moonwalk', 'dance', 'was', 'premiered', 'Motown', 'TV', 'special', 'How', 'did', 'do', 'How', 'human', 'being', 'move', 'How', 'artist', 'get', 'have', 'song', 'album', 'hit', 'How', 'can', 'one', 'person', 'be', 'talented', 'Sadly', 'Thriller', 'years', 'Michael', 'became', 'face', 'weird', 'easy', 'tabloid', 'fodder', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'come', 'time', 'death', 'surely', 'many', 'years', 'follow', 'expect', 'convenience', 'store', 'sightings', 'soon', 'Wanting', 'purchase', 'remains', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'marriage', 'Elvis', 'daughter', 'plastic', 'surgeries', 'child', 'molestation', 'accusations', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'birth', 'children', 'dangling', 'infant', 'Blanket', 'rail', 'balcony', 'infamous', 'Martin', 'Bashir', 'interview', 'few', 'headlines', 'public', 'sampled', 'years', 'was', 'drama', 'more', 'real', 'music', 'was', 'hard', 'remember', 'Michael', 'performer', 'not', 'Michael', 'owner', 'Bubbles', 'Chimp.I', 'thought', 'career', 'was', 'so', 'Too', 'much', 'bad', 'publicity', 'Too', 'many', 'excesses', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'late', 'What', 'evidence', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'still', 'relevent', 'quote', 'sister', 'Janet', '90', 'hit', 'What', 'Have', 'Done', 'Me', 'Lately', '.I', 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'film', 'went', 'favor', 'sister', 'Being', 'tired', 'thought', 'little', 'shut', 'eye', 'would', 'get', 'film', 'became', 'unbearable', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'got', 'what', 'expected', 'dull', 'dancer', 'interviews', 'Oh', 'god', 'life', 'long', 'dream', 'work', 'Michael', 'inspired', 'etc', 'dull', 'snooze', 'snooze', 'Well', 'love', 'being', 'proved', 'wrong', 'captivated', 'was', 'man', 'could', 'still', 'sing', 'could', 'still', 'dance', 'still', 'wow', 'Contrary', 'snooze', 'fest', 'was', 'expecting', 'was', 'riveting', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'eyes', 'screen', 'addtion', 'performing', 'was', 'very', 'human', 'Michael', 'who', 'starred', 'being', 'Michael', 'person', 'not', 'drug', 'crazed', 'nose', 'falling', 'off', 'freak', 'read', 'seemed', 'healthy', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'was', 'charming', 'very', 'much', 'sync', 'business', 'production', 'won', 'back', 'fan', ""'ve"", 'doubt', 'not', 'untimely', 'death', 'concert', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'back', 'map', 'still', 'had', 'then', 'some.It', 'got', 'little', 'tiresome', 'end', 'would', 'have', 'given', '10', 'star', 'rating', 'could', 'Michael', 'will', 'be', 'missed', 'still', 'had']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

And to put this into perspective, when I was a little tike, I grew up with the Jackson Five and idolized MJ myself but I knew others that were popular as well.  The Yellow Submarine, Come On Baby Light My Fire, Bridge Over Troubled Water, It's a Family Affair come to mind along with Ben, ABC, Give Me One More Chance etc (Not necessarily the actual titles but what come to my mind when I think back on those days.Maybe because it was music that was popular with older brothers and sisters or parents but my son again, is crazy about MJ and MJ only!  So we pick up this DVD at the local movie rental and my son is in his favorite place, watching and listening to MJ perform and low and behold, I'm feeling like I did when I watched him perform as a child myself!Michael Jackson indeed was a talent the likes of which, the world hasn't ever seen and will not see again.  But this also shows you his technical side or better put, his ""Perfectionist"" side.  Something I didn't realize was how involved he was in every aspect of his performances from the dance moves, to singing, to how the music was played and his influence on making it ""JUST RIGHT"" for the benefit of his fans.We rented this but I am adding it to my list of things to buy.  It's a keeper!  Not only for my three year old but for everyone in this home that loves Michael Jackson and that's all of us.  In my opinion anyone that is a true MJ fan who hasn't viewed this, is doing themselves a great disservice.  This certainly is it!A fitting capture of the legends last performances even if he was just practicing and which displays how remarkably talented he truly was!  (Practice for Michael was like a boxer in a way, he would leave it all in the ring or on the punching bag so to speak meaning, when he practiced, it was like he was performing for the entire world.

1284531,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002R0EIVI,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 8]","""Michael Jackson's This Is It"" is a bittersweet experience. How can it not be? It's safe to say that the footage it contains is the last to show Michael Jackson alive. No, not merely alive - he practically surges with energy as he dances on stage in ways we've come to expect (save for the Moonwalk, shown ever so briefly at a disappointingly odd angle). We see not the frail fifty-year-old beaten down by years of legal battles, molestation allegations, financial woes, and drug abuse, but a seemingly tireless entertainer flawlessly keeping up with his much younger background dancers. Could he have been counteracting his nightly propofol injections with a daily dose of uppers? It's a reasonable possibility. Propofol is not meant to be used as a sleeping aid, but as the first stage of general anesthesia and only under the supervision of trained physicians.Be that as it may, this film reveals that Jackson was still capable of putting on a good show even weeks before his death. Compiled from hours of footage shot during the rehearsals of his comeback concert tour, ""This Is It"" is astounding entertainment, assembled under the supervision of Kenny Ortega to play more or less as a real concert would have played. The only exceptions are the moments of backstage conversing, in which Jackson, Ortega, and numerous dancers and musicians discuss the direction of the show and ways in which to improve it. When a mistake is made, no one reacts badly; Jackson in particular shows remarkable compassion by saying, ""This is why we have rehearsals."" His fellow performers listen attentively, not only because they want to put on the best possible show for concertgoers, but also because ... well, because they're working with Michael Jackson.Indeed, there is something powerful, if a little dramatic, about how devoted the background dancers are to the King of Pop. Just after the opening titles, we see footage of young men and women gushing over him, thanking him from the bottoms of their hearts for giving them this opportunity. Some are reduced to tears. Would they react this way in the presence of any other singer? More to the point, has any other singer instilled such deep feelings within his or her fan base? You watch them completely transfixed, and while you may not share their point of view, you almost certainly will feel the adoration coming off the screen.The same can be said for the intensity of the concert footage. Every song is carefully orchestrated and masterfully combined with mesmerizing dance sequences. ""They Don't Care About Us"" combines live dancers with a screen full of futuristic soldiers moving to the rhythms (this effect was achieved by means of motion-capture technology). ""Thriller"" and ""Smooth Criminal"" are accompanied by elaborate filmed sequences; the former features a newly shot graveyard sequence while the latter features Jackson digitally combined with screen idols like Rita Hayworth and Humphrey Bogart. ""Black or White"" ends with a fantastic electric guitar duel that will have you applauding. ""Human Nature"" and ""Billie Jean"" rely less on special effects and more on Jackson's dancing abilities; this isn't as visually stunning, but it certainly feels more personal.Where on earth did Jackson find the energy for this? Watching him in ""This Is It,"" you almost forget that he ended up dying of cardiac arrest brought on by a drug overdose. You also almost forget that the overdose was brought on by years of addiction; when you have to rely on potentially lethal medications like propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam for something as ordinary as sleep, it stands to reason that one would not be functional the next day, or any other day. And yet there's Jackson, up on stage moving his body with the speed and agility of a man half his age. Right up to the end, he still had it. But one wonders: Would he have been able to maintain that level of energy if he had lived to start his concert tour?""This is my final curtain call,"" Jackson said when announcing his comeback tour at London's O2 arena back in March. ""This is it."" These words sounded ominous even then. I don't claim to be a diehard Michael Jackson fan, but all the same, I think it would have been interesting to see him try rebuilding his career. What other albums would have been released? Could there have been something even more successful than ""Thriller,"" which won eight Grammys and is currently the best-selling album of all time? What songs would we have heard on them? Would any of them be played on the radio? Even though we'll never hear anything new from the King of Pop, we can at least be grateful for the music he left us with. We can also be grateful for ""Michael Jackson's This Is It,"" which is not only a fine example of music, choreography, and staging, but is also one of the most entertaining documentaries I've ever seen.",5,The King of Pop Bids Farewell,1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,4857,"['Michael', 'Jackson', 'bittersweet', 'experience', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'safe', 'say', 'footage', 'last', 'show',

Its really great for his fans to see him enjoying singing, enjoying what he is doing, and in a personal stuff, he seems like a real angel.. and since now, he is that for me, an angel and my closest friend.I have watched this movie 10 times, and i cant wait for my DVD, i think here in Colombia the movie is not be longer presented, i am very sad about that.I think, any Michael Jackson' fan will enjoy this more than enything else in the world.Michael Jackson, for me, is one of the greatest gifts from God, that we never have been able to deserve.",5,Unbelievable experince.,1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,1315,"['Well', 'i', 'have', 'always', 'admired', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'music', 'energy', 'originality', 'genious..', 'never', 'felt', 'close..', 'When', 'i', 'knew', 'film', 'i', 'didnt', 'know', 'what', 'hope', 'i', 'knew', 'i', 'had', 'watch', 'it.Now', 'i', 'saw', 'film', 'what', 'most', 'close', 'experience', 'meet', 'concert', 'understand', 'what', 'Michael', 'magic', 'way', 'people', 'felt', 'extraordinary.Now', 'i', 'feel', 'i', 'love', 'i', 'admire', 'i', 'cant', 'stop', 'listening', 'music', 'watching', 'videos', 'youtube', 'everything', 'i', 'can', 'i', 'cant', 'just', 'get', 'tired', 'man', 'actually', 'changed', 'life.The', 'inspiration', 'there', 'see', 'amazing', 'talented', 'person', 'are', 'happy', 'gift', 'then', 'realized', 'gone', 'what', 'huge', 'lost', 'really', 'great', 'fans', 'see', 'enjoying', 'singing', 'enjoying', 'what', 'doing', 'personal', 'stuff', 'real', 'angel..', 'now', 'angel', 'closest', 'friend.I', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', '10', 'times', 'i', 'cant', 'wait', 'DVD', 'i', 'think', 'here', 'Colombia', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'longer', 'presented', 'i', 'am', 'very', 'sad', 'that.I', 'think', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'fan', 'will', 'enjoy', 'more', 'enything', 'else', 'world.Michael', 'Jackson', 'one', 'greatest', 'gifts', 'God', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'deserve']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

And when he wears Manchurian shoulder pads for his duet, he looks like an Undead from World of Warcraft waving at Judith Hill, his body language and chemistry obviously do not correspond to the lyrics ""I just can't stop loving you."" It would take a lot of devastating changes to his face to remove the inherent charm of Michael Jackson hence crazy ghost face.  But just listening to This is It and then turning around to sneak a look at his limbs, his shoulders moving, his flat waist and I get why minstrels becames stars at royal courts, how they could seduce kings and queens and become rich on their magnetism and hypnotic persuasive storytelling ability.  Michael in his original form would never ever convince anyone that it isn't wonderful to be African. I really miss all the songs from before the Japanese owned playlist.

1284536,AWBMGLP57SAGK,B002R0EIVI,"Cobe ""Cobe""","[3, 4]","I grew up listening to classical music and also playing classical music. Though I have also always liked pop music very much, I never imagined there would come a time when I would reach the point of literally *falling in love* with a pop artist. Never,... until I saw a Michael Jackson video (Dangerous) for the first time. I was in awe. That was about twenty years ago but his limitless talent and his unique charisma, his jaw-dropping performances, his admirable singing abilities were more than I would have ever expected from ANY performer. For different reasons, I never had the chance to see MJ live, but I had the hope that there would come a day when I would be one of the lucky ones standing in the audience at one of MJ's live concerts somewhere in the world. I had been hoping for Michael to return to the stage and, once more, awe the world with his rare talent. It could not happen. More than a year has passed since Michael's passing but I have not been able to come to terms with his death. He was too special.  I am so glad and so thankful to have been able to have this great video. As soon as ""This is it"" became available I got it on DVD. Just recently I also got another copy on blu-ray and I am thinking of getting a third one, just in case. Had Michael had the chance to go on his ""This is it"" tour, it would have been a wonderful show. It didn't happen, and this saddens me deeply. Michael was a very special human being and, as an artist, had a talent like no other. He was the best pop artist that ever lived, he is and will *always* be the best. This video comes to prove that, at almost 50 years of age, Michael was ready, once again, to charm and inspire the whole world. I will never find the words to describe my admiration for this phenomenal artist, for this special man.

1284538,A2BTRINPAMH9VJ,B002R0EIVI,Cookie,"[20, 65]","This movie was definitely more hype than substance. The concert would've been awesome. The rehearsal was not.While it's always interesting to watch Michael's rehearsals, we are watching this as a substitute for the real thing and it's terribly unsatisfying. The producers had touted this as a documentary but it isn't really. If this was a documentary, it lacked a narrative, point, or direction - essentially, what makes a documentary a documentary. It was just a mishmash of scenes slapped together. There was no flow between one scene to the next either and it all comes off as terribly disjointed. What might be called the 'documentary' part consists of a few instructions from Michael to the musicians and dancers, but apart from that, it was mostly about Michael performing on stage. And because this was a rehearsal, he wasn't performing full out. (Even so, his voice was pretty darn good.) But clearly this wasn't meant to be a concert film either, so it's neither here nor there.I can't imagine that Michael would have been happy with the release of this film. If you're a fan, you would know that Michael would NEVER let anyone see him at anything less than perfect. Not excellent - perfect. And certainly half-measures need not apply.This is just another act of blatant exploitation by AEG and Sony to make money off Michael. AEG had already recovered their costs more than twice over from the sale of the footage for $60m, and then they get the first $135m from the film (why?) before Michael's estate would even see a penny. If that's not obscene, I don't know what is.If this movie had been made as a proper documentary (a fleshier, step-by-step 'making of' film), it might've been more acceptable, but this was presented as a pseudo-concert. I'm sure they did the best with what they had, but this did not do justice to Michael nor his fans. One song, the most beautiful song - Speechless - was incomplete (what a travesty!), and many songs from the original setlist were not included (Rock With You, Dangerous, Dirty Diana, Heal the World, We Are The World, and many more). The concert was supposed to be 2.5 hours - you do the math. Some fans from This Is NOT It (who watched the actual rehearsals) said that Michael was weak and flubbing his lines. I wonder if that was the reason those songs were edited out.The movie tried to show what might have been, and yes, we're sad because we'll never get to see the real thing, but more than showing Mike's genius, this film revealed how unprepared AEG really was. Two weeks before the concert, major set pieces were still missing (they had to be created in CGI on the film), none of the dancers had their costumes and the backup singer and guitarist still didn't know their places on stage or how to move or when to play. Michael already knew all his songs and dance routines (I'm sure he could do them in his sleep) but the others didn't, and he had to instruct them step-by-step because these were not the singers and bandmates of old. It was a whole new cast and they had to learn how to perform with Michael. Many times, Michael had to slow down and wait for them to learn up, or notice that something was wrong but just bite his tongue. I'm not saying that those people are incompetent, I'm saying that they were all so hopelessly behind schedule! Michael had not even seen his costumes yet, much less rehearsed in them.This is all we'll see of what would never be, but I wonder if it would never have been anyway because the whole production was still so un-ready, a mere two weeks before opening night. Michael would not have wanted anything less than perfect. Is that why he looked so stressed, tired and unhappy and had lost so much weight towards the end (in Human Nature)?I don't want to sound ungrateful because this is a last look at the biggest genius of our time, and yet, after seeing this, I wish I hadn't because I would rather remember Michael in happier times, and Michael would not have wanted people to remember him giving anything less than 110%.To think that people are making boatloads of money hawking something that Michael would never have approved of is rather unpalatable. If you don't care about all that, the movie itself is actually just rather mediocre.

""SpecialDara""","[2, 2]","I have nothing, but praise for this incredible footage of the man who is a pure musical genius on stage, and sadly a misunderstood enigma offstage. I have been a fan of Michael Jackson all my life, from the age of three to an adult now. I never doubted him because I know his heart and I know his spirit. I didn't need to know him personally. His music told me who he was. He was a beautiful person, inside and out. I was not going to be one to judge about his appearance, when I didn't walk in his shoes. As watch this footage, I see what a hardworker, perfectionist and genius he was. He was more than just the greatest entertainer of the world. He was a humanitarian, that no one, not even the negative media, praise him for. The press coverage was about his personal life, his appearance and controveries.The tragedy of his untimely death has made me realize how short life is. To me, most people told him for granted when he was alive and some still do now that he's gone. I hope Michael is finally at peace. I will miss him, but his legacy was always live from the heart of his fans. Rest In Peace to the King of Pop.

The truth of the matter is I consider myself a dedicated fan of classical music and doubted that there would be anything in this movie that would get me interested.Boy was I wrong!""This is It"" is a truly remarkable account of a dedicated professional performer who knew his art to perfection; although I was unfamiliar with his music, his professional competence in what he was doing shows through very clearly. I found myself becoming enthusiastic about his vision for the production and certainly admired his control of the various forces that would be required to bring it to fruition.Another big plus was the level of professionalism demonstrated by those people he had gathered around him to fulfill this vision. It is indeed tragic that the only result of all of the huge effort put in by all of them was a single movie. It is true that some of the artists featured have used this as a springboard for their own careers, Jackson's lead guitarist; Orianthi Panagaris immediately comes to mind for example. It is hoped that others may also benefit from the gigantic effort that was put into the preparations for the stage presentations.I can recommend this film not only for Michael Jackson fans, but for anyone who has a sincere regard for professionalism, especially in the field of performance.

1284552,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B002R0EIVI,Deborah Earle,"[1, 1]","With a warm, beautiful smile, and a benevolent spirit, Director Kenny Ortega shares with us the dynamic footage of rehearsals for Michael Jackson's last concert, which was intended for Jackson's eyes only, but has now, like the life of Jackson himself, become a gift to the world, and especially to his children, with whom he had hoped to share his final performances.Amid the footage of auditioning dancers expressing delight at being able to work with Michael, and technichians demonstrating their craft, we see the King of Pop in full creative process, revamping his old numbers with gentle perfectionism and humour,leading his chosen troupe members in spirited dance moves.As a Generation Xer around for his entire career, my thoughts have flown back over the innumerable images of Michael Jackson that I've seen onscreen and in print on and off over the years since his passing. When he was at the height of his fame in the 80s, I was going through a passionately retro phase in my tastes in music, declining to behave like a card-carrying member of the MTV Generation, but I knew what Michael was up to, as did anyone who paid attention to entertainment news.We are led through performances of ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"", ""Jam"", and ""Bad"", during which we view notable details of the stage interpretations, as a counterpoint to the iconic videos of the '80s and '90s. Original music for the concert was produced by Michael Bearden.Other numbers include ""They Don't Care About Us"", which within days, would become a rallying song for election fraud protesters in Iran, but which here is performed with a digitalized army, followed by a performance of ""Human Nature"".A film noir feature of ""Smooth Criminal"",in which Michael is shown responding to clips featuring Rita Hayworth and Humphrey Bogart, as well as a scene of the original 1988 short film version follows.M.J. makes a spectacular exit in that number.He struts with Mekia Cox during, ""The Way You Make Me Feel"", and revisits the dance moves in an urban setting that were a part of the video of this 1987 release.There are a few slip-ups, but as he noted, ""That's why we rehearse.""Then we are entertained by the numbers from the days of the Jackson 5, some of which Michael and his back-up performers sing in a different key from the originals. That medley includes, ""I Want You Back"", ""The Love You Save"", ""I'll Be There"", and a very energetically performed, ""Shake Your Body Down to the Ground"".Judith Hill joins him for ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"".The recreation of ""Thriller"" was thrilling indeed, and it really would have been  something to see Michael emerge from that giant tarantula during that number. The dancing ghouls really hit the mark. The applause of the audience at the end of that number would have been deafening had the concert series come to fruition!In creating the costumes, and designing the sets, viewers receive an education about how associations with aerialsts (including acrobat Dreya Weber), jewelers, and a few scientists to create special effects in both the costumes and the sets.""Beat It!"" also evokes memories of the original video from the 80s, but with choreography last seen in Jackson's 2001 CBS Special.The Greek-Australian guitarist, Orianthi has her moment to shine during the rehearsal for the song, ""Black or White"",and she does so alongside fellow guitarist, Tommy Organ.Little Jasmine Alveran has a dramatic role to play during the rehearsal for ""Earth Song"", followed by the commentary about the state of the planet by the founder of the Heal the World Foundation--rather solemn musings by the man who held the Guinness World Record as the Most Humanitarian Entertainer for the last nine years of his life.""Billie Jean"" still has the same verve as it did in the 80s, although frankly, I was never much for the crotch grab that he claimed was a subliminal gesture.Although slight and frail looking, Jackson certainly didn't move like a man of 50.""Man in the Mirror"" is the last number performed onstage. The rehearsal ends on a favorable note.Within hours of that final rehearsal, eternal life greeted Michael as he was making other plans, much to the dismay of the world for which he did so much.But the final triumph is still his because of the unity, reverence, and love expressed in the wake of his loss. Within a little more than a week, Mekia Cox,Tyne Stecklein, Timor Steffens, et al  would show the world how to go on like troupers in Michael's absence as they danced on the dais above his casket, while Jennifer Hudson took masterful command of his gospel song, ""Will You Be There?""More people will see this footage of the final exquisite gift Michael intended to present to the world than would have ever been able to see him perform live.He was sharp, and at the top of his game until the very end--a supernova still at his brightest. And our film ends with a final laugh and a dance from the beloved entertainer.The final lines of ""September Song"" are what come to mind in the final analysis of this film: ""...And these few precious days I'll spend with you...These precious days, I'll spend with you.""All my gratitude goes to those who shared this precious footage with us!",5,...As His Days Dwindled Down to a Precious

1284554,A1QAZ8GZVR5F4H,B002R0EIVI,Dee Jazz,"[8, 8]","I knew that I was going to see this movie from the moment I heard the conceptual idea of his rehearsals being made into a motion picture film. I saw it the first night on October 27th at 11pm and I've seen it 3 more times since then.Michael was REMARKABLE and FANTASTIC! I just couldn't get enough of looking at him and feeling his soul up there on that screen. The dancers were on point and the band was jamming every note the way he wanted it; when they had it just right.I read someone's critique of the movie and it said that Michael had on long sleeves during the rehearsals. I would like to say...THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE to me because I'm sure the AIR was on HIGH in the stadium and Michael didn't want to catch a chill and get sick with the flu or get hoarse in his singing voice. I don't know why people make such dumb observations and publish it without thinking through what they are saying.During the 8 hours of my watching Michael upon that screen, I never once felt that he was not here anymore. I was so happy to see him at his most energetic self and showing his finesse and power at the same time. I was smiling and feeling blessed to be watching him make the attempt to bring his Mega-Talent back to the stage for everyone to see that nothing was tarnished about his skills. Throughout the whole movie, each time I watched it, I was totally engaged in every single movement that he made. The only time my eyes left him is, of course, when he wasn't on the screen.My only beef is with one of the theaters where I went to see the movie. The first movie theater closest to my home has the BEST sound system and you can hear every single decible of what's on the screen. The music was rumbling inside of me like I was sitting right there in the stadium with them. But then I went to this other theater to check out a different atmosphere and I was SO NOT HAPPY because the sound system in the speakers seemed to be unbalanced. The music and the voices weren't the same level of pitch or something of that matter. I don't know why they would have a CONCERT MOVIE's sound system setup like that.The 3rd time I went to see the movie was again at the theater nearest my home and I knew then for sure that the other theater's sound system was OFF. The 4th time, I had to go again to the other theater with the bad sound system because it wasn't showing near my home that weekend. I wasn't too happy about that because they actually charge $3 more than the one nearest my home, but I went there again anyway because I HAD TO SEE MICHAEL ONE MORE TIME before they took it from all the theaters. Even with the sound system still unbalanced, I focused on Michael and loved every minute of watching him do his thing, just loving him more and more every second.Also, I never saw the film with more than 25 people in the theaters that I visited. I had wished that I could have seen it at least once with a full theater to feel the energy of everyone enjoying themselves. But then I thought, this was great that I didn't watch it with a lot of people, because I wasn't distracted or annoyed or disturbed by not hearing something being said on the movie because of excessive noise from a crowd. I accepted that as a blessing in disguise and didn't let it bother me because I know that in areas all over the world there were theaters that were filled up on more than one occasion with lots of happy fans.I have a pair of nice wireless headphones that I know will give me great sound at home when I get this DVD in my hands. I'm going to watch Michael in this movie on a regular basis until I can see it in my dreams. LOL And the additional DVDs will be mine, as well. I CAN'T STOP THE LOVE and whatever lets me see him and hear him speaking, singing and dancing is what I have to have in my possession. LOLI hope all the people who didn't take the time to go out and see this movie at the theaters will buy or rent this DVD like crazy because it's worth every single second and every single dime to witness the MASTER at his work.",5,The Amazing Michael Jackson!!!,1259712000,"12 2, 2009",2009,4026,"['knew', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'moment', 'heard', 'conceptual', 'idea', 'rehearsals', 'being', 'made', 'motion', 'picture', 'film', 'saw', 'first', 'night', 'October', '27th', '11pm', ""'ve"", 'seen', '3', 'more', 'times', 'then.Michael', 'was', 'REMARKABLE', 'FANTASTIC', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'looking', 'feeling', 'soul', 'up', 'there', 'screen', 'dancers', 'were', 'point', 'band', 'was', 'jamming', 'note', 'way', 'wanted', 'when', 'had', 'just', 'right.I', 'read', 'someone', 'critique', 'movie', 'said', 'Michael', 'had', 'long', 'sleeves', 'rehearsals', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'THAT', 'WOULD', 'MAKE', 'SENSE', ""'m"", 'sure', 'AIR', 'was', 'HIGH', 'stadium', 'Michael', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'catch', 'chill', 'get', 'sick', 'flu', 'get', 'hoarse', 'singing', 'voice', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'people', 'make', 'such', 'dumb', 'observations', 'publish', 'thinking', 'what', 'are', 'saying.During', '8', 'hours', 'watching', 'Michael', 'screen', 'never', 'once', 'felt', 'was', 'not', 'here', 'anymore', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'most', 'energetic', 'self', 'showing', 'finesse', 'power', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'smiling', 'feeling', 'blessed', 'be', 'watching', 'make', 'attempt', 'bring', 'Mega-Talent', 'back', 'stage', 'everyone', 'see', 'nothing', 'was', 'tarnished', 'skills', 'whole', 'movie', 'time', 'watched', 'was', 'totally', 'engaged', 'single', 'movement', 'made', 'only', 'time', 'eyes', 'left', 'course', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'screen.My', 'only', 'beef', 'one', 'theaters', 'where', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'movie', 'theater', 'closest', 'home', 'BEST', 'sound', 'system', 'can', 'hear', 'single', 'decible', 'what', 'screen', 'music', 'was', 'rumbling', 'inside', 'was', 'sitting', 'right', 'there', 'stadium', 'then', 'went', 'other', 'theater', 'check', 'out', 'different', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'SO', 'NOT', 'HAPPY', 'sound', 'system', 'speakers', 'seemed', 'be', 'unbalanced', 'music', 'voices', 'were', ""n't"", 'same', 'level', 'pitch', 'something', 'matter', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'CONCERT', 'MOVIE', 'sound', 'system', 'setup', '3rd', 'time', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'again', 'theater', 'nearest', 'home', 'knew', 'then', 'sure', 'other', 'theater', 'sound', 'system', 'was', 'OFF', '4th', 'time', 'had', 'go', 'again', 'other', 'theater', 'bad', 'sound', 'system', 'was', ""n't"", 'showing', 'home', 'weekend', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'happy', 'actually', 'charge', '3', 'more', 'one', 'nearest', 'home', 'went', 'there', 'again', 'anyway', 'HAD', 'TO', 'SEE', 'MICHAEL', 'ONE', 'MORE', 'TIME', 'took', 'theaters', 'Even', 'sound', 'system', 'still', 'unbalanced', 'focused', 'Michael', 'loved', 'minute', 'watching', 'do', 'thing', 'just', 'loving', 'more', 'more', 'second.Also', 'never', 'saw', 'film', 'more', '25', 'people', 'theaters', 'visited', 'had', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'least', 'once', 'full', 'theater', 'feel', 'energy', 'everyone', 'enjoying', 'then', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'lot', 'people', 'was', ""n't"", 'distracted', 'annoyed', 'disturbed', 'not', 'hearing', 'something', 'being', 'said', 'movie', 'excessive', 'noise', 'crowd', 'accepted', 'blessing', 'disguise', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'bother', 'know', 'areas', 'world', 'were', 'theaters', 'were', 'filled', 'up', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'lots', 'happy', 'fans.I', 'have', 'pair', 'nice', 'wireless', 'headphones', 'know', 'will', 'give', 'great', 'sound', 'home', 'when', 'get', 'DVD', 'hands', ""'m"", 'going', 'watch', 'Michael', 'movie', 'regular', 'basis', 'can', 'see', 'dreams', 'LOL', 'additional', 'DVDs', 'will', 'be', 'mine', 'as', 'well', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'STOP', 'THE', 'LOVE', 'lets', 'see', 'hear', 'speaking', 'singing', 'dancing', 'what', 'have', 'have', 'possession', 'LOLI', 'hope', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'go', 'out', 'see', 'movie', 'theaters', 'will', 'buy', 'rent', 'DVD', 'crazy', 'worth', 'single', 'second', 'single', 'dime', 'witness', 'MASTER', 'work']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release
1284555,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002R0EIVI,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[18, 19]","Fantastic!  For Michael Jackson fans who love his music, ""This Is It"" represents Michael Jackson's commitment, his passion and his dedication to his music, sharing his love and a message to those around him but most importantly reaching out to his fans. On Blu-ray, fans can expect beautiful visuals but most of all, spectacular lossless audio and also enjoyable and inspiring special features.  Highly recommended!VIDEO & AUDIO:""Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  It's very important to emphasize that this was not a documentary that was planned and they had cameras for the sake of making a movie.  These are films that Michael Jackson had taped for his own personal video of the planning to the actual creation of his concerts and of course the rehearsals.This film was put together within a few months of going through hours upon hours of raw footage and then editing the various film stock (the footage is a mix of High Definition and Standard Definition footage) from the rehearsals and other footage behind-the-scenes.Fortunately, the majority of the footage used are from the high definition source and picture quality for those scenes are just awesome.  You get to see the detail of Michael Jackson's clothing, the various vibrant lighting during the rehearsals including the stage effects and even closeups of Michael Jackson clean shaven to a man with stubble.  Personally, with Michael Jackson having a talented crew, the coverage featured in this film is great and to watch on Blu-ray is very impressive.But where this film shines on Blu-ray is its lossless audio presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  My first impression was ""Wow!"".  Granted, these are rehearsal footage but it's one thing to hear the crystal clear dialogue through the centers and the music from the front channels but to hear sound being utilized through the surround channels and nice, clean bass thumping from the subwoofer was very cool!You can hear Jonathan Moffet's drums jamming while Michael Jackson starts dancing to ""Billy Jean"", Orianthi Panagris jamming on the electric guitar for ""Black and White"" and ""Beat It"" along with Tommy Morgan on guitar and of course, all the musicians and vocalists played a part in this film and it's awesome audio.  Music is just crystal clear and you can hear the nice separation at times with certain instruments on the surrounds but also hear the dancers and whoever is offstage just cheering on Michael Jackson as he's jamming on stage to the interaction with Michale and his backup vocalists or musicians.""It Might Get Loud"" may be my favorite guitar-driven Blu-ray release for its soundtrack but ""Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT"" just sounds fantastic.  Blu-ray fans will not be disappointed.  This is one of the better sounding musical documentaries I have seen on Blu-ray and heard via lossless yet.As for subtitles, ""Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT"" is featured in English, French and English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT"" comes with the following special features presented in 1080p High Definition and audio in English 5.1 Dolby Digital and English Stereo.  Included are:* movieIQ - Featuring the ""This Is It"" Playlist and BD-Live connect you to real-time information on the cast, music, trivia and more while watching the movie! Also includes an interactive playlist where you can bookmark your favorite songs featured in the film and email yourself a customized playlist! NOTE: You need a profile 2.0 Blu-ray player (that connect online) to access movieIQ.* Thriller Vignettes - presented in 5.1 audio - (3:50) The full new short film for ""Thriller"" used as a vignette for the concert which was shown on a big LCD screen and would transition to the main performance of ""Thriller"".  This is a Blu-ray exclusive.* Smooth Criminal Vignettes - presented in 5.1 audio - (3:58) The full new short film for ""Smooth Criminal"" used as a vignette for the concert which was shown on a big LCD screen and would transition to the ""Smooth Criminal"" performance.  This is a Blu-ray exclusive.* Making Smooth Criminal - (11:08) Shooting the short film content for ""Smooth Criminal"" for ""This Is It"".  How they integrated Michael into a noir film using footage from ""Gilda"" (starring Rita Hayworth) and another film with Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson and how it was created.  Also, showing how Michael Jackson was very involved in the production.* Staging the Return - (40:46) A special program on Michael Jackson planning his return to the stage.  From clips of Michael Jackson announcing his return, to behind-the-scenes footage of the creation of the concert, set design to the ""Earth Song"" video and interviews with director Kenny Ortega and the crew and their memories of Michael Jackson.* The Gloved One - (15:11) A look at the costumes created for ""This Is It"" featuring costume designers Michael Bush and Zaldy.  The creation of the outfits and taking them to a new level and Zaldy explains how the costumes came about including an outfit filled with crystals and a metallic studded outfit inspired by samurai uniform to the shoes and more.* Memories of Michael- (16:19) Director Kenny Ortega, the producers and musicians talk about their experience working with Michael Jackson and how they were all inspired by him and how he was a great friend, father and performer.* Auditions: Searching for the World's Best Dancers - (9:50) A look at the auditions for the best professional dancers who would take part in Michael Jackson's ""THIS IS IT"".* Theatrical Trailer - (2:30) The original theatrical trailer.JUDGMENT CALL:After watching ""Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT"", I have to agree...this was the great concert that never happened.  I have never seen production design this incredible in my life and I have watched and reviewed many concerts from artists worldwide and have seen expensive concerts with extravagant to jaw dropping effects.  But after seeing this film and what they had planned, I don't think anyone has come close to the amount of work that was done for ""Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT"".Aside from the awesome vocals, music and choreography that you would expect from a Michael Jackson concert, just seeing the short films that were created for the concert was impressive, the props such as a giant motorized robotic-like spider to a bulldozer coming on stage was amazing to seeing fire going around stage and even a Kevlar jacket that Michael Jackson would wear that would catch on fire.Michael Jackson and his entire team who were working on this concert definitely set the bar higher than anyone in the world has done for their concert and that is why it was so important to have this documentary to be seen.  This was a documentary that showed a man who was involved in the entire process of the creation of the concert, immersing himself in getting prepared and ready but most of all, making sure that because this was his final curtain call, these concerts were definitely his way of going out with a bang.The concerts may not have happened but because of what we see in this film, although the main people watching him were the crew, dancers and technicians, now the entire world has a chance to see the greatest concert that never happened.  But most of all, a chance to see the King of Pop one final time and see how much sweat tears they put into this production.The Blu-ray release of ""Michael Jackson's  THIS IS IT"" is fantastic.  A good number of special features that will make fans happy and again, this is one of the best music films/documentaries in HD for its incredible lossless audio.  Again, this was a film that was created by putting hours of footage together and editing it to make a film.  The footage was never intended to be used for a feature film or documentary.The fact that director Kenny Ortega and crew not only had it ready for the theater, there was not one scene where I got bored, nor was there a scene which I felt could have been left out.Overall, ""Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT"" is one Blu-ray release that fans of Michael Jackson and his music should own.  Absolutely fantastic and highly recommended!",5,"Blu-ray: On Blu-ray, fans can expect beautiful visuals but most of all, spectacular lossless audio!

1284557,A3BK0CLPP35T62,B002R0EIVI,DJ Master K,"[6, 7]","This movie was very nicely done, just like director Ortega says ""For The Fans"".  Michael Jackson was a great talent that will indeed be missed.  In this movie you will again get to see his captivating power and beauty of his soul and his music that made so many people become his fans.  This movie was not made like a documentary.  It was made more like trying to develop a DVD out of the real concert that was to be ""This is It"".  The concert, unfortunately, never got to see the light of day, therefore, this is the next best thing.  And it is the best!  The movie follows song after song, just like songs would be sung in the concert, and Michael sings his songs fully, in their entirety, even though this was just rehearsal.  There are spectacular effects and so much energy generated by Michael and the dancers.  There are some small commentaries in between the songs, and a little bit of interviewing here and there.  There is funny discussion between Michael and the director or the musicians at times.  And for some of the songs, he doesn't sing a few words in a verse, but of course, it was only rehearsal.  And for only a rehearsal, this movie is actually great.  He sings his songs as if they are sung in the studio, not live.  He always aimed for perfection.  And it was this perfection that consumed him too soon and took him away in the end.  But he will always be remembered in our hearts!  And for those who were never hard-core fans, like me, but only appreciated him for the entertainer that he was, I think after seeing this movie you will regret you were never a fan.

He brought a new style of entertaining at a whole new level. It was Amazing especially ""smooth criminal"" how he integrated an old movie into this song, brilliant! Just the 3D effects alone are mind blowing, ""Thriller"" for instance, that would have been great to watch in all of its entirety,along with the powerful ""Earth Song"" and so much more. Michael out did himself in this movie and you can see that in every song, new dance moves. He had a uniqueness and creativeness beyond, and you see it in this movie.And not to mention he sounded GREAT,The king of pop still had it. His true geniuness with his crew, and dancers everything was with LOVE, and inspiration. I loved how Michael said this is your turn to shine, and I will be right here with you to his crew. Michael Jackson transcended LOVE and,His passion for inspiring us to better ourselves and to help save the planet is the message that you walk away with in this film. Michael Jackson was a kind soul, plain and simple.I am so glad that I was able to go and see Michael Jackson last performance,a few of us in the movie theater sang to his songs, you could feel his presence right through the film. It was so warm to embrace all of those who love Michael Jackson and miss him.I cried just alittle bit, but all in all I walked away happy, being able to watch him one last time. There was even the young embracing Michael-I hope he is smiling about this. Now we can with this DVD watch him over and over again, how cool is that.This is must see film you can watch the magic from a man who changed the world on so many levels, who is a genius in the music industry, and a legend for all of his humatarian charities, who deserves to be called THE KING OF POP-MIchael Joseph Jackson- Thank you for all that you have done for us, and leaving your beautiful footprints behind.",5,Amazing,1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,1939,"['went', 'see', 'was', 'awstruck', 'speechless', 'infact', 'what', 'extra', 'phenomenal', 'performer', 'was', 'brought', 'new', 'style', 'entertaining', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'was', 'Amazing', 'especially', 'smooth', 'criminal', 'how', 'integrated', 'old', 'movie', 'song', 'brilliant', 'Just', '3D', 'effects', 'alone', 'are', 'mind', 'blowing', 'Thriller', 'instance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'watch', 'entirety', 'powerful', 'Earth', 'Song', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Michael', 'did', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'song', 'new', 'dance', 'moves', 'had', 'uniqueness', 'creativeness', 'see', 'movie.And', 'not', 'mention', 'sounded', 'GREAT', 'king', 'pop', 'still', 'had', 'true', 'geniuness', 'crew', 'dancers', 'everything', 'was', 'LOVE', 'inspiration', 'loved', 'how', 'Michael', 'said', 'turn', 'shine', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'here', 'crew', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'transcended', 'LOVE', 'passion', 'inspiring', 'better', 'help', 'save', 'planet', 'message', 'walk', 'away', 'film', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'was', 'kind', 'soul', 'plain', 'simple.I', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'was', 'able', 'go', 'see', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'last', 'performance', 'few', 'movie', 'theater', 'sang', 'songs', 'could', 'feel', 'presence', 'right', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'warm', 'embrace', 'who', 'love', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'miss', 'him.I', 'cried', 'just', 'alittle', 'bit', 'walked', 'away', 'happy', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'was', 'even', 'young', 'embracing', 'Michael-I', 'hope', 'smiling', 'Now', 'can', 'DVD', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'how', 'cool', 'that.This', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'magic', 'man', 'who', 'changed', 'world', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'who', 'genius', 'music', 'industry', 'legend', 'humatarian', 'charities', 'who', 'be', 'called', 'THE', 'KING', 'OF', 'POP-MIchael', 'Joseph', 'Jackson-', 'Thank', 'have', 'done', 'leaving', 'beautiful', 'footprints']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

This IS the final curtain call.""  On the surface, we know he meant, no more touring, no more performing.  But prophetically speaking, did he know?  I have been fortunate, as a child, to have seen him and his brothers perform in Atlantic City, NJ's Steel Pier as the Jackson 5ive as well as been present for many of his concerts as a solo artist.  So I have to ask the question again, did Michael Jackson know?  Did he feel somehow that his work here was done and he was leaving us?  Because if what I witnessed last evening was simply 'rehearsal footage' then maybe we, who he left behind, would not have been able to absorb the final product for that concert is playing non-stop on a much greater stage than what we have down here.  That movie/rehearsal is a masterpiece and a most loving, fitting, testament to what happens when GOD touches and enhances a soul.  I don't believe ""This Is It"" was just 120 hours of rehearsal footage for his final concerts, I choose to believe, that Michael Jackson knew.  He was so far ahead of his time, of course he knew and what that movie was and is, is a love letter not only to his children, his family, his fans, friends but to everyone that his music touched and will continue to touch.  This is it to those of us who never had the chance to see him perform while he was here.  This is it to those that saved up and then waited in line to buy tickets to these sold out shows.  This is it to show how 300% goes not only for showtime but for everything leading up to it.  His songs transcended and his music coursed thru you.  Well, it did me.  I can't count how many times he said 'God Bless You' during the film.  I can still see that haunting smile he shone as Kenny Ortega, said 'fade to black' @ the end of the ""They Don't Really Care About Us"" spectacular.  Some will say that ""This Is It"" is the final chapter in the life of an extraordinary talent and humanitarian.  It will be nominated, speculated, win many awards, break world records and then they will make a space on the shelf in the archives, wipe their hands, and be done with it.  Well, the party's not over, I choose to believe it's the start of a whole new book. For as long as there are folks like y'all and me who love this man, his music, what he stood for and tried to do, the rest is not silent and the final curtain has not fallen.

1284562,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002R0EIVI,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 1]","Even though it represents the name of the concert tour, the film's title is a bit of a misnomer because it's more accurate to say this could have been it. Nine months after his death, Michael Jackson is unlikely to move anywhere close to obscurity soon. As the first post-mortem tribute to his legacy, this 2009 documentary, filmed at the Staples Center in LA and directed by choreographer Kenny Ortega (Dirty Dancing), is testament to an idiosyncratic talent driven by an even more amazing level of dedication made up of equal parts anxiety and intuition. In fact, it is his perfectionism that will remain in your memory more than the quality of his performance here, which was never meant to be in a commercial film. For the most part, he sings half-heartedly in order to save his voice for the real shows, but what we do see is Jackson as the master orchestrator of the concert experience.Throughout the 112-minute running time, Jackson never looks like he's taking any aspect of his performance for granted. Rather, he becomes a rather human presence who knows when the music is off a beat or when a dance move is not quite right. A particularly insightful scene occurs when he stands over the keyboard of the show's musical director and tries to coax a specific note out of him. If Barbra Streisand said ""I just want to hear it the way I wrote it"", she would have been accused of diva behavior, but Jackson manages to say it without malice in a way that shows how little it takes for him to make such a demand. There is no doubt who is in charge of the concert, and Ortega often seems to kowtow to Jackson like a personal assistant until the performer's enjoyment on a cherry-picker brings out the watchful parent in the director.Judging from Jackson's clothing, the footage appears to capture him on three separate occasions during the rehearsals, and you can see him rethinking each familiar song with something new like a proposed fiery ending to ""Beat It"" a la Jimi Hendrix. Even though some of his performances are ragged, even unpolished, there are key highlights to savor such as Jackson's a capella version of ""Human Nature"", a genuinely edgy take on ""Black or White"" complete with a sharp guitar solo from Orianthi Panagaris, and the film noir treatment of ""Smooth Criminal"" with his fedora-wearing character melding into archival footage of Rita Hayworth (Gilda) and Humphrey Bogart (The Big Sleep). In fact, several of the numbers come with mini-movies like a Tim Burton-influenced take on ""Thriller"" and a bucolic fantasyland for ""Earth Song"". Interview snippets featuring musicians, singers, choreographers and costume designers are interspersed throughout.In the end, the film feels like an elaborate home movie of a worshipped performer who refuses to rest on his laurels and instead wants to show his relevance for the next generation. Although painfully thin and with an overly reconstructed face, Jackson doesn't give any indication of his pending death in the footage, and I'm sure that was quite deliberate given his family had approval of the final cut. It's worth seeing for what could have been quite a sensational concert comeback. The 2010 DVD contains six featurettes that focus on various aspects of the production; showcase two of the mini-movies in their entirety, ""Thriller"" and ""Smooth Criminal""; and present a post-mortem tribute from those who worked with him in those final weeks.",4,A Fitting Tribute to the Gloved One as a Master Orchestrator,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,3419,"['Even', 'name', 'concert', 'tour', 'film', 'title', 'bit', 'misnomer', 'more', 'accurate', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Nine', 'months', 'death', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'unlikely', 'move', 'anywhere', 'close', 'obscurity', 'soon', 'first', 'post-mortem', 'tribute', 'legacy', '2009', 'documentary', 'filmed', 'Staples', 'Center', 'LA', 'directed', 'choreographer', 'Kenny', 'Ortega', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'testament', 'idiosyncratic', 'talent', 'driven', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'level', 'dedication', 'made', 'equal', 'parts', 'anxiety', 'intuition', 'fact', 'perfectionism', 'will', 'remain', 'memory', 'more', 'quality', 'performance', 'here', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'commercial', 'film', 'most', 'part', 'half-heartedly', 'order', 'save', 'voice', 'real', 'shows', 'what', 'do', 'see', 'Jackson', 'master', 'orchestrator', 'concert', '112-minute', 'running', 'time', 'Jackson', 'never', 'taking', 'aspect', 'performance', 'granted', 'Rather', 'rather', 'human', 'presence', 'who', 'when', 'music', 'beat', 'when', 'dance', 'move', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'particularly', 'insightful', 'scene', 'when', 'keyboard', 'show', 'musical', 'director', 'tries', 'coax', 'specific', 'note', 'Barbra', 'Streisand', 'said', 'just', 'want', 'hear', 'way', 'wrote', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'accused', 'diva', 'behavior', 'Jackson', 'say', 'malice', 'way', 'how', 'little', 'make', 'such', 'demand', 'doubt', 'who', 'charge', 'concert', 'Ortega', 'often', 'kowtow', 'Jackson', 'personal', 'assistant', 'performer', 'enjoyment', 'cherry-picker', 'out', 'watchful', 'parent', 'director.Judging', 'Jackson', 'clothing', 'footage', 'capture', 'three', 'separate', 'occasions', 'rehearsals', 'can', 'see', 'rethinking', 'familiar', 'song', 'something', 'new', 'proposed', 'fiery', 'ending', 'Beat', 'la', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Even', 'performances', 'are', 'ragged', 'even', 'unpolished', 'are', 'key', 'highlights', 'savor', 'such', 'Jackson', 'capella', 'version', 'Human', 'Nature', 'genuinely', 'edgy', 'take', 'Black', 'White', 'complete', 'sharp', 'guitar', 'solo', 'Orianthi', 'Panagaris', 'film', 'noir', 'treatment', 'Smooth', 'Criminal', 'fedora-wearing', 'character', 'melding', 'archival', 'footage', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', 'Gilda', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Big', 'Sleep', 'fact', 'several', 'numbers', 'come', 'mini-movies', 'Tim', 'Burton-influenced', 'take', 'Thriller', 'bucolic', 'fantasyland', 'Earth', 'Song', 'Interview', 'featuring', 'musicians', 'singers', 'choreographers', 'costume', 'designers', 'are', 'interspersed', 'end', 'film', 'feels', 'elaborate', 'home', 'movie', 'worshipped', 'performer', 'who', 'rest', 'laurels', 'instead', 'show', 'relevance', 'next', 'generation', 'painfully', 'thin', 'overly', 'reconstructed', 'face', 'Jackson', ""n't"", 'give', 'indication', 'pending', 'death', 'footage', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'quite', 'deliberate', 'given', 'family', 'had', 'approval', 'final', 'cut', 'worth', 'seeing', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'sensational', 'concert', 'comeback', '2010', 'DVD', 'six', 'featurettes', 'focus', 'various', 'aspects', 'production', 'two', 'mini-movies', 'entirety', 'Thriller', 'Smooth', 'Criminal', 'present', 'post-mortem', 'tribute', 'who', 'worked', 'final', 'weeks']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

1284568,A3GLJM6FQREL3Y,B002R0EIVI,Enrique A. Leon,"[0, 0]","Michael Jackson's This Is It(commonly known as This Is It) is a 2009 American documentary?concert film directed by Kenny Ortega that documents Michael Jackson's rehearsals and preparation for the concert series of the same name scheduled to start on July 13, 2009, but canceled due to his death eighteen days prior on June 25. The film is now the highest grossing concert movie and documentary in the history of cinema.[6]The film consists of Jackson rehearsing musical numbers and directing his team, and additional behind the scenes footage including dancer auditions and costume design. The film's director Kenny Ortega confirmed that none of this footage was originally intended for release, but after Jackson's death it was agreed that the film be made for his fans. Ortega dedicated the film to Jackson's three children. The footage was filmed at both the Staples Center arena and The Forum in Los Angeles, California. Despite originally being set for October 30, the film's release date was rescheduled for October 28, 2009 due to a strong demand by Jackson's fans. The film was given a wide worldwide release and a limited two-week theatrical run from October 28, to November 12, 2009. Tickets went on sale a month early on September 27, 2009, to satisfy a high anticipated demand; to date, the film has broken numerous records via tickets both pre-sale and sales worldwide.Since the film's confirmation, AEG Live has faced criticism; mostly consisting of claims that they had only made the film to make a profit. Multiple members of Jackson's family had confirmed that they didn't support the film and some family members went as far as to try to stop the film agreement in August. The film has also been surrounded by multiple controversies, including allegations regarding the appearance of body doubles in place of Jackson; which Sony denied, and an outrage from Jackson fans; with some going as far as to start a protest against the film. On August 10, 2009, a judge approved a deal between Jackson's estate, concert promoter AEG Live concert promoter AEG Live, and Sony Pictures. The agreement allowed Sony to edit the hundreds of hours of rehearsal footage needed to create the film. Sony subsequently paid $60 million for the film rights.[7]The trailer premiered during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13, 2009, along with the simultaneous launching of the film's official website.[8]The film was released to mainly positive reviews from both critics and Jackson fans; the film's portrayal of Jackson and his performances were generally praised, while criticism mainly consisted of both critics and fans having felt that the film was made just to profit off Jackson's death and that Jackson wouldn't have wanted the film released because he was a ""perfectionist"". In the film's opening weekend it grossed over $23 million - in the United States alone - making the film number one at the box office[5]and making it the fifth highest-grossing Halloween debut.[6]The film's worldwide revenue gross was in total $259.3 million during its theatrical run making it the highest grossing documentary or concert movie of all time. The film begins with a short text introduction stating the purpose of the footage and its intent ""For the fans..."". After short dialogues from various dancers, Kenny Ortega is heard talking through the original concert opening sequence involving a body suit made from screens which display fast clips and images with bright intensity from which Jackson emerges on stage. Immediately after this, Jackson begins ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" first solo, which pauses half-way through and a small snippet of Jackson singing his song ""Speechless"" acapella is shown. Jackson is then joined by dancers and completes the first number. A short clip showing rehearsals of the ""toaster"" mechanism is shown before rehearsal footage of ""Jam"" is played. This plays directly into the green screen adaption of soldiers dancers for ""Bad"" which are also used for ""They Don't Care About Us"" which is shown next. From here, the film shows Michael directing Ortega and his band for his solo rehearsal performance of ""Human Nature"" which he performs acapella, then acoustic and finally with full band. Green screen rehearsals for the video vignette for ""Smooth Criminal"" come next (with scenes from the film Gildalike the one where Rita Hayworth sings ""Put the Blame on Mame""), with dress rehearsals of the song following, including parts of the vignette intertwined with the dancing. Jackson is seen next directing his musical team for the cues in his song ""The Way You Make Me Feel."" Jackson then performs a rehearsal with dancers which he alters and changes as he goes. A small animatic introducing the Jackson 5 is shown afterwards, and Michael then rehearses Jackson 5 songs: ""I Want You Back"", ""The Love You Save"", ""I'll Be There"" and ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)."" Before he concludes ""I'll Be There"", Jackson tells his brothers and his parents that he loves them. Jackson stops only to report problems with his earpiece. After this, Jackson sings with Judith Hill, one of his back up singers, on his duet song ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" in which he sings at full strength, directing his partner as he goes. The filming for the ""Thriller"" vignette is then shown with Jackson and Ortega watching with 3D glasses. Jackson is then seen rehearsing ""Thriller"" with the vignette intertwined like that in ""Smooth Criminal."" Footage of the show's aerialists rehearsing to the instrumental of ""Who Is It"" is shown next.During the dance sequence, puppets are suspended in the audience aisles while Jackson emerges from a robotic spider originally seen in the vignette. Jackson and Ortega rehearsing the cherry-picker is seen next, along with Jackson rehearsing ""Beat It."" Jackson creates the ending he wants for the song, a long drum build up in which he tears off his jacket and burns it. Footage of Jackson and the band rehearsing ""Black Or White"" is shown next, in which he instructs his band to skip the second verse and later allows guitarist Orianthi Panagaris to take center stage to finish with a high guitar rift. The video-sequence for ""Earth Song"" is shown next, featuring a little girl who wanders through an abundant forest, falls asleep, and wakes up to find the forest destroyed by man. Jackson then performs the song both onstage and using the cherry-picker, with his voice being heard at the end telling of the dangers of Global Warming and the lack of reversible time left. Afterwards, Michael is seen conversing with Ortega, his dancers and band about the shows, trivial dance moves and his hopes for the concert series. He then performs a quick version of his song ""Billie Jean"" featuring an extra dance sequence. Michael is then seen talking to all crew members and wishing everyone the best for the London performances. At a sound check, Jackson performs ""Man In The Mirror"" with strong backing vocals. The movie concludes with Jackson's arms extended on stage and the message: ""Michael Jackson King of Pop, Love Lives Forever"". The credits are shown next, with a montage of rehearsal clips and ""This Is It"" being played in the background. After the show, a live recording of ""Heal The World"" was played. Then, the audio of ""Human Nature"" was played, with an exclusive clip of Michael rehearsing it on his last day. Then, a clip of what could have been a Dome Project video of ""Heal The World"" was shown, in which the girl that appeared in the ""Earth Song"" video was shown holding the world and a signed message, by Michael, saying ""I Love You"" followed by his own signature. Then, a message appeared, saying ""This film is dedicated to Michael's three children; Prince Michael Jackson, Jr., Paris Michael Katherine Jackson,& Prince Michael Jackson II (""Blanket"").""

1284569,A1CHM200OEN65X,B002R0EIVI,"Eric Wilson ""novelist""","[3, 3]","After the tragic death of a pop icon, I was skeptical of the motives behind this DVD. Were they squeezing money out of a canceled concert? Taking advantage of a bad situation? And would the movie focus on the tragedy, with scant footage of the actual music and dancing? For these reasons, I had low hopes when my wife talked me into getting this. We both experienced the phenomenon of ""Thriller"" in the early 80s, as teens, but I doubted this could capture that same excitement.""This is It"" was a wonderful surprise. We get a close up view of the planned tour in its final days of rehearsal. We hear the enthusiasm of the dancers, and marvel at their abilities. All of them, of course, are inspired by Michael himself, and the King of Pop delivers here, showing that he had lost none of his form even in the days before his death. He pops, locks, sings, squeals, with all the energy I remembered. There are a few stumbles, which is why they call it a rehearsal, but overall, I felt I was catching the vibe of the intended show.Not only do we get an intimate look at the rehearsal process, with some incredible effects for ""Thriller"" and others, we hear some of Michael's creative process. Particularly impressive, in light of today's tendency toward pretaped sounds and music, the entire show is done with a cast of musicians on stage, producing tight sounds and heart-pounding beats.If you're looking for insights into Michael Jackson's death, you'll find none of that here, but if you're looking for his passion, imagination, and musical skills, ""This is It.""",5,Surprised,1265241600,"02 4, 2010",2010,1561,"['tragic', 'death', 'pop', 'icon', 'was', 'skeptical', 'motives', 'DVD', 'Were', 'squeezing', 'money', 'canceled', 'concert', 'Taking', 'advantage', 'bad', 'situation', 'would', 'movie', 'focus', 'tragedy', 'scant', 'footage', 'actual', 'music', 'dancing', 'reasons', 'had', 'low', 'hopes', 'when', 'wife', 'talked', 'getting', 'experienced', 'phenomenon', 'Thriller', 'early', '80s', 'teens', 'doubted', 'could', 'capture', 'same', 'excitement', 'was', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'get', 'close', 'up', 'view', 'planned', 'tour', 'final', 'days', 'rehearsal', 'hear', 'enthusiasm', 'dancers', 'marvel', 'abilities', 'course', 'are', 'inspired', 'Michael', 'King', 'Pop', 'delivers', 'here', 'showing', 'had', 'lost', 'none', 'form', 'even', 'days', 'death', 'locks', 'sings', 'squeals', 'energy', 'remembered', 'are', 'few', 'stumbles', 'why', 'call', 'rehearsal', 'overall', 'felt', 'was', 'catching', 'vibe', 'intended', 'show.Not', 'only', 'do', 'get', 'intimate', 'look', 'rehearsal', 'process', 'incredible', 'effects', 'Thriller', 'others', 'hear', 'Michael', 'creative', 'process', 'Particularly', 'impressive', 'light', 'today', 'tendency', 'pretaped', 'sounds', 'music', 'entire', 'show', 'done', 'cast', 'musicians', 'stage', 'producing', 'tight', 'sounds', 'heart-pounding', 'beats.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'insights', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'death', ""'ll"", 'find', 'none', 'here', ""'re"", 'looking', 'passion', 'imagination', 'musical', 'skills']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

Coming into this release I was expecting a documentary with a lot of people talking about how sorry they feel and footage of the rehearsal but this ain't that at all. These are the actual compiled performances with dancers, back screen 3D footage, props and even newly recorded HD video segments that serve as intros to the songs. Of course these do not have the final look but they do feature live playing and singing. You can really see him gesture and dance as he was doing it in front of thousand people.

But this film was more of a celebration of his talent and I didn't feel sad at all. I saw it in the theater, and the running time seemed to be 5 minutes - I enjoyed it that much. The only thing I may have been sad about was when the film was over! Never a dull moment, it shows MJ putting this incredible show together. From auditioning the dancers, to the lights, the band rehearsals, filming all the video elements - he was the man in charge of it all. And what a wicked sense of humor he had! MJ loved to laugh! I know members of his family were concerned that the film shows Michael only operating at about 80%, and this rehearsal footage was never meant to be shown. I can understand the concern. During some of the musical numbers, Mike does seem to be saving his voice and conserving his energy. To me this is completely understandable. I believe he wanted to save everything he had for the actual live performance in front of an audience. There are not too many artists that would get away with this. Rehearsals are painstaking, tedious, and exhausting - but absolutely crucial so that every single member of the cast and crew knows exactly what they are doing and when. With MJ, when the lights go down - all you had to do was turn him loose. He was in complete and total control. To everyone who had concerns that this rehearsal footage would put Mike in a bad light, I will say this - even on a bad day, even on an ""80%"" day, MJ was light years above any other performer. This is true talent. Talent that cannot be learned or rehearsed. This is the talent that was given to him. This is the talent that he shared with us. This is why MJ will always be the King!

1284578,A3BWP965RIWBCU,B002R0EIVI,"Gerald Parker ""Gerald Parker""","[9, 36]","There is no doubt that much money, talent, and skill went into the preparations for this show that never opened or toured, due to Michael Jackson's precipitate death at age 50.  The footage from films of rehearsals at various stages of preparation was assembled, providing continuity within constant changes of scenic assets, of costume and other garb, and so forth.  I saw this film in a cinema theatre when I had gone there and paid to see a different film, but the experience was not a total loss, although the inadvertent switch had me feeling pretty vexed!  As a trained musician myself (one who, among other things, played as bassist in a soul group that, long ago, had a lucky chance to tour the world) and a keenly observant fan of skilled dancing, I can savour the sheer expertise of this production's filmed rehearsals.For a man (or perhaps, given his rather weird looks and manners, some kind of odd humanoid) of that age, Jackson comes across as surprisingly spry (but this may simply be due to deceptive appearances, i.e. to his boyishly slim physique). In this film, Jackson's voice seems too thin and worn to rise to the challenge of the music. I would characterise Michael Jackson's singing in ""This Is It"" as all chirp, twitter, whimper, and whine. Jackson does not hold phrases at much length, apparently no longer able to do that, as he did so admirably when younger.  More sustained phrasing would help to convey some of these songs' melodic curves (as Jackson could phrase them so very well, indeed, when he was younger). In ""This Is It"" the music comes from Jackson's throat in short jabs with very frequent breathing.  That is fine in a song that is more rhythmically (rather than melodically) based, which this sort of delivery would suit (which is the case with some of the material that he sings in ""This Is It"", but far from all of it.)  Michael Jackson really did know how to write some fine and melodically striking songs. All of these signs of decline make his delivery very uneven and unsustained. Since much of the material is far from recent, Jackson should have tried to vocalise songs, if he were capable of doing so, with greater melodic continuity, as he had done so, exceptionally well, earlier in life.However, it may be that Jackson's state of health, undermined by his erratic and increasingly sefl-indulgent living and behaviour, rather than his sheer eccentricity, which well may be the primary reason for the decline in his singing and dancing, both being activities which require a performer to stay in good physical condition to achieve optimal results.  As William Alexander wrote (for Amazon.com), ""[N]o amount of glam and glitz can cover the fact that the enigmatic celebrity was in serious decline. To me, he appeared rickety and ill, his voice enfeebled and incapable of the range [that] once [had been] so effortless, and his dancing [was] lacking in the serpentine, frenetic, sexual urgency that once made it so visually commanding. It was, I thought, a picture of a man in serious physical trouble, a ghost of his former greatness. And that is sad, sad indeed.""  However, Jackson's sheer musicianship and sense of timing remain extraordinary, even in such a diminished state; he has the material, which is essencially all his own, mastered down to the last detail, for what he, the instrumentalists, back-up singers, and his group of dancers all do.The best element of the production is the dancing. Jackson himself moves with quick but arbitrary motions, too reliant on gimics of hip-thrusting, crotch-grabbing (at least, on such occasions, his own), and some steps on which his stage movement long had relied rather formulaically.  Jackson's dancing consists mostly of pitty-pat and small gestures, without much the grander stepping and gestures, at high energy level, so evident in his earlier work, when the music and/or lyrics suggested (as they so often did) such displays of exuberance. This small scale of what Jackson's dancing in ""This Is It"" probably is due partly to the flagging strength of advancing age, but surely also to Jackson's increasing eccentricity, which made his dancing and gestures increasingly solipsistic and uncommunicative. Whatever it was that Jackson meant, in these dance movements in ""This Is It"", it does not come across clearly enough to convey very much what the songs  express in music and words, either at specific moments or in general.  It is even possible that look-alike stand-ins for Jackson do some of the dancing in the film, maybe some of the singing, too, rather than Jackson himself; if that be so, this could account for the disconnect that one feels in ""This Is It"" with the quality of what Jackson himself in the past had accomplished. In recent weeks I have been viewing some videos of Jackson's earlier work, which has helped to refresh my memory of just how good Jackson could be (and was) when the man was younger, healthier, and saner.Too much of the choreography in ""This Is It"", both for Jackson himself to dance, and for the chorus-line of mostly male dancers to execute, amounts to mere wriggle-and-squirm, but the supporting dancers do acquit themselves excellently, given what they have to perform.  When the boys really have a chance to do some show-dancing worthy of the name, they cover themselves in glory; best of all were some touches here and there of very virtuosic (and impressively acrobatic) breakdancing which I enjoyed and admired immensely and I only wish that there were more of that!The big production numbers are effective, too. Here, at least, some acting that he does distracts from Jackson's spasmodic dancing, and the routines are clever and imaginative. I liked best the sequence mimicking in a stylised way the glamour and antics of 1930s and 1940s gangster action films. Perhaps these production qualities and the excellent musicianship of it all make the extra features of a two-disc ""collector's"" edition (already available in the U.K. and in France), or the added quality of the Blu-Ray edition, worth it, but only, I would vouchsafe, for those who are unconditional Michael Jackson fans. For others, the single-disc DVD edition (or nothing of this at all) suffices.If you like Jackson, you will love this one, I suppose. If you are not a True (and unconditional) Believer in Jackson and Jacksomania (as I cussedly am not, although I certainly do appreciate Michael Jackson's brilliant earlier work), at least there are a few striking things and some good moments in this film. Some of the songs rise melodically high above what can be the noisy hum-drum of the compositional quality of much of the other music, which, however, always is superbly arranged and executed.",3,"Mostly Glitter and Glamour, but with Poor Solo Vocalism on Michael Jackson's Part and Only Sporadically Striking Choreography",1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,6714,"['doubt', 'much',

From the firt time I saw him on TV and then seeing him live on stage, I knew he was special.  Not special like a friend, but special in a way that,  not until the day he died, did I realize he would not be a part of this world forever.  He was just that amazing to me, and when I saw this movie, I felt a sense of warmth over me, realizing at that moment, that although he is now in a peaceful place, his time on this earth was done, and ""This is It"" was really his last curtain call.  This is all we were suppose to see of Michael.  This is it!For me it was the Michael I never got to see.  The Raw, Passionate, Emotional and Hard-working Michael!  I have always seen Michael if not on stage performing, in movies, doing interviews (the few that he did do) out and about with his kids, his entourage, and so on, but this was truly the real deal.  Maybe it was the movie theater, the seating, I don't know, but for almost 2 hours, I was apart of Michaels world and what gave him joy. The Stage snd entertaining.  He was so much apart of these rehearsals for what would have been a fantastic show, you knew this was Michael at his best, and the better of that was yet to come, but never will. But in all honesty its okay!For more than 40 years he has touched so many lives through his music and his kind heart, and although his death was a tragedy, and should not have happened, the bottom line is he was truly a work of art.

Michael Jackson's life was made far too public and this brief recording of the preparations for his final tour sets much straight about why he was such a remarkable talent. It allows us to forget all the raucous press that hounded him during his life and simply watch Michael Jackson doing what he did best - perform. Some of his gifts can be listed. Creative body language that permanently influenced dance movements both popular and classical. Articulation of his sensitivity to even the minor details of his performances. Total involvement in whatever he performed.  His genuine kindness in dealing with both his troupe of musicians and dancers as well as his producers/stagehands/publicists.  A mind that could push the edges of entertainment like few others. A seemingly indefatigable energy level while rehearsing. A genuine love for his audience and yes, for life.  One could wish that the DVD showed the completed THIS IS IT show as there couldn't have been more than one more day of rehearsals before is tragic death.  But maybe that will come later.  What this DVD preserves is the quality of uniqueness that was Michael Jackson.

1284585,A1IFCQ7CC2TMFC,B002R0EIVI,gunngirl,"[4, 4]","Using the word *comeback* would do Michael a disservice. He was always here, just awaiting his return. ""This Is It"" only reminds us of Michael Jackson's phenomenal talent and overpowering persona as a master musician, musical genius, showman, creative mastermind and genuinely humble, funny and loving person.This is a remarkable movie, astounding sound and wonderfully edited. We are treated to dress rehearsals and song rehearsals for Michael's London shows, getting a peek at what would have truly been the greatest concert ever produced and performed. Michael re-imagined ""Thriller"" and ""Smooth Criminal"" while also giving us staples like ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"" ""Wanna be Startin' Somethin'"" and ""Human Nature"".While Michael looks underweight in some scenes, he is still clearly in top form physically and mentally, never tiring and seemed ready to meet the challenges of touring. He is on top of his game, commanding the stage in a bossy yet endearing manner; he knows his songs inside and out and wants nothing less than perfection and his dancers and crew happily comply. Ortega is in control in his own right, but certainly never forgets who is the real boss. He is humble and respectful, but knows what he's doing and is Michael's excellent right hand man. He genuinely likes Michael and wants these to be the shows of shows. Over the top is not in his vocabulary.As a reviewer noted, this was a prime opportunity to mess things up and mess up his legacy. If you are thinking 'how is that possible?' It's possible. It's all in the footage and editing and they did an excellent job. I know there are conspiracies that the footage chosen just masks many days of a frail, feeble Michael who would struggle through 10 shows, let alone 50. I believe Michael had bad days, but overall, OVERALL Michael was ready. ""This Is It"" is a sure testament that Michael was excited to be doing what he not only loved, but was born to do: Entertain. He owned the stage and it was home. There was an almost angelic glow around him when he was in his element; Michael practically had his own brand of musical hearing. I believed he could hear notes, key changes and beats that no one else did. The slightest chord off kilter would set him on fire. Remarkable and amazing to watch. When he said ""Let it sizzle"" you actually knew what he meant, it made his musicians better musicians.We're told this footage was for his own personal library, and some people think Michael would not want us to see him being anything less than perfect--the thing is, even in practice he was, oddly, perfect. I think it was hard for him to do anything--musically anyway--so bad he wouldn't want us to see. He hit the melodies of Human Nature so perfectly you wondered if the record was playing.The stage shows would have blown people away, from the Thriller 3D and ""Smooth Criminal"" video immersion alone, before we even got to the million man march of ""They Don't Really Care About Us"" and the ever remarkable ""Billie Jean"" number. Michael was not lying when he said he would get ""nourished"" from his audience. When the audience saw this concert live he would have absorbed so much love he might have imploded.Speaking of Love, it is also a running theme. Michael loves everyone it seems, and is not afraid to say it. He scolds and corrects with L.O.V.E. and it is great. He is fun and funny, jokes and flirts and is always polite and sweet. Talk about a dream boss! Michael is the ultimate performer and a beautiful person inside and out.Michael's loss to the world and music world still stings and it is sad that his tireless dancers and crew did not get to make history, but to grace the stage with the master has to mean something. Michael Jackson fans will drool over this movie--which steers clear of anything negative. We're here for his music legacy and we get it. Ortega gets a pat on the back. You can not watch just once, I hope the DVD gives more songs in their entirety. Excellent and a must see in theaters.I still cannot believe he is gone. I lived in my own reality that he could never die. It is quite depressing that these are his last moments, but I am happy to have them. I am grateful that instead of remembering rumors of the propofol overdose and the rush to the hospital and the memorial as my last images, I have Michael being joyful and funny doing what he loved to do. It gives slight closure to the most remarkable, fascinating, ingenious, humble person who ever graced this earth. We will never get another one. His Legacy will never die.I will love him forever.",5,Michael still remains the King,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,4562,"['Using', 'word', '*comeback*', 'would', 'do', 'Michael', 'disservice', 'was', 'always', 'here', 'just', 'awaiting', 'return', 'only', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'phenomenal', 'talent', 'overpowering', 'persona', 'master', 'musician', 'musical', 'genius', 'showman', 'creative', 'mastermind', 'genuinely', 'humble', 'funny', 'loving', 'person.This', 'remarkable', 'movie', 'astounding', 'sound', 'wonderfully', 'edited', 'are', 'treated', 'dress', 'rehearsals', 'song', 'rehearsals', 'Michael', 'London', 'shows', 'getting', 'peek', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'truly', 'been', 'greatest', 'concert', 'ever', 'produced', 'performed', 'Michael', 're-imagined', 'Thriller', 'Smooth', 'Criminal', 'also', 'giving', 'staples', 'Beat', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'Wan', 'na', 'be', 'Startin', 'Somethin', 'Human', 'Nature', 'Michael', 'underweight', 'scenes', 'still', 'clearly', 'top', 'form', 'physically', 'mentally', 'never', 'tiring', 'seemed', 'ready', 'meet', 'challenges', 'touring', 'top', 'game', 'commanding', 'stage', 'bossy', 'yet', 'endearing', 'manner', 'songs', 'nothing', 'less', 'perfection', 'dancers', 'crew', 'happily', 'comply', 'Ortega', 'control', 'own', 'right', 'certainly', 'never', 'forgets', 'who', 'real', 'boss', 'humble', 'respectful', 'what', 'doing', 'Michael', 'excellent', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'genuinely', 'Michael', 'be', 'shows', 'shows', 'top', 'not', 'vocabulary.As', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'was', 'prime', 'opportunity', 'mess', 'things', 'up', 'mess', 'up', 'legacy', 'are', 'thinking', ""'how"", 'possible', 'possible', 'footage', 'editing', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'know', 'are', 'conspiracies', 'footage', 'chosen', 'just', 'masks', 'many', 'days', 'frail', 'feeble', 'Michael', 'who', 'would', 'struggle', '10', 'shows', 'let', 'alone', '50', 'believe', 'Michael', 'had', 'bad', 'days', 'overall', 'OVERALL', 'Michael', 'was', 'ready', 'sure', 'testament', 'Michael', 'was', 'excited', 'be', 'doing', 'what', 'not', 'only', 'loved', 'was', 'born', 'do', 'Entertain', 'owned', 'stage', 'was', 'home', 'was', 'almost', 'angelic', 'glow', 'around', 'when', 'was', 'element', 'Michael', 'practically', 'had', 'own', 'brand', 'musical', 'hearing', 'believed', 'could', 'hear', 'notes', 'key', 'changes', 'beats', 'one', 'else', 'did', 'slightest', 'chord', 'kilter', 'would', 'set', 'fire', 'Remarkable', 'amazing', 'watch', 'When', 'said', 'Let', 'sizzle', 'actually', 'knew', 'what', 'meant', 'made', 'musicians', 'better', 'musicians.We', ""'re"", 'told', 'footage', 'was', 'own', 'personal', 'library', 'people', 'think', 'Michael', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'being', 'anything', 'less', 'perfect', 'thing', 'even', 'practice', 'was', 'oddly', 'perfect', 'think', 'was', 'hard', 'do', 'anything', 'musically', 'anyway', 'so', 'bad', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'hit', 'melodies', 'Human', 'Nature', 'so', 'perfectly', 'wondered', 'record', 'was', 'playing.The', 'stage', 'shows', 'would', 'have', 'blown', 'people', 'away', 'Thriller', '3D', 'Smooth', 'Criminal', 'video', 'immersion', 'alone', 'even', 'got', 'million', 'man', 'march', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Really', 'Care', 'Us', 'ever', 'remarkable', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'number', 'Michael', 'was', 'not', 'lying', 'when', 'said', 'would', 'get', 'nourished', 'audience', 'When', 'audience', 'saw', 'concert', 'live', 'would', 'have', 'absorbed', 'so', 'much', 'might', 'have', 'imploded.Speaking', 'Love', 'also', 'running', 'theme', 'Michael', 'everyone', 'not', 'afraid', 'say', 'corrects', 'L.O.V.E', 'great', 'fun', 'funny', 'jokes', 'flirts', 'always', 'polite', 'sweet', 'Talk', 'dream', 'boss', 'Michael', 'ultimate', 'performer', 'beautiful', 'person', 'loss', 'world', 'music', 'world', 'still', 'stings', 'sad', 'tireless', 'dancers', 'crew', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'make', 'history', 'grace', 'stage', 'master', 'mean', 'something', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'fans', 'will', 'drool', 'movie', 'steers', 'clear', 'anything', 'negative', ""'re"", 'here', 'music', 'legacy', 'get', 'Ortega', 'pat', 'back', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'just', 'once', 'hope', 'DVD', 'more', 'songs', 'entirety', 'Excellent', 'must', 'see', 'theaters.I', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'gone', 'lived', 'own', 'reality', 'could', 'never', 'die', 'quite', 'depressing', 'are', 'last', 'moments', 'am', 'happy', 'have', 'am', 'grateful', 'instead', 'remembering', 'rumors', 'propofol', 'overdose', 'rush', 'hospital', 'memorial', 'last', 'images', 'have', 'Michael', 'being', 'joyful', 'funny', 'doing', 'what', 'loved', 'do', 'slight', 'closure', 'most', 'remarkable', 'fascinating', 'ingenious', 'humble', 'person', 'who', 'ever', 'graced', 'earth', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'one', 'Legacy', 'will', 'never', 'die.I', 'will', 'love', 'forever']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

If you're not a fan, you won't agree, and you certainly won't understand. His music, his dance style, and his unbeatable charitable contributions to many organizations, are all pieces of that creative Michael Jackson puzzle that we all craved to explore, that we all missed because we were too busy judging him, and that we all long for now, but all we can do now is cherish the memories and legacy of the music contributions he left behind. The ""This Is It"" film is entertaining enough if you just want to have one more glance of Michael in action before his untimely death. Many complain that this DVD is not a five star performance. Of course it's not. But it's not a failed attempt at immortalizing him either. This DVD gives us a peek inside his last rehearsal performances. We get to see the making of what I think was going to be one hell of a great tour had he lived to complete the tour he had planned. My reasons for liking and buying this DVD is simple. I like it because it is his last performance. I like it because I am a fan.

1284595,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B002R0EIVI,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[8, 8]","In March of 2009, Michael Jackson announced a final 10 show concert run, This Is It, to be played at London's O2 Arena. Due to high demand for tickets, the concert was changed to 50 concerts to be played between July of 2009 and March of 2010. Sadly, Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009, and the grand vision of This Is It was never completely carried. Thankfully though, the rehearsals were recorded for Jackson's personal use, and are now presented by Kenny Ortega (director of This Is It) and AEG Live to show the world Michael Jackson's vision for what could have been the biggest concert series of his career.Michael Jackson was the consumate performer, forgetting about his personal troubles, he was known equally for his dancing and for his singing talent. From a young age he could imbue a song with emotion that even seasoned musicians had a hard time conveying. With his first solo album, Off The Wall, he sold over 20 million copies and the album was certified 8x platinum. But his true magnum opus, Thriller, spawned 7 singles (the album had 9 songs) has sold an estimated 65-110 million copies, making it the best selling album of all time. The video Billie Jean was the video that helped bring MTv into the limelight, and was also the first video by a black artist to be played on regular rotation by the network, while Thriller, is still considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time. And that's not even counting the millions of copies sold of his other albums after that. Even in death, Michael outsold the billboard charts for weeks after his death, and three weeks after his death, Thriller became the most sold album of the year to that point, surpassing Taylor Swift. With a legacy so prolific, does This Is It live up to the rest?This Is It is not the morbid experience some people are going to expect. I'm sure some people are going to be watching for hints at his personal life, or for clues of his failing health looking for someone kind of explanation for his death. What you will get is the King of Pop in top form. He has never sounded better, and for 50, he keeps up well with his 20 something counterparts dancing on stage with him. His choreography is still top notch, and you see the genius behind the man. This is it truly is a celebration of the life and music of a genius entertainer and artist, and a perfectionist. Throughout the rehearsals you see him stop and telling people exactly how he wants to hear and see songs performed. This huge production was completely overseen by Michael Jackson, not created by a team for Michael, but created by Michael, and told to the team that he needed to create it for him.And make no mistake, this was a huge production. Throughout, the movie you see some of what was planned for the visual conterparts to the stage performance, and it was just massive! Thriller included ghosts and a graveyard scene including zombies and a giant spider, all shot to be shown in 3D. Smooth Criminal had a video shot of Michael Jackson inserted into a Humphrey Bogart movie. On top of that were the pyrotechnics which had running fires and fireworks going off in the air over the stage. For purposes of the documentary, though, the focus is mainly on the performances, and besides Michael we get a look at the surrounding crew, and the true standout is Orianthi Panagaris who we see play guitar most notably on Black and White and Beat It. As a shredder she's definitely going to be someone to watch in the future.But for all the praise that this doc deserves, it feels like it's missing something. Anytime we see Jackson on stage we hope to see him driving at 100%. Don't get me wrong, he sounds as good as he ever has, and even better at times, and he in no way looks or acts sick. But since he's taking in everything around him and still working on getting into shape to take on the full load of 50 shows, he's not exerting himself on the choreography to the point to where he really looks like it's flowing naturally, and seems somewhat lethargic when dancing and moving around stage. Also seeing bits and pieces of the finished project and never all at once as it would have been seen in the final show, this movie, for better or for worse, makes you want more. This could have very easily been a teaser for the This Is It tour, and, considering this is the last time we'll see Michael, that's something of a problem.All in all, though, this is a great swan song for the King of Pop. It's a reminder that no matter what else, no matter what happened in his personal life, no matter what everyone thought of him or what public perception was, the public's eye really needed to remain focused on what mattered: the music, the performance, the genius. Whether you're a casual fan, or a die hard fan of Michael Jackson, I highly recommend you give this a try. If you were a fan, but dropped out when crap hit the fan in the 90's, you should still give it a try and put the artistry in perspective. This doc definitely doesn't disappoint!4.5/5",4,This Is It,1261267200,"12 20, 2009",2009,5021,"['March', '2009', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'announced', 'final', '10', 'show', 'concert', 'run', 'be',

1284602,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,B002R0EIVI,J. O. Booker,"[1, 1]","I review this film now with a mixture of sorrow, elation, and wishful thinking of what could have been. I can remember the press conference he gave on CNN. At the time it seemed like no big deal. ""OK,"" I thought, ""Michael's making another comeback after another long hiatus away from the spotlight."" Little did I realize that that would be the last time I'd see him alive and thinking back it's so ironic that his last concert was dubbed ""This is It!""Took me a good year to getting around to seeing it. In that time I couldn't even bring myself to hear any of his songs. Had all of his adult stuff (was too poor growing up to get any of his earlier stuff) but I don't consider myself a hardcore fan. Still, all of his songs are like a soundtrack for all my memories growing up and my nostalgia comes mainly from that, from losing an icon from my generation.Anyway, on to the review. It's incredible. To think that this guy was 50 years old, had been doing this for over 40 years, had been through all the scandals he'd been through, you wouldn't be able to tell it watching and listening to him in this well-edited film by Kenny Ortega, truly a bittersweet farewell to the gloved one. That light, soft, often fragile voice of his still sounds as sweet, as beautifully alien and innocent it ever has on all of his songs and those which he performed with his brothers, especially their hit ""I'll be there,"" where he gets carried away at the end and warns his organist (Michael Bearden) not to let him get too carried away and jeopardize his voice. This film shows how dedicated and how obsessed Michael was, often softening his reprimands by saying in his light voice ""I love you.""  There are many great numbers throughout this film but the standout is saved for last, Billy Jean. He left himself, so to speak, and danced his ass off as the performers stood and watched with their mouths open, cheering him on and clapping. It was great.Finally, there's a poignant retrospective of Michael by all the people he worked with in the film including various dancers, the musical director, former managers, etc. Say what you want about the man's personal life but there is no argument as to the fact that he is the greatest entertainer who ever lived. No one else even comes close.

1284604,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B002R0EIVI,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[141, 151]","""This Is It"" is likely one of the best concert films ever produced, and that's saying something considering that the actual concerts never happened, and the limited time available to shape the ample rehearsal footage into a polished final product.While the film includes interviews with those associated with Michael Jackson's planned London concerts, many snippets of creative discussions, and other ""behind the scenes"" activities, director Kenny Ortega wisely focuses on performance in the film.  Serving that end, ""This Is It"" is chockful of energetic, heartfelt songs, meticulously-produced dance numbers, and other incredible elements that would have been included in the concerts, including some wonderful filmed sequences (one ""co-starring"" Humphrey Bogart and Rita Hayworth).And when Ortega chooses to include footage of performances that are interrupted (usually by perfectionist Jackson) with creative banter on how this or that song should be tweaked, or how a musician should lengthen or highlight a chord or bar of music, it's all extremely fascinating.  We see from Michael Jackson's interaction with his musicians and producers that, despite his time away from the limelight, he was still sharp, engaged, and still very much touched by genius in the area of music and performance.  Oh, and he also repeatedly came off as a gentle, nice person.  And a generous one: a particularly touching scene shows Jackson urging his female back-up guitarist to step up and not be afraid to make the most of a solo moment (""this is your moment to shine!"").It's also uplifting (and even a little funny) to see Jackson not being able to resist giving full-fledged, amazing rehearsal performances despite the many times he says, ""Now I'm going to hold back a little and save my voice for the shows"".  After one such performance (Jackson singing a wonderfully re-imagined ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" with an enthusiastic but pretty outclassed duet partner), Jackson apologizes to the crew for again getting lost in the moment and not holding back. To which Ortega essentially tells him to not worry about it because, after all, how can Michael Jackson not help but be Michael Jackson?""This Is It"" will be a wonderful DVD to own (I'm sure the extra features will be amazing), but I'm glad that I made the trip to see the movie on the big screen.  If you can, see it that way first to get all the more impact from this entertaining, illuminating, and bittersweet farewell to Michael Jackson, both the musical icon and, more importantly, the man.",5,Amazing that this film was assembled in less than four months,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,2543,"['likely', 'one', 'best', 'concert', 'films', 'ever', 'produced', 'saying', 'something', 'considering', 'actual', 'concerts', 'never', 'happened', 'limited', 'time', 'available', 'shape', 'ample', 'rehearsal', 'footage', 'polished', 'final', 'product.While', 'film', 'interviews', 'associated', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'planned', 'London', 'concerts', 'many', 'snippets', 'creative', 'discussions', 'other', 'scenes', 'activities', 'director', 'Kenny', 'Ortega', 'wisely', 'performance', 'film', 'Serving', 'end', 'chockful', 'energetic', 'heartfelt', 'songs', 'meticulously-produced', 'dance', 'numbers', 'other', 'incredible', 'elements', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'concerts', 'including', 'wonderful', 'filmed', 'sequences', 'one', 'co-starring', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'Rita', 'Hayworth', '.And', 'when', 'Ortega', 'include', 'footage', 'performances', 'are', 'interrupted', 'usually', 'perfectionist', 'Jackson', 'creative', 'banter', 'how', 'song', 'should', 'be', 'tweaked', 'how', 'musician', 'should', 'lengthen', 'highlight', 'chord', 'bar', 'music', 'extremely', 'fascinating', 'see', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'interaction', 'musicians', 'producers', 'time', 'away', 'limelight', 'was', 'still', 'sharp', 'engaged', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'touched', 'genius', 'area', 'music', 'performance', 'Oh', 'also', 'repeatedly', 'came', 'off', 'gentle', 'nice', 'person', 'generous', 'one', 'particularly', 'touching', 'scene', 'shows', 'Jackson', 'urging', 'female', 'back-up', 'guitarist', 'step', 'up', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'make', 'most', 'solo', 'moment', 'moment', 'shine', '.It', 'also', 'uplifting', 'even', 'little', 'funny', 'see', 'Jackson', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'resist', 'giving', 'full-fledged', 'amazing', 'rehearsal', 'performances', 'many', 'times', 'Now', ""'m"", 'going', 'hold', 'back', 'little', 'save', 'voice', 'shows', 'one', 'such', 'performance', 'Jackson', 'singing', 'wonderfully', 're-imagined', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Loving', 'enthusiastic', 'pretty', 'outclassed', 'duet', 'partner', 'Jackson', 'crew', 'again', 'getting', 'lost', 'moment', 'not', 'holding', 'back', 'Ortega', 'essentially', 'not', 'worry', 'how', 'can', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'will', 'be', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'own', ""'m"", 'sure', 'extra', 'features', 'will', 'be', 'amazing', ""'m"", 'glad', 'made', 'trip', 'see', 'movie', 'big', 'screen', 'can', 'see', 'way', 'first', 'get', 'more', 'impact', 'entertaining', 'illuminating', 'bittersweet', 'farewell', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'musical', 'icon', 'more', 'importantly', 'man']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

1284607,AQIJ3ZEEVCIKU,B002R0EIVI,Kaio,"[9, 10]","Maybe it felt more intimate. Or maybe it was all the special features.  Whatever the case, I LOVED seeing this movie again and enjoyed it a thousand times more at home than when I saw it in the theater.  I loved it so much, I watched it 3 times over one weekend!Michael Jackson is simply the best, bar none.  But his best talent wasn't his singing, or even his dancing -- its that he was such a wonderful human being.  MJ holds a Guinness record for giving to the most charities and even left a third of his estate to charity.  No one else comes close to his generosity, and his kind and gentle spirit is evident in This Is It.It's the little things I loved seeing -- simple gestures, his reactions to something that was said, his laugh.  What a special man the world has lost.When I saw the movie in the theater, the crowd laughed in certain spots and I didn't understand why.  Maybe they were just giddy at seeing this icon.  Or maybe MJ was just misunderstood right to the end.  One moment in particular happened when Michael gave a correction to a band member on how his music should be played.  After giving the correction MJ says, ""with love; l-o-v-e""  then he looks down and shuffles his feet like a gentle child and says ""we'll get there; we'll get there....""  It's a simple moment that offers a glimpse into the soul of this special man.  An egomaniacal superstar would've gotten angry or been more intense.  But not Michael.  Everything was done with gentle love and support -- L-O-V-E.  But since we live in a world dominated by anger, the crowd laughed at MJ's comment.  They didn't know how to process seeing a gentle spirit asking for what he needs without anger, animosity or being a ruthless dictator; just love -- L-O-V-E.  And when faced with that simple, gentle leadership, all the crowd could do was laugh.  In effect, they may have missed the real essence of who MJ was and how he goes about things -- that it's possible to lead yet still be kind.  But few can grasp the power of that simplicity in this partisan world.Another favorite moment was seeing the dancers watch MJ dance and how much they appreciated it.  They cheered, jumped for joy and were in awe of this special man, decades their senior.  If it was thrilling for me just to watch, I can only imagine what it must have felt like in person.A testament to MJ's greatness is how everyone across the board would say ""It's Michael"" -- meaning, to work with him is something very special, and they felt compelled to give their absolute best for him.  From dancers to musicians to corporations wanting to lend their technology -- everyone gave their best, and then some, because ""it's Michael.""Person after person shared their own story of MJ coming to them with an idea for the show.  They were often worried and said, ""That's going to cost a lot of money and be a lot of work.  No one's ever done this before.""  Then they'd grin while recounting MJ's reply,  ""I know.  That's why we have to do it.""  And somehow, they'd find a way to give MJ what he wanted, because ""it's Michael"" and the show had to be special.  I suspect that's why MJ ran into trouble with prescription drugs, because ""it's Michael"" and everyone wanted to make him happy.  I think I would've had a hard time saying no to him too.  But it's important to remember MJ wasn't like the rest of us; he had special needs.  He was mortal, of course, but not ordinary.  I don't fault him for doing what he felt he needed to do.  But he just should have sought out better care and done things under the proper supervision.  But perhaps even MJ forgot how special he was and how much the world still needed him, and forgot to take care of himself so he could continue to go on.The special features on the blu-ray also went on to explain and show some of the costumes made for the concert, and I truly regret not being able to see MJ in full regalia.  The costumes were stunning to say the least.  One outfit had so many crystals on it they said you needed sunglasses just to work on it.  I can just imagine how MJ would have glowed onstage in that; sparkling and twinkling like the mega-star he was.  And then there was the Billie Jean outfit that had pulsing lights running from his socks, up his pants and arm, up to his iconic glove -- it most certainly would have been a jaw-dropping show stopper.  Why?  Cuz it's Michael.  Cuz he was that special. Cuz it would have been a once in a lifetime experience.I couldn't help but think that some of the blu-ray's special features should have been in the movie itself.  But Kenny Ortega made the choice to let the film be predominantly a concert movie; or a ""making of"" concert movie, so to speak.  And I understand that.  But the special features offer insight that the movie didn't.  The movie lets us be _with MJ as much as possible, while the special features let others _speak about what they thought and felt.  Combined, you get a much more complete picture of what the concert would have been and who MJ was.It's evident, to me at least, that Michael was happy in his final days.  He looked so very proud of what he accomplished and what he was about to share with his audience.  In one of the clips shot on the last rehearsal before his death, MJ had the biggest smile on his face.  He was beaming while he sang, then flashed his child-like grin as the lights were going down after finishing the number.  His heart was happy, and I was happy for him.  There's no question in my mind that he was ready to blow the world away and that This Is It would have been the most spectacular concert in history.  Michael was the King right to the end.  His talent was intact and wasn't diluted in any way; as is fitting for any true King.Here's my wish:Cirque du Soliel should make a Vegas show about MJ.  It would be jaw-dropping!  Dear Guy Lalibert&eacute;:  Please make this happen!!!!Bottom Line:  Buy this blu-ray.  You'll love it.  The interviews and background info alone make it well worth the purchase price.  You won't be disappointed.The world feels your absence, Michael.  The world still needs you and your message; even those too daft or cynical to know better.  But the magic you created and your spirit remain.  Perhaps bigger and better than ever.  And why is that?  Because ""it's Michael"" and it's all for love -- L-O-V-E.Thank you for enriching the world, Michael, even now that you're gone.",5,Enjoyed it more at home than at the Movie Theater!,1265068800,"02 2,

Human Nature was the best one!! I love the way he sang it. It was different from all his other human nature performances. He dressed very nice throughout the film. I love his ed hardy pants. this film is MUST SEE for MJ fans. This film shows what a caring, unique person he was. Not many singers out there cared about the environment and children like he did. It was like he had that heavenly presence inside of him.

1284635,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002R0EIVI,Mark Turner,"[5, 6]","I sat down to watch THIS IS IT, the concert film of Michael Jackson made of regular and dress rehearsal footage, I was skeptical. Yes, Jackson was a talented song writer and performer, but in the past year he'd achieved near sainthood from his fans. It was as if all the accusations concerning him had been pushed aside and forgotten.I don't know if any of them were true. I don't know if people were paid off. For all any of us know, save for those directly involved, nothing ever happened. By the same token, knowing of all of these items, you have to reflect on them. And all of that comes rushing in while watching this film though indirectly.While I enjoyed the music and the videos released over the years by Michael Jackson, I was never one of those die hard fans. I didn't rush out to buy each new CD or DVD. I never sat glued to the TV set when word leaked about a new video being released. All that changed after watching this release.So what IS the film all about? Is it simply a concert on film? It's more than that. What we have here is a glimpse behind the scenes in snippets that culminate in a concert film. The movie shows hiring dancers for the show, has interviews with everyone from these dancers to the musicians and shows us Jackson in the midst of trying to make an experience for his fans to enjoy.Had this show gone on to be performed, it would have been a spectacle to behold. Not an over the top one, but a total package of entertainment that combined dance, vocals and music unlike most concerts ever performed. The stage is there to be seen, the movements watched and the music floating from the speakers to immerse you in the experience that would have been.Beginning with ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"", the pulsing sound of the bass and drums kicks into full gear providing a beat that I challenge anyone not to start toe tapping to. Jackson does the usual animated moves he was known for, the somewhat herky jerky motions and glides across the floor that he created and a generation followed and copied. And while these moves seem a bit repetitive at times, to see a talent like Jackson who can make it seem to fluid, so easy, is a sight to behold. Had he chosen to do so, you wonder if he could have been the next major musical film star ala Gene Kelly.The songs that follow are combined with the interview footage shot during the rehearsals. We get a glimpse of Jackson working with the musicians to get the tempos correct, the sound right and the music just the way he wanted it to be when he would perform. All the while he seems calm and cordial, thanking each person as they go, offering a ""God bless you"" here and there and commenting more than once ""This is why we rehearse.""Songs included in this showcase include ""They Don't Really Care About Us"", ""Smooth Criminal"", ""The Way You Make Me Feel."", Jackson Five songs like ""I Want You Back"", ""The Love You Save"", and ""I'll Be There"". Also featured are ""Thriller"" (no way could this have been left out), ""Black or White"", ""Man In The Mirror"" and more.Along with the concert footage is some of the film pieces that were to have played in the background on a giant screen during the show. The biggest of these pieces involve a black and white segment imposing Jackson in an old Bogart movie for ""Smooth Criminal"" and a newly formed opening featuring his dancers in complete make up for ""Thriller"" which ends with a giant spider crawling on stage from which Jackson would emerge.As I said earlier, you watch this film and are filled with a wide range of emotions. The one that surfaces at once is the feeling that Jackson is sometimes hard to look at after the changes he made to himself. But that leads to the next, a feeling of sadness seeing a man who had no chance at a normal life, who was never allowed to grow like a normal child to an adult.There is a caring side to Michael Jackson no matter how many documentaries captured the strange behaviors seen on occasion. There is a man inside the machine who could capture a crowd with ease. But most of all there is an incredible talent on view in this film that has to be seen to be believed.I sat down expecting to see another lionization of Michael Jackson, placing him on a pedestal that no mere mortal should achieve. What I ended with was the chance to see an amazing talent who passed away without a chance to continue. I was moved by this film, enjoyed it from start to finish and walked away feeling that this was a more fitting tribute to the man than the media circus that was his funeral.Looking here I noticed there were no negative reviews of this DVD. That's something quite rare for any review site. But it says a lot about this release.THIS IS IT, is not just a film that should be rented. It is one that belongs in your collection. And if you are fortunate enough to have large screen and/or surround capabilities, sit back and hold on to your hats and try not to move to the beat.",5,AN AMAZING TALENT,1264464000,"01 26,

Michael wasn't even breathing hard, but this kid next to him (in the green shirt) you all know who he is  for those who've seen the movie. Well, that kid was huffing and puffing like he just ran a hundred mile marathon. No, there was nothing wrong with Michael!Watching the movie was very emotional for all those in the theater.

MJ was using the largest 3-D screen in the world as his back drop. There was not a clunker song in the set. The musicians were incredible and so were the dancers and all the crew.The songs we've heard before; his hits. MJ doesn't like to vary too much from the album versions but the musicians are allowed to embellish it a little and the songs truly sound fresh and vigorous.MJ's moves are super natural. He was a god of entertainment, a most fully realized performer.He got down.The band rocked. He's the funk master. He's hypnotic and mesmerizing to watch...crank this up on a good sound system and be prepared to be swept away.Everybody else is just sloppy seconds. He was The Man!If all you've ever seen of MJ are his music videos then you need to see this. I'm a musician and believe it or not was never too impressed with his music videos since they have to be lip-synched and you can stop and start the filming and edit out mistakes.I truly became a fan of Michael when I saw him perform live in 2001 at the Madison Square Garden 30th anniversary of his solo career show. That was live so I could tell that he can really move like that and it's not just video magic.This show is live rehearsal and they are pretty much ready to go. They are just fine tuning so you get to see the band and MJ in excellent form.He does the robot dance, does a dance where it looks like he's driving a car.. He moves like liquid lightning.Every song was a universe on to itselfDuring the song ""Human Nature"" he does these really squirrely moves that didn't seem to make sense to me at all but then all of sudden he kicks into this high note and it all makes sense...Wow!He was on and he was ready to go but fate had other plansLike Elvis before him Michael did it his wayThe film actually shows the musicians playing behind Michael which I like so you know it's not a tape and they aren't lip-synching.Michael grew up in the day when you really had to know how to sing and play an instrument.The producers of this movie should have released the live songs from this performance on a CD. Instead they chose to rerelease the studio versions of the songs which everybody has already heard on CD.The dance routines are stunning...what an artist!You have to see it to believe itHe was truly in a different leagueYou have Michael and then there is everybody elseWe love you MJ.",5,Fortunate to Have...Powerful!,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,2599,"[""'re"", 'so', 'lucky', 'someone', 'had', 'foresight', 'tape', 'rehearsals', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'nothing.The', 'sound', 'terrific', 'stage', 'second', 'only', 'size', 'scope', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'stadium', 'sets.This', 'was', 'truly', 'ambitious', 'undertaking', 'MJ', 'was', 'using', 'largest', '3-D', 'screen', 'world', 'back', 'drop', 'was', 'not', 'clunker', 'song', 'set', 'musicians', 'were', 'incredible', 'so', 'were', 'dancers', 'crew.The', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'hits', 'MJ', ""n't"", 'like', 'vary', 'too', 'much', 'album', 'versions', 'musicians', 'are', 'allowed', 'embellish', 'little', 'songs', 'truly', 'sound', 'fresh', 'vigorous.MJ', 'moves', 'are', 'super', 'natural', 'was', 'god', 'entertainment', 'most', 'fully', 'realized', 'performer.He', 'got', 'down.The', 'band', 'rocked', 'funk', 'master', 'hypnotic', 'mesmerizing', 'watch', 'crank', 'up', 'good', 'sound', 'system', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'swept', 'away.Everybody', 'else', 'just', 'sloppy', 'seconds', 'was', 'Man', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'MJ', 'are', 'music', 'videos', 'then', 'need', 'see', ""'m"", 'musician', 'believe', 'not', 'was', 'never', 'too', 'impressed', 'music', 'videos', 'have', 'be', 'lip-synched', 'can', 'stop', 'start', 'filming', 'edit', 'out', 'mistakes.I', 'truly', 'became', 'fan', 'Michael', 'when', 'saw', 'perform', 'live', '2001', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', '30th', 'anniversary', 'solo', 'career', 'show', 'was', 'live', 'so', 'could', 'tell', 'can', 'really', 'move', 'not', 'just', 'video', 'magic.This', 'show', 'live', 'rehearsal', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'ready', 'go', 'are', 'just', 'fine', 'tuning', 'so', 'get', 'see', 'band', 'MJ', 'excellent', 'form.He', 'robot', 'dance', 'dance', 'where', 'driving', 'car..', 'liquid', 'lightning.Every', 'song', 'was', 'universe', 'itselfDuring', 'song', 'Human', 'Nature', 'really', 'squirrely', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'sense', 'then', 'sudden', 'high', 'note', 'sense', 'Wow', 'was', 'was', 'ready', 'go', 'fate', 'had', 'other', 'plansLike', 'Elvis', 'Michael', 'did', 'wayThe', 'film', 'actually', 'musicians', 'playing', 'Michael', 'like', 'so', 'know', 'not', 'tape', 'are', ""n't"", 'lip-synching.Michael', 'grew', 'up', 'day', 'when', 'really', 'had', 'know', 'how', 'sing', 'play', 'instrument.The', 'producers', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'released', 'live', 'songs', 'performance', 'CD', 'Instead', 'chose', 'rerelease', 'studio', 'versions', 'songs', 'everybody', 'already', 'heard', 'CD.The', 'dance', 'routines', 'are', 'stunning', 'what', 'artist', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'itHe', 'was', 'truly', 'different', 'leagueYou', 'have', 'Michael', 'then', 'everybody', 'elseWe', 'MJ']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

It's pretty much wall to wall music but it's also a look at the behind the scene, creative genius of the man himself.  That's a glimpse of MJ that is rarely seen by the public.  The voice is still there, the dance moves have not faded.  What you also see is MJ's gentle nature and love for his fans.  He wanted the fans to hear what they remembered.  He would gently correct the band if one note was missing by saying, ""I know my music.""  He was not harsh but did demand perfection because he was a perfectionist.

He accused his label Sony and executive Tommy Mattola of racism, after failing to fairly promote his final album Invincible back in 2001, which was his lowest-selling on the label only striking double platinum. He was also tested, accused of child molestation from a targeted sting, which lead to a 2005 trial that he would be later cleared from all charges, and his private affairs financially from being in debt and his personal life were made in public in a heartbreaking manor. Yet, he was in desperate need of aid. He was set to go back to the stage for one last time in London for what was suppose to be his final tour called, This Is It. While the tour didn't happen because of his death, a movie that was around the tour came around due to the demands of his music selling again, and people pondering on what could've been from the departed King Of Pop.Michael Jackson's This Is It which wasn't suppose to be released this way, but released because of the buying from Sony for $60 Million, focused on how hard Michael Jackson was making the attempt to comeback to the music industry, after years of public targeting that affected his career. The documentary focused on the special effects strongly from mini-movies he was making which centered around his songs from Thriller and the somber Earth Song, all the way to going back to basics with simple standard performances from his biggest hits including Man In The Mirror and Billie Jean. It was so amazing how much he wanted to make that try at the brass ring which didn't happen in the tragic way it could've. Michael's vocals also seemed a bit rusty in the film, and not up to the kind of razzle-dazzle he had from before, largely due to the absence from singing and touring for a longtime, and his body looked really fraille from the abuse he had gone thorugh. Yet, he was trying to build it up all over again very steadily, but it didn't happen to be that way from what could've been that July at the O2 Arena in London.All in all, I honestly found it very difficult to watch This Is It, even one year after he sadly lost his life in the uproar that it caused that June 25th. Still, it is a delightful treat for hard core fans of Michael Jackson from start to finish. This Is It is a gripping glimpse of what made Michael Jackson a perfectionist at making what was suppose to be his last shows so strong. Kenny Ortega did a enduring and tough job, at putting the pieces of this film together, and through it all remains a great buy for King Of Pop fans young and old.Story: B-Extras: BPrice: BOverall: B 1/2-",4,The Comeback The King Of Pop Missed,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,2747,"['2000', 'decade', 'proved', 'be', 'very', 'harsh', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'bad', 'press', 'start', 'finish', 'very', 'end', 'life', 'June', '25th', '2009', 'accused', 'label', 'Sony', 'executive', 'Tommy', 'Mattola', 'racism', 'failing', 'fairly', 'promote', 'final', 'album', 'Invincible', 'back', '2001', 'was', 'lowest-selling', 'label', 'only', 'striking', 'double', 'platinum', 'was', 'also', 'tested', 'accused', 'child', 'molestation', 'targeted', 'sting', 'lead', '2005', 'trial', 'would', 'be', 'later', 'cleared', 'charges', 'private', 'affairs', 'financially', 'being', 'debt', 'personal', 'life', 'were', 'made', 'public', 'heartbreaking', 'manor', 'was', 'desperate', 'need', 'aid', 'was', 'set', 'go', 'back', 'stage', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'London', 'what', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'final', 'tour', 'called', 'tour', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'death', 'movie', 'was', 'tour', 'came', 'around', 'due', 'demands', 'music', 'selling', 'again', 'people', 'pondering', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'departed', 'King', 'Pop.Michael', 'Jackson', 'was', ""n't"", 'suppose', 'be', 'released', 'way', 'released', 'buying', 'Sony', '60', 'Million', 'focused', 'how', 'hard', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'was', 'making', 'attempt', 'comeback', 'music', 'industry', 'years', 'public', 'targeting', 'affected', 'career', 'documentary', 'focused', 'special', 'effects', 'strongly', 'mini-movies', 'was', 'making', 'centered', 'songs', 'Thriller', 'somber', 'Earth', 'Song', 'way', 'going', 'back', 'basics', 'simple', 'standard', 'performances', 'biggest', 'hits', 'including', 'Man', 'Mirror', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'was', 'so', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'wanted', 'make', 'try', 'brass', 'ring', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'tragic', 'way', 'could', ""'ve"", 'Michael', 'vocals', 'also', 'seemed', 'bit', 'rusty', 'film', 'not', 'kind', 'razzle-dazzle', 'had', 'largely', 'due', 'absence', 'singing', 'touring', 'longtime', 'body', 'looked', 'really', 'fraille', 'abuse', 'had', 'gone', 'thorugh', 'was', 'trying', 'build', 'up', 'over', 'again', 'very', 'steadily', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'be', 'way', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'July', 'O2', 'Arena', 'London.All', 'honestly', 'found', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'even', 'one', 'year', 'sadly', 'lost', 'life', 'uproar', 'caused', 'June', '25th', 'Still', 'delightful', 'treat', 'hard', 'core', 'fans', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'start', 'finish', 'gripping', 'glimpse', 'what', 'made', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'perfectionist', 'making', 'what', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'last', 'shows', 'so', 'strong', 'Kenny', 'Ortega', 'did', 'enduring', 'tough', 'job', 'putting', 'pieces', 'film', 'together', 'great', 'buy', 'King', 'Pop', 'fans', 'young', 'old.Story', 'B-Extras', 'BPrice', 'BOverall', 'B', '1/2-']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

In these things, ""This Is It"" succeeds marginally, but the documentary does little to entertain.Inexplicably, ""This Is It"" begins with a brief look at dance auditions in April 2009 then skips to late in the rehearsal schedule, when there is little left to do except decamp for London and full dress rehearsals there. I'm sure that the filmmakers wanted to give viewers as much of Michael Jackson's performance as they could while sparing us tedious early rehearsals, but they might have spared us the soundbites of overwrought dancers as well. What we get is an awkward combination of sub-standard performance footage and a behind-the-scenes look into creating the film footage that was to be used on a huge 3-D LED screen behind the stage.There were to be at least four major pieces of film content for the LED screen, whose 3-D feature made it possible for characters to move from the screen to the live stage, an innovation that would have been seen for the first time onstage in London. We can't see that, but we do get much of the final film content that concertgoers would have seen. That is where ""This Is It"" excels: It gives the viewer a pretty good idea of what these concerts would have looked like. And they would have been a success. Though I'm not convinced Jackson could have done 50 shows, he clearly intended to give his fans their money's worth in glamour, pyrotechnics, dance, and multimedia.But ""This Is It"" disappoints in its footage of Michael Jackson. We see rehearsals of the major musical performances, but Jackson is saving his voice and his body for the tour. Some of his vocals seem to be dubbed in from other recordings. He goes through the dance steps to get the blocking right, but he doesn't put much energy into it. Though he is fit and prepared, he's not really giving a performance in these clips, and he says very little between sets. Because ""This Is It"" has chosen to feature Jackson's performance as much as possible, we don't get any commentary on the concert preparations. For that, watch ""Staging the Return"" and ""The Gloved One"" in the DVD bonus features, which offer additional details on the concert's artistry.The DVD (Sony 2010): ""Staging the Return"" (40 min) interviews the creative team and producers about planning and preparing for the concerts. Unlike the film, these interviews were recorded after Jackson's death, so they have more perspective. They're also a chance for these people to tell the world about all the spectacular stuff they created for the concerts that no one will ever get to see. ""The Gloved One"" (15 min) focuses on Jackson's costumes. Designer Zaldy shows us the 7 outfits he created for Jackson in some detail. In ""Memories of Michael"" (16 min), Jackson's creative and business partners share their memories of the man. ""Auditions: Searching for the World's Best Dancers"" (10 min) give us a peek at the dance auditions in Los Angeles. Subtitles for the film are available in English, English SDH, and French. The ""English"" subtitles are only of Jackson, as he tends to speak softly.

The music and dancing are great, and some of the scenes are spectacular, but you're essentially watching a rehearsal.  In several places Michael acknowledges that he's saving his voice, so the power you would see in a real show is not quite there.However, what is really compelling about this movie is the way it lets you inside Michael's world and into his heart.  You see Michael in odd moments when he is just being himself, and you see what a phenomenal person he was.  He does everything in love.  He never loses his temper.  He's down to earth and exceedingly humble.  He is always thinking about others.  Multiple times, he says, ""God bless you"" to various people.  It is the insight into Michael that I will always remember about this DVD.The special features are a treasure too.  One of them is all about the costumes that Michael would have worn had the show come about, and they are completely amazing--a show all in themselves.  Another is about memories of Michael, and there again are tender moments and little glimpses of Michael.Michael got what love is all about, and he incorporated it not only into his work but into every moment of his life.  He was a living legend and a living epitome of unconditional love.  He will always occupy a place of honor in my heart for who he was.  Michael was an extremely hard worker and a perfectionist, because he was creating a gift of love to give to his fans.  He was generous, caring, and iconic in his humanity.  My hat is off to Michael, and I'm inspired by his example of love and humility.

His last few words to the crowd: ""Spread our love to the planet"" were delivered in solemn manner that will attach to Jackson's name for long time. His instantaneous indulgence in music and dance is innate and could not easily be replicated. Jackson's comments ""let it simmer"", ""let it open quickly and close slowly and quietly"", ""it feels like a fist in the inner ears"", combined with unique richness in his voice, and physical depletion, all distinguish his mythical aura from the contrasting crowd surrounding him.The music was blessed by the Jackson's genius. Though an empire of artisans and talents thrived on Jackson's, his physical cachexia limited his mobility. With hunched back, feeble limbs, and inflexible joints, Jackson could not return his golden years of physical vigor. His seasoned spirit and mind were hindered by his neglected health. Though he was able to lead the crowd of performers, he could not hide the many brief moments of stiff gait, caved posture, and feeble reflexes.Jackson's innate sense of his role in history is manifested in his reserved comments and confidence in the mastery of his art. It is unfortunate that such unique artist has idled for a full decade in the shadows of absence, yet to return with such high spirit riding on sickened body.Judging by the quickness of his initiatives, in comparison to his companions, one could clearly notice that his leading edge in synchronizing bodily motions with music far exceeds others, though his lacks the his youthful energy. As such, I doubt if he was  able to accomplish the harsh and gruesome schedule set for his upcoming tours. There was no doubt that the cow's breasts have been milked out to the last drop. Jackson's health appeared clearly a major obstacle in his way to reach the goals set to him.

We have no idea if Michael would have endorsed Obama - and I find it disrespectful that the ad is in there in the first place.  (And it is a rather lengthy ad.)The other thing, if you are truly a fan of Michael Jackson's work - you're not going to find much good work here.  He was a perfectionist, as is obvious by all his other work... I suspect he would not have liked to have his rehearsals shown.  Rehearsal is exactly that - re herse.Having said that, I've watched it a few times.  Clearly there were those he truly loved working right along side him - and that's a lovely thing to see.  He also looks fragile and weak, disoriented at times - and like there is no way he could have withstood the pressures of the actual production had it gone that far.

1284682,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002R0EIVI,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[24, 41]","This Is It (Kenny Ortega, 2009)I think everyone knows this by now, but for the record, the footage that was compiled, edited, and released as This Is It was never meant to be seen by anyone but Michael Jackson (and, presumably, a handful of trusted advisors, as well as those working on the shows). Nothing about this is finished; this is not in any way a concert film. If you're not the kind of person who can listen to a third-generation bootleg tape and visualize the original concert, This Is It may not live up to your expectations. (This is, in fact, exactly the reaction my daughter, a Michael Jackson fanatic, had to the movie.) As a document of the creative process involved in the making of such a massive live show, however, it sheds light that very few people have seen, and in that way, it is quite valuable.One does not put together a cast-of-hundreds live performance at the drop of a hat and simply allow everyone to do what they want. Michael Jackson has to ride herd on an incredible number of artists here, including a few full complements of dancers, a large number of musicians, a gaggle of lighting and video techs, and all the other people involved in order to pull something like this together. And while some of the management methods may seem a little on the odd side, whatever the man did, it held him in good stead for quite a number of years and quite a number of huge performances; from the looks of things here, it was going to work again. We only get to see, in many cases, the barest outlines of what would have been. In some cases, not even that. (The whole girls-in-cages thing, for example, gets a few mentions, and we see some early cage prototypes, but nothing of the actual routine.) In other instances, the routine is almost completely worked out, and we see, sans lights, big explosion effects, and most of Jackson's vocals (it's mentioned by a few people that he's preserving his voice), the finished product (""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" and ""Beat It"" being the two that seemed closest to done to me). Throughout it all, Jackson stops the action once in a while to tweak something, however small it may be. Control freak? Perhaps, but there are quite literally thousands of little details, and every last one of them has to be worked out, especially in songs with video accompaniment (""Thriller"" and ""Smooth Criminal"", for example); everyone's got to do everything right when it's supposed to be done. You can't pull that off without some control freak in you, I don't think.It's not bad, but more than anything it's frustrating, seeing what might have been (and I say this as someone who's never been all that big a Michael Jackson fan). And, like most concerts, I found myself wondering why some songs had been included and others (""Rock with You"", ""Off the Wall"", ""P.Y.T."", all number one hits) had been left off the list. But what's here is kind of fun to watch. Instructional as well, not that any of us would ever be putting a show this big together, but you can always dream. ** ",3,"This is, in fact, it.",1260489600,"12 11, 2009",2009,3030,"['Kenny', 'Ortega', '2009', 'think', 'everyone', 'now', 'record', 'footage', 'was', 'compiled', 'edited', 'released', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'anyone', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'presumably', 'handful', 'trusted', 'advisors', 'as', 'well', 'working', 'shows', 'Nothing', 'finished', 'not', 'way', 'concert', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'listen', 'third-generation', 'bootleg', 'tape', 'visualize', 'original', 'concert', 'may', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'fact', 'exactly', 'reaction', 'daughter', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'fanatic', 'had', 'movie', 'document', 'creative', 'process', 'involved', 'making', 'such', 'massive', 'live', 'show', 'however', 'light', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'way', 'quite', 'valuable.One', 'not', 'put', 'together', 'cast-of-hundreds', 'live', 'performance', 'drop', 'hat', 'simply', 'allow', 'everyone', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'ride', 'herd', 'incredible', 'number', 'artists', 'here', 'including', 'few', 'full', 'complements', 'dancers', 'large', 'number', 'musicians', 'gaggle', 'lighting', 'video', 'techs', 'other', 'people', 'involved', 'order', 'pull', 'something', 'together', 'management', 'methods', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'odd', 'side', 'man', 'did', 'held', 'good', 'stead', 'quite', 'number', 'years', 'quite', 'number', 'huge', 'performances', 'looks', 'things', 'here', 'was', 'going', 'work', 'again', 'only', 'get', 'see', 'many', 'cases', 'barest', 'outlines', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cases', 'not', 'even', 'whole', 'girls-in-cages', 'thing', 'example', 'few', 'mentions', 'see', 'early', 'cage', 'prototypes', 'nothing', 'actual', 'routine', 'other', 'instances', 'routine', 'almost', 'completely', 'worked', 'out', 'see', 'sans', 'lights', 'big', 'explosion', 'effects', 'most', 'Jackson', 'vocals', 'mentioned', 'few', 'people', 'preserving', 'voice', 'finished', 'product', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'Startin', 'Somethin', 'Beat', 'being', 'two', 'seemed', 'closest', 'done', 'Jackson', 'action', 'once', 'while', 'tweak', 'something', 'however', 'small', 'may', 'be', 'Control', 'freak', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'quite', 'literally', 'thousands', 'little', 'details', 'last', 'one', 'be', 'worked', 'out', 'especially', 'songs', 'video', 'accompaniment', 'Thriller', 'Smooth', 'Criminal', 'example', 'everyone', 'got', 'do', 'everything', 'right', 'when', 'supposed', 'be', 'done', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off', 'control', 'freak', 'do', ""n't"", 'think.It', 'not', 'bad', 'more', 'anything', 'frustrating', 'seeing', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'big', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'fan', 'most', 'concerts', 'found', 'wondering', 'why', 'songs', 'had', 'been', 'included', 'others', 'Rock', 'Wall', 'P.Y.T', 'number', 'one', 'hits', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'off', 'list', 'what', 'here', 'kind', 'fun', 'watch', 'Instructional', 'well', 'not', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'putting', 'show', 'big', 'together', 'can', 'always', 'dream', '**']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

Michael is no prima donna by any means, and he appears like someone you could easily talk to as a friend if you are friends with him. His talent is second nature to him like breathing and eating, all he has to do is to present it in perfected mode for a dynamite act that will wow em in the audience.The advantage here, although I wish he could have completed his tour as scheduled, is we as an audience not only get to see the rehearsals for his dynamite swan song concert, but the vibrations and chemistry of the inside look towards his backups, dancers, and studio technicians which might have been completely overlooked in the main event. What is the validity to this? Michael himself that this quote unquote ""This Is It"" mission is the final hour for his days of touring shows. On the brief other hand, we have aspiring new talent who have emulated Michael all their lives, and now have a chance to glow beside him. This is their hour as well, to glow on stage next to the master. It is this factor that makes this video a class all its own outside of another dress rehearsal of a major pop star. If you could eclipse the events that led to his accidental death just for a moment, we see the mega talent of yesterday colliding with the new world of today. Michael himself said his songs were possibly outdated since they are almost entirely devoid of any kind of rap labels of today. This should not concern him, however, since even the most rap star bros cannot do anything but see Michael as the ongoing mega star he is, and you can tell quite plainly by their reverence in talking to him while rehearsing through the numbers one at a time.Excellent documentary video, and probably a better concert with vast chemistry other than a dynamic performance by all, and the technicians left in the dark.",5,This was it for the king of pop,1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,1946,"['Michael', 'career', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'as', 'long', 'one', 'iota', 'person', 'who', 'still', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'human', 'being', 'Michael', 'prima', 'donna', 'means', 'someone', 'could', 'easily', 'talk', 'friend', 'are', 'friends', 'talent', 'second', 'nature', 'breathing', 'eating', 'do', 'present', 'perfected', 'mode', 'dynamite', 'act', 'will', 'wow', 'em', 'audience.The', 'advantage', 'here', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'completed', 'tour', 'scheduled', 'audience', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'see', 'rehearsals', 'dynamite', 'swan', 'song', 'concert', 'vibrations', 'chemistry', 'inside', 'look', 'backups', 'dancers', 'studio', 'technicians', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'overlooked', 'main', 'event', 'What', 'validity', 'Michael', 'quote', 'unquote', 'mission', 'final', 'hour', 'days', 'touring', 'shows', 'brief', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'aspiring', 'new', 'talent', 'who', 'have', 'emulated', 'Michael', 'lives', 'now', 'have', 'chance', 'glow', 'beside', 'hour', 'well', 'glow', 'stage', 'next', 'master', 'factor', 'video', 'class', 'own', 'outside', 'dress', 'rehearsal', 'major', 'pop', 'star', 'could', 'eclipse', 'events', 'led', 'accidental', 'death', 'just', 'moment', 'see', 'mega', 'talent', 'yesterday', 'colliding', 'new', 'world', 'today', 'Michael', 'said', 'songs', 'were', 'possibly', 'outdated', 'are', 'almost', 'entirely', 'devoid', 'kind', 'rap', 'labels', 'today', 'should', 'not', 'concern', 'however', 'even', 'most', 'rap', 'star', 'bros', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'see', 'Michael', 'ongoing', 'mega', 'star', 'can', 'tell', 'quite', 'plainly', 'reverence', 'talking', 'rehearsing', 'numbers', 'one', 'time.Excellent', 'documentary', 'video', 'probably', 'better', 'concert', 'vast', 'chemistry', 'other', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'technicians', 'left', 'dark']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

1284687,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002R0EIVI,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","In a way, Kenny Ortega`s ""Michael Jackson's This is It"" is more interesting for what it ISN'T than for what it is.  What it ISN'T is a documentary account of the life, career and death of Mr. Jackson, inevitably colored by the personal viewpoints and biases of its maker.  In fact, but for the cruel hand of Fate, ""This is It"" shouldn't even exist as a movie at all.  The behind-the-scenes footage of Jackson and his crew mounting their elaborate, effects-laden worldwide tour scheduled for summer 2009 - his first in over ten years - was initially intended only for Jackson`s own personal library.  Instead, that footage has become a moving elegy for the self-proclaimed King of Pop, who died tragically on June 25, 2009, at the unripe young age of 50.  Wisely, there are no post-mortem interviews or commentary included in the film.  The performers all speak of him in the present tense, excited at the prospect of being a part of what is clearly an experience of a lifetime for any musician, dancer or singer fortunate enough to be a part of the show.  That their dreams never really came to fruition is what gives the film a depth and poignancy that goes beyond simply the loss of Jackson.  Indeed, watching this film is a bit like experiencing how the gods must feel, looking down upon us mere mortals as we go about our daily lives secure in the nave belief that we will live forever, blithely unaware of what the future actually has in store for us.As to Jackson himself, he emerges as energetic and deeply engaged in the creative process, no more petulant or demanding than your average legendary superstar - one who actually had talent, by the way, celebrated for his songwriting and choreography as well as for his singing and dancing.  And, of course, the music itself is irresistible and timeless.It's a bittersweet experience watching this film, not only because of what happened to Michael but because of all the time and energy displayed by these hardworking individuals that would eventually come to naught.  The small compensation is the existence of this film that captures not just for us but for generations yet unborn the creative and performing genius of Michael that will endure through time.Who knows, but someday someone will make a warts-and-all biography of Michael Jackson that will attempt to knock the king off his throne.

The simplicity of how this particular song was supposed to work is perhaps the most deeply affecting moment of the filmThe bombast is handled with edge and precision on other selections, though. ""Earth Song"" mixes an impressive short film with on-stage spectacle, and ""They Don't Care About Us"" hits like a ton of bricks with Jackson's powerhouse vocals (lip-synced though they may be, this was a rehearsal), universal lyrics and dazzling body control as he adheres to the challenging choreography.Some of the most rewarding moments come where they are least expected, such as when Michael and a sound technician lightly bicker over specificities of a track playback. It's particularly cute - not to mention entertaining and moving - to see Michael serenade the lucky young woman to sing the female part on ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You."" Toward the conclusion of the song Jackson reaches for some high notes, leaving the young singer staring at him in admiration. He kindly reminds her with a gesture of his arm that the audience will be in front of the stage; she had better face them, not him.The professionalism of all involved is consummate and beyond reproach. The utter investment and enthusiasm exuded by the dynamic back-up dancers, musicians and crew, including director Kenny Ortega, are as befitting of a Michael Jackson project as could be imagined. Their blood, sweat and tears all dripped into this show and ""This Is It"" makes this abundantly clear, and the unbridled joy they shared sculpting this project is endlessly palpable.Those looking for a full-on Michael Jackson concert will be better served by purchasing a Hi-Def TV with booming surround sound and slipping in the ""Dangerous: Live in Bucharest"" DVD. ""This Is It"" does not suit this purpose but is rather a unique, (semi)-unfiltered snapshot of the greatest concert that might have been, starring the greatest entertainer of his generation, if not all time. In that light it is certainly a film that is one of a kind, not to mention one that will be viewed with fascination for generations to come.Could Michael have pulled off performing this show 50 times in London's 02? We'll never know, but ""This Is It"" ably demonstrates that if he had the results would have been eye-popping, sweet on the ears and downright startling - an overwhelming combination of sights and sounds to blow the minds of millions. For a man who set the bar so startlingly high a title like the King of Pop is only getting started.",5,Genius at Work!,1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,3238,"['Sometimes', 'hype', 'way', 'letting', 'really', 'see', 'things', 'what', 'are', 'A', 'few', 'minutes', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'not', 'apply', 'here.No', 'question', 'Michael', 'back', 'two', 'hours', 'footage', 'are', 'part', 'parcel', 'rehearsals', 'filming', 'non-deliberate', 'unexacting', 'However', 'truths', 'serve', 'make', 'more', 'affecting', 'reading', 'diary', 'entry', 'see', 'Michael', 'rehearsal', 'see', 'totally', 'unscripted', 'in-the-moment', 'consummate', 'professional', 'even', 'spite', 'arena', 'full', 'empty', 'seats', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'stark', 'lovely', 'Michael', 'taking', 'center', 'stage', 'help', 'dancers', 'back-up', 'vocalists', 'strutting', 'spinning', 'days', 'old', 'simplicity', 'how', 'particular', 'song', 'was', 'supposed', 'work', 'perhaps', 'most', 'deeply', 'affecting', 'moment', 'filmThe', 'bombast', 'handled', 'edge', 'precision', 'other', 'selections', 'though', 'Earth', 'Song', 'mixes', 'impressive', 'short', 'film', 'on-stage', 'spectacle', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Care', 'Us', 'ton', 'bricks', 'Jackson', 'powerhouse', 'vocals', 'lip-synced', 'may', 'be', 'was', 'rehearsal', 'universal', 'lyrics', 'dazzling', 'body', 'control', 'challenging', 'choreography.Some', 'most', 'rewarding', 'moments', 'come', 'where', 'are', 'least', 'expected', 'such', 'when', 'Michael', 'sound', 'technician', 'lightly', 'bicker', 'specificities', 'track', 'playback', 'particularly', 'cute', 'not', 'mention', 'entertaining', 'moving', 'see', 'Michael', 'serenade', 'lucky', 'young', 'woman', 'sing', 'female', 'part', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Loving', 'conclusion', 'song', 'Jackson', 'high', 'notes', 'leaving', 'young', 'singer', 'staring', 'admiration', 'kindly', 'gesture', 'arm', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'front', 'stage', 'had', 'better', 'face', 'not', 'him.The', 'professionalism', 'involved', 'consummate', 'reproach', 'utter', 'investment', 'enthusiasm', 'exuded', 'dynamic', 'back-up', 'dancers', 'musicians', 'crew', 'including', 'director', 'Kenny', 'Ortega', 'are', 'befitting', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'project', 'could', 'be', 'imagined', 'blood', 'sweat', 'tears', 'dripped', 'show', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'unbridled', 'joy', 'shared', 'sculpting', 'project', 'endlessly', 'palpable.Those', 'looking', 'full-on', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'concert', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'served', 'purchasing', 'Hi-Def', 'TV', 'booming', 'surround', 'sound', 'slipping', 'Dangerous', 'Live', 'Bucharest', 'DVD', 'not', 'suit', 'purpose', 'rather', 'unique', 'semi', '-unfiltered', 'snapshot', 'greatest', 'concert', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'starring', 'greatest', 'entertainer', 'generation', 'not', 'time', 'light', 'certainly', 'film', 'one', 'kind', 'not', 'mention', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'viewed', 'fascination', 'generations', 'come.Could', 'Michael', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'performing', 'show', '50', 'times', 'London', '02', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'ably', 'had', 'results', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'eye-popping', 'sweet', 'ears', 'downright', 'startling', 'overwhelming', 'combination', 'sights', 'blow', 'minds', 'millions', 'man', 'who', 'set', 'bar', 'so', 'startlingly', 'high', 'title', 'King', 'Pop', 'only', 'getting', 'started']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

1284695,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B002R0EIVI,Sean Pasek,"[13, 14]","Michael Jackson has fans all over the world.  So many people for years have endeared themselves to him.  The fans vary from young to old.  There are young kids today who are just beginning to become familiar with his music.  This film may help many to understand, at an even deeper level, why he's the iconic pop star whom many love and adore.However, if anything can be said about Michael Jackson, it is that he transcended his music.  Oh, there is no doubt that he was a master entertainer, dancer, and composer of some of the most incredible songs written in the modern era.  Despite being all of these things, what is most amazing and enduring, is the man himself.  And ""This Is It"" gives us an incredible glimpse into who Michael Jackson really was.Michael Jackson has often been described as a quiet, loving man who loved the planet and all those around him.  Some people, I'm sure, have scoffed at this notion.  Watch ""This Is It,"" and you just might change your perception.I find it almost haunting and a bit of foreshadowing, when during a press conference, Michael tells everyone, ""This is my final curtain call.  This is it.""  On some level, I wonder if he might have known something.  Perhaps not.  Perhaps he was simply talking about his career as a performer.  However, a few people have told me that they found this statement of his a bit eerie.There is no doubt that Michael felt right at home on stage, performing for thousands of people.  He is into every facet of the show, from lighting to sound to choreography, to musical play.  This is a true artist at work; an artist who is, without question, a master of his craft.  Like watching a composer, Michael orchestrates everything.  He knows when something isn't quite right, and there were a number of times during this film where he tells someone, ""That isn't quite right.""  I have a musical ear, but definitely not like Michael's, because half the time, I couldn't tell what was wrong.  But it doesn't matter what I think. He's the artist, and it's so much fun to watch this master artist at work.It seemed that every time there was music playing, whether it was someone practicing on their keyboard or guitar, Michael's body immediately sprang into a series of dance movements.  Music was life to him.  It was like someone flipped a switch, and he would begin moving, even if it was just tapping his leg.I think one aspect of Michael's character that was shown, was that he never got angry with anyone.  He never got upset or even so much as raised his voice at someone.  Instead we hear nothing but encouraging words, ""God bless you,"" he often said.  ""Don't worry, we'll get there.""  ""This is why we rehearse.  It will all work.""  I can see why people loved working for the man.  He was a perfectionist, to be sure, but then what artist isn't?  But instead of losing his cool or getting upset, he instead worked with everyone.  In many ways, this aspect really offered insight into the type of man that Michael Jackson was, a man who loved people and tried to always treat them with the utmost level of respect.The film also offers insight into Michael's music.  I can't think of many other pop stars who have written such a body of work that actually has something to say.  Michael wanted his music to have more than a pleasurable impact.  He wanted people to think about the planet, other people, and ultimately, themselves.  I found it interesting that during his concert tours, he often ended his concerts with his most powerful songs...""Heal the World,"" and ""Man in the Mirror.""Add to these two songs another provocative piece, ""Earth Song.""  There is a segment in this film where Michael has some new video footage to add to the piece.  I won't disclose the details here, for anyone who has not yet seen this film, because I feel it's important to experience it without knowing about it.  However, if this segment does not touch your heart, give you chills, and get your eyes watering, then perhaps you'd better check your pulse!For many reasons, Michael Jackson will never be gone to us.  I'll lay odds that people will still be listening to his music 100 years from now, just as people still listen to Mozart or Bach or Beethoven, and they will wonder who this person is.  Those who really have some insight into the man that Michael Jackson was, will be able to tell others that Michael Jackson was a man who loved music, loved the planet, and loved people.This isn't it, Michael, it's just the beginning!",5,"The King Lives, and He Always Will",1258070400,"11 13, 2009",2009,4488,"['Michael', 'Jackson', 'fans', 'world', 'So', 'many', 'people', 'years', 'have', 'endeared', 'fans', 'vary', 'young', 'old', 'are', 'young', 'kids', 'today', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'beginning', 'become', 'familiar', 'music', 'film', 'may', 'help', 'many', 'understand', 'even', 'deeper', 'level', 'why', 'iconic', 'pop', 'star', 'whom', 'many', 'love', 'adore.However', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'transcended', 'music', 'Oh', 'doubt', 'was', 'master', 'entertainer', 'dancer', 'composer', 'most', 'incredible', 'songs', 'written', 'modern', 'era', 'being', 'things', 'what', 'most', 'amazing', 'enduring', 'man', 'incredible', 'glimpse', 'who', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'really', 'Jackson', 'often', 'been', 'described', 'quiet', 'loving', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'planet', 'people', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'scoffed', 'notion', 'Watch', 'just', 'might', 'change', 'perception.I', 'find', 'almost', 'haunting', 'bit', 'foreshadowing', 'when', 'press', 'conference', 'Michael', 'everyone', 'final', 'curtain', 'call', 'level', 'wonder', 'might', 'have', 'known', 'something', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'simply', 'talking', 'career', 'performer', 'However', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'told', 'found', 'statement', 'bit', 'doubt', 'Michael', 'felt', 'right', 'home', 'stage', 'performing', 'thousands', 'people', 'facet', 'show', 'lighting', 'sound', 'choreography', 'musical', 'play', 'true', 'artist', 'work', 'artist', 'who', 'question', 'master', 'craft', 'watching', 'composer', 'Michael', 'everything', 'when', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'were', 'number', 'times', 'film', 'where', 'someone', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'have', 'musical', 'ear', 'definitely', 'not', 'Michael', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'think', 'artist', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'master', 'artist', 'work.It', 'seemed', 'time', 'was', 'music', 'playing', 'was', 'someone', 'practicing', 'keyboard', 'guitar', 'Michael', 'body', 'immediately', 'sprang', 'series', 'dance', 'movements', 'Music', 'was', 'life', 'was', 'someone', 'flipped', 'switch', 'would', 'begin', 'moving', 'even', 'was', 'just', 'tapping', 'leg.I', 'think', 'one', 'aspect', 'Michael', 'character', 'was', 'shown', 'was', 'never', 'got', 'angry', 'anyone', 'never', 'got', 'upset', 'even', 'so', 'much', 'raised', 'voice', 'someone', 'Instead', 'hear', 'nothing', 'encouraging', 'words', 'God', 'bless', 'often', 'said', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'ll"", 'get', 'there', 'why', 'rehearse', 'will', 'work', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'loved', 'working', 'man', 'was', 'perfectionist', 'be', 'sure', 'then', 'what', 'artist', ""n't"", 'instead', 'losing', 'cool', 'getting', 'upset', 'instead', 'worked', 'everyone', 'many', 'ways', 'aspect', 'really', 'offered', 'insight', 'type', 'man', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'people', 'tried', 'always', 'treat', 'utmost', 'level', 'respect.The', 'film', 'also', 'insight', 'Michael', 'music', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'other', 'pop', 'stars', 'who', 'have', 'written', 'body', 'work', 'actually', 'something', 'say', 'Michael', 'wanted', 'music', 'have', 'more', 'pleasurable', 'impact', 'wanted', 'people', 'think', 'planet', 'other', 'people', 'ultimately', 'found', 'interesting', 'concert', 'tours', 'often', 'ended', 'concerts', 'most', 'powerful', 'songs', 'Heal', 'World', 'Man', 'Mirror', 'Add', 'two', 'songs', 'provocative', 'piece', 'Earth', 'Song', 'segment', 'film', 'where', 'Michael', 'new', 'video', 'footage', 'add', 'piece', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disclose', 'details', 'here', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'film', 'feel', 'important', 'experience', 'knowing', 'However', 'segment', 'not', 'touch', 'heart', 'give', 'chills', 'get', 'eyes', 'watering', 'then', 'perhaps', ""'d"", 'better', 'check', 'pulse', 'many', 'reasons', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'gone', ""'ll"", 'lay', 'odds', 'people', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'listening', 'music', '100', 'years', 'now', 'just', 'people', 'still', 'listen', 'Mozart', 'Bach', 'Beethoven', 'will', 'wonder', 'who', 'person', 'who', 'really', 'have', 'insight', 'man', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'was', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'others', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'music', 'loved', 'planet', 'loved', 'people.This', ""n't"", 'Michael', 'just', 'beginning']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

1284698,A6UGTB17P5BX8,B002R0EIVI,Simon Gifford,"[3, 4]","I really enjoyed this. I was surprised by how Michael Jackson danced and moved well, very impressive - for a 50 year old guy remember - and looked healthy which makes it even sadder he passed away.He sure didn't look like a guy who was ""frail"" or ill (as some UK media described him) or that his heart wasn't in it. In fact he looked better than he had for some years.Some productions look as if they could have been crackers - for the example the 'Smooth Criminal' sequence was brilliant, with some very clever splicing putting MJ in a 40's gangster film (Rita Hayworth's 1946 film 'Gilda'), an updated 'Thriller' video and the moving 'Earth Song'. Also there were some good rehersal performances of 'Billie Jean', 'Beat It' etc. He also seemed clued up enough and knew what he was doing to direct his dancers and keep rhythm. I also read some reports or rumours that a double was used for some sequences but I didn't spot any, if one was used I can't see the join!It's an enjoyable yet frustrating (in the sense of ""What if?"") look at what his shows could have been like. It was interesting getting an insight into the production/videos. I'm sure the live shows would have been incredible!In a curious way, this is one of the best and worst things. In presenting the MJ the fans/public want to see (understandably), it makes you think you never thought he'd die, but now he's gone - if that makes sense. In a sense, maybe the film fools us in the way Michael often fooled us.But I think it was supposed to be celebrate him, and this is surely a must for fans to remember him by.At the end, the audience in the cinema even applauded which isnt something you see very often.I'm not even that big an MJ fan but can appreciate he was a pop legend and I enjoyed some of his music, he has made some very good music.It would have been such a spectacle to see him in London.",4,A taste of what might have been....

1284700,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B002R0EIVI,Sky,"[3, 3]","I've probably written two-dozen reviews of music DVDs here on Amazon, and of all the music DVDs that I've seen, none were really like Michael Jackson's This Is It. The major difference between This Is It and the other music DVDs that I've seen is that the others are all live concerts; This Is It is footage of rehearsals and preparation for the tour that Jackson was to perform starting in July 2009...which of course never got started due to his untimely and quite tragic death.Odd as Michael was (and looked), he truly was a musical genius....So many great songs over a span of half a century. And over the past 25 years Michael's life became part of pop culture and he was a captive to whatever the tabloids wanted to portray the guy as at any given time. What this film does is give you the opportunity to see Michael Jackson the performer and also a first hand look at the man behind the performer. And it turns out that two things are indeed confirmed: he was a musical genius and he was eccentrically odd.To set the record straight, this impromptu documentary/concert DVD was never meant to be; the cameras and crew were apparently on set rehearsing themselves for filming of the first few actual shows. So what you ultimately get are very real and unrehearsed rehearsal sessions. And I gotta say, I wish that all of the music DVDs that I own or have watched included a behind the scenes rehearsal session. It's a very cool perspective to watch from. You not only get full or close to full performances of most of the songs, you see the real prep work that goes into performing each song and you get a glimpse at the personalities and camaraderie of the band, the performers/dancers and of course MJ.The film's director Kenny Ortega is probably best known for theHigh School Musicalmovies. Kenny comes across like Michael's therapist. You know that guy Ben Stein with the monotone delivery? Ortega has the same droning voice and throughout This Is It Ortega can be heard comically talking like a child therapist to Michael as if to prevent him from having a tantrum. It's really amusing.But the real fun is watching Jackson perform the songs that you probably grew up with. The band is really on, and Michael at age 51 still sang like an angel when he needed to and could rock with the rest when he wanted to. There are very few low (or boring) moments on the DVD; when it was over I was looking for more. But alas there was no more; only the realization that it was really over and that The King of Pop has left fans with a nice parting gift in this DVD.Songs include:""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'""""Speechless""""Jam""""Bad""""They Don't Care About Us""""Human Nature""""Smooth Criminal""""The Way You Make Me Feel.""""I Want You Back"", ""The Love You Save"", ""I'll Be There"" and ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)"" medley""I Just Can't Stop Loving You""""Thriller""""Who Is It""""Beat It""Black or White""""Earth Song""""Billie Jean""Man in the Mirror""""This Is It""",4,Man Behind the Mirror,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,2947,"[""'ve"", 'probably', 'written', 'two-dozen', 'reviews', 'music', 'DVDs', 'here', 'Amazon', 'music', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'none', 'were', 'really', 'like', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'major', 'difference', 'other', 'music', 'DVDs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'others', 'are', 'live', 'concerts', 'footage', 'rehearsals', 'preparation', 'tour', 'Jackson', 'was', 'perform', 'starting', 'July', '2009', 'course', 'never', 'got', 'started', 'due', 'untimely', 'quite', 'tragic', 'death.Odd', 'Michael', 'was', 'looked', 'truly', 'was', 'musical', 'genius', '.So', 'many', 'great', 'songs', 'span', 'century', 'past', '25', 'years', 'Michael', 'life', 'became', 'part', 'pop', 'culture', 'was', 'captive', 'whatever', 'tabloids', 'wanted', 'portray', 'guy', 'given', 'time', 'What', 'film', 'give', 'opportunity', 'see', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'performer', 'also', 'first', 'hand', 'look', 'man', 'performer', 'out', 'two', 'things', 'are', 'indeed', 'confirmed', 'was', 'musical', 'genius', 'was', 'eccentrically', 'odd.To', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'impromptu', 'documentary/concert', 'DVD', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'cameras', 'crew', 'were', 'apparently', 'set', 'rehearsing', 'filming', 'first', 'few', 'actual', 'shows', 'So', 'what', 'ultimately', 'get', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'unrehearsed', 'rehearsal', 'sessions', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'wish', 'music', 'DVDs', 'own', 'have', 'watched', 'included', 'scenes', 'rehearsal', 'session', 'very', 'cool', 'perspective', 'watch', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'full', 'close', 'full', 'performances', 'most', 'songs', 'see', 'real', 'prep', 'work', 'performing', 'song', 'get', 'glimpse', 'personalities', 'camaraderie', 'band', 'performers/dancers', 'course', 'MJ.The', 'film', 'director', 'Kenny', 'Ortega', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'theHigh', 'School', 'Musicalmovies', 'Kenny', 'Michael', 'therapist', 'know', 'guy', 'Ben', 'Stein', 'monotone', 'delivery', 'Ortega', 'same', 'droning', 'voice', 'Ortega', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'comically', 'talking', 'child', 'therapist', 'Michael', 'prevent', 'having', 'tantrum', 'really', 'amusing.But', 'real', 'fun', 'watching', 'Jackson', 'perform', 'songs', 'probably', 'grew', 'up', 'band', 'really', 'Michael', 'age', '51', 'still', 'sang', 'angel', 'when', 'needed', 'could', 'rock', 'rest', 'when', 'wanted', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'low', 'boring', 'moments', 'DVD', 'when', 'was', 'was', 'looking', 'more', 'was', 'more', 'only', 'realization', 'was', 'really', 'King', 'Pop', 'left', 'fans', 'nice', 'parting', 'gift', 'DVD.Songs', 'include', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'Startin', 'Somethin', 'Speechless', 'Jam', 'Bad', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Care', 'Human', 'Nature', 'Smooth', 'Criminal', 'Way', 'Make', 'Me', 'Feel', 'Want', 'Back', 'Love', 'Save', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Shake', 'Body', 'Down', 'Ground', 'medley', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Loving', 'Thriller', 'Who', 'Beat', 'Black', 'White', 'Earth', 'Song', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'Man', 'Mirror']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

1284702,ALDJB8Q89T8GC,B002R0EIVI,SmartguyH,"[0, 0]","Okay I'm assuming you watched the movie, if not you can look at the other reviews. (It's spectacular to watch, and the music is so muuuucccchhhh better in a lot of ways than the album versions. It has more funk, especially WBSS in my opinion. I like that version the best.Extras:Okay it's so worth buying b/c there's an hour special which is pretty much a LOT MORE footage that you didn't get to see. There's a section specifically about how awesome the 3d effects would have been. And they give insight to Michael's notorious concert exits (post Bad tour) and how for this one, it needed to be topped. Here's a clue, it's in 3d!!!!For those that love the iconic look of MJ there's a section that shows sketch designs of some of the major costumes (WHAT THE HECK NO BEAT IT!!!!). The Thriller costume would have been one of my favorite. IT's a slightly glittered red jacket, fully crystalized black pants (like the gold version on the trailer or in the movie, but black), and these ultra cool red with black matching loafers (matches the Thriller jacket in brightness). The designer says of course he has black versions (I guess in case it was too much red, I thought they were cool.) He didn't show the black versions. I wonder if they would have looked like the Michael Jackson shoes for the 80s doll (red strip across. Sorta like the We are teh World shoes he ahs but red instead of gold). The Billie Jean costume would have been BAD. No joke. I can't say the idea was original, b/c Michael used these ideas, but they were never shown really to the public. He wore these on a date or two of the Victory tour concert. (I'm trying not to give it away, but if you went to Comic Con last year, you know what kind of MJ item was on display. Well this version is updated and takes it to the EXTREME. Totally cool) I don't wanna give it away. It is pretty much the same Biliie Jean costume but a cool kick added. The Blakc and White costuem was aweseome and the intro costuem IS AWESOME. The designer explains like five or six costumes in total, (sorry he didn't mention Bad or Beat It costumes, I don't know why)They say Thriller was extended and I know I saw the choreographer act in Michael's place and they did ""They Don't Care About Us"" which should still be online. It's FANTASTIC!!! But I didn't see that on here.Earth Song- Huge explanation about the song and the look of it. You get to hear from the little girl.They show what the intro woudl have been and Michael's entrance would have been like!! Wowwwww all I can say is wow, I wish artists would do this. If you've read ""On the Road with MJ"" then you'll know Mike did this to hype up the audience before the show started. Well this time, it's x 10 what he does to get the crowd hype.They speak about the O2 Arena and how it got built and why (great enlightenment on this segment. They mentioned about how Michael had wanted to tour in 2001 but all major acts cancelled their shows b/c of Sept. 11th and they got Mike to come to O2 later. That was great!Dancers auditions piece. (Personally, I didn't see the point of this. I guess since I'm a dancer I should care but, myeah I guess it helps the dancers get some fame.Get the 2 disc b/c some of the stuff I heard about wasn't on here or I didn't notice it.

I noticed somewhere that one reviewer didn't like the film because Michael wasn't singing at his full ability for some of the movie. Yes he was saving his voice for his tour. However even when he was using a small percentage vocally of what he had, it was  fantastic, and I was totally entertained. There were moments when he really broke out and put his all into it, and it was amazing.The movie also gave you a good look at some of what would have been seen on his concert tour, such as the music videos that were to accompany the stage performers.

I don't give a damn what the media say, MJ could not have done the amount of drugs they allege he did.  Michael was SHARP!!!

1284719,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B002R0EIVI,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[50, 56]","When Michael Jackson died on June 25th 2009 it seems a part of the world died with him. It made many people sad all over the world and it seems that for once everyone was being nice to this man who had always been abused by the Medias; journalists, interviewers and others. When I heard of the ""This Is It"" movie concert I didn't know what to think. I knew it was rehearsal footage from the 50 concerts he was to perform at the O2 arena but I didn't know what was going to come out of it or what they were going to do with it. When I saw the trailers I knew I had to see this and that ""This Is It"" was going to be something special like I've never seen. And that's precisely what I got, I even bought my ticket in advance for the movie and feel like it was much worth it.It amazed me how good MJ still was, the dance moves were great and fascinating to me. He was clearly the one in charge of the whole thing. He gave precise instructions of what he wanted, made sure everything was right and did everything that needed to be done. The film shows just how much Michael was respected, there were parts of it where they asked him if he wanted anything or what he thought and if he liked something, it seems no one assumed anything at all. When he talked the crew would listen and he asked things in the nicest way, never to hurt anyone. There's not a part that doesn't make him look like the nice guy he always was. There are mixed feelings about him after all the bad things that have been said about him but after watching this I don't know one could possibly believe them.To be honest I loved every minute of it, every song was special and was great to watch. Right from the beginning of ""Wanna Be Startin'Somethin'"" it was amazing. No matter how many people surround him he's always the one who does things better than anyone else and the one you're watching. This Is It was really a unique experience, I felt they chose the right footage parts for the movie and made him look great in every sense. They could truly have messed things up but they didn't and came out with an amazing documentary, it's sort of a testament to his fans, it's just very special. I really liked the Thriller 3D part, it was a 3D video shoot and afterwards you see MJ coming out onstage from a spider, the show would have looked awesome. They Don't Care About Us was amazing, The Smooth Criminal part was very interesting, so was the Earth Song which had a beautiful video of a little girl in a forest, waking up to see that all of it has been destroyed. I won't go further but every song had something about them.The stage show would have been grandiose, the fireworks, the ""fireball"" (quite impressive I won't spoil anything), pyrotechnics, the videos that accompany the songs are all very impressive. This could very well have been the best show ever had he lived to perform them. In the end I was quite amazed by the 1: 48 minutes I watched, I can't wait to see it again and the message Michael gives at the end is very inspiring. From the auditions of the brilliant performers to the credits with the ""This Is It"" song I was captivated.The said special features will feature more of the rehearsal and a two part documentary on Michael's history and his comeback along behind the scenes. I can't wait to see more of the rehearsal and hopefully the extras will be great and there will plenty to watch.It's hard for me to describe what watching this movie was like and what I felt about it. I know this is rehearsal footage but it's truly brilliant and while it main not catch Michael at his best it certainly catches him at his most honest. I don't have anything bad to say about either this movie or the man himself, This Is It is a must see. It doesn't matter if you watch in its theatrical run or on DVD/Blue Ray when released, this is amazing and his fans just have to see this. I will certainly be amongst those who buy it and watch it over and over again. This man gave his life to music and his fans and I don't remember where I heard or read this but I do remember that someone said: ""He was a gift of god, he was a kind human being who's been mistreated by many opportunists, he's been taken advantage of but he was the nicest person and could never harm anyone"" or sometime like that.

1284723,AX3T5TI76TOJ1,B002R0EIVI,TurquoiseEyes13579,"[1, 1]","I am a fan of MJ's going all the way back to the music from the early days of the Jackson Five. After being incredibly saddened by his untimely passing, I put off seeing this on cable for months. Partly because I was still mourning the loss of one of my childhood heroes. And partly because I didn't want to watch it and see a frail shadow of the man we knew in the 80's, performing old hits in poor voice and with half-a*s dancing. After all, the media had made it out to seem like he was on his last legs preparing for this tour, in horrible condition physically and musically. Ha, was I ever wrong, and so were his critics.I watched this from start to finish and despite it's long length, I could have watched much more. This is truly mesmerizing- the MJ of the eighties was still there, but a new intensity and sultry attitude made him seem more powerful and enigmatic than ever. His backing musicians and especially his backup dancers are the best I've ever seen, and their complete love and devotion for MJ and the tour they were sadly never to embark on was obvious. Love poured out of this whole film- I've never seen such a group of talented, focused, dedicated people come together. It was extraordinary. The old hits were there- ""Stop the Love"" and ""I Want You Back"" from the Jackson 5 heyday. ""Billie Jean"", ""Beat It"" and ""Thriller"" (which included a fabulously remastered version of the Vincent Price ""rap""- I swear, it sounded like Vincent had come back to life it my living room, it was so crystalline and vibrant). A spectacular rendition of ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" (never one of my favorites) had Michael singing better than he did on the ""Bad"" album, from which the song originally came. I couldn't believe what a fifty-year-old man was accomplishing vocally and in his dancing. There were more songs, but the standouts, which I did not at all expect, were ""They Don't Really Care About Us"" and ""Earth Song"". ""Earth Song"", especially, just got me down to the core. I had to fight back tears watching the indescribable video which was shot as a backdrop to this song, with MJ's lovely tenor singing lyrics that tore into me like a knife. Even writing this review, I find it hard not to recall what I watched without tears coming forth. The wonderful part was they played virtually every song in it's entirety, not just little snippets like some annoying DVD's of other singers. It really was like watching a whole MJ concert.Michael's voice was clear and the high notes were sung as well as he ever had as an adult, maybe better. And the dancing, my God- Michael was as lithe, fit and magical as ever on stage. His trademark precision and flexibility were on full display and he showed no signs of aging other than saving his voice for the actual concert. If he was not up to par here, I would say it. The MJ I saw in this movie was clear-headed, with the same phenomenal and futuristic vision that made us all stop and watch his ground-breaking videos in the 80's. He wasn't at all the foggy-minded, lost soul the media portrayed- he was a loving but strong and decisive man on this ill-fated tour. Let me tell you- all the skeptics, the naysayers and liars would be silenced after watching this. I feel incredibly sorry for the people who worked so hard on a tour that would never come to be, a tour they thought would be the highlight of their career.I will be buying this because I loved it so much, and hope the money goes to his wonderful children. Thank you, MJ, wherever you are, for this final gift. I hope your murderer spends the rest of his life rotting in prison, as was said in ""The Green Mile"", knowing he killed one of God's true miracles. May people remember you forever. I know I will.",5,A final gift he left to us fans,1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,3727,"['am', 'fan', 'MJ', 'going', 'way', 'back', 'music', 'early', 'days', 'Jackson', 'Five', 'being', 'incredibly', 'saddened', 'untimely', 'passing', 'put', 'off', 'seeing', 'cable', 'months', 'Partly', 'was', 'still', 'mourning', 'loss', 'one', 'childhood', 'heroes', 'partly', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'see', 'frail', 'shadow', 'man', 'knew', '80', 'performing', 'old', 'hits', 'poor', 'voice', 'half-a*s', 'dancing', 'media', 'had', 'made', 'seem', 'was', 'last', 'legs', 'preparing', 'tour', 'horrible', 'condition', 'physically', 'musically', 'Ha', 'was', 'ever', 'wrong', 'so', 'were', 'critics.I', 'watched', 'start', 'finish', 'long', 'length', 'could', 'have', 'watched', 'much', 'more', 'truly', 'mesmerizing-', 'MJ', 'eighties', 'was', 'still', 'there', 'new', 'intensity', 'sultry', 'attitude', 'made', 'seem', 'more', 'powerful', 'enigmatic', 'ever', 'backing', 'musicians', 'especially', 'backup', 'dancers', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'complete', 'love', 'devotion', 'MJ', 'tour', 'were', 'sadly', 'never', 'embark', 'was', 'obvious', 'Love', 'poured', 'whole', 'film-', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'group', 'talented', 'focused', 'dedicated', 'people', 'come', 'together', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'old', 'hits', 'were', 'there-', 'Stop', 'Love', 'Want', 'Back', 'Jackson', '5', 'heyday', 'Billie', 'Jean', 'Beat', 'Thriller', 'included', 'fabulously', 'remastered', 'version', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'rap', 'swear', 'sounded', 'like', 'Vincent', 'had', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'living', 'room', 'was', 'so', 'crystalline', 'vibrant', 'spectacular', 'rendition', 'Just', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Stop', 'Loving', 'never', 'one', 'favorites', 'had', 'Michael', 'singing', 'better', 'did', 'Bad', 'album', 'song', 'originally', 'came', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'fifty-year-old', 'man', 'was', 'accomplishing', 'vocally', 'dancing', 'were', 'more', 'songs', 'standouts', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'were', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Really', 'Care', 'Us', 'Earth', 'Song', 'Earth', 'Song', 'especially', 'just', 'got', 'down', 'core', 'had', 'fight', 'back', 'tears', 'watching', 'indescribable', 'video', 'was', 'shot', 'backdrop', 'song', 'MJ', 'lovely', 'tenor', 'singing', 'lyrics', 'tore', 'knife', 'Even', 'writing', 'review', 'find', 'hard', 'not', 'recall', 'what', 'watched', 'tears', 'coming', 'forth', 'wonderful', 'part', 'was', 'played', 'virtually', 'song', 'entirety', 'not', 'just', 'little', 'snippets', 'annoying', 'DVD', 'other', 'singers', 'really', 'was', 'watching', 'whole', 'MJ', 'concert.Michael', 'voice', 'was', 'clear', 'high', 'notes', 'were', 'sung', 'as', 'well', 'ever', 'had', 'adult', 'maybe', 'better', 'dancing', 'God-', 'Michael', 'was', 'lithe', 'fit', 'magical', 'ever', 'stage', 'trademark', 'precision', 'flexibility', 'were', 'full', 'display', 'showed', 'signs', 'aging', 'other', 'saving', 'voice', 'actual', 'concert', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'here', 'would', 'say', 'MJ', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'clear-headed', 'same', 'phenomenal', 'futuristic', 'vision', 'made', 'stop', 'watch', 'ground-breaking', 'videos', '80', 'was', ""n't"", 'foggy-minded', 'lost', 'soul', 'media', 'portrayed-', 'was', 'loving', 'strong', 'decisive', 'man', 'ill-fated', 'tour', 'Let', 'tell', 'you-', 'skeptics', 'naysayers', 'liars', 'would', 'be', 'silenced', 'watching', 'feel', 'incredibly', 'sorry', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'tour', 'would', 'never', 'come', 'be', 'tour', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'highlight', 'career.I', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'hope', 'money', 'wonderful', 'children', 'Thank', 'MJ', 'are', 'final', 'gift', 'hope', 'murderer', 'rest', 'life', 'rotting', 'prison', 'was', 'said', 'Green', 'Mile', 'knowing', 'killed', 'one', 'God', 'true', 'miracles', 'May', 'people', 'remember', 'forever', 'know', 'will']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

Here we see the preparation for his ill-fated London Comeback, but even though we all know how this story ends you can't help but smile when you see Michael in his home element and just having fun.  The most intriguing part about this documentary is the lack of actual Michael Jackson dialogue, but you can totally feel in his expressions the gears that work busily within; he was pouring every ounce of effort he could muster into this final effort to thrill the world.This is Michael Jackson unlike he's been seen in years.  Here he sings all of his songs live, even fast-past ones such as Jam, They Don't Care About Us, and Smooth Criminal - this element also really shows the fans how truly exhausting it was for him to put give the crowds dancing and singing, and this footage makes it obvious why for the Dangerous and History tours he had to lip sync several faster numbers.Many signature MJ dance moves are omitted, and I wish we could have seen some of the rehearsal footage without the occasional distraction of the 3-D short films (wish they had put it in a split screen so we could see that footage AND the stage performance at the same time).Highlight performances of the rehearsal are definitely as follows:They Don't Care About UsI Just Can't Stop Loving YouI'll Be ThereThriller (totally new production than the one used in Dangerous and History tours!)Beat It (first time in years I've seen him do the dance same as he did in 1982!)The others are good as well, but none of them are nearly as crisp, or polished as those numbers of the rehearsal.  Key point of this rehearsal footage is getting to getting to hear him sing his hits live, and it would have been better if the This Is It album included those instead of the studio versions...Also, Michael's new female guitarist is great (on the eyes and on the ears).Many signature MJ dance moves are omitted, and I wish we could have seen some of the rehearsal footage without the occasional distraction of the 3-D short films (wish they had put it in a split screen so we could see that footage AND the stage performance at the same time).  So in fairness it isn't at all an MJ concert experience, but it does have all the elements of one.The tagline of ""Get to know the man you never knew"" isn't really accurate because there's very little of actual Michael Jackson dialogue outside of seeing him say ""God bless you"" to everyone in the production team and noting when he thinks something needs to be changed about the way something's being done.All and all this is probably going to be remembered as being the greatest concert that never happened in the history of music.  From these few, vague snippets of what the actual This Is It concert we can see that Michael would have had a huge comeback through this concert series, and that once more he has proven that he was, and always will be the King of Pop.It is a reminded, that even though tabloids tried to cast him in evil light, Michael Jackson's ONLY message was one of love.

1284725,AMB2Z4FMDBWQY,B002R0EIVI,"VIDFAN ""specfellow""","[1, 6]","This DVD made me so sad that Michael Jackson died. What I noticed most about ""THIS IS IT"" is how thin and frail he looked. He pushed himself, obviously, but you could see he was struggling to offer the same amount of energy the much younger dancers had. In some dance sequences he barely dances (moves his arms and legs kind of half-heartedly, like afraid to do too much); sometimes he was robotic; and throughout he never sings, just lip syncs though all the songs. It's almost painful to watch, knowing that he was tricked into doing 50 shows when he was not up to it. He wasn't performing because he loved it and missed it, but because he had enormous debts. This was not a happy man, and now the company is trying to recoup their ticket losses by selling ""what might have been"". Well, judging by this video, what ""might have been"" might have been worse - suppose MJ had collapsed on stage during one the performances and died? He tries so hard in this video I can believe it happening - he didn't want to disappoint the fans. The other sad thing is the interviews with other dancers, all of whom are soooo enthusatic and excited about working with MJ. Sadly, they all lost their jobs when MJ died. After all those months of training, that was awful. That was hard to watch too. It was too sad. But as films go, this concert film feels raw and thrown together - it's the sight of seeing MJ in his final performance that is the focus. Years later, when the grief has subsided, I'm sure others will see this as a rushed concert film, not particularly well-made or well-edited.",4,Watching a corpse dance - eerie!,1273708800,"05 13, 2010",2010,1577,"['DVD', 'made', 'so', 'sad', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'died', 'What', 'noticed', 'most', 'THIS', 'IT', 'how', 'thin', 'frail', 'looked', 'pushed', 'obviously', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'struggling', 'offer', 'same', 'amount', 'energy', 'much', 'younger', 'dancers', 'had', 'dance', 'sequences', 'barely', 'arms', 'legs', 'kind', 'half-heartedly', 'afraid', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'sometimes', 'was', 'robotic', 'never', 'just', 'lip', 'syncs', 'songs', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'knowing', 'was', 'tricked', 'doing', '50', 'shows', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'was', ""n't"", 'performing', 'loved', 'missed', 'had', 'enormous', 'debts', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'man', 'now', 'company', 'trying', 'recoup', 'ticket', 'losses', 'selling', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Well', 'judging', 'video', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'suppose', 'MJ', 'had', 'collapsed', 'stage', 'one', 'performances', 'died', 'so', 'hard', 'video', 'can', 'believe', 'happening', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'disappoint', 'fans', 'other', 'sad', 'thing', 'interviews', 'other', 'dancers', 'whom', 'are', 'soooo', 'enthusatic', 'excited', 'working', 'MJ', 'Sadly', 'lost', 'jobs', 'when', 'MJ', 'died', 'months', 'training', 'was', 'awful', 'was', 'hard', 'watch', 'too', 'was', 'too', 'sad', 'films', 'go', 'concert', 'film', 'feels', 'raw', 'thrown', 'together', 'sight', 'seeing', 'MJ', 'final', 'performance', 'focus', 'Years', 'later', 'when', 'grief', 'subsided', ""'m"", 'sure', 'others', 'will', 'see', 'rushed', 'concert', 'film', 'not', 'particularly', 'well-made', 'well-edited']",Michael Jackson: This Is It Theatrical Release

Baker ""Under Down""","[1, 2]","I never liked MJ,never bought his records,CD's, thought he was 100% guilty of all charges.But for some reason I went to see this movie. I was blown away!! From the dancer auditions at the beginning, the overwhelmed and crying winners of a world-wide search, to seeing them mastering the difficult performances and the joyous looks on their faces. From very talented Kenny Ortega's stage direction and visions to the extremely classy and grown-up renditions of those visions. What I thought would be a modern thuggy, rappish, gangster-like show, was clean, classy and happy. I'm 65, I'd have PAID to see this show!Then there was Michael himself. Instead of the self-mutilated, adrogynous, over-drugged bi-racial""creature"" that he had become, I saw an extraordinarily talented artist with more vision than even Ortega. If the day had ever come when Michael could not perform, he'd have had a super back-up career as a stage director. It was fascinating to witness the artist doing it again and again until he had it perfect. Also with the constant gum chewing I will speculate that MJ was indeed on amphetamine during the day to the extent the only way ""down"" at night was a needle and anesthesia in the jugular. He basically went down the Judy Garland road which only dead ends.Therefore I was forced to break MJ into 2 people: the good one and the other one. I fell in love with the good one, the artist, the creator of some terrific stick-in-your-head songs, dancer and visioner. I have watched this movie at least 14 times and I tear up at the beauty of most of the songs and acts.I saw a cartoon in the paper after his death: Heaven and Hell flipping for his soul,""Your call."" Don't know where he ended up, but I'm sure the Good Michael went to where he can look down and be very pleased with this excellent movie that the multi-talented Ortega directed.Sorry you didn't value your kids and life over your career, Michael, but I understand. You WERE your career. You had no other identity. I cried also for the young dancers who worked so hard and saw only part of their dream realized. A great and beautiful movie!

1284730,A22TRZC8HTRSRU,B002R0EIVI,"William Alexander ""Alexander, Shaun""","[4, 14]","I have never been a huge Michael Jackson fan, although I have always enjoyed his music.  Futher, I think his most lasting artistic contribution will not be in music, but in his collaborations with choreographers, most notably the brilliant Debbie Allen.  He represented a revolution in modern American dance not seen since Fosse and Tharp, and all with a competence that rivalled Charise, Astaire & Rogers, and Kelly.  (Please forgive me if I have mis-spelled some of the surnames of these greats).In my opinion, his personal problems aside, Jackson the ""mega-talent"" deserved a better cinematic forum for a swan-song.This is, essentially, a documentary shot in the style of a concert.  But no amount of glam and glitz can cover the fact that the enigmatic celebrity was in serious decline.  To me, he appeared rickety and ill, his voice enfeebled and incapable of the range once so effortless, and his dancing lacking in the serpentine, frenetic, sexual urgency that once made it so visually commanding.  It was, I thought, a picture of a man in serious physical trouble, a ghost of his former greatness.  And that is sad, sad indeed.  And for a documentary, the dearth of information about the comeback concert and the man himself was jarring.  Documentaries, I thought, aimed at delivery of information above all other things.  In this aspect, the film falls quite flat.  I came away knowing very little.If one is available, I would purchase instead a video anthology of Jackson's video work from his salad days, when he soared at the height of his formidable abilities.  But not this.Recommended only for the die-hard fan.  Otherwise, I would pass it up for a better offering.ADDED NOTE:  I should disclose that I saw this in the theatre, and not in DVD format.

It was sort of disgusting to see all his dancers and the ""tour manager""? just bow down to his feet.  I guess that goes hand and hand in the entertainment field, the kissing of bootie, all about the $$$.  Most of the performances were gr8, but I had 2 fast forward some of the content towards the end, it just went on 4 2 long.  By they time they got 2 Beat It, I was sort of done, I got the picture.  I'm sure the dancers were completley devastated by his passing, knowing they went thru all that 4 nothing.  But they seemed super phony anywayz so I didn't care either way.
