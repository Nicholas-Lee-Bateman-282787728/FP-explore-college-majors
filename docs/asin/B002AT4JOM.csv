Both it and this one - LIFE IS HOT IN CRACKTOWN - came to me via Amazon's Vine Program. And I was becoming rather tired of the careless films that tended to populate The Vine's DVD list. Well, Life Is Hot In Cracktown has reformed me ...somewhat. It isn't great. It isn't stupendous. But it is gritty, real, and put together in a way that made it extremely watchable.All of these characters are well-rounded and exceptionally well acted. There will be someone that every watcher will be able to connect with. Whether it's the young boy looking after his younger sister as his mother and her boyfriend get high and leave them alone for days, or the pre-op transsexual Marybeth (Kerry Washington,The Last King of Scotland) and her emotionally labile boyfriend Benny, or Manny, the guy working two jobs trying to support his wife Concetta (Shannyn Sossaman,Wristcutters - A Love Story) and their colicky baby, or the gang-banger Romeo who's life on the street is turning him into a dangerous individual, there's someone here for everyone.The interest comes in the fact that you watch most of these people make horrible decisions or do terrible things, yet you cannot look away or even condemn them. They are the best and worst of us all, and it shows a rugged side of humanity that most of us would rather not see ...except to realize that one of these people might have been you had you not had a few breaks. It's frightening and enlightening.The best part of the film is toward the end as we watch each person forced to make a decision and wonder at what the outcome will be. It is a turning point in their lives and we are given front row seats to it. Amazing how it all came together.Watching the special features, I have to disagree with Kerry Washington's comment about transsexuals never being shown on film in any meaningful way. The filmTransamericafocused specifically on this subject and was a fantastic film. Just FYI, Kerry.Anyway, this film is actually quite good, even though I found the title a bit unfortunate.",4,"Unfortunate Title, But A Very Well Done Flick...",1251849600,"09 2, 2009",2009,2135,"[""'m"", 'gon', 'have', 'eat', 'crow', 'here', 'especially', 'complaining', 'last', 'film', 'reviewed', 'Shadowheart', 'one', 'LIFE', 'HOT', 'IN', 'CRACKTOWN', 'came', 'Amazon', 'Vine', 'Program', 'was', 'becoming', 'rather', 'tired', 'careless', 'films', 'tended', 'populate', 'Vine', 'DVD', 'list', 'Well', 'Life', 'Is', 'Hot', 'Cracktown', 'reformed', 'somewhat', ""n't"", 'great', ""n't"", 'stupendous', 'gritty', 'real', 'put', 'together', 'way', 'made', 'extremely', 'characters', 'are', 'well-rounded', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'acted', 'will', 'be', 'someone', 'watcher', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'connect', 'young', 'boy', 'looking', 'younger', 'sister', 'mother', 'boyfriend', 'get', 'high', 'leave', 'alone', 'days', 'pre-op', 'transsexual', 'Marybeth', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Last', 'King', 'Scotland', 'emotionally', 'labile', 'boyfriend', 'Benny', 'Manny', 'guy', 'working', 'two', 'jobs', 'trying', 'support', 'wife', 'Concetta', 'Shannyn', 'Sossaman', 'Wristcutters', 'Love', 'Story', 'colicky', 'baby', 'gang-banger', 'Romeo', 'who', 'life', 'street', 'turning', 'dangerous', 'individual', 'someone', 'here', 'everyone.The', 'interest', 'fact', 'watch', 'most', 'people', 'make', 'horrible', 'decisions', 'do', 'terrible', 'things', 'yet', 'can', 'not', 'look', 'away', 'even', 'condemn', 'are', 'best', 'worst', 'rugged', 'side', 'humanity', 'most', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'see', 'realize', 'one', 'people', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'not', 'had', 'few', 'breaks', 'frightening', 'enlightening.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'end', 'watch', 'person', 'forced', 'make', 'decision', 'wonder', 'what', 'outcome', 'will', 'be', 'turning', 'point', 'lives', 'are', 'given', 'front', 'row', 'seats', 'Amazing', 'how', 'came', 'together.Watching', 'special', 'features', 'have', 'disagree', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'comment', 'transsexuals', 'never', 'being', 'shown', 'film', 'meaningful', 'way', 'filmTransamericafocused', 'specifically', 'subject', 'was', 'fantastic', 'film', 'Just', 'FYI', 'Kerry.Anyway', 'film', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'even', 'found', 'title', 'bit', 'unfortunate']",Life Is Hot In Cracktown

McVay ""Writer""","[1, 3]","I haven't read the novel the film was adapted from, but I really think the movie did a great job of introducing the diverse characters quickly and completely. I instantly felt the emotional depth of each character and cared about what happened to them. The story jumps back and forth between Marybeth, Benny, Manny, Willy and his sister Susie, Willy's mother and her boyfriend, Romeo. The stories blend well as the characters often cross paths while they traverse the slums of the city, all of them fighting to survive and trying not to give up on their dreams. The only frustration I had was it ended too quickly. I would've liked to have seen more, since in some cases there was no clear cut conclusion (especially in the case of young Willy). Perhaps Giovinazzo was leaving room for a great sequel?

Afterwards I stopped the movie & attempted to watch alone later.  Even then those type of scenes seem to overshadow the other details, leaving the feeling of dread that I prefer not to watch most of the time.

There are a lot of good actors in it, including Ileana Douglas, Kerry Washington, Desmond Harrington (who I didn't realize was a character in the show Dexter until after I had looked it up) and I enjoyed Evan Ross's acting, because his character was the most difficult to watch.I'm not even sure I could describe why it was average. I guess it's because it didn't blow me away. Yes, there were shocking scenes, (a girl getting raped, men and children beaten, violence abound) but something was off. Maybe I'm jaded because I've seen too many movies like this before. Maybe it didn't seem ""gritty"" enough. Maybe I've just seen this done one too many times, but better. I gave it three stars because as I had mentioned above, there was some good acting. I didn't turn it off, and I looked away at times when some scenes were hard to take.

It seems as though the filmmakers were a little bit afraid of digging deep into the issues that plague the ""cracktown"". This movie is not very graphic and personally I would have preferred an unabashed look at the problems these people face, where as here it came off as a bit watered down. Now there are many issues addressed, just not to the full luster that they could have been. But really that is my only issue with the movie, and it could have been cut to receive the R rating for all I know. The acting is incredible, and I recognized many of the names in this movie and I have seen them in very different roles, in this movie they really get to stretch out their acting prowess and put on very good performances. The different stories allowed for many viewpoints and different sets of issues, which worked wonderfully, not a single side story was uninteresting. The direction was also very well done, as there was never a dull moment and the intensity of the issues at hand was dealt with deftly. This is a very powerful movie with a lot to say, and while I would have preferred to see a director's cut version, because I imagine it exists, this is still a very poignant and well done drama.

""Come with me ... I wanna show you something."" He leads her by the hand down an alley, at the end of which is a mattress on the ground and a group of his friends, who proceed to brutally gang rape her.The film doesn't get any easier or nicer from there. ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"", the title of which sounds like either a dark comedy or a grindhouse B-movie, clearly aims to show humanity at its most brutal, soulless, and cruel. The viewer is taken on a tour of a poor, inner-city neighborhood, where most of the characters have ties to hard drugs, either through being addicts, dealers, or police officers. The combination of poverty, despair, and drug abuse has created situations that range from bleak to horrific.""Precious"" was a film that balanced its brutal portrayal of urban poverty with enough humor and fantasy to keep it from being too bleak. ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" aims for pure gritty realism. At its best, it succeeds, and at its worst, it seems exploitive and sensationalistic.What redeems the film is the performances. Kudos to Evan Ross, who plays Romeo, for infusing his monstrous, sadistic character with tiny shreds of humanity. When I first saw Kerry Washington in the film, I thought she was basically just playing the same character (a drug addicted prostitute) that she played in ""The Dead Girl"", until it quickly becomes clear that her character is actually a transgendered woman, and she delivers the powerful, multi-faceted performance needed.

Maybe that's why I was so pleasantly surprised by how much I actually liked it.  The performances are first rate, as well as the writing and directing.  In his interview, included in the special features, the director says that he doesn't expect viewers to like the characters in the movie.  What surprised me so much was how much I DID like them.  Yes, they have all kinds of problems.  Yes, they make all kinds of mistakes.  However, they also, in spite of all those problems and mistakes, TRY their best to do whatever they can for the people they care about - and they do care about others and have others who care about them.  I think that's what hooked me into the story.  These people's lives are terrible, but they still go on having real relationships and trying to make a go of it in their own strange brand of ""normal"".  The only complaint I have - and I'm pretty sure it only applies to the R rated version of the movie that I watched - is that the editing is pretty sloppy.  Parts of scenes are cut out in a very rough manner that makes the cut extremely obvious.  I'm sure the cuts were made to obtain the R rating, but it really takes you out of the story for a few moments while you wonder what was cut instead of following what's continuing to happen on-screen.

You won't be able to forget this tragic drama no matter how hard you try.  Less than ten minutes into watching this film, I was thanking God that I didn't' live in Cracktown - the name given to a poverty-stricken inner city neighborhood where its residents are addicted to drugs, perversion and violence.It's easy to judge and condemn the characters in this film.  Except for Manny, who works two jobs to support his family, most of them do little to escape the nightmarish world of Cracktown.  They seem content to wallow in their destitution.  However, the plight of some of the characters made me want to cry.  For example, there is adorable Willy, a child who is often abandoned by his crack addicted mom; he is forced to fend for himself and his younger sister.  Marybeth's bizarre lifestyle repulses me but I sympathize with her yearning for love and acceptance, which we all crave.  Then there is the despicable gangster Romeo who beats, rapes and murders in order to satisfy his base, animalistic desires.  I hated and detested him so much that I was hoping to see him die.  These and other well-drawn characters seemed so real that I wanted to shout at them:  ""Get a job, get therapy, get religion, get anything!  Just get off your hind parts and get out of Cracktown before you die!""The cast is a gorgeous one - a veritable who's who of Hollywood stars.  My favorites included the talented Shannyn Sossamon (""One Missed Call"" and ""A Knight's Tale"") who was Concetta, a distraught mom taking care of her ailing infant.  Victor Rasuk (""Feel the Noise"" and ""Stop-Loss"") does a very believable portrayal of Concetta's workaholic husband, Manny.  The gorgeous Kerry Washington (""Lakeview Terrace"" and ""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"") is wonderful as Marybeth, the preop transsexual prostitute.  Horror star hunk Desmond Harrington (""Wrong Turn"" and ""Ghost Ship"") is excellent as Benny, Marybeth's lover.  Cute Evan Ross is the deplorable Romeo; he starred with Hilary Duff in ""Greta.""  Beautiful Lara Flynn Boyle (""Twin Peaks"" and ""Men in Black II"") has a glorified cameo as Betty McBain, a prostitute.""Life Is Hot In Cracktown"" is raw, dirty and repulsive.  It does not glorify and glamorous life in a drug addicted, gang infested neighborhood of the inner city.  Watching it will anger, frighten and sadden you.  My heart pounded with tension as gang members shot each other, police searched tenements with drawn weapons, mothers forced their children to beg for money or sell their bodies, and thieves pulled guns on store clerks.  This film is not for the timid.  It depicts graphic violence and sexual assault, including a gang rape.  The ending is brutal and will make you feel as though you've been punched in the stomach.Anchor Bay Entertainment has done an excellent job of presenting ""Life Is Hot In Cracktown.""  There is a trailer for this film and two more:  Val Kilmer is a thief performing his last heist in ""Columbus Day.""  In ""Skeleton Crew,"" evil is reborn when a film crew does a documentary at an abandoned insane asylum where a doctor butchered his patients.The deleted scenes for ""Life Is Hot in Cracktown"" are mandatory viewing, especially those that give more details concerning Manny and Concetta's efforts to leave Cracktown.  I preferred the alternate ending because it provides a ray of hope and is not as downbeat and depressing as the theatrical one.""Last Exit To Cracktown"" is an interview with director/writer Buddy Giovinazzo who wrote the novel on which the film is based.  It is a low budget film shot on location in a dangerous neighborhood in downtown Las Angeles.  According to Giovinazzo, it was the hardest film for him to make.  Time, money and security were in short supply.  Watching the lives of the transsexuals inspired him to write the novel.  Actual transsexuals were used as consultants and as extras.  He compared the film to a car wreck; you don't want to watch it but you can't help yourself.  He admits that ""Life Is Hot In Cracktown"" is not for everyone.  He hopes that we all see ourselves in the characters and realize that we, after a series of bad breaks, could be like them.  We must ask ourselves, ""What would we do if we were in their situations?""

To paraphrase Mr. Giovinazzo: ""I wanted to show that these people, despite their problems and situations, ultimately aren't all that different from you or me, that we're all maybe one or two pieces of bad luck away from living lives just as tragic and desperate.""This approach makes the film interesting, as normal, mundane concerns and interactions are stirred into the brutality and addictions and abusive behavior.  So we end up caring for these people (well, many of them, anyway), even as we're angry at them for their behaviors.  Also making the film interesting is its sympathetic view of its two transsexual characters, as the story doesn't lump them into the bad stuff going on around them (well, except for the fact that they're seriously drug addicted like so many of the film's characters), but rather portrays them as people trying to be true to themselves.Before concluding, I should again emphasize the brutality in the film.  This isn't an ""afterschool special"" version of drug addiction and urban blight.  This is very dark material, with few rays of light, that some people just won't want to sit through no matter how well done.  However, if you're like me and can sometimes embrace difficult, harsh material in order to avoid seeing the same old thing all the time, this film might be worth a look.",4,"More like, ""Life is Brutal and Horrible in Cracktown""",1290988800,"11 29, 2010",2010,1984,"['title', 'Life', 'Is', 'Hot', 'Cracktown', 'was', 'mostly', 'expecting', 'throwaway', 'exploitation', 'film', 'hoped', 'tolerably', 'engaging', 'story', 'movie', 'actually', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'serious', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'engaging', 'stylishly', 'directed', 'widely', 'reported', 'elsewhere', 'however', 'film', 'indeed', 'extremely', 'brutal.As', 'described', 'writer/director', 'Buddy', 'Giovinazzo', 'thoughtful', 'making', 'featurette', 'DVD', 'aim', 'film', 'was', 'present', 'in-your-face', 'unsanitized', 'essentially', 'hopeless', 'view', 'life', 'ghetto', 'then', 'inject', 'much', 'humanity', 'possible', 'crooks', 'drug', 'addicts', 'murderers', 'fringe', 'characters', 'display', 'paraphrase', 'Mr.', 'Giovinazzo', 'wanted', 'show', 'people', 'problems', 'situations', 'ultimately', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'different', ""'re"", 'maybe', 'one', 'two', 'pieces', 'bad', 'luck', 'away', 'living', 'lives', 'just', 'tragic', 'desperate', 'approach', 'film', 'interesting', 'normal', 'mundane', 'concerns', 'interactions', 'are', 'stirred', 'brutality', 'addictions', 'abusive', 'behavior', 'end', 'up', 'caring', 'people', 'well', 'many', 'anyway', 'even', ""'re"", 'angry', 'behaviors', 'Also', 'making', 'film', 'interesting', 'sympathetic', 'view', 'two', 'transsexual', 'characters', 'story', ""n't"", 'lump', 'bad', 'stuff', 'going', 'well', 'fact', ""'re"", 'seriously', 'drug', 'addicted', 'so', 'many', 'film', 'characters', 'rather', 'people', 'trying', 'be', 'true', 'themselves.Before', 'concluding', 'should', 'again', 'emphasize', 'brutality', 'film', ""n't"", 'afterschool', 'special', 'version', 'drug', 'addiction', 'urban', 'blight', 'very', 'dark', 'material', 'few', 'rays', 'light', 'people', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'sit', 'matter', 'how', 'well', 'done', 'However', ""'re"", 'can', 'sometimes', 'embrace', 'difficult', 'harsh', 'material', 'order', 'avoid', 'seeing', 'same', 'old', 'thing', 'time', 'film', 'might', 'be', 'look']",Life Is Hot In Cracktown
1259108,A3BAE79NXFDXGV,B002AT4JOM,"Joseph P. Ulibas ""Captain Couth""","[8, 10]","Life is Hot in Cracktown (2009) is a movie based upon a collection of short stories written by the director Buddy Giovinazzo. The film follows four story lines: a man who works two jobs trying to support his family and move out of the inner city, a brother and sister who try to survive in a roach infested hotel, a pre-op transsexual who works the streets to make ends meet and a young hoodlum who lives an empty life with no future to look forward to. They are just some of the faceless people who try to make a life inside a poverty stricken ghetto. even though they have a bleak present, something inside of these people drives them to try and look for a way out of there lives and look for a brighter future.I really enjoyed this movie. Most of the films I see about the inner city are full of cartoonish and stereotypical characters that you don;t care about. The people in this film are real as the person next door. I found a lot of the dialog and situations these people are faced with to be real and very authentic. Buddy Giovinazzo has come a long way since his first film (Combat ShocK) but he still retains the gritty realism and spirit of that film in his latest project. He seems to have a genuine feel for his characters and none of that pseudo-liberal guilt complex that similar films that come out of Hollywood have. No phony baloney middle class guilt trip here and I really appreciate that in a film like this one.The DVD comes with a twenty minute featurette on the making of the film, several deleted scenes (which should have been added in my opinion) a trailer for the movie and a couple of sneak peak trailers.  The film's soundtrack is available in 2.0 mono (which is the best one to listen to because the other one is in 5.1 and that one is too spread out to hear some of the dialog),  I have to give this DVD my highest recommendation possible.  An awesome film that will punch you in the gut with a shot of reality.",5,A unflinching and realistic look at life in the inner city.,1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,1944,"['Life', 'Hot', 'Cracktown', '2009', 'movie', 'based', 'collection', 'short', 'stories', 'written', 'director', 'Buddy', 'Giovinazzo', 'film', 'four', 'story', 'lines', 'man', 'who', 'two', 'jobs', 'trying', 'support', 'family', 'move', 'out', 'inner', 'city', 'brother', 'sister', 'who', 'try', 'survive', 'roach', 'infested', 'hotel', 'pre-op', 'transsexual', 'who', 'streets', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'young', 'hoodlum', 'who', 'empty', 'life', 'future', 'look', 'forward', 'are', 'just', 'faceless', 'people', 'who', 'try', 'make', 'life', 'poverty', 'stricken', 'ghetto', 'even', 'have', 'bleak', 'present', 'something', 'people', 'try', 'look', 'way', 'lives', 'look', 'brighter', 'future.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Most', 'films', 'see', 'inner', 'city', 'are', 'full', 'cartoonish', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'don', 'care', 'people', 'film', 'are', 'real', 'person', 'next', 'door', 'found', 'lot', 'dialog', 'situations', 'people', 'are', 'faced', 'be', 'real', 'very', 'authentic', 'Buddy', 'Giovinazzo', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'first', 'film', 'Combat', 'ShocK', 'still', 'gritty', 'realism', 'spirit', 'film', 'latest', 'project', 'have', 'genuine', 'feel', 'characters', 'none', 'pseudo-liberal', 'guilt', 'complex', 'similar', 'films', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'have', 'phony', 'baloney', 'middle', 'class', 'guilt', 'trip', 'here', 'really', 'appreciate', 'film', 'one.The', 'DVD', 'twenty', 'minute', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'opinion', 'trailer', 'movie', 'couple', 'sneak', 'peak', 'trailers', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'available', '2.0', 'mono', 'best', 'one', 'listen', 'other', 'one', '5.1', 'one', 'too', 'spread', 'hear', 'dialog', 'have', 'give', 'DVD', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'possible', 'awesome', 'film', 'will', 'punch', 'gut', 'shot', 'reality']",Life Is Hot In Cracktown
1259109,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B002AT4JOM,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","Buddy Giovinazzo writes and directs this adaptation of his own novel, which in both story and structure instantly made me recall films likeCrash (Widescreen Edition). Yes, this low-budget movie about the lives of several people living in inner-city New York will feel instantly familiar to many filmgoers. Life is Hot in Cracktown has an advantage though that many of the films like this one do not have; without the restrictions of a Hollywood movie, this film goes places that no Hollywood production would dare go.The film opens brutally with Romeo (Evan Ross), the ringleader of a group of thugs, leads a girl into a near-rape situation. Next, we meet Manny (Victor Rasuk) who works in both a convenience store and a low-rent hotel to be able to support his wife and child. At this hotel lives Willy, a 10-year-old boy, along with his younger sister, drug-addicted mother (Illeana Douglas), and her violent boyfriend. Finally, there's Marybeth (Kerry Washington), a pre-op transsexual and prostitute who lives with her husband Benny (Desmond Harrington).You'll see some familiar faces too, such as Brandon Routh (a.k.a. Superman) as a friendly junkie and Thomas Ian Nicholas as a young, rookie cop.Many, if not most, of the characters dabble in illicit drug use; specifically (you guessed it!) crack. Seeing the depths these character's have sunken to is tragic enough, but there's still more room for them to sink and the camera follows them through this process unflinchingly.Giovinazzo has no obligation to gloss over his characters and he has no problem showing them to us in all their depraved glory. There are some scenes in this film that are truly disturbing and difficult to watch. One scene in particular has Romeo and his thugs attacking an elderly man. Some may call this scene excessive, but it does a great job of illustrating how neither Romeo nor the rest of his gang possess any capacity for sympathy.What sets it apart from similar films and keeps it from just being a re-tread is that it gives the characters complete freedom to lead the plot to it's conclusion rather than relying on dramatic circumstances and life-affirming dynamics. There is no sense of optimism and even it's devastating, well-edited, and powerful conclusion doesn't try to lift that.I don't know how realistic it is as a portrait of life in inner-city New York, but it is realistic in the way it seems to follow the characters to their destiny rather than throwing their destiny in front of them. At the same time, it never asks us to sympathize with or loathe anyone, but just to watch them. It's realism is furthered in its treatment of the relationship between Marybeth and Benny, which could've been exploitative or could've become parody. Giovinazzo is smart, handling it like a typical male-female relationship.This is not a movie for just anyone and many will be turned off by its graphic content. If you're up for it, you'll find Life is Hot in Cracktown to be a raw, gritty movie with a subtle undercurrent of sensitivity. It's not perfect though and it's not unlike many other (better) movies that have come before it. It's not a masterpiece for that reason and that there's really no reason to watch the film more than once.GRADE: B(In comparing this film to several other films, specifically 'Crash,' I am fully aware the novel was released in 1993...Just so you know)",4,"Surprisingly Powerful, Well-Made Film",1253750400,"09 24, 2009",2009,3376,"['Buddy', 'Giovinazzo', 'adaptation', 'own', 'novel', 'story', 'structure', 'instantly', 'made', 'recall', 'films', 'likeCrash', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Yes', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'lives', 'several', 'people', 'living', 'inner-city', 'New', 'York', 'will', 'feel', 'instantly', 'familiar', 'many', 'filmgoers', 'Life', 'Hot', 'Cracktown', 'advantage', 'many', 'films', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'restrictions', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'film', 'places', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'would', 'dare', 'go.The', 'film', 'brutally', 'Romeo', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'ringleader', 'group', 'thugs', 'girl', 'near-rape', 'situation', 'Next', 'meet', 'Manny', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'who', 'convenience', 'store', 'low-rent', 'hotel', 'be', 'able', 'support', 'wife', 'child', 'hotel', 'Willy', '10-year-old', 'boy', 'younger', 'sister', 'drug-addicted', 'mother', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'violent', 'boyfriend', 'Finally', 'Marybeth', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'pre-op', 'transsexual', 'prostitute', 'who', 'husband', 'Benny', 'Desmond', 'Harrington', '.You', ""'ll"", 'see', 'familiar', 'too', 'such', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'a.k.a', 'Superman', 'friendly', 'junkie', 'Thomas', 'Ian', 'Nicholas', 'young', 'rookie', 'cop.Many', 'not', 'most', 'characters', 'dabble', 'illicit', 'drug', 'use', 'specifically', 'guessed', 'crack', 'Seeing', 'depths', 'character', 'have', 'sunken', 'tragic', 'enough', 'still', 'more', 'room', 'sink', 'camera', 'process', 'unflinchingly.Giovinazzo', 'obligation', 'gloss', 'characters', 'problem', 'showing', 'depraved', 'glory', 'are', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'difficult', 'watch', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'Romeo', 'thugs', 'attacking', 'elderly', 'man', 'may', 'call', 'scene', 'excessive', 'great', 'job', 'illustrating', 'how', 'Romeo', 'rest', 'gang', 'possess', 'capacity', 'sympathy.What', 'apart', 'similar', 'films', 'just', 'being', 're-tread', 'characters', 'complete', 'freedom', 'lead', 'plot', 'conclusion', 'rather', 'relying', 'dramatic', 'circumstances', 'life-affirming', 'dynamics', 'sense', 'optimism', 'even', 'devastating', 'well-edited', 'powerful', 'conclusion', ""n't"", 'try', 'lift', 'that.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'life', 'inner-city', 'New', 'York', 'realistic', 'way', 'follow', 'characters', 'destiny', 'rather', 'throwing', 'destiny', 'front', 'same', 'time', 'never', 'sympathize', 'loathe', 'anyone', 'just', 'watch', 'realism', 'furthered', 'treatment', 'relationship', 'Marybeth', 'Benny', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'exploitative', 'could', ""'ve"", 'become', 'parody', 'Giovinazzo', 'smart', 'handling', 'typical', 'male-female', 'relationship.This', 'not', 'movie', 'just', 'anyone', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'graphic', 'content', ""'re"", 'up', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Life', 'Hot', 'Cracktown', 'be', 'raw', 'gritty', 'movie', 'subtle', 'undercurrent', 'sensitivity', 'not', 'perfect', 'not', 'many', 'other', 'better', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'reason', 'really', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'more', 'once.GRADE', 'B', 'comparing', 'film', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'specifically', ""'Crash"", 'am', 'fully', 'aware', 'novel', 'was', 'released', '1993', 'Just', 'know']",Life Is Hot In Cracktown

For how many minutes must we be subjected to a howling baby's screams before the director feels we get it? One too many, maybe three. Same goes for some of the other of the many unpleasantries here.This film seems to almost revel in displaying sociopathic behavior, and while it's to be commended for seeking some kind of redemption for some of these characters, somehow it just didn't make me care for any of them very much.A few of the performances, however, are occasionally excellent, specifically Evan Ross, fine as the chief young hood, and especially Desmond Harrington as Benny. The one transcendent moment in the film for me comes at 22:12. Benny takes a crack hit in an alley and goes into a brief, mumbling anti-Shakespearean soliloquy that rings truer than true; finally, artistry! It is a truly solid bit of acting that unfortunately highlights what's missing from the rest of this film: masterfulness.It's all a little too gritty while still being a little too unbelievable in its depiction.

In fact, it is probably best that it only had a run on silver screens in New York and Los Angeles. I would have found it a very uncomfortable 100 min. theatrical residency. Featuring jaw dropping performances by Evan Ross, in yet another intense character study as Romeo.....a dangerously menacing character, Kerry Washington as a post-op transsexual, Victor Rasuk showcasing his sensitivity and sexiness at the same time and a brief appearance by Ileana Douglas in a stripped down role as a drug addicted mother. There is nothing easy about this film. But though it showcases the grittier side of human behavior, it also captures the honesty and beauty of a pure love as captured in performances by Victor Rasuk and a misfit love story featuring Kerry Washington.But it is Evan Ross that commands the viewer's undivided attention when he darts in and out of scenes with his predatory gait, misplaced value system and his demonstration of a human quickly becoming devoid of any recognizable emotion. This is Mr. Ross'  6th performance before his 21st birthday. He specializes in playing tough, lost and multi-layered, troubled teens on his way to being ""indie kid of the year"". In ""ATL"" he impatiently tried to rush through puberty as he romanced a thuggish future, in ""Pride"" he was the neighborhood misfit with bruting sensitivity, In ""Linewatch"" he portrayed an orphaned kid headed down a dark path, in ""Life Support"" he captured the dying angst of a young HIV-infected gay teen, in ""Gardens of the Night"" he once again plays an abandoned youth forced to learn the ways of the world to protect his adopted sister and himself from the pending cruel world and here in ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" he perfectly plays against type as a gang leader destined for finality. It will be  welcome relief to see Mr. Ross in his soon to be released, ""Greta"" love story w/Hillary Duff.....but judging from the trailer, he doesn't stray too far from his pursuit of the intense characters best associated with actor's actors like a young Al Pacino or a young Robert De Niro.It is hard to call this entertaining.

1259113,A1YVPBDG2OFMD2,B002AT4JOM,Leif Sheppard,"[0, 0]","I did not expect entertainment. Prior to seeing the film, I read a handful of plot synopses on ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" which all painted a picture of a complex narrative spanning dozens of characters and their problems with sex, drugs, money, or life in general. I also sough out specifics on why the film is rated R, to wit: strong violence, rape, drug content throughout, graphic sexuality, nudity, and pervasive language (for those who keep score). I was aware of the comparisons to the 2004 Oscar-winning film ""Crash"", high praise to be certain, and further evidence that this was to be a weighty film. The sort of film that wrestles with the inexplicable human predilection for self-destruction and its inevitable fallout on the unfortunate bystanders.So I did not expect entertainment. Unfortunately, in trying to so fervently rail against the injustices of man, the film collapses under its own weight as it minutely details the flaws and excesses of each character yet provides no cohesive statement about the entire convoluted affair. It isn't that the film should provide some cliched moral lesson or even a hollow attempt to suggest solutions, it's that the film comes off as an excessive and overwrought effort to shock the audience with explicit depictions of, well, nearly everything. Aside from the graphic rape scenes, one of the most disturbing scenes was one in which three young men robbed and horrifically brutalized an elderly man in his own apartment. Watching the film unfold gives the impression that it seeks to exploit the very vices it is presumably intended to attack.The low budget is a plus for this film, however, as the lack of Hollywood gloss only heightens the gritty feel. Though the cast is composed of relatively unknown actors, it's a strong collection of up-and-comers along with a handful of veteran C-listers. Desmond Harrington (of ""Dexter"" fame) and Kerry Washington (""The Last King of Scotland"") were two stand outs. ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" is an ambitious film that ultimately bites off more than it can chew.

Somewhat likable although they spend their days smoking crack.Then we have the story of Willy, a ten year old who willingly cares for his younger sister, begging on the streets for money to buy food while his mother and her abusive boyfriend smoke crack.Romeo, a gang member angry about the murder of his younger brother, terrorizes an old man for his monthly check.  Of course he also smokes crack.The only couple I could relate to would be Manny and his wife and their sick baby.  They live in a welfare housing.  Manny works 2 jobs to support his wife and baby.  Life is stressful for them as Manny and his wife get very little time to sleep due to the all night crying of their baby.  You do feel sorry for them.Good or bad, there is no real climax to this movie and I was happy it was over.No depth to the characters and at times the photography made me dizzy.Unless you're desperate to watch a movie, I'd advise you to skip this one.Thank you.MEF",2,Life is Tedius in Cracktown,1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,1228,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'end', 'was', 'anxious', 'get', 'over', 'with.Being', 'based', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'book', 'was', 'better.The', 'story', 'prostitute', 'transsexual', 'heart', 'gold', 'boyfriend', 'small-time', 'burglar', 'Somewhat', 'likable', 'spend', 'days', 'smoking', 'crack.Then', 'have', 'story', 'Willy', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'who', 'willingly', 'younger', 'sister', 'begging', 'streets', 'money', 'buy', 'food', 'mother', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'smoke', 'crack.Romeo', 'gang', 'member', 'angry', 'murder', 'younger', 'brother', 'old', 'man', 'monthly', 'check', 'course', 'also', 'crack.The', 'only', 'couple', 'could', 'relate', 'would', 'be', 'Manny', 'wife', 'sick', 'baby', 'live', 'welfare', 'housing', 'Manny', '2', 'jobs', 'support', 'wife', 'baby', 'Life', 'stressful', 'Manny', 'wife', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'time', 'sleep', 'due', 'night', 'crying', 'baby', 'do', 'feel', 'sorry', 'them.Good', 'bad', 'real', 'climax', 'movie', 'was', 'happy', 'was', 'over.No', 'depth', 'characters', 'times', 'photography', 'made', 'dizzy.Unless', ""'re"", 'desperate', 'watch', 'movie', ""'d"", 'advise', 'skip', 'one.Thank', 'you.MEF']",Life Is Hot In Cracktown

Sherwin,"[4, 6]","Before I go into this review, I must caution people that Life is Hot in Cracktown has an awful lot of extreme violence and there is some nudity as well. This is anything but a family film; and indeed, after watching and reviewing Shutter Island just three days ago I can honestly say that this makes Shutter Island look like something put out by The Walt Disney Studios. This is not to say, however, that this motion picture is bad--in fact, it's really rather well done; but it's not for the faint of heart at all.Life is Hot in Cracktown does have its noted similarities to Crash; only the action is extremely rough and the outlook bleak at best for its principle characters. There are four major stories told throughout this film although none of them is finished when it ends; this gives the film a slice of life quality that I actually enjoyed very much.When the film starts, it isn't long before we meet Marybeth (Kerry Washington), a pre-op transgender person who is loved by a straight man called Benny (Desmond Harrington). Things are much more complicated, though: they each use drugs and while Marybeth uses heroin Benny smokes crack to get by; and their money woes never seem to stop. In addition, there's ten year old Willy (Ridge Canipe) and his younger sister who live in a flophouse with two crack addicted adults one of whom is his mother (Illeana Douglas). Moreover, there's Romeo (Evan Ross, who gives a particularly stunning performance) who leads a street gang and who doesn't care what damage and violence he does to others. Finally, there are Concetta (Shannyn Sossamon) and her husband Manny (Victor Rasuk) who are struggling to get out of the ghetto and into a much better life as far away from there as they can get.The acting is uniformly excellent and the cinematography and choreography work wonders for this low budget film. The DVD comes with a few extras. I enjoyed the commentary by director Buddy Giovinazzo and the deleted scenes are also very interesting to watch. Look also for very good performances by Mark Webber as Ridley; Brandon Routh as ""Sizemore;"" Richard Portnow as ""the guy in 4K"" and Elena Franklin as Melody. Vondie Curtis-Hall also does an excellent job portraying a cop named Dixon.Overall, Life is Hot in Cracktown is certainly not for the faint at heart; it's quite graphic and the action, often violent, never stops from the beginning of the film up until the very final frame. I do recommend this film, however, for people who enjoy gritty, social issue dramas that tell it like it is about life in very impoverished neighborhoods and fans of the actors in this movie will want to get this for their collections.",5,a realistic social issues drama that could pass for horror,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",2010,2667,"['go', 'review', 'must', 'caution', 'people', 'Life', 'Hot', 'Cracktown', 'awful', 'lot', 'extreme', 'violence', 'nudity', 'as', 'well', 'anything', 'family', 'film', 'indeed', 'watching', 'reviewing', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'just', 'three', 'days', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'Shutter', 'Island', 'look', 'something', 'put', 'out', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'not', 'say', 'however', 'motion', 'picture', 'bad', 'fact', 'really', 'rather', 'well', 'done', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'all.Life', 'Hot', 'Cracktown', 'have', 'noted', 'similarities', 'Crash', 'only', 'action', 'extremely', 'rough', 'outlook', 'bleak', 'best', 'principle', 'characters', 'are', 'four', 'major', 'stories', 'told', 'film', 'none', 'finished', 'when', 'film', 'slice', 'life', 'quality', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much.When', 'film', ""n't"", 'long', 'meet', 'Marybeth', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'pre-op', 'transgender', 'person', 'who', 'loved', 'straight', 'man', 'called', 'Benny', 'Desmond', 'Harrington', 'Things', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'complicated', 'use', 'drugs', 'Marybeth', 'heroin', 'Benny', 'smokes', 'crack', 'get', 'money', 'woes', 'never', 'seem', 'stop', 'addition', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'Willy', 'Ridge', 'Canipe', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'live', 'flophouse', 'two', 'crack', 'addicted', 'adults', 'one', 'whom', 'mother', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'Moreover', 'Romeo', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'who', 'particularly', 'stunning', 'performance', 'who', 'street', 'gang', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'damage', 'violence', 'others', 'Finally', 'are', 'Concetta', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'husband', 'Manny', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'who', 'are', 'struggling', 'get', 'ghetto', 'much', 'better', 'life', 'far', 'away', 'there', 'can', 'get.The', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'work', 'wonders', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'enjoyed', 'commentary', 'director', 'Buddy', 'Giovinazzo', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Look', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'performances', 'Mark', 'Webber', 'Ridley', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Sizemore', 'Richard', 'Portnow', 'guy', '4K', 'Elena', 'Franklin', 'Melody', 'Vondie', 'Curtis-Hall', 'also', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'cop', 'named', 'Dixon.Overall', 'Life', 'Hot', 'Cracktown', 'certainly', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'quite', 'graphic', 'action', 'often', 'violent', 'never', 'beginning', 'film', 'up', 'very', 'final', 'frame', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'however', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'gritty', 'social', 'issue', 'tell', 'life', 'very', 'impoverished', 'neighborhoods', 'fans', 'actors', 'movie', 'will', 'want', 'get', 'collections']",Life Is Hot In Cracktown

We're introduced right off the bat to the fact that the characters live in a rough, crime riddled, depressing environment. Poverty, prostitution, rampant drug use - these people have it rough, and there's little to look forward to.The film is very poorly edited. The obvious edits are jarring and extremely distracting; in fact, there were a few times when I honestly thought part of the film was totally cut out by accident (what the heck actually happened to the young girl in the opening scene? is something missing?). Dialogue is mumbled and overpowered by background noises and music. I kept turning up the volume and rewinding to catch what the characters were saying.Still, I was determined to finish the film so I would have a complete picture on which to base an opinion. I gave up and threw in the towel shortly after the forced enema scene. Yes, you read that correctly. Forced. Enema. Scene.As some previous reviewers have pointed out, the style and concept here are much like that of Crash; vignettes of seemingly unrelated characters that I assume eventually intersect. Unfortunately, the poor technical qualities of the film combined with the jarring violence without context made me give up. Gritty reality makes for amazing viewing when done by the right hand. I don't think I would ever be able to say that a film in the vein of Crash (which I liked) is ""enjoyable."" Sheer entertainment is not the goal of these films, and I wanted to watch Cracktown in its entirety just to get the filmmaker's intent and message. I just couldn't do it.

The stories are graphic at times, but they show the subject quite literally as if you were a fly on the wall. There's no Hollywood shine or spin to sell you something, which makes this film so refreshing and engaging.I had a tough life growing up with a single parent mother and encountered many problems of my own, so some of the scenes in the movie brought tears to my eyes as I felt quite closely connected with the actors as they toiled with their circumstances. People that have enjoyed more sheltered lives may find the movie quite uncomfortable, but I think it is an important piece of work and educational in many respects too.I had to deduct a star for some irritating cuts. The film uses a cutting technique that deletes around half a second of footage, so the action jerks between two locations at times. I felt this was overdone and it started to irritate. I got the feeling that someone was experimenting and for me, that really distracted me away from the immersion.Overall, I felt that this was a movie with many messages and an insight into drug related lives that is quite accurate and focuses on people that are slipping under the control of addiction or coping with the collateral circumstances such as theft and violence. It also examines how cultures adapt and become entwined with the power struggles that surround drug use, including how impressionable children become the unfortunate fodder and victims of criminal intent.",4,"""Fly-on-the-wall"" candid insight into tough drug-related lives",1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,1647,"['exceptionally', 'acted', 'film', 'multiple', 'stories', 'people', 'coping', 'drug-related', 'pressures', 'one', 'best', 'portrayals', 'such', 'difficult', 'subject', 'matter', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'stories', 'are', 'graphic', 'times', 'show', 'subject', 'quite', 'literally', 'were', 'fly', 'wall', 'Hollywood', 'shine', 'spin', 'sell', 'something', 'film', 'so', 'refreshing', 'engaging.I', 'had', 'tough', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'single', 'parent', 'mother', 'encountered', 'many', 'problems', 'own', 'scenes', 'movie', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'felt', 'quite', 'closely', 'connected', 'actors', 'toiled', 'circumstances', 'People', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'sheltered', 'lives', 'may', 'find', 'movie', 'quite', 'uncomfortable', 'think', 'important', 'piece', 'work', 'educational', 'many', 'respects', 'too.I', 'had', 'deduct', 'star', 'irritating', 'cuts', 'film', 'cutting', 'technique', 'second', 'footage', 'action', 'jerks', 'two', 'locations', 'times', 'felt', 'was', 'overdone', 'started', 'irritate', 'got', 'feeling', 'someone', 'was', 'experimenting', 'really', 'distracted', 'away', 'immersion.Overall', 'felt', 'was', 'movie', 'many', 'messages', 'insight', 'drug', 'related', 'lives', 'quite', 'accurate', 'people', 'are', 'slipping', 'control', 'addiction', 'coping', 'collateral', 'circumstances', 'such', 'theft', 'violence', 'also', 'how', 'cultures', 'adapt', 'become', 'entwined', 'power', 'surround', 'drug', 'use', 'including', 'how', 'impressionable', 'children', 'become', 'unfortunate', 'fodder', 'victims', 'criminal', 'intent']",Life Is Hot In Cracktown
1259123,AQ2UN38CMK119,B002AT4JOM,P. Mann,"[1, 2]","Based on theshort story collectionof the same name and directed by the stories' author, ""Life Is Hot in Cracktown"" is a bleak portrait of a neighborhood (recognizably Los Angeles, where the film was shot, though the stories are, I believe, set in New York). Several different story lines run through the film, joined only by the setting, the violence, and the presence of crack cocaine. There are the two children, who live in a roach-infested apartment with their addict mother and her abusive boyfriend. There is the pre-op transsexual who lives with her thief boyfriend and who is addicted to crack. A few other stories fill out the film.In one sense, it's good that the stories overlap so little. A too-tight end in which everything is tied together neatly would undermine the basic point of the film. On the other hand, even despite the close narrative nexus, the film is obvious. We know where it's going from the beginning and, sure enough, it gets there, proceeding through the sordid waters of drugs, violence, and rape. The question is whether the trip is worthwhile. For me, it wasn't.The cast does its best, but the film is simply too busy without any particularly redeeming characters (save, perhaps, the young boy, but his part, which starts out strong, is soon reduced to standard fare) and without coherent motivations for the characters at times. If the point is for the film to have gritty, in-your-face realism, I think the film misses too often. If the point is to make the viewer care about the problems crack addiction causes, it didn't work for me, perhaps because the profusion of stories kept me from getting into the movie and, more importantly, in believing in the reality of the characters, their lives, or the film. I am certainly well aware that drug addiction destroys lives, but that awareness came long before this film and remained unchanged.

I tried on several occasions to watch it but could never find a reason to watch it more than a few minutes at a time.  I finally just gutted it out and forced myself to wait it out until the end.  I think I managed to finish it on my sixth try.This is easily one of the least pleasant movies that I have ever seen.  It starts with the characters.  The film is essentially an anthology show, telling the story of a number of characters in an area of a city that has been destroyed by drug culture.  OK, this is all well and good, but regardless of intent, a film is only as good as its characters.  I can honestly say that there was not a single character that I cared about even in the least.  I can honestly say that there was not a single minute of the film that I cared for in the least.

1259126,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B002AT4JOM,Scott FS,"[1, 5]","This movie, based on a 1993 novel (really a collection of stories) by Buddy Giovinazzi, is a gritty and unpleasant look at life in the inner-city (New York's Lower East Side, supposedly).  The loosely-connected stories share really only one thing: the descent into hell for those sad cases (and their families) who are addicted to drugs (the crack of the title) or the money it brings.This is not a movie for those looking for anyone sympathetic (though we are supposed to be moved by the story of a young man who decides he wants to live as a woman and gets breast augmentation surgery.  The 'transformation' is totally unbelievable complete with one terrible wig (why not grow your own hair out, guy?).  He is having problems with his self-identity (no kidding) and depends on his few friends for moral support.  His main friend is MaryBeth, a black woman who supposedly has undergone a more complete transition from male to female.  We do not believe this for a minute, as MaryBeth is played by an actress, Kerry Washington, who, though talented, cannot make us think she was ever a man.  (See Victor/Victoria for a similar lack of conviction on the part of Julie Andrews.)  MaryBeth is hooked up with a 'small-time' criminal, slow-witted Benny.Each one of the stories is downbeat.  Even the male-to-female transsexual comes to an unhappy end.  The other somewhat positive character is Victor Rasuk, who plays a guy trying to stay out of trouble and support his wife and ever-crying child.  Of course, he fails.The worst story involves a black gang led by the unpleasant and evil Romeo (Evan Ross), who support themselves by robbing, maiming, and dealing drugs.  They terrorize a old, white guy in the welfare apartment (where much of the unpleasantness occurs) for his welfare check, finally beating and sodomizing him to death.  There is, of course, no remorse.  Luckily, Romeo runs afoul of a rival gang and gets what is coming to him, too late for this reviewer.To me, this plays like a budget version of the much-superior 'The Wire.'  I suppose the budget was much smaller here, and the writing snappier, but my main complaint is that every last one of these stories is in varying degrees, grim and disheartening.For lovers of all that is disgusting in humans, this is your film.  For the average film-goer, I'd say, stick with 'The Wire' or any of a number of other films dealing with complete losers.  Way too downbeat for me.

Growing up in a largely lower class environment, with a former drug-addict mother, I have known many drug addicts and former drug addicts and I can honestly say that the depiction of many of the addicts in this film, especially Desmond Harrington's character, felt incredibly authentic and genuine. As for whether I liked the film or not, to be honest I did like it, at times it definitely felt like it was trying too hard to be shocking and that kept me from giving it 5 stars, but most of the characters, especially considering how bad they could have turned out given the circumstances they lived in, were oddly likable! They certainly didn't feel fake or stereotyped in any way, which made them more appealing to me. They still had hopes and dreams, and you could definitely sympathize with them, which made their circumstances all the more sad and depressing. I'm not a big fan of gritty films like this, but I couldn't stop watching this film, wanting to see how all the characters ended up, if they ever make it out of this hellish existence. The ending didn't offer any hopeful conclusions but I honestly didn't expect it to, real life isn't a fairy tale or sitcom, it can come close, but it can also be incredibly dark and tragic, Life is Hot in Cracktown takes an unflinching look at just how bleak life can be.

1259137,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B002AT4JOM,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 3]","""Life Is Hot in Cracktown"" is composed of many stories of desperate people living in tough surroundings trying to get by, either legally or illegally, as they do what they can to make a buck and survive.  The film offers a cross section of individuals from pre-op transsexual Marybeth (Kerry Washington); Manny (Victor Rasuk), who works two jobs to support his wife and child; a drug-addicted mother of two (Illeana Douglas); her abusive boyfriend (Edoardo Ballerini); and a gang member (Evan Ross) who thrives on terrorizing the elderly.  The movie aims at balance, but there are far more negative characters here than decent ones.  Director Buddy Giovinazzo has assembled an unusually fine cast and ambitiously attempts to show that environment is partly, but not entirely, the cause of crime.  This isn't a movie with admirable characters, which makes it difficult for the viewer to buy into and empathize with  them.  I enjoyed the performances, especially those of Ms. Washington and Mr. Rasuk.  The movie is violent and filled with R-rated language.  Quite frankly, it exploits a culture of people -- mostly poorly educated --  who have long ago given up on the American Dream and have turned instead to doing what's necessary to get by in an often unsympathetic society.  Giovinazzo doesn't shy from depicting the rampant poverty, lack of opportunity and corruption that perpetuate a situation of dismal despair. Characters and situations seem authentic, but the movie's pessimistic point of view will turn off a lot of viewers.",2,"A ""Grand Hotel"" of Poverty and Despair",1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,1535,"['Life', 'Is', 'Hot', 'Cracktown', 'composed', 'many', 'stories', 'desperate', 'people', 'living', 'tough', 'surroundings', 'trying', 'get', 'legally', 'illegally', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'make', 'buck', 'survive', 'film', 'cross', 'section', 'individuals', 'pre-op', 'transsexual', 'Marybeth', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Manny', 'Victor', 'Rasuk', 'who', 'two', 'jobs', 'support', 'wife', 'child', 'drug-addicted', 'mother', 'two', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'Edoardo', 'Ballerini', 'gang', 'member', 'Evan', 'Ross', 'who', 'terrorizing', 'elderly', 'movie', 'balance', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'negative', 'characters', 'here', 'decent', 'ones', 'Director', 'Buddy', 'Giovinazzo', 'assembled', 'unusually', 'fine', 'cast', 'ambitiously', 'attempts', 'show', 'environment', 'partly', 'not', 'entirely', 'cause', 'crime', ""n't"", 'movie', 'admirable', 'characters', 'difficult', 'viewer', 'buy', 'empathize', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'especially', 'Ms.', 'Washington', 'Mr.', 'Rasuk', 'movie', 'violent', 'filled', 'R-rated', 'language', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'culture', 'people', 'mostly', 'poorly', 'educated', 'who', 'have', 'long', 'ago', 'given', 'up', 'American', 'Dream', 'have', 'turned', 'instead', 'doing', 'what', 'necessary', 'get', 'often', 'unsympathetic', 'society', 'Giovinazzo', ""n't"", 'shy', 'depicting', 'rampant', 'poverty', 'lack', 'opportunity', 'corruption', 'perpetuate', 'situation', 'dismal', 'despair', 'Characters', 'situations', 'seem', 'authentic', 'movie', 'pessimistic', 'point', 'view', 'will', 'turn', 'off', 'lot', 'viewers']",Life Is Hot In Cracktown

1259139,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B002AT4JOM,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[0, 1]","""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" merits two stars for two actors. As the pre-op transsexual Marybeth, Kerry Washington shows depth and grace in a movie that has so little of these qualities that she seems four dimensional, and gang member Evan Ross (son of Diana) who tortures an elderly man for his welfare checks. Ross is so darkly evil that he burns the screen in his scenes. This pair of actors offer the highlights to an unrelentingly bleak film about the lowest part of a city where everyone's an addict, whore, or pimp with issues. Other than the characthers of Manny and his wife, no-one here offers any redeeming qualities. Anyone that might (the victimized old man, the cop whose been on the street just a little too long) seem like human props for the scumbags that populate cracktown to abuse.While this has made some interesting films in the past (thinkNew Jack City), ""Life is Hot In Cracktown"" isn't one of them. Scenes are telegraphed way in advance and so painfully slowly that you're three steps ahead when the point gets driven home. The editing is dreadful; at a few moments I was wondering if the scenes were being cut with a scissors and scotch tape. There's plenty done here for shock value (cockroaches crawling on a child's face, the transsexuals feeling each other up, an opening rape scene) but at little use to the story. After awhile I was really getting tired of waiting for something to happen, and the lack of a coherent ending just served to make me dislike ""Cracktown"" all the more.
