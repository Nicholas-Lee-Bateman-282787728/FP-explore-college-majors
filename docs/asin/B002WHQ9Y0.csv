Not everything is explained thoroughly, because it seems to be enough to state that it IS simply quite different from the TV series' plot. To what extent did this matter? I think it was just to give the characters we already know some different circumstances (pretty wild ones!) and see how they work in that environment. Perhaps even two hours wasn't enough for so much character exploration, but I think the point of the movie was to illustrate to what extent human beings can be understood. What matters in the end?

1296854,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002WHQ9Y0,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 3]","""Eureka SeveN"", the popular mecha anime TV series from anime studio, Bones, has spawned several video games, novels and now a movie.  What began as an animated series was then quickly adapted into a manga series which ran in Kadokawa Shoten's ""Monthly Shonen Ace"" from 2005-2006 with a total of 23 chapters.The anime series was a big hit in the US airing on the Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim"" and in 2009, ""Eureka SeveN: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"" was released in theaters during Golden Week and fans of the series would get a chance to see a new re-imagining of the characters for the film version.  Director Tomoki Kyoda (""Eureka Seven"" TV Series, ""RahXephon"", ""Skull Man"", ""Ouran High School Host Club"") wanted to make a film for those who never read the manga and never watched the anime series.  So, literally a film that would be brand new for anyone watching it.VIDEO:""Eureka SeveN: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"" is a Bones production that looks awesome on Blu-ray.  Featured in 1080p High Definition, the detail on the painted backgrounds are well-done and contain a lot of detail.Fans of the manga and anime series should be happy with the character designs by Kenichi Yoshida (""Overman King Gainer"", ""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"", ""Eureka Seven"" TV series) and the mechanical designs by Hiroyuki Yanagise (""Sakura Diaries"", ""Death Note"").The battle sequences look fluid in animation and Bones did not skimp on details as they had a lot of key animators and in-between animators working on this film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Eureka SeveN: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"" is featured in Japanese and English Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  I have to say that I was pleased by the lossless soundtrack.  Because of the amount of action in the film, there was great use of surround usage for explosions, weapons being shot out and hearing it pan from left to right.  Good use of LFE for booms and for the most part, crystal clear audio coming from the front and center channels. Dialogue and the music by Naoki Sato (composer for ""Heroic Age"", ""Mouse"", ""Sword of the Stranger"") sounds very beautiful in HD.As for the dub, this is about preference and the good news is that you get both Japanese and English lossless soundtracks.  I watched the English dub at the theater and once again on Blu-ray but also watched the film in Japanese to see if there were any audio differences and for the most part, action special effects and music were both fantastic on both soundtracks.  I did enjoy the more emotional voice acting from the Japanese lossless track but again, its all about preference and fortunately you get both lossless soundtracks.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Eureka SeveN: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"" contains the following special features:* Theatrical Trailer - (2:06) The original theatrical trailer for ""Eureka Seven: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"".* TV Commercial #1 - (:17) The first Japanese TV commercial for ""Eureka Seven: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers""* TV Commercial #2 - (:17) The second Japanese TV commercial for ""Eureka Seven: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"".* Making-of-Featurette - (50:18) The making-of ""Eureka Seven: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"".  Featuring director Tomoki Kyoda explaining the film and why they did a re-imagining of the ""Eureka Seven"" story for the film.  Also, the planning of the film up, storyboards, animation, recording the voice talent, ticket sales for the first screening of the film and the showcasing the journey from the film's infancy to the first screening of the film.* Trailers - Trailers for ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", ""Ghost In the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society"" and ""Sword of the Stranger"".JUDGMENT CALL:My first exposure to ""Eureka SeveN"" was actually from this film.  I have seen bits and pieces on television but I missed way too many episodes to comprehend what was going on and thus I passed.But since the first screening of the film, I started to get acquainted with the manga and anime series and for the most part, my enjoyment of the film is what made me want to learn more about it.I know with most people watching the film, they have some major knowledge of the TV and manga series but when I watched this film with a few friends who were also not familiar with the world of ""Eureka SeveN"", we enjoyed it.  Now knowing the differences between the characters of the film and the manga/anime series, personally I feel that this movie is easily accessible for those not familiar with the series and that's good thing.As for those who are fans, like any anime that is re-imagined and different from the original, I can understand if there are fans who are not appreciative of the changes and I'm sure there are those who are open to seeing what director Tomoki Kyoda and Bones had in store for the audience.  But I can tell you that watching the film on Blu-ray definitely made things more exciting as I had the opportunity to test out the lossless audio and just be in awe of how immersive the soundscape was.Bandai Entertainment did a magnificent job in the lossless audio treatment of this film.  Also, the picture quality was definitely great to see in 1080p HD and I was happy to see the 50-minute making-of Japanese special feature (with English subtitles) included.  But to my surprise, after the theatrical screening of ""Eureka SeveN: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"", there was a 25-minute featuring the English dub voice talent that is not included on this Blu-ray.  In a way, it's a shame because that featurette was hilarious and fun!  I'm surprised it was not included at all.  It would have been an excellent addition to the Blu-ray release and definitely would have made it a pretty complete release.Overall, for those who are familiar with the series may have quite a bit to talk about in terms of differences and their own opinions of the film.  But coming from a guy who watched the film along with his friends (who don't watch much anime) and didn't know too much about the manga and anime series at the time, the three of us enjoyed the film.  And as for the Blu-ray, Bandai Entertainment did a wonderful job in giving us a Blu-ray release with both lossless soundtracks and a beautiful animated film in HD.  The film has romance, action and all-out mecha battles.  Sci-fi/mecha anime fans will definitely find something to enjoy about this film.With a strong March week of anime on Blu-ray releases, ""Eureka SeveN: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers"" definitely stands out amongst the many anime titles available now on Blu-ray released in the US.Definitely recommended!",5,"Blu-ray: Romance, action and all-out mecha battles galore!

While not total garbage, there will be the inevitable comparison to Psalms of Planets which is absolutely superior in every way imaginable. This film takes the &#34;alternate universe - alternate telling&#34; idea and uses it to justify throwing all of the elements of the original series in a blender and reducing them to pulp, then selling it to consumers thus profiting off of it's wonderful predecessor.Let me start by saying what was good about the movie. The animation and visuals, while containing a large amount of stock footage from the series, was, for the most part above average. The use of stock footage is, in my opinion, forgivable considering the length of the original and the fact that it would be almost unnoticeable for anyone who hasn't seen the original. The music was also good, especially the song at the end credits that fit perfectly with the ending. Baby Nirivash was also kind of cute.Other than that, the movie was pretty much a train wreck. The plot was puzzling to say the least. I expect to be confused and have to follow an &#34;alternate universe&#34; plot line especially carefully, but I'm not quite sure that the writers knew exactly what they wanted to do with this thing from the start. Without 50 episodes to get to know characters motivations and distinct personalities, it takes some storytelling skill to make them convincing to viewers, especially ones who have watched the original series. To make things even more challenging, in true &#34;bizzarro world&#34; fashion the writers decided to take two of the wisest and most lovable characters from the first series and turn them into the weakest and most cowardly, then reward them by killing them in the most ridiculous of ways.While baby Niravash is cute as stated earlier, archetypes apparently don't go through puberty, because the adult version is annoying. The ending was pretty good as a sort of &#34;bizzaro&#34; version of the ending of the show, but it was far too little to late for this film to rescue it from the abyss. If you want to check out E7 watched the series and don't bother with this film. It can't hold a candle to the original and because of it's dependence on the original can't even stand up well on its own.",1,Don't bother...,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,2332,"['Whether', 'not', 'were', 'fan', 'original', 'series', 'should', 'avoid', 'movie', 'possible', 'not', 'total', 'garbage', 'will', 'be', 'inevitable', 'comparison', 'Psalms', 'Planets', 'absolutely', 'superior', 'way', 'imaginable', 'film', '34', 'alternate', 'universe', 'alternate', 'telling', '34', 'idea', 'justify', 'throwing', 'elements', 'original', 'series', 'blender', 'reducing', 'pulp', 'then', 'selling', 'consumers', 'thus', 'profiting', 'wonderful', 'predecessor.Let', 'start', 'saying', 'what', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'animation', 'visuals', 'containing', 'large', 'amount', 'stock', 'footage', 'series', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'average', 'use', 'stock', 'footage', 'opinion', 'forgivable', 'considering', 'length', 'original', 'fact', 'would', 'be', 'almost', 'unnoticeable', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'original', 'music', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'especially', 'song', 'end', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'ending', 'Baby', 'Nirivash', 'was', 'also', 'kind', 'cute.Other', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'train', 'wreck', 'plot', 'was', 'puzzling', 'say', 'least', 'expect', 'be', 'confused', 'have', 'follow', '34', 'alternate', 'universe', '34', 'plot', 'line', 'especially', 'carefully', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'writers', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'do', 'thing', 'start', '50', 'episodes', 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'motivations', 'distinct', 'personalities', 'storytelling', 'skill', 'make', 'convincing', 'viewers', 'especially', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'original', 'series', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'challenging', 'true', '34', 'bizzarro', 'world', '34', 'fashion', 'writers', 'decided', 'take', 'two', 'wisest', 'most', 'lovable', 'characters', 'first', 'series', 'turn', 'weakest', 'most', 'cowardly', 'then', 'reward', 'killing', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'ways.While', 'baby', 'Niravash', 'cute', 'stated', 'earlier', 'apparently', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'puberty', 'adult', 'version', 'annoying', 'ending', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'sort', '34', 'bizzaro', '34', 'version', 'ending', 'show', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'late', 'film', 'rescue', 'abyss', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'E7', 'watched', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'original', 'dependence', 'original', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'stand', 'up', 'well', 'own']",N/A

Cause really it's basically the same, so don't go into it expecting New New New, cause you will be disappointed. I think to truly experience everything this feature has to offer you NEED to watch the original.Now i'm not going to sit here and claim that this film is perfection because there is a certain scene in the movie that didn't needto happen, but there is like instant retribution for the event though. Besides that and maybe even a steep learning curve there isn't much to pick at.All and all. A must see for the faithful, and a slight warning to newcomers.P.S.

1296862,A1PDPHLILSJO1C,B002WHQ9Y0,TheKillShirt,"[7, 18]","I got a chance to see this movie at a special screening back in September. I really enjoyed the anime series and was looking forward to this adaptation. I knew going in that was a reimagining of the story, not a continuation. Still, I had high hopes. So believe me, my disappointment in the end result was all the more staggering. First off, and most egregiously, the movie reuses animation from the series, which is unacceptable. Even when they don't reuse footage, they cut corners by having far away and still shots with dialogue overlayed, so as to not have to spend money on animating the characters. Secondly, the new story is a total mess. I understand they wanted to take a new direction, but some of the choices for the characters are questionable at best, disgusting at worse. For instance, Dewey, the villain of the series, is now a pedophile who kidnapped the crew of the Gecko while they were still children for his own amusement. Huh? Really? And, oh yeah, Eureka? No longer an alien, but a robot. Yes. A robot. And Nirvash? Well, he was a little Pokemon-type creature that grew into a mecha. Seriously. And that's all just in the first half hour. All this and more, combined with the terrible english dubbing, made me walk out of a movie theater for the first time in my life. I highly doubt the ending redeemed it by any means. Even if you're a fan of the series - or ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of the series - I recommend avoiding this travesty at all costs.",1,The Only Movie I Ever Walked Out On,1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,1475,"['got', 'chance', 'see', 'movie', 'special', 'screening', 'back', 'September', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'anime', 'series', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'adaptation', 'knew', 'going', 'was', 'reimagining', 'story', 'not', 'continuation', 'Still', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'So', 'believe', 'disappointment', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'more', 'staggering', 'First', 'most', 'egregiously', 'movie', 'animation', 'series', 'unacceptable', 'Even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'reuse', 'footage', 'cut', 'corners', 'having', 'far', 'away', 'still', 'shots', 'dialogue', 'overlayed', 'so', 'not', 'have', 'spend', 'money', 'animating', 'characters', 'Secondly', 'new', 'story', 'total', 'mess', 'understand', 'wanted', 'take', 'new', 'direction', 'choices', 'characters', 'are', 'questionable', 'best', 'disgusting', 'worse', 'instance', 'Dewey', 'villain', 'series', 'now', 'pedophile', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'crew', 'Gecko', 'were', 'still', 'children', 'own', 'amusement', 'Huh', 'Really', 'oh', 'yeah', 'Eureka', 'No', 'longer', 'alien', 'robot', 'Yes', 'robot', 'Nirvash', 'Well', 'was', 'little', 'Pokemon-type', 'creature', 'grew', 'mecha', 'Seriously', 'just', 'first', 'hour', 'more', 'combined', 'terrible', 'english', 'dubbing', 'made', 'walk', 'movie', 'theater', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'highly', 'doubt', 'ending', 'redeemed', 'means', 'Even', ""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'ESPECIALLY', ""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'recommend', 'avoiding', 'travesty', 'costs']",N/A
1296863,A2ZGYYV4WWE6JE,B002WHQ9Y0,Tiffany,"[1, 3]","I just watch it yesterday and it was a Great movie! If you seen the series don't expect this to be the continuation of the 5oth ep or the side story. This is a remake or re re-imagination the story with a lot of twist in the story short of similar to Escaflowne the movie!3 years after Eureka Seven TV series end, Bones released Eureka Seven - Pocket Full Of Rainbows (a.k.a Eureka Seven the movie) with a new concept and storyline. I just finished watching it not long ago and it is a great movie! As a great fan of Eureka Seven, I have decided to write a short review and share some of my thoughts.Since it is based on a new concept and storyline, it is very different from the TV series. The whole story mostly focus on the interaction between Eureka and Renton, where they know each other since childhood, how they were separated, meet each other again and fall in love. There isn't much footage and appearance for the sub characters, so fans of them might be disappointedUnlike the TV series, the movie don't have much friendly interaction between Gekko State and Renton & Eureka but instead you get to see a lot of negative emotions, especially anger, doubt and desperation. If you watched the TV series, you will be shocked by how they changed some of the characters' personality.The storyline and concept is okay, but I can't really understand the 4th quarter of the movie. If you watched the movie, hopefully we can exchange some thoughts about it.Things I like about this movieFans of Eureka will be really happy for this (me too!). TV series portray Eureka as a girl that doesn't know how to show emotions, but in the movie, Eureka becomes a lovely and sentimental girl. There are a lot of lovely scenes between Eureka and Renton, which makes her cute, naturally. She even has a new long hair look in the movie!!! In otaku term, The movie is great, but I would advise Eureka Seven's fans to watch it as an alternative story instead of relating it with the TV series. There are a few parts that disappoints me , like ""borrowing"" the battle footage from the TV series, and movie's picture quality wasn't as good compared with others. But overall, I enjoyed the movie. The dubbed is here and the motion of the ending was great.So beware if your a Die hard Eureka 7 fan and think this is going to be a continuation or side story, better think again. But It a very nice movie to watch and enjoy.",5,"A great movie but not as great as the seires but if you haven't seen the series I""ll consider this!",1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,2401,"['just', 'watch', 'yesterday', 'was', 'Great', 'movie', 'seen', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'continuation', '5oth', 'ep', 'side', 'story', 'remake', 're', 're-imagination', 'story', 'lot', 'twist', 'story', 'short', 'similar', 'Escaflowne', 'movie', '3', 'years', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'TV', 'series', 'end', 'Bones', 'released', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'Pocket', 'Full', 'Rainbows', 'a.k.a', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'movie', 'new', 'concept', 'storyline', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'great', 'movie', 'great', 'fan', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'have', 'decided', 'write', 'short', 'review', 'share', 'thoughts.Since', 'based', 'new', 'concept', 'storyline', 'very', 'different', 'TV', 'series', 'whole', 'story', 'mostly', 'interaction', 'Eureka', 'Renton', 'where', 'know', 'other', 'childhood', 'how', 'were', 'separated', 'meet', 'other', 'again', 'fall', 'love', ""n't"", 'much', 'footage', 'appearance', 'sub', 'characters', 'so', 'fans', 'might', 'be', 'TV', 'series', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'friendly', 'interaction', 'Gekko', 'State', 'Renton', 'Eureka', 'instead', 'get', 'see', 'lot', 'negative', 'emotions', 'especially', 'anger', 'doubt', 'desperation', 'watched', 'TV', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'shocked', 'how', 'changed', 'characters', 'personality.The', 'storyline', 'concept', 'okay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', '4th', 'quarter', 'movie', 'watched', 'movie', 'hopefully', 'can', 'exchange', 'thoughts', 'it.Things', 'like', 'movieFans', 'Eureka', 'will', 'be', 'really', 'happy', 'too', 'TV', 'series', 'portray', 'Eureka', 'girl', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'show', 'emotions', 'movie', 'Eureka', 'lovely', 'sentimental', 'girl', 'are', 'lot', 'lovely', 'scenes', 'Eureka', 'Renton', 'cute', 'naturally', 'even', 'new', 'long', 'hair', 'look', 'movie', 'otaku', 'term', 'movie', 'great', 'would', 'advise', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'fans', 'watch', 'alternative', 'story', 'instead', 'relating', 'TV', 'series', 'are', 'few', 'parts', 'disappoints', 'borrowing', 'battle', 'footage', 'TV', 'series', 'movie', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'compared', 'others', 'overall', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'dubbed', 'here', 'motion', 'ending', 'was', 'great.So', 'beware', 'Die', 'hard', 'Eureka', '7', 'fan', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'continuation', 'side', 'story', 'better', 'think', 'again', 'very', 'nice', 'movie', 'watch', 'enjoy']",N/A
