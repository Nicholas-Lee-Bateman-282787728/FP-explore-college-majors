Still saddened by Queen of the Damned and the loss of actress Aaliyah (Aaliyah Dana Haughton) just a year before it's release.  Good vampire movie but, well, it's just sad that she really died.",4,Vampire faire for the young,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,312,"['Three', 'volumes', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'thought', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'added', 'plot', 'twists', 'made', 'interesting', 'places', 'Still', 'saddened', 'Queen', 'Damned', 'loss', 'actress', 'Aaliyah', 'Aaliyah', 'Dana', 'Haughton', 'just', 'year', 'release', 'Good', 'vampire', 'movie', 'well', 'just', 'sad', 'really', 'died']","4 Film Favorites: Vampires (The Lost Boys, Lost Boys: The Thirst, Lost Boys: The Tribe (Uncut), Queen of the Damned)"
