This movie gets 5 stars for the story and acting. I'm a fan of Dolly and James Woods.  If you don't like either of them, then this movie probably gets only 3 stars.Got this particular DVD set because it also had V.I. Warshawski, which was the only major Kathleen Turner movie that I never saw.  i would give it 2.5 out of 5 stars.  Bette Midler is great in Big Business and I give that movie 4 out of 5 stars.All three movies are 1.78:1 Widescreen versions.",5,great buy - 3 movies for the price of one,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,576,"['was', 'actually', 'looking', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'movies', 'Saw', 'Straight', 'Talk', 'television', 'long', 'ago', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'story', 'acting', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Dolly', 'James', 'Woods', 'do', ""n't"", 'then', 'movie', 'probably', 'only', '3', 'stars.Got', 'particular', 'DVD', 'set', 'also', 'had', 'V.I', 'Warshawski', 'was', 'only', 'major', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'movie', 'never', 'saw', 'i', 'would', 'give', '2.5', '5', 'stars', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'great', 'Big', 'Business', 'give', 'movie', '4', '5', 'stars.All', 'three', 'movies', 'are', '1.78:1', 'Widescreen', 'versions']",Big Business / Straight Talk / V.I.

I'm not a fan of the double-sided disc format, but haven't had any problems, so far. The movies themselves are typical 80's fare. However, I don't really care for V.I. Warshawski; something about it just bothers me. In Big Business, Bette Midler does this thing with her eyes where she makes them go from regular size, to really big and then back again. By my count, she does this 117 times. It's a little distracting but also kind of funny/amusing.
