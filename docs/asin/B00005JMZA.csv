Let me say this: it is cheesy to the extreme, but isn't that the point?  From what I've seen of the British show since seeing this movie, it was certainly never meant to be great art.  A major negative for me was the sappy dialogue.  I mean, how many times do they have to say, ""Thunderbirds are go!"" and what does ""F.A.B."" mean?  That being said, this was a fun film.  The kids are very engaging and I would say Brady Corbett (Alan Tracy) is going to be a big star someday; that is, if he can get past this film.  The adults are a bit much and I agree with the Amazon.com reviwer, the fabulous Ben Kingsley is certainly slumming.  Of the adults in the film, Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope is wonderfully over the top, not to mention her faithful manservant, Parker.  All that pink could be a bit much on anyone else, and she can kick butt, too.  This is above all a kids film, so you should take that into account when viewing the film.

624670,A3JI6QN6EVXQKW,B00005JMZA,"Amazon Customer ""MATT BLACK""","[2, 2]","Back in 1999 with the release of Star Wars - The Phantom Menace, some fanboy reviewer proclaimed; ""George Lucas has ruined my childhood!"" I wanted to slap the silly clown for reinforcing the stereotype that Science Fiction fans were snobbish nerds, obsessed with their entertainment. And although Phantom Menace was a rather mediocre film, it did NOT deserve that kind of vitriol.Gerry & Sylvia Anderson created several classic shows, but it is Thunderbirds that commands the most respect and love. It is a testimony to the quality of the 40-year old young-adult's show that Thunderbirds is still quite watchable today. What made the 1960s show work? (NOTE: the word ICONIC is about to be used a lot): The stories, the technology, the optimistic and lovable characters, the humour and the absolutely iconic vehicles make for an irresistible package, loved by hundreds of millions.WHAT'S GOOD: Say what you like about Director Jonathan Frakes, at least his film isn't boring. The cinematography is bright and pleasing. The sets are a satisfying blend of retro and modern, combined with bright primary colours. Tracy Island itself is beautiful, truly a paradise you'd want to live on. The visual effects are impressive. Then again, in this day in age there's no excuse for bad effects in a big budget picture. The re-design of the iconic Thunderbirds machines are, for the most part, pleasing. However, the new Thunderbird 2 looks like a flying saucer with a pointy nose. Sorry guys, you changed that icon WAY too much. But I didn't mind the new FAB 1, flying or not.Because Rolls Royce/BMW refused to be associated with a ""kids film"", they missed a valuable product placement opportunity. More fool them, as the new FAB 1 toys have all sold out in England and Europe.Sophia Myles is the new Lady Penelope and I'd say that a new star is born. Of all the actors in this movie, she is the one who comes off best and the character of Penelope survives the transition to live action reasonably well. Myles is drop dead gorgeous and all those other clich&eacute;s. Every time she appeared, she quite literally lit up the screen, Watch out for this young lady, she's going places!!Veteran British character actor Ron Cook is an adequate Parker, though the script supplies him with few really character defining moments. The old marionette Parker was a splendid cockney stereotype that nonetheless, could be relied on when the going got tough.WHAT'S BAD: I believe ""The Suits"" really got a hold of this potential franchise and dumbed it down to nearly ""Scooby-Doo"" levels. The script's lack of plot and style has set near record levels of puerility and mediocrity. It's NO boast to say that I could have done better myself. This film comes off like a illegitimate brother of the Spy Kids movies. I also watched with a sinking feeling as a cynical, second-rate rip-off of Harry Potter's Ron, Harry and Hermione trio was perpetrated in the form of Alan Tracy, Tintin and the totally unnecessary Fermat character.There is also the destruction of one of Thunderbirds most beloved and iconic characters; Brains. Anthony Edward's depiction is a cruel parody of our beloved geeky scientist, who in spite of his odd puppet caricature, stammer and thick glasses always had a charming dignity to him. But the movie-style Brains has the worst possible hairstyle and his speech impediment, never excessive in the puppet series, is exaggerated in an attempt to get cheap laughs. But I blame the script more than I do the actor. The live action ""Brains Hackenbacker"" has no dignity at all.Genre veteran Bill Paxton is the patriarchal action man, Jeff Tracy. During one of the films few high points he utters lines that almost manage to save the spirit of this Thunderbirds film. He sternly says to Alan Tracy that there are no shortcuts to achievement in life and that saving people is what International Rescue does, no matter what. Alan is played by Brady Corbet, who has an unfortunate tendency to stare open-mouthed when not delivering lines. Ben Kingsley as the Hood tries hard but lacks the arch-villain factor. His motivations in the film are a snooze: He blames Jeff Tracy for his old injuries (yawn) and wants to use the Thunderbirds to rob the Bank of England's vaults (yawn again!).The Hoods two main henchmen are badly written characters that manage to bungle nearly everything they do. They give no sense of menace or villainous competence at all. Am I missing the point? Are they supposed to be incompetent so three young kids, Ron, Hermio- er, I mean Fermat, Tintin and Alan can defeat them? No, plainly they suck. There's even homage to Harry Potter's Quidditch matches with a chase scene where Alan Tracy evades the baddies. Other things of note: The words: ""Thunderbirds created by Gerry Anderson"" does NOT appear in the opening credits, which are a cringe-worthy set of images with an annoying voiceover.There are several reasons for this, chief of which is Gerry Anderson's backing out at the last moment of any kind of endorsement of the project. And one of the film's worst failings is an abominable techno-backed version of the Thunderbirds overture. The original music, though a bit cheesy is dramatic, melodic and absolutely iconic. Hans Zimmer's music gives only moments of drama and majesty to this movie.There's always the possibility of an unwelcome remake that lurks unseen like a menacing shark, out in the dark waters of our pop culture. And we Thunderbirds fans could sense that predator out there; just waiting for the right moment to strike. Too dramatic? Perhaps. But at least Jonathan Frakes didn't ruin my childhood.Thunderbirds: The Movie was not a disappointment, because THAT would imply we didn't KNOW disappointment was coming.",2,A Dissapointment?

624671,A236V1U1P2K4OG,B00005JMZA,Andrew I. Munro Sr.,"[0, 0]","First off let me tell you, there is no bigger fan of the original 'Thunderbirds', than me. So it was with great trepidation that I finally sat down and watched this movie.I was happy to hear the re-mixed original theme from Barry Gray, although he doesn't appear to have been given credit.Also the cartoon opening was fun. I am glad they kept the '5-4-3-2-1 Thunderbirds are Go....' as part of the opening. Plus repeated references to the original puppet show with many ""F.A.B.'s"" and 'more 'Thunderbirds are Go' thrown in for good measure during the movie.They also were true to the original by keeping the design close to that of the original craft, even the udated Fab1, which was switched from a Rolls to a Ford Thunderbird.As for the actors, Parker was the closest to his 60's puppet incarnation. Lady Penelope was camp personified with her pink outfits and faux skin suitcases. Talking of fashion, all uniforms were given an update, not enough was seen of Scott and Virgil, Alan was the main focus as a pubescent teen, saving the day with Brain's son Fermat (proving someone actually slept with Brains) ??!!!! I felt both Alan and especially Tin-Tin were too young to have the crush on each other that they had in the 60's original. Bill Paxton as Jeff was more wooden than his puppet original...again we needed an older person cast. Ben Kinglsey was over the top as 'The Hood'...but again somewhat resembled the human version of the original.So all in all...flaws and all...I loved it. Just a shame there won't be a sequel.Now I am looking forward to the new Gerry Anderson approved CGI version of 'Captain Scarlet' !!But with all it's flaws...I still loved it.THUNDERBIRDS....ARE STILL......GO !!!!",4,"""Thunderbirds are ....CAMP""",1105833600,"01 16, 2005",2005,1706,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'tell', 'bigger', 'fan', 'original', ""'Thunderbirds"", 'was', 'great', 'trepidation', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'movie.I', 'was', 'happy', 'hear', 're-mixed', 'original', 'theme', 'Barry', 'Gray', ""n't"", 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'credit.Also', 'cartoon', 'opening', 'was', 'fun', 'am', 'glad', 'kept', '5-4-3-2-1', 'Thunderbirds', 'are', 'Go', 'part', 'opening', 'repeated', 'references', 'original', 'puppet', 'show', 'many', 'F.A.B', ""'Thunderbirds"", 'are', 'Go', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'movie.They', 'also', 'were', 'true', 'original', 'keeping', 'design', 'close', 'original', 'craft', 'even', 'udated', 'Fab1', 'was', 'switched', 'Rolls', 'Ford', 'Thunderbird.As', 'actors', 'Parker', 'was', 'closest', '60', 'puppet', 'incarnation', 'Lady', 'Penelope', 'was', 'camp', 'personified', 'pink', 'outfits', 'faux', 'skin', 'suitcases', 'Talking', 'fashion', 'uniforms', 'were', 'given', 'update', 'not', 'enough', 'was', 'seen', 'Scott', 'Virgil', 'Alan', 'was', 'main', 'focus', 'pubescent', 'teen', 'saving', 'day', 'Brain', 'son', 'Fermat', 'proving', 'someone', 'actually', 'slept', 'Brains', 'felt', 'Alan', 'especially', 'Tin-Tin', 'were', 'too', 'young', 'have', 'crush', 'other', 'had', '60', 'original', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Jeff', 'was', 'more', 'wooden', 'puppet', 'original', 'again', 'needed', 'older', 'person', 'cast', 'Ben', 'Kinglsey', 'was', 'top', ""'The"", 'Hood', 'again', 'somewhat', 'resembled', 'human', 'version', 'original.So', 'flaws', 'loved', 'Just', 'shame', 'there', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sequel.Now', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'new', 'Gerry', 'Anderson', 'approved', 'CGI', 'version', ""'Captain"", 'Scarlet', 'flaws', 'still', 'loved', 'it.THUNDERBIRDS', '.ARE', 'STILL', 'GO']",N/A

He and his two closest friends get their chance when the Father and 4 older brothers are attacked by a super villain known as 'The Hood' (Ben Kingsley) and need rescuing themselves.I liked this movie. It had a few lessons to teach about earning your way (no shortcuts) and being loyal. The only parts that disappointed me were a couple of ""man-bashing"" references during the film that seemed petty and inappropriate.

624674,AT57B36BHDQ00,B00005JMZA,Big Mike,"[3, 5]","I am an American living in England for five years now. Ironically enough, I will be visiting my native Georgia in a couple of weeks, where I plan to see the new big-screen version of Thunderbirds. This is despite the fact that the new film was actually released here in mid-July. I have become quite a Thunderbirds fan from watching the airings of the classic t.v. series here on the BBC. I have also just acquired the entire series and both films on newly remastered DVD, as well. I remember watching some of the other Gerry Anderson shows from my childhood in the 1960's in Georgia, but don't recall Thunderbirds. I remember watching Supercar and Stingray, (the latter series, which I also have on DVD, as well). I am somewhat surprised that the producers of the new film reportedly told Gerry Anderson that his involvement would not be required in the new film. Not very nice or a very promising start for the new film!! Also, from the clips and trailers I have seen, it looks a bit childish compared to the stories in the t.v. series. Also, Sophia Myles is really a lovely girl, but is badly miscast as Lady Penelope. Someone like Joanna Lumley would have been a much better choice for the role. After all, the ""real"" Lady Penelope was an older, wiser, more worldly and experienced woman. Like the previous two ""reviewers"", I have not yet seen the new film either. But unlike them, I am willing to take a chance and give it the benefit of the doubt. I encourage others to do the same. Having now seen the film, I now retract my opinion of Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope. She was the best thing about this film, although her Lady Penelope was somewhat more reminiscent of Diana Rigg's Emma Peel character from The Avengers than the Lady Penelope of the t.v. series. The biggest mistakes were making the youngest son Alan Tracy the central character, advertising and aiming the film at the kid's market, which turned away many potential adult viewers and again, the childish plot, which didn't feature enough disaster and rescue scenes, either. I seriously doubt there will ever be a sequel. Ron Cook was also excellent as Parker, as were Ben Kingsley as The Hood and Anthony Edwards as Brains. The rest of the cast ranged from being merely adequate to wooden. The special effects were ok, but somewhat disappointing for a big-budget, big-screen version of Thunderbirds. Most disappointing of all however was that they just didn't seem to understand that Thunderbirds is no more just a kid's puppet show than The Simpson's is just a cartoon, but that it has cult status.",3,"If you are a fan of the t.v. version, go see the new film",1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,2571,"['am', 'American', 'living', 'England', 'five', 'years', 'now', 'Ironically', 'enough', 'will', 'be', 'visiting', 'native', 'Georgia', 'couple', 'weeks', 'where', 'plan', 'see', 'new', 'big-screen', 'version', 'Thunderbirds', 'fact', 'new', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'released', 'here', 'mid-July', 'have', 'become', 'quite', 'Thunderbirds', 'fan', 'watching', 'airings', 'classic', 't.v', 'series', 'here', 'BBC', 'have', 'also', 'just', 'acquired', 'entire', 'series', 'films', 'newly', 'remastered', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'remember', 'watching', 'other', 'Gerry', 'Anderson', 'childhood', '1960', 'Georgia', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'Thunderbirds', 'remember', 'watching', 'Supercar', 'Stingray', 'latter', 'series', 'also', 'have', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'am', 'somewhat', 'surprised', 'producers', 'new', 'film', 'reportedly', 'told', 'Gerry', 'Anderson', 'involvement', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'required', 'new', 'film', 'Not', 'very', 'nice', 'very', 'promising', 'start', 'new', 'film', 'Also', 'clips', 'trailers', 'have', 'seen', 'bit', 'childish', 'compared', 'stories', 't.v', 'series', 'Also', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'really', 'lovely', 'girl', 'badly', 'miscast', 'Lady', 'Penelope', 'Someone', 'Joanna', 'Lumley', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'choice', 'role', 'real', 'Lady', 'Penelope', 'was', 'older', 'wiser', 'more', 'worldly', 'experienced', 'woman', 'previous', 'two', 'reviewers', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'new', 'film', 'either', 'am', 'willing', 'take', 'chance', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'encourage', 'others', 'do', 'same', 'Having', 'now', 'seen', 'film', 'now', 'retract', 'opinion', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'Lady', 'Penelope', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'Lady', 'Penelope', 'was', 'somewhat', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'Emma', 'Peel', 'character', 'Avengers', 'Lady', 'Penelope', 't.v', 'series', 'biggest', 'mistakes', 'were', 'making', 'youngest', 'son', 'Alan', 'Tracy', 'central', 'character', 'advertising', 'aiming', 'film', 'kid', 'market', 'turned', 'away', 'many', 'potential', 'adult', 'viewers', 'again', 'childish', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'feature', 'enough', 'disaster', 'rescue', 'scenes', 'either', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'sequel', 'Ron', 'Cook', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'Parker', 'were', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Hood', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Brains', 'rest', 'cast', 'ranged', 'being', 'merely', 'adequate', 'wooden', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'ok', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'big-budget', 'big-screen', 'version', 'Thunderbirds', 'Most', 'disappointing', 'however', 'was', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'Thunderbirds', 'more', 'just', 'kid', 'puppet', 'show', 'Simpson', 'just', 'cartoon', 'cult', 'status']",N/A

624678,A1HGTDDE35T13W,B00005JMZA,Cartoon lover,"[1, 1]","OK, let us be honest here - if you expected a live action film that was somewhat fateful to the original Gerry Anderson series, don't waste your time. The movie is a poorly written attempt to cash in on the Spy Kids franchise success. How?  The basic plot adds these two kids to the original team mix. These kids are then isolated on the Thunderbirds' base while the bad guy tries to take over by doing something that never occurred in the original series - sending the entire team on a rescue, save for Brains.  The movie is largely about these kids trying to defeat the bad guy.I could live with this, but the movie strays even further from the original Thunderbird canon.  There are funny sound effects when someone gets hit by a frying pan for example - more in tune with Bugs Bunny than the original Thunderbirds.  The bad guy - called the Hood and played by Ben Kingsley, who is quite an actor normally - does things that look like they were ripped off from Hidden Dragon, Crouching Tiger. And they finally refer to the team as ""Thunderbirds"" - one reporter asks ""Where are the Thunderbirds?"" during a disaster - when in the original series they are called INTERNATIONAL RESCUE - Thunderbirds are the names of the craft. And the tech that fired the imagination in the original series is largely gone.The original series is still beloved - indeed, when Aardman did Wallace and Gromit vs. the Wererabbit, there are several obvious homages to the Thunderbirds franchise.  In the original series, the writing was adult and the characters were adult - but this film is trying to imitate the SpyKids franchise by having the kids take center stage. In the original series, the basic premise was that there was a full blown disaster that could not be handled by the locals, and that was when International Rescue got into the situation, using high tech equipment that would fire the imagination of any kid, in much the same way that Star Wars fire the imagination of adults to create C3PO and R2D2 robots. This movie basically kills off the original premise.So to sum up - the movie is a derivative of Spy Kids - if you are interested in that aspect of it, and don't give one wit about how the film stacks to the original series, then the film does work in that regard, and it is adequate as a piece of juvenile entertainment.

I suppose that as I'm getting on a bit, pubescent teenage angst no longer appeals very much. I wanted to see the machines, the drama, the tension of people coping with disasters that took them beyond themselves, the triumph of decent people over nature's impersonal malevolence, and all that good stuff that the original had in abundance, along with a campiness and humor that didn't take itself too seriously. The original was about the adventure first, with the 'romance' incidental, and that's an important point, rather lost in this film.This is a teenage 'growing-up' movie that uses the Thunderbirds as a cover. It really didn't need the Thunderbirds part, except for the sets. The plot is otherwise perfectly ordinary and can be seen anywhere. The degree of improbability involved is far greater than the originals and a bit hard to stomach. The acting leaves a lot to be desired, and yes, the 1960s puppets often were a lot more lifelike than the actors in this film, and Ben Kingsley doesn't really come across as evil, or even bad-tempered.So, if you want a teenage movie like so many others, this is for you. If you want something like the original, don't bother with this film. Wait until someone has the guts to produce a 'grown-up' film (rated 'G') in the classic genre.

But it's still a heck of a lot of fun to see these gorgeous manifestations of the Thunderbirds...and the ships aren't half-bad, either! Yes, we know their proper name is ""International Rescue,"" and that they use a frequency so secure that The Hood (or Transom, a new character, played here by Rose Keegan) shouldn't have been able to track Thunderbird 5's location, and yes, the boys' birth order is thrown off and Brains is too old...but it STILL works.

624683,A1HX00DL0SZM1G,B00005JMZA,"Darren Harrison ""DVD collector and reviewer""","[15, 17]","Growing up in the UK I used to watch the show THUNDERBIRDS religiously, it was one of my must-watch TV shows for me in my pre-teen years.So it was with a certain sense of equal trepidation mixed in with insatiable curiosity that I approached the big budget live action version of the Gerry Anderson original.Director Jonathon Frakes (Riker on Star Trek) brings the same colorful look to THUNDERBIRDS as he brought to CLOCKSTOPPERS, he also brings some of the same qualities - chiefly a  light and loosely structured narrative.  Perhaps this is a right choice however given the light comic book-style subject matterYou may take from the above that I did not like THUNDERBIRDS. Not so. Apart from what I mention above the movie does have some bright moments of originality and conviction. Ben Kingsley is wonderfully over-the-top as the main villain The Hood and the film does sport some truly great special effects. Ron Cook also does a simply amazing impression of the original marionette Parker - I was very impressed.For those unfamiliar with the television show, let me fill in some background. The Tracy family (all male) - with the help of Brains and secret agent Lady Penelope (who seems to be very much inspired by Emma Peel)  - head an organization named International Rescue from a secret Island base in the Pacific. With several amazing aircraft, submarines, rockets and even a space station (called Thunderbirds) at their disposal they travel the globe rescuing people from harrowing situations.As this movie opens International Rescue (IR) is at it again, rescuing the crew of a stricken oil rig as the youngest of the Tracy siblings Alan Tracy (played by Brady Corbet) watches on television from his schoolroom.However all is not as it seems, one of the rescued oil workers manages to tag one of the ships with a tracking substance that (undetected by the International Rescue team) allows The Hood, a character capable of mind control, to discover the secret location of the IR base.Before long The Hood is in control of Tracy Island, the older siblings and father Jeff Tracy are trapped on a severely damaged space station and Lady Penelope, Parker and Brains are prisoners of The Hood. Its up to the younger members of the Tracy household (Alan, Fermat and Tintin) to rescue their parents and stop The Hood's plan to rob the world's banks using IR equipment.Herein lies my chief gripe with the movie, but luckily its not something the sinks the whole movie.Sure the series was made with children in mind, but that's no reason to make our chief protagonists children in the big-screen version. It's not needed, the cast of characters was already good enough without hindering the production with this often used (and now clich&eacute;d) plot device. How many times have we now seen this Harry-Potter inspired formula of young kids taking on adult roles?

624685,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00005JMZA,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 0]","Didn't ""Team America: World Police"" make fun of this in some shape?It's about a family of rescue workers called the titular name, going around the world to save civilians from disaster; they work under a lady named Penelope, who looks like the Orbit Gum chick.  The only family member that isn't part of the team is a kid named Alan Tracy (played surprisingly by Brad Corbet), who's friends with an old-fashioned nerd named Fermit, but he's not just any old-fashioned nerd, he's an old-fashioned nerd with a speech impediment.  He wanted to be part of the Tracy family Thunderbird legacy, but his father (Bill Coxton) said he wasn't ready,and so he ran away from home to live in the suburbs and torture Naomi Watts & Tim Roth. Okay, that last one didn't happen, but instead Alan stayed behind when the Thunderbirds received a distress signal from a space station, which turned out to be a trap laid by The Hood, the telekinetic villain.  The Thunderbirds are trapped, and it's up to Alan, his nerd friend, and the spunky girl named Tintin to save the day.  So, it's not really about the Thunderbirds but more about kisd trying to saving them.Just to nitpick a bit, I'm bugged that there aren't any mothers in this movie.  Alan's mother is dead and Fermit has a similar nerdy father working for the Thunderbirds but doesn't mention having a mom (almost as if Fermit's either adopted or existed specifically for this film); Tintin has a mother, but she's just there and nobody seems to acknowledge her, so she might as well be unnecessary baggage.That aside, I have nothing bad to say about this movie.  Its visuals are very colorful and cartoony, distracting I must say, but it's always refreshing to see an oversaturated design in this day and age of grey/brown color pallets.  Ben Kingsley played well enough as The Hood, who has his own amusing retorts; it's far from his best performances, but he's more dignified here than in ""The Love Guru"".  As far as the plot goes, it's tailor-made to be adventurous, but I thought it's underutilized in certain elements: it could've pulled a ""Hook"" when The Hood tried to convert Alan to his side using the kid's family problems, and it was revealed Tintin has the same powers as The Hood so she could've confronted The Hood about their lineage, but nothing came from such potential ideas.""Thunderbirds"" didn't push any boundaries or step into new directions for the genre, but it's safe as it can be.  I hate to use the term 'fun for the whole family' like how critics are paid to quote it in many children's videos, but it can be fun at times and I know some families will have a blast with it, so it's appropriate to describe this film as that.

Now one could hardly portray the original, with its miniature models and marionette actors, as an example of great filmmaking; but somehow it managed to exceed this live-action adaptation.  I especially did not care for Jeff Tracy and the other four brothers being relegated to sidekick status; and the enlarging of Jeff's role was, unfortunately, at the expense of the roles of Scott, Gordon, and Virgil.Yet, there is something very endearing about this movie.  I loved the three adolescent leads.  I especially loved Lex Shrapnel as John.  I'm a bit more ambivalent with Bill Paxton, who comes across as wooden in the role of patriarch Jeff as the puppet in the TV series--and his character in the movie just doesn't quite measure up to the strict-but-fair father of the original.  I was especially annoyed that Gordon and Virgil's parts were so reduced that I never could figure out which actor was which even after three viewings, especially as these characters are among my favorites in the TV series.  Sophia Myles as Lady P. was great; but I don't like pink and a little of her character went a very long way.The most surprising thing for me was how much I loved the character of Brains in the movie, as well as his newly-acquired son, Fermat.  The character of Brains is older than in the original, but somehow, in my opinion, this change suited him.  He has some of my favorite lines in the movie and some of the most intense scenes for me are the scenes with his son. I'm always a sucker for a good father/son story; and it says a lot about the lead actors that I found the relationship developed between Brains and his son to be much more compelling that the relationship between Jeff and Alan.As this film tanked at the box office, I doubt there will ever be a sequel; yet, I would have loved to have seen one just to see more of Brains and Fermat.",4,3-star movie that has some 5-star moments,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,1971,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'enough', 'watch', 'three', 'times', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'Now', 'one', 'could', 'hardly', 'portray', 'original', 'miniature', 'models', 'marionette', 'actors', 'example', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'somehow', 'managed', 'exceed', 'live-action', 'adaptation', 'especially', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'Jeff', 'Tracy', 'other', 'four', 'brothers', 'being', 'relegated', 'sidekick', 'status', 'enlarging', 'Jeff', 'role', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'expense', 'roles', 'Scott', 'Gordon', 'Virgil.Yet', 'something', 'very', 'endearing', 'movie', 'loved', 'three', 'adolescent', 'especially', 'loved', 'Lex', 'Shrapnel', 'John', ""'m"", 'bit', 'more', 'ambivalent', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'who', 'wooden', 'role', 'patriarch', 'Jeff', 'puppet', 'TV', 'series', 'character', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'measure', 'up', 'strict-but-fair', 'father', 'original', 'was', 'especially', 'annoyed', 'Gordon', 'Virgil', 'parts', 'were', 'so', 'reduced', 'never', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'actor', 'was', 'even', 'three', 'viewings', 'especially', 'characters', 'are', 'favorites', 'TV', 'series', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'Lady', 'P.', 'was', 'great', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'pink', 'little', 'character', 'went', 'very', 'long', 'way.The', 'most', 'surprising', 'thing', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'character', 'Brains', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'newly-acquired', 'son', 'Fermat', 'character', 'Brains', 'older', 'original', 'somehow', 'opinion', 'change', 'suited', 'favorite', 'lines', 'movie', 'most', 'intense', 'scenes', 'are', 'scenes', 'son', ""'m"", 'always', 'sucker', 'good', 'father/son', 'story', 'lot', 'lead', 'actors', 'found', 'relationship', 'developed', 'Brains', 'son', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'relationship', 'Jeff', 'Alan.As', 'film', 'tanked', 'box', 'office', 'doubt', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'sequel', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'just', 'see', 'more', 'Brains', 'Fermat']",N/A

My wife probably bought it. The movie is billed as a family movie and is squeeky clean. It was based on a long-running British Television show and familiarity with that show might enhance the viewing and enjoyment of the movie. Well, I'd never even heard of the show let alone view it.The movie involved the ""Thunderbirds,"" an international all-purpose rescue organization who came to the aid of anyone anywhere. I know, the whole idea is ridiculous, but this is a TV show, remember. In any case, the Thunderbirds were established on an island and supported by a billionaire and his family. They come to the aid of human as well as natural disasters with an amazing array of spacecraft vehicles and esoteric devices. In the story, an evil organization attempts to take over the Thunderbirds for the purpose of robbing banks. Again, remember, this was based on a children-oriented TV show. Well eventually, the bad guys are thwarted and peace returns to Thunderbird Island. It's an action movie and boredom is never a problem despite the absurdity of the script.Well, this movie is billed as a children's show that the whole family will enjoy. Perhaps. I thought the plot was awful. Really corny, but I could understand kids liking it. After all, kids were the main stars. To me it was somewhat fascinating in several respects. The sets and amount of effort put into filming was just amazing. I've never seen so many weird contraptions. And they were somewhat funny. In fact, the whole movie was visually funny, not laugh-out-loud funny, but kind of a droll understated humor. Very British. And I enjoyed it.

The film also makes Alan's love interest, Tintin, played by a pre-HSTM Vanessa Hudgens, younger  and added a son for resident geek 'Brains.' When the rest of the family is lured off and trapped by the evil Ben Kingsley, it falls to these three younger members to save the day.For all that as a kids' show, it works. Modern kids' stories do not involve kids watching the adults act as they did when Thunderbirds came out in 1964. They want to be in the action now.

Bernabo,"[2, 3]","When I decided to watch ""Thunderbirds"" I was expecting something more along the lines of ""Team America: World Police,"" at least in looks, than what I got.  Instead what I found was more like one of the ""Spy Kids"" movies, which is fine if you like that sort of thing, but my Tom Swift days are long ago and far away.  Undoubtedly I am hampered by have a less than sufficient knowledge of the 1960s British television series created by Gerry Anderson and employing ""Supermarionation,"" which is when you have marionettes with control wires connected to interior mechanisms that can control facial features and other things.  Since these puppets do not walk in anything close to a realistic manner, they tended to get around in great look vehicles depicting that wonderful future science fiction was promising us way back when.The story here is that the Thunderbirds are the heroes of the world, flying here and there in their fleet of rocket ships to do good deeds.  Their secret identities are the Tracy family, headed by the billionaire former astronaut Jeff Tracy (Bill Paxton), who has build a secret headquarters on an island in South Pacific.  His kids are named Scott (Philip Winchester), John, Virgil, Gordon, and Alan (Brady Corbet).  At this point all of the Baby Boomers in the audience should recognize the significance of those name (and think that Virgil should be called ""Gus"") while the Generation-X and younger set will be at a lost unless they have seen ""The Right Stuff.""  Anyhow, Alan wants to join the family business but he is still in school with his best friend, Fermat (Soren Fulton), the son of Brains (Anthony Edwards), the Thunderbirds's gadget expert.  There is also Tin Tin (Vanessa Anne Hudgens), Kyrano's daughter, who is of the age to notice Alan when he comes home for a visit and hope that maybe he will notice her in return.Jeff Tracy's insistence that Alan cannot take any shortcuts to joining the team becomes a moot point when the Hood (Ben Kingsley) shows up to take over the world and destroy the Thunderbirds as an appetizer.  Dad and the rest of the kids are off to save their space station, which means it is up to Alan, Fermat and Tin Tin to save the world.  Fortunately they get a helping hand and foot, respectively, from Parker (Ron Cook), the butler-chauffeur for Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, and Lady Penelope (Sophia Myles) herself.  Lady Penelope, who takes the idea of a pink fetish to hitherto unexplored levels, is the best thing in this movie with Myles playing the role on perfect pitch.  This is especially true for anyone who had Emma Peel imprinted on their young psyches as the idealized manifestation of beauty and kick-boxing ability.  Lady Penelope is stylish, elegant and poised.  She is a true English lady who loves danger but remains a cool-headed top secret agent who redefines the idea of pretty in pink for this century.The rest of the movie is kid's stuff and that is who is going to enjoy this film.  Alan and Tin Tin are certainly younger than they were in the classic ""Thunderbirds"" series, which is the best indication you have that director Jonathan Frakes's film is not aimed at the baby boomers who would actually recognize these characters and remember them with some sort of fondness.  Then again, if Lady Penelope is the best part of this movie I have to say that Tin Tin comes in second.  Paxton is trying to play parental blandness, Edwards is having a second childhood as a grown up nerd, and Kingsley is hopefully having fun playing a remarkably restrained and dry witted cartoon villain.  Only younger kids who can look forward to hitting puberty are really going to have any good reason to like this 2004 film.",3,A film for young kids but Lady Penelope rocks for everybody,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,3696,"['When', 'decided', 'watch', 'Thunderbirds', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'more', 'lines', 'Team', 'America', 'World', 'Police', 'least', 'looks', 'what', 'got', 'Instead', 'what', 'found', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'movies', 'fine', 'like', 'sort', 'thing', 'Tom', 'Swift', 'days', 'are', 'long', 'ago', 'far', 'away', 'Undoubtedly', 'am', 'hampered', 'have', 'less', 'sufficient', 'knowledge', '1960s', 'British', 'television', 'series', 'created', 'Gerry', 'Anderson', 'employing', 'Supermarionation', 'when', 'have', 'marionettes', 'control', 'wires', 'connected', 'interior', 'mechanisms', 'can', 'control', 'facial', 'features', 'other', 'things', 'puppets', 'do', 'not', 'walk', 'anything', 'close', 'realistic', 'manner', 'tended', 'get', 'around', 'great', 'look', 'vehicles', 'depicting', 'wonderful', 'future', 'science', 'fiction', 'was', 'promising', 'way', 'back', 'when.The', 'story', 'here', 'Thunderbirds', 'are', 'heroes', 'world', 'flying', 'here', 'there', 'fleet', 'rocket', 'ships', 'do', 'good', 'deeds', 'secret', 'identities', 'are', 'Tracy', 'family', 'headed', 'billionaire', 'former', 'astronaut', 'Jeff', 'Tracy', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'who', 'build', 'secret', 'headquarters', 'island', 'South', 'Pacific', 'kids', 'are', 'named', 'Scott', 'Philip', 'Winchester', 'John', 'Virgil', 'Gordon', 'Alan', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'point', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'audience', 'should', 'recognize', 'significance', 'name', 'think', 'Virgil', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'Gus', 'Generation-X', 'younger', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'have', 'seen', 'Right', 'Stuff', 'Anyhow', 'Alan', 'join', 'family', 'business', 'still', 'school', 'best', 'friend', 'Fermat', 'Soren', 'Fulton', 'son', 'Brains', 'Anthony', 'Edwards', 'Thunderbirds', 'gadget', 'expert', 'also', 'Tin', 'Tin', 'Vanessa', 'Anne', 'Hudgens', 'Kyrano', 'daughter', 'who', 'age', 'notice', 'Alan', 'when', 'home', 'visit', 'hope', 'maybe', 'will', 'notice', 'return.Jeff', 'Tracy', 'insistence', 'Alan', 'can', 'not', 'take', 'shortcuts', 'joining', 'team', 'moot', 'point', 'when', 'Hood', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'up', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'destroy', 'Thunderbirds', 'appetizer', 'Dad', 'rest', 'kids', 'are', 'save', 'space', 'station', 'Alan', 'Fermat', 'Tin', 'Tin', 'save', 'world', 'Fortunately', 'get', 'helping', 'hand', 'foot', 'respectively', 'Parker', 'Ron', 'Cook', 'butler-chauffeur', 'Lady', 'Penelope', 'Creighton-Ward', 'Lady', 'Penelope', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'Lady', 'Penelope', 'who', 'idea', 'pink', 'fetish', 'hitherto', 'unexplored', 'levels', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'Myles', 'playing', 'role', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'especially', 'true', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'Emma', 'Peel', 'imprinted', 'young', 'psyches', 'idealized', 'manifestation', 'beauty', 'kick-boxing', 'ability', 'Lady', 'Penelope', 'stylish', 'elegant', 'poised', 'true', 'English', 'lady', 'who', 'danger', 'cool-headed', 'top', 'secret', 'agent', 'who', 'idea', 'pretty', 'pink', 'century.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'kid', 'stuff', 'who', 'going', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Alan', 'Tin', 'Tin', 'are', 'certainly', 'younger', 'were', 'classic', 'Thunderbirds', 'series', 'best', 'indication', 'have', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Frakes', 'film', 'not', 'aimed', 'baby', 'boomers', 'who', 'would', 'actually', 'recognize', 'characters', 'remember', 'sort', 'fondness', 'Then', 'again', 'Lady', 'Penelope', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'Tin', 'Tin', 'second', 'Paxton', 'trying', 'play', 'parental', 'blandness', 'Edwards', 'having', 'second', 'childhood', 'grown', 'up', 'nerd', 'Kingsley', 'hopefully', 'having', 'fun', 'playing', 'remarkably', 'restrained', 'dry', 'witted', 'cartoon', 'villain', 'Only', 'younger', 'kids', 'who', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'hitting', 'puberty', 'are', 'really', 'going', 'have', 'good', 'reason', 'like', '2004', 'film']",N/A

624702,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JMZA,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[0, 1]","Remakes are popular in Hollywood.  I assume they are popular because people like me seem to try to recapture the feelings of their youth.  The biggest problem with remakes is that they rarely live up to the original.  Such is the case with the 2004 remake of ""Thunderbirds.""  The original series was cute and clever, using puppets and models in all the scenes.  The remake is sort of cute, but not very clever given that it is very derivative of the original, and not very original.The Hood (Ben Kingsley, who won an Oscar for his role in ""Gandhi"" and who seems to take any kind of role these days) menaces the Thunderbird team.  The Hood finds the secret island of The Thunderbirds, steals one of the Thunderbird ships to use to break into the Bank of England and thus discredit the Thunderbirds.  The Thunderbirds have to stop him.  The End.  I am serious.  There is little more to this movie than that.  Sure, there is some fighting and silliness, but most of that is to get the movie to be longer than an hour and a half.This movie is basically a Saturday morning kids show stretched out to movie length.  In many ways this movie is for children, even though few children even know who The Thunderbirds are.  I suppose that the focus of the movie is even narrower than that, because I suspect that boys will find this movie more fascinating than most girls.  The target audience seems to be boys between the ages of about 4 and 11.  I suppose that men older than 50 may want to give this movie a watch as well if they were fans of the original series.In spite of the fact that the movie is filled with factual and continuity errors (many of which may be viewed at the IMDB web site), this movie is actually kind of fun to watch.  I could not pull myself away, even though the plot was shallow and things failed to make sense (As one example, Thunderbird 3 supposedly has a booster failure and yet the booster seems to be working in all the scenes after the failure, most notably the landing in London).  I guess I fall into the category of guys over 50 who was a fan of the original series (and still am).As I said before, this movie probably has very narrow appeal.  I doubt most people will like it.  Even some fans of the original series may not like it.  But if you just have to have some kind of ""Thunderbirds,"" here it is.

624704,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00005JMZA,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[11, 13]","Just over 40 years ago, Gerry and Sylvia Anderson produced a brilliant television series in England entitled ""Thunderbirds"".  A total of 32 60-minute episodes were created between 1964 and 1966.  Following which, two big-screen motion pictures were also produced: ""Thunderbirds Are Go"" in 1966 and ""Thunderbird 6"" in 1968.  What made watching the Thunderbirds unique was that the Andersons did not employ live actors to perform in front of the camera; instead, the characters were puppets in a technique that the Andersons dubbed ""supermarionation"".  It was quite effective and, for the most part, the stories were highly creative and engaging.  The basic plotline for the Thunderbirds was that a family living on a secretive island created a set of rocket-propelled ships which they used to rescue people from various disastrous situations.  The family, known as the Tracy's, included several non-family members as part of their rescuing efforts: Brains (the genius who designed their rocket ships), Lady Penelope (a wealthy aristocrat) and her chauffeur Parker.  The Thunderbirds were not only popular with children; they also earned a cult following of adults.Hence, 36 years since any new material had been produced for the Thunderbirds franchise, a live-action version was filmed and released in theaters in 2004.  Under the direction of Jonathan Frakes (who is best known for his role as Commander William Riker on the long-running sci-fi TV series ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""), the 2004 film ""Thunderbirds"" was a very visually impressive reproduction of the original work that had been done with supermarionation.  Unfortunately, the film's story, which was clearly directed towards the youngest possible audience members (probably for children not older than 8), fell far short of pleasing adults and older children, especially those who were all-too-familiar with the original Thunderbirds, both from TV syndication and DVD's.  Having watched the original Thunderbirds long before the live-action film was produced, I, too, was quite disappointed with live-action reproduction.""Thunderbirds"" begins with a seemingly dangerous rescue effort being carried out by Jeff Tracy (Bill Paxton) and his sons Virgil Tracy (Dominic Colenso), Scott Tracy (Philip Winchester) and Gordon Tracy (Ben Torgersen) in Thunderbirds 1 and 2, while son John Tracy (Lex Shrapnel) is onboard the Earth-orbitting space-station Thunderbird 5.  Jeff's youngest son, Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet) is instead at a boarding school with his stuttering friend Fermat (Soren Fulton), who is the young son of the stuttering Brains (Anthony Edwards). and is filled with teenaged angst and impatience as he feels that he, like his father and brothers, should be part of the rescue efforts instead of attending school.  (Except for Fermat, none of his classmates or teachers knows that Alan is related to the real Thunderbirds.)  Here, then, are several of the film's most serious deviations from the original Thunderbirds concept: in the original Thunderbirds, father Jeff Tracy never participated in the actual rescues (he managed them from home), Brains did not stutter and Brains never had a son.  The two characters in the 2004 film who came closest to Gerry & Sylvia Andersons' original concepts were Lady Penelope (Sophia Myles) and Parker (Ron Cook).  They arrive in Lady Penelope's trademark, high-tech pink limousine at Alan's school to pick up him and Fermat for their school holiday, which will be spent back at the secretive Tracy Island.  However, unbeknownst to the Tracy's, their rescue efforts at the beginning of the film were planned by their arch-enemy, The Hood (Ben Kingsley), so that a tracer could be planted on Thunderbird 1 making it possible to locate Tracy Island.  Arriving at Tracy Island in a submarine, The Hood and his companions attack the orbitting Thunderbird 5 so that the Tracy's will rush off to rescue John who is onboard. Thinking that they can now easily take the island, their efforts are then thwarted (pretty much the bulk of the film) by Alan, Ferman and the young Tintin (Vanessa Anne Hudgens).What made the 2004 ""Thunderbirds"" so disappointing was twofold: the deviations from Gerry & Sylvia Anderson's original concepts and the fact that the film focused upon the three kids (Alan, Fermat & Tintin) and the Hood instead of the Tracy's and their rescuing efforts.  It could be effectively argued that the Tracy family and entire Thunderbird concept was just a backdrop for the story revolving around teenaged angst.  Hence, it is not at all surprising that after the film opened in theaters in August, 2004, it only earned approximately $15-million in both the U.S. and England; whereas the film's production budget was approximately $57-million.  Visually, the 2004 ""Thunderbirds"" was a magnificent live-action reproduction, but the story left much to be desired.  Consequently, I can only rate the 2004 ""Thunderbirds"" with 2 out of 5 stars.  Had Gerry & Sylvia Anderson been more directly involved with the production of this film, it probably would have been much better.",2,"Visually Impressive, But Lacked Original Anderson

Though this film version owes more to SPY KIDS and CODY BANKS with the main Tracey family sons as teens, and there's nothing wrong with that. The story involves evil genius The Hood(BEN KINGSLEY!) taking over Tracey Island - International Rescue and the Thunderbirds' secret island base - in order to hijack the Thunderbird aircraft to rob the world's banks. Unfortunately, astronaut father Jeff Tracey and his elder sons are trapped on Thunderbird 5, the space station that receives distress calls for IR to answer when The Hood fires a missile from his sub(!!). So it is up to younger son Alan Tracey, Tintin and others, including London agent Lady Penelope(Sophia Myles, watch out more for her in the future!) and trusty chauffeur PArker to save the day. The real stars here though are the action and SFX scenes, particularly when The Hood causes a bit of havoc in London by the Thames. Lots of fun for adults and great for the children to enjoy as well; and what a change it makes to see a family movie in which a family pulls together and solves their troubles as a team to get out of sticky situations instead of arguing dysfunctionally as is the case with most so-called family movies.

The question is whether there any actual fans of ""Cody Banks""? Both films have interesting production designs with a kind of 1960's James Bond look. But both suffer from the same basic problem, they are allegedly targeted at children and are supposed to be about children. Yet for some reason the casts are populated with adults and they keep throwing in gags and dialogue that are only appreciated by adults. Since the only adults likely to view either movie are parents who are watching it with their younger children (the last thing children over age 10 want to do is watch a kids film WITH their parents), this serves no useful purpose. No matter how many adult moments are thrown into these empowered kids movies, they will never actually be ""fun for the whole family"". But throwing in this ""sticks out like a sore thumb"" adult crap makes for a poorer children's film.Someday someone will figure out that the villains of these things should be the same age as the young heroes/heroines and that the adult roles should be kept at an absolute minimum.

With every passing minute of this film, my enthusiasm waned and my expectations slumped. I sat agape as this rubbish unfolded before me.Why is this film so bad? It is bad because it treats the TV series with utter -utter! - contempt. It abandons everything -everything! - that made the series such a delight. It abandons the highly distinctive and unique uniform of the Tracy brothers and replaces it for something ""more modern,"" although to my eyes the ""more modern"" uniform came straight out of a 1930s Flash Gordon movie - i.e., people wrapped in tin foil.It abandons the traditional non-violent plot line where there is a disaster ""somewhere in the world"" and only International Rescue can save the day. It is replaced with a hackneyed coming of age plot line.It abandons the 60s retro of the original series, which is a major part of Thunderbird's appeal.It abandons the main characters of Scott and Virgil and concentrates instead on peripheral characters, Gordon and TinTin, along with Brains' son, invented especially for this film.They get every detail wrong. In the series, Gordon pilot's Thunderbird 4. Here, he is a student who has yet to become part of the Thunderbird team. Brains is no longer just absent minded, he is positively creepy. The publicity shy team of the series now craves attention from the world's media. Even the design of the Thunderbirds has been changed - surely the greatest sacrilege of the film!It is as if the scriptwriter has never seen an episode of Thunderbirds in his life and has been told what it was all about by one of the producers over a drunken dinner.This film is the pits! It is even worse that the last Star Wars monstrosity. You could have resurrected Orson Wells, put him in every scene, and Thunderbirds would still stink! It is beyond redemption.

The original series was aimed primarily at teenage boys, who tuned in to see the Thunderbirds performing daring rescue missions.  The actual stars of show were the cool vehicles.  Given that rocket ships are no big deal today, making the focus of the movie a group of kids engaged in a goofy adventure, might make some sense.  However a feature film based on an old TV program with a niche audience appeal, targeted at a preteen audience, who are probably more familiar with Big Bird, than the Thunderbirds, hardly sounds like a formula for success.  That the film bombed, is really no surprise.The special effects are impressive and the updated Thunderbird vehicles look pretty cool, however not being eight years old, the storyline concerning the three kids who take over the film after the villains strike, wasn't particularly engaging.  Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet) comes across as a headstrong know it all.  Fermat (Soren Fulton) is the brainy one, who's also a sympathetic figure because he stutters.  While TinTin (Vanessa Hudgens) keeps this from being an all male affair.  She's smart, athletic, and also has special powers.  The villains are appropriately cartoonish, and provide most of the impetus for the action.  Ben Kingsley usually shines in roles where he can overact, and that's certainly the case here, playing The Hood.  After the kids assume the spotlight, Bill Paxton as Jeff Tracy, along with his pretty boy sons sit on the bench for most of the film.  Even when they finally get into the action, they are mostly relegated to performing clean up duty.The one absolute bright spot is Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope, and all the accoutrements surrounding her.  Her mod style is a salute to the 60's, and her pink flying car F.A.B. 1, is simply to die for.  Along with her butler Parker (Ron Cook) Lady P provides an adult presence among the good guys, and adds some sex appeal for males of all ages.  Penelope and Parker's big fight with The Hood and his minions is a highlight, as is Penelope's fabulously fashionable wardrobe.Gerry Anderson, the creator of The Thunderbirds series, reportedly was quite disgusted with the film.  Based on what the original series was, it's understandable why he would feel that way, and why dedicated fans are less than impressed.  Unfortunately, The Thunderbirds is something that you might see once, and then consign to that growing group of movies based on TV series, that just got things very wrong.  The Avengers (1998), The Wild Wild West (1999), and Get Smart (2008) are just a few such disasters that come to mind.  To be fair, with colorful special effects, and a story that features kids as the heroes who make adults look like fools, the film probably has some appeal to young children.",3,unfortunately The Thunderbirds feature film is not F.A.B.,1312502400,"08 5, 2011",2011,2932,"['Having', 'seen', 'Thunderbirds', 'kid', '70', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'many', 'fans', 'original', 'series', 'Thunderbirds', '2004', 'clearly', 'not', 'targeted', 'same', 'audience', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'aimed', 'primarily', 'teenage', 'boys', 'who', 'tuned', 'see', 'Thunderbirds', 'performing', 'daring', 'rescue', 'missions', 'actual', 'stars', 'show', 'were', 'cool', 'vehicles', 'Given', 'rocket', 'ships', 'are', 'big', 'deal', 'today', 'making', 'focus', 'movie', 'group', 'kids', 'engaged', 'goofy', 'adventure', 'might', 'make', 'sense', 'However', 'feature', 'film', 'based', 'old', 'TV', 'program', 'niche', 'audience', 'appeal', 'targeted', 'preteen', 'audience', 'who', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'familiar', 'Big', 'Bird', 'Thunderbirds', 'hardly', 'formula', 'success', 'film', 'bombed', 'really', 'surprise.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'impressive', 'updated', 'Thunderbird', 'vehicles', 'look', 'pretty', 'cool', 'however', 'not', 'being', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'storyline', 'concerning', 'three', 'kids', 'who', 'take', 'film', 'villains', 'strike', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'engaging', 'Alan', 'Tracy', 'Brady', 'Corbet', 'across', 'headstrong', 'know', 'Fermat', 'Soren', 'Fulton', 'brainy', 'one', 'who', 'also', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'TinTin', 'Vanessa', 'Hudgens', 'being', 'male', 'affair', 'smart', 'athletic', 'also', 'special', 'powers', 'villains', 'are', 'appropriately', 'cartoonish', 'provide', 'most', 'impetus', 'action', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'usually', 'roles', 'where', 'can', 'overact', 'certainly', 'case', 'here', 'playing', 'Hood', 'kids', 'assume', 'spotlight', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Jeff', 'Tracy', 'pretty', 'boy', 'sons', 'sit', 'bench', 'most', 'film', 'Even', 'when', 'finally', 'get', 'action', 'are', 'mostly', 'relegated', 'performing', 'clean', 'up', 'duty.The', 'one', 'absolute', 'bright', 'spot', 'Sophia', 'Myles', 'Lady', 'Penelope', 'accoutrements', 'surrounding', 'mod', 'style', 'salute', '60', 'pink', 'flying', 'car', 'F.A.B', '1', 'simply', 'die', 'butler', 'Parker', 'Ron', 'Cook', 'Lady', 'P', 'adult', 'presence', 'good', 'guys', 'sex', 'appeal', 'males', 'ages', 'Penelope', 'Parker', 'big', 'fight', 'Hood', 'minions', 'highlight', 'Penelope', 'fabulously', 'fashionable', 'wardrobe.Gerry', 'Anderson', 'creator', 'Thunderbirds', 'series', 'reportedly', 'was', 'quite', 'disgusted', 'film', 'Based', 'what', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'understandable', 'why', 'would', 'feel', 'way', 'why', 'dedicated', 'fans', 'are', 'less', 'impressed', 'Unfortunately', 'Thunderbirds', 'something', 'might', 'see', 'once', 'then', 'consign', 'growing', 'group', 'movies', 'based', 'TV', 'series', 'just', 'got', 'things', 'very', 'wrong', 'Avengers', '1998', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', '1999', 'Get', 'Smart', '2008', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'such', 'disasters', 'come', 'mind', 'be', 'fair', 'colorful', 'special', 'effects', 'story', 'kids', 'heroes', 'who', 'make', 'adults', 'look', 'fools', 'film', 'probably', 'appeal', 'young', 'children']",N/A
624725,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00005JMZA,Trevor Willsmer,"[11, 14]","I've always thought that most huge box-office flops usually have something to recommend them, but after the remake of Around the World in 80 Days and Thunderbirds, I'm beginning to doubt it. For those not familiar, it's based on a puppet show about a family of astronauts who use state of the art rockets, spaceships and subs to rescue people from various disasters (falling bridges, stricken planes, burning buildings, etc) each week. Well, the puppets are gone (replaced by far more lifeless teenagers), and so is the premise - only one ineptly staged rescue and a plot shamelessly ripped off from Spy Kids without any signs of imagination, wit or entertainment. Young Alan Tracey feels left out of all the rescuing we never see the other Traceys do because dad won't let him play with a real rocket until he passes his exams. Grounded on a beautiful tropical island (some punishment!), his chance to shine comes when the rest of the family - a bunch of identikit bleach-blondes who look like a gay neo-Nazi boy band without a single bit of characterisation between them - are stranded in space and he has to have the day by, er, running around the jungle, making a phone call, firing a hose at the inept comedy relief villains and dousing them in gunk for bad measure.The good points are few and far between. One of them is that the film is mostly in focus. The other is they all got to go to the Seychelles, which looks nice.The bad points: where to start? Ben Kingsley's career lowpoint performance? The aforementioned inept comedy relief sidekicks who would disgrace the Children's Film Foundation at its worst? The almost complete lack of action or effects in a $70m sci-fi film? The terrible script, the lifeless direction, the odious moralising? But most of all is the fact that the film is so patronising in every possible way. Forget the life lessons and off the peg sentiment, this is a movie aimed straight at the under-eights by people who know they're making a kid's movie and are constantly talking down to their intended audience, throwing in fifth-rate jokes and routines that would insult most children who had only recently mastered the art of speech. This film could replace being sent to bed early without their dinner as parents' favourite punishment for kids.The biggest flop in British film history (it didn't even cover the cost of prints and marketing), it's just about watchable if only as an object lesson in how NOT to make a summer movie.",1,A new kind of punishment for bad children,1119052800,"06 18, 2005",2005,2469,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'most', 'huge', 'box-office', 'flops', 'usually', 'have', 'something', 'recommend', 'remake', 'World', '80', 'Days', 'Thunderbirds', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'doubt', 'not', 'familiar', 'based', 'puppet', 'show', 'family', 'astronauts', 'who', 'use', 'state', 'art', 'rockets', 'spaceships', 'subs', 'rescue', 'people', 'various', 'disasters', 'falling', 'bridges', 'stricken', 'planes', 'burning', 'buildings', 'etc', 'week', 'Well', 'puppets', 'are', 'gone', 'replaced', 'far', 'more', 'lifeless', 'teenagers', 'so', 'premise', 'only', 'one', 'ineptly', 'staged', 'rescue', 'plot', 'shamelessly', 'ripped', 'off', 'Spy', 'Kids', 'signs', 'imagination', 'wit', 'entertainment', 'Young', 'Alan', 'Tracey', 'feels', 'left', 'rescuing', 'never', 'see', 'other', 'Traceys', 'do', 'dad', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'play', 'real', 'rocket', 'exams', 'Grounded', 'beautiful', 'tropical', 'island', 'punishment', 'chance', 'shine', 'when', 'rest', 'family', 'bunch', 'identikit', 'bleach-blondes', 'who', 'look', 'gay', 'neo-Nazi', 'boy', 'band', 'single', 'bit', 'characterisation', 'are', 'stranded', 'space', 'have', 'day', 'er', 'running', 'jungle', 'making', 'phone', 'call', 'firing', 'hose', 'inept', 'comedy', 'relief', 'villains', 'dousing', 'gunk', 'bad', 'measure.The', 'good', 'points', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'One', 'film', 'mostly', 'focus', 'other', 'got', 'go', 'Seychelles', 'nice.The', 'bad', 'points', 'where', 'start', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'career', 'lowpoint', 'performance', 'aforementioned', 'inept', 'comedy', 'relief', 'sidekicks', 'who', 'would', 'disgrace', 'Children', 'Film', 'Foundation', 'worst', 'almost', 'complete', 'lack', 'action', 'effects', '70m', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'terrible', 'script', 'lifeless', 'direction', 'odious', 'moralising', 'most', 'fact', 'film', 'so', 'patronising', 'possible', 'way', 'Forget', 'life', 'lessons', 'peg', 'sentiment', 'movie', 'aimed', 'straight', 'under-eights', 'people', 'who', 'know', ""'re"", 'making', 'kid', 'movie', 'are', 'constantly', 'talking', 'intended', 'audience', 'throwing', 'fifth-rate', 'jokes', 'routines', 'would', 'insult', 'most', 'children', 'who', 'had', 'only', 'recently', 'mastered', 'art', 'speech', 'film', 'could', 'replace', 'being', 'sent', 'bed', 'early', 'dinner', 'parents', 'favourite', 'punishment', 'kids.The', 'biggest', 'flop', 'British', 'film', 'history', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'cover', 'cost', 'prints', 'marketing', 'just', 'about', 'watchable', 'only', 'object', 'lesson', 'how', 'NOT', 'make', 'summer', 'movie']",N/A
624726,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JMZA,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Two great things about the new film version of UK cult TV series are A) that it has very attractive designs all over, in the style of colorful pop-art in the 60s (though, the film is set in 2020); and B) that it has charming and delightful Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope who should have been the star of the film.But as it is, the three kids are the accidental hero/heroine of the film.  Now, the problem is, the film's production started back in 1995, and before the final release of the film, we have seen such successful films as 'Spy Kids' (and three of it) or 'X-Men' (two), with which the plot of 'Thunderbirds' share may things.  And too many.The original's setting is basically the same (so if you're a fan of the original TV, skip this paragraph).  The rich Tracy family, with its leader/father Bill Paxton, owns their private rescue team whose members are mainly his sons.  They live on  Tracy Island, also a secret base somewhere in the South Pacific, and when a disaster strikes, they go wherever and whenever it is, using their uniquely designed machines Thunderbird 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the last being a space station surveying the Earth.That's the rough sketch of the setting, but this time they cahnged one thing.  Oscar-winner Ben Kingsley plays a villain 'Hood' who has a plan to find the location of the Island, and if he can capture the place, he thinks, he can use it as he wishes, just like any megalomaniac villains would.NOW CRUCIAL POINT IS, in this film, the kids play the central part to save the day, not the regular members of the Tracys.  Three newcomers play Alan Tracy (the youngest of the family who is not yet admitted into the members); Fermat the son of bespectacled, geekish scientist Brains (did he have a son?  I annot rememeber...); and Tintin, who is a relation to the baddie.If you do not care the weakness of the story, too incredible development of the story that includes superhuman powers of reading and controling other people's mind, or the awfully silly motive of the villain (who is, again I say, played by Oscar-winner who wears a brown-colored Oriental gown with a snake), you may like this film.  Yes, I know that kids will take it differently, and they may find it entertaining.  Sorry, but I happen to be a thirty-something adult who had to go out under the scorching sun of August.But not everything is bad, I admit.  As I said, Sophia Myles (seen in 'Underworld') is stunning in pink costume, getting away with every silly line she has to say with charm and grace.  She deserves all the positive reviews, and so do the production designs including the opening animation section, and though some die-hard fans of the original may resent the changes done to the TBs (especially 2 and 4), we should say they paid due respect to Gerry Anderson.But I have to say, Working Title should have made this film earlier, because not many American people know the original (Roger Ebert says he had never heard of it).  And the unlucky similarity of the story with that of 'Spy Kids' and others could be avoided had it been released before 2000.",2,"Great Designs, Charming Sophia Myles, and ...
