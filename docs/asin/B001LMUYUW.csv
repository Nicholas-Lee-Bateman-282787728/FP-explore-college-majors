The characters are lovable and easy to relate to, the stories are easy to follow and the pace is fast moving. The graphics most of the time were fairly up to date for a cartoon. I thought the story lines were good and portrayed the various parables quite well. However, the ending of the stories left a little bit to be desired as far as an explanation. I thought they could have taken a moment at the end to ""debrief"" to make sure the parable really sticks in the minds of children. Otherwise, I thought it was great! Glad to hear they intend to make more episodes covering more parables in the near future. On a side note, the ancillary products that accompany the dvd's as far as plush, etc. are ADORABLE. Great additions to this series.",4,cute,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,845,"['DVD', 'industry', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'cartoons', 'especially', 'religious', 'market', 'DVD', 'cute', 'characters', 'are', 'lovable', 'easy', 'relate', 'stories', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'pace', 'fast', 'moving', 'graphics', 'most', 'time', 'were', 'fairly', 'up', 'date', 'cartoon', 'thought', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'good', 'portrayed', 'various', 'parables', 'quite', 'well', 'However', 'ending', 'stories', 'left', 'little', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'as', 'far', 'explanation', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'moment', 'end', 'debrief', 'make', 'sure', 'parable', 'really', 'sticks', 'minds', 'children', 'Otherwise', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'Glad', 'hear', 'intend', 'make', 'more', 'episodes', 'covering', 'more', 'parables', 'near', 'future', 'side', 'note', 'ancillary', 'products', 'accompany', 'dvd', 'as', 'far', 'plush', 'etc', 'are', 'ADORABLE', 'Great', 'additions', 'series']",Adventures in Booga Booga Land: 'So This is Booga' & Other Episodes
1215258,A2G4Q94HI16FK9,B001LMUYUW,Cart,"[0, 0]","Adventures In Booga Booga Land COULD have been a very cute cartoon and a great resource for teaching your littles the basic understanding of 3 of the great Bible parables.However, all it had was pure silliness and stupidity. The lessons were lost in the midst of a foolish monkey blowing himself up and doing dangerous things without getting hurt one bit...not something I want my children trying to imitate. Name calling and just plain carelessness seemed to be the theme in this video, not learning about the responsible lessons Jesus taught.Hubby and I watched the video ourselves before we would let our children see it, just to make sure it was ok for them. I am glad we did, as it wasn't something we wanted our children to see. (Our standards are high.)I will give it credit though, that the first small cartoon ""So This Is Booga Booga"" wasn't half bad. Not quite as silly and pointless and the lesson was a little easier to catch in there.But unfortunately, I am sorry to have to give a bad review. The rest of the video was a disappointment. The creators seemed to have spent more time trying to entertain with today's mindlessness for children then sharing God's lessons. We were hoping to be able to use this video with our children as a teaching tool. This just didn't work for us.(This DVD was provided by Thomas Nelson Publishers for review purposes.)",2,The Lessons Are Lost In Silliness,1286236800,"10 5, 2010",2010,1365,"['Adventures', 'Booga', 'Booga', 'Land', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'cute', 'cartoon', 'great', 'resource', 'teaching', 'littles', 'basic', 'understanding', '3', 'great', 'Bible', 'parables.However', 'had', 'was', 'pure', 'silliness', 'stupidity', 'lessons', 'were', 'lost', 'midst', 'foolish', 'monkey', 'blowing', 'doing', 'dangerous', 'things', 'getting', 'one', 'bit', 'not', 'something', 'want', 'children', 'trying', 'imitate', 'Name', 'calling', 'just', 'plain', 'carelessness', 'seemed', 'be', 'theme', 'video', 'not', 'learning', 'responsible', 'lessons', 'Jesus', 'taught.Hubby', 'watched', 'video', 'would', 'let', 'children', 'see', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'was', 'ok', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'was', ""n't"", 'something', 'wanted', 'children', 'see', 'standards', 'are', 'high', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'first', 'small', 'cartoon', 'So', 'Booga', 'Booga', 'was', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad', 'Not', 'quite', 'silly', 'pointless', 'lesson', 'was', 'little', 'easier', 'catch', 'there.But', 'unfortunately', 'am', 'sorry', 'have', 'give', 'bad', 'review', 'rest', 'video', 'was', 'disappointment', 'creators', 'seemed', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'trying', 'entertain', 'today', 'mindlessness', 'children', 'then', 'sharing', 'God', 'lessons', 'were', 'hoping', 'be', 'able', 'use', 'video', 'children', 'teaching', 'tool', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'DVD', 'was', 'provided', 'Thomas', 'Nelson', 'Publishers', 'review', 'purposes']",Adventures in Booga Booga Land: 'So This is Booga' & Other Episodes
1215259,ADZGVYAB45SYW,B001LMUYUW,Jenelle Schmidt: KING'S WARRIOR,"[0, 0]","""Adventures in Booga Booga Land"" is a fairly cute kids' cartoon. This DVD includes three short, (15 minute) episodes about a giraffe named Gerard and a monkey named Marty who come to Booga Booga Land and become best friends.Each of the three episodes is based on one of the parables that Jesus tells in the New Testament. The first episode is based on The Workers in the Vineyard (Matthew 20:1-16), The Wise and Foolish Builders (Luke 6:47-49) and The Lamp under a bowl (Matthew 5:14-16).I thought that the first two episodes were pretty well done in terms of script. It was easy to see the parallels between the parables and the antics of Gerard and Marty. However, I don't have any idea why the makers of the DVD chose the Lamp Under the Bowl for the third parable. 1) The actual parable is quite a bit shorter than the others, 2) it's a hard parable to recreate in any tangible sort of way, and 3) the episode felt extremely contrived and it was a bit of a stretch to link it to the parable it was supposed to be based off of. I still can't figure out what the moral of the story was, and I KNOW the answer.Overall, I give it 3 stars because it was cute, entertaining, and my 2 year old enjoyed it, but it's not one we'll watch over and over again.Many thanks to Tommy Nelson publishers who provided this DVD for me to review. They did not ask for a positive review, merely an honest one.",3,Good idea... but lacking in production value,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",2010,1391,"['Adventures', 'Booga', 'Booga', 'Land', 'fairly', 'cute', 'kids', 'cartoon', 'DVD', 'three', 'short', '15', 'minute', 'giraffe', 'named', 'Gerard', 'monkey', 'named', 'Marty', 'who', 'come', 'Booga', 'Booga', 'Land', 'become', 'best', 'friends.Each', 'three', 'episodes', 'based', 'one', 'parables', 'Jesus', 'New', 'Testament', 'first', 'episode', 'based', 'Workers', 'Vineyard', 'Matthew', '20:1-16', 'Wise', 'Foolish', 'Builders', 'Luke', '6:47-49', 'Lamp', 'bowl', 'Matthew', '5:14-16', '.I', 'thought', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'were', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'terms', 'script', 'was', 'easy', 'see', 'parallels', 'parables', 'antics', 'Gerard', 'Marty', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'makers', 'DVD', 'chose', 'Lamp', 'Bowl', 'third', 'parable', '1', 'actual', 'parable', 'quite', 'bit', 'shorter', 'others', '2', 'hard', 'parable', 'recreate', 'tangible', 'sort', 'way', '3', 'episode', 'felt', 'extremely', 'contrived', 'was', 'bit', 'stretch', 'link', 'parable', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'moral', 'story', 'was', 'KNOW', 'answer.Overall', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'was', 'cute', 'entertaining', '2', 'year', 'old', 'enjoyed', 'not', 'one', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'again.Many', 'thanks', 'Tommy', 'Nelson', 'publishers', 'who', 'provided', 'DVD', 'review', 'did', 'not', 'ask', 'positive', 'review', 'merely', 'honest', 'one']",Adventures in Booga Booga Land: 'So This is Booga' & Other Episodes
1215260,ATFRPYKXCCTJX,B001LMUYUW,"Lollipops ""lollipops5""","[0, 0]","ADVENTURES IN BOOGABOOGA LAND is the story about a giraffe named Gerard and a monkey named Marty who met when Marty fell out of an airplane. The two became friends and start looking for a job together.There are three episodes on this DVD, based on three parables.1. ""So This is Booga"" is based on ""The Workers in the Vineyard"" (Matt. 20: 1-16) where Gerard and Mary meet and get hired on as window washers.2. ""Marty's Sandcastle"" is based on ""The Wise and Foolish Builders"" (Matt. 7: 24-27) and is about them taking a construction class, then each building their own house.3. ""No Light in the Lighthouse"" is about ""The Lamp Under the Bowl"" (Matt. 5:14-16) and is about the two friends building a lighthouse.Children will be enthralled by this loveable pair as they do some pretty funny things to reach their goal. Marty is kind of immature and Gerard is the voice of reason, but between the two of them they are really funny.If you are looking for a good DVD that is based on biblical parables, then ADVENTURES IN BOOGABOOGA LAND is the DVD to consider. It is so loosely based that you can show this DVD in the world and no one will be offended by the Bible teachings, yet the stories are similar enough that children will come away with the same truths.My five-year-old says that the DVD is wonderful. My eight-year-old says that some of it is unrealistic. (But then, what cartoon is?)

1215261,A14ULXGPTFGFIU,B001LMUYUW,"Mary G ""Mary G""","[0, 0]","I liked this video.  My kids (7, 10 and 11) thought it was good.  Overall, I'd give it a ""4"" as I think the only thing that's missing is an explanation of the parable just a bit?  In trying to set up the stories, the plots get a bit convoluted and then the kids don't really get the parable connection -- particularly in the third story, the plot lost the point of that particular parable.This dvd includes 3 stories based on the Parables in the Gospel of Matthew:1.  The workers in the vineyard (Matt 20:1-6)2.  The wise and foolish builders (Matt 7:24-27)3.  The lamp under the bowl (Matt 5:14-16)The animation in this one is good -- much better than I've seen lately with kids' cartoons (especially since so many are relying on computer graphics which always look ... funny!).  The sound is good (except the woman in one sounded like a man trying to be a woman???)  The music is great -- not grating on my nerves and the kids liked it.Overall I think this is a great DVD to watch with your kids.  A great teachable moment when each episode is done!-----Disclaimer:  I received this dvd from Book Sneeze with the requirement that I write a review.
