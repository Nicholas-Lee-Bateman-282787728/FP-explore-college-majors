1570642,A3UWYCISNFHO2X,B008MZJ2GI,albarino,"[18, 75]","The Last Ounce of Courage, is a stylized story about a so-called US patriot named Revere, not the 18th century Boston silversmith  -- but a contemporary character, who, as an Army sergeant in Viet Nam risked his life in combat. As the story unfolds, the bitter and reclusive Revere becomes motivated to undertake  a new fight against America's ""enemies within,"" and ""reclaim freedoms that are being lost.""TLOoC is a poorly structured, cliche-scripted and clumsily acted film. Most of the characters are types, not real characters, always the sign of a film gone awry. It does have a few touching moments such as when Revere Jr. enlists for the Iraq War of 1990 (I think - it is unclear which theatre he is stationed), leaves his family, and at the end, when the family comes together -- although the conclusion offers little surprises. TLOoC is in the genre of the Hallmark Hall of Fame family-friendly TV dramas, but with none of the latter's professionalism.Nevertheless, the far right wing has come out to endorse TLOoC, including the extremist James Dobson, founder of the American Family Association, and the NRA, who also support military style assault weapons with high capacity ammo clips, like those that riddled the bodies of school children at Newton, Connecticutt.The movie starts when Revere, Sr, who is signaled to the viewer as ""an American hero,"" a Harley-Davidson riding veteran with colors, the archetype of white male freedom and individualism. In case you missed the point, he sports a huge American Flag waving behind his bike  and is at the center of the plot of TLOoC. In the standard patriotic mythology of the white far right wing, he served in Viet Nam where he won medals rescuing POWs - a Rambo variation -- though one mission went fatally bad and he is haunted by it. Revere Sr.  has a son who grows up, marries and enlists to fight the first Gulf War (I think), a call of duty that entails him leaving behind a new and pregnant wife. Revere Jr. is killed in an attack, and this somehow got videotaped. When the tape is returned to the family it is viewed and this stuns/grieves them, later calling them to action. Thereafter, the father and daughter-in-law  grow somewhat apart.Some years later, Revere Sr. connects with the family Revere Jr. left behind. Finding his grandson, he performs the right wing ritual of familial inheritance, sharing - a bit reluctantly - his prize possessions to the boy.  He gives his son's Gideon Bible (here a textual fundamentalist paladin like the Ark of the Convenant. Didn't anyone have an NIV?) that the grandson's father carried with him in Iraq.  The boy takes these items to school, where a twittish principal (a symbol of un-masculine secular authority - a familiar right wing caricature) is indignant that this ""unacceptable text,"" was brought to school. He threatens suspension of the grandson but goes easy on him telling him to not violate the school's ""Bible ban."" After that, the plot thickens. (In the real world, there is nothing to prevent high schoolers from bringing their Bibles to school for their own use - but that doesn't matter to the writer of TLOoC.)Grandfather Revere, who is now the part-time mayor of the small town, learns about this incident and concludes a conspiracy is afoot to undermine our precious freedoms.  He recalls that the city cannot celebrate Christmas now with public displays of the Nativity and Christian crosses like they once used to display. He concludes that a small minority of ""fanatics"" stopped some 85% of ""true American citizens"" (a statistic cited via Fox News commentator Bill O' Reilly in the film) from observing Christmas, as if Nativity displays on public property are appropriate Christian worship. He becomes convinced that he fought a war for this right and now it is being ""taken away"" from him -- i.e. he ""wants his country back."" The annual Fox News ""War on Christmas"" get its own film and Revere re-names the town ""Christmas City!""Revere Sr. then encounters an enemy (read, right wing scapegoat) against his efforts to set up Christmas decorations around the town: Fred Hammersmith, a militant ACLU type, and perhaps the most ineptly drawn figure in the film. All TLOoC needs is for on-screen prompts to boo him whenever he appears. Revere Sr. the mayor, also acquired a government grant to build a home for disabled veterans. However, Hammersmith and his liberal allies try to block the use of these funds because of the Revere's pro-Christmas actions. In a classic plot turn in the white fundamentalist nationalist myth of resurgence, our hero decides he has had enough. With stern resolve, and the help of his grandson, Revere Sr. hauls an illuminate cross in the vintage pickup that the deceased Revere Jr. was to inherit (a classic Salvation Army model - ""Jesus Saves"") and raises it on the highest place of a private town building -- an act of REVERE-ance? It was apparently removed when someone complained about it awhile back. Excuse me here, a cross on private property is no one's business. In an act of vigilantism -- and without the building owner's permission -- Revere Sr. & grandson install the illuminate cross on the face of the building. For his pains, the mayor is handcuffed, arrested and taken to jail, but not until having a bonding embrace with his grandson.Taking a page from the Book of Acts, an ""angel""/""Christ"" comforts/inspires the mayor in jail, preceding his release. This curious figure looks a little like a middle-age Jesus if Our Lord were a ""silver fox"" and favored country and western garb. Meanwhile the local school where the grandson was harassed is about to stage a ""holiday play,"" using a non-Christian ""New Age"" theme. But, in a plot turn, the actor/students rebel and have garbed themselves in costumes from the characters in the Nativity story, beneath their ""pagan"" costumes. In vindictive triumph, they cast off their intended costumes and present the ""true story"" of Christmas, the Nativity Scene with recited Gospel text.  The angry principal storms onto the stage, scolding the students, but then sees that the audience has been moved by the Christmas play and ends up applauding it.What really galled me was the fusing of Christianity with American nationalism/patriotism (a heresy, by the way). The crowd stands and an American flag (here an object of worship) is brought out, blocking the baby Jesus in His manger!! A veteran in the crowd and all present stand to salute the flag. Someone screens Revere Jr's last video for the crowd and there isn't a dry eye in the house. This prompts the mayor/hero to declare that he will become a ""freedom fighter"" to combat the enemies who seek to undermine the traditions and freedom of the country he fought for.  In this emotional nationalist incident the salvation of America has begun in the town's resistance.In conclusion, TLOoC is a classic piece of white far right wing mythology -- with a predictable script and godawful acting. It is, however, an excellent example of the resentment the the white far right wing feels against a vague enemy in this period of transition. Go the website Rottentomatoes.com, a forum for film reviews.

1570679,A2B0DPQK20LYYJ,B008MZJ2GI,J. Michael,"[1, 6]","In the small American town portrayed in this film, there are unwritten rules that forbid bringing the Bible into the public school and displaying Christmas decorations in the town square. The mayor is inspired by his late son (who died in the first Gulf War) and his grandson to stand up against the enemies of freedom who are denying religious expression to the majority. A few observations:#1 There_is_a social and legal war on Christianity in the United States. If Obama's healthcare mandate isn't religious persecution, then that term has no meaning. However, the obstacles faced by the protagonists in this film don't amount to any sort of persecution. They are the products of some evangelical's overactive imagination.No one is forbidden to bring a Bible into a public school. And the Supreme Court has ruled that government_can_display Christmas decorations on public property so long as the symbols and decorations of other religions or philosophies are represented as well.Now, I don't like that arrangement; I don't want to see the menorah or the Islamic crescent or the atheist atom set up in equality next to the Cross or the creche. That's sacrilege to me. But we can't ignore the First Amendment, which forbids establishment of religion by government.If, throughout most of American history, a homogeneously Christian country was perfectly comfortable with a government that violated the Constitution by favoring a generic version of Christianity (with a Protestant tinge), then that time has passed, as we now have a new nation. First, we let the Jews in, and the Moslems, Buddhists, Hindus and Confucianists, while tolerating atheists as well, and they all have a great legal case, based on the First Amendment, when they object to Christian favoritism by government. If you don't like that, then you should either abolish the Establishment clause of the First Amendment, or figure out some way to get the Jews, Moslems, et al out of the country.Because a Moslem or Jew has the same rights as any other American citizen, it is quite legally sound to forbid Bible readings at a high school graduation, or a Christmas pageant in grade school. How would you like it if you, as a student in a majority Moslem school, had to listen to someone reciting from the Koran at assembly? We allowed our politicians to foist a multicultural society upon us. Now we have to live with the consequences.In any case, this movie's premise was completely ridiculous. What it amounted to was Christians finding out that they are allowed to express their faith in public. That is not the real problem today. What the filmmakers should have tackled was the real legal persecution of Christians in America, such as Obama forcing the Catholic Church to pay for contraception and abortifacients for its employees, against its beliefs; or how bakers, photographers, etc. are being successfully sued because they didn't want to provide their services for a gay wedding.#2.

They don't read the bible and pray. This family lost their son while he was serving our country. They were distraught and frankly a little lost. Even though the patriarch served honorably, he had even lost some sense of patriotism. He became reminded of what he believed in and finally decided to take a stand for freedom again.

What a great family movie.This is a movie that must be seen again and again by entire families in order to put things in perspective and to remind everybody where we are coming from. The movie starts and ends we two powerful quotes from Ronald Reagan.It is about a family that lost their son in a recent war and is living a peaceful life without realizing that they have given up their everyday rights and freedom that many soldiers in this great country have died for. Suddenly they realize that slowly they are giving up their rights and they fight all together to restore their right to celebrate Christmas (...for starters). The secular media and ACLU are fighting back (...as is the case today) with a lot of nonsense. While the end is predictable it is a good and positive ending with a great message of hope.After watching the movie I realized that there is a character in the movie that looks like he came straight out of a ZZ Top video that appears in the background in some scenes. I watched the movie again looking for this character and indeed the character was there...At the very end of the movie we get the message. Thank You for being there for us!Five stars because of the last 30 minutes of the movie and because of the powerful message...and Merry Christmas!,5,Wake up! Stand up for what you believe!
