572753,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B000059H96,Austin Somlo,"[0, 3]","Viewed: 10/10Rate: 310/10: Since the premise of Boxing Helena mostly takes place in a dream, where is the controversy? How stupid of the critics. Anyone can imagine anything in her/his dream. That's why it's called a dream. Anyway, the movie is terrible and boring. It reeked too much of David Lynch wannabe. Understandably, it was in the hands of her daughter, but ever heard of originality? That's David Lynch's style and nobody else's. Eventually, her career rightfully fell apart. The acting by the cast was all right, and nobody really made a difference. The story and the pacing were the major problems; it was just not interesting, and things moved slow for me. Sherilyn Fenn, more recognizable for her work in Two Moon Junction, seems to have the knack for this type of films, so I guess the genre suits her very well. It depends on the director for maximizing her potential. Julian Sands, usually a better actor than he was in this dreck, couldn't save it either. Bill Paxton looked like a fool with that silly hairdo and muscle shirts. Can you say ""overacting?"" I knew the movie fell apart as soon as I saw the aftermath of the truck accident with Helena. There is just absolutely no way anyone could have survived that without proper medical care including I.V.s, blood transfusion, and all the fancy hospital equipments. Another part that mystified me about Julian Sands' character was the ear mold in his ear. Was that a bad Marlon Brando trick where he tries to receive his lines from an assistant? Also, it is just hard for me to accept that given Julian Sands' looks, he couldn't be able to score with many women as good looking as he. That's also why Boxing Helena fell apart for me. The aspects of the story never got put together in a sensible way for me; there was a lot of revelations about Dr. Cavanaugh, but no explanations. Instead, they all became random characteristics. Meanwhile, the only good thing going for the film is that it had a nice cinematography, already too typical of David Lynch films. I guess the daughter used his usual crew? All in all, Boxing Helena didn't work that well for me.",2,Jennifer is a David Lynch Wannabe.,1286496000,"10 8, 2010",2010,2124,"['Viewed', '10/10Rate', '310/10', 'premise', 'Boxing', 'Helena', 'mostly', 'place', 'dream', 'where', 'controversy', 'How', 'stupid', 'critics', 'Anyone', 'can', 'imagine', 'anything', 'her/his', 'dream', 'why', 'called', 'dream', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'terrible', 'boring', 'reeked', 'too', 'much', 'David', 'Lynch', 'wannabe', 'Understandably', 'was', 'hands', 'daughter', 'ever', 'heard', 'originality', 'David', 'Lynch', 'style', 'nobody', 'else', 'Eventually', 'career', 'rightfully', 'fell', 'apart', 'acting', 'cast', 'was', 'right', 'nobody', 'really', 'made', 'difference', 'story', 'pacing', 'were', 'major', 'problems', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'things', 'moved', 'slow', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'more', 'recognizable', 'work', 'Two', 'Moon', 'Junction', 'have', 'knack', 'type', 'films', 'guess', 'genre', 'suits', 'very', 'well', 'director', 'maximizing', 'potential', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'usually', 'better', 'actor', 'was', 'dreck', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'looked', 'fool', 'silly', 'hairdo', 'muscle', 'shirts', 'Can', 'say', 'overacting', 'knew', 'movie', 'fell', 'apart', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'aftermath', 'truck', 'accident', 'Helena', 'just', 'absolutely', 'way', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'proper', 'medical', 'care', 'including', 'I.V.s', 'blood', 'transfusion', 'fancy', 'hospital', 'equipments', 'part', 'mystified', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'character', 'was', 'ear', 'mold', 'ear', 'Was', 'bad', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'trick', 'where', 'receive', 'lines', 'assistant', 'Also', 'just', 'hard', 'accept', 'given', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'looks', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'score', 'many', 'women', 'good', 'looking', 'also', 'why', 'Boxing', 'Helena', 'fell', 'apart', 'aspects', 'story', 'never', 'got', 'put', 'together', 'sensible', 'way', 'was', 'lot', 'revelations', 'Dr.', 'Cavanaugh', 'explanations', 'Instead', 'became', 'random', 'characteristics', 'Meanwhile', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'going', 'film', 'had', 'nice', 'cinematography', 'already', 'too', 'typical', 'David', 'Lynch', 'films', 'guess', 'daughter', 'used', 'usual', 'crew', 'Boxing', 'Helena', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'well']",N/A

572760,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000059H96,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 5]","""Boxing Helena"" is directed by the daughter of David Lynch, Jennifer Chambers Lynch. This is the only reason I wanted to see this movie. I always get curious when the offspring of a filmmaker decides to follow in their parents footsteps, but when it's the offspring of one of my favorite directors...That only makes it more interesting. And ""Boxing Helena"" is an interesting movie, very much in the vein of a David Lynch film. This film deals with dreams, sexual obsession, and a whole jubilee of weirdness. Watching the film, it amazed me that a woman wrote it. This film feels like it's written by a man, which I'll explain in a moment. The movie is about a doctor named Nick Cavanaugh (Julian Sands), who clearly has a few screws loose. He's got a beautiful girlfriend and, after the death of his mother, a mansion. But there's one thing he doesn't have and that is Helena (Sherilyn Fenn, 'Of Mice & Men'). Nick harbors a full-on obsession for Helena, a woman he had a one-night stand with and can't stop thinking about. He even climbs the tree outside her window to spy into her room. Warned by a fellow doctor/friend (Art Garfunkel) not to mess with her, Nick invites her to a party only to have his ego crushed when she leaves with another man. Fate steps in, however, when she leaves her purse at the party and Nick creates circumstances that cause her to come to his house and get it. While leaving his house, Helena is hit by a car and Nick is forced to perform emergency surgery to save her. He amputates her legs. Now Helena, legless and helpless, is trapped in Nick's house (think of it as ""Misery"" in reverse). Besides not letting her go and amputating her body parts, Nick doesn't harm her. The man loves Helena and doesn't want to hurt her, but simply wants her to have feelings for him too. What it is he sees in Helena isn't really made obvious. Besides beauty, there's not much going for her. She's rude, narcissistic, and cold. Anyway, the remainder of the film consists of Nick trying to keep Helena for himself while her boyfriend Ray (Bill Paxton, doing some of the worst acting he's ever done) looks for her. The ending is contrived and too reminiscent of earlier and later David Lynch films. The films weakness is both the ending and Paxton and the director's decision to use soft-core porn music for her score. There are also a few scenes that look like outtakes from ""Wild Orchid."" Meanwhile, you have Bill Paxton acting like he had never done so. His facial expressions and the way he recites his dialogue in this film is bad. I don't know if you can call it overacting, but it's definitely bad acting. Other than that, the acting is solid. Sands is a good casting choice, because he really portrays how pathetic and lonely this character is. Fenn is good too, making the character easy to hate without making us hate her too much. My only other complaint is the DVD. No subtitles and the audio track is less than spectacular. There's a lot of whispering in the movie (a lot of yelling, though, too) and subtitles would've been nice. Since this is the only film Lynch has directed, it's hard to say what she could accomplish if she made more movies. But this film shows her as a promising young talent, whose biggest mistake was drawing a little too much inspiration from daddy.GRADE: B",4,Boxing Helena,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,3313,"['Boxing', 'Helena', 'directed', 'daughter', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Jennifer', 'Chambers', 'Lynch', 'only', 'reason', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'always', 'get', 'curious', 'when', 'offspring', 'filmmaker', 'follow', 'parents', 'footsteps', 'when', 'offspring', 'one', 'favorite', 'directors', 'only', 'more', 'interesting', 'Boxing', 'Helena', 'interesting', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'vein', 'David', 'Lynch', 'film', 'film', 'deals', 'dreams', 'sexual', 'obsession', 'whole', 'jubilee', 'weirdness', 'Watching', 'film', 'amazed', 'woman', 'wrote', 'film', 'feels', 'written', 'man', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'moment', 'movie', 'doctor', 'named', 'Nick', 'Cavanaugh', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'who', 'clearly', 'few', 'screws', 'loose', 'got', 'beautiful', 'girlfriend', 'death', 'mother', 'mansion', 'one', 'thing', ""n't"", 'have', 'Helena', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', ""'Of"", 'Mice', 'Men', 'Nick', 'full-on', 'obsession', 'Helena', 'woman', 'had', 'one-night', 'stand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'thinking', 'about', 'even', 'tree', 'window', 'spy', 'room', 'Warned', 'fellow', 'doctor/friend', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'not', 'mess', 'Nick', 'party', 'only', 'have', 'ego', 'crushed', 'when', 'man', 'Fate', 'steps', 'however', 'when', 'purse', 'party', 'Nick', 'circumstances', 'cause', 'come', 'house', 'get', 'leaving', 'house', 'Helena', 'hit', 'car', 'Nick', 'forced', 'perform', 'emergency', 'surgery', 'save', 'legs', 'Now', 'Helena', 'legless', 'helpless', 'trapped', 'Nick', 'house', 'think', 'Misery', 'reverse', 'not', 'letting', 'go', 'amputating', 'body', 'parts', 'Nick', ""n't"", 'harm', 'man', 'Helena', ""n't"", 'want', 'hurt', 'simply', 'have', 'feelings', 'too', 'What', 'Helena', ""n't"", 'really', 'made', 'obvious', 'beauty', 'not', 'much', 'going', 'rude', 'narcissistic', 'cold', 'Anyway', 'remainder', 'film', 'Nick', 'trying', 'keep', 'Helena', 'boyfriend', 'Ray', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'doing', 'worst', 'acting', 'ever', 'done', 'ending', 'contrived', 'too', 'reminiscent', 'earlier', 'later', 'David', 'Lynch', 'films', 'films', 'weakness', 'ending', 'Paxton', 'director', 'decision', 'use', 'soft-core', 'porn', 'music', 'score', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'scenes', 'look', 'outtakes', 'Wild', 'Orchid', 'Meanwhile', 'have', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'acting', 'had', 'never', 'done', 'so', 'facial', 'expressions', 'way', 'dialogue', 'film', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'call', 'overacting', 'definitely', 'bad', 'acting', 'Other', 'acting', 'solid', 'Sands', 'good', 'casting', 'choice', 'really', 'how', 'pathetic', 'lonely', 'character', 'Fenn', 'good', 'too', 'making', 'character', 'easy', 'hate', 'making', 'hate', 'too', 'much', 'only', 'other', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'subtitles', 'audio', 'track', 'less', 'spectacular', 'lot', 'whispering', 'movie', 'lot', 'yelling', 'though', 'too', 'subtitles', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'only', 'film', 'Lynch', 'directed', 'hard', 'say', 'what', 'could', 'accomplish', 'made', 'more', 'movies', 'film', 'promising', 'young', 'talent', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'was', 'drawing', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'inspiration', 'daddy.GRADE', 'B']",N/A

Worse, is it wrong to love him when he's being evil at the same time?If it is, then I have received ample punishment in watching this.Boxing Helena is a movie that desperately wants to be a dark, edgy,arty comment on obsessive love.  Not just that, it makes weak use of the themes of how beauty is defined, the power struggle between the sexes and how women are regarded in relation to sex.This is what we know of Nick Cavanaugh - he is a spineless, whiny, slightly hypochondriacal(the roots of which are never really explained)yet wealthy and successful surgeon with Mommy issues. Aside from a few flashbacks, there's really no explanation why this has translated into such an overpowering lust and obsession with Helena in particular.We know even less about Helena, and it becomes a slight to a story that appears to want to make a statement on how beautiful and strong willed women (read: bitchy and evil)are punished for behaving exactly as a man would. Her character is not even considered worthy enough to be more than totally one dimensional.So we have Nick, sexually obsessed and hopelessly infatuated with a woman who will have nothing to do with him; a woman he can only truly love and control by making her powerless-a real life Venus. And Helena, beautiful and cruel, a woman who doesn't really love until she has some of what made her a woman taken from her.I cringe at the thought that some of the people watching this thought they were finding a ""message"" somewhere in this mess.Had this movie been well written it probably would have been insightful and disturbing. But it fails on so many levels that it ends up just being boring.

572767,A3FOSBM4MMUFER,B000059H96,Randal J. Batty,"[2, 3]","By reading the other reviews, you'll gather this film is not for everyone.  I owned this on VHS tape and decided to buy the DVD -- primarily because I think it will be unobtainable in the future.  The underlying theme (as I see it) is the unsuccessful attempt of one man to capture and possess beauty -- in the form of a female form.  Men perceive beauty in various manifestations -- a colorful sunset, a field of fresh flowers, reflections on a body of water, etc.  Included in this catalog is the beauty of women.  Non-rationalizing men will misinterpret this attraction to beauty as a sexual magnet.  The protagonist of the film is not of this ilk.  He is mild, sensitive, caring, attentive, but at the same time totally unconscious of his impossible desires to isolate beauty as if it were a statue.  He does everything he can to discard the troublesome aspects to his imagination -- wherein one will read of all the horrific undertakings (as posted by many others).  But, these horrors are merely symbolic.  The thrust of the protagonist's motivations revolve around his unconscious desires to obtain and hold mastery over the essence of beauty (however truncated).  He has no inkling that beauty is elusive, intangible, something that stirs the soul but cannot be subject to possession.  (Spoiler)  The entire events are revealed to be nothing but a dream, taking the movie out of the realm of mere horror and firmly placing it into a psychological mind-exercise.  The film is bound to be misinterpreted/misrepresented because most viewers will not grasp the element of the male psyche as interpreting all obstacles to his longings as mere physical impediments (albeit in perhaps an overly graphic, realistic manner).  The film triple-underscores this terrible shortcoming in the male unconscious -- something that must be brought to his full awareness for the sake of any/all viable male-female relationships.  Because of the inherent complexity of the subtext, the movie will probably only be appreciated by symbolists and intellectuals.",4,Boxing Helena - The Impossibility of Capturing Beauty,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,2045,"['reading', 'other', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'gather', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'owned', 'VHS', 'tape', 'decided', 'buy', 'DVD', 'primarily', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'unobtainable', 'future', 'underlying', 'theme', 'see', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'one', 'man', 'capture', 'possess', 'beauty', 'form', 'female', 'form', 'Men', 'perceive', 'beauty', 'various', 'manifestations', 'colorful', 'sunset', 'field', 'fresh', 'flowers', 'reflections', 'body', 'water', 'etc', 'Included', 'catalog', 'beauty', 'women', 'Non-rationalizing', 'men', 'will', 'misinterpret', 'attraction', 'beauty', 'sexual', 'magnet', 'protagonist', 'film', 'not', 'ilk', 'mild', 'sensitive', 'caring', 'attentive', 'same', 'time', 'totally', 'unconscious', 'impossible', 'desires', 'isolate', 'beauty', 'were', 'statue', 'everything', 'can', 'discard', 'troublesome', 'aspects', 'imagination', 'wherein', 'one', 'will', 'read', 'horrific', 'undertakings', 'posted', 'many', 'others', 'horrors', 'are', 'merely', 'symbolic', 'thrust', 'protagonist', 'motivations', 'revolve', 'unconscious', 'desires', 'obtain', 'hold', 'mastery', 'essence', 'beauty', 'however', 'truncated', 'inkling', 'beauty', 'elusive', 'intangible', 'something', 'soul', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'subject', 'possession', 'Spoiler', 'entire', 'events', 'are', 'revealed', 'be', 'nothing', 'dream', 'taking', 'movie', 'realm', 'mere', 'horror', 'firmly', 'placing', 'psychological', 'mind-exercise', 'film', 'bound', 'be', 'misinterpreted/misrepresented', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'grasp', 'element', 'male', 'psyche', 'interpreting', 'obstacles', 'longings', 'mere', 'physical', 'impediments', 'perhaps', 'overly', 'graphic', 'realistic', 'manner', 'film', 'triple-underscores', 'terrible', 'shortcoming', 'male', 'unconscious', 'something', 'must', 'be', 'brought', 'full', 'awareness', 'sake', 'any/all', 'viable', 'male-female', 'relationships', 'inherent', 'complexity', 'subtext', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'only', 'be', 'appreciated', 'symbolists', 'intellectuals']",N/A

When she has a terrible accident outside his house he operates immediatly, amputating her legs and later her arms.The storyline Is I think somewhat disturbing, and may have had potential, but It just wasnt pulled off. The dialouge is very questionable, It was particularly funny when Nick says to Helena ""You're sick"" um...shes not the one cutting off peoples limbs! The flick looks and sounds like any cheap b grade film you'd find made in the eighties or early nineties. Also the basis of Nicks obsession is never explained, aside from the obvious, Helena (Sherilyn Fenn) is stunning, we are never given any reason, Nick already has a decent and nice girlfriend, and Helena treats him worse then a dog, the logic just isnt there!Performance wise, Sherilyn Fenn is great, well as good as one could be with the material given. Julian Sands, I thought he was terrible, couldnt take his accent seriously, might have had something to do with his dialouge ""but Helena I LOVE you!"" every god damned five minutes.Interesting at best, worth watching for the mystical and beautiful Sherilyn Fenn.

Philippe Caland and Jennifer Lynch presented a genuinely interesting and bold plot, that of a masochistic, mother-obsessed doctor (Nick) who desperately latches onto Helena, a beautiful temptress who wants nothing to do with him.  Nick, after having inherited his mother's palatial estate and running into Helena in a bar, decides to throw an impromptu house warming party as cover for inviting Helena into his home where she yet again rebuffs his advances.  Nick then lures her back to his house where she is accidentally hit by a car and has her legs horrible crushed.  Being a brilliant surgeon, Nick manages to save her life though he amputates both of her legs, and it's at this point that the film becomes both remarkable and lackluster at the same time.Jennifer Lynch, daughter of filmmaker David Lynch, seems as if she's taking a page out of her father's surreal dream-logic filmmaking book as Nick keeps Helena prisoner and begins to slowly and literally deconstruct Helena limb by limb until she's truly an object of his desire.  Helena, on the other hand, spends her time digging into Nick's psyche, taunting his manhood and in a very demented twist, falling in love with him, I believe based purely on his desire for her, which transcends physical beauty (something she is used to men fawning over.)  Unfortunately this second act is severely hampered by pointless complexity (in terms of the number of characters in the film) and some very forced and unconvincing performances (namely by Bill Paxton who's trying his best to invoke his character Sevren from Near Dark and Sherilyn Fenn whose stoicism is almost laughable.)Though the acting is generally bad and the directing generic, the plot would save this otherwise mundane film, but this to is thrashed by a very trite and gutless third act that ends with an ambiguous twist ending, which implies that the entire second act was either a hallucination or a dream.  2 stars for the plot, but only two because it was handled terribly.",2,Totally gutless on the follow through...,1178150400,"05 3, 2007",2007,2112,"['Boxing', 'Helena', 'perfect', 'example', 'potential-wasting', 'gutless', 'filmmaking', 'Warning', 'spoilers', 'follow', 'Philippe', 'Caland', 'Jennifer', 'Lynch', 'presented', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'bold', 'plot', 'masochistic', 'mother-obsessed', 'doctor', 'Nick', 'who', 'desperately', 'Helena', 'beautiful', 'temptress', 'who', 'nothing', 'do', 'Nick', 'having', 'inherited', 'mother', 'palatial', 'estate', 'running', 'Helena', 'bar', 'throw', 'impromptu', 'house', 'warming', 'party', 'cover', 'inviting', 'Helena', 'home', 'where', 'yet', 'again', 'rebuffs', 'advances', 'Nick', 'then', 'back', 'house', 'where', 'accidentally', 'hit', 'car', 'legs', 'horrible', 'crushed', 'Being', 'brilliant', 'surgeon', 'Nick', 'save', 'life', 'legs', 'point', 'film', 'remarkable', 'lackluster', 'same', 'time.Jennifer', 'Lynch', 'daughter', 'filmmaker', 'David', 'Lynch', 'taking', 'page', 'father', 'surreal', 'dream-logic', 'filmmaking', 'book', 'Nick', 'Helena', 'prisoner', 'slowly', 'literally', 'deconstruct', 'Helena', 'limb', 'limb', 'truly', 'object', 'desire', 'Helena', 'other', 'hand', 'time', 'digging', 'Nick', 'psyche', 'taunting', 'manhood', 'very', 'demented', 'twist', 'falling', 'love', 'believe', 'based', 'purely', 'desire', 'physical', 'beauty', 'something', 'used', 'men', 'fawning', 'Unfortunately', 'second', 'act', 'severely', 'hampered', 'pointless', 'complexity', 'terms', 'number', 'characters', 'film', 'very', 'forced', 'unconvincing', 'performances', 'namely', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'who', 'trying', 'best', 'invoke', 'character', 'Sevren', 'Near', 'Dark', 'Sherilyn', 'Fenn', 'stoicism', 'almost', 'laughable', 'acting', 'generally', 'bad', 'directing', 'generic', 'plot', 'would', 'save', 'otherwise', 'mundane', 'film', 'thrashed', 'very', 'trite', 'gutless', 'third', 'act', 'ambiguous', 'twist', 'ending', 'entire', 'second', 'act', 'was', 'hallucination', 'dream', '2', 'stars', 'plot', 'only', 'two', 'was', 'handled', 'terribly']",N/A

I really won't even try now, but just say that I really like this movie and I'm not sure why.  It's reputation as a lousy film is almost legendary.  Of course when you consider Michael Bay's filmography, you might want to re-evaluate this movie, or maybe not.Julian Sands(an actor I love) is a rich surgeon obsessed with a woman he had a one nighter with.  The woman, Helena, is played by Sherilyn Fenn, so it's easy to understand his obsession.  However, Helena is a crass, mean, all around unpleasant woman who's on the search solely for boytoys.  Julian's attempts to lure her in result in her being hit by a car.  He now has the perfect opportunity to posses her as he brings her back to his home and begins a process of dismembering her.  Julian quits his job and cuts off communication with his friends, even dumping his girlfriend so he can take care of Helena.  She throws endless insults at him, screams at him, belittles him, and it makes you wonder just what it is that he's so in love with.  Psychological games are played out between the two, and soon some sex is thrown into the mix(Sands brings home one of his tasty looking nurses and makes Helena watch him have sex with her to everybody's favorite Enigma song, Sadness Part 1).  Meanwhile, Helena's sortaboyfriend, Bill Paxton, is trying to find out what happened to her.  Now, this plot may sound kinda grim and gruesome, but it really isn't quite as demented as you'd think.  I don't know why, but the movie sort of reminds me of one of those softcore Skinemax type movies even though there isn't much sex in it.  Sands gives a decent performance, but his character is such a pathetic, whiny, lovestruck schmuck that you just wish you could reach into the tv and smack him one.  As usual, Fenn will make your eyes bug out like something from a Looney Tunes cartoon.  Yummy!!  Apparently Madonna was originally supposed to have this role, and then the role went to Kim Basinger after Madonna dropped out.  Personally I'm glad neither of them got it coz Fenn's my baby.So no, I can't honestly recommend this movie to people coz the numbers say you might not care much for this one.

Witness the popularity of fascinating train wrecks like Crimes of Passion, Hudson Hawk and Last Action Hero, each infinitely more entertaining in their own way than a truckload of Oscar-winners. There are few pleasures to rival the completely sedentary evening spent with your most sardonic friends cackling like freshmen on hallucinogens at movies like Boxing Helena.Boxing Helena turned out to be one of the most hilarious 104 minutes of 1993. The initial buzz that surrounded the film -- insistently referring to it as ""bound to be controversial""-- all but assassinated any potential audience this uproarious trash may have had to begin with. It was said that people who actually saw it tried to get their money back from embarrassed, albeit non-budging, theater managers. But for lovers of Bad Movies, owning the film is a whole other story. When you pop this into the DVD player at home with friends, you welcome the ridiculous plot and anticipate the ludicrous transformation Sherilynn Fenn will go through. Furthermore, Helena takes itself so seriously that we can only respond with gales of derisive crowing.Fenn plays a convincing man-eating b-tch who makes the mistake of sleeping (just once) with Julian Sands, a prominent surgeon, and obviously some sort of thumbsucking psycho whose mother used to parade around the house naked. Obsessed with Fenn, although she'd rather be bulldozed by a speeding truck than speak with him, Sands climbs a tree to spy on her in her bedroom, makes covert phone calls, and eventually throws a party for her. She comes, dances in the fountain (no kidding, our favorite scene) and, natch, leaves with another guy. This gets our flipped-out doc all steamed up and, apparently, sends him over the edge.Soon enough, kismet strikes. Party-girl Fenn gets bulldozed by a speeding truck right outside Sands's estate, and the next thing we know she wakes up without legs in his mansion. Not in the best of moods, she berates him, screams her head off and throws anything she can get her hands on across the room. Can't have that, Sands concludes, and soon she's armless too, which is revealed to us when he's spoonfeeding her. ""I have just one question..."" she begins with a straight face. Just try to stem the reflex to ask -- for her -- ""Where the hell are my arms?""As improbable as it may seem, she grows to love him (sure, We'd fall in love with someone who cut off our arms and legs, too). That does not, however, stop her incessant talking, and we can only presume that Sands would have gotten around to cutting her head off as well, if the movie hadn't ended first. Fenn and Sands are both hopelessly earnest, while the supporting cast either has a superb handle on this nonsense (witness Bill Paxton's shag-haired rock stud) or seems to have wandered in off the street: Art Garfunkel, as Sands's pal, sits around in a silent daze as if someone told him Paul Simon was supposed to show up.This is the movie that Kim Basinger had to fight like heck to get out of, not to mention cough up a hefty fine -- the best few mil she ever spent. As for writer/director Jennifer Lynch, (weirdo daughter of David), the 23-year-old director, who posed for press shots in front of the Venus de Milo and talked about how we're all in our own boxes, you've got to give it to her -- at least she makes us laugh --  if not with her.",5,THE MOST UNINTENTIONALLY HILARIOUS 104 MINUTES OF 1993!,1185667200,"07 29, 2007",2007,3403,"['Everyone', 'good', 'smoking', 'ruin', 'movie', 'popularity', 'fascinating', 'train', 'wrecks', 'Crimes', 'Passion', 'Hudson', 'Hawk', 'Last', 'Action', 'Hero', 'infinitely', 'more', 'entertaining', 'own', 'way', 'truckload', 'Oscar-winners', 'are', 'few', 'pleasures', 'rival', 'completely', 'sedentary', 'evening', 'spent', 'most', 'sardonic', 'friends', 'cackling', 'freshmen', 'hallucinogens', 'movies', 'Boxing', 'Helena.Boxing', 'Helena', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'hilarious', '104', 'minutes', '1993', 'initial', 'buzz', 'surrounded', 'film', 'insistently', 'referring', 'bound', 'be', 'controversial', 'assassinated', 'potential', 'audience', 'uproarious', 'trash', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'begin', 'was', 'said', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'saw', 'tried', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'embarrassed', 'non-budging', 'theater', 'managers', 'lovers', 'Bad', 'Movies', 'owning', 'film', 'whole', 'other', 'story', 'When', 'pop', 'DVD', 'player', 'home', 'friends', 'welcome', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'anticipate', 'ludicrous', 'transformation', 'Sherilynn', 'Fenn', 'will', 'go', 'Furthermore', 'Helena', 'so', 'seriously', 'can', 'only', 'respond', 'gales', 'derisive', 'crowing.Fenn', 'convincing', 'man-eating', 'b-tch', 'who', 'mistake', 'sleeping', 'just', 'once', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'prominent', 'surgeon', 'obviously', 'sort', 'thumbsucking', 'psycho', 'mother', 'used', 'parade', 'house', 'naked', 'Obsessed', 'Fenn', ""'d"", 'rather', 'be', 'bulldozed', 'speeding', 'truck', 'speak', 'Sands', 'tree', 'spy', 'bedroom', 'covert', 'phone', 'calls', 'eventually', 'party', 'dances', 'fountain', 'kidding', 'favorite', 'scene', 'natch', 'guy', 'flipped-out', 'doc', 'steamed', 'up', 'apparently', 'edge.Soon', 'enough', 'kismet', 'strikes', 'Party-girl', 'Fenn', 'bulldozed', 'speeding', 'truck', 'right', 'Sands', 'estate', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'up', 'legs', 'mansion', 'Not', 'best', 'moods', 'head', 'anything', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'room', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Sands', 'soon', 'armless', 'too', 'revealed', 'when', 'spoonfeeding', 'have', 'just', 'one', 'question', 'straight', 'face', 'Just', 'try', 'stem', 'reflex', 'ask', 'Where', 'hell', 'are', 'arms', 'As', 'improbable', 'may', 'seem', 'love', 'sure', ""'d"", 'fall', 'love', 'someone', 'who', 'cut', 'off', 'arms', 'legs', 'too', 'not', 'however', 'stop', 'incessant', 'talking', 'can', 'only', 'presume', 'Sands', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'cutting', 'head', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'ended', 'first', 'Fenn', 'Sands', 'are', 'hopelessly', 'earnest', 'supporting', 'cast', 'either', 'superb', 'handle', 'nonsense', 'witness', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'shag-haired', 'rock', 'stud', 'have', 'wandered', 'street', 'Art', 'Garfunkel', 'Sands', 'pal', 'around', 'silent', 'daze', 'someone', 'told', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'was', 'supposed', 'show', 'up.This', 'movie', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'had', 'fight', 'heck', 'get', 'not', 'mention', 'cough', 'hefty', 'fine', 'best', 'few', 'mil', 'ever', 'spent', 'writer/director', 'Jennifer', 'Lynch', 'weirdo', 'daughter', 'David', '23-year-old', 'director', 'who', 'posed', 'press', 'shots', 'front', 'Venus', 'de', 'Milo', 'talked', 'how', ""'re"", 'own', 'boxes', ""'ve"", 'got', 'give', 'least', 'laugh', 'not']",N/A
