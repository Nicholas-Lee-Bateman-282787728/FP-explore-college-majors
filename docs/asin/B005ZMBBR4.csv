1505890,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005ZMBBR4,A kids review,"[9, 12]","Historical epics have been a part of Chinese cinema for a long time, and now that Jackie Chan has grown just a tad too old to pull the insane stunts of his youth, it makes sense that his latest film, his first directorial effort since 1998's Who Am I?, is 1911, a historical drama about the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew China's last imperial dynasty. Released on the 100th anniversary of the revolution and marking Chan's 100th film, 1911 was unfortunately a failure here in the States, where it took home just over $135,000 at the box office is one of the worst films of Chan's career. The problem, is that the film relies too heavily on title cards to explain already convoluted plot points, rendering the proceedings more akin to a history lesson than a piece of entertainment. If you aren't already familiar with the story taking place, you may find 1911 tedious, overlong, and dry, three words you'd never have thought to associate with a Jackie Chan movie.",1,1911,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,968,"['Historical', 'epics', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'Chinese', 'cinema', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'grown', 'just', 'tad', 'too', 'old', 'pull', 'insane', 'stunts', 'youth', 'sense', 'latest', 'film', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', '1998', 'Who', 'Am', '1911', 'historical', 'drama', 'Xinhai', 'Revolution', 'overthrew', 'China', 'last', 'imperial', 'dynasty', 'Released', '100th', 'anniversary', 'revolution', 'marking', 'Chan', '100th', 'film', '1911', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'failure', 'here', 'States', 'where', 'took', 'home', 'just', '135,000', 'box', 'office', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'Chan', 'career', 'problem', 'film', 'relies', 'too', 'heavily', 'title', 'cards', 'explain', 'already', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'points', 'rendering', 'proceedings', 'more', 'akin', 'history', 'lesson', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'are', ""n't"", 'already', 'familiar', 'story', 'taking', 'place', 'may', 'find', '1911', 'tedious', 'overlong', 'dry', 'three', 'words', ""'d"", 'never', 'have', 'thought', 'associate', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movie']",N/A
1505891,A28Z84QTQ3ZLF3,B005ZMBBR4,a movie fan,"[5, 6]","I had been looking for a good book covering Chinese history of the early 20th C, so this film caught my eye in the store. I hadn't heard of it, and can't vouch too much for verisimilitude, although it certainly looks as if a major effort was put into capturing the look and feel of the period, and to document the events (on screen, during the film). It was certainly entertaining, and I appreciated it being offered at 99 minutes, because it is an ARDUOUS FILM to process. The characters speak very fast, and talk a lot, so the subtitles go blazing past. You barely have time to see the words of one line, before another replaces it. Mercifully, the main subtitles are large and white, and easy to see against the many dark backgrounds, but their velocity is not for the headache-prone. In addition, all the characters are identified onscreen with very small Chinese and English printing, and the events transpiring are also given historical documentation (dates and explanatory text) in microprint above the main subtitles. It's like speedreading three books at once, while you are watching a movie. I have a home theater with a 10' screen, and I bought the Blu-ray, and those are the only reasons I could get through the film. Trying to watch this on a TV, even an HD TV, would be infuriating, I think. It was meant to be a theater experience, not a TV show.I also detest chop-socky films, and this production is free of that for 98 minutes. I guess they couldn't resist putting in one ludicrously incongruent MA clown fight, the gravity and tone of the rest of the film only serving to exaggerate the inappropriateness of doing so. Imagine Kenneth Mars' Nazi character from The Producers in Schindler's List and you get the idea.All in all, though, it is a handsomely mounted and high-minded look at a corner of history not many of us are likely to know very well. I good biography of Sun Yat-Sen would probably clarify things. My one real complaint with the serious history is that it is easy to lose track of which side you're watching during the battles. The movie moves quickly, and can be confusing. It also doesn't help that the foreigners are mostly poorly acted, cardboard characters, but they don't have much screen time.I think the ridiculous paean to the Communist Party at the end of the film is probably just a thank you for filming in China, and no big deal. It might even be perceived as a veiled comment that the revolutionary ideals discussed at length in the film have not yet been realized.Amplified in translation: the General orders his artillery officer to set the range for 2400 miles.

1505892,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B005ZMBBR4,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[43, 52]","Dynamic actor Jackie Chan is working hard in trying to leave a firm and strong legacy in Chinese cinema and cinema in general. Perhaps he wants to demonstrate that his talents are not exclusively in martial arts films and comedies, but also in dramatic roles. And I'm happy to say that he successfully does that in ""1911 Revolution,"" a formidable and epic film about one of China's defining moments in its tortured history. Historical movies just don't get better than this.The film opens with the execution of Qiu Jin, in Shaoxing. She was a member of the Tongmenghui, a revolutionary council that wanted to end the imperial government. We are then taken to San Francisco, on April 26, 1911, when Dr. Sun Yat-Sen (Winston Chao) is speaking at a fundraiser to the Chinese community in that city, in order that money could be collected for the revolutionary army that was fighting the Qing Dynasty. It was thought, we learn, that ""overseas Chinese people were the mothers of the revolution."" Next, we see Huang Xing (Jackie Chan) commanding an attack on the governor's mansion, in the so-called Guangzhou uprising. Sadly, the uprising fails, but Huang Xing survives and continues the insurrection. Dr. Sun Yat-Sen remains in foreign countries trying to provide funds for the revolution and stop the support of the Qing Dynasty by foreign powers. From then on, we witness, step by step, the history of the revolution that ended feudalism in China and brought down the Qing, the final dynasty in the history of the republic.""1911 Revolution"" is magnificently full of historic information, which directors Jackie Chan and Li Zhang were able to condense in the film's 99 minutes. It is a true epic, with overpowering cinematography, astonishing production design and dramatic battle scenes. Joan Chen shines as Qing Empress Dowager (Longyu), who finally abdicated on February 12, 1912, ending 2,000 years of monarchy. And don't expect funny and martial arts scenes from Jackie Chan - well, there is one fighting scene, which I suspect was placed just for the hell of it. This is a serious role for Chan, who does it well. In addition, it is my understanding that this might be Chan's 100th film. The two-disc Blu-ray edition of the movie also includes deleted scenes, making-of feature, interview with actress Li Bing Bing, and more.

This movie has sweeping cinematography and absolutely epic sets and battle scenes, but it's all lost as the story telling is extremely poor and the microscopic white font story boards are absolutely impossible to read.  Even pausing the DVD, you can't read them on a regular television set because the letters are so small that anything but a high-definition television cannot seperate the pixels enough to make them readible - no joke.The movie jumps around constantly, from the actual revolution to several years before, so if you're not paying VERY close attention, you will get lost quickly.  It also introduces FAR too many characters, most of whom don't live long enough in the movie to have seemingly even warranted an introduction.  Jackie Chan IS in this movie quite a bit, so I don't know what those complaints are about.  Chan does a fantastic job of dramatic acting in this one, not his normal fare, but he does a great job.  The problem is, he has directed and written a movie that's completely scrambled.  I LOVE historically based period movies and this one has all the ingredients to be an epic classic - however, it's so jumbled up that it's almost painful to try and watch.Also, this IS NOT about anything ""communist"" as some have stated, this was the 1911 revolution to establish a free Chinese Republic - NOT a communist state.  The weapons, uniforms, and battle scenes warranted three stars, but this movie needs to be doctored, spliced together in a different fashion, and have the voice overs changed by someone who knows what they're doing.

Empress Dowager is not a strong ruler.  Her political and economical misssteps lead country to financial dependence from strong european countries like England and Germany.  China is borrowing money to build railways and its citizens are dying of hunger and poverty.For anyone familiar with European history: French Revolution, Russian Revolution, etc.  these events are recipe for disaster. Intellectuals and peasants alike ask for change and that entails getting rid of the feudal system and autocracy that lasted in China for over 2,000 years.  Many young people rebel and start fighting on the streets in order to make a change.  Their leader is Sun-Yat Sen, young medical doctor, living in exile (San Francisco) who is devoting his time to raising money and recruiting fighters to change China.  It is important film because it reflects on the real events that happended in China nearly 100 years ago.  What happened then made a foundation of China we know today.There are too many characters in the film and peopl unfamiliar withthe names of Chinese provinces, may find movie confusing.  Some of the subtitles explaining characters and events are in such samll print, it is next to impossible to read them without pausing a movie.  In any case it is a spectacle and rematicised way of looking at one of the most important events in Chinese history.",4,100 years of Chinese revolution,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",2012,1485,"['Jackie', 'Chan', 'film', 'made', 'Chinese', 'revolution', '1911', 'time', 'Qing', 'dynasty', 'ruling', 'vast', 'country', 'Empress', 'Dowager', 'not', 'strong', 'ruler', 'political', 'economical', 'misssteps', 'lead', 'country', 'financial', 'dependence', 'strong', 'european', 'countries', 'England', 'Germany', 'China', 'borrowing', 'money', 'build', 'railways', 'citizens', 'are', 'dying', 'hunger', 'poverty.For', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'European', 'history', 'French', 'Revolution', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'etc', 'events', 'are', 'recipe', 'disaster', 'Intellectuals', 'peasants', 'alike', 'ask', 'change', 'getting', 'rid', 'feudal', 'system', 'autocracy', 'lasted', 'China', '2,000', 'years', 'Many', 'young', 'people', 'rebel', 'start', 'fighting', 'streets', 'order', 'make', 'change', 'leader', 'Sun-Yat', 'Sen', 'young', 'medical', 'doctor', 'living', 'exile', 'San', 'Francisco', 'who', 'devoting', 'time', 'raising', 'money', 'recruiting', 'fighters', 'change', 'China', 'important', 'film', 'real', 'events', 'happended', 'China', 'nearly', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'What', 'happened', 'then', 'made', 'foundation', 'China', 'know', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'film', 'peopl', 'unfamiliar', 'withthe', 'names', 'Chinese', 'provinces', 'may', 'find', 'movie', 'confusing', 'subtitles', 'explaining', 'characters', 'events', 'are', 'such', 'samll', 'print', 'next', 'impossible', 'read', 'pausing', 'movie', 'case', 'spectacle', 'rematicised', 'way', 'looking', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'events', 'Chinese', 'history']",N/A

1505905,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B005ZMBBR4,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]",The movie starts with a failed battle in the Revolution. The reasons why the Qing dynasty is being deposed is not mentioned until later in the story and then only in abstract fashion. Much of the movie concentrates on overseas Chinese money funding the revolution as well as the attempts to stop foreign investors from loaning money to the Qing dynasty. This gives you a behind the scenes look at a revolution.The movie was littered with patriotic slogans and noble causes to the point it interfered with the smoothness of the production as a historical piece into a modern Chinese patriot production. The message of the revolution is of self sacrifice for the good of the nation and don't forget to keep sending those dollars back home. I felt lost a few times during the film and that the producers of the movie had less historical integrity than an Oliver Stone film. The attempt to make heroes out of everyone who participated in the revolution was over done. I kept waiting for them to cut off the emperor's head and parade it through the streets and then I got really disappointed. Seems the Chinese are not French. I could never relate to the characters.,2,USE RED PAINT FOR THE FLAG,1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,1161,"['movie', 'failed', 'battle', 'Revolution', 'reasons', 'why', 'Qing', 'dynasty', 'being', 'deposed', 'not', 'mentioned', 'later', 'story', 'then', 'only', 'abstract', 'fashion', 'Much', 'movie', 'overseas', 'Chinese', 'money', 'funding', 'revolution', 'as', 'well', 'attempts', 'stop', 'foreign', 'investors', 'loaning', 'money', 'Qing', 'dynasty', 'scenes', 'look', 'revolution.The', 'movie', 'was', 'littered', 'patriotic', 'slogans', 'noble', 'causes', 'point', 'interfered', 'smoothness', 'production', 'historical', 'piece', 'modern', 'Chinese', 'patriot', 'production', 'message', 'revolution', 'self', 'sacrifice', 'good', 'nation', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'keep', 'sending', 'dollars', 'back', 'home', 'felt', 'lost', 'few', 'times', 'film', 'producers', 'movie', 'had', 'less', 'historical', 'integrity', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'film', 'attempt', 'make', 'heroes', 'everyone', 'who', 'participated', 'revolution', 'was', 'done', 'kept', 'waiting', 'cut', 'off', 'emperor', 'head', 'parade', 'streets', 'then', 'got', 'really', 'disappointed', 'Chinese', 'are', 'not', 'French', 'could', 'never', 'relate', 'characters']",N/A
1505906,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B005ZMBBR4,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[2, 3]","This film was made to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution or Hsinhai Revolution also called The 1911 Revolution. It was part of a series of uprisings against the last Imperial dynasty that of the Qing Dynasty. The starting point is the Wuchang uprising where Jackie Chan playing Huang Xing leads a small group to slaughter, but inspired others to become `martyrs' for the cause.That is the historical basis for the film and the makers did try to get as much of their version of history across as possible. A lot of the reasons for the revolt were an accumulation of grievances and the out moded feudal system that still persisted by the Manchu minority ruling over the Han majority; this is not really touched upon in the film. What we do have is the work of revolutionary fund raiser Sun Yat Sen played by Winston Chao, and his efforts to thwart more foreign aid going to the Qing's coffers. There is also the internal politics and screaming self interest that goes on at the Imperial court.All of this is balanced fairly well with lots of fighting that is done in that colour filter way to add realism and on the whole is very good. The problem here is speed and editing. Every time a new character or location appears we have small print sub titles coming up in both Mandarin and English. Not only are they nigh on impossible to read on even a large TV, they also appear for a few seconds whilst at the same time the other subs for the dialogue appear too. Even using the pause button it was still a bit of a chore.Then we have the foreigners who are all cardboard cut outs and played by some D list drama school drop outs, they even all appear to be dubbed; which is woeful. They are presented as all detestable and rude whilst being smug and selfish, whilst all of the revolutionaries are shining beacons of self sacrifice and service to the nation. We do have some ambiguous characters but they get so little screen time that we do not get much of a chance for any intrigue to build up. Also the other characters, of which there are many, are all only bit players so little chance to get much in the empathy bank too. I feel they tried to cram too much history in and were unsure of the vehicle, so had a kind of action propaganda idea with a love interest shoe horned in between Chan and Bingbing Li.This also appears to have been edited down from the original film from 118 minutes to 95 or so, and I have no idea why; you do get over 100 minutes of extras though. This was co-directed by Chan and he may have bitten off a bit too much, also it is painfully obvious that allowances were made for the Chinese authorities who see the 1911 revolution as the beginning of modern China, which of course it was not, as that was fought for a republic and not a centrally planned Communist system.All of that aside this is far from being a turkey, it just could have been a lot better historically and even failing that as a film, it is too busy, too rushed and too ambitious with too many barriers to achieve that ambition. In the end we have a passable film that is part action and part political shenanigans. This has scored particularly badly on Rotten Tomatoes, in the single figures at present, but that could be because in America this was billed as a Jackie Chan movie, and it is not a martial arts fest, he only does that in one scene, and is trying to do serious drama. Whilst that is all well and good, I think next time he might want to let someone else sit in the director's chair.",3,China Historical Epic with Mr Chan,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,3518,"['film', 'was', 'made', 'celebrate', '100', 'year', 'anniversary', 'Xinhai', 'Revolution', 'Hsinhai', 'Revolution', 'also', 'called', '1911', 'Revolution', 'was', 'part', 'series', 'uprisings', 'last', 'Imperial', 'dynasty', 'Qing', 'Dynasty', 'starting', 'point', 'Wuchang', 'uprising', 'where', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'playing', 'Huang', 'Xing', 'small', 'group', 'slaughter', 'inspired', 'others', 'become', 'martyrs', 'cause.That', 'historical', 'basis', 'film', 'makers', 'did', 'try', 'get', 'much', 'version', 'history', 'possible', 'lot', 'reasons', 'revolt', 'were', 'accumulation', 'grievances', 'out', 'moded', 'feudal', 'system', 'still', 'persisted', 'Manchu', 'minority', 'ruling', 'Han', 'majority', 'not', 'really', 'touched', 'film', 'What', 'do', 'have', 'work', 'revolutionary', 'fund', 'raiser', 'Sun', 'Yat', 'Sen', 'played', 'Winston', 'Chao', 'efforts', 'thwart', 'more', 'foreign', 'aid', 'going', 'Qing', 'coffers', 'also', 'internal', 'politics', 'screaming', 'interest', 'Imperial', 'court.All', 'balanced', 'fairly', 'well', 'lots', 'fighting', 'done', 'colour', 'filter', 'way', 'add', 'realism', 'whole', 'very', 'good', 'problem', 'here', 'speed', 'editing', 'time', 'new', 'character', 'location', 'have', 'small', 'print', 'sub', 'titles', 'coming', 'up', 'Mandarin', 'English', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'nigh', 'impossible', 'read', 'even', 'large', 'TV', 'also', 'appear', 'few', 'seconds', 'whilst', 'same', 'time', 'other', 'subs', 'dialogue', 'appear', 'too', 'Even', 'using', 'pause', 'button', 'was', 'still', 'bit', 'chore.Then', 'have', 'foreigners', 'who', 'are', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'outs', 'played', 'D', 'list', 'drama', 'school', 'drop', 'outs', 'even', 'appear', 'be', 'dubbed', 'woeful', 'are', 'presented', 'detestable', 'rude', 'whilst', 'being', 'smug', 'selfish', 'whilst', 'revolutionaries', 'are', 'shining', 'beacons', 'self', 'sacrifice', 'service', 'nation', 'do', 'have', 'ambiguous', 'characters', 'get', 'so', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'chance', 'intrigue', 'build', 'up', 'Also', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'many', 'are', 'only', 'bit', 'players', 'so', 'little', 'chance', 'get', 'much', 'empathy', 'bank', 'too', 'feel', 'tried', 'cram', 'too', 'much', 'history', 'were', 'unsure', 'vehicle', 'so', 'had', 'kind', 'action', 'propaganda', 'idea', 'love', 'interest', 'shoe', 'horned', 'Chan', 'Bingbing', 'Li.This', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'down', 'original', 'film', '118', 'minutes', '95', 'so', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'do', 'get', '100', 'minutes', 'extras', 'was', 'co-directed', 'Chan', 'may', 'have', 'bitten', 'off', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'also', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'allowances', 'were', 'made', 'Chinese', 'authorities', 'who', 'see', '1911', 'revolution', 'beginning', 'modern', 'China', 'course', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'fought', 'republic', 'not', 'centrally', 'planned', 'Communist', 'system.All', 'aside', 'far', 'being', 'turkey', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'historically', 'even', 'failing', 'film', 'too', 'busy', 'too', 'rushed', 'too', 'ambitious', 'too', 'many', 'barriers', 'achieve', 'ambition', 'end', 'have', 'passable', 'film', 'part', 'action', 'part', 'political', 'shenanigans', 'scored', 'particularly', 'badly', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'single', 'figures', 'present', 'could', 'be', 'because', 'America', 'was', 'billed', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'movie', 'not', 'martial', 'arts', 'fest', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'trying', 'do', 'serious', 'drama', 'Whilst', 'well', 'good', 'think', 'next', 'time', 'might', 'want', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'sit', 'director', 'chair']",N/A
1505907,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005ZMBBR4,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 4]","""1911"" is marketed as Jackie Chan's 100th film. I think there is no need to write about the outstanding career and incredible life story of the star (who acts as a co-director here). What I have to say is that he is just part of the ensemble cast in this Chinese historical drama. If you are looking for his martial arts action, this is not your film.Those who are interested in the modern history of China know that 1911 is the year of the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing Dynasty. Not being an expert on Chinese history, I have only limited knowledge about the revolution. Still, I can say ""1911"" is beautifully shot and largely well-acted ... and feels like reading a textbook.I'm sorry to say this, but with all respect to Jackie Chan, co-director Li Zhang (his first feature) and those who are involved in making the film, ""1911"" is boring, devoid of compelling narrative. Winston Chao plays a revolutionary Sun Yat-sen. Jackie Chan portrays Huang Xing, his friend and also a military commander. With a casual research through the internet, you will learn a few things about their dramatic life stories. The film is very serious and earnest (not a bad thing in itself), but fails to present the dramatic aspect of their life.Featuring a huge cast of characters including the Empress Dowager Longyu (Joan Chen) and Huang Xing's wife Xu Zonghan (Bingbing Li), the film is often rushed. In spite of large-scale battle sequences, the film lacks emotional impact, suffering from its uneven pace and chronologically and geographically confusing narrative.In conclusion, ""1911"" needs more time and a better script to be what it strives to be, an emotionally charged historical epic.",2,Jackie Chan's 100th Film Is a Rather Disappointing Historical Epic,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",2012,1689,"['1911', 'marketed', 'Jackie', 'Chan', '100th', 'film', 'think', 'need', 'write', 'outstanding', 'career', 'incredible', 'life', 'story', 'star', 'who', 'co-director', 'here', 'What', 'have', 'say', 'just', 'part', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Chinese', 'historical', 'drama', 'are', 'looking', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'not', 'film.Those', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'modern', 'history', 'China', 'know', '1911', 'year', 'Xinhai', 'Revolution', 'overthrew', 'Qing', 'Dynasty', 'Not', 'being', 'expert', 'Chinese', 'history', 'have', 'only', 'limited', 'knowledge', 'revolution', 'Still', 'can', 'say', '1911', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'largely', 'well-acted', 'feels', 'reading', 'textbook.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'respect', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'co-director', 'Li', 'Zhang', 'first', 'feature', 'who', 'are', 'involved', 'making', 'film', '1911', 'boring', 'devoid', 'compelling', 'narrative', 'Winston', 'Chao', 'revolutionary', 'Sun', 'Yat-sen.', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'Huang', 'Xing', 'friend', 'also', 'military', 'commander', 'casual', 'research', 'internet', 'will', 'learn', 'few', 'things', 'dramatic', 'life', 'stories', 'film', 'very', 'serious', 'earnest', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'present', 'dramatic', 'aspect', 'life.Featuring', 'huge', 'cast', 'characters', 'including', 'Empress', 'Dowager', 'Longyu', 'Joan', 'Chen', 'Huang', 'Xing', 'wife', 'Xu', 'Zonghan', 'Bingbing', 'Li', 'film', 'often', 'rushed', 'spite', 'large-scale', 'battle', 'sequences', 'film', 'emotional', 'impact', 'suffering', 'uneven', 'pace', 'chronologically', 'geographically', 'confusing', 'narrative.In', 'conclusion', '1911', 'more', 'time', 'better', 'script', 'be', 'what', 'be', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'historical', 'epic']",N/A
