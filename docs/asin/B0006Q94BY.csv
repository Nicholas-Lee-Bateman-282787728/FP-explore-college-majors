872425,A1IL6W1NK05UW9,B0006Q94BY,"C. Baker ""cbaker""","[39, 41]","This New England Patriots Super Bowl XXXIX video is simply a must have for New England Patriots fans, despite some of its drawbacks.This video is essentially an hour-long highlights reel of the New England Patriot's 2004 season.  It has highlights of each and every regular season and playoff game, and of course a more detailed highlights package of the Super Bowl itself.  The video is interspersed with sound bites from player and coach interviews and the sidelines throughout the season.The video does not do a great job of building drama throughout the regular season and the playoffs.  But of course, there wasn't all that much drama given New England only lost two games and went 14-2.  It does, however, do a decent job spotlighting the impact of the regular season loss to Pittsburgh and the mounting injuries to the team's defensive backs.  It also does a good job of profiling Cory Dillon's impact on the Patriot's running game during the regular season and playoffs and gives Troy Brown's defensive back play some much deserved airtime.  Like last year, I wish the video had more highlights, more commentary, and more inside information.  But overall, it was a mostly complete package.The best part of the DVD was it has the entire international game broadcast on it.  It is awesome to have the entire game on DVD as a keepsake, even though I also taped it on VHS.  This year the announcers for that broadcast were Dick Stockton and Darryl Johnston, who I thought were excellent.  It is without commercials, of course, and includes key statistics during the game and shots of fans and replays.  It's a surprising well-edited film of the game given the speed with which the DVD was produced.The other special features included a number of pre and post game interviews with New England players and coaches, which were interesting but short.  It also included the entire halftime show with Paul McCartney, which for me I could have cared less about but it will no doubt appeal to many others.  I wonder why last year's DVD didn't include the halftime show?  (Ha! Ha!)I was very disappointed that the DVD did not include the ESPN NFL Match-Up analyzing the Super Bowl, which is really a fabulous breakdown of the game.  That was a really big plus for last year's Super Bowl XXXVIII DVD.  But of course, this year's Super Bowl was on Fox so they aren't going to allow promotion of another network's program.Despite my quibbles with some aspects of the DVD, if you are a New England Patriots fan you will no doubt enjoy this more than once.  I don't think non-New England Patriots fans would like the DVD that much because it is essentially a highlights reel of the Patriot's season and does not do any in-depth breakdown of the game or season that an avid football fan would be looking for.",4,Excellent Keepsake for Patriots Fans,1110499200,"03 11, 2005",2005,2797,"['New', 'England', 'Patriots', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XXXIX', 'video', 'simply', 'must', 'have', 'New', 'England', 'Patriots', 'fans', 'drawbacks.This', 'video', 'essentially', 'hour-long', 'highlights', 'reel', 'New', 'England', 'Patriot', '2004', 'season', 'highlights', 'regular', 'season', 'playoff', 'game', 'course', 'more', 'detailed', 'highlights', 'package', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'video', 'interspersed', 'sound', 'bites', 'player', 'coach', 'interviews', 'sidelines', 'season.The', 'video', 'not', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'building', 'drama', 'regular', 'season', 'playoffs', 'course', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'drama', 'given', 'New', 'England', 'only', 'lost', 'two', 'games', 'went', '14-2', 'however', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'spotlighting', 'impact', 'regular', 'season', 'loss', 'Pittsburgh', 'mounting', 'injuries', 'team', 'defensive', 'backs', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'profiling', 'Cory', 'Dillon', 'impact', 'Patriot', 'running', 'game', 'regular', 'season', 'playoffs', 'Troy', 'Brown', 'defensive', 'back', 'play', 'much', 'deserved', 'airtime', 'last', 'year', 'wish', 'video', 'had', 'more', 'highlights', 'more', 'commentary', 'more', 'inside', 'information', 'overall', 'was', 'mostly', 'complete', 'package.The', 'best', 'part', 'DVD', 'was', 'entire', 'international', 'game', 'broadcast', 'awesome', 'have', 'entire', 'game', 'DVD', 'keepsake', 'even', 'also', 'taped', 'VHS', 'year', 'announcers', 'broadcast', 'were', 'Dick', 'Stockton', 'Darryl', 'Johnston', 'who', 'thought', 'were', 'excellent', 'commercials', 'course', 'key', 'statistics', 'game', 'shots', 'fans', 'replays', 'surprising', 'well-edited', 'film', 'game', 'given', 'speed', 'DVD', 'was', 'produced.The', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'number', 'pre', 'post', 'game', 'interviews', 'New', 'England', 'players', 'coaches', 'were', 'interesting', 'short', 'also', 'included', 'entire', 'halftime', 'show', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'could', 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'will', 'no', 'doubt', 'appeal', 'many', 'others', 'wonder', 'why', 'last', 'year', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'halftime', 'show', 'Ha', 'Ha', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'ESPN', 'NFL', 'Match-Up', 'analyzing', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'really', 'fabulous', 'breakdown', 'game', 'was', 'really', 'big', 'plus', 'last', 'year', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'XXXVIII', 'DVD', 'course', 'year', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'was', 'Fox', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'allow', 'promotion', 'network', 'program.Despite', 'quibbles', 'aspects', 'DVD', 'are', 'New', 'England', 'Patriots', 'fan', 'will', 'doubt', 'enjoy', 'more', 'once', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'non-New', 'England', 'Patriots', 'fans', 'would', 'like', 'DVD', 'much', 'essentially', 'highlights', 'reel', 'Patriot', 'season', 'not', 'do', 'in-depth', 'breakdown', 'game', 'season', 'avid', 'football', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'looking']",Super Bowl XXXIX - New England Patriots Championship Video

This DVD will make the perfect gift for the young sports fanatic or for your father or the special man in your life for Father's Day. Super Bowl XXXIX is now available on DVD. This reasonably priced release features highlights from the season and shows how the Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles made it to the big game. The DVD is really primarily about the winners--The New England Patriots who have seemingly created a NFL dynasty.The DVD has almost everything someone wanting to relive the Super Bowl could ask for. The only thing missing is---the commercials. You won't see all those cool commercials on the DVD release. The good news is that you do get the half time show. The bad news is that it is a rather un-superbowl worthy performance by Sir Paul McCartney. I guess the NFL really tried to play it safe after Nipplegate. You get the entire TV broadcast of the game. The DVD also includes media day highlights and post game press conferences and interviews with the players and the coaches.This set will be the perfect gift for fans of the NFL, the New England Patriots, or fans of the Philadelphia Eagles.

872430,AYUFQY3XG4ZBR,B0006Q94BY,"Johnny Sideburns ""21st Century Renaissance Man""","[2, 3]","By winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of New Englanders wins its first World Series in 86 years.It's true, the Patriots somehow pieced together a team that, despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as Super Bowl champions with a 17-2 record (which just as easily could have/should have been 18-1)...but the 2004 Boston Red Sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the American Sports atmosphere and somehow the 2004 Patriots season just doesn't seem to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003.  Part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities (2001 having 9/11, the coming-of-age of Tom Brady, the Snow Bowl, and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting Super Bowl ever.  2003 had the release of Lawyer Milloy, the early stumbles to Buffalo and Washington, the birth of the winning streak, winter weather in Foxboro, and yet another thrilling Super Bowl finish); 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison, like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the ""W"" on the Patriots' side of the field.This is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling...the injuries (leading to the incredible ""throwback"" two-way play of veteran Wide Receiver/rookie Cornerback Troy Brown), the continued winning streak, the rebirth of offseason acquisition Corey Dillon, the continuing mastery of the Indianapolis Colts, and the return to Pittsburgh (where the record 21-game winning streak came to an emphatic end on Halloween (just days after the Red Sox won the World Series, karmically enough), where University of Michigan graduate Tom Brady resurrected himself from a triple-digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the NFL to send the Patriots back to the Super Bowl, this time in the unfairly maligned city of Jacksonville, FL.No nail-biting endings this time, though...despite the best efforts of Terrell Owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else (with the possible exception of Curt Schilling, of course), the Eagles All-Pro was clearly the second-best receiver on the field as Deion Branch won the Super Bowl MVP for a record day (Safetyman and Render Of Mayhem Extraordinaire Rodney Harrison would have been my pick, actually) and the Patriots, though trailing early, never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final score of 24-21 which in truth flattered the Eagles more than they deserved.Far be it that a season ending with a record of 17-2 and another Super Bowl ring should be considered hum-drum, but there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that, impressive as it was, just doesn't translate to the memorable re-telling that the Pats' previous title years do.  This is a great DVD for Pats fans, indispensible even, but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good NFL season can bring, I would recommend either of the previous Patriots highlights DVD's over this one.",4,How does a Super Bowl champion end up overlooked in its own home town?,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,3264,"['winning', 'third', 'title', 'four', 'years', 'same', 'year', 'baseball', 'team', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'generations', 'New', 'Englanders', 'first', 'World', 'Series', '86', 'years.It', 'true', 'Patriots', 'somehow', 'pieced', 'together', 'team', 'string', 'injuries', 'seemed', 'defy', 'rationality', 'managed', 'finish', 'second', 'consecutive', 'campaign', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'champions', '17-2', 'record', 'just', 'easily', 'could', 'have/should', 'have', 'been', '18-1', '2004', 'Boston', 'Red', 'Sox', 'completely', 'sucked', 'oxygen', 'American', 'Sports', 'atmosphere', 'somehow', '2004', 'Patriots', 'season', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'measure', 'up', 'previous', 'title', 'years', '2001', '2003', 'Part', 'reason', 'previous', 'years', 'seemed', 'have', 'own', 'personalities', '2001', 'having', '9/11', 'coming-of-age', 'Tom', 'Brady', 'Snow', 'Bowl', 'unbelievable', 'finish', 'what', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'exciting', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'ever', '2003', 'had', 'release', 'Lawyer', 'Milloy', 'early', 'stumbles', 'Buffalo', 'Washington', 'birth', 'winning', 'streak', 'winter', 'weather', 'Foxboro', 'yet', 'thrilling', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'finish', '2004', 'just', 'seemed', 'anticlimax', 'comparison', 'were', 'watching', 'scripted', 'performance', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'end', 'W', 'Patriots', 'side', 'field.This', 'not', 'say', 'were', 'not', 'intriguing', 'challenges', 'made', 'good', 'storytelling', 'injuries', 'leading', 'incredible', 'throwback', 'two-way', 'play', 'veteran', 'Wide', 'Receiver/rookie', 'Cornerback', 'Troy', 'Brown', 'continued', 'winning', 'streak', 'rebirth', 'offseason', 'acquisition', 'Corey', 'Dillon', 'continuing', 'mastery', 'Indianapolis', 'Colts', 'return', 'Pittsburgh', 'where', 'record', '21-game', 'winning', 'streak', 'came', 'emphatic', 'end', 'Halloween', 'just', 'days', 'Red', 'Sox', 'won', 'World', 'Series', 'karmically', 'enough', 'where', 'University', 'Michigan', 'graduate', 'Tom', 'Brady', 'resurrected', 'triple-digit', 'fever', 'night', 'thoroughly', 'dismantle', 'best', 'regarded', 'defense', 'NFL', 'send', 'Patriots', 'back', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'time', 'unfairly', 'maligned', 'city', 'Jacksonville', 'FL.No', 'nail-biting', 'endings', 'time', 'best', 'efforts', 'Terrell', 'Owens', 'come', 'back', 'leg', 'ankle', 'injury', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'season', 'anyone', 'else', 'possible', 'exception', 'Curt', 'Schilling', 'course', 'Eagles', 'All-Pro', 'was', 'clearly', 'second-best', 'receiver', 'field', 'Deion', 'Branch', 'won', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'MVP', 'record', 'day', 'Safetyman', 'Render', 'Mayhem', 'Extraordinaire', 'Rodney', 'Harrison', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pick', 'actually', 'Patriots', 'trailing', 'early', 'never', 'really', 'seemed', 'doubt', 'winning', 'game', 'led', '10', 'points', 'late', 'prevailing', 'final', 'score', '24-21', 'truth', 'flattered', 'Eagles', 'more', 'deserved.Far', 'be', 'season', 'ending', 'record', '17-2', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'ring', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'hum-drum', 'was', 'something', 'missing', '2004', 'campaign', 'impressive', 'was', 'just', ""n't"", 'translate', 'memorable', 're-telling', 'Pats', 'previous', 'title', 'years', 'do', 'great', 'DVD', 'Pats', 'fans', 'indispensible', 'even', 'casual', 'fan', 'who', 'drama', 'good', 'NFL', 'season', 'can', 'bring', 'would', 'recommend', 'previous', 'Patriots', 'highlights', 'DVD', 'one']",Super Bowl XXXIX - New England Patriots Championship Video
